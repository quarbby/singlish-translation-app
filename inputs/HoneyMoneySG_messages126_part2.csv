How do we know if this has been fully redeemed?,btohqsg
How do you guys reach DCS for termination or fee waiver? By phone? I read it is not easy to reach them,btohqsg
A lot of people say give them a call  insist on cancelling  then bring up authorities if they refuse.,btohqsg
There is a number on their website to WhatsApp them. I WhatsApp them and they replied within a work day. Within a week I received email for card termination.,btohqsg
That's a big change from all the data points I've seen haha,btohqsg
I still never figured out why people sign up dcs. Good?,btohqsg
Oh that’s good to know  let me find,btohqsg

Hi.. I have a question. When I use my bank cc for deposit  it deducted 4556.93 from my card. It was AUD 5000. After refund  it was 4455.50.. therr is shortage of $101.43… is this normal?,btohqsg
It could be the fx difference ie the day of deduction and day of credit,btohqsg
I also thinking of fx difference.. but $100 seems to big of a difference,btohqsg
That is 2.22%? When they deduct n when they refund?,btohqsg
30 July deduct then 4 Aug refund,btohqsg
I was thinking if it’s better to use card like Youtrip instead? Their exchange rates are better..,btohqsg
It could really be the fx. The AUDSGD swung for past days just like other currencies. 0.88 to 0.86 and with your 5k  it's roughly 100bucks difference,btohqsg
Ya. I heard a lot are using youtrip. I prefer trust card. Rates not far off.,btohqsg
Any idea what is the cons for using YT for deposit?,btohqsg
Money gets stucked inside. Will recommend using trust instead,btohqsg
"I don't like the converted money stuck there.  It's like aewallet.myfriend likes it Bec she used it as a ""fx trading"" given that she will use the converted currency anyway.",btohqsg
If I apply for UOB priv miles or preferred platinum  will transactions on the card be part of the $500 UOB one account card spend?,btohqsg

Hi   can i stack the welcome offer of Vantage card (4k) and the DBS national card (5k) spending together ?,btohqsg
And for vantage card spending  contactless mobile transactions qualified?,btohqsg
No need to as interest is already calculated from last month MAB.,btohqsg
Going through the tnc it doesnt exclude dbs vantage. You can check with dbs cso if u want to be sure. And mobile contactless should be fine for dbs signup bonus,btohqsg

last time banks already do it..after Fujian Gang  the threshold to trigger an Enhanced Due Dilligence Review got lowered.no choice just have to deal with it if want to play the bonus interest game.,btohqsg
