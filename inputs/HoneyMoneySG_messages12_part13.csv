Now visa card can be used to top up amaze card? Any better visa card to pair up now for cashback,btohqsg
No  it‚Äôs considered wallet  no rewards for top up,btohqsg
I applied through the link on singsaver website but I spoke to CS  and they told me I applied through Citi online. Does this mean I‚Äôm not eligible for the gifts?,btohqsg
i subscribe ssb since may but seems interest keep increasing  is it good to cancel the early bond that i subscribe and subscribe new one since give higher interest ?,btohqsg
I think payout is every 6 mths right so it makes more sense to remove those that already given payouts. Else u gng spend 4 bux withdrawing and putting back and no interest,btohqsg
i think interest will still be given prorate if we redeem before 6 months ? CMIIW,btohqsg
how is this compared to citi cashback +,btohqsg
Yea they very anal about this one. Gotta see via which method is the better. I missed my prestige promo which wld be much better through citi online instead of singsaver that time. Smtms singsaver is better. Gotta be wary before sign up,btohqsg
Hmm yeah. Now seems like Citi said it wasn‚Äôt through Singsaver. But I applied through the Singsaver link. Not sure what seems to be the issue,btohqsg
What is the best card to use for travel related spending? (Eg booking hotel or destination tickets via Klook)thanks,btohqsg
Has anyone signed up for the SC Smart Card via Singsaver as well? Between this and Citi CB+  in terms of spending for dining and transport  SC would be better?,btohqsg
is better apply directly in SC website if u want 300$ cashback with no min spend,btohqsg
Moneysmart is $320 for $500 spend  SC direct is $300 no min,btohqsg
Means they will allocated $300 cash back even without using the card at all?,btohqsg
Moneysmart is $320 for $500 spend  SC direct is $300 no minSingsaver is $300 for $500 spendSo best option would be SC direct for the cash back  followed by money smart?,btohqsg
Not sure if this SC card is a better option than Citi CB+,btohqsg
Yep upon physical card activation.Moneysmart get extra $20 if you are going to spend $500 regardless,btohqsg
But let‚Äôs say if I apply through moneysmart and somehow bank says not eligible for the moneysmart promo  I‚Äôll be eligible for the bank one eithe way right?,btohqsg
Sorry  first time on the cash back. So the $300 cash back will be allocated upon activation. Can then use it to pay off bills for the next month right? Not tied down to anything?,btohqsg
You might want to call the bank and check  I'm just conveying info as per what is stated on the various websites,btohqsg
Ah alright. Thanks for the advice!,btohqsg
Anyone tried to pay with axs with trust card?is it possible to do it?,btohqsg
Oops yes I did and it‚Äôs okay alr. The extra 30 usd is a separate reward and it came in about an hour after asking here. Thanks!,btohqsg

Anyone tried withdrawing cash using grab pts from the Sheng Siong atm ?,btohqsg

SSB not much better now ?,btohqsg
Oh yes  SSB is way better and I am putting my assets in there.,btohqsg
dun look possible  can only use Grab points for Grab QR,btohqsg
above 3% normally allocation below 10k... unless you buy at every auction to maximise your exposure... if not  syfe gives you flexibility,btohqsg
Can I check for citi rewards + instarem amaze card if I were to make an overseas payment at the hotel do I get the miles pts?,btohqsg
Thanks  going overseas but unsure which miles card would be good for overseas spending eg. Hotel booking?,btohqsg
But i will be paying physically at the hotel  will I still earn miles with wwmc?,btohqsg
Any good card for these case  overseas contactless spend on hotel payment?,btohqsg
Guys  if topup too much into ezlink pay by wallet.How to get it out?,btohqsg
Call their hotline request refund  but your acc will be deleted  and the process takes quite long  1 month alr and my money still being processed,btohqsg
Can get it out by topping into another wallet then topping back to grab which is transferable,btohqsg
anyone tried UOB PRVI on expedia with shopback for 6mpd + cashback?,btohqsg
U have to go thru their uob link for it so I don't think can stack,btohqsg
Ooo interesting  nvr tried before so not sure if it works,btohqsg
i wouldn't mind trying if I get my miles,btohqsg
cashback as bonus  don't have then nvm,btohqsg
Yea  shopback tracking is usually quite accurate (and also shitty at times)  take cashback as bonus then üëçüëç,btohqsg
i wanna try  but scared i compromise my miles,btohqsg
