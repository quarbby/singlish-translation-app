and i remember on my app  it wasnt pending status so it should be already charged. i cant remember was i asking for the month before or the month itself.,btohqsg
b4 looking into telegram  i tried to search online for any kind of card in sg that supports google play merchant but found nothing(i know of) so far.but i realize in countries like US  they do have credit cards that give bonus to google play transactions,btohqsg
It is just so damn that they stop google play card,btohqsg
Weird. I had 2 transactions on google play this month and both got 10x pts. Is yours 1 time payment or recurring?,btohqsg
I always do 1 time payment,btohqsg
@antonio191203could you mind telling me let's say you spend it now. At what point do you check if u got 10x? Maybe I shall try that,btohqsg
When the transaction is posted  i.e. no longer pending  in ur transaction history page.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know what purchases by Uob Debit card will enable you to get the fastest update in the Uob debit expenses?,btohqsg
Anyone know that the proper channel to lodge complaint against DBS for double charging DCC for refunded amount? Since I don‚Äôt think other banks are charging DCC fees for refunded amount,btohqsg
Have you talked to dbs cso? Uob did the same to my agoda refund üò¢,btohqsg
Yes I have contacted DBS multiple times to refund the difference previously and they never rejected my request until recentlyThe cso told me previously was all done out of good will hence I have asked the cso to file an appeal for this current case,btohqsg
Means total u lost 2% of transacted amount? 1% cross border fee when purchased hotel room via Agoda then another 1% cross border fee when u cancel this booking to get refund.,btohqsg
Only one way  open at branch. Setup signature also. Then submit GIRO arrangements. And register for bonus interest promo.,btohqsg
Imma try it again. Btw what was the rate again?,btohqsg
The rate? Just round down and x10. Like 5.25 transaction will give 50 pts.,btohqsg
You never pay through Google Pay right? Just using your card details to pay on Google Play?,btohqsg
Hi Sky  on Dobin you can enter your statement date manually and the spend will be automatically calculated and shown on a progress bar  see the screenshot,btohqsg
Hi. Any way to check if we have fulfilled the criteria for ocbc 360? Similar to what uob has for one account,btohqsg
Hi which is the best cash back card for ocbc 360 and which is the best cash back card overall in sg,btohqsg
Hi GurusI will be making several travel expenses over the next few months.  I am currently holding UOB Solitaire card with travel as one of my preferred categories.  I would like to check what other card would give me the best value either in miles or cashback for the excess expenses of $2 000 per month.  I have recently cancelled my DBS Woman‚Äôs card  so that would be out of question. TIA!,btohqsg
Oh sweet ill check it out! Thanks for reaching out,btohqsg
Crmc? As long you paired them both with amaze  you'll benefit from 4mpd and fairly ok exchange rates.,btohqsg
Thanks!  I will definitely look at CRMC + Amaze for overseas expenses.  I was referring to travel expenses mainly on hotel and air tickets.  Sorry I wasn't clear about it.,btohqsg
Dont seem to have those options üòß,btohqsg
Yes I was change 1% for original one transaction which I am aware and ok with this  but I can‚Äôt accept they charge me another 1% from the refunded amount. This DCC problem only happens with Mastercard payments on Agoda.Every time I have refunds from Agoda to my DBS MC I have to call DBS to refund the difference. It‚Äôs a hassle with Agoda + DBS that I have to go through. And last few times DBS just refunded the difference without saying anything. But the cso I contacted today told me they were done out of good will  so in a way they are telling me it is normal for them to charge DCC fee twice even for refunded transactions.And I cannot bypass the DCC fee using amaze since DBS excluded amaze transactionsSome times I have to cancel bookings due to plan change  some times due to better rates etc and Agoda don‚Äôt want to honour the best price guarantee since they told me I booked using the DBS CC promo,btohqsg
Probably can consider UOB KF  it‚Äôs lower at 3mpd but has no cap,btohqsg
Depends on what criteria you are looking at  salary and save bonus you are able to see from ocbc web. But ocbc doesn‚Äôt have a spend tracker to let you know which posted transactions actually counts but so long as it‚Äôs not under the exclusions it should be counted,btohqsg
The spend progress bar widget is only displayed for cards where there is min spend to reach for accelerated earn. So not on the Citi Rewards Card - We can add it in a future release though if useful? (Fyi  I am a co-founder at Dobin),btohqsg
Cool so the function is somewhat there  just need to enable it for crmc. Looking forward. üôèüèª (yea i dont think anyone would deliberately use a dobin logo dp ;) ),btohqsg
I'm on the same situation as you. Double charges on DCC.,btohqsg
hi gurus! if i paid my hsbc cc bill using uob account and it showed like this  means bill is paid right? just confirming thanks!! üôèüèª,btohqsg
Maybank platinum visa vs family & friend . Which card better ? thanks,btohqsg
Then don't use agoda or dbs  especially this exact combination! üòÖ,btohqsg
Its more of agoda in this case. Their payment gateway is outside of Singapore üòÖ. Or only book at agoda if you are sure you wont cancel.,btohqsg

You need to provide the following information:1. The moomoo ID of the referer2. Screenshot of the chat history that your friend share the referral link with you (the screenshot including profile photo and time )Note: If there is nothing wrong with your information  it may take 7-10 business days for us to update your invitation relationship.,btohqsg
I shld be able to use this? ID will be hmsg? Thanks,btohqsg
Yes. Send the referral link and message link to them as well. It's an affiliate link so no moomoo id is applicable,btohqsg
Apparently they still ask for the ID,btohqsg
