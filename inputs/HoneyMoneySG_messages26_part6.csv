how much cash do you guys use in MY? now almost 95% of my tx are cashless with tng ewallet,btohqsg
When I went KL in October I didn't use cash at all actually,btohqsg
i am using for angpow lol,btohqsg
Outside of KL I think cash is still prevalent,btohqsg
If you have Trust Bank you can withdraw without fees,btohqsg
trust card without trust bank can?,btohqsg
I think you need the actual savings account + debit card  or it would be considered cash advance,btohqsg
hmm okay  i guess youtrip also ok? not alot of difference,btohqsg
if you're ok with the $5 flat fee then yah not much difference,btohqsg
I think people just buy giga buck I think,btohqsg
Actually yes most of them paid by card then only those night market pay cash,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows whats the best account (bank) if I have 290k to deposit for only 1-2 months? Without spending,btohqsg
I just applied for HSBC Revolution Card via SingSaver. Where do I find the Application Reference Number?,btohqsg
I applied ega recently too. How long it take to receive the debit card,btohqsg
I checked the email I gotten from HSBC within 5mins. I don't see the ref number,btohqsg
the email is titledDiscover a world of privileges with your HSBC credit card,btohqsg
Anyone knows if spree gets cashback for cardup?,btohqsg
Dun think I can convert ringgit and store. Only can store in major currency and SGD. For the rest they will just auto convert and deduct from SGD wallet when used in the country,btohqsg
HSBC credit card application does not have any application number. The singsaver referral number will be the last 4 digit of your mobile number.,btohqsg
Morning all  I think I saw this thread before but would like to clarify. So CRMC if use for grab will get 10x points but if CRMC + Amaze then wont be entitled?,btohqsg
Only rides and food will get 10x points for CRMC. If tagged to amaze  why wont it earn? MCC is still the same.,btohqsg
I thought so too but somewhere along the thread I read it wont be.. or perhaps I have misinterpreted,btohqsg
Thus would like to clarify on this,btohqsg
Yup  Amaze only changes transactions to online. MCC remains the same.,btohqsg
Double confirm did I heard Chris said that Maybank Family and Friend card does not work with Amaze anymore as it look at the description which consists the ‚ÄúAmaze‚Äù wording?,btohqsg
no. What he meant is for bonus categories that are merchant-specific e.g. popular bookstore under retail and pets category  merchant will be Amaze so no 8% at popular. Should use Maybank fnf card itself for these merchant-specific categories. Amaze+maybank fnf still work for those bonus categories that are based on MCC.,btohqsg
Trust Bank -> 2% for 75k (5 txn using debit card)Singlife -> 2% 10k (Need put in 500 and use to topup grab)ICBC 1 month FD -> 2.3% 75kGXS -> 3.48% 5kAs for the remaining Sum try incremental saving in these video:https://youtu.be/ETTE16S8VLwMost of these saving account are low risk and  try cap the saving amt at 75k for each accounts(SDIC),btohqsg
Why Singlife use to topup grab? Do they give rewards?,btohqsg

Anybody know the latest t bill rate?,btohqsg

Any idea how long does GxS approval take? Planning to move some of my money over (its a pool of savings for a dedicated purpose so abit funny to leave it with my own money in UOB One / OCBC 360),btohqsg
