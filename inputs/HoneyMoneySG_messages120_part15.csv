Hi all  I am looking for acard solely for grocery spend. I can only spend about $100 on groceries per month. I think for cashback  the citi 1.6% cashback card is the choiceBut for miles card  which miles card would be recommended for such a low $ spend? Thank you for any tips/advice!,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have residential address in SingaporeDo you guys have any solution?HSBC not allow company address,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have any Homestay in SgI work remote,btohqsg
you might want to stick to purely cashback card for now.Just being blunt and honest.you spend $100 groceries a month x 3 years = $3600no miles card can generate enough miles for your $3.6k spend before the miles expire for you to redeem anything meaningful,btohqsg
incorporate the spend with a cards that can earn miles on grocery spend among other general spend (like citirewards + amaze),btohqsg
another way is buy heymax grocery store vouchers. heymax miles dont expire,btohqsg
OP only wants to spend $100 though  also will take a long time to get enough to redeem for anything.,btohqsg
Has anyone RECENTLY opened JOINT savings account with FRIENDS?I would like to ask if bank ask questions like WHY are you opening joint savings accounts with non blood relatives?,btohqsg
A few years ago I opened one with non-blood relative. No question was asked though.,btohqsg
yeah that's before fujian gang saganow times are different... i never do recently but MIGHT do  so i thought i would ask first.,btohqsg
Any idea what‚Äôs happening with M44U?,btohqsg
i mean can just hold it there until next time he starts spending more then it will accumulate. as least it doesnt expire,btohqsg
May as well get cashback. Miles will devalue as well.,btohqsg
what‚Äôs the best way to exchange sgd for usd and put it in my bank acc?,btohqsg
do you have any investment accounts? usually they are cheaper than banks for doing FX transactions.,btohqsg
yea i do! recently used moomoo to exchange my sgd but was wondering if i could get better rates,btohqsg
Interactive Brokers. but best practice to have order transactions and not just use it as an FX machineüíπ Interactive Brokers:https://hmsg.link/ibkrüíπ IBSG Sign-uphttps://hmsg.link/ibsg,btohqsg
I have investment account   but how to transfer usd to bank account for free? Or is always with a fee.. Reason is I want to consolidate my usd  is too messy,btohqsg
USD from IBKR... IBKR is free.. but receiving bank will always charge USD10 (due to charge from Correspondent Bank),btohqsg
actually Interactive Brokers is a good place to hold your USD toorelatively safe and they pay decent interest on USD balances,btohqsg
is there any interest for SGD balances?,btohqsg
i would place USD with them. I won't place SGD with them.,btohqsg
If have quite huge amount of usd. Can buy us tbills in secondary market too.,btohqsg
what is the minimum size for USTs in IBKR?,btohqsg
JP Morgan is the intermediary bank for DBS in US. They will always jiak me $10usd when i transfer from IBKR to DBS MCA SG. Then SG side will deduct another 10sgd,btohqsg
oh wait.. by right... DBS should not makan you another SGD10,btohqsg
I always call DBS to waive. But they always act blur... say they dont know why JP Morgan US is taking 10usd for each transfer,btohqsg
USD10... is true.. they CANNOT waive.. nobody can.,btohqsg
the right charge is 10sgd by DBS MCA SG. not 10usd by JP Morgan US.,btohqsg
no.. the correct charge is USD10 by Correspondent Bank Jp Morgan.The SGD10 is DBS ownself want to makan you one,btohqsg
Are you DBS Treasures? From what I know  DBS Treasures dont need to pay 10sgd. The right charge is really 10sgd and not 10 usd by JP Morgan hahaI checked many times with those IBKR user in the IBKR group leh,btohqsg
let me rephrase..has anyone u heard of  whether IBKR group or here..manage to get the USD10 fee waived?,btohqsg
I got it waived each time the 10usd is charged by JP Morgan on top of the 10sgd charged by DBS SG (10sgd cannot waive). Or rather DBS SG credit me back 10usd  so net net i only pay 10sgd,btohqsg
Using IBKR SG to withdraw USD to DBS MyAccount USD  no 10 USD charge  only 10 SGD charge,btohqsg
yes this is the correct one,btohqsg
who does IBKR SG use to hold USD?,btohqsg
but did u check... if u transfer 5000usd out from IBKR  does 5000usd end up in DBS MCA? haha or 4990 usd come in only üòù,btohqsg
To be exact  7.40 USD is deducted (equivalent to 10 SGD),btohqsg
ok anyway my experience is no matter where transfer USD to where..there is always a USD10 fee by Correspondent Bank.Unless one of your accounts (Sender or Recipient) is an account with the Correspondent Bank  cannot waive the USD10 one. If refund or credit  is the RM/Cost Center of the Receiving Bank give you one.On the other hand  the SGD10 is a fee levied by DBS for receiving Foreign Currency in lieu of FX Exchange  which is a fee DBS wants to makan (means DBS can waive if they want to).,btohqsg
Why I say the USD10 cannot waive  is because it is charged by the correspondent bank  per wire  and they don't see who or how big the client is.They just charge USD10 per transaction.,btohqsg
i withdraw 5580usd from IBKR US,btohqsg
5570usd came in. JP Morgan US (DBS intermediary) makan 10usd and then DBS SG jiak another 7.35usd,btohqsg
yes CORRECT (from my experience).The USD10 auto deducted.. no way to waive (yes your DBS RM maybe can credit you back  but it is from DBS ownself give you one)  they cannot control JP Morgan AUTO DEDUCTION.The SGD10... haha.. i no comment.. i never get such deductions before.,btohqsg
Does ocbc global currency account charge 10& also? I recently opened in app haven't used.,btohqsg
Thanks  I have signed up for those brokers n gotten a few stocks less than 100 usd in tiger  moomoo. Wanted to sell n buy all in 1 broker.. Hmm  think cannot liao cause of the charge,btohqsg
Anyone knows if uob lady work well with amaze. Which category will amaze fall under?,btohqsg
