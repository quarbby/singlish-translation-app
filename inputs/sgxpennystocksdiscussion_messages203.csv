*NanoFilm Technologies International* *(NANO SP / BUY / TP: S$4.52)**Conference Call Takeaways; Expect Further Re-rating**Differentiated technology-based solutions opens up opportunity in new markets.* The FCVA technology opens up the possibility for usage of materials that have lower melting points such as metals  plastic and rubbers that are generally cheaper materials. As such  Nanofilm is able to metalise these materials and achieve some functionality and surface properties which are similar to metal. Furthermore  the technology provides FCVA with the ability to enter new markets such as personal grooming  new energy  5G  biomedical and aerospace industries that were previously inaccessible by conventional coating technologies.*Bigger wallet share and organic growth to drive revenue from the 3C market.*  We believe Nanofilm has gained market share in the smart phone segment. This is evident through the revenue growth from smart phone  within the advanced materials segment  (10.8% 2017-19 CAGR) that has outpaced that of customer Z‚Äôs (Nanofilm‚Äôs largest customer) smartphone sales (1.1% FY17-19 CAGR). We expect this trend to continue as we understand the group‚Äôs market share (% of total addressable market for surface solution for smart phones) is still relatively small. The group should also benefit from organic growth in the wearables & accessories market  which has a relative low penetration rate and is expanding rapidly.*Second plant in Shanghai to support growth.* The group has in the past  increased production capacity in tandem with revenue growth. Similarly  in order to provide additional production capacity to support the group‚Äôs push to gain market share for the next few years  Nanofilm is in the midst of constructing its second Shanghai plant. The plant  which is expected to be fully operational by end-21  will be able to house 200 more coating equipments which would potentially increase its total number of coating equipments by 2.6x from 122 as at 1H20  to up to 322 units.*Maintain BUY with higher target price of S$4.52* (previously S$4.07). We value NanoFilm based on a higher PEG of 1.0x (growth based on 3-year CAGR of 38.7%)  up from 0.9x  as we narrow the discount to peers‚Äô PEG from 25% to 17% given more analyst coverage and potential earnings upside from better-than-expected margins and new projects.  Our target price implies a 38.7x 2021F PE. We believe its unique technology  superior net margins and sole supplier status for most of its major customers provides a strong competitive advantage and warrants a premium to peers.,btohqsg
Bro VV3 if can hold. Will eventually hit 8 series one. Anything 68-72 is good EP.,btohqsg
My cost is 70  im picking up since it's on an uptrend and high possibility of going beyond 80 so im holding on.,btohqsg
Thanks Thomas  how about black gold?,btohqsg
Moya Holdings Asia posted a post-tax profit of S$11.9 million for Q3 2020  nearly three times the S$4.24 million earned in the corresponding quarter a year ago.,btohqsg

Cut ISDN 400. BBs tricky. I think now that some have sold  they might play up soon,btohqsg
Sentiment not good can cut first  can always re-enter to catch the upwards move,btohqsg
Since they might play up right?,btohqsg
Impatient. Aim other easier to play counters.,btohqsg
Looks like got played out by sitra a second time. Better not give any more chance? üò∞,btohqsg
Sitra i will not join in for life,btohqsg
Now my contra OEL cannot sell even i want go stop loss,btohqsg
Some people anyhow call and we lose money by following,btohqsg
I think 395 good price . I see buyers replenish this level,btohqsg
Hosen so nice  e eryday up up up  one day sure turbo,btohqsg
This one got inside sellers unfortunately. I have 1800 lots also now. ..,btohqsg
Yup. Most are 1 pip sell off. Long list....oel blackgold sitra v2y,btohqsg
Yea that‚Äôs why I think the ISDN BBs quite tough. Not easy,btohqsg
3c  sifu still have? 14  can jeep?,btohqsg
Unless you can hold for months,btohqsg
What will happen if contra counter cannot sell in time?,btohqsg
And you have no money to pay,btohqsg
Let say the share price now 0.017,btohqsg

Miyoshi so many buy q 33,btohqsg
May be miyoshi itself share buy back,btohqsg
hso let it go back down to 0.001/2 then load up to average out the buy at 0.007 üòÇ,btohqsg
Why not you sell now and buy back later at 0.002,btohqsg
Selling coming back again at MT,btohqsg
also can consider  just heart pain only,btohqsg
Contra has never been a good idea  highly risky. Sorry to say. Be safe pls. Buy what you can pick up if is good stock. üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt follow top spotter. By the time u get in  alr 1/2 pip higher   then they sell u. Once in a while will hv some that move la  but if I see the trend  it‚Äôs only maybe 1 in 10 call will continue moving. Best is you do your own research,btohqsg
HS Optimus (HSO) Added more 0.006.The previous gap up 0.006 to 0.008 can only be done by the BBs. Price drop to this level was expected due to the gap up. But not much real selling to get into back to the price before the gap up. highly likely the BBs doing a good flushing before they push up any further. Easily can go back to 0.008 level as shown previously.Buy this one need to hold. This price is reasonable as HSO is likely one of the more undervalued counters around.NAV : $0.012xCash : $17mHonestly  I do not see real distribution done at all and the sellers at 0.006 are likely retailers trying to cut. Not BBs distributing. If they wanted to distribute they would not have stack 90 000 lots at 0.009 and instead put 5000 lots there continuously to sell off to retailers.$0.006 is a buy in my opinion. Good luck to us holders,btohqsg
yesterday us counter also make me sad... pre market up 60% i hold out to see if it will go up more  by end of day  lower than entry price,btohqsg
Now this price is  very safe n if lost  will be due to bad timing,btohqsg
Sell now  buy back at 0.002 you will have 3x lot.,btohqsg
i q 7 to selll see if can done,btohqsg
Follow my own study and own call,btohqsg
One day shout 10 counters  one counter up and all say the spotter very zhun,btohqsg
Lucky my loss not alot for contra,btohqsg
They shout 10 only 2 will up. The rest will be gone case,btohqsg
And those that i follow gone case,btohqsg
Want sell also no one buy,btohqsg
thats how my warehouse got 30 counters now la... but it is my own decision to follow and also i set my own sl,btohqsg
The rest is they sell to you for 1 pip profits. Leave u holding the bag,btohqsg
market down all complain including myself,btohqsg
Next time they call sinjia I think  u short better!,btohqsg
LATER is the 1 that are long,btohqsg
My MT is hold for long so im not worry,btohqsg

cha cha  2 step forward 2 step back  2 step forward 3 step back,btohqsg
My friends and i arw moving to US,btohqsg
But cannot blame ppl. Is u believe u buy,btohqsg
Act today market weak ma.. so csnnot be expect counter up also lar,btohqsg
us market strong sg weak  us market weak sg weaker,btohqsg
Yup. Just hoping to let more people know they need to be wary of certain callers,btohqsg
Dax is actually ok. He don‚Äôt anyhow,btohqsg
The only counter i confident in long run is ifast and MT,btohqsg
The place and v2y going against trend,btohqsg

Avarga got good FA...not anyhow call one,btohqsg
The f up thing is OCBC platform don't have stoploss,btohqsg
Yea! For very long long term people,btohqsg
You made the right risk management decision. Spotters  chartists too are not gods. External situations can affect share price movements n you hv to be prompt to react appropriately unless you wish to pick up if they are good stocks with upside potential.,btohqsg
Hopefully this boss chan release some gd news soon. I hold alot on this n need to clear it,btohqsg
Boss chan will save share price ?,btohqsg
Tough market  sidelines and reduce counters this period is good. survive and fight another day,btohqsg
But we must appreciate their effort to share with us. It is up to us to dyodd to buy or sell. That is my view lah. I too hv my warehouse of stocks caught when situation changed. üòÜ,btohqsg
tiger got  but also dumb cos if u key sl u cant key tp order,btohqsg

This one pump and dump daily across a period. Unless you catch a good wind  if not you will get stuck. At this price I would say it is good entry. But movement might not come until weeks if not months. Rotational play is needed here... if not everyday will drop a few pips due to small queues.,btohqsg
