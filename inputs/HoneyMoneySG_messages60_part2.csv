Any road warriors here? Where is the best flight search engine now for multileg flights? I have stopped flying for work for more than 10 years dunno what ppl use now,btohqsg
This is correct. From DBS  Salary Payment via FAST works. Did that yesterday.,btohqsg
does it work for OCBC 365 account for 4.6% interest?,btohqsg
And what bank accounts are they?,btohqsg
No  ocbc only recognises giro or corporate paynow giro,btohqsg
U want to know which bank? DBS,btohqsg
You mean OCBC 360 account? I don't think so since they specifically stated GIRO or PayNow via GIRO (which is under PayNow corporate). But you can see if anyone can confirm that they have tried here,btohqsg
And what bank accounts are they????? DBS/POSB have so many accounts available,btohqsg
Only trick I know if you can topup to YouTrip to extend validity if you can't finish using it before it expires,btohqsg
As i undetstand fm staff dbs/posb saving have same method of calculating intetest pymt but for dbs mca acc diff method therefore even have more fund did not rec interest,btohqsg

So for the UOB one account  if I open account and transfer in 100K with 1.6K as SALA transaction on day 1  i get EIR of 5% right away?,btohqsg
I tried that. Didn't work for me. Called up UOB and they said the salary must be from HR dept of your company.I have also tried FAST. Also cannot :((Bottomline...must originate from a company.If anyone has tried and succeed  please kindly share your details of how you did it to earn the interest. Would really love to get the 5%,btohqsg
"You tried to FAST from DBS and select ""Salary Payment"" as purpose of transfer?",btohqsg
Hello all you all want to try any tricks to exploit any loophole  be happy if it works. if it didn't work don't go and call the bank and ask why your trick to exploit loophole did not work. oh. my. god.,btohqsg

I already have a CC with UOB and spending $500 per month no issue to satisfy this criteria. question is if I open the account middle of the month  will the counting starts for my CC spend from 1st of month or from time I opened the account?,btohqsg
This 1 u can call UOB n ask,btohqsg
I call uob to ask and they told me it‚Äôs start from first month start spending can alr. But I do see some member ever mentioned it‚Äôs when u open the account,btohqsg
It's calendar month if I remember correctly,btohqsg
I opened my uob one 7th. They took my spending my cc from 1st,btohqsg
Means you didn't put the correct transaction category,btohqsg
Already spoon-feed many. Unfortunately some want to be spoon-fed with a fork,btohqsg
Is it because when new people join they can't search the previous messages before they joined?,btohqsg
U definitely need to train your common sense and critical thinking.,btohqsg
Cannot be. Because when I first joined I was able to search everything üôÉ,btohqsg

Hi  sorry if this qn has been asked before.I current credit my salary to my ocbc 360  but I want to transfer most of my money in this acc to to uob one (in view of the uob national savings promotion).If my ocbc 360 acc has 10k remaining after the transfer of money to uob  does this mean I will only receive minimal interest in ocbc 360  despite crediting my salary into the acc (as there is no increment of $500 for daily balance as a result of my transfer of cash out of the acc)?,btohqsg
u get 3.1% on your MAB,btohqsg
how do we PayNow Salary credit  can guide?,btohqsg
As of when you deposit $ to your uob one  not from 1st,btohqsg
Is it National saving promo $58 ?,btohqsg

Ah OK got it  thank you!,btohqsg
I'm refering to the cc spend criteria  not the deposit of Salary or fresh funds.,btohqsg
Seriously  why do you guys even want to call the bank? What do u want them to reply? ‚ÄúYes  this is a loophole  pls exploit it‚Äù? The tmrw app has an indicator to show whether u meet the salary crediting criteria. Just paynow to yourself  wait a few days and see if the indicator changes for you. No need to call them.,btohqsg
I'll manually typePaynow got some banks allow you to select transaction categoryYou have to select the category as salaryAnd the description put SALADisclaimer: haven't tried the paynow method myself because I use fast,btohqsg
