🎉Pika World Update – 6 July 2022🎉💰Reverse the losses💎The equity market had a tough start as significant indices fell sharply only to reverse the losses in the later session. It was a mixed day given a dual concern of inflation and recession. In addition  the US Treasury market saw a yield fall  offering Nasdaq much-needed support.⏳Old names shine again🔦As yield fell  growth stocks had some shine on them again. This is likely to be much needed after major shares had fallen hard during this winter. Yet as the earnings arrived  much was focused on what the management felt about the 2H earnings.🎙Earnings on highlight💵As the parade of earnings swarms into the market  companies will have to show investors how they are coping with inflation and the insights of a shift in consumer spending given the still supply constraint we have seen. This means guidance is more essential and the commentary on their outlook of 2022.The general consensus is for S&P 500 to register a decent revenue growth of 10.4% compared to last year's period. However  while the change is commendable  investors are wary that earnings per share growth are starting to wane as profit margins are expected to be weak.📠What’s on the menu today?📪Today  we will receive some JOLTs Job openings data and ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI. Then the FOMC minutes will arrive  which is critical for us to understand if the Fed is increasingly more hawkish and aggressive in its monetary tightening.Pika Nat had taken some short positions today  which we have cut loss. It has been a difficult trading period  and we have tried to preserve our capital and cut loss more decisive when the tide turns. It can be demoralizing but following the trading plan is ever more critical.It is 6 July 2022  Wednesday  4.25 am in Singapore and 4.25 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a good week ahead!,btohqsg
