If by 28 years old you can clear your loan  Go for it. Your income will continue to grow as you gain more experience along your career. You won‚Äôt stuck forever in $4k-$5k. However. If you are working without degree in a corporate world  I can‚Äôt comment on your income. Need other to comment.,btohqsg
Hi Queenie  thanks for replying  3%/3mpdand above for Cashback  miles,btohqsg
Process offline is okay as still counted for $600 min spent,btohqsg
Why you need to compare to other people?,btohqsg
Hi  is the gxs saving account still available for registration?,btohqsg
Slot full at the momentJust go apply and wait,btohqsg
If not can try apply MariBank,btohqsg
As long as you lead a happy life  why compare? If your pay is higher  it‚Äôs likely your work life is much more stressful too,btohqsg
Better not be hoodwinked by tiktok and youtube  most people do not even have 100k by the time they retire let alone by 30!,btohqsg
degree is always great to have  but not mandatory imo,btohqsg
dont worry  every one has their own timeline  one can have 100K by 30 but at 50 only 300K  but another can have 10K by 30 but 1M by 50. so dont worry too much  everyone has their own timeline :),btohqsg
Saw the advert on cimb 3.5%. Seems the best savings so far after hsbc ega nerf?,btohqsg
for fuss free  CIMB Fastsaver is a good choice with GxS. Furthermore  now new changes  CIMB Fastsaver also benefit for existing user,btohqsg
This example is US though  not SG,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry  I got a degree and I‚Äôm 29 now with portfolio of 100k and paid off my degree loan. Currently I‚Äôm taking my masters which costs 50k. Education is really important in Singapore to be able to climb the corporate ladder.,btohqsg
old cimb don't have benefit ?,btohqsg
Well done bro can you share how to amass more portfolio now? I wanna start saving.,btohqsg
Tbh the easiest way now is to start saving more and invest in safe etfs/stocks. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently doing. Also as much as possible try to minimise spending and put ur money in those high interest accounts like UOB one which I‚Äôm currently doing. Having 100k in will yield around $420 in interest every month  which also offsets ur spending. But at the same time I guess I‚Äôm quite lucky as I‚Äôm currently still staying with my parents so I don‚Äôt have to deal with any rental expenditures except for the allowance I give them,btohqsg
Yes  deg is essential  esp if u wanna go into technical field like engineering. Its not too late to start investing at 28 and there's no need to benchmark urself to others as long as u r financially prudent and learn to invest rite (low cost  diversified),btohqsg
Tink of a degree as an investment,btohqsg
Good question. I shall endeavor to answer it simply.Usually it will be a good idea to work for maybe 3 years after NS and see whether the field is suitable for you. Some fields do have a different feel working from studying  even with that internship you completed back in Poly. If you‚Äôre confident you can excel in the field and need to delve deeper  then after two years of work or maybe three  you are more likely to incur a smaller study loan  have the work experience that enrich your academic study experience  and value add to your fellow school mates.Also  if you ever consider moving overseas for further opportunities (which you might to even enhance your career)  they look at work experience at a global benchmark. My experience is some countries would rather take five years of technical Poly level work than three years of Uni experience  and all these qualifications up to a age sliding scale‚Ä¶,btohqsg

How do i invest into T-bills from dbs online banking,btohqsg
Since HSBC EGA no longer has bonus interest  anyone considering to terminate the account? Otherwise HSBC keeps charging the $5 for fall below fee.,btohqsg
just keep 0 balance in the account,btohqsg
I will put 0 shortly after I collected the bonus interest in Aug.,btohqsg
Im sorry may i know because im already had a CIMB fast Saver account last year . could i be able to open a Star Saver account to earn that 3.5% interest?,btohqsg
Or just put 2k to avoid the $5 fall below fee,btohqsg
The promo is extended to existing customer as well right?,btohqsg
"""Open a CIMB Savings account online to earn 3.5%*p.a. interest from your first dollar! Limited time promo by 31 July 2023 and fornew-to-CIMB customers only.""",btohqsg
What if next time I transfer money into that account ?,btohqsg

So is available for existing customers as well . Thanks üôèüèº,btohqsg
looks like for existing customer - it's only incremental monthly balance,btohqsg
1.5% from first dollar + 2% on incrementals,btohqsg
3.50% p.a. on their incremental fresh funds balance for the first 6 calendar months starting from 1 Aug '23 to 31 Jan '24. if one has low funds on July also can,btohqsg
So what it mean is that if my CIMB July balance is 0 . Once I put in 50k into it I will be able to earn 3.5% interest for the next 6 months? Am I right ?,btohqsg
