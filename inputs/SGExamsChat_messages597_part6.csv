something you shouldn't have asked a railfan about ðŸ˜ŽKHI/C151: unique features abt it: one of the only trains to feature a black rain gutter (look above at where the doors are 'attached to' if you are lucky u wld be able to see rain rushing from the sides into the gangway area. the front is also another defining feature as it has a flat front unlike the other trains that has a curved frontSIE/C651: this is basically almost how the aforementioned train looked like when it first arrived in singapore  with a few differences. Key feature include 9 in a row seating  and that 'old looking interior'KNS/C751B: Fun fact: this train was meant to be an 'airport express' where you could ride on the very same train from Boon Lay (former terminus of East West line) all the way till changi airport on the very same train  this idea was scrapped later on tho  also this train used to have luggage racks but it was removed later and now is an area for wheelchair bound people. One defining feature is that it has a curved front  with a black front  and it's lights make the interior look slightly beige in colour.KSFA/C151A: imma breeze through them since i hate them :D  for KSFA it looks similar to KNS  but the black front looks more like a smiley curve whereas for KNS it's flat at the bottom of the black front. Also interior looks q newKSFB/C151B: Can be easily distinguished by its SMRT pixel livery (the yellow red and black livery)  also first train on NSEWL to feature STARIS 2.0? where the route map information was displayed on a screen rather than a board.KSFC/C151C: This train was supposed to be revolutionary with its tip up seats (more seating space during off peak and more standing space during peak)  however they no longer use this function and always keep it down. interior looks pretty much the same as KSFB  external livery is black top and white bottom  with a red and green stripe in between.R151/ALS R: also known as Alien ðŸ™„  this is another train that has the LTA logo at the front  like the KSFC  it's the train where the STARIS is wide and flush  unlike the previous versions  imo i prefer this  also has a similar livery to KSFC except that at doors the black part becomes 'wider/taller'  also this is the train where the window doesn't have the pillar in the middle,btohqsg
note that this is just like the tip of the iceberg  there are many more defining features for each train,btohqsg
