Maybe he can start with all your 10 cars!,btohqsg
Yeah this is better also. If the publicity turn out to be very beneficial. Dealers may fight for slots for the free advert haha,btohqsg
Sold to make way for bugaboo,btohqsg
If u know what I mean haha,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not the one with 10 cars hahaha,btohqsg
Haha sgcm looking for dealers willing to lent their inventory for shoot,btohqsg
Or is it the other m3 owner that had lunch at my place?,btohqsg
Of course sir. I just grew out of one 5 years ago,btohqsg
Hahaha not that la. Was referring to the McLaren stroller hahahaha. Not having anymore kids. Factory closed!,btohqsg
I am currently not holding enough for them to shoot tho,btohqsg
Haha havenâ€™t been there for ages. But it wasnâ€™t me,btohqsg
Why so many m3 owners go your place one?,btohqsg
Tho drop me a dm on the types if you all require maybe i can put you in touch with a dealer with one,btohqsg
Short uncle drive m3?! He can reach the pedal plus look over the steering wheel or not,btohqsg
So cute can only see his head from the window,btohqsg
Actually m3 is made for shorter people. The brake pedal is tiny af,btohqsg
Or because m3 donâ€™t need brakes,btohqsg
Small nvm  as long can use,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not that. They have nothing to prove. Pedal small so easy and nimble to step,btohqsg
Cos m3 slow la hahah. Take forever to build rpm,btohqsg
Launch every time you stop! Hahaha ðŸš€,btohqsg
Now so bright  everyone will know itâ€™s me,btohqsg
For one  need more in-depth information on cars. Example  back then I wanted to know whether cars come with sunroof or not but seems like itâ€™s not a talking point  unless itâ€™s high end stuff like Harrierâ€™s panoramic roof with dimming.Think when you talk about leg room and headroom of interior  should have rough measurement or something. Some people might have shorter torso and longer body but still have same height as the speaker.Then for example the recent M3 video  not much was talked about in regards to interior storage compartment like glove box and Center consoleAlso claim FC usually abit off from actual FC  should have actual driving FC leh. My A4 MHybrid claims to have 16km/l but Iâ€™m usually hitting around 10-11km/l,btohqsg
Oh IS THIS THE IM 1.6m tal and i fit just nice in the backseat? Haha,btohqsg
HAHAHA ya like my wife hor also around that height but sheâ€™s like why the legroom not as advertised ah  not very comfy,btohqsg
Then when I open my A4 glovebox I realise itâ€™s a tiny compartment taken up mostly by an already outdated cd player. Like hello 2021 why you still here,btohqsg
honestly so far the car reviews are great but Iâ€™m seeing alot high end performance car rather than Cat A cars. Mostly its been cat B and cat B and cat B. Hopefully more videos on used cars because thats where most of us are buying the cars from.I think maybe better video angles on dashboard would be nice  cus most of the time Iâ€™m seeing it from the side  would be nice to see it from the driver perspective. Maybe wear helmet camera or go pro to zoom in at some features relating to the car?If can open bonnet to have a quick view would be nice  like 6 sec shot then saying the bhp and how much torque it can produce.,btohqsg
Hais if only BMW got 3 series in the style of M3 touring,btohqsg
I dun like the touring leh,btohqsg
Wa shit i nearly bang someone  at night wear all black bike no lights zz,btohqsg
I like station-wagon style sia plus that rear window can open up. Tempted to just downgrade to A4 Avant B9 sia  got no upgraded MMI but still worth the practicality,btohqsg
But the back especially the diffuser is ugly,btohqsg
Wai Wai Wai  I like leh,btohqsg
But either way most people will mod it anyway  maybe can put those hexagon exhaust in the middle type one,btohqsg
When I saw it  it reminded me of lancalution exhaust diffuser cut outs,btohqsg
Honestly wish they design that better,btohqsg
But I would still buy it la  if I had the money,btohqsg
Hello pulis. Coz you typing away on sgcm sima?,btohqsg

Important is its luckily an easy fix. One day job.,btohqsg
Cannot la actually my insurance already Sky high,btohqsg
If hit then I think no insurance wanna insure me already,btohqsg
Today got a couple of idiots that I can purposely bang them for swerving into my lane but I give way let them go,btohqsg
