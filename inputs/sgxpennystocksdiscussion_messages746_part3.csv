"🎉Pika World Daily Review – 21 December 2022🎉🧸A tiny rebound that lacks strength🎲The equity market rebounded on Tuesday as investors shrugged off the surprising decision by the Bank of Japan to expand the yield control band. However  the stock market remained somewhat muted throughout the session  and Nasdaq swung between losses and gains.Higher rates are a headwind for stocks  and with Bank of Japan's latest move  it signals that borrowing cost is likely to rise worldwide as most central banks appear to have a coordinated action. It is significant because it was seen as the bastion of easy monetary policy  and some labelled it as ""Japan's pivot"" in its latest decision.The SPY appeared to find strength at 381 as it tried to recover lost ground. While we see further robust support at around 374-376 regions  we remain cautious in a challenging macro environment  especially when we have more upcoming economic data.🧮FedEx hinting at a softer economy🗽Investors eyeing a splendid result from FedEx have reasons for disappointment. Unfortunately  the latest earnings continued to be hammered by a weaker economy and diminishing volumes.Some say logistics is the economy's heartbeat  and money is the blood in the veins of capitalism. FedEx is indisputably one of the better barometers of the global economy's health. Let's dive into some quick results.Based on a yearly comparison  volumes dived about 12% for domestic and international express daily packages. While volume had decreased  it is mitigated by higher pricing  and thus  operating profit margins remain healthy as it improves by around 7% on a year-over-year comparison.The earnings are strong  but earnings guidance is light. Earnings per share are expected to hit around $13 to $14  but Wall Street expects a firm baseline of $14 per share.Although the results were less severe than anticipated  it could still be the onset of corporate earnings recession to come.💎Nike:Just Do it (again)📊Shares of the athletics products giant jumped after it smashed quarterly earnings and revenue  although margins are tighter to cope with higher costs. Inventories did rise on a yearly comparison but zooming into a quarterly analysis shows a decline. Thus  it does hint at some underlying improvement.Notably  digital sales are healthy too. However  its sales in China  which is its third-largest market by revenue  fell 3% compared to a year ago. This is unsurprising  given the strict Covid-19 restrictions in China that have dampened consumerism.Pika World continues to favour Nike's strategy of becoming a direct-to-consumer brand by improving its digital sales flavour to its global consumers.📮What's on the menu today?📖At 11 pm  we will welcome CB Consumer Confidence for Dec. Do expect a moderate rise to 101.0 from 100.2.Existing home sales for Nov will arrive simultaneously and should soften to 4.2M from 4.43M.It is 21 December  Wednesday  at 9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. We see some bottoming signs in the market  but with more economic data surfacing  it can soon prove to be a sea of turbulence. Pika World wishes all friends a fruitful day ahead!",btohqsg
