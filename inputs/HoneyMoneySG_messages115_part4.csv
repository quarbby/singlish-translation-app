Hey guys  am going to Japan soon and was wondering what the best card to use would be? My current understanding is that VISA is not as widely accepted in Japan compared to MC. Right now  I believe that Youtrip would be the best for card payments and also ATM withdrawals. Trust would then be a backup provided I find VISA supported ATMs. Is this true?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
but of course u may encounter banks that are not happy that you are just using them as a conduit to receive and immediately transfer out funds.. then u will get the account closure letter.,btohqsg
Not true that visa not wide accepted,btohqsg
Visa=Master. Amex is also almost equally well accepted.. just a FEW shops i saw accept visa/master but not amex,btohqsg
Dont reply to me. Lol reply to op. I been using card whenever i travel to japan.,btohqsg
May I know what card you use in Japan?,btohqsg
I use different range  uob evol  ocbc frank  amaze with maybank fnf(for your bonus cat) for cashback. Amaze with crmc  uob ppv  uob vs for miles,btohqsg
