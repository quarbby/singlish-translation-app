These categories won't be covered by 1 single category of UOB lady. I'd suggest citi Rewards for anything online then Citi rewards + instarem amaze for offline spends.,btohqsg

its been awhile since i hold a SC card. First i rmb it took awhile for approval. And I recall they didnt have digital card back then.,btohqsg
My experience when i applied scb smart is that they offered digital card but the options is via temp access id/pw or your cc details. The temp access id+pw need to go down to their branch to get it. Because i am new to scb i got no other cards to login and lazy to go down to their branch. I have to wait for the new card to mailed to me first.,btohqsg

Hi  for those who have used CardUps  can I ask for your opinions?I was calculating to see if it is worth to use CardUp if it was @2.6%Eg. A spending of $10 000Charges for CardUp is 2.6% ($260)If i use a miles card with $1 to 1.4miles  I will get about 14 364 milesSo technically I am spending $260 for 14 364 miles?Did I get this right?So if let‚Äôs say a round trip to Korea - 54k miles  I will need to ‚Äúspend‚Äù $977 on CardUp charges to get a round trip?If this is the case  it is not really ‚Äúworth it‚Äù right? Since booking for flights using miles won‚Äôt be that easy  depends on luck and period.Thankyou! (=,btohqsg

Cardup is just buying miles at a fee (which may/may not be reasonable to use). Best is to utilise sign-up offers or big purchases at 4 mpd split across various cards,btohqsg
