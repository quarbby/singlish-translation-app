Hi community from my understanding of Amaze + CRMC  you can convert a transaction into an online one provided it's not a excluded MCC hence  I can use this combination for payment of Netflix  YouTube and Spotify? üôèOr can I just directly pay using CRMC since by logic these are online payment..,btohqsg
Hi gurus is it true that if use 3rd party like ShopBack/ atome that you will not receive the 4MPD (assuming eligible mcc) on CRMC because payment is split up?,btohqsg
unless you're scared that you kena DCC charge  then route through Amaze,btohqsg
These may be recurring payment instead of online payment. Think better to use Amaze+CRMC.,btohqsg
Ok well noted thank youTrazoraand@adam_93for your time,btohqsg
Hi gurus for paying prudential insurance  best to do citypayall or just direct ipay? With CRMC,btohqsg
Anyone knows when does UOB announce new promos about its credit cards?Want to apply for UOB credit card as a new to UOB member  but looks like I‚Äôm near the Promo ending date  and they can just exclude me from qualifying the $300 bonus by approving the card only in the next month.https://www.uob.com.sg/credit-cards/pdf/online-cards-campaign.pdf?i_cid=pfs:sg:owned:int:site:na:li:na:na:na-evergreen:direct:na&vid=none,btohqsg

How to get GXS? Seems like need invite but not sure how they will send the invite. What other option if have >20k?,btohqsg
Hahaha I got it through Grab app  dk if you can try that.,btohqsg
If your Grab middle section on bottom row becomes ‚ÄúFinance‚Äù then you just tap on it and see how lor,btohqsg
More than 20k without salary I don't think there's much options leh? I might be wrong.,btohqsg
Ohhh okay  will still browse through banks first as still schooling,btohqsg
Trust can be another option  1.5%-2.5% up to $75k iirc,btohqsg
If want I can send referral  get free 1 litre oil  $10 FP voucher and $25 FP voucher (when make one visa transaction) now,btohqsg

How to clock until so high?,btohqsg
Do u know whether this is true.Since reference month is in Jan  if account is open in Feb  wont be eligible for the promo?,btohqsg
I think you are supposed to open HSBC EGA account in Jan  put 2k inside. Then from Feb  you put e.g. 50k. The incremental balance from Jan (i.e. 48k) will be given 4.55%  till May 2023.If i understand the promo correctly,btohqsg
eligible. Jan balance $0 if account open in Feb.,btohqsg
no need open 1 month earlier before depositing balance. Assuming new promo start in Mar  can open in Feb (ending soon anyway) and register and deposit balance in Mar  but not sure if the bonus interest will be higher or lower.,btohqsg
If I use citi payall (citi rewards cc) to pay my electrical bill  eg 300  to earn points I will incure the 2% fee which is $6300 reward points = 120 milesDoes that mean I bought my miles at $2.55 (306/120) per mile?,btohqsg
I applied for this late Jan together with hsbc revo credit card. My application still not approved  called them and nobody seems to know anything. Never experienced such along waiting time before with any other bank. How long did it take for them to approve yours?,btohqsg
I applied the acct at branch .. immediately get acct no..cc I already have,btohqsg
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Seems like their online application got issue?,btohqsg
Wanted to apply online as I already have their online banking..but unable to..so went to the branch.i did asked the staff there .seem that acct can only open at branch..,btohqsg
EGA Approved immediately during CNY day 1 üòÖ revo card approved 3 days later,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure might have to check else HSBC revo is a safer bet Edited: a quick search on hardware zone  people saying yes you do earn 3mpd,btohqsg
Huh why like that one ü§î. Only bank that was that fast for me was dbs,btohqsg
I applied online and got instant approval. But cc application took about 2 weeks,btohqsg
I use singpass to apply  idk maybe a lot people apply during their EGA promo ? üòÖ there are a lot of people who applied before me still waiting for account opening and their cc still not approved.I was expecting to be slow too  due to CNY period and a lot of application for their promo,btohqsg
For those who recently spin webull lucky wheel  could you share the screenshots of what you have won? Curious to know,btohqsg
Yeah I used Singpass as well to apply  hopefully they will approve soon,btohqsg
No  you bought your mile at 5 cents per mile6/120You were already going to pay for the $300  the difference is that in order to earn those miles you‚Äôd be paying the extra $6You can then decide whether the valuation of 5 cents per mile is appropriate for your miles gameA good deal for me is 1.5 cents to 2 centsTo each his own,btohqsg
just to confirm u applied online right? maybe ur credit v good haha. I just applied on Sun and called in this morning. I wonder if it can be done before wed,btohqsg
What card are u using btw  the miles are v little considering,btohqsg
Shouldn‚Äôt it be 1200 miles? For ur calculation,btohqsg
Electrical bills do not earn points but they have this citi payall function where you can earn 1 reward point / dollar if you pay a 2% fee,btohqsg
Can the shares that we get on webull be sold immediately and withdraw cash after it's cleared ?,btohqsg
Oh yea I forgot that Citi payall is only worth it during promotions,btohqsg
morning folks~ anyone know which credit card is good for Shell petrol?,btohqsg
