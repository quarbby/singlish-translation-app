For osome  are there any recurring annual fees for incorporation and corporate secretary? Also is there a renewal fee for pte ltd?,btohqsg
PTE LTD no need renewal  but need to file annual returns yearly after each financial year end,btohqsg
Thank you. Any recurring fees involved post-incorporation?My understanding is it costs around 600+ for incorporation and corporate secretary.  Is corporate secretary a recurring cost or one-time?,btohqsg
SC unlimited advantage is their Cashback will be credited to ur next statement  even if it's <$1,btohqsg
Incorporation is one time.Corp Sep is annual recurring,btohqsg
hi! just started working full time for 4 months  mostly spend on food  physical shopping  gym membership and part time uni school fees. have an existing one account  so was thinking of doing a UOB One + HSBC Revo + UOB Absolute cashback ( for school fees). Would this be a good strategy for someone who just started working?,btohqsg
Thank for clarifying! with the affiliate code you provided  do you know how much is the cost for incorporation and basic corporate secretary (1 year). They don't provide the details on the landing page and wanted to get a sense before getting in contact with them haha,btohqsg
For statutory fees  no recurring fees involved post incorporation except for annual returns for PTE LTD  but has secretary / CSP fees. Incorporation fees $315 but secretary fees depends on each secretary / CSP,btohqsg
Should be $315 (Charged by ACRA) + $252 (Essential secretary 1 year),btohqsg
Ah okay  so the incorporation is exactly 'free' like they put on their website? Haha,btohqsg

Hi I have a question regarding UOB giroRecently I applied via UOB internet banking for my UOB EVOL and UOB ONE card and it was approved.Today is the due date for my payment. Will they auto deduct the amount used for me or how does it work?,btohqsg
it may not be so fast. i monitored my account which had giro arrangement approved 10 days ago but on due date nothing changed  so i transferred money in just in case. the notification of arrangement said it would take up to 30 days to take effect,btohqsg
If your evol and one card statement does not mention giro. Then it’s not in effect yet.,btohqsg
