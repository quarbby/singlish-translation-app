Or at least an M2 lah,btohqsg
It is very controllable in an oversteer situation. Unfortunately for people who haven't had any time to practice on a track  once the rear wheels slide they start to get scared  over-correct and it spins the car. Best to sign up for those skid pan or track days to get some real practice in an understeer/oversteer situation. Now cannot lah  no travel allowed and no tracks in Singapore to practice.,btohqsg
Most newbies will accelerate  spin the rear wheels  the car starts to oversteer and then they panic so they countersteer. Due to the chassis stiffness  the car will snap back in the opposite direction; if you're not prepared for this  sure spin one. That's why it's easy to see who is a newbie vs those experienced drivers who have really driven on track before.,btohqsg
Most drivers in SG buy performance cars but they drive like crap. Wasted performance,btohqsg
Yes  isn't better online nowadays? I only go to a physical shop when I really need it very urgently. Otherwise can do it in the comfort of my sofa/bed in my boxers  watch the YouTube reviews  slowly compare prices and then buy. If the item is in SG  usually arrives in 1-2 days (Amazon/ Shopee),btohqsg
Yeah Rose bot  get rid of those annoying spammers. There's a special place in hell reserved for those spammers. In between Hitler and lawyers.,btohqsg
How is the scamming business going?,btohqsg
Then anything wrong  those online shop will never response to you,btohqsg
They also not tell u where is the service center,btohqsg
If delivery man happy  they will keep it for a while  while u eager to receive it,btohqsg
Reputable ones. Prices might be slightly higher but still worth it.,btohqsg
I paid much higher price than usual one  still suck  trust me  I spend lot on online shopping,btohqsg
I have never had this problem....I bought stuff in the thousands online before. Where did you buy from?,btohqsg
Q10 is the worst  Shopee better,btohqsg
"I never buy from Qoo10 or Wish a.k.a. ""I wish my stuff would come.""",btohqsg
I think if you stick to local retailers the reliability is very high. Amazon is also very good. I bought some shoes from US. They delivered  wrong size. I asked them to change. They got DHL to pick up,btohqsg
Also online price maybe higher than physical stores,btohqsg
That's why you need to shop around...compare prices,btohqsg
I find Amazon SG usually the most expensive but the delivery damn fast,btohqsg
Sometimes faster than for me to shower put on makeup take bus and go shop to buyüòÇ,btohqsg
Lazada delivery pretty slow  I dont know whether they change or not,btohqsg
Really? Normally Shopee take 4 days  Lazada take 7 days,btohqsg
OK lah maybe a bit of an overstatement,btohqsg
I find Shopee is not consistent...some online shops very fast some not that fast,btohqsg
yes  depend on your luckiness  Q10 is the worst,btohqsg
Thats why they deserve to die and burn in hell..no way you can do these stunts here..small brain young boys can spin and drift all they want in hell...deserve it,btohqsg
Fr the beauty u have u are always lucky‚ò∫üëç,btohqsg
