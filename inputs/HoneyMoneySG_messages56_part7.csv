Hi  I would like to know which credit card is the best for earning more miles when purchasing SIA tickets.,btohqsg
If you can hit all the the condition to make interest go >3.48 then yes max ocbc first,btohqsg
Don't think so  the table chart in CIMB promo website doesn't indicate existing customer but did put new-bank-customers,btohqsg
sorry  I didn't notice the mention of existing customers. if not mistaken  existing customers only receive 2.5%,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 or CIMB saving acc interest is better?,btohqsg
if u can hit the requirements for ocbc 360  it'll be better. but if you can't  then cimb is better since u only need min 1k (non-withdrawal),btohqsg
does uob lady 6mpd cap follows statement month or calendar month?,btohqsg
Are there any signup referrals for GXS?,btohqsg
Is gxs interest rate better than UOB one ?,btohqsg
depends on amount and whether you can fulfil UOB criteria. UOB can get 5% for 100K,btohqsg
UOB KF uncapped 3mpd earning for buying SIA/scoot plus unlocked 3mpd for other categories,btohqsg
Uob 5% stash acct for 100k? Or must be less than 100k?,btohqsg
No one look at stashaway. Also no frills. Put money in and earn 3.5%. Better than 3.48 GXS.did I miss out anything?,btohqsg
SA 3.5% is projected. Gxs is guranteed,btohqsg
SA has been underwhelming so far,btohqsg
uob one 100k + meet criteria 5%. Stash Account 3% only if meet criteria,btohqsg
