Even race karts  your weight also important,btohqsg

Excited to see a ttrs la,btohqsg

Sometimes we stay beside each other same speed and cruise tgt. Sometimes they just poke me or even hazard light me.,btohqsg
Dun chase fit can liao priss😂😂😂,btohqsg
if i see green led behind i chase haahah,btohqsg
Hazard light can mean other meaning too la,btohqsg
Cut lane liao.hazard 2times...mean thank on Japan roads,btohqsg
Yea i know. But it's v obvious what it means when they poke u then hazard on a express man. HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Unless come dammed close to my rear n high beam for extended distance,btohqsg
Then maybe see my mood..might test whether my ivtec working anot,btohqsg
my stupid mirror dun have the flick to direct highbeam away,btohqsg
The most epic one I encounter was the damn proton omg.,btohqsg
haha not push to race ah,btohqsg
Lose me then went missing. HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Push to race...speed at almost 150...got time press hazard light meh😂,btohqsg
The one that pushed me to race first poked me behind. Then after that zoom away. Then when we exited express  we stop side by side at traffic. He from there poke me and hazard me for at least 2 traffic lights.,btohqsg
hahaha 150 hazard means TP in front,btohqsg
Half way there to classic status,btohqsg
Your car look pokable... Until you show hand then they regret,btohqsg
Show the power of the Audi ttrs with his right foot,btohqsg
That day when going back from the wash  got one red Merc following very close behind me but I just casually driving home,btohqsg
Becoz of ur shiny paintwork n red H emblem😂,btohqsg

bucket comfortable for daily drive sir,btohqsg
own r34 is really dream until cannot dream,btohqsg
must see if you keeping the A6 for long,btohqsg
i still think changing to the 370z is an interesting option for me,btohqsg
but at the same time doesn't make sense,btohqsg
fairlady wont make sense due to our road tax,btohqsg
It's a slow car at a heavy price,btohqsg
the new Z at 3L turbo makes sense,btohqsg
since lower road tax with plenty of power,btohqsg
bro this one is different price range,btohqsg
it's essentially the same chassis too,btohqsg
Higher price tag but you save on rod tax n insurance,btohqsg
On a long run..you save more so its a fair trade off,btohqsg
not shitting on the S2K  but it is showing it's age,btohqsg
The newest MX5 with 2L engine can be faster than S2K,btohqsg
cos S2K before vtec wont have torque. Only play high end,btohqsg
ah isee. idk but i find that i sit straighter on bucket.,btohqsg
Wah u purposely wan tempt me.,btohqsg
s2k is higher then fd2r all that,btohqsg
MX5 not driven by God Hand lol.... So its not legendary,btohqsg
That's why buy a miata. HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
I'm still young so I'm in between. HAHAHA.,btohqsg
No sia  is cos i scared bang my exos,btohqsg
i geh kiang go put those taobao exhaust tips,btohqsg
all kena scratched out by the blocks alr,btohqsg
Sigh. I'd love for a mx5. But i dont think it suits my daily needs. I'll pass for mx5.,btohqsg
Nope. Too smol still. Boot space not enough,btohqsg
Euro S or FD2M  or a vios.,btohqsg
I think go round n round  my civic best.,btohqsg
If not I'll defi go for fd2r.,btohqsg
went to view  didn't like it,btohqsg
I know. HAHAH they can be pretty fucked.,btohqsg
sry ah no euro s here hor,btohqsg
I've seen this 200sx at sgcarmart with R34 taillights,btohqsg
@ANBU_ARASANwants to get the euro s manual next,btohqsg
I am the kind that want a IS250 in manual,btohqsg
We shall follow@ANBU_ARASANgo view the auro s. Hahaha,btohqsg
Hahaha...Nowadays also hard to find parts,btohqsg
Got a reason why it was used to be known as the ahbeng civic,btohqsg
BUT I STILL LOVE CIVIC. IDKY.,btohqsg
karting day u try my swift la  not the fastest but should be enough to satisfy 😅,btohqsg
Thing is  I haven't done my previous civic to the best of its potential yet. So that's why i still very 更更于怀,btohqsg
I think hard tbh. But I'll give it a try first.,btohqsg
drive around changi/expo that side ah if u want,btohqsg
Sooner or later more EVs and Hybrids on the road,btohqsg
Because its just a 1 Yr car. And it piang before  did a heart transplant  hence the name 2.2 civic. Haha. Thr alr cost me a bunch. Along the way  I feel like a lot things gg to brk down alr  axis  suspend  bumper etc all needed to change. But left 6 months and I haven't renew road tax. So is damn half fuck. Fix also like wasted  dont fix scared die  zeng also bohua. So i just sell.,btohqsg
No pops and bangs anymore  I guess?,btohqsg
Blue SG sounded kinda weird imo,btohqsg
If u hear a EV pop that means the lithium contacts short circuits and a 14 000 deg C fire is about to commence,btohqsg
It make the r35 exos flame look like a pussy,btohqsg
Now  can you imagine a convoy of Blue SG,btohqsg
LET THE PAST BE THE PAST,btohqsg
The meet/convoy can be named BLUEBALLS,btohqsg
I rather pay petrol drive own car,btohqsg
Otw to tuning.. fc nt bad hor? Hahaha,btohqsg
"Anyone willing to be an ""escort"" for my wedding",btohqsg
