I don't think so. I opened but din put funds. Nothing was charged. I know some people who opened fd acc first in anticipation to chiong the FD when there is promo cos acc opening especially new one will take awhile,btohqsg

Is getting confusing  too many info. Can i seek some advice  to see if this is correct? I am going for cashback mainly.Mrt/bus - SC smart CC 6%Paywave - SC smart 6%  uob evol 8% if can spend $600 per monthOnline spending ( e.g. shopee  lazada) - SC smart  uob evol 8%AXS related (e.g. tax  insurances) - top up grabpay with uob absolute (till 23jan23)  Amex tcb after that.Utility bills  hp bills - Uob One 3.33%Conservancy - ?Child Care - ?Sheng Siong - Bank of China SS CC 6%All other spending - HSBC revol 2.5%All above have no min. spend  so is alright to just use without monitoring.,btohqsg

After I have pair my Citi rewards card w amaze   if I pay all my bills with the amaze card will I still get my miles from Citi ?,btohqsg
Since they have all become online purchase,btohqsg
you still need to follow the MCC,btohqsg
Just pretend you go mcdonald  instead of order thru kiosk or cashier (offline retail/contactless)  you can order thru the mc mobile app (online transaction).What i would like to think is that Amaze pretends to be a online/app version of whatever merchants you trying to spend on.,btohqsg
Im confused by watching Chris recent vid on Basic Health Sum. If I already have 66k  will the next interest be transfer to SA or remain in Medisave as the BHS has increased to 68.5k?,btohqsg
If I don't rem wrongly  the interest will be transferred to the SA. Then u will continue to contribute to MA in 2023 till you hit new BHS agaib,btohqsg
Would recommend POSB everyday card for utilities spend (4-5% Cashback) and for sheng siong (7% Cashback currently). No min spend required for both categories.,btohqsg
Nice guidelines but take note some got min sum to meet so if don't meet the mim sum it's equal to useless,btohqsg

thanks  i sent a email to youtrip team  they told me it's currently high volume  it will take a long timeðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hello  In order to earn 4mpd on hsbc revo  I have to use Applepay right? Within their whitelist categories,btohqsg
Which telco you using? I taught Citibank cards excludes bill payment for cashback / miles reward?Iâ€™m using Circles Life,btohqsg
HSBC revolution and Citibank rewards card which one is more useful for daily spend,btohqsg
Yes I recall public transport rides are excluded. Only private hire and taxi rides get miles points.,btohqsg
Only online transactions qualify for 4mpd right? Any other methods apart from applepay and Samsung pay?,btohqsg
Update:LiquidPay reply but Iâ€™m getting them to confirm when will system be up and running. Anyone managed to use LiquidPay via credit card these days?,btohqsg
Just to update on liquidpay payment linked to CC  I tried it today at a food court by scanning the SG QR code at the stall and it seems to be working again. Payment went through ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
mobile contactless (applepay/samsung pay/gpay etc) or physical card paywave or online. MCC in whitelist,btohqsg
What I encountered for LiquidPay recently is that the system is unstable. When error is encountered  I just try again and it'll work on 2nd or 3rd try.,btohqsg
Another quick question. Did I earn the cashback if I were to pay using amex pay(amex version of paylah),btohqsg
Oh physical cars paywave eligible for 4mpd? Can check on their ibanking portal for points? Like CRMC,btohqsg
no lah  where to get Amex logo on QR for this,btohqsg
Cos those store that can grab QR  typically have amex pay QR too,btohqsg
for uob one card 500 monthly spending  does utilities bill count towards it? thank you,btohqsg
yes physical card paywave counted if mcc is in whitelist. No points breakdown,btohqsg
