I do a mix of tried and tested ETF and a mix of individual stock pick. But all negative. Lost faith and trust in investing,btohqsg

For now I still don't trust crypto. Cos idk how it works. But large cap stocks/etfis so disappointing that makes me tempted to do crypto,btohqsg
Oh my god  you buy more portfolio than me....... So sfye cash plus also negative like endowus....,btohqsg
Well guys  if you cant handle stock market fluctuation  please don't go YOLO crypto. That's even larger,btohqsg
With such diverisification still can all red? Impressive isn't it? Amazing....,btohqsg
Make sure you at least understand the basics of what you are buying first,btohqsg
Ah don't worry I'll withdraw soon so I don't get charged 0.65% a month,btohqsg
cannot handle the up and down,btohqsg
With syfe time doesn't matter one. It's always negative. U can put 1 year 5 year 10 years or until become Skelton  100% still negative.,btohqsg
I diamond hands in tiger for now. Won't sell. Cos I beleive in the fundamentals of my stock pick,btohqsg
Hahah yea I thinking sell syfe buy into stocks,btohqsg
Once you withdraw  you confirm lost... I will stay on since I don't need the fund now though a little disappointed...,btohqsg
"The facts and evidence is 100% red eh. Not about my emotions. Is just not true that what ""15% growth a year equity 100%"".U can see Chris video also.",btohqsg
Once it break even then will shift over to tiger lor. I won't paper loss sell,btohqsg
Unless u have better thing to buy,btohqsg
Yup. Pessimistic outlook. They said September most volalite I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. But now october also? Then what's next? Nov  Dec.. Jan  Feb all also most voalite?Not sure how many more apology email letter I'll recieve from syfe,btohqsg
Well  I am not sure if I am right. I will only sell when I need the money or I make profit.. else I will not sell... Any comments??,btohqsg
I only Sell when biz fundamental change or have better investment opportunities else wherre,btohqsg
I think Kelvin learns investing mentioned in his latest videos about not selling your winners and let it roll. Maybe u wanna take a look,btohqsg
Yeaa probably also shld sell some positions get some profits before it falls down again... haizzz,btohqsg
Yeah for me yes  or like Kenny mention  if i dont see it going up and i have other better choices,btohqsg
But I feel currently is just a normal market correction  although it does hurt.. hahah you are not alone,btohqsg
Thank u toLCMfor making me feel less lonely. At least now I know I'm not the only one suffering in depression in syfe. Perhaps we shld think about other platforms to reach out financial goals,btohqsg
Time to bring out this message again,btohqsg
"Hi guys  I know in times like this it is really tough and I'm not going to sugarcoat things here. The stock market has been correcting/crashing hard the past few weeks and is at ultimate Fear  Uncertainty & Doubt. In times like this when you don't have spare cash it is pointless to say things like ""buy more into the dip""  so I will just share some things you could do.1) Cut loser stocks which you have low conviction in  and add to your high conviction stocks which may have fallen too. Consider it a portfolio slimming diet2) Do nothing and diamond hands all the way. Sometimes doing nothing is better than doing the wrong thing.3) Sell a portion of portfolio that enable you to sleep well enough. Nothing matters more than your own health.But whatever you do  just don't sell your winners and add to your losers  things rarely work out that way.#NOTFINANCIALADVICE",btohqsg
ü§£ It's a good time to cultivate patience and courage :),btohqsg
Nowadays I don't open my syfe or tiger app. Refuse to check. Because I know  go in will see 100% all red... Really impacted mental health very badly,btohqsg
To be fair to Syfe  i think recent few months of also hard to analyse since market is under correction. Maybe if got anyone have longer time with Syfe can share? Or other platforms like Stashaway and Moneyowl?,btohqsg
Not sure how SA and MO is doing,btohqsg
Same case for me... but I will keep DCA monthly into stocksü§£,btohqsg
Maybe only open my tiger APP several times a month,btohqsg
You are not alone...... Hang on...,btohqsg
Yea.. I shldnt have entered the thematic portfolio so quickly haizz,btohqsg
"Stashaway even worse üòÇüòÇüòÇ that's the reason I went with syfe. + I avoided China exposure which is greater exposure in stashway general investing portfoilios.But even with my custom ETFs mainly US equities. Still drop. So I guess China or US don't matter bah. US ""debt ceiling"" = evergrande edition",btohqsg
I also did the same. Run away from SA. But who knows.. Luck is not on my side.Anyway.. Lets be patient and hope the market go back to moon. Hahaha...,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think will recover anytime soon. Just sink further and further in Nov  Dec  2022 and so on,btohqsg
Wow  this thread is becoming a support group for robo investments. üëç,btohqsg
I know it's a tough time for all of us investors but please do not turn this into a self pity support group. Whatever grieve you have with a particular robo  it applies throughout the market and it's not just you. As they say  misery loves company and I don't want to turn this into a negative atmosphere group. So would appreciate if you all cooperate  thanks.,btohqsg
