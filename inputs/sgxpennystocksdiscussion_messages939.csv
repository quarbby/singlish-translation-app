🚀From a hot economy to economic worries🚀It's a new tale branded in an old narrative. The once-hot economy we have been accustomed to for the past 1.5 years seems so distant. One that had put the Fed off the pedal on rate cuts.Now  the health of the economy is in question. Monday's economic data showed some economic cracks  though still on a healthy footing.🎯The Atlanta Fed  a key player in economic forecasting  released its much-followed GDPNow estimate. This estimate shows that growth from the second quarter is estimated to fall from a robust 2.7% to a more modest 1.8%  a significant shift that warrants attention.🎯Likewise  the ISM figures showed that manufacturing contracted larger than expected  a sign of a potential economic slowdown. Then comes the JOLTs  which reflects a cooling labor market. April's job openings fell to 8.1 million  the lowest level since Feb 2021  indicating a potential decrease in employment opportunities.🎯That's not all. Today  we continue to have a string of labour and ISM Non-Manufacturing data  which should help us assess the service economy  too  which has been running too hot for inflation to cool.The final key event will be on employment data on Friday. Even so  projecting into the next CPI and FOMC are the twin giants in the future.So what's the plan? Prepare for a volatile period for the first two weeks of June.Jordan.,btohqsg

🚀Pika World Breakfast Update - 6 June 2024🚀It's yet another record rally for the Nasdaq and S&P 500  supported by the sharp rise in Nvidia's shares. The chip company surpassed a valuation of $3 trillion  ahead of Apple's market capitalisation.🎲Recent data warms bet on Fed cuts.🥁The latest risk to sentiment in the equity market could be attributed to investors placing greater odds of a September rate cut  given recent weaker economic data on the US economy. Indeed  we are seeing downward pressure on disposable income  which fell 0.1% in April  marking the second decline seen in the prior three months.The savings rate also dipped to 3.6% in April and March  the lowest level seen since December 2022  which could reflect cooling consumer spending that fuels a large chunk of service inflation. Hence  it is a welcoming piece of data for the Fed.💰A Well-Balanced Goldilock Situation🗽Even as investors emphasize weaker growth as a positive sign  there are some green shoots in economic news. A fresh set of data from ISM showed Services MPI at 53.8%  which reflects the expansion of the services sector for 46 out of the last 48 months.Now  all eyes will be on Friday's morning job report for May  which is the market's biggest test of the week.📪What's on the menu today?📖At 8.30 pm  we will have the initial jobless claim. A further slowdown in the figure will be good news for the market.Likewise  the ECB will likely announce a rate cut by 25 basis points  which is the second central bank to cut rate after the BOC cut yesterday. This is welcoming  given the easing momentum globally.It is Thursday  June 6  at 8:50 a.m. in Singapore and 8:50 p.m. in New York. It is a sunny and warming morning. Aloha  and have a blissful day at work and in school.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
