In the contract  one of the T&C (briefed clearly to her) is no photo taking of my children. But her phone is filled with my son photos..,btohqsg
No chance given? It will take sometime to get a new helper too right..?,btohqsg
Contract is contract  terms written clearly in black and white,btohqsg
Wah. Really ah? If everyone thinks that way.. I guess I will have to do it.. the reason I hesitated here is we cannot manage without a helper.,btohqsg
Helper can always find new one  but what your little one go through (along with what you and your partner have to go through now) cannot be changed. Just My two cents worth,btohqsg
Yea.. understood.. she broke the rules and in fact I gave her bonus every quarter.. I thought I was treating her super good as a boss already... I never ordered her around or anything. Even on our trip to Genting  she loss at casino.. I pay her back when we came back SG,btohqsg
I haven't caught her in an inappropriate act so I cannot make police report right?If she is a pedophile  I want to make sure she receive her punishment and not just pure dismissal.. because someone else will engage her...,btohqsg
No more ez link card weekend promo?,btohqsg

Air bnb should be HSBC revolution? I think it's better if you check via heymax.. cause I'm not sure what cards you have..,btohqsg
Hsbc did nerf Airbnb rewards in Jan'24 .. not sure still worth it anot,btohqsg
Anyone here previous holding the amex krisflyer card (the blue one) and received a promo from amex sometime back in dec23/jan24  to get you to upgrade to the amex ascend card. Do you still have a screenshot of the promo?,btohqsg

Hello Group https://youtu.be/YbunknVryEM?si=60pHbnxCX-KaqYHjFrom the above video  I understand we can use amaze+citi in Kris +. May I know how to link the amaze card in my Kris + app. I‚Äôm an apple user.,btohqsg
U cant add amaze to apple pay currently,btohqsg
I have linked my amaze card to google pay. Is there a way I can use google pay to use my amaze card?,btohqsg
Yes just link google pay to your kris+,btohqsg
Then pay on Kris+ with Google Pay,btohqsg
How do I do that? For now it‚Äôs only showing my Apple Pay in Kris plus.,btohqsg
Yeah use an android device to make the payment..,btohqsg
Oh yeah thanks. So doesn‚Äôt work in iOS. Just read in milelion,btohqsg
As a reminder  if you pair the Citi Rewards Card with Apple or Google Pay  and use Apple or Google Pay to make anin-apptransaction with an app like Deliveroo or Kris+  you will only earn 0.4 mpd instead of 4 mpd.You can solve this problem by:1 Pairing the Citi Rewards Card with Amaze2 Adding Amaze to Google Pay3 Paying in-app with Google Pay using AmazeOf course  this workaround only applies to Android phones  sinceApple Pay does not support Amaze yet(while Google Pay can be installed on iPhone  you can‚Äôt use it for in-app transactions).,btohqsg
Yes. And next month is uob lady saving account,btohqsg
Can talk to the maid agency? But it‚Äôs pretty scary keeping her since she might take revenge if you report her,btohqsg

Hi hi  which credit cards gives enough rewards so that it is worth our while to use for Cardup for payment?,btohqsg
Is Trust app and Trust card system down? Tried to use the card to pay at Fair price but didn't work. But managed to offset purchase partially with Link points in the card after a few tries. Afterwards  launched app to check but it just showed blue screen. Same issue even after updating app,btohqsg
Overseas to Amaze  local to UOB PRVI.,btohqsg
I didn't go thru agency. It was a direct hire and it's her first time here in SG.,btohqsg
Hi all  will paying for GRAB rides directly using Citi Rewards get 4mpd? Or is GRAB MCC under travel??? üò¨üò¨,btohqsg
Can anyone clarify? Is the use of UOB One Credit card a qualified spend for Cardup? Heymax says that cardup spends are qualified but UOB One terms says Cardup spends are excluded from any cashback.https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/one_card_full_tnc.pdf?s_cid=grm:sg:paid:dis:pmax:na:bn:na:001843:121223-evergreen:onecreditq1:na:ms-sg&vid=ms-sg&pid=OCCPRSMCDCO,btohqsg
MCC for GRAB is 4121...can someone help me clarify if this qualifies for 10x points on Citi Rewards?,btohqsg
Card t&c will always be the greater truth,btohqsg
anyone knows how to change billing period for SP utilities,btohqsg
I think no replacement from agent already  I will just buy air ticket don't let her know  until 1-2 hr before fly  ask her to pack bag Infront of you  ask her delete all your family photo Infront of you. Maybe you can ask agent come over to assist you. Put you kids to somewhere else first. Send her to airport and make sure she go in the security gate.,btohqsg
No agent involved bro. Immediate termination will be my way of dismissal. But unfortunately  we cannot manage without a helper. I guess I'll have to make some arrangements like not to let her sleep with my son and closely monitor her.Will also collect the evidence when it happens and make an official police report if it happens again.. so she won't be able to work in SG anymore.,btohqsg
There is no record of OCBC infinity card on heymax  can I ask if I can get 1.6% cash by taking mrt?,btohqsg
You might want to check again. I'm sure it's there,btohqsg
Infinity Cashback card. I checked with smrt and simplyGo. no record of ocbc infinity cashback card,btohqsg
It's on heymax. But appears as excluded for SimplyGo. Heymax might be wrong  t&c still the greater truth.,btohqsg
Card t&c will always be the greater truth,btohqsg
It is stated excluding simply go in the t&c but I‚Äôm afraid there will be some thing I don‚Äôt knowüôä,btohqsg
If use uob one card to top up ezlink card at mrt station kiosk counted as¬† $500 spend ?,btohqsg
Why not jz use uob one card and tap at gantry ? Topping up is not considered as simplygo txn iirc,btohqsg
I want to ask about Money lock .For OCBC and UOB - example if I lock 100K from my UOB one and OCBC 360 respectively.This lock fund will continue to earn OCBC 360  save bonus interest and UOB one interest or not ?,btohqsg
For ocbc 360 yes. If meet requirements eg salary credit,btohqsg
