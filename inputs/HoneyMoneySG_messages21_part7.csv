Uob amex >  pre paid nets card > axsSold by MRT,btohqsg
My question remains. How do you top up nets flashpay with Amex?,btohqsg
Also axs does not accept nets flashpay. SAM does.,btohqsg
All prepaid nets are flash pay?Like this can't workSam don't support my bill ü§£,btohqsg
There's this one but you need to use the NETS App. GTM doesn't work.https://www.nets.com.sg/personal/retail-payments/nets-prepaid-card/,btohqsg
it does? That's news to me.,btohqsg
So I use net app top up via amex ?,btohqsg
The nets pay are use of netsapp,btohqsg
This method use to pay what I'm ax's app ? Insurance,btohqsg
If this no flashpay than work,btohqsg
This one is a flashpay + chip card,btohqsg
O ya look sameI thought saw the word flashpay inside,btohqsg
Shifus - any credit card can bao ga Liao - recurring bills for SP  senoko  Singtel + rewards for groceries at NTUC + simplygo with reasonable min spend?OCBC 365 card With OCBC 360 bank account? Sad bird bird December promo so fast all redeem  usually got new rewards soon mah?Thanks for any help! :) just grad and first month with salary,btohqsg
It's flash pay than don't work,btohqsg
Don't think use Amex tip up will have points,btohqsg
Curious - anyone on the GXS platform yet?,btohqsg
Applied Amex TCB card. Any idea how long it will take to arrive ?,btohqsg
Whats the procedure to open joint account?,btohqsg
The NETS prepaid card looks like it might work with TCB but not Absolute (since Absolute outright exludes NETS transactions),btohqsg
Hospital bill u see if u can pay using Amex. If can  then use AMEX TCB 1.5% or UOB Absolute Amex 1.7%.For wedding venue. Same strategy if u have enough credit balance that is. But for myself  since I‚Äôm using UOB ONE  I ask the hotel to split the cost into monthly instalment and every month I pay manually using my UOB ONE card to hit the $2k quota.,btohqsg
TCB approval and sending of card one of the fastest if no issue,btohqsg
I use UOB ONE.Base 3.33% rebate on eligible spend.For SP u get 1% more rebate. Total 4%Electricity provider  mobile phone bills get base 3.33%.Simply go get extra 5-6.67%. Total 8.87-10%,btohqsg
The NETS transactions exclusion is for using the Absolute card as a NETS card  not for topping up NETS cards. However  question still remains: NETS app allows Amex top ups meh.,btohqsg
according to the FAQ looks like its supported,btohqsg
i guess we'll have to see how Absolute handles this transaction,btohqsg
Your breakeven point is a $30 top up (assuming 1.7% cashback on UOB Absolute),btohqsg
If you're using it solely to pay for bills it seems ok,btohqsg
Dotm think axs accept nets card as pay all type right?,btohqsg
Some needs bank transfer to pay,btohqsg
Not sure  the prepaid card is a new thing,btohqsg
But looks like anywhere that accepts NETS can accept the card,btohqsg
The nets card I think can buy from mrt station the booth,btohqsg
Ya but from the looks here mostly is eanr to use thsk hacks to pay via axs ahah not use nets to pay on retailers,btohqsg
More like a replacement for grab Nerf,btohqsg
Yes netsapp support AMEXHave added my card to itSimply go support amex as well can add nets card to simply go for top-upOr top-up from the MRT station machine,btohqsg
Topping up the nets not a issueIs this nets card bought from MRT stationIs it support by axs,btohqsg
If u use simplygo with uob absolute card will not earn 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
Oooh! Because UOB Absolute Card uses NETS for SimplyGo which is an excluded transaction from cashback.,btohqsg
Don't think so it support netpay not this net prepaid,btohqsg
Are you able to paynow your UOB one account with ref paynow sala and that will fulfil that requirement?,btohqsg
Anyone applied for amex tcb card?,btohqsg
Uob absolute to grabpay nerfed from 1.7% to 0.3%?,btohqsg
Thanks  still worth to use uob one to pay insurance premiums using ipaymy,btohqsg
I thought ipaymy is excluded from uob one card?,btohqsg
For those who frequent Fraser malls..,btohqsg
Use Amex Cashback top up grab 1.5% cashback + frx gift card 10% + grab power up challenges + 600 grab point earn per 100 dollars spend. Good deal üëçüòÑ,btohqsg
Hi sifus  i just applied UOB Absolute CB Card from Singsaver last two weeks ago.Should i continue with the application as they requested additional documents but it is going to nerf the grab topup?But Singsaver is giving $300 cash!,btohqsg
get it  faster milk it before 15 Jan and claim the signup bonus. Then wait until AF charged then cancel.,btohqsg
Would it affect the credit report if cancel the credit card so early?,btohqsg
I think you can continue to use. 1.7% no limit. except Grab wallet top up has dropped to 0.3%. But one thing you need to note - this card cannot be use on (e.g.) Samsung pay.. for mobile spend...,btohqsg
