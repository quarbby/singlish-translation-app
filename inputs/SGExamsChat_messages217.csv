I don't think distinction rates are publicly known,btohqsg
Well if someone were to go dig,btohqsg
hey anyone's volunteering currently  and can intro :O,btohqsg
any wanna just look around for opportunities those on google seem p dated,btohqsg
SGExams got alot of opportunities HAHA,btohqsg
where do I look into? :O,btohqsg
just keep a lookout on our platforms haha  we hold recruitment drives p often,btohqsg
What kind of volunteering do you have in mind,btohqsg
got alot of diff roles for u to choose from aso  so u can prolly find one that fits,btohqsg
There's volunteering to entertain the elderly/do weekly checks and talk to them,btohqsg
There's giving tuition to under-privileged children,btohqsg
There's helping to distribute food to people,btohqsg
There's also stuff like volunteering at RCs or Community Centres (though I'm not sure how you should go about that),btohqsg
Really depends on what kind of thing you want to do,btohqsg
"his real name is ""your highness and most glamourous element xenon""",btohqsg
okies will keep a look out! :),btohqsg
nobility usually have cancerously long names,btohqsg
Xe isn’t really noble.. it’s quite reactive as a noble gas,btohqsg
It's why I love Xenon though,btohqsg
"when you first learn chemistry you learn all these ""rules""",btohqsg
XePtF6 was the first noble compound I found about,btohqsg
Well I never took chem in jc so,btohqsg
It makes chem much more interesting,btohqsg
Learnt till the day you took psle math,btohqsg
Because you won’t apply in sec and thereafter,btohqsg
Sec Chem too.. it’s mostly half-truths,btohqsg
No offence to the sec sch students here,btohqsg
yea the fun part about jc chem is learning that exceptions exist,btohqsg
and there are alot of them,btohqsg
Hmm yes even to sec Chem.. notice there are 2-3 exceptions usually,btohqsg
2 insoluble chlorides  3 insoluble sulfates,btohqsg
2 oxides of metals above H can be reduced by H2,btohqsg
Silver carbonate is the only carbonate that decomposes to metal,btohqsg
2 metal carbonates cannot be decomposed thermally,btohqsg
haha i wanna bring up something about this,btohqsg
If you had platinum carbonate it'd probably decompose to metal too,btohqsg
at a higher level  we are taught that calcium sulfate is actually soluble,btohqsg
Yeah everything does in varying extents,btohqsg
someone asked the prof about this  and he got roasted pretty badly,btohqsg
If not Ksp will be 0,btohqsg
Yeah haha but super tough lah,btohqsg
guys if someone just reply ‘Ok’,btohqsg
does that mean they’re mad at you,btohqsg
well not for me 🤔 but idk,btohqsg
whatever im in deep trouble lol,btohqsg
depends on how they usually text,btohqsg
i dont wanna open the msg cause ill immediately double tick it lol,btohqsg
If they say kk  you ask hospital?,btohqsg
i think that makes things worse tbh,btohqsg
Anyway good reminder to use it,btohqsg
Got one assignment is to help student do berries homework. 😂,btohqsg
Wat for go berries? Just go tuition can liao,btohqsg
Why must be long and big leh,btohqsg
My friend told my chem teacher about it,btohqsg
He also jokingly snitches on me that i taught him this,btohqsg
Then my chem teacher was like eh bro what you watching ah,btohqsg

u either commit an offence while in army  or your religion is Jehovah's witness,btohqsg
But JW recieves alot of priviledges,btohqsg
is a religion whereby ppl do not believe in using weapon for war  and thus they get charged for it,btohqsg
Theres a rather popular US movie on this,btohqsg
some medic who was a Jehovah's witness  then he saved the lives of many others on a battlefield,btohqsg
ORD is the day you finish your NS,btohqsg
if im not wrong it was inspired from a real story,btohqsg
i guess they have a common trait of not touching weapons too then,btohqsg
yeah but JW is kinda more extreme,btohqsg
Is my pet dog eligible then,btohqsg
if he can fill up the application form I don't see why not,btohqsg
Aight i'll fill up for him. He is very agreeable  and disciplined. Rarely shits on the couch,btohqsg
Can we apply for multiple positions?,btohqsg
How do we do so? They allowed us to put 1 position,btohqsg
Do we submit it multiple times for different positions?,btohqsg
Need new mods to take over please,btohqsg
Someone take over John Smith  I volunteer Bedok,btohqsg
new mods to take over more like new mods to spend all their time in discord pepeconcerning everything,btohqsg
don't exactly rmb... but it'll run till at least mid Jan,btohqsg
don't quote me on that though,btohqsg
Are you guys planning on accepting about 1 person per role or more?,btohqsg
different roles are recruiting different amounts of people. unfortunately we aren't releasing information about how many ppl we'll be accepting for each role,btohqsg
As in take over as tele head haha,btohqsg
Oof yeah  he was a Seventh Day Adventist,btohqsg
Bruh WTF sgexams has a HR department?,btohqsg
we have a lot of ppl in the committee HAHA,btohqsg
need ppl to help manage everything,btohqsg
How many pax you have in total wtf,btohqsg
I thought it was you and soon kueh and a couple of others only,btohqsg
that would have been the case,btohqsg
I know haha I was added to the admin group a year ago to sort out some drama happening in the groups,btohqsg
ya p much a year ago we were like 2/3 times smaller than now,btohqsg
and was promptly kicked out again :(,btohqsg
massive growth with the times man,btohqsg
Bruh yall have a friggin sysadmin to handle your emails,btohqsg
most startups dont even have that shit,btohqsg
tbh we need a lot of ppl partially cause we're volunteer based,btohqsg
can I be a professional banterer,btohqsg
we don't overload anyone mah  so need more ppl to cover the work,btohqsg
who is actually in charge of career guidance,btohqsg
I'd imagine recruiting people from here who barely made it out into the real world cant really give good guidance,btohqsg
no la  in charge of career guidance doesn't mean they'll be the ppl guiding,btohqsg
bruh I wanna fill it in,btohqsg
we do collabs with different organisations who can provide professionals,btohqsg
like our recent mental health stuff,btohqsg
but it kinda asks for a lot of personal info (or stuff that will divulge your actual identity),btohqsg
u can be a low-key committee member lor,btohqsg
it's not like we publish our member list,btohqsg
breh throw me into the holistic development group plzzz,btohqsg
Yea  no one will know one ^,btohqsg
in fact i figure that most of the 50+ ppl that are in the team are anonymous  or lurkers in the community,btohqsg
(this is why we need HR aso HAHAHA need to manage recruitment),btohqsg
i think volunteering in sgexams is q like other orgs in some ways la,btohqsg
anonymity is hard since sometimes we have offline events,btohqsg
its work that needs work to be done  i can say that much,btohqsg
think of all the benefitsmeet new pplget exp working w other ppl and other organisationsget stuff to put in portfoliolearn new stuff aso,btohqsg
Milo  I thot u flexing Ur bicep,btohqsg
If I join holistic development and eventually become the chief,btohqsg
I wanna be known as the chief of the holy d,btohqsg
no sproot bc i was stuck in online camp tdy,btohqsg
HAHA we have our processes in place due to past experiences,btohqsg
I put the ass in passion,btohqsg
we aso dw it to be this long,btohqsg
mehhhhI'm not at liberty to discuss that,btohqsg
but trust us when we say that we don't want our recruitment process to be this long too,btohqsg
I think i sorta have a clue HAHA,btohqsg
lets just say we wanna know the people we're looking at,btohqsg
i feel like i have no relevant skills to contribute,btohqsg
but i still want to join,btohqsg
Describe the role you envision SGExams playing in Singapore's student community 5 years down the road.,btohqsg
I imagine yall organising student strikes and launching a takeover coup of MOE,btohqsg
we got alot of roles where u don't need like specific skillset,btohqsg
we want to work tgt with them  but at the same time we maintain our independence,btohqsg
since when does MOE wanna work with anyone unless its to strengthen their image or narrative,btohqsg
MOE actually q open to working w us  and in fact we've worked w them before,btohqsg
cuz you dont wanna be too weighed down by the relationship,btohqsg
but working with SGExams here would boost their image,btohqsg
that's an interesting way to look at it,btohqsg
we've had multiple meetings  face to face before covid  and a couple of zoom calls during covid  with MOE,btohqsg
Tbh HR very technical one la,btohqsg
no la haha  like say the holistic development team  or the student welfare,btohqsg
LOL 10/10 would watch this show,btohqsg
it can go both ways  and I think the team is q happy that MOE is v open with working with us,btohqsg
the most important thing in the end  beyond your hard skills would basically be your spirit,btohqsg
legit first day having a break this week,btohqsg
It is the year 2025 and covid has finally ravaged this barren wasteland we call earth. Civil society is in disarray as the streets are littered with corpses.Out of this chaos rises the SGExams team who ensures that all the remaining students have good mental health and are succeeding in their A/O levels and becoming useful citizens of the new world order *theme song plays*,btohqsg
To apply for Tele admin click which department ah,btohqsg
can I be in the committee yet,btohqsg
platform mods recruitment is on a later date,btohqsg
