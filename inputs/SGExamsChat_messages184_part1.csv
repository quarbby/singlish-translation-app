they may test on like a issue,btohqsg
but the sources cover diff parts of the world,btohqsg
it might b like 2018 2019 sbq,btohqsg
So what do yâ€™all reckon the SRQ tomorrow will be,btohqsg
hi for this when they say i must sit for this exam  does this mean i need to pass also or as long as i sit for it it's fine?,btohqsg
"So if it were called ""east asian flu"" it wont be interpreted as implicitly accusatory?",btohqsg
I would say so  given that it would be regional and not sovereign based,btohqsg
China has enough landmass to be considered a region though,btohqsg
"Plus in the case of the spanish flu  though it was a misnomer  it points directly to a nation.So would it be okay to name a flu that started in another country as the ""chinese flu""?",btohqsg
Keep in mind  spain has way more reason to be pissed. It had a flu named after it even though it never originated in it,btohqsg
"I would say given the shifting culture and globalisation of the 21st century  the concept of naming is much more delicate compared to linguistical developments.Note that spain has actively protested against the name ""spanish flu"" and the general culture of lack of globalisation or intolerance during the 1910s.For a repeat and parallel of that in the 2020s would therefore be ridiculous",btohqsg
But that would be self contradictory  because china by itself is a sovereign legal entity. I dont think borders and regionality- a reference to the continent  is meant to interchangeable,btohqsg
Negative. Id say that with the developments in science and globalisation  the priority has shifted away from petty naming squabbles to actual containment and medicinal research.The first priority should have been to find a cure  rather than use the disease as political ammunition in global agencies.The unnecessary dispute in terminology has forced scientists to repeatedly reauthor their research papers and fractured the international community along political lines,btohqsg
Petty would therefore be subjective. Where is your basis in claiming that? The whole idea of respect is that one cannot take a subjective claim into a claim that is subjectively put to moot by another party,btohqsg
Do you put naming disputes above the preservation of human lives?,btohqsg
given the context that Trump has a prima facie hostility against china and that he was on active advocacy to call it the chinese flu  one can see the principle that one is entitled to defend or retaliate to hostilities in a reasonable way.,btohqsg
thats a fallacy because you are assuming what i am saying therefore i am not answering that.,btohqsg
you assumed that the priority of saving lives have being neglected by naming disputes  when there is no quantifiable evidence that because of the naming disputes  lives have being lost.,btohqsg
Would any sane global entity (let alone one of the greatest growing powers in the world) hinder global scientific and containment efforts because of a naming dispute?,btohqsg
A waste of time isnt it?,btohqsg
there is no evidence  that because of naming disputes  global scientific and containment efforts have being hindered,btohqsg
and therefore  it is an uncalled assumption,btohqsg
Beyond the scientific community  it has also cause misinformation amongst the general population. How do you expect the general public to keep up with the rapid name changes? How would they keep abreast of the disease if it were called one name today and another name tomorrow? All because of a petty politiking,btohqsg
in which I would say that is a very  very possible but one of hardly any significance. Name change hardly implies that the distribution of information would be affected. WHO has changed the names multiple times and no one has criticised that. You are once again committing circular reasoning because your of whole presumption of a subjective goal of a nation is not meant to be significant,btohqsg
a possibility of an existence does not give weight to probability and significance,btohqsg
"So how is the general public supposed to follow guidelines and advices promulgated by their governments and health ministries if they are not even aware of what the disease is called? Especially in countries where enforcement is weak and the public relies on information from news channels and newspapers? What about the illiterate who can only listen to auditory guidelines? These forms a large proportion of the global population  FYI. And they are one of the most vulnerable groups too.Okay fine. Lets talk it through. What does china  one of the rising superpowers of the world have to lose if its called the chinese flu? A bit of international prestige? A slap on the wrist by international agencies? Loss of allies (tightly bound by the ""belt and road initiative"")? China faces 0 threat to its sovereignty. Whats other countries gonna do? Declare war? Never. Aint happening.On the other hand  think of how many lives are lost in developing countries because of the petty acts of that great nation",btohqsg
People have criticised it. Else this argument wont be happening right now haha. People criticised the slow response and unnecessary renamings of the virus by WHO,btohqsg
"1. I think that is a major assumption to say that unawareness will come from different name changes. At this point  it is actually a safe assumption that most countries will know that the ongoing pandemic is known as ""covid""  and if one day it would be called bazinga flu everyone will still know what pandemic we are talking about- due to the prevalence. The extremely niche examples you are giving is being shoehorned to being a representative of the general population on a proportion scale.2. I think you do not have a right understanding of international law. No matter how insignificant a ""threat"" is to a country  they are entitled to retaliate as long as it is reasonable- doesnt have to be a use of force- as long as it is proportionate. This is based on the UN charter 1 and 7. Just because there is no ""quantifiable"" damage doesnt mean that a country should "" suck it up"".3. well  is there any evidence of that? any correlation?",btohqsg
"many people have criticised the chinese for causing the virus  and people have criticised trump for having call it ""chinese flu"". A criticism while valid  does not give weight to it by itself. My point while lie corrected  is also moot by itself.",btohqsg
1. Perhaps it is now. But keep in mind that the name changes were occurring as COVID was just beginning to spread across the world. Guidelines changed frequently and those in developing nations were not getting information as quickly. Take into account the fact that the name had to be translated to many different languages. Perhaps if the name hasnt been changed so many times  developing countries might have been able to react?And lets be clear here. A single life lost due to this renaming is a life too many.2. Of course countries are entitled to do many petty things  but a responsible country should consider its reaction and its potential global impact. Now perhaps some official high up in the opaque ruling party has decided that a bit of prestige is worth inconveniencing the world and slowing the global scientific advance against the virus. Legal? Yeah. Is china acting like the power that it is going to be? Definitely not.,btohqsg
and to point 3  studies have not been done because the effects and numbers can and should only be done in the aftermath of this virus  so the overall impact can be assessed properly. But again. A single life is too much for political ambition,btohqsg
"1. That so  but the argument you have put forth was that the chinese reaction to the name "" chinese flu"" is unjustified  when the chinese are requesting the official name given by WHO (COVID19)- who has condemned naming of pandemics that are based on geographical locations  while Trump has evidentially went out of the way ( cancelling ""corona"" and writing china in his speech) to call it the chinese virus. If your argument applied  wouldnt it therefore  be America's problem and not the chinese reaction?2. My point above. China being blamed for reacting to an active  positive act of political aggression is kinda... sino-phobic3. thats an extremist view  bordering on the line on purely theoratical and utopian. I think its best that I do not address that as it is while idealistic and concedingly a benchmark to work for  it is impractical.",btohqsg
"the other hand also is valid. Trump's naming of the chinese virus has caused documented cases of racism against asian americans and chinese. Actual violence and discrimination occured due to the connotation that the ""chinese"" caused the virus- wouldnt it therefore flow from your logic  that in justifying the use of COVID19 and not ""chinese"" flu  that China is effectively preventing said abuse and assualt?",btohqsg
1. Chinese requested the amendment before trump had gave his speech. So who initiated it? Who wanted to dissociate itself from the virus that originated from its lands?2. Well  you could consider that trump  as a responsible and capable leader who understands the american public  knows that the virus is most well known amongst the population as the chinese/wuhan virus. He is simply taking a pragmatic approach by calling it as what it is best known as in his country  in order to best inform the american public.3. Human life is above all. If a single person has died because of chinese politiking  the chinese communist party has blood on its hands. Especially if the party has considered the possibility and international impact  then it has committed intentional murder. If it HASNT considered this possibility  then its ranks are filled with politicians that lack foresight.,btohqsg
People on the streets were already calling the virus the wuhan/chinese virus before trump said it himself. Trump simply used the name that it is best known by. Prejudice amongst the american public would already have had taken root,btohqsg
i think its ok  it wasnt personal  william is a trump supporter that is against china  there is nothing inherently wrong with that as its an opinion ( which i disagreed with),btohqsg
Tho i touch news very less,btohqsg
But the way he handle covid kind of makes be suspect that he isn't doing it right,btohqsg
And blaming it came from china,btohqsg
try being a president of a country that has to handle 350million idiots who go for george floyd protests without masks and destroys infrastructures.,btohqsg
take away trump's racism comments  lgbt hate etc. he will be one of the greatest president since obama's rulings,btohqsg
that i agree  just because he is different doesnt mean he is bad by itself,btohqsg
why get so offended by a fat dude comments  just close your ears and enjoy the benefits that he has made  10 million more jobs and economy  lesser homeless people on streets,btohqsg
"everyone just hated trump because ""other people hate him too"" have your own voice and opinion  don't follow suit",btohqsg
I'd say Obama helped america recover economically while trump brought the country to new heights,btohqsg
i mean his geopolitical aggression towards china is uncalled for  but i dont deny the economic re-vitalisation he has done,btohqsg
both are instrumental to where america is at right now,btohqsg
also trump is a president who speaks the truth directly and ruthlessly  i rather have my president tell me the truth then have obama sugar coat everything,btohqsg
biden got nothing on trump  the only thing he can do is minimize border security to allow for easier immigration  allow lgbt couples to marry publicly and allow abortions. thats all.,btohqsg
