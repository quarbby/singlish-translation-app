Even if they don‚Äôt talk  i also don‚Äôt like it when there are people behind me,btohqsg
I feel like if they quietly watch without commenting  I'm fine.,btohqsg
It's those who can't seem to shut up.,btohqsg
I win money I quietly win.,btohqsg
I lose money I quietly lose.,btohqsg
Some waiting for the chance ride on ur luck mah. U will see some will come over and stack their chips on top of u when u are on the roll. And they usually hit the table limit one,btohqsg
Abit crowded the last time I went and almost bumped into a kid who suddenly got in my way and he cried lol but I never bump into him,btohqsg
I ever had someone ride my luck before on roulette  but I was fine with it because he was a classy player.,btohqsg
The view is nice but just don‚Äôt look down HAHAHA,btohqsg
That why i only play with my family members. At least we are familiar with each other.,btohqsg
Did that and my mind was playing last destination üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Unfortunately within my immediate family gambling is banned apart from buying 4D on special occasions. And we haven't visited our extended family in ages in Malaysia so no mass gambling session.,btohqsg
For someone who's a heathen sinner like me  my immediate family background is very much like being from a temple.,btohqsg
I think the kind of losses at Blackjack that will really tilt me is if I get 20 and stand  and then dealer get immediate Blackjack just by opening his other card without even drawing.,btohqsg
My dad side all can gamble. We all risk takers,btohqsg
You answered the wrong person lol.,btohqsg
On hindsight  I do like the view when looking down tho,btohqsg

My frd bring in sweets which is banned in genting casino.,btohqsg
I am not sure if it is true. My buddy told me because they feared u ‚Äúfeed‚Äù to those kid ghosts which will help you in winning $.,btohqsg
Lol  winning in the casino is ultimately about how long you can outlast the pendulum swings of the wins and losses. And when you know to cut and run.,btohqsg
Nothing to do with supernatural help.,btohqsg
Luck and the strategy you have.,btohqsg
I have my own strategy for roulette  and my own risk appetite for Blackjack.,btohqsg
Anyway i just played to try only. It‚Äôs quite fun.,btohqsg
Yeah  you can learn a lot about yourself from gambling.,btohqsg
My frd played to lose all the $,btohqsg
She just want to lose and go off,btohqsg
That's the best mentality arguably to have when going into a casino  just being mentally prepared to lose all your capital you go in with. Once you can make peace with that  that's when you can gamble rationally and be calculated in your strategy.,btohqsg
If i am tired or lazy  i will step away. No need to play liao. Coz confirm will lose. Why waste the $ n time?,btohqsg
Her thoughts is she is lazy. Just want to get it over and leave,btohqsg
Yes surely u need to be mentally prepared and have a limit of how much you are prepared to lose. But to lose all is not in my strategy just because i want to get it over with.,btohqsg
Yes I do need money  do you have any in GBP for me please?,btohqsg
