Depends on your bill types. Some are excluded from earning rewards,btohqsg
I saw that too. Like most don't allow insurance premium,btohqsg
I emailed them today to complain about the Expedia being unavailable and they finally acknowledged my 14.5% cashback discrepancy in December. They will topup my missing cashback from 12.5% to 14.5%. I had 5 bookings affected.They also acknowledged an issue with the Expedia cashback on 16th January.All those who did Expedia at 14.5% on 12th December  suggest you double check your cashback tracked amount.It should be Hotel Amount (tax excluded) x 14.5% if u booked between 12-2am on 12th December 2024.,btohqsg
Any recommendations CC for Harvey Norman physical store. $5000.Looking for 4 miles per dollar or at least 3% cashback.,btohqsg
4 mpds got cap  unless they agree to split the payment.Your best bet is Kris+ and UOB KF (3 mpd on full amount).,btohqsg
Then your choice is limited. As different card for different bills to optimised cashback. I guess you better just continue paying direct. Not worth the effort and money tied to secured cc.,btohqsg
O this is also good! Thanks thanks,btohqsg
What's a good credit card to use for one-time overseas spend for a trip? (ie car rentals/food etc). Not intending to continue using after the tripI currently have mari card but my credit limit is stuck at 2k. Was thinking to apply for Trust and spend it overseas together with the mari card. Good idea?,btohqsg
Hi Guys  it seem heymax cannot work on trust linkpoint card. So it is pointless to use this card in heymax correct?,btohqsg
Hi gurus not sure if my method of calculation is correct. If ocbc website shows my current mab is 100k and it is 1000 increase as compared to the last month and my balance in the account is only 98k now. If I were to keep the sum. Intact  my MAB would be like 100k and I assume I need to transfer like 12500 on 1st Feb to hit the 500 increase? My question would be:1) Should I transfer out like 70 or 75k tomorrow to reduce my MAB as I am trying to reset my 360 account; or2) my calculation is wrong and it is safe to keep the 98k still inside my account.Thank you gurus for the help.,btohqsg
Don't really get what you're typing... But this is what I'm interpreting:Dec MAB: $99000Current MAB for Jan: $100000Current increment MAB: $1000If you want to be as close to $500 increment MAB ($99500)  you need to have at least $84500 in your account at the end of tomorrow  or $90000 if you want to be safe  includes buffer for any inaccuracies in your original message.If you keep your MAB at $100000  then you will need $100500 to be in the account from 1 Feb onwards.,btohqsg
Yes I wanted to achieve as close as possible to 500 mab so that my Feb mab can be lower. Thank you guru.,btohqsg
Best to calculate yourself and not rely on my calculation,btohqsg
Hi all  when i use Kris+ app to made payment using UOB KF CCdoes the UOB KF earn 3 mpd on full amount or must be in blocks of $5also  do i earn the miles straightaway? need to wait of the 14th months caveat?,btohqsg
What is the max amount to earn the 3.7%?,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/264609Interest rates might be different in Feb. You'll have to wait for tomorrow or Monday for the official t&c.,btohqsg
Kris+ spending 3mpd comes in following month  no need to wait 14 months. Also subjected to $5 rounding.,btohqsg
hi all- typically how long does Longbridge take for withdrawal?,btohqsg
Hmm lots of my uob transactions from 26 and 27 are still not posted  esp those on uob vs üòÖ,btohqsg
Pray the merchant post today and reflect the posting tomorrow. All my transactions till 27 Jan already posted less SimplyGo because they always take 4 business days.,btohqsg
Oh I'm in trouble. I missed out that the utility bills have rebate and I am not charged. Need to get something using my uob one card. Would anyone knows if getting giant vouchers at giant supermarket would count please? Not sure what can I get there.,btohqsg
Too late to charge  it's last day of jan,btohqsg
For this  if I transfer $50K new funds in within the next few days  and once it was earmarked for 5 months  possible to withdraw some money from those funds not earmarked?,btohqsg
Will I be penalised for that?,btohqsg
Just plot the numbers every day to excel file and get the average,btohqsg
qn: OCBC mobile app cannot pay Citibank credit already? can't find Citibank under billing organisation list,btohqsg
"Search ""same day spend"". Good luck",btohqsg
Do normal FAST transfer to the CC number will do,btohqsg
I see  let me try. thanks,btohqsg
On paper  UOB have rights to claw back rewards.,btohqsg
should be few business days as per other investment platforms,btohqsg

Does HSBC EGA giro still give 1% cashback for payment to other bank credit card? I read somewhere that it has discontinued ?,btohqsg
Hmm‚Ä¶ yes meaning the 1% still applies?,btohqsg
Yes. And you should find other more reliable sources for information.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if anyone knows - for DBS wwmc the 1.5k cap/mth for bonus point  is it based on calendar mth?,btohqsg
based on transaction date (of the merchant) within calendar month,btohqsg
Because it show this in heymax.üòÇ,btohqsg
Link it for tracking mcc and other heymax promo for visa cards.Trust link points can be managed in trust app anyway.,btohqsg
Hi all  what‚Äôs the recommended savings account for a fresh grad?,btohqsg
Anyone have any opinions on downgrading integrated shield plan from private to just restructured hospitals. The idea behind this is that i‚Äôm also getting older and premiums are getting higher. Weighing the pros and cons beside cost cutting. Anyone has also gone thru the stage to either upgrade or downgrade the plan?,btohqsg
This is the only visa card i had  was planning to participate in heymax promotion for the miles for transportation campaign. Will see if it works with this card next week. üòÆ‚Äçüí®,btohqsg
For transportation promo w heymax  it should work.,btohqsg
Check UOB one and ocbc 360. HSBC ega is for a bit more advance.,btohqsg
UOB one useful only if the fresh grad has $150k of funds lying around,btohqsg
Those 2 accounts are straight forward. Fell free to suggest too.,btohqsg
3% p.a. for the lowest tier is still pretty decent.,btohqsg
dbs multiplier has pretty low interest (below 3%) without insurance/invest/home loan.,btohqsg
No la don‚Äôt say only if‚Ä¶ I feel it‚Äôs good to encourage to even start small and slowly build up. In life we don‚Äôt always have to maximize from beginning..the process to get there is equally important as long as we start on it‚Ä¶,btohqsg
