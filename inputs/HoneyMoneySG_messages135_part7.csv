I think it got nerfed end of June 2024,btohqsg
Can I check if there’s anyone out there (like me) decided to accept higher dividend withholding tax and DCA with US domiciled ETF - VOO and VT on MooMoo  rather Ireland domiciled ETF - CSPX and VWRA on IBKR just purely because like MooMoo more…,btohqsg
Nothing wrong. Aswronglong as it suits you thats what matters most,btohqsg
the significant difference in withholding tax could hurt his long run performance though,btohqsg
Thank you sir  haha I’m trying to look for like minded people otherwise it might look like I’m just crazy 😂 I just prefer moomoo,btohqsg
you are basically paying for the moo moo preference,btohqsg
Haha yea… I’m aware 😢😢 knn if moomoo offers LSE = end game,btohqsg
yeah what i do is just put numbers out there as facts. But what investors ultimately do  there is some emotional aspect that cannot be quantified,btohqsg
For me I use cc for scoot then business class for SQ.,btohqsg
lol ridiculous..i just transferred about $200k over a period of one month to my extended household (of course different name).. also kenna questioned by banks now,btohqsg
Many scam mah. Maybe just ask to confirm?,btohqsg
yeah yeah i am not complaining they are penalising me..i am just saying... this is not an uncommon thing... somemore it is gradual transfers over one monthlike this also need to ask?,btohqsg
I think from bank perspective it is a problem of striking balance  but if like u transfer them before from years before then abit... err...,btohqsg
After the fujian gang saga  now bank due diligence team very strict on check,btohqsg
They scared you kena scam la. Just doing their job to make sure you know what you are doing 😅 glad they are vigilant. Imagine this is some unsuspecting individual who transfer 200k over one month to their “lover”….,btohqsg
but but but... what if i am really transferring to my secret lover... then they wanna expose me!?,btohqsg
Of cos they will expose you 🤣,btohqsg
jokes asides.. it does make transferring money to 3rd parties quite irritating..even when it is legitimate,btohqsg
dunno u all get what i mean or not...something like.. it is my money leh.. why u asking so many questions,btohqsg
So that is the reason. 😏,btohqsg
"If new pattern of transfers emerge  their system may flag it.  If transferring to the old regulars  then they might term it as ""routine"".",btohqsg
Curious  is this same 3rd party u have been transferring to?,btohqsg
transfer $200k one shot... sure kenna questioni spread out $40k over 5 weeks... ALSO KENNA QUESTIONhow to win,btohqsg
Wow. 包养费40k per week.  Mt you are rich. 😮😮😮😮,btohqsg
not the first time i receive and transfer from this 3rd partybasically a while ago.. that 3rd party transferred me money to play savings promo... then recently i returned that person..,btohqsg
I will prefer banks to call me than not call me. For security issues .,btohqsg
and actually in my comments i already stated our relationshipbut i guess because we don't have a joint account with this bank... i can understand why they cannot link the relationship easily,btohqsg
"Becos the banks might have some requirements by MAS to put in place for reporting ""strange transactions"" and the banks have to find out the reasons before submitting these individuals.",btohqsg
Banks don't know if you are the actual person doing the transfer. They need to call to confirm.,btohqsg
yeah i guess it is a delicate balance...because really a lot of scams out there now... no choice just have to endure loh,btohqsg
this one i heard before horror stories..if bank call you  you never pick up because busy or overseas or what... the bank will send Termination Letter..i don't think it is fake story,btohqsg
Termination letter ? I'm not sure about this. 😅,btohqsg
Is this offer applicable to existing UOB card holders?,btohqsg
It’s a nerve? Still worth for card-up payment?,btohqsg
how did you see this a nerf?,btohqsg
No idea. 🤷 cause local spend become 1$ to 1.3 miles.,btohqsg
where is that? Chris post and website still said 1.4mpd,btohqsg
dear  have you had coffee today?,btohqsg
Sorry maybe I got it wrong.. I not sure if got impact or not,btohqsg
your screenshot said 1.4mpd. Anyway  no impact. Visa is still a good card for cardup.,btohqsg
"If anyone is in Thailand now and using a UOB/DBS card for payments  could you let me know the exchange rate ? I'm hesitant to use cc coz I want to use youtrip instead to avoid the ""poor"" exchange rate and the 3% charge. I'm leaving on Monday.",btohqsg
PPV for contactless and DBS Altitude,btohqsg

Hi guys  asking for sincere advice 🫶🏽Planning to buy iPhone 16PM  and I do have couple of CCs with me.1) CRMC + Amaze2) UOB Lady’s Solitaire3) UOB EVOL4) SC SMART5) HSBC RevoIf you were me  what will you do the maximise the credit card miles/cashback reward?Sorry if the question sounded silly but sincerely looking for an answer 🤍 peace ✌🏽,btohqsg
Use Citi SMRT card if buying online . The rebate is capped at $600 annually so it’s best for doing a 1 time purchase online for large amount. Other cards like CRmC and revolution the rewards are capped after 1k,btohqsg
Not sure is this relevant to you. Video from Chris  Honey moneyhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/232461,btohqsg
Go down to store and tell them to split payments on different cc,btohqsg
That’s what I am planning to do  but with CRMC + Amaze only capped at $1000. Therefore  I am looking for an alternative cards to cover the rest of the spending 🥺,btohqsg
