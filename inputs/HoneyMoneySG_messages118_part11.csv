How about 2.4mpd fcy? Will u take this or use youtrip,btohqsg
Anyway those looking to register for Jul24 EGA BI  take note to do it after 9am tomorrow.,btohqsg
2.4mpd at 3.25% bank fee will work out 1.35 cents per mile. See your own value of miles and decide if its worth it.,btohqsg
Will be funding only on/after 3rd July into Jul24 promo EGA account.Just to be safe. Since last month June only withdrawed by 3rd June due to weekends.,btohqsg
Putting into eSaver for 1st - 3rd July holding first. Will still earn interest.,btohqsg
I started my investing into US ETF (VOO) 3 months back using syfe. Currently my holdings are around 2k SGD.I just found out that there's a 30% witholding tax for my dividends. Should I change to a Ireland ETF like CYPX with IBKR early with 15% tax or I should just stick to VOO?Please advice üôè,btohqsg
2.4mpd x 1.5 cents value - 4% fee = negative 0.4% benefitYouTrip better.,btohqsg
Hi guys  can we transfer krisflyer miles from one person to another (example husband to wife)?,btohqsg
Ya. Cso sick of people asking why the SMS acknowledge last month,btohqsg
Remember last round the SMS also send wrong text,btohqsg
Not 3.25% bank fee only. It‚Äôs 4% total fx charge if fight with YouTrip,btohqsg
Sorry im trying to do the calculation. Do u have a sample with real numbers to look at?,btohqsg
Which is also why I rather hold in e saver last few days of the month instead of withdraw EGA on first few days of the month.,btohqsg
Just use a fake $100 transaction and u can see the logic,btohqsg
Hi noob question does the citireward card mpd applies for shopee transactions? :),btohqsg
Really ? No lock in period for 30 days? They ll give proper rated  I guess,btohqsg
It‚Äôs calculated based on Daily Average Balances. So you earn for each day.,btohqsg
I am in the same boat  opened esaver 4th June but emptied HSBC same day so I better continue all July with SC ( i got pro rated 26 days of June interest and the ampaign is for 2 months at 3.5 roughly) then use EGA for August,btohqsg
0.75% fx spread is very generous of UOB eh. I thought it'll be 1.75% fx spread.,btohqsg
Can I move 22 K now to DBS to earn the 1.9% out of 50 K there ( currently have 27 there) then move after midnight to SC Esaver   worst case todays average get lower,btohqsg
Usually it is 3.25% bank fee and 0.8% master/visa/amex spread.The actual master/visa/amex spread observed depends on how fast they adjust their spread and how fast spot rate is moving.,btohqsg
Sorry don‚Äôt understand your question. üòÇ maybe can ask others to help.,btohqsg
Trying to verify 4% difference between youtrip and bank cc. Most of the online articles results are closer to 3% difference than 4%.,btohqsg
no  transfer on Sunday will be dated on Monday,btohqsg
Wrong. If you keep 100k for only 3 days in Jul  your ADB for Jul is 9677. But you will still earn the daily interest  not the full bonus interest for 100k incremental ADB.,btohqsg
Actually mab and adb concept usually ends up with same interest amountExceptFor situations where they cap max adb or mab for interest calculations. Very rare I think only one bank did that.,btohqsg
Anyone able to set up giro on HSBC EGA for DBS car loan? I'm able to find the giro form for credit cards only.,btohqsg
Bank fee will be 3.25-3.5 generally liao so 4 percent difference not too far off,btohqsg
Yes  but OP said he will leave funds in from 1 to 3 Jul  then withdraw the funds from the account.,btohqsg
Yes he will still get the 3.xx% pa interest for the 3 days in e saver.Which works out to be the same as 3.xx% pa x the mab of the esaver.,btohqsg
How come won‚Äôt earn the bonus interest for incremental ADB?SCB eSaver,btohqsg
Because those articles use fx spread of 3.25%.There were lengthy arguments both ways in milelion chat and I hope we don‚Äôt have to repeat it here. lol.TLDR: both sides have their points. Up to u which view u wanna adopt.,btohqsg
His adb for the reference month for esaver could be $1,btohqsg
Yup. That was what happened with eSaver.Account was totally emptied since 6th Jun 2024.But gets bonus 3.xx% & base 0.05%?,btohqsg
Will earn  but not the full incremental ADB. Meaning only 9677 and not 100k as stated above.But like what Mt said  ADB/MAB calculations are similar. Divide by 365 lo.,btohqsg
3.25% is 1% visa/master fee and 2.25% bank admin fee though.,btohqsg
0.05% should be from previous month or reference month to be correct,btohqsg
July mab will be compared with June mab.And incremental gets paid 3.xx% Loh.Not entire mab(This is standard promo).If u got exclusive invite promo refer to that tnc. Might have difference reference month.,btohqsg
3.xx Increment compared to that reference,btohqsg
I'm checking some articles when they used youtrip vs bank cc and compared. And result is bank cc is 3% more than youtrip.,btohqsg
Not possible to have this. Which bank?,btohqsg
Why not the full incremental? Previous month is always $0,btohqsg
Really depend on bank and payment gateway,btohqsg
Usually is 3.25% bank fee + 1% fx spread no?,btohqsg
CSPX or SPYL is a better option especially with IBKRReferhttps://youtu.be/wkA5FCaS-JE?si=hEzFHsYsfyrnKUz8,btohqsg
They play with words.It is 3.25% total card charge and 0.8% visa master Amex markup.They just breaking the 3.25%Into 2.25 bank + 1% visa master Amex feeStill have the 0.8% fx markup.,btohqsg
Hi all  for first time credit card application to ocbc and just received first salary (fresh grad)  how to submit documents (pay slip) to ocbc? Ps applied through singsaver,btohqsg
Wah seems like SCB also have this? Then it means they can‚Äôt enforced this 30 days period at all?Brain fried already.,btohqsg
This is not related. Just that keeping 100k for 3 days in Jul is akin to only receiving 100k / 365 days √ó 3 days worth of bonus interest.,btohqsg
best is invitation  no need worry about incremental.,btohqsg
