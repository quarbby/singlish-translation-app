Pika World Flash Update: Equity market saw a reversal turn as investors digest the new set of CPI data in good faith. We have caught on the wrong boat and had positions on both isles and our net positions on shorts may incur a hefty loss close to 5 digits. It reminds Pika Nat not to deviate from our trading rules on trading during big events especially when our options will expire the next day and will till the tail end.However  due to greed  we have executed numerous trade and caught on the wrong tide. It is a painful lesson and we are re-calibrating our portfolio again back to square 1. Tiring  but that's a learning lesson and Pika Nat hopes you can learn from the insights too.Our shorts positions continued to be in dangerous zone as we will have Retail sales data and the earnings of the bank before the bell strikes.We hope you have a good weekend too as Pika Nat takes a breather and unwind our positions. Cheers!,btohqsg

Today many counters will open higher   I believe today very opportunistic day . The better traders and BBs will come to scoop. Usually retailers lose because most join too late.9am onwards have to take risk if you want to do well with yesterdays global reversal first key of market sentiments improvement . Stay ready to strike,btohqsg
