Its defi something related to gas pedal and gear,btohqsg
just cos he not driving manual,btohqsg
But maybe its just 1.6 civic thing,btohqsg
I need drive some other 1.6 civic and see,btohqsg
let me try drive next time,btohqsg
since i drive my mom's one before,btohqsg
car stock wont have ECU problem,btohqsg
you tune or got piggyback then maybe,btohqsg
Hit 1.4k then hesitate whole car vibrate,btohqsg
Ur spark plugs gt gap properly?,btohqsg
Until i changed spark plugs n gapped them to 0.023,btohqsg
Cause prev owner really 90k mileage 3 years +,btohqsg
They renew my license first then i renew,btohqsg
I had this issue  but your car and mine the tech worlds apart,btohqsg
Aiya u guys drive one day and see,btohqsg
I explain to workshops and honda until i give up,btohqsg
Having a lufi is stupid to begin with,btohqsg
I got a feeling my car got hesitation every once in awhile,btohqsg
I'll get proper gauges eventually cos it doesn't read oil temp now,btohqsg
Your car needs old school defi,btohqsg
i dont want those round gauges tho,btohqsg
Lufi just reads what the obd says,btohqsg
coming from someone who wanna delete power steering wut....,btohqsg
old sch round round gauges nice leh haha,btohqsg
Put a Bluetooth obd and install torque,btohqsg
round gauges will have alot of wirings,btohqsg
i dont wanna drill holes in the dash,btohqsg
Mine are sticked on the top of the wind screen... But I don't think that option works for you,btohqsg
Honda remove my lufi all try to accelerate also thoughhhhh,btohqsg
It's like peeking through a cardboard box like solid snake,btohqsg
Came with the car that way so I left it as that,btohqsg
Oil 80-100 ideal  but can push higher if driving hard,btohqsg
hot day normal driving 100 liao ;/,btohqsg
Your jerky problem at what speed?,btohqsg
Okay when i drove the civic 1.6na fc - i think there is a cvt lag,btohqsg
But mine is ard 50-70 i think,btohqsg
Wah no leh that one all clear for me,btohqsg
I think time to change to evo🤭,btohqsg
But only at certain that one thoughhhh,btohqsg
Ya because mine was one component of the throttle body,btohqsg
But I don't know if yours has a similar component to mine,btohqsg
Also a leaky exhaust can cause this,btohqsg
Idk let you all drive the experts and see,btohqsg
My revs would hesitate at low rpm and very jumpy... But if I step hard problem wasn't there,btohqsg
Turbo i heard also got some issue,btohqsg
Cannot too exp 15k diff just for turbo,btohqsg
Throttle body was the main culprit  for mine there's a valve that was stuck. Changed that and it improved a lot  changed my leaking exhaust and problem completely gone,btohqsg
But throttle body part i see how,btohqsg
Cause maybe got a lot of carbon buildup,btohqsg
One of the civic owner ask me go to de carbon and see how,btohqsg
My car idle at traffic goes up to 60%,btohqsg
Don't know if yours has that,btohqsg
Like on the lufi engine %,btohqsg
R u sure u have a lufi,btohqsg
idle  on aircon its normal for the rev's to drop a bit,btohqsg
voltage also should drop a little,btohqsg
Was wondering who today havent send picture,btohqsg
Time to get a lufi for your car hahahahaha,btohqsg
It doesnt have engine load parameters,btohqsg
I dreamt of someone gifting me a lufi. Then I woke up. And now I see lufi first thing here. Jesussssss,btohqsg
Wait... What does the engine % means?,btohqsg
I'm getting my lufi up this Saturday,btohqsg
It says engine L % which sounds like engine load,btohqsg
buy liao put at home first,btohqsg
Well if aircon can load until 60% is quite scary haha,btohqsg
I tell you   buy the wheel and throttle and lufiThan buy racing game at home play can liao,btohqsg
lufi can’t use on swift also 😂,btohqsg
Wah this Sunday got car meet.,btohqsg
I think organizer might be a young kid,btohqsg
First picked family day afternoon at a carpark with no amenities,btohqsg
He is in this group lol,btohqsg
I heard they are mainly spotters.,btohqsg
now organising meets is the trend,btohqsg
Too many meets all after covid excited,btohqsg
Car owners very chuan. So Many meets to go,btohqsg
Must be like me. Host weird weird meets then fun. :3,btohqsg
If it can be i park go brunch and chloe go attend i dont mind,btohqsg
our ages got range ah   some 21+ some young,btohqsg
at first they say they want host at semb park so i jst agree now i myself need handle 😭 the rest all silent,btohqsg
Nothing wrong with young just that… it wont occur to you about family day and stuff,btohqsg
last time cars & kopi was like every 2nd Sunday of the month or something like that,btohqsg
now i need decide if sat or sun then host 😭,btohqsg
Yea true. Organising a huge meet need a lot to consider. If not i also won't take months to finally come up with a meet.,btohqsg
The cars and coffee formula works because family can involve which means the father or mother who is the driver wont get in trouble with spouse,btohqsg
Abandon spouse and kid on sunday daytime to go car meet. That is a cost that cannot be counted,btohqsg
thanks for the info bro  i’ll discuss with the other organisers,btohqsg
yall think sunday or sat better?,btohqsg
or jst postpone to next next weekend,btohqsg
No correct answer here. Every individual got plans,btohqsg
anyday for me so long advance say i can plan,btohqsg
In my case saturday got my kid’s classes,btohqsg
Meets mostly on Friday or Sat night better. Because Sunday is family day. If night  Monday ppl got work.,btohqsg
and the cars and owners that turn up at cars & kopi are a different crowd. more matured owners. less havoc.,btohqsg
Daytime is always tricky. So again it boils down to having it at a place where ppl can also do stuff,btohqsg
Honestly i feel that car meets are about making new friends and meeting friends,btohqsg
Like if u did it at ecp. The wife and kids can go macs or playground,btohqsg
But if spotters start to host,btohqsg
I feel like car meet is better from 7 PM onwards or sum,btohqsg
Kinda feel like an excuse for spotters to gather all the cool cars to take photos,btohqsg
They host doesn't mean we should go,btohqsg
What happened to taking photos of girls,btohqsg
defeats the meaning of spotter already,btohqsg
I ended up only 10:30 reach sia,btohqsg
Okay guys enough liao. Political issues  let's not discuss other groups how they organise their meets here. Not nice. Give a bit advise is good enough.,btohqsg
Makan and then drop family at home and head out,btohqsg
Photographers would pay a model and take photos,btohqsg
My wife don't even allow me to attend car meetsNeed to ask permission firstKeep ask me make baby so i won't go for car meetsHELP 😭,btohqsg
Don't know if they still do that,btohqsg
we help you write appeal letter,btohqsg
for you to attend meet up with us hahaha,btohqsg
Ur wife need become sister with me alr then.,btohqsg
He give spa package then can come out,btohqsg
Nowadays the girls let u take meh. Their revenue stream leh.,btohqsg
They take picture of themselves and post to earn the advertising money,btohqsg
I make friends with a lot of car owners gf here. They from dont their bf mod car become okay with it alr.,btohqsg
Maybe he should Intro the wife to you,btohqsg
My gf buy mods for me,btohqsg
whatever you're planning  just go ahead with it. then you'll see for yourself which days and times work best. there's no correct answer.,btohqsg
I see the wife a few times alr. Just never talk much. Cause i didn't know he needed it. HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
