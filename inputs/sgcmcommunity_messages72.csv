i always check the tyre before i move off,btohqsg
Just make sure to do a Pre Purchase Inspection next time! With BMWs more things to check for that may not have been maintained!,btohqsg
Pressures can only check with an inflator,btohqsg
But just need to make sure the unit you get maintained well,btohqsg
one thing about elantra is that it will alert me if there's any issue,btohqsg
All the lights and symbols are common on all cars,btohqsg
Just the newer cars have a Multi Information Display (MID) that will give you a description of the issue as well,btohqsg
My kia never come out before sia,btohqsg
Maybe because I never whack the car before,btohqsg
Can also get something small like thisSerene,btohqsg
Tire Pressure monitoring system so that you can monitor,btohqsg
And also if you know how  can’t go wrong with checking your dip stick once in a while,btohqsg
There's different ones on the market with different pricing,btohqsg
If you have a manual one that is  many cars now have electronic dipstick also,btohqsg
Have I been living under a rock,btohqsg
You have been living with VTEC,btohqsg

"Spotted a x6""m"" today. Member here?",btohqsg
Apparently you must kneel and beg to know it's him,btohqsg
"I thought with the ""m"" badge it must be him",btohqsg
The more i read the messages  the more i think he talks like someone i know,btohqsg
Oh! Maybe you know him then,btohqsg
Look around your friend group for people with BMW+Merc who would claim their have an x6m 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Hahaha unfortunately i know no such person  but this guy clearly doesnt drive any of those,btohqsg
But there's definitely more people like Mr Se in this world,btohqsg
The other half as I like to describe them,btohqsg
LOL the other night u said the other half are iphone users  same half? HAHA,btohqsg
I would say there are many halves in the world,btohqsg
Possible  that's why ready to be back after getting banned on 2 accounts already,btohqsg
nissan and pete are deleted tho,btohqsg
Could be the very same person for all we know,btohqsg
Ok but we do interact with him too,btohqsg
must see if the fella uses,btohqsg
Seems like it  but a lot more vulgar,btohqsg
But there is censor here anyway,btohqsg
Many times his messages get deleted,btohqsg
Plus he's more cautious after being banned the last few times,btohqsg
Anyway  I like the petrol head discussions here more,btohqsg
So don't mind putting up with Se,btohqsg
Anyway  early night for me today.,btohqsg

Huh what. Sorry just got out of office,btohqsg
Problem is all ev are gonna be performance car soon,btohqsg
As too easy to have good handling due to placement of battery and awd and good acceleration,btohqsg
Another 5 years u see ev easily do below 2 second century sprint at a low price,btohqsg
Maybe for a bus also can,btohqsg
Then the question is what is a performance car my bus can go faster,btohqsg
Something wrong with the link? The article displayed is Subaru BRZ,btohqsg
Hahaha the link goes to Subaru BRZ.,btohqsg
Yup that's the characteristics of ev,btohqsg

the car not even fast put bbk for what😂😂,btohqsg
cos if the fella heavy foot,btohqsg
like tailgate people with pony power,btohqsg
Bbk is for safety not for fast car,btohqsg
at least can stop before ruining other lives,btohqsg
yes at least bbk can save other lives,btohqsg
This what ppl say when they wana use performancr break on slow cars,btohqsg
Well  people think bbk instantly boosts braking power but that's not how it works,btohqsg
Yep agree. Helps alot with braking and can save ur life from idiots / cyclist / suddenly dash out pedestrian,btohqsg
i think most people underestimate their stock brake😂😂,btohqsg
Bbk can actually worsen your braking in some cases,btohqsg
BBK and Stock brake have the same stopping distance...,btohqsg
BBK is just to prevent brake fade when u go on track,btohqsg
Diff type of cars have diff type of brake,btohqsg
will watch this ltr  thanks for sharing,btohqsg
But this is the primary purpose,btohqsg
Why stop at Cayman? Go for RR liao,btohqsg
I listen to my mummy too,btohqsg
dont fight ppl w poor taste,btohqsg

Rendang also use alot of oil,btohqsg
LOL u try put rendang oil inside lor,btohqsg
Not brrraaaaaaaaa (when VTEC kicks in) meh,btohqsg

nice  you are department free  now all in one issit?,btohqsg
That will be a good perk,btohqsg
The level of evidence u guys have. Catn believe u all keep all these lol,btohqsg
I think he just searched and took that,btohqsg
As long as you are dedicated enough to search through keywords,btohqsg
When these 3 errors appear together  it usually only means a few things. Wheel speed sensors  wheel hub or abs module,btohqsg
When a workshop does a deeper scan  it might be able to find the exact fault,btohqsg
ECU failure won't be so forgiving with just 3 codes,btohqsg
i have good memory  dont like people to bl0w cows,btohqsg
Unless u get a bigger rotor and caliper,btohqsg
If you you remember a few words that the person said in their message,btohqsg
Just need to scroll a bit,btohqsg
only if u do it repeatedly,btohqsg
a 1 time braking  stock brakes will be the same,btohqsg
either way u will lock up w shitty tyres,btohqsg
the thing tht matter is tyres,btohqsg
tyres is what touches the road,btohqsg
Ecu very unlikely but cant be ruled out. Wheel speed sensors are not expensive and can breakdown due to age,btohqsg
Wheel hubs can sometimes be damaged due to pot holes or whatever  but still relatively cheap fix,btohqsg
Vw cars have a bad rep for the abs module,btohqsg
i am suspect abs module too,btohqsg
But a deep scan at a workshop should be able to give better overview,btohqsg
Parts if want cheaper can buy from stockists but not everywhere allows bring your own parts.,btohqsg
only one way to find out,btohqsg
the brake is already strong enough to grip the caliper,btohqsg
True but the tyre maybe could take more brake pressure without locking?,btohqsg
when u experience brake fade the brake and caliper will slip,btohqsg
it is helpful tht bbk improve brake modulation,btohqsg
I on stock brakes but not something im willing to try lol,btohqsg
but if we are speaking without driver error or human error side  theoratically its the same,btohqsg
4pot usually still 2 equal pistons,btohqsg
If 4 and single large piston maybe no effect braking distance,btohqsg
Most bbks don't improve braking outright bur at high temps will be better with lesser brake fade,btohqsg
But yes many people put in a bbk and feel the difference  usually placebo,btohqsg
Need a jack and a few tools,btohqsg
^ because after changing need to check functionality too,btohqsg
U can also get a obd reader yourself,btohqsg
For that  normal obd reader won't do it I think  need the VAG specific full software,btohqsg
Get a bluetooth obd2 adapter and a reader app for vw,btohqsg
Yupp  will be useful to diagnose faults and clear codes,btohqsg
Can also unlock features at times,btohqsg
Im out of vw scene for a long time  i dont know what apps anymore,btohqsg
But not sure what to get,btohqsg
I think car scanner is pretty inclusive,btohqsg
unless u got tools to reset the ecu etc,btohqsg
Shopee  ebay have. Cheap one maybe $10 or less. But may not be compatible with the app. Expensvie one maybe 60 to 80,btohqsg
Elm327 obd2 reader. With bluetooth or wifi.,btohqsg
Preferably Bluetooth  more apps using Bluetooth now,btohqsg
Find a free one that u like or able to scan. Then purchase if necessary,btohqsg

This is a good free one,btohqsg
I use this! Very good stuff,btohqsg
Sounds like you had the same issue before on your m3 sir? Yeah my guess would be the same too. Does sound like speed sensing related.  I’m guessing speed sensor troubleshoot (for god’s sake don’t let the workshop tell you troubleshoot means change ALL FOUR immediately but really find out which one failed. Switch sides to test). If still have  then I suspect wheel bearing le.,btohqsg

I scheduled for coating already sia cries,btohqsg
Can still cost mah. Rest of car still benefits,btohqsg
I think maybe I was in a great mood so i forgive but never forget 😖😖,btohqsg
Did the person offer to make good?,btohqsg
I think back now like abit regret LOL,btohqsg
You go ask your mummy like that correct or not,btohqsg
She sure say son… forgive must forget then is real forgiveness,btohqsg
Such wise words in the morning,btohqsg
It was an old man lah so I like abit ps want ask him claim,btohqsg
So if you hit my car I will forgive,btohqsg
Got before people opened into my rickshaw. One an old man. Another a small kid,btohqsg
I thought you say you old,btohqsg
I can offer to make good but I only have $13.40 in my piggy bank 🏦,btohqsg

Ya sometimes the wheel speed sensors also just needs a bit of cleaning,btohqsg
Mr Se confirm will not say sorry. He will check whether u supposed to be there in the first place,btohqsg
Guys  should I follow my car notification to go servicing or follow the card given?,btohqsg
My car is hitting 20k km soon  and car is asking me to go for servicing. However I have a card stated from previous owner that says next servicing is on October,btohqsg
If u can disable the annoying notifications  follow the card records,btohqsg
Then when u go for Oct servicing  they reset the warning again for u,btohqsg
