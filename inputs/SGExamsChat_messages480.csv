For my family we try to avoid nursing home until he cannot walk  before alr dementia and everything  but once can’t walk that’s it,btohqsg
Once he die tbh I feel almost relived cause every time go hospital is probably suffering,btohqsg
Since SAF i can only sleep in one specific spot,btohqsg

I heard that in the glory days of 2010 and before they used to have like 4 or 5 ppl on ready for any adhoc detail,btohqsg
Sit in the office and do admin or disturb other ppl,btohqsg
Nowadays the office empty except for one clerk,btohqsg
By right ah if war declared supposed to ferry these spare ppl to requisition all civilian vehicles who are in the plan to support the war effort,btohqsg
But nowadays I suppose they will hope the NSmen will come back in time LOL,btohqsg

All the rabak ppl probably ooc or posted to some other place,btohqsg
Can’t risk them Siam the course for driver,btohqsg
The driver course is psychological torture course,btohqsg
Legit can make me cry lmao,btohqsg
I rmb when I went back the profile of the nsf was quite well educated,btohqsg
Very diff from all the Paikia I saw ord,btohqsg
That one is just the test la,btohqsg
The whole way the instructors have some legit mental issue,btohqsg
One second happy one sad angry,btohqsg
You make any mistake start shouting and throwing shit,btohqsg
I’m fucking driving a truck bro settle down,btohqsg

If I gonna drive now I will ocd check all my mirrors everyone seatbelt on make sure I stop when yellow before move off look literally out of the window  our hand out of the window,btohqsg
I guess maybe my instructor is especially fucked up,btohqsg
He got some mental issues for sure,btohqsg
Should have told him don’t make your problem my problem,btohqsg
Funny thing about that guy is I kenna drill until I drive to perfection ah  I can drive the manual all smooth like butter,btohqsg

Drive above your standard big fuck,btohqsg
Another famous one is fuck spider  I can’t go a single day without hearing this phrase,btohqsg
I trauma bond with a other friend from jc,btohqsg
Even 10 years later we can laugh when some stupid shit happen,btohqsg
I just need to scream fuck spider,btohqsg
We both can laugh like mad sia,btohqsg
They got some incentive if you pass within n tries,btohqsg
I legit will never choose to drive again unless saf force me,btohqsg
It activates my OCD to have to drive,btohqsg
I got the strategy consulting interview,btohqsg
Last time I told him just smoke only,btohqsg
Time to bcome an angry burnout at 22,btohqsg

I finish burnout two years ago alr  now just finding some hidden strength,btohqsg
But a lot of nsf got attitude problem play mc,btohqsg
Then you are like a decent guy want to do the right thing,btohqsg
You have to tank so much shut,btohqsg
Nowadays at work learn to have a backbone and Siam problem,btohqsg
pretty much gotta ooc from driving because of that lmao,btohqsg
Oh they change driving course to stay in is it,btohqsg
Cos my time can stay out is the only reason why never OOC,btohqsg
Even every day need to see this mental guy can tahan for the sake of leaving at 1830,btohqsg
Go home can enjoy own bed own shower wah,btohqsg
But in the end I not sure if worth LOL  quite sure I have some serious ocd triggers now. When stressed I feel damn itchy everywhere,btohqsg
Does a van drive over with the newly made bread or smth,btohqsg
Or they can march in and secure their own,btohqsg
Or is it got special driver detail,btohqsg
Pte TO  your orders is to acquire the daily bread and report to cookhouse  depart 0630  return at 0800  dismissed,btohqsg
This detail sound quite nice sia,btohqsg
Much better than 2359 drive for 1 hour along a unlit forest,btohqsg
Have the officer keep talking about how this used to be graveyard,btohqsg
I think he bored la  quite sure Plab was never graveyard,btohqsg
But like it’s not the whole place,btohqsg
Oh I used to be sch 4,btohqsg
We got ask each other wtf is that afterwords,btohqsg
Then they make some excuse like oh the Malaysia side got mosque,btohqsg
But to me like abit weird to hear so clear eh?,btohqsg

Anyway the intake is shrinking so probably best to just reorganize that coy and move them to other coy,btohqsg
Actually during my time alr got similar story but not death of a person,btohqsg
But basically that we are in a dirty place,btohqsg
That’s why don’t go the floor above us,btohqsg
How can we tell if we welfare one lol,btohqsg
Make us run make us all out make us knock it down,btohqsg
Maybe later Change but I don’t rmb this is very welfare leh,btohqsg

Maybe they change it ba but I was there in 2014,btohqsg
But usually there is a reason why,btohqsg
Like that coy is all pes c,btohqsg
Anyway sch 4 is punishment enough,btohqsg
Every time first in last out,btohqsg

That’s why ask women serve NS la then we don’t need all this bravado shit,btohqsg
Women more sensible than men in some area,btohqsg
Have them then we don’t need so ego,btohqsg
Every time must wayang every time must suffer needlessly,btohqsg
You know the medics idk why but everyone who report sick need to IV,btohqsg

But the parade square ground is too hot,btohqsg
Aiya all this ego shit only works cause you’re all recruit,btohqsg
Nsmen don’t give a shit about this,btohqsg
In front of women then whatever Lor,btohqsg
The worst parts are the physical and psych damage lol  all the ego shit probably good for maturity,btohqsg
Now still back pain but my ego is healthy  so….,btohqsg
Isn't material science quite niche in sg abit hard no?,btohqsg
I never hear until so deep ba,btohqsg
Last time if can get by without rashes or feeling depressed is a win liao,btohqsg
Dunno why nowadays y’all can hear until so drama,btohqsg
If wan pursue career probably best go overseas tho,btohqsg
I think it’s good we no social media last time  or at least not s many ppl using it,btohqsg
Wah but shit if I knew can report ppl for abuse of power I will report gao gao lol,btohqsg
Report MO force ppl to get IV and suffer and never dispense medicine,btohqsg
Report ppl make everyone everything on everything off,btohqsg
Then ppl throw shit at you can report,btohqsg
Pr almost same but can hold other country passport,btohqsg
Become citizen need give up Malaysia passport liao,btohqsg
You wrong race is it bro,btohqsg
If got war here can fuck off to there Lor,btohqsg
So you just need abuse 3-1,btohqsg
You still pay income tax to Malaysia govt?,btohqsg
If you end up stay in Malaysia when retire,btohqsg
Sch fee is just 10k 20k,btohqsg
Singaporean cannot buy Malaysia property nowadays,btohqsg
I also don’t get all of this,btohqsg
The free money n stuff is new,btohqsg
Wah nowadays make Reddit post can improve Ns?,btohqsg
Last time we hear got ns hotline but didn’t know the number so in the end everyone just tahan,btohqsg
We got threatened to only rate cookhouse good,btohqsg
They will watch us make sure we put the smiley face,btohqsg
Lol got even more fucked up shit before us we consider ourself very lucky liao,btohqsg
During driving course I heard can book out every day I thought I was the luckiest nsf alive,btohqsg
Didn’t know got such thing as clerk,btohqsg
Every day come back psych resilience course and driving course,btohqsg
But it’s ok cos can book out at 1830,btohqsg
I thought nowadays is more advanced,btohqsg
I mean ok the govt no hope but job and the facilities improved right,btohqsg
i always slept for at least 6h everyday,btohqsg
if u sleep that short something is wrong with you 🗿,btohqsg
Anyway I welcome all Malaysian who wanna be better in sg  you’re all our brother and sister,btohqsg
Unless y’all try to Siam NS or try cheat the system then go back Malaysia do that,btohqsg
Anyway you should consider if you don’t get citizenship just apply for other country citizenship if you can make it,btohqsg
If you alr choose Singapore then I guess welcome,btohqsg
But if I were you maybe pick Australia lol,btohqsg
You didn’t need to serve Mah,btohqsg
You can Siam and study in aus and get their Pr,btohqsg
If cannot then just renounce and hide in Malaysia,btohqsg
Come work here on Epass basis,btohqsg
I’m just saying that if you played your card right can Siam one,btohqsg
But you are those legit ppl,btohqsg
Lol your mum not the one doing NS,btohqsg
Why they apply pr for you in the first place,btohqsg
Not like very hard to get PR even after ns age,btohqsg
Either you do after ns age and become PR  or you citizen all the way,btohqsg
Idk why they do this half and half very weird,btohqsg
Anw you born here why you not citizen?,btohqsg
Your parents a bit dumb la,btohqsg
Now you got some headaches cos of this weird scenario,btohqsg
If you gonna born here study here do ns here,btohqsg
If you wanna Siam ns and be pr why not just not apply then Siam then apply PR when you after ns age,btohqsg
Don’t do this oh I wanna be pr and do ns,btohqsg
Tell them you will bleed for the nation  but they keep deny your citizenship,btohqsg
A lot of non ns serving pr also become citizen,btohqsg
So for you I think no problem,btohqsg
Anyway I’m glad Ns now not so rabak,btohqsg
If I did ns in 2004 maybe im the ghost you will hear about,btohqsg
2014 I alr think Fd up,btohqsg
Can’t imagine 1994 or 1984 ns,btohqsg
Is it? Wah sounds good sia,btohqsg
I think social media have a big part to play,btohqsg
Nowadays if you not happy just do some TikTok exposure,btohqsg
Whole nation will ask how come defense spend so high but food so shit,btohqsg
Before all this I think no unified voices,btohqsg
If it’s up to me I will ask why defense spending higher than healthcare and nsf pay still so low,btohqsg
I will also ask why threaten ppl to rate good? If it’s not good why have rating system,btohqsg
I mean I believe that defense important so that’s why treat people fairly lol,btohqsg
If not next time got war at most ppl will post thoughts and prayers after they run away,btohqsg
If you treat ppl fairly they will die for the nation,btohqsg
If you treat like shit ppl will chao keng and run,btohqsg
In unit I felt treated fairly (relative to BMT and training sch) so I quite happy to do sai kang,btohqsg
Eh I don’t care la  not my job to fix saf. If war come and the population not loyal they only have themselves to blame,btohqsg
Whole life and career dedicated to saf still can’t win loyalty,btohqsg
If you treat ppl fair they will join and serve well,btohqsg
You force ppl and threaten and abuse them they sure sabo one,btohqsg
This one is the nsf replacement issue lol,btohqsg
No more children is another Singaporean protest hahaha,btohqsg
Can import ppl but can’t import soldiers,btohqsg
I honestly wish it wasn’t like this but since government can’t fix then we have to make do with this reality Lor,btohqsg
train soldiers just for them to ck,btohqsg
I bet if we rly go and investigate all the abuses in SAF from when it started to now  the jail will be full,btohqsg
This one need go to those forum to read but no credible sources leh,btohqsg
Lol idk why must classify sia,btohqsg
Death is one thing la but how about all the physical mental sexual emotional damage lol  that one probably not documented,btohqsg
Special forces is special force la,btohqsg
The rest is no one ask to be part of it then subject to all of this it’s quite sad,btohqsg
How did the guy get buried alive,btohqsg
Like legit how did he get buried alive in a fox hole,btohqsg
Ppl fill up the hole he remain asleep,btohqsg
No one bother to just look inside,btohqsg
Plus you fill up foxhole take a lot of effort and make sound,btohqsg
Never feel dirt slowly fall on him,btohqsg
The buddy never realize eh wtf where is he and see them putting dirt on him,btohqsg
This one is like wtf happened sia,btohqsg
The guy too tired until sleep never wake up  heart attack or got knocked out or what,btohqsg
I honestly can’t imagine that ppl filled up a hole,btohqsg
Without noticing someone was in it,btohqsg
Like even shag cannot think I have to swing the changkol will for sure see someone’s inside liao,btohqsg
Unless they literally never see the hole just walk around the mound of dirt,btohqsg
Then push at the dirt pile nonstop never check,btohqsg
And even then the guy inside never wake up ah,btohqsg
They so efficient at filling up hole one,btohqsg
So fast that he never even wake up?,btohqsg
I went to see the Wikipedia page and Wah 2008 2012 damn Lot of deaths sia,btohqsg
In a morbid twisted way it’s good that I serve in 2014  they still high alert cause only one year or two year ago got deaths,btohqsg
You read all the case file when you bored ah lol wth,btohqsg
I hear all the road accident I too scared to drive liao,btohqsg
Yeah I mean got guards do night parachute at plab then we need to be there to send them hospital or triage I got see before,btohqsg
But this one is like ok la it’s parachute or night jump or whatever,btohqsg
Whoever la idk if it’s parachute or rappel,btohqsg
Cause they fall into a drain or ditch or something,btohqsg
But they came in with broken leg or some shit injured in the legs,btohqsg
Then we call their camp ambulance come cos we not here to use our ppl to help them,btohqsg
Can bring them back to medical center but cant bring them to hospital,btohqsg
All these high risk activity if you ask me should be paid regular pay,btohqsg
You can’t psycho me to do any of this nowadays,btohqsg
When you are 18 you think ur invincible,btohqsg
I now 27 I everything scared lol,btohqsg
Oh yeah I rmb I got a fucked up incident,btohqsg
Then a bit high cause fever,btohqsg
The MO gave me light duty when high fever,btohqsg
Then next day can’t eat anything and drink anything,btohqsg
Then i can’t rmb what happen I think it was Saturday,btohqsg
But yeah from then on I don’t rly trust SAF,btohqsg
And they treat you in a fucked up way if you nsf go hospital also,btohqsg
Tbh now I’m starting to rmb it I also don’t want to think so much liao,btohqsg
Later just angry for the whole week,btohqsg
Idk but I think cause I was a bit high he assumed I’m ok,btohqsg
But yeah now I think about it wow that was fucked up,btohqsg
If I think hard enough I will rmb a lot more fucked up shit but not worth to think too much ba,btohqsg

Wah how would you know the limit sia,btohqsg
In a weird way I would say this shows fighting spirit  just that u fighting for the wrong thing lol,btohqsg
Oh scdf and spf fucked up for sure,btohqsg
But depends on where they are in,btohqsg
Some are ok some are fucked,btohqsg
Kaki bukit no one has nice things to say about it,btohqsg
Mc as in at home la,btohqsg
Ya that’s what I mean la  if you use your mc it’s like your shield is reduced,btohqsg
Then when it comes time to decide smth,btohqsg
They will see all the numbers and pick the lowest one,btohqsg

You want can go camping on Ubin and roll in the mud,btohqsg
Get bitten by 100 diff insects,btohqsg
Then any skin disease you have afterwards don’t take mc,btohqsg
In fact I think skip the whole going out part,btohqsg
Don’t shower for 5 days and don’t turn on aircon or fan,btohqsg
They need to dig the earth nonstop,btohqsg
And that’s actually one of the worst parts,btohqsg
Save your energy and time to get ahead in uni,btohqsg
Or just enjoy the two years,btohqsg
They get the survival course need to eat random shit  more outfield  and honestly bro no one cares your ocs singlet,btohqsg
University once the first few months trade ns story become about studying alr,btohqsg
Girls don’t care cause they can’t relate  at most they see your number 1 photo and sword abit cool,btohqsg
Guys don’t care cos if you officer they hate you if you cb and if you not cb you just their bro,btohqsg
And worst is if you get too psychoed by SAF and being an officer you become this almost Napoleon complex shithead who can’t see beyond army life,btohqsg
It doesn’t rly do anything for you unless you sign on,btohqsg
My own brother in law is a fighter pilot but eh humble as F,btohqsg
Beyond the first year no one cares in uni liao,btohqsg
Not worth the pain for reservist and nsf,btohqsg
Now if the pay is double maybe can say worth,btohqsg
But it’s so shit pay for so much more work don’t bother,btohqsg
That’s wrong bro  so many girls are into anime own,btohqsg
Maybe last time you play too much dota they not happy with u but like  even then I feel like the whole “too nerdy” thing is for those mid 30 and above,btohqsg
30s to 20s nowadays so many Japanese lovers and K-pop lovers and TikTok watchers and gamers,btohqsg
It’s not anything weird any more imo,btohqsg
I think that the people who shamed others for watching anime probably graduated before 2010 lol,btohqsg
I swear every girl I know either loves Japan or anime,btohqsg
And if it’s not they love Korea or K-pop,btohqsg
Ok to be fair maybe cause CS and IT,btohqsg
Guess maybe it is selection bias,btohqsg
But I feel at least half of all women watch anime if they’re under 30,btohqsg
I have watched like 3 animes in my life seriously and not just here and there when someone else is watching. death Note  avatar legend of aang  and haruhi suzumiya,btohqsg
And most of them I watch cos my friend watch lol,btohqsg
I think avatar was on TV,btohqsg
So no other cartoons watch that one  and it’s rly good imo,btohqsg
Death note super interesting story  I would watch even if it was a normal tv show,btohqsg
Haruhi suzumiya is actually incredible also from a story point of view but it went nowhere,btohqsg
Was hoping they would explain who she was,btohqsg
Avatar is like those kind of moral stories they tell children but they put real adult world and consequences in it  I like it a lot.,btohqsg
lol if you judge based on RP they clearly don’t know how different uni is,btohqsg
Oh I watched it here and there when ppl watch but I don’t know the story,btohqsg
Some schoolboy fights in robot suits or smth,btohqsg

Within a year they all drop this nonsense liao,btohqsg
