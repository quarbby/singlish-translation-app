On how many ppl pass and move on to where,btohqsg
And how many ppl did well,btohqsg
"nah i have like ""do you have people to reach out to""  word for word ""how stressed are you"" i think",btohqsg
Cannot be used to make a claim ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
wait so what exactly do you need,btohqsg
Ohh this i saw but not my age grp,btohqsg
A large number of students aged 6-18 are stressed,btohqsg
""" it iz what it iz""",btohqsg
"""approximate percentage of students aged 6-18 in singapore who are stressed by the education system"" i just put this in my search bar",btohqsg
fk lah ill js pretend stress doesn't exist,btohqsg
Best part this essay is on children health and obesity,btohqsg
Yes stress not a big part yes,btohqsg
I have a whole 6 marks to lose,btohqsg
if they want be anal and penalised me for inaccuracy,btohqsg
but if is nt related then,btohqsg

I alr getting fked in my opening line for the essay,btohqsg
Nah is orchard gateway and is old pic,btohqsg
They will argue anxiety and stress different,btohqsg
and there are studies that show anxiety and stress are linked,btohqsg
Im doing psychology bro u must be accurate,btohqsg
there's this entire document you can comb through too,btohqsg
Correlation no causation is what they say ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
you can find evidence of both in studies,btohqsg
have those lecturers never done research before lol,btohqsg
Thing is u can over assume ah,btohqsg
so if i want use the essay will drag on,btohqsg
everything must be researched/science and evidence based,btohqsg
how tf uw me explain brain neurochemical mechanism 6 diff times and be under 1.5k word limit,btohqsg
u see right i got 6 pts,btohqsg
a buttload of psychology research is based on surveys and tests that can easily be argued against,btohqsg
but that's why people do a ton of them,btohqsg
and we must explain chemical  neurological or some mechanisms,btohqsg
we don't even understand half the stuff about our brain LOL,btohqsg
no bruh this is not paper writing,btohqsg
and i need everything to be as up to date as possible,btohqsg
you know what's a stereotype of the arts vs sciences in research papers,btohqsg
O ya the research article i can use must be from 2013 onwards,btohqsg
for science: the abstract you understand but you spent hours understanding one equation in the actual thing,btohqsg
If not i get slapped with outdated or possibly inaccurate info,btohqsg
for arts: the abstract says nothing but the entire paper just goes in circles,btohqsg
im gonna fail my module at this rate,btohqsg
Combined they form 60% of my grade for the mod,btohqsg
Thank god the other 40% i basically got all 40% LOL,btohqsg
the fact you're in psychology but they expect you to conduct research as tho you're doing neurobiology,btohqsg
Must conduct research on social mechanism,btohqsg
conduct research on social mechanism in a physical science way,btohqsg
basically we must like explain smt like stress and like sci behind it,btohqsg
