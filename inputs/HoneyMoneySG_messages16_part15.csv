Couple of possible reason that I could think of such as track record with the bank. Example always sign up then cancel. Maybe income level not that high but alot credit card. Etc. I have had personal experience of being near perfect credit rating but took 1 month for my UOB credit card to approve after countless spamming on their hotline/email. Doesn't make sense.,btohqsg

I am annoyed that bcos of the delay  I become no longer the first xxx to apply for the CC and not get the extra miles,btohqsg
I have emailed them to rage about this but been one week. No reply. UOB customer service seems quite sucky in general. Their SLA all rubber band timing one.,btohqsg

Trust bank and Sc bank credit limits linked ?,btohqsg
Under offers  I don‚Äôt see the 50cents cashback banner anymore,btohqsg
New user to SC smart card. Their SC app did not statement or appear any due date for the bills. May I know is this common issue,btohqsg
Anyone know if the uob absolute CC also will have 1.7% if u use it for public transport?,btohqsg
I had the same issue  u can call them up and take note on the bill amount and date. In my case I paid then the bill appeared‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Good for ppl with excess cash and short duration :),btohqsg

I also loss $500 from ftx . Did not aware of the news until these few day,btohqsg
when it comes to crypto  u have to be rather on the ball with news esp during winter season bear times...,btohqsg
Those with money/coins inCrypto.com  please be extra careful as well. No centralized exchange is safe in this current sentiments,btohqsg
Uob tmrw app does give break down now,btohqsg
Uob $$$  should count toward the 600,btohqsg
This is for block for $5 dollar u get 2 miles  other miles card is 1.2 to 1.4 per dollar so $5 u get 6 miles or 7 miles,btohqsg

Dont think amex can be use for simply go unless u top to grab and use grab for simply go?,btohqsg
U can always send in application to try. Internal criteria of how the credit team approve is really case by case,btohqsg
sian sia i use their CRO card actively lol,btohqsg
More likely to be rejected since your credit score will be affected,btohqsg
If UOB  can apply. Anyway you‚Äôll be waiting maybe 6 months to get approvedüòÇ,btohqsg
Oh no.. that‚Äôs long üòÇ even though I have uob one card? Existing uob member,btohqsg
Nah I‚Äôm just kidding. But yeah they‚Äôre slow af. I have a UOB One  waiting for the CC application for 1.5 months alreadyüåö,btohqsg
Which means it‚Äôs a better off card somewhat even without the category spend eh?,btohqsg
Still mcc have to be not excluded,btohqsg
Quite confused in that. Means No MCC it‚Äôs shitty? Miles card is $1 = 1.4mileLady‚Äôs is $1=2miles but blocks of $5,btohqsg
