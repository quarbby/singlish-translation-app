I think if you speed up next to them instead of peacefully letting them by,btohqsg

I don‚Äôt tail gate ppl   ppl tail gate me,btohqsg
I think tail gating is very rude and dangerous,btohqsg
If want just over take them why tail gate,btohqsg
need more tender loving care than Jap... I change gear oil every 10k together with oil change..sfsg..n I dun whack. it's senior citizen liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
But I know some ppl get angry when the car deliberately slow down so to block them from overtaking,btohqsg
I seen a lot of such ppl on the road,btohqsg
yeah i do that... when the person is impatient. i normally would switch to slow lane when i see one coming. but he is coming so near me  i give him a jolt,btohqsg
i cant stand rude and impatient drivers.,btohqsg
they cant even wait for me to switch lane,btohqsg
Ya lol a lot of such road bully 1,btohqsg
give him a jolt when he does that.,btohqsg
Some time I will wait for them about to over take me then I accelerate and take back the lane,btohqsg
you actually dontr have to change gear oil often. changing at 10k is really not necessary. i dont even change my diff oil for 5 years.,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a lot we can learn from German drivers on Autobahn. Lane 1 when overtaking and when road clear they go back to Lane 2. Or even if they‚Äôre in Lane 1 and they see a car rapidly coming from behind in their rear view mirror  they just give way coz that guy is clearly going faster because he wants to. No drama  no bruised ego. Nothing to prove. No ‚Äúwah you think your acceleration so good? I can thrash you one if I want to‚Äù  or angry faces or flashing fingers. Just .. road courtesy.,btohqsg
that is what lane 1 is. fast lane for overtaking,btohqsg
