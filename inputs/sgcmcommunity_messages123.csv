Got someone here buy from their supplier OEM brake pads 13.50 for 2,btohqsg
Reminder: Your car engine is the 'heart' of your vehicle. Pls purchase reliable brand/model. A faulty (cheap/fake) can easily cost you a lot more due to repairs of the related combustion chamber. Just saying.,btohqsg
Yes. Brakes chaplang brand ok  just not engine.,btohqsg
Stopping not more important than going ah?,btohqsg
Brakes is also subjected to situation. If brakepads fails and you hit other vehicle  you'll have to fork out the repair bills either way. Worse is if you hit someone and a life is lost...don't need to say further.,btohqsg
The guy said though  his 13.50 pads better than original,btohqsg
Engine only I change oil and filter. Rest no change,btohqsg
With the Internet  there are a lot of website that gives advise on car maintenance and what to look out for. Esp if your vehicle is old or has high mileage.

Ok petrol version what’s the fc…or is it worthwhile getting hybrid?,btohqsg
Only scared the mileage is being tempered as many use for phv,btohqsg
if getting <5 year old car get AD unit with service records,btohqsg
normal workshops also have service record one,btohqsg
if they don't provide immediate red flag,btohqsg
Get hybrid better if your mileage is a lot,btohqsg
Willl she save the long term.,btohqsg
Speaking about Sienta  petrol Vs hybrid what’s the FC difference? Need input from Sienta drivers,btohqsg
I’m talking about the older model (before the 2022 facelifted one),btohqsg
toyota TNGA hybrids have much better FC,btohqsg
for petrol... maybe can get around 15 if you light footed,btohqsg
Sienta super good. I can’t describe the joy I get when I get assigned a sienta on grab.,btohqsg
Step on step off only. So lovely.,btohqsg
Even a F1 driver say their driving lovely,btohqsg
every time i kena CHR i cry,btohqsg
Not sure this is a compliment or sarcastic statement 🤣,btohqsg
the sliding doors open you step on la,btohqsg
I don’t know how to do sarcasm sir,btohqsg
Also the freed battery pack is cheaper to change I heard,btohqsg
In case you're looking at used hybrid ones,btohqsg
But sienta hybrid overall better car,btohqsg
If you buy the regular petrol  you won't get any,btohqsg
They are super practical City cars especially with the parking spaces we have,btohqsg
I have driven sienta hybrid for 1 yearCurrently freed hybrid 1yr plusDon't get hybrid if your daily mileage is less than 150km. Hybrid has more maintenance  you maintain the hybrid battery cooling parts and the normal engine parts.Most used car are mileage tweak  so sent for Pre purchase inspection before buying.Don't worry about sienta pick up  hurricane air filter + tune ECU for pick up.Fuel consumption can tune too.Join the sienta FB group some petrol car are hitting 13-15km/L,btohqsg
i feel freed better in terms of space,btohqsg
13-15km/L for a hybrid is good?,btohqsg

if ur hybrid battery old alr,btohqsg

Have you been keeping busy and well?,btohqsg
https://youtube.com/watch?v=aH5KCJM9LkQ&feature=shares4 bangers can be amazing and legendary too,btohqsg
c43 was always a bad sounding car sir,btohqsg
it was the c63 that sounded good with the usual 4.0 biturbo v8,btohqsg
that's true.  WHO KNEW A DIFFERENT OF 20 WOULD MAKE SUCH A HUGE DIFFERENCE!!,btohqsg
from C63 - C43 = C20!,btohqsg
Didn’t have the privilege for V6 or Inline 6  but their V8 sounded like American muscle,btohqsg
The best sounding Benz 4 banger got to be the 2.3L. Only one in Singapore.,btohqsg

now the used car market also going haywire,btohqsg
You the thai girl is it,btohqsg

Altis good choice. Less problems. Many spare parts. Scrap value very high,btohqsg
scrap value high got what use. the depre also high,btohqsg
Why you look at 1 year left,btohqsg
Of course the depre gonna be high,btohqsg
Many many in market. Very wanted car.,btohqsg
cus i aiming arnd 20k - 30k car,btohqsg
so i dont need take loan,btohqsg
Never ask you to buy also,btohqsg
https://www.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1136957&DL=2984if looking for older one this one not bad,btohqsg
Anything other than stock = sport rim,btohqsg
don't care la that one they anyhow copy paste one,btohqsg
if it is agent unit can go check with TEK on the service history,btohqsg
Buy 1 year coe Altis. Cheap and high resale value,btohqsg
Still can nego price. Can sell $2000+ when scrap,btohqsg
I see how it goes tmr at ws,btohqsg
If major repair needed consign and sell alr,btohqsg
I don’t think u want to pay $54k,btohqsg
Avoid beemer unless you're baller like Imran have 4 cars to take turns sit in workshop,btohqsg
Then buyer ppi and gets revealed,btohqsg
Just replaced water pump also can cel,btohqsg
Just have fun with the car,btohqsg
Fix the car when it breaks down because it fixed you when you broke down,btohqsg
U have obd2 scanner n android phone? I can give u a link to a cracked  powerful app to read errors,btohqsg
No need to come down lor 18 unit 44?,btohqsg
No need to wait until Tmr,btohqsg
U don’t want the app? It can read all errors. Ur workshop don’t have the time to show u all ur errors,btohqsg
Later he say you need go down lor 18 to find him first,btohqsg
Expensive. Y not buy 2008 model only few k.,btohqsg
@HistoryOfManactually what kind of car you looking for,btohqsg
You tell me then I ask around for you,btohqsg
Altis early 2015 Jan or Feb.. preferably also beige interior.. 🙏🙏,btohqsg
Just a normal car lo. I was considering koup and civic. Tmr then say bah,btohqsg
I see what I can find for you if you really want sell,btohqsg
I aiming for those that someone has alr modded,btohqsg
So i dont ownself itchy hand go and mod,btohqsg
thing is for YP cars like bmw the more stock the better,btohqsg
less likely that it has been abused,btohqsg
Why don't want to take loan,btohqsg
When you can take a well structured and lower interest loan,btohqsg
Get something cheaper over the longer duration,btohqsg
And use the saved cash from the one shot purchase into working for you and getting money out to cover your interest,btohqsg
You sure can sell 2000+ meh  cannot renew one ah bro,btohqsg
Better buy stock and mod yourself sir  especially if looking at cars with performance mods,btohqsg
I personally would rather buy a stock car and prioritize vehicle health over pre installed mods,btohqsg
Already renewed 5 year coe. How to renew,btohqsg
And a lot of times pre modded cars on the market tend to be cheaply modded and poorly maintained and sold once the person realizes what they've done and how they can't afford to keep it. At least in the price segment you're looking at,btohqsg
Yes that's why I said cannot renew sir,btohqsg
Hence my question  you sure scrap can fetch 2k to a scrapyard?,btohqsg
Even some exec conti sedans cannot fetch 2-4k with good condition at times because scrapyard and exporter want to make their margins too,btohqsg
Last I heard is $2200 to export coe Altis,btohqsg
Sir u mean coe conti? Very Low demand overseas. They very prefer reliable cars since they are very old.,btohqsg
Parf is given back by Govt sir. U mean body value?,btohqsg
Coe conti body value very Low sir,btohqsg
Example is 2008 c180 or e200 body value lower than 2008 Altis,btohqsg
2008 c180 was 1800. E200 was 1500. Altis 2200.,btohqsg
You find modded car means the previous owner likely also whack until shiok. Faster clean up and clear errror codes to sell. You will likely be buying a lot of internal mechanical wear and tear. No value one these kind of cars. Whatever you do  price of mods = 0. Never pay for seller mods.,btohqsg
Bmw primes you when things could start to go wrong. On an old car what does one expect? There is no mechanical magic one. Other option is just have a car with few sensors then wait until things catastrophically break in the middle of a drive then call tow truck.,btohqsg
Or go for a mechanically simpler car like Altis or Cerato. Different market segment and considerations sir.,btohqsg
Anyone got 2nd tyre lobang? Car left 4months plus :(,btohqsg
Disclaimer: I am not related to them. I just saw their advert and just sharing it. I’m sure there are other tyre shops with offer. Just need to call and check.,btohqsg
Happened this morning after the storm last night,btohqsg
flooding of components due to heavy rains? Or lightning strike 🤔,btohqsg
What tool can open above rusted screws?,btohqsg
Either that or the fuse blew,btohqsg
it always fries electricals especially when driving through heavy rain and torrential water gushes into the engine bay,btohqsg
water and electricals are not best friends,btohqsg
Abs n eps flashing. Share same component. Slippery road. Use obd2 read error,btohqsg
Not very worried about water entering the bay since drive height is pretty good and the bay is very dry when I popped the hood this morning,btohqsg
oh yeah... that only low cars,btohqsg
Ran a full diagnostic twice. Caught nth. Maybe because old car,btohqsg
Use free cracked bimmerlink to check,btohqsg
I used this and car scanner pro. Both detected nth,btohqsg
My j200 some electrical probs. Stationary the headlights will flicker in drive mode. Electrical load will drop to 11.5v.Put to neutral its ok.  Changed new alternator and new batt liao 3 to 5 mths ago.,btohqsg
It’s a fun car no doubt. But whatever is happening tho. 🤦🏻,btohqsg
Our rush high. Wonder how the water get in.,btohqsg
I haven’t had flickering or drop in power.It’s just that it decided to Christmas lights me this morning,btohqsg
Mine has audio sys. Led lights all round. And pke alarm sys.,btohqsg
Nope. Previous owner had done grounding and other sound system mods but he removed all except for the grounding relay,btohqsg
Grounding relay is 👌🏻 prevents surges.But I woke up to my car with my headlights on after the storm last night and it wouldn’t start since the battery was drained,btohqsg
Headlight on then will be batt low.,btohqsg
I had a jumper kit which started the car and my battery charges just fine,btohqsg
But u left with these crismas lights,btohqsg
My only suspicion left would be relay or fuse issue,btohqsg
Thanks to the storm last night,btohqsg
Cos my engine bay was dry as hay,btohqsg
If me i try bring to friend WS that wont 🔪🔪🔪u too big. Ask for helpctoctroubleshoot,btohqsg
Now my headlights wouldn’t switch off and the Xmas dashboard. Had to disconnect my battery so I can drive to the shop later,btohqsg
Usually during every major service or every 3rd consecutive service need to clean,btohqsg
Don't know if your workshop did it,btohqsg
the workshop that i did walnut blasting with didnt.,btohqsg
Can take pic show if it is choked?,btohqsg
i tmr then send car go workshop,btohqsg
Scarli not choked. He smoke u,btohqsg
You've changed at least 3 workshops since you've joined this chat,btohqsg
Change so many times how to maintain continuity,btohqsg
Or if you do go to different workshops for different things,btohqsg
Need to know everything about the car to decide yourself what to do and what not,btohqsg
Servicing is 1 workshop. Walnut blasting is another workshop HAHAHA,btohqsg
My 3rd one the one that did my xhp flash tune,btohqsg
Nah i let someone else do. My car grp recommended him and i got a good price,btohqsg
So why did your servicing workshop not look into it?,btohqsg
Says a lot about the workshop,btohqsg
Oh i didnt bring it to them cus they didnt touch my car last,btohqsg
The 2nd ws i brought it to to find coolant leak also cudnt find,btohqsg
Why didn't they clean it out preemptively,btohqsg
Since it's a regular thing to be done,btohqsg
Becus they dont really specialise in diesel engines. 😂😂,btohqsg
The one that did my wb is also another one,btohqsg
Might be a good time to introspect,btohqsg
Your pattern need to drive Toyota,btohqsg
bro its hard to get a workshop that really does diesel engines,btohqsg
Compared to the cost of repair,btohqsg
long term gain. counted O.C liao,btohqsg
Just need to look brother  if not diesel specialist at least bmw specialist,btohqsg
i just said i doing repaior,btohqsg
^ literally my first statement is replace lo,btohqsg
Yes but it also comes with,btohqsg
But is it really bmw bringing more worries,btohqsg
to some extent yes. my friends,btohqsg
bmw is literally dead in the workshop for 2 months despite an engine overhaul.,btohqsg
his series engine is known for reliability issues,btohqsg
Some good content about engine oil and vehicles at this account!,btohqsg
I'm starting to see a pattern here,btohqsg
Does your friend's car go to the same shop as yours?,btohqsg
/ishe the one who recommended you the various shops you've been to?,btohqsg
My ws guy also told me the same.,btohqsg
Ws can only change stage one time. But if u got the free app  u can change to any stages u want n do more customisation anytime anywhere n it’s free,btohqsg
Mine got 3 extra flashes so thats why I okay,btohqsg
There are too many settings u can play with if u got the free app.,btohqsg
There are many in car groups recommending workshops and shops because of their vested interests in them,btohqsg
🤩🤩🤩🤩 WAAAH KORKOR SET AS DRAG RACE MODE,btohqsg
This guy is starting to sound too much like Pete,btohqsg
Plus this my 3rd workshop is a bmw specialist. So Im testing him out. First time was water pump  2nd time is my current EGR.,btohqsg
"Or ""friend-friend  go only."" Later realize that the shop knows balls",btohqsg
No lah this 3rd ws quite reliable,btohqsg
Sounds like your 3rd one is definitely better than the other two,btohqsg
It was recommended from another grp,btohqsg
At least they can find the issues,btohqsg
I guess cus he did 59 cars from my cargrp alr,btohqsg
Number of cars from group less important,btohqsg
How well they do it more important,btohqsg
Number of repeat customers for same issue is quite low,btohqsg
I fear not the man who has practiced 10 000 kicks once  but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10 000 times.,btohqsg
How accurate their diagnosis is and how good they are with recommendations,btohqsg
And how well they do preventive maintenance,btohqsg
Which a lot of shops aren't good at,btohqsg
Cus one time go i cant really tell u,btohqsg
Let them fix my current problem then I can say for sure,btohqsg
I still prefer my first ws cus their labour not so exp and they dun carrot so much,btohqsg
They don't carrot or they don't fix anything?,btohqsg
Take out egr valve n put in new 1 take 1 day?,btohqsg
Yeap. I think they shud be done within half a day,btohqsg
They dw overcommit bah.. prev they told me my car can come out in 1 day,btohqsg
Most workshops let the car sit there before and after,btohqsg
Why don't you do it for him,btohqsg
Sir he can only scan with his obd2 only,btohqsg
Maybe his obd2 can help change also,btohqsg
i believe in giving workshop time,btohqsg
bro they got so many other cars to do,btohqsg
so if they do ur car other ppl car how,btohqsg
its usually they do ur car,btohqsg
I mean oil change only like 30mins if DIY but workshop do like an hour or so,btohqsg
factor in time to jack up ur car  time to move other ppl car to move ur car eg so on and so forth,btohqsg
Usually need to wait for car to cool down also,btohqsg
As in no need up hoist,btohqsg
Oh man. C&C half day hahaha,btohqsg
Especially if there are cars on the hoists doing some big jobs  oil change won't need to,btohqsg
AD workshops usually take 1 day la,btohqsg
They will do the whole shebang like checks and wash,btohqsg
And they service a lot of cars,btohqsg
@arnavgulianithis my first workshop. its always full,btohqsg
my 3rd workshop only do 3 - 4 cars a day,btohqsg
so i guess quality care is better @ the third workshop,btohqsg
That’s why one does routine maintenance,btohqsg
And it’s important to know your own ride well. Otherwise on road get smoked. At workshop at get smoked.,btohqsg
No matter how well or how much you trust your ws  one should know what you own too. Nothing beats doing your own homework.,btohqsg
Later stress need smoke (not good),btohqsg
If stress I just go eat nice Nasi Padang at a good fren stall,btohqsg
I remember its a doode w a civic,btohqsg
And a c63 for grocery shopping,btohqsg
No they say U take ur c63 for grocery,btohqsg
And a black tinted palisade for gangstering people,btohqsg
I heard he was on the National youth team last time,btohqsg
Yes cause c63 he chill only,btohqsg
Civic just paint different colour change plate and sell,btohqsg
He change car colour every quarter. Faster than I change underwear 🩲,btohqsg

Can tp charge me with not wearing seatbelt although I switch off engine?,btohqsg
According to ur theory  one can never remove seat belt since the car is always on the roads?,btohqsg
What is the reason for doing so?,btohqsg
nope  because when you're parked your blocked in?,btohqsg
and you're not in the natural flow of traffic,btohqsg
There is a possibility a car parked behind or at the side can hit ur car  for instance.,btohqsg
If u stopped at the traffic light when it’s red  remove the seat belt cuz u want to pick up something that dropped on the floor of the passenger seat… that I can understand…But not stop at traffic lights  turned off everything  and remove seat belt,btohqsg
Then like that don’t go out sua,btohqsg
There’s a possibility someone might stab you and die,btohqsg
And did man just compared a parked car and a car on the main road,btohqsg
in that case you should stay at home,btohqsg
Yes it’s still on the road. There is a possibility to get hit. So we must wear seat belts all times even when car parked in cp with engine off? Then how do we get out?,btohqsg
You slowly read again what you said,btohqsg
Accidents can happen in car park too sir,btohqsg
"you want can do ""limpeh go thailand 200 kmh no seatbelt""",btohqsg
Then if you off and remove seatbelt already at traffic light,btohqsg
But at carpark also can get horn,btohqsg
while trying to turn his car on  put in gear and wear seatbelt,btohqsg
You walk also can get horn leh,btohqsg
Sir do you mean carpark don’t need wear seat belt?,btohqsg
Under section peter sub section pete,btohqsg
What I mean is not what you mean  but I know what you mean and what you don't mean. However I shall refrain from being mean and won' try to simplify what you mean because you don't mean well.,btohqsg
He's gonna take a few minutes to process this,btohqsg
Sir if u don’t wear seat belt in ur car in car park  aren’t you in danger like what you described that a car could hit you?,btohqsg
So according to your theory that a car could hit you  a seatbelt should be worn as long as u r on the road  including carpark?,btohqsg
and your license should be taken away if you think it is,btohqsg
Omg this guy is damn stupid,btohqsg
