yea usually those is like adjunct somewhere or both,btohqsg
ok I feel offended u oak fuck,btohqsg
just not be in a camp,btohqsg
Do u stay grad halls or go back home?,btohqsg
At least don't complain when asked to do menial task,btohqsg
"Vj student: ""bro I can ask my maid to do this why must I do this""",btohqsg
doesnâ€™t have to be vj what,btohqsg
Say it's not worth his time,btohqsg
for me i stay home bc i work on theory and my prof doesn't care about me being in office every day. so i just go to campus for meetings,btohqsg
And it's the third vj student,btohqsg
I mean like not only vj ppl act like that,btohqsg
are you j1 j2 or alumni,btohqsg
"""gurl ate and left no crumbs"" type ahh",btohqsg

You do PhD rite? Did u do a MA before or u smart enough to jump to PhD?,btohqsg
Charlotte lee won't be leaving anytime soon I hope,btohqsg
jump straight. not smart or not smart la. it's a lot easier to jump for STEM,btohqsg
Someone in my class flunk his phone to the floor aft losing fun run,btohqsg
I think yijc is the most elite school to exist. focus on yourself and youâ€™ll be fine. if u want to mess around teh options are there for u. if not  youâ€™re in good hands. just get external practice for yourself,btohqsg
Anyways tmr I'm get5ing 3 more vj students,btohqsg
Maybe I'll get to interact wth someone who thinks that doing work is not beneath him,btohqsg
"Just cuz he got ""90 rp""",btohqsg
it's better to go yijc than ri cos yes,btohqsg
Ngl I am jealous usually for CoHASS we have to do a MA or just have a really good topic that matches with an Prof.,btohqsg
if not u can also hear wonderfully crafted speeches from the principal,btohqsg
benefits of yijc:1. de silva2. de silva3. overseas trips4. it's a jc5. p,btohqsg
yea sounds about right. but academia for CoHASS vs CoS/CoE also v different as a whole,btohqsg
no I think 5 will scare people into coming yijc,btohqsg
what did I do to u,btohqsg
leave me alone I did my vectors,btohqsg
To start yall actually have funding lmao,btohqsg
p if one leg of a triangle is 4m and the other leg is 3m  what is the hypothenuse,btohqsg
man i hate vectors so much,btohqsg
3 is available in every jc,btohqsg
vectors is the most insane topic to be on right now for a j1,btohqsg
early do means more time to understand,btohqsg
because i heard ri is also on vectors,btohqsg
I hv given all back to the teacher,btohqsg
Maybe he isn't saying that he's saying his surname... wong,btohqsg
yea they recently revamped the ntu research scholarship and there's now a diff stipend grade for stem vs others ðŸ’€,btohqsg
yea they do vectors around this time,btohqsg
ri is like functions and graphs stuff  equations and inequalities  then vectors alr,btohqsg
we haven't even started on functions dawg,btohqsg
I love AC so much!!! ac boleh,btohqsg
they only have in person stuff for tutorials,btohqsg
Wait do research fellows get paid or isit just an extended PhD.,btohqsg
honestly should just go poly if youâ€™re lectured online LOL,btohqsg
But for research? Gotcha so I am assuming u gotta publish if not u get fired rite?,btohqsg
so in ri they dont even need to go to their lecture halls?,btohqsg
