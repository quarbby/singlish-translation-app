Hi Gurus  Iâ€™ve selected transport as my UOB Ladyâ€™s Category. Will I get my 4mpd if I pump petrol at Shell? I searched up shell on heymax and it didnâ€™t suggest my UOB Ladyâ€™s card. I know petrol is 5541 MCC  but Iâ€™m just wondering if Shell qualifies or would I have to pump petrol at other places. Cause Esso and Caltex suggests UOB Ladyâ€™s card when I search them on heymax.,btohqsg

U get the 3.6 mpd coz shell is uob$ merchant thus no base point,btohqsg

Hi has anyone bought Gold elite secure from Tokio marine? According to the agent  if my policy is 100k  I can get $530 per month till I sold the policy. I can hold this policy as long as I like. The return will depend the market value that I sold. If I die  this policy can past down to my children.,btohqsg
Ask the agent is the $530 per monthguaranteed amounttill end of policy and start from which year u will get it. 1st year or 5th year or 10th year onwards.Is it the longer you get the monthly payout  the less you will get in the future.If the policy holder pass away how much valueof policy will past down to beneficiaries.I check the website  it is single premium (SP) whole lifeinvestment-linked plan.,btohqsg
1. I can get $530 the following Month i buy the policy2. I can get the money every month  till I want to sell the policy. How much I get the return will depend on the price that I sell. If the policy is higher than the purchase value  take the higher rate  if it is lower than it  take the original rate,btohqsg
Sounds a little too good to be true.,btohqsg
Rough check using the total points earned which is shown in the app then divide by the balance shown in app  should be 9.xx  close to 10x points then should be ok. If way less than 9x  then go to details and check.,btohqsg
Assuming you're only doing 100k single premium.1. It's an ILP with dividends. The monthly dividends depends on your policy value. Meaning if the fund value drops  the divendends drop as well.2. Policy value will 100% drop but not 100% increase. Because of fees disinvestment  see below.3. For the first 6 years  1.4% p.a. establishment charge (of your total policy value) will be charged monthly.4. As long policy is in-force  1% p.a. admin charge (of your total policy value) will be charged monthly.5. As there are death benefits (which is weird for a full-investment ILP  like AIA)  different % p.a. protection charge (of your total policy value) will be charged monthly  depending on your gender and age.6. You CANNOT surrender the funds without fees before the first 6 years.Assuming your policy value do not increase  and your agent's info of 6.3% p.a. of dividends  for the first 6 years  your dividends after fees are about $300 per month. Remaining years will be about $400 per month.Standard general views of ILP applies. You can search the chat for the general views of ILPs.,btohqsg
