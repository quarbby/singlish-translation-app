Message from Syfe Trade: Sep 2022Get $70 Cash credits when you sign up for Syfe Tradehttps://www.syfe.comwith my code: HONEYMONEYSeptember is usually a volatile month historically  and this month was no different. US stocks have fallen for three consecutive quarters so far  the first time since the Great Financial Crisis. The S&P 500 ended 9.3% lower  with year to date losses close to 25%. The Dow dropped 8.8% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 10.5%.Are equity markets forward looking?Three consecutive quarters of declines is tough to stomach. Have equity bear markets predicted a recession in the past? According to Bloomberg  markets are not as prescient or forward-looking as one might expect. Looking at 5 recessions in the last 40 years or so:In 2020  the S&P 500 peaked in February  the same month the recession beganIn 2007  the market peaked in October  two months before the recession started in DecemberIn 2001  the recession began in March. But equities had already peaked a year earlier in March of 2000In 1990  the recession began in July  the same month the S&P 500 peakedThe S&P 500 peaked in November of 1980  whereas you had to wait until July of 1981 for the second peak in the economy’s double dip recessionBefore or even after a recession ends  trying to pinpoint when equity markets turn positively is understandably extremely difficult.Markets go up and down  as investors we hope for gains but should be prepared for falls too. History tells us that markets turn positive over the long term and investors who adopt a dollar cost averaging (DCA) strategy do better over the long run. On Syfe Trade  the recurring buy feature enables investors to automatically invest in a particular stock or ETF every week or month  taking timing out of the equation.,btohqsg
