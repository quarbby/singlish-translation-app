Is there any upcoming uob promo? Need to wipe out account first?,btohqsg
Hi shifus I got a 288 cash back appear in my SCB SMART card. Had the card for a few months and used it for a while . Is this cash back a sign up reward ?,btohqsg
Anyone know how to claim the transportation discount/rebate starting from Jan 2025? Seems confusing,btohqsg
If they is any starting in end Jan  they probably will take reference from Dec. it is too late,btohqsg
Should be month of Dec if the promotion happens at end-Dec. Based on similar promotions by UOB. I guess it depends when the promotion starts  it will take reference starting 2 months back,btohqsg
Most likely in Jan  if any. Best time to wipe is on 30 Nov.,btohqsg
Hi  does transaction via NETS using credit card counted towards the minimum spending?,btohqsg
as in not using visa/mastercard/amex etc?,btohqsg
Ya  paying using NETS via pos terminal  some shop doesn't support paywave,btohqsg
Most if not all cards don't as it's paid directly from bank account.,btohqsg
of cos not counted to credit card min spend,btohqsg
"Anyone here use Money Lock for UOB One account? still received the normal interest for $150Khere I read ""Set aMoney Lockamount in your existing UOB accounts to prevent unauthorised withdrawals. Rest assured  your money continues to earn the same interest and/or rewards.""",btohqsg
Just do earmark loh  money lock have to go down branch to unlock sia,btohqsg
"""Simply use the UOB TMRW app or visit any UOB ATM in Singapore to lock any amount  anytime. You can unlock your funds at any UOB ATM in Singapore.""",btohqsg
Earmark u cant touch the money also but u get extra bonus leh,btohqsg

I sold a put option that expired yesterday. It was in the money but there was no assignment. I thought the buyer forget to exercise but received a message 15 mins ago that it was just exercised. I thought this has to be done during trading hours. Anyone had such experience before?,btohqsg
Yes you will still receive the bonus interest,btohqsg
Move somewhere loh and wait for next promo,btohqsg
any idea when is the next promo? so I need to clear to 1K one month earlier,btohqsg
U have to wait for next next quarter liao bah with reference month as mar 25 if there is one.,btohqsg
Lock on UOB TMRW. But it means you need to draw the locked amount physically from ATM as a security measure.Not the same as earmarking  earmarking means you can't touch the money without requesting UOB staff to pull you out of the promo early  their mechanism for earmarking is intended for promo and not security.,btohqsg
I did. I cancelled a citi card in Feb 2023. Applied a new one in Sep 2024  and got my sign up rewards thru moneysmart,btohqsg
Which credit card is the best for value if I want to use it for public transportation?,btohqsg
Do apply cimb credit card can also apply cimb fast saver account at the same application? Or separate application needed?,btohqsg

What difference between dragon pass and priority pass,btohqsg
not much diff IMO....most of the lounges overlap in both programmes,btohqsg
There is one key difference and it only affects you if you visit China. Dragon Pass covers certain rail stations,btohqsg
Dragon pass has 2 or 5 hours per lounge/restaurant restriction depending on the pass issued by which banks.,btohqsg
I heard before  for priority pass can bring guest  but dragon pass cannot bring guest? CMIIW,btohqsg
Nope dragon pass also can bring guest  depend on your card benefit,btohqsg

Why when I buying the SQ tickets I canâ€™t pick â€œ upgrade premium economy to business â€œ option using miles â€¦. Like no have this option leh.. how I know how much miles and can upgrade bo?,btohqsg
hi guys  i think this may be a question that's been answered before but wanted to seek advice from the community.Tax reliefs - should I be looking at voluntary CPF contribution or SRS first?Factors I'm considering:1. withdrawal age2. longer runway for investing due to age3. potential returns from the followingthanks in advance!,btohqsg
Hi  need some advise here. I participated the DBS Altitude FCY spend campaign for 5mpd. Today I check the tracker has clocked $993 out of the spend goal of $1000  but I already back to SG.  Any suggestion how can I clock the remaining $7 FCY in SG to fulfil the spend goal?,btohqsg
The min spend 1k doesnâ€™t have to be all FCY.,btohqsg
For 10k miles is not cheap  even worse after KF costs increase,btohqsg
This really depends on individuals. Like your tax bracket  age  house ownership  intention of staying in Singapore only etc,btohqsg
Not sure if this helps but for some context - 27yo Singaporean  no property but probably looking into one in coming years  tax bracket depends since there's substantial variable income. tax bracket possibly looking at around 100k or moreI've been researching on CPF FRS but don't seem to get the appeal for now  I'm familiar with the SRS scheme but 63 years old to withdraw seems like a long time for me ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Tracker includes local and FX  any MCC as long not excluded in T&C  eg. insurance.,btohqsg
Noob SRS invester here - should I invest via DBS or SYFE? How does linking my SRS to syfe even work? Given the super long term commitment I'm not comfortable with parking my money into syfe for so many years but their investment options seem more lucrative,btohqsg
