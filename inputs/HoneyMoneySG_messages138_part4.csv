Really depending on your expense pattern. Maybe share where your money goes?,btohqsg
Just called UOB also  for SIA direct book at their website  for Scoot and Krisshop  got special portal website to book with.,btohqsg
yuu card 18%/10mpdfor giant or cold storage,btohqsg
Hmm mine is not under this 2 sadly,btohqsg
If hit 600 dollars already. Additional spending won‚Äôt earn any yuu points right?,btohqsg
Yes. $600 is minimum and maximum spendEdited for clarity: for bonus Yuu points. The base Yuu points will still be earned. Base Yuu points = 0.5% + 4.5% cash back,btohqsg
Citi reward cards paired with shopback  does it also work to get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Any 3 months fix deposit bank?,btohqsg
Anyone have a better recommendation of 4mpd min like crmc + amaze?Im tired of citi. Last month got fraudulent charge and change card. Not even 1 month  happens again. Last straw already. I wanna move on from citi,btohqsg
ohh i found one citi smrt seems ok  5% cashback..anyone using it so far?,btohqsg
No. CRMC and amaze is the best option. Other alternatives like UOB  DBS are have been nerfed. Now all it takes is Citibank to nerf this and we have no more on this 4pmd plus lower conversion fees and almost cover all our spending patterns. Hope that day never come,btohqsg
Ya. I reluctant to move but this is getting out of hand. My 5th crmc for the span of 3 years,btohqsg
Perhaps something to do with your phone?,btohqsg
Lock your card when not in use. Next  set alert notification to zero. In this way  any fraudulent transaction above zero  you will be notified.,btohqsg
Alerts are one thing but this wont prevent it from happening. How i wise all transaction will need to use the app verify before it proceed,btohqsg
Hi  I want to buy vouchers from Great Rewards to use at Seletar Mall to pay for my kids lessons  so far my research only shows that I can buy through their app and can‚Äôt find them in wogi or Heymax. Anyone knows what miles card I should use or website to buy these voucher from  thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Thank you  so none of the 4 miles card credit will work?,btohqsg
Maybe can try dbs wwmc or citi reward since in app consider online. Mcc wise u can try small amt first to check,btohqsg
Hi gurus  if I apply UOB lady card and the supplementary card  must both cards select the same category? Thanks,btohqsg
You cannot select category on supp card lol,btohqsg
Sup card will follow principle card bonus catergory,btohqsg

For the EGA GIRO setup  it is normal for DBS statement to not show the first 3 digits of my HSBC bank acc?I notice my cc statement from dbs is missing the 3 digitsüòÖ,btohqsg
"Hi Mornings all Was thinking of using Citi Rewards Card to clock 10x points for my bulk purchases made online with gain city..This is in their terms and conditions- it didnt say if MCC code 5732 is in or out of the 10x pts eligibility..‚Äú10X Points Eligible Transaction‚Äù refers to""(i) a Qualifying Charge made at any store that sells shoes and bags and clothes as its mainbusiness activity  determined by the following Merchant Category Codes (MCC); orMerchant Category Code (MCC) DescriptionMCC 5311 Department StoresMCC 5611 Men‚Äôs and Boy‚Äôs Clothing and Accessories StoresMCC 5621 Women‚Äôs Ready to Wear StoresMCC 5631 Women‚Äôs Accessory and Specialty StoresMCC 5641 Children‚Äôs and Infant‚Äôs Wear StoresMCC 5651 Family Clothing Stores2MCC 5655 Sports and Riding Apparel StoresMCC 5661 Shoe StoresMCC 5691 Men's and Women's Clothing StoresMCC 5699 Miscellaneous Apparel and Accessory ShopsMCC 5948 Luggage and Leather Goods Stores(ii) a Qualifying Charge made at an online retail merchant  excluding mobile wallet andtravel-related transactions*.

Is there a recommended card for topping up NETS flashpay?,btohqsg
Try again liao. It's wrong already.,btohqsg
Double check if the statement specifically states GIRO deduction.,btohqsg
If not excluded then will be rewarded 10x.,btohqsg
As in there's a para that shows what's eligible for 10x. There's also one para that say not entitled to 10x. Both the MCC code of gain city is not in any of thisüòÖ,btohqsg
based on (ii)  for online spend it is eligible so long mcc not excluded and is not mobile wallet payment (in-app via google/apple pay etc),btohqsg
Bulk purchase? How much? Citi rewards cap is $1k only.,btohqsg
Ah.. I think Abt 8k left. But they say can do multiple payments so I plan to break it down to Every month pay Abit. Not installment plan,btohqsg
hm can like that ah. You get goods first or later?,btohqsg
Later haha cannot get goods if nvr pay full la haha my items only deliver prob March or Apr caus house not ready,btohqsg
oic  how to make multiple payments online though,btohqsg
Mine is also without the first 3 digits. Have been triggered on time for more than a year,btohqsg
They staff will send me the online payment then u just go into the link and pay with your credit cArd. I also first time heard but I checked with few gain city staff they say there's such a thing lol so I took that option,btohqsg
Meaning actually I spend $1000 I'll max out the rewards cap for that 10 000 pts for that month?,btohqsg
It is Statement month. You need to check your statement.,btohqsg
Ok ty I read it under t&c le,btohqsg
Hi experts  can I check which online brokers allow DCA in Hang Seng Index? Interactive Broker don‚Äôt seem to offer.,btohqsg
