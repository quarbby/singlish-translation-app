don't think it will exceed 300,btohqsg
just you touch up paint if you dont want to spend respraying,btohqsg
Modern cars have good rust protection in place so don‚Äôt think it will so quickly bah‚Ä¶ but better to be safe,btohqsg
yep short term no need worry cos i think its galvanised,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also guessing $200-300 max max,btohqsg
At least you will likely not be charged a brand premium which is a good thing,btohqsg
