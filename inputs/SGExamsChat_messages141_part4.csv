I suspect heâ€™s at least a secondary school teacher,btohqsg
i dont think he's an MOE teacher,btohqsg
the way certain answers are given are a bit... unconventional,btohqsg
Either way I think heâ€™s a professional teacher,btohqsg
Can u imagine if the father didnâ€™t try to catch her though,btohqsg
He would feel bad for the rest of his life,btohqsg
U don't need to be with MOE to be a teacher,btohqsg

he's one of the more op ones amongst the full time tutors,btohqsg
