I want to be fair Lah,btohqsg
I know ar.. but I did not know what was your point 😂😂,btohqsg
Ops my sharing that bad ah 😬. Locals complain about the high cost etc etc mah,btohqsg
Locals complain about everything  in our blood de.. too cheap say defective too high say cannot afford... 😂😂,btohqsg
Yes. Looks like we both know locals too well 😂😂😂. Locals hv a choice but they die die must consume the higher price items when there are alternatives. In my younger days to budget we had to buy some cheaper food to balance with a few occasions of “better” food. Nowadays everyone wants to only eat good food bcos of yolo Haiz,btohqsg
And if pay up car after 2-3 years of loan is sibei bo hua.... because of rule 78 😂,btohqsg
I local know local mah 😂,btohqsg
I still sitck to coffeeshop food  only use grabfood once before because cheaper than go there buy 😂😂,btohqsg
Young people worse grew up in so much better living environment that their parents struggle to build up their savings then can consume like that  they take all these for granted n think is a given,btohqsg
Working with younger generation also hard.. did some interviews  almost faint,btohqsg
I do comparison too n not go by brands blindly,btohqsg
Yes me too 😂. Looks like we hv same experience,btohqsg
Want high pay  want wfh  want work life balance but no skillset....not happy just resign  no need find work first de... sibei ho,btohqsg
Exactly. I hv been thinking if we got shutdown by covid longer n not hv foreigners here to say service aircon  do plumbing job etc etc can our locals do these and charge us how much to get these jobs done. I dare not think much 😢,btohqsg
This I benefited from.. because I go youtube learn how to do small things myself 😂.. the young families I know just pay whatever the workers ask lol,btohqsg
I respect you leh 👍 self motivated.,btohqsg
That time WFH  have time mah... but I still prefer work in office.. more efficient,btohqsg
Nice chat with you. Need to sleep now. Goodnight 🙏,btohqsg
Actually im at fault i tell the young YOLO spent more. Cos if they also save. My money become smaller in future,btohqsg
No need stats I know of many rich Chinese arrivals,btohqsg
All buying nice car and property,btohqsg
Wah long time did not hear from you leh brother. You doing fine? 😂,btohqsg

They always wanna invest i say go ahead,btohqsg
Yes hv been following your postings. China domestic still not too ok yet right?,btohqsg
If they success i how to success,btohqsg
If tthey eat restaurant food best,btohqsg
What do you mean by domestic not ok? If you mean XJP then yes it sucks. It's taken a step back thats why many went SG also,btohqsg
Common prosperity is not motivational talk for rich Chinese,btohqsg
If due to fear of common prosperity n what had been happening there I would do the same as them lah,btohqsg
My landlord was asking me how to move money out to SG too,btohqsg
Not all rich are corruption. But there are of course,btohqsg
i4i4i4anyway i talking cock la. Hahaha but u get the point. Been okay la working nowaday n doing daily husling,btohqsg
Exactly. That is why I would do the same too to move my money out,btohqsg
Dig deeper I think sure have some form of grey area type of dealings ba,btohqsg
Singapore only recently raised it's requirements for family office,btohqsg
They talk only la if u say u got someone 60-40 they tell u so exp,btohqsg
Not only china want move out ba... the neighboring country or island also want ba 😂,btohqsg
Probably but Chinese are the majority as it stands,btohqsg
Ya. Locals complain but foreigners appreciate our country.,btohqsg
If he okay wif 60-40 ask r chinese come la,btohqsg
Same la in australia the citizens cannot take it,btohqsg
U go sydney lo its like chinatown,btohqsg
Frankly this is normal human behaviour. When Singaporeans go work overseas we also take their local jobs what n bring our friends too. Happening always,btohqsg
Frankly I think they are everywhere 😂,btohqsg
They do go many places but SG is hot lately,btohqsg
Anyway i tell u he knows how to move just he dowan to pay to move his wealth,btohqsg
