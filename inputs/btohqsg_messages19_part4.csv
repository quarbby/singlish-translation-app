The value of the property in Tengah will be increasing from time to time at least for the next decade or two,btohqsg
Only thing that I feel a bit of waste is the Building Height of the overall Tengah,btohqsg
Yeah  that Tengah Airbase is annoyingly close by,btohqsg
It need to be somewhere... just happened to be Tengah.So take it positive we have free NDP show anytime lol...,btohqsg
Even woodland got sambawang air Base,btohqsg
Oops.... peiseh  today only know so many airbase,btohqsg
Does anybody know if there will be anymore Tengah listings other than the upcoming September one ?,btohqsg
Á•ùÂ§ßÂÆ∂‰∏≠ÁßãËäÇÂø´‰πê and a Good morning.Does anyone know how to check if a bto project is confirmed? Is there a way to do so  or will it be confidentially and only hdb will know? (Referring to the 75% minimum booking quota before bto can proceed with a project)Thanks!,btohqsg
Hahaha... Tengah 1st few batches is only 0.4 mean only 40% application only  the project is still process and those leftover units is going to SBFs and end with OBF.I dun think HDB still practicing the minimum booking quota like the DBSS in the past.,btohqsg

There is no change in the layout of the BTO. In addition  people spend a great deal of money on carpentry work and cannot opt to have their ideal wardrobe built.It is desirable to have a modern and contemporary wardrobe with a timeless design.

So today no new bto launch ?,btohqsg
Nope. No announcement means don't have,btohqsg
No Bro They havent announce yet.,btohqsg
They only mention end Sep/early Oct.,btohqsg
Actually I find it funny. Since Oct and Dec bto launch is so close to each other  why not combine both into 1 session?,btohqsg
Dun think so.... they have strategy to plan for location vs launch batching de,btohqsg
Tengah BTOs along Bukit Batok Road,btohqsg
Does anyone know if I rejected a flat selection chance 2 years ago  will HDB still count this as one rejection and if I rejected again means I will become a second timer? Or is there a time duration to how long that one rejection will remains?,btohqsg
Anyone know when will yishun beacon sfb release?Or is it already release?,btohqsg
errr next sbf is in nov/dec...,btohqsg
Just wait for the SBF launch then can check if it‚Äôs inside.,btohqsg
Yes they do count it as one time,btohqsg
You'll drop to second timer status for one year if you reject again. Do call up HDB to clarify,btohqsg

Write to them via MyFeedback to ask which documents you need to upload,btohqsg
Amazing resource thanks! Anyway I can sort the table?,btohqsg

Any idea  anyone  of btos ever get delivered earlier than promised by hdb?,btohqsg

Regret not taking a resale then üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
I was from HLE generationHad to furnish additional documents back then and was given this URLNot sure if it is still the same now,btohqsg
Yes still same but then they dk what to docs to provide yet,btohqsg
I thought person don't know where to submit  not don't know what to submit...Submission is not through My Flat Dashboard,btohqsg
The sms doesn't state what docs they need to submit as well I think...,btohqsg
There should be a reference somewhereFor mine  i was given a letter that says docs stated on AnnexFollowed the list and furnished those that i didn't submit at first,btohqsg
Anyway  person only mentioned they couldn't find where to submit on the Dashboard page...So sounded like they know what documents to add?But never mind,btohqsg
SBF is the upcoming one in December right? What does OBF stand for? And is there any way to check early so we know what's available?,btohqsg
