I pay a couple insurance bill using axs monthly. Should I use OCBC nxt to hit the monthly $500 spending or use Maybank Visa Platinum to get the $30 cashback.,btohqsg
You can top up grab wallet with PayPal?,btohqsg
does your insurance accept payment using the cards?,btohqsg
Nope. I can only pay using card thru axs,btohqsg

Hi  may i know what's the next best card to use for healthhub? I do not have CRMC and WWMC. Only UOB PPV  VS  Lady  KF  HSBC Rev Visa Infinite & Amex HF.,btohqsg
uob lady which category u chosen?,btohqsg
Oh  my wife have chosen Dining and Family. That's where we can use up the full $3k.  Is there a category for lady card which cover healthhub/hospital bill?,btohqsg
If u have reached BHS  whatever surplus MC to MA will flow to SA. Since ur SA hit FRS  the funds will flow to OA.MC to SA  will still remain under SA,btohqsg
Have a question. I am going to apply maybank visa platinum to pay for all my insurance. The requirement for this card is to spend minimum 300$ monthly. Does insurance payment of 1500$ count towards the 300$ spend ?,btohqsg
Co-brand cards. Thereâ€™s uob krisflyer also,btohqsg
$300 spend each month for all 3 months of the calendar quarter to get $30 quarterly rebate.$1000 spend each month for all 3 months of the calendar quarter to get $100 quarterly rebate.Insurance mcc not excluded. Does ur insurance company allow direct payment using VISA card?,btohqsg
just checked none of the categories covers mcc 8099.dun think healthhub accepts Amex. Think at most get 1x point on your visa/master. Apply new cards?,btohqsg
Yeah I tried searching and seems PPV also can't get 4mpd. Only option is probably Amex HF->GPMC for 1.8mpd. I will apply for CRMC / WWMC for future transaction. Thanks for response.,btohqsg

Can I check  normally does travel insurance cover cancellation of flight by the airline? Because I bought air ticket from Zip Air for 2nd April  I worried the flight got cancelled and I need to purchase a more expensive air ticket. Currently I haven't buy travel insurance yet  planning to purchase one just in case. Thank you for helping.,btohqsg
You need to get the travel insurance if I am not wrong within 7 days of ticket purchases for that to be covered. Better check the insurance policy. So usually I will buy the travel insurance immediately after purchasing the tickets,btohqsg
Mostly does cover but best check t&c before signup . A good practice is to buy travel insurance after you pay for your ticket,btohqsg
My partner's HSBC revolution card took a while to approve and mail to the house due to a surge in applications during that period  about 1.5 months,btohqsg
I thought it covers as long as the insurance is paid before the cancellation is known ?,btohqsg
I had called before. Need to be purchased within 7 days upon ticket confirmation. But I had checked this with Chubb the other time. Others might be diff,btohqsg
I see thanks for the info !,btohqsg
If not  that clause of ticket change of date or cancellation is auto excluded,btohqsg
Ok I will try to call and check  nowadays travel insurance is bought online  to have a better check  will u all call and ask the insurance company first?,btohqsg
Any recommend travel insurance company to buy from? Thank you.,btohqsg
This coverage is effective only:(a) if this Policy is purchased before the Insured Person becomes aware of any circumstances which could lead to the disruption of a planned Trip;,btohqsg
This is from my t&c from Etiqa travel insurance. So do check with the customer service officer or read the t&c carefully before purchase,btohqsg
Just avoid Starr Insurance. Had bought because they had some promo. But super bad exp during claims. Hotline no one picks up. Claim too almost 8 months to claim with no updates. Need to chase almost every other week.,btohqsg
Haha yes I did some research although very cheap but avoid at all cost . And some company underwriting that is from starr insurance too,btohqsg
hello  if asia country can consider MSIG or Eqita,btohqsg
