Ya cannot. But apart from that more or less can use for most of the payments,btohqsg
Sorry I wasn‚Äôt explicit in that sense,btohqsg
Basically if HDB says something that needs to be paid in cash  it must be cash  not your cpf or grants,btohqsg
So early sia‚Ä¶ 2 quarters before key collection then survey ba.,btohqsg
hi does anyone know what is the website to see the application rate? and are we able to see the application rate for the individual projects under SBF or only by area?,btohqsg
Are we able to get grants for non first timer? As we are not able to get grants the first time,btohqsg
Haha ya a bit early. But what you can do now is gather design ideas into a mood board,btohqsg
Should only be by area as individual projects are only selected when u get queue number.Anyway  here you go for BTOhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_BTO?strSystem=BTOFor SBF;https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_SBF?strSystem=SBF,btohqsg
And yes  application rates only reflect the estate  not individual projects,btohqsg
Ya la i surverying ID only put in my list,btohqsg
Haha tbh I‚Äôm also looking at which ones will do 2r. Hear people saying not all IDs will take up 2r projects since they earn very little,btohqsg
Sorry can I see where to see this?,btohqsg
Can look for me if you doing 2 room or any house size. We do design consultancy as well‚ò∫Ô∏è10studiosg.comhttps://www.tiktok.com/@10studiosg?_t=ZS-8tn3K3yXSFT&_r=1^our portfolio,btohqsg
My bto still long  will see if I remember in two years. Haha,btohqsg
Check if you are eligible based on the criteria,btohqsg
for SBF  if we apply for an area  will we get to choose the specific project we want? or does it depend on queue number?,btohqsg
So let's say pasir ris SBF have 2 4-room 9 5-room left.If I try SBF pasir ris estate  I'll bid based on the estate right? I cannot choose the particular flat I want correct?If I get a Q no  and the 5-room flat i want don't have already. I won't be penalties right? Cause less than 10 flat supplies?,btohqsg
Sorry first time trying SBF  trying to understand üôè,btohqsg
Hi Jeff  the link for SBF is not correct,btohqsg
Guys just a question‚Ä¶ if I want to rent out another property for say 3 years so my kid can attend a pri school of my choice  is it possible to pause the MOP period by that amount of time?,btohqsg
So my kid is in preschool now  I‚Äôll prob get my BTO for 1-1.5 years before I have to consider Pri School applications.,btohqsg
Sbf should be what Yu Jia shared I thinkhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_SBF?strSystem=SBF,btohqsg
But if I can‚Äôt pause or have to restart MOP  my wife may consider giving up the BTO,btohqsg
what do you mean by pause the MOP?MOP usually starts from the day you collect your key... it's alrd mandated by HDB,btohqsg
Can i check if my husband owns a HDB with his mum but i‚Äôm a first timer  are we still considered a first timer if we select yes?,btohqsg
Yes but u have to reside in your property for 5 years mah. If you rent out and stay at another property in order to get the distance priority for Pri School  you‚Äôll have to reside at the rented property for 30 months if your kid gets in,btohqsg
Meaning you can‚Äôt fulfill the MOP period for that 30 months,btohqsg
Cuz u reside at the rented property that u used to get your kid into the pri school,btohqsg
Oops  the person shared not correct haha I'll delete the post,btohqsg
If i want to reject my current bto n apply for sbf will there be a waiting period or i can apply now,btohqsg
Did you get a queue number within supply for bto?,btohqsg
your current one means got q already?,btohqsg
Only can choose location n flat type if I not wrong . So if want 4 room pasir ris then u choose this option. The available unit is shown when u applied. U can view the map n see whether is high floor west sun n decide to try or not .,btohqsg
https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Feb2025_SBF?strSystem=SBFsorry  I reupdated the post haha my clipboard copied wrong,btohqsg
if your Q number is out of supply  then you can try applying for sbf,btohqsg
The pages all look the same  haha,btohqsg
Hi   sorry guys  I have 1 question   when I will  need to show my cpf statement to the HDB ??,btohqsg
lol then you wanna SBF for what sia,btohqsg
I have selected my flat already  so future do I still need to show my cpf to the HDB ?,btohqsg
Need wait another 3 years so wanted to try the sbf tengah which can collect key alr,btohqsg
Any ways I can see SBF flats brochure?,btohqsg
SBF chance is as good as zero for 2nd timer,btohqsg
BTO with so many unit also cannot get .. SBF only left few unit ‚Ä¶ donate $10 to HDB,btohqsg
Hi .I have 1 questionI already selected my bto flat .So will the HDB still ask again for my cpf to be view ?,btohqsg
Bird in hand is worth two in the bush - you give up your current BTO you'll be considered 2nd timer for a year,btohqsg
Since you already got a unit  just have to wait only  unless you're super desperate. Even then  it's not a guarantee that you'll get a unit  especially as a 2nd timer,btohqsg
does anyone know why are some 5-10 years old  units in sengkang and punggol quite affordable compared to some other resale value of the similar units around the area?,btohqsg
wah. so you rather throw away your confirm flat to try something faster?,btohqsg
if you choose flat already and wanna forgo now. you will incur charges.,btohqsg
and not sure if will affect whether you can even apply as first timer or what,btohqsg
