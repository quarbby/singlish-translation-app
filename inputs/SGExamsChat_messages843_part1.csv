i once mistook the branded audi car logo (FOUR-interlocking rings emblem) for the olympics logo (FIVE-interlocking rings logo)also the same thing with honda & hyundai.. non-card mistakes i have made would be nike & adidas ( like wtf is wrong with me.. ),btohqsg
i have mistaken all these car brand logos one for the other,btohqsg
like my brain processed but doesn't store that information into memory,btohqsg
Nvm. It’s a Volkswagen Golf I believe.,btohqsg

"my father calls me dumb ( or some chinese dialect for idiot ) whenever i tag along while he's working his two deliveryman jobs and encounter some unique license plate number  heavy traffic  vehicle accident and yes  cars that i find unique or cool and ask which car logo does this belong to and he'll give me that look or facial expression on his face which i could define his thoughts as""does ur idiotic self really not know how does a mercedes or toyota look??  like you're sitting on a company toyota lorry""— my dad while he's driving and listening to me yap to myselfmeanwhile also me: i forgot what is this logo.. is this hyundai? hondai? honda?HE WAS SO DONE.",btohqsg
