sometimes I purposely go eat alone sia,btohqsg
That's true when you don't live alone but I do so I'm literally always alone.,btohqsg
Not worth though  I still don't feel full afterwards - for that price  I rather get a full proper meal.,btohqsg
Not enough to contain my desires apparently,btohqsg
I realised that many people have anxiety when eating alone,btohqsg
I kinda don't give a shit,btohqsg
But maybe cuz I used to it,btohqsg

For me when I was like 12 when I started to eat on my own I felt awk,btohqsg

yooo thank you for contributing to SG‚Äôs birth rate HAHAH,btohqsg
Guys is it true  that you can't enter a local uni if you get a F9/E8 for MTL at O levels,btohqsg
ive read the requirements for some uni's all require a D7 or above,btohqsg
so yea you need at least a D7 at o levels for MTL to get in a local uni,btohqsg
if not you have to retake mtl courses,btohqsg
no just asking if its valid information,btohqsg
my bro keeps on insisting you dont even need to pass mtl to get into a local uni,btohqsg
Because he is in express and is gonna drop the whole subject,btohqsg
no like he wants to F9 MTL,btohqsg
"then what does the ""D7"" requirement refer to?",btohqsg
i thought the green requiremnet is for jc,btohqsg
the red requirement is for o levels...so its for ppl who go poly route?,btohqsg
Red requirement is literally for higher MTL,btohqsg
so he is fine being a express student right now and just completely dropping mtl as a subject?,btohqsg
he does not even want clb,btohqsg
and he could still go uni?,btohqsg
You cant drop MT as a subject,btohqsg
No matter how bad you are,btohqsg
His route is after o levels...he gonna go poly,btohqsg
He dont want to pass it and he tells me i can go uni,btohqsg
that is what im trying to correct here,btohqsg
But cant be that bad until clb cannot pass bah...,btohqsg
No like he is the type...ask write compo  will hand in 1 word type,btohqsg
Like i have friends whose chinese is so dogshit but they still can pass clb one,btohqsg
"^he says he can...so i just told him....""Worse come to worse  you gonna retake MTL as a subject after 3 years of basically not learning abt it""",btohqsg
since he alr have his sights set on poly,btohqsg
my bro is literally getting B3's on all the other 4 core subjects,btohqsg
Im not sure about poly to uni need to pass mtl or not but,btohqsg
just chinese right now is E8,btohqsg
Its not hard to pass clb...,btohqsg
yea that is what im trying to tell him,btohqsg
my mother has spent close to 10k on tuition for the last 4 years?,btohqsg
it just pains me to see my mother constantly trying to help/encourage him to at least get a decent pass or even not fail as bad as a E8 or F9,btohqsg
Bruh you need tuition for mother tongue?,btohqsg
(You can talk english in oral & still pass),btohqsg
Im not good at chinese but even a C6 is still wingable,btohqsg
but he also said...he dont want to shit at clb,btohqsg
I got C6‚Äôs in Sec 2 but wasn‚Äôt worth the effort to maintain so I dropped to CLB,btohqsg
Not a single CLB lesson was spent learning chinese,btohqsg
anyways...its his decision  his life...nothing will change his mind...so let him be lorh,btohqsg
I got C6 and my school refused to let me drop,btohqsg
I suck at chi I'm not even chi   never passed all 4 years o level b4,btohqsg
End up o level also c6,btohqsg
chinese is such a nice language though,btohqsg
i doubt he's gonna suffer....its just mtl he does not put in effort whatsoever,btohqsg
everything else he puts in time and effort into,btohqsg
The way it is taught in schools is horrible tho,btohqsg
I learnt more chinese watching cdramas than in class,btohqsg
worse is my parents combined income per month is like 7k,btohqsg
anyway according to NTU i dont think they look at MTL from poly to uni  from a brief 10 seconds search,btohqsg
bruh wow 1.5 months salary just gone like that on MTL tuition,btohqsg
my guy is trying to aim like 11-15 for o levels and decides to choose engineering,btohqsg
can go for nice holiday nearby sia,btohqsg
10k i can start another business,btohqsg
if he has no interest in passing chinese nobody can force that out of him,btohqsg
yes best of luck to him...he's gonna need it,btohqsg
i even told him...i dont have a single F9 in my report card for national exams..idk if that is gonna change anything but hope he realises something.,btohqsg
i dont think he'll be in any immediate trouble if he chooses to fail chinese la but,btohqsg
i dont know about the future,btohqsg
Who gon care about that lmao,btohqsg
the nice thing is i dont think a fail appears on your cert?,btohqsg
i mean in terms of language wise,btohqsg
nobody aint gonna care if he fails MTL,btohqsg
i did tell him...you dont want a F9 in your report card,btohqsg
my bro out here thinking life is so easy...you can just f9 a subject and you will be like a normal student,btohqsg
i dont think a employer would like to see a F9...but idk,btohqsg
i mean an employer wouldnt even be looking at your school report card/ o level results,btohqsg
because a F9 shows your employer two very important characteristic of you as a individual,btohqsg
unless you stop your education there,btohqsg
even if you did they wouldnt even look,btohqsg
Employers see your resume not your school report card,btohqsg
you're thinking a little too far-fetched in this case lol,btohqsg
Report card is only usable in academia ie. university & further studies,btohqsg
It is basically useless in the corporate world because its the bare minimum,btohqsg
i think he's talking about school report cards which it does la,btohqsg
but aint nobody gonna even care about that shit,btohqsg
Can he use pleco/google translate effectively?,btohqsg
but cant actually converse normal chinese,btohqsg
Everytime i need a translation its pleco,btohqsg
i mean dialect you just need to speak,btohqsg
like he can speak/understand teochew...most prob cause of my grand parents,btohqsg
but he is also the type where he thinks he knows everything,btohqsg
can listen to hokkien but cant speak that shit,btohqsg
Chinese enters my ear and gets translated into english in my head,btohqsg
my bro can speak little hokkien/little teochew/some hakka etc,btohqsg
he is the type that can easily strike up conversations with the hdb old folks,btohqsg
but he cant strike up shit with the chinese youths,btohqsg
that is such a wholesome trait,btohqsg
dont those hdb folks usually speak dialect/chinese,btohqsg
just dont know what kind of career he gonna have...,btohqsg
careers dont need to worry one la,btohqsg
someone who can speak dialects but cant understand nor speak common chinese,btohqsg
there'll always be a job somewhere,btohqsg
i mean his dream is to be...if im not wrong some cybersecurity related job,btohqsg
he dont need chinese for that,btohqsg
so mtl wont be a issue i hope...since english is ok for him,btohqsg
later he get some china cilent,btohqsg
btw as we speak..he still have chinese tuition,btohqsg
and he's gonna attend one lesson tmr,btohqsg
honestly if he has no interest,btohqsg
and he doesnt intend to pass,btohqsg
ask your parents to save money,btohqsg
they dont seem to heed that advice at all,btohqsg
tuition only works if the student is interested in the first place,btohqsg
i mean its their money la so they can spend it however they want but,btohqsg
just a piece of goodwill advice lor,btohqsg
yea been telling them..sometimes my bro and parents quarrel over that very reason,btohqsg
"my parents would talk to him that ""you need to actually pay attention when teacher is teaching you etc...""  then he will give like 1000 reasons why i dont need to understand because i dont care abt mtl",btohqsg
he has gotten to the point  he legit cursed at my parents and me when we gave him advice,btohqsg
sometimes i pay attention in my uni lectures but i still catch no balls anyway lol,btohqsg
im just gonna wish him well,btohqsg
ok la we established that he doesnt care about chinese one bit,btohqsg
if he can work his way around life without chinese then good for him,btohqsg
i was sent to imh for anger management b4,btohqsg
so i can see where he is coming from,btohqsg
currently his anger was not as bad as me,btohqsg
He has so far not been physical like i was,btohqsg
I heard rp people got lessons on their open house,btohqsg
To show the attendees how lessons are conducted probably.,btohqsg
most likely because most of the organisers of the openhouse are not y1 students,btohqsg
or those than host them are y2,btohqsg
yea cause y1 ending our yr in feb,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt those quite common for older gen? 2-3 lang + 3 dialects.,btohqsg
what puzzles me is how he can pickup these dialects but cant or wont pickup normal chinese,btohqsg
^yea that is what im thinking,btohqsg
Hi guys anyone have H2 Chem tution to recommend?,btohqsg
^yea sia  i thought it was 9%,btohqsg
but dw  if someone is rich...they wont mind the postage,btohqsg

Like the art teachers were questioning our abilities for teacher day board,btohqsg
Like bro it's the thought that counts,btohqsg
And I'm sec4 and have o levels in 3 weeks  I'm not staying back for this rubbish,btohqsg
My CCA Chers tried to ask for s4s to help after we step down alrd,btohqsg
The day before the open house,btohqsg

not worth it to try explaining to others what they dont understand,btohqsg
we gonna be above japan in 2 years,btohqsg
Some countries in Europe are like 25% or higher,btohqsg
Japanese consumption tax (JCT) is similar to European Value Added Tax in many respects. It applies at 10% on domestic sales of goods and services as well as upon importation into Japan. There is also a reduced 8% applicable to certain food products and beverages. In addition  some transactions such as export transactions are exempt from JCT.https://www.ey.com/en_gl/tax-alerts/japan-s-consumption-tax-reform-will-be-effective-from-1-october-2023-implementation-considerations,btohqsg
That ‚Äòs the only way for them to justify such actions.,btohqsg
But don‚Äôt forget most of the goods we buy here is inclusive of the Euro tax + SG tax.,btohqsg
Cars are also much cheaper in Europe than SG how to compare.,btohqsg
Is it required to tip in a store?,btohqsg
I was thinking tipping only exists in F&B and hospitality based services only.,btohqsg
There ‚Äòs no need to tip for takeout,btohqsg
I mean I tipped in the U.S before,btohqsg
Tip the driver right   u need to tip correct percentage  else the driver will also throw the food on the floor.,btohqsg
Ridiculous  that is so expensive for service.,btohqsg
I was told 20% is for not so good svc.,btohqsg
I never tip for dine in at Food courts.,btohqsg
Tipping culture in U.S should be scrapped.,btohqsg
Since now many of the service staffs feel that they are entitled to the tips.,btohqsg
.... cos cars r made there,btohqsg
