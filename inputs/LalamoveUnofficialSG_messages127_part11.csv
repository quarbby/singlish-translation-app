Because self employed is only entitled to residents who hold valid residency status. They don't have someone to report to daily. Late or no show or whatever also no issue.Work permit holders or foreigners must first pass medical test. Which self employed platform workers don't require. Boss or employer must pay monthly work permit fee or lodging fee for foreigners. Entitled to sick leave and AL. bonuses and 13 month. Must report on stipulated time and days,btohqsg
Foreigners working as deliveryman or delivery rider is perfectly ok. Just not on self employed status,btohqsg
None of us riders or drivers are legally employed by any platform. So we are considered self employed platform workers,btohqsg
The other order last minute ask me to wait for 10-15 minutes while the worker was preparing foods  many people walk in for lunch. I ask the staff how long to wait she said still got 8-10 packages  died liao,btohqsg
bro claim wating time from llm,btohqsg
Hence foreign deliveryman/rider in lalamove/grab/Foodpanda/gogo is not allowed and illegal,btohqsg
Correction:Foreigner are not allowed to work in any work gains be it delivery or anything else on self employed statusForeigner are allowed to work delivery but must be on valid employment status. Not on self employed status.,btohqsg
They can work lalamove. No issue. Write in to lalamove and apply to be an employee driver not partnership contractors,btohqsg
"Which no platform willing to hire because they don't want liabilites eg  COE  new bike  repairs  worker levy fee etc.Once they buy new vehicles and someone resign  the vehicle stays idle until new arrival comes and they don't want this to happen. They prefer partners and contractors who ""bao ka liao"" without a single liability",btohqsg
