p5 capital the players very patient and they happily GTC put sell Q at 34 & 39. When they decide to play  will be a decent run. But until then.,btohqsg
Don't be the last one holding,btohqsg

Sell Q up to 40. Potential target price.,btohqsg

Progen maybe. but if play safe is wait til friday T+4 see whether price can maintain 47 above or not. Unless you are really impatient and want to find something to hoot. Its up to you bro,btohqsg

Sunrise even caught up with jiutian. Jiutian earn so much profit for wud? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
This period  the pennies Market been quite crazy. I guess everyone is on the look out for that next Sunrise / Sinjia .I reckon Progen got chance to join this league as they have similar type characteristics and are generally quite light. But perhaps wait til this Friday T+4 whether they can maintain above 47/48 first or not.But who knows  it might come earlier than expected.  Price looks quite maintained for now.DYODD,btohqsg
Sinjia should have one more round. Kena query. Will pump so they can dump or good news so they will pump .,btohqsg
