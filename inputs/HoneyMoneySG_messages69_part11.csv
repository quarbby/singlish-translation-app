Hi will anyone buy a blue-chip REIT that is overvalued (p/b over 1.1)?,btohqsg
I think this is a very subjective topic given there are many different matrix to consider such as dividend yield etc. P/B may not always be a definite Indicator as some reit are priced at premium as compared to the rest.,btohqsg
First you need to know why are you buying ? For capital appreciation or to collect dividends. Are you gonna be like just buy and collect dividends until cow come home. If yes  I don't think p/b should be a critical factor. Dividends yield and sustainability would be more applicable.,btohqsg
