Don't humble lah Si Yan !,btohqsg
Yea lor so this is what I am doing,btohqsg
So yes a lot of studying of the trends of goods,btohqsg
And how we can best optimize for the results,btohqsg
And how to implement the algorithm,btohqsg
Which is why it is DS + SWE,btohqsg
Data science because you are using data to study the trends and probably classify these goods,btohqsg
Software engineering is because you want to implement such solutions and design a software for it,btohqsg
so u designed the don don donki app,btohqsg
man I will flour dump the shit out of u,btohqsg
so when we shop we get some rank points,btohqsg
No we don't create the don don donki app,btohqsg
hmm i think i should shop more,btohqsg
to get a better uas scoreüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Is the reduce wastage thing why many Japanese supermarkets sell perishables at a discount just before closing,btohqsg
When I did operations mine was literally excel sheets,btohqsg
Also what prefecture are you working in,btohqsg
oh no wonder dddk sell 20% off after 8pm and 40% off after 10pm,btohqsg
I still miss the ‚Äú50% off stickers‚Äù when shopping for snacks at night,btohqsg
Not as much as some goods/supermarkets in Japan,btohqsg
Time to visit them at night,btohqsg
Like I still recall in Japan  half in kanji is the same as the Chinese characters,btohqsg
So I can see the ‚Äú‰∏ÄÂçä‚Äù,btohqsg
Then I immediately know is half off,btohqsg
I cant read kanji but i can read hiragana,btohqsg
Oh I am actually working in Tokyo,btohqsg
I wish I could visit Tokyo during my dec 2023 trip but parents don‚Äôt want,btohqsg
But shag the dddk is like in orchard,btohqsg
Last time I always go to Cold Storage and buy those roasted chicken,btohqsg
bro i notice sgreans always eat dinner at 9+,btohqsg
Also idk why ddk is not called don quijote in Singapore,btohqsg
If they don't sell it  they have to throw it away (which is a 100% loss for them),btohqsg
So this is why they put a discount on it,btohqsg
It is called don don donki what,btohqsg
At one ddk there was a claw machine with mine donki penguins,btohqsg
It‚Äôs called don Quijote in Japan,btohqsg
Oh i tot u mean sg,btohqsg

Don Quijote Co.  Ltd.Its overseas locations are branded as Don Don Donki. Don Quijote Co.  Ltd. It provides a wide range of products  from basic groceries to electronics and clothing. The store is well known in Japan and is often referred to by its shortened name Donki („Éâ„É≥„Ç≠).,btohqsg
But the song still play don don donki  which makes it weird,btohqsg
I thought can only do morning till 5pm,btohqsg
The rules only applies to companies i think,btohqsg
I thot all renovations in residential estate can‚Äôt do after a certain time,btohqsg
I think only applies to renovation works by company‚Ä¶ppl can drill themselves,btohqsg
I dun think there are any restrictions,btohqsg
Ya I see it once in a while but I feel that this practice is more common in Japan,btohqsg
I came to some bakery in a supermarket right before it closed and got all these,btohqsg
Like the staff will just slap on new discount stickers close to closing time  and usually will apply greater discounts for items that have more excess stock,btohqsg
