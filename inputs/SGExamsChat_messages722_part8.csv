There is uni principal? Not that i know of,btohqsg
Wth help!! Parents not letting u join cca is mentally exhausting? Then how did i survive jc,btohqsg
A smart idea is to get hold of a set of house keys,btohqsg
Not every major has got a very accessible head lolâ€¦but the uni itself has a head but i dun think they will even entertain parents,btohqsg
i mean the point is that at uni level theyâ€™re adults so parents quite literally have no jurisdiction anymore in deciding what they do (on and off campus),btohqsg

What is CSC? Double math is FM right,btohqsg
Yea it is like a pretty similar situation,btohqsg
Except that JC has principals and they probably will step in if parents are big balls enough,btohqsg
Correct! But they disappear after going PCC!,btohqsg
double math is prob fm special assessments cause for fm class their h2 math pacing is totally different from the rest of the h2 math batchso they have to learn the h2 math contents first before doing fmath  afaik the teacher there goes at a very diff (and fast) pace,btohqsg
