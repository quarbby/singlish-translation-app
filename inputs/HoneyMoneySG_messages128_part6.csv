XNAP is now folded into the Liquid Pay product. Based on what I know  the use case for us in Singapore is to scan the SGQR code to pay (same QR code that supports Amex Pay but LiquidPay does not give u Krisflyer miles üòÇ) . For overseas especially China  Liquid Pay is used as the e-wallet for ChangiPay to pay at merchants which suppprts Alipay+,btohqsg
Yes  alive but in a different way.Ignore the green lines. Due to security  I have to use another phone to take photo and show u,btohqsg
Wait xnap still can use for hawker payments ?,btohqsg
Cannot! U can use the LiquidPay app and scan QR code. But the Amex Pay way much much better because can earn rewards points or Krisflyer miles or cashback,btohqsg

There is currently promotion for free top and coinback (0.5%  up to 100 coins) for shopeepay. That is essentially 2.2% cashback with UOB absolute for up to $200 topup,btohqsg
Anybody signed up for UOB privimiles promotion? Will they send any sms to indicate that you have registered?,btohqsg

this one unlikely to clamp down because the Disadvantages are also quite significant and not many would be able to make use of Owner/Occupier structure unless you are quite advanced in your Life/Career.,btohqsg
