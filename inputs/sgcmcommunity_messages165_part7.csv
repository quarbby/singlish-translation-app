He rejected. I think he wants to get even with me for offering a few hundreds off his asking price,btohqsg
After he sell the car  he says Iâ€™m low baller,btohqsg
Hate the game not the player,btohqsg
u got the SGCM ad on the car?,btohqsg
Paste here  we can still see the ad even if sold,btohqsg
He said the car body value is 6000,btohqsg
Why u want to buy left 8 months only,btohqsg
I calculated the depre is abt $20+ a day,btohqsg
$18k depre how to be $20,btohqsg
Few hundred won't call you low ball  if you straight away ask him down by 10k+ then they might be upset ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I cut his price by few hundreds then eventually relent n match his asking price. He still say I lowball,btohqsg
I think heâ€™s trying to get back at me for cutting his price,btohqsg
Iâ€™m sure nothing personal lah. Why would he be enemy with his own commission. Times are hard leh,btohqsg
I donâ€™t know. I alr matched his asking price he still donâ€™t want to sell me. I offered to pay deposit immediately b4 his customer view the car but to no avail. Anyway just take note of this precision motorworks,btohqsg
Your maths a bit weak eh I think,btohqsg
The 20 a day math is not mathing,btohqsg
Best case scenario you get 6k also will end up at 30 a day,btohqsg
Sorry my maths fail how to count ah? I see the price is 39 980 for 8 month 19 days left (259 days?)So if we take away the body of 6k still need pay 33 980. Then if divide by 259 is still $131.19 per day?,btohqsg
Or is it I don't understand how it work haha,btohqsg
u did not include parf rebate when scrap,btohqsg
Atheyâ€™re quite the clique  so if you donâ€™t know them  itâ€™s not uncommon to feel that way. Soâ€¦either he sells it to you or not but either way  just move on.You report also nothings going to happen to him,btohqsg
Bro gotta search up calculator when he has a calculator app,btohqsg
He want to show you chim math,btohqsg
I dumb. I just see bank account got money or not ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Sometimes reopen again thinking got money magically go in,btohqsg
ðŸ¥¹ I thought I was alone,btohqsg
Not a great car to drive yourself..,btohqsg
I see the depre less than 10k if nego,btohqsg
what does quite the clique mean?,btohqsg
Great car to be driven in,btohqsg
Eh what you know about lux car,btohqsg
Precision is nicer to you if youâ€™re friends with them..? At least thatâ€™s how I feel lah,btohqsg
I always hear@anwo252talk whenever I take his rickshaw to work,btohqsg
But the road tax  high mileage n maintenance is very worrying,btohqsg
You think you buying A class ah ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Very worth! Free slammed look when the suspension fails (seems to be on its way out already),btohqsg
You're buying an s class? That comes as a part of s class ownership?,btohqsg
Then put AMG badge on sides,btohqsg
I think I will skip. But the depre is too enticing. Sometimes I will think abt it again,btohqsg
Car ownership is not just about depreciation,btohqsg
You must remember you will get barely nothing for this car when you do sell it  too used and not in the best shape for great body value,btohqsg
Add on your insurance and running costs,btohqsg
Not sure if you want to tahan those or not,btohqsg
Better get something that doesn't burden you,btohqsg
Like the heavy body on those bags,btohqsg
Heâ€™s willing to decrease another few k,btohqsg
But I more prone to skip although itâ€™s v cheap,btohqsg
Aiya just buy don't think! You very rich sir,btohqsg
But car in sg very ex. Donâ€™t buy better,btohqsg
Have u seen the ads link?,btohqsg
