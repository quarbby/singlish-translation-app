guys why does my wifi stop working when i use the microwave,btohqsg
and it's been happening for only a few months now,btohqsg
yea like i'll be in my room using my pc  then my mum might microwave something and i have no internet access until she's done,btohqsg
Apparently Microwave ovens use radiation of frequency around 2.3-2.5 GHz,btohqsg
Which I guess is pretty close to a wifi router of 2.4GHz,btohqsg
If you microwave oven is like damage it's possible that the microwave is leaking the microwaves,btohqsg
You could either replace your microwave (not necessary since iirc microwave radiation isn't ionizing radiation) or just get a router which supports 5Ghz,btohqsg
cuz ive been using the same microwave and router for years now,btohqsg
