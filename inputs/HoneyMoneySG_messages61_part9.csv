Yes. On 1 Aug  I Fast out to other bank accounts 5x. Since Fast transactions already satisfied the requirements  GIRO transactions don't really matter.I think it's due to the 5K FAST into EGA account. I forgot to do it on 1 Aug. So I did that from another bank Fast into EGA 3 days ago. Maybe the SMS will be sent soon.Anyway  I'm still covered for August month since it's eligible for 2 months. This time is just to cover September. So can afford to wait.Thanks,btohqsg

hi anyone knows if ...i'm currently gunning for the bonus sign-up miles for UOB PRVI  and i've gotten approval + received this card and now at the start of the 2 month window to hit the 1k/month spending requirement  any issues if i sign up for the uob lady's card now? will it affect the eligibility criteria for the PRVI sign up bonus requiring you to be new to uob credit cards? i suppose shdn't right? since i've applied and gotten approval and got the card + activated the PRVI card before i subsequently applied for another card?,btohqsg
Hi experts  may I know what does it mean by buy hold sell ? if they say $1.40 buy means can buy the shares till $1.40? how about sell and hold?,btohqsg
Buy means buy as their expected price is whatever they are saying. Hold means hold whatever you have. Sell means sell as they are expecting a price drop,btohqsg
In your example  dbs expects price to go to 2.45  so they're asking you to buy at current price. Whereas OCBC thinks it will go down to 2.05  so they're asking you to sell at current price,btohqsg
Take all of these analyst advice with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
I see thanks   trying to understand what do they mean,btohqsg
So those indicators are based on current vs their expected to tell u if u should buy sell or hold right,btohqsg
