If do part time job without cpf  can count?,btohqsg
Monthly pay is fixed even tho part time?,btohqsg
If no CPF contributions then no need to submit CPF transaction history... More info in the link below:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/e-resale/softcopy-income-documents-to-be-uploaded-if-applying-for-cpf-housing-grant,btohqsg
If you have income proof that every month you have salary credited to you then HDB will take the average of the 12 months  but based on my experience  a prudent HDB officer will request for more documents like CPF,btohqsg
Ya I believe so too. If no CPF contributions still good to save a PDF of the page showing no CPF contributions and send to HDB.,btohqsg
Yes haha always be over prepared when it comes to HDB  prepare to wait tooNot entirely their fault too  too many enquiries and/or applications across BTOs and resale flats Lol,btohqsg
Haha I think my gf and I might not have a lot of EHG. Cuz both grad abt same time. So combined income would be high :/,btohqsg
Oh well  just take what u can get  if it‚Äôs resale flat try to get proximity and family grant  if not  BTO prices are always earmarked to be lower than market rate anyway üòÄ,btohqsg
Actl there‚Äôs a lot of debates online. With property prices going up  some ppl say wait for now to let markets cool down  some say BTO will always be cheaper so just apply. Thoughts?,btohqsg
I would say just apply for BTO if you can wait until it is completed. Also not guaranteed to get a queue number. Best case scenario if you get to ballot and choose a decent flat. If not successful try again until you reach a point when you cannot wait anymore.,btohqsg
There are too many ways to answer this question and our biases will interfere with what we think is right/wrongBTOs will always be lower than market pricing because you are trading your time for that benefitIf you take 2012‚Äôs property high as an example  there was a very gradual depreciation so even if (key word: IF) the property market goes downwards from here  you‚Äôre going to need at least 5-10 years to see big price differences and if you then choose to BTO  another 5-7 years before u get ur keys and another 5 years MOP to upgradeMy personal opinion: if you want to BTO  do it early  if not  just go for resale and maximise grants  unless you‚Äôre perfectly comfortable with trading the time in your later years,btohqsg
Hello  I have been rejected for cc application due to bad credit ratings and unable to open a bank account via online. Is it a good idea to open a bank account via the branch and make it a salary crediting account to build ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù with the bank so in future if I were to apply cc again  is there any higher chance of successful application?,btohqsg
Yup also your salary tends to increase over time and this may eventually disqualify you from grants,btohqsg
really solid advice hahah. thank you. So maybe I can give some context.I just graduated in December and will be starting FT job in july w an above average pay. GF is graduating in May 2023 but havent found a job yet.With our combined income  i‚Äôm giving a safe est of 8-9k so almost no EHG grant le. Considering the fact that EHG requires 12 months of income‚Ä¶ I was thinking of working from now till Jun w a lower pay job to lower the avg income. but i kinda have trouble finding job now haha,btohqsg
You might want to refer to the following link to understand what CBS looks at when determining your credit score:https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/credit-score.html,btohqsg
Yup I have looked at my own credit score. I am wondering is there any point for me to open their bank account to build their internal credit score? I believe they not just looking at CBS alone,btohqsg
Congrats! Haha welcome to the working world!As long as you can draw income for 12 months without any breaks in between  the income average can still be considered for EHG,btohqsg
Thank you thank you haha.My thought process is this‚Ä¶Aug22 BTO -> Assess income End22Nov22 BTO -> Assess income Start23So this 2 window will ‚Äúmaximize‚Äù my EHG if i find a part time job from Jan22-Jun22 to avg down my FT pay from Jul22-Dec22.Which is why i‚Äôm kinda restricting myself to the Aug22/Nov22 applications.or am I playing with too many assumptions alrdy? Just apply? haha,btohqsg
Ok I wasn‚Äôt sure if you were planning to BTO or resaleSince you mentioned BTO  you can actually just apply as soon as possible because it‚Äôs not easy to secure a flat of your choice  then do deferred income assessmentread here:https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/booking-of-flat,btohqsg
And yes too many assumptions already I have had too many friends try 4-7 times with unfavourable queue numbers just go for it!!,btohqsg
ah icic‚Ä¶ If i‚Äôm open to resale/SBF  would my strategy change?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if uob cards add to amaze will get rewards???,btohqsg
wondering amex true cashback has signup gift before? i saw all amex cc has a signup gift excluding this oneüòÇ,btohqsg
Need at least 12 months of employment so you‚Äôd have to work first üòÖ,btohqsg
Yes  (good) relationship with bank could help. But if CB score is not ideal  then no matter how good your conduct with the bank is  would not make much of a difference. CB score is critical.,btohqsg
BTO‚Äôs call for first appointment seems to be between 4-7 months depending on queue number,btohqsg
ah‚Ä¶ so either way  very hard to time the income assessment‚Ä¶ i see. Thanks so much bro. You gave me alot of clarity,btohqsg
First home is very exciting üòÅ wish u all the best,btohqsg
This is so useful! For potential home buyers out there! :)),btohqsg
Ok I understood. Hopefully overtime CBS will improve. Thank you.,btohqsg
Any card that gives rewards for toping up bigpay?,btohqsg
hello  im wondering how long it will take for the citi credit card application process.,btohqsg
For card w/o annual fee  is it ok to just leave it there perpetually (aka not using it) after applying?How does it affect one's credit rating?,btohqsg
Ya as far as I know it is ok,btohqsg
Please advise best saving account which provide good interest rate. Wanted to switch my salary account from dbs to something having more benefits üôè,btohqsg
I will have my own HSBC links listed soon,btohqsg

Chris has done several videos  don't be lazy,btohqsg
Yeah! Looking at one.. UOB one is the way to go,btohqsg
Side topic but anybody has any recommendation for temporary storage space for moving house (store furnitures)?,btohqsg
Not lazy.. But community input is required based on their personal experience,btohqsg
Any of them apply for existing HSBC credit card holder?,btohqsg
those are some good signup items tbh,btohqsg
Depends what credit cards you have and what are ur spending habits,btohqsg
Is only HSBC revolution card worth signing ?,btohqsg
If you're a miles guy i suggest to go for it since it covers most everyday spend.. if cashback  see what your spending is like cause most other cards will need a min spend and can give better cashback. (the points for HSBC revo are converted on a 2.5% IIRC),btohqsg
I've applied for HSBC Rev 2 days back and unfortunately the cash back offer was not there.. Wondering how to cancel it now and reapplyMy min CC spend is 1k per month mostly online shopping  contact less paywave and travel transactions,btohqsg
