Hi. I have a bto coming this 3rd quarter and i recently tendered from my workplace to be a SAHM to my newborn. Only plan to work next year when my baby is bigger.Can i know if our grants will be affected? As i do not have 1yr running cpf contribution anymore. What will hdb recalculate on our keys collection day?,btohqsg
You were under Deferred Income Assessment previously?,btohqsg
If last time u get the grant already then won't be affected anymore.,btohqsg
I can't get HLE and for what I know as Singaporean I'm entitled to 2nd time HDB loan.Only take 1st time HDB loan for my current hse,btohqsg
Yes youâ€™re eligible for HDB loan twice. Why you say you are unable to get HLE?,btohqsg
I don't why cos they claim that I doesn't want to take HDB loan during signing of my lease agreement back in Jan 2022 but I've already told them last time HLE can last 6 mths only so everytime need to apply again n again if expire.Last wed 16 Jan during key collection so pissed off with HDB that I paid off everything for my 3 gen hse.,btohqsg
Now CPF OA left with $28 but it's ok later during resale transaction later in Feb they will return back all my CPF plus accrued interest to my OA after cash proceed.So read carefully during lease agreement before signingðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
No. I got the grants already. Im just scared they recalculate and take away the grants on key collection day,btohqsg
They wonâ€™t lol. Once grants are disbursed they go to paying your unit,btohqsg
When will grant get credited? I already 2k to lock my unit. But havent get my grant money yet,btohqsg
So if my loan going to expire and i reapply. The grant value might change?,btohqsg
Donâ€™t need to reapply already after you selected your unit,btohqsg
HDB never ask you to reapply right?,btohqsg
If i want to can i? Coz i have increase in pay. Current loan not enough. But grant is good. If i reapply  my loan amount go up my grant amount will go down?,btohqsg
Please note i havent pay downpayment. On secured unit,btohqsg
Wait until your grant disbursed to you then just before key collection you ask them to reassess,btohqsg
They will disburse it before your second appointment where you need to pay downpayment,btohqsg
Hi. Any groupchat for kim keat ripple?,btohqsg
Don't post unrelated stuffs here thanks,btohqsg
They will probably recalculate the loan amount that you are eligible for based on more recent incomes before key collectionShould be lower with lesser income,btohqsg
Taking up HDB loan is not something that one has to decide at the point of lease signingAs far as i know  HLE letter is needed during application / flat selection and reassessed when nearer key collectionNo need to apply again and again even if the one you had expires while you are waiting for the flat,btohqsg
I am lucky when I apply  haven't start this hfe mine is still hle.,btohqsg
Yes that's correct... cause still early 2022 at that point of time.... that's why told the officer later part in 2023 6 months before key collection will apply again....but don't understand why they say that I've agreed not to take loan during signing lease agreement but I did mentioned I need the HDB loan....misunderstood between both parties during that time causing me cannot get HDB loan instead ask me to take BANK loan.So piss off at that morning during key collection n I  settle all the remaining of 300k++ using CPF...this will cause my accrued interest throughout the coming yearsðŸ˜¡,btohqsg
Yes reassess grant and loan tgt,btohqsg
Hi all. We've applied for this Dec hle & bto based on our income. But wife wants to quit and be stay home mum. We intend to take HDB loan.Should I ask her to work until flat booking so that the loan amount won't be affected? After flat booking she quit won't affect the loan anymore right?,btohqsg
Ur loan amount will be reassessed again at key collection,btohqsg
Just to confirm  you applied HLE or HFE?,btohqsg
This reassessment is based on 12 months of continuous employment / cpf contribution also? Does anyone know?,btohqsg
job market in my sector is very voltile atm. worried about cpf gap,btohqsg
If ur is feb 23 launch like mine. Then is hle. I have an valid hfe but was asked to reapply for an hle during the flat selection day,btohqsg
So if itâ€™s HFE  Grant and loan fixed already. HDB wonâ€™t change it,btohqsg
I'm sorry but is this confirmed? As me and my partner gotten new jobs with a significant difference in salary. We were assuming that there would be a reassessment of income before key collection. So if that's the case  do we have to reapply our HFE to be eligible for an increased loan amount?,btohqsg
If hle expired u cant reapply cos now HFE..have to wait nearing collection key date then they will inform us to reapply the hle. I asked hdb btw & Ive applied hle in 2022.ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
My concern is will the grant amount t change if i have increase in pay? Or just the loan amount will increase but grant amount will neither increase nor decrease,btohqsg
Grant wont change only loan will reassessed,btohqsg
Ok although have increase in pay. Initial grant will remain.,btohqsg
yes cos your grant will come first anyways  can just reassess your loan later closer to key collection,btohqsg
Just want to highlight that i havent get the grant amount yet. I havent make my downpayment yet either,btohqsg
Ahhhhh thank you for the clarification,btohqsg
Based on multiple emails to HDB  this is what they said. You can try emailing HDB to ask as well.,btohqsg
yup! select flat already? hfe validity is 9 months and only important when booking flat + closer to key collection.,btohqsg
Okay will do. I'll let yall know if they say otherwise  thank you!,btohqsg
Thanks. Do keep me updated as well :),btohqsg
Yes . Option fees already paid. Now waiting for downpayment. But understand nw that HFE not needed for downpayment and i can reassess nearing to key collection date,btohqsg
yaaaa then ur grant settle already,btohqsg
Hi all  I got this message but when I follow the instructions to check  there isnâ€™t any update to my application. Anyone knows why?,btohqsg
