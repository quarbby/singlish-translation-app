that's what they say before they call for lockdownI am worried because having a high vax rate alone clearly isn't stopping the virusbut the figures for today haven't been released yet so I better chill out first ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂,btohqsg

Close book can somewhat be enforced if they ask you to on camera,btohqsg
Since they can monitor what you are doing.,btohqsg
I have accepted the fact that the gov can call for lockdown anytime they like and there's nothing I can do about it,btohqsg
Best of all the new Covid cluster is where I am going for my next appointment in 10 days time..,btohqsg
Strike sia and it ‚Äòs very near to where I stay. Like 3-4 stops away.,btohqsg
I see if they can just send meds to my house instead of me going there.,btohqsg
You know what ‚Äòs more ironic.. Got the best acute hospital award.,btohqsg
what does acute even mean in this context,btohqsg
wheb the üò≥üò≥ hospital <90¬∞ ???,btohqsg
Anyways  even though we unanimously agree that CLB is less than desirable (I'm trying to be nice)  what is your favourite song from the project?,btohqsg

Why r thr so many bots,btohqsg
I‚Äôm having some problems choosing whcib school I wanna go now,btohqsg
Depends on what you feel like..,btohqsg
True.. Distance is quite important.. Cuz you can like wake up 30 min before class and still make it in time.,btohqsg
If you choose a very far one.. 2h commute each way.,btohqsg
Hahaha.. Ride the bus or train and let it rock you to sleep.,btohqsg
2h each way ? really ?,btohqsg
About there.. If you factor waiting time..,btohqsg
Should I got for the o level overmugged,btohqsg
bruh mrt via paya lebar & bishan is not faster ? I doubt italso 168 can take from Tampines instead of bedok (EW line to Tampines then bus to woodlands) so that's 2 options ..,btohqsg
Some people just prefer one seat ride..,btohqsg
meanwhile me who changed mrt lines at woodlands  caldecott and buona Vista just to get to schooltoday ü§£ü§£‚ò†‚ò†‚ò†,btohqsg
Of course there is the Bedok > Paya Lebar > Caldecott option,btohqsg
How ‚Äòs the brown line? Is it crowded?,btohqsg
wait till it connects to CBD then it gets crowded,btohqsg
Oh.. Maybe not that useful yet,btohqsg
The station ‚Äòs already completed. Just waiting for testing and opening only.,btohqsg
nice design though  less seats more doors  slightly smaller overall compared to circle line but considering how oversi... i mean futureproofed the woodlands station is  it probably gonna be real crowded once it's fully completed,btohqsg
Is the same train as the green and red lines.,btohqsg
The sound is damn loud no?,btohqsg
They only modified the front nose and maybe the fancier looking display.,btohqsg
according to a quick search on wiki  CT251 only serves TEL,btohqsg
Hai ya who you share earpiece with ?? jk..,btohqsg
Anybody here from NP that took IMP,btohqsg
Is the same supplier. So they offer an updated version of it.,btohqsg
you are right. height width length are the same,btohqsg
higher no. of doors probably made it look smaller lol,btohqsg
But the screen is better since it ‚Äòs from Japan rather than made in house by SMRT.,btohqsg
yeah it definitely looked great  it's one of those things where it works so well I don't notice it,btohqsg
i went for their crash courses before! which subj u planning to sign up for?,btohqsg
But the thing is my English exam is on 27 sept,btohqsg
While the crash course is on 4 oct,btohqsg
ohhh I mean you can still go for it to prepare for next year?,btohqsg
But I have other subjects to prepare for üò≠,btohqsg
I'm sec 4 so most of the crash courses are before my O's,btohqsg
then it's really up to you! if you can manage time well then go for it,btohqsg
Ur prepping for olvls  not just the internal exams,btohqsg
@jacquelyn1234u might want to considering going for the Sept hols zoom session by Overmugged,btohqsg
I meant I wanted the English crash course,btohqsg
Cos I think I quite need it,btohqsg
Yes I‚Äôm going for chem tmr bio and his,btohqsg
They lower the speed along the noisy stretches liao. Now not so loud already,btohqsg
@jacquelyn1234I‚Äôm only going for History + SS,btohqsg
Btw those who are getting ur eae results tmr  all the best :),btohqsg
Why dw go for physics and a math,btohqsg
@jacquelyn1234did u do the specimen paper they gave?,btohqsg
I feel like I'm too down the rabbit hole for them to do much lol,btohqsg
How do y‚Äôall even do preparation for English ?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think can study for language?,btohqsg
Praying can help with ur oral and vocab,btohqsg
the subject matter doesn't really matter as long as the English is good,btohqsg
I feel like now abit too late to start reading haha,btohqsg
At least i‚Äôm able to get a decent A2 or B3,btohqsg
I hope olevel I can get my b3,btohqsg

even if it doesn't help now it'll help in the future,btohqsg
oh just copy from the passage,btohqsg
a lot of the compre answers can be copied,btohqsg
I literally cannot do well for section c,btohqsg
The rest are fine & lc I need to stop sleeping lol,btohqsg
yo not sleeping in lc is an actual challenge,btohqsg
English just pray tbh. Damn unpredictable,btohqsg
I slept for mt and eng,btohqsg
Cause damm tired if lc is after two papers,btohqsg
Exactly  unlike Math or Sciences  English has a whole sea of things that they ask test u on,btohqsg
Oh yea hor   but I really just go with the flow,btohqsg
Wah! I be busy writing till time‚Äôs up coz I can write like damn lot,btohqsg
Oh bruh   the 45 minute are the longest,btohqsg
My prob with English and Chinese paper 1 is that I have no time to check my paper,btohqsg
For Chinese   my olevelI annotate in English haha,btohqsg
Coz I write like alot and alot till no time check,btohqsg
Not a single Chinese word haha,btohqsg
i had to pleco my entire teachers day card,btohqsg
The ‚ÄòXXX‰ºöÊé•‰∏ãÊù•ËØ¥‰ªÄ‰πàÔºü‚Äô the options like quite funny,btohqsg
At least u ddint use google translate :),btohqsg
I am literally the prime example of why kids are losing their mt,btohqsg
i gave up on chinese so i took third lang,btohqsg
yea it kinda throws people off,btohqsg
my indian classmates are a lot better at Chinese than the Chinese are,btohqsg
Lol is what u hear during LC leh bro,btohqsg
If it's not too insensitive why did u decide to take chinese?,btohqsg
haha we had lc for chinese ???,btohqsg
And sometimes Chinese people don‚Äôt know Chinese üòÅüòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
Yea.  Why put yourself in misery because Chinese is misery and pain,btohqsg
My classmate is one..so he‚Äôs forced to take pure sci coz he exempted out of MT,btohqsg
No lah..so long as you have consistent practice can liao,btohqsg
Wo bu zhi dao ( translation   idk),btohqsg
it has no alphabetic system and all the words have to essentially be memorised,btohqsg
Chinese is individual word by word,btohqsg
Haha..I get that question all the time..I‚Äôll dm u about it,btohqsg
Just be glad u dont take traditional chinese,btohqsg
Naturally memorise..no need die die memorise,btohqsg
That's what I did and my vocab is stuck at primary sch level,btohqsg
I wrote that for olevel oops,btohqsg
Pass with myFeng he ri li,btohqsg
I dont even use cheng yu anymore,btohqsg
I still pass alevel chinese compos mind u,btohqsg
Althou the teacher keeps saying my vocab shit,btohqsg
I wish I took the June paper,btohqsg
I HCL so I taking Exp O Level CL w the retake,btohqsg
Oh shit I gotta versus you noooo,btohqsg
I shall bring the bellcurve sown,btohqsg
i think moe published an article explicitly stating so,btohqsg
Theres moderation so it's still somewhat competitve,btohqsg
Ruithe only person u are competiting with is yourself during June,btohqsg
The bell curve is still there no matter what,btohqsg
Choose one with the course structure that's most suitable for you. Different polys might have courses with the same name but vastly different structure.,btohqsg
Paya lebar to bishan is slower,btohqsg
what do you mean by structure,btohqsg
168 is the fastest lifehack from woodlands and from bedok,btohqsg
Core modules taught might be different,btohqsg
Depends on the focus the faculty decided on,btohqsg
Eg  SP Applied Chemistry and NYP Applied Chemistry focus is different,btohqsg
SP version is more pivotable to uni,btohqsg
969 faster ? but it goes via yishun ..,btohqsg
I think they hand more Ls than acceptance,btohqsg
If you can find out if you were rejected from eae portal?,btohqsg
Did you see it? Is either that or acceptance,btohqsg
But waiting time is Hella long,btohqsg
are you talking woodlands to Tampines or what,btohqsg
Unless the driver keep skipping stops,btohqsg
168 skips yishun and sembawang and goes straight to woodlands,btohqsg
But loops at the east so many times,btohqsg
Like doesn't it go Bedok rev-)tamp west,btohqsg
Aso ur friend on insta req me,btohqsg
24 stops from where to where,btohqsg
I just counted the stops HAHA,btohqsg
I take 168 to my student place at befok,btohqsg
why not change to mrt at tampinesunless 168 goes your destination directly idk,btohqsg
If you take from tampines mrt it will only do like half the looping,btohqsg
I take full journey from either end  usually bedok to woodlands is longer  average 1h+ journey,btohqsg
But if very very lucky it can take 50mins tops,btohqsg
its the best song if it was released in donda,btohqsg
It's the best thing Drake dropped this year.,btohqsg
Yeah  he had to release a statement saying that he's actually cool with both Drake and Kanye.,btohqsg
mans just tryna be friends with everyone,btohqsg
He is just a cool guy after all.,btohqsg
It's true though  the fact that it's better than CLB  hahahah,btohqsg
DMAD MPD got in I'm cryong,btohqsg
The competitiveness of the whole thing is really scary omfg,btohqsg
Anyone in RP science courses( life science) ? My cousin looking ppl hahahahahahaha,btohqsg
Enjoy ur new course next yr xd,btohqsg
oh music productioni thought they combined entire DMAD into 1 course,btohqsg
He wanna know if their attachment can choose company or not,btohqsg

Ppl say they are the rejects from JC,btohqsg
Biomedical Science at RPCut off point is 7-12It's the hardest and most competitive science course in RP,btohqsg
I mean  the cutoff seems about the same doesn't it,btohqsg
For biomed SP and most JCs,btohqsg
can't comparepeople can say polytechnic timetable is super slack  also doesn't mean there's 0 homework in polytechnic,btohqsg
Aso one thing I love abt RP,btohqsg
And if I were to go poly I go rp,btohqsg
Other poly be like 2 mods one day,btohqsg
7 to 12 ? ELR2B2?? legit ?,btohqsg
Oh my phone not the only one dying,btohqsg
But RP is farrr.. from East side.,btohqsg
Maybe should have 168e then the journey will be more bearable.,btohqsg
Besides rp y1 start at 9.15-4.30 ( iirc),btohqsg
