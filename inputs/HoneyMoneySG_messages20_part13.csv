Wanna clarify something abt Tbills.Assuming I put in a competitive bid @ 4.2%The official yield came out @ 4%.In this case  I won’t be allotted any amount right?,btohqsg
For advise pls; currently from 2021 till date  ive been using citi cashback and maxed out the cashback everymth sincemy monthly spending is ard $800-$1.5k. Big portion of it comes from spending in malaysia via linked viaAmaze Card.My strategy for 2023 is to maximise the interest in ocbc 360 savings account. So i have to spend min $500 on ocbc 360 cc  apart from salary crediting and increase of $500 monthly average. Since ocbc 365 is visa i cant use my Amaze Card anymore so i thought of using it for Citi Rewards Card  at least i could earn miles while spending after hitting my minimum spending on my ocbc 365 (i usually spend 800-1.2k per mth)For your advise on better strategy pls. Thank you.,btohqsg
whats the best debit card / saving account for a working individual now,btohqsg
If you insist on using a debit card and can spend $500 or more a month  go for UOB One account and debit card. Alternatively if you can't hit min spend  go for SC Jumpstart account and card.,btohqsg
Or if you spend $400+ a month can also consider DBS Multiplier + DBS Visa debit card,btohqsg
Pretty good  more than 50% already above median income ($5020 monthly)! Keep the data going and poll if you haven't,btohqsg
Overall best (for now) UOB Onehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZBot2G97gI,btohqsg
Brought the last T-bill auction at 20k but it shows up as 23k for net settlement amount - anyone knows what happened? Shouldn’t it be the same or lower?,btohqsg
Hi all  registered for a standard chartered smart credit card. Just received email saying it is approved  with physical card sending in 7 days. Wonder can I activate the digital credit card first like Citibank?,btohqsg
Yes u can  that's what i did :),btohqsg
Thanks! But wonder how to sign up? I didn’t receive any user ID/password,btohqsg
Applying ocbc 365 card. Any referrals? Promo?,btohqsg
Oh  i activated my digital card via the standard chartered app! But I have the jumpstart account already  so maybe it was easier for me to activate since I do not have to create a profile haha. Did the email state anything?,btohqsg
I wonder the activation is count from the day u activate the physical card or digital version?,btohqsg
I see  I never signed up for SC account before. So do not have the online account,btohqsg
You may tap on the card readers as part of NETS bah,btohqsg
Simply go only accepted visa Mastercard,btohqsg
Another option if want AmexThen use amex top up grab and use grab it for simply go,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone successfully open RHB high yield saving account ? Are you able to select account type as ‘Single’?,btohqsg
why not uob one account which likely gives better interest than ocbc360?,btohqsg
Tuas Power customers can get free stuff sia,btohqsg
Grabpay cant topup to youtrip and more?,btohqsg
Probably because of ocbc 365 didnt have cashback cap of each categories compared to uob one.,btohqsg
But upon calculation its $241 for ocbc vs $271 for uob per mth. Based on 75k savings.,btohqsg
Just realised my strategy wouldnt earn any cashback since ocbc 365 need a min spend of 800. Uob only 500,btohqsg
Uob is better if u spend Lower to meet the requirements,btohqsg
Wat kind of transactions for uob one card not eligible of the min 500,btohqsg
Yeah. Of the $500 min spending.,btohqsg
refer to the exclusion list in the TnC,btohqsg
good morning to all  assuming i can only make 1 choice.should I:1. Buy in SSB for this month.2. Buy Tbill and competitive bid3. keep the money in OCBC 360,btohqsg
Depends your OCBC 360 hit which tier though,btohqsg
If you are hitting salary + the bonus from 500 saving monthly. That is alr 3.2% which is alr more than ssb first 3 years and close to year 4,btohqsg
For a shorter term perspective (up to year 4 - assuming 360 doesn't revise down)   360 seems to be clear cut winner comparing against SSB Jan issuance.,btohqsg
What about your interest tier . Which category can you hit,btohqsg
Hi everyone  anyone knows whether Youtrip supports Taiwan currency and how long does it take for the card to deliver after applying? Have got a trip lined up there for next monday and would like to give it a try,btohqsg
Not sure about tw but shipment card approx 1 week,btohqsg
actually scb esaver is better. 3.8% for entire amount without needing to do spend  salary etc,btohqsg
hmm  assuming im not going to open another account? which should be my priority?,btohqsg
No more 1.7% Cashback on UOB absolute next year…,btohqsg
Finally it came. Time to cancel the card,btohqsg
so only amex TCB for grab top up ?,btohqsg
From my understanding from the image  do correct me if I am wrong. Is that only grab top up will be 0.3% cashback while the other catergory is still 1.7% cashback.,btohqsg
Going to apply Amex true cashback card Liao,btohqsg
UOB Absolute AMEX will be nerfing Grabpay Wallet Top-ups on 15 Jan 2023.With effect from 15 January 2023  the cashback rate awarded for Grab mobile wallet top-up transactions will be revised to 0.3%.Discuss more on:https://t.me/honeymoneysg,btohqsg
Plus uib amex no anex pay to SGQRc,btohqsg
Bye bye UOB...Hello Amex TCB again,btohqsg
Grab card also can throw away Liao,btohqsg
Is it possible to use True AMEX via AXS to pay the Insurance?,btohqsg
Amex more for niche like pay hospital or insurance,btohqsg
Amex sometimes got good deal from amex app,btohqsg
