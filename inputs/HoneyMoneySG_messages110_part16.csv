Hi just wondering if toys r us MCC fall under the family category for uob ladys solitaire,btohqsg
And transact up to 100k per year,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  can check for DBS live fresh card  understand that the rewards spending is based on calendar month. Just wondering if i spent on 30 May and it’s still pending now  isit consider May or June spending?,btohqsg
June if it’s based on calendar month,btohqsg
Okay  so it will be based on posted date instead of transaction date right?,btohqsg
Last month (May24) was 3.3% (incremental ADB < $500k) / 3.4% (incremental ADB >= $500k). Slight improvement for Jun24 since it's 3.4% single tier.,btohqsg
Guys .. any of you take up uob stash account . They are 5% interest per annum,btohqsg
You are right  i quoted the wrong message. Deleted for misinformation,btohqsg
Huh. Bro. Can advise on this. How you get 3%. Uob put base . 0.05. Bonus 4.95. So total 5%,btohqsg
They go by tier %. Similar to uob one. Only your last 30k get 5%,btohqsg
Literally in the website. Please read before sending,btohqsg
Means I have 30k . I have 5%  ?,btohqsg
UOB Stash and HSBC EGA mechanics discussed herehttps://youtu.be/tjGFz49UhO8,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks bro for sharing. I will see again .. when I got home.,btohqsg
What if I deposit 100k into Maribank? Can the interest be still credited ?,btohqsg
Dbs is based on transaction month not posting month so is may,btohqsg
Again  reminder that if you've registered in May promo  please don't apply for Jun promo. Wait for July promo to be eligibleClause #7For example  if the customer has already registered for the May Everyday Global Account Bonus Interest Promotion then he/she will not be eligible to register for this Promotion.,btohqsg
Dbs is based on transaction date de not posting.,btohqsg
They say spending leh  not rewards,btohqsg
Dbs count reward based on transaction date. Other bank based on posting date. So even if u spend on last day of the month(may) and post in jun it is calculate under may,btohqsg
I heard cash management account also has a bit of risk be careful,btohqsg
Anyone on simba and have switched over to zym?  Though simba is 5G but seems crappy. Hows the experience?,btohqsg
been using zym for awhile. No complains,btohqsg
Like that better go for hsbc EGA.Just to confirm . Hsbc everyday global account need salary crediting ?,btohqsg
this ega always have to gap with another bank account better,btohqsg
Slash have never been a strong interest payer.,btohqsg
May I ask if you guys find it too risky to have so many bank apps and investment apps on your phone? How do u guys protect them? Does it make sense if buy a iPhone just to put banking apps?,btohqsg
Have you read tnc? It is stated GIRO,btohqsg
Because iPhone u can't quite get scripts installed behind the apps but android can,btohqsg
Technically if your phone have been compromised in some means. It’s still possible   just reduce the chances of getting through apps and apks,btohqsg
Of course there is no perfect risk free way that's why asking this questions. I think having multiple financial apps are actually a risk itself,btohqsg
Best is to have good security practices and don’t visit dubious websites or install unofficial apps.,btohqsg
Tbh  if you are getting an iPhone just to do that then no  unless you don’t mind paying just for that sole purpose. All phones have an equal chance of being compromised just android have slightly more attack surface,btohqsg
Having a separate phone make sense. One phone u have banks  finance  singpass.... everything in one... and as u put aside u won't really download funny app on it,btohqsg
If it’s only for banking apps and not installing anything else  you don’t even need specifically an iPhone to do so. Since you won’t be doing anything else other that money related,btohqsg
Yea I can't deny the price tag hesitate as a backup device indeed,btohqsg
Side loading on android is the main concerns of worries for compromising.Which current Apple still don’t allow unless you reside in the EU.Android have been working to prevent malicious actions which recently added check and declaration on if you are using the ability to scanning of entire phone applications.Android 13 and above added malicious checker and verification when installing of applications now.From what I know some Chinese brand turn that feature off.Anyway just keep security update on and avoid  cheap phone due to lack of security updates.I work as a mobile app dev and it have been pain in the ass in recent time when both company policy change so much and so many declarations to do and remove certain permission that they deem bad like tracker or what not   I would say right android have improved a lot for security concern but issues is different brand handle it different comparing to Apple who is the only doing all the control.If you are really afraid then you can use Apple  for your daily. It still offer better security.It much more streamline and offer better security and also more features to help you with it or at least from a developer POV.I use iPhone mainly for all financial stuffs and Android for my games and what not ~,btohqsg
