Mpv for when going out as a family,btohqsg
If me and my wife go out  we come back with car full one ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Like today we planned to go ikea eat meatball only,btohqsg
We lucky we donâ€™t have out own house yet,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£ i think if have  same like you,btohqsg
go out w my mum and sis,btohqsg
Please even without house  she will buy a lot of groceries or things like toys etc,btohqsg
I was thinking of mx-5 for my next car,btohqsg
don't remind me of the time when I only wanted to buy a block of butter  but because i was with some friends ended up buying $60 worth of groceries,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why need a car for date night snd a car for grocery,btohqsg
dont get mazda leh  very uncle. get tucson,btohqsg
If miata is for uncles  i wanna be an uncle,btohqsg
No Tucson is for cool kidz,btohqsg
You know why is uncle car anot  because old already,btohqsg
If you buy MX5 then is not uncle car,btohqsg
the newer one damn cool bro,btohqsg
I personally love older cars anyways,btohqsg
An mx-5 is much lesser of an uncle car,btohqsg
i'm thinking of selling alr kns,btohqsg
Me love any car as long as cool tech is there,btohqsg
I cannot deal with the new tech ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ that time I rented a C180 from getgo,btohqsg
When you bought it you committed to having impracticality for a sexy nice ride,btohqsg
sell first then go test drive ba,btohqsg
It's all about getting used to it,btohqsg
Iâ€™ll stick to just simple things HAHA i am not a technology guy at all,btohqsg
GetGo now a lot of nice ride Sia now you mention,btohqsg
@Chinese_spy_balloonwho the guy that was telling me his golf today ah,btohqsg
i found out Get-Go is owned by the dealer that i bought my car from,btohqsg
the salesman say oh  the boss son started get-go  then now they own LCR,btohqsg
They have A5 and 5 Series  now driving them like not very satki alr,btohqsg
But most of them broken or off the app soon because people don't know how to drive,btohqsg
For this coe  it is cheap lah,btohqsg
U minus the coe  it is cheapâ€¦ compare to when coe was lower,btohqsg
no wonder so c0cky at times,btohqsg
Then you see how they got good control over COE,btohqsg
Just FYI did you notice Motor-East inside the office got LCR counter LOL,btohqsg
They started by taking ssangyongs that were unsold for getgo,btohqsg
Then buy cars they were getting for LCR,btohqsg
Then they pickup from the used car side,btohqsg
I mean if I rent a sports car Iâ€™ll whack one mah,btohqsg
Got one rental coy very yuck one  rent out Porsche but set speed limit,btohqsg
Fair but the entry point on getgo too low,btohqsg
And people don't realize the excess,btohqsg
End of the day they donâ€™t earn from rental etc,btohqsg
last time they offer me 180 leh,btohqsg
I used to know the people who started Shariot  they told me they earn money from people who bang up their car and also those that kena accident,btohqsg
I dun rent cars cus u scratch abit,btohqsg
If u cant afford a car  u cant afford the excess. Honestly,btohqsg
Not true  if GetGo they have the excess waiver so itâ€™s not as badOutside rental also have CDW for long term rental,btohqsg
Just so you know  if you buy CDW renting outside long term  your first waiver is $200 excess  then $500 and so on,btohqsg
