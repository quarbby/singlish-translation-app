You know wat sometime client will cancel on rider when they wan save money if they need a sedan??,btohqsg
This happened to me 2 days back. Not duplicate order but this guy is a joke. I was riding on expressway saw this order n was along the way as I'm heading from toapayoh to town didn't mind to do a quicker order. In the end I communicated with the customer on chat saying I will reach in 15-20mins. When arrived the customer cancelled on me. And I was given $2.50 cancellation fee despite wasting my 20mins to travel down. And today CS contacted me and want me to contact them because I missed their call. So now I contacted helpline for this case and they said this fkn cheapo customer expect n wants a refund. Maybe i shdve jst ignored them,btohqsg
Toapayoh to orchard then back to toapayoh order. Pooling for just $11.50 he should be thankful I reached in 20mins to collect yet this fker cancelled on me and demand CS for cancellation fee back for just $2.50 after wasting my time to arrive at toapayoh for him  waste my time yet he is cheapo until now demands CS for this $2.50 cancellation fee back like WTF. And now CS siding him n agreed to pay him back the cancellation fee say I never call the customer when I was riding how I call. Damn cb,btohqsg
If only I clicked call or saved his number. I will call him back now or go down his location door and confront him this ridiculous cheapo. This is how I know I never ever want to take pooling orders anymore. Pooling order clearly stated pickup before 2hours and I did within 20mins and he cancelled on me instead after I arrived muddafker,btohqsg
Not that I want his filthy $2.50 and him being so cheapo n that CS has to harass me to claim back his 2.50 rly disgust me n waste my time,btohqsg
This kind of people really should deserve a big time whack or scolding,btohqsg
Fk all the pooling orders customer that expect immediate collection n always hurrying us rider. Like this guy  cheapo ask for pooling yet wants immediate pickup and I arrived within 20mins he cancelled on me like wtf,btohqsg
Wasted didn't catch his full address  and HP number if not cfm call or confront him for a big scolding,btohqsg
Was on the way 2 days back,btohqsg
That's why I learnt my lesson never ever take pooling orders anymore,btohqsg
Regardless on the way anot lol because all cheapo customers that set pooling yet demanding fast delivery frkn irritating,btohqsg
Yup2...just dont support cheapo customer. They want cheap  let them send the item themselves.,btohqsg
Yeaa we need to boycott ALL pooling orders honestly fk them,btohqsg
Regardless on the way for us anot,btohqsg
We need all lalamove riders or do Part time or full time to be in this group and know this message lol,btohqsg
Anyway guys.. just try to call customer b4 proceeding to collection point to confirm on the job & item descriptions. No point u text in the app. Atleast if u call u have the call log u will get 50% compensation. I learn my lesson last 2 years ago.. üòÖ they never answer call i wont go.. cause there's alot of scammer... take note so we wont waste our time... üëåüí™,btohqsg
Or can just take those that pay with credit,btohqsg
Truee but just sad I didn't because I was riding and I don't have Bluetooth headset in my helmet call already can't talk while riding,btohqsg
Or possible to just click call then end call? Just for the call log evidence lol,btohqsg
But nowadays lalamove money not a lot not worth doing hahaah and with all these kinda of cheapo customers n pooling order nonsense very annoying thankfully this is just a past time for me since I'm free now,btohqsg
Already done that long time ago... i wont even take cheap prices to be honest. If cheap prices i can get non stop doing grabfood or deliveroo... lalamove is a courier services. So courier services is totally different from food delivery. More better  last 10yrs ago... express delivery must complete in 1hr time  payment is $30-50. Last time cost of living also not bad.. now cost of living so bad... prices getting lower  if there's someone still took it cant blame anyone else cause the person itself is supporting/agreeing to that kind of fees. We need to work wisely. Remember  you are in the road. Risky job  accident may appear anytime. Stay safe.,btohqsg
Last time lalamove courier service can 1hour earn 30-50?!,btohqsg
Yup2... im in delivery line for 21yrs already. Last time earn so much and no one knows too.. never got viral.. nowdays they earn so much  post in socmed all want to do... then prices all getting lower.. might as well dont do... üòÖ,btohqsg
Now bike... bruh.. last time van earn sooo good.. hahha.. now i dk how ppl survive using van or car.... with traffic so bad and parking so troublesome...,btohqsg
Not adding fuel cost is crazyy!,btohqsg
Yes last time llm good money. Especially during covid time. At that period no1 want do cos scared covid. Prices were good. Even 1+ yr after lockdown gone also good,btohqsg
Then after that the prices start to cui. And more pple start to do. Saturated. Orders less drivers more. N llm go adjust the prices with all the shit stuff cos have to lower price to attract customers. N of cos more foreigners start to do.,btohqsg
Ironically price low then more n more pple come doü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Last time 1 job can earn 30+ liao lor,btohqsg
Do a stack also can get 50+,btohqsg
For me I joined just b4 lockdown,btohqsg
Can stack n stack cos no traffic. 1 hr can do 3 4 jobs even if get the right stack,btohqsg
Now so pathetic each order barely 10dollars depends on distance,btohqsg
And now u're still doing with car?,btohqsg
