Hi friends  how do I check my HSBC points that can be converted to miles? I’ve only been using HSBC revolution for 2 weeks. Or can I only see it if I pay for the yearly fee for converting miles,btohqsg
Have you enrolled into the mileage program?,btohqsg
Is it the one where you pay $40+ for unlimited miles conversions for a year?,btohqsg
Nope  so if I don’t enroll I don’t get to see it?,btohqsg
Unless u are just looking to see what are the points u have.You can see it in the hsbc app.Under your CC  you tap on View More,btohqsg
Oh the x9 points will only reflect the month after  I thought the points didn’t tally  but yea thanks for your help kind sir :),btohqsg
Yeah no problem I also got the card abt 1 week back  so I’m also figuring out,btohqsg

I got uob one card on 1 Nov  card approved on 27 Oct. I received the statement at 15 Nov with less than $500 due  meaning I won't hit the minimum.I assumed the statement date would be much later like 27th or 30th but abruptly cut off at 15th before I could spend $500.If I call CS to realign the statement month to calendar month  will it only take effect Dec? Any way to request statement to adjust so to clock $500 for Nov and Dec?,btohqsg
You can try on the UOB website online CS chat. But if you have received the statement already I don’t think you can adjust for Nov. Only December.Highly suggest using the online chat cos if you call in you wait damn long.,btohqsg
u can still clock $500 in the Dec statement to get prorated $16.67 quarterly rebatechange statement date will only take effect in Dec.Can try chat/call UOB to appeal. See if they allow u to make up the spending to get the $16.67 for Nov statement,btohqsg
Guess even getting the prorated $16.67 will require appealing and not guaranteed? Cos based on t&cs need to hit minimum spend for consecutive three months to be eligible for cashback,btohqsg
based on tnc  first quarter can prorate if met spend in last month or last 2 months of quarter,btohqsg
Depends on when u applied card too,btohqsg
Yeah and if the quarterly cashback is applicable to Dec only (16/11-15/12)  I still get bonus cashback for partner merchants right?,btohqsg
Hi can I check for uob evol  if I spend in ntuc and pay using the app linked to Apple Pay isit considered mobile contactless or online?,btohqsg
"Online  must use Mouse Hunter's definition of phone ""kiss"" the contactless terminal then counted mobile contactless",btohqsg

To clarify if same thing I go ntuc buy but I select pay by credit card then pay using mobile then liddat is considered mobile contactless? Jialat last day of the month then I realize,btohqsg
Hi Everyone  I'm withdrawing from Tiger Prime Account to DBS account and it's indicated that it should arrive in 1 working day. Previously with smaller amounts (around 10k mark)  my withdrawal request (iirc) + withdrawal fund remittance notice email from Tiger + fund credited in DBS was completed within the same day. Does anyone know...should I be expecting longer waiting times for larger amounts like 50 60k?,btohqsg
One Krisflyer account to One name. Though you may add redemption nominees if you have excess miles to redeem.But your concern seems to be not enough miles so you're trying to combine them for redemption  which does not work,btohqsg
Ahhh okay okay. Thanks a lot 🥹,btohqsg
Anyone here have using iChange apps? Can check how to transfer to touch and go from the iChange apps wallet balance in ringgit currency,btohqsg
