Hi sorry im new to this  which IBKR is better for me to trade from mobile? And what are the differences? Thank guys!!,btohqsg
Can use crypto dot com card. $5k tier comes with lounge key  unlimited lounge access,btohqsg
Is there any mobile broker that allows us to buy gbtc the usa bitcoin trust fund,btohqsg
Yes all credit cards with 1-6 passes a year pales compared to CDC card lounge pass. Plus u dont have to monitor which card used how many times.,btohqsg
Yes  sign up for Crypto[dot]com Exchange & VISA Card (Free $25 CRO):https://bit.ly/cryptodcCODE: honeymoneyFree lounge passes if you stake $5000 worth of CRO,btohqsg
Never tried buying GBTC on IBKR. But why not just buy BTC on Gemini/FTX. GBTC has management fees,btohqsg
Opening this question to the floor  anyone tried crypto trading bot? Wanted to try Pionex but found out that it‚Äôs not allow in SG.,btohqsg
Because gbtc is at a 20-30% discount at NAV. And this trust has the highest potential to turn into etf.  I m buying btc oncrypto.comand using its card frequently even for online purchases cos i stake and am getting 5% cash back and u can choose to get it in btc  eth or cro,btohqsg

Hi all i have a question  lets say i want to invest into IBKR for at least 10 years with DCA monthly of $100 into EFT.Which S&P index should i use? VOO or VUSD? Taking into account both the dividend withholding tax and expense ratio. Which will turn out generating more dividend or value in the long run? Thank you!!,btohqsg
Time for@boontee86shifu to show his skill,btohqsg
VUSD better  cheaper due to 15% WHT,btohqsg
shifu should have video to explain right?,btohqsg
this is the most commonly asked question on 1m65,btohqsg
Actually for monthly $100 USD is very small amount  either Syfe Select custom CSPX or Syfe Trade VOO.IBKR UK commission $2 + Monthly $2 fx conversion for a $100 DCA is too expensive,btohqsg
yes monthly $100 very small  start with robo also good  most important is to build a habit of consistent saving+investing,btohqsg
Thanks so much for the help! Currently in NS so dont have much to DCA every monthüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Yeah then Syfe is best for you. Get some Sign-up rewards using my code btw@sgpromocode,btohqsg
