So late. Can't wait to see my tutee achievements. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

funny how i asked that at 2am,btohqsg
"I do applaud Ariana Grande for the bold production choices as it shows her versatility but from a cohesive narrative standpoint  ""Thank you  Next"" is much thought out.",btohqsg
Sian. Results day range from 17 - 21. They decide to put it on 17,btohqsg
though i didnt listen to all the songs there,btohqsg
"That was great as well but I much prefer ""Thank you  Next.""",btohqsg
I am still disappointed by the GRAMMYs snubbing The Weeknd.,btohqsg
my favourite from tyn is bloodline,btohqsg
"No  like he did not get nominated for any awards despite ""After Hours"" being one of the best albums for the year and ""Blinding Lights"" being a hit single of the year.",btohqsg
Yeah  I like the song but it feels weird in the context of the album imho.,btohqsg
Anyone waiting for Kid Cudi's Man on The Moon 3?,btohqsg
dont @ me but i feel blinding lights isnt that great,btohqsg
it was nice after that it isnt,btohqsg
I agree with you to an extent as the album did not spawn another hit single besides that song.,btohqsg
It makes much more sense in the context of the album as the song isn't that light hearted if you listen to the song which precedes it in the album.,btohqsg
Overplayed songs tend to get annoying,btohqsg
But no matter how many times blinding lights gets overplayed it's still better than bad guy,btohqsg
I wouldn't directly say that since they are of different genres and a comparison of such magnitude would be unfair.,btohqsg
But no matter how much autotune u have in ur song u still have to sinG,btohqsg
I think Lil Wayne has something to say about that.,btohqsg
"It's unfortunate how that album is only recognised for ""Bad Guy"".",btohqsg
I listen most of her songs from 2015 onwards,btohqsg
But i stopped somewhere in 2019,btohqsg
I think that was the unfortunate moment where her songs went downhill,btohqsg
tbh that whole album isnt my type of thing so i skip it,btohqsg
the press release for Oâ€™s arenâ€™t out yet,btohqsg
tbh its the first song that stood out to me frm the album,btohqsg

Focused too much on my other subjects,btohqsg

I am not very sure abt the syb for combined sci,btohqsg

Imagine what would H3 GP or H3 PW would be like,btohqsg
H3 PW would probably be organising some event for the government or some major corporation,btohqsg
