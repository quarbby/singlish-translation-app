You help ba  my C++ boundary hit,btohqsg
if you're truly using cpp  then use vectors,btohqsg
I noob at C++ but from what I think struct is custom type,btohqsg
I might not have time to learn new shit,btohqsg
Is there a way I can do something similar,btohqsg
your array must be of the same type,btohqsg
you're just limiting yourself trying to do that,btohqsg
Actuslly u can just create a function to convert arrays using hash,btohqsg
Not much of an issue there,btohqsg
But idk how else to be able to add users,btohqsg
Or change data in cells for that matter,btohqsg
and how is she going to get a hash function in?,btohqsg
sigh i'll get some sample code,btohqsg
Let ur desired data set lets say int be represented by a char set,btohqsg
So u write a function that can convert int to char for storage,btohqsg
Idk how limited the scope is for cpp for that,btohqsg
is '5int' a size 5 integer?,btohqsg
Fuckkkk my life I totally don't have time for that but I can't just not do it if not I can't move on to code other shit,btohqsg
Doesnt cpp allow int to be stored as string ? Just convert everything to a string,btohqsg
Wa but IDK how to do this in an 'easy' or 'usable' way in C++,btohqsg
Uhhh how TF does one do that,btohqsg
I can tell you for sure,btohqsg
Thats coz shes limited to cpp,btohqsg
I originally wanted to use fstream but pic18 has no file systems :'),btohqsg
Why not use vectors of arrays of 5 ints,btohqsg
But uhh IDK any easier way,btohqsg
No idea  never learnt about it,btohqsg
Basically they have easier addition of members methods,btohqsg
Array needs to prealloc memory I think  so you can never have easy 'addition' of rows to an array,btohqsg
So if you want to add or remove users or rows on the fly I definitely DON'T recommend array,btohqsg
the eeprom has 256 bytes of usable memory,btohqsg
But I haven't learnt that shit,btohqsg
"#include <string.h>#include <stdio.h>#define MAX_LEN 256struct user_t {char id[MAX_LEN];int first;int second;int third;};int main() {user_t arr[MAX_LEN];// Init first userstrcpy(arr[0].id  ""1234567890"");arr[0].first = 0;arr[0].second = 1;arr[0].third = 2;printf(""User is %s  first int is %d  second int is %d  third int is %d""  arr[0].id  arr[0].first  arr[0].second  arr[0].third);}",btohqsg
Even the 4.0 GPA senior said that it's not easy,btohqsg
Paiseh  not int int int  is pair int int  pair int int  size 5 arr int,btohqsg
W h a t is t h i s,btohqsg
doesn't matter whether you use tuple or pair inside the struct anyway,btohqsg
you're basically making your own at this point,btohqsg
@Alexandra_WildeAnyway you should be able to use his boilerplate to make your own from here?,btohqsg
You need change it such that your 2nd thing 3rd thing and 4th thing are what you need,btohqsg
I don't understand it at all,btohqsg
which part do you not understand?,btohqsg
Do u know basics of classes ?,btohqsg
well... that's as much as I can recommend,btohqsg
Ah oo yeah struct seems like baby oop,btohqsg
Then is it Templates which is custom types?,btohqsg
idk  she says she's using cpp  but everything discussed so far is C,btohqsg
yeah templates allow you to initialise the class with whatever class you want,btohqsg
hey structs can even contain function pointers,btohqsg
so you can have functions inside your struct making it more oop,btohqsg
