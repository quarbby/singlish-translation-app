Today feel like a good day. Let’s keep it that way how about that. We are all here wanting to be objective and wanting to make money. That’s all,btohqsg
Hmm I thought should be based on target price instead of timing,btohqsg
Absolutely no reason to do that.,btohqsg
Let’s say opening at -20%  would you sell at opening or wait?,btohqsg
wait lah...why open -20%? Kan siao,btohqsg
Example: My target price is $1 and opening happen to be at $1  I'd just put on queue to liquidate. Nobody know for certain what will happen after market open and sure enuff there may be opportunity cost.,btohqsg
Chill everyone...money is always sensitive. Especially losing or the potential to lose. Emotions at play. Let's all be more friendly! Happy Monday all. And remember the stock market always surprises. Good result doesn't mean will go up  average result  nobody knows what till happen. Then there are those with bad results/negative equity/kena investigation (e.g kitchen) that can chiong.,btohqsg
Let's see some numbers.Without the govt grant 1.5  the net profit is 3.5mio.EPs 0.0069.65x pe at price 45c.Will investor buy something at 65x?Or rather will u buy 65x pe vicpla or maybe f&n at 12x pe.?,btohqsg
Kitchen kena investigated where got chiong. U refer to wrong kitchen izzit,btohqsg
If PE means anything  STA would have chiong!!!,btohqsg
It did it shot up before coming down again,btohqsg
Personal view P/E does not represent everything but is still one of the crucial ratio to look at,btohqsg
Must understand the fact that sta predominantly is rubber business and that segment is facing a headwind. So need to read more into tat.,btohqsg
Rubber selling has increased and its price has been rising,btohqsg
Actually kinda sad that the thai did not register STA > STGT in terms of shareholdings n other aspects,btohqsg
Anyways  let’s start the day  especially Monday with positivity. Let’s go!,btohqsg
Positivity attract profit  let have plenty of it.,btohqsg
No news on announcement by MT?,btohqsg
Well if the results are not optimal just got to admit it,btohqsg
"Bro furion is right in a sense when the price rocketed everyone spread ""false optimism"" that results are gonna be good etc",btohqsg
Anyway what we said here won't affect the stock price one.So no point arguing also.All comes down to how BBs want to play it,btohqsg
STA  Aspen  UG  RS  Medtec huat today ah  Vicplas funds will goes to there,btohqsg
I feel the issue is the tone and choice of words  he used,btohqsg
Depends on how you see it.It might be sarcastic but I find it witty.Anyway bro furion is a humorous guy if you see it in a right way,btohqsg
"That's why I keep warning on ""false optimism"" being spread here",btohqsg
I got warn abt VP alr.. not pure medical biz,btohqsg
Those that say buy VP before results see where they are now?,btohqsg
hope most took profits with the price spike last mon & tues,btohqsg
Ran up from 29 to 48 was a big leap already,btohqsg
Vp 2020 PE is 40+. Factor in a 30 to 50% increase in 2021 profit  still not cheap in PE terms.,btohqsg
VP also came down from 70cts+,btohqsg
Yes but it ran from few cents to 70+ also,btohqsg
today we switch focus to JT,btohqsg
JT is nothing... glove stocks better...,btohqsg
Will VP pull MT down ?,btohqsg
JT is under the radar. Up down not so many people care,btohqsg
I remember me and bro zane got zapped by someone regarding VP haha,btohqsg
Sorry just wondering  pre open market is there trading going on?,btohqsg
Wonder gke will do well this week.,btohqsg
haha we say must throw before results come out too,btohqsg
A 20+% gap dn is hard to stomach,btohqsg
yea... cuz u 2 bullshyt good result = will sell on news definitely,btohqsg
Well unlike you saying the results definitely will be good,btohqsg
Is the results really that bad?,btohqsg
Always be prepared for the worst,btohqsg
dont put words in ppl mouth anyhow,btohqsg
the one and only result i said will be good is STA only,btohqsg
Not bad just probably nvr meet expectations.,btohqsg
can earn profit in this bad bad times is good already ...,btohqsg
VP not that bas after all,btohqsg
