And yes that means the questions are harder,btohqsg
WITH ALL THE NOTATIONS AND HIGHLIGHTS,btohqsg
idk generally im ok with like the econs part in ss and geog,btohqsg
And during exam they’ll just perform random checks on people,btohqsg
Can literally be learnt in 30hours,btohqsg
i heard econs is like geog,btohqsg
But take forever to learn how to apply,btohqsg
Its more practical than other subs still,btohqsg
I’m hoping I even make it ngl,btohqsg
people say its more versatile lor,btohqsg
My o levels I’m not very confident,btohqsg
Btw when you do chem in jc need keywords,btohqsg
Thats why dont even need to read much,btohqsg
Like in sec sch is just abt keywords,btohqsg
But I don’t take a math,btohqsg
i heard hybrid harder to be successful,btohqsg
Never really concerned myself with keywords,btohqsg
In pure chem u need or no need?U got ur answer?,btohqsg
I wonder how u got an A then,btohqsg
making the best out of the worst,btohqsg
Cambridge marker be going brrrr at John Smith,btohqsg
if what our friends here say is true.... then the worse JCs are better due to the greater amount of support,btohqsg
for eg economic impacts of tourism,btohqsg
Doesn't mean higher cut off point correlates to more support,btohqsg
Just cos a jc is 20 point doesnt mean its useless,btohqsg
What top tier JCs have to offer is not in the aspect of academics,btohqsg
Remember those JCs have lesser opportunities,btohqsg
That rly defeat the purpose the of learning chem,btohqsg
econs wayyyy more indepth and maybe harder than what u see in geog,btohqsg
I mean if u think like that,btohqsg
I also dont think u will go far in life also,btohqsg
the econs in geog is v common sense i rmb it the best,btohqsg
Is like if you like a subject then you failed cuz of keywords,btohqsg
Competitions etc. To build your portfolio,btohqsg
Research  VIA  CCA  competitions  scholarships  internships,btohqsg
And just the name of the school itself,btohqsg
but ye econs in jc issa gd choice,btohqsg
To add on  even some of the current lower tier JCs do offer them,btohqsg
My friend from neighbourhood sch say no opportunity at apl,btohqsg
Tell people ‘I RI’ then they all prostrate themselves,btohqsg
Even if have  it's only for top students,btohqsg
I mean  if an RI kid tells people “I RI”,btohqsg
im j scared i kennot cope in jc,btohqsg
