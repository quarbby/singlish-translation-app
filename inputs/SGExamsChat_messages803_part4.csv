My brother says to get a nvme for my lenovo ideapad,btohqsg
My part time was also boring 1-10 but actually working was like 3hrs..rest of the time on the phone,btohqsg
they reuse 2019 mye qn for 2021 mye,btohqsg
Paid $60 in total so around $10+a hr,btohqsg
but it means if you studied those r free marks :),btohqsg
got ppl still fail even after studying and looking at past year papers,btohqsg
The prob with too many rp students is they underestimate the kinds of qns open book exams could entail,btohqsg
"They keep thinking oh ""must be on my notes"" see the bloody notes  can't find snything",btohqsg
Close book easier because they need set expectations,btohqsg
ThinkPad used to build like a tank.The last easiest to repair one was T480.,btohqsg
because open book they can test any bs under the sun,btohqsg
open book harder cause open book means you prob cannot copypaste from notes,btohqsg
Precisely..if it's open book  anything can be tested,btohqsg
so they might come up with some bs sht,btohqsg
then close book alot of times if you memorise can vomit wholesale and get marks,btohqsg
But if your motherboard fucked up. It randomly drains and unable to charge  even with new batteries.,btohqsg
One of my exam questions in rp for EOY,btohqsg
the shit not even in syllabus,btohqsg
It was a full 20 marks,btohqsg
my friend sold me his i7 T480 as spare parts for RM 400 lel.,btohqsg
Rp will throw qns at you that is not in any notes,btohqsg
I've seen it for myself for a straight 2 yrs alr,btohqsg
problem is motherboard is kinda broken. No idea worth the fix lol.,btohqsg
Time go jb get laptop parts and return,btohqsg
They don't change for you anything in y2  the eoys will still test straightup non taught topics even,btohqsg
WHY THE FUCK DO I HAVE 1K+ RINGGIT AND NOT EVEN 50 SGD,btohqsg
I just use it as spare parts  for my own i5 T480 lol,btohqsg
It's been a prob in rp for years alr,btohqsg
First intro into RP is in orientation when all the new students try to log into LEO at the same time,btohqsg
Every batch will complain about how bad the wifi is  how garbage the Leo website is,btohqsg
There is even a mod where they ask you to find the faults of rp Leo 2.0,btohqsg
They changed the WiFi alr lol,btohqsg
Last time used to be even crappier,btohqsg
some student portal where lecturer upload course materials?,btohqsg
No but I'll tell you what is not  bell curve skewed to pass students,btohqsg
Yup oh yea best part about the portal,btohqsg
You can't pre read until the day before lesson,btohqsg
The poly don't want students to study beforehand,btohqsg
Or learn from the resources beforehand,btohqsg
if you have seniors  just get the materials from them. given the syllabus most likely the same.,btohqsg
They literally accept any tom dick and harry,btohqsg
Anyways after Reagan's cohort  the next cohort  70% of the mods he is taking now will be scrapped,btohqsg
His batch alr took away 40% of the mods my cohort took and redid them.Now in his batch  the diplomas were reorganized and renamed for the incoming y1's next yr,btohqsg
most likely they just retitle and recombine some subjects,btohqsg
good luck when entering Uni  and applying for credit transfers,btohqsg
What df is a credit transfer,btohqsg
My batched used java mostly  Regan's is using python,btohqsg
Skipping Year 1 mods in Uni.,btohqsg
It's auto lol for SG unis and u just get a uniform exemption based on Diploma,btohqsg
idk   never coded in Java before. Most people just study C++ in Uni and transition to Python in Industry.,btohqsg
