Just asking  is it wise to top up the YouTrip or grab using citi rewards card or using combo with amaze?,btohqsg
Hi can i ask what the card for topping petrol give good cashback,btohqsg
Just any card to top up right?,btohqsg
Paynow is free. Card top got fee if I‚Äôm not wrong.,btohqsg
Youtrip top via card: mastercard no fee  visa got 1.5% fee.,btohqsg
if i use amaze to pay local currency for agoda  do i still incur dcc charges?,btohqsg
Hi all  newbie here  I do not need to have money in my amaze to pay right? After paired with my citi reward card,btohqsg
CorrectYou just need to have sufficient credit limit on your citi rewards card,btohqsg
Now best 4MPD strategy is- Instarem + CRMC- UOB PPVAm I right?,btohqsg
Can I suggest you adopt either Citibank or UOB for miles? It will eliminate orphan points.What‚Äôs your rough spending per month like and centred around what transactions? Categories will do. Groceries  petrol etc,btohqsg
$2k on food and shopping? Hotels and flights excluded,btohqsg
No DCC when using amaze but what card can u use with Agoda thou?,btohqsg
Maybank fam n frens  have travel as one of the category right?,btohqsg
Hi can I check usually how many days it take for Maybank sg to approve credit card application for new to bank customer? Just wondering if apply now can get it before my trip to Malaysia next Mon?,btohqsg
Can I suggest a combination of UOB Lady‚Äôs card and PPV?PPV is capped at $1 110 per month with no minimum spend. Use it for payments only via watch  phone etc can easily get 4mpd. (Do not take physical card and tap)Lady‚Äôs card is flexible depending on needs (select category) and has no minimum spend and capped at $1k/$2k (Normal/Solitaire).Another one to try will be UOB Visa Signature which has a minimum spend of $1k capped at $2k for 4mpd.,btohqsg
The UOB UNI points will consolidate so it will make it very easy to convert into miles. Take note of expiry.Citibank ThankYou points tend to have a longer expiry period but the only great card to earn miles is Citi Rewards for 4mpd and it‚Äôs capped at $1k spend a month. Citibank points are also annoying because they don‚Äôt consolidate.,btohqsg
Make sense. But CRMC + Amaze can convert FCY spend to local. So can use overseas.But UOB pooling points is very good. Though the UOB PPV is reward miles for every $5,btohqsg
I got schooled on this one by Anthony awhile back üòäLady‚Äôs card and Visa Signature is very forgiving on that front as the bonus points are awarded by calendar month. So it will consolidate the spend and calculate bonus points.PPV is awarded immediately upon posting so you‚Äôll feel the $5 block more,btohqsg
Hahaha make sense. Maybe VS is the way to go.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt really fancy lady‚Äôs at this point. Cuz only can select 1 category. Maybe when I get pay raise den i go straight to solitaire,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt recall seeing it. Did you login to check?,btohqsg
You‚Äôre cutting it very close. I think good chance you‚Äôll miss since they don‚Äôt issue digital cards first and you need to wait for the physical card.Could be a better idea to use YouTrip or Trust or Amaze + CRMC combo.,btohqsg
can we use Citi reward  + Instarem method for Alipay?,btohqsg
Q hard  because they don‚Äôt have digital card and need physical card by snail mail. + you NTB so likely need do some credit and KYC checks. Usually more than 1 week lead time one.Best you can do is to keep calling Maybank hotline lol,btohqsg
What does Est Cash balance mean in my tiger brokers? Is that liquid cash? I can‚Äôt seem to withdraw it,btohqsg
Exactly what I am looking for! Thanks for the post!,btohqsg
UOB got no offer for existing credit card holder signup promotion ya?,btohqsg
If you dont count uob visa infinite metal üòÜ,btohqsg
Userüï∂has 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:suspicious request,btohqsg
Anyone experience CRMC doesn‚Äôt give bonus points on ShopBack transactions and citi customer care say it didn‚Äôt get an online indicator from the merchant?,btohqsg
You use Apple pay to pay ?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  is there any similar promo like previous signup bonus of 1000 bonus InstaPoints instead?,btohqsg
Can someone recommend a value for money hotel in Bangkok? Maybe around $100 per night  spacious  clean  well located  come with a gym. Thank you!,btohqsg
I‚Äôve some Instarem points. I dunno how to use them?,btohqsg
Nope. CRMC card added to ShopBack app.,btohqsg
I have stayed at the quarter by uhg. They have quite a few properties and not too ex.,btohqsg
Just saw my EGA interest crediting ( for August promo ) it shows for month of sep  when will I get the second payment ?,btohqsg
Did you mean month of Aug?,btohqsg
Ohh. Then that should be correct. Aug and Sep should have been credited in. What do you mean by second payment? Oct promo?,btohqsg
I mean I should get another portion of interest for August month. The amount is only partial,btohqsg
So... You increased ADB for both Aug and Sep?,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt add on or wd anything within these months,btohqsg
I thought there are 2 crediting by end of this month ?According to the amount I had there it seems I‚Äôm missing more,btohqsg
Has anyone got UOB earmark the fund for the latest Save Up promo ?,btohqsg
