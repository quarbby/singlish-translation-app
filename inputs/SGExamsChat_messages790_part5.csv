Wait thats a very generous criteria to be eligible for H3  no?,btohqsg
‚Äúthe rest‚Äù inclusive of GP?Yea  what you are thinking is sensible,btohqsg
Not all schools‚Äô internal exams are of the same standards so every school can set their own criteria,btohqsg
Q26. ‚ÄúNothing. I got no money‚Äù,btohqsg
no bro u need to insert all the wrong answers,btohqsg
I think thats on paper only cause my senpai say her friend got rejected from h3 Econs cause hearsay her promos got 1 B. but could be due to other factorsThey would have some form of selections or interviews beforehand i think to determine if you can take. so if you fail the selection i think also gg,btohqsg
Tuition held MYE for students and some parents KBKB about that,btohqsg
Actually I forgot üòÖ but yea I think inclusive of GPI think I can pass Gp with ease though. A or not is another issue but >E is doable,btohqsg
Just do your best and trust that whatever the outcome  it is the best outcome possible,btohqsg
actually can connect everything to hops üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
its another way of saying swimming,btohqsg
i now realise this may have been overkill,btohqsg
lemme weigh it when i get home,btohqsg
wonder if i shld return it,btohqsg
the idea was my mom n i have seperate powerbanks,btohqsg
with packaging so maybe like -20g,btohqsg
Some mala store auntie call me mei nu,btohqsg

Hi did anyone here receive mindef letter to enlist for diploma (I‚Äôm still studying),btohqsg
Am I suppose to leave it as it is or do smt about it,btohqsg
üôèüèª I just told my friend to send me the content of his letter  problem solve alr thanks,btohqsg
Should see the big BoisAnker Powerhouse 535 Portable Power Station  512Wh Portable Generator 500W 7-Port Outdoor Generator:https://sg.shp.ee/2nGBVsq,btohqsg
mindef letter? its just a letter. unless its specified the location of enlisting...you are not actually enlisting,btohqsg
So can leave it as it is?,btohqsg
that has a more specific use case,btohqsg
a phone is ard 5000mah so 10k is alrdy good enuff,btohqsg
and most laptops need >50w anyways,btohqsg
fyi usually 20k mAh batt are not indicative of actual capacity,btohqsg
The technical side of it is complicated  but the rule is simple. The actual capacity of a power bank is about 2/3 of the capacity indicated. The rest disappears due to voltage conversion or is lost during charging  especially as heat.,btohqsg
if anyone is wondering why ur power bank runs out so fast when charging stuff when it shldn't,btohqsg
Heyo there's goes the cute anime sticker,btohqsg
just checked and nth on pg yet but they mentioned it during assembly,btohqsg
I‚Äôm thinking that it would be too sensitive to name it ‚Äúmock prelim‚ÄùBut just like what a really really very very old ah pek had once said ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet‚Äù üåπ,btohqsg
had to google the quote lol,btohqsg
Haha it‚Äôs like the only O level lit thing that I remember ‚Äî and not because I took lit  but my friends who took lit kept telling me about this quote,btohqsg
Wait till u find out your 1TB drive isn't 1TB,btohqsg
im surprised that word is not flagged,btohqsg
My 4tb ssd was actually only 3.4tb!,btohqsg
Damn they be eating 0.2tb per increment on 1tb,btohqsg
No this can't be... it says I am 102% African with a 2% margin of error. WHY LORD WHY?!?!,btohqsg
The more important information would be what sample they require,btohqsg
my moms fren bought this and its so fking good,btohqsg
Hihi i planning study for Os as priv candidate while in NS so i can go poly after. I just kena pes e9. How long will it take to get my enlistment date ah? N how's e9 in NS?,btohqsg
E9 in NS will definitely have plenty of time to study for Os,btohqsg
Maybe even some colleagues to help you out if they took the same subjects,btohqsg
studying might be your best use of time in NS if you‚Äôre E9 tbh,btohqsg
Yeah at least you wouldve accomplished something in the 2 years instead of wasting it (me),btohqsg
