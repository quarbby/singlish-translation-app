Hi. my UOB lady card is under the dinning category. If I were to spend on dinning overseas  does it classified as dinning (to earn 6mpd) or travel category (no bonus pts)?,btohqsg
Travel is specific to hotel and airlines sort.Dining is restaurant and food eateries.,btohqsg

"I would like to DCA into specific SG stocks like DBS  OCBC etc  and found that Poems have Share builders plan / RSP to do so  but with 1% net dividend charge.1) Is there other stock brokerages offering this kind of ""fractional"" shares like POEMS  for SG stocks?2) The 1% net dividend charge is on the dividend amount  or is something like expense ratio fee? E.g. my portfolio is 2k  my dividend is $60. I assume 1% is on $60?3) Is this charge worth it or should I just go with another broker and/or save up $$ to buy 100 stocks at one go?",btohqsg

Hello  just want to check. I recently got my UOB lady's  card and just set up my UOB one acct last week.I've  already used the UOB lady's  card a few times   however on the UOB tmrw app  it shows that all my transactions  are pending and spending on the Lady's  card is $0  as such on my interest tracker it is also showing nil credit card spend as well.Would just like to check if anyone faced this issue before/ do i need to wait a few working days for my credit card transactions  to show on the UOB interest tracker?,btohqsg
wait until the transactions are posted  not pending,btohqsg
Wait for 2 rounds of posting:1). Posted in Credit card2). Then posted in UOB tracker.,btohqsg
