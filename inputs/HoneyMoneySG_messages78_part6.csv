Should be gone. Card rewards is with the bank. FFP points (like Krisflyer) is with Krisflyer. Do cash out your points first before u cancel the card (especially sinec this isn't a co-brand card),btohqsg

Hi friends  anyone has any experience with the moneysmart promo? if its for citi rewards  i paid for a private hospital  bill using amaze  it counted as my 4mpd on the card  will it also count towards my $500 eligible spend for the gift reward?,btohqsg
So what will be another alternative card? As I thinking to purchase 3x air ticket with SQ to jpn next yr. But check out Citi rewards don't think it cover travels.,btohqsg
Furthermore  I think UOB lady card only providing 6mpd for the first 1k only,btohqsg
if can upgrade to uob solitaire 6mpd for $3k,btohqsg
should be eligible based on TnC,btohqsg
Worst case UOB KF? 3mpd uncapped on SIA group,btohqsg
