Whats your rpm when cruising at 90,btohqsg
Later I check the rpm again,btohqsg

Cannot be ahNext time we go JB cruise,btohqsg
Tell lies faster than gear change,btohqsg
Have anyone tried attrage top speed,btohqsg
I'd be surprised if it even hits 180 or 160,btohqsg
U can make a guess based on the hp and kerb weight,btohqsg
I would say not above 170,btohqsg
Their brochure says 170  so probably 160 is attainable under road conditions,btohqsg
Attrage is so light tho. Iâ€™d be worried about the traction more than anything else,btohqsg
Kia koup  I can push to 180,btohqsg
The car dont feel solid haha,btohqsg
Anyone here using NETS motoring card with auto top up?,btohqsg
