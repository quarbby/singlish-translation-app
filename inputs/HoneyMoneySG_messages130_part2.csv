I‚Äôm new to Amaze.. Consider going open Amaze. My spending is like local daily spending less than 1k.. Usually around 700 to 900. Can Amaze be link to PayPal? Using PayPal for USD for some subscriptions. Once in awhile would exceed 1k for big tickets.. What are the Mastercard to pair with amaze? I don‚Äôt really want use Citibank cards. Will be using Amaze on apply pay.,btohqsg
Oh I do buy foreign currency online.,btohqsg
After Oct 1  amaze can only used ideally with Citi rewards master card (maybe ocbc rewards and Maybank too). Not a lot of choices left.And reading ur use case  I don't think amaze is a good fit.,btohqsg
U join amaze at a bad time.Only left Citibank and Ocbc and Maybank works well with amaze.,btohqsg
Hi just wanted to ask a simple question. Currently I have paired my citi rewards card with Instarem. And have converting the points from citi rewards to kris flyer miles. Just curious  what will be the best way to convert the citipoints?I feel that normal cashback with rate of 2.27% might not be that great but Krisflyer seems like a good deal so far,btohqsg
Thks. Finally received the uob lady card yesterday  that is almost 1 week.  Now would like to consult if buy travel insurance  hotel booking  and all the usual overseas spending like tickets for place of interest  restaurant and shopping  they are under the Travel category? Again  thks.,btohqsg
No. Dining related transactions will still be under dining category  excluded transactions will still be excluded.If your travel is from Oct onwards  remember to use the card by itself instead of linking through Amaze.You might want to re-read the t&cs.,btohqsg
Have you checked what's your MAB for Aug?,btohqsg
Actually what is ifast business? I have read in their website  but still not understood  only for business? High networth? Anything for common people?,btohqsg
Tq and the link by mouse hunter is very useful.  Seems that lots of discussion on amaze and pairing but still trying to figure out what they are. Thks a lot.,btohqsg
For new users  who deposit 100k into Cashplus & hold for 90days  does it mean that there is no need to perform the 3 & 8 buy trades at the 3k & 10k level?,btohqsg
Has anyone apply for the UOB CashPlus?It's on promotion: 0% EIR for 4 months and no normal feehttps://www.uob.com.sg/personal/borrow/personal-financing/cashplus.page,btohqsg
His MAB for August will be 805.28- 73.53 =731.75,btohqsg
Just realised the bottom part. So confusing at first,btohqsg
Haha yea. He took alot of effort to type out all the transactions,btohqsg
You need to have 731.75  + 500 for your MAB for this month. Ideally put in some buffer,btohqsg
I'm going to assume that your spreadsheet tracking is based on the transactions on your OCBC app.You need at least $1318 in your OCBC 360 account from today onwards to be able to meet Save criteria.,btohqsg
For those using Cardup  may I know which are the cards being used ?,btohqsg
You can go to CardUp's website for the list of eligible cards. Their calculator also can give you the reward amounts.,btohqsg
Wah. You gotta test mcc first. A few candidates: dbs wwmc  citi rewards + amaze and uob kf.,btohqsg
I am considering a hotel banquet and hence it is a big ticket spend. Is there a good advisable card for this use ? I am open to miles as well as cash backs. Would like to maximize rewardsSaw the below listed ones for another big ticket spend convo earlier in this chat:UOB lady solitaire 2kDBS woman 1.5kUOB ppv 1.1kCrmc + amaze 1kUOB KF the rest,btohqsg
That restaurant accepts kris+. Your hotel banquet will need slightly different set of cards.Check this outhttps://youtu.be/ZhpIF6v8K6U,btohqsg
Need to perform  via cash plus subscription is ok,btohqsg
Morning! Anyone has any DP on whether is it easy to get annual fee waiver for the UOB one card?,btohqsg
Use more than 24 times a year. Should be no issue.,btohqsg
Hi all  existing Vicom cardholder get discount when going for car inspection still ?,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt use for 9 months. Thinking wan to use for this last quarter because I seem to be spending quite a bit on the bonus category merchants like Shopee and grab. But dunno if can get fee waiver or not,btohqsg
I think yes. I went recently they tried to get me to sign up saying annual discount.,btohqsg
Then it‚Äôs shaky. Make sure annual fee month is not before your payout month.,btohqsg
They seem to have included a min spend requirement for this discount at vicom  hence asking here for confirmation.,btohqsg
It will definitely be. My last quarter ends Nov so payout in Dec which is when I will get charged my annual fee. So better not to use ?,btohqsg
Must be very precise.What date is your payout and what date is your annual fee.Because if payout and annual fee date is the same.Eg 2nd December. Still can make it.U can spend the Cashback awarded. Then cancel the card. (For Uob ok  scb no ok),btohqsg
Cap at $60. Account only can open between 18-26,btohqsg
Does car servicing counts towards crmc x10 points if paired with amaze?,btohqsg
Hello all. What is a good miles card for single big purchases (5k and above) locally?,btohqsg
What are you buying and do they allow split payment?,btohqsg
Uob PPV if use in app purchases like fair price / ride hailing wont get 4mpd?,btohqsg
1 time then just whack amex plat charge signup bonus. Maybe qualify for 10x too.,btohqsg
Do challenger do split payments ( not installment )?I am also puzzled or only certain shops do that ?,btohqsg
get 4mpd in $5 blocks only if mcc is whitelisted for online transactions,btohqsg
Challenger can split payment if not crowded.I split my payment when I bought a single unit of iPhone I think $2000.Just be careful Uob ppv has problems being recognised at challenger for rewards if u use applepay.,btohqsg
Ya. You can be clearer on ur requirements then we can give better recommendations,btohqsg
That's great I was stressed this whole time glad got people ask toothank you so much üôè,btohqsg
Just need to buy a gift. Once in a while affair,btohqsg
Anyone have any idea what mcc those small online food shops come under?I'm making an order from jett barbecue but i'm wondering what they classify as,btohqsg
Test with amaze + empty wallet?,btohqsg
"As long as I link the wallet(empty) and leave the card as ""unlinked"" it'll work right",btohqsg
If already have 100k committed in the account. Can we then do $1 x 8 times cash plus subscription to fulfill the 8+3 trades?,btohqsg
