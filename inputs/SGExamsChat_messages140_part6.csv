guys I need some advice 😫 so I’ve gotten B3 but wasn’t happy abt it cuz technically the school gave me a targetted score of A2 and even the Teachers were kinda disappointed cuz they think I can do betterHowever becuz I’m from NA so if I convert to N-Level I will still get A1  I have mixed feeling abt whether I shld rlly retake or just leave it becuz everyone is telling me I’m just wasting my time??,btohqsg
one year just to save one grade,btohqsg
I mean if u don’t plan on going to O levels,btohqsg
Are u intending to go JC? If not  no point taking Chinese also   use the time to study for the other subject for the L1R4,btohqsg
And trust me  if u don't retake  what happen in my sch was all the Chinese lessons became free period and those time can really be used for all other subjects,btohqsg
Not just JC  o levels in general,btohqsg
But anyway if the only reason to retake is pride  I don’t really recommend it  unless ur chinese that important to you,btohqsg
If you have confidence and/or is aiming to get A1 then retake. And/or if u feel this 2-point difference will matter  then yes retake. Every decision depends on your ultimate goal.,btohqsg
That time i got B4 and retook cos i knew chinese was a good chance to get A1 compared to some other subjects,btohqsg
Don't waste time. Look at what you wanna do in life,btohqsg
what does the economics subject teach in jc? trying to plan a subj combi right now,btohqsg
It teaches about markets and the economy of a country,btohqsg
If u want that A sure u can go retake but since u know it’s alr equivalent A in Ns then retaking to get A is kinda pointless if u are not moving on to O levels next year,btohqsg
Yes thisBut this stage is stepping stone for them lo,btohqsg
Well just depends on whether he’s going to take Os next year,btohqsg
And lots of essay writing right?,btohqsg
Coz for O level subjects B3 converts to A1 in Ns,btohqsg
Like H1 is purely case study qn,btohqsg
Oh h1! And no essay? So good??,btohqsg
The format is 2 sets of case studies 45 marks each,btohqsg
Well there’s no essay qn but like sometimes people would say the high marks qn works like an essay qn,btohqsg
But at least u have the extract as evidence,btohqsg
So is like o levels ss and history,btohqsg
But u write a lot more,btohqsg
H2 has essays+essay has higher weightage,btohqsg
And essay is a separate paper,btohqsg
Ya this one is the tedious one,btohqsg
Plus u have a more content than the H1 counterpart,btohqsg
But some people are weak at case study qn so rip,btohqsg
H1 econs essay carried my grade though because 'model answers' can be memorised ;(,btohqsg
Agreed. Essays are way easier than case studies.,btohqsg
just curious how is econs like in jc,btohqsg
im deciding if im taking econs,btohqsg
It's split between microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics is Demand and supply  market failure etc.Macroeconomics is  inflation  trade etc.,btohqsg
Personally  I enjoyed it. Although it was frustrating as a lot of things are watered down,btohqsg
So you don't get the full picture or things don't really make complete sense  as they cut things out,btohqsg
Maybe looking at past papers would help you come to a decision,btohqsg
You are expected to draw diagrams like this,btohqsg
They say lots of essay writing and is like very humans subject,btohqsg
