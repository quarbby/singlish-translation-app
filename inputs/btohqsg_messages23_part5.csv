You applying for June/Oct sales launch?,btohqsg
Which area is there for oct bto im unsure if to apply this June or wait but have no clue which estate for oct,btohqsg
I called HDB before. There's also an email screenshot from someone else in one of these chats with the same sentiment. HFE's loan amount will only decrease and not increase.Eg  you get a pay raise after getting your HFE letter  no increase in loan amount. There is no recalculation at key collection.,btohqsg
Unless of cos you fall under one of these categories :)Feel free to call HDB to double confirm! They know best :>,btohqsg
So far we know there is Kallang Whampoa and Bayshore in OctoberOthers - unknown,btohqsg
Doesn't not make sense  actually...Less income = higher grantHDB doesn't ask for any return of the grant when income increasesAbility to pay back the loan is tied to income  so concern is raised primarily when income decreases...,btohqsg
wait for June sales launch then you'll know where's the exact location for October sales launch..,btohqsg
Wait for june bto to be out and oct sales launch plots will be shown as well,btohqsg

Hello  my partner and I submitted our payslips and other documents for HFE letter back in early May. Then we recently got notified hdb need my partner’s monthly income letter which requires HR to be involved and they only give 3-4 working days to get it done or we won’t have our hfe letter . Has anyone faced the same? Do you know why they are doing this? What did yall do?,btohqsg
Have you guys contacted HR for the income letter?When did HDB send the notification to you and what was the deadline given?Giving only 3 - 4 days seems an unusual move on HDB's partThere was another person who received SMS and was given 2 weeks to furnish the documentsNot uncommon for HDB to do soWhy - they require additional supporting documents to assess how much loan and/or grant you can getWhat to do - contact HR and ask for the required documents and submit  contact HDB if you need more time and ask if they can extend the grace period,btohqsg
"""they only give 3-4 working days to get it done"" you meant HDB or HR?perhaps  you can negotiate with HDB to buy more time aka few working days. or your partner can let the HR know that you both are applying for this HFE and needs the document as soon as possible.",btohqsg
Has anyone here been requested to submit commission statement/letter for HFE application even after submitting payslips and income letter? If yes  why was there an additional need for it and what did y'all do about it. Based on definition  income letter and commission statement/letter seems to be the same thing.,btohqsg
I haven't heard of commission letter before but it sounds like applicant has income that fluctuates?Maybe HDB wants to know the base and commission for more accurate assessment?,btohqsg
Yeah I was working part time before getting a full time job but they aren't commission based jobs. So wondering why they still need commission statement which in HDB's definition is the breakdown of income when the payslips already clearly have the income details in them.,btohqsg
I have the same issues with you  log in to your corporate website and you can attained from there.,btohqsg
My corporate website only have payslips. No commission statement or letter.,btohqsg
Hi everyone I'm reaching out to see if anyone has had a similar experience with their HFE and HDB loan eligibility. I was previously self-employed and contributing to my CPF myself  which affected my loan eligibility. However  I am now fully employed with a company that contributes to my CPF  and it's been a month in this new role.I'm trying to determine if I am now eligible for an HDB loan or if I still need to prove 12 months of employment under these new conditions. Has anyone navigated this situation before? Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated.Thank you!,btohqsg
You probably have to wait few more months if you want to use income or CPF documents related to your new employmentCut off is 2 months before applying for HFEIf you apply this month  income documents should be until April's,btohqsg
Thank you very much! It’s very helpful,btohqsg
Ask your HR to issue the letter,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/hdb-cautions-property-agents-against-misuse-of-flat-portal-amid-rise-in-hfe-letter-applicationsmaybe will take longer for HFE application,btohqsg
HDB wants additional supporting documents  doesn't matter ask HR also no difference in the salaryI submitted 12 months payslips and CPF statement and was subsequently asked for additional documentsThe 12th month payslip that i submitted was what i had  but not the 12th month that HDB was looking forAlso asked for 4 months of payslips that were before the 12th month which i thought had been submitted earlierMaybe they needed verification of some sort. Just submit together with the correct 12th month since they ask,btohqsg
Esp when it comes to grant  probably those are taxpayers' monies?So  good that they are stringent with these things,btohqsg
