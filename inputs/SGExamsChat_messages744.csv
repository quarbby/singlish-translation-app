This was speaking from my tutor‚Äôs experience. He had students who had difficulty in grasping concepts but up to a levels they followed his advice of copying model essays so as to memorise their answers  most of them got at least a B,btohqsg
But doing this exact thing is a skill,btohqsg
Who can just sit there dunno what is going on and memo answers,btohqsg
Why would that someone come up and say yes,btohqsg
I mean the person i dont know them well so its ok ig,btohqsg
Yeah so I mean like some basic level of competency. Like they understand only at a surface level so they know when it‚Äôs appropriate to regurgitate stuff even if they aren‚Äôt able to answer the qn properly,btohqsg
@pobbyyshould i do bio or chem now,btohqsg
If you have a basic level of competency memorising should at least be good enough for a C,btohqsg
the answer will Always be bio,btohqsg
Even the guy who doesn‚Äôt know how to differentiate between dd and qdd can get B,btohqsg
bro fr was asking y3 y4 uni stuff,btohqsg
It doesnt mean everyone is capable of an econs miracle,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre saying you‚Äôre from TM,btohqsg
1 guy or even 1 sch is not to be generalized to the whole population,btohqsg
We certainly know the TMs in this chat by now,btohqsg
been in tm for 10+ years,btohqsg
Yeah but legit my tutor was saying a lot of his last minute students who joined just followed his advice of doing essays then self marking  then copying the answer wholesale and it worked,btohqsg
going to be his 100th anniversary in tm soon,btohqsg
Hmm my gut feeling is gude is from ri or ny,btohqsg
I finally know what is this,btohqsg
I hv no brain capacity to guess other ppl‚Äôs school coz it does not matter,btohqsg
But u can guess fr the outside elite vs non,btohqsg
I‚Äôm very boliao now so yea anyway if she doesn‚Äôt want say it‚Äôs fine,btohqsg
Not saying that those elite schools have a 100% elite cohort,btohqsg

But sometimes is like  just uncontrollable  not so much about getting satisfaction of anything,btohqsg
My migraine all from heat one,btohqsg
Yes actually‚Ä¶sometimes I use actions  now more of just words,btohqsg
No cause the thing is i know I CANT and WONT SNAPS at her NOW because1. its not the right TIMING2. Its a LOSING BATTLE3. If i SNAPS NOW I HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN,btohqsg
But im just ANGRY and need to calm down,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a bad person to ask for advice coz I have anger management issues,btohqsg
Wah bruh‚Ä¶this person can get angry over door,btohqsg
Ok so I used to be very easily SNAPS but now I can suppress it well in front of others,btohqsg
I just needed to vent a bit here,btohqsg
But i wont do anything irl,btohqsg
But were ur friends there to witness her,btohqsg
No because ALL MY FRIENDS TAKE H2 PHYSICS,btohqsg
the amount of rage in rp,btohqsg
U dun choose a subject becoz I wanna stick to ur friends,btohqsg

Fair enough i also give up,btohqsg

I just put it there as a public CV,btohqsg
Which is what LinkedIn should be imo,btohqsg
it's that but can be more if it fits you lor,btohqsg

I prefer the school networks ngl,btohqsg
I pay 8k I am gonna use my 8k in benefits,btohqsg

Na don't bruh not worth it. I am gonna do my internship and am the only one in my cohort,btohqsg
Oh chey u do it for the sake of that 1 line in your resume?,btohqsg
Honestly 2 things are most important that cannot look like grass patch oni,btohqsg
The rest can bs your way all u want,btohqsg
If I were YI principal I would invite ri/hci students to all the matches yi is in  then get the students to yell ‚ÄúL1R5 20‚Äù as punishment,btohqsg
Maybe only then they‚Äôll realise how insensitive their remarks were,btohqsg
I feel like that isnt fair,btohqsg
1. Not all the YI students did it so the innocent ones shouldnt be punished2. I dont think its right to fight fire with fire in this context3. Idt the ri hci students would be on board with it. Ppl will say ri hci elitist.,btohqsg
This is not it‚Ä¶it is just such an immature way to do things,btohqsg
Actl the 3rd pt is the most impt tbh,btohqsg
"Yea imo its like ""you broke my toys so i must break yours""",btohqsg
I can‚Äôt think of a reason why the RI/HCI people will willing do this  they will be like what kind of principal does this,btohqsg
Hmm yeah actually. They would be more preoccupied with high flyer things,btohqsg
I was thinking that sometimes ppl need a taste of their own medicine if not they won‚Äôt learn,btohqsg
If the ri/hci principal get the letter/email from yijc principal  they prob js gonna laugh with admins and then delete or toss the letter in the trash,btohqsg
Ngl ppl brainless enough to shout stupid things at public setting while in sch uni will prob make blunders that are gonna cost them greater consequences in life,btohqsg
I would agree that words wun do anything  and I can‚Äôt think of a solution  I will just live with it and be like ‚Äòthere are just people who are like that‚Äô,btohqsg
Guys my fav athlete match is approx 3h away  idk what to do in the mean time,btohqsg
Can only hope the students who didn‚Äôt take de Silva‚Äôs scolding seriously that their own brashness would be their own undoing in the future,btohqsg
The number of stats qns in the other chat is crazy,btohqsg
But I hv returned those to the Cher Liao,btohqsg
U can do that la but honestly it's better to just do what u enjoy,btohqsg
U wan SG unis anyways so grades is king and probably all they care about,btohqsg
Depends on what pes they go to and whether they even go for ns,btohqsg
Omg I just choked on my saliva,btohqsg
It do be like that sometimes,btohqsg
Some people go through NS still their old self,btohqsg
connect with people you know then people they know  then people you wanna know,btohqsg
It is them  nothing got to do with anyone,btohqsg
and then sometimes job applications can just put your linkedin or if you go career fairs they sometimes exchange linkedin too lol,btohqsg
i know quite a few people that got job offers that way,btohqsg
just by talking to people on linkedin,btohqsg
as in they got referred and had better odds of securing an interview,btohqsg
There are ppl who do not change after ns,btohqsg
not mutually exclusive to what i'm saying,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure my friend has been telling me I‚Äôm over-estimating what ns can do,btohqsg
What kind of stuff could happen in uni,btohqsg
Yeah eventually one hard way or another they will eventually find out,btohqsg
For pes e I think they basically don‚Äôt go through much even for saf,btohqsg
both not managed to teach them üëΩ,btohqsg
i guess no one will want to be with them,btohqsg
I think as long as mouldable can change one,btohqsg
but the funny thing is that muslim teachers all recognise one thing: that hamas is not part of palestine,btohqsg
so the correct message should be free palestine from hamas rule,btohqsg
Are they saying send de silva to the stars,btohqsg
For my friends bday coming up,btohqsg

Ur kinda living under a rocl,btohqsg
Ok tbf a handkerchief is a rare sight these days,btohqsg

This article highlights both the benefits and potential risks associated with the use of generative AI tools like ChatGPT in academia. While it acknowledges the convenience these tools offer under academic pressure  it also warns about negative consequences such as procrastination  memory loss  and compromised academic performance. The study discussed sheds light on the usage patterns among university students  but it also acknowledges limitations such as the possibility of bidirectional relationships and the need for further research to explore the broader effects on learning outcomes and health. Expanding this research through experiments could provide deeper insights into the impacts of excessive generative AI usage on students.,btohqsg
Leverage to my personal risk tolerance,btohqsg
Na it's just unlucky with the face cards lor,btohqsg
At least u got a good hand tho like its smth u can play on,btohqsg
For me even if I hit something with face card lanpa the river will always fuck me over,btohqsg
Yala that one is a noble death bro,btohqsg
The river death is the most painful,btohqsg
Na bro it's either a shameful death or a noble death,btohqsg
Exactly lmao no fun one that one,btohqsg
Mf flopped 3 of a kind,btohqsg
Bruh if he raise immediately after flop legit I would be damn cautious liao,btohqsg
But then again depends on how much is in the pot preflop la,btohqsg
Bruh lmao u were aiming for high card advantage,btohqsg
Lmao I damn scared of straight and flush draws,btohqsg
a person who lives at far north only qualifies for jp n yi,btohqsg
but he wld rather go jp even if its far af?,btohqsg
but if the comparison is like he wld rather go ri than yi (if he qualifies for ri) even if yi is the nearest to his house he wld still rather go ri,btohqsg
then thats p reasonable id say,btohqsg
u lose all ur money in limp pots,btohqsg
limp pots r the most dangerous,btohqsg
cuz ur opponent can have any 2 cards and theres no incentive for them to fold,btohqsg
thats why the correct play is to rfi (raise first in) when ur hand is good (correlates to position) and fold otherwise,btohqsg
see preflop mistakes will snowball into larger mistakes and tougher spots postflop,btohqsg
by right its def not a raise,btohqsg
but limp pot if im oop i wld bet and if i get raised i fold most of the time,btohqsg
must see position who bet first and preflop action,btohqsg
so u fold out all the retard hands that can fk u over so their ‚Äúrange‚Äù is narrowed,btohqsg
although usually we call squeeze related to 3bets,btohqsg
so like that if the flop comes some retarded wet board shit,btohqsg
u know its a lot less likely that they have,btohqsg
see what his other card is,btohqsg
mistake here is that nvr raise pre,btohqsg
AQ even off is premium hand,btohqsg
see the charts i sent u,btohqsg
earlier position u r tighten up,btohqsg
another example wld be lets say u got AKo and u DONT raise pre so 8 ppl in the hand  all limp and all got downie hands that u have no clue (or maybe not u never know),btohqsg
assuming single raise pot the chances of someone having a 4 wld be limited to just 45s 34a A4s,btohqsg
and so theres a lot lesser combos of hands that beat u in their range if u had raised pre,btohqsg
there was this other hand i had AKoi RFI out of positionopponent 3 bets prei callflop comes 565i bet 25 even tho i had nth (exploitative move dont ask me but in theory its a donkey move)he raise to 75i know his personality+his range for a fact he doesnt have shit most of the time  so i shovehe folds i was right,btohqsg
what hands are good enough to call with a 4,btohqsg
everything else is retarded and should fold,btohqsg
he would have folded pre OR not 3bet me pre lor,btohqsg
but having said that sometimes ppl 3bet bluff and i get fucked,btohqsg
this is vvvv simplified and i may have butchered some concepts for simplicitys sake and assumed other things,btohqsg
u first start is like that,btohqsg
i j said that cuz ltr some gto monster come roast me,btohqsg
oh thats actl not that small,btohqsg
lol 2 days ago every hand all in,btohqsg
i just sitting there with my $800 profit folding every hand,btohqsg
is that in the pdf i sent u,btohqsg
the poker eqv of telling someone whos starting investing,btohqsg

Bruh I'm literally paid $900 a month to sit in a office and use phone for 6hrs...what a life for a intern + company don't want me anymore within the first week üíÄ,btohqsg
It is coz ppl reply on chatgpt for their homework,btohqsg
the test is stupid hence he failed,btohqsg
Had to get 16/20  got 15/20,btohqsg
Wait why is the passing so high,btohqsg
Getting 15/20 meant after my internship  I have 0% chance of being rehired,btohqsg
There are no stupid people  only stupid tests,btohqsg
There was a 2 mark  2 blanks question. You could only score 0 or 2. That was where I lost that one mark,btohqsg
Anyways not going to work for a company with no ot pay anyways,btohqsg
900 per month till aug  basically just excel all the way,btohqsg
thats like 5k without doing anyth,btohqsg
@aforaceis it bad that im going on walk instead of doing worƒ∑,btohqsg
Yea plus the person assigned to take me to complete his project said that he is alr 90% done...so all I do is ad hoc duties,btohqsg
This is how much time I've spend on the phone in my 8:30-6 job,btohqsg
This intern will also affect my next sem gpa since it's graded,btohqsg
Omg I spent 7h on tele ytd,btohqsg
Some days my screen time also exceeds 12h,btohqsg
But idk what I could do to improve that gpa...my whole team is the lazy af kindLiterally feel like whole dept paid money to fkin lepak in office haiz,btohqsg
From what phone to what phone,btohqsg

If a event only happens once in your life or less than that once a month. It's advisable to bring as much people as you feel comfortable. That is how memories are made,btohqsg
But i feel like the number of ppl who cherish their tm journey in my batch excluding the sc can easily be counted,btohqsg
But i will ask my friends nonetheless,btohqsg
Those are still people  they are not just numbers in the mind,btohqsg
Like excluding the sc  the number of ppl who cherish the tm experience,btohqsg
Tbh is there a reason why stall 16 way more popz than stall 14,btohqsg
the numbers mean nothing to me LOL,btohqsg
Unker more popz than short hair aunty,btohqsg
idk tbh i usually go 14 bc i just get bottle drinks and there got less people,btohqsg
to the point the auntie recognise me also,btohqsg
i usually go 16 cause their drinks are in a cooler and you can just take urself,btohqsg
The japanese stall aunty knows me alr,btohqsg
Cause i keep buying her food,btohqsg
