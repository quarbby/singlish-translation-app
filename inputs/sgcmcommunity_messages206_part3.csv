finally new civic. this one seems much much better than the previous which i dont see many on the roads. finally LED headlights too,btohqsg
Any headlights not LED at this day and age should b a crime.,btohqsg
Interestingly  you can retro fit LED lights in the head lamp of older cars. However  it's illegal in SG.,btohqsg
illegal because it may be too bright and not properly calibrated whereas factory fitted LED is properly calibrated to not be too glaring,btohqsg
some illegal ones look ok but some others are just super blinding,btohqsg
It's similar to owners who change the light bulbs to the super bright halogen type which blinds other road users. But it's so bright in SG  no point doing that. I did that when I was studying overseas  the extra brightness helped because the outskirts of town is so poorly lit.,btohqsg
finally  waited for so long  end up I bought a CLA  haha,btohqsg
many cars on road has overly bright headlight. so disturbing,btohqsg
White may be bright  but throw not very far,btohqsg
Some put white but don't dip their lights,btohqsg
