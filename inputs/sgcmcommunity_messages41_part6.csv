Wearnes have to pay Volvo Cars the distribution rights and because they sell so little cars  they must collect high premium to be profitable.The risk Wearnes dare not take is to lower the price. Maybe if they decrease their premium for 33-40% down to 20-30%  they might be able to sell more cars. In essence  they collect less premium per car but sell more cars hence making more in overall profits. Premium x Quantity= total revenue. Q increase more than proportionately to P decrease. They can also make more money from servicing and maintenance.The only problem they face is the uncertainty that they dont sell more cars and end become loss making. Thats on the risk appetite of Wearnes.Overall  i believe if they decrease premiums when coe stagnate or is low  this business model will have a higher chance of working.,btohqsg
Also  wearnes dont even have any events for owners unlike the other makes which make the owner-Wearnes bond alittle further compared to other AD. Maybe having this events might help in heir marketing... who knows.,btohqsg
