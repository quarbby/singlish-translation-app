How do you know what's inside you unless you test yourself? Don't do one push-up  do 100. Don't run one mile  run a marathon. Don't have one family  have a second family all the way across the country. Don't just have a second family  have a third family in Santa Fe with an alternative lifestyle. Don't spend any time with the first two families  make a commitment to family number three  and double down by announcing it at his war-hero father's retirement party. Don't go to the funeral  'cause  remember  you got two other families to deal with and a marathon to train for. Don't just let Kenneth walk out of your life  take his life from him. Don't just go to jail  go to death row by killing the other two families. Don't just let anyone have their closure by apologizing  send a message that you're not afraid of hell. Nike. You may not know this  but our full name is Nichael.,btohqsg
Yall talk as if WhatsApp is a for profit venture,btohqsg
I doubt Meta makes shit from that they probably bought it only for market share,btohqsg
WhatsApp is a very small part of Facebookâ€™s overall revenue. It generates almost all of it from WhatsApp for Business  which charges businesses for usage after 1 000 conversations.,btohqsg
It's an estimate btw we don't know the numbers,btohqsg
I mean it's not big enough for Meta to even give a shit about em in their 10-K,btohqsg
Youtube found out years ago... hosting content is really fucking expensive to maintain,btohqsg

Yea I think you have to DSA and your PSLE should be above a certain cut off (it's def not >250 though),btohqsg
