Or does a lawyer merely needs to communicate,btohqsg
no need differentiate the clients chances of going jail,btohqsg
there is sure some sort of analytical skills involved in law  but that is also included humanities subjects,btohqsg
Competitiveness will definitely increase  not because of within SG  but because our neighbours are progressing at a very fast rate,btohqsg
hate to break it to you but not really,btohqsg
That's because you are only considering the learning of subjects at their surface level.That isn't the purpose of education.,btohqsg
I feel that Singaporeans are generally good in math because it's a step by step basis  like  you see this qn  what method do I apply. whereas in gp/humanities subj  you really have to think it thru and apply analytical skills,btohqsg
Wait pocoyo random but everytime I look at your pfp I will think that it has a short flat hair,btohqsg
u need to fix my hair now,btohqsg
yeah this is true i kinda got tired of math cos the way it was taught to me is like memorize how to answer this kind of qn,btohqsg
so i ended up sucking at math then now i doing social sciences,btohqsg
How do you want me to fix it,btohqsg
I memorised for GP to achieve a 2 grade jump between A level and retaking at 2nd NS.,btohqsg
guys thanks for debating with me  I love killing time by using my brain,btohqsg
how does one memorise for GP,btohqsg
memorization can get you the grades but not really improve ur writing/analytical skills overall,btohqsg
like our of all the possible topics ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
First  I systemised it to step by step as well. For essays,btohqsg
But my method may not work for others,btohqsg
see exactly  you're the taking the math approach again,btohqsg
yes  and I can get A for it. So it works,btohqsg
what did you get second time,btohqsg
that works for a level stuff but i dont think it'll work for uni and beyond,btohqsg
2nd time  scored A. English proficiency = NS languages,btohqsg
i have 3 mods this sem that require 3 different kinds of essay writing,btohqsg
as much as people say dont study for gp,btohqsg
it doesn't work for high level maths too,btohqsg
the question i did came out 3 times,btohqsg
gp method definitely wont work when u have to go write research papers in uni,btohqsg
cos its no longer memorize example go then write explanation,btohqsg
But fr leh your.pfp is like an illusion to me bruhhhhhh,btohqsg
I bought this guys notes on carrousell,btohqsg
what are your opinions of me memorising 0 examples for geography,btohqsg
so many better things to spend time on than studying for gp,btohqsg
Eh first of all ours is no bidding  just first come first serve (for non electives). Yea last time a lot of times when you try to register  the server will overload lol then must keep trying until the end of your time slot. But last year they finally forked some of the functions to their own server so itâ€™s way better now. Not perfect but better,btohqsg
to be honest  once I got the system  I only really went for 4 private 1 on 1 lessons for GP,btohqsg
i did that for my econs for my ib exams but tbh i walked out not learning anything like i memorized most of the textbook for the exams but then after the exams i just throw away and forget everything alr,btohqsg
I got someone to mark my essay,btohqsg
And for GP  only really focused on 2 things at that time. One of it was terrorism.,btohqsg
fuck I accidentally applied for a full time job HELP ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Odds are you wonâ€™t get it anyway,btohqsg
And if you do get it just reject lol,btohqsg
OH YA WAIT I SEND U SMT,btohqsg
GP comprehension  I reverted to primary school comprehension method  with some paraphrasing here and there.That was another difference between my first and 2nd papers,btohqsg
Eh simple enough. Just change the hue only,btohqsg
i feel replicating is what causes students to fail,btohqsg
ksbull is fine it's just that most students aren't even close to the skill level required to balance word flow and logical flow,btohqsg
It is the same reason when students look at worked solutions.It is never the solution that helps. It is the thinking process behind getting the solutions.,btohqsg
also checks and balances along the way,btohqsg
On the surface level  it is follow this and that method.That shouldn't be the case,btohqsg
