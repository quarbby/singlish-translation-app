Please help  anyone having trouble withdrawing their money from SNACK investments? It‚Äôs been more than 7 working days and I still have no receive my funds. (Did the Dec promotion and their investment underlying fund dropped by 3-4%),btohqsg
Do you have an NRIC linked paynow?,btohqsg
the ocbc titanium rewards has been changed and renamed to the ocbc rewards card,btohqsg
thats quite strange  whats your buy/sell price per unit?,btohqsg
Unsure  I didn‚Äôt receive automated email indicating the buy/sell price per unit. I also didn‚Äôt receive any email pertaining to my withdrawal. My email on SNACK profile is correct and I‚Äôve checked my spam/promotional folders.,btohqsg
My funds should be safe right as SNACK is tied to Income? Worried that snack might do a rug pull,btohqsg
Think best you ask support about your case  Shouldn't be that long but weird u don't get any emails,btohqsg
Some bank (i forget which) actually need 12 months not a holder (in full)  so 13 months to be extra extra safe,btohqsg
Is the investment fund empty already?,btohqsg
Hmm  maybe get someone to paynow via nric to make sure that works,btohqsg
I didnt have any prob selling and receiving the money fr snack.,btohqsg
As payment was made by credit card  how did u received the payment from snack? Credit back to card?,btohqsg
No  to your account that is linked with nric,btohqsg
Yes. To your NIRC. I have no issue received the payment from snack.,btohqsg
For me. I forget roughly how many days. But is confirm earlier than the day they stated.,btohqsg
I email them since yesterday also no reply until now üòî,btohqsg
Anyone tried to sell OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan (BCIP) stocks purchased using SRS?OCBC charges 0.3%  expensive!Although it is BCIP  it is technically SRS stocks w agent bank. Thinking if can sell through Poems Cash+ - sell from SRS holdings.Call Ocbc  they of course say no.I can‚Äôt transfer BCIP securities to CDP also since they are purchased w SRS.Any ideas?,btohqsg
What if close OCBC SRS and change SRS to DBS?,btohqsg
You can try to do interbank transfer of SRS account  similar to CPF-IA.You need to physically go to the branch of the bank you want to transfer to  and queue for counter services. Then inform the service officer that you want to do an interbank transfer of your SRS account.Bring along your physical IC and standby your original SRS account number.You will need to signTWOforms. New SRS account and transfer of SRS account.For CPF-IA interbank transfer  it's the same process  just that instead of SRS account number  you standby your original CPF-IA number.,btohqsg
Thanks! Wonder if the BCIP SRS stocks would move to new agent bank or not.,btohqsg
Should be fine I think. They allow you to invest in another agent bank even if your SRS account is not under them. Vice versa. But you should check with the service officer to confirm.,btohqsg
The savings:If I have $100k of G3B in SRS BCIP to sell  OCBC charges 0.3% or $300.If I can move it to another SRS bank  sell through FSM  pay $8.80 flat.Worth the trouble?,btohqsg
For SRS BCIP  you cannot transfer out. Only can sell then buy in FSM one.,btohqsg
Wondering if u change SRS agent bank.. can the SRS BCIP stocks still stay w Ocbc?Guess they force u sell BCIP then,btohqsg
Best to check with CSO  maybe can come back here with the answer.,btohqsg
Guys I got approved for all the usual cards from citi dbs amex in the beginner range but got rejected for PRVI. I don‚Äôt have an account with UOB before this. Not sure why they rejected.,btohqsg
Dont bother  i want to cancel my prvi liao,btohqsg
What for u want that useless card,btohqsg
For paying rent on CardUp it‚Äôs the best beginner card(1.4MPD local spend),btohqsg
1. When was the last time you got a new cc?2. Did you miss any payments/did not pay your cc in full recently?,btohqsg
Open an account  previously they rejected me also. But when I open an account with them  instantly got approved,btohqsg
