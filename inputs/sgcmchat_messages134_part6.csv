thanks bro that one I do speedramp haha,btohqsg
What phone u use Sia q nvr,btohqsg
Last time I use Samsung shoot at night alws come out look like JAV pixels,btohqsg
the first clip actl is good resolution btw I just make it more pixelated so the second clip looks nicer HAHA,btohqsg
LOL ya most of the time same,btohqsg
unfortunately not because I forgot I could film in 8kðŸ’€,btohqsg
also tiktok doesnt support 8k so I always have to drop the resolution before posting,btohqsg
ya tiktok doesnt support more than 4k the last time I checked,btohqsg
Apple good for beginners like me cos it will autofocus HAHAH,btohqsg
Samsung got the pro mode I think if uw depth,btohqsg
oh haha actually samsung video got subject tracking,btohqsg
just click on the subject youre taking vid of and the phone will do the focusing for you,btohqsg
I just miss the like Samsung double cam cos Samsung can shoot frm back cam and front cam at the same time,btohqsg
but I keep forgetting that it exists so I alw end up not using it LOL,btohqsg
not only AF lock sometimes the phone will zoom in zoom out accordingly also,btohqsg
but other than testing out the feature  I havent actually used it haha,btohqsg
I miss the 100x zoom actually,btohqsg
okay this one I can never forget I use the 10x lens q frequently,btohqsg
the 10x lens my fav bro its super nice,btohqsg
but downside is that if uw take pic of car or what using the 10x must walk back like 3 car lengths+ away lol so I just use 3x if taking pic of car,btohqsg
but can take pic of the moon though Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯,btohqsg
my friend alw ask me for pic of moon LOL,btohqsg
This one they use ai sadly,btohqsg
If u zoom into a white ball it will turn into the moon,btohqsg
