For money market funds like tiger vault and webull moneybull   are there “better” or “worse” days to top up ? Eg days where the US bond price drops,btohqsg
Think the 1-2 days will not earn any interest  assuming you still meet the criteria for the 5%  ie salary crediting and 500 spending.,btohqsg

Thanks. I don't have those cards you mentioned.,btohqsg
your average daily balance for the month will be lower than $100k. For example if put back 1 day later in a month with 30 days  average daily balance 29×$100k/30 = $96666.67. You lose 7.8%×3333.33×30/365= $21.37 of interest,btohqsg

Hi anyone knows how to pay income tax with credit card? Apparently citibank can only that I don't know how. Is it under citipayall? Or from tax portal?,btohqsg
This is exactly what scammers work. Stealing data at the background and making your phone as a diummy node for other hackers.It will be stupid for anyone to believe all these nonsense.,btohqsg
Better not to use main phone to do it. Just factory reset use a sub phone if anyone wanna try.Similar to those crypto project. highly risky a lot of rugpull and scam.,btohqsg

Just stop all these non-regulated Financial products discussion altogether,btohqsg

So  where do the company get the money from ? Selling you personal data to dark web ?,btohqsg
Correct  I am trying to use DBS (Local Transfer and set it under “Salary Payment” to UOB account to fulfill the $1600 salary criteria.,btohqsg
Does it work? UOB activity tracker seems to update quite slow..,btohqsg
Perhaps you can start your own channel on this topic. Rather then coming in to this channel and recommend your product.,btohqsg

Which card best use with amaze card for amazon transaction for miles earn   without limit?Most good miles card seems to have 1k max limit,btohqsg
if the MCC is right  UOB KF uncapped 3 mpd,btohqsg
But it seems like the 3mpd has a clause where there is a need to spend $800 on SIA group (excluding kris+) in a membership year,btohqsg
well can't have everything can we,btohqsg
This is correct. Note that you will be credited 1.2mpd first (1.8MPD will be credited 2 months AFTER CC year)Note that this doesn't apply to SIA-related spends (incl. Kris+)[3MPD directly],btohqsg
seems pretty inline with other miles cards out there,btohqsg
Paiseh mixed up with SCB smart - deleted my comment,btohqsg
My evaluation was the journey card was pretty inline with other miles cards. Only citi rewards + amaze was better.,btohqsg
Thing is  im lazy and want everything done with the same bank  haha,btohqsg
personal loan  credit card and everyday banking etc,btohqsg
Why trust unless using trust to pay Ntuc & kpitam will give more perk,btohqsg

"Hi all  i got a weird question that i will like to ask.. not sure if its asked before.I understand that UOB lady and PPV annual fee is automatically deducted by UNI$. UOB do approved waiver of annual fee  which i believe has to do with your spending done on the credit card monthly.What happens if i spend a ton on UOB lady  but a mini amount on PPV. Does UOB consider them as a whole and allow fee waiver for both cards ""easily""? or UOB lady will be waived  but PPV will be charged with an annual fee?In short  I'm trying to understand if fee waiver can be get without splitting my spending equally to 2 cards.. or i can just focus on 1 card will do",btohqsg
It’s likely they will consider overall spend on both cards but  to be frank  only uob can answer that question with accuracy,btohqsg
No need to think too much lol. Ask for waiver  and if they don't agree  cancel the card ✅,btohqsg
but by then means they deducted 6500 UNI$ leh.. and u dun get it back. Quite painful to accumulate 6500 UNI$. Thats about 2k+ spendings?,btohqsg
They'll return.Anyway never had issue getting waiver from UOB.No need to think too much,btohqsg
Oh? if they dun waive the annual fee  u cancel the card  they will return 6500 UNI$ back to u?,btohqsg

Hi. I am new to miles and just sign uo HSBC revolutions card. I am confuse on the mile program. Do i have to enroll hsbc mile program now and pay $40/year or i can wait until end of 37months while point expiring then start enrol and convert.Thanks.,btohqsg

if I only have enough miles for one way business class trip  can I choose economy class on my return trip? If so  will it be worth it?,btohqsg
Yes  u can do 1 way biz  one way economy. Whether it’s worth it or not depends on your valuation of a mile & how much you value the business class leg. If it’s a long flight and u manage to redeem J savers (assuming SQ)  it’s actually a decent option,btohqsg
Do search for “easy money had been made already”  you should get my views on your question. Good luck,btohqsg
i called sq hotline and the person help me with it. so if the dates you want has no seats  they can give you alternative dates without having to trial and error,btohqsg

Hi  if I top up my Starbucks card at the store itself and use PayWave like credit card  how does the bank know I’m not paying for coffee? They can only see the MCC right?,btohqsg
Yes  the cc terminal used is the same as transactions used to buy coffee  mcc no diff,btohqsg
Thanks  cos the credit card T&C say wallet top ups don’t count. But I just thought it was weird cos I don’t see how they can differentiate,btohqsg
They probably referring to grab wallet  shopee pay etc,btohqsg
Because Starbucks card credit  you can only spend in Starbucks and no where else ~ hence you are just prepaying your purchase from Starbucks ~But for grab wallet   shopee wallet   YouTrip etcThe money top up can be use to spend anyway so there isn’t data to be captured by the bank side so it isn’t worth giving points to there ~If you top up to Starbucks card  the bank can know this person love Starbucks maybe we can push Starbucks promo to this person,btohqsg
Ohhh thanks for the explanation 👍🏻👍🏻,btohqsg

calculated a little bit. currency conversion seems to cost about 0.4% each time in moomoo compared to XE currency converter rates.so for 2x conversion (to convert to usd and convert back to sgd when cashing out)  it would cost about 0.8% total. wouldnt really be worth it considering choco finance has guaranteed 4.5%,btohqsg

u do now then when ur FD matures and USD drop.... you're back to square one in SGD perspective,btohqsg

Anyone knows how changipay transactions will be recorded in terms of mcc,btohqsg
Very real issue lol. Unless u buy stocks or something with the USD.,btohqsg
The short answer is the money you put into your Chocolate account is not safe from capital losses. However  for the long answer  you need to understand these 3 things:1. Any money you put into your Chocolate account (capital) is then invested into a portfolio of fixed-income funds designed to optimise risk-adjusted returns based on duration  spread  and currency.2. Markets do go up and down and so will the portfolio value. For balances below S$20k  if the value of your portfolio is lower than your capital at any given point in time  Chocolate will top up the shortfall (on both losses incurred on capital and target returns) so you earn the 4.5% p.a. returns on your total balance. I.e: This means  while the qualifying period is live  your capital sum for balances below S$20k won't go down. Read the details for the top-up terms and conditions.3. All funds invested with Chocolate are segregated and held separately by custodians. This means if anything happens to Chocolate - your money is still safe. Think of this like a safe inside a house on fire. Stuff inside the safe is still safe. Only the balancing item will not remain safe (and this is why we can't say your capital is guaranteed).,btohqsg

Yup screenshot of payment slip and bank statement sent 850am. Have spoken to the client service manager  he/she say all good  will inform the team in charge to expedite.,btohqsg
My first experience with FAST is that the first transfer needs to be verified by their team. It took one business day for my case. DDA I think is faster as it does not need to be verified.,btohqsg
I did it this morning  was instant,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. I did $1 yesterday  it was instant too. Today transferred the balance  then need manual processing. Already got credited.,btohqsg
can consider i guess   just that it have currency risk. But i believe it will work,btohqsg

Chocolate vs moomoo  I think I trust moomoo,btohqsg
Another possibility for instant withdrawal is wise interest account.,btohqsg
Will the interest rate be revised yearly?,btohqsg
Which is better moomoo or webull or any other brokerages?,btohqsg
Not Tiger if you trade SGX.,btohqsg
IBKR for US stocks  moomoo for Sg stocks.,btohqsg
try not to lock card amaze card directly.either lock your link card .or amaze wallet balance is less than what you should transaction (insufficient balance),btohqsg
Yes  no difference over at moomoo..except that they don’t have the stupid custody fee if you stop trading for a quarter.,btohqsg
is Cash Management Accounts works the same as moneybull (webull)?,btohqsg
TIGER responded: If you want to avoid the fee charge and have no plan to trade in the SG market recently we can assist with your SGX sub-account closure. The SGX sub-account closure will not affect your trading activities in other markets  it will  reopen after one tradingactivity for SG stock,btohqsg
How about SGX stock dividends? Anything fees I need to watch out for? DBS Vickers comm is $11.77 for cash upfront trades which should be better for my dividend stocks held long-term.,btohqsg
Which is stupid  since some people just want to lump sum buy and sit back collect dividends. They close the account then my stock store where?,btohqsg
But that said  who knows if moomoo or Webull will also add on similar terms down the road? If you’re intending on buying for the long term (>5 years)  I personally wouldn’t touch the China brokers. Leave them for day trading/punting. Long term stocks put in locally established banks and brokers or IBKR.,btohqsg
For dividend stocks i will put CDP. For trading who should I go with?,btohqsg
Moomoo or Webull for SGX. For US  all are the same for now if you want lowest comms.,btohqsg
Webull cannot trade SGX stocks I think,btohqsg
Oo never realised that. I thought SGX was available since they have sgd funds on their moneybull program.,btohqsg

Here just to rant .... but OCBC is getting quite ridiculous in their anti-money laundering practices. Was helping my Mum apply for premier banking as she has just received proceeds from recent property sale.

Anyone knows if this is really the norm or did I just encounter an overly zealous banking officer?,btohqsg
Nothing wrong that they are asking that.,btohqsg
Anyway  just want to share about the Franklin US Opportunities Fund.

actually i got a legit question for this video on $300k cash strategy.. if you have $300k  wont it be better to put 200k in OCBC 360 account?At 200k  OCBC 360 account gives u additional 2.4% interest?Salary + Save + CC Spend + 200k Grow = 2.5% + 1.5% + 0.6% + 2.4% = 7%?isn't this like the highest and safest method as compare to money funds? Of coz under the basis that OCBC doesn't collapse... or m i counting it wrongly?,btohqsg
Hi all  i have a qn regarding DBS rewards redemption to miles.Understand each redemption is $25 for minimum 5k block.For example if i redeem on 10k block  will it become $50 ? or still $25,btohqsg
Thank you for reply  means quantity no matter how much i choose is still $25 right ? 😀,btohqsg
Yup. Still $25. Note the total will be $27 cause there's $2 GST,btohqsg
Has anyone put any money into StashAway guaranteed?,btohqsg
His $137043 parked with webull till 31 December 2023 is earning more. Its earning extra 14.4% / annum on top of Fullterton sgd returns (currently around 3.7% / annum).,btohqsg
yeah the webull one is OP  but the rest can be park in OCBC 200k? haha,btohqsg
For uob one acct if paynow 1.6k as sal qualifies?,btohqsg
Funds in Webull's Moneybull can be invested in stocks etc without any delay and still be eligible for the USD 3000 promo. This is the attractiveness of cash management accounts. Our local banks run into problems sometimes and it is not guaranteed we can have immediate access to our funds should we need to deploy them urgently in the stock markets. OCBC increase transaction limit need to wait for 12 hours  not ideal for war chest funds.,btohqsg
OCBC 7% EIR only applies to the first 100k  regardless of total deposit. Above 100k gets 0.05%. Therefore deposit of 200k will only get EIR of 3.525% not particularly attractive,btohqsg
If buy online opt for installment using dbs wwmc  still eligible for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Count wrongly. EIR for 200K in OCBC will be less than 100K in OCBC.,btohqsg
Oh is it? please enlightened me..,btohqsg
Hi all... can i hv some advice on the best credit card in Singapore for everyday use?   I already have posb everyday card  want to hv one more card as backup,btohqsg
Is this not addition? Correct me if i m wrong..,btohqsg
Added for the 100K only. But you put 200K inside. So your EIR is 3.525% for 200K. Must well put 100K in OCBC and another 100K in CIMB.,btohqsg
amount above 200k  yes gets 0.05%. I'm actually talking about exactly 200k. Then the rest outside of 200k (exactly) will be deploy to money funds.,btohqsg
what does this means then? Maintain an average daily balance of at least $200k - Grow (2.4% EIR),btohqsg
Maintain 200K  then your first 100K get 2.4% more interest.,btohqsg
Oic  looks like i been misunderstanding it totally lol.. thank you all for the sharing session,btohqsg
You can use the interest calculator below that to experiment your numbers.,btohqsg
icic  damn.. finally i learnt something about ocbc lol,btohqsg
Not OCBC fault  you just need to be extra careful,btohqsg
If u put 100k  every month u get 390. If 200k  u get 600,btohqsg
Meaning the the additional 100k will earn u 200 more per mth..,btohqsg
If u hv 100k extra  suggest to put other place like RHB FD which will give u 3.6% Per Annum with 3600  equivalent to 300 per mth which is more then the 200 per mth for the 2nd 100k u put with OCBC,btohqsg
addtional 100k should just put in UOB,btohqsg
Yeah.. UOB One also can for the 2nd 100k.. but must meet UOB One criteria to get 400 per mth,btohqsg
uob can stack with xmas savings promo,btohqsg
For cash management account liquidity is key  for immediate deployment into stock markets. Cannot compare with savings accounts and FDs  by the time funds are transferred out  might lose window of opportunity,btohqsg
easy to hit.can just charge insurance premium to uob debit. for me i have $500/mth endowment plan.for salary credit just transfer from another account and set transfer purpose to SALA.,btohqsg
Any idea abt estimated yield for T bill?,btohqsg
These days one year yield lower than 6 mth,btohqsg

Why not put RHB FD at 3.6%?,btohqsg
Can one use DBS ATM to apply for T-bill? Somehow I could not find the option in the machine,btohqsg

Some banks have more verification e.g singpass before they disburse the cash.,btohqsg
If I have Singpass and bank apps on a separate phone which I don't use for social media and online transactions  am I safe?,btohqsg
The phone also has to be completely up to date with the latest updates and security patches. Also on a separate phone number that isn’t used anywhere else other than exclusively for your bank accounts.,btohqsg
Not necessarily because e.g dbs does not need singpass or any verification to disburse loan.,btohqsg
no  only clock to uob one account bonus interest  not card rebate,btohqsg
If both phones are on my home WiFi  will that be unsafe?,btohqsg
It’s not about the data connection. It’s that if your main phone gets compromised  the hackers can get your sms OTPs now. Or worse  if someone manages to port your number out to another telco which they have the SIM card. So it’s best to keep a 2nd low profile number that isn’t shared or used anywhere else.,btohqsg
I meant that my safe phone has Singpass and bank apps  another phone has social media and online shopping. The unsafe phone can be compromised but scammers can't access my bank accounts.,btohqsg
Yes that’s probably the safest. Just make sure your safe phone isn’t some ancient out of date Android. Maybe get a spare $5 Simba senior number and shift your bank accounts over as well to completely cut any link between your safe and unsafe phone.,btohqsg
Yes Can. Air BNB uses 4722 or 7011. Both included MCCs for UOB Lady Travel category.,btohqsg
Let's say my main phone gets compromised and this is my SMS OTP number. But my bank apps on the safe phone is not compromised and scammers won't know my login credentials.,btohqsg
Yup they won’t. But having a separate number will also make it easy to tell if someone from the “bank” calls you on your main phone number is 101% a scammer.,btohqsg
I don't pick up calls at all. Thanks for all the advice.,btohqsg

I started using Standard Chartered bonus saver for everyday banking and transactions are taking 48 hours to show on my statement. So slow! I can imagine credit cards tx's are even slower! what other banks are like this in Singapore?,btohqsg
Try using the website  I recall their latest app redesign has a horrid delay.,btohqsg
Whats citibank like for everyday banking. i want to switch already,btohqsg
what kind of transaction? FAST transfer is reflected immediately on sc app/website,btohqsg
Anyone with exp using dbs wwmc with atome and if it is eligible for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
citibank dun really have a good savings account. Need $15000 average daily balance to avoid $15 fall below fee,btohqsg
well last night  i used 7/11 and the transaction isnt even showing today in the app. then the available balance and ledger balance are still different  crazy how slow this is!,btohqsg
using debit card? quite normal for it to show only after it is posted a few days later,btohqsg
so normal for other banks here?,btohqsg
maybe im too used to using Wise. Transactions are instant  and show immediatly,btohqsg
normal for debit card. topup value cards like Wise is different,btohqsg
Heymax is not accurate. I tried charging at Victoria Facelift pte ltd yesterday  the merchant category code show up on amaze app is 7298 not 5999. I wasnt charge 1% fee by amaze.,btohqsg
could be a case of visa mcc vs masters mcc,btohqsg
is MCC5999 eligible for CRMC 4mpd?,btohqsg
So I was Googling FD rates and then scammer send me this message,btohqsg
Why is my phone or scammer actively listening to me or checking my searche. So scary liao,btohqsg
There is usually a data leak somewhere  and leaked to this scammer. One very obvious data leak is by Singpost. Whenever you are expecting a legit delivery from them  a scam email impersonating Singpost will also email you.,btohqsg
Your mobile number exposed in this chat group  later you might get more scam SMS 😂 nice number though,btohqsg
But thats nt his number. Thats the scammer’s one,btohqsg
Thats the number that msg him  still not his,btohqsg
This number auspicious should be belong to Chinese  Chinese ppl like this type of number so I was surprised hahaha,btohqsg
What’s the best place to deposit excess fund of 50k and get best return? I see FD has been dropping quite a bit. Next Tbill think the rate will not be good,btohqsg
I really hope scammer get a lot of stupid calls,btohqsg
Do you have Scamshield installed on your phone to stop scam sms and calls?,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGFYI  i just reconfirmed with webull  activation of moneybull and 2nd round deposit amount need to be fufilled by 30 November 2023 not 16 November 2023. So it is effective a 92 days deposit period till 29 February 2024.,btohqsg
Thanks for verifying. There's a lot of timelines involvedFrom what I read is  deposit to be settled by 16 Nov. Activate and transferred to Moneybull by 30 Nov.,btohqsg
Sure but the money will be deducted immediately,btohqsg
I see. But it will be refunded if when they do release the hold. I wonder if we will know how long the the fund will take?,btohqsg
Wow let me check it out. What’s the tech behind it ? How it knows who is scammer and not for +65 numbers,btohqsg

Noob question on SG T-bills -  upon maturity will the amount be directly transfered back to my DBS account or stay inside my CDP?,btohqsg
Hi I’ve been spending more than $650 per billing cycle on my UOB EVOL card but I don’t seem to be receiving the amount of cashback as I used to ($30-$40). Could it be that my SP utilities is included in the $650 that I’ve spent that’s why I wasn’t eligible for cashback?,btohqsg
Hi all  when does ocbc 360 give their monthly interest?  Thanks :),btohqsg
utilities should be totally excluded  dun count to min spend even,btohqsg
Sp power. Use uob one for 4.3% cashback.,btohqsg
Hi all  just some questions to ask I’m doing DCA every week USD$300 into QQQM but I split it in to half $150 on Monday and $150 on Friday.Should I just one shot buy $300 so that I can save $1.98 or just pay that $1.98 fee ? Because if I continue this for 1 year it cost me $103 😂 just for the fee,btohqsg
Hi Qi An  $300x52 weeks = $15 600. $103 / $15 600 = 0.6%. If QQQ does average return of 5-7% per year (not including dividends if any)  0.6% is not meaningful. Good luck,btohqsg
Soo in short is to buy $300 instate of splitting it in half ?,btohqsg
Ntuc income shield premium counted for uob min spend?,btohqsg
yes for uob one account bonus interest  not card rebate/points,btohqsg
Are we bull and moomoo finance ensured by the government like the banks ?,btohqsg
"Hi all  I have been transferring to my UOB One account via Paynow with a ""SALA"" comment in order to fulfill the salary requirement. It doesn't seem to work this month - anyone faced the same issue?",btohqsg
It does not support apple pay 😅,btohqsg
So need to wait for physical card ?,btohqsg
"not the right way. comments dun count. Try do FAST transfer and select purpose as ""salary payment"" from dropdown list",btohqsg
Hmm I used to do that through OCBC  but there's no longer such purpose under dropdown list,btohqsg
Oh hmm I see salary payment in DBS  I'll try that route. Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi what would u like to know about options,btohqsg
im an options trader myself  just trying to meet like minded people,btohqsg
Is it easy to make consistent pnl with options alone?,btohqsg
thats good. most option traders i know make 4-5 months and 1 month lose back everything,btohqsg
basically most options traders can make money but cant keep the money,btohqsg
well i can  i have been profitable  you?,btohqsg
haha how long have u traded options? I am a futures spread trader  options very little,btohqsg
how old are you? 4 years for me trading options,btohqsg
4 years is not bad  gone through 2020 covid crash and 2022 market correction,btohqsg
haha age doesnt matter. if u want discuss more about options  can join Swim W Options  i am admin there,btohqsg
0.6% is enough to make investors switch ETFs to save on expense cost. 0.6% compounded over 10-20 years will be a huge number. and likely costs will go up over the long run  so in future  this difference may grow to 0.7% or 0.8%,btohqsg
What if 1.2k per month? The fees will be negligible at this point,btohqsg
