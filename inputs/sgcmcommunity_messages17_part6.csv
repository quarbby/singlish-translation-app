yes but my point is ICE very good can still beat tesla,btohqsg
even a45 2.0 turbo can beat truly amazing engine 😍,btohqsg
actly i think the tt can beat plaid,btohqsg
Best ice vs best ev   amount of mod needed and price just to heat,btohqsg
plaid come out like that means like that already  there is no more tuning potential,btohqsg
No need to be faster than tesla... look better  sound better  handle better is more than enough argument,btohqsg
but tesla plaid truly a beast on the straights,btohqsg

It about your belief in an company ba   but to me investing if on long horizon like 5 years no scare 1 la if u got confident in the company,btohqsg
Tesla must drop more for value investing... not much meat currently unless u think it can go 1500,btohqsg
I believe is can hit 2000  that why I keep accumulate and wait for 5 years hit or not is another thing,btohqsg
It did lose more than 6% over the last 5 days... but don't worry I also believe in this share.,btohqsg
Anyone know which workshop to check hybrid batter  replace or repair ?,btohqsg
6 percent is nothing... 50 percent still fight on😂,btohqsg
imagine those who bought at 12xx Tesla n drop to 6xx,btohqsg
don't worry... not going to draw any conclusion about the car itself from this because that would be short sighted of me.,btohqsg
Common in stock   that why only use a potrtion of your saving go invest   take it as the money not there,btohqsg
Last time I put a huge portion of saving in stock   every night can’t sleep 1,btohqsg
not necessary 2 years  most batteries are warranted for 5years nowadays.... If your mechanics ask you to replace battery  ask them. About the crank cycle condition of your current battery... Most won't tell you  or they don't even know what is that... Haha...my personal experience. A service supervisor at a renowned organisation for car dealership's workshop told me that I need to replace my battery and it will cost me about $500+. I asked about the current cranking cycle condition and he cannot answer me. I told him I have already checked my current battery before going in for service.,btohqsg
Is there a link to read up on this? I tried googling but could not find a relevant link,btohqsg
Where can buy 5 year warranty battery ah i wanna buy also,btohqsg
