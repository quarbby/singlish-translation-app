The Public Utilities Board (PUB) of Singapore has initiated several significant projects with estimated costs around S$2 billion:Changi Water Reclamation Plant (WRP) Expansion: In June 2024  PUB announced the third phase of expansion for the Changi WRP. The project includes constructing new facilities such as an additional influent pumping station  liquid treatment modules  and a biosolids treatment facility. The full construction is estimated to cost about S$2 billion.Tuas Water Reclamation Plant (Tuas WRP): As part of the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS) Phase 2  PUB is developing the Tuas WRP with an estimated cost exceeding S$2 billion. The construction is divided into multiple tender packages  with about 11 construction tenders expected over five years. The plant aims to be the largest membrane bioreactor facility globally  contributing significantly to Singapore's used water management strategy.Tuas Nexus Integration: PUB  in collaboration with the National Environment Agency (NEA)  is developing the Tuas Nexus—a facility integrating used water and solid waste treatment processes. The total estimated value of tenders for this project is over S$5 billion  with PUB's portion  including the Tuas WRP  accounting for over S$2 billion. This initiative marks Singapore's first attempt to harness the synergies of the water-energy-waste nexus by integrating used water and solid waste treatment processes.These projects are part of PUB's ongoing efforts to enhance Singapore's water infrastructure and ensure long-term sustainability.,btohqsg
