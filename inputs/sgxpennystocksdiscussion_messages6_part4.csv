do you mind explain what does married deal means?,btohqsg
Actually I'm very curious as to why people say Taiwan MT and SG MT should have no connection.I understand that its different market.But the Taiwan ADR entitles the holder to the same underlying shares  dividends  participation/voting rights as any share in SG within the same legal entity with the same prospects for growth  capital appreciation and any bonus issuance.Just genuinely curious as to the justifications for people continually saying that. :),btohqsg
My Ep for STA is 1.4,btohqsg
Still got a long way to ChIONG,btohqsg
Where got Zhun?Holding heavy bag now,btohqsg
But this one I trust if not I SL le,btohqsg
Your heavy is so light compared to mine ok?,btohqsg
The shares rank pari pasu. But the market valuing the stocks have different fair value.This is the disconnection that I think we are talking about here. Not whether the underlying shares share the same characteristicsU have to understand  2 valuer value the same thing can be at a vastly different price,btohqsg
