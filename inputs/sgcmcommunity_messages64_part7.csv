u guys are really freaking legends,btohqsg
Questioning my existence and the meaning of life,btohqsg
Exactly. It’s not about the 0-100 itself. Anyway it’s the sound  feel and experience in getting there that truly matters.,btohqsg

need buy the dragy kit and use the app  not actually drag race but i’ll instead tune ur acceleration,btohqsg

If the aim is to compare how fast a car is  100-200 is legitimately a better benchmark.Fast is relative and subjective though,btohqsg
Wow sound fun time for vtec to kick in,btohqsg
It will be in English. But specs wise  certain things are left out in PI,btohqsg
