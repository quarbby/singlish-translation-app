Not a good ‚ò¢Ô∏èDon't hold abandoned babyI cut all one timeI'm be back again üò≠,btohqsg
This week alone Wong came out to sell at least 50 000lots (minimum)-5 x 10 000 lots sell all should be his-Which brings his estimated total holdings to approx. 30k to 100k lots now.It might even be lesser since there were other smaller lots selling and at least 40 000 lots done at $0.005  he might have been in the early Q too.,btohqsg
As of 10 Dec 2020   Wong Ben Koon had 622mil shares and as of yesterday he have 30-100 mil left. Who bought his Main chunk of 522mil shares ?,btohqsg
Out of Rex yesterday morning  made a bit.,btohqsg
http://www.hso.com.sg/about-us/the-board/Anyways  just saw that HSO website have been updated.Also   I noted that in the past 2 years  3 board directors nominated are all Bruneians / working in Bruinei.This bode wells. Ultimately we do not know who Lee Han Peng sides with.The HK or Bruneian Prince Qawi (non- executive chairman)Previously the entire board was from HK since HK Wong Ben Koon took over and put her daughter as CEO.,btohqsg
Lee Han Peng might be the saving graceI believe the reason that they can put 3 Bruneians into the board is good indication that he might be on Prince side. Maybe his proxy.,btohqsg
The best case is the chips are bought up by1) Brunei Prince proxies- judging from the fact that there were 0 Bruneians on board with prince since he came on board in 30Sept2014 til 30Mar 2020 (Bruneian Vivien Goo came to board)(during this period a Lee Han peng came up and bought up shares and is the single biggest shareholder with about 13%)2) BBs and they are waiting to see whether Wong is done before frying it,btohqsg
Back in 2014  when Bruneian prince bought shares of HSO at $0.020( formerly KLW holdings) and joined as Chairman  coincidentally the first acquisition was an Australian related property. At that point  you can tell there were plenty of plans for the company  which have kind of died down over the years.This year  a loan deal with % was finalised to another Australian co.It‚Äôs seems like the spark is back. Also  previously controlling SSH Wong Ben Koon have reduced most of his shares in this period along with 3 new board members (bruneians/working in Brunei) joining the board too.For me  it is not a coincidence. The best thing that can happen is a board fight and the Bruneians ousting underperforming CEO Hk Gloria out. Her father Wong no longer has Chips to fight such a motion.My take is the Bruneians will take over the board and have complete control  just a matter of time. If so  this should be good for us minorities.üôèüèª good luck to us holders. $0.004 is an easy buy for those who can hold,btohqsg
Some background on HSO Chairman   Bruneian Prince Abdul Qawi who holds 500 000 000 bought in 2013 at $0.020(Current price of $0.004 is 20% of prince price),btohqsg
Current biggest single controlling SSH in HSO is Lee Han Peng  his identity is unknown and we do not know whether he sides with Brunei Prince or the HK managementIf he is on Prince side  then we will soon see an end to the HK management reign.For me  I believe he should be Brunei prince proxy. But still  this is only speculation and do not take my word for it. It is just how I read it.Anyways  seems like interesting times for HSO because Wong Ben Koon no longer has control so why do we need Gloria Wong as CEO? They overpay themselves and yet don‚Äôt seem to deliver the results.#timeforchange,btohqsg
Based on my above research  I believe $0.004 is an extremely safe buy as long as you can hold. It is practically risk free and the risk-reward here is great üëç since we are buying the bottom.NAV : $0.012.Safest micro pennies around based on FA / Assets.Consider this an early Xmas present as I believe this has double / multi bag potential.Signing out.DYODD too.,btohqsg

Back in july2019.P5 controlling shareholder Lim Shao-Lin bought in $10million total worth of shares  $0.063.Credit:https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/p5-capital-substantial-shareholders-to-sell-stakes-for-s10m-shares-jump-909%3famp,btohqsg
So who is Aviers Lim Shao-Lin and why he threw $10mil sgd to get controlling stake in p5 capital back in 2019 at $0.063?Based on some research  can tell his plan is to do an RTO of his private entity GASHUB (LNG and clean renewable related business) - he should be the sole shareholder of GasHub - *to correct me if I am wrong*Earlier this year  there was the first business tie up between P5 Capital and GASHUB when $500 000 investment deal was ironed for one of GasHub projects.What I like about this Potential RTO is that  GasHub is in exactly the right business segment that I believe might be next big play up after medicals.- Clean/Green Renewable energy.It might not be so soon but there will be more attention into this space in future.Note: I believe initially they planned to do an RTO in ASX but have since chosen SGX and p5 capital as the vehicle to do so.This one ‚òùÔ∏è is one to watch out for the future.
