If he did his old messages wonâ€™t be deleted,btohqsg
Hmm hes banned for some reason which idk,btohqsg
Yeah I'm checking with the mod team why they banned him,btohqsg
If you get sentenced to more than 6 years in prison in Singapore and it's a major crime not petty crime. You will never leave the prison system. Drugs are considered petty crimes within the prison system.Because every 6 years you will be evaluated on your behaviour. If you see still deemed a danger which abusers/killers/deviants all will always be deemed. You will never be let out of the prison system.This policy applied in countries like Norway and Switzerland is what gives these countries the title of safest countries in the world.More often than not it's not about the severity of punishments but rather the frequency of retention and release in the prison system.,btohqsg
Sorry I'm asked to keep him removed,btohqsg
Is the reason why he is banned related to YT and rand,btohqsg
I actually dk this whole rand saga,btohqsg
At least we know all 3 of them getting banned wasnâ€™t intentional,btohqsg
I'm not at liberty to share the details,btohqsg

Bro is about to bring sg currency down,btohqsg
That is what happened to japan,btohqsg
inflation will happen like crazy at this rate,btohqsg
I bread cost 20 million marks,btohqsg
if inflation goes so steep its upright,btohqsg
I'm no politician but I got better sokution,btohqsg

Nah bro that's weak  I grew up seeing these,btohqsg
This is a bus of japan,btohqsg
Any uni peeps can help me,btohqsg
Will a D in 1 4mc mod and a C in 1 4mc mod pull down my cap by > 0.18,btohqsg
Prof be like gossiping to each other coz they saw me really behind time,btohqsg
I freaking saw it w my peripheral vision,btohqsg
Im just praying at this rate coz i did decently for the other 60% of this module,btohqsg
It was 4qns lah  i did 18 qns tho i did not know what i was writing in the 1st 2 qns,btohqsg
LOL so u did 16 qn,btohqsg
Bell curve will not work in my favour coz wth mean was 72% for one of the earlier exams,btohqsg
Will this be my first D,btohqsg
but maybe can just throw into gpa cap calculator,btohqsg
Tbh i totally predicted i m not gonna finish the paper,btohqsg
If im gonna get a D for this  i need to pray my econs and coding is at least B+,btohqsg
Then at least got higher hope,btohqsg
And also pray that my other 60% is well enough,btohqsg
This one is 4k  how to suðŸ’€,btohqsg
I think my other 60% is ard 65-69%,btohqsg
Actually how does the left side of the bell curve works,btohqsg
It only controls the right side right,btohqsg
I calculated i need 21/40 for this exam to get 60%,btohqsg
But question is will B- be a 60%,btohqsg
And another question is will i pass,btohqsg
yeah i dont think the bell curve tampers with the low scores from the left side of the bell curve because its not necessary? idk,btohqsg
i dont know about nus but in ntu i think 60% is a B-,btohqsg
not that there is a hard and fast rule about what marks get what grades but,btohqsg
it sometimes does  i got promoted by the bell curve cuz the whole cohort did jialat for physics,btohqsg
i have never ever heard MI using a bell curve,btohqsg
According to my dadâ€™s prediction that 23m = 4qns  22qns 120m (coz i did not count total marks)  i can afford 63/120,btohqsg
back in my day fail means fail  even if you get 44/100  you can still kenna retained,btohqsg
i came into MI at a wrong time xD,btohqsg
a lot of my friends had to retain because of her,btohqsg
one of my friend kenna kick out of school because of her,btohqsg
LOL i hope hes doing okay,btohqsg
he got 43/100 for his chem  and only passed another h2,btohqsg
If it is 100m â€”> 52.5/100-23m i just gutterI can afford to lose another 30m,btohqsg
i got 41 for physics and passed 1h2chance given,btohqsg
bell curve here bell curve thr a level bell curve not so easy,btohqsg
Am i lestin / wyatt / siyan,btohqsg
i mean that is better  but she couldve looked the other way for certain close cases but ya,btohqsg
honestly how did the cohort do so badly,btohqsg
Im hungry but my dad takes ages in the toilet,btohqsg
which is to say its not very original and quite routine questions,btohqsg
so u go toilet to search for food,btohqsg
if standard dropping and people cant even solve routine A level exam qns,btohqsg
no principal joined only this year,btohqsg
only mdm khoo is saving our butts,btohqsg
okay la maybe there's more to the story,btohqsg
yala i saw u during institute day,btohqsg
maybe standard quality of teachers dropped too,btohqsg
oh its just my phys yeacher,btohqsg
oh my y4 math cher was called mdm khoo,btohqsg
I did not finish the paper alive,btohqsg
What's your total for cGPA computation,btohqsg
i dont think the MI notes wouldve changed much since i left,btohqsg
so i kinda know how the notes are,btohqsg
i dont suppose they are that bad bah,btohqsg
damn we disagree on opposite ends,btohqsg
i think their gp notes are shit,btohqsg
and i swear its just MI that doesnt appreciate my writing style,btohqsg
they will not use the whole range one,btohqsg
they can give me a U for prelims but i go a levels i get an A  and i did not change a single thing about my writing style,btohqsg
okay ppr 2 is just cancerous all year round tbh,btohqsg
year 1 - 3 i've never done well for ppr 2,btohqsg
ya la gp not part of promo criteria,btohqsg
thats kinda the sad mindset of MI students,btohqsg
but i was in those shoes so understandable,btohqsg
i was last batch before gp implemented into promo criteria,btohqsg
thats asking for retention rate to skyrocket,btohqsg
no but the new criteria is like ESSS,btohqsg
I need to be above 3 to graduate w honours,btohqsg
What is needed to not decrease my cGPA by > 0.18,btohqsg
Waaa errr yeah it will fuck it up for a C and D,btohqsg
Especially if its a 4k mod,btohqsg
I would have retained y2 with the new criteria,btohqsg
I tot only the number of mc,btohqsg
Yala 4AU instead of normal 3 lor,btohqsg
i dont think NUS students do 3AU mods,btohqsg
I calculated if i get 65% avg for the other 60% of the module  i need a 21/40 computed to whatever marks the paper carry to get 60% overall,btohqsg
their mods usually 4AUs one or 4MCs,btohqsg
Walao half my time is just doing maths to see how efficiently I can fit 4AU and 3AU mods into my 12AU SU quota,btohqsg
y1 need to pass all 3h2???,btohqsg
only guy I â€˜knowâ€™ from MI is prob in poly or some shit I assume,btohqsg
If i get B+ for econs and B for coding,btohqsg
Maybe it will do my cCAP good,btohqsg
it has always been 2h2 passes only for my time,btohqsg
Anyway the results gonna be out on 3rd june,btohqsg
What is the chances of failing this mod,btohqsg
why do people go to mi,btohqsg
what is the mean and variance,btohqsg
because ijc didnt offer me double science,btohqsg
because my ass took combined science,btohqsg
there probably was an alternate universe where I went there,btohqsg
thank god Iâ€™m in this dimension,btohqsg
i mean MI is really not a terrible school in all honesty,btohqsg
i dont find much of anything to complain about,btohqsg
If its a C+ and D+ probably can scrap by assuming the rest is A- or B+,btohqsg
I thought mi was the ite of jcs,btohqsg
The C range is 2.5 and the D range is 2 right,btohqsg
C+ is 2.5 and D+ is 1.5?,btohqsg
Neh i dun think i can get A-,btohqsg
Its literally in the name it was the old CI thing,btohqsg
Wait i tot D is 2,btohqsg
my old math teacher : the only difference between you guys and RI is only one letter,btohqsg
is it NUS using different gpa scoring whatdafag,btohqsg
NTU is 3 letters and there are 3 different NTUs all universities and are quite decent for all,btohqsg
no longer in MI already  he was called Tan Kwok Wai,btohqsg
D is 1  D+ is 1.5,btohqsg
or maybe he retire already  cant seem to find any updates on him,btohqsg
i remember there is a tan something when i joined year 1  and he looks quite old,btohqsg
Ok la my other stuff is 39/60,btohqsg
Can be this paper i score <11/40,btohqsg
As long as your average is C+ to B- then u can stay,btohqsg
Cant let this sem drop cap by < 0.18,btohqsg
Yala that one should be 3,btohqsg
C+ can keep above 3 meh,btohqsg
What is the grade of C+ C and C- ah,btohqsg
The 0.18 should be able to tank that assuming u didn't overload this sem,btohqsg
I hope my other 60% of the module did sufficiently ok to keep be 60% overall (if i surprisingly pass my paper tdy),btohqsg
Yea i take 5mc this sem,btohqsg
If i can get abuv that for some mod  will it still be able to tank a C/C-,btohqsg
I gotta get a A- average for me if not my GPA will tank,btohqsg
words i will never ever speak,btohqsg
I need to maintain a B average if not my GPA will tank...,btohqsg
I wish A+ would grant like offsets..,btohqsg
I hear SMU does that rite?,btohqsg
laufeys new album is growing on me lol,btohqsg
they left me alone in the brainrot,btohqsg
u become 1 man show for brainrot,btohqsg
not that i'm here often nowadays anyway,btohqsg
4.3/4.0 for A+ or for us 5.5/5 for A+,btohqsg
Offset any B- you have to a B,btohqsg
Basically u get rewarded for focusing and doing very well on a module,btohqsg
No but for SMU A+ is 4.3/4.0,btohqsg
Ya la for SMU that's how it works for A+,btohqsg
hovering dangerously between the fine line of third class and 2nd lower,btohqsg
I mean what will it end up,btohqsg
if he needs an A- average it means he's FCH now,btohqsg
It is ok coz i think mine is lower than yours,btohqsg
Fucking hovering at 0.05 away that kind,btohqsg
damn 0.05 aint a lot to spare,btohqsg
Got a B average for ICC,btohqsg
wait thats actually impressive in a bad way,btohqsg
average i've heard about ICCs are like B+s,btohqsg
Im hovering dangerously between pass and honours,btohqsg
as the core mods get harder my gpa probably will tank too,btohqsg
Yeah it is it's cuz 1 I got B-,btohqsg
i think the law of large numbers will dictate most people to get B+,btohqsg
Idk bruh this sem is 3 and 5,btohqsg
3 and 5 are the easiest ones to get B+ and higher tho,btohqsg
The 2 vs 3 AUs makes calculation fucked up,btohqsg
I fucked up the quiz for 3,btohqsg
tbvvvh without ICC my gpa finna be 2.0,btohqsg
depends how you define fucked up,btohqsg
Ah so u are the one who ICC office says on average it raises ppl gpa,btohqsg
I tot ur gpa is between 2nd lower and 3rd,btohqsg
Where did 2 suddenly come in,btohqsg
i guess the idea is that ICC isn't hard to score decently in,btohqsg
60% is good enough for B+,btohqsg
so if you struggle with core mods  it'll pull you up,btohqsg
i got 60% for my cc3 mcq too  end grade B+,btohqsg
I hv never reached A- and above,btohqsg
Poster not very good  group panel B+,btohqsg
Haha what the heck are core mods,btohqsg
Dk the average for this quiz last year it was shit I think that's why.,btohqsg
"i just defined anything that's within your major as ""core"" mods",btohqsg
so for physics i'm thinking math and physics,btohqsg
said core mods are killing me now,btohqsg
InterdisciplinaryI can claim MPEs outside my major,btohqsg
Do u care that I care?,btohqsg
pls god let me get B- for my math finals tmr and let me go,btohqsg
ntu as a whole is direct honours,btohqsg
I need to maintain for my course plan to work,btohqsg
Can just get below 3.9 and don't do FYP,btohqsg
Legit that's a fucking strategy for my course,btohqsg
is FYP as a whole very taxing,btohqsg
ever since i realised i might need to pull up my gpa i've been considering doing FYP now LOL,btohqsg
tbh it depends on your prof,btohqsg
if you still feel like doing it in after y3  lmk and i'll give suggestions,btohqsg
my fyp prof was p good,btohqsg
im giving myself until past y3s1 to decide,btohqsg
i met him a total of 3 times through the year LOL,btohqsg
but yeah i'll let you know,btohqsg
Did u do URECA I wanna do FYP-URECA but idk if it's worth,btohqsg
Maybe just take the L and then get 4AUs in BDEs,btohqsg
Convenient in that I get to start in Y2,btohqsg
But kinda stressful cuz it adds on course load,btohqsg
If FYP-URECA is just copy paste and add a bit more on your URECA existing project then might be worth,btohqsg
personal thought is that URECA is for people that wanna do research in the future or test the waters to see if it's for them,btohqsg
Oh are u in the alumni association along w irwen,btohqsg
Wait u can not do fyp?,btohqsg
If u and irwen were there on I day,btohqsg
I would ditch irwen to meet u,btohqsg
they only want me for my slavery in SPMS club,btohqsg
Yep only if u are below 3.9 then u can choose not to do FYP,btohqsg
idk i dont have any girls so dates arent my thing,btohqsg
Isit like smth u can just built on. Like use your existing essay and extend it,btohqsg
Gotta overload so I get to join yall for graduation,btohqsg
for course load reasons i'd rather just skip URECA and do FYP on its own,btohqsg
Merit and pass only cuz 3.9,btohqsg
nah u r married to the russian dude,btohqsg
3.5-3.99 is honours merit3-3.49 is honours,btohqsg
then musician must aim for first class honours,btohqsg
U get the honors just Merit and Pass basically,btohqsg
if i could graduate with merit i would die happy,btohqsg
Maybe I should do that purposely tank and just don't do FYP,btohqsg
But need to do 2 more 4k mods which imo is soo worth,btohqsg
I like me some mashed potatoes,btohqsg
up to you bc FYP for you works differently from me so can't advise as well as i'd like,btohqsg
the cable holding for dear life fr  need to buy replacement,btohqsg
"i tried using this ""solder paste"" for the yellow one",btohqsg
Did u inhale the smoke like any distinguished gentleman should?,btohqsg
Btw what app ppl normally use for notetaking on pld,btohqsg
what was ms su like while she was ur pe cher,btohqsg
i think i used easy notes,btohqsg
I gave up halfway and was like im just hoping for honours and i will be halpy,btohqsg
Like any other teacher js be nice and listen to her,btohqsg
What are yall doing for PE,btohqsg
I think TM pe dept in gen is chill,btohqsg
Literally just don't piss em off and U be fine,btohqsg
Prolly just choose wtv sports or smth,btohqsg
i thought it was just a one-off thing,btohqsg
So sad. Cb your batch pissing everyone off,btohqsg
Ok la at least not the whole class lor,btohqsg
I alrd find some wholesome juniors,btohqsg
I consider can be friends ah,btohqsg
Not mr Yusof (but i think he left alr),btohqsg
Say j1 this year feel like they own the school,btohqsg
Eh I get what they mean,btohqsg
I see their attitude in the confession page alrd,btohqsg
The cher who releases the class 30min into refess,btohqsg
Why is the confession page always soðŸ’€,btohqsg
Like ik it's damn generalising plus that shits a cesspool but still,btohqsg
Once the current j1s comes in then,btohqsg
And we had to tahan the shit,btohqsg
No i followed the prev confession pg which got forced to shut down,btohqsg
Soz for the shit my batch do lol,btohqsg
It's a tradition for j2s to hate j1s atp,btohqsg
My confession page got no inter-batch fight,btohqsg
I hope for current j2s to finally like see,btohqsg
I heard what the j2 call j1 mugger,btohqsg
But makers j1s R still ok,btohqsg
And how they behaved last year,btohqsg
And said they wun be able to survive,btohqsg
Tbh idrc what others do lah,btohqsg
"occasionally will see the ""see j2s this is how us j3s felt"" then immediately will have ""why some j3 bozo following this acc go away lah""",btohqsg
I srly mugging more during breaks alrd,btohqsg
Graphing techniques only cb want to mug,btohqsg
I dun really care if anyone wanrs call me mugger,btohqsg
Coz they are not the ones responsible for my grades,btohqsg
But like I do mug la,btohqsg
The opportunity cost is high if i give in to such pressure,btohqsg
My class got a bunch of toxic people,btohqsg
if uw mug ok lah but surely even muggers have interests outside of mugging,btohqsg
Tbh i dun really study in sch  i prefer to study at home,btohqsg
most of them aren't mugging to,btohqsg
how did it feel seeing the responses,btohqsg
Xavier  val  orange  me  you  person starting w j but i forgot his name,btohqsg
tbh i study better outside of sch,btohqsg
Same actuallyâ€¦i cant concentrate in sch env,btohqsg
I'm somewhat ok w the right ppl,btohqsg
I just put on my headphones,btohqsg
But I can study at noisy cafes also and not care so like....,btohqsg
At home is possible but less productive I feel,btohqsg
Just gimme any cold drink and I'll be fine alrd,btohqsg
Realâ€¦anything cold will wake me up,btohqsg
idk what cups the good news cafe uses,btohqsg
but when i drink from the opening i feel like will have abit of drink spill out,btohqsg
bc of that once i split iced coffee on my cygnus shirt,btohqsg
But meh I got too many alrd,btohqsg
Alm all my shirts got coffee stains say real ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg

My class was just ppl throw ideas we do voting gaodim damn fast cuz we just wanna get it over n done w,btohqsg
Wtf y'all doing PW or what,btohqsg
after we randomly scribble smth the class got damn noisy until i was so sure we were gonna get an ass whooping once the teachers got back,btohqsg
just as well they didn't care,btohqsg
but they were also pulling students out of class,btohqsg
Every term Ur ct will talk to u,btohqsg
To try to know how U doing n shit,btohqsg
U can trauma dump if uw LMAO,btohqsg
LOL I TOLD MY CHEM CHER ABOUT DABOI,btohqsg
ok actl i think the actual reason in this case is abit more personal regarding a certain classmate,btohqsg
then again he was absent for like one entire week and tdy he was absent again,btohqsg
But idw complain to him about door girl,btohqsg
My convo became mostly me flaming my class cuz I can't study in the environment,btohqsg
And some other more personal stuff la,btohqsg
my sec sch cca had someone who didn't attend cca for all 4 years,btohqsg
I told my teacher about boy lore and the ct say he lack self awareness,btohqsg
I couldn't care less for most of them,btohqsg
"""oh he's my daddy"" ""oh iw suck his cock""",btohqsg

speaking about gd news cafe i miss it sia,btohqsg
from my trusted news source welovetmjc2,btohqsg
everytime say hire teachers but teachers also cannot teach properly,btohqsg
might as well use the money to make better notes,btohqsg
Js that I miss the iced coffee there,btohqsg
is it normal for the freshly printed notes from the printing shop to almost burn your fingers,btohqsg
Almost burn is a slight exaggeration,btohqsg
jus say u watching A divs match,btohqsg
I can alr predict who is the sc pres for my batch,btohqsg
or just wear ur tmjc tshirt,btohqsg
What if my ez link doesn't work,btohqsg
