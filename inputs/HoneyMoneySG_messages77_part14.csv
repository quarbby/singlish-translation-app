To over simplify  XNAP is the payment service provider while Google Pay (not to be confused with GPay app) is the mobile wallet service.Instead of you providing your details (again) to XNAP  you can use Google Pay  which you may probably have used for other online payments like Shopee or Foodpanda.,btohqsg
Yes but that’s base interest usually $4. So negligible.,btohqsg

Recently received my passion posb debit card with the yuu/SimplyGo function..my curiosity is does it have any cash rebate reward just for using simplygo? I’m not a fan of simplygo just yet. And how do I deactivate simplygo function for passion posb  if I want to apply a new credit card like StandChart smart credit card for simplygo,btohqsg
Just tap your SCB Smart Credit Card instead of your POSB Passion Debit Card when boarding bus/train...,btohqsg
cards are automatically enrolled for simplygo so there's no need to activate/deactivate anything if you want to use a different card,btohqsg
Does that mean that if I accidentally withdraw this $4 (since it is not being earmarked)  I become ineligible for the promo even if the incremental amount has been earmarked?,btohqsg
I would quickly put back the amount and $10 more to “make up” for it. To be safe.As said. I’m conservative and kiasi.,btohqsg
Thanks  another question is  do u know if there’s any rebate/rewards if I use passion posb debit card just for simplygo?,btohqsg

Btw. Uob one bonus interested credited late night 2nd dec Saturday.,btohqsg
They credited me wrongly ah? I got 6k inside they only give me $18..wtf,btohqsg
I’m at lvl 2 also..isn’t it 3.85%?,btohqsg
???6000*0.0385 = 231231 / 365 * 30 = 18.986Sounds correct ah...?,btohqsg
I registered for it. App doesn’t show if it’s earmarked or not,btohqsg
Oh ya shit..math is not my strong suit hahaha,btohqsg
Uob one card also can right?,btohqsg
U registered UOB NDP n still not yet earmarked?,btohqsg

is Trust card useful and worth it?,btohqsg
what is ur context and use case?,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn  yes I do read the website and found out CIMB better 3.5% compare to 3% 😂,btohqsg
I used Trust debit card to buy from Australian online store and I am happy with the FX conversion. No charges by Trust. Thanks to Queenie for her advice to use Trust card.,btohqsg
what else do you think it is useful for Trust Card,btohqsg
i think maybe u tell us the use case  then its easily for us to tell u useful a not,btohqsg
I have no idea what Trust card is used for.,btohqsg
then maybe no point getting it,btohqsg
may be more useful to look up a review of the card and see if the perks fit your spending,btohqsg
You should think of what you are spending on then find the best card catered to your spending instead,btohqsg
Thematics are subjected to beta risks which defeats the purpose of dca which is to capture the overall market returns.So dca on thematics is a fundamentally futile exercise whereby dca is meant be a passive investing style to capture the market return.Thematics or single security is meant to be active style of investing whereby entry n exit strategies coupled with analysis are involved.So to say doing dca on thematics is a wrong concept fundamentally on what dca is meant to achieve.,btohqsg
Mainly to withdraw cash overseas at good rates compared to money changers.,btohqsg
how about using it for overseas spending like Wise/Youtrip? Wise has at least 0.4% fees where Trust says 0%  but not sure which exchange rate is better,btohqsg
No need to guess. This is the 3rd time I participated in the save compaigns in this year. Each time 1 account.,btohqsg
i mainly use youtrip n trust  these are the 2 overseas use card i have.i am not sure with rest of the platform  but i am happy with this 2 for now,btohqsg
I didn't say DCA on thematics hahaha. I said DCA on TLT ETF. Asset allocation using ETFs  switching among ETFs that track stocks  bonds  REIT  countries  sectors.,btohqsg
trust: visa currency converter with 0% bank feeyoutrip: inapp rates for supported currencies otherwise MC currency converter with 0% bank feewise: internal rates  check by performing a currency conversion in-appyou may opt to verify the rate in each app before picking where to charge  but generally it won't be a significant difference unless you're spending a lot,btohqsg
The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF seeks to track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. Treasury bonds with remaining maturities greater than twenty years.It is considered thematic because it’s on a single asset class US treasury > 20 years maturity.,btohqsg
the one main differentiator is that unlike wise/youtrip  trust is an actual bank account and not subject to ewallet restrictions on transfers spend limits etc,btohqsg
Any one can share experience switching to wifi6 routers.. really good upgrade?,btohqsg
can trust remit money to overseas bank account too? wise can do,btohqsg
Does top up of Grab Wallet for UOB One Account considered as $500 spending?,btohqsg
nobasically any transaction (except for insurance) excluded by UOB credit card TnCs will not qualify for the $500 spend,btohqsg
I like that it is probably the only card with the card number not shown on it. Some places still have to handover card to cashier for payment.,btohqsg
there are 2 things  - 1 is the qualifying spend for the uob cash rebates and another is for the uob one account interest. i think the uob one account interest spending are less restrictive.,btohqsg
MCC exclusions are identical except for insurance,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSGwhat app you use to keep track of your credit card spend ? My cc spend is $1500 average monthly. Wanted to move the 500$ spend to maybank platinum visa.,btohqsg
Passive investors look to replicate a given index or market. Not to be confused with DCA. DCA is not meant to just capture market return  rather it is to avoid market timing  be it for single stocks or single asset classes. This is why online brokers offer DCA on single stocks. So DCA is simply to do away with timing the market. S&P500 is passive investing to achieve market return with beta=1  but DCA is not necessarily passive investing. It can be used for single stocks and asset classes  essentially active investing.,btohqsg
