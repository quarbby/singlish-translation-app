Posted on Behalf of CHATHello everyone! We are a group of CHAT ambassadors (under IMH) trying to understand more about the mental health beliefs  barriers  and facilitators that youths in Singapore face when trying to seek mental health support. The information collected from this ~10 mins survey would then help us in improving the accessibility of mental health to youths in Singapore like yourself.We are looking for youths from 16 to 20 years old to help us in this survey.We will be extremely grateful if you could kindly spare 10 minutes of your time to answer some questions. You would be asked questions about your personal mental health beliefs  and factors that discourage and encourages you to seek mental health support and suggestions for improvement.Your participation in this survey is completely voluntary and you have the right to withdraw from the survey at any time. Do also be rest assured that your information will be kept confidential and any personal information will be discarded after the research has been completed.Thank you and we really appreciate your help in this! ^^Link to survey:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3MmkYYNF9nh7jXkUcHHSs24diiYCFLH0HpYb7zw-wvG1hbQ/viewform,btohqsg

how to finish a paper ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Basically u start with the questions with the most marks,btohqsg
"Hey everyone  I took A levels last year and would like to share my tips in studying for H2 Geography :) I understand that everybody studies differently and what I find useful may not be so for you  so if you would like to share your own tips and advice in studying for the subject  feel free to add on in this thread!I'll be splitting this post into 2 segments: Exam Strategy and Studying Tips. Under Exam Strategy I would address how to tackle the Essay and DRQ components separately  as well as some things I suggest doing under certain scenarios. Under Studying Tips I would address (as the name suggests) how to plan your study schedule when preparing for your exams. I won't be able to provide help for specific content mastery though  since I haven't touched my lecture notes since end-November last year (oops)EXAM STRATEGYEssaysAlways go for quality over quantity. Your essays are meant to showcase your ability to think like a geographer: how you employ synoptic links  how you critically analyse and present your case  as well as your familiarity with content (which ties in with your use of synoptic links). As such  I would suggest going for  for instance  4 astutely argued body paragraphs rather than 6 mediocre ones.Write a good conclusion. This goes without saying  but I think conclusions play a very significant role in the Geography essays  to the point where  in a scenario whereby you only have 5 minutes left and are halfway through your last content paragraph  I would suggest forgoing your content paragraph and write your conclusion instead. If the question calls for it  and if you are able to do so under timed constraints  you can opt for writing more than 1 conclusion paragraph.But what is a good conclusion  and how do you write one? A good conclusion is one that allows you to demonstrate critical thinking and the ability to comfortably adopt multiple perspectives. Meaning to say  it should try to achieve balance with the topic  and this can be done through dissecting underlying factors and pre-causes of the problem presented in an essay. This is also a great opportunity to make synoptic links. There is no one templatised way to churn out a 'model conclusion'; it really depends on the question and your own way of adding insights to the topic.By ""adding insights""  I don't mean introducing new content which should have been in the body paragraph. Conclusions are meant to synthesize and balance  instead of elaboration on a new point.What on earth is a synoptic link  and how do I make it? As we all know  content for H2 Geography is split into 3 Themes  and tested separately in the Essay paper. Synoptic links happen when you employ concepts from another theme to elaborate on your answer. I would suggest going beyond namedropping concepts [e.g. namedropping the ITCZ (theme 1) in explaining water scarcity (theme 2) in BWh/Aw areas] and doing a bit more elaboration for 1-2 lines and briefly explain the subtropical high pressure belt can result in low rainfall and hence arid climates.Prepare your case studies  and use them well. It's okay to use a ""textbook"" example in Geog  since what the examiners want to see is the quality of the argument and how you use the example to elucidate your argument. What matters the most is how well you know your example  and by that I don't mean you need to memorise specific statistics  but how it fits your argument contextually. So folks plspls go and familiarise yourselves with case materials for dat [insert your desired grade]For most of us who read GP  we learn that the bulk of your explanation should come from your elaboration  and examples are used as a means to validate your explanation. Personally  some of my peers and juniors may face some issues for Geog as a result  since for Geog things aren't quite the same.",btohqsg
I believe that GP goes about testing how well you can argue  whereas Geog examiners would prefer seeing how you use your evidence to support your claim because they aren't testing you on how to argue  but more of what conclusion/inference you can derive from presented evidence. Ultimately  Geog is a social science  meaning that conclusions are derived from observing trends  which can only come from present evidence.,btohqsg
"Data-Response Questions (DRQ)For questions with lower order command words (e.g. ""describe"")  go for quantity over length. These questions don't require elaboration  so I would suggest directly describing it and leave more time for the higher order command words (e.g. ""explain"" ""comment"" ""account for"" ""recommend"" ""evaluate"")It may sometimes be hard to see what examiners want from these questions. Don't overthink; just pen down what you see  the answers can be super obvious sometimes [e.g. I remember seeing one DRQ question which asks you to describe the spatial distribution of the ""Hot Banana"" zone in western Europe  and one of the answers that carries a mark is literally ""it is shaped like a banana"". So don't think too hard.]Know your mark breakdown. How many marks each point carries  as well as how much elaboration should go with it  can be extremely helpful. [The following are general rules of thumb  examiners from Cambridge or your school can set questions that throw you off guard that may not be aligned with what is mentioned here  so exercise your own discretion and caution] There are some instances in which a 7 mark question is marked by points (i.e. the number of valid points determines how many marks you get)  and sometimes a 6 mark question can be marked by levels (i.e. the quality of your argument determines how many marks you get). To determine if that is the case  look at your command words: if it starts with ""explain/comment/account for"" etc  it's probably marked by points  and if it starts with ""evaluate/recommend"" or anything that requires you to provide a balanced argument with more than 1 side of the argument  it's most likely marked by levels. However  typically for point-marked questions  those with ""lower order"" command words like ""describe"" requires 1 point/mark  and command words like ""explain"" can carry 2 marks for 1 clearly-elaborated point.",btohqsg
Hope u do well for your exam,btohqsg
Your taking your A levels this year???,btohqsg
