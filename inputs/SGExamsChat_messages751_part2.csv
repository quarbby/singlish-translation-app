"i mean it cant be said enough ""what you do for someone in the name of love is unexplainable""..but then general consensus in this case is not a r/s for my explanation",btohqsg
All of which u gotta delineate between romantic love interest and just simply liking their company,btohqsg
not really my point but sure,btohqsg

But not love I don't expect and it simply is unprofessional for love in the biological sense to occur between patient and a healthcare professional,btohqsg
