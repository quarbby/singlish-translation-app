Hi guys  for Kris+ app  the miles from payments made with Kris Pay and redeeming of miles from like banks etc  will all be reflected in the app  is that correct?,btohqsg
Good afternoon gurus  would like to seek advice on how to calculate the miles I am getting. I used to charge to the uob kf card but realised I should have clock it to my newly acquired uob ppv card. However  I am not sure how do I check if miles or points were awarded for the transactions. Anyone could advise please?,btohqsg
UOB PPV  check in UOB Tmrw app after transaction is posted  10 UNI$ per $5. Must be mobile contactless or whitelisted online.,btohqsg
With the options you have from SYFE  you might be better off investing iShares US Index Fund (IE) S&P 500 in Endowus. With lesser overall fees.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfqPsoyj2ANot financial advice.,btohqsg
For interbank giro. The transaction will take place one day before the due date?,btohqsg
Depends. Which bank to which bank?,btohqsg
Any1 know where i can find compilation of mcc?,btohqsg
Usually. Sometimes on the day itself.,btohqsg
Do note it might not be 100% accurate. Just a guideline.,btohqsg
If it nv happens after 6pm. I should do it manual?,btohqsg
Please do. Better be safe than get charged w interest and late fee.,btohqsg
Does it specifically state GIRO payment on the statement in the first place? If it doesn't  just make the manual payment.,btohqsg
The giro approve after the statement date.Mean most probably won’t happen this month?Anyway the due date is on the 27th. As long as I monitor and pay it on 27th. Should be fine right?Maybe I will just take it as long no deduction after 5pm  I do it manually.,btohqsg
The GIRO approved after statement date then only the next statement will start. But check to be sure.Suggest to pay on 26th  just in case.,btohqsg
Cool. Thanksss I will follow up till 26th and manual it if it din happen.,btohqsg
Printed on last page of the statement.,btohqsg

hi credit card shifus  any recommendation for credit card (miles) if monthly spend around $20kthanks,btohqsg
All retail  dining and shopping spends or inclusive of loans  utilities etc?,btohqsg
for shopping and dining and retail,btohqsg
Bro  I think you will need all the usual 4mpd cards and still have left over to absorb.Here are some ways to exhaust it1. DBS Women $1 5002. Amaze + CRMC $1 0003. UOB Lady’s $2 0004. UOB PPV $1 1105. UOB VS $2 000Remainder: Uncapped UOB KrisFlyer $12 3903mpd on selected categories. Use the above to catch all first as this card has some caveats. You’ll need to spend $800 for the 3mpd on select categories.Your breakdown on the actual expenses you’ll have to do yourself and see if the cards above make sense.,btohqsg
Can you recommend a credit card for managing high-ticket purchases  typically around $7 000 to $8 000 per month?Additionally  how flexible are retail stores when it comes to splitting payments into smaller transactions? (never tried it before),btohqsg
I’ll be honest. I’m lazy haha. If I need to swipe these amounts I’ll use Vantage or Maybank VI whose annual fees can be waived with $60k spending a year and absorb it.Vantage gives free hotel stays and discounts at Accor hotel buffets and Maybank VI allows you to get points for insurance and education.,btohqsg
Want high reward typically need multiple card. Or else can only be those general spending card.,btohqsg
Retail stores then have to ask them.. 7-8k you can consider uob privi as it can meet the 50k spent for additional 20k miles.,btohqsg
Hi all  just to seek some advice here. I have never looked into CPF and tax relief before but now I did a little research and would like some advice.Info: 30MCpf balances: OA:92k SA:29k MA: 35kSingle  not planning to get married or buy house  current hdb is fully paid1. Should I do cpf topup to qualify for the 8k tax relief? If so  shld i do vcma or rstu? Im in the 40-80k tax bracket (7%). Alr topup $600 to my mum earlier this year for the MRSS scheme. So I can top up another $7 400. Personally  I feel that vcma is better? This is to hit BHS earlier and supercharge SA.2. Should I transfer my OA balances to SA? Since im not planning to buy a house  the SA 4% interest is much better than the OA 2.5% interest. The transfer from OA to SA also help me to bit FRS faster.Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I remember alipay or WeChat pay has limit per day,btohqsg
Once you transfer OA to SA there is no going back. You can invest OA in tools to try and get similar or higher returns then SA. If you transfer and next time you wanna use the funds to buy house in future you cannot transfer back btw,btohqsg
For china payment  other than WeChat and alipay and ocbc scan  you can also open a saving account with icbc and get their debit card  put money there and withdraw money from icbc ATM in china  the rate good as well  I did it last time,btohqsg
My advice is to not top up and invest the cash. Tax relief makes sense only if it is hitting very high brackets (15%-22%) and at $40k  I think it is much better at this time to do investment instead.Not financial advice disclaimer and please do your own research.,btohqsg
Thanks for the replies. I am not savvy in cpf investment and my risk appetite is not high. Where should i start if i want to do OA investment?,btohqsg
Im not planning to buy a house in the future  and my current hdb is fully paid. Thats why leaving such a huge amt in OA is not that wise imo...,btohqsg
Can confirm is within 40k or 80k? First 40k only up to 3.5%. Not worth to throw any money for tax relief  deposit money in bank also can cover that.IMO if really not going to use OA  just transfer all to SA.Not financial advice.,btohqsg
Within 80k. Meaning $550 on the first $40k and 7% on the next $40k. Sorry if this is unclear in my original post.,btohqsg
If you not comfortable in investing your cash or investing in any way  can just RSTU $8k to self if you never RSTU/VCMA to self yet. Then ride on the risk free 4%. Likely to beat inflation  and reduce taxes  but that's about it.,btohqsg
It is worth doing vcma 8k correct? To hit BHS earlier and supercharge SA. As well as tax relief,btohqsg
Honestly for your situation no difference. You're still some time away from hitting BHS / to see your MA interest supercharge anything. Long run RSTU will have more but insignificant amount of tax relief opportunities.Only if you willing to invest the monies then you need to give more thoughts.,btohqsg
Quick question! I’ve new-to-bank status for Citi  and applied for Citi SMRT CC in Nov. Because of my status  I’m eligible for $450 paynow reward (with SingSaver).Criterial is I need to spend $500 in first month. I did spend $900+ getting a new iPhone - now my concern is it doesn’t count because Citi SMRT recognises MCC from Online Purchases  Groceries  Taxi and Public Transport only.For my situation  will I get the $450 paynow reward from SingSaver?,btohqsg
If MCC excluded in promo t&c then no,btohqsg
