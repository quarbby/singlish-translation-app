idk what you mean by this but ok,btohqsg
no my point was how people no longer think or never knew sg had a literal US military establishment for the US Navy right here in sg.,btohqsg
"my cross-counter points were these messages1. singapore was always having to thread on thin ice (be careful) with political ties and trying to maintain neutrality or it's ""wait-and-see"" stance before making decisions1a) even MP Gan Siow Huang of PAP who was an ex-bridgadier general in the army  and current Minister of State for Manpower & Education   of Marymount Single-Member Constituency  confirmed this in a Q&A session of a Students Perspective  Dialogue Talk2) you can't judge political relations or how close political ties are with different nations based on a single idea that ""location of XX companies or army base"" somewhere (reply to your comment on how the States don't have any more naval bases or ships docked at SG ports)2a) ryan  this wasYOUR counter replywas from the following before and after messages in between my last few sent messages2b) this was my following responses to disagreeing with your opinionbro  did you forget to consider stuff like land rights authority  the stability of THEIR currency vs OURS ( or basically a currency that can ""sometimes"" go on par almost comparably with those country currencies that have a very high market price )  NATURAL / LOCAL materials +  amenities + resources offered with ease?are u insane ( replying toyour random analogy+further elaboration&random fact about a US ship visiting or docking at  Malaysia port..?3) my response to your random analogy  elaboration and fact check mentioned in point (2a) is that you're jumping way too fast without any further elaboration  clarification or tied to the previous points you've raised until confusion arises between both you and the other party (which is me  this time)i somewhat understand where you're trying to come from  and even say but you're nowhere near on the same page or being able to row in co-ordination and tacit understanding with me LOL",btohqsg
if they wanted to know  they'll (tourists  visitors or those enthusiants / hobbyist ) WILL find ways to outsource or get ahold of any clue to the sort of information / stuff they want to look up on,btohqsg
this applies to both searching on the internet AND personally going down to ask people for more info,btohqsg
don't mind that reply  the unedited message was a message full of typos and written grammatical errorsit was supposed to be something meaning like this:i was  geenrally trying to consider the bigger picture,btohqsg
if anyone's not comfy or this is too political for sgexams  let us know and we'll take it to dms,btohqsg
this is an ordinary debatable discussion ryan and myself hold every few weeks (usually once every month),btohqsg
in hindsight  any country's decision to place a military installation in said country must mean to a certain extent there is comforbility between both nations. (US)any country's decision to also work with and to place a industrial hub in said country must also mean to a certain extend there is comforbility between both countries as well (China)Hence the idea of the Singapore treading a fine line. Yea i know you said you can't judge political relations or ties in details but you dont need to go indepth into relations to realise that both have strong enough ties they are willing to even collaborate on something together is basically my point.If your country has to do business with country B whom has a military prescence from Country C but you and Country C are at odds with each other..its very tough to do business with country BSo even if you say you cant determine  it pretty much shows a certain threshold for the state of politics between both nations.Also Gan said that but SG was also quick to completely ban a indonesian navy ship from ever entering singapore or ever participating with the sg navy in any exercises water all because of the indonesian navy decision for the name of the ship. For reference  this incident would have been like japan not allowing a US ship called USS Hiroshima to enter or help japan.,btohqsg
but yea thats all i have for this discussion,btohqsg
yea they got alot of ships,btohqsg
16 aircraft carriers is crazy  85 submarines is mad,btohqsg
Added data point: Our neighbours are beginning to surpass us in terms of cultural exports,btohqsg
Thai BL dramas  Vietnamese and Filipino pop music  Vietnamese fashion  Indonesian and Filipino video games...,btohqsg
this website is madly inaccurate with counting the list of active equipment a single country has,btohqsg
i mean it shows ships that are not even made yet,btohqsg
USS Enterprise (CVN-80)USS Doris Miller (CVN-81)USS Maine (CVN-82)are scheduled aircraft carrier commissions waiting to get started with the project building OR those models are simply in-completed...so it'll be 10 + 2 = 12 active aircraft carriers,btohqsg
who the fuck needs to know about future stuff and worry about it,btohqsg
i lost my drafted message i wanted to reply to you earlier,btohqsg
And in terms of cuisine? Yeah  it's not even a competition. Our neighbours are lightyears ahead on this front. Even Malaysia is beginning to have some success on this front.Our only bright spots are watch microbrands and some small success in indie games.,btohqsg
we were never once a competition or good reference for such comparisons like; rich historical records  accessible cultural information ( more towards language dialects  customs etc )  navy / ground force / air force presence  imports + exports  cuisines  entertainment circle in terms of acting / music / film / movies / creative arts in general  psychology  socially impactful eventsand finally normalizing being taught from young or in school consistently stage-by-stage that everyone should learn more abouti. financial literacyii.emotional managementbrushing up on productivity (sic.) with better discipline in scheduling timingsiii. self-developmentiv. character growth with maturityv. healthy ways to deal with stress ( unhealthy vs healthy methods of coping mechanisms )vi. further mental health awareness ( in terms trying to reduce stigmatisation where derogatory discrimination and stereotypes happens every single time and in different types of environments )vii. MORAL BELIEFS or a CORE VISIONARY with VALUES to stick with instead of following the god damned majority opinion or going with the flow,btohqsg
Personally I would recommend people do C++ before transition to Python.Because Python would be much easier  after you realized you can include library packages.Then go start go look into Data Analytics.,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/@drlokeDr Loke from NTU  also have a good full recorded lectures on Data Structures and Logarithms,btohqsg
iirc python and computer language c++ seems pretty similar with overlapping functions just that the format is a bit different,btohqsg
data anal seems so oversaturated nowadays,btohqsg
but everywhere I look ppl are asking for data analysts,btohqsg
nothing wrong with C++  but I think C++ builds better fundamentals in programming compared to Python.,btohqsg
it's like how japanese have kanji and koreans have hanja have taken inspiration from chinese's mandarin characters but they are made into different variations,btohqsg
python is more for basic algorithm training or coding language mastery,btohqsg
it's kinda like the normalized trend of collective english version for coding languages ,btohqsg
as long it pays well. and job is easy. lol.,btohqsg
u apply also with data analytical background or qualifications  cannot even guarantee getting employment place,btohqsg
my friend consulted me his company have a test report plotter  dump out variables x  y  z into .csv files.They wanted outsource  the data plotting mechanism into an interactive plot for RM 3k. Just because their test engineers required to compile the results by Excel. But lazy enough to write few lines of code to plot it...ðŸ’€,btohqsg
"For context:At our height  we produced 3 Mandopop A-listers with majority original discographies within the space of 5 years in an era where one in *20* years was considered goodThere's an old question on çŸ¥ä¹Ž (China's equivalent to Quora) from around 2012 or so that translates to ""Why are the Singaporeans so good at music?""MediaCorp also used to EXPORT DRAMAS TO CHINA. SUCCESSFULLY.",btohqsg
i told my friend  that plotter I coded before only takes less than 100 lines of code. I wrote it during my Graduate Trainee period over at Intel... within a weekðŸ’€,btohqsg
does your friend not  complete his own module work / class assignments assignments,btohqsg
or understand what in the world he studies,btohqsg
I asked back him  his company so damn lazy  pretty sure this can be done in ChatGPT nowadays.,btohqsg
Programming/Engineering not his forte. He did Mechanical  I did Electrical & Electronics in the same uni. lol.,btohqsg
we went to the same Introduction to C++ together lol,btohqsg
you know why? it's because singapore is so small with how limited opportunities can get  you can probably only go through IMDA ( Info-comm Media Development Authority ) or MediaCorp channels to be locally famous,btohqsg
doesn't mechanical engineering courses learn a little bit about tech softwares / codes as well,btohqsg
Singapore has lost cause of Thai BL Dramas,btohqsg
idk if what i know of electrical & mechanical engi would be similar to what you study,btohqsg
yeahh  intro to programming is common nowadays.,btohqsg
eventually every uni students doing Engineering:--> C++ / Python  ---> Transition to MATLAB for modelling,btohqsg
plus  even local entertainment media outreach isn't as good as it is  as compared to a few years ago,btohqsg
if he's struggling even with some introductory CODING course module or classes  good job he's fucked,btohqsg
I'm confused as to why we think that SG now is undergoing the lost decade when we are still living in the same decadeYou can just say we lost our competitiveness doesn't mean we are in a lost decade tbf in fact that's like kinda not rly the same thing,btohqsg
welp. Mechanical Engineering kills more brain cells than Electrical/Electronics Engineering.,btohqsg
