Tng have a reward program of their own to redeem merchant voucher so i am all for tng,btohqsg
Plus i dont need to carry too much cash and deal with the loose change,btohqsg
Yes I always feel cashless is more hygienic.,btohqsg
So just need to make sure u have data when go malaysia  amt can be top up anytime as long as u have access to otp and internet.,btohqsg
Anyone has annual fee rejected waiver request before by standard chartered?,btohqsg
If no RM then how haha  not a banking acc customer,btohqsg
Itâ€™s probably their strategy to reduce their credit card customer base. Donâ€™t ask me why. But recent months many dp that scb refuse to waive annual fee.For myself even with rm appeal took over 1 month. I paid the fee first then they credit back,btohqsg
If you cancel the cc do u still need to pay for the annual fee?,btohqsg
Question. If I want to use cardup for 100K payment  it is best to use UOB KF card since it is uncapped. Right?,btohqsg
Cos itâ€™s a flexi account . Allows me to withdraw 30 days later after I notify them,btohqsg
Cardup transaction only give base rate so better off with uob privi  unless you have those high income earner card.,btohqsg
Any monthly cap on UOB Privi?,btohqsg
No cap  it is a general spending card that come with 3 version  amex  visa  master,btohqsg
That is good. I will then be able to get the max miles for the 100K.,btohqsg
Using cardup wonâ€™t affect right? From hsbc pov  it is just dependent on whether 1% cashback is still eligible for paying cc bills,btohqsg
Yes correct  hsbc wont know what u clock on other bank cc,btohqsg
even u directly link credit card to amaze and top up tng  it is still no fees,btohqsg
Ok thank you! I just submitted my giro forms for cc and car loans etc  trying to figure out how to tap in cardup now. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Yes but the rate suck and no reward,btohqsg
oh yes true that makes sense  i should do that too,btohqsg
citi cashback used to give cashback for tng wallet top up through amaze  now no more,btohqsg
Did they? Tng mcc is 6540 and citicashback plus is 1.6 cashback compare to amaze spot rate of 2-2.5  still dont make sense,btohqsg
yes they did  been using over a few years. only past few months i notice no more cashback,btohqsg
Bank are covering all the loophole,btohqsg
Exactly. Now not safe to discuss too much in open forums. Not that there are many loopholes left.,btohqsg
so actually for all myr transaction  its better to top up wallet and use myr from there isnt it? in amaze,btohqsg
even if im directly using contactless  i only got ~3.44 rate 2 weeks ago on direct amaze card linked to cc  if i use top up wallet and convert to myr  around 3.52,btohqsg
But u forgot the cc reward,btohqsg
I still use cc with amaze by default at place that take card and those that dont i use tng  but please dont treat it like a remittance service as it will cause it to be nerf like ichange. System not mean to be abuse.Cause i just to top up with amaze wallet and the payment got reverse by amaze  have to see if it is working.,btohqsg
i use citi cashback only  1.6%  not as good as compared to the wallet direct conversion,btohqsg
I use maybank fnf with amaze in malaysia,btohqsg
And seriously if everytime info is been shared and it get nerf coz ppl abuse it then i dont think any one will want to share anymore,btohqsg
Wah  country garden tio suspendedâ€¦ scary siah ..,btohqsg
I see I see.. no point then. Can just register for new account.,btohqsg
But i have try to top up tng with amaze wallet just now  all reverse so hopefully not a perm thing. Still working fine on 7 apr,btohqsg
Update: got my 6.8% p.a. bonus cash coupon credited (at the end of 60 days exactly) and submitted for withdrawal. Previous 1 Feb campaign,btohqsg
reverse? i just topped up $20 it was ok,btohqsg
I try to use my myr in my amaze wallet to top up tng  even 20 myr got reverse,btohqsg
Not sure why mine got rejected,btohqsg
Will try again tml maybe coz going to jb on thursday,btohqsg
Just do small amt first if anyone is new  dont pump in big amt then trigger some alert coz new tng acct have the tendacy to trigger fraud alert when topping up big amt,btohqsg
Hi  for hospital bill (8062)  do I still earn miles if I use Citi+amaze ?,btohqsg
if on android  from the uob tmrw app can add onto google pay,btohqsg
I don't know if this counts as a hack..Recently I introduced Tuaspower to a number of my friends  and as they usually just do BANK GIRO for their power and SP Power bills  I volunteered to help them pay their monthly SP Power bills (Tuaspower is SP Power billing) and I give them 2% discount (win win).This can easily help you meet your $2k per month UOB One spending tier requirement.As long as the house owner invites you to their SP App family  you will be able to easily see and pay their SP Bill with your own SP App.,btohqsg
Yeah of course... decades old friends  and their downstreamthe topic started when they asked me which Power company to recontract with,btohqsg
Yea I did that but I'm overseas right now so wanna add into Amaze instead,btohqsg
Anyone know why UOB one isnâ€™t giving the quarters rebate??,btohqsg
Guys  any impact to credit rating if leaving a card stagnant for long ah? Thinking if to apply a Maybank card just to secure a concert ticket priority purchase but don't really see much value in adding one more card to my CC stash...,btohqsg
Hi anyone got any suggestion for what my next card should be?Currently hold UOB Ladys  Privimiles and KF CC,btohqsg
Just ask ppl u know who have maybank card to help,btohqsg
