For HSBC Revo user  can check if manual payment at AXS MACHINE for insurance or bills still earn you 4md?Thanks,btohqsg
The HSBC Revo TnC did mention on this. You can read the TnC.,btohqsg
Earn 0 miles instead of 0.4 miles. Does not earn bonus miles based on MCC.,btohqsg
IMO  if you are not using your OA for investment or HDB  transfer to SA to get the additional interest is recommended. If you have extra cash to top up your SA before FRS to earn tax relief. This remains unchanged,btohqsg
Perhaps check chat history using ‚Äúamaze refund‚Äù,btohqsg
but singsaver says this. 0.5%?? :O,btohqsg

so before mar 24  what are the benefits of uob cc?,btohqsg
ok la at least got boardmefirst ü•≤,btohqsg
What is the benefit of boardmefirst?,btohqsg
"not much  u just become the first group to board (which means no need fight for cabin ""luggage space"")actually experienced it first hand during my last trip",btohqsg
Anybody use complimentary seat selection before ? Is this benefit allowed you to manual seat selection or they auto assign seat for you?,btohqsg
Is there any ocbc 365 cc sign up promo now,btohqsg
I thought cabin luggage space is always sufficient for everyone? I never encountered insufficient space.,btohqsg
You manual select before using complimentary seat selection ?I heard it is auto assigned by system. Is it true?,btohqsg
paiseh  i meant carry on luggage if there's a diff. last trip i went the person who went after me didn't had much space because my travel partner and i  had two carry-on luggages so that ate quite alot of space,btohqsg
I roughly recall one hahaha  but i rmb manually selecting cause i asked for a window seat and paid for my partner's seat (like... a specific seat),btohqsg
they assign you some seats first  then you can change them within the STANDARD SEATS if you want  any charges will be waived.https://milelion.com/2022/06/01/psa-scoots-ridiculous-complimentary-seat-selection-perk/,btohqsg
Possible to have insufficient  I encounter before they asked people before boarding to check in luggage for free,btohqsg
if flying out from Narita  many jokers like me might carry on 2-3 bags of duty free snacks... sure no space one,btohqsg
oh  this i tio before also (another flight)But overall the idea is that i get some assurance my luggage is above me so i don't have to like move around too much when landing and wanting to disembark from the plane,btohqsg
Just put it in other luggage space above other passenger if still have empty space  Right?,btohqsg
"up to indiv lo  imagine u got plastic bag got luggage u also dont want partition between different ""shelves"" ma",btohqsg
and u don't want other people heavy luggage crushing your precious snacks,btohqsg
Hi experts  I have a technical question - the FRS for 2025 is $213K.If my SA balance reaches above $213K as at 31 Dec 2025  after the interest is added  would this mean I have reached the FRS balance already and I cannot RSTU anymore?,btohqsg
wait for FRS limit to be raised on 1st Jan 2026 then quickly topup,btohqsg
I am wondering if the tax saved from RSTU will outweigh the interest earned when FRS is reached.,btohqsg
depends how good you are at investments.there are people who don't do SRS for the same reasons.,btohqsg
Hi to those that have bought savvy endowment via DBS app to tick the Insurance component for Multiplier  how soon is the policy incepted from the date of online application? ie if I bought today when is the policy incepted? Thank you.,btohqsg
Interest will be credited on 31 Dec. there is no chance for you to topup SA anymore once reached FRS. You can only topup your Medisave.,btohqsg
Nice to meet you all :),btohqsg
