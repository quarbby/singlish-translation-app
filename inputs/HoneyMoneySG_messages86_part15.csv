Uob monthly spending of $500 for Uob one account interest,btohqsg
Really no data point but somehow online articles lead pointing towards recurring payments but not online..,btohqsg
Sighâ€¦ ok  maybe Iâ€™ll give calling UOB a try,btohqsg
Hi all  UOB PPV for Xnap can get 4mpd?,btohqsg
If it is a recurring payment then would it be eligible for UOB ladyâ€™s?,btohqsg
Uob ladyâ€™s doesnâ€™t matter online or offline as long as MCC is correct.,btohqsg
If I pay direct to HDB? Does it consider as mo monthly spending?,btohqsg
Iâ€™m using hsbc revo for fitness first and every month I get the 4mpd. so Iâ€™m guessing should be online for recurring.,btohqsg
Likely to be considered under govt services as well. So its under exclusion.,btohqsg
Can one apply for both hsbc revo and travel one credit card and be eligible for both gifts with spending of $500x2 and make payment of annual fee?,btohqsg
anyone applied fixed depo for cimb? how long would it take to approve?,btohqsg
Hellooo anyone applied singsaver and hsbc revolution in nov 2023 received their gift yet or any update?,btohqsg
1 only the other will be recorded as existing user,btohqsg
But in the tnc they are saying travel one will not affect your status as new card member? So I am abit confused if I apply travel one first then apply revo  how does this works? In terms of the gifts,btohqsg
That TnC should be for HSBC definition but not singsaverApplying HSBC revo first then T1Chris post also state the optimal way to register.T1 fuliment for the $20k miles is from HSBC itself not singsaverIn HSBC eyes T1 will have the $20k even if you are an existing userWhile HSBC revo advance etc is $250 is by singsaver,btohqsg
Spent $150 at T4 duty free on 22/1 got 10x points for CRMC x Amaze,btohqsg

crmc card gets free access to all lounge?,btohqsg
They are talking about citi premiermiles,btohqsg
Kinda weird... transactions on 20th is still 1x tho... wonder if you guys are getting the same as mine..,btohqsg
How do u guys even check ?!,btohqsg
Based on my spending? I spent 1k and the points is only 8k... so obviously the latest transaction of $200 does not captured the 10x point,btohqsg
Ownself do excel for manual calculation for Citi Rewards ThankYou pointsbut if you want a ready made solution  here is a paid versionhttps://ko-fi.com/s/aec00be2a2,btohqsg
Hi everyone  Iâ€™ve recently signed up for the Citi rewards card via MoneySmart. If I were to pair it with the amaze card and use it for overseas spend such as dining and retail  will I still qualify for the sign up reward? There is a minimum spend of $500 to earn this reward.,btohqsg
Amaze transactions will always convert to local spend. If your card needs to clock overseas spend then it won't be eligible for the spend.,btohqsg
You already said 20th Jan. itâ€™s back to normal for 22th Jan onwards.,btohqsg
My transaction on 19 Jan got 10x,btohqsg
Thats why lo... see who else also having the same issue,btohqsg
Affected transactions started from 19 Jan evening. Exact timing was not known  likely anytime after 630pm.,btohqsg
Guys  can share how do I see the points awarded? I login in to internet banking  scouted through the transactions and the rewards page  still canâ€™t find the points awarded for per transaction. Thanks.,btohqsg
need to track manually via your excel for the ThankYou points of crmc.you can refer to the app for summed up allocations of your points.,btohqsg
