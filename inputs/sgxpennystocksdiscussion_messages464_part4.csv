Added and averaged down more Amos Group $0.015. This price should be the bottom. I cannot imagine them going any lower. the BBs tested and they know that the big shareholders Teo and Lien are not selling this price. Todat T+4 from Monday spike to $0.018.Collect $0.015 too hard to lose. Next week i believe Amos will have Spike up. Honestly i believe consolidation will happen at either of the above prices $0.015/$0.020/$0.025. I think $0.020 makes sense to me.Does not makes much sense for ShawKwei to consolidate at lower prices. If i were in i would consolidate at higher prices for sure. Lets see.,btohqsg
