Lol I dun think there's enough rich in Singapore to buy that many cat b,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so too  but you‚Äôd be surprised,btohqsg
Singapore is the most expensive place on planet earth to buy cars‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
cannot be whole of Singapore only buying premium cars mah...,btohqsg
anyway what's the current number prefix? SNE?,btohqsg
Same  I spotted a few Honda HRVs/Vezel and Teslas with this plate already,btohqsg
Wah I have yet to spot any SNF vehicles,btohqsg
Im looking forward to see 2022-04 data when the COE finally hits $100küòÜ,btohqsg
Still be the same‚Ä¶ cos the more expensive it is the more they Want to buy it,btohqsg
I guess its a form of motivation to them!,btohqsg
https://onemotoring.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/onemotoring/Buying/Car_Cost_Update/M032-Car_Cost_Update.pdfThis data also useful to know how much margin they are actually earning. It gets updated every month.,btohqsg
I believe it‚Äôs Tesla. Becoz their contract allows them to bid up to 15% from the 3 month moving average of COE.,btohqsg
Their model of sales so far is good. No frills no AD markups.,btohqsg
No unfortunately  but working towards 1. üòÜ,btohqsg
And a strong believer of EVs.,btohqsg
Don't think its Tesla. They delivery numbers are small.,btohqsg
Remember to share some pics of your ride here after you buy itüòâ,btohqsg
Actually ya fair too. Or could it be still those ADs bidding for event cars?,btohqsg
Last year a lot of companies performed better than 2020 so the bonus paid this year is generally much better‚Ä¶..there are a lot of buyers,btohqsg
Pty price high‚Ä¶. Sell got profit ..::,btohqsg
I think it is all round the market. Not just these. Just too few COEs,btohqsg
Can bid before cars arrive also,btohqsg
Yes but with a 6 month validity on the COE  you are taking a risk that your Tesla will be delivered in time. Don't think many will take the risk. At the end of the day  the registered numbers are small and that's a fact. So Tesla isn't the main cause of the high COEs  the other ADs are more than responsible for it as well.,btohqsg
Just for clarification  I don't own a Tesla. I wish I did but to see how Tesla is always mentioned as the cause of the high COE  I don't think that's an accurate comment. The way the COE bidding works with the last successful price bid and the total number of Tesla cars registered  it is clearly that the other ADs are similarly bidding up the COE price.,btohqsg
Cause alot of buyer like to use +15% during coe bidding   that why the conception hehe,btohqsg
I see the flaw in my own assumption now. Thanks for clarifying!,btohqsg
But what I don‚Äôt understand is  how does the AD still maintain their margins if they also keep bidding high?,btohqsg
Or   willing to pay more too? Less price sensitive,btohqsg
Then they ‚Äúhide‚Äù say COE goes up,btohqsg
Yes ‚Ä¶highly . Inelastic demand‚Ä¶. For that few brands,btohqsg
The price sensitive ones like Perodua registered a grand total of  X cars,btohqsg
Actually can last longer than 6 months but must go to LTA to 'renew',btohqsg
Mitsubishi who used to sell tons of lancers now is‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
Daihatsu which provided the charades and character cars like YRV  GTTi  copen now is finished,btohqsg
Suzuki of the immensely popular swift is also finished,btohqsg
FORD the great American üá∫üá∏ company has no cars that fits euro 6 for sale in Singapura at the moment,btohqsg
For luxury car the margin cost around the coe   lot of margin to play,btohqsg
Oh I did not know that!,btohqsg
Think nowadays  Tesla is doing +5% only?,btohqsg
I think their contract is 5   10 or 15 and -5.,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a Tesla owner here maybe he can shed some light,btohqsg
the people 'bidding up' the COEs is transparent. The new car registration by brand table confirms it. Every one of those cars bought a COE and therefore bidded on them. Its actually pretty straightforward. As the COE price goes up though  you can expect the premium brands to capture more of the COEs  since people bidding high prices on COEs will probably be buying more expensive cars seeing as they can better afford them,btohqsg
U can choose retain same rate +5% or +15%   so if u want confirm coe is just +15%   the good thing is that you won‚Äôt need to pay +15% if the price close is lower then +15%,btohqsg
Example coe is 100 k and close at 108 k   if you bid for +15%   you still pay 108k,btohqsg
Get ready. Malaysian TP's love to meet and greet Singaporeans when driving in. Ha..ha..ü§£üòõüòú,btohqsg
Would need dealer to write in on behalf to explain tho.,btohqsg
"I have always felt that the ""packaged"" price offered by the ADs that include COEs is fundamentally wrong. ADs should just sell the cars and mark up cars according to market demand. COEs on the other hand should be left to the owner to bid themselves.",btohqsg
IMO ADs are offering package deals of car + COE because thats what buyers want. IMO buyers should take the blame for this system. Even now you are more than able to bid for your own COE  but no one ever does it. They just want everything packaged together. So this is the system we have. If everyone bidded for COEs on their own and demanded to pay machine price only  dealer would stop or scale back package deals. But this will never happen because if buyers bid on COEs themselves  they wont be able to take loans for their COEs which guarantee will eliminate 80-90% of car buyers from buying a car,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not the buyer but the ADs dun want to sell to non pacakge pple,btohqsg
Or they sell u last and at same or higher price than u go for package so‚Ä¶. A bit LPPL lah,btohqsg
And yes the system of having to pay for the COE first‚Ä¶.. actually this is not a problem ‚Ä¶. The bank will lend cos its fully secured‚Ä¶.. u dun pay  I surrender ur paper to LTA,btohqsg
this is a chicken an egg problem. buyers have asked ADs to package COE with the car for decades. Their entire pricing system works on a package. So they are reluctant to decouple car and COE but they will do it if you are buying a car from them worth the trouble. But if you are just buying a corolla why should they bother when they can just sell another 853 to someone else who wants a simpler package deal,btohqsg
And that's where policies are a little weird. On one hand advocating financial prudence and serviceable debt ratios. On the other hand  allow loans for a non-tangible-asset i.e. COE - where is a license to own a vehicle. I don't recall any other license or certificates that are recognized and can obtain a bank loan to repay the license fees. Only our dearest COE.,btohqsg
Exactly!!!! It‚Äôs the ADs and not the buyers,btohqsg
No   self bid coe also can be loan   my car loan also includes coe and I bid +15% to gurantee the coe,btohqsg
yes fair point  COE loans do exist. The interest rates are not on par with car loan prices though. And this still begs the question  if its so easy to get a COE  then why dont buyers buy them? I dont think potential rejection by AD is a good enough reason. I still think buyers are lazy or uninformed,btohqsg
This is the no 1 brainchild of dun which 3 great scholars ( Â§ß‰∏âÂÖÉÔºâ,btohqsg
No paper‚Ä¶.Every 2 weeks collect cash flow,btohqsg
btw i am not an AD. not trying to defend them. just trying to take a balanced view. ADs are in business to make money so they give customers what they want. I dont think its correct or fair to blame ADs for our system,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok lah   either u have done it or u have not asked around before‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
If u are buying   ironically   the super cars  yes u can bid yourself and they will sell to u,btohqsg
But will leak some news say u Bo liao  bid your own   so silly,btohqsg
Premium for COEs cannot be financed by bank loan. All must be fully paid before you can purchase a vehicle from a dealer. That will be the day!,btohqsg
ADs want to make money. Walk into any premium dealer with COE in hand and i guarantee you they will sell you a car with little or no financial penalty,btohqsg
Be careful what you wish for  cos if this happens  90% of current car buying public will probably never be able to afford a car lol,btohqsg
Maybe = No loan  less demand. Less demand  less costly COEs.,btohqsg
Sorry ah‚Ä¶. So if I want to renew a COE and I want a loan   I have to sell it to a dealer and buy back from dealer is it? Thanks,btohqsg
yes also possible. But always remember you are competing against people with a lot of money. In a situation where loans are not possible for COEs  you might see a very small % of people with cash to burn buying tons of 'cheap' COE/cars and squeezing out everyone else,btohqsg
at least loans will help to level the playing field a bit,btohqsg
Already many banks exit the car loans biz Liao,btohqsg
Valid points. But at the end of the day  loans inflate the affordability which results in higher prices. That's only good for the person collecting the premiums.,btohqsg
you will probably borrow from finance company and chop you nicely on interest rates,btohqsg
Blame it on the vanity lah of Sporeans :),btohqsg
Now is it max Loan 90? Or 70? Maybe can do like property  lower the LTV‚Ä¶. Might make it more balanced or reduce LTV for Cat B,btohqsg
it might be. But i think the only way to know for sure is to see what happens when they stop COE loans which probably wont happen. I am in the camp that COE loans will mean more equitable ownership distribution of cars (meaning not only very rich people get to own cars) but yes it might come at the expense of higher COE prices,btohqsg
Now is 40% down for bigger car   buy a lot of ppl go piDo 100% loan to pay high interest,btohqsg
"Car loans are 60 or 70% max. But there are ""loopholes""",btohqsg
Okie like the XX years old trick of over trade,btohqsg
Your views registered and I think they are valid. But abolishing COE loans are not in the interest of the controlling party - hence it is unlikely to ever see its day in light.,btohqsg
Actually is not loopholes   just a scheme   last time when I started work and loan 10 years with overtrade   when car is 9 years old I scrap it and got to pay 32 k,btohqsg
It‚Äôs silly to pay so much for most of us‚Ä¶. So it‚Äôs up to us to change our lifestyles:),btohqsg
Ya overtrade to reduce the down payment but u loan for 10 years with 3% intreast is pay until heart pain   even u scrap car still have to top up 32 k . Imagine car is total lost   sure lose money like crazy,btohqsg
That why they like u to sign 10 years loan   can milk u 10 years high interest,btohqsg
They will get u to trf the vehicle to them 1st. They will renew the coe and also the loan then they trf the vehicle back to u. Maybe u can check out platinum motoring,btohqsg
Thanks‚Ä¶ no wonder sometimes they will say one owner but 01 transfer due to COE loan,btohqsg
Then that‚Äôs where you are absolutely wrong. Bank will give loan based on collateral. And are you aware that if there is unused coe  you are able to ‚Äúsell‚Äù the coe back and get refunds? That is where the collateral is,btohqsg
It is because the coe has a guaranteed value (the remaining unused value) in a case of default by the debtor.Same as some insurance policies  with guaranteed 1st day value at 80% of the insurance policy. You are able to get a bank loan (premium financing) on it as well.Perhaps you should look into why coe is an asset that banks accept.,btohqsg
Sell Japanese car no future sia,btohqsg
Today you pay  say 100k for a 10yr coe. You take a bank loan and service for 2 years and you go into default. The bank is able to repossess your remaining 8 years coe  and it is guaranteed to be at 80k.Which other licenses have a guaranteed cash value?,btohqsg
When u default thet can sue you for bankruptcy,btohqsg
LoL for now is petrol vouchersüòÇ,btohqsg
Actually u can try that  u see if they charge u any lesser money.. they end up charging u admin charge or something. What's the point?,btohqsg
i have asked once or twice for price without COE. both times they discounted roughly whatever was the COE price at the time. it was not the exact COE price  they earned a few bucks  a very low 4 figure sum. i did not think it was unreasonable,btohqsg
this was many years ago btw,btohqsg
But is it worth the effort then? Since u are paying for a high priced item  what difference does it make then? I need to standby myself for a couple Wednesday to make sure I get my coe.. ü§®,btohqsg
worth the effort there and then? probably not. but it would work very well for a guy who maybe already bidded and secured his coe a few months back  at a lower price,btohqsg
AD discounts the coe price giving you a net lower price if you use your own COE. dealer wins  you win. makes sense to me,btohqsg
Cannot give you all perishable items leh,btohqsg
No lah‚Ä¶ I mean can claim free coconut drink from safra,btohqsg
I want one year free petrol supply,btohqsg
Wah that would be nice! Don't think it'll happen anytime soon though.,btohqsg
Not anytime soon‚Ä¶ means got chance for it to happen?,btohqsg
Maybe closer to 2040? When petrol slowly becomes obsolete? üòù,btohqsg
To meet sale. Target and remain dealership  u see lot of dealer buy back  maybe earn a profit from Coe then sell. Sgcarmart so many like 39km with. 9 years 6 mths coe,btohqsg

EV6 coming out hope is reasonable price,btohqsg
It will be a sight to see Petrol station slowly close down as electric cars takes over.,btohqsg
Actually no   entry level ev road tax is 1.5 k around there   but your petrol saving is easily 300 a month   and the arf rebate of 40 k   defiantly is a saving,btohqsg
300 a month is based on a usage like an average family car,btohqsg
Rebate u know when u scrap car its factored in? LOL,btohqsg
Gov dont give rebates for nth LOL like HDB,btohqsg
The arf rebate is given at the time of car purchase so if your car is 140 k the rebate will lessen it to 100 k and   if you do 100% loan it will be 100k loan instead of a 140 k loanYou can look at the 2nd hand price of ev cars and the value is holding very well.You can go and search like tesla used car and compare to new car price,btohqsg
LoL they just become ev station...I think their existence requires super speed charging e.g. full charge under 5 mins just like refuelling,btohqsg
Another example is if your car price is 100 k but u buy an ice with a surcharge of $20 k instead of rebate   it will cost you 120 k for the car and you will be paying 120 k price loan   but if the car is 100 k and the rebate is 60 k u only need to pay for 60K car loan,btohqsg
Currently with the ev rebate of 40 k   paying for ice car is really just pay too much for nothing,btohqsg
But of course hybrid got some rebate also la   just using a general example   as alot of ppl don‚Äôt seems bother about this rebate,btohqsg
What u gonna do to ev hoggers? If they hog the lot after full charge. U cant charge also. No doubt they will be charged idle fee  but u also LL,btohqsg
that's why i say every lot in mscp ma,btohqsg
Idle fee is like $1 per minute   hog 1 hour is $60,btohqsg
With that idle charging fee will deter just like ERP,btohqsg
Out of whole mscp if got 5 alrdy damn good,btohqsg
Some ppl rich and wallet damn deep. What is $60 to them lol,btohqsg
Others will follow as it is good money,btohqsg
There shld be a force release function in the app when its full charge to allow e next user to disconnect,btohqsg
But $60 is not like that waste also,btohqsg
That is only if they are willing to pay   and sure it will deter ppl,btohqsg
Then charge the prev user for hogging,btohqsg
but they still in the lot ma hahahha,btohqsg
Park infront of them liao. Hahaha,btohqsg
Later another RR case say no space cannot pass,btohqsg
That's why I say I'll only consider ev if charging points readily available.Or when their charger upgrade 0-100% in 5 mins.,btohqsg
Go in the lot  batt swop  out within 5mins and carry on with life,btohqsg
then all the companies need to make batt swap stn,btohqsg
Mus be a std battery tt all ev use. Den if theirs is higher capacity then need use more,btohqsg
U wait another 2-3yrs to see if value still hold then say lor.. battery life span cut  a lot more ev car owners still fighting for lots to charge.,btohqsg
Current I believe most ev owner are enjoying the ride and drive   it just adopting earlier as ice is gonna be obselute soon .,btohqsg
ICE won't die. It will just become the very minority. I believe hybrid and Electric will co-exist.,btohqsg
2030 no more coe for ice car liao,btohqsg
During this period value for ice car will be dropping as more and more ppll won‚Äôt look back to ice after driving ev,btohqsg
No new registrations for ICE car. But they will still roam the roads in much smaller population.,btohqsg
For the same reason I doubt petrol stations will completely go away too.,btohqsg
They will change to ev charging port already for the petrol station,btohqsg
unless we got ev lorries and buses  petrol stations still needed,btohqsg
Just my thought as u can see all carmakers are moving away from ice already and heavily investing on ev   goverment set law to and time to phase out ev   buying new ice in the next few years is just now worth it   as resale value might plunge a lot as buyer might avoid ice,btohqsg
Just hope EV can be really affordable lah and should have Seperate COE categ for this,btohqsg

We lucky we not 4 seasons if not tyres also need alot of types,btohqsg
Hidden cost is like   striking kerbs   tyre puncture  accident   drink spill in car and grooming,btohqsg
Like I recently just strike kerb and do up the rims for $70,btohqsg
I strike kerb and paid for new tyres too,btohqsg

Precisely Who in da right mind will do that? I mean Not even right of way. The car machiam Hollywood movie. Go so slow He lucky If not Bye. Probably trying to claim accident claim ? LOL now have to private settle with car LOL.,btohqsg
I think he turned his head left and right just for the sake of it leh. Its almost impossible not to spot an oncoming car....,btohqsg
Lets just say He cant Multi Task.,btohqsg
So not to curse him but he better dun ride on the road. Haha Potential Hazzard,btohqsg
yup  no helmet + protective gear also. Best is to just cycle on the sidewalk or park connector,btohqsg
at the end of the day the driver lugi,btohqsg
He probably dun give a flying fish about our law. Just like other arrogant cyclist still on the road. I am ok if they pose a hazzard to themself but please not to us hahaa,btohqsg
Got no way to make the cyclist take some responsibility for this accident?,btohqsg
Why? The driver lucky got this footage ahha if not police case,btohqsg
want bet at the end of the day court will say both parties wrong  cannot claim,btohqsg
Police case i believe got car cam. Sure working (Not working if its his fault) LOL,btohqsg
Im curious tho. What are the appropriate steps to take in such a situation?,btohqsg
No bet on such stuff sometimes all the driver need is luck but the rider really no follow law. So eventually polis will say Private settlement. LOL,btohqsg
they confirm say car see cyclist but never stop,btohqsg
For me1. Dun Panic2. Car cam3. Onlookers or Passing by car cam to help4. PolisCall insurance and ask if not sure,btohqsg
i kenna before someone run red light in the end they try push to me lol,btohqsg
'why u never slow down enough at junction?',btohqsg
No worries the car moving like lol. Actually looking at the footage even the car stop the cyclist also will hit the car,btohqsg
then what happen in the end?,btohqsg
you will still 'win' the case but the settlement alot lower,btohqsg
But I guess its better than nothing!,btohqsg
Actually in such situation just be reasonable on the amount of Private settlement,btohqsg
that incident i hospitalized for 3 months hahaha,btohqsg
If its just bump no dent nth lol i guess maybe a general amount should be ok. (Ex. $150/=),btohqsg
This is different liao. Need polis case and all.,btohqsg
all have  but he still fight like crazy. drag 2 years.,btohqsg

Manual is more fun than auto,btohqsg
For spare car in track yes   for only car in Singapore city driving is not ideal,btohqsg
manual is only more fun on roads that mostly do not exist in singapore. i have driven manuals for decades so i also know. lol,btohqsg
Yup sg so many traffic light   driving Manuel is a chores,btohqsg
True  my leg muscle pain if I drive whole day manual,btohqsg
can do mount faber and south buona vista runs at 4am lor,btohqsg
That's why I only drive on weekends,btohqsg
Might as well rent or buy a car in Malaysia for track,btohqsg
I prefer to drive manual over auto. So issues for me in heavy traffic,btohqsg
can a Singaporean buy and register a car in Malaysia?,btohqsg
I used to drive Manuel to auto to steptronjc to no gear,btohqsg
Usually thru a Malaysian relative or contact,btohqsg
for track use just buy unregistered,btohqsg
Singapore road to me is about fc   good fc like hybrid or ev,btohqsg
Got performance and good fc and easy to drive   as the road traffic light is too long,btohqsg
that means ownership will be under the Malaysian relative lah,btohqsg
Or u can just rent or ask a workshop settle for you,btohqsg
you can own a car as a foreigner but you might need a permanent address,btohqsg
or some long term visa like the MM2H,btohqsg
ah.. ok so buy an apartment first..,btohqsg

I owned a C4 5 seater Picasso BlueHDi before. Was a great car and love the suspension  smooth! BUT  engine is not reliable. Had unexpected lost of power and rattled badly. Sent to C&C for Servicing countless of time and the mechanics just inform me they just tweak the computer due to mid-ignition timing! What the hell! It wasn‚Äôt resolved throughout three years of warranty! Decided to sell off and surprised to find that Citroen resale values sucks like hell! Don‚Äôt buy the car for obvious reliability and maintenance reasons  unless you are French or you have a French wife. Sorry guys  French is good at flashy cars but not a reliable car. Friends also complain about Peugeot as well.,btohqsg
Very useful insights. I guess I will look at jap or Korea cars instead,btohqsg
But now new cars delivery also delayed right,btohqsg
Chip shortage blar blar plus high prices,btohqsg
Good Review. I rather eat French Fries =D,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sad to find that Continental cars are no longer build to last. Even German don‚Äôt build reliable cars anymore. Japanese and Korean are really good at making reliable cars but not as flashy in their design.,btohqsg
I think is country issue . Those cars are not meant for SG condition LOL,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admincan SgCarMart do a special review of Singapore most reliable car?,btohqsg
Continental entry cars  cannot make it,btohqsg
Better to go for higher end Japanese cars,btohqsg
there are plenty of flashy japanese cars but people dont want to pay the premium prices,btohqsg
manual saves fuel. and this is fun car.,btohqsg
Yeah true enough. Japanese cars dun really have to be high end or sth. I would say go for Honda/Toyota Engine more reliable down the road. LOL,btohqsg
and you can refuel in jb,btohqsg
Jap and Korea‚Äôs spare part are cheaper indeed,btohqsg
Drove a mz3 earlier‚Ä¶ for 5yrs   I din have any issue‚Ä¶ when I traded in  it‚Äôs like new car,btohqsg

Why Sorento when u can get Grandland? HAHA,btohqsg

I find old cars are more reliable as it is lesser reliant on electronics.,btohqsg

EV is still in the hype! Government wanna push? Make sure all Civil Servants drive EV including all police and fire engines. If there‚Äôs no economic or scales  Getting EV is just a go Green statement. Malaysia infrastructure to charge EV is also not common  although some folks at this platform disagrees before. But driving all the way to KL or Penang  you will definitely requires charging along the way  right?,btohqsg
maybe also i light footed a bit.,btohqsg
I can get 15km/l on my mz3. Not sure about the new mild hybrid mz3‚Ä¶ but it will definitely be better fc,btohqsg
Similar i also lol i on avg gets 15km/L on my GK3 Fit,btohqsg
Owned Renault  Volkswagen and Citro√´n before switching back to Toyota Hybrid,btohqsg
but ya other sedans I tried:Altis: Too old fashioned and expensive. Don‚Äôt buyCivic: The new one quite ok  only bad thing is halogen light and expensiveLexus IS: Very quiet  very good.Skoda Octavia: Feels like a Jetta  honestly nothing very nice about it.BMW 216 AT: Good handling for a mini MPV  but 12-13km/L  fuel guzzler.,btohqsg
ya good enough alr  dun need to vroom vroom in Singapore,btohqsg
Just look at the omv and spec u know how good is the car le,btohqsg
but for EVs so far I only tried Polestar 2. Really different experience and I‚Äôm very convinced that EV is the way to go.,btohqsg
Yeah. The A Class  1/2 series this kind all buy for badge only imo,btohqsg
Yeah lo plus i wish i can just change to anycar i want lol. Bo lui damn sian SG really Hais,btohqsg
I am so near to Polestar2 showroom but haven tried maybe later i should go LOL,btohqsg
I guess I will go for vezel or KIA compact SUV,btohqsg
Yes after u drive an ev u willl think ice car is so low and noisy and waste of petrol money,btohqsg
Not all. Check with sc when they can deliver by,btohqsg
Some delay  as well as missing parts,btohqsg
ya you should. Highly recommend. They just launched their standard range version  but ya  i need more real life reviews to decide in future if the range is suitable. it‚Äôs about 340km actuallly.,btohqsg
For a big car like Polestar2 340km abit cui lea i feel,btohqsg
Nissan Leaf maybe a better choice,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt have a dedicated charger   do take note of charging facilities for your car brand,btohqsg
That is around your work or home,btohqsg
I am wondering  do the chargers in our shopping malls compatible with all brands of EV?,btohqsg
so far the nearest i found near my home is a DC and AC but only 2 by SP Group,btohqsg
not too far  but too little.,btohqsg
yes it‚Äôs a bit low  they have the long range one with a bigger battery  but is 20k more expensive,btohqsg
Yes except for tesla charger that they have like in 5 malls for now,btohqsg
Range is important in ev like we can do a single charge drive to to kl,btohqsg
well ya a lot of things to consider in future. but i‚Äôm personally convinced that EV is the way to go.,btohqsg
Difference between ice and ev is that the bigger the engine the higher the fc is and that is your trade off   for ev is the smaller you it battery   the shorter the range and that is your trade off,btohqsg
I seen ppl trying to charge Thier ev at tesla charger before,btohqsg
Anyone Tried or drove Nissan Note E power? On  Full Tank can go how much Distance?,btohqsg
I agree too. But battery manufacturers have to be innovative and not rely on nickel  lithium and cobalt in the future. These minerals do not last forever.,btohqsg
Anyone can recommend workshop to replace airbag ecu. Kanna airbag error.Car Model golf 1.4 mk7 (2014),btohqsg
CarCreed  if you‚Äôre staying in the east. Used to bring my ex-golf there,btohqsg
Of course no   they spent so much money building charging station is to monopolize market,btohqsg
Any workshop good and reasonable  for car oil servicing package,btohqsg
Anyone can recommend a good car servicing ard Pioneer or Soon Lee area?Thanks...,btohqsg
Yes but cannot drive in sg unless u get approval from LTA,btohqsg
you  absolutely cannot drive a malaysian car in singapore whether true sinkie or PR,btohqsg
but anyone can buy a malaysian car to driver in malaysia,btohqsg
Haha joke:) cos your nick is X and u showed a mark X ‚Ä¶ just a joke ok.. no offense,btohqsg
oh i see. haha what a coincidence,btohqsg
japan culture i hear that commands highest respect,btohqsg
Yes this true‚Ä¶. But I heard some pple have work permits in Malaysia and can get ‚Äúapproval‚Äù ‚Ä¶. I got fined before for driving a Malaysia üá≤üáæ registered car 3 decades ago‚Ä¶ $800,btohqsg
Yes very good car‚Ä¶. First cousin of IS250,btohqsg
Don't know whether anyone else caught on to that reference,btohqsg
nope this is incorrect. I personally know a singaporean living in msia (he has business there) who is approved via letter from LTA to drive a malaysian car in singapore,btohqsg
he is singapore citizen born and raised  and is not even malaysian PR,btohqsg
That‚Äôs special situation. Did you ask why he got LTA letter? Try getting one yourself and see if you get it,btohqsg
you said it was impossible. im just saying its not impossible. and he got the letter because he spends 99% of his time in msia and therefore does not need to buy a singapore car. he wrote a letter to LTA and with a few supporting documents  they approved him. anything else?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs special situation. He spends abs does business in Malaysia. And with written permission this is outlier.,btohqsg
what you just said is inconsistent with your earlier statement,btohqsg
i am pointing out your earlier statement is factually incorrect. There was no mention of special circumstances,btohqsg
I have friends who spend a lot of time in Malaysia  owning Malaysia car but cannot drive to singapore. He‚Äôs to park the car in malaysia and then take a bus to singapore,btohqsg
yes this applies to most people who own property in msia but work or spend significant time in singapore,btohqsg
Geez you‚Äôre pointing to technicality here. So my statement doesn‚Äôt not preclude special conditions like disabled car ownership which they may allow. You don‚Äôt have to be so exact. There are many Singaporeans who live in Malaysia and commute daily to singapore. They absolutely cannot use malaysian car to get in and out,btohqsg
er...i am just taking your words as they are. i think most people want to be taken literally. if i choose to interpret your words suka suka  undesirable outcomes can result,btohqsg
This sinkie friend spends 2 years or more in Malaysia. Yet he cannot drive his malaysian car in singapore.,btohqsg
He likes Malaysia. But doesn‚Äôt mind,btohqsg
so if you want to say singaporeans absolutely cannot drive msian cars in singapore  that is a clear statement with clear meaning. perhaps i can suggest being more clear in your wording next time. just saying,btohqsg
You‚Äôre being technical here. Outliers are special circumstances not counted. What counts is majority for people like you and me.,btohqsg
i think in future you should add this to your original statement then>>> you  absolutely cannot drive a malaysian car in singapore whether true sinkie or PR,btohqsg
I‚Äôve lots of sinkies living in Jb. They buy malaysian cars. But can‚Äôt drive back.,btohqsg
i happily would agree with that,btohqsg
so now down to personal attacks? why not just be magnanimous and agree your wording at the onset wasnt correct?,btohqsg
you're not looking very good here you know  and others are watching you,btohqsg
That‚Äôs not attack. You‚Äôre just being difficult pointing out minor details,btohqsg
you  absolutely cannot drive a malaysian car in singapore whether true sinkie or PR,btohqsg
And don‚Äôt playing with words here,btohqsg
and when i point out it is false. you lose your cool,btohqsg
then your english is even worse than your logic,btohqsg
anyway  anyone reading this knows the deal. no need to harp on it,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt lose my cool. You‚Äôre losing it because you like to special situations for which I don‚Äôt mention. Why be so perfect?,btohqsg
its not being perfect. its being correct,btohqsg
