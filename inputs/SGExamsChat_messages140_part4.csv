I once had a ridiculous topic (at least for me). I spoke very little but still passed. Although my overall grade was affected. The rest of my class got an easier and orthodox question. Unfair but this is part and parcel of life,btohqsg
The new sports centre that replaced Singapore indoor stadium. I have never been there  don't know anything about it and I just spoke a sentence.I was so scared and the examiners asked me to drink some water,btohqsg
It was something along the lines of ÊàëÂë®Êú´Ë∑üÊúãÂèãÂéªÈÇ£ÈáåÔºàthe name of the placeÔºâÊâìÁØÆÁêÉ„ÄÇI have zero idea about it,btohqsg
As my name was at the top of the list for my class alphabetically  the rest of the class received a super easy question about text messages and mobile phones,btohqsg
After that the examiner asked  ‰Ω†ÊúâÊ≤°ÊúâÂéªËøáÈÇ£Èáå,btohqsg
she try make your day brighter ahaha,btohqsg
The first part about some reading was okay,btohqsg
Maybe I passed the first part and the second was a utter failure,btohqsg
I don't play sports  that's the thing,btohqsg
i like dancing although im a guy i feel that i'll enjoy dancing because very sexy,btohqsg
Anyways  the other parts helped me pull everything up,btohqsg
If not for this oral it would probably be an A.Whatever  A level H1 Chinese is pretty useless,btohqsg
is it possible for mother tongue moderation to be 45/100 for a C6? Given i heard this year's cohort did shit,btohqsg
i sit back  relax  close my eyes and never wake up anymore,btohqsg
help me collect paper  my maid will send u sch address,btohqsg
Just note that ur oral and LC marks are fixed. There will only be moderation for P1 and P2.,btohqsg
is moderation fixed before exam day or after they see cohort's result for example mother tongur,btohqsg
They base it more on the difficulty only not rly on the cohort,btohqsg
Dun make sense to adjust the A to damn Low if the cohort do damn bad,btohqsg
At that point the cohort dun deserve a lot of A,btohqsg
job so hard to find rn,btohqsg
2020 grads took one for the team,btohqsg
Can I report to a school if the students like keep hogging the place even when the staff tell them not to? Context : they just buy a drink and sit at there and study. Many ppl just want to find seats and to eat but they couldn't find any space because the students have their books scattered everywhere and even littered the floor with the foolscap papers. The staffs actually told them nicely twice and they just said 'We are still dining don't chase us away and not for us you don't have salary'.,btohqsg
The school will likely do an announcement to all students,btohqsg
you definitely can; my school occasionally has the principal call us all on ms teams to speak sadly at us whenever 'members of the public' complain about shit,btohqsg
Anywaydining don't chase us away and not for us you don't have salarydefinitely sounds rude,btohqsg
But if you can live and let live,btohqsg
i wanna know which school ;n;,btohqsg
ist studying at cafe normal unless they tell u away,btohqsg
or they told them away and they dont wanna leave,btohqsg
one time i rlly no choice cuz everywhere to study is choped  i chose a diner w nobody at all  asked if can study there  got permission  bought 3 drinks for just myself and to keep the business going  and studied there,btohqsg
but i guess this is a very diff case,btohqsg
that's fine; but in this case they were just hogging space lol,btohqsg
use ur best judgement and it'll be fine lol,btohqsg
Its kfc macs and burger king,btohqsg
