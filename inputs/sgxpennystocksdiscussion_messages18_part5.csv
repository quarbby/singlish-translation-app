Procurri:been observing last coupla weeks px action (30-33c...with very little exchange at 30-31)..  I get the sense someone is accumulating it... and slowly paying up from 30c to 32-33c to gobble up 250-300k.... then Paul Simon styled 'slip-sliding' takes place agn to 30c... and again another gobble up like today,btohqsg

looked back on company updates and previous results. some key figures to note,btohqsg
then the update on 15 april,btohqsg
next update 2 weeks later to hype market,btohqsg
piping business account for around 40% of revenue previously. smaller portion in coming results so is dependent on MDS to fill the piping holesurely MDS will be the key driver in coming result. the share price is up multifolds from low and retraced to current levels which is still a multibagger albeit smaller oneend of the day  they are a manufacturer. due to urgency of customers of coz they can command a higher premium but compared to companies such as top gloves who deal with external customers directly and self-manufacture  they are just a value add component who will not enjoy the exponential ASP of the products but just a fractioni have no doubts their results will outperform previous half and likely a dividend awaits (once piping biz loss is filled).no idea on capacity of forefront medicals anyway  even if they run 24/7 and social distancing effect  whats their capacity...top gloves has shown how expectations can be a scary thing. can make billions and got dumped  leaving many retails scratching heads why got selldown despite a good result,btohqsg
