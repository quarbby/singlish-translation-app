a car that makes you smile every time you get into and make you look at it again and again is the right choice,btohqsg

Just went to see Mazda 3 and CX-30. Very tempted to change car. Salesperson at counter asked why am I here and I told him I’m looking at cars. He asked if I need help  I said is ok looking around and he went back to his counter seat. I guess now is a seller market. 😂😂😂Tempted to get the Mazda 3,btohqsg

No complains with Mazda 3 really. The new facelift win all non conti car at cat A level in terms of interior.,btohqsg
dont deny .. i went to the showroom and tried it out earlier ... very premium feel .. though the info panel and speedometer a bit outdated feel,btohqsg
My only complain is.. I prefer touch screen for the infotainment display so yeah,btohqsg
GetGo many Mazda 3 to test drive at night 🤭😅👍,btohqsg
Old one.Test drive first. Boom 1hrTest The gearbox. Steering. Turning.New one only interior and facelift.Other should be same.Engine. Etc,btohqsg
My friend Mazda 5. 2 000cc5-6 yr oldCan clock 11-12km/ litre. Good FC already. Should see Honda Odyssey 😅,btohqsg
New one is a mild hybrid,btohqsg
I know Mazda 3 have Hybrid model. Battery + petrolAnd diesel model.I'm confused. Mild Hybrid has battery and electric motor?,btohqsg
as the name suggests  the Mazda 3 is a mild hybrid. A small lithium-ion battery drives a motor generator that produces extra torque and power. This is primarily used to help the car accelerate slightly more quickly from a standstill. However  note that the Mazda is not a pure hybrid car (like a Toyota Prius)  and it is unable to run on battery power alone.,btohqsg
too small power for the body,btohqsg
this is not good enough. my dec 2015 mazda 6 2.5 can do 13 km a liter average,btohqsg
get this mazda 3 hatchback. pretty,btohqsg
Good morning  any bro knows how those car auction works?,btohqsg
For comparison  my 51 year old beetle averages 10.5km/L.Next time on NShighway I will check again  very confident it is more fuel efficient on expressway,btohqsg
thats very good FC for a senior,btohqsg
First time on the Staria. Beautiful vehicle 👍🏼,btohqsg
any small cc car is sufficient on our highway,btohqsg
Hi all anybody got gd driving instructor to recommend,btohqsg
