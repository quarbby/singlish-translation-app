Hello  can I check if it's true that at point of application  there will be a question on whether the applicant is married?,btohqsg
For context  I applied for HFE with my fianc√© last year and got married recently. The HFE will be expiring in Mar 25. Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
I was advised by an HDB officer that we can declare during application so just wondering if it is true,btohqsg
If u are married then u need to submit or show the marriage certificate,btohqsg
Just wait for your appointment to come when u apply for the new Launch,btohqsg
If u can get a Q numberGood luck,btohqsg
I submitted my marriage cert via MyDoc@HDB and called the HDB hotline thereafter. I was told that I don't have to submit the marriage cert  and we can just declare married at point of application,btohqsg
Ok then good luck in your application,btohqsg
Hi  regarding the HFE application  are they only looking for payslip for full-time work or can we include part-time/freelance income as well? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
EverythingCPF statement  payslip will be requiredHDB will ask for it if your number don't add up,btohqsg

ChatGPT:HDB‚Äôs February BTO launches typically occur in the first half of the month  often between6th to 12th February  based on past trends. For 2025  the launch is likely to fall within this range  assuming no changes to HDB‚Äôs usual schedule.,btohqsg
For those who have been involved in the Bayshore conflict since CNY  this is NOT the place to have your tit for tat. Please consider other applicants who have genuine BTO queries and cease this.You are all adults so please show some grace to each other. Not every response requires a reaction or further response.,btohqsg

To reiterate  this is not the place to fight. Nor are the personal attacks and tone acceptable.,btohqsg
Bayshore Vista - 72k to 340kBayshore Palms - 67k to 326kKembangan Wave - 64k to 285k,btohqsg

Good morning  may I know the latest hdb home loan fix rates for ocbc dbs and uob?,btohqsg
wait till hdb map services is updated to show the blocks then it means launching in few days time,btohqsg
im kinda hoping its by next week. Then if there is Bayshore part 2 info for June  I can take that into account for Bayshore unit selection,btohqsg
assuming that there even is anymore bayshore launches this year,btohqsg
Wait for HDB to announce the release.,btohqsg
Meanwhile you may join the SBF group here:https://t.me/sghdbsbf,btohqsg
oh didnt know have a group,btohqsg
Hi  for selection of flats  is it fastest fingers first?Lets say 10 applicants scheduled for appointment on same day. All 10 want a particular floor and unit number.Does it means the 1st person scheduled for that day get to choose that floor and unit number first and not worry if the other 9 get to choose it? Thanks.,btohqsg
Nope. It‚Äôs in order of queue number,btohqsg
Say you are #10 but #9 is taking longer than expected choosing their unit at the counter next to you. They won‚Äôt let you select a unit until 9 is complete,btohqsg
But usually the unit is booked at the very start of each persons  appointment so that it can be more efficient,btohqsg
Typically how long a queue number is given to make a decision before the next number gets to choose?,btohqsg
If the person is really having no clue on what to select and it‚Äôs taking a long time then they might pass it on to the next person and tell the person to come again later in the day,btohqsg
Or would need to be someone completely clueless,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why before all the paperwork and stuff they ask for the unit so this can be handled at the start and not cause disruption,btohqsg
Usually because some paperwork issue might drag longer,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why a lot of people have to wait 1-2 hours past their scheduled appointment slot,btohqsg
Because of those ppl taking so long,btohqsg
Ok; because i could imagine the 1st person in front taking their own sweet time and drag the actual appointment timing of those behind for the day.,btohqsg
Yeah and the effect will snowball if everyone takes long,btohqsg
Can happen but won‚Äôt affect your turn in the q to select,btohqsg
Then I give you permission to go beat them,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know for MCPS  is it okay if only one parent is present for the video call?,btohqsg
