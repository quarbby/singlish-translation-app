Vividthree Announces a Capital Increase of S$2.2million Through Placement of 37 500 000 shares at $0.05832https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/0D22W7L8TULXC109/691562_VV3_Annt_Proposed%20Placement.pdf,btohqsg
50% to finance acquisition and 50% for funding new projects,btohqsg
Managing Director of Vividthree  Mr Charles Yeo  said  “I am pleased that we were able to attract new institutional and high-net-worth investors to drive our M&A and growth strategies. The capital contribution provides us with an improved agility to capitalise on the numerous growth opportunities in front of us  such as the NFTs market  as well as to help strengthen the investments in the organic development of the company.We have a few exciting projects and acquisitions which will allow us to further develop our monetisation strategies.”,btohqsg
NFT project  timely  I believe might have big gap up on Monday to play catch up SMI NFT rally,btohqsg
I am thinking sinjia land big move today  is it related to her CEO taking placement for vv3?,btohqsg
I am a sexy boy ..,btohqsg
Asdew acquisition owned by Alan Wang &  Oxley Ching I see,btohqsg
I personally like this statement  means the acquisition and new projects are already in placed or in advance stage  now is just need capital which they have gathered from this private placement,btohqsg
Same placees from huationg at $00982,btohqsg
Who goes around calling themselves oppa,btohqsg
That throw down and then push up...,btohqsg
Someone mentioned they took huationg placement and dumped. I just checkedJinxin took 9m placement  sold 3mChua weixiong took 9m placement  sold 2.848m shareBoth of them are still holding. Most likely both sell share to raise fund to take placement for vividthree?,btohqsg
Nov 2  proposed placements and also share lending,btohqsg
They lend share to “someone”  to sell FIRST,btohqsg
Placement only completed in nov 15  which means the “share lending borrowers”  now got the shares “to return”,btohqsg
You need to pay first to get shares. This halt lasted 3 days  most likely one or two placee needs to raise fund,btohqsg
Or u can do ipo or placement financing from your broker too,btohqsg
So this time round for vv3  there is no share lending arrangement,btohqsg
Vv3 - with the Upcoming NFT collaboration will be a good enough catalyst.The players loaded alot already . This one   those holding all should win. I shout a lot when below 5c too.,btohqsg

Thanks for your in-depth analysis on Vividthree  nice work there.,btohqsg
A lot of pennies after distributed can doze of slowly and then finally goes into complete sleep. The sleep can last for many yrs.  Can one wait?,btohqsg
Some doze off but can wake up sometime for a short while cos their ultimate aim is to go complete sleep.Becos their float is so huge thay they need time to distribute.So must take note.,btohqsg
Oceanus really dying. Churn a lot 39-41 many new retailer stuck there,btohqsg
Now vivid3 based $0.059.Honestly I think this one big big potential.,btohqsg
The chart is as clear as daylight! Thanks. I personally did not sell at the high hoping that it would reach $1 and my EP was low...,btohqsg
Yes. Don't base on hear say.Do some counting.May comparision.At 8c the market cap is near 2b.Project earning per share (eps) yourself.Ask yourself can meh.In SG market   investor very stingy one. Don't pay dividend one they won't value so high.,btohqsg
True. I no longer vested - sold off with much lesser proft. What is not mine is not mine. Your chart clearly can see the distribution by bbs. In terms of FA  you are right - overpriced.,btohqsg
Lower lows and trading below all MAs and MACD also pretty bad.,btohqsg
Anyway it's penny stock. Will move when BB decide,btohqsg
Indicators/charts are drawn by the BB anyway,btohqsg
I believe ysday many shortists got caught shorting sinjia even at opening gap up,btohqsg
“Few exciting projects and acquisitions  to further develop our monetisation strategies”I agree with you  many key words here to support your views of big big potential,btohqsg
Ray of liteWhat are your views about ICG (KUO)?,btohqsg
Fully agree 👍 bro Sam. Am just sharing cos I was vested before and rode all the way up but did not cash out then. And Bro Ray of Light rightfully pointed out the distribution by BBs so clearly. And looking at current chart  looks like Bb out? Wait for next group of Bb to come in? Possible or not. Anybody's guess. Too much of a heavyweight for me.,btohqsg
This one I got analysis before.From penny with no fa become fa    once penny turns into Fundemental wth profit   it will be subjected to market valuation.(Speculation phase)U see during penny it rally with their prospect and future earning to a high of 0.09+.(Valuation phase)Then when it slowly churn in profit.  Take it they can earn 20mEPs 20/5734 is 0.0034X10-12 pe is about 3.4 to 4cAnd when shows they can earn more and give dividend  market will then re rate again.,btohqsg
Thks for sharing.. indeed  BB trap 🪤 retailers and ourself exit liao.. next BB otw🤣,btohqsg
Not sure still can buy or not,btohqsg
Not sure can still trust or not,btohqsg

Matex recent MOU updates on disposal of their wholly owned subsidiary stated that the purchaser added an additional 1m RMB deposit to get a 3 months purchase exclusivity whilst they continue their Due Diligence.Note that this MOU was signed on the 26th Aug 2021.Meaning to say that the 3 months exclusivity will end on the 26th Nov 2021 (this week friday)We should be expecting some action whether the 50m RMB purchase deal  finalises or not. Reason being Matex share price clearly have not factored in any run up and with the recent rights issue at $0.027 being the psychological base   the risk reward here can be pretty amazing.Let’s see how this one unfolds.The recent PA looks positive to me  feels like some early accumulation already by some players and if so  4 series should be an easy reach,btohqsg

These bigger volume spike green candles with small red candles that followed looks like someone have have accumulating and flushing out the weaker hands.For example  3rd Nov  there was 16.9mil volume on this T where it touched 35 and closed 32. On this T+4  we do not see much selling but yet price touched 29. Looks to me like a last attempt to flush out more hands before they begin the games.Sit tight on this once  I believe it’s time is near since this Friday is the end of the 3 month exclusivity on this purchase deal.DYODD,btohqsg
Hope it come soon  been waiting a long time already...lol,btohqsg
If deal goes through  can be big this one . This week   we should be getting some updates.Hope for the best.Few possible outcomes- Deal is finalised and purchase will proceed- pay another 1m RMB for more time exclusivity- Deal call off.Based on the the recent PA as per chart above. Looks more like accumulation.I believe news always leaks and the players should have accumulated already,btohqsg
Going to rocket  accumulate so much I think going to break 44 and go toward 50 series,btohqsg
their pr skill very up there one  don't even try,btohqsg

Updates on CSC ($0.014/$0.015)- sellers at 14 drying up.- T+4 over on Friday. (T was 14 mil volume and 1.6m on T+4) this means high chance the player is who bought holding this oneHigh chance this week they will test 15 and break it . Let’s see.14 will be the safe play though  best to collect here still . Maybe a last flush to shake some retailers before they push.DYODD,btohqsg
