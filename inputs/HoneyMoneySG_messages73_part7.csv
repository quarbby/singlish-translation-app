Hello  noob question here üòÖ I have invested in Philips Smart Portfolio $400 and I‚Äôm currently seeing the account value to be $703.01. Is this going to be increased over time or will fluctuate?,btohqsg
Can I check for hospital bill  will I get 10x reward for citi reward card if paired with amaze?,btohqsg
Wahhh when you start the investment? Grew a lot,btohqsg
Oh Okok .. thanks I remember there‚Äôs dividends reinvest for this that‚Äôs why I opened an Acc to start learning how to invest then over 1 year now become $700 I‚Äôm shocked,btohqsg
I opened last year   I was abit shock too,btohqsg
Probably that‚Äôs why + capital gains.,btohqsg
Is your Phillip Smart Portfolio the Growth or US Equity portfolio?,btohqsg
According to Phillips smart portfolio website  as of 30 Sep 2023  the performance is not that high. ü§î,btohqsg
Not sure how to see üòÖ,btohqsg
But now the value is $716.68,btohqsg
But so weird  log in their website the value is 393.11 whereas the app states value at $716.68 .. confusing,btohqsg
Account value 703 is not the same as Portfolio value 393. Is there idle cash around 300 in your account that is not invested in the smart portfolio?,btohqsg
yes  for max $1k in statement month. Will incur 1% Amaze fee,btohqsg
Hi guys is the webull moneybull promo still on ? I can't find it in my promotion center,btohqsg
üßê Okok maybe I should call up their CS and try to find out is there $300 not invested as I‚Äôm clueless üòÖ thanks btw !!,btohqsg
1% fee is due to the latest changes in amaze as category is hospital right,btohqsg

Hi anyone have any lobang on car loans? What would be the best way to repay it and anything to take note when taking one?,btohqsg

hey guys  for UOB lady's card  does paying for gym membership count in the beauty and wellness category?i see UOB mentions fitness centres on their site but then i don't see the MCC (7941).,btohqsg
For uob Xmas promotion  can I participate in both uob stash and uob one?  Also  is it better to have $100k in each account or focus in just 1 account with $200k?  Thks,btohqsg
Hi for home appliances  one shot 8 9k kind  which credit card is the best to use? See a lot of the cards have a limit on the rewards once hit 1k.,btohqsg
Just used XNAP for my wet market purchases ü•∞ not sure if it counted as food under lady‚Äôs card so I used uob ppv,btohqsg
cashback for one account only. Max interest for $100k average daily balance on uob one account,btohqsg
U can link to amaze then check it afterwards,btohqsg
Can I check  are we able to withdraw the excess of 100k during the earmarked period? Or should we just leave it there and not touch it? Because there will be 400+ interest every month so that will exceed 100k,btohqsg
how come there is excess? did not empty account on 30 Sep?,btohqsg
Doubt so  usually grab voucher can only use for food/ mart/ transport,btohqsg
I did empty. There was 0 until November  when I put in funds. But once I put 100k in November  then I will get 400+ cos of the 5% interest,btohqsg
Based on previous promos  as long as your daily balance is at least 100k + the end of day balance on 30 Sep  any excess withdrawn (like interest earned) is okay,btohqsg
Can 2 different amaze card link to 1 same Mastercard?,btohqsg

How come they don't accept Mastercard?,btohqsg

Yes  4131 is not Travel excluded  you may refer to crmc t&c,btohqsg
My bro tried trsf but he said doesn't work,btohqsg
Anyone knows why I see a transaction on my Instarem saying Instarem fee of 0.50?,btohqsg

USD digital rate for iChange not good leh. Currently showing 1.357 which is higher than interbank rate 1.3544I think i use credit card with cashback overseas get better rate,btohqsg
Think cannot assume one agent give better rates for all currencies  likely to be uneven across agents/cards,btohqsg
Wow $400 become $700++  how long you put,btohqsg
