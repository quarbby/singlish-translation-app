"Collected AP Stategic A.K.A Asia Pacific Strategic Investments at $0.002. I reckon this is the base. Decent volume and hidden buyers at $0.002.- Oei Hong Leong as controlling shareholder at more than 35% of this company- Yesterday announced a non-binding proposed property disposal. If it goes through  will net them over 35 mil Sgd.Looking at all angles  this one although have sellers at $0.002  does not look like a trap to me. It is very similar to DiSa before their run.DYODD. All should keep this one in watchlist.The recent DiSa run  many won 5-6 figures profit easily. Those missed on DiSa  can consider to bank on this one.""You might have missed once  but never miss twice""However  do take note  you will need to buy up this one. Hence  collect $0.002 only for now.DYODD#allyouneedis1counter#OeiHongLeong#potentialmultibagger",btohqsg

Back then when Billionaire OHL (Oei Hong Leong) Took control of 'APS' (AP Strategic) at mainly $0.003.
