Thanks Chris. I did find a more concise (article friendly) table which you could use in your articles. If you need higher resolution one it is somewhere in one of the FAQ answers.,btohqsg
I just find it lame they don't have a proper and official PDF TNC that we usually get from Banks.,btohqsg
Includes FlashPay top up under Transport category hmmmmm,btohqsg
let's see how long this can last.. LOL,btohqsg
last week ive used Citi rewards +Amaze at 7eleven 5499   NTUC (5411) & Sheng Shiong but didn't earn 4mpd  the transaction is confirmed  does citi need more time to credit the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi all any bros familiar with SRS contributions? If I put in say 15k today and tomorrow I invest it. Am I still eligible for tax relief?Thank you.,btohqsg
as in u using amaze card(linked with citi rewards card) and there is no 10x thank you points awarded,btohqsg
Just wondering how the cashback mechanism works. If I spent $1 on dining (which is my preferred category) and remaining $1999 on other category  does that mean I get $250+ ($1999*1%*3mths)? (Assume existing trust customer),btohqsg
eligible for tax relief once contributed,btohqsg
This table confuses me. I can get $65 if I add up 945 and 500 and multiply by 3 mths. That's why it looks odd,btohqsg
yup correct  i used Amazed thats link with CRM,btohqsg
555Ã—15%Ã—3=249.75(945+500)Ã—1.5%Ã—3=65500Ã—20%Ã—3=300(but become 169 due to caps),btohqsg
The 4mpd is not credited separately. Once the txn posts it should credit the base and bonus pts,btohqsg
I think they didn't make it clear enough that the $250 bonus cashback is assuming you MAXED out the 15% category.That means $555 x 3 x 15% = $249.75Doesn't mean you hit $2k total spend per month for 3 months  by only spending $10 on Bonus Categories mean you will still get the $250 bonus cashback,btohqsg
(per month)Preferred category: $1 x 15% = $0.15Everything else: $1999 x 1% = $19.99,btohqsg
thanks everyone. very helpful for the breakdown,btohqsg
anyone paid for maybank auto loan before?,btohqsg
Does the new cashback trust credit card earn link points too?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  can someone share their experience buying voucher from Heymax to clock their outstanding CC spend target? I bought it last night  hope i am in time for this month. May I know generally how many days it take to post?,btohqsg
No. I assumed you have to earn the points through NTUC FairPrice app. Similarly benefits like rebate is meant for NTUC trust card only,btohqsg
the trust card cashback rate isnt trustworthy at all,btohqsg
combined many aspects uob products. UOB one quarter  UOB lady categories and now UOB EVO cashback logic.,btohqsg
i say under 1 month  and the problem is you can only change category once a quarter  so i weigh weigh. nahhh i need the Dining category more,btohqsg
ya might as well put 500% cashback rate with cashback cap at $250 and minimum spend of $2000 per month right? ðŸ˜‚ fake 15%,btohqsg
Trust is terrible man. I had a failed atm transaction 1 mth ago in rio  and they hv not refunded my money. $300 gone.,btohqsg
Bonus cashback capped at $250 per quarter? The normal 1% no capped right?,btohqsg
Favepay usually takes one day to post. If direct credit card use  2-3 days.,btohqsg
Genuine question  why donâ€™t people put their idle cash in UOB Stash for 5%p.a? Seems like thereâ€™s no lock in  SDIC covered  no spend required. Just purely maintain or increase monthly average balance any downside/opportunity cost to look out for?,btohqsg
Cuz it's effective 3% pa without promo.,btohqsg
may i know which card is good to pay for bills in healthhub?,btohqsg
for citi rewards need to link with amaze or just the card?,btohqsg
Use with amaze safer  cause you can check the MCC (i.e. 8099) of the transaction. Some have reported that the MCCs can be different.,btohqsg
any recommendations for big ticket/uncapped spending to earn miles? apart from UOB krisflyer.,btohqsg
u better hurry.... Amaze + UOB KF might be killed off soon,btohqsg
but normally the payment will just go thru right?,btohqsg
how to check mcc if like this,btohqsg
Link to empty wallet  transaction will be declined. Then you can check MCC of the declined transaction.,btohqsg
Hey folks  do you know if hospital fee charged overseas has the same MCC?,btohqsg
eh... how u expect us to know which hospital you referring to?anyway it is always best to TEST the new merchant's MCC with amaze + empty wallet before you pay,btohqsg
sigh that being said.. i cannot imagine life without Amaze now that we have been spoilt with Amaze + empty wallet testing method,btohqsg
Hi  May I ask if anyone is taking SIA first class return flight to Singapore and accessing the lounge after landing.Will the bags be taken care and put at lost & found automatically?,btohqsg
