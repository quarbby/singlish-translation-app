H2G Green getting more and more stable. $0.024 sellers seems to have dried up. Hence Buy call $0.024 for now. Until then. I think Matex upcoming run should startle and wake this one up,btohqsg

Oxpay Financial touched $0.142 which is a key line to bounce.They have flushed the hell out of many and artificially suppressed this one to hit this support level.Last time round when it hit here  they bounced  real fast and good to $0.19x.Hence  $0.170 should be an achievable and realistic target.Furthermore  their recent financials announced is profitable too.About time to move. DYODD,btohqsg
