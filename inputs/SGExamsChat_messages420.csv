Why do ppl work at Mac,btohqsg
it's like thumbdrives. There is a part where it is powered on or off. That part spoils the fastest,btohqsg
A NAS with RAID has redundancy,btohqsg
and it will not be $2800. Last 20 years?,btohqsg
I only had one HDD fail every 3-4 years or so  and that is with 24/7 turned on,btohqsg
why do people even like her,btohqsg
I had 2 HDDs failed at the same time once,btohqsg
computer nerd shit being talked about,btohqsg
What's a good NAS with raid.,btohqsg
There were under warranty  so I managed to exchange. The guy told me it was very common,btohqsg
he thought I dropped the NAS  which I didn't. They just failed with bad sectors,btohqsg
I was lucky I backed up with an additional external HDD on top of the NAS,btohqsg
Bad sectors alone don't cause failure,btohqsg
A lot of it for some reason,btohqsg
When I mean fail I mean that the HDD is totally gone,btohqsg
Not detected at all by the system,btohqsg
and worse  it happened just before CNY,btohqsg
Almost that already. Some files can't be read,btohqsg
can detect  but can't copy out,btohqsg
I've 2 HDD  not detected at all. The USB connection is gone. Bad sector's hdd can still be accessed and backed up.,btohqsg
Cheaper version than Google drive:pCloud lifetime deal.,btohqsg
$350 euros  2TB for 99 years or when the company goes bankrupt,btohqsg
End up  I subscribed to Google cloud for 1 year. Thinking of longer term solution.,btohqsg
it's ok you building plane not computer,btohqsg
My most important data backed up to NAS  and few cloud storage.Google Drive  pCloud and IceDrive,btohqsg
i build yours just don't tell u,btohqsg
Ik LOL nows not the time,btohqsg
depends on how important you treat your data,btohqsg
As a girl I dont understand guys,btohqsg
Hahaha. It isn't when your data is totally gone. Like legit pictures 10 years ago.,btohqsg
Any data loss on my lesson materials is a big blow. I spent 10 years+ on them,btohqsg
tbh maybe that's good. i'd rather die in blissful ignorance,btohqsg
as a guy  i don't understand guys either,btohqsg
why do you have someones backs as wallpaper,btohqsg
Invest in a good antivirus as well,btohqsg
Windows Defender has been proven to be sufficiently good,btohqsg
BUT HE IS MY GAMIN IDOL LOL,btohqsg
Anti virus don't cheapskate go install enterprise version.,btohqsg
End up wanna uninstall cannot. Cuz need their pw.,btohqsg
ok trust me  the more you learn  the less straightforward or logical it gets LOL,btohqsg
that's why everything backed up. Ransom ware  I just change a new comp,btohqsg
Although it has improved a lot,btohqsg
ever since the before CNY incident that both HDDs can fail  I got multiple backups,btohqsg
don't go to the dark side,btohqsg
Nice  make sure to air gap them,btohqsg
When I have more budget  I will do chain NAS. Use NAS to backup NAS,btohqsg
y ur replies so dry bro,btohqsg
side note but my friend sent this to me,btohqsg
Any resemblance to real persons  living or dead  is purely coincidental.,btohqsg
Guys where can i buy boujee clothes,btohqsg
i can't tell if you're 4  9 or 16,btohqsg
The definition of boujee is relative.,btohqsg
Poly halfway dropout in the words of Ah Yoke from Kin.,btohqsg
Relative to ? Unless you mean â€˜subjectiveâ€™.,btohqsg
Its not  its insufficient to run ps.,btohqsg
U snipping me q again isit,btohqsg
I cant even google this HAHAHA,btohqsg
Everyone that I know says that its horrendous,btohqsg
How would you even run ps on the cloud,btohqsg
Ew whoâ€™s that in the background picture,btohqsg
but my point was everything can be done on the cloud,btohqsg
so why spend more on hardware,btohqsg
Another Dropbox Google Drive OneDrive alternative,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t that just a external hard disk,btohqsg
Guys. I need a timetable for the whole of December. Any steps to make an effective one?,btohqsg
I would show mine but mine is hell,btohqsg
Donâ€™t make one if you donâ€™t know how much youâ€™ve to study.,btohqsg
"I'm like going to year 3 so I'm kinda worried ill sort of lose touch on ""how"" to study ðŸ’€",btohqsg
Ok my timetable only for sch n work ngl,btohqsg
OneDrive is stable. Stability and longevity is more important for data,btohqsg
Just study. How likely are you to follow a timetable that is not issued to you by the school  really?,btohqsg
I am surprised if they fully follow through.,btohqsg
I donâ€™t look for memes on YouTube.,btohqsg
Sec 3 this year or next year,btohqsg
We do it's just not for the holiday period,btohqsg
Prepare for the intense work jump,btohqsg
But adapt it for the holidays,btohqsg
Do you have your materials yet,btohqsg
Not yet. Getting them in 3 days,btohqsg
Have some books might be out of syllabus though,btohqsg
Pro tip â€” just figure out the content from your o level syllabus and plan accordingly,btohqsg
The syllabus doc on the topics tested from SEAB.,btohqsg
No I don't take O levels,btohqsg
I'm scared I'm gonna fumble the bad next year,btohqsg
Hi people i just woke up,btohqsg
A level period = messed up sleep schedule,btohqsg
A pretty commonly shared sentiment tbh. IP is mad goofy when u compare it to JC stuff,btohqsg
I legit am scared for this,btohqsg
What do you mean by mad goofy,btohqsg
It's the bane of my existence,btohqsg
what sch are you from if I may ask,btohqsg
Like your foundation is something ur just supposed to pick up on your own. There is barely any structure,btohqsg
Some ip papers are close or already hitting 3h so...should be fine by jc,btohqsg
Do yall even call it Math and A math,btohqsg
Ahh. That's... interesting... because many of my classmates and I didn't feel that. Maybe we too carefree or heck care lol,btohqsg
Math is gonna screw me over,btohqsg
cos my sch when i was there called it Math 1 and Math 2,btohqsg
Ye I hear the term burn out get thrown out pretty often. Wth is it and how do I avoid it ðŸ’€,btohqsg
basically when u r so sick and tired and unmotivated to study,btohqsg
If you take bio then i suggest taking a look at some JCs papers or other IP papers because IP bio  at least for my school  the entire paper is application all application and also have essay questions already,btohqsg
its also when even u revise and put in like alot of time,btohqsg
Me for my past years of education,btohqsg
usu u see this at eoy every year,btohqsg
Aiya chill bro. My IP years like...slack because we knew that we would go JC anyway,btohqsg
like im in o level so,btohqsg
Tbh biggest thing with IP for me was not being prepared for A levels national exam scenario,btohqsg
when my last one was PSLE,btohqsg
well now was since i finished this yr lmao,btohqsg
but ya i no clue how ip is like,btohqsg
Okay this i lowkey agree. I got a bit panicked when A level first started also,btohqsg
By A level  i too used to...taking exams lightlyThen A level feels like any other internal paper,btohqsg
When i was s3 i only look forward to obs and stepping up,btohqsg
the lactic acid accumulation will be so bad its not even funny,btohqsg
can't slack too much  but really you've got time to figure out how to optimize your studying,btohqsg
how did you do for prev years?,btohqsg
dont need to chiong mug 10hrs a day or some nonsense liddat,btohqsg
just figure out what study methods work for u,btohqsg
tbh thats smth i regret not figuring out properly,btohqsg
even the young people here older than you,btohqsg
U learn jap to impress her,btohqsg
but ya la make sure uk ur foundation,btohqsg
But legit  i think best way is to learn from a friend who knows JapaneseThen they know how to guide also,btohqsg
like my best friend  weeb -> minor in Jap -> exchange for uni in Kyoto,btohqsg
ns best time to watch all anime,btohqsg
-> now doing translation for japanese forum,btohqsg
minor in jap without pior exp ah,btohqsg
yea  i mean they teach you from rookie level,btohqsg
If you nit retaking ns is damn good,btohqsg
ok but she's not from sg,btohqsg
in NTU  you can take jap level 1 all the way to like 5 or smth,btohqsg
i see the charas alrd quite scared,btohqsg
why you want learn jap sia,btohqsg
most people take at least one language mod in uni,btohqsg
ok but fr also wanna go to japan in the future,btohqsg
you'll have electives to clear anyway,btohqsg
might as well take a photography or culinary mod,btohqsg
also i salty this series i wanna read no el translation,btohqsg
you think only got 1 elective to clear meh,btohqsg
whats so bad abt learning a new language also,btohqsg
Pick up a class in photoshop better yea,btohqsg
to be fair  Korean is not hard to pick up,btohqsg
just focus on being more fit not cuz of looks tbh,btohqsg
more for living longer and doing more ig,btohqsg
I have no idea how people say kpop idols are fit and handsome,btohqsg
i shall go back to staring at fictional men     ,btohqsg
no srly my anime shrine is so bad my sis wanna flame me alrd,btohqsg
dont go crazy over Aki Denji Toji Gojo,btohqsg
no wonder you've no money for foodie things,btohqsg
pls ah havent even count my dolls  standee    ,btohqsg
how much do you estimate you've spent,btohqsg
But I feel korean girls way better looking than the guys ngl,btohqsg
less money than i've thrown to nintendo,btohqsg
also the guys look slightly girly,btohqsg
no beard or muscles and chiselled features,btohqsg
why get actual therapy when can just buy weeb merch,btohqsg
holy shit I'm not a man,btohqsg
btw since we talked about spending money on things,btohqsg
ok lah assuming yall have ah,btohqsg
I am just joking with yall bro,btohqsg
we went from talking abt idk what we talk abt jn to now pubic hair im intrigued (a joke im not actually intrigued),btohqsg
also im not gonna be a dajie to some random doodeth,btohqsg
or like sleep ah its a nice feeling,btohqsg
and i am still heading home so,btohqsg
I am the low eq dude really. Everytime I come online its about people not getting a gf/bf and wanting to kill themselves.,btohqsg
din know pubic hair equates to people not getting a bf/gf,btohqsg
oh so beards was the transition,btohqsg
would have been funnier if it was eyelashes,btohqsg
pubic hair the top reason for breakups,btohqsg
but ok ah wan my opinion here is dajie opinion theres 2582 peepos here plus minus cuz people jeep coming and going  ranging from kids (sorry pocoyo ur cool n all but yes technically child) to adults and to come in talking abt pubic hair just cuz the active ones at that point in time is older ish people (i assume context cuz i was not there when the bloody convo started) is lowkey dumb cuz  just because youre targetting maybe(?) 2+ people lets say for the qn  the other 2580 people still can see sooooo,btohqsg
"i mean slay i guess ask away? but its pretty normal for someone to give a ""what the fuck"" as a response because yea. you kinda dont go up to a rando irl and ask them ""hey do u have pubes?"" as a joke",btohqsg
so ye there u go can i go now,btohqsg
ðŸ¥¡ said i have smol feet,btohqsg
as much as this can sound normal we just had a pubes talk..,btohqsg
ive been trying to accumulate this over a few days to see if i can break a record,btohqsg
which is why i put a disclaimer,btohqsg
that i don't have a foot kink,btohqsg
a guy who has foot kink would say they dont have a foot kink,btohqsg
a guy who doesn't have a foot kink would also say they don't have a foot kink,btohqsg
"people who ""get off"" to feets",btohqsg
Only heard of fetish but not the kink tho.,btohqsg
