Taxi driver lays the smack down on a lady who dared to kick his Toyota VellfireHow would you react if you were the taxi driver?‚û°Ô∏è React with ü§î if you think both of them should continue fighting at the police station!üëâüèª Read the full storyhere!,btohqsg
How many passengers you want to sit behind?,btohqsg
3 people. But some of the SUVs like GLA is very squeezey,btohqsg
I find they present good value for money proposition,btohqsg
I find that a little small but yes Niro is nice too.,btohqsg
The new version is nice  but 2nd hand only have diesel haha,btohqsg
Yeah  alot of bells and whistles,btohqsg
Have not looked at it yet. Is the size good at the back?,btohqsg
Also quite big  boot space also quite big,btohqsg
nah  he is looking for 2nd hand isn't it,btohqsg
That one is very powerful. Still suck?,btohqsg
having sat between the Kona  Niro and HR-VNiro has the best rear space hands down.However Niro is more of a hatchback ride feel compared to HR-V/Vezel's more prominent SUV so might not fit the bill if you are looking for the SUV feeling,btohqsg
You buy crossover to get the SUV mah. If not you buy estate  stationwagon or hatchback liao,btohqsg
Yeah. Unless first hand cheap enough,btohqsg
Thanks man. Will check it out,btohqsg
I see. Its more for my old parents who sit at the back.,btohqsg
being a honda they should be pretty reliable.See your appetite  since a number of them would have the PHV stickers.,btohqsg

Was look at peugeot suv  Q5 and discovery the other day. Q5 and discovery the depre is  high,btohqsg
I was a car opener once. I even got in sat down and close the door.,btohqsg
Not my vote for value for money  plus maintenance costs may be slightly higher,btohqsg
