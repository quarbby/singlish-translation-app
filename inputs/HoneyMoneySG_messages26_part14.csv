If reward can take the hospital mcc then u use amaze way,btohqsg
capped at 500 instapoints ($500 foreign spend) per transaction. no limit if can split into multiple $500 transactions,btohqsg
For Citibank  they don’t exclude hospital MCC.,btohqsg
Then it is limit to 1k for citi reward then,btohqsg
If the mcc of hospital fall under 9399 citi bank does exclude it,btohqsg
So better to test abit first before paying all,btohqsg
That why it is always mcc not the nature of business that determine,btohqsg
