What's with So many people pming me asking me to join another llm unofficial group with a qt code,btohqsg
It's a sub grp of ex members who got sour after being booted üòÇ,btohqsg
Why did they get booted üòÇ,btohqsg
The member who deserved to be boot is Â§ß‰∫∫...he really think that he is Â§ß‰Ω¨?! So rude & arrogant whenever newbies asked Q.,btohqsg
Sorry to say this. But Ban of boot is for scammer. Sad to say if everytime have to ans newbies question might as well go lalamove do customer service,btohqsg
The whole idea of this group is for people to chat and even  ask questions  be it newbie or not. Yall know customer service for LLM is not immediate. There is no need for discrepancy as such  every one started out new at some point.And on the point of the bot abuse  on top of the complaints I have received from other members  if they are to keep banning themself and to ask me everytime to unban themselves.. I'm gonna be really busy. üòÇHence I do not entertain these silly requests.They have created a new sub group and have been poaching from the channel  members can exercise your own discretion whether to join them.The removal of members earlier since yesterday  are related to the incident and has been placed on a ban indefinitely.As this incident comes to a closure in this grp  Let us move on. üëç,btohqsg
