Hello  can I check for UOB Prvimiles card promo on the expedia booking for 6mpd. The 6mpd only applies to the participating airlines through Expedia? So if I book Scoot through Expedia I will only get the base local spend rate?,btohqsg
Do y‚Äôall recommend the new to bank promo for standchart journey (35k miles) or go for the 400 cashback?,btohqsg
Depends if u like flying or prefer cash. Very personal decision,btohqsg
must be via the specific linkhttps://www.uob.com.sg/uobgroup/url-redirection.page?&pid=PRVIPRSCO&&vid=MindshareSG&s_cid=grm:sg:paid:sea:go:na:tx:na:prvi:010323-evergreen:conversion:brand&reURL=https://expedia.com.sg/prvimiles,btohqsg
Yup I know must be through the link but if not the participating airlines I wouldn‚Äôt get 6mpd?,btohqsg
Assuming I earn 4mpd on that 3k criteria  it‚Äôs a choice between12k miles + 400 dollars38.6k miles + 140 dollarsEssentially means I‚Äôm paying 260ish dollars for 26k miles hahah hmmm  means paying 1c per mile,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what the list is telling u correct?,btohqsg

Hi  I read lots of discussions here on uob credit card to earn cashback.  Would like to know if uob debit card can be a replacement of the credit card ?  I was given a debit card when I opened the uob stash account and considering opening a uob account.  Thus  still trying to understand whether to get a uob credit card.  Thks,btohqsg
can but debit card has less benefits,btohqsg
In terms of cashback?  OK  will get a credit card then.  Thks,btohqsg
yes. uob evol or uob one cc are better for cashback,btohqsg
How do you activate moneybull in webull account?,btohqsg
you can consider uob evol or uob one cc depending on your spending habits,btohqsg
Hi  i used cashback at a restaurant for dining. Most likely wont visit the store again. I recall Chris mentioning in one of his video that i can make a transation of $0.10 to get the cashback pending for my second visit. I would like to know this cashback that i will receive  is it i can only use to offset at the same store? Or this cashback will be credited into my shopback account and i can use the cashback to offset any other transactions?,btohqsg
this one need to read the TNC of the cashbackFrom my experience   is usually only allowed to be used on the same store,btohqsg
Note that higher cashback often comes with minimum spending and more hassle to track your transactions.,btohqsg
Webull cash account there's no more Moneybull. Have to oneself subscribe into MMF. Also no auto sweep facility,btohqsg
Anyone having issue with Bigpay not receiving OTP for payment to merchant?,btohqsg
Hi all  can I check if the Trust credit card has monthly min spend requirement? I'm planning to get it mainly for overseas use only (not really trying to earn the rewards with non overseas expenses) and wanna make sure there's no minimum monthly spend requirement...,btohqsg

Hello I moved to SG recently and I'll need to open a saving account soon  I am considering between OCBC 360 and UOB 1 account.. my criteria and current situations are below:1. Initially for first 6 months my salary is 4.7K SGD then after that move to 6K SGD and quaterly discretionary bonus2. I will be remitting money back to my family (initially during 4.7K salary remit max 2.3K SGD and after 6K upgrade remit max 2.8K SGD p.m)3. I don't need credit card  just normal debit card that can be used for public transport as well (bank debit card should support payment for transport primarily MRT and Bus)4. I prefer digital payment then to keep hoard of cash like last time when I was in sgAnyone kind enough to please give me some advise as per my scenarios.. thank you in advance üôèüèº,btohqsg
1. For uob one account  u need min $500 monthly card spend on selected credit/debit card2. How much balance u have? Interest is higher only if u have close to $100k balance for uob one or ocbc 360 accounts.,btohqsg
Thank for the update  yes#1 my monthly spend will be > $500#2 bonus included my pay will be around or more than 100k SGDWhich one should I chose among uob one or ocbc 360 in this case where my balance criteria is around or more than 100K,btohqsg
1. what kind of contract does when the first 6 months' salary is much lower  is this after probation they pay more?2. why not use credit card as it give more benefits,btohqsg
1. Yes probation period2. It's personal preference  I just like to move away from credit cards and spend only what I have,btohqsg
what is the monthly average bank balance you foresee you will maintain in the bank after remitting out?,btohqsg
after remit and expenses... around 200-300 sgd for first 6 months and then after 6 months  around min 500sgd,btohqsg
if the amount that remains in your bank is around less than $1000 monthly  you can choose any bank that's convenient for you.,btohqsg
I see  so either bank will be around same interest rate if my monthly balance below 1k SGD.. Thanks for the input üôè,btohqsg
yes  if you are open to digital banks  you can consider GXS  MariBank or Trust.,btohqsg
No min balance and no min spend requirement.,btohqsg
Oh yeah also I can use uob or ocbc atm from either of the bank card yeah? I think they support inter-operability?,btohqsg
if you foresee you will use atm often can consider DBS or OCBC. More ATM around the island I think.,btohqsg
for less than $1000 in the bank  don't think UOB one will be much higher. Any of the 3 digital banks will do.,btohqsg
consideration maybe will also depends on how you plan to do the remittance monthly.,btohqsg
but this part I am not familiar so not sure which bank will be better if you need to remit monthly.,btohqsg
