I must make a shrine and pray to si Yan rn,btohqsg

The things U learn from o lvl geog content wise,btohqsg
Is basically useless in a lvl,btohqsg
Ok but I think old sylla alrd sooo,btohqsg
Idk to me  it seems like jc students are not taught enough to do anything Infocomm related…like Coding/Testing unless prior experience in companies  I doubt they can be put through to Infocomm diplomas,btohqsg
Again idk much about the jc curriculum but last I checked  there are no computer applications lessons.Closest is computing  but that teaches you coding languages  does not teach you applications which is a required knowledge in poly if you want to transition mid way through,btohqsg
How does karang guni work does anyone know,btohqsg
Like u give them recycable items isit,btohqsg
You give them your recycled materials  they weigh and give you a Amt based off the weight. They take your items to a warehouse/recycling point/truck and recycling houses/companies would buy off the collected items from them and pay them a price for it,btohqsg
The only thing is the average commoner won’t collect enough weight to sell said items/have no schedule of the trucks/ unviable if you are able bodied and can find work,btohqsg
sec sch students are also not taught anything infocomm related  yet they can go poly do infocomm stuff,btohqsg
Common courses maybe  but if you go into specialisation i doubt it’s possible unless of course you go rp,btohqsg
I rmb my mum used to discard our recycables to the karang guni,btohqsg
Where they practically take anybody at this point,btohqsg
I loved stepping on cans to crush them then we wld have like a whole bag full to give to the uncle karang guni,btohqsg
then whos gonna go to those then,btohqsg

Follows the same concept as applied science  have to get some prior experience first,btohqsg

forgot to clarify it was only for NT students,btohqsg
