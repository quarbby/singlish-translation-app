"Putin already got the commitment from China Xi -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                China and Russia on the opening day of the Winter Olympics declared a ""no limits"" partnership  backing each other over standoffs on Ukraine and Taiwan with a promise to collaborate more against the West.President Xi Jinping hosted President Vladimir Putin on Friday as the two nations said their relationship was superior to any Cold War era alliance and they would work together on space  climate change  artificial intelligence and control of the internet.                                                                                                                                                                                               Beijing supported Russia's demand that Ukraine should not be admitted into NATO  as the Kremlin amasses 100 000 troops near its neighbour  while Moscow opposed any form of independence for Taiwan  as global powers jostle over their spheres of influence.""Friendship between the two States has no limits  there are no 'forbidden' areas of cooperation "" the two countries said in a joint statement.https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-china-tell-nato-stop-expansion-moscow-backs-beijing-taiwan-2022-02-04/",btohqsg
"Absolutely. The Chinese saying goes ""Your enemy's enemy  is your friend""  as as for  now and no one will know what will happen next. Like when US supported Iraq to fight Iran ( Iran–Iraq War)  then  after that US destroyed Iraq (Saddam Hussein) The World game is always the same. There is NO forever enemy and likewise NO forever friend.",btohqsg
Well said... Akin to... There is no share counter to hold forever  and no bad counter to avoid indefinitely.,btohqsg
In fact there is another assumption in regard to the reason why Russia intends to attack Ukraine.https://www.unz.com/mwhitney/the-crisis-in-ukraine-is-not-about-ukraine-its-about-germany/,btohqsg
Washington sees the pipeline as a threat to its primacy in Europe and has tried to sabotage the project at every turn. Even so  Nord Stream has pushed ahead and is now fully-operational and ready-to-go. Once German regulators provide the final certification  the gas deliveries will begin. German homeowners and businesses will have a reliable source of clean and inexpensive energy while Russia will see a significant boost to their gas revenues. It’s a win-win situation for both parties.The US Foreign Policy establishment is not happy about these developments. They don’t want Germany to become more dependent on Russian gas because commerce builds trust and trust leads to the expansion of trade. As relations grow warmer  more trade barriers are lifted  regulations are eased  travel and tourism increase  and a new security architecture evolves. In a world where Germany and Russia are friends and trading partners  there is no need for US military bases  no need for expensive US-made weapons and missile systems  and no need for NATO. There’s also no need to transact energy deals in US Dollars or to stockpile US Treasuries to balance accounts. Transactions between business partners can be conducted in their own currencies which is bound to precipitate a sharp decline in the value of the dollar and a dramatic shift in economic power. This is why the Biden administration opposes Nord Stream. It’s not just a pipeline  it’s a window into the future; a future in which Europe and Asia are drawn closer together into a massive free trade zone that increases their mutual power and prosperity while leaving the US on the outside looking in. Warmer relations between Germany and Russia signal an end to the “unipolar” world order the US has overseen for the last 75 years. A German-Russo alliance threatens to hasten the decline of the Superpower that is presently inching closer to the abyss. This is why Washington is determined to do everything it can to sabotage Nord Stream and keep Germany within its orbit. It’s a matter of survival.That’s where Ukraine comes into the picture. Ukraine is Washington’s ‘weapon of choice’ for torpedoing Nord Stream and putting a wedge between Germany and Russia. The strategy is taken from page one of the US Foreign Policy Handbook under the rubric: Divide and Rule. Washington needs to create the perception that Russia poses a security threat to Europe. That’s the goal. They need to show that Putin is a bloodthirsty aggressor with a hair-trigger temper who cannot be trusted. To that end  the media has been given the assignment of reiterating over and over again  “Russia is planning to invade Ukraine.” What’s left unsaid is that Russia has not invaded any country since the dissolution of the Soviet Union  and that the US has invaded or toppled regimes in more than 50 countries in the same period of time  and that the US maintains over 800 military bases in countries around the world. None of this is reported by the media  instead the focus is on “evil Putin” who has amassed an estimated 100 000 troops along the Ukrainian border threatening to plunge all of Europe into another bloody war.,btohqsg
