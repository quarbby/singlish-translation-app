Does revolut run promotions  like referrals for new users,btohqsg

I have just tried to top up grab wallet using my true cashback card. It still works.,btohqsg
But I can‚Äôt use grabpay to top up my revoult card. And hence not able to top up crypto Visa card,btohqsg
What's the amount you try for me above 2k can't be done. I send out to revolut few amount smaller,btohqsg
Want to invest in S&P500  is S27 okay? Or must buy VOO? Using moomoo.,btohqsg
Something something about US tax and should buy the one in Ireland insteadI'm new to all these too but I think I read some article about it somewhere on seedly...,btohqsg
I also don't know either... I read but never pull trigger üò™,btohqsg
Thanks. S27 is listed on SGX tho  that's why I'm considering it over VOO. Also new to all these  don't really know if what I'm saying makes any sense haha...,btohqsg
Does this mean we can use the UOB Absolute Cashback Card to topup GrabPay card to buy crypto without any fees and get the 1.7% cashback?,btohqsg
You are right  i deleted that msg to avoid confusion,btohqsg
Though i believe going through revolut charged in USD may be better than the SGD spread by Gpmc,btohqsg
Reminder that don't charge Revolut on weekends as they will increase their FX spreads during Sat-Mon 8 am,btohqsg
Can it be done. I am also interested to know the answer.,btohqsg
Morning pple.. how do I get my amaze cashback out,btohqsg
I rmb something along the lines of trf to grabpay...?,btohqsg
Ok I know how already. Change to amaze wallet and then trf to grabpay card,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/aw5HHAjCu5MReferral code: NhkWBHWhy use Instarem Amaze?+ Favorable FX conversion rate+ No DCC Fee+ Add 1% cashback on top of your card rewards+ Tracked as online spending  even if you use the physical card or mobile contactless* Cashback received on 25th calendar day 1 month after calendar quarter* Cashback credited to Amaze wallet  which can be linked as payment method for your Amaze card* Use the amaze card (linked to Amaze wallet) to top up Grabpay Wallet  then proceed to withdraw Grabpay credits to your Bank account since it is withdrawable,btohqsg
Amaze card is very useful  if there are similar card for visa kindly share as well üôè,btohqsg
Thanks Chris. Will there be any additional fees if I use Grab card to top up myCRO.comVisa card? The last round I use Grab to top up Revoult then top upCro.comVisa card.,btohqsg
The easiest way to know is just to give it a tryüòâ,btohqsg
Has anyone try to use UOB One card to pay insurance using third party method like Cardup  renthero or ipaymy?,btohqsg
Base on Kelvin's video  you can pay your insurance using Cardup  and you pay Cardup using UOB One credit card with a 1.85%-2.25% fee. UOB One gives you 3.33% if you spend more than $500 each month for a quarter. So effectively you can earn 1.08%-1.48% and also hit the $500 minimum spending a month.https://youtu.be/DbOobqKFP-4?t=169,btohqsg
I wonder can CRO card be used in cardup??,btohqsg
Cardup actually has a 1.85% to 2.25% charge. So don't think it make sense.,btohqsg
Don't bother using cardup ipaymy unless you are hitting 5% on uob one,btohqsg
I'm having difficulty to hit $500 a month consistently for a quarter. And the variable is my Grabcar/Grabtaxi ranges from $200 - $600 a month. But I'm confident that my cardup ipaymy can hit the $500 monthly.,btohqsg
So what I'm hopefully can do is to use Cardup ipaymy to hit the $500 minimum monthly  effectively 1.08%-1.48% cashback.And unlock additional 5% on all my Grabcar/Grabtaxi and occasional shopee shopping  which is effectively 8.33%. Please correct me if my maths is wrong.,btohqsg
5% CRO card will make sense.,btohqsg
How do I use the CRO card to pay for my insurance to get the 5%?,btohqsg
I don't have CRO card or any coins yet. I don't have enough funds to put everywhere. So kinda need to work around,btohqsg
Hey all. Just to share. We can use Grab card to top upcro.comVisa card without incurring any additional fees. üëçüëçüòÉüòÉ,btohqsg
but iscro.coma eligible grab merchant? GrabReward points only eligible when paying grab merchant isn't it?,btohqsg
I think this would work ifUOB Absolute 1.7% > Grab top up/mastercard > Crypto card 5% (if you stake $50K) > AXS????Not a very pro in credit card counting.,btohqsg
Can some one verify from grab wallet to crypto card don't have FX fee nor dynamic currency conversion fee?,btohqsg
You need to stake 50K to get 5%?,btohqsg
I am also pretty worried. I did a top up of $50 on my Crypto card using Grab,btohqsg
The Grab never deduct any FX or dynamic currency conversion fees.,btohqsg
But can we get cash back using cro card on AXS? My main goal is to get cash back when paying my insurance.,btohqsg
Yes. So asking. Might do it if cro tank further.,btohqsg
Treat it as investment in crypto.,btohqsg
I'm still very new into personal finance  Very very new into investing. So don't have much money to put my money everywhere,btohqsg
So probably only able to get the 1% cro card. Haha,btohqsg
How about transfer money out from cro card? Do cro card eligible for the 1-8% cash back if pay bills via AXS?,btohqsg
Im curious on this as well üòÇ,btohqsg
Whats the best way to get cashback for insurance ? Paying for ILP qlso can ah?,btohqsg
ILP is worst insurance. Almost like scam Yr money.,btohqsg
Hey what are the fees like for withdrawing USD or SGD from Gemini to local DBS USD or SGD account?,btohqsg
Which cashback card allows for insurance payments to get cash back.  Anyone knows?,btohqsg
SGD to DBS FreeUSD to DBS $10 SGD Feehttps://www.gemini.com/fees/transfer-fee-schedule,btohqsg
Amex (Uob or True cashback) > Grabpay > AXS via mastercard,btohqsg
Thank you üôèüèªSGD 10 fee for USD to DBS is flat (regardless of amount transferred)? Cannot really find this info on the website you shared,btohqsg
It's a fee charged from DBS for inbound USD transfers,btohqsg
Hello fellow savers  what card will you recommend to use to pay for wedding dinner packages?,btohqsg
Hi just curious how you all track ur portfolio.,btohqsg
I'm using Beancount  both for personal accounting and investment portfolio,btohqsg
But I guess it's only for people as nerdy as me as it's text-based ü§£,btohqsg
I see ppl use Excel all,btohqsg
Yahoo financeDelta app looks cool to track also.,btohqsg
Just the amount plus minus abit,btohqsg

Can UOB absolute card top-up nets flashpay card and get 1.7% csshback?,btohqsg
Imo  amex uob and gpmc combi for general spend. Citi cash-back care combi with instarem amaze for Groceries and dining,btohqsg
Yup  planning to go with Crypto and Revolut to see how. But most likely will leave Revolut card at home or to bring overseas,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt go overseas. Only if my friends jio me to go msia.,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm quite a boring person  so they usually won‚Äôt call me unless they are lacking of people,btohqsg
Start w a simple Cashback card  w no min spending...,btohqsg
If u have a higher (>$800) spending mthly  then u can look into other Cashback cards...,btohqsg
Track if ur spending is consistent over a few mths...,btohqsg
Happy Chinese New Year to all folks in the Honey Money SG community. May the fortune continue to favour us in this upcoming tiger üêØ year!,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGbtw how important is having Live Stock Market Quotes in your choice brokerage?,btohqsg
as a Trader  i thought having live stock information is critical?so if no Live feeds available  how much time delay are we usually working with on Trading Platforms that don't offer Live Stock Market Quotes?,btohqsg
i understand that only TB offers Real-Time stock data  despite the higher fees and lack of fractional (correct me if im wrong)than IBKR,btohqsg
Happy new year all  just saw UOB T&C started to exclude ‚Äúamaze transit‚Äù mcc code already from March 2022‚Ä¶ so do make your own adjustment,btohqsg
I think most have live if u funded the account.,btohqsg
U ask the broker. Every broker different,btohqsg
And of course live is needed. Let's say u want to buy apple. 10. 00:00pm is $170.10. But your quotes is delayed. So u either going to buy it at higher bid price  fill at market price. If the spread is massive at that moment of time. Good luck.,btohqsg
Not sure why u want to save a few dollar per mth to make yrself risk more money. Unless u are the type of investor  buy and hold the rest of Yr life. Then live quotes is not necessary after buying.,btohqsg
only tonight i actually started looking more in depth into the Trading Platformsrealised that Live Data wasn't a given.,btohqsg
It is important but no need to be in your main brokerage,btohqsg
Thats why you can sign up tiger/moomoo to get live prices and 1 free AAPL stock,btohqsg
i guess its v accustomed to have some competitor's desktop trading app (which ig is TB?) to see live prices and then toggle back to IBKR and trade (for the fees),btohqsg
abit sianz i alr had those accounts since March 2021 but didnt sign via referral code  and left dormant until today.,btohqsg
unless can delete / deactivate those accounts and then signup again via ur referral link? üòÖ,btohqsg
Anyone tried to cancel Syfe trade buy order?I realized I cannot amend my buy order price  hence I cancelled the buy order.However it's still pending cancellation after 2hours. I wonder if the cancellation is supposed to be immediate?,btohqsg

Anyone received a call from someone selling insurance with no premium increase up to 75yo? Its called CIMB REVITAL RECOVER+? 66612454 (number). Plan is only for cimb customer and not open to public.,btohqsg

Mine AIA also same same. So dun get conned.,btohqsg
Watched it! So if I have a 20k investment portfolio.. I can still use the financial calculator? Means the starting amount is 20k? Then I will key in e.g.5 years and return rate of e.g.5%?,btohqsg
Yes  just change according to your own metrics,btohqsg
Reply from Syfe..To share  the order has been sent to exchange for cancellation and will be cancelled as per the exchange supported time (before the market opens around 8.30 pm SGT). We are working on upgrading our platform to enhance the experience.,btohqsg

Whats ‚Äúamaze transit‚Äù?? Happy new tiger year to all ??,btohqsg
Need advice on google stock.There is goog and googl  for long term holding should I get googl?,btohqsg
From what I understand there is differences between both of them in term of voting and fees,btohqsg
for me  since my holdings is tiny weenie... i dont care about the voting rights... so i go for cheaper one.. GOOG,btohqsg
For GOOG there is a fee for holding it right?,btohqsg
While GOOGL is a fee during purchase  am I right?,btohqsg
just different share classes with different voting power,btohqsg
it is irrelevant for us retail investors,btohqsg
there will be transaction cost depending on your broker,btohqsg
Thank you so much for clearing my misconceptions,btohqsg
Can check when does revolut cashback comes in?,btohqsg
does anyone have any dp about how the Revolut cashback is tracked for each month? For eg I took a bus trip in Jan  but Revolut only deducted 10c so far as holding fee (without billing/charging/processing the actual fare yet  as this process takes time). So will the cashback for Jan be based on all fares that have been processed as of 31 Jan (which means that this will exclude some fares that were made in Jan  such as those not yet billed/charged to Revolut per se)?,btohqsg
Is it safe to give your credit card number and expiry date (no cvv given) to dominos pizza?,btohqsg
just make sure they are dominos pizza,btohqsg
you can try Revolut and generate a one-time virtual card for merchants you don't trust,btohqsg
(remember to use Chris's referral link for Revolutü§™),btohqsg
And another thing to note  even without CVV  some merchants can still charge from your card. So be careful,btohqsg
Can amex use in axs payment app,btohqsg
Wow  good day for crypto hodlers,btohqsg
I have not figured this out yet. Since remittance to bahamas is not free. Meanwhile i was using Gemini,btohqsg

I prefer to use password managers like LastPass,btohqsg
I even worst.... Only 0.001 differences to fill my order to buy in crypto. Lead to $10k potential profits gone.,btohqsg
Me too. I have so many in my list and all went up more than 10% yesterday. üò≠üò≠üò≠ I only bought SHIB and DOGE few weeks ago.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGare u able do a review on Geminiand likewise another video on how to waive the credit card annual fee - perpetually ?,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKUpxMcG_R4Will consider the annual fee waiver video,btohqsg
Hi  I have been using UOB absolute to top up my grab wallet. But don't see any cash back. Is the cashback updated at the end of the month or?üòÖ,btohqsg
gemini still better in terms of fees for withdrawal and for purchasing,btohqsg
then you need to read up on how to do unlimited FTX withdrawals with no staking required,btohqsg
I also use a API to do DCA into gemini,btohqsg
Nice.. probably crypto is good for redemption of Spotify n Netflix only..tks,btohqsg

Just watched the video. Just to ask didn't see any comparison between hodlnaut & CDC?,btohqsg
CDC is staking  which means you need to lock it in. Hodlnaut can withdraw at will,btohqsg
but yeah  i should include CDC for fair comparison,btohqsg
Yup. Guess got to choose between flexibility and interest rate,btohqsg
CDC has so many staking options.,btohqsg
Recently I just signed up for CDC card because I watched all the credit card videos. Basically to reduce my spending.,btohqsg
"I just started to learn all the skating options  CDC has ""Earn""  ""Supercharger""  ""Defi wallet"" and ""Exchange"".",btohqsg
congrats. staking at CDC is a great first step,btohqsg
can take some time to explore other crypto platforms.e.g CRO staking in keplir wallet offers much higher interest rates.Also  you can stake your eth/btc elsewhere to earn more than 7% APR,btohqsg
Anyone have use the grab card for YouTube subscription having prob to add in,btohqsg
I think it cannot be done with prepaid card.,btohqsg

Just checking anyone received the $120 capital voucher how will we get and when,btohqsg
I just got my UOB absolute card. Does topping up grabpay wallet consider eligible transaction so i can meet the 1.5k transaction requirement?,btohqsg
What is this 1.5K requirement? Sign up bonus?,btohqsg
I'd say as long as it rewards cashback for Grabpay topup  then there's a good chance it is still eligible,btohqsg
Yup. Sign up bonus. So i can just top-up 1.5k first and slowly use it?,btohqsg
Quick qn  From ftx Pro to ftx block folio  how to trf usd to usdc ah?,btohqsg

Why SCB SMART Credit cardhttps://bit.ly/scbsmart  may be the best no min spend cashback card.I will do a follow up video on best cashback cards with no min spend for 2022!Meanwhile  sign-up using my Singsaver linkhttps://bit.ly/scbsmartto get $300 (new) or $30 (existing) for the Standard Chartered Smart cardhttps://youtu.be/pXevl-ayrzU,btohqsg
Nice one but the thought of eating fast food using this card is not too healthy :),btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs a card that won‚Äôt go wrong if you can get the annual fee waive.,btohqsg
Hi allNew here  looking to connect to like minded individuals and business for day trading and business investments,btohqsg
One thing to share about this card is  I got several scam calls after using this card. The callers knew my card number and my name  and claimed that my card would be blocked due to 'suspicious transactions'  but judging from the calling numbers  I believe they are just scammers.,btohqsg
It's really weird  as I have never received any similar scam calls about my other cards.,btohqsg
Additional information about Grabpay in this video too,btohqsg
Just got my AMEX and done with the $5k grab top up. I'm deciding between SC smartcard and UOB one/absolute next  whichever has better sign up bonus. But SC has $300 Paynow which is very good ,btohqsg
So probably get SC first and wait for better sign up bonus from UOB,btohqsg
Hi  just to check if by using the icbc zodiac card to top up grabpay wallet  is it eligible for the cashback? thanks!,btohqsg

Been using since January 18  spend 2k on it already  still reflect as 0 i. the amaze wallet. How long would it take to reflect the cashback?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/aw5HHAjCu5MReferral code: NhkWBHWhy use Instarem Amaze?+ Favorable FX conversion rate+ No DCC Fee+ Add 1% cashback on top of your card rewards+ Tracked as online spending  even if you use the physical card or mobile contactless* Cashback received on 25th calendar day 1 month after calendar quarter* Cashback credited to Amaze wallet  which can be linked as payment method for your Amaze card* Use the amaze card (linked to Amaze wallet) to top up Grabpay Wallet  then proceed to withdraw Grabpay credits to your Bank account since it is withdrawable#amaze,btohqsg
Do you still get amaze cashback if you top up grab? If so isnt that an infinite money glitch?,btohqsg
Use uob absolute to top up grab you get 1.7% cashback  amaze only 1%  if amaze allows in the first place. Not tried cos uob abso is higher cashback,btohqsg
True but if you can't withdraw then it's money that is stuck with grab,btohqsg
Can use SC SMART CC to top-up grab n earns the cashback?,btohqsg
Nope. I checked. Top up to prepaid cards not considered as qualifying spend,btohqsg
I watch your new video  Best Cashback credit card with no min spend. At 2:00  you was talking about public transport.Question: Can i use GrabPay card top up Revolut account for public transport? Which I will get more Grab points from topup and 20% cashback when i use any Revolut card on public transport? Until end of march?,btohqsg
Top-up revolut with grab no points,btohqsg
Revolut needs bank transfer $100 to qualify for 20% cashback.If from credit card top up 100 then only 2%,btohqsg
I did. I use uob absolut and amex true cashback card to top up grab,btohqsg
Anyway Revolut transport cashback credited on Feb 8,btohqsg
Almak! I transfer $20 using my debt card for their metal card. üòÇ,btohqsg
As long as the $100 bank deposit is within the same month  you will qialify,btohqsg
That means I need to do bank transfer $100 over,btohqsg
Okok. But end at march right?,btohqsg
Oh ok. Does the amex card topup grab considered as spend to qualify for the promo gifts?,btohqsg
I called Smartsaver... they told me topups do not qualify as spending for promo gifts.,btohqsg
For now. Has been extended consistently since Sep 2021,btohqsg
Singsaver follows AMEX rules. If Amex not giving cashback for the purchase  then not eligible. Since Grab is eligible for cashback (For now)  it qualifies,btohqsg
Its automated right? No need to forward the bill to Singsaver?,btohqsg
yes  as long as you filled up the singsaver form and have a Paynow tagged to your phone number,btohqsg
Oh so smartsaver do not qualify and singsaver qualify,btohqsg
The basic card has not much benefit,btohqsg
Oh ya true . Just trying out ..,btohqsg

hey! I'm a self employed person and I have question on how much cash should i top up to my CPF account to be able to pay for a HDB flat in the future. I saw in one of your videos that you use a substantial amount from the OA account to pay for it leaving $20k. thats quite a big sum. I will like to know how to get such a big sum over the years through how much money i put in every month.,btohqsg
Different things. How much you top up to cpf doesn't mean you have enough funds to secure your hdb mortgage payment.Cpf oa is just a form of payment. Topping up cpf for tax relief only has options for SA and MA  which do not matter fot housing payment,btohqsg
First determine what budget you have for housing  then work backwards to calculate how much oa needed  with your income level,btohqsg
I'm actually looking forward to endowus and syfe update video. But we all know the market hasn't been good  so don't think there would be much positive results.,btohqsg

I saw crypto has a crypto pay QR scan. Do anyone know whether it uses the money in our debit card or sell our crypto to pay?,btohqsg
Hi Chris A friend  aged 50 this year will work until at least 65 (could be more years)OA 100kSA 101kMA 63kAlready rstu 8k this year..So urgent strategy is to transfer 3k OA to MA  transfer 80k OA to SA  leave 20k in OA  is it necessary to leave min 20k in OA or as long as SA > 60k  will get extra 1% for full amount 60k? Is this correct quick strategy?,btohqsg
If OA not required for housing  education  investments etc  can consider pushing into SA till FRS (192k). Before 55 yrs old  extra 1% on 1st 60k combined CPF balances in this order (OA up to 20k --> SA--> MA),btohqsg
If OA is 0  1st 60K of SA will receive extra 1% interest,btohqsg
Syfe just done on 31 Jan. Endowus coming this week,btohqsg
Anyway you cannot transfer OA-MA  only OA-SA is possible,btohqsg
Last year the earnings were quite positive  very interesting to watch.But now everything red red. Very sad to watch it.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to withdraw or transfer out the Instarem cashback? Thanks,btohqsg
Use it to top up grab account,btohqsg
Then can withdraw out cuz its recognised as debit card topup,btohqsg

If he transfer 91k to SA  to reach 192k ie FRS  so he will not get hos tax relief for 8k a year rstu right?,btohqsg
Do other CC company give flash deals also?,btohqsg
plenty. Citibank does them tooDBS too,btohqsg
Intend to get SC or UOB,btohqsg
Sc flash deal coming tomorrow  details out tonight 9pm,btohqsg
Is there a way to find out when is the flash deal going to happen before it does?,btohqsg
He has to decide if the tax relief from RSTU of 8k a year is more important  or the compounding of SA (FRS)at 4% is more important. Tax relief can still be obtained by topping up MA if he wishes to  if MA is below BHS,btohqsg

Can't  can only hope. Anyway next slot 3pm coming,btohqsg
Dimensional for world equity or core equity funds. Lionglobal for s&p500,btohqsg
But Endowus is not the cheapest for SRS investing in S&p500,btohqsg
I have a portfolio with them under general investment.I saw one of ur video that you recommend dimensional?Watched it some time back... can't recall :),btohqsg
What is the best platform to invest CPF OA? Really interested in lion global for SP500 you had in your video,btohqsg

Joint deposit account? or joint credit card account??,btohqsg
I think just get from any of the local bank will do. I used POSB which is min $500,btohqsg
Good to have a joint acct in a bank where both of you also has a single name acct. I use POSB too. The reason is  sometimes you may need to transfer funds from singlt to joint or vice versa in big amt. If it is within same bank  no concern about setting the correct transfer limit.,btohqsg

That‚Äôs right. This is my personal opinion. If you want to get intocrypto.comcard  I‚Äôll encourage you to stake $500 CRO and get the Ruby Red tier.,btohqsg

That card meaning the CDC card? No need. I use Amex to pay. Then I email them my amex bill showing the Spotify transaction. Then they reimburse me. üëç,btohqsg
Just curious  why don't you pay with your CRC card?,btohqsg
Because the CDC card can't be added as a payment method in Spotify for some reason. Tried a few times so I emailed them that I couldn't add it as payment method. So they told me to email them my amex statement and they will reimburse,btohqsg
So you need to email them the statement every month?,btohqsg
nope. I've only done so for January. I got the reimbursement for Jan and Feb. Not sure how they track also. (i also wonder about this loophole),btohqsg

RA always take money from SA first. RSTU-SA will increase the SA amount reserved that cannot be shielded,btohqsg
Meaning your advice is to use the OA to SA method  what if i use both OA to SA and RSTU to SA?,btohqsg
Sure  I did that too concurrently,btohqsg
just make sure you have enough OA to use for investing/housing/education stuff before transferring,btohqsg

Hi Chris  RSTU upon retirement  we are not able to draw out these amounts. What about Voluntary Contributions to 3 CPF accounts? Any restriction on that?,btohqsg
VC3A has no restrictions on withdrawalJust to clarify on the withdrawal part. Most of the RSTU funds will be reserved and go to the RA  unless your SA is 100% made up of RSTU funds  and hence above Frs  those can be withdrawn,btohqsg
Hi Chris  had completed endowus sign up using your link. Just want to check that for buying lion global us 500 using CPF OA  my agent bank (DBS) will charge per buy trade and also quarterly fee?,btohqsg
What about OA trf to SA? Is it considered?,btohqsg
I think he mentioned if OA transfer to SA  once the amount hit retirement sum  the excess can be drawn out. No restriction. Inside his video. The only concern will be the RSTU portion,btohqsg
All VC3A l  VCMA and OA transfer SA can withdraw above FRS.RSTU funds mostly go to RA at 55 (thats why can't withdraw),btohqsg
So RSTU purpose is to build that RA base so that your VC and transfer can all withdraw,btohqsg

Hi Chris! One of the advice you shared was to top up MA to BHS first so that the excess contribution to MA will overflow to SA (if SA has not hit FRS).Can I ask - instead of topping up MA to BHS  why can‚Äôt I top up $8k directly to SA  since SA and MA share the same interest rate of 4%  and since the $8k tax relief is shared between RSTU and VCMA? I.e. if i top up $1k to MA to max to BHS so the excess can flow to SA  and the remaining $7k to SA - why can‚Äôt I just top up $8k to SA directly?,btohqsg
There's actually a lot of thought behind this but i'll simplify here,btohqsg
1) it is easier to hit BHS ($66K) than FRS ($192K)2) More uses of MA (pay medical insurance) instead of SA3) VCMA funds are not reserved for RA  meaning it can be shielded. RSTU-SA funds are reserved for RA  cannot be shielded4) Once MA is maxed at BHS  Contributions to MA will overflow to SA (Super charged SA).then once SA is maxed at FRS  contributions to MA overflows to OA (Supercharged OA),btohqsg
Like now my SA reached FRS and MA reached BHS  31% of my income goes into OA  useful for investing and housing6% continues to go into SA,btohqsg

shifu should have video to explain right?,btohqsg

Actually for monthly $100 USD is very small amount  either Syfe Select custom CSPX or Syfe Trade VOO.IBKR UK commission $2 + Monthly $2 fx conversion for a $100 DCA is too expensive,btohqsg

Just wanted to ask  if it's possible to get better credit cards (with more perks) solely by spending more and paying on time? or is income the main factor? for example if i were to spend 10-20k a month and pay on time every month but my income is only 5-6k  would i be able to get better cards that are out of my income range?,btohqsg
another question  if you only earn 5-6k  how could you spend that much sustainably?ü§£,btohqsg
just a hypothetical question  parents money  company entertaining expenses etc? üòÖ,btohqsg
Firstly  what are the better credit cards that you are eyeing for? Most of the prestige credit cards come with non-waiveable annual fees which don't make sense unless you can utilize all their benefits.Secondly  banks still look at income mostly. Usually from 30k  the next tier is $120k per annum,btohqsg
so just by spending and paying on time isnt enough?,btohqsg
credit card perks is designed for the mass market or at least a group of targeted audience. paying on time is a must for consumer because the interests accrued is crazily high. of course the bank love it when consumer does default on their payment as it is much easier money,btohqsg
Any thoughts on Revolut or Hugo Card that invest in Gold?,btohqsg
If I just buy cspx from syfe  need to pay rebo fees or have totally free 2  trade a mth?,btohqsg
Yeah like what@summertonsaid. It is expected to pay on time so no extra benefits to qualify you for higher tier card.Anyway my suggestion is always to sign up for the entry tier cards and the signup rewards to build some credit history with the bank and CBS first so they recognize you as a good customer  then proceed to upgrade when your income allows,btohqsg

"I applied for citi cashback and linked it to Amaze to buy NTUC grocery. The transcation on citi bill is stamped as ""Amaze*NTUC"". So will I still get the 8%(citi) +1%(Amaze) =9% cashback in together?",btohqsg
Yes  do note Amaze cashback comes after the calendar quarter at 25th day,btohqsg
Do note FOREX is high risk  high return. This is not for beginners and i do not recommend,btohqsg
You can check with those who invested with SamTrade,btohqsg
they all have great returns  then suddenly not able to withdraw money,btohqsg
I told peoples not to invest in these instrument until saliva also dry,btohqsg
KskLook  I know you are passionate about FX trading and it may have made a lot of money for you (that's absolutely good for you). But I care for my subscribers and group members such that I don't even talk about FX trading because of the risks involved. If you want to promote this kind of money making activity  here is not the right place.Like@boontee86said  let's just move on from this conversation. Any further discussion on this will trigger a ban from any of the admins,btohqsg
Anything also can happen on these FX trading. I am a victim of Samtrade.,btohqsg
Have you read any due diligence post on Samtrade?,btohqsg
I even have friends with million frozen,btohqsg
Sure  crypto is fine. I will ask@wilflareto keep an eye on it,btohqsg
I think I will just stop here. Just want to warn guys here as long as you are not trading with your own $  then u are subjected to Hugh risk.,btohqsg
Not sure if you even watch my channel?,btohqsg
Anyone here owned amex gold kinda tempted to get it because it's gold..... And currently sitting on 60k annual income,btohqsg
not very well known or well used in singapore,btohqsg
as the AMEX Platinum Credit Card gives better perks for dining if you are willing to shelve out $140 in terms of annual fees,btohqsg
CPF medisave top up capped at 8k? if want to top up more per year cant?,btohqsg
received a check refund from CPF for excess amount,btohqsg
Yeah not much benefits and slapped with an annual fee  not something I would look into,btohqsg
Most likely your CPF contributions from 2021 income exceeded the CPF Annual limit of $37 740,btohqsg
For 2022 onwards it is not a concern anymore as you can VCMA up to BHS  ignoring CPF annual limit,btohqsg
Noleh  how much we can top up to MA per year,btohqsg
The best strategy for crypto is use only 1-5% of your networth (u likely can take it if it goes to zero). Then  if you fear holding the crypto since it can go to zero but could go to 10x (assymetric bet)  when your crypto goes 2x  sell halve the quantity to get back your initial investment  and hold the other half - this is called ‚Äúplaying with house money‚Äù.  If this crypto goes to 10x  u wont make 9x (10x - capital) but u will make 5x.  I think this is a safer less greedy strategy. One youtuber calls this the ‚Äúlittle old lady‚Äù strategy.Then rinse and repeat on another crypto you think can 10x..,btohqsg
Sadly I don't qualify for the plat CC as it's a 80k annual income card I'm only 60k,btohqsg
Noted. I personally feel that there are other credit cards (30K income req) that will beat the AMEX Gold card hands down. So just my opinion that I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going for the gold card.,btohqsg
Just my own opinion  choose the card to complement your lifestyle not the other way. Maybe grab card is already good enough üòÜ,btohqsg
same idea here  though with several cards  I now mainly use Grab card + AMEX as I really don't want to keep track of messy stuff like merchant categories. whatsoever,btohqsg
Hi  besides DBS Altitude n Citi Premier  which other credit cards allow free access to airport lounge? Thanks in advance.,btohqsg

you referring totomb.finance?for anyone jumping in  as usual please DYOR.tomb was hacked before and was only rescued by a billionaire Harry Yeh. what that translates into  only time can tell but please do your own risk assessment,btohqsg
This is just scratching the surface of crypto farming lol. And of all farms  the farms in the fantom ecosystem are very degen very risky and not suitable for average retail investor.,btohqsg

Anyone know if there‚Äôs anyway to topup cro with cc other than thru grab?,btohqsg
Anybody heard of ellufa before on crypto?,btohqsg
No need  purely apply for their card based on income level,btohqsg
you are topping up fiat (SGD)or buying crypto with CC?can use Revolut,btohqsg
some would say avoidunless you are applying for a job therewhich it seems to pay pretty well,btohqsg
I do use Revolut but only plan to go into Gold and not the Crypto,btohqsg
cakedefi suck  30% apy but it is inflation coin,btohqsg
Another good card for this is Maybank FnF (8%) + Amaze (1%). But because of the cap and specific categories it is quite difficult to track  but rewarding if you can hit those requirements,btohqsg

don't be sad. you still have@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
I think it is a good reminder to everyone that behind any personality is a human made of blood and flesh. A human could only take on so much damage from critism  doubt  judgement etc. End of the day  Don't shit on people when they are already down. Be nice  or just mind your own business. You never know what the other party is going throughI wished CGS a good journey to take care of his mental health in his comments section and return whenever he is ready. He is still a great inspiration to the Singapore Finance/Online Content Creator community.,btohqsg
what happen to him actually ?,btohqsg
Too many keyboard warrior bash about him. Even though everything he do is very transparent and real.,btohqsg
I am sad too! Respect his decision,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I watched your video regarding hodlnaut. It is really fruitful sharing. My name is Richard from Malaysia. I am wondering besides FTX  is there any other way to deposit into hodlnaut?,btohqsg
Hmm. It seem moomoo with the free 180 days commission coupon is cheaper to trade in US and especially one lump sum,btohqsg
The IBKR seem to charge me base on per share I bought while moomoo seem to offset the cost and charge only $1 USD per trade,btohqsg
IBKR only charges $0.35 USD when using Tiered rate,btohqsg
Thanks bro. I change to tier rate. I forgot when I was reading the fee,btohqsg
Great. Let me check later. Thanks bro.,btohqsg

I dont think it is a keyboard warrior issue. I was watching a US based you tube Everything Money which is based on Buffett style value investing and chicken genius slammed value investing as irrelevant talking about Tesla  facebook and growth stocks investing  Everything Money was brutal in their criticism.  And many others too like Meet Kevin.  But ‚ÄúMeet Kevin‚Äù has encouraging words for ‚Äúchicken genius‚Äù to make a come back.https://youtu.be/Xu8B_cwHBCQ. And even gave his suggestion.  I think this is very positive.,btohqsg
