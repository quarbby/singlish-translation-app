2 of the plates look the same too,btohqsg
You have my envy that the system works for you.,btohqsg
I want to get rich too,btohqsg
What loophole is there for property,btohqsg
How do I buy cheaper property,btohqsg
And prosper like hong Kong landlord,btohqsg
Oh so how the rich get richer? Or buy more properties?,btohqsg
If they can afford first before thinking of hogging car resources. Same as parking lots issues. No parking lot  cannot buy car like in some countries,btohqsg
Yeah at least we have limit on number of cars,btohqsg
I wanna know what is the loophole here,btohqsg
And can always find decently priced parking wherver we go,btohqsg
And season parking is not exorbitantly expensive,btohqsg
Office building is a different case,btohqsg
Cue finbros taking mrt cause 1k season parking,btohqsg
Property loopholes? Search on the trust thingy lor,btohqsg
Doesnt look like a loophole to me,btohqsg
Parking is cheap in singapore lah. Only the rich are wiling to gamble and then say they can afford to pay the fines.,btohqsg
Sorry I wasnâ€™t referring to companies in general. Sorry for my use of words. It was on living trust for property to avoid any absd,btohqsg
Even so each child can only hold 1 property  and must be paid in full,btohqsg
And that if one household with all the eligible adults bidding for coe  then sure defeat the quota thingy,btohqsg
Not when it was in beneficial terms,btohqsg
Yes  so no matter what  the rich can find ways to own the cars,btohqsg
Exactly. So must make them pay more,btohqsg
How if they can avoid by putting in other names our housesholds?,btohqsg
Property bought under trust cannot be conditional,btohqsg
So living in hdb but with 3 cars parking in hdb parking lots  does that sound right to begin with? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
That means they already paying more taxes than ever. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Of course it doesnt  but how many are doing that,btohqsg
Oh my. Itâ€™s time to ðŸ’¤.,btohqsg
And each person required the car for a different purpose  and each pays  e.g. 100k coe,btohqsg
Ok sure. This is going nowhere anyway,btohqsg
How to be of different purpose when it is hogging,btohqsg
The argument that not all are utilised thus do not commit the same carbon pollutants in total  means one can hog the carbon credits right?,btohqsg
Not hogging if not using  provided parked in private property,btohqsg
Private property is not hdb lor.,btohqsg
U can have a 6.0L car or 60L  if u dont use it  u emit less than a 1.0L car travelling 10k a year,btohqsg
Those who can afford private property with means to park more than one car  by all means.,btohqsg
Yup. Pay more is my context for additional luxury,btohqsg
One wife not enough must find mistresses and just pay niah,btohqsg
U guys can be best friends,btohqsg
But at least those mistresses are paid. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Stuck around more than me as well this time,btohqsg
Cant stand it when facts are twisted people say things out of hearsay,btohqsg
Still using some brain power to check soemthing,btohqsg
I hope it's not how fast you can empty your tank of fuel,btohqsg
Hahahaha its not. But it should be equally satisfying,btohqsg
Well in that case  I wish you luck with whatever you're doing,btohqsg
As long as it isn't insanely illegal or a violation of human rights,btohqsg
Loads and loads. But in essence  it was discussion of revising the coe and road tax system  which digressed to economics  supply and demand  and the rich and poor gap,btohqsg
i was playing game w fellow ur sgcm members ðŸ˜›,btohqsg
