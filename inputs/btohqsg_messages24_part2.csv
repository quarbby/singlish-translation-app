They way hdb sell the bto..gov say they don't control the resale price..but the bto price so high..this will just push resale price even higher..1.5mil maybe common in few years time.Low income single/family...really atb to them..,btohqsg
Thank you for answering! I tot EHG only need one person to be more than 12 months?,btohqsg
So means if the hdb loan canâ€™t cover the remaining of my property price  I canâ€™t do a bank loan on top? The only way is maybe to find a loan shark or smth?,btohqsg
Is hdb loan usually higher or lower than bank loan amount?,btohqsg
Also combined income cannot be >9k,btohqsg
Although this illustration I still donâ€™t understand.,btohqsg
I wanna know what hdb is smoking,btohqsg
hi guys any idea what is this? (circled in Red),btohqsg
There's 1 specific grant that needs 2 people to hit 12 months I think? Can't remember which one.-> If I mixed it up  paiseh.,btohqsg
Uh not that I know of. Only 1 grant for bto and I'm not so familiar about resale grants but I don't rmb there being one too,btohqsg
No man. I also donâ€™t understand this. Like I can afford a 600k flat down payment. My combined income cannot get grants. >9k. But then my max loan is only 580k,btohqsg
In their visual they assume 60k grants  but somehow this salary enough to loan 580k???60k grants means $3k salary  which will be like 200k loan (based on 1 experience maybe abit diff for each person but cannot be that diff that it can jump from 200k loan to almost 600k loan right),btohqsg
can play around with the calculator,btohqsg
Or is it as long as u can make the first 10% down payment. And the other 10% upon key collection?,btohqsg
Then month by month struggle lol?,btohqsg
No  its fully determined by your combine income,btohqsg
I believe the applicant must have their mobile number registered . The HDB officer could call them to confirm if they are giving up their queue . That would be ok .. unless the applicant switched off or donâ€™t answer any call,btohqsg
If the calculator says we cannot afford it are we still able to purchase the place?,btohqsg
when do we need to pay the shortfall amount in cash?,btohqsg
Still 500-700 k with 20% clawbackGov will not allow 1M BTO to happenSimply increase clawback can le hahaha,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why  gov realised their mistake for not launching AMK under PrimeSo  from Oct 2024 onwards  Plus implemented with 10 years MOP  so flats can be affordable since this is what people asked for,btohqsg
Is it possible to increase our hdb loan?,btohqsg
Bank loan and hdb loan Both will have same amount using30% MSRThe only way to increase your loan amount is increase your salary,btohqsg
actually in fact bank loan may be lesser because interest rate higher,btohqsg
Ohh if the hdb calculator says our budget is ard 400k but the bto we are looking at is around 700k  this means that if we do get the flat we have to pay 300k in cash when we collect the keys?,btohqsg
I also hope i can strike toto,btohqsg
Its not possible to reassess our income closer to key collection date and get a high loan correct?,btohqsg
so the remaining can only be paid either via cash or cpf oa  is there any limit on how much can be paid via cpf oa?,btohqsg
am i able to drain it fully?,btohqsg
is it possible to get other loans to finance it?,btohqsg
Why not finance with bank loan?,btohqsg
we only clicked on hdb loan for our hfe  is it still possible to change?,btohqsg
hmm okays  thank you for all the help!,btohqsg
Either you or your partner should have worked for 14 months when you guys apply for HFE,btohqsg
I see  is it possible that when I apply grant they only consider my partner (cuz she worked for 12 months and Iâ€™m only 2 months)  but when I apply loan they count the overall income  in this case I can get a high grant with a high loan?,btohqsg
Hi all. May I check  if you cancel your bto application before signing the agreement of lease (which means you've paid the option fee)  are you still considered as first timer after being banned for one year?,btohqsg
High grant should mean lower loan,btohqsg
No ideabut more logically the ban should kick in when applicant does not select a flat despite given an appointment to do soIf option fee has been paid  it would be forfeited when BTO application is cancelled (if i don't remember wrongly),btohqsg
Yea  option fee is non-refundable. However after the one year ban  if decided to apply for bto again is the applicant considered as first timer still or second timer? Coz the grants all return back mah,btohqsg
Information that has been made public is -> grant - must have worked for full 12 months for income assessment> loan - must be working at the point of application  so both you and your partner's income should be assessedThings which are not officially made known (as far as i know) but gathered from people who shared their experiences -> the norm is lower income / higher grant / lower loan> for HLE but potentially applicable for HFE too: there may be reassessment of income when nearing key collection but more of  wanting to make sure that you can repay the loan amount that you were eligible forIf your income is lower than in the past  loan reassessed and may be loweredIf your income has increased  no change to loan amountEither you or your partner must have worked for at least 14 months when applying for HFE because of the cut off date,btohqsg
So  your question is  grant credited to your CPF account  then you want to cancel application before the appointment to sign lease...?,btohqsg
I forgot what the documents say leBut had them filed nicely ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
Haha  yeah cancel then if want to apply again is it consider first timers? Cause if second timer lower chance hor,btohqsg
Legal fees not refundable as it's considered utilisation of the service,btohqsg
Lower chance doesn't mean no chanceThere are also many first timers who don't get queue numbersPlus  ballot is more like luck or fate...,btohqsg
oh yes yes  of course!! Was just wondering how it affects if you're second timer,btohqsg
It start when HDB processed the cancellation,btohqsg
HFE does NOT have reassessment closer to key collection (unless you're under the deferred assessment scheme).This has been confirmed by calls with HDB and emails that people have shared in chats before.,btohqsg
Now the BTO price are more expensive. The tanglin halt cascadia 4 room BTO (Oct 2023) price from $537 000.00 to $702 000.00,btohqsg
Looks like reassessment is potentially applicable - HDB might ask applicant about their income situation when nearing key collection  like HLE practice. Otherwise  how will they know whether applicant is still employed when disbursing the loan?Even for HLE  based on what some people have shared  there isn't exactly reassessment per seHowever  HDB would contact applicant when nearer to key collection and renew the loan eligibilityProblem may arise when applicant's income is decreased. That is when income gets reassessed and loan amount eligible may be lowered tooBecause lower income is perceived as lower ability to repay loan,btohqsg
