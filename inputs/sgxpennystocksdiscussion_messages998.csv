As of March 4  2025  determining the exact amount of funding remaining in the CHIPS and Science Act requires looking at the total allocation and the amounts awarded or committed to date. The CHIPS Act  signed into law in August 2022  provided $52.7 billion overall  with $39 billion specifically earmarked for manufacturing incentives to bolster U.S. semiconductor production. The rest supports research  development  and other programs.Based on available data up to early 2025  the U.S. Department of Commerce  which administers the CHIPS Program Office  has made significant progress in allocating these funds. By May 13  2024  Bloomberg News reported that $32.8 billion of the $39 billion manufacturing fund had been allocated. Since then  additional awards have been finalized or announced:,btohqsg

Yanlord made a huge RMB3.4bn (or S$625mn) write down of their development properties in 2024 (FY23 S$270mn). Presales were down 31% in FY24 to RMB22.3bn. The stimulus was an acknowledgement by authorities of the dire situation in real estate.  Sales have improved post-stimulus but it is unclear if momentum can be sustained. Developers still have high-priced landbanks to clear. Yanlord has 4 years of landbank or inventory to sell. Tier 1 cities Shanghai and Shenzhen and some core Tier 2 cities have been performing better.,btohqsg

The yield on e 10-year US Treasury note eased to below the 4.23% mark on Friday  reapproaching e four-month low of 4.16% touched Monday as uncertainty about e US trade policy magnified e pessimistic growth outlook to extend Wall Street's pivot to safety. President Trump opted to exempt Mexican & Canadian goods under e USMCA from newly-imposed tariff packages for one month before pledging to not allow any more relief going forward. Still  pledges of aggressive spending cuts & uncertainty over future economic policy due to e administration's contradicting signals kept demand for Treasuries high.,btohqsg
