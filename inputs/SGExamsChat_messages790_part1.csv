My school offered O Level English  Chinese  Math and Science if they managed to score 70% and above in sec 3,btohqsg
I forgot abt the criterias alrd cuz long ago,btohqsg
She take express science from s1,btohqsg
Then sec 2 take express maths,btohqsg
Ok to be specific  Sec 5 NA take O level HCL,btohqsg
Then that means bro gotta take o lvl chi in sec 4,btohqsg
never allowed a math in mine,btohqsg
imagine the jump from NA CL to O level HCL,btohqsg
O level HCL is harder than h1 chinese,btohqsg
Mine got like na ppl can take express subjs from s1,btohqsg
O level Chinese SBB at Sec 4 NA and then Sec 5 take HCl,btohqsg
I love being acoustic exempted from MT,btohqsg
Ya that makes more sense la,btohqsg
It's siao  my cl teacher in na accidentally gave us a HCl paper one time,btohqsg
Literally nobody could understand the first para,btohqsg
In sec school there was the HCl magazine,btohqsg
"Sad story is for JC  I was the only person who did not score very well for CL  so end up I was the only one transferred to the ""weak in H1 Chinese"" class",btohqsg
there is a sec 5 student takes both chinese and higher chinese. but did not take English. I am confused üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
My whole class is Chinese passaway one,btohqsg
We don't take it srly also,btohqsg
Urr someone in my class unironically got U tho,btohqsg
So when we collecting MT a level results  I was the only one being happy for scoring an S for H1 MT,btohqsg
I was kinda sad when I saw I got C,btohqsg
But meh considering how much I gave a shit,btohqsg
Same that's why when the teacher give a compo assignment my class takes 1 month to finish,btohqsg
ok cuz my chi cher also my PW cher I go tell him,btohqsg
See I sacrifice Chinese for pw,btohqsg
"For us  is ""if you do finish your compo during recess  you donnid come class  so can leave sch early""",btohqsg
Something I found odd is most of the teachers in my school don't hold back students for recess,btohqsg
the na chinese teacher have to teach hanyupinyin and read every single word in textbook because the students cannot even read,btohqsg
But you know they should have because the following lesson etc  you alr move on to next topic,btohqsg
Sometimes my sis speaks chi in ABIT of ang mo accent also,btohqsg
Mine too  like my class were shit at chinese but were too damn hardworking cus we need pass chinese  so wewillinglydid it during break,btohqsg
And then the prev topic  you will be like...hold on  what did I learn,btohqsg
For some reason I don't rly have any ang mo accent when I speak tho,btohqsg
Nah literally I rmb a chi lesson so vividly. The teacher was going through the format for Chinese email,btohqsg
Best CL class moment was our H1 CL made us watch Taiwanese reality debate shows,btohqsg
My Tamil is non existent haha,btohqsg
Like this occured multiple of classes,btohqsg
"Half way through  the bell rings for recess..I could you not  projector shutoff  laptop shutoff. Stand up say goodbye to teacher and the rest of the class thought nothing much.Following lesson   OK class ""we going to do a trial exam for email""",btohqsg
Ok but tbh is cus for oral  they alr confirmed Chinese media and TV is the topic so make sense,btohqsg
I actually read that watching more tv shows or basically news in chi helps you alot,btohqsg
I took up that advice and actually somewhat improved my Chinese,btohqsg
This JC Cher ik right she teach chi one then I was joking abt how I disappointed my chi cher w my chi gradesShe's deadass like: nevermind go get A for the other subjects lor,btohqsg
Funniest moment  we watched it in x0.5 speed cus the taiwan ppl speak damn fast,btohqsg
My speaking is tolerable is cuz,btohqsg
I literally need to speak it in my family,btohqsg
Hey but y'all with the Korean dramas can watch like 100 episodes and can only do greetings in Korean,btohqsg
but not sure why she do not take English,btohqsg
Then writing n reading I rly don't care then U can guess what happen nexts,btohqsg
