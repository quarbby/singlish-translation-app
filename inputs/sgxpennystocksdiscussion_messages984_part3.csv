Qatar’s Protocol capital wrote back with regard to the put option ($0.050) exercise price.Quite positive IMO.- mentioned they are keen to invest but need to renegotiate.Let’s say they renegotiate to half the initial put price. It’s still a $0.025 investment and naturally a catalyst that would make this one comes alive when they do commit Interesting to see and good to watchlist and follow closely on the updates.$0.009 does looks a good gamble IMO. But DYODd always/ OsOd and react accordingly to market.Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/6H5H0OPG25HY5STR/828172_Tritech%20Group%20Limited%20-%20Update%20on%20Exercise%20of%20Put%20Option.pdf,btohqsg

To me  this doesn't look good. Usually ME investors don't really care about short term SP for investment. It's simply they have signed an agreement to invest  and now wanted to void the contract and create a more favourable one. They know tritech needs the money and try to take the board hostage.,btohqsg
