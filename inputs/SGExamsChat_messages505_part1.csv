the fact this module have no pre reading,btohqsg
"and the lecturer was like ""you need to do pre reading""",btohqsg
there was no pre reading to begin with,btohqsg
its the lecturer that my whole class did not like,btohqsg
"he is the same lecturer that told classmates ""im not google  why ask me"" and also ""think about why i only need to work 2 out of 5 days of the week  be smart..like me""",btohqsg
cant do much in rp tho,btohqsg
no use in getting rid of the teacher  but we did complained as a class and our grades got changed,btohqsg
most of our grades got changed  from 10 failures to 1 failure after we complained,btohqsg
btw  in rp...dismissal time for modules is on the lecturers,btohqsg
some of my classmates start lesson at 8:30 end at 12,btohqsg
others like me 8:30 then go all the way to 3:30,btohqsg
If the lecturer feels like dimissing you  they will dismiss you,btohqsg
no  the lecturer can change the attendance,btohqsg
ok my programming lecturer literally talks so fast and when we ask him to repeat he looks so annoyed... and now because of this lecturer that programming module is my weakest module.worst thing is  most of the people in my class likes him only because he gives us long breaks and lesser homework...,btohqsg
whatever the fuck that isi literally hate my course,btohqsg
they dont teach C in rp  i think,btohqsg
only java and python i heard,btohqsg
give me a sec  ill check the list of 6ps,btohqsg
if i fail that stupid programming module its my lecturers fault,btohqsg
so yea they dont teach C  maybe yr 3 but idk,btohqsg
must force myself to study a course i dont even like,btohqsg
Thats why you need to make friends in rp,btohqsg
and then realize that i might not even get into uni even if i study because my teammates for math mod is shit + im just shit at teamwork,btohqsg
oh what.. my lecturers want to buy more time tho,btohqsg
The thing about quiz in rp is..they dont test at the same time  so if you have classmates from other classes...they can tell you what a quiz you are about to take will look like,btohqsg
ive never even made any friends in pri and sec sch,btohqsg
how do i make friends in polyi try to talk to ppl but they all ignore me,btohqsg
no in rp  its beneficial...you can actually get early info,btohqsg
EXACTLY HOW THE FUCK DO YOU DISCUSS MATH BRO ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
at least business is like makes sense generate ideas,btohqsg
idk last time I did that  I got like c6 bro,btohqsg
so you can prepare for the quiz you are about to take,btohqsg
In rp  the same quiz can be taken by a class on monday and on friday,btohqsg
iw do math now for what,btohqsg
bro like how tf we discuss math sia,btohqsg
and my math lecturer was the one who told me that my grades will drop because im not talking in math module...,btohqsg
I took the same module A113 as you last yr,btohqsg
for Maths  what they want to see is communication,btohqsg
youre just solving math problems bro,btohqsg
When they say teamwork...it means  yall decide as a team and choose someone to present a maths qns,btohqsg
that is the teamwork they are looking for,btohqsg
but like what if i havent do that question yet,btohqsg
because that seems to be the case during lesson 2,btohqsg
no matter...they just want to see you as a team able to work together to have someone different present,btohqsg
honestly   what 's the point of having so much teamwork,btohqsg
you can use your teamates work,btohqsg
and i submitted my homework only by copying my teammates work because i genuinely didnt know how to do a math logarithm...,btohqsg
dont you have the answer sheets?,btohqsg
oh but the ans dont show solutions?,btohqsg
the worst part is by copying my teammates hw im not even learning anything so at the end of the day im still lost and dont know how to do logarithm...,btohqsg
