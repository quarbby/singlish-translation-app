Wobbling wheels - what's causing them?Wobbling wheels can be caused by a variety of factors  from kerb strikes to unbalanced tyres. Torque's resident mechanical engineer addresses this issue.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Do you feel the wheels are wobbling?,btohqsg
complete disaster as typical for them. Honestly i expect this entire initiative to flop and for them to actually u-turn all this rubbish. Its already so difficult for us as car enthusiasts  imagine for a regular person how many will not be able to complete the process,btohqsg
This is how it looks like at danga bay,btohqsg
Opt for postage better if you don't want to waste one day there. haha,btohqsg
Understanding paint protection and why it mattersWe take a look at paint protection and its importance in helping to preserve the value of your car.➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Here is why paint protection is important..,btohqsg
If want windshield tag  got to go down personally. Postage will only send the headlight version.,btohqsg
They are the same thing isn't it?,btohqsg
But how to opt for postage if these idiots didnt even email me despite my registering my vep and having confirmation for years,btohqsg
Different  headlight one is the antenna with transparent backing. Windshield one has the antenna with a blue VEP backing  which in my opinion  is very ugly.,btohqsg
I see.Solution: stick the headlight one on windshield. 😂Less ugly 😂😂😂,btohqsg

"hi guys! i've been visiting singapore since wednesday and i've used a getgo car twice since then (from airport to my hotel on wednesday and today a longer drive around singapore)now they have suspended my account and are demanding that i pay a combined 800 sgd of ""clean up fees"" cause i smoked in the cars.. 🤦‍♀️ does anyone have any idea if i can end up in trouble if i just ignore it and don't pay?",btohqsg
im not sure if u can run without paying. getgo is one of the car sharing providers in singapore. all these car sharing providers often over charge like this,btohqsg
yeah but like they weren't able to charge my card and i'm leaving in three weeks.. like what can they even do if i don't pay?,btohqsg
They cant do shit to u,btohqsg
U are a piece of thrash for smoking in the car lol,btohqsg
I’m at the land down under 🤭,btohqsg
Can cut jo teo n Chee hong salary?,btohqsg
Maybe u shld sue the doctor tht handled u when u were born. Cos i think he/she dropped u,btohqsg
Sis I think I know why u drive grab alr,btohqsg
Be a law abiding person. If you are guilty  pay up. If not  dispute.,btohqsg
So I can complain then get myself $8 voucher,btohqsg
Wah then should cut airport boss salary too sia  and Singtel  etc,btohqsg

I think these ministers hold high positions of authority n earn a lot. They r responsible for ensuring the overall effectiveness of services under their governance. Even if they do not directly manage the tech centers  they r ultimately accountable 4 the performance of their ministries.,btohqsg
If link their salaries to performance  including critical tech reliability  it will incentivise ministers to be more proactive in addressing potential issues.Means more thorough checks n improved risk management,btohqsg
lol would it be better if i stopped the car in the middle of the road and stepped outside every time i need a cig then? 😂🤦‍♀️,btohqsg
but the thing is that it's just a clean up fee or something and not like a fine given by the police,btohqsg
Control ur urge. U r driving a RENTED car. If personal by all means go ahead. Not everyone likes the smoke smell. It isnt illegal  speaks volumes abt yr ethics for others.,btohqsg
oh come on i'm not gonna buy my own car here when i'm visiting for three weeks,btohqsg
if someone is so bothered by the smell they can open the windows and spray some air freshener,btohqsg
So i shudnt flush the toilet if i use it b4 u? Since u cant tolerate the hygiene u can ownself flush?,btohqsg
lol what are you talking about 😂😂,btohqsg
It is written in their Terms and Conditions..,btohqsg
You do you about what you want to do with this information,btohqsg
Will die meh if you never smoke,btohqsg
but it's terms and conditions  not the law.. i could write that anyone who comes to my hotel room has to pay a $1 000 fee but if someone doesn't pay what can i do? 🤷‍♀️,btohqsg
they will try charging the card information  and perhaps lodge a report,btohqsg
Huh tourist can drive GetGo meh? The T&C put tourist cannot use,btohqsg
i already blocked payments going to them,btohqsg
maybe they will ask me to pay a million dollars if they find out i'm a tourist..,btohqsg
Then probably lodge a police report with whatever you provided them for personal information,btohqsg
Haha probably! I know tourist arn’t allowed to drive GetGo rentals. Do they have evidence that you smoke in the car?,btohqsg
T&C say clean up fee is $300. the person say they got charged $800?,btohqsg
Ya cleaning fee is $300  $800 pluck from where,btohqsg
@emmathiccshow us the invoice to validate,btohqsg
but what can the police even do,btohqsg
maybe i left some ashes in the cup holders but i threw all the butts out before returning the cars both times,btohqsg
