I sure give hell back one,btohqsg
I was in fnb own business for 13 years.  Seen many fuck up cheapos from online orders.,btohqsg
Example. Order beef steak from food panda... Customer complain food panda... Every thing was there side dish veggies corn blah blah blah. But the beef steak was not there. So refund..,btohqsg
Possible?????Knn either the rider ate the steak... Or my shop tooooo stupid to forget to put the steak in,btohqsg
Error msg: Something went wrong  pleas try agin next time .,btohqsg
So I complain lor bang table... Take the food panda device to head office.  Smash the device in front of them,btohqsg
Hahaahhaa in the end I still pay 100 plus for the device wahahaha,btohqsg
But I walked away with my ego still intact,btohqsg
Moral of the story money can always earn back.,btohqsg
But if your not wrong.  Stand your ground,btohqsg
Are Fraser malls on extended grace period during this period?,btohqsg
It's not even an ego thing. Once u have this kinda nonsense policy  then word get out and everyone just take for granted.Soon u get more and more ppl using llm to deliver  then complain  coz they know they just have to complain can get free food/cake deliver to them liao,btohqsg
U imagine next time got a birthday  I order a $100+ cake  use llm to deliver.Cake eat half already  make it smashed up abit take pic  ho seh free cake,btohqsg

Anyone has any experience collecting from this place? Canton paradise @ junction 8 bishan. Order timing 1730  till now not ready yetü•≤,btohqsg
llm no stack earning is v low. the long distance jobs are below $10/hour.,btohqsg
I think they want to split the order evenly between drivers,btohqsg
Become like last time where the app prevent u to take another order within half an hour after ur first order.,btohqsg
"Yurp bro oddle order. And not too sure if they miss out on the order or not  fp and grabfood order all do on time. Not my first time having this kind of encounter with them. CS cancel my last order  now get ""ban"" from selecting oddle orderüôÉ",btohqsg
this is for multi location jobs,btohqsg
Today I collected at plaza sing..Korean restaurant ..wait 30 mins .. my next order delay.  üòî,btohqsg
If never stack and how to earn money üí∞ lei,btohqsg
Only 2 order stack and some time 3 order stack.,btohqsg
No stack no do. Very simple philosophy,btohqsg
Parking petrol can easily minus how much of the profit,btohqsg
Not forgetting about dealing with restaurants that likes to start cooking when driver arrived,btohqsg
I always see them stack a few,btohqsg
Llm should at least let us stack 2 .,btohqsg
Just stack. But also must stack smart. Always give urself some buffer time. Don't expect restos to always be on time or early. Know that even if they late they will get benefit of doubt from llm. Factor in some late time of u stack. Plan routes properly. Condos need time for unloading. Rainy weather traffic heavier etc,btohqsg
If u not late  u stack also won't kena anytg,btohqsg
Certain restos u know have habit or late  either don't take their job or factor in the late time,btohqsg
If u take non oddle resto jobs  know that they can/will monitor u. If they put note say don't stack  try not to stack. Or else u kena complain or bad rating,btohqsg
Hello anyone facing withdrawal issues? I cashout on last sunday 21:15pm. They 00:02 reject my withdrawal cuz back then I was performing a cash delivery. I readjust the withdrawal amt then withdraw again. Since last sun until now. More than 7 days no received,btohqsg
How can we feedback to LLam,btohqsg
If gg to stack  know ur pickup location well  like where to park  time needed to walk to the resto n back. Don't wait until go pickup then blur blur. B4 hand if got time recce abit.,btohqsg
No use 1. Llm have alot of drivers  we don't do  anytime got lots more will do,btohqsg
Remember their customers r the restos etc. They won't care us,btohqsg
So still can stack right ?,btohqsg
Anyway Monday to Thursday orders are limited,btohqsg
I always see newbies come in ask where park  etc,btohqsg
Want do delivery not so simple 1 also. Need spend effort n time to know areas,btohqsg
When I join my 1st mth plus I do alot of groundwork  recce roads  resto,btohqsg
Rather than come in ask n wait for answer  experience it urself u learn faster,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt take order fromParagon  Takashimaya  313 Somerset for car. Orchard area avoid unless hotel,btohqsg
If not telok ayer or Robinson area,btohqsg
Try to deliver to Terrance house,btohqsg
Telok ayer Fridays can avoid avoid,btohqsg
N the restos some will be flooded with walk ins n orders,btohqsg
Always have chance to be late,btohqsg
Of cos not all restos  but I don't want take the risk,btohqsg
No stack how to earn  petrol now so ex,btohqsg
Today orders are like really hard to stack,btohqsg
I ft  no stack I eat grass,btohqsg
I see less than 5 $20 order,btohqsg
Is it Because I never put sticker,btohqsg
Plus nowdays more n more bike orders,btohqsg
Deepavali got the $3 surcharge  alot of restos norm use car change to use bike to save cost,btohqsg
80% of orders on those 2 days were bike orders,btohqsg
Llm now harder to do  I see alot of old timers last time in the chat also either change to other platforms or just do less llm or don't bother say anytg liao,btohqsg
I no phv so I just continue,btohqsg
Same family is jialat enough. Most orders are delivered to families,btohqsg
Have to adapt n new strategies or else gg,btohqsg
Last 1 mth plus income drop 20% per week for me. Dunno abt others,btohqsg
One thing. Even do delivery also must use brain. Dun do blindly,btohqsg
But all these is just my sharing. Maybe others r different.,btohqsg
But there is option to do jobs to further  cos always have the chance to fetch a passenger back to where ever u want to go,btohqsg
Anyway  like what ÈªÑÂ§ßÂèî say  use brain. Familiarise  put in some effort. I see newbies keep coming in ask so many qns  wanting to be spoon-fed. If the chat gone or everybody bz  then gg,btohqsg
Dun waste time n effort if no stack  for car drivers,btohqsg
Stack two bike jobs oso better than take one car job sometimes,btohqsg
How do i change my mode of transport? In-app cs?,btohqsg
It's not a new pattern. It was under their tnc and training I think you didn't notice.,btohqsg
Stacking was unofficially allowed last time.. but some drivers of course spoil market.. their eyes became wider when they saw the +++... stacked and then late.. of course vendors complain their food late..So... it is only us drivers who are to blame for no more stacking..,btohqsg
Fully agreed saw some drivers stack 3 order from 3 diff restaurant to 3 location in north side. Cfm late one,btohqsg
That 1 not as jialat as what I saw. Driver stack 3 orders. From 3 diff restaurant  drop off 2 at East Side 1 at West Side. üò≥üò≥üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Hello I‚Äôm checking if anyone is interested in promoting my products on carousel  and get a pay of $$300 24 hours after postingPm if interested,btohqsg
If so good.... who still need to do lalamove,btohqsg
ask you guys..for cash orders  should client make payment first before we pick up?,btohqsg
i always check with them if payment at pick up or drop off. if they say payment at drop off  dont complete the order and press cash collected until they pay,btohqsg
Always collect money at the pickup point b4 start delivery or make sure the money has been transferred to ur account b4 the last drop off point...Reason... LLM policy to collect payment b4 finish delivery. Example.. if pay by credit card.. payment made b4 delivery.. so cash payment is the same also.. NO Difference tell the customer.Better to protect urself than having to waste time chasing customer or contacting CS for payment..,btohqsg
But sometime reach pickup point customer tell us to collect from receiver,btohqsg
Anyway I had quit LLM   totally not worth it,btohqsg
Work as pt if happen to go that area then ok,btohqsg
Yes..  so u contact the receiver and tell them u are on the way but pls transfer the money as it is LLM policy to collect money b4 deliver.. if not LLM will take it out my pocket if i dun follow this policy.. something like tat.. at the end the day.. u want to make sure he pays up and not run away after delivery...,btohqsg
Yeah   but I met people who are old + talking to them need waste more time.,btohqsg
Then dun deliver until payment made..  simple.,btohqsg
Hehe we in losing end   waste trip to pickup point or waiting for payment to be made then we got delay for delivering and get suspend etc etc  anyway i stopped Just sharing my point.,btohqsg
Well.. to each own.. try to chase a customer for payment or ask CS to chase.. then one lagi waste of time...Cannot be delay delivery for more than one hour right.. if he is paying for the item.. he will be kanchiong to receive the item he paid for.. if he is willing to pay $200 for the item.. he will be kanchiong to quickly pay the $20 delivery fee so he get it faster..I have no problem w payment when i explain to them payment b4 delivery..,btohqsg
Very hard to bio jobs. See until eyes pain lol,btohqsg
raining time all on grab n gojek n ride n tada...this is how they earn..for those no grab no gojek no tada no ride..100% cannot make it...how to cover..,btohqsg

Hi guys . I just accepted a order for tmrw . But seem like I got 2 orders at same timing.  Is it possible to cancle 1 of the order ?,btohqsg
alternatively  ask someone to do for you. For the order that the other person is doing  that person will need to login your account to swipe pickup and take picture. The key importance is for the GPS to detect the pickup pin drop so that u dont get love letter,btohqsg
Want to do then pm..if dont want...or think not worth..then just mind own business dont need talk much.,btohqsg
Both of u serve a purpose...in the corporate world  one's an employer while the other is Unionü§≠üòÄ,btohqsg
Hi  may i know what‚Äôs the problem here? Took this job yesterday for this morning. User cancel half hr before job. User repost  my friend with a car account can see the repost but I can‚Äôt.,btohqsg
The problem is i cant see the orders anymore. Its like they somehow hide the orders. I also dunno what i did wrong. Hahahhaa,btohqsg
Yes rider. The order for motorcycle,btohqsg
If the customer change to car  then if ur rider acct u cannot see the car job is normal,btohqsg
They order bike order  but only want car to take it,btohqsg

Hey  looks like I'll be stopping full-time Lalamove for now. Found a job and I'll be starting on 1 December. Thanks for the sharing and I benefit greatly from all the sharing here. I sincerely wish all of you the best  and most importantly  stay safe as a Lalamove driver. I'll still do one or two Lalamove deliveries once a month because I want to keep that 20% fuel discount. üòÇ,btohqsg
Finally  do go to MyCareersFuture website. That's where I found my job. The government will even pay you $3800 if you work under SGUP program. So if you are doing LLM as an interim solution  go there now.,btohqsg

Bro  to clarify. I go to that website  I applied many jobs  got 3 interviews. 2 are for SGUP and I moved on to 2nd round of interview. At this time  I got the offer to work as full time not under SGUP where my take home is about $3800 after CPF. So yeah  I got a good offer even as a non degree. So I rejected the SGUP program. But for you  it can be a really good deal.So let's appreciate our government ok? üòÇ,btohqsg

The 106 is buggy  open then 5 sec later shutdown,btohqsg
there was once i took a job from MBS to Westgate. 4 cartons. forgot to bring trolley so i have to carry one by one from the shop to the car and the car to the shop.i went in and out of MBS 4 times to avoid paying parking charges. Knowing where the shop is and where to park in MBS also impt. need to do homework before going in.but for Westgate its about $1.20-$1.40 so thats ok.,btohqsg
The shop doesn't have trolley to loan you?,btohqsg
that time tempted cos car job and it was about $25,btohqsg
lesson learnt is that next time see job properly before swiping,btohqsg
the reason why so few car jobs. why waste money to book car?,btohqsg

Lalamove ballot system should include distance from pickup as a factor too,btohqsg
As long as within 30 mins the driver goes to you  why would you bother? You expect within 5 mins the driver comes to you?,btohqsg

Problem not the driver  it's Lalamove,btohqsg
Just now I saw using my driver app 3 people ballot  they should prioritize those who are nearer to the pickup,btohqsg
It does prioritise those who are nearer to get the job  however those drivers who are near may not want to take your job  you see.,btohqsg
3 people ballot  the one who is nearest to the pickup location will get the job.,btohqsg

This is by Lalamove themselves and not any vendor it seems,btohqsg
