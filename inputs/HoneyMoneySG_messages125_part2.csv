With the new exclusions  refusal to waive annual fees (even for near 100k spends)  I think SCB might be dying and trying to cut cost. But lol  they will just suffer,btohqsg
More like they dont need customers in their credit card segments and choose to focus on other businesses.,btohqsg
Trying to be objective here.I think it is wise not to troll and intentionally state wrong instructions  even if to punish lazy people who don't read.,btohqsg
For HSBC Bonus Interest Campaign:I'm putting it out here that  it is the first 9 digits (as always).And this is as per T&C posted here.Admins may remove misinformation postsEdit: add picture,btohqsg
Doubt so. CC is always an easy avenue to early extra money for people with poor financial decisions ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
"I think some of us did had a good laugh from the trolling ðŸ˜‚Btw may i ask for EGA bonus interest  generally do you guys get the bonus interest according to the time line as stated in the tnc?  I got a line stating ""EVERYDAY+ BONUS INTEREST"" on 5th July when i only opened account and deposit on 12th Jun for the June promo. May I ask what is this item?",btohqsg
That's for Everyday+. Bonus interest usually is by the end of month  2 months after registration month. Can check t&c for info.,btohqsg

Anyone has appeal through for paynow sala for uob one saving before? Forgot to transfer in for July ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
is yours a fake or real transfer,btohqsg
u can try but i would think it is hardone of my humans managed to appeal successfully a real salary when the company paid salary twice in november and didn't pay in december anymore (something like early salary),btohqsg
and somemore i guess u are appealing 2 things:1. salary crediting2. bonus interest payment (this might be even harder),btohqsg
Yeap  I called in earlier. They said it's easy if it's real Giro salary but harder for paynow sala. CS told me to paynow twice now and then to see if can appeal through,btohqsg
Wah the CS is very accommodating. And they are clearly aware of people doing this :),btohqsg
Yep  will update in here I managed to get it done so next time people can try. Quite significant amount since I am getting the max interest on 150k. Without the salary  Interest became 10% of what I was supposed to get ðŸ˜©,btohqsg
yeah they need to cater for 'genuine' cases like parent paying a full time child or hawker paying dish washer?these days after covid.. a lot of freelance work,btohqsg
"Yeap I did mention that I am ""freelancer"" hahaha",btohqsg

Does red mart on Lazada give us 4mpd for hsbc revolution? According to Hermax itâ€™s 0.4mpd or it shall be categorised as spend on Lazada? Since we are using Lazada apps to buy online,btohqsg
Yes but it doesnâ€™t categorize as 5311 as Lazada?,btohqsg
5411  not 5311 so you won't get 4mpd,btohqsg
Ya the same app can give different mcc depending on what you are buying from them,btohqsg
hi  for uob one card  is the quarter spending calculation based on the statement date? or is it based on the card approval date?,btohqsg
Lazada has multiple MCC and sometimes different MCC for the same item,btohqsg
that means if i change the statement date  the calculation period will be shorten/extended?,btohqsg

If I received $0.11 of interest on 31st July for my E Saver account  does it mean my ADB for July 2024 = SGD264?actually i expected $1 ADB  since I kept $1 most of the time!!!,btohqsg
errrr... ok i don't understand how $1 ADB in July 2024 will get 11 cents of interest.. but whatever....,btohqsg
lol  good that u earn a few cents extra,btohqsg
Let me explain my strategy why I care about this.Because August is a weekend ending month. 31st August is a Saturday. 1st September is a Sunday.This is particularly important for HSBC EGA due to $250k daily transfer limits.So I will make sure I move out my HSBC EGA funds into my $1 Esaver such that my HSBC EGA is empty ($2000) on 30th August. All the funds sitting in Esaver.Then only move the funds from Esaver on 2nd September (Monday) onwards into the second human's HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
