Card spend bonus comes in on 1st working day of following calendar month  lady's account bonus comes in 27th of following calendar month,btohqsg
Card spend is x9 or x5 for eligible spend,btohqsg
supposed to be 9X by calculation but in the app it says 5X,btohqsg
the 5X i see is from savings bonus. Card spend bonus don't specify how many X  only says Lady's Card UNI$,btohqsg
Omg why I don’t see lady card UNI,btohqsg
Wow I’m not seeing that credited to me at all and I did chose the correct category,btohqsg
How long have u had the card? What cat did you choose?,btohqsg
But previously I got lady card and not solitaire,btohqsg
So I got two . I sus the system locks my lady card,btohqsg
i think upgrade in categories only take effect in new quarter. You better double check with CSO.,btohqsg
Yeah I double check it before,btohqsg
Is it possible for Cso to refund miles?,btohqsg
That's for UOB to answer you haha,btohqsg
As in if yall have any experience,btohqsg
When did u get approved for lady sol? And have you been receiving miles for basic lady?,btohqsg
Mid June   and yes I have been receiving miles for basic lady,btohqsg
You won’t receive bonus miles for your second category for spending in June,btohqsg
That new category only comes into effect July  which is the start of a new quarter,btohqsg
Cso told me solitaire will supersede normal lady in June,btohqsg
Only the limit of $2000. Categories come into effect quarterly only,btohqsg
So if my normal lady is travel in June and if my solitaire when I apporve I put dining and fashion,btohqsg
https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/faqs-final.pdfWhat happens when I upgrade my UOB Lady’s Classic/ Platinum/ World Mastercard to UOB Lady’s Solitaire Card?Please visituob.com.sg/ladys-enrolto choose TWO (2) of your preferred rewards categories. This will take effect the next calendar quarter. However  you may start enjoying the higher cap of S$2 000 spend based on your existing chosen ONE (1) preferred rewards category in the calendar month of your card upgrade.,btohqsg
Bonus miles only for travel related spend in June. Dining and fashion from July onwards  unfortunately,btohqsg
And I spend on my solitaire   it is dining fashion or travel,btohqsg
You don't get any bonus for your spending on dining and fashion in June,btohqsg
oh myyyyy I called CSO and he said can,btohqsg
The card will take over  the limit will change  just not the categories,btohqsg
DId you take a screenshot/recording of what CSO said to you?  If you did  maybe can try to appeal but if not  then too bad.,btohqsg
I now got UOB lady N UOB solitaire should I cancel my UOB lady?,btohqsg
I thought for TWD  it is better to get from money changer as their rate is better at 24.50 compared to youtrip  amaze  Ichange etc?,btohqsg
Yall more reliable than CSO sia,btohqsg
Rely on tncs better than CSO,btohqsg
There's a lot of dp here on UOB CSOs  read t&c better. On black and white  the outcome can be better but cannot be worse.,btohqsg
It should be cancelled automatically. But if not  you can just do the cancellation via the UOB app.Also  take note of the expiry month of your solitaire card. That’ll be the month your annual fees are charged so you wanna be careful about your Uni$,btohqsg
Can advice me on this  I didn’t upgrade I applied solitaire hence I got two card,btohqsg
For the citi bank smrt card  is using apple pay to tap at the gantry to enter MRT eligible for cashback? Or must I use the physical card?,btohqsg
is the citi rewards + instarem combo the best for general spend or is there a better card out there ?,btohqsg
How do I check my UOB solitaire category ?,btohqsg
Think there’s a chat bot you can check with,btohqsg
Can any master advice how much in total is the surrender value for this?,btohqsg
Yes if your spending is below 1k. And dont buy travel tix.,btohqsg
about 4 225.75 - fees and non guaranteed amount,btohqsg
Ic.. So those bonus alr inclusive,btohqsg
what is not detailed in your screenshot.. is the SURRENDER FEE/CHARGE,btohqsg
Does CIMB really have this fixed deposit plan?,btohqsg
Current grosssurrender value is in your screenshot  about 4.2k.Product summary and benefit illustration will tell you more info on your guaranteed and non-guaranteed bonuses. As well as the fees.,btohqsg
it is likely a STRUCTURED DEPOSIT,btohqsg
and they are 'eating' you on year 1.5 to 2.5...you only get 3% p.a. on $300k,btohqsg
Hi Chris@ChrisHMSG  may I check if longbridge have any MMF to subscribe to? else 90 days $$ standing there  is not productive,btohqsg
Ohh ok! Tks for the reply  just worried it is a scam or something.,btohqsg
