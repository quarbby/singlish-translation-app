okay not exactly  i dont agree with the bad influence (partly bc my class is studious)  i feel the people there is either a hit or miss  but it sounds like you didn't hit. Older teachers love to yap  but they generally cannot teach well. MI their opportunities are only open to very good students academically  the rest they dc. Then during htp the year head sometimes may be damn asshole  shout at the cohort for not doing well and then make us 'reflect' (typical K+OH-). I agree skipping lessons cases is rising  the sc alr address it  but nothing has been done so far  hence sc = useless. The no grace time period is because the teachers also say got some people from previous cohort live in johor and can come early everyday ik damn stupid  grace time only for bad weather or jam. The caifan and noodz not worth  but the indian food i feel quite okay.,btohqsg

Library more spaces : who pay for the reno then?Library open longer : librarian dont need go home? They already work from 8am to 6pmSchool notes better : thats very subjective. How much better should it be? Everything you need to know are in the notes. The rest needs to come from your understandingNight study : manpower come from where? Teachers dont need go home to their family?,btohqsg
If mi world we would have worn cold clothes,btohqsg
