Funny how last time Merc number corresponds to engine size.Like 220 = 2200cc  260E = 2600ccThen we have odd ones like 190E with 1.8L all the way to 2.6L (inline 6  not cosworth)Then we had 300SEL (W108) with 6.3L V8.But nowadays the numbers are more like inhouse performance ratings rather than actual cc.(A45S 2L engine LOL),btohqsg
darn they killed the V8 and halfed it!,btohqsg
