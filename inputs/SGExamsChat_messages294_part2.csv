1st point: young people have newer ideas and different perspectives to solve issues (eg. malala)2nd point: young people can use social media etc. to influence others (my eg. was the oxygen donation to India on Instagram)counter-argument(bc i thought it was argumentative): idk what was it but my eg. was school shooting(most of the aggressors are students/youth)rebuttal: young people can educate older generation,btohqsg
