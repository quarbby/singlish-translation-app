They will probably be happy because you're giving them free tax relief.. and you'll be happy to be able to continue to pay your premiums.. The only cost is you'll be locking up cash into MA  which you could possibly put into T-bills for some safe interest. Really depends on what you want and if your children is ok to help you.,btohqsg

sounds interesting  will check that strat out haha thanks!,btohqsg
max $1k reward cap though  on 2.5k spend it's equal to general cashback card,btohqsg
If u clock on lady u can fulfill spend criteria for uob one bonus interest if u have full 100k in it for apr or 150k in may,btohqsg

Is there any t&c for 10% on simplygo txns?,btohqsg
You can read UOB One card's tnc for the whole card itself,btohqsg
that is part of the journeyneed effort to play miles and cashback game effectively.,btohqsg
Yea I agree. Human get more satisfactory only after some hardwork and everyone spending is different not easy 1 way fit all,btohqsg
Quarterly fee  2.18 per counter if not mistaken,btohqsg
You gotta work for it. Sometimes you'll realise you'll only use the card for a year and then you'll need to change the entire strategy with multiple different cards.,btohqsg
Hello. Wanted to solicit some advice. I'm going to be living in UK for a year. Does it make sense to (1) apply for a UK credit card (likely cashback since I likely can't clock enough miles meaningfully in a year) or (2) spend on a Singapore credit card (likely using instarem amaze)?,btohqsg
If keep cancelling and changing the cards  is there any impact to credit rating?,btohqsg
Don't cancel.. just use a different card?,btohqsg

For retirees (aged 55 and above) with no income  they have 3 options  (1) secured CCs by having FD as collateral  (2) have a total of net personal assets exceeding 750k  (3) guarantor with a minimum income of 30k.Credit limits for (1) will be based on FD  (2) will be tiered based net personal assets (750k/2m)  (3) income of guarantor.For retirees (below age 55) with no income  they can also have (1) as an option. Additionally  net personal assets above 2m or net financial assets above 1m.,btohqsg

Hi everyone!I need some advice on which credit card to use for a Shopee purchase. I'm looking at getting a camera for around $3k. I've got the HSBC Revolution  Citi Rewards  OCBC 365  and UOB Lady's Card.I‚Äôm leaning more towards earning miles than cashback.Which card do you think works best for this? Thanks for your help!,btohqsg
They are not always right. A lot of time they don‚Äôt know what they are saying,btohqsg
This cso talking nonsense. Cut her off. Try another cso,btohqsg
More like always not right ü§°,btohqsg
Empty amaze wallet won‚Äôt tell if Agoda is under Travel category for UOB Lady‚Äôs üòÖ,btohqsg
That's the bank's own rules. MAS regulation does not require.,btohqsg
True but you can check mcc and description. Will roughly tell you if will be counted or not.Heymax.aiis the easiest way.,btohqsg
Have you triedheymax.ai? It's a great tool to find out what's the best card or cards eligible for your spend.,btohqsg
For example  I know from ML which things under Travel. But if you refer to TnC  there‚Äôs no info about which MCCs are under Travel.Heymax yes  but not empty amaze wallet,btohqsg
Yup  they only provide a vague description. That's why best to check againstheymax.ai.,btohqsg
Still empty amaze wallet is useless for checking if it‚Äôs under Travel,btohqsg
the cso is saying mcc 4722:  travel agency is not under travel  lol.,btohqsg
You can get MCC and check against other merchants with the same MCC onheymax.ai  if it somehow doesn't exist in their database. Not entirely useless.,btohqsg
Most of the time we use amaze + empty wallet. Get the mcc to be 4772 or 7011 and we know it‚Äôs safe for Travel (pun intended),btohqsg
Heymax.aistates 4722 as well. Unlessheymax.aiis not accurate anymore. ü§°,btohqsg
5309 is also under travel. But again  Amaze will give you MCC  but won‚Äôt tell you if it‚Äôs under Travel Category for UOB Lady‚Äôs. Even TnC of UOB Lady‚Äôs won‚Äôt tell you that. You need more tools and sources (or test and see),btohqsg
yea  the issue here is a cso giving rubbish answer. Anyway knowing the mcc or being listed in heymax does not help justify whether uob give bonus points or not.,btohqsg
He isn‚Äôt making a statement  ‚Äúlol‚Äù refers to smth else üòÇ,btohqsg

What is a good Kris credit card to go for at the moment,btohqsg

Guys  do you buy travel insurance if your credit card already have complimentary insurance? I use the hsbc revolution card to book my flight so is it advisable to buy a travel insurance?,btohqsg
The coverage offered by credit card tends to be quite minimal  you might want to look at what's offered by your card first,btohqsg
"https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/credit-cards/revolution/travel-insurance.pdfAssuming this is the one that you're looking at  I will say... some things like Medical expenses and maybe definition of ""Loss of luggage"" could differ. Try reading the terms abit and u will see what i mean",btohqsg
End of day  travel insurance (at least to me) is to get peace of mind. If the free one can covers what you think is sufficient then go ahead.. if not  purchase one so u won't travel with a worried mind :),btohqsg

the non guaranteed Surrender Value does appear to increase by 8-10% pa!!!!,btohqsg
u got account for the 46.7 i have to pay monthly ??,btohqsg
ok maybe 6% p.a. then.. that's still pretty decent,btohqsg
Maybe I suggest this   you see if make sense.Keep holding this policy as long as the annual announced (confirm) surrender value is close to the projections. The moment they don't pay as projected  you surrender it (it can't drop below last year's announced value anyway).,btohqsg
lolol wtf this strategy actually sounds quite legit  might consider it myself üòÇ,btohqsg
but HOR i have this policy for 25 years le... so alot is from BOOONUS,btohqsg
well we sort of concluded.. yes the 3.6% p.a. over the last 25 years is so so only.. but because global interest rates were low anyway.Now yes  rates are higher (but might drop)  if they can pay you 6% p.a. ish.. why not right?if you terminate  you still get to keep the bonuses declared right?,btohqsg
dk is it for all customer,btohqsg
actually based on my calculation its about 5.5% pa which is decently high enough if the projected total is correct. currently jumping at 2% a month i think could really hit the projected total even if the fees are significantly higher than other policies. probably need to wait a year to verify since i just got this policy,btohqsg

I would have thought so but my friend just told me that she received an email from UOB on her application submitted through UOB TMRW  the officer was requesting for her employment details which she does not have. She wasn't sure why UOB was requesting her employment details even though she has already placed a secured FD...,btohqsg
Just reply homemaker or unemployed  depending what her situation is,btohqsg
Ask her tell the bank officer that she already has secured FD. Not all bank staffs can access all your confidential records.,btohqsg
ok will let her know accordingly. thank you all for the advice!,btohqsg
Have. I just bought with amaze + crmc. $100 get $110 total.,btohqsg
Am thinking of redeeming ssb. Any different between redeeming now vs end of month since the funds will only be returned to bank early next month?,btohqsg
no difference at all...unless you might change your mind,btohqsg
means likely not received yet?I applied and have gotten application # almost immediately,btohqsg
i applied twice for 2 diff cards and there is no number for me at all,btohqsg
best to check with citi  do you have an existing citi account?can try to use their live chat function  they usually get back within a day!,btohqsg
Reason for asking is im thinking of shifting funds from ssb to syfe cash+ guaranteed. Just wondering  in the future when interest rates get lower  how will cash+ rates change?,btohqsg
If u think rates dropping. Don‚Äôt sell ssb. Locked in rates for 10 years.,btohqsg
Was trying to read up on it and i thought when interest rates go down  bond interest goes up. And now we are in a kinda high interest rate environment so if anything  itll likely go down in the future?,btohqsg
Hi  how long does it usually takes for cc  bill payment to process using DBS credit card as the payment source ?,btohqsg
Hi! If I make payment by instalments on my DBS woman‚Äôs card and UOB woman‚Äôs card  will I still earn the full miles?,btohqsg
Hi all  just received the Amaze Instarem card and applied the UOB Prvi Miles (visa). Amaze cannot pair up with UOB Prvi? I tried and they said only mastercardüò≠,btohqsg
Hello all  i would like to ask what is the best payment strategy for overseas payment for grocery payment  shopping and transport (deutsche bahn) expenses in germany and france? Is the instarem wallet better or youtrip better?,btohqsg
hopefully as US rate cuts delayed will also delay further interest rate cuts by local banks. I just bought US 10y at 4.5%,btohqsg
Amaze is Mastercard only. Can still cancel?,btohqsg
Installments by bank don't for rewards.,btohqsg
Are there any revolut sign up promotion?,btohqsg
Nothing much different for overseas purchases  other than adding amaze. Can refer to this videohttps://youtu.be/Kkkg1o_eWvo?si=LWCf3_YWIL_IdeyT,btohqsg
We do not discuss that here,btohqsg
interest rates go down  bond price goes up. Not bond interest,btohqsg
"Fr investopedia ""Most bonds pay a fixed interest rate that becomes more attractive if interest rates fall  driving up demand and the price of the bond. Conversely  if interest rates rise  investors will no longer prefer the lower fixed interest rate paid by a bond  resulting in a decline in its price.""",btohqsg
Thanks  no current promotion right? Nothing mentioned,btohqsg
US$250k for 10y. have other shorter dated,btohqsg
And if using syfe cash+  the only option is to hold till maturity and so there should be minimal impact by interest rate momements?,btohqsg
when interest rates move down  bond prices increase (becos more pple buying to seek better return)  which then drives down bond yields,btohqsg
How sensitive would bond interests be from money market funds in such scenarios?,btohqsg
Money market funds will just pay less interest as they are often invested in short term products like fixed deposits and Tbills.Ie they will not benefit from falling interest rates.,btohqsg
Hello! I am currently pairing Citi rewards with amaze. But the 1k domestic spend nerf will limit my spending. What would be a good combo with Citi rewards card now?,btohqsg
Would they also be less affected by falling interest rates? Since these are short term products?,btohqsg
No. They are totally affected by changing interest rates because they have underlyings that are short term and need to be constantly renewed at prevailing interest rates.,btohqsg
May i know currently which cc offer free to airport lounge yearly aside fr citi primer miles ?,btohqsg
citi rewards 4mpd is limited to $1k in statement month. Not elaborate further what issue u facing?,btohqsg
Dept store doesn‚Äôt need to pair with Amaze,btohqsg
Would anyone know how and when HSBC ega giro interests are paid? Thank you.,btohqsg
The rebate comes in 1 day after your giro is deducted from ega,btohqsg
What are examples of bonds  we can buy? E.g. SSB buy/sell at same value  once locked in it is not affected by interest rate movements. Thank you,btohqsg
Hi  a follow up to this‚Ä¶ am overseas now and am using CRxAmaze for spending‚Ä¶ if i have past 1k spending  would it be more beneficial to use OCBC n90? N90 will have 1.3mpd in $5 blocks  but CR after 1k is 0.4mpd is that correct‚Ä¶?I know UOB lady‚Äôs is beneficial. But I do not have UOB lady‚Äôs card unfortunately as of now,btohqsg
SSB redemption can be done in partial  need pay $2 admin fee and there is a specific window period to redeem.Once locked in  the fixed interest payout,btohqsg
For local  SSBFor US  Can look at US Treasury as an  example (for illustration purpose only)https://fund-upgrowth.sg.moomoo.com/fego/us_treasuries_v3,btohqsg
I wouldn't use any cards less than 2 mpd/2.5% cashback with amaze  the fee isn't worth it,btohqsg
Ocbc365 seems like there isn't any promotion on new sign up. Should I wait for a promotion or just signup,btohqsg
Thanks Chris. Appreciate the advice. Then will likely change to use my youtrip/trust card. Appreciate the advice/insights as always!,btohqsg
Then again if you're using it to clock OCBC 360 spend criteria  I think it's okay to use it despite the fees *assuming you need to make effort to hit it*,btohqsg
I wonder if I applied UOB credit card overseas  and I apply UOB credit card here  would I still qualify for the sign up bonuses,btohqsg
Different country  different entity and rules. You will qualify,btohqsg
Apply now if you want to use to clock 360 ACC  if not just wait for promo. As someone who recently cancelled ocbc365  got to say this card is not worth using after all the nerf. You have to hit min $800 spend per month  no bonus cashback on 5814 where majority of food places use  pharmacy only limited to Watson  no more travel category. After spending $800 per month  I only got around $30 cashback,btohqsg
FairPrice Zhongshan told me they stopped selling gift cards already.,btohqsg
Any good card to replace it instead as i have 360 saving acc,btohqsg
Seems like only US treasuries may benefit from interest rate cut and may increase in price. For local SSB  you get what you once locked in. Thank you.,btohqsg
That's why I said get it if you want to clock the 360 acc bonus interest  there's additional cashback there,btohqsg
If not UOB evol can get $40 for $600 spend,btohqsg
Sorry but wanna know how does buying shopback vouchers work for ocbc 360 card?,btohqsg

Anybody knows if I‚Äôm a young SEP and my CPF hit BHS and FRS: can I still VC3A into my CPF up to $37740? The excess will flow into OA? Will I still be eligible for tax relief with VC3A this way.,btohqsg
It's 37% of your Net trade income. So vc3a up to $37 740 if only you declared $102k NTIhttps://youtu.be/9BE-3QaOc7k?si=TWR_cgAzg1QfiHK5,btohqsg
So no issues even though I‚Äôve already hit FRS and BHS ya? Won‚Äôt refund. And will probably overflow into OA,btohqsg
SA will stay in SA. Only MA will flow to OA.,btohqsg
I may be wrong but For self employed  vc3a and vcma both contribute to the same cap from my experience. RSTU-SA no issue,btohqsg
Hi my citi credit card bill is due tomorrow. Bank transfer from another bank needs about 2 working days  any other way to pay by today so that it is reflected before the due date?,btohqsg
Why does it take a few days to receive the payment is received email?,btohqsg
I mean like after I do a fast transfer via ocbc bank to pay the citi credit card bill  they only record my payment about 2 working days on the app and send an email that they have received the payment,btohqsg
For HSBC ega  understand the term financial institution is very vague. Does anyone have any idea if giro payment to another bank for car loan will be nerfed?,btohqsg
u sure u paying via FAST?,btohqsg
only crypto/shares related excluded according to cso  need to test in May,btohqsg
About HSBC EGA Giro  I think we all shall stop calling CSO. There is not much we can change. Just need to wait for May and check our account to see what are included and what are excluded.,btohqsg
Did u transfer on public holiday or weekend?,btohqsg

SSB is not a real bond.Thanks to the special feature of being able to sell back to government at 100 anytime AS WELL AS not being free market tradeable  the price of SSB will not change. It is always at 100%.You CANNOT PROFIT OR LOSE on SSB principal. Locked at 100%.Unlike you buy UST or normal bonds. If interest rates drop  your bond price can shoot up.,btohqsg

Hi guys! my CRMC billing cycle is currently 5th of each month. CSO informed that the available dates to change to are only 10th or 15th of the month.If my intention is for it to be aligned to the calendar month as much as possible (for ease of tracking the $1k spend bonus cap together with Amaze local 1k spend cap)  would 5th be the best option? thank you!also  the CSO informed that all other dates are maxed out - so does this mean that other dates may open up after awhile? will anyone be able to advise please. the CSO said that they cannot advise on that. Thank you!,btohqsg
For nets auto top up  no workaround right? Haha,btohqsg
Doesn't matter if not aligned. CRMC 1k cap is based on statement month not calendar month,btohqsg
oh sorry! to clarify  want to align it for pairing with Amaze $1k local spend based on calendar month,btohqsg
as in alternative is just use simplygo,btohqsg
Hi guys  wanna quickly clear this doubt. I‚Äôm using citibank rewards + amaze at the moment  was wondering if i dine out on restaurants/cafe  am i entitled to 4mpd if i pay using citi rewards? Or should i use amaze? üòÖ,btohqsg
nope. Need to use Amaze to pay and ensure it links to your citi rewards credit card.,btohqsg

Hi all.. can I check Amaze can't linked to apple pay or Samsung pay?,btohqsg
Not yet. Instarem person during Seedly finance festival said apple pay will be up in next 1-2 months. Android can google pay amaze,btohqsg
eagerly awaiting... then easier to share amaze cards !,btohqsg
But we can use paywave on Amaze right?,btohqsg
They have no intention to add to Samsung Pay is it?,btohqsg
Can I check if I use instarem physical to pay using paywave. Is that consider contactless payment? Will it affect with citi reward?,btohqsg
Also CIMB Visa invinite 4 lounges per year,btohqsg
use Amaze card linked to citi rewards card is online to citi rewards card,btohqsg
Unlikely. They need to register for partnership with Samsung and it's up to Samsung to keep them also,btohqsg

I received a call from Moomoo today. (First time ever). And the person wants to share Whatsapp with me..,btohqsg

I think I'll do with the screenshot,btohqsg
It's normal but for safety sake  i always contact customer service directly through the app instead of whatsapp,btohqsg
Yea I just want to be safe.,btohqsg
Dunno about yours  but Moomoo really did call me. To introduce herself in case I needed help etc. Same  also WA verified number,btohqsg
"Hi everyone  have a question. Webull has a ""earn up to 3 000USD cash voucher for bonus 3% of NCD promotion"". Am I right to say that if i deposit etc 10k and just put into sgd cash fund approx 3.5% per annum interest  thats 3.5%+3% = so effectively 6.5% per annum if i leave it there for 1 year of course the sgd cash fund rates might go down but assuming it stays around 3.5% is there anything im missing because guaranteed 6.5% sounds a little too good to be true. sorry my girlmath failing mee üôÅ",btohqsg

Nope. Karina. But long time ago.,btohqsg

Ahh okk. Never experience this when I had 150k in moomoo previously.. but suddenly got rope in when I only have 25k in moomoo now.. thus the precautions,btohqsg
Maybe they are triggered by your declining funds?,btohqsg

Hello  is WeChat pay sufficient or better to have both WeChat and AliPay to use in China?,btohqsg

Need give heads up to bank anot ah? Saw a few errors previously across different chat and I only got Alipay Soo,btohqsg
I rather u find a good friend in Hong Kong. Can be your backup and send you rmb into your Alipay or WeChat pay if u have trouble.,btohqsg
Both need identification verification if u want full features.,btohqsg
But both work the same by adding your credit card to pay right?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt do that method so I won‚Äôt comment. I know foreign cards have fees.I use China bank account method.,btohqsg
Another common method my friends use is to get rmb from China friends.They need sgd and u need rmb. So if your china friend visits. U give them SGD cash. They credit your Alipay.,btohqsg
I setup Alipay and WeChat in case any of one of them got issues. I used trust credit card cos of fx savings. Last year  there was a promo on SC Journey card and I added that. But this year  they didn‚Äôt extend the promo. I guess for now I will use trust credit card,btohqsg

Hi all. I have 2 questions regarding UOB Lady's Card...1) Understand that UNI$ are rewarded per $5 dollar blocks. If I were to buy a drink from McDonalds for $2.50 and another drink from KFC $2.50. Does this add up to a single $5.00 block?2) Is there a way to track the spending per category so I know when to switch to another card when the cap is hit (e.g.  $1 000 for dining).,btohqsg
Also  I understand the FX rate for Amaze is not exactly the best. So  does it make sense to use Amaze + 1.5% Cash Back card overseas? Or should I just use Wise/Youtrip and miss out on credit card rewards?,btohqsg
1) no‚Ä¶ it is per transaction2) use excel to track   unless u are very sure then u use the bank app transaction to see,btohqsg
So no point to use UOB Lady card for F&B spending less than $5.00 right,btohqsg

Oh how do you do that? I recently lost and found my Citi prestige. Need to cancel,btohqsg
Once bank issue new card  old one is cancelled already. Presume bank issued card with new number,btohqsg
Yup how to destroy the old card,btohqsg
Hi everyone! I am currently paying SP utilities through UOB Amex card. After the nerf  I was thinking of switching to another card.I saw the Maybank Platinum Visa Card and was thinking of using it for my insurance payments as well as utilities  but am confused by this part. I'm aiming for the $30 cashback.They say that maximum monthly spend on insurance is $150  and insurance only counts as half payment.1) So does this mean monthly I can only spend $150 or is it $300 on insurance?2) Are there any other cards that can cover both insurance and utilities payment?Thank you in advance!,btohqsg
Hi All  has anyone recently tried adding new cards to Instarem Amaze and got this message? trying to add my UOB cards but unable to,btohqsg
Monthly only 150 on insurance will count toward the cashback,btohqsg
Ahhh I see. Are there any other cards that can be used for both insurance and utilities that you can recommend?,btohqsg
You can use cardup to bypass the exclusion at a fee (still net positive for cashback).,btohqsg
Does anyone here use the standard chartered smart credit card just fr simplygo?,btohqsg
Hmmm interesting   dbs wwmc refused to waive my annual fee,btohqsg
Yeah known issue with Uob cards and amaze recently. Both parties pushing to each other with no solution yet.,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtdid they waive ur wwmc fees? üòï,btohqsg
I also didn‚Äôt manage to get it waived last year and I proceeded to cancel.,btohqsg
For those paying insurance premiums etc  are there specific banks or cards that allow u to have rebates/Cashback or clock as expenses,btohqsg
Is it worth still fr the cashback if just use for simplygo mthly in your opinion?,btohqsg
Wah even u couldnt get it  so i guess they gave him some special privileges even tho he didnt manage to meet the min spending. UOB is a much nicer bank than DBS,btohqsg
In the past I used to get it waived  only last year they decided to be annoying haha. But good riddance  I realised I don‚Äôt really need that card in my wallet.,btohqsg

2k for $13.5k better than strike toto,btohqsg

I think got catch coz got *,btohqsg
1 share refers to 1 chance according to this table - i.e. you could just get 15 x USD10 with 15 chances,btohqsg

@kelvintaninvestcovered this before on his channel,btohqsg
Yes i saw  seems very good offer hmmm,btohqsg
Umm how is it a good offer? Technically you are taking the risk of the property with fixed upside and while there is a guarantee  there is no guarantee the guarantor will pay up,btohqsg
Urgent: Hi guys  UOB krisflyer card  can book tickets for parents?,btohqsg
Why not? But is sia flight right,btohqsg
Scoot flight üôÇ so is via the UOB Scoot portal for free baggage for them,btohqsg

Yes a bit of change. Just want the baggage lor haha. 5kg free,btohqsg
? Whats the guarantor for if it doesn't guarantee the payment?,btohqsg
I'm saying i don't know if the guarantor has the capacity to repay in an event of default.,btohqsg
As always  better not to invest if u are not comfortable with the risks. Got way easier to understand investment than this,btohqsg
Hi   monthly  i use debit card or nets / netsflash play / grab pay to pay 600 dollor for my kids music school . How can i can get the cash back or miles ?  they are not accept credit card or bank transfer .  Only accept paynow use UEN No. Thanks,btohqsg

Hi all  I'm having difficulty linking my UOB prvi miles to amaze card. Anyone faced the same issue,btohqsg
I suggest you refer to the card's t&c instead.,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows how long must I stay with GIGA before I can port out to another telco?,btohqsg
I know but feel so less cash back üòÄ. Anyway thanks for your advice.,btohqsg
0.3% is higher than 0%. When they accept GIRO payments then look at HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
If your contract is the type that has no contractual period  should be able to port out anytime. Check your contract if it has any minimum term,btohqsg
Giga is good  why to port out,btohqsg
GPay pay to UEN  random cashback up to 2 times a week. GXS Debit min. $10  random reward  few cents to few dollars.,btohqsg
Trust Debit 0.22% in linkpoints. Can clock 5 transactions per month for additional 0.5% on Savings account  total 2.0% for non-Union member.,btohqsg
Which method is good for huge credit card payments? Thanks,btohqsg
U are doing micro financing. Not worth the risk in my opinion,btohqsg
The risk level is not on par with ssb/fd/tbills,btohqsg
Ya  I second this‚Ä¶ tried a few previously. Currently Giga  which is good,btohqsg
I third this. why port out of giga? it's good,btohqsg
One way to think of this is whether u'll be comfortable lending money to Maxi-Cash at 6% when bank interest is at 3+% to 4+%.U can look up Maxi-Cash's financials online...,btohqsg
Has been used giga for many years and all good,btohqsg

UOB Lady'sBut is there a general definition that applies to most cards?Or what are the definitions (if it differs) for more popular 4mpd cards and general spending cards like citi premiermiles and UOB prvimiles,btohqsg
Coz the annual fee is non waivable  the rest can try to ask for waiver from the 2nd year,btohqsg

But mine is not sp group. Mine is under senoko energy.,btohqsg
i not familar with senoko... what is their payment method.i highly encourage everyone to use Tuaspower because they use SP billing.ANYWAY  I am sure your house still has water and rubbish under SP Billing,btohqsg
Counts towards the tier spend (500/1000/2000),btohqsg
UOB Lady n prvi has no requirements on contactless or mobile contactless or online or offline.,btohqsg
Sp billing has a very BIG advantage of being able to use app to partial pay only. Which enables you to easily play with your UOB One spending requirements.Last time can even overpay but it was nerfed a while ago.E.g. if you power bill is $300You can choose to pay $100 this UOB cycle and keep $200 for the next UOB cycle  provided you don't miss the due dates.,btohqsg
Ah didn‚Äôt know can partial pay w SP,btohqsg
and if you have close family and friends who are using GIRO or AXS to pay powerbills (OMG!?!?!) . you can volunteer to add their powerbill into your app  and you can pay for them and share the discount with them.,btohqsg
Ok  how about for Citi Rewards. Say if there's a problem of adding the card to Instarem Amaze  then I need to pay using Citi Rewards. Will QR scanning be counted as offline spend?,btohqsg

QR scan counts as online spend.,btohqsg

I throw everything into MooMoo money market fund. Depending  if you put SGD/USD it ranges around 3-5% p.a if Im not wrong,btohqsg
UOB VS contactless  4mpd  min $1000 max $2000 a month.,btohqsg
When using this method to hit $2k/mth  the rebate is still at 3.33+1%?,btohqsg
I am new to this Moo Moo account.How does this money market fund works ?Just transfer $$$ in ?Can withdraw anytime ?,btohqsg
yes can just bank transfer money in. Can withdraw anytime too,btohqsg
Make sure is cash plus. Not other fund.,btohqsg
yes correct.The special (4.3% or 10% merchants) are capped at $1500 spending per month.So you need to fulfil $500 of 3.33% spending + $1500 of special merchants to be maximised.,btohqsg

"Just a ""trick"" to share if have hospital bill to settle and also wanna buy big ticket item. For hospital bills can call in to request for temporary credit increase and its allowed up to 4x current limit and they will ask u how long u need say one month as that is the maximum allowed. So for example my credit limit is 20k. They increased to 80k. Then i settle my hospital bill now 67k. Clear the amount within the one month and just before the deadline reach go and buy your big ticket item (car or house) then use the card. I did it for my car previously and 80k at 1.5% i got 1200 ""discount"" for the car",btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have lei. It‚Äôs give 2023 one,btohqsg

If it is mistake  then you should call the bank to cancel the card. We cant really predict how a bank operates when it comes to fee charging.,btohqsg
They will still charge as it‚Äôs system generated  but you can waive it off easily since it‚Äôs not activated nor used,btohqsg
I think they will not charge. I have one with citibank.Anyway  if they charge  you can just ask for a waiver or close the card.,btohqsg

Have anyone faced issues with Cashback for uob one credit card.I signed up for the card in Jan (approved on 26jan)And got my first cash back recently but it seems too low...My first month it's prorated because they say the follow standard default cycle on 12th of the month (can be changed but I didn't)I hit all the requirements but some how I only got 33.33 CashbackExclude all the additional cash back and enhanced Cashback(promo additional Cashback) I have like 150 of shoppe purchase on the Feb month and 1k on the march oneBut only got 15 dollar additional  and 20 dollar enhanced don't think I hit the cap or anything.Any idea if I find discrepancy where should I file or clarify with uob?,btohqsg
33.33 means it is for 2 months (2/3 of $50 for $500 tier). So you joined for 2nd (before 12-Feb) and 3rd (before 12-Mar) months of your quarter. And latest month (13-Mar to 12-Apr) was your first month of your second quarter.,btohqsg
Perhaps you want to share with us your calculation n how much you think you shall get.,btohqsg
Cashback comes with your statement for your first month of the next quarter. It doesn‚Äôt come at the end of the quarter  you‚Äôll need to wait 1 more month.,btohqsg
Some do. Best not to assume  and check specifically,btohqsg
UOB One debit card has. Check your card's t&c.,btohqsg
That's smth I would like to confirm too.Issue is the additional cash back and enhanced CashbackIhave 150 on shoppe on Feb (additional =150*5%= 7.5Enhanced = 10.01)And 1045 on march statement(Additional =1045*5%=52.25Enchanced = 1045 *6.67 = 69.7)That would easily be close to 100(in total cap at 100 each for addtional and enhanced pee statement month),btohqsg
I saw this in the TNC but I alr got the cashback credited that's why I am confused,btohqsg
Quarter 1:26-Jan to 12-Feb (2nd month)13-Feb to 12-Mar (3rd month)Quarter 2:13-Mar to 12-Apr (1st month and here you receive the cashback for Quarter 1)13-Apr to 12-May (2nd month)13-May to 12-Jun (3rd month),btohqsg
Actually weird lol. Your first month for first quarter like missing.,btohqsg
UOB is something hard to explain‚Ä¶I joined early January  yet January was counted as the 2nd month üòÇ and my statement date is 1st.,btohqsg
Ya this seems to be the case.. so only 2 months in the first quarter.,btohqsg
This is  annoying to track  Hahahahah,btohqsg
$1045 on 12-Mar statement or 12-Apr statement?,btohqsg
1145(sorry I got the amount wrong just now) posted 20th marchSo u maybe right,btohqsg
Then you‚Äôll receive the cashback on your 12-July statement,btohqsg
Ok I think Oscar is rightI saw the statement date 26jan to 12 Feb the statement classified under FebSo the first quarter is 13 Dec  2023 to 12 march 2024,btohqsg
Also there‚Äôs no $33.33 cashback tier. It is prorated from $50 üòÇ (2/3 of $50),btohqsg
One question thou TNC states thisThe Additional Cashback will be calculated based on the total amount of Selected Merchant Transactionssuccessfully charged and posted to the Card Account in each Statement Month  capped at S$100 per StatementMonth. The Enhanced Cashback is capped at additional S$100 per statement month.Does that mean during the cash back receiving  month  (let's say I capped full cashback all 3 month apr/may/jun  iwill get 300 for additional and enhanced  for the quarter or 100 in additional and enhanced  only),btohqsg
It says capped at S$100perStatement Month,btohqsg

Hi all  just a curious question. If I DCA monthly vs DCA weekly will it make a big difference? (Not inclusive of fees),btohqsg
I wrote raffles place for branch. Signature should match both DBS and HSBC records,btohqsg
Oh sad. I don't want to go hsbc to add signature. Thought only dbs can already,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt remember. Just a few dollars I think,btohqsg
Won't able to apply for giro if you  don't have signature records with HSBC,btohqsg
So long as the ATM machine has the Mastercard logo you can draw the money out. Fee wise have to see the bank charges. Different ATM from different bank fees might be different,btohqsg
Guys  check with you  for OCBC infinite CC  if I use it to pay for insurance  it would not have cashback  but will it be considered as spend and clocked the minimum spend? Thank you!,btohqsg
Then you cannot apply GIRO already. That takes away 1/3 of the point of having HSBC EGA account,btohqsg
And still unclear start 1 may if credit card giro still have cashback?,btohqsg
All but 1 CSO say have. And they're not UOB CSO.. so...,btohqsg
Yea I am thinking maybe wait 2 weeks... if hsbc ega no more Cc giro cashback then just only use for interest ok,btohqsg

Not really ah if don't have cashback don't prefer to pay this way very inconvenience,btohqsg
I mean setup your signature with hsbc,btohqsg
May I ask for new credit card how do they count first month minimum spend pls. Do they prorated based on calendar month?,btohqsg
