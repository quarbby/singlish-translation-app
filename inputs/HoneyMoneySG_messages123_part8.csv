Haha I thought she meant taking cash advance at first. But is actually cash loan.,btohqsg
Its not that simple. Everything is to confuse you. Like this fine print is 5.88% effective interest rate pa. Instead of 3.13% nominal interest rate pa. And they have early termination fee too.,btohqsg
is this from Citi or Trust? Their apps' layout look quite similar,btohqsg
yeah i think what Melvyn is trying to say isnever access cash from bank either using credit card withdrawals at ATM or taking up their DEFAULT loan offersalways wait for the promo rates or for special offers,btohqsg
always ask the officer in the faceWhat is the EIR of the 'offer'.. they cannot lie on this on recorded phoneEIR (effective Interest Rate) factors in all the confusion like duration of the loan  any upfront fees  calculation methods.. etc..,btohqsg
not too bad la. At least they account for TVM in their fine print  so as not to scam you outright,btohqsg
In this case  she got a call from Citi. I received such call before with quoted low rate for quick cash. Then checked in the app with higher EIR and bazillion restrictions/complicated TnC.,btohqsg
but sometimes the phone offer OVERRIDES the app offer..,btohqsg
Yup  that's why I hardly ever entertain any phone loan offer. Want to lend me cash? Send it to me via email so that I can cross-tabulate on Excel,btohqsg
Hi  any suggestion for a current/savings account for receiving USD and getting high interest rate while waiting for right time to exchange into SGD? Thanks.,btohqsg
For Citi Prestige  I understand education is excluded from awarding miles through ThankYou points. However  will spending on education count towards Qualifying Spend to fulfil the $2k spend for sign up bonus miles?,btohqsg
You like to see all the evidence üòÅ,btohqsg
Hi experts  just checking if dining in a restaurant within a hotel overseas is considered under the exclusion of travel category for CRMC-amaze. TIA ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Depends on mcc but likely excluded.,btohqsg
Hi people just wanna check. I'm using amaze+citi. I know as long those mcc not in the list can get 4miles per dollar. However I'm getting flight ticket. Which is more then 1k and citi has a cap of 1k on the 4miles per dollar.Does my purchase on flight ticket affect the 1k cap on the 4miles per dollar mcc?,btohqsg
Flight ticket is under travel  doesn't get crmc 4mpd no matter what.,btohqsg
Like to check for uob nation of savers promo. As im currently on Q2 promotion and funds are still earmarked  if i were to join the uob nation of savers  i can still use the stash account to deposit another $100k and get approx 4.86% interest right?The downside is that for the uob one when i get the 150k funds back in mid Aug? i can only enjoy the 4% under uob one and more importantly i cannot transfer the 150k out from uob one while enjoying the nation of savers promo with my stash account?,btohqsg
Yeah I understand. What I mean does it affect the 1k amount allocated to the 4miles per dollar,btohqsg
No. 1k only counts for eligible transactions.,btohqsg
Just have one ticket spending. So abit lazy to get another card.,btohqsg
I don't have anything to say but thanks for paying for our rewards program üòÅ,btohqsg
Haha. Got one ocbc 365 and citi rewards. Unlucky both doesn't go for travel.mcc,btohqsg

Hi guys! If I have a CRMC+Amaze and my spend is normally below 1k and I want to get a backup card just in case it exceeded 1k  what would be the recommended next card for miles?,btohqsg
Actually it seems like based on the terms  if i were to use stash account i can still move my funds in/out from uob one once the stash is earmarked for the promo‚Ä¶ is this understanding correct? Thanks,btohqsg
What is ur spending pattern? More online or more offline? Locally or overseas?,btohqsg
Mostly locally. Sometimes go overseas will use amaze also. Like daily use - transport (less than $100 monthly)  food mostly  but I also use Tribecar and top up petrol. A little bit online shopping using heymax or ShopBack and Shopee. Then grocery.,btohqsg
I guess something like UOB ppv for mobile contactless? Then online/UOB merchant and overseas for crmc + amaze.,btohqsg
If u are new to uob  consider UOB prvi first,btohqsg
I am not new  I have lady card untouched lol,btohqsg
You can use Revolut to withdraw cash from CC. Will have some charge. Then from Revolut  you can trasfer to your bank account.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know how to use.. don‚Äôt like $5 spend then can earn,btohqsg
If you want to do it the opposite way you can consider shifting all of your online spend to DBS WWMC. If you are new to DBS then sign up for altitude first as WWMC has no sign up bonuses,btohqsg
I pick the US side since I already got everything ready there.,btohqsg
Just for sign up bonus? I see the card 1.3 miles per dollar like not very good,btohqsg
why not? take sign up bonus and keep the card one side,btohqsg
Why dont u use ur uob lady then? Just choose the category you use the most  example dining for me. It will help free up spend for crmc.,btohqsg
If I apply DBS altitude then approved liao I go apply DBS WWMC also can?,btohqsg
But it only calculate in terms of $5.. I feel the balance quited wasted,btohqsg
suggest to hit the sign up bonus requirement first then apply for the next card. no point diversifying spend among different cards if you are chasing for the bonus for one,btohqsg
Read up a bit on uob lady. Yes its 0.4mpd is subjected to 5$ block. Then month end  it will add all eligible spends  round down and award 3.6mpd. Not that bad i would say. Wont be much worse than crmc rounding down every trnx.,btohqsg
Hi all  just want to cfm for scb after get the welcome bonus and transfer to KF account. Can straight away cancel? As I read the t&c didn't mention anything regards to holding period unlike PRIV and KF ascend.,btohqsg
Sorry was mentioning about scb journey card,btohqsg
Hmm.. like this overseas also can use right? For dine in,btohqsg
can. pairing with Amaze is excellent for Lady's card as well,btohqsg
hsbc live+ new card use for shopee is eligible?,btohqsg
Which card would you all suggest if im looking for only lounge access and miles? Still confused whethet to take citi premier miles or hsbc trave1. Is there any other better options?,btohqsg
Hi experts again  I‚Äôve set a credit limit not knowing what impact it has on my first credit card with UOB at $15k. And my subsequent cards with them  they have maintained that limit even when I‚Äôve selected to let the bank decide the limit. This limit is much lower than what other banks have set for me. Wondering what impact does credit card limit have.Also  couldn‚Äôt find anywhere to confirm if spent on supplement cards count towards the minimum spend of the principle card. Wondering if anyone has experience in this to confirm ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
