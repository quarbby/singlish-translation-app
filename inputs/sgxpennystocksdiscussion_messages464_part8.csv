Trying to acclimatize us to the increased prices,btohqsg

Hand power to eye and mouth power. Easier job,btohqsg
Maybe it's just scheme to phase out cleaner after all converted,btohqsg
Next time is bring ur own plates and utensils,btohqsg

Very happening~Especially when I’m slogging with work.. Makes me feel shitty!! 😩,btohqsg
This one ah... Need go grassroot pap club to beg,btohqsg
Later they say...sinkie not hungry enough again,btohqsg
Why need to take down the job listing ah? I tot they need ppl do this de like those SDAs,btohqsg
Then they taichi to say is third party contractor post without permission,btohqsg
If contractor willing to pay this amount...means their tender price is high....,btohqsg
NEA willing to pay this much...might as well pay the cleaners more...,btohqsg
But this is contractor. One off cost,btohqsg
Means to get to an end of hiring less cleaners,btohqsg
I can see them patting themselves in the back for coming up with such a scheme to reduce cost in the long run,btohqsg
Don't know useful or not...or just money down the drain...,btohqsg
To me.. It's money down the drain,btohqsg
Cause eventually when the garbage piles up and the shit show gets exposed for being inefficient and tiring on the reduced cleaner workforce,btohqsg
My house coffeeshop installed the tray return shelves...it is empty. Got 1 cleaner auntie park her trolley beside...full of tray and dishes...not sure if it is working or not...,btohqsg

Before work from home started.. was cooking and packing own meal,btohqsg
Third party will top up to hire?No. That’s definitely the budget,btohqsg
