10-31-200209:08 AM by bullet1I have a 2000 Celica GT-S and a 2000 Subaru 2.5 RS  2 completely different cars. The Celica is a high reving variable valve timed engine that makes all of its power on the top end. It even makes power past its 8000 RPM redline. The RS makes all of its power from 3500 - 6000 RPM and then it dies  switching from car to car is quite an experience. The celica is much quicker than the RS but the RS is quicker when pulling through the middle of a turn and exit (AWD + More low end torque). Bot cars are extremely fun to drive  just have to adjust driving styles when switching cars. Also  both cars are very well put together  and by no means does a low redline mean poor quality. Just ask all the people with 200 000 miles on their subaru engine  there are plenty of them.,btohqsg
this is partially true. you cannot have a high revv engine if your technology is not there. the tolerances of engine pistons  rings  bearings etc. you tink it is easy to make high revv engine components that you can revv everyday without destroying it. so  why does turbo engine have lower revv? to preserve engine life. and why does honda turbo engine have higher revv limits than other turbo engine? performance. and technology it has can do better than competitors.Honda  turbo could have lowered the limits to 6000 helped by turbo but it doesnt do it. they still raise it higher than others in order to extract more power while allwing it to be used daily. but the same cannot be said for VW tfsi engine that has lowe revv.,btohqsg
high revv is ALWAYS better for HIGHEST performance or technology prowess,btohqsg
lesser machines always have LOWer revv limits,btohqsg
for those wanting to find out about mazda before buying. here is a good resource from international usershttps://www.reddit.com/r/CX5/comments/vht150/22_turbo_requested_pics_3k_miles_so_far_and/?%24deep_link=true&correlation_id=929375d3-2d59-4b37-a196-0dc4bb0dbb1f&post_fullname=t3_vht150&post_index=1&ref=email_digest&ref_campaign=email_digest&ref_source=email&utm_content=post_title&%243p=e_as&_branch_match_id=885488719602025234&utm_medium=Email%20Amazon%20SES&_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA22Q3U7DMAyFn6bcdW2TdlORpgmBeAburDRxt2j5I3EYj4%2FL2B1SEh1%2FR8e2ciFK5bnrMhpjaadS2jkbrp1Mp0aMMh0RVHliGbM926Ac1OyOly3VyJdGvPO53W67v7yOnkHm%2B%2Fox8cu1x0CF5deFhqlnIQRQzUuEjJ8VC6GBZHUBeQVvHRYoEVaVQQWz9Zc8YjSICbbFGvlGuWIj9jrmjE6RjQGsYT6LWR4mI1thprkdF3lo1TDv297ocVl6syzDyrkUC8FanQvK49ZOwmO1u2eDwW82BgYZV1bolXVg7Jm3vUPQyidlz%2BF%2Ft8SaNT48hpU86BiI%2F4Lp7xiy5PAHDfQboX8BAAA%3D,btohqsg
I think can compete with rs4/6 avant for nicest looking sw,btohqsg
It is now the fastest production wagon! With ‚Äújust‚Äù 503hp heheh,btohqsg
Wait I forgot about the Porsche Taycon GTS sport,btohqsg
And big enough to carry 2 doggos!,btohqsg
Amazing to see how the driver just goes full throttle on some curves. Mr Xun will be delighted that it can carry doggos too!@Jingxunn,btohqsg
Not same category as rs6 right,btohqsg
If mazda made a sports mazda 3 wagon,btohqsg
wah. time for me to switch from audi to bmw,btohqsg
Aiya they're all fast enough  hot enough. Good enough for my books ü§£,btohqsg
Rs4 is a more direct competitor!,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs true man. Honestly they‚Äôre all quicker than most of us can handle,btohqsg
Yes!!!! too bad i got no money to buy M3 Touring :(,btohqsg
Like not splitting hairs but just wagon category cars I guess..,btohqsg
maybe this will be Julian's new ride,btohqsg
you da richest among us sir.. you are our benchmark in car life! üòç,btohqsg
Mr Anwo i have $1.40 in my bank account  maybe you can make another donation of 600k for me to afford the M3 Touring?ü•∫ü•∫,btohqsg
i got a noob qns to ask you guys  i went for servicing for my toyota car   there some balance engine oil less than 1 litre   possible to to top up after every month not to waste it. any advice. paiseh not a car buff,btohqsg
Yeah roughly same length as the RS4. But just maybe 20cm shorter than the RS6 but longer than the Mazda3?,btohqsg
Later his dog üêï and diarrhea in the car üòÇ,btohqsg
Wait‚Ä¶ was it you who took my $1.40 spare cash yesterday sir? ü§î,btohqsg
Mr Xun's doggos seem to be petrol heads themselves if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
I heard they sit next to nice rims to show their appreciation when they see one. Such clever doggos,btohqsg
Balance where? I hope is inside the bottle not inside the engine ü§£,btohqsg
Can keep bah but I don‚Äôt think it will burn up oil so quickly though,btohqsg
Engine oil not cooking oil  won't spoil one la can just use,btohqsg
Depends. If you normally do 4 engine oil per year. Maybe can keep. If phv  they change oil every month. Can keep for next oil change.Normally don't keep. Because there will not be any chance for you to top up engine oil unless your gasket is worn and it burn engine oil.Engine oil has shelf live  after opening. The shelf live is shorter. No point keeping. Just give the workshop.,btohqsg
As in give workshop to replace when servicing,btohqsg
the work shop mech told me to take it back   and sel diy top up a bit,btohqsg
Why do you have spare anyway? If you car leaking better to fix the source of the leak,btohqsg
OH SHIET! making a run right now,btohqsg
Don't think your car will burn oil that quickly,btohqsg
Don't need top up. Unless your engine gasket worn. Burn engine oil and white smoke.,btohqsg
Yeah mann  they once say some nice set of rims on lied beside it  really good taste,btohqsg
If it is  then as Mr Aaron said  need to check if there's a worn gasket or a leak elsewhere,btohqsg
If burn oil that quickly engine will need overhaul already,btohqsg
but wasted no point i keep,btohqsg
Then just leave with the workshop,btohqsg
He'll use it for someone else's car,btohqsg
unless u drive audi  most of the time no need keep,btohqsg
When i drove a GTI  i kept a bottle of oil in my boot. IYKYK,btohqsg
Throw away then  unless you will do another oil change within the year,btohqsg
i thought every 6 mths need to change engine oil,btohqsg
so meaning no need to top up any thing at all lah,btohqsg
Check your owner's manual for recommended service intervals,btohqsg
based on the manual of toyota   is every 6 mths or 10000km which ever come first,btohqsg
