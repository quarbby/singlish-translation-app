how are the results required to even get in,btohqsg
If its the same as COP,btohqsg
Idk I nvr did it ahaha,btohqsg
Uncle think Tracey Ferreira is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
Nice  imma do my best then,btohqsg
Takes away a bit of the stress of the actual exam I guess (you can get an offer based solely on prelim results),btohqsg
But yeah didn't really help much,btohqsg
Does lifelong learning institute have study spots for outsiders ?,btohqsg
Yes but now cuz of covid no,btohqsg
do u need the shipping guarantee,btohqsg
later the goods come spoilt like@imindomie,btohqsg
hello does anyone know which topics came out as full qns for pure geog 2020 Os,btohqsg
cause my tys is up to 2019,btohqsg
Are there assigned books for combined literature? I'm still clueless,btohqsg
Hi guys just wanted to ask  is it possible to go triple science if you want to take CLB? And can you even take CLB in express? And if no  if you get like F9 for MT and A1 for everything else  will it affect JC admission?,btohqsg
1) depends on sch policy but most likely yes in your sch2) yes3) you need D7 minimum for MT to go JC  but honestly quite hard to fail at o levels,btohqsg
Ah ok thanks  one more question  so if I get D7 will it affect JC admission? Or will they not care?,btohqsg
no they wonâ€™t care  anyway itâ€™s MOE that puts you in the school,btohqsg
unless you get like L1R5 21 because your chinese D7 and you had to include it inside lah. in which case then ofc it matters,btohqsg
iâ€™m a clb student myself so yes,btohqsg
Ah ok thank you very much!,btohqsg
What is that supposed to mean,btohqsg
I tot u insult me haha,btohqsg
But my school didnâ€™t let me take CLB :(,btohqsg
"Hi! Those taking h2 fmath  how do y'all study for linear algebra? (span  LI  LC  generates  null  range  etc)And...do you actually need to state down every single definition during the proving or just state the ""workings""?",btohqsg
Linear algebra has a lot of terminology  so u would want to make sure u understand what they mean  and how they relate to one another  and how the abstract stuff like the terms u mentioned relate to the row operations stuff in particular,btohqsg
You don't need to define any of the terms used  because they're all very standard and well understood,btohqsg
Exam wise  they'll be asking to prove the relations only right? Or there would be more to it?(Ps. I'm taking as a private candidate  so don't have any background knowledge of how exam are tested for this subject),btohqsg
What u need to do in proving  eg proving that E is a subspace of X  is u need to write down the hypotheses (such as 'let x and y be in E' or 'let Î» be a real number')  then show the final statement,btohqsg
FM exams are very creative so honestly anything can happen  but if ur knowledge of how these concepts are related is solid  u should be able to tackle it,btohqsg
And of course if u haven't  watch 3B1B's video series on linear algebra,btohqsg
These videos are not really like a full guide to linear algebra  but more of how you should think about linear transformations and matrices and stuff,btohqsg
Okay  essentially  I need to understand and know the axioms required to be met for individual segment  and then to see how the different segments link up. Is that right?,btohqsg
About the axioms  youâ€™ll basically only see them when proving that something is a subspace  so just the 2 requirements of closed under addition and closed under scalar multiplication,btohqsg
But yeah u should understand each term  as in u should know what objects a term can be used on  and how the property described relates to other properties,btohqsg
Hmmm don't need the ones to prove whether it's a LC/ basis or whatever?,btohqsg
Those donâ€™t involve the axioms of linear spaces,btohqsg
But u need to know what those terms mean in order to prove them of course,btohqsg
Ah okay. This chapter making me quite confused. I'll go read up my notes again,btohqsg
Yeah just organise ur thinking first,btohqsg
Then everything will match up nicely,btohqsg
LA is a well trodden path,btohqsg
Hi guysSorry for troubling y'all  but I need help with music theory againðŸ˜­I feel my chords are a bit weird  so not sure if they are correct in the first place,btohqsg
The key is in G minor,btohqsg
2nd chord is probably wrong  you can't label it ib when there's no G at all,btohqsg
Well no offence. But i think chinese is impt. HAHAH,btohqsg
Failed until Sec 1 when they finally let me get exempted smh,btohqsg
Yeah but not as important as others  plus shld have some tech in teh future to help with language barriers. But knowing basic Chinese definitely imp,btohqsg
I think so. I knew someone who failed  then did clb  then failed clb  then finally exempted,btohqsg
Wtf i failed mlb like 4 years straight sia,btohqsg
