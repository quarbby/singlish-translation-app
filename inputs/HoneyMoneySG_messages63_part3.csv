Actually 4900 mcc shd have point. Is not exlcuded‚Ä¶not sure why bo point,btohqsg
Are you sure it's not excludedhttps://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/Rewards_Exclusion_List.pdf,btohqsg
U replied my post which has the answer to your question.,btohqsg
What happened if I withdraw the balance they not earmarked,btohqsg
Guys  which is the best miles card to book flight tickets on SQ ?Anyone tried DBS Altitude using Expedia? Are they offering 8 miles per $1 spent on SQ?,btohqsg
U would have violated the terms and conditions of the promotion.,btohqsg
Ok  I‚Äôll just ignore the 1k there üôÇ,btohqsg
can i get 1% cashback from hsbc ega for insurance payments?,btohqsg
It is stated in the DBS altitude website which airlines are included. The list of airlines are updated(added or removed) by DBS from time to time. When you booked your tickets  store a copy of TnC n keep it for future missing rewards claims  if need.In summary  the list of airlines is not fixed permanently. It depends on when you book.,btohqsg
For the rest of answers  you can search chat history using keyword ‚Äúcard air ticket‚Äù. There many people provided very useful answers on this.Good luck n enjoy your holiday.üòÄ,btohqsg
Hi guys  I will be travelling quite a bit the next few months and I was wondering if you'd recommend me Revolut or YouTrip? Any idea?,btohqsg
Ps. Maybe I c wrongly. I tot is 4900* apply to other cards,btohqsg
Go with amaze as primary and you trip / revolut as a backup.,btohqsg
Amaze wins youtrip / revolut for all transactions that earns credit card rewards. Yet amaze is not 100% reliable and can get declined.,btohqsg
Yea. Looking for something reliable though. Hmmm. What‚Äôs after Amaze?,btohqsg
Interestingly  there isn't any other card like Amaze for now.. it's unique.Maybe next time when Heymax comes  it will be king  if/when it comes.,btohqsg
"Oo so they look at 30 June 2023 balance?So is ""30 June 2023"" balance + 100k?",btohqsg
Can I check for OCBC titanium rewards CC  I can earn 4 miles per dollar on this selected category or must be those selected stores on the examples? Thank you.,btohqsg
Wah this is like even more powerful than amaze,btohqsg
to be clear  it is UOB One's 30th June day end balanceAS WELL ASTOTAL OF ALL UOB ACCOUNTS 30th June day end balance.,btohqsg
sorry i don‚Äôt understand why *0.05?,btohqsg
If you have $100k in uob one  your EIR interest rate is 5% which is 5%/100% = 0.05,btohqsg
ic. so for those that already have 100k on 30 june will  only be 0.05%,btohqsg
Has anyone tried to withdraw RM from the Johor ATM using the trust debit card? Going JB soon  want to know if it works üôÇ,btohqsg
5% in decimal form is 0.05  don't confuse yourself100 * 0.05 = 5100 * 5% = 5just different ways to say same thing,btohqsg
Sound be 5%  not 0.05%. It you want to enjoy NDP promo  topup another $100k to enjoy the promo. Mean you have $200k with UOB.,btohqsg
So to say they only look at June only?July and August. They ingore?,btohqsg
5% for the first 100k  0.05% for the next 100k  right?,btohqsg
Can I check what is the best credit card for a $5 000 spend (one time spend for wedding photoshoot)?,btohqsg
Uob doesn‚Äôt work on moving incremental balance basis. Yet.,btohqsg
Probably get a mix ofUob vs $2kUob ppv $1kAmaze crmc $1kI‚Äôm sure your wedding shop can accept 2 periods of payment. Deposit and final payment. Split over 2 cycles.,btohqsg
I wanted to reply what Mt said - UOB VS  best if can split. Maybe 2 * UOB VS + 1 * UOB PPV.But also wah what wedding photoshoot costs $5000 sia mine costs $1000 or less.. a lot of add ons and gown rental is it,btohqsg
Yes gown rental and other add ons,btohqsg
Basic one is already $2k and I just randomly chose one from internet. Branded one would be more expensive. Then most also include wedding car + wedding day photos / videos. $5k might not even be enough.,btohqsg
It works. Withdrew from CIMB atm. No atm fees also,btohqsg
for shopback's next visit to the merchant in order to receive prev cashback.. can I just make another 1 cent / 10 cents payment to receive it?,btohqsg
Yes. I don‚Äôt think anyone in this group interested on 0.05% of interest per year.Ie. $50 per year(0.05%) vs $5000 per year (5%) for $100k of saving.,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúBest Card wedding‚Äù to search chat history to see what other reply.,btohqsg
Have you guys heard of apple‚Äôs high yield savings account? Is it eligible for none US resident. Aka singaporean?,btohqsg
If u buy 2 items   just Q and buy 2 time üòÇ . Cash back will get on that day,btohqsg
