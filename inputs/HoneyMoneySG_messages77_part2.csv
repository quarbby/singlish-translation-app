Hi. Anyone having issues with HSBC app crashing?,btohqsg
If you use the app to pay via the QR code or whatever  your card pay the app  the app pay the merchant so become online payment.If you turn on your wallet  use the card directly to pay so your card pay directly to the merchant becomes mobile / contactless payment.,btohqsg
See Reddit or the previous messages for the workaround fix.,btohqsg

Hi all  how do i perform paynow salary from OCBC to UOB? Do i select paynow or local transfer? When i select paynow  i dont see a drop down menu for purpose of transfer as salary,btohqsg
"dun think ocbc has the salary payment as purpose anymore. Can do FAST from another bank  choose ""salary paymen"" from purpose dropdown list",btohqsg
Reminder for those existing accounts that registered for Nov'23 Bonus$aver Save Up Level up  need to fund by today (30 Nov 2023)https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/148419,btohqsg
Is FAST the same as Local transfer? If i use dbs to transfer to uob. Do i need to use computer or mobile app to make the transfer?,btohqsg
What are you guys' thoughts on buy now pay later schemes? Using atome  shopback  grabpay later or credit cards. How do i decide whether to use credit card or the other methods? Im holding onto dbs altitude  citi rewards  premiermiles and ocbc365 cards. Do any of these BNPL methods convert mcc? And would these count as online transactions too? Im also assuming the points/miles earned will occur whenever the installments are paid over few months?,btohqsg
can choose local transfer  then there is option whether transfer via fast  by default is fast. Can do on dbs website/app,btohqsg
Can I check for DBS point if they indicate Dec 2024 points expiry  does it expiry end of Dec or start of Dec?,btohqsg
Hi all  I'm looking at theIRAS rulesfor VCMA and I read this paragraph:As a self-employed person  if you wish to make (a) voluntary CPF contributions to your MediSave account under the CPF Board‚Äôs Self-Employed Scheme and/ or (b) cash top-ups to your MediSave account  you should check and comply with the CPF Board‚Äôs respective requirements and procedures for making (a) and/ or (b). This is so that the specific payment to your MediSave account that is intended to be (a) or (b)  is classified as such by the CPF Board.How do I make sure that the top-ups are classified under (b)? I am a fully SEP.,btohqsg
Kindly search the chat for previous dps about bnpl services.1. bnpl is reslly about cashflow. Or maybe you gonna bust your credit card caps (eg. I book a lot of hotels in a month  no more 1k on lady  so I pay using atome on citi rewards)2. yes unless credit card instalment but credit card instalment is not bnpl and also gets no rewards3. yes online but some dps say subsequent months not coded as online  so you should manually trigger4. yes,btohqsg
that's a very clever way to circumvent the CRMC exclusion for hotels,btohqsg
(a) is VCMA which you can do anytime this year(b) is SEP Mandatory MA  which is wait for NOA to finalize next year then CPF/IRAS will instruct you to do.This is assuming you are first year SEP,btohqsg
I see ok  actually I'm second year SEP but last year and this year I VC 37% of my NTI to all 3 accounts  so the MA portion of my VC exceeds the mandatory MA. The reason why I ask is that I wanted to do an additional $8k to my MA for tax relief purposes  but I kept poring through the IRAS docs and I realized that my tax relief for VC is capped at 37% of my NTI. Hence  I directed the $8k to my SA instead through RSTU. Not ideal  prefer to put in MA  but for tax relief purposes bopian.,btohqsg
