Sorry can I ask  how about AAS. Is it more reliable than Vicom or STA? According to dealer  if independent workshop or AAS then its “for own references”If dealer push for Vicom PPI but says that will not rectify any issues found if PPI not done at Vicom? Any opinions? Shld I just proceed with Vicom as per dealer request?,btohqsg
Nvr met a dealer scared of PPI at independent ws betore,btohqsg
If got defect but choose not to rectify  then just don proceed...,btohqsg
Usually PPI both dealer n buyer on site to see,btohqsg
Paid the confirmation deposit le 🥲,btohqsg
Now I just trying to proceed with caution,btohqsg
PPI only engine or gearbox failure or Major accident then can refund mah,btohqsg
AAS not very good with conti/korea cars. Mainly jdm,btohqsg
Vicom sta Aas not very good in detailed check,btohqsg
I paid for the deposit and subsequently asked if can go for PPI at independent workshop,btohqsg
When I ppi i got send for engine compression test n leakntest one,btohqsg
Was looking at Kaizen or AAS,btohqsg
Lmao shud have ask before paying,btohqsg
Name and shame dealer pls thanks,btohqsg
I think maybe still can try to rectify,btohqsg
Actually the situation is: haven’t found any defect,btohqsg
Wanna send for PPI. Haven’t even send,btohqsg
As long as japan car ok. Slightly better than vicom or sta i think,btohqsg
Jdm cars usually not much issues,btohqsg
So I ask IF go PPI alr got defect  can they rectify? They say for own reference if not Vicom,btohqsg
If defect is other wear n tear might be abit hard,btohqsg
Eh not true hor. Jap car also got issues,btohqsg
Can nego for a reduction in price,btohqsg
Have is have  wont be as jialat as conti,btohqsg
Parents gong gong go buy a vezel... repair already 3k liao...,btohqsg
But not advisable to do the PPI at Vicom is it?,btohqsg
100k mileage left 2.5yrs... so much issues...,btohqsg
Coz if do at Vicom then if got problem  the dealer say they will rectify for me,btohqsg
If got own ws better.. if not then bo bian go vicom or sta lo,btohqsg
But if PPI elsewhere they so called don’t accept the result,btohqsg
I found an article and saw good reviews about Kaizen so was planning to send there initially,btohqsg
If ur dealer don agree... also kinda pointless...,btohqsg
Most prob vicom report will be good,btohqsg
Is because of the part the dealer say they won’t accept issues from other workshop other than Vicom then I feel abit stuck,btohqsg
So shld I proceed with Kaizen or AAS and if the results is not good  no choice but to forfeit or try nego back for the deposit?,btohqsg
Or just go with Vicom as per dealer?,btohqsg
I believe so. Vicom u can try lo. But most likely the report will be no issue found,btohqsg
How old is the car and mileage?,btohqsg
Anyway just prepare abt 2-3k for wear n tear lo. No choice,btohqsg
Just go Vicom and OR STA,btohqsg
As long as no major accident can liao,btohqsg
They won’t hide this kind of major thing right?,btohqsg
Coz I already thinking if wanna just send to kaizen and see if got prob. Since they so confident to send to Vicom I think Vicom won’t find issues. According to kaizen they have a slightly more comprehensive check than Vicom. If really got problem then at least can see if lemon law will help.,btohqsg
