Because now the money is gone,btohqsg
Public companies don't work like that,btohqsg
Yes they are owned by Bezos but in that token if I buy a share of AMZN on NYSE I also own Amazon along with like millions other ppl who hold their stock,btohqsg
He gets money from dividends when amazon distributes them,btohqsg
Dividends are profits distributed to shareholders,btohqsg
Not the complete picture also cuz Bezos gets Restricted Stock Units and Options which he can excerise,btohqsg
I thought restricted stock units are part of employee compensation tho?,btohqsg
He can excerise the options and basically effectively print new shares and sell off shares to main the same percentage ownership,btohqsg
So its more of active income rather than passive?,btohqsg
Yep and it's better than that,btohqsg
Because he can loan his shares as collateral to a bank and get capital that way,btohqsg
I just finished reading a business book that's why I asked,btohqsg
All while keeping his ownership at the same percentages,btohqsg
Who here got into nvda before earnings call,btohqsg
Like 75% i read properly lol,btohqsg
The book focuses more on network marketing,btohqsg
Which I feel is quite an interesting business model,btohqsg
But I js got no time and effort rn fr,btohqsg
Is the O Level Chinese Paper on SGExams Discord?,btohqsg

The OG Engineering seems to be replaced by CS and Computer Engineering now...,btohqsg
Is pretty much stem and design thinking and Abit of dnt,btohqsg
Quite interesting that SMU Computer Science is the one topping tho instead of NTU and NUS.,btohqsg
Well according to the article (yea I know it said top 25%),btohqsg
I think it's more towards the trend CS are more desirable degree. With better entry salary.,btohqsg
Also  is there really a housing crisis in Singapore... until homeowners need to illegally partition out the bomb shelter as a coffin room ðŸ˜¢ ?https://johor.chinapress.com.my/?p=1196612,btohqsg
seems like headed into HK direction ._.,btohqsg
SMU always was focused on Graduates outcome and imo the only thing u go to SMU for is the networking and their career office. Idk about NUS but anyone who is from NTU can attest to the incompetence that is NTUs CAO... also NUS and NTU more research focus.,btohqsg
on o-n mt there is a paper,btohqsg
Clinics in Singapore are ramping up resources to cope with the rising number of patients with COVID-19 and other illnesses.Doctors are also urging people to stay up to date with their vaccinations:https://cna.asia/4aBc16gðŸ’‰When did you last receive a COVID-19 jab?,btohqsg
Just curious tho  how many Singaporeans actually drink directly from the tap?,btohqsg
50 cents SGD I expect atleast have ice cubes or atleast chilled as a Malaysian ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
didn't even consider boiling it? haha,btohqsg
but my family still boils water,btohqsg
by human nature I will still boil it in a kettle and let it cool down  unless it has another indoor filter system.,btohqsg
I went to UK  and EU  damn their tap water is hard water lol,btohqsg
the eu the tap water is like shit,btohqsg
it is the too much mineral build up that's the bad part. lol.,btohqsg
They need to be passed through something called a Brita Filter or something to atleast make it drinkable lol,btohqsg
the filter system that removes cl2,btohqsg
only reason it won't be ok to drink tap water in most of europe is if your gut can't handle it  which is more of your body not being used to it,btohqsg
or you just don't like the taste,btohqsg
Would be funny if it was the same restaurant as where i did it,btohqsg
I was eating vegetarian mala and i bought their iced water for 50 cents  but drank it too fast and i wasn't gonna bother paying another 50 cents so i walked to their washing hand tap area and refilled my cup,btohqsg
I got water for $1 before,btohqsg
but it was one of those Japanese places so uhh makes sense,btohqsg
I wonder Singapore have toppled trees these few weeks,btohqsg
in KL trees been falling onto cars  rooftops flown off like mad recently this past few weeks,btohqsg
