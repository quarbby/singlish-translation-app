you'll end up either smuggling coke or seeing pingpong shows,btohqsg
edam is the only cheese that is made backwards,btohqsg
Thank you for this info I needed it,btohqsg
technically if you look at the straw in the two dimension  it does not have a theoretical holehowever  if you were to look at it in the three dimension  it has two holes. one on top and one belowit is physically impossible for a straw to have one hole  as it would not function as a straw anymoreone may argue that the hole starts and ends from top to bottom  but for this to be true you would need to reevaluate the meaning of hole. in this case  it can be taken as absence of spacetherefore  a straw can either have two holes or zero holes dependent on the dimensional view of a straw,btohqsg
if u cut the straw thin enuff,btohqsg
unlike a straw  a donut is not tunnel-length nor shaped.we can take into consideration the 2 dimension for the case of objects such as a donut  thus it has one holea torus in theory only has one hole as it begins and ends at the same point  where as a straw hole begin and ends at two separate pointstherefore  a donut and a straw do not have the same amount of holes. leading to the conclusion that a donut has one singular hole and a straw has two holesthe floor is now open to questions,btohqsg
i've got the pole if you've got the hole,btohqsg
Need to make merch out of this,btohqsg
but what if he crashes his car? does he still alhamdulillah?,btohqsg
Bro why alhamdulilah when you become speedhantu already,btohqsg
which kid had an itchy hand and pressed the report,btohqsg
i shit you not it was massive,btohqsg
Sorry bro   I accidentally pressed the button,btohqsg
buddy i'm asking you to stop spamming,btohqsg
Yes i have more 😂 but I’m not spamming 😅 i just wanted to share my spotting with you,btohqsg
ok cool can keep it local,btohqsg
Hi guys anyone know the owner?,btohqsg
sure-fire way to get timmac closed off to public with the amount of meets 🤣,btohqsg
cs3s doing one tire fires  pops and bangs that aren't enforced,btohqsg
and how would you enforce said rules?,btohqsg
every night meet ends up with either someone's pop and bang tuned car blowing up or someone with an open diff trying to do a burnout  ending hilariously.,btohqsg
so what's being done to enforce it?,btohqsg
not the first CS3 to do a one wheel peel 😇,btohqsg
you lot that host meets need to seriously enforce the idiots that do this type of shit,btohqsg
at the least  respect the place you're holding your meets at.,btohqsg
if u take offence to it  he has video evidence & it’s generally always the same model of car that stirs up this kinda trouble 🤷🏻‍♀️,btohqsg
wonder if this guy got a police report lol,btohqsg
there are rules yes  but if people keep disrespecting the location and disregarding the rules then no point,btohqsg
hope it doesn't but seeing how the meets are nowadays it's only a matter of time😬,btohqsg
the unholy trinity would be the CS3s  1.4 Roccos and Lancer EXs LMAOOO,btohqsg
special mention to a particular kia koupe,btohqsg
just gonna put this out here,btohqsg
after sending this nothing was done in subsequent meets hosted by said organiser,btohqsg
and they have also cleared this chat,btohqsg
doesn't seem responsible to me 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
feedback from someone who went the morning AFTER the 30 march meet,btohqsg
i seriously doubt this organiser has any responsibility when he hosts his meets unlike some others who have done the role of cleaning up after others when their own meets were overthat being said  not surprised if the name gets a bad rep in the future. and with the authorities no less 😆(which i am pretty sure are in here),btohqsg
i don’t want to just say one particular person  but everytime there’s a story or trouble comes it’s always from the same groups who hold their car meets,btohqsg
anyways 🤣 u know who u are la hor... if continue maybe name and shame is the way to go,btohqsg
"they're quite ""elusive"" when it comes to being responsible huh.",btohqsg
oh ya he also blocked me i think,btohqsg
"my response to your texts in the future will be followed by ""i will talk the other""",btohqsg
quite fucked ah maybe should call tp in advance,btohqsg
issok got direct contacts within liao,btohqsg
actually im down the road from them,btohqsg
might as well drop by tp hq later right 😆,btohqsg
maybe TP should be a mainstay at all meets to enforce them in the future don't you think,btohqsg
no revs  no pops and bangs  no vaping,btohqsg
as long not LTA can already,btohqsg
just as how the organisers intend it!,btohqsg
what if i need to shit really badly  i need to pop and bang man,btohqsg
@k4gescan u change his admin name to smtg racist,btohqsg
why so many people taking pics at suntec,btohqsg

and some bmw sending it behind me,btohqsg
eh@johnnyyzzzwhy u delete ur reply lol,btohqsg

so much for representing a community,btohqsg
then want say other people ride bicycle,btohqsg

Please have some car meet adequate whoever u are.,btohqsg
lol if they really wanna talk cock right,btohqsg
if no fear do burn out  no fear install pop and bangs. do properly lor,btohqsg
i saw a pretty cs3 yesterday  oversized cams  custom taillights. and he didn’t need a pop and bang kit 🙈,btohqsg
need to askEthanif he pay back hazel her money already,btohqsg
later when car community become targeted,btohqsg
“i wish it wasn’t as toxic as last time”“sg is killing the car community”“bro lta saman me sia but the problem so small”,btohqsg
Try hosting a meet and controlling people lolol meet to noisy for u go library,btohqsg
it's not targeted when it's the norm,btohqsg
> cars & kopi> collecting cars> that huge underground meet at bigbox years ago,btohqsg
the meet isnt open to riced cars unfortunately for them,btohqsg
my personal smaller meets? other friends who do organise meets can actually manage that?,btohqsg
it's not about the control  it's about the crowd,btohqsg
aw man so i can’t come?,btohqsg
when your crowd has a peabrain and loves p&bs  you attract tp,btohqsg
okay bringing my pop and bang cs3 one wheel peel,btohqsg
don't find trouble  trouble won't find you,btohqsg
the elusive community only wants bicycles now 🫶🏼🫶🏼,btohqsg
hey bro  pops and bangs are cool!,btohqsg

and they're actually decent to drive,btohqsg
u just made a statement that it’s dumb for them to say shit like that when ur in the gc,btohqsg
just that all of them have shit p&b tunes,btohqsg
the twin charged ones are genuinely fun,btohqsg
i mean if they wanna talk shit to u also… this chat is public and they can hold a convo here instead of behind ur back,btohqsg
but they take offence bc i laugh at their disproportioned wings LOL,btohqsg
but they’re more likely to understeer,btohqsg
eh cb i talking to u,btohqsg
but hey if you're a <25 singaporean male it HAS to be white + p&b tune on rep TEs or BBS,btohqsg
okay la now i don’t see much riced out ones or bad mods to golfs/sciroccos,btohqsg
because alot of them are scrapped,btohqsg
half the p&b ones already tio TP,btohqsg
ah ok i kena removed already AHHAHAAHAHA,btohqsg
this just shows what kind of community he’s running if they can’t ever take care of the locations they’ll organise meets on,btohqsg

Blame the drivers not the car,btohqsg

a few friends track their CS3s,btohqsg
timings can match quite a few of the contis,btohqsg

At least the quiet person knows what he/she talking about modding vios can be fast 🤣,btohqsg
the vios engines are good though.,btohqsg
u at least have a full community to see ur opinions and what u have to say,btohqsg
1ZZ has always been a good engine,btohqsg
from the altis to the celica to the lotus lol,btohqsg
come talk to me f2f and share w me ur vios story,btohqsg
eh did they all use 1zzs,btohqsg
either way the 1zz is super tunable,btohqsg
but if u dare to do the mods to even get it where it’s supposed to be? is a diff story,btohqsg
on any day i cld walk faster then a hotwheels,btohqsg
if you don't be an asshat and p&b tune it,btohqsg
and put love and care into it,btohqsg
i will gatekeep my baby no longer,btohqsg

do pm if you know of someone selling direct from Mugen. TIA!,btohqsg
No drama  but just wondering why the ones who create the drama in this car community must be someone that don’t even have license 🤔,btohqsg
@NH0Wayi guess we don’t have license bro,btohqsg
i guess asking legit questions in their chat about wheels gets you banned 🤣,btohqsg
