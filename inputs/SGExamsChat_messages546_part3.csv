i been living in a cave with no social media,btohqsg
apparently. real ones know musically tho,btohqsg
I thought it was a whole company,btohqsg
I thought sugaresque has a tutotion agency not a solo tutor,btohqsg
Her audience is mostly younger girls,btohqsg
Who see her as an ideal role model,btohqsg
Yeah  at least according to people who claim to know her,btohqsg
why is she even a role model,btohqsg
i should be a role model too,btohqsg
i sleep and study and eat,btohqsg
I‚Äôm going to take a wild guess here and say maybe going off the unpaved route,btohqsg
its not even that big of a deal,btohqsg
Her target audience is 14-16 year old girls,btohqsg
Clearly thrs a market for her content,btohqsg
My friends and I have all claimed that something major happened with all the 05 and onwards babies,btohqsg
05 and beyond like got sth wrong one,btohqsg
04s r the last okok batch,btohqsg
cuz im gna go uni with 05s,btohqsg
its where most of the sjws come from,btohqsg
The 05s and above like don‚Äôt have fear,btohqsg
I just found out she exists today,btohqsg
The recent case of 05s and above committing crimes just because they can just further proves my point,btohqsg
Like who tf throws food into the Istana grounds for ‚Äúfun‚Äù,btohqsg
Maybe the straits times say revenue as profit accidentally?,btohqsg
No way 6 fig tuition sole profit right,btohqsg
Apart from the 17 yr old arrested last year  there was that kid challenging the spf on the road,btohqsg
Influencers make money like nobody's business,btohqsg
look at how many more times the 15-16 yr olds were admitted compared to the 16-17rs olds,btohqsg
something def going on...and i know discipline is not one of them,btohqsg
US student fees are crazy man...,btohqsg
tf really happened..because unless there was a change of laws  something went very wrong,btohqsg
One meal is like 17 USD,btohqsg
Wtf... I plant my own potato in Texas instead hahaha,btohqsg
In 2021 136 active sec schools in sg,btohqsg
Less than 1 per school in boys home..,btohqsg
cause i do think the law is getting laxer on the public in general,btohqsg
What most of them do sia,btohqsg
I also can be tuition teacher already üòâ,btohqsg
I think should be hard labour for serious crimes,btohqsg
actually tuition isnt just abt the notes,btohqsg
altho her claims that she made them herself r obviously wrong and misleading,btohqsg
tuition is more abt the teacher teaching and conducting a lesson?,btohqsg
"I think boys home intake are dropping because..the ones that gets send to boys home are the violent ones...but violent youths have been dropping while youths involved in non-violent drugs crime and non violent sexual crimes have been rising.Since most of them are not deemed ""violent""...they are given probation or are able to bail out",btohqsg
Her speaking skills not bad though,btohqsg
her tuition is more of a celebrity meet and greet,btohqsg
If this is really the case  we have to rework our laws,btohqsg
because...it appears very simply that  punishments are not working,btohqsg
Maybe people more willing to listen to her rather than an retiree from mindstrechers,btohqsg
Tbf ive never seen a person from mindstretchers scoring high before,btohqsg
wasn't some tutition centers banned from advertisingby IMDA,btohqsg
