citi rewards card cannot use directly for online transactions?,btohqsg
I would always use Amaze card with CRMC to be on the safe side.Since Amaze only has problems with Hotel/Car Rental/Airlines hold transactions issue  and CRMC excludes such merchants in the first place  I don't see any downside to always use Amaze+CRMC even if the merchant is already an online merchant.,btohqsg
Offline you use Amaze  so it converts transactions to online,btohqsg
Thank you. Does it require physical card? Or can use the app?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not very sure actually üòÖ,btohqsg
In the app you can get the card details. But amaze you can add to Google Pay only. If you use an iPhone  you‚Äôll need the physical card,btohqsg
Anyone parked their spare $ in the fullerton usd cash fund to get the 5+% ?,btohqsg
Hi guys  for moneysmart credit card sign up promo  do I submit my claim before hitting the $500 spend or do I hit the $500 spend then submit my claim?,btohqsg
For online transactions (e.g Klook)  can I use my CRMC directly?,btohqsg
So they will automatically track when I hit $500 spend if I claim early?,btohqsg
Unless its a card that gives more rewards for specific MCC or transactions  its almost always better to use amaze paired with it,btohqsg
Klook is classified under MCC4722 Travel Agencies and Tour Operations. CRMC excludes travel,btohqsg
Nope can't. Klook is travel cmrc excluded travel mcc,btohqsg
Ok! Means it‚Äôs better to use Amaze card directly?,btohqsg
Nope. Can't use any even cmrc with amaze. Mcc is excluded,btohqsg
What does it really mean when amaze converts transations to online spending if the base MCC is unchanged?,btohqsg
Literally what u said. All transactions will be online but underlying mcc code will not change. So your card must be able to satisfy both criteria for the rewards to be given,btohqsg
When merchants transfer the transactions info to credit card company  it consists few info  including two info below:1). Online  swipe card  mobile contactless  or manual etc‚Ä¶2). MCC code,btohqsg
Apologies   can u simplify further? üòÖ,btohqsg
Already very simplified. I dunno how to simplify further.,btohqsg
Does that mean I just need to maintain  50K (earmark) + 1K (30th June Balance) ?If my account have 55K   does that mean I can withdraw 4K ?Not sure if I understood correctly,btohqsg

Hi  what‚Äôs the best way to earn miles for a 10K lux watch?,btohqsg
Firstly  you need to check what is the mcc code of the merchants. You can search using either merchant name or mcc code at:https://heymax.aiThen check credit card TnC is it in whitelist or exclusion list,btohqsg
Did you enable your amaze card to use oversea or online?Is it exceed your credit limit?Did you activate your card ?,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply. MCc is 5944 which is excluded from most of the bonus miles. Seems to me prvi miles is the best choice with 1.4X and no cap,btohqsg
Wanted to check if I missed out any other cards,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. Many people benefits from it. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Since hsbc revo gives 2.5% whereas citi rewards gives 2.27%  will hsbc revo be a better option?,btohqsg
Depends on what you plan to spend on. Citi rewards exclude travel but include most of others. Whereas Hsbc revo is based on mcc codes in whitelist.,btohqsg

All expenses will be converted automatically,btohqsg
Just check the mcc if match will be eligible alr,btohqsg
There is strategy? Basically you want to jump q need TPPS or QPPS member. Otherwise for hot routes like HK you can forget about it....,btohqsg
This particular IRAS Giro did not receive EGA 1% cash back since 2 weeks ago. Just check with HSBC:We need more time to check on GIRO 1% cashback non receive  kindly allow 3-5 working days.,btohqsg
Wait until 2 weeks before onboard is quite risky if well planned tripUnless spend more miles to advantage to guarantee get the ticket  but very a lot,btohqsg
