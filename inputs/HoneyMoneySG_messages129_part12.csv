I think they extend  initially it finished 31 Aug and use June as reference but now I see it finished end of Sep and use July as refer,btohqsg
Ok I just checked. There is aAugust September promo. Reference month July.Which means there should not be a July August promo. The earlier should be June July promo reference month May,btohqsg
I opened the account June 4th to have fresh fund given may had no account,btohqsg
So now. Your money in August September will earn bonus interest on top of July adb. Provided fresh funds,btohqsg
That means 140k- 113 K or 140K - 5K ( given that 108 K carried over from June) ?,btohqsg

Hi trying my luck here  anyone has china number? I need to activate my lock that I’ve bought from Taobao which need China number. Willing to pay a small fee to do it,btohqsg
Any idea till when? Or permanent?,btohqsg
GXS new 'fixed deposit'. The interest rate is pretty good considering the current interest rate environment.,btohqsg
I see  damn I only have HSBC and SC esaver  any other good option without locking money ?,btohqsg
Do I need to pay fees to convert 13800 points to miles for HSBC Revolution credit card ?I am thinking to claim the points and closed the cardThanks,btohqsg
I think it is targeted  I don’t receive this,btohqsg
You can convert for free till 31 Jan 2025 but you will probably need more pts. Min is 25k pts.,btohqsg
Yeah I just got that too. Transferred from other pocket to this pocket and topped up 1k from mari savings.,btohqsg
Oh okay  thanks muchI don’t think it is wise to spend more on this hsbc revolution card now  only one point per dollar,btohqsg

Previously already created a boost pocket  now with this  I wonder how many pockets we can create…,btohqsg
The TnC mentioned 1 new version boost pocket at anytime. But this new boost pocket is not the same as the previous boost-savings pocket.Thus  I can have the previous boost-savings pocket created in July  and 1 new boost pocket based on my interpretation. I don't have money for the new boost pocket so cannot try yet.,btohqsg
Why need Oct? If we receive the 1%  mean will receive the rest in Oct?,btohqsg
Do you guys use Moneybull in webull for both SGD / USD ? or it works only for one currency ? I have concerted 100 Sgd to USD to test but it doesn't go through into the USD moneybull Market fund,btohqsg

Wondering if there is a change in “rule” by DBS,btohqsg
Sep 1 was Sunday 🤭Give some time  you still have the whole month ahead of you,btohqsg
Will keep a look out for the next few days,btohqsg

UOB One account and UOB One card is different  which are you referring to?And what is your quarter period?,btohqsg

Hi all  how does hsbc ega 1% giro work? For eg if I do fulfil the criteria at the start of the month 1st Sep (2k deposit & 5 transaction) the 1% cashback will be based from 1st Sep - 1st Oct?,btohqsg
What did you spend on?Which credit card you use?Which month you started to spend $500?,btohqsg
Yes minimum is 100 sgd  max is 30 000 sgd if I remembered correctly.,btohqsg
Straight forward actually. After you are qualified  you get 1% cashback from all ur giro bill payments.for that month. Like bill 600$ then you see 6$ credited to ur ega acct few days later.,btohqsg
Cause I understand that it also capped at $300  so was just wondering when will it refresh,btohqsg
Yes both active. Before i tried to disable/enable USD again. but only SGD Moneybull is generating P&L  the USD one is not working at all...Not sure if both works ( Similar to Moomo smart cash Plus)  or only the first one you choose   Does anyone know ?,btohqsg
