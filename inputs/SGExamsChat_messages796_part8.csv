as with assessment criteria  it depends on the project  what it is about,btohqsg
i would have so added roblox into my poly work if i could,btohqsg
some group projects do hv peer evaluation component tho it is damn damn damn negligible weightage,btohqsg
and hence it promotes free loading,btohqsg
it is not like in school where u can report to the examining board,btohqsg
uni / poly dun give any damn into such cases,btohqsg
my slides are normal don‚Äôt worry,btohqsg
there was someone who flew to the ceiling and broke the bag compartment,btohqsg
but in the video no coz she took it after the plane has alr landed safely in bangkok,btohqsg
I mean from a peer assessment perspective. If you play your cards right  just tell everyone to give everyone full marks  and everyone won't get screwed over. üòÇ,btohqsg
Damn so that injured person wasn‚Äôt brought back to their seat,btohqsg
when u are pissed  u are pissed:-(,btohqsg
The person at the toilet area,btohqsg
he is one of the critically injured with a cracked head,btohqsg
no he was being attended to by an air stewardess,btohqsg
sorry this one is the one that flew up  not the one lying on the floor,btohqsg
Oh ok I thought it would‚Äôve been dangerous for the person lying on the floor to remain there,btohqsg
well  that's why need to be the nice guy :),btohqsg
some people cant get up  some people were using the toilet when the turbulence happened,btohqsg
form good connections and show you did work  so people don't have reason to hate on you lol,btohqsg
I hope there‚Äôs more updates soon,btohqsg
The flight fell into an air pocket while cabin crew were serving breakfast before it encountered turbulence  prompting the pilots to request an emergency landing in the Thai capital.,btohqsg
Passengers on board flight SQ321 were carried out of the plane after the aircraft made an emergency landing in Bangkok.One person has died after the SIA flight from London to Singapore was hit by severe turbulence. Follow our live coverage:https://str.sg/sjjw,btohqsg
The exception is what is known as ‚Äúclear air turbulence‚Äù  which Mr Chow said occurs suddenly and is not detectable by radar.‚ÄúThe only prevention is  if you have no reason to go to the toilet  no reason to stand up  you sit down and belt up. That is the best practice ‚Äù he said.,btohqsg
Thats whyyy. I see around on my social media ppl at like early 20s  they  bto  doing renovations  talking abt their finances n savings etc. üíÄ i feel so stress out,btohqsg
After around 11 hours of flying time from take-off in London  the aircraft sharply dropped from an altitude of around 37 000 feet to 31 000 feet within just five minutes as it finished traversing the Andaman Sea and neared Thailand  according to FlightRadar24 data.‚ÄúSuddenly the aircraft starts tilting up and there was shaking  so I started bracing (myself) for what was happening  and very suddenly there was a very dramatic drop  so everyone seated and not wearing (a) seatbelt was launched immediately into the ceiling ‚Äù Mr Dzafran Azmir  a 28-year-old student on board the flight told Reuters.‚ÄúSome people hit their heads on the baggage cabins overhead and dented it  they hit the places where lights and masks are and broke straight through it ‚Äù he said.,btohqsg
why they had to carry that passenger so up,btohqsg
had to lift it above the seats,btohqsg
either taking loans from banks and repay in 30/35 years  hope the interest rate isn't that high lol,btohqsg
what makes you think your parents never took out unrepayable loans etc to fund their lifestyle when they were young,btohqsg
ye i was wondering wont that just send u thru the ceiling,btohqsg
cant imagine waking up to that,btohqsg
This is why u wear seatbelts,btohqsg
Or if u know there will be very bad turbulence u go to the fight attendants seat instead :D the 3 point harness is more secure/s,btohqsg

If u wanna put any NP or SP courses put them either first or second if not u get auto filtered out.,btohqsg
You can basically list achievements from your CCA records. What's your LEAPs 2.0 looking like? U at a -1 or -2?,btohqsg

You were supposed to be given a copy of your finalised CCA records when u graduated.,btohqsg
I did not even try to do it when applications came out,btohqsg
My friends eae into tp engineering after a 15min zoom session and was successful...I was questioning if I regretted not applying after he did that,btohqsg
Apparently all he got asked was what he would he install in a home or something simillar in a home after a elderly fell down.His straightup answer was Minecraft logic.A pressure plate infront of the main door where the elderly can crawl to and alert medics,btohqsg
