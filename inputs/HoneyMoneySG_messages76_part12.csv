yeah dual sim make sense to buy a HK set..i am actually not targetting u don't get me wrong.it was actually way before you  many people keep saying go HK or JP must buy Iphone.. i don't get why,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see the value in Apple Watch I‚Äôm considering a garmin instead,btohqsg
i keep FOMOing if i forget to factor in something.. why i keep calculate like not worth it,btohqsg
So u mean the alipay (not alipay HK) and WeChat pay that are installed here (sg) from app can only be used in China but not HK?,btohqsg
anyone know what can i invest my USD in ibkr that's similar to Fullterton USD Cash fund?,btohqsg
Being served by Ê∏ØÂ¶π or JPMM? I didn‚Äôt use my Cantonese since my unit was special reservation and I couldn‚Äôt find the vocab to say that so I just defaulted to English. But I speak JP in Japan since their English is atrocious,btohqsg
Added Japan analysisJPY219 800FX = 111.18= SGD1 977Add 4% bank and card markup = SGD2 056Assuming Citi Prestige at 4.5mpd = 9 252 miles @ 1.5 cents = SGD139 valueNET COST = SGD1 917,btohqsg
From what I know Alipay (maybe WeChat pay too) does not have SG wallet (correct me if I‚Äôm wrong) so the China wallet I don‚Äôt think accepted in HK. But you can link you Visa and MC to still use Alipay as a payment method though I fail to see why you don‚Äôt just use the CC directly,btohqsg
There is even a supermarket in SZ that only accepts HK/Macau wallet Alipay for payment and not China Alipay,btohqsg
hi guys! can i ask if ntuc vouchers can be counted in stanchart simply cash cc? need to hit my min spending,btohqsg
Yes no SG wallet for both Alipay and WeChat pay . From what I know  the Singapore issued credit or debit card linked to the platforms can be used for payment. I have verified with Alipay chat online. Personally  didn't tried. For HK  I can't find anything on Google. Thanks so much for replying with your comments,btohqsg
ok to pay at the service counter right?,btohqsg
There are so many things more worth buying in JP like a PS5 or exclusive collectibles. But must be careful since some of their Sony DAP (ZX707) are volume limited so no one wants one.,btohqsg
Their payment is damn confusing. Like i was downright shocked that a SZ business don‚Äôt accept digital payment from Alipay CN wallet but that is China for you,btohqsg
Precisely your Sz is Suzhou or Shenzhen?,btohqsg
For the SC save up level up program  did anyone get a reply from SC telling you that you are among the first 1 500 people signed up for that?,btohqsg
Shenzhen. Oh and btw SG linked CC unless you have unionpay won‚Äôt be accepted in most retailers in CN. In case you are thinking of using that there. I speak from experience,btohqsg
I have ICBC Singapore issued Union Pay. I would link it to both platforms since u say so üòä,btohqsg
I have ICBC China debit card too. But I can‚Äôt figure out why the ICBC SG account can‚Äôt transfer to ICBC CN. I suspect it is CNY currency control issue,btohqsg
Have u tried using Alipay and WeChat pay in China linked to a Singapore issued credit or debit card before?,btohqsg
Yes but Visa MC limited acceptance all public services (HSR  coaches  metro  etc) won‚Äôt accept it but unionpay should be ok. Only intl 4/5 * hotels and some high end restaurants accept Visa and MC unfortunately.,btohqsg
Just to clarify  from what u wrote the card that is linked to the platform matters. From what I read online  seem to be otherwise üòÇ,btohqsg
Can i asked if anyone who apply CC from either moneysmart or singsaver approved before?ü§£,btohqsg
Dual sim cannot use eSIM haha,btohqsg
Hi  has anyone heard of or tried kilde? Recently been seeing ads for it.,btohqsg
Any advice for no frills short term holiday fund? I only know of CIMB fast savers  any advice welcome,btohqsg
Look like peer to peer lending  doubt is legal and maa regulated,btohqsg
The easiest way to make money thru peer to peer lending is to take a huge loan then default,btohqsg
Never saw this. Is this shown to you after you have an saving acc with them?,btohqsg
This won't seem to look like DBS website/app. You might want to delete the image.,btohqsg
It's apparently shown as licensed on MAS website,btohqsg
Anyone facing this issue using DBS? üôè,btohqsg
Licensed also dont mean cant go wrong. 13.5 return is obviously as high risk.,btohqsg
Applied and got approved for Citi cashback+ MC before.,btohqsg
It's to help fact check the part where you doubted the legality and mas regulated. And they didn't say 13.5% return  only up to. Nowhere said guaranteed also.,btohqsg
Mas liscense and mas regulated is 2 different thing,btohqsg
U can apply for a license to be on mas site as long as u fulfill the criteria and what license it is approved under is not what common people will go check. So using such wording east to attract ppl to jump onboard. How many ppl will bother to go check the company inside out,btohqsg
Look how china peer to peer lending crash,btohqsg
The more we know. üëçüèªüëçüèª Any other examples of companies licenses but not regulated? Just for knowledge.Because based on FAQ on MAS website  they stated that directory of financial institutions are all regulated.,btohqsg
