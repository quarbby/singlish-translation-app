geely made lotus’s don’t inspire confidence at all,btohqsg
it’s built like a conti car in terms of aesthetics  but performs more like kdm,btohqsg
i basically agree with 90% of what you say,btohqsg
"and he will come at you with the ""did you even drive it"" BS",btohqsg
so before i even say anytg abt that  do note that this is more on if you’re more used on driving contis,btohqsg

facts on a sheet are more important when pushing the car to a certain extent,btohqsg
oh wow what a great argument  so i pay 3x the price of a crap chinese ev so it has better dampers. thats definitely gonna win over the buyers,btohqsg
