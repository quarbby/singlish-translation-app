if they get chance for poly why choose higher nitec?,btohqsg
Cannot get into course they want?,btohqsg
as in rp offers higher nitec+ or premium for them (essentially: diploma la),btohqsg
maybe..but from what i can see you learn less in rp than ite,btohqsg
itâ€™s better than higher nitec but lower than poly,btohqsg
like the knowleage you get would be more in ITE,btohqsg
cause for the first two years....you got no first hand experience on anything,btohqsg
i bet ite have better lecturers than rp,btohqsg
lecturers that are better educated no  but better suited to students yes,btohqsg
alot of my ite friends have said that rp's lecturer dont care,btohqsg
like they can give two shits if you decide to just forgo listening or handing up anything,btohqsg
that's why my classmate can fail 4 modules,btohqsg
and still get promoted to y2,btohqsg
because the lecturers are not responsible for the performance of students,btohqsg
nice. make sure u chase them aft u hit the spending to ensure u get it,btohqsg
so even if half a class does badly...they dont get demoted,btohqsg
or get disciplined or get any bad reputation,btohqsg
not fair to the students who study you know,btohqsg
u fail means retain one yr lo for one mod,btohqsg
exactly...but if you really do study  you will be rewarded accordingly,btohqsg
how do u fail a mod? like never do the work or..?,btohqsg
rp same but you still can promote,btohqsg
nice. now I know what card u have hahaha,btohqsg
the friend that failed 4 modules had her graduation date setback 1 yr,btohqsg
hi above comment is for u,btohqsg
i actually have the highest score for my previous national exam because i was the only person in my class who scored less than 20 (l1r4) for oâ€™s... and i was actually rather disappointed when i got my o level results so it was really surprising,btohqsg
Pocoyo big brain.. max 3 page  bro wrote 4 pages,btohqsg
like is it never do work,btohqsg
or got do but not enough,btohqsg
eh legit sia tf man.. i tot I havenâ€™t write enuf !,btohqsg
def better than my teammates statements,btohqsg
either u rlly fail every component,btohqsg
or u never meet attendance requirement,btohqsg
u scared abt ur attendance   js take manadr like my coursemate,btohqsg
i think i said it before,btohqsg
but in rp  6 mc's also fail,btohqsg
bro's writing an essay ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
literally anything is open to appeals for rp,btohqsg
you want to appeal to replace a canteen stall..also can,btohqsg
issok id rather read his essay than my lecturers essay feedback,btohqsg
write & feel like can write more,btohqsg
my classmate was kicked out of sp  he came to rp,btohqsg
yea you can appeal your lecturer also,btohqsg
bro had a 2.8 in sem1 in sp  sem 2 dropped to 0.9,btohqsg
but the thing is my class mostly likes my programming lecturer while i hate him because he doesnt even teach properly,btohqsg
he got the dimisssal letter and he joined my rp batch,btohqsg
so i cant even do anything because nobody will side with me,btohqsg
in rp  you will find lecturers like these one..no choice,btohqsg
my classmate right now in y2 have a lecturer that dont even show slides,btohqsg
he has been complaining to me and my friend group on how tf he is going to do notes,btohqsg
