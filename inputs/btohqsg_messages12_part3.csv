Hi guys any idea when will keys be given for 475B (Yishun melody spring),btohqsg
The completion date was delayed till 2nd Quarter 2022. Not so soon i think,btohqsg
Congrats on the key collection. Are we able to go in and see the flats.,btohqsg

Hi  is there an SBF group chat?,btohqsg
Nono what I mean is.. now it seems u alr collected key  but hear say the area still cordon off. If ur reno done but the area still not exactly ok  can u stay in alr?,btohqsg
476a b c and 477a is phase 2,btohqsg

Phase 2 if delay somemore HDB gg to compensate us already,btohqsg
Ya  476a b dpd is nov 21  476c and 477a is dec 21,btohqsg
Soon. Any news from HDB on compensation?,btohqsg
Nope  cos we are getting our keys,btohqsg
So then mean still within contract.,btohqsg
Yalo  i very puzzled with this.Cos my brother staying at 476A but he havent get key.,btohqsg
Once the first person take key  it means no compensation alr.They can easily say u haven take key cos havent reach ur turn  but system alr give key to first person.,btohqsg

A difference of 6mths,btohqsg
