I dont do musical chairs for my UOB and DBS. But Trust folks may call cos I use it as holding account to earn good interest while waiting for opportunities. 3.5% up to 800k. I can hold a lot of cash inside for standby,btohqsg

Hi I saw mari cc got 2% foreign currency charge and 1% currency conversion fee then the 3% cash back on foreign spending useless,btohqsg
Better with trust cashback card i think,btohqsg
"If I calculateMari cc = (-2%)+(-1%)+3.25% = 0.25%Trust Cashback = (-0.3%)+(1%) = 0.7%Based on my calculation trust is better.Let me know if my calculation is not correctI didn't take trust cashback ""15%"" cos I don't think I spend enough to get that.",btohqsg
mari cc also have exchange gap ah,btohqsg
isn't it in the 3% already?,btohqsg
3% fees then there is exchange rate. Anyway clearly Trust cashback is better,btohqsg
Ok thanks.  Updated the new calculation for reference.Mari cc = +(-0.3%)+(-2%)+(-1%)+3.25% = -0.05%Trust Cashback = (-0.3%)+(1%) = 0.7%,btohqsg
https://www.maribank.sg/fees-rates/mari-credit-cardOk upon further studying the Section B Foreign Currency Transactions NOTEMari cc = +(-0.3%)+(-2%)+(-1%)+3% = -0.3%Trust Cashback = (-0.3%)+(1%) = 0.7%,btohqsg
Not forgetting both have markup from spot rate,btohqsg
Which is the 0.3% I was adding,btohqsg
