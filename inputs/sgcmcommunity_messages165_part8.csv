I have personally done wraps and spray on my cars before.A good wrap nowadays will cost about 2k and good spray upwards of 3k to 5kBoth wraps and spray provide a wide array of colors but for gloss wraps  they do not shine as brightly as a spray job. A matte wrap I think is cheaper than a matte spray.Wraps usually don’t cover the door sills  additional fees involved. So if u pick a color that is vastly different than your stock paint color. The door sills and may look out of place e.g. u have a blue car and want to wrap it red. A spray job will normally include the door sills.Wraps do offer some form of protection on your original paintwork against stone chips and stains etc etc. where as spray is just as it is. However when the wrap is damaged  I can’t just apply putty and do a small spray to cover it  u need to rewrap the entire panel. Depending on the severity of the damage  wrap can cost more than the spray or vice versa. But note that if u spray a non factory color  when u respray a panel  u might not be able to achieve the same shade.Wraps may cause discoloration to your factory paint if constantly under sun  and kept on for 4-5 yrs. especially if stock paint is of poorer quality and usually happens to white. May also cause paint peel off if not removed carefully. Wrap shops do charge extra for removal.Overall it boils down to personal choice and driving habits/routes. If u go nshw often  or off-road  the spray job will probably end up with many stone chips and if u spray red over blue  u might see blue spots underneath. A matte wrap can go weeks without wash and still look relatively ok.If mostly in sg  and under shelter  a spray may serve u better  unless touch wood  damages. But more maintenance if u want to keep it pristine.My 20 cents,btohqsg
Wrap using good 3M material can go upwards of 3k+ also. Using good material can mean longer durability and better finish,btohqsg
Ppf is about 3 times the price of wrap... and is for paint protection... but now got atas ppf with special effects,btohqsg
Wrap will have issue if always park outdoor? Hearsay the wrap might shrink due to frequent exposure from the sun,btohqsg
