Data science and qf sould be q good,btohqsg
Does no favor is a a bit strong la. If I were to contest this statement  I would say it does a bit of favor  but what favor does it do?,btohqsg
Data sci and qf seems fun,btohqsg
Ok la in general easier than chem,btohqsg
There are some harder than others to most ppl,btohqsg
Haha yes yes. My chemistry sucks.,btohqsg
From afar your hair in your dp looks like a beret,btohqsg
Wich are you in your profile pic,btohqsg
The blue lady so cute ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Which question do you not understand,btohqsg
Id suggest posting studies questions in the study group instead,btohqsg
Cause it could get buried here,btohqsg
Why u think i am so pissed,btohqsg
Yea i only see ite student in news,btohqsg
When poly and jc student go,btohqsg
Not such of a big deal lol,btohqsg
Cb last time i 615 queue outside alrdy,btohqsg
What is the traditional route lol,btohqsg
ITE then can go Poly then uni,btohqsg
as long as you can get to uni,btohqsg
Or just donâ€™t aim for uni,btohqsg
Only a child prodigy can do that,btohqsg
Unless you are a chinese child labour@DDxDCx,btohqsg
You are not thinking back far enough,btohqsg
What if everyone has a degree,btohqsg
I can tell  you prefer to be the winner@cauchycriterion,btohqsg
Everybody prefers to be the winner,btohqsg
Then we strive for everyone to get Radians,btohqsg
If u have a degree  u already have Ï€/180 radians,btohqsg
Time to upgrade to solid angles,btohqsg
Imagine the job market can't cater to that many degree holders then they move overseas to find jobs. Then confirm gg lol,btohqsg
Oh  then the problem solves itself,btohqsg
They confirm can't land jobs overseas,btohqsg
The invisible hand of the market wins again,btohqsg
it is not the invisible hand but the mentality of everyone,btohqsg
You forget need to compete with foreigners lol,btohqsg
the invisible hand does not exist,btohqsg
There are a lot of foreigners with degrees also,btohqsg
Then more foreigners take your jobs,btohqsg
Singaporeans canâ€™t compete with foreigners in SG for jobs  but they can do so overseas?,btohqsg
So they wouldnâ€™t go overseas then,btohqsg
Well  thatâ€™s what it would want you to think,btohqsg
Can you imagine being a second class citizen in your own country,btohqsg
I think you should take a look at changi business Park@cauchycriterion,btohqsg
There are a lot of foreigners there doing pmet work,btohqsg
Singapore employs a lot of foreign talent,btohqsg
Singaporeans are capable of doing those jobs lol,btohqsg
Not fair for Singaporeans mah FBPase1,btohqsg
My reply may be a little late but I just wanted to say  donâ€™t feel discouraged!If you have plans to go to Poly then you must know of a course which interests you! You could try out EAE and when youâ€™re accepted  you donâ€™t have to feel as stressed about your resultsOf course youâ€™ll have to continue working hard but the level of stress would be greatly reduced which could benefit you :),btohqsg
I dont have any special talent,btohqsg
