Fdi is negative cuz hot money outflow,btohqsg
im saying in context of this qn,btohqsg
But in real terms it would be not helpful due to singapore's reliance on imports of raw materials for its exports,btohqsg
So the translation cost would still lead to inflation and a diminishing of the export competiveness seen by devaluing the sing dollar,btohqsg
I honestly have no idea what I am saying rn I haven't touch this topic in so long,btohqsg
at least the way i write,btohqsg
Huh no bruh devaluation of sing dollar is useless cuz our exports we still need to import the raw materials,btohqsg
Not necessarily can put it as eval,btohqsg
u see how theres T and AT,btohqsg
nah its an AT to my cher,btohqsg
Na bro it's to say singapore is a trade oriented economy,btohqsg
depending on how u look at it,btohqsg
The thing is that by saying singapore is a trade oriented economy would mean G I and C not rlly relevant for the economy,btohqsg
The multiplier effect in sg too small,btohqsg
yes but ur still not evaluating whether its a positive or negative outcome,btohqsg
no AT capped at band 2,btohqsg

My tutor put more emphasis on RWA analysis,btohqsg
My tutor also have 90% A rate too,btohqsg
I only had private tution cuz I PC,btohqsg
so it is either 100% or 0%,btohqsg
Since n<50  according to the CLT we should reject the alternative hypothesis and declare burette tans conclusion as bullshit,btohqsg

What would the line of best fit be,btohqsg
Got a good night lullaby or not for us,btohqsg
