Honestly i signed up for this because I canâ€™t do Grab driver yet. Need wait about 2 more years then can do. But all in all need extra cash to pay off debt. Thatâ€™s why i ask how much can earn from LLM. Lol.,btohqsg

$4000 / 30 = $133 per day which is about 10 to 15 orders$133 * 0.8 = nett $106 without counting petrol and time valueAfter petrol...I don't even want to see the numbers lol,btohqsg
I drive suv Saturday and Sundays only so after counting fuel and all costs I can profit about $120 each day,btohqsg
OK la lets say one day 250km clockedOn average for a non-hybrid petrol car 10km/L = 25L petrol25 * 2.75 for RON 92 roughly $68 per day petrolSo nett is $38 per day...LOL!,btohqsg
Yea I leave house around 10/11am when got orders and stop when orders end otw home so around 8/9 can reach home,btohqsg
Each day I make $200++ low $200,btohqsg
250km quite reasonable liao  about 20km per order if you take 12.5 orders per day,btohqsg
OK la maybe you halve that if you don't do long distance,btohqsg
still quite low...honestly its same rate as F&B workers at $12/hr...,btohqsg

Oh wow so only Sat & Sun you do and you manage to get that amount?,btohqsg
i think it's fine as a side hustle. but for full-time got more better options than LLM,btohqsg
don't do LLM fulltime unless no choice,btohqsg
Not the best part time side hustle,btohqsg
But as a student with commitments,btohqsg
Donâ€™t take all those long orders  try chain them up,btohqsg
