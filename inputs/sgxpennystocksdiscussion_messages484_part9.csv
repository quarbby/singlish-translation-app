Mm2 Asia selling cinema business. If deal (80m to 120m) doesnâ€™t go through. The deposit of 6m will be converted to mm2 asia shares at premium at $0.080.Quite a decent deal for counter  not vested though.https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/NU7TDQZCEDVMGMNH/676055_20210728%20-%20mm2%20Receives%20Offer%20for%20Cinema%20Business.pdf,btohqsg
No figures. But think they will record a loss on disposal. But this will also greatly reduce the cash flow worries.,btohqsg

Your Morning Quick Read â€“ July 28  2021 Technology Stocks On The RollIt is an exciting week as our favourite technology stocks release their key earnings. Overall  all technology stocks report a robust quarter with increase revenue amid a rosy spending pattern by consumers. As a result  the earnings generally exceed Wall Streetâ€™s estimates  although share prices do not reflect the rosy sentiments.Letâ€™s sink into the report cards.Apple: Fire On all CylindersIt was a blowout quarter for the iPhone makers  for its third-quarter result ended on June 30. Revenue was up 36% from a year ago to reach $81.4 billion  driven by strong demands for its iconic iPhones. This surpassed Wall Streetâ€™s estimate of $72.9 billion by a large margin of about $10 billion.The company reported a profit of $1.30 per share  exceeding the $1 a share expectation. In particular  iPhones sales accounts for nearly 50% of the revenue  well ahead of the $34.2 billion estimates. In addition  growth remains strong across all product categories  such as in Mac  iPad  wearables  home and accessories  and not forgetting the new growth pole: services  as it ended the quarter with more than 700 million paid subscribers using its services portfolio. This is an increase of more than 150 million compared to the prior year.From a geographical perspective  revenues were up across key regions  including America  Europe  Greater China  and Japan  with the rest of Asia growing by 28%. It was a solid quarter on the execution that infuses technology into the everyday life of consumers.Nonetheless  there is the expectation of slowing growth in the next quarter ahead.Alphabet: Reclaiming the Loss GroundThe company hit the jackpot in its record quarterly revenue. The net income was $18.5 billion  which is $27.26 a share. This is a sharp improvement from its net profit of $7 billion or $10.13 a stake in the prior year.Revenue hit a high of $61.9 billion  well ahead of the $56.2 billion estimates. The healthy online activity spurred broad-based spending by advertisers as search  and other revenues account for $35.9 billion. In addition  YouTube ad revenue is a gem that contributes $7 billion to the revenue.Interestingly  the traffic acquisition costs or TAC as commonly known is on the high side. This is the fee that Google typically pays to companies like Apple for the search deals  which amount to $10.9 billion.While the company is expected to have a strong quarter  investors were concerned about a slowing advertising spending or even a reversal. Still  it does not seem the case in the companyâ€™s earning. Similarly to Apple  the numbers are terrific across most of the business segments.In Particular  Pika World likes Googleâ€™s Cloud computing segment  which had a rise of 50%in revenue to reach $4.6 billion. It has a smaller operating loss of $591 million  which is a dramatic drop from $1.4 billion a year ago.Overall  it was a splendid quarter!*Microsoft: An Upbeat Guidance Against Dark Clouds**The company posted revenue of $46.2 billion  a rise from $44.1 billion  a 21% increase. Profits stood at $2.17 per share  exceeding the consensus of $1.90 per share. In addition  the company had seen firmer growth across its three operating segments.First  the Productivity and Business Processes that include Office were up 25% in revenue to hit $14.05 billion  ahead of the guidance of $13.8 billion.Second  Intelligent Cloud Revenue  which includes the brand Azure  rose 30% to reach $17.4 billion  beating $16.2 billion. Notably  this business segment had exceeded the Productivity business segment.Lastly  the Personal Computing segments  which includes the all-time favourite  Windows  Xbox and Surface  reached $14.1 billion in revenue  also ahead of the forecast range of $13.6 billion.,btohqsg
As we review Linkedin business  the revenue was up 46%  with the ad revenue bringing in $1 billion for the first time. The business is bringing in a gain of more than $10 billion annually.As a whole  Microsoft continued to deliver a set of healthy results and an almost impeccable executions strategy.It is July 28  Wednesday  8.25 am in Singapore. It was a wild ride yesterday. Stay tuned as we bring you more insights into the market pulse.Cheers  Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a larger audience.,btohqsg
