but th safety features and fuel efficiency all good ah,btohqsg

I see some western website says Mazda 6 expensive to repair. Is it true in sg too? I know that mazda 3 is cheap cause many phv using  but never heard the same for Mazda 6.,btohqsg
That time when I was looking for 2nd hand car  one of the car dealer was telling me Mazda sky active engine some of the older model have engine oil leaking issue  dunno solve already or not,btohqsg
See mileage and whether pistons overworked boh..,btohqsg
Repair what? Does it mentioned petrol or diesel?,btohqsg
I can no longer find the article now  but I remember the article mentioned it was back when Mazda have partnership with ford. It says that ford completely left Mazda from 2015 onwards  some of the older model (pre 2015) uses old ford parts which is not known to be reliable. Some of these parts are also hard to get  hence increase the cost of maintaining the vehicle.,btohqsg
It's water under the bridge. Wondering why the interest. Mazda fared much better on its own without Ford.,btohqsg
Wah!! How come have the M buttons! Which model are you driving sir!,btohqsg
F30. learning to install these small pieces,btohqsg
At that point of time  those are the cars that I can buy. So all those info are important to me. Just like how Hyundai and Kia still have bad connotation due to their bad past  buyers will still be worried,btohqsg
I doubt kia and Hyundai has such stigma now compared to the days of Hyundai pony. Just like how many are buying LG TV knowing how bad the quality were during Goldstar era,btohqsg
Ya la  but at that point of time as a first time buyer I rather choose something safer than a brand with a bad connotation to it,btohqsg
And it doesn't help that the seller I went to also reinforce that idea the engine oil leak,btohqsg
So immediately strike it off at that juncture,btohqsg
Can I stack this two together and get 15%?,btohqsg

Every dealer is out to scam you. Do your homework,btohqsg
I think restaurants are also scammer. 1 whole Cabbage 50 cents. Sell u half of it at $12,btohqsg
Extra 3 due to COE renewal and car plate retention> what the hell does this even mean? Last i checked  renewing COE and retaining plate does not change owner count. that car and that ad is a walking red flag,btohqsg
More ex to maintain as compared to  honda? Yes,btohqsg
I think it is reliable. Any car can be reliable.. or not. Up to owners.,btohqsg

I think retain carplate will add owner count de leh,btohqsg
I’ve seen more 7’s than A8’s in upscale estates but that’s not to say A8’s inferior? As much 7’s I’ve seen  there’re a number of them with faulty air susp,btohqsg
Take S class better or LS500,btohqsg
If have enough dough to buy A8 or 740 reliability not a concern anymore... Just buy whichever car you like driving more lol,btohqsg

Lamborghini heads to Oman for some Arabian magicThe latest Lamborghini driving experience sees a convoy of the Urus S Super SUV driving through the roads and sands of Oman.➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
I remember if u take a loan for coe renewal  it adds one leh,btohqsg
My dealer told me that also,btohqsg
Transfer to dealer is considered one count right? Then dealer to new owner is another count?,btohqsg
Or transferring to dealer is nt counted,btohqsg
LOL thats between you and the loan company. Not how it works when you actually extend. Kena con. I renewed coe myself…twice…and it never added to the owner count,btohqsg
The guy giving loan probably did some funny thing to ensure he didnt pay for your renewal then u run away,btohqsg
If some guy ask me add owner count to my vehicle to renew coe i would ask him to get lost and find someone else,btohqsg
Anyway this is easily proven. There a lots of single owner cars more than 10 years old. Meaning coe renewed  no addition to owner count. Here is just one examplehttps://m.sgcarmart.com/used_cars/info.php?ID=1244220&utm_content=SLeligible,btohqsg
This from SGCM. Coe renewals thru finance companies incur an additional owner count,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/business/no-one-wants-used-evs-making-new-ones-a-tougher-sell-tooshared by couple of folks this morning.  Breakfast food for thought indeed.....,btohqsg
yeah， i try this for one og my car. the process is seamless,btohqsg
This is imposed by finance companies and not required for coe renewal,btohqsg
yes  my car coe renewed by sgcm  finance by toyota finance,btohqsg
the car has to transfer to them first then transfer back,btohqsg
the whole process done seamlessly  including insurance. such a breeze,btohqsg
I realise why they might do this. They dont want to put the coe money in your pocket and trust you to renew the coe. you might run off with the money or use it for something else. So you transfer the car to them  they renew it  then transfer the vehicle back to you? Still  i dont like this system at all  it screws with your car value to add owner count,btohqsg
But if you need a loan to renew then i guess you dont have a choice,btohqsg
actually they let me choose hong leong or toyota,btohqsg
Overhauling a battery is expensive i guess,btohqsg
hong leong loan add to your tdsr toyota did not. best part 100% financinf no q&A,btohqsg
Or they wan to wash away phv record,btohqsg
my case is handled by mary ann she is really good,btohqsg
I mean when PQP was 30k 40k makes sense to full cash,btohqsg
Transfer to dealer doesn't add count  unless something dubious,btohqsg
But now its 100k.. makes more sense to use loan imho,btohqsg
Within 1 cycle can change 3 times and became 6 owner? The past owners so cham meh?,btohqsg

hello   just wanna ask when normally y'all buy car   must downpayment first ?,btohqsg
Look like Yaris cross. Jialat sia  all mini crossover SUV look like Yaris cross to me now,btohqsg
Yes  I think all AD will request for deposit when you made your purchase,btohqsg
You see sg carmart the new car brochures  all the brochures have the T&C that they will collect some money from you,btohqsg
U need to get your eye checked,btohqsg
Ya sia  damn Yaris cross living in my head rent free,btohqsg
Think its gg to be a $230k car,btohqsg
But C loses its round iconic mini eyes,btohqsg
Planning what car to buy after i win the 5th Jan toto,btohqsg
Lol deposit definitely  but down-payment depends. If you go AD  cannot escape down-payment 30% or 40%. If you go dealer or PI  they will ask you if you are going for full loan  higher or lower than the 30% or 40% down-payment (if that's what you're asking),btohqsg
Deposit must be careful what the terms are  especially if you send for ppi and found some issues that you are unwilling to proceed with the sale  will full refund or not,btohqsg
Dealers that doesn't entertain ppi or say ppi dun need or no refund of deposit  walk away......,btohqsg
Yes. Only agree if they allow u to refund due to car inspection less than A or B,btohqsg
Oh the A or B is quite basic inspection  lolz many bros here feel not sufficient. It's the ppi that's more indepth  e.g. whether gearbox any signs of damage  any leaks  etc,btohqsg
After discount n stuff 258k liao AHAHAHA,btohqsg
Why go for Alphard when u have the Lexus,btohqsg
I dont do PHV for a living,btohqsg
Loan approve then pay PI $29k for downpayment,btohqsg
The price of one can buy ALPHARD with spare change for another Camry,btohqsg
Price of one Alphard can buy one Noah w spare change for a Vios,btohqsg
Lexus LM to Alphard isn’t similar to an Alphard to a Noah,btohqsg
I think most of us can agree on that,btohqsg
Jazz also very exp. At $150k,btohqsg
What’s expensive to u may be cheap to others,btohqsg
Then ur argument not valid alrdy lor,btohqsg
what about 4 Wheels Drive Pte Ltd,btohqsg
I have the budget for X. Why would u go for W,btohqsg
If u recommend Y  mayb i will consider,btohqsg
I think also depends on whether you know of any reliable workshop  and whether you prefer barebone model (PI) or customised model (AD),btohqsg
I want buy Corolla Cross. U ask me buy Yaris Cross.,btohqsg
If u say say Rav 4  then its worth considering,btohqsg
So PI got full spec hor,btohqsg
AD model is usually a lot of have and have not  PI model usually is bare and you can opt to have whatever you want,btohqsg
Original japan HU tht cannot be used in SG,btohqsg
I’m sorry I no interested in ur hypothetical story,btohqsg
does anyone know this brand ?,btohqsg
I’m sorry I no story to share,btohqsg
👍 if Buy from AD servicing there damn expensive cos they check every screw which I think is not necessary  but the parts they use is original la. Buy from pi after their warranty period you can go your own ws,btohqsg
A lot of talk about expensive cars.  But how many here can afford it?,btohqsg
They forgot to put back my plastic tray at the bottom,btohqsg
Call me to ask me go back,btohqsg
pi stands for parallel importer ?,btohqsg
@dexterI think if you wanna be safe  can go carro or opt for those with sgcarmart warranty or even borneo motors own 2nd hand  or sime darby etc,btohqsg
Just saying la  that they check a lot of things and charge you for it,btohqsg
As long as go for bigger PIs  u shld be safe,btohqsg
Or nvr check n charge u,btohqsg
Initially it was a discussion what car to buy if Jason win the 4D,btohqsg
No lo  got black sheep one  I kena one from car times leh,btohqsg
I got mine from Borneo motor 2nd hand. Inchcape certified something. I still need to replace my wear and tear . The only thing is that the engine seems to be ok (so far),btohqsg
Their sales person  and the ws also can't solve my car problem also,btohqsg
Yah inchcape certified I believe is more reliable ba,btohqsg
Oh wear and tear definitely can't escape  so some bros here suggest hold back 10k from your down-payment for these replacements lol,btohqsg
Ya lor  I damn kuku cause first car so I don't know shit,btohqsg
Gearbox and engine problem is not wear and tear  so be careful of any dealer giving this nonsense,btohqsg
End up spend like thousands changing stuff after getting the car,btohqsg
Join the chat group to know more about your car and get recommendations for ws,btohqsg
Lol I also  changed steering column rack  rear wheel bearings  lower arm,btohqsg
So must reduce risk of encountering one,btohqsg
Wheel bearing I also kena  I suspect soon my brake pad also need to change,btohqsg
But i think now better alrdy,btohqsg
The worst is the original camera they gave  don't even work lol,btohqsg
They have their own workshop. last time they partner w dubious workshop,btohqsg
Lol I flushed brake fluid 3 times within 3 months cos after changing brake fluid my brake piston stuck due to poor maintenance by previous owner,btohqsg
Or  like the car times sales person charge me almost 400 for a 2nd hand iroad,btohqsg
They always like that one  if you don't know anything about it will kena chop damn badly,btohqsg
Yah I didn't check the receipts properly lo,btohqsg

If nt  u need to find out urself then u approach them,btohqsg
They will say have recall meh,btohqsg

The above is newbie buyer la  the laochiao ones would venture where others dun dare to 😂😂😂,btohqsg
10-20yrs ago buy PI is worry PI close shop,btohqsg
@dexterI think you can find out how much things such as dashcam  hu how much in 2nd hand market  then see if you wan to get it yourself so you won't kena chop,btohqsg
Cos if brand new cannot be near same price as 2nd hand one,btohqsg
