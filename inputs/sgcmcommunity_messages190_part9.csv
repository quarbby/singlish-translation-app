The only person I know that drives a volvo,btohqsg
Can change. But if its not your fault  make sure the insurer change back the status and reinstate your ncd,btohqsg
If say your insurer deem is your fault and minus ncd  even if you jump to another insurer  the new insurer will follow the ncd declared by your existing one,btohqsg
The insurers share the same record database.,btohqsg
Recently   I also got into accident . But my insurer did not increase my premium.,btohqsg
I haven't heard of insurer increasing premium halfway through the coverage period though.,btohqsg
Since when I 1st purchased the car   I sign up a 4 yrs insurance coverage . Contract auto renewal upon ending the 1st yr contract .,btohqsg

No need to go around asking for quotes . Plus my other cars all lock down 3-5 yrs . As long as the insurer allow  it should be fine,btohqsg

Isn’t it obvious  can car was clearly in a left turn only lane.,btohqsg
the line on the road is for the next lane right,btohqsg
AH ok my bad u mean follow the dotted line to turn,btohqsg
Can car looks more like it was going straight  and the dotted line is so far ahead  doesn’t make sense to follow,btohqsg
2nd lane seems to be pointing straight only,btohqsg
cam car following dotted line as set by LTA,btohqsg
i dun see why should biker be triggered,btohqsg
nowadays who ever triggered first seems to win,btohqsg
This is Bayfront Ave turning into Marina Boulevard if im not wrong.2nd lane is a go straight turn left lane.Cam car is correct. Bike went into cam car’s lane. 🫤,btohqsg
follow line wrong  don't follow line also wrong,btohqsg
Lol the bike has to ah  else how to turn 🤭,btohqsg
Anyway he signal liao  so no harm looking out to avoid accident  plus cam car not a long vehicle ba  why make a wide turn?,btohqsg
Because he can  motorbike is in the wrong..,btohqsg
if you look at the 2nd junction ahead  you will understand why they made the 1st junction road marking in such a way,btohqsg
after the left turn the first 2 lanes on the left are left only,btohqsg
obviously that's why the turning lane marker design choice is because of that,btohqsg
