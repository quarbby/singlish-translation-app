Petition for Imran as specimen no.1,btohqsg
but his vezel still faster than fd2r,btohqsg
Julian will beg to differ hahaha,btohqsg
is the driver not the car,btohqsg
Where’s Pete when we need his ideas?,btohqsg
Hi Jonathan  thanks for this. We will do our best to do used cars. Problem we're facing is that the used car dealers are not willing to lend us due to the increment of mileage when we do the videos. We will nevertheless try and work something out. Thanks again. 🙏🏼,btohqsg
I’m no dealer but I have something that can help kick start the series. Don’t mind the exposure,btohqsg
Always liked your reviews! The descriptions and your opinions on the car design and practicality really helped. Keep up the great work,btohqsg
Maybe he can start with all your 10 cars!,btohqsg
Yeah this is better also. If the publicity turn out to be very beneficial. Dealers may fight for slots for the free advert haha,btohqsg
Sold to make way for bugaboo,btohqsg
If u know what I mean haha,btohqsg
I’m not the one with 10 cars hahaha,btohqsg
Haha sgcm looking for dealers willing to lent their inventory for shoot,btohqsg
Or is it the other m3 owner that had lunch at my place?,btohqsg
Of course sir. I just grew out of one 5 years ago,btohqsg
Hahaha not that la. Was referring to the McLaren stroller hahahaha. Not having anymore kids. Factory closed!,btohqsg
I am currently not holding enough for them to shoot tho,btohqsg
Haha haven’t been there for ages. But it wasn’t me,btohqsg
Why so many m3 owners go your place one?,btohqsg
Tho drop me a dm on the types if you all require maybe i can put you in touch with a dealer with one,btohqsg
Short uncle drive m3?! He can reach the pedal plus look over the steering wheel or not,btohqsg
So cute can only see his head from the window,btohqsg
Actually m3 is made for shorter people. The brake pedal is tiny af,btohqsg
Or because m3 don’t need brakes,btohqsg
Small nvm  as long can use,btohqsg
It’s not that. They have nothing to prove. Pedal small so easy and nimble to step,btohqsg
Cos m3 slow la hahah. Take forever to build rpm,btohqsg
Launch every time you stop! Hahaha 🚀,btohqsg
Now so bright  everyone will know it’s me,btohqsg
For one  need more in-depth information on cars. Example  back then I wanted to know whether cars come with sunroof or not but seems like it’s not a talking point  unless it’s high end stuff like Harrier’s panoramic roof with dimming.Think when you talk about leg room and headroom of interior  should have rough measurement or something. Some people might have shorter torso and longer body but still have same height as the speaker.Then for example the recent M3 video  not much was talked about in regards to interior storage compartment like glove box and Center consoleAlso claim FC usually abit off from actual FC  should have actual driving FC leh. My A4 MHybrid claims to have 16km/l but I’m usually hitting around 10-11km/l,btohqsg
Oh IS THIS THE IM 1.6m tal and i fit just nice in the backseat? Haha,btohqsg
HAHAHA ya like my wife hor also around that height but she’s like why the legroom not as advertised ah  not very comfy,btohqsg
Then when I open my A4 glovebox I realise it’s a tiny compartment taken up mostly by an already outdated cd player. Like hello 2021 why you still here,btohqsg
honestly so far the car reviews are great but I’m seeing alot high end performance car rather than Cat A cars. Mostly its been cat B and cat B and cat B. Hopefully more videos on used cars because thats where most of us are buying the cars from.I think maybe better video angles on dashboard would be nice  cus most of the time I’m seeing it from the side  would be nice to see it from the driver perspective. Maybe wear helmet camera or go pro to zoom in at some features relating to the car?If can open bonnet to have a quick view would be nice  like 6 sec shot then saying the bhp and how much torque it can produce.,btohqsg
Hais if only BMW got 3 series in the style of M3 touring,btohqsg
I dun like the touring leh,btohqsg
Wa shit i nearly bang someone  at night wear all black bike no lights zz,btohqsg
I like station-wagon style sia plus that rear window can open up. Tempted to just downgrade to A4 Avant B9 sia  got no upgraded MMI but still worth the practicality,btohqsg
But the back especially the diffuser is ugly,btohqsg
Wai Wai Wai  I like leh,btohqsg
But either way most people will mod it anyway  maybe can put those hexagon exhaust in the middle type one,btohqsg
When I saw it  it reminded me of lancalution exhaust diffuser cut outs,btohqsg
Honestly wish they design that better,btohqsg
But I would still buy it la  if I had the money,btohqsg
Hello pulis. Coz you typing away on sgcm sima?,btohqsg
Wa cyclist w no lights at night issa nogo,btohqsg
Shhhhhh  that one also cannot blame me la  I want faster clear u turn,btohqsg
Scared later people purposely drive into me and claim me,btohqsg
Hit jiu hit lah no problem one sir. It happens,btohqsg
Don’t laugh people. Matter of time one. Later mrs karma make it happen sooner than later hor,btohqsg
Important is its luckily an easy fix. One day job.,btohqsg
Cannot la actually my insurance already Sky high,btohqsg

Insurance + Road Tax + Maintenance + Petrol + Car,btohqsg
Basically I just take it as my per month everything included is 3.5-4kEach day drive 2-3 premium trips then go home lo. If I don’t feel like driving  at most take from my savings or salary.Anyway end of the day doesn’t really matter to me,btohqsg
I do it for the sake of not wanting to pay for a car because I feel that’s it’s just a tool  so convert lor.If I compared last year when I drove vezel to cover cost  technically the entire year I only paid $2k out of my pocket?,btohqsg
Wa i hate waze idiots. Nothing still keep report n report,btohqsg
Ya annoying  they want points for idk what reason,btohqsg
By the way I don’t see any traffic cam report in Malaysia leh,btohqsg
Not sure if waze is freq used in msia,btohqsg

Hi. Can i get some advise. Buying new vehicle like motorbike and car they will get the last 6 months average of COE?,btohqsg
I've learnt the hard way that the magnetic shades don't go well with the desire to drive with window open. Had one on my 116d  drove a bit too fast only it flew out of the bracket and hit me in the face,btohqsg
So to confirm buying new vehicles is 3 months average COE we are paying then?,btohqsg
https://www.facebook.com/RoyalMotorGrandeur?mibextid=LQQJ4dhttps://www.facebook.com/carchoicesg?mibextid=LQQJ4dAnyone got experience getting their car with these two ?,btohqsg
Mine flew out of my elantra HAHAH,btohqsg
They selectively sell car to you based on how much loan you choose to take.,btohqsg
If those car dealer keep pushing u for 70 to 100% loan. Its red flag becos u will pay more than the current selling price in the future and they can earn big fat commission from you.,btohqsg
Always buy within ur preferred finances,btohqsg
No one knows best except urself,btohqsg
MAS and bank max is 70%,btohqsg
More than 70% is their in house loan which they charge u 3 to 4 % interest rate.,btohqsg
"When u see those dealer advertisement put ""ex bankruptcy  high risk etc. are welcome""   it means they will loan you from their own finance department but charge u higher interest. Not the bank",btohqsg
That's why car dealers and property agent commission fee so fat  becos they work with bank to lure us into their high interest loan scheme. This is business and its dirty but legit,btohqsg
Yes last time my magnet shade flew out hit people  also cannot put my arm out,btohqsg
No good the RoyalMotor smt  hard sell to the max,btohqsg
"Just a tip  when u browse for car in sgcarmart or any website   don't just look at the car picture. See their description. If they put ""100% loan avaliable  0 down-payment   in house loan avaliable or ex bankruptcy welcome etc.""    I would avoid them if I were u as they will typically play with the admin fee  penalty charges and interest rate just to get u sign the 70 to 100% loan.",btohqsg
If u take less than 50% loan even though u have plenty of cash to pay down payment  the dealer will increase their admin fee and penalty charges. Then u r paying more than their advertised price.,btohqsg
"Their ""admin"" fee is their kopi money. Its pure nonsense.",btohqsg
Their admin paperwork only requires loan agreement  sales agreement  insurance quote and LTA transfer ownership. All these I also can do myself online,btohqsg
Then I would suggest you get cars from direct sellers,btohqsg
I wouldn’t mind paying the admin fee for them to do my paperwork,btohqsg
If u have the money. 1k to 3k admin fee,btohqsg
Full loan is the way to go,btohqsg
U must be a dealer I suppose,btohqsg
But I always full loan my car 👍🏼,btohqsg
Problem with direct is Lemon Law doesnt apply,btohqsg
Yeah but he doesn’t want to pay admin fee,btohqsg
U can get direct or non direct seller to do PPI,btohqsg
But at the end of the day  if within 6 months something piang and its not wear n tear,btohqsg
U have some recourse under a dealer than a direct owner,btohqsg
Not true. Some mechanics may anyhow say ur car problem not due to engine and gearbox so not cover under warranty,btohqsg
Don't believe in the warranty too much,btohqsg
Few have complained in a car forum about their 6 months warranty is useless,btohqsg
Cus if the dealer dw to negotiate with u,btohqsg
Also not much but time wastage nia. So as u repair u keep records of documentation,btohqsg
Its becus yall dw fight all the way thats why the dealers think consumers easy to bully.,btohqsg
Everything No use No use. I rather try rather than just give up,btohqsg
Wa my Pete sense is tingling,btohqsg
i think pete making me short fused sometimes,btohqsg
End of day just know what car you buying,btohqsg
Full loan or dw admin fee,btohqsg

Yeap. Im happy w my current car sial,btohqsg
I never had so much fun hearing my air intake,btohqsg

I feel the same way about everything 😏,btohqsg
Then how the plebs see the handsum driver of that chio car ?!?,btohqsg

not everything cheap is best... this fella kena poisoned by pete liao,btohqsg
Aft tint can put back camera anot,btohqsg
They say cannot put for a week,btohqsg
You also cannot roll down window but you gonna do it anyways,btohqsg
sg shop all put back the camera and IU for you,btohqsg
all i can say is... you pay peanuts expect monkeys,btohqsg
I go JB do cus cheaper with better UV and IRR,btohqsg
I gna Step out of the car,btohqsg
Ask them on battery mode also can ah  that time I ask the tinting guy don’t waste my petrol LOL,btohqsg
That will damage your battery too,btohqsg
Anyway the tint curing 2 days idk how true is that leh  I exit out of shop I forget the rule already then roll down  till this date still no issue,btohqsg
Some shops they lock my window for me,btohqsg
But custom also don’t car one haha,btohqsg

Okay nvm i alr queuing to come back SH,btohqsg
Can U just let the Popo move in😂😂,btohqsg
Just found out taxi can cross custom,btohqsg
Cannot  reasoning simpleIf he cut in  I cannot filter to the right because behind him is a blue lorry and a motorbike is attempting to cut from behind. I would therefore be stuck in lane 4 behind a huge as popo who would also be super slow and a big blindspot,btohqsg
If I go thru his front  I can filter out while he filter in without any issue while the motorbike behind me can also be in whichever lane,btohqsg
I wish leh  else won’t get road bullied,btohqsg
Maybe A4 not aggressive looking enough,btohqsg
You already see him changing lane yet you wanna squeeze in,btohqsg
Lucky you horn if not confirm you gg,btohqsg
Just wait for them to pass then change lane lah,btohqsg
I’m still travelling straight in my lane while he’s filteringIf he side swipe me he still at fault,btohqsg
Must give chance to bigger vehicles,btohqsg
Rule of thumb: no contact/accident best. Dc who at fault. Car go workshop not fun,btohqsg
Like how U taught me how to USE MY OWN CAR FUNCTIONS,btohqsg
For me different leh  if kena accident I get to go on holidayLoss of income + medical expenses etc,btohqsg
Repaint my car free of charge,btohqsg
So you’re the type to claim gao gao,btohqsg
You’re contributing to the rising cost of insurance,btohqsg
Next time accident .. u call sky,btohqsg
I give chance private settle if the people not guai lan and really is accidentIf you wanna challenge me and cause an accident of course I’ll go full out,btohqsg
Me give a lot of people private settle before lehh last time  don’t any how accuse leh haha,btohqsg
like verbally say private settlement then afterwards MIA or suddenly tell diff story to own insurance,btohqsg
Take picture of the accident etcTell them tomorrow I’ll go down to workshop get quote  if you’re okay with the amount and want to private settle then just transfer meElse we can claim insurance  if they run or don’t pay up I still have evidence of accident mah,btohqsg
Tell diff story but got dashcam lo  don’t pay up just claim insurance lo,btohqsg
End of the day if I give chance and they wanna play games I’ll just claim Gao gao,btohqsg
From that video I can say maybe@historyofmannot the koyak one lol,btohqsg
Won't hurt anyone to see a truck already on the line getting in my lane  slow down and merge behind him,btohqsg
Hais you all still don’t get it even after I explain cannot filter out if he enter,btohqsg
I also nothing to say liao,btohqsg
Can what  just wait until the the vehicles pass by,btohqsg
Then I’ll kena slow down what,btohqsg
Rear cam you can see if I let him go  motor filter out and blue truck catch up  I’ve to wait how many more cars to filter out,btohqsg
You were clearly at a much faster speed in the slow Lane boss.,btohqsg
his speed definitely faster than the filter lane limit of 50 (general),btohqsg
Doesn’t matter car at lane 4 go 100km or what  if it’s not safe to filter  you can’t filter what,btohqsg
you never post onto SGRV right  you post i assure you kena hantam one confirm,btohqsg
No lah  just be more defensive lor. If have to wait  just wait bro,btohqsg
No la but kena hamtam by you guys I sad liao  cannot understand perspective of faster car one,btohqsg
yup  heavy vehicles full of blind spots  and their inertia is way more than yours,btohqsg
If you pete  we don’t care one,btohqsg
onus is on you to give way  your safety is more important than any kind of right of way,btohqsg
Me different leh  if kena whack then whack can upgrade car mah. Somemore no need go work still can get paid,btohqsg
2 income stream while not working  buey shiok meh,btohqsg
My car kena scratch I heart pain already,btohqsg
if the truck never see you change lane too fast is not about winning claim or not already... your family burn you a porsche GT3RS for you to use,btohqsg
no accidents  whether you at fault or not is worth getting into,btohqsg
not say won't happen but if you ask for it... definitely not worth,btohqsg

Thanks bro  yes Nano Ionization is beneficial for all engines. Our unique nano fuel saver and performance booster product comes in the form of a nano ionizer material (flexible variant) from Germany that is specifically formulated to help with the molecular fragmentation and ionization of air + fuel + stabilized enhancement of spark firing power & electricity supply to electronics & components.Nano Ionization helps fuel combustion process to be naturally cleaner and more efficient which is found to improve the power and fuel efficiency based on the usual air and fuel mixture as originally determined by the ECU settings which does not compromise fuel consumption even when driving faster.Results are immediate (right after installation) and is safe for warranty and is LTA compliant as there are no modifications or replacement of any parts done. Installation is done by custom sizing and securely pasting the nano ionizer material to fit the existing components related to fuel combustion process.You can check out our Facebook reviews section to have a better idea of the effects as shared by some of our customers who took time to post their results@gewinnensingaporeFor more of our stories on the challenging journey of Nano Ionization since 2019  you can check out our website atgewinnen.sgWe actually started in 2018 with cars owned by our friends😊 It was really tough to market a first ever product that can generate more horsepower without modifications or tuning while being able to reduce fuel consumption 😅There are a total of 4 major points where we can install the nano ionizer material such as the air intake system  ignition coil pack  fuel supply line and electrical cables.Each point helps to contribute towards a cleaner and more efficient fuel combustion process for better power and fuel efficiency results.🔵Stage 1 is the nano ionization of the air intake system to breakdown and ionise air molecules before the throttle body so that more mass of oxygen molecules can be packed in the same volumetric air flow to help with more efficient ignition and combustion of fuel to reduce performance lag or hesitation. It helps to improve throttle response and acceleration too.🔵Stage 1+2 includes nano ionization of the ignition coil pack for the stabilized enhancement of the direct electric flow to the spark plugs beneath for more efficient firing power so that all chambers will be able to combust fuel more efficiently and consistently to improve the power and fuel efficiency further.🔵Stage 1+2+3 includes nano ionization of the high pressure fuel supply line to breakdown and ionise fuel molecules to improve the combustion state to be cleaner and more efficient which helps to improve power and fuel efficiency further from 1+2.🔵Stage 1+2+3+4 includes nano ionization of the power supply cables and connecting points to enhance electrical flow to electronics  mechanic hardwares and grounding to improve the overall functions and fuel combustion efficiency.🔵Stage 5 custom add on to concentrate more nano ionizing power for preferred components (depending on available space)You can install one or more points at a time or all points at once according to your preference.⭐Promo $150/stage to install (while stocks last for this promo batch)Effects can last for 10 years according to the warranty given to us by our supplier. I have used it for 4 years+ already and the OBDII readings and results are still consistent.The stages help to burn fuel cleaner to cleanest accordingly to produce additional power and torque from the usual fuel injection volume and air mixture as originally determined by the ECU to push the distance further or arrive at destinations faster without consuming as much fuel as before.The Nano Ionizer material is custom sized and securely pasted to fit the mentioned components related to fuel combustion process. It is safe for both warranty and Vicom/STA inspection as no modifications and replacement of any parts are done.,btohqsg

Got to twist your question a bit.,btohqsg
Minister of tpt giving statement of coe prices,btohqsg
#PSA📢 We will be making a one-time adjustment to reduce the volatility in#COEquota for Categories A and B.From the second bidding exercise this quarter on 15 May 2023  we will bring forward guaranteed deregistrations of 5-year non-extendable COEs  which are due to expire when supply is projected to be higher and redistribute them over the next few quarters.The COE quota for May 2023 to July 2023 will be increased to 10 431. Category A will see an increase of 24% while Category B will see an increase of 15% for the remaining five bidding exercises for this quarter.More details above.,btohqsg
Wait does it mean LTA didnt release quota for 5 year coe PQP until they were officially de registered previously?,btohqsg
This is incorrect releasing of quota,btohqsg
Becus 5 yr coes are guaranteed to be deregistered and released back into the pool,btohqsg
They shud have factored them in into subsequent quota during bidding,btohqsg
Doesn’t make sense right to only include when dereg. Becoz they are guaranteed to dereg,btohqsg
Eg car deregistered in May  quota shud be release in June alr,btohqsg
Omg wapiang that means coe demand and supply prev fr prev quarters wasnt really due to demand and supply,btohqsg
They created the demand and supply accidentally,btohqsg
Resulting in a low supply high demand,btohqsg
Expiring 5-year COEs will be redistributed to smoothen supply of Category A and B COEs: IswaranThe one-off re-distribution  starting from the next bidding exercise  will be done over several quarters and will increase quota supply in the next bidding exercise by 24% in Category A and 15% in Category B.https://bt.sg/5HsW,btohqsg
Wonder how low will the premiums go,btohqsg
Every ah mao ah kow will go in and buy now,btohqsg
It's the practice all along...only deregister then pour back..doesn't matter 5yr or those who decided to scrap at 10 etc,btohqsg
My concern is the pqp lol,btohqsg
But the concern here is why wasnt 5 year coe poured back in imemdiately the next month when it is confirmed to be deregistered?,btohqsg
So the supply could have been higher,btohqsg
Eg June 1st bidding has 500,btohqsg
So which quarter is the may 31st coming back into?,btohqsg
So early already talk so atas,btohqsg
then bertha hanson also talk about it,btohqsg
We sit down and relax also,btohqsg
High or low still will buy car 🤣,btohqsg
Physical car still around ma 🤭 the congestion would only get worse  carparks not enough  etc,btohqsg
That's why this round is a one time,btohqsg
Just now I saw a red plate Audi A6 SNJ xxx,btohqsg
Red plate is additional discount ?,btohqsg

If I rich  I buy lambo red plate,btohqsg

I too sad liao so I very less come back here 🥲,btohqsg
Aiyo hahaha like that also need to sad meh,btohqsg

walau we say u cus we care for u. if its pete  we just say pls continue go ahead,btohqsg
i think 4 or 5 only,btohqsg
cus my friend recently got married,btohqsg
I think I buy 20 today,btohqsg
i ask him draw numbers for me,btohqsg
Clever.  Remove cow volatility when record high… clock more high COE units… as ppl still need to buy.. grab will grab the chance… come 2-3 yrs time when supply suppose to increase n bring prices down? There won’t be anymore surplus due to zero growth and all used up,btohqsg
No point asking from ChatGPT if you want to ask for random number  is equivalent to quick pick.You can be more direct and ask for probability instead such that they actually calculate what’s the most likely to come out.Chances of winning will be closer if it’s 4D than ToTo.In the case of 4D you can ask what’s the highest probability of 10 number from 0000 to 9999 appearing in a random list of 23 numbers when rolled 23 times  removing the numbers when appeared.If you wanna factor in 4D Machine etc  can make your own AI do the calculations with the past 4D results,btohqsg
I think just buy . The price won’t comes down so much . Currently the 2 most tax the gov can depend on is car & housing .,btohqsg
i heard in US one lottery went bankrupt cus a grp of uni students did this,btohqsg
what u want is buy iToto,btohqsg
but prize pool divided by 28,btohqsg
i think what u should do is buy multiple qp  the odds r higher,btohqsg
If win 1mil then you keep reinvesting the winnings,btohqsg
reinvest into other stocks or investment plans yes,btohqsg
i always reinvest but nvr win HAHAH,btohqsg
Technically you don’t lose any money what,btohqsg
u lose ur initial deposit lo,btohqsg
i net loss $42 so far,btohqsg
i think 50 or 60 dollars,btohqsg
You see my lost confirm you crt,btohqsg
