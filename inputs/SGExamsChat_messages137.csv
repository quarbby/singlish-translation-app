Who feels they should have late afternoon say 3pm lessons till 10pm?,btohqsg
Rather go back to lower primary (tho no longer applicable now) schedule  the extras are before class rather than after class.,btohqsg
Assume each lesson last 45min to 1 hour. So u can have > 4 lessons per day after including break,btohqsg
1pm to 8pm is a logistical headache for dinner  what time is dinner break? 6 - 1 more hour of lesson then end le  what for? 5 - too early lah.,btohqsg
That’s what Others is there for,btohqsg

How can I study for elect lit,btohqsg
Umm unseen poetry (from the perspective of y1) remember lit devices  rhyme scheme  prepare some simple rhymes???,btohqsg
im in poly i take korean,btohqsg
Wat do u think literature exams are about,btohqsg
Simple rhymes in case they ask you to make a poem based on the text,btohqsg
They will never ask you to do that,btohqsg
Oh welllll then my school sucks,btohqsg
In JC  I spammed and analysed unseen poems,btohqsg
Yeah i admit idk much cuz im y1 and cuz no lit,btohqsg
And then give to teacher to mark during consult,btohqsg
Just listen to ur teacher’s advice,btohqsg
Cause lit is a teacher reliant subject where u need a lot of feedback on your thought process,btohqsg
yall know a place that can study outside,btohqsg
Not many places offer this service esp during covid,btohqsg
if you are in the East try Lifelong learning centre,btohqsg
huh covid they allow ah?? if can i wanna go leh. staying at home sucks,btohqsg
it is still open  I went there 2 weeks ago ish but I went there for 1h only. I am not sure if can stay longer,btohqsg
wth u can only stay for 1hr??,btohqsg
but should be can because the skills classes there are still going on,btohqsg
tbh that applies to all libraries,btohqsg
you can chill at the public spaces there  no need go the library,btohqsg
yk i honestly wonder  what happening to people taking pw during covid,btohqsg
i search but they not opening seats at library. only can borrow,btohqsg
mm yea thats true but damn hot seh wlau so sian,btohqsg
yea hahah i think im jst stuck at home lah,btohqsg
I used to camp there last year almost everyday 2-6pm,btohqsg
yea libraries especially the bugis and tampines hub were my go-to but now covid messing everyth up lmao,btohqsg
I never go tamp hub cause a lot of people. LLC public space not so crowded,btohqsg
is it possible to change your study environment to be more conducive? personally i just move my gaming pc away to another room  and it helps to concentrate,btohqsg
yea i like to move my distractions (e.g. phone  tv) out of my bedroom. smtms i also move my study table about lmao. just so i dont get bored with my place,btohqsg
u can also study in other places in yr house too! at least thats what i do,btohqsg
"yeah when i was overseas  i tried doing this strategy where i keep my room a ""happy"" place  so no studying there  I would go to a library or the common area to do work. that works too",btohqsg
"yea haha thats exactly what i do but covid now is not helping :""(",btohqsg
u could try making a study room or another study place if u have the space in yr home,btohqsg
hahah  i considered that but now my gaming pc is my PC so theres not much of a change anyways,btohqsg
oh shit yea thats hard. u got another comp or smth? haha,btohqsg
maybe u can use yr family members' computer to play games?,btohqsg
u just gotta make sure yr study space and all that is separated from your other stuff that u use to relax (gaming),btohqsg
a dorm kinda ya feel me?,btohqsg
ohh haha then idk man cos i live w my family,btohqsg
ig just try to work towards this lmao i rlly dunno. maybe put a block app on yr gaming stuff in yr pc?? u can schedule when u wna play and study,btohqsg
haha bro thanks for your concern ❤️ I dont really have much time to play anyways  but that is a great idea man,btohqsg
im a girl lmao but no problem man,btohqsg
I stay in a dorm as well,btohqsg
And the bed is killer so I camp in school until late to revise,btohqsg
You can try Jewel  there's a place my friend found and its called Coffee@works. They have a power outlet for you to use and won't chase you away.Another option is the hospital. It's open 24 hours and their coffee bean/Starbucks should be open as well.,btohqsg
But in view of this virus  are they still operating 24 hours?,btohqsg
No  they shut down at night,btohqsg
Nah  I went there at 1 am the day after POP to send my friend off,btohqsg
I work night shifts in a hospital and the coffee bean was open the entire night. Maybe it differs?,btohqsg
Hahahah I was talking about the airport/Jewel Starbucks,btohqsg
Hospitals are a good place to study  but they won't chase away anyone right?,btohqsg
Not sure tbhCan give it a try :D,btohqsg
hello everyone. Have anyone retake o level Chinese and Chinese B together at the same year before and what are the benefits for chinese B as a subject?,btohqsg
I think people generally don’t take both CL and CLB?,btohqsg
CLB’s main benefit is that you don’t have to take CL,btohqsg
I have a friend that did,btohqsg
The benefit of Chinese B is that in case you fail Chinese  your pass in CLB allows you to still go to JC. Assuming you have sufficient graded O level subjects  because CLB is not counted.,btohqsg
But if I want to go poly  can I count chinese B as one of my R4?,btohqsg
What is it and why is it 257.7 mb,btohqsg
