Posted on behalf ofThePhysicsPageHi all  exam season is approaching and many of you may be struggling with subjects like physics or math. 😩Regardless of whether you are preparing for A/O/N levels  If you have homework  content  or any other questions while preparing for your exams  head over to@ThePhysicsPage_on instagram.https://www.instagram.com/thephysicspage_/The reason I created this page is to provide free help to students struggling to understand physics concepts! I also wanted to post puzzles which I found interesting so that hopefully you will start to see the fun side to physics :D Most importantly  I wanted to help students who are struggling to have someone to discuss their doubts or confusion with! (something i learnt during my time studying: no question is too dumb to be asked)Just some background: I graduated last year and took H1 GP; 4H2s (PCME); and H3 Game Theory in JC. I scored As for the subjects I took and so if you have any education related questions (e.g.  how to study for certain subjects or wanting to find out more about the subject etc.) I will really hope to be able help you out! You can drop me a DM on instagram and I will get back to you 🙌🏻For students taking H2 physics  I have a free set of summary notes which I used while in JC that I can send to you to aid your revision! Just DM me your email on instagram and I will send it to you in a pdf format. 👍🏻 (those taking H1 physics are also welcomed to DM me. The only thing is that some parts of the notes may not be that relevant)Do also follow our new telegram channel to receive updates  study tips  and more!https://t.me/thephysicspage,btohqsg
Anyone got tips for coast GI for geo  my exam is tmr and it’s literally so hard to answer the qns…,btohqsg
can someone recc an aesthetic language pack 🥹 for android fjdndndjd,btohqsg
hihi!! anyone has good bio notes (preferably book) to reco?,btohqsg

Hey guys anyone receive tp Business rejection letter,btohqsg
Anyone know if still possible to get B3 or above for pure sci if practical component is boderline pass/ fail?,btohqsg
Heard my tcr say many people would get Cs,btohqsg
but still good to tru to do well for prac,btohqsg
kind of did badly for my prelim prac today  and missed out the last page,btohqsg
try for paper 2  will boost ur marks,btohqsg
I have students still scoring A2 despite claiming to do badly for their practicals. So it's still possible.But do bear in mind that I didn't get to see their practical answers  and bad is a relative comment.,btohqsg
ohh I see  for mine ik my graph scale is wrong because I couldn’t get the y intercept  and I also lost some marks at circuit and forgot to do the last page 😅😅,btohqsg
There was also an A level chem tutor who did A level chem without practical. It was SPA as continous assessment back then  and he decided to just skip it.And he still scored As each time just to show it's possible.,btohqsg
ensure u don't make same mistake for Os,btohqsg
haha i scored A2 for Os despite doing super badly for phys prac,btohqsg
graphs always watch out for 4 points only,btohqsg
i basically failed the prac quite bad,btohqsg
but ofc slightly triggered that didnt get A1.. phys was one of my strongest subjs,btohqsg
not surprised as Os has been getting quite easy  especially Physics,btohqsg
I will always remember it now,btohqsg
ohh my scale I was told to do like12 boxes -> 100 degrees1 box-> 100/12,btohqsg
I just went through with my students only 😂,btohqsg
how Abt a lvl physics  wats ur oppinion on its difficulty?,btohqsg
got so confused today I got like 7~~ then I jst round up to 10,btohqsg
I mean  the difficulty across the years,btohqsg
or out of subjects like physics  chem  math  do u think physics is the lowest jump from o to a lvls?,btohqsg
Database question was a step up in difficulty.,btohqsg
Apparently I heard h2 physics is now a shadow of it's former self from my psrents,btohqsg
in your time was there calc in it?,btohqsg
how Abt chem  has content gotten less?,btohqsg
I should flex a bit that I received the award for being among top 10 A level students back in 2001 for Physics 😂,btohqsg
I didn't take A lvl Chem,btohqsg
Wah they gave that award ah,btohqsg
few years ago yes  now not sure. They didn't update the website.I'm also quite peeved that my year 2001  names were not published there,btohqsg
only have cert and a medal,btohqsg
if in internal school exams since there is no bellcurve and all  is it still possible to get >65? coz practical alone is 20% alr 😭,btohqsg
rank 39. Can still find the website. I found recently 😂,btohqsg
only top 5 in SG went. I was rank around 8 or 9  can't remember.That year they chose top 5 to ipho and next 8 to apho,btohqsg
ahh I see  nvm  still top 10 is the strongest achievement,btohqsg
Quite sure ioi is like that also lol,btohqsg
I think now is top 8 go apho  top 5 of apho go ipho,btohqsg
not sure if ioi had 2 teams this year,btohqsg
Bedok why r u not as zai as them,btohqsg
It's ok yall a lot more zai than I was,btohqsg
I was doing quite bad 😔🙈,btohqsg
top 0.01% of singapore physics doing bad??,btohqsg
I forgot an important formula during the practical round,btohqsg
I sort of derived it based on experimental results but was still half wrong,btohqsg
@TanJunWeiis spho format also top 4 ban?,btohqsg
noi format is top 4 of each year ban  dunno Abt spho tho,btohqsg
then makes sense for top 5 ban,btohqsg
coached njc before in the past. Not easy,btohqsg
ya I am suffering in spho now,btohqsg
I was thinking hmm h2 didn't seem too fun  why not try spho?,btohqsg
it's an experience that will help u in your As,btohqsg
I took part just because I gave face to my teacher to go for selection,btohqsg
I was scoring Bs and Cs for A level Physics then,btohqsg
Spho has taught me 1 THING: Everything is differential equationsEverything is deltaEverything is limitsEverything is epsilon,btohqsg
Spho was a nightmare for me,btohqsg
lol hi took part last year,btohqsg
I didn't win anything for spho as I didn't really study for it,btohqsg
dats a lie  if not won't even go apho,btohqsg
but somehow got selected to represent sgmaybe because the better ones gave up and chose other sciences,btohqsg
honestly the qns are not that hard,btohqsg
I honestly don't rmb a whole a lot about my Spho other than not having a good time,btohqsg
but if u dk the formulas,btohqsg
but mostly due to my way of prepping,btohqsg
there were those who went for phy chem and bio olympiad all 3,btohqsg
but everything first principal not very fun ah,btohqsg
Last time there was triple science combi,btohqsg
cram h2 and h3 phys content all in 1 year,btohqsg
I did math chem and physics,btohqsg
In J1  I really didn't care,btohqsg
ya bro wtf it's legit all cramming,btohqsg
cuz I didn't do as well for Os,btohqsg
I basically coasted all the way till A levels,btohqsg
went into my jc because of appeal using cca,btohqsg
Got into uni through luck and miracle,btohqsg
13 pointer in RI is among the worst scores,btohqsg
I took a single humanities and scored C6 😂,btohqsg
clearly 13 points meant jack by the top 10 in physics a lvl,btohqsg
English and Higher Chinese both B3,btohqsg
woke up my idea after I got selected to represent sg,btohqsg
that's when I started being more serious,btohqsg
bringing back good ol memories :'),btohqsg
that was like 1999 for me 🙈,btohqsg
You got to the point where you can,btohqsg
2 teams in 2020 and 2021 cos sg was host,btohqsg
actually ioi sel is both noi and apio,btohqsg
they changed back to top 5 go ipho  next 8 go apho,btohqsg
https://ranking.ioi2022.id/only 4 ppl perfect score and all from china :/,btohqsg
no top 4 ban only for noi lol,btohqsg
phys chem math bio olym dun have ban,btohqsg
yah but the thing is like for other olyms is rly very difficult to do very well before u get to jc,btohqsg
for sciences theres a ton of content,btohqsg
for math there r ppl dominating from younger ig  but its not as much as io,btohqsg

as a person who is currently serving.... trust me ydw to enlist at all,btohqsg
Depends on the unit you ‘re in.,btohqsg
Cuz doctors is always in high demand in SAF. Besides   can pay them $1K+ per month cuz NS. So they get doctors at a ‘steal’ rate.,btohqsg
also it only applies to local med sku iirc,btohqsg

What’s the possibility/probability of getting B3 overall if oral is a merit?,btohqsg
Cos my teacher said B3 quite low but B4 is high,btohqsg
The benchmark for Merit to be B4 & 3 (Some actually can get A2 even),btohqsg
You are likely to get B3/A2 for Merit at the second sitting,btohqsg
Since the first sitting is always tougher  you are likely to get B3/B4 instead,btohqsg
It is possible to jump up to 2 grades higher for the second sitting!,btohqsg
If you can get B3/4 with Merit  that is considered good enough!,btohqsg
in summary  finished NS and reservist,btohqsg
means u nvr keng hard enuf,btohqsg
is it possible to get A1 for chi if my oral is merit?,btohqsg
Eh wait there's legit some schs,btohqsg

hello guys  shd I drop pure physics if I find a lot of difficulty in it? did my prelim paper 2 today  every topic I didn’t understand( dc circuits emi) all came out  mind kinda blanked out and I’m honestly predicting like 10+ marksthose I studied( static  density eg) all didnt come out,btohqsg
feel so bad tbh  i understand the content and all but when it comes to application i can’t do it,btohqsg
dont drop  still have time to improve  but u might need a private tutor to explain to u concepts since the situation seen quite bad,btohqsg
i joined a group tuition w one of my classmate recentlyshe felt that the paper was ez while I felt rlly shit:(,btohqsg
tutor and sch tcr gonna be disappointed af,btohqsg
literally as I sat there during my exam I was alr thinking of dropping this subj :’),btohqsg
for prelims i also dk what was going on  got a C6  but then had private tutor to reteach almost the whole syllabus again  end up got A2 for o's.....it can be done,btohqsg
I can never get C6 :’)always getting D7-F9 what should I do?,btohqsg
I was triple science student and I dropped physics after prelims. If you don’t need it for A levels just drop it …,btohqsg
I take pure chem and pure phys onlyI also take pure geog and elect histTbh if I rlly drop a subj  I don’t know if I shd drop physics or geog( my hist isn’t that gd so I guess having 2 humans will still be safer),btohqsg
rilly depends on u want go jc or poly,btohqsg
If you’re doing worse in physics then that is the subject you should drop… was doing 9 subjects then so dropping one was ok for me,btohqsg
Hiash I think my prelims gonna be all D7-F9s,btohqsg
Your physics grade will show on your results slip too… but if you really cannot study the subject no point doing it… I came to that conclusion after my prelims,btohqsg
Is having two sciences compulsory for jc? What if I only have one left( chem)?,btohqsg
try not to drop anything  just persevere and try to do ur best for olevels,btohqsg
i alr dropped hcl start of this yr hahah,btohqsg
If you’re aiming for science stream… then I guess it matters later on… you need to look at your points… but it was a relief when I dropped it… don’t feel pressured to do it.. everyone is different,btohqsg
i think the sch will advice u to drop to combined science instead of just having one pure,btohqsg
But means cock block sci stream if drop right,btohqsg
Wait what requirements for bio ah,btohqsg
there’s some hybrid combi too right?,btohqsg
which jcs have tho? anyway to find out?,btohqsg
if I get like 20%+ for my phy prelim I shd just drop right?,btohqsg
like i wanted to drop phy and a math  but now i look back  i realised it was a good thing i didnt,btohqsg
Idk ah cuz my sch officially ban dropping esp now but,btohqsg
same now no longer able to drop,btohqsg
