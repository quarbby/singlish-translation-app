For item 1  all existing application will be voided. Could  receive any email from HDB to say that ongoing application has been voided?,btohqsg
From my experience of selecting May 2022 and giving up Aug 2022 application (meaning it would be considered cancelled) I didn't get any email from HDB. On the flat dashboard  the Aug 2022 one status showed cancelled or sth like that.Idk if things have changed since then  so someone else could share if they have recent experience,btohqsg
New rules apply for October 2023For this,btohqsg
Cannot kick unless divorce. I bought a resale under single scheme b4 married. Then hdb checked rom records and by default put my husband as the occupier.,btohqsg
Existing application meaning need reapply for hfe?,btohqsg
Btw when sales launch  will we be able to see the facing direction and floor plan design?,btohqsg
Legally cannot kick? Legally the house is owned by the owner and not the essential occupier.,btohqsg
Parents  sibilings  etc can remove easily as the idea is they can get their own place. But husband and wife considered a compulsory family necleus so cannot anyhow remove,btohqsg
Hi guys can I just ask why for HFE occupier also need to submit payslip ? Cause they won‚Äôt be servicing the loan anyway,btohqsg
My neighbour (other floor)  she own her unit from resale market  and her partner (currently so called 'husband') also own a unit (on the same floor just 3units away) from resale market. They were then became lover. The old units were then enbloc so each selected a 3room unit at SkyResidence.  But before TOP & collection of keys  the women got pregnant & saw her with her new born..  I assume they are then legally married.Hmm not sure hdb is doing a background check on each applicant?,btohqsg
Wa how u know they become lover ?And how u know enbloc all this details,btohqsg
The woman got pregnant and if is married also can be sole owner of an hdb with the Singaporean child,btohqsg
its her ‚Äúneighbour‚Äù pls  shes concerned she will kena trouble ü•π,btohqsg
They got a house each in legitimate way. Nothing wrong  SERS HDB doesn‚Äôt mean they would make alot of money because they bought on resale market and it‚Äôs also price on the remainder value of the house. But they got a new house which is awesome.No one say 2 single neighbours can‚Äôt fall in love with each other leh üòÇ,btohqsg
If they get married have to sell 1 unit.. hdb check rom records periodically,btohqsg
I know because they found out i got married,btohqsg
Let me check with my neighbour üòÄ,btohqsg
No  if they are legally married  then if hdb found out sure ask either one to give up the bto unit. Worst is  if they didn't report to hdb.,btohqsg
Ah so hdb check rom records too.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs to check? What do you want?,btohqsg
I think this is a personal question & also their choice whether to be married or not. If legally married in Singapore  one must give up on it.But  you won't know if they marry overseas but don't declare in Singapore. But this trend of being single but having partners and owing houses is on the rise in Singapore.,btohqsg
Too many such cases already in fact some purposely divorce to have 2 properties..I guess as a matter of fact  its something quite hard for HDB to control or handle.,btohqsg
Normal. Just like cases couple that dont want to divorce in order to keep their hdb that havent reach mop.  But have live separately. Only after mop they divorce. Life is hard for some.,btohqsg
But i can assure u if they were married in sg  hdb would be the first one to know,btohqsg
Singpass wont lie. All our data is there,btohqsg
Yup..this I agree..Also another reason why those divorced rather stay single then get married in Sg..if not they will have to lose their HDB,btohqsg
Thanks all for the valuable opinions of the story I shared earlier. Hmmm  not being kaypoh  as she was the one who seek advise. I will relay to her of the opinions gathered for her own judgement.,btohqsg
Simple. HDB can do the checking. Afterall  HDB is govt agency and if you caught lying or whatever well jeng jeng jeng la,btohqsg
Afterall  let the authority do the job üòä,btohqsg
