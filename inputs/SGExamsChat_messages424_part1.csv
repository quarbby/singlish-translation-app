Is it weird to sit for olevel at the age of 18.,btohqsg
well the usual age is 16/17,btohqsg
not like many people can tell a 16 and 18 y/o apart,btohqsg
Go at ur own pace king,btohqsg
Nah I had like 2 facial hair in my chin,btohqsg
So I think it would grow more,btohqsg
Well yes but actually who cares,btohqsg
U get the cert that's what matters imo,btohqsg
Its supposed to be No right,btohqsg
"lol i didn't even click the chat but i saw last message being ""maybe our snorlax knows""",btohqsg
I know some people that did that. nothing wrong,btohqsg
Uhh that is some bad phrasing,btohqsg
This one is the ns medical checkups shit,btohqsg
Basically just now I bought second hand generation AirPods from this guy,btohqsg
I think heâ€™s young thatâ€™s why,btohqsg
I said before if spoiled can give refund,btohqsg
But now he said he spent the money,btohqsg
And the AirPods was spoiled lmao,btohqsg
And he said can only pay $20 instead of $30 refund,btohqsg
Should I lodge a police report or something,btohqsg
Lol why does he sound like selling his parents stuff without permission,btohqsg
Like I also need the money to buy another earpiece,btohqsg
Well u can try lodge police report but dunno if anyth will come out of it one,btohqsg
He gave freaking spoiled AirPods wtf,btohqsg
How do I lodge a police report,btohqsg
This isn't a shop selling stuff,btohqsg
Like wtf gave spoiled AirPods eh,btohqsg
it's quite a small amt also,btohqsg
But doubt much will come out of it,btohqsg
I mean heâ€™s definitely a kid if he canâ€™t afford to pay you back $30,btohqsg
This is why don't buy tech from carou ig,btohqsg
Feel like the AirPods not even his in the first place thatâ€™s why dk if spoiled,btohqsg
He said it was his friend,btohqsg
Aiya it's basically a scam atp,btohqsg
And he said his friend say ok,btohqsg
Young kids always got similar issues liddat,btohqsg
I mean the AirPods play for 5 seconds then disconnect automatically wtf,btohqsg
He said it was his brother then friend wtf,btohqsg
I mean if you want to be mean  you could be more assertive with demanding money back.,btohqsg
cos idk whether police will do shit for this,btohqsg
I think just get the $20 refund back uh   save the trouble of lodging report and all,btohqsg
But $10 is a lot ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
yea thatâ€™s why try to be assertive with it,btohqsg
Uh I finish Os already so I got a lot of free time I guess,btohqsg
If he really desperate he will ask parents or smth,btohqsg
If he so young really need fast cash,btohqsg
Lmao I got no more money sia to spend $200 again,btohqsg
Yea and it wasnâ€™t even clean,btohqsg
He didnâ€™t even clean it sia,btohqsg
wouldnâ€™t be surprised if he sell just to buy some game or trading cards,btohqsg
