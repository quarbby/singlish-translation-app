You had a reply though. Anything that you are not hAppy with answer?,btohqsg
Use visa meaning Citi rewards visa? But instream only accepts master?,btohqsg
You missed the context. They are comparing amaze linked cc against UOB visa and assumed visa and Mastercard used the same exchange rate. In fact  they don't.,btohqsg
Ok I‚Äôve questions  Grab PayLater  my wife is using that to earn extra points  as much as I do not want to affect her earning points  Which CC is better ah? So can earn miles n grab point at the same time.And 2nd question  going for alterations and I see MCC 5697 is part of it. Standard chartered journey  visa CC  will only earn 1.2mpd right?,btohqsg
Maybe your employer  mis calculated your AW contribution. Because there was the ceiling change in sept 2023. The refund is for 2023 contributions (not 2024).You probably got your AW before Sept 2023.,btohqsg
Hmm I saw the 2023 and thought it was CPF typo,btohqsg
If you are at the 37% rate  n you hit OW & AW cap  I think your refund will be $444.,btohqsg
Possibility but unlikely.  But strange it took so long for them to take care of this.That‚Äôs the year where the salary ceiling got changed midway in the year & would have affected those who had AWcontributions based on $30 000 ($102 000 - $72 000) but AW should be reduced by $1 200 as OW increased by that amount in Sept.,btohqsg
There's only UOB Absolute Cashback card for Grab top-ups. And yes PayLater is considered top-up.,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I apply for the dbs yuu supplementary card for my wife to use. Should she be logging in my yuu account or her yuu account in her phone?,btohqsg
you need to plan around your mortgage payment also mah. if you using cpf to pay mortgage and intend to retire early means your oa contribution will stop early  then where will your payment be from if you invest your oa? will have to use cash to pay which reduces cashflow,btohqsg
if you think you can retire early  i assume you are on the higher than average income side. if i were you  i will leave oa for mortgage payments and use cash to invest where its more accessible to drawdown from,btohqsg
Hi gurus are we able to check if a citi premiermiles expense MCC we did is covered under the 1.2MPD and not in MCC exclusion?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt seem to find their T&C that states the exclusions  other than this which looks incorrecthttps://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/travel/premiermiles-card/pdf/citi-premiermiles-card-members-agreement.pdf,btohqsg
Have you all use amaze card with citi rewards CC to purchase FairPrice physical goods ?,btohqsg
for uob stash  if not stacking with uob one card for the spend max is 3% for first $100k?,btohqsg
Okie I have $500 to spend there then üòÇ. Cause I sign up with HeyMax Ai. I‚Äôve existing Citi cash back +. So I‚Äôm checking ifheymax.aicould give me miles since is not stackable with the Promotions.,btohqsg
UOB Stash account have no such spend criteria and have 3% EIR at 100k. Only need to maintain MAB.,btohqsg
ah I see  guess I got confused with both mechanics,btohqsg
Have you already charged the transaction to your card? If yes  can ask citi cso via chat to check for you.,btohqsg
This is only via web not app right?,btohqsg
The app has chat function too,btohqsg
Hi all- if I plan to transfer my OA to SA. Is it best to do it on Feb 1st or 31st Jan? To max out the interest,btohqsg
Sorry.. do you might to clarify why is it on 31jan ? I would like to understand the reason behind,btohqsg
actually i would have thought no difference..since interest on CPF is paid on the LOWEST balance of the month.I would have thought in the month of transfer  the amount transferred would not get any interest in both OA and SA.why not transfer now?,btohqsg
so you would want to do it asap to get 4% vs 2.5% mah,btohqsg
so why not transfer NOW?ok sorry i didn't read properly.. OP only gave 2 choices... 31st Jan or 1st Febmy suggestion is transfer NOW.. haha..,btohqsg
Hi  for booking of hotel in foreign currency. Can i ask is it better value to use revolut/youtrip or to use trust cashback card?,btohqsg
trust cashback better since there is 1% cashback,btohqsg
and Trust rates are equal/better than YouTrip in lots of cases,btohqsg
visa rates  equal or very slightly worse than youtrip.,btohqsg
I have had experiences that have led to me writing what I have written. multiple currencies. I am not gonna talk about how you need to load Youtrip vs Trust is a credit card etc.,btohqsg
btw if you are comparing Youtrip wallet to Trust  maybe Youtrip has consistently better rates. I cannot comment on that,btohqsg
Oh im not sure  just i have been using revolut/youtrip because the fx rate has been decent traditionally.. didnt really keep up the comparisons with other cards,btohqsg
either way  I am sure it is not a lot of difference. so use whatever you have handy :D,btohqsg
Hi gurus  this kind of Fraser gift card promo can buy? Will have cc rewards or not?,btohqsg
isn't fraser 5965? UOB excludes liao.. be careful...,btohqsg
Thing is  Frasers gift card via app MCC initially is 6513  then final posted become 5965üòÇ,btohqsg
in fact i have reason to believe UOB included this weird 5965 exclusion entirely because of Fraser churning.. but that is purely my unsubstantiated guess,btohqsg
Always is 5965  did u not get reward for that? Last time i use uob one can get. Not sure abt now,btohqsg
UOB added 5965 exclusion from October 2024 only along with Amaze nerf..that's why we said got minefield.. since 5965 can pop up unexpectedly.. especially japan online bookings,btohqsg
I see then i use other card haha. Thank for the info,btohqsg
Of cos I want to get the 4% asap so best is to do it now? Then I‚Äôll lost the interest for both OA &SA in Jan?,btohqsg
no matter when you do  you will lose interest for the month cos interest is based on the lowest amount of the month. do asap is no wrong,btohqsg
Hi guys  I‚Äôd like to seek your advice regarding trading or investing in cryptocurrency as a beginner in Singapore. Could you guys recommend reliable and beginner-friendly platforms to trade or invest in crypto? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi  I'm collecting my BTO keys in around 3.5years++Also  according to my research  people are saying to invest it in Amundi Prime USA fund.Is it advisable to invest my CPF OA on Endowus / Poems before collecting key?,btohqsg
There is no advisable or not as that is financial advice. However  it is up to your risk appetite,btohqsg
Does anyone know what is the mcc for lifescan at novena?,btohqsg
Tried searching it via heymax but it doesnt come up,btohqsg
Only use MAS approved platform is what I do  for a start. The rest you really have to do your home work,btohqsg
Coinhako/moomoo for a start cause it is user friendly and eliminates alot of memecoins and alts so that you dont jump the gun and go straight to gambling.Once you get the hang of it gemini/coinbase/ kraken are some of the popular ones. Pls DYOR and DD before entering the crypto world. Not everyone can stomach its volatility.,btohqsg
I just learnt from the standard chartered bank hotline that the bank is not waiving their credit card annual fees for this year.,btohqsg
Use cash to invest In what?,btohqsg
This is investment advice which nobody is allowed by law to give you here.Talk to a licence professional for ideas but try to execute them yourself for lower fees.,btohqsg
Yes this is something which I have been warning about.But I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs impossible to waive annual fees. Just take note scb isn‚Äôt like last time anymore where annual fees can be waived most of the time. Now it‚Äôs like some of the time. Need justification and ‚Äúfighting‚Äù. May not succeed.,btohqsg
How is Instarem different from YouTrip?,btohqsg
one cat one dog... totally different.,btohqsg
Youtrip = debit card giving you good FX ratesInstarem = remittance platformAmaze (under Instarem) = Debit card that lets you link to Credit Mastercards,btohqsg
Just to add on Amaze Wallet = Debit card giving you good FX rates üòÇ,btohqsg

it is very clear.. if you registerMr Rich... Mr Rich Single and Mr Rich / Mrs Rich joint accountboth gets registered into January 2025 promo.. both with benchmark December 2024.,btohqsg
Means next month still got chance in February.After this BTL.Then GG liao...,btohqsg
But does it matter which month you registered? As long as you are registered?,btohqsg
The month you registered will determine the benchmark month loh.. which for BTL isDecemberOctober 2024.So whichever account held the Cash inDecemberOctober 2024  cannot hold the cash also in January 2025.,btohqsg
sorry you are right.. yes October. i will amend,btohqsg

That is strange  I don't use cimb  but crmc is also ok with changipay,btohqsg
thanks for the warning... surprised that linked card will also kennathere is a small chance for wallet TOPUPs to attract cash advance fee but never heard before linked card spending also can kenna,btohqsg
maybe it affect cimb sg cards only. for now i earn changi pay to earn points and pay using physical card,btohqsg
Hi which card is the best to link with alipay/WeChat?,btohqsg
Alternatively  TRUST cashback if you are not into miles,btohqsg
Anyone experienced Shopee not being coded as 5699 for UOB Lady fashion category before? Did I do something wrong in the checkout process?,btohqsg
Shopee is not fashion category. You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong,btohqsg
What did you purchase? They asked u.,btohqsg
How will the item affect the MCC? Because you can have many items in same transaction right?,btohqsg
For Shopee  best to use OCBC rewards or UOB PPV,btohqsg
So lazada  taobao etc are 5311 fashion but shopee is not? Did I understand this correctly,btohqsg
Shopee was never 5311 to start with,btohqsg
You can use OCBC rewards. They whitelist Shopee so can earn the bonus miles,btohqsg
Even lazada can give varied mcc,btohqsg
Sometimes Shopee will code the transaction differently based on what you bought. Some got 5699  some got 5331  some got others also. Never wise to use strict whitelist based card on such merchants.,btohqsg
Shopee my favourite is dbs wwmc  ocbc reward  citi reward  uob ppv for miles and uob one for cashback,btohqsg
Recently i encountered a Taobao MCC 5399.,btohqsg
May i know anyone use ocbc frank card and pay bill via ipaymy  is it considered legitimate transaction to earn cash back?,btohqsg
ok so UOB lady is not safe to use for fashion. Which category is recommended?,btohqsg
UOB lady's is safe for Fashion  but not safe for Taobao. Just use a card that offers bonus for online would be safer.,btohqsg
Can check card t&c to see if it's in exclusion.,btohqsg
okay  so only safe for platforms that only sell clothes?,btohqsg
not safe for general online shopping platforms?,btohqsg
It is not exclusion but ipaymy customer service also cannot confirm and ask me use mile card because of point guarantee,btohqsg
shopee.. best is UOB One 10% cashback...,btohqsg
Alipay is setup for China residents to pay in Singapore,btohqsg
You can try.. usually safe if t&c does not state excluded.,btohqsg
So what did u buy? üò¨,btohqsg
Hi all gurus   is buying ntuc voucher online (ntuc app) eligible for citi bank smrt 5% rebate ?,btohqsg
You need to understand how they give the bonus. UOB lady‚Äôs is by mcc. Unless you are sure of mcc  if not  use blacklist cards,btohqsg
Sorry what's the benefits of using changipay? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi ChrisI have been a silent supporter for YouTube,btohqsg
If I transfer $ from my OA to my partner SA account to allow her to hit FRS faster,btohqsg
UOB krisflyer also can right? Especially the BNPL (pay later) MCC 5999,btohqsg
1) will both of us have supercharged interest?,btohqsg
If both of y'all have hit FRS on SA and BHS on MA  your interest and contributions to MA will go to OA.,btohqsg
Hi hi  any idea on investment options with optimal return and low risk please? Thanks üôè,btohqsg
There is no such thing as low risk investment. Even those recommended by insurance FA can lose capital value,btohqsg
actually it is exactly those that insurance agents recommend can lose capital value...they typically get fat commissions on those funds with higher management fees which are typically the higher risk ones,btohqsg
Anyone have any idea for boc family card  does deliveroo clock as online or dining? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Guys question on cpf investmentWith 100K in my OA   i can invest 80K max on a single premium ILP right ?,btohqsg
Ok for UOB KF but why 3mpd when you can earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi all  using UOB ONE credit card on klook transactions eligible for the min $500 spend for the cc cashback? I checked heymax website it is one of the recommended cards but i just want to double confirm. Thanks,btohqsg
True  probably I need to go and see if the two cards can accept 5999 ü§î,btohqsg
UOB is quite strict about buy now pay later service so I wouldn't risk it.,btohqsg
I've never had shopee coded as 5699. Usually  5262 for Visa  5331 for Mastercard,btohqsg
why would you do that? ilp is so bad,btohqsg
It has zero sales charge if its from cpf and management fee only at 1.6% mah,btohqsg
better than leaving it in cpf earn 2.5%,btohqsg
Is the ILP capital protected? I don‚Äôt think so. Why don‚Äôt you learn to manage yourself instead letting others do it?,btohqsg
I've only seen endowment plans that are capital protected  ilp likely not,btohqsg
its not but i rather take some risk to earn potential 10x more than leaving it in my OA account? It's my parents btw üò¨Worth?,btohqsg
Hi all expert card holders  do you have any recommendation card which best match spending on the list below:TravelDinnershopping(online and retail)TransportAnd qualified to earn rewards from contactless and online payment type.,btohqsg
ILPs are almost never worth it unless you're incompetent  search up Philips POEMS Amundi MSCI world fund  you can use CPFIS-OA to purchase at zero sales charge and low expense ratio,btohqsg
Then you must know that your iLP money can lose value if not managed properly. You can go through the chat history to know such examples. My iLP with prudential lose 40%,btohqsg
im not sure if ILPs are really that bad because here is my ILP 2.5 years in. Maybe pru you lost because of the fund you chose and their high fees of 3.3% ?,btohqsg
Most importantly are your parents OK to lose everything? Past two years the market has been performing well in my noob opinion.,btohqsg
My goal is to help increase their retirement money. And what better way than to invest it rightI believe they prefer to let someone handle their investments than to do it themselves because they dont have any investment knowledgeShort term lock ins for then as well for this ILP   can be withdrawn anytime without charges,btohqsg
My ilp break even I guess for the past 20 years if I take it positively. However even if I have placed it in a fixed deposit I guess I would have made at least 30% more?,btohqsg
Most importantly this is financial advice. No one can advise you legally.,btohqsg
Got good got bad ILPs la especially whether your agent honours his words for watching out for u,btohqsg
I have two prudential ILP the agent over the last 20 years switch in and switch out for me at the right time average every year grow 10%,btohqsg
Also had one AIA ILP that the agent mia after getting comm then 20 years in negative but because capital guaranteed so i only lost opportunity cost,btohqsg
Two years ago bought one n now the growth is 40% overall,btohqsg
Any way to go around this?,btohqsg
You can‚Äôt top up SA if it hits FRS. Wait until 55 then you can top up RA to hit ERS,btohqsg
Top up to your MA or love ones SA (income must be below certain low threshold) are the only options left...,btohqsg
Heard the prestige floor is 114k. Vantage not sure but if it appears in app high chance of approval.Can always try and report dp here. Can also apply Amex plat charge if that works for you. The income requirement should be lower,btohqsg
Ooo ok let see if it appears on my app üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes thru my safra DBS CC. Recent updated dec 2024  not sure if that‚Äôs counted. But they increase my CC limit,btohqsg
Ok they already did limit increase  nothing much you can do in this case,btohqsg
Btw I realized CardUp charge 3.4$ if the charging amount is less than 130$. 500 points gained.Then Citi pay all is at 1.30$ fee. But 50 points gained.Tired sia to count. But cardup mor ex . But the points might be actually worth it if taking the 1.3$ fee to 10 times that‚Äôs 13$ for 500 points üòÇ,btohqsg
Ok I shall cry at one corner üòÇ,btohqsg
Oh yes I want to point out  if I do this for my air con servicing. Do usually people accept to wait 5 working days to receive the payment? üòÇ. My time without all this so is cash  card up is really new to me.,btohqsg
Congrats on hitting your FRSSadly no way around it. I guess it is a happy problem.If tax relief is your objective You can top your MA (max $8 000) subject to BHS limit of $75 500 for 2025You can top up your loved ones SA/RA/MA (max $8 000). Do check the criteria of your loved ones income.,btohqsg
Then need to wait for income to grow. Work on that first?But why are u going for the 120k cards? Haha,btohqsg
Usually if I know the vendor I prepay,btohqsg
Cause existing card holders can apply n get 40k miles,btohqsg
Hahaa then slowly I guess. If not Citi prestige with the FD optionNot sure whether vantage has that option,btohqsg
I suspect if one‚Äôs credit report has 120k credit limit. Might have a possibility to get one. I guess when I get there I update u all if is possible üòÇ.,btohqsg
120k credit limit for each bank means your income is 120k already.The limit jumps once u reach 120k,btohqsg
Oh .. no la not each bank üòÇ sum total of the CC I have,btohqsg

Yes!! That‚Äôs my goal üòÇ. But I guess I go with DBS altitude for the PP.  UOB pm is 4 free for individual. Nonsense..I heard pp registering is per email.,btohqsg
Pp registration is per account. All accounts can share 1 email.UOB prvi not bad. Ask ur partner/wife to register one for herself.,btohqsg

I've never opened a UOB account before. Would be the First time. Will transfer our from DBS,btohqsg
ok then can register for the CNY savings promo if u dun mind the funds being earmarked for about 5 months.

Weird question: the SCB $500 promo only requires holding 3 months in good standing right?Didn‚Äôt see the typical min 1 year hold period like the usual Singsaver or Moneysmart promos. But ofc  cashback only be credited by May 2025 so need to wait till then to spend again.Thanks once again!,btohqsg

Hi gurus!I‚Äôm trying to hit the $500 spending requirement on my UOB credit card for the UOB One Account. I only have the UOB Lady‚Äôs Card  which covers travel and dining categories. If it were groceries  I could at least buy vouchers to meet the $500. Does anyone have suggestions on how to hit $500 for travel and dining? I usually eat at hawker centers  so after XNAP shut down  I‚Äôve been struggling to meet the $500 dining requirement. Thanks!,btohqsg
If you have monthly recurring insurance to charge  charge it to lady.,btohqsg

Have u calculate cent per miles if u redeem,btohqsg
If ur miles are expiring and u not in time to utilize them  this is a good alternative to exhaust them,btohqsg
If you eat at kopitiam  you can pay with FairPrice app for 10% and can link to credit card. Combined with UOB one card and use for household expense as well. The good thing is you can use both cards to pool and try to hit the spending requirement,btohqsg

Hi Gurus With so much nerfing going on with HSBC Revolution‚Ä¶Is it still worth keeping this card? Thinking of cancelling cos I‚Äôm already not sure what category of purchase can earn me 4mpd,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre struggling to hit specific categories on uob lady‚Äôs  maybe you should consider general spending card such as uob1 which covers most general expense. Worse case  you can also prepay telco bills such as Starhub,btohqsg
As in the 3 miles? Cos I already fulfill the yearly 800sgd spend.That's why need to know if this card pay Healthhub can or not üòÖ,btohqsg

Hi all  if have 500k savings but dw funds  just in savings acc lolI‚Äôm thinking of 200k for OC360  (EIR 3.6%) then 150k in UOB1 (EIR 4%)  where yall suggest to put the next 150k?,btohqsg
Mistake. You are correct. Then use Citi reward directly to earn 10x points,btohqsg
200k for OCBC 360? That's about 3% p.a.Only put 100k.,btohqsg
Oh I used the OC calc it shows 3.6% leh,btohqsg
Yeah. Most of the interests comes from your first 100k. Lol,btohqsg
602.98 x 12 =7 235.76 / 200k = 3.617% no?,btohqsg
Interest only applies to first $100k,btohqsg
But 1st 100k =$394.90x12 which is 4.7%Then when I adjusted to 200k and tick the last 200k acct balance checkbox  it shows $602.98 that‚Äôs why bring my int down to 3.6% le,btohqsg
It's about 3.46% p.a. after calculating based on the actual number of days plus reset month.,btohqsg
So isit will have 1 more Grow Bonus category?,btohqsg
So still feasible hor? Then remaining I put chocfin ah for liquidity? Haha,btohqsg
Yea but cos I can‚Äôt find any btr sav acc so since uob1 is 150k for 4%  even if oc is 100k is 4++  I still gotta keep finding others then need more tracking I kenot haha so just put 200k in OC,btohqsg
HSBC EGA 360k-ish at 3.7% p.a. instead? Best with 2 humans. You have 500k  150k at UOB One account and 350k at HSBC EGA.,btohqsg

Chocolate Finance if 50k then no guaranteed 3.3% p.a. anymore lol. In fact may end up losing capital. Remember it is an investment not savings account.,btohqsg
Prev I saw my daily int during the 4.2% period kena negative sign lol but then now like don‚Äôt have.. yup saw the ‚Äútarget‚Äù word haha,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt understand how the card works  then perhaps it‚Äôs not for you and it‚Äôs not worth it. Just cancel and get another card that suits your spending.,btohqsg
split ocbc into first 100k 4.6%  next 100k 2.4%. you should only put in 200k if you can't find any better option than 2.4%,btohqsg

$100k in ocbc360  $150k in Uob one  $250k toggle between hsbc ega and cimb fastsaver or Maybank.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think they published the eligible funds,btohqsg
Why put so much in cash?,btohqsg
Not sure why dbs multiplier is so unloved or seldom mentioned here... Personally I'm using it to get 4% every mth for the past few years.,btohqsg
Used to be 150k uob one  100k ocbc 360  100k dbs multiplier  remaining rotate among EGA  esaver  cimb etc. As I've deployed a good portion of my warchest into equities last year  I'm now using dbs for my last pot of cash. It's fantastic cos it's not tiered... Meaning anything from the first dollar starts earning the max interest rate of 4%!,btohqsg
Mine 3%  thinking of adding another category eg insurance  not sure what insurance to buy and whether it is worth the effort,btohqsg
I'm now having mortgage  therefore I'm buying only 10c worth of shares monthly (with no commission using dbs treasures OET)  plus occassional paylah as payment for lunch. Before discovering this strategy  I used to buy money market funds and dbs cancer as insurance for 12mths to clock the categories. Comms for the fund was only like 50c for $100/mth  insurance premium was a few dollars iirc.,btohqsg
Endowus or Syfe for SRS investment,btohqsg
Can share how you get 4% from DBS?Btw  BOC 100K can get >4%.Add OCBC invest Cat can add 1.5% more.,btohqsg
Cpf sa is officially closed for those age 55 and above.,btohqsg
Sorry  should be 4.1%... Method as shared earlier.,btohqsg
How do you get 4% with dbs multiplier? Need salary crediting?,btohqsg
For those without home loan with DBS is a bit harder. Need to buy insurance to hit 4.1%. Unless there is an easy insurance to buy.,btohqsg
Hmmm but my salary crediting already with ocbc 360Can use paynow method?,btohqsg
You may want to search chat history. I did not have DBS multiplier account. I Closed it long time ago because can‚Äôt meet the 3 categories.,btohqsg

Hi all  sorry noob question but I'm trying to figure out how does the 3.25% FCY fee applies and how to calculate how much more am I paying.If I buy something for 1000 ringgit and It cost me SGD 303 if I'm using youtrip/trustcard assuming rate is 1 SGD to 3.3 Ringgit.Compared to using another card that has 3.25% fee is it just simply SGD 303 plus 3.25%?,btohqsg
For me  BOC is much easier than this DBS multiplier.,btohqsg
Boc salary credit can do via fast? üò¨,btohqsg
This has been shared many times in this chat group for DBS,btohqsg

You can check out Chris video here for the explanationhttps://youtu.be/idvauSmo4RE?si=nutZe5x9NmvE-9gd,btohqsg
FAST method from UOB/dbs via paynow code SALA?,btohqsg
I have my Salary creadting  but last time I used DBS transfer method (not fast) to crediting more Salary to hit $6000  it was working. Now BOC Salary creteria is $2000 only  so I am not sure it is working or not now.,btohqsg

For $360k alternating  with 2.8% + 1% =$360k x 2.8% / 12 = $840$360k x 1% / 12 = $300$50 fall below fee on 2nd HumanNet Gain = $1 090 per month = 3.63% p.a.If you are still ok with this (vs the closest competitor I feel is UOB One at 4%). Then accept it loh.,btohqsg

From when till when is your last quarter statement?,btohqsg
This is with statement date Nov.  And I scanned thru all statements  never received any cash rebate.  üò≠,btohqsg
It is stated very clearly that your statement quarter is Nov to Jan,btohqsg
Thus  also Aug to Oct.  This statement is nov  but I don't see any rebate.  All statements also don't have.  Maybe somewhere went wrong or I misunderstood. ?,btohqsg
Assuming Aug to Oct is not the first quarter month  have you spent $500 on ELIGIBLE transactions on each month (Aug  Sep and Oct)?,btohqsg
Oh yes  found 1 statement which has the rebate.  Seems lots of criteria to be fulfilled.  Many thks for the advice.  üëç,btohqsg
There's not a lot of criteria to fulfill. Just spend $500 on ELIGIBLE transactions in 3 CONSECUTIVE months based on your STATEMENT quarter.,btohqsg

Too late now. Its almost a year.,btohqsg
Ya I used the chat bot and looks like they can consider if it‚Äôs within 3 months. 6500 is more than 10k miles. Because points were deducted and I didn‚Äôt see any $ outstanding since I don‚Äôt use the card and missed that deduction unless you click on the card to see the transaction,btohqsg

Hi for those who RSTU via giro  how long does it take for the amt to be credited to your CPF SA?,btohqsg
Hi guysI need help here yesterday I made a payment for my Citi credit statement including any pending transaction reflect on the appE.g statement:620Pending transaction: 30After I paid all I expect my credit limit back but it shows extra ->99 <- ????I called Citi bank they said any transection that is not confirmed will not pose on the statement but it will still reflect on the app as pending isn't?,btohqsg
pending transaction will only be reflected on statement if posted (few days after transaction),btohqsg
when is ur statement date and payment due date? Why in a hurry to make payment and have credit limit back?,btohqsg
yes when I paid I also included the pending amount but how come Citi shows that I still own then money o.o,btohqsg
For the UOB Stash Account  the interest is credited monthly ? To earn the max interest of 5%  the requirement is incremental or maintain current balance. If I maintain the stash account balance of 100k  it will meet the 5% interest?,btohqsg
it normally generate on the 19 of every month  i normally paid the statement together with any pending transaction to start a new,btohqsg
When did you pay? It takes time for Citi side to register and update.,btohqsg
what u meant by -> 99 <- ????,btohqsg
Sorry please censor ur cc number,btohqsg
Only same bank transfer is immediate to increase back the cc limit  all other bank transfer to card will take time to reflect.,btohqsg
Ur payment is pending. It will update in 1-2 days,btohqsg
yes but y after I paid the statement together with the pending transaction they shows that I got an outstanding of 99üò¢ ??,btohqsg
the pending amount doesn't telly....I called the bank the lady seem to be pushing around T^T,btohqsg
To clock the $500 would be your target for ocbc. From the hmsg video you can see some tips. Just note that paying for none cashback or miles earning category will also be counted for the $500 spent hence it be helpful for your planning.,btohqsg
Right isn't it supposed to be credit limit back to 100% after (fast trsf) ? In the previous payment I did this with credit limit instantly returned to 100% after payment but not this time üò±plus the pending isn't match what is shows in my account üòï,btohqsg
i am new to this miles thing  may i know how long does citibank points convert to kris+ miles takes ?,btohqsg
Citibank to kris + should be immediate but value is bad.,btohqsg
Usually it‚Äôs not instant. interbank transfer for bill payments also take abt 2 days to clear. Anyway if u‚Äôr in urgent need for credit limit  can always call in to ask for temporary credit limit increase,btohqsg
value as in 1 point to 1 mile?,btohqsg
Same bank mean citibank acct to citibank card.,btohqsg
U can go see other fintuber video on converting kris + miles using citibank point,btohqsg
To OCBC 360 users  Can I check if just crediting my salary and not touching it  does it allow me to earn the ‚Äúsave‚Äù interest.,btohqsg
Need to be 500 mab more compare to late month balancr,btohqsg
For example I have 75k in the account now. My salary comes in at 3k and I do not touch it every month. Technically I ‚Äúsaved‚Äù $500 so my mab will keep increasing. So does it counts?,btohqsg
Unless ur salary come in first day bah. Mab is abit tough to track so ppl just manually add. Plus all the public holiday thingy etc,btohqsg
Next example I hit 100k in Jan. and 150k in June. The excess 50k would be useless so if I transfer the excess 50k out to other account  my mab will become very high right. So what‚Äôs the best move here haha,btohqsg
actually any day also can  assuming the salary credited around the same day each month,btohqsg
Pls visit UOB website to understand how the ‚Äú5%‚Äù is calculated for Stash.,btohqsg
The issue is that pay day can change due to ph or weekend etc haha. So safer to just manually put on first day,btohqsg

Lol u see melyvn example of last day. If it come midmonth he also need to have 500 increase mab which 3k divide by 15 wont be ah,btohqsg
Last day is fair. But 25-27 ish or earlier of the month is fine,btohqsg

Sorry for stupid question- when using kris+ to pay  what's the mcc code? Which card can get best cash back and miles now using kris+?,btohqsg
Hi all  I searched in the chat about pumping petrol in Malaysia and it seems like the best card for miles is amaze + CRMC  is this correct?I believe UOB PPV works too if the terminal accepts contactless Apple Pay? Also UOB Prvi could be a good backup with 3mpd for spend in Malaysia? Just checking if there‚Äôs any other miles card for petrol in Malaysia that I could have missed.,btohqsg
I got$100 credit from dbs altitude for Nov spent and reflected to my Dec statement  but they not use the credit to minus the credit card balance in Dec and Jan. anyone have the same experience?,btohqsg
hello  so my application got automatically rejected by their system. Called the bank and they advised me to increase my credit rating to AA before applying again  and they couldnt help me find a reason why it got rejected.,btohqsg
try other banks? like maybe GxS or trust or Maritry to raise score to get some rating,btohqsg
Go for cards in other banks to increase your credit rating first. DBS  OCBC and UOB would be the easiest.Then probably try again with Citibank next year when AY25 assessable income is ready.,btohqsg
I tried citi and amaze on Petronas station  always get rejected. Also if you use SG issued card  system will block you from pumping Ron 95Counter inside not willing to do petrol transaction.,btohqsg
Use Google or apple pay will work,btohqsg
Really? They are easier than Citi‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
Hi guys  I‚Äôm gonna purchase a big item from audio house. I have Citi Bank + amaze and Dbswwmc.If I use krisplus > Apple Pay > dbswwmc or AMAZE  can i confirm that for both   I will enjoy the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Why your credit score is GX? Perhaps you need to find out this first  instead of bank gives you the reason. Because it is abnormal.,btohqsg
i applied it as my first credit card  and when it got rejected i saw on cbs report that my credit score was GX,btohqsg
Are you a foreigner working in SG?,btohqsg
nope  singaporean  working for a year already,btohqsg
Which bank account do you have now?,btohqsg
The is nothing wrong with having a GX score.It just needs one bank to take a leap of faith to grant credit.Having said that CBS credit score isnot the onlycriteria banks use to evaluate risk. There are others.,btohqsg
Where do u credit ur salary? Can get a card there first.,btohqsg
ok i'll look into it  but i just switched my salary crediting to ocbcüòÖ,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 acct? Can get ocbc credit card first and clock 500$ spend too for higher interest.,btohqsg
Hi all  after I max out $1k for amaze + citi rewards  what is the next best CC combo for daily spend to accumulate miles?,btohqsg
Online or offline? Usually people will navigate towards stack of UOB cc,btohqsg
hmm ok  but do i have to wait another 3-6 months to apply again?not sure if it will badly affect credit scores if i apply for another bank after a rejection,btohqsg
Id suggest waiting before applying again for citi,btohqsg
Ocbc cuz u have salary w them,btohqsg
oki  but then need to wait for a few months?,btohqsg
With all due respect I don‚Äôt think anyone in this group can guarantee your next application can be approved or waiting not waiting helps unless the person is a risk policy person who knows all the rules n knows your full profile.So the best is for a trial n error.,btohqsg
What Citi told you is a hint hint already,btohqsg
Hi guys  I‚Äôm gonna purchase a big item from audio house. I have Citi Bank + amaze and Dbswwmc.If I use krisplus > Apple Pay > dbswwmc or AMAZE  can i confirm that for both   I will enjoy the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Can but dont exceed the cap 1.5k and 1k respectively,btohqsg
Hi! Which travel visa card to accumulate miles would be recommended for someone whose credit card expenditure is about $800++,btohqsg
depends what kind of things you spend on  if just looking for general spending  citirewards (with amaze) or uob PPV are 2 cards that come to mind,btohqsg
For me  Citi-rewards with amaze for general spending and UOB lady card for travel related expenses.,btohqsg

But usually uob lady card. U wouldn't spend all the time for travel am I right. If not travelling the card is useless right,btohqsg
I do short or long travels every 2-3 months. So this card will work for me.,btohqsg
Ohnice. I'm stuck with not having a card for travel. As I usually only have travel twice a year,btohqsg
I find UOB lady card a balance to meet all needs. There is no minimum spending requirement to unlock bonus. The 4 miles per dollar is quite easy to get,btohqsg
Wonder why they call it Lady Card haha,btohqsg
Sounds like only Female can use the card lol,btohqsg
It used to be exclusively for ladies,btohqsg
For this KrisFlyer UOB Visa  the second paragraph which states in order to get 3 miles per $1  meaning general spending with min $800 for SQ within the calendar year? If not  it will be only 1.2 miles per $1 right? Did i interpret correctly?,btohqsg
Strange why it‚Äôs not a multiple of 8,btohqsg
this is mastercard not visa card. need min 800 spend on SIA/scoot/krisshop in membership year to get bonus 1.8mpd for dining  food delivery  online shopping and travel and transport,btohqsg
U want topup $48 get $88?,btohqsg
Oh thanks. forgot to see the card photo got the MC logo,btohqsg
Wow nice  UOB One the card spending requirement can be used for Lady Card. Im swapping to that card liao. ÓÄë,btohqsg
Im using eight but not porting from m1.,btohqsg
With UOB one card for household expense and UOB lady for travel expense  you can better meet the $500 spending requirement to unlock UOB one saving account interest,btohqsg
Uob one is general card while Lady card miles earning is by category. If it is just Lady card  you only earn 4mpd from few specific mcc in one category.,btohqsg
