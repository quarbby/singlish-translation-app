But if you want to pivot to other areas that are higher pay,btohqsg
anyway besides the math stuff  probs good to revise your h2 physics stuff bc your sem 1 will have a physics mod iirc,btohqsg
I mean I saw the GES that CS median salary has dropped and engineering salary has increased,btohqsg
Yeah but that's cuz engi salary has always been depressed,btohqsg
Then it is believed that the engineering people pivoted into finance or swe,btohqsg
any quantitative degree can pivot into finance if you have the skills,btohqsg
I think Comp Engi also raised the GES too,btohqsg
I heard of physics people in the end do finance also,btohqsg
And I have a friend doing SWE as a physicist,btohqsg
Everyone can Humanities too lmao I had a few seniors now in analyst positions,btohqsg
depending on the role you apply for,btohqsg
I feel that your math + problem solving skills are the reason why you are hired in finance,btohqsg
Finance can earn big bucks isit,btohqsg
a lot of finance places look more for quantitative skills + coding ability,btohqsg
But heard can earn big bucks,btohqsg
i mean it's an option for me,btohqsg
Not like going thru 4y  then u try to pivotâ€¦but it is impt for u to know what u want by end of y2,btohqsg
My cs friend internship pay $5k / mthðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
you have time to figure these parts out but try to explore as you go along,btohqsg
U hit the prerequisite of being asian,btohqsg
And you have to figure out if it suits you or not,btohqsg
like when you're in undergrad  take time to try out other skills,btohqsg
Some people like that work culture,btohqsg
apply for internships see if you like it,btohqsg
I still tryna find some of the hall cats,btohqsg
Does that count as a skill Si Yan?,btohqsg
I had an engineering friend and he go to the IB route,btohqsg
lol i was in the cat management network,btohqsg
I only know ppl who study business mostly go to marketing,btohqsg
U in Grad club as well?,btohqsg
Everyoneâ€™s journey is unique  dun take someoneâ€™s path as a guide and be fixed on it,btohqsg
anyway the best advice i can give for career is try things out as much as possible,btohqsg
even if you hate it  you can cross smth out,btohqsg
Doesn't mean you are in engineering means stuck in engineering,btohqsg
But if u are thinking of pivoting away fr ur degree  think far ahead and try out internships first,btohqsg
So either way that's one thing I hope you can realise,btohqsg
And also it is not too late to switch course,btohqsg
there's compulsory internships but you can literally apply whenever you want,btohqsg
That's why I wanna try your mods. If I hate it at least got Si Yan to scold,btohqsg
Huh what field can earn money?,btohqsg
I mean under mom lawâ€¦ya u cant work for free,btohqsg
How much will i get paid,btohqsg
This one depends on the job,btohqsg
depends on company  field  your portfolio,btohqsg
Or which field are you talking about?,btohqsg
And there is no limit on number of internships,btohqsg
I usually will discourage people to become an insurance agent,btohqsg
Hmm ok thanks for explaining to me guys,btohqsg
i had no internships in uni until year 3 where i did 2 simultaneously,btohqsg
and my major then didn't even require me to,btohqsg
