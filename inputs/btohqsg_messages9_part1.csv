So when they apply  they declare got house or no house?,btohqsg
I don't know but they managed to pick an unit,btohqsg
some even wanted to look for MP if they get rejected by HDB,btohqsg
My bro did that. Got a rejection email after that,btohqsg
He went for SBF tho. Not sure if the rules apply,btohqsg
Np. I was under the inpression that we can do that as well. Since still under construction,btohqsg
But i think they wanna make it fair for people who really need one.,btohqsg
means those I have known who managed to snap an unit were lucky,btohqsg
Maybe their new internal policy. To calibrate for the increased demand,btohqsg
Hmm.. nvm. I just inform my friend to just try his luck. Worse come to worse find MP only,btohqsg
That is what most Singaporean will do,btohqsg
Later they will say  that‚Äôs the reason I voted for u!,btohqsg
later the MP asks  have you approached HDB? or vice versa,btohqsg
Of cos must go through HDB first ma  reject that‚Äôs why come find you,btohqsg
Like that once u got your BTO key  u can start applying again. As based on present pandemic  most will take more than 5 yrs. So just nice reach MOP. Lol,btohqsg
Take keys plus fulfil the MOP means 10 years liao,btohqsg
By right lah. 5 yrs MOP and 5 yrs waiting games for flat been built,btohqsg
I don't think HDB will allow you from applying if MOP not mature yet bah.,btohqsg
Hi all inside this group waiting for BTO house at tampines to be built?,btohqsg

Recently (few months back) I wrote to HDB asking precisely this thing and they replied say definitely must wait till current flat MOP finish then can apply BTO. Regardless when that BTO expect to TOP.,btohqsg
If using HDB portal to apply  cant even click to apply ba...,btohqsg
Means they gotten a unit despite MOP not met,btohqsg
Amazing right  how on one hand 'officially' say cannot be done but in practice is otherwise.,btohqsg
Perhaps the applicant had some extenuating circumstances that allowed the application to go thru  who knew.,btohqsg
106 HDB resale flats sold for over S$1m in first half of 2021  over 4 times total in same period of 2020: SRX dataProperty analysts said that the demand for million-dollar flats was driven by well-to-do buyers who want better connectivity and more space to work from home. Such flats were also more affordable than private property.üèòhttps://tdy.sg/3hoR8D9@todayonlinesg,btohqsg

Hello!Does anyone know for this case:Partner 1 is full-time employed for >12 months with gross monthly income$X.Partner 2 recently gained full-time employment (~1 month at the time of flat selection) with gross monthly income$Y.Will EHG calculation be$X+$Yeven though partner 2 is only recently employed? I asking because usually HLE don't take into account the current month income  so I wonder if EHG will consider.,btohqsg
think they would get the average,btohqsg
HLE is based on 3 months consecutive employment while EHG needs 12 months continously employment,btohqsg
as long as below combined of $9k salary,btohqsg
Ehg should be based on income prior to flat application and not selection.,btohqsg
Ohhh nice üëç I wait for HDB confirm with me this info üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi   do we need to renew our hle every 6 months till we get the house key ?,btohqsg
No. Just ensure you have a valid hle at the point of key collection if u are going for hdb loan. You don't need to keep 'refreshing' it.,btohqsg
Do I jus need to renew b4 key collection,btohqsg
if the HLE is able to last till your collection date  no need to renew,btohqsg
Pls update once HDB have confirm on this,btohqsg
Are those transacted prices in HDB records with or without COV?,btohqsg
With cov. And the split to show u the extend of cov being paid... How much lesser than 20k  and how much being 20k and above...,btohqsg
Coz i been tracking some of the resales  for a year... it appears most have risen 60-80k,btohqsg
So if u look at the north east pie chart  of those who paid for  66%  paid 20k and less,btohqsg
So if those pricing not including COV it's really scary.,btohqsg
To be honest  these pie charts don't really show much. It will be more informative if there is data to show what percentage of transacted deals were with or without cov,btohqsg
North east is 66% paid 20k and _below_,btohqsg
if 66% paid 20k and above cooling measures very soon liao,btohqsg
