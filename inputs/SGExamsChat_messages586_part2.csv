the person can make money and I still lose,btohqsg
I’ve seen guys on there with like a 100k in debt lmaoo,btohqsg
Never said I’m gonna do that,btohqsg
bro this convo is going no where,btohqsg
I was just asking you guys if you knew anyone who did that,btohqsg
and i said yes there a plenty number of them,btohqsg
but they are treating it as a job,btohqsg
Guess it can be quite addictive  it’s essentially gambling,btohqsg
u should try paper trading first,btohqsg
losing and earning imaginary money first,btohqsg
Oh yeah that’s a good suggestion,btohqsg
I should find the news article on this guy who paper traded and won a lotthen proceed to use real money and end up losing his own  his parents money and into large debtsjust because he kenna financial crisis when he started with real money,btohqsg
did a downie here just say,btohqsg
U must know alot of us here are below 21,btohqsg
The sooner you start the better,btohqsg
no  later the head all think of $$ and retirement and not study,btohqsg
pick up enough knowledge  earn enough  you will reach the goals much faster,btohqsg
how many have the right mindset tho,btohqsg
put yourself in their shoes  at the age of 16 will u be thinking of buying your first stock,btohqsg
the thing is if you keep thinking of it  then you limit your future potential,btohqsg
it's not hard to pick up the understanding and applyit's much harder to gather the capital to do so,btohqsg
doesn't matter when your starting pool is low,btohqsg
someone with a higher starting capital will still easily earn more with less effort,btohqsg
the compounding aint much when u start working and getting paid monthly,btohqsg
so you are proposing to pick up knowledge...,btohqsg
how  pray  does one do that?,btohqsg
don't think about investing before you have your first 20k to 30k at the bare minimum,btohqsg
I would put it at 20k,btohqsg
last time one uncle advised me 50k. I heck care start at around 20k lol,btohqsg
this is a good point. settle all your debts  and set aside emergency funds first,btohqsg
this uncle is a blogger i super respect btw,btohqsg
start mid small  because u have enough to play around  yet if you lose  you can easily bounce back,btohqsg
must be enough to be pain if you lose  then you learn emotions,btohqsg
emotionless may unknowingly turn into recklesswhich isn't what you want,btohqsg
everything boils down to the numbers  which is the mathsso master your maths well.It's not so much about the maths techniques  but about the analytical skills you acquire,btohqsg
depends tbh  would say if u have spare money that u dont mind losing  try investing,btohqsg
the amount that u lose  take it as a tuition fee,btohqsg
then will go in with extra care,btohqsg
"I feel like ""don't mind losing"" is more for sales persons to sell those risky funds",btohqsg
every dollar is a soldier we deploy to earn,btohqsg
definitely will have losses. All who invest for long will sure confirm plus guarantee chop encounter losses,btohqsg
the idea is to turn the probabilities around to make wins > losses,btohqsg
I should do SGExams youtube investing channel  investing knowledge for students 🙊,btohqsg
First videodon't invest now  go study first,btohqsg
Exactly  this is why I don’t support trading / technical analysis kinda stuff. If you lose $50 out of $100  you’re left with $50 and you have to make a 200% return just to get back where you started,btohqsg
Looking at it as percentages really helps,btohqsg
technical analysis has its usage. It's about probability,btohqsg
u should watch this mit open lecture about financial basics,btohqsg
I mean it makes logical sense  it’s easier to ensure you have proper risk management than speculate a “good” return on investment,btohqsg
"search up ""1. Introduction  Financial Terms and Concepts"" skip to 45 min for him to give u an example for risk adversion",btohqsg
