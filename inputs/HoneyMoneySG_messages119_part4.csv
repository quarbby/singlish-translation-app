Does anyone know if gym membership is eligible to get cash back from HSBC Live+?,btohqsg
I emptied my UOB One Account on Sunday in anticipation of new July promo.Just read on UOB's Nation of Savers Promotion. It says new fund is measured against Jun's ave balance.  So  it means I will have to wait for 1 month before transferring my fund from another bank.Any advice for my $150K?,btohqsg
I just opened HSBC EGA and registered sms  plan to do the 5 txn. Is the EIR 4.6% for Jul and Aug month?,btohqsg
So what is your June MAB?,btohqsg
Zero  as hsbc acct open open this month,btohqsg
Am new to hsbc  plans to use hsbc giro for other card payment.,btohqsg
Should be 4.6% for Jul  3.6% for Aug,btohqsg
So mean 1 Sep can transfer out the fund ?.,btohqsg
Is there any cap for hsbc ega deposit?.,btohqsg
You going to top $150k on top of $75k? That will not make sense as balance above $150k will not earn any bonus interest.,btohqsg
I mean Jun mab was $75k.Now I am going to put in $150k,btohqsg
So total is 225k. ur 75k doesnt earn interest.,btohqsg
Actually i think OP took out 75k  now putting in 150k  so fresh fund only 75k.,btohqsg
i notice uob has the samsung galaxy s24 lucky draw as well. Would anyone know if we could register for both this lucky draw as well as the nations of savers promo please?,btohqsg
3.6% for Aug because you are not doing any increment correct?,btohqsg
Yes correct. The 1% for Everyday+ Rewards only for incremental balance compared to previous calendar month (in this case July),btohqsg
That's right. Unless I wait till end Jul then transfer $150k from another bank.,btohqsg
Doesnt matter as ur june MAB is 75k.,btohqsg
So technically to max out  if on 1 July you deposit fresh fund of 360K and did the 5 transactions  you can earn the extra bonus cash reward of $300 (capped) at the end of July.,btohqsg
Did it take a few days to open the account online?,btohqsg
Usually is instant unless you answer wrongly,btohqsg
I have Giro arrangement to pay my Standard Chartered credit card on 15 July. But for some reason  I have already paid my credit card bill full amount. Will there still be a giro deduction of statement amount on 15 July? Thanks!,btohqsg
To get the maximum interest which is $1.1k  you need to empty out the account on 1-Jun and then deposit 150k in Jul.  So now  the fresh fund counted is only $75k and you will get $300. If you think is fine. Anyway  you will also get the 4% interest in Aug when you maintain 150k for the whole of Jul and fulfill the criteria.,btohqsg
No. Giro only deducts remaining balance. It's 0 in ur case so no deduction.,btohqsg
If they receive the payment before giro is initiate then u wont have to pay again,btohqsg
For Amaze  can i pair it with ocbc mastercard?Any ocbc mastercard to recommemd?,btohqsg
So it is better to keep .you $150k  in another back earning interest as well. Wait till 1st Aug then transfer to UOB to earn the $1.1k after 5 months. And of course the usual 4% every month,btohqsg
My view is put back $75k so you can earn the 4% interest for the month of Jul plus the $300 bonus with the 150k. If you have spare cash  you can deposit in another bank account that can help to earn high interest.  That is why if you search in the chat  there are people who use UOB and OCBC 360 accounts together to rotate and earn interest. But that is provided you willing to spend time to do that.,btohqsg
hi all  i‚Äôm abit confused. for the EGA account the interest is 3.6% right? the extra 1% is for GIRO payments only? if i read the previous thread correctly‚Ä¶I did not participate in last month‚Äôs promo and have negligible amount in EGA last month. if i transfer fresh funds  i‚Äôll get 3.6%?,btohqsg
get 1% rebate for GIRO bill payment and eligible hsbc card spend and also get 1% interest for incremental monthly average balance wrt previous month if fulfilled 2k transfer in and 5 transactions,btohqsg
okay! understand. thanks for the explanation üôèüèº,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is 0.05%. 3.6% comes from bonus interest promo. 1% comes from Everyday+ rewards.,btohqsg
the Everyday+ rewards is the part i dont quite understand. üòÖ,btohqsg
I SMS a wrong EGA account number when I participated for bonus interest promotion in April 2024 ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAnybody has HSBC email address? Searched through their website but can't find email address. They only have online chat  but no CS around..,btohqsg
Not worth it for you to play the latest UOB Savings promo...Make sure your UOB One account is empty/minimum for the month of September  expecting a new promo (not guaranteed) in October referencing September's MAB.,btohqsg
Got the call  I enquired about that clause and CSO replied that withdrawing on 1 June will be fine  only MAB of June will matter.,btohqsg
They have a number to call,btohqsg
I think is 1800 472 2669,btohqsg
What about going for HSBC ega first.,btohqsg
i also think they won't enforce.. but i can think what i think..i cannot guarantee..the last thing i want is a few months later  people come back and blame me said i told them won't enforce.,btohqsg
I actually emptied my uob one account on 31st May but wasted interest for June haha and realised I can't open an ega account online today,btohqsg
I can only share what i am actually going to do:1. UOB Savings promo - I am going to use a human that had already had $1k since 1st May 2024. Although still had salary in May and June which I immediately transfer out on the same day it was credited. MAB for May and June is $10xx.2. HSBC EGA promo -JulyI ignored the new '30 days' clause. I am still going to do normally. Put up till $360k cash in Human A  will have ins/outs in the course of the month since I do make use of the cash for investments. This account will also have money in / out due to GIRO arrangements. If they going to exclude in/out cash due to the 30 days  I will suck it up. No choice.AugustMove to Human B,btohqsg
Or ocbc if you do not have one currently,btohqsg
my experience with their call center was not so pleasant.The CS seems like have very limited knowledge about their own product lolThat's why I prefer email or chat where I can have a written record.,btohqsg
Just wanna nag this point again:IT IS IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to keep a liquid savings account with no in/out for 1-2 months..Especially by nature of the product:1. UOB One - needs salary credit2. HSBC EGA - need $2k/15k in + 5 FAST OUT  and use for GIRO paymentsWhoever intends to enforce the 30 days in/out fresh funds rule strictly needs to be bonk on the head.,btohqsg
Want to ask about dbs women world card. If I have a 30 June transaction but only posted on 1 July. Does it count under June or July $1500 monthly cap,btohqsg
