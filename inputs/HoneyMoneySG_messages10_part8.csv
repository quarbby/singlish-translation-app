Hi guys  which is the best and lowest cos platform/ broker to use for buying QQQ/SPY etf ?,btohqsg
if you trade less than twice per month  use Syfe Trade for free trade,btohqsg
I dca into QQQM + IVV once per month  so it's the perfect choice for me😀,btohqsg
but if you trade more frequently  I guess Webull and uSMART are the better choices,btohqsg
Thanks Julia for fast reply. 👍 I have not try Syfe yet. Are our funds segregated and safe ya ?,btohqsg
depends on ur trading amount. and dont just look at the charges on surface  also consider the hidden cost like the 0.3% or more fx spread in most of those $0 commission brokers.,btohqsg
Hi. For Credit Stacking hack  I noticed that top up to Jipay via Grab would incur a 2.5% service charge. So this hack will not work anymore right?,btohqsg
👍 am comparing which is safe n low cost,btohqsg
Yes  pretty good replacement for UOB One since no need to fulfill many conditions  albeit lesser cashback,btohqsg
Miles: Citi rewards  DBS WWMC  HSBC Revolution all 4mpdPetrol: Citi Cashback 8%Cardup/ipaymy card loan: Maybank Platinum visa 3.33%,btohqsg
Not too sure about that already,btohqsg
I'm using Syfe trade  more for the auto buy order function,btohqsg

Which platform do you use for DIY trades ? Not auto trades,btohqsg
What's the referral perks for ibkr?,btohqsg

anyone else investing in i500 (swap s&p500 etf).  Zero witholding tax,btohqsg
Lower liquidity   but over long term  returb around 0.3% more than cspx,btohqsg
Thanks for reply. Would you say TD Ameritrade is equivalently good as IBKR ?,btohqsg
I’m using Syfe Trade to buy and hold QQQM and VOO… but at the back of my mind I’m always wondering if there’s some hidden cost I’m not noticing …,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know the MCC for atome second and third payment? Thinking if can use hsbc revolution to pay to earn 10x points,btohqsg
Somoene know how to trade signal in IQ option through tiker broker,btohqsg
Each shareholder on the company’s record as of August 17  2022  will get 2 additional shares of common stock for every one share held. The additional shares will be credited to the shareholder account after the close of trading on August 24  2022,btohqsg
What happen if someone buy Tesla share after 17 below 24 ?,btohqsg
You just Google Tesla stock split or Tesla 17 Aug. Literally any article talks about it,btohqsg
Cant comment as I haven't used TDA,btohqsg
what are the pros n cons for using IBKR ? pls point out. tks,btohqsg
The shares we buy from webull is it kept with cdp or webull?,btohqsg
Webull custodian. CDP is only for Singapore shares and by CDP-linked brokers,btohqsg
Bro eventually u reach FIRE and applying the SWR  is brokerage CDP link key criteria for u?,btohqsg
Unsure  still figuring out along the way. I've a CDP linked broker reaching out to me for business opportunities  I'm sure it will appeal to some people but not all,btohqsg
nice. appeal for people doing dividend income FIRE SGX,btohqsg
I’m exploring  the only turn off is the high fee for our local brokerage with CDP Linked  so still with IBKR. Just that dividend withdrawal for income in future will be a little troublesome,btohqsg
The most fee optimum for CDP Linked brokerage I heard so far is buy using POEM cash plus and sell using FSMone. But too troublesome. Don’t think after 50 I got the energy to manage.,btohqsg
Has anyone switch to amundi within endowus,btohqsg
abit don’t uds. So we should top up only $15000 at age 25 and let it compound to around $40000 (which is also the reserved fund) for SA shielding? The balance we can shield or something?,btohqsg
Will be talking about it in my next Endowus update,btohqsg
Firstly  age 30*. Secondly  $15K of RSTU SA at 30 is for max utilization of reserved funds 40k by age 55. Meaning VCMA to BHS + OA-SA transfer is a more preferred way of building SA if you want to do max shielding,btohqsg
Oh. Meaning VCMA and OA to SA bestRSTU is not worth it,btohqsg
Not that it's not worth it  but it is a tradeoff,btohqsg
it will not matter if you are not doing shielding at all,btohqsg
ok. But if I want do shielding  one of the optimum approach is >>VCMA BHSOA to SA FRStop up SRS max and invest example stocks or S&P 500OA invest example S&P 500Before 55 do SA shieldingBefore 55OA: invested amount project returns 10%  balance 2.5% (supercharged)SA: 4% (FRS)MA: 4% (BHS)SRS: invested amount project returns 10% (tax relief),btohqsg
I’m confused about the SA shielding. Is it really shielding?I mean if they take my SA first and I have money in OA  I can just transfer OA balance to SA. Isn’t it the same?,btohqsg
My 12 cycles if my DBS invest saver is up. Currently investing in Nikko AM Sti Etf. Any other recommended funds i ca  switch to? To enjoy the dbs multiplier interest rate,btohqsg
I believe after 55 you can’t transfer OA to SA anymore,btohqsg
Im sorry but what is CFA,btohqsg
This cashback bonus is different from dbs multiplier?,btohqsg
Looks like the rates are better than multiplier and dont need to have a high balance in account,btohqsg
Haha yup! Earn on your transactions  keep your balances elsewhere like SSB.,btohqsg
