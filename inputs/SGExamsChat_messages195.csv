and ya this makes me wonder all the time why i chose geog but nvm,btohqsg
Like let's say in Chinese paper 1  section B had three questions but all three you dk how to write,btohqsg
i think its btr to understand,btohqsg
u understand then u can absorb,btohqsg
ya kinda HAHAHAHAGAGA her teaching style doesnt fit me,btohqsg
geog doesnt fit me la yes,btohqsg
lit and hist dont either so,btohqsg
oh ya i do out of desperation,btohqsg
imo if u dont understand u cant memo,btohqsg
plsssss i didnt even do it,btohqsg
the front part was dogshit too,btohqsg
i didnt know we hv to MEASURE the angle,btohqsg
not like i hv time to anyw,btohqsg
wah then the strato part die also,btohqsg
Plate tech for 1.5 years for me,btohqsg
earthquake is when the ground shakes,btohqsg
Bedok viewian which qn did u choose,btohqsg
Ye its easier than the other one,btohqsg
Tourism fun but idl these boring shit,btohqsg
Meanwhile...I took elective history... would have prefered literature but school dont offer :/,btohqsg
(hi to the one that just send sticker.),btohqsg
I usually play je timezone thr,btohqsg
Last time I went bugis ahh but my fren say sum machine the button broken,btohqsg
U okay usually at bugis isit,btohqsg
I went thr alot in the holidays uhh,btohqsg
Cuz je maimai can't play two ppl until like recebtly,btohqsg
I haven't play maimai for a while,btohqsg
Dats one while too long :0,btohqsg
I won't be surprised if this is gonna be the future sbq for SS,btohqsg
Because annual expense is charged at the end of the year,btohqsg
The question was asking for the transaction on the date of the beginning of the FS,btohqsg
Underlying concept tested is materiality and if it's recurring. Road tax need to pay every year.. so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Sorry Ive been living under a rock üôÉ,btohqsg
At the end of every year right,btohqsg
Yeah. In real life.. road tax paid at start of year.,btohqsg
Is not as hard as history sbq,btohqsg
Sometimes some of the sources no purpose,btohqsg
Sometimes C&C so hard to the point you do in terms of tone and attitude,btohqsg
Sometimes the source rly too hard,btohqsg
But if I‚Äôm not wrong when road tax is paid isn‚Äôt part of the POA syllabus,btohqsg
geo elect content is more than pure history,btohqsg
geo student rockss!!!! our brains are maniac,btohqsg
i slept at 5am in the end,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt say which of the two subjects is harder  but I think most people would agree that hist is more content heavy,btohqsg
between elect history and elect geog  id say elect history has slightly less content than elect geog,btohqsg
the general expense or smth one,btohqsg
Wow i come back to 37.8k messages,btohqsg
Yall better be doing NNN or else,btohqsg
I mean NNN is one step towards NNForever and i think thats pretty based,btohqsg
No anon just for fun üò≥,btohqsg
You are invited to participate in The Young SEAkers‚Äô Project ‚ÄúAre We Ready For ASEAN And China‚Äù.The Young SEAkers is a non-profit based in Singapore  with regional chapters across all 10 ASEAN countries. We aim to nurture a community of ASEAN youths change-makers passionate in advancing the interests of the ASEAN-China region. We are the first and only Southeast-Asia based non-profit focusing on youths with a China and ASEAN angle.In this inaugural survey  Singaporean youths will be asked questions about their perceptions and knowledge about the ASEAN and China regions. It will take approximately 10 minutes to complete the questionnaire.We aim to pilot this survey of on youths‚Äô perceptions  monitoring ASEAN youths‚Äô expectation  concerns  common trends and national differences about both ASEAN and China regions. We hope that our findings  which will be published in the form of a report  will shed light on the youth‚Äôs perception of these two regions.Survey link:https://tinyurl.com/AWRFAACIf you have any questions about the survey or the procedures  feel free to contact TYS by email athello@theyoungseakers.com.,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall got see the tweet posted by Ian Miles Cheong?,btohqsg
Sadge... at least you are putting in the effort so good on you bro,btohqsg
Yo uh any tips for someone who wants to take f math?,btohqsg
Is it possible to drop bio in jc for f math,btohqsg
Like take f math chem math geog,btohqsg
Their so confident in their a math?,btohqsg
I heard the a math paper was dang difficult,btohqsg
Make sure u take FMaths because u like maths  not because maths is easy,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs what I heard abt a lot from people,btohqsg
Some of my FMaths classmates took FMaths to dodge chemistry,btohqsg
Things didn‚Äôt turn out too good,btohqsg
I was thinking of taking f math to dodge bio tho,btohqsg
Not sure whether that‚Äôs a wise choice,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry  if it‚Äôs a bad choice you can always retain in J1 and take another combination,btohqsg
We can choose a totally different subject combination,btohqsg
Yes  I know people that have done that,btohqsg
Hahahaha. Not too sure about the MOE H3 maths...,btohqsg
Yes i know someone who did that and it worked,btohqsg
Because you are starting all over again. Why can't you?,btohqsg
Just if u dont mind the extra year,btohqsg
It isn‚Äôt  which is why u should be sure that the no. 1 reason u take FMaths is because u like it  not because u want to dodge something else,btohqsg
I incorrectly assumed that that carried forward into JC,btohqsg
History doesn't make any sense bruh,btohqsg
At least geog you can understand,btohqsg
isnt core subjs content heavier than any elec?,btohqsg
History is literally things that happened in real life?,btohqsg
Retain must be same subject combination,btohqsg
Thanks this kinda had a woke effect,btohqsg
Are you taking history just as a filler?,btohqsg
it prolly doesnt make sense lols,btohqsg
You have no other subjects to taken,btohqsg
even if i get A1 for both math i wldnt take fmath tho,btohqsg
But double sci need take PH,btohqsg
Ngl my subject combination probably has no future if I were to go to JC,btohqsg
I take literature and POA my man,btohqsg
FMaths and maths together means half of all your lessons are maths,btohqsg
Only arts stream for me in JC,btohqsg
And no offence to arts students but history doesn‚Äôt have many career prospects in Singapore,btohqsg
dont use gay as an insult love its not a good look,btohqsg
there are pple saying the advice that h2 math is like alr a big jump,btohqsg
I hated pure history at first,btohqsg
Can I say that like I like learning how they solve stuff in f math also which like is another driving reason as to why I‚Äôd wAnna take f math,btohqsg
Unless if you wanna be history lecturer or something,btohqsg
Not really. You still have GP  PW  MTL  if applicable,btohqsg
so unless u super duper good at doing differentiation integration then u might consider lor,btohqsg
To the point whr i only enjoyed europe history,btohqsg
Naw I‚Äôve always found history dang boring,btohqsg
i dont dare do cold war,btohqsg
USA can't beat smoll asian tho,btohqsg
Only history I‚Äôve ever cared about it is like ancient middle eastern and Mediterranean history,btohqsg
Is that a real reason or are u trying to convince urself,btohqsg
im not a jc kid so idk,btohqsg
I like the chpt but idl to write the essay,btohqsg
The elect history Cold War syllabi‚Äôs,btohqsg
Linear algebra is way easier than H2 mathematics vectors,btohqsg
Everything you guys learn in elec is the same as ours,btohqsg
i alw do sec 3 topic,btohqsg
Except we add another 2 more bk,btohqsg
But I would not enjoy learning about it from an academic standpoint,btohqsg
elec hist is a subset of pure hist,btohqsg
getting ganged by 7 nations and still winning,btohqsg
Plus my main concern at this juncture,btohqsg
Is getting good o levels certificate,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the benefits and requirements needed to take further mathematics?,btohqsg
A1 for both emath and amath,btohqsg
I just gonna deal with it,btohqsg
If you want to prove stuff the proper way  perhaps consider H3 maths in NUS/NTU. Will be closer,btohqsg
i saw req its A1 for both tho,btohqsg
I know a guy who got A2 for both,btohqsg
Yes yes I did mess up fml,btohqsg
If u wanna do math/engineering then u will have a headstart..,btohqsg
Dont let the n fool you!,btohqsg
Is nanyang jc even considered first tier,btohqsg
I notice that they don‚Äôt offer k and I,btohqsg
A staple of an elite JC,btohqsg
Okay how bout say like I‚Äôd wanna o f math but take H3 chem,btohqsg
No chance of making it there anyway,btohqsg
NY used to be bottom tier,btohqsg
Their results are above projected MOE stats every year,btohqsg
Nono it‚Äôs been pretty good since 15 years ago,btohqsg
It's tradition that gets in the way,btohqsg
Cutoff was already single digit in 2005,btohqsg
They are almost on par with RI/HC alr,btohqsg
Gone are the days IP schools dominated,btohqsg
Dont you want to go to Hwa Chong lmao,btohqsg
He said he gave up on that dream,btohqsg
Ah the JC that always fights with RI/HC for the highest %A rate for H2 Chem every year,btohqsg
Yea but it was still a dream,btohqsg
Go to vj if u wanna be intellectually stimulated in chem,btohqsg
i wan A for chem but guess it . aint happening,btohqsg
Plus the uniform looks like something out of a factory from 1960,btohqsg
He love history and hates geog,btohqsg
Coz I‚Äôm really keen on taking H3 chem,btohqsg
If I want to go to affiliated jc  must I put it as first choice?,btohqsg
Lookin down on NYJC too much,btohqsg
Truly elitist ones are RI  HCI  VJC,btohqsg
Their dist rates almost on par with RI HCI,btohqsg
U all legit too out of touch,btohqsg
Much better than my standard already,btohqsg
is vjc math phy and econs As rate good tho,btohqsg
This is wat happens when ur knowledge comes from listening to others,btohqsg
NYJC is mainly because of the hype,btohqsg
Same if not better than RI HCI,btohqsg
im ok with a shit campus but i j want a place where i can do well,btohqsg
So they attract a ton of good students,btohqsg
Is only 90 rpters that RI HCI has more,btohqsg
You base your opinion off on?,btohqsg
I think it started from 2016,btohqsg
is vjc‚Äôs econs and phy As% rate high ah,btohqsg
If n<30  by CLT ur sample isnt normally distributed and thus inaccurate,btohqsg
Well is it true Vj has been depriving?,btohqsg
Idk all the JC1 students im tutorin for chem,btohqsg
Ikr. Then whatever jc I go to in the future must be a dumpster fire,btohqsg
Like I see the cut off decreasing,btohqsg
I use NY NotesAnd they say NY notes are so good,btohqsg
Way btr than their sch notes,btohqsg
And i can also see that,btohqsg
NY has came a long way,btohqsg
Judging by him saying Nanyang is very good,btohqsg
isit bc other schs are shining instead thats why vjc kinda like,btohqsg
their cut off rise like siao,btohqsg
They all praising NY notes bro,btohqsg
1 of them in this grp,btohqsg
Wait wait so opinions on VJC are pretty good right,btohqsg
Ya if your ok with a rundown campus,btohqsg
1 person go for competitionThe whole school follows to cheer,btohqsg
im alr in a lowkey rundown sch so nthg new,btohqsg
But just wanna say something for real,btohqsg
Its not the school that produces 90 rpers,btohqsg
Is the calibre of the ppl in the school,btohqsg
Same. I used to want to go to Eunoia just to experience clean school toilets for once in my life,btohqsg
If i put current 1200 Y5 RI students in YI campus,btohqsg
Your not gonna be able to score,btohqsg
If you put in effort you can stand out among the rest,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a basic standard across all JCs,btohqsg
They can self source external resources,btohqsg
Sgexams has more than enough resources,btohqsg
To help u on top of what the sch provides,btohqsg
If u want to talk about resources  the higher tier the JC the less the teachers help u out  so,btohqsg
Jc are not suppose to be easy,btohqsg
But can you really deny it?,btohqsg
then why ya talking bad abt it,btohqsg
I watch the vlog on yt,btohqsg
JC is a walk in the park,btohqsg
Same cos i keep rekting the entire cohort,btohqsg
Cant even handle sec school lmao,btohqsg
Idk is a random boy and a girl,btohqsg
coz im scared i will die in phy and econs,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs actually better to go to worst JC if your the type that seeks aid?,btohqsg
wah shit sia ltr im the bottom in class when im in the btr sch,btohqsg
As long you have a good teacher you're in safe hands,btohqsg
At the end of the day everyone gonna take A lvl,btohqsg
wait so vj econs good rite,btohqsg
Big fish in a small pond  or small fish in a big pond,btohqsg
Unless you transfer to poly or drop out,btohqsg
Don't go to prestigious sch for fame,btohqsg
As if after doing two years of it it is so easy to do so...,btohqsg
Small fish in big pond might sometimes still be bigger than big fish in small pond,btohqsg
U just need to think straight for the next month,btohqsg
I'm so tired of hearing the pond analogy,btohqsg
On whether jc is right for u,btohqsg
i mean highlighting makes it easier,btohqsg
Why use the pond analogy when u can be the pond that swallows all?,btohqsg
i wanna be swallowed in the water in the sea,btohqsg
Wait if I‚Äôm more so focused on taking H3 chem I shld not do f math right,btohqsg
So in olvl you chose sea?,btohqsg
F math will take up a lot of time,btohqsg
Not any more than bio or physics,btohqsg
Like coz I only started liking math in sec sch,btohqsg
2 sub but honestly 1.5 sub workload,btohqsg
It's just a subject  I think chemistry will take up a lot more time,btohqsg
Not if u are actually bad in math,btohqsg
Alot of topics are just extensions of h2 math,btohqsg
You aren't doing f maths in addition  it is IN LIEU,btohqsg
Why ppl like to say chem spend so much time,btohqsg
Lmao i just see it as a normal subject,btohqsg
And just go in rekt paper only,btohqsg
i heard geog in jc p cancer tho,btohqsg
Thats why i took econs instead,btohqsg
like i heard the human geog is like,btohqsg
Geog content in a lvl is very heavy,btohqsg
Like honestly taking pure geog now ah,btohqsg
H1 geog is almost equal to h2 bio,btohqsg
And like the content is alr quite heavy,btohqsg
and i heard h2 geog is like,btohqsg
u need to make links or smth,btohqsg
If u cant memorise stuff well just do econs,btohqsg
Every subject needs u to do that,btohqsg
U can literally bring the book into the exam  with highlighting,btohqsg
i can memo but dk the content load i can cope anot,btohqsg
I felt jc was easier than sec sch,btohqsg
but a disadv is the q should be tougher,btohqsg
its either i take econs which i may not like,btohqsg
or i take geog which i end up dying in,btohqsg
Yes cause A levels is about applying knowledge,btohqsg
Ah i see a prelude into uni exam life,btohqsg
Economics is the way to go!,btohqsg
YOU CAN BRING THE WHOLE BOOK,btohqsg
Just that uni exam context even if can bring in the book  also WONT HELP HAHAHA,btohqsg
And yes that means the questions are harder,btohqsg
WITH ALL THE NOTATIONS AND HIGHLIGHTS,btohqsg
idk generally im ok with like the econs part in ss and geog,btohqsg
And during exam they‚Äôll just perform random checks on people,btohqsg
Can literally be learnt in 30hours,btohqsg
i heard econs is like geog,btohqsg
But take forever to learn how to apply,btohqsg
Its more practical than other subs still,btohqsg
I‚Äôm hoping I even make it ngl,btohqsg
people say its more versatile lor,btohqsg
My o levels I‚Äôm not very confident,btohqsg
Btw when you do chem in jc need keywords,btohqsg
Thats why dont even need to read much,btohqsg
Like in sec sch is just abt keywords,btohqsg
But I don‚Äôt take a math,btohqsg
i heard hybrid harder to be successful,btohqsg
Never really concerned myself with keywords,btohqsg
In pure chem u need or no need?U got ur answer?,btohqsg
I wonder how u got an A then,btohqsg
making the best out of the worst,btohqsg
Cambridge marker be going brrrr at John Smith,btohqsg
if what our friends here say is true.... then the worse JCs are better due to the greater amount of support,btohqsg
for eg economic impacts of tourism,btohqsg
Doesn't mean higher cut off point correlates to more support,btohqsg
Just cos a jc is 20 point doesnt mean its useless,btohqsg
What top tier JCs have to offer is not in the aspect of academics,btohqsg
Remember those JCs have lesser opportunities,btohqsg
That rly defeat the purpose the of learning chem,btohqsg
econs wayyyy more indepth and maybe harder than what u see in geog,btohqsg
I mean if u think like that,btohqsg
I also dont think u will go far in life also,btohqsg
the econs in geog is v common sense i rmb it the best,btohqsg
Is like if you like a subject then you failed cuz of keywords,btohqsg
Competitions etc. To build your portfolio,btohqsg
Research  VIA  CCA  competitions  scholarships  internships,btohqsg
And just the name of the school itself,btohqsg
but ye econs in jc issa gd choice,btohqsg
To add on  even some of the current lower tier JCs do offer them,btohqsg
My friend from neighbourhood sch say no opportunity at apl,btohqsg
Tell people ‚ÄòI RI‚Äô then they all prostrate themselves,btohqsg
Even if have  it's only for top students,btohqsg
I mean  if an RI kid tells people ‚ÄúI RI‚Äù,btohqsg
im j scared i kennot cope in jc,btohqsg
Tell people here from Bedok JC haha,btohqsg
Ah i saw. This is true,btohqsg
& i cannot get into vj,btohqsg
He means the bedok chem JC guy,btohqsg
The only way to know is to take the dive,btohqsg
VJC cut off quite low leh,btohqsg
but im sure i did btr in os,btohqsg
In my year  only two made it to VJC,btohqsg
The girl with 7 and guy with 10 got in,btohqsg
its like i am q confident i can A1 most subj except for eng chem ss / hist,btohqsg
bc i kinda fked them up,btohqsg
wew u gonna be a pcme kid?,btohqsg
im v unsure for el grade,btohqsg
cos u v zai if u A2 i def not A2 liao,btohqsg
Then turns out the 1s became 2s,btohqsg
Double maths double science!Triple science single maths!That's the way to go (pre 2006),btohqsg
no ah i damn careless dis time,btohqsg
Reminds me of 1 top student in my sch,btohqsg
They need to do this now if they want more ppl to do fmath,btohqsg
Cos all the As were 2s,btohqsg
12 u can't really go to top sch,btohqsg
im sorry i just expect not much ig,btohqsg
How can u say that John!!!,btohqsg
Good thing about A levels is that there‚Äôs no such thing as A2,btohqsg
Cos 6 A2 is like all 70 and above,btohqsg
If there was no a2 system,btohqsg
But u can't even enter higher tier JC,btohqsg
i heard bellcurve lower than 75 for comb humans tho,btohqsg
I will have been in quaffles,btohqsg
I quite like JC system of grading,btohqsg
Good thing about the A levels transcript is there is no raw score.,btohqsg
Used to be A1-F9 for AO levels...,btohqsg
there are pple who are failing ss out there tho,btohqsg
My mum be like A- for noobs,btohqsg
esp bc of the stupid sources,btohqsg
A+ and A only for top 15%,btohqsg
In some mods only top 1% lmao,btohqsg
Lol hopefully this sem i get 1,btohqsg
A- is same contribution to GPA as A I thought,btohqsg
Then my mum starts to degrade me,btohqsg
So A- is still good hahahahha,btohqsg
A- is A2 with a new name,btohqsg
so there are q a number failing ss,btohqsg
I alr estimated my sem cap,btohqsg
hist was ok j the topic v unexpected,btohqsg
im lowkey wondering the bellcurve for ss / hist,btohqsg
hist was okay   ss was hard,btohqsg
ya but people didnt expect stalin to come out,btohqsg
Hitler came out too many times alrdy,btohqsg
coz my cher convinced me to study stalin,btohqsg
the essay part was tricy   not enough time to write mucy,btohqsg
a lot of people studied stalin but didn't study collectivisation much,btohqsg
Out of 9 chpt i gamble and studied 4 chpt,btohqsg
some of my friends just studies source based chaps,btohqsg
studying 2 chapters and both of them came out,btohqsg
Imagine getting 70/100 but getting C grade,btohqsg
one soul in this group said that Hitler was gonna come out for sbcs and it no joke came out,btohqsg
But the paper is different. How can you compare?,btohqsg
Imagine the pic u sent being the grade cut offs in NUS exams,btohqsg
Wait so gp A1 used to be 75?,btohqsg
Not sure.... But C6 is pass  not E8,btohqsg
i felt like it was harder than my sch ppr,btohqsg
Based on what I felt when doing my prelims and o level.,btohqsg
some sch give hard prelim papers,btohqsg
yaa for mine ss was tougher in os,btohqsg
i too agree that ss was hard,btohqsg
Ryan your pfp rly make me salivate,btohqsg
josephine teo ruined my grades <\3,btohqsg
It is not O levels  and since E is pass for A levela  so people might assume it is E8 for AOs,btohqsg
i didn't sleep before amath papers,btohqsg
Bodok probably hates every O level subject,btohqsg
the sci and humans pprs are ok,btohqsg
paper 1 was manageable   paper 2 was hell,btohqsg
Shall see u parachuted into ministry 30 yrs later,btohqsg
