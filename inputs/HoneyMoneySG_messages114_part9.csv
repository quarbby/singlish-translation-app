Hello~ A newbie question here  for those who often have to transfer monies between different savings account to optimise the interest rate  may i know what are the recommended methods? are there any upper limit/fees for large transfer (100-200k) using FAST?,btohqsg
$200-250k usuallyOpen a joint account at the outside bank so u donâ€™t run into trouble being asked why u moving money into third party frequently.But usually will still get asked but if itâ€™s joint account itâ€™s easier to explain.,btohqsg
how about the method? FAST is okay? e.g. without any hidden fees etc,btohqsg
Has anyone stored USD in HSBC EGA? Do yall know if there is any fees or minimum holdings?,btohqsg
HSBC Ega has minimum balance requirements of sgd2k equivalent (across all currencies) if u are retail banking. $5 fall below fee.No fees for storing usd.,btohqsg
Yea so if I have 2k SGD in the account..i can just move USD in and out the account without issues right?,btohqsg
How do u intend to move the usd in and out of the account.,btohqsg
To be more specific  I am considering moving Brokerages  where I move USD from one brokerage into EGA then into another brokerage without converting to SGD. I guess the question is whether this will work,btohqsg
U would likely incur fees thriceOnce for receiving usd into hsbc EgaOnce for tt out usd from hsbc egaOnce for receiving usd in your target brokerAnd this assumes your first usd out from broker has tt out fees waived.,btohqsg
Oh there is a fee for EGA to receive and send USD?,btohqsg
Yes.The only bank that I know of that can send usd out free of charge is scb. But itâ€™s conditional on the receiving brokerâ€™s custodian bank.A very specific exampleUSD sitting in my scb foreign currency esaver could be remitted 100% free of charge into interactive brokers usd account (I canâ€™t remember I think it was Jp Morgan New York).,btohqsg
Oh thank you very much! I guess its probably more worth to convert to SGD first and move it.,btohqsg
Yes since it only cost usd2 to convert at spot rate and sgd receive is usually free for us.But u face usd/sgd fluctuations.,btohqsg

You should consider opening another HYSA like HSBC EGA then.,btohqsg
I find Ega very confusing from their website.  Still trying to understand whether got the tier system and whether needs spending etc etc.,btohqsg
UOB Stash account already at 3% p.a.  putting 150k will reduce it further to 2.6% p.a. even with the $1000 cash credit. Might as well put in fixed deposits.,btohqsg
2 t&cs to focus on:1. HSBC EGA Bonus Interest Promo (for 3.6% p.a.)2. HSBC Everyday+ Rewards (for 1% p.a.)The base interest given by HSBC EGA is 0.05% p.a.  which will add up to 4.65% p.a.,btohqsg
