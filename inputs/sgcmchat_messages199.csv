One is a ship  you’re a pile of shit,btohqsg
There ws a whole van crash,btohqsg
as in they crashed the party or they crashed cars,btohqsg

But got TP camping outside timmac after the meet,btohqsg
Yo these pics quite nice eh,btohqsg
I dont do car photography a lot,btohqsg
What are some apps good for editing videos for tiktok?,btohqsg
Does anyone know any shop in Singapore or any mall that have a store that sells die-cast car or mini gt car or tomica things??(Serious question and serious answer please🙏🙏😭😭),btohqsg
carousell is probably your best bet in terms of variety and cost,btohqsg
There is one at raffles  google it you should find some results,btohqsg
There is one at sunshine plaza selling,btohqsg
Hi all selling 4x100 15x7JJ ET35 TE37 in Bronze pls PM if you wish to purchase 🙏 Thanks,btohqsg

i drive a 3 seater mclaren f1 so i'm full up sorry,btohqsg
i’m coming but idw drive u,btohqsg
i will only be driving the great akhil rai who is going to be a chef,btohqsg
how does sg exhaust swap works? if swap at third party workshop but got cert all,btohqsg
does my friend need to do transfer of ownership?,btohqsg
Cert is written in another car. U need to go back to the original distributor to have them inspect and issue u another letter.Make appointment with LTA for inspection before it can be changed under your nameNote that during inspection  it cannot fail. It would be a full exhuast from header down to muffler inspection.,btohqsg
cert needs to be under owner name lor,btohqsg
stolen license as well. not an officially licensed LBWK model iinw,btohqsg
the rights are with inno and minigt,btohqsg
but uk my stand on it la,btohqsg
ok la end of the day idl the colour,btohqsg
i barely like the kit so…,btohqsg
always liked the super silhouette livery on it,btohqsg
“it’s a very clean build” - xdd,btohqsg
especially going with the NA engines,btohqsg
the kit with the livery is nice,btohqsg
instead of the RIP POLE WANKER SUPRA BOOST,btohqsg
same goes for the RX7 kit,btohqsg
i unironically like the countach one,btohqsg
quite controversial and all  but it looks like a Kyza render,btohqsg
so outrageous that it works lor,btohqsg
wld get rid of the wing thi,btohqsg
it takes hints from the JLOC Countach that ran in JGTC,btohqsg
the F40 is chef kiss too,btohqsg
if u gave that to BN Sports it would come out bad,btohqsg
the white one was not bad  recent inozetek blue one was good too,btohqsg
i wish the wing followed the shape more but since it’s racing thats ok,btohqsg
generic  but they have a very long history,btohqsg
Fun fact: TransCab also has Renault latitude taxis but alot of them has been scrapped and re-registered as Toyota Prius  so only a few units left,btohqsg
> 1000km per tank> choo choo noises> mountain of torque,btohqsg
what is drop a gear and disappear,btohqsg
ain't got time to drop a gear,btohqsg
just stomp on it and disappear,btohqsg
lawmakers want you to think diesels are toxic because of the NOx emissions,btohqsg
but diesels consume much less per km than petrols,btohqsg
so at the end of the day it still works out,btohqsg
if you consume 20L of petrol going a certain distance you're burning that much hydrocarbons,btohqsg
Fk it go back to coal powered,btohqsg
in the end it's the next generation that's suffering,btohqsg
if you consume 10L of diesel going the same distance you're letting out half the emissions,btohqsg
fuck it we do it flintstones style,btohqsg
just wear thicc ass shoes and walk yourself there,btohqsg
i want to be one with the ground,btohqsg
straight pipe diesel sounds hella cool,btohqsg
i miss when cool diesels were a thing,btohqsg
i mean i took my entire muffler off and it made no difference,btohqsg
cause the DPF and cat were strangling it so much,btohqsg
should just remove my muffler entirely and go inspection,btohqsg
watch as vicom tries to probe a nonexistent exhaust,btohqsg
Yup  I have yet to board one this year,btohqsg
the VW XL1 was neat too,btohqsg
only logical if you have money,btohqsg
more than 4 cylinders means you need money alr,btohqsg
4 cylinder european diesels are already a maintenance nightmare because of how much they have going on in the engine bay,btohqsg
not because the engine is a heap,btohqsg
but its a pain in the ass to work on,btohqsg
surprisingly the merc diesels can go on forever though,btohqsg
most engines will go forever if maintained frequently,btohqsg
the 212 diesel cabs we have can hit 1.6+ million kms,btohqsg
always take warmup and cooldown seriously,btohqsg
and i don't mean sit in the carpark for 10 minutes,btohqsg
shit maintenance schedule to boot too,btohqsg
30 secs for oil to flow,btohqsg
just cold start and whack limiter,btohqsg
drive gently for next 10 mins,btohqsg
and then send it for the rest of the journey,btohqsg
it is important that diesels are driven HARD to keep them healthy,btohqsg
people starting tonner first thing in the morning and sending the pistons through the roof,btohqsg
proper warmup procedure> start car> ensure rev limiter works immediately> ensure it works throughout the drive,btohqsg
saf paid for limiter  use the limiter,btohqsg
sometimes the first step is unachievable already,btohqsg
with enough cursing and swearing it will start,btohqsg
> start car> car no start> VOR,btohqsg
i just achieved 220k on my french diesel last night,btohqsg
never opened  0 CEL faults since day 1,btohqsg
frequently driven at 3x the speed limit,btohqsg
its due for many things which i absolutely dread,btohqsg
cos that means spending an entire day UNDER the damn thing cursing and swearing,btohqsg
i don't have a lift i only have a floor jack and stands,btohqsg
but i'm thankful none of those things are the engine,btohqsg
its just consumables like bearings  brakes  bushings  balljoints,btohqsg
a rarity for something that's viva la france honestly,btohqsg
french diesels commonly find their way into many things,btohqsg
ford and volvo 1.6 diesel cars use the peugeot DV series engine,btohqsg
the same DV4 that's in the berlingo van,btohqsg
had a friend whose dad had a kangoo  engine blew up within 2 months LOL,btohqsg
was it the very old one,btohqsg
no leh  probably within the past decade?,btohqsg
that's a surprise cause the diesel kangoo's K9K is extremely reliable,btohqsg
especially the one i have which is the 3rd gen engine on the gen 2 facelift kangoo,btohqsg
his was the 2nd gen one,btohqsg
same engine you get in an A180d,btohqsg
they're very sensitive to poor maintenance,btohqsg
bearings will shit the bed if you don't keep up with oil changes,btohqsg
bought brand new  2nd month in jibaboom,btohqsg
the other problem being  if you're the kind to use tap water in the expansion tank  the oil cooler will corrode internally and mix oil and water,btohqsg
he probably got the car built between friday and monday,btohqsg
i take care of over 20 kangoos,btohqsg
they're all gen 2 facelift LWBs,btohqsg
the QC is really bad especially when it comes to things like door alignment,btohqsg
the thing ships with barn doors that don't close properly,btohqsg
they rub on each other and there's a gap where water comes in when it rains,btohqsg
there's also weird ones where the door cards aren't mounted correctly then you get funny lumps in the plastic,btohqsg
tbf the french rub each other often too,btohqsg
the engines have been good though,btohqsg
so far none have required a motor replacement,btohqsg
although 3 have gone in for blowing the oil coolers but that's a maintenance problem,btohqsg
idiots putting water in the system instead of coolant,btohqsg
2  have blown their plastic charge pipes,btohqsg
and i need a clutch master cos there's a batch problem where the o rings disintegrate and you get a 1mm biting point,btohqsg
truly a french thing to do,btohqsg
there are truly a lot of quirks,btohqsg
for example the aircon that turns into a block of ice while you drive,btohqsg
so you suddenly get zero airflow,btohqsg
first car sure 3 series touring,btohqsg
i see his name ik alr,btohqsg
remove the “sian” wat do u get?,btohqsg
u singaporean but remove the aporean u still won’t sing,btohqsg
do i look like ben kheng to u,btohqsg

with the amount of people revving  pop & bangs  maybe certain car meets have to introduced diff rules tbh,btohqsg
those who did rev  pop & bang do note we were in a residential area  there were animals near you as well :)it’s not very nice,btohqsg
& PLEASE  stop asking the cars to rev.,btohqsg
photographers please pm me  i will collate a list & give yall a s/o!,btohqsg
this is the most retarded thing you kids were doing. unless you want everyone to get permanent hearing damage  then keep it up.spare a thought for the hosts  for the people around and most importantly THE VENUE,btohqsg
without the venue this meet wouldn't have happened. so if it was you that was doing the burnout  grow a pair of balls and have some sense.,btohqsg
do also remember that this is a PRIVATE CARPARK and the management have the legal rights to sue and make reports to the authorities,btohqsg
cbdivision will have a field day,btohqsg
xdds running amok? ✅retards revving and banging despite the poster already informing? ✅near accidents? ✅,btohqsg
lmao when u idiots get the court summons don't go asking for gofundmes or whatnot,btohqsg
whoever this joker was i hope you own up... not funny,btohqsg
the organisers have done their best. you're a fuckhead and you drag the meets and the community as a whole down for your 15 seconds of fame.,btohqsg
i'm getting messages that some people have already reported to SPF and TP. they don't need to own up.,btohqsg
have to pull out all the gods mcm f1 track to do this,btohqsg
wouldnt be surprised if ppl start defending the rider,btohqsg
TL;DR Future meets will have TP & other governing bodies to improve on crowd control. Those who do break the rules may be reported to the relevant authorities.🫶🏼🥰😇Hi all  regarding the recent meet that has happened.Footage presented has shown that burnouts were done in the carpark during the meet itself. This is highly irresponsible and disrespectful to organisers and the property this was done on. We highly prohibit such actions especially at car meets. On top of this  reports of people running around  multiple near accidents and more irresponsible behaviour done were made. We also prohibit these actions too.The community and such meets are based upon the cooperation of the participants and spectators that attend and socialise but it seems that such rules and advises have fallen on death ears to not one but many people. We here at SCM believe that much can be done to prevent such issues if people were to be cooperative and respectful.On this note. We would like to push out a couple pointers after the recent car meet held.1. Be respectful & thoughtful- Respect is at the core of everyone. We all grew up being taught about values in school  especially respect. If you can respect the people around you and your loved ones  why can't you do the same for others? Their property? Stuff that isn't yours? Think about what you do before you do it and how it may affect others.2. Read the rules- Rules are the base of society  without it  it would be chaos and unjust. Hence why they are in place to keep order in place. Rules are placed to ensure that rowdiness does not take over the meets and disrupt others who are not partaking in it. If one breaks the rules it will continue on a chain reaction in which no one will bother and we do not want that.3. Help the community- By adhering to rules and having basic respect  we can make meets more friendly and accepted by the general public. Agencies like TP & LTA have been clamping down on such issues in the past and present but we don't wish to give them a reason to red-light everything.We hope this sends a message across to everyone. That its not just about you but to all who wish to appreciate and deepen their passion for cars.,btohqsg
monkey business not allowed here btw 😇,btohqsg
At least he learnt from this now,btohqsg
there are alternate angles that were shot,btohqsg
Hello everyone  I am the rider in the video and from the bottom of my heart  i sincerely apologise to everyone who was affected by my action especially the organisers. I had no intent on causing a commotion or disrupting the event. Like everyone that was present  I was hyped over what was going on at the moment with the cars and other bikes revving and popping and to my knowledge  there was another biker that also did a burn out so I thought “why not” but nonetheless I should’ve known better and adhered by the rules set by the organisers regardless. My action is in no way justifiable nor is it something that I am proud of  should I have known that it would be an issue and in any way disrupt the meet  best believe I wouldn’t have done what I did. I hope by coming out and owning to my mistake  shows to everyone that I do realise what I did was wrong and I understand the frustration I have caused. Once again  i truly do apologise.,btohqsg
Big thanks to SCM for organizing. The meet had retrohavoc vibes  NGL. Yea it was hot af but that’s the underground feel innit  no wind! Hope to have more of these. To those that pop and bang at the venue and around it until phone calls are made to authorities by nearby residents  hope u understand the damage you are doing to the car scene. When venue owners by default reject organizer request and police are called to even the quiet meets where everyone behaves  its already too late. Peace out,btohqsg
next time i bring my pots and pans,btohqsg
pop and bang back at those who pop and bang,btohqsg
inshallah the spatula flies towards someones taillight,btohqsg
