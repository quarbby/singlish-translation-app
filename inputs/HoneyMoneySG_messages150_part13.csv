Hi  is this list exhaustive? If I make a purchase contactless (MCC 5943)  (paired with Amaze) that isn‚Äôt in this 10x points eligible transaction list. Will I miss out?,btohqsg
This list is for contactless spend. Check the online spend clause.,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt find the clause in the T&C (or at least im not sure which part haha) but I saw this on MileLion. So means anything qualifies for 10x points then.. of course as long as I pair with Amaze?,btohqsg
