alot scrap alr ah I think,btohqsg
I asked the agent she say can renew,btohqsg
Maybe cos the parts hard to find,btohqsg
why u blur the details ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Just wanna make sure I buy my first car properly,btohqsg
MRS is not a new driver friendly car.. snap-oversteer is what caused many to scrap üòÇ,btohqsg
Then maybe get a BRZ or Fairlady,btohqsg
Wa. Need to earn abit to get lei. Expensive car,btohqsg
I'm trying to cap it below 100k haha,btohqsg
you already power of dreams la hahah,btohqsg
Need to get a job first,btohqsg
this was the geobaz bumper üòÇ,btohqsg
I think getting a job is not hard,btohqsg
Staying in the job is the harder part,btohqsg
Most I know keep their jobs,btohqsg
have you driven any of the mid engine toyotas?,btohqsg
He himself also spun out before,btohqsg
i only spin on track before. Public road i hope not. LOL,btohqsg
ive driven a cayman and the mr2 before,btohqsg
tyres  rain  traction control  how fast you going.,btohqsg
i think the angmohs over exaggerate the snap oversteer thing for the mid engine rwd cars,btohqsg
i wont say it's exaggerated. It's physics.,btohqsg
fwd snap over steer usually is driver error sia,btohqsg
any car can crash  it's just whether the bag of meat behind the wheel is smart enough to avoid,btohqsg
no matter what  RWD is more prone to snap oversteer than FWD. And MR definitely more prone to snap than FR too,btohqsg
fwd snap oversteer is fun if you can control it well,btohqsg
heck even F1 ars also snap oversteer,btohqsg
had a cayman friend spin on NSHW when it was raining. going straight some more,btohqsg
MR car rotates around the middle. definitely diff from FR,btohqsg
if you really want to drive an MR car  drive w a bit of caution and slowly learn the characteristics,btohqsg
rwd turns on throttle. fwd turns off throttle. in simple terms,btohqsg
Yes  but MR turns when it wants to without warning,btohqsg
They're more sensitive to throttle inputs and weight transfer for sure. More so than FR. 'Without warning' is when the driver doesn't know what he's doing üòÇ,btohqsg
The buffer for error for MR is thinner than FR or FF üòÇ,btohqsg
Aiya but nowadays with good suspension set up and tyres u can minimize the chance of snap oversteer unless you‚Äôre still using 14inch wheels with some tourador tyres,btohqsg
Why you h8ing on them 14‚Äù rims,btohqsg
Wah  i can't even fit 15inch rims,btohqsg
Brother u using how many inch sia,btohqsg
Last time i put 16  i barely clear stock brakes,btohqsg
the caliper like just 5mm away from the rim,btohqsg
thickness maybe 2 or 3 50cent,btohqsg
@DLTH22u see even roi using 17inch,btohqsg
MR2 i think on 17inch nice,btohqsg
i think 17 too big for mr2,btohqsg
i really wanted to run 16 inch for my miat,btohqsg
but i think i wanna run wider,btohqsg
I'm alr considering wider 17inch or i run 18 inch,btohqsg
wider rims ah  so wider tyre profile,btohqsg
wah so wide need roll fender or not,btohqsg
but I running quite high camber,btohqsg
