Must you use MatLab? There are VERY FEW reasons I can think of for forcing matlab.,btohqsg
I mean some uni mods do teach matlab in a linear algebra mod,btohqsg
Python can do most of the stuff,btohqsg
as long as u dont game or use anyth that needs high processing power,btohqsg
That's because the prof very outdated,btohqsg
Numpy is more for data science,btohqsg
On the other hand  if you are doing extreme amounts of number crunching  py lags far behind,btohqsg
Linear al  vector cal  stats all can use numpy,btohqsg
ive been using mac for 4 years no problem for me  just some games cannot run,btohqsg
??????????????????????????????functionally they are not very different,btohqsg
Py wins in terms of on the fly experimentation,btohqsg
Again  this is only if you are interested in certain specific R pkgs,btohqsg
ive been using my laptop for 5 yrs but its starting to die alrd,btohqsg
Matlab vs numpy is a stupid discussion,btohqsg
R has terrible memory management from what I see/tried,btohqsg
Still it is efficient for generating visualisations,btohqsg
I really don't see how you can pre-know if you will use MatLab and/or can justify the massive software cost it entails,btohqsg
Lol I thought we discussing what pc to buy,btohqsg
Perhaps it’s time to start talking about Mac vs windows again,btohqsg
Now we argue about which language to use,btohqsg
Very simple  just stick to FOSS,btohqsg
Python and R are both FOSS,btohqsg
Julia too if you're into that,btohqsg
I'm thinking he doesn't know shit about what u are talking,btohqsg
mac windows debate is retarded  just use what works well for u and what u can afford,btohqsg
ok ok I simplify: if it's NOT FREE  DON'T USE IT,btohqsg
Yes  it means you can SAGE but not WolframAlpha Pro,btohqsg
why so many data people here,btohqsg
Data is the next oil lol,btohqsg
Many ppl here doing data analytics？,btohqsg
Starting to learn but not expert at it,btohqsg
Those two things sounds highly subjective,btohqsg
As long as your machine can run .js,btohqsg
If u just want to learn the coding is easy,btohqsg
I know the coding. I wanna know the math behind it,btohqsg
I did use it for my sch computers,btohqsg
It was not exactly user friendly for me,btohqsg
The stats and math behind machine learning need to read up,btohqsg
Or watch andrew ng on youtube,btohqsg
NIPS comes up with new shit every year,btohqsg
Go online download a book on it,btohqsg
Doesn't mean I know what mixture gaussian is,btohqsg
If you can tell me you are updated on NIPS pls teach me,btohqsg
Anything you say can be and will be used ahainst you,btohqsg
It's a mixture of gaussians  and I assume it's basically a convex combination of gaussians,btohqsg
You get a 5-centred gaussian and another gaussian centered at -0.5  You assign non-negative weights adding up to 1 to both of them  this is a mixture gaussian,btohqsg
General mixture gaussian means you have N (for some int) gaussians  all with weights. If you can do negative weights you are magic liao  cuz AFAIK only convex combi (aka weights adding up to 1) makes sense,btohqsg
This group become data science liao,btohqsg
ok long story short WHY useful?Cuz 1 gaussian is SHIT at fitting data,btohqsg
Can u explain principal component analysis,btohqsg
