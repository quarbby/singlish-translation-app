My brother bought it but never play,btohqsg
Cuz he in camp all the time,btohqsg
I pray that I will never meet you,btohqsg
But he dw to play with his bunk mates,btohqsg
Not that the other Kranji camp people use the sch v facilities though,btohqsg
He told me he anyhow march the sergeant also dc,btohqsg
And sometimes his platoon need to do 60 pushup but the sergeant reduce to 20,btohqsg
Probably varies from sgt to sgt,btohqsg
And ntu uni also somewhr thr,btohqsg
Time to be occifer in 1GDS,btohqsg
Yeah  because linear algebra is more abstract  H2 mathematics vectors is so computational. And wordy.,btohqsg
But H2 vectors is easier to und no?,btohqsg
Theres a reason why abstract maths is a field of its own,btohqsg
The way I was taught H2 vectors impeded my broader understanding,btohqsg
Took a lot of effort to undo the learning and learn the correct way,btohqsg
It's the real mathematics. But very art not science,btohqsg
No  it is just these are the formulas  take it for it is  this is how you compute it.I hate it and I have no understanding of it,btohqsg
Also if you introduced covectors to high school students they'd be very confused,btohqsg
I was taught this in Year 1 university mathematics:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_basis,btohqsg
Cartesian coordinates are so overused that a lot of texts don't bother to differentiate between the two,btohqsg
There are also the spherical and cylindrical coordinates  among others.,btohqsg
Yeah but Cartesian is where vectors and covectors are indistinguishable,btohqsg
I had to search it  as we didn't use the term,btohqsg
I dont think is comparable to NUS,btohqsg
NUS is rly on a whole new level,btohqsg
Is that a good or bad level,btohqsg
Doesn't matter what you learn in NUS. What matters is if you are able to become an outstanding mathematician,btohqsg
Good if u like mathBad if u think u are good in math but actually not,btohqsg
Simply put  linear maps from vectors to real numbers,btohqsg
I know a mathematician that didn't like NUS. Sorry. Said it was lousy,btohqsg
No  to scalars which are elements of the field,btohqsg
Remember that in uni  we don't just assume real,btohqsg
It has to be a generic field,btohqsg
Most people  even in maths  aren't in maths to become mathematicians  let alone outstanding ones,btohqsg
Okay... But it isn't correct when people assume real  in general,btohqsg
Or do data analysis or something. I don't really know because I don't really care. Sorry,btohqsg
dancing man in the dancing world,btohqsg
what does üÖ±Ô∏èinance have to do with F1,btohqsg
It's an F1 running joke that has to do with Ferrari. The üÖ±Ô∏è to me at least is synanomous with that joke.,btohqsg
It will scare anyone not in RI,btohqsg
If you don't get 90RP  it's not the end...,btohqsg
They had 6 people who did 2H3s and got distinctions in all 9 subjects,btohqsg
There are 6 with 9 distinction and 72 with 8 distinction,btohqsg
Means double H3 and single H3,btohqsg
If they were all that good  we would see a 95+% distinction rate  with everyone else B,btohqsg
But I worry for the 2percent tho,btohqsg
But people that can do that aren't exceedingly well in one area. There is always a trade off,btohqsg
Kumar aiming for the 8 distinction,btohqsg
Like distinction in all 9 with having to cope with 2 H3s,btohqsg
Idt anyone in my sch can get 9 distinction,btohqsg
