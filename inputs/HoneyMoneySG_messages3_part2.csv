How come I see young couples mid 20s/30s can afford 5 room flat ah? Must be some crypto god's or bought Tesla in 2010 kind ? Or earn 10K a month?,btohqsg
got CPF OA to cover a portion of the monthly repayment ma.,btohqsg
But my CPF is for my retirement eh. Even if use cpfoa need to repay with interest isn't it. Not worth leh...,btohqsg
Well depends on how you look at it. at least for me property is a very good investment vehicle. just that if u want to run it at higher level  the capital outlay will get bigger and bigger. A BTO could be your first pot of gold to do it.There are always costs involved in everything we do be it time or money.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs your timeframe? Do you sell call or put weekly or bi weekly?,btohqsg
Only selling puts now 30-45d for max time decay.No fixed pattern  depends on mood,btohqsg
Any video for Hougang Olive or Tanjong Tree ?,btohqsg
Good morning üîÜI am new to using MooMoo  and have 2 qns .(1) when we make an initial deposit  do we use eg. DBS multi currency account? Do we select Sgd/usd in moomoo app?(2) if I would like to buy a US STOCK and want to deduct from the deposit account  does it mean the initial deposit should be in USD? Or the deposit currency doesn't matter?,btohqsg
SGDYou can deposit in SGD.Then convert SGD to USD in Moomoo app  then buy the US stock in USD,btohqsg
Also make sure you hit the min initial deposit to get your 1 FREE AAPL STOCK,btohqsg
And make sure you used my referral linkhttps://bit.ly/sgmoomoo,btohqsg
Can the free apple stock be transferred out without any minimum trades in moomoo?,btohqsg
# Please note that the allocated Apple Share will be issued automatically within 3 business days. User will need to maintain daily average assets of above SGD 2 700 / USD 2 000 / HKD 16 000 for 30 days from share allocation; only after can the allocated Apple Share be activated and traded.

Any kind soul able to answer my query on options? If I sell a put option and ON EXPIRY the stock price is above my strike price (which means a correct prediction for sell put)  do I still get assigned to buy 100 shares?In short  I sell a put option and on expiry my prediction is right  do I still get assigned to buy 100 shares?,btohqsg
Any kind souls care to tell me how to invest SnP500 on MOOMOO?,btohqsg
You sold a put and didn't hit strike price  it will expire worthless i.e. you don't have to buy a put to cover.But actually should let@boontee86answer,btohqsg
So I just search$SPYon MooMoo right?,btohqsg
What's the difference between Voo and SPY,btohqsg
But VOO has lower expense ratio of 0.03 Vs 0.09,btohqsg
So VOO is more cost efficient. üëç,btohqsg
Will you please explain that in layman term? What‚Äôs expense ratio? Haha! Thank you.,btohqsg
It means is a small cost u Habe to pay for holding the etf. Means if u Have 1000 in VOO u pay 0.3$. it is included in the price alr so u don't have to do anything,btohqsg
Woah! Learnt a lot from this group. GY  do you personally think snp 500 is a good time to go in now? Will still only get higher and higher lol,btohqsg
Buying index funds are actually a good way for beginners to begin investing üëç cos it has in built diverisification (top 500 US companies)  low cost.,btohqsg
In terms of timing it's rly hard to time the market so you could just hold the etf for the long term üëç so expect some slight fluctuations but it won't flucate as much as individual stocks,btohqsg
I sold a put option means I‚Äôm bullish. The stock price is above my strike price (means I predicted correctly). Expire worthless means I get to keep my premium and I don‚Äôt have the obligation to buy 100 shares right?,btohqsg
One of my favourite GIFs from@boontee86I PM you lol,btohqsg
You're right shifu. It will expire worthless üëçüèª,btohqsg
@boontee86Expire worthless means it's out of the money put option right ? If it's in the money then need to forced to buy 100 shares?,btohqsg
You already received the premiums when you sold the options. So the option position will appear in your portfolio as a negative amount. If it expire worthless means this negative amount will trending to 0 then eventually removed from your portfolio (usually during Saturday),btohqsg
Don't call me shifu lah  paiseh,btohqsg
Everyone is shifu  we all learning from one another,btohqsg
