Uhh April Poly start many new students will have to buy laptops as well,btohqsg
So all apple products have discount for students price?,btohqsg
But if u r in no rush to get a new one rn  u can wait until Sept to buy a students discounted one cuz by then new MacBook Airs M4 wouldâ€™ve dropped and they will come packaged tgt with AirPods,btohqsg
typically I would aim  when apple starts to giveaway AirPods  or Apple Pencils when purchasing MacBook / iPads?,btohqsg
remember to use Apple Education Store to purchase to buy tho,btohqsg
if youre looking for Windows then there will be some available already.But by April new MacBook Airs M4 would've dropped too.,btohqsg

Well many years ago when I was on sec 1,btohqsg
I managed to get windows server 2008 os (as a student) using school email,btohqsg
So I assuming your email domain need to get recognised by apple education store,btohqsg
If you want drop them a call  Poly typically email address domain for students,btohqsg
Yes the key is legit   no trial,btohqsg
If u student can get it free uh,btohqsg
Technically can be used like desktop os too but not recommended,btohqsg
Check if your school eligible for it first,btohqsg
Nowadays ppl use Windows server 2025 liao,btohqsg
So I assuming it is updated with latest server os as well,btohqsg
Btw I'm a member of the Windows Insider Programme,btohqsg
JC can also. Just sign in using the school email on Unidays onApple.com,btohqsg
If you into computer science then can even download developer grade software and server OS from Microsoft like what I did in secondary 1 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I in fact installed active directory services back then   quite thrilling for me,btohqsg
I saw shopee selling airtag for like 34,btohqsg
Ooh yea..does anyone uses clara libra?,btohqsg
Is it a tech bug issue that clara can't seem to sync with overdrive?,btohqsg
Or is the device officially gone ripðŸª¦?,btohqsg

The 3D printer broke the filament,btohqsg

I need that object for my report :D,btohqsg
And that object is not done yet,btohqsg
Wait why are you in lab,btohqsg
My partner went past the lab but saw the cylinder was not there,btohqsg
So I went to the lab,btohqsg
