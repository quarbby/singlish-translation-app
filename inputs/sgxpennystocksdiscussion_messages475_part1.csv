This funding is done to many virus Laboratories to assist in isolating  predicting and finding cures. I don't think one should read much into it.The only way to deal with this now is vaccine and treatment. Rest of the world just learn from China. Vaccinate as many as you can and if infected treat it like common cold and get on with life.,btohqsg
Yea this virus is here to stay. Aim zero case too far fetched. Have to live with it,btohqsg

Dear Hustlepeople Good day.Trading or investment is never easy.I believe 99% of people that is currently doing really well in stock market are those that have lost a lot at some point of time. We have seen the lowest but have found a way to get back on our feet.It’s not impossible but it takes hell of a lot of hard work to improve one’s knowledge and skills.As usual  Let me emphasise the importance of stop loss. This  to me is the most important on whether you survive this game or not.Good luck  hustle hard and hope this upcoming week is a good one 🙏🏻,btohqsg
If one uses DBS vickers  they do not have stop loss function. How else to cut loss (without active monitoring due to work schedule)??,btohqsg
Perhaps it's time to change to a better broker..,btohqsg

Not sure about that. I think China wants to the future hegemonic super power and going all out. US don't want to give up. Who is wrong and who is right is purely a matter of opinion and who you want to be the winner. Very interesting times ahead.,btohqsg

Ask Pika Nat Series#1Welcome to the first episode of the Ask Pika Nat Series  where we share some insights from curated questions.Let’s begin.Is Intel latest corporate move in a positive direction?Pika World views the reported bidding for GlobalFoundries by Intel as a good deal which is part of Intel’s overall strategy discussed in our prior updates. In addition  Intel has a plan to double its manufacturing business under CEO Pat Gelsinger leadership. So  we see the act as a natural fit for the plan.It will also empower Intel to become a contract manufacturer and provides the company with new fabrication plants and a considerable base of customers. That also comes with the niche in sales and marketing expertise to expand this field of business.The bid also provides the idea of a foundry business that served a multitude of clients. It is an area where Intel appears to be lacking in its business proposition. Moreover  in the chip business  it is known that GlobalFoundries has long-term agreements with their customers that could be lucrative for Intel  given that GlobalFoundries is based mainly on older manufacturing tech.Now  these customers would have the choice to transit to Intel’s more advanced or some would call “leading node” processor fabrication techniques. Some of GlobalFoundries customers include big names like Qualcomm and AMD. Hence  it appears to be a complementary strategic move.Given that the US is keen to expand the domestic chip-making business  we would see minor regulatory hurdles as it sails through different levels of approval by the government.Is Moderna a buy?Before 2020  it is pretty clear that few  if any  would have heard of the Massachusetts-based biotech firm. However  things are significantly different as Moderna is now a household name. Its inclusion into S&P 500 further cemented the recognition it deserves as the company answered the call of humanity (in some sense) to develop the Covid-19 vaccine. Since then  it has been administered to hundreds of millions of arms worldwide.There’s some brand value in the business. However  investors are often forward-looking- they are concern with the situation Moderna will be in when the need for vaccine subsides.There are some possible answers to the question. First  the growing spread of new Covid variants led investors to believe with some certainty that the vaccine business is likely to maintain a robust foot into 2022 as Covid vaccine sales will be substantial. There is aspiration in Moderna to further its success into a combined flu and Covid jab in the near term with other possible drugs in the pipeline.All this point to the deterrence of a single outcome- that Moderna will hopefully not be a one-hit-wonder kind of company.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to more people.,btohqsg
