Amaze has cash back still? I tot it is to reduce foreign ccy charges. Can show where you got this?,btohqsg
Which credit card give best cash back for China Eastern ? Trust cash back 1%  any other better than this?,btohqsg
Amaze no longer has cashback but citi rewards has.Just want to know if it still can cover ccy markup,btohqsg
"How would you know that they have ""strengthened their management execution""?No one knew about their issues until this ""crisis"".Their operations issue didn't blow up because they were small  imagine what would happened if they were managing billions.",btohqsg
How quickly they have been cutting their interest is a sign that their mouth is saying things their body cannot deliver.,btohqsg
amaze still good for fcy spending,btohqsg
Yes I have the same question,btohqsg
Stability matters. All firms start small. No one fund house comes in big  strong… takes time to build trust  execution by the team  management  look at Aberdeen Group. The difference is the evolving ways of investments.. over the years where usage of apps are more prevalent  speed is a necessity to most  funds transfers etc and expectations of investors. No one knows Lehman will collapse.. is unexpected  and based on its repute  is shocking. Nothing comes free  higher interest rates come with a cost  but the question is whether you want to take the bait. Do the necessary due diligence and find the answer yourself.Interest rates are declining everywhere  is not slashes/ cuts of interests from one firm  CF. All banks do that abruptly.,btohqsg
CF did not manage this appropriately. Corporate Governance is the key.. and many times the failures led to collapse of FIs. So other than the credentials of the management  time will tell whether they manage their systems  process well,btohqsg
Q4 2024 prestige limo rebate in!,btohqsg
Asking for a friend who switch from employed to self employed and have hdb loan to pay. Advisable to top up 20% of income cpf to all 3 accounts or use cash to pay for loan better?,btohqsg
Trust give cash back for insurance ?,btohqsg
"But no banks have ever stopped the usage of their debit cards.To me the biggest issue is that they have no integrity.First they blamed AXS for ending that mode of payment (which they later quietly changed the reason)  and second blame the customers for being ""too smart"" instead of admitting that they didn't think through their program.The termination/suspension of instant withdrawal and then the use of debit card is also an example that they are not able to handle money management business.The boss should return to managing insurance and stay away from money management.You have your own views and requirements but they are different from mine.We just have to accept that they are different.",btohqsg
I don’t deny your stance.Let’s just see whether they improve holistically from a management point of view. Trust is built over time.,btohqsg
To be clear (if I wasn't)  I'm never going to give them any business.Their interest rates are now no different from other options so no point to risk my money with them 😄,btohqsg
My point is that  there is no way to assess their integrity until a crisis and that is when you need your funds most urgently.,btohqsg
Sure. Is your funds  of course the entitlement to your rights and views.But no way to access any company’s integrity until crisis happened  is not just Chocolate Finance.,btohqsg
why does amex card min income requirement is conditional while the rest is standard 30k or above ?,btohqsg
Cash flow or income tax reduction purposes.  See which he emphasised. And better check himself too. As if swap halfway the cpf contribution cap is by the $8000 rstu/vcma or the cpf annual limit.,btohqsg
Hi All  I was informed if put 100k in uob one account could get about $400 per month  anything better than this please? Thank you 🙏,btohqsg
There's a calculator on the UOB One website. You can verify it yourself. I checked for you and it says $3375 pure interest p.a. on 100k,btohqsg
Ic  anything better than this please?🙏,btohqsg
4.65% if you check the website yeah  personally never understood how the save mechanism works so i went with UOB One.,btohqsg
Does anyone know UOB visa signature 8099 payment bypaywaveeligible for 4mpd? Don’t know why HeyMax showing 0.4mpd only,btohqsg
Was it in-app paywave or paywave at physical terminal?,btohqsg
If $100k is mean a lot to you  I suggest you personally go n read the bank website to understand how it works. It is better than get the info from salesman or RM. it is not right to park your huge saving money without understand how it works  that may cause similar recent CF drama again.,btohqsg
heymax dun really track rewards accurately,btohqsg
Hello all  what card should i use to top up extra luggage for scoot on their app? (Is the mcc under travel or online spend?) is the citi rewards card or citi premire miles or chocolate card better for this purchase?,btohqsg

If anyone has input can help me please  am also open for investment as long as liquid  low risk please. Thank you so much 😊,btohqsg

Hello! Anyone tried to pay their dbs credit card payment with another dbs credit card to extend the bill payment amount by a month? Does the bank charge you any charges? I have seen this in online forum as a trick,btohqsg
The only major one is salary credit only by your company. Even the 500 spending is not a must,btohqsg
Don't think that's possible. If you can  then you effectively never pay for the bill!,btohqsg
