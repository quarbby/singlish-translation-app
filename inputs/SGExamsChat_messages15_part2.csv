But i feel my JC did provide adequate resources,btohqsg
That’s the problem  so fix it so that they do,btohqsg
Its not so easy to introduce change,btohqsg
If it was so easy it wont be a persistent issue,btohqsg
And even if one does it  no one will recognise ur efforts,btohqsg
Which is why some ppl run hagwons instead,btohqsg
Even if i were to introduce it,btohqsg
I will be a policy maker  not a teacher,btohqsg
That goes against what i want to do also,btohqsg
It kind of sucks that you can’t be both,btohqsg
Also there is parents mindsets cause many if not most parents are kiasu for their kid to do well or continue scoring As so send the kid to tuition,btohqsg
It’s the only thing stopping me from wanting to go to HQ,btohqsg
I straight up in front of parents say that if u are going for tuition for good grades and hope it does magic  u can stop aft this lesson,btohqsg
My parents never forced me to go to tuition,btohqsg
The parents are the main screwed up actors in the tuition issue,btohqsg
They just informed me one day in sec sch that i have tuition,btohqsg
I say that a student must rly have the interest and passion towards learning it,btohqsg
lowkey why ppl aim for elite schools so that they won’t feel the need to go for tuition cos the sch would provide the necessary resources,btohqsg
Yea they can always look for other tutors tho,btohqsg
but some can’t survive and go tuition as well,btohqsg
Mfw people go to elite schools and continue to go for tuition,btohqsg
My dad did that also esp for me but RI resources,btohqsg
Ri resources are trash in my honest opinion,btohqsg
Im more entertained in this convo,btohqsg
Honestly  streaming is a thing for a reason,btohqsg
i mean why do u think elite sch notes are so sought aftercos everyone is likeelite sch = btr notes,btohqsg
If your academic ability is at this level  you should be taught at this level,btohqsg
carousell is a v gd example,btohqsg
The best chem summary i found so far is made by 3 hci students,btohqsg
It even beats those tuition centre notes,btohqsg
Yea i didnt like the hoarde of elite sch resources given to me by my tutor dad it's not like i only have one subject to study,btohqsg
but ppl see it as a btr base of notes cos at the end of the day everyone wants to do as well as those in the elite schs what,btohqsg
Fr other schs use our notes and resources for lessons,btohqsg
Elite school notes are made for elite students,btohqsg
at the end of the day   we all js wna do well,btohqsg
Lol some ppl dont have eyes,btohqsg
Okay lah not too bad I only have one difficult student sec 5 and doesn't know what is 1-(1/2),btohqsg
I like students who rly ask a lot of qns,btohqsg
Rly makes me passionate in teaching,btohqsg
Yes but that doesn’t mean it makes sense to want to go to elite school just for notes and academic resources,btohqsg
cos im busy drawing in class,btohqsg
My teacher scolded me for asking too many ques during chem,btohqsg
But when u multiply a lot of qns by multiple students in a day.... LOL,btohqsg
The main advantage of elite schools is not notes and resources,btohqsg
well alot of ppl go cos of the resources tho,btohqsg
THEY R THE KING OF THE KING NOTES,btohqsg
Same thing as u but long ago,btohqsg
Chat with ya later at 2.40,btohqsg
i am sorry to all the tchrs who i slept in their class,btohqsg
What kind of elitism is this,btohqsg
