How does selection Ex work btw?,btohqsg
Hello guys  sorry noob here  I got Q number under mgps  may I know if there like certain units that are allocated to MGPS?Or is there like a priority selection for public first or mgps first,btohqsg
Based on the small sample size  seems like hard ah HAHAHA,btohqsg
Isnt MGPS like a specific type of flats?,btohqsg
Wait did i see a Q#7,btohqsg
Yeah I'm not sure like if there are only certain levels allocated to it or smth,btohqsg
There is a list of units for mgps,btohqsg
U only can choose from the list given,btohqsg
MGPS choose first then public queue,btohqsg
if got queue but exceed the unit,btohqsg
Haha yes I mean if she‚Äôs comparing mgps vs public,btohqsg
just use the magic number 20%,btohqsg
Thank you for your inputs! Really helps,btohqsg
hey anyone knows when or where can check the preselected units for mgps? or only on 1st appointment?,btohqsg
they'll send you the list when you receive your appt date,btohqsg
If my Q number is 1300 of 881. The chances is probably 0 right? ü§£,btohqsg
Hmm anyone knows when will we get the appt dates pls?,btohqsg
Does the different room tiers share the same queue no system? Like 3  4 and 5 room all in the same queue no? E.g. 3 room 2/100  4 room 3/100 or do they have separate one like 1/30  1/70 respectively,btohqsg
After seeing the unsuccessful reply for non matured Estate If i apply mature estate in Nov  will the failed chance for mroe ballot chance be reset to 0?,btohqsg
boon keng of Nov does not look appealing leh though there's a hawker center beside it,btohqsg
Yea. No plans in applying for nov  matured Estate then  since it will affect my 'failed chance'Can see expressway and ttsh though.,btohqsg
living next to expressway would have adverse effects on your health,btohqsg
Something new. Would it be the gases? Always felt having expressway view isn't that bad as compared to seeing other HDB flats,btohqsg
yes indeed I also wished that I staying beside Benjamin sheares bridge too,btohqsg
fumes and noises from the ongoing traffic,btohqsg
That would be at near  kallang stadium with the bridge view then.  Sadly  i feel noise (maybe not fume) is better than no view,btohqsg
we are the same want scenery view from our house,btohqsg
Yea to the extent even a view over the longkang with empty field  I don't mind,btohqsg
ok then wait for another 5 months,btohqsg
but I reckon it shouldn't be the one opposite old airport road hawker,btohqsg
Now at Cassia. Since blk 14 was closed in 2016. Or rather the whole estate was closed,btohqsg
Anyone here waiting fr flat at sky vista bukit batok,btohqsg

Anyone know when can apply for PHPS rental flat if we have a queue number but haven select flat,btohqsg

Hi  can I know how is the procedure like after gotten a success ballot in bto?,btohqsg
Thanks. If that day go down HDB to go thru calculations etc and if it turned out not able to purchase  will i have to wait out a year period? And then concurrently can I still apply for any openings of HDB flat?,btohqsg

Thank God u cant scalp queue numbers. Imagine the chaos,btohqsg
You‚Äôve got a very appropriate name üôä,btohqsg
Hi there.. may i know  if my Q number is 6## out of 880 unit total ¬† does tht consider i get a flat or possible i might not because of the EIP?,btohqsg
As we are a malay couple.. have any of u ever encounter anyone the Q number is slightly low but never get a flat,btohqsg
Should i be worried of EIP?,btohqsg
Will have chance to get a flat. But it will also depend on whether the area is popular for Malay. Most of the time  people tends to opt for high floor.,btohqsg
U think tampines will be full of malay?,btohqsg
I live near to the site at Tampines west. Quite nicely balanced out in terms of race,btohqsg
U just go apply for nov one..better.. we malay quota very hot like satay v fast finish..üòÇüëç,btohqsg
