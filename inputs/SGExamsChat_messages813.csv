3 corner fight the other party would lose their deposit,btohqsg
Then 2015 it is the boo guy,btohqsg
Yea but most 3 corner fights are when there is an independent person,btohqsg
Then 2020 she contesting the East Coast iirc,btohqsg
I hv not seen 3 parties fight tgt before,btohqsg
Not rlly u have PV the joke,btohqsg
2011 election is the most interesting man,btohqsg
You have the legend Yam Ah Mee,btohqsg
VOTE FOR METHE CROWD SHOUTSNOT YOU,btohqsg
Yam Ah Mee is the guy who actually goes and report the election results,btohqsg
Oh u mean the ELD guy ah,btohqsg
The way he presents the results even get remixed into some DJ thing,btohqsg
The pursuant to section 49  subsection 7E paragraph A is like brainwashing me,btohqsg
The votes counted are conclusive of the results.,btohqsg
Then after that presidents elections amongst the Tan,btohqsg
That's when you see Tan Kin Lian for the first time,btohqsg
We voted for the guy who pushed Buses as the only transport solution,btohqsg
In the end we have KFC instead,btohqsg
KFC said some pretty elitist stuff before according to Tay eng soon’s (some former minister of state who unfortunately died to a heart attack) wife,btohqsg
He actually has a Facebook following lol,btohqsg
Ong Teng Cheong was the best,btohqsg
He wasn't even given a state funeral,btohqsg
How did you come about knowing him?,btohqsg
He took private candidate before lmao in his NS,btohqsg
He took like 3 times come out worse,btohqsg
He did a Bedok in terms of Grades,btohqsg
You should see his gpa now,btohqsg
OOF ok i shall not talk about it any longer,btohqsg
He considers me a friend so,btohqsg
He writes better than he calculates,btohqsg
He had like 60 something RP if I remembered properly,btohqsg
Wait he took it 3 times and only managed a 60+?,btohqsg
Idk whether thats impressive or bad,btohqsg
YES LMAO he took H2 History for like 2 times by the time I came in learnt within 6 months got the same grade as him,btohqsg
Unfortunately I think his writing also cmi for University,btohqsg
Always waiting till the last min to do things,btohqsg
Chances are he probably waited till the day before H2 history paper and panicked lmao,btohqsg
His GP was even more subpar ngl,btohqsg
I feel like he just was like 1 week before GP he was like shit I have nothing of value to write and basically go onto straits times reading everything at that moment,btohqsg
Oh his GP was always the good one though,btohqsg
I think he got A in his last attempt,btohqsg
Yeah he did and he was very proud of that,btohqsg
Unfortunately H2s carry 20 RP each,btohqsg
He basically begrudgingly enter Physics and was bitching about it for months after,btohqsg
If anyone published research in JC before,btohqsg
Ehhh my options were limited by grades and physics was the more appealing out of all options,btohqsg
I mean I chose history cuz it was most appealing out of all options,btohqsg
I can get highest for 1 WA and then barely pass for another💀,btohqsg
she joined WP after leaving NSP,btohqsg
Maybe LTK go run for Tampines GRC,btohqsg
Goddam wtf 3$ mrt with ez link wallet,btohqsg
You are now Attacking!The teams have been auto-balanced,btohqsg
Another price guess lol  the soup is like half eaten alrdy tho,btohqsg
Something that i am not surprised about…PAP —> ElitistNo doubt about it,btohqsg
Then the more if wp comes on board and they choose to stay  they wun get their deposit back,btohqsg
I tot he retired fr mp?,btohqsg
I’m not sure about that but it’s that certain people there have an elitist attitude. Tay Eng Soon (then minister of state for education) definitely wasn’t elitist because he was the one pushing Tony Tan for more funding for vocational institutions  but his boss Tony Tan (then minister of education) straight up said that comment,btohqsg
Bruh why tf now the bus captain want me pay adult fare,btohqsg
Luckily i got pic of my ic lol,btohqsg
I got the face of wisdom,btohqsg
The driver asked me show my student card and i had to pull out a pic of my ic,btohqsg
because it is not part of the options,btohqsg
The education system has taught me to think outside the box🇸🇬,btohqsg
Ah yes SEAB and outside the box,btohqsg
Seab also taught me that memes are the best cure during o levels.,btohqsg
That also explains why r/NTU is just a meme farm,btohqsg
We are just high on copium,btohqsg
Stupid Siti from O levels Math paper giving me ptsd and anger issues,btohqsg
U talk about Olevel I still remember PSLE math trauma,btohqsg
After the paper half the cohort rushed down to weight a dollar coin,btohqsg
Fking dumbest question ever for SEAB,btohqsg
NEVER BE LIKE HMM I WONDER HOW MANY GRAMS IS DIS COIN,btohqsg
You know i still hate the subject based banding thing,btohqsg
The problem is I hate how they dealt with the bell curve,btohqsg
I just angry they force me into POA,btohqsg
Basically doomed me from the start,btohqsg
If u don't get B3 and above for Maths sec 2 in my school,btohqsg
Yea my school was rlly shit so we didnt rlly care that much about whether we end up in poa,btohqsg
We care more about whether we end up in food and consumer studies,btohqsg
Until I got F9 in POA,btohqsg
If u fucked up in FCE u got DNT,btohqsg
And u need A2 and above to get Pure Humanities,btohqsg
I always got C6 for Humanities,btohqsg
The irony of me being a humanities major is funny,btohqsg
We only had elect human and pure lit but cus pure lit cohort too small  end up dont have pure lit,btohqsg
Damn your school in da hood isit,btohqsg
And pure science students cannot take pure lit,btohqsg
Cus it was A Maths/POA/Pure Lit,btohqsg
I always got C6 or D7 for Humanities,btohqsg
I sometimes wonder how I ended up in Express stream when my languages were shit,btohqsg
Fortunately I was 199 so it was Exp/Normal,btohqsg
I am damn pissed I got told once before that to just stick to peel,btohqsg
Because I was writing in the form of an analysis,btohqsg
They just wanted like a recital,btohqsg
I swear I hated the humans except for lit,btohqsg
But lit cannot take for oure sci,btohqsg
We do not have an option for pure bio until the next cohort,btohqsg
Actually  we did not have pure or combined bio LOL,btohqsg
One of the reasons why I ain't teaching humanities in MOE,btohqsg
They make Humanities structured as if the human world is ever structured,btohqsg
All I know is they keep emphasising everything must be balanced,btohqsg
But cannot be over the fence,btohqsg
You need to state both agree and disagree,btohqsg
Yes writing that actually hitler was kinda good,btohqsg
Well to be fair  he wanted to go art school but got rejected,btohqsg
So it is the art school to be blamed,btohqsg
Hitler was a cunt Stalin was a cunt they are all cunts,btohqsg
It's the idea too that one is a bigger asshole than the other,btohqsg
The bomb on Nagasaki was justifiable... [1 mark  agree],btohqsg
Bruh why can't we just accept they both of em are assholes,btohqsg
What is dis highly charged infographic we cherry picked tryna say,btohqsg
All I rmb was during o levels one of my friend said they saw the source from the english mid term,btohqsg
They should just put a stop at 2 infographic and enjoy the carnage,btohqsg
I'm still waiting for the O level source based case study on Kpop.,btohqsg
They promised in the textbooks snsd.,btohqsg
I waiting for an infographic of the Big 3 of Kpop,btohqsg
And then be like is this justified,btohqsg
Then watch SM stans argue with JYP stans while Kakao hides in the background,btohqsg
I only know jyp for his goofy stuff,btohqsg
my teacher told me how the cohort or 2 cohorts before me had a topic of a Nigerian Flower Factory in the SS paper.That paper was lethal,btohqsg
I think I did that as tys once,btohqsg
talk to me about psle math trauma when you failed psle math,btohqsg
I didn't know it was possible to get below a C in any subject for PSLE.,btohqsg
broski i got E for psle math,btohqsg
The only reason why i cant enter express LMAO,btohqsg
Doesn't matter u in Uni now,btohqsg
But i fr now still cant do primary school math HAHAHHA,btohqsg
It ain't even concepts for primary school maths,btohqsg
Idk my brain is not moulded to answer any of those questions,btohqsg
was your other subs scores good,btohqsg
U know how to read a finanical statement or not?,btohqsg
I think it was like A B B E or some shit i dont remember,btohqsg
dang bro got more A than me,btohqsg
I came from a chinese primary school,btohqsg
Did u do any Commerce stream subjects later?,btohqsg
If i dont get A for chinese,btohqsg
Id have to cut my hands,btohqsg
I came from a school with a literal swastika,btohqsg
Nope never touched any poa or anything,btohqsg
Wah gg I fear for your finanical literacy bro,btohqsg
Maybe thats why i keep spending on concert tickets,btohqsg
I do too but like to a point whereby I can afford it,btohqsg
Or like loan money to afford it,btohqsg
my fav artist is never coming to sg,btohqsg
(he sadly likes that one painter),btohqsg
No because u end up going crazy and flying overseas for em,btohqsg
The good part about not having enough money,btohqsg
Is the inability to pull stunts like thaf,btohqsg
and then the concert turns out to be a listening party,btohqsg
Lanpa I fly to Bangkok + pay in THB for tickets cheaper,btohqsg
Only problem for anyone who has ever done that. If you see impact arena it's not BANGKOK FFS,btohqsg
Will also have the own set of scalpers,btohqsg
Not as bad as SG imo as the system is less friendly it's usually under ttm instead of our ticket master,btohqsg
I remember A levels math trauma,btohqsg
They ask u to estimate weight of a $1 coin?,btohqsg
PSLE maths question on $1 coins weighs heavy on parents' mindshttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/psle-maths-question-on-1-coins-weighs-heavy-on-parents-minds,btohqsg
The fact is psle math hv these sort of estimation qns that i dun get the purpose of it being tested,btohqsg
My sis is part of the ssb and it is damn stupid,btohqsg
What if u gang gang b3,btohqsg
I got C5 for my actual O lvl combine humans💀💀,btohqsg
Mmm not rlly  art was not common also  majority of them prefer dnt for some odd reason,btohqsg
I only got like B3.. or was it A2 idk,btohqsg
I wanted A1 so bad because everything that came out was within expectations,btohqsg
I got D7 or C6 nonstop for all my internal papers Olevel B3,btohqsg
I have no idea how I got B3 for history and ss,btohqsg
I think only ur T score + whether u pass matter in whether u get express or not,btohqsg
I was rmb getting near pass level,btohqsg
U need to hit I think above 200 for Tscore,btohqsg
Sometimes i wonder i shouldve gone to express,btohqsg
I was more surprised I got an A1 for both maths but apparently is common,btohqsg
Because sec school math is so much easier than whatever bs psle math is,btohqsg
I dont have to use my brain for sec school math,btohqsg
I remember if u affiliated 188 is still possible,btohqsg
But always for those schools got 1 class is the affiliated class which translates to the dumb fuck class,btohqsg
Got a tution teacher formerly from one say they are NA in all but name,btohqsg
was just go with the motion,btohqsg
I think 188 is the minimum for express,btohqsg
bro my fun fact about me during og bonding game is that i got 15/100 for my psle prelim math,btohqsg
I think it is 188  i rmb seeing a sch w express cut off 188,btohqsg
Some is lower I think lmao 🤣,btohqsg
My fun fact is I scored 199 lol,btohqsg
Forget liao but Bedok Greens express cutoff was just the cutoff for NA for some schools,btohqsg
And then some random 234 pointer came our sch,btohqsg
Used to be that Ping Yi was the lowest one for the east,btohqsg
I still cannot believe smb sec is still surviving,btohqsg
Like we are legit dwindling in numbers yall,btohqsg
I managed to DSA to a mid-tier,btohqsg
I dont understand how we havent merge with canberra yet,btohqsg
ok im not gonna answer any qns pertaining to that,btohqsg
My 2nd fun fact is i can wriggle my ears yall,btohqsg
clearly your doctor didnt do a very good job,btohqsg
I love how almost every day i hv sth unhappy about my parents,btohqsg
damn you're the man amongst men,btohqsg
i could pull out my class picture,btohqsg
At this point idk i gave up i let them be and suck it up,btohqsg
If i say anth  i gets shut off for 1m,btohqsg
Ain't gonna dox myself that much,btohqsg
At this point this chat is just exhibit 1 as evidence in our doxxing trial,btohqsg
Is amos yee still in jail?,btohqsg
Dun knock on wood later they deport him back,btohqsg
Speaking of which there was someone who scored 271 but accepted dsa into my sch so too late lo💀,btohqsg
sec school math is brain dead,btohqsg
quadratic formulas and expanding the brackets,btohqsg
I recalled ppl dsa into yijc,btohqsg
Cus everyone though cop become 16,btohqsg
The lowest it went was 19,btohqsg
-b +/- srt b²-4ac / 2a,btohqsg
Fun fact is in 2018 all the cop of the 4 merger went to the louser sch cop,btohqsg
I recall PJC was that pre merger.,btohqsg
sorry completing the square is the superior form,btohqsg
Forget liao. Also forgotten all the geometric rules,btohqsg
Holy shit i rly need see a doc  looked down for a moment and suddenly my vission was blurry,btohqsg
Pjc was going to be sub 10 school,btohqsg
cuz every year they will retain at least 20% of the j1cohort,btohqsg
Thhen the cut off point go up,btohqsg
Eh what's the retain rate for MI ah for PU1 to PU2 or PU3,btohqsg
Heard it is also 20% or smth stupid too,btohqsg
(0.5)^n where n is the number of years studied,btohqsg
I am no statistician but 0.5.. isn't that 50%,btohqsg
neither am i  i just came up with something,btohqsg
but yeah its something like that  maybe 30%?,btohqsg
But yall the only government one with MOB,btohqsg
that one you gotta talk to milo about it,btohqsg
but i heard its pretty much a free B/A,btohqsg
Yes I studied that the least during my private candidate times of my H2 subjects,btohqsg
Enter the exam come out with B,btohqsg
If u evaluate H2 subjects using the BCG matrix MOB is the cash cow@IcedMilo,btohqsg
How is MOB and POA in JC btw?,btohqsg
MOB is goated POA can suck a brick,btohqsg
Like what is the premise of H2 MOB?,btohqsg
Like we what is MOB about?,btohqsg
its an MI exclusive h2 subject,btohqsg
U get to actually understand what is in a financial statement la which is quite important for u ah,btohqsg
i dont think it'll be terribly hard to understand,btohqsg
It's basically ratios and stuff and u gotta evaluate what the ratios mean about the company,btohqsg
Guys should I drop history to h1,btohqsg
u do know i was from mi,btohqsg
so wats the point of doing it,btohqsg
not as a separate case study,btohqsg
i didnt study for afc tbh,btohqsg
AFC was never a case study it was an essay thing,btohqsg
but it was just cut out,btohqsg
idk how say but it's not as impt in the syllabus,btohqsg
then did they replace with smth else,btohqsg
cause none of my seniors took h2 hist,btohqsg
yeah it rlly is too mixed,btohqsg
It was always just left as an essay question,btohqsg
my batch first batch of new syllabus,btohqsg
so wats the diff with h1,btohqsg
history is actl the h2 subj I spend the least time on,btohqsg
wait wat yr are u in lol,btohqsg
u took ur a’s last yr ah,btohqsg
I'm doing a level in 2025,btohqsg
Wah meanwhile all the hist ppl ik are now hist haters,btohqsg
Ok but I shld legit sleep,btohqsg
getting scolded left right centre to sleep sia fuck,btohqsg
Wait why you need sleep again uh?,btohqsg
If u suck at economic concepts H2 Hist not fun,btohqsg
i might take it as a minor,btohqsg
it was actly p fun when u come to love it,btohqsg
I might take it as a major,btohqsg
I mean... it is ok in uni,btohqsg
now who tf is talking o lvls,btohqsg
I took PCMe but honestly I wanna take PCMl,btohqsg
Ngl I would've taken h1 lit if my sch offer,btohqsg
Olevels is like an idealised version of history. It's like a history syllabus that can be condensed into a oversimplified video,btohqsg
Pu1: at least 2 classes worth will retain  but some will drop outPu2: idk but mainly brcause of pw,btohqsg
Cannot do that for H2 History ngl,btohqsg
js take it that every yr half yr batch retains/drops out,btohqsg
and the final yr only 1/3 can make it to uni,btohqsg
but luxkily i didnt retain lah,btohqsg
But defo more than 2 classes,btohqsg
Depends part of that 2/3 parents rich or in denial then go to private uni or overseas uni,btohqsg
1/3 inclusive rich stupid ppl who js jets themselves off to australia/sim,btohqsg
but u managed to get into uni right,btohqsg
when it came the pages were missing,btohqsg
It's a gawd damn ponzi scheme,btohqsg
Uni is where we learn about e120 chemical,btohqsg
ik there are other mi kids also la but,btohqsg
not to say nus is too big to see them,btohqsg
that theres barely anyone who sctly ended up in nus,btohqsg
More like it's where u get a hands on lesson on the human organ system,btohqsg
and thise that made it to nus,btohqsg
Yah and science experiment in tbr staircase,btohqsg
quite the lot ended up in lower “tier” programmes,btohqsg
those with lower cut off point ah,btohqsg
That's JC for uni you have halls.,btohqsg
oh so ur hall is krsheares,btohqsg
hello got hall why need staircase😩😩😩😩,btohqsg
Idk why he so obsessed with public areas,btohqsg
U got a fetish for public showings isit,btohqsg
He would be perfect for NUS,btohqsg
nus is grades + high profile,btohqsg
which i find is fking wasted,btohqsg
No he blurs the public private distinction,btohqsg
cuz mi don’t inculcate a strong profile,btohqsg
I low profile so nus is gg,btohqsg
become like the mother of the twins,btohqsg
i want to do math related,btohqsg
cuz i see a trend on my maths results for my national exams,btohqsg
yk uni math not math hor,btohqsg
haha but i need go thru ns,btohqsg
My ori I ended up watching movies,btohqsg
U only ogl for faculty? Not hall?,btohqsg
I condense it simply for you.SEAB no need logic for Maths oneUni Maths u need logic.,btohqsg
The Proof that 1+1 = 2 is like 800 pages long,btohqsg
wait which yr did u grad,btohqsg
huh when i was year 1,btohqsg
4 yrs in mi for a good degree cert,btohqsg
enter nus same age as the boys,btohqsg
those 4-5 yrs in mi end up still fail a lvls,btohqsg
quire sad also ah waste ur yrs,btohqsg
ik someone retain 5 yrs + retook a lvls,btohqsg
and was faced with a dilemma,btohqsg
but when i see the new gp sylabbus,btohqsg
my math foundations weak at yr 1,btohqsg
i can build back up well,btohqsg
Idw to do 3 ple passage paper,btohqsg
me going thru passages every single day now:,btohqsg
didnt i go back to sch for a mini talk once,btohqsg
will u join politics in the future,btohqsg
oh maybe that time i went for my commando,btohqsg
I thought lestin went back for the talk,btohqsg
where he share a lot about ntu life,btohqsg
idk why the alumni grp of ppl keep approaching sim etc students,btohqsg
they have resources like me iestin milo,btohqsg
I think they fkrgot u guys,btohqsg
u ask me abt hall rc anyth i also can ans u quite abunch,btohqsg
exclusive to a certain grp of ppl,btohqsg
but thats cuz of my financial situation,btohqsg
and occasional awards for topping classes,btohqsg
u top one class u get $300+ eh sometimes,btohqsg
i js chill in. the room edit things,btohqsg
one day get alot of money,btohqsg
then they open listing to everyone,btohqsg
i got some friends who teaxh also,btohqsg
i might teach next sem/sem 2,btohqsg
Wah paid like officr workers eh,btohqsg
Yeah my sis got teach b4,btohqsg
idk if they have ta avaialbilities,btohqsg
but i looking st the other mods i took also,btohqsg
must score well for the mod also,btohqsg
but that was a few years ago,btohqsg
idk if iw to go into moe…,btohqsg
is like any qn u go to them ah,btohqsg
ur classes are taught by ur ta,btohqsg
usually no one talks to lecturer,btohqsg
Also depends on ur mods tho,btohqsg
some of my mods damn small,btohqsg
prof also can teach one class,btohqsg
then ta teach the other class,btohqsg
Oh so ta teach smaller class,btohqsg
but i odnt think im furthering it,btohqsg
i js want to focus on religious extremism,btohqsg
oh like the rohingya thing in myanmar,btohqsg
integrate is a nicer word la,btohqsg
"i differentiate with respect to ""a nicer world lah""",btohqsg
muslim countries is a whole other,btohqsg
wah i tell u very scary its full of violence in the arab world,btohqsg
"imagine ur american  free society right  someone from arab world go into your country and say ""I want the sharia law to be imposed in this country"" i tell u gg💀",btohqsg
i have alot to say abt all sorts of political systems but,btohqsg
Slovenia 1 - 1 Denmark 💀,btohqsg
Imagine ivanka trump running for pres in 2028,btohqsg
also why these ppl are favoured is because they were taught by thhe hods/ year heads,btohqsg
who is in charge of the alumni grp,btohqsg
i tend to forget mi existed thanks to how dead it is,btohqsg
ig time for u to find out,btohqsg
yeah every year the cohort dwindled,btohqsg
practically no need for it to exist when it doesnt realistically bring results either,btohqsg
Nah i still believe there is a place for MI in sg,btohqsg
And i dont believe itll perish,btohqsg
some idea abt pushing all jc from 2 to 3 yrs,btohqsg
Nah i dont think itll come into fruition,btohqsg
Jc will always be 2 years,btohqsg
2 yr kids are dying tho,btohqsg
and then reducing primary school from 6 to 5 years,btohqsg
Imagine what the implication would be for people who join an IP school via DSA or JAE? It wasn’t too long ago that DHS and RV were made to accept students via JAE. The goal is to ensure multiple pathways of success and advancement in education paths  not create barriers,btohqsg
MJC retain rate was also quite high until this stopped during the merger,btohqsg
Yea but the sch leaders change,btohqsg
And also w the merger they prolly dun want retain too many j1,btohqsg
So probably just push to J2 and get shit RP,btohqsg
Maybe that is why our avg drop,btohqsg
