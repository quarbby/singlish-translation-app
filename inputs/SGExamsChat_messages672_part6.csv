+ need go school 7am 2x a week,btohqsg
I suggest u look at 10th and 90th percentile uas and take that into acct ah,btohqsg
But like for the same rp,btohqsg
Do they pick ppl who choose it as first choice than last choice,btohqsg
It depends on whether u are qualified for ur above choices. And if u are at the 10th percentile  they will call u for interview,btohqsg
feel like most of them have a beefier portfolio or smth,btohqsg
I think smu and the smaller uni like sit interviews everyone,btohqsg
When did they start giving this,btohqsg
My batch have no graduation gift sia,btohqsg
my vj friend cant stop talking abt how badly his sch did for last yrs o's,btohqsg
Speaking of which  they gave us mjc mascot key chain before merger then now i cant find it:-(,btohqsg
he call his jc mid tier sia,btohqsg
He alr in jc bro like,btohqsg
How high he want to go,btohqsg
@chemcerwhat tier is bmtc sch 5,btohqsg
aren't all the jc the same,btohqsg
man i rly want buy a proper office chair,btohqsg
my ass barely can tahan my wooden dining table one,btohqsg
Some schs will defo give U btr networking opps than others,btohqsg
It's stupid to try to deny that,btohqsg
apprently. lower cop higher tier jc,btohqsg
Otherwise the opportunities are pretty much the same,btohqsg
wat about portfolio/chances to do stuff outside of the curriculum?,btohqsg
But some prolly more than others also,btohqsg
In 1 week there's like 8-10 U can sign up alr,btohqsg
Honestly it's rly up to u to choose one,btohqsg
maybe less of a discrepency in jc but can definitely feel it in my chapalang sec sch,btohqsg
But like must manage time properly la ukuk,btohqsg
Ig in sec school it makes sense lah so many sec school,btohqsg
2 sec schools can be beside each other and one is good one is rabak,btohqsg
wonder if merging sec schs wld be sensible hmm,btohqsg
But the intake rn is by the same,btohqsg
is intake why jcs are being merged?,btohqsg
I think campus cannot manage 2 sec schools tgt,btohqsg
Some sec schs also kena merged la,btohqsg
Also cos more ppl choosing poly,btohqsg
I feel like we won't see any more JC mergers lah everything is nc alr,btohqsg
still got the stigma tho rip,btohqsg
I think they may js ask the IP schools to have jip,btohqsg
Like instead of DHS go DHS,btohqsg
I think it's pretty much gone alr for younger gen,btohqsg
Even parents now don't mind that much,btohqsg
I mean it depends on parents ah,btohqsg
Like for me I didn't mind going poly,btohqsg
They were my 3rd choice onwards,btohqsg
SP and I think NP both offered AP Chem diploma which I liked so they were my 3rd and 4th choice,btohqsg
cus my mom moved here from china,btohqsg
Ya same but right I rly rly praying hard to get to jc,btohqsg
