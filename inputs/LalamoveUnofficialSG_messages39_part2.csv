Swiped at 8.35 he ask me to reach jw by 9pm with a je drop.first,btohqsg
I told him i cant do it  please find another driver,btohqsg
I have a joker took a photo of me while i deliver to him,btohqsg
Nowadays damn stress give u these type of timeline to complete jobs,btohqsg
I had this worry too last week. Seems like as long as u start the job and complete within the mission hrs it is considered x1. So if mission time is 10am to 2pm make sure u dont load before 10am and dont drop after 2pm. It shld count as x1,btohqsg
I cheated a bit last week by those near end mission timing 8pm jobs 7.59pm i swipe complete drop off although i am still like 5 mins out. Those were counted in.,btohqsg
I was near enough not to have app prompt that i am not near location.,btohqsg
Must be customer kena cheated by the delivery guy before,btohqsg
Take photos is normal I encountered before for food & non food products. I completed & ask the sender for payment until next day than transfer lol,btohqsg
Give 1 star & block this joker. Who the hell he think he is?! What I observe not all but most people look down on people doing delivery job for some reason.,btohqsg
Yes i agree.. Some ppl still live in their own shallow society...,btohqsg
