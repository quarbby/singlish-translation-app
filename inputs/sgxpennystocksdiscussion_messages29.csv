Anyone using DBS Vickers? Want to ask  when u sell shares (contra or without contra)  does DBS n SGX send sms to u?,btohqsg
Buyback the shares go back to treasury shares... shares outstanding reduce...EPS go up n PE ratio go down.  Dividend payout might improve...Company don't sell shares... the company staff aka management or director sells,btohqsg

This week BB goreng MT and VP,btohqsg
wonder ix biopharma got chance to move soon?,btohqsg
Why  u missed the ride? Since morning only talk down statements from you üòÖ,btohqsg
Pros:-TG feel the current share price is undervalued & worth to buy back.-BB won‚Äôt dare to short TG as a strong party is ready to snap up the shares at an even lower price if available.Cons:-BB in turn may not involve much in TG as they can‚Äôt manipulate much. Indirectly the price will rise because of more investors who buy TG shares if they believe in TG prospect.,btohqsg
To add on  TG probably got something good cooking within. That‚Äôs why they buy back the shares.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm Looking forward then. Coz I challenge the BB to short it. üòõ,btohqsg
They churn it up  I happy.They short it down  I also happy to get more shares at low price.,btohqsg
Now the price like playing around 255-270,btohqsg

For me  I look to trade some and will hold half for longer term.I prefer to look one hurdle at a time. First is for it to test $0.081/$0.082  and clear convincingly then believe it should be able to test year High $0.090.From there then see price action and market sentiments to determine.If don‚Äôt feel good then will cut or take profit too.,btohqsg

THE executive chairman of Hanwell Holdings and Tat Seng Packaging Group was made bankrupt in August  but these two Singapore-listed companies have to date not acted on Allan Yap's directorship even though the law prohibits a bankrupt from being director.Mr Yap was declared bankrupt after the court in Hong Kong granted a bankruptcy petition by creditors over debts of more than HK$685 million (S$121 million) arising out of personal guarantees given by the 64-year-old in respect of the liabilities of Hong Kong-listed Master Glory Group.This has led to Master Glory announcing in a notice to the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong about the disqualification of Mr Yap as executive chairman following his bankruptcy with effect from Aug 3.Master Glory  formerly Hanny Holdings  is an investment holding company principally engaged in security  property and water supply businesses  but it is now in liquidation.Mr Yap's position as executive chairman at Hanwell and its 64-per-cent-owned subsidiary Tat Seng does not seem to have been affected by his bankrupt status  however.No announcements have been made to the Singapore Exchange by either of the two companies  despite Singapore's Companies Act stipulating that an undischarged bankrupt is disqualified to be director.Tat Seng said it will look into it and would probably follow up with an announcement today  when approached by The Business Times.Hanwell  however  has not responded to BT queries.Mr Yap had  in fact  announced the financial results of Hanwell in the capacity of chairman on Aug 13  after the Hong Kong court had adjudged him to be a bankrupt. He was re-elected to the board of Hanwell in June while his first appointment was in 2002.Hanwell  used to be known as Provisions Suppliers Corporation  is a manufacturer and distributor of a variety of well-known brands of consumer products including Royal Umbrella rice  Beautex tissue paper and Fortune tofu.Its net profit for the half year to June 30 more than doubled to S$9.9 million  buoyed by good performance from rice  cooking oil and tofu  though revenue was marginally lower at S$215.8 million.Over at Tat Seng  Mr Yap was re-elected to the board in June as well. According to the company's website  the executive chairman has over 30 years of experience in finance  investment and banking.Mr Yap is the spouse of Tang Cheuk Chee  executive director of both Hanwell and Tat Seng.According to the Companies Act  except with the approval of the court or the written permission of the official assignee who administers a bankrupt's financial affairs  a bankrupt faces a maximum fine of S$10 000  a jail term of up to two years or both if he acts as director  regardless of where the bankruptcy order is made.BT has reached out to the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority for comments.,btohqsg
