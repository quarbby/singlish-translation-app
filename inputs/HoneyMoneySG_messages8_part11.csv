Hello broYou the owner of this telegram group?,btohqsg
Sorry in advance if this isnt allowed. Please delete if its inappropriate.1) For those who are poor like me and unable to get credit card  you can used standard chartered jumpstart card. I have tried it and it work i get my 1 percent cash back. So far got 7 dollars.2) this might result your account in getting banI realize that instarem can be used to top up your grab a while back. So i tried this  not sure if its against tos or not. But i tried to do it and i was able to withdraw the money out of ezlink card and put it on grab to earn twice as much point.Update i think amaze ban me because i do that. I am able to do it to ezlink master card tho.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Anyone else tried this?,btohqsg
Another alternative to the standard charter jumpstart card that i have would be the safra card so far i havent tried it yet. Will update once tried,btohqsg
Wouldnt recommend part 2 tho because its against the security policy,btohqsg
Paiseh forgot to add that that one is a substitute for the method where you use grab to top up jipay to top up the ezlink card,btohqsg
Since i do not have the credit card this is the next best thing,btohqsg

Or any other better methods u guy will recommend?,btohqsg
Does anyone know if the UOB absolute card fixed deposit collateral earns interest? And for CC in general if I have to post a collateral does it usually earn interest?,btohqsg

Btw revolut card is considered credit card?,btohqsg

Hi anyone recently signed up for jipay? Have this popup upon signing up and dont have a spender to add as I'm using it for myself. Any idea how to ensure they issue out my first card?,btohqsg
Just make a top up  like what it said,btohqsg
I also initially thought so but the wordings are unclear. So I asked jipay which seem to state that both spender and top-up must be done before card issuance,btohqsg
In short just top up $25 and wait for a week.,btohqsg
Hi  just wanted to clarify. Signing up for a credit card if I have an existing debit card with the bank will still allow me to be eligible for the credit card promos yes?,btohqsg
What kind of promo and whic credit card? Only citibank has rewards for existing customers for now,btohqsg
Sorry  didn't make myself clear. Currently holding UOB debit card. So intending to sign up for a UOB credit card. I know that promos are usually for new to bank sign ups. Debit cards don't count against that right?,btohqsg
Correct. Still a new user if you're just holding debit card with no credit card before,btohqsg
Uob promotion didn‚Äôt mentioned for ppv card if they received 12000 miles only mentioned $150 cash. Anyone has any information to that?,btohqsg
Alright  thanks for the clarification Chris!,btohqsg
I saw regarding the cards promotion. According to the T&C  would assume KF CC would be eligible for both miles and cash credit?,btohqsg
