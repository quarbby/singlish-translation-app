the rule of 7 is its creepy if the guys age / 2 + 7 is still lower than the older person,btohqsg

Cos they cannot pull anyone their age,btohqsg

The most visited place around there can see is the medical centre  situated at the heart of this luxurious island resort on Ladang Street. The centre boasts amenities such as Medical Centificates and Excuse sheets providing a valuable commodity for the common NSman all at the expense of the poor Medical Officer  exiled to this island all for the purposes of serving his homeland and for a cheaper university bill.,btohqsg
Tomato Tomato I am sure there are proper terms for a wide variety of relevant circumstances but I haven't got the foggiest of clue or interest in discussing the differences between such terminology,btohqsg

Oh right  that station has the same layout as JE,btohqsg
Hey can I have some too?,btohqsg
Jurong had a 3 track layout as the middle platform was actually used more like how the changi airport line was used (North South line back then only extended till like Choa Chu Kang  only later did they extend all the way till Yio Chu Kang),btohqsg
however Ang Mo Kio doesn't have the middle track for another line but rather for withdrawal trains (trains enter that platform to complete their service before heading back to the depot  a separate track was created so withdrawing trains do not interfere with the other trains on service,btohqsg
Who used to be some General in the Military,btohqsg
Can also be the chairman of ECDA as well,btohqsg
ello SG folks wanna ask  can trace a mobile phone number linked to a person ah?,btohqsg

no idea SG has this feature.,btohqsg
that will identify the owner of the phone number.,btohqsg
errrr like u pretend transfer money to the person  before u transfer can see the name,btohqsg

Quote of the day ‚Äúleaving is more powerful than staying  that is why the airport see more kisses than the wedding halls and the hospital see more prayers than worship‚Äù,btohqsg

throttling  turbine and like nozzle are they steady state systems or open systems,btohqsg
cos my sch notes is like 1 say steady state the other is open,btohqsg
do you know what those terms mean?,btohqsg
steady state is mass enter and leave at the same flow rate,btohqsg
there is constant mass where mass in = mass out,btohqsg
both energy and mass can flow in and out,btohqsg
for those 3 processes by rite it should be steady state cos they all use the continuity equation,btohqsg
so just from that  open systems can be steady state and non steady state,btohqsg
steady state just requires this specific condition,btohqsg
The turnitin last time increased my score because of my links to my references,btohqsg
Dude is having the time of his life with that bottle,btohqsg
MY PET SNAILS ARE NOT FOR EATING,btohqsg

oh thanks you live at block 1?,btohqsg
Look it up on google you will know,btohqsg
thanks for the ‚Äújust google‚Äù advicedont worry i definitely willnotgoogle it,btohqsg
I mean it‚Äôs a hdb set aside for Low income rental,btohqsg
That explains a lot of it,btohqsg
how tf do u even get involved in NDP,btohqsg
It‚Äôs hdb with two room units,btohqsg
Yea I delivered hampers on behalf of my school there,btohqsg
stfu dog you‚Äôre the bigger boomer here,btohqsg
You know how rentals are like right?,btohqsg
Rentals hdb always end on the news,btohqsg
i mean for a start with block 1,btohqsg
I was abt to send my whole feed,btohqsg
and they also end with payments,btohqsg
they are known to be in bad condition  the ppl that rent them usually dont take care of their unit,btohqsg
U get chosen just like everything in MINDEF,btohqsg
Wonder if singapore still has 1 room HDBs for rent tho,btohqsg
why does this have similar destructions to the buildings in ukraine that are being bombed,btohqsg
alot of it is just superficial damage,btohqsg
the walls everything are still structually intact,btohqsg
this is a 1 room folks,btohqsg
The light from a single window,btohqsg
sleep on the floor? aight bet,btohqsg
and the bathroom? just shower with the kitchen sink?,btohqsg
there is a attached toilet in the kitchen,btohqsg
There's a bathroom lol it's just at the side,btohqsg
usually these units are only for relocated elderlies,btohqsg
Isn't it for low income ppl too?,btohqsg
oh right i didnt see it,btohqsg
I think it's unlikely given that HDBs are just full on concrete,btohqsg
my bad my eyes are impaired,btohqsg
should we be worried when these are how some of our hdb's are built?,btohqsg
how tf are you finding all of these,btohqsg
If u look at the piece falling off u can see those are non load bearing,btohqsg
ok that reminds me of the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks bruh,btohqsg
the best part is how the taxi that reversed into it looks,btohqsg
bros going to tell me that it's true boredom again,btohqsg
honestly if I'm that bored i still won't be able to find these things,btohqsg
maybe ryans humor is actually just something else,btohqsg
i dont even see much damage honestly on the taxi,btohqsg
Yeah cuz the hdb also not much damage,btohqsg
there's no way its in service,btohqsg
Fun fact: Some burned out public busses were rebodied and were given new leases on life,btohqsg
The wheels on the bus go round and round,btohqsg
üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ üëÄ,btohqsg
part of C751B 319/320 (think Car 3320) was repurposed for ITE i think,btohqsg
C151 095/095 (3095-1095) was repurposed for 3rd rail (yes for whose who didn't know they used a real train  infact you've probably already went on this boi before üëÄ,btohqsg
I think the airplane was also taken out of a salvage yard,btohqsg
The first K230UB scrapped happened in 2016,btohqsg
^electrical fault too expensive to repair,btohqsg
if you mean TENET then probably yes üëÄ,btohqsg
Oh yea  btw LTA is planning to replace this bus model by 2027,btohqsg
talking abt electric faulti remember there was a bus that was retrofitted with electric motors and batteries,btohqsg
well not any different from KNS KHI SIE ü•≤,btohqsg
The new double decker idk if it's just me la but the leg room is non existent sia,btohqsg
i don't remember bus models well üò≠,btohqsg
I want the bus with 3 exits,btohqsg
slightly but i dont take pics of busses,btohqsg
Man A95 Euro 6 3 door version i think,btohqsg
Yeah.. I have no idea as to buses I am more of a plane person,btohqsg
but i guess you could say i keep up with bus news more than the average singaporean,btohqsg
im a plane person 2 :D,btohqsg
Omg ryan remember when you were ‚Äòxmmlovesbuses‚Äô,btohqsg
What's your favourite model and make?,btohqsg
omg ‚Ä¶ times have changed !,btohqsg
Did you know some of our old SBS busses went to thailand to serve as commuter busses?,btohqsg
omg...really? nah my discord user is still that,btohqsg
I do know that because I am also an avid investor as sell,btohqsg
nice  but the fact some of the bus enthu can decipher the exact busses that was converted in bangkok is the mind blowing part,btohqsg
i don't know that but i know that some of the tokyo metro 05 series have been repurposed and sent to indonesia for service üëÄ,btohqsg
Like someone found out  these two were the same busses,btohqsg
so you can re live Singapore's oldest generation of train in indonesia :D,btohqsg
just have to ensure you find the GTO chopper version,btohqsg
i did a bit of research and found out some of our old public busses made it to other parts of the world as well,btohqsg
none of our trains did though üòî,btohqsg
like this  went to south africa,btohqsg
There also another interesting fact for such public transport,btohqsg
So an off tangent la but the trains used in the Pyeongyang Metro were trains originally on the German Transit,btohqsg
^i see vids of pyeongyang and i see a bunch of old german vehicles,btohqsg
Yeah it's mainly the Type D trains,btohqsg
Till this day that building is still not complete,btohqsg
technically can be doing this + other stuff,btohqsg
Don't think so the wording to me seems to me like it's a full time kinda programme,btohqsg
Ok the history of thay building is actually pretty interesting I believe it started building in the Kim Jong il times in the 1990s but ran out of money when the soviet Union collapsed.. it then laid half built for like 15 years until 2011 when the outside was completed but till today in interior is not build fully,btohqsg
yeah  that's why I said empty shell  hahaha.I remember saw a youtube documentary commenting about that.,btohqsg
Probably the age old vice documentary of North Korea,btohqsg
Damn I miss the old vice :(,btohqsg
Watching the Special Forces tekan in real life hits diff,btohqsg
Yeah that would defeat the purpose of it ngl cuz I really found the open University concept more interesting,btohqsg
How much cocaine does one have to do to juggle both?,btohqsg
Except its gonna be in different campuses cuz I don't think u can enroll in SUTD as a student in another program,btohqsg
158 is rly 79*2 too many sigh,btohqsg
He got the NUS pass so no choice.,btohqsg
Isn't it a legal requirement to report it even if not explicitly allowed to?,btohqsg
Depends on Faculty tho but I think now it's kinda strict in terms of NUS stance on such cases,btohqsg
Given the jokes we students always make about NUS and Voyeurism,btohqsg
Yeah it's a crime and it might be legally mandated,btohqsg
Bro it ain't even MOE liao it's with SPF and MHA,btohqsg
im going to hell for this  iykyk,btohqsg
vice did two videos on it,btohqsg
Some PE got a massive bollocking for that incident,btohqsg
"It might not be appropriate but my dad always said when driving""Bang got sound one.""",btohqsg
Eh bedok join the cat convo bro,btohqsg
He still got like 1.5 more years,btohqsg
What‚Äôs as big as a house  burns 20 litres of fuel every hour  puts out a shitload of smoke and noise  and cuts an apple into three pieces? A Soviet machine made to cut apples into four pieces!,btohqsg
Na the concorde is bae with its steep angle of attack,btohqsg
I mean the 737 is the most common one I think but the 757 in its class is outperformed by the 777 and 787,btohqsg
Has the 757 been phased out yet?,btohqsg
But as far as I know,btohqsg
If it isn't designed as such then no also it might run issues with grant as I think the wording also kinda implies its for those of a lower income bracket.,btohqsg
Ahh the recent one used for transport of Biden to Ukraine?,btohqsg
You nid to know it is otot 40 hrs a week,btohqsg
And ft uni is 40+ hrs aso,btohqsg
Meanwhile singapore be like Singapore Airlines take it or leave it,btohqsg
And the quiz is stupid asf,btohqsg
A double degree is usually a different intake for 1 reason. It takes effort on the part of Student Affairs to managed your timetable,btohqsg
If it isn't on the list as a double degree program then it ain't supposed to be a double degree,btohqsg
I love a plane that calls you a retard when u land,btohqsg
eh I swear this cng making me think kuro talking to himself,btohqsg
Who knows maybe both is his alt,btohqsg
But u nid to know u nid to even pass through the dip first,btohqsg
Which is ard 1.5 yrs of content,btohqsg
Huh? So it's like Open University la,btohqsg
Just with it being free and more strict in admissions,btohqsg
Yeah with that phrasing it really makes me think those spots will be reserved in large proportions for low income ppl,btohqsg
Hahahaha that would explain why its free.. kena stuck with fdpanda for like 5 years,btohqsg
anyone want to save my TikTok feed it‚Äôs full of plane thirst traps,btohqsg
I got one from reddit recently,btohqsg
I love taking them if I know the plane model,btohqsg

I never said u didn't I just said u what u said which is that u don't fly budget,btohqsg
Or try not to do so which was what u said,btohqsg
And I try to fly budget cuz I prefer to spend the money on my holiday destination instead,btohqsg
Same unless it's the same price which it never is.,btohqsg
In that case btw u can just mail back your excess,btohqsg
eh wait before that  hello I do not want to know how a stall feels like neither have I felt so I wouldn‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm in a stall and when it‚Äôs js turbulence and plane js dropped for no reason thank you,btohqsg
