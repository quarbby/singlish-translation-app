Hello everyone  just wanna ask how long does hfe takes to get approved these days? My current hfe will expire on 3 Jan  when is a good time to renew?,btohqsg
Usually they only allow renewal within the week of expiry,btohqsg
I see thanks. So I can't renew earlier like 1 month before?,btohqsg
I don't think so... But you can write into them to ask when you can renew it  they might have changed the rules.,btohqsg
How fast is it to renew please?,btohqsg
Hi all  please remember no advertisements! Your message will be deleted and you will be banned from the chat,btohqsg
Hello! Would like to check whether a Credit Bureau report is required for HFE letter application?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not. Is the credit bureau report only required for those that are self-employed?,btohqsg
Usually it's for them. I pm you,btohqsg
Only when requested. My husband no need to produce any. I'm self employed and hdb specially requested for me to further upload this. Anyway  just pay around 8 bucks and get it very fast.,btohqsg
hi all  would like to ask  after i've book a flat & paid the 2k  am i still allowed to change jobs?,btohqsg
Yes you can. They will reassess your income only nearing key collection  for locking in the loan amt,btohqsg
Is there a case of the loan amount being insufficient for the flat booked during sales launch couple years back due to job changes? What happens then?,btohqsg
Yes  it's possible. In any case where your loan + grants (if any) dont cover the full cost of the flat  need to pay the balance in full at key collection,btohqsg
Pay the balance in cashAnyway  should aim for same or higher income when changing jobsIf income becomes lower during reassessment when nearer key collection  the loan amount allowed will also be lesser,btohqsg
hello... amyone know where is the link for Alkaff breeze?,btohqsg
Hello all  I know of people who applied for the Oct BTO after the application closed because HDB fucked up and approved HFE late. So is it safe to say that the application rates we see on the website is not accurate? Did anyone call HDB to clarify this?,btohqsg
hdb has not updated the status of toh guan bto whether they have found a new contractor or not,btohqsg
HDB delayed in approving their HFE for Oct BTO application. So a few days after Oct BTO closed  HDB called applicants to say their HFE is finally approved and asked them to apply for the Oct BTO even tho publicly is closed,btohqsg
But how many are these out of the total number of ppl who applied ? Is it even 1%?,btohqsg
lol idk but it affects the odds nonetheless? i wouldnt be ok to give up even 1 position in my queue  if that's what you're asking,btohqsg
Recommended to apply for HFE by 11 November '23 for the December launch (if required)...,btohqsg
Whether people will follow is another thing,btohqsg
Not everyone following HDB or your Tele mah üòù,btohqsg
May I know if anyone has updates on Yishun Grove Spring progress?,btohqsg
Any group chat for Tampines greenglade?,btohqsg
Do we usually re-apply HFE approximately 6 months in advance before key collection?Other than that  what else are we required to complete before key collection?,btohqsg
Both!Kiasoo sporeanI even joined groups of projects which i didn't apply BTO in... ü´¢,btohqsg
Yah  quite a major project overall  so more people  more estatesCan probably see more home ideas  products and stuff,btohqsg
When is your estimated key collection?For HLE  HBD will contact applicant for review / renewal when nearer key collectionShould be similar for HFE,btohqsg
The procurement exercise is supposedly during this month... Hopefully HDB will update soonYou applied for Toh Guan Grove?,btohqsg
yes. i had requested them for an update via the feedback form.,btohqsg
Oh coolAnd hallo  neighbour!My project is a few streets away from you guysüòÖ,btohqsg
Yeah during my application it was HLE I think,btohqsg
hi! i've always wondered why ur project is much cheaper than toh guan grove when the proximity is so close,btohqsg
Yeah  i think yours should be HLEHFE started May this year (if i don't remember wrongly)Unless you applied through SBF where waiting time can be much shorter,btohqsg
Yeah  same question came up in our Tele group... But i have no complaints ü§≠You guys seem much nearer the upcoming train station though,btohqsg
Alright  thanks! So I guess I should just wait for notification from HDB nearer to date before re-applying for HLE?,btohqsg
From what i understand  it is not new application (re-apply) per seMore of review or reassessmentBut yes  HDB will contact youOne thing that i heard from a few people from other groups though - they were told that they had to top up cash only few days before key collection üò∂üò∂Not sure what happened exactly (i didn't ask)In case this is a concern for you  you might try to check with HDB when they notify you about the HLE renewal,btohqsg
Any update on Woodlands Champions Green bto?,btohqsg
Hi  I'm looking at the next launch  when would estimated floor plan be released?,btohqsg
Hi WJ  the floor plan is published as the same time as the launch,btohqsg
Hello Any tele group for updates of Hougang Olive üòâ,btohqsg
Perfect  thank you for the clarification üôè,btohqsg
hi. need help. my approved hfe is 100k less than my prelim hfe üò± has anyone encountered this before? why does this happen? can appeal to hdb??,btohqsg
No problem!Also congrats on your key collection soon~~Coming soon~~ ü•≥,btohqsg
Erm  people don't always get the same grades during prelim and actual examsCan try appeal and stuffBut i don't think this HFE is really final tooAs in  income will be reviewed again when nearing key collectionI suppose a bigger concern if for SBF due to shorter waiting time for the flatOtherwise  review will be few years later and if income increases  there is a chance of higher loan amount eligibility,btohqsg
As long u can settle the deposit and stamp now and think future u can earn moreOr even throw in cash to cover the difference.,btohqsg
How about during unit selection if hfe amount is lower and can‚Äôt meet the required amount for the unit ?,btohqsg
