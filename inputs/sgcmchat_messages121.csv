looking for a sim game on playstation that has Sepang track. anyone knows?,btohqsg
because GT Sport no sepang :(,btohqsg
unfortunately i only have a playstation at home.,btohqsg
none of the GT have ?,btohqsg
so grid has sepang but when you say limited? what does it mean?,btohqsg
like the game isn't very good as a sim,btohqsg
compared to AC or even GT,btohqsg
ohhh‚Ä¶ i see i see so AC is still a better choice. and basically if we want to sim for sepang then PC is the only option to go?,btohqsg
that would be the best way to go,btohqsg
how‚Äôs the sepang track for AC? been updated or still running the file from 2017?,btohqsg
not too bad  but it's not the latest,btohqsg
ahh‚Ä¶ wonder if anyone would actually update it,btohqsg
there have been superficial attempts to get it visually up to date,btohqsg
but those are mainly just visual changes,btohqsg
Most of the time AC is always the better option,btohqsg
Ye but honestly PS has GT7 which is damn fun oso so,btohqsg
until you realise how much you need to grind,btohqsg
No ah but the range of cars is good,btohqsg
haha yes maxxed out Honda Fit Hybrid with slicks on the Nordschleife.,btohqsg
