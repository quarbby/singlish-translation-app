personally i just write the latex code in vscode and it compiles on change,btohqsg
I can imagine the horror your laptop dies   and you need to rewrite your  research paper from scratch again?,btohqsg
J1... clb hmm some guy on r/sgexams told is sec 3 level cl,btohqsg
Not sure if true or not since I dun take clb but regular cl,btohqsg
you can configure your editor to use it,btohqsg
mainly bc i need to collab with professors,btohqsg
so they can all edit it,btohqsg
before recently i just used a local version of texstudio,btohqsg
it's gaining traction recently as a much clear alternative to latex,btohqsg
given i still use latex due to its much more mature ecosystem,btohqsg
yea i've seen it but the collab reason is a big part of why i wouldn't switch rn,btohqsg
i believe that's only on the web app,btohqsg
SiaoYou also got documents for Chinese,btohqsg
i did say i'm using overleaf and it lets me give perms to collaborators to edit,btohqsg
anyway the journals i submit to have their own template,btohqsg
personally i don't see much reason to switch to smth else atp,btohqsg
also i like how the last part is just saying show that it's a harmonic  ofc without that technical term,btohqsg
Alrdy turned off my brain for 2 months+,btohqsg
quite nice doing math lecture slides with these.,btohqsg
i mean harmonics show up in physics a lot,btohqsg
iirc it is called laplace equation,btohqsg
Then you get the Fast Fourier Transform....,btohqsg
yes and that condition makes it a harmonic function,btohqsg
oh god. my nightmares in Engineering School passing that mod.,btohqsg
"ðŸ¤” just curious  how ""banana"" is your mandarin level?You can speak Mandarin well enough  but can't recall/recognize Characters is it?",btohqsg
Can speak-ish but even thats degrading  read and write cmi,btohqsg
This is quite a good book for those Differential Equations stuffs.,btohqsg
for a pure math perspective i would recommend a different book,btohqsg
yeahhh just cover most of the basic essentials.Before go into deep dive into Math Degree.,btohqsg
Most foreign beginners have this issue too   they cannot recall the Chinese characters and get used to the writing system,btohqsg
i basically had one math book bible for my undergrad,btohqsg
still use it unless it's an area that's super outside,btohqsg
Then depends on how creative the teacher   they grind the students into Chinese Language proficiency,btohqsg
Or Japanese if that is ....,btohqsg
I want to actly be proficient in chinese  maybe ill study it in ns or smth lol,btohqsg
mathematical methods for physics and engineering by riley  hobson and bence,btohqsg
to me  I think need to force people toå†™ç”Ÿå­— learning the write the Chinese Characters,btohqsg
same deal where it's just there as a reference to apply,btohqsg
since Americans are hoping into the trend since Tiktok is banned,btohqsg
will check it out when I have the time to review O.D.E.s and P.D.E.s,btohqsg
Lazy  wld rather get As done first,btohqsg
when is your CLB for A-levels lol,btohqsg
otherwise  if your Singapore have Primary School Mandarin textbook PDF from Primary 1-6 and Sec 1-5. Should just restart there  and learn and write Mandarin characters and form sentences.,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ i think its more of a student's capability to recognize characters.Singapore education system down side might be everything is in English. Until student doesn't have the brain power to logic in Mandarin. lol,btohqsg
unless PSLE era  there is a Mandarin Science/Maths syllabus.,btohqsg
Have a friend who can understand Japanese but can't read cl,btohqsg
Lol kinda strange too .... the concept of learning Japanese is quite similar to Chinese in terms of character being nearly similar in meaning,btohqsg
Haha ... being well in multiple languages helps in brain development,btohqsg
Even as adults not too late,btohqsg
American people are mocked online quite often for low rates of bilingualism ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
