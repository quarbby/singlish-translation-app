Hi!! Sorry to bother you! Can I just check for Singtel app payment  maybank family and friends 8%still applies this year? Thank you,btohqsg
Hello  could anyone suggest the best credit card combo for:1) 1k SGD spending/ month (50% dining  25% on online shopping and App Store subscriptions  25% on transport). 1/3 of this spend will be in FX/MYR.2) 1k SGD/ month on rental payment via IBG/PayNow3) Potentially 500 SGD/month for investing4) Planning to get UOBOne savings accountI‚Äôm wondering if it makes sense to go for air miles accumulation  and if so  with what credit cards? Thank you,btohqsg
1) sounds like a combo of Maybank family and friends + uob evol,btohqsg
Fnf can‚Äôt add to Apple Pay right :(,btohqsg
Vantage seems attractive for welcome offer,btohqsg
I tested with my wife and friend. If u are new to the bank  vantage will appear in your card list from the app.It seems like the 120k limit is not that strict for new to bank customer (not 12 month coool down),btohqsg
Assuming the spending criteria is not an issue  but i would like to go dbs/ocbc cc   should i be going vantage?,btohqsg
Yes . The trade off is 4K minimum spending.Unless ur income is 120k then no issue to play the cool down etc,btohqsg
Personally  I would go for DBS vantage and then play the cool down trick and apply for DBS altitude 2 years later,btohqsg
Have they tried to apply and get approved?,btohqsg
Hiii popo~ Yeapp ! That time I got asked u abt the $5 block thingyüòÇüòÇüòÇ.,btohqsg

The cool down trick takes around a year   right?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sureee if this is actually the case. But some say that if u can see vantage in ur credit card list  applying won‚Äôt be an issue.,btohqsg
Hi guys  any recommendation for credit cards usage for wedding banquet payments? (MCC 7011)Should I go for cards with good sign up rewards or cards that have good cashback / miles reward system?Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Yes. Unless ur income is 120k then vantage or altitude is not an issue.But personally I sign up for vantage cause i got a trip coming up and a big ticket spending.Annoying was I thought the sign up cut off date was 31may but they extend on 30may ü•≤,btohqsg
Sign up rewards first  especially if you're new to that bank,btohqsg
Anybody can explain the changes in Rewards Summary table from HSBC Revolution statement?Why did I not earn any bonus points? And I only earned 135 points,btohqsg
Anybody can explain the changes in Rewards Summary table from HSBC Revolution statement?Why did I not earn any bonus points? And I only earned 135 points when my statement with mostly eligible transactions amounted to $400*HSBC Revolution gives 10 points per dollar for eligible transactions. (4000 points for $400),btohqsg
Time properly bro. I was shocked when vantage approve instantly!,btohqsg
Anybody can explain the changes in Rewards Summary table from HSBC Revolution statement?Why did I not earn any bonus points? And I only earned 135 points,btohqsg
You shld have spent $135 this month right?,btohqsg
Is approve immediately  and i can start spending via apple pay before receiving the physical card right?,btohqsg
Yes bro! So see when is ur big ticket spending then apply imo,btohqsg
If it reflects as $135. Means only 135 is eligible.I had a long conversation with HSBC last weeks. That was how it was explained to me.Bonus miles will only be credited in the following month! But there‚Äôs a chance that this bonus will not reflect in your next month statement too!,btohqsg
I am planning to purchase a sofa with a budget of 800-1000. Using UOB platinum paired with Kris+ to purchase voucher stacked the miles on top of the Kris+ miles bonus?,btohqsg
If i change the statement date  it will not appear any points in my 1st adjusted statement ?,btohqsg
Yea. The bonus points will be credited by next calendar month! So the following month end you willl cfm see the bonus miles credited.So let say your next month statement generated on 15June. But bonus miles was credited on 25june.You will see ur bonus miles statement on 15july.So best is to track on your own.Upon hearing this  It‚Äôs damn messy imo,btohqsg
This was my understanding from HSBC last week and I‚Äôm waiting to cfm this. FYI,btohqsg
Ahh I see. I understand the bonus points now. Hmm but thats weird because I'm pretty sure most of my transactions are eligible. Is there a way to see which of my transactions are eligible?*Edit: Oh no i realised most of my food transactions were not eligible fromwhatcard.sg,btohqsg
Hsbc revo still useful for food? Went to a ramen place thought is 5812  end up is 5814...,btohqsg
But yet their cap is based on calendar month right ?,btohqsg
Please check your eligibile spending again. FYI they made some changes to the MCC code. Like grocery AND fast food are not considered .If all are eligible  it should be 403 credited to your statement given x1 base point.If you are unsure abt the transaction. U can call the bank or use heymax/amazelike what@ChrisHMSGmentioned in his videos! Very informative and useful.I think he got a referral code for both,btohqsg
same bro... i eat at koufu alot and now i realised koufu is also 5814 which is not eligible,btohqsg
Do anyone know if grab wallet top up consider qualifying spend ?,btohqsg
I see  thank you very much!,btohqsg
5814 is fast food ya? Soo ya lorrrr needa see alr,btohqsg
wow really huge nerf. much more than I thought,btohqsg
Food court. I think better to use amaze card,btohqsg
In my opinion.  Use hsbc only for restaurants such as crystal jade  imperial   paradise group.,btohqsg
I think ill use SC Smart card for Koufu from now on.,btohqsg
SCB Smart Card no bonus for Koufu though,btohqsg
Ooo I thought fast food is eligible?,btohqsg
Selected fast food like Mcd  Burger King etc. Read the tncs please.,btohqsg
