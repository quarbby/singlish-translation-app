Hi Gurus  for HSBC Revolution  May I know if there was any change in the conversion rate?I thought it was 400 points = $1Why now 280 points = $1?They buffer the rate? ü§î,btohqsg
I tried to find but can‚Äôt find the official announcement link. Anyone knows where to find the info?,btohqsg
Hi anyone  if my uob lady is dining category  do I get $1(6miles) when I use xnap in some food stalls?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúXnap lady‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.,btohqsg
Anyone had trouble with using SC smart credit card to take mrt? First time using  can tap in but cant tap out. Went to service counter  the person tell me this cc cannot use  but i tot simplygo is one of the reward category for this card? Not sure if the person anyhow say or wat ü§î,btohqsg
Does this work for vouchers at the rewards page too?Ie I can buy vouchers at the promo rate if 280 points per $1,btohqsg
It stated there  if you redeem  HSBC Reward Points for cash credit,btohqsg
Okie. Let‚Äôs say if I redeem all my points  but I don‚Äôt have any spendings to pay for for the previous month  will this result in a positive credit to my card?Or I can only the use points to offset what is already spent?,btohqsg
Hi I have a question on the uob one debit Mastercard. I used to perform transactions on Monday with credit card transactions to charity donation portal. The Uob one debit card did show the transaction posted successfully on Tuesday. But till then  I have not see it count against the $500 spending requirement in the account interest tracker. For sure  it will not get interest but I just want to count in the $500 spending requirement. There is nothing in T&C saying it will be excluded except for interest counting.,btohqsg
Donations not counted as eligible spend,btohqsg
Understood. Thanks. I tot it is only excluded for interest computation,btohqsg
Easiest way to meet quota for eligible spend is to buy physical NTUC vouchers from the aunty.,btohqsg
Hi can i ask for government and insurance will be excluded as well? Ex: road tax,btohqsg
Of course these are not eligible spend,btohqsg
But u buying every month to hit $500? I am trying to see how to hit the min spending as well,btohqsg
Of coz not. I can hit the Min soend so I don‚Äôt need to buy vouchers every month.Don‚Äôt get a min spend card if u can‚Äôt easily meet the Min though,btohqsg
Insurance is ok  not included for CC cashback,btohqsg
Yap. I thinking of that too. Groceries  utilities and teleco bills I computed can almost reached the $500 requirement. But to be sure  I will use my insurance to cover the ‚Äúlast mile. thanks for the advice,btohqsg
What is the best single credit card strategy to use in 2024Using mostly for ride hailing (grab  gojek  Ryde  tada  comfort taxi)Food delivery (foodpanda  grabfood  Macs)Digital subscription (Netflix  Disney+  Spotify  YouTube Premium)Pls advise.Thank you üôè‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Yup that why I still thinking should I get this uob one account.. I asked uob staff at branch which plans eligible for CC spent but didn't get a good reply though,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website can propose a list of best credit cards to use based on merchant or mcc code. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
So far it recommends Citi Rewards  HSBC Revo and SC Smart CCs,btohqsg
HSBC Revo??ü§î can this be used in your single credit card strategy?,btohqsg
hi  does anyone know if a msian can open a bank account in sg without a valid pass,btohqsg
I am using my card to consolidate the household expense (telco  utilities  dining) except grocery shopping which I use Trust card. Plus a bit from insurance expense and I was able to hit the $500 requirement. The good thing is these household expense will also generate bonus interest for you.,btohqsg
would you recommend DCS Ultimate Platinum CC ?,btohqsg
Is it a good time to convert HSBC revolution points to cash instead of miles?,btohqsg
Given that now 280 points=$1  saved 120 points,btohqsg
280 pts = 112 miles  0.89 cents per mile,btohqsg
I m not familiar with DCS card.,btohqsg
So tempting to convert into cash,btohqsg
Not a good value for me  but ymmv,btohqsg
Any promotion if convert into miles?,btohqsg
It is what it says on the box.Aside  there are many considerations  how much you spend monthly  whether you prefer cashback or miles... etc. Typically  if you only use one card  the cashback/mpd might not be so high,btohqsg
I prefer cashback. I spend 1K a month,btohqsg
DBS WWMC  not sure if digital subscription included.,btohqsg
Citi smrt  citi rewards  uob ppv,btohqsg
Hi all  is it advisable to get into any investment plans with an FA? If not  what other solutions are there that is simple and straight forward for normal folks? My sibling is being sold a plan and idk how to convince otherwise because my personal method is investing in US market which is not the most convenient.,btohqsg
Not a FA  but pls don't get them. I suggest taking a look at endowus very straightforward and easy user interface. U can use CPF  SRS and cash.,btohqsg
Invest in US market is also quite painless and cheap with endowus  just search lion global fund (spy500) or similar funds like amundi prime usa fund.,btohqsg
Why msian without a valid pass which is visitor pass will have the need to open a bank account in sg?,btohqsg
my aunt is no longer a PR  so she has to take back her cpf. but she doesnt want to take her money back to msia,btohqsg
I think can try go bank counter query and give such details,btohqsg
Local banks normally need a valid pass.. but if she Maybank account in Malaysia   maybe can check with Maybank in SG.,btohqsg
Maybank and OCBC allows as long you have Malaysian passport.UOB and DBS confirm cannot.,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I create krisflyer account for my child and linked to my account then  where to check the miles credited to my child and parental controls?,btohqsg
Simplest argument to convince against ILP with FA is to look at the fund-level and management fees being charged,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not showing under transfer miles section?,btohqsg
Is this the one you‚Äôre referring to?,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a min amount to invest?,btohqsg
