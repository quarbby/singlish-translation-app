Does paying insurance by citi payall earn reward and miles?,btohqsg
What does the tnc tell you? Normally insurance will not be included for credit card rewards,btohqsg
Take a look at the websiteI think should qualify just read thru the t&c and make sure it’s all good,btohqsg
More details will be provided soon,btohqsg
yes earn base miles/points if using fee paying citi payall,btohqsg
Does it count as qualifying spend for the rewards? (gifts),btohqsg
To be exact  it cannot be called earn miles  it shall be called buy miles via Citi Payall if you chose to pay the Citi payall fee. No paying fee  no miles.,btohqsg
Hi for UOB UOB Rising Dragon Savings Promotion which needs to lock in for 4 months if I have $100K in my account do I need to transfer out for one day or couple of days and transfer in? When I transfer out will it affect my OUB One Account monthly bonus? Thanks,btohqsg
There’s a referenced date that they will look at to determine the incremental funds. If your average monthly balance remains the same  it won’t affect the monthly interest,btohqsg
Can I just use the current $100K inside my account? Or need to transfer out? 🙏,btohqsg
It depends on what was your balance at the referenced date,btohqsg
