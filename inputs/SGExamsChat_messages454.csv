LOL ISNT THAT HOW YOULL TYPE IN CHINESE DICTIONARY,btohqsg
what in the world is this keyboard,btohqsg
You type out the strokes of the word then can come out alr,btohqsg
more of ‚Äògiving me a stroke‚Äô keyboard,btohqsg
people make your life easier make pinyin keyboard then you do this do yourself,btohqsg
I find this more ez than pinyin :o,btohqsg
HOW DO U EVEN USE A CHINESE DICTIONARY,btohqsg
HUH CAN SEARCH BY NUMBER OF STROKES OR WRITE USING HANDWRITING BESIDES PINYIN WHAT,btohqsg
but‚Ä¶ that defeats the purpose of the dictionary no‚Ä¶.?,btohqsg
unless I‚Äôm using dictionary for the wrong purpose. Dictionary is udk how to write the hanzi so u search the pinyin,btohqsg
or you know the word but dk the meaning,btohqsg

That's why I scared later I fail in uni HAHAHA,btohqsg
i mean honestly speaking from y1s1 experience  you'll really need to try to fail lol,btohqsg
what i'll sayis that uni is a different game altogether,btohqsg
this man was talking to me about how he thinks he'll fail,btohqsg
i had one mod in y1s1 i have absolutely no clue what was going on whatsoever   i think for the entire mod i only got like overall 40%,btohqsg
got away with a C for some reason,btohqsg
it is VERY difficult to fail like honestly,btohqsg

recoil doesn't affect you as much,btohqsg
Losing weight is fine. But don‚Äôt let it come at the expense of your mental/physical health!,btohqsg
It's not about losing weight  but losing the fats.,btohqsg
men are at the expense of my mental health,btohqsg
recoil ur fats also recoil x1000,btohqsg
it was what I observed. All the 90+ kg were more accurate.Last time I use carbine  which is lighter than M16 and SAR21  so recoil was quite bad,btohqsg
if I remember  SAR is around 4kg  M16 around 3kg and carbine around 2.5kg,btohqsg
i‚Äôd think its more of muscle tho,btohqsg
if u heavy but no muscle,btohqsg
u also got no strength to hold,btohqsg
M16 last time has this thing called rifle PT,btohqsg
now I heard is unarmed combat,btohqsg
