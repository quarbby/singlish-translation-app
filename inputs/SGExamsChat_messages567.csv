"professor all say ""this old alrd how they bully you""",btohqsg
Speaking of which my dad was telling us a story on this girl whos a hospital doctor,btohqsg
next year J1s have it much easier. Go JC,btohqsg
and how they were underpaid and shit and he said he told her that he advised his daughter to study medicine then the daughter said dowan,btohqsg

their whole assignment will be graded D aka 2.0,btohqsg
but this is only 10%  but if you voice out to the teacher  not only 10% is gone  their whole assignment worth 20 or 30% will be gone too,btohqsg
provided if your teacher has some level of eq,btohqsg
for eae right if all minimum entry met   but get 26/27/28   does the minus 2 cca point means will be eligible (24/25/26)?,btohqsg
ri got a lot of elitist ppl my frnd say,btohqsg
ri is literally a sch for the rich,btohqsg
as long as is independent sch. i have no words,btohqsg
@chemcersoon ill have fewer minutes than u have days,btohqsg
one of my favourite thijgs ive heard from an RI student is,btohqsg
"""H3 Math is so free in RI literally anyone who isn't smooth brained can take H3""",btohqsg
Ask blud how frequent does he lift,btohqsg

condo and landed and hdb is 50-50,btohqsg
"""He retook what he got advantage""",btohqsg

Cause the real cs gods are the ones frm NUS high,btohqsg

Eh tdy during CCA the annoying exco member went to talk to one of our juniors whos also an exco member,btohqsg
then the junior on the phone texting,btohqsg
I went to get props I came back then I was busy cleaning the glitter off my arm,btohqsg
Turns out the junior was shittalking abt the annoying one to her friend,btohqsg
Then the annoying one saw 💀💀,btohqsg
"So the text was ""Ketchup is so bossy"" or along the lines of that",btohqsg
And funny thing is that the junior's friend is also another member of the exco,btohqsg
blud somehow managed to piss off the sec ones 😭,btohqsg
sec two as lower sec rep means that their term will last until sec 3,btohqsg
so technically almost half their term wld be them not actually being lower sec,btohqsg
it was given to the sec ones,btohqsg
but since the exco now consists of all sec 3s and only 2 sec 1s,btohqsg
The sec ones kinda have been left out for a long period of time until like november,btohqsg
Nbcb exco prefect can be upper sec rep too???,btohqsg
Might as well give the position to me instead,btohqsg
Not nepotism js power of numbers,btohqsg
But all their leadership skills sibei jialat,btohqsg

If a country supports israel or palestine..it will show in their companies,btohqsg
What i never got from this conflict between israel and palestine is what..israel and paslestine are both trying to achieve...From my perspective as far as i can see. Palestine is fighting for its place in the world and want to be recognised as a soverign nation,btohqsg
even got an award for dk what,btohqsg
hi are bio answers out yet,btohqsg
tbh in the world we are living in now..saying a country not having a right to do something is like talking to the wall,btohqsg

"the fact you have to say ""today""",btohqsg
Yeah I admit I said stuff before,btohqsg

bro is attracting minors for the wrong reasons,btohqsg
i dont have no 07s or 08s or even younger messaging me,btohqsg
The only 07s and 08s I have messaging me are those that ask me for help for o levels stuff,btohqsg
expired for o levels help  expired for poly help..only can help jc and uni students,btohqsg
if you have a supposedly problematic person conversing with you  it just suggests youre entertaining it for them to continue or even start,btohqsg
Ya it's entertaining for me cuz it's fking hilarious,btohqsg
Bro is mad at me but I cba,btohqsg
"Out of no where i get a ""Are you gay"" text",btohqsg
and yet you continue to talk about it,btohqsg
i wanna see how he responds,btohqsg

no but fr the problematic part for me is he has issues with bedok but he doesnt wanna take it up with him he wanna take it up with me like bruh why u shitting on bedok's a level grades to me tell it to his face la,btohqsg
I normally dont block these kinda people cuz i like seeing the dms,btohqsg
Then i just laugh abt it with my friends,btohqsg
i think the problematic part is using a minor as your entertainment  even if its not in that sense,btohqsg
Brouhim not using a minor as entertainment. Hes the one shitting on me and im just here living my life,btohqsg
Some of them may be here btw,btohqsg

pasir leba is a fking nightmare,btohqsg
I knew sg was quite open…did not realise they were this open by displaying adult toys to potential minors,btohqsg
Then again adult stores window displays goes crazy in sg,btohqsg
wym one time at causeway point they were just selling sex toys out in the open as like a whole carnival,btohqsg
lmao minors acting like autistoc adults nowaydays + exposure so,btohqsg
Fun Fact: Some Watsons outlet sell sex toys as well,btohqsg
I would not even doubt those were massagers tho…did you see wrongly,btohqsg
fewer seconds than bedok has days,btohqsg
i wld wish to say i can relate,btohqsg

to cs major is anything besides cs is failure,btohqsg
coz u go cs cfm starting pay $5k,btohqsg
depends on what your goal is,btohqsg
kinda like the biomed in the early 2000s,btohqsg
today my poly faci talked about cs..and now i know why its such a hot course,btohqsg
i knew it was a very desirable course since sec school..but never knew why..just went with word of mouth,btohqsg
because I take modules for learning and not just for scoringb,btohqsg
161 credits needed to gradI studied till 183,btohqsg
almost enough extra for a full sem,btohqsg
oh i mean the pay is good  but my teacher told me CS is the course that will yield you the possibility of working with multi million dollar machines,btohqsg
my faci told me how he used to work for the straits times,btohqsg
within the foreseeable few years. But after that can change again,btohqsg
and he was in charge of the machine that would be used to show the statistics on screen,btohqsg
he said his machine cost quarter of a million,btohqsg
but he was headhunted by CNA,btohqsg
means any job also have people who excel,btohqsg
CNA offered him a better machine at 1million,btohqsg
I see my in laws neighbours  started with cleaning air consclean until multi millions,btohqsg
it was intresting hearing his life story tho,btohqsg
he now runs a company for air con servicing with over 50 vans,btohqsg
this is def not the reason so many people go into CS tho,btohqsg
servicing is the fastest way to make money,btohqsg
dependsalso have air con man friend still solo,btohqsg
im not saying fastest way to get rich,btohqsg
but fastest way to get yourself into a industry to form connections,btohqsg
studies have shown that..if you help people or ask people for help..they are more likely to become friends with you,btohqsg
easiest way is get born rich,btohqsg
next easiest way is marry rich,btohqsg
nah that is a lenghty process,btohqsg
born rich also lengthy. Need years to grow up,btohqsg
rob some small bank..also got away with less than 1k i think,btohqsg
"""Hello you have a parcel with Singpost. Please pay $2 for processing to SGExams""",btohqsg
Dont be like this guy if you rob a bank,btohqsg
i mean yea...i think its to do with ar/vr tho,btohqsg
this sem i have build a escape room in vr,btohqsg
did not realise..i was going into the technology so fast..just 3-4 weeks into the new sem,btohqsg
kinda daunting but if you never try  you will never know,btohqsg
theres more than just ar/vr btw,btohqsg
ML/AI  AR/VR  game dev  IoT much more i dont rmb of,btohqsg
for those who want starbucks recipe and want to try it out at home,btohqsg
“ just have to study hard and find one “ - my ss teacher said so,btohqsg
money is happiness… luxury brands or concerts gives us temp happiness but permanent happiness is that we do not have to deal w financial issues. life isn’t like fairytale.,btohqsg
sure i will work for myself to seem like an independent woman but i wld like to have a partner who can increase my financial status ???,btohqsg
im sure theres men ard to do that but im better off working hard to achieve it..,btohqsg
ya sia… esp when u divorce them  can get half of the assets,btohqsg
spend within your means  but if you want someone to add to your means  just dont make it the main trait,btohqsg
i didn’t start the conversation. someone did tho…,btohqsg
targetting to ppl who want their partner to provide,btohqsg
youd be surprised  theres an 18 year old girl who thinks a 130 dollar bouquet of roses  chanel and dior is not enough for a bdae gift,btohqsg
wait what does simi sai even mean,btohqsg
Yea but it’s all in the virtual reality and world creation front,btohqsg

I'm doing too much  I'm underpaid,btohqsg
Mine is cannot see plane  can hear plane,btohqsg
Let's hope SUSS letter works ah  love you MOE,btohqsg
I mean it’s a generalisation I guess but with reasons,btohqsg
What made u think that way,btohqsg
Someone remind me to find a spare day to just go back roast my colleagues,btohqsg
reminder to go roast then hard,btohqsg
Is everything bots to u tho,btohqsg
if its all bots to you id like for you to reconsider that ML/AI doesnt even have to go into the VR sector. it can do into cancer prediction  diagnosis  etcML/AI goes into using models to detect/categorise/segmentise things. not for funsies or VR or AR. VR and AR can work in harmony with -ok i cant be bothered to continue,btohqsg
cuz if can do machine learning model to predict breast cancer detection using RNN-CNN mixed   send him my way,btohqsg
It's ok guys we nice ppl don't roast oki,btohqsg
yes my comp science twin laoda,btohqsg
We nice he can do it in vr world,btohqsg
Just not without the w Infront of the r,btohqsg
where he sees things inside a machine,btohqsg
hope you understand your statement is pretty inaccurate with 2 students from the field guiding you,btohqsg
