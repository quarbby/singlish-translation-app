Anyway dc. CHarge too many time wear out ur batt,btohqsg
Ac charge cause batt deteoriate  slower,btohqsg
Actually it is the same. The difference is the heat. DC makes more heat which is what batteries don’t like. AC generates lesser heat. Good active battery cooling system solve this.,btohqsg
In the end  AC charging will convert to DC internally in the battery system and it just supplies a lower current. Thus why it is slower.,btohqsg
AC is alternate current then DC is direct current right,btohqsg
AC is better in case a circuit breaks down if iirc from my physics class 🤣,btohqsg
You combine both it becomes ACDC which is the name of a heavy metal group band. 😆,btohqsg

The heat increases in dc causes a loss in current  I.e. the longer you charge on dc  the lesser current your ev gets due to heat gain I.e. spend money for lesser current,btohqsg

COE quota for Feb-Apr up 8.2%; about 10% rises in quota for categories A  B  C and ETotal number of COEs rises to 17 133 as changes mostly stable across categories.https://bt.sg/cWo2,btohqsg
How does it mean? COE up or down?,btohqsg
Cos if seperate out  not a lot,btohqsg
1299/6 bidding only abt 216 per bidding. Then U allocate to the diff cat,btohqsg
#PSA#COEquota for Feb to Apr 2025 will be 17 133  which is 8% higher than last quarter  and 16% higher than the same quarter last year.This follows our update last year that starting from Feb 2025  LTA will progressively inject up to 20 000 additional COEs over the next few years.,btohqsg
All the numbers are here. Not a HUGE increase but maybe enough for a slight drop,btohqsg
Thank u so the solution is dc charge just 5 or 10 mins n go?,btohqsg
Don't charge too long? So heat can dissipate?,btohqsg
Uhh usually can just charge to 80% for fast charging. If your car is decent it would prob actively cool and charge same time. No issues one.,btohqsg
Jaecoo j6 cooling system u know is good?,btohqsg
cat A extra 106 / cat B only extra 66 / cat E 19 piece per bid nia,btohqsg
dont think will drop any significantly. if drop also is technical drop due to hitting 121k,btohqsg
not because of the extra quota,btohqsg
PHV will snap it all up,btohqsg
