"After topping up MA  the amount here is still not updated and it says ""special account"". I thought the tax relief of $8000 is for both SA and MA.",btohqsg
For those that have topped up CPF MA  do you see this being updated on your dashboard?,btohqsg
I think MA topup is not part of $8k,btohqsg
max top up for self is $8k  shared between MA and SA,btohqsg
Not sure if this is a system issue or am I missing something here?,btohqsg
Will check later but ..  it only day 1 donâ€™t worry la. As far as the option to top up after 8k is done the SA section is showing me $0 available for top up so all are in order.,btohqsg
Just give it a while to update. As long as total amount of RSTU and VCMA is $8k  you'll be fine.,btohqsg
Thanks all. Another quick question  if I have reached the FRS  can I still top up MA for tax savings?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know where to invest in digital gold is more convenient and trustable?,btohqsg
Why top up MA instead of SA?Are there any benefits or up to own preference.,btohqsg
Not very familiar with investingðŸ˜…  is gold ETFs the same as those digital gold sold by ocbc?,btohqsg
Or is it a different thing?,btohqsg
Happy New Year all! Any good high yield savings account promo for Jan 2025?,btohqsg
Different. There are little information on the paper Gold sold by OCBC. You can read up some info from OCBC itself here:https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/articles/ten-burning-questions-about-gold.pageIMO  gold ETF/physical gold may be better than OCBC paper gold. The main reason is that they're backed physical gold.The no sales charge or no custodian fees is a common tactic to lure people to buy in  OCBC is likely to charge higher prices through the price spread.Remember  banks are for-profit organisations  there's no free lunch in life.Not financial advice.

Any opinions for platform to purchase gold etf? I quite new to investing  but i have purchased physical gold bar many years ago and find it have been constantly rising  so quite inclined to try out.But the physical gold i bought is from like those jewellery store in the form of gold bar and the price was high due to their crafting fee and their shop gold price. Any platform do you know of to purchase Physical gold at a fair price?,btohqsg
For physical gold. Don't buy from jewellery store. Buy from something like bullionstar.,btohqsg
I bought solid gold bars from old uncle bullion shops. They will come with receipt and often not far from the live spot price.You can often negotiate with them if you get more pieces as they probably got it much cheaper years ago. Dont buy decorated ones. There are solid bars in 50g 100g which is quite easy to store.,btohqsg
What is old uncle bullion shops?,btohqsg
Like those old bullion shops you find in mature HDB estates run by old uncles or aunties. Not to be confused with pawn shops where you often cant get very good value for buying and selling.,btohqsg
Have not received for Dec. UOB late due to holidays?,btohqsg
Ya. Public holiday wont credit. Maybe tomorrow balance will increase and the day after entry will show up.,btohqsg
regarding uob uni$ for lady credit card  anyone have successfully appealed before?I stayed at kimpton hotel back in nov + chose travel as the reward category but did not receive the bonus  so far no issues for other hotels,btohqsg
What is the mcc? Not all hotels are under hotel mcc  some are under non travel mcc..,btohqsg
yea  issue is uob don't publish the list of mcc,btohqsg
i saw online mcc for kimpton is 3838,btohqsg
You need to chat with cso what is the mcc of that particular transaction.Is the hotel in Dubai ?,btohqsg
okies will call cso tmr  no kimpton hotel in bkk,btohqsg
It has always been first working day of following month.,btohqsg
What is the best creditcard(either miles or cashback) to topup nets flashpay card which is used for carpark parking? Seems pretty much all excluded ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Not the additional 3.6 mpd bonus from the ladys card. I was referring to the additional bonus miles if you set aside some money in the UOB ladyâ€™s savings account. Usually it is given on 28th of the month.,btohqsg
It is in liao on 27 dec,btohqsg
Dec lady saving acc bonus will be in jan 27th. If you asked about nov bonus  yes pts were in on dec 27th.,btohqsg
But amex has 50 cents charge per transaction for top up? ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Oh yeah I meant the one in Nov. darn time to call UOB Liao ðŸ¤£ thanks all!,btohqsg
1.5 percent cash back on 100 top up is 1.50 minus 50 cent net 1 dollar,btohqsg
May I check if I have both UOB One and EvoL  which one should I can cancel? Understood either card spending will be eligible for the one account bonus interest,btohqsg
May i check for EV charging payment (pay as you go)  is maybank plat visa  citi cashback+ and Uob evol eligible for cashback and one account spending respectively,btohqsg
I topup lots and lots of nets flashpay card using trust Cashback transport category before they neft.,btohqsg
#dpJust xferred $150k from esaver to UOB one acc successfully.,btohqsg
Mind only need to spend $2288.Why u need $3888? ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
Everyone different. Based on user data.,btohqsg
Hi everyone. Is uob the only bank that recognize salary transfer via paynow? Does ocbc recognise it too?,btohqsg
Anyone uses OCBC NXT card? The Cashback I get doesn't make sense..  it used to be the eligible spending in statement x 0.5/1%  but now I am somehow getting more than expected.. anyone has similar experience?Well  I am not complaining,btohqsg
Hi all  any suggestions where I can park my CPF OA to generate at least 3% interest (risk free)?,btohqsg
Hey all  very silly question here. Wondering if any seasoned UOB Ladyâ€™s user with dinning category can confirm that itâ€™s safe to add Ladyâ€™s card to ShopBack to pay for food & drinks stall via QR code,btohqsg
Will soon no longer be available for those 55 & above,btohqsg
Transfer to SA if before 55  RA if after 55 (for CPF Life  interest will be pooled). Both risk free  4%.,btohqsg
Sadly i didnt get it. Gotta stop spending on dbs so they will lower spend requirements.,btohqsg
"for those that signed up for the UOB save up promotion that ends in dec  did have they ""earmarked"" the money?",btohqsg
thank you!  looks like i understood wrongly,btohqsg
