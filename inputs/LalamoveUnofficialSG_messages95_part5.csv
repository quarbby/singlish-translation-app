Somemore now petrol keep increase price. No +$ take the job actually quite bor hua,btohqsg
"Take the top tier for example.1020 - 95(diamond incentive) = 925925/60 jobs = 15.41 per job.If u are driving car  u get about 15 per job on average.So u are basically adding pressures to yourself for the ""GIS""",btohqsg
Yah. Because they only count 4 days a week. Thatâ€™s the catch. Itâ€™s not spread over 7 days.,btohqsg
To do alot of jobs  u have to take evry ikan bilis. Then miss out on the better paying jobs,btohqsg
Either that  or b4 the job got +$ u just take. End up all the jobs don't need +$ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Cancel and we will be soft ban for one day?,btohqsg
Better be careful of those Indian restaurants at little india.,btohqsg
They like to edit their orders... keep adding in addition location,btohqsg
Just avoid this virgin pizza at Asia square. Sabo my one order.,btohqsg
And I canâ€™t do any order for the whole damn day,btohqsg
Actually many people say stack will get ban by oddle. So far I alway stack on weekend orders but not ban by oddle for it,btohqsg
I really think it boils down to the timing. If you are late  most probably will get van,btohqsg
Do u stack multiple advance orders? Or had advanced orders on hand then stack one immediate otw? Cos i never late also kena ban,btohqsg
As long u dont late... should be ok,btohqsg
But sometimes..... many unexpected factors came in,btohqsg
stack those shop u are familiar  dun anyhow stack,btohqsg
Admin can start a comment thread for them to blacklist all the senders? Easier to keep track.,btohqsg
I sent once for them. They kinda micro managed you. Keep repeatedly informing no stack order and call u to check your whereabouts,btohqsg
U never late but got ban ? U stack 3 to 4 ?,btohqsg
Usually I will take those one order first then I wait for other orders on the way to flash out and I take them,btohqsg
So taking advance orders in future have to be careful especially on weekends with very tight schedule. One merchant just edit and add one more drop off for you  all your pick ups after that will be affected.,btohqsg
No  max 2. I tried stack before from same time  same restaurant same direction. Both orders kena cancelled kena ban. Also tried 2 different advance orders 45mins apart  latter order kena cancelled kena ban. I was very sure i will not be late. Can even complete first order n proceed to second order pick up on time.,btohqsg
Have experienced this since early sep but that time no drivers voice out i thought my app got problem. Ask CS say no issue  write in to them also useless.,btohqsg
Used to be able to stack 4 advanced orders also no issue and all completed on time. No love letter  no user cancellation or ban.,btohqsg
Now they detect any stacking they will probably just cancel ur order. And like what some drivers mentioned  even if user cancel we drivers also kena 'soft ban',btohqsg
Did they change the time frame? Used to be more than 30mins apart as far as i rem. This was when scheduled orders (yellow) turn to immediate orders (orange) 30mins before actual pick up time.,btohqsg
I didn't know can stack sia,btohqsg
I always take 2 jobs with 30 min timing difference. But the later job is I know will usually give earlier.,btohqsg
Like this you will not break any rule,btohqsg
Any seasoned driver will know which shop will usually give earlier.... right?,btohqsg
Those no sure shop  better dont take the risk.,btohqsg
Most impt must b familiar with route. Need give buffer for resto late,btohqsg
For every weekend isit got new mission to hit?,btohqsg
Cannot be late for pick up or delivery too.,btohqsg
This order was immediate order. I got order  within 10mins reach resto. Resto told me order was already cancelled some time back cos they couldn't get driver n their customer wait until sian so cancel the order. Start of the mth. Now then send me a driver no show noticeðŸ™„ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Best thing was resto had requested cancellation way b4 I saw the order  haiz the system is cock,btohqsg
So guys  pls make sure u keep track of ur cancelled orders  anytime will kena,btohqsg
Llm is getting hard to work,btohqsg
If it's easy any Tom dick Harry also will do,btohqsg
Cao will tell uDid  call b4 process?,btohqsg
So llm need very talented ppl to work?Yet these talented ppl whom work llm only earn peanuts..Now stack 2 jobs  pick up from same restaurant going same direction also tio cancel means GG,btohqsg
If u think peanuts then don't do,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think LLM pay peanuts to be honest. Sometimes weekend I took before $35 for one trip from town to Hougang,btohqsg
I always stack for LLM. I think it is about meeting the timing ba,btohqsg
Got try to use another account to do ?,btohqsg
No oddle really no point to do LLM,btohqsg
No stack orders really very hard to do if car ..,btohqsg
Take note: PIE towards Tuas after Thomson Road is closed. All lanes are blocked.,btohqsg
mee too they cancel then charge me no show also lol,btohqsg
So nowadays cannot stack orders at all ? Last time there was a period LLM say can stack de mah,btohqsg
