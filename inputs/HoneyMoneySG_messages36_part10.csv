Just want to confirm  will we get 1% cash back for credit card bill paid using GIRO HSBC EGA. I have HSBC CC. Letâ€™s assume this month I need to pay bill for $100  will I get 1% of bill paid. Pls help to clarify. Thanks,btohqsg
Hmmm...I'm just trying out didn't really calculate...what do you think?,btohqsg
yes for giro bill payment of non-HSBC cc,btohqsg
not a very good earn rate,btohqsg
The CardUp fee abit high...if below $10 I think will be good ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Does Amex TCB still earn 1.5% cash back when topping up grab pay?Can we still pay Ntuc income insurance using grab pay? A bit confused with all the nerfs. Iâ€™m new to grabpay. Thanks!,btohqsg

hi does anyone know - is it true that UOB FD for EURO doesnâ€™t pay any interest for some reason?,btohqsg
This is for AY2023 income tax? You should have waited for cardup to release their income tax promo code. Usually lower at current rates. Can save more in fees,btohqsg

I stopped receiving cashback for everyday rewards since Monday and today I couldn't Paynow using my account. Upon calling CSO I found out that my account is restricted. I opened it online  and went down to update my signature for the giro application. Yesterday giro wasn't deducted too. So sick of this bank  no notice  no email  no sms. I wouldn't know that my account is restricted if I didn't attempt to paynow today,btohqsg
if insuranced by sdic then ok lah,btohqsg

The app can contain the ecapital value   got state expiry date one,btohqsg
It will be added to your ecapitavoucher balance in the app  can use it like cash and don't need to use the entire voucher amount.,btohqsg
Depends you going for miles / cb. For me miles  would use Citi Rewards or HSBC Revolution. For Cb  would use EVOL / DBS Live Fresh.,btohqsg
Ah ok thanks for the info. Wasn't sure initially if I had to spend it in a single transaction or if I could use it over multiple transactions,btohqsg
