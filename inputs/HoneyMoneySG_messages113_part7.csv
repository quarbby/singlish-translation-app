U nedd do your own math's LoR,btohqsg
On balance of 20k  HSBC EGA and SCB eSaver account gives more than both UOB One account and OCBC 360 account.,btohqsg
2 more month for u to r&d,btohqsg
Thank you for reading the t&c for us,btohqsg
I thought only fresh fund? The balance average every month I think based on the increment..,btohqsg
If you rotate then it's fresh,btohqsg
Oh.. idea! Every month keep rotating between the 2 banks. Haha,btohqsg
Just wondering until how much savings than change strategy?,btohqsg
Is it still beneficial if you’re not doing a reset month or uob doesn’t have any ongoing promotion?,btohqsg
There’s other cards other than ocbc 365,btohqsg
What’s the point of putting in 2k only,btohqsg
I'm using 90N with card up to pay insurance and clock the 500 spend for OCBC 360. Then use Citi rewards with amaze for daily spend,btohqsg
Can consider ocbc infinity if you prefer cashback,btohqsg
If let's say if you undecided between uob and hsbc.. I feel can divide equally the sum between both banks.,btohqsg
Infinity card also can go with cardup? But the fees by cardup more than infinity cashback I think.,btohqsg
Not much cashback card can beat cardup fee,btohqsg
Worth meh use card up got extra % to pay insurance what's about town council and home electric bills and mobile bills,btohqsg
Yea this is my next card once I get my ocbc savings up. PROVIDED they don’t change and tnc to the savings account or the card,btohqsg
My insurance is just over 500 per month  the interest gained in 360 account can cover back the cardup fee,btohqsg
Plus I giro 90n bill to HSBC to get 1% cashback so still not bad,btohqsg
This giro bill method  the 1% is on your balance of hsbc ega or it’s 1% on the card bill? Do I need any balance in ega?,btohqsg
All above I use card up or citi pay all,btohqsg
Maybe can understand the interest mechanism for hsbc first before suggesting this,btohqsg
1% cashback on the card bill. Need to maintain at least 2k in HSBC EGA account  else will be charged fall below fee,btohqsg
At the start of the month I transfer 2k in  then do 5 txn. Leave only 2k + amt needed for giro deduction of credit card bills,btohqsg
100k/150K and able to meet the HYSA criteria,btohqsg
This 5 transaction can be either transfer in or transfer out?,btohqsg
Can do 5 FAST transfers out from EGA account or spend using HSBC debit card also can,btohqsg
Sry for the confusion. I'm not suggesting infinity for cardup but for day to day spending to hit 500 spend of OCBC 360 acc,btohqsg
Hi  need some clarification. When spending with instarem amaze+crmc  is the 1% fee applicable to spending 1k (exact) or above 1k,btohqsg
for cumulative domestic spending amounts on top and above 1k in calendar month,btohqsg
So spending of 1k exact no fee will be charge right,btohqsg
Cos I gng jus make 1 transaction of 1000,btohqsg
no fee if that is the only domestic transaction in the calendar month  unless mcc 4111 or 6540,btohqsg
Hi when does OCBC 360 account pays out interest?,btohqsg
Thanks to@ChrisHMSGfor helping me to bring to Longbridge attention. I just gotten the $80 sign up cash bonus now after another round of appeal.,btohqsg
7th working day of the month,btohqsg
So that means for this month it’ll be 11th June?,btohqsg
most likely. not sure if saturday counts as their working day for interest credit,btohqsg

Hi I just apply for uob evol card. Last time I used uob one. Now  if I spend 300 on uob one  and 300 on uob evol  can I get the uob bonus interest? I credit 1600 too. Or do I need to hit 500 on either card?,btohqsg
Why u want to spilt the spending  u get no cashback for uob one like this and 0.3 cashback for evol like this,btohqsg
Cos uob one is good for shell petrol discount,btohqsg
Combine both spending to $500 will be entitled to uob saving interest,btohqsg
But spending below 500 on uob one card doesn't have the quarterly rebate,btohqsg
It is not about combine  it is about maximise the biggest benefit with cc and uob one acct combo,btohqsg
Then if I spend 300 each? I got no cash back?,btohqsg
Please see my reply i think clear enough,btohqsg
U have to hit the min spend   uob $500   Evo $600   Evo enhanced $800,btohqsg
I apply the uob evol cos I see 8 percent so I tot use it for all except petrol I use uob one…,btohqsg
