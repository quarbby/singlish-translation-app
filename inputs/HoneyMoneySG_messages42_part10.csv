I don't think so. As far as I know  none of the MAS licensed brokers allow investment to be made by credit card.,btohqsg
What do you guys think abt this?,btohqsg
If someone clocked already clocked $1000 CRMC+Amaze strategy  would it be better to use CPM directly? Or CPM + Amaze?,btohqsg
4 mpd on foreign currency. If you use Amaze  it will be charged local currency. Also suggest you to read full TnC.,btohqsg
Take note of the minimum spend. I think itâ€™s something like $3000 or $5000.,btohqsg
That's the reason I suggested him to read TnC. People rarely read full TnC ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
For credit card  nope because the HDB transaction is classified as a Govt Service (MCC 9399). You might be able to use Giro and get 'rewards'. U can read through the messages in this channel.,btohqsg
Alright thanks ! Itâ€™s a waste that hdb doesnâ€™t have Amex payment ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I think hdb is smart not to accept Amex instead ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If on fairprice app to pay for groceries or koptiam and pay via Google pay linking DBSWWMC or HSBC does it have 4mpd?,btohqsg
Not sure whether I misunderstand. You can use either FairPrice app or or Google Pay  to pay. The former is an online transaction. The latter is a PayWave transaction.,btohqsg
Yes :) that's considered an online transaction. Note you can only earn up to $20 for the 5% online transaction CB category.,btohqsg
Iâ€™m sorry May I know Iâ€™m already successfully registered for April HSBC EGA 4.35% offer . I can still top up even after April right because the calculation is based on ADB and the reference month is March . Letâ€™s say I top up on the 1st of June and withdraw on 1st of August I can still be able to earn 61 days 4.35% interest right ?,btohqsg
I do not see an explicit exclusion for public transport. So  I think u would get rewards.,btohqsg

Today is Friday again and that means $3 cashback from DBS Paylah Hawker promo!ðŸ‘‰ DBS Paylah $5 code CHRHAF684I did not use the offer today as I have a separate lunch appointment. So here is a pic of my previous lunch of Plain Naan with Chicken Curry. For those who like to eat Roti Prata  maybe can consider switching to Naan as it is baked instead of fried with lots of oil like Prata. Can also add fillings like butter or cheese in the naan.Cost of meal: $5.50Cost of drink: $1.00Net cost for lunch: $6.50ðŸ‘‰ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgðŸ‘‰ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg

Credit or debit? Amex or visa. Thinking to get debit card cos to many cc,btohqsg
Hi  if i have 2 cards with OCBC with min spends  is the min spend combined or do I have to hit min spend for individual cards?,btohqsg
As each card of the same bank charges annual fees individually  min spend also applies to individual cards.,btohqsg
Each wk fully redeemed 2h earlier ðŸ˜‚ DBS is reducing cost or users increased by double fold ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Nooooo itâ€™s so early today. I just left the office for lunch ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I think really got more users bah  I saw someone said that thereâ€™s more uncles and aunties learning how to use paylah because of this ðŸ˜… then people becoming more kiasu and redeeming it earlier ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
The funny thing just now is I was queuing at the hawker centre and it wasnâ€™t fully redeemed yetâ€¦ but when it was my turn to order  it became fully redeemed ðŸŒšðŸŒšðŸŒš,btohqsg

Or does ipaymy work for American Express cards too?,btohqsg

Hi all; i have money in Tiger Vault  anyone know how can i withdraw out into my bank a/c?,btohqsg
CSPX does not pay dividends to begin with. It is a Accumulating ETF :),btohqsg
Your funds in Tiger Vault is invested with a MMF fund manager as units. U need to sell your units. U need to wait (a few trading days? ) for the sales proceed of the units to be available for withdrawal.If u enable 'auto invest'  things would  get a little 'interesting'. U need to find out what timedailyTiger would sweep your S$/US$ to the MMFs and raise the withdrawal request before the time. This is to ensure your monies would not get back to the Vault to BUY MMF units.,btohqsg
Sorry im getting confused. Meaning I have to click on redeem first to sell?,btohqsg
If all your cash has been invested into the MMF as units  u need to redeem to sell your units to get back S$/US$.,btohqsg
Mindful that (I suppose) this is not an investment channel  this a good article for background reading.https://www.justetf.com/en/news/etf/distributing-or-accumulating-etfs-how-to-handle-investment-income.html,btohqsg
From increase in nav of ur fund. Basically the fund manager will use the dividend (after div withholding tax) and buy more share of the underlying fund. The number of cspx share u hold wont increase  but the unit price of the share will. Thats y if u compare cspx vs other distributing etf like spy  cspx price move up more.,btohqsg
This is a theoretical explanation taking out market forces. With market forces  CSPX unit price would fluctuate like any other Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) on the stock exchange.,btohqsg
Folks  please feel free to correct me if this is inaccurate :),btohqsg
sure  there are issues with tracking error and of cos day to day fluctuation  but the difference is very obvious over time (blue line is cspx),btohqsg
I did a capstone project on CSPX vs S&P500 index for a 10 year period up till April 2022. Data says it all. Always choose accumulating ETF or Unit Trust for your long-term investment. It is always more efficient as compared to distributing ETF or Unit Trust options. The compounding effect is always powerful.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing with the folks here. I agree with u. Unfortunately  limited MAS licensed low cost Brokers support London Stock Exchange (LSE).I guess the closest on these platforms is VOO but is still a distributing ETF ðŸ˜‚.This is another background well written reading article for folks for ETF.https://seedly.sg/opinions/the-best-s-p-500-etf-for-singaporeans/,btohqsg
Hi guys  is there a credit card that I can use to make recurring annual insurance premiums payment and also provide 12 mths interest free installment payments? Thanks,btohqsg
The latest offering by Endowus on S&P500 investment is worth considering other than the usual CSPX  VOO  SPY  IVV etc. At least the cost is lowered for retail investors like us. More options to choose. Just for sharing.https://endowus.com/insights/blackrock-ishares-passive-index-funds,btohqsg
Thanks. I think this is good for those who want to DCA but not enough DYOD to follow through the funding monthly. I would take a look :),btohqsg
As far as I know  Ocbc cashflo card. I have not tried before. Quite sure there are TnC that exclude some insurance companies.For me  I use DBS myPreferred plan and choose the 3 months plan for fees avoidance.,btohqsg
Any idea how long it takes to receive the physical Instarem card after application?,btohqsg
Take about 3 business days for my case.,btohqsg
