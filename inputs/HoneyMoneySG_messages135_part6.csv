Any guru here knows how to use KF miles for scoot as I read that we can do so. I know for SIA there is a table to show how much miles I need to fly  but how can I find the miles for scoot  assuming it is lower miles required compared to SIA.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs recommended to do so,btohqsg
Only scenario I would do that is when the flight time is really what u want.,btohqsg
Unless you will never take SQ  using KF miles to reduce scoot fare isn't worth it.,btohqsg
I see  is it because the flight is cheaper compared to SIA but yet the miles used are pretty high. So the miles per dollar savings isnt worth it at all.,btohqsg
does this apply for existing UOB card holders!,btohqsg
Can I ask about pairing Amaze and Maybank family and friends.I don't opt for groceries as my category but I opt for dining as 1 of my category.1. When I tap the amaze card using google pay for restaurant in JB  it will utilize the $312.5 allowance right?2. When I tap the amaze card using google pay for groceries in JB  it will utilize the $312.5 MYR&IDR allowance right?3. All the spending in JB will receive 8% cashback  right?I did my transaction last Sunday and I checked this morning the ticker has not moved. Thanks for advice,btohqsg
when at the checkout  there will be a option to ask if u want to use ur KF miles (must log into scoot w ur krisflyer acct). then they will ask how much u wna claim and etc and deduct from there,btohqsg
1  yes 312.5 for dining2. no. cannot use with amaze for the MYR category  as amaze will convert to SGD3. All spend not excluded and in MYR capped at 312.5,btohqsg
1050 Krisflyer Miles for S$10 Scoot fare. Not worth if compared to SQ Business redemption  unless have small amount expiring miles.,btohqsg

For standard charter credit card if we apply one year ago and do not receive the reward that‚Äôs mean we do not eligible for any reward. Normally when till we receive the rewards for new application?,btohqsg
anyone knows what is the MCC for lalamove?,btohqsg
thank you for the reply.Can I ask again for online purchase using citi rewards credit card  I don't need to link to amaze and just pay direct to get miles or cashback  right?Linking citi rewards to amaze to earn cashback or miles is only for manual paywave using google pay and it will be limited to 1k per calendar month  correct?,btohqsg
I see. Not sure if the t&c got change since quite long ago,btohqsg
yes can use citi rewards directly for local online to get 10x points. If online transaction is processed overseas can use Amaze+CRMC to save on the fx fees or cross border fees.Citi rewards card 10x points is limited to 1k spend in statement month.Amaze card 1% if exceed 1k in SGD spend in calendar month.,btohqsg
Hi all. Anyone know if renovation cost counted or eligible for miles collection? DBS altitude,btohqsg
Hi! I made payment through apple pay with my instarem Amaze card  which is linked to my citi rewards card. Will i receive 4MPD for this transaction? I don‚Äôt seem to see it. TIA!,btohqsg
Is it posted? What was the mcc?,btohqsg
5732 is not excluded. Amaze + crmc w apple pay should work as I've done it many times.,btohqsg
Maybe time to ring Citi cso,btohqsg
Is topping up MA or RA the preferred approach?,btohqsg
Oh okay thank you! Meaning it was supposed to be shown on my Citi app right?,btohqsg
no separate tracking but your citi tk points should increase accordingly,btohqsg
Hmm ok it didn‚Äôt increase at all  thank you I‚Äôll give citi a call :),btohqsg
is it possible to get citibank to change the citi rewards statement month to calendar month instead?,btohqsg
if your statement month is not calendar month  you are out of luck. Last i know  they only change it to 10 or 15 of the month.,btohqsg
