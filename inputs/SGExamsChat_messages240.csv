text,group
you are a poly student rightwhich course are you in,btohqsg
for me it's half online half paper eh,btohqsg
And my lecturers for two of them suck,btohqsg
honestly I think i am the one who sucksnot my lecturers,btohqsg
esp when u can learn by looking at the lab sheets,btohqsg
hi guys! if anyones from hope church i'd like to ask abt some stuff  pls pm me. thankyou sm :),btohqsg
anybody used SLS before? Is the account username the person's name or ic or what ah,btohqsg
first 5 letters of ur full name and last 5 characters of ur ic,btohqsg
Idk if they change to jus ic tho,btohqsg
I nv open for v long,btohqsg
"Jnsomeome send some ""/help"" then some bot",btohqsg
Start meto get the list of commands,btohqsg
not sure if im allowed to ask this here but can someone tell me what is the formula i need to use to find the resistance values 😳,btohqsg
does that ping peopple or what,btohqsg
this one is principles of engineering 😭,btohqsg
parallel voltage is constantseries voltage not constant,btohqsg
Current is inversely proportional to resistance for constant voltage,btohqsg
ie twice the current means half the resistance,btohqsg
1/x + 1/y + 1/z = aresistance = 1/a,btohqsg
but to find last value need volt what... no meh,btohqsg
Total current in = total current out,btohqsg
lucky i stil have my sec sch notes,btohqsg
ok i understand where you are coming from   but how do you find resistance with current only ?,btohqsg
you need voltage to use with current to find resistance,btohqsg
This is a parallel circuit  so the potential difference across each resistor is the same,btohqsg
You can calculate the potential difference if you want,btohqsg
ok i understand now... thanks lolz,btohqsg
It's faster to just calculate the current directly,btohqsg
is there anyone who never use paylah before,btohqsg
paylah q convient for poly tho,btohqsg
just scan qr and type in how much you want to pay,btohqsg
most shops outside mostly have SGQR  which I can use my bank app for,btohqsg
for PayNow  either bank app or Google Pay  which I've been using before they started their cashback/rewards thing,btohqsg
Me as an intellectual dealing exclusively in coins,btohqsg
Mus present to them your marvelous hoard of 10cent coins,btohqsg
Why do it with some pixels when u can show off your wealth in material,btohqsg
Why use it to pay money,btohqsg
Anyone here alr in NTU taking ph1012 ?,btohqsg
Eh tmr got no sch for sec kids ah,btohqsg
Till the pigs in my house complaining,btohqsg
Then work got ph in lieu anot,btohqsg
Well its cuz usually I hear ppl give worser names,btohqsg
Why sec got why poly/JC/IB/Ite dh de,btohqsg
💀💀 I tot they also sch,btohqsg
But its ok  im alr on holidays,btohqsg
I got exam tomorrow 1 F for me,btohqsg
Bruh I miss secondary school so badly,btohqsg
Pleeze  back when pri sch students were doing models,btohqsg
May the Dean's list bless you,btohqsg
Wait omg jn did someone talk abt metal in a gaseous state,btohqsg
Or is my mind creating false memories,btohqsg
Omg but I rmb seeing someone talking abe metal in gaseous state,btohqsg
But I can't find it haha,btohqsg
💀💀 since when got gaseous metal one,btohqsg
Cuz the textbook dint tell me abt it,btohqsg
Textbook doesn't tell u a lot of things,btohqsg
Den u tell me why can,btohqsg
just heat up the metal enough,btohqsg
You usually only think of metal as the solid state,btohqsg
So if we breathe in metal gas can we increase our iron,btohqsg
If you breathe in metal gas your insides will melt from the heat,btohqsg
You wouldn’t have survived at that temperature,btohqsg
metal gas only exists under certain conditions,btohqsg
Cause the iron gas will solidify in your lungs,btohqsg
You know how hot is it?,btohqsg
Qhat if u trapped it in a gas syringe and cooled it,btohqsg
and most of the time its a few thousand degrees,btohqsg
then you'll get a syringe with iron...?,btohqsg
just replace your metal gas with steam,btohqsg
💀💀 I swear I alw learn sth new from ppl I don't know,btohqsg
I don’t think our skins melt,btohqsg
chem is so much more than a tb,btohqsg
Anyway the textbook kind of says it,btohqsg
It says matter exists in solid liquid gas,btohqsg
So metal exists in solid liquid gas,btohqsg
Idk eh ppl jus tell me memorise tb can liao,btohqsg
and perhaps even ur textbook may not be right,btohqsg
but is deemed sufficient for ur syllabus,btohqsg
It's up to you if u want to do some real learning,btohqsg
Or you just want to pass exams,btohqsg
What you call yourself nitrate ion,btohqsg
You always get cancelled in ionic equations,btohqsg
Perhaps not for test for nitrates,btohqsg
not if u form some no2,btohqsg
actually should I do anything for uni before uni,btohqsg
I feel like I'm just stagnating rn,btohqsg
If you don't  just be prepared to get rekt by the bell curve,btohqsg
80/100 for finals but no A,btohqsg
Depends on what course uw ant,btohqsg
is there any way to prep for eng,btohqsg
Unless maybe you're some 42/42 IMO medalist,btohqsg
i hear all the horror stories,btohqsg
45/50 was the cut off for A-,btohqsg
3.5 GPA should be possible 🙃,btohqsg
I think people are just cheating,btohqsg
"Sorry i'm sensitive to ""ey"" cause jwts",btohqsg
Unless the paper was really easy,btohqsg
It was a face to face exam,btohqsg
what kind of course 45/50 is the cut off sia wth,btohqsg
kinda the reason why I want physical lectures,btohqsg
Gg time to die next yr HAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
If i dont get an A,btohqsg
I mean I'm not aiming for FCH la (esp with ddp) but like,btohqsg
"json web tokens  starts with json notation so ""{"" char but it's b64 encoded so it becomes ey",btohqsg
as long as it's second class I think is ok?,btohqsg
The average nus merit gets FCH,btohqsg
You become sensitive to such things when you do enough ctfs,btohqsg
can't be nus merit scholar means FCH what,btohqsg
Gpa is just a number guys,btohqsg
why do you have a circle of merit scholars,btohqsg
there's an exclusive scholar club meh,btohqsg
You need to increase your sample size and it has to be random,btohqsg
so good.. I also want school holiday tomorrow,btohqsg
75 percentile for A- kinda disgusting,btohqsg
So many times kena cucked alr cause missed by a little bit,btohqsg
Literally all my mods this year,btohqsg
I kinda let my guard down so oh well  careless mistakes ensued thereafter,btohqsg
Worse part is if NUS high students are taking ur module,btohqsg
They reduce the number of grades left for undergrads,btohqsg
they're graded on the same bell curve?,btohqsg
Doesnt make sense to separately grade anyway,btohqsg
I think still can clutch A-?,btohqsg
Cos impossible the same ppl 75th all tests,btohqsg
This mod i did last year,btohqsg
I was hoping for A- but bellcurve be like that,btohqsg
The grade cut off is determined by overall summation of each test's 75th,btohqsg
But as mentioned it doesnt make sense,btohqsg
But yeah also this? But generally the rlly good ppl should be consistent also,btohqsg
Rule of thumb is you count your own results if summation under 75th pct you go suck prof D maybe get A-,btohqsg
You v smart can one just consistent > 75 pct only ezclap,btohqsg
One of my finals most of the above 75th got rekted,btohqsg
I hope generally thats not the case,btohqsg
But generally is the case hehe,btohqsg
It's logical ma if you good you will do well lol,btohqsg
How many days do you have off,btohqsg
i have to go to poly on monday thurs and friday all 3 are 8am to at least 330pm in the afternoon,btohqsg
labor day isnt a school holiday for us afaik,btohqsg
Isn't that ok actually? U shudnt rly complain if u haven't seen mine :D,btohqsg
Source@RecurSkidcomplains abt my timetable being hell :D,btohqsg
I'm just sayingit would be nice if I can get one more school holiday LOL 🤣😅😅,btohqsg
well u shud think on the bright side tho,btohqsg
Poly y'all got more holiday then JC/sec during the sept iirc,btohqsg
You wont want to see it 🤣,btohqsg
Did that piercing parent got ban? Just curious,btohqsg
Got someone say he parent then ask very weird question de.,btohqsg
think we're just getting a lot of trolls lmao,btohqsg
Yep there was an Indian mum who was overly concerned about her son getting piercing + tattoo. And she was afraid of her son after doing all those he would become gay.,btohqsg
@iWannaHideinaHoleif u ever wanna see a hell timetable hmu HAHAH,btohqsg
It's 3 pages long :D and it's not even fully detailed yet 🥴👍,btohqsg
I wouldn't say  indian mom. I would just say troller.,btohqsg
I'm saying based on the name🥴🤷,btohqsg
Tbh no parent/mother will ask this kind of question.,btohqsg
Ya. Exactly. I mean sexual stuff. Like piercing on the nipple and the private area,btohqsg
>;( ur timetable making me feel unproductive,btohqsg
:> heheh I doing my next timetable soon tho :D,btohqsg
i need to see if its still as bad,btohqsg
Ah  u shd ask her den,btohqsg
Without seeing first hand u will nvr understand,btohqsg
sorry I seldom chat in English so I don't know some of shortened words😥,btohqsg
He asked in another chat group too. Troll lah,btohqsg
Not in any chat groups affiliated to this,btohqsg
Hmm okay I will leave it then,btohqsg
Asking girls to group for projects,btohqsg
jus make grp tgther then ask,btohqsg
What do you think of guys with dangling piercings (In sec sch vs in poly)?,btohqsg
I saw my friend’s brother with it the other day,btohqsg
If discipline master take their job v seriously then too bad,btohqsg
I only know jc can perm hair,btohqsg
But he going poly next year,btohqsg
I think its more of personality than outfit,btohqsg
like that i should be gangster,btohqsg
Doesnt some of ur mods give more than 25% As?,btohqsg
No idea  the curve can indeed be modified based on various factors but we're not privy to the exact implementation,btohqsg
Da gai da gai 75th pct is A- range,btohqsg
I see certain mods is around 30%,btohqsg
But don't know lah just assume the worst lor,btohqsg
Many more for to come for you,btohqsg
Guys w these are cute but not my type,btohqsg
Time to get A for H2 math. Which i think i gonna get a B or a C HAHAHA,btohqsg
Noble gases have weak interatomic forces and have lost boiling and melting point and dun hv to form bonds. Why is it that elements have to form bonds to have a higher boiling and melting point?,btohqsg
Its not bec of atomic bonds that lead to higher bp and mp,btohqsg
Its bec of stronger intermolecular/atomic forces of attraction,btohqsg
Then why noble gases have weak forces,btohqsg
Cuz like its stable alr  shldnt it want to stay stable?,btohqsg
They don't (usually) form bonds with other atoms,btohqsg
"When we say intermolecular/interatomic forces of attraction we mean the forces that's ""making"" the individual molecules ""stick"" together",btohqsg
It's different from the forces keeping the atoms in a molecule together,btohqsg
I understand but I dont understand,btohqsg
So whys the boiling point low,btohqsg
Should be it’s boiling point is low because it’s gas at room temperature,btohqsg
It’s a gas because of low BP  not that it’s low BP because it’s a gas,btohqsg
Cause noble gases have weak interatomic forces of attraction,btohqsg
Anyway I'm no Chem god lmao imma let@jianjun21do it,btohqsg
time to quit chemistry and go back to cs,btohqsg
isnt it cuz they are covalent bonds,btohqsg
Can ask you too since you’re partly neon,btohqsg
Nitrate has a q on noble gases,btohqsg
For every one hr I study I use 5mins phone so,btohqsg
Before u wait til 6.22 again,btohqsg
I am used to 3mins last time,btohqsg
Study 1h use phone for 5 mins,btohqsg
Ok u got a min left,btohqsg
Idk why am I even studying rn when uni not even here yet,btohqsg
You’re like a bus that comes every 1h,btohqsg
There are 2 major types of intermolecular forces  one of which depends on the size of the molecule/atom  another which depends on the charges in the molecule,btohqsg
Nth else I zao alr ah,btohqsg
Gg sry haha I didn't receive notif,btohqsg
Noble gases are monoatomic so it doesn't have a large electron cloud,btohqsg
So you don't get strong forces from the first type,btohqsg
Noble gases are also electrically neutral,btohqsg
So you also don't get much of the second type,btohqsg
Electron cloud size increases down the group  boiling points increase,btohqsg
But they are all stil gases at rt,btohqsg
Net result is that there's just not much intermolecular forces of attraction for noble gases,btohqsg
Mhm I think I get it,btohqsg
You'll learn the names of these types of attraction later on,btohqsg
✨ VOLUNTEERS NEEDED ✨Hi all Byte SG (https://www.byte.sg/) is looking for volunteers to help facilitate science and technology enrichment classes for underprivileged kids aged 14 and belowMore details📅 Around June onwards📍 Yishun💛 Every Thursday 6pm to 9pmSign up here:https://tinyurl.com/BYTEVOLUNTEER,btohqsg
Well it’s Kel hereu nid anyth,btohqsg
Isn't tis the hwk for nus,btohqsg
I wan play teach me hahaha,btohqsg
Jesus I'm remembering all the ptsd from homework and exam questions,btohqsg
Why are they not ur type?,btohqsg
Cuz I prefer soft guys HAHA,btohqsg
rising covid cases is really irritating,btohqsg
If there's no physical lessons then it's almost pointless to go like university orientations or RC/hall/hostels,btohqsg
Eh anybody from IP here heard of something called the bilingual scholarship,btohqsg
I heard that some Hwa Chong students were offered it but I’ve never heard of it,btohqsg
That’s the closest one that I heard of,btohqsg
But if it’s BSP why would they call it bilingual,btohqsg
Or is BSP just too long to pronounce,btohqsg
btw if any1 is in NUS,btohqsg
double counting mods means if a 4 mc mod overlaps with my grad requirements  means it becomes 8 mc total?,btohqsg
or the 8 mcs worth of mods is taken up by the 4 mc mod  freeing up 4 free mcs that i can use for a UE/mod etc?,btohqsg
uhh if ddp you include it inside both major's gpa calc,btohqsg
but it's just worth a flat 4mc,btohqsg
It means it's worth 4 MCs for each degree seperately,btohqsg
There's also a max to double counting so yep,btohqsg
but if your majors not very similar then shouldn't hit the limit,btohqsg
Is anyone able to access the polyclinic appointment page,btohqsg
No. I mentioned you just out of jest because Nitrate ion was asking about noble gases and your username has “neon” in it lol,btohqsg
hi guys! anyone here studies computer science / intends to study computer science and won't mind being interviewed for a school assignment?,btohqsg
hi anyone has either o lvl higher chinese marking scheme for composition or for h1 chinese,btohqsg
they don't disclose the marking scheme tho :_,btohqsg
If anyone needs help with proofreading or feedback for your uni appeals (if/when the appeal portal is open)  feel free to msg me!(for free ofc) :),btohqsg
Can you proofreading my EAE write-up for poly ??🥺🥺,btohqsg
Aa I would like some help with that too,btohqsg
Thank youuuuuuuuuu!!! Will send you once I finished itttt,btohqsg
Does anyone offer a service of teaching an entire syllabus in summary  🤡🥲,btohqsg
💀💀💀 HAHAHA we need pay sch fees,btohqsg
You pay or your parents pay,btohqsg
Still decreases the total wealth of the family tho,btohqsg
Plus they don't teach in summary,btohqsg
Cause u never ask them to,btohqsg
They will be happy to help,btohqsg
Yea the last teacher I visited seemed pissed,btohqsg
I think most teachers would be v happy that u want to learn,btohqsg
try to go for consultations w other teachers!!,btohqsg
Ok random qn  what do yall think abt consultation with chers from other classes haha,btohqsg
It's fine  but u should ask ur teacher first as a courtesy,btohqsg
As in u should consult your teacher first,btohqsg
If not helpful then yeah find someone else,btohqsg
At the end of the day the important thing is that u get useful consults,btohqsg
I mean   if the teacher taught u before ?,btohqsg
But I think u shud approach ur own teacher first,btohqsg
Because he or she teaches u   so they would know ur problems and standard better,btohqsg
But u can still try ? If the other Teachers is willing so,btohqsg
Yea agreed  other teachers shouldn't be first choice,btohqsg
If ur Teacher doesn’t answer ur questions maybe yes   because Like it’s not beneficial  but yes   still up to you,btohqsg
Cause then it makes your teacher look inept,btohqsg
ur teacher teach u mah   so will know better,btohqsg
Unless ur like me have a fear of that specific Cher,btohqsg
🤡 my chem cher once saw me consulting w another cher when she walked out of the staff rm,btohqsg
A bit awkward but on the other hand  cant be bothered  not much time left  right?,btohqsg
Just do a quick explanation to ur cher that the other cher happen to pass by so u ask him/her then,btohqsg
HiiiDid any of y’all sit for the maths AS paper today?,btohqsg
Are u taking the cambridge A level exam?,btohqsg
I am taking the AS math paper today too.,btohqsg
Any juniors nid ss tb/chem (pure) notes/bio (pure) tb ?,btohqsg
Cuz it's abt 3 typo book size ah,btohqsg
u wan deliver to me also can,btohqsg
I haven't clear for ages :',btohqsg
im too lazy to do my own notes lol,btohqsg
Guys chem or bio the best subject hehe,btohqsg
Ss geog or ss lit ?,btohqsg
I take pure geog   ss lit,btohqsg
So geog lit ss I can help,btohqsg
Actually most of us including me is not taking the cambridge A level exam,btohqsg

Do y'all think there is a chance of common last topic removal again? If the case rise again,btohqsg
Cuz my 'jr' is in edgefield and she is like worried abt it,btohqsg
Prob if full cb happens again,btohqsg
considering we have adapted to the pandemic,btohqsg
"so no ""excuse"" for CLT anymore",btohqsg
Kinda miss circuit breaker thou haha,btohqsg
stay at home all day and play,btohqsg
and in the end ur results suffer like me,btohqsg
It was OK at the start,btohqsg
Nearer to the end I even wanted to go back camp for one day,btohqsg
If I'm not gonna listen in class  I might as well not listen at home,btohqsg
u can always do statics at home,btohqsg
Why pass when u can fail,btohqsg
Tis is why phase 2 coming back,btohqsg
lucky my grp tuition size doesnt exceed 5,btohqsg
My class(students) be pranking me :!,btohqsg
Oh well I guess can save few thousands,btohqsg
not like i will either even if NUS begs me to,btohqsg
they only sponsor engineering scholars under ESP,btohqsg
When graduate work can cover within a year,btohqsg
not if you are studying in a sunset industry course,btohqsg
Even if you earn $1k/month technically can pay off,btohqsg
RC/hall is worth if u live far away,btohqsg
u can choose any hall u wanna stay if u are keen,btohqsg
I'm not that keen in hall,btohqsg
so easy 1 way ticket to the competitive halls,btohqsg
Might as well say Tekong further,btohqsg
Thought I blocked this group lmao,btohqsg
From 8 ppl become 5 ppl,btohqsg
How do i select ppl to remove from the grp,btohqsg
Then just say erm new covid guidelines,btohqsg
Before I send u binary go see ur chat,btohqsg
Ur pic w mask in uni,btohqsg
perhaps you have other groups with him where it's not blocked  since it's on a per individual basis,btohqsg
Hi can I check if anyone has o lvl comb bio/chem practical notes ?,btohqsg
Cs I take bio n chem,btohqsg
For chem it's mostly based on the Way rite,btohqsg
Anyone from rvhs can pm me ? I want to ask smth,btohqsg
Or anyone else can ans this qns for me,btohqsg
Why is ur school's H2 math standard the same as  H2 further math?,btohqsg
I thought NY has the hardest math papers lol,btohqsg
And I'm like is that even allowed??,btohqsg
"No acsi HL math is the hardest :""",btohqsg
H2 fm has to be taken with h2 math,btohqsg
Oki gimme 3 mins  I go look in my folder,btohqsg
u havent seen AJC math papers yet,btohqsg
I was hungry when I saw the qn,btohqsg
the only burger i know is this,btohqsg
I'll try it tomorrow if I nothing do,btohqsg
