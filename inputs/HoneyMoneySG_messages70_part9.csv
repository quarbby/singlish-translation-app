Anyone get reply from moomoo WhatsApp last week? In the past  they are quiet fast,btohqsg
Sharing that my friend got the $0.50 charge while using Amaze card at emart24. MCC is 5999,btohqsg
Hi. May I know where do u guys buy your gold,btohqsg
I am interested too. Investment gold or gold accessories?,btohqsg
Do you keep them at home or in bank deposit box?,btohqsg
Home.. You can have a safe at home too,btohqsg
Anyone managed to add money to your webull account successfully today to participate in the deposit promotion?I transferred via FAST at 840am  until now nothing credited.I have submitted a ticket to webull at 850am. Currently still pending status.,btohqsg
Did you send screenshot to Webull? Mine too awhile but forgot how long it was not immediate,btohqsg
Yup screenshot of payment slip and bank statement sent 850am. Have spoken to the client service manager  he/she say all good  will inform the team in charge to expedite.,btohqsg
My first experience with FAST is that the first transfer needs to be verified by their team. It took one business day for my case. DDA I think is faster as it does not need to be verified.,btohqsg
I did it this morning  was instant,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. I did $1 yesterday  it was instant too. Today transferred the balance  then need manual processing. Already got credited.,btohqsg
can consider i guess   just that it have currency risk. But i believe it will work,btohqsg
Depends on whether the bank excludes such spending  even if they don't exclude  only the installment amount charged to the cc during the qualifying period counts as qualified spending,btohqsg
Caution non SGD FD not FDIC insured but DBS is reliable so ok.,btohqsg
Means need to hold 40 days?@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
Do what the image tells you to do,btohqsg
Hi is it normal for banks to be asking for 3 months bank statements just to show salary crediting when i previously have sent pay slip and cpf contributions?Applying for hsbc revo btwâ€¦ this application have been on going for a month nowâ€¦,btohqsg
5999 is in the chargeable list,btohqsg
what a joke.. why should MCC 5999 be chargeable?!,btohqsg
Depends on your purpose.Jewellery i buy from SKPhysical Investment I buy from SilverBullion,btohqsg
Not grouped with base txn somemore ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Renew my paradise grp membership also MCC5999 and kena charge fee,btohqsg
Iâ€™m wondering why a convenience store register their MCC as Specialty Retail Store ðŸ«¤,btohqsg
for moomo new user promo  does this mean I can deposit 10k and withdraw 3k? since they allow 30% drop in assets. and i will still qualify?,btohqsg
tried also the amaze lock card to check mcc  the txn won't even go through amaze so not able to check,btohqsg
Whats the best card to use for dental?,btohqsg
Worth deposit money momo and subscribe Fullerton SGD fund? Interest is around 3.7%. Can redeem anytime,btohqsg
Anyone knows whatâ€™s the internet rate for UOB One saving account previously? Like the past 5 years?,btohqsg
As opposed to what other option? Moomoo takes about 1 working day to sell and maybe 0.5 working day to withdraw,btohqsg
Chocolate is better  instant withdrawal and get higher interest. Moomoo have to wait next 1-2 working days to withdraw.,btohqsg
Chocolate vs moomoo  I think I trust moomoo,btohqsg
Another possibility for instant withdrawal is wise interest account.,btohqsg
Will the interest rate be revised yearly?,btohqsg
Which is better moomoo or webull or any other brokerages?,btohqsg
Not Tiger if you trade SGX.,btohqsg
IBKR for US stocks  moomoo for Sg stocks.,btohqsg
try not to lock card amaze card directly.either lock your link card .or amaze wallet balance is less than what you should transaction (insufficient balance),btohqsg
Yes  no difference over at moomoo..except that they donâ€™t have the stupid custody fee if you stop trading for a quarter.,btohqsg
is Cash Management Accounts works the same as moneybull (webull)?,btohqsg
TIGER responded: If you want to avoid the fee charge and have no plan to trade in the SG market recently we can assist with your SGX sub-account closure. The SGX sub-account closure will not affect your trading activities in other markets  it will  reopen after one tradingactivity for SG stock,btohqsg
How about SGX stock dividends? Anything fees I need to watch out for? DBS Vickers comm is $11.77 for cash upfront trades which should be better for my dividend stocks held long-term.,btohqsg
Which is stupid  since some people just want to lump sum buy and sit back collect dividends. They close the account then my stock store where?,btohqsg
But that said  who knows if moomoo or Webull will also add on similar terms down the road? If youâ€™re intending on buying for the long term (>5 years)  I personally wouldnâ€™t touch the China brokers. Leave them for day trading/punting. Long term stocks put in locally established banks and brokers or IBKR.,btohqsg
For dividend stocks i will put CDP. For trading who should I go with?,btohqsg
Moomoo or Webull for SGX. For US  all are the same for now if you want lowest comms.,btohqsg
Webull cannot trade SGX stocks I think,btohqsg
Oo never realised that. I thought SGX was available since they have sgd funds on their moneybull program.,btohqsg
locked until 16th  released on 17th,btohqsg
Here just to rant .... but OCBC is getting quite ridiculous in their anti-money laundering practices. Was helping my Mum apply for premier banking as she has just received proceeds from recent property sale. The officer insisted that the sales agreement was not sufficient to prove source of funds  require the sales agreement of the previous property that was sold more than 18 years ago to purchase this property. Anyone knows if this is really the norm or did I just encounter an overly zealous banking officer?,btohqsg
