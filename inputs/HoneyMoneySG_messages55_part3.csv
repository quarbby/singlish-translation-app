HSBC Revo card... Where do I check the bill statement for the miles point accumulated?,btohqsg
Hello  saw someone asked a qn on using cpf/cashto pay for housing. I actually did a calculation (not sure if I calculated correctly)However  based on the calculation  I think its more worth to use cash to pay for house and transfer your OA amount to SA unless you can get a return of > 4% for your cash.If you pay using OA then top up to SA (you are getting 4% interest but you have to repay 2.5% accrued interest back to your own cpf so effectively you are just getting 1.5%(?)) I understand that accrued interest is paying the interest that you could have earned if you did not touch the CPF  back to your account.If you pay using cash  you can transfer OA to SA and get 4% interest.I did a quick calculation (not sure if im correct) but assuming i took a 230k loan for 25 years  the difference when im 55:If I used cpf:OA: $750k (CPF used for house +Accrued interest + my OA amount)Breakdown of $750kCPF Amount used: $450k (principal + interest)Accrued interest: $220k (I used basic calculation instead of compounding to make things simpler)OA amount : $80kIf I didn't use cpf:SA: $1.2m (based on 4%)Initial amount about $120k  OA contribution per month $18k for 28 years (i'm 27 this year)There is a $450k difference.Any thoughts on this?üòÖ,btohqsg

Hi  what card should I use in Australia?,btohqsg
Hi  I have ocbc 365  ocbc titanium rewards  and citibank cash back plus  and instarem. How to use my card to get the most benefit?,btohqsg
i think another thought/perspective to consider is - when do u want your retirement cash flow to kick in? Some would prefer to retire at 40 with 2k/mth vs retiring at 65 with 5k/mth (from a bigger portfolio  eg from that extra 450k difference). ‚ÄòWorth‚Äô is subjective since it depends on ur investment time horizon  financial goals and also how much u value time freedom. For some  1 year time freedom may be worth more than 450k hahaPersonally i feel 4% is fairly easy to beat unless u‚Äôre risk adverse.,btohqsg
If pay cash it is coming from your taxed income. If pay OA it is untaxed income. Also top up of MA/SA/SRS also got deduction. Think depends which aspect you are trying to maximise.,btohqsg
I tried transfering money to my moomoo account through the DDA fast transfer but doesnt get through. Is it cos its a weekend? I just opened my account.,btohqsg
I have booked a year end with travel agent. Still have a balance of 20K to pay up. Whickind of payment or card u guys think can I get the mos rebate?,btohqsg
Personally for me  I think 55 is quite a good age to retire and by then I will have about more than $700k that i can take out from CPF SA anytime. (I haven't include my monthly SA contribution . FRS for 2051 is $452k).SA is kinda risk free (only risk is if they change the 4%)It's true 4% is a relatively easy yield to hit but not for all.,btohqsg
So would you recommend topping up $8000 to SA and the rest to be paid by cash? Or still stand by full amount OA?I can still top up to SA $8k and pay by cash.The only con that I think of using cash is that my $ in SA are locked up till 55.. So if i need $ before 55  i can't touch my cpf.,btohqsg
It depends on which travel agent  some travel agents can earn more miles  some travel agent use monkey mcc which you won‚Äôt earn maximum benefits..,btohqsg
yup. Many many things can also change from 27 to 55. Heck  even my FI number changed multiple times over the last 4 years when i started my FIRE journey due to different perspectives on $. For ur case  I guess it‚Äôs a question of liquidity over the next 30 years vs ‚Äòrisk-free‚Äô returns if put into SA.Personally i would still leverage on using my CPF despite potentially having a bigger portfolio in the future since i value cashflow more than money being ‚Äòstuck‚Äô.,btohqsg
Anyone know if moomoo only accept top up of funds via same name account?,btohqsg
Yes. Or else think u money laundering,btohqsg
May I know  what about the video where Chris mention about not topping up more than $15000?,btohqsg
Confused by the reserved amount üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
Personally I‚Äôm doing 100% CPF  then top up MA then SA $8k  then the balance above that to SRS to invest (2x tax deduction overall). At least till hit FRS. I would say depends on your circumstances and if the house is a place to live or an investment. Depends how far away you are from 55. I‚Äôm Ang Moh PR with local wife/kids so my views on this might not be normal. My objective is not being forced to sell to fund retirement and no interest to get landed etc in SG.,btohqsg
What is the next best saving account that pays good interest yield and do not require salary crediting? (Exclude UOB one and HSBC EGA). Any higher than CIMB fast/star saver at 3.5% till end dec.,btohqsg
Hi  Im buying aircon on shopee worth $3000. Which card is best to use?,btohqsg
Citi rewards card can use for shopee?,btohqsg
$15k is just a ballpark figure. The whole idea is that SA top-ups (included compounded interests) for tax relief purposes are reserved and cannot be shielded at age 55.So given that at age 55  CPF rules also mandate that the first $40k cannot be shielded  this $15k is just computed from the breakeven whereby your SA top-ups (including 4% compounded interests) equate to $40k at age 55. All this comes with a big assumption that shielding hack is not plugged by CPF  and CPF rules do not change.,btohqsg
Yes  but the bonus point is cap at 1k spending,btohqsg
I see .. what a waste.If i use amex truecashback only 1.5% about $50,btohqsg
Hsbc advance will do as well,btohqsg
2.5 percent for 2k spending. Cap at 2.8k spend. Get 1 percent more if u fulfill the ega acct criteria,btohqsg
Use Digitbot method to check the Shopee mcc code if you plan to earn high miles. If the mcc code does not fall within the category  you earn less/base miles. Shopee uses multiple mcc codes n we won‚Äôt know which one Shopee uses for your transaction.,btohqsg

No need to pay accrued interest of Oa if you not sell the HDB,btohqsg
To me  it's all about discipline. Even the safest T-bill is now earning more than 2.5% OA. So if you want to maintain money in your OA for your next property purchase  the solution is to use CPF to pay now  and do a housing refund later when your cash yield drops. If you do not intend to purchase any more property  just transfer to SA.Considering all scenarios  using cash to pay now is the worst option  unless you are the type that cannot tolerate the temptation of seeing cash on hand.,btohqsg
Another consideration also is that once you transfer to SA and hit FRS  you no longer have the option of getting tax reduction via SA top-ups.,btohqsg
