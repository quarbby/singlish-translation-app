Good morning Hustlepeople !QOTD“In the blink of an eye  everything can change. So forgive often and love with all your heart. You may never know when you may not have that chance again”- Anonymous2020 has been a unprecedented. Hope COVID-19 will be defeated soon.Most of us fortunate to be Singaporeans and live in Singapore where the virus is pretty much contained. We must not forget that many others in the world have lost loved ones and are still suffering.As Bruce would say  “Under the sky  under the heavens  there is but one family”Everyone should focus on helping one another. Positivity promote more positivity!Anyways  It’s Does Feels like a medical rally is eminent. Vaccine related economic recovery and medical related counters should go hand in hand  not one or the other. Also  congrats GKE  Yinda and JT holders. Alas.Let’s see. Hope so. My favoured counters for this period.- Vicplas ($0.25)  PanUnited ($0.285)PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.,btohqsg
2020 has been a really good year for stocks as there are lots of new players due to WFH. With that many BBs came to play.With that  there is more movement and volatility which translate into more trading opportunities.Always bear in mind that mostly  stock market is just a game of wealth transfer  usually from the impatient to the patient / chasers to the early accumulators. Hence  always think about what you can do to become a better player in this game.Now  it’s the best time to take some time off  meditate and reflect on what went well or wrong and how one can do better going to trade in 2021.Also  trust me when I stress the daily reminder on the importance on SL. On an unexpected crash  it can and will wipe u out.The truth is the current economy is much worser than the times during the last few market crashes but stock market have not portrayed this. Thus  always be nimble and best to hold lesser positions.Good luck and god bless all!,btohqsg
Thanks dax for ur reminders and happy new to you too!,btohqsg
Definitely a good read. Well said bro. Cheers to 2021 👏🏻👏🏻🙌🏻👍🏻🎉🎉,btohqsg

Lately  there is this conspiracy theory going around... not sure how true is it  ???   just to share for your good read...As it goes...Recently   many people seem to confused with Beijing decision to nab Jack Ma. Jack Ma was credited as father of modernizing China from a fragmented world to a fully connected digitalized world via internet and transforming china into a cashless society. Surely he cannot be the bad guy.But what many people didnt know was Jack Ma’s Alibaba was actually 33% controlled by Softbank Japan and 22% by Wall street USA YAHOO finance  Jack Ma only have a meager 5.67% stakes in Alibaba. This China success story is actually a story repeat of proliferation of opium in 1840  but instead of opium  they were offering the poorest Chinese farmers  hard labor workers with easy financing to purchase luxury goods that they do not need such as iPhones (not huawei)  jeans  branded bags  shoes etc and also offering cheap loans to university students  bypassing banks .Jack Ma was actually a front man  helping the Americans and Japanese to skin the naive 1.4bil normal citizens with tons of luxury goods that they cannot afford  by offering them financing at 17.7% interest per annum. Many chinese young people were conned to sign up for the latest iphones with 12 months easy instalments but not 0% interest  instead they were getting slapped with 18% interest per annum. All the young Chinese hard earned money and the naive farmers  were sending boatloads of money to USA tech companies  wall street banks and Japanese softbank. Japan softbank was famous for making lots of wrong investments moves but still able to report record profit year after year  thanks to the traitor Jack Ma and his team  conned the public wealth and transferred it to the Japanese.Jack Ma hatred of CCP is do deep he even orchestrated the short selling of China A-shares with George Soros + Wall Street bankers in 2015  that almost caused china financial crisis. Jiang Zemin and Bo Xilai were part of the team too  that wanted to destroy Xi Jinping reign. That explains why the CCP after successfully defended the market in 2015  launched a series if high profile probe into the highest ranking china CCP officers and thrown them to jail  and Xi Jinping consolidated his power by naming himself unchallengable president. It was needed to destroy the traitors within the party. But amazingly Xi didnt punish Jack Ma in 2015  many think the reasons were because Jack Ma was still needed to reform China digitally.Fast forwarded to today  China govt already owned now the best digital payment platform in the world  with help of Wall Street and SoftBank  2 largest financiers in the world . Jack Ma was so arrogant that before Ant IPO that may attract up to $30 billions at opening lambasted China govt as backward and claiming Alibaba is ready to replace them. But he didnt know that was the excuse Xi Jinping needed to foil his IPO party. 48 hours before IPO and on the day Trump was busy with USA ELECTION  CHINA GOVT announced suspending the Ant service IPO catching everyone by surprise  and JacK Ma was detained ever since without any mean of communication  until today.Jack Ma was a traitor all along.His success is not attributed to his hardwork  but his willingness to sell the country and use his network to connect external threat with internal opportunists that hated the CCP.His fate remained unknown but usually what happened to traitors is that they are thrown in jail for 20 - 100 years. We dont know how Jack Ma will ended up in.,btohqsg
