not worth taking job over there  Especially those branded stuff (i see many),btohqsg
as u can see parking already taken all your $$$,btohqsg
TUAS south jobs are for Taxi drivers or PHV as they can pick up jobs. Not for normal car or motorcycle. Basically one way trip.,btohqsg
i had to carry 4 cartons from MBS to its Westgate outlet. that time forgot to bring trolley. so i have to carry 1 box at a time from the shop to the car. i checked where the shop is  and where is the best place to park the nearest.i did the most troublesome method of going in and out of MBS carpark 4 times to avoid $7.49 first hour.but when i reach westgate - only $1.40 - give la.,btohqsg

Super irritating Sia cannot see past 11am...,btohqsg
Guys... For oddle order  the instruction is do not call for confirmation...,btohqsg
U can call if u want,btohqsg
But if never call can ask for cancellation fee? If shop close? Angry sia,btohqsg
Cs will say u nvr call,btohqsg
But some oddle resto u call also no answer the phone 1üòÇ,btohqsg
Which resto? I kena b4 reach then closed liaoüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
But 1 word of advise. If its an immediate order n u saw the order was supposed to be delivered very early but cos they couldn't get driver. Then make sure u call b4 gg to collect. Sometimes the order has been picked up already but job not cancelled in llm app. Either the resto nvr inform oddle to cancel  or oddle nvr cancel yet,btohqsg

Do you know how much USDT worth right now! If you don't want to live with worry  you can sell USDT as possible as you can. You can exchange it with ETH or BTC in return for that. Message me!,btohqsg
This chat is for Lalamove or investment?,btohqsg
I kena once at Tampines Mall a Chinese restaurant. When i arrived there  i looked under my ongoing  suddenly the job was gone. The restaurant's manager said job cancelled then said someone collected the order. Knn  i incurred carpark charges for nothing,btohqsg
I still call. Sometimes  the address given in the apps is not complete,btohqsg
Spent lots of time searching for the address at  Malls. And also many times  the apps don't give complete address. The apps navigation brings me to wrong location,btohqsg
I just call if its a rescue order,btohqsg
As in very long liao but no driver take the order,btohqsg
Just in case it was cancelled or they found other drivers but nvr update by resto or oddle,btohqsg
If its advanced order or immediate order but very near to original scheduled pickup time I don't call just go straight,btohqsg
Hihi am new to lalamove and this is my first time cashing out,btohqsg
If I cashout now when will I get the month into my bank account?,btohqsg
Okok thanks for reply really appreciate üòä,btohqsg
Means I will get only next Wed then,btohqsg
Just to ask any idea how to avoid prank orders call the receiver first before proceeding to collect?,btohqsg
So far I did 6 deliveries so far so good üòä,btohqsg
do credit orders. or orders that u commonly see in the app. like oddle or medicine or deliverchinatown or some florist. usually these orders are corporate accounts and are generally more trustworthycash orders u can proceed if there is sufficient information in the remarks. call before proceeding.do some more  get the feel  then you will find your sweet spot when doing LLM and not be a random cherry picker not knowing anything.,btohqsg
If I were took an order which has 4 stop  must I follow in sequence or can I plan my own route,btohqsg
And what does it means by contact customer for additional expense?,btohqsg
150kg should suffice for most of the car jobs.,btohqsg
Stick to the route.. if u r stacking  got to judge the timing. As llm will track the timing to each location i think,btohqsg
"hello fellow lalamovers  wondering if anyone delivered for this client before? name in the app is Teemu  pick-up from a storage facility in chai chee. was unclear with his pick-up instructions (did not leave the notes under remarks)  has an incredibly thick and difficult foreign accent  and got mad at me when i couldn't understand him (""what is wrong with you  i don't understand why this is so difficult for you""). yikes!",btohqsg
did not provide clear pick-up instructions  left the parcel unattended at an obscure location  and i'm the crazy one! hahahaha,btohqsg
ü•≤ totally ruined my night sia  heng he say sorry,btohqsg

hahaha true true! if not will do until kisiao,btohqsg
Anyone experience having a job automatically in your cancelled list...?I dun remember accepting and I dun remember requesting for cancellation,btohqsg
Weirdly  somehow  I even drop off...,btohqsg
I told customer service I dun recall this job  they deduct $4 and suspend me for a day...,btohqsg
Not that I mind these penalty  but it's just mind boggling how these can happen....??? Its like I am wondering if I am the one who has gone insane...,btohqsg
Has these happen to anyone before?,btohqsg
I am pretty sure somehow is their tech issue  but how to proof???,btohqsg
