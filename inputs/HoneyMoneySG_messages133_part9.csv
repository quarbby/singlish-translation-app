Good morning! I'm thinking of applying for a UOB card to go with my UOB One account. Do you have any recommendations on which card might be the best fit for me? I'd really appreciate your advice!,btohqsg
Most people go for ladies card if u want miles,btohqsg
Also subject to your spending  lady card only 1 category bonus miles,btohqsg
Can you share the full promo link? Is it either 500$ or 25k miles?,btohqsg
Morning  I have a pending transaction of $10+ from grab since 16 sep. I spent $492 this month. I just need that transaction to clear to get my UOB One bonus interest. Since today last day  is there any place to spend that update within same day?,btohqsg
Spent or posted $492? Suggest to spend $500 minus posted as of later when purchasing to be safe.,btohqsg
did you confirm the 492 against the one account details? it will tell you if you have completed the different phases,btohqsg
Here you go the T&C :https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/premier/offers/welcome-reward-promotion-and-referral-programme.pdfYes  it‚Äôs option to choose $500 or 25k miles   if keep $100k for 3 months.,btohqsg
Posted 492 on the tracker. Usually it took max 6 days from pending to posted.. but not sure why this haven't clear in 2 weeks,btohqsg
Maybe you can double check if the grab trip was actually cancelled/no ride found?,btohqsg
For UOB singsaver new to UOB card.. how long do I have to cancel my card before I can get the new to UOB status?,btohqsg
It's grabfood actually.. it's reflected as pending.. if let say I don't meet the amount  possible to appeal?,btohqsg
On grab the order went through also right? Unlikely to appeal  stated clearly on t&c already. Not UOB fault they won't help one.,btohqsg
Oh yes your one most important,btohqsg
If anyone is wondering  it's because original poster (OP) asked a question and deleted it afterwards. The community has replied graciously. So admin will post what was being asked for the community to have a full picture of what is happening.Bottomline  don't delete your questions after asking  even if you feel it was a bad question. Someone will catch it anyway,btohqsg

Good day all  may I check how you guys invest for kids? Esp if have 2 or more kids  shld invest individually or combine?,btohqsg
What is ur idea of investing for kids?,btohqsg
Are you setting money aside for your kids and putting them in ETF? If you had ur kids' expenses covered (food  schooling  tuition)  I think it's not bad.,btohqsg
My personal approach is not investing for kids  but give them the right/suitable environment to thrive and make money on their own. Teach them good skills and encourage them. Let them learn about money from young.Then for investment  make sure you do good for yourself first. Don't worry about kids,btohqsg
Hello all  anyone knows what are the mcc for tyre workshop?,btohqsg

EGA and MMF are two different financial product. One is saving account/current account n the other are investment. Nobody will compare these two.,btohqsg
