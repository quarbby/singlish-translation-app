Car Review - Skoda Scala 1.0 TSI Style (A) üìùFrom those 'simply clever' features to the generous space afforded in the cabins of all its models  Skoda has long taken pride in offering high-value vehicles to its customers.This latest variant of the Scala continues this tradition  thanks to its 1.0-litre engine and astute 109bhp output  which allow it to duck under the limits set for cars to be registered here with a Cat A COE  bringing the already attractive asking price of the hatchback even lower still.‚û°Ô∏è Read ithere!,btohqsg
