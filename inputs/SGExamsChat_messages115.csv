Reddit mods cannot view deleted posts also,btohqsg
Oh well that post is lost to history then haha,btohqsg
But somehow the link preview shows a snippet of the post?,btohqsg
It was sent at the time when the post had yet to be removed,btohqsg
Hmm maybe Google has a cached version of it,btohqsg
Jesus OK yeah the poster was really entitled lol,btohqsg
Goes to show nothing is ever deleted off the internet lol,btohqsg
Lol  whoever wrote that is just salty af and needs to git gud,btohqsg

Have not decided yet. Why u choose gamsat ?,btohqsg
I'm not from science background leh.,btohqsg
Gamsat will be easier for nonscience majors,btohqsg
I hope you don’t find that to be an issue,btohqsg
I thought is some white knight 😂🙊,btohqsg
I shouldn't drink so much coffee hahaha,btohqsg
On the internet anyone can be who they want,btohqsg
One could be a man pretending to be a woman as well,btohqsg
Lol omg gender and sexual orientation fluidity save me that hahaha,btohqsg
Woman pretend as man more common la given sexism,btohqsg
@junghon3709why I dont see u in the pic,btohqsg
That's because I'm not in the project,btohqsg
I just know he was a sexual predator,btohqsg

I wish I chose science but maybe I am being practical la. Sg science industry still very small leh,btohqsg
Can consider do MD PhD if u want also,btohqsg
I mean the salaries stuck at quite low for some reason idk why,btohqsg
Not as big as USA UK. Not as advanced also,btohqsg
I'm doing a double degree SMU/Duke NUS.,btohqsg
I still have to sit for GAMSAT though,btohqsg
Are you in yr final year?,btohqsg
I'm thinking of doing LLM but I am not sure if i can disrupt. Duke says the 4 years has to be back-on-back and suggested if I wanna do Masters I study it before starting the medicine phase.,btohqsg
Anyway I heard gamsat is quite easy like mostly JC level stuff... hope I can do it 🙈,btohqsg

Anyway just PM me if u wanna group study cya😊,btohqsg

Latest uni rankings out amid calls for halt due to Covid-19https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/latest-uni-rankings-out-amid-calls-for-halt-due-to-covid-19?utm_source=STSmartphone&utm_medium=share&utm_term=2020-06-10+17%3A16%3A45,btohqsg
NUS remains in 11th position while NTU has slipped to 13th position.,btohqsg
NUS and NTU game the rankings heavily,btohqsg
That's why they managed to get themselves ranked above many Ivy League universities,btohqsg
Heard NTU is ranked higher in engineering and chem than nus,btohqsg
Why do u think profs are graded heavily based on research,btohqsg
Prof ability to get tenure is 99% dependent on research,btohqsg
Not as much. Their teaching feedback get 4.0 enough,btohqsg
Yea but just for reference only,btohqsg
Is anyone ready for block exams?,btohqsg
Guys this is a random question,btohqsg
To be fair  I don't think Einstein was an excellent teacher,btohqsg
Anyone plays volleyball in local u here? Is the level of play high?,btohqsg
Like high to the extent that a complete novice cannot even warm the bench by the end of 4 years,btohqsg
He was one of the worst teacher in fact,btohqsg
yall obviously nvr met my encik,btohqsg
Which is why I think it's just an unfortunate industry standard where professors are expected to be both excellent teachers and researchers,btohqsg
Professors can actually be excellent teachers  it is more like uni penalise them for prioritising teaching over research,btohqsg
Hence most dont bother teaching well,btohqsg
Mhm  that's an institutionalised problem as well I suppose,btohqsg
Is it the $50 note flush down the toilet one?,btohqsg
i cant believe the dude did that,btohqsg
Can I use this as evidence to say that RI students all rich,btohqsg
Teaching quality  not necessarily Ivies are amazing too,btohqsg
Isn’t it illegal to deface currency,btohqsg
It is  but guess which DPP wants to charge a retarded child,btohqsg
Court probably has no time for this shit,btohqsg
If you mean the public  sure.,btohqsg
But if you talk about field-specific stuff big no,btohqsg
? specific organisations always publish their own rankings,btohqsg
It almost seems like conflicting skillsets to me;Being able to simplify and break down concepts for beginners as a teacher and being able to grasp and answer complex questions being asked in those thesises as a researcher.,btohqsg
The Shanghai one is published by the Shanghai one,btohqsg
QS is published by the same org  etc.,btohqsg
Actually communication is a core skill in research. Now I just need someone to communicate to me how arrows upon arrows can prove ABC Conjecture is true or how its supposed proof does not hold,btohqsg
oh god what did i step into,btohqsg
did i come into this chat at the wrong time,btohqsg
Being able to communicate with your fellow researchers is a different skillset from being able to communicate to your average student  wouldn't you say?,btohqsg
Somewhat yes and no? In either case you assume your audience to have some kind of common knowledge and build upon it.,btohqsg
Yeah  and the kind of common knowledge that a professor and a university student has  is vastly inferior to the common knowledge that fellow professors have,btohqsg
But if you knew your audience's common knowledge is it that ridiculous to expect you know how to teach for that given knowledge?Obviously IRL a professor doesn't exactly know what the audience's knowledge is.Most egregious examples of bad teaching come from weird assumptions of knowledge.E.g.  when asked 'what an example of a Banach Space ' a professor replied the dual space of a Banach space is an example of a Banach Space. (about as useful as saying that the dual cone of some set X is an example of a cone),btohqsg
This example is a great example of weird assumption of knowledge,btohqsg
Should I buy iphone 11 now or wait for iphone 12,btohqsg
Who are you  so wise in the ways of science,btohqsg
The carbonara samyang is the only one i can tolerate the spice,btohqsg
The cheese one had no difference with the normal samyang. The cheese ratio to the sauce is like 1:5,btohqsg
I think the term is elitist*,btohqsg
As long as they don't charge an ITE student for doing the same it's fine,btohqsg
If they do someone confirm will remember this case lol,btohqsg
I thought this was an ad,btohqsg
"Any ""ad"" posted by ad-mins is ""ironic"" therefore ""not an ad""",btohqsg
"As ad-mine we are immune to all claims that we post ""ads""",btohqsg

Is this you? Is this you when you see this image? Is this you now? Is that hoe you reacted when you saw this image? Is this really the look on your face when you glanced at the message?,btohqsg

The anime girl and the pepe,btohqsg
I can totally imagine him setting pepe as his profile pic,btohqsg
He's a weeb he can set the top one too,btohqsg
The smiley lets him evade suspicion of being a weeb,btohqsg
Oh I didn't know he watches anime,btohqsg

Straits Times Index is crashing again,btohqsg
U could always put $500 a month into some investment fund,btohqsg
Overtime compound interest will do its magic,btohqsg
Not good idea as commission will eat up,btohqsg
Unless you are looking at far term  the upside is 30%-50%. $500 becoming $750 I guess  then minus commission of $20 or so.,btohqsg
Surprised that many people investing tens of thousands during COVID-19. You can actually see sums invested on FSMOne.,btohqsg
The market is already 30% recovered  while US market has 100% recovered  so if you want can enter now if prices go down a little bit 😁,btohqsg
Yeah good time to invest more money inside.,btohqsg
Both can work ah. Timing can also earn money. Day traders is an example  but not much money I guess about $80000 USD/year?,btohqsg
The market historically grows 6%++ a year.,btohqsg
How to do well for EL compre?,btohqsg
The answers like so inflexible one,btohqsg
The answers I think of are like so close yet so far,btohqsg
yes but I'm dying in camp,btohqsg
PM me I'll reply u when I bookout,btohqsg
You never get this for any other subject,btohqsg
Is this a reference or am I reading too much into it,btohqsg
Is the SG stock exchange still going to go down tmr? Any thoughts,btohqsg
no one told me this chat had a crystal ball,btohqsg
Exams in this chat not investing 😔,btohqsg
Currently it has been rallying up and this rally looks alittle extended. look at STI for refrence. it might actually drop a little when hitting a resistance and it might actually continue going up in the long term as companies and the economy is being opened up.,btohqsg
Yall can pm for that 😂,btohqsg
my mental state has been deteriorating since the day I booked in,btohqsg
Hey guys  is there any information systems majors here from SMU? im going into year 1 and was wondering if any of yall had any extra notes that you will be kind enough to share for freshies,btohqsg
Just put ur money and dont look,btohqsg
hahah but please do your research before investing,btohqsg
But no point timing the market,btohqsg
all about getting at a better value,btohqsg
If enough people report him he’ll get deleted for spam,btohqsg
I rmb getting flyers frm this tuition centre,btohqsg
pretty fucking if you ask me 😒,btohqsg
Did you get the messages as well?,btohqsg
just change your privacy settings lor,btohqsg
He pmd me some Google forms link,btohqsg
I’m running a bot now that fills in junk data,btohqsg
More reasons why discord is superior,btohqsg
Should apply for sgexams tech team,btohqsg
just because you won the nitro giveaway,btohqsg
Pretty sure lots of dudes got it,btohqsg
Scroll up for ideas on what to do,btohqsg
I just googled how to spam google form and research lor,btohqsg
Speaking of which  a bot that gave free replies would have been great for faking PW results,btohqsg
Instead we had to do it by hand,btohqsg
“We sent out a survey on blah and received 1000000 responses”,btohqsg
Not even create the survey and say you received 100000 responses,btohqsg
Totally not what my group did,btohqsg
We are upstanding students of substantial moral character,btohqsg
My group mate was a IOI medal winner,btohqsg
how does that link to this,btohqsg
But people study 'to get a good job' and why? 'To get money' CHECKMATE FLAT EARTHERS,btohqsg
He made a script to fill up the Google form,btohqsg
i rmb watching a vid on how some guy maxed out his CPF SA/Medisave at 30+ yesterday  quite interesting,btohqsg
I too enjoy get rich quick schemes,btohqsg
its just prudent and smart life tactics,btohqsg
Unfortunately if your money is in CPF SA I don't consider you very rich,btohqsg
But 'give govt money schemes' are always well appreciated by certain parties,btohqsg
Bedok is venturing into article writing,btohqsg
Watch out for his next article on life as a uni Chem student stuck in a Sec 5 person’s body,btohqsg
Anyone who wishes to go to ACJC is obviously wise,btohqsg
Pyramid schemes are nice. That's why insurance as an industry is doing well,btohqsg
Wait what is this ACJC advertising!? BAN,btohqsg
When you say EJC > ACJC what kind of ordering are you imposing,btohqsg
Whoever dont want to swim shouldnt go acjc,btohqsg
It’s ok just get medical exemption,btohqsg
When there’s a will there’s a way,btohqsg
Cause they have compulsory swimming lessons,btohqsg
Wtf why do they get all the cool stuff,btohqsg
Swimming is a pride for ACS,btohqsg
a = str('EJC')b = str('ACJC')While len(a) < len(b):print(a),btohqsg
I'll take that as a yes,btohqsg
I suppose ejc campus is nicer,btohqsg
"Any RI elites want to share how they are ""pablic aenimee numba wan""https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h0ric8/rant_stop/",btohqsg
"""Hey dude it's ITE LUL""""Yeah thankful I studied hard never go ITE""vs.""Hey dude it's RI LUL""""WTF I FEEL SO ATTACKED""#itsnotokifigetattacked",btohqsg
There is some truth to this though,btohqsg
Which is why some RI people don’t like to say they’re from RI,btohqsg
And how is this a bad thing,btohqsg
It sucks to not be able to be proud of your skool in public,btohqsg
Wat would life be like if I couldn’t shill for ACJC at every opportunity,btohqsg
How not to be proud? 3 words bro Lee Kuan Yew,btohqsg
Which will have answers resolving all these conundrums!!!!!!!!!!!!!,btohqsg
A lot of minister come from RI,btohqsg
If only come from more humble backgrounds sia,btohqsg
You can both be from a humble background and be from RI,btohqsg
CCS is from a single parent household and grew up in a three room flat,btohqsg
I wonder if they have a political inner circle in RI,btohqsg
Could u pm me a link,btohqsg
No matter where you are  whether JC  poly or back alley  if you can find friends and people that you trust and bring them together for a common goal  you can do something big:),btohqsg
"I'm not from RI but surely RI is not just some magic place where ideas float into people's heads like ""this is the politics place"" haha",btohqsg
Not just politics  anything else... just my random night time epiphany that you don't have to be somewhere else in order to do what you want,btohqsg
I guess they got the psc  SAF or spf scholarship to climb the political ladder,btohqsg
"Haha ok lah  granted... some professions are just more ""exclusive"" because of all the barriers to entry",btohqsg
Like scholarships and inside circle stuff with ministers,btohqsg
how does one effectively do that,btohqsg
My GP tutor was once nominated as an NMP... it was a very arbitrary process tbh they just picked him and told him to go for some secret interview,btohqsg
umm... be a nice person who can stand on your own and be enthusiastic about whatever you're doing  look for people in the right places (subreddits) and naturally you get some? Hahah,btohqsg
Said GP tutor is not just any ah mao ah kow haha but yeah  the process is really like that,btohqsg
haha i have like 2 close friends whom i consider actually real and i alr consider myself lucky,btohqsg
how to even get a group of that,btohqsg
"Tbh I nvr liked the idea of a ""best friend""",btohqsg
I don't think I can teach life skills by telegram HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
I don't really care for best friends and being overly clingy  I'm happier when I know that all the people I surround myself with are genuine folks who I can depend on and who will count on me when they need it,btohqsg
I guess that's the best description I can come up with haha,btohqsg
thats why i know u cant have more than 5 genuine friends at a time,btohqsg
true that there are alot of snakes out there,btohqsg
but I'm guessing that most people don't actually set out to be snakes to everyone they meet haha,btohqsg
if they do  guess I'm one naive child,btohqsg
"if only relationships could be explained by diagrams:"")",btohqsg
it just that its quite impossible to keep depth of friendship for many people at a time,btohqsg
we only have 24 hours in a day and responsibilities to handle,btohqsg
"but basically my point is... if you're interested in things like arts or politics or whatever ""inacessible"" ""elite"" career  and you think that only if you to go this JC or this uni then you can dare to think of it",btohqsg
to keep that many friends you'd have to dedicate your entire life to it,btohqsg
Know that there are probably 20 other people in your cohort who thinks the same way,btohqsg
I have batchmates in law sch,btohqsg
And my jc wasnt considered good,btohqsg
I turned down comp law also,btohqsg
My jc not proven yet  must wait for us to hit like 5 year track record then say,btohqsg
We dont even have any working alumni,btohqsg
All our grads still in y2 uni or NS,btohqsg
The first batch did much better than RI,btohqsg
i think you mean those people are your allies  not your 'friends'  they are people you socialise with and share a common goal with  not actually 'friends',btohqsg
hahah the first batch are legends,btohqsg
Maybe first batch is the outlier,btohqsg
our batch legit gonna ruin it all just saying,btohqsg
if so easily call ppl friends then im a fucking social butterfly alr,btohqsg
Grades aren’t the only thing that defines a skool,btohqsg
no shade but... our teacher compared our year by year grades,btohqsg
If a swimming pool defines acjc  ok,btohqsg
Everyone knows about ACJC because of you and your smiley,btohqsg
yup  I wish grades didn't define us,btohqsg
And ACJC is a subset of ACS,btohqsg
But we aren’t actually that good at it,btohqsg
Grades don't define us  they just close certain doors,btohqsg
In fact our sports isn’t really all that gret,btohqsg
We get distinction every SYF for every performing arts but one,btohqsg
And those certain doors ultimately are places that can potentially shape who we are,btohqsg
Tbh I'm here to rant about performing arts and entertainment industry again HAHA,btohqsg
The good thing is that they are doors; they can be opened (with luck and attitude),btohqsg
You literally cannot starve to death in Singapore  so as long as you persevere  you can make something out of life.,btohqsg
You can't magically have time squeezed out,btohqsg
my parents business making over 10k loss a month cuz of covid,btohqsg
Mm you most definitely can but we do have measures in place to help people should they want to take it,btohqsg
A lot of times you have stubborn people who don't want to take gov/social service agencies' support,btohqsg
wow so people's failure is their own fault,btohqsg
I've been working on a pilot project  starting up a kind of small community that promotes filmmaking and drama/theatre... my goal is to brighten the creator culture in SG. I invite aspiring local artists  actors and anyone else who is serious about pursuing the arts to join a networking telegram group where there's a lot of collaboration opportunities and also discussion on artistic/dramatic techniques,btohqsg
Yes  sometimes people fail because of their own faults,btohqsg
Like those cardboard sellers  I used to volunteer to visit and chat with elderly folks and there are so many instances of them refusing our help,btohqsg
Hope it goes well  the filmmaking scene in Singapore seems more like propaganda on how to be a better citizen to me lol,btohqsg
yup  that's what i want to change,btohqsg
Instead of those propaganda mills  how about actual films that keep our brain cells intact,btohqsg
At least it doesnt require commitment cause why on Earth would u want to watch that,btohqsg
Anyway if y'all are interested you can dm me anytime,btohqsg
@tinygreenstoneThat's an incredibly ambitious project  all the best to you,btohqsg
We're about two weeks old and already 25 members  all highly motivated arts career people who I know will go far  because the energy in that group is amazing,btohqsg
Yeah so if you put effort into finding time  you will find a lot of it,btohqsg
You know this is repeated only because it is true  right? Not that itactuallymeans more than anything that is required to be true,btohqsg
It's also repeated because it emphasises the system of meritocracy which we uphold and cherish in Singapore...,btohqsg
Credits to the person who set that question,btohqsg
A good propaganda mill actually keeps your brain intact,btohqsg
Oh that's quite cool  when did you start this project?,btohqsg
I've been planning and working on something like that for months  but I finally got things started for real 2 weeks ago,btohqsg
"Ah yes the 10k-years-old strategy of ""the weak should fear the strong""",btohqsg
Clearly not here to use this group productively,btohqsg
how is tinder such a terrible app,btohqsg
people below your league hit up on you and expect you to serve them like they're royalty,btohqsg
Guys can I still change my appeal course for nus?,btohqsg
i create a girl profile with a 10/10 girl with perfect looks,btohqsg
People who are in ivy league do not even need tinder but got many suitors from social media and irl😚,btohqsg
proof that tinder guys are entitled af,btohqsg
and my guy friends agree w me,btohqsg
Lol I dont even know anyone using tinder... anyway I'm attached 😅,btohqsg
also ivy league doesnt mean shit?,btohqsg
it jsut means you're a good rule follower and was lucky your whole life,btohqsg
I guess you need to chill and be more positive instead of toxic,btohqsg
imagine dating people cuz of their education status tho,btohqsg
the whole concept of leagues is a bit wonky,btohqsg
i only date my bed sorry,btohqsg
"as drake said ""i only love my bed and my mama im sorry""",btohqsg
i was confessed to by no one 🤡,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure straight guys don't have a lot of matches just cause of the demographics,btohqsg
ive grown to realise telegram = tinder,btohqsg
Straight girls can be choosy on tinder,btohqsg
clearly guys are also very choosy,btohqsg
And if they're below your league you should match with them..?,btohqsg
Even i don't have setting option in my mobile,btohqsg
Anyway I'm of the opinion tinder doesn't really work,btohqsg
to prove to my friends tinder are shit for girls,btohqsg
tbh its bad to go to tinder cos ur deadass despo,btohqsg
thats why i create fake acc,btohqsg
but trolling is ok and fun,btohqsg
i have and will never download a dating app,btohqsg
screenshot proof to my clique to show how shit tinder is for girls,btohqsg
@meltedmangofrappehey the girls hmu first not the other way,btohqsg
I knew my partner from online and it's been 3 years but it's not tinder Lol,btohqsg
But tbh too tired to do so,btohqsg
but srs my tele is usually for just my close group of friends or work,btohqsg
"He meant ivy league as in ""ivy league of looks""",btohqsg
Ivy league in general la but I guess tinder is based more on looks isnt it?,btohqsg
Then youre looking for the wrong kind of person,btohqsg
i dont think anyone cares abt bio on tinder,btohqsg
A little silly to swipe based on looks and bio 😐,btohqsg
A 6.5 or a 6 has a good chance if the bio matches the girls interests,btohqsg
u can insult a race on tinder bio and be good looking and get more matches,btohqsg
It sure is  but thats also the allure,btohqsg
unless that guy/girl really damn despo,btohqsg
But to swipe is a little crude. maybe online catalogues based systems are  better,btohqsg
so ur saying caring abt personality more than looks is despo?,btohqsg
I think there are matchmaking sites like that!,btohqsg
He's saying if you ignore looks on first impressions you're desperate,btohqsg
I made sure I saw my current gf pics first before we met and I do agree it was looks first at that time but subsequently personality and work ethic and outlook on life long and short term matters a lot,btohqsg
dunno man probably more for guys,btohqsg
guys care abt looks first  everything else comes later,btohqsg
Like I was initially apolitical until recently been converted to pro Pap by her,btohqsg
Everything is subjective. For guys and for girls,btohqsg
I've had a couple of failed rs and  so ... personality does matter,btohqsg
Surprisingly there are many toxic people around...,btohqsg
Do looks not matter for females?,btohqsg
if a girl is ugly doesnt matter if she has a perfect personality  they wont consider,btohqsg
That is sadly true  and for the reverse too,btohqsg
Tinder is literally a platform where looks come first,btohqsg
but afterwards it becomes less impt,btohqsg
"I mean in a way  it depends ah... occasionally there are guys who see something beautiful in a conventionally ""ugly"" girl",btohqsg
It's not smart to expect anything else when you look at its design. So i dont get why people dislike it so muchbecauseof it,btohqsg
Why you so judgemental... looks are subjective to an extent srsly,btohqsg
Why people suddenly talk about tinder,btohqsg
human beings are inherently judgemental  if one doesnt have judgement they will die cuz they dunno poop from food,btohqsg
I don't think I can ever consider someone truly ugly just by looking at their face. Like if it's extreme examples like acid attack I might be shocked but that's as I said an extreme example,btohqsg
"To an extent we never really think of  dating others cos we somehow put a premium on ""assets"" and sexual chemistry 😐 gotta admit I am also being judgemental but many singaporeans fall short of certain standards haha",btohqsg
Tbh I don't think I'll be able to date another person,btohqsg
My personality makes me more of a single kind,btohqsg
Sometimes I just prefer to be alone,btohqsg
Yeah like when it's time to be social I can talk,btohqsg
But usually I'd prefer not to,btohqsg
Anyway the topic has come up before  I'm not actually interested in dating anyone haha... I like being single too,btohqsg
I mean if you know why then it's all good,btohqsg
I do actually consider myself ace,btohqsg
Maybe at most grey ace but yeah,btohqsg
Long term outlook is important. Like both of us are really interested in scientific research 😂,btohqsg
u see  there's a reason why babies are all universally cute  cuz then parents parental instincts kick in to tkae care of them  ratio  symmetry and beaty are all objective things,btohqsg
Is she the best looking? Nah but I think easily top 30% hahah. If u consider assets then maybe top 10% 😂,btohqsg
I dont find babies cute personally,btohqsg
"I used to say aro ace but then I didn't want to restrict myself too much so I let myself go with a ""lets see what happens"" approach haha",btohqsg
I not ace I just not excited at the prospects of it all,btohqsg
