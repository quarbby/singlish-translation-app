We have the Edgy trilogy  Cherry Bomb & The Love trilogy,btohqsg
Cherry Bomb is just the outlier,btohqsg
Hes simply exploring the complexity of human love lol,btohqsg
Well  in oversimplified summary  IGOR sees the dynamic of the relationship while CMIYGL sees the perspective of an individual in such a relationship.,btohqsg
Well  listen to both albums to understand! (Or just read their lyrics),btohqsg
Were you the one who tryna cook salmon or wtv tht day,btohqsg
