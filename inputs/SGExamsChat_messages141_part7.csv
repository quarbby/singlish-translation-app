Last time whatever i memorized helped me expand my range of correct terms to use  in describing  but nvm maybe it is an outdated approach,btohqsg
Uh. I cant think of any. You just need to know the reactions  but I guess the format of the steps are quite standard,btohqsg
Must have gotten mixed up in the convo,btohqsg
Then u will automatically see the obvious ans in every question,btohqsg
Surveys and the like can be shared on discord,btohqsg
Anyth as long as it helps,btohqsg
QA just Google the a levels data booklet and remember all the stuff in the qa portion,btohqsg
any tips for remembering glycolysis process and Krebs cycle 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭,btohqsg
Hmm.. if there’s colour change.. purple solution add to colourless solution  purple colour will fade,btohqsg
Either see effervescence or brown ppt,btohqsg
Ah yes!Well it’s Kel hereis chem expert  take it from him!!,btohqsg
What if let's say ur reacting copper with hydrochloric acid. Copper is unreactive so,btohqsg
Potassium manganate with potassium iodide or H2O2,btohqsg
Oh yea i know common oxidising agent is potassium manganate while reducing agent is potassium iodide,btohqsg
Cool beans that extra buttons bot,btohqsg
Chemistry Practical NotesAll the Best for your Chemistry Practicalhttps://t.me/InorganicQA,btohqsg
You can upload it toexams.sgif you’d like,btohqsg
cuz i cannot remember the 'cycles' for my biochemistry exammmm 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 and the stupid amino acid structurws shHHehzuHHhsjsjshsuwhdisjs i want to Head --> Wall,btohqsg
There's YouTube video about amino acid structure also,btohqsg
ooo okay ty! is it on youtube or smth?,btohqsg
There are more   u see which one u need,btohqsg
Ok post here when you complete 1 set,btohqsg
Tell you what. For colour of ppt in cation tests:Draw a tree and 4 clouds.Write “Fe3+” on the tree trunk because it’s reddish-brownWrite “Fe2+” on the canopy of leaves because they are greenWrite “Al3+”  “Pb2+”  “Zn2+” and “Ca2+” in the 4 clouds because they are whiteWrite “Cu2+” on the sky because it’s blue😊,btohqsg
I'm memorising the effects on heating.( Colour)Copper oxide is blackLead oxide is blackZinc is white when cold yellow when hot,btohqsg
Still trying to get it all  and I still have heating of carbonates😢,btohqsg
Zinc oxide.. if you see solid turns yellow when hot  it’s zinc oxide in your syllabus,btohqsg
But I more or less memorised the cation anion and test for gas,btohqsg
All decompose except K2CO3 and Na2CO3,btohqsg
But for AgCO3  decomposition to Ag instead of Ag2O yeah,btohqsg
Acidify to remove any carbonates present  because most carbonates are insoluble in water and may lead to misleading results if present,btohqsg
Is that why add nitric acid first?,btohqsg
Add nitric acid because nitrates are soluble in water,btohqsg
So anion tests are just precipitation reactions,btohqsg
2 salt solutions give an insoluble salt and a by-product salt,btohqsg
So your by-product salt is nitrate.. which won’t form ppt to mislead the results,btohqsg
But still great stuff I'll wake up 4.30 tmmrw to mug that,btohqsg
Paiseh I probably trying memo in never touch phone,btohqsg
curious whats singapore's sentiment on transgendered people,btohqsg

And i havent studied anything too,btohqsg
then ur not rejected what ???,btohqsg
I don’t think that word means what you think it means,btohqsg
is poa paper 1 mostly about theory?,btohqsg
the ceiling is something ill nvr reach cos im short,btohqsg
throw u up to the ceiling u want?,btohqsg
Any advice to at least pass e math and a math,btohqsg
