To use the linked card overseas,btohqsg
And it converts transactions to online  hence the reason why cr mc linked to amaze will earn 4mpd on non excluded spend.,btohqsg
Hi all  new to credit cards. Which credit card is suggested for cashback and miles ya? Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi all  how to setup hsbc giro with Everyday account ?Checkout through HSBC apps   didn‚Äôt found any option üò¢,btohqsg
use physical interbank giro form from the billing organisation  or setup egiro from billing organisations that allow that,btohqsg
On converting transactions to online  do you have the online reference? I cant seem to find this,btohqsg
Wow ... annual fee so high !!!,btohqsg
it is trial and tested that all transactions via Amaze is online  lots of reviews on this,btohqsg
So does it mean its best if all the cr mc linked to amaze should reward for online txns?,btohqsg
yes  should get 10x points on Amaze+crmc so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
Hi  may I know for Standard Chartered Smart card  how does the 6% cashback work? Is it based off each transaction or the final billing statement? üòÖ,btohqsg
I don't have this card but just by reading the T&Cs  it looks like they add up your transactions,btohqsg
If you happen to need to recontract your open electricity market provider  will you recontract now or wait till Jan 2024 to make the decision? The lowest i see so far is 29.52¬¢/kWhvs Q4 2023 SP Tariff 31.00¬¢/kWh,btohqsg
I see cos I didn‚Äôt receive any cashback thus far so I was just wondering but thanks alot for your opinion üòä,btohqsg
Need to redeem the points for cash back  refer to videohttps://youtu.be/4P65pCuddXE?si=dSpsOGKPsQTLdRB0,btohqsg
You‚Äôll earn points  which can be converted to cash/voucher/miles. You won‚Äôt get cash rebates,btohqsg
hmm should remain around the same,btohqsg
Ohh thank you so much! üôè,btohqsg
Anyone gotten their cash deposit retain by ATM before? Unfortunately it's the weekends+tmr is PH,btohqsg
But can wait bah  gas market improving. Cuz oem contracts need to lock in contract. At most Jan go back tariff,btohqsg
Why does my due says 226.40 when I‚Äôve already paid my credit card bills?,btohqsg
This is very confusing. Unlike UOB One which clears the statement balance once you pay it,btohqsg
This is Standard chartered bank. I pay via bank transfer. I transfer money from UOB to SC and clicked pay credit card bills,btohqsg
That's how SC app works. You have to manually account for how much you've paid vs statement balance.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs so dumb. They should fire their UI/UX designer LOL,btohqsg
They've changed their UI at least 4 times in the past year. It's a joke how much they make things worse each update.,btohqsg
Exactly. Their designers are trash and their product team is worst for allowing this to happen,btohqsg
did you managed to try it?,btohqsg
Click on View Outstanding. Actually it should show outstanding on the home page,btohqsg
They should already have tons of ux ui designers ü§î,btohqsg
Btw when did you pay? It takes a few working days for SC to receive the money,btohqsg
Outstanding and due amount should be separated. If I paid off my due amount  there‚Äôs no reason for it to still show up,btohqsg
Last week. Already more than 4 days liao,btohqsg
This view is statement view. Just dun click it loh,btohqsg
U can check your transactions to see if they received the money. Sometimes it takes longer to reflect  but as long as you pay before due date should be ok,btohqsg
"tap on the ""view oustanding"". You can toggle to see outstanding and due amounts",btohqsg
I know. Outstanding and due amounts are separate things. Shouldn‚Äôt due amount be $0 the moment they confirmed your payment?,btohqsg
And yet they can‚Äôt do a good job. They‚Äôre clearly very bad at what they‚Äôre doing,btohqsg
It‚Äôll show unbilled (but posted) outstanding + outstanding balance from previous statement (if any),btohqsg
I tried mcc is 5812. using alipay,btohqsg
I can't. I need to cancel my wechat pay to re setup a new wechat pay. But because I have a 0.57 yuan in my wallet  I can't cancel account  and can't withdraw cos I don't have China cc card. Facepalm,btohqsg
Average daily balance will affect bonus interest?,btohqsg
hmmm weird. mine did not require any.,btohqsg
Hi all experts  my 100K for uob one account has been marked as Earnmarked for National Day promotion and I still can earn 420 interest for spending 500 ?,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  it show account balance no longer 100K in my one account and since this 100K can‚Äôt be withdraw,btohqsg
Hi   I saw u have similar question with me.. do you earn the interest ?,btohqsg
It's not exactly 420 every month it's based on the number of days in the month so it fluctuates. Nothing to be of concern about,btohqsg
Ok üëç how about giro to pay hsbc credit card with everyday AccI should expect stg easy to setup through apps,btohqsg
no easy way out  u need to submit paper interbank giro form to individual bank to process the giro from hsbc,btohqsg
For Standard Chartered Smart Credit Card  will it be eligible for 6% cashback if i use it to buy concession pass of $128 every month?Also will get 6% cashback for auto EZ-Link reload every month? Thanks,btohqsg
