This one 100% is scammer. Many scary ppl out there.,btohqsg
They usually not in the group chat by the time they PM  and are mainly targetingadmins.As long as you are an admin in any of similar groups as this  they probably have consolidated your id in a list.They just slowly PMing with different accounts. Got 2 accounts already PMed me  that's why I said IWILL NOTentertain PMs from anyone here unless it's about issues on typing in this chat. I will 100% delete our chat without replying if it's not relevant to above.,btohqsg
To further safeguard  I'm also perma banning accounts that attempts to join this group chat at least 3 times without completing verification. Very clear cut as these accounts try to rejoin the chat after 1 min of cooldown given by@shieldy_bot.,btohqsg
According to HSBC document on the website  TRB will be computed monthly and $50 monthly service fee will be charged if the preceding month’s TRB < $200K.HSBC does not take an average of TRB across several months.Whether or not they will actually impose the $50 monthly service fee from Jan 2025 is another matter. We’ll have to wait for DP.,btohqsg
