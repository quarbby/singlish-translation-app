What is the formula to calculate ocbc 360 average balance?I want to trf the funds to Mari save to earn interest but I also wanna make sure ocbc360 I deposit enough days and amount to ensure my average balance is high to qualify the interest too.,btohqsg
Calculate MAB using Excel#mabcalculator1. Open a spreadsheet with all the days in the month you're calculating.2. Login to your banking app and take the end of day balance from last month as the reference balance.3. By default  set all days of the month to be the same balance (do not key in manually but use = in the formula).4. Periodically login to your banking app and check your transactions based on the transaction date  do not change the balance manually but calculate with + and - in the formula.5. After the last day  use average formula to get estimated MAB.6. Top-up/withdraw if you need to adjust the MAB.,btohqsg
