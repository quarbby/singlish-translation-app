ya 99% of them are all run privately with intention to monetise,btohqsg
ok this is even funnier than this shit already was,btohqsg
That‚Äôs not the issue in contention here; recognise that we are only unhappy about him taking our members without any permission‚Äî something that many many many can attest to. The fake accounts thing is just icing on the cake.,btohqsg
the admins earn money from the ads they post,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôd be worth a lot,btohqsg

You can even add people from this group even when you are not added to the group,btohqsg
if you name the admins the right price you get to buy the group/channel,btohqsg

Privacy and security ‚Äî> groups and channels ‚Äî> only my contacts,btohqsg
And I occasionally see stuff on it,btohqsg

I think in the US the FTC will go hard on their ass,btohqsg

unique activities we can do togetherüòâüòâ,btohqsg

The legality part most related would be PDPA  personal data protection.,btohqsg
actually yea I wonder if it does violate PDPA,btohqsg
But you gotta be careful ah.,btohqsg
isnt pdpa just about private data,btohqsg
Cus if found in violation  can be fined quite a lot.,btohqsg

I can‚Äôt find combot in the O level groups and chat group,btohqsg
Well at least on their website,btohqsg
"If you consider telegram username and photo as personal data  then this group is ""in violation"".",btohqsg
I disabled combot from showing our groups on the website,btohqsg
But I'm pretty sure that won't hold up.,btohqsg
