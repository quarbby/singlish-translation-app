Im actually curious if maseratis especially the gran turismo   if they are problematic to own,btohqsg
It's a V6  it's a COE car  it makes a lot of noise but has no power  and it's an Italian car  can make an educated guess on the reliability,btohqsg
Find a workshop with a cozy waiting room,btohqsg
Will spend a good amount of time there,btohqsg
BMW also uses ZF  that's the only problem free part of the car,btohqsg
But all cars come with their problems  if prepared to pay for all the maintenance then of course go ahead,btohqsg
better cars to spend your money on,btohqsg
I geuss this is more reliable too haha,btohqsg
just dont get maseratis in general,btohqsg
They're not too bad for modern ones. Gran Turismos however have their fair share of issues. The biggest problem you'll face is labour costs and parts availability as it takes time to get parts and change them,btohqsg
They're no Audi/Mercedes/BMW in terms of reliability,btohqsg
fair share = alot  arnav is being nice,btohqsg
trust based on personal experience  it isnt very fun to have to send the car back to workshop often,btohqsg
An older swift or fit sure,btohqsg
MBM lol  but it comes with a big bill too,btohqsg
only time it is fast  is back to the workshop,btohqsg
Want a Maserati? Get an MC20,btohqsg
actually a not very popular alternative would be the F-Type,btohqsg
i believe the car has aged pretty well  some of them are 8-9 years old already but still look pretty good,btohqsg
no la go for V6 or V8,btohqsg
V6 is easily one of the best sounding of recent years,btohqsg
V6 is the most common one in Singapore too,btohqsg
Current gen we haven't got the V6 or V8,btohqsg
Only the 2.0 4 cyl sadly,btohqsg
If you have the dough might as well get a Porsche  at least parts are cheaper,btohqsg
Thank you to those who came down today for our very first SGCM Telegram Event! ‚ù§Ô∏èWe hope you enjoyed yourselves as much as we did planning for you! - E,btohqsg
And they don't break as often,btohqsg
And I'll be on the road thanks,btohqsg
