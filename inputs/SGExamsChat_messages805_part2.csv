Unless there’s something I’m not getting,btohqsg
Yeah but most investors won’t get that lucky lol,btohqsg
You could lose it all too,btohqsg
Might be better going mbs and putting it all on black,btohqsg
Oh so it’s kind of like shares created once in a while for employees,btohqsg
Not once in a while  my friend,btohqsg
If can afford to lose all then can just buy many companies that are high risk but huge growth potential,btohqsg
Then might as well just spy liao,btohqsg
Fact: most investors dont beat the index in the long run,btohqsg
Buy SPY and bury your head in the sand,btohqsg

You know we also have access to this wonderful invention called Google rite?,btohqsg
Thanks for increasing my rp by 3.75,btohqsg
@Chaeyeonsanasays there is google  so i went there and apparently its some sort of ns claim,btohqsg
But it's one of the claim,btohqsg

Wow the banana emoji is wild,btohqsg
My friend went Japan kenna mlm scam out of $20 on the railway platform,btohqsg
No because i went to hokkaido  not as touristy as kansai area and tokyo,btohqsg
What product did they get at least.,btohqsg
People fall for mlm because they are too nice to reject the salesperson,btohqsg
Not a product  it was a train ticket,btohqsg
I recently saw online post that some japanese restaurant mark up prices on foreign languages menu so it is btr to use google translate the japanese menu,btohqsg
Train ticket for the same train they just so happen to be taking  kenna conned into thinking that a random stranger was giving them a train ticket with more perks,btohqsg
? And the train tix is fake?,btohqsg
If train tix is fake  its just a scam  not a mlm,btohqsg
But it is after my trip then i cane across that post on ig,btohqsg
to block view of Mt fuji,btohqsg
And we alr went japan thrice,btohqsg
It was real but it did not give them the perks they were conned to believe,btohqsg
Most of them are really nice,btohqsg
But there are some who rabidly hate chinese and korean people,btohqsg
"I've seen such signs as ""no chinese and koreans allowed"" outside places",btohqsg
I think singaporeans generally they ok lah,btohqsg
"They said that the person showed them what seem to be a identical ticket to them but there were differences and the mlm person told them these ""differences"" meant their ticket was $50 more expensive",btohqsg
I think it's fine if you can speak english,btohqsg
What did they even sell the perks on,btohqsg
