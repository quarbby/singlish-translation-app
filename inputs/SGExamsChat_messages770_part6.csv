I think the issue is more of u not recognizing ur opportunities,btohqsg
Like for me at least as a dancer  I got to perform at many shows which I never expected to perform at considering I'm q new,btohqsg
And its all shit that I go for,btohqsg
ryan is back at it again,btohqsg
Ur the one who's choosing to not take the opportunities that's given to you,btohqsg
Don't drag the rest of society down with ur inability to be a human,btohqsg
Don't people always say set your goals and work towards it? When was it ever work and create a goal for yourself,btohqsg
you are the limiting reagent of society,btohqsg
And then create a goal for urself,btohqsg
Wished I had my laptop with me,btohqsg
The two other people with me rn,btohqsg
My understudy disappeared to the canteen,btohqsg
Ystd he disappeared from 8am to 11am,btohqsg
They're identifying similarities in Christianity and hinduism,btohqsg
Recognizing opportunities  means recognizing a goal you would have otherwise missed  isn't that the case.,btohqsg
I'm know I'm not saying bs cause it's literally factual  if that is not what is being said then I just could not get my point across clear enough,btohqsg
"an opportunity is not a ""goal you would have otherwise missed""",btohqsg
Should threaten to report him and say he’ll get charged if he continues,btohqsg
Then what is it? In the context,btohqsg
In SAF is the understudy thing called ADO,btohqsg
please search google or your dictionary,btohqsg
Tbh I also don’t know what ADO stands for,btohqsg
i can have a goal without having the opportunity to advance myself towards that goal  but i can have an opportunity without having a goal,btohqsg
I just know that when they give off in lieu for it they say it’s “ADO understudy OIL”,btohqsg
Idk I just know that for an extra duty with shift 12h they give 1 day off in lieu,btohqsg
But my office hour is 9h45min so I rather not have to do understudy lol,btohqsg
For this it’s either ppl stay overnight or come on a weekend,btohqsg
Not yet it’s in July for me,btohqsg
That’s why need to make use of the lack of Mc restriction,btohqsg
If it’s SOP to give OIL I think it’s grounds for reporting him,btohqsg
What makes you think I do not give a fuck about my life...,btohqsg
I guess it’s another reason why scdf>saf in general,btohqsg
shldnt even be an argument ngl,btohqsg
You literally see what I said about my gpa...it literally went from exact 1.69 to exact 2.57 in one sem,btohqsg
Cos I’m the branch that deals with NSmen/nsf admin matters  if they’re going to receive goodie bags with snacks they all get delivered to our branch. Often there’s extras and we get to take them for free.,btohqsg
"It shows I'm doing shit about my life and not just ""not giving a fuck""",btohqsg
Like in my office got free milo can milo powder nature valley bar and nuts,btohqsg
They call it personnel branch in scdf,btohqsg
But isn't ur point people are actively choosing to ignore these opportunities,btohqsg
They just leave all the surplus items in some area of the office,btohqsg
Oh maybe hrd is for CDA?,btohqsg
eh we all refer to the maj joshua department as HRD,btohqsg
My branch has roles such as charging ppl  recording their leave  booking ppl for ippt,btohqsg
he's the guy that deals with NSFs back then,btohqsg
i mean that was my entire job for FFRB,btohqsg
because they're inefficient pieces of shit,btohqsg
I have no idea who that is,btohqsg
imagine as the admin who needs to split all the trainees into the 5 rotas,btohqsg
and i don't even get the trainee list,btohqsg
until the actual day of posting,btohqsg
