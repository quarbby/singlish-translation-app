I happen to see one hwz thread got one person say those decarbon service will mess up ecu so wanted to check first,btohqsg
Rather pay more for walnut blast if it’s safer,btohqsg
The day you believe the nonsense in HWZ is the day Pete becomes clever,btohqsg
Unless your workshop anyhow put back your engine cover,btohqsg

But this model no rear cam,btohqsg
Ohh i was thinking just buy 2 then fit one for front one for rear,btohqsg
Or just mount old dashcam to the back,btohqsg
Nowadays alot sneaky ppl scratch the side,btohqsg

Yeah  guess it's time to spend my 2m on a RR now 🤣,btohqsg
Hi  can those work for the government can take high loan / full loan from dealer? I have been told by the dealer is ok  but like cannot when i read the detail online.,btohqsg
But car loan is secured ah so…,btohqsg
But lets not forget Sg is capped at 30% dp  70% loan max for purchases of cars,btohqsg
He's asking about full loan/high loan,btohqsg
Yes ik. Reminding him of the current regulations cus he's a civil servant. Like what Imran mentioned  FE.,btohqsg
End of the day  full/high loan is illegal so that’s why when you look it up  cannot,btohqsg
I heard full loan interest rates quite high... 4% or so?,btohqsg
You shouldn’t even full loan in the first place,btohqsg
Minimum 4+ now. But most people getting full loans don't have a strong profile so they're getting quotes 5 to 6% usually,btohqsg
Oh  so those with stronger profile gets lower?,btohqsg
Pay full amount   do not take loan   better,btohqsg
Anytime want to sell also can,btohqsg
Or just downpayment a comfortable amount w a monthly instalment u can afford to pay per month,btohqsg
Mine I just buy with full cash,btohqsg
Full cash also not the best idea,btohqsg
The SA ask me take mind 10k loan,btohqsg
Depends on how much your car is,btohqsg
If it's a significant amount  full cash not worth as you're hurting your liquidity and cash flow,btohqsg
Your money will be so much better somewhere else,btohqsg
In an ideal situation  most will just pay full amount for anything  don't you think? 😊,btohqsg
Not always  more times than not for big purchases if you can finance it's better because you can easily make the interest back,btohqsg
It really depends. Big ticket item u shud always keep spare cash in the event shit goes down. Eg something happened in the family or ur hse suddenly everything spoil need repair,btohqsg
What we r referring to is excessive debt,btohqsg
A lil bit of debt is okay,btohqsg
Ya . Maybe you are right,btohqsg
I prefer not to pay more for interest,btohqsg
AD don’t like buyers to pay full cash 😅,btohqsg
That where their additional commission comes from,btohqsg
Just pay extra 1 or 2k lo,btohqsg
But thank you Aetos for the professional response!,btohqsg
