Cos organic is a bunch of memorisations,btohqsg
Organic is memory  but itâ€™s very elegant stuff,btohqsg
Itâ€™s all based on electron transfer,btohqsg
Maybe some of the reagent need memroise  but if u understand the mechanism actually no need memroise anythubg,btohqsg
Yes I meant the reagents and conditions,btohqsg
