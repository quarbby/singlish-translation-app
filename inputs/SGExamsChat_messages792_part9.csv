im really tired to think about it,btohqsg
my parents only know how to be like do this do that  yea saying / telling me what to do is such a simple task,btohqsg
but they dun even bother abt my struggles and all,btohqsg
when something cooks up w my siblings  they will care much more,btohqsg
sis just could not get the job,btohqsg
the only time i met success is in TM,btohqsg
What does that make me lmao,btohqsg

im just lost what to do,btohqsg
Put it simply  they grew up in a generation where parenting and society is very diff from the parenting and society we live in today.So your views will differ alot from them in many ways. The same way our grandparents view of the world differed from our parents. There is nothing inherently wrong  you just have to work to their weaknesses,btohqsg
Cmon u achieve more than I did lmao,btohqsg
The struggles you face today is as well very different from the struggles your parents had. They understand you are struggling but will never fully understand the reasons behind it.That's why there is a disconnect,btohqsg
actually this make sense  i know last time my mum was definitely more independent and everything she settled herself coz her parents were somewhat uneducated and poor,btohqsg
and she worked her way up in poverty (that is a skill coz from poverty to earning a psc scholarship is something idk how but ya),btohqsg
Unfortunately all I learnt in life is no one cares. Pessimistic as it is. No one cares.. not even the person getting paid to care. Cares.,btohqsg
This could be a subtle reason because you see the accomplishments of your mumAnd you feel like you have not done as much as her so you feel like you are lacking,btohqsg
Don't feel inferior because you did not do as much  her life when she was your age is very diff from yours.,btohqsg
very true  your own struggles  you ownself find your way out of it,btohqsg
the annoying thing is my dad can tell me whatever without caring about my mood,btohqsg
