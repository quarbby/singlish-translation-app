Yeah i don’t understand their stacking means,btohqsg
For me over the weekend fri i stack 6 615 630 sat i stack 7 715..wait for sms ..i weekend warrior,btohqsg
Pick up 2 orders at 5.30 from same store  deliver the 2nd order on 6.30. Why late for 20 mins? Thought the delivery time is 1 hr.,btohqsg
Did u click the delivered button 20min later,btohqsg
some oddle food delivery is collection 530pm. then delivery timing is 545 to 615pm only. Especially food at sultan area (Malay food),btohqsg
same I also stack 5 515 530,btohqsg
Or it could be click the arrive n loading complete late by 20mins,btohqsg
No  I completed the 2nd order at 6.30 sharp,btohqsg
Pick up time is 5.30 for both orders at the same restaurant.,btohqsg
Don't understand why llm need to be hard on its driver. Without llm driver. They can tahan meh,btohqsg
Note stated deliver between 6 to 7pm,btohqsg
Pickup 530  1.5 hrs to deliver?,btohqsg
Yes  the first order delivered before 6 and customer ask why so early. Told them I deliver only,btohqsg
If base on LLM SOP 55mins..Some oddle orders is 45-55mins..Most of the time is 1 hour..dont think all oddles order time are the same,btohqsg
Oddles got 2 timing so far for me,btohqsg
Once llm start to implement penalty  we can close our accounts,btohqsg
If they want us take jobs more than 30min apart. Meaning 45 min. They can set in their software to refrain us from taking. Sure a lot will accidenttaly bid within 30min.,btohqsg
Cause they wan suspend u then eat ur $75 ma,btohqsg
Well old app can do that. New app they allow stacking. Now suddenly give us warning  dunno wtf they want,btohqsg
Maybe they wan get rid some ppl... Since they got a lot monk little porridge.,btohqsg
Invite the ceo into the chat lol,btohqsg
Rider n driver job not easy,btohqsg
Customer take motor but item not motor item,btohqsg
keep seeing like 7-10 stops for $30-$40,btohqsg
Lai see how walker completed the job 55min,btohqsg
U have to spend at least 15 min for pick up n drop off,btohqsg
Plus the journey maybe around 15mins,btohqsg
So 1 job around 30 mins,btohqsg
If kenot stack  really hard liao,btohqsg
Do gf lor. No need stack aso Cho buay wan🤣,btohqsg
For those full time llm jialat  but so far van orders still ok,btohqsg
Van aso no need stack . They one job ba ba Liao,btohqsg
guys dont mind me asking  how much on average you all earn a day doing lalamove?,btohqsg
Hard to search :( so I thought to ask,btohqsg
just wrote to LLM to clarify their policy on stacking,btohqsg
but i agree that if their policy don't allow stacking.. then it shouldn't be even allowed on their app..,btohqsg
Sometimes bid job how to see so details,btohqsg
Cannot see location properly aready might be gone. How to see timing until so Zhun. .. think they really want suspend some drivers... If not all die together sharing this small pie.,btohqsg
actually i think the app can stack is because they are allowing themselve a lifeline when orders are at its peak and not enough drivers..,btohqsg
When demand more than supply  they need more drivers,btohqsg
When supply more then demand  they have to micromanage,btohqsg
so now more drivers than orders.. so they are nip picking on this..,btohqsg
but then again  which means to say they suka suka do things as they wish.. there is no standard policy,btohqsg
heng i do weekends n off days only.,btohqsg
so i gona test system again this weekend..,btohqsg
But now u need double the time to earn the same amount,btohqsg
yea so i will continue to stack on weekends,btohqsg
Llm really don't have a proper protocol. Suka suka change rules here and there till everyone tao gong gong.,btohqsg
i won't care.. until they send me sms or email.. then i will roast them 9696,btohqsg
Yes me too cos already took advance and not going to cancel. Just do it and if they want suspend also bobian. Take it as take a break,btohqsg
I'm also gg write in about this stack orders issue,btohqsg
they wont suspend u . due to no more driver or rider,btohqsg
When we need their assistance  all live chat no one pick up. When we trying make a living and helping them make profit too  and they want come kajiao. Nbz,btohqsg
I only joined 2 months. Aready so many pattern. I wonder how they going to get listed in ny with their prata policy🤣🤣😂,btohqsg
so what have u learnt these 2 months?,btohqsg
"Dun put all your bets on 1 horse aka ""LLM"". 🤣. Part time play play ok",btohqsg
Do stack order but not late also kana msg.. guess very hard to work with LLM now,btohqsg
Colllect and send nearby also cannot do.. How to earn now..,btohqsg
Same timing same shop on route no wrong IMO..,btohqsg
Ya lor.. same timing n collection also nearby,btohqsg
Not sure also where i collect.. sian to check,btohqsg
Too many drivers currently?doubt so..PHV gone back to do PHV.,btohqsg
But demand lesser..drivers pool same without higher increase after phase2ha,btohqsg
In fact already do less order from LLM and concentrating more from other delivery company.. also kana msg.. sian ah,btohqsg
How u know they gone bk... Some might fell in lurve with food delivery,btohqsg
B4 dis kana late warning.. now stack warning.. after dis penalise for taking less order.. 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Some might do food delivery fully to avoid risk of fetching strangers,btohqsg
Food delivery Higher risk. Contact with strangers at restaurant.,btohqsg
Any bros here try try stacking again see will tiok suspend bo,btohqsg
My best day so far.. I heard ppl here can hit $300 n above.,btohqsg
The getting in and out of my vehicle is so leychey when doing lalamove 😩😩😩,btohqsg
Yeah.. n exceed grace period is heartache .. I kena $5 parking charge at Orchard central when I thought it's still 30 min grace,btohqsg
That’s like almost half the earning sometimes,btohqsg
Yeah. So cbd job have to stack.. else how to earn,btohqsg
I stacked once. Really once and then the vendor was late so I was late and kena lalamove penalty,btohqsg
I c. They dun care abt their drivers one.,btohqsg
For me when I stack  I wld make an effort to call the restaurant and ask if I can collect 15 mins earlier  some ok  some not ok,btohqsg
this is a good idea! I'll try it next time. Thanks for the tip!,btohqsg
No prob. Not every restaurant is ok  but just try. That's how I can have 3 stack orders still deliver on time. But despite so  LLM still msg me not to stack.,btohqsg
I think they'll only deduct the $75 in full for fraudulent cases.. if they kick u out due to performance they'll refund u back less any penalties,btohqsg
Stack 2 orders then late cause of the merchant?,btohqsg
$300 n above will become a thing of the past if really can only take jobs at least 30mins apart,btohqsg
I think late cos of the first merchant which delayed the second order,btohqsg
yep but the merchant i late was like 1 hour late — genki sushi at westgate,btohqsg
then both customer complain like siao,btohqsg
If I got stack order  the merchant late  I will inform the merchant I will only give u 10 mins  if the food still not ready  k will msg cs to cancel,btohqsg
they compensated me $12 for the 1 hr I wait,btohqsg
Unless u have no other orders,btohqsg
then will kena? for asking them to cancel,btohqsg
I stack 2 orders   1st order on time  12pm three bun  1215pm bao makers  late for 30 mins  means 1245pm the food still not ready  then I call 1st order customer  lucky customer ok to let me deliver before 130pm  then I wait till 115pm  rush like hell,btohqsg
After tat delay  I only stack max 2 order for one trip  heart attack,btohqsg
can be so dangerous for us to rush also leh,btohqsg
Oh btw on Sunday I was at Suntec. I collected order already however was stuck in the carpark queue for 20 mins cos driver left car to top up cash card 😤,btohqsg
For next case  I just ask cs to cancel as I say I got on hand order to deliver within 45 mins and the restaurant kenot promise the food can be ready in 30 mins,btohqsg
contacting cs can be such a pain in the ass too! I've waited 30+ minutes for live chat before which is ridiculous la 30 mins can only wait,btohqsg
Just submit the photo n reason lor,btohqsg
So far never kana penalty yer,btohqsg
Although customer is ok  n we r not in the wrong  but just a word of caution  the platforms will still fault us for being late,btohqsg
Ya  if I know I wan to contact Cs  I will print screen for all the related order first,btohqsg
And I got 2 phone ma  will use another phone to login llm acc to chat with cs  then another phone using the print screen info to deliver,btohqsg
Just sharing my tips with u all 😂,btohqsg
Can still do live chat n screen shot n gps,btohqsg
Wah sometimes have to wait for 30-45 mins. When reach destination how to swipe end job?,btohqsg
🙏Hard the Cs respond b4 that 😂😂,btohqsg
The live chat app really sucks,btohqsg
Cs live chat depend on lucks also,btohqsg
So far I always live chat with cs urgently,btohqsg
Maybe wait like 10 mins m,btohqsg
I do ft  I think I gg to cui liao,btohqsg
Tdy I still don't have oddle orders appear 😂,btohqsg
But when I claim waiting time  I will only live chat cs when I relax at home one,btohqsg
U may be blocked by Oddle,btohqsg
I can see nxt day n day after etc,btohqsg
But when comes the current day  immediate orders don't appear  and current day advance jobs also don't appear,btohqsg
Actually i livechat only when free. Anything can be chat at end of day😜,btohqsg
Maybe I jibai? I tell merchant we not gf or panda  can wait u for 1 hours for food,btohqsg
But if my last order or bo stack i just wait them nicely outside n smoke lo,btohqsg
Use that  I dunno what it's called,btohqsg
Leave the live chat there  but prepare the screen shot of ur job order n GPS b4 hand,btohqsg
Then switch ard using that option  if u use 1 hp,btohqsg
Ya  so far I claim late fee for every orders more than 15 mins,btohqsg
I dunno what that button I circled in red is called 😂,btohqsg
Yup  u have to know drop off address n pic n contact,btohqsg
So if u need live chat cs   just print screen all orders on hand,btohqsg
Cs will ask u 3 qs,btohqsg
Blocked for current day jobs n immediate jobs but not nxt day advance jobs? Weird,btohqsg
1st Order number  ya  maybe u will feel dulan n ccb  I wait for u livechat maybe 15 mins  then u ask me which order ? Knn u cs kenot check meh? Yes   they can't check  so remember print screen the order number 😂😂,btohqsg
I ever encountered. I gave Cs all the info  then tell Cs to process the new order with the late fee  then I left the chat,btohqsg
Nxt thing they actually did that😂,btohqsg
They can CHK la. Just give them yr name n phone number all record will be out,btohqsg
The cs not even replied my msg,btohqsg
I want to claim late fee,btohqsg
They chut pattern say cannot CHK cos want you go out n they say bye bye,btohqsg
1st order number2nd pick up timing3rd food pick up timing,btohqsg
They will check wat time u upload the photos in app bro,btohqsg
Depends on whether u meet good Cs or not,btohqsg
But so far I kana one order golden pillow kenot claim nia,btohqsg
I bid the order then call to confirm,btohqsg
She pick up my call then I inform her I will reach within 15 mins,btohqsg
She say ok arh  kenot late more than 15 mins,btohqsg
Reach liao  then I found out she ady cancel order n rebook with others,btohqsg
Llm cs called me say I can't claim due to the user ady cancel the order after she hang up my call,btohqsg
Llm app bo notification pop up for order cancelation,btohqsg
I constantly check the order 😂,btohqsg
I ady inform u I will reach within 15 mins  if u can't wait just tell me ma  Chao jibai,btohqsg
I will check also   but tat day bo check just see gps to go kaki bukit,btohqsg
Ok one of the perks on the job is that sometimes I get to see pretty chefs.. like the home based chef at Jelebu road  I pick up her orders quite often,btohqsg
Cause so far of I far for the pick up  I will call n inform Merchant also,btohqsg
If can't wait then just cancel lo,btohqsg
Orders r thrown out by food platforms to multiple delivery platforms,btohqsg
Llm policy is we have to reach within 30 mins for pick up now orders ma,btohqsg
Ask her favourite u this driver lo,btohqsg
Sometimes in times of alot of orders  whoever can go down n get first will get first. Then restaurants won't cancel the other drivers orders until we reach n find out ourselves,btohqsg
Haha I even bought my dinner from her. Her dry laksa quite nice,btohqsg
The few times I kena double book is all like this,btohqsg
She's definitely in her mid 20s,btohqsg
Then girl next door liao  if u single can try liao lo,btohqsg

11.30am first order. 10pm last order.. so that's almost 12 hours,btohqsg
Wow thats a lot of hardwork bro. Reminder dont be late 4 pick.up n delivery and also be wary of stack orders. LLM will see all that and not because the amount of effort n delivery we make. If not yr account will be suspended,btohqsg
Yep. Maybe c when LLM got strong competitor then can stack across platforms lol,btohqsg
Thats what i do now.. stack orders between 2 platform.. sometimes stack 2 4 orders at 1 time..😂😂But see the pick up time..location and also delivery location. All must be on the way one. If not u gonna be late for all delivery n pick up..👍👍,btohqsg
That's wad I did also. But on Sunday I kena delay at carpark for 20 mins then I gg.. super rush after that lol,btohqsg

Sorry 4got to inform. I use bike for delivery. So there is FOOD PANDA..GRAB FOOD..DELIVERY..,btohqsg
Sorry bro car one i not sure. But if u have PHV licence can try GRAB FOOD.. in my opinion not worth solely to do LLM cause their order is quite far and the amount is not worth it. For time and petrol consumption is a waste for me. Thats y i do 2 platform.. if LLM order sucks.. i do the other platform.. WIN-WIN situation 4 me..😂😂😂,btohqsg
