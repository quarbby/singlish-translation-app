Zero because Oct MAB is lower the Sep MAB.,btohqsg
Just calculated  you're right!12 Mar - opened UOB Stash account28 Mar - 50k deposited30 Mar - 50k depositedMar MAB - 15k (bonus interest of 1.95% p.a. for the 5k above first 10k for 20 days)Base interest - $0.41 (15k √ó 0.05% √ó 365 √∑ 20)Bonus interest - $5.34 (5k √ó 1.95% √ó 365 √∑ 20)#dpfor UOB Stash account opening,btohqsg

I say if i recall correctly lol so maybe i am wrong. That is not my statement  is my player 2,btohqsg
Anyway  i know mab only start from day u open for uob stash,btohqsg
oh ok..so TLDR... stash ADB is based on number of days the account is opened for in the opening month?,btohqsg
Yes like ladys for bonus uni dollar,btohqsg
Some people just din count the fact that bonus interest credit next month and make statement loh.,btohqsg
And also he has the account in Sep with higher MAB than Oct  which totally negates all his DP already.,btohqsg
This happen when people dont know how stash work. Must maintain mab or increase. That why if put for earmark must totally dont touch stash de or withdraw only bonus interest the day it is credited.Base interest can never be withdraw during earmark as it count toward the month mab which make it higher by default,btohqsg
