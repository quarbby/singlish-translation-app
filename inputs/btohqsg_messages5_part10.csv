Anw it's a good tool for calculating downpayment + stamp duty amount,btohqsg
For Singaporeans just select the PR option instead to calculate the 5% amount,btohqsg
but my wife and I paid about $27200 don't know where the gap came from,btohqsg
I check my appt letter  still have conveyancing fee of $395,btohqsg
Why all your BSD so high one,btohqsg
4r in mature estate mah  mine 3r,btohqsg
If you full pay the bto  will there still be any interest added to it ?,btohqsg
Means upon collection of keys if Iâ€™ve decided to full pay the balance 90 percent . Will there be an interest added to this 90 percent,btohqsg
If you pay with cpf  when you sell your flat you'll have to return the money to your cpf with accrued interest,btohqsg
If you alr pay in full there's nothing to charge interest on,btohqsg
Okayyy so better to full pay in cash than cpf right,btohqsg
Depends on whether you can earn more than 2.5% with your cash,btohqsg
Cose I feel paying mthly = technically u are paying more for the house .,btohqsg
unless he down-payment in cash too  otherwise AI still applies,btohqsg
Was wondering if pay by cash have interest added to it . But Thks ! Got a clearer view now,btohqsg
1. use cash for home loan while accumulating OA+minimise AI of 2.5%-can't save up2. use OA for home loan while topping up SA+accumulating 1.5% of interest-can't save up3. use OA for home loan+save up-accumulating 2.5% of AIunless can use cash to generate >2.5% of interest  accumulate CPFOA,btohqsg
Down pay 10 percent and planning to full pay the 90 only when collection of keys ( but was abit confuse to the interest part ),btohqsg
many people thought this way too,btohqsg
See if can get the house first lol ahahhahaha . So many ppl applied for the Bukit Merah house,btohqsg
no interest as long as your CPFOA is not involved  but you paid cash for the 5% down-payment too?,btohqsg
should be the most in BTO history,btohqsg
Iâ€™m still waiting if I can even get a ballot,btohqsg
plan your finance well especially in this crisis,btohqsg
But if I donâ€™t get then I think I might try for an ec - the waiting time isnâ€™t so long compared to the bto houses ( I think ),btohqsg
Just asking ard for advise :),btohqsg
Good luck to everyone who is balloting hhaha,btohqsg
1. use cash for housing while accumulating OA+accumulate annual int of 2.5%-much much poorer,btohqsg
Save money . Pay lesser I guess ?  2.5 percent interest is a lot . Can use that for other investmentBut since no interest is added if u full cash then thatâ€™s good I guess . Doesnâ€™t work the same for cars. I had to pay a slight interest when I full cash the car .,btohqsg
people applying for TB are high earners for sure,btohqsg
It would be a wise choice if u wanna sell it in future I guess,btohqsg
But cpf interest rate high . Hahaha Iâ€™m losing out on that,btohqsg
profit margin should be lower than duxton,btohqsg
I find TB nicer in design,btohqsg
Itâ€™s facing the sea right ?,btohqsg
only for units above 32nd floor,btohqsg
70 units onlyahhaha and the number of applications,btohqsg
because the condo is 31 storey high,btohqsg
normally people who are paying cash in full are elders and couples who are shifting to their 2nd subsidised HDB flat,btohqsg
Can you guys tell me bto woodgrove ascent have balcony or not?,btohqsg
oh then you may consider trying for dakota breeze under SBF,btohqsg
though it deprives you from applying BTO this launch,btohqsg
Why don't try 3room for much higher chance haha,btohqsg
Iâ€™m 23 . Not so old yet . ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Itâ€™s even smaller . The 4 room is already not that huge,btohqsg
And I think we can only apply for 1 right ? Not more than that,btohqsg
23yo thinking to pay the house in full upon getting keys ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
Ya I mean apply 3 room instead of 4,btohqsg
yes just one project and one flat type,btohqsg
The house will take 5 years man . 64 mths . Crazy waiting timing . Due to covid I guess,btohqsg
for SBF  many projects and one flat type,btohqsg
