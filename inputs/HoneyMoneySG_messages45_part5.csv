Hi - I had applied for a HSBC credit card. but very suprisinglthey rejected my application.   When i called up the bank they said they cannot tell me the reason for rejection  and I can wait for 6 months and I apply again? Anyone faced this kinf of issue before.?,btohqsg
I have good salary and multiple credit cards for many years. . very surprised.,btohqsg
Luckily I havenâ€™t buy eVoucher via CapitaStar app yet. So the only way is to buy from Wogi to clock $500 min spend?,btohqsg
Most of time they won't tell u reason even u got good credit report or u are able to meet their salary,btohqsg
yeah. I tried a couple of times  but they are not telling me the reason.  I maintain a high balance in the EGA account with them.... still.....,btohqsg
Better don't kept on try if unsuccessful,btohqsg
So apply ega first then sms?,btohqsg
hmm.. i was going to say certain nationalities  HSBC is cautious and won't do business with them due to tax implications.if you are singaporean  then hard to explain... have you cancelled cards with HSBC before? I know some banks will not approve you cards if you are deemed to be frequent cancel and apply.,btohqsg
The only 'discrimination' i faced was during 2008 when Maybank refused to approve credit cards for anyone working in US financial institutions for fear of job instability.,btohqsg
if you use the app  its common to get this rejection because they dont allow second application. Wait for them to call you back.,btohqsg
I never tried myself but think so,btohqsg
https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/available-options.htmlThere might be 'something' they noted from your credit report that give them reasons. FIs typically do not give reasons whatsoever as doing so would reveal their private business rules.Personally  I would just move on. I take it as the FI's loss.,btohqsg
Thanks for all the comments. Appreciate it.,btohqsg

Does not using my credit cards hurt my credit score?,btohqsg
No.But cancelling credit cards may hurt your credit score from what I understand.However  you also need to be aware (if income under $120k) that banks may add up all your approved credit limits across all banks when assessing you for a new credit card.,btohqsg
It will not hurt but it certainly will not improve.. credit card gives you credit history which is something institutions use to assess when deciding to give you a loan,btohqsg
Hi all. Difference between AMEX SQ Highflyer vs KrisFlyer Ascend?,btohqsg

Hi experts  anyone owning citi prestige card and able to get your annual fee waived?,btohqsg
Citibank states it clearly as non waivable.,btohqsg
If u fulfill the eligibility and want a Visa Infinite that the >500 $ annual fees can be waived   please take a look at CIMB Bank. This is the only one that does not need u to waive annual fees because there is no annual fees to begin with.,btohqsg
I have about 90 posb daily $.Is there an optimal way to claim the daily$ ?,btohqsg
Also  would like to ask how does one maximise the benefits of the UOB lady's? Considering to get my significant other to sign up for it.,btohqsg

have you ever paid your credit card bill before the bill is generated?,btohqsg
Yes :) for exceptional reasons such as cancellation of a credit card.If your concern is the risks of late payment fees  u can make use of the  the 3 biggest bank ibanking portal to schedule payment to your cards. By doing so  u can settle all payments of your cards at one go.,btohqsg
ah.. is your employer crypto related?,btohqsg
Hi  can i check for HSBC EGA promotion  my reference month is March with $0.In May  i deposited 100K. Do i need to deposit additional funds in June and July or just leave the 100K (from May) in the acc for June and July?,btohqsg
It will be sufficient for u to get the promo interest based on 100k. If u deposit more  will get more,btohqsg
Thanks. So I do get interest every month until the EGA promo ends   if I keep the 100K intact,btohqsg
oh actually I'm posting the question to@Siriusblack_82because he said his card application failed. Sometimes paying in advance is not considered a good thing.,btohqsg
you can withdraw partial too it's not locked in. but will get lesser interest.,btohqsg
Anyone tried using cardup or ipaymy for car loan instalment? If so  does it counts as online payment?,btohqsg
No  I mean scheduling payment. I never ever pay my credit cards bill by giro.,btohqsg
for scheduling payment do we need to specify the amount ?or it will be pay according to the bill directly ?,btohqsg
this is troublesome right. you need to determine the amount.,btohqsg

If successful should be instant. Applied for 3 UOB cards last week and could add cards to Google pay within a day,btohqsg
were you able to add UOB cards to google pay before you received the physical cards?,btohqsg
Yes  but not immediately. Cards showed up on web browser iBanking but on app.Tried next day and showed it up on app. Added to Google pay and successfully used all 3.Maybe only takes a few hrs but I didn't check any more on the first day,btohqsg
U need to specify the amount. You can  remove the fees or dispute transactions in this way. For giro  u can't.,btohqsg
