Other guys and girls also want the A,btohqsg
What hes teaching is irrelevant to his name or profession,btohqsg
At least wrt to whats on the whiteboard,btohqsg
My eyes are on the white board,btohqsg
Go to class like normal  this ain't Riverdale,btohqsg
Spf taught me to be vigilant and observant,btohqsg

Yes  close schools so that the kids can go hang out and play outside,btohqsg
High discipline environments like school and military camps are probably some of the best places to be in such situations,btohqsg
today my usual timetable ended 6,btohqsg
i took another route to avoid crowds tho,btohqsg
this do be scary squeezing with everyone,btohqsg
Closing public transport will be more effective in this case,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt have it then it‚Äôs half a lockdown already,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs right or not to keep it going either,btohqsg
Most schools don‚Äôt have facilities to let you stay in,btohqsg
NS will always be the last thing to go,btohqsg
Corona is a virus  that I just want to minus,btohqsg
tuition centres wont pay u market rate,btohqsg
i remember some tuition centre tried to pay me $8/h under the pretext of 'internship',btohqsg
A little more corrupt with every cent you receive from giving tuition,btohqsg
But still the boss gets like 90 percent,btohqsg
maths is the easiest subject to teach,btohqsg
time to delete/censor some of the above nonsense,btohqsg
And sometimes I'll need to relieve class,btohqsg

even one of the interns i met at sch admitted IB was an easier way out as compared to A lvls,btohqsg
no la  u look at IB vs a lvl syllabus,btohqsg
A lvl syllabus is legit 1x good hantam the content one,btohqsg
IB is more laxed  in fact it trains one how to write better than learn content,btohqsg
Bushidao i dont have basis of comparison i cant say whicch one harder,btohqsg
We should have IB instead of gay levels,btohqsg
