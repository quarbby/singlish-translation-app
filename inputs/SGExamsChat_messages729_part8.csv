I wanted to take it but I couldn't find resources,btohqsg
Also I am more of a narrative guy,btohqsg
Plus you can talk about who is right or wrong,btohqsg
Ell is very technical  I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the right subject for everyone,btohqsg
Huh? U really wanna pick a stance?,btohqsg
Like lit would be more appealing than ell for most,btohqsg
Even in history I never did pick a stance which was why I always got shit grades in school,btohqsg
Yea  like pick a stance without numbers and stats,btohqsg
Cuz my teachers always wanted you to just follow the narrative they teach,btohqsg
You choose who should bella pick,btohqsg
But tbh idk twilight story so ...,btohqsg
Ngl I think that's the wrong way to do humanities but then again I only got my first intro into lit when I did an English seminar.,btohqsg
I mean of course you have to look at both sides uh,btohqsg
And then make a fair judgement,btohqsg
Hmm when I written my essays I never did make any judgements or even attempted it.,btohqsg
U can and most do that for SEAB exams,btohqsg
But if u do end up doing it for uni don't do that for humanities as it would be anachronistic at best and just hypocritical at worse.,btohqsg
as in because i had a friend in MI who would study day and night for h1 geog  only to come out with D for A levels,btohqsg
idk how he studied la but,btohqsg
i always had the impression after that  that h1 geog is torture,btohqsg
Apparently for econs is like having a formula,btohqsg
like actually study studied  not like oh i studied but nothing go in (me),btohqsg
And correct structure to get the marks,btohqsg
I did that too lmao first time I did Alevels I self study for 6 months no experience,btohqsg
Come out C for H2 History,btohqsg
I finished an entire tys during the june holidays,btohqsg
Like Es and Ds  but idk honestly that says more about my sch?,btohqsg
my school nobody passes h1 geog for some reason,btohqsg
Nobody in my sch can complete h2 chem or phy prac,btohqsg
Man did not write finish the planning section,btohqsg
Wait so you just retake a levels uh,btohqsg
Kidding haha  not blank  but I didn't know how to get the marks,btohqsg
My physics planning was also blank (but not the reason u think of),btohqsg
Somehow i got a b for h2 chem and h2 phy even though i nvr completed planning,btohqsg
2020 nuclear planning kenna cancelled ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
it could have been an A,btohqsg
a lvl science subjects r soooo cringe,btohqsg
Luckily as a physics major  i dont have to deal with timed practicals,btohqsg
I still have no idea a month later lol,btohqsg
can even go drink kopi in the middle of experiments,btohqsg
just get the first class next,btohqsg
But man is dropping to 2nd,btohqsg
