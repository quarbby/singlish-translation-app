I really don’t care to pay AF on credit cards if it will pay off,btohqsg
I prefer to use DBS/HSBC/Citi/Standard Chartered.But if you say they can’t provide me what I want so I might consider to open an account in other bank.,btohqsg
Still haven't gotten answers for the other 2 qns  the highest interest rates with just the lack of info would usually be HSBC EGA and SCB eSaver. As long monthly you rotate the monies around.,btohqsg
Guys  what are the best way to invest s&p500 using srs?,btohqsg
Have you checked out this video?https://youtu.be/lvnuh3Ituqw?si=x-exK3qCAB6CbUlo,btohqsg
Endowus got recurring fee every year right?,btohqsg
To answer your questions I’ll say that for the first amount of money I’ll park 5000  then my salary which is 5500 (1700 saving out from the salary every month).I don’t care to change my credit card strategy if I’ll get what I want which is the best way to increase my money by saving approximately 1700 every month.,btohqsg
Is there a way to buy with only 1 time fee?,btohqsg
I wanted to save money with cash back  but rewards or miles will do the job the same If their conversion value is higher than points for anything else I want (miles or money),btohqsg
With just 5000 then HSBC EGA and SCB eSaver would be the only way to go. Don't need to change your credit card strategy as well.,btohqsg
If you can suggest me any other bank accounts (DBS/HSBC/Citi/SCB) plus a good credit card which has the best rewards/miles plan I’ll consider it.,btohqsg
I don’t care of annual fees if I’ll have to pay,btohqsg
Melvyn literally just suggested the bank accounts (HSBC + SCB in combination). You can use any cc you feel like.,btohqsg
With the latest news on youtrip with Apple Pay  does anyone know if I use amaze + Citi or UOB preferred visa platinum  would it give me miles on Apple Pay top-up?,btohqsg
Ok thank you guysHave a good day,btohqsg
Not for SRS. Anyway  forgot that there is an video update for this topic.https://youtu.be/lrfqPsoyj2A,btohqsg
This is confusing. You mean YouTrip top-up? I recall no cards give rewards for topping up YouTrip.,btohqsg
If you park 100k  OCBC 360 account with an eligible OCBC miles/cashback card.If you park 150k  UOB One account with eligible UOB miles/cashback card.,btohqsg
Hello experts  just to check if I use citipayall  the amount does not contribute to the 1k credit card spend right  if I have crmc. Thanks in advance,btohqsg

Wa $450 cash is damn high siah  should have waited haha. Thot $400 was v high Liao$450 can buy brand new ipad 10th gen with change leftover and also miles from credit card lol. Reward is only 9th gen,btohqsg
yeah  just got the notice 30 min ago and updated ithttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/250178,btohqsg
Back in my day it was like 250$ I think. 😅,btohqsg
Yea haha same  should have renewed NTB after then and get another set of rewards now. Cos last time HSBC revo and UOB lady’s can easily cover CRMC’s miles categories. And last time OCBC 365 still got 3% travel cashback de which was good haha.Now CRMC hard to even find replacement for it,btohqsg
Ya these days I can't reset my new to bank status with Citi. After so many nerfs  crmc is like last man standing.,btohqsg
anyone experienced issues getting cc rewards for paying singtel bill thru app recently cuz i realised they started using AXS platform,btohqsg
They changed for few weeks already. Probably will be excluded for a lot of cards.,btohqsg
FYI  I managed to xfer funds out from my HSBC EGA to my another bank acc with same name successfully.,btohqsg
Pay on website  until they changed to AXS also lol,btohqsg
ok nice thank you  will try next month,btohqsg
may I confirm  in-app payment (eg. shopback  shopee  fairprice apps) paired with CRMC is considered as online? dont need amaze + CRMC?,btohqsg
Enter credit card details is online and okay to use CRMC direct. Just don’t use in-app Apple Pay.,btohqsg
I remember in previous videos and discussions  it was said that once the MA reaches the BHS  excess MA contributions will overflow to the SA (supercharge SA)  and once the SA reaches the FRS  any excess SA contributions will overflow to the OA (supercharge OA). Is this not the case anymore? In this video you mentioned that any SA contributions above FRS will not overflow but will be retained in the SA  while only the MA contributions will overflow to the OA.,btohqsg
what if my CRMC card is saved in those apps and I pay by card within the app?,btohqsg
Yes can  as long as not paying through Apple Pay.,btohqsg
"It has never been ""any excess SA contributions will overflow to OA"". Only MA contributions above BHS will supercharge SA  then supercharge OA if FRS reached for SA.",btohqsg
I never said that. But if you found  please point me to the specific video,btohqsg
@MelvynEzi@ChrisHMSGAhhh ok thanks! I guess this has been my longest misconception. 😂,btohqsg
wanna check with the community and see which one will you all pick:1/ spend $500 on CS fresh  foodpanda  gojek with the DBS yuu card (i know u need to hit $600 for the bonus but i can’t 😂)or2/ spend $500 on grab with the dbswwmc (4mpd),btohqsg
Go with the path of least pain and suffering,btohqsg
best advice 🤣 least pain of calculating and estimating,btohqsg
why not meet 600 on yuu?,btohqsg
of cos not affect 1k spend for 10x points,btohqsg
Which card can easy trace the Cashback thru app?,btohqsg
Hi what’s the best cards pairing for miles for everyday expenses if I’m quite new to this ‘credit card game’. Is it still citirewards + amaze?,btohqsg
I max out the Cashback on trust. Need a secondary card. Haha,btohqsg
UOB one Cashback not trackable so looking for other option,btohqsg
Why not just keep an excel sheet?,btohqsg
The trust one better good to track  max 2 day can see the Cashback if eligible,btohqsg
Can this still earn 4 Mpd?,btohqsg
Yes. Nothing much has changed for this combo.,btohqsg
Hi guy asking a theoretical question. I would like to use the $200 Local dining credits from Amex plat card. But wondering if I pay via kris+ with my Amex plat card on it would I still be able to use the $200 to offset my payment ?,btohqsg
Noob question - am going to spend like $8k on iPhones and laptop. Which card is best for rebates or miles?,btohqsg
HSBC live + 3kAmex true cashback 5k,btohqsg
If the shop accepts Kris+ then u can doKris+ and Uob krisflyer cc,btohqsg
If you have dbs card  log in to paylah  you may get the card cashback challenge for$6000 (stack with $4500 spending challenge iykyk)get $600 + $100 cashback,btohqsg
Thanks for your dp. I also just moved out successfully. Same name > $150k. No issue.,btohqsg
What kind of payments / transactions qualify to get hsbc ega 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Hi if i cancelled my cc on 20nov2023  do i need to wait till dec 2024 to become a new user or 21nov2024 onwards is fine? For the 1 year gap requirement,btohqsg
Depends. Only sure way to know is to check ur credit report. Else  I'll give at least 1 month buffer  like apply in Jan 2025  to be safe.,btohqsg
Yup if my credit report says 20 nov 2023 has been officially cancelled,btohqsg
Should i call the bank to check?,btohqsg
No harm to try. Myself  I'd apply in Dec 2024.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how long it takes to receive the CIMB card after applying online?,btohqsg

Hi all! Wish to ask if DBS Yuu have excluded Foodpanda as their partner?I'm not getting the base 10x points for my last 5 transactions using DBS Yuu card. The awarding was 1x point upon purchase  followed by another 1x point few days later (which should be 9x instead).Anyone have the same issue? Thanks! 🤗,btohqsg
I think some mcc was excluded in my spent  lacking $48 to hit my $500 spent. Any advise where i can spent for transaction quick posting? Tia,btohqsg

Thank you! If I have 100k in EGA currently  which day do I transfer it out to esaver? And vice versa?,btohqsg
I recently spent on amazon US (14 Nov) using trust card but didn't get any cashback. Anyone knows what is going on? I thought they usually will give cash back a few days after,btohqsg
So it will be 1 Dec (Sunday) for the coming month? Thanks a lot!,btohqsg
is it under your selected category?,btohqsg
No. But I thought will have the 1% or 1.5%,btohqsg
Hi all  I need to post another $450 worth by the end of month to hit my uob one bonus interest for the month (due to car rental deposit return - I just found out the target to hit this month is 1k+)Does anyone know if buying capitastar vouchers can post within the same day or by next day? Or does anyone have an alternative suggestion for me to quickly post $450 either within the same day or next day?,btohqsg
no 1% or 1.5% if under your selected category. Using Trust cashbscack card (not trust link card)?,btohqsg
yea. Note that it will be dated 2 Dec but still better than say transfer end of month instead,btohqsg
You need to be an admin to do this.,btohqsg
Omg. I did get linkpoints. But I used to get cashback a month back! How do I change back to trust cashback. I don't want the stupid linkpoints,btohqsg
uh  different cards bro. Just use the Trust cashback card next time?,btohqsg
I didn't change my card. How do I tell if it's a cashback or link card?,btohqsg
do u have both trust link card and trust cashback card?,btohqsg
Under credit card it just says trust. How do I tell if it's a link card or a cashback card?,btohqsg
open your trust app and check. Verify by card number.,btohqsg
tap on view and manage  trust cashback card had the word cashback on top right,btohqsg
Okay. Mine must be a link card. Crap. But I actually got cashback in September lol. Thanks a lot people!,btohqsg
is it like $5? if so it is from scratch card,btohqsg
It's $1.88 cashback on 125.15 spending. It looks like 1.5%,btohqsg
lol so strange if u did not have Trust cashback card,btohqsg
Yah it's really strange! Maybe it's a bug in their system or maybe it was because I didn't link to the fair price group app previously or idk what's the reason,btohqsg
How much should i put into my spy each month,btohqsg
Sorry gurus  I was advised to use amaze card for my upcoming spending in jb but I would like to seek your advice I should tag it to my crmc card to earn miles  am I right please? I be paying in store at decathlon jb. Thank you so much,btohqsg

Hi there. I have a question. I'm using crmc + amaze card. If I use the amaze card overseas  am I still subjected to the 3.25% transaction fee?,btohqsg

Can only transfer out to own name,btohqsg
Yes planning to. However  the banks I checked with are charging a fee even for receiving USD 🙁 so I'm keen to know if anyone knows of a fee-free alternative,btohqsg
It is the correspondent bank that usually charges usd10 for transfers.Not able to avoid from what I know.The only time I avoided is when my receiving bank manually gave me usd10 credit to offset the charge. By no means is that a waiver. Is the receiving bank “paying for me”.,btohqsg

Anyone made a booking on Agoda and got a 1% CCY Conversion fee despite paying in SGD? Why so?,btohqsg

Oh anyone tried Tiger broker? 6.8% for 20 *trading *days ? Too good to be true ? I don't see that you are required to maintain funds for 60 days like before   maybe u need to make 10 trades of min 3 USD each   what's your view ?,btohqsg
Hihi anyone knows if DCS credit card can get instant approval ? Aldy holding one card with them.,btohqsg
6.8% is guaranteed. But that is a max amount to put in? Also is the capital guaranteed? Please go through the tnc in total,btohqsg

Can anyone review if I’m right just to summarize for new joiners benefit as well:HSBC revo: calendar monthUOB Lady/one/ PPV : calendar monthAmaze local: calendar monthDbs wwmc: calendar monthCiti crmc: statement month,btohqsg
uob one card rebate is by statement month,btohqsg
May I ask how does the UOB one cashback given?,btohqsg
credited at end of 4th statement month (month after the quarter where the spending is fulfilled) onwards if there is bill on your uob one card statement to be offset,btohqsg
How about using wise to receive  still need to pay $10?,btohqsg
To participate for the uob jan to march promotion  I need to clear my deposit by 30 November?,btohqsg
Hi all  is it possible to add my UOB one cc to both my Apple Pay and my wife’s phone? Since there’s cashback on public transport,btohqsg
Best to clear latest tmr morning.,btohqsg
I’m afraid that there’s a system bug if both of us tap in mrt station together at a same time,btohqsg
Won't. Both have different virtual card number,btohqsg
Every time I tap the wrong device on the reader I have to claim because it recognises as new trip when I tap out. Example is my smartwatch and my phone (linked but because setup separately).,btohqsg
Ok I’ll give it a try tomorrow. The public transport cost won’t reflect directly on the UOB apps right? I tried just now but not shown in the apps,btohqsg
Use SimplyGo app? Will reflect immediately.,btohqsg
Not simplygo  use UOB one cc,btohqsg
Means that I add my credit card to simplygo Apps  then when I tap I go Apple Pay use UOB cc  am I correct?,btohqsg
Will it be an issue if both me and wife added the same UOB cc to our own simplygo?,btohqsg
You can try and tell us what happens,btohqsg
Haha ok sure! Last question  the only way to track my min spend expenses 500 is only through UOB TMRW’s amount used is it?,btohqsg
Esaver SC will it come today ? As 30 is weekend,btohqsg
There’s excel for this? Or need to do our own,btohqsg
If i use amaze (citi) to topup investment platform can earn miles???,btohqsg
Any cons to use amaze w Maybank fnf for spending on offline dining and grocery shopping?,btohqsg
incur 1% amaze fee if exceed monthly 1k spend  any refund may gets confusing  not entitled to promo at merchant for maybank cards.,btohqsg
Ohh.. U mean the welcome promo exclude amaze spending?,btohqsg
did not mean that  why need to use Amaze?,btohqsg
Cos I leave my physical card for my parents to spend in Malaysia,btohqsg
What if w/o Apple Pay then only can use amaze as alternative,btohqsg
Don’t have either.. if the cons is just not to exceed 1k/ mth then I think it’s fine for me.. will monitor closely,btohqsg
yea. btw note that the 8% is capped for $312.5 spend per category,btohqsg
Conclusion  cannot add the same UOB cc on simplygo on different device,btohqsg
Cannot add 1 UOB card on diff phones?,btohqsg
Add on two device Apple wallet can  but when I tried to add on SimplyGo on two device  cannot,btohqsg
Use 1 simply go track can already wat?,btohqsg
Ya ya  just to try will it works on two device 🤣,btohqsg
One more question  sorry if I ask too much  credit card newbie here,btohqsg

I used cardup. Straightforward. No comparison to share though.,btohqsg
Hi  can we apply for another citi credit card and be able to qualify for the S$450 reward promo if we were existing citi card user?,btohqsg
It depends on if you have sufficient cash on top of the monthly average based on the day you withdraw the money.,btohqsg
Thanks Ff  doing this way is it because there’s a cashback cap so I switch to Citi?,btohqsg
The 50 cashback cap only on basic cashback or includes the additional cashback?,btohqsg
How do you check not effect?,btohqsg
Correct  it also fulfill your UoB one account of $500 spend,btohqsg
Basic  but I don’t use UoB one card,btohqsg
what is the objective here? earn rebate/miles/bonus interest?,btohqsg
I called and they say it’s about “cashback” not about “transaction reversal”,btohqsg
Cashback on mrt mcd  sp group bill payment on my UOB  citi rewards for online shopping and general use,btohqsg
ok then the plan is fine assuming you are not going to consistently spend 1k or 2k tier each month on the additional bonus rebate merchants on uob one card.,btohqsg
I used my citi reward+amaze in Malaysia  the rate is fine. Charged SGD 16.3 for MYR 52.80,btohqsg
Hey guys  if i charge my Microsoft 365 to my Citi Rewards card  would i get 4 miles per dollar? Or i need to charge to Amaze instead? Thanks!,btohqsg

Sorry a dumb question guys. I am going to transfer my money from the HSBC ega account to my ocbc account for December. I should only do so tomorrow am I right? Thank you.,btohqsg
actually it depends whether better to have funds in 30 Nov and 1 Dec counted in which account. For the case of ega to ocbc I think it will be better to transfer today before 9pm.,btohqsg
Hi guys  do you have any idea which multi currency card that I can pair with uob lady to earn mileage while spending at overseas? I just note that UOB lady’s card has included Amaze Instarem in its exclusion list. Thank you 🙏,btohqsg
For those who want to clear funds for December (fresh funds promo) do note to do so by today if you want December to be zero-ised. Transferring tonight after 10.30pm will be recorded under 2 Dec,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if there’s any good card to use forparking.sgapp? Is it only AMEX TCB/UOB Absolute cashback? Or have they both been nerfed?,btohqsg
UOB onePosb everydayOCBC FrankHi  do any of the above card have Cashback for simplygo without any minimum spend?,btohqsg
Any no minimum spend card recommend?I heard Maribank and Amaze+Citi rewards is good?,btohqsg
Mean Maribank is the best for no minimum spend simplygo?,btohqsg
SingTel bill payment uses AXS now?,btohqsg
Since beginning of Nov. Use website still okay,btohqsg
You can use UOB Lady’s card for no minimum spend but it’s a bit of a waste if you do that. Transportation needs to be the selected category.If you go for solitaire at least have one more category to clock the cap.Lady’s card cap is $1k  solitaire $2k. It’s 4mpd on the spend.,btohqsg
Yup I am thinking of that but seems like both has its advantages I think. As I do not spend 500 for my ocbc account so my eir is lesser. Thank you for advising.,btohqsg
then better transfer tomorrow or monday both will be dated 2 Dec,btohqsg
How much interest can I earn per year from UOB stash if I have 100 k in the account?,btohqsg
Anything more than 100 k will be 5 % ?,btohqsg

Is this for the UOB Save Up Cash in Promotion?,btohqsg
hey guys  my nov CMRC statement has giro set up  i have also confirmed with cust. svc. and they confirmed it. the due date for the statement is 30 Nov  today. on 28 nov  my HSBC EGA got deducted the amount (i.e.  balance dropped  can see the successful debit transaction) but it hasn't reflected at citi's end i.e.  the due balance is still not $0. i have checked with cust. svc. again and the image is their reply. should i just go ahead and pay the due amount now? but im not very sure about the process of refunding that amount  could someone please advise? thank you!!,btohqsg
This is for UOB nation of savers promotion if it happens. I haven’t see any announcement,btohqsg
just wait for the payment to reach citibank and get updated,btohqsg
hey  thanks for your reply! just afraid to get any interest / fee charged. was this the same for your case too? i honestly think itll just go through but then not very sure thats why im asking 🥲,btohqsg
Hi for uob save up promotion  ex: put 150k for earmark 5month  are we still eligible for monthly bonus interest?,btohqsg
note that there will not be any late fee or interest if it is payment via giro,btohqsg
Thank you. For the amount of 150k calculation  is it average daily balance or final balance?,btohqsg
Does this essentially mark your MAB as 0 for December so if the promotion comes  any funds put into it to end Dec will be considered fresh funds?,btohqsg
which 150k u referring to  the 150k to be depositing by 30 Nov or the 150k m monthly average balance for monthly bonus interest,btohqsg
yes  but there will still be base interest such that the mab will be slightly above $0,btohqsg
What is the MCC code for singtel bill? What is the best cc to use?,btohqsg
Sorry for the questions but I am new to this promo! Do correct me if im wrong  the procedure would be1) Move the required amount u want to earmark out of your UOB account (probably to another bank account) before today 10.30pm2) Wait for announcement in the promotion for Dec3) When the announcement come  fill up this formhttps://forms.uob.com.sg/personal/save/savings-festival.html4. Not sure if there is a wait period after appying? Then transfer back the amount into your UOB account,btohqsg
So must use singtel app for MCC 4814 to earn the rewards by crmc +amaze?,btohqsg
singtel website not app and can use crmc without Amaze,btohqsg
1) yes2) promo announce in Jan (if any)3) 4) follow instructions in the new promo (if any),btohqsg
Anything above will slowly drop from 3% to lower and fast.,btohqsg
There may be changes to bonus awarded with recent reduction of interest rates by banks recently. So read thru the tnc carefully.,btohqsg
Ahh okie  so keep the funds under another account until the new promo is announced?,btohqsg
Wah i forget need to transfer in by 30nov  i just register  anyone know if i can just transfer by 31 dec instead?,btohqsg
yea  in hope there will be a new promo which is best if account is empty in Dec,btohqsg

Withdraw everything and join Jan's promo? If any.,btohqsg
Don’t do bank transfer at last minute. You lose the whole month interest just to get one more day interest. Is it worth it?,btohqsg
Will i still earn points/ rewards if I buy something online and use apple pay or is it better to manually enter in my credit card? Does it matter??,btohqsg
If you have prudential policy  there is standard chartered prudential visa to get points,btohqsg

Use amaze card then you don’t have to worry if it reflect as online,btohqsg

if I'm Trying to make a payment of 1.5k using dbs women card at last day of the month and will it be posted as dec period instead? Is there any bank card that count the rebate in spending date instead?,btohqsg
Unlikely. Depends when it will be posted  that is usually a few days with the settlement.,btohqsg
Unless you wish to do investment for oa. Or buy hse. Then transfer to sa is good in my opinion. Of course others may have different approach. No right and wrong. Ask yourself. No answer is correct answer. everyone have different risk appetite  profile  intention.,btohqsg
So if I already maxed my dbs women card and I should spend after 12am instead on dec 1?,btohqsg

Hello experts. Will banks question if I keep getting huge amounts sent to my account? I’ll be getting my 3rd payout from my trading prop firm and it’s mid 5 figures too. Will they call and ask how I’m getting the money and do I need to declare for taxes? I’m 21 and a full time student.,btohqsg
Cuz too late already. Cutoff time for bank on sat is earlier,btohqsg
do you know is what time? I thought it’s 10pm for everyday (I know only ocbc),btohqsg
lol hsbc is earlier than that,btohqsg
Oh ok…. And I didn’t know sat timing is different,btohqsg
Ah what do you tell them? My total 3 payout hits 6 figures. Do I need declare anything for taxes or?,btohqsg
For me it's due to transferring money around the banks. Also got called for crypto related transactions.,btohqsg
Oh. So what did you tell them?,btohqsg
I have another 25k waiting for payout.,btohqsg
For the crypto transactions I told them it's legit and I not being scammed. For the other transfers I just tell them factually what I'm doing. They not really questioning source of income for my case.,btohqsg
Ah ok. Thank you! I’ll just show them the invoices from the prop firms too then. Just worried they question how a 21 year old got 6 figure transferred.,btohqsg
Not sure about taxes though. Do go read up more.,btohqsg
Okay. Thank you! Helped me breath easier.,btohqsg
I think as long as nothing to hide don't worry just explain accordingly.,btohqsg
Just don't do weird stuff like buying one banana with large amount of money.,btohqsg
Ah ok. I’ll just tell them where and show them the invoices if they ask.,btohqsg
I hate it when first day of the month falls on a Sunday. Makes computation more complex and sometimes have some uncertainty.,btohqsg

Hi  I currently have DBS yuu amex  if I apply for the Visa as well does it mean I can earn rewards $600 x 2?,btohqsg
Yes. Provided u meet the amex minimum as wel. And rewards not $600 x 2. But I presume u typo.,btohqsg
Sorry yeah I meant i can earn up to 18% rewards if I spend $600 each on amex and visa yuu.But i only have one yuu account  so how is it possible for me to benefit 2x 13% bonus rewards?,btohqsg
points from both cards goes to the yuu account,btohqsg
You can link both card in same yuu account.,btohqsg
Why my maybank F&F link with amaze card to using public transport the amount is different. Some more every time tap.also.have 0.1 to charge  but this amount also can't get rewards back. Any once can help to ask it. Thanks,btohqsg
The amaze live chat answer is fx charge  but both of them also sgd why need to charge the fx rate?,btohqsg
That's how SimplyGo charges MasterCard. They will charge 10 cents once every 5 days or if hit $15 accumulated spend  whichever earlier. Then they will reverse that charge and charge the final amount.But why Amaze + Maybank F&F when local? Lol. In fact why even link to Amaze? Once hit SGD cap  can spend at RM for addition cashback.,btohqsg
Because they don't know what they're talking about  not faulting the CSO also  because it doesn't make sense to use Amaze for SimplyGo transactions.,btohqsg
Bcz maybank f&f can't add to Google pay,btohqsg
Do u have any ideas to use maybank F&F in public transport via mobile contactless?,btohqsg
Apple Pay if you have an iOS device or just use the card directly?,btohqsg
Good morning gurus  I would like to seek your opinion please . As I am going to transfer my money from hsbc ega to ocbc today  would I even need to keep the minimum sum inside the account? The reason being my MAB based on the amount I have inside for today would be more than the required mab requirement of 2000. Thank you.,btohqsg
If you calculated that MAB is above $2k then no need.,btohqsg

Just that human A on October November December cannot participate in the latest December January promo. Have to stay on the Oct Nov December promo which will have the same ending month as human B.Both A and B end in December 2024.,btohqsg

Should I start doing the Ega 5-transactions today or tml.Also need the 2000$ transfer in right? Or already counted when I transfer all my fund in ytd,btohqsg

Oh no someone told me can last time…🥲🥲,btohqsg
What are you looking to charge? Why need amaze?,btohqsg
CRMC excludes travel related expense. Exception is grab,btohqsg
Can try OCBC Rewards. Do not need amaze unless overseas and you want to reduce fx charges.OCBC rewards works on departmental stores MCC 5311.If you want to use Amaze + CRMC it works too except travel and hotel related expenses.,btohqsg
Offline shopping can still use amaze combo to earn points if you really want to make it online,btohqsg
Oh nice3.2% + 1%Somehow it got better than nov?,btohqsg
Thanks to the rise in UST10y recently due to the Trump inflation view,btohqsg

Apparently I dug up  premier banking one was 3.5% p.a. in Nov  comparing to miliey's comment on Dec's premier banking 3.2% p.a.,btohqsg
3.4% bonus for November / December cycle is only for above $2m (nobody will keep more than $360k inside)$360k inside only gets 3.05%,btohqsg
Which is the same as $360k for jan/feb = 3.05% bonus interest,btohqsg
Haha I know  but for some reason people want to compare the >2m one. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Doesn't make sense to me either.,btohqsg

uob lady only good for whitelisted MCCs under your selected category.Maybe use Amaze+citi rewards mastercard to get 4mpd capped at 1k in statement month for any offline spend so long mcc not excluded (travel related and public transport etc excluded)  citi rewards without amaze for online spend. I assumed your spending is less than 1k monthly.,btohqsg

Because I am a existing uob card holder so I won't get any rewards from like singsaver. Thank you for the advice Anthony.,btohqsg

I wonder if this messes with ocbc rewards merchant whitelist for lazada.,btohqsg
What do u mean by messes?,btohqsg
Sorry I replied to wrong comment.About Lazada sometimes using 2c2*lazada. Ocbc rewards whitelists Lazada transactions  without caring about mcc (unless 5411). Will ocbc rewards still count those and award 4mpd?,btohqsg
Ya i would assume so plus this quarter 5311 give 6mpd,btohqsg

Hi I got a tax question about donations1) assume annual income is 2800002) donation of $16000 is made giving a relief amount of 40k3) assessable income is now 240k and tax payable is 365504) in a scenario where donations is zero   additional payable tax is 7800.5) conclusion : might as well not do donations still keep 16k-7800=8200? Donations don’t seems worth it,btohqsg
U ok or not? The purpose of donation is not for u to make it such that by donating  u actually pay less tax than if u don’t donate.Your thinking seems to be by donating  u actually game the tax system. U think government born yesterday ah?,btohqsg
If you want tax savings  donation is not the way to go..,btohqsg
Top up to ur loved one  srs contribution and self top up if ur SA still below it,btohqsg
Btw  there is a tax relief cap of 80k  technically with your high income you can do other stuff too.Cpf max 20400Srs 15300Rstu 8000 x 2Personal 1000Not to mention NSmen  kid and other reliefs Technically you don’t need so much donations to hit the cap,btohqsg
I am okay but you seems to have a strong opinion on how other people elect to spend their money. Do i you really need to judge ?,btohqsg
I mean if your main intention is not donation but to get “more” saving,btohqsg
Think of tax reliefs for donations as a thank you bonus.... Should never be part of your tax relief strategy.1. 8k self + 8k parents/spouse/loved ones CPF voluntary contributions2. SRS 15.3k (assuming SGean)Then some spare money to donations if you want to give back to society  but purpose should not be for tax reliefs. And not forgetting  the money donated won't come back to you anymore.,btohqsg
I actually prefer a charitable org gets my money rather than the govt but in this structure I still have to pay the govt on top donations made so financially not great for me .,btohqsg
Understand. Unfortunately the donation x2.5 does give wrong impression on tax savings. So I would say donate as giving back society and not for intention of having less tax to pay,btohqsg
T T Durai and Ming Yi monk will love u deep deep. Go and google every dollar that u donate  how much actually reach the person who needs it.If u want to do good by donating  I recall boys brigade got those big basket outside ntuc. Then u can buy household product and put it there and it will reach the recipients. The last I saw was yesterday at giant tampines. But not sure if it is boys brigade.,btohqsg
I was hoping every tax dollar I didn’t pay would have gone to a charity. That would have been a meaning way to contribute to nation building,btohqsg

Don’t use that card. Use BOC visa infinite. 0.3% for insurance. But u must earn 120k per annum,btohqsg

Actually about cardup it doesn’t seemed that cardup website update the nerf timely right? I’m trying to search for the visa nerf but don’t manage to find it.,btohqsg
There has got to be some source or data points for OP to say that Cardup has been nerfed  otherwise it's just fear-mongering. Visa nerf has be reversed  hence you don't find any news on the website.,btohqsg

If spend 0 on fcy and 2k on sgd contactless  ull still get the max 8k miles? Thanks ppl will go explore amex plat card too,btohqsg
Might be able to. You can try and report back here. Cuz it's eGIRO  setup through CPF and HSBC  and not transfer through GIRO.No harm to try if you already plan to top-up monthly. Or at most cancel if it doesn't work.,btohqsg
Sorry I laugh because I always asked myself the same question. However I tend to do it a bit differently. If my intention is to give back to the society then why should I bother about tax refund. It is good to have but should never be my aim. Having said that it would be perfect if can achieve both. Most importantly I don't earn so much though so my impact ain't so big. Kudos to you to give so much back to the society.,btohqsg

hi wanna check i have UOB One Card and Citi Rewards card which should i use for booking hotel from Agoda? checked on heymax it recommend UOB One  but if i book with citi rewards linked to amaze card i will get 4mpd right?,btohqsg
Did you read tnc for Citi rewards that they don’t give bonus points for travel related expenses?,btohqsg
Amaze doesn’t change the mcc of the transaction  with or without amaze it’s still a travel related transaction and will be excluded from earning bonus.,btohqsg
oo but i saw that it is not in the exclusion list  checked MCC code too its not in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
It is not in the list of mcc which qualifies for bonus points. So other mcc won’t get bonus points right?,btohqsg
But if you are fine with $1 = 1 point which is a bit wasteful,btohqsg
icic so it still can get points just not the 10x. thanks all!,btohqsg
That is correct. You can go YouTube to see videos to learn what cards can fill in the gaps. Ex: UOB Lady with category travel chosen. Spend time to go through so you can make a good choice to maximize your spending.,btohqsg

Yeah I’m not saying don’t do it. But don’t bluff yourself you got a good deal.Be aware you got a lousy redemption valuation but it saved you from paying high cash prices,btohqsg
No lah. It’s not a good deal. But if u really need to travel  using miles might be cheaper than paying cash.,btohqsg
Almost all the credit cards we discuss here win YouTrip,btohqsg
Cpm is cost per dollar?Means if citireward 4 miles per dollar how to convert to cpm?,btohqsg

Yeah all in theory only. Also what’s in tnc may not be what’s really practiced.Just throwing out possibilities.It won’t make sense to maintain $200k every month since you will Lugi the 1% incremental interest.Stupid mechanics,btohqsg

I'm exploring at changing my uob one credit card to other better cash back cards. However  this will affect the interest rate I'm receiving for my uob one account. I place a premium on convenience and not having to track spending by having only one primary credit card. Anybody has any advice in whether I should replace my uob 1 card?,btohqsg
Why dont u calculate the interest u would receive with uob one acc and uob cashback vs new cc cashback %,btohqsg
This is the most backward service by HSBC. The moment you own 1 of their product  your next bank account sign up must go down physically. I’m so annoyed,btohqsg
Spend the minimal 500 on uob1 cc then. Anything else you can use better cashback cards like DCS,btohqsg
If i not wrong  you still need to go down to the bank to register your signature if you plan to earn the ega giro 1% cb.,btohqsg
Just google oem u input the info and rate for each company will show liao. Cc rebate really based on the promo with each company. So u have to do your own research,btohqsg
Cannot waive. Just pay and get miles for renewal.,btohqsg
Hi just need a quick input  how to check if UOB new sign up points bonus still available. It shows for first 100 only .,btohqsg
no way to check. should go for uob cc with sure get sign up bonus instead,btohqsg
Thanks for waiting. As of checking  your card registration was via Singsaver. There will be no rewards point welcome gift will be awarded. However  from the second year onwards  we'll waive the annual fee for your card if you spend more than SGD25 000 per year. You will also receive 10 000 miles (in the form of 25 000 Reward points) when you pay for your annual fee from the second year onwards. The Reward points will be credited to your account within the next 2 to 3 months after the annual fee is charged to your card. Valid till 31 December 2024.,btohqsg

sorry I tried to search the chat for 5944 and it seems that for Citi rewards we should be able to get 4mpd for 5944 transactions? but when I search the tncs 5944 doesn't seem to be inside. Is it because if I pair with amaze it will automatically qualify as a transaction eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Amaze does not change the mcc code,btohqsg
You get 4mpd on CRMC for online transactions (except mobile wallet and travel-related). Amaze converts an offline transaction to an online one  hence you are able to get 4mpd.,btohqsg
@antonio191203there's a need for incremental increase to reach that 4.05% so it's not a purely put for a month and get 4.05% so it does not work for me. thanks for your suggestion,btohqsg
Bonus is not in same month anyway.,btohqsg
It IS put for a month and get 4.05% p.a.When you open a fresh new account  anything you put in IS incremental funds.,btohqsg
Yes  but from last month should appear this month  right?,btohqsg

Just double check in Rewards tab in app  only have Earned and Returned,btohqsg
Is amyone using singtel direct billing carrier? I cannot locate it for huawei,btohqsg
My original statement is bonus and base point is seperated which is not wrong by itself. So if u only see base in app also is a improvement isnt it. I also reply to anthony that bonus is not included. So i dont see why the scrutiny by u when i am sharing new update?In the first place i did not even say bonus point is inside?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA and SC Esaver 30-day rule for fresh funds  has it been enforced already? i remove funds on 1 Nov. I seems to be within the 30 day rule for the promotion starting on 1 Dec.,btohqsg
