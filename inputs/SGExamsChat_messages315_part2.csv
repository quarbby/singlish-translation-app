Hi everyone! I launched the original university telegram chat bots many months back (https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/npt4sw/university_telegram_bots_for_random_convos_w/) and now with the JAE period in mind (and the introduction of additional features)  I am expanding them to the JCs  Polys and Secondary schools as well.If you are considering a particular JC or a particular Poly course  you can join as a “incoming student” and try matching with seniors! If you’re a current student in a sec sch/jc/Poly  you can help incoming students out  match with random schoolmates/those of other schools to make new friends  or find study buddies!Do check them out below!JC:@JuniorCollegeBotPoly:@PolyChatBotSec Sch:@SecondarySchoolBotI have introduced the option of student email verification and the choice to match only with those with student emails—this minimises the risk of abuse. You’ll still be anonymous to other users.The university bots also have newer versions(if you are waiting to enter uni  you can also choose to join as an “incoming student”!)@nusmatchbot@ntumatchbot@smumatchbotwhich allow you to match w ppl of specific majors/year.(the older versions @nuschatbot @ntuchatbot @smuchatbot @susschatbot @SITxSUSSbotare still running too!)Do remember to stay safe—while risks of abuse are minimised with the option of student email verification  it’s not entirely foolproof. Use the/reportfeature or DM me directly if you need any help!If your student email address doesn’t work for some reason  drop me a message too. :)[msg sent w admin approval],btohqsg
^ thanks!!p.s. there might be some lag due to a sudden influx of new users!Drop me a msg if you face any glitches/issues :),btohqsg
Not yet! I’ll be releasing them for other institutions (ITEs and the other unis for e.g.) soon though! :)You can follow@unichatbotchannelin the meantime for announcements on this!(https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/s4gqq8/junior_college_poly_telegram_bots_for_jcs_polys/),btohqsg
