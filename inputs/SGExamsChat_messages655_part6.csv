Idk if it’s just me but I feel that HCI students tend to be more humble than ri,btohqsg
aptitude > attitude in the sense that udn study as hard,btohqsg
Ri arts students have insane writing speed lol,btohqsg
U write 2 side they write 5 side liao,btohqsg
if they have insane writing speed,btohqsg
then idk what my writing speed is,btohqsg
Does your handwriting get rly ugly when you write fast though,btohqsg
i still have some of my gp exam papers lying arnd,btohqsg
its better than some peoples normal writing speed,btohqsg
Oh well so I guess at least you didn’t have to worry about whether Cambridge examiners can read your handwriting,btohqsg
Some ppl I know of they get like B/C for a levels arts subjects even though their prelims was like A  and they suspect it’s a handwriting issue,btohqsg
If a levels did at least reveal the exact marks of each student and the grade boundaries (just like IB) then would be easier to tell,btohqsg
no for ur case i do,btohqsg
Thing is some of them were likely consistently in the top quintile for all internal exams then suddenly A levels is a C,btohqsg
yea there's like a line to draw here,btohqsg
"""write legibly so the marker can see your beautiful thoughts or smth""",btohqsg
even if you gave me your script i wouldn't be able to cheat off it,btohqsg
Maybe some of them legit screwed up their As but can’t be all given their prior good performance,btohqsg
i feel acjc marking q inconsistent,btohqsg
Yalor. At least UK a levels reveal the exact grade boundaries for all papers,btohqsg
It’s not just my sch tho,btohqsg
I’m talking about cases from vjc and ejc,btohqsg
Like I know of ppl who internal exams almost always A but come a levels B/C,btohqsg
the past 3 years there was one drop to B,btohqsg
but its cause she blanked out for one essaay,btohqsg
its probably the worst in singapore,btohqsg
He always A in internal exams but a levels B,btohqsg
I actually dk how they fuck up so much,btohqsg
Do you know what was it for 2021?,btohqsg
Wow so even despite that BOP fiasco  the results were still pretty decent,btohqsg
That’s like on par with hci/ri,btohqsg
They also normally say their Econs dist rate is around 60%,btohqsg
Only ri students should be scholars!!!,btohqsg
Hci is the 4th China  Singapore is the 3rd,btohqsg
i only know 1 who is my upperstudy,btohqsg
and i think hes pretty decent person,btohqsg
apart from the fact that he stole my things,btohqsg
But pretty incredible for your sch to produce Econs results that are on par with hci/ri despite the crappy dept,btohqsg
i suspect we have very little Bs,btohqsg
I thought even other schs with the same cut off didn’t have an Econs dist rate that’s as high,btohqsg
ej has very little students in tuition,btohqsg
of the 3 classes im close to,btohqsg
That probably applies more to dhs,btohqsg
Acjc Econs dist rate is always very crappy,btohqsg
I think it was 29% for 2022,btohqsg
but its no where near ac,btohqsg
So despite being one point better for each stream Acjc’s results are so much worse,btohqsg
idk why ej is dropping tbf,btohqsg
Wait its only one year off,btohqsg
Probably new campus and good results,btohqsg
