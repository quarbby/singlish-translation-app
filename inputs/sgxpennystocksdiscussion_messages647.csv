Prepare to pay more for groceries liao. By making it easier to compare prices  esp online  retailers can tacitly collude to increase prices. Those that read game theory before should know what I am talking about.Thinking of buying Dairy Farm and Sheng Siong to use the dividends to offset pending price increase.Hope PAP can come in and stop this... Inflation and cost of living alr so high  now they want us to pay even more really knn.,btohqsg

Now retailers can engage price war still,btohqsg
Like for the recent eggs one,btohqsg
Now that their prices from their website all gg to be integrated into app  any cheating can easily be detected and retaliatory actions taken,btohqsg
Now retailers have more easier time to compare prices,btohqsg
Ofc there's the case where some ppl will still go to certain supermarkets for whatever reason  like distance or membership,btohqsg
Ya which is why prices will increase,btohqsg
Why would they want to fight themselves when they can makan the consumer?,btohqsg
I mean the ppl in Dairy Farm  NTUC and Sheng Siong I believe are smart enough,btohqsg
But consumers will suffer. This is my PoV,btohqsg

As for the basket.. It's never really disclosed.. But you can guess,btohqsg
Heng I no money buy property at all,btohqsg
Sorry to say but Malaysian property not so good to buy for investment unless ownself living. Rental returns is so bad worse if capital depreciation. They hv so much more land compared to Singapore so cannot compare prices Lah,btohqsg
Yes . They buy for own stay,btohqsg
Aiya Sam don’t like that leh. You are doing fine 👌,btohqsg
Actually if can wait I think can buy cheaper when current owners cannot afford to pay installments forced sell. I’m Singapore too but now global so uncertain if can delay better delay I think,btohqsg
Own stay also die .. every month their salary is fix,btohqsg
Wait. These hot cycle one. Meanwhile save your money first ☺️,btohqsg

This generation only seen Low interest rate which has been abnormal for so long including negative interest 😩😂😂😂,btohqsg
Yes ..  but I can tell this likely will come back soon . Maybe another 3 to 4 year time,btohqsg
Cham cant remember think was in 2009 ..,btohqsg
I think so too bcos too many bubbles  too much leverage n global economic growth no good. Hardly any more Low level growth engines now,btohqsg
Those keep buying and buying property without a stand by cash . Good luck,btohqsg
Even if hv standby cash if crash how much can you tahan 😂😂😂,btohqsg

Yea.. usually pocket deep is pay at least 50 to 60 down payments ..,btohqsg
Wait slowly for next chance ☺️ but I think must wait long long bcos this time global bubble too big take very long time to recover I think,btohqsg
Then where you park your money now ? 🤔,btohqsg
Some physical precious metals n cash slowly buy when price down. I think gold silver can preserve value n easily sold. Actually I made money liow. I bought when usd weak against s$ and metal prices Low.,btohqsg
Don’t buy too big weight bcos you don’t want to liquidate so much at one time. You only need to liquidate what you need to use in future. I buy 1oz gold. For silver I buy 100oz bar. Don’t pay for design etc pay high premium for it. For gold with design premium not big so is ok but not silver. Silver is industrial n precious metal n before fiat money people made payments with silver. Don’t buy paper or cert type dangerous bcos not fully backed. Not convert all cash to this but a portion of your portfolio lah,btohqsg
Oh yea .. good idea .. 👍👍 thank for sharing,btohqsg
Physical Silver damn heavy to bring to metal exchange to cash out,btohqsg
but worth its weight compared to gold,btohqsg
1oz Gold can buy 80oz of silver,btohqsg
When I bought it was $2.3k then it peaked at almost $4k within 6 months but of course sale price was less than $4k. Silver’s buy sell spread is much bigger than gold so need to up more before profit but I buy to keep to preserve value of my money savings I no sell type. Warren buffet does not like gold silver bcos he says does not generate money fast enough. Maybe bcos he buys n sells in USD whereas we buy in USD converted to s$ n sell in s$ so hv currency conversion  lol,btohqsg
Can bring Gold/Silver bars from/to overseas?,btohqsg
Malaysia pro leh  do false account pay fines only,btohqsg

So many bottom deviation w reversal signal 🚦 wbullish harami.. example: RR,btohqsg
Firstly we are supposed to be an open economy so controls supposed to be Min. Secondly so much global money flooding all Govts want to catch such easy money into their coffers n it supports many jobs in economy from legal  banks etc. with this income Govt hv more money to spend in country for citizens too n delay taxing n less tax rate if without this income. Thirdly property prices go in cycles  ups n downs. Impt is don’t be greedy FOMO go chase till sky high prices which is now. Everyone has to be level headed to make careful purchase decisions. Cannot blame Govt or anyone bcos no one force you to buy. We are too small a country  this is easy money for Govt not to make n take. HK is similar country but look at their property prices n ownership there. How they are jealous of us here in SG. Now after collecting lots  they implement controls later already. For me I would do the same 😂,btohqsg
Just feel sorry for those youngsters keep complaining no money to buy house  eg our@Samandham,btohqsg

I understand but actually many people who bought properties at Low prices before profit so much when they sold for their retirement n share with next generation too. It is how you use the profit money,btohqsg
We always do not hear those who profited except those who lose out or lost,btohqsg
haha... so those with many children sorry liao  each got lesser...lol,btohqsg
Current situation Singapore is unlivable on a living wage,btohqsg
Yalor .. feel sad for them  ..,btohqsg
When will be cement time bro?,btohqsg
But nowadays families hv fewer children lah,btohqsg
Another reason. Mtf manage well. Lich ppl flock to sg,btohqsg
Many countries the same if not worse,btohqsg
People tends to think last time was easier. My start pay as a IT grad was only 1.7k and my first hdb was 300k+.... In proportion  not much better than now,btohqsg
Our generation just quietly worked hard  pay loan and support parents,btohqsg
Yes we too had difficulties our pay so much smaller than now n so few jobs,btohqsg
Yes we don’t spend so much n so lavishly like many young people now where got go hotel buffet coffee house Makan etc  kept saving  don’t even talk of going for overseas holiday,btohqsg
And my batch was worst  we were receiving around the same as prev batches but housing shot up when we needed to buy  because of the valuation thing,btohqsg
Not yet....I also don't know. Watchlist,btohqsg
🙏 maybe if you flip up 28. BBs come heeh,btohqsg
Last time we don't drink coffee bean and starbucks coffee,btohqsg
Ya Lor. Till now I don’t not even Kopi shop. I buy 3-in-1 ownself drink,btohqsg
ck should be here...hahaha  so cannot post too much,btohqsg
I like their lifestyle. Come here earn. Go back spend. Purchasing power greater.,btohqsg
Luckily me n my husband dare dare buy when the opp. Came ..,btohqsg
Just make sure we clear all debts by retirement and got fund for our retirement,btohqsg
Yes. Always our aim no matter how much sacrifices,btohqsg
Now kids so lucky  parents all ready to fund our own retirement.,btohqsg
Haiz but will they know how to preserve their money bcos just given to them. For Sam I no worry bcos he is very careful n down to earth. ☺️,btohqsg
Really is difficult time. Interest rate up not good for shares  keep cash cannot match inflation  jialat,btohqsg
That is why our parents taught us not every day is Sunday. Must know how to save for rainy day,btohqsg
You all keep comparing with the past,btohqsg
Now kids think differently. Go cafe  tailored clothings....,btohqsg
I want to encourage you wait for next cycle n save your money till then,btohqsg
Being borned in Singapore and during this time is the best already,btohqsg
To have gone through it and say times were tougher then than now,btohqsg
I have a few choice words,btohqsg
Times are not tougher now or back then,btohqsg
Yes  Sam. Think housing price should be coming down in a couple of years. Save up and be ready,btohqsg
Still not gonna buy a shoebox,btohqsg
just buy hdb  don't buy condo,btohqsg
Maybe 250k for 3 room resale I buy,btohqsg
With grant and subsidy should be quite ok,btohqsg
Maybe bah. Need wait for that one. I go slowly queue.. 2 room maybe 150k at most I'm willing,btohqsg
I agree. I feel buy private hv to spend so much more buy price n incur unnecessary expenses not worth it,btohqsg
I also think can. Do you know I paid down payment for my sister’s lakeshore 99yrs opposite mrt station during Asian financial crisis price was only around $400k? So at crisis prices can tank so just wait.,btohqsg
Married ones also take help from parents,btohqsg
No parents help also gg lor,btohqsg
😂 we see different group  last time starting pay is like 2.5k. Now their starting pay is $4.5k to $7k,btohqsg
Last time my fish ball noodles also 2.5,btohqsg
Yeah inflation. Proportionate. Think older folks harder hit cos difficult to find work.,btohqsg
I think buy hdb your cpf can pay liow,btohqsg
So you save now lor you shd easily save for down payment only 10% mah,btohqsg
Jialat for older folks like me. Younger ones Govt will take care 😐,btohqsg
This applies to everyone during good or bad times leh ☺️ so thankful Govt keeps attracting overseas investors n companies here lor despite difficult times now,btohqsg
Don’t be so pessimistic lah 😔,btohqsg
malaysia property can only buy for stay  nv ever for investment,btohqsg
with so high inflation data  can hoot property is e best.. good hedge,btohqsg
Slowly lah  just take 15-20 yrs loan. As your salary increase  you can go make lumpsum repayment,btohqsg

AHC dividends $0.0042. At least something,btohqsg
Abundance Stuck in the range $0.029 to $0.034 for some time. If no market wide crash  i don’t see it breaking below $0.029.If break  means it goes to rest.If global markets recovers strongly  can expect it to test the resistance $0.034 in time. (Not soon  depends on the overall market sentiments),btohqsg
