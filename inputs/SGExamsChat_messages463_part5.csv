idk  if you have looked up the career pathway to become a jc teacher over a uni lecturer,btohqsg

they were taught to teach differently  cant really compare them like that,btohqsg

a jc teacher or a uni lecturer...which career path is longer,btohqsg
uni lecturer means undergrad -> phd (sometimes masters too) -> years of postdoc work -> pray you get uni offer,btohqsg
