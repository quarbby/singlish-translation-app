Monthly average balance *5% will be the bonus points pool. Then each dollar spend will give you 4 or 5 points from the pool till its used up. Something like that,btohqsg
Dividend stocks you are expose to large price volatility etc.Comparing to money market fund which give you 5%The price is somewhat within an expected range or super low volatility.For a dividend investor if you have a lower risk return of 5% rate why would want to expose yourself to higher risk of a stock which give you the same 5% return ? Most people would offset the higher risk and aim at higher return at a 3-4% higher for comparing to lower risk or risk free rate.It depends on what you are looking to invest and what is your style of investing.Please do look into why people buy certain asset classes. It important to ensure you are comfortable with certain risk level.,btohqsg

Can anyone tell me. What is e steps to use endowus to invest cpf OA to spy? Now Prudential advise me to invest in their India market fund 30% rtn. Should use endowus myself n do e spy thingy or prudential India market fund 30%?,btohqsg
They (Prudential) actually tell you that??? ü§£Have you downloaded Endowus app and linked your CPF-IA yet?,btohqsg
Show your agent on this. What happens if the fund tanks? Will they guarantee to cover up the loss? If they do that  I will switch my fund over as it is all under prudential üßê,btohqsg
Haha you should pull up India equity fund. It's 25% up past 1 year  but that doesn't mean it's 30% p.a. every year. ü§£,btohqsg
That is a better idea. And we should ask the agent if they guarantee yearly return of 30% in black and white üôÉ,btohqsg
"Maybe can check withDawnif they said ""guaranteed"". I think it's not even legal to say so",btohqsg
I be very surprised if they willing put that down. But we just want to highlight the risk of these funds and not take their words for granted. No offense  some will just take their commission without your interest considered.,btohqsg

Never invest with insurance agent.Use discount broker buy spy yourself if u are a little savvyUse endowus buy spy if u don‚Äôt know how to use brokersOf course this assumes u know and understand the risks of investing in spy.,btohqsg
Someone pm me to ask why I said‚ÄúNever invest with insurance agent‚ÄùThese are my thoughts:1. Insurance agents are only good for insurance. Case closed. Investments should be done by investment professionals which they are not.2. The commissions charged by Insurance agents for investments are not only excessively high  but they are charged upfront which handicaps your Investment starting point.3. The instruments that insurance agents use to do your investments are typically inefficient and designed to maximise fees and lock in periods. Eg investment linked policies  investment bundled with insurance into one co-mingled mess.,btohqsg
"Agree mostly. But i think investments sld be done by educating ourselves. The ""professionals"" the avg person has access to are not there to serve u. U r jus a sales target for them.",btohqsg
