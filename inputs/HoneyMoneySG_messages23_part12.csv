No idea. I applied to be invited but still waiting,btohqsg
Hmm it depends  itâ€™s 3.48% of not doing anything extraWhy not?,btohqsg
how to make payment from GXS account?,btohqsg
hm send money can get 1.2Ã— grabpoints?,btohqsg
yea  so how to make payment using GXS?,btohqsg
idk  I'm not on GxS yet,btohqsg
I saw seedly gxs like not worth bothering about. Unless something has changed?,btohqsg
Any idea does paying Singtel Bill online (not recurring) considered as online spend for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
GxS is a great option for people who have no salary to credit and have less than $300 spending per month,btohqsg
You have to wait for an invite from them,btohqsg
Can register interest by leaving your contact details on GxS app,btohqsg
since uob absolute cashback cc has nerfed of grabpay  is there any need to apply for this card for 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
1.7% is still the highest unlimited cashback rate provided the place accepts Amex. Useful for big ticket purchases. But otherwise not much use,btohqsg
yes eh  it's just amex is a little nerfðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Think he means Amex is 1.5% vs UOBâ€™s 1.7% is a 0.2% nerf lol,btohqsg
Your grab wallet will have a payment option to use GXS,btohqsg
So basically grab will just directly deduct straight from GXS,btohqsg
Hi all  do yall know if I can pair HSBC revo / UOB PPV with favepay for hawker payments and still earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
HSBC Revo should earn (counts as online)not sure about UOB PPV,btohqsg
without grab pay amex tcb is kinda nerf lah. because maybank bacelona and citi cashback+ totally peak amex true casback,btohqsg
I got my invite like start of the week,btohqsg
Though grab ran into the red it's delayed,btohqsg
But the account still limited to $5k,btohqsg
So if you max out in pocket $5k  you canâ€™t use it anyway,btohqsg
Cause they deducted at saving account,btohqsg
yes wads the perk of gxs,btohqsg
Current is boosted earning rate for their point when using the account for grab and singtel dash and 3.82% but max out $5k,btohqsg
So must top up in cash and use it,btohqsg
Not by using credit cards like Grab,btohqsg
Yes it basically just a like a bank account link,btohqsg
You can direct deduct from GXS,btohqsg
So like this set as primary payment,btohqsg
Top up by fast transfer I guess,btohqsg
Like let say you already have money and using GXS as a bank account,btohqsg
It just direct deduct and you still earn points,btohqsg
Like a bank I guess so the card like a debit,btohqsg
Oh I try it still under invite okyl not really Open to all,btohqsg
For some who had fully utilised the $30k annual limit for grab  this UOB Abs 1.7% is still the next best option for cashback,btohqsg
Does DBS Woman's World card get 4mpd when using SimplyGo?,btohqsg
I end up with amex over uob cos the cashback given is within the same month statement while uob has to wait for next month. 1 point to consider as well.,btohqsg
eh im wondering if any foreigner has successfully apolied a maybank credit card  i apply several times  all ends up rejected. i want the platinum visa cardðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ya amex so fast cash back return to u,btohqsg
U meet the requirements or maybe credit score low,btohqsg
i think my annual income is qualify. idk where to see my credit scoreðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If u got rejected u can ask for a Free credit score,btohqsg
Maybe in SG u don't have a record to start with,btohqsg
Try apply other card first to built up your reputation,btohqsg
Pick Those u can LoR better not anyhow spam application,btohqsg
Cimb is One no fee too,btohqsg
The whole think still under beta,btohqsg
