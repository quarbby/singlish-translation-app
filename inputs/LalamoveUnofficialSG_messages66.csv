Yes  I think has to be across all platforms  now it's common to see $4+ fees for bicycle on grab  Panda and Roo. That has some pull down effect.For cars  regardless if you sending pax or goods  must be enough to earn $30/hr nett. Consider you work 8-10 hours for 6 days  less car cost and petrol will nett you $3-4k + for that  consider the risk like accidents we have to face,btohqsg
It wun work. Some guys vehicle on rental. Everyday is money down the drain,btohqsg

Will have $10-$15 if they want pick up and deliver now. But this one is mostly between 10am-6pm. So the fare not so high,btohqsg
More like parcel. Parcel price no good,btohqsg
Who say . Suay suay take one covid passenger. Your whole family need to quarantine... ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Ya lor. I only did once. Used it as how I use hitch,btohqsg
Okok  I go sign try try  haaha,btohqsg
This can stack order and send any time is it?,btohqsg
Some between 10-1. Some 10-6. Depending on the customer r,btohqsg
Longer the time frame. The cheaper it is,btohqsg
So can stack as many order as we can as long as we send within the time frame??,btohqsg
Some have advanced booking. Like today 2 July. Some 3rd July order. But AJ is damn Low. Like $4 bucks from Bedok to yishun,btohqsg
You can stack 10 if you want and send within time frame,btohqsg
But you go pick up 10 places also tiring,btohqsg
Got take from 1 place n send to many address. Or all door to door 1 parcel,btohqsg
long time frame jobs exclude on-demand food delivery  which is where the volume is.,btohqsg
Like that time consuming n tiring for peanuts,btohqsg
Unless heng Heng they have 3 parcel lor. From what I checked  seldom have. Nearby have. But same place more than 1 parcel don‚Äôt have,btohqsg
Rather u take hitch sua go the place u want,btohqsg
Sometimes on the way I pick one parcel up then go to the place I want lor. $7.5. Better than nothing. Use it as a hitch at least won‚Äôt go overthink so much,btohqsg
Better than hitch . At least u won't get quarantined fetching the parcelü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Yah. Usually small item la. Contact lens etc. Those people online shopping kind of parcel,btohqsg
If tiao kang need go diff places pick up then is bohua,btohqsg

Ya lor . Wait if got children cannot go school Dio quarantined jialat. ÂÆ≥Ê≠ªÂÖ®ÂÆ∂üòÇüòÖ,btohqsg
Anyway did a few viamove. Personally find it bohua. 40-45 mins for pick up and drop off. Less than $10,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt say stack la. Per order like that do not worth,btohqsg
Unless if the customer order is consistent take all his parcel and deliver. Under table hehe,btohqsg
Want stack no scared. Want scared no stackü§£,btohqsg

They want u to buy is to let u be 'invested' a bit  like y llm ask for deposit.Imagine anyone can just open acc without upfront cost  then those got spare sim card will just create acc  take the job and sapu the food,btohqsg

We understand where you are coming from and we have already instructed our tech department to change the order-taking logic for this new app.We would want to reward the good drivers and penalise the bad drivers who were late due to the stacking of orders. Unfortunately  as there has been a huge increase in the number of late orders  our customers have requested that the orders not to be stacked at all. From the customer's perspective  they would not know if the driver who is stacking is an experienced and responsible driver or an overconfident driver who will be late for the deliveries. As long as the orders are stacked  there is a higher risk for the orders to be late.Previously when we reached out to drivers for stacking of orders would be last year during the festive periods where there was an abundance of orders. With that said  we were also able to determine which order was suitable for the driver to stack.We hope with this explanation you are able to better understand the reason for our current shift in policy and stance.,btohqsg

@D_e_w_yI understand LLM's standpoint. They should implement a system where stacking is disabled for a certain period (punishment) for multiple late deliveries due stacking. For those who stack and deliver with no problems  it should be encouraged and allowed (reward),btohqsg
Oh well..we are small fry..feedback regarding the app also no improvement,btohqsg
It will require them to monitor all the drivers  I doubt they will want to do so much work,btohqsg
What I want to know is  can we stack 1 job with another immediate job. Since immediate job upon accepting we have 30mins to reach üòÇ,btohqsg
[ORDER STACKING]Dear xxx  your account was found to have stacked orders on the 1st of July.Kindly be informed that the management is closely monitoring the punctuality of orders  and lateness resulted from stacking could lead to a temporary suspension of your account. Therefore  please do not stack orders that are less than 30 minutes apart. Thank you.,btohqsg
According to llm  as long as the job is not more than 30mins apart from pickupüòÇ,btohqsg
Damnit 1st July I never stack also say I stack,btohqsg
Got a job 6pm and 6:30pm difference pickup place also,btohqsg
Then bloody how to do now sia this llm  want to ban driver and eat depo ?,btohqsg
We are worthless to them. They have the monopoly. So what to do??,btohqsg
Quite easy to filter out the data if they want to. There are responsible stackers who make LLM more efficient. Anyway I'll still stack until they start suspending üòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe they means u have to pick drop pick drop  kenot pick pick drop drop?,btohqsg
Now 7 orders all same  don't give priority tips,btohqsg

Just remember we have 55-60mins to drop off,btohqsg
N normally oddle jobs will show the timing to be delivered,btohqsg
When I see such receipt  I will tell the restaurant better call the customer n inform them just got driver. Or I will call the customer myself,btohqsg
Just tell customer wat time the food picked up,btohqsg
