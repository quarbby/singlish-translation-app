hey! does anyone know where to get amath topical practices?,btohqsg
aside frm tys - i only hve the yearly series which is compilation of all topics,btohqsg
rather practice on each topic individually first,btohqsg
Doesn't Add. Math TYS have the topical series?,btohqsg
idk wasn't under my list of books (fas)ill check againbut are there other ways?,btohqsg
nah i js get stuff under fas  otherwise i dn bother,btohqsg
last time i bought some sort of practice book  it went to waste,btohqsg
if you have yearly TYS then you dont really need topical TYS tbh,btohqsg
HmmHow about ask your teacher to give you some practice papers topics by topics?My Chemistry and Math teachers gave us like that when I was in secondary school,btohqsg
If your teacher is unable to do so  then I would suggest you to continue with TYS  but do in a topical wayLike e.g. you want to do chapter 1  then find the questions related to chapter 1,btohqsg
o wow okie thank you guys,btohqsg

Anyone here gone through the PFP route for Poly? Im currently in PFP and im quite worried that im gonna be kicked out because i didn‚Äôt do well for Math üò≠,btohqsg
which poly are you studying in rn,btohqsg
But don't you keep ur place in pfp as long as you pass everything?,btohqsg
if you fail one module you‚Äôre out,btohqsg
im worried i failed math lol  i got lucky with a B3 in N Level despite failing math from Sec 1 to 4,btohqsg
so i got into PFP and my classmates mostly took O-level math while my math is pretty bad,btohqsg
I mean the semester is going to end soon,btohqsg
So if you are sure that you are going to fail the math module  i think its a good idea to start looking for alternative education options,btohqsg
Its too late to drastically change your module grades now imo  im not sure how the module is graded,btohqsg
nah dw bout it just keep doing ur best,btohqsg
If there is a final exam  maybe you can,btohqsg
i ended the semester already  my results are coming out in 1.5 months time,btohqsg
ive got a 2 months holiday,btohqsg
im not sure if im gonna fail because i heard borderline fail would be pushed up to a pass as most schools want a 100% pass rate for PFP,btohqsg
I hate presentation back when I touch pfp,btohqsg
my marks probably in the 43-55 marks range so idk if it‚Äôs considered borderline  this is gonna be stressing me out for 2 whole months üò≠,btohqsg
Well that's abit more to Passing,btohqsg
im doing business so have math  i can‚Äôt change course also,btohqsg
Well then just do revision from what Ur lecture teach ah,btohqsg

hello... Nice to meet you kou,btohqsg
how r u on the same bell curve as me :D,btohqsg
what is bell curve uwu...? o.o,btohqsg
hey guys! i just wanna ask  since i eae'ed to to tp common business programme  how do you make trustworthy and reliable friends in tp biz school? i heard that in tp biz school there are a lot of 'snakes'/toxicpeople. i'm quite the introvert and i have trsut issues sometimes,btohqsg
*if i actually enter tp biz school,btohqsg
what you heard applies to every business school,btohqsg
as a rule of thumb in poly  yes theres snakes so js be aware of it but dont like let it stop you from making friends yk,btohqsg
idk how to say it  but like dont keep thinking everyone is a snake because even though there are a lot of snakes and/or toxic ppl  rly not everyone is like that,btohqsg
and speaking of peer evaluation in group project which is a common area for snakes to thrive  most of the time if u make sure u do ur part  contribute to ur group and itll be fine,btohqsg
from experience most people wont mark you down just bc they have something against you or what not,btohqsg
okie dokie thank you so much!,btohqsg
poly student here  there are so many many people in poly that you will meet  it's not right to generalize them all negativelyyeah there are some people you might not like but that's fine because not everyone will like everyoneat the end of the day you can always just find new people to talk to (even if it's the 20-ish in your class I'm sure there are at least a few people you can befriend)if you are having trouble during group work just remember it's temporary and don't hate your groupmates just because of how they act during group projects  at the end of the day projects are stressful situations and not everyone is gonna be at the best behavior  everyone might make mistakes and that can always be you as well,btohqsg
Actually  not just business school  can also be in any school. Even my school (school of applied science) at RP also has toxic people. It's by your luck.Even lecturer can be toxic (but this is rare)For project work  even if you have a toxic teammate  you always have to bear with it  or else everybody in your team might lose marksAnd yes  although you might meet toxic people in poly  don't assume that all people are toxic people and you treat them badly  or else everybody doesn't like you,btohqsg
or just make acquaintances/friends in class that arent close friends,btohqsg
class 'friends' only help so you wont be so lonely in class,btohqsg
not something special but without them class would suck,btohqsg
or like with schoolwork too but if ur close friends same sch or even btr same course u cld ask them too lol,btohqsg
yeahCCA is also another way to meet ppl,btohqsg
For lecturer who is a toxic person treats you very badly  just complain to the programme chair/managerI know you might be thinking that if you complain to the programme chair/manager about how your toxic lecturer treated you badly  your toxic lecturer might purposely give you bad gradesBut  just complain  or else your toxic lecturer's behaviour might keep affecting your mentally and make you think that you can't do well for the moduleBut for your teammates  just bear with them (I mean if they're toxic to you)  or else you might be the one who is suffering more worseI know it would be hard for you to know who to trust and who to not trust  but poly life is like that  but I believe that you will be able to survive during 3 years of poly life,btohqsg
Hey juniors those who took O level Mid year mother lang ! ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR RESULTS!!,btohqsg
All the best to my juniors :),btohqsg
Shud I send my sis go sch,btohqsg

I rmb writing my compo in traditional Chinese in sec,btohqsg
No more chinese unless u decide to go die in jc,btohqsg
she rn under alot of pressure by alot ppl,btohqsg
It pains me when I see people can go home earlier than me,btohqsg
or when they dont need to go to school,btohqsg
Then these bastards rub it in ur face by actually staying in sch and studying until 9pm,btohqsg
its ok while u hv dec hols the poly kids have projects and tests,btohqsg
U guys got January and February off thou haha,btohqsg
march and half of april too,btohqsg

There‚Äôs reading time in poly exams???,btohqsg
ok that was for my common test,btohqsg
dont come late ah reading time is a godsend,btohqsg
My friend from NP engineering got busted today,btohqsg
What is reading time?I'm sorry  this not happens in RP and my course   so Idk about this,btohqsg
Because he got confused about reading time and began doing the paper during reading timr,btohqsg
Wait Ur not allowed to do?,btohqsg
my ct they told us v clearly cant write only can read,btohqsg
Does uni have them too üëÄ,btohqsg
if not its just the paper time,btohqsg
literally time before the exam for u to 'read' aka look through the paper,btohqsg
SP changed reading time to writing time for this exam,btohqsg
its the best for open ended papers bc u hv time to plan what to write,btohqsg
so technically a longer paper la,btohqsg
"their reasoning is ""to reduce stress for the students""",btohqsg
yea its just 2h10min papers now,btohqsg
thats y i said a godsend,btohqsg
If yours have reading time  better make use of your time,btohqsg
i had it during my time,btohqsg
i mean  i studied a lot in camp,btohqsg
i whacked practice paper like crazy,btohqsg
every revision paper i had i would do like 3-4 times,btohqsg
I‚Äôve already done all my papers like 3-4 times LOL,btohqsg
the materials they issue suck honestly,btohqsg
idk maybe because this sem all my modules are engineeringso its just the same just do the questions directly,btohqsg
So in total about 7 papers,btohqsg
I wish mine had the reading time sia :(,btohqsg
And the papers have like grammatical errors everywhere,btohqsg
So the questions make no sense sometimes,btohqsg
acf the math values got error knn,btohqsg

so if u lose ur thoughts thats on u,btohqsg
ya the english nazi in me cant take it,btohqsg
If it's not the subject u do best in idt u shd retake,btohqsg
hmm that's true. i'm pretty average in most of my subjects,btohqsg
did that with my ex's texts üôÉüôÉ will do it again ü•∞ü•∞,btohqsg
if i set a realistic goal of all b3 for my elr2b2 and I use this as part of it  I'll probably get 16 points?,btohqsg
i can do that for anyone,btohqsg
it's possible but my low self-esteem says I can't do it,btohqsg
dO IT DO IT DK IT,btohqsg
I SEND U MY FUTURE BF TEXT WHEN WE FIGHT U GO MARK,btohqsg
