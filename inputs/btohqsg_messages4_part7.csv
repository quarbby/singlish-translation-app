Then again  it's never 'cannot sell'  more like 'cannot meet your desired price'.,btohqsg
If you lelong it I'm sure there will be a long Q to buy.,btohqsg
I'm not joking or being sarcastic because my parents will be in this situation very soon  i.e. take over new HDB and need to sell the existing HDB.,btohqsg
By right any HDB can sell one  unless it is in this kind of state when being marketed:https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/my-mother-doesnt-think-she-has-a-problem-the-challenges-faced-by-those-helping-people-who,btohqsg

Hi  just wondering is there a chat group for urbanville@woodlands house owners?,btohqsg
Anyone here knows if there's a group chat for woodlands glade owners?,btohqsg
Why so many of you keep on asking such question,btohqsg
Does anyone knows what's the current application status of alkaff breeze,btohqsg
I think no one has been informed of their appt date,btohqsg
"I've tried to search and no avail  I thought it may be because the name of the group might be different to ""Woodlands Glade"" that's why I couldn't find it. You get what I mean?",btohqsg
Maybe because the owner has set it to private mode  means only inviting,btohqsg
That's why we can't find it,btohqsg
Ahhhhh that's really sad. Thought the owner could see my texts but alas. Thats okay though üòÇ,btohqsg
How to search for the owner?,btohqsg

This Sengkang BTO made more profit than The Pinnacle @ Duxton -99.cohttps://www.99.co/singapore/insider/bto-project-the-pinnacle-duxton/,btohqsg
I actually live diagonal opposite from this aspella bto,btohqsg
Can yours be sold as high as 600k for 4r?,btohqsg
I live aspella and has sold the unit in 2019,btohqsg
Don't understand why the profit margin so huge,btohqsg
Despite its a non mature estate,btohqsg
Hello guys!Anyone can advise on this:I already gotten a unitAlready paid 2k option feeCurrent on hdb loanWaiting for appointment to pay 1st 5% downpaymentThen by right upon collecting key  I‚Äôll pay the other 5% based on staggered downpayment.If i want to change to bank loan  when should I notify hdb ?,btohqsg
Maybe you should just approach the bank and check with them,btohqsg
At the same time comparing the rates,btohqsg
Maybe just check with the hdb officer when signing lease.,btohqsg
That's what I plan to do haha,btohqsg
Afraid it's too late to switch once you have paid the option fee,btohqsg
First-timers typically go for an HDB loan since they require no cash downpayment (see below)  but if you‚Äôre savvy and have enough savings  you can opt for a bank loan to get lower interest rates.Either way  you‚Äôll need to get some kind of loan approval in principal BEFORE you chope the flat.,btohqsg
From what I know  most people who intend to get bank loan opt for hdb loan first due to lower downpayment required  and do the switching closer to key collection or even after key collection.,btohqsg
Have to service 6 months of HDB loan first before the switch,btohqsg
Then once you switched  you can't get HDB loan anymore,btohqsg
Is it? Then those who hit hdb loan limit upon the final HLE how,btohqsg
Seriously I don't know about bank loan,btohqsg
Have heard of people mentioning it,btohqsg
OK after reading your question a few times ,btohqsg
You have to come up with cash portion,btohqsg
Ya probably need to pay 5% downpayment by cash when switching to bank loan,btohqsg
Haha I'm at the stage of key collection already,btohqsg
Hmm not really  Regardless BTO or not  which project can siam one?,btohqsg
