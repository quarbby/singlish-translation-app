Diversified your headYou know what they invested?How to sustain to pay trust manager 2~2.5% every year?,btohqsg
"Estate is ""all the money and property owned by a particular person  especially at death""",btohqsg
Since when we need to pay the fund manager 2 to 2.5 percent every year ? Did you get wrong idea Bo ?,btohqsg
It is absorbed into the fund price,btohqsg
I never pay anything ? I only pay 1 time commission 1.5 percent only .. and I hold for 6 year Liao .. every months day good dividend .. and capital gain .. with right entry price,btohqsg
I bought through a financial planner using don't know what platform  so still got platform charges and his admin charges  he told me,btohqsg

There is  but is absorbed into the fund prices. As your fund is performing well  you still have profit after less out the management fee,btohqsg
Pay fund manager is a yes .. but so far my mother and I hold the unit trust more than 6 year Liao .. every Month take 5 to 6 percent dividend .,btohqsg
Should be a percentage of the investment amount,btohqsg

The banker can adjust the comm rate. So for big amount  they charge lesser,btohqsg
