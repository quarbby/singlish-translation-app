Thanks! I guess not too much  around 40k something,btohqsg
NUS accept payment via amex... I have friends who need to pay NUS haha,btohqsg
Payment on behalf ofis not Taxable (seek Professional Advice),btohqsg
"Thanks! Worried about violating UOB terms also  since they say ""The Card shall only be used for your own legitimate and genuine personal expenses and shall notbe used for commercial or other non-personal expenses.""",btohqsg
Hey anyone used Airbnb recently? Just want to check if FCY fees will be incurred if I book a stay in foreign countries but pay in SGD,btohqsg
40k not much üòÇ. One transaction 40k.,btohqsg
Sad story I even don't have 40k credit limit hahaha,btohqsg
Break into multiple transactions  pay back and then do another one haha,btohqsg
There is 1% fee if you view and pay in SGD.View and pay in host currency to avoid the 1% fee,btohqsg
Anyone having issue with paying 3x10SGD transaction with Revolut for NTUC voucher and didn‚Äôt get referral rewards?,btohqsg
Mine works  need to wait 1-2 business day to process. So long as the 3 purchase is done before the campaigns  they will still award after the event ends.,btohqsg
Also you can wait for better events like $100 per referral  referring $60 abit waste haha imo,btohqsg
The 1% fee is charged by the bank  right? So to avoid this fee  I should pay with AMAZE card? Or if it's charged by Airbnb itself  then I have to switch to host region and pay in host currency,btohqsg
Hi all  today Aug‚Äôs SSBs will be issued. As it‚Äôs my first time  any idea what can I expect and what‚Äôre any next steps? Thanks!,btohqsg
They will email u  and also reflected in your bank account.,btohqsg
Hi all. Can check using Amex true cashback to top up to gpmc still works right for the cashback  just sign up for that card last week.,btohqsg
Do you get Grab points if you use grab Mastercard to pay income tax via the AXS app?,btohqsg
Transaction needs to be posted by merchant,btohqsg

Yes. Maybe that works. I read online that Airbnb do charge up to 3%  although it was not reflected on the invoice.The extra fees comes after. So Amaze card might solve the extra 1% fee.,btohqsg
I guess we read the same article..but I just checked yesterday  for a random stay  the price is SGD is exactly at the Google rate without that 3% surcharge,btohqsg
So it seems that best solution is to use AMAZE + Citi Cashback Plus / UOB Lady's card,btohqsg
*this is just my conclusion  I might be wrong,btohqsg
Seems touch and go top up MCC is 4784  anyone tried to stack this with Citi Rewards+Amaze?,btohqsg
Hi  for citibank CC sign up bonus  does grabpay topup count as qualifying spend? Understand that i wont get cashback for it  but wondering if it counts towards the sign up bonus spending.,btohqsg
maybe you can check the T&C for the promo you're in,btohqsg
Sure? I dont recall its this mcc,btohqsg
I am surprised because Revolut metal actually give 1% cash back for topping up TnG,btohqsg
Sep SSB is announced! Slightly lower 2.8% average return than Aug‚Äôs but I feel it‚Äôs a good strategy for emergency funds.,btohqsg
Rather than the lousy bank returns,btohqsg
Wa u sub to the metal card uh?I thought there's no exclusions for cashback on the 1% if metal,btohqsg
The cashback is cap at the monthly fee. Don't see the benefit to subscribe,btohqsg
They say some exclusion in TnC. Just try lah can get full refund if don‚Äôt order card and unsubscribe.,btohqsg
But dbs multiplier alr 3.5% ü§î,btohqsg
I unfortunately can‚Äôt meet all the criteria to hit that amount :),btohqsg
Just wondering if it‚Äôs worth it to buy insurance + investment from them (as I alr have dbs cc),btohqsg
Investment need to hit $1K monthly to fulfill that criteria,btohqsg
I see‚Ä¶ maybe I should consider to put stashaway money to dbs robo invest ü§î,btohqsg

Just a quick question do you guys cash out of those broker app after taking advantage of the free gift ?,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt as I still trade with them,btohqsg
Interesting I thought everyone will cash out after the event  for me I cash out cause I want to consolidate my portfolio in IBKR,btohqsg
Otherwise I‚Äôll have moomoo  tiger  and webull + ibkr,btohqsg
I still keep the app for real time stock price monitoring tho,btohqsg
Same  I am thinking of cashing out because how new these broker are. I scare that once those crypto app start to collapse the broker app might be next.,btohqsg
Plus got too much account open,btohqsg
