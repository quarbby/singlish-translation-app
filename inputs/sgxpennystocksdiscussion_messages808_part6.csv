Honestly even in China  Merc  BMW and Audi spare parts will be more affordable than Jaguar,btohqsg
Jaguar is not popular in China  hence part prices will be higher too even though cheaper than SG,btohqsg
See if can get this next week,btohqsg
Have lah. Parts same as rover,btohqsg
Range Rover is fairly popular here. If same parts then you lucky,btohqsg
Past I get Audi and Skoda parts from china also. Skoda uses same part as VW,btohqsg
Jaguar also uses part similar to BMW and Peugeot,btohqsg
I wanted to get RS last time from Skoda. That time VW haven't take back agent,btohqsg
Anyway the fact remains Jaguar not popular here. I rarely see them. Considered buying one at a point but my old repair shop advised me against it.,btohqsg
drove Skoda Octavia from day 1 to scarp,btohqsg
Same spare parts as VW. So part are cheaper than Jap car if you know how to find,btohqsg
I never driven Octavia before... cannot comment,btohqsg
but SKoda is top 3 of my favorite list,btohqsg
I drove for 10 years till scrap. That time same VW Bora cheaper by S$26k. Same engine,btohqsg
Audi parts also can get from china,btohqsg
Smart fortwo is my favorite... before it was destroyed by Mercedes-Benz...,btohqsg
Very cheap parts for Audi as china product Audi cars,btohqsg

Audi A6 is like the standard car here in Beijing for anyone middle class trying to look important at one point,btohqsg
This car they change car dealer for the last 6 months. Can't sell,btohqsg
Because A6 was once the gov official car,btohqsg
Rolls Royce r taxis in Dubai,btohqsg
I bought the brake light and ship in from china and replace myself,btohqsg
Very simple to replace with correct tools,btohqsg
I only got one main complaint about Audi. Their A4 A6 A8 are so similar looking most people can't tell them apart if can't see badge or length difference clearly unless you own one and are familiar.,btohqsg
I drive Skoda Kadaiq SUV..nos. 1 🏆 popular past 3-5years in Taiwan,btohqsg
Anyway car are just for transport. I don't care even it's scratch or knock. I'm not car slave,btohqsg
