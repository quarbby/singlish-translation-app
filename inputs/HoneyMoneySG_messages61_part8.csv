Anyone faced failed remittance with Instarem to Korea after waiting for a few days? Ridiculous “Instant” remittance,btohqsg
What’s alternative for DBS (poor exchange rate) and Instarem (not reliable) to send money to Korea?,btohqsg
If you have $100k n would like to earn high interest 5%  Can find out uob Evol or uob One paired with uob one saving account.,btohqsg
I have a UOB one account. Might consider UOB one CC since UOB Evol needs to keep track of what you spend on while UOB One can just spend on anything and earn interest,btohqsg
Read the TnC before applying. Wish you good luck in earning high interest.,btohqsg

Hi all  if I have $70 cashback in my Citi Cashback card. In order to meet the min. spending this mth  should I spend $800 or $870? Many thanks!,btohqsg
$800. It counts spending only. Also better spend either $875 or $1000 to get $70 or $80 cashback (in multiples of $10 only),btohqsg
5 Fast transfers out and a transfer in of 5k. Also a lot of GIRO deductions,btohqsg
1). I presume you transfer in/out to/from other bank but not another of your HSBC account under your name  right?2). The GIRO transactions are completed after your 5 out and 5k in?3). The GIRO are those that you submitted hardcopy GIRO form for bill payment n not those self initiated GIRO.4). Those transactions are not in exclusion list. Correct?,btohqsg

Hi Community  can I just clarify if the  20 000 miles sign up bonus for HSBC TravelOne card is only applicable for new or both new and existing cardholders? Since they didn’t specifically specify in their T&C so thought of checking.,btohqsg
Hi everyone I’m thinking of going for the Citibank premiermiles card as miles collected never expire and welcome bonus of upto 30 000miles. Anyone has any other recommendations?,btohqsg
There’s the uob privimiles for 50 k miles welcome bonus-1k spend for 2 months- pay annual feeBut I’m not clear if the cc can stack with Kris+ or ShopBack,btohqsg
Thank you for the information. Will check it out as well :),btohqsg
I just applied for it but I’m not clear if spending on travel merchants through kris+ payment counts towards the 1k spend for 2 months   so hoping someone here is able to help clarify,btohqsg
Just wondering how would they identify me? Through my number only?,btohqsg
I'm wondering also  from the website it just click and redirect me to whatsapp for registration,btohqsg

Anyone heard of theEnjoy 22% cashback with any DBS/POSB Cardpromotion?,btohqsg
Ocbc a bit screw-up..  got 1 issue tell me not successful then 1 day ltr say I got full allocation,btohqsg
then it could just be SMS system issue la...if non competitive.. should be full allocation this round,btohqsg
seems over subscribe...total applied is 11billion,btohqsg
hi i just came out of the army and just started working  is there any recommendations for bank accounts and credit card?,btohqsg
Yours is non competitive bid  by right you should get full allocation,btohqsg
i see only 1.6 b allocated to non competitive..,btohqsg
ok there is something i HEARD BEFORE... not confirmed so take with pinch of salt.IF a bank collects too much non competitive orders  not all customers will get allocation.This is because there is actually a limit for non competitive orders that can be submitted / allocated.,btohqsg
How much money u invest to get the daily interest of +0.28 ?,btohqsg
