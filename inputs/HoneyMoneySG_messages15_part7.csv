I'm looking at going into JB for very impromptu 1D1N trip  leaving SG on friday or sat after 9.30pm kind. I wonder what kind of transport and accommodation would you guys recommend.,btohqsg
Impromptu means Train is out. Can try 2nd link via Causeway link bus  board at Jurong East MRT  alight Bukit Indah. Woodlands side is cazy on weekends,btohqsg
I know  will work this out when resources allow. The problem is HDB BTO release dates are not pre-planned and very difficult to allocate time to push video out on same day,btohqsg
1) Open a brokerage that allows SGX trading. e.g. IBSG  moomoo  Tiger  uSMART2) Buy your favourite dividend stocks,btohqsg
Look at AMEX cards like Truecashback 1.5% CB  UOB Absolute 1.7% CB or even the Highflyer card 1.8 mpd,btohqsg

thanks for this! didn't think of going via 2nd link.,btohqsg
actually does it make sense to even take bus to the woodland train checkpoint or even the marsiling HDB nearby then walk over. Or is the journey from woodlands custom to JB custom is crazy?,btohqsg
It's crazy to even think of walking from woodlands customs to jb customs.. though there's an existing walkway on the causeway,btohqsg
U can check cardup website for the two cards they have calculated maximum cashback for  but from what I saw the maximum cashback is when u pay 1k because of the fee  so u may have to split the payments,btohqsg
sorry  what i meant was walk from the marsiling HDB to woodlands checkpoint. from custom to custom take the normal bus.,btohqsg
Yes  some prefer to take bus from woodlands mrt to woodlands train checkpoint,btohqsg
Not crazy I did it before long long long ago,btohqsg
Tie to which app? I believe can just add to apple pay or samsung pay and should be able to tap at gantry.,btohqsg
I am not verse with huawei so i cant help. You can tap the physical card as well.,btohqsg
If your hauwei can add Google pay u can try,btohqsg
Not sure if the NFC wiol work,btohqsg
Can I confirm for citi rewards card  in order to convert to miles  would need to pay?,btohqsg
If u in SG won't advice u get a hauwei as may not works due to no more gms support,btohqsg
Yes I believe a fee of $25 will be applied,btohqsg
within 30mins u can clear.... if we are back to days where the bus Q itself is 1-2h  it is worth it.,btohqsg
Yes  Please review. and let us know if it is worth it to pay to ACRA every year to renew your business just to continue to use the card.,btohqsg
