What will happen if everyone pulls out of GXS bank?,btohqsg
Oops lol  so just deposit right? No need to purchase or trade anything,btohqsg
Checking out now  might as well put at poems for now,btohqsg
They can only accept 100m deposit. Their paid up capital is 1.5B,btohqsg
Gg bois 2.68%... back to ocbc 360,btohqsg
Gxs make me jin Bo eng,btohqsg
The one who suggested improvement to the main saving acct interest rate have not think hard before suggesting...outplayed by gxs bank,btohqsg
Anyway the rate cut is expected to come  sooner or later,btohqsg
"say only right...a lot of times when airlines announce devaluation or banks announce nerf they always say ""WE HEARD YOU!!""",btohqsg
Agree...as long as a few customers feedback then they have heard us,btohqsg
it changes the onus mah...from a nerf becomes a customer feedback response. Not that it makes people who know any happier. in fact it makes them more dulan,btohqsg
"I would've rather GXS use the ""due to changing macroeconomic conditions"" line than ""we heard you!""",btohqsg
most ppl here only chiong the interest rate less than a month ago. prev capped at $5k mah,btohqsg
literally nobody asked for these changes,btohqsg
The ones who don't have gxs accounts did maybe xD,btohqsg
Emptied up my gxs just now  moved to poems,btohqsg
can empty all? thought paynow max cap at 15k?,btohqsg
Everyone Chiong then now GXS chu pattern~,btohqsg
can increase...must go settings and ownself key in the new limit...I also thought the cap is 15k until I realized that I can manually key in the limit,btohqsg
I just called cimb on the 3.5% promotion.. but I'm confused by what they say.1. Incremental balance is as compared to 31 July balance2. I need to opt in via qr code3. When I deposit money in. I cannot take out anything. If I take out anything. I will not be able to enjoy promo interest.4. If I deposit 10k this month. Next month must be equals or more than 10k. If not I cannot enjoy interest.Mine is an existing starsaver account.. do you all think it's weird or the customer service officer is wrong?,btohqsg
Customer service is wrong...refer to the following link for the real T&Cs:https://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/promotions/latest-promotions/accounts/casa-sep22-promo.html#Existing%20Customers%20,btohqsg
The 4th point applies to new customersNot existing customers,btohqsg
If u have shopee account u are probably invited automatically,btohqsg
Couldnt agree more. I am happy with the rate and saving to pockets.,btohqsg
Basically you only get the 1.5% in sept if your august balance is 10k but Sept balance is 9.5k if you're new to bank,btohqsg
My eye is a bit blur now. What I read n see is ‚ÄúWE HURT YOU‚Äù.üòÇ,btohqsg
Looks like cimb is the next best place to move the funds even for existing customer,btohqsg
FYI Starsaver is a current account  $5k needed,btohqsg
exisiting customer is base on july balance if zero means any amt in deposit will get 3.5% pa for 6 mths,btohqsg
Say I open account with cimb on 17 Aug and transfer money in. I will be getting pro rated interest of 3.5% on the 1st Sept?,btohqsg
In the first place  3.5% is a per annum rate. You need to divide by 365 = 0.00959% per day. Then multiplied by however many days you're putting into your account.,btohqsg
Starsaver can be a savings account too ..,btohqsg
Guys  re: credit card annual fee waiver.. should request thru digibot or call directly?,btohqsg
I think i only got $100 in there for 5yrs alrdy lol,btohqsg

This is so Grab. Changing terms and conditions anytime,btohqsg
used to be good but surpassed by UOB One and OCBC 360,btohqsg
"should be can take out leh  their website already say ""NO lock-in period  which means you can transact anytime!""",btohqsg
