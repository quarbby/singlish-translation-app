Guys  coming from Honda Civic and looking to change to Kia Niro / ByD M6. Any thoughts ? Or should I consider Cat B cars as well?,btohqsg
Civic type R? You need to upgrade to BMW M6 not BYD m6 😳,btohqsg
Wah didn't know will Kenna 🔥,btohqsg
Left 2 years. Feels about right,btohqsg
Bro how to answer u .. depend on your budget  aspirations  needs,btohqsg
Given a choice - ByD M6  Kia Niro or just shop Cat B? Of course price is a weighing factor,btohqsg
U give up on civic alr?,btohqsg
You feel that the 20000 extra COEs will not bring down prices hence biting the bullet now? Why not wait for next bid exercise on 19/2 and see how? I wouldn’t buy an EV unless you are into changing your lifestyle to suit the car charging patterns…,btohqsg
😜buy 2 will solve some problems,btohqsg
Lol and will add 1 super big one,btohqsg
So likely COE will down ?,btohqsg
After all the car shows  barring any unknown PHV companies bidding  probability should be lower,btohqsg
So it is a good time to buy car whether new or used?,btohqsg
As usual  work out your sums for your car (depreciating asset) and should be fine. Differentiate between a need or a want  your life stage and earning/expense capacity.,btohqsg
Singapore is still the most expensive in the world to own a car 😅,btohqsg

Anyone here considering the new “facelifted” A3 ? Seems like there’s little to no coverage. Because Cat A ? 😂,btohqsg
I just saw Atto 3  2024 made. Yearly depre around 14.5kPeople said is right  just slightly more than 1 year old EV  depre dropped so much.,btohqsg
Isn't new atto3 depreciation also around the same? I am looking at TESLA used market and I can't see as much EV depreciation in Singapore as overseas.,btohqsg

Hi all Are there still 2nd hand dealers out there who don’t charge a surcharge when buying their car off in full cash ?If not  what is the usual charges ? 1-2% extra on top of their listed selling price ?Thanks,btohqsg
If u risk taker  tell them u no need lemon law,btohqsg
No dealers like full cash 🤭🤭 they make money from loans,btohqsg
The surcharge is to cover their loss,btohqsg
Usually 1 or 2k more? Depends on how much they lose from the loan,btohqsg
3 years ago  I bought from this dealer in Carros without any surcharge for full cash payment  now my car going to scrap soon. Hence  looking around 😗,btohqsg
