Thats the closest emoji to laughing haha,btohqsg
A picture of me with my car,btohqsg
Apparently I‚Äôm not good looking enough,btohqsg
That‚Äôs totally uncalled for to delete that image.,btohqsg
Why? Simply because of Carousell that is a competitor? It‚Äôs so petty.,btohqsg
I feel admin should not act this way. Displaying a card does not in anyway destroy you,btohqsg
It does not destroy us but it's a subtle reminder of our competitor to everyone in the community who scrolls through the messages.Its similar to how we don't allow ads,btohqsg
It's not that we're petty. It's just the standard protocol,btohqsg
Every chatroom Has their own t&c..No doubt this is a public space  but there shld be certain level of control and permitted content by the admins/owner. Im cool abt this hahaüëç,btohqsg
That‚Äôs not advertisement. He‚Äôs only displaying a card he got,btohqsg
I feel this is a echo chamber that you only like to hear what you want you hear.,btohqsg
You continue to do that then nobody dares say anything and you won‚Äôt improve,btohqsg
He did not advertise at all,btohqsg
There are much worst chats ard.U cant talk any thing that is not sponsored by their partners.Ws  brands  product  anything.,btohqsg
I mean  admin allows us the give feedback no matter how aggressive we are,btohqsg
ü§≠ü§≠ sounds like $60 club to me,btohqsg
Hahaha u know i know ah,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not asking you to compare with those worst off.,btohqsg
You have to put yourself in their perspective,btohqsg
If you want to go top level let people have some freedom. He didn‚Äôt display ads from Carousell,btohqsg
Chill bro Admin has the rights to remove anything they deem in inappropriate,btohqsg

Admin is the rights to do anything. Yes. But he may not know that doing so is uncalled for,btohqsg
