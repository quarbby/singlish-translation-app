Objectively? You don't it's up to the person how they weight the data,btohqsg
Only good reason I can think of is want to switch to new subject combi without retaining in MI,btohqsg
mindsets cant be changed through counselling is what i truly believe..ive said it here countless times  there have to be trauma for mindsets to change  counselling does not provide that,btohqsg
That's why u should just go to Poly and do Alevel privately,btohqsg
that's what all the former yi ppl did,btohqsg
shittalk de silva till there's no tmr,btohqsg

U laugh at me but if it works it works,btohqsg
idk if you caught it  but if you dont so be it,btohqsg
i mean if it works it works yes... but that's quite convoluted i really dk why u wld do that,btohqsg
What JCs do they transfer to though?,btohqsg
Bro u sure u aren't studying Yappology as a subject? U could get A for that,btohqsg
the general idea is counselling will never fix the problem..will just prolong the occurence of it from happening,btohqsg
sje alr mad enuf that innot in ri,btohqsg
MI to JPJC only a slight upgrade imo,btohqsg
she going to kick me out bro,btohqsg
i still rmb my RI friend begging me for my maths notes,btohqsg
Unfortunately I think as long as they in MI/JC can’t retake any o levels subject as a private candidate,btohqsg
I won't speak at all about why but errr hypothetically might be because they don't meet the COP for MI/JC,btohqsg
dw my parents are racist..fun living with them..haiz,btohqsg
So can’t improve their score and hope to get into a better score jc,btohqsg
uk what my mom ssys abt ite poly jc students,btohqsg
personally i think they shld just focus on poly then,btohqsg
Like you can’t see for any GCE subjects as a private candidate if you’re in jc/mi,btohqsg
ri hc all the smart prc chinese n indians then ite all the dumb malays go there,btohqsg
if cannot settle o level still want to do poly + a level,btohqsg
Hypothetically ah. What if they cannot get good gpa for poly.,btohqsg
But then when retaking the o level subject it’s not as a private candidate,btohqsg
I’m saying that they get to choose what o level subjects to retake while in MI,btohqsg
This one is they forced to take,btohqsg
