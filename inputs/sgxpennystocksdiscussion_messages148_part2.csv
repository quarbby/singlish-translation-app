Jiutian Chemical Group (JIUC SP)3Q20: Earnings Overshoot Expectations; DMF ASP Higher Than Expected3Q20 net profit of Rmb51.9m (+2 038% yoy  +59% qoq) overshot our estimate ofRmb38.8m  due mainly to higher-than-expected DMF ASP. While spot DMF prices areseeing some softening since our stock initiation  they are expected to stay elevated dueto sustainable demand. We lift our 2021F DMF ASP assumption slightly by 2.9% toRmb7 200/tonne  keeping a healthy buffer of 30% below the current spot price ofRmb9 350/tonne. Maintain BUY with higher target price of S$0.18.,btohqsg

‚Ä¢ 3Q20 record earnings overshoot estimate. Jiutian Chemical Group (Jiutian) reported anew quarterly record net profit of Rmb51.9m in 3Q20 (+2 038% yoy  +59% qoq)  lifted byhigher ASP for fine chemical dimethylformamide (DMF) to Rmb6 195/tonne. This brings9M20 net profit to Rmb87.5m (9M19: Rmb10.8m loss)  or 41% of our new 2020 estimate.‚Ä¢ Revenue gained 8.8% yoy to Rmb267.0m. On the back of higher DMF ASP ofRmb6 195/tonne (+36.4% yoy  +37.3% qoq)  3Q20 revenue rose to Rmb267.0m (+8.8%yoy) but slipped 3.4% qoq due to a lower utilisation rate of 44% (3Q19: 49%  2Q20: 56%)for Anyang Jiutian DMF plant arising from the scheduled maintenance shutdown of 20days in Sep 20.‚Ä¢ Benefitted from greater operating leverage. 3Q20 gross margin expanded to 31.4%(3Q19: 7.7%  2Q20: 19.4%) on: a) higher product prices; and b) lower cost for methanol a major raw material for DMF  due to depressed crude oil prices. This translated intopositive operating leverage for Jiutian  which recorded a spike in net margin to 19.5%(3Q19: negative; 2Q20: +11.8%).‚Ä¢ Spot DMF prices softening but elevated prices sustainable. While spot prices forDMF have softened to Rmb9 350/ton as at 11 Nov 20  it remains 34% above our initialestimate of Rmb7 000/ton for 2021. Management cited the surge in demand for DMF wasdriven by strong growth in the local and export markets for its end-products  as well asrising demand from users in the lithium batteries and semiconductor sectors in China.,btohqsg
