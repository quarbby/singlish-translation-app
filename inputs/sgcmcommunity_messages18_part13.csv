with a thicker sway bars  better on track.,btohqsg
however  the car still understeered. front is still heavy. this problem is finally solved with giulia.,btohqsg
so front drive cars i thin honda  megane do much much better than alfa. alfa the front overhang is too long. look at 159. the front is so long,btohqsg
156 is a GT car  not so much for track use,btohqsg
"IMO  the giulia veloce is a ""complete"" car. stylish  good interior  good power  good handling  good looks  good performance and can use on track too and daily",btohqsg
if veloce drops to 100K it is compelling to buy. because i know when i have this i wont change.,btohqsg
that's y it looks good till now.ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
i akso had the 156 JTS. haha this one you'd better not buy. this is the first Alfa GDI engine car  not dont well. the engine burns oil. and every 3 weeks or so got to add oil otherwise the engine can stave oil and not careful will destroy engine,btohqsg
if i strike 8m toto maybe,btohqsg
aiya not expensive la the car,btohqsg
