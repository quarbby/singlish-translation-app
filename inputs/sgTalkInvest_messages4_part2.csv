Here’s the deal. We are a group of companies. Our name is Bespoke Capital Group. As of right now  we are hiring.As long as you’re 21 and above (for guys  completed ns) and have these : either a diploma or an A-level certificate.Its hard to encapsulate what the jobscope is. That is why there is a briefing  scheduled at your convenience for you to come in and we’ll explain everything to you. But as of right now  a good way of putting it is being a financial advisor. But that is just the tip of the iceberg.This job is purely at your own time and target. If you’re not so confident now  you can juggle this job on top of your full time job. Of course there will be mandatory training provided prior to all these.Down to the numbers. Lets say you get one client. MINIMALLY  you will be earning 1.5k for just that one client. On average  a newbie gets around 10 clients a month (we will teach you how). Thats 15k a month. For a newbie. And mind you  1.5k is the minimal. The best case scenario to date was 14k from just one client. 14 bloody thousand. I’m not hard selling this. Whatever i say is genuinely true. Come down and have a look for yourself.Whatsapp or telegram me  Hakim +6596712334if you have any queries or you wanna set up the briefing time and date.,btohqsg
