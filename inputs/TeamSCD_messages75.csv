Singapore wan get HDB room oso Bo at that price,btohqsg
Means my rent from a hdb room  I can rent a condo in jb,btohqsg
U rent out whole HDB..can buy bungalow in JB liao,btohqsg
Now then u realised ar sir Gerald?😂,btohqsg
Now 5 rooms HDB whole unit can rent out 3k plus easily,btohqsg
Before that over 10 years never go,btohqsg
Never like to go in JB area😂,btohqsg
But then again I don't really have friends in Malaysia,btohqsg
So no reason to have house there,btohqsg
Only reason I can think off is to store track car one day 😂,btohqsg
Used to stay KL for years,btohqsg
But I always scared I walk back to the car  I missing some wheels,btohqsg
Rub the correct shoulders....easy to make it good there😁,btohqsg
Still waiting for u to break my arms,btohqsg
You busy enough for the day,btohqsg
See when lor... Now difficult  my projects all at night,btohqsg
I work same timing like you,btohqsg
Last time morning go at night come back. Really Siao on wan,btohqsg
Used to have a blast running with the local boys,btohqsg
Must sit your race car leh,btohqsg
Ya I can’t type muchThere really like watch Jacky Chan movieRounding is hundreds offCars,btohqsg
Lolx...now is a pale shadow of it former self😂,btohqsg
Can always bring it back to it's glory days,btohqsg
Way back in 2015...hahaha....that is something to be admired..now...it is just a point a to b,btohqsg
Unless you had a k24 inside.. then that one a bit hard,btohqsg
This I have... But car body as heavy as me,btohqsg
K24 too heavy for such a small body...the car bias going be crap even with cornerweight balancing,btohqsg
It is not just abt bhp and torque....it is abt how everything balanced out in a car😁,btohqsg
Fast car but slow driver sadly,btohqsg
This one is quite subjective too😂😂😂,btohqsg
Every car got its own set of pros n cons😂,btohqsg
No such thing as a perfect car😂,btohqsg
It is up to the driver to max the pros n minimise the cons😂,btohqsg
Also too many eyes on the road,btohqsg
In Singapore..best not to la sir,btohqsg
So many car cams...so many cams on lamp posts,btohqsg
Best place to improve skills n test machine😂,btohqsg
Can get to know many fellow trackies too,btohqsg
But when think of track  you end up not wanting to destroy the ride,btohqsg
That's how I had the idea of getting a wira,btohqsg
Yes but rebuilt an affordable one,btohqsg
Erm....try getting a track car is okie but it burn more money,btohqsg
Unless u r really gonna be a regular appearance on tracks....,btohqsg
Or else the 2 times one year thing not gonna be very cost effective in terms of procuring a sole track usage only car,btohqsg
I think find a ws that have it own track team help in terms of lowering the running costs,btohqsg
ST powered...SK garage..Uber garage n so on,btohqsg
Didn't hear nice things Abt sk  and I don't like garage r,btohqsg
At least can lower the storage and parts expenses,btohqsg
I do know they dun work on all cars,btohqsg
Waiting for my cousin to build his off-road...,btohqsg
Then drive up in mine but play in his,btohqsg
All r tuned n setup to individual driver sir,btohqsg
He used to race a lot,btohqsg
Had an eg6 that is now lost,btohqsg
Nowadays very hard to see JDM ones on track😂,btohqsg
Eg6 is nice but 30yrs old liao😂,btohqsg
Honestly..me not really a advocate of street racing....,btohqsg
I drive very conservative on streets 😂,btohqsg
Waiting for the day he coaches on how to track,btohqsg
Pls jio when he is ready to impart his skills n experiences😂,btohqsg
I think I oso rusty in terms of skills😂😂😂,btohqsg
Been like a long 3yrs plus since last hit the track😂,btohqsg
Sad to see him get out of cars,btohqsg
But his merc is still a very nice one,btohqsg
Pretty sure it will outrun me any day,btohqsg
His vtec dream has been passed on to me,btohqsg
Ur euro r indeed is a beauty😁,btohqsg
My cousin used to drive one too...,btohqsg
Because you don't know what to change to,btohqsg
Used to fly along with him on nshw n genting morning mountain runs,btohqsg
Some owners end up buying back euro r,btohqsg
He oso old Liao...wan comfort over performance,btohqsg
To him is very underwhelming liao,btohqsg
Compared to our tiny na engines,btohqsg
Back then his euro r I think pushing 300plus bhp on wheels,btohqsg
I can't see his tail lights once he get into the form on nshw,btohqsg
That when I lose sight of his tail lights,btohqsg
It's a very stable car at speed,btohqsg
But he always slow down for me to catch up back then,btohqsg
Likes to cruise at Abt 110,btohqsg
Becoz he know I can't hit that speed at a constant above 180kmph for too long,btohqsg
So he slow down to wait for me to catch-up 😂,btohqsg
100 to 110 it's at a speed you give very little throttle and it just runs nicely,btohqsg
He said 150 is extremely comfortable and stable😂,btohqsg
Just a light tap of throttle😂,btohqsg
Yeah it will go 150 nicely,btohqsg
But the gearing very different with every car,btohqsg
I m deeply impressed with honda engines n tech actually,btohqsg
Must own one to uds the sheer joy of driving one,btohqsg
Is fine. Im down with fever anyways,btohqsg
Finally your turn... Actually my friend today just kena,btohqsg
But now they aiming more of JDM performance and contis,btohqsg
Last time they more frenly toward bread n butter cars😂,btohqsg
Some ws dun really entertain old jdm small hatches😂,btohqsg
Reality of life can be harsh for old small NA JDM car owners😂,btohqsg
Oic..not abt famous or not la,btohqsg
Is whether have the skills and eye for details n dedication that matter,btohqsg
I no need lube all this,btohqsg
U need. If not your k20 will feel rough,btohqsg
U see  now already got ice cream sound.,btohqsg
Next time please don come empty handed,btohqsg
Actually I don't mind ice cream if it's soft to step like Sam's,btohqsg
Ice cream car come  but no ice-cream. A bit not tally,btohqsg
Ice cream came in a van,btohqsg
Think of monday tomorrow. A bit cannot sleep,btohqsg
If only can don't do anything,btohqsg
Nite shift group all washing cars at car wash king place now I think😂,btohqsg
Lolx...the picture sent earlier on by admin ...alot of cars there,btohqsg
I work night tomorrow so trying to sleep late today,btohqsg
Thank you for the support bros !!@roincec@bubaiii@gggavviinn,btohqsg
idk bro just saw the post and share  have to contact them to ask price,btohqsg
Hahaha axle motors is one of those that started all the crazy JDM tax.,btohqsg
You can see their cars all list much higher than others  to drive prices up,btohqsg
That black euro r  I viewed almost a year ago still not sold,btohqsg
how much they list for? LOL,btohqsg
I rmb back then they got 1 white pop ups MX5 also,btohqsg
list their depre 3 to 4k higher than the market,btohqsg
Idk why people don’t buy fn2r clearly better value,btohqsg
Everything also will buy as long as it fits the budget,btohqsg
crazy sia  they list FD2R at 20k depre,btohqsg
SG got a few dealers that started this JDM tax shit,btohqsg
You can really blame them for driving prices up,btohqsg
They make my car more valuable,btohqsg
I love the hikes in JDM tax😂,btohqsg
But yeah I like the look of the fn2r,btohqsg
I almost bought 1 when choosing that or swift sport,btohqsg
It was Abt 8 to 10k when I saw it,btohqsg
back when it is 6k depre,btohqsg
Fn2r is the most worth while right now,btohqsg
I’d get it as a track car,btohqsg
The higher the prices the better😂😂😂,btohqsg
No complains abt the current craze abt jdms😂,btohqsg
We all pay the bill down the line,btohqsg
those JDM tax causing domino effect,btohqsg
My gtr can fetch 40k depre now but sell already buy,btohqsg
But it's the abandoned type r child,btohqsg
Lolx...for me not really...driving the same one for 9yrs plus and will keep to the very end😂,btohqsg
it's causing prices of used cars to go up also,btohqsg
Happy to see the prices climb steadily 😂,btohqsg
So unless you sell and forget about buying cars,btohqsg
At the end of the day you’ll end up with a ridiculously overpriced car,btohqsg
It's also the cause of COE prices to go up ma,btohqsg
COE price up you cfm affected,btohqsg
And if you’re just a budget high loan owner that cannot keep long term,btohqsg
Good luck selling in the future,btohqsg
As used car prices go up in the market  people rather buy new cars. Causing higher demand. Not to mention such JDM cars also need to renew COE.,btohqsg
No matter what  directly or indirectly  we're all affected by the market,btohqsg
That is gonna be 6 yrs later,btohqsg
Hopefully coe prices drop in 5 years,btohqsg
Currently..very happy with the situation 😂,btohqsg
My 2012 swift sport brand new was 58k depre. Back then people say it's crazy high,btohqsg
now end up masi the same,btohqsg
I regret not getting a cs3 then,btohqsg
i regret buying a parf car,btohqsg
should have gotten a coe car.,btohqsg
I hope to keep this car all the way,btohqsg
Just need to plan for an engine rebuild in the coming years,btohqsg
I wanna say the same  but will never know in the future is how,btohqsg
Yours is one of the legends leh,btohqsg
Mine is just an accord that many don't know exist,btohqsg
Lol..as long owner shiok can liao la...no need the recognition de la😂😂😂,btohqsg
Got recognition then price can go higher,btohqsg
Feel shiok when ppl say another car very nice... Then you say  but that one is cheaper then this,btohqsg
got no demand so price hard to go up,btohqsg
I like 2 seater but can't afford them,btohqsg
For now i dont have a need for a bigger car la,btohqsg
Dont think i'll ever need also,btohqsg
I am very interested in the new Z or Manual supra,btohqsg
so i don't know if next time I'll ever jump to it or not,btohqsg
Don't like the look of the new z,btohqsg
I got a fn2r for sale. 🤣,btohqsg
I love the fact it looks like all the mash ups of the old Zs,btohqsg
I like the 350 and 370,btohqsg
Same  but the engine too big to be practical in SG,btohqsg
So the lines of the new Z don't fit my taste,btohqsg
the new Z is still on the same chassis as 350 and 370,btohqsg
The real reason I'm not driving one,btohqsg
So side profile it's still the exact same,btohqsg
the new Z loses to the 3.0 supra on Hagerty,btohqsg
He did say cos the Z is on inferior tyres,btohqsg
Manual can always get the Gr86,btohqsg
If i buy a supra  it'll be the 2L in manual anyway,btohqsg
new gr86 selling liao. saw one on Driven on steelies haha,btohqsg
The only redeeming factor is  the Z is cheaper than 2L Supra overseas,btohqsg
So they keep saying toyota is quite fked,btohqsg
dk when come SG will be same or not only,btohqsg
idk why they brought it in,btohqsg
should keep the steelies. or get thicker ones.,btohqsg
Dk if have approved ones or not,btohqsg
ltr LTA pua stunt tell you GR86 RC and GR86 2 diff cars,btohqsg
your HKS cannot fit on it,btohqsg
the exhaust situation w the previous 86 and brz was quite a mess,btohqsg
That's why it's gonna be an issue also,btohqsg
making it more complicated than necessay,btohqsg
So just stay with what I have,btohqsg
The RC is just stupid la,btohqsg
It's supposed to be cheaper so people can buy and convert to track car,btohqsg
the RC only 3K cheaper than standard BRZ,btohqsg
still can one la. just wait for a Mr Moneybags to come along. SG got many,btohqsg
3K can't even buy you rims and exhausts,btohqsg
Whoever thought it's a good idea...,btohqsg
I can see that car diao there for damn long la,btohqsg
They nv do enough market research,btohqsg
just curious  your name is supposed to be sleepy senpai issit,btohqsg
