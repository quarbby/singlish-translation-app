✈️Pika World Daily Updates- 17 Nov 2021✈️🪂The Talk of 2 Giants⏰It was like a rainbow after a stormy rain. President Biden and President Xi had a robust virtual meeting during a 3-hour talk  showing signs of thawing in a relationship despite occasional strong words.President Biden is joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  reflecting the degree of the economic significance of the meeting. Not forgetting Jake Sullivan  who is the top China expert in the administration.🎙Relaxing and Calmness⌛️The conversation between the two leaders was described as cordial as they talked about their long-standing friendship. President Xi showed agreement with President Biden in climate change and encouraged more extensive discussion and cooperation.The press statement by both sides shows some level of restrains  although the US did point out concerns on human rights and the nature of trade and economic practices that seemed unfair. The Taiwan issue was on the card too as President Xi gave a strong word that should Taiwan independence be a reality  it breaks the line of tolerance and leads to China having to take draconian action.🎉A rare sign of harmonious moment🪜On the backdrop of this meeting is a sensitive spot. It is ushering some normalcy in bilateral ties that were stressful and challenging under President Trump era for both countries. However  it is also a period where China is becoming more assertive globally as its political  military and economic prowess continues to grow  which unnerve the critics of China in the US  making it harder for President Biden to go soft on China.In the spirit of striking a balance between competition and cooperation  it is heartwarming that both leaders acknowledged the need to have frequent communication to avoid any conflicts as both countries become more involved in activities around Taiwan and South China sea.Markets welcome the news as both leaders' concerted effort to ease tension despite clear hurdles that are to be overcomed that could very well shape the modern political economy of the 21st century.📮What's on the menu today?At 9.30 pm  we will have the building permits data which we expect to be at 1.638M  a rise from 1.586M in the prior period.FOMC members such as Williams and Bowman will be speaking too.It is 17 Nov  Wednesday  at 7.20 am in Singapore and 7.20 pm in New York.
