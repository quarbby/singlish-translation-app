got new generation coming that's why,btohqsg
like tesla  they're removing the fake grille and everything,btohqsg
But the car is at 270 k u compare with m3 at 500K and 3.5 k road tax   u will think it a steal,btohqsg
that's why no stock in SG  because Eurokars still waiting to bring in the new one,btohqsg
just that M3 might hold value better in the future,btohqsg
ya  for the power  worth every penny,btohqsg
What value when ice is soon gone,btohqsg
Tesla resale also keep going up   and with no ad margin   buy a m3 dealer easily earn over 100 plus k,btohqsg
U buy a new m3 now see 2025 onwards How,btohqsg
ICE staying  might be rare but still around. Tesla resale going up in sg because of delivery delays and COE being higher. I'm talking long term holding value,btohqsg
Goverment might slap with more tax,btohqsg
you see those old Model S and Model X outside  see how much value they hold,btohqsg
u try to replace all the lorry and tipper trucks with ev lor haha,btohqsg
Lol u go and see the resale market for tesla ur self,btohqsg
Eurokars expanding their building LOL more to come,btohqsg
many ppl are earning money because of COE rise,btohqsg
different car appeal to different people. but tesla price to performance ratio  i think hard to beat,btohqsg
Noon question. How does hybrid works?,btohqsg
Can I just use the battery to drive?,btohqsg
straightline performance  definitely. round the corners  i wld say tesla is not the best value for money,btohqsg
U name a 280 k can do corner better then model 3 performance,btohqsg
ya  the dealer chao chao make 20 to 50% premium,btohqsg
More then that la 100 plus % of omv,btohqsg
Giulia  Megane RS  Civic Type R  420  GR Yaris  MX5  JCW GP  GR86  Z4,btohqsg
Outside see  not sg. SG not long enough to judge. the 2012  2013 teslas dead already,btohqsg
yuppp  they need to wait for homologation,btohqsg
that can't be help  xD LTA issnt very merciful towards power,btohqsg
only one way to find outðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ,btohqsg
Type r and such is a front wheel drive,btohqsg
Everyday see their building go up now fixing Facade already lol. I think in 3-6mths all up,btohqsg
I think tesla in the right mode won;'t be too far off,btohqsg
uhhh u try gr yaris lor,btohqsg
model 3 performance can lose its tail just as easily as any rear wheel dirve,btohqsg
megane rs got 4 wheel steering M3 dh leh,btohqsg
All these are not in the league of m3p in the first place ppl are comparing with m3 and such or rs3,btohqsg
Straight line already eaten them alive,btohqsg
Hey sgcm  thanks for your filter of priced less than 300k indicating sports car as my vehicle typeðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
we were comparing round the corner...,btohqsg
Got corner got straight and awd got advantage for sure,btohqsg
HAHAHAHHAAH yeah man cant wait to see lol,btohqsg
why nobody mention WRX . king of corner,btohqsg
u try monaco street circuit lor,btohqsg
What u are saying is like those car are better then rs3,btohqsg
And said see on track lol,btohqsg
but probably at less than half the cost,btohqsg
Paper lose not counted   then said ok track,btohqsg
Dun mention last time my friend drove this his bitting point machiam high HAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
no body talks about 335 Hais,btohqsg
Yes that why I ask him what car at 280 k is better then m30,btohqsg
Then come to curve  all jam brake coz they only know how to mash throttle,btohqsg
