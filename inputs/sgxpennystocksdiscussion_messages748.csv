Today pennies run up to get out IMHO,btohqsg
alot of rights the price will reduce for 1st 3-4 days.  will enter 2nd last day and if lucky enough last day ppl push u can sell the rights. if not then subscribe for long term,btohqsg
sometime mother share price attractive no need buy rights also. can just buy mother share,btohqsg
Next year Oil will continue shoot up? Looks so strong.,btohqsg
if u oway play rights  80% pattern is like this,btohqsg
Will mother share Acrometa go as low at 20 ?,btohqsg
no ppl can tell. i can say if mother share go to that price before right issue i will buy 500 lots to keep,btohqsg

Why sgx so smelly.  Market is like this. U happy u buy. U not happy then don't buy. Why John soh is called manipulation?  We retailer lose money claim from who? If here got sgx spy  let me tell it to your face fuck u sgx.,btohqsg
John Soh  the mastermind involved in the penny stock crash has been jailed 36 years  while his co-conspirator Quah Su-Ling was handed 20 years.The pair were behind Singapore’s biggest case of stock market manipulation that wiped out nearly $8 billion in market value.https://str.sg/wyhZ,btohqsg
What happen to the $$$ he gains?  Still in the pocket,btohqsg
Yes  can investors claim back the money?,btohqsg

Not to make $ but cheat ppl $,btohqsg
Acrometa  i am quite convinced that they will have games. You can tell by the recent PA. got players inside already. today also held well on XR. got players controlling this one,btohqsg
MT sinjia yoma all these 有实力,btohqsg
I hope Acrometa will give us a good boost in Jan 2023 and let us profit and start well come Jan23,btohqsg
Hope this life time short life too. Cheaters always have long lives.,btohqsg
Just don't know abt how to do w e right 😂,btohqsg
ok jia you and good luck to us,btohqsg
Next life cannot become human  become 💩 worm,btohqsg
Confirm. But more importantly this life must be short  imagine all the investors dead Liao and the cheater still alive. 😅,btohqsg
Than cheater have last laugh 😐,btohqsg
But then sometimes u think bk  kana cheated could be past life all cheated him so he come take bk nia 😂,btohqsg
the rights you can trade on 4th to 12th Jan. it will be in your CDP by then.,btohqsg
to sell or to convert have to decide then which ever favourable to us,btohqsg
meaning to say if 4th Jan  mother share is trading at open $0.040  rights price will be around $0.020 etc.,btohqsg
So check Cdp got how many jiu throw 😂,btohqsg
we can sell the rights if we want.if they pump up mother share to $0.060 on rights day  the rights share will also go to $0.040,btohqsg
if they want people subscribe to rights  they will pump higher,btohqsg
depends on them   all i know is got players inside liao based on the PA so i believe we will get lucky on this rights play exercise,btohqsg
Any updates on the place ?,btohqsg
Rights play can take reference to biolidic play last few mths,btohqsg
This was Biolidics rights play pre-rights and during rights from my re-collection . (Correct me if I’m wrong)Do note Biolidics even had Clearbridge dumping open market and were bleeding money. (Otherwise  I believe they would have ran much further on this rights play)Acrometa on the other hand  balance sheet decent with $6mil cash on hand  recent showed turnaround profit with higher top line and at current price the market cap is just over $6 mil . Their recent EPS in FY statement is $0.0115 too.Order book growing with investment in waste to energy  co-working labs business is good potential theme plays too.DYODD as I am giving my opinion and now price wise I see value as I do not like to chase.For me i believe if have some holding power  can take some and try to get rights too as I believe it will be played  whether now or future.,btohqsg
fingers crossed that Acrometa will get pumped up good man,btohqsg
i hope in Jan 2023  i can shout here SHIOK ACROMETA! HUAT EVERYONE hahaha,btohqsg
All BBs please support. This one very good game,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 29 December 2022🎉🧸Equity market hit by bears💸Equity markets could not keep up with their gains as investors digest news from the latest loosening of China's Covid-19 restrictions in a thin trading session. The Nasdaq is the biggest loser as it had fallen by more than 10% this month  likely to be its worst December on record.It does not help that the bond yield is also climbing above 3.8% for the 10-year Treasury yield on Tuesday and remain at the elevated level on Wednesday.🎢One more chance for the market to Moon📊At 9.30 pm  we will receive the Initial Jobless Claims. It is one last piece of important data for the week that could help to spark some relief rally. Even with the widespread news of retrenchment  the labour market appeared to be resilient.The Fed is heavily focused on seeing the labour market weaken. So  we will like to see a spike in the initial jobless claims to 225K from 216K in the prior period. So bad news for the job market can become good news for the equity market.Pika Nat's IBKR portfolio is massively down(probably -50%) for the year  like many others  but we will be by your side for the remaining trading days.It is 29 December  Thursday  at 8.50 am in Singapore and 7.50 am in New York. Have a cheerful day  Pika World friends!,btohqsg

Let’s reference the upcoming Acrometa rights issue play to the most recent one that I know of  which is Biolidics.- Biolidics XR was on 9th Nov 22 and their Rights shares started trading on the 11th Nov 22.2 days prior to rights commencement of trading on 11th Nov 22  Biolidics was pumped up from $0.026 to $0.055.We are at about the same period of when Biolidics pump started  for Acrometa wise since the rights of Acrometa will be trading on 4th Jan 23.Hence  keep a close watch. The players are committed already from recent PA. I forsee a pump prior and during the rights trading to entice more subscribers for the $0.020 rights.DYODD,btohqsg

BREAKING: Soccer legend Pelé dead at 82,btohqsg
🎉Pika World Daily Review – 30 December 2022🎉🎢Equity market rose with job data📊Finally  a relief rally happened as more Americans filed for unemployment. The Initial Jobless Claims also rose to 225K  which is in line with most estimates or slightly higher. The weaker job report is good news for the Fed as it tries very hard to tame inflation. Essentially  weaker labour markets translate to lesser demand for goods.Nonetheless  gains are capped as investors further digest that the numbers are still healthy as they are very close to the pre-pandemic levels  reflecting a strong underlying strength that has not broken despite massive news.📮What’s on the menu today?📖There isn’t any significant economic data today  and we hope for a blissful end to the year of trading.It is 30 Dec  Friday  9 am in Singapore and 8 am in New York.Pika World wishes everyone a Moonatic week ahead!🗽🎲,btohqsg
