u can have no pulse for a variety of other reasons ie ventricular fibrillation (which you can shock)  pulseless electrical activity (cardiac monitor got rhythm but no pulse),btohqsg
when u have ventricular fibrillation the heart rhythm is just squiggly lines  u can imagine it as a like a computer having blue screen,btohqsg
so defillibration to the heart is essentially resetting the computer by turning it off and on again and gets the heart to be organised  which is why you are taught in CPR class to immediately resume compressions after delivering a shock with an AED/defib,btohqsg
when u have asystole u donâ€™t shock because the compyter has no more batter so even if u press the off and on switch the computer will still not turn in,btohqsg
