Bro was probably like 1 step away from recruiting you into his personal mlm scheme,btohqsg
SOI and SEG is the dumping ground ngl,btohqsg
Apparently he was stalking me for a bit,btohqsg
Idk what you mean by bias when Alot of ppl know in rp. Soi is like a whole diff school in itself,btohqsg
Tata is that type of person,btohqsg
Except the financial gurus only have 1 criminal record,btohqsg
The better schools are probably SAS and SMC,btohqsg
Eh Orpheus why you ignoring me,btohqsg
You sign NDA with Tata ah,btohqsg
Bruh 26 is damn high and they basically accept anyone basically,btohqsg
If he's stalking this channel he's probably like not smart enough to figure out what's going on anyway,btohqsg
Should be quite easy to spot,btohqsg
Why u so obsessed with Tata,btohqsg
Na Ele is just a kaypoh kid,btohqsg
yeah 26 nett r4 is horrible,btohqsg
Yeah wtf are u expecting they didn't include the course GPA average but I guarantee you it ain't good,btohqsg
if you put in some effort i guarantee you wouldnʼt be scoring straight Cs,btohqsg
and you would actually get better than that,btohqsg
unless you are really the person that can operate on hands on learning  then thats another story,btohqsg
In the past 1 week Spotify has stopped giving me ads even tho I don't have premium,btohqsg
You just downloaded the app? Same thing happened to me it was like they forgot about it lol  until aft like 2 or 3 weeks,btohqsg
isnʼt the whole of sg obsessed with japan and south korea,btohqsg
that shouldnt just be limited to a social media platform,btohqsg
I downloaded a long time ago,btohqsg
No you aren’t  it’s true  speaking from anecdotal experience,btohqsg
no? a lot of my classmates are in love with anime,btohqsg
having japanese characters as their pfps is common place here,btohqsg
whole of sgis an absolute term,btohqsg
is either that or they give u free premuium as trial,btohqsg
i heard south korea is hella sexist. not sure if thats true or not,btohqsg
No it still says free account,btohqsg
i consider it as a yes,btohqsg
both japan and south korea treat women poorly,btohqsg
no like they give u trial for premium,btohqsg
is still free acct cuz u cant download,btohqsg
look at weibo before u say this,btohqsg
to be fair the only reason i would never move to japan or south korea is because1. i dont speak their language2. south korea is near a country thats tasting nukes every year3. japan has natural disasters yearly4. COL isnt very good there. heard their COL is high,btohqsg
and overall... just not a big fan of their culture really,btohqsg
Do people want to move to Japan because they think it’s like anime? Loll,btohqsg
its funny if you want to move overseas because of that,btohqsg
rather than good job opportunities  good standard of living  easy to get a job and citizenship,btohqsg
China is good if you can carve out a specific niche where you enter a relatively well paying career and live in one of the nicer cities,btohqsg
The government regulations are kind of shit,btohqsg
But if you earn well and live in a good area it's the same as living in a first world country,btohqsg
Just don't move to rural Henan and expect to become rich,btohqsg
If Jiangsu were a country it would be considered a developed country,btohqsg
But not all of China is that rich,btohqsg
It's near to HK if you want to get out and experience western comforts,btohqsg
And there's lots of opportunities for tech ppl,btohqsg
But ofc that's if you think it's the right move,btohqsg
