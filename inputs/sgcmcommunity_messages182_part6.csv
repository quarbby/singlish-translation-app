Good morning! Looking for a smaller hatchback/suv. Trying to decide between a Kia stonic 1.0T and a Honda fit hybrid. Can share your feedback/considerations?,btohqsg
Anyone used jerga ultimea transition solar film ? Any feedback?,btohqsg
I passed inspection but I heard some people fail before,btohqsg
Effect as in the heat rejection or the transition?,btohqsg
Heat rejection is about as good as it gets for all kinds of solar film,btohqsg
Not great but happy with drive,btohqsg
Cannot . Will crash. It’s too steep,btohqsg
My timing not great.. at 3 mins 53 secs,btohqsg
Got kids? Got strollers? Got wheelchairs?,btohqsg
Golf R alr 2min 22 sec,btohqsg
2 young kids (4 and 7). Family of 4. No stroller. Storage not as important. Priority is traveling around as I clock around 60-70km on average daily. So fuel efficiency is important.,btohqsg
For hybrid wud be a better choice,btohqsg
Correction this day and age where got cheap car?,btohqsg
Corolla Cross must get frm Borneo. The PI variant is 🤢,btohqsg
Metal box with 4 wheels 😢,btohqsg
Tbh  if he list Kia Stonic n Fit Hybrid  means his budget is ard 1l n 1.3l budget liao,btohqsg
Between Stonic n Fit... Hard to choose,btohqsg
One reason i nvr get Fit is cos PI variants r all watered down specs. Most dont have steering controls. Even basic volume n call control also dont have,btohqsg
That one he brake until got sparks all .,btohqsg
Initial downpayment looking at around $30k. Monthly around 1k,btohqsg
How’s your experience driving a Stonic so far? Turbo engine?,btohqsg
75k can get vezels  wish  shuttle,btohqsg
Also considering. Go see and test drive first. Don’t know much about this model,btohqsg
You need to see how long you want to keep the car as well,btohqsg
Monthly 1k for how many months,btohqsg
Can be 1 year  can be 5 year car at this budget,btohqsg
My wife prefer smaller cars. Easier to park haha. That’s why not looking at wish and shuttle,btohqsg
Around 1k per month on the installment. Looking at owning for long term,btohqsg
WAHHHHHHHHHH 🥰🥰🥰 faster even than some Porsches and Lamborghinis.,btohqsg
How’s your experience with it so far sir?,btohqsg
Seems good leh. In general the new Kias are looking good internal and external,btohqsg
Last time instalments only 500 to 900. How far we have fallen,btohqsg
I’m on 6 pot sir. It’s not about the braking . It’s the tracks banking .,btohqsg
Not too bad. 1l turbo is fun to drive ard,btohqsg
Kinda like it tbh. Small zippy,btohqsg
Womt lose at red light at least,btohqsg
