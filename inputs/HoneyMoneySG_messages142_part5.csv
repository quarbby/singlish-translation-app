Hi everyone  I accidentally applied for the wrong card and it got approved. I intended to apply for the Citi Rewards card but mistakenly applied for the Citi PremierMiles card instead. Is it possible to cancel the card and switch to the Citi Rewards card while still being eligible for the $400 PayNow reward? Could you advise me on the steps to proceed?,btohqsg
no recourse for this. At most see if there is sign up bonus for citi premiermiles,btohqsg
Also if i apply for the CitiRewards card can i still get another $400 reward?,btohqsg
its only for new to bank?,btohqsg
Hi just wanted to check - for moomooâ€™s 6.8% p.a. Offer is our money insured?,btohqsg
The singsaver promo is for citi premier also right? Can hit the spend to get 400$ too i think,btohqsg
Yes  but Iâ€™m not too keen on keeping the Citi PremierMiles card. I was wondering if it would still work the same if I canceled it and applied for the Citi Rewards card instead.,btohqsg
Cancel the apply next year. ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
i think i'll just hit the $500 spend to get the cash reward first haha,btohqsg
Another question - for the DBS Takashimaya AMEX card  the $250 purchase amount is it cumulative or all in one receipt?,btohqsg
Ya just spend on Citi premier and get sign up bonus. Then get Citi rewards. At most you are losing only 2k miles.,btohqsg
i'm wondering since i'm an existing Citi bank customer if i apply for the citirewards card now will i get any sign up bonus,btohqsg
So i will not get any rewards as a existing customer?,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve heard that if you cancel your card and wait for a year  you might become eligible for a New-to-Bank (NTB) reward again. Is that true?,btohqsg
yes. you need to really confirm that 1 year period.,btohqsg
