we may say that money that comes easy is lost easyI think one of the smartlocal stories shared that perspective too- but that is a phase  a part of the journey that most of us go thru too (getting our first 4 digit paycheque  we feel rich  we spend)but I think there's a silver lining. precisely because they are exposed to wealth early and how easily it is lost- they start the process of proper financial planning  financial literacy much much earlier,btohqsg
Yup  rather than saying they are lucky  I would say they have the guts to take risk and are now rewarded. Given the same situation  I may not have takent the risk at all.,btohqsg
"Haha can add one more option. ""I can't top up SA anymore""",btohqsg
Sir  you have done well ‚úÖI will reach there next year!,btohqsg
Removed due to out of topic,btohqsg
Does anyone know if a employee can topup their CPF to Max $17740 for the year to enjoy the max income tax relief? Or this topup is only for self employed person?,btohqsg
You can voluntary contribute to your MA up to $37 740 CPF contribution limit for 2021. VCMA is eligible for tax relief,btohqsg
So lets say you earned total $50 000 annual income. 37% of it will be $18 500. You have a gap of $19 240 to contribute MA for tax relief  assuming your MA has not reached BHS,btohqsg
Next year will be different though  I will talk about it tonight,btohqsg
So can only contribute to MA  not OA?,btohqsg
You can't specifically contribute OA only. Can only VC to all 3 Accounts and that has no tax relief,btohqsg
Thanks. That was the key point I wanted to find out. No benefit for employee to topup if no tax relief.,btohqsg
Another question and this is on SRS. What will happen to stocks purchased using SRS after age 62?,btohqsg
Is it worth topping up kids Medisave account? If yes  what‚Äôs the max amount one should top-up?,btohqsg
U can continue to contribute and invest after 62 as long as you haven't started your withdrawal cycle. Once you start withdrawing then you cant invest/contribute anymore,btohqsg
This is highly subjective to individual but I won't do it. Rather top up your parents CPF for tax relief,btohqsg
That's not what I am asking. Let's say you have 10 000 DBS shares purchased over the years before age 62. Would you need to withdraw the shares? What happen if you sell off the shares before or after the 10 year withdrawal period?,btohqsg
This was answered in my SRS video,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks! I will view it. üòÅ,btohqsg
Couldnt find the answer...:-( I think I didn't make myself clear. Do I have to sell my shares and withdraw the cash I liquidated from shares? Yes right? :-),btohqsg
Short answer  is no need to sell can transfer outThanks@boontee86,btohqsg
Anyway you have a unique situation as most people can't wait to take it out at 62,btohqsg
We're sharing same thing üëçüèªYou're welcomeStanleyüôèüèª,btohqsg
Not unique lah. Just trying to see how to plan how to make full use of the tax free withdrawals after 62. I probably would sell and withdrawal those non-dividend stocks instead of transferring out.,btohqsg
Yes  more important to plan your own strategy that works well for you towards retirement planning!,btohqsg
But hor  I suspect there would be a fee for transferring SRS stocks to CDP. Anybody know?,btohqsg
This guy said in Jan 2021 that crash is impeding. Sell all now. So we are at November 2021 and...?,btohqsg
I think just watching Bloomberg is not enough,btohqsg
try this one  1 hour podcast then you will better understand his perspective,btohqsg
I might not recall correctly  but I remember his bubble comment is not to the general market. He was commenting on pocket of bubbles especially on the SPAC. One company he mentioned was QuantumScape (which he invested since pre-IPO)  but the valuation was just crazy early of the year,btohqsg
QS dropped since beginning of this year,btohqsg
Bloomberg/CNBC like to pick small part of interview and make their own stories. It will much more sensational by referring to entire market,btohqsg
So usually they like to write sensational headlines like what will crash next week pls sell all now cos they want ppl to lose out or so they can buy the dip?,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/HNBqS4yaRVMEven ppl like him trying to hoard cash to buy the dip in anticipation of market crash,btohqsg
"in general all news that describe ""market may crash soon"" will attract views  so news agency has tendency to show these",btohqsg
but the interview video that you shared is quite long also  so this one also worth watching  thanks for sharing,btohqsg
i will be more cautious on those 3-5 minutes video (especially coming from CNBC) because they tend to pick the most sensational part to show,btohqsg
time in the market is better than timing the market,btohqsg
Everyone diff strategy.. his may not be the same anymore. He isn't that young now .,btohqsg
Buffett's cash pile question was raised during annual shareholder meeting- Cash on hand 15% of values of BRK businesses- Back the insurance liabilities including catastrophic event- Market valuation is high  so Buffett hesitant to deploy- He is okay to buyback BRK shares  but if price too high then he will not do it,btohqsg
I hope Chris can talk more about reitüëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
Passive income and low risk better put the money in Fixed deposit,btohqsg
Thanks for the idea  will draft something about it,btohqsg
I finally withdraw from syfe retis cos their returns has been dismal. Even if I put into value stocks and JnJ or P&G still can earn more lol ü§¢,btohqsg
The last portfolio I've left in syfe in the core. Still thinking whether to withdraw  cos I don't want exposure to China kraneshares and I've specific ETFs in mind alr,btohqsg
Like semiconductor ETFs like SOXX  SMH. Bascually take inspiration by browsing through syfe custom. But I won't do it on syfe cos why must I pay syfe 0.65% monthly comission on top of the fees for etf,btohqsg
I'm agreed with you  I also left in syfe  now I put in moomoo mapletree industrial and logistics and j69U  because at sfye we cannot see price at how much we putüòÇ,btohqsg
For syfe I use the customise one haha bc I will be price sensitive if I were to buy myself via the brokers. So just select a portfolio of etfs   and dca each month   it will help me buy fractional shares as well,btohqsg
Ya. Plus got time delay. Mapletree and Ascendas are quite solid. May consider them on tiger. the issue with syfe reits is got alot of funny retis inside  drag down the whole portfoilio,btohqsg
Yaya time delay 2working day  I personal felt tiger and moomoo more convenient we also can know that what price we buy in and sell outüòÇ,btohqsg
