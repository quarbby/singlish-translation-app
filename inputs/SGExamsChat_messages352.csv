He gonna ask his genshin gang beat u up,btohqsg
Sucking at games is not a bad thing,btohqsg
cos gymming studying and family time >>> games,btohqsg
Never thought id see this place again,btohqsg
what do u want them to do anyways,btohqsg
set up a canteen upstairs or smth,btohqsg
Something that isnt a weird empty space,btohqsg
most of my chers are leaving mi with us,btohqsg
like at least half of the teachers i wld like to keep in contact with lol,btohqsg
meh ppl use it for pw pics anyways,btohqsg
U make me feel bad for not keeping in contact w any of em,btohqsg
Oh i guess it do be a nice background,btohqsg
and the wall at the toilet,btohqsg
My favourite math teacher is in ej now :(,btohqsg
He'd be so proud im once again failing uni math,btohqsg
actually i dont even know wheres my calculator,btohqsg
what if i need it for uni,btohqsg
Eh my gc of 6 years old still works,btohqsg
Pol sci need calc for wat,btohqsg
i have ccas etc that i want there,btohqsg
Damn didnt even know this was offered anywhere,btohqsg
Wait you are taking As now ah,btohqsg
minor in religious studies to be more specific,btohqsg
but given any module options im looking towards christianity,btohqsg
The outdoor adventure powerlifting esports all look cool,btohqsg
Imma study hard both nus and ntu got fun ccas,btohqsg
i was thinking pssoc fencing and motoring club,btohqsg
thats why i rlly rlly wanna go nus,btohqsg
i heard smu got a catholic club or smth üò≠üò≠üò≠ idrk bro,btohqsg
but its interesting to know abt it,btohqsg
cuz yk theres cults and stuff,btohqsg
like understanding the history etc behind it,btohqsg
but then its just an added bonus yannooo,btohqsg
Thought NUS/NTU honours system is more lenient than SMU,btohqsg
I wanna go gym or a party cca,btohqsg
Im in nus n i dun find anything particularly interesting in nus ccas siaüí©üí©,btohqsg
that way I can find like minded people,btohqsg
When I went for scholarship interview while in NUS  I told the interviewers my CCA is tuition,btohqsg
Something about straight B+ in SMU is classified worse than a straight B+ in NUS/NTU?,btohqsg
and plus my priorities are done too,btohqsg
plus im comfortable with nus culture,btohqsg
This one can join kr or sheares,btohqsg
i think i‚Äôll js go for lessons and js run back home,btohqsg
then i look look see see,btohqsg
go nus swimming pool to swim at 12 noon,btohqsg
The class part culture here is stronk  can create class part clubs,btohqsg
I heard they choose based on social media and I started so late ig not many follower and stuff and I am not into the ... yk,btohqsg
Dont laugh leh. That was me back then leh.,btohqsg
yeah i heard smu clubbing culture is so crazy,btohqsg
Nus culture is literally mugging kekw,btohqsg
but not clubbing though maybe like hiking or nature stuff barbeque. Ouhh haha got it outdoor adventure,btohqsg
idg clubbing though whats fun about it,btohqsg
U can go hall or rc probably,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it harder to get a better honours classification in SMU? Eg a straight b+ will get you a ‚Äúhigh merit‚Äù but a straight B+ in NUS/NTU is a upper second class honours,btohqsg
uni is prob where u find ur lifelong partner,btohqsg
i lowkey doubt i can find a good family man who goes partying all the time ah,btohqsg
i like guys that are rlly hardworking and mugger culture type beat,btohqsg
plus i want date for a while like at least 3 yrs before thinking abt marriage,btohqsg
Studying is also for personal achievement,btohqsg
good study man and gorl gorl = secure future,btohqsg
then fitness is covered once you get fit,btohqsg
at least at the uni level i can kinda trust guy got his life set tgt,btohqsg
Not from what i observe in the hostel toilets kekw,btohqsg
Nothing wrong with what I said,btohqsg
But doesn‚Äôt it suck that you (SMU) get a lower classification with the same grades of someone from another Uni (ie NUS/NTU),btohqsg
my sch be kinda suckish i dont even tell ppl im from mi,btohqsg
i just be like ‚Äúoh yeah im studying for my a‚Äôs‚Äù,btohqsg
idk la it boils down to curriculum culture etc la,btohqsg
Erm I m ur junior HAHA,btohqsg
I found mi quite enjoyable ngl,btohqsg
one half of the lit powerhouse leaving mi alr,btohqsg
mr chee leaving mi like next yr methinks,btohqsg
Ohh he‚Äôs yet to teach me if he is,btohqsg
and its rlly ms steph and mr chee thats ü§åüèªü§åüèª,btohqsg
A lvl impt ah dont fk it up,btohqsg
Im alrdy in uni but thanks,btohqsg
One of the year 3s got 23/25 for unseen poetry üò≥,btohqsg
i hope more in your own words,btohqsg
I think cambrigde will do some weird stuff for sure,btohqsg
a comment I saw on Reddit will be perfect for this,btohqsg
and the number of upvotes is perfect,btohqsg
sleep  friends  study - choose 2 :),btohqsg
take it as an actual break,btohqsg
ooo bedok got gf alr ah,btohqsg
uhhh it's a big range...my undergrad friends range from got their life completely set to still taking a break before finding job,btohqsg
and they grad 5 months ago,btohqsg
good luck to those working hard,btohqsg
and better luck to those not working hard,btohqsg
ok i typed before reading your later 2 messages,btohqsg
once u go uni kids u never go back,btohqsg
Attracted to what u dont hv ig,btohqsg
Its her drive for benchpress pr,btohqsg
drive to study is hoping to do okay for a‚Äôs,btohqsg
the only time i ever run,btohqsg
don't burn out before finishing lol,btohqsg
thats what yall say at o‚Äôs,btohqsg
‚Äúuni is a rlly small thing‚Äù,btohqsg
‚Äúretiring is a rlly small thing‚Äù,btohqsg
As grades only abt the uni course,btohqsg
but ur uni determinant to where u go,btohqsg
I cant say much for ur aspirations,btohqsg
unless u on some crazy meds to change paths mid career drastically,btohqsg
But for me its rlly more of internship and connections,btohqsg
uni is the time to enjoy,btohqsg
U never know what's gonna happen in the future,btohqsg
So dun be too stuck up,btohqsg
Uni is what u make of it,btohqsg
No ones telling u what to do,btohqsg
how do u even do thay anyways,btohqsg
But also rlly dependent on faculty,btohqsg
There is no enjoyment but that A+ grade,btohqsg
If ur faculty is insane muggers,btohqsg
Cuz life is unpredictable. Just like I would assume you didn't expect to hit the gym but u did and now u like working out,btohqsg
U hv no choice but to mug with them,btohqsg
imagine switching from idk accounting to retailing,btohqsg
Imagine gg from cs to law,btohqsg
but its like switching complete diff skills set,btohqsg
Bruh imagine u switch from accounting to a singer,btohqsg
If ur faculty full of clubbers and pagent kings n queens,btohqsg
but when it comes to career change  it's mainly transferable skills from your previous work,btohqsg
talking abt the non transferable ones,btohqsg
If u wan to be rich,btohqsg
Im studying accounting right now but I just signed a record deal,btohqsg
you'd have to take outside stuff to make up for knowledge you need lor,btohqsg
I hv some seniors who make 20k a month as fresh grad,btohqsg
Bruh here am i thinking what is a study break cuz i thought Os starts  on Mon üíÄ,btohqsg
bedok giving out constant Ls today fr,btohqsg
i accepted being poor the moment i decided to pursue academia (potentially),btohqsg
maybe not poor but never rich,btohqsg
hes in his andrew tate fuck everyone moment,btohqsg
the stress gets to us my deary,btohqsg
sometimes it may feel like we will be constant failures,btohqsg
my plan is just having enough to start family etc,btohqsg
but provided i get to where i want ah,btohqsg
that aint gonna let u survive in sg,btohqsg
success is having my family + stable income,btohqsg
U can be a whiny bitch and complain about how we're in sg. Or we can make use of it and be successful,btohqsg
come to terms with just chilling around alr,btohqsg
If u run for elections i vote for u,btohqsg
two combined incomes can bring kids go good places gai gai and feed the family comfortably good liao,btohqsg
my further aim is actually leaving sg but i have plans for if i end up staying,btohqsg
sg just not the best for my goals la haha,btohqsg
In other countries u get mugged the moment u in the airport,btohqsg
man i just want to have kids,btohqsg
can always travel if u have the moolah,btohqsg
and tbh idw to put my potential kids through the sg education system,btohqsg
if not by robbers by taxi drivers,btohqsg
western europe somewhere  depends on where i can get postdoc/faculty positions lor,btohqsg
If u dun kenna robbed in europe  its not the full europe experience,btohqsg
No cancel culture in other countries like Europe. Not as strong as sg,btohqsg
rmbred almost getting robbed when i went europe,btohqsg
ppl got no life but cancel online and stuff,btohqsg
But is it worth being second class citizen,btohqsg
in europe grps like this prob aint gonna happen innit,btohqsg
which tbf is big in sg too but,btohqsg
too big of a country anyways,btohqsg
good luck getting faculty positions man as a local,btohqsg
competition is too high and they like foreign talent,btohqsg
the only quantum ik is from marvel,btohqsg
Just whatever u do. Do ur best. Support family. Be a W parent and make enuff money to not worry about utilities  food or bills,btohqsg
And don't let ur kids watch cocomelon,btohqsg
first sem of phd i think i getting unhinged alr,btohqsg
Huge L. U need to watch Popeye's,btohqsg
oh man i used to watch popeye‚Äôs religiously as a kid,btohqsg
Anyone that has the mindset of aiya cannot make it one lah. Or I die already. Or I pass away.Ur jinxing urself well done!SRS tho people need to wake the fuck up and grind. Dun be a pussy be the top G.,btohqsg
If u in sch u grind studies,btohqsg
If u outside u grind work,btohqsg
Then wat? Grind getting a gf?,btohqsg
Thats very asian way of thinking,btohqsg
But nowadays u cant make it being hardworking alone,btohqsg
U can afford a condo n a car for sure,btohqsg
Grind fake friendships so u can manipulate them to succeed?,btohqsg
If u put it as such,btohqsg
Idk I've always had alot of philosophical thinking,btohqsg
Sometimes the least impt is hardwork,btohqsg
Prob not everyone wants to hear it.,btohqsg
i cant stand ppl who act all ‚Äúi cant do this‚Äù,btohqsg
Dont get sucked up into the sigma grindset things my guy,btohqsg
"i think there's a lot of nuances and there's never the ""oh must do this""",btohqsg
if u cant do it drop out then üòÄ,btohqsg
like yea don't slack  you gotta work hard,btohqsg
Even shaq went to get PHD,btohqsg
sigma grindset long run rest and relax,btohqsg
U can sigma grindset but rest,btohqsg
Btw u have any recommendations for gyms?,btohqsg
No ah but everything needs to be based on what u want in life,btohqsg
in my program  these statements are more of imposter syndrome,btohqsg
onlyfans can get u millions alr,btohqsg
If 10k a month at 30 is rich to u then wtv ig,btohqsg
He's just being a normal gen X,btohqsg
but yah theres no way to become 5bil+ without either business or inheritance,btohqsg
During the war  life is hard,btohqsg
My goal in life is to get married,btohqsg
I think I can make it,btohqsg
Sourcing gf in sg exams chat,btohqsg
I have to be rich first,btohqsg
Ig dont go uni with the mindset of it being the natural next step,btohqsg
Go to uni thinking that it's a good experience to mingle,btohqsg
In this regard guys hv it better,btohqsg
We hv 2 years to sort our shit out,btohqsg
I mean... Girls have some time after poly or JC,btohqsg
U rlly need some time to think abt what u want in life,btohqsg
its not even a silver lining,btohqsg
the thing abt ns is that its forced,btohqsg
Good shit tho. Make friends there,btohqsg
Get shouted at and man the fuck up,btohqsg
And then go army to discover that ur a masochist all along,btohqsg
2 years of playing league in camp,btohqsg
Ping is respond rate in my term HAHA,btohqsg
My friends always having high pings during ranks,btohqsg
Where the wifi was p good,btohqsg
I was gnna extend my condolences,btohqsg
U guessed I was a guy-,btohqsg
Tyty means I blend in well,btohqsg
I mean hard to tell frm behind the screen,btohqsg
I have sea ppl creating banners for me HAHA,btohqsg
I feel righteous anger on behalf of ur teammate,btohqsg
Uh they q enjoy it tho,btohqsg
I got flamed last time i drop my survey link here üò¢,btohqsg
Before I make u climb moutain,btohqsg
But in league terms it's called ping-,btohqsg
I vvv noob and loyal to one game,btohqsg
And my sleep cycle is capital F fucked,btohqsg
spent the entire night trying to understand smth,btohqsg
What don‚Äôt you get about Lorentz,btohqsg
completely do not understand wtf Lorentz transform is,btohqsg
what is a principal of relativity,btohqsg
I rather do econs than this,btohqsg
gives me so much less pain,btohqsg
no la not h2 haha  if h2 half of Singapore is gna kill themselves,btohqsg
This is my Uni year 1 haha,btohqsg
I have 2 weeks to learn electrodynamics and Lorentz transform lol,btohqsg
Yea spho a lot of content is Uni y1,btohqsg
Gude u not in Olympiad meh,btohqsg
As in Lorentz transform is just like your Galilean transformation but accounting for the speed of light postulate,btohqsg
So you transform wrt to spacetime and not just distance,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall got use the Minkowski spacetime diagram?,btohqsg
Tbh I‚Äôll say the Lorentz transform is not very intuitive even for me in a diagram,btohqsg
And I‚Äôd just focus on how the Lorentz factor changes the different quantities since that‚Äôs what the main difference in the equations is,btohqsg
idk wtf they want from us anymore,btohqsg
Newtonian relativity was already bad enuf,btohqsg
eh you‚Äôre stepping into modern physics realm,btohqsg
for now just know how to use the equations to get your time dilation etc  and if got spacetime diagram  learning how to use it was a headache for me,btohqsg
That's all I'm planning to do,btohqsg
no way I'm gna fkn try to unds what happened in 1930,btohqsg
Electrodynamics I think is manageable ba,btohqsg
no thank you I'm not touching physics ever again,btohqsg
electric field strength from first principals,btohqsg
If you go quantum mechanics it‚Äôs a lot of linear algebra,btohqsg
idw ever touch this subject again,btohqsg
no I'm never touching physics ever again,btohqsg
"whatever  demonic ""transform"" is going out of my mind",btohqsg
Electrodynamics just understand how the different quantities relate in terms of calculus,btohqsg
So you can find the ‚Äúsmall piece‚Äù to integrate lol,btohqsg
electrodynamics feels like gravitation reused lol,btohqsg
Instead of mass is charge alr,btohqsg
Yes there‚Äôs a lot of similarities,btohqsg
just that they can change the material slightly or the shape and make it confusing,btohqsg
I can show u some qns,btohqsg
gude lend me some of the ri brain,btohqsg
I need the RI brain to do this qn,btohqsg
my smol fly brain can't handle,btohqsg
need ur brain in every other subject,btohqsg
You got velocity transformation equations in your Lorentz transform so try to express them in terms of angle theta,btohqsg
You know the photon has speed c  so what‚Äôs the speed in the x and x‚Äô direction?,btohqsg
my favourite math teacher is TKS,btohqsg
iirc this one won't be this cursed,btohqsg
the more cursed one is if they give u x' and ask u to find x,btohqsg
have seen they give u x and u find x' one LOL,btohqsg
Then it's some cursed matrix things idw to get into,btohqsg
but it's kindaexpress the matrix r as a rotational matrix from r',btohqsg
then  we find the inverse of the rotational matrix  left hand side we'll get a matrix multiplication  and rhs well get the multiplication of an identity matrix and r'  then we can get the transformation from r to r',btohqsg
help me I don't like what I'm doing,btohqsg
Gude like that how to get top 1 in ri,btohqsg
top 1 in ri now sleeping,btohqsg
Actually no  top 1 in ri now waking up to grind bio already,btohqsg
how Abt u recite the process,btohqsg
oo yea makes sense since Lorentz transform is linear and can be seen as a rotation in spacetime. Didn‚Äôt expect them to incorporate linear algebra into it haha,btohqsg
MAX MAX MAX SUPER MAX MAX SUPER SUPER,btohqsg
@chemcerstudying af makes me pissed af.,btohqsg
i have geog paper nex week,btohqsg
i rather learn about like un goals,btohqsg
that time between aus and timor,btohqsg
i want to talk about annexations man,btohqsg
i cannot rmb the other 2,btohqsg
but ukraine bombed the crimea bridge,btohqsg
so idk if crimea is still under russia or ukraine,btohqsg
MAX MAX MAX SUPER MAX MAX MAX,btohqsg
ya bruh cyclones flood storm surges,btohqsg
