So at least a level performance wise for each sch we have a rough idea,btohqsg
With options  it is back to the students and parents to make the best decisions for themselves,btohqsg
Yeah I understand they‚Äôre different  but ultimately to me as long as no one else is restricted from taking As  and the results are likely to improve with this move  there‚Äôs nothing to lose,btohqsg
Some delulu parents will just force their kids to go to Jc even if they don‚Äôt want to and can‚Äôt cope with the rigour of a 2 year course,btohqsg
If the decision makers remove options based on this  then the tables will be turned and they can get accused of depriving optionsIf the students and parents make the decisions to not take up less than ideal options  then the decision makers can rethink options by saying ‚Äúdwindling popularity‚Äù,btohqsg
Additionally  the decision makers have also made available many more uni and uni spots,btohqsg
Yeah I guess they‚Äôre in a tight spot  but if they had the courage to do the mergers  I guess they can surely try doing what I suggested and see how it  goes. They can also float trial balloons to see whether the public is generally supportive of it  and I definitely do.,btohqsg
Mergers are an outcome of dwindling popularity and overall population for the younger cohorts. I think it is clear what can drive decisions: needs and popularity,btohqsg
if failed J1  transfer to 3 years class.,btohqsg
Another week  Let the afk intern grind begin,btohqsg
They probably will need a new JC in Tengah,btohqsg
Yeah I suppose  but from what I‚Äôve seen  I think that yi shouldn‚Äôt just continue to exist in that form and it should be abolished or just converted to a CI. Beyond providing more choices to those with a raw l1r5 of close to 20 (like maybe 17-20 range)  those who end up going there whether they like it or not see worse outcomes than those who went to MI. Every decision will have their tradeoffs and to me the tradeoff of restricting ppl with a high l1r5 from going to JC in turn of increasing the likelihood of better results is worth it,btohqsg
Aren‚Äôt all JCs just 2 years? Unless you‚Äôre saying that you got transferred to MI,btohqsg
It is sad but my friend fr yi shared that some of the std were forced to end up there  it is q sad,btohqsg
I feel like in such cases the students know better but their parents are overbearing,btohqsg
I mean they should do this,btohqsg
Based on my impression of some of the (potential) decision makers through some brief interactions ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think ‚Äúpoor performance‚Äù will make them ‚Äúremove options‚ÄùI think ‚Äúwaning popularity‚Äù willIf it is ‚Äúpoor performance‚Äù  I think the decision makers‚Äô advice will be for the institutes to buck up,btohqsg
Then the students can‚Äôt choose for themselves what they think would give themselves the best outcome,btohqsg
Erm like it is not practical for all schools to run 2 and 3y programme concurrently,btohqsg
Maybe one JC will get shifted to Tengah  rather than to start a new oneA level is definitely not as popular as before,btohqsg
Actually if their parents throw them there nd they are so demotivated  then it defeats the purpose,btohqsg
Btw are u a chem jc teacher,btohqsg
If there is a need to be addressed  I think a shift is more likely than to start a new one,btohqsg
Erm i dun think it is a good idea to cut anymore  the merger of the 8 jcs has done enough damage,btohqsg
I see. It‚Äôs hard to tell if YI cop is 20 almost all the time cos of waning popularity or moe just basically forces them to accept as many students as they can so that those who get raw 20 will have the option of going to a JC. If it‚Äôs the latter  then I think  that‚Äôs alr a sign that they should tighten the requirements for JC,btohqsg
WAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAH the one qn i didn‚Äôt want to answer ü´•I was but i am no longer,btohqsg
And u think by making it not there will solve the parental overbearing issue‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Mm yeah I think poly popularity is still rising,btohqsg
Oh so u went into private or,btohqsg
I dun think moe forces them to accept as many std as the demand is‚Ä¶that was why there was a yr it fell below 20,btohqsg
I think cutting by 2-3 points to see how it goes first will work. No doubt it will cause an uproar among parents who want to force their kids to go to JC even if their results aren‚Äôt stellar  but eventually students as a whole would be better off,btohqsg
For the most part. Even the times where sci stream fell to 19  most of them who entered likely had one bonus point,btohqsg
But while the bulk of it is what it is  there are ppl who choose YI base on location coz look  there are not many jc choices u hv if u score above 12/13,btohqsg
people look at cop20 will avoid. When the JCs merge  COP of them lowers so those that cannot make it just goes to better courses in Poly like Sciences and Accountancy  leading to lower cop for these courses,btohqsg
ASR is legit not very far away from YI,btohqsg
And u want someone living in north to be travelling to pasir ris,btohqsg
Haha but my plan is to join social work sector in 10 years‚Äô time if conditions allow. See how!,btohqsg
Yes but what is ASR cut off‚Ä¶what if u score 12/13,btohqsg
With the new campus I mean. The old srjc campus is then quite far,btohqsg
I know someone who go yi coz asr rejected,btohqsg
Another option is to overhaul the YI leadership and also still tighten the entry requirements. If LCM and the previous principal can bring NY cop down a lot (same for srjc principal)  I think more can be done to improve YI‚Äôs fate rather than to leave the worst ppl to lead the sch,btohqsg
When was the last time YI had a new principal?,btohqsg
Do you think we want (to be seen as) a society where decision makers make decisions for the non-decision makers in this manner?It will take a while but hopefully the younger parents will be more enlightened and wiser about what works and what do not work for their children üëçüèΩ,btohqsg
They never changed principal since the merger despite all other JCs receiving a new one by now,btohqsg
Ok i dunno the sitution in yi but i dun think it is a good idea to forcefully cut the cop but rather leave it to market forces to decide,btohqsg
Erm i dun think a change in principal by now has anything got to do w the merger,btohqsg
Yeah sg govt is top down  but sometimes ppl in leadership must be willing to make tough decisions even if some ppl do not like it. As for the 2nd para  I rly do hope so but unfortunately ppl‚Äôs mindsets would be hard to change.,btohqsg
A principal can be w a school for very long,btohqsg
Yeah still the same old de Silva from innova jc,btohqsg
I think it will be better off to leave it to market forces,btohqsg
