Snapdragon 865 still hasn't even beaten A12,btohqsg
guys we shouldn't speak about Exynos 990,btohqsg
A14 is gonna use a 5nm finFET process,btohqsg
Exynos 990's chipset can fry an omelette,btohqsg
Read the reviews  the S20 which ships with Exynos 990 are fucking laggy and hot,btohqsg
Yeah  but they're also using older ARM cores,btohqsg
Intel locks their clocks  so only the k processors can overclock past its stated clockspeedsAmd doesn't lock so you can go and overclock,btohqsg
let's be real  Intel just want money of enthusiasts,btohqsg
I'm holding off until Note 20 comes out because they ship with a Snapdragon 865+ as well as upgraded displays and RAM,btohqsg
Speaking of which  Samsung is changing it's Exynos chips to AMD,btohqsg
is my next phone gonna be by AMD,btohqsg
I want a 4900HS powered Note 20,btohqsg
I'm entirely passing on Samsung flagship phones,btohqsg
You need to go buy proper mobo  (for intel  the k processor) and spend money on beefier cooler,btohqsg
The stock coolers work just fine at stock speeds,btohqsg
AMD coolers work p well for mild overclocking,btohqsg
Yeah i don't even bother lel,btohqsg
Just auto set up and ready to go,btohqsg
Not that powerful HAHAHAHA and not that soon too,btohqsg
Samsung has the capability to make a powerful phone,btohqsg
Well technically you can squeeze more performance out of your chip and it can be quite significant,btohqsg
at least Apple chips don't overheat unlike Samsung Exynos 990,btohqsg
Oh quick qn is s20 worth it,btohqsg
don't say this in front of the tosic Apple fanboy,btohqsg
and for that reason I'll go for iPhone 11 over S20,btohqsg
no lah I'm not an apple fanboy,btohqsg
I rather get the note 10 tho,btohqsg
Which is better for playing games tho i dont really care abt cam,btohqsg
Galaxy Note series > S series,btohqsg
S20+ US pricing more than iPhone 11 Pro Max sia,btohqsg
Wait for Note 20  that's what I'm doing,btohqsg
I was gonna get the Note 10+ when I recontract but my parents be like 'uh no',btohqsg
If you die die want S20  order from the USA store,btohqsg
tbh i dont use my phone  alot,btohqsg
S20 series is a blunder imo,btohqsg
it's been a year + and my battery has gone a little to shit,btohqsg
If you order from USA  it ships with Snapdragon 865  and those phones are fucking good,btohqsg
what phones do u guys recommend then,btohqsg
im getting a phone next week,btohqsg
120Hz display and 8K video recording with a 108MP camera,btohqsg
8k is a gimmick that has no practical use,btohqsg
if you have money or you're in Apple ecosystem? iPhone 11 or 11 Pro,btohqsg
I rather have good 4k recording,btohqsg
It's NOT AS GOOD AS IT SEEMS,btohqsg
YOU CAN'T EVEN USE 120Hz wih max resolution,btohqsg
4K 60 FPS is still there so it's good,btohqsg
but i heard iphone 9 coming out,btohqsg
if you like small body ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
If you can do without Google  go for P40,btohqsg
Order from USA store to get this,btohqsg
