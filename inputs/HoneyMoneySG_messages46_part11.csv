Tie to Citi cash rewards card  rejected but when I skip instarem and use Citi cash rewards card directly  it approvedSo I wonder if anyone here has experience with exchange foreign fund in casino setting using instarem card?,btohqsg
Usually casino MCC is excluded so you basically pay forex fees (and possibly card usage fees at the casino) but get no rewards. Cheaper to withdraw from atm using Trust card and then exchange for chips at the cashier.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  can we cancel the OCBC card through OCBC mobile app ? Like UOB app  there is a button to allow us directly cancel the card from the app,btohqsg

In the unlikely scenario you top up to child account 100% FRS at age 0  may end up with scenario where majority of funds are reserved right?anyone knows if RSTU top up that are part of reserved funds including interest above the frs- can these be withdrawn at age 55?,btohqsg
My understanding (happy to be corrected) is reserved funds issue is only applicable if u meet brs but donâ€™t meet frs.If u are able to meet frs  all amounts above frs can be withdrawn in cash regardless of how much are reserved.,btohqsg

I went down to hsbc branch to check on the additional 1% cashback on top of its credit card. The comes in the form of 1% cashback when u use your EGA to pay your hsbc cc bill i.e 1% of CC spent,btohqsg
On top of that  it has to be giro paid. Cannot be paid on-demand even if its from ega,btohqsg
Exclude EGA pay for your HSBC cc bill. Only valid if using EGA pay for your non-HSBC cc bill via Giro.,btohqsg
I noticed the CSO shared quite afew info which are conflicting with what the people shared here...so i dont know who to believe. And very disappoint with the FD opening process. End up i did not open the ega nor the FD,btohqsg
