🏋Pika World Insights – 26 Jan 2022🗝Equity markets continued on their roller-coaster ride with significant earnings on the way. AMEX had a good run  and shares popped higher. Microsoft results were in line  but guidances disappointed. The stock fell sharply in after-hours only to recover as markets digest the latest corporate earnings to get a sense of the economy's strength.💰FOMC: All hopes and eagle eyes🚘The Fed will be the main focus of the day. However  two critical components  the interest rate hike and balance sheet runoff  are back in the game.⛳Interest rate and stock prices🧨While interest rate hikes often cause a market downturn leading up to the first hike  stocks tend to rise in the period after the rate hike. Nonetheless  this time  such a trend may not be taken as a whole.The key is that in periods of the market upward trend with an interest rate hike  the Fed balance sheet has remained stable/sideway. In the current context  the risk is the combination of an interest rate hike coupled with a potential for a shrinking balance sheet means more downside risk for the stock. This means P/E compression as less liquidity is chasing assets.With that  Pika World maintains a cautious outlook and await the Fed to clear uncertainty and hopefully  that gives traders a risk-on appetite for the time being.Have a splendid day Pika Nat.,btohqsg
