Hi  I'm looking to DCA into sg stocks like DBS and parkway life monthly via giro/recurring transfer. Any platform to recommend? The focus is only sg stocks. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Saw another youtuber mentioned our spotify payment is settled overseas then got rejected  but netflix is settled locally so is approved,btohqsg
I'm in the midst of withdrawing from my friend's family plan. Going wait for him to take me out first.,btohqsg
I heard you need to charge the spotify subscription to that card.,btohqsg
That card meaning the CDC card? No need. I use Amex to pay. Then I email them my amex bill showing the Spotify transaction. Then they reimburse me. üëç,btohqsg
Just curious  why don't you pay with your CRC card?,btohqsg
Because the CDC card can't be added as a payment method in Spotify for some reason. Tried a few times so I emailed them that I couldn't add it as payment method. So they told me to email them my amex statement and they will reimburse,btohqsg
So you need to email them the statement every month?,btohqsg
nope. I've only done so for January. I got the reimbursement for Jan and Feb. Not sure how they track also. (i also wonder about this loophole),btohqsg

Do anyone know how to use cardup or ipaymy hit the minimum spend on credit card?,btohqsg
I use CardUp for Company‚Äôs spending (Rental  Salary  CPF etc) it‚Äôs usually more than $20k a monthWhat small transection do Consumers spend on‚ùì,btohqsg
I intend to use cardup to pay for my insurances and etc. Then use my UOB One to pay for cardup  So that I can hit the minimum spending of $500 every month for the cash back for my other spendings,btohqsg
how do I allocate 100% to lionglobal 500 on my endowus? (At account creation phase),btohqsg
yes the cardup payment charged to UOB one card is counted towards the spending to earn cashback,btohqsg
"build your own portfolio of ""ONE""",btohqsg
"then you select only ""lionglobal 500"" for that fundsmart",btohqsg
Hi sifu  any tips or hacks for paying in Nets? Something like topping up using amex Cashback to earn extra Cashback etc?,btohqsg
Dorsett Hotel $100 from Trip dot comTrip Hotel weekend sale!https://bit.ly/35llhzA,btohqsg
Your best bet is amex  grabpay  nets flashpay card. Nothing for Nets,btohqsg
Indeed quite irritating where merchant only take nets or cash payment. I can't use any of my cards,btohqsg
you can try DBS Live Fresh  that's the card I turn to for NETS,btohqsg
But I can't hit the minimum spending on that card. So it's kinda useless for me. Only in for the sign up bonus,btohqsg
hihi  for endowus general investing portfolio  are you able to choose the ETF and allocate the % for each fund? or is by chosen and allocated by endowus?,btohqsg
fund smart allow u to diy the % you want for each fund,btohqsg
will be cheaper if you create multiple fund smart goal with only one fund (100% one fund only)but more troublesome when you want to top up $$,btohqsg
To me  a 4 star hotel below $120/night should be good,btohqsg
Okay I try booking for my WFHotel in April,btohqsg
Yeah staycation is quite underrated  especially during COVID when we cant travel overseas for cheaper hotels. Sometimes a different environment can enhance your mental wellbeing,btohqsg

Jus saw the dorsett one  wonder got breakfast buffet included,btohqsg
Any idea if the following cards are eligible for Cashback when paying for public hospital medical bills:1) UOB One2) Stand chart unlimited3) HSBC advanceMoneysmart mentioned it's eligible in 2022 but t&c of those cards seem to say not applicable for Cashback.Does anyone know or try before?,btohqsg

Just watched your video on Should I Top up CPF SA or MA first? | VCMA vs RSTU   So if top up RSTU   means permanently not able to withdraw anymore?,btohqsg
How much for accom per night? Where?,btohqsg
Sofitel City Centre around $155++ to $178++,btohqsg
Second one nicer toilet n bed view,btohqsg
I have a question on this video. Will the RSTU funds be used to form the FRS for RA? So I can take out more of my normal contributions at age 55 if I do RSTU.,btohqsg
RA always take money from SA first. RSTU-SA will increase the SA amount reserved that cannot be shielded,btohqsg
Meaning your advice is to use the OA to SA method  what if i use both OA to SA and RSTU to SA?,btohqsg
Sure  I did that too concurrently,btohqsg
just make sure you have enough OA to use for investing/housing/education stuff before transferring,btohqsg
Must we really RSTU by 31 Dec to enjoy tax relief  but CPF says we will earn more interest if we top up in Jan?,btohqsg
If use cpf to buy house whats  the  balance required to remain in the cpf acc?,btohqsg
am i able to do this for ibkr i was trying to figure out and i couldnt!,btohqsg
