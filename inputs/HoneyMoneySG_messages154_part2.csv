Hi everyone a question on credit card for airport lounge access  I have 2 companions that I would like bring them to lounge. I have 2 credit cards that offers 1+1 lounge access. Can I use these 2 cards together? What I research is a mix of response of Yes and No. Also  the tnc doesnt offer much info on this.,btohqsg
Based on T&C  no. Only 1 card per person.Reality  some managed to do it  some didn't.,btohqsg
If I link heymax to any CC  so many purchase via the Cc will earn me maxmiles?Or must be limited to online shopping displayed in the heymax app?Or can only earn miles using the chocolate card,btohqsg
It is just another shopback and can track mcc.,btohqsg

can earn max miles (and in some cases cc rewards) by1. click through heymax to spend using cc on some partner website/app (similar to shopback)2. public transport using linked visa during promo period3. buy vouchers on heymax4. get 2 max miles per $ using linked chocolate card5. referral and credit card sign up promo,btohqsg
Thanks for the elaboration.So means if I just go to the shop buy stuff and use paynwave can't earn miles  if I use other kind of CC üò¢,btohqsg
This is a much better offer.,btohqsg
Good morning :) not sure if it is appropriate to ask here : if I have $100k fixed deposited  maturing. Any advise where I can park the funds to genearate best yield?,btohqsg
See if any of these cash strategy options fithttps://youtu.be/ZwFCY0fZ64w?si=KkMEKizme2pL13Qx,btohqsg
Hello  this is probably a well-discussed topic but I'm trying to get some clarity.Is Poems a better platform than Endowus for SRS and CPF? Looking to buy into indices like MSCI World or US Prime. Sounds like Amundi is the choice fund. I used IWDA previously.- Endowus: 0.4% for SRS and CPF- Poems = 0%?,btohqsg
If I want to reset OCBC 360  where is the best place to park 100k for a month before putting back to OCBC 360?,btohqsg
can i earn 4mpd buying grab vouchers from Shopback through Apple Pay using my CRMC+Amaze combo?,btohqsg
Is it once I start the resetting of OCBC 360  I have to keeping on transferring money in and out forever?,btohqsg
Up to you. For my own ocbc 360  I reset once year at ard 103k balance by transferring HSBC ega for 1 month. Then start ocbc 360 at 96k the next month and increase 500ish a month again.,btohqsg
Does it work if I were to transfer 100K back n forth between ocbc 360 and HSBC every other month?,btohqsg
U do that way so that u only need to reset once a year isit?,btohqsg
Yes. You can do every month if you want to. Im lazy üòÜ,btohqsg
depends on the interest u getting on both accounts. See if interest is higher if just keep in ocbc for a few month and do 500 increment monthly,btohqsg
"Keyword is ""up to"" but the maximum interest rate you can get with 150k is 4%",btohqsg
will i get 4mpd by buying ecapitavoucher on the app using amaze + crmc,btohqsg
Better buy from wogi and redeem capita voucher.,btohqsg
Understand how u feel boon  but it's not a worthwhile investment. Even whole life plans  if u buy for the purpose of cashing out in the future  I rather u buy a term life and invest your money elsewhere. U put in REITs 20years still make more vs u pay for 20years. Don't forget what they show you are the illustrated performance  you can never 100% guarantee if it will under or over perform the projected earnings.,btohqsg
Anyone has their UOB Lunar New Year Pot of Gold Feb 2025 earmarked?,btohqsg

I previously signed up for Citi premier miles for the sign up bonus. Just reached the required spending and don't intend to use it for my daily use. Will there be any min monthly charges to the card even if I don't use it at all?,btohqsg
"I noticed the airwrap is ""for her"" but I supposed male applicant also can choose airwrap? Any difference between applying through this link vs singsaver directly? Thank you!",btohqsg
may i ask how many times can we participate for this?,btohqsg
May I check  HSBC live+ need to have $600 transactions posted by calendar month?,btohqsg
You can participate once per eligible account per promotion period,btohqsg
Yes  only amount posted within the calendar month will be counted for that month,btohqsg
Can choose either.Click through the links supports this channel.Click through SingSaver is the same deal anyway,btohqsg
Did everyone on heymax receive this email? üôÉ,btohqsg
Yes. It is based on calendar month for 3 months  yearly quarters. ie Jan to Mar  Apr to Jun.I got confirmation from CSO that the bank counts spending. So if we get rebate in Nov  that month we spend min $600 is still fine. No need to spend min $600 + rebate.,btohqsg
Hello all. How long does it take usually for citibank to confirm a transaction from pending state? Asking because i hope it gets to my current statement month and not the next.,btohqsg
It depends on merchant  not citibank.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how auto conversion work in IBKR? Can I buy US stock if I have SGD cash? Can I receive SGD automatically from USD dividend? I assume only cash account not margin account.,btohqsg
