I do. Both phone and app responded not eligible for fee waiver,btohqsg
SCB i dunno.But DBS Wwmc refused to waive after applying online 2x. So i called to cancel and they asked : ‚Äúwhy u cancelling sir?‚Äù  üò†Then they said okok waive.,btohqsg
Cancelled my SC Journey earlier due to no waiver.Only SC Smart doesn't have the annual fee waiver problem since it is ZERO annual fees.Which reminds me  S$500 cashback for new to SCB cardholders for SCB smart and Simplycash!https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/198468,btohqsg
