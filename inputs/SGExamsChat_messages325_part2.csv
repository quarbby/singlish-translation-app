How do you guys study for food (pure geog),btohqsg
hmmm i think one thing you can do is to check w the syllabus outline because it will streamline and highlight to you what are the most important things to study for food  and maybe you could stock a few real life cases up that’ll be good for ur OEQ but also help with your understanding esp since it happened in the real world,btohqsg
i think it’ll be good that you can differentiate direct vs indirect causes for reasons for growth and variations in food consumption,btohqsg
Oh same i got invited to some random group,btohqsg
n for food it’s quite common sense,btohqsg
Link it to things around u,btohqsg
