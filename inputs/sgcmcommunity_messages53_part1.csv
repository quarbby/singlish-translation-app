Technically yes but to the eyes of the gov no,btohqsg
Read before a news asking them to shut down their office,btohqsg
Wow i rather spend 3k more get a fd2r 😱,btohqsg
EV is the way to go,btohqsg
Sorry but based on NEA rules  one can idle for upto 5 minutes before facing a fine and I do think warming up an engine in the morning for engine health is good and in fact can result in a smoother running engine that burns more fuel and gives off less unburnt fuel out the exhaust,btohqsg
Anything that is not factory fitted is illegal,btohqsg
Are you Mr Pete's long lost sibling?,btohqsg
I only have 1:16 lambo collections,btohqsg
There's a few in sgcarmart around 17-18k .,btohqsg
Depends from engine to engine  some really need to be taken care of and warmed up  but I do believe that you can get by if you just wait for your idle revs to come down and drive off slowly  don't have to wait for it to climb completely upto temperature all the time.,btohqsg
Fd2 still can hold its value 😏,btohqsg
tbh everyth legal if u dont get caught,btohqsg
uh then akra bastuck eisenmann all not made by manufacturer but legal,btohqsg
Go by left but dun get caught 😂,btohqsg
but as the saying goes  STOCK IS BEST,btohqsg
Police gave lta and cisco the authority 😂,btohqsg
Sometimes LTA can be a bit annoying,btohqsg
I know a few people running bone stock  still have been stopped by LTA for on site inspection,btohqsg
Not loud cars as well  regular 4 cyl sedans,btohqsg
Just stock car and do a stock tune up can liao,btohqsg
5 mins overkill heh. 1 min I think okI really dont think there is a need for idle warm up. You can warm up your car by moving slowly on gear 1 as well; slowly take off.I do note that warming up is a thing in winter climate,btohqsg
1 minute good enough for revs to come down,btohqsg
Now grab waiting time only 3 mins LMAO,btohqsg
For newer cars  once you shift into gear  it forces the revs down and disrupts to warm up cycle as@jerrycxwmentioned,btohqsg
But yes  can wait for revs to come down  then just drive out slowly,btohqsg
Old cars have choke that will make initial start up rev a little higer.,btohqsg

I am Direct Buyer looking for Direct Owner to buy a Honda Fit with 3 years or less. Able to pay full amount. Looking for depreciation below 10 000 and well maintained car. Please PM if you are keen to let go of yours (:,btohqsg
Only one consignment car below 30k,btohqsg
Any amount that is below 30k,btohqsg
SG has 1. My SA called me to faster come down to the showroom to view when it was first brought in...,btohqsg
Nowadays 2k more dep still got so many ppl buy one 🥲,btohqsg
Two years ago only 7k dep per year,btohqsg
All don't apply to me lmao,btohqsg
Why are you limited to direct owner only though? Just curious,btohqsg
Also for direct owner  there may be some listings on other platforms that sort of rhyme with doorbell,btohqsg
Maybe want to avoid unnecessary fees,btohqsg
Can do so with dealers too  just that it's harder to negotiate if you secure your own insurance and pay in cash/secure own loan,btohqsg
