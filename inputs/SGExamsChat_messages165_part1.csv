Does any of em include me,btohqsg
YesDepends on the modules that you're takingBut  usually  we're just using the default format (for business report  it's slightly different). Moreover  at the end of report  we're supposed to put credits and/or references  which is the hardest to do in the report but it's a must to do so (I spent like quite a few months to understand the crediting/referencing format)And for crediting/referencing  the formats are fixed that you should follow either one of them  cannot anyhow crediting/referencingSo  if anyone here is wondering how to do so  feel free to pm me and I'll send you the notes,btohqsg
