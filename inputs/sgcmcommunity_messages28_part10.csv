I Think he got mental illnessDissociative identity disorder (DID) is a mental health condition. People with DID have two or more separate identities. These personalities control their behavior at different times. Each identity has its own personal history  traits  likes and dislikes.,btohqsg
We don't tolerate such behaviour in our Telegram Group,btohqsg
yeah sorry should‚Äôve ignored him earlier haha,btohqsg
shouldn't feed trolls lol... the more you answer  the more successful they feel,btohqsg
I think I might have already started ignoring him since a while ago,btohqsg
But got to admit.. It was the fastest way to get a troll removed. üëÄ,btohqsg
"let's see if he returns as ""Toyota""",btohqsg
We're watching but just tag us and if he or she deserves a straight red card  we will not hesitate to give it.,btohqsg
Imma go back to watch stranger things,btohqsg
He is still in other groups,btohqsg
VW cannot..  he will be leaking  here and there,btohqsg
Mazda wanted to do a luxury brand for American market. Amanti,btohqsg
Yes! Its raining in some parts of Singapore  so drive safe if you are heading out! And also  please ensure your tyres are not worn outüòä,btohqsg
Imma gonna start my journey to Korea and troll you guys from there,btohqsg

Very rich nowüòÇ from the SUV sales. They bought Mitsubishi Motors. Mazada Luxury brand may come soonüëçhttps://www.motor1.com/news/570272/mazda-luxury-brand-intentions/amp/,btohqsg
i think they will succeed. driving this car for nearly 6 months i can attest to it. mazda feels euro,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/JOL2Gb-eDW8Very good review. Many comments about buying it,btohqsg
it is taking the best of bits and pieces of german into the car while preserving the japanese reliability. just what i like,btohqsg
they should have a separate luxury brand. like Toyota got lexus ... ppl buy luxury brand.. brand must= luxury. even if they are lousy,btohqsg
Benz can come out with lousy cars but ppl still buy . cos the brand is more exp than the car itself,btohqsg
i dont think mazda has the resources and financial wherewithal to do a premium brand like infiniti lexus equivalents. they are just trying to sell more of their mass markets.,btohqsg
mazda is a real small company,btohqsg
they failed in malaysia in the past and now doing better as more are not beginning to accept the brand,btohqsg
collab with toyota to revive the rotary sports car,btohqsg
Mazda should just stay mass market n cheap while making nice looking cars...if start going premium . no Chan buy cheap n nice looking cars liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
price wise it is at the low end.,btohqsg
mazda and toyota exchange tech. they are good buddies,btohqsg
Drove before the Mazda 3 definitely better drive than Altis üòÖ,btohqsg
that's a given. needless to say. no serious car maker would use cvt. it is only for budget and cost.,btohqsg
you see euro car makers dont use cvt,btohqsg
cvt is like rubber band. no more torque,btohqsg
CVT is like using rubber while makin love. no feel..üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Well..... FN2R is based on Honda Fit chassis üôà,btohqsg
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-dHeRJdrnI8Prius has torquePrius CVT gearbox is like ATF Gearbox? Confuse,btohqsg
"""Prius CVT gearbox is like ATF Gearbox?"" - impossible",btohqsg
steel belt improved but impossible to have similar feel as box with gears,btohqsg
I did my financial review this week. My FA says I need networth of 1.7 Million SGD to retire at 1.5K monthly from age 65  with inflation accounted for.,btohqsg
my night was as beautiful as you üòò,btohqsg
say u r 30now. every year u need save about 50k...,btohqsg
No need  just need tesla stock to go to the moon,btohqsg
And all FA will tell you that because they earn commission from your investment with them,btohqsg
Seems like a standard way of pitching. Different agents quote me different amount but all in the millions,btohqsg
