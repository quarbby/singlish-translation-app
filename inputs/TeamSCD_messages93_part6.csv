then if lta comr check yr car u need to have all the certificate n stuff in ur car saying yr mods r legal ah,btohqsg
open bonnet and see under carriage,btohqsg
well as long u get yr mods legally nth fear,btohqsg
whats yr recc garage to mod car,btohqsg
if they have reason to believe you have illegal mod  they still can call you to inspection,btohqsg
It depends on ur car uses what brands of mods. What what brands you want to go for,btohqsg
try to find a good workshop and stick to it,btohqsg
Your 33s is done up at garage R?,btohqsg
i nv went back to them haha,btohqsg
then your 33s go where mod now?,btohqsg
Till now I've nv seen your 33s before sia,btohqsg
it's not in my hands liao,btohqsg
i got enough legs for 1 car only haha,btohqsg
Now it looks like that ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
i was planning on Regas too. but in silver,btohqsg
the new owner and my thoughts almost same haha,btohqsg
the blue on the car is very nice too,btohqsg
i wanna get jap rims for my bmw but the current rims would be wasted.,btohqsg
if it's stock  i still dont mind to change.,btohqsg
must thank the ex owner haha,btohqsg
otherwise i'll aim advan rg II,btohqsg
I also very gian to buy 1,btohqsg
good size. got a lot of options,btohqsg
should update from your te37 style ðŸŒš,btohqsg
But now advans also very common,btohqsg
Many reps coming out with advans,btohqsg
the flat face looks better than the concave design,btohqsg
In sg i see the te37 on 2007 vios  in melaka i see it on rusty proton saga,btohqsg
How do you guys define reps? Not the original owner of the design but produces it = rep?,btohqsg
TE37 not from rays = rep lo,btohqsg
It's like boobs  both same size but one is silicon ðŸ˜‚ look same feel different,btohqsg
Interesting cause a lot of brands come up with same design,btohqsg
So all are reps except for the original design,btohqsg
these other brands probably just reverse engineer it from the original,btohqsg
Mine like not concave not flat,btohqsg
less effort on their part thus can sell cheaper,btohqsg
mine also rep... save the money for other mods better haha,btohqsg
Mine lucky came with the car,btohqsg
Honestly u buy 1 set of rep = 1 pc of ori,btohqsg
But the rep must have recognitions ma,btohqsg
Rota also another VIA JWL certified,btohqsg
Maybe Iâ€™m cheap but if the construction quality is the same with accreditations itâ€™s good enough imo,btohqsg
I think as long as it's a known brand of reps,btohqsg
Oh and as long as they donâ€™t brand it as the originals,btohqsg
Mine when got the car I didn't know anything about ce28. Only after I got it then I found out how lucky I was. Would have been nice if the number plate also came along. But well...,btohqsg
I honestly question how much effort went into that design of 6 rectangular spokes,btohqsg
Probably the impressive part is the weight which they economized the material required to deliver the load limit,btohqsg
it's nice until it was overused. but then  overused because it's nice.,btohqsg
i think it's a very versatile design since it's quite simply,btohqsg
Sounds like the H belt that every insurance agent wears,btohqsg
