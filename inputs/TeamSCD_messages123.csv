I managed to tune it to work with the Motorola,btohqsg
Dunno..always been a Motorola man when comes to walkies,btohqsg
And also with another china one,btohqsg
Good for convoy esp overseas trips,btohqsg
But there's no way to tune the Motorola,btohqsg
Used to go for overseas convoy quite often,btohqsg
Then when I think Abt it  go jb my mother and my sis both no roaming  better to give them one,btohqsg
Keep the convoy intact n safe is top priority,btohqsg
Leave no men or car behind at all costüòÇ,btohqsg
Same like just now go to Dempsey put one in friend car still can communicate,btohqsg
If not like boring just drive behind no passenger,btohqsg
I always the last car behind each convoy...do the keeping every car intact duty,btohqsg
Help to block out rear traffic if front cars have issues keep up,btohqsg
Use walkie feel like in a topgear video,btohqsg
Wa u racer and can drive long hour,btohqsg
The faster he drive the more awake he is,btohqsg
Lolx....not racer..that why always the last car leh,btohqsg
If racer then is leading car liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
Other car too slow. U have toPush them from behind,btohqsg
Lolx..keeping each single car In the convoy intact n safeüòÅ,btohqsg
Have to la..or else...all over the place..rabak leh...got veterans n newbies from all ages ..like 20plus all the way to 50s,btohqsg
Soon we will kick the bucket,btohqsg
And not all r used to going in formation of 20 or more cars,btohqsg
Overseas convoy not as simple as it is,btohqsg
Did a few recovery of lost cars before back then n lead them back to the FUP area,btohqsg
Before we uncle's kick the bucket,btohqsg
Similar duty as a infantry CSM duty,btohqsg
Convoy discipline very important de la,btohqsg
His setup is wad I did like 6yrs ago,btohqsg
I hope his idling is stable,btohqsg
If he not on standalone ECU management....very fast go into car ICU one,btohqsg
I really hope his workshop know wad they are handling when comes to hardware and ecu support,btohqsg
Next time open workshop must ask tiger for partnership,btohqsg
If he on stock Conrod...pistons and exhaust n intake valve rating...oso very de good lucküòÇ,btohqsg
That air Intake manifold need some work done to it before installing...that 8 m not sure if he know anot..plus the intake gasket..have to be non silicone based,btohqsg
Looks good n have bragging rightsüòÇ,btohqsg
His car Sld be good. One year alr. He didn‚Äôt post. Mean still alright,btohqsg
Without a standalone ECU......the hardwares can't be fully unleash potiental,btohqsg
U can go his Instagram see.,btohqsg
Lolx...u think ppl will post the nasty things that comes with it,btohqsg
Correct Instagram or not... I click see birds,btohqsg
Of coz ppl will post the bragging rights stuff mah,btohqsg
Never seen any posts abt the car got issues in there before,btohqsg
I got post me jump starting mine,btohqsg
He post his upgrade. But bad stuff hardly haha,btohqsg
Unless wan flame the ws or brands,btohqsg
Anyway....if not on a stable standalone ECU management system...Bo eng,btohqsg
Plus he did not mentioned his injector cc and running on wad type of fuel railing,btohqsg
There are many things not mentioned...that why I reserved my commentsüòÅ,btohqsg
Best just to see n clap hands,btohqsg
Yup didn‚Äôt. I only see the fancy side lol,btohqsg
It is always been the small details that matters,btohqsg
Based on pics....I dun really have any comments or insights,btohqsg
He using bcv1 but change spring.,btohqsg
Surprise he haven‚Äôt tune after so many change,btohqsg
Lolx...this I know more abt wad gonna happen,btohqsg
Stand by new dampers n struts,btohqsg
It is the same logic as using lowering springs n stock dampers logic,btohqsg
U strengthen the spring ratings..but the dampers can't support,btohqsg
Then end result is...faster wear n tear,btohqsg
Anything oso can goes...pockets deep can liaoüòÅ,btohqsg
Ppl use 3yrs..u use 1yr luh,btohqsg
Can use is can use..but how long nia,btohqsg
Handling is not as simple as just change the springs,btohqsg
Must see dampers can tahan anot,btohqsg
Agree. Spoil just change back same item lo,btohqsg
N coilovers alone ain't the end of handling upgrades...it is just the start,btohqsg
Alot of ppl misunderstand abt this point,btohqsg
That why need ur advice haha,btohqsg
Lolx..no la..I m just a novice,btohqsg
Haha. Good that u open up and shave,btohqsg
Mine are all blood n tears eperiences,btohqsg
I think I go for outlook best,btohqsg
Like how I kanna for my old car haha,btohqsg
I based on my own experiences,btohqsg
Local roads..keep a look out for speed limitsüòÇ,btohqsg
Not really into street racing in general esp locallyüòÇ,btohqsg
The price to pay is extremely high,btohqsg
In army I also convoy. 5 tonner,btohqsg
Wan to prove a point..take it to bolehland track...can be sepang or mimc or so on,btohqsg
Not really understand the backfire...popping n flames thing either,btohqsg
Maybe it is the age thingüòÇ,btohqsg
Starting I think quite nice. But after awhile. Very noisy lol,btohqsg
I m a straight talkerPardon my straightforward or tackless natureüôè,btohqsg
Lolx...that I dun think many know,btohqsg
Some dun even know how to keep within the lines on expresswaysüòÇ,btohqsg
That why until now I didn‚Äôt touch engine,btohqsg
China fit/jazz not 100% same in diamensions as Thai/Japan ones,btohqsg
