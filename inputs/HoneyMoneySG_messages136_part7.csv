hi guys  would like to check 2 things:is the best combination for my CC (citibank cashback) to earn most cash back would be instarem amaze?what is the best CC for ride hailing apps? (grab  tada  gojek  cdg),btohqsg
no need pair citibank cashback card with Amaze for local spend.yuu card for gojek 18% or 10mpd,btohqsg
but local spending alr 1k+ then rebate only $2+.. i dont understand,btohqsg
Hi team  for people who use CardUp  please take note.I did not receive any emails warning me of this change and I have Mortgage payments scheduled till December.Please look at your CardUp setups to avoid late fees etc,btohqsg
you get 0.2% first  bonus cashback for specific categories only come in after statement month,btohqsg
Cardup is excluding visa for loan payments. Now the advantage for UOB prvi visa and dbs vantage (and ocbc 90n) are losing.,btohqsg
ahhh i see..  no wonder the cash back so less 😅😅,btohqsg
hi guys if i already have a citi credit card  what is the best website or app that gives the best signup reward if i am applying for another one?,btohqsg
@HMSGHiveand see if there are any recent existing customers offer.,btohqsg
For the twitch  antivirus n telco will just add on to the spending tier which is spend 500  1k or 2k to get 3.33% cashbackIf your telco is SingTel  better use Yuu Card and get up to either 38% rebate or 10 mpdIf your telco is M1 or StarHub  see trust app have offer anot,btohqsg
The 18% rebate or 10 mpd comes with a catch so need to be careful,btohqsg
iPayMy works for mortgage payments setup and I input a stream till December 2025 using the Vantage card (Visa).It is however more expensive at 1.85% + $1 (CardUp was 1.75%) and I found that my miles cost increased from $0.011 to $0.012 😔That being said  it still allows me to earn ~90k miles per year with free hotel stay plus annual fee waiver for the Vantage.YMMV but iPayMy is the current replacement for CardUp for loans.,btohqsg
PSA: grab $80 gift for Citi payall is in. Citi prestige banzai!!,btohqsg
how about the cm link ?,btohqsg
Can the free 1 night hotel stay come from 2 membership years n combine into 2 consecutive nights ? Eg. Last day of membership year plus first day of next membership year.,btohqsg
Good question. I am guessing cannot as there is usually a lag time before they send you a new code for the Accor Plus renewal after the annual fees waiver and the one from last year will lapse already if not used within membership year.,btohqsg
The concern is that these two closely mirrors each others actions,btohqsg
Can I use amaze + Citi rewards for hospital payment? Will I get the miles?,btohqsg
1 question  should I link my trust  cash back card to my ntuc app instead of the orginal trust card? Better returns?,btohqsg
Is visa side so soon la.,btohqsg

Hi guys. For the time being  I would probably max out my 1k on both uob platinum visa and amaze + citirewards.What do you all recommend I use for dining and general stuff like grocery? I also have uob lady solitaire but I heard it can't be pair with amaze now?,btohqsg
Can use the UOB lady sol by itself. Not need amaze.,btohqsg
Is it better than other cards?,btohqsg
Better is subjective to your spending pattern.,btohqsg
Hi All  just wanted to check for yearly insurance premium with uob priv miles visa card. Cardup or ipaymy will be better in terms of % rate,btohqsg
edit: ipaymy excluded in the TnC of uob prvi,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
but just confirm if the recurring will be better for this card services or yearly to gain the most out of it,btohqsg
To be clear  it's totally fine to stop at L3 (which is what I'm doing now),btohqsg
😔 SAD: CardUp will no longer accept VISA or UnionPay for loan repayments starting from 1 Nov 2024.🔗 CardUp Code:HONEYMONEYSign up here:https://app.cardup.co/users/sign_up📝 Important to note:* Mastercard is still accepted for loan repayments (for now).* ipaymy still accepts VISA for loan repayments (for now).🔗 ipaymy link:https://hmsg.link/ipaymyUse code:HONEYMONEYSG💡 If you're using DBS Vantage or Maybank Platinum VISA  now might be a good time to switch to ipaymy or use a Mastercard with CardUp instead.📢 Mastercard Promo Codes with CardUp:Refer here:https://t.me/HMSGHive/2042🔄 Recurring Payments (card rewards guaranteed):💳 1.8% fee with code MCREC18💳 UOB PRVI MasterCardhttps://hmsg.link/prvimc💳 OCBC 90N Mastercardhttps://hmsg.link/ocbc90nmc💳 Citi PremierMileshttps://hmsg.link/premiermiles💳 Citi Prestigehttps://hmsg.link/citiprestige💬 Not happy with the change?👉 Discuss more:https://t.me/honeymoneysg👉 More referral codes:https://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg

trust link and trust cashback whats the difference?,btohqsg
Go find videos on Citibank credit cards by Chris. For a start  if you have Citibank rewards and premier Mastercard with amaze  these 2 cards can cover almost all of your spending.,btohqsg
Is this the video to watch? Haha,btohqsg
One is dual credit+ debit card  the other is cashback credit card.,btohqsg
One is high linkpoints reward debit/credit card  another is low cashback card,btohqsg
Does this affect monthly income tax payment paid with dbs altitude card?😅,btohqsg
