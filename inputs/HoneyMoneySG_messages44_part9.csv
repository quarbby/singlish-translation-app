oh! I see it makes so much sense rn,btohqsg
so I need one of my other household memebrs to create another acc so we can alternate the funds via both accs every month rite,btohqsg
correct  but you also need another bank to be the middle man account.. ideally that should be a joint account to avoid triggering Anti Money Laundering checks.,btohqsg
"so if we do this  this is considered ""fresh funds"" rite?",btohqsg
yes.. that's the point of the middle man joint account,btohqsg
"oh! makes sense  what is your ""middle man joint acc"" bank you're using tho",btohqsg
For my household  because we were lucky enough to be on the 3.8%p.a. Esaver exclusive invite  we use that. It can be used to store the balances across holidays and Sundays if crossing month-end.But any third party bank will also work. Just remember my tip on making sure it is a joint account that matches with your HSBC A and HSBC B account. This is the most important.,btohqsg
"what do you mean by ""match"" tho? haha sorry am still new to the strategy for HSBC EGA",btohqsg
HSBC A = HusbandHSBC B = WifeSCB Joint = Husband/Wife Joint,btohqsg
ohh okayy! thanks so much  so basically everytime at the very end of the month you do this?,btohqsg
if I'm utilising HSBC EGA promo yes,btohqsg

Did anyone receive a similar email from Whizcomm? Is there any legal action we can take against them?,btohqsg
🙏 appreciate it bro  are you utilizing any other promos at the moment?,btohqsg
Hi  sorry just for my understanding  it can be HSBC A> external account > HSBC A right?,btohqsg
what is the point of doing this?,btohqsg
UOB One at 5% p.a. is also very good.,btohqsg
It's just for moving the cash out in the middle month (adb becomes $2k/$5k) right?,btohqsg
Why do I need both HSBC A and HSBC B?,btohqsg
i'm also new to this hsbc ega promo. just try to understand.if i hv 100k and dun hv other spare cash  i will just stay with uob one  bcoz 5% p.a. is quite good le...but if i hv spare cash (other than the 100k)  i can apply for hsbc ega  n shift money into hsbc ega... is this correct?,btohqsg
Should be either1) HSBC A and HSBC B2) HSBC A and 1 external account (eg. Esaver)No?,btohqsg
The aim is to earn 5.x% p.a. with HSBC EGA at all times.,btohqsg
if you have EXACTLY $100k  then probably yes to just having UOB One.If you have $60k? Ditch UOB One.. for HSBC EGAs$150k? $100k in UOB One  $50k in HSBC EGAs.,btohqsg
if i wanna make use of the next uob ang bao promo  maybe i need to move funds out of uob one to hsbc ega  nearer the year end or so... this is assuming that i dont have another pax to create another uob one acct (back to the qn i asked this morning). is this correct?,btohqsg
"that is so far away... but i'm betting uob will have another ""ang bao"" promo on 1st july 2023  referencing 30th June day end balance.. BUT THIS IS PURELY MY GUESS.",btohqsg
ohhh.. so u r referring to the 30 june one... ok  noted  and thks so much for the kind explanation and patience! much appreciated! 😄,btohqsg
"Can also be. from what i understand  the point is to ""merry go round"" so that both HSBC EGA accounts can earn the ""peak interest""",btohqsg
Can musical chair as below?Month 1:HSBC acct of person AMonth 2:UOB one acct of person AMonth 3:HSBC acct of person A?,btohqsg
that won't maximise hsbc ega 5.x% p.a. interest since Month 2 you only getting UOB One rates.,btohqsg
Oh I gets this is just for transferring la. Not for storing,btohqsg
If have $100k Month 1 in HSBC : 5.45%Month 2 in UOB : 5%Month 3 in HSBC : 5.45%Is it higher interest ?,btohqsg
Wow City square giving 3 pieces of shell vouchers when u go redeem their free weekday parking promo.,btohqsg
weekday parking promo = first xxx to spend $30 and go customer service with receipts,btohqsg
If keep all in HSBC Only earn 5.45% in month 1Month 2 & 3 earn 4.45%.Correct?,btohqsg
that is why need HSBC A and HSBC B and outside A/B,btohqsg
Month 1/2/3 all earn 5.xx% p.a. I won't assume 5.45% since the promo lock in rate changes monthly.,btohqsg
If only have 1 person  what is the best strategy?,btohqsg
maybe as per what u outlined loh.but go find another trusted human la.. it is so much more useful for playing all these games.,btohqsg
ega 4.x% bonus interest for 4 months or alternate ega and uob one like u mentioned,btohqsg
btw jus curious  why 4 monthly cycles? after 4 months the promo no more?,btohqsg
bonus interest promo is for 4 months window  then need to empty out on 5th month  and can start the new cycle from 6th month,btohqsg
after 4 months  you have to register again  and be subject to the mercy of whatever is the rate then.,btohqsg
technically if you only one human  you have a 5 month window (you need month 5 to be a minimal balance account). Then month 6 first day u can SMS in and month 5 will be the reference month.,btohqsg
oo sheesh  where did they write bout this 4 months cycle thonever see on their website sia haha,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if kris+ via applepay consider online transaction for DBS womans 10x dbs points?,btohqsg

might be bcos u have a hsbc cc?,btohqsg
