spend some time to read on the educational advantages provided to minorities ( blacks for usa  aboriginal for australia  non-han for china)  and then compare it to singapore. I personally think its bullshit and bad to have these provided  but its one side of the coin. you can take a look at that and decide for yourself,btohqsg
Anyone here in NTU sociology ?,btohqsg
"looking back in the chat history  quite a few ppl here simply say ""sg is meritocratic"" and then don't go further to think about what that actually means  and whether it's good or bad. just food for thought along with mooncake :)",btohqsg
Meritocracy in trying to isolate merit by treating ppl w fundamentally unequal bg as the same ignores and masks real adv and disav of diff segments of peopleâ€¦ those w benefits alr had an adv and thus were further rewarded by meritocracy,btohqsg
If you need I can connect socio students with you,btohqsg
adding on to that with real examples  singapore believes that your race  gender  sexuality  and all hibbie jibbie stuff does not affect your performance (whereas other countries believe that being discriminated stunts your performance  hence they compensate it). An example would be china literally gives out extra grades to minorities for gaokao. Singapore does the complete opposite  throws everything out the window  and only stare at your grades. Singapore doesnt care if you are white  pink   blue  red  purple  brown  or identify as a fire fox. Both sides has its merits and grounds for consideration,btohqsg
"@tingfrogmaybe that would explain why meritocracy is thrown around like a ""good"" buzz word  but it is not essentially a good thing  depending on which part of the fence you are on",btohqsg
Yes please sir esp if they took HS2008 mod,btohqsg
one of my friends is NTU socio i can ask if he took it.,btohqsg
Hi  j wna ask if its legal for a company to dismiss u earlier than ur shift's end time on a working day but not honour the salary of the stated shift timings,btohqsg
As in for eg if ur scheduled to work till 5pm  supervisor realises they dn u for the day anym cos theres nth to do so they ask u to leave at 2pm. Is it allowed that they pay u up till 2pm or shld they pay u till 5pm?,btohqsg
Consider this in the circumstance that nth was stated in the contract regarding working hours that can be altered subject to discretion of higher ups,btohqsg
if your contract did not state any minimum daily working hours and no daily pay but only hourly pay there's nothing much you can do.,btohqsg
"need to see the contract  but agree with@TanJunWei. Employment Act s.9(1): ""A contract of service for a specified piece of work or for a specified period of time ... terminates when the work specified in the contract is completed""",btohqsg
do you have a contract about working hours?,btohqsg
the contract only stated minimum hours per week. but a week before  everyone's hours are rostered and fixed. unfortunately the manager likes to send ppl home 2-3h early frequently,btohqsg
despite it being disrespectful of my time  i j want to know if legal action can be taken ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
its been a few months but i just need to clarify,btohqsg
it js said minimum 22 hours a week,btohqsg
dont think so  it can be considered a breach of contract at the most  and not of termination,btohqsg
can anything be done abt breach of contract?,btohqsg
and the hours im rostered for added up to arnd 35h a week,btohqsg
so with all the deductions it definitely still passed the 22h limit,btohqsg
probably have to view in context of singapore employment law  but in this case at the very most that you are compensated for the hours you were supposed to do; which would be pretty ridiculous to go to court to. i think its best you speak to your employer,btohqsg
and in this case no  they have met their contractual obligation,btohqsg
this is abt all the closure i need,btohqsg
honestly it didnt affect me that much and anw disrespect is impossible to fight for in court,btohqsg
and in the case i do get compensation  legal fees would exceed anyw so thanks for the clarifications everyone,btohqsg
use the legendary forbidden technique passed down from NS called lan lan suck thumb,btohqsg
Suck for 5 months alr. My thumb pain how?,btohqsg
suck thumb about pain sucking thumb  recurse it for all problems,btohqsg
welcome to the working world ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg

dw to get tangled up in bs js cos of an ugly hearted manager,btohqsg
