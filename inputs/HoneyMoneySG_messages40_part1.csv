Plus fuel is like 25% discount....Just wanted to hear from people in the group. In case I am missing something,btohqsg
Ive a family with kids and car. So I end up spending decent amount on groceries and eating out and fuel every month....,btohqsg

Hi  I‚Äôm planning to apply for the CIMB credit card (either CIMB World Mastercard or CIMB Visa Signature Card). The purpose is to get the sign up reward which I‚Äôm planning to top up NTUC gift card value to hit the min spend for the reward.Would like to seek recommendation which CIMB card should I go for? (CIMB cc is not to be my main card  fyi),btohqsg
hello@ChrisHMSGi want to engage in a health debate with u.For all 3 benefits you mentioned in the video I disagree (for myself and the folks who are in a similar situation)  where I think the cash being put into CPF top-ups to hit FRS is an opportunity cost where it could have been in better yielding investments over a long term horizon (e.g. SPX  QQQ etc.).It's true that CPF offers a risk-free 4% rate on the retirement accnt  but for people invested over the long haul (e.g. myself im remaining invested over the next 19 yrs in the markets)  that's alot of missed opportunity cost and time value of money.,btohqsg
not that u're wrong  but for folks who want a very solid foundation with FRS fully paid up and a guaranteed 4% base layer  that's all good,btohqsg
No problem  there is no debate here. I agree those who are good at investing should focus fire in what they are good in.,btohqsg
Topping up FRS is good for those people who have zero knowledge on investment. there are little to none investment products can earn 4% pa without burning their fingers. furthermore  i would rather throw the money to my own CPF than paying the income tax.,btohqsg
For DBS women card  uob lady card and OCBC titanium  can I redeem the points / miles earned into cash rebate like Citi rewards?,btohqsg
For UOB ACB annual fee  is it worth it to pay? or just cancel it if you can't get the annual fee waived.,btohqsg
I would just cancel if fees are not waived as there is no much use cases now given the grab nerf,btohqsg
yeah. Im thinking of the cashback. seems like it wont even break even if I pay,btohqsg
How to use my amex cashback card  to pay hsbc insurance which is below 300 dollars?,btohqsg
For SC eSaver  I can close the account after end of May right? I will still get 3.8% p.a for the 2 months right?,btohqsg
i have to say i absolutely agree with this,btohqsg
Believe hsbc life can only paynow or giro. No card payment.,btohqsg
U cannot close the account within 6 months. Else 30$ penalty. Min 1k balance for the rest 4 months.,btohqsg
