Haha u are playing with fire here. Depends on what do u mean by the terms Singapore if u just meant the administration which controlled Singapore with your snarky comments on the 1/2 cent which was issued by the straits settlements and later Malaya then I would also have u know there was even a 2 1/2 cent coin and even a 2 cent coin following the administration of the British Empire in indirect or direct rule as a colony. The 2 cent is slightly anachronistic as it was issue and minted in for use in the Caribbeans but the 2 1/2 cent coin was issued and minted for the State of North Borneo  both of which are protectorates of the British Empire at that time and would be part of Malaya.,btohqsg

I am fucking serious u little shit. U are about to get a fucking intro into Currency even if u don't like it  both coins are typical of the British empire and its rapid industrialisation and spread  but they are different in that the materials for both differed one being made of Bronze and the other made of the more familiar Cupronickel.This was due to new methods of production which made alloys more cost efficient to work with and mint. Cupronickel is very durable and provides a luster and shine even when heavily tarnished  this is in contrast to the Bronze coins which often oxidised and coated the coin in a rusty layer.,btohqsg

i thought i was gonna get a intro of how the 1/2 cent came about not the materials coins are made from,btohqsg
arent a b and c the same just different sequence,btohqsg
Oh the coins production is interesting as well. The Bronze coin 1/2 cent was mainly made in Tower Hill Mint. Often it was the only mint who could handle the mass economies of scale required for the fabrication and mintage of the planchets and the press from a die. This was not the case for the 2 1/2 cent coin which was minted in Birmingham clearly reflective of the rapid industrialisation and growth of the British empire.,btohqsg
oh is it supposed to draw out the structure left to right?,btohqsg

DEVELOPING: SCDF is battling a fire in the Eunos industrial area  near Geylang Serai market and several malls in Paya Lebar.Avoid the area:https://cna.asia/49fAttm,btohqsg
Speaking of fires it's interesting how fire suppression works.. granted the floor and building is fucked but it is contained to it for almost all modern day fires and in this case its just a rare case of it breaking at least 1 line of containment. Heck there is even a protocol for dispatch if I remember correctly 1-2 calls will bring like 2 fire engines,btohqsg
wtf gukesh is only 1 yr older than me,btohqsg
Idk about SCDF protocols but err the logistics is interesting I think the incident commander is universal in that the first battalion chief that reaches the scene is designated that first,btohqsg
