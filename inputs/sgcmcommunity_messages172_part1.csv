I wonder who is the leader,btohqsg
Just wanna ask the drivers here on this issue about road hoggingâ€¦Scenario:Car A is traveling on PIE lane 1 within speed limit of 90kph while lane 2 is relatively empty. Car B appears behind Car A with the intention to overtake. Car A refuses to budge and continues cruising on lane 1  preventing Car B from overtaking  with the mentality that he is not breaking any traffic rules and Car B should not be speeding above the speed limit.,btohqsg
Why can't Car B overtake via lane 2 then?,btohqsg
That would be undertaking  which means breaking traffic rules,btohqsg
I know this has been debated since the beginning of time,btohqsg
Scenario will be different if lane 2 is Occupied,btohqsg
Right most lane is for over taking  meaning after over taking  should go back to middle lane. Many drivers just plain ignorant or inconsiderate,btohqsg
Yes but still Car A can proceed further till there is an opening to filter,btohqsg
Precisely. Many assume they can travel at speed limit on lane 1 all the way from Changi to Tuas,btohqsg
So speeding or not or under 90 or not is not the issue here  its whether the fella is done overtaking  if yes should f off the right lane ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
If I am Car B  I will just use Lane 2 to overtake,btohqsg
I know Car A has not broken any traffic rules but it is more of common road courtesy,btohqsg
Since Car A is so called road hogging....hahaha,btohqsg
I do that sometimes when the ignorant driver in front refuses to budge,btohqsg
So why must tailgate Car A then,btohqsg
Car B will never be at fault as long as car A is road hogging,btohqsg
We see many of such scenarios daily.,btohqsg
U can always use lane 2 to drive all the way further up......hahahahaha...then once far enough  use lane 1 lahhhhh,btohqsg
