use contactless/mobile contactless cards like uob ppv  uob VS,btohqsg

Hola I am new to the world of credit cards and seeking a recommendation for my first card. I prefer a card with no annual fees and no minimum spend requirement to start. Here are my regular expenses:1. Netflix: Currently using my debit card.2. Lunch and Dinner: Paying with DBS PayLah or PayNow at food courts and hawker centers.3. Travel: Using my Visa debit card for tickets. Frequency: 3 to 4 times a year. Fare is approx S$800-900 per trip.4. Zara Shopping: Buying clothes at Orchard with my debit card or occasionally PayNow.5. Apple Gadgets: Purchasing them every 2 to 3 months.6. Bars: Paying at bars with my debit card weekly.7. Groceries: Shopping at Giant or FP using PayNow  PayLah  or debit card.8. I need to pay my Tax as well9. Room rent: my house rental is S$950 and I use PayNow for that10. Gym fees : PayNowI also plan to buy the iPhone 14 next week. Could you please recommend the best credit card for me? Additionally  I would appreciate any cashback offers for initial expenses within the first month of having the card.Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your reply.,btohqsg
I see. Thanks. So $1500 cap per month. So if I buy a laptop worth $1500 from Shopee using UOB ONE card  I can stop using this card for the rest of statement month,btohqsg
HSBC revo has no annual fee and shd cover most of your spending. Tax and rent you might need still to pay by cash but if you search earlier message you should be able to find some tips on how to convert them to be eligible on credit cards,btohqsg
U need to hit $2000 per month for 3 months in a row. Also I think there is a minimum transaction count. 3 or 5 per month I forgot.,btohqsg
