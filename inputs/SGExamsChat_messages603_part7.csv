A level physics = you just need to practice enough because cambridge doesn't rly test enough novel qns yet where it would significantly cost you a grade,btohqsg
Errr I think thats just paper 2,btohqsg
Chem actually q repetitive one in the answer key is just that the qn they can make it funky,btohqsg
"problem is ""enough"" is a subjective word",btohqsg
TYS + all prelim papers for that yr,btohqsg
in our line  we have seen students being so upset that they studied super super hard but can't score.And their definition of super hard is the few days before exams they cram everything,btohqsg
This is alr inclusive of like tutorials and stuff if you actually like,btohqsg
For me doing tutorials was more or less enough for physics and chem,btohqsg
I gave up during my papers,btohqsg
in other words  consistency.Time spent consistently on the subject adds up,btohqsg
Consistency is probably the most important factor in doing well,btohqsg
I was a C for J1 promos.But because of Physics olympiad  I studied additional Physics all the way to university physics  which eventually brought my grades up,btohqsg
Real (me when I tell this to people but they don't believe me),btohqsg
even now i don't think i have the consistency i want lol,btohqsg
what is studying for olympiad like when its outside of syllabus?,btohqsg
I was wondering and regretting why I even decided to take it.Could bo chup it but that wasn't something I would do,btohqsg
Pure hist  elec geo and combined physics  poa,btohqsg
I'm just scared of my humanities and physics,btohqsg
if you take combined physics  don’t gotta worry about anything,btohqsg
I thought bio has more content but when I looked through the syllabus physics had more,btohqsg
i thought i would regret taking physics at the start of the year but when I look at the content for bio im glad i took physics,btohqsg
bio has 12 chapter while physics has 17,btohqsg
more chapters doesn’t really mean more content,btohqsg
and I barely passed my maths,btohqsg
Physics is not content-based more application,btohqsg
sec school physics don’t have much maths  you only just need to know like your graphs,btohqsg
But some people failed physics though,btohqsg
If they fail physics it’s most likely they don’t understand what they’re being taught or they just don’t study enough,btohqsg
I hope I can get at least a2,btohqsg
i think the first few chapters would be quite a challenge because i was failing physics for the whole of semester 1,btohqsg
but then when semester 2 came i got straight A1s,btohqsg
physics quite difficult to fail (unless you take pure physics),btohqsg
im interested cus want to go into semicon lol,btohqsg
I was in semiconductor.Olympiad knowledge not too much use. Just help do well in university physics and easier to apply for scholarships.,btohqsg
easy to pass. Tougher to score A1,btohqsg
I want to get at least a2 tho,btohqsg
combined not my area. Because chem included which I can't do,btohqsg
try to not fail overall in Sec 3,btohqsg
I have had a student who can do super well in combined physics but can't do the chem portionLucky she started from pure sciences  so my advice for her was not to drop to combined science but just ignore pure chem,btohqsg
do 1 question everyday can liao,btohqsg
recently the physics component felt tougher than the pure science tbh,btohqsg
Combined science in general quite easy,btohqsg
The difficulty jump from combined to pure is err,btohqsg
Shld be able to get A if you put on effort,btohqsg
Pure science requires more understanding of the concepts,btohqsg
but i saw someone said that combined phy is 75% of pure,btohqsg
I can find combined questions that may stump pure sci students from the O lvl paper,btohqsg
Coming from somebody who has done pure and combined science,btohqsg
My sec sch comb cher made chem interesting,btohqsg
And I did well for comb sci,btohqsg
