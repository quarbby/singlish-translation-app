I need to use trolley  confirm MPV order type. Plus took up entire boot at the back,btohqsg
I told them they should book car not motorcycles and they told me if I drive car can take and scold me in vulgarity cos I said want to contact llm to cancel,btohqsg
U can tell them to cancel if u cannot take . For my case I tell them and they scold me in vulgarity and chase me away . Really holigan act . And worst said we Singaporean all like that,btohqsg
I contact live chat and llm said will cancel . And I check the app is cancel by driver ?,btohqsg
This above lady super rude scold loins at me and said if I do not go off she will call police . ðŸ˜¡,btohqsg
I told her I just want to contact llm to solve the problem.,btohqsg
I wish we can feedback to LLM and they can ban these goons,btohqsg
Llm would ban them la . Customer also right,btohqsg
We only can help each other here to boycott this shop . Pagiflorist 625 Aljunied Road,btohqsg
They came here to earn money no problem but they bully Singaporean is not ok,btohqsg
i took job from them b4. no issues.,btohqsg
What job u take car or motorcycles? Item ? And who is the people u take from ?,btohqsg
was a car job. 4 locations. flower delivery. each location properly packed and labelled. told me which one was urgent.was a man. slightly plump. only one at the location.when i was collecting  got 2 more ppl come. both grab express.,btohqsg
For car ok cos 4 item flower need car . And the slightly plump guy is the guy scold me vulgarity as I told him that 3 item exceed the limit and he told me I can take cos I drive car and told me if the drive car should not take motorcycles job .,btohqsg
When something happen then you will know how bad is the guy and the lady attitude towards u . Really holigan act,btohqsg
so far i do delivery jobs. i never encountered issues with sender or recipient.not only for lalamove. grabexpress also.,btohqsg
Ok  remember: Pagiflorist 625 Aljunied RoadDon't take. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
not really lucky.got once or twice. sender or recipient MIA.then have to return back items,btohqsg
when doing lalamove  especially if u using car  if bid for motor jobs  dun expect sender to not take advantage especially during this period.,btohqsg
for me  i only bid if i really want the job. if not  i wait for better job or locations i wanna go to.,btohqsg
I understand if he apologise that he do not know it exceed the limit for motorcycles I ok but instill he blame me and scold me vulgarity said I Singaporean all like that . Which I think is not right .,btohqsg
ya. if he scold and shout vulgarities  then not right. better u report to lalamove.,btohqsg
Their attitude is really sucks .,btohqsg
A lot la book motor but bulky job. Not regulated by LLM n sheer thick skin...,btohqsg
Singaporeans are like that? They look down on us. We Singaporeans are more resilient than these goons.,btohqsg
Better not take. Could be entered address wrongly. Later ask you send jurong,btohqsg
Hi  may I know for car  need to buy the lalabag also? The announcement said mandatory.,btohqsg
Problem is  how they gonna see the bag when your driving? Put on the hood? Bonnet? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
It's about branding  so would be hitting the motorcycles first. More curious to know what kind of budget they are going to put into enforcement.,btohqsg
Ya. The announcement didn't specify whether only bikes or all vehicles,btohqsg
Most likely will be bikes  then follow cars.. Like stickers wise.. Subsequently will be  maybe  uniform.. Like@Bobby2002mentioned  branding. Following like foodpanda  grab etc.,btohqsg
If number cannot call thru  persist with live chat until got reply. Tell them customer number cannot get thru,btohqsg
