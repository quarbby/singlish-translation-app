We don't even have the reasonably spec Pronton X50 and X70  Ora good car etc .Our car market is shamefully over priced with under spec cars.Rationally we all know that it is to keep the traffic less congested for our National economy.But emotionally.....inside the heart of many ...... cannot find  a word to describe.,btohqsg
Worth to get a secondhand 2017 civic now with a depre of 13 500?,btohqsg
If not COE  I don’t wanna drive liao. Can’t imagine the jam,btohqsg
Got one civic fd 2009 going for <12k depre,btohqsg

18.5k depre tho.. but looks nice. Low mileage too sia,btohqsg
Ya  used to be 14-15k depre only. 🥲,btohqsg
if can wait wait. if cannot wait just swallow,btohqsg

Golden qns is how long to wait. Haha,btohqsg
Haha I seen u reply this at least 3 times,btohqsg
We all here waiting to strike toto also,btohqsg
I think we may actually need to wait till about2024-2025for COE to really drop,btohqsg
Gotta hit the time when the fleet of PHV expires,btohqsg
2024 another 1% gst . If recesssion take place full blown . Ah gong also needs to hit the kpi .coe might stay put or continue to grow,btohqsg

Mazda launches the MX-30 here at the 2023 Singapore Motor Show 🔥The all-electric Mazda MX-30  launched here in Singapore  should appeal to urbanites with its 224km range and compact exterior dimensions.➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg

Seems like it's targeted more towards the upper tier class customers able to install a charger in the comfort of their own home,btohqsg
Can't imagine having to compete for chargers in a HDB with such a low range 😰,btohqsg
I referring to the eye candy,btohqsg
Have seen ICE parked at EV charging station before and blatantly bochap!,btohqsg
how long does it take to fully charge Tesla Model 3,btohqsg
a full charge can last 4 to 5 days normal consumption ,btohqsg
Depends if you're using a fast charge. I think normal charge should be around 8 hours,btohqsg
Tesla may be faster  I may be wrong. But BYD normal charge would be around 8 hours thereabouts. Haven't tried fast charging on it,btohqsg
how u normally do ur 8 hour charge  trying to figure out the convenient way in practice,btohqsg
My in-laws have a private residence so charging is super convenient for them. Otherwise I guess the next convenient location would have to be HDB carparks!,btohqsg
last question  ur hdb carpark have 2 charging  can u book im advance,btohqsg
Wah  that I'm not sure already cause I havent tried it myself!,btohqsg

The new TnG cards are currently only available via the 'blackmarket' route (ie shopee / lazada). If you're desperate  can go there to buy.,btohqsg
Many have been trying hard to find in Malaysia...always OOS. So just patiently wait if you're not in a hurry.,btohqsg

Patriotism and nationalism has no monetary value to it de,btohqsg
