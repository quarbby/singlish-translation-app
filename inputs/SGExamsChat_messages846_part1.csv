idk a physics major fr has quite a lot of foundation to cover even without the irrelevant mods,btohqsg
Problem is need to do more to cover more,btohqsg
like bc of ICC  theyâ€™re now taking an important core in third year,btohqsg
then some other important stuff got cut out,btohqsg
Cue that guy on SGE reddit whenever someone asks about why it's 3 years,btohqsg
CC3 shld not be an icc mod if no one is applying it.,btohqsg
but if we were less thorough about our curriculum itâ€™d be tough to use it to apply for overseas masters lol,btohqsg
my friend had to take an undergrad mod to bridge when going germany for masters,btohqsg
I wonder how is intro to bio tho,btohqsg
