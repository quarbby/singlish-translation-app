CitiPM is 1.2mpd  are u confusing it with citi rewards card? That one has limit of 1k for 4mpd,btohqsg
Using this card just for booking hotels. So 10miles a dollar so wondering if there’s a cap for that 10miles,btohqsg
a quick googling led me to this doc:https://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/pdf/kaligo-accelerated-miles-and-thankyousm-poins-promotion-june.pdf?ecid=PSGONSGBGPENAWtake note it's only with kaligo  agoda is 7 miles instead. doesn't seem to have a limit and it's only valid till end 2022. i seldom use this since these 3rd party partnership sites usually jack up the price. but might be worth exploring again if it's 10x miles i guess 😅,btohqsg
Yeah I search about agoda and kaligo as well for the miles. Cause if I plan to spent 4k for travel and if there’s a cap k rather charge seperate to another card. As what I know HSBC revolution card has a 1k cap for miles. You mention 3rd party partnership jack up the prices may I know where do you usually book your stats or flights at? Or maybe can you share what card you use for travel,btohqsg
if it's more than 1K i usually just use my CitiPM anyway  i guess on hindsight i didn't really calculate whether the higher cost on kaligo/agoda is worth the additional miles  sorry can't share much on that.yea if its really high cost 4K i guess u just have to go with general miles card... even DBSWM has a cap on 2K,btohqsg
I think got lots of video at youtube. Better search there.,btohqsg
hi. anybody knows what is the mcc for using atome to make purchases?/,btohqsg

interetsing  DBS woman's card excludes AMAZE explicitly,btohqsg
So the only choice to pair with AMAZE  for 4mpd is Citi Rewards  am I right?,btohqsg
Not the only choice  but is the better one. Will talk about it soon in video,btohqsg
Since they have disabled sgd conversion or withdrawal  recently I'm trying to convert to usd and then international wire to dbs sgd account. I let the bank handle the conversion. Will report back the results once I receive it.,btohqsg
Can use grab card to top up the $300 to revolut?,btohqsg
For myself:FTX (USDC) -> Gemini -> Sell USDC to USD -> Buy GUSD with USD -> Sell GUSD to SGD -> Transfer to SG Bank,btohqsg
Can forecast what the public is going to respond already:1) $1M not enough lah  how to retire: proceeds to calculate by using savings depletion2) So young retire for what3) Probably another stupid Youtuber,btohqsg
It's good to plan and work towards a worthy goal!,btohqsg
