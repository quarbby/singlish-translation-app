filming uni vid make me realize how fking bad my voice is,btohqsg
r there like voice coaches for this kind of thing,btohqsg
but normally they do is for like singing and voice acting kinda thing  unless ur looking for speech therapy which isn't really for your case,btohqsg
The ones I know of no longer have slots according to another person that asked me.,btohqsg
How do you they are bots,btohqsg
@raznflame @cringrtardotcom&@sactiiii  what do the 3 of you think about Dawn FM?,btohqsg
Also @cringrtardotcom  is Gunna's DS4Ever good? I'm planning to skip it,btohqsg
I like it more than im supposed to LOL,btohqsg
Ig the 80s dream pop vibe is growing on me,btohqsg
I'm here for the radio vibes,btohqsg
Best songs are out of time and less than zero,btohqsg
OPN really be having the radio vibe on every album he executively produced,btohqsg
Maybe abel chose him specificslly for that,btohqsg
The tyler feature was dope tho,btohqsg
"The only thing I don't like about the album would be the missing rap-sung song on every album like ""Heartless"" ""Starboy""  ""Tell your Friends""  Land portion of ""KissLand"" and ""Glass Table Girls""",btohqsg
I feel like it was on purpose tho,btohqsg
Yeah  I really liked it. My 2 interests in one - songs and podcast/host show.,btohqsg
Yeah since there are already 2 rap features on the album,btohqsg
I genuinely loved the radio vibe,btohqsg
The Afterlife interlude made me laugh so hard,btohqsg
Listening to After Hours (Standard) and Dawn FM side by side is really an experience,btohqsg
HAHAH yeah but cant compare the two,btohqsg
After Hours is the reality with the deluxe tracks acting as emotions while Dawn FM is just death,btohqsg
Dawn seems like an escape from reality,btohqsg
I don't see it as an escape,btohqsg
My theory is that there are 3 separate Weeknds in the album,btohqsg
The intro sounds like someone just died and the outro is effectively someone accepting death,btohqsg
Unlike After Hours (Standard) where you can sense that you can replay the album again  Dawn FM is effectively just the end once you finish the album.,btohqsg
Damn abel keeps dying in his albums,btohqsg
It's been his thing since BBTM,btohqsg
The Weeknd during the intro and outro (I call it Vocal Weeknd)  The Weeknd during that interlude (Host Weeknd) and The Weeknd which sings throughout,btohqsg
This is enough Weeknd for this Weekend,btohqsg
Thats what someone else said  he hasnt done it,btohqsg
There  there  allow me to bring you into the light of school!,btohqsg
i actually liked the album… a lot of ppl didnt 😭,btohqsg
They probably dont appreciate the sound,btohqsg
It's effectively an album of a different format as compared to other Weeknd albums so that's expected,btohqsg

Disclaimer: my entire predicament is based of the alleged fact that The ceremony for the entire SG is today so if it isn’t just say no and u won’t have to read all the nonsense belowYo so uh I got this top 25% award in a letter that came with a cert for that and also a form for a bursary award thing??? Apparently my mom filled the form up and submitted the entire letter along with the cert to the CC to approve the form. Allegedly   the ceremony is today and thee entire SG attends it but I didn’t attend it as they said I didn’t receive any invite nor any mention of monetary rewards in the letter. They said if I were to get the aforementioned they wld send another letter but my friends didn’t get another letter. Just checking  if u get Top 25% u shld get an invitation on the initial letter right or must ur application for the bursary thing be successful  then u get an invitation?I always get top 10% but got screwed over by ART dnt and fce so idk if top 25% is any different.,btohqsg
Also one more thing if ur application get rejected do they send any letters to say or they just don’t do anything,btohqsg
