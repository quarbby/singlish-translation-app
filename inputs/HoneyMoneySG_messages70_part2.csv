Hi  I saw on UOB‚Äôs website they state that we will be getting 7.8% for 100K deposit. But why does some people only receives 5% rate?,btohqsg
because if you average out is 5% only.,btohqsg
i see! have anyone tried to transfer and credit $1600 from DBS to UOB? Does it work?,btohqsg
do a search  lots of datapoints already,btohqsg
anyone using uob stash know when will the bonus interest be given?,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows how to pay income tax with credit card? Apparently citibank can only that I don't know how. Is it under citipayall? Or from tax portal?,btohqsg
This is exactly what scammers work. Stealing data at the background and making your phone as a diummy node for other hackers.It will be stupid for anyone to believe all these nonsense.,btohqsg
Better not to use main phone to do it. Just factory reset use a sub phone if anyone wanna try.Similar to those crypto project. highly risky a lot of rugpull and scam.,btohqsg
If I prefer to keep SGX stocks in CDP  is Vickers the cheapest commission at $11.77 using cash upfront? What other options available?,btohqsg
Is there a way to invest in US treasury bond / similar money market funds using CPF OA? I only know endowus and there‚Äôs no such option,btohqsg
How do I participate this promo?As it stated Pending for free stock to be credited in 10 days. Means I will miss the 16 Oct deadline?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt change to Margin acct (need this for Moneybull) if having stock to be redeemed,btohqsg
Can check with CS what needs to be done as yours is a specific case of having pending stocks,btohqsg
Just stop all these non-regulated Financial products discussion altogether,btohqsg
is this for the salary credit criteria?,btohqsg
Does anyone know about MCC code (merchant category code ) ? Does whole world üåé shares the same MCC code ? Let‚Äôs say NTUC MCC are 5411. If I go overseas and use Singapore credit cards spend on overseas supermarkets will that supermarket use the same MCC code 5411?,btohqsg
So  where do the company get the money from ? Selling you personal data to dark web ?,btohqsg
Correct  I am trying to use DBS (Local Transfer and set it under ‚ÄúSalary Payment‚Äù to UOB account to fulfill the $1600 salary criteria.,btohqsg
Does it work? UOB activity tracker seems to update quite slow..,btohqsg
Perhaps you can start your own channel on this topic. Rather then coming in to this channel and recommend your product.,btohqsg
Hi! If I pair my citi rewards + Amaze for SP utilities  will i still get the 4mpd?,btohqsg
i see.. so the same as travel,btohqsg
similar  travel still have 1x point i.e. 0.4mpd  but utilities 0 points,btohqsg
yes if you select from the list it will work,btohqsg
SCB journey card any good guys?,btohqsg
the MCC is assigned by the card issuer (mastercard/visa) so by theory yes it should be the same globally.However there have been reports of some MCCs not really aligned with their businesses  particularly in Japan and Korea,btohqsg

Guys  what card should I link to my NTUC app for future purchase?I have ocbc 365  HSBC rev  cimb signature.Should I do same for other platforms like shoppee?,btohqsg
can use evol? i guess?i have trust card but i dont really link it to NTUC app.,btohqsg
I see.. I don't have that card.. not seeing any good promo yet.,btohqsg
Which card best use with amaze card for amazon transaction for miles earn   without limit?Most good miles card seems to have 1k max limit,btohqsg
if the MCC is right  UOB KF uncapped 3 mpd,btohqsg
But it seems like the 3mpd has a clause where there is a need to spend $800 on SIA group (excluding kris+) in a membership year,btohqsg
well can't have everything can we,btohqsg
This is correct. Note that you will be credited 1.2mpd first (1.8MPD will be credited 2 months AFTER CC year)Note that this doesn't apply to SIA-related spends (incl. Kris+)[3MPD directly],btohqsg
seems pretty inline with other miles cards out there,btohqsg
Paiseh mixed up with SCB smart - deleted my comment,btohqsg
My evaluation was the journey card was pretty inline with other miles cards. Only citi rewards + amaze was better.,btohqsg
Thing is  im lazy and want everything done with the same bank  haha,btohqsg
personal loan  credit card and everyday banking etc,btohqsg
Why trust unless using trust to pay Ntuc & kpitam will give more perk,btohqsg
cause the guy was asking for the NTUC app,btohqsg
Does anyone know if can use  Frasers frx evoucher to buy ntuc vouchers in NTUC in Frasers malls?,btohqsg
Can. Go to ntuc info counter to buy,btohqsg
decline transaction able to see the MCC code as well .i link wallet with no balance. and transaction it will fail because insufficient balance.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt see any declined transactions on amaze. Been trying multiple times for online orders via fast food/fave. Anybody can help?So far only the first-time transaction verification when adding amaze card as payment method to the merchant platform is visible,btohqsg
