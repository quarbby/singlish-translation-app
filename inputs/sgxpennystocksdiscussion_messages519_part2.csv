KTL & Mercurius both use grocery story to con,btohqsg
Mercurios zero revenue for past 6 years I canâ€™t understand why sgx allowed them to list,btohqsg
honestly... grocery and supermarkets hype is over,btohqsg
supermarket and groceries sales are normalising,btohqsg
Short SGX is best choice lousy exchange,btohqsg
nowadays people dont rush to supermarket to hoard,btohqsg
its time to look at shipping and logistics counters,btohqsg
because shipping and freight costs have increased a lot recently. so distributors might face margin pressure if they cannot pass on these shipping and freight costs to their consumers,btohqsg
supermarkets companies are like glove companies.... their season and time in the sun is over,btohqsg
now the companies to shine are SHIPPING and LOGISTICS companies,btohqsg
The Baltic Exchange Dry Index rose 0.1% to 4 195 on Thursday  close to itshighest level since mid-2010scaled on August 24th  amid an overall rebound in commodities demand and global shipping constraints.
