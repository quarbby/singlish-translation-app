This is a loophole that Oddle manipulates to cover their priority fee.,btohqsg
Lala app a lot flaws  orders cancel with valid reason also can't input. Mission cannot activate  users cancel orders also get rating dropped. Stupid app  lousy customers  shit fares... Knn. Do more die faster.Alibaba platform. Diu,btohqsg
HAHAHA! Thatâ€™s why the FT are taking over.,btohqsg
Their system sucks  cs anyhow. They do stunts  just like their customers.,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why they support each other mahh? Drivers have to do their part and cover our own asses.,btohqsg
I rather you all go do phv,btohqsg
Exactly  do like shit still earn peanuts.,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why I picky when choosing jobs. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Only doing tada now  only on grab when no ping,btohqsg
My llm account I think almost 23% commission cos non sticker van,btohqsg

You can make until no bar you also quite gaolat la say real,btohqsg

Bo bian fare low if item too much or too heavy user dun wan add money jus cancel,btohqsg
Why after customer add locaiton and I cancel cause I donâ€™t agree with the locaiton  I am getting put on the waiting list??,btohqsg
Customer added another delivery point and I cancelled,btohqsg
Next time just donâ€™t cancel first until you find the next job,btohqsg
The 30 mins wait fking annoying,btohqsg

Cannot create wo deposit money? Just to show profile page for petrol discount?,btohqsg
Hello guys  on average 10-12hrs a day roughly can fetch how much a day? Any tips from the old bird? Driving.,btohqsg
For sat/sun I would say $200 would be a nice and realistic target for beginners,btohqsg
For weekdays the prices are mostly atrocious so expect around $100 a day,btohqsg
So little for weekdays even 10-12hrs? Thatâ€™s quite bad though..,btohqsg
It is really advisable not to work solely as llm driver full time,btohqsg
What recommendation would you have instead?,btohqsg
As I am having a PHV license but unable to drive for them as my car unable to convert to Z10 scheme.,btohqsg
Work only weekends/ph as part time is good,btohqsg
Weekdays what platform would you recommend in this case?,btohqsg
Was really shocked to know that during weekdays can only earn average $100 for 10-12hrs drive..,btohqsg
How much is the commission in LLM?,btohqsg
Nah other platforms either not enough demand or the price lower than llm,btohqsg
Yea might as well work F&B,btohqsg
U wanna chiong 10-12hr with ur car,btohqsg
Was thinking about that  thanks bro!,btohqsg
Imo finding a courier company directly would be better since u have ur own vehicle also instead of using platforms,btohqsg
Since the income would more or less be stable,btohqsg
Some actually offer even lower have tried to search around  some pay like $3/$3.5 for a parcel itself. Mine is not a van is actually a sedan. But is fuel saving..,btohqsg
Because delivering with platforms like llm fp grab is more prone to delays be it sender side or customer side compared to parcel deliveries,btohqsg
$200/day?? Now still so easy to make $200/day with llm meh,btohqsg
Saturday & Sunday  should be able to with 10 hours on the road. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Should be able to especially if do both lunch and dinner peak periods and do some stacking,btohqsg
I see on average now jobs less than $20 after com,btohqsg
More than $20 need long distance,btohqsg
Need do 10+ jobs wor of at least $20 after com to get 200 after deduct petrol n all other expenses,btohqsg
The thing is have so many quality jobs bor  n whether u so lucky to win bidðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
