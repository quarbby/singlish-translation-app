What are the difference between Limit  Stop Limit and Limit if Touch?,btohqsg
there are alot of functions but most of the SGX brokers dont really support,btohqsg
Come on guys  not only MT fell. Most counter fell too. It’s just time for retracement for the next push. Be steady and overcome ur emotions!,btohqsg

SgYuantmr if break 134 i shld cut my 140 position?,btohqsg

Perhaps- Hanwell $0.27 to $0.28 range if can get and hold. Just keep in the bag.(Insiders loading a lot makes this one interesting)- PanUnited  $0.27 to $0.28 range.I am still collecting to keep for longer term investment. Recent day Volume getting higher then past 6 months daily volume.(Looks to be increasing in liquidity although selling down is happening. Testing support and I believe it reverse soon. Anyways  it’s all time lowest $0.225   highest over $1. Downside quite limited and when construction industry recovers  this one should easily go back to $0.33)- Amplefield  $0.029 to $0.033Should be good to collect some for mid term.,btohqsg
this is just to indicatebb dont need to push the stock to 3.88already profit from it like a 3.88 stockand just nice i the added value is 3.88the added total is just coincidencethis is how clever bb arebb i referring to houses,btohqsg
Lol. Yea. No volume today. Almost forgotten about this one.Yup Amplefield potential is there. BBs still inside  waiting patiently for I don’t know what too.,btohqsg
does medtecs have share buy back authority,btohqsg
or should i be expecting that since nothing happen when they are at 1.00,btohqsg
Oh I see....the 3.88 is also a nice coincidence and not necessary a TP by itself and can be total of smaller TPs.Clever 👏👏👏👍👍👍👍,btohqsg
I hope UG not like that leh....lol....just give me a simple TP....haha,btohqsg
