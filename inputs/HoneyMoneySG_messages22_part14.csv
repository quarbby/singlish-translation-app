Depends. If you have CRMC  Maybank fnf or other rewards credit cards  go for Amaze. Otherwise go for Youtrip,btohqsg
Cos of the points? Currency exchange rates same as youtrip?,btohqsg
Amaze's exchange rate is worse than YouTrip. However with Amaze you can earn credit card points. So pick your poison.,btohqsg
overall Amaze better 4mpd or 8%  no fx fees  get instapoint equivalent to 1%  but slightly worse foreign exchange,btohqsg
hello all  any comments on CardUp? i want to try to use it to pay my school fees next time  pairing it with my Amex card to earn miles. i cant use my Amex card directly to pay sch fees as it is not a supported card for payment,btohqsg
Amex fees are quite expensive  maybe consider using a different MC or visa,btohqsg
Oh well. For the privilege of getting more MR points I was considering ponying up for the Cardup fees... Thanks for your reminder aww,btohqsg
i saw that Amex on CardUp is having a promo on fees (1.6% for first time & 1.9% for subsequent). the potential miles to be earned outweighs the fees in my opinion,btohqsg
will give it a shot once & see how it is,btohqsg
Hi  just to check out if one hold on to a credit card just for miles rewards sufficient or both husband and wife will be a better combination?,btohqsg
I am an existing citibank card holder  how long do you all usually take to apply for new CC?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I'm new to here. Just have a quick question regarding which cc I should be getting. Thinking of citi prestige vs amex platinum charge card. Which will be a better one for travel etc and the value it provides. I have looked through the different benefits but still can't make up my mind.. lol,btohqsg
Between me and my wife  she’s more of a miles person I’m more of a Cashback person.I usually pay for stuff  but I don’t know how she can get so much miles “secretly” 😂But usually big items I’ll let her pay for it.But I think if both are aligned to the same purpose then the miles could chalk up way faster  and chances of getting seats together is easier I guess.Otherwise different accounts then might not get to seat together when flying,btohqsg
That is our current strategy also  thanks for the reply!! 👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻👍🏻,btohqsg
Yeah if you can look beyond sitting together for that long haul flightI think it would be quite fast 💨,btohqsg
Is uob one debit card great to get for student,btohqsg
uob one account combine with uob one debit for student is good,btohqsg
For me. 3 months still not approved. No info.,btohqsg
By right  once u apply  within 2 to 3 working day  u should get an answer  Else u can give HSBC a call For citi existing user  is almost instant once u apply thru the app.,btohqsg
Yes  crazy stuff. HSBC is by far the slowest in everything banking in Singapore. In contrast DBS despite (or because of?) their market dominance is rather fast in processing stuff.,btohqsg
Maybe they emphasis on hong kong only.,btohqsg
New to the SC smart credit card. Anyone knows what is the smallest denomination for exchanging the rewards points to cashback? How much must u spend to redeem the cashback?,btohqsg
2 500 SCB points minimum plus $25+ for 1 000 Qantas points3 200 SCB points for $10 cashback,btohqsg
Yes. SCB cards pool with Smart cards. If you have Visa Infinite cards 2 500 points can be redeemed for 1 000 KrisFlyer points/miles. You can only do the redemption via desktop.,btohqsg
3 500 SCB points to 1 015 miles.,btohqsg
Are there any referral promos for uob evol and uob savings account currently?,btohqsg
what card should i use to pay the deposit for wedding banquet ?,btohqsg
amount likely to be 4k  prefer to earn points for miles,btohqsg
have soon to be maxed out HSBC and citi rewards,btohqsg
This was the same error message when I tried to use liquidpay linked to my ocbc 365 ugh,btohqsg
Hopefully@Chriscan advise usSince he is using his single card strategy with amaze > CRMCMuch appreciated his feedback 🙏🙏Meanwhile  send email with error screenshot for LiquidPay to revert,btohqsg
Just to tap further on this  any idea when the additonal reward points will be awarded?,btohqsg
Usually 1 or 2 working days just like most FIs out there,btohqsg
Hmm then that is weird... because I have only been awarded the 1.6 points per dollar but not yet the bonus 17.6 pts....,btohqsg
Could it be that the bonus pts are credited in the nxt month? Anyone else who might know this? Thanks in advance 🙏,btohqsg
Ah yes thank you!The 17.6 extra SCB rewards points will be rewarded and awarded on the next statement month. Not the same statement month  gotta wait!,btohqsg
Is amaze down? Why I keep scan and got rejected? Using Google pay,btohqsg
Hi is there anyway to transfer money out of YouTrip ?,btohqsg
I’m overseas but YouTrip Mastercard was spoilt so all my money inside YouTrip account now,btohqsg
You can transfer out to other wallets such as Revolut  BigPay or Wise  if you have them.,btohqsg
Anyway to transfer to bank account ah ? Cos I don’t have other wallets,btohqsg
I encounted the same problem with liquidpay today at hawker QR.did a $10 topup to liquid cash instead. Mcc 5399 misc stores,btohqsg
Thanks Chris  will check CRMC and HSBC Rev T&Cs,btohqsg
YouTrip > GrabPay > transfer to own PayNow,btohqsg
Usually wedding banquets are at hotels. So  the cards that don’t have travel exclusions can come in.Do check with banquet organiser whether they provide online payment link?(DBS wwmc / citi smrt ),btohqsg
How is it possible to transfer from youtrip to grab? I can only do youtrip to other youtrip users.,btohqsg
Anyone applied for uob evol card or uob one savings account recently? How long did it take for application to be approved?,btohqsg
Add your YouTrip card (you can get your card details on the app) to Grab,btohqsg
then topup your YouTrip balance into your GrabPay wallet,btohqsg
From youtrip>grab and youtrip>Revolut  both unsuccessful for me,btohqsg
