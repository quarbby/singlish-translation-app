🚀Pika World Market Update - 28 Nov 2023🚀🎯Equity markets were broadly steady  although it came with a late sell-off to pare off any gains during the session.It comes as the latest housing data show signs of easing  which could bode well for inflation to fall further. This caused bond yields to fall as Treasuries continued to climb.🎯We will still be eyeing Core PCE data on Thursday and Uncle Powell's speech on Friday.🎯Given the sudden reversal in the late hours  we have suffered a significant loss given such a lack of risk management. The after-market for equity is showing some weakness as stocks are nearing their prior peak. Therefore  I will look for opportunities to cut positions wherever possible as we look to wrap up November and be in a better position for higher volatility ahead  and the risk is mounting.🎯There is little economic data today except for the Consumer Confidence index for November.It is 28 Nov  Tuesday  8.50 am in Singapore and 8.50 pm in New York. We are back in a relatively resilient market but will be more cautious and nimble.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
