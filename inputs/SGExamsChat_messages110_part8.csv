do you have evidence that you're being stalked at the very least?,btohqsg
Oh ok. Could be lucky  u come n talk to me.,btohqsg
Nvm  if don have  no need.,btohqsg
and 1 of my friend told me that they break friendship cuz she LOVE TO TWIST HER WORDS ALOT,btohqsg
I recently lodge a report to her sch,btohqsg
I have a few questions here:1. If you are bothered by her stalking  then i ask u  have u adusted the privacy setting to ur advantage?2. How did you know it is her cloning n faking conversation? If so  then no issue right cos u know it is not real3. If you have gotten over him  then your only problem here left is that she stalk u  am i right to say that?,btohqsg
So back to main point i think u need to settle the stalking issue thats all  right?,btohqsg
Since u lodged the report to sch and her friends also know she is like that  she is at a disadvantage not u,btohqsg
Academics are not everything in life..,btohqsg
But u need to tranquilize ur emotions of anxiety.,btohqsg
Have you tried not entertaining to any of her threats? Like not replying to her blocking her etc?,btohqsg
Where they go? Can find someone else anot? How do u usually handle your depression situation? Via counselling or got take medicine?,btohqsg
1. yes I changed all my acc and she screenshotted every single shit I posted on Insta last time ..2. I know cuz the way my ex type is nothing like the one she showed my friends3.well my ex is still trash talking abt me nvr ending,btohqsg
Anyway if she stalks u she is insecure right? So it is her problem u should know she is threatened by u lol,btohqsg
I didn't reply to any and she keep taunting me,btohqsg
Ok what sort of threatU need to go to the police n if is life threatening threats u need apply protection order,btohqsg
they got meeting they whole day tdy so no one to talk to.-.,btohqsg
Via counselling and no one else,btohqsg
but she isn't insecure her whole fb is abt me,btohqsg
1. Ok have u posted hideous things before? Or inappropriate things? If yes  just come clean n admit u were young and u have learnt not to anymore. Nothing to be scared of. And if u did not  but maybe feel personal n sensitive  is ok  let it go n dun post sensitive things on social media. Some things belong to our personal life  must be kept offline2. Then ok lor dun see any issue here3. Ppl talking shit about their ex is quite normal but matured listeners wil judge the person badmouthing his/her ex not u. U just need to focus on doing ur best n being ur best to falsify his thrash,btohqsg
Ya i kind of agreeThese counsellors psychologists n psychiatrists can only help externally. Internally the patient needs to go thru a lot to recover on their own,btohqsg
More like she is mentally sick,btohqsg
Lol shes funny. U can screenshot evthg down anot? Make a police report or report to telegram lor. U shd find a way to go police station apart from ur parents knowledge,btohqsg
HahahhahaIs either she is trying to fake play crazy to scare uOr she has lost her mind,btohqsg
Lol ðŸ˜‚ yes she sounds like,btohqsg
1. nope nth at all. I only posted about my sch and she is using my sch details to talk shit abt me and she can't even see my insta cuz I blocked her and they only way she can see is creating new acc,btohqsg
3. yes he fcking immmature ngl,btohqsg
I won't be able to see her insta my friends are the ones sending me abt it,btohqsg
Not unless u become the employer,btohqsg
I just hope the sch can just expell her,btohqsg
may i ask yall to participate in a mini survey I made for my stats project,btohqsg
thank you so much for helping  it will take less than 5 mins,btohqsg
We donâ€™t really allow surveys on here  but u can pop over togo.exams.sg/discordwhere thereâ€™s a dedicated channel for surveys,btohqsg
their logic is off by abit,btohqsg
Did you private your account btw  not sure how new accounts can see your posts then,btohqsg
I mean tbh i doubt we can help you. She seems determined to consistently stalk you and mock you to the point of roping in others,btohqsg
What exactly is she accusing you of,btohqsg
You can pm if you want,btohqsg
all I know tdy she keep talking abt my sch,btohqsg
You say your friends show you posts. She never accuses you of anything?,btohqsg
The more u do  the more she will continue,btohqsg
"If all she says is ""wow Nameless goes to School X lol what a loser"" then uh",btohqsg
THE TOPPIC FOR TDY WAS SCH,btohqsg
Thats sth you have to learn to cope  i guess,btohqsg
You said your l1r4 is 3x higher than hers maam if she is bashing your school  acads wise u rly have nth to be insecure about,btohqsg
Dont be weird yo just saying,btohqsg
Im a 13 year old XMM,btohqsg
As I said  we can't give the best advice here,btohqsg
Secondly  you just joined. We don't know anything about you  so we obviously can't help you,btohqsg
We cannot the BEST advice but we can give advice from personal experiences,btohqsg
