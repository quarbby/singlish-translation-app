capture market share lor. especially those who dont have the usual giro salary by hr. those are lost sheeps and maybe uob wants to take them in. or those that max out the real salary crediting threshold with their bank and looking to get more  uob also take in,btohqsg
yah I think to target those that max out at OCBC already. I'm one of those. haha.,btohqsg
without the paynow method  I will withdraw the 100k from UOB and put into HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
yup so i strongly believe they are aware and also welcome us to do this,btohqsg
take your 100k give you 5% then charge borrowers more. huat ah,btohqsg
Wondering why without the paynow method in UOB then u will put in HSBC EGA. I tht HSBC EGA has a higher interest rate at 5.3% as compared to UOB One at 5%,btohqsg
"I don't like the HSBC EGA ""uncertainty"" as you are assured of the amount received only few months later. So I prefer to max out OCBC and UOB first.",btohqsg

also  I opted-in in march so only 4.7%  unless I meet the condition to get extra 1% then 5.7%? but won't be getting 5.7% for the full amount also if I understand correctly.,btohqsg
Oh I opted-in in May  so base interest is only 4.3%. But I guess the extra 1% condition is quite easy to hit cause u just need to trf $2000 to ur EGA account and make 5 transfers out every month to get the bonus 1%,btohqsg
According to t and c  the 1% is on incremental amount from previous month  and capped at $300. Hence 5.7% not accurate  ‚Äúup to‚Äù is what the bank used. I think one of us already getting max $300 every month  please search for the Sifu üëçüèª,btohqsg
CIMB credit card is only for Singaporean right?,btohqsg
Any good credit / debit card for mrt and bus daily use?,btohqsg
$300 every month? Means need to top up $360k from 2nd month onwards. Wow. Mean $1.08 mil across 3 month.,btohqsg
Hello  anyone knows if the upcoming IT fair will accept credit cards?,btohqsg
Deduction is on the due date  not statement date,btohqsg
1% per annum(year) but not 1% of the amount. Hence  need to increase $360k per month.,btohqsg
Incremental on ADB  just to add,btohqsg
SC Smart  DBS Live Fresh  UOB One,btohqsg
do I need to register anywhere first before I can use a visa/MasterCard for public transport? or just tap will do?,btohqsg
Quick question  FavePay & Shopback Pay eligible for HSBC Revolution?,btohqsg
Is the cashback still applies if I use SC Smart thru Samsung Pay?,btohqsg
Shd apply. Mobile contactless shdn't change the MCC  other gurus here can confirm,btohqsg
Want to ask for Mastercard pair with instarem amaze  must pay via Google Pay with mobile contact less in order to convert the transaction to be online transaction?Can't use the amaze card directly?,btohqsg

Hi Guys  need ur help/ advise to confirm whether Top up of Youtrip acct using UOB card ‚Äî> does this top up fulfills the min sgd500 spending for the UOB one acct bonus interest? Thank you,btohqsg
This photo I took 5 mins ago for info for those who like to see how the actual atm looks like :),btohqsg
Nope  top up to any wallet is excluded,btohqsg
Thanks for your clarification. I wonder why when I watched the Chris youtube video  he always mentioned need to pair with amaze card and using mobile contact less to make payment?,btohqsg
Need to register your card details on simplygo app or online simplygo first I think sir,btohqsg
Only if merchant is under the HSBC Revo whitelist.Same answer to query above on SC Smart. Samsung pay/fave pay wdv pay doesn‚Äôt change the merchant code (MCC),btohqsg
What are the fees of using amaze card to withdraw money? Is the fees worth it to earn miles using amaze  or is better to use revolut/you trip?,btohqsg
All withdrawal u dont get rewards  it is consider cash advance and u will incurred high interest rate from bank,btohqsg
To clarify  this is solely for mobile payment. Physical card is fine too.,btohqsg
No need to register... Register on SimplyGo app will allow u to see the transactions you've made on the card...,btohqsg
It means either way  mobile contactless or physical card directly payment  will convert the spending as online spending  am I right?,btohqsg
Uob EVOL too using mobile app,btohqsg
Is UOB One the best card to pay for utilities? (4.33% CB),btohqsg
Hi  i recently applied for the DBS amex Yuu card and need to spend $350. I checked the exclusions and one of them is: j) payments to utility bill companiesWould you guys know if payment for starhub bill is excluded (is it part of utility bill companies)?Thanks,btohqsg
i think this refers more to things like Geneco  SP   etc.,btohqsg
note that it is VERY SPECIFIC.. only SP POWER,btohqsg
My electricity is with Tuas Power  but I pay on the SP app  still eligible?,btohqsg
yes..because Tuaspower use SP Power as biller..same combo as me.. it works! 4.33%,btohqsg
Hi. For HSBC TravelOne  when forwarding the approval email for Singsaver redemption  can we just forward the email or must we attach the email in a separate new composed message. Do we need to mention anything in the body of the email ?,btohqsg
Hi  may I check if anyone knows if hotel payments on agoda is eligible for uob evol online spending cashback?,btohqsg
Any idea how to transfer amaze wallet to grab? Or anywhere to use?,btohqsg
Any starters for student age 16-17 to get a footing of earning points to redeem and side hustle ?,btohqsg
I think the biggest issue is you are under 21 so you won't have access to a lot of products to help u earn points and side hustle.,btohqsg
However how can i start to prepare and live a more mindful mindset. My peers are ‚Äúpoor‚Äù and idw to be like them. Is there any way i can meet like minded people who share the same mindset,btohqsg
I think this community has quite a number of savvy people who have lots of knowledge.By reading their messages here  you might be able to pick up some tips.However  there is always a limit of what is shared in a public chat so I don't expect much spoonfeeding to take place  but there should be broad general tips that could go a long way in your path to financial freedom.,btohqsg
