Also because I can step the brake harder compared to trying to heel toe,btohqsg
And from 6 to 3 it's easy  but 3 to 2 I find it very difficult to do fast,btohqsg
Isn't that called the money shift,btohqsg
You don't have to over rev to do that,btohqsg
That's me most of the time when I was younger.,btohqsg
When you brake your speed and rev drops. That's why you can change gears,btohqsg
This one is enter wrong gear,btohqsg
Yea that's hw I normally do. But I see lots of video emphasising on protecting the clutch,btohqsg
Just have fun... Clutch isn't that expensive unless your driving a conti,btohqsg
any hanni fanboys here wanna send me their collection,btohqsg
i alr got a few of my own,btohqsg
I also think so  I rather save fuel than heel toe. But sometimes  I just heel toe for fun,btohqsg
If not what's the point right,btohqsg
i wan try turn base  oso sooo,btohqsg
start a vending machine at hillion,btohqsg
Rev match lor. Heel toe is only when you need to brake and downshift tgt,btohqsg
Very out of the way for me,btohqsg
plus there got alot of kids playing pokemon tretta there,btohqsg
I no time to go down restock,btohqsg
But hillion actually sounds like a good idea,btohqsg
n i alw see ppl there,btohqsg
so u might wanna consider lah,btohqsg
So is other end of the world,btohqsg

That side of the world need to come to us,btohqsg
or that retarded uncle i tell u about yesteday,btohqsg

bus got a left n right at the front door,btohqsg
everyone liek queue go the right door,btohqsg
so i go in by there when go no one?,btohqsg
@Bennchuaforgot to mention  your pedal position also affects. Last time I couldn't really do it on my kia.,btohqsg
haiz talk like wan fight me i talk back only no words to say to me,btohqsg
Just let him go lor if he wanna kp so much,btohqsg
My lancer  I think need to stretch a bit,btohqsg
ikr in the end oso never even fucking go up,btohqsg
My miat dunnid sia. Just roll only,btohqsg
On the kia it was the opposite of heel toe,btohqsg
It was more like my feet roll over the brake to tap the throttle,btohqsg
U see this guy  don't even need to stretch  can reach liao,btohqsg
Ya that's how I did on the kia,btohqsg
i been thinking yall talking about the tire toe...,btohqsg
i think i just stick to copying my notes,btohqsg
Wah those very hard to heel toe,btohqsg
But I need a wider shoe,btohqsg
I think just need to get used to it ba,btohqsg
If I use a narrower shoe  it doesn't tap the throttle,btohqsg
But nvm la  I find more fun doing double clutch,btohqsg
But my revs move too fast,btohqsg
On the kia it's slow super easy,btohqsg
