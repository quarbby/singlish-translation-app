Update on Yinda. Today opened above the downtrend trendline(or triangle) but didn't manage to close above it n above 2 MAs resistance. PA showed price came to 82 & buyers came in again. Already at the apex of the triangle(I didn't draw the bottom line. You imagine yourself). Monday is the deciding day. T+4 over. MACD histogram reversing up. 82 got buyers support. So the chance of an upward move is much higher.,btohqsg
Looking forward to Yinda Monday. Loaded more 82 and got it. Hope all yinda holders Huat Monday.,btohqsg
Happy Saturday everyone. Spend time with Family.,btohqsg
