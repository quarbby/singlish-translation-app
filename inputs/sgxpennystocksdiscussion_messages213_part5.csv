Amplefield likely to have bottomed at $0.032. $0.032 - $0.033 good price to collect. looks like they have rested enough since the recent spike up to $0.040. Flushing over and there buyers coming in to collect $0.032 to $0.034 from my observation.If can hold. can buy. Not for contra game yet.Good luck DYOD.,btohqsg
