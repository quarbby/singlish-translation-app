Some questions also like to test elements that can be oxidised and reduced at the same time,btohqsg
Think the student wasn't even sure Na oxidation state,btohqsg
Imo redox is harder than mole concept  esp when it comes to constructing half eqns and combining them together,btohqsg
same  even during As I think I got the redox qn wrong. Ochem was a lot easier imo.,btohqsg
Just imagining a mom coming in,btohqsg

Guys  whatâ€™s the usual salary for an intern? The HR for the company that Iâ€™m about to intern at just called me and the base salary that I heard is 2X what Iâ€™m expecting lol. Was pleasantly surprised  in my head Iâ€™m like did I hear wrongly? But Iâ€™m like better not say anything until the contract is signed HAHAHA.,btohqsg
$25 per month for an intern?,btohqsg
might as well dont do lol,btohqsg
Higher than SAF NSF Recruit pay,btohqsg
Wait I don't see 25 in this message,btohqsg
2X as in multiply by 2,btohqsg
If your expectations were really low,btohqsg
I think I heard of seniors getting anywhere from $500 to $1000,btohqsg
I heard something higher than that. HAHA at this point Iâ€™ll just assume I heard wrongly. Iâ€™ll see what appears in the contract. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
For a uni intern I think you can fetch up to 1.2-1.6,btohqsg
Not sure if there's a differenciation in the years tbh,btohqsg
Cos I'm only basing my stats on a single experience,btohqsg
Oh the company which I interned for paid scholars 2k,btohqsg
But it's only a single stat,btohqsg
If ur handwriting is rubbish  they will deduct marks I thot,btohqsg
Idk my teacher mark o levels  say when they see unreadable handwriting  straight zero,btohqsg
Obv not like some snake like that,btohqsg
But can make sense can alr,btohqsg
After all itâ€™s not my problem,btohqsg
Is yâ€™all MEO give us so little time,btohqsg
But in hh pp  at the end u handwriting will prob turn into straight lines,btohqsg
I doubt they ever purposely deduct marks. It's more like not award marks because cant read cant judge. So instead of actively deducting marks for handwriting it's more like your handwriting self-imposed a mark ceiling on your work.,btohqsg
But social studies example seem to be very easy for the most part rite?,btohqsg
