mayhaps uh but kinda sad ngl,btohqsg
For me I really found no point in studying sec school style in JC,btohqsg
The best way is to score well in poly  go to work get some moolah  then go back study full-time degree,btohqsg
You will be a degree grad with probably 2 years experience immediately upon convo  which is a much higher standing than your peers.,btohqsg
It is true that I don't use much of the degree  so it's literally just a paper for me now,btohqsg
Highly likely I know how to maintain and use my equipment better than the profs..,btohqsg
Both pathways have their own risks. A bad A level cert that is unable to enter uni is useless for work  while a diploma is sufficient even if the GPA is stellar. This kind of case usually DAE to poly or retake As.As for diploma  might be harder to enter uni  sometimes even with good GPA.,btohqsg
at the end of the day  just make sure you know the kind of path you wanna take,btohqsg
but like now there's quite a few more IP schools  so those are kinda pigeon holed from the start into the A level system,btohqsg
I mean when you’re sold an idea through TikTok etc that you can become an entrepreneur or influencer easily then you’ll start to think “what’s the point of education” lol,btohqsg
influence of social media type beat,btohqsg
But of course at the end of the day it’s not that easy in life ah and not everyone can become influencers and entrepreneurs; in fact it’s only a small number that can earn any money from it  and much less a lot of money and become rich,btohqsg
I think ironically its coz ppl dk how good it can get,btohqsg
The feeling of the world being your oyster,btohqsg
or the yolo tiktok life got into their head,btohqsg
alot of ppl in sg js be resting on their laurels,btohqsg
take things for granted in a sense,btohqsg
so they end up not looking ahead,btohqsg
which can be quite saddenjng ngl,btohqsg
Sg alr q good compared to alot of other places,btohqsg
I feel u need to get a taste,btohqsg
its like we reach first class nation so fast,btohqsg
now other countries gon catch up to us,btohqsg
we rest somemore later other countries become better than us,btohqsg
Before u decide to work 2wards it,btohqsg
But ironically to get a taste of it u are alr there,btohqsg
Ya but who will be willing to give u a tester of the high life,btohqsg
Internship i feel u more than likely only get to experience the bad,btohqsg
And also if u can secure a internship of that calibre u more than likely alr know what to do,btohqsg
u experience the bad then uk whether or not u wanna tahan the bad,btohqsg
But u dont get the good so its hard for u to weigh,btohqsg
Weak mental is unfortunately too common,btohqsg
Tendencies to have too much self pity,btohqsg
And no confidence in ur own ability,btohqsg
but snorlax gon kill me for saying tt,btohqsg
But I need to push on ik la,btohqsg
cuz i got 98 for my proj,btohqsg
Cuz I feel like it's the btr opt for me,btohqsg
Honestly i hate the chinese mentality of humility,btohqsg
I thinking probs need time to adapt to this whole lect and tutorial thing,btohqsg
If its by ur own merit just show it off,btohqsg
mine was i was actually panicking,btohqsg
cuz i didnt know if my proj was ok,btohqsg
Ya won't lie hard to feel proud of my work cuz of it,btohqsg
more often than not it leads to imposter syndrome lol,btohqsg
Showing off its for you to convince urself also,btohqsg
my mentee in RI also feeling it,btohqsg
and alr questioning how she even got in,btohqsg
I questioning my general ability la,btohqsg
I realised my logic made no bloody sense,btohqsg
