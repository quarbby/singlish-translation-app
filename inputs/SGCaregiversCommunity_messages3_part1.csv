Hello Greg  I am not sure if your students are aware of the existence of VintageRadioSG and how what we do can play an important part in contributing to the general well bring of Seniors and also as a means to better communicate with them. Perhaps there can be an opportunity of better synergy in the efforts put forth to move SG into becoming an Age-inclusive society?,btohqsg

HI Jane  to protect your interest  we have removed the bank transfer screenshots for now. And contacted you separately to see how we can be of any assistance.,btohqsg
I have clarified with Greg that it was not me who shared the the bank transfer screenshots on the post .  I merely responded to the article published by The Pride on the caregiver ‘s story and this has already been accepted by Greg . So perhaps there need to be more stringent checks on the community who wish to post information on the post so as not to creat misunderstanding with others in the group .,btohqsg
Hope this clarifies the situation :),btohqsg
