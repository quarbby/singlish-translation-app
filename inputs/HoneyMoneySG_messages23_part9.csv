hi  guys. for ocbc 360 account  as long as my monthly average balance is 500 sgd higher than last month is ok to qualify 500 sgd saving? i can withdraw money from 360 account?,btohqsg
Hi guys i recently just found these youtube videos and wanted to ask a noob question.Cards like amex or whatever that qualify for extra points are only based off transactions not top ups right?,btohqsg
yes if u are sure the average daily balance as of end of month is $500 higher than that of last month,btohqsg
depends whether the card exclude topups,btohqsg
Also i‚Äôve been waiting for a premium credit card video or does anyone here have thoughts on those like amex plat  black  infinite  metal etc,btohqsg
Really dont like the +$500 save criteria.  If im already at 100k  i still need to put in extra 500 every month that dosnt earn any interest,btohqsg
I‚Äôm in for GXS! Quickly get the save boost while stocks last. Can honey money make a video for GXS soon?,btohqsg

Hi  need some advise on DBS WWMC. I made quite a few payments like singtel bills  Kris pay plus a few more other online transactions. However  it‚Äôs been close to 2 1/2 weeks and the DBS points hasn‚Äôt been credited into my account. Does it take longer than usual  I‚Äôm comparing it to the vantage card- am getting points 2-3 days after transaction,btohqsg
Is it only for travel  other categories also 4mpd?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc only gives 10x points per $5 spent. You spend 4.99 don't get 10x,btohqsg

Hello... need some advice  I spend a lot on air tickets (SQ  Scoot  Garuda  etc...) monthly... already have UOB One  Live Fresh  so resorting to UOB Amex most times... is there another card that can do better for air tickets before going for UOB AMEX 1.7%?,btohqsg
u spend 4.99 u still get 8-9 DBS pointsdont worry,btohqsg
so long you charge at least 0.60cents to wwmc  u still get dbs points... just delayed.. minimum $0.60,btohqsg
How long does nestia take to approve the union pay wallet,btohqsg
Don't think telecom bills give 10x points,btohqsg
Telco bills gives 10x so long paid adhoc via online / app,btohqsg
So does citi rewards have the same effect?,btohqsg
i think it's good for people has less money in 360 account hahaha.,btohqsg
Telco bills  utilities will get 4miles per dollar if made online via citi rewards?Petrol is paywave via hsbc can ge the 4mike per dollar?,btohqsg
Hi  just to check anyone with ocbc 360 account actually sign up for ocbc 365 credit card? Is it worth signing?,btohqsg
Why does GxS have a limit of $5k?,btohqsg
Worth it if u can spend $500 and keep $100k inside  and/or meet 800 min spend on the categories,btohqsg
dbs wwmc 4mpd for online so long not excluded.hsbc revolution 4mpd for contactless/online for whitelisted MCCs,btohqsg
