Yeah no one couldnt understand the complex logic,btohqsg
Like Punggol 5room  second timer is 13.7.  My understanding is it‚Äôs an average of 13 couples consisting of second timer fighting for 1 unit.,btohqsg
Ya this seems like the logic.Median rate represent 0.5. The description is saying that look for lower than median.,btohqsg
Oh ya I just thought of your 1st March appt,btohqsg
Cos if u do and have selected. Then your Feb application if u really apply will be void.,btohqsg
Yes this one make sense. Of course if i get flat booking already. The bto will definitely forgo.,btohqsg
U are in a 5050 now haha,btohqsg
I will still be going if there is enough supply and within the budget.,btohqsg
Either SBF which is a guarantee in a way just unit nice or not VS Feb bto getting Q number or not,btohqsg
Right  i just dont want miss out the chance if i cant get any SBF. Its really slim. Thanks for understanding my question.ü´°,btohqsg
No worries. Your not the first I met with such issue.,btohqsg
There are some even more complicated than yours,btohqsg
Interesting  will look out and learn from this channel.  Cheers and good luck !,btohqsg
Based on my understand  not possible. They will treate it as forfeit and you will need to wait for a year under the new ruling,btohqsg
anyone feel feb24 bro not as enticing?,btohqsg
is rthere any telegram for Fernvale Vines,btohqsg
hihi  anyone kind enough to explain what the application rate means? Like the numbers for first timer fam and 2nd timer fam,btohqsg
Anybody know if after getting queue number and called down for selection  but didn‚Äôt select  what is the penalty for first timer ?,btohqsg
I thought you are able to reject the selection twice..?,btohqsg
I believed it‚Äôs once as a first timer  the next application as 2nd timer  and lucky enough to get queue number and called down  then will be banned for 1 year,btohqsg
May I know where can i get these official info from?,btohqsg

Wow thank you so much ü´°ü´°,btohqsg
Hi  anyone having issues selecting 3 room option for feb 2024 punggol project?,btohqsg
Where u check this status info from?,btohqsg
I'm new to Bto. Last nite Tampines st 41   blk 414  5th floor got fire   thick and black smoke at abt 7:15pm. Fire engines arrived and quick access at right below the block open carpark space.Wonder how at bto high floors to have quick access especially the blocks surrounded by carpark roof top gardens.,btohqsg
Every building in SG has a fire escape plan I believe.. even the 70 storey swissotel Stamford.. scdf will have a way to reach u.. if u are stuck up there just take nearest stairs to run down,btohqsg
Not sure bto have quick access to water supply for fire extinguishing access at every floor level..,btohqsg
This is exactly true..at least a 1.5kg ABC extinguisher for mid to high floor. After seeing the real fire   at the spot where you heard people screaming  smell the thick harsh black smoke smell  glasses broken sounds   neighbour's voices  running and heavy feets stamping everywhere and black horror smoke coming out from windows   every seconds is so priceless..the feeling really sinking into the heart..Waiting fire engines is a norm   but what save lives is those early seconds before fire engines/ ambulance arrive or into action..,btohqsg
Can I ask  my friend asked me she just converted to Singapore citizenship  does she qualify to apply BTO? Or there's a term to wait few years of holding Sg citizenship only allowed to apply?,btohqsg
If her singpass already become Pick IC   or converted already gotten her ic then can,btohqsg
PR singpass is blueSC singpass is pinkThe digital ic,btohqsg
Talking about this. And it happen today,btohqsg
The unit is just on 3rd floor.. Imagine BTO now cramp and narrow space for fire engine to arrive   high floor waiting rescue will takes time..Better own household keep ABC 2kg tank and know how to use   especially high floor BTO,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say we got a fire extinguisher. How does it help if it‚Äôs other people‚Äôs house that got fire? U mean when escaping  can use to put out fire and clear the way? Haha,btohqsg
If own house   extinguish before too late for waiting the rescuers. If neighbourhood got fire   seeing no quick rescue can quickly offer life saving help.My concern is seeing BTO now and common older hdb   the access is different  especially high floor bto.,btohqsg
as someone who trained in SCDF b4  I can safely say a 2kg extinguisher would last less than a minute. So yeah a fire extinguisher is useless in most circumstances. A Emergency Escape hood would be more useful  although its efficacy is still debatable considering it last only for few minutes.,btohqsg
Hi anyone got grp chat link for the sin ming residences dec 2023 bto,btohqsg
Hi  anyone having issues applying for 3 room BTO despite HFE letter stating ‚Äúeligible for 3 room‚Äù? As in  the option to select 3 room flat doesnt appear on the drop down at all?,btohqsg
Yup  apparently can only call during office hours though. Shall try on monday. Meanwhile i‚Äôve already submitted an eform for issues.. just wondering if anyone is facing the same.,btohqsg
Yeah  tried on desktop Windows  and iphone interface on 3 different devices..,btohqsg
Tried selecting every project. The drop down still only shows 4rm/4rm and 5rm. No option for 2rm flexi either..,btohqsg
Right? üò≠ Maybe a glitch.. Hopefully they can resolve it by the deadline and still put in my application..,btohqsg
Definitely less than. And the HFE states eligible as well.,btohqsg
Fingers crossed ü§ûüèªü•≤ Thanks for the replies!,btohqsg
Hi  can anybody enlighten me y the 2nd timer median rate is NA for 5room Sengkang? No SBF flats set aside for 2nd timers?,btohqsg
Does ur hfe show u are eligible for any cpf grants for new flats? If u get grants it means u are below $7k ceiling. If u don't have grants it's means u are above $7k and it is not a glitch. The only 3 room that you can book is Tampines mature estate SBF 3 room..,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôve applied for four room this time  but after consideration we wish to apply for five room  can I just cancel my application and reapply and pay another $10? üò≠,btohqsg
Yes can cancel as much as you like,btohqsg
Wait for last day then decide,btohqsg
