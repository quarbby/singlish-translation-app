okay but owner count is one indicator only. I have seen 6 owner cars in better condition than 2 owner cars.,btohqsg
what's the biggest indicator for you to stay away?,btohqsg
if they dont allow me do PPI or mileage tampering,btohqsg
if u see the tyres are bald  u will know how well the prev owner took care of the car,btohqsg
1800cc altis 1210kg. With full sound proof at most 1600kg? Not heavy,btohqsg
PPI stands for Pre Purchase Inspection. Before you buy any 2nd hand car  please to a PPI to check for any kind of unusual wear that we cannot see from the surface. For example  sometimes maybe the suspension or joints are at the brink of collaps but without lifting up the car  you really cant tell.Mileage tampering is when they reverse the mileage indicated on the odometer to show a lesser mileage and sell for higher price. This is illegal and dishonest. I usually stay away from this kind of sellers because more likely than not the car will come with inherent issues. Mileage tampering can also be checked during PPI.,btohqsg
Now can also dump car  when bear market comes  buy car,btohqsg

i got a question guys  if my headlamp was originally Yellow colour (old model) and i changed it to white light headlamp  need change back during inspection?,btohqsg
Highly dependent.  Many changed to HID 6000k no issues while some face issues with the inspection. So it's very hard to say actually...,btohqsg
Inspections look for brightness levels luminosity kind of things right?,btohqsg
