You should1) contact the DM and principal2) report to police if nothing is doneIf situation doesn’t resolve  bullying is a valid reason for transferring schs. Ppl use it as a reason for transferring in Pri or sec sch so I think it should work for JC too,btohqsg

the dm already knkws abt it,btohqsg

Which is why I think honestly should just try to report it and get it resolved asap  if the situation doesn’t improve the chances of transferring early would be maximised if it’s requested sooner,btohqsg
Also rmbr about keeping the evidence,btohqsg
