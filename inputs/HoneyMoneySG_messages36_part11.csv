Hi  just wondering anyone been to malaysia via the e-gates for singaporean? Do we need to have a MAC for it or just submit MDAC will do? Thanks,btohqsg
Base on what I know  you need to submit the MDAC but the first visit after that  you will need to go via the Manual counter to register  need to inform them. it's only for activation but on that day must come back via Manual counter or you can try your luck with the e-gate. The following week each time before heading to Malaysia  submit the MDAC and try your luck with the E-gate. Sometime it works  something it doesn't from what I heard.,btohqsg

Anyone knows why my spend on the eligible card is $679 (using UOB EVOL)  but in the app  it‚Äôs $459.21?,btohqsg
All transactions have been posted as of today,btohqsg
Is your evol statement date align with uob one account?,btohqsg
One is cc bill cycle  the other by calander mth,btohqsg
Is some of your spends not eligible? Like utilities ? Can check evol terms and conditions for eligible spends,btohqsg
This was my latest (previous) statement date for EVOL,btohqsg
This is the current spend that i had incurred for EVOL,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think they are the same dates..Does this mean to qualify for the Level 1 interest  the $500 spend has to be within my cc bill cycle..?Edit:My Evol statement date is every 15th of the month.My UOB ONE statement is by calendar month (end of each month),btohqsg
Hmmm I have checked and the spendings are within the eligibility categories üòÖ,btohqsg
tally the tracker with your UOB evol transactions posted in march only. (Note the tracker may have 1-2 days lag),btohqsg
Call them up to align your evol statement date with uob one,btohqsg
In the meantime manual track your uob one spending using posting dates,btohqsg
Anyone have luck calling UOB hotline? ^,btohqsg

Hi guys  I have an encounter which I'm not sure if u encounter too.I have allocated 100k in my UOB ONE acct.  Fullfill the criteria of $500 spend and salary credit. Why a. I not getting the $500 worth of interest based on the effective interest of 5%. I only get $300 plus. Anyone encounter this?,btohqsg
Hello  i just downloaded webull app & signed up. How to load even 1cent?,btohqsg
5% is annual. Monthly should be around $400 or so based on $5000 a year. I notice that the interest will vary depending on the days of the month. For Feb it will be lower due to fewer days.,btohqsg
u hold at least 100K average balance for the full 30days?,btohqsg
Account - Transfer - Deposit - Fast   the 4 steps in the app,btohqsg
Put 100 sgd or something more into webull though. Just for margin i guess,btohqsg
Done on mobile device or computer?,btohqsg

Saw all banks both US & EU in the red .. see next few days how it pans out.,btohqsg
Ya last night's all sector Red,btohqsg
EU not as united as USA (united states). ECB led by Christine Lagarde (a french national); also unsure if stricter EU regulator may not b helpful as in USA (where politicians r powerful). CS lifeline from SNB? on edge.. really record low... Amazing.. &SVB  uk offered ¬£1 üòïDid i read  hear it right?,btohqsg
I think every sector that was exposed to banks were hit   some tech stocks seem to still be green after trading today,btohqsg
Your Statement cycle is mid of last to mid of current mth based on Statement Date. Current spend is your total spend asof time you view your spend which includes amt due to pay but you have not already done. While tracker shows eligible spend in that calender mth. Like some here said tracker can lag abit but should show the correct eligible spend. This part has no issue for me so far.,btohqsg
