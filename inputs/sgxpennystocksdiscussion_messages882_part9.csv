Today we will have the most awaited 10-year Treasury yield auction.A dismal auction that leads to higher premium for sale or a low bid-to-cover ratio will spell trouble for equity bull sending yield much higher.A bid-to-cover ration reflects the dollar amount of bids taken in during an auction. So you can imagine if there is lower ratio  it means more premium has to be offered to entice buyers to purchase to complete the auction and that translates to higher yield. Since yield is inverse relationship to stocks  a higher yield depresses stocks prices sending equity indices lower.Hopefully  the rainy weather is wealth dripping from the sky for everyone!Cheers Pika Nat.ðŸ§ƒ,btohqsg
