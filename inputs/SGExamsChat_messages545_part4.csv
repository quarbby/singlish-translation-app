rp's grading system enables a 1.47 to become a 3.0 in one semesterand vice versa,btohqsg
cuz siyan is reminding me that i woke up at 5pm instead of 12pm and we ended up playing night bowling instead of aftnn bowling,btohqsg
but yes essentially work smart..because the grading system in rp is not regulated,btohqsg
So this also means Rp has a bellcurve for most of its modules,btohqsg
that is why i can get a B grade for a quiz that i scored 7/24 on,btohqsg
and why i also can get a B grade for not submitting completed work,btohqsg
cause i failed my major exams,btohqsg
i couldnt submit but my sch auto submitted without updating me zz,btohqsg
depends on the module...its either daily grade   msa  Ese 20/20/40  60/25/35 and many more diff combinations,btohqsg
i manifest 4.0 for u ez,btohqsg
