"If u have $5m ""cash""  u also have returns. Like govt savings bond also have 2.75% return. So say u still at $1m HDB property  $4m cash  you can get risk free return of $110k per year. Enough for family of 3 to 4 expenses (normal).",btohqsg

Or depend on public services all life long,btohqsg
Got health insurance  if not got medishield at least,btohqsg
Unless u got child need $3m pill for cure,btohqsg
