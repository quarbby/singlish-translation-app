bring pampers bro maybe should be ok most cs will track u  and u go to toilet they will be not happy with it,btohqsg
Ok i will try to change to car la instead of bike,btohqsg
I drive car. But I feel nowdays bike probably better. Solely for the reason that costs lower(petrol parking). Because all the fares now very low. Whether is bike  car  van etc,btohqsg
Since all low  might as well go for the lowest cost vehicle if you have license for both bike n car,btohqsg
And chances of getting a crazy big amount of stuff to deliver is still lower for bike  even though nowdays all the vendors chut pattern,btohqsg
But again I drive car  so I can't be sure about bike,btohqsg
But llm now really not worth it for car  be it full time or part time,btohqsg
Got car go do grab better  llm for bangalas and retirees.,btohqsg
You picked the worst time to join. Just letting you know that itâ€™s not what it used to be. Need to lower your expectations by a whole lot to avoid disappointment later.,btohqsg

Just tell them food sent. Food restaurant gave u wrong,btohqsg
So u end up sent wrong food cause restaurant gave u wrong food la. Only prob is u blue so act blur all the way. Customer collect food no see? Know not their food also makan? Nt your fault leh,btohqsg
At most take away both order delivery fees,btohqsg

Make police report customer damage the food by eating it hen nt theirs then expect u pay,btohqsg
Delivery drivers for food is just a waiter or waitress,btohqsg
Customer see food not theirs suppose to report to restaurant. Not eat it and claimed for compensation,btohqsg
When does waiter need to pay for customer consumption of wrong food,btohqsg
Ya thays what I said lo,btohqsg

Why get yourself angered for what? Donâ€™t have good fares or incentives  go other platforms. Better still donâ€™t drive.,btohqsg
Hahaha. They need rename to cheebye move. So smelly this company,btohqsg
Because cb move try to exploit new drivers,btohqsg
Wake up out of your fantasy dream Ryan!!!! 1 hour delivery to these places for this price at that??? Cheap to the core man!!!,btohqsg
Rabak sia. Should book separately then still ok,btohqsg
Total time allowed to send is 3hrs. Even sent after 3hrs sharp after pick up no penalty. Since customer wants to tekan. Can take the job  take 3hrs to complete. Nothing he can do. The fker himself didn't prepare food early. Get the driver to do his shit job for him. Just fk him. Teach him a lesson. He has to prepare his food early. Wah his customer break fast means we drivers need to break traffic rules speed 140kmh for him? He collect some money from his break fast customers means they king and he commander..... LTA and other ppl safety not important liao?Llm shld ban him,btohqsg
Best is DONT take  he deliver himself,btohqsg
