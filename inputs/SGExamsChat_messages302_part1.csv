As long as you have child debit card its pretty straightforward,btohqsg
I'm still confused between debit and credit,btohqsg
debit is your own money  credit is you borrow from bank and pay later,btohqsg
I didn't know cookie run oven bake has mala sauce cookie,btohqsg
debit deducts from your bank account directly upon payment.credit  bank pay first  you pay later at the end of month.,btohqsg
Will the bank charge interest for credit card,btohqsg
No they charge you a tonne if you’re late,btohqsg
Not if you are late in payment.,btohqsg
Credit card companies earn from merchants who pay a commission on every transaction.,btohqsg
but if you pay late  banks charge a 2% interest a month  with a 1.5% finance charge.,btohqsg
they already earn from the merchants.,btohqsg
what kind of job u LF?,btohqsg
but I'm contacting some employers rn,btohqsg
But why oni 2 weeks tho,btohqsg
"I dun get the part where you say "" before the one i""",btohqsg

and then a lot of jobs req >16 yrs,btohqsg
so rn I looking for some before the actual job,btohqsg
Uncle think Michael Chilly is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
