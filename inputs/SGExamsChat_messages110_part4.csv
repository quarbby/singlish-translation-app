My year was plot scatter diagram on a graph paper,btohqsg
Actually 2019 is easy but the problem is that p2 got a lot of answering qn that don't involve numbers,btohqsg
Then after that 2nd order DE qn,btohqsg
Not with like numerical interest lol,btohqsg
They ask us for 2019 the method for some football thingy,btohqsg
Haha that’s the only PnC qn,btohqsg
Bro that PnC number so big,btohqsg
Like usually PnC u expect exact answer,btohqsg
But this time they allow estimation,btohqsg
I still cannot believe the linear regression qn thi,btohqsg
Anyways I fucked up that and added it,btohqsg
Like srsly  have to draw the graph on the qn paper,btohqsg
Glad they changed to writing space so they have a grid on the qn paper itself,btohqsg
At least u can exactly draw it,btohqsg
Sometimes people kinda fuck up the spacing,btohqsg
Then the tutor can be anal and penalise,btohqsg
Omg suddenly rmbed about the paper 3 chem exam lol,btohqsg

Oh yes then the 2018 H2 math paper 2 right,btohqsg
Like they get trolled by the 2nd order DE qn alr,btohqsg
Still wanna test the real DE,btohqsg
Meanwhile 2019 give like 2 ez DE qn,btohqsg
