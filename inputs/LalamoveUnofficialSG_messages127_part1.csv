I too lazy to cancel thru cs,btohqsg
He say he and his friend share the fee  then say he student all. I laze ah bro,btohqsg
Ask me lesser by 5 I say max 2 LOL,btohqsg
lalamove going to IPO soon btw,btohqsg
the missions also bullshit one  must be on same day to clock  if mission is for sat and you take a scheduled job today for next day Sat  its no-count LOL,btohqsg
Huh how come you got mission,btohqsg
Proof. Using etherscan to validate time of picture taken (aka not photoshopped lol),btohqsg
Thats why I already said lalamove is using algorithms to target people with incentives and jobs...,btohqsg
He want 2 give u more  hoped u can accept,btohqsg
Ytd morning   I told 1 guy my back seat not for u to put your dirty carton boxes  who will pay me for the cleaning of my backseats due to your dirty carton boxes.Then Ytd evening   I told another guy   my backseat not for passengers to sit   because I am lalamover.  Only for boxes to be sent ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚.I only deliver items in my car boots.  Don't come dirty my backseat ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So many customers assume the front seat   back seat and boots are theirs to abuse after paying less than 20$ for a lalamove car order.  WTF are these people thinking.The dimensions stated how many cm by how many cm means how many.  Exceed then shld use a van or mpv. There are several drivers spoil such dimensions and items limitations for car orders. Behaving like labours who can't think and go by the rules.The customer told me other drivers can fetch for him   I told him then he shld find that driver to send for him again.  On the spot I took his things down and assist him to cancel.  Don't abuse my car.,btohqsg
If want to fetch passengers or several heavy boxes  why not go do grab or gojek.,btohqsg
All should take a piece of his actions and implement.I do too!! Otherwise pay an extra $10. And Iâ€™ve had people who refuse to that arrangement and I said goodbye.,btohqsg
Ask them if they all weigh max 25kg. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Another question is how about the entrance fee . I know lala vehicle is free for enter . If they take grab need to be add in right,btohqsg
At 5:14pm on a Saturday is at least $30+ to $39 for grab + entry fee6 seater $40+,btohqsg
Lesson learned. Next time I call lala mpv too ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Hopeless  Sentosa cove somemore  really cheapo till the maximum until Dunoo how to say,btohqsg
Cheapo  kanchong; kiasu  characteristic of Singaporean,btohqsg
Sinkie abuse sinkie.  Pay some money on a platform assume they own the car and start with their own narratives.  Siao. They can't read the dimensions for car delivery.  Suddenly they turn themselves into delivery parcels. Let's watch how they abuse as time passes.  More and more anyhow lol,btohqsg
In this case strictly speaking   any lalamove drivers without fetching passengers license may end up in trouble,btohqsg
Now customers use llm order with their own wish never read through the usage. Drivers become their personal maid,btohqsg
People will still take these orders.,btohqsg
Anyway the cash out for LLM usually is Wednesday 12am be in or end of Wednesday kind?,btohqsg
He guys how long will the 70$ deposit be transferred into bank after deactivation of account,btohqsg
usually in the middle of the day,btohqsg
Return of the western union scammerâ€¦.lol,btohqsg
I don't think llm would care about it,btohqsg
Back in my original workplace (hosp),btohqsg
Guys check with you all ah,btohqsg
How come I see other country llm got additional door to door charge,btohqsg
Because people will still take the job even if shit price,btohqsg
Any advise where to park if deliver to mbs?,btohqsg
The 16% commission deduction is fake,btohqsg
Mine got deducted at about 18.47%,btohqsg
Received an order at $27.5 and only got back $22.42,btohqsg
Mbs is $14/hr. U tell customer go driveway collect from u,btohqsg
Do until shag   why bother this type?  Each box is like 20-30kg. Even banglah may not want to do. Obviously need another helper. Cb want tekan ppl till go hospital this type. Those big boxes best 2 ppl load up the van.  Take care of spine. Don't bcos of such ppl sustain a perm injury,btohqsg
They still told me they book the same yesterday,btohqsg
Same story and excuses they give.  Even they did maybe the driver in hospital now. Not worth risk your health. All van drivers take care.  Don't because of small bucks lose your health.  Heard too much of such stories.  One time is enuf to suffer whole life due to back injury. Loading up van is different from lifting weights as slight turning of body maybe required.  Those turns can be lethal to lower back. Slowly   I seen women doing van job   she rolled big boxes up when I tried to help her,btohqsg
Yesterday I also kena like you  book MPV. But weight size is definitely 1.7M van type. So I negotiated with her ( China aunty ) to top extra $20 up to match 1.7M van pricing ( inclusive of surge ) as per on the app. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Donâ€™t hesitate to report on Foreign Workers working on delivery platforms. Just go ahead so that they donâ€™t abuse the platform and take any form of jobs.,btohqsg
I only reported 2  one of whom over the weekend. Infront of my face take motorcycle job. Straight away take photo of him holding his phone and his face. Then take photo of him running into his lorry with the delivery. Good luck to him.,btohqsg
Such cheapo customers still exist cos of cheapo drivers who condone their actions!,btohqsg
Guys I always ask for picAnd if the pic shows that you can't handle as one manIt's either they top up for additional manpower or cancelDon't get angry high bp over such Customer,btohqsg
Good luck and stay safe man,btohqsg
Tot only car and below need go up and take from cust,btohqsg
Door to door according to lala,btohqsg
