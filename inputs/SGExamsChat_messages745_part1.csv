Eh talk abt supportive senior sia,btohqsg
ah unlucky i got A div,btohqsg
ur sch near tanjong rhu right,btohqsg
Wah nowadays when i text my sch football chat they go react with the palestine flag like bruh,btohqsg
Is it cos they know you don’t support Palestine,btohqsg
Or like every message (regardless of who sent) they also do that,btohqsg
Wait so those from other ppl they don’t?,btohqsg
If yes it’s likely cos of this,btohqsg
Wait just to be clear I said don’t so you mean yes right,btohqsg
they don't do it to others but only to me,btohqsg
I can’t understand what’s their thinking,btohqsg
I think they think hamas is part of palestine,btohqsg
So they’re just misinformed I guess  confusing the state with the country,btohqsg
idk what they learn from their imams lah,btohqsg
cuz technically hamas also kinda represents palestine govt,btohqsg
Unfortunately polls show most Palestinians support them,btohqsg
Polls also shows that North Korean leader has strong support from his people too,btohqsg
Cos even if Hamas does fked up  stuff they just need to win over the minds of their citizens,btohqsg
100% support. In the ballot paper there’s only one choice,btohqsg
I was kind of shocked North Korea actually has elections lol,btohqsg
true lah  if not executed alr,btohqsg
Even if they spoil the ballot in protest they’re probably gonna be tracked down somehow and executed,btohqsg
he who wins writes the history books,btohqsg
it is the same thing hee hee,btohqsg
i contribute nothing but palestine hate to the convo today,btohqsg
Yeah that’s why I think as randkmdkd said it’s important to distinguish between the state and the people there,btohqsg
I mean that's why we should make History a compulsory subject and expand the scope to include historiography,btohqsg
rly random qns but was there ever a 3rd flavour? cuz i swear i rmbr tht there was 3 flavours,btohqsg

Did you see the moving things,btohqsg
but can you take H1 maths and fmaths,btohqsg
H2 math is assumed knowledge for fmath,btohqsg
one being entirety of h2 math is assumed knowledge for fm,btohqsg
Even priv alvl have to take h2 math with fmath,btohqsg
"Also iirc h1 subj isnt counted as a ""real"" subj by UK unis",btohqsg
What’s the point sia. As if the hot weather only happens on Mondays,btohqsg
