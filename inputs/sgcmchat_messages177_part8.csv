"a ""build"" is a sketchy tune with pops and bangs",btohqsg
and a hideous aftermarket carplay system that works only if you punch the screen and pledge allegiance to the ccp,btohqsg
i mean a proper 1.4 golf built for power  but their pop and bangs also not intense lol,btohqsg
every upshift maybe one pop  every downshift maybe one or two,btohqsg
brother i hate to say this but,btohqsg
small cc engine and built for power,btohqsg
the amount of money thrown in,btohqsg
you can buy a proper sports car,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHAHA but road tax cheap mah. so if they want to build also cannot say much,btohqsg
we all have our own like preferences,btohqsg
but a 1.4 Scirocco still makes plenty of torque stock,btohqsg
brother now we having a normal convo then u trying to break up a argument,btohqsg
people having convo u just butt in,btohqsg
eh u all need to read the texts w/o having feelings eh,btohqsg
yall really more than sensitive yk,btohqsg
U oso damn aggressive to me 4 what,btohqsg
bro you start shit i warn uou,btohqsg
can take a fuck ton of power on stock internals,btohqsg
i think the only part of the yaris,btohqsg
is the inline three seems more like,btohqsg
a bit hard to start learning on,btohqsg
cos of how rare a inline three is,btohqsg
i think simply because it's a unique platform ba,btohqsg
but it makes amazing power  especially the corolla,btohqsg
you don't see stupid inline 3s with 270hp,btohqsg
rotaries have been around for awhile,btohqsg
but we do see inline 3s with crazy hp/weight ratio,btohqsg
it’s essentially a similar learning curve to rotary i mean,btohqsg
no i’m just getting lin involved in the convo,btohqsg
but that inline 3 already so highly stressed,btohqsg
i've seen some push 500+ hp on stock internals,btohqsg
ngl i think it still has a bit more to give,btohqsg
then some with light tunes  310ish hp the car piangs,btohqsg
maybe i’m looking at 600 with forged internals? but thats higher side of things,btohqsg
but the part im curious on,btohqsg
is if it still handles just as well,btohqsg
cos to me toyota has been making cars made to feel good while driving and not powerhouses as of now,btohqsg
but supposedly stock isn't as good  to autocross,btohqsg
yeah apologies@DogeMasterz  i accidentally deleted the convo by the other guy,btohqsg
i cant find the fb post,btohqsg
meant to delete only one message i accidentally press delete all,btohqsg
i mean it’s HP and not WHP,btohqsg
but when u take into terms what the car is it’s crazy,btohqsg
going to go ahead for e85 too,btohqsg
there comes a point where power doesn't matter,btohqsg
wonder if it's still dailyable with that kind of power/weight ratio,btohqsg
but stupid power builds are very neat,btohqsg
imagine trying to pull away from the lights gently,btohqsg
it’s neat in a way you’re finding out a true potential in a engine,btohqsg
i would compare it to the 4AGE  and the older 2JZ,btohqsg
