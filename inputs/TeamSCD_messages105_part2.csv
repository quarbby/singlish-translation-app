Is it good to change to the iridium one?,btohqsg
It would drop to 12 on acceleration. Then the car would have hesitation feeling,btohqsg
Main issue was my leaky exhaust and my iacv,btohqsg
Tps sensor calibration was also off,btohqsg
Drop in spoon ecu  basically a flashed ECU from spoon,btohqsg
Some ppl feel after tune save fuel,btohqsg
Yeah thought about it  but 2k plus just to do the ECU,btohqsg
For now it's running quite alright,btohqsg
Ya if Not why they spend million to r&d,btohqsg
Fc could be better but I can live with this,btohqsg
If ur engine is 95 tuned and u pump higher it doesnt mean better. Sometimes your ECU has to compensate if your engine temp or compression is not tuned for that ron. This will affect your FC,btohqsg
My car is ron 96. Between 95 and 97 i measure same fc so far.,btohqsg
The spoon ecu I doubt is tuned for 95... Previously on stock ecu  the car would feel like it lacked power when using 95,btohqsg
Also the ron100 I do feel like it's more responsive,btohqsg
you should be pumping nothing less than 98 haha,btohqsg
unless your tune has been adjusted for lower octane rating,btohqsg
Been using 98 or 100. The amount of times I pump 95 can count with 1 hand,btohqsg
great. no more 95/ 97 for you,btohqsg
The 97 I've yet to try,btohqsg
I think your worse fc may be due to: “now petrol cheap i can ENJOY MY VTEC”,btohqsg
Jb so far either petron100 or vpower racing,btohqsg
even for swift sport need minimum 98. specified on the fuel door,btohqsg
Never drove a swift sport before,btohqsg
The vtec I don't open so often la,btohqsg
yes should be high comp. 2.0NA but 200bhp.,btohqsg
Min 95 can but fun keep loot,btohqsg
No knocking sound should be ok,btohqsg
The low rpm sound quite nice,btohqsg
Bearing in mind ecu compensates to prevent literal knocking but this is already compromising performance,btohqsg
Whoever tuned the engine would be best to advise,btohqsg
My ecu can't be tuned.... Unless I install like a hondata,btohqsg
Then easy case  refer to manufacturers recommendations,btohqsg
Sometimes in the owner manual  sometimes on the petrol cap door,btohqsg
Some more after you upgrade  you get used to it then don't feel it anymore,btohqsg
Like when I went from stock to spoon  I could feel a difference. But now I don't remember what difference it was,btohqsg
Sg how fast we can go,btohqsg
Is not how fast  is how shiok the car makes you feel,btohqsg
Maybe I not into all this already haha,btohqsg
That means u are tired of it already,btohqsg
Need to one day own another car,btohqsg
buyers are making it possible too haha,btohqsg
Woah. You mean fd2r was 7k depre previously ? Holy. Im new to the car scene and looking at the pricing of 7k vs at least 18k for fd2r now. Woah.,btohqsg
jing tian de gui  shi ming tian de pian yi,btohqsg
I was still looking around at fn and fd. lol. Thinking about how long i need to save up to change to a fd. lol. But now then you mentioned it was 7k...,btohqsg
I totally didnt know it was 7k,btohqsg
When i bought my fit last year  it was at 7.8k depre. I already felt reasonable. My friend even said 7.8k depre still quite high. Now i look at the second hand market. Fit going on for 10k depre. dafug.,btohqsg
Come guys COE was not 104k previously,btohqsg
Its not hype its market forces,btohqsg
