Now I know that whatever excess he has apart from FRS  he can withdraw freely after 55 from SA/oa.Question is does that also include the money I transferred to him..,btohqsg
Yes. Contactless and Online works for me.,btohqsg
The mode of payment doesn't factor in the discussion  as whether a transaction falls into the chosen category is determined by MCC not mode of payment,btohqsg
My bad  I guess the eligibility of this is similar to RSTU to spouse.,btohqsg
Hi all experts. Which card is more worth for daily spending OCBC Rewards Card or Infinity CC?I need to pay ntuc insurance but I think both card won’t offer any promo.. my monthly spending is about 500 and won’t be more than 550note: I have uob one acc with 500 spend every month so looking for another card for spending,btohqsg
Depends on your daily spending pattern. If you can make most of those transactions fall under the 4mpd categories of rewards card  then it is better. If not  then infinity is better.But in any case  you're comparing a specialised spend miles card vs a general spend cashback card  so it's not really a clean comparison.,btohqsg
I see. Can I confirm the miles is must tag into amaze or anything to earn?,btohqsg
You must match the bonus categories criteria to get the 4mpdhttps://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tnc-titaniumrewards-creditcard-programme-wef-1nov23.pdf,btohqsg
Charge your daily spending to ocbc credit  card n charge your NTUC insurance to UOB Evol/One credit card with min $500 to get uob one bonus interest.,btohqsg
hmmm ntuc insurance can charge to uob1 cc? 🤔,btohqsg
U try n kena reject before?,btohqsg
Only health one can. The rest first premium only. Similar to GE  only some can for renewals  some first premium only.,btohqsg
wooo... for a moment tot finally can charge for my life recurrent monthly insurance policy premium hahaha so still no choice on giro,btohqsg
OA to spouse SA is reserved  unlike self OA-SA is unreserved funds,btohqsg
SoIn a way he will still be able to withdraw the excess as he have his own Oa to SA transferred funds and also the mandatory contribution from his employer in SA.,btohqsg
Except for the ones you transferred or self top-up via RSTU,btohqsg
Paying SP services bill  phone and electricity bill through UOB Evol card is counted as eligible transaction to qualify for 600 sgd monthly spend ?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword “Evol sp”  “Evol phone”  “Evol electricity” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Use Uob one for sp services. 4.3% cash rebate,btohqsg
Hi CIMB floating mortgage rate*3.95%*  lock in till this Sep.Want to do partial prepayment to avoid high interest but downside is *investment opportunity cost* in near future & interest rate *negotiation* when loan renew.I thought of equity refinancing too for opportunity cost but not good because of long processing time  3months.How to circumvent the situation? Thanks,btohqsg
For CRMC  what does “Adjusted Points earned this month” refer to?,btohqsg
Probably for the mishap that happened last month from 19-22 Jan?,btohqsg
Too many unknown factors like your financial situation and potential liabilities. No info on your risk appetite and investment strategy. Suggest you consult a fees based financial adviser to make a calculated decision.No way to circumvent the 3 month wait for equity term loan processing.,btohqsg
i did similiar to you but only receive the delay notification for Human A on the flash deal (no news for the christmas promo). Human B did not receive any notification. is it the same for you?,btohqsg
I didn’t get any notification on the voucher delay. Haha.,btohqsg
Not to worry. As long as u held over 15 days and u click start challenge and claimed challenge. I don’t see any issue to get what u deserve. Notwithstanding our investment already made a (small) profit + rewards from credit cards.Alls good.,btohqsg

Hi  can i check OCBC 365 card has 6% cashback on fuel spend at Petrol stations. If I buy other stuff at petrol station  6% also applicable right haha,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know when T-bills open? I saw the date is 7 Feb but I login Posb internet banking  under T-bills stated nothing available now,btohqsg
For UOB one cc  does spending on guardian in JB clocks the 10-15% Cashback? Considering the FX spread  still worth it right?,btohqsg
Topup 4k and get back 8k in less than 1 month? That's double profit sia,btohqsg
Suspect that’s why we didn’t suffer loss. The payout included the distribution.,btohqsg
I think people will sell house sell car sell kidney leverage max all-in if that works,btohqsg
