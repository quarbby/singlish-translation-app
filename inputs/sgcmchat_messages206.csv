what's the difference between a powerslide and a drift uh ?,btohqsg
powerslide is when the car got power then slide,btohqsg
drift is when the car drifts away from it’s trajectory,btohqsg
js nice i in tele HAHAHA,btohqsg
nvm nothing already Hahaha rayyan came to the rescue,btohqsg
powersliding is having the rear end stepping out on exit,btohqsg
drift is initiating the slide before the apex,btohqsg
basically if you have shit tyres on a rwd  you kick the rears out on exit it's a powerslide,btohqsg
but if you're having some opposite lock before the apex  that's technically a drift,btohqsg

Explain the horse on the back of the car,btohqsg
Both have the farrier logo on it,btohqsg
are you sure its not a tyyyouut logo?,btohqsg
I’m 100% sure is not a Toyota,btohqsg
Wow you called me blind when I saw it in person,btohqsg
I have no idea what the price for one is like though,btohqsg
definitely not worth whatever they're selling it for,btohqsg
Likely is a Ferrari by looking at the rear defusser design,btohqsg

Car Spotters Ruleset (SCM)1) Do NOT share where the owner may park their car privately  & where they may live. Especially if you have information on where they do live.2) Do NOT uncover cars  or ask for the location of cars that should NOT be shared.3) Do NOT sit in a car or touch a car without the owners permission. This includes etiquette to not ask for a ride and asking to sit in the car (unless you know the owner well  or if they have asked you)You have all seen what happened at RetroHavoc regarding touching cars.4) Be aware of your surroundings. You are representing a passion and it does not call for irresponsible behaviour. Do NOT harass others for blocking your shots  block traffic  be inconsiderate to the public or endanger your own life. Do NOT scream & shout in public & cause disturbance to the public.5) Respect the owners wishes. Do blur out plates when sharing. Do NOT ask to rev cars  especially do NOT yell at them for a rev.6) Do NOT share incriminating videos online  i.e. hard launches  speeding & so on. The legal implications on a owner can be serious and also cause a owner’s pride & joy to be impounded. For the media to be shared around negatively will also be detrimental to this community as a whole.7) Do NOT run after cars  especially in unsafe environments or crowds. Running for a Lamborghini is not worth getting hit by a taxi or running into a child. You will cause stress and affect more people  and look stupid to people as an added benefit.8) Do NOT ask for contacts regarding car owners from others. Respect the owners privacy & don’t expect everyone to be friends with you just because you have an interest in their car.Those reported to be breaking these rules are subjected to a ban or warning dependent on the severity of the offence.,btohqsg
"> asks what it is> ""i do"" when asked if they knew about the make",btohqsg
i jst frgt what isit abt,btohqsg
W? I bought this for 30 sgd whole set,btohqsg
imo not much value to most ppl,btohqsg
but wtv makes u happy bro,btohqsg
Bro felt special for delivering his message 0.00004 seconds before me 😭,btohqsg
“what is this”“i know what it is”,btohqsg
most of them are like $2-5 last time i saw,btohqsg
BRO I KNOW WHAT IT IS ITS JUST I CAN'T REMEMBER EVEN THOUGH I DO,btohqsg
BRO TRUST ME BRO I KNOW BRO,btohqsg
BRO ALPINA YEAH THEY MAKE THOSE RENAULT CAR THINGS,btohqsg
Honda city vs all of them,btohqsg

Is it better to have livery just on the sides and leave the front and back plain or just send it and have full wrapped liveries,btohqsg
I edited a livery i had in mind for my ride . you guys think it's better to leave the back empty or no ? Thanks for your feedbacks in advance 🙏🏽,btohqsg
do the back if you're doing this,btohqsg
else it would love neither here nor there,btohqsg
From ur design is good  but i think the car need a respray too,btohqsg
either black or white would offset your design,btohqsg
the dimensions are a bit odd,btohqsg
it’s just weird to see a big skull,btohqsg
also looking for alternatives instead of skeletons,btohqsg
get a proper designer to make you a livery based on what you love,btohqsg
Probably a full rose would looks good too if u looking for alternative  and since there are roses around already,btohqsg
yea i got inspiration mainly from a corvette on google that i saw   and partially believe it or not from some disney movie,btohqsg
i was thinking like a logo   maybe a bmw logo but it dont seem to fit,btohqsg
I've seen some on the roads,btohqsg
based on what u like is best,btohqsg
if you want a fun livery,btohqsg
the BASF M1 can serve as inspiration too,btohqsg
Or could go with the retro f1 livery,btohqsg
those are some great ideas thanks,btohqsg
this is niche too  would suit a white car.,btohqsg
"part of me suddenly came up to do a gta livery .. fkin cruising around with "" ubermacht "" on it everywhere",btohqsg
yea indeed. thanks for the ideas,btohqsg

man was on the shoulder of SLE twd BKE this morning,btohqsg
poor dude broke both his axles  must have tried to jump his car,btohqsg
Could be Air suspension burst. Once that happens all 4 wheels falls to the ground. Can't move,btohqsg
actually thats plausible  he might have lost pressure on his system and deflated all 4 corners. Which would explain why he is driving his car around fully slammed trying to limp home,btohqsg
given the age/value of his car i am guessing he bought a pretty cheap air suspension system,btohqsg
Cheap and air suspension don't go tgt,btohqsg
we shd bag a 1000rm wira for shits and giggles,btohqsg
the first time airing it up the strut mounting points break from all the rust under,btohqsg
But authentic te37 sagas on a proton saga.,btohqsg
