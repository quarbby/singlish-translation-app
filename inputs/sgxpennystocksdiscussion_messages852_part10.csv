Oil prices up 3% on worries about Middle East supplieshttps://ift.tt/cXvnBV5October 28  2023 at 06:16AM,btohqsg
Tat time said earth will go into reset mode if WW3 start and is  from middle east... When Russia Ukraine go to war thinking heng ar not middle east.. Now sianzz liao.. Èí±ËøòÊ≤°Ëä±ÂÆåüò≠,btohqsg
I suspect alien attack will come first,btohqsg
I dare n say so much on race n religion. But those gang up are forever the underdogs who cannot win in gentleman fight,btohqsg
Later go spend lar .  1 day can spend finish Liao üòÇ,btohqsg
Cannot finish de lah.. Buy rex lorüòÇ,btohqsg
Enjoy wkend don worry.. if really needs to worry.. let's worry for tOhishüêÜ next wkü§£,btohqsg
Buy 2 Ferrari finished Liao .,btohqsg
I think there already has been a running joke about Ukraine being used to clear old munition stocks already.I seriously wouldn't want to go up against the US military-industrial complex. After all  it was their industry that won them both world war 1 and 2.,btohqsg
It takes time to build new weaponry stock so if China n Russia can deplete some of US‚Äôs stock US will have less weapons to fight possible wars on so many fronts against China Russian North Korea etc etc then how to defend Israel Japan Taiwan n South Korea etc. Communists against the free world,btohqsg
Just the party name lol. Personally  they should have changed it.,btohqsg
China history hated US & japan..Russia hated US & Japan too,btohqsg
China done alot great thing to e world.. Imagine they can change desert to green.. So far what US do? Except to destroy mankind,btohqsg
I think it still is at least the leadership,btohqsg
Just for e name still communist but then they open e door to e world unlike N. Korea,btohqsg
Prior to XJP maybe. They had to open to the world follow like Singapore bcos the country was bankrupt if citizens too poor would have civil rebellion against the ccp,btohqsg
Many ppl hated XJP but infact to Buddhism  he is Buddha come to save world,btohqsg
Juz urging common ppl to take a good read about the history of China and US.. U will probably find who's the evil antagonist at the expense of world peace.. And who hv nvr wage war on foreign countries in history.. Dun believe the mainstream media too much ya üôèüòâ,btohqsg
Not really. It doesn't want to abandon the old ways completely because they are afraid of their lower class that brought them to power. If it revolts they are in troubleSo it keeps stuff like the name  acts like it will take care of EVERYone especially with the policies. But it's more like a mostly capitalistic autocracy with communist sounding overtones. The poor people have been more screwed than ever.,btohqsg
How you are so sure it was ownself bombed own hospital?,btohqsg
No news can be trusted anymore these days lol. It's all propaganda. I have no idea what the truth is.,btohqsg
I saw the video church issued in Malaysia. You want link I try to find it,btohqsg
I cannot agree this propaganda line of narrative too lah when I see how internally their citizens suffered throughout history through all the dynasties,btohqsg
When I find it I post here bcos got it a few days ago the church letter with video link,btohqsg
which part shows ownself bombed own hospital?,btohqsg
There's nothing here that is proof of anything. Just what someone says. While it is possible that it wasn't the Israelis  no one will know for sure at this point since it's a warzone and no truly independent analysis can be carried out on site,btohqsg
No idea what you've said here.,btohqsg
It's not for peace either... For oily and resources. They won't be there if there's no benefit. Not to forget which western country forced China open so they could sell Opium to the population,btohqsg
Ya lah but it was not the Israelites who started this right?,btohqsg
The irony is that today the US has a fetanyl problem. And apparently most of the ingredients are being sourced from China for it's manufacture in Mexico. The US is trying to ask China to control the export of those chemicals,btohqsg
That would depend on how you look at it ba. The conflict has been ongoing for ages. If people are not desperate and angry  will they turn into terrorists instead of having a decent job and life?,btohqsg
Hamas aim is just to eliminate Israel not matter how they do it. Anyway let‚Äôs leave it at this. ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
That's the narrative. Would Hamas easily find recruits if Palestinian could have a decent life?,btohqsg
Who would choose such a life over a normal one,btohqsg
It started all at genesis times ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
New world very difficult to tell who is actually telling the truth,btohqsg
"If we are talking about the same subject  then yr statement should be on the same subject.. If u r saying this statement  then I can also say internal stuff stays internally.. This applies to every sovereign country.. No need some busybody to use the ""peace"" thingy to earn their monies n acting like a peacemaker ya.. Anyway this is my own perception.. So chill ya üòâ",btohqsg
Aiya in war  only the victor writes the truth.,btohqsg
