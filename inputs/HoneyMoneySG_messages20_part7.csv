Hi  anyone use instarem amaze caed with visa?,btohqsg
If i topup amaze wallet with visa  does the credit card count it as spending? For e.g using uob one.,btohqsg
Amaze can only pair with mastercard,btohqsg
You can topup amaze wallet using visa card,btohqsg
I Heard UOB has been excluded from CardUp payments and would not earn points  is that true??,btohqsg
Any promotional code to open RHB account?,btohqsg
Many card exclude AXS payment and utilities payment for bonus rewards.Personally I am using UOB absolute for utilities. 1.7% cash back.,btohqsg
uh  refer to their promo page lah,btohqsg
If you need the tax relief then better to do VCMA now. If no need then dosent matter,btohqsg
Question: I top up 8k for my parents CPF  can i still topup SA or MA for tax relief and by how much?,btohqsg
Was wondering if my dad earns more than 4K monthly  and I do voluntary top up of $8k his SA account  do I still get tax relief on this $8k? Because I see a $4k cap for spouse and siblings top up.‚ÄúTo qualify for tax relief for cash top-ups made to your spouse or siblings  they must not have an annual income of more than $4 000 in the year preceding the year of top-up (e.g. salary or tax-exempt income such as bank interest  dividends  and pension) or be handicapped.‚Äù,btohqsg
RSTU-SA 8K to parents only  thats on top of the 8k you can top-up to yourself,btohqsg
thanks chris. meaning i can topup 8k (max) to my MA?,btohqsg
and get additional 8k for the tax relief right ? thanks,btohqsg
CPF top up SRS and donation could be a hot topic for the next few weeks. üòÇ,btohqsg
Does it include UOB PRVI? I see that UOB PRVI doesn‚Äôt exclude,btohqsg
yea seems not excluded. Never tried though cause dun think worth the cardup fees to get the points.,btohqsg
Got a questions. Considering i have $75k-$100k savings in bank.1. Between UOB One Savings and OCBC 360  which earns the highest interest without fulfilling the $500 on credit card. (Salary  giro fullfill only),btohqsg
Assuming you have $100k in savings  OCBC 360 will give you $212 per year while UOB will give you $50 per year,btohqsg
both the websites have calculators u can use to find out yourself,btohqsg
What payment methods do you all use for hawker centre?,btohqsg
I got the values from the calculators,btohqsg
Assume I spend & giro I guess uob better,btohqsg
Amex pay use the universal QR code also?,btohqsg
Yes  just make sure Amex logo is there,btohqsg
ok thanks! i think no need tax relief for now.,btohqsg
I hope UOB or OCBC come out with a mastercard instead of visa. Heavy usage on amaze card linking directly with mastercard. Currently both uob one and ocbc 360 is VISA. Hence cant hit minimum $500 if spend in Singapore only.,btohqsg
Still looking for alternatives. Uob lady mastercard only for ladies.,btohqsg
Amex pay only for Ames issues not uob Amex ya it's accept SGQR,btohqsg
No more discounts on nestia yeah.,btohqsg
Amex pay is the last options,btohqsg
Does Liquidpay count as online/contactless for 4MPD for HSBC Revo?,btohqsg
amex pay can earn what ah.grab pay still got 1.7% Cashback from topup from UOB AMEX + chance at 25k coins.,btohqsg
paying direct with Amex TCB (not sure if UOB Abs Cashback has it)  at least wont have funds stuck inside Grabpay..,btohqsg
Only applies to amex pay via amex app,btohqsg
Only 1.5 from amex TCB not from grabGrab Already nerf into oblivion,btohqsg
Grab still good to pay for insurance and AXS transactions paired with UOB Amex.,btohqsg
Uob amex user still can top up grab eaen 1.7 to use grab to SgQRWhen grab and Amex Nerf top up benefitsThe amex issues card can use amex pay via amex pay is the lasts resortUob amex will be left to nonna,btohqsg
LiquidPay  like Amaze  converts transactions to online,btohqsg
If no more 1.7 if u use top up to grab uob amex will be wasted,btohqsg
Feel amex issue usercwill have last laughs when grab & amex no morei Cashback when top up so uob amex wioll affect the mostBut Ames issued user still can use sGQR,btohqsg
If amex grab no more can use what other cc recommend to pay insurance,btohqsg
They also slow in giving back the cash back. Amex is same mth give back,btohqsg
Yes I haven‚Äôt see my UOB Cashback,btohqsg
I was not aware when I apply for the cash. Cuz Gian the extra 0.2%,btohqsg
Now like not worth the effort lol,btohqsg
UOB Stash would give you around 500++ per year without the need for salary,btohqsg
Might as well go for Singlife or SIF GoSavers in that case. $1500 and $2500 respectively,btohqsg
Uob amex other than grab pay top up seem like no other use case,btohqsg
Agree... Once it is nerfed... I will cancel uob amex,btohqsg
