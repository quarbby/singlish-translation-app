🚀Pika World Markets Update - 2 April 2024🚀Equity markets pared off their early pre-markets gain to close lower  while Nasdaq managed to eke out a tiny gain of 0.1% during the last 10 minutes of trading.💸It was a volatile session  especially as traders returned to their desks after a long weekend while digesting last Friday's PCE data and Monday's ISM Manufacturing readings.🎲The conclusion is clear: the economy is resilient  and the Federal Reserve has little reason to ease monetary policy given the solid economic activities. The bond market is quick to reflect this narrative. We saw the 10-year Treasury yield rise sharply by over 0.1%  mounting on major equities to deliver a green day. The rise in the yield sharply dented small and medium-caps stocks  with Russell 2000 taking the lead in the fall.💰During the start of the year  major corporations took advantage of the lower interest rates to issue new bonds. This comes as investors' appetite for high-quality bonds was high. Such bonds yielded 5.36%  a drop from 6.44%  which effectively means a cheaper borrowing cost for companies.📪What's on the menu today?📤1) At 10 pm  we will receive the Factory Orders (MoM) for February. At the same time  the JOLTs Jobs Opening data will be released. We need to see a slight cooling to ensure that inflation can be tamed.2) Between 10.10 pm and 1.30 am  we have a string of FOMC speakers  from Bowman to Williams  Mesters  and Daly  which may become a volatile session.It is Tuesday  2 April  8.55 am in Singapore and 8.55 pm in New York. With the rising volatility  traders took profit off the table and re-assessed the outlook ahead  paring down the odds of a rate cut in June. This also comes as we will be ushering in a new earnings season.We hope all our friends have a splendid day at work and in school.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
