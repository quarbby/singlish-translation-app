but if there’s nobody to blame then how do i justify my experience,btohqsg
He said it during yesterday lecture,btohqsg

It's the right time to learn actions have consequences,btohqsg

How about you choose me instead,btohqsg
All that talk but you aint been into my room at night >:(,btohqsg
I would but I chose Si Yan and unfortunately he's still rejecting me,btohqsg
no matter how much you hear from others you will never truly know how your experience will go unless you experience it,btohqsg
So I am sticking to my choices rn bro even if I get no reciprocal love :(,btohqsg
so in this case there really isn’t anyone to blame,btohqsg
it’s more of it is what it is when it comes to things you can’t do anything about,btohqsg
from the way it sounds  its more that mi wasnt suitable for her. mi’s teaching pedagogy is optimised for a certain group of students and she didnt fall in that group,btohqsg
tldr i went to mi with the assumption that my experience there would be better than yi but ended up being disappointed because mi wasn’t suited for me,btohqsg
Hi is it better to take a course in food and beverage at nyp or hotel and leisure management at np?,btohqsg
