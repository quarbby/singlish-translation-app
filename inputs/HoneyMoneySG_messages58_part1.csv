90k in RA does not meet the FRS or BRS for 2023. With plans to shielding you not able to withdraw money from SA after 55. @65  CPF will push funds from SA/OA to RA again if you have not meet FRS by 65.,btohqsg
It's now 8k to self 8k for loved ones. No split to any accounts as long the accounts have not reach the ceiling,btohqsg
But i ask to the cardup service center they reply the evol cc still can earn 0.3% rewards,btohqsg
"uh  based on the uob evol TnC  under definition of ""Transaction""  ""any payment of funds to payment service provider"" is excluded. As such it does not count to ""at least $600 worth of Transactions"".Anyway  u can do what u deem fit. Just that what Cardup service centre say counts to nothing in case u did not clock the minimum spend and did not get your rebate.",btohqsg
Can I confirm for those on Apr-Jul HSBC EGA cycle  we should withdraw on 1Aug right.. since no more promo to recycle to,btohqsg
Can Citigold Fixed deposits made during their promo (3.68%) rolled over upon maturity to another FD at prevailing rates? or are their published rates only a one-time thing for new bank owners?,btohqsg
Even if it‚Äôs 8k for self and 8k for loved ones  the tax relief is still capped at 8k or 16k?,btohqsg
Is there anyone here still involved in the ftx n hodlnaut claims?Can someone make a video?Since y'all did recommended the platform initially  not blaming but at least would be good to do a video to explain the situation n how we can claims too,btohqsg
Hi Have the group explore buying US treasury etf likeiShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF?,btohqsg
Just now already double confirm with cardup  the spending is valid,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I just open a cimb fast saver. Just transfer money in will enjoy 3.5% correct? Does it matter if I'm existing credit card holder or need to be new member?,btohqsg
Note that CardUp / iPayMy have been known to be wrong. And they take no responsibility for it. When discrepancies arise  their usual answer is to ask you to check with the bank.,btohqsg
hello  wanna check for EGA bonus 1%  it‚Äôs from the 6 transaction onwards or after i completed 5 eligible transaction they will slowly credit me for all? call centre tell me one thing and the online chat tell me 2 different things..,btohqsg
if im not wrong  it is after u clock the requirements then they start giving uI might be wrong though,btohqsg
yeah so it means that it‚Äôs the 6th eligible transaction onwards eh? super weird mechanic,btohqsg
their cashback is given on a ad hoc basis 1  i noticed that once the transaction cleared  they will just give u back the rewardsso i think it makes more business sense for them haha. but their validity period is quite long though.,btohqsg
yah sadly i did some big purchases on my first 2 transactions thinking that all will be eligible after the 5th one is completed ü•≤ i ask them for appeal they say they don‚Äôt have any avenue for appeal,btohqsg
bo bian  if u are using advance  probably can get 1.5% though,btohqsg
U can just transfer in2k on first day of the month then transfer out 5 paynow to fulfill the criteria before u do spending,btohqsg
I do so to mak sure all criteria is hit before i do any spending as i have all my bank cc giro to hsbc ega to enjoy the 1 percent off giro bill payment,btohqsg
yeah thanks for advice! will do so starting aug üòä,btohqsg
Oh shoot  I didn‚Äôt know the timing of the 5 transactions to clock matters. I always thought our entire (eg. July) month of cc transactions will be entitled to +1% as long we fulfil the July month criteria of 5 trxn + $2k transfer,btohqsg
You're talking about when the transaction is made right? The transaction must be posted to be eligible iirc.,btohqsg
Ic okay. I mean I thought any transactions made before the 5 transactions are completed  will still be entitled for the +1% as long it all got posted within the same month üò¨,btohqsg
Hi  i will be purchasing product from AudioHouse for my renovation and payments need to be made in full. Is there any credit card which can help to earn miles with no monthly capping?,btohqsg
yes  this is correct  it carry from the previous month,btohqsg
Use kris+ to pay and pair with UOB Krisflyer - uncapped 3 mpd from uob kf + 1 mpd from kris+,btohqsg
Are you sure UOB krisflyer gives 3mpd for Audio House purchases? UOB krisflyer 3mpd (provided you spend $800 annually on SIA  Scoot  KrisShop) is only applicable to a whitelisted list of merchants. I do not think Audio House is in that list.,btohqsg
It is 3 mpd for Kris+ transactions. Kindly read TnC,btohqsg
Can kris+ use with DBS women for 4mpd or Citi miles ?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc shd be ok. Citi rewards no coz it's considered in-app.,btohqsg
Hi  I applied for the UOB prvi miles card and im trying to fulfill the $1000 spend for 2 months to get the sign up bonus. Does anyone know if payments made via the Kris+ app to valid merchants (Merchant MCC not part of the exclusion list) count toward the $1000 spend? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
My apologies. I didn't realize Audio House was a Kris+ merchant.,btohqsg
shouldnt be an issue. i had used my kris+ app to make payment to The White Tiffin. UOB had confirmed to me that this restaurant is not part of the exclusion.,btohqsg
they had checked via the mcc,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice. But I think kris + has nerf the earn rate to 1milea per dollar from May 2023 onwards,btohqsg
Use titanium. It‚Äôs not capless but it‚Äôs up to 13k+ per card (26k for 2 cards). That should suffice,btohqsg
yes but UOB Krisflyer hasn't nerfed and it's uncapped so at least there's still that,btohqsg
I can sense a particular pooh bear from this message üêª,btohqsg
Yes for DBS WWMC . Citi Miles take note it won't be treated as online (im not sure u mean Citi PM or CRMC),btohqsg
still 1 bonus miles on top of the 3mpd-6mpd on the CC,btohqsg
Hi guys What's the best credit card to link with Shopback app to earn some rewards?Or actually there's no reward if link credit card to Shopback app? Haha,btohqsg
Follows the shop's underlying MCC if i remember correctly.,btohqsg
dbs wwmc yes. If u meant citi rewards mc  need to pair with Amaze to be eligible for 4mpd on kris+.,btohqsg
online cards or categorical cards for the merchant MCC,btohqsg
Nope  no 10x points for that mcc,btohqsg
a Qualifying Charge made at an online retail merchant  excluding *mobile wallet* andtravel-related transactions*Not sure mobile-wallet is referring to app like Shopback ?,btohqsg
no  refers to online/in-app payment using google/samsung/apple pay,btohqsg
DBS Live Fresh & UOB Evol for cashback.,btohqsg
if i pay for my insurance using axs with hsbc revo  does it eligible for cashback ? or is there any credit card strategy to pay for insurance and get cashback,btohqsg
