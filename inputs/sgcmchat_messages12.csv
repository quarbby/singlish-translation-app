What car do you usually drive. I'm curious,btohqsg
Err im a drifter so anyth from the VDC pack?,btohqsg
I mostly drift WDTS 180sx and had been driving it for 1.5 years,btohqsg
I only drift competitive cars in Shibuya or Ebisu Minami,btohqsg
Usually i drift custom mods tho,btohqsg
I don't think I can download anymore cars lmao... fr i have close to 800 cars now,btohqsg
I js make my own HAHA,btohqsg
I js store all my mods in my HDD so i can js keep downloading,btohqsg
Are you racing DMVC this year?,btohqsg
I wish but not a fan of competitive drifting,btohqsg
I'd join if SG had one xD,btohqsg
There r sm cross events in singapore no?,btohqsg
I think they r more private tho,btohqsg
Im not big in touge stuff but i think you need a EDMJ license or a MSC irl?,btohqsg
Eh but i think ESDA oso can,btohqsg
I have VDC Riga map and istg  I cannot get into the clipping zone,btohqsg
Issok la js whack a few times here and there,btohqsg
Furthermore I got no handbrake atm and still sticking with old school drifting,btohqsg
Usually i dun rlly use my handbrake but depends on what ur doing,btohqsg
When will ur wheel be back?,btohqsg
They said that the hub will come by July 15,btohqsg
Iirc I'm also planning to get Thrustmaster set or Fanatec in the future to replace this G920,btohqsg
Coz the motor inside the servo doesn't really sounds good... got a lot of drag,btohqsg
Oh i actually got the fanatec csl E and its q ok,btohqsg
The DD has too much catch for my transitions,btohqsg
Yeah. Iirc a set of fanatec is around $4k while Thrustmaster is around $2k,btohqsg
Actually i got it as a gift lololol,btohqsg
But oni thr wheelbase the rest i had to save,btohqsg
This year I'm actually planning to just play sim racing games. Coz I just don't feel like playing any other games since I'm already working full time,btohqsg
Anyone wanna organize a drive to malacca?,btohqsg
We do it like drive there then stay hotel then go do activities,btohqsg
Must take pic with this boat its tradition,btohqsg
Thats what i did haha! But actually one day can settle all activities next day just chill brunch then drive back,btohqsg
There's an RX8 meet up in malaysia right?,btohqsg
ofc want go msia must have $$ in the first place to play whatü§£,btohqsg
Eh thought now no more wfh alr,btohqsg
Morning and afternoon can forget it man unless its like cars and coffee where wife and kid can go sit and eat,btohqsg
Mostly it will be spotters who are free that timing,btohqsg
if we were to change location to somewhere like dempsey hill would it better for yall or no?,btohqsg
U jio some random carpark in the daytime  we sit around cook in the sun meh,btohqsg
okok  ill discuss with the other organisers,btohqsg
only drivers vote please thank you,btohqsg
Damn why Hari Raya Haji ü§î,btohqsg
Oh yea. That would make a lot of ppl cannot make it,btohqsg
Yeah but not all people working,btohqsg
im gna need to rediscuss with others then,btohqsg
You change here change there no one will come in the end,btohqsg
It just show that ur side is not planning this properly,btohqsg
ngl you could have jst stick to sat ah cuz like it doesnt matter oso if some ppl cnnt make it  for those who can then theyd come ah,btohqsg
but if u keep changing the dates people who schedule to be free on that day oso like sian yk,btohqsg
If u make Sunday if they dowan come they won‚Äôt,btohqsg
i think jst keep it sunday morning la at this point,btohqsg
jst let them be ah   if they come then they come lor   plus isokay if got not alot of cars,btohqsg
as long got few cars its already a meet,btohqsg
These hints are actually useless  at this point,btohqsg
okay thanks for the advice guys,btohqsg
iskeh la   whatever it is so long got car then okay la,btohqsg
see how this sunday meet goes out,btohqsg
then next time me and the organisers learn from it,btohqsg
If got good cars thr maybe not for the meet,btohqsg
Cuz Dempsey sometimes got the crew go the and chill,btohqsg
ig if they wanna join the meet its up to them,btohqsg
Maybe the other can look out eh,btohqsg
they chill there usually at what time tho,btohqsg
Maybe before 11 they go alr,btohqsg
Unless legit cars and coffee ppl come,btohqsg
Who's the organizer for the meet?,btohqsg
basically the admins in this gc and a few others,btohqsg
im one of them ah  another one driving hiace,btohqsg
Hmm.... they need to really make up their mind to plan. Don't like last minute change or cancel,btohqsg
we gna keep it on sunday at dempsey,btohqsg
Only timing is a bit of a problem. That's all,btohqsg
I think not many also will come,btohqsg
Cuz pa at few week lots of meets,btohqsg
Then now covid gg up agn,btohqsg
Steady a bit. When planning u need to put yourself in driver shoes. Most driver married or got family one. Working adult. The hari raya thing i also nv thought of it until someone said,btohqsg
That being said ur first one dont worry so much just go,btohqsg
yea we gna see the turn out then we will improve from there,btohqsg
I can make it on sat,btohqsg
Then u can learn from the recent one which was ‚Äúmessy‚Äù but actually i thought was ok.,btohqsg
Location change the fact is very hard to control,btohqsg
But organizer have to engage drivers if not whats the point,btohqsg
I also ask one gtr owner if he can on sat then he say can but he say sun he can‚Äôt alr,btohqsg
Like roi said  it just feels like spotter org photoshoot for their convenience,btohqsg
I thought this is like channel for car meet,btohqsg
Ya lah  car meet is not going to be priority one. The best u can do is middle of the night usually,btohqsg
Skali they organise their own meet,btohqsg
My objective will be to gather all the purples for a photo,btohqsg
That itself will present a unique challenge,btohqsg
Ur car not full purple ü§£,btohqsg
why did i put that option sia,btohqsg
Should have known it would be popular,btohqsg
Purple car meet confirm shiok. Admire the purple gang,btohqsg
So he can go Blu and purple meet,btohqsg
Agreed. Usually cant make everything perfect for everyone to join in de. But is up to you to see how to plan it for most ppl to make it lor,btohqsg
who the one that ask to change,btohqsg
Unless make it at night or smthing,btohqsg
then Hari Raya I need go ppl have,btohqsg
I commented it shld be at a carpark with something to do if daytime  but i didnt say the day though.,btohqsg
He Jio his friend fd2r  mk7r  Evo x and the gtr,btohqsg
I ask them drop by on sun but they gg jb so can‚Äôt,btohqsg
Go jb during hari raya weekend ah,btohqsg
Ah yes  the ‚Äúif we go 3 am sure no ppl‚Äù self scam,btohqsg
I have done this to myself before,btohqsg
I reach sg side customs 3:30 am,btohqsg
I come out malaysia side 8 am,btohqsg
So u believe now not relevant?,btohqsg
Ask them post ig story k,btohqsg
U the guai one let cars go in all that right,btohqsg
What is called guai let cars go in all that,btohqsg
Were u in my car to say that,btohqsg
2019 grandfather  u 3 years 2 generations,btohqsg
b4 covid ofc a lot la,btohqsg
Ya ya now no car one,btohqsg
Hari raya weekend suuuuure no jam,btohqsg
U going with them or not,btohqsg
Lmao legit ah. Organise car meet but no car? ü§£,btohqsg
I thought majority voted to keep,btohqsg
10am meet for what. Suntan ah. I‚Äôm out,btohqsg
honestly nothing wrong to organise a car meet without owning a car. you can be a car enthusiast without owning one.,btohqsg
Hi can I ask   so sat change to sun then 10am to ? Any time ?,btohqsg
10 am sat abit too early ah lol,btohqsg
Sun I mean sun to have üåû,btohqsg
U wanted to gather at a carpark in the daytime that has nothing around it?,btohqsg
Meet at ecp or dempsey ppl can go macs  go brunch  take shelter,btohqsg
And fyi i didnt say anything about the when  only the where,btohqsg
Ya this one jam till v bad,btohqsg
I kenna stuck also. End up at tuas side take 4h+ to clear also,btohqsg
@k4gesdont stress over the first attempt bro. But take in the feedback,btohqsg
all good bro  if you guys have any feedback pls feel free to dm me,btohqsg
Night is safest la. But if u want the daytime ones  the cars and coffee formula works,btohqsg
i want to create a inclusive meet for everyone to enjoy  but clearly im not ready yet and neither are the other admins  thus id appreciate if you guys have any feedback,btohqsg
next time just settle on one day and time you think suitable then if people want come don't want come up to them,btohqsg
Night at a more accessible area perhaps?,btohqsg
Singaporeans will complain  but its during the bitching sessions that their true thoughts come out. Pros and cons,btohqsg
Asian style is not to complain directly to u,btohqsg
Ya there will just be genuine schedule clashes u cant cater to everyone,btohqsg
Actually mid day meet is okay,btohqsg
Cuz Sembawang Park nothing do there and so hot,btohqsg
Start of day will tend to have higher turn out cos ppl can go liao then proceed with the rest of their family day or whatever,btohqsg
Hence i said the cars and coffee formula is a working one,btohqsg
If Kallang Leisure mid day still okay,btohqsg
HDC does it too with their 8am meets,btohqsg
Let the admins regroup and replan üëç,btohqsg
Like the meet the rides is also mid day,btohqsg
Yea theres a reason for it,btohqsg
But abit paiseh eh no car organise meet,btohqsg
Ya can understand but I wouldn‚Äôt go more than once LOL absolutely not a morning person,btohqsg
Sun night wdl waterfront 9pm see y‚Äôall,btohqsg
Haha. With a kid its different ba. Getting up early with family is part of routine,btohqsg
@k4gesmay I know the story the admins,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs fair ah up to individual preference,btohqsg
Oh. Trust me getting up early is not the preference,btohqsg
Kids want to wake up early meh,btohqsg
Just saying its easier to wake up cos used to it,btohqsg
For a breakfast with family its fine,btohqsg
When single is wake up 2 pm,btohqsg
Maybe dating wake up 10 am go brunch,btohqsg
basically  when we started SCM me and a few others simply say that we want host meet if we reach 2k  then when we did we got plan then suddenly got a few complaints we all panicked  some admins were busy with irl stuff so we couldn‚Äôt communicate as much  so pretty much me and 1 other admin were planning this and thats when it all fell,btohqsg
Don't worry climb back up some day again,btohqsg
ah okay i dm u rq,btohqsg
pity u take the blame haha,btohqsg
nola issok man  it sucks but honestly its good to take criticism because it helps me learn for the future,btohqsg
but must work as team mah,btohqsg
if plan don‚Äôt work u can‚Äôt take the whole blame,btohqsg
Team work makes the dream work,btohqsg
yeah i know that  ive alr discuss with them and they learnt alr,btohqsg
This one legit is Â•ΩÂ≠©Â≠ê. Jiayous. Replan and then let us know again. The other car groups will support u if they can. üëç,btohqsg

Unless if u install the bluetooth system,btohqsg

Have you guys heard of bluetooth transmitter?,btohqsg
So i bought this bluetooth transmitter online,btohqsg
And connect it to the cigarette lighter socket,btohqsg
And set your non bluetooth radio to a frequency where there isnt any radio channel being telecast,btohqsg
And also set the frequency in the bluetooth transmitter same as the frequency u set in the car radio,btohqsg
Followed by connect your hp bluetooth to the bluetooth transmitter and it will play the songs from your to your car speaker,btohqsg
The evo maybe can restore tho,btohqsg
The rear ended and front wasnt badly damaged i guess but sad tho‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
