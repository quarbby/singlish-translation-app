So in other words  whether the organization is using mount E or raffles hospital that sort of thing,btohqsg
Most insurance covers Government by default but usually when u get company coverage the private ones get better service and are easier to get appointments,btohqsg
Iirc some even extend it to the family members,btohqsg
Some do but imo those are legit extremely expensive insurance which most MNCs won't bother,btohqsg
It's too much to just write off as a company perk lmao,btohqsg
Either way something I will take a look when I return to SG and do my job hunt,btohqsg
Since it is not sth that has to be done NOW  maybe i shld wait till i start working and then claim fr company,btohqsg
It's not written tho it's something u find during your negotiations with HR,btohqsg
But the thing im unclear is since im an existing patient of NDC  i dun need another referral letter from polyclinic? My dentist can auto refer me to the specialist department (?),btohqsg
Yes my mumâ€™s ex company hv plenty of family members coverage,btohqsg
Mmm usually I will assume that if its not written in the contract or company's guidelines  then probably it is not there,btohqsg
But some companies dental is under â€˜othersâ€™,btohqsg
Yeah basically something u will find out when u cross that bridge,btohqsg
So i dunnid care when my referral letter is expiring?,btohqsg
No need unless u plan to transfer out,btohqsg
My wisdom tooth causing me probs alr,btohqsg
In fact w an existing appointment  i can just push it back to when i want,btohqsg
Mine once did  i had to go to the dentist and they managed to force me in,btohqsg
NDC the slots are also damn hard to come by,btohqsg
The last time mine was unbearable paid $150 for meds and diligently took for 2 weeks..my teeth pain was gone,btohqsg
So I'll be surprised if u managed to push it back within the timeframe tbvh,btohqsg
But im hving existing dental appointments for other things alreadyâ€¦so even if my referral letter (i think i got it in Mar 2023) expires  i dunnid a new one coz my dentist can just help me book?,btohqsg
You are alr in the NDC system,btohqsg
Im surprised i get slots really fast,btohqsg
The referral is to get you in the NDC system,btohqsg
But i think only the 1st one is hard to come bu,btohqsg
Oh not to the department? Coz they are all linked?,btohqsg
Within departments is just called a consult,btohqsg
Then why did i even get 2 separate referral lettersðŸ’€,btohqsg
Neh im gonna leave my top there coz it came out fully,btohqsg
I am surprised you even had the letter tbh,btohqsg
I had terrible experience extracting toothâ€¦even not wisdom  the blood just cant stopðŸ’€,btohqsg
Which poly clinic did u use?,btohqsg
It is not surprising coz most polyclinic dentist are fresh grads anyways,btohqsg
No like from an admin perspective the letter is redundant,btohqsg
And bruh the dentist did not give me my x-ray,btohqsg
Say will email and never cameðŸ’€,btohqsg
And it is so damn hard to contact polyclinic,btohqsg
Ah makes sense of course it's NHGP,btohqsg
Yea but the letter was written by the dentist,btohqsg
U mean singhealth and nup is better?,btohqsg
No my point is if u actually use the Sing Health system u won't even need the letter,btohqsg
It's synced up via the same system,btohqsg
Yea coz ndc is under singhealth,btohqsg
From my chers ans shld be 14/20,btohqsg
Tbh there is a polyclinic right next to ndc  could hv used that,btohqsg
Yes NUHS and Singhealth is better lmao,btohqsg
I think a stingy me will wait till i wait for somewhere that i can claim,btohqsg
Why would i want to spend extra out of pocket,btohqsg
Not worth itðŸ’€ðŸ’€I think i will be pes E or F,btohqsg
