Just saw that amze card has a new topup featureAny idea if grabpay allows that for now?,btohqsg
Yups  except for travel related transactions and usual exclusion by banks.,btohqsg
From Feb 1  Gojek drivers will have to pay the company a higher 15% commission. This means they get to keep 85% of the fare from every trip  instead of 90% currently.https://str.sg/wyU9,btohqsg
By any chance will you be touching on the topic where you have return from very bad credit scores to apply for credit cards?,btohqsg
For sharing  I sent out a UOB ONE supp card application via email probably on the 1st of Dec.I just got approval today.If anybody wants to do any reference for their own application timeline,btohqsg
Any promo for uob one cc now or i shd wait in jan?,btohqsg
I made the conscious decision to choose GoJek over Grab because of the lower driver commission given to HQ. Now I‚Äôll go back to Grab :(,btohqsg
It depends on how bad the bad scores are. You‚Äôll have to demonstrate consistent and timely payment of credit facilities over six months and then review your credit scores.,btohqsg
Thanks Timothy! But there is no way you can improve the credit score unless one of the many banks going to approve your application of the card.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs right! Do you have any existing credit facilities  such as mortgages or personal loan  with any FI (financial institution) / bank?,btohqsg
Nope I don‚Äôt. All terminated and paid.,btohqsg
Oooh. You paid them all. Hmm.Then you‚Äôd be able to apply for just at least one credit card somewhere  at the very least one of the Big 3 SG banks bah,btohqsg
Is kind of a topic that might be a good YouTube video. But need a lot of research.,btohqsg
All decline due to bad scores,btohqsg
Totally agree. More like other peoples experiences as well.,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs a chicken and egg thing. You cannot improve the score unless you have a credit with them. E.g credit card. But you are not able to get any because of bad scores üòÇ,btohqsg
Probably gotta try those credit cards which requires u to put in certain deposits?Maybe that will help?,btohqsg
The rules state that you‚Äôll have to have at least 30K annual income. In Singapore credit score is based on a variety of factors especially timely repayment  low utilization  long established credit history etchttps://www.creditbureau.com.sg/credit-score.html,btohqsg
So there were suggestions to get from tier 2 or 3 banks  because they have smaller pool and more willing to be open for more clients. Tried. Even diners. üòÇ,btohqsg
‚Ä¶ Or Trust Bank? Should be able to get at the very minimum the $500 credit limit card what,btohqsg
I walked in once to UOB. To pledge 10k deposit. So far no outcome. Been months.,btohqsg
I think have to take a few years to ‚Äúrecover ‚Äú from it.I had a similar incident with UOB Credit cards too. Which is close to almost 15 years agoI just made do with no cards  after a few years I tried again  it worked just fine for me .,btohqsg
Hey thanks for sharing your experience! May I know how many years it took?,btohqsg
See how lor. You usually get a credit report after you apply for a new credit card. Read the report and see what are the adverse factors working against you‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I mean I am not dying to have a credit card. But I m not comfortable using debit only. üòÇ,btohqsg
I really wouldn‚Äôt remember  I was a young adult then probably early 20s don‚Äôt know how to manage my money properly  not a gambling issue  just like to anyhow buy things üòÇEventually I got out of it.,btohqsg
Maybe just to share abit on credit bureau. If you have applied credit cards across banks within a few months. They will drop your scores because they flag it as red as it is a sign of desperation üòÇ then if you request for credit report a few times in a year. It will also falls within the same category  because banks does give free cb reports if you try to apply cards from them.,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your personal experience. It takes courage. Thumbs up. But ya. We have similar history.,btohqsg
Yep you‚Äôll probably have to see what drives your credit scores down ‚Ä¶ try again 6 months later,btohqsg
So I tried to nego for the recent good FD rate that UOB has. And pledge that amount as collateral for the card. Cannot.,btohqsg
So I believe tier 1 banks are not short of customers. They are choosing quality customers now.,btohqsg
Then diners  the card that almost no place is accepting the card. Also kena rejected. I loled.,btohqsg
For people who have good credit scores or normal credit scores  they usually would not know this issue. Once in. Hard to come out üòÜ,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the fastest way to clear $100 grab power up challenge?,btohqsg
Is it still recommended to sign up for SMART Standard Chartered Credit card? mainly for bus & mrt,btohqsg
Just speed $100 on food during Xmas eve. Not sure is that counted as grab power up,btohqsg
While cashback of 6% is decent  the cashback options v limited.Also if you enter the SC mobile app  you don‚Äôt get cashback directly but have to redeem ‚Äúpoints‚Äù which are like 3200 for $10. I used it for simplygo and some fast food only and had to take a long time (6-9months) to get just $10 off. Me taking the rewards and running from SC thereafter lolThose with wider categories and more direct Cashback (eg. DBS your spending in month automatically credited as Cashback) is a much more palatable optionJust my $0.02,btohqsg
