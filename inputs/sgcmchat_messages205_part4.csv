Is just they are owners who don‚Äôt go out if ykwim,btohqsg
We also unfortunately regret to mention that due to some backend issues the stickers aren't waterproof and will start to fade. This isn't by design and is a production error and we apologise.Please message us with a photo of the sticker and we will replace it at the next meet FOC.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not trying to be funny. I am actually wondering  and if it‚Äôs available for daily use.,btohqsg
Lowkey feeling like the csgo stickers when u scratch them,btohqsg
I'm just going back japan then find the arasaka delorean again,btohqsg
