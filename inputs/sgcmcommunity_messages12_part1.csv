Hi. Does anyone happen to know if we rent car in JB  SG licence is acceptable or will need to apply for an International Driving Permit to drive in there?,btohqsg
international license is quite irrelevant today. even in america  they accept sinkie license. common langauge is english,btohqsg
"Ah ok cause I rented then in the invoice it wrote ""international driving permit is required"" so was wondering is it really needed or its just the typical words used in their template",btohqsg
in the past  yeah. since 2000  it's no longer required. the reason it is required last tiume is due to language barriers. today nobody asked for this anymore. i only applied it once in 2003. and i hardly used it. because car rentals never asked for it,btohqsg
