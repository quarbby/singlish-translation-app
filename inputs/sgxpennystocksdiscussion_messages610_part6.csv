Breaking news: Chinese soldiers were seen sending over a new secret weapon to Russian troops on the Ukrainian border. Intelligence reports that the Chinese soldiers were handing them packages of white balls. A few landed on the ground and a witness says it split open and the brown or creamy colored contents fell out. Military experts suspect these are a new form of explosive - possibly IEDs for a possible minefield setup. A Chinese soldier was spied demonstrating how to arm these new explosives to a Russian soldier by first soaking them in water. See spy photo below.,btohqsg

💎Pika World Update 16 February 2022💎🎉A Roar Back🚀The equity market finished higher to snap off from the low as Russia was seen to have pulled back some of its troops from the Ukrainian border. This helped to alleviate the fear of an escalation into war.The optimism elevates major indices higher in Russia's openness to a diplomatic solution. Nonetheless  geopolitical risks are still high as British Prime Minister Boris signalled his scepticism on any softening of stance by Russia. President Biden also shared such sentiments.WTI crude oil retreated with the positive Russia dynamics as the fear that Europe may be forced to put sanctions on Russian oil to reduce global supply and push prices higher. This may worsen the already worried inflation globally.🎢Airbnb: Top estimates💰The company registered a better than expected fourth-quarter result as the company sees short term rentals up by 78% from a year ago. It is also higher than the 2019 level by 38% to hit $1.53 billion in revenue  well ahead of the Wall Street consensus of $1.46 billion.Pika World is increasingly looking at possible re-opening play during any pullback with only mild accumulation.🧨Roblox: A more comprehensive loss🥊The company reported a record number of active users  but shares sunk in the after-hour as it had incurred a more significant loss than expected net loss for the quarter to reach $143.3 million or 25 cents per share.It is still growing rapidly and internationally as a platform that attracts children and teens with online games experiences. The CFO is also optimistic that it can increase its age demographics and add music on the platform. This includes the brand partnerships and the spread of breadth in content. It could be more appealing to the older age group too.Pika World is monitoring the counter for a potential entry point.It is 16 February  Wednesday  7.00 am in Singapore and 7.00 pm in New York.It has been a robust trading week  and all eyes will be on the FOMC minutes. Stay light as we ride the volatile wave together.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
