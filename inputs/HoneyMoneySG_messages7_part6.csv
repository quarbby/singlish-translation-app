Or just normal credit card is fine for the $500 stake,btohqsg
Is this better than the usual “high-interest” saving bank account like OCBC 360? Any recommendations for storage of cash?,btohqsg
You can buy $500 worth of crypto with fiat via fast transfer also,btohqsg
The UOB absolute > gpmc > ruby steel is to stack the Cashback. 1.7% + 2%,btohqsg
Topping up or buying crypto with normal credit card may have unwanted fees incurred,btohqsg
I thought revolut is to save on the DCC though?,btohqsg
There's no longer any fees via grab,btohqsg
Damn  my gpmc alr hit 75% limit for the year,btohqsg
So no DCC at all right via grab.,btohqsg
Okay can  I shall stake the $500 to get my ruby cdc. Thanks!,btohqsg
Do it before 30 may to get 2% Cashback instead of 1%.,btohqsg
There's double referral rewards now too if your new,btohqsg
30/5 they nerf to 1% again meh,btohqsg
I thought they reversed the nerf to 2%,btohqsg
Ya...ruby nerfed to 0.5% then to 1% then to 2% until 30 May (till 180 days stake up) then back to 1%,btohqsg
Wa like that not worth  if it's just 1% after 30 May.,btohqsg
1% is after your 180day stake,btohqsg
So you can still get 2% if you stake before 30 may. All stake starting after 30 may will take also start with 1%,btohqsg
Then the cro rewards from my spendings will also be 2% during the stake period?,btohqsg
Ruby = Spending 2% during your 180 days stake period + free Spotify. No rewards on the staked amount.,btohqsg
Okay I get it now  thanks. And no additional fees using gpmc to top up cdc card anymore right? So the revolut step can be skipped.,btohqsg
Fantastic  thanks for your help. 🙃🙃,btohqsg
For amaze card if u use the card to tap and using gpay does it make a difference ?,btohqsg
That means all the purchase will come as online payment..Will be eligible for rewards,btohqsg
