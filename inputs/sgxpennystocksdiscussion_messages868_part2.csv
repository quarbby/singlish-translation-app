Crude Oily🛢️WTI futures fell by almost 4% to below $70 a barrel on Wednesday  the lowest since early July  on demand worries and increased supply. EIA data showed gasoline inventories in the US were up by 5.4 million barrels in the week ending December 1st  the biggest increase in nine weeks  much higher than forecasts of 1 million  implying weaker demand. Also  worries about China's economic health influenced prices after Moody's downgraded China's rating outlook to negative the day before. Adding to woes  BEA data showed US crude exports were near a record 6 million barrels a day in October  with flows to Europe and Asia showing a steady increase.,btohqsg
