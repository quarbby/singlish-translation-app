I think will increase as they couldnt care less,btohqsg
The new o lvl geog sylla,btohqsg
Is better fit w a lvl,btohqsg
Like more of the content legit overlap from what ik,btohqsg
They take out most of physical geog for H1 la pls,btohqsg
I'm happy in the sense of,btohqsg
Exam wise it's easier for me,btohqsg
Oh shit I tot h1 econs,btohqsg
It's just that y'all don't have to suffer the hell of essay writing,btohqsg
2.5hrs for 3 25m essays xd,btohqsg
70% cuz 3 chapters + some other stuff like 1/mps+ mpt +mpm,btohqsg
I must make a shrine and pray to si Yan rn,btohqsg
this is 2 years after mine but still,btohqsg
bro was the meteorite that wiped out the dinosaurs,btohqsg
bro wiped out the dinosaur population with cute little girls,btohqsg
Bro was reduced to an inanimate object,btohqsg
H1 geog actually study abt rocks,btohqsg
then for my time H2 had atmospheric processes and population issues,btohqsg
like paper 1 was physical geog then paper 2 was human geog,btohqsg
I think my friend say got,btohqsg
Tbh econs the most relevant subject n oso ya i kinda hate tge other humans but like econs,btohqsg
time taken for stone to decay,btohqsg
Wait isn't there smth that's beyond bc,btohqsg
Lol ya got tuition but this as a reason between econs vs geog,btohqsg
Yea then on the notes be like (H2 only) or sth like that,btohqsg
geog syllabus fr changed a lot over the years,btohqsg
Ya im dying now w the math part of it‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I think now the o lvl more link to A,btohqsg
Link between o n a lvl geog,btohqsg
i never took o level geog so idk what that means,btohqsg
The things U learn from o lvl geog content wise,btohqsg
Is basically useless in a lvl,btohqsg
Ok but I think old sylla alrd sooo,btohqsg
Idk to me  it seems like jc students are not taught enough to do anything Infocomm related‚Ä¶like Coding/Testing unless prior experience in companies  I doubt they can be put through to Infocomm diplomas,btohqsg
Again idk much about the jc curriculum but last I checked  there are no computer applications lessons.Closest is computing  but that teaches you coding languages  does not teach you applications which is a required knowledge in poly if you want to transition mid way through,btohqsg
How does karang guni work does anyone know,btohqsg
Like u give them recycable items isit,btohqsg
You give them your recycled materials  they weigh and give you a Amt based off the weight. They take your items to a warehouse/recycling point/truck and recycling houses/companies would buy off the collected items from them and pay them a price for it,btohqsg
The only thing is the average commoner won‚Äôt collect enough weight to sell said items/have no schedule of the trucks/ unviable if you are able bodied and can find work,btohqsg
sec sch students are also not taught anything infocomm related  yet they can go poly do infocomm stuff,btohqsg
Common courses maybe  but if you go into specialisation i doubt it‚Äôs possible unless of course you go rp,btohqsg
I rmb my mum used to discard our recycables to the karang guni,btohqsg
Where they practically take anybody at this point,btohqsg
I loved stepping on cans to crush them then we wld have like a whole bag full to give to the uncle karang guni,btohqsg
then whos gonna go to those then,btohqsg
lmaoo my tele acting funny. last night i sudd got logged out thn all mu msg here frm the past few days all gone.(not impt tho js find it funny),btohqsg
honestly nowadays alot of things can js learn frm youtube,btohqsg
Follows the same concept as applied science  have to get some prior experience first,btohqsg
then jc students also can be taught alr what,btohqsg
forgot to clarify it was only for NT students,btohqsg
but idk na/exp students cnnt take meh?,btohqsg
after jc cannot go some specialised course in poly,btohqsg
if thats true then who r those courses for,btohqsg
Can is can ah but then When you say jc go poly  I would imagine the criteria for ict courses are more stringent. No?,btohqsg
what to u think ppl go poly for?,btohqsg
they dunnid to know everything  the lecturer's r thr to teach them,btohqsg
did yall not learn basic comp skills in pri sch? Microsoft office all this,btohqsg
My faci told me for my poly  there is a unwritten rule where if jc students want to transition to Infocomm courses  they will be placed in a separate batch from the rest of the students,btohqsg
yup computing. but in order to take that you need to pass some selection test. most jc students do more conventional things like biomed life science med law psych biz nursing instead... i mean you can do comp eng or cs in uni  the req is usually h2 comp with h2 math? something along those lines,btohqsg
never heard that word in my life,btohqsg
Last I checked the other diplomas did not have this system in place‚Ä¶it was either without prior experience  it was instant reject or main intake for those that has have.no ‚Äúholding cell‚Äù,btohqsg
maybe is a rp oni thing,btohqsg
i've legit never heard anyone call them a facilitator,btohqsg
yea just one more fucked up thing about rp...,btohqsg
rp is also the Jc score thing,btohqsg
you get these stickers from rand ah,btohqsg
Raffles Programme is basically ip but raffles version,btohqsg
are there Malay people in raffles,btohqsg
i would imagine if you talking about jc to poly transition..you have not been through computing yet,btohqsg
can see from their football team alr,btohqsg
RP students = raffles prog students,btohqsg
jc has no penalty fee for leaving mid way through?,btohqsg
its an actual acronym so i got confused,btohqsg
Its an rp oni thing also,btohqsg
"""i would imagine"" for a reason right",btohqsg
then the rest calls them lecturers professors i suppose?,btohqsg
Man just curious  Ryan do you ever reflect on the way you'd speak online,btohqsg
because ive legit never heard anybody called their teacher a facilitator,btohqsg
"reason being: ""we dont call us lecturers because we dont lecture. We facilitate ur learning""",btohqsg
yea only heard it from rp,btohqsg
Yes always..until ive realise damaged done and no point taking anything back,btohqsg
in ite is supposed to be lecturers but i js call them tchers cuz idh a single lecture mines all sec sch style teaching,btohqsg
yes if i rmb correctly..they constantly use the word facillitate,btohqsg
You have a hidden talentKeep it hidden,btohqsg
there are ite students who go to SP and NP,btohqsg
jc cnnt lah  unless priv o's,btohqsg
even if you dont make make the cut to go y2 in any other poly from ite..you can still go rp,btohqsg
as a student  this schools feels like it exist predominantly to not give sg a bad image of its students,btohqsg
rp is basically people that didn‚Äôt want to go ite,btohqsg
didnt know poly ite also have elitist gap,btohqsg
So many policies..so many rules..so many special things rp do predominantly to pass their students and give them a manufactured representation of students in poly,btohqsg
i thought my vjc friend was bad enough,btohqsg
like where have you heard off a bellcurve in poly,btohqsg
depends on the flight u take i think,btohqsg
im a jc student  i do not know the social politics about polys,btohqsg
people go rp because they don‚Äôt want to do two extra years in ite,btohqsg
dw..its just the social politics of rp,btohqsg
yes but it depends on which route ur taking,btohqsg
rp is that one poly..where everybody goes..when i say everybody. i mean everybody,btohqsg
thats sounds like a dogshit score,btohqsg
We have 30 yrs olds in the main intake..we have overseas uni students in our poly...we have ppl that spend 5-6 yrs in the main intake,btohqsg
what the fuck are 30 year olds doing in poly,btohqsg
go ns..work abit then come poly join main intake,btohqsg
switch career and up skill is it ?,btohqsg
only way to get removed from rp is failing 2 modules in 2 sems or 1 module in 3 sem,btohqsg
5-6 years can get masters in uni bud,btohqsg
and im not a poly student,btohqsg
maybe..but join the main intake..not the part time diploma/part time study,btohqsg
fellow j1 here   do y'all have any regrets choosing jc ?,btohqsg
Actually how come all of a sudden you'd decide to pop back here,btohqsg
üíÄoh yea did i mention..he was reaccepted back into rp..like a few months later i could have sworn i saw him,btohqsg
I always wanted to do A Levels,btohqsg
‚Äúdecided to check on things‚Äù thts what he said,btohqsg
üò≠üò≠üò≠ i got nett 6 sent to ej,btohqsg
main discord servers died..so finding another place to socialise,btohqsg
maybe get some irl socialization instead of tele,btohqsg
the bottom line is anybody that wants to go rp..all they have to rmbis.youcan go any other poly  go through y1/y2 decide you cant sustain...come rp  you will have the most chill environment in the world,btohqsg
I'm glad I'm able to take As in due time,btohqsg
and how many rp students make it to uni? doesn't need to be the big 3,btohqsg
the poly showed us the acceptance scores for sutd and suss a yr or two back from students that attended rp..it was 3.4/3.5,btohqsg
also i heard that ib is better than a's for overseas uni? i wonder why,btohqsg
maybe cuz the word ‚Äúinternational‚Äù is inside,btohqsg
A is more of to get into sg university,btohqsg
tbh i feel like ppl in rp slackers,btohqsg
no wonder my parents wanted me to study hard so that i can go to a better school  where students are more likely to be studious üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
cuz moe decided to send me there,btohqsg
simillar to the other poly's from what i heard  because uni acceptance is not based off school,btohqsg
u can slack while other ppl is studios lmao,btohqsg
but if you just want to slack back..do what is needed and nothing more. just want a easy poly life and still get a decent gpa of 3.0...go rp,btohqsg
i honestly have a weird perception of studiousness. essentially just someone who studies really hard i ºd say. idk if i would call myself studious  but probably half-half  compared to my peers.,btohqsg
shldve went to sa/ac to party and cheat lol,btohqsg
outliers as in studios or slackers?,btohqsg
the exams/test in rp..60-70% of the qns been recycled across cohorts,btohqsg
"the faci's even told me that ""what makes you think the faci's will find the time to rethink of qns""",btohqsg
an actual blessing if the brits did this for a's,btohqsg
but how to be studious and end up in rp,btohqsg
can be chill anywhere if u dont give a shit abt ur work,btohqsg
the thing is even if you slack in rp..you will still end up in a class with 3.5-3.8gpa ppl,btohqsg
maybe they finally woke up when they r in rp,btohqsg
dont listen to him  he too chill until he got less then 2 gpa,btohqsg
there are 4.0s in every school,btohqsg
my gpa in y1 sem 2 was 1.5  my teamate was a 3.8,btohqsg
bruh im getting A's and B's now,btohqsg
huh so u jump frm 1.5 to 4.0???,btohqsg
if u get A n B i sign on WOSpec now,btohqsg
no lah..but i think at least a high 2. something,btohqsg
even in ite is hard to pull up gpa after fking up sem 1,btohqsg
still can pull up to 3+,btohqsg
idk what gpa this results yield,btohqsg
C and D... i would cry if i got those for my promos,btohqsg
how does gpa work / how is it calculated,btohqsg
sometimes the tests in rp are rigged,btohqsg
i have no idea we use rank points and AAA/A score here,btohqsg
im asking how gpa is calculated in polys,btohqsg
isnt this o levels as well,btohqsg
but ik all a's 4.0 all b's 3.0  all c's 2.0,btohqsg
yea 60+ ppl kenna for my batch,btohqsg
half of them copy the same exact codes w/ same errors,btohqsg
i wan try cheat in ite,btohqsg
glad i didnt go to poly now,btohqsg
you guys are making it sound like polys are disastrous,btohqsg
HAHAHA but poly is so much easier than jc tbh,btohqsg
you have to be consistent in poly,btohqsg
last minute studying students are gone,btohqsg
"if you have periods of ""i dont like studying"" and periods of "" im going to put my 100%""...then going to poly is a curse",btohqsg
i cant even by chicken rice,btohqsg
used to be can buy chicken rice,btohqsg
yeah but a level content is ginormous,btohqsg
for other poly's not mine..faci's have told my classs b4 that majority of the 3 month long graded assignments can be done in 1 week,btohqsg
our first topic notes are already thick as hell,btohqsg
anyone know how to make fake ic to sneak into clubs,btohqsg
everything  except for chinese pw and gp,btohqsg
I forgot what's stem again help,btohqsg
Ah yes probably I'll enjoy it,btohqsg
then what about poly to uni,btohqsg
I heard they can skip first year,btohqsg
Unfortunately there's no epi pen for that allergic rxn,btohqsg
so poly students still go for the full 3 years?,btohqsg
is it 3 years for bach deg in sg unis,btohqsg
then go poly got no difference,btohqsg
i also went jc because i hearsay that poly is expensive...,btohqsg
dont want to waste my parents precious money,btohqsg
U can't rly get first foot into a job,btohqsg
With just a A lvl cert,btohqsg
U most likely need to go uni first,btohqsg
That's the main thing abt JC la,btohqsg
a level cert is just a paper for uni apps,btohqsg
Yes is cheaper in the short term,btohqsg
btw one of the comments i had for my A..the bellcurve i was referring to in rp,btohqsg
but the whole point of students going to jc is because their final destination is uni,btohqsg
if i failed the quiz..i was likely to have gotten B,btohqsg
I remb that time you got 7 marks or smth and got a B,btohqsg
im getting a S or a E if i got that for my weighted assessments,btohqsg
and i would defo cry and sob all day long if i got 7/20,btohqsg
that sounds like a pathetic score,btohqsg
"actually ""less people fail  nothing changes""",btohqsg
Ya it's damn normal in jc,btohqsg
"this 13.5/20 is exactly what i meant when i say rp dont reward hardwork..spending maybe 1-2 extra hrs a day to get that 16> also would have yielded the same grade of a ""A""",btohqsg
Big problem for poly context isit,btohqsg
i mean u get B but u got 7/20 ????,btohqsg
ngl h2 bio content doesnt seem that difficult,btohqsg
thats why i also said u can slack and still get decent gpa,btohqsg
yea i think im high too,btohqsg
nop. if you love that subject it will definitely be easy for you c:,btohqsg
doesnt matter how content heavy it is,btohqsg
Do you know who is nameless cat,btohqsg
I thought she has 2/3/4/5 kids alr ?,btohqsg
ok correction for soi..cause the other schools still got a low entry requirement for a reason,btohqsg
at least i act normal irl,btohqsg
never heard of that name b4  but i have a friend also in y1 sas  maybe she knows her lol,btohqsg
Don't associate w her   that's all I'm saying,btohqsg

"i had a female classmate that said this guy was ""pervertic"" for constantly posting pictures of girls in his ig stories..then a week later  i see her sitting with him having lunch..lmfao.",btohqsg
If you‚Äôre talking about tuition  better make sure you watch every single recorded video that you missed,btohqsg
bruh you know during y1 orientation last year  my pfp got blasted in the rp's telegram because someone wanted to find trouble with me,btohqsg
brought bunny to school last year tdc my teacher said she was cute,btohqsg
"I got this sucrose plush that I'm q attached to cuz my friend caught it for me :"")",btohqsg

Mr Chin says such posts are tightly moderated to clamp down on comments that encourage harmful behaviour.‚ÄúThough sharing these thoughts could hurt other students  we figured that it was important to keep that safe space ‚Äù adds Mr Chin  who is studying business at National University of Singapore.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an additional avenue for them to gain advice from their peers or seniors who may have walked a similar path and it may also benefit anybody else who relates to them.‚ÄùIndeed  Mr Pang  a computer science undergraduate at Singapore Management University  notes that he found it interesting how ‚Äúyounger folk tend to digest advice from strangers online better compared with those coming from an authoritative figure‚Äù.The number of users has grown steadily over the years  from 29 000 in 2019 to its current 226 000. It is the largest community on Reddit discussing education and student life in Singapore. In 2020  it also became a registered non-profit organisation.,btohqsg
Mr Pang and Mr Chin handed over the reins after five years to another team of young moderators  led by Mr Raphael Peck  22  who is in national service. They were avid users of the forum  who responded to a recruitment post and went through an interview process.Mr Peck says keeping the forum functional takes around three to four hours of his time each week  with the other six moderators on the team also putting in similar hours.That is time spent on moderating users‚Äô posts and comments  creating the community‚Äôs megathreads and putting together useful resources  such as Ask Me Anything threads with experts and professors.As for why this work is worthwhile  Mr Peck says the community ‚Äúoffers a sense of comfort that I am not the only one who has struggles in the competitive education system in Singapore  or who fears that making a wrong choice may drastically change my education options‚Äù.,btohqsg
im sry the article was rly vv long,btohqsg
out of all the poly chats ive seen this one is the worst dude,btohqsg
hychael person doxxed himself tbh üíÄ,btohqsg
now i know why people think of rp as such a bad poly,btohqsg
i helped brainstorm how to respond to the journalist LOL,btohqsg
looks like not only are the students not studious  they also have no basic human decency,btohqsg
at this rate im pretty sure ite students are better,btohqsg
Itsok pray im nt like tht in 1 months time,btohqsg
No dont pray i js wont,btohqsg
becuz ite students want to get out of ite,btohqsg
that doopdoop person is an admin?,btohqsg
and hes just acting like that,btohqsg
I heard of this but dun really know why,btohqsg
considering the rp chat is damn calm right now i doubt you will experience something simillar,btohqsg
i think you should read the chats that@Ryannnnnnnnnnsent here,btohqsg
just alot of drama in the earlier months,btohqsg
Idt this yr batch will üò≠,btohqsg
Oh but there was some fella some girl,btohqsg
Meanwhile the sun is making me so dehydrated,btohqsg
ur school students are more bothered with nonsense drama than studying,btohqsg
She act like she so zai,btohqsg
Luckily i came home before it gave me a headache,btohqsg
yea..the wifi aint good either for some schools,btohqsg
then like they encouraged ppl to engage and post,btohqsg
I mean if udw to just dont la,btohqsg
sounds like a nightmare of a school,btohqsg
is there anything good about rp,btohqsg
"Udh to comment in front of the facils n seniors that ""ite north eh for what sia""",btohqsg
I love the food there ngl,btohqsg
polys are opened to the public right?,btohqsg
can go to some polys to eat sometime,btohqsg
Nus food sucks  and the good food takes ages to come,btohqsg
Like i once waited 30min (or longer) after ordering my sphagetti,btohqsg
easier to get scholarships in rp?,btohqsg
Do uk anyth abt op this yr,btohqsg
okay in jc we just call it orientation lol,btohqsg
there isnt a prog at the back,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt just base this off a single convo on a messaging app lol,btohqsg
dont you think its still weird to act like this,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt the discord gc much worse? I haven‚Äôt been there in a while act,btohqsg
ya saying all these nsfw taglines,btohqsg
nope  not part of the programme  btw what school are you in? Science?,btohqsg
We need a filter system on all social media apps,btohqsg
since when were there ever school servers,btohqsg
"we only get more broad servers on discord like ""studying""",btohqsg
anyway whoever that was openly using such words is no different than the primary school kids i talked abt,btohqsg
i think they talking bout the sge disc,btohqsg
Is there a term for childish ppl,btohqsg
This year's likeliest gc for poly,btohqsg
ik and my point still stands,btohqsg
promote ite gc to ite gc,btohqsg
Look at the min gpa..yall will gasp,btohqsg
im too sian to listen to ppl talk abt school drama,btohqsg
Is it good wtf or bad wtf,btohqsg
lmao albus is the name of the cat,btohqsg
rp  during one presentation for my friend,btohqsg
did you put your name in the goblet of fire,btohqsg
in the books and movies is diff,btohqsg
other poly's prob have but not in presentable form,btohqsg
i think the faci's wanted to motivate my friend's cohort,btohqsg
yea ik but im just surprised by some of the min,btohqsg
and what is this guys source?,btohqsg
Omg i hope they do for my cohort cos iw to see for myself the bar to get in,btohqsg
the bar chart in the article,btohqsg
Ok but i did hear the principal talking abt like,btohqsg
i like to call him hairy potato,btohqsg
yea the stats are only for ict students,btohqsg
‚ÄúDID U PUT UR NAME IN THE GLOBET OF FIRE!!!‚Äù,btohqsg
"""The increases came mainly in construction and manufacturing for foreigners""",btohqsg
also this isn't number of jobs created  it's number of people being employed compared to the previous year,btohqsg
the article also attributed slow growth rate of residents employment to a lot of them getting retrenched,btohqsg
and lots of foreigners getting employed is nothing abnormal considering the drop off in2020-2021,btohqsg
i see  anyways i wont be affected for another 4 years..well see how the world is then by that time,btohqsg
i'm just saying this is what happens when people make comments like this without reading things properly,btohqsg
they weren't even sure if residents included PRs when the article literally clarifies it,btohqsg
isit? oh idk then maybe my 5 yr friend is part of that intake,btohqsg
thats why he can stay for 5 yrs,btohqsg
wait so what does that represent,btohqsg
no i know that  what does it mean for results wise,btohqsg
the chances of uni is around the 3.2-3.4? mark for non-big 3?,btohqsg
btw is it only rp or other polys also restructure more than 60% of modules every 2-3 yrs,btohqsg
people that gained admission in uni from2017-2023that graduated from your course,btohqsg
cause my poly redoes whole entire modules every 2-3 yrs..so the mods that someone graduated with in 2017..may have not went through 60% of the modules someone that graduated in 2021 may had,btohqsg
i mean i'm just thinking bc SIT's enrollment per year for every single course added together is 3k,btohqsg
doesn't make sense for 123 of those to come from one major from one poly,btohqsg
like currently  my soi batch is the last batch to be taught in depth java..the module has run for 2+ yrs alr. the new batch is now doing python,btohqsg
they been showing that..heard faci's said multiple times..if exams are too tough  they will relook at the test...if there are very few failures they will recycle the exams across semesters,btohqsg
like no kidding every paper..maybe max will have 5 diff qns,btohqsg
the rest of the 20+ qns are recycled,btohqsg
majority of students are getting C and B overall,btohqsg
anything higher its like a warzone,btohqsg
the idea ive always been saying its the only poly in sg that actually actively takes steps to make sure you pass,btohqsg
no matter what kind of results you are giving,btohqsg
Bro that's what I said. I am from discord lol,btohqsg
YES lmao I told ya u will confirm remember one,btohqsg
Grades calculation for each moduleAssuming daily grade is 6 D‚Äôs -600%Daily grades accounts for 30% of overall moduleD being 50-55/100C being 60-65/100B being 70-75/100A being80-100/100Daily Lessons-6(55)/600x30=16.5MSA accounts for 30% of overall moduleMSA-55/100x30=16.5ESE accounts for 40% of overall moduleESE-55/100x40=2222+16.5+16.5=55/10055/100 is D+So this module i would get D+ at the end of semester,btohqsg
At least back in SAS my module chairs told me that they don't la,btohqsg
thats your school  diff school runs with diff system,btohqsg
U are assuming daily grades tho,btohqsg
Some mods run on clustered grading,btohqsg
But the module chair has the discretion for grades,btohqsg
Wait kuro which poly are u in again,btohqsg
No lol some have moderation some don't,btohqsg
all i know is for my school  the faci's in my school have to do alot of explaining paperwork to module chairs if they fail a student..so most faci's die die  wont give students a F gradeunless they really are the kind to never hand up work  then that one dont need say alr,btohqsg
That's the case for entire rp,btohqsg
Very easy to get C or D but hard go get A or B,btohqsg
idk for science ah but for me  just hand up work and you will get B,btohqsg
Your work needs to be of some quality for that la,btohqsg
lmao i think some of the things ive been mentioning abt rp  kuro may be sceptical,btohqsg
But B average for CA grades not that much difference and it's MSA and ESE that plays the impt role,btohqsg
yea but that one just look at past papers..then just find answers for those..should be getting C for them,btohqsg
I wish i was not born at the equator,btohqsg
But it is still a privilege to be born here coz v few other country w comparable security and good schools etc,btohqsg
i want to be this chill in the future talking about things,btohqsg
time to invest in airbus stocks,btohqsg
@whatisgrassdo you remember Alyssa from a few years ago?,btohqsg
there's someone in discord who is also in YIJC and also struggled with bullying and family problems,btohqsg
actually just dip from airline stocks,btohqsg
bruh wasnt the convo on her ystd,btohqsg
can you give me a TLDR,btohqsg
ok kuro u give the tldr,btohqsg
btw I'm watching discord also rn  I'm not shittalking or anything,btohqsg
Iirc only ntu nus have bell curve,btohqsg
The other institution like poly dh,btohqsg
Maybe im wrong but poly test are set in a way that even if u fk up  moderation will pull u up,btohqsg
Bell curve make people harder to get A for a easy paper,btohqsg
U get fk if whole class score in the 50 -60 range. Which means your 51 means a c and the 58 is a A,btohqsg
thats how i ended up with a class with 20+ failures for a class test,btohqsg
that turned into 1 failure the next day,btohqsg
"""autism"" being thrown around like it's free",btohqsg
im a frequent discord user and i dont even want to go to sgexams discord,btohqsg
my fren randomly joined the disc tdy,btohqsg
discord rn has these 2 ppl in yijc,btohqsg
they haven't even taken their first test alr demoralised bc yijc is yp sch,btohqsg
tbh so far i haven't seen much abt regent sec,btohqsg

In 1 month  i was able to have 2.8k messages,btohqsg
I really wonder how bad regent is,btohqsg
i live near regent i can say still not so bad,btohqsg
i average 2k messages per month on discord in the past,btohqsg
