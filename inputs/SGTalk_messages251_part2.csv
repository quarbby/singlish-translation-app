So in the end dunno LG Aircon good or not,btohqsg
I heard recommendations for getting daikin aircon,btohqsg
Ya lor a lot of reviews for Daikin and starmex  but not much for LG,btohqsg
Ya daikin is usually the most recommended,btohqsg
But I think LG not good many years back  but since Aircon is expected to last like 10 years  to know if LG is good now  need to wait 10 years down the road to know,btohqsg
