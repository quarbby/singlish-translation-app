My bad gain city is not in,btohqsg
Any good OCBC card? That one we confirm not a holder,btohqsg
current plat charge has signup bonus for existing amex card holder. 90k miles for 8k spend. You can refer your wife so you can get some $ and your wife gets 100$ credit.,btohqsg
Yeah but the 1.7k hard to swallow ü§£ I paid once enough Liao.Sorry  my questions feel kinda tough‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt plan early enough keep on procrastinating haha,btohqsg
Actually if you do not mind lesser miles  maybe can consider uob kf,btohqsg
Oh sorry maybe that is online,btohqsg
@RyanWayneeAtome?https://www.atome.sg/en-sg/paylater-merchants/gain-cityThen can add DBS wwmc  HSBC revo,btohqsg
I would like to check on OCBC 360.Eg: I have 45K in my account in Jan I did received my SAVE & SALARY bonus for Dec credited in Jan. In the mth of Jan I withdrew 15K out for investment which leaves me with 30K balance. At the end of Jan I did credit my $1800 min requirement and have the $500 increment. But on my Feb transaction  I was only credited SALARY bonus. Why is that so? Same for March (Just checked)Must it be I have to have 45k + 500 to qualify for the save bonus?,btohqsg
OCBC rewards cap spend is 1000? Can it be paid at gain city to earn the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Your mab for Jan should be 44.5k and above I guess,btohqsg
Yup looks like wells and four star also on atome. If cashier nice maybe they let u split atome and paywave,btohqsg
2 % rebate on top of 1OCBC$ every dollar spend at best denkihttps://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/rewards-card#:~:text=The%20maximum%20bonus%20OCBC%24%20you%20can%20earn%20a%20month%20is%2010%2C000.&text=We%20will%20award%20OCBC%24%20in S%245%20for%20each%20transaction.,btohqsg
got multiple items so i dont see why not,btohqsg
Ah so the plan is to add WWMC to atome and pay via atome? What is the cap? Is it 1.5k?,btohqsg
can add crmc also  hsbc revo,btohqsg
1.5k so max is 4.5k bill. You 1 account and your wife 1 account can settle 9k.,btohqsg

May I ask1. amaze+crmc use overseas has $1000 limit before 1% charges kick in?2. Chocolate use overseas has $1000 limit for 2mpd?Thanks.,btohqsg
Average for previous and current month,btohqsg
1. no 1% charge for fcy spends but 1k for crmc 4mpd2. 1k limit for chocolate 2mpd no matter what spend,btohqsg
So instant withdrawals will eventually return?,btohqsg
I think so  they just need a few days to liquidate their funds to restore their liquidity pool,btohqsg
im keeping my expectation low for chocolate finance,btohqsg
Oh ok thanks! Seems like that kinda solve the issue. But isn‚Äôt atome splitting your total bill into 3 months? I shouldn‚Äôt do that and just pay lump sum right?,btohqsg
in your case isn't it better to spread to a few months? essentially  your max cap is increased to 3 months worth,btohqsg
atom splits your bill into 3 portions so you can pay in 3 months. I just rememberhttps://help.atome.sg/hc/en-gb/articles/4403090262681-What-is-my-spending-limitAtome has limit to 3k transaction amount on cc. So only 3k bill per atome usage ,btohqsg
Ah that‚Äôs true  sorry haven‚Äôt use atome in a long while but I always thought ‚ÄúIPP‚Äù doesn‚Äôt earn you points so under the impression that if I do that I won‚Äôt get my miles,btohqsg
bank ipp (usually 6  12  24 month) no  atome is different (buy now pay later),btohqsg
Actually in my experience  I suspect if your singpass income is a certain level  this limit is also increased,btohqsg
Tomorrow is 3 days since the initial pause right? So hopefully some who withdrew early Monday should be processed? Fingers crossed,btohqsg
i researched this cuz last time my amaze got declined with reason ‚Äúnot enough limit‚Äù or something similar. Amaze is classified as debit card.,btohqsg
Ah Okok that clears up the confusion thank you! In this case  cause I‚Äôm also an old holder of the Citi rewards Visa card as well.Would it be ideal if I just spend 3k (split in 3 months) on my Citi rewards visa? So it‚Äôs 1k per month which maxed out my online spend for the card?,btohqsg
Does atome classify as online spend?,btohqsg
I will caution you that somehow citibank visa cards (crv  smrt) don't see atome as online spend. Citibank master cards are online for atome,btohqsg
data from our dear@jmthamthat atome does not get points for citi rewards visa so better not,btohqsg
Oh ok ok then to play safe I just use my Citi rewards master card,btohqsg
I heard similar stories for citi rewards master so dbs wwmc (or hsbc revo) is a safer bet,btohqsg
I personally have charged my atome to crmc and its ok,btohqsg
Thanks both for your help  basically the most urgent one is paying a 3.5k AC bill from gain city so that gain city can arrange for pipping works to be done.The rest prolly can wait for card approved then settle.,btohqsg
Manually charge it or auto deduction?,btohqsg
Oh gain city very flexible with how you pay the bill hahahaha. U can use your crv with shopback  then split a bit onto atome  then paywave  should be ok,btohqsg
Hi experts  can I earn 4 mpd on Turkish airline tickets using UOB ladies travel category?,btohqsg
Oh so Citi rewards visa with ShopBack also works?,btohqsg
Heard tomorrow will start receiving in bank for some.,btohqsg
So if  3.5k bill$500 via ShopBack pay (Citi rewards visa)3k via atome split 3 months (Citi rewards master card)That would solve the entire issue with 4mpd online shopping?,btohqsg
Does uob prvi card earn 2.4miles when paying overseas hotel on the spot?,btohqsg
remember to collect voucher in atome app before paying :) can save a bit more,btohqsg
Should be. Could be 3mpd if myr  thb  vnd or idr,btohqsg
Dear all  in case I missed out  can anyone advise any attractive welcome gift from credit card companies if I apply as a newcomer ?,btohqsg
Do you have any cards in mind? I dont suggest signing up just for the signup bonus,btohqsg
