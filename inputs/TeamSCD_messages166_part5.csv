Hi all do help my friend with his survey thanks in advancehttps://forms.gle/DFRqsUDNJK4coDeA7,btohqsg
Hi all  can I ask for your opinion please. I was driving  and went through a rough road  I think it has hurt my undercarriage. There was sudden loss of power and shakes awhile. I stopped nearby  off engine. After awhile it works like normal again all the way.But the thing is my friend said he heard some metal rattling sound coming from behind the car after I dropped him off. do you think it could be a nut went off somewhere?,btohqsg
Sudden loss of power wouldnt be Undercarriage and something with your powertrain,btohqsg
If the patch was really rough it can sometimes overload the ecu on a street car which may just cut power. Which is why immediately afterward no symptoms. I imagine if it were something serious you wouldnâ€™t have a normal drive afterwards. No trouble code either right?,btohqsg
Yea  even today I drove everything is normal  only yesterday after the rough patch it's weird. Acceleration suddenly went down after the really rough patch even when I accelerate. Yes no trouble code bro,btohqsg
I don't know for yesterday  at gear 5 accelerate halfway suddenly lose power  speed went down. Then I down gear and it happened again at gear 4.After I restart engine  then it is smooth again.,btohqsg
like after a certain rpm then it lose power?,btohqsg
Perhaps the rough patch affected it for awhile. I'm glad today no problem. I better open my eyes big and avoid rough patches or Deep holes on the road.,btohqsg
then could be yr engine bah,btohqsg
cause if ur trans u probably cant even use a gear at all,btohqsg
But I test it after restarting engine  all is good. I even try to high Rev every gear to test all is good too. Even today,btohqsg
So should be fine I assume. Luckily ba,btohqsg
