1 questions the 1.76% from UOB one how to get it? Do I hv sms or inform the bank? I already hv $150K in there.,btohqsg
Read the UOB One promotion  tnc. Is it fresh fund you have put in? And have you registered for the promotion?,btohqsg
No. I am an elderly lady pls teach me how to do it to get the extra 1.76% as per above video?,btohqsg
Register & Fresh Fund? How much Fresh Fund? Register where? Can provide me the step? Thank you 🙏,btohqsg
Hi@Christine  maybe the first question is do you know how much you had in UOB One account in June this year? Ideally we want to know your Monthly Average Balance,btohqsg
This is seen in both the app or the web version when you click into the account as highlighted here,btohqsg
Hello all! For SQ business class  how much time ahead we can check in from the departure time at T3? Is it 24 hours? Appreciate ur help~,btohqsg

Hihi all  as I’m a new to this miles games  may I know if that’s sufficient for my daily spending by using Citi rewards + amaze for for online + offline spending  and dbswwc for travel spending?My monthly spending usually around 1k+. Thank you!,btohqsg
Sounds good  though you might want to consider adding the SC Smart card to capture public transport spending  the points earned there can be converted to miles as well,btohqsg
I feel sc smart card is better as a cashback card. To earn enough to redeem miles isnt easy (minimum 10k miles to redeem),btohqsg
Agree with this  and high risk of points becoming orphan,btohqsg
just wondering  if for usual online spending I can just use my Citi rewards card directly  while for offline spending  I have to use the amaze card  right?,btohqsg
There are a few offline MCCs that can use the Citi card directly but for ease offline just all go through amaze for fuss-free,btohqsg
Hi all  I am new here. can anyone please tell me which credit cards are the best for miles strategy? I currently own UOB krisflyer and DBS Altitude visa card. Plus UOB One card. But im thinking of changing these cards for UOB Ladies card or citi rewards cards.I’m more focusing on travel and foreign transaction categories.Which card will be good for this?Thank you!!,btohqsg
Slowly sign up the miles card to gain the signup bonus miles then after that decide which bank you like to stick with.,btohqsg
Can u get uob lady sol? If yes  travel and dining/family cat so you can still clock uob one acct interest.,btohqsg
DBS WWMC for online travel/FX  points pool with Altitude. If using UOB One Account  UOB Lady's to clock $500 spend.,btohqsg
I can’t get uob ladies sol. Does uob pink card and city rewards will be a good combo?,btohqsg
Should try applying. Many stories of ppl not meeting 120k and still got it. Else  UOB lady pink and Citi rewards with amaze is good as well.,btohqsg
I believe that advice is for naked citi rewards card. Pairing with amaze can just do recurring. Amaze will convert it to online for you.,btohqsg
Good day everyoneMay I know if these can be paid using cardup? If yes  which category? I tried searching but couldn't find a match,btohqsg
Dont think can use cardup for hdb related fees,btohqsg
any one holding uob reserve or uob visa infinite metal here?,btohqsg
Anybody got experience making online down payment for hotel restaurants? I'm making an online down payment for Si Chuan Dou Hua restaurant at Parkroyal on Beach Road. Was planning to use UOB Lady's Solitaire with my chosen dining category  but the payment request came from Parkroyal on Beach Road instead (screenshot). Does this mean I won't get any miles if I use UOB Lady's Solitaire? And should I use a miles card with travel (hotel) bonus or online spend cards (like amaze + citi rewards combo or DBS WWC) instead?,btohqsg
Citi can't be used for travel btw. Dbs wwmc seems to be the safest. Is ur lady sol not on travel category?,btohqsg
Oh ya.. forgot about that. Yup  it's currently on dining and fashion for this quarter  and the payment can't wait till next quarter for the change in category haha!,btohqsg

If telco (Circles Life) does not allow for monthly billing to be non-recurring  should I have my Citi Rewards card or Amaze card details under billing to be eligible for miles?,btohqsg
Are there any miles card that doesn't have annual fee and points don't expire? mpd not important.,btohqsg
As far as I know  no,btohqsg
Non expiring miles ain’t that important imo. You shouldn’t keep ur miles like 7-8y as it will get devalued.,btohqsg
Yeah good point. Probably miles not for me. My last holiday was 2018 via scoot to Ipoh.,btohqsg
Hi Guys  just to check the HSBC EGA if i make payment to my UOB CC using the HSBC apps (pay a bill) will i get 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Need to have GIRO payment method,btohqsg
Manually fill up the form and give to UOB branch,btohqsg
Just go with cashback bah. No points getting miles but u don't use anytime soon anyway.,btohqsg
Miles game is just another way to get values out of ur expenses  same as cashback.  Don't blindly do it because everyone on tiktok is saying so.,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  can I check if buying food at Kopitiam chain using FairPrice app  then using Apple Pay —> is it considered an online payment?  Similar to Kris+ (3rd party app?),btohqsg
hi all  does fair price gift voucher bought fromfairprice.com.sgeligible for minimum spending for citibank new card sign up? it is coded 5411 online. Singsaver TnC only says excluding flexibill/advance/quasi cash,btohqsg
hi all i saw that kris+ accepted at esso  just wanna check if i use kris+ to pay at esso  can i still get petrol discounts if using amaze and citi rewards or uob kf?,btohqsg
Just station discount  no bank card discount,btohqsg
hi also wanna check how long does basic miles of uob kf credits into kf membership?,btohqsg
