Petition to do home delivery for ktv services instead,btohqsg
me : pls hbl extrend my dnt courswork,btohqsg
It's safe to say we didn't even last  2 weeks,btohqsg
ikr now we are back to square one of this few nonths,btohqsg
Pretty sure the current situation is worse than when they decided to have HBL in may this year,btohqsg
I'm fresh out of JC and working as a student care teacher... I'm praying for HBL also,btohqsg
if HBL happens my contract will lapse and I'll finally get out of that job,btohqsg
seriously sia  I went into the job and the job description never said that my job includes washing giant metral trays and toilets,btohqsg
I'm done man  let me out,btohqsg
if not for the one month notice clause I'd be gone ages ago,btohqsg
Still a part of me thinks that no matter what  they probably wont implement hbl,btohqsg
I literally had zero idea about being a full time cleaner until day one of the job,btohqsg
I've been working at the place for 3+ weeks now,btohqsg
Last time they implement I think the covid cases was 50  but yesterday 170  they still never announce,btohqsg
Maybe they will announce tdy who knows,btohqsg
they say school not closing and I'm like what???,btohqsg
we literally have over 300 cases in 4 days,btohqsg
I saw the article just now,btohqsg
have school or online to me has not much impacts,btohqsg
still the students could spread to other students bruh,btohqsg
close SCC and tuition centre pls,btohqsg
btw  as a student care teacher I can confirm,btohqsg
you think they're clean? you think your procedures work?,btohqsg
fuck you  welcome to my classroom,btohqsg
Wonder how high the case number will be tdy,btohqsg
if today over 200 and they don't close schools,btohqsg
I will question the sanity of this government,btohqsg
last year those numbers were enough to be CB,btohqsg
i would take a neutral standpoint to this  but i will get flamed,btohqsg
this year also people won’t be so bad cos we know what to do,btohqsg
but doesnt mean got vaccine means confirm wont get covid,btohqsg
if ppl are socially irresponsible and go ktv,btohqsg
vaccine is vaccine but kids not vaccinated sia,btohqsg
why they socially responsible gp vaccine,btohqsg
cuz they compulsory must take lmao,btohqsg
Yes KTV people. Good decision on their hygiene and marital affairs,btohqsg
so not as bad as last year la,btohqsg
anyway we can handle it better,btohqsg
it’s easier to stamp out the virus,btohqsg
I didn’t even go out very much when restrictions were loosen but the changing of regulations out of the blue back and forth is so … puts people out of their elements omg back and forth haiz,btohqsg
i agree that primary schools and earlier shld be closed,btohqsg
just let p6 come back for studies,btohqsg
so basically u arent affected right,btohqsg
i legit questioning my sanity alr sia,btohqsg
if i had a job it wouldnt be so bad,btohqsg
but everyday im just 呆 at home,btohqsg
online tuition is considered a job,btohqsg
its ok my birthday this yr also,btohqsg
my 18th and 19th both spent in lockdown,btohqsg
like imagine being a late May baby,btohqsg
this year last year all gone,btohqsg
i think mine falls just outside,btohqsg
it ends on aug 18 right,btohqsg
YES my birthday is only a little bit outside that,btohqsg
I thought you have birthday every year,btohqsg
the only birthday i celebrate every year,btohqsg
ah yes not every year have a 29 feb,btohqsg
how do I avoid a situation where like,btohqsg
my job title and description says one thing,btohqsg
and I end up having to do shit like toilet washing,btohqsg
i will just quit straight away,btohqsg
Are you in that situation now? Oddly specific lol,btohqsg
because that sucked and I literally had no way of knowing until I arrived at my workplace,btohqsg
because is not mentioned in job description,btohqsg
I have to pay them salary,btohqsg
i rmb i got that same nonsense from some recruitment agency,btohqsg
then first day the workplace violated all safety regulations,btohqsg
and i didnt want to work anymore,btohqsg
Claim they breach of contract  unless you tell me washing toilet is in your contract,btohqsg
I already served half my contract,btohqsg
just dont have a job lor,btohqsg
sigh I actually have a decent relationship with my manager who is a nice old lady,btohqsg
I feel bad if I screw them over but being a maid for 3 weeks,btohqsg
A nice old lady would’ve hired an actual cleaner,btohqsg
LONG TIME NO SEE U STONE!!!,btohqsg
it's the company transfer me there  she has very little say in like the hiring but like... ya haiz,btohqsg
Then if she is really nice  she’d understand,btohqsg
ok like lemme explain the nature of my workplace,btohqsg
it's an after school student care center for pri sch kids,btohqsg
3 little study rooms with a pantry and a toilet,btohqsg
3 staff members: manager  a full time coworker and me the part timer,btohqsg
so like already  in terms of manpower  we have no manpower,btohqsg
Whats this work tea im drinking now,btohqsg
we basically run the whole place ourselves but like,btohqsg
I didn't sign up for this with a pay of $9 per hour,btohqsg
doing everything from senior management to physical labor,btohqsg
I know its a bit annoying,btohqsg
Why u dun see it from another side,btohqsg
Take it as training and gaining experience,btohqsg
what if stone's main purpose is to earn $?,btohqsg
I know it sucks big time to do stuffs that not stated in JD,btohqsg
about the senior management  because my manager is English illiterate  I have to handle all of her work,btohqsg
Wait I’m perplexed how can a student care be run by 3 ppl nani,btohqsg
Translating  copywriting  heck I've even done some graphic design,btohqsg
But it can really beef up your resume,btohqsg
U never know when u need some graphic designs in journalism,btohqsg
my purpose *is* to earn money but yeah sian,btohqsg
idt they will state the extra thing stone's done tho,btohqsg
U write ur own resume la,btohqsg
Definitely plenty of those things are going into my LinkedIn lmao,btohqsg
Don’t think as ure getting shortchanged now  but more of like gaining experience to earn more in the future,btohqsg
How long more til the end of your contract,btohqsg
2.5 weeks  counting this week as a 0.5 because I have vaccination on Thursday night,btohqsg
I know it sucks big time  but tahan a bit. Things will get easier when u really go find a ft job due to ur experience,btohqsg
thanks man... like I wish we could do something about it  but ya lah it's just a little more,btohqsg
And it also shows to ur future employers that u can handle shits la,btohqsg
do I really want to appeal to employers who see me as someone who can handle shit,btohqsg
Just pray that they will give you ex gratia,btohqsg
is that the kind of employer I want to attract,btohqsg
part time jobs are always underpaying ppl ma,btohqsg
if u want earn a lot of $ then freelance lor,btohqsg
But like u show that you can handle stuffs  in a way that is good. Not the negative manner,btohqsg
Cos most people i see is they hit a wall they just sit and cry,btohqsg
They dont do anything about it,btohqsg
Given that you really don’t want to throw the nice old lady under the bus  and just 3 weeks left  I think you feel like you don’t know but you actually know the answer. Haha we give you solutions but you hesitate  I feel like maybe you’re already prepared to just get it over and done with for the next 3 weeks.,btohqsg
maybe all I needed was to rant,btohqsg
thanks boi... a bit more and finally NUS can claim me,btohqsg
I know i may sound like a boomer but such things really do happen in the working world,btohqsg
I know haha  like I didn't believe it as a student,btohqsg
Same  i didn’t till i see it with my own eyes. Ive been in your shoes too,btohqsg
So i kinda unds your situation and mood,btohqsg
But trust me  it helps you in the future,btohqsg
You have a Masters/PhD  but if your attitude is those like “this one not under my scope i dw do” most people wouldn’t wanna hire you,btohqsg
thanks:)) plus tbh I love the kids a lot lol  and they also made me consider a future in drama education since I'm majoring in Theatre,btohqsg
Take everything as a learning opportunity!,btohqsg
Not a shit that you’ve been tasked to do,btohqsg
yep!! the underpaying sucks but being there and understudying a senior management personnel,btohqsg
maybe I just pretend it's a low pay internship🤣,btohqsg
Experience is something money can’t buy,btohqsg
Just gotta make the best out of it,btohqsg
I remember being a payroll intern back then. $600/mth,btohqsg
what did they make you do,btohqsg
I was working at raffles place  expensive food,btohqsg
Liaise with CPF IRAS and other agencies,btohqsg
I just take as learning experience,btohqsg
I didnt kpkb i just do. And i was rewarded with experience,btohqsg
And now in my current job  im armed with such experiences and i know what to avoid,btohqsg
Hahahah nice... yea the experience is invaluable tbh.,btohqsg
Like  my job really allows me to do a lot of things. Handling conflicts and crises between children  conducting lessons and classroom management  handling a space and knowing a bunch of SOPs and things,btohqsg
I'm thinking of transferring to Yale after Y1 in NUS,btohqsg
wowwww you can do it!!! :DD,btohqsg
thanks natalie!!! I really want it so much haha  like I'm alright with staying in NUS and I'm grateful that I even have a place  but Yale offers so much more opportunity to develop as a theatre/acting student and it would be a dream come true if I can have access to those resources,btohqsg
so I guess I'll give it a shot,btohqsg
[JUST IN]Covid-19 update in S'pore on July 20:NEW CASES: 195* Locally-transmitted cases: 182* Imported cases: 13Total cases: 63 440Of the 182 locally-transmitted cases  26 are currently unlinked. 12 cases belong to the KTV cluster  while 135 are linked to the Jurong Fishery Port cluster.Follow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates.,btohqsg
Yea we prob ain't getting HBL anytime soon,btohqsg
Yea it does have an impact- decreased sleep deprivation,btohqsg
unless it reaches breaking point then we wont i guess,btohqsg
and most of the student population would be vaccinated,btohqsg
doesn't mean we immune to covid tho,btohqsg
the government considered that rationale tho,btohqsg
I think HBL will happen only when there's school based spread,btohqsg
they shld just close the schools,btohqsg
it will ultimately reach breaking point,btohqsg
its js a matter of when,btohqsg
its actually convenient and easier for me,btohqsg
very hard to tell  but normally is read glassdoor/google reviews  google search for related news  look at length of tenure on linkedIn.also  bigger size company less likey to take on multiple roles,btohqsg
not gonna gaslight u  everything u experienced is valid... but really suggest u to ride out the remaining weeks bcus 3 weeks+ job don't hold much weight.. so ur experience & accomplishment may be heavily discounted,btohqsg
Better read through the contract and look at termination clauses,btohqsg
Doing work that's not within JD is actually pretty common,btohqsg
"Usually JD will mention things like ""assist with other tasks related to business operations""",btohqsg
Guys  my friend accidentally released his ic and address to what seem to be a scammer on the phone  what repercussions is he likely to expect?,btohqsg
I'm looking at my contract now,btohqsg
@mion6091in the event that my contract does not include info about my scope of work,btohqsg
will the MyCareersFuture or LinkedIn description serve as the legal job scope?,btohqsg
Because my job description is this,btohqsg
"last one is ""Delivery of *SCC name* curriculum""and that's it. No administrative extras or anything",btohqsg
Usually this data is sold to other scammers  so that they can call your friend and pretend they have personal information to threaten him with something,btohqsg
I won't release the name due to legal concerns but yeah I just wanna know my rights,btohqsg
There's nothing much he can do except not to pick up unsolicited calls and pretend the number is a dead number  and to change his bank credit card if he gave it away,btohqsg
I dont think he gave away any other details other than the ones he mentioned to me so,btohqsg
I think ill just let him know what you told me  thanks!,btohqsg
The JD is broad enough to include saikang,btohqsg
Honestly any job scope except for managerial will require you to do saikang,btohqsg
and I mean even full-time positions,btohqsg
Is it acceptable to request job description in contract,btohqsg
You should be applying based on JD in general,btohqsg
If it's through a recruitment company that's obligated to keep their client anonymous  they should actually do a preliminary talk with you first with slightly more detail about what their client does,btohqsg
Applying blind is a big no,btohqsg
I was interviewed  and I asked the interviewer about the day to day,btohqsg
I was told  you just have to serve the students lunch and teach them how to do homework and do our curriculum,btohqsg
Welp  sometimes interviewer don't actually know what people do on the ground,btohqsg
Legally  they are allowed to ask you to clean toilets  ethically of course not good.,btohqsg
This job was gotten through a recruitment agency?,btohqsg
Coz anyway  from what you've mentioned  the workplace definitely is not a good working environment what with all the understaffing and saikang,btohqsg
If there's no favourable termination clause then just serve another 3 weeks and leave,btohqsg
sorry hahah I'm terrible at this,btohqsg
but ok I can be fired for lateness and no show  and I won't have to serve notice,btohqsg
doesn't sit right with me though,btohqsg
Interview was from HR of the company,btohqsg
but yea I'll probably do this,btohqsg
I won't recommend this coz you never know what kind of connections a person has,btohqsg
sheesh why ruin the vibe :/,btohqsg
HR sometimes don't really know the full day-to-day as well,btohqsg
But if you signed a contract  they should have termination clauses,btohqsg
one month notice  and only on the last day of the month,btohqsg
so any such window was over on June 30th and I'd still have to do until end July,btohqsg
Have to finish the remaining 3 weeks,btohqsg
it's just tmr and thursday (taking mc on Friday for vaccination) + 2 weeks,btohqsg
remember ask for testimonial  may be useful in future,btohqsg
if my manager is not English literate  can I write my own testimonial and ask her to sign haha,btohqsg
i alrd say can lerh ma,btohqsg
Temp job testimonial abit weird but,btohqsg
If my manager not w the company alr can i stil ask for a testimonial,btohqsg
I was thinking  can ask her to write in Chinese then I translate,btohqsg
cos I work as a translator anyway,btohqsg
Just write urself and ask her sign,btohqsg
Face is nothing compared to future salaries 😂,btohqsg
Lol cca is cancelled from the 22nd of July still no hbl,btohqsg
Iw ask some stuff abt it,btohqsg
travelling to my workplace now... the next two weeks can't fly by fast enough,btohqsg
jiayou everyone  3 more days this week,btohqsg
wtf they just called me and transferred me to another school like with less than 2 hours notice,btohqsg
wth between jc and uni adult fare damn ex leh,btohqsg
will I burn bridges with my manager,btohqsg
cos I really like my manager  she's an amazing person,btohqsg
do u have a link? Or I just google,btohqsg
the manager seems to treat it as normal  like I'm pretty sure this IS the job but like it wasn't communicated to me during the interview or hiring,btohqsg
yup like I was suddenly transferred and idek if I'll be paid for the transport fees incurred,btohqsg
so they can change my workplace at will and I can't claim transport,btohqsg
written a note for rv  thanks for sharing,btohqsg
I'm at the new center and,btohqsg
I don't have to do any menial tasks???,btohqsg
in the other centre I have to do all the saikang and here I'm just,btohqsg
She only left 2 weeks la,btohqsg
Just tahan a bit and leave,btohqsg
I asked them if I can transfer here for the next two weeks  they say they will try and like anytime they have staff shortage they put me first on the list,btohqsg
Anyone knows why is there so many secondary school students going back home at the same time?,btohqsg
does anyone know where one can study in the current situation?,btohqsg
liddat quite hard to find tbh,btohqsg
As far as I know all cc close tdy,btohqsg
even at new centre  still better for u to draft the testimonial & they signtbh I don't think they have free time to prepare it  so if they prepare  may drag very long + content very generic  not reflecting ur exp & accomplishment.also  keep it simple within 1 page & pls start writing soon  maybe will end up on big boss's desk/email for quite a while before u get it back,btohqsg

can think back about why singapore govt encourage use of public transport,btohqsg
ok but public transport usually quite related to environment one,btohqsg
ok HAHA I READ UR QN WRONG SIA but environment's still a point nonetheless,btohqsg
hmm maybe i'll say like in an era where our planet is so heavily polluted and the number of cars in cities are increasing rapidly  perhaps switching to only public transport may seem like one of the best initiatives to cut down on carbon emissions,btohqsg
when i saw that thats legit my first thought tho,btohqsg
Pls i took so long to type this how to say out loud,btohqsg
Me and someone before me said smth like,btohqsg
Public transport should be for everyone even for ppl in villages not just cities etcetc,btohqsg
The examiner look at me like restless liddat,btohqsg
No points: (1) efficiency - this can be qualified to be a yes point too; (2) freedom of choice and convenience - can be yes or no also actl;. Yes points: (1) environment;,btohqsg
I think got several ppl misinterpreted this question,btohqsg
there's probably more points but those are at the top of my head when i see the qn,btohqsg
public transport makes transport more convenient,btohqsg
But overall  lean towards it shouldn't be the only one,btohqsg
Will u interpret the questuon wrongly,btohqsg
u can see how poor ppl in villages in africa,btohqsg
have to cross rivers to go to schools,btohqsg
with public transport  it solves the problem,btohqsg
divergence of MSC from MPC but honestly no difference  and this depends on which externality / how you're taught externalities hahaha,btohqsg
i dont see how is wrong,btohqsg
My friend said smth liddat then the examiner like repeat the question liddat,btohqsg
Like as if saying that the point is wrong,btohqsg
u nvr write MEC also  and talk about allocative inefficiency,btohqsg
Then the face like the 'eh why u say that',btohqsg

Eh no they got give the face,btohqsg
I feel like hor they giving like hint hint,btohqsg
Anyways they give face doesnt mean anything oso la,btohqsg
