if u can get things done and do it right  why need to get it done the harsh way,btohqsg
is anyone intentionally being a bitch,btohqsg
those idiots who throw soup at the mona lisa think theyre doing sth honorable,btohqsg
cause they want to stir shit,btohqsg
i had a friend who was like that,btohqsg
they dont think theyre being idiotic,btohqsg
and shes literally 33 years old this year,btohqsg
i mean if u look in the context of stirring shit for fun,btohqsg
that this people esit in the world,btohqsg
then arent we all complicit here,btohqsg
they just want to alert people..they dont care if its good pulbicity or bad publicity,btohqsg
i used to just bully people,btohqsg
like i knew i was bullying someone,btohqsg
but i just felt like it,btohqsg
then when it became a discpline case someone asked me why did i do it i just said idk i felt like it lol,btohqsg
an idiot whos delusional enough to believe shes fighting for whats right,btohqsg
which also means shes all in on the misandry front,btohqsg
which means shes a absolutely horrible person,btohqsg
"they want to let the general public know irregardless of your believe that if one day..shit does hit the fan. they will come back and be able to give the ""i told you so"" to feed their ego",btohqsg
im pretty sure hitler genuinely believed he was right too,btohqsg
so does that excempt him from anything,btohqsg
i think kurt tay also think eat shit is right,btohqsg
Don't gimme a length of projection of kuro's thoughts onto atarax's username,btohqsg
ok but explain to me how this doesnt directly correlate to her being a horrible person  SINCE misogynists are attributed to be horrible people too (her own words too),btohqsg
He was thought how to do vectors,btohqsg
hitler served his military and went to war in ww1..im pretty sure what he thought was right was to give germany a victory because they lost so badly in ww1,btohqsg
Whether he properly learnt it is a different question,btohqsg
qn is why did u voice out your opinions,btohqsg
What is the significance of it,btohqsg
i mean the very concept of misandry (not gender equality) is mostly motte bailey arguments also,btohqsg
HOW AM I GG OFF TANGENT AHHAHAHAHAHAHHA,btohqsg
"that was pretty much what he wanted...literally the playbook of putin...he was a spy when the soviet union fell...now putin wants to build back the soviet union to claim ""victory"" because he knows that is right in his eyes. It was unfair to him the soviet union separated",btohqsg
What does Atarax having a linger name gave di with anything,btohqsg
thats why until today  you realise putin has never recognised the former 15 countries in the soviet union as being independent,btohqsg
And why does kuro voviing out his opinions have to do with anything,btohqsg
Kuro  don't u call me out and just chicken out when I decided to give u the attention u need,btohqsg
I need that attention whore sticker,btohqsg
putin still believes like hitler he can rebuild the very country he served in,btohqsg
Dawg I didn't even realize u asked a qn,btohqsg
Thx for the ted talk rand,btohqsg
i think misandrists are intentionally evil,btohqsg
but when shes doubling down on her fucked up beliefs to the point of delusion,btohqsg
does that not correlate to insanity AND evil,btohqsg
well many people are agreeing with her no?,btohqsg
is okie kuro at this pt    bobian exp,btohqsg
And I APPRECIATE u for it,btohqsg
im glad I adopted a grandpa,btohqsg
no but yeah some ppl tend to push their assumptions on others but idt its exlcusive to ip,btohqsg
just bu yao guan ta men,btohqsg
