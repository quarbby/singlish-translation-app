My contract with KeppelElectric ending. Looking to change new electricity provider.Planning to use UOB one card. Any retailer recommendations?Understand Tuaspower bill comes under SP group. So can get 4.33% when paid through Uob one credit card ?,btohqsg
hi all  just need some advice as i cant seem to find them on some online platforms.Things to note;1) im a freshgrad with savings of <75k2) currently using uob one acc + salary credit3) using UOB LADIES (dining category)So currently im using a UOB LADIES card for dining. I am planning to get a miles cc for other soendings (travel/retail etc) and came across hsbc revol. So here is the qn  if i plan to get the hsbc revol cc  is it worth to open an EGA aswell to try and qualify the 1% cashback (simply by xfering 2k monthly from my uob one acc) ?TLDR  if i have a UOB One acc alrdy and i want a HSBC REVOLUTION CC  is it worth opening an EGA acc and xfer 2k monthly inside to qualify for 1% cashback,btohqsg
Hi everyone  may i ask if i have trouble meeting UOB evol online spending criteria as i do not shop much online  how do i meet this criteria? Can pair with instarem amaze to count it as online spend for daily spend?🙏,btohqsg
Evol cannot pair w Amaze becoz its not Mastercard,btohqsg
right before ur billing cycle ends  and the cashback will then be used to offset ur bill,btohqsg
Is there any other way to get around the online spending for evol if i do not shop much online?,btohqsg
Xnap  Shopback  KFC App  Grab App  Gojek App  MCD App  Fairprice App  CaltexGo App  count as online.,btohqsg
to add on to the list fave  kris+  yakun app  breadtalk group app  foodpanda self pickup or dine in  buy vouchers on shopback/wogi etc,btohqsg
thanks for tips  was looking for more ways to expand the usage,btohqsg
Not worth to scatter around .. focus on UOB one till you have more savings beyond 100k ..my 2 cents.If you need a miles card suggest Citi PM or UOB KF for starters,btohqsg
try to link your daily expenses online. like grab or ntuc app all these in app payments are considered online. or use xnapp app instead of usualy paylah.,btohqsg
hsbc ega no need keep savings,btohqsg
PayLah only use on every Friday morning to collect dividend from DBS 😆,btohqsg

You pair it for what purpose? What do you plan to buy?,btohqsg
to convert to online and save on fx fees,btohqsg
Hi does Amaze usually meet their delivery date? Mine seems to be a few days late so far.,btohqsg
Depends if you can stomach the 2k balance staying and sitting in  HSBC EGA.  (unless u can qualify for premier banking)1% isn't really much   are you planning to use this card often outside of Dining covered by your UOB Lady's ?,btohqsg
"Avoid UOB$ merchants (unlike UOB ladies  u get nth if using UOB KF at UOB$ merch)Also cause ""whitelisted MCCs"" outside of dining or SIA-group txns requires to be ""online"" for 3mpd",btohqsg
basically  i am looking to get a general spending card to pair with my UOB Lady’s. Whether its cashback/miles. My main criteria is 0 min spending and if possible no annual fee. Unsure if you have any other opinions but the HSBC Revolution seem to be the “best” to me. (Open to opinions) Altho i did consider Krisflyer UOB CC (since i have a UOB Kris Savings i opened a while back  but most of my eggs are in UOB One)  but it doesnt fit my abv criteria.I looked at SC Smart but HSBC seems to be more flexible to me. I m not v good w calculating this so i am just curious if there is anyone who made some calculation on whether if opening the HSBC EGA just to put 2k in monthly + the 1% cashback is more optimal than just holding the HSBC Revol alone,btohqsg
General spending then uob prvi lor.And uob kf (why not both).Points pool in UOB,btohqsg
1 thing which is keeping me hesistant is the $5 earn block. So i am looking at other $1 earn block options,btohqsg
UOB KF requires spending of $800 on SIA group so do consider that as part of your requirement but for your case why not get CRMC w Amaze  then transform your lady’s to travel,btohqsg
im not sure if it is updated  but for apple users  does Amaze work?,btohqsg
Problem I foresee with this is you might lose out on two months of interest so  see see ah.. (also need to consider your travelling merchants  UOB KF travel don’t count by MCCs  but look at specific merchants ),btohqsg
