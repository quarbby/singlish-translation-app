Feb Promo:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/169064Mar Promo:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/177120I'm guessing you're referring to Feb Promo since you registered in Feb. Back to Apr Promo t&c  what does it say?,btohqsg
Only base interest will be paid if any withdrawals,btohqsg
But IRAS should still count according to the rumors.,btohqsg
Hi is this still valid? Is it possible to call uob hotline to change the category or is irreversible?,btohqsg
I hope so I specially opened the account for this iras payment,btohqsg
Let's wait for the official announcement,btohqsg
it should  it existed before the card was launched,btohqsg
Does anyone have a heymax referral code?,btohqsg
Hi guys  will i get 4mpd if I use dbs woman's world master card at merchant using apple pay? I think no but just want to confirm.,btohqsg
if not all grabgood orders must pay cash sia..haha,btohqsg
Change Category is by website. Still available but now 4MPD.,btohqsg
Changing now will only take effect in July.,btohqsg
if u mean tap phone at contactless terminal it is mobile contactless  not online  no 4mpd,btohqsg
Hi  I took part in the rising dragon promo which earmarked my funds  does this mean I dont get to transfer it out for better interests in other banks like OCBC post nerf in May?,btohqsg
U can transfer out if u return the cash reward received.,btohqsg
is it worth to do this if my earmark is only until 17 May?,btohqsg
Hi all  new investor hereIntend to use IBKR cash and monthly dca into CSPX or VUAA  which is better?And how much shld i do each mth? Is there an optimal amount for fees?,btohqsg
Of course not.Just topup your account to $150k in may. Endure until 1st June. Then move everything out if u don‚Äôt like Uob one anymore.,btohqsg
Anyone notice the lady solitaire card on the website has a new look? I just received my card last week (old look)..I am new so i am not sure are there changes to this new card?,btohqsg
Look has changed and I think the higher mpd is if you have a lady's account or something as well,btohqsg
the old one looks nicer. anyway no longer 6mpd. they introduced a new bonus miles if u have a lady's saving account  but make no sense to me to lock up my money jus to earn some miles,btohqsg
Thats what they do with uob krisflyer iirc,btohqsg
can i ask for uob lady  the bonus UNI is based on overall category spend / $5 x 9 right ?,btohqsg
USD Fixed Deposit  interest is super high. 5.80% for 2 years. Is it advisable to invest?,btohqsg
If u have usd on hand. Sure. It‚Äôs goodIf u don‚Äôt have usd on hand. It means u have to sell sgd buy usd.This leaves u exposed to usd currency fluctuations. Can go up or down.,btohqsg
Yep. Have to convert. But SGD fixed deposits are atmost 3.5%. So losing 2.3% interest every month,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure this is the right way to view it.Unless u are based in USA and earning sgd then your view might be right.,btohqsg
Let me rephrase.African rand fixed deposits pay 9%pa.Singaporeans living in Singapore totally ignore that. Our fixed deposits pay 3.5%pa.Are we losing 5.5%pa interest by ignoring?,btohqsg
USDSGD is pretty stable. I have a lot in US t bills,btohqsg
This is a 5 year chart of usd/sgd. Pass your own judgement on whether this is stable enough for u to participate in a usd fixed deposit. There is no right no wrong since it‚Äôs an individual judgement call.,btohqsg
not USD fixed deposit but short dated t bills,btohqsg
Currently UOB One $100K every month get about $420. From May should be about $300 bah.,btohqsg
Just talked about my uob one acct few days ago here only then they nerf it liao kaozz...,btohqsg

Are you a priority customer? The general esaver promo also gives 3.45% but doesn't need 100k ADB. üòÇ,btohqsg
Morning guys wonder how does ocbc state 4.65% EIR for 100kFor salary credit + save + spendI tot it would be 4.6% (2.5 + 1.5 +0.6),btohqsg
How to buy usd t bills?,btohqsg
Now which bank is the highest interest rate?,btohqsg
For NTUC snack  the 14 days free look is calendar or working days?,btohqsg
Calender days. But note the ‚Äústarts 7 days from policy delivery‚Äù,btohqsg
For big spend on mcc 5944 (jewelry) seems like dbs altitude is still the best right?,btohqsg
Otherwise  I think can split up payment as below1. HSBC Revo - $1k2. Citi Rewards - $1k3. DBS Altitude - $3k (for new to card promo 60k miles)4. UOB krisflyer - remaining?,btohqsg
Do you need to amaze the Citi rewards card?Perhaps search chat history ‚Äú5944‚Äù will give you some clues.,btohqsg
Dbs vantage (new signup) 85k miles,btohqsg
