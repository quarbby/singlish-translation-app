I mean yea 2k for that is on the higher end but still reasonable,btohqsg
You seen a one room before? There's no bedroom,btohqsg
A one room hdb is a living room+ kitchen,btohqsg
which mrt is it near to,btohqsg
Yea as I suspect it's not for long term lease,btohqsg
This is a hdb one room  one of the better ones,btohqsg
current hdb layout all vv small,btohqsg
The worst ones are where the one room is the size of that kitchen,btohqsg
Not as bad as the cage homes,btohqsg
At first I thought no advertising only applies to the study chat and not this until I reread the rules,btohqsg
That means tuition cannot recommend here even if ppl ask?,btohqsg
Oh ic so it’s stuff like property advertising that’s out of bounds,btohqsg
I'm very sure if people request should be ok,btohqsg
If not you gonna have people flooding the chat with tuition promos,btohqsg
But then like if ppl come here to self advertise their own tuition services that’s not allowed?@junghon3709,btohqsg
"yea then we shld change the name to ""SGExams advertisement group""",btohqsg
maybe got to seek admin perm first,btohqsg
I think private tuition services will be redirected to other channels,btohqsg
And these other channels have been vetted,btohqsg
You mean yes? Cos I said not allowed there,btohqsg
https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/s/5Ih7jSlTeihonestly can't tell whether this is satire,btohqsg
"I mean if people ask for services here and they get replies with "" sorry can't answer"" or ""sorry can't say here"". That's the fastest Convo ender in history",btohqsg
Better than light soya sauce in soft boiled eggs,btohqsg
Bruh.. the dark soya sauce is the only way,btohqsg
If it ain't brown it ain't good,btohqsg
Seen a mf pour that in to their Kopi C,btohqsg
Correct me.if I'm wrong but ain't the variety in their country even worse,btohqsg
im in cce its very boring,btohqsg

bro I have to contact yappertron as the (cca i hate the most kuro don’t expose me),btohqsg
Directed to ppl in elite sch bc I can’t compare,btohqsg
Yes. In fact in some top tier JCs it’s the default and students have to appeal to not take 4H2,btohqsg
Unfortunately for me only Malays get half day today,btohqsg
I see E120 doing the thing gude does,btohqsg
Can I identify as a Malay today,btohqsg
Ok la maybe no half day but I can reward myself with an extra long lunch break,btohqsg
I’ll leave office for 2h and hope no one catches,btohqsg
(like gude tamago jc or bmtjc),btohqsg
I get office all day every day,btohqsg

Gonna go out and have a rokok break with my abang and then later have sex at Blk 38 HDB staircase/s,btohqsg
Some Malays in my unit literally just go outside of the compound to smoke,btohqsg
i thought thats for jae  if your ip results too rabs they wont let you take 4h2,btohqsg
like you barely passed ip4 they will let you promote but not 4h2,btohqsg
Idk tho I heard in RJC that ppl have to appeal to not take 4H2,btohqsg
I mean it's a stereotype for a reason lmao,btohqsg
Also for whatever reason Malays are over represented at scdf (and I heard spf),btohqsg
oh my rgs friend said in rjc if your rgs/ri ip4 results too bad they will strongly encourage (ask you to) do 3h2,btohqsg
Oh maybe it’s for those IP students who do well they have to appeal to do 3H2,btohqsg
