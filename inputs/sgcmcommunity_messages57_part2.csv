A4 and A5 is the same actually. Just exterior  one is sportback  one is sedan. Comfort  go for A4. Sporty and low  A5. Do note A5 is a low slung car.. and low.. low .. low..,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like 3 and 4 series lor haha,btohqsg
but 4 series the bigger boot does it for me,btohqsg
had one for awhile  freaking loved it,btohqsg
Yuppp  but the taillights slightly different for b9.5 a5 compared to the A4,btohqsg
ngl i not a big fan of audis,btohqsg
Sadly PA doesn't let you spec but you can change out to wooden panels as well,btohqsg
but the b7 rs4 forever one of my fave audis,btohqsg
dependent on personal preference.. some ppl like mercedes  some like audi  some like bmw .. some like volvos etc.,btohqsg
but u saying this cos u had one right,btohqsg
ya they damn .. ?!$& say need indent ‚Ä¶ need wait .. must take their stock .. if not must wait for next batch shipping etc.,btohqsg
Anyone knows a 3-4 year old A5 2.0 Design roughly how much the depre should be,btohqsg
So anything more is ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù alr?,btohqsg
They range between late 19s to early 21k,btohqsg
yall cute but i like toyota more,btohqsg
19K - 22K (From my viewpoint),btohqsg
i love toyota raize  faster than M and AMG cars,btohqsg
Make sure to look at mileage and service history if buying now,btohqsg
Someone I know had transmission oil issues as soon as they bought because previous owner never service,btohqsg
Eh I got tourador on the left side of mine,btohqsg
My friend changed to using greentrac without telling me. That night he went through corners and all  i didn‚Äôt knew it was a chinese tyre!,btohqsg
Then they put both the stickers on,btohqsg
maybe F1 shld do that too,btohqsg
One side pirelli other side Michelin,btohqsg
Then is your LBWK sticker between those stickers too?,btohqsg
Great to hear some good reviews about them too. Always heard bad reviews especially in the wet,btohqsg
I think dry grip still ok with touradors but wet and heavy braking cannot make it,btohqsg
I only break kickball record in primary school,btohqsg
arnav i think ur car the doctor gearbox one issit,btohqsg
drive like one dog then when crash free gearbox overhaul ah,btohqsg
He told me in the wet is damn good also. But .. need wait for time to tell whether the longevity is good or not.245/35/19 + 275/30/19 = $560,btohqsg
Same size as me Michelin is $1480,btohqsg
I wouldn't go for them personally because of trust issues,btohqsg
But would be nice to hear,btohqsg
no eh. hahah. i‚Äôll remain stock.,btohqsg
if you have upgrades i personally think sticking to low profile is worth the ride comfort hahaha,btohqsg
I have too much mechanical sympathy to do that,btohqsg
Fwd spinning in the wet is next level,btohqsg
fwd‚Ä¶ i no extra $100 000 for quattro,btohqsg
üòÇ siao eh.. PA quattro model another 6 digits that time,btohqsg
It's sad knowing that in other markets the differential is sub 20k,btohqsg
Then their specs also damn basic most of the time,btohqsg
If you want to spec they really try to push their in stock car more,btohqsg
Actually  Audi Singapore .. their inventory .. are mostly somewhat .. base models,btohqsg
Next time base model will have subscription based AC in sg,btohqsg
You see those normal B9 A4 on the roads  the grille black colour one  no chrome. that is a base model to european countries.,btohqsg
They sell it as a style pack,btohqsg
Gloss black grille also need to pay extra,btohqsg
Ok leh black nicer than chrome.,btohqsg
Even if i buy chrome end up dechrome...,btohqsg
