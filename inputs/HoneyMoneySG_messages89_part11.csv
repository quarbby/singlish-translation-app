Only Android can add digital card to Gpay. Tough luck for Apple pay.,btohqsg
Other than DBS Altitude that allow Lounge Access to Card Holder + 1 Guest for free  what other card allows it?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúFree lounge‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Ok i search for it. Tq!,btohqsg
if you qualify and are willing to spend on annual fee and know how go maximise the credits given  can also try amex platinum charge card that gives unlimited access. hefty annual fee but the benefits outweigh cost if you know how to squeeze all the benefits,btohqsg
Lounge access through credit card is largely over rated üòÇ,btohqsg
Dbs also have but their benefits quite bad now,btohqsg
Hi  for the HSBC Luna new year EGA promo -  does it mean that my incremental adb in Feb compared to Jan  will also be the amount that earn bonus in March as well ?,btohqsg
Haha why? I enjoyed my loungr access last yr at Doha.,btohqsg
Ok just checked  only DBS Altitude  CitibankPremier Miles and SC Journey Card,btohqsg
Hello guys  if i took a flight with ANA under the star alliance partners  will i be able to backdate and claim miles with krisflyer?,btohqsg
Btw  those CC that mentioned first year annual fee waived  does that mean subsequent year annual fee cannot be waived?,btohqsg

Just buy this S$6 DTAC sim and collect at changi airporthttps://www.changirecommends.com/deal.aspx?id=30154,btohqsg
hey Chris thanks for the prompt reply  much appreciated!!,btohqsg
Haha dunno leh the food inside is subpar rather go eat restaurant. Ok la long layover is useful.,btohqsg
Subsequent years subject to approval. I and some others here had their SCB X Card / Journey annual fee waiver rejected recently.,btohqsg
Subjected to approval by banks. They can choose not to waive it,btohqsg
Have anyone applied OCBC cc and get instant approval? I just applied and get instant approval immediately and it ask to retrieve my digital card.. but I dunno what‚Äôs the correct place to enter the code - OCBC credit card product webpage and enter this code XXXXXXXX,btohqsg
For OCBC  they got stated annual spending must be $10 000 to waive ü§≠,btohqsg
On their website  click on the card you applied,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Found it. I surprise that instant approval  I tot must wait few days,btohqsg
The bring one guest is free?,btohqsg
Hi guys  between moomoo cash plus  syfe cash guarantee  tiger  stash away  which is the best one to park cash temporarily?,btohqsg
Overated or not  it's still better to use the lounge before boarding the plane. Where would you rather wait ?,btohqsg
In your example  you will get 3.6% for Feb and March.,btohqsg
I normally search on Klook or shopee and read the reviews. Esp for e-sim I prefer to ensure everything is good and activate the moment I land rather than changing physical sim and queuing up to buy one. Airalo and the likes can be expensive. Local telco AIS and DTAC has eSIM for tourist too  head over to their official website to check it out. If you use TikTok during travel  I will avoid circleslife jetpac plan (and any online shop that issues the sim from Mainland or HK) as they will block TikTok.,btohqsg
Ok it‚Äôs a personal preference at the end of the day. Trying to say no pt getting a credit card just to get lounge access by 3rd party providers like PP. unlike those provided as part of flying premium  lounge like PP not great with overcrowding and poor quality. I rather wait at the restaurants in the airport.,btohqsg
Has anyone here emailed SNACK about why the Li Cun challenge doesn't reflect to challenge history after fulfilling the requirements?,btohqsg
if they rejected waiver and we choose to terminate  do we need to pay pro rated annual fee then?,btohqsg
Is safra cc good to have as a spare if ur looking for Mastercard and without annual fee?,btohqsg
That's what I'm doing now  out of convenience. 3% cashback on most generic spending and benefits as SAFRA member included.,btohqsg
Yuu card visa just did an auto annual fee reversal. Don‚Äôt even need to call in to them. Nice.,btohqsg
Nice. I went to apply at app but it shows unable to confirm ur safra membership. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Hi  would like to ask on CPF SA shielding method. If let say SA already at FRS (not all amount under reserved) but i would like to still be able to enjoy 8k relief annually. Can I shield my SA 8k then top up SA 8k annually for tax relief?,btohqsg
If you hit FRS  you can no longer top up to your SA via RSTU. So you cannot get more tax relief.You can continue to top up your MA if you still have allowance as well as top up your loved ones.CPF shielding is done at age of 55 so not sure what your question is actually.,btohqsg
So for those who had gone for the OA transfer to SA method  the cons is that they can't enjoy the $8k tax relief in their later stage of life.,btohqsg
Invested amounts for SA are calculated as part of the RSTU cap if that's what you're asking.,btohqsg
What i mean is to reduce SA to be below FRS (investing out) and then top up SA using cash for tax relief. But not sure if this can be done üòÖ,btohqsg
Once SA hit FRS  then cannot get tax relief on top up to self SA. But the money in SA can effectively compound at max. You can explore other tax relief like1) top up your own MA to BHS2) top up loved ones SA/RA (rstu)3) top up to SRS account,btohqsg
If you have cannot get tax relief from CPF topups (VCMA/RSTU) anymore  you can look into topping up SRS and investing it.,btohqsg
You will not be able to reduce by investing your SA account. Dun think there is any known loop hole on this. üòÖ,btohqsg
Ah ok..so investing out doesnt reduce the total amount. Got it. Thank youüôè,btohqsg
Ok will look into this option. Thank youüôè,btohqsg
Can also add nomad esim for ur consideration.Thailand 50gb for 10 days by DTACUS $8,btohqsg
currently on promo but not the cheapest.,btohqsg
FRS = Amount in SA account + any amount withdraw for other purpose.,btohqsg
Another one bites the dust...!BannedJian Hao.,btohqsg
No need  as annual fee is for upcoming year  not past year.,btohqsg
