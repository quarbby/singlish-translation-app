hi guys can i ask as a J1 how much time shld we dedicate to revise during dec hols,btohqsg
Anyone needs like geog ss notes,btohqsg
ngl wld advise you to just catch up on whatever you are lacking after you receive your promo results and do light revision - you wouldnâ€™t want to burn out before J2s. personally  studied more than my peers during dec hols and burnt out earlier which was not worth it,btohqsg
tbh just enjoy dec holidays and really rest and get ready for J2,btohqsg
Imo use Ur time to recap wtv ur weak in then relax before the stress begin in j2,btohqsg
U deserve a break also. Maybe try with half the number of hours during term time?,btohqsg
Make sure u dun forget j1 work..,btohqsg
