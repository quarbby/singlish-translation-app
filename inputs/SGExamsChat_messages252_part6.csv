i thought ntu alr got fixed majors w certain minors,btohqsg
nus u can choose whatever minor and major u want,btohqsg
But getting awarded the minor or major then I not sure,btohqsg
i got someone in my course studying chem with math major and thai minor,btohqsg
Sounds like an interest thing bah,btohqsg
NUS allow max 1 more major and 3 minors,btohqsg
But ya NTU CBC is not biochem,btohqsg
I don't think there's any biochem specialised major in SG,btohqsg
2 major 3 minor lets go,btohqsg
There's only 1 biochem module in y1,btohqsg
All the chemistry they teach can take place in the body that's why they say biological chemistry lol,btohqsg
thanks for letting me know. Honestly I was quite surprised about it.,btohqsg
Yea if you wanna do biochem related  probably overseas or branch into it after degree,btohqsg
Like if you gonna do postgrad  maybe can find if there's any such masters involved or do PhD with a prof doing biochem-related,btohqsg
"That's usually how people specialise within a ""subject"" focus",btohqsg
And not specialise as in concentration or what ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
I'm dying from my mum's nagging,btohqsg
