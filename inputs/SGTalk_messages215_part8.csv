no leh  i think certain things like taking care of your own baby should be done by daddys  not helpers,btohqsg
When u come hm frm work  damn sian that time  then say ok?,btohqsg
Taking care of our children shoud be done by both mother n father……,btohqsg
All u want is hot shower  hot food and play game.,btohqsg
Helpers are gd  but dont rely on them like 98%,btohqsg
Helpers do the mundane tasks so you hv time to spend w children. Not on phone or games.,btohqsg
I will take my husband phone away if hes always on hp,btohqsg
yes agree.... these days  parents like to just throw everything to helper,btohqsg
Generally  i feel daddys are learning their job..so need to give some credits ya….,btohqsg
Actually as long as both party have a clear line on what each other’s role are   should be ok. Some dads like to play with their kids  make themselves look childish doing so. But some are more stern and uptight and don’t want to appear this way. Doesn’t make him a worse dad. Maybe he’s better at teaching life values to his child in the future ? Don’t know how to change diaper or cook can compensate by treating the wife better knowing that she bears that burden. Each party has their role to play.,btohqsg
Agree. My BIL only contributed his sperms. Period.,btohqsg
wonder why my sis yet to dump him,btohqsg
He got life policy half a mil,btohqsg
Suddenly craving an iced latte no sugar,btohqsg
