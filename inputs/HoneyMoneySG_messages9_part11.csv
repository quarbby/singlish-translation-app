oh nvm  I found the explanation,btohqsg
You should have told us its UOB  UOb has a unique fcy definition,btohqsg
Care to uncrop it so we can read context?,btohqsg
I cropped the relevant section just to save others some time ü§£,btohqsg
As i said  its for context,btohqsg
sure  my bad  you may check the link above ü§£,btohqsg
Anw Best to just share with the community what you found: for e.g. citi master card transactions processed outside Singapore or with overseas merchants will be subject to 1% fee‚Ä¶So we all learn togetherThanks julia,btohqsg
Thanks for the summary. I'll take note next time üëå,btohqsg
But why use citi on qgoda?,btohqsg
I was naive....so which card would you recommend?,btohqsg
If agoda sgd i would use DBS WWMC,btohqsg
ah yes  but I just didn't have that card at that time ü§£,btohqsg
I wish I joined this group earlier,btohqsg
what are the difference between Amex Kriflyer and High Flyer card? what are the considerations in choosing?,btohqsg
Main difference are on miles rate and 1 is personal 1 is business card,btohqsg
Would this be a better deal actually?,btohqsg
You would need to compare the prices between Citi x Agoda landing page VS an incognito mode pure Agoda page  then see if the additional miles are worth it. Sometimes  the price difference may surprise you,btohqsg
But I thought we only able to book via the link from citi agoda,btohqsg
Hi. What do y‚Äôall use to pay for utilities and insurance (term plans  investment plans etc)?,btohqsg
That is if you want to get the Citi 7 mpd promo. For some  saving in absolute cost may be the priority,btohqsg
Yea and depends what you are using the miles for: if you are redeeming anything from SQ biz class to suites which is worth anywhere from 2-8 cents per mile (based on milelion)  then the higher price on agoda might be worth it if it costs below the value of your redemption,btohqsg
My intuition is that if savings in absolute costs is of utmost priority  then cash back cards would make more sense than miles,btohqsg
Hi all  Citi Rewards + Amaze use for local dining  will qualify for 10X?,btohqsg
Does anyone use DBS's My Preferred Payment Plan before on CC?,btohqsg
Any points / powerup for grabpay > bigpay  and bigpay > grabpay?,btohqsg

I asked few time here no one reply me yet üòÜ,btohqsg
I assume can  but Ill wait for the next grabpay challenge to try out,btohqsg
You just test a small amount lah,btohqsg
You able to add GPMC to top up EZ-Link MC‚ùì,btohqsg
Will this be better or the 18% Cashback one üòÇ,btohqsg

üò° grabpay card for travel insurance got no points,btohqsg
well expected as insurance is usually excluded for rewardsü§£,btohqsg
but you can get cashback from AMEX  which I guess is what Ben meant,btohqsg
Can I ask for credit card payment  is it good idea to pay for credit card bill via AXS with GrabPay to earn 1.7% cashback with UOB Absolute?,btohqsg
I am concerned that the bill will eventually get larger and larger very soon since next month you still need to pay back the whole amount and it will eat up the $30000 grab pay limit very soon,btohqsg
say every month you spend 2k  after 5 months 2+4+6+8+10 = 30k you already hit the limit...,btohqsg
Btw  grab 30k limit is based on calendar year  while wise and revolut are rolling based. So can plan the limit better.,btohqsg
I was trying to search for a grabpay alternative which can accept either amex or diners club and also come with a mastercard or visa card to spend with... But sadly no another app can do this in singapore.,btohqsg
Oh I nvr thought about this  what if we just pay cc bills via AXS using grabpay that is topped up via paynow? At least can get grab points,btohqsg
Hello do you guys know if it‚Äôs ok to apply or hold too many credit cards at one ? Applying them within a short span from one another really affect credit score ?,btohqsg
as long as you can get approved and always pay your bills in time  it should be fine,btohqsg
Can anyone share their cashback credit card stack? üòÖ,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think grab give you points for credit card payment tho. Do they?,btohqsg
Not sure myself  just going off GS's idea above,btohqsg
Anyone using endowus and in negative?Im using srs via endowus to invest,btohqsg
My frens alsoWe didnt customize portfolio jus opted for one of the default onesModerate risk,btohqsg
yea  markets across the world have been going down for the last 7 months.,btohqsg
