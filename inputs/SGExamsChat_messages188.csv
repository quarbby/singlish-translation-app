I drew like that sia got 1 mark or no? I gave legend too,btohqsg
some dont require it  some do,btohqsg
Wait isn't the whole thing wrg,btohqsg
oxygen should also share 2 electrons,btohqsg
Uh i dont think its supposed to be like that,btohqsg
what u drew was a 'dative' bond,btohqsg
at least you drew a cute bond,btohqsg
Yes Bedok Viewan is very capable of that,btohqsg
pure chem i heard ppl got baited by beth and the q2 equation 2 for nitrogen dioxide,btohqsg
The one that ask u find which is wrong,btohqsg
I wrote dilute acid instead of concentrated,btohqsg
Cant go seab beat them up to ask to change back my answers anyways,btohqsg
Can somebody explain this concept to me,btohqsg
Go watch youtube video on it,btohqsg
The higher refractive index results in a smaller critical angle,btohqsg
So lower probability of achieving those angles,btohqsg
But how does that affect total internal reflection,btohqsg
the errors are step 3  5 and 7,btohqsg
step 3 the error shld be the warming part,btohqsg
reaction of conc h2so4 and iron is heavily exothermic,btohqsg
ok first of all do you understand the meaning of total internal reflections,btohqsg
i mean just assume it as a normal reaction lor,btohqsg
no need think too deep one,btohqsg
if u argue that conc h2so4,btohqsg
yep so i guess if u write dilute it shld be ok,btohqsg
Whether acid metal reaction give u fe2+ or fe3+,btohqsg
cos conc will probably cos fe to become fe3+ instead of fe2+,btohqsg
I ask my teacher before about iron and acid reaction  cos got two oxidation state  he say just put Fe2+   but he accepted both Fe3+ and Fe2+,btohqsg
i think need warm a bit also to introduce reaction also,btohqsg
Large quantity of water is wrong.IDT u're suppose to warm the solution cos it's alr super conc,btohqsg
And crystal shld be green issit,btohqsg
No  refractive index is speed of light in vacuum divided by the speed of light in the medium,btohqsg
lmao i didnt even notice the wrongcolors,btohqsg
Wait isnt iron ii sulfate FeSo4,btohqsg
i believe this qn is just,btohqsg
O lebel no need to know this,btohqsg
Iron 2 or 3 still can what,btohqsg
ah aside from steps error is also got written error,btohqsg
i think if the error is fair u shld get the marks,btohqsg
yep from the looks of it,btohqsg
Large quantity of waterCrystal should be green not brownWrong formulaShouldn't warm the concentrated solution,btohqsg
Ya everytime i just write acid cher ask to write dilute acid,btohqsg
I also think of the formula at furst,btohqsg
tbh idt u will get penalised ba as long as u include the formula being wrong also,btohqsg
True  but I don't think that's the answer they were aiming for,btohqsg
i believe they wanted students to also identify that the formula is wrong,btohqsg
Conc acid cannot warm ncos can splatter and very explosive,btohqsg
but idt any student will write it,btohqsg
Is like changing the expeirment reagent,btohqsg
u will prob be mentioned in examiner report then !!,btohqsg
But the confirm correct one is the formula and colour,btohqsg
Those 3 should be the answer key,btohqsg
Den the rest they may accept,btohqsg
IDT they intended us to change the acid,btohqsg
Where are the bonding electrons from O?,btohqsg
'Only 1 candidate  in particular  from Bedok View Secondary  talked on the ramifications of warming of concentrated sulfuric acid  given the extremely exothermic nature of the reaction  which came as a pleasant surprise to the marker marking the said candidate's answer script'.,btohqsg
i rmb how 2012 a lvl chem examiner report,btohqsg
the diastereoisomer  only 3 ppl in singapore got it.,btohqsg
You have transitioned well into your new identity as an ACSian,btohqsg
the S in ACS stands for $$$$,btohqsg
Acjc calls their kids acsians too,btohqsg
wait till u see pure science syllabus examiner reports,btohqsg
esp for o lvl pure bio,btohqsg
a lot of ppl use a lvl bio terms in o lvl pure bio,btohqsg
which was mentioned in examiner report,btohqsg
How can u even use a lvl terms ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
there are ppl who used uni lvl stuff for a lvls,btohqsg
it works  and u wont be penalised,btohqsg
no one said u can't what,btohqsg
just like how i wrote 'LOL' for a definition qn i didnt intend to do for h2 chem,btohqsg
and how my fren wrote 'merry christmas' at the end of his econs essay,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t the O levels explanation just â€˜itzliddatâ€™,btohqsg
Tbh idk what's the o level explaination anymore,btohqsg
Higher mass result in stronger intermolecular force?,btohqsg
instead of saying id-id/pd-d/h bonding just say imf,btohqsg
Yall know the answer for the flow chartt??,btohqsg
Calm down ur still taking o lvl ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
lol i screw up my dot and cross diagram,btohqsg
just like my pure chem student. jk,btohqsg
Did u do the 20 plus Chem papers u got from ur sch,btohqsg
Wth sia damn weak in tat kimd of qns leh so difficult  man,btohqsg
i just realise i draw wrongly ðŸ¥ºdk what's wrong with me,btohqsg
Wrong! The O- faces the Zn2+ ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Idk  I forgot the o level way,btohqsg
How did I even flex ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
determine the average charge on a single O atom in the carbonate anion,btohqsg
i preparing u for h2 chem,btohqsg
Wonâ€™t draw dot-and-cross disgram for Zn because the third shell will have 18 e,btohqsg
Guys for the sodium question for combi science. Is it oxidised reduced or neither of them?,btohqsg
I put neither of them wat abt u,btohqsg
but i think sec 5 kid is correct,btohqsg
u only look with respect to 1 atom,btohqsg
Oh ya it was 0 i tot is +1 at first,btohqsg
HAHAHA shit liao u got eae?,btohqsg
And wtf is with ur usernameðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
7 days to prepare for mcq ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
anyone has the combined chem paper?,btohqsg
the study grp if ur in,btohqsg
So what paper do u guys have tmr?,btohqsg
Tmr is bio n hist according to my brother,btohqsg
Yea im exempted from history n bio,btohqsg
Time for me to change subject,btohqsg
Well good luck to those taking double pure for those two,btohqsg
What abt average charge of BF3?,btohqsg
I just saw a sneak peak of the history paper. The essay question is on Imperial Japan and Cold war. My father show me,btohqsg
oh my classmate took that :_ well gd luck,btohqsg
Is your father perhaps a cambridge man for the castle of cummings,btohqsg
Are you talking about formal charge,btohqsg
Yes my father is a Cambridge marker,btohqsg
Dei that's not the actual charge la,btohqsg
I guess maybe not so clear,btohqsg
is your father a cummings man from the castle of cambridge?,btohqsg
ask him to show u comb phy paper and tell us,btohqsg
ask your father to show us answers for rest of the o level paed,btohqsg
i thgt it came out last yr tho,btohqsg
Average charge is just average charge,btohqsg
Something that deserved to be nuked,btohqsg
any kind soul would like to share with me history notes,btohqsg
omg is that V from sam willows,btohqsg
Jay  how old are u sia,btohqsg
He ale out of NS right,btohqsg
i thought of hitlerâ€™s germany rise to power and impact of his polices,btohqsg
Jay is having his great grandson in March,btohqsg
I think i alr became boomer cos of sgexams,btohqsg
but i lowkey dropped that idea,btohqsg
Which topic have u not touched at all,btohqsg
I can send u a good summary for cold war,btohqsg
even if i see the summary,btohqsg
my seq cold war still die de,btohqsg
6/20 for korean war seq even with the help of my textbook,btohqsg
kek for prelim i wrote 1 line for essay wn and ogt 3m,btohqsg
Best thing u can do rn is to note the key events and just get the gist of the points,btohqsg
but fingers crossed seq will be on the chpts u studied,btohqsg
If Japan comes out Iâ€™m dead,btohqsg
Just know how japan Lost the war all,btohqsg
Can talk about the atomic bomb on hiroshima,btohqsg
Idk i think they will test On The Japanese occupation of Singapore,btohqsg
r u people all elec his,btohqsg
lol I donâ€™t know anything on that,btohqsg
If it comes out Iâ€™ll sleep during history paper,btohqsg
Last year 2019 i think it was cold war n japan,btohqsg
So this year i think hitler n ww2,btohqsg
yea but he was so weird LOL,btohqsg
the possibility is actl like 50-50,btohqsg
Somebody compared Donald Trump to Hitler. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I don't even take hist ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
My hand continuously tourtured for 2 straight days and tmr thr is ph p1,btohqsg
SEQ.2014 - 8&92015 - 8&102016 - 8&112017 - 8&92018 - 92019 - 8&11This is just an analysis. *Not a conclusion*. And it only means that you can focus MORE on some but should know the rest.*Always expect the unexpected*,btohqsg
my teachers' analysis for combined history,btohqsg
Haha my mum never allow ice at home,btohqsg
Huh  there's no ice at home?,btohqsg
I thought every freezer will have ice haha,btohqsg
Nope my mum don't allow me to prepare ice,btohqsg
Cuz she say is not good for health...,btohqsg
So is always warm water or room tem water,btohqsg
What  how do u keep water warm,btohqsg
Add hot water Everytime u want drink?,btohqsg
Then add abit of rtp water,btohqsg
I have a friend in sec sch,btohqsg
Who drinks like 60 degree water,btohqsg
There was once I run out of water,btohqsg
Den I open his bottle and drink,btohqsg
Not boiling laz but damn hot,btohqsg
Hi to the person who asked if hitlerâ€™s foreign policy = hitlerâ€™s expansionist policy  his expansionist policy is one of his foreign policy i.e. Lebensraum but also includes revision of TOV and uniting German speakers,btohqsg
Yo those taking exam in 2020 regardless: PSLE / GCE-level exams y'all  can view your results online according to moe...Evidence:https://bit.ly/31O8mBs,btohqsg
Online not as exciting as physically,btohqsg
MOE said that students can also return to their respective schools to collect their results as it recognises that doing so marks an important milestone.Those who wish to collect their results in person can do so in individual classrooms instead of large crowded venues  such as the school hall. They will have to comply with safe management practices.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/results-for-2020-national-examinations-will-be-released-online-and,btohqsg
U can't view it earlier can you,btohqsg
If u are private candidate u sure can?,btohqsg
Well private candidate at 11am can get alr,btohqsg
My brother gonna be the next one standing at the post office HAHA,btohqsg
Anyone have summary notes for history ?,btohqsg
i took it a few yrs back and can also view my gce o/a lvl results,btohqsg
Cuz now ...they got the singpass to check results.,btohqsg
Well at least I dont need to cry in front of my school...,btohqsg
Id much rather be in sch to collect results,btohqsg
My classmates did reasonably well  so no one to cry with lmao,btohqsg
*stares at my H1 GP result*,btohqsg
Do it on the last day of Os,btohqsg
you will forever be in the clutches of bedok view,btohqsg
I think a lot of people wont go honestly,btohqsg
my last day of exam 4 dec i think,btohqsg
I got 5 more papers to go,btohqsg
Wah how yall got so many more papers,btohqsg
i dare u not touch a lvl chem for 2 yrs straight next yr onwards,btohqsg
lol u cant run away from such qns,btohqsg
even uni i also kenna definition and its 5 marks LOL,btohqsg
ok la take physics in a lvls,btohqsg
if u top 10 in singapore,btohqsg
Idk my level too low to even know,btohqsg
If you get 101/100 for an o level paper u get A* instead of A1,btohqsg
I think bedok is the only person in history who got that grade,btohqsg
he wrote a manifesto so throbbing,btohqsg
that he immidiately became Prime minister of every country,btohqsg
Seriously got better than A1 meh,btohqsg
But counted as A1 also right,btohqsg
Worst comes to worst talk about hitlerâ€™s missing testicle,btohqsg
ah thatâ€™s one of the reasons for germanyâ€™s defeat,btohqsg
stalin made fun of hitlerâ€™s pp,btohqsg
hitler got sad and shot himself,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s a chapter 8 ? HAJSHAKHAA,btohqsg
what the hell this is the standard you need to take fm,btohqsg
93 at o levels for promos?,btohqsg
nono I'm pretty sure he/she is IP programme,btohqsg
it's an ig post from friend,btohqsg
im not gonna take fmath even if my am em a1,btohqsg
bc i heard its tough af even for h2 math alr tho,btohqsg
it's just fun to solve really tough maths,btohqsg
& no way am i gonna get like a E or U bc i cant do fmath,btohqsg
i rather get C or D for math h2,btohqsg
Lol imagine a bio guy doing fmaths,btohqsg
Like so difficult that most people canâ€™t even score above 50%,btohqsg
but you can take bio alone,btohqsg
I thought someone with a background with phy will be more ready,btohqsg
Im pretty much forced into BCME or BCMG LOL,btohqsg
you can be really strong at phy but suck and maths,btohqsg
cause physics is more of practical but maths is theoretical,btohqsg
that's why similanjiao also need round off,btohqsg
Screw this crap I might seriously go to polytechnic,btohqsg
Entry to university free from all this a level crap,btohqsg
Instead of retaining can i go back to kindergarten,btohqsg
looks like some Olympiad number theory shit,btohqsg
All the best doing bio tml.,btohqsg
This is not even rigourous mathematics,btohqsg
it's just some crazy ass manipulation,btohqsg
That font is oddly familiar. I don't like it.,btohqsg
We do integration all the time,btohqsg
What's this supposed to even mean?,btohqsg
Yes we have to deal with imaginary shit all the time,btohqsg
Yeah just to add more reasons to learn math,btohqsg
To argue thereâ€™s an angle in the imaginary world,btohqsg
1+80n must be a perfect square. Let k = m^2 - n^2. Then we have (k-1)(k+1)=80n where both k and n are positive integers. Since 80=5Ã—2^4  k-1 and k+1 must be even numbers. Now  let k-1=2u where u is again a positive integer.So we now have u(u+1)=20n.  Remember that m^2 = 1+2u+n^2.Since u(u+1) is a multiple of 10  u can only end in 4  5  9 or 0. We have therefore greatly reduced our choices.It doesn't take many tries (3 in fact) to find that n=19 and m=20.,btohqsg
ok i dont get it lol,btohqsg
i think can use m>n fact,btohqsg
Ya then you can easily get the range of n to be like within 19,btohqsg
What's the clt for elective hist,btohqsg
Since m>n  then m> or = n+1. So like 80n+1=(m^2-n^2)^2> or = ((n+1)^2-n^2)^2.Which is an inequality in n and can be solved to show n< or = 19,btohqsg
elective hist clt seem to be end of cold war,btohqsg
Sup if anyone took comb chem and is interested in checking answers can pm me :) hue,btohqsg
Oh i found another pretty fun way. But it requires extensive knowledge on Pythagoras triplets. By completing the square we have(m^2-n^2)^2+(40n)^2=(1+40n)^2Since all the inputs are Pythagorean triplets  we must have 40n=2mn and 1+40n=m^2+n^2. So m=20 and we need to solve n^2-40n+399=0. Which gives n=19.,btohqsg
Stalin not out of syllabus yet?,btohqsg
There is a lot of points,btohqsg
The typeface is called 'Computer Modern' by the wayMing HuiI think you are just not used to the typeface. I personally think it is beautiful. Perhaps you associate Computer Modern with 'challenging mathematics',btohqsg
I'm long used to it lmao,btohqsg
I would like to share with everyone,btohqsg
About the retrieval of the GCE papers result,btohqsg
It would be done online or in smaller groups in school like in the classroom instead of the hall,btohqsg
If anyone have o level combined sci bio paper can send?,btohqsg
Found ans to chem paper 2 at miss Chen sci tuition website,btohqsg
what came out for pure history 2019?,btohqsg
has any topics come out double years? for pure hist,btohqsg
I think Stalin SBQ and Hitler and outbreak of ww2 SRQ and another SRQ is malaya,btohqsg
Oh make sense I tot since when combined history now so hard,btohqsg
so possible for hitler to come out for sbq even if it came out as sbq last year?,btohqsg
so sbq this year maybe stalin isit?,btohqsg
should i drink milo or juice,btohqsg
That will make u run to toliet,btohqsg
I tot was smth like smoothie juice or smth,btohqsg
For a while u feel energised,btohqsg
U shld know this as a bio student,btohqsg
Is the same as how after eatin durin recess  subsequent lessons ppl feel like toh-ing,btohqsg
Artificial sweetener is just as bad,btohqsg
No wonder i have been answering qns wrong recently!!,btohqsg
I guess is proven true if multiple research studies show that,btohqsg
ya it increases the rate of diffusion of brain juice from the surroundings to the brain,btohqsg
I think if u drink juice right,btohqsg
Ur blood high in sugar content,btohqsg
And u being dehydrated from the inside,btohqsg
Ur cells shrink and become plasmolysr,btohqsg
Ok la actually almost all cells,btohqsg
Cann but yea I think SEQ more likely,btohqsg
SBQ right if Hitler come out just know timeline,btohqsg
i heard they onlt test a few topic,btohqsg
Out of 20 chapters  only 3 or 4 came out,btohqsg
Should have just slept for the extra 4 hours I stayed up,btohqsg
"If I did I wouldn't be so upset:""""""",btohqsg
its ok i give u cookie,btohqsg
Everything I studied didn't come out  it's really upsetting:(,btohqsg
Just waiting for them to oneshot pile everything in paper 1,btohqsg
go online find past year paper,btohqsg
heard that pure bio p2 weird,btohqsg
2016 2017 2018 sure avaible liao,btohqsg
Btw any one have elect hist notes,btohqsg
Just going to mug tys lmao,btohqsg
my friend say the things they test,btohqsg
The people that really lost are the triple science elect hist/geog people lmao,btohqsg
Imagine taking three science papers in a row,btohqsg
Thank god i didn't do trip,btohqsg
Im doing double pure and i akrd wanna die,btohqsg
i think i saw u in discord,btohqsg
I was taking double pure and I dropped chem I think it's the best decision I've ever made lmao,btohqsg
Anyone has any O level ppr this yr,btohqsg
Can pm me or send? ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
wait  so u do combine chem and pure bio?,btohqsg
i wan do the paper LOL,btohqsg
u confirm want become tutor right,btohqsg
I did am & comb chem,btohqsg
Cos q interesting to gauge if,btohqsg
he takes all O level subject,btohqsg
and he do triple science also,btohqsg
u gt any can jst send me (excl lit),btohqsg
he aiming for 20 distinction haha,btohqsg
He can legit say his o lvl got 20,btohqsg
i thought u did pretty well in the pop quiz,btohqsg
I fell asleep in the exam,btohqsg
I fell asleep sitting up staring at the paper HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
u aiming for JC or poly?,btohqsg
Lmao that's why im freaking out,btohqsg
if poly still can skip history cos not needed in L1R4 haha,btohqsg
It was literally a few hours ago,btohqsg
does anyone have combine bio paper?,btohqsg
math came out right aft that,btohqsg
Eh what ppr over alr ah,btohqsg
i mean quite a few lo,btohqsg
wah shit its been so long since i joined back this group,btohqsg
how come yall not scared sia everyone profile pics on public view,btohqsg
I thought u taking history later haha,btohqsg
Ik its vv pathetic im panicking over elect hist,btohqsg
Sign on as sgt in army,btohqsg
True  no wonder all the J2 missing haha,btohqsg
WA LONG TIME NO SEE BIZNOTES!,btohqsg
ok was a nice 10minutes in this group bye lmao,btohqsg
No  I scared bounty hunter track me down and kill me,btohqsg
