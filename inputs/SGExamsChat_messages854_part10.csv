Yea. And love is dry too,btohqsg
Will you still visit the relative who invites you during cny if you are required to pay part of the price they spent to prepare the reunion dinner?,btohqsg
If I am invited then no.If I come in uninvited  yes.,btohqsg
of course if you are invited,btohqsg
If I contributed something  even harder no.,btohqsg
Like bringing more food  bringing the table  etc,btohqsg
tbh depends bc if they invite me and putting in all the effort to cook and stuff,btohqsg
What will yall do if you scored badly for As to not be able to enter local unis and yet no money to go overseas?,btohqsg
Oh honestly I had thought abt it before but not very deeply,btohqsg
I wld have thought of going to sutd engineering product design,btohqsg
I would actually prefering going lasalle or going poly,btohqsg
like all are equally valid. it's just what works for you,btohqsg
Oh yea  well I mean I wld retake,btohqsg
But when I come out and still fail,btohqsg
treat it as a gap year to figure out what i wanna do more too,btohqsg
But if syllabus change ? Rp changing also to 70?,btohqsg
if you have the time and mental energy  yeah i'd suggest to retake,btohqsg
ok my take is honestly that if i fucked up badly enough,btohqsg
in the grand scheme of things a year doesnt make much a difference,btohqsg
Then will u still go to uni,btohqsg
the change in syllabus isn't going to make things much worse to retake,btohqsg
No but that is if you do ok enuf  the qn posed if you do badly,btohqsg
i mean someone that used to be in this chat is in that path now,btohqsg
fucked up a's -> ns -> worked -> poly y2 lol,btohqsg
not me being at least 3 years older than my peers,btohqsg
plans to enter uni even tho he'd be quite old,btohqsg
3 years is an entire poly route lmao,btohqsg
i dont think you should think about the what if you do badly question  but rather evaluate your options now and see which one suits you the best,btohqsg
because either way time is gonna pass,btohqsg
I have seen pple who passed ite and passed poly so well that they dont want to go uni,btohqsg
I have also seen someone who failed ite and had to change course after ns in ite,btohqsg
but that's the super minority and even then i'd still recommend going uni,btohqsg
like for the super super majority i'd advocate uni,btohqsg
why is it always 3 of us no life chatting here btw,btohqsg
because im procrastinating from my HW homework,btohqsg
technically i can finish it in 5 mins but even so im still procrastinating,btohqsg
thats how bad my self discipline is,btohqsg
My parents want me to stay here in sg,btohqsg
And im panicking bc apparently everyone has a backup plan,btohqsg
I mean you arent too late,btohqsg
But yet im not confident of studying everything over by myself,btohqsg
not possible to redo it in school?,btohqsg
you can retake a levels while doing smth else too,btohqsg
I actually have a very stupid qn,btohqsg
Im a girl so theres no ns,btohqsg
if you do h2 physics si yan can be your tutor,btohqsg
i'll tell you a stupid answer,btohqsg
no i mean you can work and stuff or even enter poly while retaking,btohqsg
i dont know how to study,btohqsg
