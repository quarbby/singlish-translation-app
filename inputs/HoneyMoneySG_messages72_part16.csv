for the hsbc revolution card  milleage program - can i cancel the annual payment at any time?,btohqsg
I think you need to engage hsbc to cancel itBefore they charge you towards the end of current program,btohqsg
Need enlightenment... y i maintain slightly over $100k in uob one throughout October month.. bonus interest is slightly over 4%?,btohqsg
i see  otherwise itâ€™s auto deduct every year?,btohqsg
it is based on day over a year calculation  if u get ard 420 in bonus interest it is correct,btohqsg
Towards the end of current program it will deduct.I read somewhere its best to cancel 1 month before it endsElse ya its gonna deduct the annual fees.By then abit more troublesome to cancel and get back the fees.,btohqsg
