Tele hitch is illegal in singapore right ? Dangerous,btohqsg
Huh? Ask you how many times you masturbate is common question?,btohqsg
I want to ask the same qn‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Have bf or not is really none of their biz,btohqsg
Yes it‚Äôs common but it also depends on the topic,btohqsg
Out of nowhere ask you have bf or not is a sign already,btohqsg
next time u must use the element of surprise and ask him if he got gf anot,btohqsg
If i board the car and ask uncle got wife or not  it sound weird right,btohqsg
Yea but i almost get ask most of time if start conversation. If the driver want to start conver and i dont reply i feel rude ...so sometime really dunno what to do.,btohqsg
