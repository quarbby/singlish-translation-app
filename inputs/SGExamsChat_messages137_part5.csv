You can try Jewel  there's a place my friend found and its called Coffee@works. They have a power outlet for you to use and won't chase you away.Another option is the hospital. It's open 24 hours and their coffee bean/Starbucks should be open as well.,btohqsg
But in view of this virus  are they still operating 24 hours?,btohqsg
No  they shut down at night,btohqsg
Nah  I went there at 1 am the day after POP to send my friend off,btohqsg
I work night shifts in a hospital and the coffee bean was open the entire night. Maybe it differs?,btohqsg
Hahahah I was talking about the airport/Jewel Starbucks,btohqsg
Hospitals are a good place to study  but they won't chase away anyone right?,btohqsg
Not sure tbhCan give it a try :D,btohqsg
hello everyone. Have anyone retake o level Chinese and Chinese B together at the same year before and what are the benefits for chinese B as a subject?,btohqsg
I think people generally don’t take both CL and CLB?,btohqsg
CLB’s main benefit is that you don’t have to take CL,btohqsg
I have a friend that did,btohqsg
The benefit of Chinese B is that in case you fail Chinese  your pass in CLB allows you to still go to JC. Assuming you have sufficient graded O level subjects  because CLB is not counted.,btohqsg
But if I want to go poly  can I count chinese B as one of my R4?,btohqsg
What is it and why is it 257.7 mb,btohqsg
