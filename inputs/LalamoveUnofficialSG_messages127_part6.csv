Cannot leh  I also do how to report,btohqsg
So the scammers are the shop owners ? Since we buy it and couldnâ€™t deliver,btohqsg
@parableofsoweris it you use money to buy already they MIA on you?,btohqsg
Well  thatâ€™s a good question. But I doubt so tho.,btohqsg
First you call them itâ€™s our practice right they wonâ€™t answer itâ€™s a local mobile then I text he replied job is confirmThen he will contact you using overseas number itâ€™s the same person as the one who orderHe will first ask you buy items like food etc etcAfter that he will ask you go 7-11 buy stuff this is where the scam comes inHe will give you a QR code and ask you to top up for him once this top up is doneHe wil delete all his conversation with you and when you reach the destination to drop off that address is a fake address,btohqsg
My thought was Iâ€™m working for Lalamove and this is the job I get after I look for them they deny everything,btohqsg
Thank you itâ€™s ok la just honestly Lalamove seriously cmi,btohqsg
Just be careful lor since you guys know how this scam works,btohqsg
No problem we should share for me I just work and work didnâ€™t imagine while working for a platform they actually allow this scam to happen and they Pua bodoh as if itâ€™s our own liability to have kenna scam and when they are the source provider,btohqsg
I really hope something can be done to get back your money. And lalamove should do their jobs in preventing such jobs scams from taking place.,btohqsg
Sorry man bro. But thanks for sharing tho. Always wondered how they execute the scam part.,btohqsg
Lalamove is as good as any other platform. BS. Make use of them like they do you.,btohqsg
LLM should verified every customer with their personal details like address in ID and contact with sms code verification to ensure registration is real person so that anything going wrong can deal with them  this will eliminate fake order,btohqsg
Even if they dont verify  such orders should be via card payment only. That would be safer,btohqsg
omg i just kena from this scam also,btohqsg
when i reached the destination  there is another lala move driver here also,btohqsg
we both kena scammed by the same person,btohqsg
now then i saw this chat ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  did you guys report police?,btohqsg
we called the police and they came down to the address,btohqsg
then i went to google the slide reload thing is actually one way to remit money also,btohqsg
Hopefully they can retrieve the money,btohqsg
Ohhhh myâ€¦â€¦itâ€™s no wonder these scammers keep trying so hard everydayâ€¦â€¦.,btohqsg
1 out of 10 are still vulnerable. And donâ€™t see the whole idea about the requests.,btohqsg
Honestly they should just stop  purchase service,btohqsg
can purchase service but must credit order not cash order,btohqsg
Dont forget the ahlong orders also.just be careful.,btohqsg
Anyone have lalamove cs whatsapp number?,btohqsg
Just be careful of this marcus idiot.,btohqsg
Dont know what the hell are doing also,btohqsg
I don't think they will reply you,btohqsg
How to check that itâ€™s ahlong order?,btohqsg
If let say they give you the sender address  and the receiver address is incomplete then its a ahlong order..,btohqsg
Ohhh  okay. Thank you for the explanation.,btohqsg
My past 3 years doing lalamove  this is the 5th time i encounter this.,btohqsg
LLM cannot continue anymore  never protect driver customers always right  cut driver price  CBD open all drivers die  now carpark expensive some building no grace. In future satellite systems implemented how to survive?,btohqsg
They Dont care lah sure got people take,btohqsg
Their mindset is as long as people take they donâ€™t care,btohqsg
Newbies like me lor. Gong gong take and paid parking ðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
Agreed. Always have new blood come in to this platform. They no worry about it ðŸ˜¿,btohqsg
Mangyaring ipaalam sa akin kung sinuman ang nakakakilala sa driver na ito. Kung hindi niya ako mabigyan ng numero ng telepono para makipag-ugnayan sa kanya  nawala ang order ko nang hindi ito naihatid kagabi.,btohqsg
LLm is for all drivers to see the stingy and abusive side of Singapore users.  It is a one sided platform for1)tekan drivers2)illegal fetching of people without PDVL3)for cultivating abusive nature of humans in singaporeðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I encounter ppl delivering drugs before.  I reported to police. Eventually wasted hrs for statements,btohqsg
A platform even drug users use sia. Knn,btohqsg
bcos users donâ€™t need to register using real identity  hence abused.,btohqsg
Yes all anyhow.  Get 3ppl sit on van with heavy loads travel 25km.  Pay $28 . Simi LJ,btohqsg
LLm has turned sg into pukhet island.  All anyhow.,btohqsg
Quick question  is it normal that you can't cash out fully to the last cent?,btohqsg
Erms no. Like $50.12 you can only cash out $50.10 and not $50.12. Is it norm?,btohqsg
21 cartons $26 only  so cheap,btohqsg
