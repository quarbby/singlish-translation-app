Ngl it does help looks a lot,btohqsg
But my bbk suck keep squeal,btohqsg
But honestly for everyday driving  not needed,btohqsg
And also BBK heavy adds weight,btohqsg
So no bbk? Just paint ah?,btohqsg
U use the race pads ah,btohqsg
Why not buy your brakes from taobao,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs braking power you want start with steel braided lines first. Will help already.,btohqsg
If u really want  get the taiwan ones,btohqsg
Eh we really think alike one,btohqsg
Okay still got what can zhng for cheap heheh,btohqsg
I think i spend too much time in your rickshaw@anwo252,btohqsg
Audi r matt silver mirror cap,btohqsg
I like it to squeal.. but yet it have stopping power,btohqsg
The body kit gonna have all mah,btohqsg
Hahahahahhaah suddenly want to buy rickshaw right,btohqsg
Black mirror cap + Nardo grey car?,btohqsg
Grey but gonna go Nardo grey,btohqsg
Im a big joke when I go meetups,btohqsg
Only my personal opinion AH coz end of the day it‚Äôs your ride your vibe  but I don‚Äôt vote green caliper covers,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt know about car la .. clown one,btohqsg
Eh u shud do RED or BLUE,btohqsg
I thought most grey or black car is green one?,btohqsg
I ALWAYS ASK them for advice de HAHHA,btohqsg
But actually I also feel red like nice leh,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt waste money on bbk now,btohqsg
Those wear skimpy dress sit on car one,btohqsg
I GOT BAD motion sickness so i cant do,btohqsg
Grey and let the red words pop subtly,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs too much money just for aesthetics sir,btohqsg
More CF = more better what,btohqsg
Bodykit yes. Some spray body colour,btohqsg
You buy car for other people meh,btohqsg
Also market price for bbk how much ah,btohqsg
You want pop? Get chrome rims. Black rims just get lost in pictures etc.,btohqsg
I thought it was gonna be like 1.2k,btohqsg
Pops and bangs not illegal leh,btohqsg
Like that I think I do body kit first  more obvious,btohqsg
Yes. Remember don‚Äôt overdo on fake CF.,btohqsg
I will never put any carbon fiber on my car  esp fake one,btohqsg
The one I saw is this la,btohqsg
Like this 608 car I see before,btohqsg
I feel like a lot of Audi people change their body kit to RS one? In my carpark alone I know 4 of them change  1 of them go put fake RS5 badge somemore,btohqsg
Maybe you should be different snd find other bodykit,btohqsg
I want but then (SG) so limited  is either MTM  RS or the ABT,btohqsg
Else I‚Äôll get some wide body kit or something,btohqsg
One hand steering  another hand is lemonade strawberry,btohqsg
Eh eh what time already still all awake?,btohqsg
Alcantara Bonnet!!!!! Have or not ah? Alcantara like so nice like that,btohqsg
Only thing that is stopping one from having it is money!! But I‚Äôm sure the rich kor kors here can easily afford it!!!,btohqsg
Yeah!!!!!! I see everyone so rich can buy this buy that. One day when I grow up I also want to be like you and them!,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not rich yet but I‚Äôm working towards it or should I say ‚Äúslaving‚Äù towards it,btohqsg
so much to learn from you. Your garage is already so awesome and yet so humble.,btohqsg
Haiyah there will always be those seeking attention by making stirring  unconventional statements or comments. Why bother üòä,btohqsg
Some focus on aesthetics. Some focus on performance. Some don‚Äôt mod their cars at all because they know next buyers won‚Äôt even care for the mods and they will likely not be able to get extra money for them. In fact when most people see modded cars they often think ‚Äúuh oh abused car + hello high wear and tear issues‚Äù,btohqsg
I have no money but I like to go car meets coz I love to see people‚Äôs builds!! Many of them so nice. Like the ones they have in Japan and US. Super cool!,btohqsg
My forester mirror is silver one,btohqsg
wah sounds good siahow much it cost?üòÖ,btohqsg
Pm me if u want i give u workshop name,btohqsg
U just change air intake bro,btohqsg
bro what car u driving ah?just curious üòÖ,btohqsg
Sounds like a bad deal. If i buy sgcm warranty need to ownself pay anot ah?,btohqsg
Yah to bad deal or sgcm warranty,btohqsg
If you want warranty go buy from car times ah,btohqsg
nowadays consignment car i abit sus. most of the dealers that approached me offer 1 year or 6 months warranty to their customer.,btohqsg
Wait! You‚Äôre in Malaysia!! hahaha unless they have in Singapore already,btohqsg
Have free xp cashcard mah hahaha,btohqsg
Today biz quiet. No one take rickshaw,btohqsg
Want to make your rickshaw üõ∫ faster not,btohqsg
I only put underglow and upgrade underseat subwoofer so that customers feel more boomz when we EDM down Clark quay at night,btohqsg
TSCH TSSCCHH DU DU DUU DUUU,btohqsg
I saw a sweet forester last night before sleeping,btohqsg
Love looking at foresters with solid fitment on deep dish in particular hahahaah,btohqsg
Person A ask a dealer to help them sell and handle paperwork,btohqsg
dealer earns money thru comm insurance and admin fee,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a bit like buying from owner with a dealer face in front,btohqsg
but the downside is that its considered a C2C transaction  lemon law does not apply,btohqsg
Consumer to Consumer  correct me if i'm wrong,btohqsg
I prefer something that protected by lemon law . Some more not cheap,btohqsg
Best if you can find direct owner,btohqsg
Some buyers feel more comfortable seeing a dealer in front rather than an individual,btohqsg
the upside for the car owner is there is no dealer markdown when u sell.,btohqsg
honestly  if u consign  u will tell the dealer some leeway when negotiating the price,btohqsg
but hor i heard some dealers snake,btohqsg
they sell ur car at a higher price,btohqsg
eg u ask them sell 65k,btohqsg
Should still apply if the seller represents the car to be able to do a certain thing for a certain selling price.,btohqsg
cus its still a Consumer - Consumer txn cus its transferred from C2C not B2C,btohqsg
FI-R .. I see the price also faint,btohqsg
FI-R wahhhh. Eh my rickshaw already very light. No need further weight savings wahahahhaahhaha,btohqsg
So u saying the rickshaw puller fat ah ü§£,btohqsg
Just anyhow whack one . He ok,btohqsg
Don't care too much for dealer warranty  especially on golfs. Many won't actually follow it,btohqsg
No money sir. Can use can already haha,btohqsg
Ok ‚Ä¶ tonite I go use hammer whack ü§£,btohqsg
My dealer is settling the car today  agreeable to cover for replacement of turbo etc.,btohqsg
Also I submitted a CASE case towards them,btohqsg
Later come back 1 x used serviceable turbo,btohqsg
Runzzz to where.. later u fall,btohqsg
my job is all about running leh‚Ä¶ steady one hahahahahah,btohqsg
Next time we can run together,btohqsg
Singapore government encourage healthy lifestyle anyway!!!,btohqsg
lai can PM me ur dealer?,btohqsg
No la.. I pull ur rickshaw mah,btohqsg
This is likely outcome I‚Äôm guessing,btohqsg
Lemon law accounts for age and condition of car at sale so I‚Äôm guessing obligation won‚Äôt be to replace with new.,btohqsg
Sit inside my car? Become trailer üòÇ,btohqsg
Can we jio more members sit in your car then we go eat Nasi Padang together?,btohqsg
Hahaha. Let me finish the fixing first,btohqsg
This seller‚Äôs food very good one. Non oily. Won‚Äôt pui pui one afterwards,btohqsg
If he become stuntman I‚Äôll shoot his dealership out,btohqsg
I think you mean another person here ü§≠,btohqsg
Not here la‚Ä¶ another grp üòÇ,btohqsg
Of course. Wah lucky you clarified otherwise some people may sensitive,btohqsg
Like one of my body part,btohqsg
Sole of my foot I mean!!!,btohqsg
I experienced when go foot reflexology,btohqsg
I kicked a foot masseuse once  not doing it ever again,btohqsg
Maybe they replace you with a used turbo with warranty of 6 months . Then after that you broken down again .,btohqsg
Similar specifications then can rewire in,btohqsg
You nv know . Can resolve can already   later spoilt is another issue,btohqsg
And send me serial number of ori turbo,btohqsg
