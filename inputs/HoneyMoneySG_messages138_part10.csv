Try checking merchant mcc on heymax,btohqsg
Digital bank like mari  gxs with simple saving interest rate as a starter,btohqsg
PSA: Remember to transfer $100k into Esaver by today if you are participating in 3.50% p.a. Marathon Esaver Promotion.Hint Hint... bank accounts savings rate might be dropping real soon.,btohqsg

Hi which would be the best cc for air miles currently,btohqsg
Best miles card depends on your individual spending. Some may find Citi prestige best miles card while other may find UOB Lady or Citi Rewards best mile card.,btohqsg
Best is subjective. What is ur spend habit?,btohqsg
To look for best mile card that suit you  you can search chat history using keywords.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/122307,btohqsg
For UOB Credit Card $350 sign up bonus  There is an explanation why so many people did not qualify due to vague terms and lack of clarity. I guess only UOB does things like that.Basically if a promotional period states 1 October to 30 November  (2 months period) you have to sign up for the card within the first few days of October and make the $1000 charge within the first few days of October too to qualify as First 200 (Logically speaking) even if you make the charge on 5th October it would be a stretch already and you may not even be the first 200 seeing how popular this promotion is.,btohqsg
"There is also a reason why they give you dates like 10th as an example  Because you definitely won't be the first 200 on day 10  Some people charge on day 6 also not the first 200 participants. Basically giving you a false sense of ""hope""",btohqsg
so TLDR: don't do UOB sign up bonus? (too much grief liao)and i still must nag... UOB is the one of DA BESTEST bank now liao for BOTH savings as well as credit cards.How can be new to bank for savings or credit cards??,btohqsg
You can sign up if you truly understand and read the terms  Don't get played by them. Make sure you are getting it if you understand their terms  you will definitely get it.,btohqsg
i did have one 'medium' experience with UOB SUB before.i added a Supp card holder who was BRAND NEW to Bank.. (unbelievable!).We managed to get the $60 of Grab vouchers by being first XXX supp card holder to sign up in the month and spend i think $200 per month for 3 consecutive months.actually i guess the 3 consecutive months spend knocked out a lot of competition so we got it.Experience was 'medium' instead of good because nobody in UOB could confirm we qualified until one day we got the SMS with the 3 x $20 grab codes.,btohqsg
TLDR register on 1st day of promo and clock spend on virtual card on the day of approval (which is usually on the same day),btohqsg
Youâ€™d have to leave this in till end December for the 3.5?,btohqsg
Do u happen to know whatâ€™s their definition of first 200 per month? Is it first 200 to hit the qualifying spend that month  and does the date of card application and approval matter?,btohqsg
Yes date matters  read my initial post and the live chat with agent,btohqsg
Asking because Iâ€™m intending to sign up soon  but idk if I should apply for it on nov1 or have gotten it approved on nov1 to be able to qualify,btohqsg
First 200 approved and also first 200 hitting the qualifying spend.,btohqsg
Don't sign up now you can't make the mark. Wait until next promotional event already,btohqsg
no needas long as day end balance on 31st october (HOLIDAY!!) is $100 000 above 30th sep day end balance  you qualify already.https://www.sc.com/sg/save/savings-accounts/esaver/HINT HINT... better just get this activated.... you never know when you will need it.,btohqsg
its better to go for guaranteed sign up bonus like uob prvi annual fee paying option.,btohqsg
Ah just read your chat  I suspected that the qualifying spend period of 2 months must fall within Nov as well,btohqsg
Their gift of airpods pro is also rather trash right now after you minus away card annual fee you are only getting $200-250,btohqsg
If Sep mab is then cannot/does not make sense to participate  correct?,btohqsg
yes.. you need LOW september MAB to maximise the bonus interestyou need $100k above end sep day end balance to qualifybut nobody should have high MAB for esaver in september anyway.. it was paying below marketbut i highly suspect scb esaver marathon is going to be king in November and December 2024,btohqsg
Is the comparison against September for all 3 months? I read the tnc and couldnâ€™t pick that up.,btohqsg
good news is there is no invitation needed... just find another esaver account that has low ADB.. u have today to settle,btohqsg
Or setup 1...but might not be in time,btohqsg
Anyone participated in the trust deposit promo of 3.5%? For salary credit  bonus  must this be done via employer or thereâ€™s a workaround? Iâ€™m self employed,btohqsg
So even if I leave it in itâ€™s good enough for getting the bonus all the 3 months  right? HSBC is a bit of a hassle moving in and out.,btohqsg
you will get bonus interest as per TNC pasted above. No need move around until 31st December.,btohqsg
need to transfer in by 30 Oct cos 31 Oct transaction will be dated 1 Nov.,btohqsg
yes ah today 9am i do liao.. scared kenna jammed by new framework,btohqsg
ADD ON NAG... especially with the launch of new framework ($25k or more than half of account transfer out) triggering something  i rather just dump into somewhere for 3 months no need touch.,btohqsg
Do you guys leave in the minimum balance in ega? Are they strict about the fall below?,btohqsg
Yes. I kenna minus 5 before haha. I never tried zero out though,btohqsg
Hi  all for the HSBC EGA 1% cash back for GIRO spending  does the sequence matters ? I did 5 eligible transactions > GIRO Deduction > Deposit 5K.  Have yet to receive my cash back.,btohqsg
