yeah but dependent on their ways of spending,btohqsg
bro  you still havent answered. what do you think a car like the eletre  being a made in china 2680kg EV with poor efficiency  what is a fair price for it in SG?,btohqsg
is there gonna be a car meet anytime soon?,btohqsg
I assess a car holistically base on its driving characteristic  reliability etc…,btohqsg
i'm going somewhere with this though..what do you personally think a car like that is worth?,btohqsg
you see you are dodging the question and i absolutely know why,btohqsg
there is no fair price  willing buyer willing seller.,btohqsg
anyone else want to give their opinion? what a car like that should be worth?,btohqsg
i would put the lotus in the price point similar of a SUV Lexus,btohqsg
there are basically no willing buyers in singapore aside from maybe that one nutcase,btohqsg
IMO a little overvalued but ok. what does an SUV lexus RX cost?,btohqsg
then no buyers lor  but its still a nice car to drive haha,btohqsg
u mean a new rolls royce is a shit car because its expensive?,btohqsg
not at all. but you pay RR money cos you know why it costs so much,btohqsg
bro. how much is a lexus RX?,btohqsg
if u gave me materials  craftmanship and engineering that is well worth the price AND status on top,btohqsg
300K maybe at the most right?,btohqsg
that is why 1mil RR is still a good car,btohqsg
would you choose a 964 or a rx,btohqsg
“most car enthusiast will choose a 964”,btohqsg
which RX did you use sia? the bloody top spec one?,btohqsg
RX is a mid tier SUV,btohqsg
doesn’t neccesarily mean a car enthu will take a 964 over a RX,btohqsg
some will choose the RX because of warranty  easier parts and it’s a SUV,btohqsg
so this is about equal to an eletre in your book?,btohqsg
guess how much the eletre costs,btohqsg
i thought it wld be 400-500k,btohqsg
for that chinese made piece of shit,btohqsg
so now tell me again how its a decent car,btohqsg
so u pay 200k more without coe?,btohqsg
explain to me like i'm 5,btohqsg
nah tbh he has a point la,btohqsg
now i can add overpriced to overweight  made in china  ugly and poor efficiency,btohqsg
ur point is it’s a good car to drive,btohqsg
but keep going telling me how its a decent car,btohqsg
i never said the Eletre is an overpriced car haha,btohqsg
his point is that it’s not and not worth it,btohqsg
but it is a very nice car to drive haha,btohqsg
“wtf is a eletre and why is it kind of shitty?”,btohqsg
meaningless statement esp without context from a guy who doesnt even own cars,btohqsg
i nvr said either of u werent talking abt that,btohqsg
i bet i would find it shit,btohqsg
it’s js that he made a good point,btohqsg
does it make my opinion more valuable than yours or less?,btohqsg
hahahaha aiyo… asked you if you drive before and now you start to gaslight hahahha,btohqsg
to be clear. the ENTRY LEVEL eletre (there is a more premium one) WITHOUT COE is 598k,btohqsg
actually maybe because ive driven it before?,btohqsg
he’s not rly gas lighting tho,btohqsg
hahaha why you keep focusing on the price?,btohqsg
anyway i've made my point  the car is dogshit on any metric and you are the only champion who feels differently  aside from the one dude who bought it,btohqsg
