guys how do u get a guy who obviously like you to stop texting you  ive set my boundaries very clearly and told him to stop  but he literally and i mean he literally texts me every waking hour  i dont want to make an enemy,btohqsg
or ignore because theres no way to not make an enemy out of him,btohqsg
Maybe when u set ur boundaries  he didn't know u were being serious so he continued on. But u can warn him again and tell him the to stop messaging u  and if he do it again  just block,btohqsg
he keeping using me as like a girlfriend therapist  he is obviously very lonely  ive literally told him im very busy and i feel burned out from him already  but he continues,btohqsg
and he is very nice so it's hard to reject,btohqsg
"Reply him only at night and say  ""sorry  busy day  got to go sleep""",btohqsg
He doesn't have ur phone number right?,btohqsg
he literally tells me that he notices that i am only awake from a certain time to a certain time  and that i seem to be sleeping a lot and he wonders how he can help me with it cuz it seems like im unwell,btohqsg
basically makes it so that he is really nice and im forced to talk to him,btohqsg
Yea  I guess he wants to make u feel guilty if u don't talk to him,btohqsg
Than just don't reply him and arhive his chat,btohqsg
Don't reply for a few days  he will find someone new eventually,btohqsg
If the harassment continue   just block and reportüëç,btohqsg
This is some next level stalker shit,btohqsg
Maybe u can start by hiding ur profile picture from him haha,btohqsg
Obsessing till you know their sleeping habits isn't,btohqsg
That sounds like some serial murderer shit,btohqsg
U both have the same pic but different mouth HAHAHA,btohqsg
The continual stoppage of the living state of various homo sapiens,btohqsg
I knew it was the same pic,btohqsg
But I didn't see the mouth,btohqsg

The microwave one is using transport voucher from FAS,btohqsg
Transport vouchers not directly into EZ Link meh,btohqsg

Here in Singapore it‚Äôs 9:33 AM lmao,btohqsg
yall know any deaf community in sg?,btohqsg
damn... singapore really do be no 1..,btohqsg
no other country will bother enough w/ school to have an entire community revolved around exams,btohqsg
i started learning asl during cb lol,btohqsg
if i happened to see a deaf hot chick in a bar,btohqsg
nice to meet you all üôÇ,btohqsg
nothing else can better explain the pain of climbing 7 floors daily,btohqsg
i mean asl is also like a language so im just learning a new language during cb to upgrade myself,btohqsg
now i know how to say why are u gay,btohqsg
mainly a group for degenerates to share their experiences,btohqsg
what a succinct and accurate description...,btohqsg
like 'having lost the physical  mental  or moral qualities considered normal and desirable; showing evidence of decline.',btohqsg
Real talk: this group is for students to talk about anything under the sun,btohqsg
can you give me an example?,btohqsg
you can share ur school experiences in canada,btohqsg
Once I came back to Canada 6 years ago again  I couldn't speak or write English only speak basics and write basics words  but then I also came from South Korea too. When I came back to my old school 6 years ago  I didn't even know people there  but some people recongnized me when I was in kinderguarten.,btohqsg
even though I wasn't good at English  but I was VERY good at math back then,btohqsg
same except the very good at math part,btohqsg
are there gun laws in canada,btohqsg
I don't know what kind of gun law you are talking about okay?,btohqsg
Now  I am good at English  Math  Computer Programming  Computer Technology,btohqsg
I am from South Korea + Canada,btohqsg
yes  my future career is to become a computer programmer,btohqsg
Can I ask How old you guys are?,btohqsg

Turn 18 a few weeks ago,btohqsg
I am 16 too  but i'm 18 in South Korea,btohqsg
i tot u gonna enter uni alr wtf,btohqsg
going to be 17 soon in July,btohqsg
@idefinitelydidnotseeI thought ur gonna go Uni too,btohqsg
You can be different age in different countries?,btohqsg
because of our beloved national service,btohqsg
korea has a different age system,btohqsg
I think they count based on the time you become a zygote,btohqsg
is a bit like china  when ure newborn ur age is 1 instead of 0,btohqsg
so it's like 10 months earlier HAHA,btohqsg
How do u even tell  minus 9months?,btohqsg
that's why it's a little flawed,btohqsg
Or when the baby come out,btohqsg
Genetically edit sperms to display a date of fertilisation,btohqsg
ah yes my favourite part where every convo can turn into a math related question,btohqsg
U know those people with birthday like1/1/2001And31/12/2000,btohqsg
so about the gun thingy  I am I am 16 years old female who study hard to achieve her dream so I don't know anything about gun thingy  because if I have a gun I would be arrested,btohqsg
Difference by one day but one will be studying one year earlier,btohqsg
I only play with water gun befire,btohqsg
Guns handled safely are quite a good experience,btohqsg
i have a friend who was born on 1/1,btohqsg
Next time you get to play with rifle,btohqsg
she was given a choice to study with my batch or the batch after me,btohqsg
cuz the report book usually says age at 2/1/year,btohqsg
Well  if you don‚Äôt handle it around psychos  it‚Äôs quite ok,btohqsg
Yeah  but legally it's the standard system of 0.00 at birth,btohqsg
yeah in china we use the standard system too,btohqsg
only boomers count the other way,btohqsg
it makes me sound older oso so i dont like it üôÉ,btohqsg
16 years 9 months 20 days2 hours and 59 minutes,btohqsg
But suddenly when u turn 18,btohqsg
16 years 9 months 20 days2 hours and 59 minutes old,btohqsg
nah im 18 and i feel im still young,btohqsg
so your birthday's on the 18th of August?,btohqsg

Depends on what kind of legal,btohqsg

Eh what are they gonna do anyway?,btohqsg
when she was studying you guys were texting alot. I know it because we were facetiming and her phone was blowing up hahahaha,btohqsg
the n word's not allowed here as well..,btohqsg
What sites did you go to? ;),btohqsg
Cause most big groups are super active,btohqsg
im actl surprised n word isnt allowed lol,btohqsg
it's not allowed in discord either,btohqsg
sg is not that sensitive towards it in my  impressions,btohqsg
Ehhhh.... even if it's not active  just 1% of us talking is quite alot,btohqsg
what are you guys doing now?,btohqsg
waiting for the deaf hot chick to appear in my life,btohqsg
sg typically use a mix of asl and csl,btohqsg
are you guys from all the same country?,btohqsg
do you guys know each other?,btohqsg
This group was meant for Singaporeans,btohqsg
nice so its singlish but do it in hands,btohqsg
But of course anyone is welcome if they are nice people,btohqsg
sg has its own version of everything,btohqsg
I am driving a car with an adult or person who has full G2 for 2 or more years,btohqsg
there are so many examples idk what to begin with lol,btohqsg
like all the food and language and cultures from other countries,btohqsg
I get to be able to drive on my own this year when I get my G2 in December,btohqsg
We have our own version of Cambridge exams,btohqsg
sg just grab them and add things to make it 'sg',btohqsg

sgeducators never fails to amase me tbh,btohqsg
Everyone's welcome so as long as they don't make trouble,btohqsg
Hey but the admins r good. We r all good,btohqsg
Especially when sgexams is a banned word in sgeducators,btohqsg
Dammit I can't see dark mode stickers,btohqsg
Who exactly r the admins in this chat? Oracle?,btohqsg
I believe there's this weird tag beside their names,btohqsg
But I have no idea who are the admins as well,btohqsg
They are a mysterious group of people,btohqsg
Legends say those with admin status have tags beside their names,btohqsg
well at least I'm not in a grp with duplicate admins ^_^,btohqsg
Nah is okay  hahaThe admins there r good too. They r my friends,btohqsg
Yes i hear u but first,btohqsg
It's been so long since I felt such positive vibes,btohqsg
It's not that they are bad,btohqsg
I have not i hv not clarified  r the admins here in anyway related to EL?,btohqsg
is just that the ways they do certain stuff are a bit ‚Ä¶..hmm questionable,btohqsg
Is there something we should be concerned about EL,btohqsg
If there is ever a chance lets come out n have a drink with each other in person! üòÜ,btohqsg
Cos i dun really know whom i am talking to on TG to be honest hahaha,btohqsg
Most of us are below legal age,btohqsg
Hahaha ok then dun drink go cafe then,btohqsg
I mean lets gather after covid for constructive session whether is it to catch up in study/exam strategies or to catch up after your national exams,btohqsg
That's assuming Covid will be over haha,btohqsg
i doubt large gatherings will be allowed anytime soon,btohqsg
i'm sitting for psle this year,btohqsg
Do you think by the time I wake up tomorrow morning  there will be 1000 messages? üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

chilledcow for some bomb ass lo-fi hip hop,btohqsg
So where did u go in the end?,btohqsg
Ah yes. Ppl from single sex schools tend to be ‚Äúprouder‚Äù   if not  will be the outcast. Hit or miss is the right word üòÇüëç,btohqsg
Okay. Hmm. Good sch too. But acs better hahaha,btohqsg

Same  I go my coffeeshop downstairs,btohqsg

Than bring bring home make hot üòäüòä,btohqsg

nvr have i felt so pop :'),btohqsg
yeah except its all guys -.-,btohqsg
i think my mom is right worrying about me being gay in all guys environment,btohqsg
yea u probably wouldnt be able to think straight,btohqsg
ah  a man of culture i see,btohqsg
Hahah oops why r we getting into it,btohqsg
Well is just a gathering of large group of ppl without much managing,btohqsg
Mainly is cos their admin is a young n aloof guy,btohqsg
So i would use the word ‚Äúuntidy‚Äù?,btohqsg
Hahaa but is just one girl i think? Cos most of these groups r joined by students too,btohqsg
Yup this is the main problem,btohqsg
Otherwise i would have sold my materials on the open market alr,btohqsg
These r some of the problems,btohqsg
Is hard to audit n follow thru,btohqsg
Yes u should. Omg thanks for telling,btohqsg
I would learn how to  too,btohqsg
I havent dared to sell any of my materials cos of the issues u mentioned,btohqsg
And this  we cant verify the person we sell to,btohqsg
So it is only viewable to the one person,btohqsg
set up an authentication endpoint which returns an OTP whenever people want to open your notes,btohqsg
tbh there's no such thing as unable to download,btohqsg
the fact that you're viewing it means you've downloaded it,btohqsg
they can only make it harder for you that's all,btohqsg
true that  but since you're using a very well known platform to do it  more tech savvy users could probably find a solution that's a google's search away,btohqsg
Ok lah is true that ppl can screenshot,btohqsg
but if it has worked so far then why not,btohqsg
They have to reproduce the content themselves well it takes many hours,btohqsg
may i be made honorary admin@cauchycriterion,btohqsg
what happened to good old cronyism!!!!!,btohqsg
Ya sia shag u know !!,btohqsg
Like going round n round a topic without progress of perspective ü§£ so funny,btohqsg
Yes a few ppl in this channel r inside EL. I don hv the link sorry,btohqsg
No admin set it to private. Admin has been so invaded liao that he closed up the group,btohqsg
Oh ya. I mean parents want the best for their kids too much that they forgot there r 60-80% of the questions that their kids can do üòÇ,btohqsg
But idk who is koo lol,btohqsg

SARS is not as infectious and not as global as covid,btohqsg
SARS was just an Asian thing,btohqsg
Yea nobody cares about Asian virus that infect Asia,btohqsg
Only care when the whole world affected,btohqsg
"""Asian virus!!! Chinese virus!!!"" - Donald Trump",btohqsg
It's a wake up call bah,btohqsg
Nobody gave a shit in 2003 about Asia,btohqsg
Alot more worse thing can happrn,btohqsg

Ah I thought we are all going back on 26th,btohqsg
We are going back 26th  and finishing exam 26th,btohqsg
