Chemistry I think because want less stress hor,btohqsg
Chemistry the section B one must have organic chem,btohqsg
In math also same thing abit for section B,btohqsg
One of the section B question is about Circle angle,btohqsg
But because CLT   they modify it to a simple angle question idk,btohqsg
circle properties is hard but at the same time if uk how to do,btohqsg
If you don’t know how to see,btohqsg
It takes a while to adapt to circles,btohqsg
my cher used like the cut out circles,btohqsg
Do you all use tap or clip burettes,btohqsg
he wants us to cut out 3 circles,btohqsg
then he used the circle to show the chord thing,btohqsg
i only know i use a burette lol,btohqsg
he did that for us to visualise ma,btohqsg
The tap/clip is what stops the solution in the burette from flowing out,btohqsg
I only know burette which is used to serve beer,btohqsg
then how u do chem pract,btohqsg
For the tap  u just loose the tap then the stuff will come out  but for clip you must press the clip,btohqsg
Does it really cost that much to switch to tap,btohqsg
i think the hardest chp in chem,btohqsg
My jc had tap burettes but the teachers said that we had to use the clip burettes cos our juniors were using the tap burettes,btohqsg
Shouldn’t the seniors get the better stuff pepeconcerned,btohqsg
Organic isn’t easy but it’s the most fun,btohqsg
i rlly like the eye tbh,btohqsg
memo & learn how to do diff q lor,btohqsg
pract papers r the key to everything for sciences,btohqsg

Does anyone have the Physics N Level paper 2 answers? pls send thanks !!!,btohqsg

anyone have physics papers to trade?,btohqsg
can send the link? I cant find,btohqsg
Praise the lad Malthusian Trap#0055 for sending so many papers.,btohqsg
how do i add new papers into the drive?,btohqsg
Hi is there Any tips for O’s geography?,btohqsg
and learn how to answer different questions,btohqsg
e.g. trend   compare   desc & explain qns,btohqsg
If so  what the heck is that,btohqsg
iirc its when an element gets reduced and oxidised in the same reaction,btohqsg
its q stupid but u nvr know,btohqsg
does anyone have tips for o's pure chem qa?,btohqsg
Not in syllabus but they will describe what it is,btohqsg
yeah basically with enough info they can test anything :/,btohqsg
For colour of ppt in cation tests:Draw a tree and 4 clouds.Write “Fe3+” on the tree trunk because it’s reddish-brownWrite “Fe2+” on the canopy of leaves because they are greenWrite “Al3+”  “Pb2+”  “Zn2+” and “Ca2+” in the 4 clouds because they are whiteWrite “Cu2+” on the sky because it’s blue😊,btohqsg
i guess... just record all the observations for all the steps u take.like write down the colour of precipitate formed if any? whether is it soluble (if they ask u to add in excess or add until there is no further change) colour of solution (colourless or blue  etc. if its a solution)? any effervescence formed? etc.can follow the qa notes given :),btohqsg
Oh ya and repeat more than 3 times if possible. In prelims  I did it 3 times and 2 of my answers were v close compared to the other one so I chose the 2 and took their average. Later did I realise that the correct answer was my first answer that I did not choose.,btohqsg
dont think there is enough time to do more than 3  usually 3 should be sufficient :),btohqsg
Depends on how u define best,btohqsg
Ima assume thats clerk but i assume pes a/b cant get that,btohqsg
does anyone have tips for chem planning?,btohqsg
