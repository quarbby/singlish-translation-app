then what's the purpose of taking H3 subjects in JC,btohqsg
If you take uni h3 subjects u can be exempted from the mod,btohqsg
Or for some science mod you can take advanced placement test and if you do well enough then can be exempted,btohqsg
but even so  is it possible to shorten uni life?,btohqsg
Ya if u are exempted from some mods+ you overload every sem,btohqsg
U can graduate 1-2 sems earlier,btohqsg
which is half a year to a year right?,btohqsg
I also can't go UK lmao,btohqsg
but isn't like graduating with a Singapore degree easier to find a job?,btohqsg
It depends on which UK uni I suppose,btohqsg
And which SG uni as well,btohqsg
go nbs or take non honours degree or go private uni,btohqsg
like I just want a degree,btohqsg
no need masters and doctor or whatsoever,btohqsg
Honours is basically the default degree,btohqsg
3y for non honours  +1y to get an (Hon) beside your degree name,btohqsg
ohhh so now the norm is having honours?,btohqsg
so the fastest is 3 years if you chiong?,btohqsg
i don't think anyone here has theory crafted on how fast you can speed run a degree,btohqsg
there's a lot of variables involved,btohqsg
u can always graduate without honours,btohqsg
there are ppl who do that,btohqsg
like  will my modules' timetables clash?can I take exemption to do 1 module and another module which requires that one as a prereq together?,btohqsg
Meaning most people choose to take honours,btohqsg
not every1 can declare honours at the start,btohqsg
i'm not even sure if my course allows me to graduate without hons,btohqsg
u earn it once u hit the minimum cap,btohqsg
or does every1 from engineering have inflated CAPs,btohqsg
i swear their profs give out too many As,btohqsg
we need to conduct a randomised double blind trial,btohqsg
i barely know of any1 who got an A- and above for it last sem,btohqsg
ideally I want to go NTU,btohqsg
basically bizad and accounting in ntu,btohqsg
sorry ah Im just someone collecting results tmr HAHA,btohqsg
ohh but I don't have interest in accounting,btohqsg
fastest route is poly (3 years)  then 1.5 years top up degree,btohqsg
I mean if u don't need to use cpf to pay for degree  most private degrees are similarly priced to local ones,btohqsg
plus local u is 4 years  that's a lot of opportunity cost,btohqsg
but isn't like local uni more recognised?,btohqsg
depends on where u want to work and what industry,btohqsg
if u wanna work in Govt jobs they only recognise Local U,btohqsg
but if ure venturing into private sect  not so much emphasis on degree  but rather work exp,btohqsg
im intending to get one book for my dad but i cant decide,btohqsg
By any chance ur from computer engineering in soc ? I wanna ask some qns abt it,btohqsg
nope sry comp engineering is eee i think,btohqsg
Oh ye I know some qns alr HAHA,btohqsg
I tot it was soc sia,btohqsg
Computer eng has modules from EE and CS,btohqsg
1. If I got a certain certificate for some module can I actually exempt from that mod?,btohqsg
That's why I confused whether isit in seg or soc,btohqsg
