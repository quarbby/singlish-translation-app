Hi  would like to check if there is any groupchat for tampines greenvines?,btohqsg
I have booked a 3-room bto at Canberra Vista. Can someone advise whether there are windows in the utility area part of the OCS?,btohqsg
I visited the MyNiceHome gallery and I noted that the 4-room and 5-room did have windows at the Utility area. Please advise whether it is also part of the OCS or can windows and grilles be installed there. I heard that it is not possible until after MOP. I am asking on behalf of those who have booked their bto units at Canberra Vista,btohqsg
If u want a super confirm answer call up hdb to check  with them,btohqsg
Thank you. Try getting someone from hdb on the phone is a real pain but I will try. Thought someone may know,btohqsg
If u visit those new hdb default  all no windows and grilles,btohqsg
Generally the outer windows are not provided by HDB  it is only the louvre windows which is the divider between the kitchen and yard which is provided by HDB.My BTO which is about to TOP is that case,btohqsg
Thank you for the info but for the 3-room it is totally open concept and there is no divider (wall) separating the kitchen and utility area,btohqsg
I had a look at your estate 3RM Floorplan  indeed it is unlike the usual... Good news! seems like it is included as part of the default offering by HDB,btohqsg
if you want to be doubly sure - just email the Customer support who is tagged to your estate  you can find out the person under your myHDB page. they will reply within 14 working daysSave your time by trying to get through to their hotline,btohqsg
Thank you for the info however not being a very techy person how do you even go to MyHDB page. Could not even find it.,btohqsg
