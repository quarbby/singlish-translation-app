vectors is the most hardest topic,btohqsg
You still gotta do it anyway,btohqsg
vectors was among easiest for me,btohqsg
But once you manage it youll be fine,btohqsg
No point mulling its hard yknow,btohqsg
hard part is 3D visualisation  that itself is hard for many,btohqsg
Oh you dont need to visualise,btohqsg
do u have any tips on how to visualise?,btohqsg
as what Wyatt mentioned  one way is draw out,btohqsg
Drawing is visualisation without using your imagination and going to the 4th dimension,btohqsg
difference is  if you graduate MI with A lvl cert but cannot qualify uni  A lvl cert is quite useless compared to poly cert,btohqsg
how many dimensions are in alvl vectors,btohqsg
The 4th one is time.But that's physics.,btohqsg
Draw 3d shapes using 2d paper,btohqsg
what's your O lvl score again?,btohqsg
And many MI students end up like that,btohqsg
If A Maths no min B3  then don't take H2 Math,btohqsg
in fact B3 will still struggle for H2 Math,btohqsg
If only someone told me this,btohqsg
But then i didnt even get F9,btohqsg
Feel like B3 is still possible.,btohqsg
Eng b3 rest A2  amth emath a1,btohqsg
But C5 is a hell no,btohqsg
Its my only choice  only step up for me really was nyjc but was far out,btohqsg
possible. cuz for some students is dunno what happened dropped to B3. Normal standards higher.So I cut off at B3,btohqsg
It is possible to do that in yi uh,btohqsg
possible. I have had students who did that. Have to work super hard,btohqsg
The jump from emath to h2 math is pretty far,btohqsg
Tho sometimes wasnt my hand but my brain lol so rly saved me,btohqsg
You need to actually know the CAST thing to under complex numbers quite well,btohqsg
im glad my school forced everyone to take amath,btohqsg
what's that ah? I never used it,btohqsg
Complex numbers was natural for me,btohqsg
But like you know the 4 quadrants thing,btohqsg
Using this score am i able to get into a course with 25 cut-off point using DAE? Anyone can share any past experience or knowledge?,btohqsg
ah last time my time was ASTC,btohqsg
For us  we use cast cus easiest to remember,btohqsg
Plus feel like h2 fm is becoming more suited for uni stuff,btohqsg
Now with conic and math induction gone,btohqsg
H2 math dont have vector calc,btohqsg
Ok tbh is more of multivariable calc than vector calc,btohqsg
Oh but tbh h2 math has stats and probability,btohqsg
That one may or may not wreck your brains a bit but is also onenof the easier ones,btohqsg
ok I need to do some work. Anyone needs any discussions / suggestions on what is possible  feel free to dm me anytime.Those who do well can also consider prepping your CCA portfolio in JC for potential scholarships application (something that I didn't do when I was in JC cuz I didn't know about it),btohqsg
Until they left an onion in the lecture theatre,btohqsg
got for it.Generally people take PCME because it opens more doors.My own combi was replace C with FM but that's like 24 years ago,btohqsg
Honestly h2 chem was a headache,btohqsg
From experience  poly engineering student study similar stats as h1 Math,btohqsg
J1 H2 Physics new syllabus for those going JC. Do take note,btohqsg
I think is similar to h2 math,btohqsg
