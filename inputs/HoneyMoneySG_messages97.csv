if i remember correctly it will only affect your cashback / miles earned and should not affect your interest tracker.They will clawback the miles / cashback earned for those refundedClawback meaning you would need to spend 700$ again to continue earning the miles / cashback,btohqsg
This i what im seeing now in the interest tracker though. It was previously showing $300 expense before the $700 refund,btohqsg
"the interest tracker resets monthly so i would assume it will be ""reset"" and your 700$ refund should not be affecting your next month interest tacker for april",btohqsg
If the UOB One account interest is your main concern  better quickly chat with CSO to clarify. Month end is coming soon.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know how much the the currency difference from using Trust card vs ichange card for KRW?,btohqsg
trust card using visa exchange rate usually about 0.3%https://www.visa.com.sg/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.htmlIchange should be able to view in app,btohqsg
Do you mean the difference is around 0.3%?,btohqsg
for trust card the difference is usually 0.3% from spot rate,btohqsg
I know not related. just sharing for those who are interested mah,btohqsg
Unfortunately unrelated discussions will be deleted,btohqsg
is just a once a year thing for the interest and registration,btohqsg
you have already used 3 messages..you should have just upfront share what you think is interesting..if not relevant it would be deleted  if relevant it lives..,btohqsg
Next month should reset. Suggest you check with CSO.This month if you want to clock you must clock 500+700 in total to be eligible for bonus interest.,btohqsg
lol. ok. if is the grp chat rule I will respect it. I do not want to cause any disturbance and trouble.,btohqsg
Hi  I have only received a dollar plus rebate for Uob Evol for 2 consecutive months although my statement amount is more than $600. My spend includes online and wallet. Anyone has same issue?,btohqsg
do u have excluded spending like insurance / wallet top up etcs . excluded spending does not count towards the online / contactless,btohqsg
For contactless did you use card or phone/watch?,btohqsg
Utilities  UOB merchants(Cold storage  Starbucks  Giant  Polar  Breadtalk  ToastBox  Cathay  Chicha  Mr. Coconut  etc…) are excluded.,btohqsg
In short  have they read the tnc to know what is included?,btohqsg
didn't know UOB merchants was in the UOB evol exclusions list :/ just learn that today,btohqsg
not yet  i only gotten the card in Nov,btohqsg
for UOB EVOL .. the UOB$-exclusion is kinda... weird in a sense it applies to some cards in full  some cards in partiality,btohqsg
yes once u transfer from UOB to KF  u wld have a new 3 year expiry in your KF membership account  making it a total of 5years,btohqsg
"i think u could be mixing UOB$ and UNI$   they are different. but did not know that UOB evol excludes UOB$ merchants and the way for giving ""cashback"" is to be used for  spending at that merchant again   like how shopback is working for ""cashback""   need to spend at the same merchant to redeem the cashback",btohqsg
Roughly how far can we travel with 50k Krisflyer miles ?I don’t intend to upgrade flight just book a Norma economy,btohqsg
Very likely no. Most of the new Evol card holders will not read TnC.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/132360,btohqsg
i would vote UOB Evol as one of the hardest cards to use,btohqsg
To me  that is the only card good for me to hit min spend to earnOneinterest.,btohqsg
not UOB One Card to earn UOB One interest?can go for $500 tier mah,btohqsg
Some excludes base only (UoB lady’s )Some excludes in totality (UOB Krisflyer)Some don’t even exclude I think (UOB PRVI),btohqsg
not 3 months continuously to me.Using Evol  ok to skip 1 or 2 months.,btohqsg
oh my!! how can you skip earning 5% p.a. interest on UOB One account,btohqsg
based on the TNC ? yeah then its quite confusing,btohqsg
i would go for EVOL instead of UOB one  because 6.667% cashback,btohqsg
ya... dun use the account.. GIVE ME USE!,btohqsg
Can’t hit min $500 n no choice. Have to let it go.,btohqsg
Pay any monthly insurance directly w card lo  counts towardsaccount requirement,btohqsg
My insurance only accepts one lump sum payment per year.😔,btohqsg
Use XNAP with credit card to pay to food expanse in coffee shop and hawker center that accept  that can be helpful to meet the monthly requirement.,btohqsg
Ya. That is what I plan to try out next month using snack. Include Xnap also less than $500.,btohqsg
it works for sure since insurance is accepted,btohqsg
Currently i have capped at $1k miles card like hsbc revo and citi rewards and im also considering to get either dbs alt/citi premier to enjoy the lounge perksWhich card should i use for purchases like iphone/ipad which are more than $1k. Should i just use the 4mpd card though capped since total miles is still more than dbs alt/citi premier. Or any other miles card is a better option?,btohqsg
DBS woman card if online and below 1.5k or u can paywave at apple if below 2k using UOB VS,btohqsg
For me 1.6 cpm still expensive,btohqsg
Yes  it’s   as long as the mcc match,btohqsg
https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/promotion/dbs-altitude-miles?pid=sg-dbs-pweb-cardscc-cards-cards-dbs-altitude-miles39k miles if you spend 3000$ within 60 days with annual fees waived,btohqsg
Ohh sounds good! Thanks for sharing. Shall check it out,btohqsg
I would beg to differ.. it's the easiest for me,btohqsg
https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/travel/premiermiles-card/Citi PM card looks not bad but is only for new sign up only  since u have citi rewards. this should not be suitable for u,btohqsg
Then may I ask what credit card u all use to clock the ocbc 360 account requirement?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I’m trying to understand how this Moomoo platform works for Fullerton SG Cash Plus.1. I have $30k to invest. The T&C states ‘complete 8 cumulative buy trades’. Is there a way I should split the $30k deposit into 8 buy trades? eg. 3k x 8 times + 6k x 1x?2. If I do not use up the $30k deposit for buy trades  where does the money go?3. The T&C states ‘redeem rewards before 9:59PM SGT on 8/4/2024.’ Where do I redeem the rewards?,btohqsg
Do we get notify via email once amex true cashback card is approved?,btohqsg
in email i only see application received,btohqsg
It’s not that bad  the main difficulty is dodging UOB$ merchants. That aside  it’s a fairly straightforward online + mobile tap with min spend and standard exclusions.Must cherish it before it gets nerfed like Frank and Live Fresh.,btohqsg
have to monitor and split agar half half loh $300 $300,btohqsg
can even go higher of 350 / 250 since sometimes contactless is harder to hit,btohqsg
Second this... else i think UOB One? Not too sure about cashback card but it seems like the clear choice to me,btohqsg
Quite ok to track for EVOL  and technically no need zhun zhun 300 300  350 250 works too so there’s room for error. Maybank 5 cats even harder even with their tracker which don’t count unposted.,btohqsg
The annoying part about UOB One is the 3 month block (miss one month due to a late posting transaction and your whole quarter GG) and the bonus cashback tracking (I had missing bonus cashbacks in the past that took several months to resolve). Good thing is it’s not impacted by UOB$ merchants. Quite rewarding card if u spend a lot on the bonus merchants (e.g. SP  Grab  Shopee  DFI  McD),btohqsg
Anyone purchase Equity Fund in moomoo? looks interesting,btohqsg
You can split the 30k in different amounts and subscribe to the cash plus fund 8 times.Reward redemption you can go to the me tab and click my rewards.,btohqsg
I suggest if you want to fund 30k you can use the entire amount to subscribe the cash plus funds to get the interest.,btohqsg
Hi  for standard chartered prudential platinum  is there a monthly cap to their 0.29mpd insurance payment??,btohqsg
There is also a clause that u have to keep at least 10k for 90 days in order to unfreeze the rewards,btohqsg
Can’t claim for both  that’s for sure. But as to which one came first  I don’t see how anyone in the group here can answer that for you 😂,btohqsg
First  wish to understand if you have already registered for moomoo  and have you deposited any funds.  I have just finished the 6.8% guaranteed return period  have got the extra bonus promised by moomoo and has withdrawn out the return.  There is also reward US stocks given  therefore  you need to understand which promotion you are offered. Need help  give me a note. I have spoken to moomoo customer support many times to understand their marketing terms and conditions and misleading messages.,btohqsg
Yes  trade 8 times to subscribe your 30k  doesn’t matter if it is 7 times 1$ each and 8 times balance.  Yes must lock 10k for 90 days to get the us stocks for my promotion case.,btohqsg
Hi guys  just wanted to ask which platform would you recommend for a newbie long term investor? Choosing between WeBull or IBKR,btohqsg
IBKR has better fx for usd,btohqsg
main issue is spread. IBKR over weBull anyday,btohqsg
Compared 3 platforms here: Webull  Syfe  IBKR.https://youtu.be/wkA5FCaS-JE?si=fsBhSY-uxmCr_sq9I'm using IBKR myself,btohqsg
Ibkr  cheaper fx spread and access to more mkt,btohqsg
Just curious  will UOB launch any promo for April? Any need to empty UOB one account before 28 Mar? Pls share if anybody knows. Thx,btohqsg
Any advice for upcoming 6m t bill cut off yield bid?,btohqsg
Yes  bid the rate u wan. If for some strange reason u wan it no matter what  then jus put 0.1%,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask the money that set aside for Rising Dragon Savings Promotion.Is it still eligible for UOB one account interest rate 7.8% throughout the locking period of 4months ?,btohqsg
Think about it Why would anyone put money in the promo for 4 months if it means losing out 420 every month? lol,btohqsg
IBKR  financially more stable and less risk,btohqsg

Hi  can i ask for AMEX True Cashback card… i know there has been the nerf for grab top ups  but does it still count for eligible spend for singsaver?,btohqsg
i think you are better off read the TNC than asking here,btohqsg
hi all  does anyone know when is the last deadline for Tbills cpf application for OCBC bank?,btohqsg
Hi can I learn from you guys?My regular salary is paid to my UOB one accountIf I have an OCBC 360  and I transfer $ from my UOB one to OCBC and categorized it as salary.. will it be recognised as salary credit on my OCBC account for eligibility of higher interest?,btohqsg
no. ocbc only recognise corporate salary,btohqsg
You should change the crediting to ocbc 360 then self transfer to uob one instead,btohqsg
Are u able to meet the min $500 credit card spending every month?,btohqsg
buy e capita voucher using general credit card will earn the rebate right?,btohqsg
No ah. Mcc 6540 mostly excluded,btohqsg
hi all  how long does it take for the UOB one interest checker for salary and card spend to be updated?,btohqsg
i am new to the UOB one account,btohqsg
Hi all  after obtaining the credit card sign up bonus，are there any period I must retain the card or can cancel immediately and repeat next year.,btohqsg
You can check the t&c for the accurate info,btohqsg
Curious.. which bank's tracker is this?,btohqsg
if i already have 100k in my UOB account. which other saving acc should i ask my employer to credit my salary to  to maximize interest across the savings accs?,btohqsg
as im aware that i can paynow under the SALA code to UOB,btohqsg
ocbc only allows corporate account for salary crediting,btohqsg
i see! what other savings acc are like UOB where i can credit using paynow?,btohqsg
Dbs multiplier 🤮 lol through PayNow/FAST transfer,btohqsg
But multiplier account even with salary plus spend can only get 1.8%,btohqsg
Hi Oscar  I have another question LOL,btohqsg
For Yuu  when we use the card on foodpanda for example  if you food is worth $12  and then delivery is another $4  does $16 go towards the $600 count? Or is it only $12?,btohqsg
Thank you!! to whoever can answer this haha,btohqsg
May I check for UOB one account and UOB Stash account. Assuming uob one has reached 100k already  can I withdraw a portion of the salary to park under Stash acct every mth so that it is higher than previous month? /,btohqsg
Yes  leave 100k in UOB One  and transfer the amount that exceeds to your stash. thats fine,btohqsg
But i dont see why u would use stash. If ur stash is below 70k  it gives 0 to 2%.If u put excess in ocbc  with salary criteria alone  its 2% for anything $ below 75k. If u manage the balance and get the save criteria also  u can get 3.2%,btohqsg
"For me.. stash only makes sense to me for ""stashing"" exactly $100k to earn 3.05% with no need to do anything  hassle free.",btohqsg
Investment in usd etf - poems or interactive brokers? Which is more competitive?,btohqsg
Cos I have always been under ocbc 365 for many yrs but they hv so many criteria.1. I credit a salary of at least S$1 800 via GIRO/PayNow via GIRO2. I have increased my average daily balance by at least S$500 monthly3. I spend at least S$500 on my OCBC 365  OCBC INFINITY  OCBC NXT  OCBC 90°N or OCBC Rewards Card4. I have purchased an eligible insurance product5. I have purchased an eligible investment product6. I have maintained at least S$200 000 account balanceI only can maintain 3 out of 6 all these yrs  even for some people with max 200k there already also no use.While UOB stash  the rules seems simpler. Just step up every mth. You maintain 100k there  u meet 5%pa,btohqsg
200k is a trap  bonus interest only on 100k,btohqsg
Ok! So when the foodpanda arrived  only $12 was credited instantly,btohqsg
what u mean by $12 credited instantly?,btohqsg
UOB Stash effective interest rate is only 3% overall btw  not 5%,btohqsg
You left out the * part for first 1500 customers each week,btohqsg
3%* for UOB Stash account.200k in OCBC 360 gives you only 4% p.a. No one puts 200k in OCBC 360.,btohqsg
Hi allJust wana check how UOB signature visa calculated the UNI$ rewards?I spent locally $5900N I was rewarded 3600 uni$Pls highlight 🙏🏻🍀,btohqsg
9x bonus points capped for $2k local paywave/petrol monthly. 9x2000÷5=3600 uni$,btohqsg
Thanks 🙏🏻So the rest $3900 I spent awarded nothing 😅😅,btohqsg
Best to check t&c before spend 👍🏻,btohqsg
should have gotten up front 1 uni$ per $5 block per transaction for eligible spend under the $5900.,btohqsg
Is it for certain merchants onli?,btohqsg
Does foodpanda delivery charges count towards $600 min spend?,btohqsg

Anyone applies for tiger boss debit card? Reviews or thoughts?,btohqsg
i applied for fun but dun intend to use it as credit cards provide a much btr reward rate,btohqsg
all merchants so long not excluded,btohqsg
You are right  effective rate 3%,btohqsg
Has anyone tried whether can combine cdc voucher and capitavoucher to buy something?,btohqsg
Look like you did not read the credit card TnC before using it. Perhaps you want to read it first? There are many other clauses you may want to know too.,btohqsg
Seems like you didn’t read the T&C carefully enough 😂Surely deposit 100k and taking it out 3 days later to get one free AAPL share must be too good to be true,btohqsg
You will need to spend 900 this month to hit the requirement,btohqsg
You need to maintain the amount for a period of days. Where got so good let you put in 1 day take out next day give you free share,btohqsg
I have read the tnc  many times. But my special case which I mention  is that i will take the frozen share first. Withdraw 100k  then... at later date put in 100k to fulfil the 90days criteria  but after 2months of getting the frozen share,btohqsg

I beg to differ on the ocbc calculations from@MelvynEzi.For ocbc 200k (assuming salary  increment  and 200k criteria met  effectively is only 3.2%  becos the 4%+2.4% only applies to first 100k  u average out  its only 3.2% on the whole 200k.i.e.not worth putting 200k in ocbc360,btohqsg

Hi moomoo users  may I ask if anyone has managed to deposit cash from bank to moomoo on a Sunday? Is it immediate?I am thinking if i deposit via DDA from DBS to moomoo on 31st 9am  will it reach on 31st march?(Asking becos i intend to subscibe by before 1st april 0000hrs),btohqsg
Transfer in is immediate if using correct method. But Subscribe takes 2-4 days.,btohqsg
Besides UOB one Which is 2nd best to put in 100k?Std chart is revolving every 2 months. Ocbc as above does not seem attractive,btohqsg
Correct method means?I previously did a DDA transfer using the moomoo app  link to my DBS acct. I did it on Saturday  it was immediate. But i didnt try a sunday😱,btohqsg
For shoppee installment plans  which credit card to use?,btohqsg
Means your transfer is immediate. To subscribe the cash fund  it will take another 2-4 days.,btohqsg
Yes  subscribe to confirmation to PL computation take around 2 days. But I have asked moomoo cso  as long as i click the subscribe button before 1st april 10pm  i am considered for the welcome reward.Thank you for the share!,btohqsg
hi guys  i signed up for the webull moneybull yesterday.i understand that the idle funds will be transferred into the moneybull SGD or USD funds every morning at 0730 and 0930.based on what I am reading  i would assume it is automatically transferred as long as i dont retain or deactivate.when the funds get transferred into the moneybull  does it take any processing time? because i am not really seeing any updates in my moneybull  it still shows $0 in both USD and SGD,btohqsg
Hihi  do you also keep a separate 100k in UOB one acct? Can we simultaneously earn 5% in uob1 and 3% in stash?,btohqsg
"Yes u can. Its called the ""duo"" in uob on website's marketing.But i still suggest put uob one 100k and ocbc360 100k instead.(Stash is only 3%  ocbc360 is 4% with salary+save criteria)",btohqsg
Hi gurus  can I check with you for yuu merchants  do we get 9x base points for every dollar spent or 10x base points with the dbs yuu card?

Thanks so much!!,btohqsg
Same as my suggestion above. 100k uob one  then ocbc360 100k,btohqsg

Hi all   anyone has the UOB ladies solitare card?  the requirements is 120k annual salary.But my friend that got it did not even come close to that salary he said  roughly 60k. I am also around there but I failed to apply for it. Anyone successfully got it with pay < 60k?I think the difference is that I did not credit salary directly to uob one  but use bank transfer for the interests.,btohqsg
think ur friend applied last year when they are not strict on the requirement  nowadays even with $120k income may not get the card also,btohqsg
Ok thanks for info  you are right on the timings... my friend with over 100k applied last month and failed to get it too.,btohqsg
Hi guys  if i purchase add-on baggage in JPY from scoot separately after buying the flight tickets  does this qualify for UOB lady's card (travel category) 6mpd (4 mpd after 31 march)?thinking of whether to using the UOB KF card or amaze + lady's card. I have already met the $800 SIA spending for UOB KF card. Thank you!!!,btohqsg
Hello guys  new to lady’s solitare. From your experience what is the 2 best categories to choose from? I chose dining and travel  but at the same time i dont travel all the time so i was thinking of changing travel to another cat.,btohqsg
It’s down to your own spending pattern and what other cards you have  there is no “best” that will apply to everyone. For each quarter  assess what you will need and what your other cards may not cover  and apply accordingly.,btohqsg
Your initial choice Travel/Dining is the best combi in my opinioneven after nerf to 4mpd in april  there remains no other card that can cater for Travel Bookings for 4mpd up to $2k per month (UOB VS maybe but needs to be contactless spending if in SGD).,btohqsg
Gotcha! Thanks for the input 😊,btohqsg
anyone can share which app or website can check and optimise credit card?,btohqsg
anyone received their $880 eCapitaVoucher from SNACK already?,btohqsg

Ya i kena this.. Two months 10k on the third month $486 because i was in hospital for three weeks and wasnt out spending,btohqsg
OMG u charged $10k each for 2 months to UOB One card? Why???,btohqsg
Didnt really keep track as my habit is all food on ocbc 365 all hospital bills and insurances on the amex trucashback 1.7% then all other entertainment expenses on uob one,btohqsg
Something like that.. I know dumb lol,btohqsg
Anyway this card is good for hospital bills too,btohqsg
yes it is good for those hospital payments which they don't allow you to push to Health Hub,btohqsg
This is 1.5% once that 1.7% card hit limit and dont allow u to do anymore temp increase,btohqsg
Only heartpain when they announce dont allow anymore grab top up,btohqsg
wah lau your hospital bill size... i hope everything is ok.. and more importantly can claim insurance!!,btohqsg
I am sort of forced to retire due to my medical condition.. So now almost everything rely on my passive income,btohqsg
eh... you got read the updates hor.. i cannot remember which Amex cards exclude insurance and hospitalisation from a certain date liaoi know UOB Amex Absolute still OK.. Amex Truecashback i am not 100% sure,btohqsg
Hence very into all these card rebates and high interest acct etc,btohqsg
So far i still got the rebates up to March for both cards. Will look out for any changes thanks bro,btohqsg
Anyone have any idea if they ask for income documents updates and i dont submit anything what will happen?,btohqsg
Will they stop the card or lower the limits? Frankly my income from 5digits drop to 4 digits alr because of my health but i dare not ask the banks dont want to alert them 打草惊蛇,btohqsg
depends on the wordingis it a friendly optional letter.. update your income with us and get $10 cash rebate..ORWE REQUIRE YOU TO PROVIDE YOUR LATEST INCOME DOCUMENTS,btohqsg
But on the whole  if your hosp bills are covered by insurance  and you still collect your salary  and you drop your spending significantly  it should cover for the $200 loss 😅🤪,btohqsg

My Overseas Travel Card Spend Strategy 2024https://youtu.be/Kkkg1o_eWvo,btohqsg
Wonder if any experienced this before. I paid a restaurant in Taiwan shopping mall w UOB Lady + Amaze. MCC showed up as 5311 instead of dining. 🥲,btohqsg
Uob lady is a good start. Have Uob kf as a backup.,btohqsg
is 5311 under shopping? i just paid in korea lotte departmental store  dinner classified as shopping,btohqsg
For Japan. Korea. Taiwan.It is very common for all shops inside major malls to be coded as mcc 5311 (department store). Yes even their in house supermarket.If u want to be safe before making big purchase. Use amaze + empty wallet to check the mcc.,btohqsg
https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/retirement-income/retirement-withdrawals/how-is-the-withdrawable-amount-computedI have some questions for 20% RA withdrawal at 651. is this a special scenario for those who doesn’t want to utilise CPF LIFE?2. since RA for most people is just FRS+interest   how does someone have more RA than FRS or even ERS3. Is there a scenario where withdrawing the 20% is better than utilising CPF LIFE ?,btohqsg
There is actually another chat where there is a bird who is expert on CPF rules.,btohqsg
anyone here know about investing on S&P500?,btohqsg
yea i also kena. lucky its just for lunch i think $25 or so,btohqsg
hi master  is there any way i can add my uob cc to my apple pay without receiving my cc physical card yet?,btohqsg
1. Not special scenario. If you don't want CPF Life  you can purchase an annuity plan that may have worser payouts for the same premium (this may change in the future)2. Top-up and mandatory contributions3. You have usage of the monies with some sacrifices to payouts,btohqsg
Last I recall no  only Google Pay can,btohqsg
I am curious also... dont u need the cvc?,btohqsg
Adding cc to google pay and using googlepay,btohqsg
Uh just add through UOB TMRW? That's all you need to do,btohqsg
Oh wow. Thank you! Didnt know this could be done. Cool!👍👍👍,btohqsg
Hi  was doing some research was thinking of applying for a credit card. As a student what would be the best card with no minimum spend for cash back and miles,btohqsg
credit card will need income though,btohqsg
Same for me. Meal at Din Tai Fung at Taipei 101 was classified as shopping. 😩,btohqsg
1. No  u can do the withdrawal and still have CPF Life.2. The theoretical max is to transfer/top up to ERS once your RA is formed at 55 years old and let it compound (including mandatory contributions) from there.3. The 20% withdrawal gives u a lump sum liquidity  at the expense of lower CPF Life payouts subsequently; whether that is beneficial or not depends on individual circumstances. E.g. if u have occasional unplanned big spending  doing the 20% withdrawal may make sense as it allows u to have enough spare cash to fund those spending as and when they arise.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if ocbc infinity card gives cashback for SimplyGo?,btohqsg
VOO or CSPX depending on preference and which exchange you have access,btohqsg
i understand amaze converts offline to online transactionbut what if i want to make a foreign currency online transactioncan i use amaze to still earn miles and their exchange rate?,btohqsg
Yes  u can. It will be charged as a SGD online transaction to the linked card  with the MCC of the original foreign currency transaction. U will earn the linked card rewards assuming the MCC is eligible.,btohqsg

Hi Chris  according to the Singsaver's T&Cs for the travel insurance promo  it seems to say 2mpd reward. did it get reduced?,btohqsg
2 sets of t&cs. each earning 2 mpd  can refer to the post here at the bottom. I was confused too and clarified with SingSaverhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/182431,btohqsg
if i have more cards with UOB  i would priortise UOB cards first like me so i would go for 2 then 5 then 1,btohqsg
The only other uob card I have is the amex card and uob one,btohqsg
so u only have 2 uob cards excluding cashback cards?,btohqsg
Uob oneUob visa signatureUob amexUob ppv!!,btohqsg
Here is what I published recently on S&P500https://youtu.be/lvnuh3Ituqw?si=UdAVnbGyQ0YqvfMr,btohqsg
i wld just stick to 2 5 then 1. once u exhausted your 4-6mpd cards then use your general spending ones like citi premier,btohqsg
to me personally cashback cards are not worth it as the benefits lacks behind miles cards by alot,btohqsg
Just worry about the exchange rate. Dk which one better,btohqsg
just use the amaze card combo if u are worried abt that,btohqsg
hence option 1 would be ur first choice,btohqsg
Can I check. Can I use the amaze card thru the app? Like without the physical card? Just tap using hp?Or must add amaze card to Samsung pay or Google pay?,btohqsg
Guaranteed returns 3-4% p.a. or 3-4% profit after 10 years lol.You said savings plan right? Savings plan won't have investment portion.If have investments  usually are ILPs  did you check profits after fees?,btohqsg
Yeap mine is ILP  for endowments then is 3-4% P.A haha,btohqsg
Savings plan you'll pay about 3% more if you switch to monthly. You'll probably end up only break even at 15 years lol.,btohqsg
You will get 2% discount if you pay yearly  but ya true because of the charges  that’s why I do with ILP  6% dividends and can do 500/month,btohqsg
Don't forget to count in the charges for ILP. Depending on how much and how long you put  you might be charged at least 2-4% p.a. so eventual state  your effective yield may probably be 2% or less p.a.,btohqsg
Yeap thanks haha mine is 1.75% P.A. so abit better. 6% + it’s growing so still quite ok,btohqsg
That's the only redeeming quality. There's still chance to grow. But even with average 4% p.a. growth  I counted max also 3% p.a. effective yield.,btohqsg
Yeap 👍👍 true  so my effective yield still quite good,btohqsg
Haha with average of 4% then Yeap  mine so far doing ok ba so effective yield about 7-8% after charges  BUT I have only been doing slightly over a year so will continue to monitor,btohqsg
"Remember your charges are not on your premiums but on your total portfolio including ""welcome bonuses""",btohqsg
Yeap counted that too but it’s ok cause the 6% dividend is also based on total portfolio haha thanks for the reminder,btohqsg
Hi all  are there any other accounts beside ega  for cc bill payments or mortgages or taxes?,btohqsg
I always hear horror stories about ILP. Thanks for sharing your positive story. Mine didnt turn out that great like yours. 👍,btohqsg
ILP is just an inefficient investment vehicle.If the underlying investment made 50%  the ILP COULD still make 40% for example.ILP just cannot win investing by yourself or using a more efficient vehicle. Does not mean CANNOT MAKE MONEYlook at Snack... even that can make money .. LOL,btohqsg
Yeap nothing beats investing yourself!!I mainly use ILP for my Uob acc so I don’t have to bother about the $500/month spending haha,btohqsg
Does it depends what kind of ILP too?I understand that long ago ILP is lump together with life & investment thus when u get older the investment portion is eaten away by the mortality rates. Also the charges are much higher I previously.But currently  they have reduced charges  limited payment term and full investment only - is it still as bad?,btohqsg
Just inefficient loh..Basically higher fees overall. Think of it as a handicap on your investment. But if bet on the right horse  you can still make money  but the ILP provider takes a share of your profits (WHETHER YOU MAKE MONEY OR NOT).,btohqsg
Depends on insurers and the charges also  if the charges too high then it’s harder to make money also,btohqsg
but if u see the graph   snack lost money before that,btohqsg
My thoughts. On income funds  if it is managed by the institution themselves (Ex: SG United Fund managed by UOB)  it can be considered as well especially for those who are not financial savvy and still get want to get the benefits.,btohqsg
or best if you look at the very start since inception its losing alot of money,btohqsg
yeah .. but it is not true that ILP cannot make money..JUST HANDICAPPED,btohqsg
"You're better off putting in roboinvestor. The fees are typically lower and some even give ""cashback"" as certain funds usually give commission to advisors  which don't exist when you subscribe directly via roboinvestments.",btohqsg
its like paying $10 to ask someone buy chicken rice for u. u still get to eat it  but u could have bought it on ur own at $4.,btohqsg
yeah handicap especially the higher fees for the fund,btohqsg
You still pay $4.. but you share your chicken with other ppl,btohqsg
oh  and u have to puke out all or part of wat u ate if u decide to stop eating halfway.,btohqsg
Haha no la. You still get to keep what you ate but the rest you give the person who buy for you,btohqsg
i mean the surrender charge for the first 10 years or so. u surrender first 2 year  u get nothing back =\,btohqsg
Oh yes. That's true. Then need to puke out 🤣,btohqsg
hahaha chicken rice example not very appropriate la.. but that's the rough idea,btohqsg
but personally i feel ILP is like forcing yourself to save   its like for those people without discipline,btohqsg
ILP is forcing yourself to become god of wealth lol,btohqsg
i would say its more like u paying people (fees) to force yourself to save 😂  Getting rich off ILP   i dont think so,btohqsg
Suddenly got feels for chicken rice,btohqsg
Lol. When u are someone need people to  care for yr own money. Then u are in deep shit. Sadly lots of common people does. 🤣.,btohqsg
BUT you can 'force yourself to save' with so many other ways...you can do DCA using a discount broker too..,btohqsg
I think that's not a good justification to pick up ILP. if the issue is discipline  then the person sld learn to be disciplined  not buy a lousy substitute,btohqsg
i guess some people prefer simpler as ILP is literally dumping to your insurance company and not doing anything but for like DCA u will need to login to setup etc,btohqsg
Just received news that American Express x SingSaver welcome offers will be halted tomorrow  those who want to sign up  try to do it within todayTrue Cashback (New only)https://t.me/HMSGHive/1585KrisFlyer Blue (New only)https://t.me/HMSGHive/1587KrisFlyer Ascend (New + Existing)https://t.me/HMSGHive/1586The Platinum Charge S$1 744 (New + Existing)https://t.me/HMSGHive/1589Platinum card (New + Existing)https://t.me/HMSGHive/1588,btohqsg
theres no other reason to justify why people is buying ILP . Some of my friends have ILP and its because they cant save money on their own ( which falls to discipline issues )   which they see 7% PA growth and after xx years become million $ which obviously is not guaranteed,btohqsg
sign up ILP also not easy mah.. must meet in person and sign forms or what right.starting a DCA is arguably easier.. can do everything yourself online.,btohqsg

Hi can check for citibank card  giro from ega 1st attempt fail due to insufficient fund  will there be any 2nd attempt or we have to pay manually?,btohqsg
For Citi  advice to u is deposit money into EGA 3 working days before due date,btohqsg
Am I right I cannot use other hsbc ega account to giro pay my credit card? (For the 1% rebate),btohqsg
? U can use other people ega to giro your cc as long as they agreed. I use mine for my mum card,btohqsg
How to set this up? Thanks,btohqsg
Manual giro form from the individual bank. Just need the acct holder to sign the form to agree to giro from their hsbc ega,btohqsg
Owner of account needs to fill the form. Need your card number  NRIC and name to be filled on the form as well.Usually GIRO have business reply envelope  exception of Citibank.,btohqsg
Oh I see. Then take long to process then thanks,btohqsg
Earliest 1 week  latest 2 months,btohqsg
Am I right only giro get 1% else no such rebate on hsbc ega?,btohqsg
Benefits follows people who willing to work for it,btohqsg
It depend on how much u stand to get from the giro. I spend 30k per month roughly so i get 300 cashback each month so i dont mind setting it up since it is worth the 1 time set up effort,btohqsg
It also give cashback when u giro insurance  income tax  other bills,btohqsg

hi  seeking some clarifications. anyone know how does an accumulating fund works in Endowus? understand that the dividend will be reinvested  so is this done monthly or daily? then the new capital is the initial capital plus the dividend  which is also recalculated monthly or daily?,btohqsg
Can use Mastercard to top up  no fee and also no rewards.,btohqsg
Thank you for replying :)Appreciate it!!,btohqsg
Accumulating fund basically means the fund will not pay out any dividends to unitholders(you). Any dividends received from the underlying stocks held by the fund will be added into cash balance of the fund and the portfolio manager will then decide how to deploy the cash e.g. buy more stocks(reinvest).,btohqsg

Can I check how to count if the interested given for the tbill is correct? Cause this round only 94% allocated. TIA 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Since when does t bill give interest?U mean:1. refund amount for the unsuccessful allocation as well as2. refund of excess amount paid on successful allocation?,btohqsg
I see website says  100-(182/365 x 3.8%),btohqsg
Is it need to x94% again?,btohqsg
Usually it won’t be wrong one  but it should roughly be:1. 6% of your initial amount (unsuccessful)2. (100-98.105) x 94% of your initial amount,btohqsg
Somehow 1+2 is not equal to the amount I get,btohqsg
That’s why I’m curious on this.,btohqsg
It’s approx 94% allocation for non comp.So there might be some rounding involved.,btohqsg
Cause I put in 30k and I receive back 1549. Then I see 6% of 30k is already 1.8k le. That’s why I puzzled,btohqsg
1. $1000 refund for unsuccessful2. $549.55 refund for excess paid on $29k notional allocated at 98.105 price.,btohqsg
Now it seem correct. 🙏🏻 but how you know is $1k not successful,btohqsg
Because u said u got back $1549,btohqsg
So 94% of 30k is 28200 so they round up to 29k  is it always like that?,btohqsg
I didn’t read the mechanism in full but if it is like ssb  how they do it some will get rounded up some will get rounded down. In order for everyone to be in $1000 pieces and everything allocated out.,btohqsg
Got it now  thanks a lot 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg
If I have both UOB one account and Stash account then better to make it empty both the account? If there is new promotion open then can I join separately each account?,btohqsg
Means only one account is eligible?,btohqsg
As stated in t&c  one account holder can only have participation at one time,btohqsg
So empty one account by 30Mar 1030pm?,btohqsg
Me doing for the first time.... Very confusing.....,btohqsg
Some say must do today because of public holiday,btohqsg
When you go hiking  do you walk alone the edge of cliff? 1030pm is at the edge of cliff.6pm provides a safety buffer. Of course you can do it at 7pm or before 6pm depends on your preference.,btohqsg
Nobody knows the next promo TnC. All base on TnC of past promo. If have promo  read bank announcements on 01 April.,btohqsg
i had 200k for 4 days...planning to $0 today..so next 4 days my account $0..MAB still at 100k,btohqsg
Make sure you did your calculations  at most you lose a couple of $ of interest,btohqsg
thanks bro..i did via excel..my MAB should exceed by $10..loljust sometimes duno how they count..diff from my calculations always a few dollars..,btohqsg
i always had 100k everyday this month..then for 4 days..i had 200k..today zero out should be fine,btohqsg
The interest is credited into your account in two transactions. First transaction is about $3.xx to $4.xx. I guess the difference you mentioned is that base interest $4.xx,btohqsg
me and their calculated base same... it's the bonus.. they always diff from wat i count...lol,btohqsg
The base interest has very small margin of error because it's only 0.5%. Highly likely that some of your daily end of day on your excel is wrong. The easiest error to spot is Sunday have a different end of day balance from Saturday.To be very accurate  use the account transactions instead of what you see on the account balance.,btohqsg
Uob max transfer limit is $200k only. Any way on how to bypass this? I have slightly over 200k and wish to withdraw all of them out into another bank acc,btohqsg
ya..i sus 31 days of DAB.. somewhere there along is diff..wat the sat and sun diff all about bro?,btohqsg
If Saturday end of day balance is 99000  Sunday is 99000. Which means Monday needs to be 102000 to balance out.,btohqsg
oh.....damn!... didn't know this..no wonder MAB always differ abit,btohqsg
The moment on excel your Sunday is different from Saturday then your calculation is wrong already lol. Like I said previously  use account transactions instead of what you see on the account balance.,btohqsg
thanks..found the culprit today liao! it's the sunday! haha,btohqsg
they take which as end day balance?current balance right?not available balance,btohqsg
Someone shd create a video on MAB calculation 😁 sure alot of clicks for years to come,btohqsg
Current balance. But like I mentioned  use account transactions instead of what you see on the account balance to be 100% accurate.,btohqsg
ok got it..suns and PHs..no movement...just take the prior days' DAB,btohqsg
Since account transactions also include transaction date.,btohqsg
regret didn't remove stash acc bonus interest that time..had to recalculate and stick to a silly amount of 100016 every month for the MAB..,btohqsg
Lol it will literally be a video on how to login to banking app  opening a spreadsheet and doing + and -. Lol,btohqsg
hi all  i’ve set up giro to pay my citi reward cc with hsbc ega  and my citi due day is 30 marchas there’re 3 non-business days before  will the giro pay in time before due? in other words  should i pay manually on 30 march?and what if the giro got triggered today and only reach citi after due date?i’ve asked hsbc and they’re not able to give a definite answer. thank yall in advance!,btohqsg
"If its so simple just ""doing + and -""  u would be insulting many of those who had trouble computing monthly average balance properly. A quick search above would show there has been at least 3-4 chat discussions on this before..There are much more common misunderstandings that we didnt know about the bank's way of computing. Would appreciate if you could refrain oversimplifying with your expert knowledge. It hurts our feelings as beginners as we start out learning things",btohqsg
My apologies if it sounded insulting. You can try out the accounts transaction method and see if it helps.1. Open a spreadsheet with all the days in the month you're calculating.2. Login to your banking app and take the end of day balance from last month as the reference balance.3. By default  set all days of the month to be the same balance (do not key in manually but use = in the formula).4. Periodically login to your banking app and check your transactions based on the transaction date  do not change the balance manually but calculate with + and - in the formula.5. After the last day  use average formula to get estimated MAB.6. Top-up/withdraw if you need to adjust the MAB.,btohqsg
What is the minimum account balance to maintain in the basic uob savings account ?,btohqsg
The difference would probably be when the bank actually records down your new balance if you had transactions in or out. If you really need to calculate MAB  just check periodically and do the necessary deposit or withdrawal to maintain your MAB,btohqsg
if you've set up GIRO arrangement  leave the deduction trigger with Citibank and not worry about being late. hope this helps,btohqsg
My due date is also 30th March. It already deducted yesterday.,btohqsg
Is this your first giro deduction on this card?,btohqsg
When did you setup your giro?,btohqsg
Very basic rule: until you don’t see a word “GIRO” in your statement  pay manually 😅,btohqsg
These are my notes from what i have learnt about adjusting and predicting MAB over the past month. I thought these would be useful to people starting out. Please feel free to correct me if i am wrong.(Tested for OCBC  so it might be different for other banks).1. Ledger balance number updates immediately after each transaction that happen  but not necessary used for bank's MAB calculation2. Only ONE single ledger balance number is used by bank at the end of a working day. The snapshot of the ledger balance happen at different time on each working day for different banks3. Converse to 2.  the ledger balance (in the eyes of the bank) doesnt change at the end of a non-working day. ie. the previous working day's ledger balance will be assumed at the end of a non-working day.4. if calculating MAB using transactions  note that transactions will only be recognised by bank on a working day.5. converse to 4.  if the transaction happen on a non-working day  the transaction will be recognised only on the next working day. ie. it will be as if the transaction happened on the next working day.6. In order to adjust for the last day's MAB  best is to do ledger balance adjustment on a few *working days* before end of month  and ensure no transactions occur until end of month7. In eyes of banks  the MAB number is updated everyday  but the ledger balance only updates at end of a working day8. To ocbc  sundays and public holidays are non-working day (note: saturdays are considered working),btohqsg
i received sms informing successful setup on 15 March,btohqsg
Should be fine but if on 30 you don't see the transaction then just manually pay already,btohqsg
my statement came (4 march) even before giro setup(15 march)…,btohqsg
For the SC bonus saver account  is there any walkaround with the salary crediting?,btohqsg
as today is the last business day before 30 and the giro will not be done on non-business day  can i just assume it wouldn’t come..?,btohqsg
Last business day is 30  so still have chance. But I think because your GIRO set-up after your statement  may be better off manually pay,btohqsg
GIRO setup was after the statement. I think you are not getting the idea how it works in the first place,btohqsg
so long your statement (at the point of generation) does not indicate that payment is under GIRO arrangement  you need to do it manually. it'll be in giro arrangement in the next statement instead,btohqsg
1. His statement doesn’t state that it will be deducted via GIRO.2. No chance as Citi deducted yesterday for due date 30th Mar,btohqsg
okay got it thanks guys  never expected such detailed responses.appreciate it and have a great day and weekends ahead!,btohqsg

Dear friends  I'm new to this community pls pardon my question if too noob: I've UOB one card  what is the best and cheapest way to clock $500/mth debit/credit spending to earn high interest overseas  as I will be travelling to Malaysia and China next few months 🙏,btohqsg
Don’t think UOB one is a good choice for overseas spend,btohqsg
If its for uob one account interests  you can bill your insurance to uob one debit card.,btohqsg
Yes but my insurance is low amount and there's spare to spend. In sg I usually hit 500/mth with retail and dining spending. Wonder if there's any strategy when I'm overseas,btohqsg
Pass me the credit card. I help u spend 😂Jokes aside. I believe u can still do online platform spend there? Like buy things from taobao and get them delivered to ur malaysia and china address. Suppose u would need to spend alot on living supplies.Or u could also buy evouchers online. Eg.Fairprice. So you can delay spending them  and when u return to sg then spend them before expiry,btohqsg

Sorry  very confused. If we withdraw and empty out uob one 100k out today  we lose just a few days interest or the whole month interest if we did not hit the MAB of 100k?,btohqsg
Ur MAB will drop (lets say to 95k) then the interest will be calculated based on that. its not a all in or noth,btohqsg
Tks Cheng. So if MAB not 100k  will not get the 5% even if fulfill rest of the criteria right?,btohqsg
will get 4.xx% for 9x k,btohqsg
not effective 5%. its the tiered system so effective 4.xx,btohqsg
OK ok. So it's still better to withdraw just in case got promo again. Tks so much all...,btohqsg
I have a UOB Stash account (not UOB one account). If I withdraw today for safety precautions  and let's say the account states that $25 000 is required to top up to earn bonus interest  what does it mean? Will I still receive bonus interest until this date  or will I not receive it at all if I don’t top up?,btohqsg
anyway can topup now and empty before saturday10.30pm to get as close to 100k MAB as possible,btohqsg
not receive bonus interest for the month if mab this month is not at least equal or higher than that last month,btohqsg
OK cool. Just to make sure I understand  Top up another 100k today  withdraw on Sat  then MAB remains 100k. Got it. Tks Trazora.,btohqsg
After the withdrawal if this is showing like no topup required then will get bonus interest right?,btohqsg

I cant verify this if my source is valid… but from last quarter my friend called UOB service officer hotline and they mentioned that if didnt take out on 29th Dec (30th is sat  31st is sun). Balance counted for 31st dec will be as of 29th Dec end balance. which was what was reflected for him (he took out on 30th dec) but his “as of 31st balance” was taken from 29th Dec,btohqsg

differs from bank to bank   as the miles are partnership of the bank with the airlines,btohqsg
Is this deal good? And the card?,btohqsg
Deal is the best for now. Card depends on your usage pattern.Here is my review on SC Simply Cashhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGOzl0RnR9w,btohqsg

Sorry just to check.If in the event there is new promo cut off from 31/03/24.1) we must register within these few days? or wait till there is a new promo then register via the link. (current is still from 31st Dec 2023)2) If above not done  even we trf out to become $0 is not valid?3) Heard must received the reply mail approval then considered as entering into the promo?,btohqsg
UOB one card can get the additional cashback if spend to buy giant / cold storage vouchers ?,btohqsg
Yes  transaction looks the same on my statement compared to normal groceries.,btohqsg
This action is in anticipation of another rising dragon. Irregardless whether there is promotion or not  the 100k will put back on 1st Apr to earn the 5%.,btohqsg
1. You want you can do now or wait for next promo that may or may not happen.2. Yes  still based on 31 Dec.3. There will not be an approval email. Only registration  whether approved or not will depend if they earmark your amount and cash credit or not.,btohqsg
Meaning i do now the following.1) Remove the $100k and put back on 01/04/24.2) In the event there is new Rising Dragon promo: I can then register from the new window since I have already done the emptying by 31/03/24.3) Then wait for them to earmark,btohqsg
If you maintained 100k from 1 Mar till today  and wish to withdraw completely on 30 Mar for next promo  but still want to maintain MAB for 5% EIR bonus interest  you can deposit 100k today  and withdraw 200k on 30 Mar.,btohqsg
Ah understood. Haha. No lah  no need to go until so all out. Lol,btohqsg
At most lose few bucks haha.,btohqsg
ya precisely.Can close eyes about it. Thanks.,btohqsg
Early morning sir. 9am or so? Before noon definitely,btohqsg
Maybe can double check again. See on bank statement if transfer is shown as 2 Jan or 30 Dec. Maybe his early morning is 31 Dec early morning?,btohqsg
Surprisingly no frenzy here about uob lady savings account....,btohqsg
Haha you can start the frenzy.. can rally the other ladies with the account also,btohqsg
TLDR: my recommendation for ladies is to open UOB Lady Savings account and put $10 001 inside. And make sure you choose 2 Lady categories that you can confidently hit $2k a month. You will benefit more overall compared to not opening the UOB Lady Savings account.LOSE $33 interest monthlyGAIN $60 value in miles monthly,btohqsg
Up to 10mpd when combined with UOB Lady's Card.,btohqsg
this is thrash marketing.. the sweet spot is $10 001 for 2mpd bonus,btohqsg
It's always trash marketing.. just like PoWeR dUo with UOB One and stash account..,btohqsg
https://invest.sg.moomoo.com/luckyshare20232?channel=2300&subchannel=2Moomoo giving out free grab share,btohqsg
I was withdrawing cash out from moo moo and it prompt me to redeem 🫨,btohqsg
What about vs UOB one account. Provided I hit the 2k ladies spending. Also can I stack them? Hit both the 500 min spending for one and also additional 2mpd for ladies account.,btohqsg
Think 6 mpd is very power already,btohqsg
The bigger qn is  with these new changes  will they allow UOB Lady's card series spending to still be eligible for UOB One account bonus interest criteria?,btohqsg
As above  if can stack  ladies will probably benefit overall. But if they can't stack  then have to think again.,btohqsg
Uob max transfer limit is $200k only. Any way on how to bypass this? I have slightly over 200k and wish to withdraw all of them out into another bank acc,btohqsg
2 separate things in my opinion.UOB One savings account is to earn the 5% p.a. interest on $100k cash. Super charged by ear mark promos now and then.UOB Lady savings account is to help you earn extra 2mpd on your UOB Lady card if you willing to lock up $10k in a useless savings account.,btohqsg
UOB ONE credit card FTW!ok jokes aside.. then have to use UOB Evol liao loh if you cannot use UOB One credit card.MY GUESS IS.. IT WILL NOT CHANGE... UOB Lady still can contribute to the $500 min spend.It is afterall 2 different things.One is spend counter.One is earn bonus miles by locking up cash.,btohqsg
have a joint account.. and use human B to transfer out another $200k.Although i am rather surprised.. is there any reason to keep more than $100k in UOB,btohqsg
My acc was empty for half of the month,btohqsg
Guess we'll know in Apr. But I'll be surprised if UOB removes Lady as an eligible card for One account since it's currently the only miles card for One account's spend criterion.,btohqsg
So i topped up more to get the max MAB,btohqsg
yeah but only need to empty UOB one mah,btohqsg
Hahaha he say to get max MAB,btohqsg
well you cannot have your cake and eat it..should have planned for Wed and Thu withdrawal and pump up accordingly to still hit $100k ADB for entire month of March.,btohqsg
i still remember people who played RHB and HSBC EGA... always have to move out in $200k blocks days ahead of month end... i cannot remember liao.. was RHB $100k or $200k limit.. feels like eons ago,btohqsg
Hahaha we know how banks are infamous for stopping double dipping,btohqsg
it was S$200K  and then got one day RHB app went down,btohqsg
$200k la. If $100k u have to spend 10 days moving each month  the EIR will be quite diluted.,btohqsg
wah you have $1m ah.. so pro so whale so powerful so macho,btohqsg
how many credit card we can have in/personspore?,btohqsg
1 Jan 2023 - the day the RHB whales panic 🤣,btohqsg
I dont think there is a limit. At my peak i had 27,btohqsg
I will be worried abt late charges😂,btohqsg
No late charges if you set giro 🌚,btohqsg
y u need 27 cards? MS or high spending lol,btohqsg
anyone here have successfully waive annual fees for uob evol (when you didn't do 3 transactions a month) ? I want to get back to using this card but annual fee coming in May,btohqsg
My view is we should keep 100k in UOB one account since the bonus interest does not apply above 100k. Unless we also want to use UOB one account as a holding account to to buy into FD  SSB or T-bills. In that case  I rather have another account like Trust to earn the 3% when the money is not being used. The trust account will be used as emergency fund or war chest.,btohqsg
One Account not ideal as a transactional account given that $100k MAB is the sweet spot for 5% EIR.,btohqsg
How do you know uob will bill you annual fee?,btohqsg
I don’t  but I am expecting the fee to be charged to credit card when the time comes?I didn’t fulfil the auto waiver criteria (3 transactions a month),btohqsg
have you heard of cashier's order? clear t+1,btohqsg
Young and ignorant. Was earning 30k a month when i was 23 years old and just sign up all cards that have promotion gettint multiple free suitcases like a dumbass,btohqsg
depending on the receiving bank  you might end up losing 1 day of interestalso may need to pay for the cashier order  and go bank branch physically  not to mention need to answer questions / checks on size,btohqsg

Hi  if I am new to Citibank and have no credit cards and I apply for citi premier miles card on moneysmart promotion (for the 5100 points to redeem iPad)  does that mean I will not get the 8 000 or 30 000 miles welcome bonus from Citibank because I didn’t apply directly on Citibank website?,btohqsg
can I check for AIA recurring creditcard payment  does it count for the OCBC 360 $500 spend bonus interest? read the TNCs  but kinda confusingi saw someone mentioned above that insurance recurring payment is eligible for UOB One min. spend  but not sure for OCBC,btohqsg
If it explicitly states that it's excluded then it's excluded. Else safe to say it's not. Maybe check the tnc again under cc spend bonus interest.,btohqsg
UOB one account has additional explicit term that allow recurring insurance to count for interest. despite that it would not be considered eligible transaction in CC. No such thing for OCBC (i thought insurance count and not really checking the bonus given  for years. Damn painful).,btohqsg
ahh i see  thanks for the valuable infoi shall park the recurring payment under UOB One CC instead then,btohqsg

hi i was reading on redeeming krisflyer miles and saw the t&c that if the sq flight does not have premium economy  it would be an economy seat. to prevent wastage of miles  does anyone know how to verify the flight you going to book for with miles has premium economy or not?,btohqsg
When u redeem u will select the available class,btohqsg
"i do see here the option to click. so then it means confirm have right? bcos i was confused why the t&c said 'if no premium economy  your seat booked would be economy""",btohqsg
Maybe in the event they change plane,btohqsg
does that mean SQ can easily change planes which doesnt have your seat type and then too bad you have to just 'waste' your miles?,btohqsg
Why not? Some people have suites  then got changed to first class,btohqsg
Hi  guys quick question:If I am new to Citibank and have no credit cards and I applied for citi premier miles card on moneysmart promotion (for the 5100 points)  does that mean I will not get the 8 000 or 30 000 miles welcome bonus from Citibank because I didn’t apply directly on Citibank website? Or is that included as well,btohqsg
"You can do a quick search in this group chat for ""travel insurance"". There are recent discussions on this",btohqsg
It depends on the plane. Not all planes have premium economy. B787 and B737 do not have,btohqsg
Hello everyone  i have a question in regards to both CPM and CRMC! In regards to paying for credit card bills  do they send you a hard copy letter/have a message sent to pre-empt you for your bills or do you have to track manually yourself?,btohqsg
Can only get the first offer that you applied. Doesn't stack unless stated otherwise,btohqsg
Hi  I just saw that citi thankyou reward will be discontinued   what does this means if I were to continue earn points? Is there anywhere I can still convert to miles?,btohqsg
Thanks! Should have applied directly on Citibank….,btohqsg
Wow this just happened:SQ636 tonight equipment change from B77W to A359MH (9V-SHO). F & PY downgraded  J become regional seat.,btohqsg
Oh wow… how do yall prevent this kind of thing from happening before redeeming miles for a flight? Or can’t at all,btohqsg
I think is just bad luck. Hasn’t happened to me before but my guess is they should offer compensation if it happens.,btohqsg
Hi guys... jus wondering if you can advise... i m trying to clock my $500 spendings for this mth and i made payment on 26th and 27th... do u think uob will process it and track in under Mar spendings?,btohqsg

My experience in Japan is... wireless payment is not prevalent. better to bring card with chip and insert,btohqsg
I intend to bring Youtrip physical card. so insert card and key in 4 digits?,btohqsg
dont think need to enter 4 digit for payment.,btohqsg

Sorry for the dumb question but is Fast payment same as paylah?,btohqsg
No. FAST payment and PayLah are different,btohqsg
You can search in the group chat how they do it,btohqsg
Why Uob allow personal AC to transfer like that?,btohqsg

Why is trazora so patient and nice?,btohqsg
because he is patient and nice. lol,btohqsg

HDB BTO vs Resale: What property to buy as a First-Time Home Buyer?https://youtu.be/oIAb4x2_644,btohqsg
For this.. the earmarked amount can still earn the 5% interest right.. what if we accidentally withdraw till less than 100k?,btohqsg
Yes. Once earmarked your money cannot be touched,btohqsg
Ohh.. so there's a failsafe.. which is also good to ensure my 100k can still earn the 5% interest haha,btohqsg
I also saw this yesterday but no listing of any new t&c.. hope it's not the giro..,btohqsg
If you withdraw fall below $100k before it is earmarked  earmark will be failed. Once it is earmarked  your money $100k will “disappear virtually” from your account. You can’t withdraw it at all unless calling CSO.,btohqsg
"Oh wow.. so the 100k ""disappear virtually"" but still can earn the 5% interest? That will look so weird",btohqsg
can call CSO to help release meh?,btohqsg
CSO will tell you the consequences if you insist to withdraw it.Similar to you book HDB  can you cancel it before TOP? Of course yes  HDB will tell you the consequences.,btohqsg
Earmarked for 4 months  that why you can’t take part in the consecutive promotions.,btohqsg
Ohhh.. cos the money will reappear only after next promo started ?,btohqsg
Sure  they just take back the cash credit lo,btohqsg
They may claw back the bonus since you don’t fulfill the criteria anymore after withdrawal,btohqsg
By the time the earmark end  the next promo already started if any,btohqsg
Means the account should show as $0 when earmarked? I submitted the participation form but still see 100k. Unless i did it wrongly,btohqsg
The 100k is still there but it is gray out and you can’t touch if earmarked,btohqsg
Will receive this email immediately upon submission of participation form?,btohqsg
Good night all.Permission to join Webull Singapore  how do you do it  friends?,btohqsg
I put more than 100k so that MAB is 100k (cos i opened on the 5th of the month). But the funds not greyed,btohqsg
So it seems it is not earmarked yet. You may want to call UOB to clarify,btohqsg
If u opened 5th March. Earmark by 30 Apr.,btohqsg
The promo do not use MAB. Was your account $0 at 30 Dec 1030pm?,btohqsg
opened a new uob one acc in March. Considered $0 right?,btohqsg
Do you register for the promotion?,btohqsg
Yup sorry missed that part. Make sure you keep 100k until 30 Apr. Did you receive the registration email?,btohqsg
Then keep 100k throughout Apr you'll receive the cash credit by 30 Apr. Avoid withdrawing below 100k until then.,btohqsg
So if you do register and your activities in Mar  according the screenshot above  it will be earmarked in 30-Apr,btohqsg
Hi  May I ask which credit card is good for insurance investment rewards/ cashback?I’m paying like $300 / month.,btohqsg
If only $300/mth can look at Maybank Platinum Visa. $300/mth for consecutive 3 months gets you a total of $30 cashback. Seehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183637,btohqsg
I’m currently using uob one credit card. Does this payment of $300 count into my min monthly use of $500/$600?,btohqsg
Count to spend criteria for bonus interest for the UOB One accountONLY.,btohqsg
not counted for uob card rebate/points  count to uob one account $500 card spend for bonus interest,btohqsg
insurance only can count to max 50% of the spending requirement.,btohqsg
Oh yes that's true.@WillyTan21can use CardUp to clock it I guess. Especially if it's an insurance company that don't support Visa recurring payments.,btohqsg
What happen to mari vest 3.23%?😡,btohqsg
Hi what would be the best credit card for wedding expenses?,btohqsg
"You can search the chat for ""credit card wedding""",btohqsg
Hi everyone. May I am abit confused on how the mcc will affect 1) uob one acct's spending criteria and 2) the rebate from quarter spending?Any common misconception i need to look out for? Is there any place i can confirm that the criterias are met for each?,btohqsg
You can confirm by looking at the t&c for both UOB One account and UOB One card. Useheymax.aito check MCC.,btohqsg
Hi for HSBC rev 500min spend does it have to be under the qualifying MCC spend? Or any online/contactless payment would fulfill?,btohqsg
1. Uob one account spend criteria has a counter we can check in the app. Has anyone encountered that it says completed but later on got rejected because there were exclusion?2. For Uob One credit card rebate spending criteria  i cant seem to find any place to check? Do you guys just keep tracking the excluded mcc and spend accordingly?,btohqsg
The spend tracker on UOB TMRW is pretty accurate. But I still trust myself more so I keep track of every transaction I made  even whether it's posted or not. You can search the chat for data points where UOB TMRW have missing transactions at times.,btohqsg
Hi. Does anyone happen to know the MCC for paying rental and which card would be the best? Thank!,btohqsg
Great YouTube video with JJ Ong,btohqsg
when I typed rent it only shows rental for cars though  curious to know on paying rental for my monthly rent,btohqsg
Maybe search for the company you're renting from? As long it's a local company and supports credit card payments  it should be there.,btohqsg
Mmf rate now below tbill.Fullerton sgd is 3.6%🙈Mari invest 3.23%🙈Tbill better 3.8%😤,btohqsg
I think you need to specify what you consider “the best”. Each person may have different goals for their best card (ie. provides insurance/interest free payments etc) so good to list yours.,btohqsg
based on recommendations is fine  but understand where you are coming from thanks,btohqsg
It's non-local thats why  does anyone happen to know any local housing rental companies in sg? Maybe I can use that as reference is fine.,btohqsg
Maybe you can use amaze + empty wallet to check the MCC? Since it's non local  you might want to use amaze to avoid the 3.25% fx charge by banks anyway.,btohqsg
can also use heymax to search for mcc of overseas merchant  just need to choose the country when doing the search,btohqsg
Can I check if I want to maximise ONE UOB return  I have to spend min sgd 500 for credit card and credit the salary monthly  can I check whether there is a way for me to credit my salary in myself?,btohqsg

anyone received the interest for Dec to Jan HSBC cycle (don't need sms to apply)?,btohqsg

There is a famous JIT master and I sure won’t want to be like him. And always ask people how ah how ah. Can i still make it. Or will miss or not,btohqsg
there will always be People who procastinated till the 11th hour..haha,btohqsg
If you and your family members travel very frequently  best card I can think of is HSBC Visa Infinite card. That's because BOTH principal cardmember and sub card holders have unlimited lounge access under Lounge Key program. But this card doesn't allow AF waiver I think. So you need to travel frequently to make it worth the value,btohqsg
You can find out which lounge or restaurants participating under this Lounge Key program. Sometimes I will even purposely go to another terminal after landed in Singapore to eat at a restaurant that I know is nice using free lounge pass.,btohqsg
First time doing this uob promo thing  so basically transfer 100k out by today and on the 1st April   apply for the promo and transfer back into the uob one account correct?,btohqsg
Must see the Tnc when announced.And also not sure today what’s the cut off timing that will be used.,btohqsg
I guess they want to save as much on the daily interest,btohqsg
Extra days of high interest gone that’s why need to take some risk to do it today,btohqsg
If empty the uob one  will we still get the prorated March interest?,btohqsg
Nope. If u do high level method. Won’t affect at all.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/182078,btohqsg
It doesn't matter. If you planned early and have 115k for 27 days  you'll still get $4.25ish base interest. Your MAB is still at least 100k to get a total of 4.99% EIR.If you really want to min-max  then keep in 114815 till 27 Mar. You'll get the 5% EIR.,btohqsg
Living life on the edge 😄,btohqsg
So far  those who have done before。what interest did you get in that month when you empty the $100k for that few days,btohqsg
Would it make sense to get some longer term US treasury bonds? Quite good price now,btohqsg
I heard he kenna a few times. Always ask people how come they get the reward he never get. lol.People say him many time he still don’t change. They gave up.,btohqsg
The max 5% pa on $100k adb. Because we use excel calculate adb to ensure $100k after factoring in days at $10.,btohqsg
Anyway now too late to do anything … just wait for the promo to surface and throw 100k back in,btohqsg
Also have rumours (I am unaware) that Uob one will be cutting rates.So if locking in for 4.5 months be prepared.,btohqsg
Yes confirmed cutting rates from 1 MAY,btohqsg
If you planned forward (keep MAB at least 100k) then 4.99%-5% p.a.If not  it will be 4.9% p.a.ish depending on how long it's emptied (MAB becomes 85k-95kish).,btohqsg
Really can’t share much but if u trust me the cut will be from 1 MAY,btohqsg
Means no more 5% EIR? Sob,btohqsg
Good things really don't last forever. I'm glad I enjoyed it for 6 months at least,btohqsg
High interest will still be there but there will be a cut,btohqsg
It's bound to happen  not if just when lol,btohqsg
Cut a bit still ok. Still better then DBS Multiplier,btohqsg
Confirmed 1 May . So enjoy one more mth,btohqsg
Hopefully no change to the criteria.,btohqsg
Saw someone post in another chat grp down to effective 4% for 150k,btohqsg
Link please? I’m sure Chris won’t mind if sharing info not referral,btohqsg
Kekeke glad that he share first. And yes it’s true,btohqsg
So if earmark $100k must pump in another $50k?,btohqsg
It is on the chat group that you exited earlier.,btohqsg
No link. Some one just posted : Note that uob one account interest will be revised to max effective 4% for $150k wef 1 May,btohqsg
It is posted by individuals. Unverified. Not from bank announcements.,btohqsg
Only $150 insurance counted and $150 must spend on retails.,btohqsg
Regarding UOB Dragon deposit promotion  for whatever reasons  despite me doing everything right  somehow UOB didn't earmark my deposit and gave me extra interest. What I did is to withdraw my deposit on last BUSINESS day of December. Then on 1st day of promo release  I registered for the promotion. Then transferred MORE than 100k back into UOB ONE.Come early Feb  fund still not earmarked although some folks here said theirs already earmarked. So I waited 1 more week and registered again  hoping it'll earmark in March. Didn't happen.,btohqsg
Hi guys  can confirm if Prudential insurance counted in UOB $500 spending for one account?,btohqsg
I'm assuming you transferred out to another bank before 30 Dec 1030pm?,btohqsg
Thanks  then I should spit it into monthly 😂,btohqsg
Go n read your Dec 2023 UOB One account statement inPDF copy.Check what was your account closing balance in December 2023?,btohqsg
After u registered and moved in $100k. Did your balance ever drop below $100k on any day,btohqsg
Like that then maybe not worth to put in UOB already. Might as well put in Tbills if not going to spend $500 per month,btohqsg
And I thought register in January. Earmark happens end Feb?,btohqsg
When using grab pay later installment do cards still respective cardsEarn points/miles for that MCC,btohqsg
Have you used Grab pay later already?,btohqsg
Depends on earmark promo to boost up the effective rate,btohqsg
no need recurring  direct pay via pru ipay also can,btohqsg
Well everyone nerf. Uob 4% + earmark could still be competitive,btohqsg
Anyway just like Cashback vs miles game.Just go for which ever is most value for money. No need loyalty.,btohqsg
I called the bank and said must be recurring insurance payment,btohqsg
then the bank giving false info not supported by their TnC,btohqsg
Some bank doesn’t even fully understand their product la,btohqsg
Yes  if I know early will have this promo  I sure will fund in more to do this  because I have the excel sheet for the MAB. 😁,btohqsg
So currently it deducted from your bank account directly or your Grab pay credit card?,btohqsg
T&C does say “insurance payments made on a recurring basis”https://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/save/chequeing/one-account/uob-one-account-card-spend.pdf,btohqsg
Oh  I don’t top up via cash or bank. Intending to use on Compasia for gadget purchase using either hsbc revo/crmc-amaze or dbsww,btohqsg
Why u never share your golden Info on Uob one here. Sad.,btohqsg
not much ba? play safe better..lol,btohqsg
see the TnC. Anyway tried and tested direct payment of insurance counted to the $500 card spend for bonus interest.,btohqsg
Bank can anytime void what u did if they want to use the term and conditions.If any dispute in future  they will use this term and condition to void the interests. Just saying and play safe.,btohqsg
void using which clause in the TnC? read the TnC not FAQ,btohqsg
You will only know after the promo start.,btohqsg
Something is wrong. Your 10th is different from 9th. But then again double check against your bank account transaction will be more accurate than me,btohqsg
The system is setup that CC payments for Grab PayLater is via Grab Wallet auto top-up first. So there's only 1 card gets rewards  at 0.3% cashback.,btohqsg
Iirc recurring payments via ipay is considered recurring.,btohqsg
Coz got giro ma no meh?,btohqsg
Yes which I did it.One off payment using credit card don't consider recurring payment.,btohqsg
hey guys  does giro transaction count towards the uob min $500 monthly spend?,btohqsg
To be clear  what u mean by giro? recurrent payment via cc?,btohqsg
GIRO is specifically processed only weekdays  before 6pm. Impossible for it to be processed on Saturdays  less to say Sunday.Payment is usually +1 business day after processing date.,btohqsg

Visa and master might have different mcc for the same merchant.,btohqsg
So I need to test the mcc out for both visa and MasterCard? Or will heymax be able to distinguish them?,btohqsg
no problem. just ensure you also read the amaze charges tnc (e.g.  additional charges on some mcc)  as well as your Citi Rewards Card tnc,btohqsg
any credit card has synergy with youtrip?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows when will Maybank Treats points be credited after transaction has been posted? Thanks,btohqsg
DBS cards will at least count as minimum spending  just no rewards. Check t&c to be sure.,btohqsg

Yes  just join for 1 month,btohqsg
We all forgot how low bank interest rates were last time. 0.5-1%. We all enjoyed 4-5% pa interest rates for a few years but it’s all going to end soon.,btohqsg
yeap recurrent payment like paying insurance,btohqsg
Just like the winds of change  now with interest rate lowering  turn to other forms of passive income like bank and reits stock.,btohqsg
eligible if charged to eligible uob cc/dc and mcc is not excluded. insurance not excluded from card spend for bonus interest,btohqsg
Hihi  does anyone knows  For the 2Q rising dragon promo (if there is one)  is the incremental deposits referenced to 31 mar although it is a Sunday?,btohqsg

Don’t think so  - MCC is 6540 (Prepaid wallets),btohqsg
Nobody will know until 1st April when formally announced.Safer to bet it could be any date from 28th March onwards correct?,btohqsg
usually the case  need to empty today before 10.30pm as transaction after that will only be reflected on 1 Apr,btohqsg
can I ask if empty today  will it affect any interest earned for this month? curious to know if it is worth it or not,btohqsg
affect monthly average balance  affect interest slightly if momthly average balance is below $100k,btohqsg
this means cant earn interest for the month of march?,btohqsg
Means you don’t get the full 5%,btohqsg

hi  anyone has any credit card recommendations ??imma fresh grad with an existing UOB one,btohqsg
Depends on your spending. Pick something that can contribute to your spending for UOB one account. Check out t&c for the list of cards eligible.,btohqsg
Uob evol is easier to use for fresh gradUnless u pay bills/petrol/groceries then uob one is better,btohqsg
Hi can I ask where we can check how much cashback we have been getting in the UOB One credit card? Thank you!,btohqsg

UOB Absolute don't contribute to spend. Remember to check the t&cs.,btohqsg
To track  use Excel or Sheets.To check  quarterly login to UOB TMRW to see  provided you're eligible to get,btohqsg
Yes  I'm pretty sure i did that,btohqsg
What does your UOB One account's PDF statement say for Dec 23?,btohqsg

Jan 24 statement  also more than 100k throughout.,btohqsg
I supposed you also received the registration email.. and you didn't go below 100003.83 at any point of time from 31 Jan onwards?,btohqsg
Register in January. Earmark only happens end Feb.,btohqsg
Ya.. so usually from 31 Jan till earmark should not fall below 100k + 31 Dec balance ma.,btohqsg
OP said early Feb no reaction then he go register again,btohqsg
Haha maybe because he Feb registered again then UOB erased his Jan registration? 🤷🏻‍♂️I remembered they said don't send multiple registrations.,btohqsg
Based on last action.  Deposit date or form submission date. Whichever later,btohqsg
Just in case  I didn't put enough money to my UOB acc to be earmarked and received this sms message. I put more money and it got earmarked in a week. I think you should call UOB customer serviceDear customer  we note that your account registered in the UOB Rising Dragon Savings Promotion has not been funded with the participating deposit amount stated in your registration form.

U submit in feb. Earmark becomes end March,btohqsg
@YSLee_sgdid you receive this SMS? I suspect you keep on submit new registration and it got overwritten lol,btohqsg
Did your daily balance fall below $100 003.83 inany dayin Mar 2024?  Do you have any GIRO deduction from your UOB One account in Mar?,btohqsg
Oh  I just checked. For a few days in mid Feb  the balance was 100k exact . So if this is the cause  then i should have kept min 100 003.83. funny thing is then I top up to above that amount but maybe too late,btohqsg
Thanks. But I didn't receive this SMS,btohqsg
uob absolute cannot contribute to interest tracker,btohqsg
You have 2 choices:1. Transfer inNOW(I just checked  still today's date) to make your account exactly 100003.83  keep until earmark happens  do not withdraw anything even if the interest comes in (to be safe). Register for March participation periodNOW(today last day)  do not re-register anymore  check for registration email.2. Transfer out everything to another bankNOW  and hope that they announce the next promo on Monday.,btohqsg
Thanks. I will go for option 2 since i had already emptied it on Thu. It's ok  just forgo the dragon promo. Appreciate all your help👍,btohqsg
Just don't touch the monies after you transfer in. If you're going for this promo  your UOB One shouldn't be your primary account for any funds transfers anyway.,btohqsg
Another example of just in time or touching the account after registering. That messes up the promo.Just play safe. And everything will be ok.Step 1 - make sure account only has $10 ideally 1-2 days before end of the monthStep 2 - register for the promo the moment it is announcedStep 3 - move in $100 000.00 immediately after registering. Don’t even touch the original $10 and any base or bonus interest. So u have 100 010.00 + any interest credited.Step 4 - do not touch the account. Don’t move in or out any single dollar until earmarked happens.If u follow the above. Everything will be fine. Don’t go and last minute or disturb the account.,btohqsg
I know some go and withdraw the bonus interest until account has exactly $100 000.00. So earmark will fail. Since you don’t have 31 Dec + 100 000.00,btohqsg
Why would putting extactly $100k fail the earmark ?,btohqsg
Because 31 Dec day end would be $10 + base interest say $4.You need to have at least $100 014 at all times until earmark happens.Also do not forget. Earmark happens 1 month and 3 weeks+ after you register.Register on 1st jan. earmark is about 20th Feb. (Plus minus),btohqsg
Simple rule is to check dec statement  check the 31st dec end balance  lets say $x  ensure after u register that time  until your amount get earmarked and until after earmark period ends  never ever allow the balance to fall below $x + $100k.,btohqsg
Abit late to say this now though..  but anyway will serve as a lesson learnt for the next 1st April's promo  if there is one,btohqsg
I always have buffer for everything I do. Time and amount.,btohqsg
Then when can remove the base interest and one account interest?,btohqsg
After u see your balance  magically dropped 100k.,btohqsg
Actually it should be safe to withdraw exactly the bonus interest right?,btohqsg
Suppose if 31 Dec balance is already base 100k  can add 100k (for earmarking) now and come mid Apr then withdraw the 100k base ?.,btohqsg
Depends on how confident u are and how closely u track your account.If prone to make mistakes I would recommend only touch it when u see earmark already completed.Why risk the earmark process just because of $400 not earning any interest.For me personally I remove till $100 100.00. But later someone is going ask me why $100 100 and not $100 050.,btohqsg
Last call for transferring out. As of 10:15pm  FAST transfer still cleared today.,btohqsg
Base interest I suggest don't touch  bonus interest comes in after they take the amount  can use it as part of the 100k.,btohqsg
But even so  after withdraw already  u still need to make sure the earmark amount is above the 31st dec end balance + 100k,btohqsg
