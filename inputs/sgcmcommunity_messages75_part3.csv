at 10 years old  the car paper value with fresh 10 year COE was 30kNow at 14 years old  you bought it for 65-70k,btohqsg
25k coe with 5k rebate of ARF,btohqsg
u try to sell now at arnd 50k,btohqsg
Oh yes  this car damn rare tbh. But just trying to give our friend here an idea of what to expect-R,btohqsg
50k is already a very optimistic price if u ask me,btohqsg
its a korean car with a american badge.,btohqsg
Cuz my friend say this car is rare and he suggest me to buy this car so I brought it but end up I can't afford,btohqsg
Where is that friend now? Ask him for help,btohqsg
But got two types of rare,btohqsg
Another one is collecter’s car like that,btohqsg
I ask him alr he say he can't help,btohqsg
Cherry qq also now considered rare,btohqsg
yeah haha cannot blindly follow sometimes,btohqsg
I think the best is follow some of the bros said. Do the lala or what to cover. That’s your only hope.,btohqsg
buang one time lorry see queen elizabeth waving at u,btohqsg
But just a personal advice from me  if you are a point A to B commuter  just go for the most common cars you see on our road - there’s a reason why they are everywhere (Eg. Economical  reliability)-R,btohqsg
I completely agree with Imran and suggest you do this,btohqsg
Rare cars arent good if u dont have deep pockets. but we can discuss abt that next time,btohqsg
we try to solve the problem at hand,btohqsg
Yea. Now just go sign up those apps n start picking jobs,btohqsg
Solve the short term problm first,btohqsg
My full time job is delivery attendants night shift,btohqsg
So basically afternoon about 3 pm start work then until early morning then end,btohqsg
if u can do with less rest and downtime  lalamove in the day is viable!,btohqsg
Okay any possibility u can try to squeeze a part time job in?,btohqsg
its only a temporary thing so u can pay this few months worth of installment,btohqsg
but take care of yourself too please hahaha,btohqsg
I had try to squeeze a part time job but end up not enough sleep then tht day while I driving my company lorry then I hit a car on road,btohqsg
@xhao_xzxYes  can try this ^Unless you really cannot dong the loan anymore and need let the car go ASAP then just pay $10 go Quotz and get an actual offer and then sell your car thru them,btohqsg
Cut down your expenses also can help,btohqsg
I staying with my mother in a rental HDB house,btohqsg
I had cut down a lot alr,btohqsg
sorry bro which one is your car,btohqsg
The black Chevrolet aveo5 at sgcarmart,btohqsg
She old alr then her pay not high also,btohqsg
How much you earning? Roughly  no need give exact,btohqsg
What expenses you have right now?,btohqsg
Yes but sometimes after cpf I get back around 1.6 only,btohqsg
really hard sell  sorry to hear that bro,btohqsg
Bills and rental fee the car loan and the petrol,btohqsg
ur workplace accessible by bus or train?,btohqsg
maybe can cut down abit on petrol if take bus ah,btohqsg
not convenient definitely but i think it might save some $,btohqsg
Bro if cpf is none of your concern,btohqsg
Quit your job and do lalamove full time or grab,btohqsg
Honestly you can earn more if you work hard,btohqsg
And slowly pay off for the car while waiting to sell and get the liability off,btohqsg
A car in sg will always be a liability. If you really need to let it go urgently  you can try to lower the asking amount and just see what you can get back but that also means you’ll need to tank whatever losses there is,btohqsg
But can't really get what people say 6-7k per month,btohqsg
3-4k very gd n decent alrdy,btohqsg
