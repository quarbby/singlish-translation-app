Any cards that you pay off with HSBC EGA GIRO  doesn't matter,btohqsg
I have my Amaze linked with the new Mari card for now  waiting for my upcoming YouTube premium plan renewal to see if have cashback or not. If not  I will stick with my SCB linked to Amaze  that one still have,btohqsg
Take note it is 4% EIR for 150k.,btohqsg
I think will still have since YouTube MCC is not excluded.,btohqsg
It says all your activities are done  so you have hit Level 2. And I think you meant 4%* p.a. at 150k.,btohqsg
My worry is if Mari Bank excludes any AMAZE*transactions. For example  CIMB and DCS won‚Äôt count any purchases made by Amaze-linked cards,btohqsg
I checked  and nothing there. But CIMB also never put in T&C  but still exclude Amaze‚Ä¶,btohqsg
If I just got my uob privi miles Master card in Feb. I already received all the bonus sign up miles. If I cancel now. Only used 6months.Will there be any penalty or anything from uob.Cos I didn't realise at tat point tat Visa much lower fees for Card up. So i wanna apply for uob privi miles Visa.Any1 can advice? Thank u in advance.,btohqsg
Bro Oxy  you are very knowledgeable and I‚Äôm quite new to this game so I want to ask you.For amaze paired with Citi rewards used to pay Spotify defined in SGD  got earn insta points or not?,btohqsg
Just keep the card until annual fees come then cancel it. Since you will be holding the visa version  does not count as cooldown to welcome gifts.,btohqsg
I also new haha  all learning. For Spotify  there should be no insta points unless they are charging you USD for some reason.In Amaze  only non-SGD transactions are rewarded with insta points.In my case  I only use Amaze for two things:1. For SGD transactions but processed overseas (Spotify  Apple  Netflix  etc.). Benefit is that it saves on that 1% DCC2. As an emergency FCY card while travelling. Their rate sucks even after taking into account the linked credit card cashback and insta points  but better than nothing when your Youtrip or whatever not enough money or cannot work for some reason,btohqsg
Speaking of annual fees  anyone else feel like standard chartered recently super stingy with their fee waivers? I thought I was the only one,btohqsg
Just a heads up in case your Netflix is still charged from outside SG. You can write to them to get them to charge you from SG.,btohqsg
Ah  paiseh didn‚Äôt know they changed. I alr stopped with Netflix a few months back üòÖ,btohqsg
The older/oldest(?) accounts still charge from outside SG. My friend started a new account and found that they charge from SG now and I wrote to request to be charged from SG.,btohqsg
Ohhh  either ways not going back to Netflix now. My household is split between two houses  and their new rules are too annoying,btohqsg
Should be fine then.For CIMB World Mastercard  as long the MCC is eligible  will not be excluded. Their promos (with or without Singsaver) usually states clearly in t&c that they exclude Amaze transactions.,btohqsg
Hais  poor Amaze. Last time was like such a free lunch,btohqsg
No point to use Amaze  just pay directly to Spotify.,btohqsg
"Think the concern is if recurring  will count as ""online"" or not",btohqsg
Will. Tested already.So far I tested:Spotify  GOMO  Netflix  ZYM Mobile  ViewQwest. Amazon Prime is likely to be Online even recurring.,btohqsg
Gamxia  i also wondering actually üòÇ,btohqsg
I tried on SCB Smart and HSBC Live+ both kena DCC. Very annoying. I can use Amex but the Cashback 1.7% might as well 4mpd.,btohqsg
I'm not really looking at any welcome gifts. Or sign up bonus.Just wanna get the uob privi Visa version.So tat I can get 1.4mpd for all my recurring card up payments.  With a lower fee paid to Card up.Tks for the advice! üòäüëç,btohqsg
They always stingy. Same as OCBC.,btohqsg
Ah? I could have sworn no have. I just googled and checked  still cannot see any Amaze exclusions. But while checking  I actually saw that Mari Bank explicitly excludes ALL Amaze transactions. Idk whether I blind from sleepiness the last time I read it or they just updated. Either ways  I have my answer for Mari Bank,btohqsg
That's very weird. I never gotten DCC from Spotify transactions before. How much were you charged in total?,btohqsg
I dl the tnc on 30 May 2024 and it is written exclude amaze,btohqsg
Are you talking about CIMB or Mari Bank? If Mari Bank yeah probably my eye cock,btohqsg
Should be fine since it says completed. Can see Friday you receive the bonus interest anot,btohqsg
Sorry Salah parking mixed up with Spotify. Netflix was a long time ago and about 1% extra.,btohqsg
Yeah that one my eye cock up. But CIMB  tough tough. Anyways with the rise of zero annual fee cards  I can finally drop my SCB,btohqsg
Haha I just reread you typed Spotify previously. So is it Netflix or Spotify? ü§£ I didn't get charged DCC for either.,btohqsg
Hi All  for DBS Altitude Card -Trip.comand Atome can be counted as qualifying spend ?,btohqsg
Spotify I still am getting DCC as recent as half a year ago with SCB  1%. Stopped after I switch to link with Amaze. Netflix also  but maybe because I am on the OG account,btohqsg
Spotify still gets DCC charges. Netflix used to but now can get moved to be charged from SG.If you use Amex or Trust  no DCC but the rewards are terrible so I rather 4mpd on Citi Rewards Amaze.,btohqsg
Back when it was $9.90/month. They charge $10 to my DCC charging cards like grab pay and SCB,btohqsg
Biggest scam sia. SGD  SGD. Still kena charge 1% for no reason,btohqsg
Amaze FX rates sucks. But when it comes to cases like this where the source currency alr SGD and as long as the credit card linked never exclude Amaze transactions from cashback  it‚Äôs the most worth I think,btohqsg
Ok I remember why I was never charged DCC... I paid through Singtel Music  like their 12 month subscription (3 months 30% off or something).. so got no DCC  cheaper rates and free unlimited data streaming from Spotify.. üòÖüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Got at least 2 card that works  last I heard.,btohqsg
Ah ya  because SingTel is the one processing payment. Spotify processes SGD transactions in Sweden lol,btohqsg
Last time (idk if now still have  left long time ago)  there was a big hooha after the wire card fiasco where CDC changed to some Hong Kong payment processor  then suddenly everything got 1% fee when buying things in SG,btohqsg
Yeah correct. All the while I paid Singtel for Spotify  so I still get full cashback also. But now that I jumped out of Singtel  I stopped using Spotify also.,btohqsg
We are the banks greatest enemy ü•≤,btohqsg
Banks are bleeding ü©∏ from all the churning of miles.,btohqsg
Ah  what are you using instead now? Apple Music? They also charge the 1% if not through Amaze or cards like that. (Yes I stupid  I subscribe to Apple Music  Spotify  and YouTube Premium concurrently),btohqsg
I listen to YouTube ad-free... By not using the standard YouTube app üëÄ,btohqsg
on what basis are you making this assertion that Amaze FX rates suck?,btohqsg
I used to also  but annoying that watch time doesn‚Äôt seem to be synced. And my tv no have alternate apps. I know got other ways like installing a DNS Adblock  but whatever la just gave in,btohqsg
