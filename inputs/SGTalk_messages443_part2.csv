I gout so much that my right ankle got a lump. The doctor said itâ€™s the deposits from uric acid,btohqsg
So thereâ€™s this permanent lump where the Ankle bone is lol.,btohqsg
Ya. Itâ€™s like stalactite come from constant calcium deposit. I built one with acid crystals. Scary,btohqsg
Now my left ankle got a swollen lump.But not due to gout,btohqsg

Lucky thunder tea rice taste like a grass patch after the rain. So it doesnâ€™t affect me,btohqsg
So much triggerMight as well ask what doesnâ€™t trigger lol,btohqsg
It differs person to person. When u go test  they have some number rating. I trigger very often. Like almost once a month,btohqsg
Dehydration also can trigger gout. Which is usually my downfall. Never drink enough water,btohqsg
