Bro  to clarify. I go to that website  I applied many jobs  got 3 interviews. 2 are for SGUP and I moved on to 2nd round of interview. At this time  I got the offer to work as full time not under SGUP where my take home is about $3800 after CPF. So yeah  I got a good offer even as a non degree. So I rejected the SGUP program. But for you  it can be a really good deal.So let's appreciate our government ok? 😂,btohqsg
