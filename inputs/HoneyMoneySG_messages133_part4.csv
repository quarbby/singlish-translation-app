What  credit cards to use for paying travel agencies eg chan brothers?,btohqsg
depends on amount. UOB KF via Kris+ is an option,btohqsg
gd point  didn't realize Chan Bros is a Kris+ merchant,btohqsg
be careful.. mcc on Kris+ is 7991 (Tourist Attraction)..not under UOB Lady Travel category.,btohqsg
Chan bro can spilt payment upon request de,btohqsg
yup they are quite understanding.. even my downpayment i split into multiple cards,btohqsg
Anyone know if e-giro for HSBC also entitled to 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Looks like UoB KF does not support Apple Watch,btohqsg
But don‚Äôt see any articles say UoB KF does not support Apple Watch,btohqsg
I'm sure it does. I'm using on my watch to pay mrt rides,btohqsg
we are able to open an account online  is that correct? eGiro/Giro just have to download forms and what not and do we have to submit them physically?,btohqsg
Giro needs to send physical form to cc banks  not HSBC bank. And you need to go down to HSBC to register signature for giro to work.,btohqsg
Ya must head down to hsbc bank to register signature. Previously my giro rejected cos no signature. And u need to bring physical nric if not can't register signature. They don't accept Singpass one.,btohqsg
Hi new to this!Can I check if OCBC / UOB savings account condition can still be fulfilled thru paynow for self employee? üôèüèº,btohqsg
Uob one u can do the dbs ibanking transfer  purpose set to salary crediting.Ocbc I am not sure.,btohqsg
I see! Okay thank you üôèüèº,btohqsg
so it's actually best to visit a branch to open an account and 'set up' the signature to enable giro?,btohqsg
is anyone using SC Smart Credit Card? applied and got the card approved yesterday. im able to use the digital one on my phone but adding the card to my family member's phone and using it doesn't work. also  online txn on amazon got declined too. any reason why? does the digital card only allow 1 device?,btohqsg
will need to take time to queue though. What i did was to open account online and went there just to update signature. Faster.,btohqsg
ah! thanks Anthony! will do just that,btohqsg
Hi all  may I know how do I purchase item from apple instore using crmc? Can I use apple pay or must use with amaze card?,btohqsg
Amaze card. In fact remove CRMC from your Apple Pay lol,btohqsg
When u guys like buying a big item purchase like laptop do u guys go sign up 1 new credit card for promotion and buy the item then stop using the card and 1 year later cancel?,btohqsg
i won't..i will find the appropriate credit card that I have that can cater for such purchases.Often  I find maintaining a long relationship with a bank has more benefits than churning apply and cancel.,btohqsg
I am not a big spender normally spend around 1k which is already on UOB one card for UOB one interest already,btohqsg
Plan to get a $0min spend require credit card and benefit it,btohqsg
I applied UOB VS to buy a phone at the shop. Won‚Äôt cancel as I use it for more than $1k but less than $2k purchase at brick & mortar shop,btohqsg
UOB VS is a very underrated card. It should deserve to be in everybody's backup arsenal.. and i believe if you use other UOB cards actively  you should have no issue getting UOB VS annual fee waived similarly too,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have much use for it except above $1k below $2k shop purchase as I use groceries with my lady solitaire  other stuff with PPV or KrisFlyer. Also got CRMC and WWMC to boot. üòÇ,btohqsg
UOB LS min income need $120k to apply -.-,btohqsg
I think I can‚Äôt get the promotion from moneysmart from UOB bank cos I am not a new card holder?I have UOB one credit card,btohqsg
Got people successfully approved for UOB lady sol with 100k ish annual income.,btohqsg
Sad My income not so high,btohqsg
Then slowly work ur way up then. üí™,btohqsg
Still new to credit card world tryigg no to get benefit from that only have a UOB one card for UOB one acc,btohqsg
I also have UOB one. I use it to pay utilities  grab  Macdonald and those UOB$ merchants which affected my other UOB mile cards to get min $500 for Cashback,btohqsg
I just review this videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NviJOmZZvf4&t=370sPlan to open HSBC account and use as GIRO for insurance and tax,btohqsg
Got any lower tier than UOB LS?,btohqsg
You conveniently skipped UOB lady card ü§£,btohqsg
UOB PPV? Since you have the UOB One for UOB One account interest,btohqsg
Easy 4mpd for $1010 max spending,btohqsg
this one is valid right and in this case we just need to set 1st month transfer to HSBC and the 2nd day we transfer out for our daily needs,btohqsg
I set recurring instructions. 1x 2k in to HSBC ega and 5 times of 400 out at the beginning of the month.,btohqsg
Hi@antonio191203Yeah I saw your comment earlierWhen do you start set to HSBC ?,btohqsg
I opened ega around august last year  tgt with my Revo.,btohqsg
I see the HSBC EGA benefit is more on giro only right so I will plan use it for my insurance and tax,btohqsg
Giro is 1 thing. HSBC ega interest for incremental fresh fund is also very good.https://youtu.be/lGvgw03KNxw,btohqsg
You can search the chat and you'll know the consensus of it.,btohqsg
Why 2nd day? Just withdraw after deposit.,btohqsg
oh on the same day is ok as well ?Sorry I am new so not to sure about it,btohqsg
