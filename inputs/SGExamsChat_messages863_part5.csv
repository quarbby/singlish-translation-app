If op dm second hand gc  I gonna recommend  and upvote the comment on carousel platform too.,btohqsg
otherwise can learn how to draw on Latex.,btohqsg
Yup thanks   I also think it is cute,btohqsg
Think the group has AI bots that detect for suspicious users who joined for spamming,btohqsg
omg i got hired by a political party to make graphics,btohqsg
ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥° im 16 can add to my eae portfolio,btohqsg
Think can uh if you pursuing a future career as graphic design,btohqsg
Ahh but you need qualifications in graphics design too I think,btohqsg
Should be Content and Advertising Spam,btohqsg
In that context  one example is Microsoft Mathematics,btohqsg
But now idk if they provide it now ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
dk if sage or maple counts,btohqsg
Didn't they went through hyperinflation years ago ?,btohqsg
You can pay your workers in millions to save cost hiring from other 3rd world country,btohqsg
Lol ! I shouldn't be laughing ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ as hyperinflation is quite serious issue but I am laughing real hard.,btohqsg
Slavery used to be legal not long ago ðŸ˜³,btohqsg
But then it begs the question   what if AI bots become evolved as smart as humans?,btohqsg
AI cant even answer my physics questions,btohqsg
it'll take some time for it to be as smart as humans,btohqsg
how can it be a user error if i just slap the qns into AI and they cant even answer it,btohqsg
Gotta ask it in a format it can understand,btohqsg
If a Martian is unable to understand English. Would you automatically conclude that it is dumb?,btohqsg
A martian isnt a byproduct of humans,btohqsg
AI is something created by us to be able to mimic us  so its logical to conclude that if it cannot do the very thing that it is supposed to do  then it is dumb?,btohqsg
im asking it to mimic a physics genius to answer my qns and it cant :(,btohqsg
I won't call ChatGPT as something create to mimic us,btohqsg
It can mimic us but it's purpose and as product isn't for mimicry,btohqsg
The data set is used as a product to automate and compute more efficiently,btohqsg
In the same ways computers made things more efficient,btohqsg
all that efficient computation with all the data base they can access and they somehow still cant answer my physics questions?,btohqsg
As i said its a formating issue.,btohqsg
If you explain the problem to ChatGPT,btohqsg
And asked for a logical solution,btohqsg
If i can understand the problem  surely chatgpt  supposedly created by humans  would be able to understand it,btohqsg
Or at least the most probable one,btohqsg
It doesn't understand in the same way humans do,btohqsg
It understand words as binary code juxtaposed and in occurrence tgt,btohqsg
aite i suppose that is a point,btohqsg
Well   things is humans vs bots ... bots requires a lot of infrastructure to mimic even a fraction of human intelligence,btohqsg
That is using today's tech ofc,btohqsg
But in future things may be different,btohqsg
I use chat gpt to format my notes,btohqsg
i mean try uncensored AI with MYAB,btohqsg
Anyone have a interest in cars? If so I present to you this smol car,btohqsg
