Guys  with the current COE market.Wise to get a PARF car like eg: $40 000 left 3years.Or get a COE car like eg: $40 000 but left with 4years 6mth.Non conti. KDM or JDM.,btohqsg
Hahaha ur bio… made me laugh…,btohqsg
with current coe  it's the wisest to not get a car,btohqsg

Hi guys  is new car loan at 2.78% signed in August24 considered high?I see market now around 1.8%?,btohqsg
Hi all What’s your take on COE Lexus IS250 ?How’s the maintenance and reliability ah ?Totally new to lexus.,btohqsg
Very Reliable. Advice. Throw the 4GR engine and swap it with the 2GR. Nvr fail me once. but i crashed it so now im rebuilding it back.,btohqsg
Thanks 😌But maintenance wise ? More expensive than normal JDM/KDM ? Or still the same. Not on par with Conti right ?,btohqsg
It should be more expensive than normal asian cars  because Lexus  like Euro cars  their parts can be very inaccessible  pain in the ass to reach  hence the high maintenance cost.,btohqsg
But generally it's more reliable than euro cars,btohqsg
So if nothing goes wrong  it should not be any more expensive to maintain than your usual asian cars,btohqsg
Lexus is a good and reliable carmaintenance will be ard JDM car as its under Toyota Arm,btohqsg
Tad bit more expensive than normal jdm but still manageable,btohqsg
