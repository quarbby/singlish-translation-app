i am wondering about the second appt after you pay the option fee,btohqsg
HLE is to see how much you can loan/afford so they can access if you can afford buying the house,btohqsg
Thats the agreement for lease am I right?,btohqsg
Thats where they access/advice/judge whether you can afford the house  how you can make payment and all,btohqsg
So HLE then is a gauge for them to see,btohqsg
i had read at that point you pay 20% of the house via your CPF. there's no mention of EHG.,btohqsg
How much can you loan and how much EHG CPF Cash all,btohqsg
EHG will be credited by then already,btohqsg
If not can call the officer,btohqsg
Then after that key collection they will give u a final loan offer,btohqsg
They will also send u letter whether u need to reapply hle,btohqsg
Cos hle is available for 6 months,btohqsg
so to confirm the process -1. get bto number2. go for appt  select unit  show hle application  pay option fee- in between - EHG is credited to the couple3. go for agreement of lease  pay 20% downpayment.correct?,btohqsg
Should be  but mine is staggered downpayment scheme,btohqsg
HLE application is in no 3?,btohqsg
So is 5% for the 3rd appointment,btohqsg
Mine is 5% at sign lease and 5% at key collection,btohqsg
ah! great! my cpf savings wont be depleted ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
you can opt at the signing of lease?,btohqsg
this is outdated also  now its 5% and 15% from 30 Sep 2022 onwards,btohqsg
youâ€™re automatically opted in if you meet the eligibility,btohqsg
oh yea I saw the HDB info Web liao,btohqsg
If youre below 30 no need scared. Hahahaha,btohqsg
it says the younger applicant though. so should be fine.,btohqsg
but i'm more interested in whether at the first stage is the EHG disbursed?,btohqsg
no EHG is disbursed later on,btohqsg
Hi does anyone knows how the deferred income works after I got a number from the balloting? ( things like - When do we present our students/ns certification),btohqsg

So Emily  do they need to bring student card for first appt?,btohqsg

Hi I got a queue #30 to pick a flat next month .... just wondering if not taking loan when will they ask for the full sum of the flat?,btohqsg
Oh that means 5 years later then need to pay... so next month need to pay anything?,btohqsg
Depends u take how many room,btohqsg
Can only pay by nets i think,btohqsg
Then when u sign lease  they will reimburse you back the option fee,btohqsg
Mine was about a few months after the option fee,btohqsg
the reimburse of option fees no more already,btohqsg
the last batch reimburse is was for 2020 november bto projects,btohqsg
