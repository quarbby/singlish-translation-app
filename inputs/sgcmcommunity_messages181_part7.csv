Hello  what additives would you highly recommend to add to your fuel system.,btohqsg
Can use those boosters & cleaners at the same time?,btohqsg
Haha it can be yours for the right price,btohqsg
Don't really need those. Once in a while  you can just pump the higher end fuel from Shell/Caltex to use it to clean your engine. The price you pay for the additives  can add up to pay for those premium fuel once in a while.,btohqsg
Go JB put shell Racing ah ü§£,btohqsg
But you'll need 3/4 tank full to travel over to JB tho. So might not be a good option for some.,btohqsg
Take risk   1/4 tank go inside . Not always they will check .,btohqsg
