Yeahh  gone are the days of flashy car meaning status or wealth,btohqsg
3 room HDB carpark aso alot flashy cars.,btohqsg
can see when u pass by,btohqsg
Which to me is something very nice  everyone across the board enjoying what they like rather than chasing public image. Still have people buying the badge also but to each their own,btohqsg
Yes only if u have a new Ferrari rolls Royce and such,btohqsg
If you trying impress ppl with like a old coe car or some basic modelForget it,btohqsg
Old COE car no problem  sometimes they are better buys than newer cars at the price  but must buy for the car not the flex,btohqsg
actly i get impressed by coe cars.. especially if they renewed 2-3 times already,btohqsg
Respect to those maintaining them well!,btohqsg
the older one pre 2000 still quite possible.. newer ones these days don't age well,btohqsg
too complicated too much things can go wrong,btohqsg
Why not? You like to floor in front of lights. It’s better for you.,btohqsg
i saying i like classic car haha,btohqsg
Those that are renewed multiple times,btohqsg
okay la some not too bad. was looking at a Crown Athlete GRS200. looked like a pretty solid car from 2008,btohqsg
yepp  R129 W124 E30 E36 E34 ferrari 328 360 and the list goes on,btohqsg
90s cars are definitely my favourite haha,btohqsg
The last rear wheel drive car with rear gearbox,btohqsg
Since Alfa 75. Alfa screwed up not continuing rear drive until the Giulia,btohqsg
The more tech there is  the harder to keep it going longer  2015+ cars already look dated at times,btohqsg
Why do you like e34? It’s a so so car.,btohqsg
But e34 m5 is quite special,btohqsg
That’s the beginning of the m5. The engineer souped your a regular e34 and found gem.,btohqsg
wow must put a hammer inside car just in case,btohqsg
they are all very nice car to have haha  just that sg v rare,btohqsg
i quite like the styling and the M5 is very special to me haha,btohqsg
It depent what type of cars and the intention   I mean those ppl buy a coe car to flex can just forget it liao,btohqsg
Girl will tell you Porsche is poor man Ferrari..Feel like giving 1 big slap..,btohqsg
Then why bother to even talk to her   unless the guy wanted to buy a Porsche to impress the gal that is driving a Ferrari ?,btohqsg

Saw this just now. Lady driver,btohqsg
My neighbors own 2 Taycan 1 belong to his daughter,btohqsg
