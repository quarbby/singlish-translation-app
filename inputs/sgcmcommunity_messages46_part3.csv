Hello everyone  may I know  to your best knowledge  what is the average amount claimed during a vehicle accident (rear-end),btohqsg
Also depends if engine is at the front or back,btohqsg
Anyone ever towed their vehicle from KL to sg,btohqsg
@Jingxunnsir your volvo a bit out of place,btohqsg
Protected by 2 RR in front and a Range R (not in pic) and behind by Ah Bent,btohqsg
what... why all the cool cars and then the rolls and bentley spoil the picture😵‍💫😵‍💫🤔🤔,btohqsg
I rear ended a Honda Freed.,btohqsg
Total claim from passenger + him was 29k sgd.,btohqsg
he didn't thank you for the easy payday ah,btohqsg
I didn’t bother replying me the moment he told me he ok w private settlement  however that’s if I am willing to pay the amount he asked for.,btohqsg
So I told him that I’m sorry  I may be young  but I am not new in this field.,btohqsg
that's bullshit  just let insurance company  do their work and assess if their claim is legit,btohqsg
I told him I bring your vehicle to Kah motors to fix his entire rear portion it wouldn’t even cost that much.,btohqsg
His passenger claim for myalgia was a total of 9000$sgd.,btohqsg
But nice work telling me the following day in the morning that his wife & him were fine  and that he’ll let me know how much the reparations would cost after he got a quotation from them  however till the evening there’s no reply and he subsequently said “oh sorry  my wife and I decided to visit a doctor because we developed pain after waking up”,btohqsg
I then didn’t bother replying him. I told him you got my details  please enjoy the insurance.,btohqsg
I think he probably thought that I am relatively young and that this was his opportunity. That’s pretty sad.,btohqsg
"in other words  ""we googled how to get more money from the other driver and now go keng at doctor""",btohqsg
Well actually I am mostly disappointed because he was almost 2 times my age yet he was unethical after telling me that we can go ahead w/ private settlement,btohqsg
But either way I’ve still done the reporting w/in 24hrs.,btohqsg
you just need to tell them  will let insurance company handle the claim  and will report them to police for fraud,btohqsg
Yup  I subsequently received a TP letter > stating that I am to report to TP as the case is being investigated,btohqsg
That was when I was guessing he probably received 3 days or more of MC.,btohqsg
So guess what? I called the TP IO and he said it was as such. So he said it’s just a small accident he’ll just give me a warning.,btohqsg
Never ask him $290 000 better or 2 900 000,btohqsg
This kind hard to report police for fraud,btohqsg
Because I bang him sure lose case,btohqsg
I banged him on highway when he jammed break all of a sudden (traffic was going slow though),btohqsg
But I had just switched lane and in that 0.5s it was impossible to stop,btohqsg
So oh well  consider it my luck.,btohqsg
But I believe in karma.. he can claim all he want  290k also can.. but I believe someday someone will claim him just like that.,btohqsg
If he drives a mercs I think he’ll be claiming a brand new car,btohqsg
I have a friend that into a Mercedes c180 a couple years ago.,btohqsg
The uncle claimed him privately  but told him that he only repairs his car at the AD (C&C).,btohqsg
And that he needs a substitute car while the car is undergoing downtime.,btohqsg
Can u come and bang my car rear?,btohqsg
Subsequently my friend received a high claim (not exactly sure how much) for the replacement vehicle.,btohqsg
