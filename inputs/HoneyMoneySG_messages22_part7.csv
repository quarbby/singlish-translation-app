Yes. Upto 8k  assuming you don't meet the 80k total relief amount.,btohqsg
Ok great. Now just need to do some homework on which to park the money.,btohqsg
Thanks everyone for the quick reply,btohqsg
For simplicity  SA will get you an automatic 4% whereas the SRS has practically zero interest and you'll need to reinvest into something to earn. CPF SA is simpler to manage from this perspective  whereas SRS requires some self monitoring.,btohqsg

i saw revolut can't exchange sgd to myr?,btohqsg
just wondering which rate they will be using. will be better than wise?,btohqsg
I just bought something from qoo10 using grabonline. It seem I have some booster points from grab.,btohqsg
eh  i saw revolut support much less country currency than wise  it doesn't even support krw.ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I went in....July? I know it was beating local moneychangers and around 0.05 off thexe.comrate but not sure about Wise,btohqsg
noted  it's ok because we don't have to go to local money exchanger  save more time regardless of the 0.05 lower exchange rate.,btohqsg
Now have online money changer. Thinmargin. They will sent the currency to your home.,btohqsg

It shd be an excel file,btohqsg
Hmmm ok thatâ€™s what I thought and had opened it earlier this year . Thanks,btohqsg
Not really. I think the best is Revolut for weekdays withdrawal  free for up to 350 sgd limit. I know the HSBC ATM in KL donâ€™t have chargeable fees to use their ATM machines. Unsure if Revolut has the best FX spread.,btohqsg
Just to add on this but diff card. For HSBC Revolution card. Agoda via Atome pay is eligible for 10x rewards. Confirm with bank ðŸ¤—,btohqsg
Personally IMO  Trust is inferior to Amaze>Mastercard (CRMC)  considering additional cashback / miles points & 1% cashback (for overseas spend)If I need hard cash  Revolut overseas atm withdrawal for weekdays for first 350 sgd.,btohqsg
But the 1% only can be use when hit $2k right  which I donâ€™t think will hit 2k for my travel,btohqsg
1 instapoint = 1 sgd spent overseas correct. Personally  not a fan of using trust card (credit). Maybe I will consider ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
you go MY just tap will auto convert from sgd,btohqsg
Hi  if I do topup to cpf SA account by Jan 2023 will it do tax relief as well?,btohqsg
so all i need to do is just use the amaze card overseas and just tap? do i need to make any adjustments or anything?going new zealand planning to try the card,btohqsg
Yes  top up deadline is 31dec2022  and ur SA has not hit FRS,btohqsg
It will be tax relief for 2023 income. It is recommended to top up in Jan to max earn the CPF interest,btohqsg
Am I right then the top up of Childâ€™s OA account is not included for relief of tax? Only MA/SA ?,btohqsg
My understanding is that top up to child regardless of oa  ma or sa is not included in tax relief.,btohqsg
In normal times  yes. But interest rates outside is now higher than OA rates. In fact  I'm now drawing down my OA for my mortgage.,btohqsg
What I meant is if u want to earn the max CPF interest. Now related to other investment comparison. As diff people has different approach,btohqsg
More from a point of Tax relief guys,btohqsg
Does it mean that it is better to top up MA/SA at one go instead of multiple top ups over the year?,btohqsg
I think the interest for cpf is computed monthly,btohqsg
So its best to topup at one go in jan,btohqsg
So using trust card for overseas is under credit card and not debit? Dont have to pre load?,btohqsg
Is UNIQLO online payment eligible for UOB one cashback ? Not sure if itâ€™s consider as retail for such online payment,btohqsg
Hmmmm... Both SA and MA maxed but given the increment in MA we got opportunity to top up 2.5k with cash come Jan to get additional tax relief for next year?Is that correct huh?,btohqsg
Just wondering  since MA limits are only increased after annual interest is credited  does SA limit also follow the same trend? Ie if FRS is already achieved  does it mean that we can also top up SA on 1st Jan?,btohqsg
Oh I see. It is to reap maximum interest right?,btohqsg
