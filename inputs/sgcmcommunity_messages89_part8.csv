Just to check with you guys   STA inspection grade reliable or do I need to send for further inspection after purchasing second hand car?,btohqsg
Erm. Try to send for further inspection before the purchase better,btohqsg
So STA inspection is not enough arh ?,btohqsg
Any recommendation on where should I send it to,btohqsg
Because STA grade came back an A,btohqsg
Then I read online   there’s people saying STA grade cannot be believe,btohqsg
Send to your workshop that u trust ask them do a prepurchase inspection.,btohqsg
I always believe in having double confirmation  esp for 2nd hand cars.. never know what the prev owner do.. or sometimes accident car prev owner workshop never fix properly.,btohqsg
i suggest u bring to a ws which specializes in the brand,btohqsg
just curious  what car is it?,btohqsg
Replace the sd card or camera if necessary,btohqsg
hybrid pls check. Replace the battery not cheap wor,btohqsg
Not that cannot believe   but just not sufficient,btohqsg
Such issues sta won't detect.@Sgcarmarthas lobang for ppi rite?,btohqsg
Do a battery integrity check (or something like that)  where each cell is checked,btohqsg
Not sure if I got it right though 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Yes  going to replace the car camera to idrive12,btohqsg
I think not in sta's sop lol but you should get it checked  usually it's those ws that has hybrid expertise,btohqsg
Grade A means less than 20k km or something also... Practically new,btohqsg
I think they mainly check for no accident and general road worthiness,btohqsg
Registered for 2 yrs plus but covered only 15k km? That's about under 7k km a year...possible?,btohqsg
