But you can start the course first,btohqsg
If you feel that you dislike it   you may apply for a transfer.,btohqsg
But the downside is   you probably need to wait for the next year or something if the course has started for quite awhile,btohqsg
Oh okay thanks I tot can cause I saw this in reddit,btohqsg
That ‘s what my friend did.,btohqsg
So can accept the course then appeal also?,btohqsg
Looks like a 🐟 in the sky.,btohqsg
Cat in the hat as an aeroplane?,btohqsg
Like do you think companies (biz accounting course),btohqsg
Will like allow brightly dyed hair or something,btohqsg
No. Accountants are expected to be robots. Robots do not have hair,btohqsg
Also accountants are expected to sleep only 4hrs a day. Having hair means more time needed to maintain it. No hairs means more time to rest.So almost accountants have no hair:p,btohqsg
Lol the past few days I have 3-4 hours of sleep,btohqsg

hello! is it normal if u find the emath tys qns easier than the prelim papers?,btohqsg
So if you find the sch prelim papers are too hard and may make u demoralised u can just focus on doing timed practices for TYS first,btohqsg
I believe prelim papers are deliberately set harder than the tys in most instances,btohqsg
Is Plymouth degree recognised in SH,btohqsg
Anyone know where I can donate my IB books QwQ?,btohqsg

err what's that ah HHAHAH is it sec3 topic????,btohqsg
u could use a countdown widget,btohqsg
Hey guys! Just wondering  would y’all be interested in a similar app by SGExams ?,btohqsg
ya HAHAHA but i learned it ltr in the year,btohqsg
What are the features yall usually require ?,btohqsg
Integration with Google calendar and clock,btohqsg
i guess something similar to what google calendar has- ability to categorize by colour- ability to choose colours even with hex codes- timetableothers- countdown to exam/test/impt dates,btohqsg
target setting would be good too (?),btohqsg
okok Ill take this up with the team and see if we can get something done regarding this. Let me know if yall need some specific features,btohqsg
yk apps such as everyday (habit forming? app)  or tracker apps?something like that but to track progress (in terms of grades),btohqsg
interesting but what in your words means measuring progress. Is it grades overtime or how many questions did you do or your error rate,btohqsg
honestly adding all 3 would be greatbut i initially meant grades over time,btohqsg
Its an interesting concept nonetheless hahaha,btohqsg
