It can be either or both,btohqsg
Ah that's not my fault alrd,btohqsg
you nvr did clarify with me,btohqsg
a lot of aglio olio in sg is like just olive oil as the sauce and not olive oil to make the sauce,btohqsg
I re read that what u talking,btohqsg

"but then if ur talking about whether ip ppl will want to make friends with jaei will say it largely depends. js keep an open mind and dont make assumptions like ""oh theyll ostracise me"" because alot of these things are self fulfilling prophecies. also its good to make the first move since ppl alr know their friends for q long so its normal that they want to be with familiar ppl",btohqsg
Why u so against rp haha,btohqsg
generally even if ip ppl dont want to be close friends with jae   they will be polite and civil  but there will be a distance,btohqsg

Girls express fashion: empowering!Guys express fashion: Let’s make fun of him.,btohqsg
way to take it completely out of context lol,btohqsg
I know you all dont like this Josh but this is the last thing to criticise him for,btohqsg
Idt I've seen u ard b4   are u new?,btohqsg
it's js a very weird reason to choose a certain education pathway over another js because you can grow your hair out in one,btohqsg
also we were talking about how josh is not going to get to wear what he wants and grow his hair long in NS,btohqsg
It'll be funny asf if that person came from disc,btohqsg
i think the possibility is there,btohqsg
don't tell the the person defending josh,btohqsg
What if the person is josh,btohqsg
nah idt josh is that wuliao,btohqsg
I dont think he would be the kind of person to make alts to defend himself,btohqsg
It seems that Josh places significant value on individuality and personal expression  and it is not your business to invalidate him,btohqsg
Maybe it's someone who share similar ideals as josh,btohqsg
how to study h2 organic chem in 5 days,btohqsg
since when did i invalidate him? I was simply making a point that a guy will not get to grow his hair long or wear what he wants while serving as a national serviceman,btohqsg
man if it were me I'd just study wtv I can and just chiong alr,btohqsg
If I were sitting for As,btohqsg
Your initial point was that he chose poly over JC for the greater freedom of expression,btohqsg
Now you’re redirecting the focus to the NS part?,btohqsg
Please have a look at which message I replied to,btohqsg
so if he chooses poly to grow his hair out hes gonna have to chop it all off when he signs on,btohqsg
im preparing for some comp that’s in like 5 days ☠️☠️,btohqsg
and they’re testing up to a level stuff,btohqsg
And so? You don’t dress up for it to last forever,btohqsg
I mean there's utube As summary,btohqsg
I just scared information overload for u,btohqsg
and jc/ns is only 2 years so its also not like youll have to follow rules forever,btohqsg
anyw josh probably has other reasons to go poly other than js the long hair,btohqsg
I try run 2.4km every week,btohqsg
we were just pointing out about how its funny to go to poly js because you can express urself a certain way only for that form of self expression to be taken away 3 years later,btohqsg
hey hey no need for such harsh words  as much as freedom of expression goes  let's have mutual respect,btohqsg
u r outnumbered. u btr back down,btohqsg
maybe im acting but you definitely arent 🫨🫨🫨,btohqsg
I said that Josh goes to poly so he can express himself more freely for those 3 years. Yes he will have to cut it off during NS  but what truly matters is that he is happy with how he looks during the 3 years itself. He can enjoy it while it lasts.,btohqsg
um idk sorry but shld be after 1feb,btohqsg
no one want talk to you sorry,btohqsg
It's just you have better ways of expressing your thoughts😅,btohqsg
also crazy day  pe cher throw the hockey stick at a student lol,btohqsg
I play badminton I throw racket,btohqsg
not like throw buy like underand slide hit,btohqsg
he was aiming to hit the student lol,btohqsg
like like full force throw lah,btohqsg
sch nowadays 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥,btohqsg
may i hv a summary of wht is happening,btohqsg
imagine if the cher like fooking javelin throw lmao,btohqsg
Josh chose to go poly for freedom of expression  eg growing out his hair. Matcha here was making fun of him for it  and also mentioned him going to NS afterwards where he has to shave it off.,btohqsg
how was i making fun of him lol,btohqsg
Perhaps I can give you the benefit of the doubt,btohqsg
i js made a statement that he wouldnt be able to keep his long hair and express himself through his clothing in ns,btohqsg
how you interpret it is uty lol,btohqsg
The point remains that you do not think him choosing to go to poly because of long hair is a wise choice,btohqsg
do us a favour and not come in with a saviour complex and assume a moral high ground,btohqsg
Wah now putting words into my mouth alr ah,btohqsg
also just last week a brand new cher join sch start of yr threaten to throw hands lol,btohqsg
every1 is so hushhush abt it,btohqsg
that isn't making fun of him having to cut off his hair to become almost bald  that's just stating that he has to shave his hair once he goes to NS  or at least the realisation that he has to,btohqsg
even in sec 1 sum replacement cher come in n when ppl doing tiktok vids or smth he knock the phone n sum other stuff lol,btohqsg
by very weird i mean that its very unusual and unconventional,btohqsg
blossomscan don't be so rude ornot? mutual respect here pls,btohqsg
that's not matcha implying that it's a bad choice that's just what matcha is saying,btohqsg
and statistically speaking it is indeed quite unusual for students to choose an educational path based on whether or not freedom of expression is allowed in the institution itself,btohqsg
"we had to go down to another room  gather us and was like ""blah blah blah do not speak about it outside of sch""",btohqsg
The word weird has a negative connotation,btohqsg
Of course it is. Still we should respect his personal decisions.,btohqsg
"so whenever i say weird it means it's badlike""it's weird we only have NS for 2 years not like 3 or 4 years""",btohqsg
who thinks chicken rice is meh most of the time,btohqsg
so it's bad that NS is only 2 years and not 3 or 4?,btohqsg
u eat 1 uve eaten them all,btohqsg
just because it has a negative connotation doesn't mean it's necessarily bad,btohqsg
I don’t get why you chose that example because I cannot imagine anyone  save for some ultra patriots saying that,btohqsg
its okkkk  but not smth i wld pick if i in a new area,btohqsg
its always the rice too mushy or smth,btohqsg
Why is blossoms wait what is happening,btohqsg
"I was agreeing with blossoms up until ""weird""",btohqsg
Anyways what's everyone favorite plant from plant vs zombies 2,btohqsg
"oritehow bout""It's weird that the amt of carbohydrates on this particular meal is decreasing constantly""",btohqsg
Like fr what does NS have to do with why one goes to poly or not,btohqsg
ite ce east delights chicken rice🔥🔥🔥 is so good omg,btohqsg
I sincerely hope blossoms is not an A levels gp student for the sake of cambridge,btohqsg
when u wadio to when uni start,btohqsg
we were talking about josh so one of josh reason to go poly is because he could grow his hair out and wear what he wantsso i made a statement repeated josh's words and said: when he goes nsso blossoms thinks i am making fun of him and his right to self expression,btohqsg
At the end of the day even though the reason is weird doesn't mean it's not a valid reason imoDiff people diff opinions,btohqsg
Eh I missed out the middle part,btohqsg
Alright  it does not have a negative connotation all the time. My badI said that earlier because I felt it did have a negative connotation in Matcha’s earlier comment.,btohqsg
I mean we all know when Josh goes ns he's gonna have some sense knocked into him hopefully,btohqsg
this online beef get serious 😭🙏 nobody safe fr,btohqsg
Also don't need say that cuz ur just poking the bear,btohqsg
exactly my pointjust like what matcha said  the tone of the message of what matcha said is just how we think it's said not how it's actually said,btohqsg
we should all just chill and write GP essays about our points,btohqsg
Idw read shitty gp essays for today,btohqsg
why does woman need stay home,btohqsg
ok im gnna nuke all the discord screenshots,btohqsg
Uk my friend wrote an essay on why women should be eradicated,btohqsg
And sent it to my gp teacher,btohqsg
Also note to self  I find that your emotions were clouding your judgement   sometimes it's good to take a step back and rethink things before we do them,btohqsg
What gender is your GP teacher in the first place,btohqsg
I'm sorry but this is so patronizing,btohqsg
Tbf he was used as a case study in some schs for GP,btohqsg
your feelings the colour of shit,btohqsg
How U expect me to phrase it otherwise 😭,btohqsg
Someone's gotta break it to em,btohqsg
