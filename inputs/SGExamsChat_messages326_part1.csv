Essay dissection +  familiarise yourself with the basic essays. Usually the essay question are permutations of those essay qns  the scope and the focus of topic  and the phrasing is the one that throw ppl off. SBQ wise - be familiar with the key contextual knowledge  and practice more papers. Consult your teachers to check your answering techniques.,btohqsg
Essays also need practice  i would suggest practicing essay outlines while preparing for exams besides timed practice sessions.  This helps in essay dissection + clarification of thoughts process,btohqsg
memorising (that's how it works for me 🤣),btohqsg
SEQ is legit memory work and SBCS is just practice and practice and practice,btohqsg
and familiarising urself w the formats ofc,btohqsg
Yup. depends on which level you are at now  sec school or JC. The methods are roughly the same:) Memory work inevitable,btohqsg
i guess true. is just my take on this as someone who took pure history for O levels and H2 history at A levels. Now a history major also,btohqsg
hello!! may i ask what are the prospects of a history major? i did consider initially but it seems to be centered around only academia and education,btohqsg
"From NTU website on job prospects for majoring in History: ""History graduates are adept at research  analysis and writing. They can consider archival work  business  defence and intelligence research  diplomacy  education  journalism  publishing  project management  public relations and advertising  library and information operations  museum curation and management  policy-making  think-tank research  tourism  and even content development of computer games as potential future career options. """,btohqsg
In Uni  History is more than just memorizing. Is a total different ball game all together. Management of deadlines and readings to read for class is important or there goes your GPA,btohqsg
History modules are mainly assessed on your ability to write clearly and critically. Part of it would be your ability to contribute to class discussions. This can only be done if you read the assigned readings for the week.,btohqsg
The weightage of 1 essay can be as high as 50% of your grade for the module,btohqsg
how if you contrast this with polsci? why did u pick history over polsci or is it just due to sheer interest,btohqsg
3 5 pages long kinda essays? or thesis typa stuff,btohqsg
