yea need to see whether got the cashback,btohqsg
May i ask on credit card options for:1.Housing installations2.Dental3.MedicalI am open to cashbacks/miles,btohqsg
1. If you're talking about mortgage installments  no known avenue for credit card payments. You can use EGA GIRO for 1% Everyday+ cashback2  3: Assuming these are private clinics: UOB PPV (pay via contactless)  Amaze + CRMC  or UOB EVOL.,btohqsg
Think they should be valid for 4mpd. I'm using GOMO recurring payment via dbs wwmc and it is counted for 4mpd.,btohqsg
If the hospital is public govt hospitals?Dentals will be private,btohqsg
Supposedly CRMC and paying by healthhub app will give you 4 mpd,btohqsg
I see soo the citi rewards is good enough for private dental and public hospitals payment via healthhub app then,btohqsg
Amaze+CRMC to convert offline dental to online,btohqsg
Healthhub is already online no need amaze,btohqsg
So technically this applies for everything other than travel charges ??,btohqsg

To be super clear: HSBC EGA Bank account and HSBC Credit Card are 2 SEPARATE PROMOSTo qualify  you must NOT HOLD or cancel in the past 12 months- HSBC EGA for the EGA $350 promo- HSBC Credit Card for the Card $300 promoOnce again  these two offers are INDEPENDENT of each other.HSBCHSBC Everyday Global Account https://hmsg.link/hsbcegaHSBC Advance Visa https://hmsg.link/hsbcadvanceHSBC Platinum Visa https://hmsg.link/hsbcplatinumHSBC Revolution https://hmsg.link/hsbcrevolution,btohqsg
Oh okay got it  basically as long as we are not a hsbc credit card holder for the past 12 months  we are counted as a new user and eligible for it,btohqsg

Just an update - for the yoga studio I go  I used DBS World Women for the package bought online and only got 1x rewards cause its classified under Personal/Misc Services ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
can add hsbc revo to liquidpay/shopback pay/favepay,btohqsg
got wait till next month 16th for bonus points?,btohqsg
Thanks for clarification üôè Just to double confirm: these are 2 separate promos  both require new user for deposit accounts and cc or just require respectively? Cos I already have their cc‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I checked other purchases within same month and  it yielded more points,btohqsg
Means other transactions under DBS WWMC gained more x points than the yoga package,btohqsg
u looking at bonus points for each transaction?,btohqsg
Nope  normal transactions cause I was wondering what the MCC for the online yoga package is,btohqsg
what u mean by other transactions gain more x points? are these foreign spending so getting 3x base points instead of 1x point?How u know 1x points only and no 9x bonus points for the yoga package. when was the transaction made. Already received bonus points on 16th on following calendar month?,btohqsg
I used this info to determine if is 1x or 2x. Will wait for the 16th to determine if there's bonus points thenhttps://milelion.com/2019/04/18/dbs-virtual-assistant-now-provides-mccs-and-rewards-points-per-transaction/,btohqsg
yah  all eligible local spend get 1x points first,btohqsg
Has anybody got the $10 rebate from this promo? Is it must wait for 14 days?,btohqsg
require separately. i.e. you hold hsbc card but no ega  can do ega promo,btohqsg
So if I don't intend to subscribe hsbc cc. I ca still eligible for the singsaver promo right.,btohqsg
yes  ega doesnt care about card  card doesnt care about ega,btohqsg
That‚Äôs as expected haha üôè btw the 2 consecutive 5k when can transfer out? Same month or like 2 months later. They never mention the balance (except the min 2k) to maintain for this promo,btohqsg
No sure leh‚Ä¶ seems like not mentioned in tnc,btohqsg
not mentioned means no such restriction,btohqsg
One more thing if you intend to apply for EGA but not the CC  you still need to fulfill 5x transactions with the Debit card at least,btohqsg
My transaction on 3rd jan. $10 rebate not in yet..,btohqsg
Yeah of course as I‚Äôm using the revolution card,btohqsg
