Spotted here in North Portugal  500 hp Seat Ibiza PD130 engine  owner is my friend,btohqsg
They do crazy work on diesel engines in Portugal,btohqsg
They push PD130 engine ( 1.9 tdi ) to almost 700hp,btohqsg

Was the only Australian car brand but sadly they got fucked over by GM ownership (similar to SAAB) and ceased to exist in 2020,btohqsg
anyways that's a commodore I think,btohqsg
I was searching for other things in this chat and I came across it. Since nobody answer  I answer lo,btohqsg
that guy cuz someone finallyanswered him,btohqsg
"SEATs are fun little thingsAlways love how they do stuffVW: ""My Spanish child  here is my Golf GTI MK7. All you have to do is change the body and badge to make your new Leon Cupra""SEAT: ""AYE CARAMBA!! We +50hp to the engine and we remove half the airbags because in Spain  when we crash we die like real men!!""",btohqsg
used to ride this car last year during f1,btohqsg
I laughed so much at the last part 🤣 but it’s facts,btohqsg
i think a lot of ppl get to ride it last year,btohqsg
Usually the Leon Cupra is higher-HP but less features and luxuries than the Golf GTI of that same gen,btohqsg
Among which I recall  passengers and side curtain airbags is standard on the GTI but optional extra on the Cupra,btohqsg
But here they just go crazy with diesel engines,btohqsg
Leon cupra in kinda same as golf gti CS,btohqsg
In a way  the Leon Cupra is a less expensive and less luxurious Golf GTI CS,btohqsg
anyone know where the BMW M3 GTR’s are in the world & how many were made?,btohqsg
In order to homologate the M3 GTR for racing  a road version was developed during calendar year 2001 and shown for the first time at the season ending ALMS Petit Le Mans race. BMW produced 10 development units of which 3 were production ready display cars. For homologation purposes  the M3 GTR needed to be offered for sale to the general public and by Petit Le Mans 2001  the car was ready. The M3 GTR was to be priced at€250 000 [86]When ALMS changed the homologation rules at the end of the 2001 season  the road version project was stopped. All 7 development prototypes were recycled but the three production ready display cars exist to this day and all still owned by BMW AG. One of the Road M3 GTRs was displayed by BMW of North America LLC atLegends of the Autobahnin 2015 along with the newly restored ALMS race version of the car.[87]The road cars were built alongside bodies-in-white of the GTR race cars in the special vehicles department of BMW's Regensburg Plant.,btohqsg
Basically they followed the rulebook that said that they needed to sell 10 road legal M3 GTR to homologate the M3 GTR race car,btohqsg
When the rules were changed to become 100 (because Porsche complained TEACHER  BMW IS CHEATING) BMW decided to scrap the road car program (7 recycled  the remaining 3 are still with BMW) and discontinue the M3 GTR racing program,btohqsg
U ARE AN LTA SPY  RIGHT?,btohqsg
he's the person who told lta about our cars n sleighs meet 😱😱,btohqsg
This is turning into Singapore Cat Meets Chat and im all for it,btohqsg
Looks almost like Monday the cat on the left,btohqsg
I saw them 2 years ago at the pet expo,btohqsg
Best sticker for a German car,btohqsg
Omg same  I hope this year I can see them at this year's pet expo ~,btohqsg
guys is there an lambo essenza in Singapore,btohqsg
as long as u believe in ur heart,btohqsg
ts probably like fake news or smth,btohqsg
it got spotted here a few months ago,btohqsg
Production of the Essenza SCV12 is limited to 40 units. The car is not legal for road use and is planned to have its own one-make racing series. The cars will be stored in a special hangar built near the Sant'Agata factory with the owners having the ability to monitor their cars via an app linked to security cameras. Lamborghini would let the customer take delivery of their car upon request  akin to Maserati who allowed customers to take delivery of theMC12 Versione Corse. Lamborghini is responsible for the maintenance and transportation of the cars to any one of the FIA class 1 tracks around the world  in the case that the owner does not wish to keep the car. Customers can also receive coaching from Lamborghini racing driversEmanuele PirroandMarco Mapelli.,btohqsg
it's so hard to believe but believable at the same time,btohqsg
well a little research online wld help back it up too,btohqsg
It probably hides in a bonded warehouse when not at a track,btohqsg
No way you will park this guy in your private garage due to the specialist storage and care required,btohqsg
And of course you don't want to pay the fucking GST and duty on this thing,btohqsg
how much maintenance even for these lor nvr start up(battery drain like siao 😂),btohqsg
and yes the obligatory cat photo,btohqsg
You will be surprised how much care goes into these bonded warehouse with climate control  someone goes to start them up every now and them based on a schedule  someone else arranges for them to go servicing as per manufacturer SOP etc,btohqsg
A friend of mine  this is literally his job,btohqsg
ill go check one of them out soon..,btohqsg
got a visit for 1 of the cars in one of them warehouse soon but the car is under maintenance now,btohqsg
but yeah im not too sure how the warehouses work but seems like its complex,btohqsg
Monday: Start Carrera GTTuesday: Start Chiron  send Sesto Elemento to agent for servicing,btohqsg
seems tough(they should let me work there),btohqsg
And very secure  there is literally millions and millions of dollars worth in cars in there,btohqsg
(idm take 1 dollar an hour pay),btohqsg
Because to their owners they are investments,btohqsg
It's not too different from buying a condo or landed house,btohqsg
You buy a Chiron at launch,btohqsg
How much can you auction it for 10 years later,btohqsg
Or you bought a McLaren F1 in the 1990s,btohqsg
How much is it worth today?,btohqsg
The best is any Ferrari from the 1960s,btohqsg
Any Ferrari from that era is worth 8 digits in USD,btohqsg
Buy for USD800K sell for USD21M,btohqsg
this is precisely why my friend@a_junnchose a kia cerato over all the paganis,btohqsg
My friend has been in this industry for years  he spent several years in BMW  Porsche etc. He's now with Aston Martin (Wearnes),btohqsg
Of course since the number of AM sold in SG is so low  his job most of the time is in Wearnes' bonded warehouses,btohqsg
name somethings you would find in the search history of a subaru owner,btohqsg
how to find good head gaskets,btohqsg
that is what my friend would say,btohqsg
will my vape get rid of burnt clutch smell,btohqsg

but seriously the engine is definitely strong enough to take 350 or even 400 in wrxs with stock block,btohqsg
uhh idk I think it might I'm not a subi owner,btohqsg

Just to add: it has a pink interior too,btohqsg
i guess it is just a girlboss car,btohqsg
In this series  my favourite game was TXR3,btohqsg

"Guy in corner""You filthy peasants  I got a LAMBORGHINI URUS!!""",btohqsg

"How to start a fight during CNY visitingGo up to the Lamborghini Urus that the cousin (that you don't like) just bought and is showing off like a vain peacock  point at it and scream so everyone else can hear""Look Ma  Volkswagen Touareg!!! "" 🤪",btohqsg
"""Bro  why does your Lamborghini Diablo headlights have Nissan logos?""""HERESY!! I SENTENCE YOU TO DEATH""",btohqsg
"The Diablo received a mid-cycle facelift in 1999. Lamborghini simplified the model range by eliminating the ""base"" Diablo (since the SV model had become the new entry-level trim) and applied universal revisions across the lineup. The most immediately noticeable exterior change was the replacement of the previous Diablo's pop-up headlamp units with fixed composite lenses  borrowed under license from their original application in the Nissan 300ZX (Z32).",btohqsg
Basically you can also troll anyone who has Bentayga as well,btohqsg
There are enough videos on YouTube that show that the Urus is basically a VW/Audi parts bin,btohqsg
Not that I think it's a bad thing  it makes the Urus easier to maintain  since it share so many part numbers with VW/Audi,btohqsg
Hi uncle I like your audi alot,btohqsg
Why don't you go settle the bill while I go warm up the JAAAAAGGGGGG,btohqsg

What do yall think of the lexus LFA,btohqsg
WAT?! WAT?! WAT DID U SAY?!I CANT HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF MY GLORIOUS 4.8 LITRE V10 AT 9000RPM DESIGNED BY PIANO COMPANY,btohqsg
It's one of what I consider the last of the old school sports cars,btohqsg
RWD  high rev NA big cc engine. Very analog car,btohqsg
No turbos  no hybrid motors or batteries,btohqsg
don't take it the wrong way  but calling an LFA a sports car lowkey does the LFA a disservice itself 😂,btohqsg
Somewhat flawed  but where it excels  it has no equal,btohqsg
it sold like ass when it came out,btohqsg
sure  extremely well engineered  co-developed with Yamaha and brutally tested on the Nords.,btohqsg
but it has come to a point where every 12 year old jerks off to the thought of it,btohqsg
with a kerb weight of 1.6 tons and a dodgy 6 speed automated manual...?,btohqsg
Actually they made 500 of them only and that is what they sold,btohqsg
don't get me wrong  it is a marvel of a car,btohqsg
but they aren't all THAT great,btohqsg
It was never meant to be a big volume sports cars like the R35 GTR,btohqsg
it never was  but even then it never sold well.,btohqsg
It's a halo car  it actually lost money for Lexus for every unit,btohqsg
It was meant to be a marketing and branding exercise,btohqsg
if anything  the loss of the then-planned Honda NSX was a contribution to the lack of sales,btohqsg
"""We can do this wonderful thing""",btohqsg
the NSX which turned into the HSV-010,btohqsg
the financial crisis played a part too.,btohqsg
It was not the fastest car when it came out  the R35 was faster,btohqsg
as much as one would kill for an LFA now  not many would've want to fork out the amount brand new,btohqsg
it was never about speed really,btohqsg
It was always about getting there fast  looking and sounding good,btohqsg
