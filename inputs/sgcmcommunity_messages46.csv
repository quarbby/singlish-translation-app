Hello everyone  may I know  to your best knowledge  what is the average amount claimed during a vehicle accident (rear-end),btohqsg
Also depends if engine is at the front or back,btohqsg
Anyone ever towed their vehicle from KL to sg,btohqsg
@Jingxunnsir your volvo a bit out of place,btohqsg
Protected by 2 RR in front and a Range R (not in pic) and behind by Ah Bent,btohqsg
what... why all the cool cars and then the rolls and bentley spoil the picture😵‍💫😵‍💫🤔🤔,btohqsg
I rear ended a Honda Freed.,btohqsg
Total claim from passenger + him was 29k sgd.,btohqsg
he didn't thank you for the easy payday ah,btohqsg
I didn’t bother replying me the moment he told me he ok w private settlement  however that’s if I am willing to pay the amount he asked for.,btohqsg
So I told him that I’m sorry  I may be young  but I am not new in this field.,btohqsg
that's bullshit  just let insurance company  do their work and assess if their claim is legit,btohqsg
I told him I bring your vehicle to Kah motors to fix his entire rear portion it wouldn’t even cost that much.,btohqsg
His passenger claim for myalgia was a total of 9000$sgd.,btohqsg
But nice work telling me the following day in the morning that his wife & him were fine  and that he’ll let me know how much the reparations would cost after he got a quotation from them  however till the evening there’s no reply and he subsequently said “oh sorry  my wife and I decided to visit a doctor because we developed pain after waking up”,btohqsg
I then didn’t bother replying him. I told him you got my details  please enjoy the insurance.,btohqsg
I think he probably thought that I am relatively young and that this was his opportunity. That’s pretty sad.,btohqsg
"in other words  ""we googled how to get more money from the other driver and now go keng at doctor""",btohqsg
Well actually I am mostly disappointed because he was almost 2 times my age yet he was unethical after telling me that we can go ahead w/ private settlement,btohqsg
But either way I’ve still done the reporting w/in 24hrs.,btohqsg
you just need to tell them  will let insurance company handle the claim  and will report them to police for fraud,btohqsg
Yup  I subsequently received a TP letter > stating that I am to report to TP as the case is being investigated,btohqsg
That was when I was guessing he probably received 3 days or more of MC.,btohqsg
So guess what? I called the TP IO and he said it was as such. So he said it’s just a small accident he’ll just give me a warning.,btohqsg
Never ask him $290 000 better or 2 900 000,btohqsg
This kind hard to report police for fraud,btohqsg
Because I bang him sure lose case,btohqsg
I banged him on highway when he jammed break all of a sudden (traffic was going slow though),btohqsg
But I had just switched lane and in that 0.5s it was impossible to stop,btohqsg
So oh well  consider it my luck.,btohqsg
But I believe in karma.. he can claim all he want  290k also can.. but I believe someday someone will claim him just like that.,btohqsg
If he drives a mercs I think he’ll be claiming a brand new car,btohqsg
I have a friend that into a Mercedes c180 a couple years ago.,btohqsg
The uncle claimed him privately  but told him that he only repairs his car at the AD (C&C).,btohqsg
And that he needs a substitute car while the car is undergoing downtime.,btohqsg
Can u come and bang my car rear?,btohqsg
Subsequently my friend received a high claim (not exactly sure how much) for the replacement vehicle.,btohqsg
Guess what? The uncle took a Mercedes S class as a replacement vehicle. LOL,btohqsg
I also need a new car,btohqsg
Bang C class claim S class as replacement vehicle,btohqsg
you want him to bang you? 😏,btohqsg
But nicely done  my friend found out after that the uncle works for his father in his company..,btohqsg
So I guess things didn’t turn out super well after..,btohqsg
$29k for that rear knock… more ex than knocking a taxi,btohqsg
Hahaha give me a break bro.. am still young. Need to save my moni,btohqsg
Bruh. That was probably the most ridiculous claim I’ve seen. Based on his damage..,btohqsg
I think knock taxi rear  they only claim $2k,btohqsg
I probably banged him at >30kmh while applying full emergency brake,btohqsg
his whole rear changed to carbon fibre isit,btohqsg
Hang on let me have a look,btohqsg
or isit he and his wife go book 10 session chiropractor,btohqsg
Myalgia > claim 4K (done at private hospital)Transport cost for medical > 300$Legal case > 4.3k,btohqsg
If he asked for insurance claim… the breakdown can be ridiculous,btohqsg
Driver’s claim> neck strain x1 day MC - 4K sgd>medical transport claim > 300$>COST OF REPAIR (most ridiculous) was 8k sgd> replacement vehicle X 13 days > 2.1k sgd> legal cost > 4.3k,btohqsg
His backside like that can claim 8k,btohqsg
I think he claim until engine mount hahaha,btohqsg
This one I need to seek my insurance company’s advise first,btohqsg
That one I think 1-2 days can repair,btohqsg
LOL 1 DAY Mc 4K WHO WANT TO BANG ME NOW,btohqsg
He exports to japan to repair ah,btohqsg
everyday someone bang me for 365 day i whole life no need work alr,btohqsg
He bang u u 1 month don’t need work Aso bro,btohqsg
Claimed me for 4K for 1 day MC,btohqsg
When you guys drive.. be careful. I think there’re a lot of dishonest people in the world.,btohqsg
internal structure might be damaged rear crumple zone might have been impacted,btohqsg
Tell him to come here  we can introduce him for meetup session. $5000/meetup,btohqsg
u go talk to ur insurance company see what they say,btohqsg
If ever *touch wood*  you’re involved in an accident  if you’re really not sincere in doing an honest claim for private settlement  don’t say you’ll settle for private settlement then subsequently go behind their backs and claim insurance,btohqsg
4k a knock i everyday cte jam just slam brake,btohqsg
I may be young  but I have a lot of friends who runs their own workshop.,btohqsg
I know taxi claims are ridiculous,btohqsg
So I know how these kinda things work.. my friends from multiple workshops have advised me accordingly.,btohqsg
So I kinda know he’s trying his luck,btohqsg
bro taxi is fking bad one legit,btohqsg
they claim 1 week mc kind,btohqsg
Whatever it is…. Ur next renewal is screwed,btohqsg
Based on damage  rear crumple zone wouldn’t have been impacted,btohqsg
bro you bang taxi one time 15 mins later 4 taxi drivers  surround you,btohqsg
Because the dent was only on the door. If you know the structure of a freed  you’ll know where the rear crumple zone is,btohqsg
Biggest thing to be thankful for is that I wasn’t hurt  nor was anyone seriously hurt and/or dead,btohqsg
Money can always settle.. money can settle > it’s not a problem..,btohqsg
If money cannot even settle > then I’ll never forgive myself. If I take a live and can never return one > this I’ll never forgive myself,btohqsg
So just a learning point :),btohqsg
money can settle  all you need is  29k,btohqsg
Lucky this guy I bang alr  I straight see if he has PHV sticker hahaha,btohqsg
If he PHV he confirm claim me 2 weeks MC,btohqsg
No problem find until got problem. Say PTSD easy claim.,btohqsg
Then he must be a high pay phv,btohqsg
agreed bro. stay safe and all the best man🫶🫶,btohqsg
I also want to be phv then,btohqsg
Then every day at home shake leg  if he told me he 1 day earn 500$ as PHV driver,btohqsg
I 1 day have to pay him 500,btohqsg
X 13 days vehicle downtime that’s crazy bro,btohqsg
Actually I like talking in here.. cos I feel like it’s always a sharing point,btohqsg
And people are quite engaging here so it’s quite fun,btohqsg
We never know when it becomes our term… so good to share,btohqsg
Bro. 29k sgd no problem.. If you ask me to pay 100k sgd vs a live  I’ll still pay 100ksgd,btohqsg
But hopefully I won’t have to face this,btohqsg
aside from being a mazda+volvo echo chamber everything is fine 😘,btohqsg
Just a pro tip also for u all.. when u all accident etc. some tips to take note of,btohqsg
Bro Volvo the best la say real,btohqsg
i need to promote mazda too,btohqsg
How come they never advice you don't make a report😜,btohqsg
Rmb to participate in our current giveaway! We are giving away 1x Ceramic coating + full detailing worth $400🥳Details are in the pinned message!,btohqsg
Nissan also good  can run even with bald tyres,btohqsg
Haha because this kind of accident  even if I make a report  it’s a bit pointless.,btohqsg
I made a report at my insurance reporting centre  that’s all.,btohqsg
But if I rear end him  there’s really nothing much for me to dispute about,btohqsg
Unless I have evidence that he has ebraked on the road when there’s no obstacle in front of him,btohqsg
Or if I can put a video together to show that he was intentional in causing the accident,btohqsg
Otherwise this kinda accident relatively clear cut,btohqsg
No video camera in ur car?,btohqsg
If you’re prepared to contest the charges  tell your insurance company that you reject the claims  and you + your insurance company surveyor can systematically go through the claims,btohqsg
As long as it is not accepted  they can’t go ahead with the repair anyway,btohqsg
Unless they have some side arrangements with their workshop which would be illegal  all they get is restitution and no cash anyway.,btohqsg
$8k for a 13 day repair job doesn’t sound that crazy to me but I don’t know lah. Me not even a driver. 🤷🏻‍♂️ sounds serious to even need 13 days. Repair back at AD?,btohqsg
That one is true. I’ve seen it happen to my Papa before. Clear cut driver making illegal turn on a non turning lane  turn into my Pa’s car  can write until my Pa was speeding on inner lane in his charade and trying to say it should be 50:50 instead. Some more my Pa so nice. Stopped and asked the lady driver is she is alright and needs ambulance.,btohqsg
$8k repair for Ad repair is possible. I asked for my own damage before and was quoted $10k… but I did the repairs outside for $650,btohqsg
But if he is asking for private settlement  I would expect that the settlement for that knock won’t exceed $2k,btohqsg

Alr got pple csi her on FB lol... she's from kulai not singaporean,btohqsg

Atto 4 is the 1 look like m3,btohqsg
"BYD is trying to target the ""economical"" car buyers",btohqsg
have to see lor  but BYD has made a good impression on me so far,btohqsg
Atto 4 and atto5 is the more premium 1,btohqsg
and very successfully so.  just look at how many more cars they are selling than other makers including Tesla,btohqsg
anyway my boss recently ask me why i always on phone.,btohqsg
