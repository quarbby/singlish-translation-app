North to town is the worst,btohqsg
i have a friend who only spends 60 a month on public transport. he saves alot of money,btohqsg
Even with public transport  my avg mthly cost is abt 120-150,btohqsg
I rather sleep and wake up later lol.,btohqsg
when i go to jewel  i usually would take mrt there. why? parking is too expenisve for many hours.,btohqsg
so i leave the car at home,btohqsg
Haha. Try driving to cbd for parking for 1mth.Can pay your monthly instalment,btohqsg
exactly. that is why i say do not own a car in singapore. it is a lot cheaper and also convenient with public transport,btohqsg
i wont even drive to park in cbd,btohqsg
sometimes i would park my car free in RWS,btohqsg
and then use the trains and buses,btohqsg
and my mother has a RWS card,btohqsg
Rws card need spending to get right,btohqsg
so i take trains to go downtown  suntec  mbfc raffles. no car,btohqsg
Anyone knows if ioniq5 is available for viewing/test drive at PI?,btohqsg
my mother used to go to casino. i have never been inside. you dont really need to spend. you just need to go inside casino.,btohqsg
anyway they give free easily. the car park is too big and not even 1/4 is full,btohqsg
Anyone tried polestar2 already? Whats ur feedback,btohqsg
EV is not just car. it is about the software around it.,btohqsg
Not available. No PI bringing Hyundai cars. Deposit 500 to Komoco Motors for option to purchase by Q4 this year. Fully refundable if you do not wish to proceed during launch.,btohqsg
Heavy  powerful motor even for single motor. Very Volvo like and easy to operate the infotainment. Loved the drive during the test drive. The staff there was also helpful in explaining whatâ€™s better in Polestar 2 compared to Tesla M3.,btohqsg
Haha  have u seen how many bugs on that tablet,btohqsg
So is it more like a car than a electronic car feel? I still prefer the car car kind of car.Tesla interior is crappy build and dont have the all the car-like clusters lol,btohqsg
It feels like a Volvo for sure. But it is a bit small and cocooned in when I first sat in it for driver seat. The back seat is not the biggest but functional.,btohqsg
Ah. Not spacious enough? Seems like a huge crossover on the outside,btohqsg
