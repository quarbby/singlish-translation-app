how u all think im y2 haha ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ask liao all dk.. cuz covid also means their time the slots not fully recovered,btohqsg
Idk bruh it's just the authority of your sentences,btohqsg
Hey its a compliment.. I tryna say u sound like u know what u doing,btohqsg
oh u r that guy haha,btohqsg
i thought u should know im y1 cause itâ€™s in my dc name for the entire month bef i took down after admissions closed haha,btohqsg
I don't put it in my name cuz often ppl ask dumb questions especially for humanities,btohqsg
i know the application process for GEM but not the experience itself bc i got offered a place before covid fucked me lol,btohqsg
GEM it's the NTU exchange program,btohqsg
the other guy was asking about it,btohqsg
History often ppl ask me about historical events which I have no idea and don't study about. Honestly History majors don't just study WW2 and cold War lmao,btohqsg
In fact it's a specialisation to do so and it isn't like secondary or jc History,btohqsg
Yeah. I have to base matching data on 2019,btohqsg
To what do i owe the pleasure,btohqsg
Hearsay 3-5 pu3 retained this yr and they manage to do so cause their Cher spoke up for them apparently,btohqsg
Just do A levels nice nice once and for all lah why must come back to hell again,btohqsg
It's from my GP Cher too and he took pu3 last yr,btohqsg
the thing idgi is why ppl dropout to take As on their own..,btohqsg
like man it isn't 1-2 sub,btohqsg
Oh it happens more often in MI than we think,btohqsg
Some people drop out y2 if they retain to take A levels next year,btohqsg
And then end up failing As,btohqsg
Even the Cher also dk why,btohqsg
Like you retained for a reason...? Then you drop out just to fail...?,btohqsg
Oh ya the one classmate  idl mentioned that,btohqsg
Might as well don't come mi self study as priv cand,btohqsg
MI really has weird people like that,btohqsg
It's just the two letters switcheroo,btohqsg
Missing one h at the end too,btohqsg
Literally 2 pu3 who were  part of CCA exco team dropped out,btohqsg
okay i dont know whats going on with our school but thats cray',btohqsg
even if let's say u did well for As..,btohqsg
the uk sgc personal portfolio how,btohqsg
as someone who graduated from MI,btohqsg
As someone who never did JC/MI you guys are weird lmao and this is coming from someone who had to write NIL on school in my uni application,btohqsg
But did it twice la once in 2021 and then 2022,btohqsg
What qualification you used to enter uni?,btohqsg
I had a tutor for maths and paid for some consults for econs but other than that not rlly,btohqsg
Either ways got S for Maths tho,btohqsg
Self study for As without dropping out from Jc/mi,btohqsg
I thought local uni only accepts ppl who pass all their content subs tho,btohqsg
Like if you fail GP or any one of the 4 content subs instantly canâ€™t get in without another qualification,btohqsg
Eh I didnâ€™t know even H1 content can fail,btohqsg
A pass in all H2 content subjects.,btohqsg
It's a subject wdym cannot fail,btohqsg
I mean like I thought once any of the 4 content subs fail they wonâ€™t even consider the application,btohqsg
Under the 90rp system at least,btohqsg
No in fact u can fail all 4 and it still will be considered,btohqsg
Cuz RP system just requires a good RP,btohqsg
A fail in all defo will get laughed out by Big 3 la,btohqsg
