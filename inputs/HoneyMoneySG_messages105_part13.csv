Hi guys  I have another question for HSBC EGA  once I fulfill the criteria for Everyday+ (i.e. transfer in $2000 and make 5 transactions)  will I get any notification from HSBC that I'm qualified for the Everyday+ Rewards programme? If so is it immediate or need to wait a certain amount of time?,btohqsg

Hello Guys  is XNAP not functioning anymore? Any other apps to use to clock transactions for hawker centres?,btohqsg
Yeah its not been functioning for a couple of days anyone has any idea why,btohqsg
may get sms few days later but even of done get sms will still get 1% rebate starting next day after fulfilling the $2k in and 5 transactions and also the 1% interest,btohqsg
"I see.But just to confirm  transferring in $2k can be via FAST without the need to specifically mention purpose is ""salary payment"" and the 5 transactions can be $1 FAST transfer 5 times yea?",btohqsg
The 1% interest will be applied based on the following formula right:[0.01*(current month MAB - previous month MAB)]*(x/365)Where x is the no. of days in the current monthSo doesn't really matter when you fulfill the 2 criteria as long as its within the calendar month? Correct me if I'm wrong.,btohqsg

Why would transfers affect the earlier dates? Anything after 10:30pm will reflect as next business day.,btohqsg
For current  EGA promo  reference ADB month is Apr. If April ADB is $10k and my May ADB is $50k  I will get bonus interest for incremental ADB of $40k. What abt for June  which will be the reference ADB? Is it $10k? Or $50k?,btohqsg
The promo t&c clearly state the reference month ADB. But the additional 1% p.a. from Everyday+ Rewards is based on previous month ADB.,btohqsg
Does it also apply to Saturdays  Sundays and public holidays?,btohqsg
Saturday is a business day. Sunday and PH is not.,btohqsg
I see  this means that Sunday's and PH's day end balance will follow the previous day's day end balance yea?,btohqsg

@mttelegrammtaunty  there‚Äôs a lobang for you üòÖ,btohqsg

I didn‚Äôt see insurance premiums in the short exclusion list of amex true cashback. Can anyone confirm? Thanks!,btohqsg

Not much difference to outside dental. Some dental clinic got chas card subsidies,btohqsg
I went Denticare  sometimes $72  sometimes $142.,btohqsg
Running low now after i post in group. How many of you got it?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm very grateful for my nice friends here.,btohqsg

Hi gurus. Can anyone advise alternate ways to qualify for OCBC salary bonus if my company is not willing to use giro to credit every month?,btohqsg
Check OCBC 360 website for updated info,btohqsg
I think they added the fast transfer option now,btohqsg
Oh! Yes they updated their website liao,btohqsg
There seems to be an ‚Äúupdate‚Äù beside the salary,btohqsg
So technically you can transfer yourself the salary at the start of the month  and be eligible for the save bonus at the same time,btohqsg
Now for someone to test ü§™ what if it's Corporate PayNow?,btohqsg
Haha then not sure liao. Maybe they  realise their rates better than UOB at 100K so they included this to make it easier for users,btohqsg
wah now 360 also can play ownself pay ownself?,btohqsg
You can test then let us know haha,btohqsg
T&C stated quite clearly that only genuine employment salary credit from employer is eligible. And they reserve the rights to request for any document to verify amount credited is salary.,btohqsg
But for@buzzedgewho's getting genuine salary from company which refuse to pay with GIRO  at least got light for him...,btohqsg
