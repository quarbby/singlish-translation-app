Means the CSO also don't know what she isanswering.LOL,btohqsg
Thks! So possible to use 2 persons strategy like hsbc EGA?,btohqsg
Unfortunately this is not new. üòû,btohqsg
it is actually alternate half yearly.. since the earmark is now 5 months,btohqsg
Welcome to UOB CSO experience. This clearly shows none of them are in this group chat üåö,btohqsg
yes provided your Human B was empty in December 2024.,btohqsg
Ya. HSBC EGA 2 persons strategy still more reliable. üò¨,btohqsg
for my gang  we are going to transfer out everything before January 2025  as we feel not worth it to do UOB One without the earmark promo,btohqsg
UOB One account  in order to enjoy 4% p.a.  you need the $150k to be almost like fixed deposit.. cannot touch at all..NAH.. PASS,btohqsg
May I know where are you parking the funds?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is still giving over 4% for first $360k... and no requirement to keep $360k at all times.. even you keep $10k also can get 4%+ (over reference month ADB),btohqsg
Hi guys any knows if you can set different credit limit for each UOB credit card?,btohqsg
Disclaimer: all strategy is always fluid.. If HSBC EGA cuts their rates to below 4% for January/February cycle.. i will eat humble pie and move back into UOB One at 4% p.a.no loyalty no shame.. follow the money,btohqsg
Within bank is shared credit limit.,btohqsg
Why do u need to do that?,btohqsg
and to share  i am using SCB Esaver as the 'holding account' for the 1-2 days across New Year holiday and clarity on January 2025 interest rates.the Esaver Marathon is still paying 2.85% and 2.9% p.a. respectively for December and January ADB.,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a rewards cap for every credit card I have. Like UOB preferred plat is only 1.1k limit,btohqsg
vs keeping:1. HSBC EGA which could end up earning 02. UOB One which coudl end up earning peanuts if you decide to move out in first few days January 2025,btohqsg
Some ppl will say put with me better. Some ppl includes: meüåöüåöüåö,btohqsg
Hi  can I still get tax relief if I top up for my spouse?She is working in 2024 and earn more than 4/8K.,btohqsg
Hello all  what is the best bank acc with highest interest rate atm?Currently on UOB one  which is 4% interest capped at 150k,btohqsg
Only DBS can set limit for each card  HSBC/AMEX can set individual credit limit.,btohqsg
Noted  will do in March  thanks üôè,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 will a few criteria to fulfull if u have 100k. 150 k for uob one,btohqsg
Thank you  will explroe that out,btohqsg
is there a difference in which bank to use for ssb?,btohqsg
i have measured and confirmed SCB Esaver's calculation methods.I am not that confident with CIMB interest calculations.That being said  SCB is also where I have set up my Transfer infrastructures so it is easier.,btohqsg
CIMB have sample in their TnC  the rate is higher than SCB,btohqsg
i remember their wordings got issue one..haha.. last day vs month...,btohqsg
"and... of course CIMB is famous for..""Officer will call you back for verification""... i kenna myself b4",btohqsg
not sure if you recall a while back there was confusion where CIMB TNC published wordings that implied..bonus interest is paid on the balance on a certain date.. (of course anyone with a brain won't believe it).. but it was worded as suchyou can have $1 in the entire month and keep $100 000 on last day of the month.. and you get paid bonus interest on $100 000,btohqsg
anyway it is just holding for a few days..2.9% vs 3.3%(?) won't matter too much... confidence and ability to complete movement smoothly is key,btohqsg
I don't have confidence in the bank haha. Not gonna risk for that bit of extra interest. ü§™,btohqsg
didn't wanna say this aloud but i agree.,btohqsg
Hahaha I wouldn't go as far to say they're cunning  but just tricky. People may feel otherwise.,btohqsg
Hi guys  seeking some advice.. are those retirement plans useful? Say I pay premium for 10yrs n wait till I reach 55 to get monthly fixed n unfixed payout for another 10yrs.. feel like this plan is long wait so not sure worth the dollars,btohqsg
Is there any recommended money exchange for good HKD rate exchange?,btohqsg
these are only useful if you don't have the discipline to regularly save and invest yourself.the biggest problem is the big fat commissions you pay to the agent (the commission comes from your principal),btohqsg
So you want to do the hard work and learn for yourself. Or you want others to do for you?,btohqsg
Also like I got to keep this policy close to 20yrs to start payout.. and the payout also from my principal.. long run like not earning much,btohqsg
never believe the PROJECTED cash valuealways look at GUARANTEED cash value,btohqsg
My last experience with CIMB promo is all smooth  interest received as published,btohqsg
you never kenna Transfer out frozen until officer calls you back?that was a bad enough experience for me,btohqsg
Yes yes .. I learnt my lesson before! Guaranteed money back is ard 20k after a close to 30yrs policy,btohqsg
You can Google money changer Singapore that's what I use,btohqsg
Hi üëã quick question: if one has <$100k   between 360 vs UOB One   which bank account would be recommended?,btohqsg
Depend if u can fulfill the criteria of both bank,btohqsg
I would recommend HSBC EGA and one of the 2 accounts if you can get at least 3% p.a EIR on either (UOB One is easier  but OCBC 360 may get higher than 3% p.a.).,btohqsg
Id say use interest calculators on uob and ocbc website. It will be the easiest way to compare.,btohqsg
Hi all- for tiger broker exisitng user promo.. can I just transfer in to get the 6.8% of coupon and transfer out once coupon is credited?,btohqsg
