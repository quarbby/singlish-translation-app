But it was really loud? U sure it wasnt Dev lancer?,btohqsg

Intake alone doesnt make a ton of noise,btohqsg
Noise is 30% muffler 70% decat,btohqsg
It coule be the i-vitec + intakeðŸ˜ŒðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Unless u are at 5k rpm vtec is not in the picture ya,btohqsg
Unless some pipe below has a hole who knows,btohqsg
If ur exos is stock and still loud its likely straight through,btohqsg
Either decat and operated or hi flow,btohqsg

Im guessing roi can differentiate exos and intake noises,btohqsg
