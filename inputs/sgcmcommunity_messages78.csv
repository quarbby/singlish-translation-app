You should be able to get good fc,btohqsg
If you have enough dough  no issues,btohqsg
One for every day of the week,btohqsg

i enjoy the A4.8 but the Q7.231 also nice,btohqsg
i agree with jeremy clarkson though the b7 rs4 is great,btohqsg
YA but the B7.428 like abit no point,btohqsg
I prefer the c6 rs6 with the 5.0 V10,btohqsg

sg got more than one 4.0,btohqsg

But the model gen codes also next level,btohqsg
Thank you for making this simplified \ (•◡•) /-R,btohqsg
Ah yes  964 Carrera RS true beauty,btohqsg
Absolutely  964 will be the dream haha,btohqsg
IDK BUT THE 2.0 AT SGCM GOOD ENOUGH,btohqsg
Stage 1 the 2.5 faster than 4.2 R8 even w awd,btohqsg
What about the 992.2 gen 3 AMG line  spec 2 RS,btohqsg
I read 992.2 idw read anymore-R,btohqsg
wah his new hse damn sick sia,btohqsg
got a 911 chassis inside on display,btohqsg
funfact: Porsche made the W124 500E. The Mercedes W124 was meant to be a executive car with a 3.0L I6 engine to be placed neatly and perfectly without too much room to spare. W124 obviously had other 4 Pots like the 2.2L and 2.0L. The less premium 300E was the downsized E280. Just so happened  the W124 came with the same generation 5.0L V8 from the 500SL. There was actually a high demand for the 5.0L V8 in a W124 further down the production years so Mercedes decided to grant their customer's wish and put the V8 into the W124. However  the 5.0L V8 was too huge for the W124 and Mercedes engineers couldnt fit the it in  hence they recuited the engineers at Porsche to help them with the application of the 5.0L V8 in the W124. Porsche engineers had to cut up the front to make it wider so that the engine could fit and for a balanced driving dynamics  the rear was widen too. Therefore the 500E was actually a totally different chassis compared to the W124 we see on our roads. Sadly  the 500E never made it into Singapore as all were made in LHD.And so thats the story on how Porsche actually made a Mercedes!!,btohqsg
very interesting though  this is a Slantnose bumper,btohqsg
But they didn't convert the whole thing to a slant nose,btohqsg
sorry please enlighten  X50 is a powerkit,btohqsg
i mean the kit doesnt come w a new bumper,btohqsg
The car threw me off at first  thought it was a 964 but the signal lights gave it away,btohqsg
this migjt be a slant nose,btohqsg
behind the door panel there is a vent... there are present on slant nose,btohqsg
Not for the 918 spyder and p1 hahaha,btohqsg
if u can own one  i think petrol no need care one,btohqsg
bro  honestly at this point anything you tell me I also will believe you.-R,btohqsg
Best blend of performance  sound and weight. V10s too heavy  v12 too high pitched,btohqsg
if you have the plate  go check LTA LOL,btohqsg
Exactly. So many types of V8  screaming V8  rumbling V8  unreliable V8  multi purpose V8,btohqsg
But the fuel tank placement is accurate to a regular 930,btohqsg
so its a slant nose convert,btohqsg
Not similar to the R8 V8 tho,btohqsg
V12 high pitched sound hits different. But I agree with v8s being the best overall package,btohqsg
eh stop throwing random numbers HAHAHHA-R,btohqsg
Its more of a a R8 V10 without 2 cylinders,btohqsg
I will not express my opinion,btohqsg
Because I believe I will surely be thrown out of the chat or attacked by lovers of a certain car,btohqsg
I think SG too small for turbo,btohqsg
sat in a C4S and Turbo multiple times,btohqsg
even the C4S is abit too powerful,btohqsg
no fun one u step 3 seconds u at speed limit liao,btohqsg
If I'm going for the driving pleasure  rwd it is,btohqsg
thats why you should buy an Aveo5 Manual,btohqsg
C4s to get launch and drag times or you go for a turbo S for that,btohqsg
Floor also cannot reach speed limit,btohqsg
why put 10 down when you can put 0,btohqsg
I stop following ferraris after the 488. Just a pipe dream  might as well dream about the halo cars hahaha,btohqsg
Your civic no fun cause no spoiler,btohqsg
A car is still a car,btohqsg
Yup different one from the rs5 and r8 v8,btohqsg
Ok  why don't you get a vios?,btohqsg
R8 V8 was really nice haha,btohqsg
Thinking of it for a daily if I ever gonna get a v8,btohqsg
Damn it has reached 17k?! I was just looking at a 17k depre m5,btohqsg
Turbos are monsters. Too much power kinda spoils the fun for me.,btohqsg
I assume u are a balboni fan too,btohqsg
Got one ya ya selling his civic 2.0A for 17k depre,btohqsg
u paid for the gauge must use finish,btohqsg
My wallet will cry if I drive a v8 from bukit batok to bedok everyday,btohqsg
i tell u not funny one,btohqsg
bro my bicycle down the hill alr 1bar confirm,btohqsg
Not particularly but I might agree with some of his ideologies,btohqsg
me trying to find ur sense of humour,btohqsg
Good price to experience a r8 once in a lifetime. May not be the best  in fact could be the worse  but can still sound quite brutal and still looks good for its age.,btohqsg
haha imo completely different. R8 has a much wider stance  much more comfortable interior etc,btohqsg
it feels more relaxed in the R8,btohqsg
😱 sick price for a vr6  its a legend but its no v8 lol,btohqsg
personal experience la haha  S5 just get 3.0,btohqsg
Technically this BMW got Mercedes also,btohqsg
Tf.... not even a type r?,btohqsg
U referring also referring to valentino balboni? Haha,btohqsg
Haha still a monster. I prefer something that i can drive to the limits,btohqsg
Then get a base model civic,btohqsg
And floor also wont hit 100,btohqsg
Sorry i meant to say v8. Not r8 hahahah,btohqsg
didn’t know arnav was into philosophy,btohqsg
There is a reason why the 3.0 is 15k depre lol,btohqsg
Can get a megane rs and still got change,btohqsg
When the world needed you the most  you vanished,btohqsg
All the porsche talk is making feel inadequate lol,btohqsg
And also nobody asked but my dream porsche garage would beCayman rCayman gt4991 rs 4.0997 gt2rsAnd of course the 918,btohqsg
Nobody asked but why you still say,btohqsg
Must flex my limited porsche knowledge,btohqsg
i also want say my dream porsche garage now,btohqsg
Wow speedster. I recently saw the boxster speedster,btohqsg
no worries  wait for full loan boys to realise they need to sell at loan settlement price,btohqsg
then you can finally make the leap of faith,btohqsg
That would be a hike in the price,btohqsg
must make sure no boost tho😜😜,btohqsg
This'd probably be my last na,btohqsg

what’s y’all de favourite porsche colour,btohqsg
mine is crayon  miami blue  viper green and yellow,btohqsg
i forgot what the yellow called idk or if it even has a name,btohqsg
But I love ruby stone red  pastel orange  Miami blue  acid yellow (on 918)  gt silver  Sapphire blue,btohqsg
Ruby star is probably my least fav color,btohqsg
After seeing the Carrera GT done in the colour I really fell in love with it,btohqsg
All of us forgot about the Carrera GT,btohqsg
I believe in being able to stay alive to drive the cars hahaha,btohqsg
unpopular opinion but i also don’t like rubystone red,btohqsg
But best Merc ever is the,btohqsg
But the engine is just so good,btohqsg
The sound is really up there,btohqsg
I think you on the wrong brand,btohqsg
Liquid silver metallic is great too but only available on the 918,btohqsg
US$60000 option at the time of spec,btohqsg
It’s a great colour for sure,btohqsg
And they use your car for buying lunch,btohqsg
And you never get the same finish,btohqsg
Just that you could get it at kaki bukit,btohqsg
