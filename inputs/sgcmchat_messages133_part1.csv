Them JDM are old as heck  it can fall apart,btohqsg
sometimes  opinions that don't benefit others should be kept unspoken,btohqsg
sure it might be fucking ugly and shit,btohqsg
but it's someone's pride and joy,btohqsg
shitting on them makes you feel better,btohqsg
but there are real fucking owners paying for them  something you aren't doing,btohqsg
why u pressed over someone saying smthg,btohqsg
eh  whatever helps make our community better,btohqsg

Making the community better by not letting people voice their opinion bro,btohqsg

I like SportCars  you like JDM  canâ€™t I voice my opinion out just like how you did for JDM?,btohqsg
when did i voice out abt jdm,btohqsg
just because you like apple doesn't mean samsung is a pile of shit,btohqsg

997? that is *the* perfect one.,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the hype on that car?,btohqsg
when you get in one you'll understand,btohqsg

"""auto is faster than manual""wait till he tries the fucking W201 auto lol",btohqsg
with technology advancing like my pubes,btohqsg
that is one sentence i never thought  would read but ok,btohqsg
said this to a few friends  but i tried an A45S back to back with an FD2R,btohqsg
but all the shits and giggles were had in the FD2R,btohqsg
every tunnel you just let the revs creep to the 5k crossover,btohqsg
we went just over the limit with the FD  driver and i fucking smiles everywhere,btohqsg
A45 launched at every other light,btohqsg
ironically A45S has worse comfort than FD2R,btohqsg
Newer merc seats aren't very comfortable,btohqsg
i think the car was decently broken in but errrrr,btohqsg
you can really feel every bump  even on the highway,btohqsg
the FD was on BCBR coils  highway it felt very smooth.,btohqsg
And arguably has the best steering feedback and track suspension from factory out there,btohqsg
tbf they came out with the ST,btohqsg
