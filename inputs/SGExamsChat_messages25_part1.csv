It depends on what the opinion is and the circumstance,btohqsg
Im not saying im not hearing one's rationale,btohqsg
Lockdown is worse than what u think,btohqsg
Cant expect food supplies to randomly spawn like netherworld creatures in minecraft,btohqsg
lets see what happens in 10 days,btohqsg
Obviously we don’t lock down forever,btohqsg
Cases increase at a rate that hospitals can deal with thanks to social distancing and contact tracing measures,btohqsg

Tbh idgaf abt the economy niw,btohqsg
Humans aren’t going to die just because we don’t lock down,btohqsg
But i dont see a reason to lockdown despite such a surge,btohqsg
If u wanna blame the surge  thank the UK for herd immunity measures towards coronavirus,btohqsg
SG is trying to apply the flattening the curve strategy,btohqsg
So that even if more cases do occur because we didn’t lock down,btohqsg
They occur at a manageable rate,btohqsg
So that we can keep both our economy and our humans,btohqsg
But it’s a plan  at least,btohqsg
tbh sg is relatively a small country as compared to larger countries such as Msia so I really do believe that our govt can cope,btohqsg
but then again  social responsibility is really really impt,btohqsg

The thing is  u are just generating a sweeping statement without a stand,btohqsg
I could say the same to you,btohqsg
it's really the way you guys interpret the tone of the message,btohqsg
Ppl who truly campaign for one in singapore are rly dumb,btohqsg
Is just that most singaporeans rly lack critical thinkingNot saying is wrong to have differing opinions  but whether such a derived opinion to begin with is rational or not.,btohqsg
