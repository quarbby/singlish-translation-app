When your left arms is weaker than your right arms,btohqsg
Just exercise the weaker side more?,btohqsg
Until it catches up with the stronger side?,btohqsg
Well that's technically a solution too,btohqsg
You can't have distinct weaker and stronger side anymore,btohqsg

Is to pick up lighter weights,btohqsg
