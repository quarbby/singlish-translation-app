Which is painful cuz SIM not subsidised,btohqsg
i cant wait for term test to end next week,btohqsg
from what i understand most of my class has a average of 2.8,btohqsg
and i know someone with the same gpa as me,btohqsg
Most polys average GPA is 2.8 range,btohqsg
I mean you might be used to paying a kidney for school fees but most Singaporeans aren't ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Engineering the GPA is always lower,btohqsg
Even NUS and NTU help u by lowering the GPA required also,btohqsg
bro came to chem eng and cannot math,btohqsg
Then a part time degree might actually be more applicable,btohqsg
PT SUSS is cheaper from a Singaporean perspective,btohqsg
I mean he has a job to cover it but most don't wanna pay the high sticker price too.,btohqsg
Never said it wasn't I did Alevels and Poly concurrently,btohqsg
i think the reason why my parents expectation may not have much expectation on me is because of their backgrounds,btohqsg
both never finished secondary school  both dropped out of secondary 4,btohqsg
I never said it wasn't just that public sector a Public Uni is more advantageous,btohqsg
but now im from a average middle income household,btohqsg
My point is there is better alternatives in public unis instead,btohqsg
Even if he was a Os person,btohqsg
my father work till  16 called up for NS  entered srve as spf..came out work and save up moeny to get a private O and Private A degree,btohqsg
Public Unis most of the board don't give a shit which major,btohqsg
Diploma u go in at a lower level than Degree holders,btohqsg
My mother work and partied around till 21..started private O levels  graduated work till both my father and mother met at 25,btohqsg
And it's usually technician jobs for Diploma,btohqsg
Degree u get in at executive level,btohqsg
then...when i was around 5-6 yrs old  my mother's income improved cause she went for private A and degree,btohqsg
Yeah with the current world it's a death sentence,btohqsg
this was back in the 90s  a Degree was not common,btohqsg
Yeah then I gotta ask.. what's the relevance as its current times we are discussing?,btohqsg
if i wanted to  i can still find a way to create a life for myself,btohqsg
You could but ones prospects would be limited,btohqsg
but from what i understand the prospects being opened to ppl who have a degree...per say  does not intrest me whatsoever,btohqsg
I also knew a handful of them most went back to education,btohqsg
Yeah.. so what u wanna do lol?,btohqsg
^ probably easier for engineering but still it's hell,btohqsg
i have no idea..hence why im going with the flow,btohqsg
and see where it leads me,btohqsg
Yeah that's concerning to say the least tbh u gotta have at least a near term goal,btohqsg
But ngl it's not my problem,btohqsg
i mean that is getting a diploma,btohqsg
if you are talking about poor  ive been there,btohqsg
It isn't even a goal a near term goal is what to do immediately after,btohqsg
Cuz rn you have a high ass chance to get a Diploma it's almost set for u alr,btohqsg
uh get diploma serve my ns,btohqsg
then spend the 2 yrs and decide where i wanna go,btohqsg
You are not understanding my point are you. If its almost certain that event is gonna happen then there's no need to set a goal at that,btohqsg
i mean i do agree having a direction is important but what he said after of using the time in ns to figure it out isnâ€™t invalid,btohqsg
the reason why i said ns is because  i always set my sights to serve the nation,btohqsg
True I guess but anyways it ain't my problem to worry on but in this case that would just be delaying rather than a goal,btohqsg
just want to see if im capable enough to continue after ns,btohqsg
