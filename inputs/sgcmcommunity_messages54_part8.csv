when it has gone up 4x to correct  30% is still a strong up,btohqsg
No. I would proudly bring out and flex every meet. Whether car or watch 🤓🤓,btohqsg
Just a dream for me 🛏,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/ElGrFT2o3YYthis is close to our hearts,btohqsg
cun bo. people bet on shares always talked about they won  they never mentioned what they lost,btohqsg
i thinik i saw a supra,btohqsg
SPA is a nice and real fast racing circuit,btohqsg
Yes sir. Makes me really happy to see it in action.,btohqsg
For a while there were some nay sayers about that car when it was first launched,btohqsg
this one cannot be gt4. it is meant for some rally,btohqsg
any 2nd hand under 150k i shall  buy  cash and carry no sweat,btohqsg
That and next year’s GR Corolla,btohqsg
😆😆this one has to wait...nobody will sell me 2nd hand next year,btohqsg
this kind of car is for play. it is not comfortable at all. not for touring or long distance,btohqsg
l;ike the suzuki gti. hard and rocky,btohqsg
Enthusiast car. Xmm will say… zhng Corolla nia. Dryyy,btohqsg
No sweat for you lah. Buy new. First on road. FLEX Game Strong!! 💪🏼,btohqsg
i cheap skate  buy people new one,btohqsg
Back to purchase reason mah. Like how people can daily their Elise 😊😊,btohqsg
haha but yaris the production run so limited so harder to get our hands on,btohqsg
“You do you” hahahahaa. I personally think I will prefer the proportions of the Corolla especially after seeing the Yaris irl,btohqsg
to each their own  looks will always be subjective,btohqsg
Not sure if you will fit in the back sir 😅,btohqsg
oh😂😂 i mean its a second/third car right,btohqsg
Eh eh the regular Yaris is a fam car for some hor,btohqsg
But yeah the GR then yeah,btohqsg
Min 2nd car although I can imagine it would be a fun daily,btohqsg
Watch the videos until I 🤤,btohqsg
I mean... imagine getting stuck in a 2hr jam (likeSSexperienced yesterday) with tht manual trans... no need leg day for the whole week already,btohqsg
I have leg day everyday sir as you know 😅😅,btohqsg
toyota is going in the right direction for their GR line... cant say so much for the rest of the cars,btohqsg
thats y buy cheap  definitely not daily car. its the 2nd or 3rd car,btohqsg
they can take my money even if it’s slow,btohqsg
Good luck with that sir  no dealer is willing to sell anything to you unless you can drive their billing up for now and purchase multiple watches and build a relationship,btohqsg
Because they know the resale value and the limited supply that Rolex has created under the pre tense of pandemic production cuts,btohqsg
World first GR Camry sighted on the road already leh! 😉,btohqsg
I'm not a watch collector lmao. That's alright. All i use is a samsung watch,btohqsg
The only way for a common person to buy these would be resellers and sites like chrono24  direct from Rolex can only get a few models that they got a lot of,btohqsg
But they won’t tell you they have a lot of those. They will say “OH there is a very long queue for that  but if you pay the PREMIUM over retail price  I can see what I can do for you”,btohqsg
Hahha me too! But now diving into market research around watches. Fun to see what the market trends are and see what the various watch makers are doing,btohqsg
But in Singapore  from what I've seen. Most authorized dealers will shoo you away if you suggest paying a premium. Instead they would urge you to purchase more watches from other brands they are the authorized dealers for as well,btohqsg
i use my army watch... drill into dashboard of my car so that can mimmick IWC in mercs😈😈,btohqsg
Hmmmm my pasar malam casio got use le,btohqsg
