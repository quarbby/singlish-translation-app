When they charge in court  driving without license is always bundled together with driving without insurance,btohqsg
Reminds me of a old court joke. So a lawyer insures his cigars  a comprehensive insurance covering among other things  fire damage. Months go by  he submits a claim for his insured cigars claiming that it was lost in a series of small controlled fires.The insurance company refuses and rejects the claim arguing that clearly the lawyer had smoked them.The lawyer sues the insurance company for recovery as fire damage is listed as an insured event for his cigars.He goes to court and wins the case so the insurance company pays off the lawyer  the insurance company also has him arrested for Arson.,btohqsg
Yes you can drive without a license  whether it's legal or not is another qns,btohqsg
