for us was pre-covid so it was so fun HAHA,btohqsg
Play games etc  gym  hang out,btohqsg

Why ask for permission why u can just sneak in clas,btohqsg

nah we dont wanna sneak it in,btohqsg
we respect this tutor a lot cause he's very nice ah so our class ppl like having him,btohqsg
btw quick qn  for poly students are cca points etc important,btohqsg
I only got 40 points so far and I have 2 more years to accumulate  my target is 80,btohqsg
The best moments of CCA was in secondary school,btohqsg
for my cca  we need to sing etc ah,btohqsg
I also join programmes in sch etc volunteering events,btohqsg
I join after noon lessons with my teacher,btohqsg
Yeah i think its good chance to earn points lor,btohqsg
When the leaders actually lead with passion and not just for portfolio in hopes of getting to university,btohqsg
Its also good to network with ppl in sch!,btohqsg
maybe diff env from then n now ba,btohqsg
Ah  yes  that moment of studying in void of CCA when you're in the graduating year of secondary school,btohqsg
Well  which CCA were you from  kid?,btohqsg
I joined chorale for 6 years,btohqsg
Ah  yes  how could I forget,btohqsg
reminds me of the escooter song,btohqsg
As long as u meet the right Cher,btohqsg
Also  assuming you can complete papers on time,btohqsg
I’m a disappointment to my ss Cher probably,btohqsg
Same  guess who failed combined Humans at O,btohqsg
Oh  oops  I thought you hurt yourself or something,btohqsg
they use the tape all the time,btohqsg
I felt damn bad after my ss prelims,btohqsg
It's okay  in life we'll probably die before finishing certain things,btohqsg
I changed the language and the guy exaggerate so much,btohqsg
DAMN LOUD SOMEMORE WHEN I ON VOL 8 Only on the tv,btohqsg
It's a possibility we could face,btohqsg
I changed to Japanese before but I dont understand,btohqsg
Why are some Americans upset that Naomi Osaka chose to represent Japan?,btohqsg
I have no idea  I didnt read about this. I watch badminton only,btohqsg
Yallz  If someone I like ask where I go,btohqsg
what kind of funny replies shld I try,btohqsg
Is anyone here a poly student who is going to internship or had gone for internship?,btohqsg
I am wondering what kinds of questions the interviewers would ask during interview?,btohqsg
If I'm not a poly kiddo can I still ans,btohqsg
Cuz u get to learn alot of new things and make new friends and connection,btohqsg
Hey guys just a qn due tocovid what do yall do inur freetimesss,btohqsg
- Weakness / Strength- How can u help the company- Where do you see yourself in xx years?- How do you think the company will help you to where you are- Why you wanna join them?,btohqsg
Oh I seeThen would they ever ask about my GPA result  which I did not put in my resume?,btohqsg

Mostly channel 8  especially at 9pm,btohqsg
Ouh damn didnt know ppl still watch chnl 8,btohqsg
Used to be a past time,btohqsg
Why should we hire youWhat do you know about usWhat are your strengths and/or weaknessesHow will you handle conflict in your workplaceAre you a meticulous or big-picture personOther questions specific to the job role eg have you done this and that before,btohqsg
So far for both intern and job interviews I got asked those,btohqsg
For job interviews  mostly asked about past experience,btohqsg
Usually they won't ask unless they asked during application process,btohqsg
hmmm Idk what are u studying now so i can’t comment. But yes  some companies do,btohqsg
I have one more question regarding the interviewWould they ever ask about my O level results  especially English language?,btohqsg
nah not really. Actually is also about the way you structure your reply back  if your english is not good  why not just tell them honestly and say that you are doing xxx to improve it and hope to improve further by xxxx,btohqsg
Not really if you've done some English language-related thing for poly,btohqsg
For some reason  only governmental roles tend to look into your past results even if you have something that is of higher qualification,btohqsg
So far I don't think I've submitted O level results for most of my applications and no one asked,btohqsg
HAHA sry not refering to u,btohqsg

Hey all. My mom has been issued a quarantine order from MOH. Am I allowed to step out of the house and buy food for her? (I am a household member),btohqsg
Just order food and opt for contactless delivery,btohqsg
ask them to hang at the door and wait for them to go out first,btohqsg
if u need any grocery or anything just order using app and opt for contactless delivery first.,btohqsg
if ur mum kena QO and serving at home  you should have been issued QO as well,btohqsg
either that or your mum shld hv been sent to GQF,btohqsg
She just received a message from Moh saying to stay at home first and wait for a call from Certis,btohqsg
And also to inform close contacts to stay at home,btohqsg
It’s been 7 hours since the message,btohqsg
Close contacts doesn’t always mean households members?,btohqsg
well  that's alws up for interpretation under context  which i have none of,btohqsg
so what i can say is,btohqsg
yeah u need anything just opt for contactless delivery to be safe uh meanwhile take care man.,btohqsg
my bro and dad also kena QO recently,btohqsg
Fam members are NOT restricted by Law  but advised to cut contact from others. Those on QO at home are required to stay in their room of Quarantine till they're moved to QOF,btohqsg
i wonder what are they building on that land between JE MRT and Jcube,btohqsg
Should be the jurong region line part of the mrt,btohqsg
wow they started building that metro line alr ??,btohqsg
Yes. Some of the stations already started construction last year,btohqsg
Then the plot of land you were talking about  they are building the jurong east integrated transport hub with it,btohqsg
Do you think taxis are public transport,btohqsg
U privately hire taxis and this service is not necessarily open to the public once u ride it  unless u share rides,btohqsg
LTA classifies taxis as public transport  although some other sources may say it's not,btohqsg
It ain't no public good though,btohqsg
"But even if public transport got the word ""public"" does not mean it's a public good in the first place",btohqsg
Need to refer to the 2 conditions,btohqsg
How on earth is it a merit good??,btohqsg
y set so low standards 4 yrself,btohqsg
idk if that’s a word but yes,btohqsg
haven’t been doing much work for the past two days,btohqsg

there's your problemtry to pace yourself better if possible,btohqsg
istg if u feel burnt out just rest its ok,btohqsg
go for long walks while listening to music!,btohqsg
Spend more time with family (I would say friends but its harder to do nowadays),btohqsg
I just give up and take a break,btohqsg
"Anyone knows if the shop ""cash converters"" still open for biz?",btohqsg
Also is it normal to learn 4 instruments-?,btohqsg

the talent and patience i don't have 😩,btohqsg
My friend bought a gz ahh,btohqsg
Then I went over last time,btohqsg
i cant rlly spend time with them-,btohqsg
I admire thatpersonally I've played guitar and nothing more  for 4.5yrs at this pointtbh the biggest factor stopping me from learning more instruments is the cost lmaooprobably because I'm uncertain if it would be worth it spending hundreds on completely new stuffbut with guitar related gear I know I can make use of them,btohqsg
I wanna learn electric guitar -,btohqsg
not as ex as a drum kit ahh,btohqsg
everytine people ask me how much my e guitar costI always lie and say its cost 25% of the price I actually paid,btohqsg
your house must be damn big,btohqsg

Come I give you a box,btohqsg
It's like shoe is still a shoe and idk why ppl buy atas shoes,btohqsg
and thats why im not getting a new one,btohqsg

Part one : the hearth and the salamanderClarisse first meeting with montag :“ are you happy ? She said ““Happy ! Of all the nonsense . He stopped laughing”“Of course I’m happy . What does she think ? I’m not ? He asked the quiet room”Mildred suicide 😃👍:“His wife stretched on the bed   uncovered and cold   like a body displayed on the lid of a tomb”“And in her ears the little seashells   the thimble radios ramped tight   and an electronic ocean of sound   of music and talk and music and talk coming in   coming in on the shore of her unsleeping mind ““The object gave a full clink and slid off in darkness”“There was only the singing of the thimble - wasps in her tamped- shut ears   faintly   in and out of her nostrils   and her not caring whether it came or went   went or came ““The small crystal bootle of sleeping -tablets which earlier today had been filled with thirty capsules and which now Lay uncapped  and empty in the light of the tiny flare ““ he felt that the stars had been pulverised by the sound of the black jets and that in the morning the earth would be covered with their dust like a strange snow . That was his idiot thought as he stood shivering in the dark   and let his lips go on moving and moving ““Got so many   starting a few years ago   we had the special machines built “Love test :“I’m still crazy . The rain feels good . I love to walk in it ““I don’t think I’d like that “ he said“I guess it’s the last one the dandelions this year . I didn’t think I’d find one in the lawn this late . Have you ever heard of rubbing it under your chin ? Look “”what a shame “ she said “your not in love with anyone ““Yes I am ! ”“It doesn’t show ““The psychiatrist wants to know why I go out and hike around in the forests and watch the birds and collect butterflies. I’ll show you my collection some day ““And let rain fall into my mouth .it tastes just like wine . Have you ever tried it ?”“How odd . How strange . And my wife thirty and yet you se so much older at times . I can’t get over it ““He tilted his head back in the rain  for just a few moments and opened his mouth “Montag and the hound“A strange rasping combination of electrical sizzle   a frying sound   a scraping of metal   a turn of cogs that seemed rusty and ancient with suspicion ““The growl simmered in the beast and it looked at him”“It doesn’t like me” said montag”“What  the hound ?”Other quotes :“One day it was raining   the next it was clear   the day after that the wind blew strong   and the day after that it was mild and calm   and they day after that calm day was a day like a furnace of summer ““He held his pants out into an abyss and let them fall into darkness “Burning women quotes :“The women knelt among the books   touching the drenched leather and cardboard   reading the girly titles with her fingers while her eyes accused montag ““Where’s your common sense ? None of these books agree with each other . You’ve been locked up here for years with a regular fanned Tower of Babel . Snap out of it ! The people in those books never lived . Come on now ! ““We’re due back at the house . Bedsides these fanatics always try sucide ; the Patterns’s familiar ““His pink face burnt and shiny from a thousand fires and night excitement”Montags talk with Mildred :“ funny   how funny   not to remember where it when you met your husband or wife ““He tried to count how many times she swallowed and he thought of the visit from the two zinc -oxide -faced man with cigarettes in their straight lined mouths and the electronic eyed snake winding down into the layer upon layer of night and stone and stagnant spring water ““And he thought of her lying on the bed with the techinicians standing straight over her   not bent with concern   but only standing straight   arms folded ““The walls were always talking to montag ““The electric thimble moved like a praying mantis on the pillow  touched by her hand . Now it was in her ear again   humming ““The hound   he thought .,btohqsg

It’s out there now   if I opened the window “Montags talk with Beatty :“I’ve seen it all .you were going to call for a night off”“Every fireman   sooner or later   hits this . They only need understanding   to know how the wheels run . Need to know the history of our profession. They don’t feed it to rookies like they used to ““Books cut shorter . Condensations . Digests . Tabloids . Everything boils down to the gag   the snap ending ““Mildred smoothed the bedclothes. Montag felt his heart jump and jump against as she patted his pillow”“Empty the theatres save for clowns and furnish the rooms with glass walls and pretty colours running up and down the walls like confetti or blood or sherry or Sauterne”“A book is a loaded gun in the house next door . Burn it . Take the shot from the weapon . Breach mans mind ““She didn’t wanted to know how a thing was done   but why ““ that’s all we live for   isn’t it ? For pleasure ，for titillation ? And you must admit our culture provides plenty of these ““If you don’t want a man unhappy politically   don’t give him two sides to a question to worry joke; give him one   better yet   give him none”“ we stand against the small tide of those who wants to make everyone unhappy with conflicting theory and thought ““ we let the firemen keep the book twenty-four hours.if he hasn’t burned it by then   we simply come and burn it for him ““Whether we like this or not   we’re in it . I’ve never asked for much from you in all these years   but I ask it now   I pleat for it .
