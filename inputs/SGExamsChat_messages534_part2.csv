I rem I had a crush in sec 4 and during the English olevel paper she was like a seat on the front right of mine,btohqsg
Lol why are we surprised when singaporeans are willing to pay $118k for a piece of paper,btohqsg
all the occasional drivers using the car sharing services all noobs one lol. always see them on mothership roads.sg  sg road vigilante  etc. getting into all kinds of accidents,btohqsg
i got see once. the driver just move out of parking lot alr mount the lot’s kerb lol,btohqsg
Tbhfam aft I got my p-plate I realised why saf has compulsory vehicle cmdr,btohqsg
yeah. drivers are generally stupid tbh. even i experienced several near misses myself thanks to other drivers,btohqsg
why ppl buy car? like if it’s a rare car sure. but normal cars? why cannot lease ?,btohqsg
some stupid person idk how  i was driving on the main road so close to the side road alr and some p-plate driver insist on merging onto the main road and i have to ebrake and swerve my car to avoid crashing into him,btohqsg
u can actually buy COEs w 2 years left,btohqsg
only downside is  canot get leased for first car if uw drive asap after u get license,btohqsg
I think mostly its either for kids or elderly parents who cant get arnd by themselves then they need longer than 1-2 yrs,btohqsg
bc my parents 2 years iirc,btohqsg
idk fam the only reason ppl gave me to own a car was fam,btohqsg
I’m aware that’s why i wondering why ppl buy cars,btohqsg
Ye i just ended p-plate year tdy  I also so far only drive at hrs when ik the traffic is lighter,btohqsg
I mean thats why I hv the p-plate right,btohqsg
Literally its to warn everyone else I got skill issue lol,btohqsg
i just drive during peak hour,btohqsg
yeah but some drivers idk how they got the p-plate in the first place. how did they even pass tp test and drive like that on the roads lol,btohqsg
Oh some tp testers only mark a mistake once,btohqsg
Then others will mark repeat mistakes again for each repeated,btohqsg
like…i think all drivers  even p-plate ones  should know that if there is a car on the main road very close to you  you should not be merging from the side road onto the main road. basic common sense leh,btohqsg
im on carmart..ppl selling a merc the same price as a toyota cause of coe,btohqsg
might as well just keep changing cars,btohqsg
lol risk dying to save 2 seconds,btohqsg
I mean literally all sort of cars...simillar pricing,btohqsg
If coe left <1yr why bother liquidating,btohqsg
can still use as grab vehicle,btohqsg
Ik some ppl strapped for cash but the demand is so ridiculously low,btohqsg
lol tp test alr so lenient. “never check blind spots” free penalty for 2 times. imagine you never check blind spots 10 times but since tp tester only mark once it’s still free and that’s how when the driver eventually get onto the roads  stupid accidents happen lor  caused by bodohs not checking blind spots when merging onto main roads,btohqsg
Tbh my dad keeps telling me to rely on side mirror otherwise I risk swerving,btohqsg
Idt the car swerves that much but he says that,btohqsg
depends on the angle that the side road merges onto the main road i guess  i use either side mirrors  blind spots or both,btohqsg
I check blindspot if side mirror reads inconclusive,btohqsg
let’s say for this road  which i had a near miss caused by a driver from the side road  very hard to rely on blind spots alone  you need to turn your head like 180 degrees lol,btohqsg
I look q far which is why my dad scared I accidentally swerve,btohqsg
so you have to use your side mirrors to see also,btohqsg
oh i hate these type of roads,btohqsg
especially when you got high af barriers on that island,btohqsg
Wait we're taught to check mirrors be4 blindspot wat,btohqsg
I cant see in the pic,btohqsg
Imagine driving at night...you cant even see if there is any car merging into your lane,btohqsg
Shag bro guess I'll stay away frm Eunos roads,btohqsg
So end up all the cars that leave the expressway have to poke their vehicles... pass that zebra crossing,btohqsg
They legit not supposed to stop horh,btohqsg
2 lane merge...into active lanes that they cant see for shit,btohqsg
the outer lane is suppose to merge to the 2nd lane...but then here come the rumbling bus,btohqsg
and block both lanes from even moving,btohqsg
imagine this scenario...what you gonna do,btohqsg
depends lor…if perpendicular your mirrors tell you nothing lol,btohqsg
