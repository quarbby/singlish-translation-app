If they have a elitist mindset and work in a team. More often than not because of their mindsets  you can force them to potray their elitism in their work. The moment it happens  I don't think bosses take kindly to that,btohqsg
Neh my physics memory not that bad to believe tht,btohqsg
Unless I'm not accustomed to the working world but openly showing you are a elitist is never going to help you,btohqsg
The chance of your boss being a elitist is extremely high and I'm very certain a elitist person that talks down on you would not want you to do well in any compacity,btohqsg
Idk if some are like showing double personality,btohqsg

IDK U SAID UR SCH IS THE REAL ELITIST,btohqsg
Its your word against your own,btohqsg
The thought I'm having is that a elitist will always wind up over performing because they constantly want to feed their ego they are better. This in turns them on the spotlight and becomes the target for every more higher up elitist in a company. It's a good chain system no?,btohqsg
Kuro do u think u have an elite background?,btohqsg
Theres people who are elitistthey think that they are the best so they dont try,btohqsg
Doesn't that just make u a civil servant?,btohqsg

And they are real elitist coz i think they more invested in my broâ€™s jc coz his sch more elite than mine,btohqsg
my sister thinks shes doing well but shes not,btohqsg
But bosses only look at two things  their competitors or those that don't try...so either way to a elitist boss  both are going to falter.If you are a elitist and try to size up to bosses  you will become a targetIf you don't try hard enough  the bosses will also target your incompetency,btohqsg
Wiat no she thinks that shes doing better than me,btohqsg
Entrepreneurs aren't failures in any ways even societal views it as sucess lmao,btohqsg

because she says that shes from RI so anytime she doesnt do well for papers it would always be better than me getting an A in EJ cuz RI papers will always be harder than EJ papers,btohqsg
But to be fair  different people have different expectations,btohqsg
Elitist can also be lazy what,btohqsg
So LITERALLY she thinks in ALL circumstances she is better than me,btohqsg
In fact a lot of em are lazy cuz they smart what,btohqsg

laziness is the correct way of life,btohqsg
she used that excuse on me,btohqsg
Both scenarios of someone overperforming and underperforming puts you in the spotlight to become a target for enlitist bosses.Both overperforming and underperforming just also so happens to be traits of a elitist,btohqsg
RGS papers harder than CHS paeprs,btohqsg
So for example if YT retakes A Levels again  puts in even more effort  but his results do not improve  he has reached his actual potential?,btohqsg

I actually did RI chem and phy paper and it was q easy,btohqsg
thats why i say my sis is elitist,btohqsg
That's my base take on elitist people  seem like a close and shut case to me,btohqsg
because she is from RI she thinks she better than everyone,btohqsg
Bro I am too tired and too old for this shit.,btohqsg
