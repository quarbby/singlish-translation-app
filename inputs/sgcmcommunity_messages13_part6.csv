byd provides battery to tesla also right?,btohqsg
haha to each their own.. i would rather a slight less efficient Polestar 2 compared to a Model 3 purely based on design,btohqsg
they have vast suppler for sure,btohqsg
Beg to differ  Mazda is good yes but there are other more engaging or better options out there!,btohqsg
tesla is also making its own batteries,btohqsg
But respect your choice of Mazda!,btohqsg
tesla even make thier own charging station,btohqsg
Definitely. Mazda is not the best,btohqsg
for long distance i take my bmw,btohqsg
no need change transmission fluid how can not be best,btohqsg
bmwâ€™s b58 inline 6 has won two best engine awards leh,btohqsg
No need change anything cos bullet proof,btohqsg
audi is also fast car. but expenisve to maintain,btohqsg
tbh audi volkswagen and porsche all share ea888 so technically all under same grp,btohqsg
if u compare m5 to rs6,btohqsg
audi nice lehh  infotainment all pretty good,btohqsg
Actually similar to BMW and Mercedes,btohqsg
mercedes seems to be the least favorite,btohqsg
It just depends on where you go and how well you take care of it,btohqsg
Check e sgcarmart listing bro  many many,btohqsg
audi is fast in straightline. and in terms of all round capabilities always lose to bmw,btohqsg
but i will just drive my fit and v tec kick in yoz,btohqsg
in germany  they always have this trip battle - bmw audi and mercedes,btohqsg
Bmw interior still very old sch,btohqsg
mercedes interior is best. i love it,btohqsg
yes. i agree. which is stale looking i dont like it. always the same,btohqsg
now the problem is the exterior,btohqsg
sucks i would say. all look similar,btohqsg
old is gold.. wld rather prefer to use the idrive then some of the other brands tht uses a tablet,btohqsg
Audi is a great middle ground between Mercedes and BMW,btohqsg
In terms of interior  driving dynamics  etc.,btohqsg
using a tablet while driving is quite dangerous dont you think  requires the driver to take his eyes off the road,btohqsg
i rate the germans this ways - mercedes  audi and bmw,btohqsg
"Mercedes is always focused on features and ""comfort""  BMW is very driver oriented",btohqsg
Agree old Is gold. But have to advance with tech. Theirs really too basic n simple,btohqsg
obviously i dont wish to go back to the times when there was a whole keyboard on the centre console but ugwimðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹,btohqsg
The new BMWs have pretty good tech actually  just that they maintain a similar look for the familiarity,btohqsg
They still have the new age safety features  ambient lighting  virtual cockpit  etc.,btohqsg
bmw have been nailing their HUD for the past decade!,btohqsg
What advanced feature are you seeking which you feel is missing in BMWâ€™s latest interiors?,btohqsg
Yea the newer ones have ambient n digital display now,btohqsg
2017 onwards already have digital cockpit in some models,btohqsg
Idk. Just the ui of the infotainment system  feels and look old sch compared to newer cars,btohqsg
to each their own haha  i personally dont prefer having a tablet but i am sure other will love the minimalistic look,btohqsg
I think you haven't experienced the new idrive 7 then,btohqsg
I actually feel they have about the best in ui and features. Werenâ€™t they the ones who went with hard disks in cars when all the other makers were still on cd changers?,btohqsg
Also not a fan of tablets myself. Personally dont fancy having to poke a screen for many things. But I agree it is personal and highly subjective.,btohqsg
I dun like tablet  but i want the menu n options to be more interactive. Both ways wld be good. Touch screen n touchpad,btohqsg
I also prefer knobs and buttons for aircon  drive modes etc,btohqsg
you are only hinting to one car... E92 M3!,btohqsg
