hi guys  heard delay for currently building btos will be even more now? cause of migrant workers crunch,btohqsg
Those 98% - 99% completed  anyone has any news from hdb yet?,btohqsg
Hello! As long as i have the HLE letter means my HLE application is approved already ?,btohqsg
approved without the house ready also no use as you'd need to do HLE again before key collection,btohqsg
no and my project dropped from 98% to 83%,btohqsg
I think only after the stage of architectural work has completed  then can anticipate for keys collection,btohqsg
So is not possible to collect keys for those completed block since those 98-99% still hv not,btohqsg
Hmm based on what the HDB staff told me  key collections are based on block completion,btohqsg
The TOP tracker is based on the TOP date of respective projects,btohqsg
We are in the midst of Q2 hope can collect keys after hungry ghost festival,btohqsg
I visited the site almost every week. All those completed... they have blocked out from those still constructing.Crossing my fingers that I collect keys soon.,btohqsg
Because i will need it for the unit selection this month. So not sure whether it is approved or still in process ? üòÖ,btohqsg
If approved  the HLE letter will state the amount u can loan. U may login to HDB website to check,btohqsg
The amounts for 15  20 and 25 years right ? Cause what my friend received was only the 25 years one .,btohqsg
I received containing 15 20 25,btohqsg

I need some advice on the water heater and tap. Hope someone can help shed light on it.As we can see all new HDB comes with wall mounted shower sets with the option of hot and cold water. If we are using a normal instant heater  guess the in built shower set taps will be no difference in whichever direction we turn  right?,btohqsg
Hi guys I have a question. If I use my CPF to pay for the housing  from what I understand is  the Accrued interest that we get from our CPF stops coming in as we have to pay it back ourself if we sell the house. But if let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm not planning to sell the house  when will the AI starts coming back into effect? Isit once the principal sum plus AI are paid back from the CPF deductions?Sorry if this qns has been asked before first time buyer here,btohqsg
No sell house  no accrued interest.,btohqsg
What's coming in and coming back?,btohqsg
As long as you're not planning to sell your house can heck care the AI,btohqsg
Like example if I use the cpf to buy the house  the AI from cpf stops as we took out cpf money. Then if u sell somewhere down the years later u need to pay back the principal loan amount plus the AI over the years before the AI from the government starts to come back into effect right ? Cos all the loan amount plus the AI u suppose to get is paid back already.But if you don‚Äôt intend to sell at all. Will the AI that you get from not touching ur CPF in the first place come back once u paid finish the loan amount + interest of the say 25 year loan? Or like the AI won‚Äôt have ever till u sell it,btohqsg
