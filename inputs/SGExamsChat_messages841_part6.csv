My campus gets about 1Gbps on M1,btohqsg
I mean really good it‚Äôs faster than my wifi at home üíÄ,btohqsg
But in terms of latency it‚Äôs not good,btohqsg
It‚Äôs even more worse than playing Valorant with SingTel Fibre,btohqsg
Even tho the servers are powered by SingTel they‚Äôre ping is horrendous,btohqsg
i dont understand the difference aside from the price,btohqsg
One has 180 Days of validity,btohqsg

long story short  to create compeititiveness,btohqsg
I wld think its the FTC wanting to split search from google,btohqsg
What is there to compete with,btohqsg
Most browsers still use chromium like brave and opera,btohqsg
I think i have 5g but i never really notice,btohqsg

If they seperate the search engine from googles other business,btohqsg
Maybe google might develop their own search engine,btohqsg
If chrome gets sold off opera and brave need to make their own search engine and stuff,btohqsg
If it gets sold of the buyers will take advantage and make it closed,btohqsg
They dont need to make their own search engine per say,btohqsg
Btw this is the rule google broke,btohqsg
I mean the code is already there,btohqsg
i did not even realise this rule was a thing...imagine owning a business that dominates two diff industries..and you get charged with a crime because of it,btohqsg
"Them ""closing"" it wld just mean their branch of development is their own? I think",btohqsg
People can just fork the pervious version of it,btohqsg
