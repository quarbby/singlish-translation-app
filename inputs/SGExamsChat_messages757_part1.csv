might as well go work fnb,btohqsg
u go work uniqlo u get >$10/h u get discount on clothes,btohqsg
oh btw tatabusa told me to teach little pri sch kids art and craft so they'll come to me for tuition when they are older,btohqsg
Do u think consulting/commodities trading/ fx/equities trading is parasitic?,btohqsg
skillz doesn't mean it adds value to society,btohqsg
Thing about group tuition is if the tutor wants to charge more for overrunning but most of the student doesn‚Äôt want to pay more it‚Äôs not fair  the student can‚Äôt just leave the class at the scheduled end time cos by the time they come back for the next lesson they would be behind their peers,btohqsg
Cuz be always overrun to 1pm,btohqsg
But then he advertise as 2h,btohqsg
Do uw a pic of tatabusa,btohqsg
eh u want tuition ah i can give u channels,btohqsg
anyway if anyone knows ppl who need help with olvl Chinese dm me pls üôè,btohqsg
He could have ended at 2h and say he wants to add an optional additional lesson lol  but good for his students if they get extra time,btohqsg
consulting depends  trading & banking by itself not necessarily  but perhaps made so because of what the ppl do with the money,btohqsg
He doesn't care abt the money I'm guessing,btohqsg
Also cuz tbf the content he covers,btohqsg
bankers make our world go round,btohqsg
Ah ic anyway with that many students he can earn a decent amount alr,btohqsg
He buys gp essays from people to repurpose for notes,btohqsg
I mean I consulted for energy comapnies just to find target markets/ countries with less laws to exploit Labour there..,btohqsg
traders just make money in the market without affecting others,btohqsg
Or pays people to write gp essays,btohqsg
At least unlike sugarusque no plagiarism,btohqsg
Isn't trading a zero sum game,btohqsg
If someone sold him an essay from KS bull,btohqsg
well that's not rly on you that's on the country with lax regulations,btohqsg
you're using the system as it's designed,btohqsg
and im looking at my own society,btohqsg
Actually idk but if he says who wrotes them should not be,btohqsg
More like theirs regulatiosn for fa and prop agents but they don't follow the regulations,btohqsg
Like how excel and PowerPoint are not allowed,btohqsg
ya  if you make a fuck load of money from me because im dumb and don't know how to trade  that's on me because of wtv reasons n market forces and wtv bs  in a free market i don't know who i lost money to  i only know i lost moneyFAs affect others because they knowingly use their words and sales tactics to get ppl to pay more money for something that might not be beneficial,btohqsg
And not disclosing of the fees,btohqsg
At least when my brother marks GP essays he would separate language errors from content errors. So he would highlight stuff like spelling/grammar/sentence structure and issues with the logic/examples,btohqsg
Had one fa pitch me aia ilp but nvr mention the 3.9% fee and 1.5% fee on underlying funds,btohqsg
But i got to eat kbbq for free lol,btohqsg
if it's an industry norm to not follow regulations  u either follow the trend or u die,btohqsg
or u join the regulators and figure out a way to up enforcement,btohqsg
But then the fa friend told me 90% dun read the contract,btohqsg
that's what we're supposedly paying them to help us do,btohqsg
but they work against our interest,btohqsg
so inherently it's a shitty model,btohqsg
but sm ppl like to become fa,btohqsg
new generation of ‚Äúpm me now for fast cash‚Äù,btohqsg
which is why the best FAs wld sit down with you  go through the contract word by word  and disclose their own commissions n stuff,btohqsg
But I've seen my company approach one energy comapny do shit for them then sell the same proejcy,btohqsg
So in a way it's quite parasitic,btohqsg
find me a FA that does that and convince me that i need their product I'll sign on the spot lol,btohqsg
i mean wtv your company does (consulting  presumably) is your IP mah,btohqsg
might as well be ur own fa,btohqsg
I just had to do research on the competitor and change the details,btohqsg
