the high revv FD2R DC5 etc all up in value. although the interiro is not good but people buy because of the engine,btohqsg
The most ex Mazda is who??? Effini rx 7 Right,btohqsg
i mean they got every right to la really some of the best things to come out of japan,btohqsg
fd2 and dc2 are extremely well made  the buttons don’t even wear off after 15years,btohqsg
they are cars for enthusiasts. hot blooded overzealous honda boys,btohqsg
very seldom civic or integra owners need to find parts too for interior so i don’t get ur point tbh,btohqsg
Yeap but put on a track still crawl back home after losing to DSG,btohqsg
they look cheap plasticky stuff that is what i meant. it is not designed to be luxurious interior. it is for performance peple enjoy,btohqsg
Spoil repair only  can afford to play cannot afford repair then don't play,btohqsg
haha dsg and pdk nobody can fight la only thing is their reliability haha,btohqsg
