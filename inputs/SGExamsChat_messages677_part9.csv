I didn’t even touch GP before that,btohqsg
Then before the compre paper I was panicking like shit I forgot all the qn types,btohqsg

But GP is very unpredictable I guess,btohqsg
Like 2 of my friends o level English A1 but GP B,btohqsg
I got B4 for o level but GP A,btohqsg
I’m pretty sure YT got >85rp after the retake,btohqsg
Honestly u can ask the study group,btohqsg

I thank the fossil fuels qn,btohqsg
My AQ I didn’t even write 2 paragraphs,btohqsg
But i feel Os and As is vv different tho,btohqsg
And my first AQ body para was nonsense,btohqsg
Like the example I used was anecdotal,btohqsg
Oh i also got B4 for english at Os,btohqsg
Hmm yeah but I guess o level I may have screwed up more than usual for English,btohqsg

I think you should join tuition at this point  especially since you didn’t take a math you would need a lot of extra support,btohqsg
I agree but my brother says TPJC last time Aircon spoilt only fan,btohqsg
Econs you don’t need it but math I think you need,btohqsg
I also bs a lot for geog. There was too much to memorise so I just memorised what I spotted then the rest I use common sense to bs in stuff to write,btohqsg
I spot some stuff wrongly but luckily I didn’t mess up enough to drop to B,btohqsg
Some ppl have a better ability to bs stuff that Cambridge examiners accept,btohqsg
So it also depends on the person too,btohqsg
