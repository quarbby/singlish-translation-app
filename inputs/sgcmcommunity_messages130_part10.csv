Shag sia. Sg parking only rise,btohqsg
I never see it drop before,btohqsg
I apply Liao but I only went back once every month,btohqsg
"üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöò Landed property homeowners in Simei have been telling drivers to ""park at your HDB car park"" instead of their estate.‚û°Ô∏èhttp://bit.ly/3ZnaqLJFollow us on@mothershipsg",btohqsg
Wa any opinions on this ah,btohqsg
If someone's parking there short term or during the day  I don't see why the landed owners should have an issue,btohqsg
Want that specific place too much put a cone,btohqsg
I think entitlement strong leh. To put a cone. But if u get the lot good for u lah but dun feel so entitled until u start slashing ppl tyres,btohqsg
Sometimes need block some spaces to ensure free movement of all traffic,btohqsg
And be able to turn out of their houses,btohqsg
The idiot who park also common sense abit. Dun block ppl gate.,btohqsg
Common sense aint so common hmm,btohqsg
Got many idiots who park wrongly,btohqsg
It's not just in front of the gate,btohqsg
Sometimes they park opposite side slightly ahead,btohqsg
But the lane narrow so car from the house cannot turn alr,btohqsg
If hdb  need to pay ma. These drivers cheapos,btohqsg
Shift to within town area like orchard so you‚Äôre within ERP!,btohqsg
Erm road outside landed property is public property leh,btohqsg
Anyone can park one as long as legal,btohqsg
If they so angry  they should go do it back at them. Park in their HDB sheltered carparks!!!!!,btohqsg
i dont believe in vandalising anybody‚Äôs car   but people that anyhow park and block the gate deserve it,btohqsg
This is honestly more pissing off  I've been told off for parking in red lots at 6.45 pm at times when I just need to run and buy something,btohqsg
Because I'm not on season parking,btohqsg
I think I will just clamp their vehicles if they park outside my door,btohqsg
They didn't pay for the roadside parking did they?,btohqsg
Landed houses end up parking and blocking the roads,btohqsg
Because they cannot fit their cars inside,btohqsg
This is a very different case to parking in a proper spot in an estate,btohqsg
I think I do what I deem fit,btohqsg
Some people just doesn‚Äôt want to pay for the extra .,btohqsg
There are always black sheep around,btohqsg
Agree  but I feel like this has been happening a lot with short term parking as well,btohqsg
People are being told off to go away from estates,btohqsg
The enforcer must do something to it,btohqsg
About people complaining or people parking short term?,btohqsg
I will just clamp lor ‚Ä¶ then call police,btohqsg
the letter alr so nice also want to complain üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
You don't seem to get the point  I meant people parking in proper spaces short term,btohqsg
Short term as in is it legal to do that ?,btohqsg
If it is within the sop   then it is fine . But if it is not   then it is not .,btohqsg
Park in estates where you're allowed to park by the roadside as a driver who is paying road tax?,btohqsg
Gray area lor I will say,btohqsg
If an individual visits the estate,btohqsg
Parks for the period of the visit,btohqsg
You want to clamp them also?,btohqsg
So you ask your visitors to go park in an hdb nearby?,btohqsg
As long as you are not living within the vicinity  then you should not park there outside the private estate .,btohqsg
It isn't a private estate if it isn't gated.,btohqsg
And you aren't paying for the road to even enforce for people to not park for short terms there,btohqsg
