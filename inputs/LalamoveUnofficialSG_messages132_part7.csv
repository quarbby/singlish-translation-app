Withdrawal by Sunday 11.30pm received by end of Wednesday,btohqsg
OMG!!! With the rain this bad they offer this kinda rates….,btohqsg
Just dont support or take this kind of fare. The more driver or rider took it the more customer will continue to do this. There's alot more platform to earn too. Till the price is more reasonable then we will support Llm. If not sorry  we have bills to pay too.. work wisely. 🙏,btohqsg
Do they give you waiting time fee?,btohqsg
A lot of prs are doing lalamove,btohqsg
What’s new?  Even other apps are also accepting PRs on their app.,btohqsg
That’s why llm doesn’t mind low ball fare,btohqsg
They know the Malaysians will take,btohqsg
I don’t think they know that there are FT( WP & EP ) holders are on their platform. As long as their orders are taken.,btohqsg
Hey guys the purple icon with dollar sign means what? I asked the chat the agent tell me not sure 😅,btohqsg
Heavy rain…..but the rates….i think everyone should just hold up and not take any orders for now guys.,btohqsg
I’m not going against your ideology. Just that all hungry nowadays. Peak or off-peak. 😔,btohqsg
Yup I know man.Times like this  we gotta stay United. Otherwise  OMG!!,btohqsg
Same rates especially for the bikes  they really expect takers. And I’m surprised  there are,btohqsg
Bet they are the Malaysians moonlighting  for bike orders.,btohqsg
I feel you Brother. I’m with you on this. 👍🏻,btohqsg
That just makes it worse the fact that they are aware and the fact that they allow such things to happen?,btohqsg
Yes this one. I can't take screenshot of LLM app :(,btohqsg
"Careful cause some customer never really go to school. Input credit job then put the icon ""cash on delivery"".Even happen to me last yr  arriv3d at customer location and ask for whatbtype of payment actually he wants to pay? He says accidently input the cash on dwlivery icon. So i took the item and complete the job as credit job. Next day lalamove deduct the money on my wallet saying customer mention he pay with cash.... hahahahahahaa... Llm only side with customers.. we partners can suck thumb.... everything we do is wrong.. hahahahahah...",btohqsg
The only platform like rojak is Llm.. dont just take my words.. try & see for yourself.,btohqsg
Scamming ppl is a norm things nowdays.... sigh... ppl all become crazy.... Llm u can only do part time. Take 2-3 jobs log out. U do full time u will get many problems.,btohqsg
I triedLocation direct me to Serangoon area  but the guy actually in river valley area,btohqsg

This one also another scam thing customer play.... trying to get lesser fees.,btohqsg
Been in delivery line 18yrs.. been in operation side and even own a delivery company... the champion platform is llm... hahaha,btohqsg
Likely so. Coz this is the only common logo. 😅,btohqsg

Its a legal thing cream charger uses for baking. But ppl misused it. To get high its smilliar to laughing gas back then or can also say sniff glue even back then..n,btohqsg
He’s just lucky that the item didn’t explode together with his van.,btohqsg
And only coming to light now?,btohqsg
Kemaman is a condo and he asks you to park outside right?,btohqsg
Then expect us to carry heavy goods back to our carry be it rain or shine.,btohqsg
Yes.. they place the carton box outside the house not inside the house... and fees paying like shit.. hahahha... i warn them b4... this is illegal if misued the item.,btohqsg
Baking her backside. I’ve heard the items before when I go through humps.,btohqsg
No criminal gonna admit their crime,btohqsg
Just that it’s usually “well sealed”. Like overtaped.,btohqsg
