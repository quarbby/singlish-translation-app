A care plan is a document which is a record of needs  actions and responsibilities  a way to manage risk and outline contingency plans so that patients  family members  caregivers and other health professionals know what to do on a daily basis and also in the event of a crisis.Requirements:- Seniors above 60 years old with multiple needs / ADLs- Senior client is not receiving formal care management from social services- Does not have a care plan done up before- Senior and caregiver doesn't mind getting interviewed by us so that we can create the planWhat will be provided:- An interview will be conducted for an older person with multiple needs - A complete geriatric assessment- A genogram- Complete Care Plan for your own useWe hope to offer to the caregivers here first  if you're interested  please PM@mradriantanso that we can arrange for the interview next week :) We are going to offer this to 1 (one) family first to see if it helps with family  before we decide whether to continue on after.Thanks!,btohqsg
