"but majority of ppl  is just ""i may not like ur ways but ill just let you be and be civil""",btohqsg
There's some ppl I also dl their shit,btohqsg
and dont give me headaches with their NOISE POLLUTION,btohqsg
Think of it as a mosquito that keeps trying to suck ur blood but somehow doing a horrible job and u keep almost killing it,btohqsg
I don't care if U damn noise pollution during breaks,btohqsg
During breaks i can just go on my walks to the jh side,btohqsg
But she does it WHEN THE TEACHER IS IN CLASS,btohqsg
I cant just go on walks when the teacher is in class,btohqsg
If I legit pissed off enough,btohqsg
And for obv reasons i cant use earbuds either,btohqsg
Actl i go out of class alot in the morning to take walks,btohqsg
Ngl I rather see noisy Y1s than noisy ppl in my class,btohqsg
Y1s at least have self awareness  and is not THAT noisy,btohqsg
17 yr old U shld legit act like one,btohqsg
if they see someone staring they will lower a bit,btohqsg
I legit cannot stand her since y3,btohqsg
If it's lt or classroom area,btohqsg
If its canteen idc la. You go canteen party i can just go to my quiet spot,btohqsg
Then if you noisy during LESSON while teacher is in classroom,btohqsg
Atp i may just SNAPS one day,btohqsg
But tbh this 1 normal in my class,btohqsg
I just learn to tune kut,btohqsg
But if i get too overstimulated ill tell cher i need go toilet and then fk off somewhere else,btohqsg

I told you in ur channel gc alr,btohqsg
It was taught in Social studies  it means ‚ÄúNot in my backyard‚Äù essentially conveying how most Singapore does not care about anything that is not in their ‚Äúbackyard‚Äù,btohqsg
On smth I can't control what,btohqsg
I mean it‚Äôs great in social context but bring that mindset to another aspect of life and that could be a reason why your hdb corridor has your neighbour‚Äôs fish tank right outside your house üíÄ,btohqsg
ok yk i prepped 28.6 at home cause i scared ppl clown and dont bring money,btohqsg
then this girl went to touch the money i alr prepped to exchange for her 10 dollar note,btohqsg
Then some more she is shit at counting money (BASIC MATHS) so she legit wasted my time sia,btohqsg
btw for anyone curious this is what the girl did that make me SNAPS,btohqsg
no cause she wanted to exchange the money i alr prepped with her 10 dollar note but the thing is she was counting the money for like 5min alrbecause she cant do maththen i was kinda pissed cause other ppl havent put their money in the bag yet. ngl i rather they not touch the envelope money but then if they really need to  and they do it properly unlike this woman who cant even do basic counting  i wouldnt be so pissed,btohqsg
Moral of the story1. Bring exact amount or close ($2 is fine). Dont bring 10 dollars when the amount specified is 1.102. LEARN TO COUNT INSTEAD OF MAKING NOISE IN CLASS EVERYDAY,btohqsg
Tbh one of the few good things abt geog is collection of money alw in terms of $2,btohqsg

random shower thoughts(i did not shower for 3 days),btohqsg
i think she doesnt have bad intentions but she lacks self awareness (in many aspects),btohqsg
but I couldn't pinpoint who exactly,btohqsg
Good Friday commemorates Christ's ultimate sacrifice‚Äìin dying on the cross for Man's sins  so that Man can be reconciled with God through him. On the cross  justice and mercy meet.,btohqsg
