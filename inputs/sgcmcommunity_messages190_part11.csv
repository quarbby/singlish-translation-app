Would be very helpful if one can buy directly. Like enter car plate and pay directly,btohqsg
"Then dealers would find it very hard to claim 'Accident free""",btohqsg
Lol cos buyer dun wan accident car,btohqsg
Got some formOf accident before one,btohqsg
The thing is  GIA only captures those who have reported. Those that do not report  will not be captured in the system. Though insurers always encourage motorist to report the accident regardless of claiming or not.,btohqsg
I read that in China cars that kena bumper damage not considered accident car cos the frame not impacted,btohqsg
i was also surprised at the bidding today. prices such as 130k have become such a norm,btohqsg
They use penalty if didn't report  but if both sides coop  how would they know rite,btohqsg
Yup. Both sides really hush hush and private settle  it would not be captured. Insurer does encourage ba to always report the accident even if private settling. To protect the car owners,btohqsg
That's why fender bender small dents private settling will go unrecorded. But if say boot dent in etc... unless the person who caused the accident is super well off  then it might not be recorded. ie  person caused the accident offered a high amount of money to settle privately,btohqsg

Since she bidded  137k   then why still 97k ?,btohqsg
Final coe price is based on the lower end of the bids that are within the quota i believe,btohqsg
someone else can confirm the specifics,btohqsg
If got 100 quota  and 150 bid  will take the price of the 100th bid + $1 instead of 150th,btohqsg
Maybe election coming soon   the government hears all those who want t to buy cars,btohqsg
can alr see with budget 2024,btohqsg
They will give more out of the budget,btohqsg
Eg 100 bids all bid 90k n above.. 101th ranked bid plus $1 is the coe price,btohqsg
Lucky the system shut her out,btohqsg
Else she would have priced many others out,btohqsg
Like that is good for all the cat B,btohqsg
but she won the bid right?,btohqsg
BMW Group Asia sees record-breaking sales results in 2023Vietnam and Indonesia are said to have achieved 50% and 38% growth in BMW sales year-on-year respectively.➡️ Read itHERE!Why not SG? 🧐,btohqsg
Yah cos the winning bid is below hers,btohqsg
Then AD will need to refund those who bid for guaranteed coe,btohqsg
Can request those who bid for coe all put $1 . Then when it close   it will be $1,btohqsg
No ba  cos their rebate would have been between 50k to 60k as per market rate during that period,btohqsg
$2  cos will add $1 to closing bid. And that is if govt doesn't charge bidders for market rigging 🤭🤭,btohqsg
Nvm 3 more bids left (or 5?),btohqsg
They will continue till their bid ended,btohqsg
Lol that is if they made it  cos after today's close close shave to 75k  next round sure sky rocket,btohqsg
I wanna ask.. for this  the car dealers can actually collect $137K from the customer but only put in $97K to bid right?,btohqsg
Bid success then walk in ad,btohqsg
Don’t understand why ppl want ad bid for them,btohqsg
Cause people don’t have 100k only have 50k :(,btohqsg
You/dealer will put 10k deposit to join the bidding exercise. can choose to bid any amount.Only need to pay the difference (ie winning coe bid - 10k) when you use coe to register the car,btohqsg

Eh can I get an opinion on something  I just bought a 2nd car.. 3 years old.. from an agent.. 1 week after I collect the car  the car plate LED got issue  followed by the engine oil.. I thought these kind of servicing should be done by the agent before they sell the car to us? I bought Opel  from an Opel agent,btohqsg
