More recent papers from the EJU.,btohqsg
How hard are these by SG A-level standards?,btohqsg
Is the question assuming all the curves are straight lines,btohqsg
If yes my guess is 200,btohqsg
coz i was losted how to start,btohqsg
I think it's some default Japanese font,btohqsg
I also don‚Äôt know how to put it into words without a diagram I can refer to in my explanation  but basically I just looked at the monopoly graph to determine the deadweight loss then let $150 at 50th quantity to be where AR intersects MC,btohqsg
wait so they only care during bmt,btohqsg
why i cant save this sticker?,btohqsg
I also can‚Äôt for some reason lol,btohqsg
Not sure if this is correct??,btohqsg
Then the shaded part is dwl,btohqsg
Yeah like that assuming all curves are straight line,btohqsg
If i remembered how to link perfectly competitive to monopoly,btohqsg
Coz i forgot how to link and i suddenly remembered how the monopoly graph looked like oops,btohqsg
Clearly not prepared for finals on monday,btohqsg
yay fail then dabao next sem,btohqsg
then since is ur last year,btohqsg
ur lecturer will say ok i let u pass,btohqsg
Alright I‚Äôll send this sticker on Monday,btohqsg
ok if i can end early,btohqsg
no like the test will it comprise of ippt also,btohqsg
if like i in my prime,btohqsg
My teacher just said to compare  assume that for perfectly competitive market  summation of SSpc=MC of monopoly  then in the perfectly competitive market equilibrium quantity and price would be at where supply meets demand curve in order to compare.Only for PC firm graph then would AR be perfectly elastic,btohqsg
Journey to work I alr saw like 5,btohqsg
And my bus don't even use expressway,btohqsg
Tampinies accident suddenly tp all action wtf,btohqsg
Bro listing the whole Chinese ensemble,btohqsg
Dizi is so hard  I run out of breath on it,btohqsg
guys hav your school started doing yearly tys yet,btohqsg
You can start on your own,btohqsg
why is this not option 2 ah,btohqsg
"The moment you wait until school start  they gonna do 3 papers and say "" do the rest yourself""",btohqsg
u tell me how to eliminate air pollution?,btohqsg
Can blow it away like what Malaysia want to do,btohqsg
Because MSC does not equal to MSB at quantity=0,btohqsg
but i tot removing the pollution will eliminate the negative externality,btohqsg
Is it smth like there are other factors that could impact social welfare also,btohqsg
MSC = MSB is when social welfare is most optimised,btohqsg
cause the sentence structure sounds like a normative statement,btohqsg
not sure if im reading the option correctly but i dun get the part where they say 'eliminate some but not all'  but eliminate all will enhance social welfare even more what,btohqsg
so removing everything may contribute to a bigger deadweight loss,btohqsg
so better to remove some until msc= msb,btohqsg
but im not sure if the qns cares about feasibility,btohqsg
It's not wrong  but it's just not realistic,btohqsg
but i find the sentence structure abit weird,btohqsg
like it makes it sounds like if they cut pollution to 0 (if it is even feasible)  society welfare wun be enhanced,btohqsg
i still dk why i remember econs till today,btohqsg
He's btr than Ms ong imo,btohqsg
The way I can think of it is this,btohqsg
but say it is possible  why wun society welfare be further enhanced,btohqsg
You are building like roads in the neighbourhood. Obviously building roads will increase social welfare but at the same time it will increase pollution while you build the roads,btohqsg
this out of pt  bud said it out of the blue,btohqsg
hi mayushii  there is someone who is interested in Japan uni and working in japan. will u be ok if I ping him and he can ask u some qns ?,btohqsg
Every road you build  you are generating more positive welfare than generating the negative welfare from the air pollution due to building,btohqsg
Obviously there comes to a point when building too much roads is pointless and can create a lot of social problems,btohqsg
oki@darkharbingeroftheabysscultthis is mayushii who works in Japan currently,btohqsg
So you want to build enough roads,btohqsg
he may be better suited to answer ur qn,btohqsg
wtv u mentioned  you're starting to look from the bigger picture,btohqsg
oh so like more of while increasing societal welfare  it is inevitably increasing pollution  so cant really try to aim for 0,btohqsg
0 pollution means you are not building roads,btohqsg
But building roads generates a lot of positive welfare when you start building it,btohqsg
omg MSB reminds me of meridian soccer boys,btohqsg
So every unit of road you build  your MSB > MSC until you reach the point where it becomes too overkill,btohqsg
so like MSB will kinda be reduced at the expense if we try to cut pollution,btohqsg
and regarding pollution as a negative externality  just need to cut in moderation to not compromise on welfare?,btohqsg
actually i did not think about this aspect:-(,btohqsg
Same for building a electricity factory,btohqsg
I mean the qn is not very clear  cos air pollution arises from the production of goods and services. So the horizontal axis would not be ‚Äúquantity of air pollution‚Äù but rather goods and services that can lead to air pollution during production/consumption as a negative externality,btohqsg
Generating electricity is good but it will cause pollution,btohqsg
But of course we don't want to generate too much,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just like how for cigarettes the socially optimal level is not Q=0,btohqsg
from the question  i did not look so deep into it,btohqsg
So we want to find that optimal point,btohqsg
How many days you ck this year,btohqsg
esch can be a econs tutor before even entering uni,btohqsg
oh btw have u gotten offer,btohqsg
But I was legit sick those days except 1 where I just went for a medical appt and doctor gave me an MC despite me not needing one,btohqsg
You generate enough electricity but do not generate too much pollution until it becomes a problem,btohqsg
If your unit doesn‚Äôt have mc restriction then just Keng lor,btohqsg
But also do it only if you have no work,btohqsg
im a crazy bad example not to learn from...i went to school with a fever before,btohqsg
Else your colleagues will hate you,btohqsg
just coz idw to skip lessons and watch the lecture recording,btohqsg
And if your chers are nice they could zoom the lesson,btohqsg
actually even in sec sch  i love band too much  i once went to cca even when i was down w a flu,btohqsg
my jc time is still non-covid lol,btohqsg
i didnt know its existence until i entered uni,btohqsg
For me getting extra sleep is the motivation,btohqsg
I hate waking up at 6+,btohqsg
neh zoom is much better than teams,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a light sleeper so can‚Äôt fall asleep,btohqsg
Some siao ppl actually enforce the rule,btohqsg
Then how come you can sleep,btohqsg
I thought SAF got more redundant stuff though?,btohqsg
Like even ASA got competency test,btohqsg
Ya that‚Äôs what I mean  got redundant stuff,btohqsg
For scdf I think it depends where you get posted to,btohqsg
But not as lucky as those stories I heard of ppl in the SAF where they only report to work 5-10 days per month,btohqsg
Wait you can drop out of bmt?,btohqsg
I thought you‚Äôre forced to complete,btohqsg
So how do they decide which person needs to go for the 2 day asa course,btohqsg
Hi  with a 2.7/5 NUS High CAP (roughly equivalent to a 3.16 Poly GPA)  which Japanese unis could I realistically aim for?,btohqsg
In terms of university  I really have no idea,btohqsg
I don't go to the university in Japan and study so I have no idea how that system works,btohqsg
Ohhh r u that guy in japan,btohqsg
Someone talked abt working in Japan or smth briefly in this chat,btohqsg
nah  I'm not working in Japan yet  mayushii is,btohqsg
Then elab on the jap market Ish kinda iirc,btohqsg
I'm the guy currently working here in Japan,btohqsg
which majors do you think will have good job demand in about 5 to 6 years in Japan?,btohqsg
I rmb waseda has a 3.0/4 minimum requirement,btohqsg
Which major? I feel that CS is getting more popular in Japan now,btohqsg
Very cool sia y'all observe the firms or consumer  behaviour is it,btohqsg
I forgot but it's pretty cool,btohqsg
If you like engineering  Japan is something you might enjoy,btohqsg
the way you'd talked about it and stuff,btohqsg
How we are doing a form of order replenishment system,btohqsg
so CS and engineering (I hear telecoms engineering is big in Japan  but not sure which SG uni degrees are good prep for that) should be the two big directions  right?,btohqsg
tbf living costs  even in Tokyo  are also cheaper,btohqsg
There are actually a lot of startups in Japan ngl,btohqsg
Actually does Japan have a pension service?,btohqsg
Of course they want someone with the experience so going as a fresh grad is not really advisable,btohqsg
Or does it work like IRA accounts,btohqsg
Especially since yen is getting way weaker now,btohqsg
We do have the pension system in Japan,btohqsg
It really depends on the company and the department,btohqsg
To the point I feel actually working in SG is worse than in Japan in terms of WLB,btohqsg
As to how much btr.... ^ again?,btohqsg
A bit personal but mayushi do u plan to come back sg when you are older or are you gnna stay in japan 4eva,btohqsg
sg wlb is üíÄüíÄ for 90% of the population,btohqsg
oh is that your observation and/or based on exp,btohqsg
Opens up to check. First thing pops up Issues of Non payment,btohqsg
Of course coming back to SG,btohqsg
One example is probably the WFH thingy in Singapore news these days,btohqsg
There's some news or study that showed sgreans kinda tired on a daily basis,btohqsg
Like probably the stance for some firms in Singapore is complete work at office in SG,btohqsg
But in Japan it is more of a flexible working hours,btohqsg
Heck even the traditional ones are pretty flexible,btohqsg
Nah I going niall horan one concert,btohqsg
And most companies stance these days is half WFH and half work at office these days,btohqsg
Like your official working hours is 9.15am to 6.15pm for example,btohqsg
But you can come early and go home early,btohqsg
Or even earlier like 7am to 4pm,btohqsg
Or you can come in later like 10am to 7pm,btohqsg
Obviously it is subjected to if the office is open by then,btohqsg
this is Japan. I bet the trains don't run that early even,btohqsg
But for people like me working from home  yes I started work at 6am before,btohqsg
Heck I have a colleague who comes to the office at 6.45am before,btohqsg
My sleep schedule is fucked up since Uni,btohqsg
Used to think hey 8am class not bad,btohqsg
As long as you come in at the critical period,btohqsg
Like say from 10am to 3pm,btohqsg
Now I wanna murder my prof if he schedules a 9:30 class,btohqsg
They don't care what time you come in,btohqsg
You can start at like 5am and end at 3pm and they don't care,btohqsg
Its very surprising that Japan is more flexible in this aspect though,btohqsg
SG we really like the rule book,btohqsg
Japan is way way more rule book than Singapore,btohqsg
But even Japan can also be flexible,btohqsg
So when you look at such stuff  you go ???,btohqsg
Almost all the offices in Japan are open office concepts,btohqsg
Which ngl I actually like it,btohqsg
does anyone know what does the sentinel cyber programme entails,btohqsg
I think SG is actually open ngl at least the office jobs I had.,btohqsg
I was actually really shock when I saw the statistics before I went to Japan for work,btohqsg
Allows you to pack more too had one whereby it was a hot desk thing,btohqsg
Open office concept means there are no seemingly private cubicles,btohqsg
Like how employees in Singapore work longer than in Japan,btohqsg
I will throw the philosophical question do we even have free will?,btohqsg
I had seen offices whereby it was designed around the idea of a panopticon,btohqsg
Its only bad when you have a micromanager in front of you,btohqsg
And I feel that having the cubicle is more claustrophobic,btohqsg
That one u become director than can,btohqsg
Oh and our office is free seating de,btohqsg
So you can choose your seating as long as it is available,btohqsg
You don't like the colleague  you can choose to sit somewhere far from him,btohqsg
But errr u sit there in the same spot for as long as you are employed rite,btohqsg
Oh... so it's legit like hot desking,btohqsg
Actually I do change my seating place sometimes,btohqsg
Sometimes I want to see the nice view from my office,btohqsg
But then everyday u gotta choose a different view..,btohqsg
My office is actually at 49F,btohqsg
I come into work first thing is I go get coffee and sit down it's like instinct one,btohqsg
So I can see the northern Japan,btohqsg
My first instinct is to get hot water,btohqsg
I mean I sit at the different side so...,btohqsg
Can we see you instead? üò∂‚Äçüå´,btohqsg
No matter where you sit you can't see the Fuji anyway,btohqsg
Do U ship stuff to sg,btohqsg
I know you all want to buy stuff lol,btohqsg
cuz sometimes iw to buy stuff from mercari,btohqsg
Actually it depends on what you buy,btohqsg
Like I can only ship stuff that are non lithium batteries,btohqsg
So if you ask me to buy iphones and ship to here then of course not,btohqsg
And I know where to find actually,btohqsg
Kuro should i cut my nails,btohqsg
ü•≤ The Bedok 85 satay bee hoon stall will be closing on Apr. 30  after 30 years.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/4bd62FlFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
lets eat there on the 29th,btohqsg
Honestly speaking I think a lot are due to the fact that some managers are incompetent,btohqsg
Coupled by the fact that quite a lot of people actually want to be manager,btohqsg
But not everyone can be a manager,btohqsg
I'm glad I get to know more abt such stuff liddat,btohqsg
like it's one of those stuff u don't get to hear that often till it comes from someone who had exp in it,btohqsg
actually@chemcertmr also can we go tm watch football,btohqsg
Always good to hear more stuff around,btohqsg
idk u lend me tm shirt lor,btohqsg
then i sneak in like a student,btohqsg

I hope you shut up for finals prep  let god do the work,btohqsg
ppl complaining that one stop is 0.99,btohqsg
If i dont shut up i will be kicked out of the exam hall,btohqsg
oh yes the prof should not shut up then,btohqsg
Speaking of which sometimes i annoyed they talked at the last 15min then i cant concentrate for that 1-2min they are talking,btohqsg
was abt to ask how many stops,btohqsg
Like making the last xx min announcement,btohqsg
I saved some money by running from 1 mrt to the next,btohqsg
Actually sometimes i just walk home fr mrt to save the bus fare,btohqsg
yest i literally ran from jurong east mrt to clementi mrt,btohqsg
I save money by taking a 30 minute walk to and fro my office most of the time,btohqsg
When I work at the office,btohqsg
Plus I'm actually like 30+ now so some exercise is beneficial for me,btohqsg
My back hurts very frequently as compared to when I was younger,btohqsg
no lah from house to camp with smart 4,btohqsg
Heck one of my friends actually cycle to work,btohqsg
i rmb my road run at pasir ris park..walked the whole way,btohqsg
"ppl ask me ""wah never sweat ah""..i say ""yea",btohqsg
Some more it is to and fro,btohqsg
bruh one of my relatives cycle from ecp to marina bay,btohqsg
And its like a habit for him most of the time,btohqsg
If uw I can bring u walk to ecp,btohqsg
Cuz you'll past changi v one,btohqsg
run along ecp reach marina bay,btohqsg
pasir ris is closer to changi v than tamp to changi v,btohqsg
Ppl from other schs also come watch nsg,btohqsg
just go from main gate U shld be fine,btohqsg
Btr to cycle cuz it's a cycling path,btohqsg
I still see 1-2 ppl walk tho,btohqsg
u and me meet then we gogo,btohqsg
bruh aint ecp a twisting road,btohqsg
uk iirc last yr class bonding ecp and I'm like I can cycle home if I rent bike,btohqsg
Also there's this hidden mee soto store nubbad  otw back to tamp/pasir ris from ecp,btohqsg
I feel that exercising makes it much better,btohqsg
Mine is more of bad sleeping position,btohqsg
Or sit down and do my work for too long,btohqsg
So I need to walk around and move my body,btohqsg
actly I use those uk tcm some grass/herb paste which burns,btohqsg
but it's more effective than the salonpas shit,btohqsg
I've had exp cuz man I was in a gymnastics-like cca,btohqsg
Chinese dance ü§° back in pri sch,btohqsg
sry the answer can't be wrong when your statement is clearly of utmost ambiguity,btohqsg
ayo that means last year u were in 10,btohqsg
Let me translate to u@chemcerBasically it meansDo better,btohqsg
Ofc I made a lapse in judgement thinking you'd do any better to begin with,btohqsg
I legit don't feel like writing this essay,btohqsg
It's due on Monday and it's literally my WA,btohqsg
But eh I'm 2 paragraphs in so I guess it's not too bad,btohqsg
I'm an old uncle at this point liao,btohqsg
Even in online settings  people still thought I am younger than what I am supposed to be,btohqsg
At this point I'm really catfishing people,btohqsg
yt should I continue with hist or do chem,btohqsg
no more timed WA  history is due on 29 apr,btohqsg
but I have chem tutorial due tmr,btohqsg
at least I started on hist today,btohqsg
so it's not like I have 0 stuff,btohqsg

Ikr lol but for STARs I gotta take the L bruh I did a mutual swap for one high sought after slot for 1 mod in return for the shitty 9:30 one for another,btohqsg
The guy who has a finals in 7 days and still hasnt learnt anything from 13 weeks yet (fr),btohqsg
I have a final too but I procrastinating,btohqsg
It's your time to shine DAILOU,btohqsg
Watch me clutch 13 weeks in 7 days...hopefully,btohqsg
I wanna just pass this and gtfo,btohqsg

Eh wait when is your scheduled graduation?,btohqsg
Hmm I think at this rate I might be able to join you,btohqsg

That word is thrown too easily in that sch lmao,btohqsg
Lowkey took one just as a joke,btohqsg
Just as long as u clear enough AUs for promo can liao,btohqsg
Funny enough i still keep everything i own in MI,btohqsg
If i dig hard enough i probably can find it,btohqsg
I keep my papers from secondary school..,btohqsg
I still have my S4 prelim papers,btohqsg
I still have my combined ss and hist self written notes...,btohqsg
I dont wanna expose how old i do be but,btohqsg
I never made notes... waste ma time,btohqsg
My papers gonna be no longer on tys anymore...,btohqsg
Through your photo? Not that old la ngl 23-24?,btohqsg
Like max but 20s ish lor,btohqsg
TYS is 10 years he needs to take O at like 2014 2015,btohqsg
Very sad u never talk to me... very small world we live in,btohqsg
Nice to be that young fr,btohqsg
Oops when you are in spms pls look for me,btohqsg
HAHAHHA SHIT OK WO BU YAO JIANG LE,btohqsg
I TALK ABOUT MY AGE I SAD AF,btohqsg
I go there daily as a hallway to southspine,btohqsg
Actually im not even in spms anymore,btohqsg
This sem ive probably been to school less than 30 times?,btohqsg
Only once every week for compulsory lab lmao and probably math tutorial,btohqsg
I spend my time in SHHK and Hive,btohqsg
I spend my time in hall because i like working with dual monitor HAHA,btohqsg
Bruh u brought a dual monitor setup to hall,btohqsg
I saw one of my seniors Brought his mf 3d printing setup to hall,btohqsg
At least yall have lifts that actually function... I go to hive daily and istg the lifts there they purposely one as a ploy to force you to use the stairs,btohqsg
Oh fuck the lifts at hive,btohqsg
I do they fucking rub it in lmao every stair is labelled with the calories u burn,btohqsg
But all I think of how late I am going to be going to Tutorial,btohqsg
then you can wait for the lift,btohqsg
I alr damn titled having to go to Tutorial at 930 I ain't waking up earlier,btohqsg
i once saw someone bring their whole setup to the hall study room,btohqsg
Speaking of hall I need to move out in May,btohqsg
Im gonna be squatting in h7 next year,btohqsg
I heard those are damn ex tho,btohqsg
give yourself 20+ mins to go to class,btohqsg
they were ex when i was there and they've only gone up,btohqsg
Yeah now is like 580 or smth,btohqsg
Im so tired the whole of today,btohqsg
Like literally when i open my notes i start yawning and trying to force my eyes open,btohqsg
My diet is a mix of coffee and redbull,btohqsg
Yes else idk what is actually going inüíÄ,btohqsg
When every 2-3 slides eyes closed for 5min,btohqsg
this is literally what is said in MI notes,btohqsg
Think they just high lol and copied whatever was on the reference book,btohqsg
i hope this isnt how they taught yall how to draw hydrogen bonds,btohqsg
Uni has taught me everything is wrong,btohqsg
Im not sure if this makes sense,btohqsg
Im not sure if im doing things right coz my ans is like very in between 3% and 4% lol,btohqsg
I dont think youre using the formula correctly,btohqsg
Say real who can earn > $10k immediately,btohqsg
Talking abt how he want collect title,btohqsg
damn getting scolded by sgt no cut pay one ah,btohqsg
Growing 10% yearly means to cal the income at the 35th yr  it is 6250 x 1.1^(35-1) hor,btohqsg
There is like 3% and 4% as options  and my ans is like 3.5 (or 3.47) which is smack in between,btohqsg
35y fr now means to the power of 35-1,btohqsg
Oh you know why it is 4%?,btohqsg
Like is that the final answer?,btohqsg
My friend sub it and try out each  then she ask how to solve w/o trial and errorüíÄ,btohqsg
Does it ask for inflation adjusted,btohqsg
Or just literally is a round up thing,btohqsg
Yea coz the qns say approximately,btohqsg
0.53% annualised is like... massive ngl hahaha,btohqsg
Yeah then 4% lmao I tot Econs was damn anal about accuracy,btohqsg
If your n power is 35  then yes it will be 3.65%,btohqsg
If your n power is 34  then it will be 3.47%,btohqsg
In this case the power should be 34 or 35,btohqsg
The next thing I guess is because a round up thing,btohqsg
Because if you think about it,btohqsg
It will only match if it hits at least the 3.47%,btohqsg
So 3% means confirm won't reach one,btohqsg
Eh wait i think the power shld be 35,btohqsg
So have to be 4% liao,btohqsg
in 35 years means 35 years from now,btohqsg
Coz i was doing basic examples. In 2 years  u gonna x1.1 2 times  in 5y is x5 times,btohqsg
I always hv problems deciding when need -1,btohqsg
ngl i feel the sji field so smol,btohqsg
last year i played there was damn shiok,btohqsg
idk lah but its like opposite the mrt,btohqsg
i had to go 1 round,btohqsg
But u don't look that old leh,btohqsg
You aint even seen me irl before sir,btohqsg
Last time u got put dp what,btohqsg
I won't say which country u took the photo in,btohqsg
My memory works in mysterious ways,btohqsg
Im old okay back in my parents day,btohqsg
They already had kids at this age,btohqsg
idk why last time the gen have kids q early,btohqsg
No excuse  u live in school,btohqsg
since when u were at home anw,btohqsg
my 0830 4 hour lab sessions during undergrad üíÄ,btohqsg
1530 3 hour lab sessions for H2 Biology,btohqsg
liddat dh to stay in office,btohqsg
They confirm were damn empty one,btohqsg
Or were they the only slots,btohqsg
tbh it‚Äôs about the same bc the alternative is 1330 to 1730,btohqsg
ending that time is a pain too,btohqsg
I think the 1330 should be the one with the most demand imo,btohqsg
my group has always gone for the morning one tbh,btohqsg
then again  3 of us stay hall  1 stay at city harvest church there   1 stay boon lay so like,btohqsg
Yall early birds ig.. I cmi that early precisely because I live in hall,btohqsg
"A man left 43 cats alone in an HDB flat between Aug and Nov 2021. Two died and the rest experienced ""pain and suffering""  according to a vet.He was sentenced to 20 days' jail:https://cna.asia/3Jzg5Je",btohqsg
I would be like that in a few weeks,btohqsg
Do u bring your stuff back or just throw?,btohqsg
bring back bc i usually go back to hall anyway,btohqsg
I‚Äôm worried about doing Econs in uni especially after seeing that interest rate qn,btohqsg
Im sry if i killed u,btohqsg
If I were to resit for the same h2 math paper I took last year I‚Äôd probably get a C or D instead of an A cos I forgot so much,btohqsg
Nah I just have to suck it up and force myself to touch the math even if I hate it,btohqsg
Tbh it is not gonna be the math u hate,btohqsg
At least I think the non math part I‚Äôll enjoy,btohqsg
But dun worry it is just first order,btohqsg
According to people I have heard from,btohqsg
What is it that you think I‚Äôll hate?,btohqsg
Dun tell me u cannot do differentiation to calculate MR fr TR or MC fr TC,btohqsg
Dun tell me algebra is a problem,btohqsg
Then maybe you will do some form of linear programming,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs easier than h2 math I can probably manage but doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll like doing them also,btohqsg
Is it something like what Xavier sent in the other chat a while ago lol,btohqsg
Cause 80% of the h2 history students take econs,btohqsg
So they are all at lecture now,btohqsg
I don't know what he sends whoops,btohqsg
And now history lect hall only got me and another guy and the teacher,btohqsg
The equation for determining PED at any point along a straight line graph,btohqsg
Or is it not stuff like that,btohqsg
That lesson bout go into history,btohqsg
That one is not expected of u to lay that right out,btohqsg
But to understand the concept behind it,btohqsg
Cos I googled this and I saw it‚Äôs about creating linear equations in Econs,btohqsg
And also i realised nus econs and ntu econs is different ya,btohqsg
Wait let me try to find,btohqsg
they will usually arrive a bit late cause of the h2 econ lecture,btohqsg
Nus is mainly mcqs / fill in blanks actually,btohqsg
Linear optimization is usually if you have like super duper a lot of constraints,btohqsg
Fml the heat is giving me a headache,btohqsg
I definitely won‚Äôt enjoy doing these kinds of stuff,btohqsg
This one is not really required but it is a general concept u need to know,btohqsg
Nope i was trolling  im not an econs student  im currently taking 1 econs elective,btohqsg
This is more of like analysing the case for different values of Q and like trying to find the link between Q and PED,btohqsg
Linear programming is usually used when you got a lot of constraints,btohqsg
Then you want to find the best values to produce numerous number of goods,btohqsg
That helps to maximise your profit/minimize your loss,btohqsg
Usually economics will do a little bit of OR,btohqsg
if u take higher-level econs mods and not just ‚Äúintro to econs‚Äù it‚Äôs not just gonna be algebra and dydx lol. u almost need everything from h2 math and even more,btohqsg
my macro mod this sem ü§£,btohqsg
Gg I‚Äôll probably try to choose mods in a way where I can avoid as much math as possible,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think I can survive this,btohqsg
Yea I knew it is definitely way way more than that,btohqsg
this one is core mod. cannot escape üòÇ,btohqsg
Bruh not gonna be it man,btohqsg
I wun deny this coz in a way yes,btohqsg
I need to answer the qns,btohqsg
Oh yea calculus module in econs major is compulsory,btohqsg
One of my friends who took econs major accidentally took calculus for math major,btohqsg
Math is also applied english coz i rmb not understanding what a stats qns was asking during AsüíÄ,btohqsg
And then I know from her that yes there is math module there,btohqsg
That was between A and B  if i did not manage to ans that in the end  i think i would not hv gotten A,btohqsg
Yep welcome to see way more math in econs I supposed?,btohqsg
Still have to do coding as well,btohqsg
I remember one of my friends his thesis does some programming,btohqsg
Tbh once math came into play  i totgg.com  like applying math into econs during the exam was not gonna be it,btohqsg
But tbh it became the part of econs i enjoy,btohqsg
I died in a pol sci elective mod,btohqsg
Got conned by a pol sci friend as an easy elective,btohqsg
cuz if not she will farm,btohqsg
Every course except for med / dent and idk if nursing also‚Ä¶hv electives to complete,btohqsg
And also pharm is not part of chs,btohqsg
Yes CHS has a set of common curriculum pre-allocated in y1/2 (so called replace the general education electives),btohqsg
But it does not replace the unrestricted electives,btohqsg
Every sci course has even pharm,btohqsg
U can see it as that  some take it to map over to do minor / major,btohqsg
As long as ur timetable permits,btohqsg
As long as i am breathing,btohqsg
Why ur lesson end so early,btohqsg
I dun remember any day but wednesday ending early,btohqsg
U may need to walk through main gate,btohqsg
Wah this one is to another level,btohqsg
So supposedly there is a calculus prerequisites module that the econs student must take,btohqsg
Then it happens that the calculus module for offered by a lot of different majors,btohqsg
