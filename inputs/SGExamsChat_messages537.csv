my friend had to sing last yr,btohqsg
EH WAIT that's interview I think.,btohqsg
Any math geniuses here know how to solve?,btohqsg
let total volume be x  volume removed be y,btohqsg
so after removed  left with (x-y)*0.9 milk  and (x-y)*0.1 water,btohqsg
then u add back y*0.3 milk and y*0.7 water,btohqsg
to get (x-y)*0.9+y*0.3 = 0.9x - 0.6y milk,btohqsg
final volume is still x  60% milk,btohqsg
so 0.9x - 0.6y = 0.6x,btohqsg
0.9 * 0.5x = 0.45x milk removed,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone here currently in cyber nsf or part of the dis work learn scheme? I got a few qns,btohqsg

Wow didn’t know ppl below 21 cared about this  good to have some awareness.,btohqsg
My honest two cents:If ppl can’t afford  just use the school facilities.10 dollar is literally nothing  you cannot possibly expect hotel or conventional hall to rent to you at that price  unless you have 1 000 people paying and all willing to squeeze in.10 dollar can order some buffet style and hang a few balloons up  use the school equipment and decor good enough liao.Sec school prom right? Don’t need to be too fussed if not a grand affair  JC/Poly then can experience again,btohqsg
Maybe you can book badminton court at CC and Zhng it to look more style for 10 dollar and 200 pax lol,btohqsg

bruh i think i never gotten <3 prompts in my whole entire oral life b4,btohqsg
what bedok said about luck is basically me,btohqsg
so shld i go 100% on chi,btohqsg
luck was what sent me to poly,btohqsg
you said you need to pass all subs right? what subs you failing now?,btohqsg
shld i remember as much words as i can for chinese for vocab read chinese articles speak chinese regularly,btohqsg
to improve chi..i just binge watch chinese mediacorp shows,btohqsg

i watch chinese romance show 😭,btohqsg
although like 20% idk but yes,btohqsg
issit possible to improve chinese speaking in 1-2 weeks LOL idts,btohqsg
"bruh after prelim my chi teacher..told me infront of the whole class ""im afraid you will be the only one that cant pass""",btohqsg
actually nvm not for national exams,btohqsg
my oral prelim my teacher gave the passage beforehand the day before,btohqsg
and asked us memorise the words,btohqsg
but not counted tho she asked us memorise,btohqsg
so we recognise when we read,btohqsg
i had one friend that did that...,btohqsg
the theme was sports..he talked into health,btohqsg
and plus i got coursework and remediation,btohqsg
as for now knowing i feel like i cant go pfp,btohqsg
I have tuition but i want to give up,btohqsg
Idk my tutor doesnt really help me much,btohqsg
She just writes better answers for me but i dont learn,btohqsg
so you average getting like lvl2 on qns ah,btohqsg
And she always kinda saying oh i always write one page for this,btohqsg
I got like 2/20 for history,btohqsg
And she always say she wld study 12 hours and can finish syllabus in 8 hrs,btohqsg
I never finish and i throw context knowledge in eval in base source,btohqsg
my time it was part a to e,btohqsg
i never once finished my humans paper once,btohqsg
If you had AQF..could have gotten at least 2 marks each qns,btohqsg
Cant change tutor now too late,btohqsg
I can ask her replace humans with chinese,btohqsg
She teaches me 3 subjs also,btohqsg
I was like planning if cannot finish one qn ill just finish up the paragraph and move on,btohqsg
the marks you told me  basically means you missed out on the humanities template,btohqsg
You likely missed out on AQF or (Answer Question First),btohqsg
I feel like im neglecting my other subjects cause i like math and prefer math so i just think ill take abreak from math,btohqsg
No..first off you need to be concise and clear what direction you want to aim,btohqsg
you said sec 5  but after sec 5...where do you want to go,btohqsg
because from the marks you are getting...im fairly confident you can get 19pts not problem,btohqsg
ok  if you got time lookup the entrance requirement for the course you want,btohqsg
it is just chi or humans thatll bring me badly,btohqsg
is cut off pt at 5-13,btohqsg
no she is not even hitting 5 marks for humans,btohqsg
but my future depends on eae,btohqsg
that is a tell tale sign someone did not answer question first...cause i was that person  write long no use...the momment no AQF instant 1 mark for that qns,btohqsg
I know because that is what i did,btohqsg
unless in sec 5..you suddenly face a miracle,btohqsg
fyi  i got 19 for n levels  25 for o levels,btohqsg
man i feel abit demoralised cause i only did like math timed practice today,btohqsg
wait but how is your social studies,btohqsg
but idk last year sec 3 eoy i almost passed but forget got srq,btohqsg
i scored higher than a friend who did srq,btohqsg
but my passion for humans deteriorated ever since i step into sec 4,btohqsg
suddenly everything seems foreign to me,btohqsg
you mean in terms of content being taught?,btohqsg
the history content is honestly too much for memorising to be effective,btohqsg
but my tutor spot chaps for me hitler stalin LON kor war,btohqsg
you know when bedok earlier say gongjiao...yea do that for seq and pray something hits,btohqsg
when my o level qns came out...one of the topics was a topic that literally appeared on a single page of the whole history textbook,btohqsg
like it was part of hitler but it was breifly mentioned,btohqsg
I think if i do that I fail,btohqsg
Plus need context knowledge for source based,btohqsg
my n level prelims was 28,btohqsg
why is the sg education like this,btohqsg
my future depends on this 🥲💔,btohqsg
Erm social studies i can memorise content and examples,btohqsg
unless you heng that within the sbq got mention info you can use for seq,btohqsg
i cant memorise ss for shit,btohqsg
the only takeaway out of the whole SS subject i have was NIMBY,btohqsg
nimby is the who will bear the cost i think,btohqsg
my o levels year for Humans was literally one of the hardest in a good 5-6 yrs,btohqsg
in both ss and hist...we had two hybrid qns,btohqsg
no it came out for o levels,btohqsg
"my teachers were the one that said ...""i wont come out""",btohqsg
oh...idk bout answering format  cause to me..i was getting like level 1 or 2,btohqsg
so no choice die die have to follow school format,btohqsg
"I based my assumptions of my year being the hardest off reddit and all the ""impossibilities"" that my school said would never come out that came out",btohqsg
One of the sources from my o levels ss paper...,btohqsg
first qns for ss...alr kill ppl,btohqsg
alot of people did not know..including me,btohqsg
bruh my ss o levels paper was so tough...most students did not even know if sources were good or bad,btohqsg
How we do reliability..let alone dual reliability..if we did not even know if the sources were good or bad...,btohqsg
meant reliability...yea comparison is just compare,btohqsg
its part of the new syllabus,btohqsg
yea my syllabus had dual comparison,btohqsg
like source A compare Source B...but you need to compare A with Source C as well,btohqsg
maybe same syllabus..but your batch lucked out,btohqsg
i thought kuro was younger than bedok sia,btohqsg
Oh yea..btw  did you see the source as the vacumn cleaner sucking in the money or releasing the money,btohqsg
if you said the money was being sucked in...you read that source wrongly,btohqsg
joined like early this yr only,btohqsg
bro 2nd patient i got had shortness of breath  like SPO2 going to 78 and covid 19,btohqsg
something worth keeping a memory of,btohqsg
how does it feel to be old,btohqsg
mothership pls post bout the case i went to,btohqsg
What happens after JC or poly?1) 21st bday celebrations!2) SG pools time! (Not recommended)3) Watch M18 and R21 movies,btohqsg
1) is going to be literally like any other birthday for most2) is......3) 4 SURE,btohqsg
What happens after graduation from poly or university?1) Gets bombarded by friends from the insurance industry.2) Attend Weddings after weddings3) Attend baby birthdays after birthdays,btohqsg
Not all are guys mah. Obvious ones lazy to write,btohqsg
so finish your diploma/a levels go find house,btohqsg
nah man we both same age,btohqsg
What happens after work a few years1) Buy house2) Ponder about how life sucks because not enough cash3) Work work work for $ and 😡4) Attend more weddings. Sigh at more red packets $$ going out5) More baby birthdays  more $$ going out6) More insurance look for you,btohqsg
Not my level yet. 60 year old uncle hear me say these before  then tell me:By his age  attend funerals after funerals.,btohqsg
not all have. Some of my friends have,btohqsg
i might go bald by the time i'm 30,btohqsg
Also have friends that undergo divorce,btohqsg
i've pulled out a lot of hair from stress in the past year,btohqsg
that's fast. Can become recruit again,btohqsg
i mean i look fine now but,btohqsg
one area like below my undercut look like receeding alr,btohqsg
buy a rope  tie to chin up bar below your house,btohqsg
But you married and alr own the house right,btohqsg
yea if you wanna win at being a fool,btohqsg
It’s a journey not a race bla bla bla,btohqsg
That’s the good part about being an adult lol,btohqsg
No I think JunWei is right,btohqsg
I see u so free on ps qns,btohqsg
Sometimes need to gongjiaowei when work slow,btohqsg
But unironically I think a lot of ppl need help/realistic perspective there ba,btohqsg
Too many ppl instagram and TikTok and whatever else until have no perspective,btohqsg
Work hard first few years  put into good investments  then relax,btohqsg
You not even in the group how come can see lol,btohqsg
oh no..girl is becoming a auntie,btohqsg
I see your profile like no common group in PSQ leh,btohqsg
What did you invest in since you’re like late 30s right,btohqsg
Now is not really personal but a family thing,btohqsg
Because finances are too intertwined with family survival. So no longer about personal finance,btohqsg
If consider just myself and wife  we have investments in stocks  corporate bond  as well as the standard T Bills and SSBs,btohqsg
Did you start in your 20s,btohqsg
Last time financial literacy and education was so crap prior to Covid  most content creators didn’t pivot to the space. Even now still got a lot of crap but there’s a few diamonds in the rough,btohqsg
If you invested back like more than 10 years ago salute to you sir,btohqsg
How did you find out about this back in the early 2010s or late 2000s,btohqsg
I even wrote a finance blog but didn't continue with it after a few years,btohqsg
I’m very sure if Mr Ben Felix didn’t start his YT channel I would not be investing or even if I did invest I would get burned then never invest or just buy ILP,btohqsg
I love the more academic approach he has,btohqsg
My whole life I had an adjacent interest in money making and finance but I didn’t look at it seriously  just more reading about money and some of the more entertaining things about macroeconomics and finance intersecting with politics and society,btohqsg
Then I think I found The Plain Bagel to explain economic concepts  then recommend to Ben Felix  his channel got me interested in the academic side of investing theory  so I read a bunch of books and papers.YT maybe has made me financially responsible person lol,btohqsg
i use youtube to learn about ASM and computer architecture 🙃,btohqsg
But even the choice to read rich dad poor dad you must have bought the book or someone give you right,btohqsg
ltr turnout to a haunted place,btohqsg
Now I'm at the stage where I want to up our dividends and bond returns to match our expenditure,btohqsg
started with then gf and now wife family home en bloc,btohqsg
fr bro i think so 💀,btohqsg
then we had that cash and then wondering what to do with it,btohqsg
cos i need nanosecond stability in my function call from my code for my experiment,btohqsg
so went to Google  and read up,btohqsg
I hated assembly class in Uni but now I realize it’s fascinating  but not enough for me to wanna learn it hahaha,btohqsg
last time it was all finance blogs,btohqsg
loading from RAM vs loading from L3 cache is the most jitter i get in my work,btohqsg
Nowadays feels like there’s a lot of good but a lot more trash mixed in to the online finance space,btohqsg
and somehow this is the shit i dive into despite my physics phd,btohqsg
Just curious  are the memory addresses for cache space and ram space different function calls in assembly,btohqsg
and find a style that suits you,btohqsg
bruh fk me i only know one call heap one call stack LOL,btohqsg
iirc cache are the ax to ex registers  now with up to their 512 bit variants  but i sus that memory is virtual memory addresses now  controlled by the kernel through paging,btohqsg
eg last few months did u invest in any,btohqsg
I’m the index funds only belief with slight beta tilt and slight US bias to value,btohqsg
Just use endowus  I open IBKR but I lazy to finish those due diligence stuff to make my first deposit there,btohqsg
Maybe once I hit 6 figure on endowus I go get serious about the brokerage,btohqsg
So the address space there’s no unique name convention to specifically add something to l3 cache ah,btohqsg
It’s all managed by the hardware alr?,btohqsg
Nowadays modern brokerage have lower fees tho,btohqsg
i think intel self chooses the L level caching ya  im still really new to this and i have to hop around on optimising so many different areas i haven't sat down to stare at this nanosecond thing in a while already,btohqsg
What’s the risk vs the one you use in your view,btohqsg
lower fees is because the brokerage is the custodian. In the rare situation that it fails  your $$ is as good as zero,btohqsg
thoughts on robo-advisors for a fresh-grad?,btohqsg
But this is true for any brokerage,btohqsg
Not for traditional brokerages in SG,btohqsg
If you don’t have the mental capacity to learn they’re a safe but lower return choice in my opinion,btohqsg
SG stocks are held in CDP. So if the brokerages closed down  the shares in the CDP is still yours,btohqsg
fair  ill definetly have to swap out of it once i have the mental space,btohqsg
you can use any of the brokerages to buy or sell it,btohqsg
I don’t mean that in like a “oh you can’t learn way” but that if you can make money thinking about your phd it’s more optimal to outsource your investing to robos,btohqsg
But that being said you can’t outsource all your thinking to any company even if they’re good companies,btohqsg
not like phd pay that good also 😝,btohqsg
Fair  but consider this ah:Some brokerages have longer history and deeper financial pockets and volume/customer base than the whole of SG finance space,btohqsg
now if invest  target is to beat 3%,btohqsg
So if they go down  relative to SGX go kaboom  everyone will be affected very significantly,btohqsg
Singapore also won’t survive such calamity,btohqsg
some banks also older and more established than SG and still fail,btohqsg
There is only 1 us securities exchange I know which did go bankrupt and it was a commodities exchange,btohqsg
And the customers are inconvenienced only,btohqsg
Cause the brokerages are all backed by us govt insurance,btohqsg
that's if you move your $$ to US.Then you become subject to potential policy changes,btohqsg
I guess? But then Singapore also subject to policy risk,btohqsg
In our investing history  Mahathir was the best example,btohqsg
And Singapore derives most of its FDI from the US,btohqsg
So we are married to them like it or not haha,btohqsg
Consider if you have 500k liquid investment  will you do that,btohqsg
ok I know Adam Khoo does that,btohqsg
Yes  my projection is to have all my money in a global portfolio which is managed by us brokerages,btohqsg
Until 40/50 then rebalance into less volatile assets,btohqsg
It's easy to consider rebalancing if there's profit,btohqsg
what if it's in the red  due to some recession. Are you still going to rebalance or hold on in hopes of making back then rebalance,btohqsg
and if so  what's the timeline for that,btohqsg
That’s why my investment style is don’t sell,btohqsg
personally I go for a style that pays dividends,btohqsg
If u dont sell the loss is nvr realized,btohqsg
my capital losses are reduced by the dividends return,btohqsg
This is only applicable under certain circumstances and strategies  which are not picking individual stock positions,btohqsg
Your total return is affected by dividends  but if the cash flow is what makes you psychologically able to take the risk it’s still better than not investing,btohqsg
those who bought SG etf at the 2007 peak are probably still at a loss or at most break even,btohqsg
Singapore exchange is a joke lol,btohqsg
My only SGx exposure comes from whatever the funds I invest in have in SG positions,btohqsg
it has probably given me a low returns of 5% including losses taken.,btohqsg
Better than CPF SA can liao,btohqsg
but SG is generally bad for the past 15 years.,btohqsg
"I know this is late..but the message was for the british people to tell them that dyson being in sg was not good because ""british pounds"" flew out showing dyson is wasting money being in singapore",btohqsg
SGX good for parking retirement funds and dividend collecting  but other than that I would stay away until you are old ah pek want to enjoy life in calm sg dividend withdrawal strategy,btohqsg
I play like old ah pek style 😂,btohqsg
"a Social studies paper  set in singapore..for a singapore national exam...and the answer is ""The message of the source is for the british public""",btohqsg
Aiya that’s ok la  better than ppl keep in kong guan tin,btohqsg
30k more to hit my personal soft target,btohqsg
Money is just potential value  needs to be in motion to have value. Loan it out  invest it  enjoy it,btohqsg
If not in bank account the bank enjoying it not you,btohqsg
Cannot be lost chasing the bag,btohqsg
95% of my liquid assets are in the market 😭,btohqsg
so I very poor to banks,btohqsg
Did you get the management associate consultant position,btohqsg
Tan ah kow Pte Ltd don’t bother,btohqsg
Even for MNC they don’t appreciate it or fast track you just move on with the skills you have,btohqsg
Either that or just take it slow and steady,btohqsg
If you not good enough to hustle just work your wage imo,btohqsg
Could mean nothing  there’s a lot of morons in god places and gods in moron places,btohqsg
True ah but i can leverage their connections somewhat,btohqsg
But so far they are very good,btohqsg
"Her dilenma is basically deciding on which subject she wants to ""drop""  chinese or Humanitiesshe has a tutor that teaches both chinese and humanities and she is going to decide based on the aforemention decision to direct her tutor to instead focus solely on the topic she decides not to drop likely.",btohqsg
Honestly happy with what im learning,btohqsg
double edged sword here..because she is borderlining on Humans and doing significantly better for chinese,btohqsg
My big boss was ex partner  so when i get to work with him i rly get to see things frm an elevated angle,btohqsg
Actually because Robo advisors are supposed to be an easy introduction into investing and charge percentage based fees it’s good for beginning investors to use them,btohqsg
Trade off is my wlb damn fcked,btohqsg
Then they get used to the ideas and learn  and develop a good habit  they can transition away or stay,btohqsg
Some robo-firms have better strategies and costs than others imo,btohqsg
Some straight up just waste of time,btohqsg
Others seem like they have good fundamental businesses,btohqsg
As long as you can actually leverage the experience I guess,btohqsg
I think i defo am ah,btohqsg
there are different strategies that can be employed when you have certain level of capital,btohqsg
Cause tbh when you interview at next company they won’t care your boss used to be from MBB  just what you accomplished,btohqsg
psq is a channel not group,btohqsg
For example I used to be working on a team which managed hundreds of millions of dollars in computer systems  one of my boss’s bosses/Individual contributor legit has 30 patents to his name and is just one of the kings of the company,btohqsg
Probably one of the smartest software guys in the world,btohqsg
But also didn’t matter to my current employer lol,btohqsg
What I did was what mattered,btohqsg
Sir pls watch Ben Felix on YT,btohqsg
So many ppl fundamentals of investing all screwed up from god knows what  I think movies or whatever,btohqsg
Ppl watch Wall Street and wolf of Wall Street,btohqsg
Think they’re shouting buy self buy sell on individual stocks,btohqsg
"right now your predicament...you are alr passing chinese  so just mantain that...but dont ""give up"" on humans  like just learn AQF(Answer Question First) and inference for all the SBQ's....still can get marks.Your tuition teacher should be redirected to chi as she can teach that subject better on you  since her way of teachning humans has not yielded you a pass",btohqsg
oh yea its a carpet cleaner,btohqsg
You only have 3 levers you can change in the equation.1. When you start.2. How much you pay someone to do the investments.3. What extent you diversify.,btohqsg
The rest is just as good as gravity,btohqsg
Pls watch Ben Felix  for personal finance education  legit one of the best YT channels I ever watched,btohqsg
Not many other channels I can say have the same kind of quality,btohqsg
He don’t sell u anything no promotions no sponsors,btohqsg
Just very specific and to the point of his view,btohqsg
Yes it can be  but as long as the world keeps producing value it is not,btohqsg
If got new iPhone next year I will make money,btohqsg
thats why its a pyramid scheme,btohqsg
If got HDB to buy next year I also make money,btohqsg
Doesn’t make sense to me to call it that  cause pyramid schemes are designed without the intention to grow sustainably,btohqsg
u step into shopping mall = help me make money,btohqsg
the world economy wont grow forever,btohqsg
When you invest responsibly you create value  which includes sustainable models of growth,btohqsg
I mean i can see it  capitalism in general is not sustainable since its built on exploitation of nature resources,btohqsg
only economists believe in infinite growth,btohqsg
Not my problem to worry about cause I only need it to survive another 100 years max,btohqsg
humans are so miniscule that the resources can be considered infinite,btohqsg
But pyramid scheme is usually characterized by need of exponential expansion  which makes it unsustainable,btohqsg
So while technically u can say that  it doesnt serve any purpose with respect to discussion,btohqsg
the stock market grows by % annually (roughly),btohqsg
Which comes from exploitation of natural resources,btohqsg
I think the real issue is typically down to the lack of value being transacted in the scheme or network.If there is value transacted the system can sustain. If not it is all consuming it collapses quickly.,btohqsg
I feel like this company should become a government agency at this point,btohqsg
Mhm ok thats a better differentiating factor,btohqsg
Islamic finance holds that Riba (interest) is haram,btohqsg
Literally Yishun Towing and EMAS...are the two most used towing companies,btohqsg
So all of their loans are just purchase agreements where the bank earns money on the sale of the asset to you  you make installments of a fixed rate,btohqsg
oh wait nvm...EMAss is govt contracted not this,btohqsg
But you still end up making money just like interest lol,btohqsg
wait..does SPF have a contract with this towing company,btohqsg
They just don’t call it interest  but many of the outcomes are like interest/debt obligations. However I do think some of their finance principles are kinder/less harsh.,btohqsg
I just can't do it the way it is taught in NS,btohqsg
I'll pull myself up as my boots slide down the rope  making use of the upwards force of friction to help propel me up,btohqsg
Sir this is LTA Emergency Motor assistance,btohqsg
oh yea so its a govt agency,btohqsg
I didn't have technique. So my method looks as though I'm pulling myself up by pure arm power when it's not,btohqsg
not a private one..like yishun towing,btohqsg
They only tow if you blocking a public road,btohqsg
And they tow to the clossst carpark only,btohqsg
oh then this towing company associated with the govt?,btohqsg
i see them always towing cars used for evidence in crimes or govt assets,btohqsg
Does it mean Emas cant tow a govt vehicle..if not there is a conflict of interest,btohqsg
i swear...our ecommerce ppl working overtime,btohqsg
What I planning to buy to ship over,btohqsg
i thought there would be a conflict of interest situation..like govt agency towing a broken govt vehicle,btohqsg
Government using government property to do government things not conflict of interest bro,btohqsg
It’s individuals using collective property for personal gain,btohqsg
Or when you are put in a situation where you can make a decision or have influence on the outcome of a process for your individual benefit,btohqsg
Here’s the difference ah:1. If I am a employee of a company  and I am able to make salary arrangements for ppl  and my family member is working under me  I give him high salary. Conflict of interest.,btohqsg
oh nvm...now i know what Emas is  cause i thought emas was responsible for towing your vehicle all the way to a workshop,btohqsg
2. If I am employee of a company but I can’t decide my family member salary. I just pass to him his cheque with his salary. Not a conflict of interest.,btohqsg
basically the difference is the intent,btohqsg
No eh  its more of authority,btohqsg
I mean it’s about the opportunity to show favor or get a personal gain when you should not have done so if it was a stranger,btohqsg
Shit phrasing but essentially it’s theft right,btohqsg
You use a situation to benefit yourself or someone you care about unfairly,btohqsg
If you can give increment or bonus to one guy but give your friend,btohqsg
I mean...the Govt agency can write a false report to say the govt vehicle is totaled when its not...then claim insurance,btohqsg
You should let someone who doesn’t know either people on personal level decide,btohqsg
And who is the one who gain,btohqsg
Government is a concept or system of people who collectively work to further their interests and their stakeholder interests (usually of a nation state),btohqsg
SG bois can't at all relate to this,btohqsg
It’s all tech or tech adjacent roles,btohqsg
Oh got nursing and early childhood also,btohqsg
This is like a given  every year nursing intake for polys keep increasing I thought,btohqsg
Good la  the number of ppl needed only going up also,btohqsg
Think I saw intake of 800 somewhere idk,btohqsg
A Grab driver in S'pore claimed he made S$2 500 to S$3 300 per week  or about S$11 200 a month.➡️https://bit.ly/3pOPgdOFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
time for me to be a grab driver,btohqsg
Before covid  taxi drivers easily earned 4K,btohqsg
if he works just a normal 9-5 or 8h/day,btohqsg
Also  we dk if he works every day or just 5 days a week. We also have not considered the depreciation of the car and the various costs of the owning a car,btohqsg
well lots of ppl own car and work 9-5 for much less pay,btohqsg
idt that many people earn 7k+ a month....,btohqsg
its like top 40% of sg ppl,btohqsg
so 60% of ppl earn less than that,btohqsg
not comparing w average grabfood deliveryperson,btohqsg
wont we just talking about what if grab drivers just work typical office hours tho,btohqsg
Taxi drivers' incomes were screwed the moment grab and all those booking apps came about,btohqsg
Gg yall I discharge from hospital,btohqsg
u would be surprised  alot earn abt 7k or less also buy car alr,btohqsg
"""not that many"" as in ""not majority""",btohqsg
Let's just put it this way. There are many avenues of income that are sometimes not officially recorded by many people.,btohqsg
u resell stuff on Carousell as a side hustle how to declare,btohqsg
there are also taxed ones  eg overseas income that are already taxed overseas,btohqsg
there are those who part time tuition while working ft,btohqsg
or depending how u see it  some would treat dividends or investment returns as part of income,btohqsg
u can do grab + smt else also,btohqsg
maybe 1 rich guy board ur grab,btohqsg
hv some trust in gdp figures,btohqsg
do u think its lower or higher,btohqsg
actually should dividends be considered as own incomenot going by govt definitions,btohqsg
because it's taxed at the company level,btohqsg
so not on personal level else double taxation,btohqsg
it's dividends from profits that are taxed,btohqsg
Wait but a  crane operator with more than 5 years of experience earns 8k,btohqsg
yea sia try get 4-5k fresh out of uni for healthcare,btohqsg
work hard save hard invest hard,btohqsg
