What use case are you planning to use the new card for? Citi rewards + amaze is generic enough to consider.,btohqsg
just for miles collection and to make use one of the singsaver deals and free lounge access,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/kGg8NtV7TeMFor lounge access cards  check Chris video. Simple cards like DBS altitude or Citi premier miles and u cross check with singsaver offer.,btohqsg

Hi All  as I have an upcoming surgery  I am currently looking to get a no cap CC (preferably with no min. spending) that can be use for HealthHub app and general spendings that HSBC Revol cant cover (ie Courts  Groceries (post-nerf)  SimplyGO etc.). Currently i am holding 3 CC; UOB Ladies (Dining) - HSBC Revol - UOB AMEX ABS (might cancel after the 0.3% local spending nerf kicks in)I have some options in mind. Appreciate if I could get some advice on the below:1) No miles expiry card (prefer with $1 block): Citi Premier Miles ; SCB JOURNEYS*altho its $5 block  maybe DBS Altitude too‚Ä¶?*or2) UOB Prvi Miles so i could pool together with UOB Ladies CC UOB$.Open to more options/advices if any.Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Based in My DBS experience  You need to login to your ibanking and do the transfer back to your CPF. Otherwise  the bank will transfer back to OA on certain date,btohqsg
then it should be in your CPF OA loh,btohqsg
I never check UOB webpage and now I know why. Thanks for the help!,btohqsg
You loose 1 month of CPF OA interest,btohqsg
hard way to learn the lesson but well just suck it,btohqsg
i think the btr question is why are u donating so much to them? hhahaha,btohqsg
Just keep rolling lo  so far it‚Äôs been a consistent 5.0x% for the past year,btohqsg
sounds abit contradicting if u are donating away so much and looking to earn from it. but that's my take which i am just curious,btohqsg
just curious why do you define those prior contents cum comments as ‚Äúunnecessary parts‚Äù though?,btohqsg
Just use AMEX True Cashback if you think the platinum is not worth it.,btohqsg
Don't think have any long term impact,btohqsg
As long as it is not excluded from the t&C  then ok (just no points),btohqsg
Citi rewards + amaze (check mcc is not excluded),btohqsg
kopitiam mcc is 5814 on fairprice app  should be fine,btohqsg
Is it need to login to bank investment account to do transfers to CPFOA by ourselves?,btohqsg
seems like it. I just initiated it and will see when they transfer in,btohqsg
Uob is so much easier. No nonsense like scb recently,btohqsg
Thank u very much. Seth has made that same suggestion as well. üôèüèª,btohqsg
The cashback only comes in the end of following month.,btohqsg
Yes. IA to OA need to self initiate transfer. It does not earn interest until the following month after transfering back to OA. And they will charge the transaction fee when you transfer.,btohqsg
Questions on POEMS account  whatever stocks I done through poems  it will be reflected on dashboard. But there are other stocks listed in CDP account. Can I syn the list from CDP to POEMS so I can have a consolidated view in POEMS?,btohqsg
"CPF pays interest based on the ""lowest"" balance of the month. So if you don't transfer back manually yourself and wait until the bank transfer for you  it may happen in the new months  so you loose the interest rate for that new month",btohqsg
Hi all  previously I applied for DBS woman card and I have DBS points there. I cancelled it about 3-4 months ago and totally forgot about the points  now when I check PayLah  the card and points are gone. Is it possible to call DBS hotline to request back the points or is it gone? :(,btohqsg
