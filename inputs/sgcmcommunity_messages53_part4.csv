In comparison  the gti has more mark up than the gp3. So u pay less but its also less bang for buck or less worth it,btohqsg

harlo guys. how do you DIY wrap ur car interior without heat gun or hair dryer since mscp dh plug,btohqsg
Sir.. Hao siang kinda missing 2 seats lehhhhh 😂,btohqsg
jcw also can throw in the mix,btohqsg
reliability wise cooper S is about the same as GTI right  i'd take GTI over that for the better cockpit and parts availability,btohqsg
haven't really considered mini  the centre panel a bit turn off for me,btohqsg
haha ya the screen abit too small for me if not i’d love the clubman s actually,btohqsg
that's a pretty good budget option,btohqsg
but i waiting for price to drop tbh  not worth to buy now,btohqsg
the new vrs can tune to 300hp 😍,btohqsg
don't think price will drop  only can wait for COE to drop,btohqsg
the so called experts say the coe won't go down for another year or 2,btohqsg

i watched them live recently. and did take an Ioniq5 to the concert (need to stay within the car theme in this channel otherwise kena kick to the KPOP IDOL channel then cham),btohqsg
The newer ones quite big  have iDrive 7,btohqsg
And can always upgrade it as well,btohqsg
like that i want bmw also haha,btohqsg
Ya probably. Bmw vs vw. But ya gti would have more parts availability  aftermarket and factory. Just a little plain vanilla for me,btohqsg
Not so budget anymore. Budget in today's terms but i refuse to pay that premium in this market,btohqsg
Or cupra? Got one ateca for sale now. U probably dont need the seats and space  but dont have any leon st or the formentor for sale,btohqsg
Ya it is  only the 冷门 brands offer better value now,btohqsg
Still cant believe a coe megane rs is only asking 10k depre,btohqsg
The rcz also asling 10k depre  but that one a bit too extreme,btohqsg
rcz a bit too niche liao,btohqsg
Also too many owners for comfort,btohqsg
