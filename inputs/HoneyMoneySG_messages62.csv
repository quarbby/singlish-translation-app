if offline use contactless cards like uob ppv/vs  if online use online card like dbs wwmc/citi rewards,btohqsg
I remember it is stated clearly what is excluded in TnC. You may want to take a look at TnC.,btohqsg
i see. i always had the idea that its only excluded from the $800 min spend  required for higher cashback.,btohqsg
cardup excluded from $500 for quarterly rebate and also $500 for bonus interest,btohqsg
ahh ok. means i paid the additional cardup fee for nothing haha,btohqsg
Does anyone knows if DBS WWMC offers 0% installment for online purchase?,btohqsg
Lesson learnt- whenever making big purchase/transaction  always read TnC yourself. If TnC stated yes  it becomes a document that can support you when you call CSO to ask for missing rewards.Any answer you get from chat group can‚Äôt support you.,btohqsg

Tbh I received something but I can't make sense of it. Hence why I was poking around...,btohqsg
Mine was Mar-June period  Reference Feb.Bonus Interest credited in today (seems like its for March only)Expected $198.12 @ 4.5%Got $198.12EDIT: numbers are correct,btohqsg
did you have a GIRO deduction on 17th Aug?,btohqsg
Nope I just park money there only,btohqsg
hmm strange. what is the description of the amount you received on 18th Aug?,btohqsg
Mine too  seems like only for the first month. I am really hoping that the next few months will come soon  otherwise I gonna be üò°.,btohqsg
u sure u calculated correctly incremental average daily balance wrt Feb yah?,btohqsg
So far it's only 1% that came in.,btohqsg
the rest supposed to come in by end Aug,btohqsg
I think for month of March 2023 only so far  also slightly less than expected vs Feb balance at $0,btohqsg
so far i able to compute and get exact amount,btohqsg
check your statement  there is a Total Relationship Balance for every month which is the monthly daily average,btohqsg
You mean ADB (Average Daily Balance) for the month ?,btohqsg
yes average daily balance. it's shown in the statement as Total Relationship Balance,btohqsg

Feb $0  I calculated daily.Counted deposit on the day itself before midnight for interest.Withdrawal amounts before midnight wont earn on that dateWill check against the statement as advised by@sgwhisperer,btohqsg
I also just got my March interest. I got the interest HSBC promoted.,btohqsg
I got my HSBC EGA interest for March 2023 today. It matches my own calculations (in fact a few dollars more)Remember that it is for (March 2023 ADB - February's ADB). x 4.x%,btohqsg
just some up all the daily end of day balance and then divide by the number of days in the month,btohqsg
i think should be correct.. maybe got some days you moved in money past the cut off timing or weekend not counted... etc...or day count convention thing,btohqsg

existing is ironically easier to hit 3.55% p.a. compared to new customer (more TNC to watch).https://www.cimb.com.sg/savings2?cid=a1:pb_a2:casa_a3:CASA-AUG-3.5_a4:080823_a5:pmax_a6:go_a7:cmpgn_a8:rb1&dclid=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwuZGnBhD1ARIsACxbAVg0dWlFSB-P3j9DLc-Uf-kGvtgLg4Tn73g2Qv9AXAwoShqhxd2GdjYaAgF6EALw_wcB#Existing%20Customers%20,btohqsg
So I won‚Äôt earn that much in Sep if I put the funds in this month,btohqsg
for EXISTING customers  the KEY figure is your 31st July DAY END balance...Incremental balance is compared against THAT static figure,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs ok if I transfer most of my funds now if my 31st July balance is fairly low?,btohqsg
i don't know what is your definition of low..If your 31st July DAY END balance is $1000  then EVERYTHING above $1k will earn 3.55% p.a.,btohqsg

just move 100k over from OCBC 360 to UOB One on the 1st of the month,btohqsg
assuming you already got your UOB Card and ready to spend,btohqsg
The spend criteria is based on calendar month so no need to consider billing cycle,btohqsg

For those who successfully setup UOB cc bill payment using giro to HSBC EGA were there any notifications once the giro setup was completed?,btohqsg
HSBC April bonus interest is in~,btohqsg
When GIRO setup completed is not important. Most Important is if there is a GIRO payment instructions printed on the credit card statement or not.Read thishttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/95726,btohqsg
sigh nothing for me... i am on alternate months so I will only get March and May bonus interest.,btohqsg
you MUST wait for your credit card statement to have the GIRO comment under Payment section before it is deemed completed,btohqsg
update:its correct based on statement  but statement itself is wrong.I deposited a few amounts since 11 March  but the transactions from 11-12 March are shown as 13 March on HSBC statement.(Checked tx dates on DBS account where the funds were transferred from).If i update my calculations based on that then its correctSo its like S$12.68 difference if they were counted on the actual dates,btohqsg
weekend deposits aren't calculated till the next working day?,btohqsg
some banks count some banks don't..my brain is not big enough to remember who does..so I always assume cutoff timing of 10am Saturday and it has never failed me,btohqsg

Anyone knows how to change IRAS Giro monthly payment from OCBC or DBS to UOB bank acc? IRAS says don't need to terminate and just apply with UOB Internet Banking  whereas UOB Internet Banking indicate that need to terminate existing giro arrangements and wait for 30 days then applying to UOB Internet Banking. But I recall seeing on IRAS website that if we terminate the monthly giro arrangement IRAS will require full payment immediately.,btohqsg
my understanding is that new giro arrangement will supercede the old one.. so not sure why need to terminate and wait 30 days before re-applying.. doesn't make sense to me,btohqsg

If it‚Äôs different banks  dbs to ocbc you can select as SALA or payroll. But if it‚Äôs dbs to dbs  in the comments section you can just put Jul‚Äô23 Salary.  Pay now and giro fees are different for DBS corporate accounts I think.,btohqsg
If you need help you can drop me a text but so far when I wire transfer to my employees  it‚Äôs mostly DBS or OCBC account.,btohqsg

Ah so technically you can get a supp card and then enjoy a ‚Äú2k‚Äù cap yes,btohqsg
Around 200-250 will be card spending,btohqsg
Meaning your spending will only be 200-250  if can convert more of your cash/nets spending to card will be good. E.g. using XNAP at hawker so it will use card instead of cash/paylah.,btohqsg
With this low spending  you won't hit the min spending of most high cashback cards. So the best you can go for is UOB Absolute Cashback AMEX at 1.7% or Citi Cash Back+ Mastercard at 1.6%.For bank account  OCBC 360 Savings will work for you since you spend less  assuming you don't succumb to lifestyle inflation.Salary credit of at least 1.8k gives 2% p.a. (first 75k) and having $500 increase in average daily balance in account monthly gives 1.2% p.a. (first 25k)/2.4% p.a. (next 25k).,btohqsg
But once you hit consistent $600 spending  move to UOB One Account and UOB EVOL VISA Card. 3.85% p.a. for first 30k.,btohqsg
Icic thanks a lot for ur advice!!üôèüôè,btohqsg
Currently I‚Äôm using Stan chart‚Äôs jumpstart account which gives a flat 2% pa for the first 20k only  so I should switch to OCBC 360 account once I start work?,btohqsg
Suggest you keep track of your expenses/budget using an app/excel sheet. Also put an indicator if its cash/paynow/nets or credit card.And read up on card t&cs if unsure about what is excluded.,btohqsg
Does anyone know which are the best non-AMEX cards to pay for education/school fees?,btohqsg
Hi  if I have UOB ONE card as well  will I be able to get cashback from both cards? does it work that way?,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚Äúschool card‚Äù or ‚Äúeducation card‚Äù to search chat history to see what other reply.,btohqsg
Do you guys use Revolut stock exchange  IBKR  Syfe  tiger brokers or moo moo to buy stocks and etfs? Can someone kindly advice me?,btohqsg
Like will I get cashbacks from both cards?,btohqsg
yes if u met the spending requirements for both card,btohqsg
You mean you have both UOB EVOL and UOB ONE cards? Then make sure you hit your eligible spending for both cards lor.. UOB EVOL's 600 + UOB ONE's 500/1000/2000.,btohqsg
thinking of getting EVOL too. both cards need to hit eligible spending for 3 consecutive months then will get cashback right?,btohqsg
Read the t&cs for each card's minimum spending  how the cashback works and their exclusions.,btohqsg
Anyone notice that UOB TMRW does not allow u to track bonus interest milestone anymore?,btohqsg

if you want to be kiasu like me  you could live chat UOB and ask them to manually confirm that everything is ok for your account.I honestly think it is justified because they are actually quite late (usually 15th of the month based on past cycles).I know offiically it is 31st August  but IF YOU MISS IT (whether honest mistake or you made an error)  it is too late if you try to rectify it on 1st Sep.P.S. this one not hack or what... it is OK to check with CSOs.. hahahaha,btohqsg

You can't withdraw until bonus arrives. Few hours after i received that message then bonus arrived,btohqsg

Ah okay. I always pay on time. Just to check  by full so you mean the due amount for that month or the total amount?,btohqsg
For the credit score purpose and avoid interest  Full for that statement month. But for my own practice  if the total amount is not a lot of difference  I paid all.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt full for the statement month just the due amount?,btohqsg
This comment is true if you apply too many consecutively.e.g. apply UOB  CIMB  DBS  SCB all in one month. Deemed as desperate borrower.However  if you applyJanuary UOBMarch CIMBMay DBSJuly SCBno issue one.,btohqsg

For UOB lady‚Äôs  6mpd for every $5  does it mean that I only get 6 miles for $9.95 purchase? Whereas for HSBC Revo I get 9X4= 36 miles for the same purchase?,btohqsg
0.4mpd (1x point) based on $5 blocks per transaction3.6mpd (9x bonus points) = round down to nearest whole ((sum of eligible spending in calendar month)/5√ó9)2mpd (5x bonus points) = round down to nearest whole ((sum of eligible spending in calendar month)/5√ó5),btohqsg
As found in a previous message sent here,btohqsg
If i use 100x $4.99 transactions  no points?,btohqsg
$5 x 6 miles = 30 miles,btohqsg
So actually for low purchase not worthwhile using uob,btohqsg
assuming all your 4.99 txns belong to your selected bonus category for uob lady's  you'll get 5.6mpd*495,btohqsg
For SimplyGo  bus and mrt  it is calculated per trip or per month?,btohqsg
Uob lady's is $5 block rite?,btohqsg
the example was 100x transactions  so total would be $499,btohqsg
It‚Äôs 5 block but milelion state that they will add everything together at the end of every statement. ( I think )So if u spend 999 it would be rounded down to 995 and u get the miles for 995,btohqsg

Hi all :) I would like to ask for the UOB EVOL card. Does spending at UOB$ merchants count towards the $600 minimum card spend required?There are also some UOB $ merchants that only award UOB$ cashback with a minimum spend criteria (e.g. giant min spend $50). So if I spent only $5  and since I won‚Äôt be getting UOB$ cashback  will I still get 8% mobile contactless or 0.3% all other spend cashback or nothing?Thanks in advance! :),btohqsg
for uob one cc  the spending of $500 per month is there merchants to be qualified? or i can just simply paywave or applepay any merchant,btohqsg
so long not in exclusion list in the TnC,btohqsg

Citibank is the only one who goes around telling customers MAX 5 credit cards per customer.Never heard of UOB having such a rule.That being said  one of my humans has:1. UOB One2. UOB Evol3. UOB Lady4. UOB Visa Signature5. UOB Absolute6. UOB PPV7. UOB Krisflyer8. UOB PRVI Amexso definitely not max of 2 cards for UOB customers.,btohqsg
It is not grey. Count for min spend  but don't earn any cashback.,btohqsg
Based on personal experience  and so far all DPs from other people support this argument.,btohqsg
yes  I have the same experience  but my last read in tnc say no  that's why I say grey,btohqsg
Based on t&c  you will get the cashback if you are still within cashback limit. It will also be counted as eligible spending.Only the transactions that were rewarded with UOB$ will not be counted as eligible spending nor it will be rewarded cashback.Simple black and white English.

Shall wait for the next working day to update again.,btohqsg
Thanks for the response :) So if I understand correctly  if I already spent $250 on mobile contactless and spend another $5 at Giant  I will earn 0.3% cashback?Cause I saw an 2 year old article whereby in the same situation the person was awarded 0% cashback. Can‚Äôt link or send photo here. Article is ‚ÄúNerfed/Buffed: UOB$ Programme Quietly Excluded For UOB EVOL  But Might Offer Extra Rebates for UOB One‚Äù,btohqsg
Honestly I also want to know if the eligible spending that exceeded the cashback limit will be counted as 0.3% or not. But then again  it's so negligible I won't bother about the 0.3% and just switch to another card for the 5%/3%/1.7% if I have to.Based on UOB EVOL T&C  it still states UOB$ awarded transactions as part of exclusion  so I will just assume that it is still valid.,btohqsg

Will fail the increase in total balance condition.,btohqsg
The comparison date/balance is 30th June day end balance.,btohqsg
Yeap I understand. So I just have to trf it out on the 29th June correct? So assuming I got 105k. I trf out 100k means 30th June end day balance is 5k. Then on 1 sept I trf back in 100k. So will that be considered? Haha sorry I‚Äôm a noob on this as I‚Äôve never done this before. But thanks for explaining!,btohqsg
Yes correct.But now is august. U cannot turn back time to 30th June anymore.,btohqsg
Oh sorry I meant I trf out on 29th august! Cause I see that for the month of September still can participate. Or can I only participate in July and I won‚Äôt be able to participate for sept anymore,btohqsg
Yes I know this was where u heading.That‚Äôs the problem. No matter u want to participate in July august or September  uob will still compare against 30th June balance.So u move out on 29th august also useless.,btohqsg

This is a very good question and one that I honestly don't have a 100% accurate answer to.My feel is banks are only getting more and more conservative these days and the past approvals we saw of luxurious and generous credit limits may be over.With more banks learning how to read the Credit Bureau report more accurately  and with the general feel that economy is getting worse and job retrenchments hitting anybody anytime  my feel is the Credit Departments of the major banks have only grow more conservative over the years.Banks will typically not disturb whatever limits that had been granted in the past unless you specifically submit documents and trigger a credit limit review.And I still have the belief that one should not cancel limits that have already been approved because you may not even get back the same limit approved in the future even if you re apply with higher income than in the past.,btohqsg
Those of you in the DBS / ANZ credit card merge era will remember how DBS did it... rather incredulous in my view...DBS ADDED the credit limit that ANZ given to the customer  WITH NO CAP.So if your DBS limit was $200k and your ANZ limit was $150k... your new DBS limit was $350k i kid you not.,btohqsg

Hi all  I just got my citi rewards approval yesterday. The email said that I could start using the digital credit card on the citi mobile app. Tried doing it but keep getting error signs lol. Is there something I‚Äôm missing here,btohqsg
In fact 55 FRS amount goes to RA  and interest compound and sit inside RA is bad enough. The only saving grace is CPF LIFE technically is forever. But have to live a very long life  maybe after 83/84 to break even,btohqsg
Capital preservation is priority. Maybe low risk options like ssb tbills,btohqsg
And as Singaporean life span get longer  the CPF LIFE payout amount in future could also be reduced. This is from CPF website. I thought that statement is quite bad.,btohqsg

If I Direct use linked credit card  is there any extra charges if spend in foreign currency?,btohqsg
But to be fair  this one is different from buying the bonds outright  as for chocolate finance  you don't own the bonds. When things go sideways  you basically own nothing except a chocolate finance deposit record.,btohqsg
U own bond funds so bond funds prices can go up or down.,btohqsg
U own the bond funds.Assets should be segregated from chocolate finance unless there is fraud.,btohqsg
But to be fair speaking  how are they able to offer u the interest rate they posted. They must use the depositor money to invest in somewhere too right. So even if it is in custodian bank account  it have to be put into an invesment vehicle that earn more from what they are giving depositor,btohqsg
This is completely different from bank system  whereby bank have to put a portion of their liquid cash with MAS and there is sdic is to protect money (75k) when u deposit with bank for fd.,btohqsg
Money dont fall from sky  it have to come from somewhere  so i definitely wont be parking with them even if the rate is good  especially after they claim that just because money is park with custodian bank  it is safe.,btohqsg
They take your cash to buy bond funds. Not put into savings accounts.There is no profit guarantee other than the first x small amount.,btohqsg
What i am saying is  i dont trust a finance company who claim money is safe,btohqsg
All invesment carry risk  low or high.Even no risk such as bank also carry inflation risk when u deposit with them.,btohqsg
Only first $20k had 4.5% guaranteed by them. Beyond that nothing is guaranteed.,btohqsg
I am not referring to the first 20k but their promised of money is safe when the company closes,btohqsg
I think the refer of custodian bank only promised the money inside wont be used as their aaset to repay debtor if they do wind up. But all investment should carry risk,btohqsg
However  people could mistake it as their capital is safe= principle guarantee if it is misinterpret.,btohqsg
Inorder to give 4.5 percent or 3.5 percent  the company itself have to invesment in higher risk bond themselves inorder to give depositer the money.Even if we say the safer us treasury 5 percent  they still have to bear foreign currency exchange risk. So for all investor  u need to ask yourself how they able to payout the high interest and is it sustainable.,btohqsg
"Hi  this may sound like a dumb/troll question but it is not. I have an Uniplus account with UOB. However  I noticed the card they recently sent me (old card expiring soon) has this UOB One Visa design. Does that mean i am ""enrolled"" with this UOB One account?",btohqsg
Actually it is not difficult to get over 4% pa yield if U buy sgd bonds.Chocolate promised 4.5% on first $20k. Rest is target 3.5%.,btohqsg
They have to earn too  further more unlike if u invest in fund or bond fund  u dont know the composition of the investment vehicle they invest in. Each to their own lah. If u want to park money with them then it is you choice.,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt park with them because I rather buy the bonds myself‚Ä¶.,btohqsg

Can u elaborate?From what I understand if u die early u get back a significant amount of premium paid.,btohqsg
Based on my layman's understanding  someone can correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.The moment you hit 55  the RA account is formed and the FRS amount is transferred to your RA account. From 55 to 65  your RA will continue to earn interest. At 65 your payout from CPF LIFE will start.Your interest technically goes to a common pool to form the annuity as such collectively everyone shares the common pool.If you pass away before the ‚Äúbreak-even‚Äù age  your unused mount will be bequest but not your interest.If you pass away after the ‚Äúbreak-even‚Äù age  technically your principal and interest earned will be more than your total payout from 65 onwards.Someone did the math to be around 83/84 depending on the plan you choose. There are 3 CPF LIFE plans  basic  standard and escalating.,btohqsg
I think long ago there was some complaint about the 10 years of missing RA interest.I‚Äôm not sure how they resolved it. Whether the interest is earned now but goes to common pool. Or interest is earned now but goes to u.I think they fixed it such that interest on RA for the 10 years still belongs to u.,btohqsg
If I read Ts and Cs  for new account  the reqt is for current month last-day balance to be more than last month's last-day balance  but the 3.5% interest will be applied on whole amount  not just incremental balance?,btohqsg
I think got illustrative table. Just follow that should be correct.I‚Äôm existing customer so I didn‚Äôt pay too much attention for new customer. I know existing was easier than new customer.,btohqsg
