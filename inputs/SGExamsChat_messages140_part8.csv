They make me feel tongue tied too,btohqsg
But i really wanted to learn canto For so long alr,btohqsg
I think for singaporeans what is tough for cantonese is reading 想、張 etc as they have the -eung suffix which is harder to pronounce.,btohqsg
My family can't pronounce it properly,btohqsg
You want me to recommend you my teacher?It's about $20 for 50 minutes for a 1-1 session. Cheaper than 1-1 tuition in general  haha,btohqsg
There are also cheaper teachers out there,btohqsg
I just wanna learn it from my mom,btohqsg
I dun wanna incur extra expenditure,btohqsg
Okay. It's just that there's an issue I find with singaporean cantonese. Complex ideas is hard to put across. Sometimes I want to have a good and very complex discussion. Many singaporeans seem to noy understand when I start using complex vocabulary in Cantonese. Maybe it exists but the general populace don't really encounter such things,btohqsg
I wanna learn from mom cos i need real life,btohqsg
Maybe the singaporean cantonese is not that complex yet,btohqsg
Anyway not many canto speakers around i feel :/,btohqsg
Compared to hokkien and teochew ppl in sg,btohqsg
That's only one way. Not two ways. So your pronunciation and usage cannot be corrected,btohqsg
Two way convo learn super fast,btohqsg
My mom will correct me on the spot,btohqsg
Even with Singaporeans Min nan I find it limiting from what I hear people say. I can understand it but I can't speak it.I don't like the term hokkien as it means 福建. Foochownese don't speak the hokkien that you think,btohqsg
And even tell me how our tongue should slur,btohqsg
潮汕话 and 闽南话 is very similar,btohqsg
Actually it is called min nan yu right? Not hokkie right?,btohqsg
Yes  in 闽南话 it is read.Man Nam Wei,btohqsg
Mandarin has way more tongue twisters. For example 那儿 is read Na-r as one syllable.哈尔滨 is red Ha-r- bin as two syllables. By the way  the name harbin is actually manchu  not chineseYour tongue has to bend.,btohqsg
In the north of china  many people say zhei ge for 这个 and nei ge for 那个,btohqsg
Because it is next door to each other. Lingustically chaozhou/teochew and shantou/swatowis closer to the south of fujian than the rest of guangdong,btohqsg
No.. it is called 粤东地区. In this area there is 梅州/梅县 which is a very hakka place,btohqsg
I have been to chaozhou and shantou and xiamen myself,btohqsg
But chaozhou and shantou don't have many international tourists and it's not very modern.,btohqsg
Wuhan used to be three cities.  汉口、汉阳、武昌. Merged by the ROC government to become wuhan,btohqsg
I have poly friend from wuhan too,btohqsg
