This has taken a serious turn,btohqsg
Y'all really love your nsf lives,btohqsg
Gotta love spending 6hrs on html,btohqsg
someone got a early christmas present,btohqsg
hey guys   please be aware of the surroundings arnd u at all times. someone in my sch was targeted ytd:,btohqsg
@chemceroi ASA RECOOT got nothing better to do isit,btohqsg
Ah yea a foreigner that brought his foreign lifestyle to sg without thinking‚Ä¶ I think to him this is normal,btohqsg
ya lor. what kind of shit ass lifestyle,btohqsg
But bro dumb as fuck‚Ä¶ wear light green and brown pants. Stand out like a sore thumb,btohqsg
"is the ""fi"". what do u expect",btohqsg
it‚Äôs always those foreigners. thats why im against immigration,btohqsg
I saw that vid of a few tourist visiting a beach in India‚Ä¶  so many men and women stared at them till the point they can‚Äôt even see the water,btohqsg
me too! I've been fighting with them for yrs in my estate,btohqsg
they threatened q a few police report on me. yet im still here,btohqsg
Here is a interesting fact abt foreigner coming to Singapore and why there was a sudden influx,btohqsg
that 's what drives up xenophobia,btohqsg
The government decided to open the foreign talent floodgates in the mid 90s,btohqsg
"i thought in 2000s. the f ""ft"" scheme.",btohqsg
By the 2000s  this scheme they had just propelled more,btohqsg
But the decision to introduce more foreign talent happened in the 90s,btohqsg
Yea it‚Äôs literally the lawless ness that these foreign talent has been bringing to sg,btohqsg
40 percent of Singapore‚Äôs population are foreigners,btohqsg
Lmao sg government don‚Äôt like you,btohqsg
Oh yea btw from the paragraph I just sent notice the keyword?,btohqsg
These means the government just wanted more people,btohqsg
yea but tbh i‚Äôm only against immigration because of all the disgusting shit that they stir up in other countries,btohqsg
I agree. last time I heard abt the Swedish against Moroccan children attacking them in the city centre. that ‚Äòs a product from immigration,btohqsg
i‚Äôve heard of the 2015-16 european migrant crisis where immigrants from africa/middle east (who were fleeing war) went to france and started a shooting  went to germany and sexually assaulted people,btohqsg
now it looks like we are on that path as well,btohqsg
time to take up self-defence class,btohqsg
im in my poly‚Äôs archery ccacan shoot people with arrow as self defense üòÄ,btohqsg
I can only imagine a shooting that happens in singapore,btohqsg
maybe like jp. results of being overly sheltered,btohqsg
remember the river valley high school attack1 student got killed by an axe and it already made the whole country shake,btohqsg
meanwhile america has school shootings so frequently with way more than 1 person killed,btohqsg
There is so many instances of emergency that have yet to happen to Singapore in recent times‚Ä¶it will be really intresting how we will react,btohqsg
Like a mass shooting  building collapse,btohqsg
Is scdf ready to face a building collapse,btohqsg
u gt see the two recent attacks (one successful / failed) ? the ppl there do not how to react,btohqsg
not used to it most likely,btohqsg
these kind of incidents are very rare,btohqsg
I rmb abt a article on a fire on a offshore island,btohqsg
They legit had to transport fire trucks on barges,btohqsg
To send them to the island to continue battling the flame,btohqsg
It‚Äôs unique instances like this that really make me wonder how we are going to react,btohqsg
And whether our response is capable,btohqsg
i know CECAü§£. all come with chapalang uni cert then steal our jobs,btohqsg
The shit that surprised me was the assasination,btohqsg
A homemade shotgun that could kill?,btohqsg
its so funny lolim still laughing,btohqsg
Yea I know but rarely does it involved a firearm from what I believe,btohqsg
The fact is that it was a homemade weapon,btohqsg
Yea the anthrax shit was deadly,btohqsg
But bro had a cult without it I doubt you could pull it off,btohqsg
Lmao last minute decision prob changed that person‚Äôs life,btohqsg
Hijackers planned to seek asylum in Cuba‚Ä¶but plane could not fly to cuba.So their next best option was North Korea and they were granted asylum in North Korea,btohqsg
That is some last minute 0iq thinking,btohqsg
Legend has it that Kento Bento is still making that part 2,btohqsg
most of Tesla's value is speculation anyways. a bubble waiting to burst,btohqsg
isit cuz of the china recall?,btohqsg
and also US economy is in shambles. we have a 50-50 chance of recession this decade. Investors don't have confidence,btohqsg
alot of them are shorting SNP500,btohqsg
oh yeaaa. some alr said we r in reccession,btohqsg
coupled together with finite lithium supplies,btohqsg
cant rmb but the jp morgan ceo said smth that we r gg to reccesion soon haha,btohqsg
not really  mostly the West. European nations and US are facing around 10-15% inflation. and sgreans complain about 3% ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Singapore still safe. considering most of our economy is tied to China and not the west. but if China and US proceed to do some funny funny thing  SG confirm fucked the hardest,btohqsg
time to buy intel stocks folks,btohqsg
should be within that range. 3-4% is healthy inflation. Not too little to show no economic growth and not too much to show weak currency,btohqsg
buy Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. US preparing for war on 2 fronts. Stocks will rise and will earn $$$ if no war happens. If WW3 happens  you wouldn't need the money anyways ü§£,btohqsg
anyways ah  I need help for O lvl combined Chem. I understand got alot of stuff must brute force memorize like solubility etc etc. if anyone got simplified notes or tips to remember the content  please send me üôèüôè,btohqsg
Zoom out for the 2 year chart its gonna be even worse,btohqsg
oh yea nah must wait for US to fuck up,btohqsg
Random qn how many of y'all useIntel or AMD,btohqsg
yeah I can understand when I'm reading the notes and doing questions but the moment my notes gone I cannot do anything alr. from Acid  bases  salt onwards gg liao,btohqsg
these you need to actually do practicals to understand them more,btohqsg
problem is I private candidate lol. last year I supposed take O level but I knew I was gonna F9 anyways,btohqsg
school didn't even want to take me back,btohqsg
and I wanted to go SAF diploma scholarship. bopian now I need to compress 4 year of learning into 1,btohqsg
I was gonna say u can join my support grp for pc,btohqsg
there are q alot of them retaking. I have been helping the PC support since...the time I graduated from being one myself hahaha,btohqsg
Mostly they are my class of 2023 ah,btohqsg
I would appreciate any help I can get. good news for me is I only retaking 3 subjects. struggling in chem the most,btohqsg
And ofc w the help of other teachers,btohqsg
2022: English C6  Economics A2  SS/HH B42023: English  Phys/chem  E math,btohqsg
funny thing is I promoted from Sec3-Sec4 express with a overall percentage of like 20-30%,btohqsg
woah what‚Äôs going on here neko,btohqsg
yeah it‚Äôs fine i flopped sec 3 almost all F9 now I‚Äôm in poly üòã coping or not that one different@Voidchords,btohqsg
no idea what‚Äôs that so i shall kick myself out again,btohqsg
had a friend got straight A for O level ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
worst part is he was a PC. Paid $800 because he's PR and additional few K for tuition he never went,btohqsg
I am well prepared. but Singapore living costs too expensive. need that damn scholarshipüò≠üò≠,btohqsg
that one need take aerospace engineering liao.,btohqsg
no interest. I will 3 year suffer,btohqsg

50% of the time we wish for CAT 1 it actually came,btohqsg
but with the back of a 5-tonner,btohqsg
nowadays saf mostly uses the 5 tonner,btohqsg
likely the 3 tonners have already been phased out,btohqsg
10+ years ago I already didn't sit on 3 tonners,btohqsg
only sat on them during my nsf days which was 2002 to 2004,btohqsg
tbh i actually enjoyed it üóø,btohqsg

btw does anyone wanna guess what this translates into?,btohqsg
Is that a texture for a 3d model lol,btohqsg
Ah ic I forgor all my blender knowledge,btohqsg
Damn did you make the model yourself? Looks good,btohqsg

so you can enjoy various diff cars ngl,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a running joke in some of ppl i know in tp. They just fill up the drop out form and save it,btohqsg
When it gets too tough  they jut submit it,btohqsg
i was about to say that sg car insurance is expensivegerman cars are particularly expensive,btohqsg

I can attest to this coz I got a drop out form filled,btohqsg
not forgetting renew coe need to pay more rd tax every year also,btohqsg
thats why my dad stopped drivingso freaking expensive bro,btohqsg

You see I just reverse psychiatry myself to just tahan,btohqsg

sian what to do? moi is sinkie...shud be feeling privileged to serveüòÇ,btohqsg
"then my ex-cop father was like ""no way""",btohqsg
i wonder what is the car insurance in americamust be really cheap because the people there are always driving,btohqsg
Idk what will happen with NS now,btohqsg
but here i keep seeing cars being driven without road tax being paid,btohqsg
just dun get caught lor. but most likely no insurance also,btohqsg
i k last time for my parents car abt 2k ish for a toyota,btohqsg
the thing is...you cant park anywhere in a hdb carpark without paying roadtax,btohqsg
so where do these roadtax evaders park their cars,btohqsg
u can if u not caught,btohqsg
i thought there was a system in place that prevents you parking in a hdb carpark,btohqsg
gantry system just use the IU what no?,btohqsg
Get my Malay TOs to drive us ard,btohqsg
you know i just thought of a unconventional way you can buy and sell. What about buying a extremely cheap modified car then taking off the parts and selling them individually,btohqsg
thats what some do... but usually those with ex parts dekit first,btohqsg
i had a math question about cars and my math lecturer was saying that every year in sg your car‚Äôs value decreases by 10/20%that‚Äôs so sad,btohqsg
Hahahha  they know how to keng the paperwork so I wouldn't even bother,btohqsg
car is a wealth killer in sg,btohqsg
but there is the vehicle preserving scheme,btohqsg
fr siawhy so expensive for what,btohqsg
coe and arf lor. and the other small taxes here n there,btohqsg
But even tho it‚Äôs ac cfm will be like hot also,btohqsg
i have an a/c in my room but,btohqsg

oh renewed 5 year coe one ah,btohqsg
I wanna cycle all over SG after I ORD,btohqsg
sian i wan to own type r,btohqsg
no car from 2008..unlikely 5 years coe,btohqsg
I wanna drive too but only if I got the money,btohqsg
Coz I wouldn‚Äôt mind doing night drives or driving over to my friends place then we go out,btohqsg
need to squeeze money out and take 70% loan for 7 years,btohqsg
my friend found a car for 50/day on carousell,btohqsg

I‚Äôm literally the person that‚Äôs like,btohqsg

i just like how cars look,btohqsg
damn the admin has a picture of his sec sch hall for o/n levels lol,btohqsg
That is in less than 1 yr 6mths,btohqsg
Tbh the ppl ard me  their biggest concern was what if I was send to do those like dead ppl things,btohqsg
lmao this person just said fk it...ima list a random price,btohqsg
when you see a price that ends with .000  you know it was a random guess,btohqsg
But like I honestly don‚Äôt mind dead ppl,btohqsg
bro i was looking at r/singapore or something (i forgot the subreddit name) and a 12 year old student did something which caused the nsl mrt to delay and he was a train enthusiast or something,btohqsg
I rather see dead ppl than living,btohqsg
yea  the intresting this is that...these ppl are not new,btohqsg
thats why some bus interchange will stop bus spotters,btohqsg
I‚Äôve seen a dead body once,btohqsg
Coz some lady decided to jump off my blk,btohqsg
same  saw one of a reddit post,btohqsg
I sweat in my soul ‚Äúoooo dead body‚Äù,btohqsg
u wont want to...dad had a friend who was in navy  had to pick up dead body from sea  arm fell off and he fell sick for a week,btohqsg
Tho there wasn‚Äôt much splash art,btohqsg
But her left leg was fked,btohqsg
that truck driver just wrong place at wrong time,btohqsg
Based on timeline  I drove past like maybe 5 to 10 mins past the incident,btohqsg
And there was blood but not like splashy or messy,btohqsg
computer science is the worstim taking a course thats similar to that and it's so ew,btohqsg
the closest dead body i seen in real life to a human was a cat that jumped off my hdb's corridor,btohqsg
but on the internet...on the otherhand,btohqsg
been to one in my life,btohqsg
did not even see the body,btohqsg
so it was just a casket without a body,btohqsg
I feel like living ppl are more,btohqsg
that fking roblox playing cunt that stopped the PSDs from closing completely which caused the whole system to malfunction at JUR EB?,btohqsg
you saw the ISD post abt roblox,btohqsg
it's not anything worth counting anyway,btohqsg
btw it wasn't NSL it was EWL,btohqsg
I‚Äôm okay with seeing dead ppl so,btohqsg
yes Jurong Eastbound platform door 24,btohqsg

echostudy study studydo work do work do worktys tys tys,btohqsg

WHO DID THAT TO MAH CITARO >:(,btohqsg
Idk if it‚Äôs sad or not,btohqsg

my time  tys is thirty years series,btohqsg
that aint even the worse citaro incident,btohqsg
WHOI IM ON AN SBST NOW TTS CITARO PLS DON'T SCARE ME,btohqsg
Sleep at Lim Chu Kang  lessgo!,btohqsg
I have yet to find the worst bus accident in sg...,btohqsg
with June and Nov  it's like 40 papers,btohqsg
maybe this incident comes close...likely bus scrapped after this alr,btohqsg
half the engine is gone...no saving this bus for sure,btohqsg
i posted the worst sg truck accident pic in recent sg on here b4 i think,btohqsg
you cant even comprehend wtf hit this truck,btohqsg
that is how bad this was...,btohqsg
wtf how are you finding these,btohqsg
i was supposed to send a sticker,btohqsg
btw if yall still guessing  answer is another dump truck,btohqsg
this truck was rear ended by a speeding dumptruck,btohqsg
My every reaction when rejecting someone,btohqsg
What hurts more then no? Ew,btohqsg
this is the result of drink driving folks,btohqsg
the pictures of vehicles getting destroyed,btohqsg
I laugh at kids when that hurt themselves,btohqsg
lmao..ive seen so much car accidents,btohqsg
im like how did that even happen,btohqsg
i think im desensitised to it,btohqsg
that is pretty easy...once you see the positioning of the vehicles,btohqsg
Red honda headon with the bus,btohqsg
I laugh at those that go poly and think ‚Äúoh poly is gonna be fun‚Äù,btohqsg
why was it on the grass anyway,btohqsg
who was driving on pedestrian walkway,btohqsg
when you have a headon...the lighter vehicle will get flung into the air,btohqsg
the vehicle got flung into the position it landed,btohqsg
ive seen so many car accidents  i can likely tell you the difference in crashes between a drunk driving and reckless driving crash,btohqsg
btw since it happened near your schooldid anyone from your school die from that,btohqsg
nah..its a driver vs driver situation,btohqsg
Temperatures hit a record high of 37 deg C in Ang Mo Mio today  the highest in 40 years. Temperatures also breached the 36 deg C mark in several parts of the island.https://str.sg/iJJ5,btohqsg
and did it turn out to be true,btohqsg
I got a lot of things to say,btohqsg
i 1 month into rp and i want to drop out already,btohqsg
One of which is that they didn‚Äôt teach us to be independent but more of its enforced to us students,btohqsg
for context: hardwork is not rewarded in RP,btohqsg
Poly teachers will say things like,btohqsg
whu everything must be teamwork bro,btohqsg
Literally do Ntg and get paid,btohqsg
you will still get fucked over by the team,btohqsg
I rmb I scolded the teacher for being useless,btohqsg
imagine telling students to be so reliant on the internet,btohqsg
you know that not everything online is true right,btohqsg
And I said that what‚Äôs the point of paying you to be useless,btohqsg
exactly my teammates so fucking trash for 1 modulesuch slackers i hate poly i want to drop out but i cant bro,btohqsg
Teaching us time independent is one thing forcing us to be independent is another,btohqsg
there was this one time where my lecturer was 15 min late for second period of class and my classmate told her off for being hypocritical,btohqsg
That‚Äôs not how it shld work,btohqsg
its like the poly lecturers telling all of us that if we dont do teamwork our grades will be fucked,btohqsg
and not everybody learns from working with others,btohqsg
But I can say one thing,btohqsg
but in rp literally every single module requires teamwork like wtf,btohqsg
As a ite student that goes to poly,btohqsg
even math class has teamwork. wtf,btohqsg
Poly teachers have no teaching skills,btohqsg
I say it before and I‚Äôll say it again,btohqsg
MY SEC SCH TEACHERS ACTUALLY TEACHES US,btohqsg
A ITE teacher can teach a poly class,btohqsg
yet poly lecturers are paid more than sec sch teachers just because they teach at a tertiary school,btohqsg
A poly teacher can‚Äôt teach a class of ITE students,btohqsg
And I‚Äôm not talking about those rebel kids,btohqsg
I‚Äôm talking about those smart students in ite,btohqsg
Most poly teachers don‚Äôt have the teaching ability,btohqsg
‚Äúdk then just google la‚Äùthen what about during the time when the internet hasnt existed?‚Äúdk then just die la‚Äù is it?,btohqsg
I understand that it‚Äôs about being independent,btohqsg
Teaching us independent and forcing independent on us is diff,btohqsg
but but in rp THEY ASK US TO DISCUSS EVERYTHING WITH OUR TEAMMATE,btohqsg
and some of my teammates are slackers bro,btohqsg
If a teacher is enthusiastic about his/her class,btohqsg
my lecturer for a module decided to just talk about life story for 1h30minthen proceeded to send a message on telegram scolding students for sleeping in her classyou talk about your life who wont want to sleep sia,btohqsg
i come to poly to learn not hear grandmother story bro,btohqsg
just get straight to the point moron,btohqsg
Mine is like tutorial slides but like idl don't consider it as notes because not concise enough to be considered notes.,btohqsg
It's slides that lecturers use to conduct lessons so not everything in slides,btohqsg
fr then they put in no effort whatsoever,btohqsg
The teachers actually took time out of their lives to make notes for us,btohqsg
and worst thing is poly fees much more expensive than sec sch fees,btohqsg
get rid of poly la stupid,btohqsg
dk what kind of learning method we using bro,btohqsg
Chill then go jc la üòÇ,btohqsg
Tho ya the chers not great,btohqsg
then go jc see if better,btohqsg
