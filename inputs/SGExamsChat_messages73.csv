All I heard was some guy here wanted to be admin but like he got salty that he did not so he created SGeducators to spite,btohqsg
kind of the entire story alr tbh,btohqsg
it's quite childish  if you ask me,btohqsg
I mean it‚Äôs good you do it on your own,btohqsg
But making SGexams a banned word or asking why you are randomly added that makes you temp banned is childish,btohqsg

whats up guys its medic baghow many layers of irony there,btohqsg
im high on fucking panadol so idk,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking here to clarify doubts,btohqsg
sgeducators was created apparently because admin tried to take over another tutor telegram group,btohqsg
I heard it from this person,btohqsg
I was told by someone who I shall not dox and cause this someone is in this group,btohqsg
then tried to take over sgexams next,btohqsg
Imma observe from a safe distance,btohqsg
the magic word is unverified information,btohqsg
Bruh u alr going to hell for numerous sins,btohqsg
Might as well create a heaven on earth,btohqsg

Going to a small class and no one around in school,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs like your teacher calling your class back  not planned for the whole cohort by the school  which isn‚Äôt rare,btohqsg
My class has never been called back before,btohqsg
Small classes + school isn‚Äôt crowded,btohqsg
Not called back during holidays or anything,btohqsg

According to my experience  yours is the anomaly,btohqsg

suicide : the zeitgeist of the zoomin‚Äô 20s,btohqsg
It's not fun entertaining such thoughts,btohqsg
My eyes roll damn far back behind my head when my dad said that,btohqsg

i for one want to die being rammed by a car after running into the road trying to hail down a car that i mistakenly thought was being driven by my lover but was actually not due to a spontaneous decision to change cars,btohqsg
Why not just get gunned down while swimming in your pool,btohqsg
i for one look down on people with depressions too,btohqsg
Fun fact: if you say ‚ÄúI want to kill myself‚Äù on ur insta story (using text) Instagram will prompt you to get help,btohqsg

If the government knows that you are mentally ill  employers are legally required to basically interrogate you about it and wether you can work effectively (because you aren‚Äôt expected to anymore). Sadly  it creates a systemic discrimination against such people and you will be more likely to loose ur job,btohqsg

There's a world record for running in heel,btohqsg

And he will always have some dull ache in the back,btohqsg
So you dont get to height shame me,btohqsg

One can dream of being an epic boss lady,btohqsg
But the responsibilities you carry becomes heavier now,btohqsg
And the more responsibilities u need to shoulder what a great trade off,btohqsg
And the impending doom of old age,btohqsg

The people are sheep and the officials are shepherds,btohqsg
But you're falling right into that trap,btohqsg
You can have your own rules that coincide with the rules of the country you live it,btohqsg
However these rules were implanted in you from young,btohqsg
You can never claim them to be your rules,btohqsg
Can i shepherd u off the cliff,btohqsg
I follow myself  if it happens to be on the same path as the common one  There‚Äôs nothing wrong with that,btohqsg
dont u think ure thinking too ideally of the real life situations lol,btohqsg
Or maybe you‚Äôve deceived yourself into thinking that the common path you follow is a path you‚Äôve chosen yourself,btohqsg
Are we not an amalgamation of the rules that have been engraved into ya since young anyways?,btohqsg
Actually chinese studies can do other things that isn't education,btohqsg
Bound to the indoctrination of society,btohqsg
You can only truly be free after accepting such truth,btohqsg
Or would you just be unhappy,btohqsg

In fact  you're going to be restricted to a certain actions,btohqsg
Are you serious or are you memeing,btohqsg
i think he meant silver serpent,btohqsg
Then tuition centres and stuff I guess,btohqsg
Natural behavior is a social construct  but without it we will descend into chaos,btohqsg
Im pretty much limiting my career choices anyw,btohqsg
Chaos is the natural state of things,btohqsg
Ugh I can FEEL the wrinkles in my soul,btohqsg

Girl school uniforms are easily fetishised,btohqsg
