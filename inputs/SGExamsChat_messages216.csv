Anyone has any experience with android studio?,btohqsg
No at least he is doing something he is passionate for!,btohqsg
"I still prefer ""Thank You  Next"" album.",btohqsg
So late. Can't wait to see my tutee achievements. 😂,btohqsg
tho positions songs all about the same,btohqsg
thank u next has good songs and shit songs,btohqsg
funny how i asked that at 2am,btohqsg
"I do applaud Ariana Grande for the bold production choices as it shows her versatility but from a cohesive narrative standpoint  ""Thank you  Next"" is much thought out.",btohqsg
Sian. Results day range from 17 - 21. They decide to put it on 17,btohqsg
though i didnt listen to all the songs there,btohqsg
"That was great as well but I much prefer ""Thank you  Next.""",btohqsg
I am still disappointed by the GRAMMYs snubbing The Weeknd.,btohqsg
my favourite from tyn is bloodline,btohqsg
"No  like he did not get nominated for any awards despite ""After Hours"" being one of the best albums for the year and ""Blinding Lights"" being a hit single of the year.",btohqsg
Yeah  I like the song but it feels weird in the context of the album imho.,btohqsg
Anyone waiting for Kid Cudi's Man on The Moon 3?,btohqsg
dont @ me but i feel blinding lights isnt that great,btohqsg
it was nice after that it isnt,btohqsg
I agree with you to an extent as the album did not spawn another hit single besides that song.,btohqsg
It makes much more sense in the context of the album as the song isn't that light hearted if you listen to the song which precedes it in the album.,btohqsg
Overplayed songs tend to get annoying,btohqsg
But no matter how many times blinding lights gets overplayed it's still better than bad guy,btohqsg
I wouldn't directly say that since they are of different genres and a comparison of such magnitude would be unfair.,btohqsg
But no matter how much autotune u have in ur song u still have to sinG,btohqsg
I think Lil Wayne has something to say about that.,btohqsg
"It's unfortunate how that album is only recognised for ""Bad Guy"".",btohqsg
I listen most of her songs from 2015 onwards,btohqsg
But i stopped somewhere in 2019,btohqsg
I think that was the unfortunate moment where her songs went downhill,btohqsg
tbh that whole album isnt my type of thing so i skip it,btohqsg
the press release for O’s aren’t out yet,btohqsg
tbh its the first song that stood out to me frm the album,btohqsg
aft it trended on tiktok idrl it as much,btohqsg
oooh right cuz of the dance,btohqsg
so i just vibe with the song,btohqsg
Hi   about the N-lvl result right,btohqsg
Your profile picture is me now,btohqsg
Hope my sayang can score all As,btohqsg
Can tutor me if I retake,btohqsg
Messed up my math and science,btohqsg
Ngl I’m dang worried about my science,btohqsg
Focused too much on my other subjects,btohqsg
Oh I thought A levels lmoa,btohqsg
Hopefully can get A2 for science and B3 for literature,btohqsg
I am not very sure abt the syb for combined sci,btohqsg
I didn't even know such a thing existed...,btohqsg
Imagine what would H3 GP or H3 PW would be like,btohqsg
H3 PW would probably be organising some event for the government or some major corporation,btohqsg
H3 GP might be UN debates,btohqsg
U haven't taken A levels yet...,btohqsg
I know what PW and GP are..,btohqsg
Is retaking gonna look really ugly on a portfolio though,btohqsg
Like in competitive admissions and applications,btohqsg
Next time u might be really good in something. Discover it,btohqsg
If its an interview  they may ask why u retook,btohqsg
Is ‘my teacher abandoned my class’ a valid reason,btohqsg
Because in full honesty that actually happened to my class this year,btohqsg
"What do u mean by ""abandon""?",btohqsg
Teacher blue ticked all of us during study break  refused any consultations unless if we were willing to pay for her lunch or provide her with other benefits (you get the idea). Didn’t even wish us good luck and refused to contribute to our EAE and DSA portfolios,btohqsg
Self study isn’t so easy... especially for humanities,btohqsg
I’m not making this stuff up,btohqsg
And the teacher’s leaving the school too,btohqsg
If its only one week before,btohqsg
It can't really affect too much,btohqsg
Plus takes off her shoes in class  admits to not planning out her lessons  swears in front of us during class. Then cries when one of my juniors called her unprofessional on the school confessions page,btohqsg
Seems more legit than the stuff someone was spewing last weekend,btohqsg
Shd have reported it to the VP or Principal then,btohqsg
Didn’t even bother planning out lessons during lockdown,btohqsg
So what she has her socks on only?,btohqsg
‘Didn’t want to learn howto use Google meets),btohqsg
Then puts her feet on her chair,btohqsg
Agree that she exhibits symptoms of mental illness,btohqsg
Just think Wat u wanna do in future bah,btohqsg
I still have my sec 3 mock papers with my chemistry teacher,btohqsg
I demanded and all i got was okok yes i will give it to you soon,btohqsg

I told them I wanted computer science/meds,btohqsg
Any asian parent would be satisfied and damn happy to hear that,btohqsg
Cuz my brothers are in either meds / com sci alr,btohqsg
Then what they want to you to do,btohqsg
i now hv to convince my parents to let me go for a course i want,btohqsg
I wanted sign on if I can't get either of those two,btohqsg

poly full price is 10k a year,btohqsg
iw tourism but my parents say its q limited job opportunities compared to like accountancy or wtv,btohqsg
idek why u want go poly after uni,btohqsg
but if u have degree u can't have subsidy liao,btohqsg
wait but if i dae next year and get in,btohqsg

and why do u want to study psych anyway,btohqsg
jcs wise maybe asrjc or sajc,btohqsg
np merged psych with another course and the new course is 9 points,btohqsg
If it’s interesting and you desire pursuing a career in it why not just go for it after Os,btohqsg
And if it’s not  then just do an online course on psychology,btohqsg
No point going to poly after a degree,btohqsg

hi anyone know how do split,btohqsg
got that leg split thingy lor,btohqsg
Last time my male school friend  fell and did a split he tore his shorts. And it happened he did not wear his underwear that day.,btohqsg
I can do the side splits. Centre splits still working on it. Started training for it during my time in school. I took up dance in primary and secondary school. I would say rather than how to do  it would be consistent stretching and practice to progress closer to perfect splits.,btohqsg
There is lots of tutorials available on youtube to master splits.,btohqsg

Unless u want to screw yourself,btohqsg
I am filled with good ideas,btohqsg
only the ones taking the n level results are allowed to enter,btohqsg
Our history dates back to November 2017  where we started off on Reddit as r/SGExams. 💭A simple Reddit page grew to become a student-based volunteering group when a team of moderators came together to organise our first ever offline activity in collaboration with Youth Corps Singapore - a beach cleanup. 🧹 The event was quickly oversubscribed and turned out to be a huge success. 🥇 Amazed by the impact created  the team was inspired and realised that they could do much more good within the student community. So  they did. 👍Read more about our past  our present and our future right here at SGExams.

this was planned from the start wasn't it,btohqsg
But I can go to DPP or Sec 5,btohqsg
Since my English is 3   the rest is 1 . Art is 4 ( strict marker ),btohqsg
so where u planning to go,btohqsg
But what am I going to learn in Sec 5 ?,btohqsg
And he dominate the god of iq,btohqsg
English   E math  C.science( Chem   Physics )   Humanities ( Ss  His ) art,btohqsg
If you know what course you want to pursue  go with DPP  if the Poly course can later lead to a degree. There's about 20 to 30% extra content to learn from Sec 4 to 5. Since you scored 1 for most subjects  you would not have problems coping well... but no point doing Sec 5  if you are already sure of the course you want in Poly. If you are targeting some unique professions such as Medicine  Law  Dentistry  Pharmacy - the O-level to JC route is preferred  but you must have the confidence to work hard at your studies to continue to excel and keep up with your peers.,btohqsg
Hey guys I got one qns if someone get grd 4 for english and all others grd 1 can they appeal for pfp? Asking on my cousin's behalf not sure if the system has changed (I heard of stories that can be done but not sure if it's true),btohqsg
