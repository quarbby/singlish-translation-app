Q2 to q3 like not so fantastic,btohqsg
It trades at 813m sgd market cap.They have stated 4Q as a record quarter. So conservatively speaking 3Q is 45m so if 4Q is the same we look at full year of 129m usd or 175m sgdSo based on this figure it trades at a Pe of 4.6And an underestimate of 4Q results. Could be looking PE 3-4,btohqsg
