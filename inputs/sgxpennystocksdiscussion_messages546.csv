Vividthree($0.049/$0.050)- Today closed long legged Doji close to the main downtrend resistance line (11 months duration)- MACD cross and turned up and sudden decent volume relative to this counter.The Game starts when they decide to push past $0.050. Evidently  there were buyers today and if they decide to maintain close to this price range  it might be soon. Just watch for that elusive $0.050 which is just one step away.🙏🏻 hard since I have held this for some time. DYODD and wish us all luck.,btohqsg

The slide dye to outage was only in the last couple of hours...main blow today was the whistle blower incidentExpect that there will be a prolonged dip before recovery and long term damage to advertiser trust,btohqsg
Tech / Facebook :: Facebook servers are out but European investigation is the longer term risk,btohqsg
Facebook / IG / Whatsapp outage appears to be at the DNS level i.e the system resolving website domain names to IP addresses. This is  from a technical standpoint an uncomplicated cause of outage despite the massive impact at global scale,btohqsg
While long term investors may be tempted to buy the glitch  a more pertinent issue announced 2 hours ago may prove to be the bigger issue facing facebook,btohqsg

✈️Pika World Update- 5 October 2021✈️🔩Sectors Highlights: Industrials and MaterialsAs bond yield surge  it is common to see sectors such as industrials and materials closely linked to the economy do well. However  they have been lacklustre due to the usual reasons such as supply chain disruption and earnings estimates.As analysts drop their earnings estimates due to intense supply constraints  these companies need to source their parts globally and given that they can't get access to these necessary supplies  they cannot meet their goals.Companies like 3M are also facing profit margin pressure given that the increase in the selling process cannot make up for the rise in cost pressure.Pika World sees the sector as continuing to face headwinds.🚘Tesla: Yes to Solid Delivery FigureThe EV pioneer broke yet another record as it delivered more cars than expected. As a result  analysts are now boosting their earnings estimates  given their robust delivery figure. More than 241 000 vehicles were delivered in 3rd quarterThe result is incredible given a backdrop of semiconductor shortage that constrains its rivals such as General Motors and other traditional legacy companies. Nevertheless  Pika World continues to have exposure on the EV giant  and our eyes are now set on Thursday Annual General Meeting.⛽️Evergrande: Shares Halt Pending Corporate ActionThe shares of China Evergrande halted as it is reported that Hopson  which is a rival  is planning to purchase a portion of Evergrande property-services unit for around $5 billion. However  Pika World does not see this as a game-changer to solve its deep debt of $300 billion.The company also plans to sell its $1.5 billion stakes in Shengjing Bank to an SOE asset management company as it seeks to raise massive cash. More importantly  it is reported to make a $260 million payment on a dollar note on Monday. However  unlike other bond payments  this repayment does not have the luxury of 30-day grace. Essentially  the default happens if the sum is not paid within a 5-day grace period.Pika World continues to see ongoing drama surrounding Evergrande. Still  it may be comforted that the Chinese company or its SOE will come in to limit the damage of the fallout and default risk spilling over to other sectors of the economy.📮What's on the Menu Today?At 10 pm  we will receive the ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI  which we expect modest moderation to 60.0 from 61.7 in the prior period.11 pm will see ECB President Lagarde Speaks  and 1.15 am will welcome FOMC Quarles as he speaks  and investors will be eyeing the usual insights of their perspective on the current economic climate.It is 5 October  Tuesday  at 7.30 am in Singapore and 7.30 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a splendid and profitable week ahead!,btohqsg

https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/us2t-in-investments-needed-over-next-decade-to-green-south-east-asiasMain Extract:SOME US$2 trillion (S$2.7 trillion) in sustainable infrastructure investment is needed between 2021 and 2030 if South-east Asia is to achieve climate and sustainable development goals  according to a report produced by Bain & Co  Microsoft  and Temasek.These funds are needed for investments into infrastructure for renewable energy  energy-efficient buildings  greener transportation  the treatment of water and wastewater  rail networks  and the processing of waste.Anyways  did some study and found 1 counter that should benefit quite significantly from this infrastructure Investment.*ANNAIK ($0.072/$0.073)* - FOR INVESTMENT ONLY AS OF NOWFurthermore- their recent numbers looks good- Did a series of share buybacks recently in the past 1.5 months at as high as high as $0.078?- NAV $0.21- There was a recent pump up to 9 series which should be some accumulation by the players.Can keep this one closely. Put in watchlist. I believe this one will be an easy half or even double bag when in play. But DYODD  as it still rather illiquid although can tell that the volume is slowly streaming in.,btohqsg
TM pressed down too long... time to rebound,btohqsg

AnnAik closed well today.Called out 72/73 and closed 782 rounds of accumulation already by the players.MACD will cross up. Getting more interesting. I for-see more players will get interested and begin to take notice and trade this one once they go above 8 series.Meantime  watchlist this one. Heavily undervalued counter and good theme for play. Good to note that company has been doing plenty of share buy backs in past 1.5 months (highest $0.078 - psychological safety net here)DYODD. To me  this investment is sure win as long as can hold at these prices.,btohqsg
about time to breakout the big triangle  earnings improving too,btohqsg

🚀Pika World Update- 6 October 2021🚀🤼The Mysterious PerformanceIt isn't intuitive that tech stocks rose sharply even as the yield was also rising in the session. However  while the 10-year Treasury yield hit 1.53%  Nasdaq had a remarkable comeback and climbed 1.6%. This dynamic is interesting as we would have expected the index to tumble.It needs not to be ironic. First  tech stocks price tend to reflect the market expectation on the bond market. We see buyers scooping up shares after Monday's fall hit a level somewhat similar to the July sell-off when the index hit a bottom of 14 274.Second  such buying behaviour is also linked to investors expectations for the yield ahead. As of now  investors contend that the recent spike in bond yield may stabilise  and we could see the yield ranges around 1.46% to 1.54%. However  convincingly  a break above this level may bring us back to the 2021 high at 1.75%.Pika World continues to monitor the yield movement as we solidify our gains for the year.🚘EV Sector: Lordstown MotorsLordstown Motors seems to be struggling lately and further crashed after it was downgraded to sell by Morgan Stanley from $8 to $2  which was a big hit. In addition  the planned sales of its Ohio manufacturing facility for $230 million in cash is way less than the 20% value of the plant.The sale is primarily attributed to raising cash to introduce EV truck- Endurance into the market. Limited production is on the move in late 2021. However  the cash balance has been burning  and investors are concerned about the need to raise funds as it scales up production.Pika World remains cautious about the company as it had cut guidance before for its 2021 vehicle production.🎙Facebook: Under Stress but Still a BuySeveral damaging reports from WSJ had dampened investors' appetite for its stocks. In addition  there have been concerns about its advertising businesses  significantly worsen in a choppy trading environment for technology stocks as inflation pushes interest rate expectation to rise.For one  the social impact of Facebook on users is under critical scrutiny as people turn attention to the merits and weaknesses of social media. While the stock continues to outperform in the long term  there is growing concern about how negative headlines weigh its prospect.As a whole  investors seem to place limited risk to its current business model  in particular to its advertising challenges and privacy crisis with Apple's change in their iOS. Pika World has not initiated any position in the stock  but Facebook does have a record of surprising negative sentiments with robust performance.📮What's on the Menu Today?At 8.15 pm  we will have the ADP Non-Farm Payroll  which we expect to rise from 374K to 428K.10.30 pm brings us to Crude Oil Inventories which we expect a further drawdown of 0.300M.We will welcome FOMC Member Bostic to speak at 11.30 pm  which will be yet another possible insight on the economic health prospect in the US.It is 6 October  Tuesday  at 7.52 am in Singapore and 7.52 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a mooNATic week ahead!,btohqsg
