no feel for tengah though it is like paya lebar of the west looking on the map,btohqsg
yeah I like it too but too bad I am moving out soon later this year,btohqsg
design of punggol estates are unique and nice though,btohqsg
haha hope gahmen is not planning to demolish the hawker,btohqsg
u will be given the range of flats to choose  then the price will be beside the unit,btohqsg
make sure that your queue number is within the 3x range of the number of units. if not u can ballot for the next project,btohqsg
why prepare $2 000 bro 😂😂,btohqsg
choose rooms need to pay $2 000? i didnt pay that,btohqsg
Selection need to pay deposits of maximum 2000,btohqsg
ohhhh ya  i chose my flat back in 2016  very long ago. LOL,btohqsg
Choosing your unit means you have to pay an 'Option Fee' ranging from 2 room - $500 till 4/5 room - $2000. Of which can be refunded by your CPF later or you can just add that to the downpayment portion and offset,btohqsg
when will it be refundable ar? at key collection day?,btohqsg
too long ago for me liao 😂😂,btohqsg
your address is there if you dont mind,btohqsg
We can go and knock on your door now HAHAHA,btohqsg

Actually now with decentralisation and plenty of neighbourhood shopping options and amenities  plus going forward focus on WFH and remote working  location location location still key? Food for thought... I for one wouldn't mind Woodlands (when few years ago wouldn't even consider it) esp with the rejuvenation and Grade A offices even locating there. I hope it will still be affordable when my turn comes.,btohqsg
"A very deep message. Can I try?""di gor liang di gor zor""?",btohqsg
(wherever it is shady and nice  i will go nest),btohqsg
Punting on it to be the next hot stuff,btohqsg
Hidden gem  now start to surface,btohqsg
We had the East (Punggol Jewel etc)  West (Tengah  2nd link)  South (GSW) and now it's the turn for the North.HUATTTT ARRRRR,btohqsg
no matter how different the location becomes,btohqsg
Yes  even if location as in which town in SG is same same due to remote working  decentralisation  suburban malls and Grab delivery  our location specifically as in which block  which facing  which floor and which direction still will matter.,btohqsg
Does anyone have any idea when a non-mature town will be classified as mature?Kinda hard to imagine that Woodlands is still a non-mature estate with all the amenities and population,btohqsg
6 months before the launch  see what HDB classified it as,btohqsg
I mean any insight on how HDB classify a town between mature and non-mature?,btohqsg
Think the resale price will rise once it’s been classified as a mature town and just wondering when will it be 😅,btohqsg

If one of us is at the age of 30 itself  still can go for 5%?,btohqsg
Hello any group for parc wood tengah proj?,btohqsg
As long one below 30 can le,btohqsg
the question is  what if the younger party is 30 zhun zhun?,btohqsg
OK so which means zhunzhun 30yo is acceptable for staggered payment,btohqsg
Yeah I read about this too. Anytime before we hit our 31st birthday will be eligible right? For example  if my 31st bday is in June 2021  then we can apply for staggered before my birthday?,btohqsg
that's provided the 2nd appointment is before your 31st bd,btohqsg
Submission of application can le. No need second appt,btohqsg
2nd appt refers to signing of lease aka payment for the 5%/10%,btohqsg
not sure is it based on the date you ballot upon the launch or upon the date you sign the lease,btohqsg
Flat application is submitted on or before the younger applicant’s 30th birthday 🤔,btohqsg
That mean if the younger applicant cross the 30th birthday then NOT eligible for the Staggered Downpayment scheme.Layman term  if pass the 30th birthday then cannot go for the scheme.😀,btohqsg
Okie got it. so they look at time of flat submission and not 2nd appointment right?,btohqsg
my case  from the day I ballot to my 2nd appointment was a span of 10 months,btohqsg
my wife was 30 when we went for the 2nd appt,btohqsg

Ivan  the bracket dates are the actual TOP dates before the covid HAHA,btohqsg
Sorry..  I abit long winded. I  called HDB asking about the key collection.  The official told me   they go by completed block. How true? Have anyone heard or have friends moved in while some other blocks still under going ..... .,btohqsg
Yes. By completion of block and surrounding too. As they also don't want to impose danger to moving in resident too.,btohqsg
completion of block and surrounding means?,btohqsg
The entire block is completed. Accessible to your house is safe.,btohqsg
means the whole project is completed?,btohqsg
Completed block to ensure public safety regulations. This to ensure any public that visiting the block are under safe conditions not under construction conditions. The touch up work will be still on going until the actual TOP,btohqsg
Thank you all for the information.,btohqsg
Is there any chance will it be earlier?,btohqsg
Do noted multistorey carpark must be completed first before issuing key for the completed block.I had encounter that they distribute key for the completed block while some other are still not completed for my last BTO applicatijn at sengkang.,btohqsg

Nop noone know what are the projects till hdb release the details,btohqsg
Also selection are still ongoing so hdb will not release for sbf yet,btohqsg
Saw one block building level 2 already. 😄,btohqsg
Hi can I know how to cancel my hle?,btohqsg
U have to wait for ur hle to expire,btohqsg

I been finding but I can't find,btohqsg
U can just count 6 mths from date of application,btohqsg
12 Aug 2020 so last month is the expiry but I still could not apply,btohqsg
Hihi  I previously called hdb about this before. They say you can write in to cancel,btohqsg
Hi  can i ask if i want to apply for a bto during april  will i be able to bid again for may?,btohqsg
So I just write under feedback?,btohqsg
Although my is expired I still need to write in right?,btohqsg
Yup. There is a part that says for HLE you write in to via this link,btohqsg
Hmm if expired already you should be able to reapply. But since you couldn't  maybe you can write in to clarify!,btohqsg
Can let them know the system not letting you reapply even though expire already,btohqsg
Oh is it? I saw somewhere that there was a launch for queensway area during april. Is that not bto?,btohqsg
At the hdb page you scroll all the way down and you will see 'Contact Us',btohqsg
Inside have option to select that you asking about HLE,btohqsg
Hi guys  I’m kinda new here. I would like to ask there’s gonna be like open booking end of the month. Are the BTO like build halfway or does it still take like 5 years ish?,btohqsg
Hello  on the website for open booking  u can see when the flat will be estimated completed.,btohqsg
Has anyone done something like this and care to share the reason why?Bought a new BTO flat as a first-timer and sold it offBought a 2nd BTO flat as a second-timerReasons may be such as... don't see the need for facilities  cash proceeds preservation  cheaper unit... etc etc.If anyone willing to share  that would be great.,btohqsg
Hi! Does anyone know if the HLE can be approved by 1 week?Possible?,btohqsg
Ohh great  thanks for the info! Hopefully I’ll get it within days. Wanna go for open booking 🤞🏼,btohqsg
you know where is my place?,btohqsg
I called in to check if they can expedite before  got it in 5 working days 👍🏻,btohqsg
Think once documents are ready will be fast😄,btohqsg
Thanks for the tip! Will call them today :),btohqsg
Btw have anyone tried open booking before or heard how it works? :),btohqsg
so if you apply faster u get a better number,btohqsg
i applied like12 mins aft the slot opened,btohqsg
and i got like some ridiculous number,btohqsg
there were only lik 3 units left when it was my turn,btohqsg
wah thanks. punggol top spot  I also want to move back there when I retired,btohqsg
Oh no.. that’s a very fierce competition hahaha,btohqsg
We don’t need singpass when applying am I right?,btohqsg
do we choose the area we want during the application as well?,btohqsg
I think what I understood so far actually Punggol Sengkang same when it comes to resale price .Even Punggol and Sengkang resale price is same like Sembawang now.,btohqsg
Also it’s coz Punggol and Sengkang have more flats to offer for resale in comparison of other estates so people have more options to buy there and I think later tengah will have same resale median,btohqsg
Hi... anyone knows when the sale of balance flats will be launched?,btohqsg
Can check HDB esale website to check the transaction price  dont need to guess.,btohqsg
Punggol central 4 room fetch $423k only base in HDB record.😀,btohqsg
Yes sale price depend on location  which floor and how many lease years remaining.,btohqsg
my mum's 4r in punggol 2nd and 3rd storey worth 370k,btohqsg
Do u guys know Normally when Hdb started to access our grant most probably the result will be out very soon,btohqsg
Hey. Wondering if anyone know when hdb will inform you when you can collect your bto key? Will it be few mths or few weeks before key collection?,btohqsg
I was told 2 months before key collection so that we have enough time to re evaluate our housing loan when I signed lease if I didn’t remember wrongly 🤔,btohqsg
3 mths b4 key collection u need submit hle,btohqsg
Yes correct it depends on which room model are fetching 500k coz normal 4Rm is the same everywhere unless best view or high floor,btohqsg
Not accurate. Just an automatic formula tracker based timeline.,btohqsg
Shoutout to any BTO Waterway Sunrise Residents. If you are a resident of these estates  do reach out to me and I will send you the link. NO property agents  NO advertisers  NO sellers  NO money lenders please. Thank you! ❤️❤️,btohqsg
Yes bto tracker are not accurate.Best to monitor the progress by site visit.😀,btohqsg
Take is as a gauge for checking the TOP  its around that period  just that different blocks have different dates  so everyone might be in different block  so some might see 100% already but haven't get keys for example.,btohqsg
Can I ask  so if we do week book the unit we want on 24 Mar itself or just book a number?,btohqsg
Then if get good number can choose the unit the next day?,btohqsg
Anyone got any idea of current Q number for sbf tamp 5 room?,btohqsg

Book flat need ROM cert already?,btohqsg
Based on my experience  we did shown the staff our cert,btohqsg
Since we were already married before the bto launch,btohqsg
For us we gave a photocopy of our marriage cert to the HDB Officer🙂,btohqsg
Yup but it's not a requirement to be married,btohqsg
Yup as we were married also during our flat selection,btohqsg
Now think of it  submitting of ROM cert during 1st two appointments also redundant if they need us to submit again upon key collection,btohqsg
Not relevant to me since we got married before the launch,btohqsg
What's the bto next to jurong point?,btohqsg

95% of open booking flats sold.⚠️ No more Chinese quota.🔎 Please monitor the flats and ethnic quota availability athttps://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/finding-a-flat?modeOfSale=Open%20bookingbefore coming for your appointmentAs of 1st April 2021 (for 24th March 2021 launch)• 1xUpp Cross St- 3-room (60sqm $378 700  56 years left  M/IO)• 3xClementi NorthArc- 3Gen (120sqm $559 100  U/C 4Q2022  M/IO)• 1xMei Ling Street- Executive (150sqm $758 500  73 years left  M/IO)📆 Estimated next launch of OBF around September 2021,btohqsg
Now then I know what is external landscape,btohqsg
may i please check if anyone here missed the appointment date before and appealed? tried to reschedule cannot already. asked to write in to officer. success of appeal high? thanks for advice 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Desired unit might have chosen by others already,btohqsg
appointment missed was to sign SPA,btohqsg
This one missed is actually good news lol,btohqsg
Defer the compute of accrued interest,btohqsg
Look for MP if HDB no reply you,btohqsg
haha. the letter of appointment says that if missed  means unit will be cancelled.will call HDB monday. and try write in,btohqsg
You should do it tmr morning,btohqsg
Anyway LOA means lease of agreement,btohqsg
Aka 2nd appointment  making 5%/10% payment,btohqsg
So at this point if you don't want your unit  you only have the option fee forfeited,btohqsg
If you missed it hdb take it as u give up so ur option fees will be gone n u have to bto again.,btohqsg
To be honest with you even if u try appeal chances are slim,btohqsg
Weird  thought HDB will call you up if you missed your appointment on that day,btohqsg
I never went for unit selection  they called me up,btohqsg
Nop no show mean u give up,btohqsg
OK lor though they did called me on selection day,btohqsg
yeah no call  emails or follow up. but my mistake for overlooking.,btohqsg
But no offence don't put tat much hope cos hdb will have send email to u 2 to 3 wks b4 ur appointment.,btohqsg
no worries. we know it’s our mistake too. just checking here if anyone had faced similar a case,btohqsg

thks!If we are unable sell the existing HDB within 6 months of getting the 2nd new HDB will we be charged the ABSD?How much will be the ABSD  if any?,btohqsg
Absd means buy private property liao is it,btohqsg
I mean absd always relate to private property isn't it,btohqsg
How Do You Calculate ABSD?For instance  say if a property is valued at $1 million but the selling price is $1.1 million. Assuming that you're subjected to 12% ABSD  the ABSD amount that you'll need to pay is $1.1 million X 12% = $132 000.Who Needs to Pay ABSD?ABSD applies to the following group of buyers:Singapore Citizens: ABSD will be levied on the second (12%) and subsequent property purchasesSingapore Permanent Residents (PRs): ABSD will be levied on all purchases. The first purchase will be 5% while second and subsequent purchases will be 15%Foreigners: 20% ABSD for any property purchaseEntities (companies or associations): 25% for each property,btohqsg

HDB will only release units after all ppl with a queue no for the bto selected a unit.for example Feb 2021 bto will not be released for May 2021 as selections are still ongoing.Leftover flats will go to sale balance flat.if there are leftover of sales of balance flats it will go to open booking(including those unit given up),btohqsg
Then again  it's never 'cannot sell'  more like 'cannot meet your desired price'.,btohqsg
If you lelong it I'm sure there will be a long Q to buy.,btohqsg
I'm not joking or being sarcastic because my parents will be in this situation very soon  i.e. take over new HDB and need to sell the existing HDB.,btohqsg
By right any HDB can sell one  unless it is in this kind of state when being marketed:https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/my-mother-doesnt-think-she-has-a-problem-the-challenges-faced-by-those-helping-people-who,btohqsg

Hi  just wondering is there a chat group for urbanville@woodlands house owners?,btohqsg
Anyone here knows if there's a group chat for woodlands glade owners?,btohqsg
Why so many of you keep on asking such question,btohqsg
Does anyone knows what's the current application status of alkaff breeze,btohqsg
I think no one has been informed of their appt date,btohqsg
"I've tried to search and no avail  I thought it may be because the name of the group might be different to ""Woodlands Glade"" that's why I couldn't find it. You get what I mean?",btohqsg
Maybe because the owner has set it to private mode  means only inviting,btohqsg
That's why we can't find it,btohqsg
Ahhhhh that's really sad. Thought the owner could see my texts but alas. Thats okay though 😂,btohqsg
How to search for the owner?,btohqsg
I mean how did you know is which one,btohqsg
I don't! Trying my luck asking this question I case owner is in here,btohqsg
Hahahahahahaha so I apologise for my dumb questions at times,btohqsg
Wah the Facebook page for Woodlands Glade is full of designers promotions 😂,btohqsg
This Sengkang BTO made more profit than The Pinnacle @ Duxton -99.cohttps://www.99.co/singapore/insider/bto-project-the-pinnacle-duxton/,btohqsg
I actually live diagonal opposite from this aspella bto,btohqsg
Can yours be sold as high as 600k for 4r?,btohqsg
I live aspella and has sold the unit in 2019,btohqsg
Don't understand why the profit margin so huge,btohqsg
Despite its a non mature estate,btohqsg
Hello guys!Anyone can advise on this:I already gotten a unitAlready paid 2k option feeCurrent on hdb loanWaiting for appointment to pay 1st 5% downpaymentThen by right upon collecting key  I’ll pay the other 5% based on staggered downpayment.If i want to change to bank loan  when should I notify hdb ?,btohqsg
Maybe you should just approach the bank and check with them,btohqsg
At the same time comparing the rates,btohqsg
Maybe just check with the hdb officer when signing lease.,btohqsg
That's what I plan to do haha,btohqsg
Afraid it's too late to switch once you have paid the option fee,btohqsg
First-timers typically go for an HDB loan since they require no cash downpayment (see below)  but if you’re savvy and have enough savings  you can opt for a bank loan to get lower interest rates.Either way  you’ll need to get some kind of loan approval in principal BEFORE you chope the flat.,btohqsg
From what I know  most people who intend to get bank loan opt for hdb loan first due to lower downpayment required  and do the switching closer to key collection or even after key collection.,btohqsg
Have to service 6 months of HDB loan first before the switch,btohqsg
Then once you switched  you can't get HDB loan anymore,btohqsg
Is it? Then those who hit hdb loan limit upon the final HLE how,btohqsg
Seriously I don't know about bank loan,btohqsg
Have heard of people mentioning it,btohqsg
OK after reading your question a few times ,btohqsg
You have to come up with cash portion,btohqsg
Ya probably need to pay 5% downpayment by cash when switching to bank loan,btohqsg
Haha I'm at the stage of key collection already,btohqsg
Hmm not really  Regardless BTO or not  which project can siam one?,btohqsg
Yes I understand need to have at least 5% cash downpayment,btohqsg
Tried calling in today but keen cut my line due to nobody answer,btohqsg
Ok i try to call the officer again tomorrow then,btohqsg
Cash down payment is up to 20% right,btohqsg
I chose my unit in year 2017  decided on HDB loan then. My expected key collection is 3Q2021. I informed HDB that I’m going to change to bank loan in March 2021 but maybe can inform earlier so to avoid delay in collecting keys.,btohqsg
Yup over. But probably I should have done it maybe early jan or last year.,btohqsg
The switch causing delay in collecting keys?,btohqsg
Not sure. Some ppl said it will take months to settle a bank loan. Though mine seems to be accepted by bank within a month. But to be safe  maybe can do earlier.,btohqsg
Hi.. just a random question.. Any idea if let's say a divorcee below 35  can apply for bto or resales?,btohqsg
Then you have to pay 5% with cash. Then rest of 20% with cpf and cash. Cos bank only loan you up to 75%. If you do not wanna fork out cash then you can take hdb loan then change to bank loan. This will be call refinancing which total duration will take around 6months and you will be paying hdb loan interest rate for 6months before you refinance. In the long run is worth as banks are doing fixed interest rate at 1.4-1.5% for 5 years compare to HDB loan at 2.5%. By doing refinancing  you don’t have to fork out cash for those who doesn’t want to throw in cash,btohqsg
Oh I paid my 5% in cash when choosing unit so no difference to me if I change now. The remaining can be using Cpf. I’m getting 1.25% based on floating now but probably will change to 5 years fixed 1.4% upon key collection. Free conversion during key collection for the bank loan I took up.,btohqsg
Since you paid cash then just let HDB know you wanna change to bank loan before key collection instead,btohqsg
Yup I’ve informed them early March. But my key collection is 3Q so not sure if change to bank loan will delay key collection due to paper works etc,btohqsg
Haha erm just decided to save the Cpf first rather than having to “incur” interest for few years even before getting house. But good thing I did that then cause converting to bank loan now.,btohqsg
Very wise  not many people are willing to do it this way,btohqsg
Thanks. Lucky bank loan interest still low.,btohqsg
May I know anyone have any update on May SBF -2021 ?,btohqsg
I dont think so got sbf eh,btohqsg
Should have but details only out during launch,btohqsg
How long does it takes to get a flat from pphs?,btohqsg
Tiagong the queue is very jialat,btohqsg
If find mp for help got use ??? 😂,btohqsg
MP might ask you to approach HDB first,btohqsg
If got use ah  those in long queue sure go find MP too,btohqsg
Unless you have a solid reason  strong valid reason,btohqsg
tiagong even if you have cleared the principle amount and the accrued interest of your CPFOA  the interest is still compounding  can anyone share is it true?,btohqsg
means say you opted for 20 years loan but clear it on the 10th year  the AI still running,btohqsg
AI nothing to do with loan right?,btohqsg
CPF is like a bank  the moment you used the OA  it starts to charge you interest,btohqsg
unless you're using cash entirely without touching your CPF just like@fishteeth,btohqsg
like I have used 22k three years ago for my down-payment  and the AI is already $1500,btohqsg
the difference is  the AI is rightfully ours  not gahmen's,btohqsg
I’ll still use Cpf when I get the keys for my house for the remaining 20% that I cannot borrow from bank. Can only borrow 75% from bank.,btohqsg
Wah. Three years interest $1500 for 22k usage?,btohqsg
Ya i mean AI not related to housing loan. Meaning if someone doesn't take loan  but uses CPF to pay for the house  he will still incur AI,btohqsg
haha if you  are still using cash for full payment  you're really jskm,btohqsg
If use $220k  will be $15000 of interest in three years.,btohqsg
At least the AI can be used to pay for next property so still ok,btohqsg
my mum used $128k and her AI is already 55k 14 years later,btohqsg
it is good if your profit from selling the house is $100k after minus all the incurred charges,btohqsg
Quite hard I think. Renovation costs a bomb nowadays,btohqsg
reno for my 3r so far is at $16k incl GST,btohqsg
Ohh. Mines more. But think will stay longer than 5 years,btohqsg
How do u pay back the money u took from cpf?,btohqsg
Means like top up your cpf?,btohqsg
wait sorry  am i reading this correctly?principle 100interest 20U mean this 120 u full cleared?Or u only cleared the 100 principle?,btohqsg
but how does the AI being computed since the amount has already been cleared,btohqsg
full clear then supposed to stop rolling,btohqsg
don't understand this part - Note also that depending on the circumstances of the sale  you (as the seller) may also need to refund option monies. If the sales proceeds (after excluding the equivalent of option monies) is enough to make the full CPF refund  then you don’t need to refund the option monies.,btohqsg
don't think that's right. if full clear they charge u interest based on what sum?,btohqsg
my friend also hasn't received the letter yet,btohqsg
the dates on collecting keys or what,btohqsg
Will BTO completion date delay again? Any news on that?,btohqsg
does any one know if a PR is buying a resale flat as family nuclear with Singaporean  does he have to pay higher stamp duty?,btohqsg
not sure does it applies to resale,btohqsg
the 10k will be deducted from the housing price once converted to citizen,btohqsg
if its a matrimonial home shouldnt have ABSD  not sure for family nucleus.,btohqsg
"""If  as a foreigner or PR  you are married to Singaporean citizen and you don’t own any residential property currently  you don’t have to pay ABSD.""",btohqsg
my colleague  a PR recently has bought a condo with her PR hubby  ABSD 7%  she was lamenting 3% only for locals,btohqsg
I think that's BSD not ABSD? ABSD should be at least 12%,btohqsg
but these two BSD apply to HDB too?,btohqsg
BSD is stamp duty paid during lease signing,btohqsg
Hi anyone can tell me roughly how much $$ to prepare for the first appointment ? 3room sbf flat. I believe will be selecting unit ?,btohqsg
will be returned to you after your 2nd appointment,btohqsg
Don’t think it’ll be “returned” right? It’ll go into your downpayment straight during second appt,btohqsg
it'll be returned to your bank account,btohqsg
2nd appointment only involves deduction from CPFOA unless you want to pay by NETS/cashier order,btohqsg
Oh so its like a deposit instead,btohqsg
unless you give up after the first appointment,btohqsg
I see . Ok thank you 🤗,btohqsg
Depends on how u wanna pay for your downpayment and stamp duty . If you're paying by fully by cpf then the option fee will be returned. If not the option fee will be used to offset.,btohqsg
I’m paying fully by CPF  but officer said it goes to our downpayment. It’s also stated in the HDB website it goes to the downpayment,btohqsg
I don’t think so right? It was told that it’s gonna be straight to downpayment,btohqsg
Hmm that’s weird  cause they told me non refundable when I asked,btohqsg
if u have enough OA  they will reimburse u the option fee. My option fee is reimbursed to me because i have more than enough OA,btohqsg
Ahh okie  cause I do have enough OA currently + I’ve got grant too,btohqsg
Confirm refund. I just received my refund of option fee last mth or so only,btohqsg
if you took up an otp  can you decide to proceed with a second one? Does buyer have to also wait 21 days?,btohqsg
Hello! Can I have new family/newly wed who apply for bto/SBF how many grants are there for us ?,btohqsg
resale.anyone knows?Buyer wants to cancel otp  how go do in HDB resale portal,btohqsg
even if someone here is able to help you with this question  maybe you have another question in doubt,btohqsg
answer to the qn: buyer no need to cancel otp  he can accept more than 1 otp and valuation per HDB resale officer  buyer no nd to wait 21 days,btohqsg
Those who applied as applicant + occupier  any idea if the occupier is allowed to go for the signing of lease appointment?,btohqsg
They won't be so strict right  2 people should be ok?,btohqsg
no problem even if it's not occupier,btohqsg
my wife and I accompanied my mum to the selection exercise despite we are not occupiers,btohqsg
can Absd be paid by cpf?,btohqsg
Just to share  the interest for bank loan will also change very fast when economy pick up🙂,btohqsg
hello  given that the best interest rate these days is in CPF OA  would it make sense that to save up for BTO  instead of putting in a bank  to contribute more CPF as a Self-employed person?,btohqsg
I think it does  the only downside is once you sell  you need to put the money back in cpf oa and can't use that cash. Should be good though if you want to use it for another property in future but just less flexibility,btohqsg
never put all the eggs in the same basket!,btohqsg
yes indeed. i guess it also depends on what are the options and conditions of available baskets 😅,btohqsg
Yes very subjective for every family. But  it can still be a viable option for some.,btohqsg
Anyone bto Dakota breeze? Is there tele group?Or anyone have a PDF version of 4-room floorplan?,btohqsg
Thank you! But I need the Hdb floorplan version on it,btohqsg
hdb floorplan need to buy usually,btohqsg
if you bought a unit there  can log into your MyHDBPage and click on the application information,btohqsg
should be able to get it there,btohqsg

do we know when the May BTO will be open?,btohqsg
haven't received any updates from HDB,btohqsg

Nope  must wait until aug this year then we will know things about 2022 bto,btohqsg
don't even have leak for Nov 2021 HAHA,btohqsg
hi guys  heard delay for currently building btos will be even more now? cause of migrant workers crunch,btohqsg
Those 98% - 99% completed  anyone has any news from hdb yet?,btohqsg
Hello! As long as i have the HLE letter means my HLE application is approved already ?,btohqsg
approved without the house ready also no use as you'd need to do HLE again before key collection,btohqsg
no and my project dropped from 98% to 83%,btohqsg
I think only after the stage of architectural work has completed  then can anticipate for keys collection,btohqsg
So is not possible to collect keys for those completed block since those 98-99% still hv not,btohqsg
Hmm based on what the HDB staff told me  key collections are based on block completion,btohqsg
The TOP tracker is based on the TOP date of respective projects,btohqsg
We are in the midst of Q2 hope can collect keys after hungry ghost festival,btohqsg
I visited the site almost every week. All those completed... they have blocked out from those still constructing.Crossing my fingers that I collect keys soon.,btohqsg
Because i will need it for the unit selection this month. So not sure whether it is approved or still in process ? 😅,btohqsg
If approved  the HLE letter will state the amount u can loan. U may login to HDB website to check,btohqsg
The amounts for 15  20 and 25 years right ? Cause what my friend received was only the 25 years one .,btohqsg
I received containing 15 20 25,btohqsg
Hi what’s the progress for fernvale glades at the site now?,btohqsg

Are the cranes all taken down?,btohqsg
Not for the other sides. The one near ju eng elderly home still have some.,btohqsg

Oh thought you got your keys on 1st May lol,btohqsg
So far they’ve yet to announce it,btohqsg
They will most likely announce it when May's BTO is launched. thats what they usually do.,btohqsg
Anyone knows when is the launch for may 2021?,btohqsg
Will May SBF 2021 be released?,btohqsg
My guess is on the 17th,btohqsg
I need some advice on the water heater and tap. Hope someone can help shed light on it.As we can see all new HDB comes with wall mounted shower sets with the option of hot and cold water. If we are using a normal instant heater  guess the in built shower set taps will be no difference in whichever direction we turn  right?,btohqsg
Hi guys I have a question. If I use my CPF to pay for the housing  from what I understand is  the Accrued interest that we get from our CPF stops coming in as we have to pay it back ourself if we sell the house. But if let’s say I’m not planning to sell the house  when will the AI starts coming back into effect? Isit once the principal sum plus AI are paid back from the CPF deductions?Sorry if this qns has been asked before first time buyer here,btohqsg
No sell house  no accrued interest.,btohqsg
What's coming in and coming back?,btohqsg
As long as you're not planning to sell your house can heck care the AI,btohqsg
Like example if I use the cpf to buy the house  the AI from cpf stops as we took out cpf money. Then if u sell somewhere down the years later u need to pay back the principal loan amount plus the AI over the years before the AI from the government starts to come back into effect right ? Cos all the loan amount plus the AI u suppose to get is paid back already.But if you don’t intend to sell at all. Will the AI that you get from not touching ur CPF in the first place come back once u paid finish the loan amount + interest of the say 25 year loan? Or like the AI won’t have ever till u sell it,btohqsg
AI not referring to annual interest right,btohqsg
Oh sorry. Maybe the terms not correct as I’m still reading and learning all the different scenarios. I meant if I don’t sell the house at all. I don’t need to pay the accrued interest back. But my cpf will also not get any interest since I used it to pay for the house right ?,btohqsg
U get interest on whatever is left in your cpf,btohqsg
As long as your monthly CPF still have balance after servicing the home loan,btohqsg
Ohhh okok. Thanks for clarifying 😅,btohqsg
The longer the 2nd appointment is the better  to drag the AI,btohqsg
The moment I have paid for the downpayment  the AI started to compute  $1500 for 3 years at $500/yr,btohqsg
It would remain the same till I collectes the keys,btohqsg
If for second appointment I need to pay 30k dp and 10k stamp duty  and I pay 36k via cash and 4k via cpf  will my 36k cash be split as 30k to downpayment and 6k to stamp duty? Or will be 75% (27k) to dp and 25% to stamp duty?,btohqsg
Coz in the first case if I switch to bank loan don't need to pay more cash  but second case then if I switch have to top up 3k cash?,btohqsg
If you don’t want fork cash (5%) then take hdb loan first then change to bank after key collection,btohqsg
Alr paying more than 5% by cash  but just wondering how they will split the cash,btohqsg
Must service the loan for at least 6 months before the switch,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter if you fork min 5% cash remaining in cpf/cash,btohqsg
You can only keep a max of 20k in your cpf OA the rest they will deduct away,btohqsg
As in I'm paying 36k cash for downpayment + stamp duty. But out of 36k  can I choose that 30k goes to downpayment and only 6k goes to stamp duty? So that I alr fulfil 5% cash downpayment so if I switch to bank loan no need to top up cash,btohqsg
If lets say they take my 36k and put 27k to downpayment  9k to stamp duty  then I no longer fulfil 5% cash downpayment right?,btohqsg
So you saying currently you are on HDB loan isit?,btohqsg
Why don’t you straight away change to bank loan. Isn’t that more straight forward with no hassle,btohqsg
So not even 1st appt yet?,btohqsg
Oh then mean you haven’t pay anything right other than the $2000,btohqsg
Don't want to opt for bank loan at this stage because need to pay 25% downpayment now,btohqsg
If switch next time only need to pay the 20% extra when switching?,btohqsg
Okay So from what I know bank loan you only 75% right so you have to pay 25% and 5% must be cash,btohqsg
But I don’t think they ask you buy 25% straight,btohqsg
I believe is 5% cash plus 5% (cash or cpf) for your first appt,btohqsg
Then remaining 10% is when you take your keys,btohqsg
HDB don’t collect the 25% straight away,btohqsg
Sorry man is better for you to check with bank on this cos I convert from HDB loan to bank,btohqsg
So I don’t have to fork cash out,btohqsg
Think just need to check if bank loan have staggered payment. 1st appt and 2nd appt (key collection),btohqsg
Oh ya I just did a search  property guru site says 5% cash and 5% cpf during signing of lease (under staggered downpayment scheme),btohqsg
I guess for now we will stick with HDB loan first and will check with the HDB officer on how to switch to bank loan,btohqsg
Switching to bank loan is easy. Is only whether you wanna pay the 5% cash or not,btohqsg
If yes anytime you can change but after key collect must go thru more hassle,btohqsg
Yup alr paying 36k cash for first appointment and 5% is 30k,btohqsg
But the 36k includes stamp duty payment,btohqsg
Hmm... I would suggest you to use CPF pay,btohqsg
Under deferred income assessment so no grant yet. And not much money in cpf so no choice,btohqsg
Cos not sure if the cash consider the 5% cos you taking HDB loan,btohqsg
Yea will check during signing of lease,btohqsg
Then should straight away go for bank loan and see whether both cpf OA can fill the 5%,btohqsg
Wa headache haha anyway can email them to ask before going first appt,btohqsg
Nvm haha since we can only go with hdb loan now  we don't have a choice. Worst case either pay another 5% cash next time  or stick to hdb loan for 6 months then switch,btohqsg
So have to pay 2.6% HDB loan interest for min 6 months,btohqsg
But I don’t have to fork out cash cos my loan amount enough,btohqsg
For bank loan  5% cash for deposit and a few thousands for stamp duty.The 5% cash for deposit & stamp duty must be paid in full upon signing of lease.. the stamp duty can be paid fully from CPF.The 5% cash is paid in separate cashier’s order from the stamp duty. So in total ur lawyer will issue 2 cashier’s order to HDB if u are taking bank loan.So for the question of whether u can specify how much is meant for deposit and how much is for stamp duty  I think it’s possible to arrange that with Hdb officer if u are taking Hdb loan now.But if u are paying all 36k by cash  then u r already fulfilling the 5% cash in deposit,btohqsg
Anyone knows why some projects have the covid sign and some dont have ?,btohqsg

Nope. My wild guess is it could be tomorrow or Weds. Otherwise  could be 27 28 or 30 May but my guess is that is unlikely.,btohqsg
Anyone receive invitation to select unit for yishun sbf nov 2020 alr ?,btohqsg
Signing of lease appt got postponed,btohqsg
We were too kiasu and prepared our CO in advance. So nothing to cheer about since once withdraw no more bank interest,btohqsg
Don't think will go through the trouble of cancelling the CO since it costs $5,btohqsg
Any idea whether the selection is delayed or not?,btohqsg
If i didnt receive any email then it means mine not delayed right,btohqsg
