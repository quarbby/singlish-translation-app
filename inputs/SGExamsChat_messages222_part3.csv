the pace is still the same,btohqsg
Actl i alw wanted social work but i alr decides to take it as postgrad diploma so,btohqsg
and y1 isn't a honeymoon year,btohqsg
Can la but id rather get a uni degree related to my poly diploma,btohqsg
then which uni degree u want?,btohqsg
probably not big 3 I think,btohqsg
y'all thinking too far  take it ez,btohqsg
don't recall big 3 having anything related to tourism,btohqsg
idk tbh but when I applied don't have alr,btohqsg
Singapore not promoting tourism as much liao,btohqsg
my friends volunteers as a museum guide kek,btohqsg
or if i gd enough im gna go to psych,btohqsg
bc i cmi to psych in poly,btohqsg
hii  can I check if my eng and hcl get the same grade wld they use eng or hcl for L1r5?,btohqsg
I think they get the betttr oneIf same then wont matter which one they choose,btohqsg
cos if they use hcl for L1 then I canâ€™t use it to minus another 2 from my l1r5 :/,btohqsg
Prolly they go for ur best score,btohqsg
Eii this one must ask my friend alr,btohqsg
No la  they only use HCL if its better than your english,btohqsg
if same  then your english is used and you get the bonus points,btohqsg
if not how do people get into RI HAHA,btohqsg
Go and rep nation after that dae inside ig?,btohqsg
As in it got more pops recently,btohqsg
Is it? Tot it has always been . Partly also cos they accept larger cohort size,btohqsg
got so many major inside one course  ofc popular la,btohqsg
The RP went up by quite a bit last year tho,btohqsg
Probably gonna maintain cut off this year too,btohqsg
English  then your HCl can be used for 2 bonus points. Another case: EL A2  HCl A1. Its still a better score to use EL as a grade and get 2 bonus points from HCl  so that's how its computed.,btohqsg
Pass EL and Higher Mother tongue = 2 bonus points. Of course  for your L1R5  you would use the one with the better grade.,btohqsg
im pretty decided but i felt like asking for advice,btohqsg
i got 26 raw and nett for os (l1r4) so shld i go to poly or ite,btohqsg
if you can go into a course that you think you can remotely tahan  then poly  otherwise go to a course that you're interested in in ITE,btohqsg
i'm interested in sports sci and/or hospitality,btohqsg
damn 1 point more and my life wld be easier,btohqsg
so i think you should defo at least put some poly courses as your first choice,btohqsg
school of sports aso got a couple of courses,btohqsg
Guys home schooled student got diff cut off than sch students meh?,btohqsg
but isnt sports science like 15,btohqsg
yeah i hv mixed feelings abt these,btohqsg
just asking   isit very risky if i put all choices which the cop i meet borderline?,btohqsg
then like first few the cop lower by 1 or 2,btohqsg
Can someone give me some advice. Shld i go to njc or nyjc? I live in bukit panjang so njc is nearer to my house. However i heard nyjc is really good (3rd in sg i think) but its like an hour journey from my house. I am really confused on which one i shld i put as my 1st choice.,btohqsg
Which school's culture do you prefer? And consider the subjects and ccas offered in both jcs,btohqsg
put a couple that you know u confirm can make it in as a safety net,btohqsg
You could spend more time doing stuff with less travel time,btohqsg
I dun really care about culture i guess. I am intending to take 4H2 Phy  Computing  Math  Econs.,btohqsg
And u can wake up earlier  sleep later,btohqsg
for myself i think travel time isn't as much of a concern bah. a lot if ppl in my school travel the country to get to MI and still do decently well,btohqsg
