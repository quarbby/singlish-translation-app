Hi guys. Does grabpay and Amex true cash back  still works ?,btohqsg
Hmmmâ€¦ this house is built around 1998. Its about 25 years old. By right still have 75 years lease. If we sell 25 year lease toGovernment what happens to the 50 years? Someone told me 247k is the rental amount we need to pay government.,btohqsg
You can also use xnap which will link to your credit card to pay for hawker food if this option is available. Food courts like kopitiam and food republic can also pay with card. All these are eligible spending that will count towards min spend for most cards.Nothing wrong with spending $600+ a month if he/she can afford it  everyone have different needs. Donâ€™t be so quick to pass judgement when we are all here to learn.,btohqsg
Wait till 1 year later tho,btohqsg
You can stay till the 50 years lease expires then return back to the Govt. If your dad leaves before 50 years lease up  Hdb will prorate the dollar value for the remaining years to you,btohqsg
Download xnap apps  and scan SGQR that has xnap logo when buying food from hawker. The payment will be deducted from the credit card that linked to your Apple Pay/Google Pay  n pay to the hawker.,btohqsg
Only this ? SGQR? Now about those store using normal qr ?,btohqsg
Normal QR can only use paynow  no much benefit,btohqsg

Hi  i would like to share my little experience with ShopBack.If you use a fair share of food delivery service especially from Deliveroo  you get back up to 10% voucher discount or more. Tag your voucher purchase to any of your cashback CC  you earn cashback again. Which means you earn cashback from both sides.There are many direct vouchers saving from Shopback you can explore for saving which are so much higher from CC. Charging vouchers purchase to your cadhback CC  you earn 2nd round of cashback.,btohqsg
Maybe u can call their hotline or customer service for enquiries...,btohqsg
If you shop at Cold Storage and Giant  purchase Vouchers from ShopBack for 3% cashback... there are different voucher value to choose from $10  $20  $30 etc,btohqsg
What is the mcc code? Is it 6540?,btohqsg
Sorry  i m not sure about their mcc code. But no worries  i have been earning all cash back from whichever CC i use that tag to Shopback App.,btohqsg
Hi guys   can I check for Suica virtual card   if topup via dbs WWMC and uob PPV. Will both get 4mpd rewards ?,btohqsg
Depending on which card strategy. Works only if you want to fulfill â€˜onlineâ€™ category. I prefer to charge direct as I need to fulfill â€˜groceriesâ€™ category.,btohqsg
Got to use Shopback in a smart way. For supermarkets   Cold Storage and Giant vouchers 3% cashback.Deliveroo vouchers can range from 5% to 10% on different value purchase or when there is a promo.At coffeshops  food courts or other mall merchants/restaurants  use it if you frequently visit them to get back your previous visit cashback amount. The App smartly tracks everything for you at your view.Mostly i prefer to purchase vouchers.Ppl who shop online with Shein  the vouchers discount is v high too.,btohqsg
Explore the App  you will find more on how best you can make use to save while spending... at the same time earning cashback from our CC.,btohqsg

HSBC Revo points can redeem as Cashback too. back into cc statement.,btohqsg
thanks  how to get the reference id ?i dont see in the SMS,btohqsg
Anyone can share any tactic to pay $500 on Uob one credit cardKeppel electric sp group and StarHub all donâ€™t want to accept one time payment.Can I go to sp group Toa Payoh service centre and pay credit card in person ?Intention is to fulfil 1k spending needs,btohqsg
Sp didnâ€™t allow advance payment the last time I tried.,btohqsg
For HsBC Revo  if I apply now can I immediately use it ? Or need wait physical card ?,btohqsg
Buy Ntuc physical vouchers at the customer service. This is counted as grocery spend.,btohqsg
Sorry I don't know. I normally wait for physical cards.. I am old school.,btohqsg
If u have the HSBC app  u can use the virtual card but need to activate it 1st.The issue that I had a dilemma on is that I was worried that my physical card get lost in transition then if I activate the card le and itâ€™s lost  then there is a risk.So safer to wait for card to arrive then activateTo add:U can try add virtual card to online platforms but some platforms might allow u to add but when u try to pay  kena rejected coz not activated.Last time I added virtual HSBC revo to ShopBack  but when I tried to pay  rejected coz havenâ€™t activated.Also  once u activate  it might take 1 day for these platforms to update also.,btohqsg
Any idea how to value it is 2.5% cashback? I check n it is about 1% only. Eg. Spend $100 n earn 400 points. Every 400 points can use it to pay $1 bill.,btohqsg
As long as any of the main NTUC outlets that got customer service to buy the vouchers from then can.Ie the aunty will ask u pay by what  then u say visa pay wave then once u pay  she go get the vouchers and pass to u. Then u can use the vouchers to manage your cash flow.I use this tactic to meet credit card promos but if u are not sure  best to buy $5 NTUC voucher 1st then wait for the transaction to be posted then call the bank and ask if the mcc code is valid and itâ€™s a qualifying transaction. If yes  then u can buy more.,btohqsg
U spend $1000U get 1000 point end month  9000 point end of next month. Total 10k pointSince 400 points = $110 000 / 400 = $25Then$25 / $1000 x 100% = 2.5%Then if unlock HSBC Everyday+ Rewards programme  u get extra 1% cash rebate to your EGA account about 1-2 days after transaction posted.So effectively u get2.5% in points1% in cash rebate with EGA Everyday+ rewards programme,btohqsg
Miles and points different bro. HSBC points is 10 points per dollar. So $100 spend is 1000 points. This will  equal to $2.5.,btohqsg
And then can I use the ntuc vouchers through FairPrice app?Is there equivalent voucher in Cold Storage or giant since Uob one got additional cashback there,btohqsg
U go buy your NTUC groceriesAt payment the aunty ask u if u ntuc member  say yes n show her your NTUC FairPrice app (which u should have sign up before if not pls do it and set up the payment to UOB one credit card or whatever card u want to charge groceries to).Once she scan then she will ask u how u want to pay. U give her the vouchers. Then if got balance  u just say u pay by appShe will offset total cost minus the physical vouchers and the remaining charged to your card that u linked in FairPrice app,btohqsg
I think only NTUC sell physical vouchers. Other supermarkets donâ€™t.They sell digital vouchers.I personally wonâ€™t want to risk buying digital vouchers coz some people say it wonâ€™t count as eligible spend on some other cards like DBS yuu card unless u mix some groceries spending with the voucher spending etc but idk if they closed this lobang already or not.Just stick with ntuc physical vouchers. Tried and proven method.If u want to sleep in peace  but $5 1st to test then call bank to check mcc code if valid transaction to count to quota.,btohqsg
