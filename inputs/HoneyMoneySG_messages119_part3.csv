Is it! Should have sign up for Jun step up.üò¢,btohqsg
No need to as long as qualified and month ended. HSBC will remember and pay u the interest by promised date.Caveat. Account must be in good standing.,btohqsg
Just checked with the HSBC CSO  was told the same principal amount (fresh fund) needs to be kept in the account till bonus interest is being credited. She verified with another specialist knowledgeable in EGA.,btohqsg
Not true  bonus interest take ard 3 month to credit,btohqsg
Which means in the month of Sept & Oct  you will be earning a prevailing interest rates of 0.05% üòû,btohqsg
Bluff u oneU get cso to email u in black and white. Confirm can get compensation vouchers for lying. Haha üòù,btohqsg
"Not talking about the timeline here. But principal needs to remain in the account till you get the bonus interest. I even asked if maintaining minimum amount will do  she verified with the ""specialist"" again and answer is NO.",btohqsg
I am telling i dont maintain it and i get the bonus interest  alot of user here also get it without maintaining,btohqsg
I am assuming you have EGA and no problems so far?,btohqsg
Since day 1. No issue because I‚Äôm kiasu and kiasi. And never just in time. And never just enough.,btohqsg
Unless they changed it I also got the bonus interest  withdrew after my bonus interest months,btohqsg
There is no tnc to maintain the fund after the bonus interest period,btohqsg
Actually I said the same thing. That's when she verified with her colleague again.,btohqsg
If it is not in tnc then it is not  like i say cso can give wrong info at times,btohqsg
Yep. Understand. Not all CSO are knowledge in terms of all the products.,btohqsg
does anyone know at what time does UK vfs release appointment slots for tourist visa? I'm not able to get an appointment since the last 1 month,btohqsg
If I cancel Amex platinum  can I still pay the bill that‚Äôs posted after my cancellation date?,btohqsg
Hi. Is there any latest new SCB referral code that I can use to apply for the SC bonus savers bank,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Hi Understand that maximum monthly spend for citi rewards card to earn 4MPD is $1k.Would like to check if i have *monthly instalment of $500*.Does that means I only have remaining $500 to spend to qualify for 4MPD?Anyone expert can advise?Thanks üôè,btohqsg
It is not in the TnC now but if more n more People calls CSO to check  it will be in the TnC in the future.üòÅ,btohqsg
Hii any advice on where to put ~$100-$150k and which cc to use to hit the min spend? Is ocbc 360 the best now?,btohqsg
There's a t&c change on this. I this round chicken out stay in SCB  wait for dp from people who chiong in,btohqsg
Huh. U mean u agree with HSBC cso? Which clause,btohqsg
Oh. This one I‚Äôm pretty sure is typo. BUT why keep in EGA month 2. Move out LiaoOp was worried about cso saying funds must stay in EGA until bonus interest paid. No way this is real.,btohqsg
Sometimes their t&c really anyhow one,btohqsg
Recycle the wording won't change.. but they add additional line,btohqsg
Recycle using competitor language cut and paste. Haha,btohqsg
my understanding  you dont even need to maintain the money for july and august. That's why some people are using 2 accounts to rotate the money between the 2 accounts to get additional 1% bonus interest from top-up amount,btohqsg
I would think at this moment uob one account with 150k is the best,btohqsg
Hi can check. The stock cash coupon  minimum order amount is how much?,btohqsg
Hello  I‚Äôm an existing lady‚Äôs cardholder and have successfully upgraded to solitaire. I have received the approval sms on 30th June and saw the new card in the PIB site on the same day but card was only reflected in my tmrw app today. Will the second category take effect this quarter or only on 1 Oct?,btohqsg
No min  but each coupon is S$10  so will buy S$10 at least,btohqsg
Thanks  the coupon can use to fulfill the second condition of cash coupon reward?,btohqsg
You are right. They edited already lol,btohqsg
Which card to use for the $500 min spend though. The $800 min spend for evol is a bit high for me to hit per month. I don‚Äôt qualify for the solitaire yet so if i get lady‚Äôs card  it‚Äôs only 1 cat ü•≤,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt a supervisor proof read the tnc before it‚Äôs posted. Sheesh.,btohqsg
Maybe their supervisor also outsourced? ü§™,btohqsg
Not sure  but I used pure cash for BUY trades to avoid any confusion,btohqsg
Check with cso on uob chat assist the new card cat,btohqsg
Hmm ok. Will go look up more abt it. Thank you!,btohqsg
If I cancelled a credit card one year ago as I didn‚Äôt want to pay the annual fee second year onwards  if I apply again now  will the first year fee still be free?,btohqsg
Sorry not sure why I can't reply on your query. Yup I am using uob one card too. Transport and food all are accepted so pretty easy to hit 500,btohqsg
The only downside is that I have to always ensure that i spend a min of $500 consecutively right?,btohqsg
Wa for posb investment  if u sold off before the marker move  it won‚Äôt count for the month?,btohqsg
do you pay for any of the household bills? that could be included as well,btohqsg

Nope. Don‚Äôt have any utility bills yet so would have to rely on transport and dining as u mentioned.,btohqsg
For the CitiPayAll  we need to spend $5000 on non-tax transaction fee. Does the CitiPayAll service fee counted under this $5000?,btohqsg
My transport would take like 100 or so and probably the food at my work place ain't cheap so I managed to hit 500 without fail usually. You could consider buying stuffs at ntuc etc to clock the spending.,btohqsg
