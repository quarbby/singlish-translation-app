need to earn more miles after the $1k but most 4mpd only cap 1k,btohqsg
hm  electronics mcc no more under bonus mcc  and no more for big item above $1k. Read the latest TnC for ocbc titanium rewards.,btohqsg
yup but among the recent big singsaver promo (cimb  citi  sc) only cimb excludes amaze,btohqsg
hsbc revo is visa  cant link to amaze  only mastercard can be link,btohqsg
I know about hsbc I just make sure that MCC 8021 is an eligible spend . I would like to link it to Citi PremiumMiles card not hsbc,btohqsg
So it mean most likely would be consider as a eligible spend if I link CitiPremier master card into amaze and use amaze to spend on dental clinics,btohqsg
Well from the T&Cs we don't see anywhere that it might be excluded,btohqsg
Cos I using miles card toGet 1 $ 7 miles. HSBC and other card not charging. Only Citibank. And after checking they told me this transaction is made via Agoda HK thus causing this . My hsbc is under Agoda sg,btohqsg
But hsbc is under visa . No charge so far,btohqsg
Hi  can check where can we trade futures for Calf?,btohqsg
Wah shit this card CMI already like that,btohqsg
CITIfrom the T&Cs don't see anywhere that it might be excluded,btohqsg
Does CITI premier miles credit card exclude XNAP payment?,btohqsg
no  but why not use 4mpd/6mpd cards instead?,btohqsg
So I need to make a payment at the Celson furniture store MCC 5712.Can I confirm that even the UOB Visa Signature card (typically used for FX) is a good one to get 4mpd for a contactless transaction?I have already use up the max benefit of the UOB preferred platinum card (which I got after seeing it here on Honey Money)  so wanted to use a different card provided I get 4mpd.,btohqsg
Hi. Im new to the credit card world. I dont know where to start. Any tips for me? Im looking for a credit card for Transportation & daily use with now minimum spending monthly if possible.,btohqsg
Standard chartered Smart card. No minimum spend,btohqsg
Basically my question is does UOB Visa Signature give 4 mpd on SGD contactless?,btohqsg
Yes. But need min spend $1000 contactless on that statement month.,btohqsg
hi anyone got any experience (or issues) receiving a refund when shopee cancels an order and when the payment was via instarem linked to citi rewards? they lost my parcel and triggered an auto refund but not sure if it's gonna be an issue since payment was made via instarem,btohqsg
generally not an issue  although amaze may reject the refund (merchant usually will retry) and ask you to link to wallet to receive it instead,btohqsg
thanks fish. haha hopefully they wont reject.. 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Hi all  can anyone recommend me any credit card that could be useful for monthly wedding expenses?1) will be paying $5k up front +$2.5k monthly subsequently2) I do own HSBC revo for dailies so is UOB lady card a good choice?3) is paying for annual fee actually worth it for mileage (I am kind of new to credit card),btohqsg
what kind of merchants? paying online/contactless?,btohqsg
Hi and thanks!Visa/master - 3641Amex -7011Online transaction,btohqsg
DBS WWMC and UOB Lady’s Card,btohqsg
I always get confused by whether Commune for example has an online store but also a physical store  so is it the same MCC?,btohqsg
Third time I called Moomoo  now the TNC change again. current funds must not be withdrawn to bank account  else ineligible for second round promo 5.8%,btohqsg
GxS debit card is now available ooo,btohqsg
how many %cashback to be expected?,btohqsg
so unsubscribe from the fund and subscribe again can?,btohqsg
Hi all  Just signed up for the SCB Smart Card via Singsaver Promo. Need to spend $250 within 30 days.Can someone advise if i were to go McDonalds and buy $250 worth of vouchers  would it be qualified as Eligible and Qualifying transactions for the bonus points and singsaver spending criteria?,btohqsg
Similar to Gpay  cashback is based on luck.1transaction (min SGD$10 / FX equivalent) can only get1chance to get up to $5 (not sure what's the minimum  could be $0  could be $0.01  could be $1).E.g. $9.99 transaction will get 0 chance  $10 transaction will get 1 chance  $100 transaction will also get 1 chance.Cashback will be credited directly to GXS Main Account  and isalso limited by the $75k maximum balance. So if you have over $75  your cashback is instantly $0 for all transactions.Transaction exclusions similar to standard credit/debit card exclusions (i.e. but not limited to  wallet top-ups  wire transfer  charity  gambling) ANDall Grab app related transactions.- It's a MasterCard with 0 FX fees.- Not sure if can pair with Instarem to double dip  might not be worth also.- Currently cannot add to mobile payment wallets (i.e. Gpay  Apple Pay  Samsung Pay).- 1.2x Grab points on Grab app related transactions.,btohqsg
Assuming if they use same payment terminal as u order at counter  it would be eligible,btohqsg
Okay thank you for the clarification. Will try it out :),btohqsg
Didn't ask about that. My plan is to withdraw to bank account to subscribe for upcoming SSB  which has high chance of not being able to get fully subscribed  then I plan to redeposit back to Moomoo.,btohqsg
Honestly the state at launch is quite horrible  unless used for FX transactions.,btohqsg
Refer to Melvyn's msg above  it explains very well,btohqsg
Actually I don't think pairing with amaze is a good idea since it already has 0 fx fees,btohqsg
It's more for the double dipping in InstaPoints AND gxs cashback. Since both also min $10 sgd FX equivalent,btohqsg
Mmm  but think about it  the 2% spread is not worth the 1% instapoint cashback,btohqsg
Who knows.. the $10 can get you $5 cashback.. 🌚,btohqsg
think better to pair Amaze with other mastercard for higher sure rebate/points,btohqsg
Hahaha that's why 🤣 honestly the card is a quite a bad card as of the launch state,btohqsg
hi  anyone got experience recommending a forwarder from US to SG? planning to get some tech stuff from amazon US and newegg but some dont ship to SG,btohqsg
ok lah maybe they trying to keep it sustainable  not like the 3.5% which was gone so fast,btohqsg
thank you! i see ezbuy  comegateway and buyandship recommended most often  comgateway seems more ex right,btohqsg
Haha clearly targeted for those who still using gxs bank account..,btohqsg
I see  didn't know that's a trick to get miles from insurance,btohqsg
yeah.I believe ezbuy is currently one of the cheaper US forwarding services if you're looking for cost,btohqsg
I recently used ezship by ezbuy to ship from US  same situation as you,btohqsg
Does UOB Preferred Platinum Visa give 4 mpd for Ticketmaster? Heymax seems to say so,btohqsg

So can I transfer out and back again?,btohqsg
No. Please go and read the T&Cs,btohqsg
it is based on incremental fresh fund minus day end fund on 30 sep,btohqsg
that are not withdrawn from any existing UOB current/savings account and re-deposited (whetherpart or all of the amounts withdrawn) into the Account indicated in the Registration (as definedbelow) at any time during the Promotion Period.🥺,btohqsg
My One Account just started late week.,btohqsg
the incremented fund wil be locked for 4 months and rem ..ONLY 1 time per pax...irregardless how many UOB account u have..can only tag to one...,btohqsg

With intention to transfer $150K to other banks for FD.,btohqsg
can..then u just fill up and choose the 200k one..,btohqsg
fill up the 100k one is the most optimal,btohqsg
Not wise because one account is only 0.05% after 100k iirc,btohqsg
this can only occur after that 4 months lock/earmark period..haha,btohqsg
ya..that's why..no worth to have over 100k inside,btohqsg
That's why the rest above $100K I do FD with other banks better,btohqsg
yup..she right..if u wanna move another 150k..then u just go for the xmas promo for 100k,btohqsg
u are effective getting ard 2.9 percent for that extra 100k for the saving promo while u can get better rate of fixed deposit at 3.5 percent on the market now,btohqsg

ya..that's why i thinking throw into CIMB..haha,btohqsg
I have no intention of withdrawing that sum in the next 3-5 years I think there should be no risk with that amount t of time,btohqsg
then ya u can park in usd fd ,btohqsg
Sorry what u meant for this sentence?,btohqsg
Just transfer 100k in to the new uob one acct for the saving promotion,btohqsg

Referring to cpf shielding product for that few days,btohqsg
Does anyone knows the uob one account new account opening every friday promo first 100 customer  does it run out very fast?,btohqsg
Would like to check does recurring starhub bills work for Citi rewards?,btohqsg
One of the more stable funds approved by cpf sa. Shielding requires using a fund where u don’t want the price to move up or down too much.Since mmfs are not cpf sa approved  this short term bond fund is the closest.,btohqsg
How long is the shielding period? So funds will be redeemed and moved back to SA once RA is formed.,btohqsg
What happens to the interest monies for a Maxed out Medisave account on Dec 31?1. On Dec 31  the interest monies in MA to flow into SA as MA is maxed out.2. On Dec 31  the interest monies in MA will stay in MA as 1st Jan MA limit is increase.,btohqsg
I’ll give it 1-2 weeks after RA is formed before selling the bond fund.,btohqsg
Eventually the result is (1).Can refer to this video  and I'll do a 2023 update when the news is outhttps://youtu.be/zj4pW_VeKpw?si=XD2F7U5-jpX7_y1s&t=244,btohqsg
#dpopened at 12am on that day. approved the next day; saturdsy at 3pm lol,btohqsg
Did you get the cash for being the first 100 customer to open the account too?,btohqsg
SG t-bill currently almost 4% plus upfront coupon  can beat all those unit trusts. Looks like on par with SA 4%. Why use unit trusts for shielding? I can only think of holding period difference.,btohqsg
If u are not using ocbc u have to go down in person to buy tbills using cpf sa.,btohqsg
Don’t not touch CPF SA! I mean you can but only when the yield is high like 5-6% not now!,btohqsg
You will be losing 1-2 months of interest buying Tbill not worth it now,btohqsg
How does it work. Must time it? Or don’t withdraw to CPF account on maturity?,btohqsg
The context is for shielding. Not daily.,btohqsg
Only if you are 54 years old…View this video.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/36838,btohqsg
Probably won’t apply to me since Im not drawing CPF and unlikely to every hit FRS,btohqsg
I’m ahead of CPF board. They don’t let me do shielding nvm I’m intending to give up my passport and withdraw all my CPF. See what they want to say now. 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
What is the reason not allowed shielding?,btohqsg
Watch the video loh. CPF scared the boomers go shield until lose money then kpkb CPF board,btohqsg
Even bid Tbill not guaranteed get full allotment unless you lowball and if get a freak yield also will lose interest. There is always a risk,btohqsg
Don’t want risk just do nothing,btohqsg
Where's the next destination after giving up your passport?,btohqsg
🥺 umm hi guys  i got the CIMB AWSM card when i was a student  $500 credit limit no minimum spend and no annual fee… was wondering if there’s other cards with no Minimum spend and no annual fee since i just started my first FT Job…,btohqsg

Some issues I identified with retiring in JP:- Earthquakes- Language- Xenophobia- Depreciating currency- Aging population,btohqsg
CIMB Credit card and HSBC Revolution do not charge annual fee,btohqsg
Yeah i agree. Ruiming from Woke Salaryman already has a retirement house in Japan,btohqsg
I’m leaning towards TW rather than JP due to cultural differences. Even though I can speak the language I hate many aspects of the culture,btohqsg

hey chris  citigold call and say you are doing MISREPRESETATION. they are going after you now. standby for call. they say that if there is a fixed deposit placement  singsaver promo prize will not apply now.,btohqsg
ya they no longer accept FD placement as part of the criteria for promo prize,btohqsg
when did they changed? singsaver cockup or citibank,btohqsg
actually can just leave the $250k there in savings acc as AUM,btohqsg
Where did you get rthe message that I said fixed deposit will qualify for singsaver rewards?,btohqsg
It merely mentioned a fixed deposit rate by citigold. And there is a singsaver promo for citigold.,btohqsg
250k in tbill is 3.8% yield for 6mth is more than the promo money.,btohqsg
singsaver promot dont apply if its a fixed d placement apparently. u can talk to singsaver or citigold for clarification. not sure if they will take action on u. better remove ur video.,btohqsg
yes. i know. previously they accept FD as part of AUM for the promo prizes. So was a better deal compared to now,btohqsg
so i meants that chris cockup and show the wrong info.,btohqsg
see the date on singsaver. its 31 may 2023 ending.,btohqsg
Actually whatever  wherever the case  please do ur own due deligence to check on any offers.You can't be joining some free update channels and expect every word taken from it to be the 100% truth.Even every investment channels will put a disclaimer on it.,btohqsg
of course i did  thats what was discovered. it is important for finfluencer to be precise and remove fake info as much as possible.,btohqsg
You sue Chris any lawyer or judge will laugh at you man.,btohqsg
i dont bother  its citibank that say one.,btohqsg
First of all  I have not associated signing up for Singsaver with the 3.7% p.a. promo. These are two separate thing.Secondly I have already pointed out to you the T&Cs document. Point 2 already put it out there.Thirdly  there were no sign-ups for Citigold via my link ever since that video. So I am not sure where you come from.,btohqsg
There is no way to prove liability since he is not an FA and forcing you to signup that offer by promising a prize,btohqsg
ok lah  u song can liao. whatever it is  your video on fixed deposit  then citigold narrative is quite obvious pointing to citibank customer have 3.7 deposit via singsaver,btohqsg
of course  let them go sort out lor. who cares.,btohqsg
If u did then kudos to u.I think even if u did not check and apply with approval from citigold.The most u know cannot get the prize or the FD. Thats about it.,btohqsg
Citibank at most issue cease and desist if there is false info or a correction order,btohqsg
ya la. see what happens lor.,btohqsg
Yes and that is not a loss so nothing will be awarded,btohqsg

Hi  if I use my amaze card (that is linked to my partners cc) and my passport to purchase an item while overseas in Japan  can I check which of the following are feasible options:1) Apply for tax refund to my amaze card (will there be problems with this as I’m not sure if amaze card allows fund transfer? Previously had some problems with getting refunds for hotel bookings)2) Apply for refund to the amaze linked cc which belongs to my partner (but the amaze card that I used to buy the item was under my name)3) Apply for tax refund to my own Revolut card/ my own cc (which is not the same as the amaze card or my partners cc that was used to buy the item)Many thanks in advance 🙏,btohqsg

it is best to opt for cash refund when doing tax refund at departmental store global tax refund  certain store will do the tax refund deduction from final bill on the spot in japan  like clothing (uniqlo  eu)  pharmacy and places like loft  just need to go to special counter and tell them tax free. do note that not all stores under same merchant will have tax free options.,btohqsg
ichange but u need to pay for atm withdrawal fee.,btohqsg
when u do a tax refund to card u are subjected to the exchange rate by bank so best to get cash from the tax refund counter and just use it at merchant that dont take card.,btohqsg
oh forgot to mention  japanese very book by book  the card use must match your passport name  even if the card is using christian name but not in your passport they will ask alot  judging by this i think they will also be rigid when u request tax refund to a different card that is not use for the spending,btohqsg

How come your transaction can have 31 November? Which phone you are using?,btohqsg
Posting date is after Transaction date,btohqsg
Considered as Dec. All transactions counted must be POSTED in the month of period stated.,btohqsg
refunded amount will reduce the card spending amount  need to topup spending,btohqsg
Usually the EGA deduction for dbs credit card for giro will be on which day of the month upon approval yesterday ?,btohqsg

Among the supermarkets  Cold storage posts the transactions fastest. Sheng Siong voucher doesn't have expiry date  Nov 25 is still early. Should be able to get posted by Nov 30 if you buy today.,btohqsg
$417 x 0.4 miles / 2 = 83 UNI$Correct. It is 83 UNI$,btohqsg
But since RA already created  does this still works for above 55?,btohqsg
well don't use this grp to advertise your referral then 😂,btohqsg
But u need to check on your statement to see if giro is effected by dbs even though it have been approve incase u miss payment.,btohqsg

anyone got tip on how to save 10-20K at 16-18 yr old   I'm still young but wanna be a entrepreneur in the future. Currently schooling but have a part time job that's pays $10/HR. I also use to have a side hustle on carou but I stop liao cuz no time haha.Now my sch savings (CDA) got like 10K already but only can use for schooling until 21 yr old den can withdraw.Norm saving POSB got about 1.3K  interest vv jialat (0.03¢)/ monthMaybank 1.3K oso  interest for me is (0.20¢)/ month quite good lah.I can't invest in stocks/crypto/webull or wtv investment things cuz I not yet min age to do that .So only can count on working more and getting bursary haha,btohqsg
At 16-18  you can park funds at high saving accounts with no salary requirements like CIMB Fastsaver. Change your bank account is the first step. After that can slowly read about investing,btohqsg
Yep when I research about banks I saw that CIMB had the highest interest,btohqsg
Yes it still work for MA.. u can also top up RA  but personally I wouldn't do it,btohqsg
Just study hard now. Money will grow exponentially next time.,btohqsg
Yup. I won’t top up RA. Thanks  will check on MA Topup,btohqsg
Study and balanced with a good life  find your purpose & meaning  enjoy your youth,btohqsg
I don't like studying 😅 but I like computing so sometimes I help people in computing haha   might be working in that field.,btohqsg
Yes in future maybe get a degree in computing etc  can work and earn big bucks. When you have big bucks  you can grow that money quicker rather than grow $1000 right now which gives you less than $5 right now when you invest etc.,btohqsg
haha agreed. That time I bought Spotify stocks on Revolut for $1 and I earned $0.01 back . It was my first time investing 😂😂,btohqsg
Hi  I just applied for Citirewards credit card and linked my card to amaze. Do I have to use the amaze card for spending in order to get the 10x points or just citirewards in applepay will do?,btohqsg
Mobile wallet transaction is not eligible. Use your amaze card to paywave,btohqsg
What is cpf shielding  mmfs etc??,btohqsg

Haha. You post this question everywhere. Perhaps search chat history can give you some clues. Or check usinghttps://heymax.ai/search,btohqsg
TNC doesn't state so actually i believe both are acceptable but i would recommend you do a ONE SHOT deposit from OUTSIDE bank with a clear remark it is for uob earmark promo,btohqsg

Hi everyone  was wondering if the UOB Visa Signature is a good substitute for HSBC Revo/Citi Rewards paired with Amaze? Reason being trying to consolidate everything under UNI$ and the min S$1 000 spend is not an issue. Thank you!,btohqsg
Yup if u can hit 1k on paywave monthly,btohqsg
I think by far uob have quite alot of good card like uob vs  uob ppv  uob lady that give 4-6mpd  and uob one and uob evol that give reasonable cashback plus the uob one account which is why i tend to have alot of uni$ as all their uni$ pool together,btohqsg
Yeah that’s what I am trying to do too. Somemore I read that the VS card still awards the Bonus UNI$ for UOB$ merchants and it consolidates the spending vs the PPV which awards based on every $5 for each transaction.,btohqsg
Apologies for stupid question. Visa can now be paired with Amaze?,btohqsg

If I refund the tourist tax at airport to amaze card  the refund will be credited to the link card right?,btohqsg
Also if I refund hotel payment paid through amaze card  the full amount will be refunded or will be subjected to foreign exchange at the point of refund?,btohqsg

Hi for singapore savings bonds  anyone knows the allocation method if its over subscribed? Is there a difference if i bid for 150k or 200k? Will allocation be a fraction of my bid or by some fixed amount?,btohqsg
No difference. Maximum allocation is the quantity ceiling which is the same for everyone.With the quantity ceiling format  applying for a larger amount does not mean you will get more bonds. You should apply only for the amount you wish to buy.,btohqsg
Hi all  for the CPF top-up to your parents of up to $8k for tax relief  are there any conditions (eg. your parent’s CPF account cannot be maxed out alr etc)?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Hi all  can i link uob one card with samsung pay??,btohqsg
Meaning everyone who applies will get at least $500 allocation  unless the over subscription doesn’t allow this. Then it’s balloting time - some will get  some don’t,btohqsg
Hi can i check  if my uob giro fall on 4 dec (mon)  is the deduction 1 working day before meaning 1(friday? or 2 dec (sat),btohqsg
If your application is:Equal to or less than the cutoff amount  you will get the full amount you applied for.Above the cutoff amount  you will get either the cutoff amount or $500 more than the cutoff amount. The additional $500 is randomly distributed.,btohqsg
Each applicant will receive at least $500 of Savings Bonds. The amount will increase in multiples of $500 for every applicant until either an applicant has received the full amount applied for  or until all the available bonds have been allotted  whichever comes first.If the number of applicants is so large that issuing $500 per applicant will exceed the amount of bonds available  the bonds will be allocated among applicants randomly  with each receiving $500 worth.,btohqsg

Hi I want to buy iPhone from Harvey Norman coz I like their zero installment policy  but which credit card should I apply for this case? My DBS credit card exceed the cash limit so cannot use anymore.,btohqsg
if you're a miles player  UOB KF   then use with Kris+ 😂,btohqsg
"Note that I dont factor ""sign up rewards""   but more of maximizing what the card will award you on a day-to-day basis..",btohqsg
you trying to commit financial suicide?,btohqsg
Curious also but... i trust u know what u doing la.. 😂,btohqsg
I don’t know what u mean?,btohqsg
oh but if u can wait   can consider buying from Krisshop instead. (You also fulfil the annual $800 requirement on SIA group for 3MPD on selected MCCs),btohqsg
Why not pay off a portion of your spendings and you may use the card again,btohqsg
i think the concern is to not maximize your credit utilization,btohqsg
Zero interest to buy the iPhone  with monthly instalment  every month pay 30 dollar or so  seems like a good financial planning right?,btohqsg
So which credit card can I use as a basic user that I can use instalment to buy my iPhone 😂,btohqsg
if you no concern about miles and other stuff then just these banks  or check in store since this is just for online,btohqsg
If u use bank installment no rewards given anyway so any card no diff,btohqsg
hi guys! can i ask if ntuc vouchers can be counted in citibank premier miles spending? need to hit my min spending,btohqsg
Using Amaze for UOB KF will get 3mpd for offline purchase such as Apple Store? Assume will do $800 SIA purchased later  or only this card for specific mcc?,btohqsg
hi  can I ask for uob stash account  if i put the max 100k for 5% interest  am I able to withdraw the interest every month or that will affect my interest for the month if i withdraw the interest,btohqsg
i think can withdraw  and just keep the $100k there,btohqsg
It is effective 3 percent for 100k,btohqsg
Uob stash is 3 percent for 100k in there  uob one is 5 percent for 100k if u fulfill criteria,btohqsg
instead of UOB Stash  why not UOB FD which is now 3.1%,btohqsg
It depends on when you withdraw.Scenario 1:Interest credited on day 3 and you withdraw on day 4 on previous month. You will have 1 day extra of ADB on previous month. If the interest you earned this month n you withdraw on the same day  your ADB this month will be lower than previous month. You will lost your interest this month.Scenario 2:You withdraw interest earned on the same day or immediately after it is credited every month  no impact on your interest earned.Is my above analysis correct? Can some help to share your experience?,btohqsg
Hope someone can advise on travel insurance.Anyone encounter a scenario that the travel insurance payment is dividing all your itinerary cost by half ?Says the you bought a meal voucher for 2 persons  so insurance only approve claim for one pax. But the voucher was selling in “2 persons” form  there was no single person option to start with 😅 and then how they know i bought a “2 persons” meal voucher is to share the meal  can’t i be eating 2 persons portion ?Feel so weird   the meal voucher showing my name but still dividing my claim by half.Then next time if i traveling alone but i book a 2 pax room  is the travel insurance divide my hotel room cost into 2 ?,btohqsg
thanks  i called uob and they said the same  interest earn on same day and withdraw immediately  no impact on interest earned,btohqsg

I started with DCS Mastercard as it has no minimum spend but I had no lucky getting the annual fee waiver… my cashbacks did not exceed the annual fee so in the end  I lost more than I ‘earned’.If you have the potential to gain cashback exceeding the annual fee or have better luck getting the waiver  this card might be great for you.,btohqsg
But for me  I am sticking with no annual fee cards like CIMB cards or SCB Smart Credit Card so I don’t have to worry every year… but their rewards aren’t that great and CIMB has a minimum spend.,btohqsg
Yup.You can check for comparisons on this website:https://sgfd.neocities.org/,btohqsg
If they dont waive then can just cancel right?,btohqsg
I cancelled but the final bill still charged the annual fee…,btohqsg
How could i sell the tesla fractional shares in moomoo apps?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone use priority pass to access lounge recently?Do u still have to show ur credit card tagged to priority pass account when accessing the lounge? Thanks,btohqsg

Seems like rose's click and unmute isn't doing well :(,btohqsg
For permanent credit limit increase  does the bank give an increase on its own or do we need to request for it? I’ve been requesting and rejected.,btohqsg
need to request for it  subjected to approval,btohqsg
If T- bill matured today  how soon it will reflect in my CPFIS account balance?,btohqsg
Mine was back in dbs by the next business day,btohqsg
Are you sure you need the new phone ? Cos why would you extend spending when one of your card has reached limit. Do you regularly spend until card reach limit ? Do you intend to pay back the monies you owe to the bank ? Are you aware that not paying your bills can affect your credit rating,btohqsg
I pay every month  not minimum sum. I still have 2K credit limit  and as I pay my bills on time ever month  I notice my credit card limit increases.I spent on house appliances for my BTO  and I only have one credit card  that’s why it left 2K credit limit.,btohqsg
Side track abit  credit limit increases if we keep paying full on time over time? I’m trying to increase my own credit limit but always rejected. Lol.,btohqsg
I have applied for SC smart card hehe  so I can give my DBS credit card a break  and let the credit limit increase over time.,btohqsg
If you’re going to use the zero interest installment plan by Harvey Norman  or any installment plan by any merchant  credit card rewards don’t apply to the purchase. Sadly  posted transactions must be a complete transaction.,btohqsg
credit score* perhaps. haven't heard of credit limit increasing by itself outside of credit limit reviews,btohqsg
I get SC smart card so can enjoy 6% cash back  and I can buy my iPhone (by one shot) to get cash back 288 cash back coz I’m new user to SC.,btohqsg
are you not paying the full bill monthly? giving the card a break to wait for limit increases is not a thing,btohqsg
Sorry I mean available limit  not credit limit,btohqsg
only get 6% cashback on very specific merchants yah  and need to accumulate points to redeem cashback,btohqsg
Then what credit card to apply sia.. I was recommended by a friend to apply this SC smart card…no annual fee mah,btohqsg
The 6% cashback covers these specific merchants… and the cashback is given in terms of points.The points must collect until a certain amount then can use.,btohqsg
Hi I have applied for a CIMB cc during the singsaver deal with the PS5 during the 18/11.Till now I have not received my card approval  may I know anyone else aso in this shoe too?,btohqsg
can i subscribe for new tbill with my balance in cpfis account dbsor it must be return back to cpf first? Thanks,btohqsg
FsmOne uses Standard Chartered Bank. Last understood is no fees for transfer to a Standard Charged multicurrency account. For Moomoo  I personally tried transfer from my Dbs multicurrency account  no fees.But transfer of USD from SCB to DBS  it goes through SWIFT (not FAST or PayNow). So there would be handling fees involved.Good to give Fsmone N WeBull a call respectively to confirm if u still keen,btohqsg
"Our consumer credit score would be affected if we are unable to pay or late payment. The score affects our ability to get financing (ie loans   credit cards and leverage).

Hey guys  anyone here been to HK and use Trust Bank Card to withdraw HKD from Hong Kong ATM with no fees? Can share pls? 😊,btohqsg
Paying of bill on time by customer is expected by the bank and our duty. Constant late payments might result in a adverse record in our consumer credit report. Did u try to apply for temporary credit increase for a period of time (if ur use case fit  can Google what use cases can ask) ?,btohqsg
Hi  any recommended credit card to get for my oncoming bulk appliances and furniture purchase for new house?,btohqsg
I applied too. So far only received application confirmation,btohqsg
Payment mode? Over the counter  online  FavePay or?,btohqsg
Actually looking at Gain city or Harvey Norman 😅,btohqsg
Ok. Please use FavePay for both and your linked payment card should be a non DBS card that has higher miles per dollar or cashback,btohqsg
She just needs to watch Chris' video on why she will never retire. 😅https://youtu.be/ciXiTjVVt8A?si=z3OF0IDe7uRMmQVa,btohqsg
If everyone pay full on time.. credit card will give less perks also. Tks to these ppl also,btohqsg
? Maybe just want to maximise usage of cash flow. Not necessary bad habit of expenses.,btohqsg
Not wrong but if everything on installments. U miss out on the credit card perks/rewards etc. pros and cons bah,btohqsg
Higher chance of miscalculation and overspend also cuz all the few ks items suddenly become “cheap” 40-50 dollars monthly payment,btohqsg
No. If you bought with credit card that can with rewards  you can effectively get discount range from 7% to 18%.Can you imagine if you put deposit into a bank n the bank gives you 18% interest?,btohqsg
Yup i agreed  no need to judge other ppl lifestyle. Each to its own,btohqsg
Pls enlighten how to get 7 to 18 percent discount? Thank in advance,btohqsg
Maintenance till 26 Nov? But i am unable to spin on 27 Nov  it says all prizes are won.,btohqsg
He probably mean miles. But miles game not for everyone. And lots of ppl overvalued miles too.,btohqsg
Hi  want to ask should i contact ocbc or singsaver if i havent got the gift redemption code ?I assume should be ocbc right ?,btohqsg
This one is 7.5%. The rest you can search it easily.,btohqsg
Campaign are one off not always ,btohqsg
Mine was 5k spend for 150 lol,btohqsg
If u your BTO is up  and need to pay for renovation which need to pay by cash  instalment to buy kitchen appliances no wrong right? Coz not everyone has 100k cash In the bank to pay everything with cash.,btohqsg
looks like 10% bonus to me,btohqsg
How you count 7.5%? I just spent $1500 under this campaign yesterday  should get $150 cash rebate = 10% not 7.5%.,btohqsg
As I say pros and cons. I never say is wrong,btohqsg
Yes  according to SingSaver redemption email you should have received the redemption code between 20-22 November for qualifying applicants,btohqsg
Oic. I use iPhone pro max $1999 as an example. 150/1999 = 7.5%If you bought cheaper iPhone  can get 10%.,btohqsg
I suggest you give them a call if you are free rn  you don’t usually have to wait when calling in the morning,btohqsg
I don't have any credit cards. I opened HSBC EGA and UOB ONE/STASH/LADY accounts to put FDs previously. Not sure what to do with these accounts and I don't know anything about rebates and cashback. So these accounts are just dormant with the minimum balance inside. How can I make full use of them if I don't intend to get credit cards? Thanks,btohqsg
I gave them a call and they told  me that it will take up to the 30th nov to get the code,btohqsg
Ah okay  the redemption form must be submitted by 5 December according to SingSaver,btohqsg
Good financial planning is not to spend unnecessary money on expensive stuff when there are cheaper alternatives,btohqsg

Does anyone have any experience using Kris+&UOB ladies to pay EU holidays? Did you get the bonus UNI$?,btohqsg
You do not need to justify to anyone how you spend your money. I have 2 perfectly functioning mobile phones a Pixel 7 and iPhone 15 Pro all paid full price btw. People should just mind their own business,btohqsg
what you could do  if nobody replies you (sorry i don't know too) is to ask EU holidays to let u pay $10 with Kris+ first..Then you immediately live chat with UOB CSO to confirm if MCC is 4722  then make the mega payment.,btohqsg
Some are helping to give advice but that sugar daddy remark was uncalled for  should be given warning,btohqsg
Mcc different and only get based point  just pay directly with uob lady,btohqsg
Agree. Or outright banned. That is downright sexual harassment and certainly unsolicited “advice”,btohqsg
call them. I also didn’t receive SMS. they need to check ur eligibility and their product manager. I called them on 22 Nov  they called me back ytd on 27 Nov. Now waiting for them to send the reward SMS.,btohqsg
"I have deleted all the unnecessary comments regarding ""sugar"".We are all adults here  no need to resort to name-calling just because someone's financial lifestyle does not match yours.Also  we are a gender diverse group  so do not past such sexist remarks which makes other people feel uncomfortable or even insulted.I entrust my admins to moderate the chat on my behalf.

Money/credit is just a means to an end. So you scrimp and save for 50 years till retirement  you also do a thorough needs analysis whenever you are required to spend 10 cents over budget. You are going to lead a miserable life and your partner (if you can find one) would probably distance themselves from you. My father is one such person and I can tell you his wife is miserable every day.,btohqsg
Just use your money to buy things you value. And no one can tell you what value is. Some people value experiences (vacation) some value electronic gadgets  some value being pampered (hair salon  spas  etc). And some people just like seeing their money grow so they buy financial products. But there is no wrong way to spend your money. You do you  don’t let others tell you otherwise! 👍,btohqsg
Sorry just one more qns for the moneybull sign up promo. Do I need to convert my SGD to USD to fulfill the 3k USD equivalent?,btohqsg
No worries your father thanks you too 👍,btohqsg
I didn’t try temporary because I want it to be permanent. 😅,btohqsg
Same. After around 2 weeks  I called them and they told me that I wasn’t successful. Lol.You can enquire your status with them. CIMB customer service damn nice and fast.,btohqsg
Any reason your application is failed? Mind to share with us?,btohqsg
I asked for a reason  but they cannot disclose it. They did suggest to build up or maintain my credit score and try again in 6 months interval.,btohqsg
So far  CIMB  HSBC and Citibank rejected me. UOB  SCB and Trust Bank gives me damn low credit limit. DCS gives me a reasonable credit limit.UOB  to me  is the hardest when trying to cancel card.,btohqsg
I just called and they mentioned usually application will only take 3 working days but mine still in processing,btohqsg
Then  don’t lose hope yet… I think they are overwhelmed with a huge amount of people applying.Happened to me when I opened a savings account with them  almost a month of processing to activate the account and that is after I called and asked them to expedite.,btohqsg
Better yet buy the iPhone using credit card in HK and save on GST plus get miles or cash rebate. I bought my iPhone 15 there too,btohqsg
Buy at istudio when fly off get tax free plus cc benefit haha. Just need to contact them to get the model inside the terminal that u fly out,btohqsg
Istudio don’t have all the models like pro max 1TB,btohqsg
Haha that why i say contact them before fly off to get stock u want in. Not all will get 1 TB bah plus can get point on changi reward app,btohqsg
HK is dual physical sim card right.. cannot support esim?i did the maths.. what was your number for u to conclude buying in HK is worth it (i think it was like $50 cheaper based on my maths),btohqsg
remember in singapore  you can earn more miles and rewards especially if you buy at challenger can use kris+ or buy at krisshop,btohqsg
Istudio also have kris + and no forex fee😁,btohqsg
"I have question regarding UOB visa signature 🤔 On terms and condition  they state:""You will earn UNI$1 per S$5 spend on SimplyGo (ABT) based on the accumulated spendon SimplyGo (ABT) Transactions per calendar month and awarded to you on the 7thcalendar day of the following month.""and thereafter""With effect from 1 March 2022  UNI$ will no longer be awarded for transactions withtransaction descriptions “TRANSIT*” and “AMAZE* TRANSIT*”.""So... does simplygo transactions still earn Uni$? bc if they did not remove the former clause 🤔🤔",btohqsg
Simplygo does not fall unde transit i think  seperate description. Transit usually mean top up on ezlink card,btohqsg
ooh  so I still can use for simply go and clock uni$ right? ☺️,btohqsg
Yes but visa signature need 1k to get 4mpd reward  there are better card for simply go,btohqsg
Yes that is plus point for me since I have a Chinese sim,btohqsg
Many cards have low to no forex fees just look at Chris lobangs,btohqsg
But iphone warranty is country base not worldwide,btohqsg
Nope iPhone warranty is worldwide  buy iPhone in Singapore can be replace in other country other than Hong Kong cause it is dual sim,btohqsg
So buy hk iphone any issued can repair in sg?,btohqsg
I just saw got $300 cdc voucher which will expire end of this year. Is there an effective way to spend them on shot.,btohqsg
Actually yes u can  unless it is due to cellular issues or u purchase apple care plus in Hong Kong,btohqsg
So there is restriction also wah lol,btohqsg
But if u purchase in Singapore go Hong Kong cannot service idk y  probably due to the Hong Kong laws  sg Apple not that strict,btohqsg
If it is screen  charging port  battery everything can be repair lah  if it is cellular than cannot,btohqsg
It is still cover under Apple limited warranty other than the cellular,btohqsg
150 use for grocery  150 u can go neighbour hood store to see what u need to get stock up item u usually use,btohqsg
Ya cellular is the reason why i say warranty issue. To get replacement very mafan,btohqsg
But they can help u ship it back to Hong Kong Apple for replacement or repair :),btohqsg
Depends on the staff want to help u or not lol,btohqsg
But I think UOB Visa Signature doesn’t award 4mpd for Simplygo (assuming the 1k criteria is fulfilled),btohqsg
For mine before HomePod was released in sg my HomePod got issues went to Apple sg they help me ship back for replacement just that need like few weeks,btohqsg
thank you! do you recommend any card for simplygo?,btohqsg
yes dont have  they only issue uni$1 for every $5 😭,btohqsg
Sorry i think is sc smart  6 percent cashback no minimum spend,btohqsg
Yeah in ML chat I asked the question about kris+ and krisshop bonus. I’m unsure. But all these add up. Don’t think hk much cheaper,btohqsg
Buy in hk for dual sim. Not for price I feel,btohqsg
Bascially for no forex fee card (no cc rebate or low rebate)   use cc pay the 2- 3.5 percent fee to get cc rebate  all in all i think sg still better  just need to buy at the right time,btohqsg
HK I paid lower than 128G 15 pro price for 256G since I got good exchange rate,btohqsg
But i went to HK for business and transit to CN so is on the way. Not worth flying there to just buy an iPhone,btohqsg
Japan iPhones are cheaper too  plus yen is low,btohqsg
I actually Worked out japan too. Only save $120 and run the risk of get caught for gst and potential japan camera beeping sounds.Please don’t get me wrong. I am saying all this to see what I missed out since I don’t feel japan or hk iPhones are worth buying compared to buying in Singapore and stacking sg offers.,btohqsg
hmm Japan camera sound can be turned off. It’s Geo-bounded,btohqsg
Any creditcard recommendations that gives decent cashback n points for people who spend on travel and  online international shoppings?,btohqsg
Yes the shutter sound yes. But a trusted pro tested it out and there is still a beep beep sound when u press photos very quickly.,btohqsg
Oo ok too many perverts in Japan 😹,btohqsg
Really? I use my iPhone bought in Japan and there’s still sounds though,btohqsg
I agree with u. I’m exploring this angle. Pity I missed the kris shop black Friday double miles.,btohqsg
Shud be more than $120 savings la. 124800 yen at exchange rate of 110  plus 10% tax refund and sometimes the stores like DONKI give 5% extra to foreigners with coupon code  should be a lot below sgd$1299 for iPhone 15 128gb,btohqsg
Just start using the iPhone in Japan don’t think customs will go charge u gst,btohqsg
just nice within 1k limit for amaze+crmc 😹,btohqsg
Hi  if i link uob one card to samsung pay  and use samsung pay for public transport. Is this considered eligible spending for uob one card?,btohqsg

Hi. Already 50 but not wise about investing for retirement.. appreciate information on how to buy etf  s&p  and us stocks in Singapore. Many thanks🙏🏻😊,btohqsg
I think… I’ll wait out until my score is AA and my previous enquiries to clean up over time then try again. Maybe the combined credit limit is too high compared to my income so cannot be approved?,btohqsg

Hence my conclusion it is not worth it to buy in Hong Kong.Welcome any comments / critique. Thanks.,btohqsg
Its worth it if i need dual sim i guess,btohqsg
Like I said I don’t recommend anyone to go HK just to buy an iPhone. But since I was already in HK I thought the pros of a dual sim phone outweighs the cons so I just sprang for it,btohqsg
Hey guys  anyone here tried using Alipay and WeChat Pay (Weixin) in Hong Kong? I installed both but can't verify in Singapore.. Appreciate any comments 😊,btohqsg
What about buy Apple Watch SE in Hong Kong vs Singapore ? 😊,btohqsg
HK accepts intl credit card. You cant verify foreign cards only local CN bank cards,btohqsg
yeah dual sim make sense to buy a HK set..i am actually not targetting u don't get me wrong.it was actually way before you  many people keep saying go HK or JP must buy Iphone.. i don't get why,btohqsg
I don’t see the value in Apple Watch I’m considering a garmin instead,btohqsg
i keep FOMOing if i forget to factor in something.. why i keep calculate like not worth it,btohqsg

From what I know Alipay (maybe WeChat pay too) does not have SG wallet (correct me if I’m wrong) so the China wallet I don’t think accepted in HK. But you can link you Visa and MC to still use Alipay as a payment method though I fail to see why you don’t just use the CC directly,btohqsg
There is even a supermarket in SZ that only accepts HK/Macau wallet Alipay for payment and not China Alipay,btohqsg
hi guys! can i ask if ntuc vouchers can be counted in stanchart simply cash cc? need to hit my min spending,btohqsg
Yes no SG wallet for both Alipay and WeChat pay . From what I know  the Singapore issued credit or debit card linked to the platforms can be used for payment. I have verified with Alipay chat online. Personally  didn't tried. For HK  I can't find anything on Google. Thanks so much for replying with your comments,btohqsg
ok to pay at the service counter right?,btohqsg
There are so many things more worth buying in JP like a PS5 or exclusive collectibles. But must be careful since some of their Sony DAP (ZX707) are volume limited so no one wants one.,btohqsg
Their payment is damn confusing. Like i was downright shocked that a SZ business don’t accept digital payment from Alipay CN wallet but that is China for you,btohqsg
Precisely your Sz is Suzhou or Shenzhen?,btohqsg
For the SC save up level up program  did anyone get a reply from SC telling you that you are among the first 1 500 people signed up for that?,btohqsg
Shenzhen. Oh and btw SG linked CC unless you have unionpay won’t be accepted in most retailers in CN. In case you are thinking of using that there. I speak from experience,btohqsg
I have ICBC Singapore issued Union Pay. I would link it to both platforms since u say so 😊,btohqsg
I have ICBC China debit card too. But I can’t figure out why the ICBC SG account can’t transfer to ICBC CN. I suspect it is CNY currency control issue,btohqsg
Have u tried using Alipay and WeChat pay in China linked to a Singapore issued credit or debit card before?,btohqsg
Yes but Visa MC limited acceptance all public services (HSR  coaches  metro  etc) won’t accept it but unionpay should be ok. Only intl 4/5 * hotels and some high end restaurants accept Visa and MC unfortunately.,btohqsg
Just to clarify  from what u wrote the card that is linked to the platform matters. From what I read online  seem to be otherwise 😂,btohqsg

Licensed also dont mean cant go wrong. 13.5 return is obviously as high risk.,btohqsg
Applied and got approved for Citi cashback+ MC before.,btohqsg
It's to help fact check the part where you doubted the legality and mas regulated. And they didn't say 13.5% return  only up to. Nowhere said guaranteed also.,btohqsg
Mas liscense and mas regulated is 2 different thing,btohqsg
U can apply for a license to be on mas site as long as u fulfill the criteria and what license it is approved under is not what common people will go check. So using such wording east to attract ppl to jump onboard. How many ppl will bother to go check the company inside out,btohqsg
Look how china peer to peer lending crash,btohqsg
