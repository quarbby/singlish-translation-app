7 years mah. 2.8% pa right?,btohqsg
the way they count interest on car loan is this ,btohqsg
2.88% per year x 7 years = 20.16% interest on the principal,btohqsg
if you put the money in UOB 5% for example u get S$31 500 of interest in that 7 years  wont u earn the difference?,btohqsg
eh u drive E class u dunno meh,btohqsg
ya car loan is not worth it one  always try not to extend loan,btohqsg
coe loan la once in 10 years,btohqsg
if u got 90k why would u pay full coe now if u can take up a 2.88% pa loan for the 90k and put that 90k into UOB 5% instead?,btohqsg
good idea also  but remember once u sign on the loan  the 18k interest u got to pay even if u early pay off the loan,btohqsg
what is the rate for a shorter tenor?,btohqsg
should be same. They say its the lowest in whole industry hmm,btohqsg
same  if 2 years loan is 2.88 x 2 = approx 6%,btohqsg
bro is the same as housing loan right? 2.88% pa,btohqsg
not same housing loan is based on declining balance,btohqsg
method of computation of interest payable is not same,btohqsg
so for this the principal will be fixed for the whole 7 years?,btohqsg
car loan the interest is added on to principal and stuck for duration of loan,btohqsg
housing loan  if u pay off principal  the interest payable will decrease over time,btohqsg
if u check your bank loan statement  you will see your interest payable for housing loan will decrease monthly,btohqsg
Amaze doesn‚Äôt work? Tot it should work when use Fairprice app to pay at kopitiam?,btohqsg

Does dbs live fresh give cashback for telco payments?,btohqsg
yes if telco mcc and via online/contactless,btohqsg
Meaning cannot be set as recurring?,btohqsg
Wa Zhun bo? Not doubting but srsly it does not fall under bill payment and excluded (I know it says excluded from minimum spend but by extension cashback)?So like that the cashback for DBS Live Fresh (5%) better than those cards that actly give cashback for telco specifically like OCBC 365. Then I better stop using these alrd,btohqsg
No need be too excited telco is small part of expenditure,btohqsg
paying telco via telco app/website is not bill payment via internet banking. Tried and tested to get cashback for many years already.btw uob one where got specifically give cashback for telco?,btohqsg
Mmm  by extension  utilities bills also get cashback from ‚Äúonline spend‚Äù by paying online? Okay thank youHaha quite substantial for mine leh - telco + utilities and also OCBC 365 minimum spend is quite high ($800). If this is rly true  might as well use DBS live fresh**sry I no use UOB but read/heard somewhere that 1 of the UOB card recommended for utilities and telco de? Or maybe utilities only not sure. But I using OCBC 365 and it covers cashback for both utilities and telco recurring,btohqsg
