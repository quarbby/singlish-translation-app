the only one source     all been closed for the past many months !!,btohqsg
Wonder how this ktv cluster will be,btohqsg
maybe 1 of their staff visit KTV or eat satay at TPY.....,btohqsg
or wait it is going up so probably not,btohqsg
4 women - handle different time slot for one day around 20 person per women  equal 80 person  then  multiple by 14 days -> equal to 1120    then back home another x4  around 4500 !!,btohqsg
How the police dealing with the Ktv operators ?,btohqsg
Just punish the figure head or the entire management,btohqsg
sold yesterday    119 recent high might not able to hold  will formed a false break !!,btohqsg
This guy should have told the Newspaper that he did not go to the KTV. It was the ladies working in the KTVs coming to the Satay Stall and patronised from him and this is how he kena Covid 19. Haha!!,btohqsg
Just give you guys a headcount how bad the KTV cluster is. If the hostess can entertain 10 male patrons per night and her symptoms show up 12 days later  can imagine how bad the situation is or not.,btohqsg
just read the hourly chart on yesterday afternoon  MACD cutting down  stop some loss la !! But i might be wrong if 119 can hold !! DYODD,btohqsg
OMG. multiply that with the numbers of hostess. OYK will have his head cracked.,btohqsg
And OYK still allow 5 ppl dine in..,btohqsg
I’m ok if OYK revert back to 2 ppl dine in. Lesser exposure,btohqsg
Our Malay community then sad  everytime hari Raya coming some shot happened,btohqsg
I have to agree with them to a certain extent,btohqsg
Well if go back to 2 again confirm a lot of FnB bosses unhappy,btohqsg
Those tiko-pek who La-Ji (french kiss) with these hostess will potentially have their tongue look like this....I think AIDS is more scary than Covid...But sabo the covid numbers = a nation umbrage ...,btohqsg
OYK is really a jinx. Everything he touches  sure something bad happened.,btohqsg
Your Afternoon Quick Read – 15 July 2021The cool guy is hereUncle Powell displayed his usual calming presence despite two-day hot inflation numbers. As expected  he deflected inflation concerns as temporary pressures and reiterated his stance to keep the current policies in place until there is “substantial further progress”.Re-opening of the economyThe intense debate can be seen in Congress over the nature of inflation despite Powell’s assurance. However  he did mention that while the longer-term inflation expectations have moved north. they are still “broadly consistent with the FOMC’s longer-run inflation goal”.Russell 2000 takes a big hitMarkets take comfort in his words after a choppy trading early session. The three major indices were relatively flat  while Pika World’s favourite Russell 2000 had an outsized reaction.The Russell 2000 is considered a bellwether index of the US economy due to its focus on smaller companies. However  its bigger brother is often referred to as S&P 500  which covers large-cap stocks.For investors  Russell 2000 is helpful as an investment opportunity since it encompasses a broad-based representation of the entire market than an otherwise narrower index that could have more bias towards stock-specific risk.Within the Russell 2000  you can also see sub-categories. For example  the Russell 2000 Value Index is helpful to track companies with lower Price-to-Book ratios. This indicator reveals the market price of the company in relation to its balance sheet. On the other hand  the Russell 2000 Growth Index focuses on a group of companies with higher Price-to-Book ratios  or simply those with high growth potential in the future.As growth appears peaking  the worry of tapering and Covid variants suggests that growth is likely to moderate. This could put pressure on Russell 2000 Index and Pika Nat’s portfolio in this shift.The road aheadUncle Powell provides some update to the Congress that is critical to put into our political diary dates. First  he stated that there is likely to be further discussion on the tapering talk during the Fed’s meeting on July 27-28  where we can have more visibility on the timeline.Until then  Pika World is in mild accumulation mode  given that Pika Nat’s portfolio has seen a moderation in this mid-cycle transition. The ride will become more volatile as the dust of uncertainty settles on new ground.Cheers  Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will be a great motivation to us.,btohqsg

I think is not targetted at Malay community lah. Is applicable to any community that if they don’t understand n cooperate why the restrictions then will balloon out of control like in Malaysia  Indonesia n India. That was how n why the numbers spiked,btohqsg

SGXStocks/Sectors to Watch Out:Fortress MineralsThe company reported a record revenue of USD17.3 million for the first quarter ended May 31  nearly 2.5 times the USD7.1 million figure and net profits of USD7.2 million  which is more than 3 times the USD2.2 million made for the same period prior year. The company attributed the jump in earnings to increased sales volume and strong iron ore prices.
