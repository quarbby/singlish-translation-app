Hi I consolidated this list of REITS from videos I watched from various YouTuber. Which REITS should I buy?,btohqsg
anyone knows if you put 100k in new UOB Stash account on 1 Jul  do you get 5% for the month of Jul  or only for the next month? since the criteria is you need to maintain or increase the amount? or I should quickly open this month and start deposit next month?,btohqsg
I think no matter what  you wonâ€™t get 5% from stash because the effective rate is not 5%,btohqsg
do i get it on the month I open or the following month?,btohqsg
I think it does not matter because if you maintain the same  u still get 3% per year. It is not based on incremental balance.The interest = $100k x 3% x (31/365) for Jul.,btohqsg
