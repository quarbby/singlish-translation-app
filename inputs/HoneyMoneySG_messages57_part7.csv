Hi for citibank rewards card how much needed to spend to waive off the fee?,btohqsg
If you can book in two different batches  using UOB Solitaire1). Book $3k in 1st batch on 27th or before of a calendar month2). Book $3k in 2nd batch on or after 01 of next calendar month.3). $1k can be booked on any calendar month using your 2nd 4mpd card.Expected miles earned: ($1k x 4mpd )+ ($3k x 2 x 6mpd) = 40 000 miles.,btohqsg
Hi guys May I check if payment via XNAP app for hawker food using DBS WWMC  does it qualify as an online transaction for rewards?,btohqsg
If cannot split  then best card is UOB krisflyer where you can earn 3mpd provided you can clock $800 annual spend on SIA  Scoot or Krisshop.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if ebay purchase is eligible for HSBC revolution?,btohqsg

Thank for reply. Even when using Apple Pay?,btohqsg
Don't know about apple pay but Google pay works,btohqsg
No explicit amt stated by Citi  though from experience  as long as there's spending transactions on the card  it's relatively straight forward to call in for a AF waiver....,btohqsg
Any miles credit card reco for utilities?,btohqsg
Is this sms registration a one time or monthly?,btohqsg
Anyone knows If I pay for my dental using Citi rewards VISA card via contact less payment (or paywave)  will I be able to earn 4MPD?,btohqsg
Only base point of 0.4mpd i think,btohqsg
If I use amaze + CRMC?,btohqsg
Can use ocbc titanium with ShopBack and get 10 points?,btohqsg
Amaze only work with mastercard version,btohqsg
If the dental is paid for via HealthHub for polyclinics MC8099 then can 4MPD for CRMC+ amazeIf MC under typical dental 8012 (I think) then no excluded from 4MPD. Try AMEX TCB if they accept Amex,btohqsg
yes get 4mpd so long not excluded mcc like govt services,btohqsg
Anyone having issue with Citibank online banking? I login and was trying to  check my rewards points crediting but stuck at this page. Tried using safari and chrome on MacBook,btohqsg
Dear all any one knows wtr I can still get 6 miles if I selector dining option for UOB ladyâ€™s  card and used kris+ app to pay (using UOB ladyâ€™s master card ) ??,btohqsg
don't click on the shortcut...click on the REWARDS TAB..,btohqsg
If the mcc fall under dining as stated on uob lady term and condition then u will get 6 mpd,btohqsg
Just wondering what time do they normally credit the 3.48 interest for gxs,btohqsg
Hi gurus quick check  is lump sum payment for restaurant wedding dinner considered to be a supported payment by Citi Payall? MCC code is Dining. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
no lah  can just use credit card directly,btohqsg
Thanks. I was wondering if it's worth it to get Citi Payall since they're running a promo of 2.2mpd for fee of 2.2% now. Will this be better than the usual 1.2mpd?,btohqsg
no  1 mile worth less than 2.2 cents. And you can actually get 4mpd-6mpd using some cards,btohqsg
Will you be able to share how the calculations for this? Sorry my maths is not that good ðŸ˜…. Context is that the restaurant is rushing for payment and we only have a few 4-6mpd cards  so the remaining amount might have to be paid with Citi Premiermiles,btohqsg
even 1.2mpd is better than citi payall.  Max out your 4mpd-6mpd cards first  the rest see which card give best rewards  1.2mpd is already the best?,btohqsg
I see ok thanks  will not go for Citi Payall then. Will definitely maximise our 4-6mpd cards  hopefully our 1.4mpd card comes in time!,btohqsg
Actually for Payall now  isnâ€™t the purchase rate at 1 mile to 1cent? Not 1 mile to 2.2 cents?,btohqsg
Actually how much is the payment?With UOB VS PPV ladyâ€™s/solitaireYou can already get $4000 to $6000 worth of spending at 4-6mpd.There are two types of people mainly  (1) those that get miles only through credit card spends (2) And those that are willing to pay to earn miles (e.g. citipayall)Which are you? If you are (2)  how much do you value a mile? If you can get it cheaper than what you value  then go for it,btohqsg
Anyone using the ipaymy and cardup to pay for rental fee? Which platform better?,btohqsg
Hi  if i have a supplementary card holder for citibank  am I consider new customer if I want to apply for another card in citibank?,btohqsg
Citi payall is 1 cent per mile  not 2.2 cents per mile. But when you use payall  you are effectively buying miles not earning them. So use only if you really need the additional miles. Otherwise even at 1.4mpd  you are earning the miles  not buying them.,btohqsg
They are on promo intil Aug  so 1 dollar = 2.2milea,btohqsg
How did you arrive at 1 dollar = 2.2 miles? Their promo is you pay 2.2% fee and in return gets 2.2mpd  effectively buying miles at 1 cent per mile isn't it?,btohqsg
He means spend $ through payall u get 2.2 miles. He didnt include the charges.,btohqsg
Oic  thanks for highlighting. But the main difference is still with one you are buying miles  and with the other you are earning miles  albeit at a lower rate.,btohqsg
Yes correct. So depends which type of mile collector u are!,btohqsg
Hey Champs If there is no annual fee on CIMBcard  this deal seems to be a no brainer. Plus there are lots of promos on Shopback with CIMB card. So if you can spend $988 within 60 days  I guess this card is good to have  am I correct?,btohqsg
If I am mainly saving miles  then if I just want to own one CIMB card  Visa Signature seems to be the one to have as it provides the highest cashback (10%) on your online spending. Correct?,btohqsg
Dyson fan looks like a better option than $300 cash,btohqsg
Actually no one talk about ez link card but seems like it as some discount and may even be cheaper than using credit card,btohqsg
Uob one acct credit card rebates the quarter is for consecutive 3 months or they follow the calendar (Jan - mar  Apr to jun  etc) ?? The current NDP promo - is it worth it - must deposit the 50k  100k or 200k in one shot or all within the promo period of July to end aug ?? (Must keep it in for 3 months right,btohqsg
Worth it to put 100k if you currently has zero balance,btohqsg
That's because you took morning train with discount  when you tap before 7:45. Not because of using ez link. Using credit card is the same fare,btohqsg
u asking about uob one card quarterly rebate? You have a specific quarter  tied to your statement date and which month your card application was approved.For ndp promo  pls at least read the TnC  answer to your question clearly stated. Note that u still get the 5% interest for $100k monthly savings on top of the promo.,btohqsg
