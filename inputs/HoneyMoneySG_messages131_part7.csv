Thanks a lot for prompt response,btohqsg
anyone can advise.. always hear about Amzze+Citi Rewards  but no one talks about Amze+Ocbc titatium..,btohqsg
hi for moomoo  do we need to have like some finance education before purchasing any funds?,btohqsg
ocbc titanium is now ocbc rewards. Amaze+ocbc rewards can save on fx fees for overseas transactions  but get bonus points only if mcc is under whitelisted list. Some countries have monkey mcc  so sometimes may not get bonus points.,btohqsg
Hi all  can check if its better to get the iphone 16 on krisshop or apple store? Both prices same,btohqsg
In local spent context..is it good for daily use like amze + citi,btohqsg

Krisshop cuz u earn extra KF miles,btohqsg
may I know how much extra is that if im using the UOB kris flyer cc?,btohqsg
Amaze is practically worthless with all the recent nerf. Local purchase don't even earn amaze point,btohqsg
Depends on ur krisshoper status. Lowest tier is 2mpd  excluding tax.,btohqsg
their customer service is atrocious  Slow and poor response,btohqsg
Amaze is on life support with crmc.,btohqsg
better to use the cc by itself.,btohqsg
it took Amaze weeks to reverse charge when it's use for hotel  after multiple emails. I cannot imagine if the card is fraud n charged. Banks are responsive with the scam hotline line,btohqsg
hello. Can anyone help please? üôèüèª,btohqsg
Miles card for public transport I can think of UOB KF. Cab ride can use crmc. Not sure any miles can use for SP.,btohqsg
Hi  I just received Citi Reward MC. When I try to link with Amaze  it failed and say the card issuer has rejected the request. Anyone encountered similar error before and how you resolve this? TIA.,btohqsg
Hello! I've initally intended to use the uob ladies + amaze for overseas trip end of this month. Since that's no longer an option now  what are the other alternatives besides crmc + amaze? Feels like there's nothing solid out there üòï,btohqsg
Just use the card without amaze then,btohqsg
Amaze +Maybank fnfCiti cashbackCrmc (as u mentioned)All still very solid cases.,btohqsg
Hm. Is the 3.25% still worth the 4mpd though? Wondering if youtrip makes better sense,btohqsg
hi  anyone has received the interest for hsbc jun/jul promotion period?,btohqsg
How much do u value ur mile? Then u calc. Imo 4mpd is still ok,btohqsg
If you are sure you will spend S$2000 in oversea from 30 Sep  UOB Lady is still solid and is still the option if you can pair it with Lady account 6mpd.,btohqsg
Buying miles under 1cpm is still ok imo‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Do you think we could borrow this loan and then put it into FD for earn difference in interest?,btohqsg
5.84% interest per year? I don‚Äôt recall any bank give your FD higher than 5.84%.,btohqsg
Where should i park for guaranteed returns? Say around 200k,btohqsg
Guaranteed return for how many % ? For how long? Any other efforts you prepare to do to achieve the higher return?,btohqsg
We can only give general answer to a general question. If you don‚Äôt want to do work to monitor  then throw into FD SSB and t-bills. It gives guaranteed returns and capital protected to some degree,btohqsg
A little late else could have put in ocbc premier üòÖ,btohqsg
150k into UOB one acct and 50k into ssb tbills.,btohqsg
Does uob VS & uob PPV works totally the same (in terms of mcc & payment mode)? I understand VS requires minimum 1k and capped at 2k whereas PPV is capped at 1k,btohqsg
anyone tried buying tele premium via desktop? trying to gift a friend but it keeps giving me an error. hesitant to buy through appstore cause it's more expensive :(,btohqsg
