Iike idklah its unspoken but i can feel it,btohqsg
enter Uni with o not so ideal. u dh a lot of choices,btohqsg
And to make the matters worse theyre so narrow minded,btohqsg
I know people like you. Till the very end they do not have the discipline to grind. In the last 3 months they will be flailing around only to realise its too late but you cant change it its human nature. Only those smart or kiasu enough will even do well. The rest looking with dread and claiming their hardwork failed them yet they never really give their brains time to absorb.,btohqsg
Monarch ah but that one my mother say during her time its a “dumping ground” grades no good js go there,btohqsg
But i rlly dk whats not giving me the drive,btohqsg
Studies have shown that theres no such thing as talent,btohqsg
without uni your responsibilities plateau very early lor,btohqsg
some overseas offer full coverage scholarships if u just pass ur o levels so..,btohqsg
One thing was shared among all successfull individuals they spent 10k hours at what they were doing. There was not a single person who rose to the top with just talent not even one,btohqsg
i rmb a reddit post..someone asked whether after failing their n levels can go overseas anot to continue studying,btohqsg
I love this chat grp man,btohqsg
the more important concept is that talent only gets you so far,btohqsg
so unless you can spend 2k hours studying in last 3 months,btohqsg
ehh for the unis i saw only o lvl then can,btohqsg
