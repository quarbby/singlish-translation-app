some man act as woman > creates a ‚Äòsafe space for girls only‚Äô > give girls gl to clubs > actually isnt supersonic‚Äôs gl but third party > turns out to be a predator that keeps asking girls to make out,btohqsg
okay guys all things aside  i didn‚Äôt really expect things to blow up this big today because like i said i thought it only happened to a handful of girls and the least i could do is to warn everyone out there that they might potentially run into a guy like him. I wasn‚Äôt brave enough to say his name because i was afraid he might do something to me. So thank you@migueland@limmyfor voicing out.I‚Äôm glad that we managed to prevent rohit today from preying on more girls  and i‚Äôm really sorry to all the victims who were personally harassed by him. i hope you‚Äôre doing great and if you ever need someone to confide in you can always talk to me!its crazy how many people were involved in this and im glad that the clubs have taken measures üëåüèª Please stay safe in the club and do feel free to send more evidence if you want! If you guys ever need GL  do look for the credible telegram groups in the pinned messages.FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOST:‚Ä¢Rohit tiwari  telegram id:@Panniegirl@roroor smth - has multiple telegram accounts which are all the same person‚Ä¢ Evidence against him for harassing girls  asking them to makeout  guilt tripping them for not wanting to. Asked girls to send nudes  spreaded personal content (telebubbles)   collected personal information from clubbers when he doesnt not work in the club. Claimed that he works/are friends with the DJs but is not.‚Ä¢ touched girls provocatively‚Ä¢ kept asking to make out in exchange for GL‚Ä¢ ok theres more but this message is getting too longUltimately hes the worst for making a ‚Äúsafe space‚Äù for women and lying about it. He was in fact one of the biggest threat to women  and has broken our trust by lying about almost everything.,btohqsg

Sakura sakuranoyama mo sato momi-watasu kagiri,btohqsg
to be fair  Korea does tend to be quite protectionistic...,btohqsg
?? I stocked Fruits before in NTUC and Strawberries are not Korea oni off the top of my head USA was regular too,btohqsg
Heck even Australian Strawberries were stocked,btohqsg
Driscolls are nice tho albeit very sweet,btohqsg
Then again its depend on taste and preference,btohqsg
my palate to used to jap and korea strawberries alr,btohqsg
Quite ex tho usually higher priced,btohqsg
Its sweeter than the jap and korea ones,btohqsg
Australias one is just cheaper and not that good,btohqsg
But we still stocked a ton of em,btohqsg
The allstate farms one is the ones NTUC usually stock,btohqsg
is it just me  or are there surprisingly few voice acting courses in SG?,btohqsg

@Polarbearnextdoorflorals wants me to send the pic to you,btohqsg
don't tell me that rae is up to something,btohqsg
rae is banned on disc and shes no longer here,btohqsg
she ghosted this chat the moment she got called out,btohqsg
she told me she got found out on disc  thn she came here and got found out again,btohqsg
"bro just said ""adios"" and left",btohqsg
shld i block her on ig,btohqsg
wanna be an asshole  too much of a coward to either stand her ground or admit her mistake,btohqsg
shld ban her frm rp chat ngl,btohqsg
why is bro in the rp chat grp?,btohqsg
ngl if that person is her again  it just further proves we didn't call her out harshly enough,btohqsg
oh btw i didnt text her,btohqsg
she's gonna be the next chan ric in uni,btohqsg
cuz if i did  i wld text 1 peel para and zhao,btohqsg
ya i shld just block her from ig,btohqsg
wait that bozo mention me and my cjc jokes,btohqsg

josh is busy shitting himself over poly ori tmr,btohqsg
i think matcha is the only sane 07 here,btohqsg
you kena either muted/banned almost everywhere,btohqsg

some jc ppl thought I was sec 3,btohqsg
Bro u born during AFC siol,btohqsg
Chat how do u reject someone,btohqsg
guys is a expertbook worth it for poly?,btohqsg
Is Rae admitting she was the person in the screenshot kuro sent?,btohqsg
this was b4 she got found out on tele,btohqsg
I thought earlier we couldn‚Äôt confirm it‚Äôs her because the handle was hidden,btohqsg
Name was different too  so if it was her it was a burner account,btohqsg
But I don‚Äôt get if Rae was talking about the messages sent to florals,btohqsg
Let me try to find the screenshot kuro sent,btohqsg
i mean she only said she shittalked the dc ppl,btohqsg
but we don't know if she shittalked the tele ppl like rose,btohqsg
Oh ya then before that she couldn‚Äôt have found out florals tele I guess?,btohqsg
rae cld be using burner acct,btohqsg
she could have found out florals tele then dmed her,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I said I was thinking it‚Äôs possible that the person who PMed florals could be a sec sch bully who found out she went to YI,btohqsg
Yeah possibly and if yes using a burner account,btohqsg
y we dl them is another thing,btohqsg
"""lol imagine being in the worst poly in sg!!! lol!! can't make it to ejc = failures in life!!! womp womp!!!""",btohqsg
oh yea no not that kind of trolling,btohqsg
Look  I appreciate your bravery for confessing your love towards me and I know the feeling you are looking for  but I am just not feeling it here in my heart. I hope you can respect my decision and I know what is best for me.,btohqsg
Too complicated bro their brain cannot comprehend,btohqsg
So do you think she was referring to those msgs,btohqsg
relationship wise? or a task wise,btohqsg
ok tru rae is another level alr,btohqsg
Then not for u to answer,btohqsg
haha nice one add fuel to fire,btohqsg
"bro really called yijc ""elitist"" just because they booed mi during nsg",btohqsg
nah just saying you bold..nothing wrong mah,btohqsg
OUT OF EVERYTHING YOU SAY YIJC üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
small thing lah  why have to fight back?,btohqsg
they aren't acs boys you know!! they are gangsters!!,btohqsg
hmm yea cld be rae send tht to rose thn got found out  but then im not on the disc  so idk wheter she shittalk ppl on the chat itself or she dm them,btohqsg
"why did they call mi ""L1R4"" tho üíÄüíÄüíÄ",btohqsg
you think i know that he will say r/s meh..cannot ask ah,btohqsg
Oh ic. Anyway Rae got those msgs on tele so if it rly is her then she must have gotten floral‚Äôs tele handle somehow and used a burner account. But I rly wonder if she would‚Äôve gone to such an extent tbf if she didn‚Äôt even know florals well,btohqsg
"never heard of the term ""clarification""?",btohqsg
tbf florals ranted on here about her probs when rae was still here,btohqsg
sorry ah  but you dont belong in my fam tree to child me. thanks,btohqsg
cuz they actl tokd me that they lurk in the chat,btohqsg
To make themselves feel better because they have no other JCs they can shit on given that they are the worst. But then they do not realise that they should no do unto others what they don‚Äôt want done upon them,btohqsg
so they know abt me from this chat alone,btohqsg
im a simple person..i dont find trouble..if it comes to me..i run..cause prevention better than cure,btohqsg
bro during nsg basketball match a few weeks back legit,btohqsg
someone go send isilts to me,btohqsg
i suspect my jc classmates doing all these,btohqsg
cuz i currently getting ostracised in class,btohqsg
does it look like i care? honestly,btohqsg
15k messages later..you still dont know me isit,btohqsg
You want to try saving all their contacts?,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs rly one of them,btohqsg
im not doing that i blocked them on social media,btohqsg
tell my bulleis everyth abt me,btohqsg
I mean there‚Äôs no other way I can think of  but this method can prove it‚Äôs from them,btohqsg
then aft that even admitted they lurk in this chat,btohqsg
You can save their contacts then delete later,btohqsg
they may be the ones bullying me in my dms,btohqsg
cuz prev right one of mg bullies,btohqsg
go n send n word in my dms,btohqsg
Unless even they are using a burner account or it‚Äôs not them,btohqsg
reflection on myself?..yall will have a reality check  next time. grow old alr  you see how my gen treat yall. enjoy your next 40 yrs,btohqsg

bro at least rose isn't the only one,btohqsg

I wonder if Jun wei is the oldest,btohqsg
Maybe got some very old gss lurking,btohqsg

the old ranking is like jun wei / ;-; -> me -> kuro for people that are here semi often,btohqsg
you sure..my gen love to lepak ah  idk about your kakis,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why the only way to find out who is to save all their contacts,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs rly from them will show,btohqsg
working? nah by the time i am..ns square will be ready,btohqsg
frozen fruits is good in this weather,btohqsg
they can onlt warn my bullies,btohqsg
Iinw I saw somewhere Timothy is 26,btohqsg
the fact that yijc isn't doing anything to solve bullying is amazing,btohqsg
say they want punch me allat,btohqsg
stupid and irreparable..maybe ive just been putting on a act? maybe not...,btohqsg
but my class the omly class with BME how,btohqsg
call joseph schooling out of retirement and go punch them back,btohqsg
i hate how mobile and desktop doens't have mod feature parity,btohqsg
what if that class also got ppl liddat,btohqsg
You should1) contact the DM and principal2) report to police if nothing is doneIf situation doesn‚Äôt resolve  bullying is a valid reason for transferring schs. Ppl use it as a reason for transferring in Pri or sec sch so I think it should work for JC too,btohqsg
the fact this my actual gpa,btohqsg
every place wikl hsve shit ppl liddat,btohqsg
the dm already knkws abt it,btohqsg
the whole discipline comm knows abt it,btohqsg
Yeah but her case might be like some kind of extenuating circumstances,btohqsg
even want to interview the actual bullie n the ppl,btohqsg
bro is getting death threats üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
mi too fsr from my house,btohqsg
lmao i think they will lie sia,btohqsg
im just speaking what has been on pen and paper  there is nothing wrong. The fact yall keep thinking i have a ulterior motive is mind bloggling,btohqsg
ur friends' flag is redder than my nosebleed bruh,btohqsg
üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
Bs idk the situation but it sounds bad,btohqsg
wah i ssnt tk die siah,btohqsg
Which is why I think honestly should just try to report it and get it resolved asap  if the situation doesn‚Äôt improve the chances of transferring early would be maximised if it‚Äôs requested sooner,btohqsg
Also rmbr about keeping the evidence,btohqsg
BRO UK THE SCHOOL SAY I GOT NO EVIDENCE,btohqsg
you dont understand that term enough to use it..im just selective,btohqsg
u tjink i lying is it,btohqsg
at this rate  they gonna investigate untill ur a levels bruh,btohqsg
Bro no matter what u say theres nothing u can say that wont just dig your grave even more,btohqsg
not the first time  wont be the last. i dont care the grave im digging...i just want to spread information. is it that hard to understand. if its wrong so be it,btohqsg
like that don't even need to investigate alr,btohqsg
js idk shut up  go stand in a corner and reflect on ur actions,btohqsg
meanwhile ppl throw trash onto the floor:police: ARRRESTED AND SENT TO LIFETIME IMPRISONMENT,btohqsg
Oh crap might have no choice but to report to the police. Those chers at yi might seriously not give a shit about bullying and can‚Äôt take their job seriously,btohqsg
U know of the term stop hitting yourself? Yeah that's the information you need,btohqsg
yall dont find value  others will..ive been on the internet too long to know what works and what dont,btohqsg
uk right i even told thrm,btohqsg
@chemcer@POLARBEARNEXTDOORIM ACTUALLY 10 DAYS FROM SUB 200,btohqsg
i think the chers didn't have a choice to move to yi or else they wouldn't be there üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
yea ig thts what kuro means about not giving a shit bout bullying,btohqsg
Hi. I was watching videos of trains in Japan to try to relive my memories,btohqsg
let me ask you a question..have i posted anything here that has affected your life,btohqsg
Shouldn‚Äôt bullying be like punishable by corporate punishment,btohqsg
Oh then what does sub 200 mean,btohqsg
they cannot even get in house suspension,btohqsg
yall literally dont understand that term..stop using it,btohqsg
It hasnt but like the idiot that keeps running into a lampost I don't feel the pain but I sure as shit wish for a lampost without someone running into it,btohqsg
my ord date  less than 200 days to it,btohqsg
I saw this lol  India is not for beginners,btohqsg
YASSS I ATE GURL!!!!!!! SLAYYYYYY üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
nah it does not phase me  it could be a trigger word for somebody else tho,btohqsg
eh this i agree  i nearly died riding one lol,btohqsg
Wow you went to India before,btohqsg
worse than when i was in sec sch,btohqsg
I saw the videos of ppl riding on the train roof,btohqsg
hell no  that disgrace of a human being live 4 decades alr still acting like a animal,btohqsg
Like the train is so packed,btohqsg
n i taking a levels somemore,btohqsg
Oops my bad  thought you were of Chinese ethnicity,btohqsg
my class only class woth 3h2 bme,btohqsg
just pon sch if they don't allow you to leave bruh,btohqsg
yah can but i need change combi,btohqsg
dk sia maybe june or smth,btohqsg
why can't u reapply for BCMh,btohqsg
i nvr get a2 for comb sci,btohqsg
but unlikely i gg back oso,btohqsg
if they cant do anyth to the bullies you can do something to get urself suspended  then just study at home until A lvls,btohqsg
wah this will go to perm record,btohqsg
I watch drew binsky‚Äôs videos and he said he got food poisoning there many times,btohqsg
He said it‚Äôs called Delhi belly,btohqsg
The locals must have a super strong stomach,btohqsg
how abt switching E to h1,btohqsg
take their worksheets out of the class stack and keep them in your bag/throw them away,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need to get suspended  can just request to drop out,btohqsg
not an available combi this yr,btohqsg
but like that she cant take her As for free,btohqsg
better than getting a burned mark on your record,btohqsg
Like at first I thought kuro wasn‚Äôt joking when he said he was your twin,btohqsg
BRO I SAID I CANT DO H2 DOIBLE SCI,btohqsg
Oh ya. Then maybe request to take a gap year,btohqsg
Come back as a J1 next year,btohqsg
no im actually not his twin but  im also an NSF who is a fat combat medic,btohqsg
correct me if im wrong but the only times when the sch/moe does smtg about bullying is when the child get srsly injured ot they commit s*cide,btohqsg
then you prob have to change either bio or econs lor,btohqsg
then the bully j2 will bully somemore,btohqsg
can influence j1 to bully her,btohqsg
I figured out it was a joke when you said you in ns but kuro wasn‚Äôt,btohqsg
"yea.. i know ""think before you speak"" heard like a gazillion times",btohqsg
yah lor this whole sch alr knows abt this,btohqsg
idk how many times ppl commit su*cide but moe really did nothing useful,btohqsg
Bro this ain't chess they don't fucking think,btohqsg
they legit asked my ex friends to harte me,btohqsg
YA THATS WHAT I AM THINKING,btohqsg
i alr getting ostracised in class,btohqsg
If not can write in to like jpjc see if the principal is willing to accept anot,btohqsg
did i say anything to hurt the bully? i literally gave a viable option..,btohqsg
cuz my class all dl me anymore,btohqsg
they go n tell my new class abt me,btohqsg
dude...can't you just be in a class with the same combi,btohqsg
n then i gdt bullied again,btohqsg
Ya if trf better do it asap so that can join as a pu1 this year,btohqsg
just ask them to shift u to the BCMe class or smth,btohqsg
cannot my class the omly class with bme 3h2,btohqsg
but you still take the same combi,btohqsg
How are you going to tell me that is not viable...then you gonna accept someone that say to get themselves suspended,btohqsg
i cannot tske h2 double sci,btohqsg
He's the one that pulls down the average,btohqsg
I SAID THAT SO MANY TIMSS,btohqsg
Single-handedly responsible for the 60RP average coming out of YI,btohqsg
For every 1 90RP person there's a counter party to fuck over everyone,btohqsg
Ryan and rand beef has been running for so long lol,btohqsg
YES BUT CANT U DROP AN H2 SUBJ and replace with another,btohqsg
anyway MI results are better than YI results,btohqsg
Slow cooked beef marinated to perfection,btohqsg
can you take any non math combi,btohqsg
bro im gonna have to retain,btohqsg
Gotta play devil's advocate and say u gotta factor in that 1 extra year,btohqsg
Based on the 90rp rate and other anecdotal evidence available it seems true,btohqsg
can u change econs with any other humans,btohqsg
LOL a level supposed to be 3 years,btohqsg
sg govt being sg govt squeeze it to two years,btohqsg
Both schs won‚Äôt release more detailed stats cos the results are bad,btohqsg
MI is doing what's supposed to be done,btohqsg
bro i nvr tskr phy in sec sch,btohqsg
as much as u like bio  it's more impt to change combi to be in a better environment,btohqsg
Designed to be so I mean by right MI ppl have the full time to realise their potential,btohqsg
Yeah which was why I suggested it‚Äôs past time to tighten jc entry requirements,btohqsg
uk right i actl thought of this,btohqsg
and since the year I joined,btohqsg
Number 5 sounds like a win,btohqsg
MI has alr improved multiple times,btohqsg
Anyways MI is a merge of 2 schools I tot,btohqsg
bro that is hypothetical. what if ur new sch is better? you won't know until it happens,btohqsg
both of which are centralised  3 year institutes,btohqsg
but the chances of you getting into a better environment in a new sch is better than whatever shitty class you are in,btohqsg
that's what the cher say bro,btohqsg
So I mean by right it was always meant to be a thing,btohqsg
Just it got so shit at some point they were like we cut our loses,btohqsg
To Mi can if you referring to schs,btohqsg
I heard the principal is still bad tho,btohqsg
But they have some good chers,btohqsg
keep in mind hor the first three is L1B4 not L1R4,btohqsg
it's better to go to mi,btohqsg
outram institute specialise in business while Jurong institute is math and sci,btohqsg
Principal actually doesn't matter much imo,btohqsg
not sure  havent met him yet,btohqsg
better than being in such a shitty jc right,btohqsg
Oh I thought it was a her,btohqsg
i have high hopes for him,btohqsg
how do yall have so much inside info on the teachers and students of schools in sg,btohqsg
bro she wants me to stay w my bullies n even said that,btohqsg
They have quite little discretion and mainly there for day to day application of MOE mandates,btohqsg
alot left  i hope they have replacement good chers,btohqsg
It was the her that I heard bad stuff about,btohqsg
it's been the same her for the longest time,btohqsg
that she think i no evidence,btohqsg
if my current class is shit and classmates are giving me death threats  then yes i would take the chances,btohqsg
only recently change to a him,btohqsg
Good thing that they had a change,btohqsg
i mean wld u rather cont getting builled in ur current sch which is nearer to ur hse or gg to another sch tht the students there wont know ur past and a longer travel time?,btohqsg
RP also... used to be a him for a long time now it's a her,btohqsg
its fine  i got friends who live in pasir ris travel all the way to MI,btohqsg
your counselor is doing the EXACT OPPOSITE of what he is supposed to do,btohqsg
to ppl who say MI is far,btohqsg
my classmate travelled from JB everyday,btohqsg
i alr everyday sleep in class,btohqsg
my friend is in mi and he said the sch environment is nubbad,btohqsg
so if he can travel from JB to MI everyday and still score decently well,btohqsg
bro the whole discipline comm say they still investigating n say can only warn,btohqsg
Hey MOE teachers have job security for a reason,btohqsg
i cannot sleep at all before,btohqsg
they investigate how long alr sia,btohqsg
what time does he reach back home everyday bro,btohqsg
like someone said  the principal doesn't really matter - but to ans your question  she made some questionable decisions but generally cldve been worse,btohqsg
That one actually might work better.. for those east sider travelling from JB might be faster,btohqsg
but why is he suggesting to stay in the exact same class with the bullies arnd her,btohqsg
if someone willing to travel across the causeway for school,btohqsg
I think the principal can really make a big difference though. Looking at what NYJC achieved,btohqsg
U get assigned like 3 days per week that kind,btohqsg
wld u rather go to a sch beside your house that people tell u not to go to because of bad experiences  or somewhere else far as fuck but a place whr u have a higher chance of doing well,btohqsg
honestly..i literally never heard a single moe counsellor that went beyond their duties..majority of MOE counsellors ive heard barely help..and a minority even detiorates the conditions of their patients,btohqsg
??? teachers need to wait for an actual fight to break out before giving a shit ah,btohqsg
if u just want to sleep for 30min longer then priorities ah,btohqsg
Depends on how high the chance is,btohqsg
need to have another rv case,btohqsg
"""no blood  no foul"" teacher ahh üò≠",btohqsg
I think I talk to kuro before on proximity issue,btohqsg
yea i suppose. no impact better than negative impact bah,btohqsg
ya lor up to you to decide lor,btohqsg
aiya fuck this lame ass sch siah,btohqsg
stop encouraging rand to take out his axe bro,btohqsg
legit i very tempted to shame this sch,btohqsg
but if u go MI don't fuck that chance up,btohqsg
he shld do that to yijc,btohqsg
If it's literally 1-2% legit I think it's better to go to the nearest one,btohqsg
because ppl dropped out of MI  went to JC/poly/overseas,btohqsg
and tell me 2 years later they regret,btohqsg
But why drop out and go to JC?,btohqsg
u grad then later shittalk on reddit,btohqsg
i used to say counselling is like installing a speed camera on the highway...the patient is the speeder  once they pass the speed camera  they will just go back to speeding. Repeated sessions are just repeated placements of said speed cameras  bringing in authority is like placing a cop on the highway...but the moment they pass either the cop or the camera...the patient will still speed,btohqsg
Objectively? You don't it's up to the person how they weight the data,btohqsg
Only good reason I can think of is want to switch to new subject combi without retaining in MI,btohqsg
mindsets cant be changed through counselling is what i truly believe..ive said it here countless times  there have to be trauma for mindsets to change  counselling does not provide that,btohqsg
That's why u should just go to Poly and do Alevel privately,btohqsg
that's what all the former yi ppl did,btohqsg
shittalk de silva till there's no tmr,btohqsg
i know..thats why i said it,btohqsg
U laugh at me but if it works it works,btohqsg
idk if you caught it  but if you dont so be it,btohqsg
i mean if it works it works yes... but that's quite convoluted i really dk why u wld do that,btohqsg
What JCs do they transfer to though?,btohqsg
Bro u sure u aren't studying Yappology as a subject? U could get A for that,btohqsg
the general idea is counselling will never fix the problem..will just prolong the occurence of it from happening,btohqsg
sje alr mad enuf that innot in ri,btohqsg
MI to JPJC only a slight upgrade imo,btohqsg
she going to kick me out bro,btohqsg
i still rmb my RI friend begging me for my maths notes,btohqsg
Unfortunately I think as long as they in MI/JC can‚Äôt retake any o levels subject as a private candidate,btohqsg
I won't speak at all about why but errr hypothetically might be because they don't meet the COP for MI/JC,btohqsg
dw my parents are racist..fun living with them..haiz,btohqsg
