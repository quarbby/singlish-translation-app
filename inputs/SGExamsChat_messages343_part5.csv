Posted on Behalf of Project HermesVolunteer Project for Youth Mental Health + Walkathon for a Good CauseHi friends :D My friends and I are currently working on a YMCA Youth for Causes (YFC) project called Project Hermes  meant to help raise awareness about the importance of youth mental health  supporting the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) as our beneficiaries! So all the money we raise is going to them and the people they help. We‚Äôre reaching out to you guys here on r/SGExams to see if anyone‚Äôs interested in volunteering with us!There are two main areas where you can help out as a volunteer:First is with our mini-magazine! What this basically is is a 20-page booklet that‚Äôs going to have art like illustrations or photography and writing (both prose/poetry and more nonfiction-type)  all centered around the topic of mental health.The scope is pretty wide  so it could be stuff like your own journey with mental health  creative work depicting struggles  tips on how to maintain your mental wellness  etc. Obviously you‚Äôll be credited (under whatever name and with whichever details you prefer) for your work. Info on specs can be found here (https://projecthermes.carrd.co/#zine) and submissions can be emailed toprojecthermes444@gmail.com:DIf you‚Äôre keen on doing more than just submitting work  we‚Äôre also looking for people to help with layout and editing (ehe) so if you‚Äôre good with InDesign and things like that do reach out if you‚Äôre interested!Lastly is helping out with our publicity; we‚Äôre planning to put up information about different mental conditions on our social media pages (on IG and TikTok etc.) as well as try to get more discussion about mental health going so we can make this topic less taboo and spread proper info instead of letting people stick with their misperceptions. Your part on this front would be helping to think of and create the content to be posted!So if you are interested in volunteering  just fill up this form here (https://s.giving.sg/Mo6y72G)  and we‚Äôll be in touch shortly! And we‚Äôll be really really really really really grateful if you do choose to :33If you don‚Äôt have the time to volunteer (but still want to help!)  we‚Äôre also running a virtual walkathon  since increased physical activity is linked to improved mental wellness. For $10  you can sign up and potentially win prizes if you‚Äôre among the highest distances walked (like FoodPanda vouchers!!). It‚Äôs $40 for 5  so you can also rope your friends in! The walkathon will take place from 1 to 30 August. AS A BONUSSS if you sign up by 18 July you‚Äôll get a free shirt! Dri-fit with a design that we‚Äôll put up fully on our Instagram@proj.hermes.You can also donate to ourgiving.sghere (https://s.giving.sg/Mo6y72G) or participate in our merch sales slated for later this year; every dollar we get is matched 1-to-1 by the government so your contributions will really mean a lot for our beneficiaries!!That‚Äôs about it for now. Follow us on IG to keep up with updates (cuz we‚Äôve got more in store)  and thanks for reading this far! If you‚Äôve got questions  feel free to DM us (on Reddit or IG) or reply to this post  or even email us atprojecthermes444@gmail.comif you‚Äôre more comfortable. Hope y‚Äôall have a great day!!!!,btohqsg

Signing up has helped me understand how to solve certain problems and the additional tips provided by the tutors are helpful.‚Äù-- a National Junior College student,btohqsg
