Average sedan/bigger hatchback/small SUV is 2 to 3k usually,btohqsg
The wrap sticker only few dollars. But the labour few thousand.,btohqsg
Sir still waiting for your HUD picture and laksa recommendation,btohqsg
Very nice looking though  spacious car  owner maintain well I think,btohqsg
Roof high only. Backseats cramp like hell,btohqsg
Very true in ChinaG WAGON is a sign of success and entrepreneurship 😂👍,btohqsg
Isnt it more of the brand than the model instead?,btohqsg
Why this HUD show middle finger 😂👍,btohqsg
Think is the size.Look more down to earth kind of person who drives G Wagon.If you drive 2 door Supercar more like spoil brats  womenizer etc,btohqsg
Sunset way😅 go vet or polypets😂👍,btohqsg
The G makes the cayenne looks midget 😂,btohqsg
ferrari cali is a very VERY outdated car,btohqsg
way less reliable than a porsche,btohqsg
the car is dog sh!t for its price,btohqsg
True. July onwards I think.Malaysia plate cannot every goes into SG. Saw in tiktok,btohqsg
sat in cali and 911 many times and every single time i will alw conclude the 911 is better,btohqsg
From 800 onwards.Disadvantages will have slight peel off. Wear and Tear.,btohqsg
few thousand  my advice is dont go for cheap wrapping,btohqsg
they can cause ur own paint to tear off,btohqsg
not on my car but saw it first hand,btohqsg
Maybe u used to being poor so sit in Ferrari u feel uncomfortable?,btohqsg
last i checked u cant even buy the 992 with 2 californias,btohqsg
Ohhh. I always go sunset way poly pets. Many varieties of kibbles and treats. Many good American brands,btohqsg
i am gonna assume u lack half a brain  992 is the current generation of 911 :),btohqsg
https://www.facebook.com/banleesengpaints/Do paint betterTheir paint very nice 👍Akika Cherry Red very nice,btohqsg
Oic. So just change the 911 bonnet then rename as 992?,btohqsg
cause we thought of wrapping the car to protect the paint 😂,btohqsg
we shall place this game  everytime u say something stupid u lose 50% of your current brain,btohqsg
I think turbo S rly nice,btohqsg
didnt know u like being treated like a young boy before his b@lls has descended,btohqsg
Ministry of detailing for $500 off promo now for wrapping,btohqsg
but the Turbo S is really different,btohqsg
speed is phenomenal  makes me wonder how they are gonna make the next generation faster,btohqsg
Add hybrid tech to the current engine,btohqsg
might not be fast because it add weight to the already heavy car haha,btohqsg
thats true haha  maybe the frunk gets smaller?🥲🥲,btohqsg
Maybe the chassis will be made out of battery,btohqsg
But add a regular car on top,btohqsg
I dunno  u can pm them,btohqsg
Try parking a RR in Shaw House MSCP. The tiny lot is just terrible even if you are driving your average BMW 5 series or Mercedes E class. Hahaha. There are other ways to show off like wear a ridiculously expensive watch or Hermes Himalayan Croc Birkin bag.,btohqsg
How old is the paint? Touch up paint and do coating,btohqsg
Can protect but will not look as good as paint  seldom find wraps that are so good and they are very expensive,btohqsg
Our local drivers and riders also noisy,btohqsg
