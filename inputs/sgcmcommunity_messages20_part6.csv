even if you go to PI workshops they wont too. as you dont buy from them. of course they will load up premiums when you want to do it.,btohqsg
when i said they wont means they will quote you in such a way that it is as good as not wanting you.,btohqsg
so no need to be technical here,btohqsg
Hmmm  maybe you should go try it out then. I know of people who have done this and they did not face any issues  just paid roughly the same as an AD car or PI from dealer car,btohqsg
there are situations where you want to go to dealers to do due to thier exerience and better equioment level  but they just wont entertain cars not sold by them.,btohqsg
definitely not roughly the same. i know this because my friend bought from PI.,btohqsg
Hmmmm  those I know have not faced this  different tiers and brands of cars as well,btohqsg
in malaysiam because of the size of maerkets  the less busy ones will entertain. the busiest ones with lots of customers like autobavaria (PML equivalent) will ask you for rm20K first to open account.,btohqsg
We in sgcarmart leh‚Ä¶ not mycarmart,btohqsg
Eh‚Ä¶ good ring though. MyCarMart.@SGCM_Admincan consider as MIA? Member Idea in Action,btohqsg
A few bonus chances for good suggestions?,btohqsg
Yeah  we're talking about Singapore here,btohqsg
Malaysia market dynamics are very different,btohqsg
haha in singapore i know PML wont make you fork out money to open account.,btohqsg
Service is where they make good margins on as we know‚Ä¶ a famous ws makes 100% on each part man,btohqsg
Yes Mr Xun  they will just charge you maybe a few hundred extra for the whole service (case dependent on the cost of whatever is being done) and offer you the warranty packs. For them it's easy business because they lose you on the sales side so can make up on the service side because no need to offer warranty if it's just service but still earn the same amount as the AD cars.,btohqsg
Delivery miles  so will consider new  just PI. Most PIs list their ready stock with delivery miles as used cars on sgcm but also have the same listing under new from what I've seen. Most of them you are the first owner on record too,btohqsg
correct Mr Arnav  great that i manage to understand you in a few sentences!,btohqsg
"This particular unit was used by them for demos so I guess you can say ""new"" but they bring in unregistered no owner stock too",btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt officially launch in SG leh‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Im looking forward to see the GR86 officially launch in SG! What about you?,btohqsg
Thought the BRZ launch already? Was at the Subaru dealer last week,btohqsg
Nope  havent. Expected launch date is early 2023,btohqsg
for sure haha  new GR86  BRZ and Nissan Z. this generation of lightweight sports cars might unfortunately be the last generation that will be fully petrol powered.,btohqsg
Lets hope mazda will come out w a new MX5 too,btohqsg
Ah I see  guess the one at their leng kee dealer is just for demo and show then,btohqsg
Yup most likely to ‚Äúpoison‚Äù potential customersüòÜ,btohqsg
Which subbie you looking at anyways?,btohqsg
Just spotted it while going by,btohqsg
subies are not meant to be driven,btohqsg
they belong to the jackstands of workshops,btohqsg
technically is a toyota so got hope,btohqsg
Wah the way you say it thoüòÇ,btohqsg
you ever see anybody try to do the cannonball with a subie? no. all attempts fail within 15mins,btohqsg
Didn't news reported that Subbie relented and will be releasing WRX STI?,btohqsg
A very illegal run to set a record time from the red ball garage in new york to the portofino hotel in LA,btohqsg
OOOO but I don‚Äôt think BRZ is made to be fast tho,btohqsg
Thought its more of a handling car hahaha,btohqsg
the past records were held by cars like an S6  E63  etc.,btohqsg
calling all BRZ/86 owners  your admin call your car slowüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
this record has been beaten already if i'm not wrong. There's also a Diesel car and electric car record,btohqsg
no STI this year sadly ü•≤,btohqsg
ok u give me pls üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1X2fEjFQxQ&ab_channel=VINwikiThe tesla record  no other EV has attempted as the supercharger network in north america is unmatched,btohqsg
Still faster than the flat 4 of my beetle. ü§£,btohqsg
aiyo shane ah  i give you car that can drive want anot.. i scared i give u wrx sti u also cannot drive,btohqsg
Lets just say they don't get caught because of things they equip,btohqsg

"@arnavgulianianyway  just got news that although the BRZ is already in the showroom but there wont be any official launch for it.Motor Image willlikely""launch"" it at the Singapore Motorshow 2023.",btohqsg
