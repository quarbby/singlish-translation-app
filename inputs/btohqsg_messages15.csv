Thank you for the advice! Okay  can start looking out for SBF already. Haha,btohqsg
Would like to ask if anyone has a rough idea of how much HDB loan will one get with a salary of $3K  no car  credit etc?single income..thanks in advance,btohqsg
Usually you can use the hdb calculator  but its being updated to include the new measures  so for now can use normal mortage calculators  there are loads of options  can put 3% to estimate,btohqsg
Np! Pls note that its just an estimate  best is to use HDB's calculator if you want to take hdb loan,btohqsg
Been trying for SBF this year but it look there‚Äôs miserable choices & very limited chance for a 3rm.,btohqsg
Thanks for the advise but I prefer brand new flat & cos that will b my 2nd new flat meaning I got to take the 40k levy into consideration as part of the budget .. make it harder for me.,btohqsg
Correct  if I‚Äôm not wrong $40k that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt get a unit which cost out of my budget as I may not be able to fetch a good price for my current 4rm.,btohqsg
Hi. I have a question  if i gotten a good bto number but still interested to look at sbf in nov. Do i need to give up my bto to apply for sbf?,btohqsg
Nope. You can keep applying for bto/sbf up until you select a flat  at which point they will cancel all other applications for you,btohqsg
if i decide to let go of my May Ballot and proceed with Aug Ballot. must i call HDB and inform them?,btohqsg
Pray hard that there are ppl in front giving up their appt,btohqsg
You mean you got Nov 2021 ballot to go and select a flat in May 2022 ??,btohqsg
I got a queue no for nov 2021 and went ahead to apply for may 2022 bto.. i got invited to select a flat under nov 2021 tengah bto and hdb cancelled my may 2022 bto application..,btohqsg
The reason why i applied for may 2022 bto was because my nov 2021 bto queue no is 417 out of 409 available units.. and i do not know when i can get to select my flat,btohqsg
Yup I‚Äôm just wondering that Nov 2021 you get a queue number and only can go and select a flat only six months later ! Pretty long t√Æme,btohqsg
Yeah‚Ä¶ i applied for nov 2021 tengah bto.. in fact i only waited for ard 4 months as the selection exercise only started somewhere on feb 2022,btohqsg
Thought all selections start two/ three weeks after bto ballot results are out .,btohqsg
And my queue no was out of supply‚Ä¶ selection for those queue no of supply only started on 27 jun‚Ä¶ and im the first few to go select,btohqsg
This is the email that i received from hdb,btohqsg
So for the Aug 2022 bto   selection starts when   do you know ?,btohqsg
If im not wrong it will start on nov 2022‚Ä¶ this is according to one of my friend who applied for the aug 2022 bto,btohqsg
What I know oso is on nov 2022,btohqsg
No it depends project to project,btohqsg
Noted thanks   this Bto so confusing ü§Øüòì,btohqsg

Hi there  would like to ask if anyone knows how the queue # for mgps works i.e Is the queue # separated by unit type 2rm/4rm  2rm/5rm etc. or all of the mgps applicants regardless of unit type?,btohqsg
One more qns on mgps: If our queue# falls out of the # of pre-allocated units by around 5  will the chances of getting a child flat be very low?,btohqsg
Mgps is confirmed can book a flat,btohqsg
ABOUT GRO/MGPS/PUBLIC QUEUESüè†Grassroots Organisation (GRO) Scheme queueThis is a priority scheme reserved for grassroots leaders who have served for at least 3 years. There is not much information from a government source that is publicly available (other thanthis)  but the GRO queue always goes first in a selection. It's not all dandy though - they only can select from a list of preselected units.Additional info:¬ª The GRO queue starts from Q0001.üè† Multi-Generation Priority Scheme (MGPS) queue(s)Applicants of this scheme select a 2-room flat or larger  together with their parents who select a 2-room or 3-room flat. The MGPS queue starts after the GRO queue ends  with 2+x going first  followed by 3+x. Similar to GRO scheme applicants  MGPS applicants are also limited by a preselected list of units. You may read more about the MGPShere.Additional info:¬ª The parents' flat type determines which queue an MGPS application is under  e.g. if parents chose 3-room  the application will be under the 3+x queue.¬ª The 2+x queue comprises (2+2)  2+3  2+4  and 2+5  while the 3+x queue comprises (3+2)  3+3  3+4  3+5.¬ª The configurations in brackets are technically possible  though rare.About MGPS queue numbers:¬ª Each queue (2+x and 3+x) is independent of each other  i.e. the first of each queue can be Q0001 though not necessarily.¬ªTo be more precise  the MGPS queue numbers start from the last GRO queue number of the parent flat typeplus any 2+2 (for 2R)  or 2+3 or 3+3 pairs (for 3R). For example  if there are 5 3R GRO  1 MGPS 2+3 pair and 2 MGPS 3+3 pairs  then the MGPS 3+x queue will start from Q0009.üè† Public QueueThis is everything else! After the GRO and MGPS selections are over  all untaken units are now 'free for all'. You usually can tell when public queue has started when the units taken start to make 'more sense' (e.g. top floors of a 'better' stack going first). Alternatively  for those who have already gotten your appointment dates  you can also 'confirm' this by logging into the HDB portal  clicking on your application registration number  and seeing if you can view thelast queue number of the day. If you can  public queue has started.Additional info:¬ª All priority schemes other than GRO or MGPS will fall under the public queue  e.g. PPS  MCPS.¬ª If there are 10 4R GRO applicants  and 20 4R MGPS applicants  the first number in the 4R public queue will be Q0031.__The above is information that I (@smchua) have put together from having been watching BTO selections for a while. Though said  as I'm not a HDB spokesperson  please do take what I say with a pinch of salt as these are merely my observations; they are not definitively factual.,btohqsg
Thank you very much for the enlightenmentüòÉSince there isn‚Äôt much out there I could find on the mgps,btohqsg
Where do i go to see this?,btohqsg
When the price everything  came out and if u have the q,btohqsg
I have a queue number  but i log into hdb page i don't see anything. Is it too early?,btohqsg
It might not be out yet  but it'll be the page where you can see all the project details like the site plan  number of available flats etc. The prices will be at the bottom of the page  right now it may be just the range of prices shown,btohqsg
I see  thanks so much for explaining!,btohqsg

Hello! I'm a reporter and I'm looking to speak with ppl who have BTO-ed several times and failed  or eventually gave up and bought resale. If you're open to sharing your experience with me  do DM me pls  thanks!,btohqsg
drop me a note. i am frustrated and annoyed at this. didn't the gov say they will prioritise those who have continuously failed at the August 2022 BTO? it's my 4th time and still#notachosenone,btohqsg
all 4 times in mature estate or non mature? Non mature  each failure will give you more ballot chances.. but not the same for mature estates,btohqsg
all 4 time in non-mature estates,btohqsg
Sad... 5/6 years ago.. i failed 7 or 8 times.. but also cause my partner and I picky... all matured estate,btohqsg
Be careful when you go public  the government will go into detail what you do and if you are not willing to tell the truth it might back fire you.,btohqsg
Ya and pofma and sue u in court,btohqsg
Not so serious  they just make you a fool.,btohqsg
HDB therefore encourages all flat applicants to select a flat when they have the chance to do so. Those who choose not to book a flat will be issued a non-selection count (NSC).First-timer families who accumulate two non-selection counts will have their subsequent flat applications moved to the second-timer category for a year.Second-timer families who accumulate two non-selection counts will not be able to participate in subsequent sales exercises for a year.Additionally  first-timer families who have been unsuccessful in two or more attempts for a BTO flat in the non-mature estates (NMEs) receive an additional ballot chance for each subsequent NME BTO application.Virtually all first-timer families who apply for NME BTO flats are successful within their first three tries.However  the count of unsuccessful NME BTO applications will be reset to zero if a first-timer family chooses not to book a flat when offered a chance to do so.https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/parliament-matters/q-as/view/written-answer-by-ministry-of-national-development-on-hbd-bto-applicants-not-choosing-their-flats-and-its-operational-impact,btohqsg

That's great  but you saying 365 days is also patently absurd since it implies no one even takes a weekend to Johor. I guess I'll ask the next counter lady I see at the branch.,btohqsg
I don't know what the heck u are saying.,btohqsg
1 year is 365 days no?,btohqsg
If u take ur key on 15 January 2022  1 year MOP is till 14 January 2023. Simple as that. Don't complicate things by saying going to Johor. Unless u want to count the actual number of hours u are at home.,btohqsg
So I don't understand your sentence of me being absurd that no one takes a weekend to Johor. Back to your question  unless u got HDB email as written proof  not he say she say counter say  that your MOP can end early  I highly suggest u don't test their system.,btohqsg

Good morning  i was reading about the PLH flats and they mentioned that flat buyers are eligible for extra grants on top of EHG which will be subject to subsidy clawback in the future‚Ä¶ anyone knows how much extra grants is given/ how it works?,btohqsg
Currently  HDB BTO buyers enjoy subsidised prices and CPF Enhanced Housing Grants or EHG (if eligible). For the new Prime Location Public Housing flats in prime areas  prices will be furtherreduced with additional subsidies from the Government.It is not announced how much the additional subsidies will be  but it will likely be fixed for each project (i.e.  unlike the EHG  it will not consider your income).,btohqsg
Extra grants are already ‚Äúfactored‚Äù into the price  will only know when the project is launch. E.g. River peaks at 6%. Actual amount of grant is not known.,btohqsg
Please know the risk about PLH.,btohqsg
So the price launched is already with the extra grants or isit the price launch - 6%?,btohqsg
Already part of the price launch. So we wouldn‚Äôt exactly know how much they subsidised,btohqsg

Hi i was wondering now the downpayment is 20% if got deferred payment scheme how much do we need to pay for the first half?,btohqsg
5%  then 15% during the 2nd half,btohqsg
Terms is that the younger of the couple needs to be < 30yo,btohqsg
Hi can i check for the HLE loan  will it drop if i change job half way and have a month interval of no CPF after the original loan amount has been given during the selection of house from the actual collection of key? Saw it on tiktok not too sure if it is true? and wanted to verify itüòÖ,btohqsg
Best to call HDB and check. most accurate answer will be from them,btohqsg
https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSRoSdeLrNot too sure tho as in the video she say that her client's HLE loan amount dropped,btohqsg
Hello all  do you if there is MGPS scheme for this yishun BTO exercise?,btohqsg
There are Advertisement that give you half truth information so as to get you to call them call fishing.,btohqsg
You don't keep applying for HLE,btohqsg
This means that HLE should only be applied only 2 times right? One during selection of flat and second time towards the collection of keys?,btohqsg
Hi can i check for the HLE loan  will it drop if i change job half way and have a month interval of no CPF after the original loan amount has been given during the selection of house from the actual collection of key?Once you sign the booking it is cast in stone.,btohqsg
Technically should be one only. Unless you go and apply another one and give to HDB.,btohqsg
Which BTO don't have MGPS?Multi-Generation Priority Scheme (MGPS)Parents and their married child can make a joint application for 2 flats in a BTO project where 2-room Flexi or 3-room flats are integrated in the flat mix.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/application/priority-schemes,btohqsg
I see! okies thank you for this! üôÇ,btohqsg
So far I don‚Äôt see every BTO exercise offers this option.,btohqsg
Where did you read the BTO project don't offer MGPS?,btohqsg
I am not sure if I understand you correctly. But it will appear as an option in the application should it be allowed. That‚Äôs what I saw from the last last application,btohqsg
ic  and the BTO now don't have the option  is that what you mean.,btohqsg
"yep looks like the interface changed slightly this year. select your flat type first  then when you click ""next"" you'll be prompted to select MGPS or non-MGPS",btohqsg
Roger! Have u gone in to see,btohqsg
BTO project where 2-room Flexi or 3-room flats are integrated in the flat mix.,btohqsg
btw  technically got BTO that don't offer MGPS haha. like you said  if no 2R or 3R then won't have. the most recent example is hougang nov 2021 (hougang olive and tanjong tree residences),btohqsg
yep  played with the interface that's how i found out the change in hierarchy for the MGPS option,btohqsg
what  no. so far all the PLH's have MGPS.[edit]here we go  the appt date trackers for all PLH's launched so far  with the exception of aug 2022's as their selection hasn't started yet. but yep all have PLH!Nov 2021:River Peaks I & II (Central)Feb 2022:King George's Heights (Kallang/Whampoa)May 2022:Bukit Merah Ridge (Bukit Merah)May 2022:Ghim Moh Ascent (Queenstown),btohqsg
My mistake is the other one,btohqsg
i see. there's MCPS for PLH also  though? just that the quota is lower  that's all,btohqsg
hello  the HLE application is done during the flat selection stage right?,btohqsg
when is the EHG grant amount determined*?,btohqsg
Flat selection n nearer to key collection,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask  does this mean for Bukit Batok/Tengah  only 20% is for first timer couple?!,btohqsg
but below also say this  so I am quite confused,btohqsg
65% for couples without children  20% for first timer families with children i think,btohqsg
ohhh so it‚Äôll be assessed twice okay,btohqsg
can i just gauge right  for a couple with a combined gross salary of $8k/month  what is the max loan amount that HDB typically gives?,btohqsg
cause rn our gross salary is $5k/month  but we were only given $189k in max loan amount  is this normal or on the low side?,btohqsg
Previously in 2019 when my combined average was 5.5k  my granted amount was around 350k for BTO,btohqsg
Hi all  for this BTO exercise  if we want to apply for one of the Queenstown projects  understand we cannot choose the specific proj  but will be applying for all 3 based on flat type. This is not the norm right? Any idea how this will work in terms of balloting & flat selection?,btohqsg
Depends on your age and other loan etc.,btohqsg
Is there an application rate tracker for Sales of balance? The above seems to be for BtO only,btohqsg
"yes  that's why the post is titled ""BTO"" üòÖhttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Nov2022_SBF?strSystem=SBFfor SBF!you can also consider joining@sghdbsbffor the community discussing all things SBF (:",btohqsg
If you search this chat using the word 'lump'  it sounded like it's the norm to lump projects within the same estate together.,btohqsg
This is the norm. They don‚Äôt separate the locations as they‚Äôre all under Queenstown estate. ballot for Queenstown regardless which one you aiming for and don‚Äôt expect too much if you get bad queue number lor,btohqsg
i see! thanks for the clarification!,btohqsg
this is the norm. At Aug21  there were two plots of land at Hougang. One number  two plots.,btohqsg
if u get a not so good number  and want high floor  can consider choosing the not so popular plot out of the three. This was how i got a top floor unit last year at the less popular plot,btohqsg
Hi  can apply sbf and bto at the same time?,btohqsg
no you can only apply one,btohqsg
For 2rm flexi if getting 30yrs  price divide by 3?,btohqsg
when will I be able to apply for the PPHS housing scheme? during agreement signing?,btohqsg
Do I add my newborn as an occupier?,btohqsg
Hi why I don‚Äôt see BTO on river peak?,btohqsg
The Straits Times 24 Nov 2022- Over 9 600 BTO flats offered in mega HDB launch Part 2,btohqsg
Thank you. How do I send in application?,btohqsg
My mum‚Äôs age is now 62..if apply  need to buy how many years lease?,btohqsg
Not upon completion of the new unit ..,btohqsg
Please note if application return NRIC 5% will be gone if I am not wrong.,btohqsg
Anyone got the woodlands glade bto group?I only got into the MyRepublic groupbuy one.https://t .me/woodlandsglade,btohqsg
Hi i know when i fail for non mature bto i get one more ballot chance for the subsequent application but lets say I‚Äôve failed twice for non mature and now i apply mature for my subsequent application does my ballot chance go to 0 or still 2 more ballot chances,btohqsg
Hi can I ask what does point w meant by ‚Äúinclude those who have applied in earlier sales launches‚Äù?,btohqsg
20% of the total application  of this 20%  40% did not book a unit.If the rate is 1.7 you got a chance to book a unit.,btohqsg
Not true from personal and friends experiences. Got 1.28x but supply ran out  and they also see ethic quota,btohqsg
Hmm I believe the 40% is talking about for people who got a number to select flat  40% usually might drop out.I am confused about what does it meant by 20% of the application rates included previous round?,btohqsg
Some people who have applied in previous launches have gotten their ballot number and are waiting for flat selection appointment  but maybe number not great so they apply for the coming launch too. While they add to the application number of the launch  they may still take up the previous launch once they choose flat so then they would have dropped from the queue for current launch. And apparently this makes up 20% of the overall applications for each launch.,btohqsg
correct  that is also what I understand,btohqsg
Hi guys i just created a group for Rivervale shores hdb flatshere you gohttps://t.me/+4wuCIFlQe5YzZTI1,btohqsg
second appointment still require to pay  stamp duty,btohqsg
please don't expect the EHG will cover all the cost  unless u want to take the risk to do so because u will only know the amount before your second appointment,btohqsg
Hi all!  I would like to ask all the pros here whether HDB will review ceiling cap for HLE during key collection for BTOs?Previously I have gotten a HLE approved when i selected my flat about 3 years ago....Today  my wife and I have 'busted' the salary cap of $14 000 but would like to continue with HDB loan  anyone can advise whether we are still eligible? we are collecting keys in the next 6 months,btohqsg
Once selected and paid the deposit HDB don't check.,btohqsg
If you worry can always call HDB to confirm.https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/contact-us,btohqsg
Hi! I would like to know if the SBF flats for first timer that applied but didnt get a flat  will they get a higher chance?,btohqsg
compared to first timer first time apply,btohqsg
This Nov BTO launch flat completion is Q22029. So long.Anyone knows if this timeframe will remain the same for subsequent BTO launch? Or may be shorter? Used to be 3yrs max 4 years to complete,btohqsg
You already said use to be.  Now is a norm to be more than 4 years,btohqsg
If you want short one  go see Tengah there. That‚Äôs the shortest waiting time,btohqsg
Good and cheap won't be fastCheap and fast won't be goodGood and fast won't be cheap,btohqsg

I have a question. I used the HDB calculator. A 400k hdb loan balloon to 540k. Can someone enlighten me how is it calculated?,btohqsg
More context please did u add the interest ?,btohqsg
Hi can i check if anyone knows why my application with my fiancee for a SBF at woodlands is under public scheme? is it cos the amount of flats available less than 20 so is only public scheme? even tho i filled the form as my fiancee as co applicant,btohqsg
I was thinking why they write public scheme,btohqsg
is it? cos on HDB website there is 2 different schemes  1 for public and 1 is Fianc√©/Fianc√©e Scheme,btohqsg
Yes I applied 5 times under fiance scheme and itispublic scheme,btohqsg
this was what one of the person in the SBF telegram told me ah  but im not a 100% sure,btohqsg
Im guessing if we dont fall under pps or mcps  then we are public scheme?,btohqsg
maybe will call HDB on monday,btohqsg
Okies  if u have an update please do let me know too!,btohqsg
Add all the %  any left for others.,btohqsg
Can share Tengah parcwoods chatgrp. Thanks,btohqsg
Which group do you fall under  PPS  MCPS or Others families,btohqsg
others i guess  because no PPS or MCPS,btohqsg
Excuse me  who is the administrator?,btohqsg
where do we see the application rate for nov 2022 SBF?,btohqsg
The last column is the overall application rate,btohqsg
Hello! Does any one knows if I need to apply for a new HLE (esp since the LTV dropped to 80%)?Applied for our HLE in June  expiring in Dec. But our SBF results will only be out in Feb 2023. This means our HLE has expired and no longer valid?Or we can use the same HLE letter since it was since valid when we did the SBF application aka now? :‚Äô),btohqsg
May I check is there a way to edit the BTO application form?,btohqsg
yes  theres an amend button on the application page  but the type of flat cannot be amended i think.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to calculate the Application Rate for First Timers (4rm)üåö. Like how many applicants in 1.2?,btohqsg
0.95 x no. of available flats in that flat type x application rate shown under first timers = number of ppl that applied for that flat type,btohqsg
Anybody got sunsail bto at sembawang?,btohqsg
Hi i emailed to HDB to request to change my application to MCPS. They replied to say it is changed  but at the HDB portal i am still declared as public scheme. is that normal?,btohqsg

Hi all  got a question if I applied sbf already and wanna change to bto application. I need to cancel and reapply?,btohqsg
Hi i apply for nov launch under mcps. Can i get it removed?,btohqsg
i think can email via the feedback form to removed  cuz mine is the opposite. i applied without mcps but i want to add it after my application.,btohqsg
Hi  can I know how to amend my bto application once submitted? I wish to change from a 4 room flat to a 5 room flat within the same region. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg

U need it when u go choose ur unit.,btohqsg
Just to check if on HDB Loan can change to bank loan after a few yrs right?,btohqsg
Currently on hdb loan for resale without grant. If i take another hdb loan for bto  how is the commercial rate calculated? The commercial rate will start after key collection? Until i sell off the 1st unit?,btohqsg
change for what? bank rate so high you confirm cry,btohqsg
do i have to buy the latest credit report when i re-apply for HLE again? or can i use the one 6 months ago?,btohqsg
I think it depends if they got ask you for it on the next one. Cos what I know is not everyone require the report. U just reapply first  if they ask for it then u buy again lor.,btohqsg
Okies  I think I will try that  thanks!,btohqsg

Hi  can I ask if BTO 15% downpayment is calculated after offsetting the grants from the original price?,btohqsg
i think the EHG is just credited into your OA  so the 15% should be the 15% of the original price (CORRECT ME IF I‚ÄôM WRONG),btohqsg
I came across some articles that talked about BTO downpayment  some says 15% and some says 10% so which one is the correct one though,btohqsg
Or it depends on how much HDB loan you can get then the downpayment percentage will be determine from that?,btohqsg
https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/financing-a-flat-purchase/housing-loan-options/housing-loan-from-hdbWhen in doubt good to go back to HDB website instead of gas gas gas.,btohqsg
Remember what you get in the EHG will be compound 2.6% until you return the money to your CPF Account,btohqsg
Much earlier years it was 10%  then recent years was 15%  Sep 2022 is 20%.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt down payment 10%  based on hbd website?,btohqsg
Downpayment at signing lease 10%Downpayment at key collection another 10%Total 20%,btohqsg
This is from 30th Sept 2022 onward,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt we pay remainder amount during key collection  after including the loans?,btohqsg
20% is minimum amount required‚Ä¶The rest will either be required to be covered by HDB or Bank Loan  any amount not covered will need to be paid in cash,btohqsg
HDB loan will require you to wipe your CPF leaving a max of 20k in reserve,btohqsg

Hi  anyone have experience with MCPS (Married child policy scheme) ? Are parents required to be in person for flat booking? We have gotten our queue number and was wondering will we lose it if our parents couldn't make it for the appointment (sc currently working overseas but have property that qualify for mcps),btohqsg
They dont need to be  they will video call your parents,btohqsg
What happens if we waive MCPS ? Will they disqualify us or would we get a worst queue number?,btohqsg
Best to call hdb to understand the implications for your exact situation :),btohqsg
they will video call parents during the appointment?,btohqsg
what if parents not free? at work or something haha,btohqsg
Ermmm that im not sure sorry,btohqsg
Hi can I check if both of the parents are required to be present in the call?,btohqsg
just one of them is okay,btohqsg
hi all  can I clarify can essential occupier be one of the buyer for the BTO?,btohqsg
Normally is try not to use too many name(Owner). This is consider one property count and the next property will be 17% ABSD.,btohqsg
Also for the HLE  if the applicant is still in NS but his partner is already been working but not local  still can get HLE?,btohqsg
Is HLE letter required during booking date or signing of agreement lease date?,btohqsg
Hello If already booked flat selected unit and first HLE approved  and waiting for EGH and 2nd appt. If at this time I facing the possibility of a job change  will it affect anything with my application,btohqsg
Not like buy bto cannot change job like that,btohqsg
Just that u need the ehg access date pay slip,btohqsg
Means your current job pay slips make sure u have all those before u go,btohqsg
Later u left they don't want give u gg,btohqsg
In case they ask for more document for ehg,btohqsg
Need both of them to be present at the call.,btohqsg
During the 1st appointment  you can inform the officer that your parents are not available to take the call today. In my case  they were out of the country for vacation. HDB will follow up  via email  to arrange for a video call via whatsapp with parents  on another date.,btohqsg
Much appreciated  is it possible to waive the scheme. We weren't fully aware of the mop. My parents do prefer the flexibility to sell their current house within 10 years. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
No idea  you may need someone from HDB to answer this question.,btohqsg
Hi  can I just with everyone here.Is there anyone who works as food delivery rider(using bicycle) got rejected for the HLE...?,btohqsg
If working delivery rider or driver No CPF contribution HDB will nit approve the HLE.Is like do u dare to lend a stranger money $200K if he/she no full time job ?My brother is working as a food delivery rider which he every month just contribute some cash to his own CPF to at least show HDB have a constant $ in the CPF  the keys is *Constant*.What i suggest is if wants the HLE to get approved  then put Money in CPF now till the next HDB appointment.,btohqsg
Hi@Ahhow1990Having said that  do I not do a reapplication for the HLE  and just wait for the 1st appointment?At the same time  do a CPF contribution constantly.,btohqsg
Ya from now on u put Cash to CPF then show at 1st appointment now u have cpf. Then 2nd appointment come should be able to be approved,btohqsg
Self employed do have other kind of document to submit for hle,btohqsg
I believe  u can google online,btohqsg
I will inform him to do so. Thank you so much for this alternative.üôèüèΩ,btohqsg
I did try google  maybe i did not search enoughüòÖ,btohqsg
Hi..Sorry disturb..Any one have Woodlands Champion Bliss group chat?Thanks..,btohqsg
Hdb exempted student and NSF army guy from HLE,btohqsg
Till your 2nd or 3 appt will ask to apply HLE again based on the current jobs,btohqsg
U can find every info inhdhDB website,btohqsg
U mean options fee ? Is cash,btohqsg
Down payment is CPF if not enough top up cashBut down payment sure can one la  EHG all cover,btohqsg
If 1 not working and only 1 working sure can get almost max EHG to use for down payment of flat .Below 30 years old 5% of flat30 above 10% need to pay,btohqsg
Just wait for your grant to minus the down payment of cpf not enough lor,btohqsg
That's what happen to my friends that both do not have CPF lagi worse,btohqsg
hi everyone  can i check if downpayment is the full price  or is it minus EHG already?also is it 15% or 20%?,btohqsg
What u mean the full price ?,btohqsg
U can use ehg as part of your downpayment.If u go for hleBank loan downpayment  amount is different and need cash too,btohqsg
can i clarify then -if we are going for HLE  ehg will be disbursed first?and then ehg can be used as downpayment?,btohqsg
Down payment is 10% of the houseStaggered Downpayment is 5% of the houseEHG is EHG. Thats the grant you getThe number shown in the Downpayment is what you need to payYou can use EHG to pay for the Downpayment. It usually approves before the agreement for lease so that you can pay with your EHG for your Downpayment,btohqsg
i think coz of the cooling measures,btohqsg
staggered downpayment is 5% at first appt  15% at collection of keysnormal downpayment is 10% at first appt and 10% at collection of keys,btohqsg
so if i take hle  there is a chance that my cpf would not be affected as well as it's just deducted from ehg?,btohqsg
EHG will be credited to your CPF,btohqsg
And that gets priority to house payment,btohqsg
depends on how much your ehg is  it is credited to your CPF,btohqsg
yeah thats what i am confused!,btohqsg
i am wondering about the second appt after you pay the option fee,btohqsg
HLE is to see how much you can loan/afford so they can access if you can afford buying the house,btohqsg
Thats the agreement for lease am I right?,btohqsg
Thats where they access/advice/judge whether you can afford the house  how you can make payment and all,btohqsg
So HLE then is a gauge for them to see,btohqsg
i had read at that point you pay 20% of the house via your CPF. there's no mention of EHG.,btohqsg
How much can you loan and how much EHG CPF Cash all,btohqsg
EHG will be credited by then already,btohqsg
If not can call the officer,btohqsg
Then after that key collection they will give u a final loan offer,btohqsg
They will also send u letter whether u need to reapply hle,btohqsg
Cos hle is available for 6 months,btohqsg
so to confirm the process -1. get bto number2. go for appt  select unit  show hle application  pay option fee- in between - EHG is credited to the couple3. go for agreement of lease  pay 20% downpayment.correct?,btohqsg
Should be  but mine is staggered downpayment scheme,btohqsg
HLE application is in no 3?,btohqsg
So is 5% for the 3rd appointment,btohqsg
Mine is 5% at sign lease and 5% at key collection,btohqsg
ah! great! my cpf savings wont be depleted üëÄ,btohqsg
you can opt at the signing of lease?,btohqsg
this is outdated also  now its 5% and 15% from 30 Sep 2022 onwards,btohqsg
you‚Äôre automatically opted in if you meet the eligibility,btohqsg
oh yea I saw the HDB info Web liao,btohqsg
If youre below 30 no need scared. Hahahaha,btohqsg
it says the younger applicant though. so should be fine.,btohqsg
but i'm more interested in whether at the first stage is the EHG disbursed?,btohqsg
no EHG is disbursed later on,btohqsg
Hi does anyone knows how the deferred income works after I got a number from the balloting? ( things like - When do we present our students/ns certification),btohqsg
KHV. collecting keys soon. By Q1,btohqsg

Is it during the flat booking? Thanks for replying!,btohqsg
yes  first appt is booking of flats,btohqsg
So Emily  do they need to bring student card for first appt?,btohqsg
My friend wants to apply BTO but still student also,btohqsg
So that means around Mar you can collect keys liao,btohqsg
should be  my PCD is end feb by right,btohqsg

Some of my project the blocks also receive Liao,btohqsg
You mean hle letter or key? üòÇ,btohqsg

Hi I got a queue #30 to pick a flat next month .... just wondering if not taking loan when will they ask for the full sum of the flat?,btohqsg
Oh that means 5 years later then need to pay... so next month need to pay anything?,btohqsg
Depends u take how many room,btohqsg
Can only pay by nets i think,btohqsg
Then when u sign lease  they will reimburse you back the option fee,btohqsg
Mine was about a few months after the option fee,btohqsg
the reimburse of option fees no more already,btohqsg
the last batch reimburse is was for 2020 november bto projects,btohqsg
if want confirm check with hdb,btohqsg
Hi all. Anyone have plantation grove group chat?,btohqsg
Hi. I want to ask  hdb put key collection 2nd quarter of 2024 but btohq put my top completion 1 sept 2023. Mine is greenglade btw  kinda confused here,btohqsg
anyone know if income ceiling is assessed at time of application means when we pay $10 to apply for the ballot or when we book the flat?,btohqsg
Anyway anyone here is in Tampines Greenglade?,btohqsg
When you apply the bto  not the flat selection,btohqsg
Thats why they ask for your income,btohqsg
ahh ic.. i confused because at point of ballot  they never ask for verification  purely just declaration.. not like HLE when they asked for verification documents..,btohqsg
Hi guys! I am trying to upload my additional documents for my HLE application  but this keeps popping up üôÅ anyone knows why or how to fix it?,btohqsg
U try get to stable network to try,btohqsg
Called HDB and this is what they suggested  did it but the forbidden page still pops up for most HDB pages - apparently this is common for Google Chrome and Safari (according to the HDB person). The final solution I got was to google the specific link/ page I'm trying to go to  and click the page from Google Search : ) it worked but its super tedious.. just a heads up for others who may come across the same issue üôÇ,btohqsg
I use to work in so call government link organization. It is not the system garbage. It is due to the fact they want security and accountability . That why they design this way instead of usability . A upgrade cycle is always outside the commercial norm and end up the system look weird,btohqsg
Eg an upload file system will build as pull system outside the main system to avoid hacking etc . I spend a long time to figure this out as a non it person,btohqsg
Hi guys whats the diff between probable completion date ans estimated delivery posession date?,btohqsg
Probable completion date is most likely give u the keys.Delivery possession date is die die must give u the key liao.If not hdb will compensate u,btohqsg

can i check if credit score matters if I‚Äôm taking HDB loan?,btohqsg
They ask for credit bureau report. I would think yes  it matters.,btohqsg
Must pay to get the report?,btohqsg
you can get it free if you apply for new credit cards,btohqsg
Is it when u apply for hle? When i applied for hle for my flat selection appt they nv ask me for it,btohqsg
usually credit bureau report is required if you‚Äôre self employed or you‚Äôre a business owner,btohqsg
Oic‚Ä¶ im a salaried employee with cpf contributions,btohqsg
Thank you for the clarification ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Because I got confused with the credit bureau ü•≤ cause when I apply bto that time they did not ask for this documentation ü§£,btohqsg
That one need pay $5 right,btohqsg
so if salaried with cpf means no need credit report lah,btohqsg
if they never ask for it from you  then means no need,btohqsg
i just scared if i sign up for a credit card right before loan assessment then my score will be lower,btohqsg
signing up for a credit card will not affect your credit score unless you recently apply for more than 1 credit card,btohqsg
yeah cause i did that and my score was damn shit üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Which project are you looking at?,btohqsg
hi. i'm new here. i'm quite noob in property so i have some qns to ask. hope the community in this tele can enlighten me abit üòÖso my mum is 65 & she wants to downsize from 4R to 2R. i was wondering if she buy 2R unit  can she also apply for SBF? or strictly bto 2R flexi unit?,btohqsg
Sale of balance is essentially the leftover BTO units. You may only apply for BTO or SBF at the same launch. Does that answers your qn?,btohqsg
Just a quick question  from my understanding HLE for the HDB loan will get reviewed near key collection. I‚Äôve been told by a few hdb reps that the loan quantum can increase based on the increased income by then.Does anyone have any experience regarding this? Or know anyone who has encountered this situation?Am asking because as a full-time student  my income is not eligible for assessment hence our current loan is a lot lower right now. Just wanna try to see anyone has had similar experiences.,btohqsg
What length lease she want. If short lease will be different scheme. If senior flexi will have priority over others.,btohqsg
The chances are very different between senior flexi and just normal 2rm,btohqsg
oic. likely 30+ years of lease. it'll be just 2 of us. i'm in my 30s.,btohqsg
U also in the application? Or just occupier,btohqsg

But I think for elderly flat just her name alone is enough... Provided can pay one shot,btohqsg
ooh. don't mind me asking.. but normally how much shld she pay?,btohqsg
Refer to Financing the flat section,btohqsg
But do take note for elderly 2rm cannot sell in open market next time... must return to HDB. Whereas normal 99yr 2rm not under elderly scheme can sell in open market after 5 yrs MOP.,btohqsg
