How low you want the road tax to be   $83.1?,btohqsg
No Wonder stride taxi buy so many,btohqsg
the lowest roadtax in malaysia is RM20 a year,btohqsg
No offence la just that I find that below $1000 is very cheap alredy  donâ€™t need pump petrol and got 45 k reduction in purchase price,btohqsg
I saw most byd e6 on road these days . even private car,btohqsg
Spacious   good drive   big and cheap,btohqsg
But interior is really bad the e6,btohqsg
Iâ€™m used to paying $136 for red plate kia ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
But most bang for bucks pa,btohqsg
Yup SL auto bought alot.Comfort delgro also,btohqsg
ya exterior pretty decent looking for a ppl carrier,btohqsg
how much is it selling for?,btohqsg
I think 2 years time alot of taxi change to ev liao,btohqsg
Letâ€™s go tomorrow donâ€™t say no jiooo kin jiooooo,btohqsg
this is before the $700 flat add on road tax for evs that will kick in 2023,btohqsg
probably G way of taking back the petrol duties from EV owners,btohqsg
The government has to make back the taxes that they might lose on people switching from ICE to EVs,btohqsg
The rebates are just to get people to jump ship for now,btohqsg
After EVs something else with lower emissions will come about,btohqsg
And a similar cycle will repeat,btohqsg
yeah  make u jump ship first.. then slowly sharpen the blade,btohqsg
We all know what happened with governments promoting and condemning diesels,btohqsg
quite sad.. what is our country becoming?,btohqsg
Nice car in your profile picture sir!,btohqsg
now diesel same price as petrol... no wonder I see some companies switching to electric vans,btohqsg
Not just Singapore to be honest  this is happening all around the world,btohqsg
Patterns tend to be the same,btohqsg
Just that the frequency and stages differ,btohqsg
just an old coe car ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
i wished for a while  our cars can be pocket friendly without the dumb coe,btohqsg
Don't need the newest tech and designs for the best experience,btohqsg
Very well shown in this and many more videos,btohqsg
"One thing he said that really stuck with me is  ""usable power with all the sound and character""",btohqsg
provided that the mechatronics  coolant water pump  engine doesn't give headaches,btohqsg
If COE didn't exist  we would be in these,btohqsg
Have you had it from new or took over in the middle?,btohqsg
The mechatronics can be a pain especially if not maintained properly,btohqsg
from the 5 year mark. Now into it's 13th year,btohqsg
700 for 1 year of petrol fee leh,btohqsg
Don't like that  let it go down,btohqsg
Enjoy old cars while you can sir,btohqsg
Just curious  in the miraculous event that Coe crashes to $1  how does that benefit buyers who are not in the bid?,btohqsg
i would think that those not in the bid wont benefit,btohqsg
"mixing some psychology and economics  i would expect the next bidding to shoot up in price because everybody wants in to the ""$1"" coe so it will easily surpass the quota and cause a surge in coe price",btohqsg
But I think if everyone bid $1,btohqsg
The argument was better in my head,btohqsg
my dad got his 2008 car at $200,btohqsg
uh cat A also have before i think,btohqsg
it was a technical glitch i think,btohqsg
but the motorbike one was solely due to not enough bids,btohqsg
