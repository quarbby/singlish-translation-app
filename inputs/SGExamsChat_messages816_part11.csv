ngl iâ€™ve never seen anyone so vehemently against the whiteboard LOL,btohqsg
I have been against the whiteboard ever since ta nathan decided to do on whiteboard...(at which he changed to projector),btohqsg
"""Is it small?"" YES. IT. IS. (Not against nathan tho  he damn nice)",btohqsg
wait what was the issue exactly like he wrote very small or,btohqsg
I think he wrote what he thought was big  ended up being small,btohqsg

i think thereâ€™s pros and cons bc if use projector  itâ€™s hard to show the full steps then some parts end up getting scrolled past too quickly,btohqsg
