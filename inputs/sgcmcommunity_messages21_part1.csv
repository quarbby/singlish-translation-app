It different it a sports actually   you can do track   drag race and such activity for event,btohqsg
Yes. And I love watching them. All awesome cars to me man,btohqsg
Actually such is really a sport   just that too many ppl stereotypes as racing lol,btohqsg
I think the plans for this were scrapped due to lack of funds,btohqsg
Is it   hope they try again,btohqsg
no wonder some dont change oils even after one year. bmw also set the interval to one year or 12000km,btohqsg
Yea don't need to especially synthetic,btohqsg
Dino oil needs more frequent change.,btohqsg
the objective is to alwasy ensure moisture is removed.,btohqsg
cold places ok... but sg so freaking hot n start stop traffic... better to change often . oil is cheap,btohqsg
when you run engine you run hot and longer,btohqsg
and if engine is not used for a long time  oil remains okay still.,btohqsg
that is what the video is about. even after one year.,btohqsg
of course when you use it in start stop traffic it is bad for engine.,btohqsg
Thing about engine is that  it requires consistent running as compared to mothball for a long time. Technically EV is able to hibernate for longer period of time and kicks alive when needed.ICE vs EV is much like comparing Ink Jet printers VS Laser printers,btohqsg

It is the norm that Caltex and Shell are always ahead in pricing trends,btohqsg
Why u no join investment 🥸,btohqsg
There is a serious lack of transparency and monitoring on the prices! When oil prices are Low  consumers don’t get to enjoy citing high operating cost. Therefore  who can verify and trust what oil companies claimed?,btohqsg
but salmon from 38 per unit become 48 per unit liao,btohqsg
30% increase is the new norm,btohqsg

Malaysia really heavily subsidized the petrol lol,btohqsg
Our useless garmen only know how to suk money out of us,btohqsg
Actually to be fair our petrol price is not the highest and no reason to subsidize as we got no such resource and very good public transport,btohqsg

Subsidized fuel is only a part of the population only and not towards the needy   a lot of family got problem meeting end meet with no cars   I think these are the priorities la,btohqsg
