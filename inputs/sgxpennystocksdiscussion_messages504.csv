Moya notch bad but anticipated result right,btohqsg
Sgx probably the only exchange in the world that permits half yearly reporting.Very difficult to judge if there is any improvement base on q to q.Very misleading and some may get trap,btohqsg

ST News Night: 'Pump and dump' stock-buying scams on the rise in Singaporehttps://www.straitstimes.com/multimedia/st-news-night-pump-and-dump-stock-buying-scams-on-the-rise-in-singapore,btohqsg
Hoping the dividend they are giving ($0.0125) will invite a play.Results decent only. Profitable but no growth. Let‚Äôs see how they open.,btohqsg
based on comparison of 1H21 and FY20  2H20 made approx 19m and 1H21 made approx 21m  slight improvement.EBITDA of FY20 is 93m and 2H20 is almost 47m1H21 came at 54m  a significant improvementwhy the highlight and significance of EBITDA in moya result always?an online suggestion:EBITDA is used to find out the profitability of a company  while the net profit calculates the earnings per share of a company. ... Many businesses focus on measuring EBITDA because it minimizes the impact of factors outside of their scope of control and focuses on what can be controlledMoya holds service concession assets of 448m on their books which is essentially the value of the BOT business. They will be amortised over the life of the concession which are all non-cash in nature hence the significance of the EBITDA shows a clearer picture of their real earnings abilities,btohqsg
They have repaid 24m over the past 6 months.,btohqsg
their cashflow statementtheir OCF comes in 39  better than HY20interest payment saved 3m due to reduction of debt significantly. Debt is reducing well and saving on interest.Reminds of Del Monte  high debt but manageable  cash cow business improving margins over the years,btohqsg
#Moya#commentaryimpt points to note: 1st paragraph. Their new water treatment plant of 1000 lps is completed in 1H21  meaning the full contribution will be reflected in 2H212nd part in green is the key highlight. Their acquisition of Acuatico few years back has got few remaining years of concession in Jakarta and if renewed will give clear cashflow and profitability for next 20-25 years depending on the concession terms. A potential gamechanger and revaluation catalystlastly is their temporary operation of the water supply in Batam. They took over from a JV of sembcorp who was prominent in Batam from their JV with Salim via Gallant Venture. The transition has been extended to a year and i presume a confirmation of a long term concession will be awarded to Moya in time to come. Afterall  to displace Sembcorp is no mean feat,btohqsg
next part on their reliability and hence showcasing their capability to bring clean water to a massive population.Their search for opportunities.... await updates thenall in all i see a respectable set of results from Moya and as of now they are still trading below NAV.With full contribution of new plant (small one) and the Batam potential long term concession  i will assume 2H to outperform 1H but assume status quo  full year result will come in at 42m SGD net profit and market cap of Moya now stand at 306.8m  translating to a PE of 7.3,btohqsg
Nice coverage by Bro@furion07on Moya Asia.,btohqsg
US market to moon.Hope tomorrow we all Huat,btohqsg
All financial results seem promising .Hope tomorrow gap up,btohqsg
CSE global shows a break out and up of APEX channel.Results is out  profitable but nothing too spectacular IMO. Nevertheless  the dividends of $0.0125 that they are giving might lead to some play tomorrow.(Note: they have given $0.015 dividends earlier this year too  which brings their dividends for this FY to about 5% yield.)Anyways  Let‚Äôs see how it goes tomorrow and good luck holders. üôèüèª,btohqsg

Pika World Daily Update 12 August 2021Equity Markets Soak in OptimismThe Dow and S&P 500 set another record close on Wednesday as investors relieved the inflation data.Consistent with our analysis  the US Senate had approved the $3.5 trillion budget resolution  which will open the key to tapping onto the budget reconciliation framework to push through the ‚Äúhuman infrastructure‚Äù bill.As we have set eyes on European markets  it continues to do well. The STOXX 600 index was up 0.4%  with France‚Äôs CAC up 0.6% as Carrefour rose sharply by 2.5% after it announced plans to consider selling away its Taiwan unit. The FTSE also increased by 0.8%.Pika World continues to favour European equities to broaden the breadth of our portfolio as the US entered into the mid-cycle transition phase.Weaker Inflation but BewareThe much-anticipated consumer price data rose less than expected after a fierce rise in June. However  inflation data is still relatively high since 2008. Thus  the latest reading essentially meets Wall Street‚Äôs estimates. Moreover  car inflation increases have started to moderate  consistent with Pika World‚Äôs estimate that the inflexion point of peak inflation should be on the horizon.Tesla‚Äôs Deliveries Isn‚Äôt A Concern as YetThe delivery data shows that Tesla delivered 8600 cars in China  a substantial drop from the previous month. Based on data from The Chinese Passenger Car Association shipments detail  Tesla delivered around 33 000 from its Shanghai factory  of which 24 300 were exported.While some investors were concerned  Pika World remains confident of Tesla‚Äôs future. The data  while it seems surprised  is consistent with Tesla usual delivery pattern. Recall the data in April where Tesla delivered about 26 000 cars  of which 12 000 is for the local Chinese markets while 14 000 is exported. By June  we see that Tesla had around 33 000 vehicles  of which only 5000 is shipped  and 28 000 is for China market.Such a trend shows that Tesla often appears to export a large volume of cars in the early quarter and move towards more local delivery towards the end of the quarter. This strategy is perhaps logical given that shipment overseas required more time and documentation; thus  prioritising overseas shipments is likely wise.Coinbase Earnings a Spectacular PerformanceThe company easily top estimates as sales and profits were well ahead of Wall Street‚Äôs estimate. In addition  it shows that the trading volume and transaction revenue continued to drive top and bottom-line growth. More importantly  the monthly transaction users rose to 8.8 million from 6.1 million  a bright spot among the result.The outlook has some dull points  given that trading volume was weak when Bitcoin had a significant fall in July. However  the August volume seems to return as Bitcoin prices recovered but are still lower than seen in the early part of the year.Given the mixed results  Pika World continued to remain constructive on the stock with mild accumulation as the results were a mixed outlook but beat on the earnings result.What‚Äôs on the Menu Today?We have another piece of essential data.At 8.30 pm  we will welcome the PPI data  which is expected to rise 0.6% after a sharp rise of 1.0% in the prior period.At 1 am  we will also have the 30-Year Bond Auction.It is 12 August  Thursday  8.05 am in Singapore and 8.05 pm in New York.

Singtel posts S$445m Q1 net profit  reversing year-ago loss1. SINGTEL swung into the black with a net profit of S$445 million for the first quarter ended June 30  compared with a net loss of S$20 million a year ago on the back of improved operating and business environment with the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.2. Revenue growth was mainly driven by Singtel's Australian consumer business  where its operating revenue grew by 7.7 per cent to S$1.7 billion  from S$1.6 billion a year ago due to an 11 per cent appreciation of the Australian dollar. Assuming a constant exchange rate  operating revenue for the Australian consumer business fell 2.6 per cent.3. In July  the company announced plans for NCS to recast the subsidiary as a pan-Asian business-to-business digital services provider to drive further growth in the enterprise and telco sectors in the region.Source link in headerMore here,btohqsg
