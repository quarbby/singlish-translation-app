good psle score -> good sec sch -> good o levels most likely,btohqsg
bc poly requires you to work as a group,btohqsg
while O levels is a solo thing,btohqsg
You can rote learn o levels and do extremely well but psle is not such case,btohqsg
so if good sec sch doesnt matter  then psle is the deciding factor isnt it,btohqsg
I never even had tution since I was born,btohqsg
