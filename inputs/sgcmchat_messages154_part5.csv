I think people are expecting too much of a COE drop when the supply goes up. The peaks are gettting higher  and the bottoms are getting higher too. Whereas last time COE is like 20k or whatever at its cheapest  i think the lowest we see in the future would be like 50k or something which is still crazy expensive,btohqsg
And I see so many phv like getgo  bluesg and etc,btohqsg
It will drop once people those people who can't afford that pricing,btohqsg
Then cars will be for those will off individuals who can pay 150> for 1.6>cc,btohqsg
Nope trust me it will never drop back to 50k,btohqsg
People who are using Rentals are the reason coe is going up,btohqsg
Exactly we might not even get to 50k,btohqsg
