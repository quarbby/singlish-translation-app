isnt it normal when theywash car,btohqsg
i dun get tyre shine. just a gimmick. tyres u want design is stick sticker,btohqsg
Some tyres look 'dry' n dirty after wash,btohqsg
Personally  it's just make it look shiny for a while. Doesn't do much apart from looks. Save money and spend on something else. I don't use it. Only car detailing wash uses it  Frankly  it's just external look.,btohqsg
i always prefer having a nice coat of paint,btohqsg
Then put tyre shine to make it look black n new,btohqsg
invest the $$ in better tyres,btohqsg
