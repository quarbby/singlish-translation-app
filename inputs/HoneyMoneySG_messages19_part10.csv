insurance only clocks to the $500 card spend for the purpose of uob one bonus interest  does not clocks to card rebate. So does not matter uob evol or uob one card.,btohqsg
not sure what u mean  there are a whole long list of exclusions for the $500 card spend for uob one account bonus  interest. Insurance is the one of the very few exception that clocks to bonus interest  other exclusions on uob one card also applies to uob one account card spend for bonus interest.,btohqsg
Juat Wait lor since u already approved it's a matter time,btohqsg
So u meaning for the uob1 acc spend of $500  for insurance doesn’t matter I charge to evol or uob1 credit card.,btohqsg
you mean evol gives cashback for insurance? that's good to know.,btohqsg
or you mean insurance only counted to meet the minimum spend?,btohqsg
Dude... I think this is only for maybank. Not suited for other banks yea?,btohqsg
it should be a common standard to generate the QR. there are many other ready made generators - you can Google. I can't paste link as it's deleted by bot.,btohqsg
Insurance only can meet uob1 acc criteria for spending but not uob1 card criteria of spending. Hope that clarify.,btohqsg
Anyone know if uob1 credit card if u can’t hit the $500 spending then what will the cash back be? Cause understand if u hit $500 spending monthly will entitle for quarterly rebate. But if can’t hit $500 spending then will the cash back still be at 3.33% or will it be like 0.3%?,btohqsg
If u low spender get Maybank is not bad too 3.33%https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-platinum-visa-card.page?sc=acq2&utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=platvisa&utm_term=broad&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7bucBhCeARIsAIOwr-_GhIMvhtlN6RkBe_zzINVOStAUlXyH1V9GLH7qdy6IVq2DcKDPtpoaAtRIEALw_wcB,btohqsg
so if I use UOB One card to pay insurance  I can get the bonus interest for the savings account right? that's nice to know.,btohqsg
Simply spend a minimum of S$300 every month for each quarter and get up to S$100 cashback!For Maybank,btohqsg
not bad.. $300x3 get back $30 at least is 3.33%,btohqsg
ideal if already have recurrent payments that you can control to only spend $300 per month.,btohqsg
Take note only apple & Samsung pay supported,btohqsg
else if one month accidentally miss will become BBQ lor  like the  UOB one card,btohqsg
300$ per month is much easy to meet,btohqsg
then no good. I was thinking maybe phone bill. then cannot already.,btohqsg
the troublesome part is the monthly effort to make sure exceed $300 slightly only to maximise cashback.,btohqsg
Not surely if utility id excluded,btohqsg
next year need to rethink of strategy. many changes recently to card and bank terms.,btohqsg
Best simple go card is now still SCb smart,btohqsg
But can this be tag with any card? To achieve more cash back?,btohqsg
Grab Revo amazing all nerf or not allowed,btohqsg
Don't expect to double triple dip like before,btohqsg
Oh well If u consider this as a double dipAdd to Samsung pay earn point cum Maybank 3.33%,btohqsg
the good old days mostly gone now. haha,btohqsg
I'm earing from amex TCB & grab & Samsung pay,btohqsg
the best of the best was the initial beginning when even pay income tax earn grab points,btohqsg
Triplets dip beforehand now onky Samsung pay and card point,btohqsg
tcb and grab I can't use already max for the year. next month can again.,btohqsg
Just prepared more nerf next year if economy take hit maybe our amex & grab no more Cashback,btohqsg
Load singoass app on phone lor,btohqsg
just apply until they ask you to verify using singpass?,btohqsg
yes I think amex nerf is next,btohqsg
Just prepared to apply a new cc to replace kor,btohqsg
hi  since we can top up revolut with apple pay  we can add amex true cashback and top up for 1.5% right?,btohqsg
Revo not support amex too top,btohqsg
Revo only support bank/ visa / Master,btohqsg
Take notes Visa too up will incurred fee soon,btohqsg
haiz  ic thanks. thought finally found a work around,btohqsg
I called  cimb before on applying the infinite card without meeting the 120 k annual income. It is not about 50 k in fast saver. You need to put one year FD (not 18 mths) and must cancel the credit card before withdraw fd accordingly to the staff. Was told such FD must place in branch personally. I suspect they make you sign some documents to use the FD fund if you don't pay your credit cardbills. Anyone has more details can share? Don't know if I should apply card first or go bank first.,btohqsg
Don't worry bank already know all the hack's to excluded all benefits to us haha,btohqsg
how you plan to maximise the infinite card?,btohqsg
Anyone can clarify if i still get 10x rewards if i use amaze + citi rewards at watsons  guardian  decathalon  tog game shop  cold storage?,btohqsg
hi does anyone know about the current cimb referral programme? i was trying to create a CIMB FastSaver account and they asked for a referral and a promo code,btohqsg
I have read the terms n conditions. Telco paid online and water electric paid thru sp app would count towards hitting the $300 per month?,btohqsg
I could not get an accurate answer from American Express.I have spent $7500 so far.My 1st $5000 was spent on grab top up. The subsequent $2500 was on online purchases.Does it mean that I have fully Utilise the 3% cashback promotion cap but only gotten 1.5%?Example1st $5000 (grab top up) = 1.5%$5001 to $7500 (online purchase) = 1.5%1.5 % forfeited?,btohqsg
