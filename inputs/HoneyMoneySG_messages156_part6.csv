They reduce in Feb every year and increase in March 😅,btohqsg
Hi guys  am trying out ibkr buy order.. Is the comm and fee right?,btohqsg
Less money cannot   more money close eye 🙃,btohqsg
Which credit card still gives cash back for health insurance premium payment?,btohqsg
So choc only axs affected  how about direct bill payment 🤔,btohqsg
Ya it's frustrating to realise that gpay cannot link Maybank cards. What shd I do? 😤,btohqsg
Stick the card to the back of your phone?,btohqsg
Ya... Beforehand was using Samsung phone so still can Samsung pay  or at most Amaze + fnf pairing just for gpay. But now amaze nerfedProbably last option is juz bring card le (or buy a cheap Samsung phone just for payment if rly dw bring card 🤡),btohqsg
the samsung phone probably costs more than the 1% amaze fee for the lifespan of the device 😂,btohqsg
Hi guys. Did axs just nerfed the chocolate card payment ? No longer can pay axs bills using credit card option,btohqsg
Hi everyone  does anyone knows how the interest for esaver works? When will interest be credited into esaver account? As of today  I have yet to receive. I deposited $ on 3 feb 25 and then withdraw all out on 6 feb 25. By right should get 3 days interest right? Pls enlighten me. Thanks,btohqsg
So cannot use chocolate card at all for debit or credit payment on axs anymore ?,btohqsg
This is the Public Promo.they will compare February ADB with January ADB  and the fresh funds portion will earn the bonus interest as mentioned.Bonus interest credited latest by 20th March 2025 for your February balances.,btohqsg
If I link chocolate card for regular insurance premium payment  does that still qualify for max miles ?,btohqsg
That being said  those on Marathon Esaver Bonus  got their Bonus Interest credited for 5th March 2025.,btohqsg
like this  will you all be using chocolate card on cardup or other alternative CC like UOB Priv Miles,btohqsg
Cc bill can be paid via giro to HSBC ega for 1% cashback. Thats a factor for me not considering choco card for cardup.,btohqsg
Is it worth to use citi payall - citi premiermiles to pay for insurance premiums? is there a cap monthly?,btohqsg
not worth now  pay via cardup instead,btohqsg
Guys  I notice that a lot of hawker stalls and coffeeshop stalls accept amex as payment as seen in their QR code. Is this correct ? Does it mean that it makes sense to have an amex to pay for all these ?,btohqsg
yes if there are no better options,btohqsg
to be clear  it is AMEX PAY.. so you need to install/enable this on the amex app..not use your amex physical card,btohqsg
Hi  I have a question for using CardUp to pay for income tax. If I already have an existing GIRO plan on IRAS to pay monthly  then I set up CardUp to pay for subsequent monthly payments. If I setup the payment date correctly  IRAS will see the remaining balance for the month that my card up transaction was successful as $0?Based on what I understand from reading:https://milelion.com/2023/07/22/giro-income-tax-can-you-make-ad-hoc-payments-without-double-deductions/,btohqsg
On top of what Mt said  it must be AMEX ISSUED card. Not AMEX network card.,btohqsg
When you setup CardUp  all the instructions are there. Just follow won't go wrong. But do note that this month's payment is for next month's.,btohqsg
for a first credit card to earn miles  would you apply for Citi Rewards or UOB PP?,btohqsg
What are you going to use it for?,btohqsg
Uob PP. Citi rewards don’t cover offline dining,btohqsg

Need to double check with all the gurus here.I need to charge $4700 thereabout next week online for MCC 7311. No restriction to charge it to CRMC directly to get 10X points right? No need to split cards payments right?,btohqsg
CRMC is only $1k per month,btohqsg

I thot if I paired with Amaze  its cap is at $1K per month but since it’s an online payment  I’m using CRMC directly instead. Am I still subject to $1k cap?,btohqsg
both have $1k cap just different cycles.after nerf  amaze cap is no longer relevant,btohqsg
Got some dp saying yes but also got 1 kenna cash advance fee.,btohqsg
very normal...different banks use different assessment criteria.. not just your proven income amount.1. type of employment2. industry3. other approved limits4. credit history5. length of employment6. others (won't be made public),btohqsg
Thanks! Does no one here use amex pay for hawker and coffee shop  ever since Xnap got removed?,btohqsg
