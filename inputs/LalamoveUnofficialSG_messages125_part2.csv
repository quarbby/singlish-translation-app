Ignore the bar  it's a psychological thing to keep you taking more jobs,btohqsg

Ohh really ha ? You know why your feeling this kinda way cause other people wouldn't waste their time and talk cock here and just work ! If your not happy with the facts that your not getting any orders! You should wake up earlier and take up coming orders as well you fool,btohqsg
Speaking of which can the $75 be refunded or not ah,btohqsg
Donâ€™t know if anyone notice but llm CS looks like donâ€™t have a specified SOP,btohqsg
Just encountered an order drop off in Lalamove map is matrichie reservoir but the address is Fernvale. Live chat with the cs and they gave me a new order. Old order is $30 because of high demand surcharge but new order $21 without high demand. I live chat again and told another agent about this and he told me itâ€™s based on the system they cannot add the fee then he end the chat. I live chat again but with another agent. He able to add for me the high demand surcharge. Really Alibaba CS,btohqsg

If I top up min 20 dollars into my wallet using dbs  how long will it update the new amount in my wallet? Instantaneously or need to wait few days?,btohqsg
Last I did top up  8 days ago. It took 15 mins. Share with us your experience so that drivers here can agak-agak also. Since itâ€™s not a fixed amount of timing I suppose. ðŸ¤”,btohqsg

Many don't want to take coz no job come out. Must factor your petrol cost out,btohqsg

Call beforehand  ask for picture if unsure. Once you go down you already lost out on time and petrol.,btohqsg
