HI everyone saw something rather interesting that is in the news in thailand  vietnam  hong kong.New company selling property differently. They claim you name the price...It seems to make money at different levels1. investor bid down the price of the property by naming your price. If the seller is okay  you get it2. If you recommend your friend and he buys  some properties will pay out referral to you3. No MLM however but at least its one level down.https://bit.ly/3kud8Oc,btohqsg
