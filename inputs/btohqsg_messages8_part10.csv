Basically they count based on whichever is worse for you ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
does it matter whether you put both applicant or 1 applicant 1 occupier?,btohqsg
means if next time the occupier buy second property  no absd?,btohqsg
If occupier has never owned any property before  including the BTO  then the next property he/she buys is considered first property,btohqsg
Thank you Hao Long for clarifying! :),btohqsg
People usually do this to avoid the 12% ABSD  which is usually a condo as second property priced at least $1m. Imagine having to pay 120k extra ðŸ™‚ but this is not everyone's cup of tea.,btohqsg
Just have to hope that the rules don't change,btohqsg
If you alrdy applied BTO or sign lease  I don't think it will affect because legally the occupant does not own the flat. Some side effects include:- sole owner has the full right to sell the house.- if divorced without children  both parties must relinquish the flat bought under the married couple scheme. In this case  sole owner becomes second-timer while occupier remains first-timer (based on HDB definition).,btohqsg
Just in case if you are buying BTO again after selling your private property  there is a wait out period of 30 months,btohqsg
Have to rent a place for 2.5 years before applying for BTO,btohqsg
Then another 5 years of rental,btohqsg

@SebasSebSebasSebisit I can buy portable router insert sim only. For home wifi.,btohqsg
U need to check with the telco.From my understanding  some Telco block the use of sim card in portable router.I try before last time when they offer unlimited 3G data.My portable router doesn't work  but the data works on my phone.So double check first.,btohqsg
But generally this theory works :D,btohqsg
But bear in mind  portable router with sim signal definitely lose to standard home base router.There is a maximum number of connection also.I would say anything more than 3 people connecting to your portable router  u cannot surf anything.,btohqsg
Only I 1 person use to work from home.,btohqsg
Then should be ok. Weigh the cost lo.,btohqsg
Unlimited data usually have a cap.,btohqsg
Anything after the cap ur speed will slowwwwww like snail,btohqsg
@SebasSebSebasSebok thanks thanks considering sign 100gb sim only and get the portable router,btohqsg
Yup! Now the data quite a lot. If you use alone  very useful. But actually u don't need portable wifi. Just put it into a phone   turn on hotspot can already. I find the market for portable wifi not v good. Not many company are manufacturing. Those manufacturing are probably doing it for the sake of taking the market share. I would suggest use a mobile phone.,btohqsg
How long does it usually take for the result of the cpf housing grant.... its been already more thn 2months since i applied and selected my flat,btohqsg
Depends on individual. No estimated time to be exact. Cos if your documents provided is missing something or if HDB needed further clarification  for example they asking you what is this allowance for?  On a side note  HDB got lots of back log too.They might ask u for company letter to explain.  Cos this happen to me,btohqsg
If u really want to know when approve  only way is to call them and ask them to expedite,btohqsg
Ya can be that long too. Mine I got my result only after I called and asked them to expedite. Otherwise  I think I also waiting still,btohqsg
They will send an email to tell u its approved ? Or ?,btohqsg
That time when i select flat the hdb person told me around 1 month can know liao. If never contact us can call hdb or the person incharge stated in one of the many papers given to u during flat selection,btohqsg

You and your partner's particulars and latest basic pay for 3 months (Aug to Oct  for Nov launch),btohqsg
Apply for DIA during flat selection,btohqsg
It's July now  when did you get your HLE?,btohqsg
Take note that the option fee will form part of the down-payment  meaning you won't be getting back like previously,btohqsg
Only if his partner graduated in the last 12 months before application,btohqsg
If still studying  still eligible right,btohqsg
Means one must not be working to eligible for DIA,btohqsg
