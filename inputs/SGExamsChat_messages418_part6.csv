hes a decade older my g,btohqsg
13 14 IS foetus for him,btohqsg
Any 13 or 14 is fetus to me,btohqsg
Now when people say they born post 2k,btohqsg
it's just saying we look like a child,btohqsg
I went to shower. You still havenâ€™t answered my questions. >:(,btohqsg
Do you talk a lot too then?,btohqsg
I really feel like doing a Mr Physics series,btohqsg
You just gave me an idea of where you live. ðŸ‘€,btohqsg
Mr Physics' Summary NotesG3 Physics- Read and understand quickly before exams,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t that your nickname for him,btohqsg
coconut flavoured ice cream served in a coconut shell  topped with fresh coconut shavings,btohqsg
That outlet exists? I didnâ€™t even know the merchandise chain existed until now.,btohqsg
Pro tip  dont think of Starbucks as a coffee  think of it as a liquid dessert,btohqsg
in case any one helping juniors with Physics  do note that there's a major wording change for conservation of energy,btohqsg
It's about energy stores  and a transfer of energy stores from one store to another,btohqsg
I'm still reading up on how it's taught and need more time to update notes,btohqsg
textbook is out in popular bookshop if anyone interested,btohqsg
it's a major change as it affects thermal energy  electrical energy  and even nuclear energy,btohqsg
expecting 2025 A level Physics to change syllabus to accommodate this,btohqsg
I love the old definition >:(,btohqsg
apparently the change started elsewhere in the world earlier,btohqsg
I'll read up and then help handle questions in the O/N group,btohqsg
Oh my gosh  my leg is still numb from the chronic nerve pain of sitting down too long earlier.,btohqsg
Energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only be transferred from one store to another. The total energy of an isolated system remains constant.,btohqsg
we have to move with the times,btohqsg
double insulation changed to earthed metal casing,btohqsg
my time we used this.Then they change to double insulation.Then they change it back again now,btohqsg
I haven't look through it deeper,btohqsg
but no more transfer of thermal energy,btohqsg
wah one of the authors of the new textbook was my physics lecturer in JC,btohqsg
Someone just told me that they find coding a de-stressing relaxant.,btohqsg
I look forward to the day that I can successfully say that efficiently.,btohqsg
and you  mr physics  are also an author of a book !,btohqsg
differentthough I did help in one of the NA science textbook for Physics before,btohqsg
edited all the mistakes of the author,btohqsg
not everyone in this world will edit textbook  or even publish their own book  considering u n Arnold have done it  it's considered admirable,btohqsg
was paid $500 for 2 days work. Quite low  but helping friend,btohqsg
Textbook need PhD to write.I can only write guidebooks. Because gave up my PhD.,btohqsg
time to call out@kohsyanboth of y'all go work tgt,btohqsg
No leh. The author is the same since 20 years ago,btohqsg
u need MOE approval for it,btohqsg
You my how many years senior haha,btohqsg
Oh cheh saw you mentioned your JC phys lecturer just now,btohqsg
My JC lecturer was Joan Fong,btohqsg
if she is one of the authors  it's worth a read,btohqsg
I like how two people tagged me to write textbook after Jun Wei say need PhD,btohqsg
weird though to need one imo,btohqsg
it's more of a proof of ability,btohqsg
of course I think my own notes are better though,btohqsg
