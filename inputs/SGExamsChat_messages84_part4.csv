The height refers to what here,btohqsg
It's your question haha  I can't answer it out of context,btohqsg
Combine all u get ur equation,btohqsg
This is for fluids of course,btohqsg
No im asking for the h in the m = density*h*A,btohqsg
Height of the column of fluid lor,btohqsg
The fluid one is the height from the surface to object,btohqsg
If that’s what you’re referring to,btohqsg
Non fluid that formula dont hold,btohqsg
I talking about m = den*A*h,btohqsg
You imagine having a block of wood with base area A and a height h,btohqsg
What is mass? Volume x density right  then the force exerted by some mass is Vρg,btohqsg
But when you talk about the force exerted by a fluid at some depth h on some area A  only the fluid directly above that area exerts a force on it  so Vρg = hAρg,btohqsg
Cuz the fluid in question is just a column,btohqsg
The density refers to density of fluid right,btohqsg
@UnderscoreNeilDotSu seem ready for ur course,btohqsg
am i supposed to know density of water,btohqsg
So what is the density HAHAH,btohqsg
Hahaha no i on 4th topic only aftee 2 weeks,btohqsg
You rmb 1 g cm^-3 also can,btohqsg
For this one wouldnt the faucet pressure be 0 coz height itself is 0,btohqsg
For that need the faucet pressure wad,btohqsg
The change in height is just 30?,btohqsg
The pressure in tank is straightforward,btohqsg
Faucet 0 so total change 30?,btohqsg
Idw post in alevels group coz this aint alevels,btohqsg
I think u post coding qn here more ppl can help,btohqsg
I can read documentation for it,btohqsg
Pressure due to water at the top is 0,btohqsg
Pressure due to water at the faucet is hρg where h is 30m,btohqsg
There’s no water above the water level in the tank right,btohqsg
Yeah so the height of water above that water level is 0,btohqsg
So the pressure acting at the top of the tank is 0,btohqsg
At the faucet  the water level above it is 30m  so the pressure there is 30ρg,btohqsg
So this one isP = Patmosphere + Pfaucet ?,btohqsg
Of the water in the tank?,btohqsg
How come no need consider piping,btohqsg
Cuz pressure is the same along the same level,btohqsg
I vaguely remember dalton law from h2 chem,btohqsg
I have no idea how i passed that topic,btohqsg
That topic got huge overlap with h2 phy,btohqsg
Not sure if this is the right place to ask but,btohqsg
Which is better  NTU or NUS Aerospace eng?,btohqsg
Nus aerospace eng is more of a specialisation,btohqsg
Ye I know ntu one is more specific,btohqsg
But aerospace industry is quite shit in Sg,btohqsg
They dont have much advantage over mechanical engine tbh,btohqsg
Although it is alot harder to enter the course,btohqsg
The pressure along the dotted line is the same,btohqsg
I’m having a lot of trouble deciding ;-;,btohqsg
