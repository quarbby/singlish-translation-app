does any one know if a PR is buying a resale flat as family nuclear with Singaporean  does he have to pay higher stamp duty?,btohqsg
not sure does it applies to resale,btohqsg
the 10k will be deducted from the housing price once converted to citizen,btohqsg
if its a matrimonial home shouldnt have ABSD  not sure for family nucleus.,btohqsg
"""If  as a foreigner or PR  you are married to Singaporean citizen and you don‚Äôt own any residential property currently  you don‚Äôt have to pay ABSD.""",btohqsg
my colleague  a PR recently has bought a condo with her PR hubby  ABSD 7%  she was lamenting 3% only for locals,btohqsg
I think that's BSD not ABSD? ABSD should be at least 12%,btohqsg
but these two BSD apply to HDB too?,btohqsg
BSD is stamp duty paid during lease signing,btohqsg
Hi anyone can tell me roughly how much $$ to prepare for the first appointment ? 3room sbf flat. I believe will be selecting unit ?,btohqsg
will be returned to you after your 2nd appointment,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be ‚Äúreturned‚Äù right? It‚Äôll go into your downpayment straight during second appt,btohqsg
it'll be returned to your bank account,btohqsg
2nd appointment only involves deduction from CPFOA unless you want to pay by NETS/cashier order,btohqsg
Oh so its like a deposit instead,btohqsg
unless you give up after the first appointment,btohqsg
I see . Ok thank you ü§ó,btohqsg
Depends on how u wanna pay for your downpayment and stamp duty . If you're paying by fully by cpf then the option fee will be returned. If not the option fee will be used to offset.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm paying fully by CPF  but officer said it goes to our downpayment. It‚Äôs also stated in the HDB website it goes to the downpayment,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so right? It was told that it‚Äôs gonna be straight to downpayment,btohqsg
Hmm that‚Äôs weird  cause they told me non refundable when I asked,btohqsg
if u have enough OA  they will reimburse u the option fee. My option fee is reimbursed to me because i have more than enough OA,btohqsg
Ahh okie  cause I do have enough OA currently + I‚Äôve got grant too,btohqsg
Confirm refund. I just received my refund of option fee last mth or so only,btohqsg
if you took up an otp  can you decide to proceed with a second one? Does buyer have to also wait 21 days?,btohqsg
Hello! Can I have new family/newly wed who apply for bto/SBF how many grants are there for us ?,btohqsg
resale.anyone knows?Buyer wants to cancel otp  how go do in HDB resale portal,btohqsg
even if someone here is able to help you with this question  maybe you have another question in doubt,btohqsg
answer to the qn: buyer no need to cancel otp  he can accept more than 1 otp and valuation per HDB resale officer  buyer no nd to wait 21 days,btohqsg
Those who applied as applicant + occupier  any idea if the occupier is allowed to go for the signing of lease appointment?,btohqsg
They won't be so strict right  2 people should be ok?,btohqsg
no problem even if it's not occupier,btohqsg
my wife and I accompanied my mum to the selection exercise despite we are not occupiers,btohqsg
can Absd be paid by cpf?,btohqsg
Just to share  the interest for bank loan will also change very fast when economy pick upüôÇ,btohqsg
hello  given that the best interest rate these days is in CPF OA  would it make sense that to save up for BTO  instead of putting in a bank  to contribute more CPF as a Self-employed person?,btohqsg
I think it does  the only downside is once you sell  you need to put the money back in cpf oa and can't use that cash. Should be good though if you want to use it for another property in future but just less flexibility,btohqsg
never put all the eggs in the same basket!,btohqsg
yes indeed. i guess it also depends on what are the options and conditions of available baskets üòÖ,btohqsg
Yes very subjective for every family. But  it can still be a viable option for some.,btohqsg
Anyone bto Dakota breeze? Is there tele group?Or anyone have a PDF version of 4-room floorplan?,btohqsg
