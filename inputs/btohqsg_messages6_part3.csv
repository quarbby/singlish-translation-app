Haha maybe. How high is the project tho? Don't have 40+ storeys?,btohqsg
Really learning alot from you guys from this chat,btohqsg
Yes. Should be. It's directly behind AH,btohqsg
No la. The Queenstown project in Aug. No info yet right.,btohqsg
800m means you must know how to cut through the estates,btohqsg
that should be the shortest distance,btohqsg
I'm guessing it's the poster child development in the next launch,btohqsg
hard to estimate the date since the late launch of this may,btohqsg
wah Lao mai lah so far..... i lower my expectation to within 400m for nearest MRT  just like TB to TB MRT,btohqsg
if all are within 400m range  best lol,btohqsg
never been to the above hawkers despite I'm a native sinkie,btohqsg
Oh u should.. maybe when this covid measures loosen. Food is good there.,btohqsg
But still  can try ma haha,btohqsg
I was going to say might be overhyped lol,btohqsg
Got legit good food there at OAR hawker.,btohqsg
OARFC is 400m away to my BTO  7mins walk from doorstep  under the hot sun is no joke,btohqsg
True. That side I rmb is damn hot.,btohqsg
Exit mrt walk over at noon is like entering an oven,btohqsg
if only got mall within the proximity,btohqsg
envious of residents staying next to mall and MRT,btohqsg
never seen a man with umbrella under a hot sun lol,btohqsg
but ya agree with you  sg mid day sun no joke,btohqsg
maybe can petition to MP to build a sheltered walkway?,btohqsg
omg got my music playing behind,btohqsg
Only the traffic junction not sheltered,btohqsg
I go OAR always dk what to eat. Those with long queue I nvr try before ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I haven't tried the lor mee,btohqsg
always see got queue but when no queue  my wife did not want to try,btohqsg
I also haven't try. Usually eat the other one with shorter queue,btohqsg
The lor mee queue is damn siao one.,btohqsg
The queue can fight the line for 4r TB beacon,btohqsg
It's like when you stay there you won't really feel like queuing ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I'd love to try it someday,btohqsg
too bad the only vegetarian stall there not nice one,btohqsg
Fact.Because u will think  what's the rush? I'm so near it anyways.,btohqsg
Only if you travel far to a place then you'll feel like queuing since you alr spent time travelling haha,btohqsg
I forgot which satay stall  it's damn nice.,btohqsg
Inside one. I don't really know how to tell u haha,btohqsg
tiagong that's the only one  I'm not familiar with the hawker,btohqsg
The vegetarian stall changed 1-2 years back,btohqsg
Dk if yall referring to old or new one,btohqsg
o you stay there now ah@Laoclaw,btohqsg

Wait u talking about vegetarian or satay?,btohqsg
so it should be new one as per what you described,btohqsg
but yeah the satay is reasonably priced,btohqsg
my side food court sells at 80Â¢,btohqsg
