Is anyone using Maybank for day to day transactions Iike pay now or banking transfers?I have a human on Maybank who keeps getting tricked to pay now or transfer out from creditable account when there is sufficient funds from their savings account.Apparently in Maybank lite app  the default account selected is creditable account and you need to scroll your phone down manually to see the account being selected / change account.And the most stupid thing is you are able to proceed with the transfer without even sighting which is the account u are transferring out from.This has caused my human to be penalised with minimum $5 overdraft interest per month on a few instances just for paying friends say $10 for lunch.Very irritating and even when calling into Maybank the officer wasn‚Äôt able to provide a solution on how to set the default account to be a savings account and not a credit able account. Duh. Which idiot would transfer money out from credit able when they have money in savings account.Obviously an app design flaw or an intentional trap by Maybank.,btohqsg
If they look the same to you  you need better glasses üòÇ,btohqsg
The maybank lite app is trash.. it feels like it's made for kids or something,btohqsg
But they force u to use Maybank lite for paynow to friends.They intentionally disabled paynow on the main Maybank app.,btohqsg
The officer say until so easy.Oh u just have to make sure u choose the correct account before u paynow.But it defaults to creditable. How stupid is that.I think the only way out is to cancel credit able,btohqsg
Yes  insurance not excluded in T&Cs,btohqsg
Check the T&C see if it‚Äôs excluded,btohqsg
Hi guys  does the oneself transfer salary by paynow to uob one still works?,btohqsg
POSB / DBS excludes AMAZE* transactions so you won't earn any rewards  and the spread is worse.,btohqsg
Anyone has any SG stock market group to recommend,btohqsg
Does anyone buy those growth funds/income funds with monthly dividends payout? Any stable one to suggest?,btohqsg
Any good Earning system have for foreigner...  I always watch your video bro,btohqsg
Hi all  for UOB one savings  I have two UOB cards  UOB one and lady‚Äôs. I can meet the spending requirement of $500 using either one or need to specify? I used to use UOB one but now would like to concentrate my spending on lady‚Äôs.,btohqsg
no need to specify  once you hit on one you will hit the account requirements.,btohqsg

Thanks! Can I check the bonus spending category for my UOB lady‚Äôs,btohqsg

Has anyone here tried transferring FROM Maybank Malaysia bank account TO Maybank Singapore account? From website  there's no agent bank. Not sure about other fees and FX rate. Another alternative is Wise  I guess,btohqsg
I tried maybank msia to maybank sg. Not bad. Small fees is needed. Maybe fx rate not that good compared to you trip or ichange or money changer. It is just convenience to transfer in non cash method,btohqsg
