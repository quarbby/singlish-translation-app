Hey guys  question on pumping petrol in Malaysia,btohqsg
Today my first time pump petrol using credit card at caltex in JB,btohqsg
I remember I pump 34rm worth of petrol but my credit card was charged 200rm!!!,btohqsg
I found out from the bank that all petrol kiosk in MY charge 200 rm temporarily to our credit or debit card and then refund u back and charge u the exact amount u pump,btohqsg
Did any of u experience this when pumping petrol in MY?,btohqsg
No  most of us use cash,btohqsg
We go to counter pass them 100rm to open pump. Then you go pump how much you need  after pumped go to counter do you payment/refund.,btohqsg
He must be go counter ask to open pump kiosk,btohqsg
This is my first time and only discovered got such temporary charge for using credit card to pump petrol.,btohqsg
Nevertheless...should be able to get refund..just keep an eye on yiur bank statement,btohqsg
Nxt time go in yiu can use card to deduct after filling or pay via cash,btohqsg
to avoid holding fee  can give them your card. if you ok.they will open pump then when u r done go collect back card.,btohqsg
Use cash better bro. If want use card I would recommend go petronas  their pump kiosk got paywave machine  tap card then open pump. After pump they only charge you how much you pump. Nothing more.Petronas country wide all have paywave machine. Easy for us who don't carry much cash.Don't need go counter deposit rm to open pump kiosk  just at your pump kiosk tap card  will auto open,btohqsg
It's okay  everyone gets to learn,btohqsg
I very heart pain after seeing 200 fly away temporarily,btohqsg
It's like a deposit bro. No worries,btohqsg
The bank assured me they will refund the 200,btohqsg
Keep an eye on yiur Bank statement ..should be okie de,btohqsg
Nothing much to be worry about,btohqsg
Nxt time can jio us go petrol run..see anyone of us want go.anot,btohqsg
No worries  will surely revert back to u,btohqsg
It's just pre authorisation  not actual transaction,btohqsg
Caltex malaysia also do the same. I went to Caltec at Johor Jaya to pump today.,btohqsg
I tot pumping petrol in Singapore is as straightforward as in Malaysia,btohqsg
Malaysia don't why implement such unusual process,btohqsg
If got pump attendant more easier.,btohqsg
By the way.Pump petrol ok.Try not to wash car,btohqsg
Different country different way to doing things . Normal,btohqsg
I ask the pump attendant for help lor. She never tell me about 200rm pre authorization charge,btohqsg
Next time use youtrip debit card better,btohqsg
She think you might be regular,btohqsg
Car wash   cases of the washing guy willl slip in drugs into urs unknowingly..,btohqsg
Easy for them .Easy for the drug dealerEasy to locate ur car once u reach singapore,btohqsg
This 1 effort leh  need to track down ur car in sg,btohqsg
Personally no.But used to handle cases like that when I was in NS,btohqsg
Quite risky for them also  imagine u nvr return to sg for days,btohqsg
How to keep track of ur whereabout sia,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt need track u. They just have to follow u ..,btohqsg
Hahaha  customer in sg waiting. But you go genting play 1 week,btohqsg
They have their own way ba,btohqsg
Maybe they got put tracking device,btohqsg
Will u wash ur car before going Genting ?,btohqsg
If I feel like it lo.,btohqsg
This is real case real world,btohqsg
But also got chance it's an excuse once get caught ba. Just play victim card  but end of the day still kena charged,btohqsg
How often this case will happen?,btohqsg
Just be wary n all when washing cars in sg lo,btohqsg
They rather risk u den paying more to traffickers,btohqsg
Because too many people run away without paying,btohqsg
It's like airport also  but airport easier to track coz travelling by foot when exiting airport,btohqsg
Another thing learn from u all. Tks for sharing,btohqsg
Ahyoo.. not warning la. I just hope t share,btohqsg
Anyways  want wash super clean de can go temple of wash at@ishengjie,btohqsg
Ya Fred nxt time can bring yiu there for car wash,btohqsg
Shengjie don't drug traffic  he traffic himself,btohqsg
Ok üëçSteady .. I longing for a goood wash,btohqsg
He wash rim super clean  like mirror,btohqsg
He wash per car ard 2 hrs,btohqsg
This is the same with the 200rm holding isn't it?,btohqsg
Different. They charge you only on how much you pump,btohqsg
But do expect long waiting time.,btohqsg
Let me know when yiu wana go..can bring yiu there,btohqsg
Anyway  no need scare. I pump purely on credit card only. Every week,btohqsg
I checked my statement they nvr deduct 200rm,btohqsg
Pre authorise bro  won't deduct de,btohqsg
Sian  still so jam going out,btohqsg
I wan go in and see how u all pump with cash,btohqsg
Take it as a educational trip to JB,btohqsg
You just need to deposit cash at the payment counter and tell them your pump number  they will open up based on the amount you put. Then once you pump finish and got balance  go back counter take back thr balance. If credit runs out before you pump finish  then go back deposit money again lol..,btohqsg
I tot you go almost everytime de??,btohqsg
U should bring us  u regular,btohqsg
Unless the pump attendant authorized for you,btohqsg
Depends on place bro. My mother hometown no use practices,btohqsg
Mine is wait ari want go. Then I go. But now I no money I don't want go out.,btohqsg
This is really a troublesome process,btohqsg
Hence i just use credit card,btohqsg
Not really tho  once you get used to it it's actually easy alr,btohqsg
Same  I also use cc. But mine no need pre authorisation,btohqsg
But hor  sometimes biker pump finish liao ride to payment counter  then u go the pump is cannot use one. Cos previous txn not cleared... must wait,btohqsg
I cash poor  so nvr use cash beforeü•≤,btohqsg
Pre auth is no big dealüòÖ,btohqsg
Since I learned to pump at petronas  I nvr use cash anymore,btohqsg
Ya  but for 1st timer will shock a bit la,btohqsg
U think I open bank har,btohqsg
Lol.. imagine go further up north and you pump a few times,btohqsg
I kenna 3 x 200rm pre auth in 1 dayüòÇ,btohqsg
Suddenly 200rm was charged. I tot scam or something,btohqsg
Later tio suspend the card  suspected unauthorised transactionsüòÇ,btohqsg
Wanted to drive back to the kiosk to check but it's 5km from my hotel,btohqsg
Lol just ask here can liao,btohqsg
Should pump near my hotel next time,btohqsg
Anyway most weekends i am inside,btohqsg
If you really need help let me know  i see if i can,btohqsg
I'm the opposite  most weekdays I'm inside,btohqsg
I don't know man. I only hear many sg folks saying petrol so cheap there,btohqsg

üÜòÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏èThis kind of thing happens to me too‚ö†Ô∏èüÜò5/6/2023 Singapore üá∏üá¨ Take customers to GentingAt about 5.40am in the morning  this car followed me at about 27km from kulai. I was fast and it was fast and I was slow. At the rest stop  I continued to walk  and at about 37km  it was next to me again with blue lights flashing. I thought it was the police  and wanted to stop beside me. At the moment  I thought that this car was following me and then went to rest Standing next to me now. I used two spring belts to think together. At that time  I told customers to sit down and we might encounter fake police. At that time  I had to play a game with it and not let it stop in front of me.During the race with it  I called 999  and the police uncle asked me where I was  and told me not to stop  and if it still followed  go to the nearest police station.At about 71km  I didn‚Äôt look at it and followed it. Now at 8.10am  I stop at a crowded place to let customers have breakfast.üÜòIf a policeman who is not a police car asks you to stop  you have to look at the situation at the time. Don‚Äôt stop indiscriminately. It‚Äôs best to go directly to the nearby police stationüÜò,btohqsg
