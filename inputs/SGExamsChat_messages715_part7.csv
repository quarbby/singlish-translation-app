Yeah I also donâ€™t wear unless I sick. But Iâ€™m damn pissed thereâ€™s many ppl who still cough like mad on public transport without masks,btohqsg
They might have to inject multiple times,btohqsg

Yep they indeed did  I have two holes,btohqsg
Dude low-key I find packing fun,btohqsg
wow... looks like you were also an ex medic...,btohqsg
you truly have experience in many things sir,btohqsg
Y'all see the two needle scars,btohqsg
i feel like doctors cannot do needle work as well as nurses because when i went to the doctor for blood test she took v long and it hurt while the nurse did it was quite fast and relatively painless,btohqsg
Nono you're right man they just can't,btohqsg
Oh yea I think I have no told you about the goondu  you know the station when they check for urine,btohqsg
I remembered coz i was working in a hospital back then  then mask compulsory  i couldnt even survive 4h  i got giddy so i went to the toilet to take off my mask to brief,btohqsg
So pee in cup  put litmus paper ...let the person see the paper right,btohqsg
ok i should tell yall my medical story,btohqsg
I went to the toilet to breathe,btohqsg
Bruh got someone took the litmus paper and put on the desk ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Needle puncture thru vein hence blue black from skin,btohqsg
But it is no choice  else what  i faint at work,btohqsg
I donâ€™t but I still watch a lot of basic bio related stuff,btohqsg
They temporary increase your sugar levels,btohqsg
My job need move around a lot + the staff there like to slack n push more work to me,btohqsg
Ok looks like my interview will be wed at earliest coz the person has not contacted me,btohqsg
My intern is opposite  my supervisor everything also don't want do,btohqsg
Then in the end for the first week of intern I went there to wayang,btohqsg
But underlying issue is lack of blood circulation,btohqsg
At least you are awake  better than nothing,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t take bio even tho I thought itâ€™s interesting,btohqsg
I just needed a breather and drink lots and lots of water,btohqsg
Like I just thought Iâ€™d do better in physics,btohqsg
Yes the person keep hitting that part of my hand for like 10mins strsight,btohqsg
Wait but in sec sch did you take triple sci,btohqsg
I dropped bio in upper sec alr,btohqsg
Same until my plane flew at 1 miles per hr,btohqsg
Should i sacrifice revisions for interview preparations,btohqsg
Next wednesday and the following friday,btohqsg
They smacked the vein before even poking,btohqsg
After poke alr  they poked again,btohqsg
i think you'll feel better having done some prep asap,btohqsg
i took bio cause of sheer interest,btohqsg
otherwise your brain is gonna be fixated on it anyway,btohqsg
Oh yea im damn distracted tbh,btohqsg
Did you learn which tube carries the food to a plant,btohqsg
might as well channel that into actually prepping,btohqsg
instead of doing nothing about it,btohqsg
This is the life of a y4 std,btohqsg
