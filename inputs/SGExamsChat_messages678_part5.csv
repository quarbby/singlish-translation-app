i think today is my 13th reason,btohqsg
89.99rpers whenever they never get 90rp,btohqsg
redox is love redox is life,btohqsg
how to get rid of - 4x - 3,btohqsg
its not conducive to say this when ppl are trying to help younotonly does it limit your own progress  it also waste other people's time since you arent making effort to understand,btohqsg
just focus on removing the -4x@lxrthdon't forget about removing everything,btohqsg
â€¢ Derivative of f(x) as the gradient of the tangent to the graph of y = f(x) at apointâ€¢ Derivative as rate of changeâ€¢ Use of standard notationsâ€¢ Derivatives of xn  for any rational n  sin x  cos x  tan x  ex  and ln x  togetherwith constant multiples  sums and differencesâ€¢ Derivatives of products and quotients of functionsâ€¢ Derivatives of composite functionsâ€¢ Increasing and decreasing functionsâ€¢ Stationary points (maximum and minimum turning points and stationarypoints of inflexion)â€¢ Use of second derivative test to discriminate between maxima and minimaâ€¢ Applying differentiation to gradients  tangents and normals  connectedrates of change and maxima and minima problemsâ€¢ Integration as the reverse of differentiationâ€¢ Integration of xn  for any rational n  sin x  cos x  sec2 x and ex  together withconstant multiples  sums and differencesâ€¢ Integration of (ax + b)n  for any rational n  sin(ax + b)  cos(ax + b)  and eax+bâ€¢ Definite integral as area under a curveâ€¢ Evaluation of definite integralsâ€¢ Finding the area of a region bounded by a curve and line(s) (excludingarea of region between two curves)â€¢ Finding areas of regions below the x-axisâ€¢ Application of differentiation and integration to problems involvingdisplacement  velocity and acceleration of a particle moving in a straight line ðŸ˜£,btohqsg
let's say you have reminder 5 when diving by 3x-5,btohqsg
my brain cells changed from negative to infinity,btohqsg
then still got - 3 what,btohqsg
Differentiation and Integration I do not like,btohqsg
now try teaching florals about differentiation and integration,btohqsg
differentiation also can be used to find rate of change,btohqsg
fuqqqq i always eat mac lol,btohqsg
no other decent food/can study place with ac,btohqsg
though i like studying in sch libs,btohqsg
usually go mac cus school ends at 3 and my class starts at 6:30,btohqsg
so inconventient to go anywhr far,btohqsg
i was thinking anderson sec ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
i want to go anderson jc lol  not im at anderson sec,btohqsg
if no class i wld go nex or smth,btohqsg
if i dont slak and say too tired lol,btohqsg
why was this recommended to me earlier as a BCM student,btohqsg
theres is a place with free food but u need book first. and is at bukit timah,btohqsg
Y3 me wanted to take bfmh ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Are you that conflicted to think straight or wot lol idw assume otherwise but u do know there's a difference between idw and idkAre u the overlap between ( idw U idk)Â  cause if thats the case then  that one is rlly u needa figure out shit yourself,btohqsg
if no contrasting subj then i wld take bcfm,btohqsg
if my school offered ki and it could still replace gp i would take ki,btohqsg
tho alot of times i dont cause fatigue af lpl,btohqsg
thers a few places in sg like this.,btohqsg
tho hopefully term 2 not as much,btohqsg
btw any1 got tips for SJPO  physics junior olympiad,btohqsg
got 3 months gonna grind fr,btohqsg
Also I'm sure you're very new so as a long-time  member of the chat   imma remind u,btohqsg
bc idr alr from when i did sjpo,btohqsg
angular momentum  rotational KE  moment of inertia those are uni or H3 ig,btohqsg
iâ€™m basing off the doc he sent ah,btohqsg
Speaking of h3   I browsed thru the h3 phy notes like nth much leh,btohqsg
H3 dont teach fluid dynamics i think,btohqsg
Also more chim description and usage of words,btohqsg
might ask my cher for updated 1 if he have ig,btohqsg
how in depth should i study?,btohqsg
everything is an extension of H2 so you donâ€™t just deal with point like particles in mechanics,btohqsg
you use keplers laws more in gravitation iirc,btohqsg
I just rmb blanking from that lecture from mechanics,btohqsg
ellipse  dA/dt  period relation to axes,btohqsg
but ya if you have a solid understanding conceptually of H2,btohqsg
Ngl mine is kinda weak ISH but I think it's doable if I grind here and there to sharpen and strengthen my undst,btohqsg
wait siyan u took h3 phys,btohqsg
emphasis on conceptually bc you need to be able to translate the physics to the math,btohqsg
