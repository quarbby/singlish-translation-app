More of what insurance company you have for your insurance currently?,btohqsg
If you are existing MINDEF/MHA group policy holder  the cheapest will be Singlife.,btohqsg
One better way could be sharing your cc with family member... The only policies that don't charge you extra for changing to monthly payments are ILPs and it's a no-no.,btohqsg
Depends. If got 1 insurance $6k per annum break into monthly u pay maybe $12 more per month. But ensure that u get the 400+ per month.,btohqsg
If really bobian lor.. cc sharing still priority before getting charged 3% more on premiums,btohqsg
For the CMC just have to apply via your link right ? Don’t have minimum deposit or maintain requirements right ?,btohqsg
Hi all  for OCBC 360   I understand got bonus interest came in on 7th every month but I don’t see mine yet.. is it not 7th ? I opened since 1st Feb,btohqsg
It all depends on your personal comfort level  financial situation and life situation. What is acceptable for one person’s emergency fund may be too risky for another’s. But as a baseline consideration  emergency fund should be extremely safe  liquid and accessible. You can take this baseline and adjust to your personal preferences.,btohqsg

It is just a promotion for one mth. Whether they will continue after that remains to be seen. IF they don't  u will hv to hold the card for quite some time without using it  so my take is utilise other 6mpd cards,btohqsg

Hi  does anyone have any experience on fraud transactions for Citibank? Saw 2 on my cash back+  reported through the app  not sure if I have to call the bank?,btohqsg
Report through the app  I think they will ask you to cancel your card. Then give you a new card. In addition  they will investigate and refund you. For mine  they refunded. For mine  it was a apple store transaction.,btohqsg
thanks for the response! managed to cancel my card alr  would I need to do anything else to trigger the investigation or would they conduct the investigation upon reporting it through the app?,btohqsg
Have you pressed in the app  to highlight that this transaction is not yours? If not  will suggest you to go trigger it. There is like a form to fill in the details one.,btohqsg
