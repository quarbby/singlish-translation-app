High interest rates meaning high inflation as well. So nothing good about it. It just hedge against some inflation only.,btohqsg
I think in the t and c  if you keep ADB $200k for 6 months  you get $600 cash,btohqsg
Can share which section of the t&c states this?,btohqsg
Under 5 (d) - $300 one time cash reward for premier customers  $150 one time for personal banking for ADB $100k for first 6 consecutive months,btohqsg
provided new to HSBC and it is $300 or $150  not $600. Not really worth it since getting only 0.05% on 5th and 6th month,btohqsg
Anyone know how to pay the mthly town council sncc via citi payall ?,btohqsg
does payment via cardup count as qualifying transactions for credit cards giving sign up bonus with min spending requirements ?,btohqsg
It depends on the credit card t&c. No common standard for all credit cards.,btohqsg
I did a search and saw that it does for a few banks  for my case specifically for citi its supposed to count as qualifying spend but I called citi and they told me that it wasn't..,btohqsg
"in what way it ""supposed to count""?",btohqsg
If u save more than u consume  high interest rates is good.,btohqsg
Does anybody know golden moment is under what MCC code ?,btohqsg
Does Apple Pay support DBS Yuu AMEX card?,btohqsg
All bank-issued AMEX cards are not supported.,btohqsg
Only direct amex issue will support,btohqsg
If you add money into revolut via credit card  will it be considered as credit card spend?,btohqsg
Usually mcc 6540 topups are excluded.,btohqsg
Do let us know if it really works. will be a hack of a hack,btohqsg
Hi guru   For conservancy charges n insurance payment  what card do you all use ? Is it eligible for the 500 spending for the uob one account interest if i use the uob one or yolo card ?,btohqsg
I was just reading up on this haha. Recurring Insurance payments on UOB one card does qualify for the eligible spend for the interest to UOB one account  but it does not earn cashback,btohqsg
Hi guys does contactless payment at Sinopec earn 4mpd using HSBC revo?,btohqsg
Unfortunately it only earns 0.4mpd. Better cards would be UOB lady's  or UOB PPV,btohqsg
Sinopec 23% (fri  weekend) + OCBC got 5% rebate better right?,btohqsg
Yap technically 28% total. I think now ocbc Is 6% rebate,btohqsg
Tomorrow shell last day vpower for the price of shell 98.,btohqsg
should look at the actual TnC lah,btohqsg
Sinopec can also work with- Maybank FnF for 8%- Evol contactless for 8% (6.67% Ecb)- Citi cash back for 8%,btohqsg
So effective about 29.16 if with 8% cb ya,btohqsg
Can we use Maybank FnF with Amaze?,btohqsg
If May 100k + 5 transactions  (5.3)Jun +22k + 5 tran (100k 4.3 22k 5.3)Jul put +2k + 5 tran but take out -10k will the bal of 110k still get 4.3 interest?,btohqsg
Yes if you want to change to online shopping spend,btohqsg
for overseas use is also eligible right? for the dining and other categories in Maybank FnF,btohqsg
I applied in Oct. Clocked the spending in Nov. Received the payout via PayNow on following Mar.,btohqsg
Morning all  Do you guys cancel your unused credit cards? Or ask for waivers every year although you never use it?,btohqsg
2 choices:1. cancel your unused credit cards such that you can qualify for New to Bank status every X period (depends on each bank's policy).2. keep your unused credit cards because there could suddenly be an amazing promo which could revive usage of the card. If you had cancelled the card  it might no longer be offered or waiting for approval of the card could cause you to miss the promo.,btohqsg
Iâ€™d like to ask the GovernmentWhat are the conditions to use the reserves? Are there any metrics for the President to agree for the Reserves to be open? Such as projected unemployment rate if the reserves are not open  projected economic growth/decline etc?,btohqsg
Hi all  HSBC has DCC fee for Taobao? =(,btohqsg

Morning everyome  can ask : is it wise to tag my uob Krisflyer card to my amaze card as I also have a Krisflyer saving Acc ?Just thinking does it earn more miles ? Or is there a better way ?,btohqsg
Depends what time  late afternoon will reflect in dbs on the next working day,btohqsg
yes  can tag the card to Amaze  convert everything to online  earn 3mpd for online spend on some of the MCCs. Useful when u maxed out your 4mpd cards. Can still clock bonus miles when paired with the kf savings account.,btohqsg
Personally gonna stick with Citi PM  it's a general spend card so it's really rarely used. Points expire with the T1 Card  but not CitiPM or DBS altitude,btohqsg
I personally use Toshl (it's paid) for tracking across multiple banks. But in general excel should be sufficient,btohqsg
Should tally as payment is via Google Pay,btohqsg
Can we pay town council monthly fee via SAM using uob amex and still earn 1.7 cash rebate?,btohqsg
Yep. I rarely use gen spend cards typically as well. Have to find a card with points that don't expire.,btohqsg

UOB cancel card fromApp immediate sia lol. Efficient,btohqsg
