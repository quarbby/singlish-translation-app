WTI Crude Oily🛢️ futures rose to trade at $80 per barrel on Friday  as US diesel prices soared after the number of oil rigs dropped and a fire broke out at a refinery in Louisiana. Meanwhile  the greenback strengthened to an 11-week high after Powell's speech at Jackson Hole summit  who emphasized the US Federal Reserve's commitment to bringing inflation back to 2%.
