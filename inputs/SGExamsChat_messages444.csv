This is what I got lah,btohqsg
does campus matter actually  bc im known for a hospital campus,btohqsg
Ngl RP more important than portfolio,btohqsg
I hear btr rp in tmjc,btohqsg
ASRJC: Mean 75.4  35.9% 80-90TMJC: Mean 73.9  4 students 90 RP  ~33% 80-90,btohqsg
Cause TMJC the COP is also higher,btohqsg
- teachers- competitive/ toxic environment?- portfolio opportunities,btohqsg
Also  my score can get scholarship if I go TMJC or asrjc?,btohqsg
Why u dw go sajc ah,btohqsg
I feel likeThe higher the score the better the teacher,btohqsg
Nah this isn’t the main concern,btohqsg
First and Second factor most impt,btohqsg
Which sch have v good cher,btohqsg
I v leaning towards TMJC leh,btohqsg
And i like this type of not so mugger environment,btohqsg
But asrjc is know for mugging bro,btohqsg
That time we go sec 5,btohqsg
Emb3 25 and below can alr right,btohqsg
One student international she wan go sec 5,btohqsg

Corporate bonds can be split into retail tranche of non-retail tranche.It can be issued by private  public or government linked companies,btohqsg
eh probs time to do more research on such when im a lil older,btohqsg
To analyse more  that's why better to study maths,btohqsg
this kinda thing gotta be >18 rite,btohqsg
maths lowkey fun when uk wut u doing,btohqsg
but you must have the time and energy to study it,btohqsg
To even make sense (in terms of time commitment and energy) to start  best to have at least 50k in assets.But you can start if you have at least few k that you likely don't need for a few years.,btohqsg
i at a cafe theres some,btohqsg

rly first save for like emergency funds first,btohqsg
how many months worth is good,btohqsg
I was advising my students  don't bother about those financial advisers talk,btohqsg
when you just graduated  or still a student  your parents cover your emergency funds,btohqsg
you go and earn fast to build your treasure pot,btohqsg
safe bet if im on my own ah,btohqsg
because honestly  your expenditure when younger is so much lower. There's not much need to have an emergency fund that you cannot touch for investments,btohqsg
doesn't mean you spend and spend till zero of course,btohqsg
When I just graduated  I estimated a monthly expenditure of $700 to $900.How much emergency funds do I really need? 6 months of $800 = $4800,btohqsg
Take the time  read up on financial management and the markets.,btohqsg
That's why I think in JC  Econs is the most useful. Then take a basic accounting module in university.,btohqsg
All these give you a foundation and you can self learn from there.,btohqsg
Save up the first pot of gold (100k) asap. You will be more appreciative of your scenario later in life. You can also let your parents apply ssb/tbill for you.,btohqsg

If you feel like you are as tired as a dog all day long. You really misunderstood  the dog is not as tired as you. Life is like being on a treadmill. You are tired and vomiting blood  but in the eyes of others  you are still standing still.,btohqsg

If u make friends w ur bunk mate,btohqsg

I tot standard timing is 45 mins,btohqsg
To dig out the full one,btohqsg

Maybe one of my csemates will do that in bmt. Who knows,btohqsg
