#TOYOTAAIMS TO MAKE AT LEAST 2.5 MILLION VEHICLES A YEAR IN#CHINABY 2030  AN OVERHAUL THAT WILL SEE IT BRING ITS CHINESE SALES AND PRODUCTION OPERATIONS CLOSER TOGETHER AND ALLOW LOCAL EXECUTIVES A FREER HAND IN DEVELOPMENT.-REUTERS...,btohqsg
Can bet 5 to 1 they can't make it,btohqsg
By 2030  the EV penetration will be 70-80% for new vehicle sales. Unless Toyota can chase the Chinese technologies next 3 years,btohqsg
Toyota doesn't really offer any brand premium over the decent Chinese brands. And they're lagging in tech. I see no reason why Chinese would switch. Only their Lexus brand will stand above but it's premium priced so not the mass seller either for those numbers,btohqsg
Back in 2021 I told the guys in one of the groups to sell NIO stock etc. Way too overpriced. Someone told me they would go even higher. It was $50+ then now it's $5. I also said$LIwould do the best of the 3 due to hybrid. Also came true. 🤷‍♂,btohqsg
