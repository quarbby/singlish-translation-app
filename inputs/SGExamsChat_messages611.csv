Yes this is true unless u are not chinese,btohqsg
Yea not rlly a deal breaker,btohqsg
depends on what you define as btr,btohqsg
i asked my hci friend on her thoughts,btohqsg
‚Äúfor me i wouldn‚Äôt recommend going hci‚Äù,btohqsg
I just had to listen to my cher,btohqsg
But please not so friendly until you see ppl humping in class,btohqsg
But tbf that's just my class,btohqsg
i didn‚Äôt study for A levels and got into ntu,btohqsg
Tell me Ur sch is fked up without telling me Ur sch is,btohqsg
oh. cause my friend who went to ri  he and two other classmates were on a train  and they were just talking shit about jae students in front of him cos they dk my friend got in thru jae lol,btohqsg
We dh online lectures unless it's HBL once every two weeks,btohqsg
i mean there‚Äôs gonna be fucked up people in IP schools,btohqsg
same breed as those that label poly kids as failures,btohqsg
There's gonna be fucked up people everywhere man,btohqsg
there‚Äôs fucked up people in every school,btohqsg
I heard prcss damn strict one,btohqsg
some have more some have less,btohqsg
as a TA i‚Äôve seen an undergrad openly talk shit about people that come from poly,btohqsg
Our actual reporting time is 7 25,btohqsg
Alot of ur kouhais do that btw,btohqsg
At the bus stop at tp?,btohqsg
watch the Americans fail to answer simple geography questions,btohqsg
i mean that undergrad idt he has room to talk shit,btohqsg
bc i read his lab report,btohqsg
I don't think poly students talk down on ITE graduates lmao,btohqsg
i‚Äôm sorry if you can‚Äôt do the experiment properly,btohqsg
at least do a decent job faking data,btohqsg
Icic so not at the bus stop in the morning...,btohqsg
Bro is tryna reverse stalk me,btohqsg
so basically it's Vivian calling someone else illiterate again,btohqsg
the lab mod for physics majors,btohqsg
Actually I was hiding in the walls,btohqsg
idk how they mark the foundational lab mod for engineers sia tsk,btohqsg
not very happy with that but tsk it‚Äôs ok only 1 au,btohqsg
the physics ones are 2 AU,btohqsg
and we have one each sem,btohqsg
I'm a sec sch student now,btohqsg
I spent more time playing than studying,btohqsg
i have another one for s2 but that one pass/fail so it‚Äôs ok haha,btohqsg
But EJ is a sch only for extroverts,btohqsg
If ur not extroverted u will die,btohqsg
ok but i think the physics ones scaffold report writing skills quite well,btohqsg
tsk. fe1073 dk how they mark. so i did exactly what i did for a level phy prac when answering similar qns. Then become B+ üôÉ,btohqsg
It'll get btr when PW disappears,btohqsg
oh yeah mi they do pw  h1 and mt in y2 right,btohqsg
so y3 will be emptier altho some subjects probably add a bit more lesson time,btohqsg
(sees a japan flag) is that UK?,btohqsg
Thankfully i didnt go scgs or sngs,btohqsg
I mean I have alot of intro frens so uh,btohqsg
I had so much more fun when I ditched all the chs people to talk to the jae people,btohqsg
i go to jc to take alvls not to have fun,btohqsg
Best way to survive jc is min effort for 90rp,btohqsg
i dont recall learning a lot about gp answering techniques from her lmao,btohqsg
Yea I see pu3 timetable so empty,btohqsg
but maybe she improved over the years?,btohqsg
its been 5 years since i graduated after all,btohqsg
she came back cause need manpower,btohqsg
is this where u say sike,btohqsg
She staying back to help pu1,btohqsg
I wasn't taught by pillai but from what I heard about him  he can't teach for shit,btohqsg
Like everytime I walk past his class,btohqsg
Oh my fucking god my Cher say his style is diff but overall good Cher leh,btohqsg
But itz OK econs is self grindable,btohqsg
Oh maybe I'm fake news but that was my observations ah,btohqsg
But thx tho I'll take note of ur words big bro,btohqsg
Is it the same as before,btohqsg
sorry  everyone  I am staying behind in PU1. Hence  you will be taught by another teacher for this year. His style is different from mine but he is a good teacher. You guys keep up the good study habits and you will be great.:),btohqsg
Yea she say she left sch to exp other pathways and she said she taught pri sch sec sch and preferred to teach tertiary edu cause pupil r more mature,btohqsg
The only HDL I can treat is HDL DIY hotpot,btohqsg
Uh gimme a range like from $x-y?,btohqsg
Ngl if u send me anything,btohqsg
I can probably try and help,btohqsg
Or I will probably try and help,btohqsg
But my return time has like dramatically decreased,btohqsg
Cuz I have too many students sending me stuff,btohqsg
First thing first   like any good pupil I gotta figure whr I fk up,btohqsg
U can send me ur pu1 work,btohqsg
I can try and figure out,btohqsg
It cannot be worse than what I'm reading rn rite?,btohqsg
I wasn't in my best performance,btohqsg
"U don't write stuff like ""women belong in the kitchen""",btohqsg
Uh what else is thr that I read recently,btohqsg
"""Religion is not relevant because there are people who do not have religions""",btohqsg
Is that really written by a human,btohqsg
if u think ur work is bad,btohqsg
IP kids won't say there's a JAE-IP divide,btohqsg
Which is why I also won't comment abt it in ej,btohqsg
Cuz not my place to say,btohqsg
I want to believe there isn't (because I'm very close to the Jae people) but idk la at the end of the day,btohqsg
my mentees friends got mix of both,btohqsg
last time when dhs was pure ip and no jae we had one class for o level track,btohqsg
I think in general rite the divide manifests in terms of opportunities rather than friendgrps,btohqsg
basically those cmi in y2 ones,btohqsg
Like who is in council/house comm etc,btohqsg
most people are chill but there‚Äôs def some that‚Äôll feel they failures lol,btohqsg
In EJ I used to be a big problem,btohqsg
But I think they recently implemented a quota,btohqsg
jae gets offered the same chances but it‚Äôs q obvious coming from IP side has loads of benefits just by knowing people,btohqsg
I mean at least the student is trying to improve him/her self,btohqsg
I can't say A for effort tho,btohqsg
it feels like an insult to let you even read that,btohqsg
I forgot it's called skeletal structure right?,btohqsg
I managed to carry case study 2 into getting a consistent B though,btohqsg
But im almost certain he will flunk a levels,btohqsg
no matter what u think is bad,btohqsg
i would have always seen worse,btohqsg
Idk man gp is such an argumentative/discursive thing and when I was retook Os 2 times  I went fk it and focused only on PR and got b3,btohqsg
there is no discursive in GP,btohqsg
C6  C5(on and off free tutor lessons from kind stranger)   B3(with actual cher help),btohqsg
Damn  my sister is the introverted kind,btohqsg
remember guys don‚Äôt Andrew tate your essay,btohqsg
even if you‚Äôre the biggest tate fan,btohqsg
fuck i thought u meant tate as in tate mcrae and i immediately came in here to say that im her fan,btohqsg
In what format do I send,btohqsg
it depends how u use again,btohqsg
what if you edit it to your own language,btohqsg
I mean as long as it doesn't change the original meaning of what AI typed and it's relevant,btohqsg
"You're still writing it in your ""own words""",btohqsg
It's not sufficient if udh Ur own pts to begin with,btohqsg
I mean straits times have ChatGPT articles lol,btohqsg
Is like saying us have school shooting why sg dh,btohqsg
Tbh Idm ah   as long as got reply can alr  I'm taking GP with my H2s in y3 anw,btohqsg
This year is H1 and MT,btohqsg
ChatGPT specialises in presenting information (Similar as to what the purpose of the media is)Your GP essay is more akin to an opinion article. It needs to come with a strong sense of personal voice which already  chatGPT cannot achieve. Let alone other things like argumentative skills.,btohqsg
Which is why I would say you CAN use chatgpt to gather information for GP. But you shouldnt ask ChatGPT to write your whole essay,btohqsg
? Wym I am doing clb in j1,btohqsg
I mean what can u do lmao,btohqsg
My clb Cher said I can take h1 chi but why would I wan a death wish,btohqsg
I enjoy chi I learn otop can alr,btohqsg
H1  MT and PW in y2  ye,btohqsg
idk whats that in el i onli know how to read LOL,btohqsg

Hello hello baby you called i cant hear a thing,btohqsg
if u ever feel bad for not being good at chi just rmb I exist. I took basic Chinese and still can fail,btohqsg
I have got no service in the club you see see,btohqsg
Isn't na Chinese same as exp chinese,btohqsg
basic best mcq all the way,btohqsg
That time  my sch sec 3 NA or sec 2 NA started to take exp chi alr,btohqsg
sorry boss my chinese not good for exp,btohqsg
I see my friend's chi lit notes,btohqsg
And there's me who failed chi all da wae in sec 3 and was the worst performing student,btohqsg
I tahan till I manage to actually drop chi to clb in sec 4,btohqsg
Stop calling stop calling idw talk anymore,btohqsg
I mean for me I got no whr to drop unless I drop chi,btohqsg
I did try but still failed  and it was at that moment it's either I fk it or my trip sci cmi but heh I still ended at MI,btohqsg
it's not smth u hear everyday for sure,btohqsg
i didn‚Äôt even know clb existed until uni,btohqsg
honestly I think a lot ppl confuse bcl and clb,btohqsg
Bedok how heavy can u lift,btohqsg
i just didn‚Äôt realise there was an option besides not taking higher chinese,btohqsg
well u learn smtg new everyday,btohqsg
our sch got 1 CLB kid,btohqsg
i basically begged my sec 3 hcl teacher to let me pass even tho by right i failed,btohqsg
bc idw take chinese after sec 4,btohqsg
she basically said if she let me pass i have to promise to work hard for it,btohqsg
i got B3 so good enough,btohqsg
i mean she taught me for sec 4 too so like,btohqsg
Chinese lit is the only subj i got A* for for eoy,btohqsg
looking back she‚Äôs quite strict but can tell she really wants us to do well,btohqsg
She always play game with us,btohqsg
damn i almost wanna go back dhs to try find her now,btohqsg
yea but dk if she‚Äôll be around also,btohqsg
kek i can ask her for u,btohqsg
Record a vid of her saying smth to si yan,btohqsg
If y'all damn close that is,btohqsg
might have to change to clb rip,btohqsg
idk if she even rmb me,btohqsg
uk nobody asked but if I have any advice for any clb students  I would say don't be put down/influenced by other clb students who genuinely dl/hate chi  cause idk abt u but for me  i find that when I dislike/hate a subj  its always because i do badly in it and I keep lamenting/dreading abt it. Now when that happens  I find that such thoughts really cloud my judgement and I ended up not being appreciative of such a wonderful language which is in fact my mother tongue. I ended up not knowing what I could've learn/know more  I hope my sharing gives you/whoever more insight,btohqsg
No she look 30 year old,btohqsg
i‚Äôm gonna look older than her,btohqsg
whenever i face a minor issue  rso,btohqsg

Idk ah I quote my Cher,btohqsg

Funnily enough you do see that happening,btohqsg
Huh can retain in j1 and j2 meh,btohqsg
So 4 years in jc max ah?,btohqsg
Not very common but I do know of some individuals,btohqsg
Her entire home class didn't do well,btohqsg
I tot max is 2 yrs in jc,btohqsg
And yep this is more than likely to be true,btohqsg
Nah I thought is 3 years,btohqsg
I have one student 4 yrs,btohqsg
At that point they should‚Äôve gone to poly lmao,btohqsg
So the normal route is j1 den j2 a lvl fk up den retain?,btohqsg
my student J1 he retained twice before coming,btohqsg
At that rate the student should just go poly sia,btohqsg
My friend got S S U U U for mye,btohqsg
Gave up jc and went to msia,btohqsg
I have friends here  a year younger than me and they retained,btohqsg
They're basically going thru sec 4 again,btohqsg
Then he went to some msia uni to study med  but the demands were high,btohqsg
Haha it's funny if u think abt it,btohqsg
The real early is after o lvls go private,btohqsg
He studying at some international sch rn,btohqsg
When did you do bmt xD,btohqsg
I had classmate went kaplan after o lvls  went ns and uni in Australia  now gonna grad soon,btohqsg
idk the 6 years guy  i just heard from the MI guys in my intake,btohqsg
When most of my classmates just start uni,btohqsg
Sekali I know the person sia that would be hilarious,btohqsg
I'm so tempted to bring home cooked food to sch,btohqsg
But here's the catch it's either I gotta wake up earlier than 5am to cook or wake up at 5am to cook but risk injuring myself,btohqsg
imagine waking up early half asleep and cooking,btohqsg
i meal prep on sunday then just bring to office,btohqsg
then wed/thurs night another round of meal prep,btohqsg
first a level 50+  2nd one was 70+,btohqsg
Mine is just oats water then boil then simmer and add condensed/evaporated? Milk,btohqsg
then do night before ah so morning just take and go,btohqsg
Eh but idk if will spoil snot,btohqsg
Idw eat sch food alr fking travel so far and sch fd  is like $3/4/5,btohqsg
But it makes my oats mushy and hard,btohqsg
U can try oaks with milk den whack the fruits inside,btohqsg
Morning either microwave or just let it out of fridge,btohqsg
the catch of the catch is that it is hard to keep that up lol,btohqsg
my first week in unit  i used to wake up early then bike 15km from my house to camp  after 1 week i rather get more sleep,btohqsg
Am I sane to add sunny side up to my delicious oats,btohqsg
if you like it go for it,btohqsg
I only have air fryer now,btohqsg
Haven't looked it up yet but Idh seasoning,btohqsg
Just pour milk or hotwater and eat,btohqsg
wait who was that fella  the navy seal then doctor then astronaut,btohqsg
Got a title named frogman smth,btohqsg
interviewer ''why do you want to do med?''me ''i want go back camp and give recoots MCs'',btohqsg
Yes i googled for his name,btohqsg
But pretty sure anyone went through hell week got some loose screws in their brain lol,btohqsg
And one of the platoon‚Äôs pc,btohqsg
i survived overly ambitious asian parents trainings,btohqsg
I stuck in european time that ‚Äòs why,btohqsg
Why go club when u can have your own,btohqsg
Yes u took Os before mah,btohqsg
My Os chem foundation is shet,btohqsg
Was jus wondering if u had any tip or two,btohqsg
I tot u in mi rdy,btohqsg
Still need o lvl stuff ah,btohqsg
I mean cause uk some of the concepts are built upon Os topics,btohqsg
Yea Its diff but if my Os foundation cmi or barely make it  idk how to like ace As? Does that make sense,btohqsg
Bedok do uk a mou kai,btohqsg
Org chem is just some mol cal üò≠,btohqsg
Oh just curious to see how he's doin  kaypoh abit cause he was my pri sch classmate,btohqsg
I think there's also this v short guy whose name is Jia smth   I forgot,btohqsg
Was my work colleague who knew him too LOL,btohqsg
But that was 3 years ago,btohqsg
If that's the case we are from the same batch man,btohqsg
goddam every1 knows every1 else here lol,btohqsg
It's either u were the quiet kid/low profile kind cause I don't recognise u from the pfp HAHA,btohqsg
Uk like a few at least,btohqsg
6.3 and above not so much,btohqsg
That time I even heard they started learning sec sch stuff,btohqsg
they don't mention the retainers fr,btohqsg
"""Ultimately if u wan go uni   btr to go jc""",btohqsg
Those I've talked to in poly told me that,btohqsg
I mean they also have JC friends ah,btohqsg
They didn't advise with that kind of mindset,btohqsg
Also those who said that didn't have a course they're really passionate abt + no directn lol,btohqsg
"""Unless u have a v particularly course ur int in  JC's the *more preferred/btr option*  """,btohqsg
Oh so be it bottom or top,btohqsg
Then what makes the diff is the portfolio,btohqsg
Do I have less of an advantage since I clb,btohqsg
It's not counted as an official h1,btohqsg
they might adjust the difficulty along with it,btohqsg
Cause like let's say  me and another person  got same score same grade everything  portfolio also,btohqsg
Idk man like got risk factor,btohqsg
pray i somehow squeeze in during those years,btohqsg
cannot be that far wat  otherwise wld leak out easier,btohqsg
Just nice when the new As system takes place,btohqsg
I kinda feel bad for those who retain,btohqsg
i tot this yr alrdy pw pass/fail?,btohqsg
I wonder if the admission criteria is deadass strict asf,btohqsg
they did say that the 4th would only count if it improves the candidate's RP,btohqsg
so we still gon have 90rp,btohqsg
when did the holy grail change to anime waifu lmao,btohqsg
For the new system in later years,btohqsg
I never understood what is the aim of the 70RP system,btohqsg
if you read the news  they did say 4th sub is only counted if it improves your RP,btohqsg
Doesn't it just make everything more stressful,btohqsg
So you can get 70 still,btohqsg
so if you can go from 70/70 to 90/90  sure but if like 70/70 to 79/90 then nah,btohqsg
So short term less stress long term more stress,btohqsg
Iirc students complain PW take too much of time or smth,btohqsg
i guess it will be more similar to the uk a level scoring system,btohqsg
I spent my whole J1 doing PW,btohqsg
And threw my content subjects down the drain,btohqsg
They want students to focus on academics or smth,btohqsg
PW isn't even inherently stressful tbf,btohqsg
Like so called take off that load,btohqsg
The stress comes from working with people,btohqsg
Ya so it's a people issue,btohqsg
For PW  every part counts right,btohqsg
My invigilator forgot to cut me at 5 minutes,btohqsg
I ended up speaking for 7 minutes,btohqsg
Is there like a saving grace if u were to fk up one of the PW components,btohqsg
Wait idg why PW was such a big stressor,btohqsg
I think mine does that too,btohqsg
It's only stressful IF U WANT 90RP,btohqsg
But u don't need 90RP to go to every course,btohqsg
Then ur time management just sucks,btohqsg
Which has a high standard for PW,btohqsg
In the sense that the projects are actuslly implementable,btohqsg
Every other sch u can anyhow write smth it doesn't matter,btohqsg
Is the extra 2 min counted,btohqsg
U literally cannot get less than a B for PW unless the system fucks u over,btohqsg
Yeah she basically gave up on a levels,btohqsg
Okay but anyways if u remove PW why not just make it a 80RP system,btohqsg
Instead of REMOVING THE OTHER CONTRASTING,btohqsg
Oh ya they also didn't wan students to be overly obsessed and focused on securing an A for PW too,btohqsg
Then make the 90RP less necessary or less indicative of someone's success as a person,btohqsg
Bruh bedok   violinist's fingers are strong asf  they definitely hit the finger gym every day  I thought pipa was hard enough üò≠,btohqsg
U just trying to solve the symptoms of the problem without solving the actual reason,btohqsg
They think they did by making it pass/fail,btohqsg
Maybe it's one of those in the long term kinda shit,btohqsg
I have multiple students JAE in and didn't kena anything as well,btohqsg
Honestly it really depend on the individual and the ppl you meet,btohqsg
As i have said in the discord there is this thing where your reality is influenced by ur perceptions - if you think ppl are gonna ostracise you and think ur an outcast  chances are you will subconsciously dont mix with them which leads to them not talking to you  then in this case its a no brainer they wont be friends with you,btohqsg
Also Ik this is very unfair and sounds harsh but then sometimes in life you have to go and take the first move. Ppl like familar things so during ori its expected that the IP kids will stick to their friends who they have known for years  but this is not that they dislike you. Even in the primary school I am doing my work attachment at  I see kids from the same kindergarten sticking together. People naturally gravitate towards familiar people. If you want to befriend someone  make the first move. You have nothing to lose even if they dont want to befriend you,btohqsg
And if you have a good personality  chances are there will be people who are willing to include you. You may not be as close as the others but this is really something we cannot control- it is just a matter of your own luck,btohqsg
"Good personality is subjective imo  and ppl can be kinda overly selective sometimes( I'm not one of them {real} ) and  uk to those who initiate first and step out of their comfort zone  at least you've tried associating/communicating with them and lest things don't t always go the way we want/desire to  at least you've let them know that social cue that you wanna friend them  and alsooo if things doesn't work out   it doesn't mean its time to cast self-doubt  esp if you really have a genuine ""good personality"" .. self reflection maybe   to work on self-improvement and social etiquettes",btohqsg
most of my friends now are people whom i made the first move to talk to üò≠,btohqsg
I managed to befriend some boys during sec 1 ori cause of clash royale,btohqsg
I saw this guy playing and I was like yo,btohqsg
Jc ori i didn't do anything,btohqsg
This guy called jasper js out of nowhere started talking to me,btohqsg
missed sec sch ori cus covid sadge,btohqsg
I think all this while tm dh,btohqsg
But after hearing abt it  I'm happy ngl,btohqsg
Every jc got some vape story,btohqsg
Im at giant and i went to see  qipao but all the designs i like only have kids sizing then the ones i can fit in all aunty pattern,btohqsg
I have 2 qipao dress and 1 set,btohqsg
Idk man sometimes I browse the kids clothing section and I rlly miss the times when I used to wear em,btohqsg
Im 17 you cant expect me to wear this T_T,btohqsg
Giant qipao cmi  I went there see ald,btohqsg
It's like those funeral dresses before u kenna cremated,btohqsg
fren from ite wishy washy on what to do after graduating lmao,btohqsg
oh ya reminds me his internship was 30$ per day lmao,btohqsg
but dont take it as the gospel lah,btohqsg
like its good for a generic idea of how well you need to do but for specifics best to check uni website,btohqsg
i mean poly intern if hit 1k is considered quite good,btohqsg
uni 1k is p average but depends on industry,btohqsg
but ironic i can just get a part time job with more pay,btohqsg
u need to consider some courses grade their intern,btohqsg
She told me one of the guys she fucked from hitching has HIV,btohqsg
good luck bro time for a stem cell transplant,btohqsg
I mean you only need the third one now,btohqsg
there‚Äôs a reason why some companies can still get away with paying interns super low despite that,btohqsg
She told me it's slut shsming if she gets tested though,btohqsg
She only fucked the guy like one week before we started dating,btohqsg
IM NOT EVEN KIDDING OR TROLLING,btohqsg
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW SERIOUS HIV DISEASE/AIDS IS,btohqsg
anyway soon os ppl getting results,btohqsg
she said only incels care about HIV,btohqsg
YOUR LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT SLUTSHAMING WHATEVER,btohqsg
she on a diff mental wavelength fr,btohqsg
alot of the igp went down,btohqsg
i hope it goes more down for me,btohqsg
Just cuz she say that does it means it right,btohqsg
HIV is no longer a death sentence but stupidity is !!!!,btohqsg
ur health is more important than whatever,btohqsg
i think the cher -1 cos of spite,btohqsg
hiv is not funny or what,btohqsg
even if ur positive there are antiviral meds to suppress it so you can live a relatively healthy life now,btohqsg
She said she'll break up with me if I test for hiv,btohqsg
but if you decide to be rtard and dont get tested when it goes to aids,btohqsg
because it means i don't trust her,btohqsg
wake up your BLOODY IDEA bro,btohqsg
than have the muscles slowly rot off my body,btohqsg
even if u dont hold hand,btohqsg
pls bro idw u to get aids even though idk u,btohqsg
can anyone provide a Contrasting opinion?,btohqsg
I feel like the safest thing is to just not date girls with a huge sexual past,btohqsg
Pretty sure there's only 1 side when YOUR FUCKING LIFE IS ON THE LINE,btohqsg
I mean maybe you like mah,btohqsg
im sorry but dudes gf slept with a hiv positive guy and then toldkartosnot to get tested,btohqsg
I only knew cuz she confessed after a mutual friend told me,btohqsg
3 of whivh wrre from hitch,btohqsg
I know but that‚Äôs really L,btohqsg
sorry im very emotional about this kind of things because my closest aunt passed away due to breast cancer because she refuse to get tested,btohqsg
so im very emotipnal about this kind of stuff,btohqsg
Feels bad bro sorry for your loss,btohqsg
even if ur positive at least uk early,btohqsg
Yea I get what you mean,btohqsg
Experiences rly shape how we feel abt stuff la,btohqsg
I'm scared of being called out for slut shaming,btohqsg

I get sued for being sexist,btohqsg
