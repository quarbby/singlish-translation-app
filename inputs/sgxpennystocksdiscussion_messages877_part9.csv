🚀Pika World Markets In Review 2023🚀🥁It's finally a wrap for the market as major indices lose steam on the final trading day. The S&P 500 had tried hard to close a record high but failed to do so in 2023.It had punched 4793  the highest level in the morning trading session  slightly shy from its record high of 4797. After this  the index started to fall by 0.3%. Still  it is up about 24% for the year  a commendable recovery.🎢The Nasdaq Composite had a good run  rising by about 43% of the year and falling 0.6% today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average displayed resilience as it fell a minor 0.1%  up 14% for the year.🎲2023 has been an eventful year. Despite many analysts' loud calls for recession  the US economy was robust  and the labour market showed enormous strength. The gross domestic product grew at a faster-than-expected rate of 2% annually in the first half of 2023 and sped up its expansion to 4.9% in the third quarter.🍏Corporate profits were sound  and earnings were generally melodious to investors. The S&P 500 is expected to report an earnings per share rise of around 3% in 2023  given a healthy trend of 8 out of 11 sectors showing growth. The dark clouds gathered around energy and materials companies which are hit by significant declines  mainly due to the high base effect of profits in 2022  which is often seen as unsustainable during a commodity bull run.💰The Fed had pumped interest rate to an excess of 5%  higher than Wall Street's estimate  and now futures are pricing in rate cuts for 2024. The initial hawkishness by the Fed had sent turbulence across Treasury yield  sending regional banks' stocks into turmoil.🔑Finally  the arrival of the Artificial Intelligence craze spurred technology stocks to new highs  and the major beneficiaries were Nvidia and Microsoft. As the rally continued in November  we saw a broadening out of gains beyond the magnificent 7 stocks.As we look back at this stock development  momentum is planned into the first half of 2024 as we look forward to optimising our positions that we have yet to pare down to a more comfortable level.Let's hope for a better January 2024 stock movement  and cheers to yet another splendid year.As always  your best trading buddy reporting Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
