Don‚Äôt mind ask if anyone know any bank credit card have once in a lifetime rule for new comer welcome offer? Is it only Amex or is there others too?,btohqsg
Ok la. Just one month impacted if participate in rising dragon first period.,btohqsg
Follow the tip at the bottom of this post will be good enoughhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/185624,btohqsg
This is only for new users right?,btohqsg
There is also a 6.8% promo for existing userrs  will post later,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone knows how I can upgrade to HSBC Premier for the EGA account? Tried submitting the form via their website but have not heard back from them,btohqsg
For this ocbc 360 promo  i assume that the save criteria will also be able to stack right? Just that no x2 the interest on first 75k. Just follows normal 360 rates?,btohqsg
no i dont think can stack,btohqsg
After the end period  closely monitor if the agreed 6.8% is credited to your account as coupon.1). If the coupon is not credited by Moomoo  remember to chase Moomoo.2). If the coupon is partially credited by Moomoo  remember to chase Moomoo to topup the difference.3). If it is fully credited  remember to click the coupon to redeem it.Failure to do so may result you getting 0% instead of 6.8%.Good luck to you.,btohqsg
Meaning if im new to ocbc 360 if i hit the ‚Äúsave‚Äù criteria i dont get additional interest?,btohqsg

based on the picture its only applicable to salary and spend   only when u do both of this u will be able to get the 5.2%,btohqsg
Wow.. Where do I find this 6.8% coupon? Same place when I redeem other new sign up reward?,btohqsg
Amounts after first 75k not eligible for additional interest rate.,btohqsg
Yes that i am aware. Just hoping to clarify this point‚Ä¶ so for existing ocbc 360 accountsSpend + Save + Salary = 4.65% EIR on 100kIf im new to OCBC 360 and i hitSpend + Save + Salary = 4.65% EIR on 100k (normal) + the additional 2.6% (promo) on 75k of the 100kIs that correct?,btohqsg
Based on t&c  yes. Similar if you don't hit either categories then you'll lose that specific category additional interest.,btohqsg
How about existing customer that is currently participating in the 6.8% till mid of Apr? R we still eligible for it?,btohqsg
I.e. take out the deposit after 30 or 60 days maturity. N redeposit next day after signing up? Will that work?,btohqsg
Thx for confirming! I expected it to b the case. Just wanted to confirm here. Thx vm,btohqsg
wah what criteria is this  rebate so high,btohqsg
new moomoo client eligible for 150k deposit?,btohqsg
Fulfilling both salary and spend plus 100k balance,btohqsg
Apr 2024 is the final month for this $100k 5%.,btohqsg
If I withdrew from the sgd cash fund ytd  can I still participate? Waiting for the money to be withdrawn-able in my account now,btohqsg
What if you use mobile payment to groceries for HSBC revolution? Considered eligible? Since it‚Äôs contactless.,btohqsg
Where n when ? There is Revo nerf announced recently. Groceries may or may not eligible.,btohqsg
Recently the news  groceries will not be eligible for miles from 1st May.,btohqsg
From May will only get base rewards as seen from t&c.,btohqsg
Hi all  can I seek ur advise.. I plan to buy stock .. which one better (syfe or moomoo) ?,btohqsg
Hi guys could i know where u store ur emergency funds approx 30k? Previous was using sc esaver but looking at alternative now. Would be good to have no salary requirements,btohqsg
No frills can still look at maribank or gxs bank.,btohqsg
Hopefully no spend as that time sc esaver was having like 3.88% no frills for feb-mar.,btohqsg
Ahh alrights thanks fr the rec!,btohqsg
Received singsaver reward of $50 voucher for hsbc advance card that I applied in dec 23. There is supposed to have another $200 cash reward but no news? Anyone knows will it be given soon?,btohqsg
Would it be better to keep uob one + ega  or better to jump ship to sc bonus saver after may?,btohqsg
Oh right.. the OCBC 360 ‚Äòsave‚Äô also quite hard to monitor‚Ä¶ if that 1 month screwed (<$500) that‚Äôs 1.50% lesser that month,btohqsg
"I suggest to wait for all the banks to finish ""nerfing"" and dust to settle before reviewing what is available then. Decision made in a haste are usually not the best ones.",btohqsg
and we do have time to ponder...UOB One 5% on $100k lasts until 30th april anyway,btohqsg
I have participate in this promo but do I need to click anything? Do I need to manual subscribe Fullerton SGD,btohqsg
US or SG stocks? US can look at thishttps://youtu.be/1cjm5hFeCS4?si=xHkTFFKIugbhJEZq,btohqsg
Need to manual subscribe after participating,btohqsg
Agreed! Just open BonusSaver and its nerf...,btohqsg
