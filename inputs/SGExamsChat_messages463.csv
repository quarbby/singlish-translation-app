maybe for those with sports cca? idk,btohqsg
Well. We js went thru this programme called Fitness for Life where u select one sport of ur choice but that isn’t NAPFA,btohqsg
nyone know if i apply1: course A2: course Bcan B and A offer u a spot  then u reject A to choose B,btohqsg
If im not wrong only one course can offer you a spot,btohqsg
what if u reject that spot?,btohqsg
Meaning eg if course B offers you a spot  means course A rejected you already,btohqsg
But why do u wanna choose Ur second choice over ur first,btohqsg
like maybe 1st and 2nd is medicine n cs,btohqsg
What i did is i applied course A in nus  course B in NTU  course C in SMU,btohqsg
My second choice was CS which i applied for in nus,btohqsg
My top choice was my current course in ntu,btohqsg
U wan course inside for cs I can tell u,btohqsg
I applied biz n info sys in smu also as a middle option,btohqsg
Thank GOD i didnt go cs,btohqsg
Like watchu wanna know abt cs,btohqsg
thats why im abit sus about going med also,btohqsg
cos noone reply me when i ask abt medicine,btohqsg
I wld say u are dreaming but u probably wont hv time to,btohqsg
are they all to busy to reply,btohqsg
scared uni no time then i pass away,btohqsg
I can ask my friend's brother who is nus med,btohqsg
but how am i gonna do exams without sleep,btohqsg
In uni u feel the line btwn life n work slowly blur and meld tgt,btohqsg
In jc i thought 12 is late,btohqsg
But to quote Taylor swifts hit song anti-hero,btohqsg
i always sleep at 12 max,btohqsg
12 is when the brain juice flows,btohqsg
yeaa the overactive mind works the hardest in the darkest of nights,btohqsg
Apart frm med n cs any other choice,btohqsg
Because its serene and nothing much to distract you too,btohqsg
...unless you are your own distraction,btohqsg
I can tell u how much sleep u wont get for other courses too :3,btohqsg
Have you went out at like 3-4 am,btohqsg
sch start 830/9 need wake up 7 barely get my 7 hours,btohqsg
Imma finish this by 12 moment,btohqsg
The great thing about uni is you can customise your time table,btohqsg
I have friends whose first lesson is literally 330pm,btohqsg
At 4 im like  its alr 4 might as well finish,btohqsg
Alot of uni stress is self induced,btohqsg
Everyone wants to one up everyone else,btohqsg
Cant have arm races if my arms are tied,btohqsg
arms race in jc at least can work towards a levels,btohqsg
uni is cumulative gpa or something right,btohqsg
All the ppl with connections appear,btohqsg
And all the ultra talented ppl with insane first yr internships,btohqsg

No your eyes did not deceive you...that is a bunkbed without a top bed,btohqsg
I had a Super sexual Chem teacher,btohqsg
Best part  it was a she,btohqsg
She bend over toward a male student  then quietly whispered “don’t tell your parents”...everybody heard that Whisper and laughed,btohqsg
Take that out of context and that's a mad scene,btohqsg
Then another time  she asked the class of 16 yr olds...how many times your parents had sex,btohqsg
A girl in my class confidently reply “how we know”,btohqsg
In a irritated voice might I add,btohqsg
tbh idk what im doing half the time in class,btohqsg
But yes that teacher was memorable af,btohqsg
Is girl still crying over h2 geog,btohqsg

Guys here is a dark humor i thought off,btohqsg
What country has the most cheese,btohqsg
Hiring managers in top spots dont fall for smokes and mirrors,btohqsg

Suck some seniors cock at the guys toilet and hope he provides u with smth,btohqsg

what the fuck my face id don’t recognise me without glasses,btohqsg
idk  if you have looked up the career pathway to become a jc teacher over a uni lecturer,btohqsg
bro  in my cca there are more FCH than non-FCH,btohqsg
they were taught to teach differently  cant really compare them like that,btohqsg
btw which one career path took longer,btohqsg
if u oni see people with specs seeing the without is a completely diff person,btohqsg
i mean even if you aim to do well  you can really enjoy uni a lot more,btohqsg
a jc teacher or a uni lecturer...which career path is longer,btohqsg
uni lecturer means undergrad -> phd (sometimes masters too) -> years of postdoc work -> pray you get uni offer,btohqsg
every uni position has like 100 people vying for it,btohqsg
how long on average does it take to become one,btohqsg
Normally they take those with industrial experience,btohqsg
min is bachelor's degree + few years experience,btohqsg
experience in the field you want to teach,btohqsg
One of my lecturers got 20 yrs of exp working in the bank & js joined,btohqsg
"i rmb my poly lecturer was flexing on the whole class...He told everyone ""I only have to work two days in the whole week  think about that for a second. How come i am only required to work two days a week""",btohqsg
Depends on ur poly. Mine doesn’t do that,btohqsg
"then to add insult to injury  he said...""when you all go for break  i also go for break""",btohqsg
i mean that's how it works yes,btohqsg
One of the poly lecturers I know got an influencer wife,btohqsg
my supervisor went bachelors -> NIE -> teach JC -> phd -> NTU lecturer,btohqsg
at least that poly lecturer teaches,btohqsg
He teach a very common business module,btohqsg
and not randomly decides to give random grades,btohqsg
"this showoff lecturer i had  gave half the class a ""F"" grade...but then you look at our remaks  it was like he copy and pasted it across everyone",btohqsg
Well. u all can do the same for him for the survey. Everything at the lowest,btohqsg
these surveys mostly don't do anything,btohqsg
in uni if we wanted smth done about a shit prof  we form a group and go higher up the chain,btohqsg
At least for them to vent ig,btohqsg
got leh but always doesn’t recognise me idk why,btohqsg
a week later  he told the class...he already changed the F's to a D,btohqsg
the reasoning of why it was marked F  because the answer key was wrong 💀,btohqsg
if you mark blindly and don't question then a bit stupid also la,btohqsg
you just see what you submitted,btohqsg
i mean in uni you don't get back your final scripts,btohqsg
you just get your grade for the sem at the end,btohqsg
everyone did...that was the only reason why they found out their marking scheme was wrong,btohqsg
also profs can curve it how they want like,btohqsg
20% of the cohort got an F for a mod and had to repeat the next year,btohqsg
my worst mod too with a C,btohqsg
btw guys  is getting a E a failure?,btohqsg
pls dont let it be a core mod,btohqsg
uhhh it is but the prof rotates,btohqsg
a core mod with 20% failure???,btohqsg
yea but only when this prof teaches,btohqsg
if is the other prof it's ok,btohqsg
nothing is scarier than my existence in this course :(,btohqsg
ya Sia my fucking brain tot swaj,btohqsg
wasnt this from a year ago,btohqsg
we living in a diff world,btohqsg
LOL imagine kids having to learn this crap,btohqsg
its q interesting how the professor analyse it,btohqsg
fuck la i slp then now my neck all pain,btohqsg
didnt they vote on this last year too,btohqsg
"thats not very ""overwhelming majority"" tbvh",btohqsg
The scope of the special military operation is advancing,btohqsg
