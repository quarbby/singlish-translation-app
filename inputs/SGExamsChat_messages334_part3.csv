blue and purple worked okay for me   but im not sure about pink,btohqsg
it really depends on how dark your natural hair is,btohqsg
i box dyed it dark brown a few months ago,btohqsg
but its quite brown under light,btohqsg
then the pink might show a little  but i doubt it would be obvious (like it may only be obvious under certain lighting),btohqsg
then what do u think abt blue and purple?,btohqsg
dark blue worked fine on my black hair so i think purple would work too unless its super dark purple,btohqsg
