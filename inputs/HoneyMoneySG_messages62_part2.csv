sorry to read this.. I saw a few replies abt getting will in place.. just fyi that the original will needs to be presented and ideally the executor be identified in itEven if u get a lawyer to draft it  there is no centralised record of the details of the will so Ur family must know where to find the original.If thumbprint is used  need to state left or right thumbJust also be aware that investment using Cpf will not fall under the cpf nomination. It will form part of Ur will instead..,btohqsg
