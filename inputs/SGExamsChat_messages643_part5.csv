iâ€™m just gonna try my luck,btohqsg
Idk though  but Iâ€™m guessing they didnâ€™t decrease the ip intake in the 3 schs. They just crammed more JAE students in ej,btohqsg
5 Ip Classes 5 O lvl classes,btohqsg
just needa not succumb to my laziness,btohqsg
we came at the right time ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
if a jc accepts my appeal will my poly spot be withdrawn,btohqsg
or must i accept the appeal,btohqsg
Can I chk about private candidate application?,btohqsg
Can I apply for jus 1 subject as Pte candidate and combined the other subjects frm previous yr for JAE?,btohqsg
hi i js got into cbp in tp with 12 l1r5 after cca points  can i still appeal into diploma business?,btohqsg
up to 2 results  not limited to just 1 subject,btohqsg
hm since ur l1r5 is 12 then cop is 13 should be ok. but since it is poly wont it be l1r4 or elr2b2? so ur score should be way better than cop. so yea you can appeal,btohqsg
r ur guys schools bb cca more lax than ncc or npcc?,btohqsg
i swear ncc ppl are fully into it lol,btohqsg
i assume cus over the years o level grades mean is getting ever slightly better?,btohqsg
but at the end of the day top schools will still take the top X% even if 10 somehow becomes the norm maybe?,btohqsg
even if the mean is better  the top percentile will move along with it  wldnt necessarily mean its easier?,btohqsg
AI thing i cant rmb which jc 3-10,btohqsg
dropping means the score is lower,btohqsg
omg old channel 5 logo ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
they changed it but still got the original 5,btohqsg
so ure saying a level results are getting worse?,btohqsg
crazy to think abt it u r studying with probly the next minister,btohqsg
Mhm  not completely demolish and rebuilt,btohqsg
They said itâ€™s cos IJC campus not very old so can reuse  but it doesnâ€™t make sense that TMJC will likely get the 2nd batch of PRIME upgrading in the near future but MJC campus is like only 2 years older than IJC,btohqsg
70ish hard to go for competitive uni right?,btohqsg
If I rmbr correctly  TMJC will shift to TPJC campus once TJC moves back to their old site,btohqsg
Then existing MJC campus will be rebuilt,btohqsg
But not much details yet since havenâ€™t officially announce. So far itâ€™s just the 3 other merged JCs plus TJC,btohqsg
Maybe theyâ€™re doing most of the works later,btohqsg
want to go engineering so pretty tuff lol,btohqsg
For yijc they shouldâ€™ve just used IJC as the holding site and completely rebuild yjc campus  but itâ€™ll cost more money,btohqsg
havent looked that far ahead lol,btohqsg
Idk why moe willing to spend more on the other JCs then,btohqsg
At this point  moe might as well just spend more money on yijc but convert it to a 3 year a level course lol,btohqsg
Everyone. Moving to the eunoia style,btohqsg
shld have went combine sci lol,btohqsg
Even jpjc getting a completely rebuilt campus at the former jjc site,btohqsg
I think eventually will upgrade like asrjc,btohqsg
Like the first 90 rp in 2022,btohqsg
is Millenia institute worse than yijc,btohqsg
actually when was the last time a new jc was built,btohqsg
Damn. Basically all the merged schs became worse after the merger,btohqsg
Ajc used to be very good but now not rly,btohqsg
then how did eunoia get so low so fast?,btohqsg
I think pjc was quite good  now jpjc is worse than that,btohqsg
I should say  worse than the better of the 2 schs at least,btohqsg
But I know pjcâ€™s performance was improving in the lead up to the merger,btohqsg
dam eunoia first year already 9,btohqsg
wait then how did orientation start in eunoia lol?,btohqsg
