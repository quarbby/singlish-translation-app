Most of my closest friends are from ITE,btohqsg

EJC income inequality is damn fked cuz u have scgs students,btohqsg

im just speaking from personal experience,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry folks rmb  rp‚Äôs intake is falling‚Ä¶so they will literally accept anybody‚Ä¶if your gpa in the other 4 poly like dropout status come rp,btohqsg

y‚Äôall have to climb a rocky ass mountain to climb up,btohqsg
what is the comtext of this...,btohqsg
damn this convo is kinda fun but i'm too busy getting murdered by my work,btohqsg
I feel zl and josh still okay,btohqsg
Nah  I know when to put in hard work if it‚Äôs needed‚Ä¶I just have a problem applying it constantly and not just periodically,btohqsg
Ryan is on the extreme end of like,btohqsg

anyone can put in hard work,btohqsg
im getting shit on wven though i got here a week ago,btohqsg
hope this is a warm welcome,btohqsg
at some point its about capability and competence alr,btohqsg
hard work helps to compensate but usually you cant JUST have hard work,btohqsg
long story short futureofryan is a fkn downie and weird af,btohqsg
For u is just I think u give up too easily. Like i cannot tell if ur joking or not when u complain abt the bell curve thing but like frfr like theres still so much to go on. Life is alr tough enough but u need know to push through and shit like dont say stuff like (oh i fk up here=i got ite) like ur gonna go no where with that,btohqsg
of course i wont go to ITE,btohqsg
but its less funny to be realistic,btohqsg
if people cannot tell u are joking its like not joking la,btohqsg
i also i submit my 100 days advance alr,btohqsg
No I‚Äôm like the type that know enemy is east  but I‚Äôll not fire a single round until the enemy knocks at my doorstep,btohqsg
So I‚Äôm living the risky life,btohqsg
i dont think ive ever had trouble with thati pur everything so bluntly that literally everyone knows im satirical,btohqsg
me trying not to clean rifle after outfield:,btohqsg
ngl this is me also now,btohqsg
yeah but for people who dk u in the future it may rub them the wrong way,btohqsg
I pray that y‚Äôall get put into a position where life just slaps you,btohqsg
i want but idh tbe mental capacity rn,btohqsg
technically 45 days to atec 2 paradise,btohqsg
Maybe ns will wake me up  my Military uncle even told me,btohqsg
u btr wake up before hand,btohqsg
to avoid the shock when u go to ns,btohqsg
NS is probably like the harshest judge of your character,btohqsg
ya sia if u in my unit u cfm fking die,btohqsg
if hes in ANY unit he will die,btohqsg
I had to deal with someone like him from my bmt,btohqsg
we had 5 of him in bmt,btohqsg
i swear ive seen his name before,btohqsg
i just straight up forgot from where,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not dumb  I just selectively choose to be if it allows me a easier time‚Ä¶If being dumb hinders me  I wont be dumb,btohqsg
he believes that u can dont work hard but do well in life.Which frankly enough its definititely possible but its not always the case.,btohqsg
aka u want the easy way out la,btohqsg
i dont think u have that choice in NS dawg üò≠,btohqsg
u easy way out all the way,btohqsg
see whether u can go anywhere,btohqsg
I literally said if I think being dumb hinders me‚Ä¶I won‚Äôt be,btohqsg
ii feel like u dont even know when being dumb hinders u,btohqsg
I know in Ns it hinders me,btohqsg
usually being selectively smart is also a sign of real shit work ethic,btohqsg
but do uk how it hinders u in NS,btohqsg
which would also probably get you slaughtered,btohqsg
When your family has the resources  thinksupposed you are now entrusted with 1 million as the head of the familyWhat are you going to do with it,btohqsg
im lucky cuz im not combat fit,btohqsg
One for all  all for one,btohqsg
Literally nothing  I‚Äôll just let it sit and save,btohqsg
im the type to not like slacking through life,btohqsg
why all the lucky fkers all want to die,btohqsg
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. i guess grass is greener on the other side,btohqsg
cuz i was combat fit for a while also,btohqsg
then i got forced to downpes,btohqsg
grass is greener where you water it,btohqsg
I said I don‚Äôt take risk for a reason,btohqsg
ya thats what people told me also,btohqsg
sit and save is the greatest risk,btohqsg
just taking a risk without knowing it's a risk,btohqsg
i wouldnt mind if i had to up pes,btohqsg
I know it‚Äôs a risk‚Ä¶inflation etc..but the burden I carry if I risk it is too much for me to comprehend,btohqsg
a million dollars is so much money though,btohqsg
it cannot lose that much value,btohqsg
but probably best to invest some of it,btohqsg
then you get a bit of profit,btohqsg
thats what i would probably do,btohqsg
i mean i can acknowledge that for u and zl yalls still in sec sch so its understandable that maybe yall dh the same grasp of the world,btohqsg
if it's too much for you to comprehend  why the hell wouldn't you take the effort to comprehend it,btohqsg
being dumb and lazy is literally hindering you,btohqsg
isnt a million dollars a shit ton of money,btohqsg
to me a million is alot la,btohqsg
when you are a student and your pocket money is in dollars  10000 is also a lot,btohqsg
you could buy an average HDB and still have like a few hundred thousand left over,btohqsg
enough for a 85 yrs old,btohqsg
My idol Warren Buffett not retired at 90,btohqsg
not like you get 1mil and then stop working,btohqsg
I think honestly my mindset is ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be bothered‚Äù‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt be bothered if I become homeless tmr  I can‚Äôt be bothered if I win the lucky prize of 4D‚Ä¶Whatever situation I‚Äôm face with  I‚Äôll just adapt and deal with it to the easiest life I can lead,btohqsg
but I'm already doing what I like  not too much diff from retirement,btohqsg
if youre not bothered by being homeless you probably need to get your mental health in check cos somethings definitely wrong,btohqsg
Not wrong. Yolo also a lifestyle,btohqsg
"no one just ""doesnt bother"" about being homeless",btohqsg
There's people out there who haven't grasped the idea of homelessness because they haven't been threatened by it before,btohqsg
So its not a mental health thing I would say,btohqsg
it's possible. I've friends near my age who are like this,btohqsg
with the social conditioning of this country it would be more plausible for it to be a mental healfh problem,btohqsg
but im not too sure also,btohqsg
but they aren't born with millions,btohqsg
Nah my parents told me they want me out the house by 25,btohqsg
My parents told me that whe I was 13,btohqsg
They said I want u out when u were 13,btohqsg
just can't fathom the idea of trying to lead your easiest life possible and being homeless when you could just yknow,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt blame people for the circumstances I‚Äôm in  I just accept and adapt,btohqsg
not needing to spend is also financially free,btohqsg
not necessarily. Being jailed for life also üòÇ,btohqsg
bc i kinda want that rn,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not dumb enough to not actively avoid being homeless‚Ä¶it‚Äôs just that the thought of it honestly don‚Äôt phase me.If I do  I‚Äôll just adapt‚Ä¶been doing that my whole life  always been inches from less desirable outcomes but I pull myself through by hook or by crook.Already mentioned i will selective choose when to put in the hard work,btohqsg
that's when you are thinking of just yourself,btohqsg
I can differentiate if my decisions affect someone else,btohqsg
the only differentiating you can do is dy/dx,btohqsg
If I know it affects I will take that into consideration‚Ä¶ eg( group project),btohqsg
The life i choose  the life I picked and will be the kind of life I endure,btohqsg
I decided this was how I was going to live my life at that age,btohqsg
Now you know why I‚Äôm confuse if I was sheltered or not,btohqsg
side note  got A lvl H2 Phy prac questions released anywhere ah?,btohqsg
why is money even a measurement of success,btohqsg
Can ask the physics jc chers,btohqsg
like... success is subjective and relative,btohqsg
Because we ascribe value to it,btohqsg
i rather cry in my bed,btohqsg
I wanted to say earlier that most of you prob have been lost at some point of your life ‚Ä¶but I know y‚Äôall prob never have been as lost as me in life.That I want to compete with the poorest of society,btohqsg
Bro just admit u are depressed,btohqsg
thing is people start going so far up their ass trying to be rich as if they even need so much money,btohqsg
Or u have a degradation kink,btohqsg
its not like a generation can plummet society into chaos,btohqsg
I‚Äôm guessing that to‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt have the symptoms of a person that is,btohqsg
I just figured I‚Äôm lost in life,btohqsg
being lost in life is one thing but you do not ever try to compare your feeling of emptiness to others,btohqsg
thats not being lost thats being an asshole,btohqsg
The problem is I‚Äôm not empty‚Ä¶I know what I want to do  where I want to be‚Ä¶ but somehow my actions don‚Äôt replicate with my words,btohqsg
Then how do you explain the fact that my F9 turned to C6 in 3 weeks‚Ä¶Or my A1 turned to F9 in maths in one semI can‚Äôt explain either of it to myself,btohqsg
anyways today confirm will hv drunk female,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not proud I just don‚Äôt know why I could do it in those instance but On a daily I can‚Äôt apply the same pressure on myself,btohqsg
I thought the bell curve isn‚Äôt that drastic,btohqsg
for me not for everyone else,btohqsg
should have gone to poly bro üò≠,btohqsg
i alr know it's not gonna be quiet,btohqsg
confirm 6 calls for the night,btohqsg
That is literally what I‚Äôm confused about‚Ä¶.what actions or thought process did I went through to push that last 3 weeks when I could have done it for 1 month instead or even better the moment i started,btohqsg
nah dont assume lol. i used my o lvl with a lvlmy grades WAS insufficient  my fam and i just found a work around on this,btohqsg
2sir mono ord in Jan ish,btohqsg
My office has 2 2sir ooc fkers,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt look down on the less fortunate they have their reasons‚Ä¶but idk why I‚Äôm constantly trying to compare to them‚Ä¶and my results always reflect it,btohqsg
The other mono intake that just orded,btohqsg
Ask them tell u their enlistment dare,btohqsg
I hope Ns wake me up as wellSince clearly I can‚Äôt do it myself,btohqsg
UOL is fked up sometimes u wanna pull hair,btohqsg
UOL is just messed up in general,btohqsg
waiting for bowling day n  time btw,btohqsg
but for the wrong reason (getting an 87),btohqsg
If I‚Äôm still in this group in 2025‚Ä¶or if it still exist‚Ä¶you will know if ns changed me,btohqsg
I doubt you will still qualify for any with all E8s or F9s with any workarounds.,btohqsg
my sec sch was decent based on maths,btohqsg
use Os to go into bridging then directly into uni,btohqsg

Great insight. Aight now I know I‚Äôma just focus on my poly and disregard everything else,btohqsg

Probability was killing me in poly,btohqsg
Probability is good. It is the essence of everything you do,btohqsg
its always between 0 and 1,btohqsg
probability is the essence of what i do too,btohqsg
relative to 10000 you're not far off,btohqsg
why u like hotwheels so much,btohqsg
i actually like cars..hot wheels is just the cheapest brand with the most acceptable quality when you compare pricing and quality of product,btohqsg
hot wheels quality is just not it man haha,btohqsg

you cant beat it...for the price point,btohqsg
i swear is this broadrick paper 2022 prelim paper,btohqsg
Pray to every god and maths god,btohqsg
I have a classmate that is 30 years old and he has some impeccable wisdom,btohqsg

you can take a ride in castro's old limo as a taxi as well,btohqsg
Fr I thought he was like 175 at first,btohqsg
ironic   saying it to a bunch of sec sch fkers in here,btohqsg
Bruh this is why you don‚Äôt allow guns in the freaking country or state or whatever idk freedom üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏ü¶Öüí•,btohqsg
apparently it was a Awol military officer that did this,btohqsg
His gonna serve a life sentence in jail instead of serving the country,btohqsg
This guy also has not been killed or captured yet,btohqsg
There is a manhunt for him,btohqsg
card with a car with a mag,btohqsg
whn u got maths paper 2,btohqsg
cylinder qns how yall get 528 for last part,btohqsg
this is why u dont give off duty military ppl acess to guns. or btr yet ban guns for everyone.,btohqsg
this is the blank piece of paper,btohqsg
i need the tuition centre ans,btohqsg
maybe you round something too early,btohqsg
i think A1 can say bye but A2 quite possible,btohqsg
i think 9/11 pales in comparison to how i bombed the graph question,btohqsg
i will recreate the events of 6 august 1945,btohqsg
Stay positive A1 cfm can one,btohqsg
goodluck for tomorrow!! (do you even take amath),btohqsg
Honestly b4 I happy alreadly thank goodness eae,btohqsg
A1 can‚Äôt be 90 right üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Then maybe I should be getting my A1,btohqsg
wah piang means i must get 74 MINIMALLY,btohqsg
ok i need to cool off,btohqsg
How did u do for P1,btohqsg
ya but everyone getting like what,btohqsg
then most ppl probably 75 range for p2,btohqsg
or maybe im wildly inflating population average,btohqsg
but the fact is my school standards are so shit yet 1/3 of the people can get 80+ means literally every other school that isnt rabak can probably have 40+ more percent of that,btohqsg
Did u assume one month as 30 days??,btohqsg
i didnt even pit 30 days,btohqsg
you can do [sigma n (x)]/12n,btohqsg
why do you event want to go to tp,btohqsg
make sure you look at all the mods ah,btohqsg
I mean U can consider human resource with psychology,btohqsg
then after that work for abit and then take a  postgrad,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt decide based on distance more on the course that ur int in,btohqsg
pasir ris is a place full of bad bitches-pasir ris man real 2023,btohqsg
im just lucky that the course iw is near LOL,btohqsg
you looked thru all the mods rite,btohqsg
they basically cover most forms of psychology and then you can specialise in behavioural/abnormal or social work type,btohqsg
been a while since i looked at them,btohqsg
give it a few more hours,btohqsg
Wah I gonna sound damn blunt but,btohqsg
Also can't do anyth abt it,btohqsg
So might as well focus for next paper,btohqsg
what can be changed and improved has been done. Next one already.,btohqsg
hi can someone ping me after GP P1 is out,btohqsg
thanks I have no idea how a level works,btohqsg
until they leave the education system they will realise it wont matter,btohqsg
literally next yr at this point in time ur o levels results wont matter,btohqsg
is emath p2 today considered hard,btohqsg
yes  everyone will do badly and bell curve god will smile at everyone.,btohqsg
anybody has p2 ans for emath,btohqsg
E Maths for scoring EsA Maths for scoring As,btohqsg
word of advice for all my stressful individuals  I was once there and ik u may be stressed cus you prolly flunked one of ur L1R5 subjects. but guess what. what matters more is ur gpa and rp rather than ur o level results say fr. so stay positive brothas,btohqsg
anyone got emath p2 ans key,btohqsg
fail english is a no go,btohqsg
Some courses may accept d7 ah,btohqsg
It's either JC (if u got hcl),btohqsg
Tbh btr to check jae booklet,btohqsg

my solar panels i got 3700m¬≤ dawg im cooked üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
shove the solar panel up his mouth and ass bro,btohqsg
Guys anyone else got 85++?? ü§™ü§™,btohqsg
q common if u see in the other chat,btohqsg
I said it as a joke,btohqsg
I misunderstood the above graph  thought it was to collate all the points. Didn't know the final amount at December is meant to be the collated kWh after all 12 months,btohqsg
The thing is the last question the graph is pretty unclear,btohqsg
The person is just stating out why D is the best choice as D uses least number of Panels,btohqsg
He mentioned at his concluding statement saying that he would choose D for what reason,btohqsg
But you need to prove that D is the least number of Panels  hence the table should be shown,btohqsg
o levels results also as impt as gpa/rp,btohqsg
with o level result u can have a choice what to do next,btohqsg
was it just me or the phrasing for the scale question was hella weird,btohqsg
and the EWOS sign on contract formüòÅ,btohqsg
but tbh ah if u cannot handle o lvl den poly/jc gonna be way tough,btohqsg
but say real those taking o lvls   focus on the rest,btohqsg
what is done cannot be undone,btohqsg
better then signing on to mcdonalds,btohqsg
after poly u shud sign on too,btohqsg
u should sign on during y1s1 of poly,btohqsg
to max out your sign on bonus,btohqsg
adf means a dumb fk bro,btohqsg
mr lourdes dcc helped me get a b3 in maths,btohqsg
if everyone dies no one dies,btohqsg
My portfolio im making for my module...,btohqsg
if only u fail  is a you problem  if everybody fail den is the teacher's fault,btohqsg
just think of it that way,btohqsg
they gonna answer for it if whole sg cohort flunk their maths paper,btohqsg
Atp no hope alr for Os,btohqsg
Like i rlly dk whats my fate all the paper super rabak imo ive never felt so shit abt exams,btohqsg
can you tell me bellcurve is gonna be low,btohqsg
josh i saw a lot of ppl on reddit saying paper saying it‚Äôs hard tho,btohqsg
i hope my b3 becomes an A2 or smthg,btohqsg
I really really want to pass,btohqsg
i swear sia if i fail any subject,btohqsg
Got an equal amount say easy also,btohqsg
And the comments is like 600-1000 ppl?,btohqsg
Not enough to determine the difficulty Ygwim,btohqsg
the most vocal ones are the people with grievances,btohqsg
The ppl who do well prolly don‚Äôt even care about the Reddit,btohqsg
or they go just to have fun reading,btohqsg
I think i might js straightaway apply ite if thats possible,btohqsg
every paper according to reddit is hard as fuck,btohqsg
Yeah  reddit is for those that just wants to find comfort for their mistakes tbvh. Sadly it's the reality  those that are good at the subjects will just focus on doing the next paper and not go to reddit to find the answers,btohqsg
like if i were doing o levels rn,btohqsg
i‚Äôd straight up avoid reading the threads,btohqsg
Unless if i rlly try v hard for the next few papers,btohqsg
you should be trying very hard either way,btohqsg
Then i think i can rlly do better for next few papers and rlly rlly push myself and make the last few shots my best one,btohqsg
i cant relate to reddit alr...been ghosting that platform for like a month or two,btohqsg
Bruh how have they not caught this guy,btohqsg
every year this timing same thing,btohqsg
first mass shooting killing more than 10 in 4 years,btohqsg
har i not talking abt ur post,btohqsg
and the general sentiment over it,btohqsg
without exams also they asking about exam questions,btohqsg
before these national exams i alr read of people being burned out or burning out and they are asking for tips,btohqsg
I want d7 for math üò≠,btohqsg
Why is the Reddit so toxic today,btohqsg
they told me my PSLE was the hardest in 10 years..,btohqsg
They even did a CNA episode exactly about PSLE on that very year,btohqsg
i believed it till sec 3..cause if not why would CNA make a whole episode just for it,btohqsg
Idk my frens who retook English said it was easy,btohqsg
I thought first year of the syllabus is always the easiest,btohqsg
Her parents were even self conscious that they were pushing their own kids hard,btohqsg
ngl making an entire post about this is only proving that person's point,btohqsg
just getting baited by people that really don't care about the rant,btohqsg
"I used to comment on instagram and post on reddit  with these type of post but i realise the fact i keep needing to reiterate the fact im not ""blaming others"" or ""others are not wrong""basically told me that..I actually did not fully 100% support what im typing...In that case  i just decided to not post or comment because..If im not 100% behind what im about to post  then what's the point",btohqsg
the person they're trying to direct it to is probs laughing about it,btohqsg
you can tell this post was posted without thought.It is one of those post you just post because you felt like you need to say something just to feel better and not feel oppressed,btohqsg
yea they're just ranting to get it out,btohqsg
like getting the last word in,btohqsg
Whoever that wrote this must've really been pissed off. And like i mean whoever this person was like as if blaming the surrounding liddat,btohqsg
I have never seen a batch of students complain abt a paper this hard before regardless of how difficult the paper is,btohqsg
"And the complaints are ""oh it's different from previous years"" papers like ya no shit what's the point of testing the same things over and over again",btohqsg
Let me js say 07 r the most selfish n think they‚Äôre entitled people,btohqsg
idk y but all of them liddat,btohqsg
Why u making sound like a child predator,btohqsg
Im literally only one year older,btohqsg
There a undeniable shift from 2004 to 2005 kids,btohqsg
2005 2006 2007 onwards are negligible,btohqsg
I don't rmb it being that hard,btohqsg
Honestly I thought we all just trolling after the paper,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not about them being chronically online  it‚Äôs about how they view the world.I can say a lot of them like to try the system after 2004  like they will test and see how far they can go in circumstances and push boundaries,btohqsg
Got a seminar to prep for later,btohqsg
this convo has happened before and you literally agreed. There is a shift...whether its them constantly pushing boundaries or not.I could be wrong  but something about them are diff compared to the 04s and older.Unless you are telling me you are blindly agreeing,btohqsg
Brought out the sources and citations üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
is tht comment section meant to be positive or negative lol. tf is the person trying to say,btohqsg
its pent up annoyance to help them reinforce the fact that SEAB was partially responsible for their uncertainty of not doing well,btohqsg
too many post of that lately. tbh shld jst make a mega thread let everyone rant there.,btohqsg
alot of other non related o level post r not being shown,btohqsg
