I think best is to buy one according to ur current budget. Not future budget. Buy the one u can afford. 500k is over budget in ur current situation..have u ballot for a flat?,btohqsg
People also ought to remember that applicants can appeal but appeal doesn't guarantee a successful outcomeCan try to appeal but should also have backup plansIf your BTO isn't ready until few years later  then do something these few yearsIncrease your income  increase your savings etc,btohqsg
Eh what happened in your case  if you don't mind sharing? Thanks,btohqsg
Are you downgrading or upgrading though?99y lease?,btohqsg
For 55 yo & above  maybe can try Silver Housing grant or bonus thing...,btohqsg
ill try to appeal then to see if it works to get a higher loan with a higher income in the near future before key collection,btohqsg
If the HFE scheme was implemented to close a loophole in the HLE scheme  be prepared for backup plan to address any potential challenges in the future.,btohqsg
High grant and high loan amount,btohqsg
How so though? Any source for this? ThanksSeems like whether for HLE or HFE  it would be -Income lower - higher grant  lower loanIncome higher - lower grant  higher loanBoth are tied to incomeHFE gives an overview of all the finances all at once whereas in HLE  components are broken upUnless the situation is  for the same assessed income  applicant is getting a lower loan amount under HFE  as compared to if they had applied through HLE,btohqsg
For HLE  if it was one working and one studying  they could get high grant when they applied.Subsequently nearer to key collection with both working and HDB reassessment of income  they could get high loan for their unit.,btohqsg
That was the loophole in the past which HFE is trying to correct.,btohqsg
Fiance / fiancee scheme or applies to all?When are grants disbursed under HFE under normal circumstances? Before lease signing?,btohqsg
How is that a loophole? If they have higher salary  than before when reasses why cant they get a higher loan?,btohqsg
For example when they first applied maybe they are just starting working. And maybe they waited for the bto to complete in 7 years  surely their income is higher when reasses,btohqsg
I think it was using the fiance fiancee scheme.This is for HLE time  not HFE,btohqsg
pre-covid and years before  build times were actually 3-4 years,btohqsg
Would like to check anyone know if bto completing end of this year  my kid can register his primary school this yr with the new address?,btohqsg
In any case  now they will just take the loan amount in your HFE. So better budget properly with the current eligible loan amount. Otherwise the shortfall have to pay with cash,btohqsg
yes though I agree with you on this  HDB doesn't see it that way currently.,btohqsg
i think there may be a way...best to call the school itself to check this...and also check MOE website....there r certain conditions..like proof of docs,btohqsg
Is it? I saw one at yishun aranda breeze. 7 years to complete by 2028. Launch in 2022.,btohqsg
2022 is still considered covid period,btohqsg
Even for HLE  doesn't sound like there is really reassessment unless applicant appeals for higher loan(again  appeal does not necessarily mean outcome must be successfulMore like renewal...If income is lower as compared to the past  loan amount eligible will be reviewed and probably be loweredIf income stays the same or is higher as compared to the past  no change to loan amount eligible,btohqsg
There is for HLE. They did not need to appeal back then.Currently what you're saying here is what HFE is doing: If income is lower as compared to the past  loan amount eligible will be reviewed and probably be loweredIf income stays the same or is higher as compared to the past  no change to loan amount eligible,btohqsg
U may read more here as i also have a child so i already study all this,btohqsg
Income stays the same or becomes higher and no change to loan amount eligible is also what i have been hearing about HLE though,btohqsg
Yes. This is the projects that take super duper long. Around 6-7years. Even the feb 2024 is faster. Woodgrove edge is projected to complete in 2027.,btohqsg
I see... But I have heard otherwise as well. Maybe in those cases I've heard  their original loan amount was unable to cover up previously  hence with the income reassessment  HDB increased it automatically.,btohqsg
Yes but that specific person also should understand the build time. It's not as if HDB hides it from them... The choice to bid for a certain project is up to the buyer and he/she should do their due diligence (make their bed and lay in it).,btohqsg
Yes. I understand ur point. My point is that while waiting for the bto surely their salary would increase,btohqsg
yes. But HDB does not seem to want to increase the loan quantum because they now show what you are eligible upfront BEFORE you select your flat. I think they assume that people will make decisions based on their current loan quantum  but it seems otherwise from the ground sentiment.,btohqsg
Hdb rules is quite confusing nowadays. üòÖ,btohqsg
And quite really  no review / reassessment / renewal for HFE when nearing key collection doesn't quite make sense tooSome things don't change whether it is HLE or HFE eraHFE is not some magic that guarantees an appliant's ability to repay loan stays the same throughoutThere will be some applicants whose income are somewhat adversely affected for various reasons  unexpectedly,btohqsg
Yeah. Anything can happen during the waiting period of waiting for the bto to complete,btohqsg
yes it is... and they don't put out official statements when they make subtle changes.,btohqsg
Yes it doesn't.. But there are alternatives like bank loan available  it's not a dead end I guess...,btohqsg
How is this different from HLE then?,btohqsg
Welcome. because of the 30months staying period is quite ridiculous la  no wonder no couples want to wait for BTO ready then have kids by the time age also catching up  no wonder fertility so lowMy child will be K1 almost K2 when my BTO is completed then waiting for Pri school is 12 months+ so the 30 Months not met also siao one,btohqsg
It's not supposed to be that much different. The difference should have only been for applicants to know how much loan and grant they are eligible for upfront instead of in stages like in HLE.,btohqsg
Worse... People would share on reddit or elsewhere that different HDB officers might give different answers for the same question because their understanding or interpretation of what HDB would do differs from person to person,btohqsg
btw  I don't work for HDB ah. Just thinking from their perspective based on their press releases.,btohqsg
Loan is the variable but under HLE  people are supposed to have a valid HLE at the point of application tooAs for grant  information is out in the publicApplicants can also estimate their grant amount beforehand,btohqsg
Estimate yes but it may differ. So now HDB frontload all the anxiety inducing details to you liao so that you can make a more informed financial decision on your purchase üòÇ,btohqsg
Anyways  there is nothing we can do individually to change their stance. You wanna send in petition?,btohqsg
To some extent  i feel like not that much difference between HLE and HFEAnd HFE might have came about due to internal changes within HDBInstead of 5 pax doing grant and 5 pax doing loan  now all 10 pax doing both tasksMAYBE,btohqsg
never try never know  maybe become like SimplyGo?üòè,btohqsg
idk... and I don't wanna presume how they work.,btohqsg
How they work is u just follow our rules. U like it or not just FOLLOW. lol,btohqsg
Eh  those note applicable for BTO project? How I gonna stay there for 30 mths if I am getting my key within 2 years? üòÇ,btohqsg
That is why MAYBEBecause can't see significant difference between how HLE and HFE really affects applicants so farOther than system crashing more badly than during HLE eraü´¢,btohqsg
