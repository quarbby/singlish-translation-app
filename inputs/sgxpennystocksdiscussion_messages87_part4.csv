Who the small buyers? Care to share?,btohqsg
int cement break out at 64  can it hold ?? or retest 69 again !!,btohqsg
AMPLEFIELD lai 1 mouth break 37???,btohqsg
Never show me the counter party leh. Scb app,btohqsg
What are the signs that JT is currently displaying ?,btohqsg
If contra i think can aim 85-86...if long term 9-10cents,btohqsg
GKE must prepare to hold 1...slow and steady building up...latest sharebuybacks 500lot 80,btohqsg
im vested... dun know if should sell?,btohqsg
Amplefieldbroke out of blue downtrend line after approaching the apex. indicators turning positive  likely to test the upper blue trend line at 42 region.note the long VOP bar at 30-32 region suggest accumulation at that region. above 36 are all short VOP bars  looks to be minimal resistance on the way up. ball in their court  let;s see,btohqsg
gonna make their decision soon. reaching apex,btohqsg
means up or downread your view on MT ytd quite accurate,btohqsg
can explain more. reach apex is good?,btohqsg
slowly approaching apex. so a big move is imminent. be it breakout or downupward bias due to corporate development.,btohqsg
Yesterday all weak hands of Matex flushed,btohqsg
Nvm Nxt one! U also huat many counters already,btohqsg
haha huat ahbut bullets all at JT and MT. so only can see,btohqsg
Dont worry will come go up...GKE price Bbs controlled very well,btohqsg
GKE. since breakdown GMMA (red box) in march and breakout (may) the stock has been on uptrend for 5 months. now is on brink of a big breakout still resisted by the horizontal and VOP R 82. disposal of VDH warehouse in shanghai progression will be an immediate catalyst,btohqsg
Int cement second round  pinky power not over yet,btohqsg
1 shot to $1 a bit tough.. $1.1 maybe possible,btohqsg
Hey furion  noob qn. how is the horizontal and vop resistance determined?,btohqsg
MATEX break 40 can run good,btohqsg
horiontal based on the highs formed by previous candlesVOP is volume on priceas name suggest  the longer the bar  the more volume traded at this price level. so if VOP is at high  suggest distribution/ stuckist at this price level.,btohqsg
yet if it can hold there long enough  will suggest stuckist/ distribution shares being taken over by another strong hands. so the verdict is still out for GKE. i am upward bias,btohqsg
because has been hovering at resistance for quite awhile,btohqsg
May I know that the TP for Matex?,btohqsg
Since the recent high is arnd 0.09  is that considered the next resistance if 82 breaks through?,btohqsg
Thx sir furion. Im like back to school for lecturesü§£,btohqsg
Your this counter always one mouth one! üòÜ,btohqsg
i wont look too much into that since it is clearly a fluke or maybe wide spread poke by 100 share type. but still a reference point of course,btohqsg
meanwhile got this monster here... slowly wait la haha,btohqsg
I think your explanation makes sense. If BBs simply want to distribute then the price doesnt need to retest 82 so many times and stay rangebound for so long,btohqsg
Holding well today. Hope it stays that way,btohqsg
case of bull bear fight. cheering for bulls,btohqsg
Agv no action liao.? So fast sia,btohqsg
JT... Should move towards 100 before result early next month,btohqsg
Safer to go in after it breaks resistance or drop back to support arnd 75/76 i assume?,btohqsg
Wastwd ..sold off one parcel yestersay,btohqsg
This is really mind game  this morning JT keep showing weak buy force,btohqsg
break resistance chase is breakout trading. buy at support and wait is positioning trading. no better ways  depending your own style. buy 83 u scalp. positioning expects higher returns simply due to more time and capital involved,btohqsg
Me too  I like to read quietly on furion‚Äôs analysis,btohqsg
seems you got a better chance trading A stocks in market,btohqsg
Weak but didn't drop.. that's why looks like accumulation..,btohqsg
Should test 40/41 soon and if break nice can run 45 or more I reckon.,btohqsg
They collected a lot and earlier mouthed 39 also . This one BBs toy .,btohqsg
Good that Amplefield heartbeat is back. It‚Äôs alive. Out from its coma finally üôèüèª,btohqsg
JT holder u all feel shiok a not?,btohqsg
ok added 39 matex support all hope all haut,btohqsg
More to come...more to come..load up!!!,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know how he did it but he did it,btohqsg
