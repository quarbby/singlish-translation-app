Yes I used this. The limit was BHS - my existing amount in MA,btohqsg

Has anyone uses tiger broker cash boost account with CDP linkage to sell their SG shares residing in CDP? How is the experience?,btohqsg
Your $8k is already part of your FRS. Why will only be $4k? It will be $12k withdrawable. Unless can't hit FRS  most should be able to withdraw amounts above FRS.,btohqsg
I can tell you that in this group chat  at least once a day. Really need everyone to help ping admins if any unwanted content like porn or scam.,btohqsg
Assuming your SA is beyond FRS at 55  your RA will be formed with RSTU (and its interests) + mandatory contributions to SA (FRS - RSTU).Excess mandatory contributions to SA will go into OA unless you transfer to RA  and whatever is in OA is withdrawable anytime.,btohqsg
No but you restrict the monies to be used for OA usages like HDB or education loan. In exchange you get 1.5% p.a. more.,btohqsg
Use another card to top-up TnG card instead?,btohqsg
Just follow CardUp's instructions  they will provide the recommended date for deduction. IRAS will do the resolution backend to check if you've paid or not.Remember that Jan's deduction is for Feb's payment. So GIRO will still be deducted for Jan's payment  if you cannot setup to make payment for next week.,btohqsg
If your MA haven't hit BHS and you haven't hit annual tax relief cap  why not?,btohqsg
$8k tax relief cap from RSTU and VCMA is separate from annual CPF contribution cap.,btohqsg
This is for topping-up of CPF accounts  not VCMA or RSTU.,btohqsg
For the past 12 months  most banks have started doing this due to security. You're better off leaving the limits untouched once you change or changing it earlier.,btohqsg
Yes  do remember 1 Jan is PH  so it'll be counted as $0 for that day. Make sure you clear all amounts on 1 Feb morning as it's a Saturday.,btohqsg
why would this be troublesome?the troublesome is if they decide to HOLD the transfer pending a phone verification,btohqsg
Nothing more troublesome than setting up interbank GIRO with DBS ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,btohqsg
Thanks melvyn for the confirmation. Noted on the 1st jan counting. Dont have a choice as i need dec to be exactly $0,btohqsg
Can I check   I am claiming my gift for Citi reward card but need to spend to redeem gift within 1 mth. If I use amaze (tag on Citi reward) is it consider eligible transaction?,btohqsg

Can UOB ppv be used for Apple online store?,btohqsg
I did the math  you'll lose $20 of interest if you put in on 2 Jan instead of 31 Dec.,btohqsg
Best to check if t&c states Amaze transactions is excluded or not.,btohqsg
Thanks. But i need to meet my $500 save in ocbc. So i dont have a choice. My calculation is exactly $501 increase,btohqsg
Ah sad. Better to lose $20 than $120.,btohqsg
DBS fixed D interest rate drop:https://www.dbs.com.sg/iwov-resources/pdf/deposits/10dec2024-dbs-notice.pdf,btohqsg
Hmm maybe you went to the VCMA top up page?,btohqsg
Thanks! Ya  I call again and double confirm everything above FRS is withdrawable,btohqsg
Even if u have made rstu? As long above all can take out?,btohqsg
That depends on how much is your total RSTU + interests earned,btohqsg
Hi experts May I check who is eligible for cash top up for self CPF MA?My CPF portal only allows top up to SA.,btohqsg
top up MA is a different route from top up SA. could that be the reason?,btohqsg
Did you try the top up your medisave link instead?https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/growing-your-savings/saving-more-with-cpf/top-up-your-medisave-savings,btohqsg
Anyway as long as you work for life. It is mathematically impossible for your rtsu to be more than your salary SA contribution.,btohqsg
My understanding  pls correct me if I am wrong. For eg. SA account( 400k from normal work contribution  100k from rstu + int)  Assuming frs is 450k  your FRS will be formed first by 100k from rstu+ 350k from normal work contribution  therefore u can withdraw 50k. BUT if your work contribution is 400k  rstu +int is 500k  u can only withdraw 400 k since rstu cannot be withdrawn even if it is higher than frs 450k.,btohqsg
Your theory is correct but in reality  this may never happen,btohqsg
In theory yes cuz apple store mcc is within UOB ppv online whitelist. However  there was dp apple store charging card as offline transaction. ðŸ¥²Better just paywave at the store if possible,btohqsg
RSTU+RSTU interest = reserved amounts = reserved for RA = CPF Life annuity at 65 (non withdrawable at will  only monthly payouts)This is what CPF means when they say RSTU top up cannot be withdrawn,btohqsg
But the reality is most people's RSTU Funds will never hit above FRS (unless maxed out at birth age 0),btohqsg
Hi next year top up parent's cpf gov matching grant increased from 600 to 2000 but no more tax relief. what is your take on this? i have been contributing 600 every year for the past 5 years. unsure whether want to continue next year since no more tax relief.,btohqsg
RSTU/VCMA to their accounts instead? Policies change  just adapt.,btohqsg
