Strategies that worked in low interest environment will fail badly during increasing interest period. If cannot unwind  will get burnt deep deep.,btohqsg
For 20 years  loan is king. Going forward  cash is god,btohqsg
You declares more . You loan out the money . Make sure you able to service the debt situation.. I kanna almost bankruptcy once when I was 23..  learn for people go lend money from bank to buy property.. I kanna margin call to top up 300k  for the property that I bought .. cos I remember that time market suddenly down alot .. Lucky my mother save me ..,btohqsg
Margin call is no joke. Your whole world crashing around you. Like drowning in quick sand,btohqsg
no wonder u cautious but margin calls i would say were for those days  not completely impossible but with those safety nets in place nw  gov can easily remove them to spur the market,btohqsg
Every call  every letter also scare to get,btohqsg
Think long liao  jump from top floor,btohqsg
tsdr n msr not ther for show  in a way also filter out though not 100% esp for those self employed,btohqsg
anyway u experience lao jiao  nxt time after ns muz look for u,btohqsg
I have 6 friend kanna bankruptcy .. 2 jump down .. 4 still around .. I witnessed this all .. don play with fire .. buy property no as easy as we seem .. there is alot of term and conditions,btohqsg
true but nowadays diff from ur days earlier.. nt easy but dont complicate it,btohqsg
Government policy can only help so much... Those oneself chiong extreme  gov see liao also will not help one,btohqsg
Now safety net also not use if your back grounds not Much spare cash to support ..,btohqsg
ya eod  not envocating to go all out  still within own limits,btohqsg
Actually is the same .. things get expensive .. alot of people now still getting high loan .. 30 percent down payment the most,btohqsg
personally feel tat fed will only increase for this yr  followin 1-2 yrs at least will maintain n start tone down,btohqsg
High inflation actually good for young people just starting work. Bad for retiring folks,btohqsg
actuali thers still alot cash rich.. ec 1st buyers easily earn 6 digits for 1st buyers,btohqsg
If alot of people feel this and there .. thing won't get so difficult Liao ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Market not crash  will not stop,btohqsg
Cash rich of course ok .. if those average working class .. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
He is ready to press the button.. to me I believe property have a cycles . Of course will not go down alot ..,btohqsg
Got case just put FD  risk free 4-5%  don't need to bother with all the market turbulence,btohqsg
jus go do a deep search on the debt usa holdin,btohqsg
SVB collapse brought another risk to the financial system due to high interest environment,btohqsg
Fed doesn't care the debt. For past 100 years never see them pay,btohqsg
Yes .. look at all the salary or the past few here till now .. how many percent increase .,btohqsg
Can see the end of USD era liao  just like how GBP was dethroned,btohqsg
infact mayb cos came across alot average ppl earning 6 figure frm their bto or ec sales haha ,btohqsg
n when i say average  its reaali average,btohqsg
Wait for more and more companies to tighten wallets... Until hit the common class population  then everything also crash,btohqsg
If they have 2 property ..yes they earning .. but sell high buy high .. end of the day you still own 1 property. . with higher debt ..,btohqsg
the key thing is 1st buyer.. not resales in a normal market,btohqsg
For example .. for my case .  I have 1 HDB and 1 condo only .. if I sell my HDB now .. yes I earn 6 figure hard cash in my pocket .. then I move to my condo stay ..,btohqsg
til the max u can afford  then time to downgrade n free up e cash,btohqsg
Now still good price  should consider offloading to keep cash,btohqsg
