Korea & HK also not bad.,btohqsg
Or they js wna rip yâ€™all off.,btohqsg
idk how the taste will be like tho. I hope it is nice.,btohqsg
Would y'all rather hireSomeone whoâ€™s already competent in the job and can do everything already (but highest edu is ITE)OrA person who just graduated from Uni,btohqsg
which matters more experience or education,btohqsg
ok example in engineering sector then,btohqsg
wah not so...direct eh i feel,btohqsg
depends on the level of precision for the job. both study same thing but ones more detailed,btohqsg
imo to move up to some higher roles probably edu will become more important   i can help you ask my engineer friends ah if you need,btohqsg
den what's diff between ite n uni student,btohqsg
something i didnâ€™t see being brought up is that uni is sort of proof of being able to pick up things at a high level,btohqsg
almost all your work stuff is picked up on the job and even if you have experience this is smth that employers look for,btohqsg
like sure you can be ITE and just as capable but to someone looking through your resume  a degree is tangible proof,btohqsg
not even ITE but someone that works right after poly and never goes uni will hit a wall in terms of career growth,btohqsg
itâ€™s why so many people go for degree for the piece of paper,btohqsg
or even why people go for masters tbh cos a lot of jobs are locked behind that paper,btohqsg
and then you go for a phd and youâ€™re overqualified ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
ye  im playing it on hard mode at the moment,btohqsg
I'm playing it based on luck ðŸ’€,btohqsg
you may think it should only apply to these kinds but in reality itâ€™s the same perception everywhere,btohqsg
what made some of y'all choose to go uni,btohqsg
did well in psle -> went IP -> auto A levels -> natural path,btohqsg
i never really had a chance to consider whether to go,btohqsg
it was go or get stuck with PSLE cert,btohqsg
given a choice would u have done things differently?,btohqsg
and even during my bachelors i got rejected from internships cos of my A levels at times,btohqsg
take o levels and see my feels,btohqsg
Itâ€™s weird to say i wish i took o levels lmao but itâ€™s a good age to think about what path you wanna go,btohqsg
he can do things as well as a 5 yr engineer in service,btohqsg
imo it saved me a fair bit of headache also,btohqsg
but thatâ€™s knowing how competent he is. on paper itâ€™s hard to tell,btohqsg
u wan know why I like ns ?,btohqsg
he cant do theory but can do practicial,btohqsg
then uni student can't do prac but can do theory,btohqsg
Natural next step + parental expectations + self expectations,btohqsg
yea and kinda hard to know this from resume + interview,btohqsg
and having proven to have the ability to learn theory is important in stem especially,btohqsg
cuz yall guys get to have 2 yrs to think of what course to choose etc. but girls NOPE u nid to choose next yr else gap yr,btohqsg
thatâ€™s why they tend to get trusted more with higher positions,btohqsg
nothing wrong with gap year tho,btohqsg
iâ€™d even advice it at timesn,btohqsg
but u see u barely earn anyth,btohqsg
if u are gonna be laze,btohqsg
I know but alot of girls no offense doesnt work,btohqsg
if they gonna be laze then thatâ€™s their problem,btohqsg
no bro...it is once in a lifetime...,btohqsg
do u ever wanna go back sch?,btohqsg
but for me when i give career advice to girls  itâ€™s always making sure they donâ€™t jump into uni rushing,btohqsg
if they not ready to decide for sure then donâ€™t,btohqsg
so many people go into JC cos they dk what they wanna do yet,btohqsg
