macbook is better if u write a lot,btohqsg
And have a lot of files,btohqsg
Like ipad u can write ur own notes,btohqsg
Mac because school might need to use some software only computer can do that,btohqsg

What do u want to do with the device?,btohqsg

Macbook Air is just a laptop,btohqsg
It's perfectly suitable if you want to code  surf internet  etc,btohqsg
iPad is a tablet  so doing laptop work on it is more difficult,btohqsg
but writing on it is much better than on laptop,btohqsg
there are alternatives for writing notes also  such as using a drawing tablet,btohqsg
cuz like everything in poly is like softcopy so cant rlly take notes on the laptop,btohqsg

Esp if all you're doing is just taking notes  writing documents  using internet  etc,btohqsg
Like iOS I prefer it over android,btohqsg
