If you build the engine right actually usually won‚Äôt burn oil that fast de actually .. those burn oil usually either got oil leakage or engine internal have issues,btohqsg
I not sure also la. Nv play before. But from what I hear is B16 and D16 if open VTEC they need to burn EO. So of course poorly maintained one will burn more EO than a well maintained one.,btohqsg
