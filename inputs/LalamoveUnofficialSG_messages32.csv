I just feel now delivery so common   grace period shd be at least 20mins would be good. Thats why orchard orders no one wanna take if given a choice,btohqsg
If no priority I won‚Äôt go,btohqsg
Did you often complete job or press pick up only after u have left the location?,btohqsg
Sg just generally not very convenient for such things  sometimes want stop somewhere quickly to check something also so difficultHaiz,btohqsg
Yeah like max 5 mins after I leave the place,btohqsg
"Did you get the pop up msg saying something like ""it seems you are not at the location "" etc etc",btohqsg
Oh... Guess only lala has the answer to the mystery lol,btohqsg
I read somewhere that if you set your phone to airplane mode  might kena,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm using TPG line. No service when I‚Äôm in lifts and inside basement carparks. Could that be the reason?,btohqsg
Why would anyone need to set airplane mode for lalamove ü§îI mean ppl used to do that for grab to cheat ard the set destination,btohqsg
Erm  are they not telling you the reason? Lol,btohqsg
Idk leh. Hahah that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt think of what I did that lead to a suspension lol. Kept pestering live chat  they keeps saying relevant department will get back to me -./,btohqsg
Having said that LLM APP only sg user must Bao Ka Liao,btohqsg
Cuz u see other countires i think can charge for carpark n tolls fee,btohqsg

I am sure we can figure something out  so far the pick up time  destinations setting has been working correctly from the comments of other users.üëåMay i know did you encounter any other problems? We keep updating our app on a daily basis to meet your needs‚ù§‚ù§,btohqsg
Many users shared the same worry of you  but through out our 5 years operation in different countries  0 driver was banned!!!üòäüòäActually we were thinking about simplfing the app for the sg users as some replys suggested that they were not familiar with the app (Of course you can find me to helpüòä)  but maybe adding more criteria would suit you better? If that is true please let us know so that we can change the app for youüí™üí™üôÜ   !!!,btohqsg

True  i asked cs to helped me cancel as customer did not request for helper to hold on 60 flower pots in the van  so we are not willing to do  ask them to cancel unable to as they said they as cs only liased with cust. for driver needs to live chat  their live chat is dead  no1 attending to it. so called customer we cant cancel  customer helped us cancelled on their side as she can do it she said. luckily....,btohqsg
Actually the live chat  its a bit slow but usually will get connected if u wait abt 10-15min,btohqsg
Bro I enquired to change from bike to van before. In the previous app there was an email/contact form button. I submitted through there  they replied the next working day or so. Maybe can try find an email address,btohqsg

Outside guard house no inside guard house yes,btohqsg
How they earn $5000 fare so low,btohqsg
Pickupp got any registration fee or deposit fee like lalamove?,btohqsg
Last time no  now I don't know,btohqsg
But really no point register  charles and keith delivery only $2.50 per dropoff how to do sia,btohqsg
Ya really dont bother  waste your time and phone memory. I believe lalamove is the only one that calculates fare by distance,btohqsg
Other platforms  u send bedok to town is $8  u send bedok to woodlands also $8,btohqsg
Do llm never get today try whyQ get heng heng üòÅ,btohqsg
i looked up whyq and pickupp. cant find how much they pay. they reveal their rider rates only after sign up?,btohqsg
I can show u the price,btohqsg
WhyQ base $8.50  $4.50 per drop  $0.30/km  20 mins waiting + $2. Commission is 10%. This was what they told us when I joined last yr lah.After doing for a few months  I realised WhyQ if kena multidrop  more worth than llm  BUT llm sometimes got the LLM subsidy thing. So in conclusion  both end up about the same.Only real advantage with taking whyq order on their app is you get to see the job first. After 15min if no WhyQ rider take they push to LLM.,btohqsg
Hope this helps anyone looking at WhyQ,btohqsg
Thx Khai! whyq pay is surprisingly competitive.,btohqsg
Officially I dunno bro but I got see some people do,btohqsg
Work as long n when u can or fix time period like food panda? Thanks,btohqsg
Like when you want lor. But whyq jobs only available during lunch and dinner. They operate from hawker centres,btohqsg
Food panda is more petrol/diesel friendly.,btohqsg
panda dont use as much petrol coz distances much shorter... but the frequent start-stop actually really bad for engine.,btohqsg
one day easily crank 50+ times.,btohqsg
During CB I tried lalamove with car,btohqsg
Due to too much start off engine?,btohqsg
Haha end up that one month make 3k plus extra  all donate to worksjop,btohqsg

I got a job everymorning 530am pick up 50 bento boxes from taiseng send to holland & bukit timah. $40 daily.. is it too low,btohqsg
I think u get it wrong. The job doesn't earn 140. Is because of purchase services. He pay for the item first then customer paylah him the delivery fee and the purchase item together,btohqsg
So this job how much should i charge   anybody can advise market price,btohqsg
Should charge at least 50 to 60,btohqsg
Buy item $114 she pay me plus dilivery $27 total $140,btohqsg
Wow this ShinShin shop lady very rude,btohqsg
Flower vendor didnt settle fees with tips since CNY eve. Already called CS thrice and the vendor said will settle. CS cant do anything about it. Should I send in that Cai Shen Ye debt collection service?,btohqsg

No spec one ok one leh i go there many times,btohqsg

I think ok ba if you intend to start in the central,btohqsg
At least your day start with 40 bucks,btohqsg
What she do? Both of them Ok leh,btohqsg
Wants a car willing to take motor fee.,btohqsg
This woman ordered a MPV for 75.5kg of paper documents. 7boxes and 3 big plastic bags.,btohqsg
And had to walk up and down 4 flights of stairs to deliver to the 3rd floor.,btohqsg
And when I asked her to send screenshot as proof of payment  she complained to cs that I was harassing her -.- wtf,btohqsg
It's a credit order? Why screenshot?,btohqsg
Actually i finally understand why got ppl will put such remarksCos its a viamove orderViamove doesn't charge by veh type  only item dimensions,btohqsg
So when customer book  they no need to choose vehWhat veh they get is po heng suay,btohqsg
Why need proof when its a credit order?,btohqsg
Who took this 5 box order,btohqsg
I rejected as he put car,btohqsg
He cancel then book again car,btohqsg
Called CS and CS ask me ask customer cancel.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a cash. The new order put credit because she already PayLah! the first amount,btohqsg
i only got the bronze one. looks like better not to accept the mission if i cant complete it.,btohqsg
Suddenly got subsidy then u regret üòÅ,btohqsg
really dont think i can do 40 in those 4 days though  even with subsidy.,btohqsg
To be honest I no confident also üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Still got 40 to get $65 Shag üôà,btohqsg
If accept mission but never clear will have penalty???,btohqsg
No penalty some more upgrade u to silver üòÜ,btohqsg
Wtf  why need to provide services for this type of AssO... No basic respect... üò°,btohqsg
Obviously many drivers and riders have shown that kind of lousy behaviour towards them first,btohqsg
It can also be their attitude towards riders or drivers.,btohqsg
The way the remarks are written describes something that has happened... If its jus their own attitude it would be worded differently,btohqsg
"It would be stated as some kind of ""terms & conditions""  eg ""No negotation""  ""No detour"" ""Do not xxxx""",btohqsg
You may not be that kind of driver and find it ridiculous that any driver might behave that way  but it's actually quite common and i can totally imagine drivers going there complaining abt the job even tho they accepted it,btohqsg
It also might be the item or the job isn't what they describe so drivers say cannot do?  Yes something may happen but that doesn't give them the right to say that's kind of words in the description,btohqsg
If they scare drivers cannot send. Then send it themself. Then they won't be piss off when driver accept the job but cannot do,btohqsg
the size and weight limits are clearly stated for each vehicle type. quite sure the complaints are bcoz the job is clearly over limit.,btohqsg
Hi my order just got cancelled  and then i contacted my client but he said he thought it was me who cancelled it  do you guys know what happened? Would it affect me?,btohqsg
U need to go few step to cancel pick not that easy,btohqsg
I logged late fees then order got cancelled. The customer thought I cancelled the order. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ,btohqsg
Lala cancelled I think. Happened to me last week. Food not ready then was waiting for around 27 mins. Took pic to complete loading got error them later saw order gone went under cancelled tab. Had to livechat to get back the order.,btohqsg
Waa i saw one order pioneer road to expo only $22,btohqsg
üì£ WARNING TO ALL LALAMOVE DRIVERSWhat is MOD?MOD is a third-party application for filtering orders with certain criteria (for example  high value orders) and delivering those orders faster to the shipping partner who uses them.  This will affect your income as a Lalamove shipping partner.What action will Lalamove take?We will take decisive action by constantly monitoring fellow shoppers suspected of using the MOD every week and they will be blacklisted from serving with Lalamove if found guilty.  Blackout friends who have been blacklisted will not be able to withdraw their cash in Lalamove wallets.  These efforts will continue to combat the use of MOD and ensure equal order taking opportunities for all Lalamove shipping partners.  If you have any information about MOD users  please share detailed information about suspects using MOD  such as name  phone number  vehicle number  etc. by filling out this form,btohqsg

Wolf73we strongly prohibit the distribution of mods of any kinds here.,btohqsg
^ which stop is the secured zone?,btohqsg
haha so can expect better orders from tmr?,btohqsg
also means 700+ riders will have this week's earnings absorbed by LLM  since it takes 1 week to cash out.,btohqsg
How come so many using it üòÇ,btohqsg
confess i was tempted coz the llm interface is so bad. no filters  no pause  nothing. but the helper asked for password so i decided too risky.,btohqsg
@tovix_1168this is your convo with cs? Or fwd from other ppl,btohqsg
The app also not much use.,btohqsg
Got use also shouldnt use lol üòÜ,btohqsg

Reaching the pizza place  collected food  when I wanted to take picture  realised user cancelled,btohqsg
If lalamove didn't have the take loading picture  I would have driven to destination without knowing I did for free,btohqsg
I inform lalamove  then realised new job no was re assigned to me  same job  same place  same recipient  but fare $15,btohqsg
I called pizza place  the user told me this was the job she posted,btohqsg
To think I ran to the pizza place   take the order  risk lta  cancel my job  run back to them to return,btohqsg
And last they only wanted to pay half of the new fare,btohqsg
I don't want to say full name,btohqsg
If me I rather give back the pizza and lepak one corner,btohqsg
Lucky have the loading function where we have to take pictures,btohqsg
Never have a good experience with yellow cab pizza,btohqsg
It's so sketchy   the whole incdent,btohqsg
