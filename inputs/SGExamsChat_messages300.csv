i dont take econs can you spare the technical terms HAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
If you want to take just take  why bother if other's do it? haha,btohqsg
I've only known people that retook As  not Os  but most of them did use some external help e.g. tuition  but for the one that I know didn't did improve by 1 grade? There's quite a few posts on retaking on the subreddit  so you can look for it! :),btohqsg
Yea me I took Os last year,btohqsg
I self study  v ex if wanna go institution,btohqsg
Ofc that being said I have tuition this year unlike last year,btohqsg
My L1R5 for Os was 26,btohqsg
Actually to retake  I just briefly looked the poly courses n since theres not much I just whack and wait till they accept me then I reject the enrolment package(this one need to call them/or they will call you to double confirm ur not gonna take up the course),btohqsg
Do anyone have notes for hist paper 2?,btohqsg
For me it was the immense pressure from studying in express classes. Then  I wasn't in the right mind either lol my mind couldn't take the pressure.,btohqsg
Cause I transferred to express class  then I didn't know the pace would be that fast. Personally  there's not enough time to relax or settle in tbh,btohqsg
Was forcing myself to study at that point yada yada boom here,btohqsg
I retook every subj  only had tuition for 2 subj,btohqsg
Rest is either last min crash course/free tuition etc. thru reddit,btohqsg
Idk for other sch but for mine  to retake in my sch  need to meet its criteria like u fail english and 2 other subjevts,btohqsg
But unfortunately I didn't  lol but ngl  I was planning to study at home anw,btohqsg
If ur planning to retake hor and u didn't meet ur sch criteria to retake  you needa consider no. Of subjects ur retaking  the price of those subjects. Btw there's also application fee or smth,btohqsg
Cos my sch Cher told me to  since he confirmed with me that I was retaking so those are the steps to take to ensure I can become a private candidate,btohqsg

for econs no need example bah js need a lot of key terms u mess up concept ur paper die,btohqsg
Nah i rather learn geog theory than econs,btohqsg
some what easier to understand yeah,btohqsg
ehh ur pw how’s it gg,btohqsg
my tcher remarks damn lame hahaha,btohqsg
we dk what to change alr,btohqsg
My take on Econs since taking it years ago.It helps me understand the economy at an earlier age  and I was able to use the theory to invest in certain companies/stocks effectively,btohqsg
Its usage extend far beyond A Level,btohqsg
Last time there is no H2  but is as good as H2 level,btohqsg
My time H3 was called S paper.,btohqsg
H2 was introduced only in 2007 A level,btohqsg
since then there was 2 syllabus changes I think  at least for JC Physics,btohqsg
Also  if you ever require tuition or books help  it is generally easier to find for econs than for geography.Even for free materials  I find it easier to find for econs. Many famous textbooks around that will help.,btohqsg
At least that was how I brought my A level econs from E at J2 mid years to A by A level  all by finding materials that were around the school library  and a few from the internet.,btohqsg
been quite a while since logic gates lolIt is more Venn diagrams these days,btohqsg

But ofc the score is simplified  alot of bars removed cause its too fast and it exceeded the timing for syf piece,btohqsg
the starting melody sound similar to one of the other songs  I try to recall,btohqsg
Istg my seniors carried my section sia,btohqsg
oh yes  part of the melody a little similar,btohqsg
You played the simplified version or the actual piece,btohqsg
similar to the youtube version  probably we have less people,btohqsg
that time we borrowed people from Band because not enough Cello and Double Bass players,btohqsg
I only attended one time syf 😅,btohqsg
i lost it when his head hit the ceiling and the cabin light turned on lol,btohqsg
When homies take it too seriously,btohqsg
the other common CO song used is 刀,btohqsg
dunno. found it by searching for the song,btohqsg

Is it weird to have a twin brother of a different age/bday?,btohqsg
Unless it’s 12/31 11:59PM and 01/01 12AM,btohqsg
And somemore one guy one girl,btohqsg
Anybody still receiving tele job messages,btohqsg
Doesn’t matter what they say right?,btohqsg
"Literally asked the person ""how I know this not scam""",btohqsg
Anybody know how to check whether a company's website is legitimate?,btohqsg
HAHA  I mean their process is they'll expect you to WhatsApp them  then they'll add u into a grp chat with a bunch of strangers (some local most overseas) then send u the task and u do then they'll disappear forever,btohqsg
"no company uses Telegram PM to ""recruit"" staff",btohqsg
I got a job thru telegram tho but I pm them one,btohqsg
Ya. Its you pm them  not they pm u,btohqsg
and also when their description says nothing... Its a tell tale sign it's a scam,btohqsg
Some more no need resume or interview  seem sus enough,btohqsg
The person gave me the company's name,btohqsg
But the way they text is a bit off,btohqsg
"Like when the person mentioned "" we is from xx company""",btohqsg
I mean it's kind of obvious which are fake y once you start receiving like 5-10 of them a day,btohqsg
She told me to fuck off 🤣,btohqsg
Then she deleted and cleared chat,btohqsg
I just sent her a lag message,btohqsg
"or sometimes send them their ""company"" website",btohqsg
And go like... I contact supervisor now  I want more money job. Your job no good,btohqsg
Also if anybody is planning to work as waiter/waitresses after Os  please don't apply for the company named primarius,btohqsg
Lol I got those DMs as well,btohqsg
Had a bad experience  don't recommend cause ahem they expect you to work damn fast and carry lots of heavy ass plates,btohqsg
Not worth it for 9/1 10/1,btohqsg
I worked fnb few times and hated it LOL,btohqsg
During my experience  on the spot while working  there was an ongoing argument and shouting between the stupid senior waiter and a beginner at the back of the restaurant kitchen sooo yep  the person quitted on the spot too,btohqsg
There was ad hoc jobs(refill ice bucket serve complementary meals(bread busket) kinda burnt my fingers )   no clear instructions on what to do etc. Etc. During peak hours  it was just dead ass shitty. Its more of you adapt on the spot. Need to be  v vigilant,btohqsg
It's a legit company but nah just block em lol,btohqsg
I should have joined my friend and work in popular,btohqsg
But we kinda didn't contact after grad so I didn't know until I went to the shopping mall she was in,btohqsg
Yea but if cashier role can't go toilet during busy hours,btohqsg
Cashier the most stressful job istg,btohqsg

Also got shouted by senior waiter who's supposedly helping other ppl cover 15 duties  shouted at me for not clearing plates fast enough like bruh. (clearly vented his stress and anger at me) How am I supposed to know that he's helping others cover 15 duties  and  some more  fking unreasonable sia like I'm supposed to clear 7 tables with one man power(me oni 😢),btohqsg
oh that's fun as well :),btohqsg
What sort of cashier job u have,btohqsg
shd i even consider cashier jobs,btohqsg
I just chose the report spam and delete,btohqsg
Reply back in cursed language to assert dominance,btohqsg
lmao i just reply to them in Japanese,btohqsg
I only did it once on phone because I wasn't sure what happened  when a scam call came in and claimed they were from Singtel and my internet has problems,btohqsg
My first reply was my internet is from Starhub.,btohqsg
like kore wa scam desu ka?(is this a scam),btohqsg
"nice for some reason i keep getting calls from ""MOH""",btohqsg
After 2 more statements  the fake singtel person started scolding me  that's where I knew something was wrong lol,btohqsg
obvious its a scam cause they cannot speak in english,btohqsg
If you see a number starting with +65  it's a scam call,btohqsg
local numbers caller ID do not have +65,btohqsg
time to throw it away 🙈,btohqsg
one factor is where you working i worked cashier for fnb but i didnt like it cause every shift i get a diff colleague with diff ways of doing stuff say preparing hot drinks for customers i do it the way the other employee showed me how to do i kena scolded plus i felt very excluded cause they kept conversing with each other in malay and sometimes its bad mouthing about me lol malay is not my mother tongue but i can understand it because my father uses the language at home,btohqsg

One day I got like 3 different people having the same message to spam n block,btohqsg

I didn't apply any job through telegram but they pm me anyway,btohqsg
Idk is it the mass pming anyone from school telegram groups,btohqsg
Anyway I worked at f&b after O levels but not for long  I applied by recruitment agency so it became adhoc role which is not suitable coz I didn't work f&b before. Almost all the outlets I was posted to assume I know what to do.,btohqsg
Problem is every outlet has their own system so it's a very wrong assumption in the first place anyway,btohqsg
They'll ask u to send apple gift card later on whatsapp,btohqsg

I still guai guai work a few times until I found out,btohqsg
I found out my friends ghosted their execs lor,btohqsg
Then I did the same coz I was dreading work anyway,btohqsg
Abit assholery but the execs handle a few staff at once so it's not like cnanot get replacement,btohqsg
I saw the uselessness of certain branch managers,btohqsg
Tbh other than working in fnb after Os  what can we do anw,btohqsg
guys i'm laughing my ass out now man,btohqsg
Yea coz idk how they even get promoted,btohqsg
Dare to tell me got too many staff,btohqsg
Another one just watched 2 waiters arguing,btohqsg
When one of them rage quit take his stuff and left she never issue any disciplinary action,btohqsg
HAHAHA laughing my ass off BRUH,btohqsg
Worse is that guy was supposed to be my mentor,btohqsg
Was left hanging with no new mentor,btohqsg
2nd shift she also never assign me to other poeple,btohqsg
Omg send us what she/he replyyy,btohqsg
I really wanna know what's gonna happen hahahaha,btohqsg
