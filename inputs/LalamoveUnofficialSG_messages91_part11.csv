They also never tell you you can ask them to amend orders if the customer item is way more heavy and bulky but your car can still able to squeeze in,btohqsg
hahaha this one  really got no space. so i had to borrow the hotel next door space to park awhile. luckily the hotel was being used as QO  so no cars were going in and out,btohqsg
I think I saw this somewhere or maybe I read this for another delivery company ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I think my time  they might have amended the trainings. Feels like Ive seen these few things in the training but I could be wrong.,btohqsg
Idk how to stack orders coz Im not sure if I can do it on time or not,btohqsg
My advise donâ€™t stack better lol,btohqsg
I try a few times last week everytime I stack orders  and I finish it too fast after that you will end up in that area with either no job around your area  you jobs all very far away  once there is job around but no matter how fast you swipe you canâ€™t get it ðŸ˜†  even youâ€™re the only 1 queuing for that order also canâ€™t get  job come and disappear very fast,btohqsg
sometimes I feel like the commission is such a rip off.,btohqsg
Today I donâ€™t even stack any order not even 1 and I manage to get more mpv jobs,btohqsg
missed plenty of good orders before coz i was too late,btohqsg
ðŸ˜† happens to me all the time,btohqsg
Not ready is you late bro,btohqsg
but sometimes is coz I'll search map first see convenient for cars or not. haha,btohqsg
I collected last week data to know  itâ€™s just $20 per hour,btohqsg
my first order  I think I was scammed by the merchant... he said he forgot to added in 2 more locations and he said he will call Lala. I just nod and said ok. hais.,btohqsg
Guess how many hours for this,btohqsg
are you doing this full time? how do you manage to get so much in a day?,btohqsg
Next time just collect cash from him lo,btohqsg
idk the rates at that pt of time. my first order. still nervous and all,btohqsg
so sometimes  you dont really see how much you earn but rather  you just take whatever there is?Sorry. I just need some tips on how to increase the income.,btohqsg
See extra drop how much just charge accordingly lo,btohqsg
then if its a motorcycle order  but I use car. Can I charge him using car rate?,btohqsg
I take bike car mpv which ever comes first and must be near me,btohqsg
But I donâ€™t take muti order,btohqsg
wait. whats the diff btwn stack and multi order? stack is like those multiple drops is it?,btohqsg
Muti order see $$ shiok but waste a lot of time,btohqsg
Stack is 2 different order number,btohqsg
oh multi is the multiple drops,btohqsg
Muti only 1 order number 1 pick up only,btohqsg
I see. Thanks bro. Really appreciate all your help man.,btohqsg
I always thought multi order  more $ is shiok but this might change my mind. Maybe I'll try your way instead.,btohqsg
Anything close and convenient just eat  it waste too much time choosing orders your earnings will drop,btohqsg
First few days of my llm life I keep taking cars and mpv orders only end up earnings damn bad,btohqsg
Sometimes wait 30mins to 1 hour no car and mpv orderâ€¦,btohqsg
Depends if it convenient and near and donâ€™t waste too much time I take,btohqsg
so basically  dont be choosy ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
