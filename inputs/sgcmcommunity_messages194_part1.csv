Mercedes-AMG SL43 ReviewA searing hot 2.0-litre engine makes the SL43 an appealing option for those who lust after the compact and less-powerful SL models of old.➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
Can it block off a saab?,btohqsg
will the Jc girl survive if she sit in a Volvo not Kia?,btohqsg
Don’t see saab cars on roads often. How come ah,btohqsg
completely different from the previous models.. driven R107 up to R230  this current generation of SL43 feels unrefined and lazy. Slapping on 2 big screens and calling it a day is just sad… nothing compared to historical german over-engineering. And owners have complained about issues with the transmission  gearbox and electrical stuff… might have to call this German Unreliable Engineering,btohqsg
for that money  wld definitely choose stuttgart’s 911 over the SL43,btohqsg
No offense bro but this qn really needee?,btohqsg
The pricing on this car is absolutely atrocious for what you are getting. This thing is a tough sell even at 2/3 the list price,btohqsg
@seeker970he look down on Kia isit 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Most car crash test usually at 70kmph.. Going 120+ is.. usually untested grounds,btohqsg
Kia ok ma. Why look down :(,btohqsg
But tbh the revamp logo KN looks nicer,btohqsg
I see kia car crash test like ok  got intrude in from the crash  but airbag and seat belt will help to reduce the impacts,btohqsg
But if the driver that hit you really out for blood by going very fast then it doesnt matter..,btohqsg
Bro the dummy died on the spot,btohqsg
Just another typical Merc driver finding excuses for the irresponsible act,btohqsg
Speed up to tell the other driver to slow down.😂 new technique,btohqsg
Is not new technique is very common for driver to do that to prevent other from cutting in his lane  just very suey he met this saab driver. Instead of slowing down he rammed it through.  We can speculate what if the merc didn’t speed up etc but as a seasoned driver you damm know when someone pulling away and have no intention to slow down  your immediate and logical action is to slow down wait for safe opening.,btohqsg
Ok la the head never snap off got chance of survival 😁,btohqsg

It's lame  should just slow down instead of joining and coming another menace. He's just having an ego problem,btohqsg
Buy Cat A tune to Cat B 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Have you ever exited from expressway? Have you encountered people speed up to close gap from cue cutter ? Is a common move  what spurred the merc do is yes big ego when you have the whole lane for u and nothing infront. The question here is the judgement of the saab driver  common sense u see people pull away not giving way; u slow down and hit brake just like everytime u want to exit expressway cutting to the left  same technique here apply,btohqsg
i believe they think their car is faster coz got high hp,btohqsg
i encounter a few times  mainly BBA,btohqsg
BBA cut across expect people to give way,btohqsg
when their turn they just step on accelerator to show they are faster,btohqsg
they are lucky they are not in jb,btohqsg
they drive my old car smash them,btohqsg
i thinking buy old hilux/dimax with metal bar installed on the side,btohqsg
i c they dare to do it in jb,btohqsg
Because these car are very cheap  nowadays. They always think they are the king on the road,btohqsg
😅ego la  if u have high hp y don show off,btohqsg
i kana bang by a bmw,btohqsg
i already signal and want to cut to the left,btohqsg
from far (from his car video) he ram the accelerator to bang me,btohqsg
