There is no way the Opel Insignia will replace a stinger 3.3😂😂,btohqsg
stinger 2.0 is already a stretch  defo not 3.3,btohqsg

A 1.5 Turbo alternate to a 3.3 Twin turbo? HAHAHA nice try,btohqsg
"SGCM need to double check their definition of  ""High-performance""",btohqsg
heard u got the nicest stinger in sg 🫣,btohqsg
No way that there was a suggestion for an f10 520i and 528i as an alt to a gs350,btohqsg
The units on the market are ermm,btohqsg
As usual  poor journalist standard. Poor senseless comparisons,btohqsg
They might as well say GTR hard to find  replace is a Toyota Vios,btohqsg
Forget about 530i as there are no listings?,btohqsg
3 listings for 540is as well,btohqsg
1.2 vs 1.4 golf  which one will u pay for?,btohqsg
WT F WHERE U SPAWN THE 39 UNITS FROM,btohqsg
As soon as they posted the article. All decided to sell.,btohqsg
they sian pay 100k in premium kena compared to GS350,btohqsg
Im barely 30 and I do this,btohqsg
I'm 20 and I'm doing it alr,btohqsg
None of this car is enjoyable. Engine too small,btohqsg
For a small unit only car best to get Japanese,btohqsg
Disagree... the GTI and Golf R are 2 of the most fun hot hatches to drive,btohqsg
That’s rubbish. Did you read what cars are discussed in question? Those are small cc engined cars. They’re craps no matter what turbo you slap on it. GTi has bigger engine. 2 liter at least. Correct?,btohqsg
How can these be fun at all,btohqsg
I have to say  1.4 VW engines.Don’t  underestimate the cc number.You’ll be very surprised.,btohqsg
Bruh... you go watch the end of the video anot,btohqsg
Walao anyhow smack without watching the video,btohqsg
The fact is a small engined car will never equal to the driving pleasure or feel of a larger engined car.,btohqsg
Even if a turbo makes more powerful. It’s different feeling,btohqsg
You should see more videos about this because arriving at such conclusion.,btohqsg
We’ll take the Turbo. You can have the NA. I’ll take the turbocharged car imo.,btohqsg
A 1.2 turbo car will never be the same as a 2 liter car.,btohqsg
And pales in comparison in driving enjoyment,btohqsg
I was skeptical for our average cars to have a downsized engine with a turbocharged slapped in it  until when I tried and owned it  wah  times have changed indeed.,btohqsg
A proper gTi is 2 liter turbo,btohqsg
Sigh... don't wanna argue with someone who doesn't even see the end of the video and make baseless statements that vastly differ base on personal preference,btohqsg
Drive it. Don’t argue over video,btohqsg
1.2 turbo is made to attack the market where affordability sells,btohqsg
sua alr. u just happy with what u have can liaoo,btohqsg
Take the car over long distance you will know the diff,btohqsg
yeah man  sometimes they can fire rods out of their engine bay further than subies,btohqsg
driving PLEASURE wise  NA over turbo for large cc cars,btohqsg
but u tell me 1.0L turbo vs 1.2L NA  i will take the turbo,btohqsg
Got to be reasonably large engined for long distance driving. Otherwise stressed out,btohqsg
This topic confirm will have debate one hahahah,btohqsg
This one is similar class comparison.,btohqsg
