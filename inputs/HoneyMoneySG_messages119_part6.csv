Do you know online retail consider  8%?,btohqsg
Hi  i am going to use Wise for remittance  and they have option to add fund via Paynow QR. Is there a way for me to add fund via Credit Card utilising this Paynow QR?At first  i tried using grabpay to scan the paynow QR  but sadly unsuccessful.Thanks!üôè,btohqsg
Usually cut off is 10.30pm  after that will be counted as next business day.,btohqsg
HSBC seems is 10pm. I moved money into HSBC before from scb at early 10pm+. Counted as next day. ü•≤,btohqsg
Actually  she is also helping herself? Since you probably redeem for both of you?I got my Husband into this and he is very motivated to earn miles after we flew our first business class. Can‚Äôt go back to economy anymore  unless short flights üòÖ,btohqsg
Wow never see before. I only heard of same day or future date posting (because missed cutoff).Never heard money transfer on 1st being captured for 31st one day earlier  albeit it was stated valued 1st la.,btohqsg
What is the best credit card strategy right now  to pay for a $50k wedding banquet dinner? Willing to explore both one off payment/tranching payments too. Willing to explore both miles and cashback options,btohqsg
Hi! I was trying to set up giro for tax on UOB PIB but I could only select my uob one acct. If i wanna use uob prvi + card up  how do I make the giro arrangement with my new prvi credit card? Unable to see the giro option to credit card.,btohqsg
Is amaze card still worth it now? Or should i use trust card? If im not wrong  trust card will also convert foreign spending to local spend and save on the bank surcharge.,btohqsg
The first thing u need to find out is what is the Mcc of the credit card terminal where u will be paying at.,btohqsg
Oohhh Marriott hotels.Actually that‚Äôs not good news since u cannot make use of the much easier 5812 restaurant category.My suggestions are:$2k Uob lady travel category 6mpd$2k Uob vs PAYWAVE 4mpd$1.1k Uob ppv applepay 4mpdThis covers $5.1k per month. See if husband and wife each apply. That‚Äôs $10.2k per month pre payment per month.,btohqsg
You make giro arrangement with your bank account (as a backup). Then set up cardup income tax payment. Dont forget honeymoneysg promo code for card uphttps://t.me/HMSGHive/1791,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
For friend wedding banquet  assume at s'pore hotel  also for daily usage:UOB Visa Signature - min S$1K  max S$2K per statement month  contactless payment. Can use for FX too.UOB PPV - max $1110 per calendar month  must mobile contactless (use phone in store to tap).Both cards earn 4mpd. Spend in $5 blocks. UNI$ earned pools together. PPV cannot use at UOB$ merchants  eg. Dairy Farm group.,btohqsg
Ah understood now. So giro is with bank acct and cardup does the payment earlier via my uob prvi setup. Thank u!!,btohqsg
And recommended to set up cardup payment like a week or more before iras deduction (6th every month). Iras will have enough time to process and not deduct from ur bank giro.,btohqsg
Did u participate June-Jul promo n transfer in on 01 June? If yes  can you check your statement?,btohqsg
Noted. Will set up giro now + cardup when I receive my prvi card for Aug's payment.,btohqsg
Just checked.1st June transfers. All captured under 1st June date in HSBC EGA statement.,btohqsg
In June statement or May statement?,btohqsg
June statement.My HSBC statement is not 1st to 1st.Nevertheless it shows under 1st June date entries.,btohqsg
Hope bank will follow what is stated in TnC that is based on calendar month.,btohqsg
So what u worried?Worst case u got 1 day higher reference month adb?Shouldn‚Äôt total loss?,btohqsg
Worst case is my transaction will be treated as May which I did not participated/registered. So only earn 0.05% in June because it is not fresh fund in June?,btohqsg
I see. Maybe u should check with HSBC live chat for your peculiar case on why you can see 1st June transaction in a May statement?I actually don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs serious especially if it is date stamped 1st June transaction. Which statement u see the transaction should not matter. What date it is recognised is what‚Äôs important.,btohqsg
hi all! anyone know if atome instalment payment is considered online transaction for citi rewards?,btohqsg
I saw some dp saying it is not.,btohqsg
can i ask for nation of savers promo  is there a way to use my current pool of money as a fresh fund? what can i do?,btohqsg
Do you already have uob one account? If yes  what was ur june MaB?,btohqsg
yes i have it already. MAB on my UOB one is 5 digits,btohqsg
Then just top up to 150k.,btohqsg
I have set aside money for other bank acct,btohqsg
Was thinking how to utilise my current money in uob one to make it into fresh fund.,btohqsg
You need to understand how UOB define fresh fund. Usually ppl transfer all out in jun. Now it's too late to act,btohqsg
Fresh fund to HSBC EGA  fresh find to SCB eSaver  fresh fund to OCBC 360 account,btohqsg
On top of what others have suggested  remember to giro all credit cards bill to hsbc ega for an additional 1% cashback!,btohqsg
For fashion category  only online is counted. For retail  I don't recall. Better check their T&Cs. They have a very narrow criteria for retail  only selected brands iirc. Quite lousy.,btohqsg
On your caseFirst thing is Ega statement is not generated based on calendar month  it is not 1st to last day of the month.The date can be different for everyoneFor your scenario  I believe your statement happens to generate every month around 1st or 2nd  thus you feel your june transaction posted into May. But it is not  because EGA does not cut off the statement on last day of the month like all other banks.I think your funds posted on 1 June are very safe. Anyone please correct me if you have another opinion.,btohqsg
Hi  may I know how to check my account‚Äôs MAB? Is it stated in my account or have to self calculate? Sorry  am new to uob one account,btohqsg
Has anyone received a call from UOB recently claiming to have a savings product with better interest rate than UOB one account and the RM asked to meet at a UOB branch to explain more?,btohqsg
Based on last action.  Deposit date or form submission date. Whichever later,btohqsg
I went down yesterday to open a UOB one account and the staff was talking about a new savings plan (July oni) that they have to combine with the UOB one account. If you don't want to do the min spend of $500 can opt for the savings plan and there will be a min deduction of $500 per month (or was it $510  can't remember haha). The funds will be locked in for at least 10 years or 15 years(depending on what you choose).  The annual interest will be higher for the 15 years option. They mentioned that each outlet has different percentage as well?So if you choose 10 years  then they will deduct 500 per month  so 1 year like at least 6k. Then after 10 years with their annual interest rate will be a total of $68k (total of 8k interest for 10 years). This is just for the waterwaypoint branch UOB.,btohqsg
Am I right hsbc ega still need 5 transaction to qualify but they put new condition in July for funds to be deposited within 30 days so these flow out will have no interest not fair wor,btohqsg
Probably ask you get endowment plan,btohqsg
Recently I have got my 100k earmark came back from rising dragon promotion. I cannot just keep it in uob and should reset it for next promotion?,btohqsg
hi Chris  if btw CSPX and SPYL  would you have a preference which to go for? üòä,btohqsg
I see  thanks for sharing. I asked the RM to tell me more over the phone but he say cannot  to avoid scare of scams. But him not wanting to tell me more seemed more sus to me lol,btohqsg
It's a typical way of them setting appointment,btohqsg
Yeah does seem like it from the description above,btohqsg
68/60= 1.13. ie 13%. annualised will be 1.13%,btohqsg
