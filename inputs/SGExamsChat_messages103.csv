Eh excuse me  who said 7 HOURS OF UNINTERRUPTED REST MEANS 7 HOURS OF UNINTERRUPTED SLEEP,btohqsg
"Now we are officially part of the ""back in my day"" gang",btohqsg
Tbh that linkedin guy sounds self entitled,btohqsg
Screw u. Jobs are for locals,btohqsg
"Eh.1. No they have not contributed to the economy by studying here. The scholars(the rest we can discuss separately) are covered by gov scholarships. 羊毛出在羊身上。Their contribution starts when they serve their 6 year bond.2. The scholars chose to study here precisely because principals of top secondary schools/Unis in SG ask them to come here. It is not a singular wish  but a mutual yearning. At least a quarter of Singapore students going to HYPS are scholars  whose ability would probably beat the most of us out there. Having scholarships to bind them here in SG is mutually beneficial. If the gov chooses to bind them with incentives  cutting the incentives now defeats the purpose doesnt it?3. I somehow realize in my own experience that Singaporeans tend to work harder in face of competition. This is a service  not a detriment.4. The above points quite clearly depicts why gov has incentive to help them.5. Their gov dw help them what are you talking about? They are bonded to singapore and returning to their own country to get help is tantamount to breaking bond. SG gov brings them here  then throw them away cos ""their gov dw help"" (isnt true btw) is bad argument. If SG care so much about how much China wants to help then bring these scholars here for fuck.",btohqsg
I dunno about individual level nationalism but at the country level SG brings these people in for a reason  and now SG gov seem to cut them out? Meaning at a country level SG is contradicting itself and making previous efforts go to waste no?,btohqsg
Dont hate on me cos u come from a certain group marginalised by what i say. attack the argument  not the person please,btohqsg
Oh also honestly I personally know quite a number of scholars  maybe 3 dozens  some of whom went to HYPSM  and those who got second tier school (berkely etc). Those going to HYPSM probably will go  but those who get offers from second tier schools  and are rich enough to go  some of whom chose NUS for reasons other than cos it's free. Think about that.,btohqsg
Come one la even we as locals also want work in sg cos its a good place to work  so theres no point in saying that their decision is selfish.,btohqsg
Erm idt we have hated on you?,btohqsg
yeah got ppl on discord hate on me,btohqsg
cos i say a good portion of us can afford to clear uni debt in 2-3 years,btohqsg
Well the argument isn't about locals having priority  it's about just providing support for foreign students,btohqsg
then some of the ppl who arent in the portion of ppl i mentioned,btohqsg
hated on me cos they say i elitist,btohqsg
yeah the linkedin post never say foreigners should have priority,btohqsg
he just state that he would like to have some support,btohqsg
maybe to a lower level than that that SGP gets,btohqsg
dont really think hes saying something thats pure bs,btohqsg
come a perfect analogy is the situation in Ip Man 4. Got watch bo,btohqsg
the chinese kenna screwed by americans cos they arent local,btohqsg
Back when we were allowed still to watch movies,btohqsg
why the sargent fighting so good de,btohqsg
then the officers all laokui liao,btohqsg
I think the main point of the movie was racism though,btohqsg
Cos I realise the americans hate on the chinese  and the chinese hate on the americans in the movie,btohqsg
SGP also faced the same shit back in 60s,btohqsg
The movie never 'said' which side was right or wrong clearly unike in ipman 2,btohqsg
i dont know much abt history but thats my impression la,btohqsg
the sargent say something about US being the clear supremacy,btohqsg
now that i hear it i wanna laugh,btohqsg
Time for me to say something controversial,btohqsg
Tbh  I never understood the concept/fear of having foreigners come into the country and dilute culture/take jobs,btohqsg
I can see their points  but I view it more as a win/win,btohqsg
its easy to understand but hard to accept,btohqsg
I believe  if sg is anything like uk  that visa policies states something like,btohqsg
a company can hire a foreign guy only when the job cannot be fulfilled by a local one,btohqsg
Hmm I've never heard of that policy though,btohqsg
Sponsorship plays 2 main roles in a migrant’s application for permission tocome to  or remain in  the UK to work:• where appropriate  it provides evidence that the migrant will fill a genuinevacancy that cannot be filled with a suitably qualified or skilled settledworker,btohqsg
tier 2 is the kind that students who grad apply,btohqsg
tier 1 are those who have exceptional talent,btohqsg
dunno whether sg has something like that,btohqsg
Is this your hottest take ever,btohqsg
It comes from simple assumptions. Just assume got limited jobs  and that any immigrant is competition. If elimination of competition means they need to tell the MP (or PM) to do it  then they will,btohqsg
But if we want to eliminate competition,btohqsg
After we eliminate immigrants  who’s next?,btohqsg
Best to get rid of John Smith,btohqsg
Thus why we should keep foreign workers seen as a threat so as to unite citizens,btohqsg
I shall eliminate everyone who gets in my way,btohqsg
And become god of the new world!,btohqsg
did i join the argument too late,btohqsg
Ever heard of jobs bank? Do you know what's the process like?,btohqsg
BTW to get$1 800 to $3 600as a dev  your job better literally only be pushing a button or running a designated shell script and sleeping,btohqsg
But anyway  the idea is simple,btohqsg
Greedy entrepreneur needs to print money,btohqsg
He posts a job offering of shit pay,btohqsg
Tells the govt  wtf no SGean applied  soz bozz I nid these people,btohqsg
And then proceeds to hire someone if possible,btohqsg
MNCs generally have less trouble hiring SGeans  so they can be picky and you compete against other SGeans so it doesn't really matter if there's quotas and/or if you need to get SGeans first then Foreigners,btohqsg
MNCs can also easily write documentation to show that SGeans are not up to desired standard for high-enough-paying jobs,btohqsg
eh whats this entire page of text suppose to do,btohqsg
hahah if you can state ur point first and then do the peel i think my brain will have easier time understanding,btohqsg
america is the greatest and most powerful,btohqsg
emperor u are the john 69 is it,btohqsg
My 2 days of hardwork just shows nul nul nul,btohqsg
Now i cant make it work the way it used to,btohqsg
I got dropbox but who would save testing files on dropbox,btohqsg
Who is lying in bed now let me know? 😂,btohqsg
Even worse i use recovery tool it still shows corrupted,btohqsg
how much is the ipad pro 12.5 inch 2018,btohqsg
isit a good decision to buy it,btohqsg
I see a lot of my friends use it to write notes and stuff,btohqsg
It does look very good  but I'm more of a pen and paper person,btohqsg
planning to get one as well,btohqsg
Even better with one of those screens that make your stylus feel like a pencil,btohqsg
I'm not an organised person so I'd rather let my iPad organise it for me,btohqsg
but ipad is just too good,btohqsg
I feel that I'm slower if I write on a tablet than if I write on paper,btohqsg
for tablet there isnt rlly an andriod alternative right,btohqsg
i found this dood on carousell,btohqsg
selling 2018 12.9 inch for 600,btohqsg
if it's still in good working condition,btohqsg
but isnt 600 a bit too cheap,btohqsg
it might suggest that there's some problem with the tablet itself,btohqsg
does ipad cause eye strain with eye protection on?,btohqsg
how lomg after then have eye strain,btohqsg
there's apps that help w that tbh,btohqsg
it's the same as looking at the computer,btohqsg
I will make an attempt to check discord once per day,btohqsg
Hello reps  A Streetcar Named Desire is streaming online for another day or so  so do forward this to your classmates. Even though it's not a text you're studying  the themes and concerns of the play are related to Mind and Self  so it's worth watching if you have some time. Content warning though  some sexual violence and domestic abuse. Thanks!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJEpYaD3yTw,btohqsg
Yo if anyone wants to watch it go for it ^,btohqsg
No this cant be real u cant be serious,btohqsg
Oh shit... are u saying theres some intimate things in the movie?,btohqsg
eh ive been using ipad since poly,btohqsg
never have i had another higher ROI investment,btohqsg
if you do stem then ipad is nobrainer other than cs,btohqsg
if u do humans its still good to annotate ur notes,btohqsg
still have to type out essays tho,btohqsg
Was it a leap of faith for you when you started to self study finance,btohqsg
eh bruh why u suddenly change topic- -,btohqsg
the opportunity cost is 2 weeks,btohqsg
we are young can afford to experiment,btohqsg
experimenting with consulting also next year,btohqsg
a ton more zai ppl ahead of me,btohqsg
What is this shit posting content,btohqsg
is it the conduction convection radiation,btohqsg
if yes is it bad i dont rmb that it has laws,btohqsg
failing cant be a joke anymore,btohqsg
i mean it was never a joke,btohqsg
but i wish it could be a joke,btohqsg
i failed bio since sec 1,btohqsg
I failed physucks since sec 1,btohqsg
i only started failing physics this year,btohqsg
In JC failing is a joke  I belong to the group that questioned it,btohqsg
Yes and wow I got noticed,btohqsg
either a flex or youre js in denial,btohqsg
You need to come up with your own Q,btohqsg
It’s not an exam  it’s a research so yea,btohqsg
Why you so interested in China Studies recently lol,btohqsg
without del S all of us wouldnt even exist,btohqsg
Wow I didn’t take you for a humans kid,btohqsg
Why in Chinese when you claim to struggle in CL Os lmao,btohqsg
U want compete with prcs arh,btohqsg
u wanna do eng in uni?,btohqsg
Fmath workload lower than sci mah,btohqsg
but jc physcis is a joke,btohqsg
sibei easy compared to other subject,btohqsg
honestly is h2 physics or h2 econs more worth it,btohqsg
honestly if you can do h2 math you can do h2 fm,btohqsg
so h2 fm might be better,btohqsg
Ok im taking h1 if im gg jc,btohqsg
H1 econs only case study swag,btohqsg
In terms of preparation for uni econs  yes it is almost useless,btohqsg
do essays its gonna be hugely helpful in uni,btohqsg
50% of h2 math people get A anyway,btohqsg
sian i shouldve dropped this year,btohqsg
I strongly advise you against taking China Studies in Chinese if you’re struggling in O level CL because you need to remember  you’re not just learning it in Chinese  you need to know those technical terms in Chinese. Those technical terms are another level.,btohqsg
tbh no la h1 still learn more shit than olevel,btohqsg
I thought u need min b3 in hcl to take cll or csc,btohqsg
got ped xed and the types of ddss curves,btohqsg
Ya otherwise how u survive cll,btohqsg
i cant even b3 for exp chinese 😔😔,btohqsg
Who like to compete against prcs please take cll,btohqsg
Then you struggling? Question mark haha,btohqsg
i must be in imagination rn,btohqsg
CSC goes beyond speaking mandarin at home lol. Like what is diplomacy  cybersecurity  colonisation in CL?,btohqsg
if you're willing to up your chinese game,btohqsg
If u just like chinese  prob cll is better,btohqsg
No  you don’t go for CSC to up your CL game  you need to up your CL game before CSC. China Studies no matter the medium is already a very demanding subject  you don’t want medium to be another problem.,btohqsg
U want large to be a problem,btohqsg
had to google what diplomacy was in chinese,btohqsg
China Studies was fun for me  but I’m not sure about the perspective coming from a Geog background.,btohqsg
It was fun to see the battle of ideologies manifesting in the present,btohqsg
Fun in retrospect  hell in the process.,btohqsg
Bedok  what is the combi you’re imagining with CSC in it?,btohqsg
U rather take csc than phy arh,btohqsg
I believe phy dist rate is way higher than csc though,btohqsg
i tot csc alot of chines students take,btohqsg
u want compete with them meh,btohqsg
alot of the chinese friends i have after taking csc changed their views about taiwan,btohqsg
sg tends to give a more balanced view of what happened between them than the ideological/dogmatic way of teaching in china,btohqsg
the view that taiwan is china's and taiwanese are dumbfucks,btohqsg
i dunno enough to comment but enough to say that many of them changed their views,btohqsg
Ok because I tookHistory CSE Econs  while taking CSE I can’t help but notice that my History and Econs knowledge helped in understanding CSE. So from my POV CSE is reliant on knowledge of those subj. Im not sure if you’ll be disadvantaged without the other subj. As for CSC  the syllabus is broadly the same but there are some slight differences but idk the specifics.,btohqsg
eh is not about typing but about annotating pdf,btohqsg
My exp says otherwise  50% of the reason I chose CSE is because of tha expectation but you’ll be surprised how the research scared a significant number of them away.,btohqsg
eh u say cse i say csc,btohqsg
U applied to SP for PFP,btohqsg
so long no need code or do cad,btohqsg
unless you own the surface book,btohqsg
but i always bring my ipad to class,btohqsg
I chose CSE because I thought a lot PRC take CSC  but then it turns out my batch not enough to open CSC class  I know a few PRC friends in sch. I asked them why no take CSC  most say dw do research.,btohqsg
ok lah u have one school as sample size,btohqsg
eh i need cycle through snow and rain,btohqsg
if someone go kacao my notability library i literally will smack him,btohqsg
the paper will always be white bobian tho,btohqsg
ive friends who use microsoft one note,btohqsg
I’m not gonna sugar coat it  research by its very nature is hell  research on China is another level of hell  because sometimes China sources they require China phone number etc. etc. But your understanding of the world  not just China  changes after that. It’s fun to be able to understand things beyond what the media feeds you but that’s the reward of going through hell 🙃,btohqsg
i js rmb smth i heard abt and ive been thinking abt it for the past 5 mins its so stupid,btohqsg
are some parents too protective or smth lol,btohqsg
This is a very general question,btohqsg
Which makes it very easy to say yes to,btohqsg
but protective to the point that they would send anyone who confesses feelings for their child for disciplinary action?,btohqsg
i feel like the child is js stupid,btohqsg
but idk it may be the parents desired course of action,btohqsg
Sounds like you want to confess to someone but are finding reasons not to,btohqsg
no one likes me i dont even need to try,btohqsg
i dont rly want rs now anyway,btohqsg
As in Boy confess to Girl’s parents they like the Girl  the Girl’s parents send boy for discipline action?,btohqsg
so may not be parents idk,btohqsg
Why would the guy confess to girl’s parents??,btohqsg
the guy confessed to the girl,btohqsg
then she reported him bc he confessed,btohqsg
that girl dk how to appreciate sia,btohqsg
you know that happened when shes 13 right,btohqsg
china legit dont let bgr before uni de,btohqsg
at 16 i havent been confessed to before but wtv,btohqsg
no theyre classmates so he's 13,btohqsg
maybe if got guy want to marry her she also report ohno,btohqsg
DM probably had a good laugh in the HOD room after that report,btohqsg
Things happen because they are caused,btohqsg
It’s time to set up causal factors,btohqsg
i mean i dont rly talk to many guys and im detached from the idea of dating as of now so i dont pay too much attention to that but its a fact,btohqsg
eh but no joke my Sec 2 class had a couple i initially thought it was puppy love  but they still together after 7 years  prob gonna get married after finish Studies but lol marriage is just a ritual to them at this point. De facto married le.,btohqsg
But I dunno if they’re still together,btohqsg
i with my ex for 8 years,btohqsg
what bs is this length doesnt mean shit,btohqsg
wait till married then say married,btohqsg
I didn’t say de facto because of length,btohqsg
nothing guarantees marriage de just say married when married,btohqsg
is the guy in NS right now,btohqsg
If so he hasn't experienced the full NS package,btohqsg
Yep. HAHA I bet he won’t experience the full NS package  I have come a Long way from betting that they’ll end within a month lol.,btohqsg
Have yall seen the OGS video on the secondary school couples,btohqsg
one of the couples in the video actually uploaded a video of when the guy proposed,btohqsg
He asked 100 dance friends to do a flash mob,btohqsg
Same as a friend of mine,btohqsg
Why do u love me so much,btohqsg
U truely a student of ur prof,btohqsg
Old age technology old age codes all wanna burn processors only,btohqsg
Come n love me. I am a lovable kid.,btohqsg
Damn i must be a prekid then,btohqsg
Mfw i read jason as json,btohqsg
There is one who shallnt be named,btohqsg
But he goes by the user ofbedok viewian,btohqsg
Then be a good kid and fetch me a drink,btohqsg
You havnt seen the world yet thats why ure saying this,btohqsg
And by saying this u r planning to not see the world in future also,btohqsg
Do u know  if u dont have aircon and its hot u can snap ur neck. Death has a cold embrace,btohqsg
Do u want me to break ur aircon,btohqsg
Who u calling strawberry u fucking orange,btohqsg
Reminds me i need to start packing,btohqsg
I am sure ur laptop is still there,btohqsg
We werent allowed to leave anyth behind,btohqsg
No they collect back alr haha,btohqsg
Wah then book in have fun man,btohqsg
P R E C I S E L Y,btohqsg
I dont even know where to get 500 sheets of ziplock bags,btohqsg
My friend never bring ziplock bag during bookin after confinement,btohqsg
I carry my home with me,btohqsg
U gotta waterproof the whole thing,btohqsg
Just in case u do river crossing,btohqsg
Trap some air inside so there is buoyancy,btohqsg
Eh then iron board they also bring back arh,btohqsg
And the iron is in my kontrol,btohqsg
Please last time my bunk 10 ppl share 1 iron board,btohqsg
oh no i asked this qn before,btohqsg
All chip in buy iron in the end lend other bunks,btohqsg
how valuable/worthless is a science degree,btohqsg
Wad kind of army needs iron boards? Dig shell-scrape?,btohqsg
oh no... that is definitely true,btohqsg
unless i become a fake science student,btohqsg
Can eat or not this army,btohqsg
And a v fugly photo of u  botak,btohqsg
It's a privellege according to our minister josephine teo,btohqsg
U will know in few years time,btohqsg
Who is so underprivelleged she doesnt have one herself,btohqsg
She also tells u procreation dun need alot of space,btohqsg
See how deadfish u all are in bed ba,btohqsg
I think economy more like titanic now,btohqsg
4 weeks i never study physcs,btohqsg
Prize is only given to those who r worthy,btohqsg
did u ever learn anything? 0.0,btohqsg
No i was born with sufficient knowledge to last 18ish yrs,btohqsg
i knew they were poisioning my vaccines haiz,btohqsg
I wonder in the first place did that person even paid for their education or did sg govt sponsored em in the first place,btohqsg
Pay you $500 to delete that,btohqsg
Oi I scholarship every year no insult me k,btohqsg
If it is edusave  it is not a scholarship,btohqsg
Damn i tot they only give out a few of those and u are the recipient every year,btohqsg
It’s Edusave Scholarship. Definitely has the word Scholarship on it.,btohqsg
HALL OF FAME : JAY TAN biggest degen,btohqsg
Takes one to know one I suppose,btohqsg
That is actually lame  got it for 4 times during my secondary school time,btohqsg
I never said it was cool,btohqsg
But for a broke kid like me it helps,btohqsg
And I appreciate the help I get,btohqsg
Getting the most improved award is ezgame just do shit in one exam and go all in the next,btohqsg
True. That’s why it’s only $100,btohqsg
Aight gonna continue binge watching my shows,btohqsg
No I’m completely a JC student,btohqsg
Let us not degrade him  we shall call bedok a simp instead,btohqsg
Looks like you are at a loss of wordPerhaps you have nothing to rebut against our claim?,btohqsg
“psst the correct phrasing is loss for words”,btohqsg
I wanted bedok to correct it since he has nothing to go against our view,btohqsg
How does a retro gaming theme looks like,btohqsg
Is it worth it to invest in SIA,btohqsg
Serious you ask about stock advise in a student group,btohqsg
If sia price fall to $1 buy confirm win,btohqsg
I thought after virus ends is global recession lol,btohqsg
By right should be drop lower,btohqsg
Virus never ends  one sleeping another wakes,btohqsg
I want to sleep also like a virus,btohqsg

I saw this yesterday and I did not know smu has such incentives for students sia,btohqsg
Ik people who spent $50 for html css classes for a cs course insteaf of py c+,btohqsg
Then when i told them i kena scolded for mansplaining,btohqsg
ehhhh dh free delivery sia :/,btohqsg
Arent this free on youtube anyway,btohqsg
okay la 8 dollars not that bad tbh,btohqsg
Udemy cheaper lol  but tbh html + css + javascript easier to impress interviewer's,btohqsg
U learn outdated stuff which is free,btohqsg
Esp if not really even related to uni course,btohqsg
Pug/haml is html preprocessorSass/less is css preprocessor,btohqsg
I think related to uni admission like aba for NUS,btohqsg
No they alr in cs course overseas,btohqsg
In uni you learn mainly the theory which is not so easily found online,btohqsg
Html css where got theory HAHAH,btohqsg
I mean comp sci topics arh,btohqsg
At best u learn theory of organisation,btohqsg
Yalah but person spend money to learn html css,btohqsg
I think local uni never teach Web development unless it's smu,btohqsg
There used to be cs3226 web development. Removed liao,btohqsg
The online websites also dun teach u modern web development,btohqsg
Modern web development is very vast can use a lot of things,btohqsg
Now more and more ppl using flask module,btohqsg
Ohh but I think it's for foundational knowledge,btohqsg
Then after that maybe can progress to react or angular or vue,btohqsg
It doesnt offer anyth. Yes u need to know how to do basic arethamatic to do complex log integrstions,btohqsg
But the industry entry standard alr set above the integrations,btohqsg
For some reason the classroom coding bootcamp like to teach Ruby on rails,btohqsg
Now Py or R more popular,btohqsg
For big data  hadoop and spark too,btohqsg
Do you guys learn Web development + data science on your own,btohqsg
If by data science u just mean the coding is possible,btohqsg
If you want to learn about all the algo urself not so easy,btohqsg
@definitelydidntseeyah hahaha need 64 min to free dil,btohqsg
All the ML algorithms need strong math background to understand,btohqsg
Thats like one of the few pure maths topics along with mulvar calc,btohqsg
most modern algo always will dtart with some partial integration,btohqsg
Basics on the other hand is really retarded,btohqsg
Anyone w common sense can do/follow,btohqsg
Svm not so easy eh hahahaha,btohqsg
Which makes it such that its not really impt to learn or at least soend money on,btohqsg
Most lah unless basics require a build up on smth,btohqsg
Then its not really basics alr,btohqsg
But u learn all these in the end not all are needed also,btohqsg
Neural network basics is pretty easy to pick up though,btohqsg
To get a job u just need to know what kind of data u working with,btohqsg
Algo dependant on type od data,btohqsg
Just curious do you need to know machine learning in software engineering,btohqsg
Thats why i said u have to be tarded to understand input output concepts,btohqsg
Actually software engineering these days also need use ML,btohqsg
Not really depends on what u wan the soft to do,btohqsg
Obv if its a simple CMS u would need some kind of ML,btohqsg
Software engineering itself is tough enough 🤣,btohqsg
or at least a simple neural pathway of nested if else loops,btohqsg
Having some basic knowledge in ML will help,btohqsg
Basic of any ML or algo is to mimic real life lor. If else statements are just logics u use to guide decisions,btohqsg
U model them on a computer can mimic,btohqsg
U organise and restructure and link it with other things,btohqsg
Then u dwell deeper into syntax of language u wanna use,btohqsg
Then from there u see the limitations,btohqsg
If u cant get the logic u spend money on basic stuff also no use,btohqsg
How do you know all this,btohqsg
Neil u should join the coding group la,btohqsg
Does uni teach what you just said in their machine learning curriculum,btohqsg
I dont know. What i said is basics to get u started in the industry,btohqsg
I dont know what uni teaches,btohqsg
I just grad from jc haha,btohqsg
So it means very comprehensive ah,btohqsg
Its logic heavy not really industry oriented,btohqsg
At least you not in Accounting lol later you work 9 am to 3 am,btohqsg
But if u dk the math behind ML algo,btohqsg
U can nvr use it properly,btohqsg
It's the same creator of node js right,btohqsg
This one true but thats why ppl hire in teams,btohqsg
I think so ?¿ i not sure,btohqsg
My js is limited to vanilla and jquery,btohqsg
U create a simple CSS also need to preplan first. Draw and design. Structure the classes. Create a webframe then start coding,btohqsg
In industry u just split those works,btohqsg
Same for ML but yes if ur maths weak u can never implement it,btohqsg
Coz udu what the fk is the function doing,btohqsg
Thats why stack developers are valued more than front/backend,btohqsg
But most of the time u will be doing it wrongly,btohqsg
Using the wrong algo for wrong problem,btohqsg
U wont know how well ur model is performing also if ur math suck,btohqsg
Nothing of importance happened after this,btohqsg
U go study ur law la,btohqsg
I feel like i can fight a case alr,btohqsg
U can showoff what u learned,btohqsg
Unless you're the ultra boundary industry then yes.And also industry probably doesn't want to get too close to research boundary unless it's specifically what the firm is specialised in. So honestly a brewery company won't care so much and would run tf / skl if it works.Unless you go by the name of William Sealy Gosset  or are some modern equivalent.,btohqsg
It depends on how deep you want to be involved in the ML process.I don't think a typical SWE is expected to keep up with the latest ML stuff  but if you're specifically hired for ML reasons rather than SWE then I suppose you need to be updated.After all there's Google Research  Microsoft Research  FAIR  Ali Baba etc. etc. all with funded research labs and top-tier ML people. In those places you can't run away from knowing the stuff.But if you're some Cloud Engineer it's more important for you to know microservices and architecture. Maybe porting shit from A to B (typically a huge pain). Maintain stuff. Fix bugs. Increase useability  etc. etc. etc.  all of which aren't ML,btohqsg
Damn those position sound like they are for PhDs,btohqsg
Those doing cutting edge research of course,btohqsg
Imagine you are a guy then you must be a old dude after you finish lol,btohqsg
Do you mean the perceptron or CNN? All of the latest tech have some magical architecture I don't expect typical students to learn. You could learn to use them like a black box  but knowing how different a Transformer is from an LSTM is a whole new story  because I can just tell you I don't really know why the Transformer works,btohqsg
I meant the basics like the architecture feedforward propagation backpropagation activation function and gradient descent all these,btohqsg
'becoming' WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,btohqsg
The only phrase suitable to describe PHP is fk PHP,btohqsg
Even after learning all these  all the advanced well-performing architectures still reduce to 'black box',btohqsg
I heard php was popular during 2012 era,btohqsg
Uhh  if you not a PhD  then I'm afraid you need to self-learn some really stupid levels of math. It's 'easier' to get a PhD,btohqsg
In equivalent 2020 terms  2012 is as old as the Roman Empire,btohqsg
Anyway  are you an undergrad or A-lvl student? Regarding ML math  it's more of a tool more than anything,btohqsg
Let's put it this way: you learn formal mathematics to understand the structures you use,btohqsg
u want to switch to computing in uni?,btohqsg
Bro good luck  from what I've heard of RP requirements to enter NUS CS,btohqsg
Always got SIM UOL or SIM UoW CS,btohqsg
No  it's literally just the real numbers we use daily,btohqsg
That is if I can't enter SIT Software Engineering,btohqsg
Seems like you're somewhat openminded in your approach  but somehow really settled on CS,btohqsg
Yeah it would be a tricky position if I am only accepted for local uni accountancy but not cs,btohqsg
Anything from> I applied the latest state of the art algorithms to do sentiment analysis of news articlesto> I wrote a HTML version of Conway's Game of Life,btohqsg
Doing stuff IMO is a lot more meaningful  unless you're the really theoretical kind,btohqsg
Not yet but I think I want to start with Web development (html  css and javascript) then move to c++ - > data structure and algorithms - > undecided,btohqsg
You should start with data structures and algorithms first,btohqsg
Because I think I want to have something to show first then I can afford to learn that,btohqsg
yea 86.25 is the bare minimum,btohqsg
Not that bad lah. Isn't there a lot of competition from ft,btohqsg
It’s like saying 20 L1R5 can go RI,btohqsg
Ft actually less compared to the past,btohqsg
I thought people would say Indian dominated,btohqsg
Hmm you go business management bah,btohqsg
Biz or acct more girls arh,btohqsg
Lol I'm already in double degree programme 😂,btohqsg
I heard that you can see a lot of chiobu at the big 4 audit but then need to work until 3 am,btohqsg
