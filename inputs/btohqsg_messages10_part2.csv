71 votes yet none chosen reservoir  the scenery would be good,btohqsg
Wow but the price for Kovan donâ€™t seem very non mature ðŸ˜… 4room going for 400+-500k hmm,btohqsg
Bedok reservoir and Tampines West mrt not the same thing?,btohqsg
I think the vote shows that keen applicants in tampines understood me lol,btohqsg
have to be fair since I separated kovan and hougang too,btohqsg
The tamp one side by side,btohqsg
Most people who apply for Tamp will be ok with either,btohqsg
The hougang one is different because people will give up when the kovan one is full,btohqsg
"""The ballot results will be made known to you by Early September 2021.Â """,btohqsg
Yea but usually BTO priced lower mahðŸ˜‚ I thought at most starting price 350k but wow 400-500k bueypai,btohqsg
Ignore the mature and non mature label  the price is not based on that,btohqsg

700m walk to mrt from reservoir side,btohqsg

okie! thank you! juz afraid the previous queued one wld be affected,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone have any idea how the mcps scheme will work in this way if I apply for kovan 4rm? Since the application lumps the 4rm for 2 different hougang project together. And for the hougang project I am beyond the 4km,btohqsg
Hi guys  Iâ€™m in the queue for my SBF but I doubt I will get the house since my queue is really really far. Can I still apply the Aug BTO? Or do I need to cancel my SBF first?,btohqsg
i think they count as nearest block in the project,btohqsg
they will just take the nearest block to your house,btohqsg
not sure you need to cancel but yeah you can go ahead with this BTO,btohqsg
as long as u havent selected a flat u can apply,btohqsg
Doesn't matter. Just need to be near any plot for MCPS. You will be able to select either,btohqsg
actually it's not a long wait for those projects completing in 2026,btohqsg
but might have more delays also,btohqsg
dunno if is factored in alr,btohqsg
wa boon keng flying under the radar,btohqsg
best plot for boon keng is already occupied by st George towers,btohqsg
my colleague is so proud of staying there since it is so convenient to him,btohqsg
anyway interestingly  hougang is the first to be completed in 2025   37 monthsof wait,btohqsg
i guess another pro of going there,btohqsg
hougang PCD by 1q2025 while kovan PCD by 3q2026  1.5year later,btohqsg
First timer here! If I submit an application now  what's the timeline for me in getting my ballot number?,btohqsg
Will be 3 weeks from closing date,btohqsg
Does not matter when u apply as long as u do it by the closing date,btohqsg
So is see lor.. some ppl like to just apply then dunnid think about it le,btohqsg
Some ppl die die want 1 particular area,btohqsg
Then some will wait and see application rates to see which has the highest chance,btohqsg
Can i ask if this is accurate? Can we use the Enhanced CPF Grant for downpayment?,btohqsg
Yes. Stamp duty all can used by grant.,btohqsg
2pm updated  Kovan 2x in half a day,btohqsg
If I apply under PHPS   is it also under public scheme?,btohqsg
Hi may I know hle when do I need to apply,btohqsg
Cos my bto starting to call out number already,btohqsg
Is ur no very close or very far,btohqsg
So when will I need to apply hle?,btohqsg
Because when I applied I did select PHPS  but at the end of application it stated public scheme,btohqsg
The Parenthood Priority Scheme (PPS) under HDB gives priority allocation for new HDB flats to first-timer married couples expecting a child  or who have a citizen child aged 18 years and below  by setting aside a proportion of flats to better meet the housing needs of this group.,btohqsg
HLE is valid for 6 months i think,btohqsg
