ya but i still feel i had a fairly decent journey in MI for now,btohqsg
Not many people i know had decent experience in MI  handful only actually,btohqsg
In fact anytime i hear of an MI student that makes it to ntu im very pleasantly surprised,btohqsg
if my sibling is currently a student in ntu  is there a higher chance i might get into ntu?,btohqsg
If thats the case  my brother was an alumni of spms ntu i shouldnt have needed an interview to get in 😭😭,btohqsg
unfortunately  idts  it’s still dependent on your own capabilities,btohqsg

Is that imported or one of those hainan durians,btohqsg
If it’s not from Malaysia at least it looks ripe,btohqsg
What country is it from actually,btohqsg
Damn it legit looks not bad leh. How’s the taste,btohqsg
At least it’s not those Thai durians that are cut from the tree then they look like potato,btohqsg
Pretty good  it's like the bitter version of maoshanwang,btohqsg
Only the piece at the bottom right looks a bit unripe the rest look good,btohqsg
Maybe with more time the quality of durians would improve,btohqsg
After all the hainan durians are relatively new,btohqsg
Wah but cheap sia  5kg only 40 sgd,btohqsg
Yeah  cheap for the Chinese consumer considering that importing Malaysia/thai durians would probably cost more for the average varieties. If the supply from Hainan continues to increase the prices might also fall,btohqsg
Quite a few varieties of Malaysia durians can be cheaper if bought locally or in Singapore but to get them to China they’d have to be air flown so would become much more expensive,btohqsg
