Anyways  everyone doesn't even know your raw score and it doesn't matter. Only the grade matters,btohqsg
Hi!  H2 math no ECF right?,btohqsg
There isn't a bell curve for A levels....,btohqsg
U see  everybody say different things,btohqsg
I lose 30m got B  I lose 45m got A,btohqsg
What people say here cannot be trusted,btohqsg
You can't say for sure how many marks you lost,btohqsg
Unless you have the marked script,btohqsg
The only truth is that there’s no certainty,btohqsg
I can say for sure how many final ans i didnt get,btohqsg
It is based on individual approximation and judgement,btohqsg
But that doesn't show the amount of marks lost. It is still pure guessing,btohqsg
Their own feel of the cohort standard,btohqsg
I guess experience comes from marking other ppl's work,btohqsg
My estimation for my uni math test turned out to be true also,btohqsg
But diff cohort different standard too right?,btohqsg
But Cambridge doesn't reveal their mark schemes  apart from the specimen paper. How would you know what is the mark scheme for that paper. Hard to say,btohqsg
Due to cohort size and spread of standard,btohqsg
Ya la but doesnt change much,btohqsg
Maths is like the easiest subject to estimate tbh,btohqsg
Every cohort feels their paper are the hardest,btohqsg
No. I felt mine was easy,btohqsg
Lol no. My cohort was easiest cos first batch of new syllabus,btohqsg
When the 2020 h2 math paper is easier than ur uni math mid terms,btohqsg
My PW teacher was the first batch of PW,btohqsg
Den she say almost everyone distinction or smt,btohqsg
Of course uni is harder... jc is a prereq,btohqsg
You want a level paper to be harder than ur uni paper arh,btohqsg
It is possible that a meteor will crash into your exam hall and give you 100 marks,btohqsg
My PW teacher didn't even do PW in JC,btohqsg
I meant that its possible that the cohort so good that such an event could happen but again very unlikely,btohqsg
Den how come the A need 80,btohqsg
Den bell curve means what  only a fix amount of people can get A?,btohqsg
Den moderation they also change the marks to get A?,btohqsg
I heard that PW is useless,btohqsg
It isn't that helpful for your future career  but it is helpful for you to get into university,btohqsg
I guess it teaches you how to work in a group that you may not like  and if group members don't do much.It also teaches you to some extent how to reference  trains your writing skills to some extent,btohqsg
The latter is needed in Uni,btohqsg
Ironically no. The former is more impt,btohqsg
For mathematics not really. maybe the final dissertation only,btohqsg
Anyhow write also can score ok,btohqsg
I think GP’s more that enough for the latter,btohqsg
The former... is the reason why a lot of people hate PW,btohqsg
I was happy that fewer people 'interfered' with my work. That's how I see it.,btohqsg
U cant run away from that in poly and uni if u know,btohqsg
Poly and uni have way more projects usually,btohqsg
Right now i alr have 2 projects,btohqsg
1 project in jc is nothing,btohqsg
The writing style in GP and PW is different,btohqsg
It’s literally what happens in real life,btohqsg
