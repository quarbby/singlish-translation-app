I not sure about that i havnt seen updated genebank hahaha,btohqsg
I saw a study like 1 to 2 months back. Said 8 strains but all silent.,btohqsg
By right this RNA virus has high fidelity copying but I guess not as good as DNA. Many mutations gonna be loss of function,btohqsg
It wouldnt be called a strain then,btohqsg
Yes that was like 2 mths back,btohqsg
No im saying.. if its a silent mutation.. it doesnr classify as a new strain cause there isnt any structural difference,btohqsg
Hahahaha cause u said 8 strains thats y,btohqsg
I didnt do bio for A lvls and O lvls. Quite difficult to catch up initially üòî,btohqsg
Oh ? It isnt a prerequisite for med ?,btohqsg
I didnt know that....i knew i shouldve just taken physics all along what a scam,btohqsg
Those @sg groups are still mass adding members from here huh,btohqsg
Iirc some UK schs require bio.,btohqsg
Ntu one requires u to take BMat,btohqsg
No need much prior knowledge right,btohqsg
I'm surprised how much pple learn at O and A lvls,btohqsg
It is my first time learning reflex loops  parts of the ear  gi tract etc. Like O lvl has quite a bit of physiology,btohqsg
I dont remember ever learning that in olvls,btohqsg
Mmm homeostasis shd have ba... reflex loops,btohqsg
At least for combined there wasnt much shit,btohqsg
Gi tract... like gall bladder  liver  cmk(forgot)   bile   gastrin  bla bla zz,btohqsg
Anatomy and physiology makes me fall asleep,btohqsg
Lol go listen YouTube videos about kidney nephrons . Guarantee fall asleep... brain blood vessels too tough . Get headache,btohqsg
I joined this group recently. I like the medical videos uploaded. Shd be useful for bio/medical students. Seems pretty legit leh,btohqsg
There's nothing wrong with the English? Lol.,btohqsg
Oh Haha which word was repeated? I am anal too üòÇüòÇüëç,btohqsg
I din see any repetitions hahah,btohqsg
Omg lol OCD... ya true ü§£,btohqsg
Where are u studying social science hahaha,btohqsg
I hate essays  but I hate med more,btohqsg
As in I love it la. But it's worse than essays,btohqsg
Hahhahaa I thought psych a lot of math,btohqsg
So first year  got a lot of essays?,btohqsg
I rather do essays hahaha easy to score,btohqsg
I almost wanted to do some science stuff but I heard lots of math so I went medicine on advice of my friends hahaha,btohqsg
They told me very little math. At most A level stats,btohqsg
Wonder how some ppl love math,btohqsg
Yeah its trueeeee hahaha at most some  very basic calculations,btohqsg
Hahhaa like I dont mind logarithms and linear law and some algebra but dont give me those sick uni stuff that I see on my friends insta,btohqsg
It's literally 24/7 studying even when u grad  but noooo dont give me math hahaha,btohqsg
I did some social sci electives. Loved it üòù,btohqsg
U mean like Korean and jap profs hahahhahah,btohqsg
Hahahaa issit? Okay la some can be quite good and meticulous,btohqsg
Yahahaha yeah ikr always see them working,btohqsg
Like 8 PM still in office,btohqsg
I heard ntu bio not as good.. not sure,btohqsg
But cant be that bad hahaha,btohqsg
Why would you even take bio electives though  Gpa sure drop,btohqsg
Its harder than social sci I think haha,btohqsg
Omg I heard so from my ntu friend,btohqsg
Hahaha jap and westerners are at the forefront of research la,btohqsg
