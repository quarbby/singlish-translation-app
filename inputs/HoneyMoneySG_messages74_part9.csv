hi anyone shopped atishopchangi.combefore ?what is the verified mcc code ?,btohqsg
How does 7.8%/annualwork for uob one saving?Corrrct me if im wrong  shouldn't i get $214/month?,btohqsg
First 30k - 3.85%Next30k - 3.95%,btohqsg
Oh..so it is like this?First 30k - 3.85%2nd 30k - 3.85% + 3.95%,btohqsg
(3.85%/365*31*30 000) + (3.95%/365*31*3113.78) in your case,btohqsg
I believe UOB advertises it as up to 7.8%. You will get 7.8% on the 25k after 75k. So it means even if you deposit 100k  your EIR is 5% (which is already fairly high),btohqsg
Ah totally got it.5% is still pretty good. Not gonna lie üòÇSo ideally  if i have 100k cash  just dump it in uob for maximum interest right,btohqsg
Any more than 100k is not worth it.,btohqsg
For the $500 min spend  can we use the digital card first? Or have to wait to activate the physical card?,btohqsg
Hi experts! If im looking to make a 2.5k euros purchase on a luxury brand's website (foreign domain)  is citi SMRT card the best card to use? Would be NTB too. Grateful for any input  thank you!,btohqsg
Smrt good for cashback  depend if u are cashback priority or miles priority,btohqsg
Is amaze + DCS Ultimate the best combi for overseas spending with no min. spend?,btohqsg
Why dcs ultimate? I think that one give you 2%  then amaze take 2%  then no benefit right haha,btohqsg
wow new to citibank üò≤ if you're looking on the miles side  can consider either uob lady solitaire (6mpd cap at 3k) or uob kf (3mpd). Can pair with amaze  do check mcc whitelist,btohqsg
UOB KF 3mpd for selected mccs and need to be online (can use Amaze)Do check MCC with Heymax first,btohqsg
Whats the best method to fund ibkr with usd? Fund with sgd then convert usd in the platform or fund usd directly from bank muti currency acc?,btohqsg
If i already have citi reward which change to krisflyer mile then this UOB KF also can add in to my krisflyer mile?,btohqsg
Any idea if UOB ladies solitare can earn 6mpd on all Agoda/booking.com/airbnbtxns?,btohqsg
Sure  I believe every card in Singapore can transfer to krisflyeredit: uob kf would go direct to kf,btohqsg
Not really sure what you mean but- UOB KF and CRMC both supports point accumulation with Instarem Amaze- Points in UOB KF adds your miles directly to your krisflyer programme- Citirewards Thank you points require yourself to transfer points to your frequent flyer programme (e.g. KrisFlyer),btohqsg
so the krisflyer point can stack on each other right,btohqsg
just wanna check how long must i hold a SC card before i can cancel to prevent claw back of rewards? Try to read the T&C but they didnt state (or maybe i couldnt see),btohqsg
Sure if your category is travel,btohqsg
If can't meet minimum spend of other cards (for higher cash rebates)  I suppose amaze + dcs ultimate is the best?,btohqsg
Yup one of it is travel,btohqsg
Don't have this card but don't think it works out  amaze 2% is also not fixed and sometimes could be higher or lower. So if you have no better cards  I would use amaze directly or revolut/youtrip etc,btohqsg
Joseph explained it quite well  not quite sure what you mean by stacking in this case,btohqsg
If want to use a credit card instead? For general spending with no. min spend,btohqsg
Frequent Flyer Program (AirAsia miles la... Krisflyer points la..) is one thing  CC points is another  just make sure the cards and your FFP's name matches and there shouldn't be an issue,btohqsg
Co-brand cards go directly straight to FFPPoints card (like CRMC) u need to manually convert to FFP (which may incur a transfer fee)  hopefully that clarifies,btohqsg
what cards u have and what r u spending on?,btohqsg
Same as Syfe and StashAway guaranteed return  does endowus have similar product as well?,btohqsg
Hi Guys. I will buy $1 000 SGD ticket with Singapore Airlines soon and I'm exploring suitable UOB credit card options.I'm considering the UOB Lady's  UOB KrisFlyer  and UOB PRVI Miles credit cards. I would like to seek you guy's suggestion which one might offer better welcome gifts and miles accrual for this scenario?,btohqsg
Just general spending.... no specific kind,btohqsg
I would say go withUOB Krisflyerhttps://hmsg.link/uobkrisflyersince it is alreaady SQ spending,btohqsg
According to T&Csv. Make a minimum spend of:Credit cards Minimum spend No later thanSimply Cash Credit Card $500 31 December 2023Smart Credit CardRewards+ Credit Card$250 31 December 2023Journey Credit Card $0 NA(on either the physical ordigital versionof the Credit Card) as defined by‚ÄúQualifying Spend‚Äù within a 30-day period from the account opening date and in anyevent no later than the dates indicated in the table above,btohqsg
Yes  SGD in and convert to USD,btohqsg
if i am cashback priority  are there any other cards with good/comparable cashback rates that can pair with amaze to reduce the fcy rate? or citi SMRT would be the best given its 5% cashback based on annual spending limit. thank you!!,btohqsg
oki thank you! much appreciates :)),btohqsg
hi bosses here  do anyone know for Singsaver CIMB Credit cards signup giftif we buy electronics product in Challenger and pay with Kris+is it consider as Qualifying Spend ?because in T&C didnt not specify exclude Kris+ only AMAZE is excluded,btohqsg
I am new to MooMoo. What does these 2 coupon means?,btohqsg
