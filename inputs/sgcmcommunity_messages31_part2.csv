The thing about japanese is  they really respect each other. Even cleaners take pride in their job and were respected like any other professions.Being in Japan really feels that you are not on the same planet. 🤣,btohqsg
I have bad experience during Honey Moon at Hokkaido..The airport bus service to Hakodate.They treat every Chinese   thinking from China. Not allowed to put luggage in to the baggage storage of the bus.Asked to drag up the bus but all Japanese can put their luggage at the storage trunck.Ask you to point your flag at New Chitose Airport. Can't understand basic English. Got unhappy after asking 2nd time to confirm the bus route to Volcano 🌋 attraction.Their politeness are all ACT base on their job.Not genuine friendly 😂I feel that Thai's  Indonesian  are genuine friendly.,btohqsg
Sorry to hear that. Maybe I had advantage since I can speak some japanese. (And some say I look and blend like them),btohqsg
But there are some caveat about japanese. They are so polite that you can't really tell if they are REALLY being polite  or just being professional 😅,btohqsg
They are Xenophobic but not as vocal as Singaporeans 😂👍,btohqsg
I was treated so nicely there,btohqsg
Yes bro u don look like chinaman,btohqsg
Ya must be able to speak fluent Japanese. To remove the xenophobic barrier.I see alot of China folk living in Japan. They speaks fluent Japanese.Blending in very well.Run business  hiring Japanese worker.Japanese wife.,btohqsg
They want to kill chinamen i think,btohqsg
Blessed to be malairen i guess,btohqsg

Well  China's tourist has cause many unpleasant experience in Japan.China is very big. Many different state. people behaving differently.,btohqsg
I can’t disagree on the first part,btohqsg
18 century to 19 belongs to Japan.👍,btohqsg
This. Usually we refer to northern Chinese.,btohqsg
I believe the mainland Chinese are better educated now. Not as crazy rowdy as last time.,btohqsg
big population size  so black sheep also more... just like people stereotyping bmw drivers,btohqsg
I may have spoken too soon. The recent viral video about man bulling ladies  Japanese hated those barbarians,btohqsg
Depend on state.Shanghai same as Singaporeans.Recently the northern China of 唐山。9 men best up two women at midnight Hot Pot restaurant.Now police deploy SWAT patrolling. HotPot restaurant.,btohqsg
Chinamen finally flex their muscles. Next time china women will be more submissive,btohqsg

Aye yo chill t’was a joke,btohqsg
He is lane splitting and travelling too fast in that pace of traffic.,btohqsg
Chill  he was joking. HahahahaCos I ended his flowery dreams of kawaii japanese girls last night. 🥲,btohqsg
I also Lane split.Traffic Police also lane split.Have to be very defensive riding. Look into the rear view window. See where the driver looking. Chit chatting?  Kept turning head and Looking left  look at side mirror.That is why rear window can only be 70% tinted and unblock like Van.Look at the front wheel. A slight turn on the steering wheel is obvious on the wheel.So can predict the movement of the driver.Ah Ga Ah Ga， can know the driver is impatient and the wanna lane change out ,btohqsg
Many lane split  what mainly caused the over reaction is that he is travelling too fast while lane splitting.,btohqsg
Like u said  that isn't defensive riding.,btohqsg
Given a benefit of doubt  Mazda driver did signal his intend to lane change.,btohqsg
You guys really funny last night,btohqsg
