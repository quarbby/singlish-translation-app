#delmonteSome viewpoints on del monteHighly leveraged. Everyone knows this  no secret about it. I don‚Äôt like it  I do hope 1b of debt disappear. However we can only work with what is available. There are concerns of their debtLegit concerns of courseHowever debts are always bad? There are only bad acquisitions no bad debts. Why so?Did anyone complain when a reit acquires assets that are earnings accretive?No. Because the returns / rental more than covers interest expense.Likewise for del monte. For sure at that point of time when they acquire US operations they took on loads of debt and almost crushed beneath. Share price went to 70 to 10 cent approx. refer to chart for past 3-4 yearsClearly they are a beneficiary of COVID. People stock up food stays at home and brand name boosted  market share surge. Their debt is reduced yearly and restructured to the point they can pay out a 10+% yield dividend last year. 1.5 cent usd when share price is 16 cent region.This year performance SIGNIFICANTLY outperform last year by the way. Expect to report in late July. Any increase in dividends? Sure hope soNext is catalyst. They sold 12% of Philippines operation DMPI at 120m usd hence the entity is valued at 1b usd  880m usd on del monte books. Market cap of DM is 540m SGD now.When DMPI get listed  the stake within DMPL is publicly traded and valued with ease. Spread between value discrepancy will close up sooner or later.Next is their US operations. Just the Philippines stake alone makes the company look cheap. Paying cents to dollar for the upcoming phil listing and the US part comes for free. A costly acquisition years ago now look like a decent buy or a bargain. The bonds at 11.875% coupon look likely to be redeemed earlier with their Strong cash flow and get further interest savingsLastly is growth. There have been numerous indication of increasing market share in markets such as China and India. The party that bought their 12% stake are helping in their expansion into ChinaWith incidents like Taiwanese pineapples boycott in China (and the black core ones in SG) DMPL is well positioned to capitalize and increase market dominance.All in all  the debts for now are well controlled with their cash flow  there is hidden value (no secret but clearly the market is discounting it) from the DMPI listing that comes with a free US operationsAnd increasing market share in lowly penetrated markets  plenty of room for growth.A good mix of value and growth in one. Something that couldn‚Äôt have happenWithout debtIf everything is so perfect  good cash flow good dividend good asset low debt and good revenue and profit growthWhere got such price!!!!Market can be inefficientBut unlikely to be utterly retarded. Value hunters are everywhere. Could be scooped before you start smelling it,btohqsg
