Oh wow letâ€™s see if chatgpt predictions are any good,btohqsg
Wow~ Similar to waiting for PSLE and GCE results,btohqsg
They're all looking at the flip opportunity. My relatives all wanted BB too  because near ACS etc,btohqsg
Maybe not ACS but i remember them saying it's near a good school,btohqsg
By end of dec. Man its nerve wrecking waiting for it,btohqsg
I rmb the previous launches  some people experienced missing profile  shortly later  result is released. Not sure if it still applies for this launch,btohqsg
Yes but I meant  the moment got missing profile  usually a few days later results is released,btohqsg
But I agree using missing profile to determine if you got ballot number is unreliable,btohqsg
I think maybe system loading or something so got missing profile ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
This week is week 6 alr haha,btohqsg
I am hoping it will be next week,btohqsg
Let's see if anyone spotted about missing profile,btohqsg

Roughly every launch.. result will release within 7-8 weeks,btohqsg
Usually HDB will have system maintenance before the results are out haha,btohqsg

From an applicant who wrote in to HDB regarding results release,btohqsg

Hello! Anyone here applying for the next Feb 2025 BTO?We are a bit confused here cos our HFE expires in Janâ€™25.The deadline to submit documents for Febâ€™25 is 15 Decâ€™24. In this case  do we need to cancel/ reapply a HFE letter  while we wait for the Oct BTO results? ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Yes pls apply for a new HFE.  While waiting for it  ur current HFE is still valid,btohqsg
why is it that for this round the deadline to submit is 15 december instead of 15 jan,btohqsg
Xmas and cny  maybe understaff coz alot are on leave so need more time to clear the documents,btohqsg
Hope they won't delay the appointment for selection,btohqsg
Have anyone in Canberra vista TOP ?,btohqsg
Some blks already got pple move in.,btohqsg
"Hi  when the result is out  we click this ""VIEW APPLICATION DETAIL"" then can see the queue number?",btohqsg
Hi is there any west brickville group...ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
Even before the Oct results come out? If apply now  would it affect the current application?,btohqsg
It will not affect. Ur current HFE is still valid,btohqsg
Hello and good afternoon Is there any Taman Jurong Skyline group chat?,btohqsg
Q result should be out anytime this 2 weeks. As after that is Christmas,btohqsg
Yes I think so also. Hopefully next week. Before Xmas,btohqsg
I saw HDB got maintainence on 15 Dec,btohqsg
What you mean so late? Should be by this 2 weeks,btohqsg
Yes. Highly unlikely to be this week too,btohqsg
15 Dec is Sunday maybe not affected,btohqsg
Your earlier msg mention as after xmas,btohqsg
I mean by this 2 weeks. As after that is Christmas,btohqsg
He meant  result will be out by this 2 weeks. Else is Christmas afterwards already haha - so prolly unlikely to have result release then as everyone on leave or break (my opinion),btohqsg
And also usually I wait 6 weeks,btohqsg
This time seems rlly long and draggy....,btohqsg
Ya standard is abt 2 months after application end,btohqsg
Haha ya... Just that usually they release within 6 weeks - 7 weeks,btohqsg
I'm guessing alot staff on leave,btohqsg
I also 3rd try... applied THC  HV and this time Marsiling. How about you guys?,btohqsg
Lol please. Ai known to make things up even if untrue,btohqsg
