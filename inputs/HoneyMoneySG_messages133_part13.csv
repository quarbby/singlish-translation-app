Hi gurus  asking a noob question please. I am considering shifting my ocbc funds to hsbc ega. If I were to open the ega account today and shift my funds over  I assume that my Sep bonus for my ocbc 360 account should still come in later? Please correct me if I am wrong. Thank you.,btohqsg
Yes. Provided u dont close it,btohqsg

Hi  still HSBC EGA question   for the bonus interest promotion only applicable for the incremental average balance. Does it mean if now I open the account and deposit 50k (1 Oct)  so the bonus interest only for the month of October. Then if on 1st November I deposit 10k.The bonus for November is only for the 10k (incremental) while the previous 50k will not be given any bonus interest ?,btohqsg

Hi Guru  just checking can tap thru heymax to foodpanda to earn from both side?,btohqsg
Morning everyone  saw the video on uob one vs ocbs 360 for highest interest rate. I have some questions  hope you'll can help me clarify it.1) The ocbc sending bouns interest. Must it be credit card or can I use the debit card to send the $500?2) Min incremental saving is it yearly or monthly ? And if I fail the $500 saving how much interest will I lose ?The video was uploaded 2 mths ago. Currently which bank gives the best saving interest if i meet the salary credit of $2k  Min spend of $500  incremental saving and a fund of 100k ?I appreciate the help and advice. I am new to this  still learning and trying to understand the saving interest rates,btohqsg
1. Only cc I think2. MonthlyYou should explore ocbc 360 page for detailed info.https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-accountAs of oct 24  ocbc 360 and UOB one interests are still the same as the video you watched. For ur use case  I think ocbc 360 will be better.,btohqsg
Hi  No One Answer of the two questions as below:1). Info can be found on OCBC 360 website.2). Info can be found on OCBC 360 website.https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-account,btohqsg
For all the cc that states min spend  those on exclusion list included in the min spend? E.g. paying for insurance not eligible for cashback but is it counted towards min spend?,btohqsg
Hi  May I check  if I‚Äôm charging my Shopee purchase of 1200  to $200/mth installment via ocbc 365 credit card  will I be eligible to clock for monthly $200 for my 365 credit card for 6 month? (I need to clock $800/mth to get the cashback)Or will I be directly clocked for $1200 for Oct?,btohqsg
Installment usually not counted to spending and no reward,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not too sure also. Maybe I‚Äôll call the bank later to check.,btohqsg
U see card tnc that is what cso refer to as well,btohqsg
Hi all  side question regarding UOB ONE Credit Card  do offline card payments at dental clinics and dermatology clinics qualify for the cc min spend?,btohqsg
should be eligible unless mcc is one of those excluded,btohqsg
Both 0  Shopee's installment plan is using bank's IPP.,btohqsg
Thanks all for the info. üôè,btohqsg
Ok  just checked. it's eligible. UOB ONE Credit Card excludes hospital payments 8062  but dental and ortho  is 8021 and it's not in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
Trying to understand UOB earmark promo. Does it always use sep MAB?Or can i clear my uob one account now and participate in Nov?,btohqsg
Their tnc gave me the impression of sep MAB.,btohqsg
cannot... UOB plunging chicken uses FIXED months' ADB based on our observations.March ADBJune ADBSep ADBDec ADBso no matter which month u earmark  it always refers to one of those ADB.which also means since now the earmark is 5 months.. if you do Plunging Chicken now  you have to sit out the next 2 cycles.,btohqsg
Hi all  for UOB ONE account insurance payment it must be made on a recurring basis to qualify for the 4% interest?,btohqsg
You are asking insurance or hospital or dental ?,btohqsg
and it is for the 1st month only  is that right?,btohqsg
Miss the good ol days just need to clear last day of month then can spam,btohqsg
UOB One account got no insurance criteria. Just salary and spend.,btohqsg
too many gamers like us... UOB cannot tahan...,btohqsg
Yes i mean if i want to spend the $500 just on insurance but on a non-recurring basis. Do i still qualify for 4%?,btohqsg
Got it. Wait for Dec to clear then.,btohqsg
if you want to take part next round Plunging Chicken (January sign up)..you need to make sure your December UOB One account is $1 001 ADB.,btohqsg
and that's even assuming they will still run another Plunging Chicken if Fed cut another 0.5%...maybe from $1100 to $700 to $300.. u still want?and maybe no more 4% UOB One already,btohqsg
it is not bad actually  can just mean trf the $$$ out after 1st month end. ooppss,btohqsg
This is a risk for sure. Gotta keep monitoring and decide when Jan comes. Dec I need to shuffle my bank account balance anyway for all these cpf  srs things.,btohqsg
That's what people are doing. Nothing new,btohqsg
i didnt know  i usually put for 2 months. and the interest rate dont come in immediately for hsbc.,btohqsg
