Another day  another American fact.In most Us states  there is a government website you can visit to see properties that are filled with property tax  usually 10-15% of the the properties‚Äôs value. If you pay it off  the owner of the property either has to pay you back the amount you paid or forfeit their property to you. After getting the property  you can get a new lease and either sell it or rent it to the owner at a price.How to get rich 101:,btohqsg

I went to see Oppenheimer over Barbie and I think frankly  the story of Oppenheimer and the way it is told is much more important to hear than Barbie.,btohqsg
The movie takes the opposite approach to modern filmmaking  it is a biography after all  and the subject matter is just so dark and impactful,btohqsg
There are parts of the movie where Nolan can make you physically jolt from shock of the sound in the theatre  and the emotion of seeing some of the choices they make is intense man,btohqsg
The intensity is driven not by just noise but the contrast of silence and appearance. It‚Äôs beautiful  not the most happy  but it tries to be true in telling the history of one of the most important things that happened in the last. It made me think quite a bit anyway  about something that remains relevant and true  about choices we make. Important movie for sure.,btohqsg
