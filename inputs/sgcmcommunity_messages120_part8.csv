u know me so well ;),btohqsg
Guys  I got a dilemma in choosing between mazda 3 hb vs octavia 1.5. Both current gen,btohqsg
But personally I would buy the mazda 3,btohqsg
better interior according to me and the hatchback just looks stunning,btohqsg
performance then need to go 2.0,btohqsg
stock car won't be an issue sir,btohqsg
Stock car will have problems too sir,btohqsg
it's the golfs and octavias that are modded and go through multiple owners who don't do repairs,btohqsg
if you decide to not maintain it ever,btohqsg
Turbocharged Vs NA quite obvious which one will be less reliable also,btohqsg
but warranty only 3 to 5 years anyway,btohqsg
after that need to see yourself,btohqsg
so I don't see how the warranty will help,btohqsg
Anyway I got friend who has the 2.0 Octavia the plastic bits in the cabin feel super cheap,btohqsg
In comparison Mazda interior feels more solid,btohqsg
Agree  the mazda interior to me is better,btohqsg
they haven't updated the rest for some reason,btohqsg
by the cx-30 and the 3 is very nice,btohqsg
turbo is the best for the first 5 yearsüòõ,btohqsg
that's y u see the old BMW n Benz can last very long,btohqsg
all about how you maintain as well,btohqsg
but yes N.A. relatively longer lasting if maintained properly,btohqsg
of course both sides have their bad apples with unreliable engines,btohqsg
Both are 2021 car. I am surprised octavia ride is not as comfortable as what people praised online,btohqsg
My mind is thinking of the octavia in terms of money sense because similar depre but cat b coe with more power,btohqsg
But my heart is with m3. So sexy and pretty interior,btohqsg
is the suspension in good shape?,btohqsg
what are your priorities? a nice place to be in or a slightly more powerful engine?,btohqsg
Havent. I thought they are just 1 year plus with less than 20k km  should be safe?,btohqsg
Buy with your ‚ù§Ô∏è... Mantra by alfisti,btohqsg
can is can but better do basic inspection anyway,btohqsg
in case any wear and tear to be done up  can negotiate based on that,btohqsg
120% full loan with ‚ù§Ô∏è also,btohqsg
Haha hb with red interior damn nice but too bad exterior is machine grey and not soul red,btohqsg
20k km driven by a F1 wanabee will be worse condition than a 200k car driven by a slow retiree.üòÇ,btohqsg
Eye opener...I'll consider mazda if I change car lol,btohqsg
The retiree cannot feel the spongy brakes  dying absorbers and spoilt aircon,btohqsg
as long as the retiree's workshop or AD good,btohqsg
and he just pays the bill,btohqsg
these are small prob compared to engine n gearboxüòõ,btohqsg
As long as retiree doesn't skip alll the repairs,btohqsg
Brake failure when coming down from genting,btohqsg
just saw 1 broke down this morning SL plate,btohqsg
How does mild hybrid compare against honda's hybrid? Or they are similar?,btohqsg
Wah I see the fc between the 2  cannot compare,btohqsg
hearsay Prius is the best if FC is your thang,btohqsg
prius full tank 1000km  only if ur battery health good leh,btohqsg
the battery health will degrade over time,btohqsg
My current D2D ride is around 900km per tank,btohqsg
Drive to Malaysia I can get 550km üòÇ,btohqsg
