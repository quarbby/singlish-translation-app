When we try to cancel two days before the job start with valid reason. Few days later reason invalid without giving a notice sms and straight away suspend.Do they really read up btwn CS and driver convo at the first place?Whats the timeline cancellation if accepting the job?,btohqsg
How abt accidentally accepting two job same time with two different location?,btohqsg
"The location and timings are all published clearly before the driver accepts the job  so ""accidentally take"" is not a valid reason.",btohqsg
unless customer changes job details after job is accepted.,btohqsg
I see. Theres no timeline for cancellation?,btohqsg
They will raise fare for customer... But still pay us peanuts...beggars cannot be choosy,btohqsg
llm works on commission. if they charge more  they earn more  we also earn more. Start at $100 instead of $10... obviously won't work  all the cx will look elsewhere. The fees are as high as they dare to raise them already.,btohqsg
all will go for spc cannot fight,btohqsg
