What I did was what mattered,btohqsg
Sir pls watch Ben Felix on YT,btohqsg
So many ppl fundamentals of investing all screwed up from god knows what  I think movies or whatever,btohqsg
Ppl watch Wall Street and wolf of Wall Street,btohqsg
Think they’re shouting buy self buy sell on individual stocks,btohqsg
"right now your predicament...you are alr passing chinese  so just mantain that...but dont ""give up"" on humans  like just learn AQF(Answer Question First) and inference for all the SBQ's....still can get marks.Your tuition teacher should be redirected to chi as she can teach that subject better on you  since her way of teachning humans has not yielded you a pass",btohqsg
oh yea its a carpet cleaner,btohqsg
You only have 3 levers you can change in the equation.1. When you start.2. How much you pay someone to do the investments.3. What extent you diversify.,btohqsg
The rest is just as good as gravity,btohqsg
Pls watch Ben Felix  for personal finance education  legit one of the best YT channels I ever watched,btohqsg
Not many other channels I can say have the same kind of quality,btohqsg
He don’t sell u anything no promotions no sponsors,btohqsg
Just very specific and to the point of his view,btohqsg
Yes it can be  but as long as the world keeps producing value it is not,btohqsg
If got new iPhone next year I will make money,btohqsg
thats why its a pyramid scheme,btohqsg
If got HDB to buy next year I also make money,btohqsg
Doesn’t make sense to me to call it that  cause pyramid schemes are designed without the intention to grow sustainably,btohqsg
u step into shopping mall = help me make money,btohqsg
the world economy wont grow forever,btohqsg
When you invest responsibly you create value  which includes sustainable models of growth,btohqsg
I mean i can see it  capitalism in general is not sustainable since its built on exploitation of nature resources,btohqsg
only economists believe in infinite growth,btohqsg
Not my problem to worry about cause I only need it to survive another 100 years max,btohqsg
humans are so miniscule that the resources can be considered infinite,btohqsg
But pyramid scheme is usually characterized by need of exponential expansion  which makes it unsustainable,btohqsg
So while technically u can say that  it doesnt serve any purpose with respect to discussion,btohqsg
the stock market grows by % annually (roughly),btohqsg
Which comes from exploitation of natural resources,btohqsg
I think the real issue is typically down to the lack of value being transacted in the scheme or network.If there is value transacted the system can sustain. If not it is all consuming it collapses quickly.,btohqsg
I feel like this company should become a government agency at this point,btohqsg
Mhm ok thats a better differentiating factor,btohqsg
Islamic finance holds that Riba (interest) is haram,btohqsg
Literally Yishun Towing and EMAS...are the two most used towing companies,btohqsg
So all of their loans are just purchase agreements where the bank earns money on the sale of the asset to you  you make installments of a fixed rate,btohqsg
oh wait nvm...EMAss is govt contracted not this,btohqsg
But you still end up making money just like interest lol,btohqsg
wait..does SPF have a contract with this towing company,btohqsg
They just don’t call it interest  but many of the outcomes are like interest/debt obligations. However I do think some of their finance principles are kinder/less harsh.,btohqsg
I just can't do it the way it is taught in NS,btohqsg
I'll pull myself up as my boots slide down the rope  making use of the upwards force of friction to help propel me up,btohqsg
Sir this is LTA Emergency Motor assistance,btohqsg
oh yea so its a govt agency,btohqsg
I didn't have technique. So my method looks as though I'm pulling myself up by pure arm power when it's not,btohqsg
not a private one..like yishun towing,btohqsg
They only tow if you blocking a public road,btohqsg
And they tow to the clossst carpark only,btohqsg
oh then this towing company associated with the govt?,btohqsg
i see them always towing cars used for evidence in crimes or govt assets,btohqsg
Does it mean Emas cant tow a govt vehicle..if not there is a conflict of interest,btohqsg
