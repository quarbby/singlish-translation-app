My guess is because their Govt subsidize like Siao. Because if they don’t  people feel in kampungs or ulu areas will have a big problem affording it  it’s probably meant to help the neediest level to be able to move around. If not  they’d be stuck in their ulu kampungs. That’s my observation when I was doing bicycle touring in Malaysia obviously before Covid.SG I don’t think there is any subsidy at all.,btohqsg
Hmm  unless a car specifies high octane  otherwise it’s just wasted money for a premium that no one needs.High compression ratio  then would require high octane. Lots of sources online too to countercheck.,btohqsg
Their subsidy is only for grades below 97 I think.. that's why foreign cars can pump grade below 97. But the prices for 97 is still damn low?!,btohqsg

https://www.carmanual.org/OwnersManual/toyota/2015_toyota_camry-1.pdfI think personally while I don’t have a Class 3/3A licence  I’ll trust the engineers. But im sure there are many more experts in the real world who would disagree with Toyota’s engineering teams.,btohqsg
