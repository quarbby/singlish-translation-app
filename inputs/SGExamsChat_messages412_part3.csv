my point is that I shouldn’t have even qualified,btohqsg
I remembered working hard for psle.. (copying answer sheet),btohqsg
also  I might not have even made it to JC if it wasn’t for IP,btohqsg
was damn tough you know  always had to hide from my mother,btohqsg
my mum describes her three kids like this,btohqsg
btw what's the min to cont ip ..,btohqsg
My brother: steal answer sheetMy sister: do the work properly and mark herselfMe: too lazy to even bother stealing answers,btohqsg
I js feel like as much there is ITE and all.. some fields are not as accepting of students with certain certs,btohqsg
idk how my mum was so chill with it tho,btohqsg
like she let me watch tv during psle period,btohqsg
and I rmb only reading the science book out of pure interest,btohqsg
my friend went for MOE scholarship interview got asked what changes he’d make to the PSLE system,btohqsg
Idk I just applied to the sch and it auto puts you in IP unless you choose to go o levels after sec 2 or your grades cmi like below 3 I think,btohqsg
Oh that was a while ago. He contracting at a sch now,btohqsg
Continue? Mine was average gpa 3.0 (60%) for 6 subs with minimum 2.5 (55%) for math and English,btohqsg
I mean sure there is ITE and all  idt the problem lies in the education system  but it's the people who interview fresh grads.. imagine they get a 50 year old to interview a fresh grad who has great skills but let's just say prolly js a dip or ite cert  they wouldn't understand how skills are valued    and like as much as our edu system is improving  it's companies how are at fault not being able to accept the newer gen way of learning,btohqsg
so it's js 3.0 ah basically,btohqsg
oh then my brother is fine why is he stressed DAFUQ,btohqsg
It varies from school to school   e..g some school 3.0 is higher or lower %Then some school 4.0 also higher or lower %It variesAnd some school varies GPA like 3.0 3.5 4.0Some 3.0 3.2 3.4Blah blahDepends,btohqsg
yk my grammar doesn't make sense but the idea is being put across and that's all that matters rn bcz I am not ok iw to slp,btohqsg
I used to get GPA 0 for chem lol   verge of retaining 💀,btohqsg
Public perception is that Anything that isn’t express -> JC -> Uni (in STEM or like business) is inferior,btohqsg
At least people more accepting of poly now,btohqsg
end of day  also lies on the human and our ever changing world  diploma used to be q hireable  sure there's internship but wld they choose a dip kid or degree. who knows as I study in uni  Bach is needed for basic application 😀😀😀 i wil literalky kms,btohqsg
anything that isn’t SMU NTU or NUS also will look down,btohqsg
so far I've only heard of dorector list kids only which is like 10-15,btohqsg
the reality is that in many cases to employers  Uni cert is more about demonstrating higher capability of learning,btohqsg
You know my concern about career is directly opposite,btohqsg
being overqualified is a real thing,btohqsg
But like lowkey...sign on... not bad 💀,btohqsg
we have si Yan n kuro talking to each other the complete opposites,btohqsg
Spf sign on no need tekong right,btohqsg
wat happen to burette mindset bruh,btohqsg
I meannn the odds of landing the job I want as a professor is like <<10% but most jobs don’t require a PhD,btohqsg
And there’s quite a few stigmas surrounding a PhD,btohqsg
fr fr 🙏 one like one prayer,btohqsg
well  over qualified is better than under qualified no??,btohqsg
wait can u not apply a normal job as a PhD,btohqsg
u better be kidding there were tears alr,btohqsg
no I'm only 4 go in,btohqsg
but is it not better than ntg,btohqsg
Too specialised for the industry/company sth sth right? I heard a bit,btohqsg
never my life I wanna get a PhD so like this is fresh ya,btohqsg
ok good pt but I only care for myself so 🙏 HAHAH JK,btohqsg
Yea a few things like 1) only know your field dk anything else that’s industry relevant or no skills 2) only know books cannot work in a company 3) problems given to you are “too easy” and you’ll quit soon,btohqsg
even if you willing to settle,btohqsg
they think you’re just there for a short while until you find a good deal,btohqsg
my father was telling me abt it   this guy go Cambridge and all now he's only manager,btohqsg
who wants an employee that’s there for a short time,btohqsg
so the best move for me is simultaneously pursue my PhD will getting industry experience and skills on the side,btohqsg
