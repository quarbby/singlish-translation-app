anyways..if i were to rundown whatever was said in rp from start to end..it was drama from start to end,btohqsg
its sec sch express but on drugs,btohqsg
But like most ppl using facial cleanser incorrectly,btohqsg
rp tele became a cesspool for everybody from all walks of life,btohqsg
This is my future this is my country,btohqsg
there was too much and too many ppl,btohqsg
Bro at least its representative of everyone,btohqsg
Btw did y'all know if u use cleansers with active ingredients u needa leave it on ur face for a few mins bef washing off,btohqsg
ITE is literally just a sewage tank,btohqsg
Bro the girl... blink twice if she's being held hostage,btohqsg
bro decided to give himself a new rank,btohqsg
from rp biotech to nus cs,btohqsg
Bro why u gotta drag my course in dis,btohqsg
that look in the video is an npc,btohqsg
Thats just H2 bio with extra steps,btohqsg
some 28 yr old guy in rp went to np tele and ask a girl very weird qns..then that rp guy got blasted across all the relevant telegram grps in sg,btohqsg
Wait till u get to RNA and DNA transcription and replication,btohqsg
I could be a physics taker,btohqsg
i already learned that in upper sec pure bio,btohqsg
@kohsyanwill do the honour of answering,btohqsg
Tell me the function of the TATA box.,btohqsg
what the hell is a tata box,btohqsg
i thought you alr broke up with tatabusa,btohqsg
The specific sequence that encodes and decodes DNA..,btohqsg
is when one neutron attack thhe target nucleus and split into smaller nuclei,btohqsg
even if she were taking physics that's like the last topic LOL,btohqsg
Physics bio chem and h1 geog,btohqsg
bruh why suddenly everybody joining a ded serv,btohqsg
the drama has been long gone. a bunch of them already left the tele grp,btohqsg
R you gnna retake as PFMg,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/FaVHTd9Ne_s?si=2GBvL6sjDYrHIxvJBiomed FYP projects are basically something like dis,btohqsg
If u ever went to the projector their start sequence is fucking brilliant,btohqsg
@chemcerif you retake h2 bio ill paynow you 2 dollars,btohqsg
Matcha the paper alone costs like 200 bucks,btohqsg
ppl dicussing abt the vid of a girl on a bot's profile,btohqsg
there was a leaked vid of a bj on a tele acc...they are talking about the girl in that vid saying she has a big forehead,btohqsg
Why is always about yt retaking As,btohqsg
So you need bio to talk abt bj?,btohqsg
Is not meeee  is the photo,btohqsg
folks this is why you think before you type,btohqsg
Iâ€™m sorry my notes have taken over my brain,btohqsg
I asked what is the bio for I SWEAR,btohqsg
guys bj is obviously blackjack stop having dirty minds,btohqsg
Idt yt will take h2 bio,btohqsg
Heard the jump is large uh from o level,btohqsg
Idk i dont take h2 bio lol,btohqsg
Idk i didnt take o level but i dont think its that different from y4 bio,btohqsg
Bruh this is very subjective..for me I didnâ€™t take coz I feel phy easier to score,btohqsg
In our lab there's something called Fetal Bovine Serum,btohqsg
Was told the jump is cus more chemical and molecular kind in a levels than body parts and ecology in o levels,btohqsg
oh maybe cause for us ip the y4 syllabus got more molecular bio lor,btohqsg
No wonder both of u get along,btohqsg
Bioengineering I think can get those device manufacturers gig,btohqsg
tbh i feel like a large proportion of ppl ik who like bio are either going into biomedical sciences or medicine,btohqsg
Like I have no idea how the fuck to maintain a flow cytometer,btohqsg
i've barely met anyone interested in ecology/zoology tbh,btohqsg
lol i guess youâ€™re even more innocent  than me since even i know what it means,btohqsg
"and i see alot of ppl online only going into bio because ""pre med""",btohqsg
"You're giving off  "" what is a personal private life"" vibes",btohqsg
This is giving me some clue,btohqsg
Her parents dont even allow her to join the cca she wants in jc,btohqsg
Imma assume you'd know what I'm referring to,btohqsg
I survived first 2y with little / no interactions coz everything was zooming,btohqsg
The people I connect most to in uni are my cca friends,btohqsg
Even if u find me also I couldn't give a shit,btohqsg
Time to get back to torture brb,btohqsg
U give me 16 or 14 like nonstop sia,btohqsg
I bust before you cuz I had to draw,btohqsg
14 vs a dealer 10 who in the fuck,btohqsg
I bought in at 2 dollars,btohqsg
And it's just yall give chance I auto button,btohqsg
If I big blind I draw 2 8 non suit wtf I do bruh,btohqsg
Tbh if u really fucked up so much at that bj u can end up doing the other meaning la,btohqsg
heres come putin saying ukraine is invovled,btohqsg
Join us degenerates.. who the heck bets like half their stack in bj,btohqsg
i love gambling but i suck at it,btohqsg
Blackjack there's literally no skill one bruh,btohqsg
at least it's not 100% luck,btohqsg
Bro that one the amount of rules is just ridiculous,btohqsg
lol i've taught a few international friends and,btohqsg
the only thing i currently don't understand is counting tai,btohqsg
smh im kinda used to the game,btohqsg
"one of them described it as ""i swear some of these rules you'd think they're just made up on the fly""",btohqsg
Only works if u have a shoe.,btohqsg
it's kinda interesting once you know how probability works,btohqsg
wah card counting is a skill,btohqsg
U can only do that in casino bruh,btohqsg
Like legit no normal ppl will have a shoe,btohqsg
oh this site ah..my friend was gambling in rp,btohqsg
bro dumped $100  earned $600 over 1hr+..decided to halve his winnings on the final 2nd round he played that morning,btohqsg
this is the hand i alw dream of,btohqsg
what. what combi u going for,btohqsg
Just that ranked is paid access,btohqsg
but now the ranked games is locked behind paywall ah,btohqsg
Errr have u done GEM exchange before,btohqsg
Bro i can't believe i js lost a match because of pure stupidity,btohqsg
What the heck does Recommended provisionally mean bruh,btohqsg
We literally had a brdm-2 but my team fking threw,btohqsg
I oni use steam for TF2,btohqsg
But left cuz too many bots,btohqsg
I miss the time of the friendlies,btohqsg
y1 only how do lol ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
i matriculate aug last year only how be y2 haha,btohqsg
Oh that means we same batch lor ig,btohqsg
Walao eh. Got no one to ask help for dis shit,btohqsg
Oh i had the impression you were the same year as me,btohqsg
Same I tot he was a Y2,btohqsg
Even Y2 people may not know any of this (me),btohqsg
how u all think im y2 haha ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ask liao all dk.. cuz covid also means their time the slots not fully recovered,btohqsg
Idk bruh it's just the authority of your sentences,btohqsg
Hey its a compliment.. I tryna say u sound like u know what u doing,btohqsg
oh u r that guy haha,btohqsg
i thought u should know im y1 cause itâ€™s in my dc name for the entire month bef i took down after admissions closed haha,btohqsg
I don't put it in my name cuz often ppl ask dumb questions especially for humanities,btohqsg
i know the application process for GEM but not the experience itself bc i got offered a place before covid fucked me lol,btohqsg
GEM it's the NTU exchange program,btohqsg
the other guy was asking about it,btohqsg
History often ppl ask me about historical events which I have no idea and don't study about. Honestly History majors don't just study WW2 and cold War lmao,btohqsg
In fact it's a specialisation to do so and it isn't like secondary or jc History,btohqsg
Yeah. I have to base matching data on 2019,btohqsg
To what do i owe the pleasure,btohqsg
Hearsay 3-5 pu3 retained this yr and they manage to do so cause their Cher spoke up for them apparently,btohqsg
Just do A levels nice nice once and for all lah why must come back to hell again,btohqsg
It's from my GP Cher too and he took pu3 last yr,btohqsg
the thing idgi is why ppl dropout to take As on their own..,btohqsg
like man it isn't 1-2 sub,btohqsg
Oh it happens more often in MI than we think,btohqsg
Some people drop out y2 if they retain to take A levels next year,btohqsg
And then end up failing As,btohqsg
Even the Cher also dk why,btohqsg
Like you retained for a reason...? Then you drop out just to fail...?,btohqsg
Oh ya the one classmate  idl mentioned that,btohqsg
Might as well don't come mi self study as priv cand,btohqsg
MI really has weird people like that,btohqsg
It's just the two letters switcheroo,btohqsg
Missing one h at the end too,btohqsg
Literally 2 pu3 who were  part of CCA exco team dropped out,btohqsg
okay i dont know whats going on with our school but thats cray',btohqsg
even if let's say u did well for As..,btohqsg
the uk sgc personal portfolio how,btohqsg
as someone who graduated from MI,btohqsg
As someone who never did JC/MI you guys are weird lmao and this is coming from someone who had to write NIL on school in my uni application,btohqsg
But did it twice la once in 2021 and then 2022,btohqsg
What qualification you used to enter uni?,btohqsg
I had a tutor for maths and paid for some consults for econs but other than that not rlly,btohqsg
Either ways got S for Maths tho,btohqsg
Self study for As without dropping out from Jc/mi,btohqsg
I thought local uni only accepts ppl who pass all their content subs tho,btohqsg
Like if you fail GP or any one of the 4 content subs instantly canâ€™t get in without another qualification,btohqsg
Eh I didnâ€™t know even H1 content can fail,btohqsg
A pass in all H2 content subjects.,btohqsg
It's a subject wdym cannot fail,btohqsg
I mean like I thought once any of the 4 content subs fail they wonâ€™t even consider the application,btohqsg
Under the 90rp system at least,btohqsg
No in fact u can fail all 4 and it still will be considered,btohqsg
Cuz RP system just requires a good RP,btohqsg
A fail in all defo will get laughed out by Big 3 la,btohqsg
U are entitled to give NUS 15 dollars to laugh at you,btohqsg
Idk I don't pay much attention to the cost tbf it's negligible imo,btohqsg
Then again ah all S in Alevels nets you a 22.5RP... I don't even think poly will accept that,btohqsg
at that point you're better off using your O level score to enter poly lmao,btohqsg
dont even use your A level score to enter poly with all S,btohqsg
RP If u get like 40RP just use your alevels cuz 2.5 or 2 year course instead of 3,btohqsg
U don't need to do all the fluff bs general mods,btohqsg
40 rp should be very attainable  PW is already at minimum B or A,btohqsg
oh wait the new syllabus pw is p/f,btohqsg
Yeah exactly just get at least an E in 2 of your H2 subjects,btohqsg
And an E in your GP,btohqsg
Either ways is S really pulls down your average so u can guess what my RP would have to be and my other subjects to pull up that S,btohqsg
seeing that you've made it to NTU,btohqsg
your other subjects mustve been minimum Bs,btohqsg
or average Bs  probably one or two As?,btohqsg
pretty damn impressive for self study',btohqsg
I know MI is weird cuz I took MOB and had to steal notes from an MI kid,btohqsg
commerce stream is just weird as a whole,btohqsg
It's easy to score if u can just talk bs tho,btohqsg
its not difficult if you have the drive to do so,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorwhen applying to NP did you use a level results or o levels btw,btohqsg
but to me who has wasted an entire saturday doing nothing when i wanted to do something  yeah its pretty hard,btohqsg
It was just tiring for me cuz I did it concurrently,btohqsg
But yeah it's possible if u eat snake in NS,btohqsg
looking back  yeah anyone could but the motivation was hard to find when i was at that stage,btohqsg
Yeah it's a lonely journey ngl,btohqsg
not easy when i had friends who rather play than study tbh,btohqsg
but that says more about me losing to that peer pressure i guess,btohqsg
it's motivation and also kinda knowing how to self study,btohqsg
i was even playing csgo during the midst of As so,btohqsg
Na it's also the psychological trauma of being left out,btohqsg
both of which i still do not grasp,btohqsg
a lot of people have trouble initially in uni partly bc of the structure they're used to from jc and earlier,btohqsg
Ya but he say like 40+rp can use it for poly,btohqsg
So thatâ€™s why I want to know which you used to apply,btohqsg
I don't even how what am I doing even now tbh I just react based on what I have.,btohqsg
getting spawned killed the moment you come out because you dont know the spawn peeks spots,btohqsg
yeah i've been reacting for the past 3 sems,btohqsg
i think i still slack alot gg,btohqsg
its not that it isnt going decently well for me  but i think i can do better than decent,btohqsg
Oh ok  there isnâ€™t much info I can find online about applying using a level results,btohqsg
Just wanna find out how it works,btohqsg
And how they decide which modules you can skip,btohqsg
The H2 requirements are strict tho if u fuck up on H2s u gone,btohqsg
Still havenâ€™t decided but if I do may be next year and not this,btohqsg
Idk if I got enough time study,btohqsg
I left and now apparently I still qualify for a part time diploma if I want,btohqsg
Plus right if I get rejected I might have to retake my h1 content so thatâ€™s more important,btohqsg
For like 2 years with a lower load and for like 2k,btohqsg
If I get A will pull up my rp by 2.5,btohqsg
Ngl idk if I should just do that,btohqsg
Iâ€™ll try to study as much as I can during my free time,btohqsg
No legit it's dumb u get all the downfalls and responsibilities of uni without the freedom and lax,btohqsg
I jumped to Molecular DNA biology and full on genetics before we even learnt like microbiology and advanced biology,btohqsg
If you think you can get 90rp do it lo if not you just wasting more time,btohqsg
Idk who the heck designed it that way,btohqsg
There were so many dropouts ngl,btohqsg
Oh ya your ord is one more year,btohqsg
Then I guess itâ€™s just money,btohqsg
Just entering the class and be like oh were did she go one day there next day gone,btohqsg
at this point you're just smurfing in A levels,btohqsg
I still legit donâ€™t know your real grades lol,btohqsg
But wtv la if you retake hopefully you hit it,btohqsg
i can harbor a pretty accurate guess,btohqsg
but i shall not do that,btohqsg
Iâ€™m guessing all are A to C,btohqsg
To P to E to R to M to A to N,btohqsg
If u made it to uni from poly,btohqsg
honestly if you can make it from poly to uni,btohqsg
nothing in uni should faze you anymore,btohqsg
The odds are stacked against your favour especially big 3,btohqsg
most people i know from poly are already the ones that are doing well from sem 1 onwards tbh (at least the ones that came from relevant poly dip to relevant uni major),btohqsg
Bruh I chose Alevel cuz getting a 3.5 is harder and more stressful,btohqsg
if i go to poly i aint getting a 3.5 lmao thats why i had to do A levels,btohqsg
Just go back to taking h1 geog if you retake,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorto get a 3.5 the work I have to do is write an analysis report and understand the image I sent u,btohqsg
Then maybe you need someone to mark your work,btohqsg
Bro not worth my sanity for that hell no,btohqsg
That one need to ask your old chers or get tuition,btohqsg
Might be sth to do with the new syllabus which is why I see more fluctuations between prelim grades to As,btohqsg
Bruh OK..  for h2 bio students just to give yall context,btohqsg
Besides me thereâ€™s quite a few others I expected to get A end up B/C for a levels,btohqsg
You know gel electrophoresis doing that in the lab,btohqsg
When u try to load the sample into the wells,btohqsg
It's like tryna do that but with no spillage + steadily and accurately + the Wells are less defined,btohqsg
I think new syllabus they also changed the way they mark but itâ€™s not very clear,btohqsg
He retook everything cos other H2s screwed up?,btohqsg
My cher kept talking about the 2 requirements thing,btohqsg
Plus she said they care more about proper explanations,btohqsg
There's a joke bro. I spent 2 years learning how to use a micropipette,btohqsg
From what they heard during marking workshops,btohqsg
I know how to take up 1/1000th of a drop.,btohqsg
2nd case I heard of someone doing Econs in both 2022 and 2023 and getting a worse grade in 2023,btohqsg
Hais maybe the extra time is a curse in disguise,btohqsg
They probably became more picky in certain areas Iâ€™m not sure off,btohqsg
So he basically got 2h15min for the same paper,btohqsg
Lol yeah Cambridge was very lazy in 2023,btohqsg
I rmbr my Econs tutor was surprised,btohqsg
I think last time there was a syllabus change the papers werenâ€™t the same,btohqsg
Yeah likely they adjust the grade boundaries to make up for it,btohqsg
Yall making me feel old fr,btohqsg
The last time i did h1 econs we had essays...,btohqsg
Either 10 15 or 25m essay,btohqsg
I also donâ€™t know exactly what else  but I suspect besides a slight change in marking  they did some other small stuff-remove 2nd and 3rd degree price discrimination-add cognitive bias which was previously only in moe h3-no need to know mathematical illustration for comparative advantage-a few other minor changes such as emphasis on some other things  and I canâ€™t think of these other changes at the top of my head,btohqsg
Content wise not a lot was changed rly,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not as drastic as the new geog/history syllabus change,btohqsg
There always was what the last question for your case study,btohqsg
I meant a seperate essay qns apart from the sbq,btohqsg
Like thats how long ago my h1 econs was lmao,btohqsg
Which is why ngl H1 Econs not worth it,btohqsg
I legit didn't think there was a lot of difference between H1 and H2 econs in terms of content width,btohqsg
i was gonna do h1 lit at first,btohqsg
but someone told me h1 econs easier to score A,btohqsg
wah long enough but idw age doxx so HAHAH,btohqsg
But still not as long ago as when the time when there was mcq in Econs (before the h1 h2 system came about lol),btohqsg
They call it higher order qns not case study,btohqsg
But yeah itâ€™s essentially an essay,btohqsg
Iinw before the 2017 syllabus revision h1 Econs had a legit essay section,btohqsg
What year did you take the exam?,btohqsg
mhmm just around that period before the revision,btohqsg
Maybe 2023 paper was just bad for some of us  hopefully I get better luck should I retake,btohqsg
2019 we don't have essay section uh  but then have this essay type of qn in the source based study qns,btohqsg
Yeah so thatâ€™s the new syllabus alr,btohqsg
The then new syllabus I mean  cos 2017 had a new syllabus,btohqsg
Yea  IN the source based study qns,btohqsg
There is only 1 section for h1 econs,btohqsg
Yeah which is why ngl i legit think H1 econs not worth,btohqsg
Inside that section  has 1 qn which is ALSO an essay section,btohqsg
Call me biased but H1 History was worth it,btohqsg
i still legit think h1 econs is the easiest to score A for leh,btohqsg
At least compared to the hell of H2,btohqsg
Mine was like prelims fell slightly from mye but still very high,btohqsg
I want to h1 lit  but parents told mw h1 econs better,btohqsg
of course i may be bias too,btohqsg
But basically I peak in internal exams,btohqsg
I hated h1 econs and regretted it lmao,btohqsg
h1 lit wannabe but takes h1 econs,btohqsg
To be or not to be? That's the question,btohqsg
I mean my prelims was a B but higher than like 90% of the cohort lol,btohqsg
my ass got a U for prelims and my h1 econs teacher was like you're gone,btohqsg
U had a Modest and gradual appreciation of your grades,btohqsg
Cos mine was 65% raw but I rmbr asking around and those who got high 50s alr 5th quintile,btohqsg
jumped from the lowest grade to the highest grade and she had nothing to say about that,btohqsg
I got a C for H1 Econs  while friend slept through 1h in the econs paper,btohqsg
i think its just my school that doesnt appreciate my answering style for h1 econs,btohqsg
My history in Secondary school always had a C or D I knew she was doing it om purpose when my Sec 4 prelims was 49,btohqsg
I forgot what was your combi you took in 2022  was in CMEg? Then 2023 FMCE?,btohqsg
If your f math is like B and above and you actually retake keep f math,btohqsg
Else should prolly switch to h1 geog,btohqsg
If i were to replay time  i would take PCMl,btohqsg
I wanted to take it but I couldn't find resources,btohqsg
Also I am more of a narrative guy,btohqsg
Plus you can talk about who is right or wrong,btohqsg
Ell is very technical  I donâ€™t think itâ€™s the right subject for everyone,btohqsg
Huh? U really wanna pick a stance?,btohqsg
Like lit would be more appealing than ell for most,btohqsg
Even in history I never did pick a stance which was why I always got shit grades in school,btohqsg
Yea  like pick a stance without numbers and stats,btohqsg
Cuz my teachers always wanted you to just follow the narrative they teach,btohqsg
You choose who should bella pick,btohqsg
But tbh idk twilight story so ...,btohqsg
Ngl I think that's the wrong way to do humanities but then again I only got my first intro into lit when I did an English seminar.,btohqsg
I mean of course you have to look at both sides uh,btohqsg
And then make a fair judgement,btohqsg
Hmm when I written my essays I never did make any judgements or even attempted it.,btohqsg
U can and most do that for SEAB exams,btohqsg
But if u do end up doing it for uni don't do that for humanities as it would be anachronistic at best and just hypocritical at worse.,btohqsg
as in because i had a friend in MI who would study day and night for h1 geog  only to come out with D for A levels,btohqsg
idk how he studied la but,btohqsg
i always had the impression after that  that h1 geog is torture,btohqsg
Apparently for econs is like having a formula,btohqsg
like actually study studied  not like oh i studied but nothing go in (me),btohqsg
And correct structure to get the marks,btohqsg
I did that too lmao first time I did Alevels I self study for 6 months no experience,btohqsg
Come out C for H2 History,btohqsg
I finished an entire tys during the june holidays,btohqsg
Like Es and Ds  but idk honestly that says more about my sch?,btohqsg
my school nobody passes h1 geog for some reason,btohqsg
Nobody in my sch can complete h2 chem or phy prac,btohqsg
Man did not write finish the planning section,btohqsg
Wait so you just retake a levels uh,btohqsg
Kidding haha  not blank  but I didn't know how to get the marks,btohqsg
My physics planning was also blank (but not the reason u think of),btohqsg
Somehow i got a b for h2 chem and h2 phy even though i nvr completed planning,btohqsg
2020 nuclear planning kenna cancelled ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
it could have been an A,btohqsg
a lvl science subjects r soooo cringe,btohqsg
Luckily as a physics major  i dont have to deal with timed practicals,btohqsg
I still have no idea a month later lol,btohqsg
can even go drink kopi in the middle of experiments,btohqsg
just get the first class next,btohqsg
But man is dropping to 2nd,btohqsg
go retake after you get your degree,btohqsg
Cus for real i have 2 profs with weird marking moderations. AUTOCORRECT: 3 PROFS*,btohqsg
20 years later no one cares,btohqsg
Engineering lab also. 3h lab session but everyone finish in 1.5-2h and zao lol,btohqsg
Oh for me i just chit chat lmao,btohqsg
"""Well i dont need to deal w this shit  byeee""",btohqsg
angle of incidence = angle of reflection,btohqsg
Lol eee no one bother chatting everyone want to faster zao,btohqsg
I'm gonna spend some time reading up on IB HL Option D,btohqsg
light up a mosquito coil to get that spark,btohqsg
I have tons of pdfs but haven't read,btohqsg
was a good excuse to get a new massive e reader,btohqsg
haizz the r/s posts strike again,btohqsg
before that I bought some books also haven't read.But quite nice decor for my otherwise empty bookshelf,btohqsg
pervert senior?while iâ€™m on reddit  i might as well ask for some advice about senior junior relationship. long story short  thereâ€™s this playboy senior who has apparently set his eyes on me. info is kind of unstable as it comes from another jc1  however theyâ€™ve been in the same sch previously so itâ€™s not really that untrustworthy. the senior is the nicest to me out of all the other seniors  who apparently dislike me due to (reason i canâ€™t say cos it may dox me). however the reason is also kind of unreasonable  but cos my schl is very toxic  i canâ€™t do shit abt it. but now heâ€™s the only nice senior i hv  if i make enemies with him it might bring my downfall in cca. our cca needs to be quite closely bonded also  to work better and have more teamwork. but the stuff i heard abt this senior is that he is only nice for a reason. i donâ€™t have the best figure  but my frnd say that he has been involved in some things bfr. so the way heâ€™s nice to me is only cos he wants smthng. we went out three times alrdy  as friends of course  but itâ€™s weird also cos we just met 2 weeks ago. i normally make frnds easily  and although some of them have motives  none of them are ever as difficult as this one. i can satisfy ppleâ€™s motives if theyâ€™re reasonable  but for this senior i cant and wont give him what he wants  hence im quite troubled. the senior himself also admitted that he was a playboy  he so called changed though. so now im weighing my survival in school (senior is popular too) against my dignity and self esteem.,btohqsg
i used to always download the textbook for mods before the sem starts,btohqsg
half the time it never gets used,btohqsg
at some point i do want a bookshelf of textbooks,btohqsg
griffiths is the gateway for it,btohqsg
it's a good backdrop for a zoom meeting,btohqsg
then when look at the physical chem it's all just easy shit,btohqsg
there's a few i have in mind to get,btohqsg
>$100 for one piece of a backdrop,btohqsg
print just the book cover and wrap around an empty corn flakes box,btohqsg
only textbook i currently own hard copy of is young and freedman,btohqsg
spend the money on an e reader instead,btohqsg
i used my tablet for that,btohqsg
10.2 inch kindle scribeso the 13.3 inch from China type that my wife just bought,btohqsg
e reader easier on the eyes,btohqsg
I reached the age where everything is about protecting my organs and healthand making sure they last as long as they can,btohqsg
chapter 8 and doesn't sound like chem at all,btohqsg
would you like some chem with your physics,btohqsg
actually seeing the other group hor  i thank god i took h1 oni,btohqsg
yea if you're looking at orbitals and stuff you need quantum mechanics,btohqsg
"it's not quantum ""mechanics"" just quantum ""physics""",btohqsg
bc there isn't much to it,btohqsg
my h1 class is pampered by such a good cher,btohqsg
i think we 1st time he came to h1,btohqsg
can u recall my memory what was ur combi,btohqsg
yea a lot of it is very qualitative stuff,btohqsg
that's why it's quantum physics not mechanics,btohqsg
oh ya and their heisenberg uncertainty principle is simplified for some reason where they just take it as larger than h,btohqsg
wait why is xray in chem lol,btohqsg
oh then u say u took H2 phy,btohqsg
and my brain lapsed...no chem but somehow took h3 chem,btohqsg
like didnt offer h3 or specifically no chem,btohqsg
i heard there is a pharmaceutical one by NUS...sounds fun actually,btohqsg
oh yea idk why i still remembered this but i think the min is 15 or sth,btohqsg
but i only became chem god in j2 lol,btohqsg
Why do u hv this sia,btohqsg
Oh and u changed half ur subjects,btohqsg
Someone changed from chem to fm coz scared of the boiling tube,btohqsg
Wait wait it is a game?,btohqsg
I was in both the leader and the improvement board lmao,btohqsg
Eh u be trolling is it,btohqsg
My gp I think leader from the bottom lol,btohqsg
It was a subject which idk how > 70% S and U,btohqsg
Siyan and Lestin wun like it,btohqsg
Kid i got U for prelims gp,btohqsg
I got E and was 20-40%  then D in MYE was 80-100%,btohqsg
My mom lost her mind because she thought thats it i cant make it to local U anymore,btohqsg
My dad told the teacher during ptc I dun care about my gp,btohqsg
And can he do something about it,btohqsg
My dad's advice was read more newspaper,btohqsg
My dad told the teacher â€˜can u get her to read newspaper and give more homeworkâ€™,btohqsg
Welp all in all GP was really a pain in the ass,btohqsg
Meanwhile there was once I did not accept an S and ask my friend help me fight for marks and I got that 2m needed to pass lol,btohqsg
I hope ur As went fine,btohqsg
Actually what happens if u fail GP,btohqsg
I mean im in ntu now so,btohqsg
meanwhile me: oh wow i passed all my A level subjects somehow,btohqsg
My friend announced to the whole class my results lol,btohqsg
Its just tougher for you to enter local uni + if you do enter local uni you need to do like an english brushing up mod or smth,btohqsg
Me too : eh wait i can enter ntu physics with these grades woo,btohqsg
I remembered all I hope for is C,btohqsg
Unfortunately because of my grades its the uni that chooses me instead of me choosing the uni so i guess im lucky to be here,btohqsg
"was it alr on your mind or was it a ""i can enter a science uni course woo""",btohqsg
Luckily my mt was in a separate cert,btohqsg
My friend and i had this running joke where ntu physics is like our last last choice ever,btohqsg
Idk why we didnt talk about ntu engineering,btohqsg
Means ur phy and math must be good,btohqsg
good or not debatable but it's low cutoff,btohqsg
based on rp its like one of the lowest end ones,btohqsg
so you get half the people that want to do physics,btohqsg
but thats because not many people want to do physics due to its difficulty?,btohqsg
the other half is their only choice that is in STEM,btohqsg
Actually why is coding part of physics department,btohqsg
i think also bc a lot of people that like physics will just go for engineering,btohqsg
ok do it and let us know,btohqsg
the people here are the ones who really like physics and the theories behind it,btohqsg
I was only doing my own subjects in Jc lol,btohqsg
yea unlike bio or chem where it doesn't make sense to do smth else bc chem or bio engineering is just completely diff,btohqsg
i have acquaintances who finish reading the next sem's content even before school starts while im here struggling to even pass,btohqsg
engineering is still just applying physics,btohqsg
and they do it just because of pure interest,btohqsg
My fav subjects in Jc is chem and econs,btohqsg
mine is half half. initially no choice became interest,btohqsg
Comparing the 3 sci  I still prefer chem,btohqsg
im still riding the no interest part but slowly realising thats not sustainable,btohqsg
Actually I remembered As were appearing out of nowhere in promos,btohqsg
maybe not interest but try to appreciate it ba,btohqsg
Wait wait when did u switch,btohqsg
U mean u repeated and switch ah,btohqsg
my friend went poly chem engine -> ntu physics bc she said fuck engineering but not that much interest -> working in engineering,btohqsg
and now said friend is going germany for masters in engineering physics,btohqsg
wow i do not want that sia  i dont want to look at physics anymore after i grad,btohqsg
ps1 has taught me i cant code for shit,btohqsg
Isnâ€™t the erhu the basic one,btohqsg
okay maybe not exactly nothing to do with phy  will have to see,btohqsg
Actually I love the gaohu sound,btohqsg
but for now i would really love to get to teaching i guess,btohqsg
i is from CO too last time,btohqsg
but i played the yang qin,btohqsg
I was only allowed to touch mallets lol,btohqsg
i mean you can always go teach tuition,btohqsg
NIE might be tough bc competitive,btohqsg
yeah thats the plan if NIE doesnt work out,btohqsg
i dont think they have a very high requirement for teaching bah  my friend is teaching in one of those tution centres now,btohqsg
I love gz music but there were performances where I get giddy after that lol,btohqsg
usually not and i mean your deg is in physics so it should be fine,btohqsg
as a y2 phy student lol,btohqsg
