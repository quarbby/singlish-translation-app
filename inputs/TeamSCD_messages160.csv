i went sta sinming they fail me exo n emission number plate n windscreen,btohqsg

I Not sure other center can see those so call fault that they fail u,btohqsg
ya lor if go back sta is cheaper la reinspection fee half the amt,btohqsg
My shuttle also not that nice. Somemore slower than your roc.,btohqsg
I see alot of ppl using mst intake for roc.,btohqsg
Roc ez can buy 2nd hand hahah,btohqsg
They failed my stock tinted windows.,btohqsg
i nv passed once thr only stock altis pass ü§Æ,btohqsg
Anybody tried the Yishun vicom before,btohqsg
That's right. They told me the previous owner changed the rear 3 windows from clear to tinted. I asked if it makes sense to really indent and buy a set of tinted window instead of purely doing a 100% tint film ? He said he dont know  but based on the current set up  its a fail.,btohqsg
I sourced here and there that entire afternoon and and got a quote for around 700$ per piece of window. If you change 3  that is $2.1k.,btohqsg
In the end  i just headed down to vicom opposite the road and fork out another $70+. Cleared without issues,btohqsg
some PI fail inspection because the PI use clear window for homologation before selling.,btohqsg
Sinming sta very strict. Stock tint also check one. Normal,btohqsg
Tried there before. The inspector there still OK. Passed my car with blue headlight tint.,btohqsg
ok cos my inspection due end of month I stay Yishun,btohqsg
But when I went to sin Ming sta for exhaust inspection  the inspector told me my headlight tint fail.,btohqsg
Oh  you live at which part of yishun?,btohqsg
What you drive? Maybe I try to spot.,btohqsg
Ooh I see. I think I saw your car before at yishun,btohqsg
what car u drive bro ?,btohqsg
Try vicom. And try not to wait last minute then go for inspection. If there are really issues  you will need time to rectify,btohqsg
What thing on your car you think fail?,btohqsg
So far I take the car mostly stock,btohqsg
I went for mine about 2 weeks after i received the first notification. I quite kiasu when it comes to this kind of thing.,btohqsg
I never touch anything within the engine Bay,btohqsg
tats u considering sta boonlay or bb vicom,btohqsg
On the contrary. my inspection at vicom was very smooth and positive. Lol,btohqsg
Based on photo  the only think that may fail you is exhaust (if you changed) and tinting,btohqsg
Exhaust stock I not scared haha,btohqsg
cos sta go for reinspec 30+ only,btohqsg
but sta hear liao v scary,btohqsg
You can try STA. If really fail and questionable  try vicom. But i will just go vicom.,btohqsg
