i say that one rayyan project car,btohqsg
u made it sound like u telling him ur next project car,btohqsg
woah no wayyy is that the consequences of his action!? üò® but like bffr  why are u invalidating the reaction of members of the community in the first place? sure your friend apologized and was apparently unaware that he shouldn't be touching things he doesnt own  but it doesn't change the fact that sometimes mistakes  no matter how innocent  aren't forgiven ah.anyway not a big deal  email to the school or what  at most warn him be more careful next time etc and whatnot. from the few times I've spoken to the owner  can tell he's really nice and likely wont be making any police report if nothing was damaged  but doesn't mean yall are allowed to sit on other people's cars okay  take care‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
