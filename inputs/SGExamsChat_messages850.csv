pretty sure is a prep course towards gce n/o levels,btohqsg
general education is not nitec/higher nitec💀,btohqsg
general education can be referred to many things without extra context ma,btohqsg
u add in the word GEP then it makes sense,btohqsg
Sorry for my ambiguous message  just want to find out options if ppl want to take o levels as retake,btohqsg
And I saw ITE GE program somewhere,btohqsg
"if they've ""graduated"" out of their sec sch studies already  ite GEP doesn't apply for such students who wish to retake Os even if it's just a few certain subjects they didn't do well in",btohqsg
but u can check the link calista sent earlier,btohqsg
Is designed for students who failed to graduate school for any reason ?,btohqsg
Like drop out of school that kind ?,btohqsg
but usually its catered to those who are working already & have their own stable source of income,btohqsg
ITE has a thing where if u pass only 1 or 0 subjects in N(A) & N(T) exams after sec 4-- u can try to enrol in a foundation study program,btohqsg
oh ya  ite will also be phasing out DPP (direct poly program) by 2028,btohqsg
Can I ask when is the time period to register as an O level private candidate?,btohqsg
a lot of structural changes as well to the current system thr,btohqsg
Think can find on seab ?,btohqsg
They update the dates alr? I cannot find?,btohqsg
Guys I was playing FC Mobile and found these goofy AHH names,btohqsg
Reason why I asked about private o levels and ite gep,btohqsg
He is close to being adult [18] so ...,btohqsg
Whether he is working idk uh so I think my evaluation is ite gep may not be okay for him.,btohqsg
guys I am looking for friends to play badminton with regularly,btohqsg
my friend told Me I could ask for some badminton buddies here...I am 19 this year finished A level last year:),btohqsg
54.6% of polytechnic grads were in full-time jobs in 2024  with a median gross monthly salary of $2 900.Here are the courses with the best pay:https://str.sg/sXgV#stheadstart,btohqsg
Trying to DIY my own BBT  what sort of milk do the shops use?,btohqsg
i know LiHo uses Australian Farmhouse LHT milk,btohqsg
idk if it was koi or some other brand that uses meiji,btohqsg
oat milk is also an alternative if u don't want to start from scratch,btohqsg
there are worse ones for sure,btohqsg
Do they add extra creamer/butter milk/冰伯克 or is that a thing they only do in China?,btohqsg
uh  usually depends on individual preference,btohqsg
in sg  there's only low fat  normal milk or flavoured milk,btohqsg
some milks have different taste as well because there's the cow vs goat milk version,btohqsg
So we can't get the fancy cream milks they add to the milk in China?,btohqsg
u need to find those specific types,btohqsg
I'm thinking the best we can do in SG would be something like Coffeemate creamer,btohqsg
usually ppl end up mixing their own fancy milk,btohqsg
coz the ones sold in stores dont rly taste right,btohqsg
right as in what they might prefer,btohqsg
https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1YdwdwE58g/Congrats to those who took their o levels results last Friday,btohqsg
guys isit just me or i can't submit my jae application lol,btohqsg
oh god thank god I'm not the only one🙏,btohqsg
I just sent thru jae application request assistance,btohqsg
Not send but at least alert them,btohqsg
Apparently jae portal not fine uh,btohqsg
idk is jae or singpass problem,btohqsg
cus i can't login my singpass even,btohqsg
ya so i don't even know,btohqsg
Last time when Michael Jackson passed away  same happened to Google servers  too many query on his death and they thought it was DDoS attack.,btohqsg
That one on google at that point in time still small matter but government one is a bigger issue  if server not fixed for too long  ppl can miss application deadline for courses which is an even bigger problem here.,btohqsg
does seab or moe even know?,btohqsg
If enough complaints are submitted ofc they will know 😂😂,btohqsg
How long do Taobao refunds take to reach the payment accounts?,btohqsg
depends but usually quite fast within 2 weeks  excluding sat & sun (if u seek a refund while ur items are still stuck in transit  u might get both the refund* money & item LOL),btohqsg
u might also want to monitor how much u paid because u won't really notice when exactly does refunds get deposited back to u,btohqsg
But the good thing is they give out free stuff sometimes,btohqsg
This is my team btw (and yes I'm very p2w),btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/2-taken-to-hospital-60-evacuated-after-fire-at-hdb-flat-in-punggolHappened Yesterday Night on 14 Jan 2025 (around 10pm),btohqsg
no wonder last night the sirens were so piercing around the area,btohqsg
it iss  i could smell the gas leak & fire smoke a few blocks away,btohqsg
In Hougang too a few days ago?,btohqsg
No mbappe but there’s Luka Modric,btohqsg
in hougang a few days ago,btohqsg
"i didn't process the word ""ago""",btohqsg
close to CNY people are cooking overnight,btohqsg
Be careful when dealing with fire,btohqsg
I was in school orientation at my poly and they briefly tell us the evacuation route for emergency,btohqsg
They say they heard of such fire case before happening to other poly,btohqsg
Speak of emergency evacuation   my friend read up an article and told me about this dude who threatened to shoot ppl in school  his motive is to trigger a lockdown so that exams are cancelled. Yes   it happened in America,btohqsg
He used tor to hide his identity but he gt arrested upon investigation,btohqsg
Maybe soon I will become AI and contribute to the spam,btohqsg
Well AI getting sophisticated and their use proliferation is also a factor,btohqsg
Soo scared of my o level o/n series My bio and chem was good but add math and math d was a blunder my answers werent correct but i talked with my teachers they said if my answers were wrong but the steps are correct and what so ever decent approach i might pass with a 30percent on both add math and math d i hope i atleast get an E cuz i was never good at math,btohqsg
Math is considered grindable by most students,btohqsg
I have friends that cannot get math no matter how much you teach them,btohqsg
Even getting c6 is considered a miracle,btohqsg
Try the grail and seek notes ?,btohqsg
I used to fail Math 😂😂,btohqsg
I have a unique case here   my school offers o levels Math to my class while it is not express class,btohqsg
Some even applied for other subjects,btohqsg
That's not the point 😅😅 I used to keep falling math common test/exam,btohqsg
Until I gt n level results it was A and o levels Mathematics results it was c5 in fact 😅😅,btohqsg
there is no A for N level its just grade 1 2 3 4 5.... i think,btohqsg
Uhh that was many years ago 😅😅,btohqsg
My parents do pay for Math tutoring svc   if that info helps 😅😅,btohqsg
Guys iw give tuition how do I go ab it man :/,btohqsg
You want money or uni portfolio?,btohqsg
I miss having a patient teacher,btohqsg
Anyways  so how do I go ab it,btohqsg
If you want a way to answer the questionDescribe one way in which you have contributed to your community  whether in your family  the classroom  your neighborhood  etc.(MIT Admissions)then I'd recommend volunteeringOtherwise  you could find platforms to advertise/offer tuition (paid tuition). Do find a particular subject you plan to teach  and look for students!,btohqsg
I’ve been looking through agencies since before alevels 😫,btohqsg
https://www.giving.sg/volunteer/opportunity/volunteer-with-campusimpact-An example. Can search viagiving.sgif you haven’t tried there,btohqsg
Welcome. You can use search words like “education” or “youth” to help you narrow the resultsI usegiving.sgto help me find causes to donate to and to volunteer 👍🏽,btohqsg
you might also conisder volunteering for your MP's Meet The Peoples Session,btohqsg
Should be more scared for english instead,btohqsg
Is ok some of us in physics hate physics too,btohqsg
Physics used to be my favourite in sec sch lol,btohqsg
Chemistry and Physics was my favorite in sec sch.,btohqsg
Until A lvl organic chem happened,btohqsg
I doing IT course in Poly uh,btohqsg
Ppl say chemistry is actually very complicated physics   true to some extent,btohqsg
why did i sign myself up for this,btohqsg
I heard the China version of a level (they also got sciences and arts stream too) their chemistry is as tough too,btohqsg
hot take: i personally would prefer having something like gaokao in sg,btohqsg
Think Chinese students who experience gaokao see a levels as similar difficulty,btohqsg
Provided the papers are translated properly 😅😅,btohqsg
One thing I probably won't like about Gaokao and Korean CSAT is the fact that you have to finish whole set in 8 to 9 hours,btohqsg
gaokao is 100× harder than the a levels,btohqsg
My o levels was suppose to test organic chem  covid took that topic out,btohqsg
Paper went from 80 marks to 60 marks after the common last topic was taken out,btohqsg
Oh the last common topics thingymabob,btohqsg
Yes for physics it was magnetism,btohqsg
Yea o level organic was easier to memorise,btohqsg
For maths it was probability I think,btohqsg
No because what is the pt,btohqsg
Because of this some jc students didn't study vector in o level e Math,btohqsg
And had to study basics at a levels instead,btohqsg
Yea imagine me being a n level student whom alr had common last topic taken out then go onto o levels and same thing happens,btohqsg
He would've done better in gaokao than o level,btohqsg
Thanks for enlightening me randkmdkd  I couldnt have arrived at that conclusion without you 💚,btohqsg
No problem I hope that u getting nett 6 for o levels made u happy,btohqsg
But I didnt take o levels  😡 this is erasure and you are not Holding Space for me 😭,btohqsg
Omg are u a RI IP STUDENT,btohqsg
No  I signed on after PSLE to serve our nation 🇸🇬🇸🇬🇸🇬,btohqsg
Well I have friends who are home schooled 😅😅,btohqsg
No surprises as I know all kinds of family dynamics 👍 seen enough,btohqsg
I thought the minimum age to serve military is 16.5 right?,btohqsg
So if sec school students drop out they serve at 16 ?,btohqsg
I never seen this before tough,btohqsg
But at 16  not much guys would like to do that,btohqsg
Some countries laws are strange like US   you are allowed to serve military at 18 but only allowed intoxicants like alcohol at 21 if not wrong,btohqsg
Is like saying ppl can sacrifice their life for country at 18 but drinking they set at 21,btohqsg
Singapore you are allowed to serve military at 18 but only allowed to vote at 21,btohqsg
Is like saying ppl can sacrifice their life for country at 18 but voting they set at 21,btohqsg
Which I would argue military is more dangerous than alcohol yeah,btohqsg
True but also not the youngest age possible tbh,btohqsg
16.5 is apparently the legal age to enter NS,btohqsg
We cant even smoke ciggs at 18,btohqsg
Wyatt What happened to your profile photo? 😁,btohqsg
Can we ask home work questions here or no,btohqsg
See the relevant O Level and A Level chats,btohqsg
Is there a uni chat group?,btohqsg
Think can join a level chat group .... some universities topic overlap with a levels and Poly Math,btohqsg
A levels doesn’t have Multivariate calc,btohqsg
What MV calc are you talking about anywayd,btohqsg
Oh okay does anyone have the a level group,btohqsg
Can I send the pic here,btohqsg
I have to find 4 stationary points but I can only find 2,btohqsg
Lowkey I think the teacher assumed a symmetrical case but didnt realised y=z so they’re equivalent points,btohqsg
did you get up to here,btohqsg
I’ll send my working let me just write out on paper properly,btohqsg
I equated x² + y² + z² = x + y + z = 1,btohqsg
we need some g(x) = 0,btohqsg
Oh I just used two Multivariate constraint functions,btohqsg
I can only find two pts ,btohqsg
I got the constraint y = z,btohqsg
But at the end I could only find 2 pts that fulfilled the conditions,btohqsg
I found my Lagrange multiplier to be λ = -1,btohqsg
Do we have to find it tho,btohqsg
but i just found it somehow,btohqsg
Yeah I just used one to simplify my work,btohqsg
You’re taking fmath or are u in uni?,btohqsg
Just got my O Level results,btohqsg
Brother why are u doing Multivariate calc in sec sch,btohqsg
I want to maximize the area of my Minecraft farm,btohqsg
We need more people like you in math degrees,btohqsg
why would you need lagrange multipliers for that lol,btohqsg
surely there are easier ways to do it,btohqsg
yeah i could AM-GM or somethingbut where's the fun in that?,btohqsg
Maybe he wants to maximise it with the constraint of the amount of wood he has to build fences,btohqsg
Sounds a bit overkill but no judgement here,btohqsg
@aitkentangdoes your module cover stuff like gauss' theorem,btohqsg
That gave me ptsd i didnt need to see,btohqsg
so bro goes in ns  come out go private ..does well goes to a normal poly. all before he turns 20,btohqsg
are the laws regarding vehicles in army diff?,btohqsg
if not he could have learnt how to drive a truck before turning 19,btohqsg
Yes but not so early on,btohqsg
I doubt he can ride one... but to be far,btohqsg
Possible but probably like driving mrt train,btohqsg
By the time he ord  he would be 18 anyways haha,btohqsg
Like license only valid for driving train in certain area,btohqsg
all i know is if you serve ns  you dont need to wait 1yr between car to truck like normal civs do,btohqsg
Just like pilot license has limits too,btohqsg
I’m doing a stats degree and i thought u meant the Gaussian,btohqsg
Asking if you cover stuff like vector fields  rotor and divergence etc,btohqsg
No I decided against that cause I wanna be employed in the future,btohqsg
I get the appeal tho  I’m taking some pure mods and it’s fun,btohqsg
I just don’t wanna do topology and shit,btohqsg
is one of them group theory,btohqsg
i could go on for hours about algebra,btohqsg
No im doing analysis this year,btohqsg
Planning to do real and complex analysis next year,btohqsg
U know in uni they have analysis 1 and 2 before u start a dedicated real analysis mod,btohqsg
Yeah but as a stats major u kinda gotta be Goated at real so u can do measure theory in y3 or 4,btohqsg
Planning to do mathematical stats as a masters cause I wanna get behind the theory and proofs,btohqsg
I have a bookStatistical Inferenceby Casella and Berger,btohqsg
Oh yes I heard that this one is really good,btohqsg
Gives a decently rigorous treatment  introducing Komolgorov's Axioms,btohqsg
It is one of the best out there,btohqsg
Are u planning on doing pure?,btohqsg
For abstract algebra  I am reading Aluffi,btohqsg
Yeah  double major Math + CS,btohqsg
But I didn't know the two could do quant,btohqsg
Just that all the math+ cs ppl I know are going for quant,btohqsg
originally planned to enter teaching but now quant is appealing,btohqsg
Yeah I mean anywhere which gives u so much money to do what u love is appealing,btohqsg
Wanted to be a prof at first but then I saw all the bs my profs had to deal with when I entered uni and decided against it,btohqsg
i actually have a few programming projects and my portfolio  if you wanna see it,btohqsg
Lowkey have no idea what I wanna do,btohqsg
Do u have to pay for that,btohqsg
I have to pay stuff to maintain my projecthttps://lib.gsn.bz,btohqsg
Wait this is actually kinda crazy,btohqsg
Are u planning to study in sg,btohqsg
Cause if u wanna do math academia as a path isn’t it kinda dead here,btohqsg
Wat to eat at suntec lpl,btohqsg
U sound like a future mathmos,btohqsg
I have a friend who drop out of ite and went ns straight   he came out   join another ite course and now in studying diploma. I have seen all kind of studying dynamics in my life.,btohqsg
So I dw to judge ppl for how they plan life in school,btohqsg
Studying UG material since p2 .,btohqsg
The only leftover to be concerned about is how they study ... afterall everyone wants decent grades for money they put in studying,btohqsg
I am not a prodigyJust someone who kinda likes math and cs,btohqsg
You should've gone to NUSH  your interests will flourish there,btohqsg
Ye and some uni math and CS course too,btohqsg
Shame I can only self study,btohqsg
but to me  that's the joy of learning,btohqsg
Try study using MOOC by MIT and Stanford,btohqsg
I know someone online describing their courses : they finish the equivalent of o level in first 2 to 3 years,btohqsg
I do watch Physics lectures by Prof. Lewin,btohqsg
found them to be very helpful,btohqsg
I'm using this method to study AI .,btohqsg
although I don't plan to take Physics haha,btohqsg
Ah ye  MIT profs are V good,btohqsg
Cs229Cs230Cs231nThese courses by Stanford for AI.,btohqsg
Quite math heavy too for Cs229.,btohqsg
For MIT it's mostly stats  and DSA.,btohqsg
andrew ng is a good prof,btohqsg
i think i should start indexing some of these mooc for others.,btohqsg
Wait I’m looking through this more now and it’s actually insane as hell,btohqsg
Please do maths man  you’re the kinda guy who gets a theorem named after him,btohqsg
yall what math tuition yall recommend? the ones im looking at 600$ per month bruh idh that kinda money,btohqsg
thank you so much!i just make these because I believe that education should be free,btohqsg
hopefully i did my part if anyone finds the stuff inside useful to them :),btohqsg
Saw this on Red Note lol. for this guy to see face to face with NEA agent. really suay lol.,btohqsg
H2 Maths? Just go find free lectures on Vimeo lol,btohqsg
pretty sure SAJC and VJC have tons of old syllabus one from 2010-2016.,btohqsg
Do you need tuition exactly  or guidebook?,btohqsg
im in secondary sch lol 😢 i find in person more helpful so im looking for tuition centre,btohqsg
straight f9 kid  locked in for Os c5 but im not happy with it  doing private candidate,btohqsg
idk sia 4 sessions a month,btohqsg
oh. what help you need? E Maths only?,btohqsg
Tuition center cant guarantee all the chers are good tho,btohqsg
idk if i shld take a math privately and do tuition & mug much harder so i can get into a better JC,btohqsg
whats the rate for one session,btohqsg
ill look into that  not bad price ‼️,btohqsg
I rmb they had like surge pricing when i went during psle,btohqsg
i forgot which one was the 600$ i think its the learning lab a and e math,btohqsg
if u can go into JC  don't bother retake O lvl,btohqsg
i got screwed over with 3 B3s bruh,btohqsg
wah so long since I last came this grp,btohqsg
YIJC h2 math pre req is a2 e math tho 🥲🥲  and i EAEed successfully to poly (i regret my course) so i appealing to JC,btohqsg
didnt take a maths in sch,btohqsg
Actually more important question is What you want to progress in your career in life,btohqsg
and what's the suitable / alternative pathway to reach there.,btohqsg
not everything must die die come out from school with a Cert / Degree.,btohqsg
what course? Poly is also ok,btohqsg
i rlly want a chemistry degree  ik my poly course can make it there but GPA being cumulative is like damn.. i can barely fuck up,btohqsg
I mean jc oso need keep up,btohqsg
it would be the same for JC,btohqsg
are the Chemical Job Prospects that good in Singapore? 🤣You really like doing Organic Chemistry?,btohqsg
ok if you got B3 for E Maths and didn't take A Maths  the chances of doing well for H2 Maths is much lower,btohqsg
i mean i dont find any other subjects interesting so 😇..😭😭,btohqsg
while I have seen it achieved before  it's going to be an uphill battle,btohqsg
yeah i have that feeling  tbf i didnt study at all for sec 2 and 3 and early sec 4..so i hope if i lock in i can do it 😭 hardest part wld be staying disciplined,btohqsg
I taught part time since 2002 after my A lvl  and full time since 2012I honestly think H2 Maths will take up a lot of your time.To take a chem degree  you would want 2 H2 sciences tooThis is a killer combo if you also didn't do too well for O lvl science,btohqsg
im still gonna take poly year 1 since i got in so 🙏🙏 get a taste of poly while retaking Os,btohqsg
i think my sci wld be ok..hopefully..,btohqsg
"most likely would be much ""Chiller"" compared to A-Levels.",btohqsg
mainly trying to grind math since i did badly for math since pri sch 😭😭🙏🙏,btohqsg
A1 for pure sciences may not even be enough for H2 sciences.,btohqsg
Dont chill umtil ur gpa can be bus fare,btohqsg
I mean if you can hire S$600/month for tuition.,btohqsg
HAHAHHAHAHA need to have enough to buy chicken rice,btohqsg
might as well just go online tuition for IGCSE Level Maths and Add Maths. lol,btohqsg
yuhh i have a part time job rn  hopefully can cover tuition fees,btohqsg
some even are self paced recorded courses,btohqsg
If i get off in 1 stop i think im chill,btohqsg
i D7 my o level maths  went to poly. one mod on maths in 3 yrs.D7 equivalent on that mod too,btohqsg
You can look for jc students who want to do some tutoring on the side after a levels. I know there are a lot  I was doing it too before uni started,btohqsg
They tend to charge cheaper fees,btohqsg
ooooooooo okey okey ill check that out,btohqsg
most likely you won't use that mod's maths in your life anytime soon lol,btohqsg
I think you have better chances going through poly to attempt uniBecause JC requires pure dedication and very strong conceptual knowledge.,btohqsg
bad idea. Syllabus changes may not be followed.,btohqsg
yea nope  it was like partial A levels kind of maths,btohqsg
This yr J2 new H2 Maths syllabusJ1 new H2 sciences syllabus,btohqsg
What did they add for math,btohqsg
Are they doing linear algebra now,btohqsg
The what G1 G2 G3 syllabus rolled in ah?,btohqsg
The maths topics i was taught in this one maths mod,btohqsg
why your notes in txt form lol,btohqsg
return of y² = f(x) curves from pre 2017,btohqsg
the physics spreadsheet thing is interesting,btohqsg
Honestly this is probably for the best ,btohqsg
idk what that’s about exactly actually,btohqsg
I find it an essential topic to teach,btohqsg
but I'm still re reading infinite square potential well for the new syllabus,btohqsg
oh yea this is wild but i like it lmao,btohqsg
Isn’t h2 math a preparation of the math that most degrees will use in uni?,btohqsg
What are the uses of complex outside of eee and some niche physics,btohqsg
"True  but I think polar form will actually ""complete"" the learning",btohqsg
don't think h2 needs complex numbers for the analysis.,btohqsg
I agree too but for most ppl it isn’t super duper relevant,btohqsg
wait do students need to know what a wavefunction is idr,btohqsg
It’s kinda like how I think they should teach analysis in jc to get a complete view of calc but it wouldn’t be relevant to most,btohqsg
complex analysis is a completely different ballgame than polar form,btohqsg
It's always about training the analytical skills and not just the technical skills,btohqsg
I don't see the Excel parts lol,btohqsg
for eg I send my kids to art classes not for them to excel in art,btohqsg
real analysis isformalizationof calculus to me,btohqsg
Agreed but can’t tht be trained in other ways while also tackling the former? More efficient that way no?,btohqsg
it was just some memorisation notes,btohqsg
Yeah in a way wouldn’t that “complete” it  idk,btohqsg
not niche physics btw just physics as a whole at uni level has quite a lot of it,btohqsg
Oh like for heat and shit?,btohqsg
Economics will not have polar form,btohqsg
Economics is complex enoughNo need complex numbers,btohqsg
I have a friend who specializes in HEP & QM,btohqsg
I see a lot of polar form and stuff in his work,btohqsg
i say that because specialising in QM is like saying i specialise in calculus,btohqsg
it’s a fundamental part of it,btohqsg
ahhh  what's the Spreadsheet/Excel things about in the Paper 4 ah?I don't see anything out of the norm.Seems like regular data collection from Practical?,btohqsg
well he mainly does HEP is what I can say,btohqsg
Wait didn’t u just finish Os how are u meeting these ppl wtf,btohqsg
don't fully understand why they need it yet  when GC can replicate,btohqsg
what a waste. Easiest to score,btohqsg
I systemised my methods + finished up 120 pages of self study examples.This year J2s final year to use 😭,btohqsg
just write rebrand the book and sell it for the International Syllabus lol,btohqsg
We still have Paper 5 Planning. lel,btohqsg
different. International one is much easier,btohqsg
got reference better than nothing la haha,btohqsg
then need to rewrite it also,btohqsg
"It says ""may"" means not really technically required also lol.",btohqsg
The exam paper now looks like Cambridge International exam paper,btohqsg
"got ""instructions"" and ""info. to candidates""",btohqsg
Most of SEAB papers are Colabs with Cambridge throughout 2000s.When Singapore using their own syllabus.I always find the papers nearly identical 🤣,btohqsg
just that Singapore ones tends to kills more brain cells when answering.,btohqsg
This part (v) you know how to answer already? haha,btohqsg
for the (v) - to support your relationship in (iii)Most likely you found your percentage uncertainty.Then  comment like the greenbox saying it is less than 10% to 20% percentage uncertainty. Then free 1 mark 🤣,btohqsg
yes  very standard question every year,btohqsg
I see. This I have no clue about since I don't have access to purchase the Practical paper. 🤣,btohqsg
the TYS always the basic MCQ + Structures only.,btohqsg
The jump from e math to h2 math would be very high,btohqsg
needs atleast basics H1 Maths or something more relevant to art stream field,btohqsg
I dont even feel like e math is relevant at all,btohqsg
Might as well be learning an entirely new subject (thats how i felt from e math to h2 math),btohqsg
E math is super basic math . H2 math is mainly building up the foundation for uni type of math,btohqsg
AMath is more related to H2 math but it's not by a long shot,btohqsg
If you take H2 math   prepare to work super duper hard on chapters esp calculus,btohqsg
It's f*** difficult for a beginner,btohqsg
different people really struggle with different parts for h2 math,btohqsg
calculus was my fav part lmao,btohqsg
im a jack of all trade,btohqsg
Omg i cant sleep what is wrong with me,btohqsg
damn you didnt have to do him like that,btohqsg
I used to volunteer as an editor for materials and distribute them on fb.... there is this post of fb about a female student in jc taking h2 Math with no add Math knowledge,btohqsg
She actually failed her exam 😥and apparently the teacher lost patience and ask her to drop h2 Math,btohqsg
If I am not wrong some jcs do have like  A Maths revision packages to revise A maths concepts,btohqsg
Think should have but for her case I really unsure if it helped 😅😅 I would say depends on the student really. In my Poly course same issue uh,btohqsg
Students in Applied Science   Engineering and ICT/IT faculties have poor stats of passing Math module on first try,btohqsg
If they don't have add Math background,btohqsg
This gets problematic that the school have bridging crash courses to prepare students for Math,btohqsg
never struggled with maths until uni 2nd semester where I wasn't listening in lecture  and as a result scored A-2nd worst ever maths score😔,btohqsg
i never struggled bc when i didn’t do well,btohqsg
had 1 student years ago like this  but for H1 Maths  so can't drop.Then she came to me  and suddenly passed for the first time.Then she told me her teacher said she 起死回身,btohqsg
complex analysis kicked my ass back then,btohqsg
i found it a fun field to study,btohqsg
it was so easy it doesn't even feel like a flex,btohqsg
i never said i didn’t enjoy the content,btohqsg
I only see how many actually struggled with it when I started teaching,btohqsg
anyway the last time i touched math outside of the context of physics was in undergrad so,btohqsg
Ah no wonderDid you take FM,btohqsg
it was called C Maths then,btohqsg
is it the standard proving  inequalities and number theory?,btohqsg
mechanics was in Maths. Best for me,btohqsg
orh that was in the international a level curriculum,btohqsg
seab forces us to take stats unfortunately,btohqsg
stats would make me score lower,btohqsg
I would much prefer pure math,btohqsg
like i can’t rmb much about a level stats lol,btohqsg
FM had 5 mechanics and 5 stats and we had to choose 7,btohqsg
You did all 5 mech qns?,btohqsg
naturally 5 mechanics 2 statsbut that caused me to only hit 87% in prelims,btohqsg
now i have to study stats ...,btohqsg
isn’t stats in a levels pretty procedural anyway,btohqsg
my stats was weaker cuz I wasn't in sch,btohqsg
i mean the entirety of h2 math can be grinded to an A,btohqsg
I only remember A level time haha,btohqsg
the rest of schooling days before that were a whirl,btohqsg
i rmb helping someone with TMUA and h2 really does not train them for smth more logic based,btohqsg
esp if they scored by just grinding,btohqsg
I realised a lot of maths understanding starts from pri sch,btohqsg
yea the tmua paper 2 has a ton of logical reasoning needed,btohqsg
tmua is mainly used for people that wanna major in things like econs or cs in oxbridge/imperial etc,btohqsg
so it’s more on the reasoning aspect,btohqsg
iirc it's used for math offers from Cambridge,btohqsg
a lot more mathematically tedious like if you compare the two,btohqsg
tmua often doesn’t expect a ton of full calculations but you need to have the reasoning to deduce things,btohqsg
step is full calculations and showing things,btohqsg
a lot of proofs and stuff in 2024's paper,btohqsg
yup also tmua is all MCQ which seems easier but it’s really not,btohqsg
you still have to work out the answers?,btohqsg
bc some questions can have like 8 options and they’re very good at making you feel confident in picking a wrong ans,btohqsg
for example they might give you a potential proof to a simple statement and ask if there’s errors and which line has it,btohqsg
ah  spotting the flaw in a proof,btohqsg
yup or say given a certain statement is true  which of the following must be necessary and/or sufficient,btohqsg
it helps to be very good at visualisation,btohqsg
hi guys  i am sending something that may help sec school students if they are facing issues with notes and resources in school. please help support this student initiative 🙏😄,btohqsg
follow deoxyfication on IG for more info,btohqsg
Why is Holygrail mentioned in this group? 😁,btohqsg
Title: Confused About DMA Restrictions: Why Is Holy Grail Blocked but Not Netflix or Spotify?#Rant😡ID:#CE85DAFQ---Why does the DMA block holy grail but not netflix or Spotify 😭😭 all the notes websites are banned for my school I don't get it bruh  anyone else school is the same?---Postconfession!📩CHAT WITHconfessor!💬,btohqsg
Wait school ban holy grail ?,btohqsg
But ... why ? Grail is like one stop for materials that students can use,btohqsg
Actually you can get around it I think but need to be creative,btohqsg
Like there are many sophisticated ways to bypass,btohqsg
If you want access grail on pld can use a proxy browser,btohqsg
Note and disclaimer: I not trying to teach illegal uses of such techniques and please use then responsibly,btohqsg
Another way is a bit sophisticated  can rent a vm in cloud,btohqsg
The vm specs must be windows server or equivalent,btohqsg
U siao ahWho want pay $5+ per month to run a VM (probably Linux),btohqsg
Pld can run .exe file meh,btohqsg
At least mobile guardian chromebook cannot,btohqsg
My bro could not even down zoom when he had his pld,btohqsg
Some remote desktop kit got Web interface,btohqsg
But * issue is logmein need pay $$,btohqsg
So you need find free svc,btohqsg
lai lai wna gamble during cny just do at home,btohqsg
Once you know how to play vm can manipulate it to run vpn server,btohqsg
Gambling a strange game where the winning move is not play 😂😂😄,btohqsg
to be fair  i think the new DMA that took over Mobile Guardian is still not so developed,btohqsg
my sec sch DMA was a nightmare during class,btohqsg
i was always envious of the schools who had Mobile Guardian set up  until all this cyber attacks in 2024meanwhile  students* who always had to use blocksi,btohqsg
Meanwhile   there are ppl who use cloud svc to bypass DMA apps,btohqsg
Like using offshore cloud svc to view things,btohqsg
While in certain case is justified   some ppl use cloud svc to view stuff they not supposed to see,btohqsg
Me if I have a use case.,btohqsg
If I use it   I'll gladly pay for it,btohqsg
Somehow I can do C++ better while making custom Android ROMs than my coursework 😭,btohqsg
But then Poly network filter not that strict tbh,btohqsg
I seen ppl playing agar io,btohqsg
huh how ? my sch used mobile guardian last time,btohqsg
This is not allowed in sec and pri sch  network,btohqsg
I have my own homemade mini server,btohqsg
You run RD server or vpn server  on it ? 🤔,btohqsg
If so if your device allows only browser   can pre install Web interface based RD app too 😂😂 just that the computing power is your own and you can access blocked learning content in school,btohqsg
Well many years ago I coached my friend's younger brother on how to run Minecraft server on his own computer before,btohqsg
Taught him how to configure his router and stuff,btohqsg
bro someone hacked my sch emails and started sending racist shit and porn links in my school google classrooms,btohqsg
right after installing new dma also,btohqsg
2 yrs ago   someone hacked into one of the student's email in my school and started sending fake love letters targeted towards a girl in that person's class..then not long later  a person accused of rpe was called out the same way through the same email that was sent to everyone,btohqsg
which fella apply to poly computing so free one bro,btohqsg
this year is so cooked my o level year,btohqsg
bro the dma like delete our goodnotes and shi,btohqsg
u nvr report to ur cher?,btohqsg
bro they send in the google classroom all the chers can see,btohqsg
thats why i dont keep my notes digitally,btohqsg
actually bro my holy grail nomore,btohqsg
plus new policy no phones so cannot send to ipad,btohqsg
same  mine was sent to multiple cohorts,btohqsg
bro my one also android got hacked and locked but ios like ntg,btohqsg
cos they signed into sch email on phone,btohqsg
LOL how did y'all emails get hacked,btohqsg
does the school not enforce 2fa,btohqsg
my school new tertiary education juvenile rehab centre🙏,btohqsg
Got one dude email mass email to thousands of students,btohqsg
Turned out his email account gt hacked,btohqsg
And the email has malware site link,btohqsg
Then my Poly email system got misused too by students one year after the incident where some people mass mail survey links to other students to run projects,btohqsg
The email svc uses an office 365 system gt a feature that was misused,btohqsg
After that ppl within the school misused the Distribution group address to create user account on adult only sites (NSFW sites🔞) 😅😅,btohqsg
Resulting in thousands of students receiving information on how to activate adult site user account!,btohqsg
punggol sec used a different DMA that's called blocksi so it might have been different for others,btohqsg
blocksi i rmbr all the sites & applications damn hard to get thru,btohqsg
i was from the batch bfr (2023),btohqsg
You cannot take combined and pure bio simultaneously,btohqsg
selecting electives or subject combinations is a headache,btohqsg
academically i qualify as a candidate,btohqsg
iirc usually i see sg they refer these students as smth else,btohqsg
portfolio in generalgrades  social life & general development,btohqsg
Hi guys  I’m bored during my holidays and starting jc in feb. I’m normally really slow and I think starting to study now seems best for me. does anyone know any good online material I can refer to for H2 math or chem,btohqsg
You'll have to create an account outside of the US,btohqsg
idk if it's true but some social media are implementing measures like what china has been doing for their social platforms,btohqsg
basically exposing the city / country of where people have posted  from,btohqsg
Vpn to create an account outside of the US ?,btohqsg
You study in US uh ?,btohqsg
Think can use vpn out of us control,btohqsg
They block vpn too ? 😅,btohqsg
a vpn doesn't just mean you're suddenly not from the us or that your account isn't linked to the us,btohqsg
So any account previously in USA gets blocked too ?,btohqsg
potentially. some people have experienced the block despite not even being from there,btohqsg
What the US did is basically what india has done to over 50 apps when they banned tiktok,btohqsg
apparently u can get charged if u use vpn,btohqsg
Till date india has banned 220 apps in the last 5 years  alot of chinese linked apps,btohqsg
When titkok was banned in india  they issued a appstore/gamestore wide banned on these apps as well,btohqsg
Is there any information that tiktok might want to host a web hidden service ? Facebook has a tor hidden service ....,btohqsg
xhs  weibo  a lot of social media used in china has this feature,btohqsg
dark web is banned in china,btohqsg
This gonna create a lot of problems for ppl with tik tok acc,btohqsg
Nah I use have my US SIM card in here on standby,btohqsg
So on roaming uh while using usa sim card ?,btohqsg
it alr has for those like influencers,btohqsg
"pov : chinese netizens roast the ""migrators"" in the comment section",btohqsg
they come to xhs as tik tok refugees,btohqsg
and the ppl who migrate over can't understand the comment sections,btohqsg
my xhs flooded with tik tok refugees feed 💀,btohqsg
worse is some of them become racist on the app,btohqsg
i just click ignore / remove the ENGLISH ONLY posts,btohqsg
that means they're out of my algorithm,btohqsg
i don't mind those that add both english & chinese subtitles,btohqsg
essentially  a TikTok that's even more Chinese,btohqsg
"Funnily enough the justification for TikTok's ban was its ""links to China"".",btohqsg
Yet people are moving to certain apps despite their much stronger relations to China,btohqsg
Xhs official English name is red note,btohqsg
oh yea btw apparently  its not only the US and the ban may spread to other US allies but unlikely tho,btohqsg
tiktok ban is a western thing,btohqsg
yea  india's one was more than just tiktok tho..they had physical conflicts with chinese personell..that could have contributed to it,btohqsg
they ban tiktok but not guns????,btohqsg
i never understood what the US actually means..when they create these vehicles for china,btohqsg
USA gun law is limited by constitution btw,btohqsg
well now trump says hes gonna save tiktok,btohqsg
when he was all on banning it in the first place,btohqsg
all the tariffs on china..and yet here they are creating authoritrative vehicles for china...like they are playing both sides of a coin,btohqsg
The reason why their gun law is so ridiculously relaxed is to do with historical reason,btohqsg
if you look at trends  after every mass shooting. more gun laws which enables more people to get guns are put into effect than laws preventing more guns,btohqsg
Yup coz prevent guns requirements constitutional ammendments and US constitutional structure is very difficult to change,btohqsg
You have to understand that lobby groups are in power too and USA was founded in 1776   back then US relied on militia to run their war machinery   hence they granted gun rights to ppl at constitutional level,btohqsg
This seems outdated as since then,btohqsg
US already have an army already,btohqsg
the Us is one of those pandora box's ahh country,btohqsg
remove the army again then 😁,btohqsg
you say US Allies so i thought Singapore too,btohqsg
Officially   Singapore is no country's ally,btohqsg
But we get military stuff from mostly US though 😅😅😅,btohqsg
Our F15 and F16 aircraft came from there,btohqsg
Something like how swiss operate with neutrality  in fact the Swiss has military equipment from Western countries too.,btohqsg
Like their F/A 18 jets come from US too,btohqsg
Countries have to side with each other lol,btohqsg
They just become desperate during emergencies and wartimes.,btohqsg
Guys I want ask if there are IB students or alumni here,btohqsg
I don't understand how the IB subject combi system works,btohqsg
idk how ppl always analyse the same logic for every situations,btohqsg
referring to taking a neutral stance,btohqsg
like they don't consider the bigger picture or specific context,btohqsg
Singapore is taking its own side . Aka : it is taking a position which is in its best interests.,btohqsg
i get so shocked by some of the comments by keyboard warriors online,btohqsg
getting influenced by PR tactics & propaganda tensions made by literally media everywhere,btohqsg
First of all   I'm just curious how old you are ?,btohqsg
im 19 this yr  i can't see eye to eye with all the ppl my age,btohqsg
like umm i would say there's a gap,btohqsg
True it's PR but let's imagine if you are a country's president . What will you do ? And there's a war happening in EUROPE which does not concern you . What will you do ?,btohqsg
im 20 turning 21 and i cant even catch the ideals of people my age either...like half of them are trend hoppers...they dont actually know the context behind any of the trends,btohqsg
So then what do you think is happening? Since I see you have your own opinions,btohqsg
With regards to SG position .,btohqsg
This is actually said by some minister.Don't quote me on thisYou can think I'm bullshitting or whatever,btohqsg
i'll have to consider the bigger picture  even if I get seen as a villain,btohqsg
like the country's ability to sustain in the long term of THE CURRENT era,btohqsg
So in who's interests will you take to make this decision ?,btohqsg
but it's never easy to make things smooth flowing,btohqsg
wait this topic might be a bit too political,btohqsg
there's a limit to politics talk here,btohqsg
so it’s more on the reasoning aspect,btohqsg
Yeah my sch I studied in only allow black or white shoes 😅😅 that was a decade ago,btohqsg
i think jc doesn't really care?,btohqsg
the worry is you getting bullied,btohqsg
she clock me last time for another pair of shoes,btohqsg
ok but like tht was in y3,btohqsg
i asked my mom she said senior high alr fcp dgaf,btohqsg
but that day i saw her scolding some jh boys for haircut or smth,btohqsg
My school okay with black shoes as long as is not some outrageous colour,btohqsg
Hair wise they not okay with outrageous colours too such as unnatural hair being put pink or red,btohqsg
i know ppl think black covered shoes = ANY DESIGN,btohqsg
"they ignore the part of ""PLAIN"" BLACK/WHITE colour shoes only",btohqsg
Yup coz they know sometimes we need black shoes for certain purposes so yeah,btohqsg
