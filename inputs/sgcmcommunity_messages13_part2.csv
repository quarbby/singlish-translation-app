You care do a comparison like this when there isn't available option.But there is super fast charging Huawei power bank ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yes  i know. Provided the places u go to have ev charging and also its not taken,btohqsg
why bother to let them dismantle and install batteries. the more often this is done the more problems car will get,btohqsg
Already having ev cars got privileges like handicap lots liao. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
i am betting it wont work outside china. wont do well,btohqsg
we can see how far NIO gets in europe,btohqsg
Limited lots usually 2.. and i always see they r taken,btohqsg
Hdb the places i go all no ev lots. Rarely some places got bluesg parking can charge for awhile,btohqsg
Will be interesting to see how authorities will impose penalties on those hogging spaces,btohqsg
They want to impose penalties for those not charging but parked at those lots,btohqsg
Yea. It takes time.. even so the penalty is affordable,btohqsg
The rich will take it as priority fee parking lol,btohqsg
Similar to penalties like not putting parking coupons? ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Cos ev lot usually nearer to mall entrance,btohqsg
And they dun have to shift their car to somewhere far,btohqsg
Cheating is a privilege for the rich. ðŸ˜… cause can save if donâ€™t get caught.,btohqsg
First 5 min - 10%Next 5min - 30min 15%30min - 20%1hr - 50%Hahah will this deter them,btohqsg
i am betting charging times get better as we speak and swapping becomes redundant,btohqsg
How to catch? Wheel clamps better.,btohqsg
Lol maybe for the cheaper EV but if they driving Porsche Taycan S then no  it won't deter them,btohqsg
Gov need revenue  time to impose absd on car ownerships.,btohqsg
The system/app will notify when fully charge. And it will increase the cost as time goes by. So they have to unplug and move out..,btohqsg
They charge at home. Wun bother charging n snatching lot with commoners unless they wan to park near entrance,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s brilliant if full charging status also prompt owners.,btohqsg
They will want to park near entrance... Just treat it as super premium parking lol. Should build EV lots far away from entrance then won't have hoggers. Same problem with family lots... So near entrance  sometimes see people park there alone  confirm no family cos see them come alone  leave alone,btohqsg
Same as for handicap lots? Sure got parking space for them anyway.,btohqsg
Y ev need have lots near entrance.. they handicap meh lol,btohqsg
Handicap need the short distance cos they are not able bodied..so it makes sense..but EV no need ma,btohqsg
Does autopilot makes u look like handicap ? The real deal is manual cars. Non Handicap,btohqsg
Manual car shld have special lots near entrance,btohqsg
Cos of all the left leg footwork makes them tired n sore,btohqsg
Handicap is for Golfers so i think those park near entrance with such entitlement is mostly Golfers?,btohqsg
They deserve to walk lesser to enter mall. Hahaha ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ya traffic conditions here esp with hoggers... Left leg confirm very strong and tired,btohqsg
Left leg strong with right hand strong,btohqsg
How to ensure vehicles that has been charged be moved off by their owner promptly? Chances are they can heck care and come back whenever they like right? Any EV owner can share your personal experience?,btohqsg
Got charge for hogging time de,btohqsg
Orchard Central has charging station for Tesla right at level 9,btohqsg
Impose financial penalties lor. Once charged full in status  the app should be able to impose more cost.,btohqsg
Something like renting bluesg until it get return to a station,btohqsg
Lots of places now starting to clamp,btohqsg
Pretty Singaporean way of resolving things yah? Just fine to comply. Hee Hee,btohqsg
First thing when entering a npark is the board of fines,btohqsg
U see our drivers driving etiquette  donâ€™t give way   donâ€™t signal what more u expect them to move for ev hahahahha,btohqsg
Once you clamp the car  wouldnâ€™t it be worst? Weâ€™ve seen cases where owner refuse to pay and refuse to move their car. Bring more problems to security and MCST.,btohqsg
Got see before mcst said u delay then pay more parking fees lol,btohqsg
Clamping if they damage or scratch ur expensive rims  another set of drama,btohqsg
If not happy beat security then call police lol,btohqsg
I donâ€™t see a problem with mcst unless they want to be in the news,btohqsg
All ev charging got app one right,btohqsg
