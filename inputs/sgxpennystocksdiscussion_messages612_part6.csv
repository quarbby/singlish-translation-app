Chinese Tech Stocks Drop to New Crackdown Lows  Led by Alibaba1. The Hang Seng Tech Index fell as much as 3.1% on Tuesday  on course for its lowest close since inception in July 2020. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. led declines following a Bloomberg report that authorities are kicking off another round of checks on its fintech business arm.2. The rout weighed on the broader Hong Kong market  with the Hang Seng Index slipping as much as 3.5%  the most since September. The weakness also comes as global equities face pressure from escalating tensions in Ukraine.3. Investor concern is mounting that a new wave of crackdowns could be in the pipeline for the sector.
