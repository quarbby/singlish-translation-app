There is no such thing as don‚Äôt worry  job complete collect money. No need to worries about customer service  if he or she sincerely to pay they will do on the spot if not fxxktard customer.. you let or trust is ur own decision.. don‚Äôt complain if they don‚Äôt payü§£üòÇ,btohqsg
Since you didn‚Äôt collect payment now  straight to the Dropoff point again and call for police assistance,btohqsg
Next time tell ur customers to place $1000 deposit on ur account when they need ur service you will come for to see whether and their reaction on you and they Might complain you to Llm or whatever applicant you are on.. don‚Äôt be stupid to what it may affects you,btohqsg
But you already asking for ideas and complaining.. why made yourself so difficult and not in peace and think whether what to say if they unwilling to pay on the spot. If this kind of case happens to me it‚Äôs a chicken fleet .. I am special train to deal with ppls with this kind of attitude üëç,btohqsg
This is obviously something to do with ur character  you afraid this afraid that  like that how to works and create ur own business if you have a chance.. ever if you work for others you mindset never chance you will never succeed ü§£,btohqsg
We work for money nothing else but just money.. especially in Singapore ever our Govt love money more than us the citizen of Singapore üá∏üá¨üòÇü§£,btohqsg

Letting go my micheline tyre ? 195/ 65/15. Mileage 3-4k300 for set of 4. Need to swap to ur existing tire.,btohqsg
Just say we are not allowed  company's policy. If they unable to pay cod  ask them to cancel the order. Don't take chances  you don't even know them. They not paiseh you paiseh for what? Of course talk in a nice way  they have nothing to complain.,btohqsg
Seniors can advise?These few weeks alot of oddle orders and i took a few.Mostly with a lot of tips as no drivers available.Last week take one oddle order $12 tips. (I think cause raining no drivers) Today lalamove send sms for compensation enquiry for punctuality. Use link to send form and send explanation.Take note the the order was for 11.50am pickup and 12.30pm deliveryThe order on app i take around 1pm- it was very late cause no drivers.I chiong send  1.43pm reachThey very funny? No drivers give tips then play this stunt ah. Any advise for the form reason submission ?I may not want to take oddle orders again  even if $16tipsCause they write on the notes the timing is already late,btohqsg
I nt senior  kena sms by llm Cs b4 same issue. Ask them to check what time u took the order  pickup n dropped. Some restaurants have time records of the pickups,btohqsg
This one is because you kena poked in the backside by the restaurant.,btohqsg
Next time wanna take LLM Oddle or even Kerala Eats  need to be extra careful. Coz they know that they are able to retake back the tips that they put in. Unless high demand surcharge they cannot take back. Just a little pointer for those drivers that just swipe without looking at the breakdowns.,btohqsg
This is speaking from experience coz it happened to me not once  twice or thrice. Until I‚Äôve learnt to be patient with the orders. Maybe also coz I have a full time job  so I‚Äôm not so in a hurry to take any orders.,btohqsg
Goodbye LLM. Fee total S* A,btohqsg
If want to take Oddle can  but take it when in scheduled orders. If not  this is the risk.,btohqsg
