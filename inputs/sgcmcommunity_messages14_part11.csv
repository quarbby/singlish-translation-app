Anybody knows how to change spare tire‚Ä¶.@Redhill.,btohqsg
Under such anti China sentiment propagated by U.S.  anything coming from China are no good.Chery owned Volvo now,btohqsg
I applauded your mileage clocked by a Chery. Cars are mend to be driven right? Mileage high means you have make full used of the car compared to someone‚Äôs car been park in a carpark lot somewhere.,btohqsg
Personally  I clocked in 100k within three years of the cars I bought so far.,btohqsg
Good man  sir!! üëçüèº yes no garage queens for sure! Fully support what you‚Äôre saying. For a small country like ours  we really over emphasise on mileage sometimes when the cars are built for way higher distances like overseas. What‚Äôs even more important is how the car has been maintained.,btohqsg
Yes that is the right mindset. A car is a tool. Enjoy using the tool,btohqsg
I put in about 22-25K consistently per year and every time I sell my car  they would always exclaim that its high mileage. But if you have a car at such high depreciation and don't use  what's the point! Perhaps its exactly the fact that cars are costly and that's why we Singapore drivers are consistently putting in more mileage  else its a waste to put it in the car park and take public transport.,btohqsg
Legit very impressed. Which 1990 bmw are you driving today sir. Can share the details pls? Sounds like in addition to alfa romeo  you are also bmw lover!!!! for a while I thought you were an EV owner.,btohqsg
"By the way  with all the ""false"" reporting of mileage on resale cars  what's your way of combating it when purchasing a resale car?",btohqsg
Most cars store it in the ECU,btohqsg
Can share a pic of your car front pls? I‚Äôm such a fan. I have so many questions about buying older bmw that I would love to consult you!,btohqsg
Oh. So that's a way to tell the actual mileage?,btohqsg
but as the mileage increase to like 400-500k  do expect some deviation ah because its not dead accurate,btohqsg
Thanks! Learnt something new this morning! üòÅ,btohqsg
So I guess  die die also must get the car dealer to release the car for own workshop pre-inspection,btohqsg
Haha welcome! learnt this while overseas because mileage tampering is very common elsewhere,btohqsg
haha any used car you buy  you should always do PPI. Sometimes a known to be reliable car will not be reliable if proper maintenance is not done :),btohqsg
My experience in selling my car is that   whenever I see my previous car show up in ads   the mileage will be lower even thou is already low,btohqsg
Guess its both ways to be honest. If buyers are not picky about mileage  then dealers won't have to resort to these things to tweak the mileage.,btohqsg
maybe best is to buy used ad cars,btohqsg
Haha yep. Most singaporeans correlate mileage to condition of the car which is very misleading.,btohqsg
Ah. I seldom keep track when my car is cleared off my hands. Maybe should make a mental note to follow-up and see!,btohqsg
their servicing record is more trustable,btohqsg
Yes it kinda fun and u be surprise  but so far I never see they use lady owner on me before :(,btohqsg
I have seen careful male owner beforeüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
"Haha. The ""Retired Female Teacher"" kind of text.",btohqsg
All these one female owner ads‚Ä¶. Last time in the 90s and early 2000s‚Ä¶. Used to be Malay owner,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt accept just STA cert if you can help it.,btohqsg
Sometimes they don‚Äôt allow until you pay a deposit.,btohqsg
Yes. Quite a number are like that and getting back the deposit is going to be painful.,btohqsg
Seriously  isn't there a market for a good reliable 2nd hand car dealer that does not employ all these weird grey book methods?,btohqsg
Up to one whether he or she chooses to accept it but in my mind nothing is that precious or urgent to take the risk of a major maintenance bill shortly after taking ownership of car.,btohqsg
Based on the trade-in price and the selling price  there is sufficient margin to make a living. Yes  every business is to make money but I feel  make money already also must be able to sleep at night mah.,btohqsg
Ya if they insist on deposit before allowing me to send for inspection  I‚Äôll just walk out,btohqsg
Yup‚Ä¶ always be prepared to walk away,btohqsg
Of course dealers will give you dealer job to clean up the car so everything looks pretty and clean on initial visual inspection. Nothing wrong with this as all industries do this to make sales.,btohqsg
Sick of all their tricks and football ‚öΩÔ∏è money/adminfee etc etc,btohqsg
Everyone must make a living la.. üòÉ,btohqsg
Any experience with Carro? (Sorry if its not allowed to mention specific names). I see that their cars are usually high mileage ones,btohqsg
I know but it‚Äôs just quite well‚Ä¶ I would say that it always leave a bad taste‚Ä¶ just when u thot u hd a decent deal then have this extra money slappedOn,btohqsg
Yes! Admin fee plus add-on for warranty etc.,btohqsg
So back to buyer due diligence bah.. it‚Äôs bad enough hardly any test drives are allowed for used cars.,btohqsg
Not like buying t shirt leh,btohqsg
Buyer can hardly do any due D except visual   start up‚Ä¶..test drive  for short distance w/o what deposit is a MUST,btohqsg
Wait.. even then I am not required to place deposit before trying üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
This is not accurate. That‚Äôs for very modern cars.,btohqsg
Ohhh I really thought most after say 2010 have liao,btohqsg
Many cars even in 2000s have simple mechanisms of using analogue methods,btohqsg
yeah post 1990 they can also be stored in the bcm,btohqsg
But again to be fair. There are also many ‚Äúbuyers‚Äù who call up  poke poke and test drive car for fun without actual real intention of buying too.,btohqsg
