As long as the IC not misleading its ok le... coz IC is just to identify us,btohqsg
My understanding is not put the place u own   but put the place you stay,btohqsg
Hmm. 4days condo 3 days hdb lol,btohqsg
Guys need help for hdb purchase. Due to miscomm agent telling me the seller has found a flat  I went ahead with hdb application  but now seller agent said they haven't decided yet. I already submitted the application. What can I do now?,btohqsg
Anyone has experience appealing successfully for an hdb loan rejection?Salary + bonus r slightly above the maximum and hdb rejected me.,btohqsg
does this mean the seller can only sell his flat to u at  a later date?,btohqsg
I did pay the full OTP deposit as requested though,btohqsg
so now is the seller problem. by left u may take back your deposit and do a new otp when seller ready,btohqsg
the valuation valid 3 mths only,btohqsg
This is a happy problem rightGo for bank loan instead since u are well qualified that hdb rejects you.Bank loan is less than half priced of hdb now  interest lower than 1.1%I don’t get why would pple not use bank loan  especially at the beginning where your loan is the largest amount,btohqsg
Hmm. Ok I see what they gonna do. Gt 2 agents the seller one don't know what the other doing zzz,btohqsg
Y don't go for bank loan? Hdb rates not attractive.,btohqsg
hdb loan is really super not worth it.go for bank loans  and if u are risk adverse  then ask the bank for fixed rates for as long as u can  this will be similar to your hdb rate  but at much lower price than ur hdbcongrats!,btohqsg

from a price point i guess its value add  esp on the background of rising condo prices all over SG now. But then again have to also see the condition of the reno  and whether its a right fit i guess for the intended Buyer and all,btohqsg
Just saying  am not an agent. Just my 2 cents I saw this article as well yesterday,btohqsg
Agree with youI guess also some buyers are bought into the space that’s available at the price point too,btohqsg
True that. And if borders are open with JB eventually  it is a location on close proximity there  both good and bad i guess for overall considerations.,btohqsg
