Telecom bill for revoult card award point?,btohqsg
Is it? Anyway I booked Hainan airline. And the only card that I can spend online for miles is UOB Krisflyer. I hope my transaction consider as 3mpd~,btohqsg
Hi all - saw a 8% bonus miles for citi cc when converting via kris+. Any drawback for coverting via kris+ and transferring to SIA account?,btohqsg
net 8% haircut still  but you don't need pay the $27 conversion fee,btohqsg
8% bonus after 15% haircut üòÇ,btohqsg
May check on the transfer of OA to SA?,btohqsg
Is there any minimum balance to be kept in OA before you able to transfer OA to SA?,btohqsg
Is the amount transfered from OA to SA is a reserved amount that cannot be used for CPF shielding (ie. Invest in SSB right before 55 years old)?,btohqsg
There's no such thing as SA shielding anymore.,btohqsg
If you are bellow 55 years old?,btohqsg
There is no more SA after 55 years old.No more 4% account that can be withdrawn at any time.,btohqsg
At 55  SA closes. Any investments sold will flow to RA if haven't hit FRS  or OA if already hit.,btohqsg
Question: For SA balance that was transferred from OA can it be invested?,btohqsg
You can invest. But can you find an investment that pays above 4% consistently and your capital is protected?,btohqsg
Just wanna to confirm that it can be invested.,btohqsg
Cause i tought once you transfer OA to SA  it will be reserved to form RA even before 55 years old,btohqsg
Yes  only above first 40k. The question is why? The investable products will never beat the risk free 4% p.a. that CPF is giving.,btohqsg
Usually SA balances people just leave it alone. Don‚Äôt do anything with it.,btohqsg
Only RSTU and its interests earned cannot be used for anything else other than RA.,btohqsg
If meet BHS and FRS  once reach 55 years old  any amount above BHS Ba FRS can be withdraw anytime?,btohqsg
Willnever(the better phrase is very highly unlikely) be higher. It's deliberately clamped down to only allow lower risk investments (with lower yield) to be bought.,btohqsg
BHS isnot a minimum sum  it's a limit. MA functions the same after 55. Anything in OA can be withdrawn anytime after 55.,btohqsg
Maybe you should watch Chris' CPF Ultimate guide series to understand more about the CPF accounts before attempting any actions:OA:https://t.me/HMSGHive/2040MA:https://t.me/HMSGHive/2075SA:https://t.me/HMSGHive/2112Not financial advice.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I signed up via Singsaver already and approved yesterday. Not sure if this question is asked but is this $370 cash stackable with the current Citibank promo of 40 000 ThankYou points for hitting $800 within first 2 months of approval?,btohqsg
"Hi   I cancelled my Citi bank credit card 1.5 years ago and have had no existing accounts with them since.Can anyone confirm if those Singsaver/Moneysmart Citi New-to-bank rewards are still applicable? Given that this is stated in the T&Cs""For clarity  an existing Citibank Credit Card account includes a prior applicationfor any Citibank Credit Card that has been approved by Citibank Bank even if thephysical Citibank Credit Card has not been received by the customer and/or has notbeen activated or utilized by the customer.""",btohqsg
As long within that period as stated in t&c  you have no other Citibank CC that was approved.,btohqsg
That quoted T&C seems like something that was added recently. If my understanding it correct  it means as long as you previously ever had a Citi credit card  you will never be considered NTB anymore?,btohqsg
Did you check any other clauses that states the NTB period?,btohqsg
"Yes  it did state the usual 12 months period that thing everyone knows about (the ""loophole"").But this new terms effectively negates this loophole.",btohqsg
You answered yourself on the NTB period. Nothing is changed  and it's not even a loophole.,btohqsg
"I agree  except on this point which I don't recall previously seeing""For clarity  an existing Citibank Credit Card account includes a prior applicationfor any Citibank Credit Card that has been approved by Citibank Bank even if thephysical Citibank Credit Card has not been received by the customer and/or has notbeen activated or utilized by the customer.""",btohqsg
It means citi will now additionally check if you were previous Citi card holder (even before 12 months period). If yes  then Citi won't treat you as NTB,btohqsg
It seems like you did not read UOB KF TnC. Only 7 OTAs with SQ min $800 requirements will be awarded with 3mpd. Suggest you read the card TnC before using the card.,btohqsg
Not sure why you're mixing both clauses. Do you have another Citibank CC that's approved but not activated?,btohqsg
I have entirely closed all my Citibank accounts about 1.5 years ago and no applications submitted. So I would think i should be considered NTB already. (according to the 12 months terms).But this new term is confusing me.31. An ‚ÄúExisting Customer‚Äù refers to applicants who meet the following conditions:i. has an existing Citibank Credit Card account** For clarity  an existing Citibank Credit Card account includes a prior applicationfor any Citibank Credit Card that has been approved by Citibank Bank even if thephysical Citibank Credit Card has not been received by the customer and/or has notbeen activated or utilized by the customer.,btohqsg
If i'm reading it correctly  Citi basically is stopping people from churning the rewards,btohqsg
"There's nothing confusing. Some people think that if they receive the CC but don't activate  they are considered as ""NTB"" for ""unused card"".",btohqsg
not sure how u interpret like that,btohqsg
Hmm  did anyone try doing this NTB churning strat with Citi in the last 3-6months and was succesful?,btohqsg
I am fairly certain this term did not exist at least 1+ year back,btohqsg
Because people blur think never activate means ok. Have to cancel even if unactivated.,btohqsg
I dont think anyone has succeeded with that. Citi just added that to make it clear.,btohqsg
Wait. We are still at ‚Äúcard approved and received the card but not activated‚Äù,btohqsg
Churning he meant apply Citibank CC 12 months after cancellation.,btohqsg
what churning strat u referring to? As usual need to not hold any citibank credit card for 12 months.,btohqsg
Churn means cancel credit card  wait 12 months and re-apply to be considered NTB.What I mean to ask is  did anyone in the last 3-6months or so manage to succesfully pull this off?,btohqsg
