"By getting 16k miles  you are losing out 450 cash value. Hence  equivalent to ""buying"" 16k miles at 450$. People could ""buy"" 10k miles at 196$ annual fee and not many do that. It's terrible value.",btohqsg
And you gotta redeem suites/first class to value a mile more than 2.81 cents.,btohqsg
Are there any extra charges if i invest via RSP with my bank account instead of universal acocunt on moomoo?,btohqsg
Is the new Moomoo Cash Plus 6.8% Existing User Promo worth it?https://www.honeymoneysg.com/post/review-moomoo-sg-cash-plus-existing-user-6-8-p-a-promotionReference to earlier post:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/224367üëâ Discuss morehttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüëâ More referralhttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
The primary rule of Miles is: Don't overvalue your cents per mile,btohqsg
No  in fact it is much more convenient,btohqsg
Anyone here tried porting over from zym mobile to gomo esim?,btohqsg
Hi ! If let‚Äôs say after I inject fresh funds  can I use the some of the fresh funds to buy stocks and still be eligible for the promotion ?,btohqsg
Yes  as long as you meet the fresh funds requirement,btohqsg
5-8cpm is the equivalent mathematical value/cost  but the important factor is worth  i.e. how much would one have paid for that same ticket in cash.,btohqsg
So I tried porting over since sunday night and received an sms says that it will be ported over at 2am. Till now I am still not connected to gomo network,btohqsg
Gomo CSO said it will be resolve with 24-48 hours. everytime I check they keep gaslighting me saying need another 24-48 hours. So yah  wanted to check if anyone had an issue like this before,btohqsg
Mine took an hour that's all,btohqsg
dayum. Mine was supposed to be done within a few hours too according to the sms. That's why I am puzzled why am I not connected till now,btohqsg
Tried using atome and hsbc rev and worked. So the same logic should applied to citi too.,btohqsg
By overvalue  u mean taking into account how much we are willing to pay for a ticket as opposed to the actual ticket ah?,btohqsg
No  it means how much cpm banks are willing to sell you miles at (for a profit!). And yet some value their own miles higher than bankshttps://youtu.be/faKTziNGHGI?si=2E4lnC3Hbcy0Iw3R,btohqsg
