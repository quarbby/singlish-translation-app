Yes that is plus point for me since I have a Chinese sim,btohqsg
Many cards have low to no forex fees just look at Chris lobangs,btohqsg
But iphone warranty is country base not worldwide,btohqsg
Nope iPhone warranty is worldwide  buy iPhone in Singapore can be replace in other country other than Hong Kong cause it is dual sim,btohqsg
So buy hk iphone any issued can repair in sg?,btohqsg
I just saw got $300 cdc voucher which will expire end of this year. Is there an effective way to spend them on shot.,btohqsg
Actually yes u can  unless it is due to cellular issues or u purchase apple care plus in Hong Kong,btohqsg
So there is restriction also wah lol,btohqsg
But if u purchase in Singapore go Hong Kong cannot service idk y  probably due to the Hong Kong laws  sg Apple not that strict,btohqsg
If it is screen  charging port  battery everything can be repair lah  if it is cellular than cannot,btohqsg
It is still cover under Apple limited warranty other than the cellular,btohqsg
150 use for grocery  150 u can go neighbour hood store to see what u need to get stock up item u usually use,btohqsg
Ya cellular is the reason why i say warranty issue. To get replacement very mafan,btohqsg
But they can help u ship it back to Hong Kong Apple for replacement or repair :),btohqsg
Depends on the staff want to help u or not lol,btohqsg
But I think UOB Visa Signature doesn‚Äôt award 4mpd for Simplygo (assuming the 1k criteria is fulfilled),btohqsg
For mine before HomePod was released in sg my HomePod got issues went to Apple sg they help me ship back for replacement just that need like few weeks,btohqsg
thank you! do you recommend any card for simplygo?,btohqsg
yes dont have  they only issue uni$1 for every $5 üò≠,btohqsg
Sorry i think is sc smart  6 percent cashback no minimum spend,btohqsg
Yeah in ML chat I asked the question about kris+ and krisshop bonus. I‚Äôm unsure. But all these add up. Don‚Äôt think hk much cheaper,btohqsg
Buy in hk for dual sim. Not for price I feel,btohqsg
Bascially for no forex fee card (no cc rebate or low rebate)   use cc pay the 2- 3.5 percent fee to get cc rebate  all in all i think sg still better  just need to buy at the right time,btohqsg
HK I paid lower than 128G 15 pro price for 256G since I got good exchange rate,btohqsg
But i went to HK for business and transit to CN so is on the way. Not worth flying there to just buy an iPhone,btohqsg
Japan iPhones are cheaper too  plus yen is low,btohqsg
I actually Worked out japan too. Only save $120 and run the risk of get caught for gst and potential japan camera beeping sounds.Please don‚Äôt get me wrong. I am saying all this to see what I missed out since I don‚Äôt feel japan or hk iPhones are worth buying compared to buying in Singapore and stacking sg offers.,btohqsg
hmm Japan camera sound can be turned off. It‚Äôs Geo-bounded,btohqsg
Any creditcard recommendations that gives decent cashback n points for people who spend on travel and  online international shoppings?,btohqsg
Yes the shutter sound yes. But a trusted pro tested it out and there is still a beep beep sound when u press photos very quickly.,btohqsg
Oo ok too many perverts in Japan üòπ,btohqsg
Really? I use my iPhone bought in Japan and there‚Äôs still sounds though,btohqsg
I agree with u. I‚Äôm exploring this angle. Pity I missed the kris shop black Friday double miles.,btohqsg
Shud be more than $120 savings la. 124800 yen at exchange rate of 110  plus 10% tax refund and sometimes the stores like DONKI give 5% extra to foreigners with coupon code  should be a lot below sgd$1299 for iPhone 15 128gb,btohqsg
Just start using the iPhone in Japan don‚Äôt think customs will go charge u gst,btohqsg
just nice within 1k limit for amaze+crmc üòπ,btohqsg
Hi  if i link uob one card to samsung pay  and use samsung pay for public transport. Is this considered eligible spending for uob one card?,btohqsg
Dec SSB quantity ceiling 20k üò¢,btohqsg
When will they refund the unallocated cash?,btohqsg
I have AA credit score but can never get approved for a CC. You‚Äôre not alone,btohqsg
Hi. Already 50 but not wise about investing for retirement.. appreciate information on how to buy etf  s&p  and us stocks in Singapore. Many thanksüôèüèªüòä,btohqsg
I think‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll wait out until my score is AA and my previous enquiries to clean up over time then try again. Maybe the combined credit limit is too high compared to my income so cannot be approved?,btohqsg
Guys  if I make a cc payment via hotel's internet payment gateway (ipg)  the transaction will still falls under as hotel category?,btohqsg
hello all  for the 5.8% moomoo promotion  once I hit the 30-day mark  I can withdraw the $$ but still be eligible to receive the remaining % of the moomoo promotion?,btohqsg

Hence my conclusion it is not worth it to buy in Hong Kong.Welcome any comments / critique. Thanks.,btohqsg
Its worth it if i need dual sim i guess,btohqsg
Like I said I don‚Äôt recommend anyone to go HK just to buy an iPhone. But since I was already in HK I thought the pros of a dual sim phone outweighs the cons so I just sprang for it,btohqsg
Hey guys  anyone here tried using Alipay and WeChat Pay (Weixin) in Hong Kong? I installed both but can't verify in Singapore.. Appreciate any comments üòä,btohqsg
What about buy Apple Watch SE in Hong Kong vs Singapore ? üòä,btohqsg
HK accepts intl credit card. You cant verify foreign cards only local CN bank cards,btohqsg
