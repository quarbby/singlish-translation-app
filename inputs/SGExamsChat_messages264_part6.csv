Usually this data is sold to other scammers  so that they can call your friend and pretend they have personal information to threaten him with something,btohqsg
I won't release the name due to legal concerns but yeah I just wanna know my rights,btohqsg
There's nothing much he can do except not to pick up unsolicited calls and pretend the number is a dead number  and to change his bank credit card if he gave it away,btohqsg
I dont think he gave away any other details other than the ones he mentioned to me so,btohqsg
I think ill just let him know what you told me  thanks!,btohqsg
The JD is broad enough to include saikang,btohqsg
Honestly any job scope except for managerial will require you to do saikang,btohqsg
and I mean even full-time positions,btohqsg
Is it acceptable to request job description in contract,btohqsg
You should be applying based on JD in general,btohqsg
If it's through a recruitment company that's obligated to keep their client anonymous  they should actually do a preliminary talk with you first with slightly more detail about what their client does,btohqsg
Applying blind is a big no,btohqsg
I was interviewed  and I asked the interviewer about the day to day,btohqsg
I was told  you just have to serve the students lunch and teach them how to do homework and do our curriculum,btohqsg
Welp  sometimes interviewer don't actually know what people do on the ground,btohqsg
Legally  they are allowed to ask you to clean toilets  ethically of course not good.,btohqsg
This job was gotten through a recruitment agency?,btohqsg
Coz anyway  from what you've mentioned  the workplace definitely is not a good working environment what with all the understaffing and saikang,btohqsg
If there's no favourable termination clause then just serve another 3 weeks and leave,btohqsg
sorry hahah I'm terrible at this,btohqsg
but ok I can be fired for lateness and no show  and I won't have to serve notice,btohqsg
doesn't sit right with me though,btohqsg
Interview was from HR of the company,btohqsg
but yea I'll probably do this,btohqsg
I won't recommend this coz you never know what kind of connections a person has,btohqsg
sheesh why ruin the vibe :/,btohqsg
HR sometimes don't really know the full day-to-day as well,btohqsg
But if you signed a contract  they should have termination clauses,btohqsg
one month notice  and only on the last day of the month,btohqsg
so any such window was over on June 30th and I'd still have to do until end July,btohqsg
Have to finish the remaining 3 weeks,btohqsg

I was thinking  can ask her to write in Chinese then I translate,btohqsg

Just write urself and ask her sign,btohqsg
