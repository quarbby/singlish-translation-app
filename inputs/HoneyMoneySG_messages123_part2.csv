Ocbc 90n have promo fee on cardup at 1.3 mpd. Quite a good deal i think. If u are new to cardup even better rate,btohqsg
Cardup spend will qualify for OCBC 360 spend too I think. Even better haha.,btohqsg
Yes ocbc 90n is one of the card for spend category of ocbc 360,btohqsg
Yes.. card up sometimes have promotion... when neat tax period.. wait for Feb 25 come,btohqsg
People not talking about tax  they asking about car loan,btohqsg
I have been 5 days  let me email them üôè,btohqsg
Ok so based on this  it would be tough to find a cashback card that's giving 8% right? Since like amex cashback card which most ppl uses or recommend is like 3% and some are lower? Unless we are talking very specific cards which focus on certain merchant or category that might be higher than 8%? I believe this is how most of the gurus here break it down and compare? Sorry if my understanding still subparüòÖ,btohqsg
I mention 8% since 1.5 to 2cpm for economy is what ppl deemed worth. So I took 2cpm x 4,btohqsg
There‚Äôs HSBC Live+ card that offers 8% cashback till end of 2024. Some people prefer cashback cards because there is expiry to the point system and miles or they do not travel much.,btohqsg
Yes... cash back is good for grads and also those starting out for work.,btohqsg
Hi all  just realised I am losing out a lot of miles on DBS altitude card as it is rounded down to the nearest $5  is there any recommended cards to replace it?,btohqsg
That's the real world of local credit card üí≥  of blocks of 5,btohqsg
Its annoying but lesson learnt  tryna figure out how to get more bang for the buck,btohqsg
Also the reason why I cancel Uob preferred visa and replace with citi rewards.,btohqsg
I have citi rewards  I'm considering citi premier miles to replace dbs altitude:/ will do some digging to find out if there are any better cards,btohqsg
I heard dbs attitude card. They take long time to give you welcome bonus miles and also you paid your annual fee already,btohqsg
This maybe incorrect  there is a formula in ML  ocbc and uob are $5 block  not dbs,btohqsg
For me actually I don't want to apply for dbs woman card... I already planned 6 months ahead of time.. because of revolution hsbc nerf air flights tickets and also Hotels ....going to cancel revolution next year,btohqsg
DBS Altitude min. local spend $1.54. Points calculated by spend / 5 * 3.25.,btohqsg
when applying krisflyer uob  should you link the card to krisflyer membership?,btohqsg
Yes. Why do u not want to link?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows Hoe Kee's mcc?,btohqsg
This provide much clearer perspective. Thanks!But the trick is to make sure hit 600 for all 4 months on the right merchant?I realised why I opt for miles more also because in my line  I have to make big ticket purchase which are probably not covered under most of the standard merchant code  so I am guessing it's more convenient and more worth it to collect miles since the cashback might not even cover it. I am guessing this based on what I have learnt so far from the gurus here,btohqsg
for mcc codes go download theheymax.aiapp,btohqsg
Around 5-6 months for me and I requested for a refund of annual fees and they deducted 5000dbs point or 10000miles,btohqsg
i assume that the expiry of miles will kick start once transfer to kris flyer but if using card validity could accumulate 2 years in uob before transferring lump sum miles to enjoy longer expiry,btohqsg
this card earn krisflyer miles directly  cannot store at uob side,btohqsg
Hi for these sign up bonus for miles  am I safe to assume when they say spent x amount of dollars  it can be on anything as long clock the card with the amount right?,btohqsg
Must be qualifying spend as defined by the bank. Check the tncs.,btohqsg
Yes I use heymax but I am not sure if its right. So I wanted to ask if anyone has any prior experience after buying from them,btohqsg
How about if using crmc does tt  make it an online spend ?,btohqsg
Some people need install backup brain,btohqsg
You can use empty amaze wallet to verify as well.,btohqsg
I will have to tap at the shop but I will try,btohqsg
Why do you request for refund,btohqsg
Question: For recurring telco bills  if my mode of payment is Amaze (linked to CRMC)  will I get miles?I‚Äôve been paying adhoc via the starhub app using CRMC directly to get miles. Understand using CRMC and setting up recurring payment will not earn you miles. But wondering if there‚Äôs another more efficient and automatic way to do this  hence the above question.TIA!,btohqsg
Hi fellow members  any advice whether to invest in tbills or sgs using CPF OA? Have ard 100k to invest,btohqsg
SGS usually interest rate very low  even lower than SSB. But CPF cannot be used to invest in SSB. You can try the 1 year T-bill,btohqsg
"Why you asking a rookie question?!  You've been around the block for quite a long time liao. Thought you ""Lao Jiao"" status already! üò±",btohqsg
Ok thanks  do i all in onto one Tbill or spread it out monthly?,btohqsg
U thought it's Singapore Girls School issit? hehehe üòú,btohqsg
Singapore Government Securities (SGS) bonds  Treasury bills (T-bills)  and Singapore Savings Bonds (SSB).Holy Trinity.,btohqsg
Hi hi....sorry noob question....If i link my amaze card to google wallet  and i use phone to tap on paywave  will it still be a online transaction for citi-rewards card?,btohqsg
Hi guys  What's the ideal way to withdraw monies in USD? I have some investments in USD. If I plan to sell  I was advised by dbs to do an international wire into my multiplier account in USD to avoid fx conversion risk.,btohqsg
for ocbc acct 360 credit card spend  can I combine reward and 90N for $500 min spend? example $300 to reward and $200 to 90N,btohqsg
Hi is there any benefit to pairing Amaze with uobone,btohqsg
Not possible  UOB One is Visa,btohqsg
Okok thank you. So it must be a Mastercard. Can I check  when pairing with Citirewards  the points redemption is it on Citi membership rewards or amaze rewards for converting points to miles,btohqsg
Try reading a bit more on citi rewards and understanding how this combo works.,btohqsg
Can I redeem my uni$ to krisflyer miles into my wife's krisflyer account or it must be my own krisflyer account?,btohqsg
