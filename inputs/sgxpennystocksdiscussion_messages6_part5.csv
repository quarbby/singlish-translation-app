Still unable to push up the price...,btohqsg
Why do you say that? Advice,btohqsg
dont know la just careful can le,btohqsg
Medtec 13th July sharp drop if calculate is about 40% drop before it went back up.If you take recent drop till now from $1.90 40% drop is price at $1.14. Maybe will bounce back up after.If not just wait for november QR,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice. Will monitor closely,btohqsg
Medtecs was $0.03x start of 2020.Covid19 and all  it has already made such a big run.If play this  make sure got automatic cut loss.,btohqsg
abuance still ok la bro i only bot 32 120 lots,btohqsg
might add if i see some movement,btohqsg
https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/amp/chinese-news-54159615China I think also jialat...under reporting and try to cover up,btohqsg
But gloves counters keep dropping these few days... not like last time le... every few days will have small rebound...,btohqsg
Business have competition and there‚Äôs almost nothing proprietary in making such apparrels etc.The chinese probably have a newly set up town which is focus on such manufacturing set up.Just be careful. Every bubble bursts eventually,btohqsg
Everyone made a lot on medical stocks liao,btohqsg
Must give and take at times,btohqsg
Yea those made already made big   they can afford to lose some. But new player come in can lose a lot when it goes south.If play Medtecs  just set auto stop loss. Just a friendly advice,btohqsg
Yeah  probably due to anticipation of post covid and phase 3. All slowly exiting medical stocks,btohqsg
My platform no stop loss ;(,btohqsg

True also.. Donald Trump says vaccine ready within 4 weeks. So every week is bad news for ppe counters,btohqsg
