My teachers said something like you dont really need to use a lot of atas words,btohqsg
Using it is good but if they cant find fault in your grammar then you can get an A,btohqsg
atas word doesn't mean much esp if u use it wrongly,btohqsg
Especially the more prestigious university ones,btohqsg
there are scholarships which do not require this I sourced for it; but your grades have to be really really really damn good,btohqsg
I’m not really interested in those,btohqsg
Those are mostly from NUS or UK-based if I’m not mistaken,btohqsg
then asking abt this is kinda misleading,btohqsg
anyone can send me template for job resume,btohqsg
There’s one at MySkillsFuture (login via SingPass) where they automatically include stuff like GCE exam  and any WSQ courses u took (eg if u work in FnB  chances are you’d have taken the food hygiene course; this will be included as well),btohqsg
