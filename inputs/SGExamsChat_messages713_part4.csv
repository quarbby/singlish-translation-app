Yeah which is why I said hnitec lor but the last word I got was that it was still limited to certain courses,btohqsg
"all these are called ""whitepapers""  the kind you everytime hear abt government getting caught with scandals withits documents the govt release to the public for them to analyse/gather info etc",btohqsg

"""oh u malay means u dumb u chinese means u smart""",btohqsg
but that logic doesn't hold for whether someone passes a math exam,btohqsg
this trend is similar to percentage of people from each ethnicity that goes to uni,btohqsg
a lot of malay families (and this is also from their own words) encourage their kids to work asap like not bother with uni,btohqsg
the perception on education and work is different,btohqsg
like for two malay friends i made in uni  both of them are the only person going uni in their families with like 4 siblings,btohqsg
their parents want them to work asap and provide for the fam,btohqsg
"instead of ""wasting"" money on a degree",btohqsg
end up both those friends self fund themselves for uni,btohqsg
i mean they have mendaki tho so they didn't pay for uni,btohqsg
but in terms of daily expenditure they settle themselves,btohqsg
the two malay friends  one of them is the going Germany for masters one,btohqsg
one of them now interning overseas then going to work at UN potentially,btohqsg
"society sees it as ""malay go void deck play guitar football etc  chinese go for tution  enrichement classas blah blah blah"" not tryna be racist but is the cold hard truth ig",btohqsg
like i won't deny there's a level of prejudice and preferential treatment that pushes this trend further but a lot of it is def the culture,btohqsg
Lmao its been 4 years since he took that mod and he's still salty about that,btohqsg
it's almost ironic bc those malay friends of mine got pressured to just work when they wanted to study to the point where they now p much separate their lives from the fam alr,btohqsg
