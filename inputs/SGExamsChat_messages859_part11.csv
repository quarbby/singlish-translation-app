good luck on entrance. heard it's highly competitive to join their CS nowadays.,btohqsg
also CS not really employable also right now haha,btohqsg
with the current US job market.,btohqsg
I wonder why so many people want to go in CS lol,btohqsg
I remember when being a doctor or lawyer was the boomer way,btohqsg
Always --> Doctor  Engineer  Lawyer  Accounting.,btohqsg
ah mostly  I feel because software dev. earns more,btohqsg
I think CS can easily earn $5k-6k entry in Singapore. if they didn't get low balled.,btohqsg
hire fast fire fast for most of them,btohqsg
Ikr  and then you see accountant being outsourced,btohqsg
in Intel culture  you will hear old folks waiting for VSS application.,btohqsg
5k - 6k tbh a bit hard,btohqsg
Even my friend got only 4.8k at best,btohqsg
A cousin was in this line. Mid of last yr kenna retrenched  till now cannot find job.Employers will prefer younger grads with no kids,btohqsg
my brother used to work for KPMG in Singapore.Damn $6.5k associate position you want work die him from 8am to 3am/5am the next day....,btohqsg

I hope your brother is doing better now,btohqsg
I work mostly as a laptop technican so my stress level is low,btohqsg
But quite fun to collect free SSDs,btohqsg
but $6.5k - $2k expenses * 12 months. I think convert back to MYR x 3.3 multiplier   I think should be comfy for atleast 1-2 years. lol,btohqsg
sadly I didn't work as a Validation Engineer anymore after my Intel Trainee program.,btohqsg
It's all fun and games until you open an Alienware,btohqsg
Then you wonder why got missing screws,btohqsg
ah  those are nothing  cracked hinge and screw mounts are the nightmares lol,btohqsg
The best part is shorting a person's laptop,btohqsg
When he got deadline the next day,btohqsg
should added an A4 paper beneath before screwing back everything. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
It's mor funny when the cat go and knock off my stuff,btohqsg
Or go and sit on the keyboard,btohqsg
So fun playing with end users' pets,btohqsg
But business or law students salary gd?,btohqsg
ahhh if personal advice  if you have money earning from Uni times.Better learn how to invest money.,btohqsg
I tot entering law gg alrdy with chatgpt,btohqsg
Day tradings earns more than your University Tuition Fees. lol,btohqsg
I have university friend  started day trading during Uni.,btohqsg

other day told me he reached financial freedom with $150k USD in his trading account,btohqsg
and he just wait Intel offer him Voluntary Separation Package then he can go retire.,btohqsg
From my understanding both business and law is good salary. But ppl wld recommend business more,btohqsg
Plus law is quite stressful from my understanding,btohqsg
But tbh business side you deal woth snakes more uh,btohqsg
So rlly is a pick your poison kind of scenario,btohqsg
