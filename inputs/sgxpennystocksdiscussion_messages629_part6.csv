Yesterday’s daily volume was highest in 3 years . Average should be about $0.31.Most likely is some players collecting the chips  with the intent to flush yesterdays retailer.They have been in steady range of $0.290 to $0.320.I believe  matter of time we will see a long candle break out.It’s makes cents / sense since we are moving into re-opening and welcoming back tourists.The anticipation will bring this counter up.Added some $0.30.I got a feeling they might suddenly spring up. Let’s see,btohqsg
