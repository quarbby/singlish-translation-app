This I agree bro. Without oddle. Lalamove is useless,btohqsg
Just wait until u get the job again ..,btohqsg
Last time I think k one day,btohqsg
Oh. Ok. Hopefully Tmr can take,btohqsg
This is  car order uh ?,btohqsg
Guys just avoid this virgin pizza at asia square. Told one order before. Was early but I got lost at the condo but still manage to deliver within an hour.Today I took their order again and they cancel on me. That is why I think most probably Oddle block me,btohqsg
Same .. last time I tio ban because yum Cha cancelled my order . Today I go to take yum Cha order again .when I reached go up they said customer cancelled order.,btohqsg
Not very fair that oddle customer cancel then we whole day can’t take any oddle order,btohqsg
Especially on a Sunday or Saturday,btohqsg
Tomorrow I can rest Liao …,btohqsg
Car timing also same with bike is it?,btohqsg
I thought of changing from bike to car,btohqsg
Difficult ..seldom go shopping mall ..need to pay car park .,btohqsg
Hotel still ok. Ask the security to let u part outside,btohqsg
Not new almost 4 months but first time kanna this,btohqsg
1st time cancelled order by this restaurant (oddle) then kena ban ?,btohqsg
Yes dunno is it really unlucky or not,btohqsg
Any idea what time they will refresh the soft ban ? So maybe I can do oddle for Tmr lunch ?,btohqsg
Hi anyone app look like this now ?,btohqsg
For delivery to condo  dont use the gps from llm. Use your own goggle map with the condo name.,btohqsg
The llm gps usually will bring u to the wrong address or side gate of the condo,btohqsg
I also kena many times at hv and bukit timah condo,btohqsg
So much trouble and so directive LOL,btohqsg
Usually this type I just ignore,btohqsg
But still got driver will take...lol,btohqsg
Mine ok already   can take oddle job,btohqsg
Yes llm cannot make it ..,btohqsg
Llm got best price amongst others platforms,btohqsg
Otherwise all quit long time ago,btohqsg
Have to achieve the target in a very short time every week.,btohqsg
4 days to hit target. I can’t even hit this amount from thurs to sun. Don’t know why they send me this.,btohqsg
and have to hit those numbers without stacking oddle.,btohqsg
Full time ok lah. But i doing part time when I have time. Plus weekends quite tough sometimes because of family commitments.,btohqsg
At least now the mission I receive.. if I fail to hit target  they will make it easier for me the following week.,btohqsg
But this is good for those that have been able to achieve this number of orders during weekends.,btohqsg
Camp in cbdDon't leave more than 5km from town,btohqsg
They just want pple to do any job  even those low paying ones,btohqsg
Plus the guaranteed income they give is b4 deduct commission,btohqsg
They tryg to seduce us waste petrol help them do the jobs No1 want take,btohqsg
Yah I also think so too,btohqsg
Even the mission they give us also,btohqsg
Many of the merchants kena Blacklisted le. They find it hard to get delivery riders or drivers to come. Those the name smelly one.,btohqsg
Cos wkends norm more jobs. Pple will aim those high paying or +$ jobs. Then those jobs not so appealing hang for very long. Customers of llm will feel sian. So with mission  pple will cheong for the jobs to hit target,btohqsg
Mission incentive so little. I already 1 mth plus nvr accept mission liao,btohqsg
