Yes. People who emptied end of May should be safe.,btohqsg
Can I use lady’s card to earn 4 miles/dollar for travel catogery to book under gha discovery app?,btohqsg
I see! So means those people would have forsaken the one account bonus interest for June.,btohqsg
Have you tried parking cash here before??,btohqsg
Read the definition of fresh fund,btohqsg
Have to find somewhere to park to get interest lorh,btohqsg
Got it. Thanks so much! I am so confused by this earmark thing,btohqsg
ThanksTrazora! I should have been more explicit in my qns to avoid people referring me to T&Cs... I was asking for people's experience in previous rounds  how many days after deposit will the funds be usually earmarked... Cos that's an indication that the amount is correct. For context  I chose 150k  have maintained 1k balance since May. But in June  I have ~30k in and out within the same day. So I wanted to use the earmark as an early indication if my 150k today is counted... Going by the T&Cs strictly  my 150k-30k only results in 120k fresh fund  so since I've selected 150k  if it isn't sufficient  the entire fund wouldn't be earmarked at all.,btohqsg
Dbs yuu SingTel bill payment via Kisok- when I am selecting Amex option at the kiosk  it’s showing an error (100 deny). Anyone know how to fix?,btohqsg

what is your monthly average balance for Jun? You can probably check the June MAB on uob app tomorrow,btohqsg
Wa finally they opened up again,btohqsg
I'm not so much concerned about the MAB. I emptied my account in May... And my deposits in June was transferred out immediately before day end so end of day balance isn't increased. But my main concern is if those intra day deposit will be counted against the fresh fund requirement...,btohqsg
EXACTLY.. this is what i am also UNSURE..salary credit say $10k come in on 15th June... then I move out immediately... will be caught by the stupid clause?,btohqsg
I know there has been lengthy discussions on this topic above.But I would like to summarise:Nobody is really sure how UOB will calculate/enforce.BUT  in the worse case situation  we still get 4% p.a. if earmark fails. About 6% p.a. if earmark is successful and no clawback/penalty nonsense. So I would say it is still worth a try.,btohqsg
should be $0 then other than the base interest for May,btohqsg
UOB one card pay ZYM online also get cb ?,btohqsg
Thx u for always being kind to clear the doubts 🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg
Hi all  I plan to move all my money from OCBC 360 to HSBC EGA. Is it safe to do it today? Since OCBC 360 will credit salary and save bonus between 7-9 July only,btohqsg
Just move your other bonus interests when they are deposited,btohqsg
Amex TC also can giro via HSBC EGA right?,btohqsg
Can I leave it blank? I understand OCBC 360 need to maintain 3K,btohqsg
If you don't mind ending up with negative values,btohqsg
I see then to avoid any deduction. Better to keep 3K as per the account regulation to maintain 3’,btohqsg
"Checking regarding the singsaver june promo for citi cards. It says bill payment will be ""non-qualifying"" payment. Is TMC 24hr clinic considered bill payment?",btohqsg
Ocbc 360 first year waive fall below fee so I can keep zero ?,btohqsg
I have same plan. Waiting to cancel ocbc maybe after 6 months,btohqsg
Oh why cancel? OCBC still give a good interest for 4.05%HSBC EGA got many steps need to perform 😂. As what I know is trsf 2000 every month + 5 transactions.,btohqsg
I plan to credit back to OCBC after few months,btohqsg
Hi Chris   what do you think of chocolate finance? Any thoughts anyone?,btohqsg
Just talked about Chocolate Finance herehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/214552,btohqsg
That is under Managed account in Other,btohqsg
What does preferred really means?Favourite. Or where most money is?,btohqsg
Uob one + saver promo confirmed highest eir approx 5.6% pa. But max $150k.HSBC EGA max $360k but 4.x%.Both good kind of hard to choose one only. But I voted for HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
T-Bill 12 x $1mil infinity roll.,btohqsg
Chocolate finance states that if make more than 4.2% then they will charge a fee betweeen 0-2%. Does anyone know if this fee is on anything above 4.2% earnings only?,btohqsg
any idea if we can activate shopback + heymax together?,btohqsg
No. Only the last activated one will work.,btohqsg
for UOB Savings promo  only can qualify if account is zeroed out at/before 31 May right?coz TnC say 30 days before or during the promotion period. So if you had zeroed out 1 June it will be within the 30 days already?,btohqsg
Don't zero out also can. Just add on top of it. Of course EIR will be lowered,btohqsg
Thank you. Just checking. Have a friend who zeroed out on 1st or 2nd June. I think cannot qualify for the savings promo already ...,btohqsg
Anyone used interactive broker? Is this better then moomoo? 🤔,btohqsg
How can you compare ibkr to moomoo? Ibkr is one of the largest brokers in the world,btohqsg
Not asking to compare coverage. More on fees and usage.,btohqsg
I use Interactive Brokers. I prefer it just cus its not from a china company,btohqsg
I will never trust a China company to hold my assets even if in trust.,btohqsg
IBKR risk mgmt is also considered to be quite good one leh due to Thomas petterfy’s options background,btohqsg

Can I top up like $30k and maintain for 5 days then transfer out (ADB=>$5k) ?  Dino how long for my application to be approved. Am Existing cimb debit acc holder,btohqsg
Nothing racist. It's the reputation of companies' home country's regulatory system. It's hard facts.,btohqsg
U obviously haven’t observed how China companies treat investors when they run into trouble……,btohqsg
Hi All  hope anyone can help me out. I have Citi Rewards  Hsbc Revo  POSB everyday cards. Which of these cards is best to use for fuel? Thanks in advance. 😊,btohqsg
If the country enforced better regulations  could have stopped them from doing these bullshit 🤪,btohqsg
China government protects own people. Overseas investors bear the bulk of losses.,btohqsg
Protect their own rich people* 🤣,btohqsg
You certainly don't see enough. US also have similar issue around too. Bastards is everywhere I will say. So I won't racism any country just by individual incident.,btohqsg
Does the self transfer to UOB One via UOB SALA  still work?,btohqsg
will update when i get the call,btohqsg
Your words not specific enough tho. You are not ineligible. You can still register 150k  on top of the 150k you withdrawn on 1 Jun.,btohqsg
Is it racism if its against my own race?,btohqsg
ok wow  thanks for that. shall explicitly ask about it in the call,btohqsg
Hello Shifus Does anyone know whats up with this OCBC 365 “Recurring bills promo” on their website? -https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tncs-governing-the-ocbc-365-cc-recurring-billings-promo.pdfI don’t get it  is it additional 3% cashback on top of the original 365 cashback or is it the TnC of how to get cashback on recurring bill payments on 365 originally (as part of card benefits)? Thanks in advance if anyone can shed some lightIf it is the latter  this is absurd LOL - you must make (1) 1 new bill payment + (2) 1 recurring payment AND if same billing organisation you pay multiple bills  only count as 1 bill available for cashback. So my fam household all different line on MVNO tagged to diff people so the bills are separate. How is this then a freaking promo when it should be an original entitlement of 3% cashback as per card original TnC?Wth man OCBC is retarded with this pua stunt. Does any other banks do the same as well?,btohqsg

Today I’m supposed to get my moomoo 6.8% cash coupon  does anyone know usually what time it should appear ?,btohqsg
I think the 30 days withdrawal thingy is to determine the balance for our reference month.I mean if you put the money for  example  20 days  and withdraw it for whatever reason  the average daily balance of that 20 days will still earn 4.60% interest. While for UOB the money is locked if we want to have the EIR of 5.60%.,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/214559Uncharted waters on how Uob and HSBC will deal with the tnc.Scb has been there all along and not strictly enforced.,btohqsg
I want to check with you experts on the 30 days withdrawal for hsbc Ega. Say for example the average daily balance of the reference month is $10k...then today I put in $20k from another bank and I withdraw $15k on the same day and tomorrow I put in $30k,btohqsg
So what is my fresh funds under hsbc lingo?,btohqsg
Strictly speaking:$20 - 15 + 30 = $35k fresh funds.,btohqsg
May i ask.. when we already have a giro set up with a bank (eg. ocbc) after i apply giro with another bank  what will happen?Will it get rejected? If its accepted  do i need to manually terminate my previous GIRO set up  or its auto?,btohqsg
It will replace the old giro. Just keep old giro in place until new one is in place,btohqsg
How come the UOB interest is lesser than last month while the average balance increases?,btohqsg

For HSBC EGA's July & Aug promo  if deposit 100K  the earned bonus interest will only be credited on 31 October (assuming fulfilling $2k deposited & 5 transactions done). So between 1 Sept - 30th Oct  we are required to maintain the 100K in the account? Otherwise wont qualify to get the earned interest bonus?,btohqsg
For HSBC  how to check that we already fulfil the 5 transactions ?,btohqsg
If need less than S$400 in cash  can opt for YouTrip for withdrawal at overseas ATM,btohqsg
They will send sms to confirm you are eligible. Not instant though.,btohqsg
Just do both criterias one shot on the first day then no need to worry Liao.,btohqsg
It is ok.. mine is > 400. I will just draw cash to exchange,btohqsg
Is it! Should have sign up for Jun step up.😢,btohqsg
No need to as long as qualified and month ended. HSBC will remember and pay u the interest by promised date.Caveat. Account must be in good standing.,btohqsg
Just checked with the HSBC CSO  was told the same principal amount (fresh fund) needs to be kept in the account till bonus interest is being credited. She verified with another specialist knowledgeable in EGA.,btohqsg
Not true  bonus interest take ard 3 month to credit,btohqsg
Which means in the month of Sept & Oct  you will be earning a prevailing interest rates of 0.05% 😞,btohqsg
Bluff u oneU get cso to email u in black and white. Confirm can get compensation vouchers for lying. Haha 😝,btohqsg
"Not talking about the timeline here. But principal needs to remain in the account till you get the bonus interest. I even asked if maintaining minimum amount will do  she verified with the ""specialist"" again and answer is NO.",btohqsg
I am telling i dont maintain it and i get the bonus interest  alot of user here also get it without maintaining,btohqsg
I am assuming you have EGA and no problems so far?,btohqsg
Since day 1. No issue because I’m kiasu and kiasi. And never just in time. And never just enough.,btohqsg
Unless they changed it I also got the bonus interest  withdrew after my bonus interest months,btohqsg
There is no tnc to maintain the fund after the bonus interest period,btohqsg
Actually I said the same thing. That's when she verified with her colleague again.,btohqsg
If it is not in tnc then it is not  like i say cso can give wrong info at times,btohqsg
Yep. Understand. Not all CSO are knowledge in terms of all the products.,btohqsg

Hii any advice on where to put ~$100-$150k and which cc to use to hit the min spend? Is ocbc 360 the best now?,btohqsg
There's a t&c change on this. I this round chicken out stay in SCB  wait for dp from people who chiong in,btohqsg
Huh. U mean u agree with HSBC cso? Which clause,btohqsg
Oh. This one I’m pretty sure is typo. BUT why keep in EGA month 2. Move out LiaoOp was worried about cso saying funds must stay in EGA until bonus interest paid. No way this is real.,btohqsg
Sometimes their t&c really anyhow one,btohqsg
Recycle the wording won't change.. but they add additional line,btohqsg
Recycle using competitor language cut and paste. Haha,btohqsg
my understanding  you dont even need to maintain the money for july and august. That's why some people are using 2 accounts to rotate the money between the 2 accounts to get additional 1% bonus interest from top-up amount,btohqsg
I would think at this moment uob one account with 150k is the best,btohqsg
Hi can check. The stock cash coupon  minimum order amount is how much?,btohqsg
Hello  I’m an existing lady’s cardholder and have successfully upgraded to solitaire. I have received the approval sms on 30th June and saw the new card in the PIB site on the same day but card was only reflected in my tmrw app today. Will the second category take effect this quarter or only on 1 Oct?,btohqsg
No min  but each coupon is S$10  so will buy S$10 at least,btohqsg
Thanks  the coupon can use to fulfill the second condition of cash coupon reward?,btohqsg
You are right. They edited already lol,btohqsg
Which card to use for the $500 min spend though. The $800 min spend for evol is a bit high for me to hit per month. I don’t qualify for the solitaire yet so if i get lady’s card  it’s only 1 cat 🥲,btohqsg
Doesn’t a supervisor proof read the tnc before it’s posted. Sheesh.,btohqsg
Maybe their supervisor also outsourced? 🤪,btohqsg
Not sure  but I used pure cash for BUY trades to avoid any confusion,btohqsg
Check with cso on uob chat assist the new card cat,btohqsg
Hmm ok. Will go look up more abt it. Thank you!,btohqsg
If I cancelled a credit card one year ago as I didn’t want to pay the annual fee second year onwards  if I apply again now  will the first year fee still be free?,btohqsg
Sorry not sure why I can't reply on your query. Yup I am using uob one card too. Transport and food all are accepted so pretty easy to hit 500,btohqsg
The only downside is that I have to always ensure that i spend a min of $500 consecutively right?,btohqsg
Wa for posb investment  if u sold off before the marker move  it won’t count for the month?,btohqsg
do you pay for any of the household bills? that could be included as well,btohqsg

I emptied my UOB One Account on Sunday in anticipation of new July promo.Just read on UOB's Nation of Savers Promotion. It says new fund is measured against Jun's ave balance.  So  it means I will have to wait for 1 month before transferring my fund from another bank.Any advice for my $150K?,btohqsg
I just opened HSBC EGA and registered sms  plan to do the 5 txn. Is the EIR 4.6% for Jul and Aug month?,btohqsg
So what is your June MAB?,btohqsg
Zero  as hsbc acct open open this month,btohqsg
Am new to hsbc  plans to use hsbc giro for other card payment.,btohqsg
Should be 4.6% for Jul  3.6% for Aug,btohqsg
So mean 1 Sep can transfer out the fund ?.,btohqsg
Is there any cap for hsbc ega deposit?.,btohqsg
You going to top $150k on top of $75k? That will not make sense as balance above $150k will not earn any bonus interest.,btohqsg
I mean Jun mab was $75k.Now I am going to put in $150k,btohqsg
So total is 225k. ur 75k doesnt earn interest.,btohqsg
Actually i think OP took out 75k  now putting in 150k  so fresh fund only 75k.,btohqsg
i notice uob has the samsung galaxy s24 lucky draw as well. Would anyone know if we could register for both this lucky draw as well as the nations of savers promo please?,btohqsg
3.6% for Aug because you are not doing any increment correct?,btohqsg
Yes correct. The 1% for Everyday+ Rewards only for incremental balance compared to previous calendar month (in this case July),btohqsg
That's right. Unless I wait till end Jul then transfer $150k from another bank.,btohqsg
Doesnt matter as ur june MAB is 75k.,btohqsg
So technically to max out  if on 1 July you deposit fresh fund of 360K and did the 5 transactions  you can earn the extra bonus cash reward of $300 (capped) at the end of July.,btohqsg
Did it take a few days to open the account online?,btohqsg
Usually is instant unless you answer wrongly,btohqsg
I have Giro arrangement to pay my Standard Chartered credit card on 15 July. But for some reason  I have already paid my credit card bill full amount. Will there still be a giro deduction of statement amount on 15 July? Thanks!,btohqsg
To get the maximum interest which is $1.1k  you need to empty out the account on 1-Jun and then deposit 150k in Jul.  So now  the fresh fund counted is only $75k and you will get $300. If you think is fine. Anyway  you will also get the 4% interest in Aug when you maintain 150k for the whole of Jul and fulfill the criteria.,btohqsg
No. Giro only deducts remaining balance. It's 0 in ur case so no deduction.,btohqsg
If they receive the payment before giro is initiate then u wont have to pay again,btohqsg
For Amaze  can i pair it with ocbc mastercard?Any ocbc mastercard to recommemd?,btohqsg
So it is better to keep .you $150k  in another back earning interest as well. Wait till 1st Aug then transfer to UOB to earn the $1.1k after 5 months. And of course the usual 4% every month,btohqsg
My view is put back $75k so you can earn the 4% interest for the month of Jul plus the $300 bonus with the 150k. If you have spare cash  you can deposit in another bank account that can help to earn high interest.  That is why if you search in the chat  there are people who use UOB and OCBC 360 accounts together to rotate and earn interest. But that is provided you willing to spend time to do that.,btohqsg
hi all  i’m abit confused. for the EGA account the interest is 3.6% right? the extra 1% is for GIRO payments only? if i read the previous thread correctly…I did not participate in last month’s promo and have negligible amount in EGA last month. if i transfer fresh funds  i’ll get 3.6%?,btohqsg
get 1% rebate for GIRO bill payment and eligible hsbc card spend and also get 1% interest for incremental monthly average balance wrt previous month if fulfilled 2k transfer in and 5 transactions,btohqsg
okay! understand. thanks for the explanation 🙏🏼,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is 0.05%. 3.6% comes from bonus interest promo. 1% comes from Everyday+ rewards.,btohqsg
the Everyday+ rewards is the part i dont quite understand. 😅,btohqsg
I SMS a wrong EGA account number when I participated for bonus interest promotion in April 2024 🤦‍♂️Anybody has HSBC email address? Searched through their website but can't find email address. They only have online chat  but no CS around..,btohqsg
Not worth it for you to play the latest UOB Savings promo...Make sure your UOB One account is empty/minimum for the month of September  expecting a new promo (not guaranteed) in October referencing September's MAB.,btohqsg
Got the call  I enquired about that clause and CSO replied that withdrawing on 1 June will be fine  only MAB of June will matter.,btohqsg
They have a number to call,btohqsg
I think is 1800 472 2669,btohqsg
What about going for HSBC ega first.,btohqsg
i also think they won't enforce.. but i can think what i think..i cannot guarantee..the last thing i want is a few months later  people come back and blame me said i told them won't enforce.,btohqsg
I actually emptied my uob one account on 31st May but wasted interest for June haha and realised I can't open an ega account online today,btohqsg
I can only share what i am actually going to do:1. UOB Savings promo - I am going to use a human that had already had $1k since 1st May 2024. Although still had salary in May and June which I immediately transfer out on the same day it was credited. MAB for May and June is $10xx.2. HSBC EGA promo -JulyI ignored the new '30 days' clause. I am still going to do normally. Put up till $360k cash in Human A  will have ins/outs in the course of the month since I do make use of the cash for investments. This account will also have money in / out due to GIRO arrangements. If they going to exclude in/out cash due to the 30 days  I will suck it up. No choice.AugustMove to Human B,btohqsg
Or ocbc if you do not have one currently,btohqsg
my experience with their call center was not so pleasant.The CS seems like have very limited knowledge about their own product lolThat's why I prefer email or chat where I can have a written record.,btohqsg
Just wanna nag this point again:IT IS IMPOSSIBLE for anyone to keep a liquid savings account with no in/out for 1-2 months..Especially by nature of the product:1. UOB One - needs salary credit2. HSBC EGA - need $2k/15k in + 5 FAST OUT  and use for GIRO paymentsWhoever intends to enforce the 30 days in/out fresh funds rule strictly needs to be bonk on the head.,btohqsg

Hmmmmm understood. Will read more about this.But can I ask if I just want a simple miles card. Which would be better? Like for simplicity,btohqsg
Can we use UOB ppv for Kris+ payment?,btohqsg
Understood  but simple one is which?,btohqsg
get 4mpd only for mcc that fall under the online whitelist in TnC,btohqsg
simplest i feel is uob prvi mastercard 1.4mpd,btohqsg
Because my friend wants to use it for wedding banquet payment therefore wanna try use it to get miles,btohqsg
Imo Visa version is better  in the odd chance of OP wanting to use cardup,btohqsg
only master can link with Amaze mah.. haha.. more flexibility,btohqsg
Linking UOB prvi amaze doesn't earn a lot tbh. You earn 1.4mpd for less fee as compared to 2.4mpd,btohqsg
he want one trick pony... use for everything mah,btohqsg
I meant go overseas just use UOB prvi visa by itself. Cuz the benefits ain't much anyway.,btohqsg
although i would argue if a user just want one card for everything  don't want to learn/switch cards  he/she might be better off using a cashback card for all purposes.,btohqsg
CSPX/SPYL is better for the long term  but when starting out VOO is fine since portfolio is small. Hopefully within 1 years time you can advance to at least $800-$1000 per month then no point using VOO thereafter,btohqsg
I agree. Spending on gen card will take a really long time to redeem a reasonable flight or flights.,btohqsg
Which platform will you be using? I am also looking at this but contemplating which platform to use,btohqsg
Why is the cut off point 800 to 1000?Will the difference in withholding tax out weigh the difference in spread(between buy sell due to volume) and transaction fees?(0.37 usd vs 1.98 usd),btohqsg

Uob Krisflyer card if you can spend minimum 800 bucks on either sia scoot kris shop annually  cos on dining  food delivery  online shopping  travel and transport spend can get 3 miles per dollar. But only if you spend 800 minimallyThe rest 1.2 miles,btohqsg

Oh crap…. Why is the posted date on 2 July but I transferred out on 1 Jul,btohqsg
There is a cut off time for every bank,btohqsg
Anybody encounter in EGA account  the transaction amount transferred-in on 01 June morning but included in May statement with posted date 01 Jun.

Is amaze card still worth it now? Or should i use trust card? If im not wrong  trust card will also convert foreign spending to local spend and save on the bank surcharge.,btohqsg
The first thing u need to find out is what is the Mcc of the credit card terminal where u will be paying at.,btohqsg
Oohhh Marriott hotels.Actually that’s not good news since u cannot make use of the much easier 5812 restaurant category.My suggestions are:$2k Uob lady travel category 6mpd$2k Uob vs PAYWAVE 4mpd$1.1k Uob ppv applepay 4mpdThis covers $5.1k per month. See if husband and wife each apply. That’s $10.2k per month pre payment per month.,btohqsg
You make giro arrangement with your bank account (as a backup). Then set up cardup income tax payment. Dont forget honeymoneysg promo code for card uphttps://t.me/HMSGHive/1791,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
For friend wedding banquet  assume at s'pore hotel  also for daily usage:UOB Visa Signature - min S$1K  max S$2K per statement month  contactless payment. Can use for FX too.UOB PPV - max $1110 per calendar month  must mobile contactless (use phone in store to tap).Both cards earn 4mpd. Spend in $5 blocks. UNI$ earned pools together. PPV cannot use at UOB$ merchants  eg. Dairy Farm group.,btohqsg
Ah understood now. So giro is with bank acct and cardup does the payment earlier via my uob prvi setup. Thank u!!,btohqsg
And recommended to set up cardup payment like a week or more before iras deduction (6th every month). Iras will have enough time to process and not deduct from ur bank giro.,btohqsg
Did u participate June-Jul promo n transfer in on 01 June? If yes  can you check your statement?,btohqsg
Noted. Will set up giro now + cardup when I receive my prvi card for Aug's payment.,btohqsg
Just checked.1st June transfers. All captured under 1st June date in HSBC EGA statement.,btohqsg
In June statement or May statement?,btohqsg
June statement.My HSBC statement is not 1st to 1st.Nevertheless it shows under 1st June date entries.,btohqsg
Hope bank will follow what is stated in TnC that is based on calendar month.,btohqsg
So what u worried?Worst case u got 1 day higher reference month adb?Shouldn’t total loss?,btohqsg
Worst case is my transaction will be treated as May which I did not participated/registered. So only earn 0.05% in June because it is not fresh fund in June?,btohqsg
I see. Maybe u should check with HSBC live chat for your peculiar case on why you can see 1st June transaction in a May statement?I actually don’t think it’s serious especially if it is date stamped 1st June transaction. Which statement u see the transaction should not matter. What date it is recognised is what’s important.,btohqsg

yes i have it already. MAB on my UOB one is 5 digits,btohqsg
Then just top up to 150k.,btohqsg
I have set aside money for other bank acct,btohqsg
Was thinking how to utilise my current money in uob one to make it into fresh fund.,btohqsg
You need to understand how UOB define fresh fund. Usually ppl transfer all out in jun. Now it's too late to act,btohqsg
Fresh fund to HSBC EGA  fresh find to SCB eSaver  fresh fund to OCBC 360 account,btohqsg
On top of what others have suggested  remember to giro all credit cards bill to hsbc ega for an additional 1% cashback!,btohqsg
For fashion category  only online is counted. For retail  I don't recall. Better check their T&Cs. They have a very narrow criteria for retail  only selected brands iirc. Quite lousy.,btohqsg
On your caseFirst thing is Ega statement is not generated based on calendar month  it is not 1st to last day of the month.The date can be different for everyoneFor your scenario  I believe your statement happens to generate every month around 1st or 2nd  thus you feel your june transaction posted into May. But it is not  because EGA does not cut off the statement on last day of the month like all other banks.I think your funds posted on 1 June are very safe. Anyone please correct me if you have another opinion.,btohqsg
Hi  may I know how to check my account’s MAB? Is it stated in my account or have to self calculate? Sorry  am new to uob one account,btohqsg
Has anyone received a call from UOB recently claiming to have a savings product with better interest rate than UOB one account and the RM asked to meet at a UOB branch to explain more?,btohqsg
Based on last action.  Deposit date or form submission date. Whichever later,btohqsg
I went down yesterday to open a UOB one account and the staff was talking about a new savings plan (July oni) that they have to combine with the UOB one account. If you don't want to do the min spend of $500 can opt for the savings plan and there will be a min deduction of $500 per month (or was it $510  can't remember haha). The funds will be locked in for at least 10 years or 15 years(depending on what you choose).  The annual interest will be higher for the 15 years option. They mentioned that each outlet has different percentage as well?So if you choose 10 years  then they will deduct 500 per month  so 1 year like at least 6k. Then after 10 years with their annual interest rate will be a total of $68k (total of 8k interest for 10 years). This is just for the waterwaypoint branch UOB.,btohqsg
Am I right hsbc ega still need 5 transaction to qualify but they put new condition in July for funds to be deposited within 30 days so these flow out will have no interest not fair wor,btohqsg
Probably ask you get endowment plan,btohqsg
Recently I have got my 100k earmark came back from rising dragon promotion. I cannot just keep it in uob and should reset it for next promotion?,btohqsg
hi Chris  if btw CSPX and SPYL  would you have a preference which to go for? 😊,btohqsg
I see  thanks for sharing. I asked the RM to tell me more over the phone but he say cannot  to avoid scare of scams. But him not wanting to tell me more seemed more sus to me lol,btohqsg
It's a typical way of them setting appointment,btohqsg
Yeah does seem like it from the description above,btohqsg
68/60= 1.13. ie 13%. annualised will be 1.13%,btohqsg
To meet you and try sell you endowment plan,btohqsg
Please do note that these endowment's return is only projected. Only thing guaranteed I think is capital protected,btohqsg
Well guess he won’t be seeing me at the bank. Endowment is not smth im looking for. Have a great day folks,btohqsg
My parents & in-laws got calls from these RM as well being asked when they go to bank. I told them to call me if they asked you to buy anything,btohqsg
Ya but can’t fault them coz they just doing their job lah. I think more importantly they shouldn’t misrepresent the product or try to hard sell  esp to folks who may not be so financially literate and are not able to comprehend the product. I guess good that your parents can check in with you,btohqsg
UOB is partnering with Prudential to sell their insurance products. No such thing as ‘each outlet has different percentage’ lol,btohqsg
Sound like endowment plan to me haha,btohqsg
It is not capital guaranteed for first few years. A huge loss if cancelled during first few years.,btohqsg
They mentioned the percentage will be fixed no matter the outcome of the market or something. At that time the staff said 2-3% depending on the years.,btohqsg
Myself  SPYL for lower expense ratio. CSPX has been around much longer though.,btohqsg
I think u just put in uob one better.,btohqsg
Ahh icic. Yeah they didn't mention the prudential thing. Good to know😃,btohqsg

Not sure if anyone has asked before. I have reached 55 yo and still have money left in OA after RA created. Does it make sense to withdraw the money to pay the housing accrued interest? I am planning to upgrade my flat from 4 rm to 5rm as well. I have no outstanding HDB loan.,btohqsg
dont think got any difference since the accrued interest is at same rate as OA? not sure whats the difference,btohqsg
I think if I pay down the housing accrued interest  I will not owe myself the interest but start getting interest from CPF instead?,btohqsg
Or it actually makes no difference like u said.,btohqsg
because if u using cpf funds to pay back  think no difference since u gonna upgrade flat the net amount might be same  if u using cash funds to pay back the accrued interest it might be ok but that too not so good now since outside u get grow ur cash higher than the 2.5% rate that u are accruing,btohqsg

I don't think UOB CSO can be totally trusted. I chatted online with one  he said they are with the cards team so can't answer my qns. Redirected me to uob hotline. I called  the CSO told me he can't check if my latest deposit of 150k will qualify or not. He said to wait and if doesn't qualify  to call back again to chk/appeal. 😰 I also asked when will the funds be earmarked  he said 30th Aug. When I ask if my funds transfer in and out in June will affect the 150k fresh fund  he said my 150k should be OK... Doesn't sound convincing/sure at all!,btohqsg
"the problem is the new TNCs are rather new and the CSOs might not have been trained on how the system really implements it.As said  nobody has any actual DPs on this ""30 days before promo"" yet.",btohqsg
That is why I remind my parents to call me if these RM talked to them. But to be fair  I not saying the bank offerings are bad. For my parent savings  I helped them to put into UOB SimpleInvest to earn interest instead of leaving in the bank account.,btohqsg

Anyone still using amaze card for foreign currency purchases? I just used it linked with UOB krisflyer and the rate is much worse than using UOB krisflyer directly. Anyone else having similar experience? Is amaze still viable?,btohqsg
Are you sure using UOB KF direct is better?,btohqsg
your DIRECT uob krisflyer amount shown in UOB app... hasn't been marked up by 3.25% yet.,btohqsg
"Thanks. I did buy term plans to provide for them in case anything happens. Also bought hospital plans for my parents with my medisave as they don't believe in insurance. I use SimpleInvest as the amount invested/dividend can be seen on the UOB app along with their savings. It makes it easier for my parents to see ""everything"".",btohqsg
people dont believe in insurance until something happens to them,btohqsg
Agree.  This is the reason why I helped my parents and my wife to invest to earn passive income and the assets are under their name. The lump sum from term plan may helped for a while but the passive income will help them a long way in case.,btohqsg
Very sure  just a couple of minutes difference for comparison,btohqsg
I have used UOB krisflyer on Foreign currency many times previously  there is no separate charges for the 3.25%,btohqsg
She meant the posted amount will reflect 3.25% fee,btohqsg
U need to see final posted amt  it will vary from pending amt,btohqsg
Check again when it's posted and update us again :) Looking forward to your dp,btohqsg
Many people don’t know how FCY payments work. They just say good/bad exchange rate 😂,btohqsg
Riding on for some thoughts  will it be better to use CC directly despite the higher rates  since Amaze doesn't have that much protection against fraud compared to CC,btohqsg
depends on how u value miles,btohqsg
There is a risk for sure but not much higher than normal cc getting fraudulent charges. You can request for reversion with amaze if fraud too. A bit more hassle than ur bank but its possible.,btohqsg
without following 100% of all DP posts  i also want to remind people who are measuring Amaze spreads.In my opinion  the correct way to measure is:Amaze rate shown in Amaze App / Spot Rate (yahoo finance for example)I have been seeing people complaining Amaze spread is bad at 2.7%++ recently but i never encountered so bad UNLESS it is weekend.Weekdays my experience with USD  JPY  AUD is that it has always been below 2.5% TOTAL SPREAD  with most of the time being 2.25% ish (I did AUD 1-2 days ago and it was 2.1x%)https://t.me/milelion/969712,btohqsg
Agreed. Already done this comparison video last year amid all the YouTrip and Trust hype.https://youtu.be/y-yHZas1amMUpdate for 2024 soon (when paying at a big merchant overseas),btohqsg
how bad were people reporting amaze spread to be ?i read milelion's article spread seems to be around 2%,btohqsg
Anyone know when will the miles earn from Krisflyer UOB CC be credited?,btohqsg
2.7% I think a bit extreme,btohqsg
the confusion comes when mastercard/visa/amex rate is excluded from the equation.I believe a number of Milelion members use Amaze cost to be Amaze rate - Mastercard Rate. But because Mastercard Rate is often not as updated as Spot Rate (which is live)  the Amaze cost they measure might be different.Using Amaze Total Cost = Amaze rate - Spot Rate when you transactwould be most accurate in my opinion  although we had agreed to disagree (they said Spot Rate is not relevant because they are only comparing within CREDIT CARDS).,btohqsg
Last month can get from the app when you tap on the bonus interest. For this month  use Excel.#mabcalculator,btohqsg
Is it because their POV is using Amaze vs using CC? Hence comparing Amaze rates vs CC rates.Nonetheless  was the comparison of spread% much different than ur numbers?,btohqsg
OK i am now speaking from my limited understanding of 'their point of view'.From their point of view  the result on WHICH CREDIT CARD to use won't change  so no need to consider Spot Rate.From MY point of view  spot rates must be used in order easily compare Credit Cards  Debit Cards  and Cash payment methods.,btohqsg
Ive been receiving it on 4th every month.,btohqsg
So if I spend on 27june I should received it on 4th July which is tomorrow?,btohqsg
I agree with considering spot rate  especially if you hold existing cash of that foreign currency,btohqsg
Gamxia  was considering cause of ML’s experiencehttps://milelion.com/2022/01/29/not-so-amazing-my-experience-disputing-a-fraudulent-transaction-on-the-amaze-card/https://milelion.com/2022/04/11/psa-why-your-amaze-card-refund-wont-go-through/(I do note these are two years back though),btohqsg
Its the same now. I dont think anything has changed significantly.,btohqsg
I check before as well.I have both KF card and amaze card.when I compare with Google rate  Amaze card give lower Fx rate vs direct cc. Amaze was about 2.5% spread while KF was 3-ish.,btohqsg
that was before amaze introduce a bunch of nerf more recently (since June) . not sure if they screw the exchange rate or not.,btohqsg
The purpose of using uob krisflyer via Amaze is also to convert offline to online to get 3mpd under the online shopping category.,btohqsg
I guess it just comes down to how you personally compare it.But using spot rate vs mc/visa rate. Is it alot of difference between this 2?,btohqsg
So long it is a fair comparison i.e. spot with spot  visa/mc vs visa/mc  either way works,btohqsg
Just be reminded if you face problems with amaze  can be catastrophic. 😂Using vanilla credit card gives you a peace of mind for a little bit more. It’s like buying insurance.Only use 4mpd or 6mpd cards with amaze.,btohqsg
best rate is of course to use local currency put in amaze wallet without linking to credit card. I think it was 0.5% or something,btohqsg
Yes I also have this simpler mindset. Only swipe amaze if 4-6mpd cc,btohqsg
yes but no credit card rewards,btohqsg
hence pay 2.5% for the reward in cc,btohqsg
There are already trust/youtrip for that.,btohqsg
Does favepay and ShopBack count as online for CRMC?,btohqsg
Is there any comparison video from chris comparing trust/utrip/revo/amaze?,btohqsg
Thanks. I found the multi currency video but revo wasnt inside haha,btohqsg
on average i feel it is about 0.7-0.8% difference.The main issue i feel is Master/Visa/Amex rates are only updated a few times a day  so you may not be getting the real spread (could work in your favour or disadvantage).For example if the real spot rate is 120 for SGD/JPY now  but mastercard is delayed and only giving you 119  you lugi.Conversely if SGD/JPY is now 118  but mastercard hasn't adjusted and still giving you 119  you gain.,btohqsg
Revolut should be similar rate to trust/youtrip. Some minor differences in rate but not significant at our spending amount.,btohqsg
Spread charge from mc/visa is based on posting or trans date?,btohqsg
Does anyone have any actual experience transferring out more than SGD200k from IBKR recently?I would like to find out if IBKR would use another method to transfer the funds which could result in longer (not same day receipt) of funds if the amount is above SGD200k.So far  I have been keeping to under SGD200k and the SGD funds are always received on the SAME DAY i initiate the withdrawal (not sure if they use FAST or real TT).,btohqsg
Shld be 1 or 2 biz days. Transfer around that amount before. But not too sure is it under or above.,btohqsg
yes hence i suspect IBKR uses FAST for SGD transfers (and if more than SGD200k  it MIGHT no longer be using FAST).I am not sure.,btohqsg
Hi  this was my rate for TWD.Spot rate was about 23.98  so markup is about 2.6%  correct?,btohqsg
About there  but still cheaper then bank rate,btohqsg
i can't see the historical spot rate but using your figures23.367 / 23.98 = 2.56% markup (about the 2.5% that i usually use)Note that non major currencies like MYR  TWD  CNY  IDR typically will have higher spread  even master and visa!  compared to G10 currencies.,btohqsg
Is there a count down timer on this moomoo 6.8% promo similar to past promo?,btohqsg
To be considered new-to-bank again  do I need to wait 12 month since card cancellation?My particular Citi card was canceled xAug23. On my Credit Bureau report  it shows my account closed date xxSept23  which is at a later date.To be sure to be considered ntb for sign-up rewards  should I sign up after a day after I called in to cancel or follow the report's 'Date Closed',btohqsg
Best to check with bank CSO directly. 13 months to be safe,btohqsg
Anyone know if KrisShopper and KrisShop on the Kris+ app the same?There seems to be a separate loyalty programme on krisshopper,btohqsg
KrisShop via Kris+ can earn KrisPay miles.KrisShopper is the loyalty program,btohqsg
Have you folks heard of Revolut giving consistent 5.4% APR return,btohqsg
That’s better than anything in the market,btohqsg
It's not guaranteed return as far as I can tell,btohqsg
It’s not guaranteed but quite consistent from what I saw (I had put 15k with them  and getting daily returns),btohqsg
So that is an investment with risk. The returns may not be consistent or there could be loss of capital in events like market downturn.,btohqsg
Ya its mmf. Investment  not saving account. The risk is higher. Plus it seems only in USD. Exchange rate fluctuation can be a concern too.,btohqsg
Low risk not no risk 🤪,btohqsg
actually is medium risk due to it being USD,btohqsg
Make sense. Higher risk higher returns. As long we go in with eyes open,btohqsg
Yes  not recommended to change SGD into USD for this.Though for those with idle USD in Revolut  this may be a fussfree and relatively low risk way to pick up some yield. It’s actually the same thing as the various brokerages’ (e.g. Tiger  MooMoo  Webull) cash sweep vehicles.,btohqsg
Now there is an effort to de-dollarization on USD  so we dont know  where USD is heading towards. The forex risk is there. My view is countries may dump USD dollars but US customers will be majority of the buyers with purchasing power for now so they still have to accept USD dollars.,btohqsg
Something interesting i noted.One of my UOB cards had $2.50 of spending in the cycle and even though UOB App stated $2.50 was due by my usual statement due date  the Card and $2.50 never appeared anywhere in my Card Statements.I just noticed it and just paid. Hope all ok.,btohqsg
For UOB lady bonus point (card spend) when will they credit?,btohqsg
I got the lady saving account but doesn’t see the x9 point,btohqsg
Card spend bonus comes in on 1st working day of following calendar month  lady's account bonus comes in 27th of following calendar month,btohqsg
Card spend is x9 or x5 for eligible spend,btohqsg
supposed to be 9X by calculation but in the app it says 5X,btohqsg
the 5X i see is from savings bonus. Card spend bonus don't specify how many X  only says Lady's Card UNI$,btohqsg
Omg why I don’t see lady card UNI,btohqsg
Wow I’m not seeing that credited to me at all and I did chose the correct category,btohqsg
How long have u had the card? What cat did you choose?,btohqsg
But previously I got lady card and not solitaire,btohqsg
So I got two . I sus the system locks my lady card,btohqsg
i think upgrade in categories only take effect in new quarter. You better double check with CSO.,btohqsg
Yeah I double check it before,btohqsg
Is it possible for Cso to refund miles?,btohqsg
That's for UOB to answer you haha,btohqsg
As in if yall have any experience,btohqsg
When did u get approved for lady sol? And have you been receiving miles for basic lady?,btohqsg
Mid June   and yes I have been receiving miles for basic lady,btohqsg
You won’t receive bonus miles for your second category for spending in June,btohqsg
That new category only comes into effect July  which is the start of a new quarter,btohqsg
Cso told me solitaire will supersede normal lady in June,btohqsg
Only the limit of $2000. Categories come into effect quarterly only,btohqsg
So if my normal lady is travel in June and if my solitaire when I apporve I put dining and fashion,btohqsg
https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/faqs-final.pdfWhat happens when I upgrade my UOB Lady’s Classic/ Platinum/ World Mastercard to UOB Lady’s Solitaire Card?Please visituob.com.sg/ladys-enrolto choose TWO (2) of your preferred rewards categories. This will take effect the next calendar quarter. However  you may start enjoying the higher cap of S$2 000 spend based on your existing chosen ONE (1) preferred rewards category in the calendar month of your card upgrade.,btohqsg
Bonus miles only for travel related spend in June. Dining and fashion from July onwards  unfortunately,btohqsg
And I spend on my solitaire   it is dining fashion or travel,btohqsg
You don't get any bonus for your spending on dining and fashion in June,btohqsg
oh myyyyy I called CSO and he said can,btohqsg
The card will take over  the limit will change  just not the categories,btohqsg
DId you take a screenshot/recording of what CSO said to you?  If you did  maybe can try to appeal but if not  then too bad.,btohqsg
I now got UOB lady N UOB solitaire should I cancel my UOB lady?,btohqsg
I thought for TWD  it is better to get from money changer as their rate is better at 24.50 compared to youtrip  amaze  Ichange etc?,btohqsg
Yall more reliable than CSO sia,btohqsg
Rely on tncs better than CSO,btohqsg
There's a lot of dp here on UOB CSOs  read t&c better. On black and white  the outcome can be better but cannot be worse.,btohqsg
It should be cancelled automatically. But if not  you can just do the cancellation via the UOB app.Also  take note of the expiry month of your solitaire card. That’ll be the month your annual fees are charged so you wanna be careful about your Uni$,btohqsg
Can advice me on this  I didn’t upgrade I applied solitaire hence I got two card,btohqsg
For the citi bank smrt card  is using apple pay to tap at the gantry to enter MRT eligible for cashback? Or must I use the physical card?,btohqsg
is the citi rewards + instarem combo the best for general spend or is there a better card out there ?,btohqsg
How do I check my UOB solitaire category ?,btohqsg
Think there’s a chat bot you can check with,btohqsg
Can any master advice how much in total is the surrender value for this?,btohqsg
Yes if your spending is below 1k. And dont buy travel tix.,btohqsg
about 4 225.75 - fees and non guaranteed amount,btohqsg
Ic.. So those bonus alr inclusive,btohqsg
what is not detailed in your screenshot.. is the SURRENDER FEE/CHARGE,btohqsg
Does CIMB really have this fixed deposit plan?,btohqsg
Current grosssurrender value is in your screenshot  about 4.2k.Product summary and benefit illustration will tell you more info on your guaranteed and non-guaranteed bonuses. As well as the fees.,btohqsg
it is likely a STRUCTURED DEPOSIT,btohqsg
and they are 'eating' you on year 1.5 to 2.5...you only get 3% p.a. on $300k,btohqsg
Hi Chris@ChrisHMSG  may I check if longbridge have any MMF to subscribe to? else 90 days $$ standing there  is not productive,btohqsg
Ohh ok! Tks for the reply  just worried it is a scam or something.,btohqsg
it is not a scam... it is likely one of those where once you start  you cannot get out early without taking a large loss,btohqsg
Don't seem like fixed deposit. Not covered under SDIC. Capital guaranteed only if the bank still exists. 🤣I help you calculate  it's 2.25% p.a EIR. Better to just leave it in Maribank  GXS bank and other fixed deposits. 🤪,btohqsg
Didn't realise that maribank also got their own plunging chicken promo.,btohqsg
Plunging chicken but very mild version,btohqsg
Hi  I’m planning to go travel. If I’m already spend more than $1000 using Citi + Amaze. What card should I use next?I’m planing with UOB KrisFlyer + Amaze? Will this help me earns 3 mile per dollars (I have spent $800 on SIA),btohqsg
The interest rate reduced ah? Or got new news,btohqsg
Short answer to your qn  yes. Long answer to your qn yeeeeeessssssssssssIf you have UOB Lady's that is better in the selected cats if not UOB Krisflyer + Amaze shd give u that 3mpd uncapped,btohqsg
No la. Earmark promo. Since Feb.No need to be fresh funds  as long the money is in the bank  can just earmark.3 months earmark  $40 cash credit for $50k  but EIR only 3.02% p.a. 🤣,btohqsg
Hi  I’m sorry if this is a basic question. If my SSB next payout date is 1 Aug 2024  with next payout amount of $100  if I were to redeem it early (for example  today 3 July)  will I receive a prorated payout for 1 Aug (less than $100)  or I will not receive any payout at all?Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Amaze no limit for fx spend.,btohqsg
Yes there is Fullerton SGD Cash Fund MMF.Note that Buy trades must be Stock/ETF only,btohqsg
It looks to me return is not at a guaranteed rate but only capital guaranteed. It means your deposit of 300k can get zero return as a guaranteed result unless the shop closed. It is not a fixed deposit.,btohqsg
Us dedollarization will take many years but I do think at these prolonged high interest rates  usd will depreciated vs sgd,btohqsg
Guys just FYI I have joined JHsbc ega July promotion  asked customer service and they said only sms is activated the everyday bouns already. I didnt do 5 transactions. As I am aware it only count fresh funds and any funds out of the account within 30days will be count as non fresh hence no point to do such 5x deduction anymore. Correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg

Hi  may I ask if purchasing Taka vouchers fulfills the qualifying spend criteria?,btohqsg
The wording quite ‘tricky’. It’s not stated that the promo is a fixed deposit  but that it is a promo which a lot of people that’s doing fixed deposit are interested in  giving the impression that it’s similar. My guess is it’s an endowment (similar to Income Gro Capital  Singlife Secure Saver etc.).The $2250 for $100k and $9000 for $200k are paid out at end Dec 2024 and end Jun 2025 respectively? Or at the end of 2.5 years?If former  EIR is 3.7% p.a.If latter  EIR is 3.62% p.a.,btohqsg
Hi all need some help for a new credit card noob here.I just recently applied for the citi rewards + amaze combo.I am a little confused as I have read mixed updates.If I were to go to gaincity tomorrow and use the Amaze + citi combo to pay via the physical Amaze card  would I still eligible for the 10x points?Also does it really convert all amaze transactions to online tansactions making it fool proof to just use the amaze card for all daily expenses such as food and grocery shopping maximizing the rewards?,btohqsg
Yes and yes. Take note of the 1k limit for Amaze domestic spend though  there’s 1% charge beyond the 1k.,btohqsg
it specifically said capital is guaranteed. It didnotsay return or interest is guaranteed.As SDIC only guarantees $100k  hence  $300k of capital guarantee at the end of 2.5 years obviously is not come from SDIC.,btohqsg
Hi all  for the uob lady's card. If I'm picking a new reward category today (no prior changes in the current quarter) is the change effective immediately? Or is there a waiting period?,btohqsg

I just got the uob lady's solitaire.  it's a new card while i still have normal lady's card in hand. Are they able to earn miles together? Or just bound to 2000 solitaire limit only,btohqsg
Hi anyone know if there is a new cask back card in July,btohqsg
2k spend limit for bonus miles,btohqsg
Just max 2k for bonus categories,btohqsg
That means i should only use solitaire for travel spend from oct onward...,btohqsg
New categories take effect next quarter.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if those restaurants with qr code menu and payment  if i use apple pay and select crmc  will it consider as online?,btohqsg
Yeah... My current cat is on dining,btohqsg
Why not wait for OP to share more on the product before jumping to conclusions?In any case  Capital guaranteed here does not refer to SDIC. It’s just another way of saying premature surrendering the policy will result in principal loss  which is typically the case for endowments.Also to add  endowments are actually covered by SDIC under Policy Owners’ Protection Scheme. Though obviously if one is putting in $300k it won’t be fully covered due to the PPS cap.,btohqsg
You can double check using uob chat assist function.,btohqsg
Does any know what's the MCC for Shell or Petronas fuel station in JB?,btohqsg
Searched the chat it seems that if paired CC with Amaze  need to tap at the counter instead of petrol kiosk?,btohqsg
Amaze not working at kiosk  need pay at the counter,btohqsg
Tell staff you want to pump first  after pump finish  go in counter pay 1 shot.I kenna BBQ few times because I use the kiosk. Will regret it. Amaze charged me 10%+ instead of 2%+.,btohqsg
Will vomit blood and die on the spot.My friend who paid $2k+ hotel also kenna. And no way amaze will recognise why it happened. 😂Suay lo. Lucky mine is pump petrol for motorbike 🤣Wanted to find out what happened but no way amaze gonna tell.Don’t use at kiosk insert card  die die pay at the counter inside so there is no reversal or refund.Oh amaze a lot effort  called me 10-20times to ask me close case and explain from their script for 10-20times. Just totally avoided my question why 10% 🤯🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
Question :Got Amex krisflyer Classic ( Blue) and I applied for Egiro with HSBC EGA   got an SMS confirming the addition of Amex to Giro into HSBC  I have a bill for 12th July  how I ll know it will be deducted by Giro ? The Bill doesn't say anything a part from the date of paying,btohqsg
dun use apple pay in-app  it is excluded from 10x points on crmc. Likely considered online if use crmc directly on the restaurant app,btohqsg
if bill dun indicated payment via giro  then start next statement,btohqsg
hi  pls can someone explain to me how HSBC ega works? there’s a promo now that offers bonus 3.55% on the incremental ADB  so for a new acct my month of July will earn total 3.60%  but then in Aug the EIR on whole sum will be less alr right?,btohqsg
For me. I submitted to DBS.1 letter to inform they have initiated the process of giro.1 more letter later on to confirm that giro is in effect & accepted.,btohqsg
also  without the promo  what int rates does ega give?,btohqsg
That makes zero sense. All they gave were boilerplate replies.Probably too late for you Feb24 case  but if it ever happens again  use the rates shown in Mastercard FX calculator to dispute them.,btohqsg
They just said at that moment  it’s the best rates. And said they are the best in market. And keep repeating.,btohqsg
And when I complaint to my friends. A few of them swear to never use amaze lol 😂Mine was quite small issue. But theirs was much much bigger issue and cannot solve it.Yes I’m still using amaze  but very careful.,btohqsg
Hmmm. My personal experience with Amaze usage is ok so far  though I agree their customer service is CMI most of the time 😅,btohqsg
I pray everything smooth smooth only. Lucky no more big transactions with amaze liao after lady card got nerf.,btohqsg
Yup  main use case for me is local spend on CRMC 😂,btohqsg
Yes for adding DBS altitude into HSBC I got the letter from DBS  but for AMEX I got only SMS   but I often chose full bill   I see that they show min 50 dollar so maybe it is not added into HSBC   although the SMS confirm that,btohqsg
Update  amaze can link back to UOB masters  working now,btohqsg

Planning to apply for UOB PRV to start with   any preference between Visa or Master card ? Maybe the latter can be paired with Amaze ( I guess for FX optimisation  not sure about offline to online Transaction conversion)   what u guys recommend ?,btohqsg
yes i think so..it is tracked for mine,btohqsg
Visa is preferred. Keep amaze for your 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
they gave me a lump sum  so unsure about this :(,btohqsg

Unlikely to be endowment. More like structured deposits  which is an more like an investment plan. 100% not covered by SDIC.,btohqsg
What gave u the impression that this is a structured deposit?,btohqsg
Does CIMB offer short term endowments?,btohqsg
Bancassurance is quite common i.e. banks using its sales channel to sell policies for insurance firms that it partners with. I recall CIMB promoted Singlife endowments previously. Not sure if it still does.Again  I'm curious why so many felt it's a structured deposit rather than an endowment.,btohqsg
Maybe you are right. Sounds like Singlife Flexi Life Income II. Bit like Endowment/Annuity plan  and there are others who received similar calls/texts from CIMB.Which will 100% be covered be SDIC.,btohqsg
"I'm pretty new hereI paid USD 25.50 with amaze linked to credit card  and the charge on my  credit card is sgd35.36Is this exchange rate ""reasonable""?",btohqsg
It is subjective. First you need to calculate the spread between your transaction's rate and the spot rate. Then you use the spread to minus against the rewards you earn from you credit card. If you end up with a positive return  there ya go,btohqsg
What’s the transaction date? Typically Amaze should be around Mastercard FX rate + 1.9%.,btohqsg
What’s the best card to use for overseas spending in Europe? TIA,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
It seems hsbc EGA eligibility is 2 months now? My sms said till 31 aug.,btohqsg
It feels more like a Structured Product/Deposit now rather than Endowment because CIMB has (deliberately?) not made any mention of insurance element.That aside  whether it is Principal Protected Structured Product/Deposit or Endowment would have rather similar risk/liquidity features.Both are indeed 100% principal protected by the Issuer/Insurer if held till maturity. Both will pay guaranteed (and sometimes non guaranteed interest/benefit).,btohqsg
Isn’t that just mis selling tho,btohqsg
that is why they usually 'invite you to branch' where they then tell you the full info.i guess because there is a stigma of insurance.... people hear.. oh i don't want to buy insurance.. don't even want to go down branch.,btohqsg
It has also not made any mention of any linkages to investment elements (e.g. interest rates  FX rates) that is fairly typical of structured deposits. Still don’t see why the little info provided makes it more likely to be a structured deposit.,btohqsg
maybe the 3 periods of 'deposit placement'30 months24 months12 months,btohqsg
No leh  that’s also a variant of single premium endowments where the premium is split over a few periods,btohqsg
Insurance products aren’t actually bad tho haha,btohqsg
The products usually will only get better over time because the industry is so competitive haha.,btohqsg
yeah but that's when they upfront say.. Manulife... Singlife.. whatever..then people 'insurance light bulb' turns on.when you go DBS or OCBC or CIMB bank... the officer tell you.. eh put money now  6 months later  18 months later  it sounds more like a bank product right?this i guess is what we are trying to say  them camouflaging it as much as possible as a 'safer' bank product instead of the unpopular 'insurance' product where people switch off the moment they hear the trigger word insurance.,btohqsg
actually i think the core product/offering remains the same..it is just how they package or sell or camouflage it,btohqsg
Bancassurance also similar leh. They’ll try to sell single premium endowments as if they are fixed deposits,btohqsg
yeah interesting I THINKinsurance products with cash value (covered by SDIC/PPF).. actually have MORE regulatory protection than NON DEPOSIT bank products like structured products (SDIC won't cover),btohqsg
But common for people to be misled and buy from bank cause they think it’s safer to buy from a bank,btohqsg
Scb c.card application fail  becoz I have trust card? Yesterday they called me ask something related with trust's credit limit😌,btohqsg
Odd. What did you do with ur trust card?,btohqsg
they mentioned the credit limit is share among their banks,btohqsg
Yes the credit limit is shared but it shouldn't cause ur rejection.,btohqsg
But now with July promotion any withdrawal fund doesn't count as fresh funds anymore so if you get any giro outflow it won't earn 1% everyday bouns at all. Then what's the point to giro out at all?,btohqsg
Giro is giro as stated before  the cashback is seperate pool for giro and incremental fund.U can dont have incremental fund in hsbc ega and dont earn the incremental 1 percent for fresh fund. But u still earn 1 percent for whatever bill that is giro out from hdbc ega.,btohqsg
Yes so for me it's no point because it just take away my fresh fund loose the interest I am earning then u rather no giro out,btohqsg
I really dont get u  i not even sure if u are using the term giro in the way it is suppose to be. As long as any bill is giro from hsbc ega u get 1 percent. It does not mean u have to keep the fund for giro in there all the time. Just transfer in on deduction date,btohqsg
Giro is one time setup to pay your recurring bills. Once it's set up  you need to keep money in HSBC ega to pay no? Then just do ega 5 trnx thing to get 1%.,btohqsg
OK let me try to summarise. When u have incremental fund in the hsbc ega account  it will get 1% bouns to the everyday reward programme. But from July promotion  they have added a requirement that only fresh funds has no withdrawal within 30days will qualify.So if you have 100k in the account that earn 4.6% (1% +3.6%). Then when you have any giro out it will not qualify for the 1% interest. You maybe say you can input more money to pay this bill but on top do not withdraw another 30 days to keep it same.,btohqsg
we still do not know how they will enforce the stupid tnc.but you are right if they enforce it 100% as worded. You will lose interest on any funds withdrawn and put back again (even though it might be different money).This should be what Yammy is saying:1st July have $300k fresh funds (earn good interest)5th July  have GIRO out $10k to pay whatever bills.6th July  Yammy moves in $5k money. HSBC MAY enforce the 30 days fresh fund rule and still only pay good interest on $290k (300-10) fresh funds. The $5k is excluded.The above is how the TNC is  if strictly enforced. BUT i don't think they will do it so strict as it doesnt make sense.,btohqsg
I think we are talk about different thing. I am just saying just do 5 transaction so the giro bill keep getting 1 percent while u are so insistent on the fresh fund on saving acct,btohqsg
It should not even be a issue as hsbc ega is use as a rotating account,btohqsg
Yea exactly this makes me ask customer service about it and they only tell me I qualify already with a sms no need 5 transaction out. Very annoying thou,btohqsg
i can tell you.. the HSBC customer service also don't know how HSBC will do it.,btohqsg
i already make 5 fund transfer to non hsbc (fast) but i didnt get any sms. so in order to get 1% we need to get the sms?,btohqsg
I think this new rule of 30 days no withdrawal to qualify as fresh funds then I rather no giro to keep it clean. I just manual pay my bills first.,btohqsg

Maybe she dont have bill as much as us.,btohqsg
OK This is PURELY MY GUESS (i will not take responsibility for my guess  use it with pinch of salt).HSBC is including this 30 days fresh fund treatment clause (which SCB all along has but never enforce) just to scare/discourage people from rotating money to maximise HSBC EGA rewards.HSBC will not have the system capability to differentiate between genuine fresh funds or recycled fresh funds if you move money in from outside HSBC (don't do stupid things like HSBC A to HSBC B  that is like DUH!).So I think we are just scaring ourselves and it will still all be ok. (Repeat: PURELY MY GUESS ONLY).,btohqsg
I mean I'd rather get 1% paying GIRO with HSBC  then 3.5% p.a. fuss free in CIMB  I defo get more $ overall,btohqsg
i already sent the sms on 14 June. received sms on register the jun ega promotion on the same day. but i only top up the ega funds and do the 5 transactions on July 2024. Please advise,btohqsg
This is not a fair comment  and i don't think we should be bashing anybody based on size. It is also a matter of theory.Anyway  if you put $360k fresh funds into HSBC EGA  and you have in/out for genuine investment needs and put back the money as fresh funds into HSBA EGA  the amount at risk is:360 000 x 0.036 / 12 = SGD1 080 of bonus interestThis is more than the max $500 GIRO benefit.,btohqsg
EGA acct needs 5 transactions thou. Unless all 5 are cc spends.,btohqsg
I gave alternative for 3.5% p.a. fuss free  CIMB accts,btohqsg
on the ega 1% interest as i dont get the sms,btohqsg
And I think the saga/arguments we have here.. is EXACTLY WHAT HSBC WANTS...cast doubt and fear in our minds to prevent us from recycling,btohqsg
As long as u do the transaction it is fine  hsbc know to either done send out the message or send it out late,btohqsg
well if you do HSBC EGA correctly  you get 4.6% troublesome interest + max $500 GIRO benefit.,btohqsg
Yea but given all the FUD I'm just presenting an alternative that is sure work one,btohqsg
Hsbc goes by adb for incremental fresh fund. The clause itself wont even make sense. Because let say u put 360k fresh fund on the last day of the promo month  doubt they gonna give u 360k interest in incremental,btohqsg
The sms can be sent as late as last week of the month.,btohqsg
U are confusing Everyday+ and EGA bonus interest. These are two different programs.,btohqsg
but they will send the sms to confirm eligible for the 1%?,btohqsg
got one month system error.. nobody received..but generally should get the SMS one.. and each SMS lasts for 2 cycles.,btohqsg
This month’s SMS is in. I did on 1st Jul.HSBCSG (1/2): You've qualified for the HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme! From now until 31AUG2024  enjoy 1% Cashback on eligible debit card spends and,btohqsg
Yea lor becomes average daily balance minus all outflow basically,btohqsg
Not confused they eat up my everyday bouns programme if I want the giro. I do think the two programme now has a offset on the outflow amount,btohqsg
The wording u are using is confusing.,btohqsg
HSBC system is lousy one.Don’t believe they can do it,btohqsg
Yea maybe u can use a better wording.,btohqsg
Just ADB minus off total outflow from account for the 1% bah. Easy to calculate for them. annoying is they only keep changing rules and this only applies to new July promotion in July August period not the others,btohqsg
Is it  the credit limit is shared among banks?,btohqsg
Actually what I worry now is 20th June I have a giro of 20k  the 2nd July I put in 300k. Do I get interest on 280k  or worse case 0$,btohqsg
Basically I try to simply to say I just want to max my 300sgd bouns for hsbc ega (yes I already run it since April at 2 human account) but if I just target this 300sgd bouns  once I have any giro on top I will reduce this amount and then get back in giro 1% rate. To me it's confusing. Yes. I don't have better wording. These 2 programme are on the same account but rules contradict on the outflow. If they really prefer people don't send money out within 30 days  then why ask people to set giro and also run 5 transactions.,btohqsg
It is not so easy because how are they going to prove the $5k in transferred in on 6th July is the same money as the $10k that went out on 5th July.Can kenna law suit or Mas complaint one.,btohqsg
I would recommend just do your normal things. If really kenna interest loss  then stop HSBC EGA Loh.Because all of us now are also guessing.,btohqsg
Oh no need to prove its same money or not. So if it is only saying the fresh funds cannot withdraw within 30day ma  so just deduct all the money ever outflow from the account from the average daily balance ok already,btohqsg
The rule of no withdrawal of 30days not guessing.But the effect indeed it seems is  if u want to use it for giro purely 1% back.Or u want to just use it for 4.6% interest.Looks like now cannot have both like before. I agree preciously can have 4.6% on top 1% on giro portion,btohqsg
Maybe other expert have better knowledge how hsbc ega handle the fresh funds rule,btohqsg
Cool. Thanks UOB 🥰Fall below fee -$5 waived!,btohqsg
I would think the most important line in the tnc is the adb compare to the reference month. It just dont make sense when u afraid that they wipe u off the fresh fund interest when giro occur,btohqsg
Hi all. Would like to ask. Singsaver or moneysmart? Which one is faster and easier processing the welcome gift  ex. Ipad.  I believe both will take 5mos.,btohqsg
If u are concern  u can always earn interest on the giro amt in other acct then transfer in on deduction date,btohqsg
Heard moneysmart is faster but I've only used singsaver  and you're right is about 5months,btohqsg
Since u use singsaver the reward procdsud is how,btohqsg

Hi all. Just received a call from UOB CSO. They mentioned that the amt i deposited in 1st Jul is not eligible for UOB nations of savers as i have withdrawn the funds on 1st Jun.So i guess its time to shift funds out of UOB and prep for the next quarterly promoTL;DR Uob enforce 30 days clause,btohqsg
I used the chat bot (Live CSO).,btohqsg
Enjoy your holiday and forget about all these MCC. Last you want is your MCC become monkey 🙉 and you stressed.,btohqsg
I only believe after trying haha. See whether the system can enforce anot. At worst get 4 percent p.a interest then,btohqsg
WLWLWLBBQLI put on 2nd July. Withdrawn on 1st Jun. Can still argue but eventually UOB should win because 1st July promo period date die die won’t change. It’s like National Day is 9 August  how to change?,btohqsg
Weird. Both my wife & myself waive can leh. But we did few days ago liao.,btohqsg
But 0.58% is on a few 100's of k  the 1% is on a few hundreds or thousands only... But for me  I won't completely do away with giro.Yammyif you are so concerned about the 1% bonus interest  just put your money with other banks and keep minimum balance in hsbc to get 1% cashback on all giro payments... I don't understand why you need to die die pair this 2 together... It can be separated as what others have suggested earlier.,btohqsg
Yeah. Thats my plan also. Haha. But this 1 dont think cso is wrong. Anyway i will empty out before sep,btohqsg
U cant completely wipe out for the whole month as money will go in and out with salary requirement and other stuff,btohqsg
As in u contacted them to confirm on eligibility for the promo and this is the call back response?,btohqsg
Yup. 1st call on mon cso say i eligible.then cso realise mistake so called me back earlier today to update,btohqsg
Haha not surprise bank being calculative. Usually not easy to earn extra $$ from bank,btohqsg
Hi  just to check if you have requested for a call back to confirm if your deposit amt on 1 Jul will qualify for e promo? Which channel did you do that? I called their hotline the CSO told me they won't know if my deposit is eligible or not... 😰,btohqsg
Tnc is there in writing  the programing into the system is doable but guess will be a tough task.So the best guess is if amt got earmark or not when the time come after registration,btohqsg
Agree. Unfortunately will need to wait until end of Aug to know... If the info given by CSO is correct.,btohqsg
Worst is get 4 percent p.a loh  not bad still. Earmark promo is bonus anyway.Dont think too much into it.,btohqsg
can amaze pair with hsbc revolut? since they removing contactless payment for bonus miles,btohqsg
Then hor. Christmas they come up with only new accounts are eligible 😂Then those people empty on September flip again! 🙉🤯😬,btohqsg
Wont lah  u cant be keep opening new acct and closing it. Will be a admin hazard for uob,btohqsg
Money smart seems to improve slightly. My whole process took around 3month,btohqsg

hello gurus. i saw the dbs altitude sign up promo. However  theres two option of DBS altitude amercian express and DBS altitude visa where the former can earn up to 60k miles and the latter 53k miles. both spending 3k. Which is a better choice because though the american express one can get higher miles  i heard AMEX is not widely accepted. PLease advice,btohqsg
Visa is a safer option. More worth than 7k miles signup difference.,btohqsg
7k miles is about 100 dollars? means till now AMEX is still widely not accepted? thank you =),btohqsg
Ya. In Singapore and around SEA/east Asia. Visa version has a use case for cardup later too.,btohqsg
understood. thanks for the advice =)  because im gonna sign up and purchase an ipad pro which alr cost 2k. so 1k remaining im thinking will it be a too high of a risk to take to yolo to go for AMEX HAHA,btohqsg

I just started using HSBC card online again (stopped for long time) and today was surprised on how HSBC does it. Yeah it is HSBC Live+.No more SMS OTP (yeah this is normal).But the merchant page actually pauses at the authentication screen and requires the card holder to LOGIN TO HSBC APP  not just open the app or have an app popup  but you need to LOGIN to the HSBC APP.After card holder logins to hsbc app  then you will see the popup asking you to authorise the payment.No phone popup  no app notification  UNLESS you login to the app.,btohqsg
Every time purchase have to login? Hows the card so far btw  thinking if i shld apply,btohqsg
Yeah abit weird compared to how the local banks does it,btohqsg
No cannot! Use ntuc voucher also can,btohqsg
I apologize for my dumb question but somehow quite urgent. What’s the best way to set up giro to pay personal tax from my UOB one account?,btohqsg
Are u asking if u wanna use with cardup?Cause setting up giro is pretty straight forward if u see the app,btohqsg
Urgent as in need immediate payment by today or...?Cause it looks like u are trying to setup GIRO  that which u would need to use the site,btohqsg
I actually prefer it this way. Use app to authenticate.Citibank also right?,btohqsg
GG liao… too late. I paid for my cardup liao… I think need to call DBS to ask soon…. 🥲🥲🥲,btohqsg
i did a pizza order online  and it trigger 3DS and it was in the form i just described.So my guess is all merchants that use 3DS will be this form.I am loving HSBC Live+ so far. I think it is relatively easy to use and I am using it for Dining and Departmental Store.I am pushing out Dining and Department Store spending from my UOB Lady Cards so I have more of the $2k quota for UOB Lady Travel and Groceries categories.,btohqsg
You can still earn miles but no sub,btohqsg

Not sure if I have time for that my tax deadline is July 6,btohqsg
Oh you are paying rent with cardup?,btohqsg
Thanks! Given that many of this method will take a few working days to be approved and that my deadline to pay tax is July 6  do you think it’s better I just pay the entire amount rather than giro? Quite concerned about any late fees,btohqsg
Urgent as I have a tax payment deadline on July 6,btohqsg
Think IRAS website can pay directly (No rewards),btohqsg
not sure if you started paying  can you still start the 12 months interest free instalment thingy,btohqsg
Yes  but then need to pay the entire amount?,btohqsg
Best to check w IRAS via Live chat about this (or email),btohqsg
Yep  for my own convenience  I usually use mobile app with biometric login enabled to approve the transaction seamlessly.,btohqsg
ok i think IRAS can discuss one.. Key is to get in touch with someone officially.Why not you call IRAS now (i think still office hours). Tell them honestly and see what they say,btohqsg
Ya. First time I do also blur. It’s not easy for first timer.,btohqsg

When does your next quarter start?,btohqsg
Doesn’t make sense to me because if I make the change to dining travel and system record as dining travel   it shld persists until I make another changesApparently it is not  she said there was a system change and the system captures a change to dining fashion today (so coincidental??!),btohqsg

Is the new UOB promo worth it with 5 months lock in ? 🤭,btohqsg
Approx 5.6% pa for 5.5 months lock-in.Also has the same danger clauses as HSBC EGA fyi.,btohqsg
At least u know if no earmark u u miss it instead of hsbc u wont really know until interest time,btohqsg
I think joining this UOB Promo is quite risky because UOB may half way cut the 4% interest to lower..,btohqsg
Another risk is any change of clause  the fund is locked for 5 months n cannot run away. Eg. Downward adjustment of interest  salary from company only  spend requirement increase  etc…,btohqsg
anyone can verify that ocbc365 card don't earn cashback on fast food mcc? I just went their website and got their latest t and c (dated March 2024) and it says it's included,btohqsg

Appealed successfully so lasted till now.. Then now received this after emptying out my account last week.. Damn funny..,btohqsg
What did you do to your account ? 😱. You musical chair it?,btohqsg
Ya as per previously mentioned 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Guys is it true that citi credit card can be paid via dbs pay bill function now?,btohqsg
"Ok la ""i asked for it"" since i still empty out after the previous letter and successful appeal",btohqsg
You mean after warning  you continue playing the musical game?,btohqsg
I saw the citi credit card option under dbs bill payment today,btohqsg
But i see no reason why i should just parked my money like a good kid with them if i cant musical chair n get the most benefits out of it,btohqsg
I guess they just gave u a reason,btohqsg
So they stop your musical chair  coz they see no benefit to keep you as their customer loh😂,btohqsg
Which to me is not a reason. I dont mind losing them n they dun mind losing me so i just find it funny,btohqsg
ok  just move on then. No need think about it since it doesn't matter to u.,btohqsg
Which just brings me back to the very origin of my initial photo post here. Dont go extreme musical chair if u mind being force closed by them. I am the example they shot down,btohqsg
I think the issue is that once u are shut it leave a record and most likely cant open with them again  even if good opportunity come up,btohqsg
Yours is not musical chair leh. This is once a month thereabouts.If I’m not wrong based on what u said yours is almost daily shifting to play cutoff timings.,btohqsg
"Which is why i dont play ""punk"" with dbs/posb. Still need a bank for normal daily life transactions",btohqsg
I have never mentioned daily shifting. At most its 3 to 4 times a month. Cutoff timings played on weekends when i remember. But quarterly month end is a definite.,btohqsg
Guess bank view u as a customer who play system and dont bring enough benefit to them to tolerate your behaviour lol😂.Dont think they will shut a private banking customer even if there is huge in and out monthly as long as source is legit,btohqsg
Very true again. Well said 👍,btohqsg
At least u dun jump to conclusions lol,btohqsg
U empty to zero inside? Or at least just leave $1k inside  I think they won't close the ac,btohqsg
Only earn for 5814 through delivery apps.,btohqsg
Empty to zero.. And it was a dumb move because i forgot i got 3 giro for the uob one acct n i was charged fees n i lost money,btohqsg
Wasn't it nerfed to 0.25% for 5814 last year?,btohqsg
They tarik back after few months they nerfed it  but maybe only for 5814 through delivery apps. So directly in shop payment with 5814 cannot  through apps like Deliveroo ok.,btohqsg
Where do u see that? The live T&C states that 5% for 5814 is only for Foodpanda  Grabfood and Deliveroo.https://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tncs-365cc-cashback-programme.pdf,btohqsg
Yup already edited my message before you sent lol. But I guess they didn't tarik anything. The faq got state delivery apps not changed. 😬,btohqsg
hey all thanks for clarification! 1 more question is that does fast food still count for the $800 spend? I'm struggling to hit that tbh lol,btohqsg
Yes  still counts towards min spend,btohqsg
OK awesome thanks! new to the credit card game lol,btohqsg
This letter there is no sentence or paragraph stating that it allows appeal,btohqsg
what is this group actually for?,btohqsg
Stupid stupid stupid. Trying to gain every advantage and then kena $20 like that 🤦🤦🤦,btohqsg
So for all those who saw the videos pls just follow chris recommendation of only moving once every quarterly n dont take it to the extreme like me. The consequence is drastic.,btohqsg
Once a month rotate is fine.Most importantly be able to provide kyc information when asked by bank.,btohqsg
lol weren’t you the one that account closure and then appeal?,btohqsg
Lol probably on their radar liao yet you still choose to do the same,btohqsg
But if i cant maximise it then i see no point still having the acct so i made the decision,btohqsg
Uob one acct is definitely a keeper in my view with all the promo and good card so i wont risk it lol,btohqsg
I don’t risk offending Uob or citi.The 2 most rewarding banks for credit card rewards now.And I won’t risk offending Uob or HSBC for banking accounts too.,btohqsg

Got... Uob nation of plunging chicken 🙊 promo if you are eligible... Then if you don't mind taking a bit of risk  moomoo 6.8%... These are higher than hsbc that I know of and don't need much conditions.,btohqsg
I thought the main factor is your refusal to show your proof/source of income (cos you don't have 1 and is not willing to be upfront about it)? With the recent AML case  banks are getting more uptight. When faced by customers with unknown or questionable funds  they rather earn less rather than to be implicated. I could have remembered wrongly tho...,btohqsg
Actually UOB one account no need to play musical chairs. The 4% on 150k is good enough.,btohqsg

For growing small amount of cash  I leaning towards GXS as they also have debit card. Maribank doesn’t have. I used to have Trust account but their 5 x $30 requirement makes it difficult to meet the requirements,btohqsg
I cannot meet the salary deposit unfortunately:(,btohqsg
why not maribank tho? its licensed and insured too 2.7% no frills at all,btohqsg
I am trying see if there is anything better than Maribank 2.7%. Trying the squeeze more from the buck I have lol,btohqsg
But cimb 3.5% is a promotion until end Sep. Not sure if they will extend. Also do they have debit card to use together?,btohqsg
The best you can get to almost no-frills is hopping between SCB eSaver and CIMB,btohqsg
"Hi gurus. I have a use case. For ocbc 360  an new account was opened with 100k deposited.On 30june  $3.84 interest was credited but was transferred out on the same day before 9pm.On 1jul  $500 was deposited for july Save bonus.But as shown in the money insights  total bal is 150k but the change in balance is not 500$ but 400$+.Does it mean the int credit should not be xferred out? Or is there like a different ""cutoff"" timing to xfer funds out?",btohqsg
ah so they dont count the interest that they deposit until 1 july  interesting to seenever noticed this before cos i usually dont transfer out the interest  yes 1 july is monday so the problem isnt the 500 deposite,btohqsg
Sorry confused. 30june is sunday  1july is monday.,btohqsg
If you see their guide  it is usually better to check the MAB on the website,btohqsg
Eh sorry. 30 Jun withdrawal is Sunday  so only withdrawn on 1 Jul.,btohqsg
OH YA shucks i forgot abt the website one. Ok let me ask my friend to check ltr!!,btohqsg
Ohhh becus of working day. Got it. Thanks. Didnt knw..,btohqsg
I usually put in a bit more than 500 just in case of all these MAB calc hiccups.,btohqsg
Ya I personally kena for this mth for my own acct. Put in zhunzhun but still miscalculated somewhere.,btohqsg
Never zhun zhun... I rather lose 4+% interest on $100 than 1.5% on $100k. Lol,btohqsg
Isn’t scb esaver also no frills and a much safer bank?,btohqsg
Scb also an alternative.  All banks are the same,btohqsg
The second part is definitely not true,btohqsg
MAS has good control over the banks operating in Singapore. I will trust the ones with stronger Singapore ties.SCB latest promo jun - Jul is 3.55%.,btohqsg
Haha. Yeah that’s why banks have credit ratings.,btohqsg
It gets fuzzier now with the digital banks.Are they equal  safer  or more dangerous compared to bricks and mortar banks?,btohqsg
he cannot hit the credit card spend so i didnt include the cc spend bonus itnerestand also its 4.65% only if u have 100k  ir increases from 3.85% to 4.65% as ur balance increases from 75k to 100k  only after hitting 100k do we actually get 4.65%,btohqsg
Digital banking is a new animal to me.Probably ask those who knows more.,btohqsg
How to link the second yuu card to yuu app?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  can I kindly ask for your consult? If I pay my periodic payments on atome  does my credit card recognise Atome’s MCC or the underlying merchant’s MCC? Context  I’m trying to use the correct card for my atome credit card payment. Thanks!!,btohqsg
For digital bank  my view I look who is the backer. That why I started with Trust as it is from SC and FairPrice. But now they have made it difficult to fulfill the requirements.,btohqsg
Contact yuu CSO to remove the currently linked card first  then link the second card to the app.,btohqsg
