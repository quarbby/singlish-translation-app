amaze+crmc gets 4mpd assuming mcc not excluded,btohqsg

There is new entrant Chocolate for 2mpd with 'no fx fees'... $1k cap per month... see how long that lasts!,btohqsg
The current HSBC EGA bonus interest is 2.85% and base interest is 0.05%. if I transfer in $1000 every month to maintain the incremental  does it mean only the latest $1000 will earn the bonus interest and all the past saving will only earn 0.05%? Thank you.,btohqsg
Ain't a visa card I thought only Mastercard work with amaze,btohqsg
she meant using choco card directly to pay for hospital expenses,btohqsg
or the overseas expense at 'no fx fees',btohqsg
No! The additional 1k will only be entitled to the 1%,btohqsg
ok there is YES and NO discrepancy because HSBC EGA has many components of bonus interest.For OP question.. let's say he started with $50k and every month add $1kThe original $50k will not earn the bonus 2.x% interest beyond the first 2 months.The incremental $1k will earn the incremental bonus 1% interestThe big bonus 2.x% interest will cease once you are out of the Signup period and you are unlikely to earn any big bonus 2.x% interest unless you had emptied the account.,btohqsg
(actually i think HSBC EGA intentionally makes their account TNC very hard to explain in words  so it cannot be easily taught LOL).btw  note the latest HSBC EGA big bonus DOES NOT APPLY to accounts opened in 2025... ridiculous.,btohqsg
Hi All investment gurus  i notice endowus us charging quite jigh for portfolio mgmt fee,btohqsg
many investment managers charge significantly for managed portfolios.hence most would recommend doing DCA by yourself where you only need to pay trading commissions.No free lunch... managed portfolios or funds ALWAYS have a fee  just how they present it only.Heck  even if you DCA into ETFs  the ETF also charges a fee!,btohqsg
Is there a better alternative (like using other platform) or solution to avoid the fee by directly investing the underlying funds.,btohqsg
Someone needs to pay their salary mah ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚If not from customer then who.,btohqsg
the moment FUNDS is mentioned  there is always a fee  whether by the Fund Manager or the platform provider  or BOTH,btohqsg
But is there any alternative to get a lower portfolio  platform fees,btohqsg
it depends on your relationship with the FI honestly..if mass market you are price taker  so you have to shop around to see which are the mass market platforms that can offer cheaply..if you do with banks  you can negotiate little to no platform fee for holding Funds. But their sales commission may be highyou want to be cheapo.. buy outside then transfer in.. but watch for transfer fees,btohqsg
