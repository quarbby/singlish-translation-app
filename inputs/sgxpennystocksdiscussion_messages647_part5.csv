Malaysia bank raise interest rate to 4 to 5 percent from next week start . Jialet Liao .. home loan payer .Good luck,btohqsg
Malaysia interest always higher than Sing. But currency always trending lower,btohqsg

This has been a given I cautioned my friends n colleagues since 2 years ago. Property easy to buy but when need to difficult to sell bcos big ticket item,btohqsg
My friend still take full loan to buy house in Malaysia . Good luck to him,btohqsg
As for the basket.. It's never really disclosed.. But you can guess,btohqsg
Heng I no money buy property at all,btohqsg
Sorry to say but Malaysian property not so good to buy for investment unless ownself living. Rental returns is so bad worse if capital depreciation. They hv so much more land compared to Singapore so cannot compare prices Lah,btohqsg
Yes . They buy for own stay,btohqsg
Aiya Sam don’t like that leh. You are doing fine 👌,btohqsg
Actually if can wait I think can buy cheaper when current owners cannot afford to pay installments forced sell. I’m Singapore too but now global so uncertain if can delay better delay I think,btohqsg
Own stay also die .. every month their salary is fix,btohqsg
Wait. These hot cycle one. Meanwhile save your money first ☺️,btohqsg
Wait for those ppty kena auction .. can slowly pick .. no hurry .. i bot my ppty in auction loh ..,btohqsg
Exactly. I so old hv seen at least 2-3 such cycles. Japan bubble burst property prices dropped by 60-70% from peak till recently not recovered yet,btohqsg
Ya. Bcos too much cheap money from including China pushed up bubbles every where,btohqsg
Yea .. all the easy money come,btohqsg
I am not surprised. Enjoyed good life where want to go back to suffer like old days,btohqsg

Buy buy and buy .. faster buy,btohqsg
The worst is yet to come. See maybe up to 6 to 7%,btohqsg
Ya read somewhere too like old days,btohqsg
Yes true ... This confirm will come,btohqsg
Anyone here seen sg home loan interest rate at 5 to 6 percent before?,btohqsg
The highest i kena was 4.5 %,btohqsg
I had seen it when I was in secondary days . My parents almost bankruptcy I witnessed that moment,btohqsg
This generation only seen Low interest rate which has been abnormal for so long including negative interest 😩😂😂😂,btohqsg
Yes ..  but I can tell this likely will come back soon . Maybe another 3 to 4 year time,btohqsg
Cham cant remember think was in 2009 ..,btohqsg
I think so too bcos too many bubbles  too much leverage n global economic growth no good. Hardly any more Low level growth engines now,btohqsg
Those keep buying and buying property without a stand by cash . Good luck,btohqsg
Even if hv standby cash if crash how much can you tahan 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Alot people take leverage .. take almost 70 to 80 percent loan  ..,btohqsg
Unless ur pocket is very very deep ...,btohqsg
At least have time to manage another way .,btohqsg
I sold my property 3rd qtr of last year bought during Asian financial crisis,btohqsg
Yea.. usually pocket deep is pay at least 50 to 60 down payments ..,btohqsg
Wait slowly for next chance ☺️ but I think must wait long long bcos this time global bubble too big take very long time to recover I think,btohqsg
Then where you park your money now ? 🤔,btohqsg
Some physical precious metals n cash slowly buy when price down. I think gold silver can preserve value n easily sold. Actually I made money liow. I bought when usd weak against s$ and metal prices Low.,btohqsg
