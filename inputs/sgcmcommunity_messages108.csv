when cat A and B 5k diff,btohqsg
I’d never drive one  let alone buy.,btohqsg
but if i gna get c200.. i might as well get a 2 series,btohqsg
If I’m getting a Benz  it’s either a 45/63 C/E or it’ll be anything S and above.No point getting a base model luxury car with the luxury taken out hahaha,btohqsg
Like buying a Rolls Royce but only getting the umbrella handle.,btohqsg
You don’t have to agree  just my $0.45 worth,btohqsg
i wud get the C class cus its just the nice size  with the comfort,btohqsg
He down tune and went inspection to change Cat,btohqsg
My dream is to own car can alr  copen reminds me of my rickshaw,btohqsg
nope BHP is > 130  places it in cat B,btohqsg
Exactly. Hence  why the country is filled with a lot of base model cars.Go overseas and you’ll see the 300s and high spec cars.,btohqsg
Here are C300 on the road I get excited,btohqsg
I’m happy with a base lancer or impreza here,btohqsg

I like the look of a wrx but too expensive,btohqsg

Speaking of  don’t know how Audi managed to convince someone in the factory to release a FWD  150HP A4,btohqsg
But wrx is drive to workshop,btohqsg

A FWD Audi is wild enough,btohqsg
the new 116 and 216 only 107 BHP holy mama,btohqsg
must tune to tune it back up,btohqsg
and PERFORMANCE motors not bringing in the X8 series alr.. for some reason,btohqsg
I meant 118 218 etc not X8 HAHA,btohqsg
Why the front steal from kia one,btohqsg
Ask them to sell you an a250,btohqsg
Dealers all bring in the base inventory for Singapore,btohqsg
honestly  if i were to choose between a a200 and a hyundai avante.. i rather take the avante..,btohqsg
Very hard to indent and get better spec also,btohqsg
must pass NEA emissions standards leh,btohqsg
The sales will be adamant to get you into what they have in stock,btohqsg
Oh it will take 8 months,btohqsg
Unpopular Opinion: Never trust the salesman. Most of the time they have no clue as to what they are selling. Do your own homework,btohqsg
Cause for them clearing inventory more important,btohqsg
That's why in the middle a lot of glb35s,btohqsg
yeah later inventory become obsolence then got writing off to do in the company books.,btohqsg
The sales team got targets to meet one,btohqsg
Only in c&c Merc  pa Audi and pml bmw,btohqsg
And what I've heard when speaking to friends,btohqsg

Cam car tries to cut into a McLaren Convoy but gets denied access by a McLaren 720sCam-car's 🚙 attempt to filter behind the McLaren Convoy was disrupted ❌ by a McLaren 720S that sped ⚡ past to prevent overtaking ❗.Just like how a Tilapia 🐟 does not swim 🏊‍♂ with whales 🐳  the cam car 🚘 should leave the McLaren convoy alone 💨- M 😰🫠🥵⬇ Read the full article here ⬇http://bit.ly/3imLuVd,btohqsg

Don’t remind me sir. My brother@arnavgulianiand I Sadded still coz we jio and someone didn’t show,btohqsg
Honestly.. i dont get the tyre shine🧐 aft they shine for me a few days ltr not shiny alr,btohqsg
Kinda defeats the whole purpose.. just looks good for photo taking,btohqsg
After that dirty  can go wash again,btohqsg
Or just wash your wheels and put on tyre shine if the body is still clean,btohqsg
Yes don’t drive then can keep shiny. Anyway I personally find too glossy very tacky but that’s me ah. Don’t flame me pls 🔥 🔥 🔥@SGCM_Admin///M Performance,btohqsg
Im happy with just keeping the body clean,btohqsg
But i realised as per article.. with a hatchback the rear is damn dirty,btohqsg

MG Singapore teases launch of MG4 alongside another new EV 😍A series of posts on the firm's Instagram page has teased the arrival of a duo of new EVs  with the latest one all but confirming that the MG4 is on its way.👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you can't wait to know what MG Singapore has in store for us!➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
but mg4 looks small in terms of space,btohqsg
In this present age of mindless anti China  sentiment  MG is British heritage  China built. So pro West propagandists should not buy. Hee hee,btohqsg
Aiya china or not china  a car most impt attributes : price  suits your needs  worryless  easy to drive easy to use. And most importantly  fuel consumption light,btohqsg
Good to be in America to buy EV. America Government literally subsidised folks buying EVs made in USA.,btohqsg
I mean SG the pathway is such that only the rich and upper middle income can buy car for now,btohqsg
Tbh if everyone got car sg sure jam like mad,btohqsg
Every one has 1 car still ok. 🫢,btohqsg
If 1 has many cars  he/she is using quota meant for other ppl. So 2nd car onwards  is same person  COE must be x% higher. Haha,btohqsg
Many Governments envy Singapore Government able to push through this COE ideal. They do not dare to push it in their parliamentary legislative process as there might be repercussions of been voted out of office. Hee hee. If you’ve been to Bangkok and Manila or Jakarta  their peak hour traffic is horrific and exhausting!,btohqsg
I mean in the states 100k can get u a conti alr😂,btohqsg
In states 100k can buy supercar,btohqsg
COE is LTA golden boy. Will never be scrap by Government. However  there is a need to tweak the current system as it favours the rich and wealthy at the expense of people who need vehicles to work or run businesses!,btohqsg
I cannot imagine Singapore with no COE,btohqsg
Then I will sell my car and buy copen liao,btohqsg
Some don't want the last 2,btohqsg
But you cannot avail subsidies on the more popular EVs anymore,btohqsg
As they have crossed the number of EV cars produced to still avail subsidies for those brands,btohqsg
Porsche also getting close to nit having subsidy,btohqsg
Not exactly  if as an individual you have 3 cars,btohqsg
You're not always using those 3 are you,btohqsg
Singapore small and since the start build on same base of policies and infrastructure map,btohqsg
Other countries bigger in size as well and the policies pushed by different governments were different,btohqsg
Need a backbone of infrastructure on the public transport side to be able to push such a system that makes people consider alternatives to car or bike ownership,btohqsg
This model cannot work everywhere purely due to geographical reasons and costs involved in setting up this infrastructure as well,btohqsg
But the other 2 COE quota u can let others have it if they wana buy..,btohqsg
As u said  can only drive 1 car at a time 🫢,btohqsg
But one wants to own multiple,btohqsg
And is capable of doing so,btohqsg
Pay more COE after first car.,btohqsg
We live in a capitalist world not a socialist one,btohqsg
Bro  i have to say this logic is flawed because other countries dont limit car population. We do  so even if u got 3 cars and ur driving one  ur taking quota for the other 2.,btohqsg
Ur not wrong  but most societies arent fully capitalistic nowadays. There is a mixed of both capitalism and socialism eitherways,btohqsg
They will probably be able to do that as well  very few will be deterred from buying a second car based on a marginal increase in COE if they can already afford a car,btohqsg
Even communist china has both. Communist govt with a capitalistic market,btohqsg
Its like HDB u can only buy 1. But if u can afford and u wan buy more properties  u can buy privates but that wont be the same price as HDBs 🤔,btohqsg
Because number of COEs out there still limited,btohqsg
And the socialism aspect comes in for necessities in most places,btohqsg
Which is true with Singapore as well,btohqsg
Explain to me how a car is a necessity in a country that's smaller than many cities in the world,btohqsg
And has one of the best public transport networks around the world,btohqsg
I think someone put up this argument before. This poor guy got 6 meetings in one day,btohqsg
He has to then consider if he is working under a company  he can probably get a transport allowance of he cannot buy a car himself,btohqsg
If it's his own business that's just starting,btohqsg
But can schedule his calendar in a way that he is able to make them using public transport,btohqsg
But cannot go blame the top man for everything,btohqsg
Read the argument you were referring to starting from here,btohqsg
I read it before~ just see how our policies gna balance it out. Just that someone will win and someone will lose at the end of the day. Not everyone can be satisfied. 🧐,btohqsg
I should get a 1.6 impreza,btohqsg
U KEEP MENTIONING IMPREZA IMPREZA impreza,btohqsg
I keep seeing alot impreza now,btohqsg
Coe needs - socialist vs capitalist,btohqsg
But i feel subaru with a 2 litre engine will be nicer,btohqsg
Your standard of slow and my standard of slow is different,btohqsg
2.0 wrx quite fast enough for me,btohqsg
the new 2.0 imprezas are barely pushing 160hp,btohqsg
bro every car manufacturers are downtuning their cars,btohqsg
its up to you to uptune it TO MAXIMISE ITS POTENTIAL!!!,btohqsg
some cars are not meant to be modded,btohqsg
i see some fella on tiktok flexing his 120hp,btohqsg
THIS. CURSED CAR. SHUD HAVE NVR BEEN MANUFACTURED. THEY TOOK OUT MY LANCER!!!,btohqsg
I saw an itb setup in a vios before,btohqsg
Time to sell if this policy kicks in.,btohqsg
they shud just come up w a scheme lo  like those car collectors  they pay for the COE(without affecting quota) then limit X number of cars can be driven at 1 go lo,btohqsg
Suppose to be a very very budget car.In Thailand selling Ard SGD$18 000,btohqsg
In Indo these things sell for around SGD12 000,btohqsg
During sale can be sub 80k,btohqsg
Oh damn. She did not work today! - J,btohqsg
Got a nice civic in the market rn,btohqsg

Been looking for a civic lately,btohqsg
I am bored if the usual white  black  yellow and red civics now,btohqsg
So I've been looking into blue ones!,btohqsg
I cannot afford without full loan  I was planning to loan 110% of the car value,btohqsg
Gives me money for repairs also,btohqsg
A full loan by itself isn't legal per se,btohqsg
Dealer just has to declare higher car value,btohqsg
Yeah that's how full loan works,btohqsg
The dp amount essentially added to car price to make it look like you paid dp alr,btohqsg
My boss laughed at me today for paying more than double for a 6 year old mx5 than his brand new a35,btohqsg
Wow your boss very easy to please,btohqsg
Laughed on the same thing a few months ago,btohqsg
Ya lor haiya.. everything also up,btohqsg
Aiya this is Singapore. Thats why retire in another country better,btohqsg
Big house big car less stress,btohqsg

Ngl mechanics prey on ur ignorance  ur state of mind to earn money,btohqsg

next time ask the old timers here,btohqsg
the veterans will buy their own EO and go their regular ws to do,btohqsg

dunno is that a model number or not,btohqsg
I using the tsapa with 2 years warranty...,btohqsg
hi can i check  im buying a secondhand car and im applying for bank loan  my 1st yr insurance is it a MUST to get comprehensive?,btohqsg
I highly suggest you get comprehensive,btohqsg
so its not a must ah,btohqsg
i was told it is a must to get comprehensive as im applying bank loan  eg. if i full cash the car  i can ownself apply for 3rd party insurance,btohqsg
Comprehensive cover 3rd party damage  theft  fire... Why wouldn't you?,btohqsg
Wa bro can get comprehensive just get comprehensive,btohqsg
Ur car left how many years?,btohqsg
Third party for coe cars left 1 year then take,btohqsg
thanks for all ur suggestion but by law/by right  its not mandatory to get comprehensive for the 1st year of purchasing a car?,btohqsg
comprehensive is better ma  why won't u want to take it up?,btohqsg
if u think workshop is pulling a fast one on u  you can check w the bank directly.,btohqsg
by covenants i do mean terms and conditions before loan is issued.,btohqsg
oh okay so the T&C should specific comprehensive for 1st yr  subsequent is up to us?,btohqsg
depends. could be as long as loan not paid.,btohqsg
If I were the bank I would specify it,btohqsg
btw bro  the car is not urs until u finish the loan leh. so if u crash the car  but u urself unable to repay  the bank has no asset to seize back,btohqsg
Honestly comprehensive is for your own benefit too.,btohqsg
You will be sued for the difference as the bank will not be left high and dry one,btohqsg
Imagine all the people with savings in the bank 😉,btohqsg
Ohh okay thanks so much gurus 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Best to get comprehensive as the premium difference isn't too much and for the next year you can start using your NCD if you don't have any claims to offset the difference,btohqsg
Well how to sue someone who dont have money to repair his car bro😂😂 but prolly get u bankrupt,btohqsg
Can come after your assets then,btohqsg
And take away the car you have,btohqsg
my assumption is the car is alr banged up,btohqsg
not talking general ah bro haha hence the comprehensive insurance requirements,btohqsg

"Hi guys  need some advice. I drive a 2011 W204 (C180K). Low mileage (92K). Have been thinking of ""upgrading"" to a newer (2018 or 2019) Mazda 6. Should I go for a newer car or hold on to this one?",btohqsg
Do u need a bigger car for family purposes? I dun see the need to change😂,btohqsg
If u sell ur current car get back how much,btohqsg
Then the amt u get enuf to dp for mazda 6?,btohqsg
I've been offered more than what my car was worth when I got it in 2020. Need to check my outstanding loan amount.,btohqsg
No  but the car is 12 years old. I forsee quite abit of expenditure for wear and tear parts.,btohqsg
If the amt u get back aft deducting loan is enuf to DP why not,btohqsg
Then see the monthly instalment still same or increase,btohqsg
😂😂 just saying ur new mazda 6 u also dk how the prev owner maintain,btohqsg
Might also need change parts but THEN AGAIN,btohqsg
Parts r cheaper compared to mercs,btohqsg
Cus now ur loan Interest rate vs ur then loan interest rate shud be substantially different,btohqsg
Idh the numbers for u so u go excel it out😂😂,btohqsg
Does the newer mazda hav better fc?,btohqsg
Oh SHIT BRO JUST CHANGE CAR ALR,btohqsg
You're gonna sell high and buy high,btohqsg
As interest rates have increased significantly,btohqsg
Also look into what unit you get,btohqsg
Better find a well maintained one,btohqsg
this is just a joke btw,btohqsg
Albeit Mazda 6s don't have too many known issues yet,btohqsg
but honestly finances the most important. I feel given the current market  the cars are way way way way way overpriced. let it cool first. maintenance wise for every car is required anyways. but since its hitting 100k  u do need to do abit of change of parts.. e.g fan belts  maybe walnut blast the engine. check suspension  brakepads  brake fluids and stuff,btohqsg
If maintained properly throughout it's life,btohqsg
It's a cost benefit analysis that needs to be done,btohqsg
Changing car will bring in a fair few costs again,btohqsg
And you don't know if the wear and tear has been done up or not,btohqsg
Yah AND DONT BUY THE RUBBISH THAT CAR WELL MAINTAINED by FEMALE OWNER,btohqsg
Cus FEMALE OWNERS DRIVE MORE RABAK😂😂😂,btohqsg
I see more men screwing up these days,btohqsg
Most listings whack only female owner  shelter parked etc.,btohqsg
Then again.. sometimes it ish female owner. But not she drive :o,btohqsg
Look at the car as a machine and judge condition,btohqsg
u saying auntie like me will thrash car ah?,btohqsg
My prev statement stands: dc guy or girl. Is see how owner maintains,btohqsg
So all these statements shud not be like published on the page,btohqsg
i think they might reveal tmrw in sg akso,btohqsg
