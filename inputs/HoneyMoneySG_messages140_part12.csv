Beside warranty  HK set is mostly compatible with sg network. Samsung pay may have issue but you have google pay as backup. HK set doesn't have esim so if it's not a concern.For me  esim is a must so I opted not to get hk version for my phone.,btohqsg
The eSIM issue can be mitigated easily by 5ber  9eSIM  and other similar solutions.,btohqsg
If the price gap is wide enough  adding in these solutions still saves you money  plus you’ve the flexibility to “export” the eSIM profile to other devices without asking for new QR code  since it’s the pSIM that’s tied to the eSIM profile  not your handset.,btohqsg
I wanted the esim too  apparently after I mentioned about it. Seller said the phone can support esim and samsung pay. Maybe the global one is not from HK anymore? I don't know... seem weird to me...,btohqsg
Just curious is HK set cheaper than the prices here,btohqsg
Currently using 5ber. It just works like a normal physical sim lo. Just that it can be changed in the app to select the eSIM profile you want to use.,btohqsg
This is whymobile website. A hp shop in far east,btohqsg
Actually the export and local set price on the website shown only 50$ difference. Not sure if saving $50 is worth (honestly havent used an export set before),btohqsg
Can I ask if the hsbc revolution card still earns 4mpd for purchases on shoppee/ lazada? Thanks,btohqsg
$50then not worth. Unless u mean buy from taobao or what.Price is about 20 to 25% cheaper for the flagship. [if compared to last year model locally] Bought a phone from taobao recently for my family members.,btohqsg
The one u got from taobao is what model?,btohqsg
You should look for the price in shoppee with that of the local set from whymobile.,btohqsg
My dp so far had been coded MCC 5311 if shopped online and pay through ShopBack link. Shopped at Gain City and Xandro online store.However if pay using ShopBack QR in store  usually follow the merchant MCC but MCC might change  e.g. I paid for my aircon at Gain City using ShopBack QR  codes as 5814.,btohqsg
Anyone using eight sim card? Do you experience lost signals? My phone often gets no signal then connects back.,btohqsg
Eight works well for me. It’s StarHub rented network.,btohqsg
My one offen lost signals  1-2 times per day.,btohqsg
Your frequently visited areas may have issues with StarHub...,btohqsg
Sometimes the signal fall to 4g only  the speed is super slow,btohqsg
This is interesting. Too bad it doesnt support iphone else id have given it a try.,btohqsg
iOS restriction... But technically you can always write/swap eSIM profile on Android (5ber/9eSIM/eSIM.me/others) or Windows (for 9eSIM only with dongle) and insert the SIM into iPhone.,btohqsg

Hi expertsWill there be any FX fees if I buy air ticket online (Skyscanner Expedia ect.) while I'm at another country?,btohqsg
Fx fee mean charge in foreign currency different from your card. Dcc mean the payment is process in country different from your issue card,btohqsg
I see  as long as I select SG currency there won't be any DCC charges?,btohqsg
U selected sg mean no fcy charge  dcc depend where they process the payment. Website have different payment gateway for different card issue  can be local or oversea. U can google to know more in detail. But nobody can tell u for sure,btohqsg
Hello guys  paid this with uob one credit card. The transection said net*. Would wonder  if this counts towards min spending? (TNC said exclude netflashpay),btohqsg
This is not a NETS transaction.,btohqsg
Hey Melvyn what this means please.,btohqsg
Would like to ask those who booked hotel from Expedia before... Any option to choose upfront payment in foreign currency? I did 2 bookings recently  both were charged in SGD and I only realised it until amaze charges me domestic spend surcharge. 😅,btohqsg
Anyone knows if using grab express to send parcels is wat mcc code or if it counts towards transport category for uob lady card?,btohqsg
I guess it's my fault for not realising amaze was being charged SGD instead of foreign currency... But I have previous bad experience with RCI Cruise  where I booked from their sg website and I paid in SGD... but as the payment gateway was based overseas  I was charged DCC (or something else)... So not sure how can we be sure to avoid payment fees?,btohqsg
Anyone knows what could have triggered this? All I did was update email address with UOB. My residential address and tax status had always been Singapore.,btohqsg
Looks like generic telling u. Info changed. No cause for alarm,btohqsg
There is no change required at ur end  unless there is a change with ur residency  citizenship. Any change in circumstances or new account opening with FI will require this to be reported for regulatory purposes.,btohqsg
What card are using with amaze on Expedia?Payment gateway for Expedia is in Singapore so no need to worry about DCC.,btohqsg
Hmm  I see. Very odd  since I didn’t open anything new 😅 Nothing changed for me  guess I’ll just ignore it,btohqsg
Are you sure no one is updating ur personal details? The mail seems to say email address was updated.,btohqsg
Is a system triggered process I believe. Where there is a change in ur pdpa  there is a potential change in ur residency.,btohqsg
Better check in your uob account what is the email lol,btohqsg
Why y'all so kanchiong for him? The letter literally just say email changed  and he said he did email change.,btohqsg
hi.. using healthhub app to pay polyclinic bill  need to use with Amaze+citi rewards? or i can just use citi rewards directly? Thanks,btohqsg
If selling in HK  there is no GST/VAT there vs 9% here. Should compare with pre-GST SG price.,btohqsg
I used Citi rewards directly without issues,btohqsg
Thks... Wasn't trying to turn it into online spending  just thought payment would be in FCY or based overseas thus have used amaze.,btohqsg
Expedia is always online 😀. And what card needs online for expedia? I hope you are not using citi rewards.,btohqsg
I'm not a miles guy  using ocbc infinity. Lol.,btohqsg
Yup  I changed email  but didn’t open anything new with UOB 😊,btohqsg
Ah it's normal. Like ad Melvyn said  bank sent mail update for this too. I got one for updating my address. 😁,btohqsg
Hmm  I see. First time received. I didn’t receive this when I changed residential address 😅 but receive for change of email.,btohqsg
Strange thing is I didn’t receive when I update address 2yrs ago. Maybe this is new sop,btohqsg
