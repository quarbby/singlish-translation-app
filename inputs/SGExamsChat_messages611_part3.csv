Tbh Idm ah   as long as got reply can alr  I'm taking GP with my H2s in y3 anw,btohqsg
This year is H1 and MT,btohqsg
ChatGPT specialises in presenting information (Similar as to what the purpose of the media is)Your GP essay is more akin to an opinion article. It needs to come with a strong sense of personal voice which already  chatGPT cannot achieve. Let alone other things like argumentative skills.,btohqsg
Which is why I would say you CAN use chatgpt to gather information for GP. But you shouldnt ask ChatGPT to write your whole essay,btohqsg
