I mean at the end of the day a job is to give you pay and give your marni,btohqsg
better to suffer in agony or get permanent head damage,btohqsg
Why Si Yan did u choose permanent head damage,btohqsg
Actually he chose private hire driver,btohqsg
He can measure the thermodynamics of the tire for maximum efficiency in fuel consumption,btohqsg
the only thing I can think of is not just about career  but career longevity,btohqsg
What's the career lifespan of air stewardess?,btohqsg
But these days with the popularity of job hopping imo it's mitigated and an ancient theory liao,btohqsg
I keep seeing girls clip their wings 5-8 yrs or so into their careers,btohqsg
Air stewardess was once my dream job but i dun qualify lmao,btohqsg
no not related to job hopping,btohqsg
I mean SIAâ€™s ground staff jobs,btohqsg
Start at 20 end at 27 seem like the pivotal period of time for air stewardesses,btohqsg
Some go into their 30s but those are exceptions  the culture for flying is too toxic alr I've been hearing,btohqsg
no idea on thatif it pays well why not,btohqsg
Oh u mean the cyclical market or like the gig work itself?,btohqsg
I hv actually seen 30-40y/o stewardess on the flight before,btohqsg

True. U gotta plan for the long term indeed but I think Musician got trouble in the first stage. She cannot even sell herself as an attractive asset for now,btohqsg
Huh  no but aren't there other airlines as competitors to sia,btohqsg
Yea but it is still one of the top airlines in the world,btohqsg
hmm didn't get earlier part of story,btohqsg
Basically i somehow grew interest in the aviation industry after flying post-covid lol,btohqsg
Their air tixs are expensive because they have demand justifying the high prices,btohqsg

The sky is the limit (literally),btohqsg
