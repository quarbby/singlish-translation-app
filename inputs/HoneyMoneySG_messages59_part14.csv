Recently spoken to one of RM  he told me floating rate is cheaper in the long run‚Ä¶,btohqsg
The short answer is: if you think rates will likely go down during your loan period  then floating. If u think rates will go up during your loan tenure   then go for fixed. If you don‚Äôt know whether rates will go up or down  then it doesn‚Äôt matter in the grand scheme of things ü§£,btohqsg

What is the strategy to get most out of this card? Spend exactly 1k every month?,btohqsg
yes. If u have spending that will not earn more rebate/points using other cards.,btohqsg
does the 3.3% stack with the quarterly bonus? Or the 3.33% is the quarterly bonus?,btohqsg
quarterly rebate is $30/$100 = max 3.33%,btohqsg
Is this better than the Uob One that I signed up this month. It says 3.3% for all spends. Does it mean that I should spend only max $2000 per month üòÖif I could üòÑto maximise the rebates. Any amount above this I should use another card,btohqsg
unless it's special categories like Shopee  then you can exceed 2000k,btohqsg
Oh I c. So there are categories that is exempted from this $2000 cap. I‚Äôll go and find out more. Very confusing,btohqsg

Thanks for sharingWtf  why they reduce for fast food pui‚Ä¶ some more advertise Gao Gao on all the macdonalds credit card scanners that they got 6% cashback (I know it‚Äôs 5% now). Good load of bullshitEven no min spend and no frills card like SC smart can beat them for fast food.OCBC rly damn cb,btohqsg

Has anyone ever tfd usd cash from syfe to moomoo?,btohqsg
Not only that. I think the minimum card spent is 800 now  instead of 500 to get the cash rebate for each category. Anything below 800  it's 0.3%.,btohqsg
Oh haha  it‚Äôs always 800 for min spend leh for credit card cashback. 500 is for OCBC 360 account bonus interestOnly the cashback for categories nerf and nerf since the start of the year. My personal favourite is how they masked the last dining and travel nerf as a ‚Äúboost‚Äù by introducing categories that not many ppl will spend much $ on. OCBC marketing tok kong,btohqsg
