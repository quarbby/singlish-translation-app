Authentic halal rice dumplings started by man from China & Malay wife a hit with S‚ÄôporeansIn the lead-up to the Dragon Boat Festival  they rushed out about 300 dumplings a day to meet the high demand.üëâhttps://tsl.to/halaldumplings@mustsharenews,btohqsg
Singapore is a mix of cultures,btohqsg
Dumplings without pork lacks of the omph/yums and tradition...,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like Deng DengNever can be the same as Bak Kwa,btohqsg
For us that can eat the original  we will think of that. But for those that has dietary limitations  it's a welcome.,btohqsg
I only eat kee zhang or vegetarian deüòÅ,btohqsg
Personally  I'm kinda tired of major food chains going 'halal'.. I love actual bacon in my burgers and sandwiches.. turkey bacon and chicken bacon.. both fairly dry however you do it.,btohqsg
Yups both of U are not wrong,btohqsg
"For us that are not limited  most of the time we prefer the ""original"" but for others that had limitations  such adjustments would be fresh for them and at the same time to appreciate the other flavours  texture and of course  culture.",btohqsg
Culture usually does not disappear just becos of a specific food ingredients (they do  but that story can be explained for appreciation. U may not need to eat it),btohqsg
Just like xiao long bao.. still taste better with pork üòÅWith chicken  I tried b4.. the taste is somewhat differentBut my Muslim col like the chicken zhup in it  cos she never try xiao long bao b4 in her life.After eat the halal ding tai feng.. she love it,btohqsg
a hit with Muslim Singaporeans perhaps..?,btohqsg
I wonder if there are similar stuff in Xinjiang region,btohqsg
Yeah so I think for usWho tasted the pork versionWill never find the non pork version betterBut for those who don‚Äôt eat pork It‚Äôs a chance to try a cuisine they never had access to,btohqsg
anyways please remember those dumplings are made with glutinous riceÔºå so eat them in moderation,btohqsg
glutinous rice is actually oily even if you cook it plainly like normal white rice,btohqsg
imo  Glutinous rice with peanuts n fried shallots.. those old sch type taste better than dumpling,btohqsg
I like my bak zhang with all the liao in the world!With bak and mushroom and chestnut and beans and salted egg,btohqsg
Put as many as u like,btohqsg
I think my future husband ahAll his money spend on my food nia,btohqsg
