I was not sure how the ncd protector works. I check with direct Asia   they say if u have a claim   the ncd will be different,btohqsg
If you have 50% it’ll only drop to 20%,btohqsg
Some might take ur full protected ncd. But charge u higher premium,btohqsg
Its w insurer A. Insurer B might not honor,btohqsg
Thts if u renew w your original insurer. Then ur 50% is protected,btohqsg
If I change insurance company  means the ncd will drop,btohqsg
If u renew with them  u check how much is ur prem vs taking a new one,btohqsg
All higher than current one. Cos of the ncd not 50%,btohqsg
Cfm change of insurer will be 20% ncd,btohqsg

Is it that old car better to join AA? As well as if got drive to msia,btohqsg
