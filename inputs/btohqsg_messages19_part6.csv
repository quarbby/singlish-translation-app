always wondered the difference between this 2  I think possesion date is not the key collection one,btohqsg
Haha yeh I think based on this source  it appears that there will be (1) completion date conveyed during launch  (2) completion date conveyed nearing launch  (3) then delivery possession date,btohqsg
As an aside  it appears that they lumped the stats for all the Kallang Whampoa tgt for this launch‚Ä¶  not very reflective of actual stats,btohqsg
Yes thats something what they like to do in stats reporting generally ‚Ä¶ if they were to separate all projects   the results will be quite different‚Ä¶,btohqsg
This is a standard practice all this while. Has been like that for years le.,btohqsg
i had applied for this round and actually they lumped all 3 projects into a single application too..,btohqsg
Then what‚Äôs the point of them saying the bto rail green I cck Oct 23 takes only 39 months to complete? Regardless ppl still have to wait 5 years plus to collect keys right?,btohqsg
sorry my point was that it‚Äôs not just the stats but in terms of application  they lumped all 3 projects in kallang into 1 under ‚Äúkallang/Whampoa‚Äù. So if i am eyeing say Kallang  while I may get a queue number  I may not get to choose the kallang one and have to choose tenteram which is my last choice for example.are you asking about the delivery possession date (dpd)? yeah it‚Äôs another period of waiting it seems,btohqsg
At least can see the flat lol,btohqsg
for the rail green I CCK BTO Oct 23 - Estimated waiting time : 39 months- Estimated completion date: 4Q 2027- Delivery possession date: 30 June 2029.Was wondering how early would it be if no pandemic  issues  etc everything go smoothly?,btohqsg
I think it might be 30 June 2029 (delivery possession date) :(,btohqsg
yeah  its the date  whereby HDB have to die die give us the flat  if not must compensate if its delay after. like the recent cases with the flats getting delayed after their DPD by the pandemic.,btohqsg
I think keys are usually delivered before DPD - HDB are legally obligated to,btohqsg
"there are two clauses in the contract  namely  delivery possession date (""DPD"") and estimated completion date (""ECD"")",btohqsg
in general  hdb provides a 'later' completion date so they would not have to bear liquidated damages in the event that it's not completed by the ECD.,btohqsg
but it is also likely that the DPD might come after the completion date,btohqsg
Hi  anyone can share the hfe which we applied for when it get approved  does the letter shows the loan for both NEW or RESALE? Thanks,btohqsg
Based on the HDB press release for Oct 2023 BTO  seems to be:1.) If we get a bad queue number but still within the flat supply (number of units within the project)  we cannot apply for Dec 2023 BTO.2.) If we get a queue number out of the flat supply  we can apply for Dec 2023 BTO. However  if got enough people drop out of the selection and we end up getting a chance to select for Oct 2023. But if we dont select because only left bad units to choose from then hdb will auto cancel the Dec 2023 BTO queue number even if its super good.,btohqsg
Point one is inferred from Para 9a  and Point 2 is inferred from Para 9b.,btohqsg
If the end of the day the same number it reflect the true demand.,btohqsg
2 property agents have been fined for marketing empty BTO flats that did not fulfill their 5-year minimum occupation period.https://str.sg/ip4U,btohqsg
Hi for those sc/spr applicants  the 10k additional premium need to pay during lease signing agreement or during key collection? Thanks,btohqsg
It'll be added onto the unit price. So you count your downpayment accordingly,btohqsg
sorry whats the premium for again?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like an additional cost to buy a house with SPR.,btohqsg
SC and Singapore PR applying for a flat have to pay an extra 10k which is added onto the unit price.10k will be returned if:1) PR becomes citizen2) SG baby born,btohqsg
Good morning  yesterday informed by HDB there a bal 2rm flat in fernvale vines  I have check out the flat  all seem good but the down side is it is on #4 and facing LRT.During 2019 launch the pricing start is between 102k to 151k  I wonder how much will HDB sell me,btohqsg
For 3rm does this mean that everyone that applied will get a queue number  or will some of the 2nd timer families will not get a queue number as only 15% of flat supply is set aside for 2nd timer families?,btohqsg
Some of the second timer wouldn‚Äôt get a queue number,btohqsg
but isnt it weird not to give the remaining Q to the rest of 2nd timers? the total applicants are lower than total units available  so everyone should be able to get a Q?,btohqsg
Yeah it would be weird if those flats goes into sbf supply when the bto applicants was lesser than the flat supply.,btohqsg
For first timers  64.5 individuals applied for 129 houses. That‚Äôs why the ratio is 0.5For second timers  83.6 individuals applied for 22 houses. That‚Äôs why the ratio is 3.8,btohqsg
So all first timers will definitely get a queue number  whereas only 1 in 3 second timers will get a house.,btohqsg
Q number is given to x1 of flat supply?,btohqsg
But realistically there are only 22 houses for the 83.6 second timers,btohqsg
Receiving a queue number might not necessarily equate to getting a house as well.,btohqsg
Formula cross referenced against the one provided by the HDB website.,btohqsg
what happens to the rest of the flats allotted to first timers?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a good question. Likely goes towards the second timers given that there‚Äôs an excess,btohqsg
And/or to those with priority schemes,btohqsg
I believe they will give all first timers the queue first. Then if still got remaining will go to second timers. Best to check with Hdb,btohqsg
Also it bears mention that the final ratio will only be consolidated by 2pm later today :-),btohqsg
means first timer except for Tengah 5 room is sure get,btohqsg
Think it‚Äôs anyone with application rate < 1 will be entitled to a house,btohqsg
So the 1.7 (Cck 5 room)  1.8 (Tengah 5 room) and 1.1 (Kallang 4 room AND tengah 4 room) might still receive a queue number but there might not be sufficient flats,btohqsg
The only group that belongs to the ‚Äúsure get‚Äù category would be the 3 room PLMH applicants for Tanglin Halt Cascadia ‚Äî given that only 85 applicants applied for 155 units  together with other areas where the application rate is < 1,btohqsg
The real lottery is the order of the queue number and whether one gets to pick first or last.,btohqsg
155 units available 85 applicants.Those low rate like 0.2 (Queenstown 3rm) for first timer families. Will they give the remaining allocated for 1st timer to 2nd timers.If total q number given out is X3 of total flat supply then everyone should get a queue number right?,btohqsg
Yeah  first timer <1 is sure get,btohqsg
if all the PPVC (lego blocks) are 100% percent on standby with internal furnishes done  contractor utilize maximum resources to do piling  assembly and external finishes  less than 2 years  üòä,btohqsg
