Unfortunately not everyone has GXS Bank account.. so alternatively if@nil_sgpcan find a trusted person to open maribank can put 100k each for 2.88% p.a.,btohqsg
I guess you can say they have xnapped out,btohqsg
You need to be Malaysian in order to apply,btohqsg

Hi all  will it be better to tsf 55k to UOB ONE account on 2 May instead? Cos if tsf tonight then i will be losing interest in other banks and earning a low interest rate on 30 April for the 50k that i topped up. Please advise,btohqsg
can if the numbers work out for u,btohqsg
If you not registering for promo in Apr it'll work out for MAB in May.,btohqsg
I decided to register for the big savings payout promo. If top up 55k on 2 May still okay?,btohqsg
Register in apr fund have to be in apr  if u want to bring in may then register again in may,btohqsg
I think Apr registration  but funds in is up to end May,btohqsg
Need to be in same month as u register,btohqsg
U dont believe u reg apr then pump in may loh,btohqsg
I did today. I'm just referring to the image from UOB,btohqsg
You show this but you say up to end May. Contradicting,btohqsg
Cos still think the 4% is worthwhile,btohqsg
Isn't the centre column says end May?,btohqsg
The column say earmark by may not deposit by may,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s the earmark and cash credit date   depositing date is 30th April,btohqsg
I think people really need to read carefully and fully comprehend the tnc,btohqsg
I think they need English tuition,btohqsg
U cant fix brain with tution  it is habit  my friend fast read or dont read all the time,btohqsg
You can fix the comprehension of their english,btohqsg
Understanding is a process that can be sharpen but it cant be done if people dont think it need to be improve lol,btohqsg
I opt for cash + portfolio still show pending approval since Saturday,btohqsg
You just contradicted yourself here when you sent the picture of the t&c,btohqsg
I did too  started on Saturday deposit on Saturday  alrd invested,btohqsg
Wow thatâ€™s so weird how come,btohqsg
Cash credit is from UOB  not our deposit,btohqsg
"I submitted the form ystd. But i want to pump in in May. So the second form will over ride?There is an illustration example in the tnc but im still confused. It states ""last participation form submitted within the earliest qualifying period""",btohqsg
if Average balance mar is 100900 can top up 50k? or must more?,btohqsg
Yes. Your first registration earmarking will fail already so you have to submit again.,btohqsg
Yes  unfortunately I donâ€™t have GXS bank account and not sure how complex is to open one. Tnx for the suggestion,btohqsg
do you know what is the criteria ?,btohqsg
Last time grab platinum user used to get the invite faster,btohqsg
Once I press top up  it does not allow me to- says pending approval,btohqsg
Maybe itâ€™s missing information or just take some time to,btohqsg
GXS is by invite all along? Or is it a recent thing?,btohqsg
Ohhh donâ€™t rmb I had an invite,btohqsg
They notified through email and grab app.,btohqsg
Ohhh probably back then when the card was good,btohqsg
@kelvintaninvestwah look this guy trying to impersonate you sia HAHA,btohqsg
I went down to the branch personally and i was told the same,btohqsg
Any cashback cards recommendation for big ticket purchase. Probably below 5-6k,btohqsg
I went down to branch personally to do interbank transfer of CPFIA investments from DBS to UOB. UOB CSO told me I need to sell off everything and cancel the account with DBS (physically at DBS) then can open an account with UOB. ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚I went to DBS physically and they referred me back to UOB to open account and initiate the interbank transfer. ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚Don't think because they are physically in branch they are magically better.,btohqsg
Anyone know what is Tokopedia MCC? Its not on Heymaxx,btohqsg
Is True Cashback Amex the best card to input and save under Grab for highest cash rebate?,btohqsg
What do you mean input and save? Top-up Grab Wallet?,btohqsg
I understand what u mean but keep a picture of the queue ticket record the person name that is tending to u then if u dont get what u r promised write a formal email with all the evidences attached n appeal. It worked for me previously when i wasnt given the right info. But call in wrong info didnt work when i appeal,btohqsg
"I quoted what he said ""input and save for 1.5%"" hence i am clarifying. For top up it will only be 0.3% if i am not wrong",btohqsg
