the gurus please correct my understanding if im wrong as well. I think citibank restricts any paywave for any category for miles accumulation.

Not correct. Paywave is fine for certain offline MCCs. Point 6.https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/pdf/10x-rewards-promotion-terms-and-conditions-2020.pdf,btohqsg

Sorry I mean have to ensure SAL cat is fulfilled plus the min 200k together to achieve the 4+% interest,btohqsg
You only need sal and 500 increase to hit 4% at 100k in ocbc 360. At 200k  eir is actually lower than 4%.,btohqsg
200k is not worth. Better to put the extra 100k in other investment,btohqsg
200k has horrible EIR. Barely 3%+ p.a. only.,btohqsg
6% and 8% respectively PA returns. Paid monthly.,btohqsg

Hitting 10k monthly interest is actually possible with leverage.,btohqsg
Try to hit 500k AUM with UOB. Then will unlock portfolio financing. With 500k u can draw down 1mil funding. Can use to put into investment products.Imagine 1.5mil u throw inside 6%. U already earning 90k interest PA liao,btohqsg
Whats the cost of financing the 1mil?,btohqsg
The concept is good. But the choice of asset also important. Funds are not principal protected.,btohqsg
Lol. Not sure u know what is margin call or not. Just small fluctuations then you hit with it when u all in with margin.Plus you didn't factor in the cost of financing.It is workable but you mush have cash ready to cover the margin call possibility if in risk standpoint. Plus also too much concentration risk on the fund manager.The max risk is bigger than you think.It is not financial advice.,btohqsg
Do you mean with $500k AUM in UOB  UOB is willing to lend you another $1mil to put it in investment or unit trust? Then what is the interest charges?,btohqsg
5262 should be eligible for HSBC live+ no?,btohqsg
Very true. Need to have some spare cash to cover if need be,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s where HSBC EGA and/or Uob one comes in handy. Emergency cash to cover,btohqsg
Depends on your account size. For sgd now could be 3.5-5% pa.,btohqsg
