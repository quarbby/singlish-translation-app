Some apps can. But need pay quite a bit of money. In sg cause pdpa  so a bit hard to track by phone number. Such apps and software are banned asf. But what u can do is  u install a certain app on the person u want to track  then track from ur own phone. But im sure this way a bit lehchey la. Soooooo  track by phone number  need money.
