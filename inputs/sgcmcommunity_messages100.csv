Ur car taller than me wor,btohqsg
Who not use the OEM Toyota one? Or the castrol one  those are good.,btohqsg
Arguably  you wouldn’t need Amsoil or Motul…that being said  for the sake of argument…it’s purely a personal pref. Some like Amsoil  other’s live and die by motul.Both of them are good  Motul for obvious reasons have the higher budget to do a lot of marketing and a lot of development for their oil  but Amsoil is a really good oil that a lot of people use when running their cars.Penrite is also pretty good.,btohqsg
But er..save money lah boss  go get the Castrol Edge one. Good enough.,btohqsg
Tiagong Mobil also not bad  but some swear to keep away from shell helix,btohqsg

Just ARB won't solve this issue,btohqsg
Many will slow down before turning ba,btohqsg
Who turns with full speed ahead,btohqsg
But the Elantra not meant to turn so quick bah,btohqsg
This time not Elantra. It’s Honda fit,btohqsg
If he wants to corner flat  need better suspension also,btohqsg
It's the Honda fit roll over squad,btohqsg
Come out where? Got meeting together ah!!!!,btohqsg
Elantra wa scary. I feel car l8ke gna flip cus steering light,btohqsg
No la. My bro bought a Honda Fit,btohqsg
I got the low end spec one so cannot change mode :(,btohqsg
Do not mislead. Rollover bars aren't AntiRoll bars. But they are legal to be upgraded.,btohqsg
If you think think your steering isn't light on the Elantra,btohqsg
You need to drive more cars ma'am,btohqsg
Finding ways to get more cars to drive yo,btohqsg
If tio toto  any thing is possible. If not  I think BMX,btohqsg
The cn7 is a really good car in the segment,btohqsg
Rent car haha... or go car showroom test drive cars🤣,btohqsg
Not the best FC because not hybrid but it is still pretty good,btohqsg
And where did you source the car,btohqsg
"Mazda 3 interior v nice (only for front pax)... the rear is a bit ""meh""",btohqsg
Mazda the FC bad but I think the driving experience is good,btohqsg
😂😂😂 what car is that sia,btohqsg
Cannot base your experience on that ma'am,btohqsg
And it is the previous generation as well,btohqsg
And the Mazda 3s are PHV cars converted to GetGos  worst combo possible,btohqsg
What are you getting 6.8 on?,btohqsg
Bro its conti car 😂😂 conti fc never good,btohqsg
Let's just say I got a fat right foot,btohqsg
But idt its thaaaat good either haha,btohqsg
U nvr organise … meet who sia,btohqsg
That one roll cage like race cars use,btohqsg
No need to re fuel  just keep racing ah,btohqsg
Yea…I know. Too one sided point of view,btohqsg
Do you drive in the city a lot?,btohqsg
Noted  XF can get 10km/l min. with city highway mix easily,btohqsg
Mixed  best I got was 7.2 or 3,btohqsg
You compare to Prius of course not good,btohqsg
Forgot to tell you before eek,btohqsg
My one FC is damn bad,btohqsg
Lmao and mine is supposedly the best fc amongst its peers,btohqsg
I eco pro all the way sia,btohqsg
Similar but mainly for convertibles so that your head is protected by maintaining distance between head and ground if you flip,btohqsg
I use leg cycle the car 🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Tsk!! Where is the clutch then,btohqsg
Got a few  this the one my friend recco who has an XF also,btohqsg
Eco pro doesn't mean your FC will be better,btohqsg
Likely 6 to 8 km/l for a normal driver,btohqsg
Heavy foot like sirrick howmaybe 5 to 6 only,btohqsg
This one also good  many Bentley and Volvo peeps go there,btohqsg
My first tank only 5.8km/l but that was like fun drive,btohqsg
They actually have a clutch button on the wheel,btohqsg
Specs I think 65 but usually when I pump its 60l,btohqsg
Assuming you're referring to the 3.0 btw,btohqsg
Not the V8 or the 2.0,btohqsg
I tot the v8 is 5.0,btohqsg
That one heavy sia.  But ah.. supercharged ☺️☺️ love it,btohqsg
Also the 2.0 and 3.0 roughly the same FC,btohqsg
Because 2.0 lesser power but still need to pull same weight one,btohqsg
But nvr know .Supercharged 0 lag ..,btohqsg
Yeah mine 2.0 but drink like water,btohqsg
It is supposed to  cus my throttle was limited  so u aint suppose to rev so high. But im blaming it on city driving nowadays 😂😂 now my distance run quite short,btohqsg
Engine swaps aren't legal in Singapore,btohqsg
It is agreed  but if you're a heavy footer,btohqsg
You will see yourself rev higher in eco pro compared to comfort,btohqsg
I prefer to drive on sport,btohqsg
You try driving a bit more chill,btohqsg
I think you can get upto 10 easily,btohqsg
I ll be happy to do 8.5 😍,btohqsg
Maybe in a few months after I quit my job,btohqsg
After quit will be 100% me 😂,btohqsg
Wa ur co sponsor fuel for personal car?,btohqsg
No time to do Pte hire,btohqsg
No limit but they will see like if your mileage is expectionally high compared to others. Then invite lim kopi liao,btohqsg
I don't know  just pump only,btohqsg
There was one guy who did like 1000km every week for 2 months Striaght,btohqsg
Wa mileage damn high for a week,btohqsg
Yeah  rest of us only half,btohqsg
Leave bad name for myself for that little money,btohqsg
Idt i ever hit 1000km a week,btohqsg
The amt of scammers/bots nowadays is just too damn high,btohqsg
Heard amsoil not good. I show you a videohttps://vt.tiktok.com/ZS88kEcKv/,btohqsg
I use the silver version. O.ENow using F..K Massimo.Better FC  smoother  last longer too. After 10 000km  still smooth  don't fee heavy.,btohqsg
I usedmotul 7100And 300vfor motorbike many years. It's good But expensive 😅https://youtu.be/DY2pisnaI1IBut fail friction test in this video😅🤷‍♂,btohqsg
Don't need.Racing use.-High speed corner-GymkhanaIf your suspension bouncing  can change the absorber. KYB SR Special  etc.,btohqsg
okie. i'm asking on behalf of my bro btw,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/qhPi6QU7rq0See suspension play a big part.,btohqsg
wait. too smooth also cannot. end up doze off,btohqsg
sorry..i'm still very noob about the technical part,btohqsg
Once u start cannot stop one,btohqsg
Yah. After u do one  eh maybe shud match this with this to for a better drive/sound/looks/ experience,btohqsg
if i were a bit younger  then it's really tempting,btohqsg
Just drive at the speed your comfortable at!,btohqsg
Just change the absorberRear should be around $310+$50 to 60laborFront 500+ labor $100-150,btohqsg
lol change company pls. Good company pay for your singapore fuel,btohqsg
thinking if it's worthwhile to have it done at jb?,btohqsg
Not worth the time.Sometimes they don't carry the product.Sometime don't know it's real or fake. Product.Or kena upsell something you don't need.The price is about there in Singapore. Not really expensive 👍,btohqsg
There’s a triangle for these kinds of things…might not be the right triangle of things for workshops and car stuff but look at this and choose 2.In any case  your car is as much an investment as anything else. You’re spending a minimum SGD50k on your car. Is saving the extra $50-100  maybe even $200 doing it for cheaper worth it when you’re putting 50k at stake? You cheap out and do it for a bargain in JB  like other Aaron said  product may be used/refurbished/fake  you’re betting that savings you have that your investment into your car will pan out.,btohqsg
Its the time of the season alr....OH IT ALREADY DECEMBER 😱,btohqsg
Rather than anti-roll bar  why not do your suspension setup instead. My 51 year old granny can tackle that corner at 50 without an issue.,btohqsg
ARBs or sway bars would make the ride a bit too stiff if it’s just that alone,btohqsg

tested the C40 and it was indeed fast,btohqsg
What was it about something something cannot idle?,btohqsg
Can you review apple maps instead,btohqsg
If polestr precept were to arrive in sg,btohqsg

1st time buyer dare to buy the E60:),btohqsg
New bmw should not have that kind of issue ?,btohqsg
If the issues were not fixed on the day of handover,btohqsg
You can refuse to take handover and cancel the loan as well,btohqsg
Bmw can buy  but its just u need treat it with more care. In a sense  be a very sensitive driver,btohqsg
Not much room for tolerance I like to say,btohqsg
This one can enter JB not,btohqsg
I am confused. Who will pay over 100+k for a e60,btohqsg
singaporeans would do anything for a badge,btohqsg
No but a 523i e60 is a... 2007 car. Even a F10 523i 2010 can be found under a 100k,btohqsg
what doesn't add up? the fact that he got carrot,btohqsg
It’s not the fact he got a shit car,btohqsg
It’s the fact he paid too much for it,btohqsg
so he got carrot and lemon,btohqsg
this one is ownself shoot ownself,btohqsg
Not carrot. He mega loan out the wazoo,btohqsg
He nvr even do basic due diligence,btohqsg
at least he never full loan aveo,btohqsg
So many tell tale sign yet he still want to proceed. Wah bian.... 😂😂😂,btohqsg
u want cry to media but u also stupid,btohqsg
The dealer also promote 0 down,btohqsg
I have a feeling the 100k whatever is the inflated price showed on the papers,btohqsg
Lai evo X 3xxx per month who want,btohqsg
even our aveo friend is no decimal place,btohqsg
The 500 can use for repair,btohqsg
But I believe it's a full loan inflated price in the article,btohqsg
Precisely... something really not right. Asiaone also nvr do a simple due diligence and check prices,btohqsg
Asia one probably saw the purchase agreement which has the high price listed,btohqsg
Never give it a second look,btohqsg
Or ask the guy for his down payment,btohqsg
I kena covid noone interview me,btohqsg
i never see a insta page where their whole purpose is to glorify and promote full loan,btohqsg
Istg I think if 0 down dont exist,btohqsg
you never declare you got covid also,btohqsg
most used car dealers with a specific type of inventory heading that way now,btohqsg
Next time I kena covid  I email them,btohqsg
from lower end to higher end,btohqsg
Now bike also got 0 down  10 year loan,btohqsg
There is a target demographic for that.,btohqsg
just that they would be cheaper to buy on the used market,btohqsg

sg shud put law to max30% dp,btohqsg
and there would be more car sharing cars and rentals out there,btohqsg
this is a joke later the boomers flame me,btohqsg
also MAS rules say minimum 30% already,btohqsg
hence the inflated prices on purchase agreements for full loans,btohqsg
which is being exploited by some very well,btohqsg
just that many are making poor financial decisions based on it,btohqsg
or rather if sg full loan law was very very strictly regulated  car meet would be very empty,btohqsg

The key issues AsiaOne really need to ask in its research is the concept of zero down/full loans (should not have been glossed over) and worse  practise of “over loans” (loans above asset values) and the impact of it. It should not be legal but so far I have not seen a single court case being brought up.,btohqsg
How can there be court cases when the people taking over loans were ‘informed’ when they did it. Not so much know what their doing. Don’t think there’s any laws surrounding over loans is there? Guess the question is  who’d sue them for it haha,btohqsg
Not familiar with local laws but thought full loan technically wasn’t. Haiyah but what would rickshaw pullers know,btohqsg
