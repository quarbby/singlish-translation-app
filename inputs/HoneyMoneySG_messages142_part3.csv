Actually same question! What do they mean by ‚ÄòNo min spend is required for first month.‚Äô? Does that mean in Dec and Jan I just have to spend min 500 each to qualify for the 5% cash back? Cashback for the quarter given at the end (I forgot what I read for this üòÖ)?,btohqsg
But for the first calendar month the minimum spend is waived right,btohqsg
yeah thats what i understood too. that means we gotta hit min 500 in oct and nov to get the 5%. and okay i checked ‚Äî it says bonus cashback every quarteri read ontrust cashback siteandmilelion,btohqsg
hi  I am looking to get a new credit card for purchasing flight tickets + Hotel bookings.I am looking for a card that provides free airport lounges (preferably SIA as part of the list) and also a decent miles rate (maybe 1.5-2.5%).I've heard the DBS Women's World card is decent  also the HSBC Travel One card. Are there any other options? Which is the best in your(you guys) opinion?,btohqsg
Dbs women world card is decent for your use case.You wont find any credit card gives you lounge access to SIA. Those are reserved for KF gold/ people flying business/first class.,btohqsg
any recommendations on what card to use for buying air tickets to collect most amount of miles? around 1k-2k worth of air tickets,btohqsg
