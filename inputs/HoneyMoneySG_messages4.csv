How does it compare to InstaRem Amaze Card? Going to Malaysia for a month this February  still looking the best way to spend in Malaysia and earns cashback.,btohqsg
Just use instarem amaze with mastercard to earn 4mpd or 8% cashback,btohqsg
Cool. Will use it with my cashback then.,btohqsg
Anyway  anyone regularly transfer money to Malaysia here? Currently using CIMB SG to CIMB MY and use CIMB MY to pay off loans  but the exchange is not great. Not sure any better way. Any reccomendation?,btohqsg
Top up revolut with grabpay  send sgd to myr account.,btohqsg

Hi  can I Ask for those whose SA got 150k and above at age of 30 plus  all u all did was just do top of of SA ?,btohqsg
A mix of:Top up SATransfer OA to SAOverflow from MA when BHS is reached,btohqsg
Ohh I only started topping up last year :( arrr,btohqsg
I would prioritize MA first then SA,btohqsg
Oh I never top up my Ma,btohqsg
Regarding why MA before SA  i will do video about it next time,btohqsg
Ops I already top up my sa,btohqsg
So means I need to top up MA also,btohqsg
Can top up Ma again aft I top up sa,btohqsg
You can. Up to a combined limit of $8000 in 2022,btohqsg
If you did $8000 SA in 2022 then no more chance,btohqsg
Oh I already did top up 8k,btohqsg
For those wondering what are my YouTube member benefits. I'll talk about my ideas before the video is released. As you know video production takes some time so by the time the video is out  the information may have already changed. So if you keen to sign up  hop over to Youtube starting $3 SGD per month (1 bubble tea!). No obligations  quit anytime if you feel you aren't getting value,btohqsg
Can we top up more than 8k in SA   OA or MA?,btohqsg
can get family member to top up for me also right??,btohqsg
You can  but no tax relief,btohqsg
Ask your kids to top up for you  they will get tax relief,btohqsg
Since u have max out SA this year.  Will u top up 8k in MA next yr and it can be tax relief too ?,btohqsg
maybe will ask my wife to top up for me.,btohqsg
Not 8k  maybe only 3k. It is the gap of opportunity when the BHS is increased,btohqsg
Top up spouse only qualify if the beneficiary is not earning more than $4000 annual income,btohqsg
Otherwise  i top up for wife  wife top up for me  both get tax relief I think IRAS go bankrupt soon,btohqsg
Just work on reaching BHS with MA  the rest can think later,btohqsg
👌 still can enjoy the same tax relief like how we top up 8k to SA ?,btohqsg
is it in this order:1. Overflow from MA when BHS is reached2. Transfer OA to SA3. Top up SA?,btohqsg
1 and 2 can do together at the same time. 3 is last,btohqsg
"I did my cpf videos few months ago detailing my strategy for each OA MA and SA  can go look at ""Revealing my CPF"" videos 2021 may jun july",btohqsg
Of course the MA strategy needs to be updated now,btohqsg
So just shoot for BHS in MA first,btohqsg
do you top up every month or every year?,btohqsg
hello chris  once u reach frs and bhs  monthly salary will still split accordingly to sa oa ma ? does it mean that the excess at sa and ma will earn 4% and auto transfer to OA during YE ?,btohqsg
Once frs and bhs metOa go to oaSa go to saMa go to oa.Refer to the CPF Bucket and tap pic,btohqsg
Hi chris  do we vc3a also at the start of the year for self employed?,btohqsg
If I already top up SA 8k this year   Isit recommended to still top up the Ma to max it out this year ? Or wait till next year,btohqsg
I think that depends on whether you have other investment opportunities elsewhere.,btohqsg
Up to you based on your cash flow for self employed. But do earlier for compounding interest and tax relief,btohqsg
Wait till next year since no more tax relief,btohqsg
Ohh .. but SA less than 100k   ard 80k and MA 59k . So would u recommend next year how much to top up and to which acc?,btohqsg
VCMA max to BHS  remainder do RSTU,btohqsg
Next year Ma will increase again? Or stil at 66k,btohqsg
Every year will increase. Both FRS and BHS,btohqsg
if you watched the video  it's mentioned 3% YoY,btohqsg
FRS will be capped at the year you reach 55.BHS will be capped at the year you reach 65,btohqsg
Anyone bought SP500?Good time to go in now?,btohqsg
If you're asking this then you are timing the market and@boontee86will lecture you,btohqsg

Thank you!! My card just came,btohqsg
I use PRVI but not for Simply Go,btohqsg
i use PRVI for hotels  air tickets  utilities and to match cardup,btohqsg
lastly i use for big spending that cannot get miles with OCBC Titanium,btohqsg
Can SC Smart card do this hack too?,btohqsg
Hi  if this year my MA max to BHS  next year increase by 3 %  so next year need to top up again to max it ?,btohqsg
Yes. Because the interest earned on MA will carried over to SA or OA on 1 Jan,btohqsg
The tiger broker promotion that gives free Apple shares with first sgd2k deposit  does it imply while waiting for them to credit the free stock the acct cannot fall below 2k?,btohqsg

OMG! I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME!,btohqsg
Hi Chris  can I ask if this is safe as they require my IC and a selfie,btohqsg
This will be a 3 part series,btohqsg
I did not use nric or selfie  just singpass will do,btohqsg
I think it's the same for Hodlnaut  they randomly select a few who need selfie verification,btohqsg
I tried  they keep asking for my selfie and NRIC,btohqsg
I was told by Tiger that in addition to depositing sgd2k for 30 days  I need to do 10 trades then can withdraw the cash from the sold apple stock,btohqsg
Like I mentioned  it's random and sample check. I registered on phone,btohqsg
Yes  that may be the new requirements. cheapest just buy/sell 10 units of STI ETF (ES3),btohqsg
I am unaware! Is there any specific period Eg. Within 6 months that I have to complete 10 trades?,btohqsg
Hi Chris   which is a cheaper platform Syfe trade  tiger or MooMoo?Really no hidden fees?,btohqsg
Syfe trade is free 5 trades. I think that's a win  but limited to only US stocks,btohqsg
Possible to xfer CDP shares to tiger broker?,btohqsg
I wasnt aware too when I signed up. Only found out when I was trying to withdraw. I think no time limit.,btohqsg
HI@ChrisHMSGdo you use cash to invest with endowus? Your Fund Smarr S&P is cash or Cpf?,btohqsg
No cash with endowus  CPF and SRS only,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGdoes the hack apply to top up cro card for usage?,btohqsg
If cash is used why he will done it with endowus. U can simply go buy s&p 500 etf directly through brokerage which have minimal fees [commission and management fee],btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  for cash to buy S&P500 - which brokerage and counter would you use? Thanks.,btohqsg
Does the card hack apply to coinhako too ?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGwhat is your opinion on buying s&p500 using tiger fund mall?,btohqsg
Just bought s&p 500 etf will do...,btohqsg
Just buy VOO on tiger will do,btohqsg
Lion global Infinity us 500 on Endowus is because no other choice with cpf investing,btohqsg
No idea  not a coinhako user,btohqsg
I think SPLG can be a better option? It's almost the same as SPY but cheaper,btohqsg
just as the same reason why QQQM is better than QQQ for retail investors🤣,btohqsg

Yes. Just bought SPLG. If u have intend was to dollar cost average,btohqsg

"Anyway  see this argument in 1M65 group or cpf topic Everytime:""If you transfer OA to SA early  you lose out opportunity for tax relief by RSTU in future!""",btohqsg
Even another finance youtuber also mentioned it,btohqsg
Let me just put it out there that the rich and wealthy have more sophisticated way of reducing taxes and if you are relying on just cpf top ups  you don't deserve to be at their level,btohqsg
Will make a video on this,btohqsg

Looking to aim for a apple watch 🤭🤭,btohqsg
hi all! was watching chris' cpf videos  and wanted to ask something that i had problems understanding.1. if the total employer + employee contribution added up for the year is about 32k already  does it mean that i personally can only contribute up to another 5k+  and anything higher will not go through?2. if i hit the MA limit of 66k but normally my employer provides medisave topups of 100+ per month (i believe it might be under the Additional Medisave Contribution Scheme (AMCS))  will that be voided  or will the amount just flow to SA?Thanks all in advance :),btohqsg
Hi welcomeFor Q1  first if you haven't reach BHS or FRS  then you can still top up MA/SA since both are not subjected to annual limitQ2. If Bhs is met  MA will flow to SA if not at FRS yet. And flow to OA if already FRS. Refer to#cpf,btohqsg
thank you! is my understanding correct that I can still topup MA/SA up to the total 37 740 for the year  separate from the $8k topup to MA. But the voluntary topup for the former will not get tax relief?,btohqsg
Your understanding is correct. But no point to me since there is no tax relief and you could only do VC3A  according to the fixed cpf allocation % and not like target a single account,btohqsg
Hi I wanna ask about Revolut card.. How can I view the card details without creating a virtual card? I want to top up my CDC card but I can only see the last 4 digits of my Revolut debit card number on the app,btohqsg
sc smart only gives you 6% for the first month. luckily its annual fee free.,btohqsg
is there anywhere i can read on the benefits of using grabpay? apologies if it was discussed or posted before. thank you.,btohqsg
honestly i took the card more for the min spend no annual fee and its interest free 3 months installment,btohqsg
Recommend to just top up a lump sum straight to max out cpf ma in one shot ?,btohqsg
Tap on your revolut card number on the app  it should be able to reveal,btohqsg
Yes  so that interest start earning from Feb,btohqsg
Top up only if you have no other investment opportunity elsewhere.,btohqsg
Thanks  probably have to wait a while. It’s still not showing,btohqsg
I think i rephrase my comment. Just top up to hit the tax relief  don't top up beyond that,btohqsg
hihi  wish to check  how come all spending is 3.5%   but retail  dining  local  insurance  etc only 2.5% ?  For insurance  if it is paid by giro deduction does it mean will be total 3.5%?,btohqsg
@chris  can i know which is your go to credit card at the moment,btohqsg

Hi  may I ask for SRS  we are able to fund it using our CPF? Cus I’m abit confused after reading that for SRS contribution must be in cash. Thanks,btohqsg
SRS is srs. Cpf is cpf. Totally different.,btohqsg
No Sir  you cant. CPF is mandatory contributions (as long youre employed). SRS is voluntarily  google 'what is SRS' and read on it benefits or on why people top it up.,btohqsg
employed and Singaporeans/PR of course. Malaysian dont have CPF.,btohqsg
Yeah I understand the benefit of SRS contribution as it help with tax relief.,btohqsg
Anyone using DBS Altitude card? Wonder if the non-expring DBS point is any good. No minimum spending also.,btohqsg

Anyone has any advice on which Singapore 's robo to invest in? As there are quite a few options in the market,btohqsg
Depends on your risk appetite and find source (cash  srs  or CPF)… v hard to advice when there are so many options and we know nothing about you…,btohqsg
You can do a more indepth research on what the robo invest in. Which etf. And I tink ocbc also have robo even have more thematic portfolios that also include EV stocks   not just limiting to etfs alone.  Syfe also allow customisation on etf and also percentage allocation. So rly depends on individual preference.,btohqsg
Medium risk and using cash for the investment,btohqsg

Hi Chris  I've been revisiting your youtube videos on REITS. It seems their charts (Mapletree Log/Ind/Com  Keppel DC  Parkway) are identical i.e. downtrend towards a potential support. I've yet to invest in REITS and am thinking of using my SRS.,btohqsg
Is there some common event that resulted in this observation? Year-end  dividend payout?,btohqsg
Unless for tax purposes. See no reason at all to invest in Reits. Get a few percentage per year while having downside risk in property market even cpf sa have better risk reward ratio. Of course just my 2 cents. As I never see a investor billionaire invest in Reits before.,btohqsg
Thanks. Where will you park the SRS funds?,btohqsg
Hst [China tech etf] it might have more downside risk. But already quite undervalued overall.,btohqsg

I do not have EndowUs account yet  I checked their website  one can buy into Vanguard S&P 500 ETF via this Lion Infinity (Vanguard) US 500 Stock Index,btohqsg
Im using Cash with IBKR. For my SRS im with Endowus Lionglobal 500. Just looking for opinion as for my ibkr my personal take is CSPX due to save the 15% tax.,btohqsg
Ya  but can't do auto DCA monthly,btohqsg
yup i did that amd lumpsum my srs.,btohqsg
syfe trade has no recurring transfer yet. need to do manually.,btohqsg
Yes yes ... That's the downside.Maybe in future they will add on,btohqsg
Anyone here have compare s&p 500.Like voo spy splg,btohqsg
SPLG cheaper. More easier to people with lower income to dca,btohqsg
generally I would recommend$SPLG  it's cheaper and thus more flexible,btohqsg
How abt S27 based in singapore,btohqsg
there's some explanation why it's better than$SPY,btohqsg
SPLG may cause many veteran ETF investors to scratch their heads because State Street’s other S&P 500 fund — the S&P 500 ETF Trust  better known by its ticker SPY — is the oldest and largest ETF on the market. The 1993 debut of SPY pretty much established the modern ETF industry  and SPY is often touted as one of the most-traded securities on the planet. So why did State Street bother with a clone? There are a few reasons. Like other early ETFs  SPY was structured as a UIT  which means it lacks the flexibility to lend out shares and reinvest dividends. These factors are part of the reason why SPY’s management fee has remained persistently higher than upstart rivals like the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)  which helped those funds swipe market share from SPY. SPLG is State Street’s answer to that problem. SPY’s higher fee won’t deter short-term traders  who are more concerned with liquidity than fees  but for buy-and-old investors  SPLG is the better alternative.,btohqsg
VOO or SPLG  not much difference when talking about fractional investing.,btohqsg
Only when you want to buy whole units  then SPLG makes more sense due to lower pricing  can round to more units,btohqsg

Does anyone know if UOB Absolute card pairs / goes well with Crypto card like how it goes well with Grab Pay?,btohqsg
Article like this is why I think the Grabpay PayNow hack will be plugged soonhttps://bit.ly/3HZs141,btohqsg
Hahah! Sorry ah... I thibk you didnt answer my question 😅 currently does UOB Absolute complements the Crypto Card? Haha,btohqsg
You need to go through some hoops to make it happen ascrypto.comdoes not accept amex directly,btohqsg
How u get the grabpay card?,btohqsg
So Amex or Uob absolute better ?,btohqsg
U got referred link for the card ?,btohqsg
So Uob absolute better lah ?,btohqsg
Slightly better lah  0.2% more but AMEX more gifts,btohqsg
But I want to top up 30 k,btohqsg
Better get the Uob better right ?,btohqsg
Now topup still can for income tax ah,btohqsg
Ya if you want just one card. I would get both to get all the best rewards,btohqsg
Oh ya why I never think of that,btohqsg
Now top up is for 2022 income tax,btohqsg
Let say I pump 50 k to sa also got rebate using the card right ?,btohqsg

If have all these card with jade green crypto card. Effective cashback is how much,btohqsg
1.5/1.7% from Amex true cashback/UOB absolute + 3% (in CRO) from jade green card. Effectively 4.5/4.7%. Essentially makes all <=5% cards irrelevant if you spend <30k a year.,btohqsg
Just sad. I miss the trick for cpf top up. Didn't know about this.,btohqsg

Hi guys  im wondering between VOO and CSPX  does VOO 30% tax against ireland domiciled 15% tax matters for long term investments?,btohqsg
SP500 dividend yield is 1.27%  multiply 15% difference = 0.19%,btohqsg
Assuming compounding of 10% and (10% - 0.19% = 9.81%),btohqsg
Starting with 10k  the end value after 30 years are $174 494 and $165 675,btohqsg
I think another factor to consider is the inheritance tax  VOO will subject to inheritance tax which could be quite high,btohqsg
Yes. If something touch wood happened. Any US asset  It will incur inheritance tax of up to 40%,btohqsg
Thank you for this. Something that i need to read up more.,btohqsg
On the last part  does it means if you didnt spend on anything else youre not eligible for the cashback? Eg...you spend on online ordering of food  shoppings etc etc?,btohqsg

This year sa topup is 8k?,btohqsg
Thanks  may I confirm paying bills eg mobile also considered eligible?,btohqsg
Understood on that part  for groceries  petrol and dining you will get 8% cashback  provided minimum spending for the month is $800 right. Im not clear on what contribute to the minimum spending  is it only from the 3 listed above or anything that were use to pay using the card contribute to minimum spending (i understand exclusion of paying to govt institution  insurance etc),btohqsg
Ah from my understanding  Yes. Thanks!,btohqsg
Yeah correct it is in point 2,btohqsg
May I check for crypto com app where can I check my P&L? Thanks,btohqsg
Hi Chris  can you help explain the US Dollar FX Spread VS the Singapore Dollar FX Spread? I understand converting Singapore Dollar to US Dollar incrypto.comthere is a bit of fee but is it a lot? Cuz I use Grab to buy and I got 1.2% cashback  lol.,btohqsg
This question must direct to our Crypto guru,btohqsg
Basically Revolut have a better exchange rate  is it?,btohqsg
If so  how do I buy CRO or any crypto with USD instead of SGD incrypto.comapp?,btohqsg
Cuz like USD and SGD is same to me leh,btohqsg
Just to the conversion calculations . If it OK. Then buy directly. If not use ibkr with multicurrency account to save on fees.,btohqsg
After 30 days  even using a debit card to buy will incur the DCC fees  right?,btohqsg
U better askcrypto.comsupport to double confirm,btohqsg
Thank you so much for replying  I think I will rephrase my question as I think I ask wrong.Basically  the reason why Chris asked us to use Revolut card to buy crypto in USD is because  if  for example  I use GrabPay Card to buy any crypto crypto.comwill take my SGD  convert to USD  charge me a small conversation fee  before buying my crypto  am I correct?,btohqsg
Thank you so much for replying 🙏🏻👍🏻,btohqsg
if you wanna maximiseuse AMEX TCB or UOB Absolute topup GrabPay for 1.5 to 1.7% cashbackthen use GrabPay topup RevolutRevolut topupCrypto.com1.5% to 1.7% cashback beats the ambiguity of a 1.2% grab reward points redemption,btohqsg
Sorry  send wrong  anyway  yes  I actually use my UOB to top up my GrabWallet then use my GrabWallet to buy which earns me 1.7% from UOB Absolute and then 1.2% from Grab,btohqsg
But I think I still suffer a bit because of some fees and I also buy in SGD,btohqsg
I bought CRO by the way,btohqsg
Let say I already got a card fm Uob ! Then I apply for Uob absolute card   do i still get the welcome gift ?,btohqsg
Btw if you don't have Amex true Cashback before  can get that one first. 3% cashback for first 5000 spend,btohqsg
But if I top up 5000 to cpf,btohqsg
Can also get 3% cash back ?,btohqsg
AMEX TCB $5000 > Grabpay > Paynow QR to CPF,btohqsg

I watched it too! The dgaf part was very enjoyable to watch. Lol,btohqsg
"Everything u reply with "" dgaf""",btohqsg
Cannot DGAF everything also. Later 被权贵整死。,btohqsg
Like some Robo or Stock brokers that accepts Paynow QR funding,btohqsg
Will look at it but don't think I will put my money there,btohqsg

Updated my referral links (Jan 2022) in a separate channel. This link will also be shown at this main channel's description@sgpromocodehttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg

yes give it a try. it becomes more apparent 😊,btohqsg
Is there added benefit if sign up amex using referral?,btohqsg
there's probably some referral bonus. so look for your fav influencer or see which one has the highest bonus,btohqsg

Good afternoon Chris  may I know how to withdraw grabpay credits to my bank account. I can't seem to find it in grabpay app or I need to do it in the Amaze app?Anyway  thanks for the Amaze app intro and I have signed up using referral code.,btohqsg
Hi Chris 1. You did a video using a certain platform (is it Interactive Brokers?) to convert sgd to usd  and via versa. I couldn't find it. Pls give me the link here.2. I am currently using TD Ameritrade and they do not charge any commission for buying US stocks. But they charge USD25 per withdrawal. Does moomoo or tiger charges fees for withdrawal?TIA.,btohqsg
Just for u to take note ibkr have market data fee of about $10usd per mth.,btohqsg
So if u open ibkr account  they charge u usd10 each mth?,btohqsg
Thks JJ.If I withdraw USD from TD into my DBS multi currency account ,btohqsg
Which platform gives good rate converting usd to sgd?,btohqsg
IB give best rate. As it is fx rate.,btohqsg
Not all grabpay credits are withdrawable  only those funds topped-up from debit card or bank account. You should see your transferrable balance in Payment > Transfer,btohqsg
Moomoo/Tiger do not charge withdrawal fees but have poorer FX spread than IB,btohqsg
And there's no more 10 USD per monthof IB fee effective 2021,btohqsg
Here is the stockbroker specific videohttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGPaJVAewhc,btohqsg
Thks Chris. How is Moomoo/ Tiger FX rates as compared with DBS?,btohqsg
So no usd10 fees per month for ibkr?,btohqsg
Hi there. Can I check with the community on crypto,btohqsg
I understand that Christopher mentioned about using revoult card to top up CRO. Can we use YouTrip to do the top up without incurring additional fees ?,btohqsg
Moomoo tiger is better than dbs,btohqsg
YouTrip cannot be topped up by Grab  so there's no point in doing that,btohqsg
Any rewards for credit card > amaze > eAXS ?,btohqsg
I think us market data still apply?,btohqsg
If you dont subscribe  you dont get charge,btohqsg
You don't need live prices in IB anyway  can get from Tiger/Moomoo,btohqsg
When apply ibkr  it will auto subscribe?,btohqsg
As what chris said  can use Tiger/moomoo for live prices,btohqsg
Depends of whether u want to use it as a trading platform.,btohqsg
So if u use it as trading platform  there is live price fees?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if the standard chartered smart card cashback applies for mcdelivery?,btohqsg

Hi Chris  just like u  i have reached the BHS and FRS for 2022... is there any ways we can contribute n top-up some more funds into CPF accounts?,btohqsg
crypto is another world of investments which i have to relearn everything..,btohqsg
ETH  ETH v2  blockchain  smart contract  oracle  ... 🤪,btohqsg
My objective is not on tax but how can we add so that i can reach EHS b4 55,btohqsg
I will prefer cash then use it for investment. Fast better roi. Of course unless u are saavy in investment.,btohqsg
I have pull out from the mkt n reinvest in physical precious metals,btohqsg
Yes. Too many things to learn.,btohqsg
its like playing a RPG and uncovered a huge map,btohqsg
Chris can make some YT on DeFi,btohqsg
If you're not concerned on tax relief then just do VC3A.,btohqsg
For tax relief topup sa. Can it be done in separate batch in a year?,btohqsg
I started to use it for SRS,btohqsg
Hi Chris  are you able to do a video on how you reached FRS?,btohqsg
Anyone using UOB absolute cashback card for insurance premiums?,btohqsg
Oh ok. Read that they have .4 percen fees. Isnt that higher than using other platforms? Or they have certain pros,btohqsg
for cash investment  if you are okay with DIY then you can skip the fee  this is essentially intermediary fee,btohqsg
but for SRS and CPF e.g. investing into SP500 I think you can't invest via other platforms like IBKR or Tiger,btohqsg
U r correct. Tigr cannot use srs but local bkr such as poems can. So wondering is there any advantage to use endowus?,btohqsg
Thanks so much. Will be a good insight to it,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I understand from Pete from The Next Level Content Creator that we can use SRS to purchase the Canadian Bitcoin ETF.u got any info or research on this. Just to check.,btohqsg
this one need@ChrisHMSGto share his research,btohqsg
I used POEMS to buy 10 Units of S27 last week with SRS. Commission around 8 SGD.,btohqsg
POEMS referral at@sgpromocodeif you need one,btohqsg
I don't understand DeFi enough to make a video yet but KIV,btohqsg
Uob absolute > grabpay mastercard > insurance payment via AXS,btohqsg
I never heard of SRS able to buy any foreign domiciled product  let alone a crypto nature. But if that's true I would be happy to learn,btohqsg
Srs shld be all sgd. Listed in sgx.,btohqsg
I think if the product is (1) in SGD  (2) platform can access SRS  then you can purchase it with SRS. Use of SRS is not as restrictive as CPF OA/SA.,btohqsg
Yes. The purpose of srs is also to restrict funds from moving out out Singapore  in government perspective. That is why srs is also available for foreigner working in singapore.,btohqsg
Hi just a quz in syfe trade I buy US stock. How will I get my dividend paid to me ?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  usually how much margin did ibkr provide?,btohqsg
It is standard 100% margin for all brokerage.Which means example 25k have 50k stock buying power.,btohqsg
My endowus just got approved. However  I am still figuring how to buy into select funds directly using SRS. It keeps asking me to create Goals. If  for example  I want to monthly DCA into S&P 500 fund  how to do that?,btohqsg
You linked to your SRS account yet?,btohqsg
yup  linked already. Ok  after much tweaking  I found out how. Just have to create a goal  select fund  then allocate as 100%,btohqsg
thanks. are you doing monthly recurring as well?,btohqsg
planning to. just need to resolve the CPF-OA one-time investment first..,btohqsg
do you know where in endowus it shows the current nav price of the fund?,btohqsg
Have to go to fund manager page,btohqsg
However if you go cash out page that is the latest nav of the fund,btohqsg
For SRS  can also use Endowus to buy LionInfinity 500?,btohqsg
Select goal Fund Smart > Lion global Infinity US500,btohqsg
Personally which do u think is better? Dimensional or Lion?,btohqsg
Dimensional is a cheaper fund due to low expense ratio and it covers international companies.Lion us500 is US concentrated and slightly higher expense ratio but 2021 performance has been great for them.,btohqsg
Trying to do the same. Do u buy in SGD or USD?,btohqsg
small update can get apple watch se with citi bank card!,btohqsg
not all citi bank card tho only for the cash back+ cash back and premiermiles,btohqsg
Hi Chris  for IBKR  is it better to deposit SGD into the account then currency convert to USD? Or deposit USD straight into the account?,btohqsg
Anyone kept $10k in Tiq before? If you cash out everythinf and left only $50 the policy still covers you?,btohqsg
deposit sgd and convert on platform,btohqsg
Ok thanks BT.Does the IBKR account comes with margin already?,btohqsg
Default is cash account  you will need to request in order to convert to margin,btohqsg
so sometimes after you convert to USD you may not able to use the USD to buy shares immediately  back end they will need some time to settle it first,btohqsg
Looks like I need to find the place to request to convert to margin,btohqsg
TDA interest rate higher than IBKR,btohqsg
yeah need to configure the account first  answering  a couple of questions etc,btohqsg
Once you have margin  you don't have to wait for the cash settlement to start buying stocks. But please read up on the margin requirement and avoid leverage up your portfolio to the extend that you are at risk of liquidation,btohqsg
Agree with whatever Boon Tee said about IB. Just apply for margin for convenience,btohqsg
Can I transfer my stocks from moomoo & poems over to IB?,btohqsg
I just wired $10SGD into the account  does it take time to settle it as well?,btohqsg
do you guys discuss US stocks here?,btohqsg
Better to just sell your holdings there and buy back at IB  less hassle,btohqsg
IB takes a few hours to deposit  but usually same day if it is a working day,btohqsg
You can post a question and see if there is any taker,btohqsg
"but please don't ask vague questions like""What do you think of TSLA stock""""Why market drop today""I think all these are really low dimension quesitons",btohqsg
I deposit SGD inside IBKR  it seems that there are 2 accounts  1 for USD and another for SGD?,btohqsg
S$10 is too little$2 usd to convert per transaction,btohqsg
Hi Chris  am I right to say that for the current promo running on singsaver for AMEX True cashback card  to fulfil the $500 min. spend requirement  I can just top up $500 to Grab? Understand it is 1 of the few cards that still gives cashback for topping up Grab?,btohqsg
The exclusion list is rather vague or maybe I am not too familiar with the terms they use,btohqsg
Short answer is yes  grabpay is eligible,btohqsg
Unlisted my Cryptodotcom video from public. Due to MAS trying to control their marketing efforts. In case anyone is wondering,btohqsg
But the referral link is still working,btohqsg
Does ibkr web portal always lag?,btohqsg
You can use their platform instead. If u do scalping/daytrading. Then ibkr is not suitable.,btohqsg
Ibkr is quite good compared to others. Try the others and you will find out why real soon 😂,btohqsg
Should I use their desktop application or just the web portal will do?,btohqsg
You trading or normal buy and hold?,btohqsg
Install their application will be better. Lot more function,btohqsg
Ibkr more for swing trade and invest.,btohqsg
Normal buy and hold.Option trading only.,btohqsg
You need live prices for options. Go to IBKR chat to find which type to subscribe. I think someone asked recently only for option live data package recently,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGHey Chris  some fake FB account with your DP is trying to add your viewers/followers  please do issue precautionary notice.,btohqsg

Page already taken down after I reported it,btohqsg
But there could still be more,btohqsg
Thanks for the swift action taken.Once again  I urge everyone not to click on unknown links or accept any offers not coming from my official YouTube  Instagram  Facebook and Telegram Channel.,btohqsg
I beg to differ  IBKR is mostly laggy when the US Market starts,btohqsg
I've to keep refreshing until the page is up,btohqsg
I have been using ibkr tws. No such problem,btohqsg
question  can we use Syfe for SRS? Or which recommended SRS platform are there? (Endowus)?,btohqsg
I have transferred money to IBKR yesterday  but up till now  not reflected in the web portal. Does it always take so long?,btohqsg
Not for syfe. Can try Endowus,btohqsg

Pardon me  some qns to clarify:1) 1% Cashback given by EGA 1% should go to the EGA bank account right?2) Called HSBC  they said 1% Cashback from EGA is for giro paying utilities  Telco bills etc  not for payment of any credit card. Is this true or HSBC mistake?3) What's the Cashback limit of advance card with EGA? Still $70? Is yes  that means spending limit to enjoy 3.5% is $70/3.5%=$2000 only.,btohqsg
YesNot true. Got $4 back for $400 cc bill payment$2000 is the sweet spot,btohqsg
Btw please don't call bank and tell them about those hacks that work  this will just kill it,btohqsg
Think they also know. They just wait until more ppl subscribe to the card and kill it at later stages,btohqsg
Mine if i ask the cc bill payment can be for other banks' CC as well right? not only HSBC advance cc,btohqsg
Any one know what to will happen if CPF never reach BRS . Example reach 55 and Ra and SA combine only  have 90k what will happen?,btohqsg
YOu can still have payouts after you opt for payout at 65,btohqsg
and you still can withdraw 5k if you want too  which is not advisable unless you can reinvest at a higher rate,btohqsg
I mean eligible for CPF plan at a pro-rated?,btohqsg
amount of pro-ration suggest can just make a call  the officers can make an estimate at best,btohqsg
What I understand is if you hit 195k FRS and you start to draw out money from it every month 1350 at age 65 you will be in CPF life plan.  just touch wood if you happen to gone at 67 and will the rest of money return or it will go back to the CPF life pool?,btohqsg
not too sure on it  think you can check this questions seems like those in FAQ coverage,btohqsg
My understanding is you will not be enrolled into CPF Life but fall into the old plan,btohqsg
Maybe this situation is when most of your OA is locked up with housing. Scenario1) Sales of HDB  the proceeds will fall back to OA and then automatically transferred to RA to fill up the gap. Scenario2) Decide to do a cash housing refund  the process is the same as #1.,btohqsg
I have just paid my insurance premium via uob absolute > grab wallet > axs > income.Absolute give us 1.7% rebate in the following month statement.How do we earn the rebate from grab? Can anyone advice?,btohqsg
Regarding those CPF Life questions  you can ask in the 1M65 group instead. I haven't done much research on that because  it is a very long time later and policies might change by then for me. But those experts at 1M65 will have the answer,btohqsg
You don't earn Points for Insurance payment  so 1.7% is the max,btohqsg
Unless you want to play the UOB One game  5% cashback at 2% fee via ipaymy/Cardup = net 3% cashback,btohqsg
Thks Chris. 1.7% is better than nothing :)I am paying my annual premium. So uob don't work for me.,btohqsg
And grab only allow max 5k in the wallet  under the new govt policies.,btohqsg
You can split the payment to multiple 5k. Cap at 10k per month and 30k per year.,btohqsg
Yes I will have to do another payment tomorrow. Btw  grab allow us to top up to the nearest dollar... which mean i cannot top up my wallet to 5k if i have balance cents. ;),btohqsg
Haha Ikr. But I did 4950.,btohqsg

hi  for syfe wealth  i have choose wrong portfolio to custom instead and now at the sign and proceed page. is there any way to cancel and go back to main portfolio again? i want to choose equity 100 instead,btohqsg
Just youtube  Google search b4 u ask.....,btohqsg
I did the creditcard method  there was a dynamic conversion fees etc.,btohqsg
Not sure if I did it wrongly,btohqsg
DO NOT buy using credit card. there's lot of fees charges by your bank. don't mislead by the app saying zero fees,btohqsg
Is best cpf strategy to max MA  then max to FRS (why not ERS?) and maintain 60k in OA (for the extra interests)? For those say 50 or older??,btohqsg
You cannot top up to ERS before 55  so only up till FRS. 60K OA is not required. I keep 20k just so I can invest the OA amount above 20k,btohqsg
Will your strategy after 55 be max MA  max ERS and maintain only 20k in OA 40k SA.  Since the first 60k in OA + SA attracts additional 1%?,btohqsg
Tapering not started panic selling occurred,btohqsg
Hello! If you have not transfer any money in  you can just ignore that portfolio and create the correct one  which is you'd eqty100,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  I just watched most of your Syfe  Endowus and credit card video. From what I understand  your cash back need to be higher than the credit fee in order to make “profit”.I’m a working adult  with below average spending. Other than the new credit card user bonus  is there a reason for me to get a credit card?,btohqsg
Let’s take cash back  every time we spend money credit card fee is 3%. So our cash back has to be higher than 3% for it to make sense?,btohqsg
I let the community answer this.But there's no 3% fee in normal merchants,btohqsg
Get one that matches your lifestyle.,btohqsg
I'm trying to understand my lifestyle also,btohqsg
My company sometime required me to take grab for work  spending is between $50 - $700 a month  very volatile so can't rely that to hit minimum spending amount. Initially I thought can use AMEX True saving to top up grab wallet and earn the unlimited 1.5% cashback. But AMEX transaction fee is between 2.5% to 3.5%. I'm still losing money.,btohqsg
You don't need to pay fees using AMEX top up grab,btohqsg
Is it? Sorry  I don't have CC yet. But a lot of my friends say they don't use any credit card to top up grab because of the fee.,btohqsg
That's the case for VISA cards,btohqsg
I know Visa need to pay $1 per top up if value is less than $400.,btohqsg
So when does the transaction fee really occur?,btohqsg
I concur with the first two  with the current policy now.Disregard the 20k oa 40k sa since once you reach 60k SA/MA  you will get that 1% capped,btohqsg
When you shop at merchants that prefer to take in cash and charge a premium 3% fee on credit card payments. E.g. IT Show  certain Mobile retailers,btohqsg
Only when you top up with a VISA card,btohqsg
Transaction fee?? I think u mistaken for fx fees. If u buy from overseas. Most credit card charge fx fees.,btohqsg
I’m here to seek some clarification with custom portfolio with Syfe Custom and Endowus Single Fund portfolio. With Syfe Custom  the platform fee is 0.65% if total invested value is less than $20K  followed by 0.5% from $20K to <$100K  0.40% above $100K and lastly 0.35% for above $500K. With Endowus  the fee is 0.6% for <$200K and 0.5% for $200k to $1M.,btohqsg
I know in the beginning of@ChrisHMSGrobo advisor journey video  He mentioned that Syfe is a better option to invest with cash. But now with Endowus Single Fund fee of 0.3%  is Syfe still the better option to for cash investment  or this is just happening to custom portfolio?,btohqsg
Transaction fees is not for us . It's merchant have to pay amex not us.,btohqsg
I should clarify that for Small amounts DCA  Syfe is a good option as no commission fee and no FX conversion fee  which can be a huge % if the DCA amount is small. Once portfolio size is larger  always better to go with brokers like Tiger/Moomoo/IB,btohqsg
investors and traders believe an action that will happen in the future so that they can buy or sell shares,btohqsg
Oh yes  i see the max MA is now 63k > 60k so we can ignore the 20 oa and 40 sa  so after 55  if the MA is say 63k in 2022  then transfer all OA and SA to achieve ERS? Or use cash to achieve ERS?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  Lets use a real case. Assuming at age 65 the MA is at max 63k in 2022  OA is 74k  and SA is 3k  and RA is only 177k (not at FRS of 192k)  step 1 would you use OA or cash or a combination (assuming still working and can get tax relieve RSTU and MA top up of total 8k a year now) to top up Cpf Life to FRS of 192k first… then step 2 remaining OA towards ERS and thence 8k a year RSTU. Would you agree this is likely the best strategy? Now to determine whether to use all cash  or all OA or what combination of OA and cash to reach FRS of 192k (from 177k),btohqsg
Since you already have RA  make sense to just go for cash top up first to get tax relief,btohqsg

Is it much cheaper to buy ETF via moomoo/tiger than via Endowus/Syfe?,btohqsg
A basket of ETF. Broker you can buy specific ETF,btohqsg
you want cheap  IBKR is the best,btohqsg
but will take a bit of learning,btohqsg
coz setup account  convert currency  buy  all these you DIY,btohqsg
Endowus also can buy specific unit trust (e.g. tracking S&P500 index),btohqsg
the main selling point is convenience  you automate bank transfer then everything they do for you (FX exchange),btohqsg
Ya..heard ppl using IBKR to short shares..,btohqsg
Oh yeah Endowus can buy specific  Lionglobal. Syfe/Stashaway cannot.,btohqsg
Ok..seems like Stashaway n Endowus r the more popular ones,btohqsg
I believe this question only answered half. I just applied for the AMEX True Saver with the flash sales. So I can just transfer $5000 to grabpay and be eligible for the 3% cash back plus the reward of ipad 9th Gen?,btohqsg
I know $5000 3% is the AMEX side. But the singsaver promo need to spend $500 to redeem the gift. Does the $500 follows AMEX eligible spending list?,btohqsg
I simplified it. Cpf use endowus [monopoly] . Srs use fsmone [almost monopoly. Most etf and fund for it] Cash use ibkr. [most value for money for common investor],btohqsg
Generally  I guess so. But highly recommened that you spent several mintues reading their T&C,btohqsg
Does anybody know what will happen to your accrued interest resulted in using CPF OA to pay for your house loan when you reach the age of 55? If you hit FRS at age 55  can we withdraw our remaining money though the accrued interest is still outstanding?,btohqsg
Usually if one use the OA for housing  it will be quite difficult to build SA to FRS? Unless one always VC every year and salary range is at the max cap I presume?,btohqsg

I have a co brand Amex card with Dbs … now I apply this Amex card   do I still get the welcome gift if I spent more than 500 $ ?,btohqsg
Buy some value growth stocks using DCA if can..,btohqsg
Yes. Cobrand cards with dbs or uob are not considered amex customer,btohqsg
Likewise  you are paying to dbs/uob during bill payment for these cobrand cards,btohqsg
If able to have extra cash  can do a cash refund to HDB to clear or bring down the OA amount used. Thereafter can transfer fr OA to SA. This is another way to build up SA.However you have to weigh whether you have enough emergency funds or need short term funds along the way.,btohqsg
"Coming back to your qn. In the event you have reached FRS and still has AI from HDB.1) the AI will still snowball until the day you refund all to OA back (capital + AI)2) upon reaching FRS amount and RA created  whatever in OA or SA can be retrieved. However most people use it as some form of ""FD"" by not taking out.",btohqsg
Can i ask whether it is true that you do not need to repay back the AI when you reach FRS at age 55? Only time you need to repay back is when you sell your HDB?,btohqsg
What's wrong? It works fine for me.,btohqsg
Instarem Amaze cashback is in  you all should receive a notification from the app,btohqsg
I can't seem to log in,btohqsg
Same here. Instarem seem to be down,btohqsg
Everyone wants the cashback now lol,btohqsg
It's ok now. Their trade platform last night hang and unable to connect. All my trades stuck  buying at market price all show pending  cancelling also say pending cancellation. The online CSO unable to do anything. Scary.,btohqsg
"No rules for paying back AI at all times.It's only a matter of whether u want to accumulate it till u sell off the HDB or whether u prefer to clear it and let the gov pay u the 2.5% instead of ""taking it from the profit sales of the flat""Scenario 1) new BTO should still be able to cover the capital + AI when u decide to sell off as there will be a long period of time before it decays.Scenario 2) if u buy resale  price of HDB when u bought ultimately may or may not be lesser then what u bought for when u decide to sell. So in this sense  if u sell off  the so called profit will ""bite"" into the sales  as compared if u clear off the capital + AI.",btohqsg
For insta amaze card  when is the cadhback reflected? how many days after purchased? got my card a week back have use about 2k++ on groceries dinings etc but yet to reflect in my cashback... still 0,btohqsg
Cashback will be paid out on the 25th of the month after each quarter. For example  you got your Amaze card a week back (i.e. during Jan)  your cashback will be reflected/paid out only after the first quarter of Jan-Mar (i.e. on 25 April),btohqsg
Take note max cashback / quarter is $100 (or 1% of $10000)  unless Amaze runs some additional promo,btohqsg
there are additional caveats like:- each transaction must be at least $5 to qualify as an eligible cashback transaction; and- min spend of at least $500 / quarter to qualify for any cashback payout,btohqsg

What value have you provided before you threw your referral code here?2) If I allow you to share your code here  other people will ask why they cannot share as well.

@ChrisHMSGhow come  recently mapletree reit suddenly drop so many,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGif used moomoo how to use the dividend add in the share price?,btohqsg
But there is a option at grab to transfer to bank account isnt it?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI see the news said  American will add interest not only 1 time  maybe 3 time  like this reit price will drop 3 more time? 😂,btohqsg
Use this way can still top up ?,btohqsg
So cannot  use grabpay to scan cpf QR code anymore ?,btohqsg
Market already knows this  but whether drop 3 more times is anyone's guess,btohqsg
Why need to topup grab first then topup revolt?,btohqsg
I top up grab to hit the 5k.I top from grab to revolut to take out the 5k to pay the bill.,btohqsg
Wow. Nice hack. Dont need to lock the money inside grab pay wallet,btohqsg
But please note there is a limit for grab top-up.,btohqsg
Now for grab  you can paynowQR too. So if you have amex-uob absolute card  and your merchant does not accept credit card but has paynowQR  you can still earn 1.7% cashback indirectly by topping up grab wallet with amex uob absolute and scan the qr to paynow your merchant,btohqsg
can be useful when you are doing house reno  when M&E contractors etc do not accept credit card but have paynowQR,btohqsg
but take note of the 30k annual top up as per Mr Jack message above.,btohqsg
for grab paynowQR payments  no grabrewards tho. but you still get 1.7% cashback from UOB-AMEX absolute top up to your grab wallet at least. better than getting nth from your usual paynow/fund transfer.,btohqsg
Topup revolut 5k direct dont count as hit 5k?,btohqsg
Revolut don't accept amex for now.,btohqsg
Any fees to withdraw from revolut to bank and how many days it takes from revolut to bank?,btohqsg
Noo fees . You will get the next seconds you send.,btohqsg
