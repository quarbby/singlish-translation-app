(Ie MSc is medical physics)If so  do u recommend taking a theoretical physics degree or go for the applied Physics (AP) route?NTU recently introduced Major in AP  w 2nd Major in Medical Physics Whereas NUS has a BSc in Physics w Minor in Medical PhysicsAny advice?,btohqsg
I dunno how is life there but I know it's q hard to find a good paying job (source my cousin's bf),btohqsg
Omg why didnt i think of that,btohqsg
Imagine climbing up a ladder so high + carrying heavy boxes,btohqsg
The resultant clockwise moment gonna  send me to the ER,btohqsg
It feels like high elements tbh,btohqsg
This one isn't about Physics now. It should be about workplace safety.,btohqsg
Its abt physics and workplace safety üëå,btohqsg
Workplace safety first. If it is not safe  don't do it.,btohqsg
It is safe if i do v slowly,btohqsg
But ngl i kinda feel abit betrayed after person told me there will be restocking too despite its notice saying temp taking only,btohqsg
But pay is good so heh,btohqsg
