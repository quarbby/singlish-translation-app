lets say you have 15-20k saved. Is it ok to invest and save at the same time to reach the 100k or better to focus on purely saving the first 100k first,btohqsg
No right or wrong  depends on investment risk appetite,btohqsg

hello everyone!I have a question regarding paying for recurring GE insurance monthly payments.I am currently charging my GE annual insurance premiums to my OCBC cashflow card because they allow splitting of these annual premiums into 12 months of monthly repayment with a 1% processing fee (otherwise  I will be paying one big sum in one shot). however  I feel like I am not optimising my ability to earn either cashback or miles (or both) in this manner.I would like to know if there's anyone in the same situation as me (i.e. breaking up yearly GE insurance premiums into monthly payments) and how you are optimising your ability to earn either cashback or miles (or both) using either Cardup or Ipaymy.,btohqsg
Usually the annual premium savings outweigh the cashback/rewards earned from markup charged on monthly premiums. Have to do your own cost vs benefits analysis,btohqsg
Amaze must be linked to wallet not credit cards.,btohqsg
Hi  is the 1% giro cashback (hsbc ega) not working again? Had giro payment on Friday  but hvn‚Äôt received the cashback. Usually it is in the next day regardless if it‚Äôs wkend or not.,btohqsg
No leh  it can be up to 14 working day to be credit,btohqsg
Mine is always in the next day .. never failed except for that time when they were hving issues,btohqsg
Just because it is in next day doesnt mean it cant take up to 14 days. Just be patient lah,btohqsg
hello.. i have met the $800 on SQ spend criteria few months back. when will the criteria for 3mpd for any spend under UOB KF reset?,btohqsg
I was just wondering if anyone else has same issue  if not then all good.,btohqsg
so if credit report shows account opened on 21/12/23  means reset already right?,btohqsg
hi Chris  i have been recently interested in miles chasing. have been watching your videos and other finance influencers. Since there are quite a lot of changes recently  which is the best miles chasing credit card as of now? thanks.,btohqsg
ah ok  got it. i've watched your videos and came across one that talks how to pay insurance and earn cashback  and i was wondering it applies to the GE-OCBC cashflo type of insurance (i.e. yearly premium but broke up into 12 month installments),btohqsg
Uob visa signature and uob lady solitaire if you qualify,btohqsg
thank you. uob signature vs prvi vs krisflyer? which would you choose?,btohqsg
will study the uob ones. thanks!,btohqsg
Can be up to 14 working days.,btohqsg
You can check GE-OCBC Cashflo card t&c. It would be better to just pay annual premium 1 shot and get 1% GIRO cashback from HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
Hi guys. I would like to check. Anyone use ocbc infinity card pair with cardup to pay income tax? Will it be counted as transaction for the monthly ocbc360 minimum $500 card spending. I would like to do this to hit the monthly spending for the bonus interest.,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt looks worth the $$ to pay using this card but you can consider paying utility and cash card it also qualify under $500,btohqsg
The 0.6% bonus interest on ocbc360 can cover the fee. Plus 1.6% cashback. I also plan to use HSBC EGA to giro pay credit card bill. It's a long payment route but I think it would work,btohqsg
In ocbc infinity card TNC  utility not consider as transaction. So I think it not count into spending.,btohqsg
May I confirm with any expert here on  mcc8043 opticians is NOT under Citibank exclusion list right?,btohqsg
base on past experience   will it better now i open OCBC360 year end promo for the 2% additional for first two months? or wait next year Jan/Feb new acc opening promo? Thank you very much...,btohqsg
