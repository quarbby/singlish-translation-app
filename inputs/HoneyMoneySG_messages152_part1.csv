AXS is excluded by most banks for earning rewards  doesn‚Äôt matter what you pay for.,btohqsg
Don't give wrong info pls... Sat is immediate unless it is a PH.,btohqsg
BTW just to provide dp on same day transaction...For mastercard contactless transacted around 12noon  7-11 and giant both are not posted on the same day  contrary to popular belief.,btohqsg
YeapIt is a misnomer that it is guaranteed. It all depends on when the merchant settles‚Äô the transactionAlso depends on which bank is the acquiring bank of the merchantIs same bank UOB to UOB or DBS to DBS  there ya shift chance but not guaranteed.,btohqsg
Ocbc mastercard. But it doesn't matter. I've provided screenshot previously on my uob one spending at giant also showing not the same day posting if you remembered. It's really weird. Let me dig it out.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/245022,btohqsg
Thats weird. Usually uob cards on uob terminals will be posted same day.,btohqsg
Oh  I used the self check out counter at giant for my uob one spending back in Sep (see link above). Not sure if their self counters also using uob terminals?,btohqsg
Physical or contactless has no impactIt is when the merchant settles,btohqsg
I thought cimb starsaver is better than cimb fastsaver?,btohqsg
Yup unless cash amount is big...,btohqsg
Always a hit or miss. That's why never do last minute spends  especially during holiday season.You won't know if merchant's back office working or not,btohqsg
As calculated  have hit the target. ü§≠,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think it needs back officeBut yes last few days always never guaranteed.,btohqsg
I have to choose the moomoo cash rewards within 30 days but can't seem to find the option to do so. does anyone knows?,btohqsg
Good morning gurus  could I confirm my understanding. I just received my uob lady's card. As I am switching from uob one card to the lady's card hopefully to clock miles for biz class ticket. I would like to seek your advice on the following please:1) should I switch my recurring phone and utilities bills to uob kf card? I think I can't accumulate miles by charging it to the lady's card as I have chosen family for my category.2) any recommendations to clock miles using other cards for utilities bills please?3) should I stick to uob one card for the rebate instead?At the same time  would you have any recommendations for public transport for miles please as I would unlikely want to change the category for my lady's card. Thank you so much in advance. üôèüèª,btohqsg
Sorry not back office but when the merchant does closing (pushing capture on POS terminal). 24/7 is the riskiest because they may do closing only after midnight.,btohqsg
Already past 30 days after deposit?,btohqsg
im using uob one and citi rewards  is there any card can replace uob one ?,btohqsg
replace uob one for what purpose?,btohqsg
i now using uob one for monthly 500 (sp bill + transport + etc) to get cashback  + bank account interest,btohqsg
uob kf excludes utilities. uob one card is the best card for utilities and public transport,btohqsg
YeapCutoff is well before midnightSome is late afternoon while other is early evening,btohqsg
er so all switching to poems for SRS and OA investment?,btohqsg
Has anyone received the cashback for YouTrip December promo? Supposed to receive by 31 Jan if you're the first 15k to qualify.https://www.you.co/sg/youtrip-year-end-cashback-2024/,btohqsg
hi  do yall know how to make insurance payments with UOB absolute card? axs doesnt accept amex cards,btohqsg
only if the insurance company accept amex. Think only for some allow amex for one time payment like travel insurance,btohqsg
CardUp with fee  possibly no rewards depending on card t&c,btohqsg

Oh thank you I saw in a previous post talking about using uob kf for utilities. Maybe I misinterpret it. Maybe I would need to combine uob one and lady's card.,btohqsg
ok but still need min 500 spend in statement month on uob one card to get rebate,btohqsg
Awesome thanks! Will switch to my DBS wwmc for payment then!,btohqsg
I am trying to add the Maybank fnf card to my google pay. but it keeps telling it is not supported. does any one meet the same issue?,btohqsg
Maybank can be added to ApplePay and SamsungPay only,btohqsg
This looks like a scam website. Don‚Äôt use,btohqsg
Workaround for you. Add Maybank FnF to Amaze and use with GooglePay,btohqsg
Hope you are not serious ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
No legit website will put numbers in their name. Most likely scam,btohqsg
just an example. my understanding is taht amaze only turn transction into online. but MCC doesnt change. so I can still use googlepay/amaze to tap the gantry for MRT/Bus to earn transport right?,btohqsg
I thought he was joking as well lol,btohqsg
But don't forget the $1000 limit on Amaze local transactions.,btohqsg
need to feedback to maybank to add support for google pay haha. didn't expect it doesn't support google payüòÇ,btohqsg
I'm obviously joking LMAO. Who doesn't know Maybank,btohqsg
Oh I can't combine the spending on uob one card and lady's card?,btohqsg
UOB One card cashback is based on UOB One card spend,btohqsg
can combine for uob one account 500 spend but not for uob one card rebate,btohqsg
Oh ok thank you. I would only use the uob one card for public transport and utilities bill. I would need to let go of the cashback for miles üò¢,btohqsg
Use a different card with no minimum spend if you can't hit,btohqsg
a little follow up. is there any place in amaze app to check out how much local spending already?  I was linking amaze to CRMC only. didn't care about it,btohqsg
u able to clock enough spend to have enough miles to redeem biz class? if not better stick to uob one cashback,btohqsg
I saw there is a total spending. but not sure if it counts local/oversea together?,btohqsg
