They stopped offering delivery and online orders the day they onboard FP,btohqsg
can spend even before that so long posted in the calendar month,btohqsg
Hi  for uob one account. I have uob lady card and also uob one card. If let's say i spend 200$ on uob one and 300$ on uob lady. Does it consider hitting the 500$ minimum spending requirements. Or i need to do it with 1 card,btohqsg
hi  for the UOB rising dragon promo  my balance for 31 dec is 0.If I sign up on 02 Jan and top up 100k on 02 Jan  is this sufficient? Or do I have to top up more to account for 01 Jan which was a PH such that ADB is >100K?,btohqsg
"Hi all  referring to this. I have put the $4k in on 31 Dec 2023. currently now still shows ""You have pending investments"" am i able to withdraw the investment given that it is already 2 Jan 2024? or would I probably need to wait till the amount has been invested in before can sell?",btohqsg
Hi all  if my statement date is 2nd of every month  when will my new statement start? On the 2nd of 3rd of every month?So for my cashback is it calculated from 2 Jan to 1 Feb or 3 Jan to 2 Feb? Thanks in advance :),btohqsg
Can do with multiple eligible uob cards like lady  evol  uoboneBut u wont meet the uobone card benefits. Why not clock that 200 to uoblady.At least  it still give you 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
Assume that $200 u charging to uobone is not your selected category for uob lady 6mpd,btohqsg
Coz the lady card i just got it. Totally forgot bout the uob one card 500$ minimum spending. Will cancel that card then. Thanks!!!,btohqsg
Make sure its $0 before 30 Dec 10pm to consider 31 Dec as $0..,btohqsg
posted transactions from 3rd Jan to 2nd Feb,btohqsg
for the promo it should suffice to top up 100k over your 31 Dec balance. Your 31 Dec balance likely have at least base interest and not $0.But to maximize the interest you need to reach $100k ADB e.g. topup 100 000/30=$3333.33 extra on 2nd Jan,btohqsg
hello  will the money set aside for the promotion still earn the 5% interest from the uob one account?,btohqsg
WRT to UOB Xmas promo  I emptied my UOB One acct on 29 Sept. Didn't realise they credited interest on 30 Sept (it was only about $4). Does that mean that I needed to keep at least $100 004 in my account till earmarked?If my account had $100k exactly on 1 Jan day end  does that mean I violated the rules and am no longer eligible? CSO no idea  I just topped up $10 just in case.,btohqsg
Is everyone withdrawing the 4k today?,btohqsg
Hi all  now that hsbc Revo has been nerfed  wad alternative cards would be best to replace? Apart from Lady’s,btohqsg
Oh it doesn’t exclude hotel and airfare?,btohqsg
Ppv gives 4mpd for contactless payments. If online airfare  can consider dbs wmcc,btohqsg
UOB PPV works based on payment mode I think. (Online and contactless),btohqsg
Oh I was looking at the whitelist but it doesn’t include airfare & hotel. So jus wanted to double check,btohqsg
Only hotels and OTA nerfed  the card is still useful and plus there’s no AF. If you need a card for your hotel bookings  add WWMC in your wallet.,btohqsg
Did a video on this recentlyhttps://youtu.be/4wUmKuriG8M?si=omQU37JnBIqKhKWl,btohqsg
Rising Dragon promo  i made a mistake. I did step 2 first( transfer 100k in). Should I transfer out then do step 1 ( participate registration) then transfer fund in again?. Will it work?,btohqsg
If I purchase something using UOB One credit card on the 31st and the credit payment only confirmed today  will the spending be counted for this month or last month?,btohqsg
Sorry you’re rightI wasn’t aware there’s a MCC white list for online txn,btohqsg
I don't think it matters. As long by 30 Dec 10pm the account is empty,btohqsg
Based on the nerfed mcc  I can still get 4mpd for airfare booked directly with SQ/scoot?,btohqsg
Yes as long as not 4722 and 7011,btohqsg
Ok then not as bad as I thought haha,btohqsg
u registered in Dec? did u have $100k in by 30 Dec?,btohqsg

Anyone know if you can bypass the UOB$ merchant problem by using Amaze paired with UOB Lady solitaire?,btohqsg
Can workaround either pair with Amaze or use Kris+,btohqsg
hi all  i wanna open a joint account with my wife for shared stuff like groceries  etc. any good suggestions which bank & account i should open?,btohqsg
i dun think can withdraw cos haven even invested and no units to sell,btohqsg
Yes and yes. It was abt $102k on the 29/12.On 1/1 I decided to clean up a bit n just kept exactly 100k there. Then the interest occurred to me early this morning so I quickly topped up $10.But if they looked at 1/1 day end balance  it would seem I'm $4 short of the required amount.,btohqsg
should be fine since transactions on 1 Jan is dated 2 jan,btohqsg
then u need to keep a min balance of $200k in order to get the $588 bonus,btohqsg
he signed up for xmas promo and emptied on 30 Sep,btohqsg
For those going - MCC is 7399 (Amaze charges a fee for it 🥲),btohqsg
ah sorry i tot he is referring to the CNY Promo.... my bad!,btohqsg
I sure hope you're right  thanks 👍,btohqsg
I’d suggest dbs myaccount as well  which is what I personally use with my spouse. No need to think about maintaining a certain amt inside and potential fall below fee,btohqsg
just curious to ask.. when u guys deposit 100k to UOB for the Promo  what purpose code you use? Sala?,btohqsg
Ok my bad I assume you have 100k or so to put it in,btohqsg
Any code unless your salary does not go inside the account,btohqsg
Sorry I better not act smart though I don't see any issues since it is fresh funds,btohqsg
I would probably call them and ask but see if anyone here can help.,btohqsg
i use this when transferring from dbs,btohqsg
icic.. hope other gurus can enlighten also..,btohqsg
