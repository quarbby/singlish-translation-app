A guide to COE purchasing and COE renewal on your ownWhat are the essential facts you need to know  should you choose to purchase COE or carry out a COE renewal on your own? Here's a comprehensive step-by-step guide!➡️ Read itHERE!👉🏻 Here is how you can do it yourself,btohqsg
You guys shud do beta before roll out. 😂,btohqsg
IMO  quite a big change from the prev design. Idk for the better or worse but it took some getting used to. The search filters were definitely not as intuitive as the previous design but now ok liao.That said  I like that it also includes the # of owners from the preview instead of having to open up the link to see it.,btohqsg
We have to roll out then if can get ya'll feedbacks from there we can then see how we can improve from there  so won't have unbiased opinions haha,btohqsg
btw idk if this bug has been fixed but on the prev version  when you try to save a search  all the other params cant really be saved so like for example  I wanna save a search for 2.9a pdk with less than 3 owners  I will also be notified when cars that have more than 3 owners are listed.,btohqsg

The 1st one so easier to see.,btohqsg
2nd one better cus shows owner count,btohqsg
The new one don’t have this info. Need to calculate by urself remaining mths left,btohqsg
Oh yes dk why coe remaining got taken out,btohqsg
Admin  do 2nd one with coe remaining leh🤣,btohqsg
"First Image (96 000 km / 8 months left):Clarity: The use of clear  minimalistic icons (like the calendar) is visually pleasing and helps in quick recognition of key information.Highlighting Key Info: The ""8 months left"" text is circled in red  drawing immediate attention to the COE duration  which is an important piece of information for potential buyers.Layout: The spacing seems clean  and the most relevant details (price  mileage  COE duration) are presented in digestible chunks.Second Image (98 000 km / 2 Owners):Information Density: This layout packs more information (like the number of owners) but might feel slightly busier.Font Weight: The font used for some of the text is heavier (e.g.  “$72 000”) and might appear more imposing to some viewers.Price Highlight: The inclusion of the loan installment ($8 504/month) is beneficial for buyers concerned with financing but may also add to the clutter.Conclusion:The first design is likely more comfortable for the human eye due to its cleaner layout  clearer separation of details  and use of highlighting (red circle) to direct attention. However  both are effective  and which is better may depend on the user's focus (e.g.  overall info vs. specific highlights like the remaining COE).",btohqsg

not sure  i just see the workshop spray degreaser freely after doing work in engine bay  eg  after open brake lines all oily  they freely spray. after that everything is clean,btohqsg
