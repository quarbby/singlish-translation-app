If I pair UOB Krisflyer CC with its Krisflyer savings accounts  that should boost my miles further by a lot right,btohqsg
My exp here  cashback will be credited next day after giro payment (credit card) deducted.,btohqsg
Uob Krisflyer is only for OTA.,btohqsg
I mean what does OTA stands for?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúWhat OTA‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.,btohqsg
Can pay with kris + which is considered OTA right? Earning 4mpd++ the Krisflyer saving account bonus mpdThat should add up a lot no?,btohqsg
Hello! Just to check why shouldn‚Äôt use Kris+ to pay for travel agency package? :o it doesn‚Äôt retain the 4722 MCC or it‚Äôs an exclusion stated somewhere?,btohqsg
A reply not far above said kris+ is not 4722,btohqsg
Yea and this too because all Kris+ transactions are worth 3mpd right?,btohqsg
Ahhh but what if it‚Äôs KF UOB & Kris+ to pay for a package at travel agency? Should be ok I think? ü§î,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking too. Coupled with the Kris savings account.,btohqsg
Right‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll test it out if I can (my travel agency might apply for kris+ partner),btohqsg
How much money you keep in UOB KF account? There is a cap on max miles you can earn based on your saving in account.It is 5% of your MAB only.,btohqsg
Assuming we keep 100k in uob kris savings instead of one account.. the 5% cap should not be reachable right,btohqsg
Either way  we can always split our payments if it exceed the 5% MAB right,btohqsg
Personally i dont see how this will beat the uob one plus uob lady solitaire combo thou,btohqsg
It‚Äôs around 10mpd with salary creditingAccount = 6Card = 3Kris+ = 1,btohqsg
Hi guru  is it possible to change the OCBC 90N CC billing cycle?,btohqsg
Bonus miles cap at 60k per year  so  over 10k spending will break the cap,btohqsg
I just play ard uob website based on your 100k mab  no matter how i adjust cant go over 60k annual,btohqsg
Maybe is each month can earn max 60k based on 100k mab which is 2 month need to keep in for 20k spending spilt half,btohqsg
The screen shot above shows 63k bonus in a single month,btohqsg
That is based on 120k mab,btohqsg
Try to reply to the message so that the threads get continued for other to view with ease of reference,btohqsg
Oh ok I get what you mean,btohqsg
I believe $100k mab can earn max 5 000 miles per month.It means you are paying $416.67(UOB One acct opportunity cost) for 5 000 miles. That works out about 8.3 cents per mile.,btohqsg
The cheapest way to earn mile is still Lady 6mpd.,btohqsg
Haha  no wonder i think something is wrong coz i got count before that it is not worth. Coz i think now uob krisflyer acct got something like the rising dragon for new fund and i told my friend not worth it,btohqsg
Oh wow. Nice way of putting it across! Thanks! üôèSeems more like an option of choosing between cash interest or miles back. Ratios is kinda 1:1,btohqsg
Where got 1 to 1  i think the post mean u pay 8.3 cent per dollar so it is damn ex,btohqsg
SA does not accept paywave payments. I also used HSBC Adv  $2.8k pm,btohqsg
Hi all - any one tried and got feedback for tpg home broadband,btohqsg
Hi guys  any idea how to upload e-signature for my HSBC account? Tried to apply for giro for my IRAS tax but got rejected as I didn't have a signature with the bank,btohqsg
You need to go to the bank branch and register your signature.,btohqsg
Hi  u have to go down physically to any hsbc branch to do the signature.,btohqsg
"I spoke to the CSO they said can upload via ""supporting documents"" but I couldn't find it.",btohqsg
The CSO at the branch personally told me that I have to go down to the branch to do it lol,btohqsg
anyone knows if fwd is excluded from hsbc revolution miles?,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website can propose a list of best credit cards to use based on merchant or mcc code. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Not worth it for $100 n below anymore,btohqsg
For recurring payments- iPayMy : 1.85% + $1- Cardup : 1.85%Seems like might have to switch to Cardup soon.,btohqsg
Luckily I locked in 1.79% already.Time to jump,btohqsg
Even with 1.79%  the breakeven is only if you charge more than $1666.67.,btohqsg
Need some opinions. Planning a holiday in june and will be have 4.5k on flights but my main cards are citi rewards/hsbc rev are fully utilised.,btohqsg
I have wwmc / SIA Amex / citi PM,btohqsg
Should i apply SC journey just to get bonus miles?,btohqsg
All the mighty mind here. I saw somewhere  Dbs world women miles count for Singtel recursive bills  anyone can confirm?,btohqsg
Pay via singtel onepass web does count for 4mpd,btohqsg
Earmark release for christmas promo for oct registration,btohqsg
Good morning  I would like to invest in the S&P500 but don't know how. Can anyone guide me?,btohqsg
I assume u are buying BTO and not alrdy bought.1. Take hdb loan for now. Can always go to bank loan if interest rates goes below 2.6%. Note that once u go bank loan  u cant go back to hdb loan.2. Depends on your financial goals  how much cash u have and age. If below 40  why keep so much cpf is OA and dont use. If possible use ur OA but leave 20k in there.3. Again  this is personal choice  no right or wrong  depends on your financial planning/goal and how much u earn and how much cash u have. If u have a long run way  i personally feel 15 to 25yrs is a good tenure. If u take hdb loan u can pay off early down the road,btohqsg
You can watch this video by Chris:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/170184,btohqsg
Anyone has 2 same grab rides charged twice and a different price ? The amt charged to my grab apps is 14.80 and not 28.70. Uob said the actual amt is 14.80 and 28.70 is the estimated amount and this will be reversed out from the their system?,btohqsg
1. At the current interest climate go HDB first and wait out. The benefit is also non-monetary. With hdb  loan is not disbursed until u collect keys. Bank loans are disbursed immediately so payments start.2. Think leave 20k if u are able to.3. Max out.. to lower the monthly instalment. That‚Äôs if you don‚Äôt plan to stay in that hdb forever and will sell.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs normal if you take metered taxi. The actual value will be posted and the initial estimate will disappear after some time. So no reason to worry,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know that using grab apps has metered rides,btohqsg
Just thought is odd.. cos I always choose fixed charge,btohqsg
No point to panic since it‚Äôs still pending (not posted),btohqsg
:) not panic. Am just very curious how this works. Thanks.,btohqsg
UserStellahas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no Huat pals,btohqsg
Sorry  I‚Äôm new to this‚Ä¶ just to check and clarify for point 3:Max out the loan tenure  won‚Äôt the interest that needs to be paid be more as compared to say 10 years loan or 20 years loan?,btohqsg
Ya  but if u going to sell say after MOP then max out can save cash,btohqsg
Kind of like using the bank‚Äôs money to make money from capital appreciation?,btohqsg
3. leverage is how people use property to get rich faster. you use less capital outlay to earn outsized returns based on ppty valuation.anw loan interest rates are higher than OA's 2.5% interest income rate. but there were 2 decades before covid where bank loan rates were consistently lower than OA's 2.5% earn rate  allowing people who used bank loan to arbitrage and make CPF earn that extra interest income (vs if one were to use OA to paydown in advance and then have accrue interest at 2.5% on said sum),btohqsg
bank loan also disbursed when collect key,btohqsg

UOB Christmas Earmark has been released for those in the first batch!However you will NOT be able to participate in the current Rising Dragon.Do be prepared for the next UOB promo  likely starts in April 2024.,btohqsg
Not exactly lah lol.if got extra money to rotate between stash and uob one haha,btohqsg
Stash has lower interest. Is it still worth to participate?,btohqsg
Has anyone's UOB cny funds has been earmarked? Or not yet,btohqsg
3 plus ard 1.7 if earmark  not a bad choice for total ard 4.7. Just dont touch for the whole period and do one time full withdraw and let it rest for one month to reset to zero. 3 is based on 100k mab and no withdrawal,btohqsg
Earmarked 2 days ago  registered in Jan,btohqsg
Calculated. In this interest dropping environment. It‚Äôs still worth it. Due to the extra $558 and short lock in period.,btohqsg

i am of the opinion stash + promo is not worth it.I rather only do UOB One + promo (which means can only participate twice a year)  but you rotate 2 humans.Quarter 1 = Human A with UOB One + earmarkQuarter 2 = Human B with UOB One + earmarkQuarter 3 = Human A with UOB One + earmarkQuarter 4 = Human B with UOB One + earmarkof course when a Human has no earmark  that human is still earning 5% p.a. on UOB One. Just no earmark extra cash reward.,btohqsg
yes rising dragon (first batch) all earmarked already.. many shouted here.,btohqsg
Only work if u got 2 human mah  cant expect everyone can control 2 human bank acct plus fulfill criteria,btohqsg
yeah also true... just sharing if can control multiple humans  what is the optimal (in my opinion) strategy loh..if only one human  i guess stash also ok  but i don't like the mechanics of stash (must increase ADB) style.. easy to mess up.,btohqsg
Depend on amt too  like if got 200k can do your way. Got 400k  or more different strategy. Too many financial intitution wanting fresh fund liao due to high interest environment so throw out alot of different promo,btohqsg

All these abt UOB dragon promotion  suppose if emptied out 100K on Dec 30  does it affect the Dec ONE bonus interest payout in Jan ?,btohqsg
SCB E saver credits interest on monthly basis? Eg early of the mth for previous mth?,btohqsg
It doesn‚Äôt  if you manage to plan it so that your average balance for Dec is still above 100k,btohqsg

hello  can check if citi premier miles can still be used for payment of hospital bills?,btohqsg
Yes. Your ADB will drop so the interest will be affected. You can compensate by putting extra from 1 -29 dec.,btohqsg

Hi gurus  is a recurring bill to singtel eligible for 4mpd on DBs wmcc?,btohqsg
Can someone enlighten me what is this?,btohqsg
Just use excel to calculate the average yourself. If you‚Äôre at 100k for 30 days and then the last day is 0  the average for the whole month won‚Äôt be 100k. Basic math,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it stated in the email,btohqsg
Based on your posting  you maintain $100k from 01-29 Dec and withdraw it on 30 Dec. Hence  it is not throughout.It means you only maintain $100k on 29 days out of 31 days in December.ADB = (29 days x $100k)/31days.,btohqsg
Hi I need some advice from veterans here. I have a fraud transaction back in 2021  till now still unresolved. The amt is 6.5k. Uob offered 50% goodwill offer  or let me choose to go fidrec for mediation. (if I go mediation  50% offer will be invalid) So I went for mediation. after mediation  the conclusion was no one is allegedly guilty  back in 2021.To cut story short  back to 2023  the amt 6.5k still exist in my cc bill  but late charge was waived from then till Oct 2023  where uob started charging interest of around 180+- per month. Called in cso many times  went their different oub branch 3 times  in January  and now still waiting their reply. But interest charged keep piling up  now reach abt $880.Any experts can pls advise on what to do next?I have been their long time account holder  >10 to 15yrs and even taking home loan with them.I went to uob Plaza  hoping to meet higher management  but the cso who served me only helped to call the hotline  and informed no need to meet.Appreciate if u have any advice pls.,btohqsg
Maybe write in to mas to seek help,btohqsg
can you give more background on the Fraud transaction.MerchantOnline/OfflineAny OTP involved,btohqsg
My cc was charged by someone's bigpay account  for ecommerce in Malaysia. I didn't even know what was bigpay then and didn't own any bigpay account.Police final verdict is that it was out of their jurisdiction since it was overseas transaction.There were more than 10 transactions involving otp  but I did not receive any single otp at all. But m1 told me their system showed otps were sent to me. Likewise uob also said their system showed otp send to me. But I had none of them,btohqsg
ok are you using Android phone and did you install any 3rd party apps in your phone?I am not trying to grill you.I am just trying to guide you on why UOB seems to be washing their hands off you,btohqsg
because long story short  if there are OTPs involved  and it is proven that OTPs were indeed sent out  Banks have a stronger position to deny a fraud transaction waiver.,btohqsg
I remembered I was exercising in a park on the night the fraud happened. I only found out when I logged in the next morning.,btohqsg
yeah was your phone compromised due to your own actions?e.g. you installed some 3rd party software,btohqsg
As far as I remember  I only install app fr playstore.,btohqsg
because your situation has been 'reported in newspaper' before.If OTPs are involved  but the scammers are able to get the genuine OTP from the victims phone (due to 3rd party software  screensharing  ownself give up details to scammer)  then banks will be less/not liable.,btohqsg
There was 1.5k involved in transferwise  but managed to be reversed,btohqsg
Otherwise it wd be 8k fraud,btohqsg
Did you make a police report? So they can get telco involved on what happened to the SMS OTP?e.g. was the SMS diverted etc..,btohqsg
All was done in 2021. M1 said it was sent to my hp. But I did not receive any,btohqsg
So I went for mediation. after mediation  the conclusion was no one is allegedly guilty  back in 2021.What does this mean... did FIDREC assess you to be 50% liable?,btohqsg
there should have been a conclusion after the mediation.. who responsible for how much,btohqsg
and if FIDREC passed a judgement/recommendation  UOB would surely have followed it,btohqsg
Hi  both dbs altitude and dbs wwmc rejected my annual fee waiver despite heavy usage on them. if i cancel both cards  are there any penalties? what about the dbs ppints that i accumulated that shows in dbs paylah rewards?,btohqsg
"""But m1 told me their system showed otps were sent to me. Likewise uob also said their system showed otp send to me.""unfortunately this is the damning evidence..i think with these 2 pieces of info (M1 is objective  no reason to lie)  UOB offer you 50% discount is actually not bad already.It is probably caused by your phone being compromised  based on the limited information that you had provided.",btohqsg
On a side note  this is a good lesson for people not to install any apps outside of official app stores.  If you suspect your phone is compromised  reset the phone.,btohqsg
yeah i believe Phil Lee is definitely not a willing party to the scambut it is very likely a case he didn't know his phone was compromised.and if UOB got the evidence from M1 (independent party) that OTPs were indeed sent to Users mobile phone  then UOB actually can demand user to be 100% responsible for the charges.,btohqsg
Points will be forfeited if card cancelled before redemption. Call in and request (a few times via human assistance) before finally giving up.,btohqsg
i would suggest 28th march 2024,btohqsg
The Body Shop's Singapore stores will remain open despite its British business entering administration  said a company spokeswoman.https://str.sg/ukef,btohqsg
Sat is working day right for 30 mar,btohqsg
i won't risk it since you cannot predict which day UOB sets as the reference date..and no downside to do early  as long as you move in more funds on 1st march  you can also take out the funds earlier.,btohqsg
Withdraw on 30th should be standard based on past campaign. U have joined quite alot liao right  have u seen reference date before 30?,btohqsg
then later.. sway sway 30th march.. your other bank got maintenance.. u GGi always like to do at least 1-2 days earlier than the expected day..don't like JUST IN TIME,btohqsg
Hello  I'm new here. I would like to know that I now have an ocbc360 account. Is there any bank account with high fixed deposit interest recommended for another 100k?,btohqsg
i have heard of people see 30th as cutoff date  they go and do 30th 10.30pm and miss it...so...,btohqsg
I do at 30th midnight right after 29 usually. Anyway if move out 29 jan should also show as 30 since it is a public holiday,btohqsg
one thing i always am cautious about  is the bermuda triangle timing..i won't do banking stuff from 11pm to 6am... that is usually when banks do system maintenance / batch run.. and weird things can happen.,btohqsg
1). Do you have a lot of miles in these two cards?2). Did you use the 2 lounge passes?3). Heavy usage means how many digits of expenses/transactions in a year?4). Did you settled all the bills before due date?,btohqsg
and as said... if do on 28th march  no downside..yes maybe you need $115k for 27 days instead of $110k for 29 days...but your $115k can be taken out earlier and put into your other high interest earning account.. so it evens out..but u have big peace of mind 100% confirm qualify,btohqsg
Lol problem is what if dont have extra 15k coz i am counting i might not have that 15k if 27 day. Coz my money in and out for giro bill alot each month,btohqsg
then i guess no choice you won't get full 5% p.a. on $100k ADB for the month loh..for the user to weigh peace of mind more important or the full 5% p.a. on $100kno right no wrong,btohqsg
On a positive news  based on today's transactions  I have just noticed UOB Credit Cards seem to have switched to TMRW App authentication for online purchases. No more OTP authentication.What have you guys experienced?,btohqsg
Don't have to increase  can just maintain,btohqsg
Then try $106 897.00 in Mar n withdraw on 30 Mar  10am.,btohqsg
I have fraud transaction for citibank reward even though need to authorise through the app have call in to inform and dispute the charge,btohqsg
I had fraud on my Citi Premiermiles even though it was locked,btohqsg
this one confirm can reverse.. if Citi refuses  confirm can get FIDREC positive judgement in your favour!! lol,btohqsg
Fraud reversed  CCY conversion fee not ($0.07),btohqsg
there are merchants who do not turn on OTP verification.. so for those  the transaction will go through  but almost 100% banks will reverse for you if you call in to disputee.g. those USD10 ChatGPT nonsense,btohqsg
How does that work? If it‚Äôs locked the transaction will not be posted successfully I thought?,btohqsg
i have heard of this pecularity before.. lol.. not sure how it pans out,btohqsg
guys how to see mcc code on bank statement,btohqsg
Not activated also can have fraud.,btohqsg
bank statement don't have such info,btohqsg
Not applied also can have fraud.Kidding üòÇ,btohqsg
best way is to use Amaze card... MCC is shown in Amaze app.the other way is DBS Digibot.last way is to call into the bank and ask the officer (troublesome),btohqsg
and of course you can check HEYMAX (app/platform)this is crowdsourced / data sourced  but not 100% accurate,btohqsg
need to sign up then cn use?,btohqsg
yes Visa API can be accurate..BUT the search for the merchant may not be 100% accurate.For example if you go to a restaurant with a signboard Chris Dining  and you search Chris Dining in Heymax... you may end up with a result Chris Dining is 5812.. but if the restaurant happens to use their other payment terminal Chris Trading Pte Ltd  it could end up MCC 5399.,btohqsg
do yall know ifcrypto.comtop up is under which mcc,btohqsg
i dk how navigate the website LOL,btohqsg
I havent but im going to call and ask why. I spend almost 10k on both cards. not sure why reject.,btohqsg
1. yes. total accumulate 26k dbs points.2. yes  last year3. ard 10k ish alrd.4. always on time.,btohqsg
not sure if thats nt enuff to ask for a waiver...,btohqsg
Just do 31 (number of cal days) x $100k (targeted ADB) / 29 (number of days to keep in account before emptying),btohqsg
I would think 26k points is your weakness. Bank knows you have points with them n likely you will pay the AF.,btohqsg

What‚Äôs the hack that previously we can do?,btohqsg
brb time to top up my SA,btohqsg
if SA close at 55... then employment CPF contribution will all go RA?,btohqsg
A little before 55  move SA funds out to short term investment so will move OA funds first before SA funds (higher interest),btohqsg
Likely will be capped at chosen retirement sum  the remainder flow to OA,btohqsg
siao liaozz... unless they up the OA int rate,btohqsg
i think you can move your funds from OA to RA manually. he did mention it,btohqsg
I doubt so. OA rates always linked to HDB loan rates.,btohqsg
up this also means HDB loan rate up wor,btohqsg
crap laizo.. remaining SA trsf bk to OA.... means downgrade the interest rate,btohqsg
cannot transfer from OA to RA? i thought can what. why siao liao,btohqsg
cannot earn risk free 4% for money beyond ERS liao,btohqsg
"ERS is enhanced to 4X leh. any more than ERS  i think the govt say ""you're rich enough to help yourself"" hahaha",btohqsg
Can withdraw money from RA anytime or is it locked?,btohqsg
Does it mean OA to SA transfer can now be reversed at 55?,btohqsg
Say here first ah  singlife hack to get the money out of lifesg account,btohqsg

hi all  would it be better to earn miles from booking flights on Singapore Airlines website directly or 3rd party agent like agoda/expedia?,btohqsg
Put in money into moomoo 5.8% but recieve 4.6% ü•≤ anyone else have same issue,btohqsg
but i think amounts above FRS  that you have kept in RA  can be withdrawn anytime...so  while SA shielding is now dead  you still have an ATM facility up to $426k  just that CPF balances above $426k will either have to stay in OA at 2.5% p.a. or withdrawn as cash and you manage yourself.,btohqsg
If I don't use miles card  UOB one card should be quite safe to get reward right,btohqsg
i don't use UOB One and isn't familiar with the T&Cs,btohqsg
Really don't want to manage yourself at 65-70yrs old,btohqsg
i thought RA is for CPF Life only,btohqsg
Work backwards to see if the miles are good with the cost. Personally I always do booking directly with airline in the event something occurs (I heard of nightmare stories where changes for booking via a 3rd party agent must be made via the 3rd party  assuming they do entertain u),btohqsg
Quite a number of similar complaints on this moomoo 5.8%. You can search chat history using ‚Äúcash coupon‚Äù.,btohqsg
OA to RA can... but no more SA means u can't sheild yr excess SA funds to earn at fixed rate of 4% yet still have the liquidity to withdraw....,btohqsg
Yea i just did but seems like no one actually got paid the right amount yet.,btohqsg
BREAKING: Changes to CPF system for Budget 2024Source:https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/singapore-budget-2024-lawrence-wong-live-blog-4122681?fbclid=IwAR1_ZtbmdDJZ5R6UHMgVZjF2WHiPp-xrH2I_R-zE7KJWVAMHMGuK8LgnSH0üëâ Discuss more athttps://t.me/honeymoneysgüëâ More referral athttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
oh yes  no more free ATM at 4% interest rate. but you can still participate in CPF Life if you use  i guess the purpose is really to close the loophole that made it to national papers hahaha,btohqsg
the interest rate is not downgraded for govt supported scheme (aka CPF Life). But for the hack  for sure its downgraded because its not meant to be so,btohqsg
Those who did not check means probably they are giving moomoo free lunch. Those who check n found abnormal will complain.,btohqsg
but is silly since instead of providing more viable options to safely grow retirement funds saving  they practically juz close off options,btohqsg
How long will it take for the points to be granted after buying an air tickets using dbs cards? immediately or after the air ticket used up? sayi bought in jan 25  when will the point reflected in my rewards?,btohqsg
its not silly  the proper way (via CPF Life) is still well alive,btohqsg
i think the perspective should be calibrated. we should acknowledge that its a hack  and that its a privilege not an entitlement. Thus  its not a downgrade  but a closure of loophole with proper channels still available.,btohqsg
its called a hack for a reason  it was never meant to be this way. they are just finding the correct solution to bring it back. they did it  and still provide extra x1 brs for the 4%,btohqsg
My understanding on this is only those OA+SA more than S$426k will be impacted by this no shielding. Those OA+SA less than $426k can transfer from OA to RA to earn 4%.Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
yes. but some people are complaining bc they wanna earn the 4% but don't wanna participate via CPF Life (but cash withdrawal instead). that's a hack and its closed,btohqsg
I don't think so. Should be any contributions after FRS on RA will continue to contribute to max RA for CPF Life. The rest move to OA can withdraw as per norm  if hit FRS on RA.,btohqsg
Cpf board next few weeks sure kana bombarded,btohqsg
because it is RETROSPECTIVELY APPLIED..Those who yaya very happy already SA shielded  WILL NOW HAVE THEIR SA CLOSED,btohqsg
we can wait for further details but my belief is any amounts above FRS in your RA (that is not from topping up) can be withdrawn ANYTIME in cash,btohqsg
RA is meant to be for CPF Life  that's my understanding. even before today's closure of the hack,btohqsg
yes RA will be used for CPF Life if you leave it there when you START CPF Life.. but you can withdraw from RA  amounts above FRS  anytime.,btohqsg
Very unlikely.‚ÄúAs a principle  only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the long-term interest rate  and savings that can be withdrawn on demand should earn the short-term interest rate ‚Äù the Ministry of Finance said.,btohqsg
yeah they are raising ERS to be 4 x BRS soon,btohqsg
"its for ""payouts in retirements"". Its not for lump sum (aka ATM function)",btohqsg
of course i could be wrong... have to wait for official details  but based on current wordings  the part about amounts above FRS can be withdrawn has not changed.,btohqsg
I think the government will not allow anything above FRS to be withdrawn from RA. This fulfills their aim to help only those who need to reach the frs and not to be an ATM function.,btohqsg
withdrawal of amounts above FRS is referring to OA + SA at 55yr old  not RA,btohqsg
I believe the key is to withdraw from your RA BEFORE your CPF Life starts at 65,btohqsg
isn't that even lower than FRS? (which means MORE can be withdrawn),btohqsg
property pledging from FRS to BRS is always there,btohqsg
yes yes... it is saying if you pledge property you can drawdown to BRS..if you don't pledge property  you can drawdown to FRS,btohqsg
drawdown from OA+SA excess. not when we voluntarily top up above FRS in RA.... RA is for CPF Life payouts. no? hahaha,btohqsg
wait ah.. i answered Xris on this.. forgot which chat liaohttps://t.me/financecafesg/155235,btohqsg
i think i know what you mean. if true  still got a long way for me to said age hahaha.,btohqsg
let's wait for details loh.. i am also best guessing onlyBUT think about it.. if ONE WAY street topup RA cannot withdraw  which sane person would topup,btohqsg
got.... many people don't wanna manage investments (at young or old age),btohqsg
Do you have any DBS/POSB savings account currently? Or have you updated your income?,btohqsg
But you get higher monthly payout for life.According to the Ministry of Finance  a CPF member with three times the Basic Retirement Sum in 2025 can have an estimated monthly payout of S$2 530 (US$1 880).By comparison  a member with four times the BRS next year - or S$426 000 - can receive an estimated monthly payout of S$3 330.,btohqsg
Employees after 55yo only contribute to MA and OA,btohqsg
Means your CPF contributions last year have hit the annual limit.,btohqsg
i think most people (especially those in finance chats and learning over the years) can do better than CPF Life return rates.,btohqsg
Basically your financial dept screws up.. they didn't keep track of cpf payment,btohqsg
or u have more than 1 job / cpf contribution source... or you go and voluntary contribute?,btohqsg
Playstore also will have malware one,btohqsg
the refund is due to excess mand contr  vol has another cap i think,btohqsg
during 2023 the CPF mand contri increased from $6K upwards. likely HR compute wrongly and gave you AW CPF based on 6K*12 months and so it exceeded the annual mandatory CPF cap,btohqsg
"Yes  but I still have alot of ""older"" friends who are too ""lazy"" to invest.  So this will be good for those people. Or for those who really got alot of spare money outside of CPF  then CPF money is nothing to them and they may choose to do this",btohqsg
SA savings will be transferred to the RA up to the Full Retirement Sum  and continue to attract the same long-term interest rate.DPM Wong said the remaining SA savings will be transferred to the OA  but members can voluntarily transfer their OA savings to the RA at any time to earn higher interest and receive higher retirement payouts.Otherwise  members may choose to keep those savings in the OA  where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate.The long-term interest rate  which applies to the SA  RA and MA  is currently set at a minimum of 4 per cent  while the short-term interest rate applying to the OA is currently held at a 2.5 per cent minimum.‚ÄúAs a principle  only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the long-term interest rate  and savings that can be withdrawn on demand should earn the short-term interest rate ‚Äù MOF said in its statement.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/budget-2024-higher-cpf-retirement-sum-ceiling-from-2025-among-slew-of-changes?utm_medium=social&utm_source=telegram&utm_campaign=sttgOK I could be wrong after reading this...,btohqsg
The maximum cpf you+ your employer supposed to contribute is $37 740. However  your payroll personnel calculated wrongly and contributed more than $37 740.This happen if you earn more than $102 000 annually.,btohqsg
the principle makes sense though. otherwise how to give long term interest income to short term liquidity,btohqsg
MOF telling you... YOU WANT 4%  YOU MUST LOCK IN!,btohqsg
Free lunch is over. Now is reality. Want more? Then lock in,btohqsg
The changes in CPF is to benefit for the majority of the people who use CPF as it is without hacks.  For the rest of us  we just have to figure out again on how to maximize the benefits under the new system.,btohqsg
Hais MRSS top up to parent no longer attract tax relief too‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
well said. like if UOB closes the salary hack  we just gotta accept it  because it is a hack to start with.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGso now top up SA to reach FRS as early as possible or top up MA first?,btohqsg
make hay when sun shines... sun set then accept it...,btohqsg
"As the phase ""7 years of bountiful harvest and 7 years of famine"". Be ready to adapt and thankful we have room to maneuver while other countries are going into recession.",btohqsg
I confused.. so we still can top up now?,btohqsg
why don't top up thou  you hit FRS earlier  you still can take out at 55 mah. you still have 4% SA,btohqsg
ya no shielding but u still can earn 4% in your early years,btohqsg
No more SA shielding but top up to SA now still enjoys tax relief and 4% compounding until 55yo,btohqsg
I wonder those shielded and above 55  all closed SA and go to OA too?,btohqsg
What's the confusion? Lol. Nothings changed before 55.,btohqsg
I did SA shielding 3 months ago & managed to set aside 293k. Now  Dy PM announced to close SA for those above 55. No more 4% risk free interest for me.,btohqsg
still got 10 months free lunch la,btohqsg
Compounding take place best with time to let it compound   now SA will close at 55 years old the run way is very much shorter.,btohqsg
Govt urging u to let it continue compounding in RA üåö,btohqsg
You still can save to ERS at $426k but cannot withdraw. That sum  in the government‚Äôs eye  is more than enough for retirement. Not to make extra money from cpf ‚Ä¶ üòÖ,btohqsg
RA i dont really like cuz cannot withdraw as and when .. lol .. i guess cannot have your cake and eat it ..,btohqsg
now this is a bad idea if it can only lead to CPF Life.,btohqsg
Top up SA or MA? I am below 55 but next month OA will be wipe off cos I need to buy house,btohqsg
Hi all can i check if citi rewards plus amaze can pay for season parking and town council?and how to go about it to enjoy the miles,btohqsg
So when u sell your financial product after 55  the money goes to RA or OA?,btohqsg
I think if U have hit FRS. It will go to OA,btohqsg
I thought can withdraw as long u have BRS inside (with housing pledge) until age 65 before CPF Life starts,btohqsg
Hi guys  did anybody successfully top up snack using Amex TCB or UOB Absolute Amex? Not sure why mine kept encountering error,btohqsg
Means if have not hit FRS  it will go to RA?,btohqsg
I thought so too ORIGINALLY  but now i think they are making it rigid.Principle being..you want 4%  must be locked inyou want withdraw anymore  only give you 2.5%,btohqsg
Frankly for those who aren‚Äôt aware of shielding and do not have ers amount in SA  there‚Äôs really no change as SA balance will be emptied to RA at 55,btohqsg
Now it‚Äôs going to be tough to hit ers amount,btohqsg
The summary really is only 2.5% account is ATM-like withdrawable4% is only for retirement lock upWhich frankly makes sense as a gov system pov,btohqsg
RA can be increased only at its formation during 55 year old and then manual transfers/top up later.Assuming you‚Äôve invested using SA to begin with. If invested with OA then it will go back to OA as per old rules,btohqsg
Other than shielding idk many people who invests with SA,btohqsg
ya la.. this is actually morally / financially correct.the shielding is all along a hack and we really should not be too upset it has been patched,btohqsg
For those who were planning to use SA as a HYSA  depending on when you‚Äôll hit 55  if there‚Äôs a high interest environment like we had the past 18mo  then it doesn‚Äôt make any difference  just withdraw and put in banks.It‚Äôll be an issue if at that time  only equities offer above 4%,btohqsg
Anyway probably those in their early 50s/late 40s should be concerned? Younger folks relax  so much time left the rules can‚Äôt stay the same that long,btohqsg
I fall under the 49 cohort and this changes a lot of cash flow plans haha.  But not really catastrophic  it‚Äôs not like they increased mandatory lock up of funds.We still can wdraw excess of frs  just need to find >4% liquid instrument by the time we hit 55,btohqsg
Yeah  for younger folks  who knows  cpf might change again favouring shielding like mechanism in the future.Just plan for several scenarios and move on.  Kinda waste of time worrying about things we can‚Äôt directly control,btohqsg
Hi  can i check..if im above age 55 but still working  the SA still close? So contributions all go into OA and MA?,btohqsg
CPF video say liao..go into RA first.. RA hit FRS liao.. then OA.https://youtu.be/bAXSvLAOXnI,btohqsg
Thanks for the vidYup for those who‚Äôve met FRS already you actually have more flexibility with your OA esp if you still have a sizable mortgage,btohqsg
My mum is above 55 and still working. It goes to OA SA MA. Not RA‚Ä¶,btohqsg
The change won‚Äôt occur till next year.,btohqsg
Cpf SA shielding Nerfed by govt,btohqsg
maybe will change bah (as implied by CPF video),btohqsg
If your mom already hit frs already then next year her cpf will be split to Ma and oa only just like anyone already hit frs under 55 now,btohqsg
"seems the RA will be the ""new SA"" for those after 55",btohqsg
Why not start put in next month instead of this month  so the waiting time is shorter  correct?,btohqsg
As in notification? Or still use app but to get otpI've gotten notifications but everytime I click in nothing happens on the app and I end up opening the app otp to key in,btohqsg
So if hit FRS  the SA / RA allocation will flow to OA?,btohqsg
As per the YouTube video üòÇ,btohqsg
Good question. I want to know also. I supposed if you have hit FRS in RA for by 55  then your CPF monthly contributions will go into OA and MA not RA and MA. Then it's up to you if you want to transfer money from OA to RA,btohqsg
If you can put into other investments that gives you >2.5% then don‚Äôt have to transfer into RAYou can withdraw from OA and put into other investments that yields 3-5%,btohqsg
Does it means that no more shielding ?,btohqsg
Basically what was discussed just earlier.,btohqsg

Depends items in your ocbc 360,btohqsg
Yes but you need to fulfill the uob one  criteria for getting high interest. And you need to consider when and how much to take out the excess amount from ocbc 360 to minimise the loss from opportunity costs (your ocbc 360 bonus interest for save criteria),btohqsg
For those who want to pledge their property and opt for BRS instead of FRS  does it mean that they will be withdrawing from RA?,btohqsg

Do you know if I book a hotel using atome  will it be under atome mcc 5999 or travel mcc?,btohqsg
Probably not forcibly liquidated  but then you do liquidate (whether by choice or by natural timing)  the monies will go to RA if you haven‚Äôt fulfilled FRS  to be consistent with how they would have been if they weren‚Äôt invested,btohqsg

Auction: You pay $98.24 per unitNow: You sell at $98.31 per unit  you made only $0.07 per unit = 0.07% in 15 days = 1.7% p.a.And that's even assuming you can sell exactly at $98.31  without any fees/spread/slippage,btohqsg
Oops... Sorry I was confused. The face value is $100Upon maturity  I will receive $100/unit  hence it only makes sense to sell if the price goes above $100.Thanks  this is my first TBills.,btohqsg
There is no interest received upfront for Tbills. Wrong concept.You merely bought a Tbills at a discount from 100.So in your case. You paid $98.24.,btohqsg
Oops... Sorry I was confused. The face value is $100Upon maturity  I will receive $100/unit  hence it only makes sense to sell if the price goes above $100.Thanks  this is my first TBills.,btohqsg
it will never be above $100 lol,btohqsg

Assuming a CPF member can do own investment using CPF money n can achieve return more than 6% per year  if the member prefers to keep minimum CPF in RA  ie BRS  what shall the member needs to do now on the extra CPF money in OA n SA before reaching 55 to avoid the money to be locked in RA to meet FRS?,btohqsg

Cuz UOB need to enrol frequent flyer conversion. I go redeem already then sign up for the frequent flyer,btohqsg
Ok somebody asked this about SA investments too.I‚Äôm not sure of the answer but I doubt it will be auto ‚Äúlocked‚Äù into RA.My guess is you will be given one chance to either route it into locked RA or into 2.5% OA.,btohqsg

Hi all i have some very important questions hope someone has the answer.1) Once i reach 55 and chose FRS  the 4% earn in my RA will be kept in my RA or put in CPF common pool?2) Once i reach 65  and i chose FRS at 55  can i upgrade to ERS or downgrade to BRS?3) If i upgrade to ERS at 65  the amount i need to top up will be the prevailing sum at that point of time when i was 65 or the ERS when i was at 55 back then?4) I understand the interest earn from cpf life will go into common pool. if i chose ERS and set aside 419k at 55 in RA  the amount will become 586k when i reach 65. if i die at 65 before i started collected my cpf life  will my beneficiary get 586k or 419k?5) If i continue to work beyond 55  my cpf contribution will all go to OA since there is no more SA?These are some burning questions hope someone can help to answer. Thank you.,btohqsg
UserEDhas 2/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no shopee links,btohqsg
I think the new rules is after 55 SA+OA FRS will go to RA ( the rest above for SA will go to OA),btohqsg
1. Once you hit 55  RA will be formed using your SA (first) and OA monies  until FRS. For now (till the CPF changes take effect)  you can withdraw any amounts from OA/SA after RA is reached FRS. You can withdraw amounts in RA (less top-ups to SA/RA  interest earned in RA) till BRS if you decide to pledge your HDB  else your RA will be purely used for CPF life from 65. Scroll and up read on previous conversations on what will happen after CPF changes take effect. Interests earned in the respective accounts will always be deposited into the respective accounts (i.e. interest earned in CPF LIFE premiums will deposited to your CPF LIFE premiums at the floor rate of 4% once you start the CPF LIFE payouts).2. After 55  you can top-up RA to hit ERS. But once you top-up RA  you cannot reverse it. Withdrawal to BRS as stated in point 1.3. ERS will be 3x (4x after CPF changes) of your BRS. Withdrawal to BRS as stated in point 1.4. You can read about nomination of CPF on how the monies are distributed to your nominees here:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/account-services/providing-for-your-loved-ones/making-a-cpf-nomination5. Once the CPF changes take effect  your contributions will be split amongst OA  RA and MA.,btohqsg
1) I hear from my colleagues said ( he 60) 4% will go to RA   till 65 or you redraw month payment (70 you must redraw) .Than the 4% will go to the pool,btohqsg
$500 spend for UOB One bonus interest  yes. $500 minimum spending for UOB One card  no.,btohqsg
I would suggest to change UOB lady category to travel. For your other spends use UOB PPV and UOB visa signature. These give you 4 mpd up to $3K. Then use Citi rewards w Amaze for another $1k earn 4 mpd,btohqsg
5) will go OA if you hit FRS    if not goto RA . I think this is the new change.Not very sure,btohqsg
üëç true yeah this way cut down on my dbs bah üòÇ the 6x points also end on March  I swop now to travel also same üòÖüòÖ 4x. Hopefully will extend again üòÜ,btohqsg
For the funds earmarked in the uob rising dragon promo   this is my current balance above . Not sure why my  available balance is 670.35. Means I can still spend anything within this 670.35?,btohqsg
Because the cash credit of 588 has been credited.,btohqsg
Yes correct sawed it  but how do I know how much of $ can use from the uob 1 debit card ? As have insurance payments to make,btohqsg
Hi which credit card (master/Vis) can earn point / rebate for education payment?,btohqsg
Yes  if didn't hit FRS  u only can draw 5k one time out. Rest of oa and SA go into Ra.Problem is for those already hit FRS  SA cannot continue earn 4% interests after 55. All go to OA which earn 2.5%,btohqsg
Can transfer to RA if still want to get the 4%,btohqsg
But u don't have flexibility anymore to withdraw anytime,btohqsg
Ya   GOV support the low income.Not the mid income.In this way don't need to increase personal income tax,btohqsg

You can refer to the excerpt from the TNC here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163442,btohqsg
This is under the situation after 2025 when no more SA acc right?my guess is that it should go to OA. Cos FRS is not mandatory. Just that upon 55 yrs old  if u have enough from SA and OA combined to hit FRS.The system will take and put into RA. But in this case whether for SA investment or OA used for housing and after sales  the amount should go to OA sunce SA no moreIf u want more cpf life payout then u do the top up from OA to RA ( its also to entice you since OA only 2.5%,btohqsg
But the CPF video also said if u still working after 55 and frs not hit  your work CPF goes to RA first before OA.,btohqsg
Sounds like a sneaky / forceful way to try to get everyone to be near FRS before u can touch your CPF.,btohqsg
Might be due to Mandatory contribution as now its still goes to SA. But since it no SA  it goes to RA (same int acc),btohqsg
Ok we can wait for more details to be announced but the CPF video shared was very clear.,btohqsg

Dbs/posb counts for my posb cashback Salary criteria,btohqsg
Yes that is correct. Meaning to say that your original OA SA MA allotment  once the SA is closed  your originally SA allotted monies will go into RA to meet your cohort FRS (if there is a shortfall). Otherwise  it will go into your OA.,btohqsg
This one not so worrying yet.The big one which I‚Äôm sure many are waiting for confirmation is:What happens to investments bought with SA when u pass 55 years old.,btohqsg
From my understanding from theFAQ  the current allocation will still be in effect  just that it will be allocated to MA  RA  OA instead MA  SA  OA.The contributions that would be affected would be the increase of 1.5% contribution for ages 55 to 65  whereby if you haven't hit FRS in RA  the full 1.5% will be allocated to RA  but once hit FRA in RA it will be allocated to OA.,btohqsg
Same theory  once liquidated  it will go to RA if RA have not meet FRS. Will go OA if reached FRS.,btohqsg
Hi al  let's say if I have $10 spare change to invest every week. Is it advisable to use IBKR for that?,btohqsg
Heh heh. Oops sorry to stir the nest‚Ä¶.What if CPF life already started. Then u sell the SA investment say at 70 years old.,btohqsg
For this case  if RA has shortfall  it will top up to your cohort FRS  which will eventually increase your CPF Life payout. Any excess after FRS is met  it goes into your OA. üòä,btohqsg
"Yes the ""shielded"" monies.. I highly doubt will be force liquidation.. but highly possibe for the liquidated monies to be credited to RA if haven't hit FRS.. but anything above FRS  whether credit RA or OA is a question mark ü§£",btohqsg
Aiyah I tot can shield against CPF life.,btohqsg
DBS Multiplier Account. Not tested but possible. But low interest rates.,btohqsg
Seems like it  to allow you to get a choice to withdraw or transfer to RA for the increased interest rates.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm just thinking if a person doesn‚Äôt like CPF life. How to escape it,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt like the fact that interest on CPF life earned after it starts  goes to pool instead of yourself.,btohqsg
Only way is to be born before 1958 or have less than 60k at payout start age ü§£,btohqsg
Soooooooo if u shield your OA and SA when u are 64 years old. Can?,btohqsg
get a even better annuity plan?,btohqsg
You can  but eventually when it comes back in  it still goes to your RA if you have not meet the FRS  which will go into CPF LIFE still eventually.,btohqsg
Can. If you purchase own private annuity plan with cash/cpf/srs. But then the premium paid to the annuity plan won't earn interest lor. ü§£Unless the policy says it does ü§™,btohqsg
so like  its better to hit FRS asap  and enjoy a bit more of the 4% compounding when we are already racing above the FRS line  until we hit 55 and we can have ‚Äòmore‚Äô in OA?,btohqsg
How you shield SA when no more SA at 64,btohqsg
Hmmm so if at 54 I drain my OA and SA into investments. So that I have below $60k CPF fund.And I keep it that way even when I‚Äôm 64.I won‚Äôt have CPF life started right.Then when I sell all investments at 66 years old  I will have CPF life created??,btohqsg
I would agree with your front part. But at 55  I would withdraw all amounts above frs. 2.5% not worth to keep in cpf.,btohqsg
But for CPF investment  the 1st 20k in your OA and 1st 40k in your SA cannot be invested,btohqsg
So you will still have 60k in regardless,btohqsg
Ah I see. So there is no way to escape CPF life,btohqsg
Depends on bank interest rate at that point bah. If rates are ultra low and HYSA gives only 1%  may still make sense to keep in OA given the 2.5% floor.,btohqsg
Unless you don‚Äôt work all the way till payout start age  no CPF contribution  below 60k  then you won‚Äôt have CPF Life üòÖ,btohqsg

Hi for SC Smart cc  $250 min spend is within 30 days? when does it start?,btohqsg
Any suggestion on this ? üôèüèª,btohqsg
Because for long term earnings (4%) it should match with long term liquidity (SA or RA). You can‚Äôt expect any investment to give long term rates to short term funding. That‚Äôs upside down,btohqsg
not sure about krisflyer cc  currently im using citi rewards + amaze  it‚Äôs very easy to use as no need to think about mcc (not for travel tho),btohqsg
Idk if it‚Äôs sneaky or forceful. Under the current/old rules  if you haven‚Äôt reached FRS in RA and continued working after 55  wouldn‚Äôt the mandatory contribution go to SA and can‚Äôt be withdrawn as lump sum (as FRS/BRS not achieved).,btohqsg
btw side question just to check for insurance also can use amaze+CRMC?,btohqsg
never tried before  if can pay by amaze should be no prob; tho amaze now has extra 1% fee for some transaction  not sure if insurance is one of themmaybe someone more experienced could shed some light,btohqsg
How about health hub? is it consider a qualifying spend and will get 10x rewards?,btohqsg
The practical question is: other than shielding (which was meant to be 2-3 months long)  who would invest their SA and still get >4% rate? I will assume it‚Äôs super few.Shielding was performed because members want to form their FRS using more of OA over SA. That means they can attain FRS (otherwise why would they shield)? In that case when they sell SA investment  RA would have hit FRS  so the proceeds should flow to OA since RA is full.A lot of hypothetical questions but I think in reality very few will have this scenario‚Ä¶,btohqsg
In any case  many of us forgets that CPF is to help lower to lower-middle income earners. Not the richer folks‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs why there are caps in contributions.If we already have excess funds for retirements  then manage the funds ourselves instead of expecting the govt to foot the bill‚Ä¶?Many concerns flagged are those that can hit FRS but still wanna game the system for high risk-free interests,btohqsg
U can use but no reward and get charge 1 percent by amaze.,btohqsg
If you only have $10 to save each week  I would be more concerned about building up an emergency/buffer fund in cash or cash-like holdings  or aiming to save more  rather than jumping straight into equity investments.,btohqsg
Is there any high interest account at Citi ? Or any interesting account ?,btohqsg
Thank you for the info üôè,btohqsg
Hi All  just wonder if this is still valid?,btohqsg
I think of it this way instead: the interest earned in CPF life is funding the lifetime payouts.The point of contention is if that earned interest will be bequeathed to your NOK  and that is a question of higher net wealth citizen. I think leave your NOK to deal with their financial situation  esp if they‚Äôre working adults.Break even age of CPF Life is around 80 years  I think that‚Äôs a rather attainable age?Without the pooled sums  not sure if there‚Äôs any private annuities that can give the same yield CPF Life does. The other way is lump sum and spread over our retirement life but what if it runs out‚Ä¶ we reach both hands to govt for assistance?,btohqsg
Again  in the old scheme (lump sum)  idk many elders who would invest in instruments to give them interests at 65 years old. Meaning in that scheme  you would have little to no interest income to bequeath to NOK too.,btohqsg
Can i clarify that if im holding onto UOB debit card and savings account  will i be new to UOB credit card if i apply for one?,btohqsg

I am not sure about Malaysia's credit card but I had one from Maybank FC Barcelona visa signature card that gives small cash rebate and no annual fees. You can compare Malaysia and singapore ones with same card. I personally feel the credit cards in Singapore is better and way more competitive due to strong sgdEver since I knew I spend with Malaysia's credit card in Malaysia and didn't get reward well. It's better use those cash cards with good currency conversion rate (I.e. Trust card) or you use those singapores credit cards can earn better miles in overseas.,btohqsg
Sure Dave  thanks a lot for the info. So preferably to apply Maybank credit card. And obviously I can use it in Malaysia. But how's the FX rate? Do they incur that?,btohqsg
I think you misunderstood. I didn't say prefer to apply maybank credit card. You still need to research and compare. Also to each of its own and depending on your preference. For local credit cards there will be some hidden FX fees you will need to bear but I think due to strong sgd. I can bear with it. That's why many people are encouraging to use those cash cards  to name a few  trust card etc. And I think most credit cards issued in Singapore can be used in oversea as long as your setting made it can be used in overseas.Iirc  to apply credit card in Malaysia seems like you need to show your income statement in Malaysia (being employed in Malaysia). Not sure they will accept you who is a foreigner and employed in Singapore with less vested interest to apply credit card in Malaysia. You can enquire and look at their website for requirements and tnc etc. I got the credit card in Malaysia when I applied is when I am working in Malaysia before.,btohqsg
Sorry the moomoo 6.8% is only fresh fund right?Existing fund don't have?,btohqsg

A lot of people reported this 5.8% too.If 5.8% is not a real guarantee  I doubt 6.8% will be a guarantee too. You still interested in 6.8%?,btohqsg

Core 4.5% has less risk compare to 4.6%.If your fund return is 4.1%  you will get 4.1% instead of 5.8%.Core 4.5% return is guaranteed at 4.5% even if the company get return from market is only 3%.,btohqsg

Yes which is why I always like to say don‚Äôt compare the published rates of Mmf vs fixed deposit or savings account.There is always slippage for mmfs.,btohqsg
Is it Bec subscription and redemption is not immediate  so lose 1-2days at start and at end‚Ä¶ ?,btohqsg
Yeah  I can't find any mention of it anywhere  and not a peep from them until I follow up. Makes me wonder how much of the customer base is being kept in the dark about this dishonest behavior. no different to stealing.,btohqsg
Yes to this also. And also the way they start interest accrualsTLDR: mmf and fixed deposit/ savings account yields are not exactly comparable. Not to mention credit risk also.,btohqsg
Of course AIA. They're the billing org.,btohqsg
Unfortunately their call Center is not open on weekends,btohqsg
Perhaps you want to check when you deposited the fund previously  did you get the interest next day before your fund actually subscribed to MMF 2-4 days later?,btohqsg
I never check my moomoo mmf  because I keep add/withdraw  so it‚Äôs hard,btohqsg
"The document should appear on My AIA SG app anyway  no need to call to check.Usually takes 5-7 working days after they posted.Based on ""more than a week""  I'm assuming the payment was posted before 6 Feb?",btohqsg
This should be more than 5-7 working days till now,btohqsg
Does that mean you cannot get 5.8% Because you have withdrawal? Is there a TnC that if have withdrawal  no 5.8%?,btohqsg

Does UOB lady travel category work on in Japan bus/ mrt travels? Like buying Shinkansen from the counter or top up money in suica card ?,btohqsg
No. But dp have said buying whole Japan pass directly from website is covered by Uob lady travel category.,btohqsg
Maybe just anything buy from Klook safer.,btohqsg
Klook and Pelago are very safe for Uob lady travel,btohqsg

Yea if can choose everyone will game. Just need 2 supp cards to get all the categories üòú,btohqsg

Have someone used both UOB PPV and/or UOB Krisflyer CC+Amaze ?I figured the spending categories to be roughly similar  but earn rate 4mpd/max 1110$ per month on PPV  and 3mpd uncapped if 800$ yearly spend on SIA for the Krisflyer+amaze.Anyone have any feedback/tips on one or both cards ?,btohqsg

If you can wait 14 months for the bonus point to come and also wether if the point are actually accurate on the KF+ amaze ü§îWhy not both ?

Hello! üëãJust want to check if anyone applied for the rising dragons promo for the first qualifying period not gotten the cash credit/earmarked yet?I removed (29dec )and deposit funds and registered (2 Jan ).Not sure if I missed a step and just wanna check if there are any unfortunate folks like me still waiting for their funds to be earmarked.. üòÖ,btohqsg
Most were earmarked on 14th but UOB's tnc said cut off date for earmarking and crediting is 29 Feb so maybe wait ba.You did receive the registration email right?,btohqsg
You are not alone. Mine is also not earmarked yet. CSO said that earmarking is happening in batches,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply! Was actually thinking of covering travel with a Ladys card (unsure if the 6mpd will extend beyond 31march though). Was just concerned by the 1110$ cap on PPV  since i‚Äôll soon have to buy lots of furnitures and will for sure. But you‚Äôre right  might as well get both cards üòÖWas actually wondering at what point the KF CC+ amaze at 3mpd without cap would outperform the PPV 4mpd with cap (speaking only about miles)?Do you know if pairing KF CC+amaze negates the UOB$ merchants lower earning rate? (Meaning if you use amaze for a UOB merchant  do you get the lower earning rate or the bonus earning rate ? ),btohqsg
Yes it does amaze will negate the UOB$   there is article by milelion covering this specific topicYou can also add UOB VS to expand your spending up to another $2kYou can simply just take the capLet say$3000 all into PPV(1110 x 4 ) + ( 1900 x 0.4 ) = 5160Comparing to $3000 UOB KF(3000 x 3mpd ) = 9000Clearly can see it already close to 2xI think there are some furniture store in Kris+ if there are and it have what you want then that should be your go toHipvan is one of them 6mpd + 3 mpd with UOB KFhttps://milelion.com/2023/04/30/workarounds-how-to-earn-miles-at-uob-merchants-with-uob-cards/,btohqsg

Hey I have a question. If interest in RA does not belong to us and belong to the pool  is it then a better thing to start withdrawing  the cPf payouts at age 65 then to wait until 70 to start withdrawing?,btohqsg
Actually I don't get why ppl keep saying interest in RA does not belong to self.RA and CPF Life are 2 separate things. You can use RA to pay the premium for CPF Life annuity. You can increase your CPF Life payouts if you pay higher premiums from your RA.RA earns it's own interest and credited into RA  after death it'll be distributed alongside all other amounts as stated in your CPF nomination.CPF Life premiums earns it's own interest and credited into CPF Life (pooled with every other CPF Life). Remaining unused premiums will be distributed as above.RA does not magically disappear  unlike SA at 55 (in 2025).,btohqsg
let me call scb tomorrow  because my aia date already passed a weekk,btohqsg
So you are saying it‚Äôs ok to still keep money in RA until 70 to earn more interest and use that to pay premiums for CPF life? So meaning as long as you don‚Äôt withdraw  whatever interest u earn from 55 to 65 or 70 will still be yours since it will be paid as premiums for the CPF life plan? sorry for the noob question as I am trying to figure out what best for me. :),btohqsg
Yes like that. So I scanned and then there‚Äôs an error message. So I tried again. Then I close and relaunch app and tried.The I thought maybe I need to activate something but of course at point of payment I just swiftly pay other ways.,btohqsg
Where did you try to pay,btohqsg
It‚Äôs nothing to do with my Apple Pay have multiple cards registered right‚Ä¶after all each time I want to use Apple Pay I kinda can select the card.,btohqsg
No registration required for xnap. Just download the app to use,btohqsg
Jan is tricky because 1 Jan is holiday. so if you put in 100 000 on 2nd Jan  your monthly daily average balance will be less than 100 000 so won't be ear marked,btohqsg
This one is from a reliable source if it answers your question. I saved this info since I also wanted to know.‚ÄúOnly cpf life premium interest will go to the pool. The interest earned from 55 to payout age anytime from 65 to 70 is part of your ra savings  thereafter it depends on your cpf life plan chosen‚Äù,btohqsg
I don't recall any Kopitiam that supports XNAP but I might be wrong. But if you're at Kopitiam you should use Fairprice Group app since they give 10% discount by default on most purchases.Maybe check the SGQR again if it has XNAP or LiquidPay QR.,btohqsg
I don't think they see MAB for earmarking  but just the participating amounts.,btohqsg
Does the daily average matter? The qualifying criteria should be incremental fresh funds of $100k?,btohqsg
This shop don‚Äôt have that fair price app payment.But I think maybe this shop don‚Äôt support Xnap payment. Coz it‚Äôs had only like about 8 payments types on that QR..Maybe that was my issue.,btohqsg
let me try to find the fineprints. I recall got something like this.,btohqsg
It all depends on your needs... Don't be too focused on the nitty gritty like interest rates. Ask yourself if you need the payouts from 65. If you still have a stable income  you can choose to defer until later. Some people may want to take out at 65 so they can change to a less demanding job with a lower pay at that age. Others may choose to defer if they want to hit ERS before their payouts start so they can stop working altogether.,btohqsg
I can confirm no need MAB because I have 2 humans that opened their account in mid Jan and got their 100k earmarked. They only deposited 100k then.,btohqsg
Mab is for uob one interest  uob promo just need to 100k in and dont fall under it before amt been earmark,btohqsg
strange. my personal experience it doesn't get earmarked until I try to register again the next month.,btohqsg
The tnc states aggregate of end day balance of 31 Dec and participating deposit only haha.,btohqsg
Anyone can send me souper Loong please üôèüèª,btohqsg
mine was Xmas promo. it didn't get earmarked and I have to register again the next month.,btohqsg
probably due to other reasons  nothing to do with MAB,btohqsg
Login to UOB apps n check thePDF statement. See what is the closing balance as of 31 Dec 2023?I believe you maybe out by few dollars.,btohqsg
greatest mind here. I am not able to change my salary credit away from UOB. Is there any high interest rate saving account I can put money in without company salary crediting if I have maxed 100k at UOB one .,btohqsg
Can consider holding in money market funds either directly (buy into the fund yourself) or indirectly (e.g. syfe cash  stashaway simple  endowus cash smart),btohqsg

Just to be sure I transferred  more than was required for the earmarked. So I don‚Äôt think this is the issue.. I hope.. ü§û,btohqsg
Hmm just that sometimes their merchant code nvr categorise properly Thn cn loophole,btohqsg
You can try and find out,btohqsg
Under current system  if you have not reached FRS at age55   salary will still flow to SA/OA/MA. You will not be permitted to take out money from SA/OA (other than the 5K) as you have not hit FRS. Then at age 65  there will be another round of transfer to RA to try to hit FRS.,btohqsg
The new system will immediately transfer salary CPF to RA(previously earmarked for SA),btohqsg
Unless you can get more than 2.5% interest else where  there is no need to withdraw from CPF OA . Note withdraw is easy  put back is difficult,btohqsg

You‚Äôre below 40  the CPF changes doesn‚Äôt affect you and what you should do‚Ä¶,btohqsg
If more then 1k how? Say $3-4k what should I used instead?,btohqsg
https://heymax.aiDepends what you‚Äôre spending on. Use this to guide you,btohqsg
Both. Travel (tour agency) and non travel (gadget furniture etcc),btohqsg
There are many 4 mpd cards that can cover these categories,btohqsg
It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt seems worth it to get lady just to cover travel (tour agencies) expenses right?Especially since it‚Äôs only 1k max,btohqsg
Some tour agency can spilt payment if the tour date is still very long,btohqsg
Depends how much you are going to spend. Most 4mpd cards also have a cap of $1 000 and only DBS WWMC has $2 000 (next month will reduce to $1 500) and UOB VS has $2 000,btohqsg
Depends on your circumstances  like what cards and miles you have now  whether they‚Äôre pooled or not  etc. again heymax.aiwill help in the absence of such information to us,btohqsg
Is it‚Äôs better to pay up to 1k under lady‚Äôs first then the rest via a Amex card for cashback?,btohqsg
Cannot suggest you anything without knowing the full picture,btohqsg
As I currently have paid the deposits for a tour agency  and have a remaining fees of 4k to pay. So I‚Äôm just wondering which card is best for miles considering that lady‚Äôs only give a max cap of 1kWill look into heymax but just wanna have an opinion from the general public first,btohqsg
If can paywave  UOB Lady‚Äôs ($1000) + UOB VS ($2000) + UOB PPV ($1000) would be best. UNI$ pools across all of them,btohqsg
There is no right or wrong to use miles to redeem which airline ticket. If your miles are going to expire this month end n currently you only this holiday plan to buy budget airline ticket   n the to be expired miles are not enough to fully redeem other full fledged air ticket. This seems to be the best option.,btohqsg
You need to consider  are you playing the miles game for long or only this instance? If you don‚Äôt have existing uob miles card  then will this one off instance leave you with orphan points that you cannot redeem as miles.Are you really focusing on miles only  or open to both (since now you mentioned you‚Äôre looking at CB too). It‚Äôs really dependent on your situation and goals,btohqsg
On mile in the long run. I plan to get a card that can get back when I purchase furnitures as well as big price gadget which HSBC revo seems good,btohqsg

1-2 banks will be good  don‚Äôt spread out too much and then you have orphan points all over that competes for expiry date.Unless of course the one-off spend is large enough for the min 10K miles redemption block (or if there are sign up bonuses).

UOB VS is also good and has a higher cap. I believe you‚Äôll paywave for furniture anyway. And also by distributing your points across multiple banks you‚Äôll end up with orphan points everywhere,btohqsg

You can transfer your points to airline miles in blocks only (UOB: 5000 UNI$ = 10000 miles  HSBC: 25000 pts = 10000 miles). E.g you have 4999 UNI$  you cannot convert it to miles.,btohqsg

Maybe good to watch some Singapore YouTube videos on miles game introduction. So you know what you‚Äôre getting into,btohqsg
Why would there be orphan points then if I can accumulate the UNIS from multiple transactions and then convert them at once?,btohqsg
Hmmm the answer to this specific question is that of Owen‚Äôs reply. If you don‚Äôt get the uni$ in those blocks  then the bank points can‚Äôt be converted in fractional miles.But the reply you quoted was more on the mechanics of how most miles card works. Bank issues points  you convert those points to airline miles (in blocks). Bank points and miles have their own expiry dates. Some bank cards auto converts and pushes to airline miles,btohqsg

Nevermind just found it  they‚Äôre only revisions on baggage allowance and complimentary seat selection,btohqsg
so before mar 24  what are the benefits of uob cc?,btohqsg
ok la at least got boardmefirst ü•≤,btohqsg
What is the benefit of boardmefirst?,btohqsg
"not much  u just become the first group to board (which means no need fight for cabin ""luggage space"")actually experienced it first hand during my last trip",btohqsg
Anybody use complimentary seat selection before ? Is this benefit allowed you to manual seat selection or they auto assign seat for you?,btohqsg
Is there any ocbc 365 cc sign up promo now,btohqsg
I thought cabin luggage space is always sufficient for everyone? I never encountered insufficient space.,btohqsg
You manual select before using complimentary seat selection ?I heard it is auto assigned by system. Is it true?,btohqsg
paiseh  i meant carry on luggage if there's a diff. last trip i went the person who went after me didn't had much space because my travel partner and i  had two carry-on luggages so that ate quite alot of space,btohqsg
I roughly recall one hahaha  but i rmb manually selecting cause i asked for a window seat and paid for my partner's seat (like... a specific seat),btohqsg
they assign you some seats first  then you can change them within the STANDARD SEATS if you want  any charges will be waived.https://milelion.com/2022/06/01/psa-scoots-ridiculous-complimentary-seat-selection-perk/,btohqsg
Possible to have insufficient  I encounter before they asked people before boarding to check in luggage for free,btohqsg
if flying out from Narita  many jokers like me might carry on 2-3 bags of duty free snacks... sure no space one,btohqsg
oh  this i tio before also (another flight)But overall the idea is that i get some assurance my luggage is above me so i don't have to like move around too much when landing and wanting to disembark from the plane,btohqsg
Just put it in other luggage space above other passenger if still have empty space  Right?,btohqsg
"up to indiv lo  imagine u got plastic bag got luggage u also dont want partition between different ""shelves"" ma",btohqsg
and u don't want other people heavy luggage crushing your precious snacks,btohqsg
Hi experts  I have a technical question - the FRS for 2025 is $213K.If my SA balance reaches above $213K as at 31 Dec 2025  after the interest is added  would this mean I have reached the FRS balance already and I cannot RSTU anymore?,btohqsg
wait for FRS limit to be raised on 1st Jan 2026 then quickly topup,btohqsg
I am wondering if the tax saved from RSTU will outweigh the interest earned when FRS is reached.,btohqsg
depends how good you are at investments.there are people who don't do SRS for the same reasons.,btohqsg
Hi to those that have bought savvy endowment via DBS app to tick the Insurance component for Multiplier  how soon is the policy incepted from the date of online application? ie if I bought today when is the policy incepted? Thank you.,btohqsg
Interest will be credited on 31 Dec. there is no chance for you to topup SA anymore once reached FRS. You can only topup your Medisave.,btohqsg
Nice to meet you all :),btohqsg
Can I seek some advice. I'm going Melbourne in March and thinking of getting a good 4mpd and above card for spending there . Currently I haveUoB Prvi miles Mastercard- 2.4mpd overseas spend nDBS Altitude Visa- abt 2.2mpd.Any recommendations on wat cardwill.begood to.apply?I'm thinking of citi.rewards + amaze or uob ladies card or solitare. Tks for.the advice.,btohqsg
It depends on your income tax tier also. Can reduce income tax & earn 4% I feel it's a good deal.,btohqsg
Amaze + Lady‚Äôs to reduce your FX on related spends. CRMC + amaze good too (like you mentioned).,btohqsg
Currently  any miles card suggestion to use with iPayMy/Cardup for mortgage payment (1400/month)?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúCardup calculator‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
I use uob prvi miles. 1.4md,btohqsg
Tks for reply.Lady is capped at 1kSolitaire at 3kN crmc at 1k.. right?,btohqsg
For Lady‚Äôs  will overseas spend in stores  restaurants etc. be seen in the respective merchant codes or all would be under Travel?,btohqsg
Merchants have their own MCC based on nature of business. So if it‚Äôs a restaurant then the MCC is as such,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt confuse currency of spend with nature (aka mcc),btohqsg
But in certain case  mcc might not match nature of business,btohqsg
Finally they adjusted and paid me. If I don't complain.... Haha!  For those who subscribed  better check upon matured,btohqsg
Correct  but what I‚Äôm saying is just because a spend is incurred during a holiday overseas doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ‚Äòtravel‚Äô,btohqsg
Yup i got that part  just to highlight that it not all mcc match the nature of business,btohqsg
