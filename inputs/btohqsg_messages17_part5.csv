Since the rules for rejecting flat selection kicks in from Aug BTO. I assume if I apply for May BTO and got it  I can still reject it and not be subjected to the 1 year penalty right?,btohqsg
as long as you have not selected the flat during flat selection,btohqsg
If I reject flat selection in the first place for May BTOif HDB calls me to go  I still can reject it without any penalties right?,btohqsg

If your household's income is more than 9000  you do not qualify for EHG. You can read this hdb page for full info on how EHG works and the criteria involvedhttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/residential/buying-a-flat/understanding-your-eligibility-and-housing-loan-options/flat-and-grant-eligibility/couples-and-families/enhanced-cpf-housing-grant-families,btohqsg
it‚Äôs will be based on both the applicants only right?,btohqsg
"From the page: ""For first-timer households:The average gross monthly household income (including all applicants and occupiers) for the months worked during the 12-month period must not exceed $9 000""",btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know anything about the process of withdrawing from the MCPS?,btohqsg
Depending on what stage are u,btohqsg
Got the appt letter but haven‚Äôt gone for the appt yet  would you have to know what comes next?,btohqsg
But if I‚Äôm not wrong MCPS is under public queue?,btohqsg
public q is split into 2 subsets  mcps and public scheme. Eg: Mcps A  public scheme B  public scheme Cscenario: U balloted and got a q number of 100. this means that 100 is the best number out of the 3 ballots (A B C. B and C can be any number after 100  or even no number)Not sure if there‚Äôs a process of withdrawing from mcps  but if u can  it means u will get a further q number B and C  or even no number at all if B and C weren‚Äôt successful,btohqsg
but seeing as how you‚Äôve already gotten the appt date  i don‚Äôt think u can withdraw from it now? If u withdraw means u forfeit your number and u don‚Äôt get a flat,btohqsg
