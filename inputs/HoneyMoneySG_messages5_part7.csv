Hi  I have a question. Should I move majority of my savings into Anchor Protocol since it gives more than 19% APY  which outperforms most investments currently.,btohqsg
Up to you but personally I would keep few months emergency savings with easy access. Shouldn‚Äôt touch emergency fund. Only invest what you are okay to lose into it,btohqsg
DeFi still too risky to dump all your savings into,btohqsg
But I am also not familiar with anchor protocol (&crypto in general) üòÖ maybe others can chime in,btohqsg
I only have DBS/POSB debit card. I still can apply for this right?,btohqsg
What would be the best way to top up grab wallet?,btohqsg

Hi Chris  just want to hear your opinions and strategy in terms of top up to cpf with regards to budget 2022 announcements: cpf annual increase of 3.5% in BRS  FRS and ERS. Not sure if you will have a new video on that but definitely your previous videos help alot too !,btohqsg
Will talk about it in my budget video,btohqsg

I intend to use ipaymy or cardup to pay for my insurance. Any senpai willing to explain to me how it works?,btohqsg
Just got mycrypto.comcard how to use. Need to stack or just buy Cro can use,btohqsg
You got the card without staking any CRO?,btohqsg
You need not need to stake if you got the midnight blue card  just top-up with your card can use liao,btohqsg
If you want stake for a higher card u need buy cro then can stake  but if u want the card to be shipped need to pay sgd50 else u still enjoy the same benefits as what you staked,btohqsg
That‚Äôs right. This is my personal opinion. If you want to get intocrypto.comcard  I‚Äôll encourage you to stake $500 CRO and get the Ruby Red tier.,btohqsg
You‚Äôll get 2% cashback in CRO and have your Spotify subscription 100% rebate back to you. So technically you are DCA into CRO every month.,btohqsg
Is topping card like revolut or youtrip card using the Amex Absolute eligible for the 1.7% cashback?,btohqsg
On Youtrip app it only shows Visa and MC,btohqsg
I see. Have go through the long of way using the grabpay mastercard,btohqsg
Hello all. Has anyone ever used OCBC titanium rewards with Amaze card? Does it really work like the Citi rewards paired with amaze,btohqsg
Irrc  some credit card reward is only eligible for the particular merchant  not category or MCC. Look at ocbc titanium‚Äôs extra 2% at Best Denki. It‚Äôs very highly that ocbc is looking for ‚ÄúBest Denki‚Äù. But if you use Amaze card  ‚Äú*Amaze‚Äù will appear in front and that transaction is not eligible for extra cash back.,btohqsg
Minus Uob as they have excluded amaze card from their points and rewards,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGfor cards that have minimum spend  does minimum spend have exception? Like utilities  preschool fee  medical fee  insurance  and telecom bill ? I cannot find exact explanation about this,btohqsg
You need to check each cards tnc,btohqsg
Anyone still has standard chartered Manhattan card? Any paywave or tap to pay function?,btohqsg
Guys  is it ok to buy VOO using syfe trade? No commission?,btohqsg
My Manhattan card no wave function  waiting for new card after the current card expires next year,btohqsg
Guys  is it ok to buy VOO using syfe trade? No commission?,btohqsg
Yes  it's fine. No commission for 5 trades per month for now,btohqsg
Remember to make 3x $10 unique transactions üëç,btohqsg
Since Chris is here  I rmb Syfe trade only trade in US market. Does mean it would be better to use revolut card to top up USD?,btohqsg
Tried before last year but revolut transfer didn't work for syfe,btohqsg
