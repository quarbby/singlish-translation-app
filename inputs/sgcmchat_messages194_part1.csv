if this isn't financially digging your own grave then surely throwing bank notes into a open fire is a great alternative,btohqsg
Excuse me  I troll what ??,btohqsg
I wished owning a car wasn‚Äôt that expensive üò≠,btohqsg
it wouldn't be if you had some common sense dipshit,btohqsg
When I ask I troll what  u ignore me like I don‚Äôt exist  all you do is just sit there and just happily warn me,btohqsg
1.7k monthly300 fuel (98  admittedly)$100 if you divide roadtax into a monthly basis,btohqsg
can‚Äôt be everything I say that needed me to be warned   do I need to repeat myself ?,btohqsg
and this is for a high spec non-COE E class.,btohqsg
and thats for a mercs eh,btohqsg
get your money up not your funny up,btohqsg
i must admit we only pump 98 because it's what any car deserves,btohqsg
For my case I suppose .,btohqsg
so you can shave off maybe $40-50 if you stick with 95,btohqsg
i change my rims and paint every two months,btohqsg
therefore it is very expensive to own a car,btohqsg
$2500 is alot of money  Im just going broke already .,btohqsg
U have no idea whatever I do,btohqsg
you should put it all on red,btohqsg
nah i would put it on 38,btohqsg
Don't think anyone is pissed at you for spending $2.5k per month on a mazda3,btohqsg
Not like that pay for it.,btohqsg
I never used anyone‚Äôs money either too,btohqsg
once again if you're shelling out 2.5k a month for a mazda 3,btohqsg
you could've gone and gotten a fucking 2018 530i with loads of room for mods,btohqsg
At most you will just be surprised  why will you be pissed that something u don‚Äôt have to worry about ?,btohqsg
this is the most i've laughed in a long while,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt Mazda well-liked by drivers for the steering especially??,btohqsg
2018 530i nowadays might be around 1.8-1.9 monthly300 for fuel and 100 for roadtax is very good imo,btohqsg
having driven a mazda 3 the steering feedback is absolutely dogshit,btohqsg
Then I will be complaining by now  but no my car steering feels just right as it is  no abnormalities (yet).,btohqsg
and how the dynamics of the road surface is transmitted,btohqsg
not abnormalities bro. Think he talking about general quality,btohqsg
the mazda 3 has numb ass steering,btohqsg
comparing it to a 2014 altis,btohqsg
the altis feels so much more well built and has significantly better road feel lol.,btohqsg
Then why would my other car friends use Mazda for their leisure drive when they have other better cars.,btohqsg
if its a to b fuck care whatever it is,btohqsg
You want a present ? üéÅ,btohqsg
i think ur friends arent ur friends if they tell u 2.5k for a mazda is ok,btohqsg
but you're saying a maz3 has better steering feel than a G30 5 series,btohqsg
I also got friend drive toyota everyday but got lambo at home leh. why not drive lambo everydayü§£,btohqsg
Of course it is not okay.,btohqsg
then why are you justifying 2.5k is ok,btohqsg
but better car according to your logic mah,btohqsg
i got car but i keep at carpark,btohqsg
call this number to voice your 2.5k monthly concerns,btohqsg
You want a best sticker award or an Oscar?,btohqsg
Being pissed at it is not gonna do anything about it.,btohqsg
who says we‚Äôre pissed at it,btohqsg
And they‚Äôll prolly scold u back for paying tht much üòÇ,btohqsg
