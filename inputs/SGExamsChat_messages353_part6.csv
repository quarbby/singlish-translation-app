I got C for N level I happy liao,btohqsg
the trigo graph question for P1 is pretty much similar to 2015 p1 question,btohqsg
reminds me of an o lvl qn,btohqsg
or was it a prelim qn I forgot,btohqsg
I rmb I saw this type of qn somewhere before,btohqsg
ye but I saw on a prelim ppr before,btohqsg
I think part (ii)(b)is l = pi/2 - k?,btohqsg
you got the qn ppr alr,btohqsg
itâ€™s gna be afternoon in 9 mins,btohqsg
but I haven't receive the paper yet,btohqsg
maybe cher not in sch today,btohqsg
N level A math as for now,btohqsg
I cant do the part 2b eh,btohqsg
x = pi/3 or x = 2pi/3,btohqsg
need alot of visualisation about it,btohqsg
slot student struggle cos this question nvr really come out before.,btohqsg
wait i still dont get it,btohqsg
When they want us to describe shaded area can we say it is the distance for deceleration or must we say when the speed decrease?,btohqsg
yes there is no need for working,btohqsg
just manually find m and l,btohqsg
diff between y coord at pi/2 and k,btohqsg
but you are required to find,btohqsg
damn I thought this one is just eyeing type of qn,btohqsg
5+2 = 7 5-2 = 3,btohqsg
just focus on difference of y-coord at pi/2 and k,btohqsg
if let say y= cos 2x,btohqsg
then see the diff in y-coord at L and 0,btohqsg
5- 3cos 2x = 7-3 cos 2x = 2cos 2x = -2/35 - 3cos 2x = 3-3 cos 2x = -2/3cos 2x = 2/3,btohqsg
