Just buy $1 to win the jackpot 😂,btohqsg
Yess great talking to you! Cheers and good night!!,btohqsg
If there is one classic car i could import. I think it would be a 300sl. Or maybe a eleanor mustang,btohqsg
It's like getting an SLS roadster instead of the gullwing,btohqsg
If could wanna ask bmw if can build another M1,btohqsg
Yall don’t know how to sleep is it,btohqsg
I've been doing stupid things like taking a nap at 9pm,btohqsg
End up waking at 1 or 2 am and  awake all night can't sleep,btohqsg
“New blood”… does remind me of something else 😅😅😅 now which channel did I hear that phrase from hmmm hmmm!! 🤔,btohqsg
Just continue to drive the A3 unless you can find a hybrid that you can buy without any top up. Because likely you will have to pay more road tax anyway.A3 no matter what still has good paper value.,btohqsg
Don’t make sense to me from my simple mind perspective. Running cost aside   you would be letting go of a car which you had bought at a good price  and replacing it with a new high book value car for what it is. Downgrade and sucking it up would be changing to a basic 6 year old Jap or Korean car for example,btohqsg
a little tough sell to suck it up and buy a new car sir ☺️,btohqsg
Huh? What do you mean sir? - J,btohqsg
https://fb.watch/exCoMgSUB1/NSX in Singapore can buy 4 NSX in north America 😅,btohqsg
That was the idea  but on hindsight  i think the 300sl is more expensive hahaha,btohqsg
Ya'll are very hardworking people leh helping us do research till 1am!! But yeah indeed the 'sports car' category is a very grey area. These days there are tons of 4-door cars that are also performance and driving oriented.,btohqsg
Hardcore new Porsche 911 GT3 RS to be revealed on 17 August 2022The Porsche 911 GT3 will be getting an even more hardcore brother in the form of the 911 GT3 RS!👉🏻 React with 🔥 if the 911 GT3 RS is your favourite Porsche!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
i talked to our ops team  it is indeed hard to define. Nowadays we try to determine it by the manufacturers intention. So it's not fixed based on a strict '2 door coupe' definition. Thats why you will see Type R  GTI etc being defined as sports cars,btohqsg
lucky mine is been defined as a luxury car,btohqsg
Which begs the question - would ya'll consider a high performance SUV to be a sports car?,btohqsg
nowadays sports car dont perform like sports car  and luxury car dont perform like luxury car,btohqsg
That is very logical indeed to go by manufacturers’ intent.,btohqsg
Which then begs the question: what characteristic(s) define a sports car?,btohqsg
Not to me personally. I would though consider the mx5 to be a sports car: well build engine  light weight  low  great handling.,btohqsg
Looks and a few sticker here and there,btohqsg
Like suv   vezel is consider a suv ? Or just a sedan with high heels,btohqsg
Hahahaha yeah more and more so these days,btohqsg
Sports car is more of a mentality of the driver   like an Audi A3 slap with a few sticker   and change exhaust also is a sports car,btohqsg
Even a vezel with rs sticker is also like driving a sports car,btohqsg
Ya so it like a hatchback with high heels la haha,btohqsg
So like Suzuki Swift Sport also count too?,btohqsg
I see no relevance of been a suv with cramp interior   front wheel drive   low power engine and poor handling,btohqsg
It more like marketing terms now,btohqsg
sg dun really need SUV. mlysia maybe where there's a lot kampung bumpy roads,btohqsg
Like my car is categorized as luxury sedan and I see no connection to it,btohqsg
Like golf R-line  i30 N line  318i M Sport,btohqsg
actually  can i suggest a change?,btohqsg
instead of lumping as performance car,btohqsg
but xmm won't relate these cars as sports car. they will think it just a cheap car trying to be sports car,btohqsg
performance is variable from brand to brand,btohqsg
But what about non performance coupes?,btohqsg
Sigh.. that's why... scirocco 1.4 > M3,btohqsg
What if I want a performance coupe sports car?,btohqsg
if u want a specific car  that are more options to choose,btohqsg
thats where u can use metrics like transmission type  engine size  hp,btohqsg
scirocco is ghost of 40 tiang😹😹,btohqsg
screenshot from some random rocco owner😂😂😂,btohqsg
Ya once your xmm pregnant with your child  can upgrade to golf (gti),btohqsg
I really some 1 like this,btohqsg
SG many Motorcross height hump hahahaha. So need SUV 😂,btohqsg
actually golf is pretty spacious for a small family of 4. look small outside but inside space quite ample,btohqsg
pretty fast too if you get the higher spec,btohqsg
i see so many singaporeans fly over the humps without braking,btohqsg
I also do that with sedan,btohqsg
then suddenly hear the suspension frash,btohqsg
Ya man damn stress. I have coilovers so i had to slow down  the prius tailgate me over the hump,btohqsg
Then owners complain why shocks fail so fast.,btohqsg
most likely not their car. when I rent car I go over hump no brake at all too😂😂,btohqsg
Don’t stress. Just know you’re protecting your $hock$,btohqsg
Now many suv lower Thier car   I even saw some 1 need to do the zigzag move at hump,btohqsg
1 sec air time+50 points 😂👍,btohqsg
I nearly died laughing in the car,btohqsg
You go see a lot of vezel and chr doing that,btohqsg
Should have taken a pic to share,btohqsg
Lowering is a new level man,btohqsg
they notice their car with high heels got severe body roll,btohqsg
Hahahaha exactly  they buy the wrong car liao,btohqsg
Lowered SUV.Get the heightGet the boot spaceGet the cornering feels5 🌟😂👍,btohqsg
i also last time wanted join in the trend to drive suv,btohqsg
after test drive really not suitable for me,btohqsg
I’m short. I will need a ladder to climb into one.,btohqsg
the height advantage is just so overrated,btohqsg
as aero dynamic is like crap,btohqsg
Kena take photo by@bbfasingaporeand die laughing,btohqsg
I do this on a stock car if there's nobody behind me and not in any rush...,btohqsg
stock car is best  just go only,btohqsg
and some place u know the parking  the height is taller for the clearance at the back,btohqsg
i seen ppl lower car  and just hear the bang sound,btohqsg
and the sales keep telling me,btohqsg
how fast the car acceleration is,btohqsg
Surprisingly ppl say  sitting in x3 feels giddy,btohqsg
and how good the cornering is,btohqsg
I surprised to hear ppl saying cx8 more comfortable… not from my words,btohqsg
But the luxury of x3 is better,btohqsg
my colleague too. bought the MG SUV. he say dun like the drive.sold within months. lucky after he bought it Coe on the uptrend,btohqsg
i never seat in cx8 before haha,btohqsg
i only know i sit in vezel when take grab,btohqsg
if i sit behind i will die,btohqsg
But then again… suv drive can’t compare to sedan,btohqsg
If u don’t need the space  just keep to sedan,btohqsg
I tried to drive CX5 when i drove car club car for work... almost soiled myself when i went a little too fast on BKE PIE exit,btohqsg
and the car feel like floating when above 100,btohqsg
those are just hatch back with bigger higher wheels,btohqsg
but prefer to sit in an s class,btohqsg
Which is the trend these days also,btohqsg
maybe just for me if i compare a jazz to a vezel,btohqsg
i just find that it is a jazz on heels,btohqsg
Heard someone from Malaysia says the drive is better than cx8,btohqsg
I sat in mitsubishi outlander hind seat b4. I dun find it any spacious aso... 🤔,btohqsg
SUVs these days are honestly just Hatchback on high heels.,btohqsg
Seats higher  feels like they can see more. Reality they all still use blind spot and parking mirrors despite their height advantage.,btohqsg
Now I know why he lowered,btohqsg
Lowered culture😆 Mazda CX5 ABIT too low😄,btohqsg
Actually what is there to see lol and if it is a lorry or another suv infront also nothing to see,btohqsg
"SUV's got popular because they felt safer but the gas mileage sucked and people wanted ""carlike"" rides from their truck-based SUV's. Enter the car-platform based crossover.Now they have their higher sitting vehicle that gets decent mileage  rides like a car  and isn't a minivan. Bada bing bada boom  every mom wants one  and that takes us to where we are todaAlso.. think about it Minivans exist but nobody wants to be caught dead in one  so they started buying SUV's.",btohqsg
They all just want a truck/van that is not a truck/van and does not drive like a truck/van.,btohqsg
Probably not a popular opinion  but I quite like the lexus ux200 looks,btohqsg
Now Toyota has Corolla Cross Hybrid .SUV with good FC,btohqsg
Women feel more secure somehow being high and being able to see further in front,btohqsg
that is provided the car in front of you is shorter haha,btohqsg
yes corolla cross  better than yaris cross. Yaris the hatchback is good  but not the suv. passenger roof too low,btohqsg
or is it they wanted to be seen😛,btohqsg
Pax with car sicknesses need to seat in car with large window and windscreen.My wife has car sicknesses. She felt giddy in Vellfire/Alphard during test drive. Seat too high.Very comfortable on Honda Freed. Due to larger windscreen and side window. 👍😅 happy wife  happy life & safer drive 😂,btohqsg
Depends  my wife likes low cars  sedans especially 😁,btohqsg
suv is outdated  drive a bus is better,btohqsg
you are lucky ... save half the price😛,btohqsg
Saw once and was amazed by the size,btohqsg
Malay with big family will opt for vellfire,btohqsg
freed is a very practical car in sg context,btohqsg
4235mm long very easy to park😂👍,btohqsg
Walking over to see carnival now,btohqsg
Yuppp  hence the proposal to base the category more on performance and less on body style,btohqsg
The 3RS is a great car and the 992 3RS will definitely be amazing on track  but with the Singaporean context  I don't think there is any use of having a 3RS because it is incredibly track focussed. Makes more sense if you live in Europe or North America and have access to multiple different tracks and track days,btohqsg
And Porsche products tend to be easier to get on track as well as they don't break the sound limitations either unlike the Huracan STO which can't go on most tracks or can only last a lap before it gets kicked off,btohqsg
For the sake of convenience  I would class them as luxury SUVs but in reality they are classed as sports SUVs/super SUVs,btohqsg
Yes  this is what@FatFingers15and I meant!,btohqsg
"Everything classed as body style first  more performance oriented variants classed as ""performance car""",btohqsg
but... i tot its wrong to class people according to their... body type,btohqsg
Mr Xun  we are classifying cars eh,btohqsg
but yes i think coupe cab crossover suv is a good way to filter,btohqsg
wld be good if can use hp to filter to,btohqsg
Wanted to see  but old Kia showroom at ubi no more,btohqsg
i went to see that day when i saw the cerato,btohqsg
idk how ppl drive tht in sg,btohqsg
Yuppp  and there needs to be a split in SUV classifications as well like there is for sedans,btohqsg
But if u check the spec… the size isn’t really as big as what we visual,btohqsg
it's  just a matter of getting used to the dimension.. but I still prefer normal size car as daily driver . less chance to Kena scratch😂,btohqsg
Big car  when u drive  ppl tends to give more space,btohqsg
dun Kena those ah Beng driver😂,btohqsg
I always thought odyssey is very huge,btohqsg
The carnival shrinks around you more than an alphard and odyssey when you are driving,btohqsg
But comparing the spec size  my car is bigger,btohqsg
I know that the carnival is bigger than the odyssey,btohqsg
That’s why I want to view carnival,btohqsg
5.1m long and weight more than 2 ton😅 think is diesel engine same as Kia Sorento diese lShag.,btohqsg

Difficult to find job.Do business with Arab. You vomit blood first,btohqsg

"U fixed appointment with Arab. Let say 12pm.They tell you: ""ok 12pm in god's will""If they come late. You are lucky.Most likely won't turn up😂Unless you are Royalty",btohqsg
coke is more expensive than petrol😂😂,btohqsg
Add ice to petrol  maybe taste better than coke,btohqsg
Their ancestors can survive on just Milk and Dates.,btohqsg
I would think its actually a good time to sell and buy a higher value 2nd hand car. Yes sell high  buy high but you get higher parf at the end for your new car,btohqsg
"But definitely not good to sell and ""downgrade"" to lower value new car",btohqsg
best time to buy will always be low Coe period... no need think too much... old car bring more worries,btohqsg
Of cos of cos... Just saying with the current coe  best to buy high value 2nd hand car,btohqsg
Imagine buying a 120k new car with arf of say 25-30kCompare to a old car with 5-6years to go and arf of 80k also costing 120k.Monthly will be similar  maybe old car a bit more (1 2 year less) but you get back more at the end. And you get more comfort driving.Then theres the old car  maintenance issues  etc.....,btohqsg
there are still a few undervalued cars in the market,btohqsg
good time to sell and buy those cars,btohqsg
when all this big germans go to 4 pot,btohqsg
this guys will rise in value,btohqsg
STI will rise because now subie not making,btohqsg
Got mid range undervalued car anot,btohqsg
cars like clio rs  megane rs,btohqsg
all this car are niche but will forever have demand because supply is low,btohqsg
I define cars by arf value,btohqsg
Mid to me will be around 80k arf,btohqsg
that one ex liao no meh,btohqsg
some coe cars can maintain its value very well,btohqsg
I mean there's 100k and above,btohqsg
so what kind of cars you talking abt,btohqsg
Sold my 15 year old car for 39kBgouht a 5 year old car at 120k with arf of 85k.,btohqsg
No those actually have slightly lower arf and higher depreciation,btohqsg
Anyway it's just my view on the current situation. Others can have their own views on what's best,btohqsg
Last time 120k can buy boxster S,btohqsg
boxster S is now 180k min,btohqsg
Ya lah last time but last time I don't have 120k 😭,btohqsg
but u bought ur xf for 120k?,btohqsg
i tot last time u buy,btohqsg
Can buy HDB 3 RM 99yr Coe,btohqsg

If you are talking about brand new  Civic is more expensive because it is a 1.5-litre turbocharged car-R,btohqsg

This is a newer generation actually,btohqsg
that is different. that scam case victims are gullible buying something they have not seen. in this case  it is the second hand watch retail you go to buy pay and get it at discounts.,btohqsg
You never see the recent news?,btohqsg
If you read the whole story  I would understand why they trusted him,btohqsg
Wrong. I’m saying that you buy watches that are already available. You pay you get. Not when you place deposits. You understand?,btohqsg
You don’t give money and hope they sell you kind of scam,btohqsg
Both have true gearhead appeals in my simple opinion sir. Just slightly different ⚙️ sizings ☺️☺️,btohqsg
Either that or buy direct from rolex,btohqsg
Different purchase reasons? I notice enthusiast cars and impressing girls hardly come together too unless we are talking about exotics.  All enthusiast cars attract are… other enthusiasts (often male) and young car spotters 📸😛😛,btohqsg

Back to purchase reason mah. Like how people can daily their Elise 😊😊,btohqsg
haha but yaris the production run so limited so harder to get our hands on,btohqsg
“You do you” hahahahaa. I personally think I will prefer the proportions of the Corolla especially after seeing the Yaris irl,btohqsg
to each their own  looks will always be subjective,btohqsg
Not sure if you will fit in the back sir 😅,btohqsg
oh😂😂 i mean its a second/third car right,btohqsg
Eh eh the regular Yaris is a fam car for some hor,btohqsg
But yeah the GR then yeah,btohqsg
Min 2nd car although I can imagine it would be a fun daily,btohqsg

toyota is going in the right direction for their GR line... cant say so much for the rest of the cars,btohqsg
thats y buy cheap  definitely not daily car. its the 2nd or 3rd car,btohqsg
they can take my money even if it’s slow,btohqsg
Good luck with that sir  no dealer is willing to sell anything to you unless you can drive their billing up for now and purchase multiple watches and build a relationship,btohqsg
Because they know the resale value and the limited supply that Rolex has created under the pre tense of pandemic production cuts,btohqsg
World first GR Camry sighted on the road already leh! 😉,btohqsg
I'm not a watch collector lmao. That's alright. All i use is a samsung watch,btohqsg
The only way for a common person to buy these would be resellers and sites like chrono24  direct from Rolex can only get a few models that they got a lot of,btohqsg
But they won’t tell you they have a lot of those. They will say “OH there is a very long queue for that  but if you pay the PREMIUM over retail price  I can see what I can do for you”,btohqsg
Hahha me too! But now diving into market research around watches. Fun to see what the market trends are and see what the various watch makers are doing,btohqsg
But in Singapore  from what I've seen. Most authorized dealers will shoo you away if you suggest paying a premium. Instead they would urge you to purchase more watches from other brands they are the authorized dealers for as well,btohqsg
