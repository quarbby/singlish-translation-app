But most of them don‚Äôt even carry over to the real world lol,btohqsg
I've studied this in depth and I've come to one conclusion. It's not that they can't  they don't want because acting the way they do yields them more attention and they crave it.It does not matter if it's bad  it's still attention on them,btohqsg
if u wanna get hate comments then sure,btohqsg
