I haven say KIA IS BETTER THAN BMW. U did LOL,btohqsg
To have a mindset of a “downgrade” whenever you think about kia  is something you should throw away right now,btohqsg
Sure maybe in 2010 you’re right,btohqsg

korean car have surpass japanese car imo,btohqsg
I wud say for some reason around 2013 to 2015 their cars gotten much nicer looking and morw reliable,btohqsg
japanese sports cars still better though,btohqsg
