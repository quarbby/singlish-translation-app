Do you earn more than 120k,btohqsg
Which bank is best for free lounge? I see there are DBS.. HSBC.. OCBC.. Standard Chartered etc..,btohqsg
SCB esaver details updated on its website - it maintains 3.75% interest p.a. for incremental funds (compared to Jan ADB),btohqsg
90kAlso is it true if u deposit $10k-$30k  u'll get cc approved easily (read on hardwarezone forum)?,btohqsg
This rate is only applicable for the period 1 Feb to 31 March right for the fresh funds right?,btohqsg
Usually 2 - 4X of your income.Hmm getting 120K means there is no regulated limit,btohqsg
Guys  anyone participate in the uob lunar new saving promo? For the earmarking of fund,btohqsg
Will the earmarking of the fund selected still be entitled to the monthly interest from uob one account?,btohqsg
I guess annual income? Cause 2 of cc already hit 6x my monthly. Or should I request to decrease my limit from those? I usually take whatever bank gives me :),btohqsg
Except ocbc will be quite strict with credit limit even if above $120k,btohqsg
OCBC rejected me in August (10 years+ customer  monthly salary crediting) ðŸ˜‚Now I don't find their cc attractive,btohqsg
OCBC top tier card like VI? Voyage?Oh well,btohqsg
Should I ask my current cc to decrase my limit? I only utilize 3-4k maximum,btohqsg
Maybe:  especially if you don't use that cc much and are already on GIRO arrangement,btohqsg

FD rates dropped for this month compared to January 2023,btohqsg
Even if you are premier customer  they donâ€™t care,btohqsg
I read somewhere sometimes credit rating see the percentage of your utilisation vs the limit too. If you decrease your limit to 5k  and use 4k  that's 80% and some banks might see you as high risk. I don't know how true this is.Easy to decrease  hard to increase next time when you need it. Don't lower it too much.,btohqsg
If u have self control in spending then is here a need to apply lower limit?,btohqsg
