Ok can sleep Liao....kanna expose Liao...thinking what name to use,btohqsg
Maybe tmr got new character again.,btohqsg
Do not forget MT is going to have Eps of 20cts and above this year  and will still be highly profitable next year. Thereafter  nobody know how profit will be taper off or continue at high level. No matter what  it will not go back to single cents unless the company begin to loss money  or loss its focus.,btohqsg
It willNo catalyst for long term earningsAt best demand stabilises but it won't be pandemic level  profits precovid was only 390k in 2019 and 350 in 2018,btohqsg
Will SIA recover to pre covid earning? It will take time...World keep changing,btohqsg
üòÖ Long term is not 3 months...,btohqsg
For those skeptical of medical Ppe industry growth I will attach some links to industry analyst reports. Industry is projected to grow between 7 to 10 percent annually covid or no covid till 2027.If anyone has reports showing otherwise fell free to post. We all can learn. No opinions please without facts. None of us are experts in Ppe industry.https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://ww2.frost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/PPE-healthcare-infographic.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj04PrI-_TrAhXs6nMBHRTPBbQQFjAAegQIARAB&usg=AOvVaw3BixSXaxne6tPjcDg7LW9Vhttps://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/healthcare-personal-protective-equipment-market-poised-significant-growthhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/amp/personal-protective-equipment-ppe-market-102015,btohqsg
Forecasted 2024..so won't be anytime soon,btohqsg
Not very optimistic on SIA..Even before covid struck..SIA hardly see any profit growth when compared on a yoy basis..Also the rights issue has diluted the shareholdings by slightly over 2x with a 3 for 2 rights issue..when they finally get profitable  EPS and Dividend ratios would all be more than halved due to this dilution..In other words..They would need to make at least 2x more the net profit..For you to see the same EPS and dividends you use to get..Now..What is the likelihood of this?,btohqsg
It's a different story if SIA got a govt bailout in another form..But a rights issue is severely dilutive,btohqsg
Besides I personally am not very impressed with the management..for example..the amount of losses on fuel hedging is quite impressive..,btohqsg
SATS should have greater potential than SIA if you believe that Singapore would continue to remain an air hub,btohqsg
Besides they could venture into other businesses like local catering etc,btohqsg
Earning?I thought they losing money now,btohqsg
What I mean is..Even if they eventually start making$.. eps and dividend will remain v low due to dilution from rights,btohqsg
Maybe we should have blue chip stock discussion group ha2...,btohqsg
A few mths after rights n bonds issued  already half the money gone,btohqsg
They are really bad at spending,btohqsg
Let me steal 3mins from you,btohqsg
Who is fella sitting in the balcony of his condo and smoking a cigar?,btohqsg
Just that he talk very slow,btohqsg
Oh!  This stock has good potential as long as Covid-19 vaccine i still in progress. Good  base purely on fundamentals.,btohqsg
Hi  sis and bro  need ur advise. Are saxo also have contra t+2? Normally I use Dbsv. Thanks,btohqsg
Yes! If based purely on Fundamentally wise is good  but technical doesn‚Äôt reflect so... but now we know as said by donald trump  vaccine will be out only April  hope the share price will start to go up again,btohqsg
Bro Kit Whye Chan is good in FA. It's good to have him join the group. Newbies can learn from him.,btohqsg
Owned by Taiwanese and they are American citizens,btohqsg
Anyone use TD? Is it safe to deposit huge amount at 1 go? Like 200k?,btohqsg
Medtecs should achieve 15 cts USD EPS or 20 cts SGD for FY2020. At current share price (S$1.07)  I think it is cheap with PE at 5.4.  The uncertainty is whether the company is generous to increase its dividend payout next year.,btohqsg
MT possible give bonus issue and partly dividend instead of fully dividend ?,btohqsg
Anything is possible. Its free float is more than 90% and share outstanding close to 550 million. Its executive team don‚Äôt hold much of the shares.  In this case  higher dividend payout may also be possible.,btohqsg
Yes cheers. Good to have him here,btohqsg
Likely oppositeIf management don‚Äôt hold much shares then probably no incentive to give higher dividend. Clement is controlling but not much too,btohqsg
If I am management and have not much stake and hence no incentive to give back to shareholders (generally speaking not referring to Mt)I will keep as much cash as possible then do diversification etc.My remuneration is based on performance of company. I taking risk unnecessarily and if bets pay off I get rewarded. If not then too bad I don‚Äôt lose anything. Sad for shareholders,btohqsg
Depends on whether MT has a dividend policy,btohqsg
Agree...not in the best interests of mgmt if they do not own so many shares themselves. They are just working executives with some shares,btohqsg
Gambling with shareholder $ in a way,btohqsg
They are not heavily vested in MT and no need to sell off their meagre holdings. Quite surprised that the free float is 90%.,btohqsg
the purchase of shares by director‚Äôs wife is a positive indication of confidence,btohqsg
For a mere $23.5k or something? That is pittance  imo. She just have 1 less Hermes bag...lol,btohqsg
Could it be Taiwanese also manipulating so Low that the wife standby to buy ?,btohqsg
Buy...also must buy by the millions to show solid support mah.$23k thereabouts in whatever currency investment in a counter - am sure our investors here invest more than this amt!!,btohqsg
See TG - when price collapsed  coy pumped in funds to prop up the TG price üëç Solid  man,btohqsg
I think she also dunno how to read market - got excess $$ just buy and declare. Now come out - blue black,btohqsg
think it is 10k at 1.50  10k at 1.35 so $28500 not $23500. can confirm?,btohqsg
Very true. It is a dilemma. Its NAV per share is so low. Without enticing shareholders with good dividend  very difficult for the shares to move higher unless big fund start to take notice  and more analysts come in with buy calls.,btohqsg
Exact details - not sure...but I know...not many zeros after the last digit  5,btohqsg
"The so-called ""disadvantage"" of a company with a large free float is that there is no strong major shareholders and is just run by highly paid executives. Correct me  if I am wrong...this is just my opinion.If I am an institutional investor  I also want to look at major shareholders commitment - like TG.",btohqsg
MT Projected sales for Q3 and Q4 based on max capacity and prices.,btohqsg
So FY EPS will be > 15 US cent.  Unfortunately MT is listed in Catalist. Should migrate to Main Board.,btohqsg
So the retailer must charge $us$2 per piece maybe,btohqsg
Almost $2 a piece1 box $100At peak here also $50-60,btohqsg
Now not peak Liao. I buy a box if face mask about $25.. and this is consider higher price range .,btohqsg
Pls check European/US/Phil price. Not SG. See where their major market.,btohqsg
Using this now. One box $22.50. My frens say very exp.,btohqsg
Like this china even cheaper right. Why so many mask co still collapse,btohqsg
Dunno who will pay for such price. China is literally world mask producer. Producing so much till newbie manufacturer closing,btohqsg
Someone just plagiarised what you said... he so low low. üòÖ,btohqsg
Yeap. To me comfort very important. So I use this brand.,btohqsg
Yes many new mask factory in china close shop,btohqsg
MT EPS should be more than 27 cents for the year. Q1 did not contribute much. Q2 is more reprenrarive of how Q3 and q4 will be. Q2 EPS is 9 cents sgd. So total year should be close to 30 cents and that too assuming no further growth. As per their guidance it should be better in Q3 and q4.,btohqsg
Indonesian brand.  It‚Äôs. Expensive.  Now legit mask   u can get $9,btohqsg
Its whether it is really protecting u that matters. Whether it blocks the vapors. How hot & difficult also i wear.,btohqsg
I ever bought . But the mask too thick le. Or too small.  Cannot breath well. Sg too hot,btohqsg
Wa I cannot take it. Sg very very hot . Lol. So no choice pay more for comfort la,btohqsg
Yes. Anyway  that guy with identity issue was kicked and banned from here. Though many of us suspect he is still lurking here with other user names,btohqsg
yup certain mask...when u breathe in  the front part cover nosetrils  cannot breathe,btohqsg
Lai lai should i go expose him?,btohqsg
Omg that guy is so disgusting,btohqsg
Probably he is here lurking. But cannot voice out,btohqsg
Ok. Then I don‚Äôt know who. I never follow all the chats ... too many to read . I only read as and when I happen to be in lol,btohqsg
Heng ah post 30mins before him if not become I copy him,btohqsg
Haha... he Admin owner in that huat group. He BB  we are SB.,btohqsg
I am not interested in that group chat so doesnt matter for me,btohqsg
Screenshot taken so we know he is one small coward,btohqsg
He big  we small. Just  like in market  small lose to big,btohqsg
His words take with a pinch of salt lah.,btohqsg
Anyway just another egoistic guy in the market that plagiarise but cannot take any comments.,btohqsg
Ok guys enjoy your sunday üôè hope everything is good and well before we fight again tmr. Cheers,btohqsg

I cud be wrong but Aspen is risky as they sign MOU to build gloves factories.Any factories has at least 5 to 10 % defects rate  those factories can go bankrupt.U can read about The two rubber factories namely Southlamd and Von Bundit,btohqsg

MT float is 450 million shares as per yahoo finance. Average volume traded 40+ million last 3 months. 20% held by insiders. Clement owns 7.14 percent as per latest Annual report (courtesy another brother in MT chat group).,btohqsg
His final posts before he got banned were posting photos that got him banned... those photos were of course removed by admin already. He didn't leave after saying he was going to. Anyway  that's history.,btohqsg
And his so call group if you scan the members. Many clones. And he has no substance. Whats the point of following. So i left.,btohqsg
It was on a saturday afternoon. It happened within minutes. I think you probably were not online when it happened.,btohqsg
Lets move on.. The more you defend.. The more it looks suspicious,btohqsg
Abdulloare you like another smurf account from him?,btohqsg
You defending him vs 10+ of us that saw it,btohqsg
Seems like him  trying to justify him,btohqsg

He came back with another account,btohqsg
Not just 1 but many pics,btohqsg
Alright stop trying to defend him,btohqsg

He talk sense I think like previous us president election also affected,btohqsg
Ty yap or something.  Can see his vid on fb,btohqsg
TG settlement of us ban seems to be progressing well,btohqsg
hopeful that come monday MT can go up and start the lift for all health coscause the situation is not as rosy as our govt is saying. global resurgence of covid is accelerating,btohqsg
I think previous us president election impact global stock exchange,btohqsg
i can feel you.a lot of self egoistic people but noisy only when people like us share or warn.but for the betterment of new investors you are doing real good,btohqsg
Some msia trainer. Seen his vids sometimes,btohqsg
Thx for encouragement. Motivation to carry on,btohqsg
no problemjust ignore the noisesi warned about somethings earlier and it came true also.which was why i said earlier why got people so good heart come out scold you.,btohqsg
regarding any telegroup do note this.some people have agenda.to have a 4k member group gives you income if you throw advertisements,btohqsg
so the logic is  if it is free.you are probably the product,btohqsg
this group still good cause no ads so far. good job maintaining neutral,btohqsg
dun know if vic made any profit,btohqsg
if not wrong furion and ed c talked some logic about vicplus,btohqsg
scroll up and see for yourself,btohqsg
wont be solid like gloves n mt,btohqsg
Historically   stock went up regardless rep or demo win.,btohqsg
but if DT continue ... he may cause chaos,btohqsg
Yup is right is only impact on but like he say regardless of who win . Need gloves means still de regardless of who win . Just that volatile during election period,btohqsg
No need glove means no need,btohqsg

see what furion and ed c typed,btohqsg
you can continue spreading good feels. it's good too,btohqsg
Nasel swab and test kits and ppe,btohqsg

i can save 100k at least leh,btohqsg
Your paper loss in Mt $100k?,btohqsg
Not with vics only same.applies other counter,btohqsg
Perhaps u should start to research more,btohqsg
Refer to video and search why impact etc,btohqsg

Probably Google can tell u the answer,btohqsg
hope you lose big big so can learn that lesson =),btohqsg
And please see past history on how us election in particular Donald  impact global stock exchange,btohqsg
Ok la. My loss also more than $100k. Not in medtec,btohqsg

Unfortunately  the deal did not go through likely due to a untimely murder of one the the SSH which probably deterred the buyer (‚Äòrumoured to be COSCO‚Äô which bought Cogent instead)After the scandal  price dropped gradually over time.2) In 2019  GKE placed out 100 million new shares at $0.070 to 3 Chinese investors (2 of them were working in the firm in some capacity  while another 1 was related to the director/chairman)Thing to note is that they are likely to be still holding on to the shares as 2 of them are SSH and no announcements made thus far.Conclusion:With recent shift of more businesses going from retail to online  this will benefit the Warehousing & logistic businesses significantly . GKE is an integrated company which have capability and infrastructure to support most logistical requirements.What i like about GKE is that they have turned around in FY20 and went into the green from 3 years of losses at a time where businesses are affected by Covid19. This shows that they have positioned their business well to handle can still perform in tougher periods.Also  I would assume that anyone who have tried to sell their business once would have intention to sell the company again. With their Chinese connection  they might look for buyers and with their better and current financials  it would make them a more ideal target for bigger Chinese logistical giants.In addition  2 of the recent Chinese who  are involved in the business in some capacity  took the $0.070 placement in 2019 and have not sold off their stake which is quite re-assuring as they could have netted over a million dollars but they stayed put. Perhaps they might have some insights on GKE business that we might not know.Hence  high probability that they would finally force the breakout pass $0.081 convincing and test the year high of $0.090.,btohqsg

Exactly. Moreover technology  knowledge  manpower and raw materials all available in Malaysia. Aspen is building factory next to Top Glove factories in same industrial area. Glove demand is projected shortage 2 to 3 years atlest.,btohqsg

late comers to the glove industry will inevitably have some catching up to do. Most imptly must choose JV partner carefully  one which can add value such as having good contacts and reputation  ability to source for low-cost good labour in the foreign country...etc. Margins are so impt and burn-rate before the first $ of revenue comes in,btohqsg
Not hot air as many would like you to believe. They are in a advanced stage. Production slated to start by 2021 2nd quarter. This link has more info. At 17 cents not bad for medium term. Once factory is up price will look up as well.They are recruiting a MD with 20 years experience in glove industry.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/aspen-to-build-factory-for-new-glove-business-names-md-for-unit%3famp,btohqsg
U forward can see the source got acknowledgement not plagiarizing,btohqsg
Anyway..just share share. Does this mean support @1.02? What is cloud 95? I only know cloud 9,btohqsg
High risk high return. 6 months later to start production. 9-12 months to see it appear in bottomlineProbably more candidates more proven to be vestedThe hot air could potentially give best returns as hot air rises. When bubble burst also more painful,btohqsg
How and wat is spam? Lol. I sua ku,btohqsg
From what master Yuan wrote  I deduce that he says MT u-turn up at 1.02....and got ichimoku cloud support at 95? Correct me if I am wrong. TA newbie here,btohqsg

Sorry I no understand the chartsIs the chart indicate good or bad for medtecAny advise please,btohqsg
Not say good or bad... just a guide on where the price may possibly go.@1.02 - likely to u-turn to go up....this means based on last fri closing px of 1.07  may go down slightly to 1.02 before going up..95 - is supposedly the support.This is how I read it. Any other views?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs unclear at this point. Need to watch a few more sessions.Generally  1.02 looks good support  if break down  look out for 0.99.0.95 is quite critical,btohqsg
May not all happen in 1 day trade....just have to be mindful of the diff levels of support,btohqsg
does that low of 1.02 on Fri count as hit already? thanks,btohqsg
yes then the bounce before close,btohqsg
Got to observe closely already.If you holding at high price then don't matter but if you wish to enter better wait out,btohqsg

Cuz they don't get support from government or any government linked companies?Aspen getting fast tracked approval to set up the glove facility and they will also receive support. Yea they are new to glove production  but glove will still stick around 2021 or even 2022  and the demand will still be higher than in the past cuz medical sector and countries will want to stock a bit on it.Today is ground piling day for Aspen! Hope its a bull Market for all counters! Huat ah!,btohqsg
