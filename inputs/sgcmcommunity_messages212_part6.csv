Hi all Can check does all 2nd hand car dealers strictly accept 30% dp to be eligible for bank loan ? If dp 20% can ?Thanks,btohqsg
Full loan also can  they happiest 🤭,btohqsg
You mean can 0dp to apply for bank loan ? I don’t wish to take up inhouse loan. I thought most dealer minimally require 30% dp to apply for bank loan.,btohqsg
The more you loan the happier they are,btohqsg
They will mark up the price on paper to secure higher loan,btohqsg
Therefore you monthly will be higher and interest will be more,btohqsg
Can la  just mark up the car price,btohqsg
Nah still a lot of 2nd hand dealerships do it,btohqsg
Anyway  I just wanna check also. In house loan isit equals to legal money lender ?I don’t wish to get in house cause of the nature of work I am in.,btohqsg
Won't fail audit if there's no audit,btohqsg
Meaning they are not categorise as legal money lender under the MinLaw website ?,btohqsg
Just eat grass for a few months you will have enough to pay the extra 10%,btohqsg
