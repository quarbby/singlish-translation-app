Shit based on own experience one thing,btohqsg
I mean as long as they keep for their personal use sure  but I don’t get why she wants,btohqsg
If they leak online I may get into trouble if caught tho,btohqsg
Also another year would be 2018 the question on the cross island line,btohqsg
That one stumped a lot of ppl,btohqsg
yep  u shit based on what other ppl say is another thing.,btohqsg
I love maths and I want to stretch myself. I want to expand my maths knowledge and play with numbers so I can make more Math songs and poems. And most of all  I want to use these numbers to make movies and music or just for the fun of it and to inspire other girls to love Maths. The gender gap in STEM is disproportionately skewed towards guys so I want to shine that light and open the door for girls and women everywhere,btohqsg
So they tested solely chp 2?,btohqsg
Sry for my blunder again that day btw,btohqsg
tbf she does shit on her own sch,btohqsg
Nah some of the essay qns can test a range of chapters. For RDM concepts from other chapters may be involved,btohqsg
but not as much as the rest,btohqsg
The RDM framework is inside the syllabus doc,btohqsg
it could be blind leading the blind,btohqsg
I thought it’s sth good so that they’re forced to rmbr what a proper essay is like,btohqsg
Personally I think it would be better if they did it with other schs,btohqsg
I can pm you my tuition centre’s TYS answers for some particular qns if you want  but your sch should also release theirs closer to As,btohqsg
rather than self mark their own work within their own sch,btohqsg
cuz ur just rehasing what ur teaching,btohqsg
it can be a limit for improvement tbf,btohqsg
Also the rae person went inactive,btohqsg
Its why i like reading what other students write,btohqsg
Actually moe should make it compulsory then,btohqsg
cuz ik how other schs teach their essay structure and ik what they kinda look for,btohqsg
it doesnt rly actively improve the quality of teaching,btohqsg
and some schs already do that,btohqsg
so theres no point for moe to step in,btohqsg
"within geog at least theres a few ""alliances""",btohqsg
then theyll share notes  resources etc.,btohqsg
so these schs tend to perform similarly,btohqsg
At least I think through this exercise it would be an opportunity for chers from different schs to exchange feedback and share good practices,btohqsg
i cant say which ones here,btohqsg
ya its q normal practice alr,btohqsg
Ik for a fact geog have,btohqsg
GP wise I think also have,btohqsg
Yall i feel like a expensive cpu that has high maintenance and a shit cooling system rn,btohqsg
He can't say here I think,btohqsg
this the only one I can say,btohqsg
all schs literally teach the same content and use almost similar notes,btohqsg
I was half expecting ac to be inside,btohqsg
Cause im literally overheating rn in a aircon gym,btohqsg
unfortunately it was like half her personality,btohqsg
Ngl i feel like beating my classmate up,btohqsg
and im trying to cool down rn by being under a fan,btohqsg
but Benjamin Goh is batchmates with the NJC ex Geog Deputy head and the Ex EJC geog deputy head,btohqsg
susan meow is just waiting to retire so idt she cba,btohqsg
I wish the one who got cross deployed to a Pri sch didn’t leave,btohqsg
Might actually faint its damn hot for me,btohqsg
She very aunty like but she’s quite decent,btohqsg
If i ever get time ill backread,btohqsg
