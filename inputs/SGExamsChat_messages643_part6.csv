goddam ri 2013 was cop was a 3,btohqsg
The first 3 years (2017-2019) they were at the former RJC campus holding site since the new campus couldn’t be completed on time. In 2018 moe made all schools increase the intake  so ejc cop was the highest then  with science rising by 1 point and arts by 2 points. Both streams decreased by one point in 2019 as was the case with most other JCs that year when I assume the intake per sch shrank. But in 2020  the new campus was ready and both streams fell by 2 points each. Then ejc has just been getting more popular since then  and both streams fell by 1 compared to 2020.,btohqsg
The new campus is the main factor I guess,btohqsg
