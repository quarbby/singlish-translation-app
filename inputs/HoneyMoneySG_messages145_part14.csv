PSA / Warning on Amaze's latest OTP changeWith the latest change in Amaze's online transaction authorisation method (from SMS / email OTP) to in-app authorisation  it actually means if a hacker knows your Amaze Login and Amaze Password  he can do EVERYTHING:1. change your password2. see your amaze card details  including CVV (when he originally didn't know)3. switch between linked cards (even though u set to empty wallet for safety)4. APPROVE online transactionsThis is clearly a security flaw to me as there is no longer any second level security measure protecting you.I have highlighted this to Amaze Instarem as a major security flaw but if one person says so  they may not bother.I urge more of you to feedback this major issue to Amaze via live chat if you are a worried user like me.P.S. this concern is real. There is already at least one genuine hack encountered by a reliable chat friend that prompted me to contact Amaze. That chat friend's family member Instarem Account got hacked and fraudulent transactions could immediately be approved since the hacker has FULL ACCESS to your Instarem Account and able to approve online transactions by just knowing your login and password.,btohqsg
Login to Amaze got no 2FA right?,btohqsg
don't have.. that's the problem... there is no more security checks after login/password stage...,btohqsg
For Banks  before the phone can be used to approve any transactions  the phone has to be 'binded' and now they impose a 12 hour cooldown.Amaze.. nothing.,btohqsg

Hi  anyone knows any good place to park 50k and to maximize returns?,btohqsg
If your spending of $1000 or more is spent 2- 3 days before your statement date  either you hope that they cleared and posted before your statement date or you call them to expedite the process.,btohqsg
