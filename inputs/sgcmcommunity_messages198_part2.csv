1.8 ? Fuel economy quite bad .. My only get 11km/L,btohqsg
11km for mpv is not so bad,btohqsg
Around 8 years plus now.. first few years can get 15-16km/L. Fuel econ get bad when car getting old. Not planning to renew COE.,btohqsg
Wish is good size mpv in my opinion,btohqsg
But quite reliable.. my around 180 k km .. still running .. only change spark plug/ ignition coil/ brake pad/brake rotor/ engine mount/ back suspension/starter motor 2nd hand during the 8 years+ . Only few hundred per items.,btohqsg
Fetch 7 normal size people no problem .. I use it to carry heavy load items. That why mine back suspension and rotor spoil faster.,btohqsg
But if u want a 7 seater then Wish,btohqsg
But remember to water ur wallet daily,btohqsg
