haha. I think Japanese / Korean system of language is now being simplified with their own characters only hardly remaining any Chinese characters. haha,btohqsg
Pretty sure they need to take an Additional language class like Spanish in high school or other mother tongue,btohqsg
but then there's no standardize test for that?,btohqsg
unless they sit for the A.P. course in school,btohqsg
In China gaokao   students can take 1 foreign language   counted in grades,btohqsg
anyhow being multilingual is kinda hard growing up. üòÇit always a bad mix-match between language until some weird hybrid comes out,btohqsg
Dun worry  you are not alone  learn multi languages is like fun too. Gets more entertainment options online,btohqsg
Like can use more diverse app and understand more content,btohqsg
do you guys got any advice for retaking O's as a priv candidate,btohqsg
And see what's your goal from that exam,btohqsg
If it's to improve your score then see which subj from prev try you scored badly but have the most confidence to score higher.,btohqsg
math pure bio combi chem/phy poa eng,btohqsg
i also tried DAE but hopes not high cause fail math and im pr,btohqsg
My advice is do tys to determine what went wrong with your previous attempt first üòÖüòÖ and review answers key for problems as well,btohqsg
Since is a retake  you dw repeat mistakes again,btohqsg
Sorry for O Level Elitism news but ....,btohqsg
life is better when one blocks mothership,btohqsg

halloo ! anyone have any robotics class recommendations for outside sch ? i wna start doing it outside as a hobby :) ( i do python on the side if that helps ‚≠ê ),btohqsg
last time was like Lego Mindstorms so basic stuffs.,btohqsg
if you want to go for the Engineering Route.That would be Arduinos / Raspberry Pis.,btohqsg
Raspberry Pi supports Python? If I recall correctly.,btohqsg
Arduino ones normally you just mod people's code.,btohqsg
Huh..now still have ppl use raspberry pi?,btohqsg
naw i just wna do it on the side üòì,btohqsg
my main focus is coding games etc,btohqsg
But the game sector is almost like dying,btohqsg
I left engineering school in 2020. don't tell me they already phased out Raspberry pi . lel.,btohqsg
Still have use.. just that not much usage,btohqsg
2016-2020 really a pocket burn for most Engineering students. From buying 3D printers to Arduino/Raspberry Pi projects. lol.,btohqsg
Game sector don't even pay 3k for degree holders,btohqsg
just do CS. And jump upto a start up in SG...,btohqsg
just do math + csthen go quant/jokes,btohqsg
Dont do Engineering either... especially in Tech / Semiconductors...,btohqsg
The startup in sg is almost like closing,btohqsg
But game development ppl can be app developer ?,btohqsg
idk bout you  it's not the perfect - metal rice bowl job anymore.,btohqsg
You guys sure or not..even with A1 in the game chart,btohqsg
also the learning curve in Semiconductor Design ...,btohqsg
With the leading for 3 days in appstore,btohqsg
please end up in NTU EEE plz.,btohqsg
