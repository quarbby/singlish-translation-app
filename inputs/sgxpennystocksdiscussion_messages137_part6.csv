Rubber futures extended losses in the second week of November to trade below 235 yen per Kg  after reaching an over 3-year high of 308 yen on October 30th  as new lockdowns and restrictions in Europe to curb the spread of the Covid-19 are expected to hit the automobile sector. The latest figures showed car sales fell in Europe‚Äôs four largest markets in October. Also  Japanese manufacturers and service-sector firms believe conditions will remain negative over the coming months  according to the monthly Reuters Tankan Index. Still  strong demand from China‚Äôs top consumer and glove manufacturers and lower supply is likely to support prices. The Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries expects a nearly 5% fall in global production  with output hit by coronavirus-related labor shortages as well as floods and unfavorable weather in Thailand and Vietnam.,btohqsg
