https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/retirement-income/retirement-withdrawals/how-is-the-withdrawable-amount-computedI have some questions for 20% RA withdrawal at 651. is this a special scenario for those who doesn’t want to utilise CPF LIFE?2. since RA for most people is just FRS+interest   how does someone have more RA than FRS or even ERS3. Is there a scenario where withdrawing the 20% is better than utilising CPF LIFE ?,btohqsg
There is actually another chat where there is a bird who is expert on CPF rules.,btohqsg
anyone here know about investing on S&P500?,btohqsg
yea i also kena. lucky its just for lunch i think $25 or so,btohqsg
hi master  is there any way i can add my uob cc to my apple pay without receiving my cc physical card yet?,btohqsg
1. Not special scenario. If you don't want CPF Life  you can purchase an annuity plan that may have worser payouts for the same premium (this may change in the future)2. Top-up and mandatory contributions3. You have usage of the monies with some sacrifices to payouts,btohqsg
Last I recall no  only Google Pay can,btohqsg
I am curious also... dont u need the cvc?,btohqsg
Adding cc to google pay and using googlepay,btohqsg
Uh just add through UOB TMRW? That's all you need to do,btohqsg
Oh wow. Thank you! Didnt know this could be done. Cool!👍👍👍,btohqsg
Hi  was doing some research was thinking of applying for a credit card. As a student what would be the best card with no minimum spend for cash back and miles,btohqsg
credit card will need income though,btohqsg
Same for me. Meal at Din Tai Fung at Taipei 101 was classified as shopping. 😩,btohqsg
1. No  u can do the withdrawal and still have CPF Life.2. The theoretical max is to transfer/top up to ERS once your RA is formed at 55 years old and let it compound (including mandatory contributions) from there.3. The 20% withdrawal gives u a lump sum liquidity  at the expense of lower CPF Life payouts subsequently; whether that is beneficial or not depends on individual circumstances. E.g. if u have occasional unplanned big spending  doing the 20% withdrawal may make sense as it allows u to have enough spare cash to fund those spending as and when they arise.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if ocbc infinity card gives cashback for SimplyGo?,btohqsg
VOO or CSPX depending on preference and which exchange you have access,btohqsg
i understand amaze converts offline to online transactionbut what if i want to make a foreign currency online transactioncan i use amaze to still earn miles and their exchange rate?,btohqsg
Yes  u can. It will be charged as a SGD online transaction to the linked card  with the MCC of the original foreign currency transaction. U will earn the linked card rewards assuming the MCC is eligible.,btohqsg
Do a $500/month savings plan and done haha that’s what I did 🤣,btohqsg
Anyone has any good way of improving personal tax reliefs? Max is 80k. Got any other way to get more tax reliefs?,btohqsg
Hi users of ocbc360  may I ask if your website version shows the credit card spending criteria tracker on your 360 deposit account page? Mine only show salary  save  and increment  these 3 only,btohqsg
"He ask for more tax ""relief""  but this solution is more taxing on the mental.. 😂",btohqsg
I have 2 joint ocbc accounts with my wife  with each of us as the primary to each account.But somehow my credit card (my name) spend last month was actually paid interest calculated with the joint acct which is primary with my wife's name..Anyone knows how to change the link? And done it before?,btohqsg
CPF and SRS top-ups.. and like what Mt said  contribute to SG fertility rates,btohqsg
The credit card is your primary account's main card or your wife's primary account supp card?,btohqsg
Saving plan for how many years? When can terminate n withdraw without loss?,btohqsg
Anybody emptying UOB one account today?If yes  do we need to leave at least a minimum amount? What is the minimum amount?,btohqsg
If u have min income  get UOB Ppv for everyday spend. And since student get another one that can pay for your tuition fee. Card option depends on ur income,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSGI followed your guide for IBKR transfer in to Webull  where to find the security transfer fee statement in IBKR? I searched a few statements but can't find  it can't be free right?,btohqsg
No transfer fees from IBKR to webull  free,btohqsg
For individual income tax relief  can look at herehttps://youtu.be/7PbY2gJlzyg?si=1gl7UbWLjtP3d73POtherwise  start a business,btohqsg
Wow  nice. IBKR is such a nice broker.,btohqsg
After 10 yrs what's the EIR p.a.?,btohqsg
No news on new quarterly promo?...,btohqsg
They usually will announced much later days or weeks after the date of criteria. That is why you are taking a chance if they will roll out the promo. You earn a lump sum if you do. If not  you lose a few days of interest.,btohqsg
Hello  morning everyoneDoes anyone have a copy or link for the SC Simply Credit Card exclusion list ?I’m trying to find it online but not able to locate at all..Please help  appreciate itJust want to know if paying hospital bills is excluded too..,btohqsg
"Usually they will announce on the first day of promo  which is after date to ""withdraw""",btohqsg
You can Google for standard chartered simply credit card t&c,btohqsg
Depends on risk appetite  if you want guaranteed returns then it’s about 3-4% P.A  for mine I put in investments giving about 6-13% returns P.A,btohqsg
I tried. I found this link only,btohqsg

Hi Chris  according to the Singsaver's T&Cs for the travel insurance promo  it seems to say 2mpd reward. did it get reduced?,btohqsg
2 sets of t&cs. each earning 2 mpd  can refer to the post here at the bottom. I was confused too and clarified with SingSaverhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/182431,btohqsg
if i have more cards with UOB  i would priortise UOB cards first like me so i would go for 2 then 5 then 1,btohqsg
The only other uob card I have is the amex card and uob one,btohqsg
