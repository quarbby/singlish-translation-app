Anyway no point to appeal / argue,btohqsg
Unless you‚Äôre dam confident it wasn‚Äôt that fast,btohqsg
Because even if they got the speed wrong,btohqsg
It won‚Äôt be 50km/h over limit wrong,btohqsg
Im confident ah but kinda lazy to go purposely stir shit,btohqsg
No matter what you were likely speeding,btohqsg
They catch based on road limit iicrc,btohqsg
Prepare ang pao to LTA and tp,btohqsg
So if you appeal and they notice based on vehicular limit,btohqsg
I heard got 10 kmh grace tho  not sure,btohqsg
So 70 for light good vehicle.,btohqsg
So means you were probably 110-120,btohqsg
Not sure true or not ah,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong they will tell you the exact speed you were caught for,btohqsg
I dont rmb doing so but 90 maybe ya,btohqsg
I was looking for it but dont have,btohqsg
Lolol anyway you‚Äôre better off just paying it and move on,btohqsg
Anyway the faster the demerit points come,btohqsg
The faster you get to start your 1 year obedience course,btohqsg
No la I‚Äôm just joking but,btohqsg
You‚Äôll probably not want to get any demerit points cause,btohqsg
You need 1 year clean slate,btohqsg
So normally after first offence you‚Äôll be law abiding,btohqsg
Next time 70 follow unless u japan that GTR HIACE,btohqsg
