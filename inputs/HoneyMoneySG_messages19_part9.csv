Posting my topic once more...

My vendor has only provided paynow uen and bank account.Any good smart ideas are greatly appreciated!,btohqsg
Got 1 approved Liao havenâ€™t delivered. ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
If you are planning to convert dbs points to miles then probably not worth it. Miles are generally valued higher than the amount you can offset in cash. Unless you need to use up the dbs points before they expire soon and there is not enough to convert to miles (min amount is 5000 dbs points to convert to 10000 miles).,btohqsg
You can either use UOB Absolute > Grab then use Grab to pay  or use a card that gives rewards for using CardUp or IPayMy,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think grab can work  unless they have a qr code yes?,btohqsg
