Idk man. Just asking for public opinion üòÖ might be anybody fault la. But sometimes i feel buses are abit self entitled on the roadüòÖ,btohqsg
The bigger the feller  all the more you give way,btohqsg
I agree uh. Smaller vehicle sure have losing end.,btohqsg
But that's why I see cyclist and I'm like  these fellers got death wish,btohqsg
They just need a driver to be in the wrong state of mind  and that's it,btohqsg
He disagrees with your judgement call to squeeze through,btohqsg
But in the event there was any collision u would have lost 100% based on video,btohqsg
Yes because the bus did not encroach as u were passing  he was already partially in the lane due to road conditions and u proceeded,btohqsg
Best option to me would have been slow down move to right lane then overtake the bus,btohqsg
If the situation had mirror and overtake on right  still at fault because the safe decision would be not to attempt to pass,btohqsg

Stationary no noise  only turning make noises,btohqsg

Yes sir. That is correct. I need to be more explicit with my question cause I realise not many here would understand üòÖ,btohqsg
Sounds like wheels issue.Something rubbing at a certain position.,btohqsg
I guess is brake pads or wheel bearings.,btohqsg
Sounds like brake pad/rotor contact  or bearing,btohqsg
