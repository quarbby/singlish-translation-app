Acrometa rights XR on the 28th Dec 2022(Last Friday’s Market Depth and Time & Sales for reference )(Note: entitled to subscribe for the 1-1 $0.02 must hold until 28th Dec to be eligible to subscribe.)This means tomorrow  27th Dec 22 is to be the last day for anyone who wants to get $0.020 rights shares to buy.Hence  we might expect some buying frenzy here  as shown from Friday  buyers already started to come in with a later buyer coming in to Scoop $0.046 and $0.047 in a biteGood luck holders.IMO 2023 should be a good year for Acrometa due to their-(1) business growth and turnaround - top and bottom line increased -(2) improving maintenance business and- (3) Waste to energy business that they are building.My view is Acrometa ($0.047) should be an easy double bag counter in 2023. Put here first for easy reference in future.those who can hold can consider this counter. Might just be a dark horse 🐎,btohqsg

those recent bought 44-45 will be tempted to earn 5-6 pips at 0.050,btohqsg
there is no Q all the way up to $0.060. interesting to see whether any big BBs will hop on to Acrometa and set up games soon for the rights play,btohqsg
the PA for acrometa very nice today. I encourage BBs to watch this one closely going to 2023.Acrometa big play will be their renewable energy  Waste-to-energy business. It will be the stronger theme play amongst few businesses,btohqsg

"🥃Pika World Morgan Stanley Podcast Insight📊📖Topic: What indicator(s) helps determine the market's trend?🔦The recent debate on the use of yield curve vs labour market has teased out the common question investors  or traders have: How do we select the best economic data indicator to better shape our projection of the equity market?In the recent podcast  Morgan Stanley's team helped craft a thinking path. One useful forward indicator discussed is the yield curve  which is the difference between short-term and long-term borrowing costs. They tend to move the market even before any price-in impacts by investors.🧑‍🎓Job data and its lag time🧮On the other spectrum  job data is the key highlight and should be seen as necessary since wages and jobs are vital components to the economy's health. Therefore  it might seem odd if they are classified as less important than the yield curve.A deeper dive into the reasoning might reveal some intriguing points of view. As the economy starts to weaken  employers may resist retrenchment for as long as possible since firing workers can be costly and disruptive to business operations. Therefore  the labour market may respond with a more significant lag time than when there is a slowdown.On the flip side  as the economy comes out of recession  employers may hold off hiring as the confidence level is often at the lowest end. With a dose of hindsight  some market strategists may sell stocks when the labour market is most robust and accumulate when the job market is at the trough.💰Wage-related inflation catalyst🎲But what about wages? That's undoubtedly a concern since wage-pull inflation is now the hot topic in town. High wage inflation is forcing the Fed to keep increasing interest rates and hurting equity valuation. Let's use history as a guide.In 2001  2007 and 2019  when wage growth was at its peak  it coincided with the onset of the Fed cutting back interest rates. In those times  when wage growth reached its highest point  others parts of the economy were already showing cracks back then  motivating a looser monetary policy.As such  among all the rebates  consistently with our reading and listening to various materials  Pika World still believes the yield curve is still primarily a firmer indicator of market trajectory. Nonetheless  we are not offsetting the ""impact"" of job data since it is the Fed's primary concern to see it weaken.With that  we hope you have a profitable trading week ahead. If you are still festive  Pika World wishes you a happy holiday!",btohqsg

WTI Crude Oily🛢️ futures rose above $80 per barrel in holiday-thinned trade on Tuesday  as China reversed Covid restrictions further whilewinter❄️🥶 storms🌪 across the US disrupted oil flows.China announced on Monday that it will end quarantine requirements for inbound travelers starting on Jan. 8  lifting the demand outlook in the world’s top crude importer. On the supply side  more than a third of Texas Gulf refining capacity was shut over the past few days due to winter storms  as reported by Bloomberg. The prospect of a production cut by Russia also supported oil prices  as the country may reduce output by 5% to 7% in early 2023 in response to price caps imposed by Western nations,btohqsg

it depends on the price then.  i have the rights which i can trade too. if they pump this one. then rights shares also will up together.,btohqsg
