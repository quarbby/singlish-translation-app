SIA:  Today  SIA trade ex-dividend 10 cents  which see it drop 16 cents this morning.It is a sell as no more dividend will be announced for next six months.One lesson we must learn is that we should never believe that ex-dividend share price will be better. The 16 cents drop this morning is higher than the 10 cents dividend. Isn't it better off if a small SIA shareholder sell the shares yesterday at 6.42   which means sacrificing the dividend  and buy back today at 6.26 or lower? The difference is more appealing than holding for dividend  unless you want to keep long term.  This is something worth pondering  but may not be applicable to other shares when  liquidity is tight.👆🏿 sharing fr.
