Lie for what fuck  then why u dare to answer my question .  . You dare to say them lie about certain things. How I know whether they wana split anot as if I know.,btohqsg
I hope not...If not it will be so dull. I'm very curious to see how it pans out. Especially with regards to PSP.I don't really can't really tell where they are standing at besides having that mission statement and goal.IMHO  WP is more clear in where they stand in the left to right political spectrumBy yes  agree. LHL have not shown his best cards yet. Wondering what is under his sleeves. So far only announced 5 years upgrading plans for selected neighborhoods.By the way  you guys should go see PAP and WP websites man... Both designs are sooooo similar to each other. So confusing,btohqsg
Oh ya  hahaha why they look the same,btohqsg

This is a known fact. The regions are regrouped and the boundaries are re-determined every elections. It involves a lot of logistic and administration implications. The government will only do this for strong good reasons.,btohqsg

Just got this from a Friend. Written by an 89 year old Pioneer Citizen  addressed to the Present PAP Cadres.Long Read  by Worth every Bit of timeChang Jiang Low:人民行動黨已經迷失了方向。。。。SG Must readKindly share it out to all andThanks to this 89 year old mother/citizen who took pains to summarise all these critical points as a letter to PAP Cadres and it may awaken the rest of the people of True facts and extremely The Online Citizen 2019-02-28 Lettersby Diana SharmaThis is an open letter to all People’s Action Party (PAP) cadres:  Please  please  please rethink why you enter politics and look at the direction that the current PAP is going.I sincerely believe that most Singaporeans who enter politics  regardless if they join the PAP or the opposition parties  do so with a pure heart to serve Singapore and her people.In fact  that was the reason why PAP was very popular in the 1960’s.  The pioneer batch of PAP politicians served Singapore with all their hearts and souls. They commanded the trust and respect of most Singaporeans.Today  all Singaporeans  especially the older generation  are grateful to PAP for leading and transforming Singapore from a third-world country in the 1960’s to a modern city-state in the 1990’s.Undeniably  PAP was not perfect and Lee Kuan Yew could be an absolute autocrat who inflicted extreme cruelty to any dissenting voices and political opponents.  However  no matter how one looked at it  we have to agree that PAP had indeed done an excellent job in bringing Singapore to where it is today.  We only need to look at our neighbouring countries:  Malaysia  Indonesia  Philippines  Vietnam  Thailand  etc  and compare the progress made over the same timeframe from 1960s to 1990s.Indeed  one of the reasons for the continued support for PAP during General Elections is the perception that they worked very hard to the interests of Singaporeans at the foremost and they are competent to bring about positive changes to lead the country forward.Unfortunately  the same can no longer be said over the past 20 over years from 1990s to today.  I personally feel that the hearts and souls of PAP are no longer with the common people to bring Singapore to new heights.PAP MPs are so far detached from the average Singaporean that they live in a separate world by themselves.The Current State of Affairs:Take  for example  of PAP ministers telling Singaporeans to buy into the Asset Enhancement Scheme for Housing Development Board (HDB) flats and promising that the value of HDB flats will never go down.After tens of thousands of Singaporeans used up all their life savings and Central Provident Fund (CPF) monies to buy HDB flats  they announced that all HDB flats will be returned to the government at zero costs at the end of the 99-year leases.In fact  some readers even commented that this is nothing more than an elaborate scheme to buy votes  since PAP had also openly stated that the HDB upgrading were prioritised by the PAP vote share.Interestingly  most  if not all  PAP MPs do not live in HDB flats and they do not need to return their HDB flats to the government at the end of the 99-year leases.PAP ministers pay themselves in excesses of $1 million while the entire economy is mis-managed with PMET unemployment hitting new highs.Instead of standing together with Singaporeans and giving them solid support to tide over the difficult times  PAP made life even more difficult by increasing GST  electricity prices  water prices  town council fees  transportation costs  ERPs  airport taxes  university fees  property taxes  parking charges  carbon taxes  sugar taxes  etc.,btohqsg
As if to add insults to injury  PAP MPs pay $365 for one whole year of parking  while demanding our teachers to pay for school parking. CPF monies pay-outs are automatically deferred to 70 years of age  even though it was supposed to help provide financial support for the retired.  And to top it off  they put the blame of economic mismanagement onto the common people and told them to pay more money to nurture skills in order to upgrade their skills so that graduates can become cooks and cab drivers.Education has become an elitism breeding ground for the PAP families.While PAP ministers openly claimed that “All schools are good schools”  it is a doubt as to whether anyone of them ever sent their children to neighbourhood schools.Finally  top school students are guaranteed places in Junior Colleges via the Integrated Programmes and Through-Trains Programmes  as well as concession points to enter affiliated Junior Colleges  whereas neighbourhood students are denied such opportunities.Basically  children from PAP families no longer compete with children from the average Singaporean families on the level-playing fields. Our education system serves more to separate the elitist family children from the common Singaporean children  rather than to provide basic education for all Singapore children.Accountabilities and transparencies are not even low – they are non-existent.  PAP MP spouses and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) paper generals are parachuted into high positions in governmental agencies whereby they will just move on to other high positions when they perform poorly.The list of failures and wastage includes Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) being sold to a foreign entity  Keppel corruption scandal  multiple MRT breakdowns  building the non-functioning National Stadium  multiple confidential data breaches in SingHealth  numerous deaths in SAF  near collapse of SPH  paying millions to Uber for a system when Uber intending to sell the business to Grab  overspending millions for the Youth Olympics and building a non-existent High-Speed Railway  and overspending billions to build Airport Terminal 5 (and increasing airport taxes so much so that airlines divert to other airports)  Tuas Mega-Port (with China building an even larger port in Malaysia).The only exception to moving on for poor performance is Ho Ching in Temasek Holdings. Ho Ching continued to draw high pay package (estimated to be more than $100 million annually) even when Temasek Holdings lost billions from multiple investments  including Bayer shares  Hyflux shares  toxic credit-related products during the Lehman Brother crisis  Thaksin’s Shin Cooperation shares and the Suzhou Industrial Project  etc.In fact  some readers speculated that this is the primary reason why CPF monies was withheld while taxes and utility fees rocketed sky high.  The President is supposed to serve as a check on the National Reserves and  in order to ensure no independent candidate can ever be elected as a President  the entry bar is now set so high that even the remaining handful of qualified independent candidates will rather enjoy their personal wealth than to risk getting into potential fallout with the government.In the meantime  an Indian is selected to be a Malay President in order to maintain racial harmony  whereas the issue of a Malay or Indian Prime Minister is conveniently brushed aside even though voiced by many Singaporeans.  Look at our National Budget!  There is no directionality or leadership to lead Singapore forward.  Instead  it is almost like a bribery whereby tax monies are dispersed to Singaporeans once every four years  just prior to the General Elections.Serve Singapore with Moral IntegrityAs a true-blue daughter of Singapore  I now call upon all PAP cadres to do self-reflection.  Search deep within yourself and ask yourself these questions. Is this how you want to serve Singapore? Is this the proper way to govern and lead the country?,btohqsg
Stand back and take a hard look at the current state of affairs. Is PAP really acting for the good of Singapore?  What has PAP done for Singapore over the past 10 years that has benefited Singapore as a whole?I think the answer is very obvious if you search within your heart. I beseech you to uphold your integrity and exercise moral courage.Stop being part of the PAP system. Leave the PAP system and start anew.  Join another political party. Or form a new political party to serve Singapore if you feel that all the opposition parties are not good enough to serve Singapore.  Remember that history will eventually reflect the current state of affairs.Do you seriously think that the Singapore Archives can be locked away forever?  If the PAP is so above board as it tries to portray itself  then it should declare to the public how much exactly are the PAP ministers and Ho Ching are being paid and open the Singapore Archives.  What is there to hide?You do not want to be identified as part of the PAP system when that happens and you do not want your own descendants to scorn at you in contempt.So leave this system now while you still can. Start afresh and really work to serve Singaporeans. Goh Chock Tong and Heng Swee Keat can take the lead. They can have some self-dignity and self-respect and they should stop working as seat warmers.If you choose to stay behind because of the huge pay checks  then stop lying to Singaporeans that you are stepping forward to serve the people. You are nothing more than a selfish elitist!VOTE THE ALTERNATE PARTIES FOR YOUR OWN FUTURE AND YOUR FAMILY,btohqsg

Ho Ching Salary is been talk in Taiwan talk show  which always tell lies  Because of the recently Taiwan Ho Ching  mask saga. Some readers speculated = more lies. I managed to get all my father CPF. Where got the withheld?,btohqsg
Perhaps reality is as what you mention however perspection is a very dangerous thing. Her current role as chair person and the duties are not clear cut to justify the payment of “supposedly high salaries” how much we don’t know but we can all speculate amidst non clarification,btohqsg
The talk show 黃世聰 say HO Ching is from China immigrate to Singapore  first lie. But wiki write born 27 March 1953 (age 67) Colony of Singapore  黃世聰 talking about it  This person is a liar and never do homework.2019年8月，台湾电视“财经名嘴”黄世聪在节目中声称“大陆人吃不起榨菜”，黄世聪是这么说的：大陆有只股票叫“涪陵榨菜”，品牌旗下的榨菜在大陆人心目中堪称“泡面搭档”。但黄世聪错把“涪陵”的“涪（fú）”读成了“péi”。 [1]  他表示：“大家如果知道的话，榨菜是他们中国大陆吃泡面的时候一定要加的。那这个业绩好的时候，表示中国大陆一般中下阶层他们是过着不错的日子，因为他们都吃泡面配榨菜，但是你知道吗？这个涪陵榨菜在最近一段时间股价大跌、业绩大坏！为什么业绩大坏？他们连榨菜都吃不起，所以这就是个非常大的警讯。” [1]  引发两岸网友群嘲。吃榨菜也被推向了继茶叶蛋之后的新的“炫富高度”。随后，A股上市公司涪陵榨菜寄送了榨菜给黄世聪，也有网友表示要给他邮寄。黄世聪2019年8月16日 [1-2]  发文表示已经收到了两箱榨菜，并说“想到如此贵重的礼物到手，心情无限激动”。他还说希望大家别像他一样念错字，多多了解中国大陆的风俗民情。 [2]  8月底，黄世聪因在节目里提到北斗卫星导航系统而再次登上热搜 [3]  ，吹捧大陆的北斗卫星系统范围大又精准，超越GPS成为霸主。You can see the comment in the video say all are lying.These clowns bring shame to Taiwan那么喜欢挖别人家来做炒作人生攻击，说的那么厉害，那去挖下你们国家的政治人物来炒作下记得再去炒作你们的契爷你们口缺德The talk show got people lying not the first time.
