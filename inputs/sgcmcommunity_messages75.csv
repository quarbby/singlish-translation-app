I'm urgent on selling cuz I can't pay the monthly loan alr,btohqsg
Try do grab and hitch (grab and ryde) to cover? And u can also rent out ur car via drivelah,btohqsg
If dun need sell for cash,btohqsg
I can't do grab cuz I don't have the private hire thing,btohqsg
I'm selling it at my full settlement amount only,btohqsg
I would assume the car is over 7 years old so cannot do,btohqsg
My pay got cut alr cuz my company change my position,btohqsg
Cause if like that  hard to sell cause your loan probably higher than market price,btohqsg
Means if u sell ur car can settle full settlement and no cash back?,btohqsg
Then rather u rent out ur car,btohqsg
$50 per day also can cover your cost while waiting for your car to sell,btohqsg
I'm ok with no money taking back alr cuz I really want get rid of the loan,btohqsg
Yea jus sign up all e hitch platform n jus whack all the limit everyday Do lalamove for short trips/deliveryDen also post ur car on drivelah and rent out,btohqsg
Until ur car get sold.. if not also jialat bro,btohqsg
LalamoveMilkrunGogovanPickupsFoodPandaYou put your car at Drive Lah to rent out. $50-70/day,btohqsg
Need factor in his petrol cost also,btohqsg
I got think of drivelah but they confirmed want apply for commercial insurance,btohqsg
Need meh. They pay e insurance for u i tot,btohqsg
Yea best is just do lalamove for 3 hours like that to get $50,btohqsg
They have their own insurance. You check it out first.,btohqsg
Then you do two weeks enough already to cover 1 month,btohqsg
How much you selling it for,btohqsg
58k the full settlement amount only,btohqsg
Anyone can buy my car pls pls,btohqsg
Eh yours is the black one in sgcm is it,btohqsg
Still have 6years and 6month COE,btohqsg
Say good bye to credit score and let it get repo,btohqsg
Have you tried selling back to the original plave you bought it from?,btohqsg
Yes but they taking it back low,btohqsg
From what I see you purchased very recently because their post of your car still up there,btohqsg
Hi there!! If it helps  its best for you to head down to our Sgcarmart Quotz inspection centre to have your car inspected and then get a proper quotationüòä-R,btohqsg
Yes I brought it on July then after a month ltr my company change my position then my pay low alr so it's make me can't afford and continue paying,btohqsg
I had been stress for 3 weeks alr,btohqsg
Hope someone can help me out on this,btohqsg
U got ask ur dealer if u push back need pay how much,btohqsg
I got ask them to take back but they say they take back in at around 30k,btohqsg
In the very worst case u push back  refinance the 28k with the dealer if they allow and see whether they can work out a repayment plan for u,btohqsg
Cause I first time buying a car then when I go down to view the car the dealer keep intro the goods of this car and they say they will help me make the monthly affordable but then idk tht they taking the loan seem high,btohqsg
I think it's best you take the advice of others to gain a side income for the time being while you wait for the car to be sold as from the looks of it  your price is very inflated and will be a hard sell,btohqsg
Dk u have to speak to ur dealer and ask them to work out a repayment plan for u,btohqsg
Lower as the dealer say can don't need down so much,btohqsg
https://www.quotz.com.sg/cars-for-bidding?MOD=Chevrolet+&FR=Any@xhao_xzxYou can take a look at the prices of chevy Aveo5 that were transacted on Sgcarmart Quotz to get an approximate idea of how much you can sell your car for,btohqsg
If you are satisfied with it  you can get your car inspected by Sgcarmart Quotz and get them to help you sell your car as quickly as within a day.-R,btohqsg
But the link u send I see but the price all can't cover the full settlement amount,btohqsg
It definitely wotn cover full amount,btohqsg
The coe expiry diff from urs also bro,btohqsg
no matter what it will never cover cos u have to pay rule of 78 i assume + u bought it at a very inflated price,btohqsg
Bro serious best advice is to consign and post at sgcm. Just work lalamove part time while waiting for you car to be sold. No need special insurance or the phv sticker. Just do 5 orders to get $50. Work two weeks can get 700 liao. DO NOT BORROW MORE MONEY TO PAY YOUR MONTHLY EVEN FROM LICENSED MONEY LENDER. That will only dig your hole even deeper.,btohqsg
And u cant expect to cover. There def be losses but what u need now is to make it the minimal loss and find ways to get cash now,btohqsg
Last time the car was sold over at quotz,btohqsg
at 10 years old  the car paper value with fresh 10 year COE was 30kNow at 14 years old  you bought it for 65-70k,btohqsg
25k coe with 5k rebate of ARF,btohqsg
u try to sell now at arnd 50k,btohqsg
Oh yes  this car damn rare tbh. But just trying to give our friend here an idea of what to expect-R,btohqsg
50k is already a very optimistic price if u ask me,btohqsg
its a korean car with a american badge.,btohqsg
Cuz my friend say this car is rare and he suggest me to buy this car so I brought it but end up I can't afford,btohqsg
Where is that friend now? Ask him for help,btohqsg
But got two types of rare,btohqsg
Another one is collecter‚Äôs car like that,btohqsg
I ask him alr he say he can't help,btohqsg
Cherry qq also now considered rare,btohqsg
yeah haha cannot blindly follow sometimes,btohqsg
I think the best is follow some of the bros said. Do the lala or what to cover. That‚Äôs your only hope.,btohqsg
buang one time lorry see queen elizabeth waving at u,btohqsg
But just a personal advice from me  if you are a point A to B commuter  just go for the most common cars you see on our road - there‚Äôs a reason why they are everywhere (Eg. Economical  reliability)-R,btohqsg
I completely agree with Imran and suggest you do this,btohqsg
Rare cars arent good if u dont have deep pockets. but we can discuss abt that next time,btohqsg
we try to solve the problem at hand,btohqsg
Yea. Now just go sign up those apps n start picking jobs,btohqsg
Solve the short term problm first,btohqsg
My full time job is delivery attendants night shift,btohqsg
So basically afternoon about 3 pm start work then until early morning then end,btohqsg
if u can do with less rest and downtime  lalamove in the day is viable!,btohqsg
Okay any possibility u can try to squeeze a part time job in?,btohqsg
its only a temporary thing so u can pay this few months worth of installment,btohqsg
but take care of yourself too please hahaha,btohqsg
I had try to squeeze a part time job but end up not enough sleep then tht day while I driving my company lorry then I hit a car on road,btohqsg
@xhao_xzxYes  can try this ^Unless you really cannot dong the loan anymore and need let the car go ASAP then just pay $10 go Quotz and get an actual offer and then sell your car thru them,btohqsg
Cut down your expenses also can help,btohqsg
I staying with my mother in a rental HDB house,btohqsg
I had cut down a lot alr,btohqsg
sorry bro which one is your car,btohqsg
The black Chevrolet aveo5 at sgcarmart,btohqsg
She old alr then her pay not high also,btohqsg
How much you earning? Roughly  no need give exact,btohqsg
What expenses you have right now?,btohqsg
Yes but sometimes after cpf I get back around 1.6 only,btohqsg
really hard sell  sorry to hear that bro,btohqsg
Bills and rental fee the car loan and the petrol,btohqsg
ur workplace accessible by bus or train?,btohqsg
maybe can cut down abit on petrol if take bus ah,btohqsg
not convenient definitely but i think it might save some $,btohqsg
Bro if cpf is none of your concern,btohqsg
Quit your job and do lalamove full time or grab,btohqsg
Honestly you can earn more if you work hard,btohqsg
And slowly pay off for the car while waiting to sell and get the liability off,btohqsg
A car in sg will always be a liability. If you really need to let it go urgently  you can try to lower the asking amount and just see what you can get back but that also means you‚Äôll need to tank whatever losses there is,btohqsg
But can't really get what people say 6-7k per month,btohqsg
3-4k very gd n decent alrdy,btohqsg
Bro you aim 3k enough already,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt be so ambitious right now,btohqsg
I doing lalamove part time also  drive from 4-7/8 I earn 70-100 depending on what kind of day I have,btohqsg
I HIGHLY suggest you do the same right now,btohqsg
My workplace here if Got OT I monthly also abt 3k but the OT mean no sleep must work day and night,btohqsg
Really drastic would be yeah  to change jobs and get whatever jobs you can that can help to pay off the monthly loans easier. Freelancing jobs usually may pay more but you really gotta work hard,btohqsg
It is a painful lesson you‚Äôve learned,btohqsg
Ya thts y I regard buying a car,btohqsg
Everything can work out if you willing to put in the effort,btohqsg
Talk to someone too if you‚Äôre too stressed out,btohqsg
Got alot of outlet online to help with your stress,btohqsg
6-7k is probably like the top 0.5%,btohqsg
I don't want to have hit other people car anymore,btohqsg
it‚Äôs possible but highly unrealistic too,btohqsg
Cuz tht time not enough sleep then driving lorry then hit people car end up I have to pay also,btohqsg
Now I scared driving on road also tbh,btohqsg
After the accident happen I drive more slwoer then other people cuz I had a fear when seeing people car flashing the rear red light,btohqsg
i think u can try not driving for awhile and take public transport,btohqsg
and if u got season parking  parking will not be an issue,btohqsg
But I don't want waste the money on paying this few month and left the car in the carpark,btohqsg
Rather than you drive and pour money on petrol and cashcard,btohqsg
U save on expenses on the car bro,btohqsg
that‚Äôs alm 400 a month leh,btohqsg
400 a month could be very helpful,btohqsg
The more you drive the more wear and tear gonna happen,btohqsg
Consession also only 1xx per month,btohqsg
I forgot exactly for adult how much,btohqsg
letting go of some creature comforts,btohqsg
Pls I want sell off my car hope someone can buy my car even at 57k I'm ok I can't try ask my friend to lend me abit money to top up,btohqsg
it‚Äôll only make the situation worst,btohqsg
Bro you beg on your knees also if noone Interested also wont buy,btohqsg
Now you need to sacrifice time,btohqsg
Bro we r helping u n giving u suggestions. If u dont take our advice and put it into action  no one is gonna help u. Only u can help urself,btohqsg
You gotta start thinking objectively now. Fuel  parking  ERP  you gotta pay everything once the car is running on the road. Whatever you‚Äôve already paid for like season parking  don‚Äôt think about it and don‚Äôt spend any further in other to make it ‚Äúworth your while‚Äù. Cut your expenses and losses and keep your focus on the monthly instalments at the moment until you get to sell the car.,btohqsg
Tht time cuz of part time job I tahan for 2 week then I got into accident,btohqsg
Do other part time job that doesnt require driving,btohqsg
But my full time job required me to drive,btohqsg
Parcel delivery full time can earn money also,btohqsg
Now no need to think about cpf contribution,btohqsg
I want buy I need get rid of this car first cuz sending parcel they have van,btohqsg
borrow someone bicycle do grabfood also can make decent money without driving,btohqsg
Look into other full time jobs,btohqsg
Bro got some can accept cars,btohqsg
Try to combine jobs that you can do with less rest and sleep,btohqsg
Worst comes to worst  get a new job. If you can get something flexible and works for you  go for it. If a job allows you more time to do some part time work  look into that. Explore your options seriously. Don‚Äôt brush it off and really look into it,btohqsg
I did but they want the study cer,btohqsg
Car is not easy to sell and get rid of.U have to make do of the current situation n make the best out of it while waiting,btohqsg
Forget about the car because there's not much you can do with it  just leave it in a parking spot and try to pay it off while you wait to sell it,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt look at cert  i think,btohqsg
Bubble tea shop also got $7-10/hr. Confirm no need cert in making bubble tea,btohqsg
but bro i‚Äôm begging you to promise us,btohqsg
i understand it‚Äôs a hard situation but that can only make it worst,btohqsg
Ya it may seem like a happy ending but in reality you‚Äôre just digging a deeper hole,btohqsg
sorry  are you muslim or scared of dogs by any chance,btohqsg
dog walking is a very lucrative industry,btohqsg
i have friends making 5 figures from dog walking,btohqsg
usually 15/20 dollars for 30 mins,btohqsg
can walk multiple dogs at 1 time also if you good,btohqsg
one shot walk 3-4 dogs as a begginer,btohqsg
pawshake is like grab for pet walking,btohqsg
thats 60$ for half an hour,btohqsg
Provided u can handle dogs and have proper dog training,btohqsg
Its not something that anyone can do. U mus be able to read the dog signs and is a dog person,btohqsg
I am deathly afraid of dogs,btohqsg
There are a lot of options out there for you to choose from. You will have to work hard for the coming months but I‚Äôm sure you can get out of this predicament as long as you put in the hard work. It‚Äôs unfortunate that you are in this plight but you just gotta work it out until the car is sold.Hell  even offer to wash your neighbourhood‚Äôs cars if there isn‚Äôt someone doing it. People may be willing to pay $5 a wash  soap and water is cheap so the margins are high.,btohqsg
drop this chat a text if u need,btohqsg
this chat is 100x more wholesome without d1ckhead pete,btohqsg
Wash car also can earn good money,btohqsg
WAH THANK GOD HE ISNT HERE RIGHT NOW,btohqsg
i was abt to suggest too,btohqsg

I can assure you its normal bro. If you don't feel stress then a bit weird hahaha-R,btohqsg
Also please don‚Äôt do stupid things,btohqsg
The good thing about being rock bottom is that it‚Äôs only going to go up from there onwards.,btohqsg
Slowly. Breathe. You‚Äôre okay. You are going to be okay.However  you need to stop trying to get rid of the problem and take it head on. Running from it will only end with you getting caught.Think about your situation and what you are willing to do. End of the day  it‚Äôs about how far you‚Äôd want to go to get out of your situation. Asking for someone to bail you out will do you no justice.There was some great suggestions on the chat. Just calm down  think about it and TRY. You never know  you might be able to come out way on top than just affording the car..,btohqsg
Such a philosophical can of sardine.,btohqsg
I‚Äôll take that as a compliment?,btohqsg

@awj_moodi just wanted say goodnight bro,btohqsg
"And you will be somewhat ""protected by high paper""",btohqsg
@awj_moodi wanted to also say that sgcm really appreciates ur presense and advice,btohqsg
It is not if you have a 50-60k coe,btohqsg
but when u pay what 160k for a fresh 10 years,btohqsg
and most dont even look well maintained,btohqsg
When your coe pqp is 107k alr. Its different vs paying eg 120k for a fd2r with 20k paper,btohqsg
exactly i feel that its all damn overpriced,btohqsg
Its not the car that is overpriced for the 86/brz,btohqsg
1 dollar is a dollar too many,btohqsg
okay looking at the ARF also  its abit ridiculous,btohqsg
30k in ARF  end of 10 years is 15k rebate,btohqsg
most are renewed a few months ago,btohqsg
stock okay  modded tastefully with high quality mods is okay,btohqsg
but u see some w half done bodykits,btohqsg
plus boxer i believe do require a certain amount of care,btohqsg
Heng mine is not liddat lor,btohqsg
urs is a good example of a properly modded,btohqsg

Tbh a quick paint job 1+k can respray back alr. Cheaper than wrap and look/last better,btohqsg
Tbh i not a fan of wrap cos doesnt have that deep effect if you polish it up,btohqsg
the black parts are paint too?,btohqsg
Good thing my rickshaw is powered by higher capacity human  5.5 litres of blood usually,btohqsg
Apparently only 1 of 2 factory trd 86,btohqsg
yeah.. panel gaps are huge  lots of dirt deposit in between panel and bodykit,btohqsg
Hahaha noe then u mention it. The panel gaps do look a little uneven,btohqsg
But anyway at 160k. It is a tough price to swallow but like u said paper is already 115k,btohqsg
Not like the fd2r like what clement said,btohqsg
I dont think this is a bubble. Cos coe will not crash  it will just gradually drop.and the used car market will just drop together.,btohqsg
Last time Evo only 6 7k depre,btohqsg
Ya last time coe cars had no value,btohqsg
Market shifted within 2 to 3 years,btohqsg
I think as coe price goes up  people start to consider coe cars.,btohqsg
You‚Äôre stuff that legend‚Äôs made of.,btohqsg

Morning! I‚Äôm super late as usual haha but also encourage you to have a good think about the very good and well meaning advice from the folks here - much as often it isn‚Äôt what we want to hear. To sum up what all the guys have been saying (and we all did this too at some point in our lives)  look at what the freelance or gig economy can offer you on top of your usual job. The freelance economy is here to stay and its growth was accelerated during Covid. It saved many people‚Äôs livelihoods (PHV  delivery worker all forms part of this sector). Find something that works for you. for example take a look atfreelancezone.com.sg,btohqsg
There are many resources out there you can tap on for sure. Whatever you do just don‚Äôt dig another hole to fill a hole like take a loan from someone else. a common car loan situation like yours where the loan remaining is higher than market value is still possible to get out of with some hard work. Imagine the housing crisis in the US back then when property values crashed and banks called for top ups which many who over committed and primarily lived their lives on credit and monthly paycheck to paycheck couldn‚Äôt do.,btohqsg
That is a very good hint towards buying with more head than heart.,btohqsg
@xhao_xzxA lot of messages above but i think if u must have the car for your day job  try to cover the cost with lalamove and others like what the rest have suggested. Every little bit counts. And if your pay has been cut to 2k plus  i think u full time lalamove might be abke to earn more. I have a contact for food delivery as well  fixed timing every weekday  that alone can cover the car costs. Let me know if u want.,btohqsg
Above suggestions is based on no choice but to keep the car  be it for day job or to avoid huge losses.,btohqsg
Any guess what kind of scam is this ü§£,btohqsg

good morning y‚Äôall! can I ask if anyone has 2x F1 Pit Lane Experience tickets to spare / that you are willing to sell at decent pricing? ü•π would be super grateful if you do ü•≤ thank you  ü´∂üèª,btohqsg
I‚Äôm 25  male  at Joo Koon.,btohqsg
I tried to ballot for it but didn't get it - J,btohqsg
Joo Koon not very appealing tho. Need passport to go there - J,btohqsg
they said that it wasn't transferrable!,btohqsg
ahh but people have been selling them for a few hundred already ü•∫,btohqsg
this fella still trying so hard to get free packet of nasi padang,btohqsg
ah i see! bc initially they stated in their ballot t&c's that it's not transferrable  but in my successful ballot email  they just said they'll be sending the unique qr code closer to date - but not sure if they'll be checking id to the names,btohqsg
You‚Äôll reach here in no time in your Wish lor!,btohqsg
Wait.. i didn‚Äôt even get the chance to report!,btohqsg
Wow you managed to get it! Congrats! - J,btohqsg
You should come here some time. It‚Äôs actually quite a cool hip place now ^^,btohqsg
yeah I was worried about that too  so I‚Äôm hoping that I can buy 2 tickets at decent prices.. just in case they check ID and i end up not being able to use the tickets (if I manage to get them) üôÅ pretty sure no one will refund because they only balloted to sell off the tickets in the first place üíî,btohqsg
but so excited for you! congrats ü•≥! ‚ú®,btohqsg
thank you!! and yeah it sucks that there are a lot of ppl out there who aren't actual fans that only balloted just to make a profit and there's less out there for all of us fans,btohqsg
My hopes and dreams of synthetic fuels replacing EV and hydrogen cell powered EVs come crashing,btohqsg
They say the same thing regarding the tickets as well but they're still on sale now aren't they?,btohqsg
Don't have pit lane experience  that one I also unsuccessful ballot,btohqsg
hope you have the best time! what a way to start off F1 weekend üëªyess I was so gutted bc my brother & I have been big fans since we were in primary school  so I was hoping to get the tickets - especially after getting him a ticket for the race that he can‚Äôt go to now because he got called back for IPPT üò© such bad luck üÜò,btohqsg
I think a lot of non-fans joined the ballot at the F1 trucks that went around SG.. don‚Äôt think they were aware of it but they seemed to join in whenever they saw someone scan the QR code on the trucks üôÅ,btohqsg
yeah  and you don't have to point out the obvious or be not nice about it. i'm just saying regarding the ballots because as much as people like to break the rules  i just don't want people to get scammed especially when this pit experience thing is limited compared to the tickets  if they can help it.,btohqsg
ahhhh :( will you be going for the grand prix though!,btohqsg
yeah HAHAH i saw it too when i went for the screenings,btohqsg
they just went up to the front to scan it,btohqsg
Wasn't trying to be rude  just trying to say that those terms are mentioned for all event tickets but they are still for sale and if you find the right seller you wouldn't get scammed :),btohqsg
I'm not too sure if this year's pit lane experience has a driver meet and greet like past years with all the drivers,btohqsg
yeah I was a lil frustrated about it bc I realised that hordes of people just joined in and a lot are prolly not gna use their tickets / gna sell them off.. what a waste if some don‚Äôt even show up üò≠,btohqsg
Since they're doing a format similar to European races and having them come out on stage on one of the days one by one,btohqsg
The same thing with the grand prix tickets too  many buy just to sell on for profits. Just the sad reality now with events  can't do much about it,btohqsg
Well there might be some scammers around but most are selling at 10 to 30% markups on the tickets and negotiating,btohqsg
I think the pit lane experience won‚Äôt have the drivers meet & greet since it‚Äôs late at night & they‚Äôre prolly preparing/resting up for practice the next day! and there‚Äôs alr a drivers meet & greet on Saturday in Zone 1 üòÉ,btohqsg
"And although it ""isn't allowed"" every event like this has tickets on sale for those who are willing to buy",btohqsg
Yupp  until 2019 the driver's meet and greet was with the pit lane experience,btohqsg
Same timings as now for the pit lane experience,btohqsg
The zone 1 meet and greet for Saturday is new to Singapore and is more of a drivers coming out on stage and speaking format,btohqsg
yupp I never managed to ballot successfully / never went for it before ever since I got back to SG in 2017 ü•≤,btohqsg
Well at least you have tickets to the grand prix and can visit zone 1 and try to stand near the driver swipe gates to get some autographs or pictures for yourrl brother,btohqsg
ahh do u know where those gates are? never tried to catch them in person like that before!,btohqsg
Might be hard getting a refund from the F1 team for your other ticket  would be best to sell it at list price to someone else who might not have been able to snag them up when they were first released,btohqsg
They're right next to gate 1a for patron entrance,btohqsg
There's usually metal barriers separating the areas but it is possible to stand there and get some autographs as some drivers usually stop to meet fans,btohqsg
One driver who never stops is Lewis Hamilton so if you're a fan  that's one you'll probably miss out on,btohqsg
I‚Äôll try to track down where that is,btohqsg
this is exactly why I‚Äôve never been a fan of him üòÇ,btohqsg
my all-time favs are Michael Schumacher  Kimi Raikkonen & Max üß°,btohqsg
He hides in the backseat of whatever car he drives to the circuit usually,btohqsg
And gets dropped off as close to the swipe gates as possible,btohqsg
he was literally lying down and napping/sleeping in the backseat of one recently üòÇ,btohqsg
is anyone going to Amber Lounge btw? after the race - the drivers show up at times üëÄ,btohqsg
MAX MAX MAX SUPER MAX MAX SUPER SUPER MAX MAX MAX SUPER MAX MAX MAX,btohqsg
Cheapest individual pass is 1200 per pax for Sunday,btohqsg
yupp + GST on top of that,btohqsg
I would much rather buy a super nice bottle and enjoy myself knowing that just having a basic pass isn't getting me anywhere near the tables,btohqsg
Or go to one of the other clubs doing an F1 themed night,btohqsg
Much cheaper and still get to have the same fun with better DJs,btohqsg

You want me to drop by again?,btohqsg
Actually you can just put the engine oil and additive on your car and snap a photo and share here - J,btohqsg
With your sick looking FD2 fuyohhhhh,btohqsg

No respect for rickshaw rider :(,btohqsg

btw can request for feature on SGCM here?,btohqsg
what feature do you have in mind sir? - J,btohqsg
would be nice to be able to subscribe to be notified when a car of a certain condition gets listed for sale,btohqsg
instead of having to check daily üòÇ,btohqsg
but just thought it'll be easier to be notified maybe via email when there's a car that matches your requirements,btohqsg
could you elaborate on this? what are the parameters of your 'certain condition'. Because we don't handle used car listings. But  I'm super steady  if it's a function we don't have  I'll feedback for you,btohqsg
