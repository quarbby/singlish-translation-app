so you saying dzj pulling bitches,btohqsg
cos he got circle glasses too,btohqsg
idk if my glasses count as circle,btohqsg
i got smol muscle if that counts,btohqsg
ok nvm bro js has a sad life,btohqsg
also not quite right cos weight is not equal to healthy,btohqsg
What the fuvk am I saying wsit,btohqsg
my weight gain is pure stomach,btohqsg
eh ur gf likes it so,btohqsg
drop the skinny and we have something,btohqsg
ok but i actually do sports a lot,btohqsg
belly fat is the first to be lost,btohqsg
so not like i just let myself go,btohqsg
gym  run  swim  table tennis  softball  bouldering,btohqsg
i used pen and paper for 3 years,btohqsg
pen and paper is shown by studies to be,btohqsg
I judge my friend for using paper and pen,btohqsg
Even tho i do it too,btohqsg
Coz im a hypocritical piece of shit,btohqsg
I judge my fren coz she hv spinal issues but still insist on carrying heavy ass loads of notes and papers,btohqsg
research shows a statistic for results but there are always other factors that sway people one way or another,btohqsg
i got a tablet for convenience. having every single one of notes in one piece of tech,btohqsg
also lets me make things neater,btohqsg
in my dorm last time  got people bring their whole monitor into study room,btohqsg
man I hope people not toxic sia,btohqsg
nah will have toxic people no matter what,btohqsg
just gotta learn how to deal with them,btohqsg
i q tired of such people,btohqsg
and tell everyone your personal shit,btohqsg
it's the p big study room for dorm residents to use,btohqsg
i use pen n paper people used to judge but not ahole kind but they realised they needed my notes so HAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
15 mins later his friend join him,btohqsg
so got two people side by side using monitor,btohqsg
people in my school; use eh,btohqsg
some friends in NTU do that,btohqsg
people gonna try and shit talk you,btohqsg
so guys what are my flaws,btohqsg
tell said person a computing person has to be a therapist friend,btohqsg
straight up ignoring that there r girls in cs too,btohqsg
computing people sacrifice their appearance to get rich,btohqsg
and then they work on appearance later,btohqsg
so they will os called glow up after,btohqsg
same with people who focus on academics,btohqsg
im a coder but my friends all confide in me üíÄ,btohqsg
Biz is dumping ground for ppl that hv no idea what they want in life or wannabe entrepreneur,btohqsg
But rich kids are few and far between,btohqsg
therapist friends are risky y know,btohqsg
if they ever turn their back on you,btohqsg
and they can use it against you,btohqsg
maybe u shld find someone u can actually trust,btohqsg
idk most of the people that confide to me are guys,btohqsg
funny cos there are better majors if you want to be entrepreneur,btohqsg
Biz is not the place to be if u wanna be an entrepreneur,btohqsg
everything is a dumping ground once,btohqsg
engineering used to be the pinnacle of uni,btohqsg
comp used to be a dumping ground,btohqsg
Isnt biz a 70+ rp course also,btohqsg
biz is a dumping ground in usa and other countries,btohqsg
Engineering in western countries and in sg diff,btohqsg
eng not dumping ground in other countries,btohqsg
becos they actually hv an industry,btohqsg
engineering has like extremely high requirements in every country except sg,btohqsg
Engineering in sg is more geared towards doing stuff boss say,btohqsg
also take into account that in america,btohqsg
you usually don't declare your major upon entering uni,btohqsg
Other countries engineer is more of their own boss,btohqsg
like a biz major cant switch to a engineering industry,btohqsg
but engineering can switch over to fnanace,btohqsg
it's not because they engineering  it's cos they are in a quantitative major,btohqsg
but you still need to have some skills la,btohqsg
areas like finance tend to just like majors that are very quantitative in general,btohqsg
do yall think comp is gonna have a downfall,btohqsg
i feel its like a bubble,btohqsg
from what i can tell  it's just a very versatile connector,btohqsg
it's like a powerful usb C,btohqsg
Then the one that would love you ‚Äúunconditionally‚Äù to the greater extent.,btohqsg
only people i've seen get a pro are the ones that almost use it as their laptop,btohqsg
main thing is the refresh rate,btohqsg
for an artist  the 120Hz is very noticeable and big,btohqsg
eh i have samsung just cos i prefer the pen,btohqsg
apple pencil also better for drawing,btohqsg
but in my experience  s pen better for writing,btohqsg
I am gonna start a blog,btohqsg
on how to do basic stuff,btohqsg
from the perspective of an average student,btohqsg
yupp theres not much resources support for retakers,btohqsg
cos they dk how to start,btohqsg
and they think they dumb but its just they dk how study,btohqsg
if yall wanna learn to animate,btohqsg
really depends what you're gonna be using it for,btohqsg
what will happen if yall got covid for a‚Äôs,btohqsg
they will use your other paper marks and see the person before and after for that paper and extrpolate,btohqsg
or you never do more than 50 percent,btohqsg
use prelim grades and see the person before and after,btohqsg
imagine your blood sweat and tears wasted,btohqsg
I would wear a mask not talk to anyone sanitise everything,btohqsg
no they compare w ppl who got roughly same marks as u,btohqsg
and see how they did for As,btohqsg
what's the rules on electric skateboard or scooter,btohqsg
but bro I big fan of him,btohqsg
but yeah he gets ard nyc w eskateboard looks cool ngl,btohqsg
like moving ard w that in uni,btohqsg
thats where I got that idea,btohqsg
you know last time i was never satisfied,btohqsg
Meanwhile singapore uni hills be like death for skateboards,btohqsg
but now you realise that simple is better,btohqsg
u cant even take the exams elsewhere or smth uh,btohqsg
they will see what your predicted is,btohqsg
it has a 2 week incubation period,btohqsg
Quotation marks and skepticism and all.,btohqsg
you won't know when exactly you started having it,btohqsg
not to people that are immunocompromised,btohqsg
some of those maybe taking the exam,btohqsg
cos I knew this could happen,btohqsg
I had shingles and had to take chem,btohqsg
general trends tend to make smth like covid more transmissible over time,btohqsg
but at this point still hard to say,btohqsg
holy shit we are becoming dads bro,btohqsg
all the dads are the only ones talking about covid tech and jobs,btohqsg
if u did well in prelims its good,btohqsg
how can have greater extent üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
my mum always says jesus loves you unconditionally. Abit annoying,btohqsg
it knocks you back on track,btohqsg
get higher grades on your next exam,btohqsg
Its sarcasm  because nothing is ever truly unconditional with mortal beings.,btohqsg
but how ru gonna tell who loves u to a greater extent.....,btohqsg
and its comparatively to ur peers,btohqsg
The extent in which they go  I guess.,btohqsg
"and then u meet this person who is ""better"" in every aspect",btohqsg
I think its abt the value of shared experiences with the person,btohqsg
so not just about how inherently good/well fitting the person is right,btohqsg
Help la im in an abusive relationship with fm,btohqsg
what if the other person has better chemistry w u too,btohqsg
there is very little objectivity with these things,btohqsg
u have huge stakes in this company which is making u money,btohqsg
I wouldn‚Äôt get married unless I am sure that there wouldn‚Äôt be another,btohqsg
but then now theres another company which can be even more profitable,btohqsg
but if u want to invest there u must sell ur stakes in the initial company,btohqsg
it has to be a ride or die thing,btohqsg
Siyan my man i wan dabao mod,btohqsg
if i'm attached  i would not even nurture any friendship that lets someone treat me better to that extent lol,btohqsg
"which wld lead to the initial company downfall becos ""why is their main investor selling away all stocks""",btohqsg
That‚Äôs technical  humans are nuanced and diverse  and emotions are not involved there. I mean  other than impulse and ambition there.,btohqsg
Exactly why we don‚Äôt rush into things,btohqsg
watch how she acts towards the bullied lowly,btohqsg
thinking someone is better is very different from actually interacting with them,btohqsg
also do yall not hv work,btohqsg
Exactly. Red flags. Don‚Äôt marry them. I‚Äôm not saying that find someone with no red flags  because that‚Äôs impossible. I‚Äôm saying figure out how far you‚Äôre willing to put up with them. And which are intolerable.,btohqsg
"Hi bro; I'm much older than most of the peeps in the group (i'm in uni late)but let me give you a 2 cent- I was supposed to BTO my ex  but she fucked my best friend (of 25 years) and it was all kaputdont think too much about love- It comes and go  the person you love rn may or may not be there forever  and that is a sad reality we will have to accept. Sooner or later  as you grow  you will come to the realisation that there is no such thing as ""good for each other"" etc  people learn to be better partners as they grow and mature. There is no ""the one""  only ""lets try"".Maybe i am a jaded man  but trust me on this  dont think too much  your youth is precious- fuck anyone you want  do anything you want  study anything you want. There will come a day where you just ""know"" and it isnt that complicated- and when it does come  you'll truly understand what im saying",btohqsg
best friend of 25 years ?!?,btohqsg
yeap from birth  can you believe tht,btohqsg
Did he just tell me that go screw someone now,btohqsg
we even had the same birthday from the same hospital,btohqsg
no  im telling you to be more nihilistic  do wtv you want,btohqsg
I‚Äôm saying yeah  don‚Äôt get married until you know.,btohqsg
Im close to giving up rn,btohqsg
are you talking about a twin lol,btohqsg
no point studying when ur not in it,btohqsg
Sounds like the kissing booth plot.,btohqsg
cos it sure sounds like it,btohqsg
ok but you're my age then,btohqsg
This is why physic‚Äôs is superior,btohqsg
best friend of 25 years and since birth?,btohqsg
I know I am not in your shoes but you should not treat any other girl like how your ex treated you. theres many fish in the sea,btohqsg
tbh i'm just glad you didn't BTO before finding out though,btohqsg
I thought that she was referring to me. I need to be less self-absorbed.,btohqsg
hahaha no la  is more like dont think too much about life  priortise what makes you happy  do whatever you want in that sense,btohqsg
si yan ru girl or boy,btohqsg
am guy. but yes siyan is a common girl name too,btohqsg
pretty sure thats ground for a lawsuit tbh,btohqsg
I‚Äôd prefer to keep being on team anti-nihilistic please.,btohqsg
idk about that. i've seen exact situations where the couple break up after downpayment,btohqsg
but ur typing style is male,btohqsg
you don't get the money back,btohqsg
nihilism isnt about the lack of meaning  its about making and finding your own meaning,btohqsg
I am gonna work on myself so I can choose the girl I want,btohqsg
"without a divine imposed meaning or a ""universe given meaning""  there is no inherent meaning in everything  only then you are free to have all the meaning you want in life",btohqsg
What‚Äôs the difference in typing styles between genders that you could use to prove it in full proof,btohqsg
"its not the ""edgy LIFE SUCKS EVERYTHING SUCKS"" connotation that people think in mass media",btohqsg
I had a classmate named Si Yan,btohqsg
plus u can kinda infer from the stuff they say,btohqsg
one of my Uni juniors shares my name,btohqsg
but its not abt the nameee,btohqsg
If I cared about whether people think I‚Äôm a guy or girl I‚Äôd leave my profile picture visible,btohqsg
besides she did you a favour,btohqsg
lmao my chinese name is mega feminine too,btohqsg
Step one ‚Äî accept that your opinion of yourself is as deficient as your naming skills  so just let your future wife stick to having the veto on deciding the kids names  k?,btohqsg
ikr  i think im probably happier now,btohqsg
U rly ripping him apart ah,btohqsg
What can you infer from what I‚Äôve said so far,btohqsg
maybe you should be able to differentiate when people are serious or joking,btohqsg
Btw regarding the marriage thing  make sure to have a proper convo about difficult topics beforehand hahaha,btohqsg
isnt gwyn a guy  the prince from dark souls 3 that was the third boss fight,btohqsg
I was going more for sassy quips  but,btohqsg
the only gwyn ik is a girl,btohqsg
isnt gwyn another way of spelling guin for guinevre,btohqsg
Maybe you should be able to differentiate between deadpanning and being downright serious,btohqsg
did you think I was gonna name my kid john octavious joel junior,btohqsg
I thought that is the unspoken requirement,btohqsg
no  gwyn is the lord of cinder  guinevre is the illusion HER BROTHER CASTED  (or big booba princess  depending on how you react to her),btohqsg
the brother is called gwyndolin the dark sun i think,btohqsg
I wouldn‚Äôt put it past you and your sorely deficient naming skills. Plus  your apparently high opinion of yourself.,btohqsg
Unspoken but not common sense unfortunately,btohqsg
that was a joke. I can be serious when I need to be. if you were in a relationship you would know joking is pretty common,btohqsg
its abt how the flags r,btohqsg
are they pink or blood red or black,btohqsg
just depends can tahan or not also,btohqsg
Gwyn Lim? I might‚Äôve met her at smun from innova.,btohqsg
I mean tahan is one thing but must communicate if it‚Äôs smth you don‚Äôt like ma,btohqsg
don‚Äôt just sit there take it,btohqsg
And if you were in a relationship  you‚Äôd know that sassy banter exists,btohqsg
ok la i cant speak for others but to me,btohqsg
its also hard to establish boundaries,btohqsg
Yea that‚Äôs smth I had trouble with too,btohqsg
i think even close friends do,btohqsg
Thank you. That‚Äôs what I said.,btohqsg
break up with ur girlfriend  yeah yeah cuz im bored,btohqsg
Imo a relationship is finding someone that roughly suits u and then go thru process of slowly grinding down the edges u dont like abt each other until it finally fits or one party cant take it anymore and breaks up,btohqsg
but ya i believe its abt chemistry betw the 2,btohqsg
usually is a girl message you hey lets date,btohqsg
Our literature teacher was telling us about how we‚Äôve to commit to one essay question dissection method  and that we can‚Äôt have ‚Äútwo boyfriends  since we‚Äôve to commit to one‚Äù. One of my classmates and I felt called out  because we can‚Äôt even get one  let alone bag two somehow?,btohqsg
Fr that day my we play drinking game my fren dare me to text first girl in my contact say i love u,btohqsg
"""I love you""""what do you want?""",btohqsg
Which girl our age has enough confidence to do that? And through texts  even.,btohqsg
i said i love you to my mum,btohqsg
she replied with a tele sticker,btohqsg
"I think ""our age"" abit diff ah",btohqsg
i said i love you to ur mum,btohqsg
Every time I text a parent figure that  they‚Äôre like  ‚Äúwhat have you done? And what have you done to our Gwyn?‚Äù,btohqsg
i dont text my parents that much,btohqsg
thanks bruv  we all move on eventually ah ‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
what range are we talking here,btohqsg
Some parents better to not talk to too much ah,btohqsg
yall never been in rs meh,btohqsg
So mine with my parents are then? I feel real judged.,btohqsg
think it gets better in time  my relationship was quite strained until recent years  so heres hoping for the best,btohqsg
one of my friends the parents literally had her and her siblings so that in the future they'll be taken care of.,btohqsg
and only did the absolute bare minimum for her,btohqsg
Some ppl are father/mother but not daddy/mommy,btohqsg
isnt this just western vs asian,btohqsg
I am in no position to judge anyone for their relationship with their parents,btohqsg
I mean I haven't spoken to my dad in uh 20 years?,btohqsg
you want me to dm you or smth,btohqsg
My parents are mostly my fren/mentor,btohqsg
I didnt realise how lucky tht is,btohqsg
No  because one is an expired body in the ocean  and the other could be dead after abandoning her 3-year old daughter to run home to China after her maternal grandparents disapproved of their only first grandchild.,btohqsg
the generational gap is a bit weird,btohqsg
I will eventually be in that club.,btohqsg
eh my dad has like 3 extra daughters now,btohqsg
I mean  I didn‚Äôt talk to my father much before he died after professionals refused to believe that a disabled pre-teen can be taken advantage of  too.,btohqsg
I never know how to respond to that  so thank you.,btohqsg
i mean just divorced lol cos cheated,btohqsg
my mum brought up 3 kids on her own,btohqsg
What if I have maternal half-siblings that I never knew about thanks to my deadbeat mother,btohqsg
you may not ever meet them because I've never met my half sisters,btohqsg
"my mum used to poke fun of my dad  saying ""you're destined to not have a son after leaving""",btohqsg
I don‚Äôt even know if my Mom is still alive.,btohqsg
this chat turned emo real fast,btohqsg
Might not be such a bad thing to never know  considering how much of a dead beat she was,btohqsg
My medical professionals and therapists wouldn‚Äôt believe me even after he sexually harassed a married family friend.,btohqsg
theres a reason they signed on,btohqsg
sorry if I was rude yeah,btohqsg
I am sorry abt what you faced,btohqsg
I hate how Singapore doesn‚Äôt even allow for us to have pepper spray on us. Like  if you can‚Äôt take our cases seriously as a priority  at least let physically disabled people carry it around as self-defense.,btohqsg
I changed therapists and stopped talking about it so its fine in suppressing I guess,btohqsg
And this is exactly why I don‚Äôt tell people,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have to worry about that anymore.,btohqsg
Can you go back to roasting me please,btohqsg
He nvr did land a good roast tho,btohqsg
It was quite one sided if im to be honest,btohqsg
I felt abit bad for him in the end,btohqsg
I thought you were genuinely triggered though,btohqsg
Gwyn please train Joel in roasting and banter,btohqsg
Who were you referring to here,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think that I have the capabilities to salvage his skills in that arena.,btohqsg
True  but if you can bring it from like a -100000 to -99999,btohqsg
Its either quite boring or cynically entertaining to watch him flailing around,btohqsg
People call me savage  so. I need to live up to that title.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm snorting unattractively in laughter here.,btohqsg
I like to see someone snort attractively in laughter,btohqsg
Um  try Phoebe Tonkin. Or  anyone other than me.,btohqsg
Also idk how joels acads are,btohqsg
I have a final in 2 days and so much to cover,btohqsg
but this conversation has been interesting,btohqsg
My finals is in less than 24hrs,btohqsg
It has  but we have plenty of more ground to cover after you make sure that finals don‚Äôt kill you first.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt open that can of worms-.,btohqsg
Finals givin me a good spankin,btohqsg
My nxt sem wld hv 6 core mods,btohqsg
What are some good tiktok transition?,btohqsg
IP j mean u did decent at psle,btohqsg
This concept called  ‚Äúfut the wuck are you doing wasting your time on it instead of studying?!‚Äù.,btohqsg
Some of us peaked way too early.,btohqsg
i know some smart people have no eq,btohqsg
Yeah  but maybe we should stop distracting them by giving them a reason to procrastinate studying.,btohqsg
side note  but just as you said that  one of my friends said he's withdrawing from the program...,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt I tell you to go study,btohqsg
eh he realised it's not for him,btohqsg
chill man I am tired of memorising dna replication like 30 times,btohqsg
Wait  no I‚Äôm not enabling his procrastination,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure that some people do.,btohqsg
you are draining my life force,btohqsg
you don't need to give evidence that people like you...,btohqsg
Its literally just deoxyribonucleic acid with four bases of adenine  thymine  guanine and cytosine in a sequence of nucleotides.,btohqsg
are you taking your A levels  good luck,btohqsg
Yeah  see  I‚Äôm not even a biology student  and I know that.,btohqsg
Along with the fact that you‚Äôre already pretty burnt from the roasting?,btohqsg
i dropped bio after sec 2,btohqsg
i just finished my assignment anyone wanna play league btw,btohqsg
I do not chill. Chilling? What‚Äôs that like? Either way  go study.,btohqsg
Its the transfer of a methyl group to the C-5 position of the cytosine ring of deoxyribonucleic acid using deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferases  also known as DNMTs.,btohqsg
All the best with yours. What‚Äôs it in  though?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôve to mansplain a biology term to a boy.,btohqsg
Oh  do you know Professor Alfred Lim Wee Chung then?,btohqsg
Step two ‚Äî don‚Äôt ever dare question the judgement and what your future wife tells you  because its supposedly known that she is never wrong  k?,btohqsg
Its getting kinda sad to watch.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not doing that whole helping you study thing. That‚Äôs what your biology textbook is for. Are you even taking notes?,btohqsg
stomp on his corpse  why don't ya,btohqsg
I would‚Äôve said that first  if I wasn‚Äôt busy having a mental breakdown about having being asked this question in the first place. So  thank you for taking one for the team Kuro.,btohqsg
Is that him fighting back? Because I‚Äôd love to give him an award for not even putting in sufficient enough valiant efforts as a consolation prize here.,btohqsg
haha I am still here you know,btohqsg
a lone warrior against the forces of evil,btohqsg
I‚Äôd much rather kill him with success and tag him with a smile. A more worthy way of spending my time  don‚Äôt you think?,btohqsg
He's gonna have zero success at this rate,btohqsg
I just need a B for my classes,btohqsg
so at least it's not that bad,btohqsg
Oh  you think that we‚Äôre friends? That‚Äôs adorable. You‚Äôre not even remotely close to being any where near enough to be considered my competition.,btohqsg
I was about to say that,btohqsg
Is a movie title  but you should go study so you‚Äôd know that fact at the very least.,btohqsg
i wldnt say its well known,btohqsg
That‚Äôs unfortunate. His published research paper on nanotechnology is a revolutionarily life-changing  which must be read.,btohqsg
If you want to send it to me  I don't mind taking a look after my finals.,btohqsg
Granted I've got a ton of other readings to do.,btohqsg
Its not that old. Its literally just younger than the other various coming of age classic teenage movies.,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm not wrong  you could find it online if you searched his full name up.,btohqsg
I found one from the NTU archive,btohqsg
Alright I'll bookmark it for now,btohqsg
CoOl. All the best for finals.,btohqsg
@VoidchordsAlso  we shouldn‚Äôt talk to Joel until after he studies to avoid him finding a reason to procrastinate.,btohqsg
Speaking of which  if you‚Äôre reading this Joel  go study.,btohqsg
Kiss your biology textbook‚Äôs ass and suck up to that instead please.,btohqsg
also coming of age movies arent that popular in general,btohqsg
The Titanic is older. So is dirty dancing  16 candles and fight club.,btohqsg
Maybe  but its considered popular when compared to its own genre.,btohqsg
titanic not coming of age movie tho,btohqsg
bring it on isnt even close to titanics tier,btohqsg
"a classic is ""a work of art of recognized and established value""",btohqsg
bring it on is neither recognised nor established,btohqsg
You are beautiful to me bro,btohqsg
look at the couples around you,btohqsg
Ya man you are beautiful to all of us,btohqsg
I originally said thats an ass thing to be sad about,btohqsg
not for the average dude tho,btohqsg
damn we becoming like those girls in the comment sections,btohqsg
Dm me what he said I beg,btohqsg
lol let‚Äôs not use the term depressed loosely,btohqsg
