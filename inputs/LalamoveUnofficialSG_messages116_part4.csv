Thanks in advance for the shared wisdom,btohqsg
Hey guys just sharing. Don‚Äôt know if u have heard of this hubster thing. It‚Äôs exclusive for lalamove drivers and riders. It pays u a dollar for each f&b trip u take. All u need to do is just upload the photo of the restaurant/shop and the number provided on the website. U get $1 for every upload and $5 for registering. This is not an ad or a scam. I tried it myself. I mean it‚Äôs free money on top of ur orders. Nothing to lose,btohqsg
If u all want to try do DM me. Then all u have to do is sign up on the link I‚Äôll give u. Yeah no money needed for registration or anything so really nothing to lose,btohqsg

Hi guys. Can i ask? Is lalamove car can make it? Like earning wise?,btohqsg
on my off day usually ill do $150-200 from 10am till 8pm,btohqsg
Ouhk. That is the maximun issit boss? Btw thank u in advanced yaüòá,btohqsg
but by then i just wanna chill,btohqsg
Ouh ic.. car fare is usually what is their rate?,btohqsg
and there are breaks in between,btohqsg
depends. i take motorcycle job also,btohqsg
Ouh ic.. so u mean all job avail u take? okok boss thank u for the info.,btohqsg
Correct me if I am wrong. according to CS is ok if pick up delay as long fall within 2 hr,btohqsg
Pick up cannot late boss.What they mean was u pick up and load & drop off and unload inclusive of travelling in the 2hrs duration for moving services.,btohqsg
I reach the pick up location within 15min. After which I slide arrived pick up location. However  there a delay due to no one at home.,btohqsg
I waited till 30min then pick up cargo. Therefore  my understanding for immediate job. When driver arrived the location thing must be ready. If delay after 10min  we can start charging them late charges,btohqsg
In this case  CS replied that all withing time frame of 2 hrs is ok.I told them like that eat grass Liao la.. if really suay kena a 1.7van job and completed near to 2 hrs. Estimation $30++ job for 2 hours.,btohqsg
"For your info  if I never interpreted wrongly.. 2hrs for ""delivery time frame"" after pick up for Van and lorry",btohqsg
"2 key point.- 2hrs ""delivery"" time frame- ""after pick up""",btohqsg
Haha never mind Liao la.. as usual we got no time to play with them! However  it's make us like a fool when talking about their poor guideline/SOP standard.,btohqsg
