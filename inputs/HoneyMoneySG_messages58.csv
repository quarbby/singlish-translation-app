90k in RA does not meet the FRS or BRS for 2023. With plans to shielding you not able to withdraw money from SA after 55. @65  CPF will push funds from SA/OA to RA again if you have not meet FRS by 65.,btohqsg
It's now 8k to self 8k for loved ones. No split to any accounts as long the accounts have not reach the ceiling,btohqsg
But i ask to the cardup service center they reply the evol cc still can earn 0.3% rewards,btohqsg
"uh  based on the uob evol TnC  under definition of ""Transaction""  ""any payment of funds to payment service provider"" is excluded. As such it does not count to ""at least $600 worth of Transactions"".Anyway  u can do what u deem fit. Just that what Cardup service centre say counts to nothing in case u did not clock the minimum spend and did not get your rebate.",btohqsg
Can I confirm for those on Apr-Jul HSBC EGA cycle  we should withdraw on 1Aug right.. since no more promo to recycle to,btohqsg
Can Citigold Fixed deposits made during their promo (3.68%) rolled over upon maturity to another FD at prevailing rates? or are their published rates only a one-time thing for new bank owners?,btohqsg
Even if it’s 8k for self and 8k for loved ones  the tax relief is still capped at 8k or 16k?,btohqsg
Is there anyone here still involved in the ftx n hodlnaut claims?Can someone make a video?Since y'all did recommended the platform initially  not blaming but at least would be good to do a video to explain the situation n how we can claims too,btohqsg
Hi Have the group explore buying US treasury etf likeiShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF?,btohqsg
Just now already double confirm with cardup  the spending is valid,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I just open a cimb fast saver. Just transfer money in will enjoy 3.5% correct? Does it matter if I'm existing credit card holder or need to be new member?,btohqsg
Note that CardUp / iPayMy have been known to be wrong. And they take no responsibility for it. When discrepancies arise  their usual answer is to ask you to check with the bank.,btohqsg
hello  wanna check for EGA bonus 1%  it’s from the 6 transaction onwards or after i completed 5 eligible transaction they will slowly credit me for all? call centre tell me one thing and the online chat tell me 2 different things..,btohqsg
if im not wrong  it is after u clock the requirements then they start giving uI might be wrong though,btohqsg
yeah so it means that it’s the 6th eligible transaction onwards eh? super weird mechanic,btohqsg
their cashback is given on a ad hoc basis 1  i noticed that once the transaction cleared  they will just give u back the rewardsso i think it makes more business sense for them haha. but their validity period is quite long though.,btohqsg
yah sadly i did some big purchases on my first 2 transactions thinking that all will be eligible after the 5th one is completed 🥲 i ask them for appeal they say they don’t have any avenue for appeal,btohqsg
bo bian  if u are using advance  probably can get 1.5% though,btohqsg
U can just transfer in2k on first day of the month then transfer out 5 paynow to fulfill the criteria before u do spending,btohqsg
I do so to mak sure all criteria is hit before i do any spending as i have all my bank cc giro to hsbc ega to enjoy the 1 percent off giro bill payment,btohqsg
yeah thanks for advice! will do so starting aug 😊,btohqsg
Oh shoot  I didn’t know the timing of the 5 transactions to clock matters. I always thought our entire (eg. July) month of cc transactions will be entitled to +1% as long we fulfil the July month criteria of 5 trxn + $2k transfer,btohqsg
You're talking about when the transaction is made right? The transaction must be posted to be eligible iirc.,btohqsg
Ic okay. I mean I thought any transactions made before the 5 transactions are completed  will still be entitled for the +1% as long it all got posted within the same month 😬,btohqsg
Hi  i will be purchasing product from AudioHouse for my renovation and payments need to be made in full. Is there any credit card which can help to earn miles with no monthly capping?,btohqsg
yes  this is correct  it carry from the previous month,btohqsg
Use kris+ to pay and pair with UOB Krisflyer - uncapped 3 mpd from uob kf + 1 mpd from kris+,btohqsg
Are you sure UOB krisflyer gives 3mpd for Audio House purchases? UOB krisflyer 3mpd (provided you spend $800 annually on SIA  Scoot  KrisShop) is only applicable to a whitelisted list of merchants. I do not think Audio House is in that list.,btohqsg
It is 3 mpd for Kris+ transactions. Kindly read TnC,btohqsg
Can kris+ use with DBS women for 4mpd or Citi miles ?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc shd be ok. Citi rewards no coz it's considered in-app.,btohqsg
Hi  I applied for the UOB prvi miles card and im trying to fulfill the $1000 spend for 2 months to get the sign up bonus. Does anyone know if payments made via the Kris+ app to valid merchants (Merchant MCC not part of the exclusion list) count toward the $1000 spend? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
My apologies. I didn't realize Audio House was a Kris+ merchant.,btohqsg
shouldnt be an issue. i had used my kris+ app to make payment to The White Tiffin. UOB had confirmed to me that this restaurant is not part of the exclusion.,btohqsg
they had checked via the mcc,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice. But I think kris + has nerf the earn rate to 1milea per dollar from May 2023 onwards,btohqsg
Use titanium. It’s not capless but it’s up to 13k+ per card (26k for 2 cards). That should suffice,btohqsg
yes but UOB Krisflyer hasn't nerfed and it's uncapped so at least there's still that,btohqsg
I can sense a particular pooh bear from this message 🐻,btohqsg
Yes for DBS WWMC . Citi Miles take note it won't be treated as online (im not sure u mean Citi PM or CRMC),btohqsg
still 1 bonus miles on top of the 3mpd-6mpd on the CC,btohqsg
Hi guys What's the best credit card to link with Shopback app to earn some rewards?Or actually there's no reward if link credit card to Shopback app? Haha,btohqsg
Follows the shop's underlying MCC if i remember correctly.,btohqsg
dbs wwmc yes. If u meant citi rewards mc  need to pair with Amaze to be eligible for 4mpd on kris+.,btohqsg
online cards or categorical cards for the merchant MCC,btohqsg
Nope  no 10x points for that mcc,btohqsg
a Qualifying Charge made at an online retail merchant  excluding *mobile wallet* andtravel-related transactions*Not sure mobile-wallet is referring to app like Shopback ?,btohqsg
no  refers to online/in-app payment using google/samsung/apple pay,btohqsg
DBS Live Fresh & UOB Evol for cashback.,btohqsg
if i pay for my insurance using axs with hsbc revo  does it eligible for cashback ? or is there any credit card strategy to pay for insurance and get cashback,btohqsg
singlife im paying for  how about citi payall ? previously been paying via giro  and missing out on all the cashback/points,btohqsg
If using Citipayall  mean you are paying Citi admin fee to buy miles not earn miles.,btohqsg
Guys  if CRMC+XNAP to scan for hawker foods  is it eligible for 10X points?,btohqsg
No  you need CRMC+amaze as Xnap goes through mobile wallet (gpay)CRMC direct excludes mobile wallet transactions,btohqsg
If using ApplePay  can I use Amaze card inside to scan?,btohqsg
I don't think ApplePay supports Amaze atm,btohqsg
In other words  I need to manually tap Amaze card to recognize 10x points for CRMC?,btohqsg
Means there is no way for Apple users to earn 10x CRMC pts via Xnap atm,btohqsg
What’s the next best card after HSBC Revolution?,btohqsg

Hi  can you convert kris pay mile to krisflyer mile?,btohqsg

Hi anyone have faced issue with UOB One spending refund before? I hit the 500 min spend for this month but one of my txn from May got refunded which caused my spending to drop below 500. As today is last day and I can't post anymore txn in time any recommendation?,btohqsg
Hi  is it better to convert citi rewards point to krispay mile or krisflyer coz krispay only change 10000 point to 3400 mile while krisflyer is 25000 to 10000 mile but have a fees of $27,btohqsg

Guys is it just me or did something happen to Syfe?,btohqsg
If u have little amt then do krispay  if you are transfering a big sum krisflyer direct is still worth it with the 27 dollar conversion fee,btohqsg
Only miles earned within kris+ can be transferred out,btohqsg
If you have an account  go take a look  some other people have also pmed me saying their funds turned 0,btohqsg
How many point then will it be worth the 27 fees,btohqsg
It is up to u to be honest. Transfering to krispay not as worthy. Every 750 krispay is $5,btohqsg
Could be just something wrong with their performance chart UIIf you are worried ping the cust service ~,btohqsg
U can work out the calculatio  yourself. I only do convert during krispay transfer promotion,btohqsg
Checked with the customer service agent. They say it’s something to do with their UI,btohqsg
Cultural revolution v2 under Xidada. Got digital xiaohongshu and now they are culling the intellectual industries. I wonder what next?,btohqsg
I wish India had a cultural revolution  it would solve many problems,btohqsg
Do you know how harmful cultural revolution was?,btohqsg
There is good and bad. Bad that many people died. Good that old habits and cultural norms were completely turned upside down. Today many academics have a more nuanced view of the Cultural revolution.,btohqsg
Just remove the caste system then India would be improved. The cultural revolution removed the intellectuals. All fled to Taiwan which is why TSMC is there and not in China,btohqsg
When I look at India  we all know something has to change with the caste system  social stratification and behavioural norms. But its impossible to administer any change with the current system. Given the size of the population now(thanks  gangetic plains!) probably 600-800 million will perish if it was to happen,btohqsg
I am all for culling of masses. World is already overpopulated. When Genghis Khan killed like 10s of millions the earth cooled down by several degrees,btohqsg
From time to time  life has to begin on a clean slate again,btohqsg
Caste discrimination is  officially illegal in India  but u can’t legislate away what is in people’s hearts and minds.,btohqsg
you can't cull the masses like that unless an asteroid hits the earth just there,btohqsg
but then again suppose an asteroid does hit it won't be that accurate an aim to hit just once place that's over populated,btohqsg
Let's move on and stick to positive personal finance topics,btohqsg

Can i check if i deposited $75k into my gxs acc  the daily interest will be $7.15 everyday?,btohqsg
Or is it cos the interest for $7.15 is too little to reflect on the next day thats y by 2nd day interest is still $7.15?,btohqsg
Posted around 1230-1235am every day for interest earned on previous day.,btohqsg
You need at least accumulate $105 of interest to earn additional $0.01 of daily interest from interest.,btohqsg
Maybe reach $75050 and above n if GXS do rounding  then you will see $7.16.,btohqsg

Which travel agency? Some agencies outside looks using travel mcc code  but inside when tapping/paying your card  they use other non qualified mcc code.,btohqsg
It depends on the bank. I know uob debits one day early  dbs is on due date,btohqsg
There is DP said ASA and Hong Thai mcc code is 7991  not qualified under Travel category.Good luck to you.Best is to use DBS chatbot method to confirm mcc code if you intended to earn more  miles from tour booking.,btohqsg

Topping up grabpay is probably is in the excluded transactions,btohqsg
ok thanks  i checked their T&C din mentioned though  but will try to clock the $500 spend the traditional way  ty,btohqsg
Or else u can check with UOB live chat what is the MCC for topping up grabpay then will be clearer,btohqsg

How is the 30-Day Period counted?The first  day of your 30-day period begins  on the same day when you make your deposit of a minimum of S$1 000 or more during the period from 1 Aug to 31 Aug 2023. Please ensure that you have opted into SMART Park (Excess Funds Management Facility) for your trading account before you make your first  deposit for this promotion.To opt in  please log in towww.poems.com.sg> Acct Mgmt > Online Forms > Excess Funds Authorization.,btohqsg
yes  just deposit and it will auto-subscribe,btohqsg
"the ""M"" in the trade account is known as cash management right?",btohqsg
must this be enabled too or?,btohqsg
Then  I guess the best card would be UOB One card for SP bill payment which I don't own anymore.,btohqsg
Excess fund authorization is good enough. Mine is enabled for multi currency aswell,btohqsg
Oh sorry circled wrong line. Should be just need Excess Fund Authorization,btohqsg

Hi for this UOB National Savings promo  it seems like a 4 mths Fixed Deposit of approx 2.9% interest. Am I understanding it wrongly?,btohqsg
The poems deposit  do I have to do anything to go back to original state after 30 days? Or just leave it at smart park?,btohqsg
is this the right place for the smart park or am i missing something?,btohqsg
Seem like Airpod is the least amount 🤔🤔,btohqsg
From reading T&C  indeed it's basically like a 4 months FD (cash credit depends on how much you earmarked). However  according to this chat message:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/115771seems like you are also earning the UOB One up to 5% Interest (assuming you are using UOB One Savings account). So the Cash Credit + 5% interest is very good rate.,btohqsg

Hi everyone  I have $10 000 with me and I am not sure what can I do with it. Any recommendations?,btohqsg
Yes  while not explicitly mentioned  it seems like as if the amount that I earmarked in my UOB One account can also be earning the UOB One bonus interest concurrently with the UOB National Savings promo!,btohqsg

$10k just nice for moomoo welcome offer +5.8% p.a. returnhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/117075,btohqsg
Hmm what’s the 5.8% interest thing?,btohqsg
Hi for the SMART Park 30-day 5.8% return  if I deposit on 30th August and hold it  do I get 5.8% daily until 29th September?,btohqsg
He say you all don’t know one la 😂 but nope not listening to him.,btohqsg
Yes  30 day starts from your deposit date,btohqsg
if u signed up for that  its 0.058 * 10 000 * (30/365) if i got the formula correct,btohqsg
only through the transaction history then can see if really got enrolled into smart park?,btohqsg
better not listen to ur friend 😂,btohqsg
I will test out smart park myself over the week then comment,btohqsg
Does this mean if i deposit 10k with 5 buy trades and hold for 30 days i will get all the 3 rewards?,btohqsg
I think somebody shared before. Moomoo ways of handling the promo is you need to click the coupon before depositing your money. Or else you can’t earn the rewards.,btohqsg
Yes  for a new to moomoo user,btohqsg

Maribank only 2.5%. I rather use SIF GoSavers which is 2.5% min but got higher tier interest,btohqsg
i only sign up maribank for fun since only though invitations,btohqsg
Uob lady bonus point is in for me for jul spending,btohqsg
Lol if you had that much cash to hit the higher tiers  there are much better privilege/ priority/ private banking options out thereLike if you put $200k in SIF GoSavers its effective 2.75% pa (2.5% first 100k  3.0% next 100k)$200k in UOB Privilege is a 3.50% flat for all $200k (without promo),btohqsg
Hi  is citipayall count under new comer clocking?,btohqsg
Hi guys...im new here...just wanna ask u guys...im new to scb credit card...can i know how to withdraw cash from scb atm or other atm such as posb or uob or ocbc???,btohqsg
U will incur high interest cash advance rate and fee if u withdraw cash from any atm with your credit card,btohqsg
It does not count under new to bank user spending criteria.,btohqsg
Lets say i withdraw 500 around how much i need to pay back??,btohqsg
U will need to see the card fee and charges and i dont think it is a good way to get 500 via cash advance unless it is your last options,btohqsg
But how to withdraw cash at the first place?? I tried but cant...,btohqsg
U need to have available credit limit with credit card  any atm should be able withdraw but u need the pin that bank send u,btohqsg
Already change my own pin...a 5 digit pin...,btohqsg
But atm should have 6 digit pin right??,btohqsg
But y they ask to change a 5 digit pin,btohqsg
There is alot of charges in the small print  please know what u are getting into before doing cash advance. If u hold a mastercard  as long as they havr the mastercard logo u can withdraw. Same goes to visa card  as long as atm have visa logo u can withdraw,btohqsg
The interest start kick in from the moment u withdraw it can range from 25 percent to 30 percent per annum range  compound daily i think. Do read your card term and condition.,btohqsg
Where you get this info? Can share with me?,btohqsg
Sign up for1) Cash Plus AccountOr2) Cash Management AccountNo harm to sign up for allFacilities?,btohqsg
Better to sign up for Cash Management. Cash Plus got inactivity fee $15/quarter,btohqsg

When do I get credited for the uob one interest ?,btohqsg
I think not yet. Maybe later part of the day,btohqsg
Hi all  july is my first month using UOB one account. I had full 100k from 1-31 July  and fulfilled both salary + $500 spend. Any idea why I only got $420.62 bonus int + $4.25 base int?,btohqsg
Interest is calculated daily not monthly. Jul has 31 days.$100k x 5% x (31/365),btohqsg
My bad  I thought 5% EIR = $500 interest in a month. Haven’t woke up properly. Thank you!!,btohqsg
Hi  May I check  my UOB one account. Only receive these 2 interest. Will there be more interest?,btohqsg
Hi  May I check  u receive how many interest deposit? I only got 2 lines of interest deposit.,btohqsg
Just watched this video. I’m also one of them who bought Lion Global S&P 500 back then. As of now I have unrealised gain of 5%.Should withdraw all my existing Lion Global back to CPF then DCA to Amundi Prime USD Fund? Or should I do one lum then continue DCA?,btohqsg
Oh no. Why mine so low only. 🥲 I have around 90+ k in there.,btohqsg
Not 100k won't get full 5% interest.,btohqsg
Yes 2 lines as per your screenshot,btohqsg
5% per month is ah long’s rate🤣,btohqsg
May I check also  when will uob release back the 50k to my balance? I signed up this uob one account and got the $250 bonus. But dunno why the bank “capped” away my 50k.,btohqsg
I think other got mention before,btohqsg
Earmarked for 4 months. Assuming yours is the July-Sep cycle,btohqsg
I see. Thanks a lot. So the 50k will only release around Sep-Oct period?And  so this 50k will be considered into my monthly average balance too?,btohqsg
hello fellow money savers...what will be the most optimal approach for a big ticket overseas spending to earn the most miles? (E.g >$10k spending)I was thinking: AMAZE -- OCBC Titanium rewardsLow FX rate + 4MPD?Is my approach correct? Or are there any better options?,btohqsg
Morning sifu...Now DBS revised their perks for booking airline. no more 1 $ = 3 miles.May i know what other card can i use?,btohqsg
UOB lady card with travel category.... 6mpd no fight,btohqsg
"haha that one stuck under ""dining"" lol",btohqsg
Ocbc tr is only for certain mcc  please check it before use. Uob vs give 4mp up to 2k spending but there is foreign currency charges.,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc up to 2k spending or uob krisflyer i thinj,btohqsg
but doesnt amaze transactions count as online spending?and OCBC Titanium gives 4MPD for online spending?,btohqsg
i just deposited into poems as well  got the same display as yours.wondering does this mean smart park is working and 30 day starts now?,btohqsg
No  it is mcc related still,btohqsg
Thanks Sifus... Sian.. attitude capped at 5k.. just nicefor my SQ,btohqsg
hmm then which card will you recommend to both enjoy AMAZE low FX + reap credit card miles benefit?,btohqsg
The thing about UOB KF  is that for travel it's restricted not by MCCs however. So only some airlines/platforms may apply,btohqsg
On Philip MyWealth app  my enets cash deposit is reflected in my live cash balances  but the Smart Park screen shows 0 value. Perhaps need to wait a while before they will deploy my cash into the smart park,btohqsg
U need to spend 800 on sia or scoot or krisshop first  the bonus miles also only credit after the anniversary and u might not be able to waive off the annual fee.I cancelled and uob kf coz they insisted me to pay annual fee and i end up cancel and forfeit all bonus point,btohqsg
wa okay..means the miles will not come in so quickly,btohqsg
Ouch. that hurt.. hope is not alot of points,btohqsg
unless you using on SIA group (3mpd directly on next statement month),btohqsg
else  1.8mpd comes in 2 months after AF,btohqsg
That is ok  learn lesson loh. I can earn miles on other good card haha.,btohqsg
Does that mean directly buy air ticket from Malaysia airlines  Cathay Pacific  etc…. Will not qualify for 3mpd under UOB Krisflyer?,btohqsg
yep. Will be funny if they did given it's a co-brand card 😂,btohqsg
Apart from that I think got no other high mpd Mastercard that can pair to amaze alr for travel spends lol,btohqsg
"seems like DBS World 4 miles per $ for ""online""later i call them to double confirm SQ.. before i  use",btohqsg
so just to confirm my understanding shifus...say i wanna buy a $10k product in Japan.Using AMAZE-UOB KF...12k miles upfrontbalance 18k miles will come in later within the next 12months?,btohqsg
point expiry 1 year - DBS.. waliao..,btohqsg
I enrolled Hsbc EGA in March for that 4 months high interest promo. It’s already August and I haven’t received interest for this account. Does anyone has datapoint for this? Hope hsbc does not con people into putting large sums $$ into their bank and don’t pay interest 😅😅,btohqsg
Mcc must still fall under the bonus cat  japan merchent often give funny mcc,btohqsg
but im spending through amaze no?,btohqsg
Please read the chart ppl shared earlier,btohqsg
wouldnt the bonus cat count under AMAZE? and not the japan merchant?,btohqsg
ah okay... i see i see. got it liao. still dependent on the MCC regardless whether using AMAZE not,btohqsg
terms and conditions stated by end Aug if I recall correctly.,btohqsg
Amaze only convert it to online transaction  underlying mcc still apply,btohqsg
Transactions are still marked as amaze. Lots of cards nerfed their promotions for amaze transactions,btohqsg
are klook purchases excluded from crmc?,btohqsg
This question is a bit tricky. How you buy the Japan product? What is the product? That decides if it is qualified 3mpd.,btohqsg
sorry one more noob question. anywhere i can find out what MCC represents?,btohqsg
its ok we are here to learn. Merchants generally dont publish MCC or are willing to share but you can find a merchant (or shop) MCCusingheymax.aiwebsiteMCC = Merchant Category Code,btohqsg
Heymax is for visa mcc  mastercard might allocated mcc slightly different,btohqsg
Some Japan merchants do not follow what displayed by Heymax which is international standard.,btohqsg
looking at buying a watch from those reseller shops. haha,btohqsg
Heymax is also not 100 percent accurate  take it with a pinch of salt.,btohqsg
Most accurate is use the dbs method. Block the card  pay then use the digibot to verify,btohqsg
My 2 concerns:1). You buy watch from shops in Japan  which I personal believe  does not fall under any of UOB Krisflyer categories.2). For those transactions(eg. Dining) that falls within category  you need to worry about their non standard mcc code that not qualified under UOB KF. This usually happens in Japan.,btohqsg
Correct - Watch Stores MCC don't.,btohqsg
@OldAhPekSuggest to use this method to check the mcc code first in Japan before making actual payment. If the mcc code “jump” into the qualified category  then you can hurray.,btohqsg
anyone knows of travel insurance which offer claims below 6 hours flight delay?,btohqsg
Or since u buying in store. Cn just use cmrc amaze for first 1k.,btohqsg
Can just edit the portfolio to 100% amundi  then it wont go back to cpf. Contact endowus for the step by step,btohqsg

Hi guys so with my maybank FNF card if lets say I buy from NTUC  Redmart and the MCC is eligible for 8% cashback  if I pair with Amaze the same MCC will be used right? and I will still be eligible for 8% cashback,btohqsg
Yes. But u can just use the card direct also get 8% no extra benefits for using amaze for local spend on fnf,btohqsg
oh so there is no additional benefit to pair amaze with fnf ?,btohqsg
Local spend no extra benefits if use overseas u get a better exchange rates than the bank lo and the instapoints,btohqsg
oh wow I had no idea on that ! easier to just use fnf directly then haha,btohqsg
Actually if lock up 10k  you lose about $300 in interest per year on opportunity cost.If you do enough 4NF to recoup the $300 and annual fee then maybe make sense,btohqsg
ohhh UNLESS!! I go and spend in malaysia and pair it with fnf  then I will get 8% cashback + good exchange rate. right!? lol,btohqsg
Amaze + Credit card has 3 main features :1). Convert transactions from offline to online2). Prefix the transaction description with “AMAZE…….”.With this  some credit cards exclude the rewards. eg  UOB KF exclude Amaze from OTA travel related.3). Reduce the foreign currency spread.,btohqsg
It's not good rates . Better rates than banks but still higher than trust youtrip etc,btohqsg
"Haha not sure if #2 is a ""feature""...",btohqsg

Am going to make overseas spend on Hotel and am thinking which way is best for this with the current cards I have. Unfortunately I don't have UOB Ladies or Citirewards card atm,btohqsg
It depends on how you see things. For non-promotional pricing for US stocks and ETFs  I am using IBKR because I DCA  for eg  USD 100 and the fee is only 0.38 USD  for fractional trading. Other brokers charged more after their promotional price are over. IBKR can access Iondon stock ex so that is also an advantage over other brokers.Syfe offers 2 free us trade per month which is pretty good too.,btohqsg

Hello! Can I seek help as to how I can apply for the SEP status so that I can do VC3A to enjoy the tax relief? I was previously employed by a company from Jan-Jun and I am looking to change my employment status to self employed as I work based on commissions so I can top up more to my CPF to enjoy tax relief,btohqsg
Can watch this video for SEP CPFhttps://youtu.be/9BE-3QaOc7k,btohqsg
I did watch it but I'm still confused as I am required to report my NTI either on CPF or IRAS. However  my salary for Jul-Dec 2023 has yet to come in so I have nothing to report yet. If I were to wait till next year  I would then miss the window to do my VC3A for 2023😞,btohqsg
I think your situation is best to check with CPF board and IRAS for official answers  as not many will have the same situation,btohqsg
I checked with them but they only provided me generic answers😞 Can I check with you  that for Y0  is it true that you are not eligible for any CPF contri??',btohqsg
For Y0 i earned less than 6000  so no point to VC3A anyway. But on the safe side  i assume if you are not registered as SEP (until Y1 next year)  you wont be eligible for VC3A tax relief,btohqsg
is it possible if i reported Y2022 income as 0 so Y2023 can become my first year of SEP?,btohqsg
You should report whenever income is recognized for the Financial year  not based on how you want to maximize tax relief,btohqsg

Hi all! if I were to use my Amaze Card overseas  other than Citi Rewards card  are there other card recommendations that would be worth it compared to Trust/Youtrip?,btohqsg
Chris. Seen your videos on amaze vs trust. I think it’s really a use case problem.If you are stacking to redeem sq suites with cmrc then the forex bank fees and online category more than offset the 2% amaze fee.If for general use outside of cmrc then it’s a problem. In isolation when compared to trust YouTrip the fee is essentially 2% more but you get card points and cash back benefits. So for example the 1.5% cash back cards like sc you actually lose 0.5% compared to trust.,btohqsg

Of course  no denying that. Use amaze with at least 4 mpd/5% cashback card,btohqsg
But even then use without amaze you only lose 1% forex fees?,btohqsg

"hi everyone  i'm new to the miles game so wanted to seek some opinions on signing up for my first miles card. i understand that at 6mpd for selected categories  the uob lady's card has been touted as the best miles card in singapore at least until the 6mpd promotion ends in feb next year. i saw that Chris mentioned in his uob lady's card video a few weeks ago that for new-to-uob customers (like myself)  we should apply for the uob privi miles card first instead to make use of the free miles they are giving away if the conditions are met (from the website  looks like 45 200 miles if can spend 1k per month for 2 consecutive months + pay the first year annual fee payment of S$240+8% gst).i'm considering just going to sign up for the uob lady's solitaire card straightaway as this has a $350 cash credit sign-up bonus if i fulfil the same 1k per month spending criteria for 2 consecutive months. was just doing the calculations and if i value the miles at 1.25cents per mile  the 45 200 miles from the privi miles card sign-up bonus is worth about $565. but considering i have to pay the $240 annual fee + forgo the $350 cash bonus from the uob lady's card (total about $590)  the case to get the 45 200 miles doesn't seem as strong?i also have some travel expenses to pay off soon for a year-end trip (but not super alot  probably just under 2k) so i thought good to rack up the miles with the 6mpd uob lady's card first / as soon as i can? assuming i choose the ""travel"" category for the enhanced miles accrual for the uob lady's card.do let me know if i am missing something here or if there's something i should be aware of. thank you very much!!",btohqsg

How much Salary do you need to Afford your First Homehttps://youtu.be/w2Q65_b0c7k,btohqsg
1) If you want to use UOB one to earn higher interest  don’t use it for your other daily transactions. Use less number of transactions as possible.2). Any new transactions credited in  transfer it out by end of the day.3). Make the day end balance a constant amount . Eg. $100k.4). Interest is calculated daily not monthly. Jul has 31 days.Eg. Assuming your day end balance is $100k throughout Jul  then$100k x 5% x (31/365),btohqsg

Hi  just a question any idea why UOB still need 3mth payslip even after providing a $10k deposit application for secured credit card?,btohqsg
They didn’t ask when my mom applied though.,btohqsg
Your understanding and calculation has problem. Max is $100k per day of saving to be included in the calculation. Even if u have $100k in UOB one account for the whole month  the maximum interest you can get is $424.66 in Jul.,btohqsg
makes no sense at all why i need to even though i have a collateral already,btohqsg
Well u need to at least show u are earning money before u can save money?,btohqsg
This was referring to the avg balance  not the interest.It’s fine  thank you for all the advise!!,btohqsg
but my income does not hit the min threshold of $30k,btohqsg
Ok. UOB interest is by tier. It range 3.85% to 7.8% if you did not hit $100k. Not fixed at 5%If your saving is not hitting $100k every day  then you need to calculate the interest by day based on your tier.,btohqsg
I guess no harm giving the payslip since u are going through secured route.,btohqsg
not really max $100k per day  it is based on avarage daily balance  can have more than $100k on some days,btohqsg
Also need to see if you have meet salary credit or using 3 GIRO. Both using different interest rate n tier to calculate.,btohqsg
Hi guys. Whats the best place for investment for long term plan with highest return and is the safest. Looking to put aside $800 - $1000 every month.,btohqsg
will i be able to do that as an 20 year old?,btohqsg
as long as 18 can le for SSB,btohqsg
What the tbill rate ah today,btohqsg
Yea. I concur. The bonus interest is calculated at the end of the month  based on ADB of that month.I used to think the same as MH but i never get the correct amount. Changing to the above ☝️ makes my calculation tally with what i actually get.TLDR: u can put more than 100k a day to make up for any shortfall during the month,btohqsg
So uob one interest is calculated daily? Using MAB? can explain pls? 😔,btohqsg
You try to use MAB to calculate first to see it works for your account. As the daily balance in my UOB one account remains the same amount throughout the whole month  I can’t verify.,btohqsg
Bro and sis for EvolIs there tricks to convert spendings to online spend?,btohqsg

Will DCS ultimate platinum mastercard work with cardup?,btohqsg
Oh  the interest is daily  not counted MAB ar  so even if 1 day I 90k  the next day 110K  also useless to make up 100K?,btohqsg
Somebody try to use this MAB method to calculate  but cannot get the amount/interest correct  hence  I will suggest you to use this method to check yours. I can’t confirm on this as the balance on my account remains the same throughout the month.,btohqsg
I believe bonus interest is computed on MAB? I.e. if u r short of 100k  u can top up on later days to get the mab to 100k?,btohqsg
This is what I thought also but someone just can’t get the amount correct using this method.I know for OCBC  MAB method works.,btohqsg
Yup  mine can't tally  I did not pay attention till saw the post.. Still tot can make it,btohqsg
no lah  evol cannot use with Amaze cos it is not mastercard,btohqsg
Oh oops I didn't read evol hahah,btohqsg

Can I check on iPhone does Fave and Shopback give the underlying credit card reward point?,btohqsg
you are right. let me put an end to this confusion. UOB interest is computed based on monthly average daily balance  same as OCBC 360.,btohqsg
so if you accidentally put in too much money and you realise before month end  you can transfer out to try to bring down the average to 100K.,btohqsg
Are there any methods to withdraw foreign currency from ATM with youtrip without having to pay such high fees. Previously their fee was $5 per withdrawal. Now is at 2%.Only idea is to get multiple account under youtrip and make use of their fee free first $400 withdrawal per month.,btohqsg
Has anyone received the email from prosperus for reward redemption?,btohqsg
Issue being I have already dump 2k inside tha card back in Feb when the rate was supposedly high at 104jpy,btohqsg
Then just withdraw $400 and swipe card for the rest of ur 1.6kMastercard shld be widely accepted in JP,btohqsg
Is $400 cash enough? One issue with the need for cash is for transportation. With the IC card discontinued for Tokyo. And the digital IC only available for iPhone and top-up only available for cards on apple pay. Youtrip does not support apple pay currently. So for transportation the IC card need to be top up with cash at the kiosk. I do have a physical IC card from when I last visited in 2015.,btohqsg
This is why dont use youtrip your money stuck inside unless u willing to just withdraw with the extra charges. Other card can store foreign currencies are better since u can withdraw or transfer out also. If not use trust or amaze with good cc will be the best,btohqsg
Now some transport can tap visa or mastercard in japan like simplygo in sg. Alot of have change in jap since covid. Card acceptance is so much more after covid,btohqsg
My 1st n 2nd mth with uob one. As i deposited fund at different days of the month  my interest is pro rated according to the interest tiers and number of days. I roughly calculated and total received is rather closed.,btohqsg

Ok but can I transfer money from youtrip to revolut?,btohqsg
I booked a hotel on agoda last night and used shopback 11% cashback  however the actualy payment of the hotel will only be made in october. will shopback trigger the cashback calculation based on the booking date (11%) or payment date (in OCT  prob lower amount)?,btohqsg
Don’t think you can. Need same platform  ie YouTrip to YouTrip  Revolut to Revolut. Japan IC card is much more convenient than CC. Some machine still need to slot in. Not all machine accept paywave.,btohqsg
hi is there any recommendation re which uob privi card variant to get? ie visa  Mastercard or amex. or not much difference? (probably not amex since not as commonly accepted compared to visa/mastercard?),btohqsg
actually what u using uob prvi for?,btohqsg
probably just to get the sign up bonus. After that.. will probably get the uob ladys solitaire and another 4mpd card so wont rly have much use for the prvi after that,btohqsg
think get mastercard in case want to use with Amaze for foreign/cross border spend,btohqsg
For UOB stash account  do you folks withdraw the interests the same day it's credited?This is to prevent the interests amount from being included in the day's closing balance  and thus affects the MAB.,btohqsg
on UOB National Day Savings promotion - after we submit the participation form  we have to wait for confirmation from UOB before transfering in the funds right?,btohqsg
u should have received an email with instructions,btohqsg
same as me.. im using prvi now in the second month for this exact purpose. im using MC for the prvi so that i can easily pair with amaze and switch around once i hit the 1k requirement,btohqsg
did you get that email on a Friday?,btohqsg
i only got an email stating that the email is an acknowledgement but not a confirmation of my participation,btohqsg
thanks trazora and Joshua.i understand that for the prvi card  there's 2.4 mpd for overseas spending. i suppose if you use amaze to convert the spending into sgd  it will be considered local spending and clock the usual 1.4 mpd rate?,btohqsg
yes that email will also state what you should do next.. Just follow that email and you should be all good.second paragraph is what u should look at,btohqsg

so we have to deposit the money first  then hopefully we will be chosen for the promotion?,btohqsg
you could say that. But you are already earning interest when u deposit the funds  so there is no loss even 'if you are not successful'i don't believe there is any reason for UOB not to allow you to participate unless you key in wrong details or what.the easiest way to know if you are 'successful' is when u see your available balance drop by the earmarked amount.remember the time frames  the earlier u take part  the earlier your earmark ends..,btohqsg
No more video on moomoo 5.8%  changed to article form. But if any questions  feel free to comment,btohqsg

Not favourable as I credited my salary to uob and spending not much too,btohqsg
It also depends on your age range  size of your investible portfolio and where they are currently allocated,btohqsg
If u are v conservative  sg t bills  FD  uob one/ocbc 360. If more adventurous  can try usd money market funds. If u want to start investing in stocks  u can target an ETF first to test water.,btohqsg
Thanks David. I not confidence of stocks and ETF at the moment thus I put my money in FD. I reading on the ETF and watched a few YouTubers recommending a few promising ETF counters. Will study more before asking this group,btohqsg

Getting the insurance and Investment. Uob one has slightly better bonus interest than ocbc,btohqsg
For overseas spending can i use amaze + womens world? Then can spend up to 2k for 4mpd?,btohqsg

Is it possible to transfer OA to MA?,btohqsg
Your calculations may be wrong for exchange rate  but if you factor in the rewards and fees  you'll get a net profit with amaze+citirewards.,btohqsg

Similar to GxS in the beginning  no one knows lol. But I assume you have to be an active user of Shopee?

If have extra fund this month  can aim for those 1-month promo 5.8% instead of Maribank 2.5%.,btohqsg

At 1st glance  Imo  i do not think they've got same mCC  as taka is a dept store whereas Starbucks could be under dining?,btohqsg
Does anybody know HL Bank I saving account fall below amount ?,btohqsg
I mean topup gift card at Starbucks will have similar mcc with order drink at Starbucks,btohqsg
if you top up at the counter instead of via the app  it might be treated like buying drinks,btohqsg
this is why if using card like ocbc360 with extra cashback for food  better to top up Starbuck card at counter instead of via app.,btohqsg
Instarem + Lady card can count as dining overseas right?Thanks for helping to whoever 😆,btohqsg
hi  for a card to complement uob ladys card (i.e. for spending outside the 1 or 2 chosen categories for increased miles)  is there any big advantage for using instarem+citi rewards as compared to say hsbc revolution? do people prefer instarem+citi rewards because practically all transactions (other than travel related) can qualify for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hey  im not sure this is the right place but I’m seeking advice for university. I’ve got an offer for a place in SUTD but the tuition fee is really high ( about 13.5k + 2k dorms). I’m thinking for trying to apply for scholarship but if I don’t get it  I would have to take a loan.So I would like to ask  is it better to get the degree while incurring a student loan or is it better to start working with my diploma and get a part time degree?,btohqsg
Time is of essence. If you can take a student loan at 0% or lower than mkt rate  go for it :) I believe there is a scheme where the actual loan rate will only kick in when you start working,btohqsg
I see  but I’ve been seeing a lot of videos on financial literacy  and having student loan is one of the biggest liabilities. Is a degree worth putting myself into debt or is using that money to build assets better?,btohqsg
I'd advise to go look for bursaries  scholarships online and apply for them... There are education loans that do not charge interest during the course of study/duration of loan  and u can start paying for it after u get a job/graduation....If all else fails  seek advice from sutd student affairs ctr....It's not everyone and everyday that ppl get offers for uni placement...,btohqsg
Your words already tell me you are prioritizing earning money over the purpose of your education which is supposed to help you in your career advancement which will lead to financial gains later on?,btohqsg
Yup I’ve been looking around  and eyeing the scholarship offer by the school actually  as it has no bonds  just require good grades   and 20 hrs of community service. But just like all scholarships I might not get it,btohqsg
Nv try nv know  just do it ..... Just be aware of t&Cs of each scholarships and ask as many qns as u need abt them....,btohqsg
Having a degree can also be a great asset. It’s what you do during the degree course and after that decides whether the loan is really a liability or the degree is an asset.In the end you want your degree to increase your income.If you think the degree work increase your income  e.g. your work experience in lieu of your degree would increase income more  then degree May not be what u want.I’ve got a friend that went to a top 5 JC  didn’t do a degree in the end  but started a restaurant. Now he earns quite a fair bit and has a few restaurants,btohqsg
Well that’s one of the reasons. The other reason is that my sister is also attending uni around the same time as me  and I could take part time to support my family first. (I’d say I’m in the lower SES class),btohqsg
Well  no one is saying u can't work part time while you're studying full time ...It's taxing and tiring  for sure  and I dk fully ur family situation... So do what u deem fit....,btohqsg
Ah ok. Well that’s the dilemma I’m in right now. I’ve been asking around  but there’s alot of mix views  so I’m not really sure.,btohqsg
Yeah I’ve been thinking about that too but I’m scared it might affect my grades,btohqsg
Study part time while working full time  oso has its pros n cons ....,btohqsg
Good morning senior.I am still using grab paylater. And I need to top up/pay for it.What is the best way to do it?Thank you 🙏,btohqsg
Choose 1 and make sure u make it work.... I'd say go study while u still young n have the energy....,btohqsg
Mm ok  thanks for your insight 🙏,btohqsg
Every life decision is yours to make.If you already have a goal and want to work towards it. That doesn’t need a degree then don’t do it. I’ve seen some property agents/ financial advisors without a degree but work on other skillset  doing much better in terms of financial standing compared to degree holders.Most important is your attitude in life.,btohqsg
