Mine 24 inch + 27 inch. Both under $300,btohqsg
The last two were none gaming specs?,btohqsg
graphics card need to be able to support the higher refresh rate of gaming monitors,btohqsg
then PC needs to be fast enough to support the faster refresh.Then the gaming monitor makes sense,btohqsg

Meanwhile i had lesson at 0930 and i just woke up 15 mins ago,btohqsg

I heard that was the case during my year,btohqsg
I think for MI 88-89 is so rare that they lower that expectation to just >80,btohqsg
so is it ‚Äúis‚Äù or ‚Äúwas‚Äù,btohqsg
cuz i havent got the call yet,btohqsg
im at the brink of cryingnrn,btohqsg

All the best to those getting their results today!!,btohqsg
how is ur mt on avg?,btohqsg
bc a 'good grade' is different for everyone,btohqsg
tbvh whether a 'C' is good or not is for u to decide,btohqsg
Honestly mother tongue imo is either you are already smart enough to get A for it  or dont even bother trying,btohqsg
Because if iirc only A gives you the +1.25rp extra isnt it?,btohqsg
what u get for national exams is +1 or -1 grade from ur avg sch based exam grade,btohqsg
like for chinese i normally get A1-B3 in sch and i got A2 in the end for Os,btohqsg
Only if it helps u I think,btohqsg
and if u are taking ur chinese grade into account,btohqsg
But ya generally I heard it only +1 rp IF u get A,btohqsg
Then ofc Ur cl need a standard,btohqsg
AFAIK u clear the uni req all G,btohqsg
3 in 10 is that what u trying to say?,btohqsg
Ironically i think jc chinese is much easier than Os,btohqsg
Ok la I j1 tho so I can't say much abt that,btohqsg
But my ass was only focused on passing,btohqsg
literally the same situation as u,btohqsg
is it? i'd love to try jc chinese!,btohqsg
But ya aft this rly need focus on Ur other subjs,btohqsg
Doesnt have the cancerous ÁªºÂêà thingy from Os,btohqsg
I haven't experience JC cl yet,btohqsg
But my group memed the lecturer we damn mean oneüò≠,btohqsg
But only essay sect I think,btohqsg
i rly love jc chinese and cll but the other subjects stop me so i gave up the idea of even gg jc,btohqsg
U will take the written as 1 paper,btohqsg
I dont remember how i got through summary but its definitely not as brain wracking as zong he tian kong,btohqsg
Then aft that got admin break can't do anyth,btohqsg
Then aft that can't use calc for remaining 1.5hr,btohqsg
Okay actually zong he tian kong is not brain wrecking tbh because i dont even try :( cant do what i cant read,btohqsg
I do too much math HW alrd....,btohqsg
Admittedly one of the 7/10 people who cant chinese in my life and just want to pass cl because its a requirement,btohqsg
But i do like jamming to jay chou and jj lin,btohqsg
anyone with A lvl score out alr :],btohqsg

My next week is stacked sia cc3 debate  cc5 presentation  phy mid terms  bde mid terms and lab report submission,btohqsg
I dont need A+ can help me get B+?:'),btohqsg
got cc2 writing service aso anot,btohqsg
Ayo cc2 is quite chillz ngl,btohqsg
I took 2 days just to write a 500 words assignment for cc1,btohqsg
Good luck to me for the op-ed,btohqsg
I kinda wanna anyhow zam but,btohqsg
At the same time write decent enough to get at least B+,btohqsg
I shall learn from the best,btohqsg
glhf to all y'all taking a lvl results,btohqsg
Isnt that the stupid useless descriptive writing mod that waste time,btohqsg
The whole ICC is basically described by your last 3 words,btohqsg
Never thought id need to visit descriptive writing again after O levels,btohqsg
Ye but at least for the others I can follow the rubrics,btohqsg
So far I did cc3 and cc5,btohqsg
Worst still is I have a class every friday for cc1,btohqsg
And its the only class that day,btohqsg
So Im dragging myself to sch every friday just for cc1,btohqsg
That used to be cc2 for me last sem,btohqsg
That means almost half the cohort got 90rp,btohqsg
afaik vj standard has been dropping over the years,btohqsg
rj hc op moe nerf pls,btohqsg
Fk man my heart gonna literally explode,btohqsg
Lol the whole point of icc is to make u interdiscplinary but I feel the classes are very fluffy,btohqsg
No news means it‚Äôs good news right?,btohqsg
Apparently icc mods pull up the average gpa,btohqsg
U cs? Too bad bozo wlc back to gp which is 2 au btw,btohqsg
Whats the point of that if they just go through a lot of things at the surface level though,btohqsg
It pulls down ppl who can score higher,btohqsg
And even if they go through more indept  it will eat more time away from the core mods,btohqsg
Cum lord to no cum lord,btohqsg
wah jp median same as vj,btohqsg
It pulls up lower performers and pulls down top performers,btohqsg
Technically ICC (cc3 and cc5) pulled me up,btohqsg
Even tho I would argue I did well last sem,btohqsg
wah jpjc median higher than asr??,btohqsg
But cc1 will be my first B-,btohqsg
Low tier jc did better than high tier,btohqsg
What was their median last yr?,btohqsg
ppl alw treat them as low tier for some reason,btohqsg
Huh wait wut happened to vj,btohqsg
Tm mean is like 73. Smth? I think that's what the broadcast show,btohqsg
hasnt it alw been about there,btohqsg
Hvnt ri and hci being ard there for many yr alr,btohqsg
half the cohort gets 88.75 or 90,btohqsg
Every yr also 88 87.5 ish no,btohqsg
The results are on Reddit already??,btohqsg
I dun rmbr? But roughly no?,btohqsg
i wld expect 88.75 to be only slightly fewer than 90,btohqsg
cos got ppl die to gp/econs,btohqsg
88 median is 88.75 or 87.5??,btohqsg
VJ 6 in 10 got distinction in Econs,btohqsg
but even mean 84.4 q low for ri,btohqsg
Median of 88 yet mean of 84,btohqsg
Shows that those that don‚Äôt do well do really bloody badly,btohqsg
