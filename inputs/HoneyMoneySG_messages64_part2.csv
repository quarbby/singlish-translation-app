My understanding base on tableTier 11.5% is the whatever balance of the monthTier 22.5% is the fund balance - aug balanceExampleIf your aug balance is zero. Then u put 20k fresh fund on 1 sepTier 1 - 20k X 1.5%Tier 2 - 20k - $0 (aug) x2.5%Effective is 3.5% p.aIt will repeat for next 6 months and I didn't draw up my 20k,btohqsg

I got my CRMC approved on 31st Aug  but CBS website said no record found when I tried accessing earlier. Based on statement 1  it should be available after 16th Sep right?,btohqsg
How come higher return when both 3.7%?,btohqsg
If put 350k  then will get $1k credit into ocbc credit card. This is on top of the 3.7%. So overall is higher returns.To compare against Tbill  let say put 350k in ocbc for 180days1000/180*365/350000= 0.579%3.7 + 0.579 = 4.2579%,btohqsg
I come here to ask if any other deal better than this? 😂,btohqsg

I found this website is quite useful. Many people benefits from it. You can try to search usinghttps://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Not every bank will query cbs,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword “Check category lady uob” to search chat history related to this query to see what other reply.,btohqsg
Alternatively you can search “UOB Lady FAQ”,btohqsg
Thanks for the tips! Under FAQ it says call CSO and I tried calling 30mins still can't talk to a live agent 😂,btohqsg

Hi experts Question for the xnap users  the interface is quite confusing as to pay 5sgd for example  it's going to show 0 05 (i remember paying 500sgd instead of 5sgd for my first transaction lol). How do you pay 4.7sgd ? As it will show 0 47 which is 47sgd.,btohqsg
"Hi all... jus wonder if anybody knows what criteria defines ""new to bank"" when signing up for new credit card? I am getting a new UOB LADY'S card and i m holding EVOL for more than a year... so will that define a new to bank status? Under other banks like DBS and CITIBANK has this criteria...",btohqsg
New to UOB credit means you are an actual fresh UOB customer or cancelled your last UOB card for at least 6 months.,btohqsg
Hi all may I ask if OCBC Titanium Rewards Credit Card is a good card? What's the disadvantages?,btohqsg
