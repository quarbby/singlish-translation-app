expecting the other person to just drop their handle is the same thing,btohqsg
asking for a request is literally how alot of miscoms happen in sales for example,btohqsg
no but its the way of communication,btohqsg
you cant just randomly ask someone on the spot to answer something they dont expect,btohqsg
that's only bc of the kind of society we are in,btohqsg
it's not a matter of the question,btohqsg
by the kind of society  i mean like sg,btohqsg
yes the question itself is not the prob but its the way how communication is established is the issue,btohqsg
you can literally ask anything but as long as the way you first establish communication creates tension..you alr ended the convo,btohqsg
my issue is that one side can be more careful to not put the person on the spot  while the other has to respond properly as well,btohqsg
you can't expect someone to start it a certain way and not know how to deal with it otherwise,btohqsg
how can someone not know how to react when they are given information...they literally either follow through or ignore. there is no basis that will give them any other choices,btohqsg
In sg I think random conversations with strangers aren't common and so it raises alarm instead of receiving it nicely,btohqsg
that's part of my point lol,btohqsg
you can't make blanket statements about the entire thing,btohqsg
they are common  just not for youths,btohqsg
Either ways u are also emphasising contextual discretion when it comes to such occurrences. There is and would be no fully correct action and what he did per say wasn't illegal or rise to the standard of a reportable action,btohqsg
the elderly have no prob doing that..thats why they can easily interact with other elderlies no issues,btohqsg
i think it's foolish to just assume there's always a specific way one should act,btohqsg
and a specific way you should start this sort of convo,btohqsg
so its not sg context..its a generational context,btohqsg
that is basically what im saying,btohqsg
Some places have it worse imo. The US has a culture of random cat calling of woman which I personally find deplorable,btohqsg
Does it rise to an illegal action,btohqsg
because if you realise..verbal threats in the US are mostly not followed through at all,btohqsg
that is the byproduct of free speech,btohqsg
it does not matter the threats are aimed at who...they are almost never follow through by authorities..you can have a guy threatening verbally a women  a employee threatening a boss  a kid threatening a teacher..etc  nothing happens,btohqsg
Yeah.. I won't trust that especially with a place that had access to guns like candy in a toy store.,btohqsg
yea idk i heard up until recently they sold shotguns at walmarts,btohqsg
i think the concept of shooting one's shot is just lost when you make blanket statements comparing it to sales lol,btohqsg
it really depends on how you approach the stranger and what tone/intention you have though,btohqsg
ive had strangers talk to me just cos of my shirt,btohqsg
Yeah sales has a clear economic motive to it,btohqsg
It is not an apples to apples comparison for that.,btohqsg
I have had ppl walk up to me and just commented on my height very common tbh,btohqsg
i alr mentioned its not about what is talked about..its how its conversed. sales  marketing..customer/employee. you can apply the same method of communication anywhere and it wont fly.elderlies cant bring the same communication from other elderlies to a sales person for example. my example of sales was just to show that its all the same kinds of communication starter,btohqsg
how you deliver + the content of what you say,btohqsg
so you are saying that a elderly acting aggressive and pushy towards another elderly will receive the same reaction as them acting aggressive and pushy towards a sales person,btohqsg
if you approached a girl nicely to compliment her and be cute about it i'm sure she'll be happy but if you do it with a weird inflection and language she'll pickup on that,btohqsg
Sales is an entirely different context and reason for conversation that makes it incompatible as a comparison.,btohqsg
casual conversation is not the same as sales dawg,btohqsg
why do i need a context or reason...when i can literally replace sales with anything else,btohqsg
from your ig i can't tell if you're surviving well,btohqsg
how many people trying to sell you something on the street do you ignore,btohqsg
If I am not doing intern with other styff,btohqsg
how many strangers that approach you do you ignore,btohqsg
Sales is not a boogeyman u can attribute everything to. That's literally what Si Yan was trying to say too u can't just blanket something,btohqsg
But sadly I did too many stuff,btohqsg
and what im saying is..im not blanketing that to a context. im using that as a example that could just be replaced with any other context,btohqsg
when a salesperson approaches you you already have a perception of them and that turns you awaya stranger approaching you in friendly mannerisms wouldnt provide that perception and you'd be far more open,btohqsg
