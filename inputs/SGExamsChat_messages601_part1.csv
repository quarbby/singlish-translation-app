There's  ppl who Ik that took same path as me and went to JC one shot,btohqsg
Honestly I wish I took PSLE more seriously so that I could’ve been able to go to express,btohqsg
During that time I hated studies,btohqsg
Can only work on the future,btohqsg

so lazy that my mom couldn’t beat me enough to do assessment,btohqsg
i was half interested in sci(bio part) and half not,btohqsg
i rmb I had tuition and past year papers and it still didn’t help  proof that if you have the drive/interest you can actually do well,btohqsg
the only studying i did for psle according to my parents was,btohqsg
my mother actl wanted me to go neighbourhood sch causd distance,btohqsg
