I thought no picture books were boring,btohqsg
But once you read its like watching a movie,btohqsg
Na reading is different from watching a movie,btohqsg
Yes it's Carmine which is from bugs..,btohqsg
Well I can watch a movie in 2 hour but I cannot do the same for the book in 2 hour,btohqsg
Books provide more detail but sometimes it's more convenient to watch a movie,btohqsg
I can and do watch 5-6 movies in a day when I am on a binge,btohqsg
Books hurt more when someone dies,btohqsg
You haven't hit the erotic genre of movies yet,btohqsg
