Oh CIMB? Maybe my $ much smaller,btohqsg
<100K  depending on the amount and thus the tiers and the eirFulfillment wise  uob 1 is easier for me.. but the maximization of its benefits is at 4% at 150K,btohqsg
Mmm do u recommend or not.. ?I left some of my coffers there..Am suspish too,btohqsg
u see it is a lose lose situationif you have small amounts.. whether 2.9% or 3.2% not much differenceif you have big amounts  you want to risk itthus  i went with SCB or similarly reputed banks both ways.,btohqsg
Sorry gurus another noob question please. For the HSBC ega account  assuming I have placed 100k inside  is my one month interest supposed to be like in the region of a few hundreds instead of 100plus please?,btohqsg

Now till 31 Jan 25  GXS FlexiCard may be a better card to use overseas if compared to Trust Cashback Card 🤔YMMV.,btohqsg
15% cashback on selected category with min spend + 1% cashback on non-selected category without min spendvs5% cashback on all transactions without min spend and up to $3 cashback on transaction of at least $10,btohqsg
yeah i think it sounds pretty decent.my main reason for using Trust overseas is 15% on Dining with minimum FX charges.,btohqsg
since Trust blended rate is 4.9% overall  it might be agar agar the same as GXS Flexicard (i didn't explore this as I don't have GXS),btohqsg
GXS FlexiCard may have more  not forgetting the lucky draw mechanic. Both stack.,btohqsg
btw  who still overseas? most should be coming back.. next week start school liao..,btohqsg
Another news  Grab introducing partner fee so they can contribute to their drivers/riders CPF and other benefits.,btohqsg
Single ppl who have money and on leave 🤭🤭🤭,btohqsg
Oh my. Esaver marathon dropped rates again (Jan-Mar) compared with Dec-Feb.,btohqsg
at least i have a free option for March 2025 at 2.75% (no requirement for month on month to increase.. it is on entire ADB).,btohqsg
Doesn't bode well for the other savings accounts..i'm watching you HSBC EGA!!! grrrr,btohqsg
That's a huge drop. Hmm. Not sure if to lock in CIMB promo now,btohqsg
if - mainly for Card up i suggest can go for Visa first - most of the Card up offer primary for Visa (like income tax)Visa version - now got luggage for NTB welcome offer until 31 Dec - Tnc applies,btohqsg

hi gurus  im helping my mom book a flight on SIA/Scoot. i have some questions to confirm some things!i bust UOB lady's this statement month and only applicable card left is UOBKF1. am i allowed to use my KrisFlyer account to help her book? in order to get some miles from the bookingif #1 is a yes 2. i should pay with my UOBKF card directly or is there another ideal/suggested way  and i'd get 3mpd from paying directly (it states KF miles earned per $1 spent on SIA  scoot)?3. are the KF miles the same (or credited to the KF account directly)  from paying via Kris+  paying SIA/scoot/SIA related directly with UOBKF card? as the t&c says posted to your card in a calendar monththank you!,btohqsg
1  yes2 directbtw uob lady is by calendar month not statement month,btohqsg
U can use your uob krisflyer to pay for anyone but only if u book yourself u get scoot benefit but i think there is some benefit change,btohqsg
oh gotcha! so just simply book via SIA/scoot website then pay with UOBKF  and i should receive the 3mpd accordingly?thanks guys!!edit: okay nvm i think trazora has answered it already. thank you both!,btohqsg
Checking:Best cashback cc for uobBest cashback cc for ocbcThanks!,btohqsg
