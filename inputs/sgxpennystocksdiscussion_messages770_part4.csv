These used to be the barbarians in Chinese history,btohqsg
Hk drivers can go really close  their precision too pro,btohqsg
Close is not the issue. It's aggression,btohqsg

Up in the north you can expect fist much sooner,btohqsg
Apply the same attitude to their driving,btohqsg
But in the south.. ppl cook soup n make buns😏,btohqsg
Aggressive cutting  queue jumping  road rage etc,btohqsg
I'm already used to it after driving in BJ and surrounding area for years. Very different from south,btohqsg
Northern cuisine is more ahem plain,btohqsg
Heavy flavors. Like barbarian food 😁,btohqsg
