3.3% EGA bonus is based on mar adb for 2 months  1% from everyday rewards program is based on month-on-month.... Very sneaky on hsbc if u r not careful.,btohqsg
For me  3.35% p.a. is still better than 3% p.a. ü§™,btohqsg
HSBC EGA need $2k incremental ADB?,btohqsg
2k deposit* and 5 transactions out,btohqsg
This is the 1% from Everyday+ Cashback rewards. Like I said  my next best alternative is 3% p.a.  which HSBC EGA promo gives more at 3.35% p.a.,btohqsg
Thanks! Time to look into it too ü§£ü§£ previously I was looking at Bonus$aver because the criterias were very easy to hit. But then nerfed üíÄ,btohqsg
As of 30 April the average daily balance increase vs last mth is nil  though I have fufilled the salary requirement right but I am not qualified for the bonus right ?Cos i open ocbc 360 in Mar but I only deposit cash on 1 Apr and my salary is credited in Apr.,btohqsg
If you're asking for Apr's bonus interest  I think you will clock the Save criteria with that.,btohqsg
Would think ur increase will be ur full April average daily balance,btohqsg
$2k must be fresh funds or can withdraw and deposit again?,btohqsg
But is reflected as 0 as of 30 April in website. Which is strange- cos i open the acct in Mar and first deposit money on 2 Apr. meaning mar is 0 and apr is x amount. So yep  shld be the full increment,btohqsg
But is showing 0 via ocbc website,btohqsg
If I registered near end April. Now I transfer 100k from UOB. What is the effective interest rate for HSBC EGA?100k in UOB account meeting all criteria will not meet 4% right.So I assume EGA should be better off. Please kindly advise. Thanks,btohqsg
Maybe can check with CSO. They should be able to provide the data from backend?,btohqsg
So if I register for an account now  I‚Äôm thinking I can only make it for 1 month which is June right? Cos they need to see the increment from prev month?Actually quite confused with how HSBC EGA work üòÖ their calculator not helpful also,btohqsg
Mine also showing 0 as of April 30. Very strange. Yesterday when I checked it was 5xx+,btohqsg
T&c states reference month is Apr. Additional 1% comes from Everyday+ Rewards programme  which effective for 1 month only.The next account you can look at is SC eSaver account.I'm in a similar issue where don't have 75k  a lot of accounts give the basic bonus interest of 3% or less. ü§™,btohqsg
If you registered in April  then you have to look at April's t&c.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  if I currently have earmark with uob. Can I apply another one and qualified for the bonus cash credit?,btohqsg
Yup agree. HSBC EGA is complicated,btohqsg
Hahah HSBC EGA too confusing for me maybe I stick with OCBC 360 for now ü§£,btohqsg
If yes  will the new earmark drag the 1st earmark date further as the 2nd earmark date?,btohqsg
Just to check do I need to keep my funds in UOB One acc till I get the interest or can I withdraw it today to shift it to OCBC 360?,btohqsg
Calculated for future reference  4.15% p.a. if 500k  including Everyday+ Rewards programme.,btohqsg
I saw the T&C  if I registered in April for the promotion. They will compare to the flash funds deposited in May minus off the what was held in April.I had to keep the money inside for May and June. I just want to check as the interest paid in Aug. can I draw out the money in 1st July?Any thanks for any good advise.,btohqsg
You did not read April's t&c. Check out April's t&c first.,btohqsg

Assuming your current earmark was from Jan's promo and the earmark ends mid May.Your earmark registration in May for earmarking in Jun under Apr's promo don't even overlap anymore.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing this! Essentially only the 1st month is 4+%. The 2nd month is only 3+%,btohqsg
April average daily balance mot match lah,btohqsg

I just sent the EGA SMS  I realised that the SMS still reflects Apr EGA and not May EGA.,btohqsg
ü§£ maybe they never work today to change the sms template,btohqsg
Yup same! They didn't update. So lousy,btohqsg
Where did you find this message? The info is all wrong lol. You should refer to the t&c document provided by HSBC - forApril's promo.,btohqsg
Oh. From Google. Haiz  can‚Äôt find the article ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
They don't bother to update the SMS. Really minus points for HSBC,btohqsg
"https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/185057Don't bother opening the pdf link as they lazily replace the document (notice ""lny"" for Lunar New Year). I assume is the same person/team updating the SMSes. Someone should fire this guy at HSBC. ü§°Ref to Mar ADB  promo's bonus interest applies to Apr and May  credits in Jul.The 2nd month don't get the 1% from Everyday+ Rewards fyi.",btohqsg
Must be the same guy who upload the EGA bonus interest promo pdf document.,btohqsg
CardUp provids a very useful calculator on their website. Maybe you should check it out.,btohqsg
Yes  the interest base on April MAB.,btohqsg
I'm sure Chris did indicate which promo is for New  Existing or both customers.,btohqsg
If you don't plan to get May's interest then transfer today.,btohqsg
It should not matter for you anyway since you left Mar empty.,btohqsg
Got this msg when trying to login,btohqsg
I logged in 3 times for the past 5 mins no issues. In fact I'm using it now lol,btohqsg
Hi! Wanted to check if I sign up big savings promo for May  should I input money now (1-May) or 31st May?,btohqsg
Ok so its not just me üò™,btohqsg
Same I tried many times 10 mins ago,btohqsg
