Do note that both insurance and investment is mean for long term. If u have the spare cash after emergency fund have been set aside why not. But the agenda must always be the product suit your need and not because of the bonus interest,btohqsg
There is lock in period for bank product  and penalty for early withdrawal  so dont be penny wise and pound foolish,btohqsg

Sorry regarding the local spend of instarem amaze card with Citi rewards cards. I know online transactions give 4 miles per dollar spend.

Can I know those with the citi rewards and amaze card what do you guys spend. I am getting it as my first Credit card Im not really sure what to spend to reach 500 dollar min spending,btohqsg
Sorry in advance for this noob question. I just wanna get a clear picture about it,btohqsg
Paying bills or topup don't give points,btohqsg
Travel  booking hotels etc also don't give points,btohqsg
Citibank credit card application process is strict. Called to check previous workplace. Up till now not yet approved. Guess not in time.,btohqsg
No noob questions but once you've learnt  you can pay it forward by helping others here on what you have learnt in Future,btohqsg
You mean the bank called your previous workplace to background check you?,btohqsg
May I know those having the card. What are u guys spending on,btohqsg
No need to apologize also  don't sweat about it,btohqsg
If you just want to fulfil spending rewards  watch thishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HRtDzj4_4Q,btohqsg
Is there a reason why most of the time u recommend singsaver promo instead of moneysmart ?@ChrisHMSG,btohqsg
I just wanna fulfil the promotion spending requirements at the start,btohqsg
Ah... for the free gift. You can make online purchase from Lazada or shopee or supermarket purchase to obtain min $500 spending,btohqsg
What are the possible reason of rejecting credit card application other then income low or credit score low,btohqsg
Still in progress. I just started work and my cpf was prorated and I'm kinda of worry,btohqsg
Mine approved within 4 days of application,btohqsg
cos no perks for linking to Amaze for local spend. In fact for those specific merchant listed in TnC eligible for 4mpd  will no longer earn 4mpd if mcc is not eligible cos merchant become Amaze.,btohqsg
Kris+ app payment mode only gpay wallet which is tagged to amaze card. Will the citirewards card earn points?,btohqsg
citi rewards via gpay online (e.g. kris+) excluded from 10x points. Citi rewards+ amaze via gpay online eligible for 10x points so long mcc not excluded.,btohqsg
Wow that‚Äôs good. Mine already past 31st Oct  not eligible for the singsaver gifts anymore.,btohqsg
Just have to be approved before 1 Dec 2022 to qualify,btohqsg
Meaning I should remove citirewards from gpay and replace with amaze correct?,btohqsg
Just a question. I just used the CIMB cc to buy $300 NTUC vouchers via paywave. However i was told to input my signature as the amount is above $200. In my case is the transaction still consider as contactless payment?,btohqsg
not sure anyone ask this before.... any most efficient way to spend cdc vouchors?? can we use it to buy/offset large ticket items purchases like washing machine?,btohqsg
Used it at zi char for a nice family meal üòÑ,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGjust watched ur SRS Strategy with Poems. Amazing video. Didn‚Äôt know I can invest in S&P500 using SRS. I currently use a US-based broker (Schwab) which charges $0 commission/fees etc so never considered it  but looking at the $$$ I can save in tax  I might just consider your strategy instead. A few questions :1. Is Poems trustworthy? Sorry to say this but their website looks like those scam websites üòÇ2. Do you (or anyone here) know how long it takes to open an SRS account? And is DBS the most recommended one?3. Do you (or anyone here) know how long it takes to open a Poems account?4. Apart from Poems fee/commission  do banks charge a fee as well when u transact/buy S27 on Poems?5. Can you load USD (using Transferwise or others) directly to Poems? Or must top up SGD only and use their forex?,btohqsg
yeahh but expiring dec and juz nice need purchase washing machine... see where can use the vouchors to partially offset the purchase,btohqsg
Actually tbh  SRS feels like a lite version of CPF üòÇ,btohqsg
only diff is that it's not mandatory and you can only withdraw after a certain age,btohqsg
Sometime neighbourhood pricing not as competitive to big retailer,btohqsg
OIC thanks. Will remove ocbc titan from amaze unless overseas use,btohqsg
