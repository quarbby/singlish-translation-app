wa this is cuz of the camber..?,btohqsg
i wld say depends on ur driving but rough gauge 15k,btohqsg
car ride high wan go how fast bro haha. must be safe,btohqsg
if you want to be safe 10-12 can rotate le,btohqsg
cant be helped 99 bends is just next door,btohqsg
oki but rotate is front to back only right,btohqsg
so the inner side will still wear more,btohqsg
That's why i getting coilover after my spoilers,btohqsg
u on square set up hor,btohqsg
both front and rear tyre size the same,btohqsg
yep no need worry 12k lor,btohqsg
No bloody way u peak at 160,btohqsg
i dont think you have fierce front camber hor,btohqsg
My 1.6 mz3 also can 180,btohqsg
but i tink 1.8 hybrid accelerate like slow ah,btohqsg
okay lor then no need worry,btohqsg
rear is the one thats visibly obvious,btohqsg
haha i know somebody running 3°,btohqsg
Time to go do some tuning,btohqsg
Really 160 step full go down the highway slope at cte sle also same,btohqsg
also worn but aint that bad,btohqsg
My RPM capped at 5RPM only,btohqsg
Ur right foot is eco mode la,btohqsg
annoying is thats the inner side so its not easy to see and check regularly,btohqsg
last time i tot 1.8 + a hybrid shd be power,btohqsg
bend down cannot see ah haha,btohqsg
U have a sport mode or manual mode that u can engage?,btohqsg
no eh  need jack up then can see,btohqsg
Sometimes the auto will shift at the rev limit,btohqsg
ps4 not a durable tyre sia,btohqsg
Ouh yarForget about that mode HAHAHA,btohqsg
A lot of rental car got power cut,btohqsg
I ECO mode step full deh,btohqsg
u think PS4 is bad  bridgestone is even worse,btohqsg
Eco mode the ecu is very conservative,btohqsg
potenza ah? I only heard PZero no durability,btohqsg
My friend 1.6 hybrid shuttle sports mode capped 180 also,btohqsg
Yeah all the potenza wear very fast,btohqsg
but its better than PS4S imo,btohqsg
I was actl thinking get GY F1A6,btohqsg
and I like the sidewall a bit more,btohqsg
How about u try off eco mode first,btohqsg
Lol sometimes its better not to touch shit regarding ecu,btohqsg
Can but improvement abt 10 to 15hp only cause no turbo,btohqsg
Playing with the ecu of a hybrid car  unless existing tested and proven maps  quite risky,btohqsg
Have yet to try because been busyAt night no go out whack also nowadays,btohqsg
Need find renowned tuners to be safe haha,btohqsg
We call it “rushing to work”,btohqsg
And see me mount kerb like the JB civic,btohqsg
The point of a SUV is u can mount and carry on,btohqsg
