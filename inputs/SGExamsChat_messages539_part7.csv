as in using a students FYP work in their research isnâ€™t a big deal but the prof usually contacts the student asking for perm or crediting them as a co author,btohqsg

karen ard the world gonna rage at sg for 'women's rights' and wtv bs,btohqsg
i just learnt that for the cops to catch you on drug trafficking charge  you dont need to be seen at the airport with it,btohqsg
as long as there is a reasonable suspicion you are transporting drugs from one part of sg to another  that could also be a drug trafficking charge,btohqsg
or is that not the case?,btohqsg
never been caught by police for drug trafficking before,btohqsg
nah..cause i imagine  if that is the case...alot of ppl bout be surprised with the death penalty passing narcotics from one person to another,btohqsg
itâ€™s clearly described in the actual law,btohqsg
As surprised as people realizing that the law is written there clearly since god knows when  and that plenty of such cases have been reported in the news.,btohqsg
cause all along i thought you were caught if you were travelling through the airport  not on the city streets,btohqsg
if youâ€™re in possession of more than a certain amount youâ€™re presumed to be trafficking,btohqsg
if youâ€™re trafficking more than 25g itâ€™s the death penalty,btohqsg
You thoughtâ€¦ You can also think unicorns exist. But no mate. Far from it.You can try to cherry pick the laws. I wouldnâ€™t advise it.,btohqsg
just something i realised recently  thats all,btohqsg
Clearly you mean more than this  what with the previous posting about the executions.The majority supports the tough stance on drugs and capital punishment.,btohqsg
Youâ€™re free to try to sway peopleâ€™s opinion. As are people to resist them here.Peddling weak ass justifications like the laws arenâ€™t clear enough is just pffft. Try harder.,btohqsg
the law was amended in 2013  certain cases was shifted to life imprisonment. So after 2013  if someone was still hanged..they were definitely more than a peddler/trafficker,btohqsg
im not swaying public opinion..never said anything bout not supporting or supporting the death penalty. Was just intrigued by the cases,btohqsg
