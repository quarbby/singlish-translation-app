the graphic design ppl i've interviewed all just put on google drive,btohqsg
but if u want to stand out i guess u can make your own site,btohqsg
if u feel like the URL ugly u can buy a domain name and make it look nice,btohqsg
i tried doing that but people decided to use their phones instead,btohqsg
i see the museum picture of mrt last time,btohqsg
"i try to ask something that relates to them  eg ""have you watched the lecture XXX""",btohqsg
github sites is good too if u know how to code your own site,btohqsg
then they either give one word answer or completely ignore and talk to their other friends,btohqsg
but honestly if it's just a basic HTML/CSS site  you're better off using google sites imho,btohqsg
Yea just freeloaded a bunch of diff technique from a bunch of users to use on my site+ chatgpt..ended up giving me a B+,btohqsg
same except i dont even get to the talking irl portion,btohqsg
That's how introvert like us talk if you just ask us for the first time,btohqsg
i thought touching grass doesn't just mean socialising,btohqsg
ngl using chatgpt to fake coding skills is becoming more and more of a pet peeve to me,btohqsg
Majorly I did use github to source for other codes to fit it to my specifications,btohqsg
imagine yall are classmates or friends already but they just.. can't be bothered,btohqsg
I mean ultimately at the end of the day if ur just tryna code smth to make ur life easier,btohqsg
Introverts will slowly lengthen their replies or be more involved the longer you talk to them,btohqsg
I used chatGPT + some understanding of Python and Java to do a macro using VBA last night LOL,btohqsg
i feel like you should at least know the basics n principles of programming  and stuff like chatgpt shld just be to help find information to supplement the info you have.if code is just cobbled tgt using chatgpt and copy pasted from stack overflow then any best practices just get thrown out the window,btohqsg
okay... but theres nth objectively wrong with copy pasting code what,btohqsg
"its just a ""lazier"" but still functional way of doing smth",btohqsg
only issue is if anything fks up u cant debug it,btohqsg
nth objectively wrong  and as long as you understand and can rewrite the code again without gpt again  then im all for it,btohqsg
cuz udek what ur code is doing,btohqsg
u need to understand the code you're writing,btohqsg
if you don't  then you're not coding,btohqsg
But whats wrong with just using chatGPT,btohqsg
i mean but if ur intention is just to create a piece of work,btohqsg
nth wrong but just that if u don't understand what it outputs and just use it blindly  then imo it's quite pointless,btohqsg
i would but then idt im introverted im just socially awkward,btohqsg
I mean idk I was thinking abt this last night also considering how easy it is to code now cause of ChatGPT,btohqsg
it's like u cobble tgt smth but you don't understand what you've cobbled tgt,btohqsg
it just devalues the role of most programmers,btohqsg
cuz most CS grads I see they dont even know wtf theyre doing,btohqsg
being introvert doesn't mean ur socially awkward or vice versa  yes,btohqsg
to me it's impt to understand what you're doing ah  and stuff like chatgpt shld only serve as a tool to help you get information and understand things faster,btohqsg
most CS grads i talk to aso don't know what they're doing,btohqsg
in a learning environment that makes sense,btohqsg
my friend who during our course was clueless during undergrad code stuff is now working on software for work,btohqsg
but in a job-environment im all for if ChatGPT can get it done,btohqsg
"Talking bout this  one of my intern colleagues went to a meeting to showcase his ""major accomplishment"" he spent the last 3 weeks on  guess what it was.Him copying a pdf into chatgpt then asking it to turn it into a excel file then be able to copy it into another excel sheet and is replicated the same as what is shown or specified in the pdf",btohqsg
but how useful knowing actual coding is really depends on the work itself,btohqsg
CS doesn't teach much useful real world stuff from what my friends tell me,btohqsg
i mean coding is a language,btohqsg
is chatgpt manually converting the file for him,btohqsg
"Then the first thing one of the supervisors told him was ""Oh so you are putting our info into chatgpt? hmn""",btohqsg
Theres so many prospective CS students in my camp last time,btohqsg
well you should always be learning useful skills  regardless of coding or wtv else,btohqsg
and coding is an especially useful skill to have,btohqsg
Like you copy and paste text from a pdf into chatgpt  so he said his 3 weeks was spent on finding the correct prompt to ask chat gpt in such a way it would return results that could be copied into a excel file and that excel file show the specified result needed,btohqsg
lol yk u can just open a pdf in word document and it'll automatically be converted,btohqsg
spending 3 weeks to do that,btohqsg
or spending 2 weeks trying to piss off telegram moderators for $100,btohqsg
The info in the pdf was in a paragraph/pointform format,btohqsg
i had to convert non standardised pdf formats into an excel database,btohqsg
okay ik which one is sadder now,btohqsg
pdf -> word automatic conversion  then VBA to extract and standardise data formats into excel,btohqsg
U can always use VBA to do it,btohqsg
my friend did a macro that converts pdf files to word documents so we can extract data into excel,btohqsg
"and the supposed""big data graduate"" from TP(my understudy)",btohqsg
so the low-life person who couldnt programme (me) had to go fix it :/,btohqsg
"Idk he did it manually and my other intern friend was like ""so he spent 3 weeks copying info into chat gpt""",btohqsg
all the coding courses ppl need to ownself do portfolio to prove themselves lor imo,btohqsg
the course teach u fundamentals n theory,btohqsg
and this is why i will never go CS,btohqsg
2 weeks? Nah it was longer ü§£,btohqsg
but doesn't mean shit if u can't prove it,btohqsg
i give all my admiration to coders,btohqsg
Yea so best is code out your portfolio to show what you can do,btohqsg
it says a lot when i'm talking about stuff that i fully expect CS ppl to know but they don't,btohqsg
Ppl in my course using wix,btohqsg
Getting told their grade is capped at B,btohqsg
My friend is going NUS CS this year,btohqsg
Wants to use it and never understood the mechanics of me  ppl said it was easier but never could understand it,btohqsg
google sites + a custom domain will always be the easiest  value for time solution,btohqsg
After the interview with my first supervisor for that module  the supervisor told me to use wixüíÄ,btohqsg
After I showed him my html/css/js portfolio,btohqsg
(for some reason a custom domain makes your site looks more impressive),btohqsg
must know how to do both of those,btohqsg
Wah  it's ok thanks for the offer but I'm fine right now,btohqsg
maybe u should be a twin towers,btohqsg
so the planes will fly over ur head,btohqsg
u can be my test subject,btohqsg
just like the sarcasm flies over ur head,btohqsg
and proof for my SFBT level 2 certification,btohqsg
mfs live in bali and be ‚Äúlife coaches‚Äù,btohqsg
i can talk but i run out of ideas easily,btohqsg
unless if im talking with close friends  then we just talk shit and random stuff,btohqsg
yeah you need to eat the grass too,btohqsg
you need to smell  see  touch  hear  taste,btohqsg
And omg what is with that flair,btohqsg
jiejie im going to go eat at 1340,btohqsg
Same here  I spent the whole morning yawning,btohqsg
Though drank a cup of coffee liao,btohqsg
jiejie what subj should i study now,btohqsg
i havent eaten anything since 7am,btohqsg
I think I can continue to pray to not rely on coffee  coz that is for sure not going to happen,btohqsg
such a nice place to study,btohqsg
actually come to think of it my entire life felt surreal,btohqsg
its like my last memory was birth  then where i am now,btohqsg
pri sch and being borderline homeschooled in sec sch and then jc,btohqsg
if u think of the baked cheese rice as baked cheese rice,btohqsg
but if u think of it as baked rice with cheese on top,btohqsg
cuz u have an image in ur head of what a cheese baked rice is supposed to taste like,btohqsg
thats how u bench 100 i see,btohqsg
but then again after i got out of ns,btohqsg
should i buy a drink or nah,btohqsg
Bud ain't even sure of the success rate,btohqsg
Why tf am I hired for a intern where I do nothing...literally spent the last 3-4 hrs on telegram,btohqsg
intern working to kill time at work?,btohqsg
Excel but nothing is coming through cause the people that are suppose to send shit are slacking..so now I'm slacking,btohqsg
Am I tripping or that cup looks smaller than normal,btohqsg
Got a lot for very cheap prices,btohqsg
i js wanna know cuz i tryna resell to poeple,btohqsg
Oh the market in the store and resell is very diff,btohqsg
Brand new? 2-5 yea if it's used better to donate,btohqsg
Guys what is a untrained school counsellor,btohqsg
lmao $5 was my tys price,btohqsg
aite now imma do bio i dont feel like doing chem ://,btohqsg
i‚Äôm reselling to people at my class at $5 cuz they all priv canidate üòÖ,btohqsg
tf I paid $12 for my topical tys,btohqsg
i bought from my school cos compulsory,btohqsg
my math one bought thru cher  sci was sch bookshop,btohqsg
the rest of my subj didn't have tys  eng my cher say dunnid buy  cpa mt ebs not availble thru commercial way cher need print out for us,btohqsg
i saw on carou  cheapest i saw was $2 mos ex i saw was 14,btohqsg
Here comes the security checks folks...gotta dress up grandma,btohqsg
I love it I wrote my sisters timed trial for her for her RI GP paper then she got almost 10 marks higher than the next highest,btohqsg
mfing RGS students saying my method doesnt work in RI,btohqsg
bruh this talk is damn boring,btohqsg
apparantly her cher was shocked cuz she didnt expect this standard from a J1 for thier first esassy,btohqsg
I WAS SUPPOSED TO LEAVE SCH AT 1,btohqsg
bro the teacher is bombastic side eyeing me,btohqsg
My father told me yesterday that ai drivers going to replace our cars in 10 years,btohqsg
is ur father one of those people who dont take opportunities,btohqsg
I can't help but have to remind him  in 10 years we will still have petrol cars,btohqsg
AI drivers doesnt mean no petrol cars...,btohqsg
cuz i was going home from a club,btohqsg
And petrol is not a infinite recource,btohqsg
then my sister was rushing me for my essay plan,btohqsg
cuz she can bring in a cheatsheet,btohqsg
then i just randomly squirmed smth out,btohqsg
I told him  then who is going to refill the ai cars when they run out of battery,btohqsg
ya RI allows them to bring a cheatsheet,btohqsg
RVHS selects the quotes for their students to analyse for AQ,btohqsg
TMJC doesnt test the full paper 2 format for GP,btohqsg
RI allows students to bring in a 2 sided cheatsheet for an essay,btohqsg
Hearing my uncle's sounds like it but he has his reasons I guess,btohqsg
DHS does a timed trial for purely one introduction + one body paragraph,btohqsg
whats the pt of giving ur students a timed trial if this is the case LOL,btohqsg
Yea I literally told him  there's a reason why Tesla's self driving feature is not allowed in sg..laws in itself takes decades to draw up,btohqsg
im not even allowed to read notes during lecture,btohqsg
at least let me study la,btohqsg
maybe that 12 year old girl wouldnt have gotten hospitalised,btohqsg
reasons why singapore doesnt have a decent gp distinction rate,btohqsg
We ain't going to have laws made that will be passed past quick enough to see ai cars on the streets in a decade,btohqsg
YIJC does a proper timed trial,btohqsg
one of my YI students has a paper 1 timed trial this week,btohqsg
3 P1 Timed trials and 3 P2 Timed trials (mandatory),btohqsg
then beyond that every HBL day he did a full P1 + P2 timed trial (8 to 9.30am P1  9.30 to 10.30 break  10.30 to 12 P2),btohqsg
maybe she came ej and thats why ej is a shitshow now,btohqsg
Popular got extra 10% discount tho for members + i realised the h1 chinese one popular more ex,btohqsg
If ur sch is also not operated by popular,btohqsg
i bought all my sch books frm popular tho,btohqsg
this is why you do NOT let students have a platform to ask anonymous qns,btohqsg
ESHAN MENTIONED WHO TF IS SHE,btohqsg
i slept through half of it,btohqsg
actl no i was doodling some stuff,btohqsg
I drew a whole seaside town for my o levels humanities,btohqsg
Yes until I realise the paper I crushed was my answer,btohqsg
And the paper I handed up was that art work,btohqsg
anyway now im legit damn snaps,btohqsg
isok u post in the correct chat i will try to help,btohqsg
my cher say im like disrespecting his time cus i want to take the slot of some1 else who alrdy didnt show up,btohqsg
Bruh I just got my ns grading,btohqsg
I can't believe what I got,btohqsg
D bruh I got pending medical review,btohqsg
PES D for like almost 1 year,btohqsg
Oh they alr sent me to go two more medical checks at heart center this month,btohqsg
Idk  I myself don't know ü§î,btohqsg
Siyan ps2 is a nogo man :(,btohqsg
Let's see after checkups if it's pesB  C or E üíÄ,btohqsg
Meanwhile my intern friend national day intake,btohqsg
Meanwhile i heard of someone pes A (or B) idk when he has high cholesterol,btohqsg
The dr didnt say anything other than red marking the reportüëÄ,btohqsg
I cant remember exact figures but legit super high,btohqsg
Tbh if im a guy maybe i will be pes e,btohqsg
But the person alrd didnt show up...,btohqsg
I dun get how is it disrespecting his time  it is respecting his time coz instead of doing nth  he has u,btohqsg
Wait wait how does a cheat sheet help for gp,btohqsg
They know the qns in advance,btohqsg
Maybe I shud have clarified that,btohqsg
Like so basically they're given the QP and allowed to bring in a 2 sided cheatseet,btohqsg
Oh wah the sch provided the qns in adv??,btohqsg
more like for oral practice  cus he let asigned everyone a timing left to us to swap if necessary  the 2 ppl supposed to be there always not paying attention in class kind so cfm not gonna come for this,btohqsg
i asked the chet before can i just come also and if they dont show up just test me instead,btohqsg
then he said i cant force me him to test me because he alrdy assigned the time,btohqsg
Assigned the time to lepak ah,btohqsg
Wait paper 2 they give the qns in adv??,btohqsg
The whole compre and summary and all that?,btohqsg
assigned the time for which student to come at which time,btohqsg
If like that i would just do the whole thing and write the whole paper at home on the 2 sided cheatsheet n just bring in lmao (i dun think it will even take 2 full pages),btohqsg
So he just deciding he wants to go by the book,btohqsg
is just a name in a google docs that he is so adamant he wont test others if their name not at that specific timeslot,btohqsg
And is lazy enough to not change a schedule that could or may have already been planned,btohqsg
i understand want to give every1 an opportunity,btohqsg
but like tell me off like i did smth egregious,btohqsg
the schedule is he let us plan ourselves if need to swap liddat,btohqsg
My father told me during his time  people could downpes for fear of grass,btohqsg
I still can't believe weng is armor,btohqsg
i hope they become best friends,btohqsg
how come cant find this book in popular?,btohqsg
I got like a bunch of unused o levels books,btohqsg
Two NTU freshmen who were selected after having gone through aptitude-based admissions said they were grateful that Singapore‚Äôs two biggest universities are increasingly applying broader criteria in selecting students.NTU undergraduate Edwin Chew  24  who is in the Singapore men‚Äôs national handball team  was glad that his university took into account his sporting achievements when considering him for a place in the maritime studies degree course.‚ÄúI started playing handball in Secondary 1 and have grown to love the sport. And I am proud to be part of the Singapore team that won medals at some significant competitions  including the SEA Games. I never thought that one day my sporting achievements would land me a place in a university when my results fell slightly short of the entry requirement.‚ÄùMs Nishaa C.  24  who did poorly in JC but excelled in her polytechnic studies after her A levels  said NTU took into account how she overcame the challenging circumstances she faced to go on to do well at Republic Polytechnic. She also stood out for her contributions to community involvement projects at the polytechnic.‚ÄúI did poorly in JC because I had to work to help support my family  which meant that I had little time for my studies. But I did much better at Republic Polytechnic  although I had to work daily at my father‚Äôs hawker stall to help him. So  although my grade point average was a little below the entry score for the Bachelor of Science degree  they took into account my family challenges  as well as the community involvement projects that I was involved in ‚Äù she said.‚ÄúIf not for aptitude-based admissions  I would not have had the opportunity to show that I am deserving of a place¬†in NTU.‚Äù,btohqsg
wym smu is so much portfolio also,btohqsg
Fast so I can look smart in class,btohqsg
Gonna pop at the new ns square,btohqsg
Wah today legit at work nothing üò≠,btohqsg
I tot over here it says u now need to meet the igp too,btohqsg
wow it says only for boys,btohqsg
someone pissed off because ntu accidentally sent them the wrong message,btohqsg
but the message is a scholarship,btohqsg
so they werent supposed to receive it but ntu fucked up,btohqsg
then like want to rant abit,btohqsg
Speeding and most likely mount kerb and flip,btohqsg
tdy alot of car turtle it seems,btohqsg
also i saw an ambulance like an hr ago,btohqsg
wah this one like movie star,btohqsg
no cause someone mentioned it in another tele grp,btohqsg
if i save at least 4 leaves,btohqsg
then u see me in tekong/hendon camp -1 day,btohqsg
but u havent owadio yet righttt,btohqsg
my daddy might bring me cuz quite near his workplace,btohqsg
then u go some paya lebar camp,btohqsg
when will u get your sarssen,btohqsg
wah then will you fix sia planes,btohqsg
will i get a chance to see fikri,btohqsg
if u can afford by all means,btohqsg
do u listen to music often,btohqsg
aiya just bring your guzheng and play during working hours,btohqsg
yoy dh to do what ur friends do what,btohqsg
oh ive thought of doing alot except my boss is like the table behind me,btohqsg
Internship is the art of making a 2 hours activity into a 2 day one,btohqsg
i mean what kind of courses cause all i know is linkedin courses,btohqsg
easier to hide a phone on the table than a whole pc screen facing everybody,btohqsg
nope but ill check it out,btohqsg
Just go to MITs course ware lmao,btohqsg
U spam certs for MOOCs only if u in Uni and wanna transfer it,btohqsg
ok lah technically not my boss..just supervisor..but my own supervisor using his phone on games constantly...nobody in my office watches anything on their pc..just follow culture lorh,btohqsg
Other than that just knock yourself out with Courseware,btohqsg
He should hv accepted it and then i dun think ntu can turn back lol,btohqsg
But i would not expect such an established university to make a big mistake,btohqsg
funny thing is literally overheard our higherups talk about how they did not need extra people and have no idea who gave the greenlight to hire us interns..so end up we get hired literally become sitting ducks ü§°To the point my colleague who is also a intern was given the task to remove squares on a map...ctrl+delete for 4 hrs straight,btohqsg
Wonder how u managed to hear itüòÇ,btohqsg
"not only  me all the interns+supervisors...then end up 1 month in  tell us can't do wfh cause ""they think interns got nothing to work from home for""",btohqsg
no shit..you dont give us anything..thats like pretty obvious lol,btohqsg
ok lah credit wheres credit due..its great for me mentally but def not in terms of experience,btohqsg
How is that a credit tho,btohqsg
its still a working experience in some sense,btohqsg
Im actually envious of most courses ending w no exams / fyp year  me here hving 4 finalsüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
If u wanna go wisdom tooth extraction  do during ns too  free mc too,btohqsg
i got intern friends that kenna worse than me lol..hearing their stories i cant believe rp even allow such internships,btohqsg
damn that must be the most used foward in this chat,btohqsg
i have a double degree and a phd in spreading misinformation,btohqsg
Doxycycline is same class as tetracycline lmao,btohqsg
My fingers are all white  are yours?,btohqsg
U dun if u put at night,btohqsg
should I join more than 2 CCAs as a Year 1 poly student? I joined 2 event based CCAs  one of which I'm having second thoughts about nowbut mainly I want to enjoy my youth while I still can  but I'm worried about overwhelming myself because I'm an introvert with social anxiety and need time alone to recharge,btohqsg
and don't join for the sake of portfolio if you're not going to enjoy yourself,btohqsg
(unless u know and you're ok w grinding),btohqsg
dont tell me either one of those cca are clubs,btohqsg
(because honestly if u can work through the grind of creating a good portfolio  it'll be worth it),btohqsg
depends on what you want la in the end,btohqsg
I was thinking about joining a sports CCA but in TP most of them need tryouts,btohqsg
story of how im not in any sports in uni,btohqsg
im in my school's club for 2 years now  never attended a single event but still have the badge to say im part of the club,btohqsg
might as well 2 maincomm 2 subcomm,btohqsg
damn man TP cca fair ended today idk how to join,btohqsg
u get points doesn't necessarily mean u do anything,btohqsg
i wld much rather give a spot to someone w a 5 point subcomm rather than 2 3 point subcomm,btohqsg
well there's only so much you can look at with how oversubscribed reclists always are,btohqsg
u were given 3 instead of 5 for wtv reason lor,btohqsg
it's quite literally school policy to give council subcomm up to 5,btohqsg
but jcrc has liberty to give 3  1  or even 0,btohqsg
every hall reclist is oversubbed no..?,btohqsg
i wld imagine 8 wld be more oversubbed than my hall,btohqsg
some nh halls reclist not even open yet,btohqsg
you're looking at the person who scored the lowest in qm mid terms,btohqsg
im just that good at qm,btohqsg
I mean if u just want a room  NH demand rly q low,btohqsg
i think that'll be a consideration for y4 bah,btohqsg
NH good tho i can just HHO anytime i want,btohqsg
can get back hall meh for y3,btohqsg
if not i just sleep at spms only,btohqsg
oh fek my friend and i wanna room tgt at hall 7 tho,btohqsg
he 9 point so idk manz,btohqsg
when to hho before u grad,btohqsg
you come first then we talk,btohqsg
i cld come after my finals,btohqsg
17 may my last day but I need 16th to pack aso,btohqsg
I leave immediately after my last paper sia,btohqsg
8th may i vroom vroom gtfo,btohqsg
udw stay ur full stay meh,btohqsg
why uw me come over sm,btohqsg
I wna know when u come over so I can siam NTU,btohqsg
ya u can come eat hho alone,btohqsg
quite pops. h7 and saraca both,btohqsg
I ask you when u come then udw say,btohqsg
iestin wants to eat hho with me,btohqsg
i stayed h7 my entire undergrad so that‚Äôs my experience anyway,btohqsg
your h7 is old h7 or new h7,btohqsg
then first year of phd i crashed my exs room thats also h7,btohqsg
im getting ptsd just thinking abt that,btohqsg
single room with attached toilet so,btohqsg
wait is si yan man or woman,btohqsg
Guys I have math hist and chem wa next week undone chem hw undone gp hw and guess which subj I am studying now,btohqsg
it was her last year staying hall so splurge a bit,btohqsg
but i paid for the AC,btohqsg
duh I aso want an attached toilet,btohqsg
Next time I see you on cna as a biologist,btohqsg
tbh attached toilet not that useful imo unless you got someone else staying with you lol,btohqsg
Guys stock ur toilet paper NOW,btohqsg
Tbf wouldn't know who you are,btohqsg
Guys faster go and buy the masks and hand sanitizer,btohqsg
I will make the covid 25 when you owadio,btohqsg
Might as well say go Indonesia start forest fire,btohqsg
Ngl I wanna study zoology but sg doesn't offer zoology undergrad,btohqsg
‚Ä¶just so i can shower without having to borrow some guys fob,btohqsg
brother h7 and saraca are all in that area too,btohqsg
but tama is the unpopular one among the 3,btohqsg
I mean I think certain NSAID gels also excuse sun. I believe Fastum excuse too,btohqsg
Ketoprofen gel... photodermatitis if u do so,btohqsg
The mechanism of action just means so lmao,btohqsg
I did a pharmacology study briefly on it before,btohqsg
Some is due to it inhibiting the synthesis of Vitamin D but whereas some it is a catalyst,btohqsg
Then u get a specialist lor,btohqsg
main pt is mo won't shut up,btohqsg
Forwarded messageFrom YTI do not wish to engage in this conversation,btohqsg
u lance coporal only u not CO,btohqsg
then u sol withh me lor,btohqsg
It does and its actually damn fucking cool from a bio perspective,btohqsg
lengthen your wadio like how u lengthen ur promotion,btohqsg
ya gd for bedok so he can punish me morr,btohqsg
I go home club bro and got gold with honours for my cca,btohqsg
I don't go to a regular cca but I help out with my school's events,btohqsg
RP be like: you guys have a system?,btohqsg
Those vocations where they really need manpower  can STC. It's really not bad for a short term job since the salary really fucking competitive,btohqsg
STC though depending on your position the pay is really quite good,btohqsg
but you must go back 10x,btohqsg
Anyways even with the system.. does it matter? Like does it result in a GPA bonus?,btohqsg
No idea what in the fuck any of that means RP is called nothing,btohqsg
Like legit nothing u get it on your CCA records,btohqsg
Wah really ah i tot everyone gets reservist every year,btohqsg
NTU PEARLS provides no GPA advantages also... just for accommodation and the leadership box in your Resume,btohqsg
In Uni.. is either I can get points in pearls or overload by 1-2 more mods in that time allocated,btohqsg
Fast so I can look smart in class,btohqsg
U want look smart sorry u need the skills urself,btohqsg
‚ÄòNext time please be more responsive‚Äô do we owe him anything,btohqsg
Everyone else dh their own work to do ah,btohqsg
His pfp is our reaction. Fucking disappointed,btohqsg
Also why aim to look smart,btohqsg
How come it feels like it is his in-class assignment then he lazy and ask sge for help,btohqsg
But what happens if he's regarded,btohqsg
Real there is always a path to glory  depends on whether u want to put in the effort,btohqsg
Impossible is not a word in the vocabulary,btohqsg
If my grandmother had wheels she would have been a bike,btohqsg
fucking hell some bodoh had the audacity to doxx me on reddit,btohqsg
But later i gym my wrist pain need rso how,btohqsg
Eh lights out time to sleep ah,btohqsg
should i join sge discord ppl,btohqsg
should i join with my catfish alt or my main acc,btohqsg
