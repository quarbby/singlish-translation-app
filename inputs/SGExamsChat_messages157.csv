NUS/NTU still accepted me with the exemption letter as I had to submit or else they would force me to defer,btohqsg
We dk how true it is la,btohqsg
i mean all medical records are medical in confidence anyways,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just the stigma that surrounds it,btohqsg
What's not in confidence is that you keng,btohqsg
Ultimate grand prize that MINDEF can give you,btohqsg
Hmm I enlisted in Jan too,btohqsg
My friend who got his eae into engineering sci in np firstly accpt but rn he consider to withdraw cuz he wanna go jc,btohqsg
Capital letter means H2 small letter means H1,btohqsg
He was inspired by my history teacher so he decided to become like him too?,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt regret withdrawing or staying in the eae  regardless of the choice and outcome,btohqsg
hi guys how‚Äôs the physics paper haha,btohqsg
How do u describe the centre of gravity  setup?,btohqsg
They are the common last topic,btohqsg
BRUH LOL MY INVIGILATOR TOLD US ITS TESTED THEN ENDED UP TELLING US US NO TESTED ü§°,btohqsg
i didnt even do that qns LMAO,btohqsg
"It's true! There was not a time where I can safely say  ""paper ez clap"". :(",btohqsg
Omg  it's the man  the man who can overthrow bedok's regime in o levels study group! üòÆ,btohqsg
Eh for those on o level study break,btohqsg
How hard are y‚Äôall grinding for o levels,btohqsg
Like how many hours a day,btohqsg
He not asking how many ppl yall r grinding btw,btohqsg
What is there to be sarcastic about when a paper is easy? ü§î,btohqsg
@ physics people what did yall write for fig 1.4,btohqsg
the one where u place the wooden rod below the shaft of the motor,btohqsg
That one I tikam so not confident,btohqsg
I knew I'd fail anyway so I just didnt bother doing,btohqsg
Sciences are one of the easiest to score,btohqsg
Have confidence use right techniques and voila,btohqsg
For arts  languages and humanities depends,btohqsg
I personally love Chemistry more than Physics,btohqsg
Yea if u suck like me  everything is hard,btohqsg
So that leads me to be able to understand Chemistry better,btohqsg
Today is O levels Pure Physics Practical,btohqsg
yes. i love combined science chem,btohqsg
Oh   mine is N lvl written paper,btohqsg
But Physics I can take it because majority is math,btohqsg
Bruh I didnt know u needed to substitute in planning bruh,btohqsg
the setter dont have any creative ways to set questions,btohqsg
And some of them are relatable from Chemistry,btohqsg
if i set  i will set it creatively,btohqsg
Except you get to boom something,btohqsg
At least theres a motor that's fun,btohqsg
I spent 10 mins just playing with jt,btohqsg
wait are there teachers in here,btohqsg
At home one time I pour alcohol onto the pan,btohqsg
isnt bio also relatable to chemistry,btohqsg
And got smoke at the same time üò¶,btohqsg
i think bio is kinda linked with chem,btohqsg
In Poly there is a course for that,btohqsg
its more related to be exact lol,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt pour alcohol into open fire,btohqsg
real life context: how to create a chemical warfare,btohqsg
did yall use mm or cm for x,btohqsg
There‚Äôs also a way how to wash clothes,btohqsg
use micrometer screw gauge la yes,btohqsg
Enzymes are those substance to break into parts,btohqsg
i rmb there was like a qn i saw in sec 1,btohqsg
It‚Äôs something has to do with the breaking down of nutrients,btohqsg
then like they say got enzymes to remove the stain,btohqsg
dont yall learn enzymes in s1,btohqsg
I only know how to eat,btohqsg
How the hell did you remember this...,btohqsg
Does anyone know whether it's a curve or a straight line for physics practical planning,btohqsg
anyone here taking n lvls elect hist tmr? any idea what is gna come out,btohqsg
My cher say Stalin   Hitler and Korean War,btohqsg
But I know It‚Äôs not Cold War,btohqsg
This year don‚Äôt have Asia Pacific,btohqsg
Surely one of the essay is about the source case study,btohqsg
you think ww1 will come out? it has been long since it did and only came out once,btohqsg
My essay is all about ah ma story,btohqsg
My dreams for distinction died with the practical,btohqsg
Apparently it's a curve for the sketch,btohqsg
I'm not sure I got a straight line too,btohqsg
What do you expect? Its 2020,btohqsg
Combined science physics practical was ok,btohqsg
chinese got water in the sea,btohqsg
physics now there‚Äôs stupid variations in gradient,btohqsg
I'm that person who wrote R2. üòî,btohqsg
some of my friends got 1000+ for gradient,btohqsg
But I usually dont include physics in L1R5 so I think it shd be fine?,btohqsg
I feel like chemistry will be worse,btohqsg
My gradient is like 12.4 or something,btohqsg
Bruh some people forgot to use the 10 ohm resistor,btohqsg
idk i just used everything they gave,btohqsg
if there isnt the 10 ohm resistor wont it exceed the range?,btohqsg
Pretty sure that if you don't put the resistor then most readings will be out of range,btohqsg
I think m and cm is accepted  mm idk a bit weird for the later questions,btohqsg
I just heard it was a curve,btohqsg
This is for the planning right?,btohqsg
Cuz you sub W=0 into the equation then you get P=0 I thought,btohqsg
Yeah mine started from 0 but cos they say based on my results from the earlier part  then when I draw out my results it couldn‚Äôt fit into a straight line,btohqsg
But I thought by the equation they give in an earlier part  it must be a straight line?,btohqsg
This year is like harder compared to past years,btohqsg
Isnt that true for all tests so far like mother tongue,btohqsg
Idk about the other mother tongues but Chinese written was harder but oral was ok (except I messed up),btohqsg
whats with the setter‚Äôs obsession with wAter,btohqsg
I got the extreme sports oral qn,btohqsg
i had the water pollution qn,btohqsg
Bruh am I suppose to know what rock climbing and zip lining is in chinese?,btohqsg
google translate is my best friend for chinese,btohqsg
I guess now need to focus on O levels,btohqsg
This year actually easier because they don't give ridiculous setups. But it's tougher because of the s.f conversions / SI units. Mess up once and ur graph will not cooperate,btohqsg
Idk it's really hard to focus,btohqsg
i failed my math exam today,btohqsg
id say a motor and a twistie string set up is pretty ridiculous,btohqsg
me failing is a meme la yes,btohqsg
but the motor sibei noisy eh,btohqsg
I spent a few mins playing with it,btohqsg
i was like huh y so loud,btohqsg
Perhaps that's why I couldn't finish the first part ah,btohqsg
I accidentally touched the resistor luckily my hands were dry,btohqsg
my friend sprayed disinfectant in my eye when wiping down,btohqsg
How many drew a curve instead of a line,btohqsg
they ask for gradient without any value of x,btohqsg
They literally told u in the qn its a line,btohqsg
I think they talking about the planning,btohqsg
I drew a line but quite a few people drew a curve,btohqsg
I love how my L1R5 is so limited becus of prac now,btohqsg
The qn said calculate the gradient of the LINE,btohqsg
no mass how to have gpe,btohqsg
i drew a line for planning,btohqsg
ur W 0 then P also 0,btohqsg
HAHAHA i dont intend to count physics so idc tbh,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure no one drew curve for planning,btohqsg
my physics theory is the worst,btohqsg
I genuinely think I'm gonna do worse than prelims,btohqsg
my practical is better idk why,btohqsg
yeah i failed all the way till prelims,btohqsg
Same I've not done a single practice paper before the prelims,btohqsg
Ah I'm more scared for chem,btohqsg
If I screw up chem L1R5 die already,btohqsg
i imagine its some dumbass prac weve never done before,btohqsg
chem wldnt be that far off,btohqsg
Pencil case on fire agn üî•,btohqsg
Im aiming for A1 so wtf,btohqsg
im aiming for A1 for mostly everyt tbh,btohqsg
Fml I'm prob gonna do worse for o levels than prelims,btohqsg
U got like 3 A1s no?,btohqsg
but phy at this state idk,btohqsg
I got 3 As but theyre okay ish,btohqsg
Ye but everyone says by os will improve,btohqsg
If u come up on the news as the top student i wont be surprised,btohqsg
i dont wanna believe in tt yet ba,btohqsg
Oh I thot u got A1 for everything. I wanted to ask u to tutor me,btohqsg
Did anyone teacher tried to spot the qn on chem prac,btohqsg
üòí We were in physics lab,btohqsg
Chem lab is on different level,btohqsg
Bruh my gradient is like 0.something,btohqsg
Graph supposed to start frm origin right?,btohqsg
Isint it suppose to be a about 12,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what our recent actions looks like too,btohqsg
You are writing in traditional Chinese  but this is wrong in traditional Chinese. Should be Ë£è or Ë£°,btohqsg
SBCS : Korean War ( Is Truman right to dismiss MacArthur ?),btohqsg
Essay : Rise of Stalin + Hitler‚Äôs expansionist policy,btohqsg
Next year might have Cold War or Asia Pacific or Korean War,btohqsg
anyone know whats going to come out for o level history,btohqsg
Atb for math guys 2 hours time,btohqsg
Bruh im still upset with physics prac,btohqsg

essay most likely hitler‚Äôs rise to power,btohqsg
i was thinking of korean war but there can be 2 possibilities now : its either they test a different part of korean war or they test cuban missile,btohqsg
Are you talking about pure or combined?,btohqsg
i take elec hist so idc abt core hist,btohqsg
I think its gonna be korean war too,btohqsg
ya they may test whos the aggressor,btohqsg
This year 70th anniversary of korean war so maybe they will test the start of korean war,btohqsg
bc hitler came out in 2015,btohqsg
they may follow the same trends idk,btohqsg
but to be safe jus study all,btohqsg
they may redo stalin bc 2018 tested only impacts of stalin‚Äôs rule and the policies,btohqsg
As long as it's not cmc,btohqsg
cuban may come out for sbq tbh,btohqsg
my cher say cuban fun but when i do im like nope,btohqsg
anyone knows how to improve physics paper2,btohqsg
tbh im j gonna memorise formulas and definitions and whack cos idn it,btohqsg
gain exposure to different types of qns,btohqsg
anyone collected the token thingy from the gov,btohqsg
what colors are there  i saw blue and grey only,btohqsg
Does anyone has the nlevel math paper,btohqsg
theres black?? wowsie u know which neighbourhood?,btohqsg
thOUGHT IT WAS AIRPOD CASE AT FIRST LMAOOO,btohqsg
yeh...my friend din even finish soz..,btohqsg
I forgot to tell you all,btohqsg
The total mark has been changed to 16,btohqsg
Paper 4 the total mark change to 29,btohqsg
16 because 4 questions are CLT and idk why one question is cancelled despite is not CLT ( air and atmosphere ),btohqsg
29 because one question in section A got one question about CLT,btohqsg
what was the original mark for paper 3 and 4,btohqsg
The paper however the percentage is still 50% of the total paper,btohqsg
So Cambridge would calculate like this : actual / 46 times 50,btohqsg
so do they add the remaining marks that were cancelled,btohqsg
The something out of 45 is like how much you score,btohqsg
The lower the total   the higher you get for your grades,btohqsg
So this year ahhhh..... VERY lucky,btohqsg
Less question   less total   more mark,btohqsg
However it comes with a price,btohqsg
üòÇwhich is my nightmare last time before Covid,btohqsg
to make up for the clt?,btohqsg
i heard n level sci got,btohqsg
Chemistry I think because want less stress hor,btohqsg
Chemistry the section B one must have organic chem,btohqsg
In math also same thing abit for section B,btohqsg
One of the section B question is about Circle angle,btohqsg
But because CLT   they modify it to a simple angle question idk,btohqsg
circle properties is hard but at the same time if uk how to do,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt know how to see,btohqsg
It takes a while to adapt to circles,btohqsg
my cher used like the cut out circles,btohqsg
Do you all use tap or clip burettes,btohqsg
he wants us to cut out 3 circles,btohqsg
then he used the circle to show the chord thing,btohqsg
i only know i use a burette lol,btohqsg
he did that for us to visualise ma,btohqsg
The tap/clip is what stops the solution in the burette from flowing out,btohqsg
I only know burette which is used to serve beer,btohqsg
then how u do chem pract,btohqsg
For the tap  u just loose the tap then the stuff will come out  but for clip you must press the clip,btohqsg
Does it really cost that much to switch to tap,btohqsg
i think the hardest chp in chem,btohqsg
My jc had tap burettes but the teachers said that we had to use the clip burettes cos our juniors were using the tap burettes,btohqsg
Shouldn‚Äôt the seniors get the better stuff pepeconcerned,btohqsg
Organic isn‚Äôt easy but it‚Äôs the most fun,btohqsg
i rlly like the eye tbh,btohqsg
memo & learn how to do diff q lor,btohqsg
pract papers r the key to everything for sciences,btohqsg
Does anyone have the chem and physics N level MCQ?,btohqsg
anyone have bio papers? can trade,btohqsg
Does anyone have the Physics N Level paper 2 answers? pls send thanks !!!,btohqsg

anyone have physics papers to trade?,btohqsg
can send the link? I cant find,btohqsg
Praise the lad Malthusian Trap#0055 for sending so many papers.,btohqsg
how do i add new papers into the drive?,btohqsg
Hi is there Any tips for O‚Äôs geography?,btohqsg
and learn how to answer different questions,btohqsg
e.g. trend   compare   desc & explain qns,btohqsg
If so  what the heck is that,btohqsg
iirc its when an element gets reduced and oxidised in the same reaction,btohqsg
its q stupid but u nvr know,btohqsg
does anyone have tips for o's pure chem qa?,btohqsg
Not in syllabus but they will describe what it is,btohqsg
yeah basically with enough info they can test anything :/,btohqsg
For colour of ppt in cation tests:Draw a tree and 4 clouds.Write ‚ÄúFe3+‚Äù on the tree trunk because it‚Äôs reddish-brownWrite ‚ÄúFe2+‚Äù on the canopy of leaves because they are greenWrite ‚ÄúAl3+‚Äù  ‚ÄúPb2+‚Äù  ‚ÄúZn2+‚Äù and ‚ÄúCa2+‚Äù in the 4 clouds because they are whiteWrite ‚ÄúCu2+‚Äù on the sky because it‚Äôs blueüòä,btohqsg
i guess... just record all the observations for all the steps u take.like write down the colour of precipitate formed if any? whether is it soluble (if they ask u to add in excess or add until there is no further change) colour of solution (colourless or blue  etc. if its a solution)? any effervescence formed? etc.can follow the qa notes given :),btohqsg
Oh ya and repeat more than 3 times if possible. In prelims  I did it 3 times and 2 of my answers were v close compared to the other one so I chose the 2 and took their average. Later did I realise that the correct answer was my first answer that I did not choose.,btohqsg
dont think there is enough time to do more than 3  usually 3 should be sufficient :),btohqsg
Depends on how u define best,btohqsg
Ima assume thats clerk but i assume pes a/b cant get that,btohqsg
does anyone have tips for chem planning?,btohqsg
Is there an ns faq or like a description for each vocatoon,btohqsg
but they got 300 risk pay la,btohqsg
Made by nsfs not by the saf,btohqsg
They give a rose tinted lens,btohqsg
But PES A and B can get into non-combat vocations,btohqsg
i had a few pes b1 clerks under me back in the day,btohqsg
Everytime i think a vocation is cool i search 'reddit singapore (vocation)' and i deselect it,btohqsg
anyone got poa papers can trade,btohqsg
The best vocations r quite obscure,btohqsg
Clerk still have to come in every day or so,btohqsg
Some people can somehow evade camp for a full month,btohqsg
But of course you have no choice,btohqsg
best vocation is to be a female,btohqsg
Best vocation is to take gelm,btohqsg
wau thank you so much for the recognition,btohqsg
u in discord pepeconcern ppl 24/7 u come here also want pepeconcern,btohqsg
it's ok john bb u won't have to pepeconcern me anymore,btohqsg
im gonna leave the server üòî,btohqsg
eh no la it's more like im not gonna use discord as much,btohqsg
I already muted and hid the channel,btohqsg
When I was studying for prelims I also quit the telegram chat,btohqsg
so don't miss me too much,btohqsg
This place used to be active,btohqsg
The syllabusOnly states usa's entry into the war and the over extension of hitlers army on many frontsDoes this mean other points like germanys heavy reliance on petroleum and ineffective command structure are not testedAnd also does that mean that Allied resistance causing germany's defeat is not tested,btohqsg
What have u made this server into?!?!?,btohqsg
sorry laurent!! I nvr take hist,btohqsg
Wasn‚Äôt in discord at the time,btohqsg
I joined recently cause my ns unit is 1.5h from home,btohqsg
but ya I not gonna talk in voicegen for quite some time HAHA,btohqsg
hold up then it means u more no life than me sia,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt quote ... gelm any more,btohqsg
Can tag me @ library but I will just pepeconcern u,btohqsg
JOHN is the epitome of pepeconcern,btohqsg
"so sorry for adding a random name I wonder who's the person that started w the letter ""d"" pfft",btohqsg
ok I almost forgot this isn't discord,btohqsg
Guys whats your prediction for planning,btohqsg
Just plan to fail  youll never go wrong,btohqsg
Can't fail at a plan if there isn't one in the 1st place,btohqsg
U all know hes a troll right,btohqsg
Nope. Dont know  but im act gonna fail so,btohqsg
I feel like its gonna turn out like physics,btohqsg
i think pendulum coming out too,btohqsg
are u dumb? when has that ever come out? bro???,btohqsg
electric motor is impossible to come out,btohqsg
How come still have physics practical?,btohqsg
ok dont send my face sorry,btohqsg
anyone knows what's the emb3 for applied chem in nyp?,btohqsg
well is there anyone that went there via pfp?,btohqsg
isnt that like your cca points?,btohqsg
I am not sure if you're referring to this. I got this from Nanyang poly website,btohqsg
Anyone has titration notes haha I memorise QA until forgot titration,btohqsg
just know how to record it in the table will do :),btohqsg
Just know that the acid goes into the conical flask at 25.0cm ^3 and the alkaline solution goes into the burette :),btohqsg
just follow the instructions given :),btohqsg
I just scared the solution is a mix of 2 compounds,btohqsg
my prelim is on mixture of two salts tho :/,btohqsg
My school paper prelim come out like inside sodium hydroxide solution there's 1g/dm3 of another compound dissolved then they titrate sodium hydroxide with that dissolved compound so it just messes up the eqn,btohqsg
And the physics prac SF everywhere this one I scared the numbers all weird but yolo I guess,btohqsg
just try yr best. good luck guys :),btohqsg
i wrote that hot air rises in the mantle to form convection currents lmao,btohqsg
materials in the mantle are heated up by the core causing them to expand   rise and spread out,btohqsg
I thought convectional current form due to difference in densities,btohqsg
Like hot air expand and rise,btohqsg
for ROR did yall draw line or curve,btohqsg
What is the other compound of R,btohqsg
or one of the spa carbobates,btohqsg
my classmates got different reading soz,btohqsg
They said displacement of water shldnt it be downward displacement,btohqsg
Then for the change in setup isit gas syringe,btohqsg
It‚Äôs your collection of gas method,btohqsg
U need use a glass jar to collect the gas,btohqsg
Btw what was your concentration of the acid ah,btohqsg
I go and use 1100 cm3,btohqsg
Erm I got something like that,btohqsg
But to calculate mr of sulfamine acid is take the vol of gas divided by 24dm3 then take mass of solid HA divide by no of mol right,btohqsg
But must do mole to mole ratio,btohqsg
But rmb to convert to dm3 first,btohqsg
Huh what thing need convert to dm3,btohqsg
but the rate of rxn avg for unit what yall write,btohqsg
theres no upward displacement of water,btohqsg
i put mg/min idt its correct,btohqsg
okay well all the best guys its over i guess left w bio now,btohqsg
Oh you took triple sci ah,btohqsg
I took double sci and double humans,btohqsg
bio cant predict whats coming out,btohqsg
Istg if you got pure lit or pure history,btohqsg
Which i will do it soon,btohqsg
Sg flag is not the only thing that is hanging outside,btohqsg
U can narrow down based on the past 2 yr olevels prac,btohqsg
gg liao my chem is shit smh,btohqsg
Yea lol I changed to g/sec,btohqsg
And I thought it‚Äôs too simple if u use mg/min,btohqsg
But it should be correct too,btohqsg
Bruh I put soluble salt as copper(ii) carbonate,btohqsg
oh i found the data abt bordeaux and burgundy,btohqsg
mine is way far off this,btohqsg
