i will never be done with them,btohqsg
Or better still  she will treat studying with you as a date.,btohqsg

for ri and hci is diff,btohqsg
cause theirs is 400 ip boy 400 ip girl 400 jae,btohqsg
then for ip minority schools like tjc it's about 1:3,btohqsg
then for ip majority like dhs rvhs is like 3.5:1,btohqsg
i got a friend from sge dc from tj also,btohqsg
so the dynamics are very diff,btohqsg
there was a program to befriend the jaes,btohqsg
like ip ppl will sign up to be befrienders and be like buddies to jaes during ori,btohqsg
but i observed that alot of the befrienders signed up because they will put you and ur friend in 1 og if you guys sign up tgt,btohqsg
what if you're below average in everything,btohqsg
then during ori they js talk to each other,btohqsg
how about three of us + kuro just divide and conquer,btohqsg
I think tm is ard 860 for my batch (?) ‚Äî> was 600+ before merger,btohqsg
comparison is never endingThough no one is below average in everythingIt can always be categorised in a way that you are above average.Statistics are lies,btohqsg
Guys how to get over ending a relationship with your girl best friend,btohqsg
She js ended things with me and I don‚Äôt think my heart can ever recover,btohqsg
Ngl the first most obvious shit is to give yourself time to get it outta your system,btohqsg
2nd is reflect on what went wrong  be it on u or her or both,btohqsg
3rd is repeat 1st and 2nd step till you're somewhat certain of wtf is going on then you buckle up and pull up your socks,btohqsg
Suck it up and get over it,btohqsg
Cause by then no use crying over spilt milk,btohqsg
And also you have way btr shit to do and spend that remaining time of yours doing way more productive shit,btohqsg
Also there's many other fishes in the ocean or wtv however the phrase goes,btohqsg
can learn how to scam people,btohqsg
but she is the fish i want then how,btohqsg
Theres same type of fish everywhere,btohqsg
gude has literally been there for damn long,btohqsg
and i wonder why im fat,btohqsg
hell nah whats w the windpipes,btohqsg
you die die must/want the 90?,btohqsg
yt replace the left with econs A,btohqsg
Write a program to illustrate the 4 key regimes in the logistic map  mainly  extinction  equilibrium  limit cyle and chaos. Your output should consist of side-by-side subplots (time series on the left and phase plot on the right) for each behaviour type. You may discard the transient data from all the time series plots.,btohqsg
how to chatgpt tmr without being caught,btohqsg
im so not ready for gp tmr,btohqsg
i dun understand the purpose of coding math stuff,btohqsg
idk what he doing half the time,btohqsg
that's like 80% of gp cher,btohqsg
the teacher that got whacked by my parents,btohqsg
is it he not teaching or u nvr lsiten,btohqsg
or u dont understand what he saying,btohqsg
coz gp was something i hate the most anyway,btohqsg
i only know macro n micro reading,btohqsg
i was getting D-E throughout lmao,btohqsg
but managed a C at As (honestly what i was hoping for in the first place),btohqsg
coz what i want is just to NOT do english in uni,btohqsg
im going to get U for gp,btohqsg
and from what i heard from my friend  it is a waste time mod,btohqsg
i heard the gp syllabus changed? from class of 2025,btohqsg
meanwhile  in my coding project 1  the prof wrote there that he accepts if u just solely use mathematical reasoning,btohqsg
also ks mstj statistics a lot of coding,btohqsg
bc i dont likr cs stuff,btohqsg
taking H3 math have pushed me far far away from doing math in uni,btohqsg
but on the bright side  i got to enjoy vinson lim's teaching,btohqsg
S101 got him (idk which other classes),btohqsg
actually what was the requirement to qualify for H3,btohqsg
i dun even know how i qualified for math,btohqsg
All the best! Can one  tbh i did not expect an A and was shooked,btohqsg
then ms tang be 'nonsense la u  i expected an A from you',btohqsg
on its own it's kinda redundant but it's useful in a lot of applications,btohqsg
Yes. But it‚Äôs from this year onwards,btohqsg
i think the math part is making this coding shit more complicated,btohqsg
this is not even surprising lmao once you pick up some coding they will at times expect you to use it. not just one and done,btohqsg
I thought the new syllabus seems harder except for saq,btohqsg
wait wait there is saq now?,btohqsg
Cos language marks now don‚Äôt take into account saq anymore,btohqsg
Meaning students can answer in point form and save time,btohqsg
what is saq  omg i feel damn old now,btohqsg
well yea certain aspects of coding are more reliant on math than others,btohqsg
Or maybe s stands for structured,btohqsg
i only remembered editting  some essay  comprehension  summary,btohqsg
that's why i avoided discussing econs in the gc üòé,btohqsg
I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll get B for Econs honestly,btohqsg
my friend got merit for h3 econs but c for h2 econs,btohqsg
i really feel so shit for her,btohqsg
Moe extend each paper by 15 mins for the new syllabus but I still couldn‚Äôt complete lol,btohqsg
A level can whack point form actually,btohqsg
I thought that‚Äôs only for csq data response questions,btohqsg
Used to be 2h15mins per paper for h2 then it became 2h30mins,btohqsg
what i did to finish the paper --> my econs teacher gave me this hack,btohqsg
i straight up ask her how to finish the paper,btohqsg
H1 less marks but same amount of time,btohqsg
but i only did point form for the last qns where seriously time was short,btohqsg
i think coz it is 2 case studies,btohqsg
tbh econs bell curve is not that steep,btohqsg
bell curve god can safe u,btohqsg
aight i forgot  for us  only full marks allowed,btohqsg
guys rmb we are Asians not Bsians,btohqsg
that's... a stressful mindset to have,btohqsg
like that how...90% of TM gg,btohqsg
They have a 3h paper so can‚Äôt extend more. 3h is the longest for any h1/h2 paper. Only h3 Econs goes up to 3h15mins,btohqsg
im going to grt U guys,btohqsg
bro your pes not even pes A,btohqsg
Yeah but like my Econs was always within the top 10 percentile in the cohort so like,btohqsg
It‚Äôs gonna be a huge fall from grace lol,btohqsg
oh lol  mine was consistently D and 0-20 percentileüòé,btohqsg
i guess we are on different levels,btohqsg
im clueless about tm stats  please enlighten me,btohqsg
You got B in the end is it,btohqsg
principal did not announce during my A level results,btohqsg
dude i would be happy with just a C man,btohqsg
I thought you said GP and PW were your only As,btohqsg
but my batch did quite badly,btohqsg
it sucks when i was 0-20 for the entire year  and i witness my friends go from D to C to B at prelims üíÄ,btohqsg
lol this guy keeps lying idk what to believe,btohqsg
I‚Äôll just take it that he‚Äôs vjc 90rp,btohqsg
actually internal exam  H2 math and econs have v few As,btohqsg
i got a friend from vj,btohqsg
i had B for H2 econs in one of the exam and was number 5 sia,btohqsg
Vjc acad results always very good,btohqsg
Only some depts not very good,btohqsg
But overall a pretty good sch,btohqsg
but i not pes A üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
even my blood group also not A,btohqsg
my batch tm only had 6 perfect scorers but i dunno who they are,btohqsg
another friend of mine also went from D to A then the 2 of us went and rubbed it on our econs tutor's face lol,btohqsg
im 2019 batch (the one that got terribly ill treated by pam yoong),btohqsg
yr legit smurfing the sg education system,btohqsg
George w bush once said ‚ÄúFull me once  shame on - shame on you. Fool me tw- you can‚Äôt fool me again.‚Äù,btohqsg
how is this chat messaging nonstop,btohqsg
instead of eureka  we say owadio,btohqsg
it's called - a level results coping mechanism yknow,btohqsg
so who is receiving their results this friday,btohqsg
even tho most people not taking results,btohqsg
me + bedok + siyan because we clearing subjects,btohqsg
i actually dreamt that i had BCCB,btohqsg
oh you mean subjects taken in J1?,btohqsg
results day i was happy for the early book out man  results only hit when i sat down in the hall,btohqsg
And then how much you got in the end?,btohqsg
as in we retaking a level until we clear all the subjects available,btohqsg
im planning to take all 4 language subjects,btohqsg
i got AAA/AWhat i regretted was looking at reddit reviews  and counting marks lost,btohqsg
yea just don‚Äôt do that like it‚Äôs pointless,btohqsg
i remembered i was lying on the floor mourning after chem or sth,btohqsg
reddit is low-key like urban dictionary social media ver,btohqsg
At least you got into your dream uni course,btohqsg
actually me too...i used that to count marks,btohqsg
i read reddit to feed on everyone‚Äôs tears,btohqsg
i was more toxic   whenever i messed up  i just went on to reddit to see people messing up even more than i did to comfort myself,btohqsg
it is damn funny i have been seeing a lot asking how are jc class names come up,btohqsg
oh yea i use that to guage how others feel of the paper  then if everyone also die  i feel better,btohqsg
we all are the same üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
what are they thinking  going on reddit to make friends too,btohqsg
but thing is  you won't see top scorers on reddit also mah,btohqsg
"like ""im hci top scorer and the paper was friggin easy""",btohqsg
If only moe released the grade boundaries  then we can roughly tell whether our estimates are correct,btohqsg
those people after paper go back mug,btohqsg
people also downvote to oblivion those that think the paper is easy,btohqsg
Because without the grade boundaries we won‚Äôt even able to tell whether we over estimated or underestimate our raw marks,btohqsg
curved is not the word for it,btohqsg
So they should release it every year,btohqsg
doesn't matter  just get full marks,btohqsg
i gave up on estimating  it is always wrong,btohqsg
ok yes  my fm friends also said the same thing,btohqsg
"the paper over  everyone ""eh why the paper so easy this time""",btohqsg
i dun dare to say any paper is easy,btohqsg
i wish i had fm as an option back then sia,btohqsg
anyone remembers 2022 h2 bio P3 dinosaur question here ü§°,btohqsg
wait actually wdym by retaking A levels and clearing all subjects left (like subjects y'all didnt take in jc?),btohqsg
i want to relive jc but not the As part,btohqsg
I heard it‚Äôs around $600 but depends on the subjects,btohqsg
i remmebered my chem teacher telling me a wise advice,btohqsg
to not care about my practical and focus on my written,btohqsg
jokes aside  i agree with this,btohqsg
basically telling me to give up 20% of the paper,btohqsg
oh wait  30 years to ord,btohqsg
idt i wanna relive jc so ill just stay where i am,btohqsg
retaking a levels is like redemption for no reason LOL,btohqsg
i wanna relive is becoz 1/2 of it got robbed away by pam yoong,btohqsg
eh but you did get A sobecause my chem cher said the As graders  practicals pull them down a bit because A graders usually do well for pracbut for B graders  practicals pull them up from their writtenso likely your practicals was yummy yummy,btohqsg
a level is like ns  you do 1 time good 1,btohqsg
i think my batch is the only batch and sch that simple stats is not announced (pam yoong just talked over PA for < 10s),btohqsg
what if i retake physics but just throw the practical,btohqsg
see how well i can do,btohqsg
this + the fact my batch had to settle in class rm coz of covid,btohqsg
eh that's another challenge we can do sia,btohqsg
yes my practical pulled me down...i got D for prelim practical,btohqsg
only if we know our exact score smh,btohqsg
we can try like exactly 50% for all subjects,btohqsg
no practical and half the time,btohqsg
Yes it was a subtle acknowledgment by seab they never gave enough time for Econs in the first place,btohqsg
Probably a lot of incomplete scripts Cambridge examiners had to mark every year,btohqsg
LOL uni can but jc fml,btohqsg
yea i think more than half my class cant finish the paper,btohqsg
everything symbolic in terms of the variables,btohqsg
Well even with the extension it‚Äôs still not enough,btohqsg
but did it go from 2.5 - 2h15 - 2.5 again,btohqsg
idk i vaguely remembered it being 2.5h in my batch,btohqsg
i think it is a nationwide issue xD,btohqsg
Huh since when tho. All the TYS papers I saw were 2h15,btohqsg
vj ban mian was from the old tampines jc,btohqsg
I was in shooting but i cant shoot (coz idk where to go  wanted band but my parents wun let me),btohqsg
meanwhile im going to drown in coding class tmr,btohqsg
i was fr band in sec,btohqsg
fml im lazy to carry myself to school tmr,btohqsg
Mood. One lesson and i dont wanna turn up,btohqsg
i think i wun survive without chatgpt tmr,btohqsg
Omg guys frozen bananas are actually so good wtf,btohqsg

i realised that math is my strong point,btohqsg
iw to take h3 math so i can get uni scholarship,btohqsg
since i omly hv 3 h2 1 h1,btohqsg
i dun think h3 math matters a lot? Im not sure coz i got ungraded omo,btohqsg
rank point also doesnt guarantee  i didnt get nus scholarship lmao...ghosted me,btohqsg
my H3 no use coz i ended up w a U for H3 lmao,btohqsg
the number of AKs i got in baccarat,btohqsg
oh yea i heard ntu easier to get scholarship,btohqsg
not that it will do anything i just want nice nuber,btohqsg
my friend got ntu scholarship but didnt get nus scholarship so she chose ntu instead,btohqsg
so 3 h2 1 h1 AAA/A enough for scholarship?,btohqsg
and + it is always in the late afternoon after ur lessons,btohqsg
i heard some ppl sya nedd,btohqsg
well i did not get it,btohqsg
