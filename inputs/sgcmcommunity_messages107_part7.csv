Just requires a bit of route planning  there is extensive research on the charging points and mileage within the ev community. Honestly I rather be stuck in a jam in an ev than a fuel guzzler. And with autopilot  jams are much less stressful.,btohqsg
Depends on what u are after  cash back or miles,btohqsg
Haha cashback bah. Miles not my thing yet,btohqsg
I think the highest is 8% cash back with Citi cash back+,btohqsg
Overall discount is not the highest though I think 20+%,btohqsg

Trust card or esso app would have $4 or $6 vouchers  save more than the lalamove app,btohqsg

Yeah. Used to have every month. This month strangely Esso never give the vouchers,btohqsg
I'll let you know if have..,btohqsg
It’s okay  I love my lalamove X sinopec,btohqsg
Last year every month there's vouchers from esso lol,btohqsg
Now is trust bank and then there's the caltex $6 vouchers when you sign up safra complimentary membership,btohqsg
I haven't been using my lalamove card for many months lol,btohqsg
I think this month due to vouchers for buying abalone etc in their star mart,btohqsg
Quite a few EV owners going up north recently tbh,btohqsg

For taycans the new Porsche center at JB will help with the fast chargers installed outside the dealer,btohqsg
