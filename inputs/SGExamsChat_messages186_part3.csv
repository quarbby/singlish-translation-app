They still never release the plan for the new jpjc to the people yet,btohqsg
but heard that the cmi ones go to the ACJC,btohqsg
hmmm im not too sure ah,btohqsg
Anyone can send combine science 2019 and 2018 chem pdf,btohqsg
but thats what i heard at least,btohqsg
Also not mine  but to be fair this jc aint rich either,btohqsg
Our library is 2 storeys  but the second storey is literally just tables and chairs,btohqsg
Nett 8 can go ACJC or need lower?,btohqsg
i can't even go close to a 5 storey library now =.=,btohqsg
At that point  why wouldn't you just donate a bit more to go to the better school ACSI,btohqsg
5k is enough to go ACSI,btohqsg
Got 2 cca and higher mt,btohqsg
but if 5k brings u to poverty,btohqsg
that's where you gonna get shit on,btohqsg
ur classmates in ACSI will end up buying you,btohqsg
Ur school fees in ACSI will go beyond 5k,btohqsg
if u consider a year  probs,btohqsg
JC school fees definitely cheaper then poly right,btohqsg
Poly is RI and HCI fee,btohqsg
lowkey 1 reason why i chose jc,btohqsg
I heard ri one is like $300?,btohqsg
imagine paying $30 ish a month,btohqsg
But most likely wont change right? It hasnt changed for quite a while i think.,btohqsg
just for a chance to get a paid scholarship,btohqsg
And somemore when you come uni  you have to pay for 4 years of uni instead of 3 years for poly,btohqsg
Every non private JC abt there what,btohqsg
But there's a scholarship for JC kids who go to independent schools,btohqsg
Tbh I come to JC just to finish army,btohqsg
If u poly u have direct Y2 entry so the net time spent is still the same,btohqsg
but the cost spent is greater,btohqsg
I rather come to uni quicker,btohqsg
So that I can end immediately,btohqsg
Poly cost is like a drop in the ocean compared to uni,btohqsg
Not sure  you can look it up,btohqsg
"what are the ""slack"" JCs I heard of",btohqsg
I think it is abt $2000,btohqsg
But I personally wouldn't advise going for slack CCA,btohqsg
If you choose the right CCA  your JC life will be much more interesting,btohqsg
theres weekly weekend activites for interact members,btohqsg
Yea...no not for mine I think,btohqsg
i clearly chose the wrong one,btohqsg
My cca comm now slack as i only need to plan and everyone cmi,btohqsg
Interact is for if you want to deal with CCA and VIA in one shot,btohqsg
so any random plan i give also can one so idc,btohqsg
Also  if u didn't know CCA is actually not compulsory in JC,btohqsg
i do more than the welfare comm leader,btohqsg
but our principal forced everyone into the gulags,btohqsg
No one will chase u if u don't have CCA,btohqsg
but CCA definitely helps for portfolio boosting in university apps,btohqsg
CCA is a way to get leadership experience,btohqsg
