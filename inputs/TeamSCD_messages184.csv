If not i wont be able to afford a car at that kind of age,btohqsg
23 or 24 nia got car alr.,btohqsg
I shared installments with my dad until he retrenched. Then i solo buy own car,btohqsg
It's the very reason why i have very little savings.,btohqsg
from before stepping into society alr paying for installments,btohqsg
We dont talk about savings in this community,btohqsg
Ok i'm gonna go Garage R alr,btohqsg
You all see why i want to own a new and problem free car now?,btohqsg
Its like u are servicing every 1k,btohqsg
I cant see your perspective from my rotary,btohqsg
Today I received a dreadful sms,btohqsg
Honestly the road tax is less scary than the inspection,btohqsg
Yeah that one also recently did,btohqsg
If already inspect then ok what,btohqsg
Inspection I not worried... Sure pass,btohqsg
But $908 I can buy many things,btohqsg
If only u could keep your horsepower but pay 858 sgd per entire year,btohqsg
If the depre is lower than 24k can pitch to@Zc31s_Cleopatra,btohqsg

Our friend bobby open up his boot with a sub woofer inside and blast  then he left the meet. Police came down with security guards from opposite condo  said residents complain about music being blasted. Took down the organizer name and the meet was ended.,btohqsg
Who rude?? Here got a few people involvedBobbySecurity guardResidentsPoliceOrganizer,btohqsg
snitches get stitches lets light up that residential area,btohqsg
same vibes as your tone deaf neighbour singing karaoke,btohqsg
"if you do it at some ulu location  or day time it would still be ""understandable""",btohqsg
but opposite a condo isn't the wisest of ideas,btohqsg
First time there  last time there as well,btohqsg

Food attracts. Otherwise  sometimes they crawl into the car if parked beside rubbish bin  long kang. etc,btohqsg
maggots also just appear out of nowhere one,btohqsg
No I mean how they enter the car not why,btohqsg
I saw 1 on my dashboard 1 year ago. Immediately call for fumigation.,btohqsg
Air con vents etc. Sure have some holes ma,btohqsg
I see before in army  the dustbin nobody clear,btohqsg
2 weeks only got maggots alr,btohqsg
dont even know where it come from,btohqsg
Those people do experiment one. They keep food sealed in a container,btohqsg
What you mean you can't drive a manual whilst eating,btohqsg
I use my left hand to hold the food item   then upshift using the back of my hand,btohqsg

Every car in sg can be a midlife crisis car,btohqsg
But the good morning pictures are very nissan sunny/prefacelift camry/GLX energy,btohqsg
I think it screams harrier energy,btohqsg
Perfect for the midlife crisis boomers that wants an euro SUV but can only afford a harrier.,btohqsg
The price gap between harrier and cayenne is almost nonexistent depending on model year,btohqsg
Young man half my age wakes up 5 hours after me and says tired af  you?,btohqsg

mx5 can buy a hardtop right,btohqsg
But roi is already changing car,btohqsg
but if i buy hardtop means i'll lose the top-down drive alr,btohqsg
Isnt it the hardtop can also fold down,btohqsg
Or it requires more mods at the rear to make the space,btohqsg
If it's the power retractable one yes,btohqsg
If it's soft top  you buy hard top,btohqsg
it's 1 big piece like this,btohqsg
Cant u spray a hydrophobic layer,btohqsg
The kind they spray on sneakers,btohqsg

I think it says 3 months in the bottle,btohqsg
They told me 1 year spray 1 time can alr,btohqsg
No it says 6 months to 1 year,btohqsg
If every 3 months  it's alot of work sia,btohqsg
I'll probably have to order a new bottle and spray it once the weather clears up again,btohqsg
Its like all the things u tell me u love,btohqsg
I get anxiety everytime it rains,btohqsg

Then walk out to the carpark and thats the camry,btohqsg
