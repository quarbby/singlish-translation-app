You can ask them directly. My last conversation in person  the installer said it. You can clarify with them if you wish. It's your choice in getting which mat that suits you.,btohqsg

I find this better to vaccum up sands,btohqsg
I also have this. Suction not strong enough,btohqsg
You need 19000Pa and above suction. Airbot iroom 1.0 is 19000Pa,btohqsg
This is not good for car vacuum use,btohqsg
But this is too big. Not suitable for portable car use right,btohqsg
I have this too. 15500Pa not strong.take some time to vacuum up sands.,btohqsg
Do a good search. My friend bought 24000Pa car vacuum. $360 expensive 😂,btohqsg
Don't buy wire car vacuum. I had the black and decker one. Burn my fuse twice.,btohqsg
