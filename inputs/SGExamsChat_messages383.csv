if its graded ill actl kms,btohqsg
That ‘s a head spinning effect,btohqsg
i mean it looks ok... but,btohqsg
it doesnt relate to the theme,btohqsg
Hv 1 long ass bullet point para in ur slides,btohqsg

even had to type put the script for them,btohqsg
This one done by my grp mates in uni,btohqsg
Also hv no idea wtf they doin,btohqsg
Compared to the flowery one also,btohqsg
yellow fonts are the ugliest shit i have seen on project slides,btohqsg
+ random background pics that dont make sense,btohqsg
and the para is so lengthy,btohqsg
I would say it's not bad also,btohqsg
like whats the point of you being there then???,btohqsg
white background and black font is the best,btohqsg
ya it was smth like this but even worse,btohqsg
Put too much words and your audience won't listen to what you are saying,btohqsg
This was the one i redid,btohqsg
Rip forgot to blank out names,btohqsg
im doing some colour blind test,btohqsg
my eyes tired from looking at my screen alr,btohqsg
I removed it. That one was quite bad.,btohqsg
In Excel   the similar function is Conditional formatting.,btohqsg
make the slides also very funny one,btohqsg
My lecturers put out very ugly slides,btohqsg
i rmb being so mad at the start of sec 3,btohqsg
all the slides to white background and black text,btohqsg
Good for studying at night in a dark room,btohqsg
From far look like some kind of food?,btohqsg

my sbq was Supposed to be my strong point but,btohqsg
i had no time and also i didnt rly understand this topic's sources well,btohqsg
u didnt have a ss teacher?,btohqsg
i feel so bad bcs my ss teacher marked my extra practice and i still didnt do well for o lvl,btohqsg
i had the same english and sci teacher from p3-p6 so,btohqsg
he was also my form teacher,btohqsg
the first teacher to be forgotten,btohqsg
wasnt it ur class that emath amath all a1,btohqsg
i think the average was c6 and below...,btohqsg
f9 f9 f9 d7 e8 f9,btohqsg
how much did u get for ss,btohqsg
at first i wasnt happy w my score bcs my ss was supposed to b better,btohqsg
then i saw the marksheet and i was like nvm .,btohqsg
full marks for the forst 2 or 3 qns,btohqsg
and i feel like i didnt study much aft my prelims 💀💀,btohqsg
in sec 3 we had an ss teacher who was in her first year of teaching ssit was very fun bc we could do well cos she married very leniently and we could get 10/10 for tests and stuffthen she left bc she was also an art teacher and she felt that our school not enough art things to doso the new teacher in sec 4 was very loud and annoying and so strict that our marks dropped to 2/10,btohqsg
we also change ss teacher but im ok w both,btohqsg
if liddat my o lvl die liao,btohqsg
What school if u don’t mind me asking,btohqsg
did u find our prelim paper was same standard as o lvl,btohqsg
idk i didnt do tys before prelims,btohqsg
prelim was easier than o lvl,btohqsg
Oh Anderson sec papers q tough I feel,btohqsg
how much did u get for,btohqsg
i never go ask people their score,btohqsg
i did econs paper 1 for fun,btohqsg
i didn't write the value of the motor vehicles,btohqsg
I DID SO BADLY FOR THAT PAPER,btohqsg
our school prelim set very hard,btohqsg
MY FIRST TIME ECONS GOT B4 SIA,btohqsg
Oh u mean financial statement ah,btohqsg
i did the 2021 p1 LOL,btohqsg
then i nvr write the value,btohqsg
Bruh everyone in my class calculate their marks around 50+ for p2,btohqsg
so i lost one mark in total,btohqsg
usually i can score q high,btohqsg
also i heard the mr lim guy a bitch,btohqsg
i didnt know until recently but,btohqsg
i actl plaved tkgs as my 4th choice,btohqsg
which meant i would have prob taken econs too if i went to tkgs,btohqsg
Didn’t know o level got Econs lol,btohqsg
like the money economics should be under poa right....,btohqsg
i made a bad choice in sec 2,btohqsg
i woyld have went with triple sci at least,btohqsg
i can delay picking between bio and phy,btohqsg
anyways its quite messed up also coz,btohqsg
mr lim wasnt even teaching OUR CLASS,btohqsg
O level Chinese they will take ur best grade right ?,btohqsg
i would rather triple sci then,btohqsg
U CANT USE ECONS TO REPLACE COMB HUMANS.,btohqsg
im gonna take h2 econs for sure,btohqsg
i js hope i can even make it to jc now,btohqsg
although i think econs prob easier to score a1 as compared to phy,btohqsg
now i cant even take a bridging course if i want to take a phy related course in uni,btohqsg
but bio to physics i think its a lot harder,btohqsg
chances r very low even if i take h2 phy,btohqsg
1. parents need to approve2. school need to approve3. need to self study o lvl pure phy in 3 months4. continue dying in jc....,btohqsg
for chem i think i might go with h2 first... but maybe drop to h1 if i rly cmi...,btohqsg
coz my chem foundation q weak,btohqsg
YA MR KANG JS LEFT SUDDENLY SIA,btohqsg
I MEAN YEAH HIS LESSONS ARE BORING AF,btohqsg
BUT BETTER THAN MR LIM... (like i understand mr lim teaching method is q useful coz it forces students to use active recall BUT im not used to it since WE SUDDENLY CHANGE TCHR),btohqsg
I think q hard to self study in 3 months la,btohqsg
"""i was so glad i can take a break from teaching graduating students but now i have to teach again"" or smth along those lines...",btohqsg
true idk also i most likely gonna stick with h2 bio,btohqsg
plus not all the schs allow students to take h2 phy without prior o lvl knowledge 💀💀,btohqsg
they say frm combi sci to h2 sci is alr hard,btohqsg
then if u hv 0 knowledge gg liao,btohqsg
i got one friend didnt do Bio in Sec sch  den go JC take H2 Bio H2 Chem,btohqsg
have to request and all i think was ASRJC,btohqsg
i mean i have phy o level textbook...,btohqsg
but if i doesnt work out then ill js accept my fate to do h2 bio LMAO,btohqsg
i dont think my parents will allow me to take also,btohqsg
coz my dad quite against me going to jc in the first place 💀💀,btohqsg
i think he will actually kill me,btohqsg
he thinks im more suited for poly,btohqsg
and that i cant make it in jc,btohqsg
"then he also mentions how much my brother struggled in jc  let alone me who is ""less smart"" as compared to him",btohqsg
idk maybe coz i like arts and humanities better,btohqsg
doesnt really matter to me anymkre,btohqsg
i have no idea if this is a scammer or a bored person,btohqsg
he told my brother the same thing about how,btohqsg
he wont make it in sec sch  in jc  in ns  in uni,btohqsg
i considered it... but i think to bridge the gap from elect hist to h2 hist is quite huge...,btohqsg
my most likely subj combi id have to take is HELM,btohqsg
h2 lit is a nightmare and my english tchr advised not to take it LMAO,btohqsg
my english not that strong in the first place,btohqsg
is it abt the gp or sth,btohqsg
for now... i think ill prob stick with BCME,btohqsg
if i cant make it to sci stream,btohqsg
maybe hybrid or HELM (idk about h2 lit tho),btohqsg
if i cant make it to jc then poly,btohqsg
i havent thought about what courses to take,btohqsg
i thought of taking h2 hist and geog,btohqsg
but i think thats also crazy,btohqsg
Eh u wan do STEM for a career or more artsy shit,btohqsg
i dont want anything to do with sci and math in the future 💀💀,btohqsg
what kind of artsy shit u doin,btohqsg
Artsy shit no need take hybrid ah,btohqsg
J go str8 for arts course,btohqsg
Arts rp req usually easier mah,btohqsg
I had most fun doin geog,btohqsg
i scared i limit my choices only HAHAHA,btohqsg
eh i lowkey wan agree but um,btohqsg
at least if i take sci strean,btohqsg
thats why its also like my,btohqsg
when i was sec 2 i wanted to take pure humans,btohqsg
but my sch didnt offer pure hist + elect geog,btohqsg
as in if you dowan do sci and math in future   then just arts in jc ah,btohqsg
If u not good at mathy shit u get shit rp for As is worse than taking artsy shit and getting decent grades for As,btohqsg
isnt it quite risky though... idk,btohqsg
U choose a course gg locked in alr,btohqsg
yeah but going to arts stream means i got a lot more things i need to cover coz i didnt take pure humans stream in sec sch mah,btohqsg
i think i naturally better at humanities as compared to sciences but its like,btohqsg
since i picked sci stream in sec sch,btohqsg
eh depends on how linked h2 content is compared to sec sch lor,btohqsg
might as well continue with it,btohqsg
and that one need the arts people to answer LOL,btohqsg
i even considered trying out HSP 💀💀 but idk,btohqsg
doesnt art stream mean 3 arts subj and 1 contrast?,btohqsg
i cant take art stream either way LOL,btohqsg
i dont even want to argue with him at this point,btohqsg
aft life regrets of trip sci,btohqsg
i mean i understand where hes coming from  its just my relationship with him not so good la,btohqsg
Or hybrid if u legit legit unsure,btohqsg
i cant run away frm math can i,btohqsg
i think math is a must...,btohqsg
i wld unironically do anyt to run away frm math,btohqsg
i wld go poly if i knew what i wanted to do,btohqsg
Unless u do some mega artsy shit,btohqsg
i mean we all hate smth,btohqsg
i js want to go jc,btohqsg
i think about jc also scared liao,btohqsg
i js need to get into jc pls,btohqsg
but poly is prob even worse 💀💀,btohqsg
"esp when i see ppl say ""i can get 6 pts""",btohqsg
I can teach yall how to survive jc math,btohqsg
YAand idk what to even do,btohqsg
like i hv a uni course in mind,btohqsg
and poly wont lead me there,btohqsg
unless i enter those reallly good courses,btohqsg
I did jc math like i did humanities  i just memorized the steps to doing the qn w/o understanding,btohqsg
i dont even have a uni course in mind 🫠🫠,btohqsg
U cant get A but can probs get a B,btohqsg
some ppl hv their whole life mapped out alr,btohqsg
aiya even j2s after alevel still dk,btohqsg
I didn't figure out until in army,btohqsg
actually thats why im going jc bcs my dream keeps changing every semester,btohqsg
I can give u a very very nice path,btohqsg
And take pol sci/ minor in philo,btohqsg
the biggest challenge is being an intentional student LOL,btohqsg

"""What is the biggest problem you have ever faced?""""Being a foreign student""",btohqsg
but my grades how to fake,btohqsg
it is impending my life decisions,btohqsg

HAHA ya have 2 more yrs,btohqsg
but i think my parents wld be against it tbh,btohqsg
Philo is fun ah but cannot feed urself,btohqsg
Tbh in sg a professional degree is safer fr,btohqsg
Unless you craft a niche area for yourself to create artificial demand ;),btohqsg
but i rly dont see myself going into stem tbh,btohqsg
If u do that j go do business bro,btohqsg
i will realise physics is my true calling,btohqsg
isnt it if u do ns then its easier to get citizenship?,btohqsg
I'm good fam  everyone's wanting to flock there these days,btohqsg

I thought if ns can ez citizenship,btohqsg
lol when i got my pr i need sign the form to acknowledge that i need go ns,btohqsg

like if they dw to be citizen they wld have cancelled their pr and fly away alr,btohqsg

imagine u in a job then u need to go sg for some business thing,btohqsg
"""sorry im a crimminal in sg""",btohqsg
"""do u have a criminal record?""""yes i ran away without serving ns""",btohqsg

Look at accounting records  verify its correct,btohqsg

'i identify as i instead of pocoyo',btohqsg

Y’all ever had a 40+ year old try to guilt you into giving them seat on mrt,btohqsg
Like bruh you are not that old,btohqsg
I was a lot more courteous to people on the mrt lol,btohqsg
even if I'm traveling from punggol to harbourfront,btohqsg
"he stand there then ""tsk tsk""",btohqsg
but it’s like if you really need it,btohqsg

Fuck off auntie you don’t know my life,btohqsg

ngl she looked fitter than me,btohqsg
my parents still think im short too tho,btohqsg

I spread my legs wider and push them LOL,btohqsg
Not just uncle uh. Some guys also do that.,btohqsg
Yea. Then just stare back at them.,btohqsg
Side note but in NTU our campus bus still need wear mask  and it’s quite cathartic to see people try to sneak up without wearing,btohqsg
Then get chased off by the bus uncle,btohqsg
does it rly matter wear or not? it's js safety precaution ntg so cool with a mask off,btohqsg
I thought mask wearing is for all shared transport except Grab,btohqsg
no la as in those who insist on not wearing,btohqsg
got this one uncle on my bus nvr wear mask the bus driver came all the way to the back to tell him off,btohqsg
