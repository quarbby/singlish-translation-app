Hi guys did anyone take the dnt n level paper ?,btohqsg
i just want to know how yall feel about the paper 😅,btohqsg
Sorry for the late night text but i am really helpless and lonely so i can only think of seeking opinions from this groupchat  hello i am currently 17 and was a student from jurong west secondary who took secondary 4 express in 2023 (last year) and took o levels. I failed some subjects so i decided to retake my o levels as private candidate and i did well this year HOWEVER i am missing either science or computing to pass to get into a good poly I did not apply for any of those subject exams for this year O levels so im thinking if i can apply for another year of O level as a private candidate for the SECOND time meaning i will be 18 next year  in order to get that one subject to go into a good polytechnic or jc. Also really confused if i retake as Private again for... 2nd time will i have to go for NS as i will be 18 NEXT YEAR. PLEASE HELP I AM REALLY SCARED OF MY LIFE PLS PLS,btohqsg
did u pass maths last year,btohqsg
If i am able to retake as private candidate again next year for 2025 can i still use my o level grades from 2024 and 2023? And will i need to attend NS if i take as private candidate?,btohqsg
i’m 17 too… some of my peers are 24 and even 49… udh to worry… u can fit in,btohqsg
udh to apply… if im not wrong  they take both yrs result,btohqsg
u can call poly admission centre to double check,btohqsg
Yes you are able to combine results,btohqsg
Afaik o level does not have an expiry,btohqsg
But they will only take combined results from 2 years,btohqsg
Means if you got 2023 2024 and 2025  then bopes you gotta 3C2,btohqsg
yeah so if i do again next year 2025 that means i can only combine 2024 and 2025?,btohqsg
You can choose which years you want to combine (or the system chooses the best for you i dont really know how it works),btohqsg
So it could be 2023 and 2025 if you choose to,btohqsg
WAIT SO IF I RETAKE FOR 4 years and i can choose which 2 years marks i get the best to use for admission?,btohqsg
Yeah if i understood it correctly,btohqsg
what course r u planning to go in poly,btohqsg
If you consider the 4 years of time used  im not sure how lenient is that lmao,btohqsg
You could literally do jc 2 times over if you spend 4 years doing o levels,btohqsg
As for the NS part  that would is a toughie. I dont think they accept private candidate as a valid reason to defer? (Correct me if im wrong),btohqsg
Then bopes just enroll into some course you know you can get into then study for your Os,btohqsg
At least give them a reason to defer you,btohqsg
As long as before university they will grant you deferment,btohqsg
if can hit minimum requirement & considering ur maths is a2 fr 2023 o’s  can apply for dae / jae next year,btohqsg
any thoughts on which poly to avoid or strive to join? Currently thinking of avoiding alll RP courses bc of the bad schedule and reviews.,btohqsg
I dont really think it matters though,btohqsg
At the end of the day its not about which poly you graduated from,btohqsg
Its what gpa you graduated with,btohqsg
i’m in np… honestly i think all poly have both bad and good students. i heard rp have graded reflective journal everyday and hard to get good gpa,btohqsg
Like you can go to NP or SP and boast about the prestige of your poly,btohqsg
But if you graduate with 2.0 aint no uni gonna want you,btohqsg
np and sp also have slackers,btohqsg
Id say the course you get into is the most important,btohqsg
for me i want to be in the healthcare. missed a few pnts to get into biomed so ended up choosing nsg,btohqsg
most importantly is choosing the course based on interest and passion,btohqsg
i see i've done alot of research on reviews from google maps about the school and vlogs and normally RP has a different schedule where there is alot of bad people and harder to get good gpa and journals and negative comments plus their cutoff point is very high so i feel like i would regret it if i joined RP and make no friends and not like it as compared to others school which fits a more introverted study routine.,btohqsg
and their semester always changes people and alot of reddit say they have fake friends there as nobody makes effort to make friends in RP anymore,btohqsg
I mean if you really feel that strongly against RP  then dont even consider it anymore. Just pretend theres only 4 polys left in sg to consider,btohqsg
Anyone can have their own opinion  it dont make it wrong,btohqsg
Can correct my opinions im ranting based on what i saw and would love exposure from personal experiences,btohqsg
whats a good course in general?,btohqsg
Theres always two sides of the coin la  for every 'bad' student in rp theres always a model student telling you otherwise  theres no end to it,btohqsg
If youre asking me that  its a little concerning dont you think,btohqsg
business  arts  technology health  humanities  sports  sciences or smt else,btohqsg
Shouldnt you go with your interest instead of whats a good course in general,btohqsg
there’s one classmate who scored 12 pnts for o lvl but her gpa ended up 1.7 in sem 1 bcs she dh the interest fr it. she can’t change course cos she eae-ed to course,btohqsg
And if you dont know what course you wanna do  im just throwing that jc is an option,btohqsg
Im leaning more towards to a course that would pay well and be more relaxed however im unsure of what to aim for as i have been mindlessly grinding my subjects for o levels,btohqsg
Feels shallow but you know you do you,btohqsg
jc is good option but academic rigour is quite high,btohqsg
My main concern was whether or not i should retake O's next year for 3rd time as im aware of changing syllabus and upcoming NS at 18. Nobody to reach out to and im greatful to have feedback from you guys.,btohqsg
nope your maths is a2 and it’s quite good,btohqsg
unless u plan to enter biomed / psych / pharmaceutical sci,btohqsg
I've definately thought about JC but my academics only allow for around 18 score which isnt low.,btohqsg
Any course works as long as there is a good career path for the diploma and (hopefully) a good experience with people there as that would forge interest into the subject,btohqsg
Can you not choose to take the old syllabus as a private candidate?,btohqsg
hey you can dm me anytime u hv doubts and i try my best to answer your qns since poly is starting next mon.,btohqsg
Idk but i thought theres always an option  its not an immediate change  no?,btohqsg
I can confirm this is a no from my old teachers who told me numerous times,btohqsg
its getting late I'll let the question marinate and pray more insight is given tmr,btohqsg
Rp as the backup plan if you drop out of np or sp,btohqsg
I thought it’s like every 2 weeks now,btohqsg
Hi! I am a rp student who just finished y1 sem1. Looks like u do feel strongly against RP- but I don't think it is really that bad 😭. Introverts still can stick to their own study routine and the journal part is more lenient now. There are more good people than bad people but it depends on who u interact with really. And I just hope u put rp as ur last option just in case,btohqsg
this is for a project u guys can vote if uw,btohqsg
Hi I’m a y3 student about to start my final sem in rpRp is the school for connections  they cycle your classes every sem to the point  80% of your old classmates won’t follow you through 2 sems.It’s harder to mantain gpa because there is a bellcurve to certain mods. The weekly grading system means you also have to be consistent throughout your semester  the quizes you may have to do every few weeks weighs heavily. Finally dependent on mod  you will either have a project or a independent exam at the middle of semester or end of semester. Usually projects will yield higher results compared to examsDaily journals will turn from daily to weekly and to a few each month for each mod as you progress through the years.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing! How would you rate life in rp as compared to secondary school life or other polytechnics?,btohqsg
It’s a really good poly to form connections  you will meet people from all different backgrounds  people from far away lands  poly dropouts form other places. They all will also have differing views on education but the key thing most want to leave rp with is a good few years of their life etc. never personally been through other poly systems so I can’t really comment on that but my neighbourhood secondary school experience is nowhere near my poly experince.In terms of what I’ve learnt  what I’ve made and how much I feel like I did. Poly life in rp is as “own time  own target” as it gets,btohqsg
can consider MI. if you live in east  consider TP otherwise NP  NYP  RP,btohqsg
every school is a good school,btohqsg
but some schools are good-er than others,btohqsg
When I see MI suddenly Lestin  Irwen and rumchel pops into view,btohqsg
I just get summoned for no reason when those 3 appear,btohqsg

Lol if I say YI how uh,btohqsg
Is it better to enroll in yishun jc or poly if i get 17?,btohqsg
Cause cutoff point can make it,btohqsg
Yishun Innova jc is actually worse than MI,btohqsg
Honestly I would say it depends uh,btohqsg
If you are unsure which courses to go to  I would recommend jc more than poly,btohqsg
those YI students got nothing better to do post bad reviews about MI,btohqsg
Or like if let say you interested in like a theoretical degree kind  or like if you interested in like law or medicine kind  jc would be ok (not saying poly is not ok but in terms of like academic requirements  jc would be slightly easier),btohqsg
But then if you are definite about jc  you really need to study hard for this one,btohqsg
What if i accidentally ate 4 tablets of panadol instead of 2,btohqsg
Oh yea but just saying uh  if you definitely sure you want to enter a certain industry like computer sci  business  engineering etc  and wanna learn something more applied  poly is more suited,btohqsg
Esp since is more geared to working life rather than university  though  you can also enter uni via poly route,btohqsg
Poly harder to enter Uni if the uni course is like 90RP or smth just go JC,btohqsg
Although 90RP and YI is like that 1 guy the myth the legend,btohqsg
I think quite hard to get 90 uh  mostly cus of PW and GP.,btohqsg
But now they change so who knows,btohqsg
4.0 harder and is like legit impossible imo for competitive courses in Poly,btohqsg
If your final goal is Uni just go JC and take the gamble and pain,btohqsg
Then go Private Uni or cry lor,btohqsg
go a&e if u feel like u r gonna die ig,btohqsg
I forget what happens.Could you take another 2 and let me know?,btohqsg
Lai come i can write a GP essay on MI already. It is the worst school in singapore currently thanks to the changes in a level grading system,btohqsg
Year 2  that focuses only on H1s is literally useless now,btohqsg
everything from teaching to resources is extremely subpar,btohqsg
only redeeming factor is teachers and even that can be hit or miss,btohqsg
i wanna apply for driving license,btohqsg
bbdc? ssdc? or js go private?,btohqsg
i mean can is can ah,btohqsg

same for YIJC maybe even worse,btohqsg
YIJC even worse teachers definitely miss,btohqsg
so YI only wins on the change to a level grading system,btohqsg
Feel like teachers is hard to absolutely confirm thk,btohqsg
time to study for O Level 😉,btohqsg
which is why the way to go is YI  then just self study,btohqsg
in the age of chatgpt you really can learn almost everything on your own,btohqsg
though if you cannot self study best advice to give people who cannot go anywhere else is to just retake,btohqsg
sure can at least make it to jp/tm,btohqsg
yi still bigger school and students have some semblance of a brain so still better culture,btohqsg
then no need to go YI just take the exam as private candidate,btohqsg
school still will give some sort of support,btohqsg
I feel school is more useful to help you feel less alone when studying,btohqsg
simply because it's a bigger school I think it's alot easier to find someone you can connect with,btohqsg
MI 2/3 of people who enter in y1 will leave before graduation,btohqsg
if being bullied principal and teacher do not care,btohqsg
but that's such a small part of school experience still,btohqsg
the thing about retaking o levels is you can take the papers individually unlike a levels,btohqsg
just that idk if 16 year olds will have the self discipline to study,btohqsg
significantly easier since don't have to juggle so many subjects,btohqsg
India driving test is just start engine and drive few meter only,btohqsg
there was a treasure hunt one 2 yrs ago in rp as well  it was found in rp at the spiral staircase i think,btohqsg
Is this the first clue? Wahaha good luck to all!!,btohqsg
nah that was where a coin was found 2 yrs ago,btohqsg
But media says do not go to private if you want high pay jobs,btohqsg
I no catch ball what the fuck u tryna say,btohqsg
so the only option is cry,btohqsg
MI got bad review  YI aso got bad review,btohqsg
You mean the whole y2 you only studying your h1 meh...,btohqsg
wherever u go and wtv u do is fully up to you,btohqsg
u follow the bad review ok lor u get a bad exp then u cry wolf,btohqsg
The entire premise of MI is that you get 3 years to do your A levels as a whole,btohqsg
when in fact many ppl go in and do decently to get into a decent course,btohqsg
Not just y2 h1 then y3 focus on h2,btohqsg
Ok not sure why im getting a tiny triggered even though my mi experience was subpar but i feel like thats just misrepresenting MI as a whole,btohqsg
Bro thinks MI bad review means no one gets into uni,btohqsg
I guess rachel you and me can just pack up and leave,btohqsg
those bad reviews about MI mostly from YI students that got nothing better to do,btohqsg
Both also got bad reviews then what you gonna do,btohqsg
Right? Then why so concerned about MI got bad reviews or YI got bad reviews,btohqsg
You go hci or rjc you dont study also 0 rp,btohqsg
those bad reviews dosen't mean anything,btohqsg

I'm telling you that the way the school has structured it basically makes your first year pointless,btohqsg
you are better off retaking o levels and going to a jc,btohqsg
"the ""many people"" are people who had tuition  or took commerce stream",btohqsg
I can tell you for sure that anybody who did well in the science stream got external help,btohqsg
I can tell u for a fact that most of the ppl who are in uni now from my batch didn't get tuition,btohqsg
majority of the top scorers every year are from commerce,btohqsg
I would rlly say it is a matter of choice,btohqsg
I'm saying that this really is a better alternative,btohqsg
so many in mi just waste their time there,btohqsg
I mean if that's what you believe then go ahead...,btohqsg
personally I haven't seen a single person retake o levels and do btr,btohqsg
maybe mi just wasn't suited for me because I was still eligible for yi,btohqsg
okay so you didn't go to MI,btohqsg
but the reason why I didn't go to YI was because of the stigma there. I put MI as my choices because I didn't hear anything bad about it from anyone,btohqsg
so what rights do you have to talk about the structure of a school that you didn't go to?,btohqsg
when in fact MI isn't really any better,btohqsg
I went to MI. and I almost died because of it,btohqsg
my school experience was that horrible,btohqsg
if your MI experience was horrible I doubt you'd have a much better experience in any other JC,btohqsg
they teach more then the bare minimum  lessons wouldn't have been so slow,btohqsg
But like i dont think the proportions would be any diff from MI tbh,btohqsg
so you're saying a two year programme is better for u,btohqsg
ok good for you? got a lot of two year programmes for u to choose from,btohqsg
there is a big difference between scoring above 20 and below 20,btohqsg
I'm sure there has to be a difference,btohqsg
but end up MI results still better than YI,btohqsg
but I think that's going to change soon,btohqsg
I mean of course I did enjoy my time in YI  but not all of them enjoy YI,btohqsg
does it matter? results are results,btohqsg
the problem is that even though my score isn't that bad I still cannot go anywhere,btohqsg
if you get 14 you just miss TM and jp,btohqsg
so where do these people go,btohqsg
let me be an open book to you,btohqsg
I took O levels  my L1R4 is 27,btohqsg
that's kind of what I wanted to say,btohqsg
I was lucky enough to be able to go MI,btohqsg
MI is more suited for people like you,btohqsg
not for people who went there as an alternative to yi,btohqsg
well if ppl like u are gna keep complaining about the lack of options then I'm sorry nowhere is going to work out for u,btohqsg
which is why I'm trying to say that yi would have been the better choice for me but everyone around me kept telling me not to go there,btohqsg
im not complaining I'm just frustrated that I made the wrong choice,btohqsg
can alw drop out and go YI,btohqsg
my friend dropped out and went to JPJC,btohqsg
worst two years of her life,btohqsg
Actually tbh  is rlly a matter of what you choose to do,btohqsg
I don't think  I know  because ppl around me have done it,btohqsg
You can choose to do basically nothing in y1,btohqsg
dropped out of MI  went to JC and Poly,btohqsg
some have done well  some have regretted,btohqsg
Or you can choose to study hard or like do other stuff like focus on ccas or even do volunterting,btohqsg
I'm not pulling shit out my ass I'm speaking from experience,btohqsg
bro you think I didn't try,btohqsg
I am also speaking from experience.,btohqsg
and I'm saying that I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake as me,btohqsg
Being in MI/YI/whatever JC is not the mistake,btohqsg
being in the wrong school is,btohqsg
being somewhere where you don't fit in is,btohqsg
so why didn't u drop out and go YI,btohqsg
there are two sides to every school,btohqsg
since u say it's not that easy,btohqsg
my year 1 experience wasn't bad,btohqsg
because I pretty much got brainwashed,btohqsg
I did well for the exams but they really weren't that hard,btohqsg
even if I dropped out it would still have been 3 years so I just continued,btohqsg
but it only started going downhill from year 2,btohqsg
everyone in my friend group didn't study and just left the school,btohqsg
so I felt that I was doing okay when actually I wasn't studying that hard,btohqsg
this one I cannot help you LOL,btohqsg
the school said that the friends you make in mi make or break your experience there,btohqsg
I just happened to be unlucky enough to find the wrong group,btohqsg
What makes you think some ppl in YI dont do this?,btohqsg
I feel that there's a larger group of people in YI that did okay for o levels,btohqsg
id find people with similar o Lvl score as me,btohqsg
there's also alot who choose yi because it's closer to their house,btohqsg
I'm not saying it's impossible to have a good time in MI or do well,btohqsg
I'm just trying to say MI isn't really a well known school  and alot of people really don't know anything about it's dark side before entering mi,btohqsg
so id like to make it more well known,btohqsg
doesn't mean they'll do okay for A levels?,btohqsg
again if you're talking about grades,btohqsg
the cold hard truth is that MI's grades are btr,btohqsg
u have your exp in MI,btohqsg
I'm p sure ppl have similarly bad exp in YI,btohqsg
I'm p sure a majority of people don't go into MI with rosy tinted glasses. they know the stigma  they've read reviews  and many of them do what they can do have a good experience or just study and get out w a decent A level cert,btohqsg
the cold hard truth for me is that as I'm preparing for a levels right now  I'm not using any of MIs resources and am self learning alot of topics,btohqsg
honestly why do you think other schools are better?,btohqsg
i have a feeling that because you hate mi  you imagine that every other jc HAS to be better  even yi,btohqsg
but that may not be the reality for students in those jcs,btohqsg
because I find JC resources more suitable for me,btohqsg
or people that I know in jc,btohqsg
i think what’s happening here is that every school’s notes have some gaps and flaws,btohqsg
lets say  you start off by using mi notes but dont understand the concept fully,btohqsg
then you try using another sch’s notes and they manage to fill in those gaps  which makes you think that sch notes are ‘better’,btohqsg
but lets say you used the other schs notes first. how do you know that sch notes doesnt have gaps of its own?,btohqsg
I simply cannot understand why you would think like that,btohqsg
Your assumption here is that everyone learns at the same pace as you do,btohqsg
Therefore jc good  mi bad. Mi 3 year waste of time,btohqsg
ok I should rephrase my words,btohqsg
Idk i just feel like you have a lot of prejudice that is clouding your fair judgement of MI,btohqsg
And thats your own experience and opinion  i respect that,btohqsg
But it doesnt mean itll be bad for everyone else,btohqsg
there really is a big difference between mi notes and JC notes,btohqsg
because mi tries to cater it to mi students,btohqsg
and yes  it may be enough to get 70rp,btohqsg
but not everyone is content with 70rp,btohqsg
Isnt that literally the point about learning,btohqsg
In MI if the notes aren't enough  then go look for other resources to supplement your learning,btohqsg
You cant expect the notes to have every single thing,btohqsg
They are training you for university too,btohqsg
it's not exactly easy to obtain external resources without paying,btohqsg
My lecture slides in university are condensed to hell and i have to pick up the textbooks to read and understand to supplement my learning,btohqsg
ok sure notes can find elsewhere,btohqsg
it's not something you can get on your own,btohqsg
In YI  the study environment also not good ah,btohqsg
tbh study environment why u cannot get your own,btohqsg
I dun study w my MI friends because they're not study vibes friends,btohqsg
I study w my other JC friends,btohqsg
Teaching  - if your teacher cant explain it good to you  find another. And then another. And another. They are all paid their fair wage to provide an education for you,btohqsg
in fact your parents are paying their salaries,btohqsg
Like tbh right I actually want to go nus instead of ntu.,btohqsg
But my rank points was cut short,btohqsg
you can't ask another teacher to teach you during lesson time,btohqsg
You just have to make the best of it,btohqsg
that doesn't mean you can't feel upset,btohqsg
Have to make the best use of it,btohqsg
Then find another teacher outside of teaching time to go through with you...,btohqsg
HAHA I rmb stoning during Econs cause my teacher cmi,btohqsg
sorry to all my Econs teachers in class,btohqsg
Dude my econs teacher also was fking cmi,btohqsg
Its not like i gave up econs and did nothing,btohqsg
you can't deny that jc would have better subject departments,btohqsg
Just go bug other teachers for consult,btohqsg
MI Econs dept like cmi la imo LOL,btohqsg
what if whole school don't have,btohqsg
Oh you dont wanna know abt YI econs also man,btohqsg
I can say for a fact that MI maths dept damn fucking strong,btohqsg
I didnt know answers can be short until i saw asrjc paper lmao,btohqsg
Then are we sure the problem is the teachers,btohqsg
this one I cannot deny but,btohqsg
teaching pace was too slow for me,btohqsg
the best econs answers I've seen r all so short wtf,btohqsg
I mean even if the teachers are shit,btohqsg
At least they are willing to teach you,btohqsg
At least they are there to teach you,btohqsg
willing to teach won't matter if your results are bad,btohqsg
it's still a fact that most science students in mi do not make it to mi,btohqsg
I'm not saying it's impossible to do well in mi,btohqsg
yes if you really want to you can,btohqsg
I'm saying that my experience there was bad and I feel upset about it,btohqsg
Ok i gtg for lecture soon but i just want to end it with a final remarkIt is ok for you to have a faster learning pace and your own opinion about the school. But as a former alumni  i just find it sad that youre shitting on the whole school just because you find the system not suitable for you.Ok peace out,btohqsg
to add on  you having a shit experience doesn't mean the school is shit. talk about your own experience  not about the school and how you MIGHT have had a btr experience elsewhere because of smth you heard,btohqsg
your parents are paying your teachers in school  the teachers are trying their best  don't blame them if you can't make use of the resources given to you,btohqsg
I am not blaming the teachers,btohqsg
there's higher powers that run the school,btohqsg
irdk what to say to you alr,btohqsg
we've all listened to your situation,btohqsg
and we've tried to help u see a different perspective,btohqsg
but you insist on blaming the school for some reason  then so be it man,btohqsg
my company not gna pay for me to yap on telegram,btohqsg
I have classmates who feel the same way as me,btohqsg
And I have MI friends who feel differently :),btohqsg
the real question is why lower tier schools in singapore have such a different schooling experience compared to others,btohqsg
unironically because of ppl like you,btohqsg
all of the problems is not limited to yi and mi,btohqsg
its seen in sec school also,btohqsg
it is not just my perspective,btohqsg
you cannot deny that someone in ri vs mi will have very different school experiences,btohqsg
because y'all have different mindsets my dear friend,btohqsg
objectively speaking  activities and opportunities presented will be different,btohqsg
Fak why ntu dont have MIT quality education,btohqsg
someone in RI wld use all the available resources available to them  and seek out more where needed  and adapt to their environment and seek out the opportunities they want,btohqsg
someone like you in MI will yap and whine about wtv you've been yapping and whining about,btohqsg
Actually maybe we shld blame ntu organisation sia,btohqsg
someone in RI would've been doing up their resume  volunteering  going for competitions  etcetc,btohqsg
ya because someone from MI and someone from RI is not the same,btohqsg
are you denying that inequality exists?,btohqsg
So far no monkeys seen often,btohqsg
inequality exists  it's how u deal with it,btohqsg
ohno inequality exists guess I'll languish and die?,btohqsg
fuck man  you're alr in wtv situation you're in  fight for your own education and your own life,btohqsg
I'm saying that more things can be done to make education more equal for all,btohqsg
His tldr is inequality exists. But the way you deal with it can change. You mean in MI you cant go for competitions or volunteering or resume building?,btohqsg
All those only exist in RI?,btohqsg
that's never going to happen  inequality will always exist,btohqsg
also aren’t ri notes available online,btohqsg
So i guess pritam singh's opportunity came out of thin air,btohqsg
Boy was NA stream and then jpjc,btohqsg
you live in an unequal world. wake up to reality or get left behind,btohqsg
He did not have opportunities given to him because he worked hard,btohqsg
there's gna be organisations like holy grail and sgexams that will alw be here to help to close than inequality gap,btohqsg
but what you make of the opportunities out thr is up to u,btohqsg
don't expect to be handed stuff on a silver platter,btohqsg
take charge of your own life,btohqsg
and if u can do that,btohqsg
u can prove to all of us here in 5 or 10 years,btohqsg
that all of us are talking shit,btohqsg
but if you can't do that  if you can't be successful on your own terms,btohqsg
then it just proves a point,btohqsg
bro talks as if I didn't spend the past 3 years doing everything I fucking can to do well for a levels,btohqsg
If thats what you took away from this conversation,btohqsg
I think its best we all stop here,btohqsg
life is unfair. suck it up.,btohqsg
you’ll have a lot more to complain about in the future,btohqsg
Today is a great day to sleep in qm lecture,btohqsg
you can come find me at hometeam later,btohqsg

idk how long i’ll be there today,btohqsg
I like how wyatt is actually paying attention in lecture like a proper student,btohqsg
While my ipad is on a game,btohqsg
i only know you’re a cookie run addict,btohqsg
I had a strict no game policy on my ipad until i discovered cookie run kingdom,btohqsg
Its like cookie run with rpg,btohqsg
Oh he finally broke his attention,btohqsg
I dont understand anything this dude been talkin since 1030,btohqsg
speaking of  i did the quiz practice then sent it into your cohort grp btw if you didn’t see,btohqsg
Much appreciated for inflating the bell curve,btohqsg
tbh i’m just trying to help some of yall over the finish line,btohqsg
Because this qm2 thing is actually killing me,btohqsg
Atp i dont even care what grade i get,btohqsg
4 mid terms and i failed all 4,btohqsg
i failed my y3 mods wheeeee,btohqsg
after i get back from my conference ill grind qm2 with you,btohqsg
i’m not sure why it’s only on this specific telegram channel where i keep getting into arguments,btohqsg
i didn’t have the same issue in sge discord,btohqsg
i’m not trying to argue. i’m just saying it as is,btohqsg
you’re free to have your own pov,btohqsg
So you just want people to agree with you? Alright MI sucks ig its true,btohqsg
RP sucks that's like a fact,btohqsg
where is caleb soh when u need him,btohqsg
But like what u gain from that fact is a separate issue,btohqsg
no i just want to be understood,btohqsg
right now i feel like i’m the only person who has a horrible experience in mi despite everyone else attending the same classes as me and having the same schedules,btohqsg
Nobody is denying your experience. But from what you are talking about  is that youre expecting more from MI than it already is. Its like i go to ITE expecting a MIT education. That's just not how it is. Its unfair. Its injustice. But thats just how the way it is,btohqsg
But it doesnt mean that MI is shit. Its just not what youre expecting. Its fine.,btohqsg
You know it's just like how I was not expecting amusical for the new Joker Movie,btohqsg
Why bother being unhappy about things outside your control when you can just get the As cert and then gtfo,btohqsg
Fak i was gonna watch it,btohqsg
your experience is always valid but you can form a ton of different conclusions from the same experience,btohqsg
Why put Lady Gaga if u aren't gonna make her sing like gaga,btohqsg
I WANT YOUR LOVE I WANT YOUR REVENGE,btohqsg
look  your experiences is valid  and I've had friend who have had horrible experiences in MI too.at the same time  I want to hear your experience  not about how the management is shit and other schools will be btr. nobody here can change management  yapping about that's not gna change anything.,btohqsg
YOU AND ME COULDVE A BAD ROMANCEEE,btohqsg
"I stand here waiting for you to bang the gongTo crash the critic saying  ""Is it right or is it wrong?""If only fame had an I.V  baby could I bear?Being away from you  I found the vein  put it in hereI live for the applause  applause  applauseI live for the applause-plause  live for the applause-plause  live for the-Way that you cheer and scream for meThe applause  applause  applause",btohqsg
ngl it’s like how people always shit on ntu management (for valid reasons) but then you go any country any uni,btohqsg
they always got their own issues,btohqsg
bc the only perspective they have is their own uni,btohqsg
cough sim uol where the hell is my course videos,btohqsg
I mean u can shit on NTU management but like if u don't have a plan then it's just pissing into the wind,btohqsg
(i say it as if its not a remod and i can go into my past mods i took to watch lmaos),btohqsg
my friend is in TUM for masters now and she was bewildered at how germany handles some of their admin side,btohqsg
i guess blaming isn’t the answer,btohqsg
It is. U just gotta know who to blame sometimes it's yourself,btohqsg
Like we get your frustration  really. But blaming wont change anything  might as well channel that energy somewhere else to make a change,btohqsg
I have been wonderingwho is the joker in the new movie but when the screen turn to black and I see my reflection I realised the true joker is me for paying money to see this shit,btohqsg
that's why I'm still in this chat tbh,btohqsg
i’m just here to occasionally drop one liners to ppl that deserve it,btohqsg
blaming myself isn’t going to get me anywhere either,btohqsg
well if blaming yourself -> motivation to work on it,btohqsg
It will get you to wake up your fucking idea and do your work,btohqsg
but excessive self loathing is bad,btohqsg
but if there’s nobody to blame then how do i justify my experience,btohqsg
He said it during yesterday lecture,btohqsg
U willingly and knowingly PUT MI in your JAE form rite?,btohqsg
It's the right time to learn actions have consequences,btohqsg
I mean its less of that and more of just learning to adapt to the circumstances,btohqsg
Nobody wouldve known MI is ass during their JAE,btohqsg
That's like the point of choosing. No one knows it it's the same issue when choosing Uni or later one in work too,btohqsg
How about you choose me instead,btohqsg
All that talk but you aint been into my room at night >:(,btohqsg
I would but I chose Si Yan and unfortunately he's still rejecting me,btohqsg
no matter how much you hear from others you will never truly know how your experience will go unless you experience it,btohqsg
So I am sticking to my choices rn bro even if I get no reciprocal love :(,btohqsg
so in this case there really isn’t anyone to blame,btohqsg
it’s more of it is what it is when it comes to things you can’t do anything about,btohqsg
from the way it sounds  its more that mi wasnt suitable for her. mi’s teaching pedagogy is optimised for a certain group of students and she didnt fall in that group,btohqsg
tldr i went to mi with the assumption that my experience there would be better than yi but ended up being disappointed because mi wasn’t suited for me,btohqsg
Hi is it better to take a course in food and beverage at nyp or hotel and leisure management at np?,btohqsg
