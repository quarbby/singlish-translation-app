eng 4math 1chi 1sci 3humans 2poa 1,btohqsg
I wanted everything A1 then literature B3,btohqsg
All the best to your A-math tmr!,btohqsg
But at the rate things are going,btohqsg
Thanks I'm hoping to not get a U,btohqsg
My school L1R5 13 enough to get onto the podium already,btohqsg
we can only judge calibre if the student maintains a constant range of grades for the same subject,btohqsg
I thought you were aiming for raw 6? It was in your profile previously,btohqsg
and whether his/her result improves further or remains stagnant or not,btohqsg
so eg if someone is borderline A1 for pure chem for common test and Mid year  thats not A1 Calibre,btohqsg
my sch 4 distinctions w a pass in eng cn go podium alr,btohqsg
U still can do it hopefully lol,btohqsg
if someone gets A1 for pure chem common test  and gets an even higher score for mid year  that's a potential A1 calibre,btohqsg
aiya no need 6 raw for DHS also,btohqsg
but i planning aim 12 pts den minus 1 cca points and go via CLEP to dhs so minus 2 more points,btohqsg
This year cop probably rise lol,btohqsg
What can u contribute to hc to make them accept u?,btohqsg
Just try ur best no need think,btohqsg
You know whatâ€™s so sad about my school,btohqsg
uk need pay every mth rite,btohqsg
People that get D7 for English,btohqsg
Can go onto The podium already,btohqsg
Haizz give up on the JC dream,btohqsg
like eg student A fluctuates between B3 and A1 non stop for a year for 4 diff exams,btohqsg
Lol...I said heâ€™s caliber for A1.. but the prelim he didnâ€™t do that well..,btohqsg
like ri and hci and nyjc,btohqsg
But still go onto the podium,btohqsg
easiest qn to ask him is whether he finds TYS easy  and his avg score,btohqsg
thatâ€™s why my school is so pathetic,btohqsg
"my sch is ""4distinctions w  a pass in eng""",btohqsg
You teach a math or POA?,btohqsg
My school itâ€™s just exceptionally well,btohqsg
this is obvs eng pass la so,btohqsg
So NA that donâ€™t get a single A also can,btohqsg
'All schools are good schools' ðŸ˜ƒ,btohqsg
now see whether student is very careful or careless in exams,btohqsg
Like for real have Sec 5s getting L1R5 of 19,btohqsg
u rarely see sec 5 gettin l1r5 lower than 20,btohqsg
Every school cohort have 1 or 2,btohqsg
If they actually study itâ€™s not difficult,btohqsg
Ah shit next year probably need to wait for 30 minutes before getting the results. The tension is gonna kill me,btohqsg
nah is not easy for them also even if they study,btohqsg
Oh yea Christian school rite? Need to pray first,btohqsg
i dont need to know that... but ok,btohqsg
I am alrdy genetically predisposed to not scoring,btohqsg
bro my parents stopped at sec sch,btohqsg
