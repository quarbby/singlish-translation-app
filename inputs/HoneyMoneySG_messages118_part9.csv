Changes to previous HSBC EGA Bonus Cashback promo:1. Reverted back from half-monthly to monthly2. Increase max cap from $2m to $3m (doesn't matter since HSBC Everyday+ Rewards caps bonus interest at $300  max $360k)3. Conflicting info of increment ADB in Jul and Aug but bonus interest earning period is only in Jul. Does it mean need to keep the incremental ADB in Jul and Aug  just to get 1 month of bonus interest?4. Any funds withdrawn within last 30 days will not count as fresh funds (i.e. entire month of Jun) - same as UOB earmark promoMust really reconsider to participate if you transferred funds out on 1 Jun.,btohqsg
