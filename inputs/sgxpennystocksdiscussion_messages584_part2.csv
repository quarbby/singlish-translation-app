Ya. Damn sian. accrelist took some at 70 and picked more at 65  ran up to 85 so quick and didn't TP  end up dropped until the pits at 55 kena f/s.

Evergrande Declared in Default as Massive Restructuring Looms1. China Evergrande Group has officially been labeled a defaulter for the first time  the latest milestone in months-long financial drama that paves the way for a massive restructuring of the world’s most indebted developer.2. Fitch Ratings cut the developer to restricted default over its failure to meet two coupon payments after a grace period expired on Monday  according to a statement. The credit assessor said the developer didn’t respond to request for confirmation on the payment  and is assuming it wasn’t made. The downgrade may trigger cross defaults on Evergrande’s $19.2 billion of dollar debt.3. The development marks the beginning of the end for the sprawling real estate empire started 25 years ago by founder Hui Ka Yan  setting off a lengthy battle over who gets paid from what remains. It also poses a challenge to the Chinese government’s efforts to prevent a debt crisis in the property sector from sparking broader contagion. Authorities have scored some successes  with markets taking the most recent developer debt stumbles in their stride after a reserve-ratio cut announced by the central bank on Monday.More here,btohqsg

💡Pika World In-Focus🔦In the world of electric vehicles  the chase on autonomous driving technology and battery technology are two key elements to become a global leader. In this episode  let’s talk about a new baby battery company in the market.🎙Decarbonisation Plus Acquisition Corp III (DCRC)🛡The company is a direct competitor to QuantumScape. The newly formed solid-state electric vehicle battery technology company is expected to gain hype as the merger of a SPAC format is approved  which will value the company at more than $500 million in fresh capital.The symbol is expected to change to SLDP in tonight trading hours. It is yet another counter for exposure to the EV battery technology company for new investors. Solid Power is backed by Ford and BMW.👍What’s so great about solid-state battery🚘In a typical lithium-ion battery  the facilitator is in liquid form. In the solid-state format  it aims to create such a battery without having any liquid electrolyte. In China  CATL is also investing in solid-state batteries.The benefits are enormous. Such batteries aim to lower costs and allow quicker charging capabilities with a safer and longer battery life. But  unfortunately  the market has not seen any company creating a large scale automotive nature solid-state battery. Moreover  it is challenging to develop since such battery packs tend to work under very high pressure to avoid defects from creating that could worsen battery performance. Hence  they are more difficult to develop compared to the lithium-ion version.🛹Should you be Investing?💵The company is far from the revenue-generating phase. However  it does have a lofty projection of about $1 billion in sales by 2027. Investors will therefore need to gauge the milestone and development to ensure viability for early investing mode. After all  the company is just in the pioneer stage of doing a sample to validate its technology in 2022. When such samples are proven acceptable  investors can explore how the production could scale up and increase the wider testing adoption by EV companies.As the road is less travelled  the potential rewards are juicy for early startups. For example  solid Power stock (after the SPAC merger) is valued at around $2.2 billion compared to QuantumScape  which is currently valued at around $11 billion.It is a stock that Pika World will be exploring!If you find this edition useful  do share with your friends as it helps us reach out to a wider audience.
