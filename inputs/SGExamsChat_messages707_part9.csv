is agree with him that he's shit,btohqsg

"just tell him ""ok see you in nus""",btohqsg
I think better support him and tell him to chase his dream,btohqsg
then later you see he cmg back broke af,btohqsg
shes an alumni i think she got some teaching related scholarships,btohqsg
the only reason im even friends with him is because we have similar acad goals  we are both hardworkers and very driven to our goal to go overseas uni... i feel like its better to mix with people who have higher expectations for themselves than people who have no clue about their future and just slack. but i think some of my ri/hc/vj/ny/acsi friends are actually a bit... how to say. their attitude not v good la and they're the reason people think of single pointer digit jcs as all elitists lol,btohqsg
I don't rly have friends from other jcs tbh,btohqsg
this is why top tier jcs= every man for themselves,btohqsg
most of my friends are ckws ðŸ’€,btohqsg
yah... i think even the majority of ri population couldnt care less about poly or ite students,btohqsg
