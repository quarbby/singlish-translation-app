Is Rae admitting she was the person in the screenshot kuro sent?,btohqsg
this was b4 she got found out on tele,btohqsg
I thought earlier we couldnâ€™t confirm itâ€™s her because the handle was hidden,btohqsg
Name was different too  so if it was her it was a burner account,btohqsg
But I donâ€™t get if Rae was talking about the messages sent to florals,btohqsg
Let me try to find the screenshot kuro sent,btohqsg
i mean she only said she shittalked the dc ppl,btohqsg
but we don't know if she shittalked the tele ppl like rose,btohqsg
Oh ya then before that she couldnâ€™t have found out florals tele I guess?,btohqsg
rae cld be using burner acct,btohqsg
she could have found out florals tele then dmed her,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why I said I was thinking itâ€™s possible that the person who PMed florals could be a sec sch bully who found out she went to YI,btohqsg
Yeah possibly and if yes using a burner account,btohqsg
y we dl them is another thing,btohqsg
"""lol imagine being in the worst poly in sg!!! lol!! can't make it to ejc = failures in life!!! womp womp!!!""",btohqsg
