Hi - referring to the chart  may I ask if you would consider a longer timeline (in white) or shorter timeline (in yellow) to determine the apex? Thank you for your advice.,btohqsg
i will just skip both and use the Volume at Price indicators that you have there. And then co-relate it with the daily volume.,btohqsg
Hi Sam  thanks a lot! May I ask what is the co-relation between VOP and apex? How to determine apex using VOP indicator? Sorry  newbie here,btohqsg
VOP will tell us the potential resistance/support. Longer bar  == stronger,btohqsg
looking at that chart.. it is somewhere around 0.08 -0.09 ?,btohqsg
you will need to validate it with daily volume too,btohqsg
because we can't tell if the current trend is strong/weak without daily volume,btohqsg
No budget for the more expensive webstationb,btohqsg
You can try looking at Trading view too. Got free option,btohqsg
Another version with OBV  MACD and volume. OBV shows accumulation  MACD looks 'u-turning upwards' and volume picking up. But still not sure about apex (white vs yellow). Again thanks for your advice Sam,btohqsg
did you notice the big spike up in volume near the start of 2021 ?,btohqsg
that big spike up in volume will distort OBV,btohqsg
Yes  the big green bar in early 2021,btohqsg
will be good to validate/ cross reference  with other indicators,btohqsg
In your opinion what would be the best indicator to determine the apex?,btohqsg
Pai seh  asking too many questions,btohqsg
no worries ah.. i also learning still,btohqsg
best indicator is VOP for me,btohqsg
and Apex is not a single price,btohqsg
but this is difficult in SG because .. stocks about 0.200 move in increments of 5,btohqsg
Okay thanks Sam. You have a pleasant evening,btohqsg
