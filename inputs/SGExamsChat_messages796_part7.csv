SQ368 that caught fire a few yrs back did not even receive this much american attention,btohqsg
abc news did not even catch this when it happened,btohqsg
Common things that happen in America,btohqsg
SQ368 literally flew for 2 more yrs and got decomissioned,btohqsg
I've been thinking about starting to save money n im curious how much is expected from people my age (19) to save up?,btohqsg
in total the newly commisioned Airbus A350 only served the skies for less than 3 yrs,btohqsg
It depends on if u work and if u get pocket money,btohqsg
Just save up as much as u can,btohqsg
if you save $1 a day  you will have $360+ at the end of the yearif you save $10 a day  you will have $3600+ at the end of the year,btohqsg
$0No societal expectations for students.Even for adults  you just need enough to have a roof and a full stomach.,btohqsg
Welp. As long you are not living paycheck by paycheck.,btohqsg
I'm living paycheck to paycheck ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
someone videoed the SQ incident on ig,btohqsg
apparently one of my jnrs was on the flight,btohqsg
idk in that mess how she took out her phone to video it,btohqsg
but it was after it landed in bangkok,btohqsg
im a bad example coz before i work  i wun want to spend money,btohqsg
no it is on her private ig acct,btohqsg
but damn it was that bad that oxygen mask was pulled,btohqsg
Oh could you briefly describe what you saw,btohqsg
The news said that the man died because of a heart attack,btohqsg
ðŸ™ˆ cost of living everywhere in the world right now is a wreck.,btohqsg
I amazed my peers at my age of 27 already owning homes and starting families. welp.,btohqsg
the plane analyst predicted that it is likely clear air turbulence so the pilot cannot give adv notice...and it is likely after lunch was served so people were queuing at the toilet,btohqsg
Bro I am 16 year old and idk what I am doing with my life,btohqsg
someone who i would think never wear seat belt apparently flew up and broke the bag compartment,btohqsg
it was said he had a heart condition too,btohqsg
the vids alr being shared around,btohqsg
its ok. I still clueless despite being 27. lol.,btohqsg
yes this is predicted gonna happen,btohqsg
alot of the injured look like they got spinal injuries,btohqsg
there was someone lying on the floor at the toilet area  then some passengers were in the bend position (i forgot what it was called on the plane)  and there were a lot of empty seats...it was quite in a chaos also,btohqsg
one of the critically injured cracked his head...he flew up and hit broken the bag compartment,btohqsg
London to SG is like a 14 hour flight. It's kinda common to be unfasten walking down the aisle  or standing in the aisle talking to someone in another row. lol,btohqsg
imagine how severe the turbulence must be to cause such an impact,btohqsg
this what I observed when I went to London last year.,btohqsg
yea and the problem was coz (i mean this is just a prediction) that it was clear air turbulence and hence the pilot dun hv room to give advance notice for people to get back to their seats and wear seat belts,btohqsg
could be bad luck  the door storage compartment wasn't locked well  Turbulence come  a luggage might hit a passenger's head.,btohqsg
because normally if the turbulence is caused by cloud  it can be predicted by the radar and the pilot / flight crew lead will make an announcement and the seat belt sign will be turned on,btohqsg
it was already said that he did flew up and hit broken the compartment,btohqsg
that is why that plane analyst said it is likely caused by clear air turbulence (not by cloud) so cannot be seen on radar,btohqsg
nevermind  you have a long way to go before your 30s. Just know what you want to do  instead of following other footsteps. And try not to end up as much education debt. lel.,btohqsg
not in SG but im not sure anywhere near bangkok did hv storm,btohqsg
but from the video  looks like a no?,btohqsg
i hate presentations  let alone stuff like ur group member talking to themselves behind u when u were talking,btohqsg
and the cher did nothing to intervene,btohqsg
Well I've seen an A-level senior of mine dedicated his Master Thesis to Hatsune Miku. Could be much worst.,btohqsg
i did screwd up coz it did distract me and i tot i said something wrong,btohqsg
What's the objective of the Group Project and how is the assessment criteria. lol,btohqsg
test ur ability to work in a team i guess,btohqsg
