Is it better to take private uni directly or go through poly first?,btohqsg
I'm a bare pass grad from NUS High,btohqsg
why go through poly again? takes a long time,btohqsg
My mom seems to think I'd be better off in poly then local university over just private university (mostly because of networking and clubs),btohqsg
She's not wrong  tbh... I'm also probably past the point where overseas unis might take me (except maybe Japan/USA?),btohqsg
I'm not sure how Japan sees our local private unis though,btohqsg
but it takes 10 years for you to do that,btohqsg
nothing can be said w certainty if I can read the future I wldnt be studying,btohqsg
yes so there is no certainty which is better,btohqsg
doesn't mean u can't choose the path that'll have higher probability of bringing a btr future,btohqsg
Can I make up for the lack of networking in a private university?,btohqsg
some NUS i know also cannot get a job within one year,btohqsg
i can tell u if I'm in a private uni idt I'll have the business card of one of the director of Singapore's national accountancy certification board in my phone case rn,btohqsg
lidad private uni aso cannot get job within one year,btohqsg
u need compare same degree mah,btohqsg
I'm not too into accountancy anyway  or I'd just continue with ACCA all the way,btohqsg
Also  consider the overseas aspect. Japanese immigration REALLY requires a degree  it's a hard requirement,btohqsg
what do you mean by circumstance?,btohqsg
Or 10+ years of work experience,btohqsg
why nus degree cannot get job?,btohqsg
certain industries private uni but can smoke interview is gna be btr than big 3 cannot smoke interview,btohqsg
I'm not sure about the US or Europe though,btohqsg
I know Australia offers PR to cyber security professionals,btohqsg
and ISCA is also starting an office one floor above my school,btohqsg
But a) I'm considering moving to the US because I'll probably have family there too by the time I graduate (my Viet aunt and uncle plan to send their son to the US for high school) and b) I have no real reason to move to Australia over someplace like Japan or US,btohqsg
Maybe visit a few times  but not live there,btohqsg
I still don't get your point,btohqsg
So in that case  would a local private university  poly + local public uni or overseas uni (probably in Japan) be better?,btohqsg
US uni is out of my reach,btohqsg
they still have to join ISCA exams and training i think,btohqsg
you see whr u want to relocate to lor  see how recognised private degrees aresay for eg UK  local big 2 unis will be able to get work visa more easily,btohqsg
I'm mostly looking at JPN and USA,btohqsg
Japan honestly idk cause they hate foreigners,btohqsg
USA... generally hard to go thr as a foreigner unless you got a degree thr. even then it's v hard,btohqsg
I aso have to join isca exams and training,btohqsg
Does a local private university degree issued by a US university count?,btohqsg
or at least  I don't think so,btohqsg
NTU/NUS will probably still be better recognised than a US university unless it's ivy league,btohqsg
even NUS and NTU hard to get a place there,btohqsg
