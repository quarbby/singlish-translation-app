Why not? But card usage is limited in taiwan.,btohqsg

Should be able be used.  I used my trust card for a lot places like 7-eleven  buy bus ticket  buy train ticket.However note that night markets  topping up or buying the youyou travel card still needs cash.,btohqsg
I have no issues with the rates  even round up to a difference of 10 yen exchange  I think I probably won‚Äôt lose sleep at night thinking my exchange rate is badI think it‚Äôs a matter of choice.,btohqsg
Didn't try my youtrip but trust link & cashback worked well in Taiwan.,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt mind paying some fees  Amaze + CRMC is not bad as a travel card. It‚Äôs 4mpd.Just make sure don‚Äôt pay for hotel or airfares with it.Food and other purchases it works well.,btohqsg

Hi guy  recently I have UOB one card for my recurring sp and SingTel bill and around 200 more to hit 1000 tier (will first hit this card for rebate). With Citi reward for other spending and UOB prvi for my travelling spend. I know there is lack of a travel spending card for hotel and air ticket spending and temporary not planning to get it as I may just travel once a year. Is with such card is paired well ?,btohqsg

I will buy an IWC watch worth as much as $200 000,btohqsg
Yes you can. Go to your payment bank internet banking interface and do a bill payment to SCB Card Centre or SCB then key in the 16 digits of your card number,btohqsg
You can do a $1 payment as test to make sure it works üòä,btohqsg
Noted going to do tat later,btohqsg
qn: if my credit card spend on the 29 Oct is under pending status and is only confirmed on 1 Nov  does this count as Nov's credit spending for UOB and OCBC?,btohqsg

Does Uob have a policy whereby if amount due is under $10  no repayment is needed? This didn‚Äôt appear in my statement as a payable card entry but I still paid it off just in case. Not fun to kenna late charge and minimum interest for $6.33.,btohqsg
for me  my UOB cards are under GIRO. If it's under $10  the GIRO payment won't be triggered but I won't kena late charge and interest. If you're kiasi just FAST the $6.33 to your credit card. or overpay the card and use the credit for future spend,btohqsg
yeah i just repaid the $6.33 already. Not worth the potential downsides.,btohqsg
so sad my app don't have this offer,btohqsg
so far i know of 3 tiers$900 get 5%$1000 get 4%. Fulfilment quota = 150 only?!$50 get 5%@ChrisHMSGnot sure if you want to highlight it is first xxx fulfilment only? I don't know the $900 tier quota.,btohqsg
