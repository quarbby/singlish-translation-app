Actually what happens to shareholders when they delist?,btohqsg

We do not know the full stories la.. May be political also.. Maybe they get tax cut or extra advantages.. But no matter what.. It cannot be bad,btohqsg
i am not able to answer these qn. not so savvy but in the article they only showed a initial plan on mask production. They did mentioned that post covid 19 will lead to a wane in demand and the article seem to suggest that they have some follow up plan. i am still waiting to see what they release on sustainability measures then we can determine if the venture is good or not.,btohqsg
Can try add back. Not sure why combot remove the post and remove user. Maybe some banned words or what,btohqsg
it was reported in the news though. they had a press conference,btohqsg
I’m just thinking aloud not throwing u questions.Of course if that’s the price to enter US market then might be a good move. But also likely to eat into cash flow and dividends. Longer view required again,btohqsg
yeah it okay can learn from different perspective,btohqsg
need to be thinking properly then can survive in our small market,btohqsg
