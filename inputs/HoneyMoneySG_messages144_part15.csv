Can only check for current month.Did u hit 500 spend on cc?,btohqsg
Contact uob cso then. Suspect some of ur spends didnt meet the req.,btohqsg
how can i check for current month btw?,btohqsg
Under uob one acct. click “view activities”,btohqsg
Just a reminder. When talk to CSO  shall talk carefully. Not to mention self-transfer to qualify for salary . 😆,btohqsg
"Just phrase the question to uob cso. ""I didn't receive my interest for last month. What is missing?""😁",btohqsg
Hi  crmc pair with amaze and hsbc revolution cc  which one is better for grab ride,btohqsg
Same same. And no need to pair crmc with amaze for grab ride.,btohqsg
Didn't OP just asked yesterday? haha,btohqsg
if only use crmc will also earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Grab app payment is already online  no need to link to Amaze.,btohqsg
oops ps ps missed out the msg 😅,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to reach DBS helpdesk agent? Can't seem to find that option via the phone and chatbot option. Not sure if there're other ways,btohqsg
There’s a send message option in chat bot,btohqsg

Live+ is the new shiny toy. All budgets are here instead of HSBC Revo.,btohqsg
Should extend to 31 Dec 2025,btohqsg
They can choose not to extend,btohqsg
Hahah then I will say bye bye bye to the card,btohqsg
Tap on Nov's bonus interest and you'll see what's the issue,btohqsg
Is it this one? Doesn't seem like it allows for instant live chat with an agent,btohqsg
Don't think there's instant live chat now  need to call if you want instant.,btohqsg
I couldn't find the right phone option to reach their live agent 😞,btohqsg
Any hack to meet the 800 spend ?,btohqsg
Is it wise to be a mile chaser with just average $600 monthly spend ? Plan on using CRMC amaze,btohqsg
I tried yesterday  no more live chat anymore.,btohqsg
give you some stats:$600 per month = 2 400 milesto redeem a decent ONE WAY business class ticket to Japan = 52k milesthat is 52 000 / 2 400 = 21.6 months,btohqsg
the good news is i don't expect anyone to only have consistently $600 monthly credit card spend throughout their lives,btohqsg
pay for friends when out for meals + get DBS altitude to pay for cheaper miles to hit sooner,btohqsg
Just remember to check out the exclusions before using the card,btohqsg
with the same miles  can redeem return on EVA lorh haha,btohqsg
Was using UOBone + UOBone combo now thinking whether to change to OCBC360 + CRMC amaze combo for slight higher interest (3.2%),btohqsg
Other than using CRMC to get 4x points for miles. If you have prudential policies  you can SC prudential cc card to clock points with your insurance.,btohqsg
chose purpose as 'salary payment' from the drop down list?,btohqsg
Can I kindly checkI made a transaction within the promo period.If I made a transaction before registering the passport via SMS  is the transaction counted towards bonus miles of 2.6miles per dollar?,btohqsg
If never even receive any bonus interest  the problem could be spend le  cuz it's the first criteria to meet..,btohqsg
The promo period for the UOB Foreign currency promotion is from 8 Nov to 31 Dec 2024,btohqsg
So just checking with allIf you made a transaction earlier in the promo period but only registered later  are those transactions counted towards earning the bonus miles?,btohqsg
I think for uob is from reg onward. U can check tnc,btohqsg
Yes. I did check but its not clear in tnc. Basically they said all txns are valid within the promo period and u just need to register once,btohqsg
PSA: If anyone booked Expedia using Shopback 12/12 promo between 12-2am  please URGENTLY check your tracked cashback. It is supposed to be 14.5% but all my bookings are now tracked only at 12.5%.If you are affected  I urge you to reach out to Shopback to get them to ADJUST the Tracked Cashback NOW.I contacted them of this issue and they gave some stupid excuse that they cannot investigate further until 120 days later. What nonsense.More of us contact them to make noise  the faster they will act.,btohqsg
Hello guys  if I wan to buy something on Kris shop  what is the best method to maximise the miles earned? Is it going thru Kris+?,btohqsg
