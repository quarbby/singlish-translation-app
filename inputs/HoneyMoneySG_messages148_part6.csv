For cardup transaction  it will take a few days for payment to reach so most likely won't make it in time.Amex Krisflyer can work but rewards is not worth the fee.,btohqsg
You can.. the voucher will be issued within 5 mins once you deposit the equivalent amount.. and you can transfer out after the voucher is issued,btohqsg
Thanks so much 🙏 which card would be worth please?,btohqsg
As this is a public forum  no one can advise you. You'll have to do your own research and make your own call. Good practice is to analyse your picks  diversify  DCA and review.,btohqsg
Yes. If you plan to use it.,btohqsg
Cannot. But usually no issues if late by few days. Check on CardUp FAQ to see which cards are eligible for rewards.,btohqsg
