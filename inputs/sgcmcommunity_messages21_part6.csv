sorry not available  please come back during my working hours,btohqsg
Why are we still talking about hogging.,btohqsg
haha i know very little  still learning from everybody :),btohqsg
… which starts in 18 mins time?,btohqsg
Haha 60% is foreigners driving their company's vehicles 😔,btohqsg
To me most hogger are taxi   old man   act family man  or some high ego ppl driving a slow car but act as if the king of the road,btohqsg
Most disgusting is those that act family man and said oh my god u are speeding   u are endanger me   I got kids in my car .If safety is so important why block ppl in the first place and put themself in a dangerous position,btohqsg
Personally I don't see a big deal in hogging. Just overtake and end of story. If traffic doesn't allow overtaking  then stay safe,btohqsg
They see you floor pedal they tulan you.,btohqsg
Flooring at traffic light also makes people tulan,btohqsg
Drifting at 99 bend also make people tulan,btohqsg
maybe got a even slower driver blocking him in the middle lane😂,btohqsg
Yes in certain sense but some is deliberately block you 1   u want overtake they also accelerate,btohqsg
I met too many of such,btohqsg
Ya.. So if they accelerate then should not be hogging anymore?,btohqsg
Everyone has some bad driving habits which someone else dislike. I also have many bad driving habits  just live and let go lah,btohqsg
I have overtook cars and they flashed high beams at me.I also have cars flashing high beams at me wanting me to give way when I'm driving at 120. There are always such bad drivers around,btohqsg
Some will even be aggressive and show u how good Thier driving skill or how powerful Thier car is,btohqsg
need more patience la. sg so small 30min one end to another. not like we need travel few hundred km,btohqsg
even u damn fast ... will still meet at next redlight,btohqsg
sometimes its the hoggers that make you kena that redlight when many others cross on green already,btohqsg
previously they are slower than lane 2  you want to overtake they accelerate to be parallel to lane 2. so to answer you  no they are still hogging,btohqsg
Try one week of not flooring pedals and see if others tulan you. I bet not. Things will change. Flooring pedals is not good,btohqsg
I joking nia HAah   how can always floor   small tap already car surge forward liao,btohqsg
For sure posers is bmw owners. The bmw club singapore has many. They squat down checking led lights and to see the right side level is same as the left side.,btohqsg

I bought a cartoon of engine oil just to refill,btohqsg
maybe newer one should be better,btohqsg
mini so laoya meh... so many gals driving how they tahan,btohqsg
How I know lol maybe is I turbo kick in too much ?,btohqsg
Ok this name suit me more,btohqsg
flooring induces sudden torque and stress the engine. once a while okay  but do it frequently stresses the engine,btohqsg
Oh my no wonder but it just feel too good,btohqsg
that's y it's best to floor borrowed car. not your own,btohqsg
i hardly floor my cars from stationery. but i floored it under load. and in my few hundred thousands of driving the clutch did not require to be changed. NEVER changed clutch actually,btohqsg
protect your engine. do not floor it from rest,btohqsg
instructions unclear  my car now has 6 neutral gears.,btohqsg
You did replace the pistons and rods right?,btohqsg
I felt attacked. But it is true,btohqsg
Sadly only for the US market,btohqsg
Thank you for entertaining vid sir.,btohqsg
Strangely I feel a lot of drivers drive this way in Singapore whether BMW or not,btohqsg
I was given the 1-foot treatment the other day on Lane 1 by a Hiace hahahaha. Traffic wasn’t light at that time.,btohqsg
I think I could see his mole on the left ear.,btohqsg
He should make a video “how to be a Tesla driver”1. Must floor pedal at traffic lights,btohqsg
why tesla driver floor the car?,btohqsg
To try to get to the other side faster than other cars?,btohqsg
I love Why Did The Chicken… jokes!,btohqsg
