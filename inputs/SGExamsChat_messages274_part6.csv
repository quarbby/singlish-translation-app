hi there! yes you can sign up again :) itâ€™s to update whether any additional help is required and also whether you are interested in joining a study group,btohqsg
Just let uk smth ah@jacquelyn1234if u wan dsa,btohqsg
U can only can DSA when ur in sch ah,btohqsg
Iâ€™m only private candidate for a math,btohqsg
But u sure u wanna self study a math by your self?,btohqsg
For me is not really easy tho,btohqsg
Maybe I can hire tutor after o levels,btohqsg
YesIt's not easyI was a private candidate for Math beforeIt's quite struggling,btohqsg
Can I know how much did you get so I know what to expect,btohqsg
You must have tuition and a lot of discipline.,btohqsg
How many chapters are there in a math,btohqsg
You will learn Sec 3-4 A Maths in one year,btohqsg
The syllabus have been scaled down,btohqsg
@its_shxnbut why did you become a private candidate,btohqsg
So new syllabus is easier to learn now?,btohqsg
if u saw the sample paper,btohqsg
Cos I wanna know if itâ€™s worth it,btohqsg
But they cut down of some chapter.,btohqsg
u wan to know mine or neh,btohqsg
I hope y'all don't laughðŸ˜…When I was a school candidate  I got C5 for MathWhen I was a private candidate  I got C6 for MathI did not go for any tuition because I wanted to save money (although I did not work before  but I understand that money is not easy to earn  so I didn't want to spend money on tuition)That time the only way was to ask my secondary school teacher for helpThe weakest topics that I faced were properties of circle and 3D trigonometry,btohqsg
There still some student struggle with A math,btohqsg
If you don't mind telling me  pleaseðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I'l pm mine cuz mine q long winded,btohqsg
But idk if itâ€™s really worth it to waste 1 bfore going to year to be a private candidate,btohqsg
Like Iâ€™m quite scared of the different certificates,btohqsg
But 1 year is quite rush unless you can take it.,btohqsg
Then I will start studying next year in o levels,btohqsg
Well i completed the entire NA syllabus in a uear.,btohqsg
cuz alot only take private if they want a btr score and just for a sub,btohqsg
I really start focusing for A math after Sec 3 EOY.,btohqsg
And my test is all on Sec 3 A math syllabus,btohqsg
Iâ€™m really scared on the different certificate,btohqsg
if u wan to take amath I suggest studying this year alr,btohqsg
ur new sch wont know that ur a private,btohqsg
2 years is safer than just 1.,btohqsg
But the most important is do they know Iâ€™m took a math cos h2 math needs a math,btohqsg
That time I take.. I regret cramming the whole thing in 1 year.,btohqsg
Yes. I even signed for a class,btohqsg
And my test is on end dec.,btohqsg
So i was given like 3 months to complete all the Sec 3 syllabus,btohqsg
why would u want to take it when u can go some sch for bridging math for h2,btohqsg
But Iâ€™m not sure which schools,btohqsg
I told u some but sedly u said no,btohqsg
YepNot really true2016 NA and O level Mathematics was the first batch of new syllabus (I mean to me when I was in sec 4)It was very hard for many of us during my time because of real-life applicationI'm not really sure about your syllabus (whoever is taking Mathematics now)  but I think would be also harder as well.If you find your syllabus is easier  it is either that you're super smart at Mathematics or because of cutting down number of chaptersOkay done,btohqsg
these are the schools btw:YIJC(B3 and btr )  ASRJC(emath must be A2  n btr )  JPJC (must talk to  the sch principal )and TMJC(u nid get A1) MI(c5 and btr),btohqsg
those updated as per my batch ah,btohqsg
@chemcerur sch the h2 same  condition anot,btohqsg
Ik asrjc n jp no diff,btohqsg
H2 math have also cut down the topic for 9758,btohqsg
And they have introduced real life applications.,btohqsg
