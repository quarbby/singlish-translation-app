"Singapore News!It is recommended that everyone wear a mask because the new coronavirus Omicron XBB variant is different  deadly and not easy to detect correctly: —The symptoms of novel coronavirus Omicron XBB are as follows:1. No cough.2. No fever.There will only be many:—3. Joint pain.4. I have a headache.5. Neck pain.6. Upper back pain.7. Pneumonia.8. General loss of appetite.——Of course  COVID-Omicron XBB is five times more virulent than the delta variant  and the mortality rate is also higher.The condition takes a shorter period of time to reach extreme severity  sometimes with no obvious symptoms.Let's be more careful!This type of virus does not reside in the nasopharyngeal area and directly affects the lungs in a relatively short period of time  the ""window.""- Several patients diagnosed with Covid Omicron XBB were eventually classified as having no fever and no pain  but X-ray results showed mild chest pneumonia.Nasal swab tests frequently provide negative COVID-Omicron XBB results  and cases of nasopharyngeal tests providing false negative results are increasing.-This means that the virus can spread within the community and directly infect the lungs  causing viral pneumonia and causing acute respiratory stress.This explains why the new coronavirus-Omicron XBB is highly contagious  highly virulent and lethal.─Please note that you should avoid going to crowded places  keep a distance of 1.5 meters even in open spaces  wear a double-layer mask  and use a suitable mask.  If you do not have symptoms of coughing or sneezing  wash your hands frequently.--Covid Omicron *""WAVE""* is deadlier than the first wave of COVID-19.  So we have to be very careful and take all kinds of coronavirus precautions.Also stay vigilant in communicating with your friends and family.Don't keep this information to yourself  share it with other relatives and friends as much as possible  especially your own family and friends.🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏",btohqsg
