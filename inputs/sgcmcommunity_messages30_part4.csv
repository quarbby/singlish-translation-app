no la. i aint so die hard. every brand has its own merits. after so many months here  you should know i am not a die hard of any brands. although i enjoy bmw driving dynamics  i am open to other brands. i dont defend mazda nor bmw nor alfa vehemently. i have an open mind  really.,btohqsg
"i just thought that for daily driver  mazda is a lot better than toyota and honda because it is ""complete""",btohqsg
I drove the Mazda 3 from GetGo 33k mileage. So much better than Toyota  Axio/altis,btohqsg
