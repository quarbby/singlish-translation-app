How to get free CRO using the blue card?,btohqsg
If your spend more than $1k  you need both cards because revo n Citi rewards max $1k only  to earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
No more rebate on blue card,btohqsg
Hi guys  quick question.. my company just credited my salary via giro(pic below) may I know if I qualify for salary credit interest? what's the diff between the two? thanks,btohqsg
The top one is interbank giro so like bank to bank fund transfer while the bottom one is giro salary which will qualify for the salary credit part,btohqsg
To be sure  you can check whether the ticker moves via the web portal,btohqsg
Hi HMSG experts  I have UOB savings deposit account. Could & should I change my UOB one card billing period to follow calendar month?,btohqsg
probably good for easier tracking on the $500 card spend assuming u meant the uob one account,btohqsg
Missed UOB One spend amount by a bit... Any chance if call in?,btohqsg
Yes. Can try. Usually once a year they will allow appeals easily.,btohqsg
Boss. Which is the best card to pay tax using Cardup? 😅,btohqsg
Oh really ok thanks for the tip,btohqsg
Cashback: maybank platinum visaMiles: uob privi miles,btohqsg
Whats the most cost efficient way to send money to Indonesia?,btohqsg
I noticed that no one recommends 1.5/1.6mpd cards for cardup @.@Is it cause of the barrier to entry for those cards?,btohqsg
Yes  if you are talking about citi ultima and dbs vantage,btohqsg
ic. So DBS vantage is better?,btohqsg
Existing card member means existing DBS member? So max I will get 40000 miles if I pay the annual fee and the sign up gift.,btohqsg
Nice. But with UOB privi miles I can get up to 50000 miles with min. Spent of $1000 for 2 months.,btohqsg
The UOB auto system reject my Priv Miles fee waiver request  I checked the t&c need to spend $50k sia. I called in CSO wanted to transfer to the auto system  I tell her it ask me to contact customer service  then she put on hold and after long wait then waive for me…,btohqsg
btw cardup/ipaymy excluded from the $4k spend for sign up bonus,btohqsg
Ok thanks bro. Back to UOB Card.,btohqsg
Sorry guys a bit off topic. Anyone knows what is the name of the mobile phone convention in May?,btohqsg
Does atome count towards online spend for UOB EVOL card?,btohqsg
Either online or mobile transaction  depend on how you pay it. Pls also check mcc code 5399 or 5999 is not excluded (sure be not). Refer to its T&C. Gd to do some homework & learn the skills.https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/uob-evol-terms-and-conditions.pdf?i_cid=pfs:sg:owned:int:site:na:li:na:na:na-evergreen:direct:na&vid=none,btohqsg
50k?! Thats like not maximizing ur spending for 3.25k per month,btohqsg
I have hold uob privi for very long  never ever spend 50k for all 3 (visa master amex) but got waiver always,btohqsg
Same. Nowhere close to 50k. Got waiver,btohqsg
Is it your only credit card with uob? If “solus card” meaning only cc with them  usually they will waive off,btohqsg
Morning everyone  is using amaze plus citi cashback+ a good choice for large overseas spending (above 10k)?,btohqsg
Morning everyone  I have monthly rental of $6 100 and is exploring which way is better to earn cash back via cardup or citi payall. Anyone has similar experiences to advise? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Yes sounds like a good combination to me,btohqsg
For cashback  first choice should be Amaze + SCB Manhattan.Then Amaze + Citi Cashback+.That was my combo for large spending overseas.,btohqsg
Hi ! Good Morning! I have linked my mastercard with instarem card. Who should I pay bill to? Thanks,btohqsg
I think cardup and citi payall work better for miles cards because most cashback cards offer less cashback than the processing fee. Especially for a large amount like 6.1k.,btohqsg
Thank you. I am new to credit card  and all this thing. I will go and read up. Thanks,btohqsg
Thanks. Which miles credit card and method would you recommend? I think cardup offer more options,btohqsg
Uob prvi miles is one of the better ones. You can read this article by cardup for other recommended cards to usehttps://blog.cardup.co/personal/best-air-miles-card-on-cardup/,btohqsg
Cardup also has a promo code for a discounted fee on rental payments,btohqsg
Thanks shifu for the recommendation. Didn’t know Cardup deal is so good. I have other bills to pay and hope to seek advice.Cardup PlanIncome tax: UOB PriviInsurance: ?Maintenance Fee: ?Any card to recommend for insurance and maintenance payment?Thanks in advance 🙏,btohqsg
actually why not use citi payall for all of these? 2.2mpd  2.2% fee,btohqsg
I didn’t know Citi Payall can also pay maintenance fee  etc,btohqsg
Can pay anything u want  afterall you are paying a fee.,btohqsg
just need an account number to pay to.,btohqsg
Any idea how to withdraw money from webull? Intend to cash out The Tesla stock but with I went to withdraw  the amount is not reflected..,btohqsg
Have you sold the stock? There is also settlement period (I believe T+2) before the sale proceeds can be withdrawn.,btohqsg
Already pass the lock in period? If you withdraw before the lock-in period  you are risking your rewards.,btohqsg
tx for this vid @ChrisHMSG!Q: i’m using UOB One Credit Card to top up my Grab Wallet which us linked to Shopback. not much diff w directly linking UOB acc instead of GP with SB right -  as i still gain points from GP? tx!,btohqsg
UPDATE: Annual Fees waived for UOB PPV today. Points credited back to account. No one called.,btohqsg
Just link UOB one direct to shopback,btohqsg
ok - i thought UOB one will track the same from any purchase made via GP or SB?,btohqsg
Anybody using Coinbase card in SG here? How is it compare toCrypto.comcard?,btohqsg
Would like to share my exp for SC manhattan. There was 1 yr i was charged the annual fee. Called to waive  failed. Talked to CSO and it failed. I said then i would have to cancel the card. But i had credit (cashback money) still sitting in there unused. CSO waived the fee and told me to wait 1 more mth then call in to cancel again. I never called in to cancel. I only cancelled it much later. I forgot how long i kept the card for,btohqsg
oh no.. SCB Manhattan is limited edition and one of the best cards for infrequent large expenditure.. and very good to pair with Amaze for overseas spending.,btohqsg
Need to clock 3k sgd for 3% cashback lol,btohqsg
Actually one tip I have for you all is try to get yourself onto SCB Priority Banking. Firstly  their esaver has frequent promotions which give above average interest rates. Secondly  by being on SCB Priority Banking  you get fee waiver on most items except the unwaivable credit cards. Thirdly  you get free Priority Pass by holding the SCB Priority Banking Visa Infinite.,btohqsg
Apart from my wedding and honeymoon  i dont spend so much  havent factor in the exclusions,btohqsg
yeah infrequent large expenditure. Like booking air tickets and hotels.In fact  if not for SCB Manhattan  I don't know how to pay for my air ticket and hotels bookings. The free miles card don't have enough spend quota.,btohqsg
Ocbc short charge me 0.5% interest on my 365 account. Should I go post on their Facebook page? They did not count my scoot flight spenting.,btohqsg
did you ask them why Scoot spending was not included?,btohqsg
I wait 2weeks for this response. After reply. No more response. Really knn services,btohqsg
I wonder did they pay me the 0.3% for my scoot 🤣,btohqsg
With UOB lady solitaire card  you can earn 6mpd on travel n air ticket   max $3k/month. If you value 1.5 cents per mile  that is 9% of rewards per dollar.   You may want to check if your expenses can meet the card criteria.,btohqsg
"Could it be your scoot transaction was posted in March instead?""Only retail transactions with posting date within the calendar month will be eligible. OCBC Bank is not responsible for any failure or delay in the transmission or posting of the transactions made by merchants or any other party.""",btohqsg
Have a question for sifus. If i buy phone from samsung website using their installment  does it fall under installment plan exclusions for credit cards,btohqsg
yeah we did look at this card and we arrived at about 2.7% cashback equivalent (if convert UNI$ to cashback). That is lower than manhattan 3% cashback.But the miles earn does indeed look good and it is something that my household is considering if we venture into using miles.https://milelion.com/2023/03/20/explained-which-mccs-are-included-in-the-uob-ladys-card-travel-category/,btohqsg
How did you manage to get Coinbase card?,btohqsg
I haven get yet. So not avail in SG yet?,btohqsg
I don't believe that card is available in SG,btohqsg
Hi guys  need some assistance.. I am currently in Taiwan right now and I’ve been using my Amaze + CRMC for my spending. However  ytd evening onwards I started to encounter rejected transaction even though my CRMC limit is still available. Anyone encountered the same issue?,btohqsg
We just applied. Thanks for the tip. First year is free anyway.Chose:FashionTravelWe checked no promo for existing UOB card members.,btohqsg
If you are paying MCST fees  note that only the following can be paid by citi payall,btohqsg
How do you arrived at 2.7%?,btohqsg
Usually we don’t use miles to redeem shopping vouchers as the conversion rate is not attractive.  Miles is much better if you use it to redeem air ticket.,btohqsg

Hi  I want to donate money via credit card to Overseas Charitable organisation which card is best to earn miles? Thanks,btohqsg
Physical Gift Card topups at Unity i think,btohqsg
Uob one gives 3.33% base to shopback. But gives nothing for grabpay wallet top-up,btohqsg
I didn't get mine too. Paid on 9 Feb and posted in 365 bill in Feb some more. I stopped using it for overseas travel le.,btohqsg
Hi all the Gurus  can someone share with me the best way to move USD from broker A to broker B? How to best reduce the loss of currency conversion since I need to keep in USD as well.,btohqsg
I dont have the full list. But from what i know cimb is free for incoming and outgoing USD transfershttps://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/help-support/rates-charges/fees-charges/remittance.html,btohqsg
Oic. Miles chasers usually don’t use miles to redeem shopping voucher because the conversion rate is not good.If your expenses can hit $600 per month  UOB Evol offers better cashback.Evol for online spend $380 :$250 x 8% = $20$130 x 0.3% = $0.39.Which equal to 5.36% cashback provided hit min $600 spend per month.,btohqsg
what is broker A and broker B?if they themselves have cheap FX transaction fees.. you can consider:Exchange USD into SGD in Broker A. Transfer SGD back to your SGD bank. Transfer SGD into Broker B. Exchange SGD into USD.End up  the FX transaction fees for USD/SGD (a very tight currency pair) could just be a few dollars.Caveat: you should perform the USD/SGD buy and sell at the same time to avoid FX fluctuations.,btohqsg
The main issue is transfer of USD usually results in a USD10 fee being deducted by the Correspondent Bank and there is no way to avoid this from what I know.,btohqsg
Can check Disneyland ticket direct from websites consider travel?,btohqsg
Hi all  which would you recommend doing  topping up to MA to cap first or top up to RSTU first ?,btohqsg

does CRMC paired with amaze works for shopback pay to get 4mpd?,btohqsg

Unfortunately  ocbc make the rules and they have the final decision. All u can do is try appeal,btohqsg
They will claw back the over refunded amt eventually,btohqsg
Ah ok  was thinking if to make the call again cause it frankly sounds abit troublesome for me to do it on my end,btohqsg
any bank stastement in the recent three months will do (no need to pay),btohqsg
The date shown on the statement is it transaction date or posting dates?,btohqsg
Don't think the statement is showing posting date because the app will show a posting date that is usually different from the transaction date,btohqsg
Probably that's the reason why u didn't get the 0.5%,btohqsg

Just learnt something today about the HSBC EGA. Payment of road tax via HSBC credit card not eligible for 1% cash back,btohqsg

Hi everyone  what is the best bank to open CPFIS and SRS account  any difference?,btohqsg
Minute difference  if any. If you not urgent to open srs  may want to wait towards end of year. Usually banks will offer promotion to open srs account.,btohqsg
I THINK. The difference is in the cost for CPFIS. Read somewhere that UOB is cheapest per quarter. But negligible difference la imo,btohqsg

Look out for the monthly miles-back promos and most recently upsized GAstronomy series for upsized miles with certain partners.And also 10% discount for some merchants like Gong cha when u use krisPay,btohqsg
anyone has any idea on this? its about 5% interest for first $100k so quite significant,btohqsg
Yes .but u gotta meet all the criteria,btohqsg
honestly not hard. i think 1.6k or 2k salary  and spend 500 on their credit card,btohqsg
Dont think this work  most say must giro from biz account,btohqsg
only the salary pose a problem to me  so i trying to confirm if can do via this PAYNOW SALA method,btohqsg
from their website  trying to see if anyone done it. because its weird to me that its PAYNOW SALA and not PAYNOW SALARY when the field got sufficient space to type full,btohqsg
I can confirm SingSaver is really slow. Fulfilled promotion criteria last month  still waiting. Their TnC states reward will be credited 3 to 4 months after fulfilment 😴,btohqsg
Follow Exclusion list / white list of HSBC Revo card?,btohqsg
Transaction classified as mobile or others?,btohqsg
Thanks to all the shifu here  I have decided to use UOB Priv and Cardup for my tax income payment.1. Use Endowus promo to waive first payment up to $1.5k. 0% fee2. Use Cardup income tax promo to pay for outstanding amount. 1.76% fee25200 miles earned without paying annual fee4274 miles earned from tax/miscTotal earned around $324.21 in value exclude 2nd tranche of fee.The rest of the points I can’t earned unless I pay annual fee and oversea spending for consecutive two months.,btohqsg
For Singsaver  they borderline want to cheat your gift one. Keep all evidences and snapshots of your follow up  and confirmation  pressure them to give you when it is due.,btohqsg
I will only go with Moneysmart moving forward  although the gift is not as good as Singsaver  at least I won't burst an artery pressuring them to honour their contract.,btohqsg

Does anyone know what rates Instarem Amaze follows? Heading to Taiwan but can’t seem to find the rate on the app…,btohqsg
Got the response from ocbc. They say it’s based on posted date and not the transaction date. The mechent post few days later. So it closed next mth. The worst part of ocbc is  their posted date is not in the statement. It’s hidden inside the app that u need to drill in for details. Unlike uob where both the statement and app show the post date. Simply sucks. I already lock the credit card and take my business else where.,btohqsg
You can't check it. They'll only tell you after you make the transaction,btohqsg
Qualify for Spend bonus for 360 account? $500 minimum sirBut for 365 credit card  if you want qualify for cashback (I.e 6% dining  3% travel/grab etc) then need spend $800Sry trazora sir ^ I think the question unclear oso haha,btohqsg
Take note the cut off date for CC is based on POSTED date. And not the date shown on the app or statement. Merchant can take up to 7 day to post.,btohqsg
Oh ok. So if 500sgd spend on cc. How much cc spend bonus can get?,btohqsg
So it is 0.6percent on the 500?,btohqsg
On the amount you have in your 360 bank account lor. Interest tabulated monthly,btohqsg
Oh ok. So it is not on the cc spend amount of 500,btohqsg
Sir  As I highlighted above - There is a difference between bonus interest for CC spend for 360 account and the cashback from the 365 credit cardU get both if you spend the necessary and have both 360 bank account and 365 credit cardYw sir,btohqsg

May I know how does EGA works? For normal not premium type. Eg. Deposit 2k monthly for 3months. The promotion rate will be credited after 3 months  meaning at the 4th month. Can I deposit 2k at the start of the month  then withdraw it. Before end of month. I put back the 2k funds?,btohqsg
Are you keeping funds within the account?,btohqsg
So why do you want to put in $2k on 1st and then take out the $2k?,btohqsg
But the rates will only be given at the end of 3rd month.. I rather withdraw the funds n put in my savings acc  end of month put back in the sum I took out,btohqsg
I think you are confusin two separate promotions1) HSBC Everyday+2) HSBC Bonus interest 4.3%,btohqsg
I don't understand. So is your cash staying in HSBC EGA or staying in OCBC 360?,btohqsg
Cash currently staying in HSBC EGA. I want to achieve the 5+% rates~,btohqsg
Yes  then your cash should be staying in HSBC EGA all the way (for 4 months) to enjoy the SMS rates 4.x% p.a.If you move out the cash into OCBC 360  you have no balance in HSBC EGA to earn any interest.,btohqsg
Then u have to keep in EGA,btohqsg
So they take into account of daily balance? The rates I gotten in ocbc 360 is higher than the HSBC EGA LoL,btohqsg
5%+ you will need 2 accounts as you need to move the funds from HSBC A > Outside Account > HSBC B every month.,btohqsg
the 4.x% is based on average daily balance on top of the Reference Month.,btohqsg
Needed 2 acc? I thought fresh fund into newly created EGA will be suffic. Of cuz hitting 2k monthly n 5 transactions,btohqsg
As Chris said  the $2k and 5 transactions is just for HSBC EGA Rewards (which is the 1%s),btohqsg
the 4.x% is your incremental ADB over the reference month ADB.,btohqsg
Ohhh understood. And this only last for 3months?,btohqsg
regardless  both the 1%s and the 4.x% still needs you to keep the cash in HSBC. No bank will pay you interest for all days in the month if you just move the money in one day  then take out one day later.,btohqsg
The 4.x% lasts 4 months. For myself:My reference month is February 2023.I will be paid 4.x% p.a. interest for March April May June 2023.,btohqsg
Then July 2023 I will have to SMS in again to start a new 4 month cycle.Of course the above is the 'basic method' which assumes you only have one human.If you have 2 humans then u have to alternate musical chairs. But you can achieve 5.x% p.a. if you have 2 humans.,btohqsg
The 4.x% only pays out in July right?,btohqsg
for MY case  my fulfilment date is 31st August 2023.All such details can be found in the PDF file. Make sure you save a copy of your own promo.,btohqsg
dont forget HSBC EGA have a min $2k to be kept in the account otherwise you will need to pay a fall below fee,btohqsg
Oh same case. Thus in July I just send in sms again to renew the cycle? Tho I didn't receive such PDF. I ask the customer service directly. They stated august 2023 is my fulfilment date,btohqsg
if only ONE human  then you can't.. because if you SMS in July  your reference month is June (and you had money inside).You have to cooldown one month and keep HSBC EGA empty ($2k) in July and only SMS in August (reference month July),btohqsg
u download the PDF terms and conditions from hsbc website,btohqsg
So basically they need another person. U said can from 1 ega to another EGA(brand new acc). After my completion that is. I will then empty my that account to recycle it:),btohqsg
no i didn't say that..i said:HSBC A to outside to HSBC B.,btohqsg
OPPS  alright. Shall follow this method n get another human ❤️,btohqsg
make sure the 'outside' is ideally a joint account of A/B... otherwise you going to trigger AML checks and questions.,btohqsg
around $50 of you put in around 100k,btohqsg
Wydm by joint acc of A/B. My outside have a joint acc  e.g me and my dad. My dad doesn't have a HSBC acc. The way to recycle requires a joint acc outside and then xfer to the newly created EGA?,btohqsg
HSBC account is probably the most complicated account with the most steps and the worst is you only know the result 6 months later.. ALL OR NOTHING!but it is rewarding since pays up to 5.x% with no salary or spending requirements.,btohqsg
the logic is if you do big amounts from a stranger account into HSBC account  it will trigger checks.If HSBC (you) to joint account (you/father) to hsbc (father).. it is fine.If HSBC (you) to joint account (you/father) to hsbc (wife).. it is not fine.,btohqsg
yes it is haha  most of my money is parked in UOB One  HSBC is just extra bonus,btohqsg
got bank call me and I just reply according,btohqsg
that was because I keep moving money around,btohqsg
For the last statement  as long the funds isn't a very huge amt is fine right?,btohqsg
Not sure isit wise to all in..,btohqsg
I think it's the money movement  not the amount. they want to make sure no money laundering or money mules activity,btohqsg
definitely not wisethere's no clear confirmation abt whether u are doing correctly or no,btohqsg
well if the fund is not large  why do you want the HSBC EGA hassle?,btohqsg
But the rates is darn high tho haha n yeah.. my ocbc 360 getting rates monthly,btohqsg
It's better than ocbc360 with just crediting n save category,btohqsg
I max out ocbc 365 and UOB one  then HSBC.,btohqsg
before I try HSBC I was throwing into GXS and Mira / Trust,btohqsg
uob tricky bit is the $100k is sort of locked in like semi fixed deposit.,btohqsg
but now finally decided to try the more complicated HSBC hope all goes well,btohqsg
What happened if fulfilment is completed and I withdraw 100% sum?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 is higher than HSBC (without 1% bonus)  right?,btohqsg
Just 3.25% with credit n save,btohqsg
uob one equivalent to 5% if 100k,btohqsg
Can I close it lol. No interest anyway,btohqsg
OCBC 360 -> Credit  save n spend is 4.65%  correct ?,btohqsg
Haha I dun spend that much.  Unless it's essential,btohqsg
advisable to always keep your unused accounts and cards.you never know when a new promo comes and by the time you rush to open/apply for it:1. u waste time and miss out the promo2. the product no longer being offered,btohqsg
you can utilise it again with 2000 as the baseline,btohqsg
How to clock the minimum spend of $500 for the $228 cashback from OCBC credit card sign up promotion? It seems like many exclusions. Can share some tips? Thanks! 🙏,btohqsg
pay singtel bill? not sure excluded or not.,btohqsg
So just keep it there? And wait for new promo? Or so?,btohqsg
the only exception is if you are so very 100% sure you have ZERO use for the bank and ALL their products  then go ahead to close then you can qualify for NTB items after 12 months.,btohqsg
you need to send SMS again,btohqsg
so far i haven't not found any bank that I have zero use for... there is at least one valuable credit card per bank.,btohqsg
then it will take a new reference month,btohqsg
But required new human. I only using their HSBC revolution. Once EGA ends  I have no use for it,btohqsg
can throw into GXS/Mari/Trust or other banks for one month then go back to the same HSBC account.,btohqsg
the objective is just to reset the baseline,btohqsg
Throw the 2k out from EGA?? To other banks? Wait for one month to reset? But@mttelegrammtstated requires 2 humans to cycle,btohqsg
now I suddenly have an idea. seems like the HSBC EGA is a good way to reset my OCBC savings. now I need to keep increasing by 500 every month in OCBC.,btohqsg
if you have 2 humans  there is no need to wait one month to reset,btohqsg
2k have to keep in HSBC during the one month too so won't fall below minimum sum,btohqsg
Ohh. So technically I can wait for 1 month.. empty out the acc. Send in sms to recycle as well,btohqsg
Ah noted. 2k min inside. Wait a month to recycle. Else 2 acc which doesn't requires waiting time,btohqsg
yes but if only one human.. your peak interest is only 4.x%.. you will never get the 5.x% p.a. since you can't get the 1% month on month incremental balance bonus,btohqsg
another benefit of keeping the HSBC EGA is for tax giro lor,btohqsg
Don't really understand why can't get the extra 1% since I have on month increment balance..,btohqsg
I currently does that as well. Deposit the rest in HSBC hahaha,btohqsg
the 1% is based on MONTH on MONTH incremental balanceMarch = $100kApril = $110kMay = $125kyou only get 1%p.a. on $10k in April and 1% on $15k in May,btohqsg
u can make use of the account in other ways  i transfer X amount of money to different bank accounts.like $$ meant for auto repairs or house maintenence that kindso the money is separated and i wont use it for no reason,btohqsg
But doesn't required min 100k or so right. Just everymonth increase can le. Only 1% only on topups,btohqsg
As said  you can increase by $10 also can.. but only the INCREASE AMOUNT will earn the 1% p.a.,btohqsg
Haha not much. But money xfer out to HSBC during this promo is still better than ocbc 360 under credit n save condition,btohqsg
I applied for OCBC Titanium Rewards Credit Card. I don’t think it will work with Singtel bill. Can I pair it with Amaze? Any tips to clock $500 using this card?,btohqsg
Anyone knows how the HSBC EGA works with joint acct?E.g. If I have an EGA account  and my dad and I have an EGA joint account and he's the main account holder  does that mean I can loop it between both accounts for the interest or it doesnt work cause my name is in both?,btohqsg
Base 4.4% without crediting n such  better than FD,btohqsg
Oh so just need to open hsbc acc?,btohqsg
Seems to be so and send in sms for promo,btohqsg
Min 2k so won't get charged with fall below fee,btohqsg
So 2k also can get 4.4percent?,btohqsg

With Amaze you can link a rewards Mastercard and earn both InstaPoints and your credit card rewards,btohqsg
Riding on the amaze questions and asking this - will I still have 4mpd if I google pay wth amaze card linked to Citi rewards? Or not?,btohqsg
Just a small caution. When u do a payment with link to link to link  if something messes up like failed payments or refund to be expected  you may not know who to approach. All will wash their hands.,btohqsg
I see. But for the usual overseas transactions during travel like food  shopping etc - will the 4mpd flow as per usual via the google > amaze > citi way?,btohqsg
Just got hsbc revo card approve  just apply for EGA can get bonus cashback?,btohqsg

i cant find any cc without admin fee that will give rewards  if.any credit card provide this  surely game changer,btohqsg
Icic hahaBtw I’m stucked with some 4k in grabpay Wallet and cannot use for any of the insurance bills payment :(What to do next ?,btohqsg
Bet u top up via credit can't transfer,btohqsg
ask for chargeback on the basis they stopped insurance payments and u didn't know when u topped up?,btohqsg
Try ask Grab to refund to the CC used for the topup,btohqsg
I top up some time back liao. N realised no more perk n and no more axs,btohqsg
just try... the nerfing of payment types without notice is a powerful reason,btohqsg
Since you already earn the reward after topping up  Can use it to pay utilities bill? Daily expenses? Air ticket  hotel? Mrt/bus?,btohqsg
arguable grab balance should only be used on payments that are usually excluded by other credit cards?,btohqsg
does anyone know how to pay NTUC Income Insurance to be counted towards UOB One Account qualifying spend?,btohqsg
For the last top up of 1k I didn’t get the reward  missed the date… what a blunder,btohqsg

But one thing i dont like is temporarily  im more interested about the perm type interest 😓😓,btohqsg
where got perm type interest one? yeah maybe those 0.05% accounts can perm type.. haha,btohqsg
Nothing is permanent except death  taxes  and CPF FRS annual increase,btohqsg
SSB lo 😜Anyway  HSBC EGA is a good account to have even if you don't plan to store most of your money there,btohqsg
ssb also not permanent.. 10 years later how? haha,btohqsg
that's why must always pay attention to chat groups for the latest promos and info!,btohqsg
how are these permanent??in fact those are 'lousier' than ega which is far easier to meet the criteria and pay higher rates.,btohqsg
cos if maxed out $100k the incremental $500 each month earning 0.05% only.,btohqsg
yeah man... i also thinking of resetting a spare UOB One account since active UOB One accounts cannot take part in the lock-in ang bao promo,btohqsg
On this  i apply UOB ONE CC with SingSaver $300 promo last year december  now upon ask they say i have to ask UOB. Is that true?,btohqsg
what does tt mean? do u mean open a 2nd uob one acct  under ur own name?,btohqsg
one human can only open one UOB One account.I mean if you have 2 humans total 2 UOB One accounts.. might be worth considering leave 1 UOB One account with just $1k to reset until the next ang bao promo comes along,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to check for tax refund in overseas. Is it okay to provide the amaze card for tax refund ?,btohqsg
this question i asked before... the answer i believe is depends on which tax refund provider is being used,btohqsg
Ahh. I think I made a spelling error earlier on the search bar. Manage to search back to chat. Thanks thanks,btohqsg
This further supports my earlier inclination not to use Singsaver. Check out the TnCs  did it say that it will be fulfilled by UOB? It's very unusual.,btohqsg
Does that mean need to musical chair between OCBC360 n HSBC EGA  every alternate month if want yo have maximum interest for $100k of saving?,btohqsg
Which credit card is best for NTUC?,btohqsg
The cobranded card of course. \s,btohqsg
In all seriousness  the best cards are UOB Lady's (Family category) for miles side  Citi Cash Back and Maybank F&F for cashback side,btohqsg
I no mrs banana i forever alone,btohqsg
I eat alone  sleep alone  pang sai alone also,btohqsg

Got any referral code for cardup?,btohqsg
but EGA need to credit salary tho?,btohqsg
no need. just needed incremental monthly balance,btohqsg
oh but doesn't it mean I have to credit like $2k minimum every month,btohqsg
That's a separate promo. Anyway that doesn't have to be sal  fast transfer also can,btohqsg
o  but I'm jus planning to store like $40k  and leave it there w/o touching it  should I still go w EGA?,btohqsg
so if I'm doing this jus storing my money  what's the interest I'll be getting?cos now I can only see the promo rates,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is the highest interest account now  but it is also very troublesome. If you would like a hassle free option .... HSBC EGA is not for you.,btohqsg
exactly... HSBC EGA although conditions are not hard to meet  it is tedious to understand and implement.Work hard for the interest!,btohqsg
if you got a player 2  can alternate between both accounts via an intermediary non-HSBC account,btohqsg
for my household  we employ the 2 HSBC EGA account strategy so we can get the max interest.At month end  HSBC A > external joint A/B account > HSBC Bthen vice versa.,btohqsg
This is also commonly used for SCB Esaver and RHB promos that all utilise the same incremental ADB mechanics.,btohqsg
Hello! How long did it took from date of reg for the card to reach u?,btohqsg
oh! I see it makes so much sense rn,btohqsg
so I need one of my other household memebrs to create another acc so we can alternate the funds via both accs every month rite,btohqsg
correct  but you also need another bank to be the middle man account.. ideally that should be a joint account to avoid triggering Anti Money Laundering checks.,btohqsg
"so if we do this  this is considered ""fresh funds"" rite?",btohqsg
yes.. that's the point of the middle man joint account,btohqsg
"oh! makes sense  what is your ""middle man joint acc"" bank you're using tho",btohqsg
For my household  because we were lucky enough to be on the 3.8%p.a. Esaver exclusive invite  we use that. It can be used to store the balances across holidays and Sundays if crossing month-end.But any third party bank will also work. Just remember my tip on making sure it is a joint account that matches with your HSBC A and HSBC B account. This is the most important.,btohqsg
"what do you mean by ""match"" tho? haha sorry am still new to the strategy for HSBC EGA",btohqsg
HSBC A = HusbandHSBC B = WifeSCB Joint = Husband/Wife Joint,btohqsg
ohh okayy! thanks so much  so basically everytime at the very end of the month you do this?,btohqsg
if I'm utilising HSBC EGA promo yes,btohqsg

what is the point of doing this?,btohqsg
UOB One at 5% p.a. is also very good.,btohqsg
It's just for moving the cash out in the middle month (adb becomes $2k/$5k) right?,btohqsg
Why do I need both HSBC A and HSBC B?,btohqsg
i'm also new to this hsbc ega promo. just try to understand.if i hv 100k and dun hv other spare cash  i will just stay with uob one  bcoz 5% p.a. is quite good le...but if i hv spare cash (other than the 100k)  i can apply for hsbc ega  n shift money into hsbc ega... is this correct?,btohqsg
Should be either1) HSBC A and HSBC B2) HSBC A and 1 external account (eg. Esaver)No?,btohqsg
The aim is to earn 5.x% p.a. with HSBC EGA at all times.,btohqsg
if you have EXACTLY $100k  then probably yes to just having UOB One.If you have $60k? Ditch UOB One.. for HSBC EGAs$150k? $100k in UOB One  $50k in HSBC EGAs.,btohqsg
if i wanna make use of the next uob ang bao promo  maybe i need to move funds out of uob one to hsbc ega  nearer the year end or so... this is assuming that i dont have another pax to create another uob one acct (back to the qn i asked this morning). is this correct?,btohqsg
"that is so far away... but i'm betting uob will have another ""ang bao"" promo on 1st july 2023  referencing 30th June day end balance.. BUT THIS IS PURELY MY GUESS.",btohqsg

that is why need HSBC A and HSBC B and outside A/B,btohqsg
Month 1/2/3 all earn 5.xx% p.a. I won't assume 5.45% since the promo lock in rate changes monthly.,btohqsg
If only have 1 person  what is the best strategy?,btohqsg
maybe as per what u outlined loh.but go find another trusted human la.. it is so much more useful for playing all these games.,btohqsg
ega 4.x% bonus interest for 4 months or alternate ega and uob one like u mentioned,btohqsg
btw jus curious  why 4 monthly cycles? after 4 months the promo no more?,btohqsg
bonus interest promo is for 4 months window  then need to empty out on 5th month  and can start the new cycle from 6th month,btohqsg
after 4 months  you have to register again  and be subject to the mercy of whatever is the rate then.,btohqsg
technically if you only one human  you have a 5 month window (you need month 5 to be a minimal balance account). Then month 6 first day u can SMS in and month 5 will be the reference month.,btohqsg

I have my reasons not to deal with HSBC. It’s not because it’s the bank of opium war that brings shame for my race for more than a century (although they are)  it’s simply HSBC are too much of a hassle. More so when they closed many many branches.,btohqsg
That was then and that’s why HSBC is one of the Big Four banks in UK  and some say the world.History lesson aside HSBC TnCs are longer than my grandmas favorite Taiwanese drama serials,btohqsg

anyone got any suggestions regarding this? 😅😁,btohqsg
Can speak to their customer service that you have used it for over ten days. I've seen cases where the Revolut CSO asks for proof of it by asking for screenshots in TL SimplyGo apps.,btohqsg
Walao Barclays not even on top 20?Remember Visa is the payment system spin-off of Barclays of England + Bank of America  California . Both world class banksBefore Chase swallow the regional banks  Bank of America is THE bank in America. They financed Disney  set up Visa and literally built out Silicon Valley AND Los Angeles with their loans.,btohqsg

no need activate anything  just use lah,btohqsg
What abt HSBC A > external joint A account > joint HSBC A/B?,btohqsg
System wise passes the check.But strictly speaking can be deemed by bank to not be fresh funds. Up to u if u want to take the risk.,btohqsg
Will not work. The issue is that their definition of incremental fresh funds include all hsbc accounts with your name in them  regardless of whether it's joint or single acc,btohqsg
Unless you don't have a common account owner between the single and joint accounts  then it will work,btohqsg
“Deposits ADB” means the sum of average daily balances for a given calendar month  taking into account the deposits in customer’s Eligible Account. For the avoidance of doubt  Deposits ADB excludes all deposits in HSBC Premier Accounts  SGD Current Accounts  SGD Savings Accounts  Singapore Dollar Time Deposit accounts  Secured Overdraft Accounts  SmartMortgage Accounts  Flexi Accounts  eFlexi Accounts and Investment Financing Accounts.“Fresh Funds” means a deposit of funds from outside of HSBC into the Eligible Account. Transfers from existing HSBC bank deposit accounts or via HSBC cheque(s)  cashier’s order (s) or demand draft(s) do not qualify. Funds that are transferred from existing or closed HSBC accounts in the last 30 days are also excluded.,btohqsg
It will actually work based on practical experiences. But as said if hsbc wants to implement the tnc will allow them to disqualify the 1% bonus.Because definition of eligible account is hsbc Ega account with them. Which includes both the single and joint account balances.,btohqsg

lucky for you. I had tried to apply online to open EGA account. It said that I was ineligible to open. I have a Revo CC btw. Left my contact details on their website  no response for 2 weeks. Contacted via app. CSO say I have to go down to a branch to open  as only users with deposit accounts can apply online,btohqsg
So best advice would be to open EGA account tgt with HSBC Revo application online,btohqsg

Do you still have student rates on your student ezlink card?,btohqsg
I used AMEX SQ and got SQ miles,btohqsg
Since you're under 21 you won't be able to apply for credit cards. DBS Visa debit card and UOB One debit card give 3% cashback if you can hit $400 and $500 min spend per month respectively,btohqsg
If you don't spend that much a month  you can use SC Jumpstart debit card for 1% cashback.Also  Revolut occasionally has promos for bus and MRT rides cashback that you can look out for (will be announced in this grouo when it happens),btohqsg
Just curious but will this affect the moneysmart promo in the future,btohqsg
Thanks. So amex got miles. If mine is cash back should have too right,btohqsg
It won't affect your new to bank status for credit card applications if that's what you're asking. But you'll miss out on bank account opening promos in future,btohqsg
But it may have cap of cashback u get.. Just try to find the T&C,btohqsg
SC Jumpstart account doesn't really have any signup promotions so that one should be safe to apply anytime,btohqsg
Already have that but wanted something more. Is new to bank bonus usually large?,btohqsg
No. Highest I've seen so far is Citi Plus at $100 last time,btohqsg
wow this offer is good. Valid for Cardup?,btohqsg
So new to bank holder is usually only additional $100 or something around there?,btohqsg
If you're first time buying get hdb loan is cheaper than banks. I'd recommend continue working and clock your cpf. Cash is liquid. You'll never know when emergency hits.,btohqsg
Most of the time for student accounts it's $18. E.g. OCBC Frank and SFL Vivid,btohqsg
I mean for new to bank while getting credit card usually the rewards difference between new to bank and new to card is only $100,btohqsg
Banks usually don't give signup rewards for existing account holders to open a new bank account with the same bank,btohqsg

What is so attractive in hsbc ega?,btohqsg
May I know anyone know the answer ? I’m not sure that I’m right or not about the EGA Bonus interest 4.3% actually there is an additional 1% Everyday+interest will be credited 14 days after each month ended eligible upon 5+transaction on the account and another EGA 4.3% bonus interest will be credited on the fulfilment date which make it total 5.3 %,btohqsg
Ocbc need salary credit and save bonus to hit 4%. HSBC ega no need. The only downside is the reset every few month.,btohqsg
My understanding on HSBC ega.Just put in fresh fund. Earn 4.3% PA for 3-4mth.First mth get extra 1% for everyday+ if u perform 5 fast transaction.,btohqsg
If second mth put >2000. This 2k will earn 4.3+1%. The existing 4.3%,btohqsg
MaybeMay 100k +5 transaction (5.3)Jun +2k +5 Tran (100k 4.3. 2k 5.3)Jul +2k +5 TranAug +2k +5 Tran.Then Oct collect all yr interest,btohqsg
Or just hoot 100k +5 Tran for 5.3% one mth. The rest collect 4.3%.,btohqsg
Seems quite a lot of ppl prefer hsbc revo here  what's really good about it? hsbc advance also offer 2.5% cashback without the need to convert points to cashback  less hassle.,btohqsg

No need spent. Just transfer $10 to yr other bank acct for 5 time.,btohqsg
But need top up 2k monthy,btohqsg
you know the deposit 2k is withdrawable right 😬,btohqsg
U need to spend 2k to get 2.5% that's the difference,btohqsg
but revo only gives 2.5% for online and contactless only  other than that is 1/10th of it too...,btohqsg
but.... where will u not use online/contactless 😳The card swipe one abit nowhere to be seen le,btohqsg
I only Revo to do 5x tranx..get the extra 1% that's it.Don't see a point to spend so much,btohqsg
makes sense.. I was still thinking about the old limit for paywave where it does not allow payment above $100 and needs to put cards in,btohqsg
interesting point and valid  but i think this limit would have raised by now bah else go shop for groceries abit funny le,btohqsg

Hi all  wanted to check the HSBC revolution card  what’s the cash equivalent for reward points? e.g. 4000 points = S$10?,btohqsg
Nothing beats UOB lady’s 6mpd. Comparable to Revo and versatility is Amaze>CRMC. I understand OCBC Titanium/ DBS WWMC is for gd for online / shopping transactions for 4mpd.,btohqsg
If you do a quick search on YouTube review  it’s about 2.5% cashback (rebate off your next credit card bill),btohqsg
So the cashback isn’t necessarily a direct points to cash conversion  it rebates off the next bill,btohqsg
Wish I can use that but last I checked my D is still there 😢,btohqsg
From what I understand is if I make an eligible spend of $10  I will receive 100 points due to the 10x points. So is the cashback in the form of 2.5% cash rebate or points redemption?,btohqsg
There is an option to choose either cashback rebate or keep points for transfer to airline carriers’ miles program.,btohqsg
Only for ladies  to be bad for us 😅,btohqsg
Do simple search on YouTube  if I’m not wrong either Chris/ Demi Zhuang talks about this points conversation and calculation.,btohqsg
Road tax use paypal  add uob absolute to paypal,btohqsg
yeah usual cashback cards are the ones with min spend... hence once hit.. you go for the overflow cashs with no min spend since usually last minute cannot hit min spends .,btohqsg

To add on to this reply. Samsung Pay  Google Pay and Apple Pay are 'Mobile Contactless'. However  if these modes are integrated as payment modes to merchant shopping portal  it would be online transaction.,btohqsg

In hotel. But also in general like restaurants outside. There’s separate cashback cards for that?,btohqsg
Good to know! I didn’t know this,btohqsg
Since no income yet  I can only provide general generic recommendation.Make sure expenses are less than the amounts u get from parents.Any idle surplus keep in higher yielding bank accounts.Try to get debit cards that earn u rewards when u spend.,btohqsg
Citibank cashback card May exclude certain hotel restaurant spends. Exact list I also don’t know but I would play safe and not use Citi cashback at hotels. This is from my memory based on their hotel banquet exclusions (I don’t know if still enforced).Non hotel restaurants feel free to use Citibank cashback for 6% cashback.,btohqsg

GXS Bank  Maribank  SIF Gosaver  CIMB Fastsaver  RHB HYSA to think of a few,btohqsg
Why do u need so many. Just one is enough.,btohqsg
Aside from CIMB FastSavers:1. POSB My Account- No minimum balance- 2000+ ATMs islandwide- 0.05% interest2. Standard Chartered Jumpstart account- No minimum balance- ~200 ATMs islandwide  19 branches to deposit cash- 2% interest- 1% cashback on all Mastercard debit card spend,btohqsg

Yeah right! Just to know the options,btohqsg
That's very helpful! Thank you so much,btohqsg
No problem! If you're trying to optimize for high interest  I recommend you go with one digital bank account to keep your savings (e.g. GxS  Maribank  SIF GoSavers) and a physical bank account to deposit and withdraw cash (e.g. POSB My Account  SC Jumpstart  CIMB FastSavers),btohqsg
So you are monitoring logging it daily to Excel? Can share with me thanks.But seems like too much micro management,btohqsg
Hi all. I've been comtemplating whether to even post this question here for a bit. I am preparing to send one of my aged relative to a private nursing home. The monthly outlay will be large.

Hi experts just wanted to check if stores like adidas/royal sporting house are eligible to 4mpd when using the OCBC titanium card  does anyone happen to know their mcc?,btohqsg
For the webull promo  do you all open a margin or cash account?,btohqsg
If u are using absolute 1.7-50’cents u still gain 1.20,btohqsg
Use the dbs disable card trick to find out the MCC. Then give an excuse like your card having issues you'll come back later/another day so you can figure out which card to use.Else you can bring all your cards the use sth like heymax to quickly check on the spot,btohqsg
Hi Trazora  how about mile card? Does Maybank VI and Maybank World master? Do they get miles for education spending?,btohqsg
I try not to have too much activity for the card so I don't really have to micro manage. just need to use the excel to compute the amount of interest+salary to shift out every month so that the increase in the average daily balance is 501 only.,btohqsg
I am Not sure the MCC code but remember to use Kris+ app benefit to earn additional 3 Kris+ miles per dollar  and perhaps the 10% discount if applicable. You can check if it is MCC 5655 for Adidas n MCC 5941 for Royal sporting.,btohqsg
VI 1.2mpd for local  2mpd for foreign spend. World master at most 1x points only,btohqsg
Does amaze + citi rewards eligible for 10x of hospital bill?,btohqsg

Yes. If only 1 human. Then u need to rest one month with minimal balance to reset the reference month.,btohqsg
In your experience  is it about few months ? Years ? 🙂,btohqsg
It has nothing to do with past experiences. It has to do with interest rate environment which nobody but fed can decide.Past experiences do not translate to future performances.,btohqsg
It works by cal mth? So I should trf out on 1 Aug?,btohqsg
Then sms on 1st October. Rest whole September.,btohqsg
High interest rates meaning high inflation as well. So nothing good about it. It just hedge against some inflation only.,btohqsg
I think in the t and c  if you keep ADB $200k for 6 months  you get $600 cash,btohqsg

provided new to HSBC and it is $300 or $150  not $600. Not really worth it since getting only 0.05% on 5th and 6th month,btohqsg
Anyone know how to pay the mthly town council sncc via citi payall ?,btohqsg

It depends on the credit card t&c. No common standard for all credit cards.,btohqsg
I did a search and saw that it does for a few banks  for my case specifically for citi its supposed to count as qualifying spend but I called citi and they told me that it wasn't..,btohqsg
"in what way it ""supposed to count""?",btohqsg
If u save more than u consume  high interest rates is good.,btohqsg
Does anybody know golden moment is under what MCC code ?,btohqsg

Hi guys does contactless payment at Sinopec earn 4mpd using HSBC revo?,btohqsg
Unfortunately it only earns 0.4mpd. Better cards would be UOB lady's  or UOB PPV,btohqsg
Sinopec 23% (fri  weekend) + OCBC got 5% rebate better right?,btohqsg
Yap technically 28% total. I think now ocbc Is 6% rebate,btohqsg
Tomorrow shell last day vpower for the price of shell 98.,btohqsg
should look at the actual TnC lah,btohqsg
Sinopec can also work with- Maybank FnF for 8%- Evol contactless for 8% (6.67% Ecb)- Citi cash back for 8%,btohqsg
So effective about 29.16 if with 8% cb ya,btohqsg
Can we use Maybank FnF with Amaze?,btohqsg
If May 100k + 5 transactions  (5.3)Jun +22k + 5 tran (100k 4.3 22k 5.3)Jul put +2k + 5 tran but take out -10k will the bal of 110k still get 4.3 interest?,btohqsg

Morning all  Do you guys cancel your unused credit cards? Or ask for waivers every year although you never use it?,btohqsg
2 choices:1. cancel your unused credit cards such that you can qualify for New to Bank status every X period (depends on each bank's policy).2. keep your unused credit cards because there could suddenly be an amazing promo which could revive usage of the card. If you had cancelled the card  it might no longer be offered or waiting for approval of the card could cause you to miss the promo.,btohqsg

Depends what time  late afternoon will reflect in dbs on the next working day,btohqsg
yes  can tag the card to Amaze  convert everything to online  earn 3mpd for online spend on some of the MCCs. Useful when u maxed out your 4mpd cards. Can still clock bonus miles when paired with the kf savings account.,btohqsg
Personally gonna stick with Citi PM  it's a general spend card so it's really rarely used. Points expire with the T1 Card  but not CitiPM or DBS altitude,btohqsg
I personally use Toshl (it's paid) for tracking across multiple banks. But in general excel should be sufficient,btohqsg
Should tally as payment is via Google Pay,btohqsg
Can we pay town council monthly fee via SAM using uob amex and still earn 1.7 cash rebate?,btohqsg

UOB cancel card fromApp immediate sia lol. Efficient,btohqsg
SCB also super efficient in this aspect.Note: UOB prevents you to apply for the same card one year plus one month or more from canceling the card,btohqsg
