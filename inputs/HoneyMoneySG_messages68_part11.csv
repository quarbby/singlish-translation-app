Hello everyone  I signed up for uob national savings promotion on Sept 28 for the ending date January 15 via stash account as uob one maxed out at 100K.My June 30 balance was1K in Stash and 100K in One.2 questions:1. When will the earmarked funds in stash account disappear from the display2. How much balance should I maintain until the end of promo jan 15  2024 to get the cash rewardAppreciate any inputs from your experience with this pls as I can‚Äôt seem to reach the CSO,btohqsg
Usually about late afternoon / evening,btohqsg
Tks. I cycled SSB with borrowed funds (from ibkr) so wanna return asap üòÇ,btohqsg
Can I check usually UOB one account latest e-statement will be available at which day of the month in app?,btohqsg
hihi  wonder any great FD rates for October 2023?,btohqsg
Can I know when will the interest for sep be credit for uob one. I completed the bonus interest.,btohqsg
Hi all  I‚Äôm planning to buy Steigen mcc 5722. They have an option using shopback paylater.I am wondering if I use dbsww and make the payment via shopback pay later  will I be entitled to 4mpd?,btohqsg
question  is it better to redeem from SSB and put it into moomoo funds to earn the 1 month interest rate?,btohqsg
If I purchase it on Shopee? Would it be advisable? In terms of maximising the rewards,btohqsg
I pay for my pilates classes via punchpass.  Does that fall into the contactless or online payment for the hsbc revol card? Punchpass is a site that houses the studios (like shopee for physical goods but it is ‚Äúshopee‚Äù for fitness classes),btohqsg
if never empty uob one acct on 30 sep  does it mean that there is no point signing up for this ?,btohqsg
depends if u have another stash of fresh funds that is not earning high interest. Topup Uob Stash is an option.,btohqsg
If i pay via installment via Lazada using DBS WWMC or any other miles card  do i still earn 4mpd ?,btohqsg
no miles if installment with bank.,btohqsg
0% installment very attractive  until the bank decides not to waive your annual fee and you have to choose between early termination fee or paying the annual fee.,btohqsg
will be in the the next few working days,btohqsg
hi hi i just apply the citi reward card when will know successful or not Ôºü need to wait few dayÔºü,btohqsg
Maybe you ask yourself if this effort is worth the $2 fee + incremental 30-day interest. And after 30days  you may lose another few days of interest depending on your next step,btohqsg
new to citibank credit card or existing card owner,btohqsg
hi just a question for those using shopback and apple  I bought some stuff on apple shop during their 5% upsized cashback  but the card hasnt been charged yet as i selected delivery  now the 5% cashback is over  will i still get the 5% cashback when the card is finally charged in a few days  or back to their normal 1%?,btohqsg
Take note that the capital is non guaranteed only the bonus interest 5.8% is guaranteed. This is low risk investment  not a risk free investment like the SSB.,btohqsg
the cashback rate used for tracking should be based on time of purchase.. not time when card is charged  in my opinion.Although apple is known for funny things like the transaction becomes an offline transaction manually processed.,btohqsg
i see  thank you! will just wait with fingers crossed then,btohqsg
will take a few days. i got mine after a week or so,btohqsg
Even the MCC also can change after transaction has been made  only make things very confusing.,btohqsg
I thought it's second business day of the month,btohqsg
On a separate note Oct SSB announcement is out!https://www.mas.gov.sg/bonds-and-bills/auctions-and-issuance-calendar/issuance-singapore-savings-bond?issue_code=GX23110V&issue_date=2023-11-01,btohqsg
may i know what is the best date to terminate the SSB for the past issue date?,btohqsg
now also can.. since the redemption date is once a month  doesn't matter when u submit,btohqsg
Anyone know if applying for SSB when overseas on Banking App will face any problems/blocking?,btohqsg
oic  so the interest don affect,btohqsg
nope everyone will get their money back all on the same day  don't care when u submitted... interest will be calculated all on the same date too.,btohqsg
i got apply for Tbill  don face any problems,btohqsg
Looks like SSB redemption is still not in,btohqsg
Wow just saw this. Wonder if will have any over subscription situation,btohqsg
unlikely because interest rates still high  don't think will be so hot.,btohqsg
Misread earlier question but I don't want to waste my comment. So just typing out again.got DP saying if you subscribe after you put in a redemption request  it is fine..Example you have $200k SSBs now. You submit a redemption for $50k on 4th October. You are able to submit a subscription for $50k on 5th October.Everything will be processed for November.,btohqsg
Yup not yet. I have been checking too,btohqsg
If it helps  I got the 1st Oct due SSB interest payment already,btohqsg
Does anyone have a DP what happens for SCB Non Priority Banking Customers who maintain a $0 balance savings account while having positive balances in other savings account?If they are unable to deduct the fall below fee from the $0 balance savings account  what will SCB do?,btohqsg
If I pay m1 bills through AXS machine  will it be entitle for the cashback for Uob One CC?,btohqsg
no  AXS excluded. pay on m1 app/ website instead,btohqsg
How to pay m1 bills for parents using my CC?,btohqsg
use your card pay on their account on m1 app/website?,btohqsg
Which means need to use m1 apps to make payment?,btohqsg
The funny part is. Parents don‚Äôt have m1 apps one.  I don‚Äôt stay with them. And moreover  I don‚Äôt think they have m1 apps in their phone,btohqsg
Has anyone used moomoo's 10-day 5% fund plus coupon?  Is it worth?  How is the experience?  Thanks.,btohqsg
Can someone advise if its ideal to use HSBC revo (crmc + amaze maxed out) for foreign currency spending  or to use cards like trust and etc.,btohqsg
For UOB  hotline told me that account will be negative balance (-$5) i.e. overdraft with interest charged. Not sure for SCB though.,btohqsg
SCB Supersalary no minimum balance  for non priority too.,btohqsg
