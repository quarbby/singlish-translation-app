85-100k for Cat A is the new normal,btohqsg
2030 will cease selling of ICE car,btohqsg
Lol a lot of pattern can come out,btohqsg
So then whens the right time to get an ev since we have to get 1 in 5.5yrs time?,btohqsg
Good chance postponing if even simpler internal affairs like simplygo n erp 2.0 can defer many years,btohqsg
You dun have to get an EV in 5yrs time  if you dun wan to get an EV  you only can look at used car market lo 🤭,btohqsg
It's just that if you wan to buy a new car  in 5yrs time there's only EVs,btohqsg
Wasn't ERP2.0 deferred due to COVID?,btohqsg
deferred primarily due to technical and operational considerations rather solely due covid,btohqsg
These 2 are different areas  I dun think there's anything to stop 2030 unless there's no EV supply  but that is impossible looking at how manufacturers are pushing out EVs,btohqsg
Lol back to this qn  I think is when coe drop 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Or change perspective  mindset  as in look at the type e.g. EV or ice or hybrid  rather than the market e.g. new car or used car markets,btohqsg
So even if 2030 comes  you still can get a non-ev,btohqsg
Hybrid kinda pointless for my low usage ~15k/yr. The petrol saving vs the excess i paid for the car. Nt worth to get hybrid leh i calculated,btohqsg

"hi guys! i've been visiting singapore since wednesday and i've used a getgo car twice since then (from airport to my hotel on wednesday and today a longer drive around singapore)now they have suspended my account and are demanding that i pay a combined 800 sgd of ""clean up fees"" cause i smoked in the cars.. 🤦‍♀️ does anyone have any idea if i can end up in trouble if i just ignore it and don't pay?",btohqsg
im not sure if u can run without paying. getgo is one of the car sharing providers in singapore. all these car sharing providers often over charge like this,btohqsg
yeah but like they weren't able to charge my card and i'm leaving in three weeks.. like what can they even do if i don't pay?,btohqsg
They cant do shit to u,btohqsg
U are a piece of thrash for smoking in the car lol,btohqsg

I think these ministers hold high positions of authority n earn a lot. They r responsible for ensuring the overall effectiveness of services under their governance. Even if they do not directly manage the tech centers  they r ultimately accountable 4 the performance of their ministries.,btohqsg
If link their salaries to performance  including critical tech reliability  it will incentivise ministers to be more proactive in addressing potential issues.Means more thorough checks n improved risk management,btohqsg
lol would it be better if i stopped the car in the middle of the road and stepped outside every time i need a cig then? 😂🤦‍♀️,btohqsg
but the thing is that it's just a clean up fee or something and not like a fine given by the police,btohqsg
Control ur urge. U r driving a RENTED car. If personal by all means go ahead. Not everyone likes the smoke smell. It isnt illegal  speaks volumes abt yr ethics for others.,btohqsg
oh come on i'm not gonna buy my own car here when i'm visiting for three weeks,btohqsg
if someone is so bothered by the smell they can open the windows and spray some air freshener,btohqsg
So i shudnt flush the toilet if i use it b4 u? Since u cant tolerate the hygiene u can ownself flush?,btohqsg
lol what are you talking about 😂😂,btohqsg
It is written in their Terms and Conditions..,btohqsg
You do you about what you want to do with this information,btohqsg
Will die meh if you never smoke,btohqsg
but it's terms and conditions  not the law.. i could write that anyone who comes to my hotel room has to pay a $1 000 fee but if someone doesn't pay what can i do? 🤷‍♀️,btohqsg
they will try charging the card information  and perhaps lodge a report,btohqsg
Huh tourist can drive GetGo meh? The T&C put tourist cannot use,btohqsg
i already blocked payments going to them,btohqsg
maybe they will ask me to pay a million dollars if they find out i'm a tourist..,btohqsg
Then probably lodge a police report with whatever you provided them for personal information,btohqsg
Haha probably! I know tourist arn’t allowed to drive GetGo rentals. Do they have evidence that you smoke in the car?,btohqsg
T&C say clean up fee is $300. the person say they got charged $800?,btohqsg
Ya cleaning fee is $300  $800 pluck from where,btohqsg
@emmathiccshow us the invoice to validate,btohqsg
but what can the police even do,btohqsg
maybe i left some ashes in the cup holders but i threw all the butts out before returning the cars both times,btohqsg
U foreigner right? I think they will just write off $800 as bad debt. Sue u not worth the hassle,btohqsg
Can you show us the invoice let us see the damage you had to pay,btohqsg
that's another thing i don't get after seeing the terms and conditions here.. i feel like they're just trying to rip me off and hope that i just pay and shut up,btohqsg
U can don’t pay. It’s not against the law,btohqsg
they want me to pay clean up fees of $800.. 300 for the first rental and 500 for the second,btohqsg
You should try smoking in the MRT or bus too.,btohqsg
lol i rented a getgo so i wouldn't have to,btohqsg
Maybe in the cab going back to the airport,btohqsg
Huh you have 2 occurence that you smoke or 1 time? Haha,btohqsg
If cannot obey rules better don't rent get go...,btohqsg
I think this 1 small problem,btohqsg
U have not seen bigger problems like car n driver missing  car Sold in msia   car used for drugs etc,btohqsg
I think getgo should count their blessings that u even tried to return the car to them intact. Quite funny they actually tried to chase u for smoking fee,btohqsg
U should just magically disappear with the car lol,btohqsg
lol 😂 i'm a good girl i won't do that 😇,btohqsg

Don't need guaranteed bid if u are not urgent,btohqsg
If u are lucky u can still get first try,btohqsg
Either u put in same bid as last bid or bid higher than last bid,btohqsg
i see  so best is non guaranteed  without topup? hahah,btohqsg
Probably. If u are really really keen to get the car asap and are okay to pay additional  then guaranteed bid. Otherwise non guaranteed is okay as well though there's a chance it takes longer time,btohqsg

But a lot of us riders are reluctant to move over to EV bikes. Even some current existing bikes are China-made ones that can be found from AliExpress and maybe even Taobao.,btohqsg
I give you honest opinion ah  cus I drive car and ride motorcycle. As a rider  I have to ride defensively and stay attentive  because I control my bike with little to no rider aids. No TC  no ABS  no radar cruise control  no autonomous braking  no cage. I'm sitting on a frame with a fuel tank and engine in front of my nuts. It is MY OWN responsibility to jaga myself and I ride the bike  not bike ride me mah 😂. Mainly  it is the rider's judgment and situation awareness that determines if he comes home alive to live another day. Can? 😊,btohqsg
Mk  please take this with a pinch of salt  okay? 😁👍,btohqsg
It's a fact. Riding a bike is riskier than a car. Always stay alert.,btohqsg

Take care and stay alert always to all bike riders herein!,btohqsg
Sorry  can translate? I don't understand 🙏🏽,btohqsg
No amt of defensive riding n attention can protect u from the sheer stupidity and recklessness of other drivers. U can be as attentive as u want but it only take 1 idiot texting while driving to turn u into roadkill. U don’t control the road u share it with countless morons who can’t see past their steering wheels.t,btohqsg

non-PHV usually is about 10-13k km per year,btohqsg

Max Non PHV 20k a year,btohqsg
anything less than 10k is very low mileage,btohqsg
assuming milage is real (not tampered with)2 year old car at 48k km  still normal but abit on the high side,btohqsg

Wah so the rumours are real  360 vr cars is a dodgy dealer,btohqsg
Back then when I was dealing with the car times dealer  he took the money but delayed the transfer  I had to chase him  and he said I should transfer the money to him instead of straight to the car times .,btohqsg
So  big company doesn't mean safer,btohqsg
Shudnt it be pay on the spot,btohqsg
The dealers I go to ask me sit n wait,btohqsg
Then on the spot trf to me,btohqsg

Hello everyone  I'm looking for a drop,btohqsg
anyone buy second hand toyota from borneo before? is it more reliable than dealerships?,btohqsg
Just treat it like any other dealership.  They are still out to earn your money. 🤣,btohqsg
hahaha i looking at altis should be fine? 😅,btohqsg
Toyota car is bread n butter. Doesnt mean buy from AD means reliable. They still break down just that they have less tech n more plastic parts. Repair generally cheaper,btohqsg
Recall u been asking for very long. Have u test drove any? Why toyota for ur 1st car anyway?,btohqsg
oic! so far i only tested some 2nd hand ones like vezel  sienta  vios  mazda 3,btohqsg
i also not sure but my frens mostly is say toyota coz of reliability! mainly looking for something more reliable over performance,btohqsg
wah i didnt expect bmw to be lowest,btohqsg
1st of all don get the misconception that toyota is reliable. If no take care they also break down like the rest. All cars which r well taken care of are in general quite reliable,btohqsg
i see  then are there any models you would recommend  or what are some important factors when choosing that someone new might overlook?,btohqsg
Toyota has less tech so they have less things to worry that part is true,btohqsg
2023 / 2024 sienta. best fit this criteria. lol,btohqsg
It really depends on ur budget and requirement bro,btohqsg
Vios is sedans vezel is suv though. Is it for newborn? If yes just eliminate all sedans. If getting those left 2-3 yrs car ok to get from AD due to extra warranty. Otherwise no point. Their inspection is worse than dealers. Seen sime darby listed 1 accident car before,btohqsg
I owned Vios  Corolla  Jazz  Corolla,btohqsg
I owned velosters golf forte Impreza n vezel,btohqsg
Plus axia Yaris n Mazda 3,btohqsg
If u can own all la,btohqsg
toyota is low maintenance girlfriend  doesn't mean NO maintenance hor lol,btohqsg
Less tech in a way but what about hybrid Toyotas?,btohqsg
No maintenance  both gf and car also no happy.,btohqsg
generally i think its a great car with low maintenance,btohqsg
doesnt seem to very less tech leh  with the TSS 3.0. im impressed. lol,btohqsg
Sienta is a good choice for its space and fuel efficiency. Except it don’t looks good  imo. Lol.,btohqsg
Yessss. Totally agree.FC good  space good  maneuvering good  looks not so good  speed not so good.,btohqsg
I just bought one last month. Lol.,btohqsg
Looks wise  can do something about it like maybe divert the attention away from the ugly part. Lol,btohqsg
Example. Photo taken off ig. This way sienta looks good.,btohqsg
i find the dimensions awkwardly small,btohqsg
U want full sized its either Noah or vellfire alr,btohqsg
I'll pick the Sienta over freed any day.Freed 3rd roll fold up  yes convenient but sacrifice space. Cannot put in 3 adult bicycle.,btohqsg
And it's cat B. Not so budget friendly already.,btohqsg
Freed has new FL already? 😳 that's fast.,btohqsg
I thought the latest one was out in 2023 only.,btohqsg
Thts a fake new freed by KM and PI,btohqsg
