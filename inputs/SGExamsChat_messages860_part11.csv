I personally don't like psp ravi guy,btohqsg
Cause I feel his daughter is 1 drama queen who like to create politics tension between ppl,btohqsg
I was thinking if politics are allowed here ?,btohqsg
Like wouldn't it cause chaos ?,btohqsg
Well there is sth a bit political that I want to discuss about,btohqsg
Why single mothers don't get baby bonus uh ?,btohqsg
Because they didn't want to encourage unwed mum,btohqsg
But tbh our birth is already below replacement level,btohqsg
If it is..there will be alot of them,btohqsg
So shouldn't there be a legal mechanism to reduce abortion rates ?,btohqsg
Because of the high cost of living.. but then if you say ours high also not that high if you compared to Australia,btohqsg
There's always case to case just not declare,btohqsg
Like I find it strange too uh,btohqsg
To increase birth rate   you must decrease abortion rates too right ?,btohqsg
But don't forget not all can afford to raise 1 child singlely without parents' support,btohqsg
So but supporting abortion rates. It will have side effects,btohqsg
When they're trying to 1 complete family,btohqsg
If any member of the parliament court or mp misbehave or any mistress they will be asked to leave..that's beside another part,btohqsg
Complete Family or happy family the term-ology,btohqsg
I find it our policy particularly problematic though   they claim that we have below replacement for birth,btohqsg
Yet dun welcome every child equally,btohqsg
Because they've seen the child not growing up in a proper family..leading to crimes for most of them. Only a partial of them less crimes,btohqsg
I mean I even heard of a case where a mom bf actually passed away so ...,btohqsg
Thus they feel in the public eyes not acceptable,btohqsg
Because in the public eyes which we are the audience are judging,btohqsg
So if we judge..how to approve the law?,btohqsg
You know the status ..why she's 1/2 blind?,btohqsg
Because some rules we can see..and cover ..some can't,btohqsg
So at the end..see which sides you prefer..be the audience or get judged?,btohqsg
She kept the child and decided to take on mother responsibility,btohqsg
But she dun seemed to get benefit from govt though based on our current govt way of working,btohqsg
Then how she is going to raise the child when she's barely enough? Study and work? When the milk for the child is expensive? Is not like the govt not helping them. They have 1 room hdb..which they rent from the govt. They even have an association to help them find job. Just that most of them will find a way not to work.. break the system. That's why we feel not enough,btohqsg
Because sometimes we don't see the whole picture,btohqsg
Hmm ... exact details not quite sure ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Is not that the govt not compassionate..it's just who managed the corporation,btohqsg
Then we think govt not good,btohqsg
But her bf family supporting her through   her relationship is known to both families,btohqsg
That's all I wanted to hear when I asked her on this matter,btohqsg
Probably she only tell you 1 sidee of the picture,btohqsg
Cause she's just being human to tell you the not good side..,btohqsg
I see .... her bf was the founder of the Chinese Language materials project I mentioned earlier,btohqsg
I was just his successor lol,btohqsg
I'm not any saint. But because I just happened to see the ugly side of why they land up there.,btohqsg
Usually they won't reveal the whole story..,btohqsg
But I do know some ppl similar cases to what you mentioned,btohqsg
There's this girl who know her bf.. then she was pregnant. Her bf was in army,btohqsg
But few yrs later..they were not tog anymore,btohqsg
Her parents on the other hand is mid range..what i meant mid range is..slight above average family. Her family open hair saloon..have franchise,btohqsg
We're not the best person to talk for them,btohqsg
As for education of the child mentioned in the case I brought up  she ain't worried but I feel if government wants more children   they must be able to stop excess abortion,btohqsg
