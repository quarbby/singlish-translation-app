I just frankly tell them capitalizing on their promotions,btohqsg
But where the funds come from and justifying my income that one abit jialat.. Previously i shared ever since my semi retirement and my illness i have declared close to zero income for income tax n also stopped contributing cpf ever since i hit all the limits,btohqsg
So for those who remember previously i alao asked what to do if they ask to provide documents to review credit limits,btohqsg
I think this is the suspicious part to them bah,btohqsg
Maybe in my appeal i shoudl write in i dont have active income i earn all passive income from honeymoney sg tricks ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Most probably my uob credit cards will be affected soon then...,btohqsg
May I ask u explicitly. Do u abuse the bank cut off timings to earn extra one day interest?,btohqsg
Can only rely on my amex le...,btohqsg
I can no longer justify this kind of credit limit with uob,btohqsg
Yes. I maximize to the max. Their clauses also never say cannot ma,btohqsg
This my friend. Is the reason u kennaAnother common reason is transfer to 3rd party. Different names human,btohqsg
For someone like u who move 250k on a daily basis that is peanuts la ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Just because earn them extra one day interest? So petty? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
If I spend like you  I'll never have such amount in my bank. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
RHB also actively closed those jokers who moved in money at say 10pm then move out at 1129pm or what. Hard ware zone many jokers kenna,btohqsg
Ok i am one of the joker now ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Meaning he transferred exactly on the last day right before the cutoff timing?,btohqsg
Yes i always do that to maximize,btohqsg
Another point is... If your account balance is very little like never go above 10k for the longest time  then suddenly you have a 100k coming in  that might trigger red flag... Vs if you always have 500k all along  then suddenly transfer of even 200k in/out won't trigger anything. U get what I mean?,btohqsg
But right before the cutoff timing got get more meh? Transfer in the morning should be wonâ€™t kena ba,btohqsg
For uob one acct is either 0 or 100k or these two months 150k. No point having 500k or 200k. That is not maximising,btohqsg
Wah ... means you not working previously.. but still have 100 k plus,btohqsg
I semi retire since 5 years ago but before that i earn quite abit la.. If not how to maximize cpf etc before 30 years old? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
This one I don't quite agree. The person maybe strike toto. Then pump $$ into the bank,btohqsg
Yes agree .. every year top up cpf to hit the interest ... but I heard you cannot draw out your cpf lump sum. Sum only little bit 1 to 2k plus every mth,btohqsg
No  it is multiple high transactions in and outflow over different months. You transfer in one time nothing will happen,btohqsg
Ok so they just keep harping on my extreme swing and now blame me for not updating my income documents despite several requests for the last few months.. Imo is just finding something to blame la,btohqsg
Like that if strike toto... must keep the ticket... later the bank don't believe... ask spire pool issue cheque bank in. Then from spore pool cheque should not be an issue,btohqsg
Yea.  Not thinking of touching those money. Just let it earn the max interests,btohqsg
Which part you don't agree? Lol... I'm not saying it's illegal to suddenly have lots of money. I'm saying it may trigger a red flag. When bank ask you to justify the source of the funds  just provide evidence and you should be fine. Only if you can't substantiate your source  then you could get into trouble with the banks.,btohqsg
You top up yourself or purely income,btohqsg
I have been paying max cpf monthly from my company account to myself as salary since 21years old after army. If i remember correctly long time ago was 4500 then 5000 then 5500 then 6000.. Now heard recently they doing little step increase but i no longer do it le..,btohqsg
Figures stated is salary that cpf board cap the cpf contribution at,btohqsg
Chey own business ah? No wonder,btohqsg
Set up the business just to deposit salary nia,btohqsg
Just tell the bank the source of funds is your own business,btohqsg
You say suddenly have 100k come in... that's why I say if strike toto must keep the ticket and photo copy the spore pool cheque. Or else if they ask questions then u can answer,btohqsg
No more le. Close the company ever since dont need to pay salary for cpf contributions. Thats why im semi retired since 5 years ago,btohqsg
Even if you encash a $20 toto ticket  you need to indicate your nric number behind. All these for audit  tracking purposes. For amount larger than 5k  you need to go to their office to collect. You can be sure there will be proper records  documentation.,btohqsg
Hi all. Where can I find the DBS Woman's Card Points breakdown in the DBS banking app/website?,btohqsg
What you have shared over here already sounds suspicious to me... Setting up company to pay max cpf to yourself... Terminate company cos don't need to top up anymore. ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Everyday? Or just every week to earn the free sunday interest? Sorry to ask cos i also do transaction (out) on Sunday...,btohqsg
Many people do it ma. Just need to have a proper accountant to submit the proper documents where salary is paid out properly and company make a loss with the director pumping in cash into the company.,btohqsg
I don't even dare to do the Sunday oneBut let's not feed people with these information  if they do then kena ban,btohqsg
I can understand him  if self employed will be able to understand,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing with us. Do you mean you do everyday for 9 months?,btohqsg
As a moe scholar set up a simple tuition agency is easy. Getting all the required license etc is convenient,btohqsg
Not everyday. Every week. Everyday abit too much hassle,btohqsg
Yup so its to help others to avoid the same pitfall. I dont gain anything from this.,btohqsg
Bro... The more you mention  the more red flags I'm seeing... Company making a loss  director pumping cash in  you receiving max cpf etc... Did your company even have a genuine business? Sounds like a scheme to move money around...,btohqsg
