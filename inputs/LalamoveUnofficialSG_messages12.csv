One hand drive one hand click map,btohqsg
Stop the car and look at the phone lo. Have job then move lo,btohqsg
I noticeThose restaurants u took b4Easy to get the job again,btohqsg
All those restaurants use oddle platform,btohqsg
Idc their ratings one cause no one will rate you for f&b,btohqsg
For the personal one need do swee swee lor,btohqsg
Actually it also depends if they add you as a fan,btohqsg
Sometimes they also blur what fan?,btohqsg
I have a few in Chinatown add me as a fan. Because I do quite often at night.,btohqsg
Ask them rate me 5 stars I also shy liao,btohqsg
Yeah they anyhow click one bro,btohqsg
Not fanMany time i bid can getBugis+Marina link mallAnd Raffles place,btohqsg

Car you park where sia? There is parking but really must be damn heng one.,btohqsg
But the 60 incentive after that got extra $4 per order that‚Äôs fucking worth it leh,btohqsg
Marina Bay link Park b2In out very fast 1,btohqsg
Sibei wuhua but hard to hit,btohqsg
60 orders mean you need hit 8/9 orders everyday during 10-2/ 4-8,btohqsg
Raffles place just park at small laneSo many van parking thereGo in from back dooe,btohqsg
Provided you know where the shop is or Swee Swee no obstacle. Sometime got maintenance work for lift lah or in the mall that you have to do detour. Also coming out from the carpark not every exit can use. They have specific doors. Just like Suntec City.,btohqsg
Lol ya Suntec I park the drop off point hazard light,btohqsg
Go in the office tower then walk in escalator left side,btohqsg
Less than 10 job see no money 1,btohqsg
Less than 10 per day ah?,btohqsg
Only 1 shop book car job,btohqsg

I eat in the car & sometimes no time eat whole day,btohqsg
Bro the penalty not worth it,btohqsg
And sure here cock up there cock up due to the nature of the system & human error,btohqsg
This one I think most peeps who do delivery will also agree. Want to make money is during peak period. You sacrifice your dinner time to earn $$$,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just not worth it to me,btohqsg
Cause all you need is 1 cock up,btohqsg

<LALATIPS>Waiting time chargesDear Heroes A friendly reminder on how our waiting time charges work:Ther merchant has a 10mins grace period to prepare the items. However  for every subsequent 10mins delay  you are entitled to a waiting fee of $2.So for instance  you reach the merchant at 1pm as per order time but they only give you the items at 1:50pm. Between 1pm to 1:10pm  is the grace period. However from 1:10-1:50  40 additional minutes have passed and you are entitled to $8 waiting fee.You are required to inform us through the in app chat immediately so we can verify with Merchants accordingly.Please access the in-app chat by pressing the help button at the top right of the order and inform us in the following format.Order id: 81234-12345Reach at: 1.00pmReceived items at: 1.50pmPlease add waiting time charges  thank you.You may end chat afterwards and you do not have to wait for an agent to reply to you. The waiting time charges will be credited by end of the day.Thank you  drive safe and remember to mask on.,btohqsg
This one from the Lalamove Car WhatsApp group.,btohqsg
What if they pass the item to you at 1.18pm? They exceeded the 10 mins grace period. But we are not allow to charge because it is less than the cap period. Might as we tell us  wait 20mins then the charges kick in,btohqsg
8 mins still can claim for $2. Every 10mins block $2,btohqsg

They will take 16% from every order,btohqsg
That one is cashjob.youalready took the cash then they minus 16 percent from your e wallet,btohqsg
Don't mean to sound dumb. So if the order was to be $15 there will be 16% taken away no matter if its a cash or e wallet?So there should be a deduction of $2.40 (16%). So i will be getting $12.60 cash if not e wallet?,btohqsg
