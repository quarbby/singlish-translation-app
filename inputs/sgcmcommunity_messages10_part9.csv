It already become my habit not to give way to them,btohqsg
Most drivers who saw my car is usually nice la.Only that those very opportunists ones will cut here and there whenever there is a chance to squeeze. And their indicators don't work 100% of the time.,btohqsg
But if they signal  I will give way,btohqsg
Maybe they see car made de lo. LOL.,btohqsg
Same if they signal and come nicely I sure give way  it's those that drive beside you  knowing the lane about to close and force their way in then dulan,btohqsg
They hope u all rear them can claim,btohqsg
Ur car too Low lah they can’t see 😝,btohqsg
Hahahahaha maybe lol. If not they only want other see their car,btohqsg
Told u dun buy Lambo alr,btohqsg
Can’t even afford the coe 1,btohqsg
but but  you are not supposed to be on the fast lane 1 in the first place. 50 year old cannot... 😃,btohqsg
i am curious. how do you maintain a 50 year old car? are you still able to find parts easily?,btohqsg
has anyone of you had license suspended?>,btohqsg
Oil change is easy. Parts still have since there were 23 million classic beetles made from late 40s to '03. Many aftermarket parts support too.But being old  things breaks here and there. Since some part should be original from factory that degraded due to wear and tear.,btohqsg
sounds like my e30. so unloved i got to do it myself,btohqsg
oil change  water pump change  cam cover cleanup. intake etc. few mechanics wants to do. but i kinda enjoy doing it too,btohqsg
as e30 is a cult car  parts are available worldwide. any are die hards,btohqsg
the ony parts not easily available are the body parts - bumpers  wheel arch  front valence etc,btohqsg
but i get asked frequently at tuas customs. they are all curious how such old cars are still drivable... 😃,btohqsg
Mazda getting more premium now. The inside quality is quite European,btohqsg
They need to improve on suspension,btohqsg
And improve more on the insulation,btohqsg
The reason why I bought beetle is that I know there is a specialist workshop only for these air cooled icons.,btohqsg
just renewed my roadtax for e30.  515$ 6 months,btohqsg

Kenna cut lane on lane 1 by a school bus just now  without signalling,btohqsg
Sch bus on lane one ? Highway?,btohqsg
On lane 1 nevermind  cut my lane without signalling,btohqsg
Sch bus that shows vehicle speed limit of 60,btohqsg
You can any car into Malaysia.,btohqsg
Just a curious question  no harm asking😄,btohqsg
Many years ago we drove in a group to Malaysia. Before coming back to Singapore we all stopped in Petronas to refuel. But one guy stood there waiting for us. He didn’t want to refuel abs I asked him why. He said malaysia fuel ain’t clean and contaminated. We all couldn’t stop laughing. Do not let the Malaysians laugh at such behavior that we dare not drive ev to Malaysia. It’s naive thinking. Please consider taking back that question.,btohqsg
While we can remain cautious  becoming overly cautious only makes us look comical and they laugh. Do not be a laughing stock for others.,btohqsg
Actually it's because of knowing where to go when there's a need to repair  that's what would greatly influence me to buy a particular model.,btohqsg
LoL omg...even if didn't spot the sign  the road markings would've looked strange for a lane to right turn!,btohqsg
tesla 3 would look nicer with this kind of display,btohqsg

All the 3D sound come from the vrrooom-vrroom from the YT vids. 😂,btohqsg
Much we we don't like to affect their job  if you feel your safety is affected then pls report to TP. Need them to learn to signal and to not take lane 1,btohqsg
No lah… which is why I did not report,btohqsg
Just surprised to see a sch bus cutting my lane in lane1 without signalling… don’t think there were any passengers in the bus,btohqsg
I have no intention to break his rice bowl,btohqsg
Haha if come to lane 1 but maintain lane 1 speed and come in safely I will close one eye even though they are speeding above their vehicle limit 😂 the worst is those huge commercial vehicles want to overtake another comm veh on lane 2 they think they take off very fast then come to lane 1... Block a good number of cars for some time,btohqsg
