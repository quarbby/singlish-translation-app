I mean gpa not easy maintain,btohqsg

i didn't even ask my class,btohqsg

Rip did PSLE maths suddenly become that difficult? I heard my primary sch only 30 people passed the maths prelim,btohqsg
is it me or do I feel that sec sch math is easier than pri sch math?,btohqsg
idk i scored 21 in sec 2,btohqsg
i scored 9/30 in sec 2,btohqsg
sec 3 i changed teacher my math jumped to a1,btohqsg
HAHAH that's great then it was the cher holding you back,btohqsg
For me it was myself. Took 2 years of not having a single CCA and literally living on campus to improve,btohqsg
sec 1 math I just passed,btohqsg
then sec 2 and 3 A1 and A2,btohqsg
I failed pri sch math btw,btohqsg
my sec 1 to 3 math teacher is the same throughout,btohqsg
altho how come the teacher stay the same for so long HAHAH,btohqsg
My math teacher was the same for three years too,btohqsg
btw I share the same bday as my math cher :),btohqsg
Haha yesEven for Science  I also feel that secondary school Science is easier than primary school Science,btohqsg
Jfc that must be so stressful??,btohqsg
dun really understand giving children who studied their asses off the hardest paper of their lives and making them lose all hope,btohqsg
Yea highest in 1 class was like 50+,btohqsg
I rly feel bad for those kids :/ spend 6 yrs in school only for the paper to be almost undoable,btohqsg
Yea its gotta be damn demoralising  especially since primary sch is just stage 1,btohqsg
how do i like make it full screen,btohqsg
as in i dont know what i accidentally pressed while carrying my laptop but now the border is damn weird,btohqsg
open the game  go to settings  change resolution to 1980x1080,btohqsg
u can change the resolution which changes the window size i think,btohqsg
then just find the most fitting one and expand it,btohqsg
ah ok got it now thanks,btohqsg
Anybody know where a medium sized white board can be purchased at a cheap price,btohqsg
ya! they say its olympiad math standard,btohqsg
Those viral qns are waaaaay easier than olympiad math standard in reality😅😅😅.,btohqsg
I can promise you math olympiad standard ah,btohqsg
Oni smartasses like the kid who took the igcse math paper can do,btohqsg
Im kinda in my own world so idk shit,btohqsg
part a have to use guess and check tho,btohqsg
Bro this just do assumption wot,btohqsg
Guess and check is lower pri style,btohqsg
Assumption is the way to go yo,btohqsg
Because olevel is set by both seab 🤮 and Cambridge .Psle is set onto by seab itself ..,btohqsg
They say now psle maths alot of logic qns like thr Cheryl birthday,btohqsg
Need solve via algebra lel  those kids not familiar with algebra are gone marks,btohqsg
Now imagine if o’s were set by SEAB itself ...,btohqsg
idkk my mom say one ahh...,btohqsg
By right shld know algebra wat,btohqsg
But legit cambridge papers by themselves pretty easy. I sat for one b4,btohqsg
Ok but it doesnt feel like what pri school will need to solve  i think i only encountered something like this in secondary school,btohqsg
Yea when u moderate ur marks with the UK  we all knew it was free A1 lol,btohqsg
Nope i didnt get this throughout my sec sch life,btohqsg
they went for HBL and stuff and they set so hard for them,btohqsg
Set  psle paper such notoriously difficult qn,btohqsg
They want to distribute the number of mental health counsellors across sec sch   jc and pri sch equally,btohqsg
So wat does that mean  you think this should be learnt in pri school?,btohqsg
then last yr P6s all sat for damn easy paper,btohqsg
So gotta make psle more hard,btohqsg
As in this level of difficulty,btohqsg
so all easy As and Bs,btohqsg
papers set before covid tho i think,btohqsg
They want  the next generation ofWhite collar job   blue collar jobs,btohqsg
Which is why this year and last year o’s also may be abit siao,btohqsg
Cannot everyone in Singapore be doctors,btohqsg
I rmb learning in pri sch,btohqsg
Lol idk anyone who wanna be doctor,btohqsg
that early meh? if thats the case then ask them to cancel some qns lor,btohqsg
They want the big 3 people to become doctors and lawyers  Uni ppl to become middle management  Poly ppl to become technician level that kind,btohqsg
somemore this yr no bell curve,btohqsg
qns hardno bell curvenew grading system,btohqsg
There’s no way there’s no bellcurve or moderation,btohqsg
Honestly i was more stressed for psle than Os,btohqsg
I don’t remember studying for psle haha,btohqsg
So you are ok with this set for math pper this year right,btohqsg
i think it’s j the first question that’s difficult,btohqsg
There isnt. Instead the sch adjusts its COP,btohqsg
same here..coz when I was P6 my Math and Sci were shit,btohqsg
At the age of 12 who knows what is goin on,btohqsg
Maybe jus my school :p jkjk,btohqsg
yeah exactly it’s like they expect u to make sm life decisions at,btohqsg
But i think in p6 i legit cant handle the stress,btohqsg
like at 12 if u want to go to good school u need to know for sure at 17 years old u wan go jc,btohqsg
But in sec 4 u q chill,btohqsg
Hear me outThe same people who set these notoriously hard psle paperTheir is legit a piece of cake compared to now,btohqsg
Cuz tbh i picked my own sch throughout,btohqsg
Yea all sch not the same,btohqsg
see those kids crying and begging,btohqsg
i feel damn bad for them too,btohqsg
Hard to say. I think last time q less resources to go around,btohqsg
If you push yourself to go to top sch. But you at the bottom of the sch,btohqsg
Last time they dont even use calculator,btohqsg
In the end cannot go jc also,btohqsg
They are probably the most judgemetal too,btohqsg
Theres no top sch. RI is lousy sch/s,btohqsg
Not according to minsister of foreign affairs,btohqsg
top sch got better connections and resources,btohqsg
neighbourhood sch u only got ahbengs and ahlians,btohqsg
Yea but alot of people say ri good mah,btohqsg
this yr those P6s who kena quarantine yesterday lucky,btohqsg
ri is the best according to me,btohqsg
like if people say oh i’m from [name sch] ppl immediately have better impression,btohqsg
no such thing as top sch rly,btohqsg
most of us here from neighbourhood sch,btohqsg
Same but teachers hit and miss,btohqsg
Cuz normally if teachers stay long in neighbourhood schs,btohqsg
Those are the ones who are really dedicated,btohqsg
yeah i’ve heard abt the express students bullying NA NT students in neighbourhood schools/looking down on them,btohqsg
Unless you get those waiting to retire,btohqsg
thank god this kind of bullying doesn't happen in raffles,btohqsg
Raffles no na nt and express,btohqsg
For my sch we mingle alot,btohqsg
have you went to the school of stfu,btohqsg
Can be hard to differentiate nt na and exp,btohqsg
🤡 but its harder for NA/NT ppl to go uni because you are judged for your intellectual abilities at 12 year old,btohqsg
people should just respect each other’s background,btohqsg
4/5 years u study in an easier stream,btohqsg
their forte might not be in academics,btohqsg
its a culture problem not a problem with the exam paper,btohqsg
like your education doesn’t define you at all,btohqsg
is much better than the ones that criticise them,btohqsg
i mean sch and academics is only one kind of talent,btohqsg
Like NA ppl  4 years study easy stuff then less than 1 year study O level standard,btohqsg
Sec 5 ppl have it harder,btohqsg
Defines what job u can get thou so fuck,btohqsg
i’m not trying to perpetuate anything okay but like it’s not like people from top IP/IB schools shit on express kids,btohqsg
so i don’t see how those express bullies see they have the right,btohqsg
Draw model. There's no need for assumption,btohqsg
but not necessarily a confirm better job if u come from a “better” stream,btohqsg
the reality is being smart is easier for u to succeed in sg,btohqsg
I mean stream doesnt matter jc does not matter but uni course does matter,btohqsg
U have all the scholrships for u,btohqsg
And the personality morals and ethics can fake fake a bit,btohqsg
cos sg is a meritocratic society where success is based on academic achievement,btohqsg
I don’t see why ppl say “grades dont define u” when they are literally obstructing you from doing certain professions/courses,btohqsg
grades don’t define you is very subjective,btohqsg
It doesnt define you but it defines ur career paths,btohqsg
depends what you want to be defined by,btohqsg
if u want to be defined by the job u get and the course you go to,btohqsg
A person’s societal role is heavily influenced by one’s career,btohqsg
if you want to be defined by your personality and how you come off to others,btohqsg
don’t rly wanna say la hahha,btohqsg
but some people have the talent,btohqsg
Eh anyone O’s taking pure phys?,btohqsg
but academic wise is not so good,btohqsg
But getting into ip or raffles or acs or whatever significantly removes obstacles to success compared to without,btohqsg
U can have some guy/girl everyday help uncle cross the road and whatever,btohqsg
Got art schs and sports sch no? May not be the most conventional paths but they are there,btohqsg
