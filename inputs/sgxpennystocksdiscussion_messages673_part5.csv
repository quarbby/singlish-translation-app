Singapore will probably grow 3.8% this year and expand 3% in the next  according to a Bloomberg survey in early June. The government  in May  said that the city-state’s growth will come in at the lower end of its expected 3% to 5% range this year. That same month  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned that the world may face a recession within the next two years.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-04/singapore-sees-no-recession-next-year-as-it-seeks-to-beat-risks,btohqsg
