Hong Kong-Singapore Air Travel Bubble to Start on May 261. Flights under the agreement -- which allows people to travel quarantine free between the financial hubs -- will begin from May 26  said the people  who asked not to be identified as they‚Äôre not authorized to speak publicly. The number of flights will be increased by June 26 if there aren‚Äôt further outbreaks in either city  one of the people said.2. Hong Kong and Singapore have been working on the creation of a travel corridor for months after plans for a November start were shelved due to a virus flareup in the Chinese territory. A plan to announce its revival last week was also canceled at the last minute by the Singapore side  people familiar with the matter said at the time.3. The Hong Kong government said a discussion with Singapore on the re-launch ‚Äúis at an advance stage and the government will make announcement as soon as practicable.‚Äù Singapore‚Äôs transport ministry referred Bloomberg News to its most recent press release on the matter. Singapore last week said the two cities had not fixed a date to announce the resumption of the bubble  but ‚Äúwill do so once we are ready  hopefully very soon.‚Äù4. The Hong Kong-Singapore agreement should unleash a torrent of pent-up demand from people eager to fly overseas and potentially do business in person after more than a year of the pandemic  though it is unclear yet the limited number of flights or seats that will be made available. The desire to travel in any way possible is reflected in the popularity of so-called cruises to nowhere in Singapore and tickets selling out for gimmicky dinners on parked aircraft.5. Under previous travel bubble plans  flights will be operated by Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. The two airlines have been hammered by Covid-19 as they don‚Äôt have domestic markets to compensate for a near-total collapse in international travel. Latest data show Cathay flew just 598 passengers a day on average in March as it operated a skeleton schedule to only 18 destinations. Singapore Airlines‚Äô numbers are also just a tiny fraction of pre-pandemic levels.More here,btohqsg
