Alamak I lost the Esso card. Possible to get a replacement?,btohqsg
dun do. very difficult to claim for the extra mileage. cs will say the cannot contact customer.,btohqsg
Think got surge price one ba. Also motorbike delivery generally should be faster then cars,btohqsg
By right  merchant will check their app and see who is their so called assigned driver. 2nd driver LL have to waste time contact cs. Usually suck thumb wonâ€™t get anything. Usually cs will ask if u got call before going  which is quite stupid when it comes to oddly orders cos always write donâ€™t call. If u are lucky  cs will fight for u  transfer to ops team n hopefully get cancellation fee. I got it on a few occasions,btohqsg
Tie behind your bike n surf to drop off point lah,btohqsg
