From hardwarezone forummm. I find it veri true.I did part time gogo and lala for fun during weekends when i bored and wanna drive around. Surprisingly both also awarded me as star partner due to good ratings and feedbacks.My take is:Gogo1. Good driver/rider partner support  anything call them theu will respond immediately. Customer service friendly and reasonable.2. Base fare quite lowball  have to be smart to plan your route3. Charges higher comms than lala4. Able to take on multiple ordersLala1. They treat driving partner like bangla workers  from the training start the way they speak i already know.2. Comms abit lower than Gogo3. More trips order to choose from  but also disappear at speed of sound.4. Can only take 1 trip at a time.5. Partner support only available using livechat  sometimes can take up to 30mins  anything urgent you are stuck on your own  esp after 10pm they are closed6. Incentives and rewards more towards riders driven  so motorbike s have more advantage.7. Had a personal experience talking to their customer service person  super arrogant and top down approach  customer is always right and u are just a dirt to them  tells u not happy dont do loh  unreasonable.,btohqsg
