i had an auto mx5 before also,btohqsg
It's fun but not enough  now manual it's perfect,btohqsg
In conclusionManual > autoIf u dont like manual  dont driveSignedClement and Roi,btohqsg
manual cars will die off sooner or later... enjoy while u still can,btohqsg
I had one about 9 cars back,btohqsg
About two + year gap iirc,btohqsg
2+ year you change 9 cars,btohqsg
Yes u shld see his ig,btohqsg
Its literally called play with cars,btohqsg
i can only play with my stick,btohqsg
I mean if you enjoy driving,btohqsg
manual is fun until you're stuck in traffic jam üò≠,btohqsg
OMG......ZF 8 speed is the way to go,btohqsg
in traffic jam  what you talking about,btohqsg
Cos coe so expensive then park car,btohqsg
Then i enjoy driving but my car auto,btohqsg
All the enjoyment i had on b road using paddle shifters has been invalidated,btohqsg
yst at CTE  crawling speed of 10km/h until sibei sleepy.. maybe manual can make u more awake,btohqsg
Auto rx8s have their own perks like a slightly longer gap per gear change and the ability to decouple and let engine still operate in 3rd gear at low maybe 10km/h but if having the stick to play with does help with a depth of connection to the car and the drive. Not to mention the ability to do clutch kicks to initiate an oversteer situation easier unlike most auto  unless you 7 dct swap and got the clutch kick button then more power to you,btohqsg
Im just disturbing@Playwithcarsla dont mind me,btohqsg
For me what i miss from a clutch is control over the engine brake,btohqsg
Now is press and no matter what it goes all the way in,btohqsg
We are in a chat called car discussions. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. So no need to act like a butthurt 12yo. When we are grown men. say a manual is the best option for driver's car. I had my good chunk of auto/dct. Hell my porsche is a auto. It serves well as a cruiser.,btohqsg
Nah i am just laughing at you,btohqsg
dont trigger la... everyone got own opinion de,btohqsg
12 yo busy with PSLE la  no time to be triggered,btohqsg
I mean  the same person says ‚Äúenjoy the car my way or else park it‚Äù also says ‚Äúentitled to own opinion‚Äù but it seems some entitlement are larger? üòú,btohqsg
Maybe its just choice of words but when u asked why triggered be careful not to get triggered yourself too üòâ,btohqsg
Talking to clement not u sir,btohqsg
its ok  need go back work le,btohqsg
Nah i park my auto at home,btohqsg
I was just joking with u bro but it seems like our frequency is different. Manual elitism is important part of your identity and I respect that,btohqsg
But just note when u go extreme with ‚Äúif u auto then may as well park‚Äù then return shots can and will be fired üòâEnd of story dont take it too serious,btohqsg
U ask roi lor i always disturb him,btohqsg
Yeah. Only drive once or twice a week. To cruise about.,btohqsg
Relax. I dont take you seriously too haha,btohqsg
Thats why his sally also always parked,btohqsg
Having 2 coe is not a financially viable option for many,btohqsg
Would love to have that as well but just thankful to have one,btohqsg
If a japanese manual sports car can make you drive it daily over a porsche,btohqsg
there was a time I thought manual was the way to go. but after changing to auto  I was expecting to miss it but didn't. and i still do enjoy the drives i have.,btohqsg
I came from an automatic so i cannot really relate,btohqsg
if given a choice  sure i'd have a manual & an auto car for different occasions.,btohqsg
But i can say is  i definitelt have more fun in my manual mx5 than the auto one i used to have,btohqsg
How often you in a jam,btohqsg
if you're talking mx5 to mx5  definitely i'd go for manual. but i changed from swift sport to F30.,btohqsg
I think most car enthusiasts wont disagree manual offer more fun than auto. Where the divide happens is whether u want it for the daily meaning the jams  the mscps and so on,btohqsg
And then u have people with enough money for both and can park the auto,btohqsg
I old alr. I think my left leg cnt keep up the good clutch work.,btohqsg
I get ya'll feel so strongly about manual. But I dont see auto drivers reacting like that. üåö jut saying,btohqsg
