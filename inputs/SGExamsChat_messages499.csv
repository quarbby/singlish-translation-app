Yea even cambrige itself don’t have the Chinese rersources but have every other language,btohqsg
LOL help the SS says a lot abt how old ur phone is,btohqsg
This is not for local papers  so there are some parts that are out of syllabus.Interestingly  the local O level syllabus is getting closer to the overseas one with the latest change.,btohqsg
But it is generally worth to do it after having completed local TYS papers,btohqsg
I see  but the other interesting part is how syllabus at being redone faster than 6 yrs,btohqsg
there is a push by Cambridge throughout its O level Physics to tweak the understanding of energy,btohqsg
Now Cambridge is changing their syllabus about every 4 yrs,btohqsg
MOE is also pushing the use of the LOL diagram for conservation of energy.,btohqsg
So that students can go LOL at it,btohqsg
is that the bar chart thing,btohqsg
need to memorise the 6 different kind of energy stores and the 4 ways in which energy is being transferredThe LOL diagram is MOE and not part of O lvl syllabus,btohqsg
oh yea did they take out cause and effect for english compre?,btohqsg

thn please enlighten me on what you think is something people should flex? other than your body,btohqsg
then here comes your reservist cycles,btohqsg
not coming from rp is a flex,btohqsg
being able to enter a good uni is a flex,btohqsg
being able to secure a good job is a flex,btohqsg
next qn is what’s a good uni,btohqsg
depends on what scale you’re talking and what you’re aiming for,btohqsg
so how does one flex about going to a good Uni.. unless it’s like #1 uni in the world,btohqsg
no im asking what makes you think im flexing the fact that im online alot,btohqsg
i guess we both have diff definitions of flexing,btohqsg
i just give super direct straight to the point answers,btohqsg
when i know a statement is untrue...thats all,btohqsg
to a person who never made it to uji,btohqsg
vs an suss student for eg,btohqsg
but when u compare an nus student to an suss student,btohqsg
and then it goes to oxford vs nus,btohqsg
but regardless being in a top 3 uni gives more confidence that u’ll find a stable good job,btohqsg
ntu nus alr <50 in the world so,btohqsg
i mean like u said ah.. the competition will just go high and higher,btohqsg

No la  last time don't have. Just basic initial = final,btohqsg
this is a new model to teach as side working,btohqsg
it's similar to my own model I created. But mine was mainly text based and this is mainly graphical based.I think graphical based more interesting,btohqsg
can you include rhetorical question in reports or is that informal,btohqsg
dawg i look in O/N chat and wonder how I managed to do those back then,btohqsg

I gave her/him this this this,btohqsg
the most intresting part is that its just a friend,btohqsg
but now he got blocked...so she no longer consider him a friend,btohqsg
the cherry on top is  he saw her father and the father was super kind to him,btohqsg
because they had a plan to transport it without her parents knowing...but something went amiss and the father was right there waiting at home,btohqsg
He also went with another friend to deliver the pc,btohqsg
because the father would think she got a bf,btohqsg
which the father did...hence why he got some free food,btohqsg
if not then dont give pc,btohqsg

bc its the parents who hunting for tutors,btohqsg

Yea RP being project-based  not easy to score,btohqsg
Actually even for project heavy diplomas in other polys also same,btohqsg
Act yi ge interested in the lecturer class  easy get A,btohqsg
goes down to biasness and very subjective,btohqsg
If project-based easy score then you'll never see people kp why they cannot make friends,btohqsg
Coz project-based hardest aspect is the people aspect,btohqsg
one strive for 4.0 the other one 3.0 .. how to tell them ur end goal in mind and ur expectations for the project?,btohqsg

Actually I’m meeting friends but ok,btohqsg
oh haha then shld i ask in the o/n grp,btohqsg
Do u like open book exams?,btohqsg
open book gives them more freedom to set fucked up questions,btohqsg
i mean it can feel more chill prep wise but idk,btohqsg
in one of my graduate mods we had an open book exam that was 2 hours  got extended by 50 mins and we still couldn’t finish,btohqsg
idc… end of the day it’s the Uni/work whos looking at ur grades fuck cares abt the stress u went thru,btohqsg
i’m saying people can like it because it can feel chill to prep for but then they aren’t prepared properly,btohqsg
for me  I think now…. I think… (iw my child to go ri),btohqsg
my friend study 1hr before exam also nvr get so low,btohqsg
honestly..i really felt i just did not treat y1 of poly seriously,btohqsg
but now im treating it more seriously now,btohqsg
that was for sem 1  now in sem 2 its 1.8+,btohqsg
i know i can score if i wanted to  you can see here...I got a B+ for ESE but Got a few D grades for class lessons,btohqsg
but the momment i hand in work late..it greatly affect the grades,btohqsg
need a lot of work some time gotta tank to save ur self,btohqsg
legit need consistent studying and need proper time management skills,btohqsg
I rmb sem 1 for one I grouped with slackers no choice I just do myself and present myself,btohqsg
im best friend with someone who got 3.6-3.8 in y1 in the same course as myself,btohqsg
I didn’t even get any directors list,btohqsg
He does very good notes  finishes his daily assignemnt in 2-4 hrs from the start of lesson...dont do pre-reading...then proceeds to play the rest of the day,btohqsg
he was on the director roll of honours,btohqsg
means confirm got some ppl with 4.0 with distinctions,btohqsg
i once tried to keep up with his pace..i literally could not,btohqsg
when I do my 25 study to 5 min break,btohqsg
He finished his Graded assignment project work within 2 weeks of release...The assignment had a deadline of 4 months,btohqsg
my 5 min break is 1 game of brawl stars or looking after my pets lol,btohqsg
i legit dont know how people study in rp...like what notes do they use to study from,btohqsg
ur sch nvr give notes meh?,btohqsg
rp has no text books...resources are locked until the day of lessons,btohqsg
but they are 2 yrs old...and are student's contributed,btohqsg
just write notes on paper lor....thats what i did also...,btohqsg
no notes make ur own notes...  cannot be poly spoon feed you....,btohqsg
cause in rp...they dont let you see the info you will learn until the very day of lesson,btohqsg
what ever the lecture video say  note down the impt points,btohqsg
what ever teacher teach   write down the impt pts lor,btohqsg
yea im alr doing that...but it gets confusing when the lessons are switched,btohqsg
the problem is...there is a possibility the content learn in eg. Lesson 4  is only taught in lesson 6,btohqsg
for my year...then the original lesson 6 is taught on lesson 2,btohqsg
i did the notes for what i can do alr,btohqsg
actl rn im still firing up,btohqsg
but the rest of the lessons i see are all from seperate programmes,btohqsg
i only study like 2h a day LOL,btohqsg
best part is when the lecturer tells you to do pre-reading,btohqsg
tp admin is a big fucker,btohqsg
i got so much advance info,btohqsg
welcome to rp  btw you know what is the best part of this 4 week module?,btohqsg
everything is released..and all are scorm packages,btohqsg
ah yes a quiz that you have 999 attempts,btohqsg
this module is basically a instant pass,btohqsg
I had the option do bms in rp or che in tp,btohqsg
good thing I read the Reddit posts b4 choosing lmao,btohqsg
maybe..its my school  cause i heard other schools got textbooks,btohqsg
i actually read that as well..but really cant change anything cause my o levels was jialat lol,btohqsg
now the cut off pts for sci courses is quite crazy,btohqsg
my year the drop was quite crazy lmao,btohqsg
no other schools as in rp,btohqsg
cause im in school of infocomn,btohqsg
heard school of applied science has textbook,btohqsg
so humans science thing in nus,btohqsg
Learning in rp is basically studying in a school where information is given and can be used at any time but...all you need to know is how to use it,btohqsg
the momment you have no idea how to use the information given...you are going to fail,btohqsg
A Open book test/exam will never be easier than a Closed book test/exam,btohqsg
i sent to the chat alr u go see lol,btohqsg
even seniors in rp have said some of the exams that are open book usually give questions that are not in the notes,btohqsg
there is always a give or take lmao...you want to graduate 1 yr earlier,btohqsg
then why you telling me to try jc,btohqsg
on the bright side at least failing jc..you can still go to the other 4 polys...failing those poly's you can still come rp,btohqsg
jc is good for those for introverts and don’t give two fuck about people around them.. really needed that but lazy to study more bio crap,btohqsg
i ain’t studying bio no more cuh,btohqsg
udk mehi want my child to go ri,btohqsg
actually you think about it jc is like fine get a 70+ rp still can land u a place in uni.. and also a levels worldwide recognised so like easier to apply overseas ig and also not cumulative so u cld not give a shit for 1 year then buck upthen poly1. u need to give a fuck about people’s feeling if not they dl u then cb now I going holiday in June cfm my project mates gonna hate me for this fuck laaansjckskkfkakdjiak chi self,btohqsg
just join all those cca exco,btohqsg
bro had a breakdown half way,btohqsg
you forgot the students that can fuck over the teacher,btohqsg
no  I am not hating the teacher I need to do well thank you very much,btohqsg
bruh i did not mean it that way,btohqsg
because alot of the teachers are part timers,btohqsg
so they dont give two shit about the results...as a class  you can call for the module chair to relook at results,btohqsg
u should be thinking.. since when pocoyo is intellect,btohqsg
if the class feels like the teacher marked wrongly or the class has scored suspiciously low,btohqsg
so in this sense...you kinda fuck over the teacher,btohqsg
cause essentially you are saying the teacher is not serious,btohqsg
kuro follows me on ig don’t worry,btohqsg
has there been a single good year after 04,btohqsg
jc is the “im gg to throw a table across the room for the lols”the other years are the “we shld remove the death penalty” kind,btohqsg
ok u listen  pw one year or pw 3 years,btohqsg
my course is fucking pw filled,btohqsg
theres a specific reason why he isnt studying a’s right lol,btohqsg
