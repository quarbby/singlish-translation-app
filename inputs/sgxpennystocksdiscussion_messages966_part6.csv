Updates on Amos Group.Weekly chart.Added some earlier  highest at $0.047. Mainly to average into my previous high costs.This counter rough NAV $0.30 based on SI.It‚Äôs true liquidity is much higher  but ultimately up to the BBs .Anyways recently BBs playing the light a super Illiquids of similar price range.Hopefully this one gets the pick by them.OSOD  DYODD.,btohqsg
With Marine/OSV/ Shipping counters doing pretty well  I do hope Amos which is more of a supplier imo  does get its share of the attention.Anyways  now it‚Äôs up to BBs.The last fund raising is a rights issue $0.14 which the controlling shareholder took.DYODD.,btohqsg
