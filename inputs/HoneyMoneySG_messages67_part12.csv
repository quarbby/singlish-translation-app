I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúSupp card uob one bonus‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Wow just noticed for Uob evol card petrol at spc and shell not counted,btohqsg
are you referring to sign up bonuses? fee-paying payall is eligible,btohqsg
Hahaha I almost thought this isna bot reply,btohqsg
Then I realise it's just template :p,btohqsg
Just to clarify  must pay the citipayall transaction fee. The zero fee option doesn't count,btohqsg
oh it was you...ok guys I would trust this DP. Mouse Hunter knows what he/she is doing so if he/she says personally kenna excluded  please don't test it.,btohqsg
Why is that mcc excluded in particular? Just curious. Isn't customer service still retail spend?,btohqsg
I have NO ISSUE topping up NTUC gift card at normal cashier counters.Never buy PAPER VOUCHERS for long time  so i cannot confirm that.I am assuming you are buying for Company D&D or something?Why not you do this to be safe (assuming you have the Discretion Power).Get empty or minimal $10 Gift Cards (yeah pay and maybe get excluded).Then FILL UP the Gift Cards at normal checkout cashiers (this one confirm can get rewards  you want to be safe  buy a mentos or what0.,btohqsg
Dear experts. I use theheymax.aito check for singtel bill. Citi reward card only give 0. 4mpd? Is it true? I remember someone said it will give 10x mpd if we pay via singtel app...,btohqsg
It is outlet/branch specific. Try using $10 to top up first to see your luck in the outlet/branch. If it is not mcc 6540  then you decide want to have 2nd transactions or not.,btohqsg
Can Citi rewards card earns 10x from hawker food stalls and through XNAP?,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúCiti reward Xnap‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
How does the voucher terminal looks like?,btohqsg
likely a standalone isolated terminal that the aunty takes out when u say BUY VOUCHERI would play safe and totally avoid buying at Customer Service counter,btohqsg
Can buy at cashier? Buy at casher is for gift cards only is it? Not physical vouchers?,btohqsg
i only buy gift cards these days..,btohqsg
Exclusion is for both cashback and spending.,btohqsg
no  cos need to pay via applepay/google pay in Xnap app  this is mobile in-app which is excluded from 10x points,btohqsg
Sorry for noob question  how to see what is the MCC after transaction is made?,btohqsg
for dbs/posb card can check mcc via dbs website chatbot. For other banks need to contact the bank ask CSO to check,btohqsg
It won‚Äôt print the mcc code on the Fairprice receipt at the point after payment. If it is mcc 6540  the receipt is very loooong type n just for gift card or top up or physical vouchers. Receipt for groceries is the usual one that you get.If you want to be sure  call CSO..,btohqsg
Need to use amaze to citi-rewards then can xnap  I think,btohqsg
yea  that works if using android phone,btohqsg
Looks like no benefit for Apple user,btohqsg
Apple users can pay for iPhone 2k don't need citi rewards haha too rice alr,btohqsg
Does it work for ocbc titanium?,btohqsg
Or does food not count as shopping,btohqsg

Xnap can be used to scan on all SGQR or only those with the Xnap logo? Sorry for asking this cos i have nvr used xnap before,btohqsg
sgqr with xnap or liquidpay logo only,btohqsg
OK kinda dumb qnsI currently have 3 miles card + 1 cashback card which is uob one (mainly because I use grab a lot + use for my utility payment+ shoppee+ groceries as well)The 3 miles card are1. uob lady solitaire for dining/entertainment kiv travel when I want to but flight tickets/book hotels2. Citi rewards for online spendingAnd3. citi premier miles for overseas spending (yes I know there are cards with better miles earn rate but I like miles that don't expire)Is it worth it to get hsbc revolution for big ticket purchases that dont fulfill the uob one or uob lady criteria? The categories are quite wide and there's no annual fee or minimum spendOr would dbs women's card card be better since there's amaze to pair with?But I barely hit the 1k spending a mth for citi rewards and 2k spending for uob one...,btohqsg
Oh wait dbs women doesn't credit amaze oops,btohqsg
Then I guess its just whether hsbc revolution is worth getting,btohqsg
uob lady (dining category)  hsbc revolution  uob ppv  dbs wwmc  citi cashback  uob evol etc.,btohqsg
if ur citi rewards is mastercard version  can use Amaze+crmc instead assuming the big ticket item is less than $1k?,btohqsg
Yeah hm but above 1k? Hsbc revolution is up to 2k a mth righr,btohqsg
Thinking stuff like 2-3k like new phone  laptops etc,btohqsg
hsbc revolution also $1k per month,btohqsg
uob visa signature for local paywave or overseas spend?,btohqsg
Anyone gotten the shopee vouchers from maribank sign-up? Are they only usable on cashback sellers or universal?,btohqsg
Prefer online spend because I rarely get out of the house on my off days hahaaha,btohqsg
Unless... does uob signature visa work with amaze,btohqsg
Sorry for noob question. For purchases on Shopee  regardless is via Apple Pay / credit card option  will still get the supposed cashback or miles right?,btohqsg
Can miles earned from Uob ppv be converted to cash to offset bills?,btohqsg
Any best mile cards for public transport?,btohqsg
