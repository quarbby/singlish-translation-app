hi  MCPS where will you see it? is itwhen apply for bto there is a box to tick?,btohqsg
Can I ask the difference between first timer & third child scheme? Which is better,btohqsg
Both are separate schemes which can be applied concurrently if I’m not wrong,btohqsg
Morning guys. The final results of BTO is out. 4rm bedok area is 2.0x.So meaning 50% will be disappointed & another 50% will get to choose?,btohqsg
For hougang very crazy. 4.3x. Meaning more than 75% of the applicants will get nothingOnly 25% lucky one get to choose? 😱,btohqsg
Can only apply under one priority scheme only I rmbI apply under MCPS,btohqsg
In the middle of the form page. & they ask u to input ur parents address,btohqsg
Isn’t final results out at 2pm?,btohqsg
Don’t scare me leh. I apply BTO 3 years Liao. 🤣,btohqsg
Yup. But I saw the queue jump from 1366 to 1390 from 2359 to this morning for the project I choose. So relatively safe le ba. Within 2.0x 🥹Lucky I got priority,btohqsg

All the best to all of us. Good luck! 🍀,btohqsg
selection for dec starts in March  I think nobody has any news yet. I have no hopes. 😂,btohqsg
always assume hdb waits till the last day then start. it’s quite normal,btohqsg
current 1 was dated 5pm yesterday,btohqsg
HDB/media cant wait to report the news..lol,btohqsg
Hougang one was crazy. Didn’t expected itLet’s wait 2pm & check 1 last time den 🙏,btohqsg
I don't believe in priority.What's yours is yours. Just pray.I have a child and my sister do not  my sister still get within supply and im out of supplyNext BTO launch then i manage to get a Q within supply. That's 12 person fighting for 1 unit.Anyways depends on luck,btohqsg
And just for info im married with child and my sister is not eben married and applying with her bf,btohqsg

Thx bro. My first time applying for Feb24 BTOUnder MCPS & first timer 🙏,btohqsg
Sorry i already have gone for 2nd appointment and waiting for keys now .Anyways hope u guys got your desired outcome results,btohqsg
I didn’t see it. Single first timer is mcps applicable? I read somewhere on hdb site says it is but on another hdb page say only got ehg. edit: just called hdb. stay near parents not applicable for singles. thats a little disappointing. thanks.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if it’s possible to have a meeting with a hfe officer or something?,btohqsg
Don’t think so. If can  everyone will do so.,btohqsg
Yup mcps = married child priority scheme so not applicable for singles,btohqsg
Hi all  I just spoke with an HDB officer. It seems that when the HFE expires and I resubmit the HFE (assuming I have a significant increment in salary)  the loan amount will still not increase; it will remain the same. However  if I have a poorer financial situation  it will decrease. Can anyone confirm? All along  I thought that when I resubmit my HFE before key collection  the amount would increase given my increased financial income.,btohqsg
This is really weird because by right it seems like the loan amount should be set in stone  which means regardless of increase or decrease it shouldn’t be affected. In any case I think we can just KIV as the HFE system is so new and policies may be refined after. Best to appeal on a case by case basis if needed  or seek MP for help if necessary.,btohqsg
I think the final application rate result will out at 2pm,btohqsg
At the 45 min mark  The HDB officer mentioned that they will review the income but it is to ensure that thebuyers have the financial means to finance the flat purchase and it is NOT for the purpose of giving a higher housing loan.,btohqsg
Lets say if got que number when will our income be assesed? Will it be reasses before key collection again?,btohqsg
Seems like no unless there is a drop in income. They will likely ask you for latest 3-12 months of payslips just before key collection to determine this.,btohqsg
If let say 1year before key collection we stop working and have no income..will they forfeit our booking?,btohqsg
Don’t think so as long as you can pay up the full sum. Meaning if cannot get sufficient loan from HDB  probably need to approach bank. However is CPF OA or cash sufficient to cover all  then should be fine as well,btohqsg
Do check with them  try to email them to get it in writing,btohqsg
I hope they finalise the hdb loan and all during booking time based on our current income. Bcause along the way when the bto complted anything unforseen event can happen,btohqsg
I think my cpf is sufficent to cover the downpayment and monthly loan repayment,btohqsg
Do check w them when you go for flat selection.,btohqsg
I saw le just now. Online. Sad sad. Final updated results. 4rm BTO bedok from 2.0x up to 2.2xMeaning 1 unit. 2.2 ppl fighting for 🥲,btohqsg
