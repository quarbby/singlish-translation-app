Sadly speaking I think there are some people who think having headache = chao keng,btohqsg
This is why we need bedok in here,btohqsg
Then again my family has a history of bad headaches so we kind of understand what having headaches are like,btohqsg
Im the only one hving headaches in my fam:-(,btohqsg
Then again I think this is why I kind of like my colleagues here in my company bah,btohqsg
Because when I told them that I actually went to a headache clinic to check up on my migraines,btohqsg
They are all very empathetic to my situation,btohqsg
Idk am i throwing too high expectations on my parents or what…tbh i would hv gone to seek counselling help earlier if my mum was not brushing me telling her abt my issues away,btohqsg
I think normal bah to think of it that way,btohqsg
But more of like wishing your parents could actually understand your point of view,btohqsg
Like a time off sort of thing? There was once i suddenly felt giddy at work but idk if i shld sound out so i just try to last the day with it,btohqsg
They tell me don't work too hard,btohqsg
Take a break when you have to,btohqsg
I am actually a workaholic when it comes to work,btohqsg
Wah that is nice! There is a clinic near ur office?,btohqsg
The headache clinic is a place I found online,btohqsg
Because back then my girlfriend feels my frequent headache is abnormal,btohqsg
Like is it really called headache clinic?,btohqsg
So he pesters me to see a doctor for my headache,btohqsg
I searched online and there is a headache specialist in Tokyo,btohqsg
My friend actually did MRI but found nth,btohqsg
I see it and it turns out I have migraines,btohqsg
Oh there's nothing as well which is good,btohqsg
I know I have a water bed treatment to relax my muscles,btohqsg
Idk if it is me being dumb but my symptoms feels more like a migraine but then it is not really unilateral,btohqsg
Oh like if u hv chronic migraines  u can take meds regularly to sort of prevent it,btohqsg
Either way to answer your question  yes there is a clinic near my office,btohqsg
My office is like 49th floor  the clinic is 6th floor,btohqsg
For me  one of the main problems is the fact of lacking serotonin,btohqsg
Maybe i shld visit the doctor,btohqsg
wait but arent u in jpn?,btohqsg
I am quite surprised at the fee for my medical treatment,btohqsg
Im a farm graduate but these migraine medicine requires a doctor’s prescription:-(,btohqsg
I am prepared to pay like $1000 for my initial visit to the doctor,btohqsg
Like for consultation only or with treatment,btohqsg
Consultation + treatment + MRI + xray,btohqsg
Wait is that in yen or sgd?,btohqsg
Oh ok that is considered cheap,btohqsg
costs like at least $700 dollars here,btohqsg
Meanwhile when I have earblock during CNY this year,btohqsg
I went to a ear clinic for my earblock because wax accumulation,btohqsg
do u have like cotton buds,btohqsg
And that was like at least 10y ago so imagine the cost now,btohqsg
or u just cannot do it,btohqsg
I wanted to do it in Japan because I know its cheaper,btohqsg
But the earblock is really that bad such that I cannot wait,btohqsg
I saw the picture  the blockage is really that bad,btohqsg
I also can't hear very well,btohqsg
Er if it is impacted  best to not do it urself,btohqsg
I was like walao eh... My angpow money gone,btohqsg
