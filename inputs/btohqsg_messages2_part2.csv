Okie thanks. Looks like I can apply later because my queue was fall out of the cohort.,btohqsg
Ahh I see. All the best!,btohqsg
Ya .... as long as when you bought  your resale flat  you never take cpf housing grant  no need to wait for MOP  can apply for BTO as long as the DPD is on or after the last month of MOP. As HLE application there must be a reason why it was rejected. Just no HLE cannot get HDB loan,btohqsg
Yesterday I called HDB but she didn‚Äôt say about resale grants üßê,btohqsg

Wah Keat Hong n kebun baru select already ?,btohqsg
For tengah parc resident is nov,btohqsg
Toa Payoh Ridge still have available unit?,btohqsg
Or u got queue number de,btohqsg
I just get citizen application approve,btohqsg
Looking for BTO or resales unit,btohqsg
Wait so ur a new citizen,btohqsg
Then I think you need to apply at hdb first for a queue number :),btohqsg
In order to book the flat,btohqsg
Date selected is mean already reserve?,btohqsg
Ya date selected is ppl take liao,btohqsg
Available units is at the main page.. here,btohqsg
"Go down see the table ""estimated available units""",btohqsg
Can we change job after select unit ? Cause I heard there‚Äôs household income up to 80k we we already work more then 1 year ... after we received the grant are we allow to Change job ?,btohqsg
Ur grant is only calculated at the time of ur bto application.the grant amount will nv change,btohqsg
So ur advice is after house selection can change job already ?,btohqsg
Sorry cause nov is my 1st time apply house so I wanna ask house selection then they will tell us what grant we get is it ?,btohqsg
There is only one grant EHG which is calculated 12 mths prior to the time of ur bto application and to be eligible for this one partner have to work at least 12 mths to be eligible.So it does not matter if u change job as long is continuously,btohqsg
U can check how much u can get from this,btohqsg
