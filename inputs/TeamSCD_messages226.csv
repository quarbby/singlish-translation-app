Your words really can trigger people even if you think is a joke,btohqsg
Sometimes if you want to joke don’t use other people seriousness to make your own joke,btohqsg
If we being serious don’t joke,btohqsg
Thru words ofcuz we cannot feel the emotions  that’s where a lot of misunderstanding happens,btohqsg
Unless you deeply know the person example your real life friends or person you played very well with  try to suppress “your jokes” as much as possible,btohqsg
Bc we are still strangers with common interest after all,btohqsg
Giving other people respect is one but having to have a basic minimum of self respect is a must,btohqsg
To me yes you are a funny person to have  but sometimes your words really can trigger people.,btohqsg
you're not ignorant  you're stubbornly ignorant,btohqsg
why else do you think you were banned from alot of other groups,btohqsg
As I have told you  be humble.,btohqsg
Your three words may seems nothing to you  but to others may be an invitation to getting slap,btohqsg
Remember and mind you  most of us are around mid 80s to late 90s people  we still have our traditional mindset somewhere. Please do give yourself some respect,btohqsg
I’d rather you get a big tight slap by me instead of many other strangers. Bc others may not be as kind as me to tell you all this,btohqsg
pls realise you're not in your own la la land bubble where everything you say can be a joke or whatever,btohqsg
