Hi guysI have something to ask y'all regarding job in SingaporeMy plan A is to become a permanent staff in my current company right after my internship  but my supervisor mentioned that there's currently no vacancy to get full timer. So  I'm thinking of plan B in case my plan A failsDo y'all know how/where I can get a job (preferably related to Science practical job) that doesn't need very good English and GPA? My English and GPA are very bad  so I think finding a job may be a bit challenging for me,btohqsg
