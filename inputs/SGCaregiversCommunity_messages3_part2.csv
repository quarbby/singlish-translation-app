Hi all  our loved one (LO) (60) is a brain stem stroke survivor (SS) who is severely disabled/paralysed (hemiplegia on the left side). We do not qualify for any subsidies  thus our only option is private rehab.We are looking to hire an appropriate/suitable physiotherapist to help our LO.We have been trained by the hospitals to do basic PT OT ST rehab exercises  however we are ultimately not formally trained as therapists and we are just doing our best. Thus  we need someone to come in to help us formulate a long term rehab plan to go beyond maintenance rehab or merely countering deconditioning.Do we have anyone else with a similar condition here in this group? We would love to reach out to connect further. Please let me know if you have suitable contacts or recommendations for physiotherapists! Thank you so much!,btohqsg

Hi all  I received a cold call from someone who claims to be from HSBC today.She made a few claims about HSBC and Careshield Life that I would like to check with everyone to see if it’s true.For context  Careshield Life is a disability insurance coverage by CPF (replacing an older scheme called Eldershield) and we are auto-enrolled for it at age 30.1. She claims that HSBC is the main provider for the “Medisave subsidies under Careshield Life”.2. She claims that HSBC have additional schemes whereby we can use our “Medisave subsidies” to increase the payout that we get in the event of disability.3. She clarifies that this is not the same as “Careshield Life Supplements” (private insurers that offer this if you want to increase your payout)  which was what I initially thought she meant. I checked and realised that there are only 3 official private insurers for this supplement  namely Singlife  Income and Great Eastern.I have checked both CPF and HSBC websites but I do not see anything about HSBC being the main provider etc. Unlike CPF Dependent Protection Scheme where it states very clearly that it’s handled by Great Eastern  I can’t find anything about HSBC at all. What she is saying about HSBC having this extra scheme for higher payouts isn’t what I understand from these official sources either.I am wondering if this is a scam because if it is  I almost fell for it.Thank you.,btohqsg
Update:1. I called HSBC to clarify and they said there is no such thing and asked me to ignore and block the person.2. It may just be the case of an unethical insurance agent making very wild claims just to sell policies.Regardless  it’s very upsetting to encounter agents like these. Hope the official councils will do more to regulate agents/bad sales tactics.,btohqsg
Care. There is a lot of impersonation scam these days claiming to be XYZ. If it is unknown number e.g. with +65. Just ignore and block.,btohqsg
