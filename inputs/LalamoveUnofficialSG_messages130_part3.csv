Guys  how to prove that i did not send the item to the wrong unit?,btohqsg
Wah  i 2 years nvr do lalamove only become so jialat now ah?Last time pricing still reasonable but can stack.Now seems like price cui and cannot stack.Worse is under their terms and condition llm got 1 hr to send.They shld really do lalamove express. If dont allow stacking.Anyway to llm as long as drivers keep taking  they will see no point to increase price.Like grab now  during off peak will lowball the pricing.They know pax will book because cheapest.And out of 5 drivers just need 1 to accept can liao,btohqsg
240 gross? I assume u havent minus ur overhead and labour costs,btohqsg
As in 240 is llm net earnings,btohqsg
But If want count as rental,btohqsg
"Hi guys  i have been doing lalamove for awhile. Recently i picked up an order that says pick up now but i was delayed for 26mins to pick up the order as the person told me it wasnt rdy yet. I was expected to deliver on time despite the delay. That dont make sense at all. And i was penalized. I keep asking them questions on why was it so but all they reply was to ask me to fill up a waiting fee form to claim. Its as good as telling me ""fuck you"" in the face. Just to warn drivers out there better not pick up orders that expect u to deliver a strict timing where u cnt meet when they delay you and it was my mistake on my end. Wont be using this platform to deliver anymoreüôèüèº",btohqsg
Shag sia. Order late then become our problem,btohqsg
No wonder LLM so happy to recruit new drivers so many trap waiting  for them...,btohqsg
If person A takes 1.5 hours to complete 6 delivery destinations but got delayed by 26mins at the first destination  how long will person A take to reach the final destination?Lalamove: 1.5 hours,btohqsg
How can we scam someone legallyLalamove:,btohqsg
LLM now simply can't do for cars above I feel,btohqsg
That's why I don't take multistop orders,btohqsg
hmm i came across before but for $1 who want to take sia,btohqsg
That is LLM staff make a mistake which should have $1 + some value but overall not worth it. For 25 locations,btohqsg
Send to Jurong or tuas area worth anot?,btohqsg
depends on pick up location...but good thing is tuas/jurong got a few places that want to go to other parts of SG  so dont have to worry about not many jobs available after delivery,btohqsg

Last time i got it from 7-111 yr ago,btohqsg
Usually i will contact the cs in app and let them know the item is not ready for pick up even though i am there already,btohqsg
Actually Past Few weeks we talking of AVOID PickUp Now or Urgent PickUp as Drivers Most likely will Kena Late. If this kind. ALWAYS take photos of what time you Reach and Inform CS that Stall not Ready as Most of us will Inform CS or you do Stack?,btohqsg
If Stall Say NOT Ready ask how long then Told CS Stall say 30mins Depend. After Which Text Customers say Stalls say 30mins or more as NOT Ready. At least we got proof.,btohqsg
Heng this lala Cs useful if not knn suka suka anyhow admend,btohqsg

A gentle reminder for all bros & sis here just in case you urgently need the money after cash out from llm. Make sure your wallet is not in negative amount or you top up your wallet.Case study: I cash out $400 from llm app on sun night and as usual the money will only credit into my acc on coming wed.So after the cash out my wallet left with only $0.18 cents.Monday I night I do only 2 job and coincidentally both job are paid by cash.So after all the comm deductions my wallet is negative $4.00++Today I open up llm app want to accept job only to realize my cash out failed. llm system revert all my cash out back to my wallet due to wallet in negative amount because I didn‚Äôt top up my wallet.So I lan lan have wait for next week in order to receive my money,btohqsg
Another method is to choose paid by credit job so that your wallet got sufficient amount.,btohqsg
I mean make sure wallet got sufficient amount during the 3 days crediting period before money credit into your acc.,btohqsg
Hi  just joined LLM. May I know the diff between car  courier etc? How do we get the customer to sign on receiving the items? TIA.,btohqsg
Courier means parcel like items. Car can be anything meant for car-load from food  parcel etc.,btohqsg
Once you accept job  press call customer and there is option to call customer or press the arrow for GPS. There will be orange bar that says arrived but do that only when you pick up the items already and need pic as proof.After that  same thing  press call customer to get to GPS and once arrived  press the orange bar and it will prompt confirm drop off? Press yes and it will bring you to take pic for POD or customer sign,btohqsg
I tot got timing to swipe when u arrive and take photo when u pick up. Use that timing to note that u actually arrived but food isn't ready. In such cases also msg llm Cs to get compensation for 20mins wait.,btohqsg
Actually just follow step by step the instructions when u get the job. Throw aside all fear and try  after a few jobs it's 2nd nature liao,btohqsg
Experience it yourself n trial n error is best way to learn,btohqsg
Just double check everytime to make sure your map bring you to the right place. I kanna a few time map bring me to the wrong place,btohqsg
I hope I dare to take my 1st stepü§£,btohqsg
