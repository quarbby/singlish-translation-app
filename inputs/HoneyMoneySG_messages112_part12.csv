I used to follow Aaron since 2021. But now I stopped.. I follow Chris better.,btohqsg
So what was your nick name in Aaronâ€™s chat. Why u change nick name?,btohqsg
I am still Terry . I never change. My friends all called me Terry,btohqsg
But why your username not terry,btohqsg
Where to see it. Not terry,btohqsg
Oh this is my log in ID for telegram,btohqsg
And then ML post things you straight away update here ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
True that. I thought Terry is also in the other chat. Many of us are in both. But he is not. ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
i tried to trace back why he was kicked out too  but i cannot find lol,btohqsg
Yeah so I placed 1 month FD at 5% for now and see whatâ€™s the rate next month while deciding if I wanna move USD to other banks,btohqsg
Yes I saw their short term USD rate is better than CIMB this monthâ€¦ but since itâ€™s cost money to move USD around so Iâ€™ll need to calculate if itâ€™s worth the cost to move to DBS just for a 0.xx higher rate,btohqsg
Hey anyone applied to UOB PRVI recently through SMS ? how long did it take to receive the card? and how long did they take to reach out after you received the confirmation SMS ?,btohqsg
Thank you for the info. The flat US$10 fee is referring to bank TT fee  is this correct?,btohqsg

If booking Australia hotels on Expedia and paying online  does Expedia/ the credit card charge foreign currency conversion fee? Ie can I use just uob ladys card  or should use amaze card?,btohqsg
Expedia specifically doesn't. Just choose sgd when u pay.,btohqsg
Why you like Anh more. You are vietnamese?,btohqsg
If I paid on Expedia with my amaze card  and subsequently cancelled the booking for a full refund  has anyone had any issues getting  the refund via the amaze card  or it is usually no issue? Thanks!,btohqsg
wont have issues  if sgd refund just refund same amountif overseas transaction refund  it will refund to on that day exchange rate,btohqsg
Too many terry  Anh more unique.If you use Anh then easier for us to also identify which post we can trust or skip(Meaning can skip your post easily),btohqsg
Come thrash talk must use unidentifiable names. I go change mine. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I was overseas recently and had a meal charge that was reversed by the restaurant. It took about a day to show up. Although it was paid by Amaze  the refund will be made directly to the credit card that it is paired with. Since this was in a foreign currency  there was a difference of about 3%. I assume this is due to the unfavourable exchange rate on the bank's end.,btohqsg
Not many know if someone stores your contact. Change name to IamNotAnh also can see original name,btohqsg
See the name Anh on a post immediately makes me pay more attention to the post.So if I see it is Terry who posted I am not so excited.,btohqsg
Somehow the name Terry bring trauma to me  for Terry i know,btohqsg

hi gurus! miles noob here.. if i'm planning to spend $15k on SQ flights - which credit card should i best use?also  if i'm booking hotels via agoda - should i be going through heymax (to get the max miles) then pay using amaze cc + linked to my citi rewards? thanks so much!,btohqsg
Travel related purchases are excluded for CRMCâ€™s 4mpd.,btohqsg
Uob KF cc seems best for 15k sgd tix. Or amex krisflyer ascend. Less miles but you can get KF elites gold for 1 year.Agoda booking can be paid via atome. Then use crmc to pay atome and clock 4mpd.,btohqsg
What is the full name for UOB KF card?,btohqsg
One day approval via app for existing cust  get the card within a week,btohqsg
What card do you apply for,btohqsg
He is replying to other on uob privi bro  please see previous message.,btohqsg
Will be cool if they can add more credit cards into their comparison rather than capped at 2 cards,btohqsg
any referral for Atome sign up?,btohqsg
I think first time payment can accept Visa. Perhaps one of the Maybank visa card could help. You might want to Google which one and read T&C carefully,btohqsg
Hi  would like to check for citi rewards Mastercard  if were to pair it with amaze  does it mean I will be able to earn the 4 miles per dollar by using the amaze card for sg public transport and even flight tickets?,btohqsg
Amaze doesnâ€™t change the exclusions not accepted by the cards,btohqsg
I have some questions on IBKR. Recently I sold 2 put credit spreads on stock TSM.When I view my portfolio table I canâ€™t find 1 of the credit put trade despite the transaction showing it was transactedI would like to know how to close it before expiry.,btohqsg
But for example if i put amaze into a digital wallet and use. Still can get 4mpd?,btohqsg
So only using the physical card than 4mpd applies,btohqsg
Can. Thatâ€™s how people with Android use their Amaze+CRMC on Kris+.,btohqsg
Crmc excludes public transport and travel. The rest can pair with amaze to get 4mpd,btohqsg
Hi guys  just checking. does fast transfer SALA work for ocbc 360?,btohqsg
