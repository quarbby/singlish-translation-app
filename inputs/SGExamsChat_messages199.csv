He is trying to stop votes,btohqsg
on tiktok there was this trump supporter who said ‚Äúeven covid chose trump over biden‚Äù üò≥üò≠üëçüíÄ,btohqsg
Imagine trying to block mail voting,btohqsg
Imagine living past the age 3,btohqsg
Imagine switching off the tv n gg to slp,btohqsg
Imagine trying to imagine people imagining,btohqsg
more like imagined  burst into laugher and dies from it,btohqsg
And he actually speaks from his heart,btohqsg
Unlike most of those blue snakes from California,btohqsg
Mad? Inject bleach  maybe it'll help.#HonestyIsTheBestPolicy,btohqsg
He is not overly concerned about sounding politically correct,btohqsg
tink sg alot of trump supporters sia,btohqsg
and trump talked about wanting to fucking his daughter,btohqsg
and cheated on his ex wives,btohqsg
ya lol insta comments esp üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
and he will probably grab you by the pussy,btohqsg
if be had the chance to,btohqsg
tbf to trump that was q a while back,btohqsg
i wld expect trump to have atl abit of character devt,btohqsg
biden becomes president good luck to us economy,btohqsg
At least better than trump handling China,btohqsg
Either way next 4 years will be entertaining,btohqsg
It was already screwed under trump,btohqsg
Yeah agreed  next 4 yrs gonna be entertaining,btohqsg
america presidency season 45 part 2,btohqsg
2020 is such a cursed year lmao,btohqsg
He no longer up ladies like this. Perhaps he has matured thanks to ageing üòÅ,btohqsg
Being harsh on china is something that both parties actually do,btohqsg
Just waiting to see the fiesta,btohqsg
Aka he got caught and does not want further backlash,btohqsg
Next 4 yrs gonna be üíØ,btohqsg
Guys place in your bets for 2025 GE singapore,btohqsg
My bet is pap wins majority,btohqsg
trump was friends with epstein lmao,btohqsg
do u think WP East Coast will win,btohqsg
People actually vote for him lmao,btohqsg
and biden has many connections to,btohqsg
Is he even affected or feels shame about being caught?? Does it affect him? üòÖ,btohqsg
I just want to see the reactions on the other parties face when one of them wins,btohqsg
lmao why are you rooting for him,btohqsg
Couldnt find anything on epstien and biden but clinton and epstein is obvious,btohqsg
Neither. He doesnt do anything anymore out of fear of removal of power,btohqsg
Maybe not. Cos only have youngsters moving to maturing estates while the elderlies remain here. Majority of the senior citizens vote for jessica tan,btohqsg
biden is senile but i rather him than drumpf,btohqsg
Both do iirc but isnt trump more blatant about it,btohqsg
Its the lesser of two evils at this point,btohqsg
just vote the one who will screw up less,btohqsg
imo both will cause murica to die,btohqsg
and as singaporeans unless u r a celeb,btohqsg
yeah as singaporeans we're only spectators,btohqsg
stupid democrats r e f u s e to nominate sanders,btohqsg
How about family members of billionaires/socialites/lee family?,btohqsg
Tell me a person who youd put as president,btohqsg
tbh i foresee china to take over as the main superpower,btohqsg
Kanye. I want to see that,btohqsg
What do yall think of andrew yang,btohqsg
Yeah sanders was such a missed ppp,btohqsg
and their platform is more than vote him out,btohqsg
That's meme dude. He's clearly not fit to be president,btohqsg
better than both of these  but too nerdy to be a politician,btohqsg
Basically both sides want their money,btohqsg
They alr taking that place. Very gradually,btohqsg
China is alr the leading rite now,btohqsg
u think the white ppl will chose him,btohqsg
Yes but u ask who I want  not who is fit to be,btohqsg
that why trump is how he is,btohqsg
Will aoc face the same risk since shes hispanic,btohqsg
We havent encountered a president without a flaw,btohqsg
obama as a black guy become prez alr very big deal  yang has no chance,btohqsg
We learn from a young age everyone has flaws,btohqsg
yeah but as a president he falls short,btohqsg
ok tbh all presidents since clinton sux,btohqsg
To be fair we werent alive long enough to know what they actually did,btohqsg
obama had amazing people skills and social aspects,btohqsg
but the economy wasnt doin so well,btohqsg
Didnt he have a big controversy,btohqsg
üòÇ yea so actually obama is quite normal i think. His style happens to work for america in the past years,btohqsg
Wait wasnt he in some scandal,btohqsg
america cant seem to choose ppl,btohqsg
So you meant since and including,btohqsg
But it sustained? (Did it?) in the social welfare aspect he scored,btohqsg
Who knew having freedom was so hard,btohqsg
fucking china has no democracy but doing way better than america  speaks a lot,btohqsg
Tysm lky no freedom but decent life,btohqsg
we do have freedom to an extent,btohqsg
Haha i have great respect for china‚Äôs leader. Really üòÇ,btohqsg
uless ur overly political life in sg is good,btohqsg
Not a very large one tho,btohqsg
Sg is small and easy to govern but thats not saying he‚Äôs not talented,btohqsg
we cant protest but why wld we when govt does good job,btohqsg
Freedom in terms of protesting on the streets nah,btohqsg
only infringement of our rights is prob 377a,btohqsg
I don't want to end up like Hong Kong,btohqsg
Hk and sg situation is very different,btohqsg
By what time will outcome be out?,btohqsg
HK protestors kena brainwash by western propoganda  become western puppets  forgot their roots,btohqsg
Just to name a few extra,btohqsg
but to confirm is dec 14,btohqsg
R we debating about politics now? I wanna join,btohqsg
idk lol mail in votes gna take awhile to count ig,btohqsg
Or perhaps they do not want to end up in chinese prison for committing a crime in hk,btohqsg
pofma if u really wanna push it,btohqsg
Idk why they hate China so much lmao,btohqsg
and then sekali have faithless voters,btohqsg
Only reason id say pofma is because the ministers decide what is fake news iirc,btohqsg
They can. Thats their freedom. But can it be applied in their homeground? Practicality they forgot,btohqsg
They should leave it to judges,btohqsg
Because their textbooks are filled with idiots like joshua wong,btohqsg
but as a citizen its q hard to kena la,btohqsg
Isnt China basically their sugar mummy thou?,btohqsg
If our enemy really want to take us down,btohqsg
Seems hard but ull never know unril someone kena ‚åöÔ∏è,btohqsg
1. China controls hk police and you have seen what they have done2. National security law3. Extradition law4. Suppression of democracy movements,btohqsg
No matter how big our NS,btohqsg
Still without China  Hong Kong will suffer,btohqsg
Honestly with the size of our military now,btohqsg
democracy is what created the current america,btohqsg
At most can deal w SEA threats,btohqsg
People think either remove or make girls join,btohqsg
sg give us good life we give bck,btohqsg
They nvr think about other ways,btohqsg
Shortern ns and have proper pay,btohqsg
last time they say If indonesia spit at us  we will have flooding,btohqsg
i heard they upping the pay now,btohqsg
Im not talking about a $50 incremeny,btohqsg
democracy is a crap system  most people do not know whats good for them and governing,btohqsg
1) if no police things will become worse2) it was proposed because some dude killed his girlfriend in Taiwan and won't get jail time because there was no extradition law3) their so called democracy is beating up people who don't agree with them,btohqsg
Desire for own power n freedom. It is this desire that drove them. They wont think about the logical advantages etc,btohqsg
To be fair ns is alr shortened,btohqsg
Your 3rd point contradicts yout 1st,btohqsg
Only for PES A and B1 tho,btohqsg
I tink last time 2.5 yrs sia,btohqsg
Hk police are literally doing what you described in point 3,btohqsg
I thought u God of everything,btohqsg
It does not. They beat up people who disagree with them and thus the police must be deployed,btohqsg
Now for point 2   i may be wrong but im pretty sure the law stated that a crime committed in hk the criminal can be extradited to china,btohqsg
The hk police literally beat up protestors,btohqsg
so ure saying that so long as neighbouring countries are the same its fine? And it doesnt infringe on our rights??,btohqsg
and the protestor beats up everyone,btohqsg
Theyre returning what the police gave to them,btohqsg
not more rights la but they r protected,btohqsg
"Now tell me what those ""protestors"" did. That's right burn public property  beat up people. Especially the older generation because they are fine living under the Chinese rule",btohqsg
lol including beating up everyone else? they're insane,btohqsg
Im pretty sure the protestors dont beat up regular people but beat up officers,btohqsg
Expected =/  not infringement of our rights as u said hehe,btohqsg
afaik the wage gap in sg is significantly lesser than other place,btohqsg
Many of them are plain clothes and its eadily proven,btohqsg
^ when i meant sexist also its like towards guys,btohqsg
Men are rarely protected in the law,btohqsg
Might i see some examples of protestors beating up old people,btohqsg
suck it up i always tell myself,btohqsg
But its such attitude that limits change üëÄ,btohqsg
So you cannot excuse that so i assume you also cannot excuse police brutality is that right,btohqsg
Maybe go strt a campaign or smth,btohqsg
But because of wage gap women continue to complain and say law is biased against them. Wage gap is not a law  wage gap is just the corporates are sexist  not the government,btohqsg
but i am honeslty seeing alot of,btohqsg
Didnt they prove that wage gap doesnt exist,btohqsg
Its more of an earning gap,btohqsg
Like women choose lower pay proffessions,btohqsg
in the form of plenty charities,btohqsg
whenever i go on sg chatrooms and there's gender issues its just men whining the shit off abouit women,btohqsg
and you tell me singapore isnt misogynistic,btohqsg
honestly anywhere else is pro male,btohqsg
There is a huge difference between wanting mens rights and dismissing womens rights,btohqsg
and its not even that bad here la,btohqsg
have u ever been on r/singapore or hardwarezone,btohqsg
i think alot ppl got good intent but dk how express,btohqsg
I dont see anyone in this chat saying things like 'women belong in the kitchen' or shit like that,btohqsg
they all bash women super hardcore,btohqsg
I tink r/singapore is nt that bad,btohqsg
r/singapore whenever it comes to gendered issue become r/incel,btohqsg
holy shit its on 99 % of sports pages,btohqsg
I heard hwz is horrendous but i rarely see anyth from r/sg,btohqsg
seriously idk if im in a country subreddit or just fucking trp or r/braincels,btohqsg
i think everyone need to put others first,btohqsg
I like how this chat can be split on biden and trump or hk and china but agree that we need mens rights in sg,btohqsg
I love Singapore being a democracy but the constitution is semi-dictatorship,btohqsg
Shows the good in both sides at least,btohqsg
At least we agree on local issues,btohqsg
sometimes sg is a fking blessing,btohqsg
Any of yall think lgbt gonna be legalised here anytime soon,btohqsg
Even if they repeal 377a the fight doesnt stop there,btohqsg
Y r we talking about politics in exam grp chat though HAHAHHA,btohqsg
just go *ck ur boyf/gf la sg govt dont care,btohqsg
cuz this chat is 90% male,btohqsg
Like if im not wrong they dont recognize gay or les marriages,btohqsg
tbh biden v trump aint a gneder thing,btohqsg
Maybe. Since Pope Francis says it's ok  I think Singapore Catholic Chruch may change their opinion on it too,btohqsg
I keep failing cos of my Authoritarian Left views,btohqsg
Do the catholics have that much impavt in sg,btohqsg
im auth right but i usually write in a center left view,btohqsg
No but the LGBTQ laws are only there to appease the religions,btohqsg
Nah man  pope has hidden agenda legitimately speaking in my opinion. How many lgbt lives can be converted to christianity just because he said yes,btohqsg
Is auth left smtg like far left,btohqsg
didnt say it was  more of a liberal vs white nationalist thing  and you guys aint white so idk why there's people supporting trump,btohqsg
yeah but ig i thought thats whayt u said soz,btohqsg
There's far left  centre left etc,btohqsg
Yea but he said it. If its true then got a chance. Wouldnt it be ironic if a man of god lies in order to selfishly benefit,btohqsg
left right is economic policy  auth lib is social policy i think,btohqsg
So i was a bit confused to hear it as an adjective,btohqsg
someone who is not strictly an author,btohqsg
Democracy run by semi-dictatorship constitution with meritocracy,btohqsg
planning to do that in uni,btohqsg
So thats your ideal state when you say auth left?,btohqsg
I rather not  might get arrested,btohqsg
that why i planning go overseas haha,btohqsg
LOL i just study for fun,btohqsg
Cos my beliefs may sometimes go to the extreme and oppose the singaporean constitution,btohqsg
I thought a lot of wp members actually dh a poli sci deg,btohqsg
im already considered a contrarian  i dont need to study politics to oppose stuff,btohqsg
If u a Communist u get arrested as simple as that,btohqsg
Yeah i rmbr like sylvia has a law deg and nicole media or mass comm forgot,btohqsg
Do they count socialism as communism,btohqsg
i want to ducking die rn,btohqsg
Nope  Singaporeans are smart enough to differentiate the 2. Unlike the dumb whites of usa,btohqsg
Plus the WP is democratic Socialists I believe,btohqsg
So if they legal  then yes. Socialism is legal in Singapore but not communism,btohqsg
And I see myself as a Democratic socialist,btohqsg
Too bad they cant really enact much change yet,btohqsg
They could stir up debates sure,btohqsg
But like hell is pap gonna let a wp proposal through,btohqsg
Even if its a good one,btohqsg
i see myself as a socialist capitalist xd,btohqsg
PAP and WP have def hv some agreements despite mostly arguments I'm certain,btohqsg
But would one side concede to the other?,btohqsg
but its like capitalism but when the govt give welfare and benefits to ppl,btohqsg
I think im just regular left,btohqsg
For now the WP have to concede cos they not enough people in parliament,btohqsg
Some views are hardcore left ig,btohqsg
Oh can wp actually use pfoma too,btohqsg
If im not wrong pofma can only be used by ministers right,btohqsg
btw that site is super biased,btohqsg
I just use that scale as an example,btohqsg
not sure if lib or auth,btohqsg
no wonder i dont like wp,btohqsg
And if u put them tgt plus the constitution of Singapore,btohqsg
my sleep schedule is amazing but good luck for a levels tmr guys,btohqsg
trump gonna be out of the office most likely,btohqsg
what if he pull strings thou,btohqsg
not travelling there any time soon,btohqsg
Hi all how was ur chem üòä,btohqsg
lol america is a disaster  trump win? liberals go to war against their own country  biden win? republicans go to war against their own people too,btohqsg
Hi anyone here ur chem h2 review please,btohqsg
anyone has the h2 chem paper softcopy?,btohqsg
Imagine dems get pres senate and ho,btohqsg
Kim Kardashian will be the best First Lady,btohqsg
Who can I look for to get an ad approve?,btohqsg
My username tells you everything u need to know,btohqsg
But it was ok I guess,btohqsg
Do u hv the question paper?,btohqsg
They collected for some weird reason,btohqsg
I thgt it was j my class but ok,btohqsg
The last qn was would building more roads help the Filipino economy,btohqsg
But no exchange rate so I'm pretty happy since I dont understand,btohqsg
Its the easiest of chapter 6 for me after mncs  considering i dont understand the whole chapter,btohqsg
But u need to write so much,btohqsg
So he used about 20 pages,btohqsg
Is it the 12 page or 16 page one,btohqsg
1st booklet is 12 the next is 4 pages,btohqsg
In prelims i used less than 10,btohqsg
Is it like the geog elect one?,btohqsg
But everyone said the paper was really easy,btohqsg
I dont know how to do any of these,btohqsg
But if i were to choose  2 and 5,btohqsg
I did 3 4 and 5,btohqsg
I forgot the definition so I skipped 2,btohqsg
Wait doesnt every question have definitions,btohqsg
Yea but the rest I sort of remember,btohqsg
Did ur school say it was easy?,btohqsg
My class i guess they did,btohqsg
My teacher said all the qns doable lmao,btohqsg
Afterall theres only 31 ppl who went for the exam,btohqsg
Ohh I tot A level paper,btohqsg
Anyone has answers for the paper,btohqsg
It was like a lot of application like those theory kind of exp don‚Äôt have,btohqsg
now going towards application based. testing u if u know how to apply concepts in a real world situation,btohqsg
so the future students should grasp the concept very well then can apply better,btohqsg
but first must recognize what area is the question asking. if fail to recognize totally  then marks will be lost,btohqsg
They collect because econs is using international version so they need to quarantine the papers,btohqsg
The UK would be taking the paper at a later time than us,btohqsg
But then they‚Äôre using a different version but it‚Äôs still similar,btohqsg
So they want minimise the leakage,btohqsg
But the last one I only wrote about 1 page plus,btohqsg
The moment I saw current account 8 mark question I was like imma skip this,btohqsg
Oh god i wldve gotten 0,btohqsg
I dont understand the entirety of chapter 6,btohqsg
Nvm anyway econs paper since it‚Äôs international it‚Äôs easy to get distinction,btohqsg
Then again i dont know what monopolies are,btohqsg
Not to be a bummer but i got F9 for prelims i must be realistic,btohqsg
Anyway I believe we got option Z,btohqsg
So taking into account the new syllabus I assume A2 is maybe 68%,btohqsg
But to be extra i found out the qns,btohqsg
That‚Äôs damn wasted econs I see it as a free distinction,btohqsg
Last year my sch got 84% distinction and the previous previous year 93%,btohqsg
Legit u should see Cambridge mark scheme it‚Äôs Soo lenient,btohqsg
But i cant generate any of those points,btohqsg
Ah yes way easier than sch,btohqsg
Just say ‚Äúgov spending on education increase skills employment and wages‚Äù,btohqsg
It‚Äôs too lenient and that‚Äôs why I think my sch always have damn high dist rate lol,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I honestly think the whole econs still has less to study than the entire elect geog syllabus itself even with common last topic for geog,btohqsg
Econs honestly feels easier than half humanities subjects,btohqsg
Nvm i cant humanities to save my life,btohqsg
If counter argument they accept such a short answer and maybe a give a short evaluation maybe write 40 words in a concise manner 8 marks alr can get,btohqsg
U intend to go poly or jc?,btohqsg
So i need to count humanities,btohqsg
I intend to go Jc unless if my L1R5 too high,btohqsg
Ssgeog since im single humanities now,btohqsg
Didnt help me much other than more time to study ngl,btohqsg
Oh sad but I think econs can replace humanities for poly,btohqsg
It can somehow be treated as a humans subject for poly only,btohqsg
But my humanities are like C5-6,btohqsg
If econs could be used as humans subject I would‚Äôve thrown away geog and ss long time ago,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry honestly after seeing how lenient the Cambridge mark scheme is u should probably get at least B3,btohqsg
Its bc of that i spend more time on other subjs but econs still turned out worse,btohqsg
Just write nonsense they‚Äôll somehow find ways to award marks,btohqsg
Actl if i did i wldve helped out with the bellcurve,btohqsg
Eh so u dropped the subject after prelims?,btohqsg
Like i attended lessons and all but,btohqsg
Wrote in to my sch to say im not taking,btohqsg
U seriously shouldn‚Äôt the mark scheme is so lenient legit wasted opportunity,btohqsg
In prelims my paper 2 25/90 ü§©,btohqsg
Now a whole 2552 ppl know how shit i am,btohqsg
I bet even if u get some random person taking o level but didn‚Äôt take econs and they anyhow did the paper using common sense can still get at least C5,btohqsg
Ive no idea how it added to 25 tho  seems alot considering every single qn i get <10,btohqsg
U probably would‚Äôve gotten at least B4 if you just kept writing nonsense using common sense in o level with the lenient mark scheme,btohqsg
For prelim I could‚Äôve gotten above 80/90 for paper 2 if I had 5 more mins,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt manage to finish my last qn,btohqsg
But if somehow I screw up for the actual Os and my answers aren‚Äôt accepted I might drop to A2,btohqsg
So ur gonna count econs in ur l1r5 for sure?,btohqsg
Even for geog LORMs I write thirty times as much as the amount of content in this sentence I probably can‚Äôt even get all 8 marks,btohqsg
I didnt do the whole tsunami lorms,btohqsg
Tbh i didnt do the whole q6 for ss too but,btohqsg
I mean in geog need three body paragraphs and all the examples probably need like at least 2 pages to write a good enough essay for 8 marks,btohqsg
Eh so 2 factors is enough for 8 marks?,btohqsg
Walao then my sch lie to me,btohqsg
I think if u compare the 2 factors they ask abt in the qn v well then evaluate with a stand can get 8,btohqsg
My tourism i cant rmb everytg so i smoke lol,btohqsg
Ok but writing a sentence with 9 words  certainly cannot warrant L2/4 lol,btohqsg
In econs 8 mark essay questions just write like the 9 words I stated above get 4 marks alr in some cases,btohqsg
Yay no more geog after sec sch,btohqsg
Actually that‚Äôs probably true since n level they only give one page for their 6 marks lorms,btohqsg
Probably can only get 1 mark haha,btohqsg
So they dont need to evaluate?,btohqsg
So write everything correctly 6 marks,btohqsg
Well good thing I did the n level paper as practice,btohqsg
One of the n level lorms questions was almost exactly the same as one of the tourism o level lorms question,btohqsg
3b is almost exactly the same,btohqsg
My Cher said in the last few years the o level paper uses at least one question that‚Äôs very similar or exactly the same as the n level paper from the same year,btohqsg
cos i nvr study weather HAHAH,btohqsg
So good thing I listened to my Cher advice lol,btohqsg
If not my tourism lorms 0 alr,btohqsg
Tbh i hv no idea what q4 is but i wrote abt ngos  host communities and tour operators,btohqsg
Seab pls have mercy on me,btohqsg
This time i got lazy so i only studied tourism üíÄ,btohqsg
I was telling a lot of people that food lorms wouldn‚Äôt come out but in the end they kiasu still memorise,btohqsg
Good thing I didn‚Äôt waste my time on food,btohqsg
Yeah exactly no food lorms at all,btohqsg
Just rmb vaguely can smoke and do well,btohqsg
Well like I said from2014-2016they tested gateway 3  3 years in a row,btohqsg
Tho the food databased qns were wack,btohqsg
They tested gateway 3 for 2018 and 2019 so this is not the 3rd year yet,btohqsg
So that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt risk,btohqsg
Oh i got that for prelims and its easier,btohqsg
I was thinking benefits and risk,btohqsg
Me not studying weather or what i wrote,btohqsg
I go for the 50/50 ü§©,btohqsg
I almost got a heart attack when I saw the clt for geog cos it said don‚Äôt do the question which starts ‚Äúthe benefits...‚Äù then I thought that question was a PT lorms question and I thought it‚Äôll be canceled and we had to do food lorms,btohqsg
Tbh food gateway 1 lorms wld be easier,btohqsg
They wldve asked abt excess and inadequate consumption,btohqsg
I would rather not that cos I‚Äôve alr memorise so much plate tectonics,btohqsg
Understand some and smoke then can,btohqsg
Libya civil war is the only one i know,btohqsg
Well in the end food gateway 1 didn‚Äôt even need to study,btohqsg
Lmao i cant memorise examples how am i gonna do gp if i go jc,btohqsg
So good thing I barely studied it,btohqsg
Well I guess it would‚Äôve paid off,btohqsg
I knew that the question had to be mostly plate tec and plate tectonics lorms thanks to clt,btohqsg
Anyone pls share me chemistry answer key today‚Äôs h2 exams thanks,btohqsg
Sun moon lake in taiwan  2am  2000 deaths,btohqsg
Anyway I guess once I go JC I can say goodbye to easy econs paper,btohqsg
Its example for why time of occurrence affects the extent of earthquake,btohqsg
Jc got no mcq and the mark scheme is much harder to get marks,btohqsg
Lol but u wld hv an advantage since ur olevel econs is good,btohqsg
The tb gave sun moon lake tho,btohqsg
I want to see if it‚Äôs possible to start studying H2 over the hols and then see if I can take a level early in J1,btohqsg
But might be a bad idea,btohqsg
Well anyway some A level concepts my teacher gone through in class,btohqsg
So I sort of know o level stuff and more,btohqsg
And I want to take full advantage of what I‚Äôve learnt,btohqsg
The teacher judges him for it,btohqsg
Listens to econs podcast every night and repeats it during recess,btohqsg
Dont u listen to econs podcast,btohqsg
I stopped a while ago alr,btohqsg
He says he might not get A1 lmao,btohqsg
If he gets A2  I get D7,btohqsg
But anyway o level econs doesn‚Äôt need ppl to study like me just bs and probably can get A2,btohqsg
Like the mark scheme is so lenient even people who get F9 for prelim they improve to at least B3,btohqsg
@chemcer  this is you @ geography lel.,btohqsg
Well I feel sorry u wasted the opportunity lol,btohqsg
If i get E8 its on my cert,btohqsg
If i get F9 its not,btohqsg
If i dont do the exam its not,btohqsg
Dont listen to him yupi  he is the type of get A1 and says he will only get B4,btohqsg
And i benefitted frm more time for 6 subjects (7 but chinese was in june),btohqsg
Like even my teacher said last year there were 2 students always skip school and barley studied at all they still got C5 somehow,btohqsg
Yeah then u say u would get L1R5 54 when ur prelims L1R5 is like 8,btohqsg
Tbh i did my calcs and in the best case scenario my l1r4 18,btohqsg
For me is like 11 I think,btohqsg
For me is less than 54,btohqsg
But wtv i dont care liao,btohqsg
Oh sorry I mean 11 L1R5 raw score,btohqsg
Tho i need l1r5 <20 for courses i like,btohqsg
But I estimate should in actual fact be about 12/13,btohqsg
I think I got only 19/30,btohqsg
lmao rhe lc last part is hard,btohqsg
I heard some of the stuff wrongly and there was this annoying fan in my classroom that made a high pitched sound  ask the Cher to turn it off but they did nothing,btohqsg
I think that annoying fan cost me one or two marks,btohqsg
Its called having a sense of humour,btohqsg
There was one of word I heard ‚Äúthe study can help us solve our problems‚Äù instead of ‚Äúsolve animals problems‚Äù,btohqsg
I feel like going to KDK to spam bad reviews for their lousy noisy fans,btohqsg
You'll do well  you tried your best already,btohqsg
Same but I'm so confident that I'll win that it doesnt matter,btohqsg
Idk I'm still deciding between jc or poly,btohqsg
I think my sch no budget so they cannot afford to repair,btohqsg

He thinks we cant make it to jc :(,btohqsg
if you want hands-on go for polyif u wanna study go jc,btohqsg
I feel like I might go to jc but after J1 I start hating it and drop to poly,btohqsg
Tbh these 2 r most common plus u hv econs so id guess u will go business,btohqsg
I alr know i'll die there,btohqsg
But I scared if I go jc  hard to make it into uni,btohqsg
And poly costs so much more,btohqsg
I mean poly also stress but,btohqsg
Maybe let's call JC work playing,btohqsg
jc have higher chance to go uni,btohqsg
Shhh dont remind me of how broketh i am,btohqsg
honestly uni doesnt mean success in life la,btohqsg
Plus the Jump in difficulty is big,btohqsg
all routes leads to rome eventually,btohqsg
just enjoy the process and make it a good one,btohqsg
I no money buy plane tickets to Italy,btohqsg
But not sure if the extra stress does not outweigh the benefits,btohqsg
depends on how you see it imo,btohqsg
