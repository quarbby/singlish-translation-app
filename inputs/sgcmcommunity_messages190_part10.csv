"The General Insurance Association has launched a new service that allows car owners to purchase accident reports online for their cars in the past six years.The General Insurance Association of Singapore (GIA) launched a new online service on Wednesday (February 21)  allowing car owners to purchase accident reports for their cars over the past six years.This means that someone looking to buy a used car can ask the owner to purchase and produce a report to better understand how many accidents the car has been involved in over the past six years.Ho Qirong  chief executive of the General Insurance Association of Singapore  said  ""This is the first time that car owners can view the accident report of their car. After the launch of the new service  both sellers and buyers can conduct transactions more intelligently.""Each report is priced at $90 (including gst).",btohqsg
For a layman info sounds very biased lol,btohqsg
Car model population size (vezel  altis  other popular daily cars) demographic of driver (like civic fd  lancer  scirocco),btohqsg
its not a good representation of safety of the car,btohqsg
Isn't it the report for that one particular car,btohqsg
so its just for that particular unit?,btohqsg
if that one isnt it enough to just google the license plate see whether come out on sg road vigilante before,btohqsg
That is what I understand from the statement  cause why would I pay $90 for the general record of accident of my car brand. I think more for that one car history,btohqsg
yea i was reading from this chat 2 diff story so was confused,btohqsg
If the car got captured in sg vigilante then ok  I think is more for those minor accident where the previous buyer got claim from insurances,btohqsg
Then theres also the load of small little carpark accidents that go unrecorded,btohqsg

This means that someone looking to buy a used car can ask the owner to purchase and produce a report to better understand how many accidents the car has been involved in over the past six years.,btohqsg
I suppose you have to get the current owner to buy on your behalf,btohqsg
Some may not even be reported,btohqsg
By right claim or no claim  supposed to report,btohqsg
Yea from my understanding  since the ones worth claiming would have to be significant which also may have been reported online publicly like sh road vigilante anyway,btohqsg
So why would i pay $90 when i can google search and find a good amt of those reports anyway,btohqsg
Wonder if seller would spend the money,btohqsg
But they can always include it in the car price,btohqsg
So I guess more useful if direct seller,btohqsg
Probably not. Thats why direct buyer would have to ask the direct seller to purchase,btohqsg
I assume the direct buyer would have to reimburse,btohqsg
I dont see why the direct seller would be reluctant to do so if they are very sure there are not accident claims ... buyer willing to pay the $90,btohqsg
Pls read the 'disclaimer' and FAQ. Frankly  it doesn't cover 100%. Nothing was mentioned who are the 3rd party organisation that GIA is gathering the info.,btohqsg
Yah for the unit you wanna buy  like a ppi,btohqsg
Doesnt cover but any major ones would mostly be covered i guess. Esp those that are claiming insurance for the repairs,btohqsg
Yah given the high risk of dubious background for a car  if come back clean sheet then more compelling to buy,btohqsg
That money i‚Äôd rather just pay for PPI and see what they can dig up from the car condition be it engine or body panels like gaps / paint uneven etc,btohqsg
Not a replacement but more of a complement,btohqsg
Back to near pre motorshow level,btohqsg
Yeahhh. If direct seller die die dont want to purchase even with your reimbursement  its a red flag,btohqsg
Yah  to see if there's any signs of major repair that wasn't reported,btohqsg
