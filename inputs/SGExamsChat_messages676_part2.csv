Hahahaha....yijc only had 1. It was definitely not me.,btohqsg

But my picture not on the library wall anyways so hahahahha,btohqsg
Clearly they did not like 78 pointers,btohqsg
nvm your pic can be on the faculty lift wall,btohqsg
so much better than i did,btohqsg
like that's not even a joke,btohqsg
didnt they use to hang like students picture in the atrium before like a banner,btohqsg
they did  but im not sure if even si yan is old enough to have seen it before yet,btohqsg
Is 78 points considered like the top 10% in yi,btohqsg
I have to be honest. Sadly yes.,btohqsg
How many people can enter the big 3,btohqsg
tbh it's not rlly the JC's fault for the COP,btohqsg
I feel like COP is an indicator for the popularity of the school,btohqsg
it depends on the R5 of those who want to go there,btohqsg
Like it doesn’t define the quality,btohqsg
cop is decided by the students not by moe or the school,btohqsg
In a group of 800 matriculated students in J1  400 got promotion status  200 advanced.,btohqsg
lower cop = more popular jc,btohqsg
COP is also not very reliable lol,btohqsg
I’ve heard people say some YI materials better than cjc in terms of science,btohqsg
But if u look at the COP,btohqsg
tbh i've heard more positive things abt YI sci than CJ sci lmao,btohqsg
I heard CJ bio is legit,btohqsg
I saw the vantage tutor guy on tiktok,btohqsg
Yi econs is legit down the drain,btohqsg
He say he prefer yi materials,btohqsg
YI computing is also better than JP computing i heard,btohqsg
@habibi5201Should I change subj combi to CMEg because of my classmate  fail A Levels  sign on and retake as CFMe?,btohqsg
Bro does lecture notes really matter? Why don’t people just use holy grail,btohqsg
The rest are ok  just not yi econs,btohqsg
I will then go to MI to have a higher chance of entering local uni,btohqsg
My Cher say he’s been preparing something for very long,btohqsg
He also new cher I think,btohqsg
"I don't know a short answer like ""the GDP growth increase"" has marks.",btohqsg
idk but my sis might know lol considering she was in ntu in like 2012,btohqsg
its +1 year of A levels and our average is still the same as YI or even worse,btohqsg
this year there was one person from MI who got 90RP,btohqsg
changing subject combi for someone else is unwise lol,btohqsg
H2 might be more CB abt the phrasing,btohqsg
Yeah but it's only 6/month and higher chance of going local uni,btohqsg
Like the links must be more elab on,btohqsg
Gg then I take h1 Econs in yi,btohqsg
yeah i guess they took it off before you matriculated,btohqsg
But I heard it’s more content heavy,btohqsg
nah im shitposting and see who will take it seriously,btohqsg
isnt the chance of local uni just dependent on yourself,btohqsg
you could go to hci but if you dont study you still cant make it to local uni,btohqsg
the 6/month and local uni is a running joke,btohqsg
But then they say yi Econs bad,btohqsg
