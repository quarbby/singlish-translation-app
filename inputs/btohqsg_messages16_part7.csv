I‚Äôm still a full time uni student while my partner is in NS but gonna ORD in Seo,btohqsg
By the time u working full time there will be whole line of people wanting to offer u loans.,btohqsg
But then how about during downpayments?,btohqsg
Before your flat selection appt you need to apply for HLE (hdb loan eligibility letter).. you will need your payslips to apply.. as for full time uni students or ns ppl im not too sure,btohqsg
CPF housing grant recipientsYou have to pay at least 5% of the purchase price using your CPF OA savings and/ or cash when the CPF housing grant that you qualify for exceeds 95% of the purchase price of the flat. Excess housing grant amount (if any) can be used to pay for any Optional Component Scheme items and the price premiums that single applicants and Singapore Citizen/ Singapore Permanent Resident households have to pay  before it is credited into your CPF Special/ Retirement and Medisave accounts.,btohqsg
Means die die u need 5% in cash or cpf,btohqsg
If u can't even afford this means u not ready.,btohqsg
I shall just work more shifts firstüòÇ,btohqsg
OR u trying for flat too expensive for your budget.,btohqsg
is ur partner going to continue study after ns?,btohqsg
U save more until he worked good job at least 6 mths,btohqsg
Otherwise have to count on parents for the 5%,btohqsg
Last time I borrowed from several banks credit to make up down payment but I had stable job and confident. Don't try if not confident....,btohqsg
Yes looking potentially at maybe the may serangoon,btohqsg
Cause within 4km from my partner parents house also so thought got proximity grant,btohqsg
Proximity grant doesn't apply to BTO isn't it,btohqsg
No proximity grants for bto  thats for resale,btohqsg
The benefit of proximity for bto is qualifying for MCPS,btohqsg
Doesnt  just an extra ballot chance instead,btohqsg
For the sake and clarity of helping you understand and also to clear any doubts:1. You are a student and your partner is in NS - You are automatically under Deferred Income Assessment (DIA). This is because as of flat application time  neither of you have worked for in full-time employment at least 12 months hence  HDB/Bank are unable to assess your income hence they are not willing to extend you any loans. Now as you are under DIA  the HLE and Enhanced Housing Grant (EHG) will only be assessed nearer to the key collection time (4-6 years from now).2. What you need to pay in the near future:First Appointment aka Flat selection date (a few months after you ballot for the BTO): Option fee during your flat selection (Can range from $500-$2k depending on the house type you choose during your flat application).Second Appointment aka Downpayment date (6-9 months after Flat Selection): Downpayment (5% of the unit price)  Buyer Stamp Duty (Can be calculated here:https://mytax.iras.gov.sg/ESVWeb/default.aspx?target=MSDCalculatorSelection)  HDB Conveyancing Fees (Can be calculated here:https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BB14LFEESENQ/BB14PHomePage.jsp)So what you need to do is:1. Budget well taking all these factors into account. If CPF not enough to cover  you need to pay in cash. As long as you can cough up the money HDB won't reject your ballot.2. Think long and hard about your r/s as this is a big commitment  probably the biggest purchase in your foreseeable next few decades.3. If you think not enough money now  earn first then eventually try for BTO down the road or SBF or resale. This is timeline dependent  meaning how urgent you need the housing.,btohqsg
