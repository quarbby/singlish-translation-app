i never did any webull before..but i tot there was an option to do the SGD version (or was that a past promo).,btohqsg
WeBull CSO said the promo was only for USD so I exchanged sgd to usd,btohqsg
And I read the T&C again which states that sgd is also applicable.... they shared that their cso gave the wrong info and compensated me with 200usd,btohqsg
Even with the compensation+ daily interest+ 3% special bonus  I'm still at a capital loss,btohqsg
yeah must read the TNC and understand the risks when doing lohi myself also kenna from SNACK.. just to get $80 capita vouchers.. i bought $4k of SNACK.. now down $200,btohqsg
Sharing the incorrect info by WeBull CSO  horrible horrible horrible!,btohqsg
actually did u try asking for more than USD200 compensation?,btohqsg
Minimally to cover the FX commission rate both ways,btohqsg
if you can prove that you intended to put into SGD  but were misled into putting USD  i think you have a case,btohqsg
Yes  as shared in the screenshot. And I put in almost the MAX amount to take advantage of the promotion (got greedy)  so my capital loss is quite substantial. Haiss....,btohqsg
Wah there is such nonsense one ah? 🤣,btohqsg
"If I use my DBS credit card to bill payment another credit card  I know it does not earn rewards. Does it count towards annual fee waiver?Meta AI seems to think soWhen using your DBS Vantage Credit Card to pay another credit card bill  the transaction is considered a ""Funds Transfer"" or ""Payment to Another Card"". In this case:- The transaction amount WILL count towards the annual fee waiver spend requirement.DBS Bank typically requires a minimum spend amount (e.g.  SGD 25 000) within a specified period (e.g.  12 months) to qualify for an annual fee waiver. Since funds transfers or payments to other credit cards are included in the total spend amount  using your DBS Vantage Credit Card for such transactions can help you meet the spend requirement and potentially waive the annual fee.Please note that terms and conditions may change  so it's always best to confirm with DBS Bank directly or check your credit card agreement for the most up-to-date information.",btohqsg

Why would you trust meta AI?,btohqsg
It’s more of I googled and couldn’t find a proper answer so at least this AI give me a basis to work on. Hoping the experts here can help.,btohqsg
Don't think it will contribute to AF waiver,btohqsg
Doubt it will count but DBS typically easy to waive as long you use the card often. Can always go cancel card route. 🤪,btohqsg
I’ve checked with UOB CSO  they say this month got delay in crediting of the UNI$,btohqsg
I suggest you guys to check with uob chatbot why you uni$ got delayed if you don’t get your bonus uni$ by now. I haven’t received my bonus category uni$. I contacted uob chatbot  it turned out they changed my bonus category 🤡,btohqsg
They mentioned that it will be credited this few days. I will monitor first  otherwise I’ll call them again,btohqsg
What was the reason provided by them? How come out of the blue will change customers' category?,btohqsg
They said I requested an update in the mid of the quarter … but I don’t rmb I did. Then I requested to update back  the cs rejected me saying the current quarter bonus category can’t be updated . Kinda self-contradictory,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone knows any september promos for savings account? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Can somebody advise? I applied for a SCB Smart credit card supplementary card for my wife to use public transport and the card arrived today bearing the same card number as mine.Does this mean that we cannot both tap the card when taking public transport? Anybody has experience on this?,btohqsg
SCB have always been the same card number for main and supAs for the public transport  good question I believe both can use but can wait for someone who has experience to comment,btohqsg
Which part of snack TNC was misleading or is it better I search your old messages?,btohqsg
I never said I was misled.I said I losing more than the benefit.,btohqsg
Hi Casey  is supp card spending tracked separately or they appear on the main card account?,btohqsg
Don't say that.. you are not greedy and it's normal to want to maximise returns.Can understand how you feel. My experience is with moomoo where different CSO can give different answers..,btohqsg
Scb shows both main and supp card spending together. Quite stupid actually.,btohqsg
I've cancelled my sup cards as there is a weird situation where you can't do credit limit review online if you have sup cards. They need sup card holder to acknowledge and signBut for online transaction it actually will ask you otp to send to which  main or sup,btohqsg
Thanks very much for the replies Casey and MT. I really suspect cannot both use at the same time because how will SimplyGo track it if it ties to the same unique card number?Nonetheless  I will try to call CS tomorrow to find out for sure. Hope they don’t give me wrong answer 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Hi credit card gurus  I have an upcoming rental lease of 2 years of $2800 monthly so of course I want to maximise what I can with CardUp.I am intending to pay the first $2000 with Maybank platinum visa to get some cashback  but no idea about the next $800  any advise on the cards that I should get? Or a different breakdown of payment with different cards? Not very familiar with miles cards but open to options  all comments are welcomed!,btohqsg
It just a risk to be taken. If market go up. Also will your benefit more.,btohqsg
Is mcc 5047 online purchase excluded for 4mpd with uob ppv? I don't see this mcc in the mcc exclusion list for ppv. Heymax also recommend use of ppv for places with mcc 5047. I can't seem to find any concrete dp. Thank you 🙏,btohqsg
is it in the online inclusion list for ppv?,btohqsg
Trying to find a card that can get rewards on 5047 but not very successful so far,btohqsg
How are you paying for that? Can paywave then use UOB ppv or vs if more than 1k,btohqsg
Online payment. Pay on a browser. How about dbsww? Not in their exclusion list. Can't rmb which card uses white list which uses black list,btohqsg

If same card number then SimplyGo track as same card. One way to circumvent is don't ever use the physical card to tap. Use Google/Samsung/Apple Pay  SimplyGo track as different card due to different virtual card numbers.,btohqsg
