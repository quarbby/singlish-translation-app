Cos now uob one I see the cashbacj come in only 3 month. Then like little.. uob evol like better,btohqsg
hi all  if my cpf account has not meet the FRS and BHS. should I top up MA account by this month or top up in December? use the $8000 to earn some interest in high yield saving account first?,btohqsg
They nerfed Evo starting from aug,btohqsg
Oh then I shdnt apply‚Ä¶ I go read up,btohqsg
Ya lo   I also just applied last mth . Unfortunately  only can enjoy the 8% rebate for another 1-2 mth with min spend of $600,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I am planning to have a big purchase overseas (~10k sgd single transaction).Considering the nerf to amaze  is the best option still citi rewards + amaze?,btohqsg
honestly no‚Ä¶ cause the 4mpd for crmc is only for the first $1k spending per calendar month,btohqsg
may I ask on your recommendation what would be the best option in my situation?,btohqsg
Anyone ever gotten their uob account closed by uob? What are the chances for appeal?,btohqsg
What is the mcc code? Which merchant? Payment method?,btohqsg
usually account closure wont be sudden  they probably send you an email regarding this before and depending on that email content  you might know why its close. otherwise contact CSO,btohqsg
Maybank horizon and vi have promo in jun for foreign currency promo,btohqsg
Amaze + UOB KF. If it is foreign currency  Amaze is still the best.The rest of pop-up credit card fx promo may have first xxx card holders only. U may have to explore.,btohqsg
Hi all. Would like to know which miles credit card is best for Apple app purchases under MCC 5818?I think UOB PRVI is eligible.Thanks,btohqsg
if its MCC 5818  i think crmc is better at 4mpd,btohqsg
Hi all  is there anyway to avoid the 3% charge fee for spending above rmb200 when linking sg credit card to Alipay and spend in China?,btohqsg
That sounds crazy if you include the 3.25% fx fee ü§Ø,btohqsg
Not sure link YouTrip or trust card is feasible toward Alipay,btohqsg
Suggest search chat history ‚ÄúCRMC Apple‚Äù,btohqsg
Are shopback pay in-store transactions counted as online transactions for citi smrt card?,btohqsg
?? I‚Äôm not the one asking the question,btohqsg
Maybe can try link Amaze to alipay? Don't forget to link card to Amaze too,btohqsg
Have prerequitise for uob kf. Sia spending of 800 in the card year,btohqsg
Other payment method should be ok. Apple Pay/mobile wallet in apps may need to double check. Pls refer to clause 1.h in TnC.,btohqsg
6.67%* but from Aug it's 3.75%-3.9%.,btohqsg
4mpd for 1k in statement month  not calendar month,btohqsg
Depends on your goal. One factor you can think of is if your HYSA interest % is higher than your income tax % + SA/MA interest % combined.Put in CPF cannot come out  but you get to accumulate CPF faster with good rates and enjoy tax relief.Keep in HYSA you have liquidity.,btohqsg
I will still top up by end of the year to deduct income tax. just wanted to know whether any difference if I top up now vs I top up later in December?,btohqsg
so if I top up now directly  the cpf interest will start accumulating?,btohqsg
Top-up this month  it starts accumulating in Jul. Top-up in Dec  it starts accumulating in Jan.,btohqsg
Eg if apply in July 24. Card year mean July 24 - Jun 25 right?,btohqsg
Should be the issue month but best to check with cso,btohqsg
For citi and amaze  if I make paywave transaction via Google pay (andriod) do I still get the full rewards?,btohqsg
if u meant using Amaze (linked to crmc) on googlepay  will get 10x points so long mcc is not excluded.,btohqsg
Hey  anyone knows how can we check how much reward points do we have for SC smart card and journey? I understand the reward points are not pooled together but i can‚Äôt seem to check how much are there for each cards.,btohqsg
hi can i just confirm that bus/mrt fare  foodcourt/restaurant bills are counted as a qualifying spend for singsaver‚Äôs promotion?,btohqsg
See the card tnc  seem mostly eligible,btohqsg
Which card you are applying? HSBC revo?,btohqsg
Want to check please  I was looking at Koufu‚Äôs MCC which is 5814  heymax says CRMC will award 0.4MPD but dobin says 4MPD instead.Which is accurate ah?,btohqsg
Hi Syyy - this is Khaled from Dobin  did you select In-Store or Online purchase? You can specify by clicking on edit on the top widget,btohqsg
You are the second person I heard of here. I don‚Äôt think the first person appeal succeeded but it was due to not satisfying Uob demand for income documentation.,btohqsg
Hi I have a very noob question. I am in SG now  and I'm going to make a transaction of more than 3000 euros with CC to my supplier in France. Will this transaction be considered an oversea spent or a local one?,btohqsg
Foreign currency spend. Some cards need spending to be done physically overseas  some can do online  some need to be processed by overseas payment portal...,btohqsg
Hey guys  is citi smrt card spending on atome consider online spend?,btohqsg
Is it not possible to add more than one cards owned to Dobin  can‚Äôt see to find that option in the app,btohqsg
Not only on Kris+  normal use with googlepay and paywave can also earn 4mpd right,btohqsg
get 4mpd for max 1k spending in statement month so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
