and 3d printed a FGC 9,btohqsg
Usually if the police handle u for explosive u still in the small leagues,btohqsg
inb4 potato guns are illegals in singapore,btohqsg
That's when u know u gg,btohqsg
yes he got arrested with a charge for that,btohqsg
fella tio remand and 10k bail sial,btohqsg
Tbvh I am still not a hardcore fan of fireworks,btohqsg
Fireworks are still allowed not firecrackers,btohqsg
Firecracker are allowed only by permission from STB,btohqsg
Which is why I kinda hated the fact that SG decided to put fireworks at EVERY. EFFING. DISTRICT. in Singapore during NDP,btohqsg
Well fireworks pose a threat to planes too if not set off properly,btohqsg
"They were like ""we are doing it in 2020 cus everyone in covid""",btohqsg
"Then suddenly they said ""oh we doing in 2021 and onwards cus everyone likes""",btohqsg
Fireworks are just a primate leftover of us like sticks that go in the sky and bom bom,btohqsg
potato canons are illegal in singapore.,btohqsg
isit illegal to throw charcoal into the sky and see flying ambers,btohqsg
If it potenitally injures a person  definitely,btohqsg
So have to agree with regulation,btohqsg
Isit illegal to throw hot fucking ambers? What kinda of question is dat,btohqsg
Na Fireworks don't rlly pose a threat to planes,btohqsg
Istg they did it near living estate areas during 2025's New Year Countdown,btohqsg
If the person is yourself does that also count,btohqsg
Provided the plane is High enough,btohqsg
or swing a ball of what iz basically reverse thermite around,btohqsg
As long as it's not in the direct descent path it's fine,btohqsg
Last time Singapore Kong Ming Lantern failed festival hahaaha,btohqsg
i guess we can tie sparkler to kite,btohqsg
Ah yes next up point lasers to planes too,btohqsg
Sir do u have a bomb?I have 50 kgs of high ordnance fireworks does that count?,btohqsg
I still cannot believe so many younger ppl still vape,btohqsg
this endangers fighter pilots at night  especially when they wear night vision goggles which amplifies light by maybe... 50X,btohqsg
closest thing u have is IR heads up display,btohqsg
ya but if just nice one fly past.,btohqsg
I am concerned if a crash could happen if ppl point laser at jets,btohqsg
Yea at most they wld just go wrong direction and kill a bird,btohqsg
What if wanna reenact the BP song*Look up in the sky it's a bird it's a plane.*,btohqsg
Well speaking of military during armed conflicts last year,btohqsg
my company just nuked diversity in line with trump's orders wtf,btohqsg
and i found out from redditü§°,btohqsg
Some pilots reported seeing cruise missile below the plane  üíÄ,btohqsg
Yes the jet is civilian jet flying with passengers on board,btohqsg
Just approximate wind speed with my hands,btohqsg
Who gives a shit about civilians,btohqsg
the power of laser.... you can shine it to the moon  and reflect off a mirror and back to earth,btohqsg
So the moon landing wasn't a hoax?,btohqsg
well they cld have just shot rockets up with mirrors,btohqsg
Some ppl say given technology of the day the moon landing can be faked,btohqsg
But it will be too obvious,btohqsg
If it is fake  the Soviets would have tried to discredit the Americans during the dark days of cold war.,btohqsg
I am pretty sure soviet radio technology is advanced enough to detect signals sent from moon to earth control station in NASA.,btohqsg
Then some say it would cost more money back then to fake moon landing compared to real,btohqsg
Unrelated to academic but fun to watch if you obsessed with transport   the scenery is good,btohqsg
GOT LION DANCE AT THE BLOODY UNIT,btohqsg
get me tf out of jurongüíî,btohqsg
Ahh just tolerate a few weeks,btohqsg
flying SQ for the first time in more than 10 years,btohqsg
My area also got ppl singing abs engaging lion dance,btohqsg
Oh I used to have one in my hdb before lmao,btohqsg
As long as they don't do anything noisy after 10 is okay,btohqsg
A sign to start revising bruh,btohqsg
i mean a dynamic ip will auto change after a while or when you restart the modem,btohqsg
just that in some cases you might be stuck with the same ip for quite long,btohqsg
but anyway your ip on its own has very limited use,btohqsg
yall know nus how to double major?,btohqsg
chem eng can double major with what ah,btohqsg
i saw only can iDP ISE and business... but idwww,btohqsg
ehh but got unrestricted one also right,btohqsg
i‚Äôm not too familiar with nus side but seems so,btohqsg
these are the ones you can declare at the point of application but you can apply for others even afterwards,btohqsg
i started to think about Y3 yesterday night... i cant cope with the distance :( I stay at the extreme east man,btohqsg
i mean you can still get the hall,btohqsg
idk i live in the east too lmao,btohqsg
I think they do have double degree programs but like,btohqsg
4 year undergrad + 3rd year of phd,btohqsg
like the second major and the single degree,btohqsg
you really really need to chill out fr,btohqsg
it‚Äôs impossible to plan things out perfectly for uni like this,btohqsg
you‚Äôre gonna kill the fun of it,btohqsg
but iw try nus double major,btohqsg
You can do a double degree prog with any major from chs,btohqsg
I.e. chem eng + chs majors,btohqsg
but trust me when i say there‚Äôs gonna be a lot of situations in uni that‚Äôll unexpectedly stress you out,btohqsg
Chem eng +:1. Public Health2. Data analytics3. Biomedical informatics4. info security,btohqsg
like uni isn‚Äôt about just academics and getting that paper,btohqsg
bc work is gonna be more of that sort of thing,btohqsg
imagine you stressing about every single day of work,btohqsg
‚Äúomg i made a small mistake am i gonna get fired‚Äù,btohqsg
like you say you can‚Äôt cope but i feel like you still would LOL,btohqsg
some of my friends ended up go home once a sem,btohqsg
anyway i stayed hall 5 years then just commuted afterwards,btohqsg
should try staying at least one sem,btohqsg
i just did a lot of hall stuff to get into their rec list,btohqsg
And I am just lazy so I did 1.5 yrs,btohqsg
The 0.5 yrs is cus I lazy to move back,btohqsg
then there‚Äôs some that don‚Äôt do much but still get hall in the end,btohqsg
as long as you‚Äôre not picky on which hall or room,btohqsg
Oh for me I just changed rm cus I decided to stay my 2nd yr as my last yr,btohqsg
anyway even if i grab back and forth every time i go sch,btohqsg
and as long as u don't mind getting extorted for a small ass room,btohqsg
wah nus also need hall points,btohqsg
nus is more competitive for hall,btohqsg
isit nus guarantee 1 year stay?,btohqsg
surprising tho... given that its localised in the central,btohqsg
Still need to compete for the space.,btohqsg
And it depends on your academic achievements and whether you‚Äôre an international scholar or not I believe.,btohqsg
localised in central = less space for halls = more competitive,btohqsg
NTU being in a jungle allows it to build all the halls it has,btohqsg
(and more expensive  might I add),btohqsg
although NTU (and NUS too I'm sure) loves to preach that their rental pricing is already below market price,btohqsg
which to be fair to them is not wrong considering bills are paid for,btohqsg
I think this applies only when comparing their own halls compared to other accomodations,btohqsg
when will we receive the confirmation letter regarding the course and uni we gg?,btohqsg
considering rental at like pioneer/boon lay is like 800-1000 alr,btohqsg
cld be as late as July,btohqsg
Omg food in hall is not cheap these days üò≠,btohqsg
if u mean the offer letter,btohqsg
the gap is closing though  annoyingly,btohqsg
does masters help in professional qualification,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why are you gonna worry for the next 6 months,btohqsg
i got the confirmation letter for NTU CCEB+ DA  but what if I use my rank points and put NUS Chem eng+ public health (second major) as my first choice?do I accept or rej NTU (by may)?,btohqsg
i also dont know if ill get into NUS leh,btohqsg
you wait first then figure it out if nus actually takes that long,btohqsg
instead of thinking you need to do smth right now,btohqsg
also this situation is so common you can just see what others say on reddit or smth,btohqsg
Plus you can also appeal if you dont get the choice you want,btohqsg
What do you mean as in professional qualifications?,btohqsg
helping someone to not overthink uni before even starting,btohqsg
you can accept NTU first tbh then if NUS offers u can change before the deadline,btohqsg
Ah  just a regular Tuesday then.,btohqsg
I like how nus can su cc,btohqsg
"They say ""takes too long to implement""",btohqsg
ikr ntu got some issues with this icc,btohqsg
my cc3 gonna drag me down very bad this sem,btohqsg
On the bright side cc3 allowing you to make friends.,btohqsg
Meanwhile I am in a zoom lesson with 3 ppl,btohqsg
Fyi this mod has participation pts so idk what happen to the other ppl,btohqsg
i suppose they just gave up on that class part,btohqsg
"Y3 is rlly the sem of ""fk u""",btohqsg
wah i applied gem explorer without reading the t&c,btohqsg
gonna go ogem office on monday to ask em,btohqsg
u guys went for exchange b4?,btohqsg
Nvr did but my friends did,btohqsg
cuz idk if eee allow core mod to be converted not,btohqsg
That one is not GEMs problem,btohqsg
no one went b4 from eee,btohqsg
I'll be going 3 diff office to ask,btohqsg
ogem  eee student exchange and icc,btohqsg
I wan go there exchange cuz,btohqsg
my house is right outside the sch,btohqsg
Wait u are a citizen of that country?,btohqsg
I check the terms seems like the restriction is only for discoverer,btohqsg
i will never not be salty about covid fucking me for this,btohqsg
Well u went exchange in 2024 :D,btohqsg
doesn't affect me having a house in China :P,btohqsg
cuz y2 going for exchange not so ez I got a lot of core to clear,btohqsg
But do u have Chinese Citizenship,btohqsg
(even though they are citizens also),btohqsg
U gonna have to clear specific mods for prerequisite,btohqsg
There's a cap of mods iirc depends on school,btohqsg
China good thing is the load is nb,btohqsg
>> if you want connections  there's linkedin for that.,btohqsg
heard is like below $600/month back in 2021 when I friend graduated from NTU.,btohqsg
>> depends on field. But most company don't really cares.Even in Intel Malaysia.Oh yeah RIP Intel Singapore. heard they closed doors last year.,btohqsg
if you're now a Singaporean  you can't technically inherit the China's house.,btohqsg
but people usually do that :P,btohqsg
just wait the house being reclaimed by the China government.,btohqsg
before they escape poverty and became Malaysians around 1950s,btohqsg
my uncles been trying to eying that piece of land / housing in China.,btohqsg
"in hopes of can ""resell"" to China and get some money back lol",btohqsg
but then it is some rural farmland area.,btohqsg
tbh china government don't really care nowadays  and we always have back up plans cuz all my relatives are still China citizen,btohqsg
want to know if can use masters instrad of uni degree,btohqsg
Nah it depends on what kind of house,btohqsg
One is government owned one is private owned,btohqsg
it will be stated on your property rights,btohqsg
farmlands are all government owned in China nowadays,btohqsg
Some Collective Land. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs private,btohqsg
but if any of the owner relative is China citizenship usually can still claim money,btohqsg
a bit troublesome but usually can,btohqsg
Just curious about sth uh ... does anyone have bank account overseas ?  just curious how student go US  UK and Australia to study and pay their school fees,btohqsg
You see   study overseas requires lots of money and it will not be desirable to pay by cash Ôºü,btohqsg
Go there work odd jobs to pay loan,btohqsg
Parents mortgage the house for you to take loan,btohqsg
Cannot get uk/usa job..don't dare come homeü§ê,btohqsg
Yup my mentor told me his CS degree cost 5k in UK currency per semester ahh I see,btohqsg
So ppl just loan and return later on,btohqsg
In particular I think US education system is a scam when it comes to offering useless degree courses.,btohqsg
Lmao ü§£ u better don't anyhow say here ok,btohqsg
You must rephrase..all unis is a good school tag to the company regulations üòÑ,btohqsg
But if you compared the cost to sg..obviously sg is more expensive that's why more students are going to other countries to explore other unis instead,btohqsg
U can set up a bank account overseas as long as you have a proof of address for most banks,btohqsg
He's classified as a Home/EU student,btohqsg
I think u forget to add housing food living and being a foreigner tax ah,btohqsg
even without those  sg uni still isn't even that expensive,btohqsg
Have to see what countries..I know Japan sponsor foreignersü§ê,btohqsg
I mean as a foreigner it is kinda ig but ya there are grants to offset the cost,btohqsg
It's comparable to other Asian Unis and we have a better reputation,btohqsg
yea but if you compare to the most common countries sg people go to,btohqsg
"Ya it's a ""freedom"" and ""grades"" issue",btohqsg
where exactly do you see this,btohqsg
Then again compare as foreigner or local. I know some especially the females have dual citizenship by birth and blood,btohqsg
U all want to go ah..but the uni have certain courses tag to help it's economic one,btohqsg
As males we are gender bound to Singapore,btohqsg
Almost all Unis have that tag.,btohqsg
Japan expensive. Everyday can eat sashimi happyüòÅ,btohqsg
Just split to Wise and Roulette?Then open a local bank account?,btohqsg
Australia is the best 1 SGD : ~1 AUD alternative. Except housing prices. rip.,btohqsg
otherwise  go apply to Malaysia where your family can pay 1:3.3 ü§£,btohqsg
I know gt ppl study in Korea and have to mug for TOPIK,btohqsg

Lingodeer is app for language lessons,btohqsg
Dun worry language learning can also do at study centre,btohqsg
My friend tells me quite ex for Korean,btohqsg

When work gets boring and I needed motivation,btohqsg
Or maybe you go Korea for business trip lol,btohqsg

Learning foreign language helps brain function which may translate to better studying,btohqsg
It can help delay dementia so I encourage it,btohqsg
Just don't study Korean while in math class can already!,btohqsg
ü§£ he's not replying means he's asleep üò¥,btohqsg
Anyone interested in training AI models?,btohqsg

Then first step is to learn how,btohqsg
Acha aap hindi baat kar sakte ho,btohqsg

Gotta make use of this weather,btohqsg
Sorry 2 fat man cant fit a single,btohqsg
I count as 2 fat man,btohqsg
Man thats harder than quantum mechanics,btohqsg
Because unlike qm i actually love food,btohqsg
Not me reading this while eating curry my mom made,btohqsg
i feel amazing after losing weight,btohqsg
tbh i realised that i pace around enough when thinking about my work,btohqsg
that it actually burns a good amount of calories,btohqsg
i pace around my living room for hours,btohqsg
Can see a circle of worn down flooring where si yan was pacing,btohqsg
Should get a step tracker to quantify it,btohqsg
ü§£ enjoy the cool weather till summer hits in next wk..31-34..bruhhh~,btohqsg
Damn you guys even have the capacity to think?,btohqsg
Thats why my gpa cannot buy chicken rice...,btohqsg
A pass degree is still a degree,btohqsg
Also why u never ask si yan give u higher grades,btohqsg
Thats wyatt i tell myself now,btohqsg
Apparently not hard enough what he gave u,btohqsg
‚ÄåKyon? Aap achi Hindi baat Kar sakte hai,btohqsg
Aap hindi ko upyogi karna hai,btohqsg
Sorry my Hindi is not the best,btohqsg
Though I took Hindi in N Levels  I got a 3 which is like 65-69 marks,btohqsg
tbf  i js call them cher,btohqsg
"its better to called them ""Ms""",btohqsg
yea when in doubt just default to this,btohqsg
there was a prof who was a sir but everyone thought hes a maam,btohqsg
i mean multiple people here alone have made a similar mistake with me,btohqsg
Hi everyone I'm a new member here,btohqsg
ü§£ laptop prices now so reasonable..mac vs gaming laptop,btohqsg
I rmb having a math teacher with a ms. And then from there we found out she got divorced,btohqsg
do you really find everything so funny to keep using that emoji,btohqsg
i got a laptop gifted by my relative tryna sell it off to carousell,btohqsg
Im p sure aftershocks laptops are quite baf,btohqsg
their prebuilt pc is okay right?,btohqsg
I was thinking between Mac pro or mcbook air..,btohqsg
i bought my laptop i think 3.5 years ago now,btohqsg
Ya off the shelf parts nth wrong,btohqsg
I thinking the ram seems more important...in case of submission,btohqsg
air works well for students i‚Äôd say,btohqsg
I'm afraid to bring my surface in case it crash,btohqsg
Im p sure mac got alot of them is soldered ram,btohqsg
unless you‚Äôre going for video editing and whatnot,btohqsg
As I gotten my surface for more than 4yrsü§ê,btohqsg
most students don't even need more than 8gb of ram for work. it's just whatever specific things outside of that that you need,btohqsg
is macos easy to get into btw,btohqsg
have been considering getting a macbook air but the os jump feels quite intimidating,btohqsg
Nah just they make laptops that are more repairability focused but in turn more ex,btohqsg
But their prices are so enticing üôÑ,btohqsg
Yesterday I went to Harvey Norman and compared the prices,btohqsg
Some more with student prices discount,btohqsg
Thanks to school not allowing ipadüôÑ,btohqsg
I thought they allow personal devices in school nowadays no?,btohqsg
Anyone down to help join a Tele Group for my school project? It‚Äôs a campaign for mental health  don‚Äôt need to say anything  but we just need more members. Pls dm me for the link,btohqsg
Feel like shopee or lazada cheaper tho,btohqsg
Lol laptop really have to buy uh,btohqsg
But desktop gt ppl build themselves,btohqsg
I am one of those who decided to build a desktop of own desired specs,btohqsg
The parts cost less than 900 üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I assembled and it worked pretty well in my opinion ... I do it mostly for budget reasons,btohqsg
I know..sim lim square does that,btohqsg
i mean if desktop ofc just do your own build,btohqsg
If home of course prefer own build,btohqsg
i just built my own pc and its not fun when something goes wrong and you dont know why,btohqsg
the ram being spoiled is not a skill issue :(,btohqsg
I have those portable keyboard..was hoping to bring it to school with ipad..ooh well,btohqsg
Save the hassle of bringing heavy bags,btohqsg
i could import from overseas but singapore dont allow import of animals,btohqsg
one thing about not seeing you much now is not having to hear this sort of joke,btohqsg
Prebuilts oso quite economical like aftershock,btohqsg
I can even import an elephant üêò..üôÑ,btohqsg
Not like sg got a micro center,btohqsg
the whole sim lim is our micro center,btohqsg
Lol later get charged with animal legislation,btohqsg
Their price got thattt competitive meh,btohqsg
Maybe when i upgrade ill check out,btohqsg
i mean electronic prices wont differ from places to places,btohqsg
Lmao..but whether can last long is another issue leh,btohqsg
yea but no prebuilts ever have the specs or types of parts i want,btohqsg
Lmao.. warranty say only leh..can ensure all gd meh,btohqsg
Like saying warranty will confirm no issues meh,btohqsg
yes but also i trust specific brands more than others,btohqsg
Oso not like repair is cheaper,btohqsg
If you don't use Windows as your pc os building it save $$ lol,btohqsg
oh actually how are surface laptops,btohqsg
There's a reason why lemon laws exist,btohqsg
heard they‚Äôre equivalent to macbooks but running windows,btohqsg
Surface can rewind the day where it breaks down,btohqsg
That's the reason why I'm sticking to it üòå as spare laptop,btohqsg
If you want repairability go framework iv,btohqsg
And obviously I know mac don't last long. I was watching my drama series suddenly blackout ‚ö´Ô∏è,btohqsg
And there's nth you can do abt it,btohqsg
Except to burry it in graveyard..rip,btohqsg
It can't deny the fact that in terms of pic screen illusions it show movie played in remarkable graphics,btohqsg
Except short life like fireworks üéÜ,btohqsg
with all laptops it depends on how you use it (and luck) lol,btohqsg
I mean other companies have oled screen laptops,btohqsg
macbooks are generally known to last quite long,btohqsg
Actually if u talk abt most lasting laptop got to be Panasonic,btohqsg
I think mine lived for freaking 6 yrs ü§£,btohqsg
Tho i swear panasonic give up alrdy lol,btohqsg
my msi hasn't had any issue other than changing a ram,btohqsg
If Panasonic ceo hadn't give the problem..I swear i will go with Panasonic,btohqsg
Luckily still got warranty but need claim thru aftershock,btohqsg
Big screen and speed all gd,btohqsg
And they said need wait cus they rma in bulk,btohqsg
Even with so much editing with pics so gd,btohqsg
Msi is tw brand if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
But I'm not much of a tech person when coming to repair pcs and etc,btohqsg
But if u talk tech obviously I knowüôÑ,btohqsg
I'm typing a lab report :D,btohqsg
I aint even create a document for lab report yet,btohqsg
I didnt complete the first lab report yet uh...,btohqsg
Wdym... we are doing lab tgt...,btohqsg
But I am just typing intros for the third lab experiment....,btohqsg
If you haven't complete i havent even start...,btohqsg
If TA says so i gotta do it,btohqsg
like you get 3 weeks for each experiment but reports due 1 week after the last session,btohqsg
The compulsory esperiment rlly easy to start,btohqsg
Is just that you need the object to complete,btohqsg
tbh it doesn't matter how much time you have,btohqsg
Not me always doing lab reports the night before its due for the past 2 years,btohqsg
Which sadly i cant access until nxt wk üò≠,btohqsg
bc you'll just complete it 1 night before anyway,btohqsg
man i really know you too well,btohqsg
I complete some of them among the wk tho,btohqsg
I think you know how i approach my studies,btohqsg
Even though im aware its bad,btohqsg
Siyan r u gonna get 5090üíÄ,btohqsg
Oh for me I wldnt have started this early,btohqsg
But since i cant visit during cny anyways,btohqsg
I has quiz to study for next week,btohqsg
Normally studying doesnt take place till week 13,btohqsg
Yall have quizzes at wk 4?,btohqsg
I think its like 10% each or smth,btohqsg
I remember im sad i have to study,btohqsg
But week 13 me gonna be happy i have minimal finals,btohqsg
Honestly playing music while dtudying is vibes,btohqsg
Sometimes can until i rly need hear myself think lol,btohqsg
Yea for me is the oppositr,btohqsg
You still need to find a compulsory internship/attachment,btohqsg
You need to do a presentation after the internship,btohqsg
Nah but to set an internship 1 year before is so,btohqsg
Dk why is only specific for us phy students only lmao,btohqsg
My only concern is whether i can grad and convo in time,btohqsg
technically if the company chooses to release your internship grade late  you can graduate but you must wait for next year's convocation,btohqsg
if i can afford it sure,btohqsg
convo is once a year but your degree needs to be conferred by a certain month first,btohqsg
so if it‚Äôs conferred late then your convo is pushed back,btohqsg
if you intern in the last sem it can cause the delay,btohqsg
it‚Äôs not a thing that‚Äôll fuck you yo,btohqsg
3 mnths away from graduation tho,btohqsg
i mean in the long run its not really that big of a deal but,btohqsg
yknow you want to graduate with the friends you actually know,btohqsg
they literally warn you that if you intern in your last sem  the admin stuff might not be settled before convocation,btohqsg
there‚Äôs a ton of admin and logistics to settle,btohqsg
all you see is name on cert + ceremony,btohqsg
Well thankfully i did intern in y2,btohqsg
Now i just need to do the fyp,btohqsg
like for example if i defend my dissertation in july,btohqsg
technically is there any way to hasten up their process so i can attend convo in time,btohqsg
i might not have convocation with yall,btohqsg
realistically you can try to get them to push but there‚Äôs a limit,btohqsg
i might delay my convocation tho if i intern,btohqsg
Do you have a y4s1 mod you are interested in?,btohqsg
tbf it‚Äôs objectively the safer choice,btohqsg
atp he just wants to grad,btohqsg
You cannot do mods with internship,btohqsg
That is just the shittiest thing,btohqsg
it‚Äôs a it sucks but i gets situation,btohqsg
that one is really not a concern to me,btohqsg
That's like 17% off on shopee,btohqsg
because atp my plan doesnt require me to study anymore,btohqsg
I rmb the ndp musical directior hardcore fan of applr...,btohqsg
Eventually you have to clear the grad requirementd,btohqsg
With the price I rather get an airtag,btohqsg
i have enough s/u and moocs to play that,btohqsg
"i dont need to ""study"" anymore",btohqsg
Can I get a BDE swap yall give me your extra BDEs,btohqsg
I have 6 major ones.And 15 bde left,btohqsg
Lmao I can do 2 minors with that,btohqsg
Why u no like minor. U get to explore man,btohqsg
For me I been in choir   making the pun even more hilarious üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Wait I just realised 15aus as in,btohqsg
we are talking about strictly bde,btohqsg
intern AU comes from MPE right,btohqsg
i think i gotta shift my intern to y4s1,btohqsg
i mean in the grand scheme of things it really doesnt change anything much,btohqsg
just that i did have a y4s1 mod i wanted to do,btohqsg
I wonder if anyone did intern while secretly doing a y4s1 mod,btohqsg
I have seen cases of ppl bringing forward hw0218 or ps0001 or ps0002 but never rlly much of this case,btohqsg
They literally have it in massive letters when u open up the document,btohqsg
How isit their fault if ppl don't read the terms and conditions,btohqsg
idt stars would allow you to?,btohqsg
and even if they did  once office finds out they might just remove,btohqsg
The reason is cuz CAO is a separate department,btohqsg
U can't. U are registered in semester for that mod,btohqsg
I did internship while doing ori related stuff...,btohqsg
Yeah it's not on the record,btohqsg
Essentially your SPMS admin has to first grant you a time stamp exception because Intern sem automatically locks you out of the stars system,btohqsg
Then after that u need to somehow register for mods but u cannot use STARs,btohqsg
3 of these mods are sem fking 1,btohqsg
and the other mods im already doing them now,btohqsg
So u can only do it during Add drop ig assuming even that if the admin says yes,btohqsg
Essentially if you are on intern/exchange the system locks u out,btohqsg
Soft condensed is sem 2 but abt chem,btohqsg
i see 4k mod i scared tho,btohqsg
tbh 4k vs 3k the difference isn't that big,btohqsg
honestly its not an issue for me,btohqsg
1 to 2k and 2 to 3k is a larger leap,btohqsg
i am gonna do 2 mods in that sem  and just s/u both,btohqsg
but the problem is i also intend to do a non-credit bearing internship in that sem  so i dk if i can find the time to at least pass the mod,btohqsg
I sound like a y4 saying that,btohqsg
its more like  (assuming i do get a non-credit bearing internship in that sem) will i be alive after work to at least read up about the mod and know enough to pass,btohqsg
fyp + 2 4k mods for the entire two sems,btohqsg
roughly gonna be same for me  i guess rn the plan is to intern y4s1  then do 2 BDE (S/Ued) and 9 MOOC for sem 2 to grad (and do another intern somewhere),btohqsg
Think is possible to do a legal internship  esp since smu mostly have that requirement (idk smu requirements but certain unis have that compulsory intern requirement),btohqsg
But whether you can find one or self source one is a diff story,btohqsg
Idk if law firms will want me,btohqsg
I.e. doing up a resume  interviews and all those things,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt think I can find a job,btohqsg
I shld just isekai myself into another world,btohqsg
I wld say try to gain work relevant work experiences,btohqsg
I hope some NS transport operator just isekai me with a truck,btohqsg
U know u can double count rite?,btohqsg
So u can get a free minor essentially,btohqsg
I think it might be quite hard to minor at y4,btohqsg
6AUs double count + 6AUs S/U and u choose 1/3 of the mod to be your graded 3AU BDE,btohqsg
wha za fak is double count,btohqsg
i aint smart enough to game NTU system like that,btohqsg
I can use for physics major,btohqsg
Count your MPE or Core as part of the requirements for a minor,btohqsg
I can also use for math minor,btohqsg
So 12 au more to complete math minor,btohqsg
Is that the only common course between the 2?,btohqsg
15 au - 6 au = 9au,btohqsg
9AU = 3 ModsSU limit is 6AUsSo u choose 1/3 mods to be graded BDE,btohqsg
I forgot how to study since I enlisted,btohqsg
ME GO WHERE ME SHOOT WHAT,btohqsg
Oh you dont wanna know how many ppl have gone thru that painful experience of getting their memory back from ns,btohqsg
do you know any other seniors,btohqsg
ah okay that one yeah i know,btohqsg
CAO takes time to process it,btohqsg
yea don't do it if you can help it,btohqsg
It took them 1.5 months for my to reflect,btohqsg
sian i did have mods i want to do in y4s1,btohqsg
Legit lmao they even put in bold letters. That's the clearest indication that they have been asked that so many times,btohqsg
Our cores only end at y3s1,btohqsg
But erm if you dont do fyp  max can get is a 2nd upper,btohqsg
For applied  is by right y3s1.,btohqsg
by right they can eat my ass  who's gonna do lab with that 4 core mods in y3s1,btohqsg
i think the problem is not the core mod,btohqsg
The problem is 1 of them is anal mech,btohqsg
And the other is qm 2,btohqsg
Actually now that i think of it,btohqsg
I actually wonder how many ppl will end up realising about the internship thing,btohqsg
The internship part is compulsory. Sadly.,btohqsg
Last time it was intern or fyp,btohqsg
thank god i have this at the back of my mind,btohqsg
Cus i definitely know some wld actually end up doing in y4s2.,btohqsg
