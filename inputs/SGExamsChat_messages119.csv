Isn’t promos like 3 months away,btohqsg
Some ppl mug 3 years ahead,btohqsg
That sounds like me for Os last time,btohqsg
I heard that you are studying university chemistry,btohqsg
I like how everyone knows who I'm talking about,btohqsg
I mug the day before my rest,btohqsg
Explain to us why alcl3 is covalent,btohqsg
Going against a widely accepted theory,btohqsg
Ur not the only one studying ahead anyways,btohqsg
Revolutionising chemistry at the age of 17,btohqsg
This was how ppl proved the earth revolves around the sun,btohqsg
@cringnormidotcomwrong the world revolves around you,btohqsg
Maybe your name should be@chemchernow then,btohqsg
Wa wa  so how's your physics?,btohqsg
And what about your physics teacher?,btohqsg
or am i the only degenerate here,btohqsg
i cant jog 60km in a day,btohqsg
gave up joggin a while ago after my knee starts hurting,btohqsg

In case those who wan stock up,btohqsg

lmao the bus driver emergency brake  and we had a thrill of time on D1 of P2,btohqsg

idw to book out standing on the train,btohqsg
Hey everyone  if you happen to come across a bubble tea outlet  please take a snapshot of the queue for the outlet and post it here,btohqsg
I want to know how the queue is like across different outlets 😂,btohqsg
Covid is coming to get you Johnny,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionwhen you were schooling did you do h2 tys,btohqsg
Or you just practice your fm,btohqsg
I never did any H2 Maths,btohqsg
Can you say the same for your classmates haha,btohqsg
But if your foundations not good you should definitely do TYS,btohqsg
My classmates range greatly in ability,btohqsg
But idk if im good at certain topics cause i havent been tested yer,btohqsg
I have a h2 test on vectors graphs and eqns coming up,btohqsg
It should be easy but maybe ill just brush up on vectors,btohqsg
I took clb last year its easy man,btohqsg
About 3 points too short man,btohqsg
I mean nyjc points plus 3 is my points,btohqsg
I took clb so i cant really get 3 too haha,btohqsg
6 points is the lowest you can get for l1r5,btohqsg
If you take higher mother tongue it becomes 2,btohqsg
Well  you could always -2 for affiliation,btohqsg
Im from a 188 sch i dont think we are affiliated to anything hahaha,btohqsg
Is complex no. one of the more easier topics in fm,btohqsg
huh no don't think that lol,btohqsg
like even as a joke is kinda shows that the inferiority complex,btohqsg
Complex is one of the big topics in pure FM  third to conics and linear algebra,btohqsg
Induction  recurrence  polar curves are easier than complex,btohqsg
Learn linear algebra well  helps u alot in uni,btohqsg
Maybe the examples are easier and i havent tried exam qns yet,btohqsg
Linear algebra is the meeting point of pure and applied maths,btohqsg
If it has anything to do with science,btohqsg
Whats the difference between pure and applied math again,btohqsg
Applied maths has less focus on proofs  more on application,btohqsg
Right now i just know that math is split into 'normal' and stats,btohqsg
So if you make a statement you don’t really have to prove it thoroughly,btohqsg
Pure maths is all about proofs,btohqsg
What you do in JC is more applied maths than pure maths,btohqsg
Do the jcs tell you that,btohqsg
Or we have to know ourselves,btohqsg
Or its good to know ourselves,btohqsg
H3 math is a more suitable indicator to see if u are suitable for pure math,btohqsg
The difference between applied and pure?,btohqsg
Best you can do is take H3 to see for yourself what pure maths is,btohqsg
Wait im curious before fm how did people get into unis that require it,btohqsg
Theres no course that require fm,btohqsg
No course in SG requires FM  now and before,btohqsg
Yeah but fid that mean people in sg couldnt get into those courses,btohqsg
Or did they grant an exception,btohqsg
I dunno about the other unis  but Oxbridge only recently made FM a requirement,btohqsg
FM is only one of the recognized subjects for most courses  you can use Physics or Chemistry in place of it,btohqsg
I just realised john and the other dude photo are opposites of each other,btohqsg
I've never heard of H2 FM being required,btohqsg
Wait i thought h3 was for scholarships or for meeting 4h2 req,btohqsg
We dont got * in sg though right,btohqsg
This is not the correct one,btohqsg
The correct one for SG is thishttps://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/singapore,btohqsg
"""Applicants should take relevant H3 subjects""",btohqsg
They have a page specifically for SG,btohqsg
Yeah  but it appears that many don't know about it,btohqsg
Well  the FM would be part of the 4H2s,btohqsg
But apparently H3 merit may count for a H2 A,btohqsg
Too bad the step exam is already over,btohqsg
Maybe I’ll try next year if__doesn’t accept me,btohqsg
Well  I need TS to go to either uni anyway,btohqsg
The prestige doesn’t seem worth the price tag,btohqsg
The content is made for FMaths students,btohqsg
If thats coming from you im worried how i would fare hahaha,btohqsg
Do they test out of syllabus?,btohqsg
I mean not much of a syllabus to follow,btohqsg
They state their syllabus  and they follow it,btohqsg
If you dont go oxbridge is it generally good to go for other uk unis,btohqsg
Or is it basically oxbridge vs nus/ntu for post a lvl choices,btohqsg
Usually I went to the study room at the CC though,btohqsg
Which uni do you go to*,btohqsg
I can see how my qn can be misinterpreted hahaha,btohqsg
Was your As this year or last yeat,btohqsg
Idk why i always had the assumption you were j4,btohqsg
As in 2nd year of ns,btohqsg
*intense stares while I have to be stuck in nee soon camp*,btohqsg
If i wanna work in sg for an mnc is studying in sg btr?,btohqsg
Yep they are quite good too#9 and #10 in the world respectively,btohqsg
Nope  it's more like London+Oxbridge vs local,btohqsg
No mye so i dont really have grades yet,btohqsg
Please don't mind the kmfst watermark 😩,btohqsg
Past year EL LC has this music,btohqsg
I'm vetting my investments now for mid- long term upside risk. What are some of the indicators to watch out for? Thank u.,btohqsg
In a group with mainly students,btohqsg
Managing risks... market took a turn the worse today but bought some stocks at discount,btohqsg
hi sir this is a Wendy's,btohqsg
Send the link!! Send the link!!,btohqsg
Oh  I thought you're some scammer,btohqsg
yay bedok gna get sued by seab,btohqsg
But I don't think fellow students can give advice over stocks,btohqsg
They have better things to do,btohqsg
Mmm my cousin from smu business and when we met she gave good advice tho,btohqsg
It plays all the time 😩,btohqsg
Anw dm me if u know thx  u,btohqsg
Idk much about stocks but I hope u didn't buy risky ones,btohqsg
Though tbf all stocks and investments carry risk,btohqsg
I invested 30k... made 5k . Now all paper loss but waiting for the upside. I only bought big companies with little risk but I wanna urgently vet now. Today stocks crashed,btohqsg
Withdrew and made $7... mmm   it was too scary 😒,btohqsg
imagine having that much capital to begin with,btohqsg
I'm never ever gonna do day trading again.  Like I put $1k into Medtecs. It is a catalist gloves and masks manufacturer on SGX. damn scared .... Weekly still ok.,btohqsg
U dont need much to invest.  Like sg has no minimum lot size...  Companies like singtel and sia have 50% or more upside. I dont see any reason why these companies will fail or stay low.  Almost 100% gteed profits upon recovery if u can hold few month. So like 1000 becomes 1500 or 2000... lailai invest into sg and push prices up ❤️,btohqsg
sorry my bank oni got $1.64,btohqsg
Mine worse le. $0. 😂😂😂😂😂😂 all in stocks liao,btohqsg
I'm damn broke now I literally got less than 1 dollar on me 😀,btohqsg
Exams in this chat not investing 😔,btohqsg
If so money stuck longer 😂,btohqsg
But now my bank account shall grow with the power of saf,btohqsg
Even though saf's power is hella puny,btohqsg
At least it’s just the core subjects,btohqsg
I said this with no knowledge of what Brexit's impacts are on school education,btohqsg
But you’ve been on both sides of the grass,btohqsg
Bruh I researched that the other day,btohqsg
All undergraduate courses are taught in German there,btohqsg
Besides  it has no accomodation and international students will need to rent their own,btohqsg
Not everyone would be willing to spend a foundation year learning German,btohqsg
i talk to this person on dating app then we talking pretty ok then we say meet tmr,btohqsg
then i ask what time where,btohqsg
im losing so much faith in humanity sia,btohqsg
Provided we can get in. The test is ridiculously difficult,btohqsg
Anyone knows the difficulty of entrance for UCL/ICL?,btohqsg
I checked ucl and the minimum req to apply is 3h2 abb for sg a lvls,btohqsg
But I would presume need straight As,btohqsg
QS is only one limited way to assess quality,btohqsg
A in three H2 subjects and a decent PS,btohqsg
Cant find much details about icl though,btohqsg
Does UK in general care much about ccas and leadership,btohqsg
That answers my qn i guess,btohqsg
So get good grades to get in basically,btohqsg
They don't even ask for it,btohqsg
Overall spend half an hour can complete the app,btohqsg
Do they have their own internal tests like oxbridge,btohqsg
Plus whatever time you need for personal statement,btohqsg
Icl CS has a separate test and interview,btohqsg
EIE doesn't have a test but has interview,btohqsg
They might interview you over video call,btohqsg
Oh i get what you mean,btohqsg
Imo even if you get Oxbridge  without scholarship  you should think again on roi,btohqsg
With scholarship though  think again whether 6 years is worth it,btohqsg
Is icl and ucl fees any better though,btohqsg
Or is that advice generally for all uk unis,btohqsg
Oxbridge have college fees which most other universities don't,btohqsg
Factor in whatever London cost you have,btohqsg
At more than 60k a year  an extra 10 is marginal,btohqsg
Imo doesn't matter much. You already spent 60k. You spend 10k more for Oxbridge premium,btohqsg
9K pounds for a typical college fee,btohqsg
You spend extra 50k to go ucl/icl,btohqsg
Your marginal benefit is how much,btohqsg
From ucl icl  u spend extra 15k to go Oxbridge  marginal benefit is how much,btohqsg
My fee status doesn't change the validity of whatever I say,btohqsg
Weigh the marginal cost and benefit  and make a decision from there,btohqsg
So what made the marginal benefit large enough for you?,btohqsg
That's why I ask that ppl rethink carefully,btohqsg
And ppl don't need to make the same,btohqsg
So you wish you just studied locally in SG?,btohqsg
International students are subject to college fees,btohqsg
what's the chance of getting scholarship  just wondering?,btohqsg
If you dont mind me asking  what was the mistake?,btohqsg
Going for 6 year scholarship or burdening the cost,btohqsg
He probably meant going to oxbridge,btohqsg
I most likely want to stay local lah... cos I'm from a middle class family and idw come out of uni in debt,btohqsg
It probably came with one of the two then,btohqsg
Either he got a scholarship but hates rbe company,btohqsg
Or he has to burden high costs,btohqsg
My mistake is going overseas at all,btohqsg
There is something called mum and dad scholarship,btohqsg
Honestly it sounds like its btr to go local uni then exchange program for experience,btohqsg
U spend 500 pct more to go ucl but the increase in reputation ranking is marginal,btohqsg
I'm an arts student and I intend to do theatre related stuff haha  not sure if I even want to get bonded with a company,btohqsg
Then again  you are the only one who can define cost and benefit,btohqsg
lao ba lao ma not rich,btohqsg
Arts is bad in SG from what I heard,btohqsg
If money is of no issue then money is not a good indicator of marginal cost,btohqsg
Don't worry I know what I'm getting into,btohqsg
I did extensive research and I'm already deep into starting my own community,btohqsg
In all honesty I only look at this ranking,btohqsg
Any of y'all interested in arts career? Like look. I know everyone says arts in SG is bad but... idk (no offense!!) but in a way I feel like pushing that narrative is part of the problem,btohqsg
What do employers look at for fresh grads,btohqsg
So does the uni matter much,btohqsg
This is more reliable than qs?,btohqsg
What teaching quality and bs who the heck cares,btohqsg
Better qualify  who the heck in the industry cares,btohqsg
Ppl hire employees based on perception,btohqsg
It uses different criteria than QS,btohqsg
I only care about how well the school can provide u with resources,btohqsg
Ofc rankings cant really be the only factor,btohqsg
And your favorite Oxbridge is at the top,btohqsg
But one of the advising factors,btohqsg
Based on what metric u use to choose uni,btohqsg
My favorite is Stanford but whatever,btohqsg
Ease of getting a job and pay,btohqsg
That and more importantly connections and network,btohqsg
Ur school fades away after ur first job,btohqsg
Ur connections and perception of u dont,btohqsg
Cambridge has bell curve too from what I heard,btohqsg
But not as disgusting as nus,btohqsg
This is for which one again?,btohqsg
Apart from the toilet peeping incidents,btohqsg
Then again the quality of students affect the competition,btohqsg
My anecdotal exp in nus is,btohqsg
Haven't seen you being active on this grp lately,btohqsg
Oh ya what doing you recently,btohqsg
Oh wait youre the one from the non oxbridge uni that john tagged right,btohqsg
I ask him abt non oxbrifge uk unis,btohqsg
Ask me will Kenna wrekt by me I presume,btohqsg
Maybe another time though im bout to sleep,btohqsg
I got paid 0 in poly also,btohqsg
