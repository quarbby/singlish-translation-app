When I applied for EGA I was working in raffles place so I walked into branch and open,btohqsg
Those cannot apply is because of the gift on singsaver I believe. If you have a cc  u are existing customer  u HAVE to go down to the branch  cannot do online. I called them to check  a bit silly but this is the process…,btohqsg
Just wanted to share that if you’ve reached FRS  do keep a look out for when your MA gets deducted for medical or insurance. You can use that opportunity to top-up your MA to get tax relief.,btohqsg
The cc is so much better where you just click activate on the app itself rather then calling,btohqsg
NGL I click wrong so many time on the call  took me 15 min to activate it,btohqsg
Ether card number press wrong or OTP press wrong,btohqsg

Yo guys  I wanted to buy stock on moomoo  but it keeps saying insufficient max buying power  I have fund 1000sgd into the account and change to USD already  how do I fix this?,btohqsg
Do you have any options position that you may have opened?,btohqsg
It is much easier to sell all and buy back on the new platform. Yes there will be transaction costs but it will be much less stressful and time consuming than all the transfer headaches in between,btohqsg
Also it depends on how large is your position  which affects the transaction cost,btohqsg
