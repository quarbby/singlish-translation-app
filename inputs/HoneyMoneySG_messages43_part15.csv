TLDR:HSBC EGA GIRO  Cardup/ipaymy  Citi Payallhttps://youtu.be/-tV6F8NEjQQ,btohqsg
For US stocks/ETF  I compared most of the online brokerage in terms of FX rate and fees. The best low fee and good FX rate for small sum investment will be interactive broker. I dca small amount (100 USD) every month but the fee is only 0.38 USD.Fx rate wise  the conversion is good but need to pay a fee per transaction. Thus  it is advisable to convert only above 1000 SGD to USD per transaction.,btohqsg
Probably not if you are look at how many miles you can earn per dollar. But the card can earn miles for most general spend categories.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  does HSBC Every Rewards+ give 1% rebate for HDB loans paid via GIRO?,btohqsg
anything that you can setup REGULAR GIRO (not adhoc) will qualify. I don't think there are any exclusions.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm planning to transfer Giro payments to HSBC EGA for my income tax  property tax and HDB Loan and Conservancy fees,btohqsg
Ok i plan to get it to complement hsbc revo n citi rewards,btohqsg
Just be mindful of the deduction dates and ensure you have sufficient balance in your account.,btohqsg
Yes. Though you have to weigh the cost vs benefits of1) Using CPF to pay  then put cash in high yield accounts/FD/T-bill/SSB2) HSBC 1% Cashback and etcWhich one is more beneficial for you,btohqsg
Currently using CPF to pay  but not enough so need top up cash. So that‚Äôs why trying to get back some cash via EGA üòÖ,btohqsg
is citi credit card annual fee easily can be waived?,btohqsg
Can I ask if Citibank premier miles credit card is a good miles card? Been stuck on this for awhile cause of the many transfer partners,btohqsg
good for specific promos e.g. citi payall  4mpd for overseas spend,btohqsg
Gd afternoon to allSi FuAny of u having problems with Hsbc revolution points?I noticed that the points i got don't tally with my spent.Every single of my transactions falls within the white list.example: I spent $500.( 10x points for white list purchase). I understand the dollar round up thing but it wouldn't be that far from 5000pts that I supposed to get.in the end the points i got are only3500..Is there anyway to check which transaction didn't give 10x points?,btohqsg
Thank you. I appreciate the insight üí™üèª,btohqsg
HSBC Revo card works on a white list method.. so that's a bit dangerous unless you are very very sure the merchant is included.,btohqsg
Yes  as long as there is activityhttps://youtu.be/G_knBWbfw9Q,btohqsg
It's a good entry level card  you may also consider other citi miles card options in this videohttps://youtu.be/lyPKS4IOMuw,btohqsg
Yes  usually I have one or two transactions don‚Äôt get 9x  you can call CS  but sometimes the effort not worth it  unless big items missing,btohqsg
the most lame is HSBC Movie Card... don't earn 10x,btohqsg
Once I called  they said Kfc don‚Äôt earn 9x  weird  but it‚Äôs only $10+  so don‚Äôt bother,btohqsg
Hey folks  I have a standard chartered simply credit card which gives 1.5% cash back  the annual fee was waived for the first two years  and I suspect they might charge the annual fee this upcoming July 2023  is there anyway to avoid this charges? Call them to waive it off?,btohqsg
Call in to request for waiver  SC shouldn't be too difficult,btohqsg
ya if they dun waiver  jus ask to cancel  confirm they will go and do the waiver,btohqsg
UOB just rejected my fee waiver  I requested to cancel.Then they say retention department will call me in a few days. Will update again,btohqsg
Wishing you all the best. May you get the fees waived.I understand some cards have auto fee waiver schemes such as EVOL 3 spends a month for 12 months or Singtel-UOB must charge at least Singtel billBut for VS PPV KFCC etc it is all unknown,btohqsg
In 2022 I have experience from SC whereby if you dont hit the min spend amount for the year  they wont waive off. The CSA or whoever in charge of this can‚Äôt overwrite the system also. It‚Äôs not even a ‚Äúthey will appeal and try‚Äù kind of scenario like UOB its a ‚Äúthe rules are the rules I also cannot help‚Äù kind of scenario.Idk if their policies have changed in the past 1 year. So best is you call in/online chat with them early to ask. Else you will have to pay for 1 more year‚Äôs annual fee before you can cancel,btohqsg
Good luck Chris. Quite an annoying process cuz UOB also don‚Äôt state if there is a min spend for auto waiver (based on UOB ONE card),btohqsg
Ya for UOB one i managed to waive off then faster cancel the card.,btohqsg
annual fee are charged for the upcoming year and not the year that has past  so if you are asking them to cancel the card they should not charge you.,btohqsg
it still depends on your spending in the past year  at least for SC. Eg if in 2021 you hit the min spend $12k then 2022 they will waive off. I also asked to cancel  their response is can but you still need to pay off the annual fee. Suck thumb lor else if you keep fighting them you end up paying interest for overdue statementü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
If you really enjoy the card  just cancel early and sign up for the card again,btohqsg
What about those debit card. UOB charge me fee also sia,btohqsg
Question: is there any way to know what is the min spend for the cards?,btohqsg
Just go the cashier tell them u want to buy,btohqsg
Yes. Is there a min spend amount like what OCBC stated for all their cards?,btohqsg
for SC they stated in the terms and condition.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt see any min Auto fee waiver min threshold in SCB Rewards+ or SimplyCash ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
means they removed this info lor. previously i was holding on to SC Spree and their T&C got say. not every bank will tell you upfront also  like DBS live fresh and UOB Absolute also they dont mention,btohqsg
hi all just to check  for EGA it's ok to withdraw from the account right? I do not need to ensure that the average balance is always higher than the previous month right?,btohqsg
so after reading thru so many experience of others abt annual fee  you gotta be proactive when it comes to this lor.,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre doing the promotion it‚Äôs only towards the referenced month.,btohqsg
You will need to care about month on month incremental balance if you are after the 1% bonus interest on top of the SMS promotion.,btohqsg
Hey experts  does Apple digital subscriptions such as Apple Music/ Apple Arcade/Apple TV+ count to Standard chartered Smart CC rewards under Streaming entertainment?,btohqsg
you didn't tell ask them : You don't know who I am?,btohqsg
Rui En vibes strong with this one,btohqsg
If you're talking about the 6% Cashback  no. It's not whitelisted as such. It can get 0.5% Cashback though I assume.(Cashback in the form of points  to be clear.),btohqsg
I'm just a commoner who is in the online media space  not a big shot anyway,btohqsg
Don't blame the CSOs  sometimes it's their internal procedure.,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone knows how to find my PIN and Group ID for SCB?I forgot my password :/,btohqsg
