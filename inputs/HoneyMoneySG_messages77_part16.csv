"Not really capped but they only see ""2k spending"". Other bonus cashback from UOB ONE will come from selected spending as well (to min-max  these spending should be within the 2k).And this spending MUST be consistent every month.",btohqsg
If you actually min-max it well  you'll get 8.33% cashback. 2k cashback in a year  which is like paying 11 months for your 12 months spending.,btohqsg
@rpsg999once you breakdown  plug your number into this calculator. Then adjust your supposed spending.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/cashback/one-card-cashback-calculator.pageThen for the excess of 2k  you can look into other cards.,btohqsg
lol u guys confusing dollar cost averaging METHODOLOGY with averaging.U need to understand that DCA methodology is based on the basis of capturing market return over long term thru an index etf.So therefore passive investors aspire to do that  hence dca methodology has to be used on broad based underlying on equity index or FI index.By doing averaging on a stock or thematic defeats the very purpose of that.,btohqsg
We have very different definition of thematics.When I say thematics  it refers to any specific asset class or theme investment because it follows a ‚Äútheme‚Äù and not broad based.By doing a TLT  which is 20+ years treasury bond  it is on a specific segment of the fixed income space  that in itself is thematic.,btohqsg
People like to quip dca methodology without even knowing the basis of how this came about and how it is to be applied.It‚Äôs a joke to quote using DCA on single security or ‚Äúthematic‚Äù,btohqsg
Please be aware that DCA is not passive investing.I am aware that Many investors use dollar cost averaging as part of a passive investment strategy  meaning they invest in passively-managed index funds that track an entire market.However DCA with its potential to mitigate timing risk  is most often employed for riskier investments such as stocks and mutual funds.Dollar cost averaging does not spare you the work of choosing an appropriate asset to invest in.,btohqsg
Still nothing for me. My balance still reflected as 02 Dec,btohqsg
lolThat‚Äôs why I say u don‚Äôt understand the difference btw DCA methodology vs averagingThe fundamental basis for dca is utilized by passive investors.As an active investor  who seeks to create alpha  u can use averaging as a strategy but that‚Äôs not dca methodology.Take some time to digest this,btohqsg
Conventional meaning of thematics in the investment world currently are themes like sustainable energy etc. Treasury bonds investment can hardly be seen as any sort of Theme.,btohqsg
DCA is simply not having to time the market. Has nothing to do with passive investing. Also DCA is not averaging that is for sure.,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs look at the fundamentalYour quoted example is on 20+ year treasuries  that‚Äôs just 1 segment of the entire Treasury bond universe. Isn‚Äôt that thematic?Furthermore  the financial world uses 10Y as the risk free rate reference benchmark,btohqsg
So if dca is simply to not time the market  what‚Äôs the objective of that? Think about itIf u use dca on a specific security or thematic  and still run the beta riskU r simply defeating the basis of doing dca LMAO,btohqsg
two of you are argue about the definition of thematic. To respond to that  TLT should not be considered as thematic just because it is a subset of US treasuries. Even S&P500 is a subset of entire US or world stock market  but we will not label it as thematic.But if you buy into TLT not for passive investing but you are betting on interest rate to decrease  and you will shift out of TLT if you sense that your thesis is wrong  then you are basically a macro investor that is using ETF to trade.Nothing wrong with that. We are still discussing about definition of various terms.,btohqsg

hey everyone. question for cards that accept simplygo as eligible spend:if the transport payment is done thru payment apps like samsung pay  applepay or gpay  are they still counted as simplygo transactions?Or must use simplygo app for payment then is counted?,btohqsg
The SimplyGo app is just to track transport transactions  make claims‚Ä¶ the app doesn‚Äôt allow you to make payment like a mobile wallet.Tapping physically or via mobile wallets linked to your credit card for bus and trains counted as SimplyGo‚Ä¶ topping up your mobile wallet like Grab or Ezlink card via the topup machine or online apps does not.,btohqsg
most cards accept simplygo as eligible spend e.g. dbs livefresh 10% rebate  maybank family and friends 8%  uob one 8.33%-10%  uob evol 6.67%https://heymax.ai/merchant/SimplyGo,btohqsg
Hi is it better to use Amaze+Privi miles combo overseas or just use Privi card straight to earn foreign spend miles?,btohqsg
Amaze+prvi and assuming u used up limit on Amaze+uob lady and Amaze+crmc,btohqsg
would like to ask opinion on UOB one vs evol. currently using uob one but not heavily spend on ACBM. Only reason still stick to it is due to SPC CB. Still make sense if switch to EVOL? if so  any strat recommend for petrol if switch to evol?,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt using the amaze converts all transactions into local online spend?,btohqsg
Hi all new to this chat  wondering if there is any archive on Amaze + CC best combi for oversea spend.Also can I use Amaze for agoda/booking.com?,btohqsg
Hi Chris  is this for new customer for moneybull cash voucher? I don‚Äôt see it on my promotion page,btohqsg
Let me zoom into this TLT saga he raisedThis is focusing on specifically >20 years maturity Treasury bonds. It‚Äôs a very narrow band of asset class. So it is a thematic play by any definition.Your quoted example about S&P being a subset of the entire  US stock market or world equities but it‚Äôs not considered a thematic is a lousy argument because S&P comprise of 11 sectors and accounts for approx 80% of US cap size. So to try to argue that way is a false equivalence.,btohqsg
S&P500 is 100% US and is 1 out of 200 countries in the world so it is thematic because you are betting that US will do better than average world,btohqsg
Break down your expenses. Then you'll know if it make sense for you to switch to UOB EVOL or stay with UOB One. UOB EVOL is 6.67% effective cashback  when you pay for petrol  you can clock under mobile contactless.,btohqsg
Keen on this.. but worry the USD100k may not be withdraw-able when time comes.. hope Chris or anyone here can enlighten,btohqsg
try trading it  better passive income thn just locking your money there,btohqsg
Again let‚Äôs look below the surface.What are the companies that make up the S&P 500 and what‚Äôs their geographical revenue distribution from?Also measure S&P 500 cap+ volume & liquidity vs MSCI world equities.Try harder,btohqsg
There's no lock in  can even withdraw now but that disqualifies you for the reward,btohqsg
Already gave u the hintsGo find the answer and know your erroneous statements earlierDon‚Äôt expect to be spoonfed for everything,btohqsg
yes  that's why get 4mpd on Amaze+crmc. Why this qn?,btohqsg
I signed up for the cimb savings 3.5% interest back in aug. I recalled it lasts for 6 months with ref month being jul. What will happen after the 6 months? Will i still get the 3 5% with ref jul amount?,btohqsg

hahaha u also same like me dunno the answer üòÜ,btohqsg
"Ok so i assume the 6 months promo will still ""expire"". Is there anywhere i can see when is expires?",btohqsg

Does anyone knows if gym membership fees can earn 10x points from citi rewards Mastercard?,btohqsg
My bad  I thought OP wants to use Amaze for the foreign spend miles. I misread that OP wants to compared a combo transaction with a direct transaction.‚ÄúHi is it better to use Amaze+Privi miles combo overseas or just use Privi card straight to earn foreign spend miles?‚Äù,btohqsg
