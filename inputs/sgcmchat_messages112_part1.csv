(Yes I'm aware Steven doesn't own it),btohqsg
I guess the ONLY legal 0808 meet is by a certain group that organised once at Tuas.,btohqsg
Apart from that  whatever special meet there are are just another meet ready to be shut down by cops.,btohqsg
We nid lta to focus on the regular traffic,btohqsg
They shut down regular traffic while the higher tier cars come out to play,btohqsg
Last time 0808 only focus on Orchard. Now adays meets are popping up everywhere  TP LTA getting busier. Hahahahahahah,btohqsg
so we sacrifice the roccos and the golfs? sounds like the best trade deal ever,btohqsg
