Hi all. Anyone have plantation grove group chat?,btohqsg
Hi. I want to ask  hdb put key collection 2nd quarter of 2024 but btohq put my top completion 1 sept 2023. Mine is greenglade btw  kinda confused here,btohqsg
anyone know if income ceiling is assessed at time of application means when we pay $10 to apply for the ballot or when we book the flat?,btohqsg
Anyway anyone here is in Tampines Greenglade?,btohqsg
When you apply the bto  not the flat selection,btohqsg
Thats why they ask for your income,btohqsg
ahh ic.. i confused because at point of ballot  they never ask for verification  purely just declaration.. not like HLE when they asked for verification documents..,btohqsg
Hi guys! I am trying to upload my additional documents for my HLE application  but this keeps popping up üôÅ anyone knows why or how to fix it?,btohqsg
U try get to stable network to try,btohqsg
Called HDB and this is what they suggested  did it but the forbidden page still pops up for most HDB pages - apparently this is common for Google Chrome and Safari (according to the HDB person). The final solution I got was to google the specific link/ page I'm trying to go to  and click the page from Google Search : ) it worked but its super tedious.. just a heads up for others who may come across the same issue üôÇ,btohqsg
I use to work in so call government link organization. It is not the system garbage. It is due to the fact they want security and accountability . That why they design this way instead of usability . A upgrade cycle is always outside the commercial norm and end up the system look weird,btohqsg
Eg an upload file system will build as pull system outside the main system to avoid hacking etc . I spend a long time to figure this out as a non it person,btohqsg
Hi guys whats the diff between probable completion date ans estimated delivery posession date?,btohqsg

can i check if credit score matters if I‚Äôm taking HDB loan?,btohqsg
They ask for credit bureau report. I would think yes  it matters.,btohqsg
Must pay to get the report?,btohqsg
you can get it free if you apply for new credit cards,btohqsg
Is it when u apply for hle? When i applied for hle for my flat selection appt they nv ask me for it,btohqsg
usually credit bureau report is required if you‚Äôre self employed or you‚Äôre a business owner,btohqsg
Oic‚Ä¶ im a salaried employee with cpf contributions,btohqsg
Thank you for the clarification ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Because I got confused with the credit bureau ü•≤ cause when I apply bto that time they did not ask for this documentation ü§£,btohqsg
That one need pay $5 right,btohqsg
so if salaried with cpf means no need credit report lah,btohqsg
if they never ask for it from you  then means no need,btohqsg
i just scared if i sign up for a credit card right before loan assessment then my score will be lower,btohqsg
signing up for a credit card will not affect your credit score unless you recently apply for more than 1 credit card,btohqsg
yeah cause i did that and my score was damn shit üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
