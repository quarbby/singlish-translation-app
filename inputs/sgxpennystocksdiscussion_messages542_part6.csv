üöÄPika World Update- 29 September 2021‚öîÔ∏è‚è∞Signs of Rotation In-PlayTreasury yields are rising again after the Fed's hawkish stance improves the prospects for higher interest rates by year-end. The 10-year note had reached 1.54% on Tuesday morning  the highest level seen since June as inflation fear is back on track.The higher yield is also a reflection of better days ahead than the fear of an economic slow down due to the Delta variant. Our eye will be on the 1.75% benchmark  where it will hit the previous high.üè¶Banks: Major Beneficiary of a Higher YieldFinancials is one sector in the S&P 500 that is most correlated with long term bond yield. This is because they can borrow cheaply and lend at a higher rate; they tend to shine brighter when economic growth is robust since there is a higher chance for banks to make more profitable loans.Since 2020  the S&P 500 financial sector registered around 66% correlation with the 10-year Treasury yield. That is why Pika World is favourable for financials in the mid-cycle transition as a hedge on higher prospective rates.üöÇCapital Goods ManufacturersThe heavy capital goods manufacturer sector and energy companies tend to do well with the rise in yield too. This is not surprising given that a rosy outlook often reflects better earnings for companies such as Caterpillar (CAT)  Boeing (BA) and General Electric (GE).üöèEnergy Sector has movedWe have seen a strong performance by value stocks  mainly in the energy  financials and sectors linked to the reopening play. The power crunch that led to a hint of global energy crisis further supports the energy sector  giving the industry an invisible hand.üí°The Next HighlightTowards early summer in the US  the reflation trade and value rotation collapsed at the backdrop of the fear of the Delta variant. So now  the big question is whether these cyclical stocks can shine once more before inflation starts to choke their growth again.Pika World will cover more insights on our next move as we look forward to another profitable quarter.üì∞What's on the Menu Today?At 10 pm  we will welcome Pending Home Sales for August  which we expect to climb by 1.4% compared to -1.8% in the prior period.Next in line is Crude Oil Inventories which comes at 10.30 pm. Again  a smaller drawdown of 2.333M is expected.At 11.45 pm  Uncle Powell will continue to speaks for the second day as the market hear eagerly for the latest insight.It is 29 September  Wednesday  at 7.28 am in Singapore and 7.28 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a prosperous and energetic week ahead!,btohqsg
Updates on Hyphens Pharma ($0.305/$0.310)- price hovering above the downtrend line.For me this counter is one of my top picks especially for longer term investment. Those who can hoard counters can consider to put this in freezer. For me  within 2 years should be trading easily close to or more than 5 series. But DYODD as it is still quite illiquid.,btohqsg
