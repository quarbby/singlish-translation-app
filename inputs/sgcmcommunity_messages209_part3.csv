Hi  anyone with vezel or hr-v with this problem? Car cannot start and Battery is new and healthy. AAA came and check  battery ok. AAA did something   then he turn the steering wheel clockwise and anti clockwise. Then the car can start but the symbols still have  after drive for a while the symbols all disappeared. Was told to go ‚Äúreset‚Äù at workshop. Reset what sia?,btohqsg
Vezel/HRV is famous for Christmas lights,btohqsg
Must go workshop to reset error codes?,btohqsg
If U have the thing lor,btohqsg
Steering Lock Issue: Many cars  including the Honda Vezel and HR-V  have an electronic steering lock system. If the system malfunctions or detects an error (e.g.  improper key signal)  the car won't start. Turning the steering wheel clockwise and anti-clockwise might have disengaged the lock  allowing the car to start again.,btohqsg
Ahhh I see thank you for your reply!,btohqsg
I have another question about Honda vezel/hr-v. sometimes when I don‚Äôt turn on the automatic engine idle button  when the car is idling  suddenly when I want to drive off  the car stops  and I have to restart the car. So I have been turning on the button to turn off the automatic engine idle function. Any idea what why the car fully stop during and won‚Äôt restart during automatic engine idle is happening?,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt you bring to workshop for a proper check by the professional?,btohqsg
Check already  they said nothing wrong. Just wondering if anyone encounter similar issues  thank you,btohqsg
The idle-stop function relies on the starter motor to quickly restart the engine. A worn-out or dirty starter motor might fail to operate properly  resulting in the car stalling when u try to drive off.,btohqsg
Ahh I see  I will check this when I go workshop thank you!,btohqsg
Why you using my father picture,btohqsg
I like the NTUC link points,btohqsg

I already sat on both versions,btohqsg
Come out always bang head against doorframe..,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt like the third gen because of the narrow field of vision,btohqsg
I think if my family had kept the RV Vezel  might need to consider wearing helmet..,btohqsg
I 176 no prob getting in out,btohqsg
I also do consider getting the Yaris‚Äôs Cross but there are also things I don‚Äôt like about it,btohqsg
50-50 or long leg  short torso?,btohqsg
The signal lights are super irritating  sounds like a child‚Äôs toy,btohqsg
Cus I short leg  big torso  so bang head against door frame üòÖ,btohqsg
Anyways  if I would buy a car. Definitely a simple car like a Swift,btohqsg
Since those are the only 2 generations available,btohqsg
This newest generation. Many say it looks uglier than the outgoing model,btohqsg
I think the A2L is slightly nicer,btohqsg
If you consider  got alvin if got things to ask,btohqsg
Handling of that car is nice too. I already driven several cars at this point liao,btohqsg
