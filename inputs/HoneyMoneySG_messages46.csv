If u use Apple Pay to pay for your diningat the counterin a restaurant  it is Mobile Contactless. If u order food and pay byscanning a qr codein a restaurant  it is online transaction even though you are using Apple Pay.,btohqsg
i thought evol is either online or contactless only,btohqsg
U can go branch to terminate earmark but u will lose all rewards.,btohqsg
Any recommend card to pay about $2.8k of insurance? Insurance doesn‚Äôt accept Amex which was my initial intention :(,btohqsg
Im a apple user and hence cannot add amaze to the apple wallet. If i add citi rewards to the apple pay wallet and use it for kris+ app payment at participating partners  is it considered as an online spend and will earn 10x rewards?,btohqsg
Was just going to ask this..,btohqsg
Realised his amaze payment only works on android phones,btohqsg
Which credit card to use to pay aia insurance via aia app ?,btohqsg

Income tax season. Watched Chris video couple of times.Dear gurus  what's the best option for this case? 200k taxes to pay  prepared cash to pay one shot.What is the best case to get something out of it?Seems like Citi pay all is 120k cap.Also if using credit card for such  does it mean the credit limit must be raised above the one off income tax payment via citi pay all?Thanks.,btohqsg
If requesting for credit limit increase (temporarily or permanently) fails you can just prepay the amount into your card,btohqsg
I think I can do that. Assuming 120k limit of citi pay all  am I right to say pay citi 2.2% then suck thumb that the cap earned is 120k yet transaction is 2.2% of 200k?,btohqsg
Sir  if you are paying $200K tax  I suggest you join ACCM to not miss out on the $80K,btohqsg
Sir  how to? Me noob....hehehe....and deadline near,btohqsg
200k income tax. Wow. At least $1m income per year.,btohqsg
Can share which bank and what card?,btohqsg
UOB and you will need to spend 6.5k so i skipping totally,btohqsg
120k = 2.2% citipayall80k = 1.75% cardup,btohqsg
why do u want to pay one shot? you can always set up giro and then intercept the payments before deduction.,btohqsg
Me noob lah. Past years always pay 1 shot. Never get anything out of it,btohqsg
I thought UOB has a condition indicated that you must have not cancelled your card within 6  months or 12 months?,btohqsg
I wouldnt be trying anymore. so yah,btohqsg
This year is different because bank interest rates are so high. Making use of the interest free 12 months instalment plan is a must!,btohqsg
Moomoo cash plus  ok for parking trading money?,btohqsg
Yes I did that.For those of us investing in US market and funding SGD  do NOT to convert to USD before the daily cut off time for automatic 'money sweep' to Fullerton SGD Cash Fund. Otherwise  need to perform fund redemption and wait for cash or deposit fresh SGD.,btohqsg
Is that mean we need to have 120k credit limit with Citi  or payall doesn‚Äôt count to our credit limit?,btohqsg
What is the difference between syfe n endowus,btohqsg
Sorry  can explain what the recommended procedure.  Tks,btohqsg
Personally  I see 3 key differences. Rest of the folks pls chime in based on your views too.1. Endowus provide retail investors with access to institutional class of mutual funds (aka unit trusts) which is usually off limit (to retail investors) such as Dimensional.2. Endowus refunds trailer fees paid by fund managers of mutual funds for selling their funds (commission) back to us.3. Syfe provides retail investors direct access to ETF through its curated portfolio.Key similarity:We pay mgmt fees based on our AUM to both Endowus and Syfe.,btohqsg
What markets r u planning to invest in with moomoo? What currency u planning to fund your account?,btohqsg
Currency u will be funding your account? SGD or USD?,btohqsg
That is what I don't understand.  Which is recommended.,btohqsg
Sorry to confuse you. Moomoo allows clients to deposit USD directly.For you  probably u would be depositing SGD into your account.Invest US market: If u have subscribed to moomoo Cashplus and enable automatic invest  u need to convert your SGD to USD before 8 am the next day.Invest SG market: No action required on your part if the shares are priced in SGD (only a handful are priced in US Dollar).,btohqsg
Hi morning guys  deciding between yuu amex and yuu visa  what's the disadvantage of yuu amex? Anyone pls advice?,btohqsg

Hey all  don't know why but OCBC rejected my titanium application 3 times already  my credit rating is perfect and I don't have any problems applying with all the other banks  when I contacted OCBC  they couldn't tell me why  will going down to their physical branch to enquire be my best option now? Any suggestions on how to get accepted?,btohqsg
I guess they know something abt you which you may not even know yourself or are hiding it ü§î,btohqsg
Move on lo  titanium rewards also not the best card to have also.If other banks also reject then maybe something wrong,btohqsg
Just wanted the first time sign up bonus hahaha,btohqsg
Other banks nvr reject  or maybe it's because I signed up for 7 cards from 7 different banks in the past 9 months?,btohqsg
Same issue for me. UOB rejected me,btohqsg
Hihi  May I check  if I pair instarem amaze card with uob lady's card and make hotel transaction in sg  will I earn insta points?,btohqsg
Hi  new to the group: what would be the best all rounder cashback card?,btohqsg
"I think he mispelled ""all rounder""",btohqsg
Yes i did lol  and edit the post :),btohqsg
cards with higher cashback %  have more restrictions. So need to know what u spend on and how much,btohqsg
Maybe 20 k a month  10 on rental 5 on lifestyle  5 on airplane. Travel a lot abroad,btohqsg
Restaurants  foods  bag and cloths for girlfriends,btohqsg
Hi all wish to check what‚Äôs the best card for furniture purchase,btohqsg
hi all  going on exchange soon  will be flying around quite abit  wanna get some financial tips,btohqsg

Thanks a lot for the reco,btohqsg
What would you like to know more about?,btohqsg
Need to spread across few cards if you intend to maximise the cashback or miles.,btohqsg
Is the yuu card / membership any good?,btohqsg
Yes i see they are all capped ! Is mileage a better deal than cash back then?,btohqsg
With 20k per month  that is $240k per year  right?,btohqsg
Can I buy Fraser giftcard and capital mall vouchers using Citi cashback card? Eligible spending for both? Thanks!,btohqsg
Not worth. U should wait for sale and use grab or capita Amex respectively.,btohqsg
I need to pay kid's tuition at Fraser mall üòÇ...,btohqsg
When got grab promo  I got topped up too...,btohqsg
If urgent u could try buying With cash at carousel. Surely better than 1.6% discount.,btohqsg
Like to check  to calculate hsbc ega‚Äôs bonus interest rate  i will need to use the daily balance over 30/ 31 days vs prior to the first month I opened the acct?For eg  opened acct in Jun  the average daily balance of Jun vs May acct balance which is 0. And in Jul  the average daily balance vs. May acct balance 0. And the total bonus interest will be credited in Nov.that‚Äôs what the customer svc person told me,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt plan to spread the expenses across few cards  you may want to explore Amex TCB or UOB absolute for cashback.If you plan to get miles using one card  you can explore UOB Krisflyer.If you are ok with few cards to maximise the rewards  it is a very long long long story.üòÅ,btohqsg
Thanks a lot ill look around and mix and match i guess,btohqsg
Cashback card need to spend $800 every mth rite? So such gift card spending can clock towards the $800? Bcoz dining and grocery categories  I may not spend $800/mth.,btohqsg
No la. Please don‚Äôt use Citi cashback to buy Fraser or capita. U get pittance. Buy ntuc vouchers if u have problem hitting $800.,btohqsg
Who doesn‚Äôt go ntuc. And u can use them in Ang baos too (ok this is a joke).,btohqsg
Maybe just a summary of amaze card? I cant seem to fully understand how it works and how good is it compared to youtrip,btohqsg

Hi All  need your advise and thank you so much taking time reading this. Anyone are foreigners but holding a sg credit card? I have a Philippino friend who is getting a new home. She will spend alot on big items. She is working in sg. Also her expenses in sg is very minimal. So perhaps after buying all big items she will back to her usual spending pattern and preferred no minimum spending.,btohqsg
What is your question? üßê u got credit limit just use lah,btohqsg
She wanted to apply a credit card in sg that has no minimum spending and yet will earn some rewards to spend on big items for her house in Philippines.,btohqsg
Any recommendation of which card to get?,btohqsg
Any idea when HSBC revo bonus points will be credited?,btohqsg
Mine still seem like 1pt per dollar,btohqsg
For ocbc saving account such as 360  can we set sms notification for incoming $ such as salary,btohqsg
Noted u r quite specific in the purpose for the ocbc titanium (new notebook). U might want to apply one last time and specify that u ask for $5000 credit. If that doesn't help  see other card bah,btohqsg
How can you check if your card is still earning boosted points? Example Citi rewards is 1k monthly cap for 4mpd. How to know if you‚Äôve already earned the max  since not all transactions will earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
This is competitor review wor  can post here meh,btohqsg
Capita not  fraser should be yes,btohqsg

I‚Äôm trying to say there are things in life which simply favour the rich (or employed and drawing salary),btohqsg
Well you just assume too much my friend. Chris knows me abit better. The reason I'm not drawing a salary is because of tax reasons and I will leave it at that,btohqsg
Got a lot of debit cards that have cashback with minimum spend. Not as good as CCs but better than nothing,btohqsg
what do you mean? Cashback is a benefit,btohqsg
Min spend is a pain. I want something like Amex TCB no min spend,btohqsg
If your monthly min spend cannot even hit those amounts  then probably you don't really need a credit card anyway. The rewards aren't that great  especially if like you said you're saving on taxes..Amex TCB is 1.5% cashback only  if you cannot hit 500 or 600 a month your max cashback a month only around $5-10Just weigh your cost and benefit  i'm sure saving on income tax is definitely better than any reward you can get haha,btohqsg

For accounts like Bonus + Savings account  u can have as many as six (6) joint account holders. But all account holders need to be physically present at the branch to open the account.,btohqsg
I done that already but it didn‚Äôt say much (with Amaze) and I thought this will be eligible since it‚Äôs not part of exclusion I suppose since fwd is not entirely under travel but just insurance.,btohqsg

Hi  I'm trying to figure out how Kris+ app works after watching Chris' recent video. It is not a wallet so this means if I use Kris+ app to pay  do I need to link it to my Google Pay? Which in turn my G Pay is linked to my credit card?I have a UOB KrisFlyer CC and it has 1500 KrisPay miles as sign on bonus. I need to spend min $5 via Google Pay via Kris+ app. Question is  payment made through such method  does it change the MCC code of the merchant? I'm planning to spend on dinning.,btohqsg
If pay in foreign exchange currency which credit card better? Or just use youtrip or amaze or revolt better?,btohqsg
yes  scan kris+ QR  pay using card in google pay linked to Kris+. No change to MCC.,btohqsg

Hi shifu. For those that sign up for UOB Prvi. The two consecutive months need to be two full months apart or as long it‚Äôs different months  it works?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm surprised u said that. My experience is most cards are ok for dentist.It‚Äôs hospitals that are excluded.,btohqsg
If it is a dental clinic within a hospital  it‚Äôs MCC likely is 8062 n excluded.If it is NDCS or those private clinics such as Q&M  its MCC is 8021. DBS Livefresh or UOB PPV should be ok. If you decide to use UOB EVOL  remember to use ApplePay or GooglePay because EVOL Visa Paywave contactless only give 0.3%. Instead of 6.67%(8%).,btohqsg
Hi this is UOB quarterly rebate chart. I not very sure but i think it means every 3 month we receive $50 if we spend above $500 for 3 month?,btohqsg
Then why people use UOB 1 card? OCBC every month can collect $80. 3 months means OCBC can collect $240 whereas UOB collect only $50,btohqsg
What is this link/page? Looks wrong? $300 per quarter?,btohqsg
This seems outdated and already replaced.,btohqsg
$80 for which ocbc card? limited category spending? higher min spend requirement?Anyway uob one card can get bonus cashback for specific merchants. And clocks to card spend for bonus interest on uob one account.,btohqsg

Ok thanks. I just realised the PDF i looking was 2015,btohqsg
Hi seems like the quarter rebate is still $50 if we spend $500 for 3 months for UOB card.Whereas OCBC we need to spend $800 for max $80 rebate for each month.,btohqsg
no lah  need to spend more than $800 to get $80  not 10% rebate lah,btohqsg

Do u have Singpass Mobile (SPM) MyInfo? With SPM MyInfo  u might get instant approval from UOB.,btohqsg
I went through the same issue. Just drop an email to UOB CS. They will get the relevant department to assist you but the process will take quite awhile.,btohqsg
Yeah amaze rates are among the worst now because it allows u to earn your usual MasterCard rewards still + 1% amaze rebate.,btohqsg
I use Trust BankI am glad Trust Bank is the first that gives 0% foreign exchange fees. Low rewards then low rewards lor.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I thought so too. Until I went to compare with revolut and Wise,btohqsg

For savings accounts like UOB One and OCBC 360  the crediting of salary component  can it just be done as if you‚Äôre transferring money from one account into that savings account? Or has to be an official credit by your employer,btohqsg
UOB One people in this group were able to transfer from DBS by selecting salary. If some day the bank wants to validate the credit received then they possibly take back the interest amount so just be careful  its fraud in a way.,btohqsg
interesting. i'd assume the banks know about this loophole but close one eye cus at the end of the day its about putting money into their banks,btohqsg
Hello  gurus. I have set up giro payment for my scb credit cards as it shown on the statement  I am wondering how long it takes to deduct from my HSBC account? The money is not deducted by my statement date starts from 16th May.,btohqsg
Agree in a way. As long as they don‚Äôt take the interest credited back it should be fine,btohqsg
dont think they will take it back. they themselves updated their website to say they will accept it as salary crediting as long as you put the reference as salary. im thinking they just want to capture more market share thats all,btohqsg
Wow you got any link where it says to be acceptable?,btohqsg
its on their uob one page. you go see  there is a banner about halfway through the page that says they updated to accept this mode of crediting in december. so im quite sure they are aware that it would be used this way and allow it,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need to be scared. Worst case is they nerf it. As in don‚Äôt recognise the fake salary credit anymore. They won‚Äôt ask u to pay back the interest already given.,btohqsg
good way to target self-employed tbh. if not the self-employed market segment totally cant use this,btohqsg
These are their T&Cs as of December 2022. FAST SALA is excluded. But because PayNow is a layer above FAST  and given how banks implement their checking  hay production happens.,btohqsg
And uob already knows for sure. Because many people already call into uob cso to ask them if they pay their own family members can or not.Just whether uob want to patch their criteria or not.,btohqsg
how u know many ppl called?,btohqsg
I in quite a lot of group chats‚Ä¶..,btohqsg
this type of thing just do..  dont need to keep asking for official black and white one...,btohqsg
PAYNOW SALA seems the best option from other family member or friend account. FAST excluded.,btohqsg
I agree  no need to call CS. Many people in this group alr got interest credited.,btohqsg
alamak here la guys. they recently considered it eligible so im sure they are letting us do this,btohqsg
People have been doing FAST SALA. Point made was FAST SALA =/= PayNow SALA.,btohqsg
same same but different no? main thing is that whether its a loophole or not  and it seems that uob is allowing it to happen on purpose so just enjoy,btohqsg
It‚Äôs likely loose programming with unintended result.,btohqsg
does not matter so long reflected in tracker and get the interest,btohqsg
what matters more is people don't call banks to ask,btohqsg
could be intentional also  to target the group of people who are more conscious and will otherwise choose to put the money in other banks,btohqsg
not sure on the specifics of programming  even if it is they are embracing it by explicitly saying that its accepted,btohqsg
Then they might as well accept fast in like hsbc.,btohqsg
so that it will be a deliberate action,btohqsg
If it is salary. That is the main point.,btohqsg
many promos are like this. they don't just open to everyone automatically. they only open it to those who know and opted in. this is so that they will not end up spending money on people that doesn't care anyway.,btohqsg
capture market share lor. especially those who dont have the usual giro salary by hr. those are lost sheeps and maybe uob wants to take them in. or those that max out the real salary crediting threshold with their bank and looking to get more  uob also take in,btohqsg
yah I think to target those that max out at OCBC already. I'm one of those. haha.,btohqsg
without the paynow method  I will withdraw the 100k from UOB and put into HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
yup so i strongly believe they are aware and also welcome us to do this,btohqsg
take your 100k give you 5% then charge borrowers more. huat ah,btohqsg
Wondering why without the paynow method in UOB then u will put in HSBC EGA. I tht HSBC EGA has a higher interest rate at 5.3% as compared to UOB One at 5%,btohqsg
"I don't like the HSBC EGA ""uncertainty"" as you are assured of the amount received only few months later. So I prefer to max out OCBC and UOB first.",btohqsg

According to t and c  the 1% is on incremental amount from previous month  and capped at $300. Hence 5.7% not accurate  ‚Äúup to‚Äù is what the bank used. I think one of us already getting max $300 every month  please search for the Sifu üëçüèª,btohqsg

To clarify  this is solely for mobile payment. Physical card is fine too.,btohqsg

It‚Äôs good you are aiming higher at this stage  just keep an open mind  that not everyone will realise the benefits as early as you do. Everyone learns and grow at their own pace and better to learn someday than never learn it.That being said some basic tips for <18yo:- Find a part time job to earn some allowances for yourself  esp between sch hols. Tuition  retail  fnb whatever you are comfortable with.- Have good saving and spending habits.- Start researching up on investments  bonds etc. Chris‚Äô videos are useful for that. Once you hit the legal age and have some capital  you can start dabbling in them. (Depending on your risk appetite)- Live within your means will do.,btohqsg

there's opportunity cost to wait. if you think the card suits you suggest not to wait. HSBC don't usually have very attractive signup gifts.,btohqsg
I agree with this view completely. We should not apply for the sake of free gifs. If the card does not suit our usage cases or we are not prepared to pay annual fees  I would give the card  a miss regardless how good the rewards are.But  if we need a specific credit card (e.g dbs world woman card) for a spending next year  we can probably want to apply for the card next year.,btohqsg

are you using the cpf funds for anything else? or just left in oa,btohqsg
left in OA  not using for anything else,btohqsg
so which is why i was thinking of doing prepayment (which goes directly into principal)  as opposed to monthly mortgage (which goes into both the principal and interest component for the mortgage),btohqsg
then my stand is pay up. accrued interest seem irrelevant because you are putting the money back into your own oa,btohqsg

Hello  I use the Citibank rewards + amaze strategy  but for additional (above the citi limits) and travel spends I have been using the DBS Woman card.

Has anyone faced this already? Seems quite a downside. Was thinking to give up on the miles accumulated on it over the past months and move to another card. I have never been charged fees for those types of purchases on other cards before. üòï,btohqsg

Hi I am comparing Maybank FD 3.9% 12mths and DBS shares. I see they say DBS pay abou 4.95%,btohqsg
Hi  from my experience  it does slightly. According to my CBS report  it dipped to 1927 when I was in a flurry of signing up a few credit cards last year. Based on my last check early this year  after a few timely payments  it had returned to 2000 (the full score). My credit score remained in the AA range throughout though (1911-2000) and I nv missed a payment.To answer your question  it may not be so direct. Does it affect the score? yes. Does it affect affect the overall grading? No in my case. If it concerns you  has it affected my banking facility  credit and loan limits with my bank? No too.Hope the above helps.,btohqsg
Hi  newbie here... May I know how do we know our credit score? Is it free to get the score?,btohqsg

Yeah existing member i think they dont  coz just draw dwn on existing limits right,btohqsg
I believe all 3 credit cards are sharing same credit limits. Hence  no impact on the bank.,btohqsg

yes my brain is now thinking of all the new possibilities üòÑ,btohqsg
is there a cap on the 1% ?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not from the bank. CBS is independent. Google CBS  then enter your details. At the payment part  just click the button. If you have a free report  they will give you for free.,btohqsg
thank you so much for sharing the steps. first time seeing my own credit report. really appreciate the sharing in this grp very much! üôè,btohqsg
Something must have gone very wrong to drop from AA to EE just over many applications. I‚Äôve applied for 3 cards from 3 different banks over the course of 2 months  score barely dipped to BB.,btohqsg
i second you... i don't think application for multiple cards would drop by so much.From my understanding  the biggest factor that will cause u to have lousy scores is if you are late in making payments.All others have negligible effect (at most drop 1 notch).,btohqsg
some people believe that if you pay bills before the statement is generated it will negatively affect your score too,btohqsg
This is rubbish that isn‚Äôt applicable to our Singapore CBS system. Cannot just blindly apply wholesale what you watch from YouTube videos meant for a US audience.,btohqsg
you mean it's true for US?,btohqsg
Yes. Cause they want to see credit usage. If you pay before the bill is generated  I think their system doesn‚Äôt capture,btohqsg
the video i saw for US is that their version of CBS retrieves credit details from lenders on fixed date of the month  so people pay the day before so that it seems they dont owe money/owe less,btohqsg

The TnC document of the promotion have a list of all excluded transactions. Capitaland vouchers confirm don't count. Giant vouchers you can try buy together with some other items and double check if get any yuu points. If get  then high chance it's counted as valid spend. Although i suggest better not to since vouchers are listed as exclusion. If you have singtel bills to pay  can pay at singtel self service kiosks at singtel physical shops.,btohqsg
Confirm can get 4mpd with crmc direct. No need to link with amaze.,btohqsg

Question to the Mile Enthusiasts here who have the UOB One Account  how do you segregate your expenses in the UOB cards to fulfil the minimum spend of $500 while ensuring you don't lose out on the potential miles,btohqsg
But do take note usd cheque account may need to maintain min balance and varies from bank to bank. Of course nothing stopping you from opening the account  issue the cheque and close it.,btohqsg

GIRO setup completed does not mean your current bill will be paid via GIRO. It depends on when the bill is generated  before or after GIRO setup.To know if your bill will be auto paid via GIRO. Check your bill  there should have a word or sentence printed on the bill to indicate it is to be paid via GIRO.If your bill is generated before giro setup with due date after giro setup  this bill will not be paid via giro.,btohqsg
If there is no GIRO indicated on the bill  you better quickly pay manually to avoid late payment charges.,btohqsg

I think if you are paying for your CareShield Life and Integrated Shield Plan using MA its worth doing VCMA before RSTU.This means that you are basically using cash to pay the premiums for both  and then getting a tax deduction.This is of course  compared to RSTU where you can do SA shielding (or if not trying to game the system)  SA->RA to pay for your CPF Life annuity premium,btohqsg

i see ‚Äúnerf‚Äù used a lot. may i know what exactly does it mean in those financial context? tx in advance!,btohqsg
Means the rewards use to be very powerful.When it gets nerfed means it‚Äôs not so powerful nowIt‚ÄôsMore of a game term,btohqsg
Eg. Gun A used to do 5 damage to enemies  now Gun A only does 3 damage to enemies after the latest game update. Gun A has been nerfed.Last time credit card A gave 5% cashback  now credit card A only gives 3% cashback. Credit card A has been nerfed.,btohqsg
"The term ""nerf"" is often used in the context of gaming and refers to reducing the power  effectiveness  or strength of a particular item  ability  character  or game element. When something is ""nerfed "" it means it has been intentionally weakened or toned down in order to balance the game or address issues of imbalance or unfairness. The term originates from the brand name ""Nerf "" which is a popular line of foam-based toys and sports equipment known for being safe and less likely to cause harm or damage. In gaming  ""nerfing"" is akin to softening or cushioning the impact of a specific feature to maintain a more balanced and enjoyable experience for all players. In finance  it's not appropriate to be used. Likely someone used it and the others blindly follow.",btohqsg

"is instarem amaze + Citi rewards still the better use for overseas spending (e.g. dining overseas) over youtrip despite the ""from 1% fx spread""?",btohqsg
travel related MCCs e.g  hotel excluded from 4mpd,btohqsg
That's what I plan to do even though I have YouTrip and Trust Card. I plan to use these two for hotel payments overseas because Amaze CRMC combo won't earn points for hotel,btohqsg
What's the FX spread that Instarem Amaze charges now? 2%?,btohqsg
I think it's between 1.5 -2%so I'm not sure if this fx spread is worth paying for just to earn 4mpd + instarem pointsor perhaps just better off locking in good youtrip rates,btohqsg
You should go watch YouTube video by Chris. Idea is even if we are paying 2% FX spread  as long as the CC rewards are greater than this spread  net net we still earn. youtrip doesn't have rewards,btohqsg
I'm also topping up YouTrip slowly because JPY is really weak against SGD. So this is more like locking in good rate as you mentioned. Whereas CC overseas spend is taking rate on the spot. I may end up being sucker for doing You trip exchange now if JPY is super weak by the time I travel to Japan.,btohqsg
Depends how much u are spending  in the end fluctuations in FX doesn‚Äôt amount to much when it comes to personal expenses,btohqsg
Approx 2.5% above interbank fx ratesApprox 1.75% above MasterCard fx rates.,btohqsg
It's for sure that Bonus Interest rates have been coming down for recent months. So I would expect next month to continue the downtrend. Whether it's wise to do so  need a crystal ball on future rates 4 months later.,btohqsg

so is there a time limit to hit the 2000 instapoints? eg. the points expire?,btohqsg

i see. thanks.so will have to consider whether my spending will hit 2k in 6 months to be able to enjoy the 1% benefit and whether without this 1%  does the credit card rewards still outweigh the 2% FX spread compared to youtrip with lower FX spread and zero rewards,btohqsg
