I think they look at the overall percentage for prelim instead of L1R5But it depends on the sch avg performance,btohqsg
Do u think it may be top 25%?,btohqsg
I got unlimted data for $18 but its awhile back alr,btohqsg
like i said bfr ut depends on how ur schoolmate perform for prelims,btohqsg
but if u get before 13 dec then it probably means u got it alr,btohqsg
if after then i guess lower chance,btohqsg

a tiktoker went to psa and got a card graded for 10 and he got that card for $45. From that he made a $900 profit,btohqsg
also what card important  if charizard and one of the first one psa grade 10 will go from tens of thousands easily,btohqsg
I was watching a few streamers just now and they ranged from like $400 to a few thousand,btohqsg
He pulled a holo charizard but people are saying its psa 9,btohqsg
Yeah there was something on the top left on the back they said,btohqsg
Psa 10 and psa 9 price tag difference very large haha,btohqsg
