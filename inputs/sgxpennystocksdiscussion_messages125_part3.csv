Cafe Pho is a top-seller for Food Empire. The stock has the greatest upside potential among UOB KH's alpha picks.,btohqsg
32 is the key if clear then at least 34 35,btohqsg
Cnmc will run first. Reason  report coming out soon. Previous one they report a loss because of mco. Now back in firing with higher gold price. We should expect 0.36 in the short term,btohqsg
Japfa outperformed on the back of its strong set of 3Q20 results  while top decliners were CapitaLand Mall Trust  Wilmar and YZJ,btohqsg
Just keep on around 590 to 610 range,btohqsg
Resilient product offering and strong brand equity. Given the low price  relativelyinelastic and consumer-staple nature of its products  Food Empire is likely to be moreresilient and sheltered from an economic slowdown  in our view. Additionally  we highlightthat in spite of the weaker ruble against the US dollar  the group has managed to mitigatesome of the adverse impact on bottom line through gradual increases in ASP  which helpedto boost gross margin in 2Q20 by 1.4ppt. We are encouraged by the group’s ability to passon cost and report a decent set of 2Q20 results amid the lockdown. We believe this is atestament to its strong brand equity in its core markets that has been developed over manyyears.• Compelling valuation. At the current price  Food Empire trades at 8.4x 2021F PE  asignificant discount compared to >20x for its regional peers. Target Price $0.85,btohqsg
Anyways I go celebrate friend bday. You guys enjoy a good time trading.,btohqsg
