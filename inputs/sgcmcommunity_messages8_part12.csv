https://shopee.sg/product/68876894/17231819642?smtt=0.7011164-1650337383.9Tng x Ez link. In stock now. $10 !,btohqsg
üëçüèªThanks bro  always sold out. Finally can place order,btohqsg
dont give too much high hope. i ordered it previously and ezlink shopee never delivered. the order was auto cancelled.chat is not responsive and Ezlink says the assigned merchant in shopee is not their responsibility.in the end  i visited more than 20 places to get hold of 1 ezlink tng card.,btohqsg
You still don't have your free tow?,btohqsg
They credited it the very next day. If you still don't have it under the coupon tab in your profile  please let us know and we'll forward your details to TowMe,btohqsg
Please correct me if I'm wrong. There's no value in this ezlink x TnG card  making it useless for border crossing?,btohqsg
Cross border by Foot ? Top up next entry by car? Easy,btohqsg
Should compare with model s as the omv is around there hehe,btohqsg
nobody outside singapore cares about omv. it is about performance,btohqsg
does anyone know where in genting lane i can find engine oils like castrol mobil1 etc,btohqsg
i forgot the name of the shop i went last time,btohqsg
Hidden Gem Genting lane sia lol,btohqsg
haha somewhere inside those flatted factories i thin,btohqsg
do y9ou know the shop around genting lane,btohqsg
U sure   is only Singapore car is is expensive,btohqsg
look at power. tesla 3 performance is quite equal,btohqsg
Model s is the signature like m series,btohqsg
The slowest model s is also faster then model 3 performance,btohqsg
But for red light dashing model 3 is more then enoigh,btohqsg
Just get Plaid Version Come sg i think 500k,btohqsg
in germany  bmw M always trails porsche in performance and ratings,btohqsg
As the distance is so short,btohqsg
but gasoline cars cant beat EV. EV is instant torque,btohqsg
useless? better than no card at all! it is so hard to just get one card.,btohqsg
There's function called top up mah.. even for cash card  also need top up b4 use,btohqsg
Thanks for bringing this up. Where can one top up the TnG card in Singapore?,btohqsg
But a card with 0 balance won't get you through the CIQ either.,btohqsg
The top-up done in Singapore will be in SGD into your SGD purse and the funds can only be used in Singapore. The funds will not be auto-converted to Malaysian Ringgit.The EZ-Link x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring Card holds two electronic purses within one card and funds are not transferable between the purses.,btohqsg
Please note that there are 2 purses contained within the EZL x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring card. Top-up channels for the individual purses are as below:Topping up in SingaporePlease top up the EZ-Link purse of your EZ-Link x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring Card at 7-Eleven outlets  DBS/POSB ATMs  OCBC ATMs and AXS Stations that accept EZ-Link card payments. Top-up fees apply at certain top-up channels.You may also top up the EZ-Link purse of your EZ-Link x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring Card via the Express Top-up service on the EZ-Link app. Please note that Auto Top-up is not applicable for the EZ-Link x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring Card.Topping up in MalaysiaPlease find the nearest locations to top-up the Touch ‚Äôn Go purse of your EZ-Link x Touch ‚Äòn Go Motoring Card in this link:https://www.touchngo.com.my/consumer/toll/card/reload-your-card/*Please note that top-ups are not available at all 7-Eleven outlets in Malaysia.,btohqsg
clearly u didnt read the news. ciq has top up till 30 apr only. u should be thankful if u can get hold of 1 tng card. many people have to go melaka and kl and buy one.,btohqsg
when u buy nets cashcard in sg. also sgd0 mah. what's so useless about RM0 tng card? lol.,btohqsg
Does sgcarmart have a platform for car insurance?,btohqsg
Thank you for the information. That is awesome. I genuinely did not read about that.,btohqsg
I believe that the question is valid because a TnG card that can not be revalued prior to entering the CIQ is basically a paperweight.,btohqsg
May I know how to pm u?,btohqsg
Thanks for the tip. Have you been successful with the app?,btohqsg
So far seems ok.. able to top up my ezlink cards,btohqsg
I thought it cybertruck then is tough,btohqsg
Dunno real or not‚Ä¶ so tough‚Ä¶?,btohqsg
Maybe they really use Vibranium for the car body‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Ev are heavier so during a crash got advantage,btohqsg
go via 2nd link  got tng hired part timer holding machine to assist with top up  pay via CC.,btohqsg
Sweet! Did some nosing about and I don't think the app supports TnG top ups. Thanks for sharing nonetheless.,btohqsg
only the new tng white card with the wifi icon is able to support top up via NFC enabled phone thru tng app. any other card will have to go through the traditional method of topping up.,btohqsg
How can we get rid of scams fast enough,btohqsg
