Thomson Medical (Now $0.051) should get more interesting in my opinion. collected some at $0.050 recently. the last spike up went to 0.054 before retracing to $0.049/$0.050.- current price range supported by short term  upwards trend line- 'CB Babies theme' that BBs and P.L guys might 'fry'?- Expect Thomson medical to be doing well this period due to more babies this period due to Circuit Breaker where working couples have more time at home for making babies during CB.- I believe earlier on when they spike up to $0.054 was accumulation. They should have something in the plans.,btohqsg
