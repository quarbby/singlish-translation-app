When you get a queue number  the individual unit pricing for the project will be shown so that you know how much to pay when going down to book flat,btohqsg
1. I'll skip since it has been answered2. All prices would fall within the range of the indicative price  just at what end of the spectrum  depending on many factors including floor #*If you opt in to OCS of course it would be additional cost (alr stated in project page),btohqsg

Hi  can i check;1) if we apply for BTO and got balloted  can we still apply for SOB at the same time?,btohqsg
Can provided that your BTO queue number is out of supply. If it is out of supply  whichever queue number comes first  you have to pick.,btohqsg
Unless your BTO Q is out of Q then u can apply for next launch,btohqsg
Everything can find online please go check.,btohqsg
Note that you can be included in multiple priority schemes should you fulfil the eligibility criteria across the schemes. For instance  for a first timer married couple balloting for a flat within 4km to their parent's place  you will be eligible for the FPPS and MCPS priority schemes which sets aside a total of 70% of the flat supply for you. In this case:1. You will first ballot for a queue number within the flat supply under the FPPS scheme where 40% of supply is set aside for FPPS applicants.2. If you fail in the FPPS ballot  you will move on to participate in the MCPS ballot where 30% of supply is set aside for MCPS applicants.3. Failing to ballot under the FPPS and MCPS  you will then ballot for around 20% of the remaining supply  together with the general public with no priority and those who failed in the priority ballots üòä,btohqsg
For MCPS  you will only qualify for this if you have opt-in when submitting your application and also have either of your/your partner's parents residing within 4km distance to any of the 3 bedok BTO projects. This will entitle you to participate in an additional ballot where 30% of the flats are set aside  giving you a higher chance of securing a queue number within the flat supply. Unlike MGPS  MCPS ballots are part of the public scheme and there are no restrictions on the flats you can choose. üòÄ,btohqsg
A quick summary on flats set aside under the common priority schemes for first timers  where 95% of flat supply is set aside:MGPS Scheme - Flats reserved for this is computed as 15% of number of 2 and 3 room flats  subject to a minimum of 20 flatsTCPS Scheme - 5%FPPS Scheme - 40% (FT(PMC) applicants will qualify for this)MCPS Scheme - 30% (Around 20% for PLH flat)More information on priority schemes are availablehere.,btohqsg
All the information u need is actually on HDB‚Äôs website  if u read thoroughly,btohqsg
With All  the Priority scheme and with The Additional Lucky Draw chance ..some given 2 chance or 3 chance in the ballot boxIs Still a Lucky Draw by chance regarding how many we have for our extra  tickets in the box ?Sometimes a Single ticket can strike the lottery ...is this how it is going to beOr it will be unfair advantage set aside for certain Priority more priority than other priorities scheme ?I am curious how the Ballot would be and the Q number ..who is the first Q1 to 10  to choose ...,btohqsg
95% is set aside for those with Priority scheme...?5% left for those with No Priority Scheme ?,btohqsg
The meant game over for me..I belong to the 5%Whoever that 5% got it is strike the lottery...Good luck to all,btohqsg
Btw  chance of getting your name drawn =/= how good your queue number will be,btohqsg
So could be that you're a lucky 2nd timer who gets a very good queue number,btohqsg
