Hi Chris  for Revolut 20% cashback promo for MRT rides  understand from their terms and conditions that need to transfer $100 via bank transfer each month to enjoy the 20% cashback for that month.Do you know if I still can qualify for the cashback if at the end of the month I withdraw all the money inside the Revolut account? Then the next month transfer $100 again‚Ä¶and repeat this cycle till December since the promotion is running till 31st Dec 2021.,btohqsg

Hi all  any idea why I can‚Äôt see the bank details on Revolut app for top up via bank transfer?,btohqsg
Is the account number my Revolut card number?,btohqsg
Revolut homepage > add money > change to bank transfer,btohqsg
I clicked that and showing the same detail. No account number,btohqsg
Another way is click your on your name at top left Revolut homepage > documents > account confirmation,btohqsg
Use the one with DBS Account number,btohqsg

REVOLUT NEW USER sign-up bonus is back again! Expire 4 Aug 2021Refer to my UOB ABSOLUTE CARD video to see how you could get 21.7% cashback off your SimplyGo Transit rides!Sign-up linkhttps://revolut.com/referral/waikitvd1g!jul1agg,btohqsg
Chris  would u recommend the hsbc revolution card?,btohqsg
Yes  it is on par with UOB PPV at 4mpd.But I'm not so into miles accumulation now due to travel restrictions,btohqsg
It‚Äôs also able to earn reward points to offset spending. Do u think the 10x reward points is more value as compared with mainstream cash back cards? 1 thing that attracts me to the card is the no annual fee,btohqsg
In ny opinion  10x reward points are most optimized to redeem for Miles for the best value. Redeeming it for anything else e.g. cash  vouchers will just diminish its value and will be better if you just use a 5%/6% cashback card.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  thank you for sharing ! For the 4 Aug expiry is it for the sign up bonus or the 20% cashback? Any idea when the cashback will last... Cuz i cant seem to find a page on it ^^,btohqsg

Hi guys  just want some opinions or ideas on how to save up for a HDB for a single by 35 (currently 26)? Would a voluntary CPF contribution top up be better because some of it goes into OA  or would taking a housing loan and topping up into SA be better?Also  if you have any other interesting approaches  do let me know as well! Thanks!,btohqsg
Personal opinion:Would not go for voluntary topupDepends if you do your own investments such as ETFs.Take a housing loan (1.5% interest expense)  have a huge CPF SA balance (4% interest income). Then use your cash/cpf oa to pay down your mortgage,btohqsg
Hi all  I'm foreigner and new to Singapore. I have watched Chris' videos on credit cards and I'd like to apply one. Do I need to wait several months to let the bank have my salary records  or am I be eligible to apply it now? Thanks!,btohqsg
(of course  I want a higher credit lineüòÜ,btohqsg
The benchmark is 3 months of payslip  but no harm trying!Bank would usually give you 4x monthly salary of credit limit,btohqsg
Oh oh  that's a bit longüò¢ Thanks for replying,btohqsg
So before that  do you have advice on Debit cards?,btohqsg
Go for Grabpay Mastercard. It's a prepaid card so you can top up in the Grab Superapp  which is really useful in Singapore,btohqsg
