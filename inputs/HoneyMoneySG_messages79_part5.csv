Yes i moved to a big house 2 storey recently  but signal not strong enough to coverage hence i bought an extra router/mesh on network point in other bedroom to extend coverage range without an extender. I am under M1.,btohqsg
Onr not router tho  its a small rectangular black box that provides he internet speed to your router/mesh,btohqsg
nope  as it needs to be programmed from what I understand. which needs to be done by the network provider. but maybe other experts can chime inSomeone tried it here -https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/threads/optical-network-terminal-ont-vs-optical-netork-router-onr-whats-the-difference.5768534/page-5#post-128749014,btohqsg

How do you know the issue lies with the Optical Fibre Box? Singtel arranged someone down to check and conclude that the fibre optic box is faulty or the cable running from external of your home to your box?,btohqsg
what do you mean signal degrade?In all honesty  rather than router/ap/mesh or even isp   how you lay out/position the access points  is typically more important.,btohqsg
ONR is a router. its in the name haha (optical network router). Unless you mean ONT (optical network terminal),btohqsg
Cause1. When using my old wifi tplink 6 mesh the speed become 100-200mbps when my plan is 2gbps  used to be 500-600mbps2. Verify if my mesh is an issue or not  so change to wifi 7 router  still same slow speed3. I check the onr admin portal  cpu usage keeps spiking up and down n constantly hot even when my onr is place at a well ventilation place4. I bought a optical network cable and change it but still same thingSingtel won’t change one for me unless it totally stop working like unable to power on  unable to send the speed to my router,btohqsg
Is not really a router  it the same as ont  both connect to the termination point and get wifi signal and speed from the tp  your phone can’t get wifi speed with just the onr itself  it won’t transmit out any signal for your phone to connect  that’s y need the router/mesh,btohqsg
this is semantics  but what you're describing is an access point ;;; but i hear you  pmed you to keep it more on topic for this group,btohqsg

This figure is the % return and it's not unusual for it to fluctuate within a reasonable range. Your capital is still intact. I would be concerned only if the unit net value is dropping.,btohqsg
