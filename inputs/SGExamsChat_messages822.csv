hi does anybody here know the benefits of taking h3 beside overseas apps,btohqsg
Anyone got past year paper for chem and math?,btohqsg
scholarships / uni wise h3 can only give u a slight adv (if it is relevant to the course) but some of those competitive courses portfolio more important and will give u a better advantage,btohqsg
some h3 cover uni y1 content so if you take certain h3 can be exempted from some mods in uni,btohqsg
It also helps to see if you are interested in pursuing certain majors in the future,btohqsg
i think it was a fight,btohqsg
ya like later you take h3 and hate it  can help rule out taking that in uni,btohqsg
guy ended up in the water  cant swim and drowned,btohqsg
nope it was on a insta post,btohqsg
I took h3 math and afterwards completely rule out taking math in uni,btohqsg
Good la completely ruling out taking math is a good choice tbh,btohqsg
And i died in the sea of proofs,btohqsg
Yea and it stopped me from maybe taking math in uni,btohqsg
Lol why you want to take H3 math in the first place?,btohqsg
Yea‚Ä¶i cant imagine doing math in uni,btohqsg
The thing is‚Ä¶I actually dk  i was offered and just wanted to give it a shot (regretted tho),btohqsg
And also the class was full of the FM kids and the top classes people soüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
it's really just an interest thing  or should be anyway,btohqsg
Who knows maybe we get to introduce you as Prof Si Yan,btohqsg
siyan will always be senpai to me :),btohqsg
so not much benefit in terms of portfolio wise or uni admissions wise?,btohqsg
so what you are saying is  is that it is better for someone doing 3h2 1h1/4h2 with 70rp and maxed out portfolio pertaining to their course compared to someone doing 3h2 1h1/4h2 with 70rp and h3 distinction but no portfolio at all (in terms of rate of acceptance into dentistry/med/cs/law/other competitive courses),btohqsg
üëçüèª but do you only get exempted from a few mods in uni,btohqsg
i mean it can‚Äôt be the latter  right?,btohqsg
Depends on the course but 1-2 if it's related to your uni major,btohqsg
I would say portfolio matters more but ofc if u hv the portfolio + h3 in sth related then that is a +,btohqsg
i am trying to portray how cancerous that sounds,btohqsg
bruh that's like my ideal subject combu,btohqsg
H2 econs isn't that ideal sis,btohqsg
Its the brain damage from the H2. Stop doing H2s,btohqsg
We r starting on vietnam war later,btohqsg
Probably gonna start with Dien Bien Phu,btohqsg
If H2 econs is in the room Blink twice,btohqsg
theres more ppl taking h2 hist with h2 econs than without,btohqsg
I mean I am not a History Major so I fail to understand how is that a bad thing,btohqsg
If y'all go hong kong in the future  you won't see this bus company anymore,btohqsg
Nah for H3 math there is no exemptions,btohqsg
I mean it makes sense since H3 math and MA1100 are both heaven and hell,btohqsg
And also courses that are fixed curriculum etc most likely cant grant module exemption,btohqsg
Random but if you enjoy matcha  this matcha warabimochi (at Takashimaya) very shiok,btohqsg
so are you surethat pfme+ h3 math is your ideal combi?,btohqsg
Are you planning to do math major in university?,btohqsg
Actually  I‚Äôve gone and left haha,btohqsg
i thought h3 can be a part of portfolio  if its directly related to ur course,btohqsg
don‚Äôt know. that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm asking,btohqsg
i‚Äôm just checking  because if it doesn‚Äôt have much benefits  then even if my promo results are stellar i‚Äôm not going to take h3s,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt even have any idea on what i want to do,btohqsg
i think i‚Äôll decide on a specific course after my exams.,btohqsg
i alr have a h3 in mind and im doing relatively well in that subj,btohqsg
im pretty set on taking that h3 as long as i hit the reqs,btohqsg
u prob gonna start with how ho chi minh rise to power,btohqsg
The power relationship between decolonisation and Americas involvement with Vietnam is intertwined,btohqsg
ya cuz the america dw the vietnam to become communist,btohqsg
thats why they colonise south vietnam,btohqsg
The earlier involvement and abstinence was due to prior French involvement,btohqsg
Also Dien Bien Phu was fought by Vietminh forces,btohqsg
So idk what are u spewing,btohqsg
America was actually an ally during WW2 for the VietMinh,btohqsg
1) look at the h3 subjects on offer and whether it is of any relevance to ur desired course. Even if u are not certain yet  at least like ‚Äòa possible course option for urself‚Äô (some schs certain h3 subjects will not hit min quota anywaysüíÄ)2) As for the advantage  it will be more advantageous if ur h3 is somewhat related to the course u are going into  even if it isnt but u still did well  maybe a slight tiny advantage for courses that requires an interview stage.3) as for portfolio wise  yes it includes h3 / academic competition also‚Ä¶but a ++ to the portfolio would be stuff like CCA stuff  leadership  community service  degree-related competition (like i seen some of my batchmates participate in university tech comps in jc alr),btohqsg
is only because of japanese opposition,btohqsg
It was the ideal of a shifting landscape which is incompatible with your bipolar view of what the cold war was.,btohqsg
but the vietminh was funded by soviet union  china and usa,btohqsg
Also I would hesitate to call South Vietnam an extension of Colonialism,btohqsg
Those are different periods with different structures of control.,btohqsg
Bare in mine the window between A level result release and the earliest university application deadline is 1 month,btohqsg
No the Vietminh was funded and started with CIA money funnily enough,btohqsg
Also your idea of parties just funding no questions asked is problematic as well.,btohqsg
It was more of Ho Chi Minh shifting and playing off sides and vice versa,btohqsg
The communists aren't just a unifed bloc of the traditional view,btohqsg
This isn't the time of Mccarthy whereby u just assume a single Communist ideal,btohqsg
Idk he is tryna say a seminal battle isn't part of the lead up to learning about Vietnam,btohqsg
Also his idea of what constitutes Colonialism is concerning to say the least.,btohqsg
Imo if you don't have the intention to do math or physics major in the future  then you should avoid H3 math,btohqsg
has anyone received their eae email yet,btohqsg
I don't think got anyone here going eae,btohqsg
Ns  poly  jc or uni alr,btohqsg
I think u can check status?,btohqsg
Actually I cannot remember haha coz I also bought a 5-piece box of it for a friendhttps://www.instagram.com/kamakura_singapore?igsh=aHRoa2M1OWx3Y2hoThe matcha flavour is only available at Taka but they have two other outlets: One Holland V and opposite Orchard Central,btohqsg
I want to buy so much matcha,btohqsg
I thought you couldn't buy humans anymore especially after what happened.,btohqsg
I shall go check it out! I love matcha,btohqsg
I hv been yawning like crazy,btohqsg
Maybe coz i woke up early tdy to go to the doctor,btohqsg
the 6 pieces chicken for $10 ?,btohqsg
Funny thing is when i lie down  suddenly not tired‚Ä¶,btohqsg
U go turn on the TV and watch CHT talking about Oil Floatation live,btohqsg
You know what else is 100% fall asleep,btohqsg
Will fall asleep in the opp direction,btohqsg
Thing is I prefer Si Yans lap,btohqsg
It's like preferring a hard bed lestin :(,btohqsg
SOOO I GOT TO MOVE ON AND BE WHOOOO I AMMMMM,btohqsg

Let's waste company time tgt Wyatt kor kor,btohqsg
to me this sounds like you are really discouraging us from doing h3 math or math major üòÇ,btohqsg
aaah okok   i actually have a relative who got into a competitive uni course without any h3s so i think it would be better for me to focus on my h2s and gp üòÖ,btohqsg
It depends on individual  like whether u like math‚Ä¶and if u re considering math major  can consider try taking h3 math and see if it is what u want to do (h3 math is somewhat uni math maj foundation,btohqsg
then what about fm? is that close to uni math or no,btohqsg
these questions are just for my understanding,btohqsg
but tldr  for me you don't take h3 unless it's smth you're interested in learning more about be it curiosity or seeing if you wanna pursue it further,btohqsg
the advantage to admissions itself is v minimal,btohqsg
Is H3 Si Yan offered because I wanna pursue that deeper,btohqsg
We will learn about siyan's semiconductor theory,btohqsg
FM is closer to the uni math in like physics and engineering. a math major is very broad in terms of specialisations so harder to say there,btohqsg
H3 is more proof oriented and isn't THAT useful for most courses,btohqsg
well theoretical but regarding semicon systems,btohqsg
So does this mean I get to pursue you further?,btohqsg
once u take fm u have signed a pact with the devil,btohqsg
I would like him to come up with a theory why im bad at physics/s,btohqsg
i would rather buy spring chicken,btohqsg
Na it's just quantum possibility u are both good and bad at the same time,btohqsg
Isn't that a good thing? The smell of Desperation,btohqsg
Also obligatory this link works until teaching week 2https://sso.wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe88/owa/sso_login1.asp?t=1&p2=https://wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe/owa/change_course.pre_main&extra=&pg=,btohqsg
Physics exists as packets of energy which are in continuous random motion. By newton's 3rd law  there is an equal and opposing force acting on the light waves  hence net force = 0  thats why not just only you  but all of us are bad at physics,btohqsg
Schrodinger's problem we are all bad at physics the moment of observation,btohqsg

What does kranji and kunji mean??? Idk,btohqsg
How can i ask your appa??? üëÅ,btohqsg
U r not talking to my oppa,btohqsg
Steven lim kor kor is mine,btohqsg
Lestin :( Si Yan rejected me üò≠,btohqsg
im grading your shit next sem,btohqsg
He legit gonna talk about how bad my exam skills gonna be,btohqsg
I walk into any tests/exams with a blank mind,btohqsg
I don't even know what it entails,btohqsg
U aren't supposed to do that?,btohqsg
There can be 5 questions in a finals,btohqsg
I tot u had to be calm in exams?,btohqsg
And i wouldnt have a final answer for all 5,btohqsg
Actly can u mutliply vectors in e math,btohqsg
Hey a pass is a pass..,btohqsg
For some reason there can still be people doing worse than me,btohqsg
Even ntu h3 semicon if i wanna do electronics?,btohqsg
then what are you doing with that combi fam,btohqsg
Wdf how tf am I a nerd,btohqsg
useful for knowledge doesn't translate to useful in admissions compared to just having a high RP,btohqsg
I am far too retarded for that,btohqsg
also ntu h3 semicon is more on the actual physical mechanisms of semiconductors which engineering doesn't actually go that deep into,btohqsg
it's really a condensed matter physics thing,btohqsg
Why have a High RPwhen u can just have Si Yan,btohqsg
I cant rmb the engineering course i wanna take but i think theres one thats more specified in semicon oso,btohqsg
yeah i heard it‚Äôs better for someone with a ‚Üë rp but with 0 h3 than someone with a ‚Üì rp but with a h3 distinction,btohqsg
applications on the usage and functions of semicon is different from the underlying physics of it,btohqsg
RP is temporary Si Yan is eternal,btohqsg
Shit rp doesnt translate to bad uni experience,btohqsg
Then look at me (im still having a bad uni experience),btohqsg
If i had a good rp i wouldnt be in physics,btohqsg
none of my group of friends had >80 RP but end up all at least second upper,btohqsg
I mean maybe u changed courses,btohqsg
Who knows maybe u did it for Si Yan,btohqsg
one of them <70 RP then NTU first class  halfway through undergrad got MOE scholar now doing PGDE,btohqsg
Meanwhile me:When I graduate  unemployment awaits,btohqsg
After going through uni for 2 years,btohqsg
Its genuinely not that hard to do well,btohqsg
Just need to be consistent af,btohqsg
But being consistent is probably tougher than the content lmao,btohqsg
i think that applies for our course but for others idk,btohqsg
The most anal thing is admin,btohqsg
i heard from my ft that jc is the tough part,btohqsg
Okay i guess i can only say for physics,btohqsg
phys comp math econs is mine üòê,btohqsg
I guess the tough thing about jc is that you have to cram all the content in 2 years,btohqsg
ok the idea that jc is tougher than uni is honestly bullshit,btohqsg
I mean for Uni u can elect to do so too,btohqsg
that‚Äôs what my ft said to us üò≠,btohqsg
your mindset when approaching A levels vs uni is different,btohqsg
i mean i found jc more enjoyable sooo,btohqsg
this is exactly what she was implying üò≠ oh gosh,btohqsg
The mental shock when you realise your finals are in 4 months,btohqsg
Na it's when it's in 4 weeks,btohqsg
Depends on the amount of fucks given,btohqsg
biggest difference between jc to uni for me is being able to adapt and be resourceful for independent learning,btohqsg
but id wager that 88.75(pw B) + h3 in related course > 90 w/o h3,btohqsg
I only study after week 13,btohqsg
Hey it can be 4 hours or 4 mins for the real pros,btohqsg
Wait this is the hardest part for me sia,btohqsg
then again if ur Pw is the B it means that your grades are alr v good,btohqsg
Because i relied on tuition for most part of jc,btohqsg
and maybe is siaolang drag u down,btohqsg
so idt pw B that life ruining,btohqsg
profs in uni  outside of a few  won't spoon feed you exactly what to say  how to tackle things,btohqsg
you gotta figure it out yourself or at least take initiative to consult them  but even then it's largely on you,btohqsg
Imo it's navigating thru the minefield of admin hell,btohqsg
Most give vague tentative feedback even with consults,btohqsg
some profs will genuinely suck at teaching LOL,btohqsg
And some legit suck at admin,btohqsg
I find the admin one worse,btohqsg
Because nothing spells hell when your prof is supposed to upload course materials 2 weeks overdue,btohqsg
i'll try my best to not suck as a TA lmao,btohqsg
TA imo dun rlly have much power cuz the main discretion is with the prof :/,btohqsg
y‚Äôall making uni sound like hell when i‚Äôve seen a lot of hellish stories about poly kids struggling with üí© teammates,btohqsg
Tru but in my experience usually when the prof is sht u just have to sit down and take it,btohqsg
you get people that don't do shit but also got people that friendly fire you,btohqsg
TA at least I can complain to prof maybe get some concessions,btohqsg
ya but that's the thing between a science major and yours,btohqsg
hopefully I can go to nus or ntu,btohqsg
Pulau ntu is a vibe tho fr,btohqsg
comms is the cannot wear flip flops and shorts faculty,btohqsg
It feels like a place on its own,btohqsg
i like it better than nus and i've spent enough time in both,btohqsg
Everything that happens in NTU STAYS in NTU,btohqsg
Oh one thing going for ntu fr,btohqsg
Wish they had guaranteed fixed hall fees,btohqsg
i just don't like that nus is scattered along the area instead of feeling like a cohesive campus,btohqsg
Whenever I go into NTU I am reminded of the show the Sound of Music,btohqsg
The Hills are alive with the sound of musiccccc,btohqsg
Sharing  especially with those who are into music. Livestreaming tomorrow at 7.30 pmhttps://www.extraordinarypeople.sg,btohqsg
Oh no la. This is a special needs organisation,btohqsg
ok tbh i chose fm bc1. i have interest2. idw chem,btohqsg
i think if u choose fm solely to escape chem u got what's coming to u,btohqsg
if u take fm u will be learning like 3 topics at once,btohqsg
Damn is h2 chem really that traumatic,btohqsg
I felt like physics was worse lmao,btohqsg
I can take 3 at once.,btohqsg
in that case then yeah fm shld be fine,btohqsg
no my chem is just ass,btohqsg
I do like math more than chem for sure,btohqsg
how much do u like maths tho,btohqsg
tbh idm chem but i dont love it,btohqsg
then again the course iw in uni need chem anyways,btohqsg
Ok i dont love chem per se,btohqsg
Its just the less evil of physics and math for me,btohqsg
bio- actl a little bit interestedchem- okay okaymath- quite interestinghist- yaygp- okay okay also i like essay and aq but abhor saqpw-yuck,btohqsg
Phy - noChem - okokMath - i didnt take A math what is thisEcons - wtf is this brain rot my hands are tiredGp - why am i always getting UPw - cry,btohqsg
Because of econs i tried learning to write with my left hand to substitute my right hand when its tired,btohqsg
Phy - honestly idk what's rlly happeningmath/fmath - no commentecons - tbh surprisingly well (prob bc H1)gp - üíÄpw - üíÄ,btohqsg
H1 econs actually didnt click until the last month before As lol,btohqsg
After that it was easy breezy,btohqsg
i like that we dont rlly have to do essays anymore,btohqsg
combined hist in sec sch was one of the experiences of all time,btohqsg
my chem was better than physics before jc,btohqsg
I mean more of like H3 math emphasizes more of mathematical proofs,btohqsg
i think for me it's just the way i learned chem didn't translate well,btohqsg
Okay o level chem is honestly,btohqsg
You don't have to understand anything,btohqsg
i didn't take o levels but probs similar enough,btohqsg
If you take an engineering degree  more often than not H2 FM gives you a lot of headstart,btohqsg
having a base level understanding of multivariable calculus and linear algebra is great,btohqsg
they removed a bunch of stuff for the new syllabus tho,btohqsg
my tutor said it's strange they removed arc length for para curves but left in arc length for polar,btohqsg
But engineering degree don't really deal with a lot of mathematical proofs (they do discuss but not as extensive as compared to a math major content)  so you are better off spending your time preparing for your essential subjects if you are not planning to be a math major,btohqsg
the changes actually include stuff that is more applicable to engineering/applied math side,btohqsg
bc i rmb they took out conics,btohqsg
"my teacher speculate the syllabus changes is bc ppl prev said the fm syllabus was ""too broad""",btohqsg
but they include basic multivariable calculus which is not too different from single variable tbh but useful nonetheless,btohqsg
Plus H3 math you will be dealing more with combinatorics  proof techniques  number theory,btohqsg
personally the conic stuff has never been used in uni  but experience may differ,btohqsg
You don't need number theory for an engineering degree,btohqsg
While FM usually has LA  calculus  DE  multivariable calculus that will be able to give you a headstart for engineering math modules,btohqsg
it's really just applying the same calculus concepts to equations with 2 variables  but the steps don't change too much,btohqsg
"they excluded all the stuff that's more ""new""",btohqsg
Say hello to transition metals and organic chem,btohqsg
idk if i rmb clearly but i rmb one of my other teachers say she's confident she can finish multivariable calc in less than 12 hrs,btohqsg
So if you have zero interest in doing math/physics/CS (to a very little extent) in the future  then don't waste your time doing H3 math. You are better off preparing your main essential subjects,btohqsg
yes. if you alr know calculus it's actually damn fast to translate,btohqsg
But then again I'm more of org chem then inorg,btohqsg
wait i replied to the wrong message,btohqsg
Transition metal - not much of content to even formulate a complaint aboutOrganic chem - i love this  i dont have to think mathematically at all,btohqsg
For me I hate periodic the most,btohqsg
but now it's gone in its entirety,btohqsg
If you have some interest in doing math/physics/CS (to a minimal extent)  then why not give H3 math a try,btohqsg
Yeah its memory but it kinda relates to chem bonding  no?,btohqsg
There are so little time to do that many stuff. So why not allocate your time properly,btohqsg
my fm teacher say now that arc length formula is in mf27 he not sure how cambridge will set the qns from now on,btohqsg
It's those reaction of oxides n chlorides w water shit,btohqsg
prev he say like arc length is easy 4m,btohqsg
Shit i forgot so much about A levels alr,btohqsg
THOSE ARE SO STUPID I DONT LIKE,btohqsg
imagine they do a 2021 on hs,btohqsg
Sorry korkor old already A level was 5 years ago,btohqsg
Cuz my geog sylla first batch,btohqsg
Literally all the fucking fieldwork from past prelim papers or what,btohqsg
seeing the MF number makes me feel damn old,btohqsg
seeing MF26 used to scare me when i was sec 3,btohqsg
before that it was MF17 i think,btohqsg
But ok la it's not like completely diff,btohqsg
Main diff is the qn structure,btohqsg
Eh what's Ur A level again,btohqsg
Covid warped my sense of time,btohqsg
Everything is relative to 2019 bruh,btohqsg
think I tried Ur paper B4 alrd,btohqsg
i didn't even try my own paper,btohqsg
my math A level was an E so,btohqsg
didn't study until the night before,btohqsg
i feel like i've told this story a lot of times,btohqsg
I know friends who study weeks before but still fail,btohqsg
none of my A levels was studied more than a day before,btohqsg
I go to popular sometimes like to burn some time and flip thru the TYS be like,btohqsg
Dude study night before and gets E,btohqsg
bc the normal curve thing so much shit s,btohqsg
Is that why i dont have an E in my cert,btohqsg
Go hard or go home U or A,btohqsg
ok at most 2 days but like i def didn't feel the sense of urgency until we stopped having to go to sch,btohqsg
I love telling people i got 2As in my cert,btohqsg
so idk a few weeks before a levels to cram everything üíÄ,btohqsg
And they think i scored super well for my rp,btohqsg
U mean the word Advanced on top isit,btohqsg
on the other hand  bedok not happy with 2 As,btohqsg
Cuz that's the only A on my cert,btohqsg
i still have my physics TYS and can confirm it's still empty üíÄ,btohqsg
Actually that's how I found out SUSS legit is sus,btohqsg
They count PW as a mandatory subject even as a private candidate,btohqsg
So I auto kena docked -10RP,btohqsg
Hi anyone DSA to NYJC b4? Any tips to DSA well in leadership cus I can't do anyt academically genius like my friends,btohqsg
There's like 20 other dumb administrative headaches. Like requiring a School Graduation Certificate in the submission portal,btohqsg
My fren ask if can dsa with psl in leadership before,btohqsg
i dont think its enough eh,btohqsg
i psl for 3 years i never get to support my classmates at all,btohqsg
That does it show on the LEAPs lmao,btohqsg
In general if u dun hit 4 at attainment for Leadership don't talk about DSA Leadership lmao,btohqsg
it seems to be the opposite,btohqsg
Level 3 is legit not enough,btohqsg
lvl 3 they might 50 50,btohqsg
Level 3 won't be enuf to dsa I assume,btohqsg
if u acad strong then okay,btohqsg
Also assuming your LEAPS still -2,btohqsg
Y wld u rely on lvl 3 leadership dsa,btohqsg
like how bedok retakes A lvls,btohqsg
U won't that's why it wouldn't make sense to DSA LEADERSHIP,btohqsg
Ye lvl 3 of anything hard to dsa  dsa quite small intake so ofc need high quality,btohqsg
Imma dsa leadership with my eco ambassador,btohqsg
Bedok would be very angry if he was here,btohqsg
nah he wld say penta U,btohqsg
Cue some bs about how he will get better,btohqsg
Is like the drug addict saying they are clean,btohqsg
he is better in the administrative assistant work,btohqsg
Btw u can just thumbs up in that text itself,btohqsg
wah but his office dont require him to reservist,btohqsg
my chem was a complete shitshow,btohqsg
so he can Â∫ä all day,btohqsg
Probably do just not HIM specifically,btohqsg
Now u are doctor of physics,btohqsg
siyan got inspired by tan jiaqi,btohqsg
fm didn't exist in my batch lol,btohqsg
üíÄ would u have taken it though,btohqsg
fcp encourages ppl to take fm,btohqsg
idk bc i thought i'd like chem back then,btohqsg
i only took chem cause bio,btohqsg
my chem was consistently shitty throughout y4,btohqsg
also back then i can't take physics without taking chem so,btohqsg
nvm but the person gone alr,btohqsg
And Joe was someone we tot eh Vice President only then will retire,btohqsg
