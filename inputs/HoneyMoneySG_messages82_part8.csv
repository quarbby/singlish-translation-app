Hmm is UOB Cash Plus under current/savings? Technically it is a PLOC account but not sure if it is counted as a special type of current/savings account?,btohqsg
Personal line of credit? Well it is categorized under loan....http://www.uob.com.sg/personal/borrow/personal-financing/cashplus.page,btohqsg
Yeah you answered it yourself ma.. it's a loan.. lol,btohqsg
guys..UOB one account is supposed to be a current or savings account ar?TYIA....,btohqsg
Haha just wasn't too sure how these products are categorized in the context of the earmark promo.....Anw the first three months is interest and processing fee free  if anyone is interested....,btohqsg
Which credit card is best for shoppee and tiktok spending?,btohqsg
Honestly doesn't make much of difference... But if you want to split based on UOB's description you can go onto their website. By their definition  Everyday Use accounts are Current accounts while Consistent Saving accounts are Savings accounthttps://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/index.page,btohqsg
Hi! Have a question.If my citi rewards card billing cycle restarts on 4th every month and I pay my singtel bill with it tomorrow on the 3rd and let's say it gets posted the subsequent day on the 4th  it'll only appear on the refreshed bill starting from 4th right? It'll follow the post date and not the transaction date correct?,btohqsg
What the heck is tiktok spending ðŸ™ƒ is it the shop tab?,btohqsg
Tiktok shop perhaps  live selling etc,btohqsg
thanks melvyn..nvm..so long it's the HISA one can oleady..hahaor HICA i mean!,btohqsg
Apparently it shows up onheymax.ai. You can use it to find out what's the best card for you.,btohqsg
Hi Melvyn  you are saying that top up in Jan is much better compared to year end Dec top up. Be it for Self Top Up to Own SA or Top Up to loved ones?,btohqsg
Basically like every other savings accounts.. earlier you put  earlier the account clock interest... The difference is that interest on contributions will be clocked on the following month so it matters less which day you put in but more on which month you put in.,btohqsg
Hi  I have a question.If I have a UOB one joint account and my partner is the supplementary account user and applies for a UOB EVOL card  is it eligible for the $500 monthly spend for the interest rate?,btohqsg
Hello gurus. Can I ask if anyone understands the tnc for existing user for OCBC salary crediting promo?ðŸ˜³ I have read the tnc for many times but I donâ€™t see any construction for existing customers to participate this promo for 78 dollars. Is there any sign up form like uob promo or we just credit salary into 360 account and wait for the gift?ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
YouTrip annual wallet limits now increased to $20k max balance and $100k max spending,btohqsg

Any idea if the NS credits > you trip > big pay > grab > paynow method still works today?,btohqsg
Does the uniplus account matter if only using the new uob stash account for the promo?Like new stash account which is the reference account  balance is considered 0. Just top up 100k  balance in uniplus doesn't matter?,btohqsg
Wow. So u donâ€™t want the rewards anymore since u withdraw?,btohqsg
I want  just being confused with the tnc as it stated can withdraw from 2jan onwards,btohqsg
Tot it will be lesser than 4k if withdraw during free look,btohqsg

Would like to join this group,btohqsg
Is there any summary/ariticle i can refer to regarding the CPf strategies employed?,btohqsg
eventually you will hit the bhs. i have not done topups and am only scheduled to hit bhs when im 37. after that then the supercharge of sa will take place. even at this slower pace  still should be able to hit 1m by 55,btohqsg
but just want to get a general feel. for others that hasnt done any vcma  what age did you guys hit bhs?,btohqsg
Can consider thishttps://www.heartlandboy.com/Of course Chris yt should be the main source.,btohqsg
How will you hit BHS by 37 without top ups?,btohqsg
through employment income lo. 102k x 8% is 8160 yearly not including interest  bhs only increases ~3k yearly. slowly close the gap,btohqsg
Yea but isnâ€™t the contribution limit 37740? So 8% = 3019? Or am I wrong? Sorry just trying to learn here,btohqsg
nono 37740 is 37% of 102k. below 35  the 37% is further broken down into 23% oa  6% sa  8% ma. so you take 8% of 102k and not 37740,btohqsg
Iâ€™m scheduled to hit at around 35 at my current rate. Didnâ€™t do any voluntary top up but was fortunate to hit the cpf limit early on in my career,btohqsg
thats why quite important to get a good starting pay. i only managed to hit the limit at 32/33,btohqsg
Ok ok. So if I have 40k left to reach BHS  itâ€™d take me roughly 5 years more (assuming I hit cpf limit alr and BHS amt doesnâ€™t change) Thanks!,btohqsg
Can anyone educate me on the FD Rates  why i lock 6mth get more interest than locking up 12mth?,btohqsg
u talking about the p.a. interest rate? Cos guaranteeing interest rate over a longer period incur more risk. Should interest rates drop in future the bank cannot adjust the interest lower.,btohqsg
It doesn't matter if it doesn't exist,btohqsg
@terminatorxanwelcome  you must be new here. See above quoted message for more info on CPF and retirement planning.,btohqsg
"With around 5k MA yearly contributions and only 3 years of VCMA  hit before 30. The ""general feel"" not very accurate one.",btohqsg
