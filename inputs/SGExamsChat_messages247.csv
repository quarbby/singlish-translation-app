The last time I took the paper was in 2018 but I believe that I still have the skills and knowledge to mentor with the SBQ n essay skills accquired from H2 History,btohqsg
I always share my opinions on discord,btohqsg
SBQ is quite fun tbh it is just it can be quite hard to score at 1st,btohqsg
Ah neans i seen u somewherw alr,btohqsg
I oni use it for interest groups,btohqsg
Hahaha yes . But I dun really rmb seeing much of a ans key in sec school . More of practices and consultations for me,btohqsg
But i dont think u will recognise mme,btohqsg
I use it for kopitiam only,btohqsg
Yes. Same here. Will probably have to refresh my memory for that,btohqsg
Shouldve asked u last time uwu,btohqsg
Im a f9 student for ss,btohqsg
No harm anyways  shouldnt take too much of ur time,btohqsg
Yes for some I used to hate SBQs since it is quite intimidating at 1st but soon I fell in love with it as I enjoyed the process of mastering it and transferring what I learnt in pure History to that:),btohqsg
My cohort had banding where the f9 class literally just focus on purpose paragraphs for all qn types,btohqsg
My history teacher was a SS teacher too,btohqsg
He wants to interview u as his bf,btohqsg
So confused whos the he and bf here HAHA,btohqsg
Hahaha context - audience and purpose too,btohqsg
Its hard for me but i got a2 after spamming purpose paras so,btohqsg
Purpose to convince everyone it is hard just cuz she thinks it is hard,btohqsg
From my knowledge   nameless cat is known for saying assetion is not hard,btohqsg
Intended outcome to make me look like I'm some smartie in ss,btohqsg
F9 to A2 in 1 month owo,btohqsg
Nameless catâ€™s sentence is to convince everyone else that assstion is easy,btohqsg
I spam papers and do all qns not really  selective about qns types.,btohqsg
I worked on ss in total   3 months ? C6- A1,btohqsg
My teacher : no we are not doing Tys now (after me spamming him with 5yeRs of Tys),btohqsg
Because my first ct was March this year,btohqsg
I started working on ss at jab,btohqsg
My student didn't even have exam,btohqsg
My cher nvr even use ss tys  just use other sch paper,btohqsg
He started 2 weeks b4 n levels,btohqsg
I forgotten my grades for internal already but I got A1 in the end.,btohqsg
I don't even teach any tys one,btohqsg
Done like 8-9 school papers ?,btohqsg
he ask me go redo sec 3 ones,btohqsg
u can ask mi I got 30 stacks for ss,btohqsg
Maybe because you have to get your foundations right 1st,btohqsg
Hey im a lazy but diligent student,btohqsg
cause all the others is the same   my main problem is assetion,btohqsg
Im not exactly the studious type,btohqsg
So he ask me work on it,btohqsg
as long as itâ€™s my ss Cher who teach it,btohqsg
OK BUT UK WAT I MEAN,btohqsg
But that means Ur assertion will have higher mark,btohqsg
Which is so much btr for mi to bs,btohqsg
Till now idk how do assertion HAHA,btohqsg
Just keep spamming links between sources ok alt,btohqsg
For me   itâ€™s Lways the p+p para that pulls me up,btohqsg
What a moodðŸ˜‚. I dun have a very clear definition for that but knows how to do it,btohqsg
Oh ic. But at least that is helping you :),btohqsg
HAHA idk nvr see it before,btohqsg
I have thrown away my worksheets and practices from secondary school alreadyðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Yeah true. In JC I at most hit a L4 for SBQ . Essay L5 is quite feasible for me.Miss the breaking down of SBQs into different parts,btohqsg
I wish there is H2 ss,btohqsg
In jC history  it is only part A and B,btohqsg
If only I'm home I send y'all smth,btohqsg
Yeah. Part A for compare and contrast 2 sources. Part B for assessing reliability + usefulness of 6 sources while treating it as a set,btohqsg
Technically it's just CLEEP Ã— 2,btohqsg
Yeah. So it is infusion of SS into it too :),btohqsg
IM STILL GONNA TAKE H2 GEOG,btohqsg
It's cuz I don't learn from scho,btohqsg
Before I get killed by Bedok,btohqsg
Its sleep but c not s,btohqsg
How bout h2 Geog   lit   history,btohqsg
First sentence (agree or disagree )EvidenceOutcomeOutcome of outcome,btohqsg
Content heavy so be mentally prep for it:),btohqsg

Yeah.  But i agree .My class barely covered on that tbh,btohqsg
Its not in syllabus  oni be used as contextual examples,btohqsg
Yeah. The 1st overarching assumption in Econs that I learnt about:),btohqsg
Some never sign â€”> havent develop yet,btohqsg
Countries who industrialised earlier â€”-> USA,btohqsg

Oni those who achieved targets can help other countries set up the clean energy tjingy,btohqsg
Then one example is like norway or smth,btohqsg
Pure geog and h1 geog very very similar,btohqsg
Just slightly more indepth and exam structure abit different,btohqsg
