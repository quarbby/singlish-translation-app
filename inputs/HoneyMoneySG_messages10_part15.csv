Grab Topup Not same as Grab Spend.Grab spend is when you link up your credit card to Grab app and spend from there. (No grab points earn)Only Amex related cards earn rewards for Grab Topups currently.,btohqsg
The video din say grab spend. Mentioned grab top up. Otherwise it won’t be grouped with EZ-Link and NFP,btohqsg
