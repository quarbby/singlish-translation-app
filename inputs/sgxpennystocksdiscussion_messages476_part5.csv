Your Morning Quick Read ‚Äì 20 July 2021A nervous and healthy pullbackIt‚Äôs a pullback Monday. Investors appear to be in a defensive mood. So we saw stock prices coming down while bond prices move up.The fear of the Covid-19 Delta variant is real. It was the trigger for the significant sell-off and an opportunity for the markets to let off some steam after breaking to new highs without a correction. The sell-off appears to be appreciated by investors willing to look past the current Delta variant concern and buy up some discount names.Cyclical stocks getting a hitWe observe a more significant hit on the cyclical and economically sensitive companies who bear the brunt of the declines. This is more pronounced in Pika World‚Äôs favourite Russell 2000  which hit our portfolio once more.The Dow  essentially a value play component  fell 2.1%  its worst day since October 2020. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to below 1.2%  its lowest level since February  as US oil prices tumbled too.An explosive variant outbreak again?The Delta variant is a more contagious version of the Covid virus. It has become a dominat strain in the US as it accounts for most of the affected cases. However  data appears to show that the spread is less severe in high vaccination rates. While the new daily cases were up by 70% in a week  the hospitalisation and death rates were not climbing as fast.This might be the straw of relief for the market  temporarily at least.The implication on the economy-Stagflation?There are a couple of ways we can look at the situation. First  the new wave of Covid-19 infection raises the speculation of a new wave of lockdowns and restrictions that could hamper the economic recovery. Second  given that inflation pressures are in place and that the commodity prices are on the rise (although some are moderating) as supply chains struggle to keep pace with demand  ‚Äústagflation‚Äù seems to be an ugly word for a swift inflationary environment and a senile economic growth.What‚Äôs on the menu today?At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Building Permit data for June. The expectation is for 1.7m which is a rise from 1.683m from the prior period. It is critical data as it reflects the health of the housing market. Any reduction may further cement a slowing economy  not a recession but a less robust version.A lot of good news has been baked into the economy and stock market. The pullback  while anticipated  is emotionally challenging.Will the retracement continues? We will find out tonight!Cheers  Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will be help us reach out to a wider audience.,btohqsg
