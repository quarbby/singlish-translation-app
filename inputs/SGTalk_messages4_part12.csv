I think maybe we should encourage man to have two wives.... then Can enjoy ma,btohqsg
If you're unhappy about POFMA  lack of FOIA and free media  gerrymandering and parachuted ministers  no apologies or engagement with civil societies  voting against the PAP is a way to show your displeasure if you're in a PAP stronghold. Why should they be entitled to a 60% vote share while comfortably enjoying a supermajority?I think I've made my point for the others to consider. Good night.,btohqsg
U seems to hate PAP? This is the worse reason to voteIt is likeI want my wife to love me deep deep and so I must have a mistress to check on her so that she will do my bidding,btohqsg
To be fairIf opposition corrupted  sack! Teach them to be goodIf PAP corrupted  also sack!Teach them to be goodMust be fair and shouldn’t bully WP or PAP.Singaporeans should be the People they serve and not we serve them to give them free cheque and free food!I still pissed with my TC $$$!!!!,btohqsg
eh  you sure bo? Former Ang Mo Kio Town Council general manager Wong Chee Meng got corruption case  but you want to vote out the entire AMK GRC including PM Lee? You anti-pap until like this ah?,btohqsg
If PM Lee did what Sylvia did  yes he must be out,btohqsg
Sylvia allowed blank cheques to her friends! Remember this,btohqsg
Remember it is WP own Town Council appointed members who sued WP,btohqsg
