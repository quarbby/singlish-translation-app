In scandinavian countries  they shed fur according to the seasons. Scandinavian countries do experience summer similar to us hence they will just be in their summer coat whole year round.Statiscally speaking  there is a higher chance of golden retriever getting heat stroke compared to huskies as the thick inner coat of the husky acts as an insulator from warmth and heat.,btohqsg
The space star looks so much better than the attrage,btohqsg
