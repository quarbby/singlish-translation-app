Itâ€™s going to be hard to hold big concert so I donâ€™t foresee short-mid term recovery for unusual,btohqsg
I'm just banking on the presumption that they'll be able to hold more events in China Taiwan etc,btohqsg
Ya that's why idk if they will be able to host concerts etc or not. Defo not in SG...,btohqsg
Taiwan they have been holding concerts since 2020,btohqsg
Edit  not fact. Cos no proof haha. Changed to presumption.,btohqsg
But what I understand is that the profit margin is also slim because they're not there physically  so they provide less services too,btohqsg
I was hoping they'd explore online concerts more also but idk what happened to that trend,btohqsg
even kingsmen announce profit warning though. the telescope gonna see very far to see hope,btohqsg
