Within 2.5 years period  DynaMac rose from a mere $0.08 range to hit $0.625 before retracing to $0.495 where this tender offer buy out of $0.60 was announced. Approx 600% gain.This shows that the FPSO  FSP   FLNG etc have been doing well. Also  the outlook for this industry does looks well as we can tell with the rise in stock prices for other counters that have direct/indirectlinks to this industry (Marine/OSV/Shipping) judging from BengKuang / NamCheong  Mermaid price increase too.Still  there are several other counters which might benefit but have not yet taken off.Have been collecting Kim Heng  positioned in Mencast in hopes that it will play catch up to the others. Kim Heng better  considering that it signed an MOU with Dyna Mac in 2023 for FPSO related works. Added KH $0.087 yesterday.Today DynaMac naturally have to gap up from $0.495 to $0.60 range due to the offer which could a likely boost  to counters in similar/related Industry IMO.Watch this sector closely.DYODD / OSOD,btohqsg
Past 2023 news for easy reference with regards to Kim Heng ongoing FPSO Collaboration with Dyna Mac.Extract:Under the terms of the preferred partnership arrangement  mainboard-listed Dyna-Mac can secure the use of Kim Heng’s yard facilities at agreed tariff rates for the entire term of the MOU. The MOU  signed this week  runs for two years and will automatically be renewed at the end of each term.No numbers were released  but The Straits Times understands that the deal flows could amount to over $20 million a year.Kim Heng executive chairman and chief executive Thomas Tan said the deal paves the way for his company to engage in more substantial  intricate and high-value projects  marking a significant step forward in Kim Heng’s pursuit of sustainable long-term revenue growth in the industry.Hence  KH is one to watch for the mid to longer term.

Atlantic Nav decent news recently where they mentioned a possible $0.30 special dividends after disposal and shareholder approval but yet price was pressed down upon the gap up(Not sure of the full details but do correct it if wrong)This one could recover too. ASL marine another one that been flushed quite a bit already.Looking at a sector play today  that likely will be led by this DynaMac offer news.OSOD/DYODD,btohqsg
