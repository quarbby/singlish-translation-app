HSBC EGA... just do a keyword search and u will find out it is one of the most discussed and popular high yield savings accounts,btohqsg
Yeap  I’ve looked into EGA  but I see it’s only for 4 months. So was wondering if there’s any other alternatives,btohqsg
Oic. Then I better terminate UOB one card n sync Evol with UOB one account by calling CSO  but after waiting for very long  still not my turn for CSO to serve me.,btohqsg
it is for 4 months each lockin... their promo has been running for years already,btohqsg
actually UOB One card and UOB One account share the same name but are totally unrelated one... hahayou don't need to terminate ONE card la.,btohqsg
Yea  UOB CSO normally need to wait 20mins before can get in  but if u call at around 10am to 1030am it’s quite fast,btohqsg
yesterday took me over 30 minutes just to confirm UOB Lady categories had been recognised by system...,btohqsg
Ahh I see ok! Thanks for the info,btohqsg
Because need to change UOB one card n Evol to have same cycle as UOB one account.,btohqsg
can change both to same statement date,btohqsg
DBS yuu Visa Card or American express card better? American has higher Cashback compared to Visa,btohqsg
