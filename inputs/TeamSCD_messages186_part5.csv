I would have liked gear 1 to be left then down,btohqsg
Because to go from 3 to 2 difficult,btohqsg
Which is why ferrari made it that way,btohqsg
But we will never go from 2 to 1,btohqsg
Cos race cars will nv use gear 1 except launch,btohqsg
So would have loved to have that,btohqsg
Then u can move off with 2,btohqsg
It can move off in gear 2... But the power band you will go between 2 and 3,btohqsg
These 2  3 and 4 are the nice ones,btohqsg
