Oh ok thanks everyone for the advice!! Yeah even pre-cny period i saw the list price was already close to 250k haha,btohqsg
Price go up quite a lot from when first launch haha üòÖ,btohqsg

But you can get a second hand GLB35 around this price range now,btohqsg
Haha no i was at c&c before cny list price ady close to 250k  and that is just base glb180 model,btohqsg
Dun look like have much addon options too üòÖ,btohqsg
Oh because i got mine for around 22X lol,btohqsg
thats why when you said you say its 250 im like ??,btohqsg
Wah ok means list price can nego down to there i guess haha,btohqsg
Yours is the mild hybrid model?,btohqsg
Was it during the motorshow period,btohqsg
Yeah i didnt bother to nego then cuz wasnt planning to change at that point of time,btohqsg
Oh yeah motorshow period was aro that price then went up  when i went to cnc was around maybe first week feb?,btohqsg
Ah yes i rmb it jumped up to 239k then now 245k,btohqsg
But c&c glb no rear aircon vent,btohqsg
My SA say can install locally from them after car arrive,btohqsg
Pay so much for a car,btohqsg
other countries glb180 maybe got all the goodies but c&c cant even add on anything,btohqsg
Like that just order the most basic model. After arrive install full spec,btohqsg
he can do everyth for the lowest price best quality,btohqsg
no leh  just promoting your services,btohqsg
Lax bro no say is u‚Ä¶,btohqsg
very common in SG. same problem with toyota  hyundai. alot of removed features to cut cost dk for what when the price so ex. mercedes abit surprising tho,btohqsg
Keep the OMV and ARF low  to increase their premium hahaha,btohqsg
would rather have a car with full features than this dh that dh,btohqsg
Nothing surprising. Unless you buy an S-Class  likely wont get full spec,btohqsg
Thats why i feel its better to buy a full spec Toyota Century than a E300 haha,btohqsg
Full spec camry no power window,btohqsg
the press one time wind all the way,btohqsg
But it is an indentable option?,btohqsg
Even in e worst spec  drive side window shld b minimally full auto,btohqsg
Bro u always into weird car 1,btohqsg
I was just looking at a beautiful pre-war 1930s MG TA today morning,btohqsg
When u can buy a Crown,btohqsg
I think they trying to keep the cat A glb180 super basic  last time when you buy were there a lot of addon/custom options? Cuz they are bringing in cat b glb200 according to what sa told me also that will hv more options,btohqsg
Dunno why they want to do that though feels super meaningless,btohqsg
no options to add at all.,btohqsg
Even seat colour also nothing rite lol,btohqsg
wow then i should have waited sia,btohqsg
But the glb200 is cat b  so for glb180 now close to 250k  glb200 prob close to 300k if not more?,btohqsg
At that price point totally make no sense ady might as well buy skoda kodiaq haha,btohqsg
Just tune back to 160hp can be glb200 Lor,btohqsg
but isit legal for me to tune it more than 130hp if  my car is cat a,btohqsg
No one cares abt ur tuning,btohqsg
Ur warranty u void when u tune lo,btohqsg
But usually when u tune stage 2 or 3 means got illegal mods liao,btohqsg
