Hi guys. I'm quite confused regarding the credit card minimum spend requirements. I've read different things on the subject so it's not very clear. Does the minimum spend required to be within specific categories or is it including all the expenses that are done with the credit cards? I read the citi bank cashback card document and I didn't really find it clear  not sure if the 800$ minimum spend have to fall under food  groceries and petrol categories. Any citi bank cashback card holder here who can help?Thank you!,btohqsg
It's quite clear that all transactions that are not exclusions will qualify for $800 spend requirementhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/25093,btohqsg

Interesting poll result..if it's really based on interest rate  those who choose dbs over uob must hv spend over 30k per month. Or do I calculate it wrong?,btohqsg
most should be the 15-30k range... which is 2.5% p.a.,btohqsg
UOB One is tiered..... anything below 60k not even 1%,btohqsg
"oh .. the new table not updated at their website yet... this works out to be 2+% on 100k... depends on your ""eligible spend""...",btohqsg
