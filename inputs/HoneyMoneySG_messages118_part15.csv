I‚Äôm think UOB really don‚Äôt want EXISTING customers to participate anymore.They want NEW customers la. ü§£,btohqsg
can consider usingheymax.aito check on this,btohqsg
I think in a stupid brain thinking.UOB means you have $100k  you withdraw $50k and then put back $50k. It is still $100k instead of $150k.Means you take out and in  will not keep on increasing the fresh fund counter.,btohqsg
hi guys  UOB Paynow Salary from others' own bank account still workable nowadays?,btohqsg
Ya. I think UOB don‚Äôt want people who register for 1st period of promo to take out in 1 August  then 1-2 days before the actual earmark date  put back in again.As customer has satisfied the 31 July funds in account  and have funds for earmark before the actual date  which is 30 August. (They put on 29th August).,btohqsg
Will have dp in a few days... So far no negative dp according to@MelvynEzi.,btohqsg
can FAST also  so long purpose chosen from dropdown list is salary crediting,btohqsg
As long as the amount got earmarked and cash credit received on 30th Aug. You can pull out the rest of your funds leaving the earmarked value alone there till December. Will not be penalized right?,btohqsg
"For the uob 30 days prior clause  it is not difficult to enforce as all uob needs to do is determine outflow of funds. So if you had 150k withdrawn any day in jun (leaving $0)  any funds between 0-150k deposited during promo period (1 jul to 30 sep) will not be considered as incremental fresh funds  REGARDLESS of the source of $$.E.g after taking 150k in 1st june. You put it in HSBC. Now u trf $150k from ur webull acc into uob. Uob likely may intepret as a ""redeposit"" even though ur 150k didnt come from UOB acc originally.Just my own intepretation. Only UOB executives will know the specific fine print",btohqsg
New and old tnc says cannot (whether enforced or not I don‚Äôt know).Must maintain mab + earmark amount throughout entire promo.,btohqsg
Yes you are right if they want to enforce it 100% as written.But whether they can or will. Is another story which nobody knows the answer now.,btohqsg
Yup. Glad to know you also intepret it in the same manner.Just wanted to help those that are planning to make complicated moves to meet the criteria  which they may possibly regret,btohqsg
But T&Cs explicitly stated FAST is excluded.,btohqsg
I'm trying to buy S27 using SRS on POEMS BUT keep getting rejected with an exceed client limit error. Anyone knows who to solve this?,btohqsg
Need to have the same amount deposited in cash as collateral before order,btohqsg
I also think 100% like yours. GG liao.Feel like UOB taking advantage now. Hope they go leniently. üòÅ,btohqsg
Haha that's why we always suspect UOB don't 100% enforce t&c.,btohqsg
