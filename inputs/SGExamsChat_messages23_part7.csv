they tend to not realise that theres underprivileged ppl etc etc,btohqsg
hence they treat everyone like equals,btohqsg
its like telling aliens abt real life and theyâ€™re like ooo but isokay weâ€™re all happy idk,btohqsg
HDB bakery waffles & Angmo waffles can fight. Both are elite to me,btohqsg
depends how insulated the students are,btohqsg
damn i never knew about the waffle socioeconomic gap,btohqsg
my friend told me once that,btohqsg
the teachers garnered everyone in a circle,btohqsg
and asked each student ti say their parents income,btohqsg
i think itâ€™s more like hdb waffles  is pancake batter in a waffle shape,btohqsg
most of the kids were shocked there were parents earning less than few k a month,btohqsg
how many is a few k,btohqsg
so shld be less than 3k loh,btohqsg
i think it was to demonstrate smth i wldnt know,btohqsg
with rgs move to the campus it probably lowered,btohqsg
i cannot comment further because i am not a Student of Raffles Institution,btohqsg
one dude is money max and smth ceo son or wtv,btohqsg
I tell you my experience about elitist mindset at Raffles. Not all  but a decent chunk of them have this mentality.The elitism comes in 2 forms:1. The first kind are those that come from regular households. Only difference is that theyâ€™re smart (legit smart  like can teach the teacher smart de). They do well in studies and life because theyâ€™re smart (and some hard work  but mostly smart).So they see other ppl donâ€™t do well and they think why donâ€™t they just work hard? Or be smarter? They donâ€™t realize how much winning the genetic lottery matters.You see a bunch of these types of elitists in top civil service.2. Second type of elitists are those born into already elite family  whether it is elite by wealth or status. From young  their social circle is almost entirely their type. They will do well in school because parents have resources for tuition  etc. they will also do well in life cos connections matter.For these elitists  theyâ€™re more ignorant of what other ppl go through. Like genuinely ignorant.So yeah itâ€™s basically these two types of elites.Disclaimer: Obv not all Raffles students are like that. Some just run Dishonest Bee.,btohqsg
another one is mnc ceoâ€™s son,btohqsg
thank you for your social class commentary sir,btohqsg
but not in a bad way imo,btohqsg
most of my friends were just,btohqsg
and their weekly allowance like less than 50 bucks per week,btohqsg
so they still be broke lmao,btohqsg
Yah. Like genuinely ignorant cos they really never were exposed to it.,btohqsg
also my fas friend didnt study at all until aâ€™s yr ðŸ¤© he do be clever tho,btohqsg
HOWEVER that wld be biased opinion of me,btohqsg
only one dude ik who aint too rich,btohqsg
i havent rlly met any other rafflesia living in hdb all,btohqsg
Yah. A lot of raffles kids are like this. They fail exams purely for lack of effort. Give them 2-3 months to work hard and they be knocking out the Aâ€™s easy,btohqsg
true leh  but I find hwa chong ppl more snobbish than raffles,btohqsg
hE LITERALLY CUT OFF MOST OF HIS FRIENDS AND PHONE WHEN HE CHIONGED IN Y6,btohqsg
Yah not surprising   HC basically draws on the same ppl of ppl as Raffles,btohqsg
i wont say a lot la  some also,btohqsg
based on ppl i know from raffles in my internship + raffles students im teaching now,btohqsg
there are raffles ppl who are unknowingly snobbish  but they actually arent  just that they don't realise they are,btohqsg
hwa chong ppl are straight up flexxors,btohqsg
just passed by a hc couple,btohqsg
but they holding hands in uni ðŸ¥´,btohqsg
got some degree of truth and falsehood,btohqsg
im more affected by the fact that good grades equals getting away with moral misdeeds,btohqsg
also some flex but they donâ€™t exactly know,btohqsg
like they post on ig all,btohqsg
I like how all this suddenly serious conversation started cos I posted about Dishonest Bee guy,btohqsg
i guess elitism kind of needed in non elite schs to some extent,btohqsg
or else they will become more irrelevant,btohqsg
wow awesomei love to read things like this,btohqsg
Your ATTEMPT at a joke haha,btohqsg
Whenever i need a joke  i look at the mirror,btohqsg
"i dont get why singaporeans let people with good grades get away with rubbishe.g. my friend was dating this tinder guy and he treat her like shit but she keep saying ""but wah he from this elite sch in this elite course leh""",btohqsg
