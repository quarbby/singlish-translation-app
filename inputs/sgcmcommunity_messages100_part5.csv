thinking if it's worthwhile to have it done at jb?,btohqsg
Not worth the time.Sometimes they don't carry the product.Sometime don't know it's real or fake. Product.Or kena upsell something you don't need.The price is about there in Singapore. Not really expensive üëç,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a triangle for these kinds of things‚Ä¶might not be the right triangle of things for workshops and car stuff but look at this and choose 2.In any case  your car is as much an investment as anything else. You‚Äôre spending a minimum SGD50k on your car. Is saving the extra $50-100  maybe even $200 doing it for cheaper worth it when you‚Äôre putting 50k at stake? You cheap out and do it for a bargain in JB  like other Aaron said  product may be used/refurbished/fake  you‚Äôre betting that savings you have that your investment into your car will pan out.,btohqsg
Its the time of the season alr....OH IT ALREADY DECEMBER üò±,btohqsg
Rather than anti-roll bar  why not do your suspension setup instead. My 51 year old granny can tackle that corner at 50 without an issue.,btohqsg
ARBs or sway bars would make the ride a bit too stiff if it‚Äôs just that alone,btohqsg
BMW's all new X1 with even stronger proportions is now available in Singapore üòçBMW has launched the new X1  which charms with an angular and bold design  and above all  a powertrain that falls within the Cat A COE limitations.‚û°Ô∏è Read ithere!,btohqsg
It is not the most effective solution to the problem**,btohqsg
To me it feels like:request: I want to go faster at a corneranswer: sure  ADD A TURBO,btohqsg
ARBs alone itself makes the ride shit LOL,btohqsg
