Is it true that like in the workplace you have no real friends??,btohqsg
The politics in poly are like,btohqsg
Constantly worrying about people backstabbing anf all that,btohqsg
People can be shitting u behind ur back,btohqsg
Help lahhhhh my friend joined me in the ponf,btohqsg
Now my fishes gonna die even more,btohqsg
Guys  I've a questionIs SUSS a private university or under government?,btohqsg
Some of the people I‚Äôve met so far are really quite nasty,btohqsg
most people still think its private,btohqsg
How on earth do you balance though,btohqsg
once u go part time u cant go back full time,btohqsg
i dont have much free time to socialise,btohqsg
Not like there‚Äôs much socialising in 2021 anyways,btohqsg
Then what's the minimum GPA score in order to get into SUSS?,btohqsg
what? is just a person no?,btohqsg
Ur family dislikes ur DSA offer   but only accepts it because their fren chikd in that school and tells u that they Get in with results versus u,btohqsg

He promo also in the uni freshman server ah,btohqsg
ngl I think I'm grateful my parents didn't grow up in Singapore  because now they never really had super high expectations for me  the same way Singaporean parents might have for their kids,btohqsg

low tier jc then low tier la HAHAHAH,btohqsg
90rp in yijc is the same as 90rp in hci,btohqsg
It‚Äôs how much hardwork u put in,btohqsg
contrary to popular belief sch resources not so good =/= cant do well,btohqsg
actl frm what i heard  jp has a fair share of ppl getting 9-12 points,btohqsg
sometimes Idk why ppl care so much abt schools tbh,btohqsg
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è that's just how SG culture is,btohqsg
Wait am I supposed to have a real name here üòÇ,btohqsg
Some of my relatives care q abit,btohqsg
Gg was MI the closest sch to u?,btohqsg
Oh I thot most people want to complete Alevels faster,btohqsg
I alr got a age gap,btohqsg
Uhhh tbh schools really do matter,btohqsg
Because something I noticed from studying with students from literally every caliber from P5 till now is that culture has a HUGE impact on your development,btohqsg
every sch is a good school -pm lee,btohqsg
perhaps the good students already are good in the first place,btohqsg
but can I ask u smth,btohqsg
I‚Äôll believe him when the ministers begin sending their children to poly,btohqsg
bruh what are u implying üíÄ,btohqsg
top sch w shit score or worst sch w bettter score,btohqsg
Tdy education minister come my sch haha,btohqsg
poly is a good school too,btohqsg
usually with a shit score u cant go to a good sch?,btohqsg
Definitely top school with garbage score,btohqsg
nono what if u got into a good sch,btohqsg
if its the same basis aka like alevels  then the latter,btohqsg
but i do believe there will be interviews and other things,btohqsg
Because then you can network with a ton of top students,btohqsg
so they hv to consider other factors like how the person is  their traits etc,btohqsg
but what if the student from the worst sch has attachments from good company,btohqsg
I feel like people make more connections in the atas schs. Maybe outdated but Raffles medical grp is a company set up by rafflesians,btohqsg
and students from top sch doesnt have,btohqsg
they js feel bad for jc students having to study mostly useless things üíÄüíÄ/lh,btohqsg
The whole team came from NP BA,btohqsg
then Ye they would have an advantage,btohqsg
I think the connections are the biggest adv but that's more of the raffles hc and acs crowd imo,btohqsg
Im saying those cuz my bestfriend is from ite and he has btr intern companies then me,btohqsg
His name is literally on the pillar on the first floor of block 72,btohqsg
like i said other factors come into play,btohqsg
Wait which school are you from?,btohqsg
other factors more important than school,btohqsg
the successor course of np ba,btohqsg
Marketing is the most popular specialisation in there,btohqsg
its true that more people wanna go poly now,btohqsg
my senior went to human capital,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the one I‚Äôve heard the least about,btohqsg
but thats because i think they know what they wanna pursue,btohqsg
i went to jc cuz i didnt know what i wanted to do with my life,btohqsg
Btw which one of the PLP modules are you going for??,btohqsg
theres this article that said 50% of students pick poly over jc despite being able to qualify for both,btohqsg
I chose the entrepreneurship modules for everything,btohqsg
gg to my jc was my biggest regret ngl,btohqsg
wait then why didnt u js go npbs,btohqsg
i almost wanted to transfer to poly,btohqsg
I sometimes consider that as well,btohqsg
i only realised what i wanted to do in the middle of j1,btohqsg
It‚Äôs another type of terrible here,btohqsg
But the grass is always greener on the other side ig,btohqsg
You have to worry about politics instead of only grades,btohqsg
now im having kinda clearer picture of what career i wanna pursue,btohqsg
just dont make the wrong decision then end up regretting,btohqsg
for the epic uni admission its a sacrifice,btohqsg
Idw go business sch thou haha,btohqsg
i thinking of transferring course too so,btohqsg
gg to my jc was big regret but i dont regret not transferring out,btohqsg
every sch got toxic sides imo,btohqsg
Any competitive course will have politics,btohqsg
Unless if you go to like,btohqsg
Starting over is a pain after all,btohqsg
i thought you said your course chill üíÄ,btohqsg
I think almost all sch got that,btohqsg
also@sefffzare ur classmates very onz in tutorials,btohqsg
btw is nvr too l8 to go poly cuz got like part time poly,btohqsg
I got backstabbed by one guy for BSA,btohqsg
but yes jc is super competitive nowadays  tbf poly has its competitive side too,btohqsg
aft uni if u see a cat in uni,btohqsg
But generally the only module where tutorials are important is BSA,btohqsg
some 26 point course may be a 26 point course cos of large intake,btohqsg
Poly is consistent effort after all haha,btohqsg
but do they fight to answer questions and all,btohqsg
im thnakful my class q chill in that aspect,btohqsg
so if ppl know then they ans,btohqsg
If we got GPA in jc I think we legit die,btohqsg
cos i heard some classes in poly legit tryhard,btohqsg
bruh yes the gpa system has no mercy,btohqsg
Econs in my sch 1.1% A,btohqsg
in some cases 1 mark = 1 grade,btohqsg
I heard that the whole rivervalley cohort,btohqsg

no one talks in class chats frm experience,btohqsg
my batch i rmb for mye in j2 ah if u get U youre like 20-40 percentile,btohqsg
i got a C and i was in like 80-100 percentile,btohqsg

GP i get E i 0-20 percentile HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA,btohqsg
i wouldnt say either is better,btohqsg
I got E I'm 40-60 haha,btohqsg
but it rlly depends on what ur subject combi is,btohqsg
and whether u can cope 4 H2,btohqsg
Honestly I doubt alot of people can cope with 4H2s,btohqsg
just drop math to h1 lmao,btohqsg
unless u planning to pursue smth that needs math,btohqsg
Some say h2 math easier leh,btohqsg
essay 29 is pretty good alrdy eh,btohqsg
cuz my sch right alot of arts ppl drop to h1,btohqsg
its way harder  but the moderation to get A wont be as crazy as H1,btohqsg
for H1 u literally have to like get full marks,btohqsg
