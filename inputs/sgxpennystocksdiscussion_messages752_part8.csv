Once susp  the only alternative is to find new investors for capital injection or RTO. No matter which  existing shareholders will suffer big dilutions and likely get back pennies to their cost. Maybe 5% get lucky but cannot recount who.,btohqsg
Best world is one but their susp not because of financial issues but regulatory issues,btohqsg
Ya sia. I went to see see. 1-2 bedroom very hot.,btohqsg
Boldtek have property assets which are paid for .Once sell off  there is cash flow,btohqsg
The bulk of their assets are contract assets  which remain uncertain to realize full amounts if they face cash flow issues. The other major asset is investment property. Also they have borrowings to settle. Cash is really low.,btohqsg
