Mmm not sure if this might help but,btohqsg
Im panicking bc of another thing,btohqsg
ftr my RP was low 60s so,btohqsg
Once you have your back up plan,btohqsg
Then i ask my mom tdy we quarrel,btohqsg
29 is the equal chance date,btohqsg
No Im applying to lower tier ones for guaranteed admission,btohqsg
oh shitso need to take STEP the year before?,btohqsg
I almost thought I failed but somehow i passed,btohqsg
thats an entire h1 A difference away from me,btohqsg
idr but oxbridge apps close quite early so when you're in jc make sure to keep track,btohqsg
should i concentrate on US or should i also apply for UK,btohqsg
right now i'm preparing for sat in 2 years,btohqsg
my dude is doing his doctorate in physics now,btohqsg
And where did u go too,btohqsg
he will be dr si yan soon,btohqsg
I am an undergrad in physics,btohqsg
well UK is just personal statement mainly + whatever tests for relevant unis,btohqsg
so it's not that much work tbh,btohqsg
since it's all under the UCAS portal,btohqsg
Though tbh i also cld have attended nus but i decided to not to do so,btohqsg
hmm .. do I need to grind extracurriculars as well (olympiads etc.)  besides achieving perfect academics?,btohqsg
the US requires a lot of extracurriculars,btohqsg
i'm in my 7th year in ntu now. 4 years undergrad -> 3rd year of phd,btohqsg
or you work a bit first then go back to study,btohqsg
Yea but I wld say at the end of the day,btohqsg
Will yall retake on the exact same year when u collect results,btohqsg
No one wld rlly care much abt what jc you go to,btohqsg
Or even what a levels you have,btohqsg
ok for UK it's really just grades  employment history if any  and personal statement. extracurriculars are mainly to help you write the statement since they tend to like those that show off the depth of knowledge and skills you have,btohqsg
from there you can get invited to an interview + any technical tests,btohqsg
Maybe i wld try to retake once,btohqsg
if you dont retake in the same year,btohqsg
i alr registered to retake a levels while in ns before ntu accepted me,btohqsg
means you're potentially wasting 1.5 years?,btohqsg
then i forgot to get the refund for it,btohqsg
"so now my singpass has a second a level results with 4 ""Absent"" grades",btohqsg
like hell nah just retake in the same year while the knowledge is still fresh in your head,btohqsg
Is possible to get a job with an A levels while studying A levels,btohqsg
i mean definitely  if person has enough self discipline,btohqsg
but if i got a job i would be so tired i cant even think about studying,btohqsg
because cheong siew ann wanted him,btohqsg
bc i alr got into ntu and i couldn't be bothered to retake,btohqsg
i'm not kidding when i said i did not care,btohqsg
imagine studying GP + 3H2 again,btohqsg
For me i wld do all though,btohqsg
my a levels fuck up was not bc i couldn't do it,btohqsg
i literally did not bother to study,btohqsg
thank god the 70rp thing happens next year,btohqsg
what makes you think my retake would've been better,btohqsg
i wont make it to ntu say fr,btohqsg
You cld try just for fun :D,btohqsg
and the funniest thing is i barely/never studied for my H1s...,btohqsg
i might do it this year for fun,btohqsg
To lower the bell curve :D,btohqsg
Yall dont wanna know how rusty my organic chem is,btohqsg
write all your answers late by one question,btohqsg
gotta give them poor jc kids a break,btohqsg
Speaking of which fren EAE but raw 8 lmao,btohqsg
ntu physics  did p well there,btohqsg
Yea I was the hardcore mugger in my jc,btohqsg
I was hardcore nervous at that time,btohqsg
btw i've had people from this gc that dk me at all,btohqsg
Oh  can I know which one,btohqsg
dm me saying i'm lying about my stuff,btohqsg
you definitely did not teach quantum mechanics to me before,btohqsg
think the other end of the spectrum,btohqsg
TJC is all the way to the east,btohqsg
i died sia bc they're those that legit dk me at all,btohqsg
would've if you did well for qm 2,btohqsg
hey done well is a relative term,btohqsg
i think i did p well,btohqsg
I shld have done btr for qm 2,btohqsg
it wasnt a fail  thats a win in my books,btohqsg
Gonna get 100% for qm 3 fr,btohqsg
im gonna jump straight to qm4,btohqsg
I mean. You did say you wanted him to pass.,btohqsg
i wanted him to get at least a B,btohqsg
but i p much dragged him across the finish line,btohqsg
unironically a B wouldve pulled up my gpa,btohqsg
I cannot imagine how you wld havr done thag,btohqsg
not me failing both mid terms,btohqsg
now i can say it and laugh,btohqsg
but i actually did fail both LMAO and it was depressing,btohqsg
while everyone was getting like 80 and 90 for mt2,btohqsg
i sat down with him and zy for 2 out of 4 quizzes to make sure they can do it,btohqsg
I tried to ask my ta for 1 mark once :D,btohqsg
Wait i dont think youre the only person tho,btohqsg
nah there are people way worse,btohqsg
i havent heard of anyone failing qm2 though,btohqsg
maybe im not talking to the right people,btohqsg
wait like F in the transcript?,btohqsg
i feel like i should be the benchmarks for things  like if you get lower than me  something is wrong,btohqsg
I wld say it isnt THAT low,btohqsg
but only F is a fail though,btohqsg
D / D+ is still a pass,btohqsg
I have seen ppl not showing up...,btohqsg
i was thinking of people who showed up and still failed,btohqsg
prof himself told me it’s super hard for him to fail someone unless they legit don’t even try,btohqsg
I tot uni dam hard one,btohqsg
Well I had a poly classmate from mi 😅😅,btohqsg
The best part about uni is you get to customise the way you approach it,btohqsg
you can relax for the whole 13 weeks and start panicking during finals season (aka me),btohqsg
or you can consistently study and not panic during finals season,btohqsg
but obviously you gotta be adult enough to deal with the drawbacks lmao,btohqsg
thats why my gpa cant even buy chicken rice no mo,btohqsg
maybe can buy south spine duck rice,btohqsg
okay nah thats a bit too low,btohqsg
i relax and don’t panic in finals,btohqsg
Im just snacking on peanut crackers💀,btohqsg
i thought the prof was already nice enough to be repeating questions in his finals so that nobody can fail it,btohqsg
Actly how old is the prof btw,btohqsg
Oh actually i wanted to pee,btohqsg
fking zoom ass lesson at 1030,btohqsg

HOW 😭to go makan  i need to walk 10 minutes down to the main block,btohqsg
Excessive snacking of dingo made me FET,btohqsg

if you’re referring to that girl,btohqsg
$20 ramen? Take my money no thoughts,btohqsg
I KNOW WHAT U GONNA SAY,btohqsg
Years of problems at school have destroyed my desire for relationships but on the other hand it built me a different rs with H2 Math 😅😅,btohqsg
"""A boy and a girl are sitting at a bench.""",btohqsg
If the mean rate of school shooting in America is 2.6 times per week and follows a Poisson Distribution.Calculate the probability that 9 school shootings happen in 4 weeks.,btohqsg
Quite easy I guess just plug in to formula,btohqsg
"depends how badly is ""badly""?For me  Cambridge A-Levels was expensive in my Malaysia.It will take me like RM 5-10k+ just to resit for 2-4 subjects.I scored BBCD  C in Physics  and D in Maths.Forced to enroll into my local Malaysian ""Private"" University  and start over from scratch.😂 Managed Graduated with first class honors with a CGPA 3.86?/4.00 in EEE.",btohqsg
If your grades are the bare minimum  like a chain of Bs and Cs.I guess  you can explore to Malaysia's Private Universities? 😂An Engineering Degree costs about RM 80k (low/UTAR) to RM 250k (high/Monash) for International Students.Also Malaysia's Gov. Uni like UM/USM/UTM generally like to accept International Students with lower grades requirements  just to improve their QS Ranking for diversity. But hopefully you won't need to deal with problematic lecturers who only speaks Malay. lol.,btohqsg
don't remind me of Peggy. I think she failed like 3x and retain many yrs before she passed out from engineering,btohqsg
Apparently Johor's UTM have Undergrad programs for international students. RM 50k to 70k quite cheap.https://admission.utm.my/programme-fees-ug-international/,btohqsg
anyways time passes by faster than anything else,btohqsg
when i want to sit down and study  i realised it's already past 11pm,btohqsg
It's brush teeth then change i thought or maybe bath,btohqsg
if it is that's good ok la.In general I won't spent more than $10 in Singapore.I kennot brain how Singapore food prices so expensive.,btohqsg
morning routinebrush teethwash facechange clothestidy upincludes walking down to campus,btohqsg
by the time i finish my morning routine  i'm deadass late,btohqsg
pov: engineering block is the furthest away,btohqsg
yeah  all the engineering students here learn advanced stuff,btohqsg
ain't this supposed to be more of a diploma type of syllabus,btohqsg
im planning to abuse my student rights to get a licence,btohqsg
preps you for resilience on the 3 more years of bashing in NTU/NUS,btohqsg
i would rather be thrown into summer camp,btohqsg
ok but it's not too bad per se,btohqsg
pretty much the whole school shares the same lunch break,btohqsg
lol I find it funny they can't house these two fields into one campus lol,btohqsg
so many  yet so little space,btohqsg
Typically is how many students per intake?,btohqsg
I saw about 40-50 students per class during orientation,btohqsg
there's at least 4 schools here,btohqsg
its ok until you realise there's literally not much space to sit down and eat,btohqsg
there's 49 applicable courses in ite so farone course can have up to 5 classes,btohqsg
My uni used to have this amount  managed to squeeze 15k students in a 20 acres plot of land. 😂,btohqsg
that's still bigger than ite central,btohqsg
if you only count the accessible blocks,btohqsg
20/2  because it's both headquarters and college,btohqsg
either you guys have really nice facilities and big classrooms. 😂until you can't fit every one in a 20 acres of land,btohqsg
"same thing as mine  mine consists of student housing  University ""hotel""  car parking buildings 😂",btohqsg
Were the carpark building restricted access?,btohqsg
it's  RM1/hour parking (capped at RM 5/day).,btohqsg
so most richer students normally drive  because KL public transport is useless lol,btohqsg
ahh  to me it seems small compared to other Malaysian Private University campuses.,btohqsg
went to NUS last year... god damn its huge...,btohqsg
and then ntu is even bigger,btohqsg
😂 have rental bicycle there ah? I scared I walk until my legs patah weh.,btohqsg
Happy Chinese New Year Eve! How is CNY celebrations in your school today?,btohqsg
My sch dont allow me in😔,btohqsg
I was invited back for the CNY celebration of my school after O Level results release as one of the price recipient back then,btohqsg
The roads too dangerous for that,btohqsg
I assume most ppl in this group chat celebrating cny either in school or home. I not visiting relatives 😅,btohqsg
Coz of some past disputes regarding my grandmother,btohqsg
BMTC Cookhouse Festive Menu (from Facebook) Color Pepper Brown Rice  Baked Chicken With Lemongrass and Coriander  Steamed Fish With Ginger and Lemon  Stir-fry Xiao Pei Chye with Abalone and Mushroom  Braised Tang Hoon with Crabmeat and Tau Kee Soup. Pineapple Tarts and two Oranges for Desserts.,btohqsg
Meant more like jae results not out yet but dammm,btohqsg
If I am not wrong the relatives tried to push the responsibility of taking care of my grandma to my dad when they are clearly in a better financial position to take care of her,btohqsg
To tell you all my parents married without support from grandma,btohqsg
Oh dear  hope all is well,btohqsg
Family disputes regarding money have became increasingly frequent the past few years - numerous examples from Straits Times on changing the will of the deceased  etc,btohqsg
So whether I should have any feelings for grandma is debatable uh,btohqsg
Today's CNY eve  so mostly only reunion dinner,btohqsg
My parents married with friends serving as official witnesses at ROM,btohqsg
Lol so I think it make sense I totally don't feel anything for grandma that is,btohqsg
About that ... it was even worse these days uh especially when some ppl get into sham marriages to either help someone else for money or hide their sexual orientation,btohqsg
I was on r/sgexams some gay dude asking if can marrying lesbian to get bto flat and hide his gay orientation,btohqsg
I had to explain the legal implications,btohqsg
He was too simple minded thinking is just a simple process   marriages assumes many things uh like determine asset allocation post death and the so-called official wife might have legal rights to challenge the written will,btohqsg
I explained to him and he gave up the idea basically to prevent this messy chaos later on. I am tolerant towards lgbt community too.,btohqsg
Just be straight can already. No such problems,btohqsg
Transgender inmate SUES Trump — over only two genders executive orderShe’s arguing that moving her to an all male prison is against her ‘LGBT rights’#Trump2025,btohqsg
I am straight but still getting gf is tough haha 😄,btohqsg
So I don't quite bother   my parents practically pay zero attention to my relationship matters,btohqsg
Hahaha - anyone who wants a partner should go and put themselves out in the open. They should also have whatever qualities they want in their partner  as psychology proves people who look like each other somehow has higher likelihood of getting together,btohqsg
Well I tried to but the result wasn't  good to justify it,btohqsg
I keep getting surprised by the fact that army camps order ice cream,btohqsg
first time see RT news here,btohqsg
Some of my materials have been published under my real name for the secondary purpose of indirectly getting me into relationships haha but it doesn't work so the idea is not working,btohqsg
I saw it was working for my project partner though ... she published under her real name and it indirectly got her a bf,btohqsg
Haha not like it will make a difference,btohqsg
US prison system is quite fair to both genders,btohqsg
no one cycles within University Campuses?,btohqsg
U cycle daily it increases your risk of death by a significant percentage,btohqsg
A Singaporean who went viral after claiming she was nearly abducted at a shopping mall in Johor Bahru has been fined for making a false police report.She alleged that a man and woman approached her to smell Chinese tea leaves  which caused her to feel dizzy and stiff.https://str.sg/kvUX,btohqsg
Traffic from Uni Halls to Uni Campuses (LTs) that horrible?Until you guys can't cycle?,btohqsg
or just Singapore heat is just too hot to ride a bicycle 😂,btohqsg
U wanna smell my tea leaves,btohqsg
Dude she looks ugly af ain't no body wanna kidnap her,btohqsg
She's wasting the time of the police,btohqsg
Woman built like the female version of clown from IT,btohqsg
she think she can get away with anything in Malaysia,btohqsg
No way she tryna mess with the RMP,btohqsg
So that's why the face was familiar,btohqsg
Under law   if a pilot declares a fake emergency over radio   he/she can get fined too,btohqsg
I heard the fine is 20k to 200k usd,btohqsg
Police got better things to do than to handle clown from IT,btohqsg
They went through cctv cam and determined the report is fake?,btohqsg
Coz I know pilot declaring fake emergency can determine using cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder as evidence,btohqsg

"but then if you walk by a tea leaf seller shop  do you expect they normally ""drug"" you lol.",btohqsg
Are NUS and NTU super different? Jst curious,btohqsg
one more ulu then the other,btohqsg
that’s too broad of a question,btohqsg
also wdym by it looks the same lmao,btohqsg
I wld say maybe ntu is approaching similarity to nus,btohqsg
Tbh all unis are similar to some extent,btohqsg
Esp with like the fgo thingy  introducing icc mods(interdisciplinary)  ureca  etc,btohqsg
But yea they arent fully the same,btohqsg
So i mean what kinda and what answer,btohqsg
But yea honestly if you said ntu and nus are the same  i feel like a higher proportion of nus ppl wld be offended,btohqsg
Well   keeping device up to date is the one way to keep device safe uh,btohqsg
I used Windows at home as well as Linux in school (I study IT) and can tell you no device is 100% hack proof 😂😂,btohqsg
my phone idk whens the last update,btohqsg
Go to settings and check out latest updates,btohqsg
Being IT student  it is a good practice to get os updated as soon as update is up online,btohqsg
🤣 have ..my friend also said the same thing,btohqsg
Like gd friends ballot the hse and stay,btohqsg
after that can sell and buy their hse as single,btohqsg
You mean they in sham marriages,btohqsg
🤣 like real gd friends la,btohqsg
But that's if u can get real buddy 🤣,btohqsg
but my pc every other week got some sort of update,btohqsg
Any friends study legal ? From poly to uni?,btohqsg
So they married but in reality friends only ?,btohqsg
Many months ago I encountered reddit post,btohqsg
On a person involved in sham marriages with another person,btohqsg
But immigration officers wasn't able to detect anything suspicious uh,btohqsg
Reason she and her fake husband live together in same house 😅😅😅,btohqsg
They have same registered address which makes it difficult for custom officer to detect sham marriages,btohqsg
Think have uh but Google it,btohqsg
I apparently don't use iPhone haha but I think there should be a button for iPhone devices to detect download and install updates,btohqsg
Lol then the updates not yet out lol,btohqsg
Note 10 think out of support?,btohqsg
My friend use his old phone as file server,btohqsg
Phone are typically supported for 4 to 6 years when updates are a concern,btohqsg
At least newer ones are pushing for it,btohqsg
But android oso easier to use a diff os,btohqsg
Overshadowed by pixel 4a battery updates,btohqsg
as an sysadmin  it is good practice to ensure the OS update is stable before updating  least it blows up prod,btohqsg
aka I update like 5 times a year,btohqsg
That's why gt Windows Lts 😅,btohqsg
Linux is good but not invincible too,btohqsg
I used redhat in school before,btohqsg
Then if anyone here interested to build a computer and dw spend $ on Windows can try a Linux os,btohqsg
Arch is not user friendly if I rmbr correctly,btohqsg
im at my relatives hse for reunion dinner,btohqsg
and everyone here is either below 20 or above 50,btohqsg
Except this yr most likely not going other ppl houses,btohqsg
I had mine yesterday...was so full 🤣,btohqsg
I'm the only one below 25 here,btohqsg
Got two kids below 5 yrs old and here I'm with my bro that are teens,btohqsg
only me my sister and my cousin is below 20,btohqsg
No choice but we talking to the elderly 😂,btohqsg
anyone retaking priv candidate for O's here,btohqsg
My ah gong house got a starry night piece,btohqsg
If y'all bored at cny gathering  try thisIs this statement correct,btohqsg
the phrasing alone is annoying me,btohqsg
Person A: $30Person B: $0Person A: $12Person B : $18Person A: $52Person B: -$22?,btohqsg
Am I doing something wrong here,btohqsg
Congrats  you solved it 👏Person A profits $22,btohqsg
Person C : i have no money,btohqsg
У меня тоже нет денег! (Literally I also have no money ) 😂😂,btohqsg
needs more seafood. abit too watery imho.,btohqsg
Well I bought a levels math books and had to consider budget first 😅😅,btohqsg
where's your relative in between the 20 to 50 range?,btohqsg
ohhh. normal then. Unless your family reunion dinner was on last weekend.,btohqsg
then most of the people should technically make it.,btohqsg
I realise that can use a level Mathematics book to grind for Poly stats module uh   for those in Poly or contemplating Poly education   I gave you all a great hint on how to study for stats in certain cases,btohqsg
😂 what you study in Poly for your diploma? and What degree you aim in Uni?,btohqsg
Business stats in Poly under IT course,btohqsg
tbh  most of the Maths you learnt won't be reused.And typically Diploma Maths are really watered down lol,btohqsg
You planning to transition back to Computer Science in your Degree?,btohqsg
I study Probability   conditional Probability   Bnomial Distribution  Poisson  normal distribution and T,btohqsg
This would be easier if you just get a Free Cambridge International A-Level Mathematics 9709 Syllabus textbook lol.,btohqsg
Almost the same as a levels just with slightly reduced difficulties,btohqsg
pretty sure you can Google the eBook online.,btohqsg
"but it won't be written for ""Business"" examples.",btohqsg
Those going Poly   check your syllabus if similar to A levels stats syllabus  if yes   can grind already on A level books,btohqsg
I meant for the International Syllabus  since Physical Textbooks are bloody expensive lol,btohqsg
Well I imply if you can pass a level stats   definitely positive you can deal with Poly Business Stats or Biostatistics,btohqsg
ahh not sure do you really need it in your future work/degree.to me kinda like meh.I haven't seen a Bell curve Distribution graph for some time now.,btohqsg
Computer science I think need 🤔,btohqsg
My Poly GPA quite low so anything I would need job experience to make up for it to enter uni,btohqsg
The last time I saw it was my Graduate Trainee internship in Intel. Doing Testchip picking  where the fab screen through hundreds of chips.Sent use a sample of the batch.I just need to plot the data into a Bellcurve.,btohqsg
Then fab screen through the chip  the max frequency it can goes up to. *Then we just reclassify the chips for further functionality testing like is this a test chip performing below  nornmal  above speeds.,btohqsg
So you used it for chip engineering nice ...,btohqsg
"not really detailed stuff. but you kinda get the idea  if you want to classify your Chips speed by how many ""sigma"" standard deviations.",btohqsg
why say 2 $20 ? should just say $40 lol,btohqsg
Enjoy the cheap food and 🤣,btohqsg
Wait you intend to bring study materials?,btohqsg
I think you guys will be soon when I'm starting school soon 🤣,btohqsg
While I cried in tears 😮‍💨,btohqsg
BTW I think jc start school already right?,btohqsg
Ahh miss sec school days 😂😂,btohqsg
idr much of sec sch atp,btohqsg
But idk what you went through so,btohqsg
Can't comment  my sch back then lots of toxic ppl but at least my teacher isn't toxic,btohqsg
"Certain subjects in school never have ""gd friends""🤣",btohqsg
Yup graduated from Poly some time ago,btohqsg
My schoolmates created damn loads of trouble for others including me lol,btohqsg
Remember if your family driving a car  please pump RON97 gas if you driving a Singapore Plate car... 😂,btohqsg
Or is it legal compliance of sort ？,btohqsg
Ohh .... heard the johor sg rts gonna come up soon yeah,btohqsg
By then buses will go obsolete if the trains is punctual enough,btohqsg
nah. unless Johor-Singapore plans to remove border checks like the EU.,btohqsg
but I doubt that would happened. Then Singapore would be flooded with Cigarettes and illegal shit from Malaysia.,btohqsg
As the saying goes as long as it dun break down,btohqsg
i’d be happy if it’s just better than the german train line,btohqsg
just don’t wanna get fucked by DB,btohqsg
Wait how reliable is German railway ?,btohqsg
you don’t take the train if you want to be on time,btohqsg
Coz Japanese trains are punctual and reliable I heard,btohqsg
Like even if there is delay  is usually caused by acts of god like earthquake   storms and typhoons,btohqsg
There has been delays in Japan railway caused by factors well beyond the control of rail company,btohqsg
ahhh Trains in Europe aren't reliable...,btohqsg
Went to Amsterdam. It either always breakdown,btohqsg
Like vandalism of infrastructure or passenger fell on tracks either accidentally or intentionally,btohqsg
i only had issues with germany personally,btohqsg
Otherwise  you read the wrong Train  and it really brings you to Holland,btohqsg
Happy Chinese New Year and Holidays to everyone!,btohqsg
plus they always give $4 red packet,btohqsg
"could have top up to $5  ""4"" isn't a nice number lol",btohqsg
"unless they really ""meant"" it lol",btohqsg
FYI our mrt train set emu numbers dun start with 4 for nsewl,btohqsg
Isn't this on 31 December and paid using taxpayer money?,btohqsg
Must be in malaysia i think,btohqsg
Unrelated to academic but any cat lover here ? 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Was uploading cat photo taken many years agohttps://archive.org/details/catpicture_0010,btohqsg

No ppl visit is good..😆 I rather that way,btohqsg
you might need to sit for SATs for that.,btohqsg
🇺🇸 have to pass sats..but then again have to see which uni u apply for,btohqsg
If not reputable might as well study in sg with higher salary,btohqsg
i mean i’m beyond it alr,btohqsg
Mit sats need high score 🤣,btohqsg
There's no absolute SAT requirement at MIT  but they really want to see at least a 1520 to have a chance at being considered.🥹,btohqsg
Mark Zuckerberg graduated from Exeter in 2002. And he scored perfect 1600 in SA,btohqsg
i got a 1520 the first time i took it haha,btohqsg
ah did your parents put you on fast track or prodigy track or something lol.,btohqsg
isn't 1520+ avg for sg student,btohqsg
if I recalled correctly the max score for SAT is 1600.,btohqsg
you need a flawless paper bruh,btohqsg
your score sounds like 95% percentile already. lol,btohqsg
i'm in the bottom 25% of MIT applicants,btohqsg
"ah might be discounted if you aren't from a Chinese descent.If they want to accept students because of ""diversity"" background lol",btohqsg

"hmmm  as long you feel that doing 2 years of A-Level doesn't put you to another ""disadvantageous"" positions.Since no matter what after you finished Pre-U level certs. You die die need to do NS.",btohqsg
Currently you're 16 + 2 years A-levels -> 1919 then + another 2 years of NS -> 21Joining Uni at 21/22 -> + 3-4 years -> 25/26.,btohqsg

I feel like most people's impression of C-Dramas are shaped by the costume idol dramas  but China also makes some seriously good gritty dramas,btohqsg
