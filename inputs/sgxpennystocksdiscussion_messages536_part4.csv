‚åõÔ∏èPika World Breaking News Update- 21 September 2021üñ®With the continuing weakening of the equity market that started 2 weeks ago  the recent drama surrounding Evergrande adds fuel to the deterioration in the market.In this writing  Pika World believes that Evergrande turmoil is likely to settle down given that a resolution will need to be achieved either through what we perceived as a restructuring or outright liquidation  although we prefer the former.Let's get into the detail.üí∞The US Dollar Strength is a CatalystPika World is monitoring the strength of the dollar. In the early of the year  we initiated the contrarian view that the US dollar is expected to be firmer rather than weaker as most anticipated due to the rush of new debt by the US government.About 3 quarters into the year  we still see a strong dollar which is in line with our forecast. However  Evergrande's saga boldened the dollar strength  which presented a problem to the equity market.üíµStrong Dollar= Poor Purchasing Power for Global CommunityA strong dollar tends to dilute households and businesses' purchasing power. The weaker buying power suggests lower demand and poorer economic growth in a global environment still weighing down by Covid-19. This may further exacerbate the slowing growth narrative that has been singing for the 2nd month.üß≤What's the link between Evergrande and US Dollar?Here's the catch. Suppose we see many real-estate firms in China having an overleveraged situation  in which their stock prices are tanking due to concern of their indebtedness. In that case  there is a risk that Chinese banks which could potentially hold some of these debts face impairments due to the loan not being paid.This will cripple their balance sheet  although it is tough to ascertain which lender will be most hit at this stage.Psychologically  banks will be hesitant to lend to each other despite the PBOC lowering the interest rate or in the form of monetary easing to boost lending. Yet  by reducing the interest rate  the Yuan tends to weaken vs the dollar  despite government intervention to lessen the impact of such fall. On a relative term  therefore  we would see the dollar strengthening.At Pika World  we are shifting our attention beyond the current indebtedness and move our sight to the possible secondary effect that could further dampen the market.Thanks for reading  and we will see you in the next one.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

No wonder what... recovery play still intact...ü§îüòÇ,btohqsg
Economies/borders have to be reopen soon...,btohqsg
too many die fans  still keep supporting the price by buying in to average down  but when it drop  they will start to sell    cycle keep repeating,btohqsg
But whether will have something nice come out or not,btohqsg
Are you related to jack ma by any chance..,btohqsg

Positive news from both parent clearbridge and biolidics itself. Catalyst . And today is medical day too,btohqsg
I waiting see Livingstone got any run bo ..also medical,btohqsg
Buyer Seems started to accumulating at 28,btohqsg
Biolidics ran  Clearbridge might follow? Lets see,btohqsg
Seems long way to clear.. üòÄ,btohqsg
If Biolidics run further  Clearbridge should tag along,btohqsg
I tried some earlier test only. average close to0.118,btohqsg

yea  this counter alive only when they go above 132. otherwise sleeping,btohqsg
I scared to average down cos the music can suddenly stop and then have to hold the bag.  Kena once before  so just have to patiently wait for good samaritan to fry it up..again,btohqsg
true. Stay light   too many traps around.,btohqsg
Clearbridge will be forced to up as long as Biolidics is still holding up,btohqsg
Yea bro.  Market very hard to trade these days,btohqsg
Seem like everyone in cautious mode,btohqsg
This morning  when Bio chiong  I went to look at Clearbridge - no trades.  Then  suddenly  it went up,btohqsg
indeed. trade smaller perhaps and be nimble,btohqsg
got to hoot fast and then run fast when they move.,btohqsg
Last time  the run can stretch for a few days... like marathon. Now  is a sprint.,btohqsg
Yea if you aint a sprinter but am a long distance runner  best to wait for marathon to participate hah,btohqsg
