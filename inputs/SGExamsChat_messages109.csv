@cauchycriterionim curious what was the gender ratio for your f maths class,btohqsg
Thats why i was a bit confused when i saw nus math degree had about an even gender ratio,btohqsg
Why cant math degree have even gender ratio,btohqsg
Sure but it feels like a lot more guys like maths than girls,btohqsg
Haven't graduated yet  but it's surprising as well,btohqsg
In all my math mods  i see quite alot of girls though,btohqsg
Or u mean more males like maths as compaored to females,btohqsg
But then again right  applied math have quite a lot of girls though,btohqsg
Csuse i kinda inferred that since fm has a skewed ratio,btohqsg
Math degree would have it too,btohqsg
U want girls come to bio course,btohqsg
Compared to engineering and computing  math gender ratio is v gd,btohqsg
Yea sia fass is like orchard road,btohqsg
Showing that math appeals to both genders!,btohqsg
It's quite okay I guess  but not as good as I hope it is,btohqsg
All the computing ppl always go fass canteen to eat,btohqsg
Right that's true  and DSA also,btohqsg
I guess I take the same mods as them so I can't really tell if they are AM  DSA or whatnot,btohqsg
Yea u can judge from the level 1k-2k math mods,btohqsg
This is the ratio for ntu. Males on the left females right total furthest right,btohqsg
Alot are from stats dsa qf,btohqsg
Quite a number of girls in math are foreigners,btohqsg
Couldnt find nus math tho is it named undet anothet course,btohqsg
Ohh it's not too bad I guess  the gender ratio,btohqsg
Tbh I don't see that in nus math,btohqsg
At least within my limited experience so far,btohqsg
From what i heard the higher level mods got alot,btohqsg
What do they clsssify nus math as,btohqsg
As in my batch  I don't see a lot,btohqsg
But then in general  sci gender ratio v good la,btohqsg

Tbh I feel like computing is more of mother tongue lol,btohqsg
Learning the syntax of a programming language yeah  but programming ain't computer science,btohqsg
These kinds of stuff is com sci,btohqsg
Tbh once you pick up your first language the rest is easier to learn,btohqsg
Especially since you look at tutorials and you know which parts you can skip,btohqsg
I said something and I regretted it,btohqsg
Do u regret being a fish,btohqsg
There is usually always a path to where you want to be,btohqsg

Ya most of the topics still relevant,btohqsg
Cannot be for ten years right,btohqsg
Ss whats the change in syllabus?,btohqsg
The topics in old SS is not relevant liao,btohqsg
U can basically only do the SBQ,btohqsg
What so venice all these removed?,btohqsg
No SRQ topics are totally different,btohqsg
But bruh ur one only can do one year of SRQ,btohqsg
It’s almost all local shit now,btohqsg
And healthcare policies of US and Sweden,btohqsg
Then now SRQ is one compulsory qn only,btohqsg
Why bring in US and sweden now,btohqsg
Last time they compare with UK,btohqsg
now brexit they kick Uk out,btohqsg
Coz now UK one is trash? Idk,btohqsg
I mean like the SBQ all abt sg latest issue,btohqsg
Sweden one is completely free+US one is completely market based,btohqsg
like from haze to cyber to idk wtf,btohqsg
Then they show SG as the middle ground,btohqsg
They help subsidise but u still pay,btohqsg
Ye it used to be foreign stuff,btohqsg
Coz I remember doing SBQ about UK steel,btohqsg
that's why idk if this year will be wuhan,btohqsg
At least one or 2 years before,btohqsg
but u see ah teachers always say that,btohqsg
then this year he removal of chapts,btohqsg
They probably just need to edit out the CLTs,btohqsg
they said have to remove out it,btohqsg
Yea but SS only the security shit removed,btohqsg
So if they dun have any security shit set,btohqsg
Then it will still remain mah,btohqsg
It just depends on what they set lor,btohqsg
it can be globalization of covid,btohqsg
Coz they may not need to edit,btohqsg
Idt many study seriously for ss also,btohqsg
Mine was so ez to smoke,btohqsg
It’s some stupid extract where parents wanna give their baby the race of Chinese Indian Malay Eurasian,btohqsg
Now u can put multiple races,btohqsg

That’s what the exam paper is saying,btohqsg
Whats the policy to encourage parents to give birth to more children arh,btohqsg

This SRQ+TOV/LON SEQ helped me get A1 for humans,btohqsg

So like I would take that,btohqsg
My schoolmates go and predict TOV/LON,btohqsg
I only did ss sbq srq n hist sbq done,btohqsg
Coz it’s either Stalin or that,btohqsg
Stalin was longest one nvr come out and TOV is 2nd longest,btohqsg
Couldn’t believe Stalin was the one longest nvr come out as essay,btohqsg
Pretty sure it come out like later,btohqsg
Anyways I was just lucky bah,btohqsg
It’s like the easiest but rarely tested topic,btohqsg
Err it was hitler tho I thought,btohqsg
I know is one of them,btohqsg
Hitler was a soldier in WW1,btohqsg
Then he lost his testicle lor,btohqsg
who do yall prefer stalin or hitler,btohqsg
I prefer Queen Cersei  the First of Her Name  Queen of the Andals and the First Men  Protector of the Seven Kingdoms,btohqsg
Stalin pretty much isn’t rly a cult,btohqsg
Coz people connect USSR to Lenin more,btohqsg
Stalin is just this guy who ruled for very long,btohqsg
They literally killed a lot of people,btohqsg
But we all know Mao Zedong also killed a lot,btohqsg
Actually the cold war part was more interesting,btohqsg
The stalin and hitler stuff is like,btohqsg
Ye but they removing the CLT xd,btohqsg
So no more end of Cold War stuff,btohqsg
I thought clt is central limit theorem,btohqsg
The last topic of both papers are removed,btohqsg
I dun understand a thing abt coldwar,btohqsg
The cold war part was more interesting,btohqsg
Please la how many years alrdy,btohqsg
I can tell u idk anything abt book 2,btohqsg
Basically US help west Europe and USSR help east Europe and it’s a lot on capitalism vs communism,btohqsg
I sleep in history class de,btohqsg

They basically like make it more free,btohqsg
Then he fucked himself in the ass,btohqsg
I only studied for book 1,btohqsg
He basically allow freedom of speech,btohqsg
But also it’s coz they keep funding a lot of wars then their economy gg,btohqsg
Only if got econs in o level,btohqsg
I wont be suffering in history,btohqsg
So as good as dont have,btohqsg
The Os econs learn more than H1,btohqsg
H1 and h2 econs not much diff leh,btohqsg
