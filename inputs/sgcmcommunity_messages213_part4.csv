very rare to see Autorised Dealer renting brand new model for short-term rental. 2025 accord for $327/day is not it though.it is nice to see Authorised Dealer actually cater to the car enthusiasts  and list brand new models for short term rentalridiculous price though,btohqsg
agreed though selling price of 280k also very high,btohqsg
would be nice if more ADs also allow short term rental of brand new models,btohqsg
But but Honda Accord really that good that car enthusiasts want to try it? I thought Japan cars are all generally those boring long lasting ones and enthusiast cars are those racing types.,btohqsg
personally not me that want to try it. perhaps honda enthusiasts would try it,btohqsg
It's the Accord Euro R that's desired,btohqsg

Anyone has experience with stage one tuning? Will it damage cars or cause any issues? Thanks for sharing.,btohqsg
Short term no  long term probably. Cars are made to withstand a specific spec and load. Make it take higher load all the time will put more stress on the engine and gearbox. Was driving a stage 1 VW  non dsg version. Gearbox start giving problems on 7th year  had to overhaul. Engine and hoses start leaking too. Maybe it's just normal wear and tear  but I can't be sure...,btohqsg
