Honestly just down 30% snd get a bank loan,btohqsg
but there is always a possibility they charge astronomical interest rate,btohqsg
"thought i hearsay before that PPSL will buy in your car at an ""overpriced"" rate so that they can give you more loan percentage if inhouse  so technically your ""rebate offset"" for another car from them is lower price hence lower loan amount but it will be clawed back through further loan amendments.. not sure how it works",btohqsg
Think no business wants to lose their reputation by giving you fluctuating interest rate. But usually on the lapse of credentials results in higher interest rate. Cause they know you're desperate. Is either them or personal loan. Cause bank you sure fail.,btohqsg
Oh right cause banks check your profile,btohqsg
Dam so technically bank loans are the safest way to go,btohqsg
And if you take a in house loan theres always gonna always be that risk there,btohqsg
Increase price of car to increase loan value since you are only allowed 60-70% of loan value depending on OMV or ARF cant remember. So you can borrow 90% of the initial car value when the bank think its 70%.,btohqsg
But this is very easily traceable when they have to file gst,btohqsg
I notice also banks are more ‚Äúforgiving‚Äù if you late,btohqsg
Definitely. So bank loan either you apply yourself or dealer apply for you. Dealers usually have preferential bank rates,btohqsg
rare black paint and manual model,btohqsg
If apply yourself means go bank do it then like link with the dealer is it,btohqsg
i think army need teach financial literacy as a syllabus now,btohqsg
They buy your car at higher price with overtrade to offer you discount,btohqsg
it‚Äôs basically kia‚Äôs retarded korean cousin w a US passport,btohqsg
Not give you more loan percentage,btohqsg
Interest is usually fixed but high,btohqsg
Now upto 4.28 min for many,btohqsg
5.98 is the average that most people get,btohqsg
But the issue is that one has no equity in the car,btohqsg
So when you go off to sell it,btohqsg
You still owe a lot to the lender including your interest,btohqsg
But your car is not worth that much,btohqsg
no bro full loan a aveo,btohqsg
More so with used car dealers not new dealers,btohqsg
New dealers usually never offer full loans,btohqsg
Giving you equity in the car,btohqsg
honestly i think we wouldn‚Äôt troll the fella this hard if he had got back to us,btohqsg
60 to 70% of OMV/price of car,btohqsg
Never seen the group unite to help one fella,btohqsg
Late fees aren't as high if you are late,btohqsg
Assuming they do  then pls make sure they pass on the benefits to you.,btohqsg
I managed to get hong leong to forgive me for one late payment fee,btohqsg
I forgot my giro didn‚Äôt set up,btohqsg
You go bank do it  they will assess accordingly then once passed  they will disburse the funds to the dealer,btohqsg
For all people not just men,btohqsg
School should revamp s3x ed too,btohqsg
ndp rally should have a why u shouldn‚Äôt full loan a car,btohqsg
I am unsure of the sec school syllabus followed,btohqsg
But I assume it's outdate like most places,btohqsg
