and my guy friends agree w me,btohqsg
Lol I dont even know anyone using tinder... anyway I'm attached üòÖ,btohqsg
also ivy league doesnt mean shit?,btohqsg
it jsut means you're a good rule follower and was lucky your whole life,btohqsg
I guess you need to chill and be more positive instead of toxic,btohqsg
imagine dating people cuz of their education status tho,btohqsg
the whole concept of leagues is a bit wonky,btohqsg
i only date my bed sorry,btohqsg
"as drake said ""i only love my bed and my mama im sorry""",btohqsg
i was confessed to by no one ü§°,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure straight guys don't have a lot of matches just cause of the demographics,btohqsg
ive grown to realise telegram = tinder,btohqsg
Straight girls can be choosy on tinder,btohqsg
clearly guys are also very choosy,btohqsg
And if they're below your league you should match with them..?,btohqsg
Even i don't have setting option in my mobile,btohqsg
Anyway I'm of the opinion tinder doesn't really work,btohqsg
to prove to my friends tinder are shit for girls,btohqsg
tbh its bad to go to tinder cos ur deadass despo,btohqsg
thats why i create fake acc,btohqsg
but trolling is ok and fun,btohqsg
i have and will never download a dating app,btohqsg
screenshot proof to my clique to show how shit tinder is for girls,btohqsg
@meltedmangofrappehey the girls hmu first not the other way,btohqsg
I knew my partner from online and it's been 3 years but it's not tinder Lol,btohqsg
But tbh too tired to do so,btohqsg
but srs my tele is usually for just my close group of friends or work,btohqsg
"He meant ivy league as in ""ivy league of looks""",btohqsg
Ivy league in general la but I guess tinder is based more on looks isnt it?,btohqsg
Then youre looking for the wrong kind of person,btohqsg
i dont think anyone cares abt bio on tinder,btohqsg
A little silly to swipe based on looks and bio üòê,btohqsg
A 6.5 or a 6 has a good chance if the bio matches the girls interests,btohqsg
u can insult a race on tinder bio and be good looking and get more matches,btohqsg
It sure is  but thats also the allure,btohqsg
unless that guy/girl really damn despo,btohqsg
But to swipe is a little crude. maybe online catalogues based systems are  better,btohqsg
so ur saying caring abt personality more than looks is despo?,btohqsg
I think there are matchmaking sites like that!,btohqsg
He's saying if you ignore looks on first impressions you're desperate,btohqsg
I made sure I saw my current gf pics first before we met and I do agree it was looks first at that time but subsequently personality and work ethic and outlook on life long and short term matters a lot,btohqsg
dunno man probably more for guys,btohqsg
guys care abt looks first  everything else comes later,btohqsg
Like I was initially apolitical until recently been converted to pro Pap by her,btohqsg
Everything is subjective. For guys and for girls,btohqsg
I've had a couple of failed rs and  so ... personality does matter,btohqsg
Surprisingly there are many toxic people around...,btohqsg
Do looks not matter for females?,btohqsg
if a girl is ugly doesnt matter if she has a perfect personality  they wont consider,btohqsg
That is sadly true  and for the reverse too,btohqsg
