based off personal expif ur sch is unwilling to take action and they continue1. file a police case report(idk what its called) the police wont take action for now but at least theres a written record somewhere.document all evidences of ppl bullying you like text messages  a rough timeline  take pics of your bruises. document EVERYTHING.2.  if the dm dont want to take action  go up. contact your principal or vp. emphasise that your Mental health has been severely affected andyou have thoughts of harming yourself because of what they did to you. This will make them take it seriously (hopefully  at least based off my own exp and my friends exp. For yijc idk)3. If the school still dont care  social media is your best friend. make some anon reddit post on sgexams and watch as it blows up. or contact some youtuber  random mothership writer or whatnot and get them to write an article or some random ass post. anything goes. once it goes public  the sch is forced to take action.only use this as a last resort if the school REFUSES to take any actionhope it turns out well,btohqsg
you never told me the explicit details tho  i only know the volunteering incident,btohqsg
no shit im a rp student,btohqsg
my yijc frnds frm other classes all knows,btohqsg
they r the only onrs willing to help,btohqsg
my 3 fake friend sin my clsss,btohqsg
That's honestly the details as is alr even without screenshot thats how it went down,btohqsg
dude if u rlly cannot then just leave sch. if u can't leave then pon. there's no point going to sch if there isn't a safe and conducive space to learn and grow,btohqsg
im scared of gg to sch,btohqsg
