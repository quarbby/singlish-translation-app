Hi guys  any idea when Jurong West Crystal will be ready to move in,btohqsg
I think there's a DPD/EDPD for your understanding on when can you move in,btohqsg
Sorry question: For lease agreement signing  what do we need to prep in advance (documents etc)? I tried googling but doesn't seem to have anything...,btohqsg
Nric and cashier's order if you paying via cash. Both applicants must be present at the signing,btohqsg
When is your flat selection?Can email company HR and askI did so for mine although i had left the particular employer for nearly a year,btohqsg
Second appointment is to pay only deposit (5%??)EHG should have been credited into your CPF account by then  assuming that it was approvedBut i have no idea what happens if you want to cancel the flat application. Like  whether HDB will claw back the EHG amount from your CPF account,btohqsg
When are you expecting to get the keys?As in  flat readyIf not SBF or resale  you probably have more time for new BTO?Like  few years of wait  at leastBut will be quite a different scenario if downpayment is an issue,btohqsg
They have not credited EHG into my account yet cus i have outstanding rental amount cus of what stated above  my husband got retrenched. Currently living in rental  due to him being retrenched hence there's outstanding in my current rental flat,btohqsg
Almost everyone who booked the same flat already had their 2nd appt but i have not due to this.,btohqsg
As far as i learnt or listen to hearsay from different people's experiences these days  second appointment doesn't necessarily follow first appointment queue numberYour first appointment can be before mine but doesn't guarantee you must have your second appointment earlier than meThere were people who suggested that it could depend on the block and floor that you choose. Don't know how true but seems like EHG also plays a roleI belong to the HLE batch (still haven't figure out how HFE works yet)Anyway...Heard that EHG can be quite strictAssessment is supposed to be based on 12 months income prior to flat application BUT... There was a person who waited 12 months  had to furnish additional documents before EHG was approved and got his second appointmentHis experience was  second appointment scheduled 2 weeks after EHG approval + credit into his CPF accountSo  these days  whenever people say that they haven't gotten their second appointment  i will ask about the status of their EHGYou mentioned that they haven't credited the EHG into your account yet  so your EHG has been approved??Or  is it not yet approved  still KIV  rejected or you assumed it is approved but not yet given due to outstanding rental?About the EHG being strict  i also heard of another person who was employed for the 12 months but on unpaid leave for few months (AKA no income) and didn't get any EHG in the endAlso hearsay people mentioned that EHG application can be rejected if no work / income for even one month during the 12-month period,btohqsg
We got an email in regards to the EHG. They can't process the EHG unless we settle our outstanding rental fee amount.,btohqsg
The cannot process EHG is they already approved the amount but cannot disburse yet or they haven't confirm how much you will receive...?You can pm me if you prefer,btohqsg
I selected my unit in March this yearStill waiting for EHG approval but some people in my estate already went for their second appointment~~Gonna take it easy for now...Like how some people advised  let the CPF money continue to earn interest first,btohqsg
Hi  i am a late-joiner. Just to check  is there any toh guan grove telegram group chat?,btohqsg

Thanks for the reply! My wife and i actually filled up the google sheet some months ago but we weren't added into any group chats yet. So we were wondering if the group chat is still active.,btohqsg
After HFE letter approve & bto open up & get allocation number if no is good what's the next step?  Can see the Blocks & unit I'm can select?,btohqsg
"Wait for your appointment detailsAm the HLE generation thoughI could see the available units when i received information regarding my flat selectionCan also ""watchlist"" the preferred ones and get news in case it got selected by someone elseInfo becomes inaccessible after flat selection is made",btohqsg
So the procedure ishFE letter - wait for BTo launch - apply online - wait for allocation number if number is good then book a flat that's period I can view the flat block and units no?After booking of flat unit after 9 month go sign agreement lease then pay down payment 10% then it's a long wait for BTo to build then before collection of key 6 months before sell existing flats and pay back cpf for loan and the other sale $$ will take back and use to pay for the finals amount for the new BtOIs this steps correct?',btohqsg
Hi  asking for a friend. He has a Q number for precious nov 2022 bto and the appointment for flat selection is on coming Monday. However he did ballot for the latest may 2023 bto as well. I think the Result suppose to be out on July but delay till Aug according to him. So the question is let's say he secure the unit on Monday. Will hdb still release the result to him for the may 2023 balloting? As in got q number or not will he be inform? Or since he had alr secured a unit. will automatically forfeit his pending result for balloting  may 2023 bto launch.,btohqsg
No. They will cancel all other application once he book a unit.,btohqsg
once he selected a unit  his other flat applications will be cancelled,btohqsg
Alright thanks for the quick answer but Can he appeal ? For his case is becoz his number is quite far behind. So he did his calculations knowing that the flat selection will only apply to him from Aug onwards. That's y he try another ballot from may 2023 knowing that the result will be out by Aug hoping to get a better q number.. however now result is delay resulting his appointment day to fall before the results is out..,btohqsg
Which means he will nv know if he get or not get for the may 2023 ballot ?hdb will consider that application not counted ?,btohqsg
what he can do is let others choose first before him  if he want to gamble the risk,btohqsg
Suppose to be July. Which means he will get to know the results before his flat selection,btohqsg
so imagine if there is 100-200+ remaining units when its his turn  but he choose to let ppl go ahead while he wait for number and lets say he choose to go back nov 2022 project if he dont like his may bto number  he may be left with even lesser available units to choose from,btohqsg
His number is very behind le. Alr not much to choose from.,btohqsg
now alr announced results will be released in 1st week of August so no matter what  your friend has to make a choice,btohqsg
whether to forfeit his Nov 2022 and gamble to see if he get a good number for May 2023 bto,btohqsg
But if he nv turn up for flat selection for Monday it will be forfeit too right ?,btohqsg
his Nov 2022 number confirm is within supply right  just q behind considering the selections ongoing now is still within flat supply de,btohqsg
Or need to inform hdb tell them he will wait till may 2023 result out then go for flat.selection,btohqsg
until selections end then his Nov 2022 will forfeit or he can send efeedback form to cancel his Nov 2022 application,btohqsg
dont need  he can wait it out if he wants,btohqsg
Which means the q number will move forward then his will be push backwards ? Then when he ready to wan go flat selection how ? The appointment date and time is over.just.walk in ?,btohqsg
yeah just walk in anytime during hdb office hours  others will go first if he choose to wait,btohqsg
Am I correct on this procedure?,btohqsg
No la.. Automatically cancel the one he/she applied. U think can play the system ar,btohqsg
Once booked and selected the flat all other applications is cancelled.,btohqsg
the procedure also stated on hdb website,btohqsg
CPF contributions will be good enough. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing for tomorrow,btohqsg
Ya so what's I wrote correct? Just want to double check,btohqsg
They will just use ur cpf,btohqsg
That's what they did for us today,btohqsg
So no worries if no payslip,btohqsg
For young folk ok LoR 10ye is nothing for old man 10ye is near to retirement,btohqsg
We brought along our CPF contributions. However they still require your payslip. The invitation package will state from which month and year to which month and year. For example  ‚ÄúDecember 2022 to February 2023‚Äù. So if she just quit her job  it‚Äôs not necessary for her to retrieve July‚Äôs payslip. Read through the invitation package and they will show applicant 1 and applicant 2 what are the payslips that needed to be printed to bring along. We didn‚Äôt print that‚Äôs why we have to retrieve and submit and through the MyDoc.,btohqsg
Hi  is there any way I can reapply for my HFE? As I realised there are some parts I need to change,btohqsg
