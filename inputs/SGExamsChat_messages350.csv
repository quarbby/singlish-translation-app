Then all we can do is pray I guess,btohqsg
Should offer metrics to grade em by,btohqsg
But one thing for sure is to remain professional. Be careful in the things you do  don't AWOL  don't sit one side do nothing,btohqsg
Like number of projects done? Number of meetings attended,btohqsg
Tough coz not every 2 jobs are the same,btohqsg
Metrics usually are more general  like whether the person can do independently or need help,btohqsg
U mind sharing your internship experience with me?,btohqsg
I wanna learn more about it,btohqsg
I went for 2 internships coz polee and uni  polee one very short only since I was from old batch. Both not counted for GPA but they will indicate a letter grade.,btohqsg
For polee I was in an SME  my team all quite nice and their culture is you can do whatever you want as long as you finish the tasks that team lead issue to you. That includes sleeping and watching drama in lab lol  just be careful if got boss walk in.,btohqsg
For uni  my issue was my dept work is mostly high level  so there's not much intern-level things I could do. Mostly 2h per day I finish all my tasks already. I did ask for work but all too high level. I was not too inclined on asking other teams or dept coz I ever worked in temp job in another company where the mentor don't like her staff helping others. But in the end I got kena gl by other manager for zuobo.,btohqsg
I am interning right now at a small company,btohqsg
So I got explicit permission to go help admin and lab side  which I pretty much did all the way until my internship ended.,btohqsg
It's like when there's alot of high level stuff u can't do much if ur an intern,btohqsg
Ya exactly. Such cases you will have to cross-teams and learn other stuff.,btohqsg
Currently the company I'm working at have a batch of interns  just recently got one of them kena say for zuobo also LOL but I think she's just suay  coz her lab also like recently not much to do apparently.,btohqsg
Bobian but boss ask her go help other teams lor,btohqsg
I recently injured my knee pretty badly. My company is fortunate enuff to let me work from home haha,btohqsg
If can wfh a bit dumb if not feeling well still drag ownself to wokr,btohqsg
Hmm previous batch of intern  my lab's intern failed her internship coz it was found out that she apparently AWOL and faked her timesheet details.,btohqsg
Even at work I see everyone talk to each other through Microsoft teams,btohqsg
Same coz lazy walk here and there,btohqsg
Pure phy practical 20221st qn was on density of springMass is given 5.1gHold the spring and calculate length l andThen some other parts  formula is given and we just sub in the valuesLast part of qn 1 is describe source of error during the experimental procedure and explain how it affects the value of density of spring2nd qn was movement of a blutack with a string attached to it into a measuring cylinder filled with oil( qn instructs to pull the string such that the blu tack is just touching the oil surface and then b4 releasing it  start stopwatch and stop stopwatch once it reaches bottom) that is T+ planning qn eqn givenT= (D/r^2)(k). Student claims that eqn is...r is radius of the bluetack(one part of the qn said to find radius->1m)3rd qn is like a potentiometer/jockey qn except the long 1m wire is a resistance wire1st part was to find the V and I when L=1002nd part find its R  ohm and P  wattR=resistance  P is powerNext  When plotting table  it states need to include R  P V  I  LFor diff values of L.Next part of qn3 was asked to plot P against LThen Draw a curved best Fit LineThen draw tangent at L=60.0cm and find its gradientAfterwards was asked to describe the trend of the graph(3m)Then sources of errors when calculating G (3m)Edit: mostly should be correct  it's based on what i rmb jn so i might still miss out some litte parts xD,btohqsg
what’s the density of the spring,btohqsg
other friends got values ranging from 157 to 200+,btohqsg
How? Lol its m/v tho 5.1/v,btohqsg
Its not like they ask for kg/m^3,btohqsg
I think mine is ard the same as yours,btohqsg
I dont rmb getting such a big value,btohqsg
so they saying its density is 157000-200000+kg/m^3,btohqsg
Mi.. looking forward for ..chem n bio,btohqsg
I wan see what my students say,btohqsg
time to invent a new element,btohqsg
Does anyone know of a telegram group that mainly focuses on meeting new people and what not,btohqsg
every year's bio is so sad,btohqsg
ur probably a professional at it,btohqsg
Sometimes the essay qns r <3,btohqsg
I am studying from my chemistry pratical right noeBut then I feel I like procrastinating the whole day,btohqsg
Humans were not meant to be in a rigid environment of studying,btohqsg
But I guess over time we forced ourselves to.,btohqsg
So dun feel that bad about procrastinating.,btohqsg
For anyone feeling stress for exam or whatnot. Here:https://youtu.be/4KGKXrojQFI,btohqsg

All J1 h2 econs students doing syllabus 9570?,btohqsg
I kinda want more time also 😬😬,btohqsg
One of the benefits of voluntarily retaining for me lol,btohqsg
Ohh I MI year 2 doing 9757,btohqsg
I still think 50 mins per essay isn’t enough,btohqsg
Oh if basically it’s just 2023 paper onwards than new syllabus so makes sense,btohqsg
Each year has their own grade boundaries,btohqsg
I’m thinking that there will be separate bellcurves for 9757 and 9570,btohqsg
I’m not sure if I’m doing 9570 next year,btohqsg
I’m not sure if they’re pre determined before a paper or after they’ve marked and can tell the students performance since there’s many conflicting sources but they do use grade boundaries that are adjustable each year for each subject,btohqsg
Basically grade threshold for each year and subject is different regardless if there’s a syllabus change,btohqsg
So it could be 68% A for econs this year and 71% for 2023 H2 econs etc,btohqsg
New syllabus also added new stuff like cognitive bias and a slight change in the way of marking if I’m not wrong and removed some stuff like 1st and 2nd degree price discrimination,btohqsg
Ohh cool  I just started learning about cost of production,btohqsg
So you at market structure now?,btohqsg
Is it MI start macro first,btohqsg
Like Hc ny vj they all do some macro before doing market structure,btohqsg
Then complete rest of macro later,btohqsg
Yup  SCOC -> Dd Ss/Elasticities -> Govt Intervention/Market Failure -> SOL etc  macroeconomic goals -> policies,btohqsg
How did they change the marking?,btohqsg
my econs Cher say pu3 syllabus diff from pu1,btohqsg
I think my teacher said something like evaluation now includes pros and cons? And I think previously that wasn’t the case,btohqsg
but cos i gave up alr,btohqsg
wait hows ur promos so late,btohqsg
eh but math is a diff thing tho,btohqsg
Any teachers here could you pm me. I'm interested in the teaching industry. Hope you could share your life experience,btohqsg
wow Bedok scored higher than me in my J1 promos. I only scored 97 😭,btohqsg
Max i got for jc maths b4 a lvl is 38 :),btohqsg
38 out of how many again ah,btohqsg
long time never touch math alr,btohqsg
Now im not doing math anymore,btohqsg
I thought u a lvl kid,btohqsg
dunno but it was true for me for F Maths.,btohqsg
U dont see ppl scoring 90+ in jc,btohqsg
that's because you didn't see me in jc 😂,btohqsg
i don't see then score 90+ buti got see some got 90+ wrong,btohqsg
I kind of regret I didn't store the papers to laminate,btohqsg
Maybe my circle not smart enough,btohqsg
no lah look at ans key confirm can get 90+ one,btohqsg
My A level was 21 years ago  different,btohqsg
I can get 100 if i look at ans key,btohqsg
I hv alot of fm frens leh,btohqsg
U say fm i think of financial management,btohqsg

A for everything else  including 2 S papers,btohqsg
i heard uni not alot of places to go if gp <b tho,btohqsg
J need b shameless and rip ppl off,btohqsg
I think might be a marker diff,btohqsg

Teachers tht agree will give u higher marks,btohqsg
Jc alot gp chers are sjw,btohqsg
Like if u think abt it,btohqsg
Ur Cambridge markers all gnna be old white conservative men,btohqsg
U need to balance being interesting and being too radical,btohqsg
Like u cant sound smarter than them,btohqsg
But u need to sound like u are on the 2nd lvl while they are on the 5th,btohqsg

no my sec sch math was actually harder than alvls,btohqsg
no my sec sch math was neither olvls nor ip,btohqsg
but 90+ not that rare leh i feel,btohqsg
u go around confirm can find,btohqsg
my class had q a lot 💀💀💀,btohqsg

Random qn...when someone tell u they go for rehabilitation what would you think about them as a first impression?,btohqsg
But Ty for the honest ans,btohqsg
Cause i going to get greatest improvement  69% to 99%,btohqsg
rather than bothering and crying over a problem they have  like how many peeps will  they are trying to change,btohqsg
no need lah stay at 69% can alr :D,btohqsg
isit not the most common ?,btohqsg
I kena 69% curse too many times ...,btohqsg
bruh i nvr ans qns againthey're a change maker :D,btohqsg
then whats the most common reason for rehabilitation,btohqsg
if its not smt gang related,btohqsg
no cld also be mental problems,btohqsg
They needed someone to advice them?,btohqsg
or mostly students/adults/others face stress during life,btohqsg
i don't mean like severe one la,btohqsg
rehab normally not associated with mental therapy?,btohqsg
idk man maybe im one of those dumb peeps that mix/join them up,btohqsg
wait so u saw my channel? 👀,btohqsg
"""the action of restoring someone to health or normal life through training and therapy after imprisonment  addiction  or illness.""",btohqsg
HOW DID 20 PEOPLE ALREADY VIEW MY CHANNEL,btohqsg
okay i suppose illness is also a meaning,btohqsg
but yah normally its the first 2,btohqsg
if its for health reasons can specify right,btohqsg
physical is like physio or smt,btohqsg
All my mental problems fade away after seeing this,btohqsg
where u take this from ah,btohqsg
Soooo impression : gangster I'm assuming,btohqsg
like physio is counted as rehab too ?,btohqsg
I was just describing pb sandwich and toast,btohqsg
I feel my back is bent,btohqsg
I want someone to crack my back,btohqsg
yah but normally when u said rehab u arent referring to like health rehab tho,btohqsg
^^ I assume is like addiction or smth,btohqsg
bruh who the h can spell that :(,btohqsg
I got 99 in math you know,btohqsg

TrishCalm down and study for the next one,btohqsg
ayo why i still cant use my other channel,btohqsg
anyone got ans for n level chemistry,btohqsg
Any tips for memorising Social studies,btohqsg
maybe u can read out loud  and try to phrase it into your own words,btohqsg
Ya teach to your plushies or smth,btohqsg
Isn’t there only like 8 marks out of 50 unless if the syllabus has changed. Cos I thought it’s 35 marks sbq and 15 seq. And of the 15 marks essay the 7 marks one doesn’t need memo and only the 8 marks one need,btohqsg
Think about constraints and benefits. Even for the 8 mark memo question even if you didn’t memorise you could use common sense and still get 2-3 marks. So if you need to spend many hours to memorise 10 chaps of content just to get that 6 marks more I think it’s certainly more worth it spending time on your elect geog/hist to memorise content since there are more marks for questions that requires memory  unless if you’ve been consistently mugging and think you can afford to spend time on SS. I barely memorised anything for SS since I spent most of my revision on elect geog and could still get A1. imo it’s better to do sbq practices for SS to make sure you get the structure right and have a sense on whether you’re making the right inferences so you can score well for that,btohqsg
And coming from someone who have abit of work experience. Marks doesn't do anything to help you better yourself in the work place. Only thing it gets you is opportunity. Doing well and being successful boils down to your personality.,btohqsg
Cause I dun want to see people because of low marks or something they do something stupid,btohqsg
It comes from your interpretation at the end of the day,btohqsg
It boils down to who has more knowledge on the world. Example: I dun stay in touch with the small news that happens daily but I like reading on inflation  current trends and such,btohqsg
If u happen to not have any knowledge then best you can do is to try to smoke,btohqsg
Like what u said about SS,btohqsg
And if let's say at the end of the day or life u dun accomplish anything great and worthy of mention then so be it. Least u were brave enuff to continue down your journey.Life should not be taken super seriously because it will backfire on your mental health.,btohqsg
Coming from a guy that likes philosophy,btohqsg
At this point if u dun know then not much u can do,btohqsg
Best you can do is ask for last minute advice?,btohqsg
honestly if u can do well in ur SBQ,btohqsg
ur sbq is quite saved alr,btohqsg
Only tip for SS last minute is that during the exam u write notes beside the question and jot down all sorts of possible interpretations u can have and then pick the best.,btohqsg
I would say tackle the paper with common sense but I realised what I think make sense may not to the marker,btohqsg
Should have but not everyone would,btohqsg
Sec sch with covid is disturbing,btohqsg
Stating a personal experience so I can assure others that it works. I got C6 for chinese and failed H1 CL. Are you happy that I said that now?,btohqsg
Bottom line is  it’s more important to be pragmatic and work smart especially if there are constraints like time because you want to maximise your marks. Maybe my method of studying won’t work but the message is the same  focus on areas which would likely benefit you more for each unit of time you study as it really helped for me. For my case spending the same amount of time memorising elect geog as compared to SS would help improve my combined humans results more more since imo geog requires more memorisation,btohqsg
Some stuff required practice like math and chem,btohqsg
Some need understanding or memorisation like bio,btohqsg
Yes like math u won’t memorise and blindly memorising Chem won’t get u much,btohqsg
Some need you to learn a skill,btohqsg
Once you know how to argue and get L3 you got it,btohqsg
Yeah not forgetting to mention there’s 16 marks of essays for geog. SS sbq doesn’t need memo besides the format which is pretty easy,btohqsg
And the 4 marks part in section B no resource as well,btohqsg
But regardless I think this applies for all subjects. study smart so you can maximise your marks in exams,btohqsg
I am at the last stretch and procrastinating alot,btohqsg
get out of telegram you don't make a difference here so you are completely useless here,btohqsg
If you not gonna study  others will  they'll do btr than u and u'll be lost u want that ah,btohqsg
Also I shld @ myself tbh.,btohqsg
U see if u dun study ur useless. U need to study otherwise next time you'll be working for me and I'll be mean to h,btohqsg
u want more choices in courses in JAE?,btohqsg
U gotta have good results man,btohqsg
if u @ urself everyone will follow suit meaning that ur arguement is invalid,btohqsg
mans went straight for the kill,btohqsg
U happy with ur prelims result meh,btohqsg
Not happy then must study to improve right,btohqsg
Don't be a lazy fucker on your chair staring at your phone. Ur parents out there fucking working for u to rant on telegram,btohqsg
cmon bro i don't even know you well  stop being a dick to everyone here and get the f outta here no one cares about you here so just leave,btohqsg
Don't be all talk no action,btohqsg
