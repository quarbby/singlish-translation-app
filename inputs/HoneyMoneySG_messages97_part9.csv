as today is the last business day before 30 and the giro will not be done on non-business day  can i just assume it wouldn’t come..?,btohqsg
Last business day is 30  so still have chance. But I think because your GIRO set-up after your statement  may be better off manually pay,btohqsg
GIRO setup was after the statement. I think you are not getting the idea how it works in the first place,btohqsg
so long your statement (at the point of generation) does not indicate that payment is under GIRO arrangement  you need to do it manually. it'll be in giro arrangement in the next statement instead,btohqsg
1. His statement doesn’t state that it will be deducted via GIRO.2. No chance as Citi deducted yesterday for due date 30th Mar,btohqsg
okay got it thanks guys  never expected such detailed responses.appreciate it and have a great day and weekends ahead!,btohqsg

noted  so eg. for amundi index msci global fund  do you know what is the frequency that the fund manager will do this? like example i put 10k inside  for the first month i gained 2% which is 200. so after that the total will be 10.2k  which becomes the new base capital?,btohqsg
read the relevant TnC for the specific account u referring to,btohqsg
hi! any HYSA recommendations with no minimum spend?,btohqsg
Maribank 2.88%Singlife 3%Sc esaver 3.6% (depending on promo)Has acc 2.38-2.68%,btohqsg
If you’re open to money market funds  can get 3.7%+ (stashaway simple  syfe cash  endowus cash smart  etc),btohqsg
Sgd Fullerton on moo moo also mmf right?,btohqsg
On moomoo you are buying/selling mmf directly  but on some of the other platforms you don’t interact with the mmf directly so the experience feels closer to a bank acct. Even though at the end of the day they might all buy the same sgd fullerton fund,btohqsg
Is not on the website on bank accts. The basic savings account is too old skool to be advertised on the main page for savings accounts. Reflective under Fees and charges,btohqsg
Hi guys! For UOB EVOL card if I were to spend 600$ for the mth just in the contactless category and non in the online categoryI would have only 20$ worth of cash back?,btohqsg
i heard DPs not working as of this morning.Anyone with SUCCESSFUL experience? The miles back should be INSTANT.,btohqsg
Frequency is not much of a concern because it’s the fund manager’s job to do it. Any dividends receivable by the fund basically accounts into the net asset value.,btohqsg
hi all  just wondering for interests from money market funds like fullerton sgd cash funds on moomoo/webull  do we need to declare in our income tax filing for such interests?,btohqsg
Did mine at 10+am but didn’t get milesback as well.,btohqsg
They took down the banner on Kris+ app but promo is still published on fairprice websitehttps://www.fairprice.com.sg/events/finest/exclusive-promotion-with-kris/,btohqsg
It’s still in Kris+ under ‘Highlights’,btohqsg
Oh it's back  for a moment  it was gone,btohqsg
Same. 4x $200 + 1x $80. Nice of them to break it up.,btohqsg
Hello  is the standard chartered bonus saver salary crediting have to use real salary for crediting? Any walkaround?,btohqsg

Update: my milesback just came in. Did another redemption and milesback is instant.@oscar73freire,btohqsg
Dear friends  I'm new to this community pls pardon my question if too noob: I've UOB one card  what is the best and cheapest way to clock $500/mth debit/credit spending to earn high interest overseas  as I will be travelling to Malaysia and China next few months 🙏,btohqsg
Don’t think UOB one is a good choice for overseas spend,btohqsg
If its for uob one account interests  you can bill your insurance to uob one debit card.,btohqsg
Yes but my insurance is low amount and there's spare to spend. In sg I usually hit 500/mth with retail and dining spending. Wonder if there's any strategy when I'm overseas,btohqsg
Pass me the credit card. I help u spend 😂Jokes aside. I believe u can still do online platform spend there? Like buy things from taobao and get them delivered to ur malaysia and china address. Suppose u would need to spend alot on living supplies.Or u could also buy evouchers online. Eg.Fairprice. So you can delay spending them  and when u return to sg then spend them before expiry,btohqsg
Tx Mel.😂 On a side note  is the UOB quarterly bonus likely to happen again? I heard that today is the last day to transfer out all your funds,btohqsg
Hi  have anyone encountered a situation in Tiger Brokers where they credit the cash dividend to you by mistake even though u selected stock dividend?,btohqsg
500 means 500  how to be cheaper,btohqsg
It will probably in mid April they announce if there is such a promotion,btohqsg
Let see. Anyway I participated in the Jan so I can’t do for this round.,btohqsg
Uob one rebate is 3.33 if u fulfill criteria  foreign charge is 3.25 percent so if u overshot or underspend it is not worth it,btohqsg

Has anyone used revolut in Malaysia? There’s no option to convert sgd to myr right? But it will auto convert when I pay using my card on the spot is it?,btohqsg
Tx queenie  just to clarify: 3.33% rebate is quarterly so effectively 1.11% cashback per month. Foreign charge 3.25% means if I spent 500sgd equivalent in 1 month  UOB will charge me 16.25sgd correct? On top of that I have to be subjected to their bad exchange rate right?,btohqsg
Subject to bad rate  quarterly mean per month need to fulfill the criteria then get back overall 3.33 per month u fulfill 500 block spend for 3 month,btohqsg
$50 quarterly rebate for $500 each month  effective 3.33% not 1.11%  subjected to standard visa exchange rate,btohqsg
Hi. Has anyone used Amaze in China recently?,btohqsg
anyone received the save up level up cashback for those who signed up In December 2023?,btohqsg
Sorry  very confused. If we withdraw and empty out uob one 100k out today  we lose just a few days interest or the whole month interest if we did not hit the MAB of 100k?,btohqsg
Ur MAB will drop (lets say to 95k) then the interest will be calculated based on that. its not a all in or noth,btohqsg
Tks Cheng. So if MAB not 100k  will not get the 5% even if fulfill rest of the criteria right?,btohqsg
will get 4.xx% for 9x k,btohqsg
not effective 5%. its the tiered system so effective 4.xx,btohqsg
