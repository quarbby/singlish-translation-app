Yesterday  22 December 2023  was a test for me 1st incident:1st order of the day  accepted order and as usual  I‚Äôll call customer to confirm the item and determined the size of the item as my thermal bag is small(22L).Based on LLM guideline of 40cm x 25cm x 25cm  slightly larger still ok as long I can manage.Immediately proceeded to PU point after confirmation with customer.Upon reaching outside customer‚Äôs house  saw fellow rider carrying white carrier bag  I checked at the shoe rack and didn‚Äôt see the white carrier bag as mentioned by customer earlier on  immediately I called the other rider to check with him  he was from Grab. We checked and confirmed it‚Äôs the same item. Not his fault though. Confirmed it‚Äôs a double booking.ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èCalled customer but didn‚Äôt answer and suddenly job was missing(hmmmm)..I calm myself and texted LLM hoping for a compensation  but communicating with their ‚Äúhuman‚Äù is so draggy that I opt to ignore and move on with other job order.But definitely after ‚Äúeducating‚Äù the customer via WhatsApp voice note.2nd incident:Tried calling customer 3 times for confirmation but no answer. Texted her via LLM apps  but still no reply.While waiting  I was liaising with another customer.The latter called and with a high tone  asking me what time will I reach her place  as she noticed I was stationary.I told her of LLM procedure of confirmation with customer.Obviously she‚Äôs not taking it  and said that she definitely know her item is ok  that‚Äôs why she book LLMüôÑ. Reminded her again on LLM procedure upon accepting a job.This time she said that she doing LLM also and knows the procedure. Told her that ‚Äògood‚Ä¶.the more she should know the procedure‚Äô.As not to lengthen the argument  I told her that I‚Äôll just cancel the order.Requested LLM to cancel this job but took them about 2 jobs to remove the cancelled job from ‚Äòongoing‚Äô.Sorry for the lengthy post.I‚Äôll use this to copy paste to ‚Äúshare‚Äù with LLM.üò¨Have a great weekend everyone!!,btohqsg
Actually like that case don take the job so far not worth,btohqsg

"I didn't take..it was a lalamove desperate attempt cause no one took. So they just call drivers randomly in attempt to ""assign to u"".I in Changi  how to reach pickup at Jurong in 15mins?LLM seems like randomly calling  hope some poor fella accept it  then push the blame to the fella that he is late for pickup.",btohqsg
Anyone have any idea why it‚Äôs $40 and Lalamove added $16?,btohqsg
Cause this period sometimes their order stuck and no driver pick up so they put that amount fixed at $40 to make driver see the order and swipe,btohqsg
If not their orders stuck they also need add tips become the same,btohqsg
Only this period only the price good later after finish chrismas go normal back already,btohqsg
