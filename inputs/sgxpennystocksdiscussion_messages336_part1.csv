Sorry boss I just share my opinion maybe I am wrong,btohqsg
We promote so must be careful?,btohqsg
No lah!Only Furion approved then ok lah,btohqsg
Honestly I speak from my heart after reading the report lol,btohqsg
Honestly you ask meThe safest penny to park is ...zero debts lol,btohqsg
No worries bro..I find what u said is not offensive la,btohqsg
Because I don‚Äôt like high debts company,btohqsg
Ok...just asking why u say we promote must careful haha,btohqsg
I find many good penny companies with zero debts and very good,btohqsg
Honestly read Del balance sheet  I don‚Äôt want to invest ...,btohqsg
I only share with James lol,btohqsg
Hi Desmond I feel you are definitely entitled to your opinion with regards to del monte. Not aiming to change it or AnythingAgree to disagree,btohqsg
Honestly HPH zero debtsOnly one tip today lol,btohqsg
However you chose to be in here for whatever reason only known to yourself.You are welcomed all the same. You are being removed on suspicion of clone but some seasoned member here vouched for James the silver man who added u. So I unbanned and request he send the links to both of u and extended my apology.So it is disappointing to say the least on the demeaning manner u chose to describe us despite not having done anything to u. I understand you are an active member at the other group and u choose to stay silent here  your choice no issue.However the lack of basic respect is appalling,btohqsg
Then clearly u don‚Äôt know them well enough,btohqsg
Bro Furion nice to meet youI heard about you  after I monitoring you said I think you are good man,btohqsg
There are plenty of common members in both  never exclusive. So I hope it‚Äôs not an intended remark. There is and will never be any intended competition between both groups  regardless if it is one sided on our end or not,btohqsg
I advocate respect for either. I remove any attacks on each other within here. I hope the same for all here too,btohqsg
Thanks. Hope we can learn more mutually too,btohqsg
Yes can‚Äôt blame must always DYODD,btohqsg
Because of debt. Anything worth pointing out,btohqsg
Never made any attempts to conceal the debt figure. A mistake from the past  share price punished more than 80% at one point perhaps.Instead of in search of the perfect companyI prefer the value for money one. Balance my risk reward. Works for me but not for everyone,btohqsg
Actually I wanted to be quiet in this group I only want learn but my opinion on Del showed up lolMaybe I am wrong always DYODD thanks,btohqsg
Feel free to disagree and discuss any topics. As long as is on topic doesn‚Äôt get personal everything goes,btohqsg

Eventually it will be anything but sweet to shareholders.,btohqsg
My post on 2 March after their updates.,btohqsg
Not much. But just to time stamp,btohqsg
At current price can try ...,btohqsg
The latest placement is a perfect reason to fryBut also perfect excuse to get the hell out,btohqsg

As u mentioned bulk of your investment in reitsSo likely taken for granted management is sound. Esp likes of maple tree frasers etc,btohqsg
China star foodIt‚Äôs anything but sound,btohqsg
And nope u don‚Äôt see it in the accountsWith some forensics perhaps u do.Just my 1 centMaybe same as their share price soon,btohqsg
Actually I don‚Äôt know who put me here.Certainly many condemned youBut I think you are not too bad lol,btohqsg
