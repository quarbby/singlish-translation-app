It is ballot so it does not matter you submit earlier or later right ? They will only start after the closing date may be end of the month ?,btohqsg
may i ask those that apply for hdb loan then refinance to bank loan  the first downpayment will be 5%? then when closer to second downpayment apply for bank loan and pay 20%?,btohqsg
Yeah. But curious what time it opens so can gauge what time it closes,btohqsg
Oh? Itâ€™s not for 1 week?,btohqsg
Canâ€™t wait for June launch to come,btohqsg
Itâ€™s been quite a long wait,btohqsg
HDB commercial shop space: tengah - minimart and/or clinic.,btohqsg
Maybe June BTO in line with the opening of TEL extension. Seems only fitting so homebuyers can potentially gauge their interest,btohqsg
That's 23 June right? ðŸ˜‚ What a wild thought ðŸ˜‚ I was hoping for the release to be this week,btohqsg
Same. Haha. In any case  Iâ€™m all ready. All the best. Hopefully it does come out this week,btohqsg
