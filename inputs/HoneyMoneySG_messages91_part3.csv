Hi gurus  is a recurring bill to singtel eligible for 4mpd on DBs wmcc?,btohqsg
Can someone enlighten me what is this?,btohqsg
Just use excel to calculate the average yourself. If you’re at 100k for 30 days and then the last day is 0  the average for the whole month won’t be 100k. Basic math,btohqsg
Isn’t it stated in the email,btohqsg
Based on your posting  you maintain $100k from 01-29 Dec and withdraw it on 30 Dec. Hence  it is not throughout.It means you only maintain $100k on 29 days out of 31 days in December.ADB = (29 days x $100k)/31days.,btohqsg
Hi I need some advice from veterans here. I have a fraud transaction back in 2021  till now still unresolved. The amt is 6.5k. Uob offered 50% goodwill offer  or let me choose to go fidrec for mediation. (if I go mediation  50% offer will be invalid) So I went for mediation. after mediation  the conclusion was no one is allegedly guilty  back in 2021.To cut story short  back to 2023  the amt 6.5k still exist in my cc bill  but late charge was waived from then till Oct 2023  where uob started charging interest of around 180+- per month. Called in cso many times  went their different oub branch 3 times  in January  and now still waiting their reply. But interest charged keep piling up  now reach abt $880.Any experts can pls advise on what to do next?I have been their long time account holder  >10 to 15yrs and even taking home loan with them.I went to uob Plaza  hoping to meet higher management  but the cso who served me only helped to call the hotline  and informed no need to meet.Appreciate if u have any advice pls.,btohqsg
Maybe write in to mas to seek help,btohqsg
can you give more background on the Fraud transaction.MerchantOnline/OfflineAny OTP involved,btohqsg
My cc was charged by someone's bigpay account  for ecommerce in Malaysia. I didn't even know what was bigpay then and didn't own any bigpay account.Police final verdict is that it was out of their jurisdiction since it was overseas transaction.There were more than 10 transactions involving otp  but I did not receive any single otp at all. But m1 told me their system showed otps were sent to me. Likewise uob also said their system showed otp send to me. But I had none of them,btohqsg
ok are you using Android phone and did you install any 3rd party apps in your phone?I am not trying to grill you.I am just trying to guide you on why UOB seems to be washing their hands off you,btohqsg
because long story short  if there are OTPs involved  and it is proven that OTPs were indeed sent out  Banks have a stronger position to deny a fraud transaction waiver.,btohqsg
I remembered I was exercising in a park on the night the fraud happened. I only found out when I logged in the next morning.,btohqsg
yeah was your phone compromised due to your own actions?e.g. you installed some 3rd party software,btohqsg
As far as I remember  I only install app fr playstore.,btohqsg
because your situation has been 'reported in newspaper' before.If OTPs are involved  but the scammers are able to get the genuine OTP from the victims phone (due to 3rd party software  screensharing  ownself give up details to scammer)  then banks will be less/not liable.,btohqsg
There was 1.5k involved in transferwise  but managed to be reversed,btohqsg
Otherwise it wd be 8k fraud,btohqsg
Did you make a police report? So they can get telco involved on what happened to the SMS OTP?e.g. was the SMS diverted etc..,btohqsg
All was done in 2021. M1 said it was sent to my hp. But I did not receive any,btohqsg
So I went for mediation. after mediation  the conclusion was no one is allegedly guilty  back in 2021.What does this mean... did FIDREC assess you to be 50% liable?,btohqsg
there should have been a conclusion after the mediation.. who responsible for how much,btohqsg
and if FIDREC passed a judgement/recommendation  UOB would surely have followed it,btohqsg
Hi  both dbs altitude and dbs wwmc rejected my annual fee waiver despite heavy usage on them. if i cancel both cards  are there any penalties? what about the dbs ppints that i accumulated that shows in dbs paylah rewards?,btohqsg
"""But m1 told me their system showed otps were sent to me. Likewise uob also said their system showed otp send to me.""unfortunately this is the damning evidence..i think with these 2 pieces of info (M1 is objective  no reason to lie)  UOB offer you 50% discount is actually not bad already.It is probably caused by your phone being compromised  based on the limited information that you had provided.",btohqsg
On a side note  this is a good lesson for people not to install any apps outside of official app stores.  If you suspect your phone is compromised  reset the phone.,btohqsg
yeah i believe Phil Lee is definitely not a willing party to the scambut it is very likely a case he didn't know his phone was compromised.and if UOB got the evidence from M1 (independent party) that OTPs were indeed sent to Users mobile phone  then UOB actually can demand user to be 100% responsible for the charges.,btohqsg
Points will be forfeited if card cancelled before redemption. Call in and request (a few times via human assistance) before finally giving up.,btohqsg
i would suggest 28th march 2024,btohqsg
The Body Shop's Singapore stores will remain open despite its British business entering administration  said a company spokeswoman.https://str.sg/ukef,btohqsg
Sat is working day right for 30 mar,btohqsg
i won't risk it since you cannot predict which day UOB sets as the reference date..and no downside to do early  as long as you move in more funds on 1st march  you can also take out the funds earlier.,btohqsg
Withdraw on 30th should be standard based on past campaign. U have joined quite alot liao right  have u seen reference date before 30?,btohqsg
then later.. sway sway 30th march.. your other bank got maintenance.. u GGi always like to do at least 1-2 days earlier than the expected day..don't like JUST IN TIME,btohqsg
Hello  I'm new here. I would like to know that I now have an ocbc360 account. Is there any bank account with high fixed deposit interest recommended for another 100k?,btohqsg
i have heard of people see 30th as cutoff date  they go and do 30th 10.30pm and miss it...so...,btohqsg
I do at 30th midnight right after 29 usually. Anyway if move out 29 jan should also show as 30 since it is a public holiday,btohqsg
one thing i always am cautious about  is the bermuda triangle timing..i won't do banking stuff from 11pm to 6am... that is usually when banks do system maintenance / batch run.. and weird things can happen.,btohqsg
1). Do you have a lot of miles in these two cards?2). Did you use the 2 lounge passes?3). Heavy usage means how many digits of expenses/transactions in a year?4). Did you settled all the bills before due date?,btohqsg
and as said... if do on 28th march  no downside..yes maybe you need $115k for 27 days instead of $110k for 29 days...but your $115k can be taken out earlier and put into your other high interest earning account.. so it evens out..but u have big peace of mind 100% confirm qualify,btohqsg
Lol problem is what if dont have extra 15k coz i am counting i might not have that 15k if 27 day. Coz my money in and out for giro bill alot each month,btohqsg
then i guess no choice you won't get full 5% p.a. on $100k ADB for the month loh..for the user to weigh peace of mind more important or the full 5% p.a. on $100kno right no wrong,btohqsg
On a positive news  based on today's transactions  I have just noticed UOB Credit Cards seem to have switched to TMRW App authentication for online purchases. No more OTP authentication.What have you guys experienced?,btohqsg
Don't have to increase  can just maintain,btohqsg
Then try $106 897.00 in Mar n withdraw on 30 Mar  10am.,btohqsg
I have fraud transaction for citibank reward even though need to authorise through the app have call in to inform and dispute the charge,btohqsg
I had fraud on my Citi Premiermiles even though it was locked,btohqsg
this one confirm can reverse.. if Citi refuses  confirm can get FIDREC positive judgement in your favour!! lol,btohqsg
Fraud reversed  CCY conversion fee not ($0.07),btohqsg
there are merchants who do not turn on OTP verification.. so for those  the transaction will go through  but almost 100% banks will reverse for you if you call in to disputee.g. those USD10 ChatGPT nonsense,btohqsg
How does that work? If it’s locked the transaction will not be posted successfully I thought?,btohqsg
