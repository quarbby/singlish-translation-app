based on recommendations is fine  but understand where you are coming from thanks,btohqsg
It's non-local thats why  does anyone happen to know any local housing rental companies in sg? Maybe I can use that as reference is fine.,btohqsg
Maybe you can use amaze + empty wallet to check the MCC? Since it's non local  you might want to use amaze to avoid the 3.25% fx charge by banks anyway.,btohqsg
can also use heymax to search for mcc of overseas merchant  just need to choose the country when doing the search,btohqsg
Can I check if I want to maximise ONE UOB return  I have to spend min sgd 500 for credit card and credit the salary monthly  can I check whether there is a way for me to credit my salary in myself?,btohqsg

anyone received the interest for Dec to Jan HSBC cycle (don't need sms to apply)?,btohqsg
The t and c says there is fall behind $2 after opening 6 months,btohqsg

there will always be People who procastinated till the 11th hour..haha,btohqsg
If you and your family members travel very frequently  best card I can think of is HSBC Visa Infinite card. That's because BOTH principal cardmember and sub card holders have unlimited lounge access under Lounge Key program. But this card doesn't allow AF waiver I think. So you need to travel frequently to make it worth the value,btohqsg
You can find out which lounge or restaurants participating under this Lounge Key program. Sometimes I will even purposely go to another terminal after landed in Singapore to eat at a restaurant that I know is nice using free lounge pass.,btohqsg
First time doing this uob promo thing  so basically transfer 100k out by today and on the 1st April   apply for the promo and transfer back into the uob one account correct?,btohqsg
Must see the Tnc when announced.And also not sure today what‚Äôs the cut off timing that will be used.,btohqsg
I guess they want to save as much on the daily interest,btohqsg
Extra days of high interest gone that‚Äôs why need to take some risk to do it today,btohqsg
If empty the uob one  will we still get the prorated March interest?,btohqsg
Nope. If u do high level method. Won‚Äôt affect at all.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/182078,btohqsg
It doesn't matter. If you planned early and have 115k for 27 days  you'll still get $4.25ish base interest. Your MAB is still at least 100k to get a total of 4.99% EIR.If you really want to min-max  then keep in 114815 till 27 Mar. You'll get the 5% EIR.,btohqsg
Living life on the edge üòÑ,btohqsg
So far  those who have done before„ÄÇwhat interest did you get in that month when you empty the $100k for that few days,btohqsg
Would it make sense to get some longer term US treasury bonds? Quite good price now,btohqsg
I heard he kenna a few times. Always ask people how come they get the reward he never get. lol.People say him many time he still don‚Äôt change. They gave up.,btohqsg
The max 5% pa on $100k adb. Because we use excel calculate adb to ensure $100k after factoring in days at $10.,btohqsg
Anyway now too late to do anything ‚Ä¶ just wait for the promo to surface and throw 100k back in,btohqsg
Also have rumours (I am unaware) that Uob one will be cutting rates.So if locking in for 4.5 months be prepared.,btohqsg
Yes confirmed cutting rates from 1 MAY,btohqsg
If you planned forward (keep MAB at least 100k) then 4.99%-5% p.a.If not  it will be 4.9% p.a.ish depending on how long it's emptied (MAB becomes 85k-95kish).,btohqsg
Really can‚Äôt share much but if u trust me the cut will be from 1 MAY,btohqsg
Means no more 5% EIR? Sob,btohqsg
Good things really don't last forever. I'm glad I enjoyed it for 6 months at least,btohqsg
High interest will still be there but there will be a cut,btohqsg
It's bound to happen  not if just when lol,btohqsg
Cut a bit still ok. Still better then DBS Multiplier,btohqsg
Confirmed 1 May . So enjoy one more mth,btohqsg
Hopefully no change to the criteria.,btohqsg
Saw someone post in another chat grp down to effective 4% for 150k,btohqsg
Link please? I‚Äôm sure Chris won‚Äôt mind if sharing info not referral,btohqsg
Kekeke glad that he share first. And yes it‚Äôs true,btohqsg
