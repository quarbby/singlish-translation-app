6.6 The allowable lease period will be based on the age of the youngest applicant/spouse at the date of flat application. The chosen lease must be able to last all applicants and their spouses until at least age 95. The selection of lease period will be made during the flat selection. However  if the applicant is married and the chosen lease is insufficient to cover the spouse till the age of 95  the application will be cancelled  and the applicant forfeits any deposit or fees as determined by HDB.https://resources.homes.hdb.gov.sg/web/bp13/files/Conditions%20for%20Purchase%20(Post%20HFE)%20290523.pdfHeyy all  wanted to check if anyone knew about this.
