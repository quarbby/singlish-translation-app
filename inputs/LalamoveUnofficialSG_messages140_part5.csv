I think haven't payday bah. So lesser purchase means lesser order. Hopefully it pick up next week,btohqsg
Neweys sharing my experience with another platform. Suspect Ah long case. But I didn't thought of anything as it was online payment. (Since Ah long typically is cash order).I arrived at sender void deck to dbl confirm unit no  tried calling sender cannot get thru. End up call recipient. Still cannot get thru. Then I realised sender and recipient same no. Msg also never reply. So I just went up and knock on sender door. He said he didn't order anything. Wife also said the same.So boh pian I cleared job. I was waiting for a call back from recipient in case I went to the wrong sender house. Until now also no call. So ya...,btohqsg
We may never know this ah long may want to pay u to just harass this people. Since some of us are already wary of cash job.,btohqsg
Actually this kind of orders are getting more. When u take up this kind of orders. Try calling the no  usually the no is not in use. Go to the help icon and go for call customer.. actual no usually will come up and it's usually starts with +60 no. So u will know it's a scam order..,btohqsg
Pooling service is within 4hrs  pick up within 2hrs.. save this guy's.,btohqsg
I just checked. It's +65. So I find it more strange now. I think the benefit of doubt I can give is  sender order wrongly. But just let it be since I'm already there. Cos I ever had such situation where I came down to sender to receive order and got a call from recipient that it was a wrong order/date/timing (miss comm between sender and recipient)  but they told me to just clear the job and take money since I'm already there,btohqsg
Basically llm orders anytg can happenðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Just take it in your stride. Don't get affected by screwed up or scam orders n just move on.,btohqsg
Quote b4 u confirm the order. Noone include urself is willing to do these type of orders at the base rate. Don't do blindly.,btohqsg
Real monks not rich   rich ones are corrupted monks,btohqsg
Can even send vulgar language by shouting at reciever,btohqsg
Sorry actually for pooling time for picking up what ah.? Not the normal 20 mins right,btohqsg
New day new charity job guys,btohqsg
N for regular jobs  pick up is within 30min unless it's scheduled job,btohqsg
"From a consumer POV  u see the diff between Grab and LLM in terms of pooling. If u realise for Grab They did indicate send within 4 hours unlike LLM. LLM is so vague with ""a little longer""",btohqsg
As an LLM driver  it's not even our  job to go and explain to every sender the goods will be delivered only within 4 hours. The system in LLM should be amended to indicate.,btohqsg
True. And as a LLM partners we should know the T&C not just do without knowing it.,btohqsg
"Ya. As a consumer  obviously the ""save costs"" word entice them. If u see how grab worded it  they just put the 4 hours delivery but of course in between the lines  the cost is cheaper since delivery take longer.",btohqsg
Cheap untilâ€¦.should ask them can their cake wait,btohqsg
All prices i saw is charity.. already offlineðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Now we know.. No wonder customers choose that,btohqsg
Am boycotting all this nonsense  jobs myself. See who desperate take. Take Liao less cost still got earn meh..have count the time spent,btohqsg
LLM can't even cover 1Km to a dollar.,btohqsg
Yup2.. end of the day  might as well u work fulltime cleaner. U can earn better.,btohqsg
I think those LJ fees taken by CHK!,btohqsg
Oh  so this pick up point is cake? I see their jobs quite often but I usually not in that area so not sure what's to be delivered,btohqsg
U should see the ones from Mandai Estate or West Coast area where they send cakes direct from factory. I dunno how on earth the cakes can sustain or even stack cos they send out in bulk orders like close to 10 areas. Anything happen  becomes driver fault (cake melt),btohqsg
Mandai  senoko  woodlandsâ€¦.usually those central kitchen or caterers,btohqsg
If cluster closely still can do or else add all the time n petrol spent  not worth,btohqsg
So many pooling order on friday  how to do it sia ?,btohqsg
Per hour only earn ard RM 6.50 hahahhaa... same thing to LLM SG.. which is petrol more expensive  traffic bad  if bad luck got ERP  carpark charges dont forget  customer stated wrong address or customer taking their own sweet time.. hahhaha...,btohqsg
"Best is they take ""pooling"" since LLM worded it as ""takes a little longer"".Send 10 areas will take a little longer mah ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ so that's how maybe consumers sees it",btohqsg
Got free meal somemore.. yet ppl took cheap price and mention need to put food in the table.. i dont get it... so many jobs out there when u can actually earn more...,btohqsg
U kena HDB still ok. U kena condo. Wah piang  intercom cannot get thru 1 thing  basement no reception another thing. Security dun let u go in another thing. Waste time,btohqsg
googleâ€™s ai is notoriously inaccurate  look at the indeed link below that it took from,btohqsg
$6 and $14 very big difference,btohqsg
2021 my niece work mcd part time per hour $8. Still way better,btohqsg
Now 2025 maybe increased $1 to $9. Way better right end of the day only deduct your bus mrt fare.,btohqsg
My point is  if really prices is low why took it.. we must have a standard cost of delivery to make it balance our cost of living. But if really need money so bad to support family and things that need to pay.. alot more work out there that can help out,btohqsg
Do the maths. After petrol n parking  left how much. For platform  they still earn their comm  whoever take suck thumb earn few $$.,btohqsg
Like just now the bt batok job  if go up come down usually empty car  the petrol also cost,btohqsg
Customer see this they would think only the matching will take some time  but they didnâ€™t say that the delivery will take some time..so itâ€™s really LLMâ€™s and their bad interface/payments,btohqsg
I am nearby but I also wonâ€™t take,btohqsg
Take Liao is spoil mkt for ownself n others.,btohqsg
Only when they realize nobody take the crap prices in pooling  then they LL post regular job,btohqsg
Take pooling order and let them call u or call them when u are ready to collect. Tell them u will be there in 2hours.ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚Can anot?,btohqsg
"I did that yesterday.... hahahhaha.. they called me  ask where am i... hahhhaa... i let them know collection within 2hrs and will deliver within 4hours.. cause of ""you"" book pooling. Hahaha... they cancel.. lol... so they waste their own time... not our problem.",btohqsg
"Ya anyway i was at home yesterday watching tv so i got no loss.. hahhaha.. funny part  when they asked me ""where are you"" my answer make them more angrier... ""im at home watching tv"". HahahahahahahhaaðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚",btohqsg
Today so sian.. I stay home n sleep...ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Ridiculous prices since morning... More pooling service in the app...,btohqsg
