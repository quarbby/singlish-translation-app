Hello guys! Is there anyway to make a stash account withdrawl while still making that monthâ€™s interest?,btohqsg

Strange.. for ocbc  I got the sms with redemption code and I collect my gift with that sms and credit card,btohqsg
Yes. As long as your ADB of this month is higher than ADB of previous month  you still get interest.Eg. Previous month ADB is $50k. Current month ADB before withdrawal is $100k n ADB after withdrawal is $75k.,btohqsg

In this case  I dont wish to convert to sgd bcos currently rate is too low and do I allow to transfer to another bank  let say hsbs ega. Will it incur any fee?,btohqsg

I find credit rating generally doesnt affect. But some people got say bank might not approve new apps if you keep applying & cancelling,btohqsg
I personally cannot confirm lah  dont usually apply & cancel for signup bonus,btohqsg
yeah I'm guessing that too. especially if do too often and each time never use the card substantially,btohqsg
alternatively you can get a supp card or link it to gpay/apple pay for payments - these methods can't access your UNI$,btohqsg
