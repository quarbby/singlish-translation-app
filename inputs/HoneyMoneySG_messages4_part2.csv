maybe will ask my wife to top up for me.,btohqsg
Not 8k  maybe only 3k. It is the gap of opportunity when the BHS is increased,btohqsg
Top up spouse only qualify if the beneficiary is not earning more than $4000 annual income,btohqsg
Otherwise  i top up for wife  wife top up for me  both get tax relief I think IRAS go bankrupt soon,btohqsg
Just work on reaching BHS with MA  the rest can think later,btohqsg
ðŸ‘Œ still can enjoy the same tax relief like how we top up 8k to SA ?,btohqsg
is it in this order:1. Overflow from MA when BHS is reached2. Transfer OA to SA3. Top up SA?,btohqsg
1 and 2 can do together at the same time. 3 is last,btohqsg
"I did my cpf videos few months ago detailing my strategy for each OA MA and SA  can go look at ""Revealing my CPF"" videos 2021 may jun july",btohqsg
Of course the MA strategy needs to be updated now,btohqsg
So just shoot for BHS in MA first,btohqsg
do you top up every month or every year?,btohqsg
hello chris  once u reach frs and bhs  monthly salary will still split accordingly to sa oa ma ? does it mean that the excess at sa and ma will earn 4% and auto transfer to OA during YE ?,btohqsg
Once frs and bhs metOa go to oaSa go to saMa go to oa.Refer to the CPF Bucket and tap pic,btohqsg
Hi chris  do we vc3a also at the start of the year for self employed?,btohqsg
If I already top up SA 8k this year   Isit recommended to still top up the Ma to max it out this year ? Or wait till next year,btohqsg
I think that depends on whether you have other investment opportunities elsewhere.,btohqsg
Up to you based on your cash flow for self employed. But do earlier for compounding interest and tax relief,btohqsg
Wait till next year since no more tax relief,btohqsg
Ohh .. but SA less than 100k   ard 80k and MA 59k . So would u recommend next year how much to top up and to which acc?,btohqsg
VCMA max to BHS  remainder do RSTU,btohqsg
Next year Ma will increase again? Or stil at 66k,btohqsg
Every year will increase. Both FRS and BHS,btohqsg
if you watched the video  it's mentioned 3% YoY,btohqsg
FRS will be capped at the year you reach 55.BHS will be capped at the year you reach 65,btohqsg
Anyone bought SP500?Good time to go in now?,btohqsg

But buying the dip on red days is a sound strategy  just be prepared it may dip further,btohqsg

Whats the syfe trade? Isit like tiger/ moo brokers ?,btohqsg
Yes but they advertise as able to buy partial stocks so I wonder if its similar to eToro,btohqsg
