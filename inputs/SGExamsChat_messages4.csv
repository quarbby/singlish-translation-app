which is when 'normal BMT' begins,btohqsg
Yeah you gotta know people and they gotta trust you. Also  internship shorter than 3 months is waste time.,btohqsg
Consider doing the intern after NS,btohqsg
You'll have time before uni starts anyway,btohqsg
smart  i wasted my 2 yrs :(,btohqsg
t u i t i o n,btohqsg
For me I voluntarily joined organising committee for an event and I'm trying to complete cs50,btohqsg
NS time is quite difficult for internships,btohqsg
So if you want to do something that helps you might want to consider something more adhoc,btohqsg
Something you can complete on your own time,btohqsg
if u tryin cs50 to prepare for comp sci,btohqsg
my fren did that and she dropped out of comp sci after the first sem,btohqsg
i would say is impt in seeing whether u like comp sci or not  but the rigour isnt similar,btohqsg
I'm doing a DDP anyway so if I do drop comp Sci I'll still have another major,btohqsg
And if I find out I hate my other major then lol I guess I'll die,btohqsg
I dont need to imagine  alrd there,btohqsg
Tbh one of the weeks it just went,btohqsg
Oh you know how to program C,btohqsg
ah seems like its almost same as mine  except that I'm DEFINITELY dropping the 2nd degree,btohqsg
u gonna go with the bond free scholarship,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt know you were in a DDP,btohqsg
oh wow toxic john strikes again,btohqsg
The scholarship doesn't go with the ddp?,btohqsg
I thought you were just in cs,btohqsg
@XenonShawnif you are awarded with it,btohqsg
The part I didn't know was,btohqsg
By right nus has the right to take away the scholarship,btohqsg
So I have no idea whether if I drop one of my degrees they'll let me continue,btohqsg
And my home degree is math rn so apparently I can only drop CS?,btohqsg
they said  highly likely its transferable,btohqsg
nah i think is possible to jump to cs,btohqsg
but is best to enquire to confirm,btohqsg
Idk which to pick between Cs and math anyway,btohqsg
so u are tryin to say its bad,btohqsg
If you're not officer  need waste more time with OCS,btohqsg
well at least we are debt free,btohqsg
Chances of me being an officer is practically zero,btohqsg
That doesn't answer whether you are in OFFR,btohqsg
Up to yall but all I can say is bond free scholarships are massively overrated by A-level equiv peeps,btohqsg
so is not that good la,btohqsg
which i agree to some extent,btohqsg
A bond scholarship would probably suit me more,btohqsg
But eh for now it'll do,btohqsg
are u entering uni this yr?,btohqsg
ah then u still have time,btohqsg
Then I realise I hate children,btohqsg
most ppl on bond free scholarship offers last yr didn't get interviewed right,btohqsg
ye man take MOE TS and go to private tuition industry once bond ends :),btohqsg
my chemistry teacher inspired me to do that,btohqsg
cos he was an irl example,btohqsg
Is it teaching or go HQ? Going HQ has no children involvement,btohqsg
At HQ you deal with old geezers with too many policy power and massive budgets to spend,btohqsg
I don't think I'll be able to stand pri or sec students,btohqsg
If you take MOE TS you have to go to school for 2 years I think,btohqsg
After that you can just hide in HQ,btohqsg
i didnt know u were an avid investor,btohqsg
I think this is what my fellow intern is planning to do,btohqsg
Only if you can afford it tho  lmao,btohqsg
ye man they are showing a small rebound from their fall earlier,btohqsg
She has 44 IB she can do whatever she wants,btohqsg
prob still shy of the 50th percentile of rp scores an A lvl grad in MOE JCTIP has,btohqsg
I might actually consider MOE tho,btohqsg
Do 2 years and hide in HQ? I feel so sorry for the guinea pigs in that 2 years,btohqsg
Theoretically speaking DSTA is not a horrible stat board,btohqsg
its horrible though cos of the toxicity,btohqsg
but if u can handle it  ur life isnt that bad,btohqsg
speaking of that  my friend is prob gonna get destroyed and stay in the lower rungs potentially for life,btohqsg
There are stat boards which scream AVOID AVOID EVADE EVADE PERFORM EVASIVE MANEUVERS NOW,btohqsg
thats why i nvr considered it,btohqsg
Not all places tossic tho I think,btohqsg
CAG and CAS different things by the way,btohqsg
Oh ya  missed one A out,btohqsg
I don't think they would participate even if they were here,btohqsg
actually the most shiniest of them all is Jardine,btohqsg
Shiniest is father-mother scholarship with holidays during undergrad time fully paid for,btohqsg
So 1 undergrad year 2 or more trips,btohqsg
maybe to Cologne or something 'CULTURAL TRIP',btohqsg
I think there's at least one psc scholar in this group tho,btohqsg
Means you go fly Paris buy 2 LV tab fully settled,btohqsg
I think he means statistically  at least 1 out of 2000 group members is a PSCholar,btohqsg
You can go overseas for no reason and they'll still pay for it?,btohqsg
What tier? PSC also tiered like mad today,btohqsg
I'm afraid it's doxxing tho even though I'm not exactly sure if that person is psc,btohqsg
You have a specific person in mind?,btohqsg
Well  I assume you never seen the party goers with infinite money before,btohqsg
In some sense they also don't only get PSC scholars in eleetus part of SG Govt any more,btohqsg
With more mid-career switches allowable and all,btohqsg
Yeah I saw one poly person in the psc awardee list in 2018,btohqsg
No I don't mean they diversify the PSCs themselves  I mean like if you are some SGean without problematic security background (e.g. You go to Grace Assembly and are a young Divisional Director in UBS you are welcome to join the high ranks of SG's Civil Service),btohqsg
Even though said person may never have done anything related to civil service ever,btohqsg
As for token diversification  well  it's done by all oligarchies. Can't maintain the illusion of a democracy without the tokens,btohqsg
Hii has anyone taken the ucat test before? Can pm me thankss!,btohqsg
And then I'll offer to give soon's children tuition,btohqsg
I'll smack my kids until they learn to study on their own,btohqsg
no tuition squad where yall at,btohqsg
smack them with a bat or what,btohqsg
it doesn't work unless they're traumatized by it,btohqsg
smack them wit that guilt trip,btohqsg
"""i work so hard and i try my best to giveu  guys a happy childhood but yall too lazy to study haiz.. i dont know where i went wrong""",btohqsg
‚ÄùI raise you for x number of years feed you bathe you but still so unappreciative ‰∏çË¶ÅÂ•ΩÂ•ΩÂ≠¶‰π†‚Äù,btohqsg
"""My boss slap me yesterday but I have to continue working to sustain the family and pay for your education""",btohqsg
To help keep your children on the right track,btohqsg
For a measly fee of $150/hr,btohqsg
But I would like to expose them to tons of different things,btohqsg
Don't worry  Adam khoo will do this for you.,btohqsg
Lmao they made me cry during their workshop,btohqsg
I think my school never did the Adam Khoo thing,btohqsg
"isit coz he did the ""think about your parents"" thingy or Smth else",btohqsg
but apparently he's left such a great legacy even my sec sch tchr's sch did the Adam Khoo thing LMAO and she's like 30 or smth,btohqsg
Someone who tells young kids to imagine their parents dead or something.,btohqsg
TIA GONG only I have no 1st-hand evidence,btohqsg
but that's what I've heard frm my tchr too,btohqsg
Basically applying neurolinguistic programming (nlp) to guilt you into studying harder for the few months leading up to exam. Often involves coercing students to promise their parents they will get all As and study very hard.,btohqsg
Gave NLP a very bad name in the corp world.,btohqsg
You better believe he's raking in moolah,btohqsg
He moved on to wealth and investment coaching. Applying similar tactics but more advanced with finance content to adults.,btohqsg
But company still doin the dirty,btohqsg
Like then they darken the room,btohqsg
I think my entire cohort was crying,btohqsg
Yup gotta inflict psychological horror on impressionable young kids,btohqsg
Adam Khoo earned so much money from schools peddling his snake oil camps,btohqsg
guilt trip = study harder LOL,btohqsg
stupid adam khoo suck our money,btohqsg
Sure bo is Adam Khoo so old??,btohqsg
Who doesn't know who that guy is,btohqsg
Good that you don‚Äôt know Adam Khoo,btohqsg
I‚Äôve never seen Adam Khoo except on TV  annoying YouTube ads and newspapers in the past,btohqsg
We have been the blessed children of Jesus Christ,btohqsg
I saw him at a cinema before ahem ahem,btohqsg
Oh no does that mean I‚Äôm not a blessed child HAHAH,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt even spell my name right,btohqsg
Morning. Does anyone have H1 Art  Chem  Phy and Bio notes they wish to give away? Lemme know yea ^_^,btohqsg

Anyone have pdf notes or questions for olvl?,btohqsg
hi  is anyone interested on working on a short film with me? i plan on submitting it to film festivals and competitions,btohqsg
i alr have an idea in mind,btohqsg
I wouldnt but I had an exam,btohqsg
I would if I'm not so busy with my own projects alr kek,btohqsg
can send me? want more haha,btohqsg
yall think i can juggle 3 cca in poly anot,btohqsg
If you want filmmakers to give feedback and mentor  can let me know,btohqsg
cause im interested in 3 different ccas,btohqsg
student union  business management club and kendo,btohqsg
then if u feel u can cope then join another,btohqsg
idk sia i interested in all 3,btohqsg
has anhone applied for the enterprise sg scholarship,btohqsg
like after u submit ur app thru brightsparks u get directed to another form right,btohqsg
whats it abt (i cant rly do it now since in camp),btohqsg
its only a week in and my notes are all everywher,btohqsg
all stacked and clipped in between my fullscaps wtv,btohqsg
which lvl of education you're in?,btohqsg
and my study place becomes a mes,btohqsg
si suck at being neat man,btohqsg
I read that as ‚ÄúI suck at beating meat man‚Äù,btohqsg
Lol no  just dirty minded only üôÉ,btohqsg
You have to be neat every single day,btohqsg
So every day if you‚Äôve moved something  move it back,btohqsg
If you‚Äôve taken a thing out of your file  file it back,btohqsg
is it weird that I'm super neat and organized in some aspects of my life,btohqsg
and yet my room is always super messy,btohqsg
The inconsistency is what makes you the way u are ‚ú®,btohqsg
and i‚Äôll make notes and file it in,btohqsg
i used to write notes on notebooks,btohqsg
and my study space like small,btohqsg
i put com and one book barely any space left,btohqsg
i try to organize once a week cause if i don't  my mom comes and makes everything perfect and my dad will guilt trip me kek,btohqsg
i mean those are my pencils but,btohqsg
like i dont got room for anythhh,btohqsg
You should see my life when exams approach :v,btohqsg
wa the month before a levels  i sat down for an entire sunday and sorted my stack of papers,btohqsg
I‚Äôd get like a new organizer  throw out old books and notes from like primary school or something,btohqsg
(Cuz I have a strange problem of hoarding those),btohqsg
Are there any engineering poly kids looking for group like during exams cuz I feel like I could probably use some good influence of studious kids,btohqsg
I personally kept everything in files and file cases,btohqsg
And then threw them into a cupboard,btohqsg
It's not messy if you can't see them,btohqsg
According to this guy memory is freehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbipJUJLzpE,btohqsg
That's actually pretty neat compared to mine HAHAHHA,btohqsg
Same but I not engi kekeke,btohqsg
I like the way you think,btohqsg
If so why not make it more permanent,btohqsg
Either burn or shred your stuff,btohqsg
Then you don't need ever see them,btohqsg
Just in case I need them lol,btohqsg
You know that junior who asks you for help with a math question two years after you graduated,btohqsg
And then you already forgotten everything,btohqsg
i threw out quite alot liao,btohqsg
but like my jc notes still need keep,btohqsg
but idk what i rlly need to keep or not and where man üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Guys do lemme know ah? :),btohqsg
If you're in CS  you do CS research,btohqsg
What's likely is that given the current market  you do machine learning / AI,btohqsg
If your profs are highly technical  then you do specialised CS research (I'd say quite rare),btohqsg
CNYSP  research is part of the curriculum,btohqsg
i think u pick 1 easier,btohqsg
I'm assuming if you do CS research  you'll look into Deep Learning/neural nets,btohqsg
CNYSP either sponsor the flight  or you ownself will fly over because not every Tom Dick goes to NIPS,btohqsg
Anyway no one here can tell you what 'benefits' are the best,btohqsg
You need to structure your questions so that they have objective outcomes and/or advice can be given,btohqsg
Err...benefits are to mankind? Because you research and develop new methods and applications of science and tech?,btohqsg
It certainly doesn't sound like this guy wants to be altruistic.,btohqsg
Think so too but wanted to present an alternative. I'd not be too keen on accepting a scholar who is looking for personal benefit. Unless the perceived personal benefit is the chance to contribute to growing the knowledge.,btohqsg
But hey  I'm not on the interview panel for those scholarships.,btohqsg
NTU is very easy to get,btohqsg
i rmb tan choon hong skyping me for CNYang,btohqsg
depends what CAP u want lor,btohqsg
prob comparable to a double major equivalent,btohqsg
den i'd say it's quite manageable,btohqsg
u just need to chug along,btohqsg
Enough to escape jail for crimes,btohqsg
GREETINGS  FELLOW STUDENTS. HOW'S YOUR DAY,btohqsg
I finally found out what my class is and all my og mates are not there,btohqsg
I CAME BECAUSE OF MY GOOD FRIEND  KUEH,btohqsg

koushi is this degen from discord,btohqsg
he'll stop barking if u dont mention him,btohqsg
But you can use it in telegram,btohqsg
Why your pfp here so boring btw,btohqsg
Or you include your pfp but only to your 'contacts',btohqsg
If you mean 977 confirmed cases sure,btohqsg
I don't understand what's so special about VSCO,btohqsg
I have been hearing abt it,btohqsg
But I rly don't understand what the context is,btohqsg
I thought VSCO was viCtorIa sChoOl Chinese orchestra,btohqsg
That's what I learnt from my prev sch lel,btohqsg
i use it to edit food pics,btohqsg
where can i apply to be a mod i graduated from being a student so i think i qualify,btohqsg
u gotta have at least 80iq to be a mod,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt even tell that‚Äôs food,btohqsg
wdf my iq more than 100!!,btohqsg
At most 80IQ to be discord mod,btohqsg
A bit too black for my liking,btohqsg
i am from a design course i do not understand this,btohqsg
move your finger 2 buttons up,btohqsg
What made u transition to tele kou,btohqsg
the promise of kueh loving me and making me an admin,btohqsg
no one ever loved u and im not gonna be the first,btohqsg
wdf... i thought tele people very nice one...,btohqsg
I have so many degen sticker packs,btohqsg
Wait why this sticker pack 1 crab also consider flex,btohqsg
What will happen when someone PES F? ü§î,btohqsg
Wat do you mean ‚Äòwhat will happen‚Äô,btohqsg
They‚Äôll just not go for NS,btohqsg
Those who PES F will magically teleport to Mars,btohqsg
There they will find a Mass Relay,btohqsg
people cry about icecream cone ending the end,btohqsg
That cant be fired without explicit permission,btohqsg
Well  I can fire it without any permission,btohqsg
All the easier to stalk out John once he reveals his role and camp he‚Äôs posted to,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been quarantined in Kranji for the past 2 days,btohqsg
Anybody in recon rn i heard they using some carbine sia,btohqsg
We had to stay in 2 weeks for our first time booking in,btohqsg
Will they have difficulties looking for job or whatsoever,btohqsg
we will find out once reservist,btohqsg
Employer probably will wonder why pes f and if it'll affect work,btohqsg
Let's say you're a person who hiring ppl for a company,btohqsg
the foreigner will take up ur job scope,btohqsg
Would you choose someone who might need to suddenly go away for two weeks,btohqsg
den after that ask for promotion,btohqsg
while u outfield bang bang bang,btohqsg
is that why Sporeans arent really getting those high ranking jobs in pte sector?,btohqsg
for ten unknown years which nobody knows when,btohqsg
isn‚Äôt it random and as and when they like ?,btohqsg
Oh  you mean each in camp training,btohqsg
My senior tio callback in uni liao sia,btohqsg
need clear 2 yrs of ippt 1st,btohqsg
No need ask just go xdddd,btohqsg
leave the bino and the icts at bunk,btohqsg
The specific person i know has perfect gpa in nus rn so probably not lol,btohqsg
he got out of jail card also,btohqsg
But yea civil sector might ask why u pes f,btohqsg
did he went for internship yet,btohqsg
armor learn icts and ahhti all that but yall use?,btohqsg
We exactly the same as other recon just that we take bronco,btohqsg
is he PES F from the start or halfway through PES F?,btohqsg
i see. i wonder what will happen to those that are PES F halfway through‚Ä¶ cuz dk whether uni will take them in a year earlier,btohqsg
My coymate pes f halfway through he went to work private for 1 year then matriculate as usual,btohqsg
now civilian la suits u better,btohqsg
i see. how long did he served in the Army before getting PES F?,btohqsg
No longer than 8 months including bmt lol,btohqsg
Im so done with MINDEF now,btohqsg
i see. cuz i know of someone getting PES F this April. But dk whether he will be able to matriculate into uni this year or have to wait until next year,btohqsg
the speed they process things really win liao lo,btohqsg
I apply DXO they reject me,btohqsg
Lo is for past tense dude.,btohqsg
then who da hell are they keeping the positions for? for it to rot?,btohqsg
What condition got him PES F,btohqsg
Diploma preferred. Im undertaking PT diploma from Singapore Poly,btohqsg
Oh so mental health issues ah,btohqsg
Bcos im a PA rn  i applied for PA also,btohqsg
does anyone know or have any idea regading this? or that the person i know should call his uni and check with them,btohqsg
Wa bro dun make me slap the fuck outta you plsü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
walao eh. later kenna troll by them sibei siaxuay,btohqsg
i sumpa memedef wont troll u,btohqsg
is it cuz memedef is by u?,btohqsg
no  but ive been there for a long while,btohqsg
most of the dudes there are fine  unless u ask really bodoh questions,btohqsg
with no way to increasre itt,btohqsg
in NS already  but my PES is non combat fit,btohqsg
basically to me  SAF pays NSFs according to their physical and mental health  so if u dun have good physical or mental health  u will be likely to get PES C/E which the majority of the highest rank is Corporal if u even make through BMT.,btohqsg
?_? SAF pays NSFs according to rank and riskpay,btohqsg
yea‚Ä¶ but do u ever see PES C/F working as Officers in clerk like conditions? no?but what i do see are officers that are doing paperwork,btohqsg
For what it's worth  all the officers doing paperwork have gone through OCS which isn't exactly some deca-ironman but it isn't easy either,btohqsg
The logic is that you are serving national service,btohqsg
When you are able to vote,btohqsg
Long story short  no need get any simpler,btohqsg
not all people are well suited to be inside,btohqsg
that's why gov pwn sinkies with trade deals like CECA,btohqsg
If you up PES you‚Äôre stuck at PTE/LCP,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not satisfied with the fact that they won‚Äôt let us vote but they deem us old enough to put our lives at risk in the military,btohqsg
He kp me wear vest slag today,btohqsg
In murai u can vest slack anywhr ,btohqsg
I wear from office to toilet like 10m only walao,btohqsg
Hey anyone know of any hawker centres near Labrador park,btohqsg
I only signed myself up for math,btohqsg
But I need to teach English n science today,btohqsg
kueh where is govtech at ah,btohqsg
Depends on which office you going to.,btohqsg
But the mapletree one is right beside arc.,btohqsg
arc food not that good leh tbh,btohqsg
hello anyone has any tips for geog elect gi?,btohqsg
anyone know if private candidates need contrasting subject?,btohqsg
One office at Labrador park another one at one-north,btohqsg
Idk how big the labrador park office is tho tbh,btohqsg
Got like 3-4 floors and shit,btohqsg
O wow maybe one north smaller office,btohqsg
Afaik it has 2 maybe more floors therre,btohqsg
But my only comparison was dsta with 20+ floors,btohqsg
What did you sign up for?,btohqsg
Ya but not all c0ders ma,btohqsg
Like if you decide to change subjects,btohqsg
Sun protection is nice I guess,btohqsg
well I only have 1 sample point HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Maybe you should bring food from home,btohqsg
and all the people here probably earn enough to not bat an eye,btohqsg
Maybe even the 7 eleven meals are good,btohqsg
That‚Äôs better than eating plain rice ü§© (not much better),btohqsg
7eleven microwave meals are actually pretty good for what you're paying,btohqsg
>_> do I need to give you a lecture on health education,btohqsg
Come on guys  primary school stuff,btohqsg
Carbs aren‚Äôt the only macro nutrient you need,btohqsg
Is this why you are so ‚Äòbuff‚Äô,btohqsg
Starch is a poly saccharide so it‚Äôs also a sugar,btohqsg
when a physics student trying to decode a bio statement,btohqsg
I always ask for extra rice for breakfast lunch and dinner rations,btohqsg
This is actually quite basic but ok,btohqsg
you have to sustain your buffness,btohqsg
... Since when do they serve rice for breakfast,btohqsg
Xmm needs to gain some fats,btohqsg
It‚Äôs either fried rice or fried noodles,btohqsg
isnt it weird i eat a fuck ton in the morning and then eat nothing at night,btohqsg
Maybe if it wasn‚Äôt corn pea carrot every single time,btohqsg
Man I keep finding things to dox John with,btohqsg
no wonder i cant get fat,btohqsg
Maybe my taste buds are too plain,btohqsg
People who ask for extra rice despite the amount of unnecessary carbs Asians eat all the time in Singapore scare the shit outta me,btohqsg
I can always get you a picture of him COUGH,btohqsg
Just ambush me outside camp on Friday,btohqsg
imagine ordering spaghetti and having extra pasta >_>,btohqsg
I assure you I don‚Äôt have any unnecessary carbs in BMT,btohqsg
But nah after friday live firing i'll be too tired,btohqsg
If I ever do that  it‚Äôs not me. Run,btohqsg
People in America don't eat as much rice,btohqsg
Also I‚Äôm a stick so it‚Äôs ok for me to eat more,btohqsg
*actually joins in to eat spaghet*,btohqsg
Because they have something called glucose and sucrose,btohqsg
They put sugar in everything  even their low fat foods,btohqsg
physics actually at the top of the pyramid,btohqsg
I‚Äôll leave it to you guys to figure out that low fat foods have higher sugar content,btohqsg
Do you know what the M word is,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt seem to read it,btohqsg
when u come back they figure out alr :),btohqsg
Try comparing two products of the same brand (I used meji milk) and see which has higher sugar content,btohqsg
Every good bio lesson had an experiment,btohqsg
weirdly tho hl milk and meiji milk tastes very different,btohqsg
hl milk is fucking thick bro,btohqsg
To ask a legit qn now,btohqsg
Any NUS/NTU comp sci undergrads here? If so is 3.75 cap easy to maintain?,btohqsg
Idk I used to drink that when I was younger,btohqsg
My theory is that the higher ur gpa the more likely you are to be mentally ill,btohqsg
very doable as long as you're not complete dog shit haha,btohqsg
Did u just agree to my agreement of ur statement? üòÇ,btohqsg
i wanna gun for ddp with chem,btohqsg
icic  are u around there then ? =0,btohqsg
