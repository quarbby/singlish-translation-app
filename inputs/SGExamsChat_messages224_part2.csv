see you arnd biz sch hopefully,btohqsg
Business studies requires specialisation in the second year,btohqsg
my friend was in biz studies she say q easy lol,btohqsg
Business studies is different from ITB,btohqsg
ITB only has like 75 people,btohqsg
isnt BS like marketing all these stuff,btohqsg
There‚Äôs also entrepreneurship and human capital I think,btohqsg
I wanted business but figured im not the best at econs so i chose TRM bc its more ppl oriented jobs HAHA,btohqsg
Sometimes it‚Äôs like those 2CU mods like innova preventing you from getting your perfect GPA,btohqsg
u probably can get np scholarship,btohqsg
aiya whatever just apply after 28 January,btohqsg
no is they auto give u one iirc,btohqsg
at least according to my friend,btohqsg
Like after you apply for the course?,btohqsg
Well just have to wait until 28 January then,btohqsg
My main concern is the team projects,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs just paper exams I can mug,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs individual projects I might struggle but should be manageable if I just grind in the library,btohqsg
You‚Äôre in biz I assume got many group proj,btohqsg
ppl on reddit told me business more exam based,btohqsg
I think I probably applying for internship immediately after,btohqsg
Idk if there‚Äôs still innova I grad from NP years ago,btohqsg
why need to be so upz,btohqsg
Some innovation mod I think every student need take but I not in NP anymore so idk if it‚Äôs still there,btohqsg
I want to enter SMU so need top grades to be safe,btohqsg
And I want some holistic experience and networking,btohqsg
Can improve my inept social skills too,btohqsg
Many of my friends 3.9 because of that mod,btohqsg

I‚Äôm already in a parachurch lol,btohqsg

Probably gonna have a mission trip next year,btohqsg
singapore track and field in general is a mess,btohqsg
Ya I know the standards are trash,btohqsg
eh actl whats there to do,btohqsg
i nvr rlly found volunteer opportunities so i js stuck to library stuff,btohqsg

building housing for people in Papua New Guinea,btohqsg
the nsa is in a mess,btohqsg
bruh moe apologised to the trans student and still used the wrong pronouns üòê,btohqsg
Notice how it referred to the student as ‚Äòhim‚Äô,btohqsg
I mean the concerned person is still biologically a male...,btohqsg
and she had mentioned herself that by making and forcing her to fit a male‚Äôs standards etc its causing her trauma and distress? so,btohqsg
wld u purposely call someone stupid if it causes the person distress?,btohqsg
Since MOE is conservative  they won‚Äôt be accepting of this,btohqsg
"Bec if its a publically made statement  it makes sense to use the ""right"" pronoun",btohqsg
Where will one draw the line then? Hypothetically if i were to demand that my pronoun was to be called fuckmaster69  would it be necessary for others to respect it and address it as such?,btohqsg
I dont think its about the public nature or the form of transmission  I think it reflects a stance by 'MOE' (or the guy who manages the MOE fb) that they do not take the pronoun thing seriously.,btohqsg
Ya but even if they didn't have such a stance  they technically have a valid reason to use a 'he' instead,btohqsg
But that would imply that they accept the agenda isnt it,btohqsg
