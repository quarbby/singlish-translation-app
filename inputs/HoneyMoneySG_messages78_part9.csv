Hi all. Need some advice on UOB Xmas Savings promotion. Read Ts and Cs but still not sure.a. I emptied my account on 30 Sep; I submitted the Form on 1 Oct; and deposited $100K on 1 Oct.b. My earmark didnt happen because my balance dropped below $100k for a few days from 25-30 Oct. (i must be blur to think that I only need the $100k earmark amount by 31 Oct).c. In this case  my reference 30 Sep amount is still $0. Can I still submit the Form now in Dec  and earmark by 31 Jan and end the earmark by 15 April 2024? If so  do I need to withdraw to another bank account  and deposit the $100k again?Thanks for advice.,btohqsg
can refresh my understanding again  what does 95% of Non Comp applications allocated?,btohqsg
The YouTrip Googlepay promo got any minimum spending? Can I spend 0.10 cent x 10 times?,btohqsg
ensure most of december 2023 and ENTIRE January 2024 you have $100k incremental + 30th Sep balance amount... then the earmark will happen in January 2024.what is your account situation in November and December? Was the $100k inside all along?From what I have observed  UOB requires you to have the $100k FOR MOST OF THE ENTIRE PRIOR MONTH + ENTIRE EARMARK MONTH then the earmark will happen in the earmark monthFor example you must have $100k in early October 2023 + entire November 2023 then the earmark will happen in November 2023.,btohqsg
If I apply 100k NC bid  I will only be alloted approx 95k at 3.74%. Note that approx 95%,btohqsg
Any other cards to be able to use upwards of 1k? Or cashback cards to recco?,btohqsg
SC Journey 2 mpd with FX rebate till 31 Dec 2023https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/151067,btohqsg
1. My situation was that I had 5 days from 25-30 Oct below 100k.2. So I can still submit a NEW Participation Form in the Dec period now right  even though I submitted once before in Oct and didnt meet the criteria.,btohqsg
yeah i think no harm to submit the form again NOW..but if you submit the form NOW  i would suggest you also transfer in the $100k fresh funds NOW  and do not touch it at all from NOW till the earmark happens around 20th January 2024.,btohqsg

Pls see first before report lei faint,btohqsg

nothing wrong with the post  maybe the link redirected from fb looks too longhttps://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/cpf-interest-rates-special-medisave-and-retirement-accounts-raised-408,btohqsg
need some explanation here  how much is 1 KF mile? if 1 dollar 4 KF miles so 1 KF mile isn't 0.25¬†cent?,btohqsg
You earn 4 miles per $1 spent  the miles can be redeemed for primarily flights with SIA. For example a one-way flight to Japan business class is 52 000 miles  which means you have spent $13 000 on a 4mpd card to accumulate this 52 000 miles.,btohqsg
Let's say the flight is worth $1040 to purchase using cash. That makes the miles earned have a value of 104000/52000 = 2 cents per mile.,btohqsg
Sa and ma same interest rate what,btohqsg
If I use an amaze card to tap on a physical  will I get 10x points for Citi rewards card?,btohqsg
Travel expense partially nerfed from next year on. I personally use UOB KF for travel expenses after revo if any   but I think u can consider other cards like DBS WWMC too (assuming it‚Äôs online),btohqsg
Speaking of CPF  is there any platforms or something able to use our CPF OA to invest in higher interest rate financial products?,btohqsg
beware of certain merchants having MCCs that will incur extra 1% charge - common ones you might mistakenly paywave at are miniso,btohqsg
Also can consider looking at TBills  though for this you‚Äôll have to sign up via banks,btohqsg
My CPF OA less than 20k thou,btohqsg
Does it make sense to use Instarem with CRMC overseas assuming that there‚Äôs SCB Journey card for this month?,btohqsg
Just went to Endowus website to check about investing with CPF OA,btohqsg
Thanks for the info  so those restaurant eg: Din Tai Fung is going to be rewarded 10xpoints as well. Just confuse does it convert to online food or just all change to online shopping whatever physical transaction I made,btohqsg
that'll depend on your valuation of a mile  since using amaze+CRMC means you're paying about 2% more over base MC/Visa rates for 2 more mpd,btohqsg
Then don‚Äôt think can invest anywhere . CPF regulation,btohqsg
