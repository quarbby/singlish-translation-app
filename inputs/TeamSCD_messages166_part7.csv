If you wanna go into track days and gymkhanas,btohqsg
Also a good platform to start,btohqsg
Comes in manual unless you're not a class 3 elite.,btohqsg
Classmates were drawing dicks during the photography lessons ðŸ« ,btohqsg
It has the looks la  but slower compared to swifts,btohqsg
Swift sport has highest HP for NA 1.6L and weighs one of the lightest.On track easily can beat or keep up with NA 2.0L cars,btohqsg
And i am not saying those lancer EX2.0  or mazda 6.,btohqsg
But proper GT86 or MX5s 2L sports cars,btohqsg
Large just due to the weight,btohqsg
If u need space or looks then it's diff lor,btohqsg
U have to do a lot of research,btohqsg
And being an out of production car means u have to import parts often,btohqsg
For first car assumming u still young  dont really recommend getting something fancy la,btohqsg
Unless ur daddy rich paying for everything then ya get a lambo,btohqsg
If not anything 2L turbo and above  i dare say insurancr a year is 3k to 5k,btohqsg
I've seen many young wrx owners paying 5k for insurance a year,btohqsg
Have to take into consideration also,btohqsg
5k a year plus ur depre maybe 12k a year,btohqsg
Is equals to 17k depre a year,btohqsg
That puts into perspective how expensive shit is,btohqsg
Alot of kids nowadays all keep saying like wah i wan evo for first car  GTR for first car  Type R for first car.Ya your daddy rich can ba,btohqsg
Lucky I uncle Liao got ncd,btohqsg
Daddy rich want more also can,btohqsg
Unless u love the car shape and need space to sacrifice for performance,btohqsg
Depends on what you want really,btohqsg
Fd1 i dont think insurance expensive,btohqsg
Honda's a bit expensive right now... The cs3 more affordable,btohqsg
Enough tech to make sure you dont bang into walls,btohqsg
if u mod it right it looks nice also,btohqsg
Even Honda fits cost a bomb,btohqsg
Must be everyone wants to be like@ToufuTigerHonda fit race car,btohqsg
Mazda 3 hatch got the looks,btohqsg
But much more expensive than sedan,btohqsg
I would love to have an eg,btohqsg
The previous model hatch also not bad looking,btohqsg
Actually hatch in general very nice,btohqsg
The hatch I want is the colt turbo,btohqsg
But it's because my mom used to have a colt  same body shape,btohqsg
Im under the ugly category den,btohqsg
So nice  i can only take photos in carparks ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Whats your objective in having a car,btohqsg
From there u can avoid regrets,btohqsg
I wanted an eco friendly  family car which led me to a 1.3L 4 door  for example,btohqsg
If not will be all regrets,btohqsg
I want a car got performance can go track but also family oriented,btohqsg
That's what I tot. Type R also can actually,btohqsg
"So take the ""economical"" 1.3L that@chloetherx8mentioned",btohqsg
If I got money  instead of evo or typeR I get is300 instead,btohqsg
One day  I will get rx8,btohqsg
When I change job to higher pay,btohqsg
