"üöÄPika World Update- 16 Nov 2021üöÄ‚öîÔ∏èThe Race for the next Fed Chairman‚è≥The market will soon receive a new sense of volatility as President Biden prepares to announce his preferred candidate to serve as the Federal Reserve chair. The hot race to the finishing line presents two candidates: Fed Governor Lael Brainard and Uncle Powell.President Biden had met with both candidates last week  and it seems that the market is hoping for an announcement soon to remove uncertainty. There is speculation that the decision could be released before Thanksgiving.In general  the market seems to prefer Uncle Powell and sees him as the forerunner in the nomination race since he has both the support of Democrats and Republicans. So essentially  it is not a given for his confirmation  but markets generally believe that his re-appointment would be an easier path than getting a new candidate on board.üé¢Uncle Powell thePreferred CandidateüíéNot all is rosy for Uncle Powell  especially with Elizabeth Warren  who had publicly announced her opposition and called Powell a ""dangerous man"" in September  especially so with the recent disclosures by Fed officials over their trading matter. This had eroded Uncle Powell's credibility.On the other camp is the progressive Democrats who are advocating for Brainard as he is seen as a more dovish guy on the monetary policy front and is a firm hand on bank regulation. His nomination would signal to the market that the party of easy money continues. Nonetheless  it might be difficult for Republicans to accept her  as they viewed her as too progressive.Even when the Fed Chair seat is filled  there are many other positions on the Fed's board to fill. There is a clear intention that the White House will tap onto the remaining seats to be filled to advance their ambition of a robust employment prospect.If there is a light note  it seems that the betting markets are predicting Uncle Powell to win the race by 75%.üìÆWhat's on the Menu Today?At 9.30 pm  we will have Core Retail Sales for October  which we expect to remain at 0.8%.The retail sales figure will also be released  and we expect an improvement of 1.1%  up from 0.7% in the prior period.It is Nov 16  Tuesday  at 7.45 am in Singapore and 7.45 pm in New York. It might yet be another volatile week  and we hope all friends of Pika World have a safe ride ahead!",btohqsg
