Noted  as long as get af waiver ðŸ‘Œ,btohqsg
Quick question: for someone who has letâ€™s say 50k and a salary of 4k/month  why would he choose to put his 50k in highest fixed deposit (~4.1%) instead of SC bonus saver account (say He fulfils 3/5 conditions) @~4.88% ?Just wanted to hear your feedback,btohqsg
FD interest is fixed. Bank interest rates can vary.Maybe lazy to fulfill conditions,btohqsg
So you mean when they announce 7.88% for all conditions fullfiled  it might only be for a few months? And not even for a year?,btohqsg
yes. actually sc not so good  spend on bonussaver card no rebate,btohqsg
Whats the average time they keep to their announced promo rate? Based on your experienceâ€¦,btohqsg
Ezlink and a few others like mc do isnâ€™t it?,btohqsg
bonussaver need to spend on bonussaver card that does not give rebate only count to meet requirements for bonus interest,btohqsg
Min is $500 spend / monthâ€¦ quite easy to reachâ€¦$2000 im not sure,btohqsg
for the bonus interest promo for 4.5%-4.7% for feb-jun  only based on reference month Jan.,btohqsg
So if Jan only $1000 in HSBC  then feb onwards there's 50k  the incremental bonus interest is applied on the 49k?,btohqsg
Any Tuas power electricity customer here?,btohqsg
Yeah hence why people go with SSB or t bill cause it guaranteed while this saving account is as long as they give could be next month they drop the rate if bank interest rate drop,btohqsg
may I know what are Tuas volts used for?,btohqsg
It depends on macroeconomic conditions. If this week suddenly Fed announce U Turn and going to cut interest rates  then bank rates will shortly follow. If status quo then the interest rate can maintain v long one,btohqsg
Just want to know if I work overseas but want to apply Singapore credit card. Is it possible?,btohqsg
I tried it before for DBS and it is possible. But need to have an account with DBS.,btohqsg
I did it by applying online through ibanking,btohqsg
If you are Singaporean  just apply with MyInfo,btohqsg
actually if u using credit cards overseas  why apply singapore card instead of applying their local cards?,btohqsg
Actually I want to use it in Singapore when I come back for holidays,btohqsg
The main issue is the income requirement which if you work overseas for some time will appear as 0. So most banks will decline. But perhaps if you have a sizeable amount of cash in your bank account it could be approved.,btohqsg
The second option most likely put $10-20k into FD to get a secured version,btohqsg
I assume oversea income statement wonâ€™t be recognise by Singapore bank,btohqsg
Depends which country u pay your income tax I guess.,btohqsg
Hi  just want to check for OCBC CNY Fixed Deposit Promotion  the money has to be originated from fresh fund right? Is it possible for me to transfer my money from OCBC to other bank accounts first  then within 1-2 days apply for the fixed deposit using those funds?,btohqsg

I signed up Citi reward card via moneysmart.My Q : can i topup youtrip 500sgd and able to get the gift?,btohqsg
T&C from moneysmart indicate check citi reward  but citi reward did not mentioned no topup  only MCC for 4x miles,btohqsg
the T&C says its only for retail transaction. Usually topup MCC will not qualify,btohqsg
Guys  what's the credit card charges if we use one time payment for retail expenses?,btohqsg
Just curious why GE? I don't have private insurance since I don't believe in double paying (we all pay for medishield life already),btohqsg
Medishield no pre and post hospitalisation claim i think?,btohqsg
Nope but not worth it for how much you pay for private insurance. Unless you every year hospitalised,btohqsg
If you have the financial bandwidth  I personally feel that you should consider upgrading all shield plans (medishield & careshield / eldershield) with private insurers to increase your coverage. The basic gov shield plans are pretty basic  premiums are generally afforable and part (if not all) of the premiums can be paid using MA.,btohqsg
MOH has a comparison page to compare all the integrated Medshield plans :https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medishield-life/comparison-of-integrated-shield-plans,btohqsg
Sorry quick question:Will Gpay+Amaze+CRMC be eligible for 4mpd (assuming not for travel - 7-11  etc)?,btohqsg
Not I can't afford it. I don't want to double pay. If medishield were optional then I would consider opting for a better private insurance. By principal I dislike double paying. No as if I don't claim medishield or healthcare insurance I will get in premium rebate,btohqsg
And it limits ur options also  unless u willing to pay when immediate medical attention is needed. Imagine ur family doctor finds some issues with ur daughter n ask her to get tested asap  r u okay to tell ur daughter to wait a few months for slot at public hospital?,btohqsg
Besides my workplace also have hospitalisation insurance so that would be triple coverage,btohqsg
An intergrated shield plan complements the basic medishield plan.. it does not double count. This screenshot show what the basic medishield covers... it is sorely lacking.,btohqsg
Medical emergencies don't work that way. I used to work in a hospital so you cant use your whatifs to scare me.,btohqsg
Beside I know restructured hospitals have better equipment,btohqsg
