is it a coincidence or did we pick up ya from europe,btohqsg
cause yankies use ya like “ what are ya doing”,btohqsg
I just watched a Minecraft video with sideways gravity and my brain like,btohqsg
Now sees the actual world sideways,btohqsg
means i get paid for free doing nth at all,btohqsg
But difference is you get paid $2000 per month  I get recruit pay,btohqsg
Why do you have the mp3 of it,btohqsg
Difference is you get more pay than I do as an LCP before the increase,btohqsg
Of which $20 is gone for the now useless HomeTeam NS membership,btohqsg
Cornavirus: Record 386 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore; 65-year-old Singaporean man becomes 9th person to die from virushttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/cornavirus-record-386-new-covid-19-cases-in-spore-65-year-old-singaporean-man-becomes-9th?xtor=CS3-18&utm_source=STiPhone&utm_medium=share&utm_term=2020-04-13%2023%3A04%3A01,btohqsg
True  but promotion for us is easier,btohqsg
guys what if martial law happens,btohqsg
we about to reach 3k followers on the covid account,btohqsg
Even USA haven't reach martial law  I doubt we will,btohqsg
holy shit i’m just listening to the donki song,btohqsg
if everyone is infected our infection rate will be 0,btohqsg
Isn't that what some countries are doing,btohqsg
cant get increase in cases if everyone is a case,btohqsg
But in case martial law happens  does SPF have any power?,btohqsg
Basically we don't need to go SCS for sergeant,btohqsg
SPF technically isn’t military I guess,btohqsg
can’t get covid if you are already deceased,btohqsg
I don't get why you're saying this,btohqsg
Originally you say you get $2k less than someone,btohqsg
Police probably still had the general powers,btohqsg
But the saf will probably be the ones doing the patrol,btohqsg
Confusing then  he gets paid more than me cuz he's civilian,btohqsg
MP will need prepare DB for people who get arrested,btohqsg
you know what they do in philippines to get people to abide with the lockdown,btohqsg
they unleash ghosts into the streets,btohqsg
I wonder if there’s enough DB space for the whole SG,btohqsg
so we should open hell’s gate earlier this year,btohqsg
damn the mafia not be playin man,btohqsg
The Italian mafia helping out more than Trump's administration,btohqsg

Someone seems to be enjoying their netflix,btohqsg

Help la  O-level question anyhowly state area.,btohqsg
The area of the triangle is definitely not 27 cm^2 or whatever given the measurements as provided,btohqsg
Pls fact-check O-level questions with me,btohqsg
That O-level math is also a scam,btohqsg
I bet $100 that it either extends or doesn’t,btohqsg
I bet your money that 27 is not equal to 36.4927496224.,btohqsg
I bet the same amount but twice that you are right,btohqsg
There's a third choice  Singapore fucking explodes,btohqsg
I have the n word pass from my black friend,btohqsg
In that case the CB doesn’t extend,btohqsg
That would mean the Govt is no longer in power,btohqsg
And if the Govt is not in power  CB is no longer in effect,btohqsg
