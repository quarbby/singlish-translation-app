St Hilda‚Äôs Primary School pupil Ng Ying Chen said he was on his way to school when he got caught in a traffic jam.‚ÄúA journey that usually takes 10 minutes became 30 minutes  and we had to detour because the road was inaccessible due to several vehicles blocking the road ‚Äù the 10-year-old said.ü§îü§îü§î,btohqsg
i think the one that overtuned was the TMJC student and her father üò¢,btohqsg
My goodbye to her was my last.Temasek JC student Afifah Munirah Muhammad Azril  who died in a 6-vehicle accident in Tampines  was bright and friendly  say friends and neighbours.https://str.sg/zoSJ,btohqsg
If only the run at TP wasn‚Äôt on that day  or TJC delayed the prime upgrading by another year‚Ä¶,btohqsg
If by any chance the driver survives he should be banned from driving for life,btohqsg
was on the way to take part in the annual TJC Road Run when the accident occurred. The students had assembled at Temasek Polytechnic before heading to Bedok Reservoir for the run.,btohqsg
Isn't the driver already undergoing investigation already?,btohqsg
Yeah that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs too unfortunate. If TP run was another day or TJC didn‚Äôt relocate earlier and they likely would‚Äôve chosen another place for the event  this wouldn‚Äôt have happened. It‚Äôs rly just a misfortune of things happening at the wrong place and the wrong time,btohqsg
ST A 42-year-old female car driver and a 39-year-old man  who was also a passenger in the van  sought medical attention on their own at a hospital later.The 42-year-old male car driver is assisting with police investigations.,btohqsg
Wtf how were they not arrested on site,btohqsg
But also I read up on the penalties for reckless driving resulting in death. I think they‚Äôre too lenient,btohqsg
Where death is caused to another person due to dangerous or reckless drivingForfirst-time offenders:under section 64(2)  the penalty is imprisonment for not less than 2 years and not more than 8 years.Disqualification from holding a driver‚Äôs licence for at least 10 years.Forrepeat offenders  a minimum of 4 years imprisonment and not more than 15 years.Disqualification from holding a driver‚Äôs licence for at least 10 years.If the offender is aserious offender  the relevant sentence for non-serious first-time offenders and  in addition:A minimum of 1 year imprisonment and not more than 2 years; andDisqualification from holding a driver‚Äôs licence for at least 12 years.Where the offender is aserious repeat offenderin relation to the driving  in addition to the prescribed punishment for non-serious repeat offenders:A minimum of 2 years imprisonment up to a maximum of 4 years imprisonment.If the offender has only one previous conviction for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol  disqualification from holding a driver‚Äôs licence for at least 15 years.If the offender has 2 or more previous convictions  they can be disqualified for life.As we can see  the Act prescribes minimum and maximum penalties. When considering what sentence to impose  the court will also consider the driver‚Äôs actions and attitude  also referred to as the driver‚Äôs culpability.,btohqsg
There should be a lifetime ban on driving,btohqsg
Unless if there‚Äôs another car with Tampines meridian student,btohqsg
Umm no? Tmjc is Tampines meridian,btohqsg
tp is the old tamp jc,btohqsg
Someone mentioned the max he could get is 10 years  the worse case to date I rmb got 5 yrs,btohqsg
the others cars are all primary school students,btohqsg
Ok then because I was confused why you said tm,btohqsg
Since it‚Äôs a low value item I doubt the judges will impose the maximum sentence,btohqsg
same for reckless driving resulting in death?,btohqsg
Every case is different and the judges should have the discretion on what sentence to impose based on the law,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm no lawyer so can‚Äôt comment too much,btohqsg
did u just compare stealing from a temple with reckless endangerment,btohqsg
specifically reckless driving resulting in death,btohqsg
Theft maybe one year and the above reckless driving also get one year,btohqsg
There was that one guy convicted of drug driving after killing a family of 4 otw to send off at the airport. He got 5 yrs  the worst I've seen in terms of driver vs road fatality,btohqsg
He took drugs? Or drunk driving,btohqsg
Also it was mentioned here the ppl who got flung out of the car were not wearing seatbelts. I wonder if in the case of the Tampines incident  the person(s) (forgot if there‚Äôs 1 or 2) weren‚Äôt wearing,btohqsg
Nope cte fatal accident all 4 died,btohqsg
Just read the other msgs you‚Äôll understand the confusion,btohqsg
He was saying tmjc instead of tjc,btohqsg
is there any geog student here that is not valerie,btohqsg
If you talking about current students only,btohqsg
I need clarify one part of the syllabus,btohqsg
Idk why cpdd always makes the syllabus doc confusing,btohqsg
Wait Valerie do u have the waste as a potential resource thingy,btohqsg
hi does any1 take h1 geog i need help,btohqsg
Oh she asked me for help last time,btohqsg
Ohya I also got somewhat help,btohqsg
You need to find h2 geog students ah,btohqsg
THE DEMAND PLACED ON NATURAL ENVIROENT,btohqsg
demand placed on natural environment when waste is not viewed as a potential resource,btohqsg
idk xuz my cher say 3 body paragraphs den need like 2 case studies,btohqsg
like one positive and one negative,btohqsg
so long as I dont see waste as something useful = i will harm the environment,btohqsg
a h1 essay is only 13m,btohqsg
they said u should do that,btohqsg
one gp essay has about 12 examples,btohqsg
a gp essay has 30m of content,btohqsg
can u send me ur sch notes for that portion,btohqsg
the demand placed on the environment,btohqsg
EJ h1 MYE is GI + Urban,btohqsg
Ya its better than having nth,btohqsg
Are they saying something like they dump the waste in the environment,btohqsg
EJ for some reason refuses to send me their 3.1 notes,btohqsg
do uw me to talk abt the societal perception,btohqsg
"because the way its phrased is like a societal perception (inherent in the phrase ""potential resource"")",btohqsg
I thought with your connections your chers should have no qualms,btohqsg
but in the grand scheme of things it seems like the tangible phenomenon,btohqsg
I wanted to ask my Econs Cher for notes but she said she can‚Äôt send to ex students,btohqsg
Nvm I too dumb to comprehend this,btohqsg
we could use it IF we wanted to,btohqsg
but if u unpack WHY its potential,btohqsg
its mainly cause of societal perception (for waste at least),btohqsg
I mean you can go the angle of,btohqsg
countries are not financially capable of turning waste into an actual resource,btohqsg
Oh ok then the phrasing there is so weird,btohqsg
I mean the case study theyre thinking of,btohqsg
Do you want me to try my luck with mine,btohqsg
Feel like this is mentioned in my notes b4,btohqsg
Im gonna drop the ej one another text,btohqsg
How should I phrase my request ah,btohqsg
yeah cuz thats what its probably talking abtThe idea that our wastewater is seen as unusable until some genius saw it as a potential resource so turned it into like drinkable water,btohqsg
Cos I don‚Äôt even know what portion of the syllabus is that,btohqsg
cuz it may seem too random,btohqsg
Im alr pressing the EJ cher,btohqsg
at most I just tell my student to scan everything and send me,btohqsg
Maybe I‚Äôll just send the syllabus doc and circle that part,btohqsg
Ask if she can send me the notes where that part is covered,btohqsg
@whatisgrassdo yall have this part in the notesBecause of the mutually exclusive nature of sustainable development (as exemplified in the concept of trade-offs)  it raises a salient point that sustainable development can never be fully achieved ‚Üí Sustainable development has to be seen more of a process rather than an end state  no society can ever be fully sustainable  but countries can be more sustainable than others and can continue to work towards being sustainable.,btohqsg
i need see what to remove,btohqsg
Ok ya she said can‚Äôt cos of copyright reasons,btohqsg
Okay I will create my own notes,btohqsg
and it will be better than all the schools,btohqsg
I will get a 100% distinction rate for H1 Geog (I only have one student and shes already getting A),btohqsg
6 people were taken to hospital after a 6-vehicle accident on PIE last evening (Apr. 22).‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/4b7kwqeFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
Why are some people blaming the white car and the motorcycle in this video?,btohqsg
yes indeed speculation and assumptions..nobody will ever know how absurb the saab driver would have reacted had he struck or not struck the white car..but given this scenario  no matter what angle you look at it from. the chance of the saab speeding away never ever decreases,btohqsg
"The fact it never decreases means something has to have made that a definitive increase or stagnantation with the game of probability. That ""something"" was the GLC's whether intentional or not strike of the saab",btohqsg
That's why the GLC is being blamed,btohqsg
In the future you can become a full time moe geog Cher liao,btohqsg
So is that in ejc notes or that was what you wrote,btohqsg
whoever blame the motorcycle need to get their brain checked lol.,btohqsg
motorcycle too poor to afford better car. If he had better car then people wont die/s,btohqsg
i saw there was a post from the white GLC driver on SGExams but i think deleted,btohqsg
isnt that what most people think,btohqsg
thats what my parents told me ystd,btohqsg
They thought my malay friends were giving me drugs or smth,btohqsg
and thwats why i didnt go home for 3 nights,btohqsg
Oh yea btw this one was another news that came and went,btohqsg
Oh I thought that was for that portion from the new syllabus that you were confused about,btohqsg
Hopefully your other Cher gets back to you I guess,btohqsg
Like you intend to go back to teach so I don‚Äôt see why they shouldn‚Äôt send,btohqsg
"they roped me in to ""mentor a J2"" externally for free through some mentorship programme",btohqsg
but they dont give me the resources to mentor,btohqsg
I think if you complain they‚Äôll take action,btohqsg
There was a faster accident but not as quick as the Ferrari vs taxi that caused a death as well,btohqsg
I can't find it on reddit ah but this was SS from a friend's story,btohqsg
no got one damn funny thing that happened recently,btohqsg
the h1 syllabus is fking stupid,btohqsg
whats the pt of teaching students abt sustainable development,btohqsg
But not teaching SUD when thats the focus of the whole thig,btohqsg
Now i need to think should i even teach sud,btohqsg
it got taken down  dunno why the person go post on sge tho,btohqsg
cuz it would help? But its not explicitly tested,btohqsg
Most likely he tried to post on sg reddit but post was taken down,btohqsg
Ya it‚Äôs not an expressway  no need to keep left unless overtaking I think,btohqsg
If motorcycle wants to turn right or sth he can always stay on the right line,btohqsg
i got my bio wa back :(,btohqsg
idk  i saw on asksg i think? that the guy posted on sge but it got taken down cuz not related,btohqsg
I think his sister also lol,btohqsg
What was the motorcycle doing wrong,btohqsg
Car accident from ahgong Ahma era,btohqsg
But normal road if you want to turn right then how,btohqsg
Might be too late to keep right later,btohqsg
I think almost all the fault is with the black car,btohqsg
Like even without the motorcycle and white car the accident would‚Äôve stillHappened,btohqsg
That guy had no reason to speed and 5 business days to slow down after overtaking,btohqsg
Ok but I wonder at what speed was the Mercedes and motorcycle travelling at,btohqsg
I don't think anybody thinks the black car is not most at fault but many think had the white car not agitated intentionally or not towards the black car. The driver of Saab may not have ran through the intersection,btohqsg
If they‚Äôre alr near or slightly above the 60 speed limit they have no reason to keep left,btohqsg
Dude like if you‚Äôre travelling at the speed limit you can go to the fastest lane what. I think anyone who says otherwise likes to speed lol,btohqsg
maybe they like playing mario cart,btohqsg
need to swerve left and right and drift to go faster,btohqsg
then need to pick up the powerups,btohqsg
There is a rear pov of the Merc  y'all saw it?,btohqsg
Should always keep left but in this scenario the motorcycle is not in the wrong. Yes it would be better if the motorcycle kept left  but it is not wrong for him to be in the right lane since he was going at a decent speed and there was no one tailgating him. If it's a highway then yes the motorcycle should have kept to the left but it's not.,btohqsg
Oh there alr was a car behind the merc. I wonder what speed that car was travelling at though,btohqsg
The rear pov showed the Saab racing past a white Merc behind the motorcycle and swerving around the GLC. So the Saab intent was to speed on that road,btohqsg
Open up reddit yesterday saw the SGE post of a 16 year old getting pregnant and wanting a abortion,btohqsg
I‚Äôm more concerned about this car because behind the merc there‚Äôs this car on the right lane that‚Äôs travelling very slowly,btohqsg
Immediately was like yeah... that's enough reddit for today.,btohqsg
why u quote me i did not mention anything about saab/merc,btohqsg
Oh was just replying to you not that specific comment,btohqsg
There was a E class behind the motorcycle,btohqsg
If the E class is referring to the car  then it does seem like the E class was being too slow,btohqsg
The Saab sped up to cut infront of that e class,btohqsg
But I can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs the exact speed,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt find any such post on sge,btohqsg
The e class is not seen in any angles except the rest pov,btohqsg
Yep I was like wtf bruh the person was like I have 1.5k is that enough for an abortion,btohqsg
No.. and I didn't have the Alacrity to ask,btohqsg
slow  maybe 40-50. exact speed does not matter... he's not in the wrong. only that he should keep left but given its a small road it doesn't matter that much,btohqsg
From the dashcam of the Facebook video I sent I thought it was taken in the e class,btohqsg
"Has a leadership position in a ""reputable school""",btohqsg
Oh I was thinking J1 but still 16,btohqsg
And went for overseas immersion before in sec3,btohqsg
Bruh reading is like.. if it's true i don't wanna live in this world anymore if it's false this is still a fucked up world we live in where that is considered entrainment,btohqsg
Not wrong but just not very considerate I guess  if the speed limit was 60,btohqsg
The TJC girl goes to the afterlife be like Eh why u here.. oh because some retard decided their time was more important than my life,btohqsg
And with the red light  not like speeding would‚Äôve made a difference,btohqsg
You travel at 60 also still have to stop,btohqsg
The idea is that u speed up enough u cross the line at amber still can,btohqsg
But that's still a fucking stupid proposition,btohqsg
The dashcam videos showed that there were alr cars in front who stopped  so I think the red light was on for a while,btohqsg
Also if he did not speed he could‚Äôve easily stopped,btohqsg
That white car is the e class I'm talking about  this dashcam is from the glc,btohqsg
Isn't it the black car that went thru the traffic,btohqsg
Ya idk why that white car stay on the right lane,btohqsg
u shud just let people do what they want to do,btohqsg
The car directly behind is the Saab speeding up to cut into the lane of that Merc,btohqsg
Motorcyclist was probably travelling at around 60 so it‚Äôs fine,btohqsg
The thing is they wanna do it without parental consent.,btohqsg
Think it is.. for like polyclinic need consent one,btohqsg
Then she should just own up to her parents she fked up,btohqsg
Only when u hit 18 then u can sign the form,btohqsg
i think i had a friend who self aborted,btohqsg
lemme go ask her how she did that,btohqsg
Yup it was  closed the distance between it and the e class very quickly,btohqsg
That would be kind of awkward unless your friend knows,btohqsg
I'm uploading the rear dashcam vid right now,btohqsg
Bruh I have more questions with that lmao,btohqsg
But I mean if the MC is given by the doctor it doesn‚Äôt matter what‚Äôs the reason given for RS,btohqsg
That basically means you are allowed to see the doctor late?,btohqsg
Instead of within 2h of reporting time,btohqsg
Technically u go polyclinic at anytime u can just get mc within 1 hour,btohqsg
wha the does is he say he morning RSO,btohqsg
then come to camp in the afternoon,btohqsg
If I use manadr my office confirm will know I‚Äôm kenging,btohqsg
say he felt better so he decided not to RSO,btohqsg
yea same  i was like wth,btohqsg
Then what about the wake up late part,btohqsg
"""I got alot of work to do then iw finish""",btohqsg
then let him go home early,btohqsg
Isn't that for repeat visits one?,btohqsg
Miss the covid days u say throat pain auto 3 day,btohqsg
If u ask nicely 5 day,btohqsg
cuz ur superior ask u go home,btohqsg
then cannot AM AWOL also cause u got intention to RSO,btohqsg
I only go the singhealth ones,btohqsg
oh mine will ask us coem back,btohqsg
but what time we come bakc he drc,btohqsg
as long as we are back for LP,btohqsg
@LZW_123that saab was closing extremely fast very likely alr hitting 70-80 overtaking,btohqsg
No he literally tells us stuff like,btohqsg
speed past the first white car then contact with second white car,btohqsg

As a mark of respect for Afifah Munirah bte Muhd Azril (CG19/24)  TJC‚Äôs social media went silent yesterday  as staff and students mourned her passing.Afifah‚Äôs friends and teachers hold her dearly as a well-loved young lady who was lively and exuded loads of positive energy. Her Civics Tutors Ms Anna Maria and Ms Premala Krishnadas as well as her Mathematics Tutor Mr Leonard Lau Fook Choy said that she took her studies seriously and was a self-motivated student who contributed actively in tutorials.Her Biology and Students‚Äô Council tutor Ms Jean Chong had this to say: ‚ÄúAfifah always had a way to light up the classroom  even in the most dreary of afternoons.

i thought in some way of a other  they are interrelated de?,btohqsg
to type quickly is just to be technically proficient,btohqsg
to be a good writer is to be a creative,btohqsg
something that monkeytype/typing tests dont provide,btohqsg
