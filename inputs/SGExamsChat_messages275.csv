My brain too overwhelmed with all these,btohqsg
i'm already borderline failing chem without o chem but yes i'm overjoyed,btohqsg
i'm waiting on the release of chinese results to know whether i should work on my chem more HAHAHA,btohqsg
bc l1r4 so i choose which subjects i wanna focus on,btohqsg
YEAH my tuition kinda covered it but hahaha,btohqsg
if my chinese is decent then...chemistry focus goes down a lil,btohqsg
Because it‚Äôs out of O levels  so if you‚Äôre overwhelmed  means you‚Äôre not sec 4 student,btohqsg
Just revise and try your best,btohqsg
my parents were too lax with me i think,btohqsg
ok cannot blame them they wanted me to study myself,btohqsg
nah they just briefly go through,btohqsg
You have other subjects that you are better at?,btohqsg
Yeah  they are giving you independence,btohqsg

I couldn't watch so I kept getting updates from my F1 group,btohqsg
lost my mind even more when ham got on podium,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not complaining though apart from leclerc,btohqsg
I'm a major Lec/Alo guy so when Alonso went and screwed with Hamilton I lost my shit.,btohqsg
the ham nerf is actually just alo,btohqsg
Hamilton like taking RBR out so much they decided to qurantine him,btohqsg
Me after all my friends flake on me lmfao,btohqsg
I feel like Williams was more excited for points than Alpine was for the win,btohqsg
Alpine garage felt so muted lol,btohqsg
Tru  I mean they've been struggling for quite a while now.,btohqsg
Alo defended like pole was the last pizza slice,btohqsg
Also I can‚Äôt wait for Belgium Lap 1 turn 1 max takes out ham and Bottas,btohqsg
Alonso 40 but still has it in him,btohqsg
and with ham blessedness  ver will take himself out too,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why he at the back during quali,btohqsg
He want to be at the back so he dont get hit by bulldozing yuki,btohqsg
I had so much hope for Yuki at the beginning of the year lmao,btohqsg
He's young ig  he'll mellow out eventually,btohqsg
Mick's engineer is so sweet tho,btohqsg
I might just get the F1 TV for Yuki team radio,btohqsg

You are only considered fully vaccinated 2 weeks after second dose,btohqsg
Nah bro  you have to walk in at exactly 12 midnight,btohqsg
Other than that  hawker centres and coffeeshops limit of 2 regardless of vaccination status,btohqsg
Coffeeshops and hawker centres: Limit of 2 regardless of vaccination statusOther F&B places: Limit of 5 for fully vaccinated  not allowed for those not fully vax,btohqsg
so means food court can have 5 ppl right,btohqsg
idk eh i tot food court more strict,btohqsg
Food courts don't fall under coffeeshops or hawker centres,btohqsg
There's a 23 page advisory for F&B if you all want to read lol:https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/media-centre/media-releases/2021/august/mr05521_updated-advisory-for-safe-management-measures-at-food--beverage-establishments.pdf?la=en,btohqsg

Help us debug . All u have to do is write out a bunch of molecules and see if there are any obvious errors in printing. Eg carbon with 5 bonds or benzene with more than usual hydrogens,btohqsg
Alternatively if there are any better  simpler ways to do things just create an issue,btohqsg
"Haha I don't act do/unds chem sadly ;""(",btohqsg
but I can try to help in the debugging if needed,btohqsg
which is why u can contribute by optimising the code instead maybe hahaha,btohqsg
Is this counted as brisk walking?8 km under 45mins,btohqsg
I walked from XX mrt to XX lrt,btohqsg
route march pace is brisk walking pace and it's 4km every 45-1hr,btohqsg
And my friend is complaining I'm walking too fast,btohqsg
And he is having the luxury to sit the bus rn,btohqsg
yeah 8km in 45 min is defo jogging pace  it's 2.4km in 13.5 min,btohqsg
I mean my 2.4km is under 10mins alr,btohqsg
need to cut 2 mins from that and max out statics then ippt gold,btohqsg
i get silver i happy alr,btohqsg
If you think finishing 8km in 45 min is jogging,btohqsg
my fastest 2.4 10min flat leh that's almost sprinting the entire route,btohqsg
Nice  you‚Äôre like the A+ in running in sg,btohqsg

I walk at least 5km everyday-?,btohqsg

Aren't there already software like this?,btohqsg
If u ask me why I didn't take the bus,btohqsg
that's me going to my work place,btohqsg
i tired of the traffic so i bought a bike to cycle instead,btohqsg
it will pay itself off in like 2 years assuming i go to work everyday (which i don't now cause wfh),btohqsg
sg weather no go though  need to bring spare change,btohqsg
cause the route is on a slight incline  confirm will sweat,btohqsg
yea not when you're sweating into your work clothes,btohqsg
no one wants to sweat during commutes,btohqsg
But u can bring extra clothes,btohqsg
Well I bring 2 sets of clothes to sch,btohqsg
But but it's windy in the afternoon,btohqsg
it's more like why bring when you no need bring,btohqsg
yea i don't regret choosing to cycle to work but it does come with its downsides lor,btohqsg
And cuz the weather aso unpredictable,btohqsg
anyway i can also go recreational cycling with my friends so even more win,btohqsg

Esp when rider doesnt make intentions to turn known,btohqsg
