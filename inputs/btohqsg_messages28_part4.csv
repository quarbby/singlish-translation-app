Number of applicants vs the number of flats available,btohqsg
589 applicants / 546 units for 2R,btohqsg
Thats encouraging right for ppl whp applied there,btohqsg
Obviously those who dont get it should buy 4D because they beat the odds,btohqsg
If u consider a 10% dropout rate  then just about everybody will get a unit,btohqsg
Remember those number also include type 1,btohqsg
Yes type 1 and type 2,btohqsg
Now cannot anyhow drop out unless get ban for 1 year,btohqsg
Why do u think hdb issue q number for beyond supply?,btohqsg
In the event if there are drop outs,btohqsg
Drop outs + in case some ethnic quotas finish,btohqsg
From an applicant who wrote in to HDB regarding results release,btohqsg
Hi all  it's 3rd or 4th week of Dec.,btohqsg
Yes ah cause there‚Äôs still questions,btohqsg
This is the closest to from HDBs mouth,btohqsg
I got no rights to pin,btohqsg
Plus if it‚Äôs in a different topic then cannot ^ it,btohqsg
All the best to all applicants! Hope you get a good good queue no. üôèüèªChaptGPT was one day off from its predictions ü§≠üòÜ,btohqsg
Wish good luck for 2nd timer,btohqsg
Hi guys for those with expired hfe but successful ballot number  we don‚Äôt need to reapply right?,btohqsg
Whats the queue number they will give until if the units offered is about 1200,btohqsg
Any idea what are the potential locations for Feb 2025‚Äôs SBF?,btohqsg
Hi  I got a Bto queue number 16xx but it is out of supply.1) with this  can I apply sbf in next cycle (Feb 2025)?2) my current hfe is expiring next year but I want to reassess my current grant and loan. can I cancel my hfe letter and reapply again? Would I be considered second timer?,btohqsg
Any group for Pasir Ris BTO Costa Reviera,btohqsg
If out of supply can apply for Feb‚Äôs round. But if get called up in the end to choose for this BTO you‚Äôll need to go for it (unless out of ethnic quota or only left 10 units),btohqsg
1. If your no. Is out of supply  you can apply for the next launch.2. If you need to reassess your grant and loan  yes you need to cancel and reapply hfe. No  you're not considered 2nd timer.2nd timer is considered when you receive a queue within supply but choose to reject the unit offered  unless the unit is less than 10 or exceeded ethnic quota. The non-selection count is waived if you have 10 or fewer BTO flats to choose from at your flat selection appointment if you're being called up.,btohqsg
Oh yes then you should apply for feb,btohqsg
But I am allowed to cancel and reapply for a new hfe letter hor? Even when my current hfe letter not expiring?,btohqsg
I think for reassessment you can write into HDB. Don‚Äôt need to cancel ba,btohqsg
When‚Äôs it expiring? Maybe can renew when nearer expiration,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt allow me to reassess  I want to reapply again so it can go through the bot one based on CPF not human assessment‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I wrote in earlier to HDB cos my HFE was expiring in early Feb  but the deadline to apply for HFE for Feb‚Äôs launch was by 15 Dec. My HFE then might not be able to wait till Feb‚Äôs launch.HDB then ended my HFE which was expiring in Feb  to Dec (earlier expiry) upon my request after clarification which allowed me to re-apply for a HFE!Can try writing in to HDB :) they replied me within a working day!,btohqsg
I just graduated this year July and now working full time. So in my case  my first application for hfe automatically went through bot assessment  it counted my internship allowance into the grant assessment. So I got a high grant low loan.But during that period interest rate very high mah  so I call up hdb to reassess. Then they say internship shld not be taken into consideration so they adjust it to a lower grant higher loan.But now bank interest rate drops already  so I want back the first option. But hdb doesn‚Äôt allow it  so I am trying to reapply again to get the bot assessment..,btohqsg
Hmm if reapply won‚Äôt be able to make it for Feb‚Äôs application le.,btohqsg
Even reapply won‚Äôt guarantee will give you back first assessment kind of results since most likely already got your records,btohqsg
Cuz my first time the results come back on the 2nd day during weekend. That‚Äôs why I know it a bot assessment haha,btohqsg
Cuz I got a low loan amount from hdb mah and this amount won‚Äôt change until key collection  but for bank loan  I can reassess again near key collection date.,btohqsg
So in this case  the only motivation for me to take hdb loan during that period earlier this year is due to the lower interest rate for hdb loan,btohqsg
any idea if out of supply for oct 2024 can still apply for feb 2025 bto ?,btohqsg
If out of supply can apply for Feb‚Äôs round. But if get called up in the end to choose for this BTO you‚Äôll need to go for it (unless out of ethnic quota or only left 10 units),btohqsg
"Hi  has anyone re-apply for HFE? I click on ""view letter/ re-apply HFE letter"" but the next page loaded doesn't show anything about re-apply HFE.",btohqsg
Abit too early. You can't re apply yet. Maybe you wait until early Jan,btohqsg
Usually is abt 1 month before expired you can re apply,btohqsg
Another separate question  is there any way we can increase the HDB housing loan? If there‚Äôs an increase in salary  does it mean higher loan?,btohqsg
Can I check the method you used to contact HDB? Someone was trying to use my request and couldn‚Äôt find a suitable option to click,btohqsg
Under HFE  no reassessment of loan is the official stance,btohqsg
Oh! Do you know which option to click below? As there‚Äôs no ‚ÄúHFE flat eligibility‚Äù option only,btohqsg
hi just to check  do i need to provide rom cert on choosing flat phase or can i provide during key collecting?,btohqsg
Within 3 months of key collection,btohqsg
I think we chose either the 1st or 2nd one!,btohqsg
