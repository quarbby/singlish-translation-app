Physical card yes.But you won’t be able to add it to Apple Pay and pay via your phone.Im not sure abt Android,btohqsg
Are you their customer previously?If yes  are you a good customer as in you always pay on time?What happen to me is that i used to hold their Citibank credit cards and I always late on payment (first credit card and very busy with work)  sometimes my bill is $1xx but i also forget to pay. Eventually i cancel the card after paying the late charges multiple times. That was 4 years agoThen recently  I tried applying for the card and they rejected me instantly. Literally reject me instantly once i applied for the card. I tried calling Citibank but they cannot give me answer also.,btohqsg
I never had a card with them and I hsbc is my only ever credit card and I paid all in full and on time,btohqsg
https://www.americanexpress.com/content/dam/amex/sg/benefits/SGexclusions_Aug2022.pdfMeaning Amex-KF Ascend card cannot use to pay for hospital bills already ?,btohqsg

Citi rewards Mastercard:2 questions🙏:- is the $1000 cap applied to all categories? Shared among Online/amazecategories  grab  grabfood  online groceries  etc OR each of these are $1k cap?- if it’s each above  does it mean it makes sense to not link CRMC>Amaze>Grab  but directly to CRMC>Grab  to not hit the cap?,btohqsg
it's a fixed S$1000 cap for all eligible categories per statement month,btohqsg
Stack with ShopBack DBS Guarantee $150 cashback  make sure to link and pay with DBS cards  10x transactions  min amount per transaction also $20.,btohqsg
Citi PremierMiles : for insurance payment  has it to be monthly payment type to earn the miles?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  can check does buying FWD travel insurance eligible for 4mpd for Citibank Rewards Cards? Thanks,btohqsg
What's the benefits of Citi payall,btohqsg
This earns base rate only so 0.4mpd if CRMC,btohqsg
Must be monthly payment type? To earn the max miles?My insurance mostly annual type,btohqsg
Allow you to earn miles on insurance  utilities and rental for a nominal fees,btohqsg
Dun need monthly payment type if use payall,btohqsg
Like that have to use grab card liao,btohqsg
Does anyone know LatitudePay have to link to what credit card to use BNPL at Harvey Norman?,btohqsg
the 150 dollars is for dbs new cardholders? which participanting stall in capitamall is advisable?,btohqsg
shanelook for the card promotion banner under ongoing campaigns for more details. It’s for anyone who holds any DBS/POSB Credit and Debit cards that’s linked to ShopBack. Remember to enrol into the CapitaStar/ShopBack campaign. Just use ShopBack pay and you can stack the 2 campaigns.It has to be 10 different stores/shops/restaurants for the DBS $150,btohqsg
Hmm  personally I spend it mostly on food and snacks like famous Amos  eureka popcorns  bears  12 cupcakes  etc and meals in restaurants that I can get just nice $20 or slightly more. In that way  I can maximise the cashback 😂 so it’s really up to you to plan and decide what do you like and get the max out of it 😊,btohqsg
I have been using UOB one until now  but after seeing your citi miles reward strategy I am wondering if citi is the card to go with.  Also  will I get 4 MPD for the education bills?,btohqsg
Citi PremierMiles : telco bills will not earn miles right?,btohqsg
ok i see...thanks for the info. can i know the 10 different stores need to be those who accept shopback pay?,btohqsg
the 10 purchases need not to be fulfilled all in 1 days right?,btohqsg
Yes  you just have search in ShopBack app for the nearby shops in the area or malls that you’re going to.,btohqsg
No  for the DBS campaign  you gave up to 31st Oct,btohqsg
I meant citi miles reward + amaze stratergy,btohqsg
At the 5th transaction  you will get $10 scratch card.At the 8th transaction  you will get $35 scratch card.At the 10th transaction  you will get $100 scratch card.So in total $150Remember to check your rewards tab for the scratch card and scratch it immediately. Otherwise  it goes away in 48 hours,btohqsg
If direct no. But if via payall yes,btohqsg
I see! The service fee for PayAll is 2% correct? 2% for each payment?,btohqsg
the 10 different stores / shops part... if i go different malls but same brand shop example Uniqlo.. will it be eligible or must all 10 shop brands be different,btohqsg
Just did f&b grab QR hmm  zero. Point,btohqsg
Has anyone here gotten anything good from Grab after the nerf lol?,btohqsg
Grab rrsdslly Nerf until cmi.But gtabb taxi's still got point,btohqsg
why direct no? telco not excluded right?,btohqsg
From amaze + citi rewards miles?,btohqsg
yes  mcc excluded even via Amaze. Amaze dun change the MCC.,btohqsg
Got it.Just a follow upOn an average I spend about 2-2.5 kOn mostly local spend.Is citi + amaze  better than uob one for me?,btohqsg
citi+amaze cap at $1000. depends what u spend on e.g. got bonus rebate from uob one? excluded mcc?,btohqsg
Nearly no exclusion on uob one,btohqsg
Is it? I pay my Gomo with citi premier miles card and i got no points,btohqsg
hm uob one quite a lot of exclusions  just a bit lax for some,btohqsg
Is it.... let me double check  which are the common ones?,btohqsg
long list. Not excluded utilities... think that's about it for more lax mcc.,btohqsg
Anyone tried m1 bill payment with Evol card through their app?,btohqsg
Must be different brand too according to the campaign conditions,btohqsg
Oh then will be slightly tougher,btohqsg
Yes  so it requires a bit of planning and calculations 😂 I did it once in September so this month it’s easier. If the campaign is still running next month in November then the 10 unique brands requirement will reset.,btohqsg
if can same brand but must be different malls still not that bad lolif all must be totally unique 10 different brands irregardless malls then not so simple.. only left 2 weeks,btohqsg
but if stack with capita  total $200 spend can be essentially free liao considering capita side gives a total of $50+/- overall also at least hopefully lol,btohqsg
Zero for me paid $6.2 hahahaha,btohqsg
That’s true also but still doable. Just that this month if want to stack with CapitaLand campaign then have to consider all within CapitaMallLast month I did it with Orchard Road campaign stack with DBS $150 and Capita Malls so mostly inPlaza Singapura12 cupcakesFufu PotAkimitsuBearsFamous Amosllao llaoThis month pretty much the same but I included belowJurong East WestGateMun ZukHaagen DazsGo with friends and family  can easily hit plus can spend time with good returns,btohqsg
Does dbs wwmc give 4mpd for m1 broadband payment?,btohqsg

Hi guys  I am using Citi Cashback+  want to check how can I pay for qr code payment at food stalls to be eligible for the 1.6% cashback ?2) if I sign dbs fresh live card  is there anyway to earn cashback for qr code payment ? As they only have contactless/mobile at 5% cb and 0.3% for other category,btohqsg
Usually I just top up to grab wallet and use grabpay   but since grabpay now nerfed  looking for an alternative,btohqsg
Other bank app need u have a bank acc with $$ inside,btohqsg
Example SCB got SGQr but need a bank account,btohqsg
Which app do u use for amex ?,btohqsg
Dotj see Citi on SGQr often,btohqsg
Amex pay inside amex app got a function,btohqsg
Not often I see Citi logo on SGQR,btohqsg
But does this means need Citibank acc or just their credit card will do?,btohqsg
U can try see if your Citi app got a way to scan QR,btohqsg
Got   but not sure if it will use my Citi Cashback+ card,btohqsg
U can try scab the QR but don't enter amount,btohqsg
Try this QR it stated Citi logo,btohqsg
Ok. Next time I will try . So normally for this u will use your amex for the 1.7% cb?,btohqsg
Previous I use grab now Nerf so. Switch to Amex,btohqsg
If amex nerd I willl go else,btohqsg
Unless they don't accept amex pay then u use grabpay ?,btohqsg
1) only if there is third party payment app like favepay  liquid pay or shopback pay and u linked the citiback cashback+ card to the third party app. Actually can use other cards to get more than 1.6%.2) think live fresh can get 5% under online if linked to shopback pay or liquid pay  but favepay excluded.,btohqsg
Hi guys  May I know what is the best cards for recurring monthly gym membership fees? (Fitness first)Miles preferably. Tia,btohqsg
Mine plan now isSince grab NerfSGQr I will use Amex payOther payment like Paywave I will amex until I take up others card,btohqsg
1)Which card do u recommend for qr payment to earn more than 1.6%?2)  so by using liquid pay it will change the qr transaction to online payment ?,btohqsg
Because I am planning to get DBS fresh/UOB evol(online and mobile contactless)+ Amex/grab (for insurance n bills and other big ticket items)So I am thinking how to get cashback for those sgqr and paynow qr haha,btohqsg
I think I can link dbs fresh live to paylah and use it from there,btohqsg
But I think it will be consider as otherspending (0.3% cb),btohqsg
Oh dbs pay Lah can link to credit card?,btohqsg
And deduct ffom credit card ? Think points willl be gimped,btohqsg
U also got similar situation as Mine,btohqsg
Eh I think can't . Still checking,btohqsg
Maybe can use liquid pay  but not sure how the cashback works for that one,btohqsg
Iiquid pay the redeem stuff saw review say it's cmi or got issues,btohqsg
Guess is not as established as grabGrab redemption quite smooth,btohqsg
But will get cashback on the card itself? If I use eg dbsfresh ?,btohqsg
I used to pay ntuc insurance no point before nerf using grabU can get point neh,btohqsg
it is just a conduit to get card benefits for linked cards  no need care about what redemption,btohqsg
Can't but u can get cashback from topping up grab using amex card,btohqsg
Citi PayAll : how's the service fee calculated? By per payment? How many % ?,btohqsg
fave/shopback/liquid pay converts to online  can get rewards for online cards; except DBS excludes favepay,btohqsg
U mean DBS exclude fave for eligible cashback ?,btohqsg
If just a conduit u can still use grab,btohqsg
Yup grab still can earn Cashback from amexNow only amex and uob amex can get Cashback ffom top up to grab wallet,btohqsg
https://www.americanexpress.com/sg/benefits/service-security/ways-to-pay/digital-wallets/amex-pay/faq.htmlCorrection non amex issues card can't user amex pay,btohqsg
Oops so long message hahahaha sorry,btohqsg
uh but only 1.5%/1.7%  should use other cards for more benefits,btohqsg
Paywave more common can pick other cards,btohqsg
Meaning if I use dbsfresh to link to liquid pay   those qr payment will be counted as online payment ? Therefore 5% cb?,btohqsg
sGQR usual small amounts lor like hawkers small f&b stalls,btohqsg
I think any card that link to it  similar to amaze ?,btohqsg
Count as what mcc this liquor pay hahahaha,btohqsg
uh answering Vincent query wrt QR  small shops may have QR and not paywave,btohqsg
Yes  concern mostly is about qr . Paywave is quite straight forward  can get 5% as mobile contactless,btohqsg
So I guess I add uob one to liquid pay it will count into its min spending like 500 1000 2000 ahahaha,btohqsg
Hi guys  anybody tried trustbank credit card?,btohqsg
What's your review on it ?,btohqsg

U already strike out the card yourself haha. Then use uob ppv,btohqsg
You can consider ocbc titanium if u have one,btohqsg
Basically my rule of thumb to use those with monthly cap for amount within the cap then use other like smrt or titanium (yearly cap) for amount bigger,btohqsg
Will it be better to use ShopeePay or CRMC for Shopee purchases,btohqsg
lol.I don't have ocbc titanium card lol,btohqsg
Yup that why suggest uob ppv,btohqsg
It match the monthly spend and pool uni dollar among all uob card,btohqsg

What card to use to pay for Airbnb? I am using standard chartered credit card and paid extra due to cross borders fees.,btohqsg
which standard chartered credit card are you using?,btohqsg
I am using the spree card. I didn’t realise about the cross border fee until i checked that the bank statement doesn’t tally with the receipt i paid in airbnb.,btohqsg
Revolut is a better card to use with no cross border fees. I believe other people here may have better suggestions though,btohqsg

Has anyone got their Revolut 20% cashback from sep?,btohqsg
Hello! I've started using my citibank cash back credit card but I dont understand how the cashback is calculated on the app. I got few dining transactions that are not pending anymore (total around 200$) but the cashback shown is less than 0.50cts. I would have expected something like  6% of 200$ to be shown on the app but that's not the case. Any idea? Thanks!,btohqsg
u got spend min $800 posted in statement month?,btohqsg
So the dining/groceries/petrol cashback total amount will be shown on the app after the $800 will be spent ?,btohqsg
few days after statement date then will receive the bonus 5.75% or 7.75% and will auto credit the cashback (multiples of $10) if accumulated min $50 cashback. Remaining will reflect in app,btohqsg
Ya HSBC one I call before not bad,btohqsg
Uob evol and live fresh won't count towards cashback for hospital contact less right,btohqsg
When i pay at counter its MCC 8062  but if pay online its MCC 8099. MCC 8099 is not excluded for UOB one but im not sure for evol,btohqsg
Anyone what is the MCC for clinic like Fullerton Healthcare?,btohqsg
MCC 8099 is not excluded but im not sure if it works the same if u pay online,btohqsg
payment online of mcc 8099 should count to uob evol online,btohqsg
May I ask what is the MCC code for driving license centre  Bukit Batok? Tried to find online but unable to. Looking for cashback either UOB EVOL / HSBC Revolution,btohqsg

Hi  do I hav to sign up hsbc everyday global acc when i sign up for hsbc revolution?,btohqsg
Hi guys! If I sign up for Citibank cashback + credit card from singsaver  how long will it take for them to send us the free gift if we hit all the criteria,btohqsg
no need but good to get everyday+ rewards on ega,btohqsg
Question: can i invest all my CPF OA or need to have a bal of $20k remain inside?  Thanks.,btohqsg
Any idea where to find the T&Cs for this? Can't find anything online,btohqsg
Is it true that owning more than 4 credit cards will affect credit score?,btohqsg
You can only invest after setting aside 20k in ur OA.,btohqsg
What will affect your credit score is when u dont pay the bills. Sometime late payment also dont affect the score as long as u pay. My friend hold more then 20 card with various bank score still Aa,btohqsg
However holding too many credit card does mean it will taken into consideration when you are apply loan in future as it does goes into the total debt ratio consideration. Always good to maintain a good credit score so that future loan will be easier to approve as it is a tracl record for bank to review your repaying reputation,btohqsg
If no debt will not affect total debt ratio right? Does not matter if have many credit cards.,btohqsg
In theory holding credit card mean u have borrow credit in access,btohqsg
If u hold mulitple credit card with mulitple bank let say 5k limit with 10 bank  it mean u can owe 50k for credit card debt,btohqsg
It does affect how bank view your possible debt situation  varies from bank to bank,btohqsg
Yes yes that's what i feel too. Might want to buy flat in the near future,btohqsg
I was call up by citibank recently as i apply for my 6th card with them  they advice me to cancel 1 as they only allow 5 card with them at most,btohqsg
I call them up and ask why  then they say it is company policy  which i think have to do with default risk with too many credit card. However mine was secured credit card so after much explanation i was approve for the 6th card,btohqsg
So even though the credit card share same credit limit  it still is a concern to the bank if u hold too many credit card ( higher default risk/bad debt),btohqsg
Do mind that i pay the credit card once i make the spending and no default risk  the department still need to assess the 6th card risk to them,btohqsg
I have to get them to check the past record and explain to them i am big spender,btohqsg
This is just Citibank's policy ah,btohqsg
Yup correct which i refer to varies from bank to bank,btohqsg
But this is an example of how bank access your default risk at the backenf,btohqsg
Hello guys  does anyone know if the citibank cashback card linked to amaze give cashback when spending overseas? (As instarem card converts all transactions to online?),btohqsg
Like i hold around 7 to 8 card with uob  no question ask for secured credit card but i do have long spending history with uob,btohqsg
yes  so long mcc is eligible,btohqsg
ok but does this affect credit score or total debt servicing ratio?,btohqsg
This exact u can ask the bank when you are applying for loan. Every bank have different consideration. Do rmb that bank go through credit bereau check before approving any loan  meaning they can see the number of credit card u hold with every sg bank.,btohqsg
It is all about different bank risk assessment. Just like insurance company,btohqsg
What will happen more likely is that if one bank view the credit card as possible debt they might lower the loan amount that they are willing to approve to you,btohqsg
Do note the idea of a credit card is borrowing future credit  even if u dont use it today u can in future. So bank review all this  bank are typical to borrow u umbrella on sunny day and take it bank on rainy day  they are not charity  it is profit driven,btohqsg
Any one got any idea pay using grab pay to grab merchant not earning point now since 4 October,btohqsg

Citi card holders: how many days does it take to receive the card (counting from the day you submit the application)?,btohqsg

Now grab nerf u dont even have 0.3,btohqsg
But the annual fee is like $180 i don’t think i cn hit that amt of cashback,btohqsg
If your parents or brother etc have higher income above 30k maybe they can subscribe amex tcb or uob amex then top up your grab wallet using it. Then pay them back in cash.,btohqsg
This is for general SG QR code payment?Or only specific to hawkers?,btohqsg
Annual fee can be request to waive,btohqsg
If u are a regular spender  it can be done easily by calling the hotline and try for autowaiver. If auto dont work just get to a cso and get them to review,btohqsg
Nestia app logo don't see often on shops or f&b,btohqsg
Can just scan meh on sGQR,btohqsg
Or try this if income lower then 30khttps://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/banking-with-us/cards/credit-cards/cimb-awsm-card.html,btohqsg

"Hi all  i just watched the video ""The BEST Ways to Invest in S&P 500 with Cash/CPF/SRS in 2022"" I'm relatively new to investing and got a few qns i wish to ask..- Chris mentioned that VOO has a 0.03% of expense ratio and SPY has 0.09% expense ratio. May i ask when do i pay this expense ratio? If i were to buy it from say the trading app MooMoo?- - is this expense ratio  on top of all the MooMoo platform fees and trading fees?- I noticed that currently VOO is $339.320 but SPY is $369.320 and the Index is 3707.15. May i know why is there such a huge contrast difference between VOO and SPY? Eventhough in the video Chris said that it monitors the SnP500 index closely.",btohqsg

Hi does anyone know if after a payment has been made to your Citi rewards MasterCard  does it reflect on the Citi mobile app or the statements?,btohqsg
When I made the payment on Monday  it was reflected as still processing. But today when I checked  the payment isn’t there anymore and my balance is still the same,btohqsg
very weird  just now i called dbs  the person told me 8099 not eligible for dbs ww 10x points,btohqsg
It’s not inside the “view all transactions”,btohqsg
why not? anyway this is trialed and tested,btohqsg
that is why i am confuse and i called in to ask.,btohqsg
because at first she dont want to entertain me because i havent charge to the card yet.but i told her i already have the mcc code. she insist i need to charge  then end up maybe she just want to brush me off.,btohqsg
is it an actual charge or holding charge? when u say balance still the same means you not actually charged for the transaction? what kind of transaction?,btohqsg
think u can just refer to the Terms and conditions yourself  quite clearly not excluded,btohqsg
She say that 8099 is under professional services and in the T&C professional service is excluded wor 🤷🤷🤷,btohqsg
It was a holding charge on Monday. But then it disappeared and did not become an actual charge. The money was already deducted from my DBS but not reflected as an actual charge,btohqsg
transaction on citibank card right? how does dbs gets into the picture?,btohqsg
No I mean I use my DBS to pay for my citirewards MasterCard. Initially it was reflected as incoming holding transaction amount from DBS. But thereafter it disappeared,btohqsg
is it payment via FAST from dbs bank to Citibank card? payment successful?maybe check again tomorrow,btohqsg
You should always be in debt if you want to grow your wealth  take the remaining sum  hold cash for now and enter S&P500 around mid-June next year or just put into other etf fixed income  or you really scared of market  or top up CPF and put it into some other investments,btohqsg
Be in debt but pay down as fast as possible  sell that flat and buy another one when MOP  then redo this trick,btohqsg
Hi Desmond The expense ratios are 'in-built'. Won't see any further deductions or notices to pay more. It's 'hidden'  so to speak.The absolute numbers for VOO SPY etc are just arbitrary. There are many ETFs that track the SnP 500 all with different 'absolute values'. You can't buy the SnP 500 index per se  but one can buy an ETF that tracks the SnP 500. 'Closely tracks' or 'monitors closely' refer to if the SnP drops by 5% for example  the ETF also drops by the same amount. This is my understanding.@ChrisHMSGI hope I got this right?,btohqsg

So u get 6 percent easily,btohqsg
Same as uob Evol and dbs liveBy catagory,btohqsg
Unless u can meet there t&c if not haed to meet there specific catagory,btohqsg
After the new change  they claim up to 10 percent fron nov onwarddBut minimum spend is 8008 percent cap at 25 for both online and contactless8 percent cap at 25 for foreign currencyAnd other catLet say u spend 400 on online and 400 on contactless in the past u get 48 cashbackAfter change u only get 25,btohqsg
So u divide 25 by 800 minimum spend u ge your effective cashback,btohqsg
I dont think usually ppl will have foreign currency transaction every month bah,btohqsg

1. AXS blocked Amaze. Should get 4mpd so long mcc not excluded. Most of these transactions you listed should be ok  except not such if parking sg is under govt. services and thus excluded.2. Topup Gpmc with Amex TCB or uob absolute to get 1.5%/1.7%. Use GPMC pay taxes on AXS app/website,btohqsg
using GPMC is the same as scanning QR code correct?,btohqsg
parking.sgi use AMEX TCB as can get 1.5% since no say exclusion...,btohqsg
Think now cannot use Grab scan QR for AXS app/website already,btohqsg
for offline purchase/payment  can Amaze pay installment?Any points awarded?,btohqsg
CRMC air ticket can get miles ?,btohqsg
got points but amaze can’t pay instalment  you need to use shop back or grab pay later,btohqsg
i just tried yesterday  can still scan Paynow QR,btohqsg
Only UEN or SGQR. No longer possible for personal PayNow,btohqsg
hi gurus  another question  I have recently tenanted an entire unit and the rental is $4500  may I know what's the best cardup +credit cards combinations I should use to maximise my rewards?,btohqsg
cuz most cards maximum cashback is up to $1000 expenditure,btohqsg
When using Grab to pay at insurance at AXS  paying by card is the same as scan to pay correct?,btohqsg
yall got try paying seasonal parking with gpmc? keeps getting error 🥶 hope they didnt exclude,btohqsg
Very close to your unit rental haha,btohqsg
"Anyway  no cards award so high for cardup/ipaymy. If not you're just paying a fee to ""Buy"" miles",btohqsg
Try phone instead of website it happened to me also last month. Or use different web browsers,btohqsg
hahahah i saw this news just now too  but it's not my unit,btohqsg
i see  guess i have to make it between a combination of cashback + miles then,btohqsg
if i were to get a pretty straight forward and less spending catagory exclusion for a fresh grad what card do i get,btohqsg
The 10% cashback applicable for Grab top up?,btohqsg
Im guessing yes. Others got dp?,btohqsg
Not sure if this is called stacking ytd I went to Safra ate in the restaurant  Safra member 15% discount  payment with ShopBack 5%  using newly signed up Cimb card to meet min spending for rewards. 3X combo,btohqsg
Hi all for uob one card does recurring payments like mobile   conservancy   insurance payments   utilities get any cashback ?,btohqsg
only if mcc not excluded  mobile and utilities ok. conservancy and insurance excluded.,btohqsg
Recently gave a call to UOB regarding this. Not applicable for Grab top up,btohqsg
lol  the CSO just give the most conservative answer lah,btohqsg
Read the TnC? Any exclusions related to Grab or prepaid?,btohqsg
Similar to true cashback promo whereby they exclude grab top up for the bonus cashback. This make sense as they allow that it like free money for user easily,btohqsg
True cashback dun give bonus cashback for grab topuo. But uob absolute is totally separate.,btohqsg
Yes but if u think from bank point of view,btohqsg
U get your answer  they reserve to right to change tnc anytime they like,btohqsg
uh  so I asked OP check TnC  no point assume anything,btohqsg
From uob perspective u do realise they not as agressive as other bank to expand. 120 is consider low compare to other bank but is high compare to the past campaign,btohqsg
More aggressive would be citibank among all other bank,btohqsg
no point postulate uob's stand when there is TnC to clearly spell out whether Grab topup eligible or not,btohqsg
Then u can help them find the tnc loh,btohqsg
Since their call uob and the cso stated no liao,btohqsg
haha I do it if I get paid lor,btohqsg

When i see at bank discretion i will play safe liao,btohqsg
this tnc ask to refer the usual tnc of uob absolute. so not excluded lah,btohqsg
It is vague and not specific for certain tnc,btohqsg
uh so far ppl got the bonus cashback. And no harm to just try.,btohqsg
Anyway from definition of transaction in TnC it is not excluded.,btohqsg
Hey guys  is it the best strategy to use uob absolute cashback to top up grab  then top up revolut to make scheduled bank transfers such as paying my employee salary  and office rental etc?,btohqsg
Hi all  for the dbs woman’s world card  will I still get points if I am over the $2k limit for the bonus points?,btohqsg
Depends. Last time I apply tcb. The cso stated straight away can top up grab to get the cashback.,btohqsg
Yea Grab topup used to be explicitly stated as eligible on amex tcb website. If no ambiguity then CSO no need to be conservative.,btohqsg
Amex TCB still can enjoy the $5000 -3% cash back not sure about the uob amex - edited seem seem like I recalled recently amex nerff for new usersOld users still unaffected,btohqsg
Hi guys  does sending money via Instarem incur admin charges?,btohqsg
Is this the same as remittance?,btohqsg
never tried but from what I know Instarem only has transfer overseas,btohqsg
Hmm okay it’s my first try w Instarem,btohqsg
Hey just wondering why would ppl use cardup or ipaymy if you can just use revolut to do bank transfer?,btohqsg
Let's just say that Revolut is very strict about compliance. Especially on ownself transfer to ownself bank accounts,btohqsg
Thanks Chris! But if it’s legit bank transfers for office rental  salary payment etc  then i shld just top up right?,btohqsg
Sure  as long as you can support your transfers with documentation if questioned by Revolut,btohqsg
Thank you!!This makes me start thinking about is if people transferring to themselves using other apps haha to churn miles all that,btohqsg
"Can I ask something about T-bills?May I know what exactly determines the coming T-bills interest rate yield? As in how does the auction works?Correct me if I'm wrong  we are supposed to apply for it as ""Non competitive bids"" before the auction starts?Which also means if the auction goes wrong and a lower yield (2.4%) than 3.77% is achieved  we have no choice but to accept n honor it?",btohqsg

Guys  can use grab pay to pay income taxes to earn cashback from Amex tcb even if i am currently paying income taxes by giro?,btohqsg
If my current income tax is 200$  can I pay 100$ by grabpay and the rest will be giro?,btohqsg
Then how to use? Only by cash?,btohqsg
Not 99%They seems to have some set of Criteria.But so far  I have no problem waiving Citibank and POSB.,btohqsg
There is 2 options1.callbank use auto system get waiver2. Cancel the card wait 1 year and go for new application promo again,btohqsg
As long as you use the credit card or if you have installment plan. Usually they will waive  so far I know OCBC waive automatically for me and sometimes UOB.The rest like citibank all that. I usually check the app or call to waive.,btohqsg
Agree with these 2 points. Cancel the card and wait for 1 year very important. Never know when your spending will benefit you for a new credit card.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if i were to cancel my standard charted cc but keep my trust bank.  Will i be considered new to bank 12 months later? Might call the cso to ask them,btohqsg
U srioll own the trust card from SCB,btohqsg
What's the best debit card currently?,btohqsg
What debit card do you link to amaze.,btohqsg
Depends on what you're looking for. Cashback on all or selected categories  or low overseas transaction fees  or something else?,btohqsg
2 cards I can suggest:If you spend >$400/month  DBS Visa debit card  2-4% cashback on certain categories.If you're between 18-26yo  SC Jumpstart card 1% cashback all spending,btohqsg
Would like to seek experts opinion here.My monthly spending mainly is 850 rental  100 income tax  150 telco...I think Cardup paired with MBB Platinum Visa will be the best for cash back?,btohqsg
yes  for the telco in excess of $1k monthly  if can pay telco directly online can use Scb spree for 2%,btohqsg
also no need to go through cardup for telco,btohqsg
anyone knows how to cancel trust credit card,btohqsg
Sounds like a bad omen for things to come,btohqsg

You cant use shopback for that,btohqsg

If want to go through shopback then can consider hsbc revo,btohqsg
would like to ask with the frank nerf  if say i use the card go spend in msia  is it i will have to pay the 3+% fx fee and suffer the subpar rates on top of that? or how does it work,btohqsg
yes 3.25% fee  visa exchange rate. but u get 8% rebate,btohqsg
but after all the fees yada yada  effective cashback would be around 4+%?,btohqsg
or possibly less  at around high 3 because of the rate 🥲,btohqsg
yes  every card also has exchange rate so no way to avoid that. 4+% net rebate is as good as it can be already.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGCan I ask why do you top up your SA with cash and not with your OA since OA is earning less money?If I don't use cash  what am I losing out?,btohqsg
Likely 1. As New to bank. Unless they forget.,btohqsg
My personal preference would also be cash for the purpose of tax deduction,btohqsg
But it's only 1 time up to 8k cash contribution right?,btohqsg
Every year until your SA hit FRS. So if you do an OA to SA transfer  basically you will hit your FRS faster.,btohqsg
I thought so too. So will just spend on one card then. Thank you JJ,btohqsg
The one that give most rebate for your spending. In consideration are maybank family and friends  citi cashback  uob one  cimb visa signature  uob evol  dbs livefresh  ocbc frank....,btohqsg

Anyone has an idea how to see your actual balance in EZlink pay by wallet card (using it to pay for public transport),btohqsg
Nahh the balances never make sense one and can't see anything in TL simplygo too (as a result becomes frustrating when my card actually got declined when boarding the bus),btohqsg
this is because they deduct the max amount before calculating the final amount. similar to EZpay... every 2 weeks -$50 in my CC...,btohqsg
simplygo dun show card balance ah,btohqsg
Oh thought he want to see usage,btohqsg
Ya odd it won't show card balance,btohqsg
Mayhe is it not fully sync wirh the new updates,btohqsg

how to apply under singsaver for cimb infinite card if the route is going via fd deposit ?,btohqsg
If you want to get the Singsaver gifts  suggest to sign up for the entry cards first. then after that work with CIMB directly for fixed deposit and VI,btohqsg
True lah.. but shouldn't take this long to post a few transactions (over two weeks) and then at least make an effort toreflect balances that are put on hold instead of just stating an amount as pending  but when u add up it doesn't even tally#justrantingalittleAnyway i decided to move to Revolut given I don't have any cards that reward for public transport  but at least i have the transparency of how much I spent per trip.

Hello! Not sure if this has been answered  but I have always had a question about CC fee waivers. Most banks will charge you the fee first  then you need to request a waiver (year 2 onwards generally). Despite all strategies  if they reject your fee waiver  and you cancel the CC immediately  are you still charged the fee? Or do they reverse it? Or is it pro-rated?,btohqsg
Thank you! but the website seems to be stuck after i enter my email,btohqsg
They will just not charge you and say goodbye,btohqsg
Note that you can’t request waiver before they charge you first. So they charge you first  then you cancel. Would they reverse it?,btohqsg
Ya most of the time is like that,btohqsg
But nowadays waiver requests are automated. Hardly any gets rejected. If they do  you call manually,btohqsg
