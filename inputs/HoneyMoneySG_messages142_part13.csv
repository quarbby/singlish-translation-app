Kris pay > GPay/Apple pay> which u put ur amaze/ DBS wwmc as ur mobile wallet.if amaze   tag to citi rewards,btohqsg
I tried Apple Pay and I get the miles#dp,btohqsg
Did you get your points in the end?,btohqsg
think stack is not an appropriate word to use here,btohqsg
whats dp  so you use Apple Pay to pay thru the Kris+ paymentAnd you use DBS WWMC to pair with your amaze card  so the Apple pay is transacting on the amaz card  and ultimiately the DBS WWMCerm but DBS WWMC already is eligible for online transation Kris+ recog the wwmc as online right?So anyway what extra mile u get ah,btohqsg
Wwmc cannot pair with Amaze  DBS nerfed it already. Yes  there‚Äôs no need to pair with Amaze if using on Kris+ because it‚Äôs already online.,btohqsg
Yes jasmine I did!!!! It‚Äôs working,btohqsg
Oops! Use it with might be a better phrase,btohqsg
hi all  i am new to SNACK  I can't seem to add credit card while redeeming the products (e.g. life  accident)  anyone can teach how to proceed?,btohqsg
To put things simple Link ur DBS wwmc and Amaze to ur mobile wallet.Use either one with kris+.But since u are gg to buy a Mac book  just use DBS wwmc since u can hit the miles in $1.5kAmaze + citi is only capped at 1k and also note that if u didn‚Äôt change ur citi to calander month  ur amaze local spending cap and Citi cap might be different,btohqsg
i dont have that card yet  is it possible to buy with PPV or HSBC pay with Kris+ and still earn the Kris+ MPD and the Credit Card rewards (4mpd)?Assuming shop is challenger and harvy norman,btohqsg
Gotta check mcc and see if they have the right mcc in the whitelist for ppv or Revo,btohqsg

Hi  need some advice regarding CC statement - I didn‚Äôt pay anything this month but somehow it reflects the that there was $280.84 received as payment. It doesn‚Äôt mention about this payment anywhere in the statement and this is from the last line.Anyone knows what it means?,btohqsg
Yes  $300 from Apple but it has since be credited further up in the statement. Transactions in the app also doesn‚Äôt reflect this $280.84,btohqsg
any fees of 19.16 alongside this refund?,btohqsg
if ur statement doesn‚Äôt add up  contact the bank‚Ä¶ how u expect strangers with no access to ur statements or txns to help ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Do you know what the ‚Äúpayment received‚Äù at the end meant  despite me not making payment?Or have you experienced this before?,btohqsg
You probably want to check with the bank on the transaction.,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just a general term for any credit received during the month. it may reflect refunds  reversals or whatever adjustments made by the bank,btohqsg
Ah got it. I think may have been a reversal instead. Thanks for this,btohqsg

For your info  I just returned from china  all my payment was settled using alipay and WeChat. I paid a tour package in cny using alipay linked to credit card  although my credit card give me a good exchange rate but alipay still charged a 3% fee for amount above rmb400.,btohqsg
need to cart out at 12am sharp.voucher normally gone very fast,btohqsg
Did you try asking merchant whether you can split payment? I will be going in Dec... Asked the local tour guide she said can split payment so long as all payments were processed on the same day. But wexin pay recently announced they will impose surcharge even if under 200rmb if eventually one spends 1k or more in a month. I wonder if Alipay will follow soon?,btohqsg
Ok to split payment into 2 or 3  but my package cost rmb8k ++üòÇ,btohqsg
My one is 4k. I intend to scan and pay 20 times. üôäüòÖ,btohqsg
The handling fee apply to alipay linked to card  no fee incurred if you pay using alipay wallet,btohqsg
Can check with your local guide if you exchange cash with them to transfer rmb to your alipay,btohqsg
Ahh i see. I tried since 12am but couldnt. I try again next week üòÖ,btohqsg
