Winnie’s thinking is too short term. He force down the profits generated by services provided by big biz thinking the masses will benefit from the lower cost but he forgot it is the profit generated that these big biz can reward the value generating staff to further improve biz going forward. If staff put in so much effort even sacrifice their time to do so n not get rewarded or appreciated  many will give up or worse emigrate overseas to  countries their appreciate them. Rich people n progressive companies might leave too to China’s lose of talented people n organisations unless he wants to bring China back to Mao’s days of closed economy thinking they can be self sufficient.,btohqsg
You see they totally ignored the external payments for Evergrande. But domestically central govt paid to avoid internal chao. I worry China will ignore all external debt then all foreign financial institutions can kenna another add on global contagion crisis.,btohqsg
When a communist leader becomes too powerful  it is always dangerous as any policy he wanted will go through.He is by far the most powerful Chinese leaders after Deng Xiaoping,btohqsg
Yes. Can always go back to China’s history. No change. He undid what Deng did when he open up China to progress till today.,btohqsg
Now ccp only wanna to survive by their own country.. external they don’t care much..See the way they crack down.. target 1 by 1..,btohqsg
Indeed but that may mean talented Chinese may emigrate. Early generation know fully well how life was like in the old days,btohqsg

I am sure. You just see how many of them buy property overseas n biz too to prepare for this possible day,btohqsg

I worry therefore another much bigger financial crisis coming so much bad debt due to loans to China companies n so much bigger amounts all unpaid. Can all countries apply international law on China to pay up? So far no one succeeded,btohqsg
SG property will boom as more Chinese tycoons will divert funds overseas,btohqsg
To be when they ignore to pay the first instalment for overseas but paid for domestic I already sensed danger n true enough the 2nd n 3rd were also ignored. And this is only one company. China is so big  how many companies borrowed overseas? In good days financial institutions earned from Chinese companies  now look like is pay back time  capital also may be gone n swallowed up,btohqsg
I think if global crisis strikes  globally most assets may crash. I may be too extreme but I think we all shd not over invest or overbuy,btohqsg
