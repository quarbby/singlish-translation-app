Looks likes amex more all rounds no need to be specific McC,btohqsg
Need to spread out 2 diff card,btohqsg
but some places dun accept amex. And probably u get better rewards using other cards.,btohqsg
Ya amex not as accepted like visa Mastercard,btohqsg
Amex pay on their APp can use on QR at hawkers too,btohqsg
lots of better cards for that,btohqsg
Don't tell me trust card hahahaha,btohqsg
yea  good if the same store dun accept other payment mode that give better rewards,btohqsg
Ya with grab out of QR or gimped point amex pay on QR at hawkers is another option,btohqsg
uh maybe 20 better cards than amex for ntuc. Trust card actually not bad lah,btohqsg
grab still ok considering get the rebate for topup by Amex. Any random grab points won is a bonus.,btohqsg

Hi  I am a first timer buying sia air ticket. If I have a krisflyer member and I am buying ticket for 3 pax  when fill up information for the 3 pax  do I need to fill up my krisflyer member 3 times on different passenger to get 3 times the mile or I can only get 1 time the mile only? Thank you.,btohqsg
I read somewhere it wasn‚Äôt the best way to use the points,btohqsg
When buying ticket for others I usually just put my own krisflyer account. You get miles for each full fair ticket I think,btohqsg
Which are the CC with no min that is suitable for low spender?,btohqsg
If buy 3 pax ticket  do u key in 3 times krisflyer account or one time will do? Thank you.,btohqsg

Hi  just to check  currently I am planning to buy an air ticket roughly 2k and I have just registered Amex sia krisflyer blue card which need to spend 2k for the first 6 months  for the 2k air ticket should I spend on this card or apply a wwmc which give 4 miles per dollar? Thank you.,btohqsg
I am buying air ticket on Singapore airline. Currently I haven't book any hotel yet  so my next spending will on hotels  my plan is suppose buy air ticket using amex krisflyer card and apply for wwmc and spend my hotel spending on the card. Is it a good way to maximize all the miles?,btohqsg
What I meant was at overseas using card to pay not online hotel booking websites,btohqsg
Yes  I answered assuming u paying hotel over the counter when overseas,btohqsg
Trazora already gave you the best ideas,btohqsg
Can use Krisflyer uob too. 3mpd uncapped with your SIA spending,btohqsg
But for signup bonus  amex will have a better deal,btohqsg
Thanks Chris for your suggestion. If for around 2k hotel payment  best card is DBS wwc is it?,btohqsg
Currently my annual income is less than $8k  which I can't apply DBS wwc. I rmb your video mention apply other card first then apply for wwmc. Which DBS card will u suggest to get first? Thank you.,btohqsg

Hi Chris  is it better to go for Miles card or Cashback if my main spending is online shopping and food outside? My current spending card is the Grab combo with the UOB  but recently I have been traveling around asia a bit and I'm thinking if I should get a miles card  planning more travels for following yearsEdit: I am mid 20s  still living with parents and no kids so my monthly spending fluctuates a lot  sometimes few hundreds sometimes over a thousand,btohqsg
I saw somewhere that shengsong withdrawal machine can cash out grab points.,btohqsg
As in convert the points to cash?,btohqsg
If you like business class go for miles  if biz class dont appeal to you go for cashback,btohqsg
you use the 'scan to pay' function on the grab app. Scan the paynow qr code generated by the machine according to the amount you want to withdraw. there will be a function to use points to subsidise the transaction. ~,btohqsg
Wow thanks  I might go check that out hahaha üëç,btohqsg
may i know why standard charted unlimited card 1.5% unlimited cash back but instead ppl prefer american true cashback ? thanks coz i have both card i just wondering..,btohqsg
amex true cashback not excluded for Grab topup. Std chart unlimited excluded. Actually maybank barcelona give 1.6% and less exclusion than std chart.,btohqsg
oh isee.. thanks for that . i just notice . i use unlimited SC card to top up my ezlink card thru their ezlink apps. it still eligible for 1.5% cash back.,btohqsg
Is it better to get $150 or the bonus miles for first sign up for DBs altitude? And currently I have amex sia krisflyer blue card  for DBS altitude is it better to get visa or amex? Thanks.,btohqsg
