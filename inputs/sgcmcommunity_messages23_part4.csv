I mean if you are afraid to change then donâ€™t. Just donâ€™t be complaining when the fuel gets to 5 dollar a litre for Ron 95zShopping centres have more and more  and everywhere is installing chargers.Anyway regarding petrol itâ€™s not 1 min ok. Look at spc an sinopec queue. U will be lucky to walk out in 10-15 minutes.,btohqsg
Kor kors  is Mustang a performance car?,btohqsg
Time to eat medicine my friend,btohqsg
because everyone will stop and look and take picture?,btohqsg
Go shell  3 minutes I finish fueling already. Can eat chocolate also,btohqsg
because mustang love to carry more than 2 people on its roof and bonnet,btohqsg
Mustang must make sound then performance hor,btohqsg
And best colour for mustang is maroon because all the other things on it will camouflage then,btohqsg
It takes more than 5 minutes lor. Shell paywave need to tap 2 times,btohqsg
You filling lorry ah? My 85L tank I fill when I reach 1/4th  finish in 3 minutes liao,btohqsg
Anywhere  shell usually no queue from my experience,btohqsg
how you know i have been taking diarrhoea pills whole weekend...,btohqsg
no he charging tesla. need 15mins,btohqsg
No leh... those near to neighborhood all packed when news of prices hike,btohqsg
Walk in to pay?The time taken to swing by the station?Whereas an EV can be simply plugged in and charged when you are doing nothing with no detour ðŸ¤­,btohqsg
HEng ah... luckily Shell don't charge me extra 5L of V Power if I take a bit longer to pay and move away  coz I am buying lots of chocolate and instant noodles in the shop.,btohqsg
Petrol kiosk shopping is the best!,btohqsg
Actually 10 seconds to plug it in and out ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I go fuel station buy coffee do shopping. EV I need to make sure no ICE car in electric lot  then see if the lot is not taken up by another car also,btohqsg
Petrol kiosk food nice also! Quick bites solid  some have polar puffs and cakes. Shiok!,btohqsg
that day i pump esso  i immediately redeem my free laksa wahahahaha,btohqsg
Many times also pull into a gas station and see cars beside the pump who went in to buy things or pay,btohqsg
I wonder how to not complain if fuel becomes 5 dollars ? haha .. i think it is more than just the petrol cost when we meet there ... Generally your car will be more expensive than current .. when fuel price increase  electricity price will follow suit .. Is collective suffering .. not about EV and ICE liao,btohqsg
Bottom line is  if you donâ€™t mind the rising fuel costs no one is forcing you to an EV,btohqsg
What time you go petrol station? Always have people at your petrol kiosk ah?,btohqsg
is there any EV 7 seater SUV ah?,btohqsg
Petrol can be taxed to penalise car drivers like you and me.Why do you think they ban diesel for passenger vehicles?Electricity on the other hand cannot have duty slapped on it overnight like petroleum.,btohqsg
Governments around will want to make back lost revenue on reduced fuel sales as well!,btohqsg
At night observe folks buy rubbers ðŸ¤ª,btohqsg
and.. tempting though it might be  let us not look at one fear factor in isolation (i wish my stocks go that way but it never does) on fuel pricing  because our electricity also dont come from nuclear  or hydro,btohqsg
But electricity can be generated through solar and other renewables  what about production of oil,btohqsg
Who say cannot? Why cannot tax electricity? If you require more charging infrastructure and more electricity supply  government will surely tax with that reason. Also so much of your electricity still powered by coal,btohqsg
Morning or night? I wouldnâ€™t specially leave the house to get petrol,btohqsg
I hear say stress can generate electricity too .. haha,btohqsg
Infrastructure for that still required though  government still needs to pay for that  how to pay? Higher Tax on electricity,btohqsg
Lol. Singapores grid is more than 90% natural gas. Where are you reading this coal argument? Facebook? Anyway an electric car powered by a coal power plant still has lower emissions than an ice veh.Electricity can flow anywhere  as long as u put a power point. The same canâ€™t be said for fuel,btohqsg
I usually go lunch time or later at night  no queue at my usual stations! Maybe you can look around for empty stations too!,btohqsg
Bukit timah stretch best time to go after midnight,btohqsg
Sure ah? I suggest you read studies on emissions from production of batteries and EV cars. One great comparison is done by Volvo on production of xc40 ICE and xc40 recharge. They have determined that the break even point for emissions where the EV will be beneficial is only after you drive it for 140 000km. Until that point the ICE car still less emissions,btohqsg
3 minutes... fuel how many litres in 3 min?,btohqsg
Unfortunately I donâ€™t really drive out for lunch.But with an EV  just plug it in when I go to work or at a mall and come back later. So far thatâ€™s less of a hassle for me than getting petrol ðŸ˜‡,btohqsg
There are plenty of petrol stations in sg ... no need to queue that long .. pump and go ..,btohqsg
Oh referring to that volvo study again? Lol remember what else does volvo make? ICE cars,btohqsg
so what is a performance car? c63 is it,btohqsg
They make both ICE and EV cars...,btohqsg
The breakeven for pure EVs and Teslas can be as little as 20k miles depending on the level of renewables the grid is on. Surely no where near 100k miles ðŸ˜€,btohqsg
lol oh my god hahaha i go interview ppl liao lol enhoy have fun,btohqsg
You ask the unkers to help pump  take the longest,btohqsg
You're only taking into account the fuel used to run the ICE car and electricity used to run the EV  not taking into account emissions produced during production of batteries let alone the disposal of battery waste,btohqsg
Folks during pandemic all majiam scare to hands onâ€¦,btohqsg
