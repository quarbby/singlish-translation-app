Is it the harder practise papers,btohqsg
i planning r5 12 below :<<,btohqsg
Naw I don‚Äôt think I can,btohqsg
For real kills me all the time,btohqsg
eng 4math 1chi 1sci 3humans 2poa 1,btohqsg
I wanted everything A1 then literature B3,btohqsg
All the best to your A-math tmr!,btohqsg
But at the rate things are going,btohqsg
Thanks I'm hoping to not get a U,btohqsg
My school L1R5 13 enough to get onto the podium already,btohqsg
we can only judge calibre if the student maintains a constant range of grades for the same subject,btohqsg
I thought you were aiming for raw 6? It was in your profile previously,btohqsg
and whether his/her result improves further or remains stagnant or not,btohqsg
so eg if someone is borderline A1 for pure chem for common test and Mid year  thats not A1 Calibre,btohqsg
my sch 4 distinctions w a pass in eng cn go podium alr,btohqsg
U still can do it hopefully lol,btohqsg
if someone gets A1 for pure chem common test  and gets an even higher score for mid year  that's a potential A1 calibre,btohqsg
aiya no need 6 raw for DHS also,btohqsg
but i planning aim 12 pts den minus 1 cca points and go via CLEP to dhs so minus 2 more points,btohqsg
This year cop probably rise lol,btohqsg
What can u contribute to hc to make them accept u?,btohqsg
Just try ur best no need think,btohqsg
You know what‚Äôs so sad about my school,btohqsg
uk need pay every mth rite,btohqsg
People that get D7 for English,btohqsg
Can go onto The podium already,btohqsg
Haizz give up on the JC dream,btohqsg
like eg student A fluctuates between B3 and A1 non stop for a year for 4 diff exams,btohqsg
Lol...I said he‚Äôs caliber for A1.. but the prelim he didn‚Äôt do that well..,btohqsg
like ri and hci and nyjc,btohqsg
But still go onto the podium,btohqsg
easiest qn to ask him is whether he finds TYS easy  and his avg score,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why my school is so pathetic,btohqsg
"my sch is ""4distinctions w  a pass in eng""",btohqsg
You teach a math or POA?,btohqsg
My school it‚Äôs just exceptionally well,btohqsg
this is obvs eng pass la so,btohqsg
So NA that don‚Äôt get a single A also can,btohqsg
'All schools are good schools' üòÉ,btohqsg
now see whether student is very careful or careless in exams,btohqsg
Like for real have Sec 5s getting L1R5 of 19,btohqsg
u rarely see sec 5 gettin l1r5 lower than 20,btohqsg
Every school cohort have 1 or 2,btohqsg
If they actually study it‚Äôs not difficult,btohqsg
Ah shit next year probably need to wait for 30 minutes before getting the results. The tension is gonna kill me,btohqsg
nah is not easy for them also even if they study,btohqsg
Oh yea Christian school rite? Need to pray first,btohqsg
i dont need to know that... but ok,btohqsg
I am alrdy genetically predisposed to not scoring,btohqsg
bro my parents stopped at sec sch,btohqsg
and that doesnt mean i cant go uni?,btohqsg
my parents are both bad at sciences,btohqsg
even if they do they aren't hereditary,btohqsg
there's a reason why that graduate mothers eugenics scheme didn't come to fruition,btohqsg
is just an excuse to say why u are bad at studyin,btohqsg
I'm sure u will do well in the end :),btohqsg
I regret so many stuff in sec sch,btohqsg
is just whether they want or not,btohqsg
and whether they study properly or not also,btohqsg
My way of studying probs rrly shit but oh well,btohqsg
every1 has a unique way of studyin ba,btohqsg
heard it's for pure students and other subj combi idk not v sure,btohqsg
Some people have circumstances beyond their control. Medical issues  family issues  all sorts of issues,btohqsg
yes  but in this case  no,btohqsg
I have econs that week but 1 week is still too much imo. They shd separate it out more,btohqsg
the vast majority don't experience such issues  be it fortunately  or unfortunately also,btohqsg
that being said  u all shld cherish ur sec sch teachers more,btohqsg
Some people have death in the immideate family  or undergo operation after operation. So you can't expect much. Not saying these people can't do well  it's just that the circumstances are out of their control,btohqsg
the higher u study  the shittier teacher becomes in general,btohqsg
im gonna give zero ratings to two teachers if im asked to give a review this year,btohqsg
Are ten times better than my primary school ones,btohqsg
My primary school Teachers can all burn in hell,btohqsg
They just don‚Äôt really love the students,btohqsg
yes felt like i was in a nursery prison,btohqsg
They cannnot be bothered to provide proper care and support to the students,btohqsg
Got bullied and they were like,btohqsg
Partly because the class size is so big,btohqsg
maybe until p5/p6 it got much better,btohqsg
i think p1 to p4 was the part that sucked the most,btohqsg
My primary school class was still 40,btohqsg
Because you are younger I guess,btohqsg
P5 was the worst for me,btohqsg
P6 I just secluded myself and played minecraft all day,btohqsg
But 40 is still a massive class size,btohqsg
My JC class is not even 30,btohqsg
But my secondary school teachers can care for such a class,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I think they suck,btohqsg
Maybe because you are more mature so they respect you more,btohqsg
The primary school Teachers didn‚Äôt give us any respect,btohqsg
I find a lot of primary school teachers have little to no respect for students,btohqsg
and thats why sec sch is better,btohqsg
teachers think sec sch students are more mature,btohqsg
I still remember once I forgot to bring my calculator for an exam,btohqsg
Just because ur younger doesn't mean u dont deserve care,btohqsg
in general ah  ofc got exceptions,btohqsg
Then she just said ‚Äòtoo bad‚Äô,btohqsg
I wanted to punch her so badly,btohqsg
I was already like 1.65 by then in P6,btohqsg
Not suprised. I have seen teachers scolding the student for asking if they could borrow something they forgot for an exam. Adding oil to the fire,btohqsg
Will just bounce of the fat,btohqsg
Im trolling some US dude on discord lmo,btohqsg
Technically  it is 'your fault' and 'your problem' for not bringing it. But of course it isn't good to say that,btohqsg
Primary school honestly sucked for me,btohqsg
yes  i rly agree on this too,btohqsg
My friend picked up an eraser,btohqsg
i dont rly blame teachers for sayin 'too bad',btohqsg
For picking an eraser off the floor,btohqsg
when is combined science physics and chemistry written paper?,btohqsg
Some teachers are  you know  like that,btohqsg
Hmm which topic do you find it tough?,btohqsg
He threw me ouf of class,btohqsg
Some  even if you moved the table accidentally they will throw you out,btohqsg
I hope there's not a lot of theory for phy ajsgiagsisveurvehveeh,btohqsg
Made me go ew at a bit of shit,btohqsg
understanding tys  and doin a few prelim papers well is enough to score at least A2 for every subject (except english),btohqsg
look thru ur past things youve done and those u got wrong redo,btohqsg
why  u all dont even experience that until u all go poly/uni,btohqsg
if i get A+ for one of my chem mods this sem  sure,btohqsg
but at this rate  a bit hard ah,btohqsg
There are few types.. which type?,btohqsg
hope for fuzzy to take u in!!!,btohqsg
Didnt even know that. This is why I say I'm screwed,btohqsg
or else how to provide 'free' answers online,btohqsg
Hmm there are few types of questions.. is it you can‚Äôt convert and find the gradient and y-intercept from the starting equation?,btohqsg
Or you can‚Äôt plot the graph correctly,btohqsg
I think I'll just go through and try to learn,btohqsg
I‚Äôll advise you to look at the questions you didn‚Äôt answer correctly  digest the corrections and compare the steps you wrote..,btohqsg
Ok thanks I'll try to look through,btohqsg
Sure no problem. From what I‚Äôve observed  one common mistake is marking x and y values to plot the graph when it‚Äôs not y against x graph (which is usually the case),btohqsg
has anyone skipped any o lvl paper before,btohqsg
like nvr take then also got no reason de,btohqsg
isit ur relative just don‚Äôt give any letter,btohqsg
He say he not feeling well and then go home in the break between 2 papers,btohqsg
cos i planning not to go for amath p1 tmr and p2 on monday,btohqsg
got U grade so want try be like him a not,btohqsg
Anything happen like kena 5 day mc then gone,btohqsg
He say he not feeling good then tell his gf and go home,btohqsg
then his gf call he never pick so gg,btohqsg
so i don‚Äôt need give any letter or MC right,btohqsg
You're scared it appear in your O Level grades is it,btohqsg
F9 and absent doesn't appear in the final results,btohqsg
Try lor see what kind of grade will appear on the cert,btohqsg
They only appear in the result slip,btohqsg
we r talking abt o level,btohqsg
It should only appear on the transcript,btohqsg
i think it won‚Äôt show up on the cert but like idk if need letter or can just say i dw take if cher ask LOL,btohqsg
Well  there is no U for O levels,btohqsg
I'm not condoning it  but honestly there's nothing they can force you to do,btohqsg
jiayou for tmr!! or other papers,btohqsg
no it‚Äôs just that idw take,btohqsg
Those who took the pre-2006 A levels  they also used A1-F9 for the AO level papers. C6 is a pass.,btohqsg
If you really think you confirm f9 and won't use it then I guess you can don't take,btohqsg
Just that if your results were different,btohqsg
i tried dropping with parent letter and talking to HOD but they still didn‚Äôt allow me to drop at start of year siannn,btohqsg
Don't go regretting and think about the what ifs can liao,btohqsg
do u plan to go jc>,btohqsg
No...........need ask parents go to the school to say drop or what,btohqsg
got two days sia tmr n monday,btohqsg
But apparently you can do exams in hospital  so...,btohqsg
???? go see doc two times isit,btohqsg
iirc ur amath cher was like ‚Äúlemme think ok‚Äù then he nvr say anyt,btohqsg
go get ice cream and maggi,btohqsg
shit till can't walk 2 days is in the bag,btohqsg
Or ice water if no money get ice cream,btohqsg
wah u creative HAHAHAHHA i swearrrrr,btohqsg
I guess the best way is to just apply for special consideration or whatever it is called  if you are eligible,btohqsg
u said like to him u wanna drop amath what,btohqsg
then he was like ‚Äúlemme think abt it ‚Äú then aft that he nvr say anyt,btohqsg
yEZ he advised me to skip the paper,btohqsg
But your grade in the transcript will be annotated,btohqsg
just don‚Äôt go the paper they won‚Äôt ask for mc or anything,btohqsg
at the start of the yr,btohqsg
no but it was the HOD who said ‚Äòlemme think‚Äô,btohqsg
Your transcript will have a '+' symbol beside the subject to show that special consideration/extra time etc had been given,btohqsg
thought she‚Äôs skipping ? not extra time or smth,btohqsg
Yeah  what I mean is if she can apply  then that might improve ger grades. Otherwise she is stuck with whatever she has,btohqsg
actually whats the pt of skipping the paper,btohqsg
or take halfway in the day then break time go home,btohqsg
got more time to study for other subjects,btohqsg
instead of taking it and failing it,btohqsg
is that 3hrs really gonna help,btohqsg
y‚Äôall can just be honest with ur opinion,btohqsg
Mess the skipping right then confirm bam gg case,btohqsg
Why not you just try? You don't know what you would get in the end,btohqsg
i mean if she isnt studying for it alr whats the point of taking it,btohqsg
But if you skip  it is guaranteed fail,btohqsg
You guys already studied for SS?,btohqsg
and mostly its about morals ah,btohqsg
I don't revise SS read the news the well read ones do better,btohqsg
its just not the right thing to do?,btohqsg
Did this I already take finish Os in As next year SS only SBQ,btohqsg
Don't try memorising whatever examples there are no point now,btohqsg
Legit dont need study to pass. The mcq is pretty much always 38-40/40,btohqsg
I dun even know how to apply. Dunno how to see,btohqsg
If really no choice then place all the eggs in one basket pin on SBQ,btohqsg
my friend gave up on pure history  like he didnt study for it at all  he still came for O levels last yr and got c6 ah,btohqsg
and amath is easier to score than a content subject,btohqsg

I only have subjects  I cant give up any,btohqsg
she scored rlly badly for amath,btohqsg
Always try even if things get bleak and hope is lost,btohqsg
For humanities  do schools usually tend to mark it strictly and then cambridge marks it more leniently?,btohqsg
probably differs from sch to sch,btohqsg
but i know cambridge tries their best to give marks,btohqsg
Oh ok. My school's average for social studies was D7 and the highest in cohort was just 34/50. So do u think my school is marking very strictly or are we just horrible at ss?,btohqsg
I am very scared for my humans as i have nvr scored above a C5 b4,btohqsg
Oh thank you. I thought i had no hope.,btohqsg
could be strict marking  dont let that stop u,btohqsg
isit hard to get a1 for history?,btohqsg
i wrote things on the spot,btohqsg
cos the topics i studied didnt came out for SEQ,btohqsg
what yall predicting for pure hist,btohqsg
i read both for my own knowledge,btohqsg
my exam was 5 yrs ago,btohqsg
i wished  i got only 3 passesü§°ü§°,btohqsg
My school marked too strict for the year before mine it was still strict for mine,btohqsg
Too strict to the point people went from b4 to a1,btohqsg
Ppl who b4 for prelim got a1 for o lvl?,btohqsg
A lot of people like this so MOE got a little detective mode,btohqsg
A lot of people end in the A from Bs and Cs,btohqsg
Like cold war only no point memorising everything,btohqsg
yeah it happens frequently cuz prelim papers are harder than O levels,btohqsg
Do sec 3 only or sec 4 only,btohqsg
i think u shld just study book 1,btohqsg
Ohh damn so my school is probably strict as well. If i got like 56% for prelims ss  is it possible for me to get a b3 in o lvls?,btohqsg
My cher said probs no option,btohqsg
Because they remove the last topic,btohqsg
Depends on the school tbf there can be increases,btohqsg
Mine increases to A2 from B4 I think,btohqsg
I memorised like mad and then do nothing for SBQ,btohqsg
but for prelims my sch allow us to choose,btohqsg
memorise the textbook not the notes if the SEQ want do very well,btohqsg
do yall not need to revise for amath lol?,btohqsg
Would u feel angry if u lend ur Fren ur notes and then he score better than u? Haha,btohqsg
My teacher doing private training session tomorrow,btohqsg
My script ok my confidence not there so need do,btohqsg
haha my sch doesn't print any sort of notes for hist,btohqsg
I always helped my friend witj questions then he score better than me,btohqsg
Memorise textbook the SEQ settled already one confirm I always memorise textbook,btohqsg
how is econs I heard everyone hates it a lot,btohqsg
i feel its more of like common sense ngl,btohqsg
H1 History is very interesting I get to really go in depth,btohqsg
but bio content heavy alr tho,btohqsg
Is  o level History needed for a level history?,btohqsg
I spread my revision haha so I can one,btohqsg
O level history and A level history the link not there very little,btohqsg
And does people take both Geog and history?,btohqsg
how to cope with bio and hist same day,btohqsg
Memorise a lot bah I can memorise a lot if I want,btohqsg
However I try not to do so max for me is like 10 chapters a day,btohqsg
ya u need time to retain info as well,btohqsg
I teach my pillow the information,btohqsg
pure hist ppl malaya came out alm every year alr then this year how,btohqsg
the last time i took hist was sec 2,btohqsg
i legit hope decol of mya come out,btohqsg
Today I playing among in class I had a feeling it was 2 girls being the imposter,btohqsg
I never say anything and they were the imposters of the game,btohqsg
idk man is among us kinda dying off alr?,btohqsg
the faster something gets popular the faster it becomes unpopular,btohqsg
hi um idk if this is the right platform to ask butI'm studying in an IP school  have pretty good GPA  and A1 for geography. my subject combi in sec 3 and 4 is trip sci geog.should I take geog or econs for jc?why I cant decide:- i have slightly more interest in geog than econs- econs has 5% higher distinction rate than geog (national level  2017)- geog has revised syllabus next year  so it will be slightly easier I guess?- shit ton of content for geog- heard from seniors that most of them end up gg to econs tuition when they cant catch up- most students in my sch take up econs- maybe abt 2-3 classes of geog in jc- econs is a complete new subject and I'm not sure if I'll do well- both subjects are not prerequisites for any uni coursesthe other subjects I want to take is physics chemistry mathpls help! h2 geog or h2 econs,btohqsg
Its likely ur not gg to score,btohqsg
econs is more common sensical than geog,btohqsg
honestly because its a new sub i feel h2 econs? and some things honestly quite common sense wan,btohqsg
so i would say econs if u want an easier time  geog is a content heavy subject  equivalent to h2 bio,btohqsg
the best thing is to be motivated by interest  but if you know its gonna be harder u gotta work smarter and harder,btohqsg
and econs u get to draw graphs! so cool,btohqsg
is econs easier to score? but I  have more interest in geog,btohqsg
if u have interest in geog  just take geog,btohqsg
dont have to think much one,btohqsg
is it true that jc need to mug everyday....,btohqsg
I never revise before exams and I work fine risky move,btohqsg
econs how much to study ah,btohqsg
i feel its not a  lot,btohqsg
its really not that content heavy,btohqsg
Look at the distinction rate for the school that is offering it?,btohqsg
but i take h1 econs  may be a different story,btohqsg
Not much o level econs is quite easy IMO,btohqsg
what is the rate for both to begin with is it already low,btohqsg
Distinction rate for my sch last year was like 84% for 2019 and the previous year 93%,btohqsg
oh so its more than 2 lines they call curves intersecting and call it equilibrium?,btohqsg
I escaped to telegram cos no one knew me,btohqsg
Is easy to guess schs that dw say dist rate,btohqsg
oh my rv i want go I screw so badly,btohqsg
my sch gives v vague results,btohqsg
If I took hmt and went to a decent cca hais,btohqsg
In my opinion o level econs still has less to study than just elect geog itself like I only revised econs the day before prelims can still do decently,btohqsg
rv has I think 1/6 6 dist,btohqsg
always lose marks for this type of bs,btohqsg
Nvm just saw ur message and realised ur talking about it at a JC level  I have to say H2 econs seems to be a fair bit harder than o level econsand since it‚Äôs a new subject you might need more time to adjust to it but I feel that once you get the grasp of it  u should be fine,btohqsg
I heard from seniors that a lot of them fail h2 econs in J1,btohqsg
RV year what wear long pants?,btohqsg
then just clutch A in a levels somehow,btohqsg
Just take subjects u are passionate in,btohqsg
so do I geog or econs,btohqsg
U wont wanna take a subject u have no interesf in,btohqsg
I end up from likin jc econs to hatin it,btohqsg
hay i take chem   but i kinda have no choice LOL,btohqsg
Which part of it did you hate,btohqsg
If I go jc I‚Äôm definitely considering econs,btohqsg
Got the fella that get some masters rite,btohqsg
Masters is simi idk from where one then he brag to everyone,btohqsg
The pj batch nearly or just hit 50% A rate for h1 econs,btohqsg
Other than that  jp econs sucks,btohqsg
what if I'm not PASSIONATE in geog but just have SLIGHTLY more interest,btohqsg
I see history notes then I see geog one I almost vomit,btohqsg
Oh he said hated jc econs so I wanted to ask why lol,btohqsg
Is look thru some a lvl econd/geog stuff,btohqsg
And see which one interest u,btohqsg
i did and geog looks easier,btohqsg
but why is the distinction rate lower than,btohqsg
"He say take econs ""if u wanna know why roads are busy at certain times of the day in cities""",btohqsg
For me I used to like geog more than econs but now it‚Äôs the other way round,btohqsg
I mean cannot rly base on dist rate,btohqsg
Either teachers/sch resources not good enough  or is the students arent good enough,btohqsg
Usually (and unfortunately)  is the latter,btohqsg
ok I will come back when I have another qn,btohqsg
@jianjun21What is a good rp for promos for jp or pj?,btohqsg
Promos doesnt determine how u will do for a lvls,btohqsg
Like my base got a not,btohqsg
I guess it‚Äôs because geog there‚Äôs way too much to memorise  econs there‚Äôs still quite a fair bit to memorise but it is more common sensical so once you understand a concept it‚Äôs slightly harder to forget,btohqsg
must be the malthusian argument you were talking about,btohqsg
Wow I got 60ish too watafak maybe üëâüëà,btohqsg
I need y'all to help me vet a quick email,btohqsg
I got 60 ish cos i didnt study hard enough,btohqsg
how did u use it ah btw,btohqsg
But like the way it is written,btohqsg
Either as part of the opening paragraph aft intro  or towards the end,btohqsg
Wait I got do papers however like do for doing,btohqsg
I never see oh where I wrong I want to complete,btohqsg
99.5% of jp ppl who get 60 rp will nvr hit 88.75/90 at a lvls,btohqsg
No i dont (even if i did is illegal here),btohqsg
So like wasting my own time only doing complete bollocks,btohqsg
which gp teacher is best one ah,btohqsg
Is it the war vet lololol,btohqsg
btw how do u study for h2 chem,btohqsg
I just spent a week hardcore mugging aft j1 promos during holidays,btohqsg
Then i remembered all my content for j1,btohqsg
And barely revised j1 stuff in j2,btohqsg
Everyday if i sleep in class my gp percentile is between 99 to 100% means something wrong alr,btohqsg
Tbf gp standard in jp is not very high in the sense that people like,btohqsg
they want to get a D and then go party on,btohqsg
Is not high for a reason also,btohqsg
The students cant keep up with it,btohqsg
Like if i make the paper 1% harder  fail rates will exponentially soar,btohqsg
btw got take notes in the gp lecs? I never do anything leh,btohqsg
Hence the gp department is not so good,btohqsg
I just sleep or do my own homework/revision,btohqsg
The lecs a bit like nothing make no sense to me,btohqsg
Ya they tell the info and things it's a bit no brainer,btohqsg
I think it helps a bit for students who are strugglin with GP,btohqsg
Not no brainer I mean like,btohqsg
I got my own set of data I got from somewhere else,btohqsg
Are you from JP? Or else how do you  know so much?,btohqsg
lol promo rp is out of 80,btohqsg
i was from the non-merged jc,btohqsg
but most of the teachers stayed on,btohqsg
Quite obvious that it is PJC from your previous responses,btohqsg
so free to CSI me ah haha,btohqsg
bell curve must be too gentle for you,btohqsg
I have already given up. Hahaha,btohqsg
considerin this sem is mostly CA mods? So last minute doing well can pull up overall,btohqsg
Because the whole situation is depressing? I'm doomed,btohqsg
but if u are not extremely to the left of the curve  and just below the peak  shld still be ok ba,btohqsg
oh so then my rp is 58.75 fml,btohqsg
I miss my 60 by 1 mark,btohqsg
And my bio pick wrong essay B to D woke,btohqsg
i mean just prepare all the standard qns?,btohqsg
Remember  I'm not in a Singapore uni.They are super inflexible. I applied to get my mid term test result waived due to medical reasons. But I don't know what is taking them so long to decide  but one of the modules got approved. So now my final exam for at least one of the modules is a high stakes exam,btohqsg
ur tutor prob ask ur grp to do somethin liddat up,btohqsg
but in the end  the qn that i got wasn't even a standard qn,btohqsg
'What aspects of your project work can other groups learn from?',btohqsg
ÁßòÂØÜ. But I also quit another uni and started all over again  or else I'd might have already graduated.Seeing your former classmates leave uni is not a nice sight.,btohqsg
Interesting... I thought more people would choose definitely not,btohqsg
? What are you asking about specifically?,btohqsg
Dissatisfied with the environment and the path that they are leading you to.I joined that uni because of ranking and because they accepted me. But I left. That's why I am not really obssessed with rankings anymore,btohqsg
she say its actl because of the noise of the waves,btohqsg
i got 23 or smth for this,btohqsg
where did the leaders come from tho,btohqsg
i forget my 7-12 answers alr,btohqsg
i think my part 2 full marks eh,btohqsg
so shud be 25 or smth,btohqsg
the last part of the q26 idk eh,btohqsg
heng the speakers part i correk,btohqsg
i think i just scrap through lol,btohqsg
i wrote down all the reasons in all the 4 speakers,btohqsg
then i cancel out one by one,btohqsg
