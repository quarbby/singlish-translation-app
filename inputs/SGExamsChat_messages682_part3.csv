- paper on some music analysis topic- one specific orchestral piece is assigned to us that we basically need to know the ins and outs (mine was like a 1 hour concerto)- aural tests (both classical western music + CO + gamalan + indian/japanese music)- composition where we get a poem and compose music to it and have to record it to be sent- practical (2 solo pieces and 1 duet/ensemble),btohqsg

So yall still technically had it easier than the new batch of J1s. They still have to pass pw to get into a local uni,btohqsg
But if like the new pass is equivalent to grade E and above  then should be almost impossible to fail,btohqsg
Tbf  it was the first time the subject was rolled out  and teachers weren‚Äôt sure how to administer it igI remember very vividly that my group proposed something that my tutor rejected flatly with the comment ‚Äúit was not technically viable‚Äù. And that solution is currently all over Singapore haha. I do laugh about that with my group mates,btohqsg

I was in a school which was only served by 2 (or 3) buses at the front gate and bus frequency was horribleWe proposed having the electronic boards to show bus arrival time so that students could decide to wait for the bus or walk to the MRT station instead,btohqsg
