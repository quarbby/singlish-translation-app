The tech and materials are really good  I don't think anything in that price bracket and segment is close to it,btohqsg
Mild hybrid tech is also very smooth,btohqsg
A friend of mine was able to get a realistic figure of 14 to 15km/l,btohqsg
You can also consider the Kia cerato as a middle ground between the Altis and the Mazda 3. Really good balance offered in terms of quality and tech with that too. Good price as well,btohqsg
did't look at Kia  but I did check on Avente,btohqsg
Very similar actually  I just prefer the design language on the cerato. Slightly cheaper too,btohqsg
just the new Avente's look is too much to me,btohqsg
I think a good day out at Leng Kee will be beneficial. Can visit all 4 brands and look at the deals that they are offering,btohqsg
I agree  the avante is a bit polarising. Cerato is essentially the same car underneath but easier on the eyes,btohqsg
avante is very easy to spot at night.,btohqsg

Hiya all just hoping for some advice - does number of owner really affect resale value? Like if i am 4th owner.. next time want to trade in or sell will kena lowball alot?,btohqsg
trade in usually no effect at all. for own sale as direct owner can be a factor people will consider  you can consign instead as it gives buyers slightly more confidence than buying from a direct owner at times.,btohqsg
Trade in ADs only care for paper value and what you are buying  they will offer and over-trade above your paper value+body value. For used car dealers  they usually only care for the car condition and paper value as well,btohqsg
I use wireless android but charge using a fast speed charge.. my hu can only supply 1 or 1.5a. Too slow,btohqsg
Based on my recent selling experience. For direct sales you can also consider the SGCarMart auction sale  a bit more convenient than consigning if you would like that,btohqsg
GetGo adds the all-electric Ioniq 5 into its car sharing fleetGetGo will be adding the all-electric Ioniq 5 into its car sharing fleet  but initial models will only be available in Jurong West.West side best side?‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
Oh  so basically doesnt matter if im the 4th owner if i am going to trade in.. got it thanks very much for the advice!!,btohqsg
But if the car is like 6 years old ppl might think it an lemon,btohqsg
Yeah i thought so too  but can go own workshop to check if lemon before buying to ease worry?,btohqsg
Also depends on the reason for high owner count  sometimes high because of plate transfers. Others because car has passed through a group of friends who have enjoyed for short periods of time each.,btohqsg
but with a trade in or dealer sale  usually no issues. They buy and sell everyday and know how to tell if a car is a decent unit or not,btohqsg
At least most of them do,btohqsg
I usuallly buy car under wife name and when selling can use careful lady owner,btohqsg
I usually just have a plush toy just for this kind of situation. no need so complicated,btohqsg
I also got a lot of toys in the car,btohqsg
I even got some nice and cute sticker,btohqsg
women duno how to take care cars. put father's name better,btohqsg
