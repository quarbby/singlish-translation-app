Huh? U alr got an offer?,btohqsg
U are still a Year 1 rite?,btohqsg
Ok how do I say this kindly.,btohqsg
You most likely aren't gonna get a 4.0,btohqsg
bruh i start a new programme instantly got error,btohqsg
For STEM a 3.5 and above is something note worthy alr,btohqsg
i saw a breifing by my rp lecturers..they said that there were students getting into uni with 3.5,btohqsg
A lot of students in Y1 have that dream la,btohqsg
But it will die for 90% of them by Y2,btohqsg
its very tough to get 3.7+ in it for rp,btohqsg
I remember going in thinking of a 4.0 too lol,btohqsg
U ain't gonna tell me that,btohqsg
i mean for school of infocomn,btohqsg
will never be a 4 again ded,btohqsg
It's in Y2 when the dip starts.,btohqsg
U haven't got your first semester yet,btohqsg
A significant amount of ppl will drop out after the 1st and 2nd semester,btohqsg
And then only 1 idiot like me in Y3,btohqsg
You haven't get your GPA yet,btohqsg
That's why I say to just wait and don't count your eggs before they hatch,btohqsg
should i pay 20 bucks for new fish,btohqsg
No like I dropout in Y3,btohqsg
The only wanker who does so,btohqsg
By Y2S2 u passed the point of no return for most ppl,btohqsg
half of the ppl in my class are below 2,btohqsg
old fish 6 years just passed,btohqsg
my class right now got a average gpa of like 2.2,btohqsg
Yeah do u see how funny it is when Y1s said they want a 4.0 when u see that stat,btohqsg
Doesn't matter lol Y2S1 the amount decreases less for dropouts liao,btohqsg
Uni refers to AU or just Uni,btohqsg
Cuz some polys also count private unis too,btohqsg
But if it's AU then the number is skewed by SIT and SUSS,btohqsg
SIT accepts most of the poly grads that come out,btohqsg
you see the director role of honour you know alr,btohqsg
the higher the year..the lesser the ppl on it,btohqsg
Yeah but my point is Y1 Y2 decrease a lot Y2 Y3 very little change,btohqsg
In fact SIT is made for such purpose,btohqsg
70 - 80% of SIT cohort is poly grads,btohqsg
As usual tho the E skews the data,btohqsg
U are not understanding my point,btohqsg
NUS and NTU engineering have the lowest RP GPA requirements,btohqsg
Especially for NUS cuz CHS is a notorious killer,btohqsg
this is the best representation lmao,btohqsg
for soi  its Y2 to Y3 big difference,btohqsg
Y1 Y2 not much cause half the modules are simillar,btohqsg
past batches tried so hard for what...,btohqsg
Nabei if the 70rp system is now my s is ignored,btohqsg
YO SO PW NOT COUNTER ANYMORE AH,btohqsg
i thought pass would be 10rp or sth then fail 0rp,btohqsg
i have eyes lah can see lah,btohqsg
