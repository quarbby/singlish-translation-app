They hv been disappointing after Bad Company,btohqsg
Slowly play den just nice part 2 come out,btohqsg
the old school battlefield were damn good,btohqsg
but the current one just had too many glitches,btohqsg
But 1 thing excellent abt battlefield is their audio,btohqsg
CB time i asked for delivery,btohqsg
then 1 shot chiong within 1 week complete,btohqsg
morning to night no move from sofa,btohqsg
If u played the remake den the original is similar  just top view and pixilated,btohqsg

Even my ps5 oso collecting dust,btohqsg
The only playstation I had was a ps1 slim,btohqsg
Hahaha i sony fan boy... All oso have before except psp go,btohqsg
I have a Xbox one x... That is just a YouTube/Netflix player for my tv,btohqsg
Then most convenient way to make it smart  take the dusty Xbox,btohqsg
so i tell myself why need so much power,btohqsg
See how fast u can reach the next traffic light,btohqsg
but i would love to have a gtr,btohqsg
To be a flame thrower at rearüòÇ,btohqsg
sometimes i take blow torch melt marshmellow,btohqsg
honestly i tried before.. didnt like,btohqsg
but i scared i burn down the house,btohqsg
i bought a sous vide machine because of his videos,btohqsg
wanted to buy but sure will end up hardly use,btohqsg
but when i do use  the steak is perfect,btohqsg
damn  nv had sous vide steak before,btohqsg
u torch ur steak? or pan sear it,btohqsg
sous vide need seal the bag  troublesome,btohqsg
u need do 3 different steak den i come do taste test and guess,btohqsg
the vacuum sealer?  Cheap and good,btohqsg
but you can also do with a ziplock,btohqsg
what i like is  you can cook without even lighting the stove,btohqsg
i last time buy this steak de,btohqsg
for someone like me who can't cook shit  to be able to make steak and salmon its damn worth getting,btohqsg
high heat 1min each side can liao cos its thin,btohqsg
for the sous vide to work well  you need thick steaks,btohqsg
"i buy from ""mmmm"" at changi citi point",btohqsg
Last time make sio bak before,btohqsg
wapiang haven pk.. yall show all these,btohqsg
so the few things i can cook is steak  salmon  grilled fish,btohqsg
fish really the best one la  cheap  fast and people like it more,btohqsg
fish the hardest leh  easy to over or under cook,btohqsg
salmon easiest cos better to undercook it den over cook,btohqsg
wa nv try salt bake fish before,btohqsg
its damn easy  just buy the correct salt,btohqsg
but wasted the skin cannot eat,btohqsg
also the scale is left on  thats why can open like that,btohqsg
i will sous vide then blow torch,btohqsg
Very long nv make something like this liao.. Hahaha i show my friend they say which restaurant de,btohqsg
anything over a stove i cannot make it lol,btohqsg
so if i attempt to cook  is don't need skill  just time and temperature,btohqsg
salt bake fish  cheap and easy to do,btohqsg
but the first fish is to test temperature  2nd one usually better,btohqsg
instant noodles i also lazy to light the stove lol,btohqsg
just pour hot water then wait,btohqsg
u need boil water oso hahaha,btohqsg
i only cook when i decide to hold party  so its very seldom,btohqsg
next time u can try roast chicken and baby potatoes,btohqsg
u cut shortly after its done?,btohqsg
that time just bought the house so excited to use the kitchen,btohqsg
now i don't even stay there,btohqsg
haha  shd let it rest awhile before cutting so the juices can flow back ard the bird,btohqsg
Haha i think the rest all hungry liao,btohqsg
Oooh. Already playing sunbreak. The new mechanics are fun.,btohqsg
haven't played much of sunbreak yet,btohqsg
need to get in the gaming mood  sit infront of tv and play,btohqsg
I havent tried the new one yet. Enjoying gunlance too much,btohqsg
Have a literal ‚Äúlet go everything‚Äù skill,btohqsg
i tried to like other weapons but always go back to the long sword,btohqsg
Long sword was OP in part 1,btohqsg
They gave other weapons a fighting chance now,btohqsg
the problem is finding a gunner,btohqsg
gunner's are essential but you can't really solo,btohqsg
Long sword easiest to solo but u have to focus up for 15 minutes,btohqsg
in the older version i loved the valstrax armour,btohqsg
haha the long sword is white all the way,btohqsg
Now got purple liao. The valstrax doesnt go purple i find it morally wrong,btohqsg
How can they not let it have purple,btohqsg
i need to play more mh rise,btohqsg
i stopped i think in june last year,btohqsg
The MR grind is abit annoying,btohqsg
But the story is pretty cool,btohqsg
but its fun when got kaki to play with,btohqsg
used to have few friends will connect on discord and play,btohqsg
Yea back when PSP  few ppl gather and play was fun,btohqsg
online i like because i can play on the tv,btohqsg
Thats a switch thing tho haha,btohqsg
i don't really like to play it hand held,btohqsg
i need to put the grip on if i play hand held,btohqsg
next time you got place must have sofa and tv to play game,btohqsg
Hahaa yup and i got own gaming room for my pc,btohqsg
i need to build a gaming pc,btohqsg
now just on laptop then everything external,btohqsg
U can get laptop den get those external GPU,btohqsg
yeah i have the egpu  time for a newer gpu,btohqsg
Can be portable outsids den come home game,btohqsg
laptop has a 2060  but not comfortable running it so hot,btohqsg
Now gpu drop price a fair bit,btohqsg
Laptop will always run hot cos dont have good cooling,btohqsg
maybe once the new call of duty comes out,btohqsg
U mean the old call of duty,btohqsg
everything now oso remake... no idea liao sell old games,btohqsg
but cold war i didn't like it,btohqsg
modern warfare is the only good one,btohqsg
dont like those old or futuristic type,btohqsg
as long they set a delay on sniper scopes  i don't like the game,btohqsg
but like nowadays dont like fps anymore... bought far cry 6 end up nv play,btohqsg
i love how the old cs 1.6 awp shoots,btohqsg
tried once play with friend at lan  2mins later i play my own game,btohqsg
tats my one and only time at lan,btohqsg
end up playing operation flashpoint with bots alone,btohqsg
lan gaming was like childhood good times,btohqsg
the games i play  most ppl here dont play one,btohqsg
these days lazy to game anymore,btohqsg
once cold war came out... really nonsense,btohqsg
ya cold war and battlefield was a waste of money,btohqsg
mw iirc during cb  really invest alot of hours. then cw came out  is shit already,btohqsg
it was a really good timing with covid,btohqsg

Bf4 is the last good one imo,btohqsg
Bf1 maybe actually ok but i prefer modern,btohqsg
The last one I properly played was bad company,btohqsg
The BR was also fun to play unti coldwar came out and the weapons all became OP,btohqsg

Patches that came out always is to nerf this nerf that,btohqsg

How am i gonna go lunch,btohqsg
EH HOW AM I GONNA GO LUNCH,btohqsg

I got lunch at home. So not going out,btohqsg
And I already passed@hayleescdoffice earlier to water jet,btohqsg
I dont believe in speakers amd shit,btohqsg
I dont need speaker  i need exos,btohqsg
Must be some top range one,btohqsg
I don't use android auto or carplay,btohqsg
I just need a fucking place to have maps,btohqsg
My car no place to mount phone,btohqsg
Have you tried the one mount on your rear mirror,btohqsg
I dont want things to be obstructing view,btohqsg
Android auto wasn't that great for me,btohqsg
It spans from top to bottom of my windshield,btohqsg
So went with a full android,btohqsg
I tried dash taped on one,btohqsg
Cos my dash very curved downwards,btohqsg
I tried 3 aircon vents mount,btohqsg
Why don't go for Android ones,btohqsg
1 wont fit cos circle vents,btohqsg
It worked well but got some flaws,btohqsg
The carplay dongle idk why i plug in,btohqsg
Nvm i use the built in map,btohqsg
I dont want to mount it on my dash cos i hate wires and random boxes lying around,btohqsg
You use the pioneer need to plug cable to the phone right,btohqsg
My phone is an issue la  i even tried to use those mount put infront of speedo,btohqsg
But my phone blocks entire gauge cluster,btohqsg
Then i really dk wat to do alr,btohqsg
But recently someone intro me CD slot mount,btohqsg
I nv knew it existed if not i'd try,btohqsg
That time I just throw my phone onto passenger seat,btohqsg
Alot of times i holding in my hands,btohqsg
but 1 thing i definitely will miss on android,btohqsg
i always stream stuff while i drive,btohqsg
Later I try my Android auto see what shows up,btohqsg
Been thinking how to link my phone to my Android wirelessly,btohqsg
I thought is see the HU can support wireless or not one,btohqsg
I am fine with cable la,btohqsg
if not is just chuck into the glove box,btohqsg
i mean it's mostly data transfer mode ma,btohqsg
Haven't tried plugging my phone to the android to see what happens,btohqsg
I have both pioneer and android in mine,btohqsg
Yep the whole middle dashboard all screensü§£ü•≤,btohqsg
Can watch f1 race when never make it home,btohqsg
"""Tesla style"" is what it's advertised on",btohqsg
Next time can dont pay singtel alr,btohqsg
Hit and miss la  but when you desperate it's all you got,btohqsg
If I can I always watch at home,btohqsg
My car cannot even watch anything,btohqsg
And you have the newest among us,btohqsg
They put the price so high but like that,btohqsg
your HU not stock one meh,btohqsg
Please give me the money this week,btohqsg
I actually vote HU over coils,btohqsg
the stock HU is good enough la. Got android auto,btohqsg
So that i can enjoy coils for a week before i go to back to back surgerh,btohqsg
On the road i am dying no way,btohqsg
I see lorry going so comfy on the road than me while i bouncing,btohqsg
then you put coils you die,btohqsg
Accord where got lighter than civic,btohqsg
Why does it sound do heated,btohqsg
Your life is just going to get more uncomfy,btohqsg
Our boy here thinks coils more comfort than stock suspension,btohqsg
but it also means more vibrations,btohqsg
We call it ‚Äúroad feel‚Äù to make ourselves less sad,btohqsg
We never drive over humps or strips that day,btohqsg
not bouncing cos your dampers dont work,btohqsg
It's bouncing cos our roads so fucking rough,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21you drive a go kart alr,btohqsg
so you'll know how a car on coilovers will feel,btohqsg
The only thing that cushions you is your seats,btohqsg
Most comfort is BC.. Bery Comfortable,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21u want a cross between comfort and handling?,btohqsg
Actually my friend's car using mitin  he says mine feels too hard,btohqsg
Stock you can go over humps and not worry,btohqsg
Wheeee got we went through so many humps amd even Zheng Jie the carpark,btohqsg
But on a side note coilover may still be more comfortable than some stock shock with lowering springs,btohqsg
Stock shocks lower can be very harsh n bouncy,btohqsg
Coilover like what I'm using is stiffer  more firm. So on flat road it feels nicer. But humps  strips  etc really need to slow down,btohqsg
cos the dampers not stiff enough,btohqsg
So if stock I rather stay stock,btohqsg
Just know that coilovers wont be absorbing bumps as much,btohqsg
U gain something u lose something too,btohqsg
U want swee swee comfort sure become -,btohqsg
To put into perspective  over strips  a picanto will run circles around me,btohqsg
if your spring rates go up  it'll become harder to compress,btohqsg
hence it's gonna be stiffer too,btohqsg
That why cheapest way to lower,btohqsg
He can put the bc on and set to the softest,btohqsg
Then Abt 2 to 3 weeks later adjust harder if he wants stiffer,btohqsg
knn need remove all the shit in boot,btohqsg
U saying for the past dk how many weeks alr üòà,btohqsg
Let ppl go do the job,btohqsg
My friend showed me where to unbolt in the back seat but I lazy to do,btohqsg
Mine still relatively easy compared to yours,btohqsg
is just remove plastic trims in boot,btohqsg
I need to unbolt the cushion,btohqsg
Bcv1 I know need to go under the car to adjust the rear,btohqsg
the adjustment bolt is bbottom one ah,btohqsg
depends on car to car too,btohqsg
This is why i hate black rims,btohqsg
But it looks like advan RGs,btohqsg
But the red words on centercaps like rays,btohqsg
So maybe is a rays gramlights copy,btohqsg
Thats because the dampers were made for X amount of travel,btohqsg
When u cut the travel without adjusting damper its not optimal at all,btohqsg
