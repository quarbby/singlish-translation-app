U look at their Covid response,btohqsg
He technically still has control of thr military so...,btohqsg
Ahh yess my imaginary illegal vote,btohqsg
I will hv u know that i voted from sg,btohqsg
Because the greatest generation and silent generation actually knew how to live good lives,btohqsg
Everything went to the pits with the baby boomers and afterwards,btohqsg
And hard times create strong men,btohqsg
Guess covid 19 will turn us all into big strong men then,btohqsg
And you know  pouring billions into their military every year,btohqsg
Isnt it trillions or was that the cost of iraq war,btohqsg
They have monopoly over the USD,btohqsg
They print USD like no body's business,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAH im in trillion dollars of debt? In USD?,btohqsg
Im in debt in my own currency?,btohqsg
he is judt learning from weimar germany,btohqsg
No matter how much they print or r in debt,btohqsg
No one can touch the US,btohqsg
No if China rrly wanted to fuck US up,btohqsg
They could just ask for all its debt back,btohqsg
But i dun like biden cos i think he is too soft spoken alr,btohqsg
"Like china will say surrender the country now and he will be like ""ok""",btohqsg
At least he has the balls to stand up to china,btohqsg
"""i want all my loans back""",btohqsg
His approach to china may not br the best but at least its gg somewhere,btohqsg
"""I want the entirety of California""""okay""",btohqsg
The us economy will literally be deccimated,btohqsg
Sounds rllu weird but we honestly nvr know what china is up to,btohqsg
Just look at the sg guy paid by china to spy out the us govt,btohqsg
Not too surprised happens all the time,btohqsg
I like the choice of words,btohqsg
But US literally getting EVERYONE to gang on china,btohqsg
South korea and japan are all for it,btohqsg
I only know belt and road initiative,btohqsg
Even though it was completely unnecessary,btohqsg
But we will cfm be badly affected if it happens,btohqsg
We become a third world country,btohqsg
We still heavily rely on ports,btohqsg
Back to 1965 but this time there is no way out,btohqsg
You wont even need to go to school anymore,btohqsg
So they didnt come to an agreement,btohqsg
Was it Thailand? Idk i forgot,btohqsg
Half of africa is china's dog,btohqsg
Like china doesnt expect them to repay debts,btohqsg
But expects them to basically be indirectly colonised,btohqsg
But if u ask me honestly idt hong kong has any way out,btohqsg
Even if they hold out for long enough the agreement to be returned to china still remains,btohqsg
They will still become communist in any case,btohqsg
Esp when i speak the dialect,btohqsg
The only reason why US supported them is cos they wanted to use it as an opporrunity to destabalise china,btohqsg
Nothing to do with democracy or anything,btohqsg
Malaysia proceeds to literally blockade us,btohqsg
I mean it would cause a lot of political problems for Thailand since the part they cut off might try to fight for independence,btohqsg
Great its NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN,btohqsg
And its gg to stay that way,btohqsg
If it happens within these few years,btohqsg
Unless we can find some other source to depend on,btohqsg
They used to have âœ¨ crossword puzzles âœ¨,btohqsg
This is 2002 o lvl paper,btohqsg
I have the one for a math,btohqsg

anyone got tips for h2 computing theory,btohqsg
H2 Literature Paper 2/3 kids  how's it going?,btohqsg
I'm studying paper 3 (Woolf  Woman) and my tutor just can't teach so we're on our own,btohqsg
;-;;; I take h1 lit so im done with my papers but atb yo the paper should be quite doable!!!,btohqsg
thanks!! Yea lit is okay  I'm more worried about my econs,btohqsg
ohh I see h2 or h1??,btohqsg
finished with h1 math and gp  lit paper 1 was ok,btohqsg
Instructions unclearEnded up destroying my laptop instead,btohqsg
I see....The old fight fire with fire tatic,btohqsg
Tfw not enough people take h2 cpu to give advice,btohqsg
kinds curious what does h2 cpu do,btohqsg
I just finished 1 year of it and i honestly have no clue myself,btohqsg
We learnt some python some html,btohqsg
Theory honestly half of it is intuitive,btohqsg
Thats why im kinda worried my sch paprrs and qns arent of a lvl standard cause i havent seen other schs papers,btohqsg
Ur teachers don't get yall prelim papers or smth??,btohqsg
Anyone good in python? Do plotting of graphs? And modeling curves?,btohqsg
no but you can try looking up libraries   i know matplotlib is a library that is used for plotting of graphs  histograms  etc..,btohqsg
Spent your 4 years in NUS computing well I see,btohqsg
i can actually print hello world in 15 different languages,btohqsg
I can write hello world on paper,btohqsg
Define good.Plotting graph  yesModeling curve q rusty.,btohqsg
Anyone can share h2 chem p3 possible topics,btohqsg
What wasn't tested for H2 Chem P2 and may be tested for P3:Chemical Bonding- strength of imf in affecting melting/boiling points  solubility... orbital overlaps and bond angles were not tested at allIdeal gas- eqns and kinetic theory of gases  gas laws  deviation from idealityKinetics - Although some part of it came out  rate eqn and using botlzman distribution graph to explain why rate changes when Temp changes or use of catalyst was not testedThermodynamics- Q specifically on entropy change did not come out and definitions for enthalpies too  energy level diagrams or energy cycles was not specifically tested so it may come out  eqn relating delta G H and S tooChemical and solubility eqm-Kc Kp and Ksp was not tested so likely to come out in P3. The use of LCP was not tested too.Acid-base eqm-Although Ka Kb and basicity of amines/amides came out  there was no q on buffers so may still want to revise on that partElectrochem- was quite extensively tested but can be asked on again in terms of LCP or calculation based on current for electrolysisOrganic chem:Isomerism was not tested at allDrawing of Reaction mechanisms were not tested at allInductive/resonance effects/steric hindrance were not tested too  Explaining relative acidities and basicities of other diff grps  organic synthesis on ur own  hybridisationStructural elucidation can come out with use of new rxn(similar to in 2019)Distinguishing testsFor nitrogen compounds  may not ask abt amino acids but possibly amines their relative basicityPeriodic table- barely touched upon with a few parts on Al. Thus might ask abt period 3  group 2 and 17 and their trends and propertiesAtomic structure: 3m on shielding effect and ENC was asked  drawing of orbitals and angles of deflection in an E field was not testedWith that said  some of the same concepts may be tested again esp for organic chem in terms of reagents and conditions for other types of reaction,btohqsg
I can import data from ASCII files in respective rows and columns only,btohqsg
What is everyone doing now.What to do if bored,btohqsg
U are done with ur exams?,btohqsg
Not interested. Give me free also dun wan,btohqsg
Curious cause idk what JC offers computing,btohqsg

i dont intend to go there or to jc for that matter so i dont pay much attention to stuff,btohqsg
Does anyone know if we have to actually come to collect our O level results next year? The newspaper article said that we could do it online but my teacher said no,btohqsg
U shd be able to get it online but can choose to get in person too without ur parents though,btohqsg
Thank you  I guess I'll be collecting online then since I dont want to see my teacher expression when they see it,btohqsg
my teacher said that we hv to go down to sch to collect,btohqsg
"moe said ""to give students an opportunity to be with their classmates"" which pissed the hell outta me",btohqsg
If u dont want your 1 in the only world unique physical copy of your cert  by all means,btohqsg
my class fails the vibe check i swear,btohqsg

Yes. I dont want L1R5>25 on my unique cert. Thank you for agreeing with me,btohqsg
Are you ready for school then,btohqsg
Idk when ite school term starts but,btohqsg

Imagine if we get all A2s,btohqsg
As a great man once said It is what it is,btohqsg
Then go to ACJC for computing,btohqsg
But if you have the work ethic of a scholar... I think polytechnic is an easier route to becoming one,btohqsg
4.0 GPA is probably easier than 90 RP,btohqsg
He say to u nt me eh,btohqsg
Even all A1 doesnâ€™t guarantee RI lol,btohqsg
