I saw this insta post abt how netflix shows us shows and movies based on where we are and they said to use vpn if we wanna watch other shows,btohqsg
idk about downloading but u can use the website movieorca,btohqsg
i watch dankpods for the memes,btohqsg
Is there anyone who learned python here?,btohqsg

Must be smth wrong w the write up haiz,btohqsg
"actually cant find the place to reset the ""learned words""",btohqsg
oh wtf need cca for scholarship?,btohqsg
wtf i was planning to not join cca,btohqsg
ya bond-free usually need perfect gpa for poly,btohqsg

guess i have to manually remove them one by one,btohqsg
Last time study smart can alr,btohqsg
is thre any non-sports cca thats vv slack?,btohqsg
Well lemme check n get back to u,btohqsg
u dont have to be in a sports cca anyway,btohqsg

i found those people who wanted leadership positions only for leap points really annoying ngl,btohqsg
When people r too book smart they up the difficulty by including ccas,btohqsg
i mean  unless ur frm a competitve sport cca yes,btohqsg
not the people themselves are annoyingthey want the positions only for leaps is annoying,btohqsg
Idk if many ppl have CCA achievements what would moe resort to next,btohqsg
lmao then guess not even joining cca,btohqsg
Uk those students who volunteer this volunteer that,btohqsg
Man  you sure love using the clown emojiVery insightful. Totally changed my perspective on the matter,btohqsg
Then they keep all the opportunities for themselves,btohqsg
Eh but back to ur original concern,btohqsg
If u want bond-free then ur acads need to be almost perfect/perfect + have a CCA,btohqsg
If u have no CCA then pretty much ur chance is lowered for all scholarship types,btohqsg
U dont need cca leadership positions,btohqsg
Ya but what i c are those chair ppl,btohqsg
I resort to joining other cca,btohqsg

Tbh this sem is more fun for me,btohqsg
Cos more of my mods are physical,btohqsg
Just that I wish I was doing better lol,btohqsg
It's everything I live for now,btohqsg
Covid == nothing to do == only study at home,btohqsg
eh anyone crazy bout bikes here can pm me gimme some advice thanks,btohqsg
Better things to ride in life,btohqsg
Like riding high on deans list,btohqsg
but I only know abt road bikes,btohqsg
i was thinking whether i should get those gear and brakes tgt thingy  what do you think?,btohqsg
you mean road bike gear shifters?,btohqsg
what kinda bike u have now,btohqsg
actually are dropbars or bullhorns better?,btohqsg
what kind of bike do u ride now though,btohqsg
dropbars got the most hand position options,btohqsg
bull horn is basically all positions are the same height,btohqsg
just whether pronated or neutral grip,btohqsg
if u ride on the road definitely get drop bars,btohqsg
I don't think road bike shifters mount well to bullhorns,btohqsg
i honestly have bad knowledge of bikes,btohqsg
then honestly..... get a bike that fits your needs from the start,btohqsg
cos bike parts not cheap in sg either...,btohqsg
so idek what kind of bike im using :>,btohqsg
cos I buy and sell them last time ahahahha,btohqsg
like if u want new handlebars and shifters,btohqsg
it's easily 30 bucks for handlebars and 50 for shifters,btohqsg
and that's for low end alr,btohqsg
so might as well buy a brand new bike from decathlon for 400-500,btohqsg
i intend to just get like bullhorn extenders,btohqsg
so not like the whole handlebar,btohqsg
what kind of riding do u do?,btohqsg
and what makes you feel like changing it up?,btohqsg
i thot you got alot of shit to do?,btohqsg
no time for your study group?,btohqsg
Lala lala lala lala Elmo’s World,btohqsg
I honestly dm  cycling is my transport and exercise combined,btohqsg
is only human to take a breather,btohqsg
all? normal daily life  dirt track and maybe road in future,btohqsg
then I say don't make any upgrades to your current bike,btohqsg
just save and upgrade your whole bike,btohqsg
meanwhile learn how to look through togoparts and carousell for bargains,btohqsg
I spent many hours looking through carousel for deals last time,btohqsg
I've nvr bought anything new (other than tyres and tubes),btohqsg
every thing second hand from togoparts and carousell,btohqsg
i legit damn tempted to get bullhorns tho,btohqsg
then get the extenders thingy I gues,btohqsg
this can be because of so many different things,btohqsg
but brakes/gears i think no need hor?,btohqsg
cuz i too used to the shimano one,btohqsg
i forgot how to use the normal one that most bikes have,btohqsg
I think normal u referring to is friction shifters,btohqsg
which is u press then it auto change for u,btohqsg
how to change gear with that one?,btohqsg
u literally need to manually push the lever until your chain aligns with the gear lor,btohqsg
ehhhh idk  I've not used a friction shifter in so long,btohqsg
just change the gear shifter right?,btohqsg
like i dont change the gears,btohqsg
but u need to watch out for the compatibility also ah,btohqsg
but i use the shimano shifter,btohqsg
depends on what kind of derailleurs u have,btohqsg
how much is it to change the whole gear tho?,btohqsg
like the gear shifters plus derailleur,btohqsg
haizz i think i go bike shop ask the uncle if can just change shifter,btohqsg
cuz i aso need get mud guard,btohqsg
cuz my bro wan go dirt,btohqsg
idk I just decathlon everything now lol,btohqsg
cuz my bro got his for $18,btohqsg
but i scared i pick wrong size,btohqsg
It was on the bike but i blind,btohqsg
Can't help only know how to deal w fixie-,btohqsg
Anyone here registered for lower sec elementz before but didn’t get in? If so did you get LEAP points?,btohqsg

and this year mostly 1 paper one day for most so more chill lol 🤣,btohqsg
your entry proof come out alr ?,btohqsg
depends on your sub combi also,btohqsg
lol end ard the same tho,btohqsg
thats why i say most haha,btohqsg
not sure exactly which part you changed since there's a lot that goes into the transmission but 45 isn't too much for bicycle stuff .. say you use your bike daily for 3 months that's only 50c every day :),btohqsg
o u change the rear derailleur ah?,btohqsg
wah I realise that decathlon bike parts is hella cheap,btohqsg
And i suck at using it anyways,btohqsg
Like cuz each school have 3 teams to send,btohqsg
Like submit form and brief introduction of the project,btohqsg
If u not participating Idt u will get any pts,btohqsg
Like the school give us a form that is sent to the elementz committee for judgement,btohqsg
Oh I'm not too sure. I participated 2 years ago and we just went for the event.,btohqsg
Oh participated like represent ur school,btohqsg
Yea last time got showcase but now covid 19 so probably dont have,btohqsg
U had to present ur project to the judges right,btohqsg
Wait do u mean u got participation award?,btohqsg
Depends cuz like idk if they count participating in the registering representing school,btohqsg
So u represented ur sch and went thru judging?,btohqsg
No right now it’s registering phase,btohqsg
So like the school will choose 3 teams,btohqsg
Oh I think u need to go thru judging,btohqsg
For u to get any leap points,btohqsg
But I'm not too sure I think u shd ask ur teacher,btohqsg
Just remind ur teacher after the competition to add it into ur cca record,btohqsg
If never participatr like be there at the compeititon  dont ask them  might look bad on u thag u want ads stuff to ur cca record that u did not attend for example,btohqsg
as long as you turn up for event you should get participation points,btohqsg
In fact  lets give everyone a trophy for being born,btohqsg

My mum wanted a manly  masculine man for her firstborn son.She got the human equivalent of a chonky cat.,btohqsg

ok so you're a masculine man uwu,btohqsg
@gracennggI'm going to delete your post because this isn't the place to ask for this,btohqsg
Eh but tbh idk how these scams work,btohqsg
I mean what did the person send anyway,btohqsg
She asked for one more pax for netflix,btohqsg
Idk for what  maybe to buy?,btohqsg
Chey this one not scam la,btohqsg
She always looking for ppl to share netflix hahaha,btohqsg
shows that she's a broke lady,btohqsg
I mean if someone just joins and posts a link  I'm immediately suspicious,btohqsg
Eh but you should do with a fake number ngl,btohqsg
If got scam u scam back,btohqsg
I dunno cos they are using fake numbers as well,btohqsg
That makes u a scammer too,btohqsg
the person blue tick alsoOmg HAHA,btohqsg
I mean they won't fall for it so...,btohqsg
Dun mess with people who take ss,btohqsg
They will type u a whole para,btohqsg
Usually I call them if they don't reply for some time,btohqsg
Call but when they pick up  don't talk,btohqsg
Sql set number active = true kekw,btohqsg
There's a trick where if you're confident,btohqsg
You can speak to them and tell them fake details about yourself very softly,btohqsg
Its how u get more scam msgs tho,btohqsg
And then blow an airhorn at the right moment,btohqsg
like ask u for phone number and bank card,btohqsg
I mean it's petty revenge but whatever,btohqsg
Then my bank card number 12345678910,btohqsg
But if it's too obvious they hang up,btohqsg
There are those with the chinese voice saying they are from the police also,btohqsg

Ni hao do u simp for maxiaotiao,btohqsg
I've been thinking how to mess with scammers,btohqsg
But it's hard cos it's over the phone,btohqsg
I mean those will just annoy them,btohqsg
We like to call back and scream in the phone,btohqsg
There needs to be real consequences for scamming people,btohqsg
Like some way to find out their identity or smth,btohqsg
U annoy them with long para,btohqsg
Ure on the assumption that they actually read it all haha,btohqsg
turn on creepy music  or rickroll them,btohqsg
or smash ur phone on ur bed,btohqsg
I could try  but the charging port is too small♪~ ᕕ(ᐛ)ᕗ,btohqsg
"they want you to ""claim"" free Netflixlike family price or somethingthen they ask for your bank details .. and you never get the Netflix",btohqsg

sending to two groups won't get you help faster,btohqsg
It’s equal to half the area of the rectangle actually,btohqsg
The top triangles have common height... when you add the areas up  you actually get 1/2 x common height x total base length,btohqsg
Bottom triangles have common height 2. Adding them up  1/2 x common height 2 x total base length,btohqsg
Common height 1 + common height 2 = width of rectangle,btohqsg
If u split the rectangles into different parts where each triangle is half of the part it is in  u will see that it is half f the entire rectangle,btohqsg
Economics is about making decisions so maybe try applying what you learnt?,btohqsg
Guys if a programme i’m supposed to go for didn’t let me enter because i was late  should i go watch a film instead?,btohqsg
