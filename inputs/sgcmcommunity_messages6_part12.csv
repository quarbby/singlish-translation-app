So far I'm enjoying it. Previously on helix  Royal purple and redline I must say castrol is just as good haha not sure cause fresh oil after 10k,btohqsg
Ah nice I'll probably stick to this next 10k or maybe wanna try liquimoly,btohqsg

https://www.facebook.com/groups/sgroadshallofshame/permalink/2284835941663902/This one really remove doors lol,btohqsg
Toyotas are priced ridiculously vs the competiton,btohqsg
No door is called Coupe ah? I tot lightstrike vehicle sia LOL,btohqsg
Actually thet car is good and the depreciation is ok,btohqsg
U see some brand car lose money like Siao when sold for the first 3 year,btohqsg
Now any car also chao chao 10+k depre lol,btohqsg
For 2nd hand but what I mean is u look at the 1st hand price compare to 2nd hand   some car really don‚Äôt hold value well,btohqsg
Hmmm True thats why for the 2nd hand cars due to the depre also some rather get a conti than other mades. Plus now COE hitting 6digit lol. For the next decade cui.,btohqsg
So cars to me like Toyota can buy 1 at hand as value hold well hehe,btohqsg
Are you sure it‚Äôs the conti that holds value,btohqsg
You have to look at the reputation of the make first,btohqsg
Not talking about holding value in this sentence rather is about if u wanna spend on a Conti or JDM for example,btohqsg
I think car model is more relevant,btohqsg
I used to have a camry. Loved it. Before that I didn't like Toyota simply because of the name. I preferred Mitsubishi.,btohqsg
Don't like American ones. Possibly not even Tesla.,btohqsg
How many out there can hold thier value with a steady market with buyers,btohqsg
Bro  no brainer question. Of course road users have to give way,btohqsg
I will always pre empt‚Ä¶ if I see cyclist or pedestrian from a dist  I check to see if they are crossing,btohqsg
Sometimes they just suddenly increase their speed to cross the road  u won‚Äôt know,btohqsg
Feel like the car did slow down  but I think is more to check whether the pedestrian on the right is crossing‚Ä¶ fail to check his left.,btohqsg
When I'm a pedestrian I feel bad when a car slows down for me. Because if we continue at the same pace  I would reach the crossing only after the car has passed.,btohqsg
There are different kinds of pedestrians‚Ä¶ some dash to cross‚Ä¶ some cross like empress dowager,btohqsg
How's your new cunti car? Humble as usual sir@ic3l3mont3a,btohqsg
See little kids on bike be careful lol,btohqsg
Have u gone to automart to take ur photo?,btohqsg
French  Italian(certain make)  Germans(certain make) and even Americans made cars residual values aren‚Äôt fantastic.,btohqsg
Resale market demands are probably Low for these made of cars  to the exception of Mercs and BMWs,btohqsg
It's a liability mate. Expect to lose money for it  that's it,btohqsg
Nonsense. This is not the case for our@ic3l3mont3a,btohqsg
Maybe later abit gotta work today LOL,btohqsg
Need to dress nicely  take nice photo  and post here,btohqsg
Why do I read your message as saying: because a conti depreciation in the 2nd hand mkt is usually same or lower than Toyota/Honda‚Ä¶.pple prefer to buy 2nd hand Conti? Hahah (when new: assume conti more expensive than Japanese),btohqsg
