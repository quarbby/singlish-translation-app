My eczema got so bad just from walking from tamp hub to tamp mrt,btohqsg

like js a small carpark road,btohqsg
HALFWAY I CROSS CB I CNT SEE,btohqsg
bruh i kenna before traffic light turn pink,btohqsg
no kidding...i legit saw pink not red,btohqsg
the protestors getting more brazen alr...talk about france being a holiday hotspot,btohqsg
Eh legit eh while I crossing road,btohqsg
Has anyone received their NUS Grad offer letter?,btohqsg
Yes  this is what is happening in France,btohqsg
there are better places in Europe than Paris,btohqsg
the french rly love protesting / strike / work action like past time,btohqsg
it’s like their version of clubbing and drinking,btohqsg
any poly ppl want to join our study group on YPT to grind tgt,btohqsg
let’s motivate each other and do well tgt,btohqsg
id even know how it works,btohqsg
anybody planning to study in australia?,btohqsg
i really cant find a reason why anybody would want to leave sg,btohqsg
protests here..strikes there  next thing you know got no medical service...because workers are underpaid and decide to not work,btohqsg
i mean if you were to really take into consideration...are there countries out there that is as stable as sg?,btohqsg
Honestly  unless you got family...its really unthinkable to travel,btohqsg
like I said ppl got various reasons why they wld like to leave sg,btohqsg
bruh i read about the south korean mayor that got kidnapped,btohqsg
yea i understand that point  just found it a intresting topic,btohqsg
if uw peace   js move to a countryside area,btohqsg
i can nvr understand why ppl beat the police,btohqsg
who r just doing their jobs,btohqsg
they are dissatisfied with the govt,btohqsg
tbh   the French govt is no saint. many ppl hate Macron,btohqsg
since he wna stay in power for the second term   ig this is what he gets indirectly & he gotta gave it,btohqsg
but the police cant do anything abt the govt what,btohqsg
I mean they are deployed to manage the protests,btohqsg
so since they can’t show the anger on Macron   they do it on the police,btohqsg
let me tell u   this protest have smth to do with Covid as well,btohqsg
it isn’t as simple as u think as it is,btohqsg
citizens pay taxes to the govt,btohqsg
only for the citizens to end up whacking the police,btohqsg
Macron was one of those who implemented the no jab no job those sort of policies that made him unpopular,btohqsg
coupled   with the pension issues   the citizens rly had enough so now the protest have seem to be exploded,btohqsg
Imagine studying law...and this is the bs you come up with,btohqsg
I’m gna be v frank with u. js luckily that sg govt is ruling sg. If they happen to be ruling France with that sort of policies   it will be as violent as this one   mark my words,btohqsg
the French knows what they want,btohqsg
sg sort of policies will be considered unacceptable to them too,btohqsg
the bar that served drinks to a drivers that later on to drive and kill was ordered to pay 301 billion to the family of the killed,btohqsg
Imagine getting 23 billion for sueing a tobacco making company,btohqsg
for killing your spouse who smoked their products,btohqsg
that is honestly bs tho. this rule,btohqsg
it means no matter how bad they do   u have to stay quiet until the protest is approved,btohqsg
it means u allow them to control u,btohqsg
in america you can always sue the source,btohqsg
but likely the 301 billion wont be paid,btohqsg
u allow them to do whatever shit they want,btohqsg
that ‘s what they are doing now,btohqsg
doing some of the shits & yet u can’t rly voice it out,btohqsg
they feel more like u are against them,btohqsg
rather than the idea of feedback,btohqsg
In America  if you get into a accident with a big company...irregardless of who is at fault  you can sue the big company and get a huge payout,btohqsg
having such a law is ok but it is not ok when u have those who feel that u are opposing them instead,btohqsg
i rmb watching that one vid on lky,btohqsg
where he was being interviewed by the bbc,btohqsg
they are paid fat salaries lol,btohqsg
they shld start taking a pay cut alr,btohqsg
that last portion is legit what ive been saying,btohqsg
is extremely overpriced to adopt them in the first place,btohqsg
Like all those ppl complaining...how bout you work hard and stand the chance to become a minister,btohqsg
i just dont know how america can function when these are the kind of bs laws they need to handle,btohqsg
like how much money can they give,btohqsg
this is legit greedy taking over the greedy,btohqsg
but some of the current ones  are they rly that gd,btohqsg
is not as easy as it sounds,btohqsg
u do know that u need to join a certain party to stand a chance,btohqsg
I feel that the system could be improved,btohqsg
it feels v rigged & in need of repair,btohqsg
i also watched that old vid of vivan,btohqsg
this seems to be the scenario,btohqsg
this guy got a intresting history,btohqsg
uk tdy   sg customs was such an ass   Malaysia did a much better job than we do,btohqsg
His father was originally one of the founding members of the PAP...but was barred from entering sg under operation coldstore in 1963 for joining the Barisan socialist,btohqsg
it ‘s surprising to see how ICA have degrade to such inefficiencies,btohqsg
yep  the lifting of being barred from singapore only occured because he became a np in penang,btohqsg
it is but ICA was all the while ok,btohqsg
this instance make me question..what the main motive of operation coldstore was,btohqsg
cause...if it was it claimed it was  this rhetoric here dont fit,btohqsg
The father was from a opposition that pap did not like...so they kick him out of sg etc...but then they lifted the ban when he became a malaysian mp???,btohqsg
so what was the purpose of operation coldstore actually,btohqsg
guys I’m going Parks in June,btohqsg
i shall buy all the luxury goods in the world,btohqsg
oh what’s l1r5 56 up to,btohqsg
what + buying power = demand,btohqsg
it’s bcz of what u said,btohqsg
Yeah want and ability to buy,btohqsg
but also can go to a park,btohqsg
idk but my grandfather was detained because of it without trial for 13 years so,btohqsg
it’s correctness  conciseness   courtesy  concreteness  completeness actually idk if correct@silentvelocity,btohqsg
credit card  condo  car country club career,btohqsg
wah this type of news flies really fast,btohqsg
even if the sgt barely offends us in anyway they gonna check on u like as if u gonna suffer from depression after what they said,btohqsg
he got medic formation patch like us,btohqsg
HE GO ALL THE WAY THERE UNDETECTED,btohqsg
i was literaily a metre away from him,btohqsg
got freaking front row seats for the action packed waving of flag,btohqsg
his name on the nametag was so clear to me,btohqsg
but i forgor his name after like 1h,btohqsg
hi guys how tf do i go to sch.. my toilet is like gone. like gone. i can’t shower for shit and i have to get to sch at 11.,btohqsg
‘why didn’t u come to class’‘my toilet spoil’,btohqsg
then just don't shower go school,btohqsg
u must turn up on time,btohqsg
tdy i need go down studio,btohqsg
ya bro and my toilet not working,btohqsg
at least this did not happen,btohqsg
Wait but how does that happen,btohqsg
Is it cos cold and hot,btohqsg
idk bro some guy use hammer to break,btohqsg
how the Cher go from the first w equation to the second one,btohqsg
Meanwhile we have American Congress being dumb asf and grilling tiktok ceo please that 5 hour video was so embarrassing,btohqsg
Now they implementing the anti trans bills and I'm like bro yall fucking stupid,btohqsg
Like denying trans people health care and forcing trans kids to go through detransitioning,btohqsg
I'm like tf is going on???,btohqsg
so u think a child should be able to transition,btohqsg
a child who needs to be 18 to get a tatoo  18 to vote  but can decide to cut off his dick at 8,btohqsg
OK i dun want to go into tricky territory with this but at least don't discriminate them like that?,btohqsg
even the gay community is against this,btohqsg
u read what this girl say,btohqsg
do yk how many detransitioners are suing the medical practicioners for psychoing them into transitioning,btohqsg
Idk why they want to focus on stuff like that when they have bigger problems to worry about but sure,btohqsg
like from w = -p (v2-v1),btohqsg
to - mR ( T2 - T1),btohqsg
Eh all I see is news on that so I was like this a bad thing or not??,btohqsg
where r u when i need backup,btohqsg
OHHH OK NOW I SEE IT THANKSS UU,btohqsg
its not in my nature to ignore sia,btohqsg
Idk why they suddenly thought I mean that trans kids shld choose whether they wanna transition,btohqsg
dont say so fast i only studying cfa level 1,btohqsg
so u think kids can choose,btohqsg
kids shudnt transition  they dont even know whats gg on,btohqsg
and they have the maturity and insight to choose to transition,btohqsg
i hope u never have kids for their own sake,btohqsg
No I didn't say that I meant that it's kinda dumb that American politicians choose to focus on this matter when there are more concerning things like gun control,btohqsg
but if u go by that line of argument wouldnt any other legislations be irrelevant? wouldnt any other bill enforced on things like gun lgbt and women’s rights be irrelevant since theres bigger issues at hand like the environment,btohqsg
I didn't say kids shld choose,btohqsg
and by that line of argument wouldnt what u consider to be pertinent become senseless to another?,btohqsg
say u consider that the environment is impt for eg,btohqsg
but why shld the environment matter to me if im concerned about pushing poverty out? instead i wld rather dig more oil just so i can support my economy better and disregard the damages to environment entirely,btohqsg
u should be more concern about the recession coming ahead rather then all this lgbt issue lol,btohqsg
and to u lgbt may be impt,btohqsg
Then now TikTok’s American security person step down,btohqsg
to me i care more abt gun control that idh time to care for lgbt,btohqsg
Eh they wanna ban tiktok in USA tho right,btohqsg
since in my perspective lgbt and gender equality has alr made a far way p since the beginning,btohqsg
why ppl care so much abt american gun control and lgbt issue when we live on SG haha,btohqsg
Funny they say that tiktok collecting data when their own companies do it lmfaooo,btohqsg
want to be concern at least concern about job security and housing,btohqsg
now gender equality and womens rights are being subverted by the woke cult,btohqsg
nabei u concern lgbt and gun control on US got what use,btohqsg
sportswoman of the year? a biological man,btohqsg
white house woman of the year?,btohqsg
Everything already hella gray at this point,btohqsg
why the fuck u changing the subject literally nobodys talking abt tiktok,btohqsg
Tbh   at least they don’t blatantly flaunt ships with massive ass satellites,btohqsg
anyone using the latest windows updates  my font fuckign weird,btohqsg
anna why we jumping around topics rn,btohqsg
i mean the tiktok attack is obviously political but who the fuck brought that up,btohqsg
the train of thought going brrrrr,btohqsg
the point of this is that anna here is in favour of mutilitating kids,btohqsg
letting a kid transition when he doesnt know better,btohqsg
tbvh everytime i hear i read until,btohqsg
i cant decide where u wld place urself ss,btohqsg
wan le wan le wan le,btohqsg
lgbt stuff should be kept out of schools tbh,btohqsg
bc i dont think he has the mental capacity to be aware of politics,btohqsg
im so lazy to tag him,btohqsg
but then again the low iq statistically lean left,btohqsg
Yea they change the font to some weird shit,btohqsg
i hope she knows who hitler is,btohqsg
cuz giving kids the wrong impression,btohqsg
ah see this one woke fuck,btohqsg
u wld rsther teach a kid actual stuff than expand them too early,btohqsg
so thats ur response to a fact,btohqsg
cue that one scene in modern family where lily says shes gay,btohqsg
that shows a lot about ur mental capabilities,btohqsg
Sorry to ask but wdym by actual stuff like education?,btohqsg
Go ahead change to racism lol,btohqsg
I mean what is the purpose of this Chinese ship,btohqsg
im confused but im interested in the commotion rn,btohqsg
essentially this girl anna thinks that children should be allowed to transition,btohqsg
Unlike the US that at least don’t do it that blatantly,btohqsg
u gna allow a kid who cant get a tatoo to chop off his dick,btohqsg
i mean im p sure im the youngest in this convo rn,btohqsg
ah ya motte and bailey fallacy,btohqsg
how old r u sia haha,btohqsg
u’ll know if u learn history,btohqsg
how old r u  why so woke one,btohqsg
And i think transitioning is rlly a big thing,btohqsg
conflating the extreme propositions with equally confusing and less controversial ones and placing them under the same basket of ideas,btohqsg
The interesting part is china has two of these ships in Sea,btohqsg
And they have been anchored offshore from countries,btohqsg
am i saying it wrong? idk,btohqsg
So what's the problem with the ships then??,btohqsg
bc the motte she retreated to isnt exactly about the same thing so idk if its still a valid motte bailey fallacy callout,btohqsg
And nt rlly exposed to much of the outside world considering we r still restricted to lots of stuff i mean..not knowing what age range is being meant by anna?,btohqsg
brother is 16 and has more common sense than half the woke fucks,btohqsg
Wth is a motte and bailey fallacy i think iw to read up but i have physics tmr,btohqsg
but then again statistically people who lean left have much lower iq……,btohqsg
Its js my opinion but unneccessary dispute there,btohqsg
sorry but twitter rlly has good porn lol,btohqsg
and also cos i saw twit porn i got horrified and deleted that shit,btohqsg
And we saw this near Singapore,btohqsg
what porn sia my twitter is all,btohqsg
It shows that China is not shy when it comes to power,btohqsg
i saw one post on porn and i deleted,btohqsg
Its js all the elon musk thing that im nt interested in,btohqsg
i prefer reddit. Is there even a link with twitter?,btohqsg
Sometimes they ask u to sign in or sm shit liddat,btohqsg
china and usa has always been like this,btohqsg
they act like they dont spy on their own people,btohqsg
they act like they dont spy on european governments,btohqsg
Arent china and usa always like fighting for power 😭 its like never ending,btohqsg
they asked that guy shit questions anyway,btohqsg
Yea I'm not sure what's the main reason,btohqsg
both of those countries have nuclear weapons,btohqsg
Where the button come press press,btohqsg
The Internet connection WiFi question was hilarious,btohqsg
oh yeah russia is at war also right,btohqsg
I know one thing and that is for sure  America will never win china via the land  air or sea,btohqsg
Y tf they need nuclear weapons,btohqsg
How much is their military power??,btohqsg
they mainly saying they want to ban tiktok because their spying on americans,btohqsg
As if their own companies don't do that,btohqsg
Cos this one start since ww2,btohqsg
Cos America made atom bomb for ww2,btohqsg
like ww1 and ww2 not deadly enough they need to start a nuclear war,btohqsg
honestly most of the american ppl using tiktok probably dont even care abt the us and china thing,btohqsg
And then Russia also made them then it spanned out to a whole ass cold War shit,btohqsg
walao wtf iw to survive hello.,btohqsg
they care more about how many genders there are,btohqsg
They have outdated machinery  have you wondered why America could send so many military supplies to Ukraine?,btohqsg
They prolly only know abt the charli damelio and all the celebs teas,btohqsg
I thought the main reason for that was cos the NATO thing,btohqsg
i see those shit i seriously want to vomit blood,btohqsg
Because those military supplies are nearly 30 years old…whatever they have sent are all surplus,btohqsg
Cos isn't Ukraine supposed to be like neutral,btohqsg
soviet union wanted to catch up with us,btohqsg
That is how much they had spent on their military across the last few decades,btohqsg
russia wants ukraine to be neutral,btohqsg
but the west wants ukraine in nato,btohqsg
It's also because Ukraine right in between Russia and nati,btohqsg
To the point they can send 30 yr old machinery that still works,btohqsg
Honestly blame the cold War for this shit,btohqsg
Wtf was the main cause of everything even,btohqsg
send the first satellite into space too,btohqsg
Or whoever leaked info to the Russians on the atom bomb,btohqsg
you know how austria became an independent country on 1955,btohqsg
while germany was split into west and east,btohqsg
Japan would not surrender cos they were stubborn asses,btohqsg
so the whole point is every country thinks they're better than the other,btohqsg
Then the idiots who made that released jnfo to Russia I think,btohqsg
The Franz ferdinando assassination  tho started everything,btohqsg
was at war with the middle east for 20 years,btohqsg
Yes and since then the treaty of versatile also started ww2 indirectly,btohqsg
Something interesting to note was that hiroshima was not the intended bomb target,btohqsg
Then we have George w Bush lying about the wmds,btohqsg
It originally was planned on kokura,btohqsg
Oh then which target was it??,btohqsg
hitler wanted to avenge the treaty of versailles,btohqsg
He also hated the Jews and blamed them,btohqsg
that guys a fucking war criminal,btohqsg
Yea yall saw that vid where a veteran yelled at him,btohqsg
wtf this is too much to take in,btohqsg
said that they betrayed the germans,btohqsg
Tbh if u see the documentaries someone else jnfluenced him liddat,btohqsg
I think it was sme dude named eckart,btohqsg
and the jews were the reasons germany lost or something,btohqsg
i heard it was his time in vienna,btohqsg
Bro could have painted a rosy history,btohqsg
the art school said that his artworks are architecture paintings,btohqsg
But decided to paint with with blood instead,btohqsg
the french and germans are mad at their leaders,btohqsg
Out of context but who here is sick rn,btohqsg
they want their government to stop funding the war in ukraine,btohqsg
the part where i said about the anti trans bills was not meant to be fucking woke  i meant that they used that as a means to divert attention from other concerning things,btohqsg
the gun control logic they have is damn warped,btohqsg
Guys y’all know what are the two countries America will never want to loose association with?,btohqsg
idk why people here said i used the fallacy thing,btohqsg
Turkey and Iran….One very simple reason,btohqsg
Bro iw to be as knowledgeable as futureofryan when im 18,btohqsg
then my french relatives say they want france to leave nato,btohqsg
Most weapons that eventually make it into the US transit only through these two countries,btohqsg
yea its alw turkey and iran,btohqsg
i more concerned my relatives living in texas,btohqsg
It’s like their lifelines for guns…so loosing it is like cutting a blood line,btohqsg
yall ever noticed their gun logic in america is so fucking weird??,btohqsg
most of my relatives live in western nations,btohqsg
Wait until you see their weapon logic,btohqsg
like if you want to stop gun violence  reduce guns but they are like no,btohqsg
my family is the only one still in asia,btohqsg
they increase the number of guns and even think of arming teachers???,btohqsg
You can install a machine gun on a car in America and it’s legal,btohqsg
they like to commit school shootings,btohqsg
But you can’t carry it in public,btohqsg
you can buy a gun at walmart its that easy,btohqsg
thats literally the basic human right,btohqsg
they only start school shootings because theyre mentally ill,btohqsg
bruh they can change their constitution but they cannot change this,btohqsg
lmao right healthcare in america is fucking crazy,btohqsg
tbh the anti trans shit started happening cos a trans shooter carried out an attack,btohqsg
dude its like they only care about money,btohqsg
It honestly goes more in dept  the reason is because the cops in the us are not obligated under the constitution to protect people,btohqsg
say goodbye to your life if you turn up to a hospital and say you need cancer treatment,btohqsg
go to a public hospital? its shit,btohqsg
They are there to uphold order,btohqsg
oh thats why cops can brutalize anyone there,btohqsg
cost: ur whole lifetime suppy of money,btohqsg
there have been people who went bankrupt due to this shitty system,btohqsg
that country has so much issues yet they care so much about democratizing other nations,btohqsg
That is why  a cop gets to keep his job or get rehired if they do abuse people but the outcome results in order of the situation,btohqsg
hilarious how they are willfully blind ask,btohqsg
i saw a girl on twitter who was selling her body on onlyfans to pay her cancer bills,btohqsg
tbh  no one gives a shit about black people killing black people in the ghettos over there  but when its a white person or a black person that kills the opposite shit goes down,btohqsg
so glad i dont live there i wonder how some of my cousins live there,btohqsg
thats why i felt the blm movement felt so weak,btohqsg
bro idek whats going on in that country anymore,btohqsg
The blm movement honestly to me was just a over reaction,btohqsg
no my qn is why tf are guns so easily accessible??,btohqsg
i spelled it wrong i think,btohqsg
people die everyday  yall gon make a protest everyday then?,btohqsg
A lot of guns that are part of shootings are called “ghost guns”,btohqsg
and no one thought it wasn't like  detrimental? Even their forefathers didn't feel comfortable with this amendment and said to edit it every 19 years. been damn long already,btohqsg
idfk whats going on in their heads llol,btohqsg
mainly i think its the republicans who fuel this,btohqsg
I mean America is one of a few countries in the world where they can shut down their government if they wanted to and end up still alive,btohqsg
cos they sponsered by nra mah,btohqsg
my parents call america a mental hospital and the 300m people who live there are all mentally ill,btohqsg
Shutting down their government meant that government employees were not paid,btohqsg
But still had to do their jobs,btohqsg
have you seen the size of their portions? and the tipping system is so alien why not give better wages,btohqsg
they start the weirdest tiktok trends and do such cringe and stupid shit,btohqsg
they invented pronouns and gender identities that ive never even thought of,btohqsg
The idiocy comes when the politicians still get paid during the government shutdown,btohqsg
funny how its considered a first world country when their structures of healthcare and education are worse than third world countries,btohqsg
pov u have 2 69 iq idiots debating about world issues,btohqsg
they can only say that theyre better than third world countries,btohqsg
but cant compare themselves to european countries,btohqsg
anyone heard of the BRICS thing?? Idk what the fuck is that,btohqsg
something about challenging the american dollar,btohqsg
The recent protests and riots is evident,btohqsg
They want to devalue the America dollar,btohqsg
thought that was in france lmfao,btohqsg
i swear if this causes another great depression again-,btohqsg
France got the worst but Germany and Italy also protested,btohqsg
They called it the May Day protest,btohqsg
they went to blackrock investment company,btohqsg
burned down the bordeaux city town hall,btohqsg
ok i do know macron is unpopular but to this extent?,btohqsg
they hate what their government is doing,btohqsg
bro have you heard of marine le pen,btohqsg
France has been unhappy with the government for a lot of years alr,btohqsg
Every few years you will see them rioting,btohqsg
and ever since the protest she has been becoming more and more popular,btohqsg
ok can someone explain to me the difference of right and left in politics,btohqsg
marine le pen wants france to live the eu though,btohqsg
whats so bad about being in the extremes for these,btohqsg
i heard left wing favors equality,btohqsg
BREXIT but make it french  FREXIT,btohqsg
like communism is all about making everybody the same,btohqsg
You said it…they push their ideologies to the extreme,btohqsg
Anything that is pushed to the extreme is never good,btohqsg
they said they want to behead macron the same way they beheaded louis xvi,btohqsg
is it the guy who wave the flag in ns ah,btohqsg
THEY PUT HIS HEAD ONTO LOUIS XVI'S PORTRAIT LOL,btohqsg
but compared to a weak king who was placed there as a child  macron is a grown ass man who KNOWS what hes doing??,btohqsg
he didn't find but someone else did  now in custody of 2 and 3 crab,btohqsg
2 or 3 crab? what that mean,btohqsg
cuz this ops not special enough,btohqsg
and he ran for office and was elected too its not like he was forced to be in office,btohqsg
3 star is highest rank in SAF,btohqsg
that people in this country also like politics,btohqsg
so that guy wave the flag or smth>,btohqsg
help how did he just rush up there and do that,btohqsg
stood on the thingy where u stand behind and speak,btohqsg
i always felt so alone in school because people would say reading the news is useless,btohqsg
unless u take GP yes it is,btohqsg
wait then what happen after that guy wave flag,btohqsg
I literally have no clue how the France riots are going to turn into,btohqsg
for you is 9 TO 5  ASA!,btohqsg
Like what is going to happen,btohqsg
run all ard nee soon camp,btohqsg
eh might as well just go with the flow,btohqsg
the guy? he ran away isit,btohqsg
Yea basically  did that to the blm protest as well,btohqsg
must have been excellent at hide and seek,btohqsg
sorry man didn't have special forces to help 😭,btohqsg
Just went with the flow to see city after city destroyed,btohqsg
HE WENT TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF CAMP LMFAO,btohqsg
NO ONE DID SHIT WHILE HE DID THAT AND RAN AWAY?,btohqsg
we seek save serve not find lost people,btohqsg
they say that when they peacefully protes thte government doesnt listen to them,btohqsg
so they have to resort to violence,btohqsg
they tried chasing him down but they too slow for him,btohqsg
