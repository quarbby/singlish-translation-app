Sta sure b one. Also  if dealer desperate  you should be worrying. And they sure tell you no point ppi. I highly recommend you walk away no matter how interested you are.,btohqsg
Correct. And big names doesn't mean trustworthy dealer. Even friend recommended dealer also can sabo you one.,btohqsg
It's never too late  take it as an insurance against future serious repairs,btohqsg
Call up and ask. And I recommend insist on ppi else walk away. If you put deposit liao  take it that you're doing charity.,btohqsg
Sign agreement also can walk away  dealer can't sue you,btohqsg
If dealer dun allow  and quote all his rubbish rules  then your alarm bells should ring even louder,btohqsg
Morning car enthusiasts   sgcatmart got this features - buysafe and Sgcarmart warranty. Is it worth buying used car with either 1 of these labels or just a marketing gimmick?,btohqsg
I think buysafe better. Likely a bit more ex than those without,btohqsg
If the car keep it for more 1.5 yr and it is a new car. Should I be worry?,btohqsg
What I mean if the dealer keep for 1.5yr n it is a new ca  should I buy it?,btohqsg
Keep for 1.5 year is okay. But they got maintain it during the 1.5 year anot,btohqsg
Just cus a car never drive doesnt mean dont need do maintenance leh,btohqsg

Should be management car or test car. Usually these are OK as long as the warranties are there and they do a complete check and service for the car before delivery,btohqsg
Mileage is around 70km. Looks like show car,btohqsg
Should be a showroom car  if really keen on this car  can ask for discounts and freebies to go with it. Like extended Road Tax  Insurance rebate  etc. They will want to sell it before it becomes a really 2nd hand car.,btohqsg
If the deal is good I will seriously consider. My current car has less than 60days to drive before going to the scrap yard or exported... COE too high for extension...,btohqsg
Shag then what car u gna replace it with?,btohqsg
Some cars really not worth renewing,btohqsg
I would wonder why he keep for 1.5yr,btohqsg
Must ensure after transfer the count must not be 2,btohqsg

You really want a golf over the i30 don't you,btohqsg

Actually i30 got a lot of mods also,btohqsg
But i lowkey dw the basic golf cus no electric seat or keyless start stop,btohqsg
Yes but prolly need to wait for them bring stock in,btohqsg
Golf has more options in terms of budget ranges for specific mods,btohqsg
But because of that a lot of them have cheap mods on and are poorly maintained too,btohqsg
Are you getting golf after the 116d?,btohqsg
If car cant sell i stick w it for now,btohqsg
I saw one cheap one. Stock. But mileage high and based on my expectations,btohqsg
