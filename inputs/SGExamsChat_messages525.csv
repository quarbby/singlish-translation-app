Well in MOEs eyes u have the power to make your own decision,btohqsg
When all the chips are down at the end of the day if u made a decision your parents literally have no power to change it,btohqsg
Yall not that mature to have credit card yet.,btohqsg
If so the bank delinquency rates are gonna be double digit lol,btohqsg
It's the start of your adulting phase at 16,btohqsg
No one knows everything from the start,btohqsg
Gotta be honest with you.. most of us are just winging it  till today I have no idea what the fuck I am doing,btohqsg
Oh this episode of my laptop is self destructin,btohqsg
Same bro  I scored a 7/24 for quiz and came back with a B grade,btohqsg
Yes.. u can't expect 16 year old for that matter to know much of the world lol,btohqsg
i got level 4 and 3 for g107,btohqsg
My sdl and Col both level 4,btohqsg
You got other assignments as well right?,btohqsg
A lot of ppl got A,btohqsg
What you mean? Teamwork worksheet and 2 hbl lessons,btohqsg
Either ways that also means grading for that mod is lax lor,btohqsg
Yea but I don’t think that plays much of a part if 3/4 of the class got A,btohqsg
My first grade for it was D  3/4 got B and C’s,btohqsg
Yea but my aks was lvl 2,btohqsg
Yeah if it's 7/24 and it's the only thing u would have gotten a 1,btohqsg
Auto C no matter how your faci upgrade anything,btohqsg
I think faci gave us a nice break,btohqsg
Same faci I got a D,btohqsg
Probably the faci got told by the module chair to be more lax,btohqsg
my math lecturer hates my team,btohqsg
But I think if u say almost all As then the next cluster it's gonna be back to a C or D,btohqsg
Yea likely because 3/4 of DISM and D3D students failed the mod’s ese last batch,btohqsg
u have alr left poly isit,btohqsg
In RP u cannot get a F unless u never submit anything,btohqsg
Yeah that's seems sus lol u can flag that up with the module chair,btohqsg
Then bring it up to your program chair,btohqsg
If still don't care then deputy director,btohqsg
Yea  that one time my faci gave a F....everybody had their grades changed to either improve by 1 or remained above F except 1 student,btohqsg
that 1 student went on to fail 4 modules in sem2,btohqsg
Limpeh only attend 7/13 lessons for all my module in Y2S2,btohqsg
I kena B+ to D for all my mods,btohqsg
ill be honest  you would have better off been to other poly's if possible. At least getting kicked there  you can start anew in rp,btohqsg
I’m gonna be honest with you if u don’t put ur foot down u will never get what u want,btohqsg
My G107 I did it on full HBL,btohqsg
Just take charge of your own life don’t give a frick what ur parents say,btohqsg
because your just gonna end up in the same cycle and complain,btohqsg
No u just do a hostile takeover,btohqsg
U make your own choices and live with it if u dropout then choose whatever u want,btohqsg
And I am asking what u plan to do cuz if u wanna do it like actually be independent of your parents,btohqsg
U better have a sound.. ish plan,btohqsg
Yep same I’m not like attacking you or smth,btohqsg
And take what so are u gonna take History?,btohqsg
cos it’s difficult if u want to go back poly or wtv,btohqsg
And u wanna aim for History in Uni or Business,btohqsg
business but you said i don't need to take econs,btohqsg
U don't but I don't understand why u would wanna take History if u never taken it before.,btohqsg
And since u wanna go to business econs is a better subject,btohqsg
Dropping out of poly..is not like dropping out in sec school,btohqsg
least you drop out in sec school  the govt will still guide you with a way back to the education system but poly its very diff,btohqsg
Ok great then what's your other 2 H2,btohqsg
yes i want to die because ive no hope in lifeI'm being told by my parents that im incapable of doing anything on my own. awesome! :D,btohqsg
Have you taken them at Os before?,btohqsg
i love learning about dna and anatomy,btohqsg
Hmm yeah some JCs will not allow that,btohqsg
U can just choose a arts stream instead lol,btohqsg
I seriously think that’s not something you should joke with,btohqsg
a math helps but i have heard of people doing well for h2 math without a math,btohqsg
ive been suicidal for a long while already,btohqsg
idc about what other people think tbh,btohqsg
and in jc if other people don't want to study,btohqsg
yep   i mean they had nice tutors in JC that took time off to teach them A math during consults + some JCs do recap of a math before starting h2 math,btohqsg
so I'm gonna study myself after school and im not planning to make friendsno influence is the best,btohqsg
I have lost 3 friends to suicide and almost jumped before and it’s abit inconsiderate to like joke about it,btohqsg
Like if u are actively suicidal it legit something that most professionals would have to report immediately so pls don't joke for that,btohqsg
ah great  i just hope that the teachers there are good :),btohqsg
I tried once but fail yeah waking up in a hospital bed in the er is not a good thing,btohqsg
Especially since people actually suffer from that and you say that you do suffer from it,btohqsg
I hope you are doing well mentally,btohqsg
I study to take my brain off of it,btohqsg
its honestly a tough life lesson and will change a person,btohqsg
Same I stay occupied with something constantly to forget about it,btohqsg
it has fucked me up and benefited me to ig,btohqsg
idc if people bully me or insult me anymore,btohqsg
in the sense that I cherish people more and take more time to talk to them,btohqsg
or if my parents belittles me,btohqsg
There is no two ways about viewing something like that...Either you unleash your inner demons and reveal your true narcicistic self or reveal your true angelic and sorrowful self,btohqsg
anyway back to math until I’m bored,btohqsg
depends on the day lmao it’s one of the other,btohqsg
We are all just coping and wrapping our heads around this fuck up world,btohqsg
yea  but there will never be a inbetween,btohqsg
If it works then who fucking cares if it's detrimental,btohqsg
indeed the more i read politics the more i love being a misanthropist,btohqsg
talking bout fucked up...a russian town got attacked  so we are tentatively closer by one day,btohqsg
they want to start another one,btohqsg
this generation has not been more apparent to live the YOLO life as any other generation that has come before,btohqsg
And this is why I don't think history is for you.,btohqsg
oh nah...when tf did europe start both world wars,btohqsg
See the world as a complex adaptive system.. there is no single cause and effect,btohqsg
germany didnt declare war on poland?austria hungary didnt declare war on serbia?,btohqsg
Yeah but why did Germany fall to hitler,btohqsg
no wonder my parents are correct,btohqsg
I'm dumb and don't know anything,btohqsg
It's just u don't know much about something u never studied before,btohqsg
history always got like two sides ig,btohqsg
Which is why I am telling you not to make the same mistakes,btohqsg
I too pure hist for os,btohqsg
I loved it but never again,btohqsg
Choose something u actually done and excel at and are happy to do,btohqsg
"This is not how you should view war...Its not ""Who fired the first shot"" but rather ""Why the first shot was fired""",btohqsg
I never loved history tbh but when I wrote I scored,btohqsg
eg of common question bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki justified or not,btohqsg
i smoked this when i was asked this during humanities,btohqsg
hiroshima/nagasaki is prob one of the easiest qns they could have asked,btohqsg
yea sia  i keep understanding all the stupid shit wrong,btohqsg
I am supposed to be doing math,btohqsg
"i see churchill get dragged...im like  who tf is that ""dragging him""",btohqsg
but I have a headache after staring at it for one second,btohqsg
"To put into context what a H2 Question is in scope ""Explain the cause and consequences of the Asian Financial Crisis.""",btohqsg
"like ive never seen that dude in my life  then after exam...ppl be saying  that is stalin. Im like ""that dude dont look nothing like stalin""",btohqsg
TLDR: Fishy transactions in the stock market by US ppl,btohqsg
not my area of expertise HAHHAHAHAH,btohqsg
likely a fallback  weakened by the US one,btohqsg
ehh I go annoy my pets,btohqsg
if the US did not have their own  likely asia's one would not have been as bad,btohqsg
The TLDR is the Trade imbalance and rise of the Asian tigers lead to massive current account deficits and surplus which the system of fixed exchange rates could not support,btohqsg
Then u also have to explain the shit fest of timing,btohqsg
In As especially for H2 History it's Economic History which is totally different monster,btohqsg
i still cant believe how fucked japan was dealt with from this,btohqsg
They still haven't recovered till today lol,btohqsg
I do not understand what u meant by that,btohqsg
The more I grow up  the more I realised I gave too much care for situations I need not care,btohqsg
japan did not really get involved did they?,btohqsg
I have this piece of shit classmate,btohqsg
the problem with this is when  ppl actually should care. they dont and this is why now you got a US president that cant talk properly and falls every now and then,btohqsg
I found it funny to read such stuff,btohqsg
My sense of humor is that fucked up,btohqsg
''if u think people care about u enough to even hate you  u are thinking too highly of urself'',btohqsg
what actually impacted japan so greatly is the real qns,btohqsg
Why do u care about ppl hating me when I am already engrossed with how much I hate myself,btohqsg
U talking about what the war or the boom and crash?,btohqsg
Japan wasn't rlly affect a lot by the AFC.,btohqsg
The AFC refers to Thailand Indonesia and South Korea Mainly,btohqsg
but they got fucked during the timeline for some reason,btohqsg
Care for things which is necessary  that's appropriate,btohqsg
They got fuck separately from the AFC,btohqsg
They would have been fucked either ways,btohqsg
bruh im so lost with the elections,btohqsg
The US Presidential Elections or SG Presidential Election?,btohqsg
Care but don't get obsessed wit it  uknowhatimsayin¿,btohqsg
i could give two shits bout the US...clowns they are,btohqsg
Why? The candidates have been announced already?,btohqsg
Hahahaha u must be new it doesn't matter in the SG context either ways,btohqsg
that is the problem lol  i cant do any background research and then by the time they get announced ill have no time to ever check up the candidate's reputation,btohqsg
oh yea  i forgot what the president in sg does. The one that i should be concern with should be the prime minister elections,btohqsg
We all know who's gonna win anyways it will be the case for the next 2-3 cycles anyways,btohqsg
i hope..if not im lost as shit,btohqsg
''u think???? u think SOME MORE'',btohqsg
yea i think basically the ones that elect the prime minister,btohqsg
Okayat least there's no puppets this time,btohqsg
''u know what is the problem? u and UR THINKING!'',btohqsg
At least I get my public holiday this time,btohqsg
"""AH  MAKE ME WAIT SOMEMORE  CAN  WHOLE LOT DROP  I SAID WHOLE LOT FUCKING DROPPPPP!!!!!!!!""",btohqsg
"""Candidates  Don't be fucking weak  when I say push up  we mean Diamond""",btohqsg
''down down down NVM START FROM 0 down down down'',btohqsg
''yall pass ippt but cannot even do 5 push ups'',btohqsg
"""Candidate! You wanna cry some more? Fuck off lah  get off this Selection""",btohqsg
He probably already excuse physical activity by then liao,btohqsg
Wonder what excuse he used this time,btohqsg
Nothing beats the Special Forces Selection  like fr,btohqsg
Like actually witnessing it in person  holy fuck,btohqsg
There's only so many times one can have a headache,btohqsg
O.o bold of you to assume,btohqsg
U say more I gonna make a police report arh,btohqsg
Did u just assume my gender?,btohqsg
Yea hence why normally graduation usually don’t serve much food,btohqsg
Unless it’s a buffet  the food served usually is just playable or half-filling,btohqsg
no lah   got other people go also  just that all u see on social media are from those people lorh,btohqsg
can dont go mah   quite common for people to just go out with their friends instead,btohqsg
and sometimes the ticket overpriced smh,btohqsg
that one ask ur own school but very likely free bah,btohqsg
Its a nightmare if you no friends bah,btohqsg
my entire class only a small number went,btohqsg
I wouldnt have gone then eitherway,btohqsg
u grad how long alr ah,btohqsg
their highlight is to go to the club after,btohqsg
"study so much  why not have ""fun""",btohqsg
forget about the christian values they sing in church fr,btohqsg
"ginna comes from the chinese dialect ""hokkien"".derived from ""gin-a"".It means child in Hokkien",btohqsg
i heard such story during bmt also LOL,btohqsg
"""the toilet always smells damn nice""""why?""""people vape inside""",btohqsg
but siao ginna dont mean crazy child,btohqsg
well looks like if i cant go jc ill just go to a better poly next year,btohqsg
hope that the lecturers actually care this time round,btohqsg
if not i give up completely,btohqsg
? ur msgs dont show that,btohqsg
Watching them do stores early in the morning before the conduct hahah,btohqsg
Just observe and be happy for everyone :),btohqsg
Officially haven't yet you are in your study period,btohqsg

Eh this one I tot still in poly?,btohqsg
And then he wonder why his GPA is in el hamam,btohqsg
I mean it's cuz he pay full membership fees la but still work and poly especially for stem courses not ideal,btohqsg
So the lesson we learnt is to choose the right passport,btohqsg
My payment is by gun on the desk,btohqsg
Gong jiao wei haven't even seen your Sem 1 scores yet,btohqsg
I vaguely remember a discussion on jokes … Nigel Ng? here’s something relevant:https://tdy.sg/3P1cPtV,btohqsg
oh no..if i said mine  ill be in the news as well,btohqsg
Also depends on the platform and the audience that you tell the jokes to,btohqsg
I’m low key surprised that ministers weighed in,btohqsg
You know what after the double down I don't rlly think that's that bad,btohqsg
One is in Tampines the other in Pioneer,btohqsg
I prefer to stick with fries then I dip it myself,btohqsg
However I do wonder tho with this glitch does it mean I can get hashbrowns after breakfast,btohqsg
A 16 year old Bedok being a little shit,btohqsg

You ever heard of the tale of darth plagueis the wise?,btohqsg
I thought not. It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith  so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.,btohqsg
Hang on my dude..Darth Plagueis gain such strength not by hard work or determination but by YOLOing all tests. So YOLO go in without a calculator for a maths exams or without a computer for an online assessment,btohqsg
I think it's like clockwork for him sia every 3 hours,btohqsg
Anyone like the double quarter pounder at micky d,btohqsg
When I am feeling very hungry yes... usually that or the dbl mcspicy,btohqsg
Big mac is a scam right,btohqsg
Bc no one wants that 3rd bun,btohqsg
Just get a dbl cheese burger imo,btohqsg
Unless u rlly die die wan that big mac sauce,btohqsg
The orange thing is the special sauce lol,btohqsg
Like 70 cents to a buck,btohqsg
Who's to say he did it on accident,btohqsg
Funny thing is I'm in msia rn,btohqsg

Downloaded the pic  how tf he got into that position,btohqsg
And on right on his asshole,btohqsg
My mother's face massager that is the definition,btohqsg
He says as he tells the paramedics I swear it was a accident,btohqsg
SM Tharman to run for President  will resign from Govt and PAP on July 7https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/sm-tharman-to-run-for-president-will-resign-from-govt-and-pap-on-july-7,btohqsg
U say that la but there's a reason we never had a elected minority head of state before,btohqsg
The main PAP voter base is.. 40-80 and Chinese.. what the fuck u think is gonna happen,btohqsg
The prices in genting rlly are adjusted to sg,btohqsg

they say they will teach u this next day say u are expected to know this 💀,btohqsg
yes A lvls is like that,btohqsg
Na bro that's just a weird thing maths and sci do,btohqsg
The thing tho is that they technically have powers which can really be pivotal if say... an opposition party got control of it,btohqsg
sorry this prob like a dumb qn,btohqsg
f = ma or f = mg rite,btohqsg
free fall acceleration or when gravitational force provides for centripetal force,btohqsg
Basically f=ma is the general formula f=mg is specifically for gravity,btohqsg
Or smth like that.. haven't touch physics since like Sec 3,btohqsg
Also the popular in marine parade closing down 😢,btohqsg
Which one Ong Teng Cheong or Devan Nair?,btohqsg

I wonder if he went to the 7am unveiling of the new train at Tuas Link Recently,btohqsg
I would be surprised if he didnt,btohqsg
Yeah he only relented or chose not to pursue the matter cuz he was a part of the PAP leadership,btohqsg
Yeah but honestly in all party's there's factions one,btohqsg
So that doesn't surprise me in the slightest,btohqsg
This doesn't sound like you.. cmon tell us the details,btohqsg
U referring to what? The actual tree or the air freshener,btohqsg

I finna scolded when back to sch bc I called someone who molested a girl sex offender,btohqsg
bro is going to go fishing for his school lunch,btohqsg
if only got bedok FS i wld have put,btohqsg
Apparently the sch have problem with people calling people what they are,btohqsg
or maybe there is but i nvr see properly,btohqsg
Plus he molested 2 girls from what I hear,btohqsg
Oh yea and my sch also has a sec 2 who took upskirt photos kr smt,btohqsg
Bro u sure your school ain't a prison isit,btohqsg

I live 5 mins away from that school,btohqsg
My sec school is the other bedok nearby,btohqsg
Ya la all neighbourhood schools what the fuck u think,btohqsg
At least we ain't Ping Yi or Bedok Green,btohqsg
Hey at least bv got money to spend,btohqsg

Freaking bds is a rundown dumpster,btohqsg
Limpeh school is called budget south,btohqsg

"my school was called ""fake elite""",btohqsg
my father visited bedok to decide if manjusri should be my sec school...he said they got a school campus three times the size of a average football field,btohqsg
My sch put on its insta like alumni valedictorian of tamp meridian jc,btohqsg

This kid once did like 2 5hr energy plus monster,btohqsg
my friends brought vodka to school,btohqsg
another one payed out for half the drinks stall.and treated everybody in the canteen lmao,btohqsg
My friends brought a 18+  card game to sch and played it,btohqsg
Basically the more innapropriate and messed up  the better,btohqsg
I also got math hod for e and a math t h,btohqsg
Then u wan donald trump instead?,btohqsg
What is is pissing me off is the fact that you are trying justify your messed up moral compass. You are old enough but have the emotional maturity of a kid to hate someone on superficial characteristics. It is no wonder you wrote a mein kampf summary. Whats worse than a racist is some one who pretends not to be one. You see a life as less worth because he/she is poor. You find the concept of an indian person running for president a wtf moment. I can only imagine what you type behind the veil of anonymity and what other perverted things you do. Whats worse is not the fact that you are racist but its the fact that no one is here is mature enough at 20yo to be the bigger man and stand up for the weak and helpless seemingly oblivious to the elephant in the room.,btohqsg
I am simply stating the reality of the modern world. You know why I said that? Is because the voter base is on the basis of racial discrimination the realities of this world is cruel harsh and painful u prance around thinking you are bigger on in calling this out. Here's the truth even if personally u aren't racist as a Chinese we benefit from the homogeneity of our society,btohqsg
You want to live in a fantasy world where all humans value is equal sure but I can tell you in our current economic system that simply isn't the case. You wanna know why Mein Kampf is not banned in Singapore? Its because a discernable reader would be able to sieve out the realities in hindsight. But the policies on the book where very much made true in the 1930s-1940s with horrible consequences so stand up do that do so but do take note as a one man army you will get as far as hitler did in the bunker in 1945,btohqsg
Even got buggy to fetch your from ie end to the other,btohqsg
What did i miss when I turnt of my data roaming,btohqsg
I mean didn't the economy boom in just time,btohqsg
Oh yea and he built the wall,btohqsg
But a step to prevent aliens,btohqsg
Na all he did was make it harder for aliens to legally seek asylum in the US,btohqsg
There's like a 20 year wait rn for asylum seekers so that's actually why u see ppl crossing the border,btohqsg
I'm gonna stop here before I get cancelled,btohqsg
But oil prices plummet is good,btohqsg
Na bro continue if you don't that's gonna just Compound the thoughts you have personally,btohqsg
All in all republican democrat pretty much the same lmao,btohqsg
Yes. That's the point I was getting at they both are shit,btohqsg
You are just choosing the best of the worse,btohqsg
Also I want you to think about this.. so when oil prices plummet a lot of producers will go bankrupt right? Decrease the supply of oil in the long run. What do u think will happen after?,btohqsg
My throat is still dry from that pine tip,btohqsg
Why did u even eat it?,btohqsg
Ppl say it has a unique flavour,btohqsg
And made like honey infused with it,btohqsg
Well olives have a unique flavour but u don't see ppl eating that raw,btohqsg
But pine is exotic to sg,btohqsg
Btw do not eat a raw olive in case it isn't clear,btohqsg
The young pine cone is flabourless,btohqsg
I am still trying to chase away that uwu Asian koel from my window,btohqsg
Or if reachable grab it and cook it,btohqsg
And pigeon is a small bird,btohqsg
The thing is that pigeons have a very massive breast,btohqsg
As long as it moves and isn't poisonous can eat,btohqsg
Yeah but not much meat bro the effort to reward ratio is too low,btohqsg
There the last sentence thats your true nature,btohqsg
And what is your true nature? The self proclaimed hero and protector?,btohqsg
I bet you would love a selfie with hitler,btohqsg
That would probably sell for a lot,btohqsg
What's the purpose of their breast then?,btohqsg
To fly so they can flap their wings?,btohqsg
I would love to have a photoshoot eith him,btohqsg
I will sell that opportunity gotta commercialise on it,btohqsg
Oh  the baby birds don't get milk from their mother?,btohqsg
Not a pathetic hitler adoring cunt like you,btohqsg
Bro idk about pigeons anatomy lol,btohqsg
Let me guess you are a discord mod too,btohqsg
Hahaha he just used a LGBTQ slur on me,btohqsg
You have no data to back your strawman fallacies,btohqsg
Ayo  we're having a civil war here now?,btohqsg
Can you see whos morally fked up,btohqsg
Na bro he's digging himself a bigger hole,btohqsg
Gotta admit I love the ss uniforms,btohqsg
The one in the basement meatriding hitler,btohqsg
Ask him to shower also pls,btohqsg
Should I try to sustain this for later enjoyment?,btohqsg
"""My grandfather was an electrician """,btohqsg
He was very good at it apparently he had so many metals,btohqsg
But why tf did the Italians treat the Greeks nice,btohqsg
I heard somewhere like the Italians were sharing meals with th greek soldiers,btohqsg
Cuz they both where axis aligned..,btohqsg
The serbs(except the partisans) were quite also,btohqsg
I think they just got sick of Serbia getting so much attention,btohqsg
They be like eh they started the first one this time let us have some fun starting the second one,btohqsg
