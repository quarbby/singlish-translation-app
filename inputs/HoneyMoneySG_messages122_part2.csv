Hi all  will I be able to get miles if I use atome to pay for my Agoda booking  using the uob ladys card with travel category,btohqsg
Hello all! Which trading platform is best for buying Msia Bursa stocks? TIA!,btohqsg
hi all  if i were to do DCA weekly of $50 into S&P500 index  should i go for US or UK domicile?i read and watch that UK domicile is more for buying large amount of shares so its more worth for the fees. but i intend to do DCA only as i do not have large sum to throw in,btohqsg
dont have enough $$$ to max out any of them,btohqsg
Then why do you want to keep more than 20k in chocolate finance,btohqsg
its aspect is similar to moomoo MMF   that amount that i going to put is like ~1k? not like 50k HAHAH,btohqsg
Uuh sure I guess since itâ€™s your money. Just thinking why will you risk your money for something against something that are guaranteed that gives more or similar interest,btohqsg
i mean if i had 150k will put in UOB one for 4% but dont have enough savings cause just started working 1 year  I also wish i can max out all HYSA ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Can I use ipaymy to pay income tax monthly?,btohqsg
I havenâ€™t max out any of them either  but I rather put my money in ocbc or uob to slowly build it up. Albeit mmf are low to no risk  thereâ€™s still a risk. Especially you said you started working for 1 year  capital is your priorityNot a financial advise but you do you,btohqsg
For chocolate finance  if I put in $50k  does the first $20k still get 4.2%?,btohqsg
Also  the remaining $30k will be at 3.5% pa?,btohqsg
So for the $30k  what interest rate would that be?,btohqsg
Targeted at 3.5% but it varies each day ya. Can go negative.,btohqsg
yea theres still a risk if thats your concern  but 3% in UOB one vs 3.5~ in moomoo cashplus or ~3.5 in chocofinance which the underlying funds i have read the funds they are buying and the contents of those funds   which they are using a custodian account also. So the risk is also considerably low,btohqsg
For small amounts can look at roboadvisors instead since the fees will not be significant,btohqsg
More of endowus/syfe and the likesðŸ’°FINANCIAL APPSðŸ’°ðŸ”—https://hmsg.link/finance,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSGand others wouldnt this promotion result in 6+% benefit as well assuming we put in MMF like Fullerton?,btohqsg
Deposits in UOB One is SDIC insured. Funds in MooMoo cash plus and chcofinance are considered as investment with a level of risk to be accepted. On their page  they also pointed that their investment should not be treated as deposits.,btohqsg
thanks. so if i buy VOO from Syfe brokerage  issit okay for small amount DCA?,btohqsg
Syfe trade is fine within the free trade limits,btohqsg
Don't combine stock vouchers with MMF returns (though i know what you mean),btohqsg
Hi Guys  HSBC EGA 5 eligible transaction can be all giro? No need to have any transaction through debit card?,btohqsg

Hi  can DBS vantage  UOB visa signature  UOB lady's or UOB preferred platinum visa earn miles when paying for SP electricity utility bills? Thank you,btohqsg
Why would you use amaze on Lazada and shopee when they're both online already? That's a waste of 1k domestic spend limit.,btohqsg
Hi. If I link my CRC to FairPrice apps and spend at kopitiam and FairPrice  will I get 4miles per dollar? Or it will need to spend through amaze,btohqsg
if u meant citi rewards card  should get 4mpd on fairprice app assuming NOT using google/apple pay in-app,btohqsg
Yes. I saved the card to FairPrice apps for payment,btohqsg
Hi all  what are your thoughts on the Astrea8 bond?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  anyone know any place for good lobangs for CDC vouchers?,btohqsg
Actually I am not sure can setup GIRO for Citi in DBS. Manual payment is possible. I didnt see Citibank as an option when I tried this (not even HSBC or UOB for that matter).,btohqsg
If i use my UOB One account to pay for credit card bills from other banks (e.g. Maybank/HSBC)  does this count towards the minimum $500 minimum spending for UOB One?,btohqsg
Any good credit card onboarding promotions this month?,btohqsg
How to check what charges/companies fall under which expense category? I rmb there was some merchant code tool or something,btohqsg
Hello i got questions with vouchers that you can buy from heymax such as amazon  lazada  grab  gojek etc. Example if i buy $100 voucher and redeem at said platform  do i need to buy items of same value of the voucher? Or it works like a wallet/balance.,btohqsg
Depends on vouchers. Just check their tnc. For example  klook one is balance while tada one is offset the ride cose.,btohqsg

Not sure  but I spent on Singapore Mint online and it is counted.,btohqsg
Any bro can advise the best uob card for hospital bill?,btohqsg
I don't think any local credit cards can be use for hospital bill. Correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg

Heymex suggested HSBC Advance card for 2.5% cashback. Really can trust Heymax?,btohqsg
MoneySmartSg suggested UOB One card.... err....,btohqsg
TnC of hsbc advance exclude mcc 8062 hospital,btohqsg
outdated le  refer to the card's TnC,btohqsg
