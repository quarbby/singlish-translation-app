Just curious about sth uh ... does anyone have bank account overseas ?  just curious how student go US  UK and Australia to study and pay their school fees,btohqsg
You see   study overseas requires lots of money and it will not be desirable to pay by cash Ôºü,btohqsg
Go there work odd jobs to pay loan,btohqsg
Parents mortgage the house for you to take loan,btohqsg
Cannot get uk/usa job..don't dare come homeü§ê,btohqsg
Yup my mentor told me his CS degree cost 5k in UK currency per semester ahh I see,btohqsg
So ppl just loan and return later on,btohqsg
In particular I think US education system is a scam when it comes to offering useless degree courses.,btohqsg
Lmao ü§£ u better don't anyhow say here ok,btohqsg
You must rephrase..all unis is a good school tag to the company regulations üòÑ,btohqsg
But if you compared the cost to sg..obviously sg is more expensive that's why more students are going to other countries to explore other unis instead,btohqsg
U can set up a bank account overseas as long as you have a proof of address for most banks,btohqsg
He's classified as a Home/EU student,btohqsg
I think u forget to add housing food living and being a foreigner tax ah,btohqsg
even without those  sg uni still isn't even that expensive,btohqsg
Have to see what countries..I know Japan sponsor foreignersü§ê,btohqsg
I mean as a foreigner it is kinda ig but ya there are grants to offset the cost,btohqsg
It's comparable to other Asian Unis and we have a better reputation,btohqsg
