3 weeks in/15 trading days into the Falconer system and the results have been really consistent. Honestly  if they continue to play by the rules and parameters  we can expect this system to last longer than what skeptics think. If keen  can follow the below channel to monitor the daily results  before you decide.https://t.me/falconersg,btohqsg

Yea  waiting for you join me  will treat you to a good shaving 🪒,btohqsg
Try to cash out  see if their system start to change from profit to loss.Saw on news the other day. Apparently there are many similar platform. However some work by scamming investor to pump in more and more money when they see profit. And when they pumped in a lot and want to cash out their huge profit  the profit suddenly changed to losses. And also investor will need to top up money to “pay capital tax” “admin fee” etc when they want to cash out. By the time they eventually managed to cash out  their profile will be at a huge loss liao.Maybe at the early stage they still try to gain your trust in the system. But sometimes really 见好就收Hope u found a genuine one,btohqsg

If Singapore extend phase 2 HA on Monday  sheng Siong will chiong?,btohqsg
How to extend HA when it doesn’t end on Monday,btohqsg
Maybe MTF will announce something about extension on Monday. They are at midpoint review. Moreover don’t think they will decide to announce extension at the last minute. Normally rhey will tell weeks in advanced. Like CB last year,btohqsg
Why leh.. it’s not even pumped up,btohqsg
"Many ""punters' have taken the positions that ppes will chiong when they see regional covid cases surge. But never see the ever increasing capacity and that big markets  US  Europe and China are either improving or stable.",btohqsg
Now Europe and USA seems to be doing fine. Asian like Malaysia  Taiwan  India  Philippines  and many of our neighbors seem to be struggling. Don’t think our government will loosen up so soon. Probably defensive stock like Sheng Siong or medical still have some leg up in the near term,btohqsg
Ikr 🤤🤤 Only $5.50 for a set!! 😋😭,btohqsg
You tried before? Anyone tried?I see the crusty pastry shit I cannot tahan sia!! Super love!!🔥😍😵‍💫😭,btohqsg
India big mkt....but anything cheap to them is good....so u give them good quality ones they say expensive  no mkt.,btohqsg
That's very true.. they have the numbers but they are very price sensitive,btohqsg
Haven't tried it  gonna jiak it if I pass by after phase 2 😋 I love crispy pastry too man,btohqsg
Medical  if your meaning is not gloves and PPEs then is alright. Don’t think those counters can see their high point again,btohqsg
Yes .. as long dun open border completely can liao,btohqsg
My interpretation of it is  sufficient measures means they will not tighten measure and definitely no CB.. But it doesn’t rule out possibility of extension of current state by another 2 weeks or 1 month. Why would they give money $800m to businesses affected if the current phase 2HA measure is only 1 month (until 13 June)? The impact to businesses small if only for 1 month. Government can happily go back phase 2 or phase 3 without having to give out ang bao. But now I think they see the severity and give out first handout first. Because they will want to extend.Some catalyst for extension are:- today got 23 community cases and 4 unlink again. Unlink can easily form a cluster. And boom. Out of control like what we see in Early May.- new variant is aerosol and can spread thru air. Mask off activities like dine out and sports will not be ready to be open yet. Working from home will still be default mode since current measure  government don’t have to payout to everyone.  it’s liken to a CB  can control spread also. Win win for the government.- neighboring countries sibei jialat. Up north our Neighbour in full lock down announced yesterday. If their covid situation can explode  so can ours. And it’s suspect to be the more transmissible Indian variant.- school holiday now. Target children. Si ghina will all go out shopping if restriction is loosen now. Then all efforts wasted again.- May is not a good month for stock from past years. Susceptible to sell down. Like the scare on 14 May. Sheng Siong or medical stocks are good hedge.My opinions ...,btohqsg
Maybe go up a bit. 5-10% kind possible ba. Short term. I also don’t expect it to go back to its heydays man,btohqsg
They still opening to imports. They have to open because many companies still need workers. That’s the thing. Indian variant very viral. So can only tighten measures locally,btohqsg
It’s more of a speculative stock now; I wouldn’t rate those as defensive,btohqsg
Short term maybe have some play but likely die at resistance again,btohqsg
Daily   weekly  monthly all pumped up already,btohqsg

"""The ISM Manufacturing PMI fell to 60.7 in April of 2021 from 64.7 in March  well below market forecasts of 65 as shortages of inputs likely constrained production. Still  the latest reading pointed to expansion in the manufacturing sector for the 11th month. A slowdown was seen in production (62.5 vs 68.1)  new orders (64.3 vs 68) and employment (55.1 vs 59.6) while inventories contracted (46.5 vs 50.8). On the other hand  new export orders increased faster (54.9 vs 54.5). All of the six biggest manufacturing industries expanded  in the following order: Fabricated Metal Products; Chemical Products; Food  Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Transportation Equipment; and Petroleum & Coal Products.""",btohqsg
