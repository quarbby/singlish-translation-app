Oooo recently new stun by grab.,btohqsg
Think they lost a lot of rider,btohqsg
Rain plus flood. Lack of coolies,btohqsg
Grab must be thinlking everyday how to kill off deliveroo panda n llm,btohqsg
Kill off deliveroo  Panda and LLM. At the same time suck driver / rider dry dry.,btohqsg
Grab will never kill off deliveroo  panda or LLm. Our garmen must let other country know we are an open country. 1 company cannot bao ga liao. must have 2 or more to play around... Just like Certis cisco n Aetos... BOth are Garmen,btohqsg
If grab monopolise. Will be like our petrol.even Whole world dropping petrol price will still go up.,btohqsg
So all riders should boycott grab before it's too late,btohqsg
Ah Tan already just bought a GCB. Very lich liao,btohqsg
Wacow the jew who Kia duno how to book llm🤣...,btohqsg
The ryde driver is a asshole,btohqsg
Everything also wanna record n post.,btohqsg

https://www.facebook.com/1631826980245346/posts/4279418015486216/Wacow die die must buy Tesla liao .Flood no fear,btohqsg
Lol..than ur battery cui water damage,btohqsg
So bad 4 orders...spent 5.5hours..u need to learn how to stack..Town cbd area i dunno if still alot this period..EgChinatown tanjong pagar marina(except MBS) area to ;Tanjong katong marine parade areaReason:direct route to ecp to and froAbove same area to keppel and telok blangahReason:direct route to and fro,btohqsg
Do you take bike order to stack too?,btohqsg
The jizz is...Learn ur routes ar..i cannot teach this skill..When picking orders I will look at PU and drop off area..,btohqsg
If high value..+6 +8 +10 +12..,btohqsg
If not i cant be bothered...,btohqsg
So normally stack with car order?,btohqsg
If to drop off difference of $1-2 i will stack..better than 1 order..usually during peak period,btohqsg
$21 car order + $19 bike order..,btohqsg
I wont be bothered with below $16 bike orders,btohqsg
Like that have to go CBD all the time,btohqsg
See if u heng or not,btohqsg
Lol..i do CBD..i dont do other area unless im ard the area..,btohqsg
Another things is you need to be near CBD then you will see more orders?,btohqsg
Not so..but ur ratio of getting the orders is higher..within 3km radius of PU,btohqsg
No wonder I swipe 15 times also can’t get knn,btohqsg
If ur out of the area u still able to see..but limited choices..the nicer choices when ur nearer the area,btohqsg
I work 1 day almost wanna give up ...,btohqsg
But if ur the type who die2 need to depend goggle map to go around cbd area..than gg,btohqsg
Route is ok for me is about getting jobs,btohqsg
In cbd area i dont need goggle map..unless its a unfamilliar area..which is low cause i only take PU from famillar usual places,btohqsg
Monday I waited at woodland ind maybe that’s why,btohqsg
Ur new  if u wanna trt CBD area..need to effort to familliarise in the area for 3 weeks min,btohqsg
Off course la..woodlands area bulk of the orders come from the senoko food hub,btohqsg
I swear to myself never take from there again,btohqsg
Make me wait long long and fare not as good,btohqsg
Yes I will go CBD more often,btohqsg
I stay hougang...i never go ubi..i cannot wait and hang around,btohqsg
MPV orders sucks..heavy stuffs + cheapos cust..,btohqsg

I heard from my friend Ubi used to be good but that was last year,btohqsg
For LLM  mainly on food delivery. Head to those places where there are cafes  central kitchen  restoran etc.,btohqsg
I cant say much abt ubi..but tai seng has alot of food hub and niche bakery..,btohqsg
Yes. I also don't chiong there. Now I love this particular restaurant. Always have car order wan. 😂,btohqsg
Another alternative is  u know where are the home based chef located.. Go to that area. May hit jackpot.,btohqsg
Sultan gate bugis little india (only swee choon and meat smith )marina boulevard tanjong pagar chinatown(no hawkers no pagado street eateries) tiong bahru  robertson quay,btohqsg
If fare is good I don’t mind,btohqsg
Wait for peak hour. All the ++ comes out.,btohqsg
I do 1 time food delivery from llm $34 but 3 drops and took me 1hr 20min to do including waiting at Pu area,btohqsg
Alot of spots to park for awhile to smoke and lim kopi inside car..in between lull hours.,btohqsg

For the law to be enforced on the platform provider  it doesn't mean the delivery worker has to be contracted and work on their schedule.If it is the same conditions as contract  then people might as well go work for MCD or Pizza Hut delivery. Better pay and benefits  got free meal too.,btohqsg
