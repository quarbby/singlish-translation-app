Please .. share what exactly is this about and what is your agenda. if you mention very vaguely everyone will have doubts. just post charts / evidence of good performance and you will get supporters. what site  what company  what company  how safe is capital. all this you can just say.,btohqsg
Short answer: To challenge the existing signals providers (especially the paid ones)  to motivate new traders by showing them that it’s possible to predict the market to certain extent and to show off 😜,btohqsg
Even shorter answer: for the fun of it 😂,btohqsg
But good to be wary because there are too many scammers. If you are not wary  then it shows that the results of my algorithm sucks.,btohqsg

What we are doing here is to create a monthly premium of say a range of $30-$60 It is based on the premiums you’re getting. We cover all sorts of repairs and transportation of the damaged Ebike. For example  client A has a basic insurance plan which costs $30  he has a tyre punctured  he can bring to us at any point of time to get it repair. Another example will be client B has a premium insurance package which costs $60  and he has a spoilt motor (higher cost price)  we will go to him at any part of Singapore to get it done for him. We have specialised repair man. The complication in the repair depends how sever is the damaged done. We could also come out with VIP premium that costs $80 a month? Which means if the Ebike is lost or totally out of repair  we will replace a new Ebike for them.,btohqsg

i need your opinion guys....govt has announced that in 2023 all goods imported into singapore by air or post will kana gst regardless of its value....currently if value less than $400 never kana gst....does this mean once jb border open i go jb buy groceries worth $80 then come back sg still kana gst?,btohqsg
I think u don’t think too much…. Don’t even know 2023 borders will open or not lol,btohqsg
$80 of groceries is only $5.6 gstDon’t think they will create even more admin and jam just for average of such amount for each personI paid gst before for higher amount at causeway and it’s very time consuming for the officials,btohqsg
no its not abt the amt have to pay.....just wanna know if tats a regulation now because i dun wanna spend 2 hours in a jam and another hour queueing up to pay gst at the ica counter when the border opens....i think borders shud be opened by mid 2023 latest,btohqsg
they have novovax now and ivermectin,btohqsg
thats my point.it won't happen for groceries.,btohqsg
btw this is an investment chatgroup hahahahi actually thought u asking this because u are thinking of property values in JB or WoodlandsLOL,btohqsg
