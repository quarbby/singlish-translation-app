i read they cambridge outsource their markers to china and india,btohqsg
eh wait no isnt mt marked locally,btohqsg
so maybe the general MT papers are marked locally but the more intensive like chinese studies etc are not,btohqsg
The funniest part is Art is marked locally,btohqsg
as if we have a comparable art scene to the rest of the world,btohqsg
Hopefully you guys not going to join politics  after getting rejected by an art institution.,btohqsg

i bully the instructor last time,btohqsg
he asked me to put the food inside my clothes that will make me look pregnant,btohqsg

and see kampong hse and slumps,btohqsg
honestly not all are entitled  i mean we’re js unlucky if u see it from our pov,btohqsg
all our exams are new syllabus and mostly its way tougher than previous papers 💀,btohqsg
new syllabus does not mean harder paper,btohqsg
r u even 07? if youre not then u shldnt compare 😁🙏🏽,btohqsg
in fact i was meeting with my sec sch teachers they said that it was expected,btohqsg
is just that alot of yall expected the paper to follow past trends so when it doesnt all of a sudden yall cannot adapt,btohqsg
nope but many of my 07 friends have said that it was an easy paper u just need to think more,btohqsg
I’m surprised that the o level papers were that hard,btohqsg
isnt that an indirect way of calling those who think its hard stupid 💀,btohqsg
and that the n level ones are somehow easy,btohqsg
aka the batch that complains the most about oh they are being selectively spotted by cambridge to be a guinea pig for hard test papers,btohqsg
Did the bell curve give you a good grade,btohqsg
don’t worry there’s a bell curve,btohqsg
Does the bell curve exist for math,btohqsg
no it just means yall dont actually know what yall are studying,btohqsg
yall are studying to take the test vs even understanding the content in the first place.if you understnad the content u can apply it to any context,btohqsg
Nothing that was tested in the papers were out of syllabus,btohqsg
i mean like its not like all of them found every qn hard,btohqsg
If thats the case then why yall complaining so much,btohqsg
complain about the question lah not the whole paper 💀,btohqsg
those that complain abt the whole paper clearly nvr study,btohqsg
theres people complaining abt the whole paper,btohqsg
