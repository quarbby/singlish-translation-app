Hey everyone!What do you do when there is a train service disruption during your national examinations?In the event of a train service disruption during your examinations  it is essential to be well-prepared. You may refer to instructions for PSLE and GCE-Level Examination candidates affected by a train service disruption from SEAB‚Äôs website.Alternatively  you may refer to this link:https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/train-disruption-advice.,btohqsg
EWL services will continue to be disrupted tmr,btohqsg
There are so many cops at Buona vista,btohqsg
I think there are more cops than SMRT people,btohqsg

sounds like another grab day to pulau ntu,btohqsg
but i'm conducting midterm lol fuck,btohqsg
where's iestin. should've asked to crash his room today,btohqsg
#PSAüö® No train service between Jurong East and Buona Vista stations tomorrow  26 Sept 2024.As there was extensive damage to the tracks  more time is required to do the necessary repairs and replacements. We will also check all first-generation Kawasaki Heavy Industries trains overnight  before they are put into service.‚û°Ô∏è Check out this visual for info on the alternative travel options tomorrow. Thank you for your understanding.,btohqsg
Very unfortunate for those taking PSLE.,btohqsg
5 teens have been arrested after footage of a Qihua Primary School student being assaulted by an older boy emerged online earlier this week.https://cna.asia/3MZS9jQ,btohqsg
#PSAüö® There will be no rail service between Jurong East and Buona Vista stations tomorrow  27 Sep.We explored running a shuttle service between these stations to restore partial service. However  as this would slow down track repairs  we will prioritise repairing and restoring full service earlier.SMRT is aiming to resume normal operations on Monday  30 Sept 2024.‚û°Ô∏è Check out this visual for more info on the travel options available during this period.Thank you for your understanding. üôèüèº,btohqsg
Around 17 000 youth in Singapore were not in school  work or training last year  representing 4.1% of youth in the country.Mr Fabian Ang was once a troubled youth who dropped out of secondary school. Read about how he found support:https://str.sg/Cvke,btohqsg
whoever this is  i feel both pity and admiration for you,btohqsg
plus r u honestly that free wtf,btohqsg
How was yall guys grad for the sec 4/5s,btohqsg
$50 for a grab is no joke. anyway ntu students don't have class next week so if he was alr done with tests then yea he's that free,btohqsg
but the shuttle bus at buona vista  it's efficient even if it's not fast,btohqsg
on my way back (buona to jurong direction) today around 1900 hrs  people taking the shuttle to jurong east were made to queue in 2 lines to enter the bus,btohqsg
and by the time my shuttle departed  there were 3 ewl shuttles behind also queueing and waiting for boarding,btohqsg
even if the journey itself is slowed overall  I think the response was quite good,btohqsg
I mean  the sustainable response is fixing the derailed train,btohqsg
just now otw back on grab past clementi,btohqsg
fr? it was quite packed when I was going back,btohqsg
shuttle/bridging buses more consistent now i tbink,btohqsg
ya i think it was like 7.40pm,btohqsg
if you look back on the day or the day after the incident of the EWL disruption itself  it was probably more hellish,btohqsg
it's been 2 days at least now,btohqsg
ya I was quite shocked when I couldn't go back to the ewl,btohqsg
at the time they bridged between buona vista and boon lay I think,btohqsg
i am fortunate enough to be able to avoid disruptions lol,btohqsg
but tbh the bridging service is confusing,btohqsg
so is thr a boon lay queenstown direct,btohqsg
but it was damn packed  at buona it's empty  then at dover you can't even get on,btohqsg
