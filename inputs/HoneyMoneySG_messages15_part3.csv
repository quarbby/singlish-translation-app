Oof ok thx! I thought I can just buy $1 worthüòÖ,btohqsg
Hi Chris  think most of us had already signed up for Citi cards since this group had been actively promoting. Dun get me wrong  I would like to support you (which I had for the recent CIMB Card promo link). In terms of getting the bang for your buck in terms of affiliate referrals  the lesser known cards like from CIMB or BOC for example might give better mileage for your effort. My 2 cents. Thanks!,btohqsg

provided not excluded e.g. uob$ merchants,btohqsg
Hi guys  any Revolut card user here? Would like to clarify if the funds in the e-wallet can be transfer back to your bank acc? Thanks! If I‚Äôm not wrong  YouTrip is unable to perform the above,btohqsg

Revolu very particular of those better beware later u gets banned & Lock üîê out,btohqsg
As much as I'd love to  these lesser known cards don't offer referral programmes,btohqsg
For the $2K sgd deposit even if I were to convert some to usd and make the trade and I have less than $2K sgd it‚Äôll still qualify right?,btohqsg
Correct. As long as you don't make any withdrawals,btohqsg
Anyone else facing issues with UOB‚Äôs credit card application processing? Been one month and no communication. Call their helpline  waiting for 1 hour  nobody answers. Chat assist folks tell me I will receive callback and nobody calls back (happened thrice). Any ideas what I can do? I‚Äôm trying to move away from DBS live fresh and to EVOL. But seems impossible with UOB‚Äôs inefficiency right now‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Gg just when I wanan sign,btohqsg
Yeah faced similar issues  but they did callback and i got sms saying card approved but after that no further info  so overall quite bad,btohqsg
Maybe end of year alot of backlog,btohqsg
Got ppls complaining of hsbc Citi too,btohqsg
Scb amex is fastest I feel,btohqsg
