Anyone knows today's olvl oral topic,btohqsg
can i ask  how is life after Ns for a NA student? How would he/she move on after Ns?,btohqsg
As in entering NS after N levels?,btohqsg
o.0?! I don‚Äôt think that is possible,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs talking about national service,btohqsg
The common answer is probably Sec 5 -> JC -> Uni,btohqsg
But Poly -> Uni is viable too,btohqsg
5N into JC is usually quite low,btohqsg
Depending on your current academic ability and stuff like that  you would pick your path accordingly,btohqsg
Say u r a god at maths and chem  then u would probably want to go to JC through sec 5 cause JC rewards being very good at academics,btohqsg
But if u r not the academic sort  and prefer learning through application  you would want to go through poly instead,btohqsg
I mean I come from a neighbourhood Sec Sch into a neighbourhood JC. Both the number of Sec 5 in my Sec Sch that ended up in JC  and the number of people in my JC that were in NA is quite low.,btohqsg
Not say don‚Äôt have  but low.,btohqsg
What do you want to know about it? I can help answer for 5Na qns as I'm formally an N level student. I went to sec 5 and rn in IB,btohqsg
I meant it as a response to ‚Äòsmooth route to uni‚Äô,btohqsg
Most people will tell you to go JC if u want to go Uni,btohqsg
i guess it depends on what u wna do and how well did you do academically,btohqsg
They say 70% local U intake is JC (iirc)  but they don‚Äôt tell you how many in JC don‚Äôt make it to Uni,btohqsg
My class only 7 made it to jc others go poly haha,btohqsg
Why are you Chem Math Geog guy now,btohqsg
and the course you want to enter,btohqsg
If they don‚Äôt? What would be your combi,btohqsg
I mean if they accept your appeal,btohqsg
Oh I was trying to help my sis find some viable options. She slacked off primary school so she paid the price. I want to help her and I can see shes working harder,btohqsg
I will pretend that i never heard that qn,btohqsg
If she manage to enrol in PFP i would be happy for her,btohqsg
But if she cant make it how?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why need to plan lah,btohqsg
Nope as a brother I want to help her,btohqsg
What level your sis in now?,btohqsg
To be frank shes not academically inclined but Singapore emphasises so much on ____. So I am trying to help her get the best?,btohqsg
Does she know what she wanna do yet?,btohqsg
Is she aware of courses that would allow her to pursue that career?,btohqsg
Shes in NA  so PFP is limited,btohqsg
Ok  if not PFP or Sec 5 then there‚Äôs only ite left,btohqsg
You do not start by asking her what scheme she wanna aim for  you start with the end in mind. Where does she want to be  then chart the route there through the schemes.,btohqsg
This is how I helped my Brother. He was like I want to go PFP  I ask what course he say don‚Äôt know  just say teacher say PFP is easier than Sec 5. You want to help her  help her find her end goal not the route to nowhere.,btohqsg
He ended up DPP into Elect Eng btw,btohqsg
CPIB would like to know ur location,btohqsg
Does she take Art in N levels,btohqsg
I am studying Sec 5 at Bedok view planning to go to DHS,btohqsg
R e j e c t e d!!,btohqsg
So I would say  now I just help her get the best aggregate? The rest is in her hands,btohqsg
But tbh u shld be lowkey on such stuff,btohqsg
Help her see the score she need by asking her to aim for a course she want with her career goal/int in mind.,btohqsg
She said specialising in making perfumes,btohqsg
Like just aimlessly trying your best is not likely to yield the best.,btohqsg
At first i was so shocked to hear,btohqsg
You need to see something at stake.,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt there a poly course that‚Äôs specifically about perfume making,btohqsg
ok i go shower lmao  come back see yall reply,btohqsg
SP Perfumery and Cosmetic Science should be the course,btohqsg
I‚Äôm proud to say that he replied to me on Reddit HAHA,btohqsg
I‚Äôm going through his comment history trying to postulate which one is you. Hmm are you among those he deem amicable or public enemy? Hahaha,btohqsg
Oh okay  I think she knows. Now she just need me to push her and and teach her if she dont know. I hope all will turn out good,btohqsg

Its a vacuum cleaner cleaning the vacuum cleaner,btohqsg
But then isnt it also a vacuum cleaner because you clean the vacuum cleaner,btohqsg
If you vacuum your vacuum cleaner  then it's a vacuum,btohqsg
That means it has zero-point energy,btohqsg
And you can't precisely determine its position and momentum simultaneously,btohqsg
