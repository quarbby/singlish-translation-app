Hii  just needed advice. Iâ€™m a j1 student currently. Iâ€™m failing chemistry and Iâ€™m not quite sure why. Iâ€™m doing well for my other subjects. For Mid years  I managed to get A for everything but U for chem. So I know I need to spend more time on chemistry but Iâ€™m not sure how. I failed because of my answering techniques and not my content. Are there any tips yâ€™all have on how I can master the answering techniques in chemistry??,btohqsg
if you're failing based on answering techniques and not content then i suggest you can pick up like your school's exam answer sheets and compare it to your own answers you wrote during the exam and figure out what's the disparity.,btohqsg
That and also like Kuro said  spam consult to ask about how to succinctly answer questions better from your chem teacher,btohqsg
get ready for a 'HOLY SHIT WTF' suicide story on mothership,btohqsg
in all honesty and very frankly  if you get a U  I believe that it has something to do with your content too. Because even if you anyhow write write something just to smoke and fill in the blank  it should be D to S and also those recall kind of questions in MCQ/P1,btohqsg
Okay thank you to those that helped!!,btohqsg
Oi guys  I want to know the transition of chemistry from o level pure Chem to h2 chem,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ ok honestly it is manageable. Itâ€™s kinda fun but like you really have to pay attention.,btohqsg
Um wellâ€¦ If u have the interest for it Iâ€™m sure ull grasp it easily,btohqsg
I donâ€™t have any interest in it  but chemistry is one of the easiest subject for me.,btohqsg
So I had a thought of taking chemistry in jc,btohqsg
How about u do some research like during ur free time on the topics tested,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything wrong w asking,btohqsg
Itâ€™s always good to start early and plan ahead,btohqsg
