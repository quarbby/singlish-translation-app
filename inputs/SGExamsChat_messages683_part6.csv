Yea I rmbed it was like 2019 and then it happened.,btohqsg
Like poly guys were complaining why dont have concession but jc or ite students have,btohqsg
poly have their own card ah,btohqsg
And then they reduce poly bus fares in the expense of increasing jc and other student bus prices,btohqsg
i rmb when i tap my student concession card and heard the single beep my heart sank,btohqsg
then after i go to the machine and scan card got double beep again,btohqsg
poly still got student fares or got their own fares,btohqsg
it‚Äôll be that sound for most of your life,btohqsg
this moment i realise i taking advantage of $0.65+ fares too much,btohqsg
i take $2 to get to campus,btohqsg
not if you have a car üåö,btohqsg
Take the time to breathe the air of discount student bus fares.,btohqsg
even more pain bc of petrol and coe,btohqsg
Coz need to activate it w the machine first,btohqsg
but the few trips before i did my ezlink balance ran out so fast,btohqsg
nowadays i just transfer $110 monthly to my other bank card,btohqsg
i think i might need it in the future,btohqsg
i took a bus for 5 stops b4 and it costed me nearly $1,btohqsg

it was when i havent activate my ite card yet then my sec sch ezlink concession expired alr,btohqsg
i just estimated my transport as $4 a day,btohqsg
i will just live as a homeless man on campus,btohqsg
and the govt increasing bus/train fares each year üò≠,btohqsg
i mean sg transport is considered cheap alr,btohqsg
