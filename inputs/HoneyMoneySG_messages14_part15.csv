Hello! Not sure if this has been answered  but I have always had a question about CC fee waivers. Most banks will charge you the fee first  then you need to request a waiver (year 2 onwards generally). Despite all strategies  if they reject your fee waiver  and you cancel the CC immediately  are you still charged the fee? Or do they reverse it? Or is it pro-rated?,btohqsg
Thank you! but the website seems to be stuck after i enter my email,btohqsg
They will just not charge you and say goodbye,btohqsg
Note that you can‚Äôt request waiver before they charge you first. So they charge you first  then you cancel. Would they reverse it?,btohqsg
Ya most of the time is like that,btohqsg
But nowadays waiver requests are automated. Hardly any gets rejected. If they do  you call manually,btohqsg
I'll try to get the credit card fee waiver video by tonight,btohqsg
Need to remove adblock or use incognito,btohqsg

Do we hv to pay more using UOB Absolute Cashback card to pay income tax on monthly basis?Eg admin fee,btohqsg
I think theres a video about it - use UOB Absolute to top up GrabPay Mastercard. Then go to an AXS Station or use app to pay tax using the Grab Pay Mastercard,btohqsg
There is a max limit of $500 per transaction to pay on AXS app or website,btohqsg
My first time also. It‚Äôs the longest time I spent standing at an ATM. Need to choose a ton of options and hit ‚ÄúNext‚Äù or ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù a million times. But still better than waiting 30-60mins at a branch üòÆ‚Äçüí®,btohqsg
