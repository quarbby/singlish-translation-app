If you are 20 to 30 years old  use it to learn a high income skill. If you are 30+ years old  consider investing in growth stocks. If you are 40+â€¦ you should have many $10k around,btohqsg
$10k just nice for moomoo welcome offer +5.8% p.a. returnhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/117075,btohqsg
Hmm whatâ€™s the 5.8% interest thing?,btohqsg
Hi for the SMART Park 30-day 5.8% return  if I deposit on 30th August and hold it  do I get 5.8% daily until 29th September?,btohqsg
He say you all donâ€™t know one la ðŸ˜‚ but nope not listening to him.,btohqsg
Yes  30 day starts from your deposit date,btohqsg
if u signed up for that  its 0.058 * 10 000 * (30/365) if i got the formula correct,btohqsg
only through the transaction history then can see if really got enrolled into smart park?,btohqsg
better not listen to ur friend ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I will test out smart park myself over the week then comment,btohqsg
Does this mean if i deposit 10k with 5 buy trades and hold for 30 days i will get all the 3 rewards?,btohqsg
I think somebody shared before. Moomoo ways of handling the promo is you need to click the coupon before depositing your money. Or else you canâ€™t earn the rewards.,btohqsg
Yes  for a new to moomoo user,btohqsg
Anyone know if I can earn online 4mpd bonus miles plus krispay 6mpd miles at the dentist using dbs wwmc with krispay?,btohqsg

Maribank only 2.5%. I rather use SIF GoSavers which is 2.5% min but got higher tier interest,btohqsg
i only sign up maribank for fun since only though invitations,btohqsg
Uob lady bonus point is in for me for jul spending,btohqsg
Lol if you had that much cash to hit the higher tiers  there are much better privilege/ priority/ private banking options out thereLike if you put $200k in SIF GoSavers its effective 2.75% pa (2.5% first 100k  3.0% next 100k)$200k in UOB Privilege is a 3.50% flat for all $200k (without promo),btohqsg
Hi  is citipayall count under new comer clocking?,btohqsg
Hi guys...im new here...just wanna ask u guys...im new to scb credit card...can i know how to withdraw cash from scb atm or other atm such as posb or uob or ocbc???,btohqsg
U will incur high interest cash advance rate and fee if u withdraw cash from any atm with your credit card,btohqsg
It does not count under new to bank user spending criteria.,btohqsg
Lets say i withdraw 500 around how much i need to pay back??,btohqsg
U will need to see the card fee and charges and i dont think it is a good way to get 500 via cash advance unless it is your last options,btohqsg
But how to withdraw cash at the first place?? I tried but cant...,btohqsg
U need to have available credit limit with credit card  any atm should be able withdraw but u need the pin that bank send u,btohqsg
Already change my own pin...a 5 digit pin...,btohqsg
But atm should have 6 digit pin right??,btohqsg
But y they ask to change a 5 digit pin,btohqsg
There is alot of charges in the small print  please know what u are getting into before doing cash advance. If u hold a mastercard  as long as they havr the mastercard logo u can withdraw. Same goes to visa card  as long as atm have visa logo u can withdraw,btohqsg
The interest start kick in from the moment u withdraw it can range from 25 percent to 30 percent per annum range  compound daily i think. Do read your card term and condition.,btohqsg
Where you get this info? Can share with me?,btohqsg
Sign up for1) Cash Plus AccountOr2) Cash Management AccountNo harm to sign up for allFacilities?,btohqsg
Better to sign up for Cash Management. Cash Plus got inactivity fee $15/quarter,btohqsg
Yes  you can draw $ from uob 1,btohqsg
When do I get credited for the uob one interest ?,btohqsg
I think not yet. Maybe later part of the day,btohqsg
Hi all  july is my first month using UOB one account. I had full 100k from 1-31 July  and fulfilled both salary + $500 spend. Any idea why I only got $420.62 bonus int + $4.25 base int?,btohqsg
Interest is calculated daily not monthly. Jul has 31 days.$100k x 5% x (31/365),btohqsg
My bad  I thought 5% EIR = $500 interest in a month. Havenâ€™t woke up properly. Thank you!!,btohqsg
Hi  May I check  my UOB one account. Only receive these 2 interest. Will there be more interest?,btohqsg
Hi  May I check  u receive how many interest deposit? I only got 2 lines of interest deposit.,btohqsg
