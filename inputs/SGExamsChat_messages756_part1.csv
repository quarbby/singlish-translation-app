"How to get a partner during Poly Orientation!As poly orientation is starting on Monday for many of us  some may be nervous and not know what to do to acquire some bitches. Perchance. Thus  I have carefully curated a survival guide for Poly Orientation  equipped with all the social skills you need as well as some ways to impress all the hoes  and potentially get you laid (100% real strategy!)For men :1. Greet every girl with ""where my hug at?"" This will let them see your affectionate and more feminine side. Women love that! üòç2. When a girl goes to the toilet  always reply with ""Without me?"" This lets the girl know that you'll always be there for them. üòÅ3. Be sure to follow girls to class! Extra close distance reassures them that you shall protect them from the big evil alpha wolves in your group üòàüòà4. Lastly  when a girl pulls out her phone you always take it! Be sure to scroll aggressively and ask her ""where yo hoes at?"" She'll be so attracted by your protective behaviour and fall in love with you! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èFor women :1. Always talk about how small and petite you are! This lets the big sigma ohio gyatt men know that you are in need of their protection üòã‚ÄºÔ∏è2. Constantly pursue the older OGL men! They'll think you're so mature for your age üëçüëçüëç3. Ask all the boys in your group if you're ugly. Make sure to twirl your hair while doing so  and Lim Jun Jie from Diploma in Business will rush in to reassure you!! Always compliment his secondary school glory days and you'll be in a relationship in no time üî•üî•üî•Now that I've bestowed upon yall my words of wisdom  we should expect a rise in teen pregnancies nationwide. Perchance.",btohqsg
