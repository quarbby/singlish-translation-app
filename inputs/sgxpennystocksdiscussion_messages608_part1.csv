🚀Pika World Update 10 Feb 2022🚀Equity markets were broadly higher on Wednesday as technology stocks led the way  with bond yields easing off their recent high. Markets are waiting for the inflation data today.The Nasdaq had made a remarkable comeback after slipping from 10% off its Nov high as bond yields soared this year. With the tech stocks valuation much lower than before  it appears some appetite is back.🕹Short-term Headwind remains⛽️Pika World remains cautious of heavy accumulation in a period where there could still be a pain for tech stocks should another set of hotcake inflation data arrive. Moreover  it could stoke fear that the Fed might be more aggressive to hike interest rates and reduce its balance sheet.We do not see the downward movement in 10-year treasury yield as a sustainable one. However  it is likely to be for a moment as some traders may have shorted the bond  which had fallen hard this year and see some short covering to lock in profits given the relatively high yield now.⏳Inflation data awaits🏀Market participants are keenly waiting for the inflation data  which is expected to show CPI rising 7.2% yearly in January. It is likely to surpass the high of 7% we had seen recently. If it is an apparent overshoot of inflation  fixed income traders can potentially see the prospect of a 10-year yield shooting for a 2% target decisively  creating downward pressure for technology stocks.📱Disney: The stars are aligned📽A better than expected quarterly earnings and revenue brought a smile to investors as Disney+ subscriber front meets expectations and the theme parks segment showed decent progress. That’s made up a bullish thesis for Disney shareholders.The theme park segment was the highlight. Disney today is still seen by many investors as a legacy media business  and its post-pandemic recovery for its theme park had not materialised for a long time in 2021. Thus  the theme park business rebound brings a good vibe as streaming success is on the future front.Pika World will remain side-lined on Disney after offloading from our portfolio in our slim-down process.It is 10 Feb  Thursday  9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York.Pika World wishes all friends a delightful and bon appetit breakfast.,btohqsg
