🎁Pika World Update 3 May 2022🎈🪜Equity markets on see-saw🔦The market had a good rally today  but it was like a tidal wave  swinging from positive to negative and only rallying strongly in the late trading session. On the backdrop of this is the rising Treasury yield for the 10-year  which hits above 3% on Monday. It is the first time since 2018.Usually  such a climb matters because it affects the borrowing cost for the US economy. The pace of such ascent has been the key source of worry for investors. Yields rose because the bond faced a sell-off. Recall the inverse relationship between bond prices and their yield.Some called it puzzling to see technology stocks rising with bond yield  but the sell-off in technology stocks had been far worse than other sectors  and a relief bounce on Monday wasn't as surprising.⏳The sky isn't clear yet⛏💵💸While a good Monday run is welcomed  the equity market is not out of the woods. Economic growth concerns continued to linger on two significant fronts. First  the latest financial data from the US showed persistent slowing economic activities  prompting many investors to believe that a self-induced recession is almost inevitable. This means a possible hard landing with the Fed's new monetary regime is set to constrain the economy further.On the other isle is the compounding effect of China's struggle to control Covid-19 breakout and the associated measures that dampen local consumption  a spillover effect on the global economy as major economies see China as an important market for their revenue.💵Treasury yield REAL return💰Another thing that matters is that the 10-year Treasury yield now offers REAL yield (as discussed in our previous update) for the first time since the Covid-19 Pandemic started. The negative real yield had motivated investors to choose riskier assets to gain a return in the past.However  with the Fed moving to tighten monetary policy to tame inflation  the motivation to take risks dilutes. Wednesday will be critical as market participants await the almost certain 0.5% rate increase and the less specific balance sheet runoff size.It is 3 May  Tuesday  7.30 am in Singapore and 7.30 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a profitable start to a great May ahead!,btohqsg
