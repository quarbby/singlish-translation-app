Hello! New to the miles game hence appreciate all advice. I am expecting wedding expenses in the upcoming month. UOB PRIV miles have the promo for up to 58k miles. Should i apply for that first to meet the requirements then subsequently apply for uob lady solitaire in the next few days? Will i be able to then move the miles earned from PRIV to uob lady? Thinking of retaining uob lady in the long run rather than PRIV,btohqsg
Hi guys  I just subscribe to HSBC GIF Ultra Short Duration Bond in Moomoo with my 1.8% yield for 30 days.Would like to check for the next 30 days  will my money be locked up or I can still use the money to buy stocks?Currently all my idle cash is in cash plus  and it does allow me to invest even though it is in the cash plus. Does it work the same for the HSBC GIF Ultra Short Duration Bond. Thanks all.,btohqsg

Hi Gurus  I am trying to pay for accoms booking onbooking.comup to around $6k. It seems that I cannot pay in SGD and only can pay in JPY. Any card to recommend for paying such foreign currency? both cashback and miles are ok to me TIA,btohqsg
For uob quarterly savings promotion  do I need to fill form before depositing fresh funds? Or the order doesn't matter?,btohqsg
U will get the bonus interest,btohqsg
there is a bracket of (min 50 cents) does it mean it will charge min 50 cents per transaction? if so only good for big purchases as well,btohqsg
Thanks. So as long as the credit date is within the same month should be safe yea,btohqsg
medium purchase. too small  high % amaze charge. too large  exceed CRMC cap. not easy üòÜ,btohqsg
so my understanding is correct of min 50 cents  eg i need to charge 50 dollars min at a time for it to be 1% charge?,btohqsg
anything below is not even 1 % but higher?,btohqsg
yup as long as card-linked local transactions,btohqsg
Hi  if i use citi rewards + amaze card to pay for my flights and hotel online  would it still be eligible for miles?,btohqsg
It exclude travel related expense mcc code. Online doesn‚Äôt change the mcc code.,btohqsg

Ok then I may have misread it,btohqsg

Hi  say on heymax recommended me to use UOB Absolute Cashback Card for my upcoming cruise trip. Would just like to check because the absolute cashback card has a 3.25% foreign currency fee but still a 1.7% cashback  so meaning i will be charged 3.25% on how much i spend and also cashback 1.7% on how mych i spent too right? Because the cashback doesnt take into account the fees.Also 1.7% cashback on overseas spend is on all category?With this  do you guys think its worthwhile still using absolute cashback on the cruise or will i be better off with my youtrip/amaze wallet?,btohqsg
How much are u spending for this cruise?,btohqsg
Dont really plan to spend but just in case,btohqsg
Mhmm does it have foreign fee? If so how much?,btohqsg
Hi.. I just starting using Amaze + citi rewards combo for a month now. Now that amaze is no longer a good option  what‚Äôs the best available option for me? Because there is a limitation to what transaction works for Citi rewards right?,btohqsg
Hi all ! Going to Japan soon   can I check what‚Äôs the card viable for rewards for topping up virtual suica card ? Does UOB VS still works ?,btohqsg
i still use Youtrip/travel cards  i calculated the FCF not worth vs the exchange rate different vs mainstream bank CC.,btohqsg
CRMC will just become an online-preferred card. There are UOB PPV  VS and Lady's for paywave all are 4mpd but with caveats to each of them.,btohqsg
Uob vs  uob ppv  hsbc revo  dbs wwmc.May need to uplift security before topping up,btohqsg
If cannot meet the min $1k spend for VS  then PPV still a better option right?,btohqsg
i see i see. so PPV is quite good for day to day transaction. i will look into it. thanks for the recommendation,btohqsg
Just want to confirm that‚Äôs the case even though it‚Äôs a recurring payment from SIMBA? üòÖ,btohqsg
Which cruise? If not interested in miles  youtrip/amaze wallet/trust are lowest in overall expense. CIMB Visa Signature has 10% for cruise but with $800 min spend and it's just not an attractive card standalone. UOB Evol  OCBC Frank  DBS Livefresh can give positive cashback but you must see if worth it or not.,btohqsg
Note PPV will rounddown each transaction to nearest $5 block before calculating miles  normal $10-20 payments still acceptable but lower than 4mpd,btohqsg
ooof i guess i have a lot of studying to do,btohqsg
based on datapoints of wwmc it is online not so sure about crmc cos some transactions that are online may end up not being online on citi rewards card,btohqsg
This is misleading  if you scroll down a bit  you realise that OP wrongly used the heymax estimated value for this calculation instead of the value actually charged to the choco card,btohqsg
Hi all. I heard that there will be bonus point having uob ladies savings pair with uob ladys card. If men cant open uob ladies savings  can we get our wife to open it and benefit from it?,btohqsg
You need to deposit min $10k inside Lady's savings account to be eligible for bonus 2mpd on Lady's credit card  you lose at least 3% interest in UOB One to buy the extra 2mpd,btohqsg
Yes. Usually need to spend above 900$ to make it worth.,btohqsg
Hi guys  do yall know if I‚Äôm still in time to depo to my OC360 to make it for the last day till 9.30pm later?,btohqsg
Hi all  just want to confirm for UOB PPV if contactless at UOB$ merchant  now earn UNI$ right?,btohqsg
"Men can apply it too. Men now can own the lady's card and the lady's savings account. It's funny but yeah. In the past they have a slogan ""but men don't get it"". Well looks like we got it now",btohqsg
Has anyone used chocolate visa debit card for AXS? I chose debit card but it doesn‚Äôt recognise card number. Then I chose credit card and the payment was declined and it‚Äôs not related to amount of money in account.,btohqsg
Did you use axs app or the physical machine? Did you freeze your choco card? Unfreeze card  use app  choose ‚Äúcredit card‚Äù option on app. Ensure your choco account got enough money since it‚Äôs a debit card afterall.,btohqsg
