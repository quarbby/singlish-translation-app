Y will have extra orders? Does it mean llm hide orders from those without bag🧐😂,btohqsg
Or because have bag so can take more stuff so they let those with bag stack 3 n above jobs😂,btohqsg

But some using their own ones >48L,btohqsg
With LLbag or not....bid still fail 🤣,btohqsg

Hi  I'm new join in as so called walker. I got some enquiry  can someone assist me,btohqsg
Basically I think walker can see bike job only,btohqsg
That's the problem  they asked me to prepare for vehicle  I don't even have a class 3 license. If anyone know how to work as a Walker do teach me please  thank you all.,btohqsg
you have bicycle or ebike? or really really just walking?,btohqsg
can use the in-app filter screen for the nearer short distance jobs.,btohqsg
In app filter not very accurate,btohqsg
but will make a lot more on a bicycle account on panda or grab. llm jobs mostly quite far.,btohqsg
Better to use Google map check,btohqsg
Ever saw an auntie riding those Brompton bicycle behind using the same lalabag for motorbike. Crusing along simpang bedok...during the evening....,btohqsg
Maybe go buy groceries using lalabaggie 😜,btohqsg
Whatever it is...u need to have at least motorbike. Becoz every month every lala agents regardless of what vehicular will need to take a photo of the branding which is bag or stickers for cars and above,btohqsg
Anyway  thanks. I will try and see what happens next. Thanks bro🙏🙏🙏,btohqsg
Just saw a motorbike job but need trolley because it's a washing machine. And someone actually bid the job  omg😅,btohqsg
If only we can ban those type of consumers,btohqsg
Hi Rachel  thanks for the info. Where is Tbh ? If I start I really don't mind the job loads  I just try out to gain experience. Your sharing means to me. By the way  I have not submit my deposit  and do you know any of the coverage areas at Woodlands? Good day😇😇😇,btohqsg
Actually there can be jobs short distance suitable for walkers  but u have to check if there's alot of stuff to deliver. If so  may be difficult for you to deliver also.,btohqsg
Some even call grab if the fare is low enough n the job price is good enough. Can stack😂,btohqsg
Wah like that how much per job siA,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong got no jobs labelled as walker,btohqsg
That's y u see some bike jobs will write no walkers pls,btohqsg
Actually i feel might be better register with grab panda etc as walker or bike,btohqsg
Then can on llm app see can stack extra or not lor,btohqsg
I'm mostly in town  sometimes can see jobs in town suitable for walkers,btohqsg
Not alot of pple want to take,btohqsg
Whereas is walker  take already can walk to the drop off,btohqsg
I ever considered parking somewhere then just take the jobs. Slowly walk since got 1 hr,btohqsg
Often see a multi stop job,btohqsg
Paragon or taka deliver to mbs then back,btohqsg
