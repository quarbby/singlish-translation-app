MyInfo is based on SingPass  which will take the latest earned income declared to IRAS. E.g. if he applied today  they will take his income in 2022.,btohqsg
i tried applying a few back also got rejected  so i think its not uncommon,btohqsg
If ur friend is an existing uob cc user  then i think income is not one of the field requested from myinfo and uob will use his old income info from when he last applied his credit card. Ask uob for the link to update income info and then apply again,btohqsg
Did u tell her that u participate b4?,btohqsg
it is a robot sending u,btohqsg
Does it usually take more then a week for uob card to be delivered?The approval process only took 1 working day but the card still not delivered after 1 week.Would like to know if that‚Äôs the norm,btohqsg
Hmm mine took about 3 days to withdraw and arrive in my account t,btohqsg
Quite risky in my opinion as:1. Subscription fee (3%) and management fee (1% p.a.) are pretty high.2. It was only launched on 16 Nov 2023  so no real track record to reference.3. The up to 6% monthly distribution may be made out of income  capital gains and/or capital. So to be clear  6% distribution doesn't mean 6% returns  as it could be selling the capital to be able to pay the 6% (similar to what happened tohttps://www.income.com.sg/funds/asian-income-fund)Additionally  based on what they're saying as which assets go into their portfolio  I don't see how they can offer 6% real growth  even simply just looking at the backtest:* Singapore REITS as an overall market has been flat over the past 10 years* STI has been flat over the past 10 years* Rest of Asia has been about 8% but it can only make up max 20% of their portfolio,btohqsg
"Yeh I did. She just sent me the tnc link and said ""sir you can check the TNC  you can enjoy this event~"". A bit skeptical.",btohqsg
