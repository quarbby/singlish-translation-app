Hi  anybody knows if planning to get a hdb loan still can book a flat if dont have HLE letter yet?,btohqsg
but if I recalled  I also never have my HLE done upon attending the signing of LOA (2nd appt)  it was done on spot by the HDB officer  if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
hi  does anyone here knows about Punggol Waterway Sunrise 2? It seems like the workers inside are not working. Whereas Punggol Waterway Sunrise 1 is working round the clock :(,btohqsg
Normally they will ask you to get a HLE done first as it is a pre evaluation kind of thing how much HDB can loan. So at least when you choose your flat or unit then you won’t over short on the finance.,btohqsg
Hi Does anyone have an idea for SBF 2020 ? Like any news so far ?,btohqsg

Anyone knows Bidadari 2020 Nov estimated completion date?,btohqsg
Don’t know is the people knowledge declined or technology cause work becoming slow... and also the final work so many issue/ problem.  I still remember my father’s time only 2-3 years and with very strong foundation,btohqsg
I'm supposed to get my BTO 2017 keys this Q4,btohqsg
dragged another 6 months at least,btohqsg
This is how unprofessional  unproductive  inefficiency nowadays,btohqsg
thought normally 4 years was what it takes to build,btohqsg
Not as it stated... when you went down.. date is 6 years,btohqsg
the current house I'm staying  was 2003 BTO and it was TOP 4 years later,btohqsg

Is it cos the block lesser?,btohqsg
5 years??? That’s very Long. How many blocks are yours?,btohqsg
Mine 6 block 38 storeys @ 6 years,btohqsg
So the TOP date is actually not accurate,btohqsg
Mine 2015 may bto 2 blocks with 16 storeys extended to q2 2021 too,btohqsg
Don't know will delay till when,btohqsg
