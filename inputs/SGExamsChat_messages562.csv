I FELT LIKE HAVING A PANIC ATTACK HALF WAY,btohqsg
most people found it super free,btohqsg
..okay gg  bell curve can't even save me now,btohqsg
I was doing the paper he said 15 mins left and I flipped around realising I had 4 questions left,btohqsg
worst part is last 4 questions is free marks,btohqsg
Someone do me a favour and get me a freediving suit. I am gonna go drown 20 meters underwater like Adam Mitchell when I lose the ability to float.,btohqsg

Then there was this one ass slamming his car horn for 3 minutes straight 🫠🫠🫠🫠,btohqsg
A LOT OF PPL HAVENT FINISH HALF OF THE PAPER,btohqsg
Is ur B for the completing square 24?,btohqsg
I wish I started from the back of the paper,btohqsg
They didnt even have the graph,btohqsg
if ur B is 24 then ur symmetry wont be 7,btohqsg
Idk how I got 24 and 7 for my symmetry,btohqsg
I don't even know what you guys are talking about,btohqsg
Cause my brain has shut down,btohqsg
i think bellcurve gonna save is,btohqsg
I think it’s part of the qn where u sketch the graph,btohqsg
reddit thinks everything is hard LOL,btohqsg
At least got bellcurve sVing us,btohqsg
I got x = -7 and 3..,btohqsg
So how is the line of symmetry 7,btohqsg
btw whats the diff between 4048 and 4052 ah,btohqsg
I think I f'd up then 🫠,btohqsg
I think I was so rushed I didn't do the other Pythagoras cause I think I only did two,btohqsg
did you finish your paper..i rmb leaving the last question blank for my o levels,btohqsg
I remember it was 0.6 smth,btohqsg
Might not be accurate cuz i used all whole numbers,btohqsg
I went into the syllabus seems like the only change is 4052 has more time,btohqsg
need to check whether i was correct 🤔🤔,btohqsg
Wtf why yall stressing out so much over emath,btohqsg
Because it's needed for alot of courses,btohqsg
I left half my h2 math paper blank,btohqsg
I did 2 stats qns and slept for the rest of paper 2,btohqsg
I only rmbr abt the people throwing dice over and over again,btohqsg
I spent 15min thinking to myself damn that was such a boring game,btohqsg
Then I skipped it and went to sleep,btohqsg
I only remember I fked up more in a levels and prelims,btohqsg
1. Is he a sportsmen. If yes he is probably pes c,btohqsg
Ngl reading the sgexams thread is funny if u didn't take the paper u just see people breaking down regardless of how easy te paper is,btohqsg
I rmbr last yr people complaining abt the error in the chem paper and nyjc getting 15min extra time or smth,btohqsg
bellcurve gonna be 55m for A1,btohqsg
DW we all gonna die tgt,btohqsg
U are probably better than 50% of sg population,btohqsg
No matter how many blanks you leave,btohqsg
Everyone else will probably be blank,btohqsg
Anyways I think out year h2 chem killed people so wtvs,btohqsg
Speaking of chem isn't it pure chem tmr?,btohqsg
My classmate didn't do the entire either or qn,btohqsg
Btw ur sch notes got some error,btohqsg
And I feel the 2.1 rigor is not very gd,btohqsg
It's more of its not rigorous enough,btohqsg
They expec us to do our own research on top of that,btohqsg
Cuz the standard is like not thr as compared to other schs,btohqsg
at least the school dont use kahoot as a graded quiz,btohqsg
Anyways 4052 syllabus they alr said will have abt 26 qns,btohqsg
So 27 shud be the norm,btohqsg
must give in 2dp or 4dp,btohqsg
cuz in the qn it was 4dp,btohqsg
I put 5sf cuz question also give the rate as 5sf,btohqsg
so which one is correct 😭,btohqsg
Bro i put 3 sf one,btohqsg
I put 2 sf since its money,btohqsg
Exchange rate of sgd to euro,btohqsg
i put same dp as q wbu,btohqsg
think is 5sf w 4dp so i put 0.6xxx,btohqsg
Ya I think last part got one 8 but no ideas,btohqsg
don't think abt the paper alr,btohqsg
To see how many marks I need for p2,btohqsg
Anyone have p1 e math pdf,btohqsg
Go misstmaths gc in tele got the pdf,btohqsg

But ya is all the small small stuff like this,btohqsg
"I wrote ""regardless of"" instead of ""if"" didn't change the meaning of the sentence but wrong",btohqsg
Got given 0 for language for gp essay,btohqsg
Bad? Not cuz people don't do well but cuz the marking is damn funny,btohqsg

calcium hydroxide (limewater)   calcium carbonate (limestone),btohqsg
pls pull down the bell curve yall,btohqsg
i lazy type the entire thing out LOL LOL,btohqsg
To be fair  one can be lazy and knowledgeable at the same time. I don't like that exams supposedly test knowledge but in reality it's about the ability to memorise random trivia.Like  what's the composition of nitrogen in air? If you asked me I'd say 70 something%. It's the 2020s  we can look it up. (Yeah  ik  it's N2 79% and O2 21%. I'll forget that after the exams end tyvm).Anyway I just have strong feelings about how this exam is such a big deal in our society but it's so flawed in design.,btohqsg
Both lazy and hardworking are relative.I have seen students who said they were very hardworking and studied very hard  but still failed their exams.When probed deeper  their hardworking referred to only starting to study just 2 days before a major EOY exams  after not doing anything for the entire year. Hardworking because entire 2 days was devoted to studying (out of the whole year).,btohqsg
Btw  this is not impossible at the O level. My O level time  I had a friend who gave up on Geography during the O level revision  though he studied throughout the year.He only started studying for Georg the evening before the paper and he came out A1.However  this is going to be near impossible for Maths and Science subjects.,btohqsg
I'd argue some people just aren't cut out for academics as we have it today. I don't understand why facts are more important to academia than teaching and learning concepts and discovering new things.I'm doing the exams because I want the certificate  but I feel like I've barely learnt anything other than how to answer exam questions the entire year.It feels hard to find the point in doing that when you're supposedly meant to be learning. I can relate to those who gave up on the exams  especially since I dropped out once.Of course I've worked hard this year  but that's because I want to get it over and done with already.,btohqsg
Ok but tbh geog if udk how to phrase the ans also no matter how much cramming u do also gg,btohqsg
It almost feels like we put undue emphasis on exams because we need to prove our country's educational superiority on the world stage  lolAnyway  sorry for the rant  but I have to disagree that exams prove or disprove a person's ability to learn.,btohqsg
My geog stopped at S2  so I can't tell also,btohqsg
Yeah. I know that personally. I've been interested in programming since forever and taught myself so much. But I probably won't ever get a job as a programmer in Singapore because I'm dumb on paper.,btohqsg
yea i only realised I had to really really study to do well from A levels personally,btohqsg
last min in uni kinda worked tho somehow,btohqsg
Lazy how to get A1  but lazy means cannot learn meh,btohqsg
like education showing your ability to learn is a uni thing,btohqsg
bc that's what a lot of companies look at with your degree,btohqsg
but before uni it's all about just getting the credentials to get admission,btohqsg
No diploma no degree submit job application also auto reject lol,btohqsg
yea you'd want some sort of diploma/degree to just get past arbitrary filters but programming is one of the pathways that don't require you to actually have super related majors,btohqsg
and at the end of the day  that arbitrary filter is needed bc the number of people that can fill the role you're looking for is very high,btohqsg
Sian not like the economy is doing great so might as well tahan,btohqsg
like unless your portfolio is so impressive  more than likely many people can do it at the same level as you and have a degree,btohqsg
"I F9 ed my Chem and Physics from Sec 1-5...prelims had a 32/100 and a 35 or 37/100Last 3 weeks before combined science o levels  i put in the ""Hardwork"" and scored a C6 for both for o levels.I know i can do better myself..but at the same time i constantly question that need. Whether its because i've been influenced by peers that did minimal and achieve better results or whether its peers that did alot but achieved less than ideal results...I cant balance..",btohqsg
That is actually a statement with truth..our ministers have conveyed the exact same idea before,btohqsg
the sentiments about exams and stuff has been there forever  but no one has a better solution,btohqsg
all they've done is try to reshape exams to be seen less that way  but let's be real it's the same shit,btohqsg
I think I'll do better in working world tbh,btohqsg
issue is just if i'm in charge of hiring someone  how can they prove that they'll do well,btohqsg
people are not as special when it comes to the workplace as they're led to thinking  just because they can thrive,btohqsg
I actually do projects with a couple of friends already and enjoy that a lot more than anything I've ever done in schoolAt least I have freedom and flexibility to choose how I do things y'know,btohqsg
"In school it's like ""narh  take these notes  this is everything you need to memorise by hook or crook before the end of the year""",btohqsg
yea i get that  but i'm just talking in terms of the industry world that don't know you personally at all,btohqsg
like if got 100s of people applying for one position  there's almost always going to be someone that has the similar qualities as you and has a degree/diploma,btohqsg
with the caveat being unless your portfolio/resume is super impressive,btohqsg
but those are far in the minority  and so it still makes sense to filter those without the cert out first,btohqsg
"MeritocracyBest summarised by my father:""Singapore does not just want people  they want people with EQ and IQ.""",btohqsg
at least it's not entry level job but requires years of work experience,btohqsg
@Ryannnnnnnnnnmy data in sch so shit,btohqsg
The hard truth is that internationally  most good companies still hire by results for fresh grads.Most of the times  there are no better ways at all to judge a person fresh out of school apart from results.,btohqsg
try going to a company with C6 results and tell them they should hire you because your projects are all very well done.vs the other guys who project work in sch are normal but scored all As.,btohqsg
academic envir can be different sometimes  based on how the structure is  some people can do good projects win in hackathons but arent that good at memorising things and outputting word for word  it doesnt mean that someone is having bad results rn means they are shit forever,btohqsg
replied to wrg msg but ye ^^,btohqsg
the way i put it is,btohqsg
if you don't have academic results  you better have something else in your portfolio to back it up,btohqsg
unfortunately the education system in sg is like that,btohqsg
theres a fine line ig  you shouldnt be expecting companies to believe youre good just because youre good at projects  but when it comes to projects  if youve done it and youve done it well  companies can see it sometimes. and considering they said C6? i suppose its jc / sec sch current moment  and i think that if they move on to the next education stepping stone (uni) it will be different  my JC was shit  im doing well in uni  with straight As. does this mean im dumb? no  i just wasnt doing well in the field that i was put into  to ace eng  maths  science  chinese etc,btohqsg
what u doin in uni now,btohqsg
uh my A level results was ACDE/B,btohqsg
i tell everyone i collected every grade possible that isn't failing,btohqsg
who else can even achieve that,btohqsg
i didn't thrive in jc environment so i fully get the idea of exams and stuff being shit but,btohqsg
realistically i didn't expect uni to accept me,btohqsg
and like when it comes to projects and shit  the issue is that that avenue is more open to certain paths than others,btohqsg
cs is always the prime example where you can maybe do that,btohqsg
Combined chem was easy peazy lemon squeezy,btohqsg
"i was considerably ""shit at academics"" and i thought ok im dumb  went into this field n realise that the education system that says youre shit expects you to be good at everything  while real world wants you to be good at 1 field",btohqsg
i didn't think i was dumb. i was just unmotivated as fuck,btohqsg
fk u i eat grass bruh,btohqsg
i'd rather pay than take ration,btohqsg
can anyone send chem pdf for combined,btohqsg
dear scambridge pls do not make grade boundary 60/65,btohqsg
just had something similar from Let’s EatCurry chicken rice,btohqsg
I have only 1 internship experience when I graduated.It was due to the scholarship I got in year 2 uni.Having academics makes it an easier path  especially when don't graduate with a uni debt.,btohqsg
the difference your grades was sufficient to put you into uni. It was a successful stepping stone to next step regardless of score.But what if the grades was insufficient for uni? That becomes another story.Not saying it's not possible to do well after that. There are plenty of examples from my NS of ITE grads doing very very well  much better than most uni grads.,btohqsg
ultimately it's about putting in the work. Be it in school or out of school.,btohqsg
Idk if it’s because I’m immature  sheltered or just got handed a stroke of word luck for a life…My whole family tree  I have 12+ cousins…all are from millionaire families.I’ve seen and been to these cousin’s parents workplaces and I could you not…I still can’t figure out why they are where they are  some of them told me because they were given a “once in a lifetime” opportunity….some told me there went overseas and came back with experience but there were a handful that never had a diploma  or even one that did not even finish sec school,btohqsg
for employers of fresh grad  it's like  if there's no evidence of you having put in the hard work in school  how to know if you will put in the hard work at work?There's no basis to judge,btohqsg
There was even one that said that my family could have been a millionaire had my father accepted a offer that was given to him…,btohqsg
with inflation  a million is just a hdb away,btohqsg
I’m not talking about hdb’s…almost all my cousins live in landed properties,btohqsg
In my family tree  my family’s property is the least valuable,btohqsg
there was a period of time just 20 odd years ago where 200k+ is sufficient for downpayment of a landed,btohqsg
but many including my parents didn't make the move 😭,btohqsg
Yep I know but I know they are definitely millionaires…the things they have says enough,btohqsg
what's the purpose for saying this,btohqsg
ready to go to ite central liao,btohqsg
Cause I’m conflicted whether hard work will bring me anywhere…cause all I’ve been seeing my whole life is slackers earning millions,btohqsg
im so mad i got that almlst right,btohqsg
it's because you don't see the hard work behind,btohqsg
I know of 2 self made multi millionaires. They are quite slack and enjoying life now.But I know they worked real hard in their younger days,btohqsg
one of them retired at age 35.,btohqsg
not the literal blood sweat and tears,btohqsg
it's really about putting in the work,btohqsg
blood sweat and tears by bts,btohqsg
some get lucky and reach the goal faster,btohqsg
if academic route cannot  im gonna audit to be an idol in sk,btohqsg
Can slack and earn? Can. Born into rich family,btohqsg
can earn money and brand deals,btohqsg
as long as high salary can alr,btohqsg
no more maths and chem anymore ehhh,btohqsg
I feel like the only way to earn millions is either to deceive  cheat or scam people,btohqsg
You can never be a honest person if you want to be a millionaire,btohqsg
wait when ur passion is unable to sustain urself then u question,btohqsg
so ur relatives are all scammers,btohqsg
Nope I’m just saying  I mean theoretically advertisements are scamming…They advertise a product but the product in question does not appear the same way,btohqsg
don’t everyone has had that phrase,btohqsg
Is that not some form of scamming?,btohqsg
i think my friend went to apply for the nyc flim sch,btohqsg
im planming to audit ar hybe or sm,btohqsg
do you honestly think it’s also that easy,btohqsg
I could care less honestly…not like you can scam someone into buying a miracle pill,btohqsg
A million isn't a lot nowadays. You don't see it yet because you are still young,btohqsg
i think i need to find a billionaire or millionaire man to marry next time,btohqsg
That’s why I’m thinking if I’m sheltered,btohqsg
nth is easy in life if u don't work for it:),btohqsg
I worked 70h a week that time,btohqsg
Whatever the definition  I just think it’s someone with millions,btohqsg
a millionaire quite literally means having assets worth up to a million,btohqsg
student loans really dragged me down a lot,btohqsg
im literally just stating what I’ve seen in my life,btohqsg
There is no argument  I just want some thoughts on it. That is literally it,btohqsg
someone who is worth a million or more based on assets+money,btohqsg
I’m not purposely being dumb or retarded…I feel like I’ve just been too sheltered,btohqsg
is been almost 20years  my parents still haven't finish paying off our hse,btohqsg
imagine my loan is 1.5%but fixed d at 3%,btohqsg
but kpop idol might be to far if udh talent,btohqsg
the long hours and also ur mental health,btohqsg

a lot of these look nice on the surface,btohqsg
keep thinking that way i guess,btohqsg
My thinking have made me money lmao,btohqsg
I want to die for this sem,btohqsg
I see it differently. I see it as you need to work hard to learn how to manage the family assets in the future,btohqsg
It not a lot but it’s a start…don’t you all say that,btohqsg
bro manages to be dumber than woke leftists  at least their claim is Billionaires have to be unethical which is slightly more plausible than this idiot talking about multimillionaires,btohqsg
an insider from an ent told me pretty face can solve all this,btohqsg
but i mean u can try,btohqsg
nepo can solve if i not wrong in kpop,btohqsg
I give up I’m doing physics instead,btohqsg
I mean like generation of us,btohqsg
