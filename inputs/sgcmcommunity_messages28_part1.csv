Polestar 3 and new XC90 will look like Lynk&Co 09,btohqsg
"Polestar 2 was initially supposed to be on Volvo's 40.2 platform and it was actually really ugly imo. But when Polestar seperated from Volvo and became a brand that makes ""sportier EV"" i think they tweaked the car really well to make it good looking.",btohqsg
40.2 is for Polestar 240.1 is for XC40,btohqsg
Copied from Jefferson Tan in EV Enthusiast groupFun fact: Do you know PS2 and XC40 were first revealed to the public as Volvo Concept 40.2 and 40.1 respectively?PS2’s design was originally meant to be the sedan version of the XC40  until Volvo decided to set up its performance arm (Polestar) as a standalone brand. PS2 design is then exclusively used by Polestar. The standalone Polestar brand will focus on making performance electric vehicles  pushing the frontiers in design  driving dynamics and sustainability which may not be best suited for the traditional Volvo brand (yet). Some of these will trickle to Volvo eventually after testing market’s acceptance.Polestar will share a lot of similarity with Volvo (they are assembled in the same plant)  but it will increasingly have its own unique differentiation from Volvo with time  without losing the key roots of being an offshoot from the Volvo brand. Its about experiencing the Swedish brand in a different way.,btohqsg
i like this and color too,btohqsg
