To be honest I read something about mental illnesses and Uni/Masters and PhD programs in a study once  I think the best thing you can do for yourself at uni is to make sure you have a good social circle.,btohqsg
Even if you’re not the smartest a good group can keep you going to completion,btohqsg
Plus the fact that there are other humans around you makes you just a bit more accountable to them for your own well-being  it can be very tough in many courses,btohqsg
this is kinda funny timing since i’m giving a presentation soon on mental health in academia for one of my PhD seminar courses,btohqsg
tbh its more of it being my first sem so i hadn’t fully adapted i feel,btohqsg
but yes i agree. a good circle of friends keeps me going even though i’m stressed out of my mind all the time nowadays,btohqsg
I went through quite the metamorphosis  mentally and physically speaking during university and not for the better lol.Nowadays I’m a lot more open minded and able to control my emotions better  which some people seem to think makes me more professional.Guess it’s not all bad  but damn university really does accelerate your brain development after 2 years of regression while wearing the helmet.,btohqsg
You know the thing they say about soldiers who have seen combat right? They’re never the same again  wow I feel in some ways the stress level and what happened are comparable to that lol.,btohqsg
uni changed me a lot for the better and got me to where i am now  although i can feel myself regressing mental health wise slowly ever since i started the PhD,btohqsg
like i’ve truthfully nvr been very stressed during undergrad,btohqsg
and it felt laughable compared to how i’m feeling now,btohqsg
I think for you perhaps you’re very academically inclined and you’ve only just met the frontier of how far you can push yourself,btohqsg
But for me my academic performance was fueled by tuition,btohqsg
Once that was gone it’s like withdrawal symptoms,btohqsg
idk about academically inclined because i kinda lucked my way into uni,btohqsg
i told this to the chat before but i really didn’t study for A levels or do anything for it outside of PW,btohqsg
it was only in uni that i found my groove sorta,btohqsg
so i nvr really had anything to get withdrawal symptoms for,btohqsg
Well I think the admittance to university is a fairly high bar in the first place so you don’t feel academically strong but innately  if we objectively chart your performance relative to the population  you are (or were).,btohqsg
was never academically inclined  no tuition helped me to ace cuz i just had no passion hahaha its only now that im in CS in uni that im doing alot better,btohqsg
Whereas for me  my university degree is attributable to tuition quite clearly lol,btohqsg
perhaps that’s a way to look at it,btohqsg
Would not be a degreeholder if tuition didn’t drag me across the minimal grade line to qualify,btohqsg
then theres me who went into a uni simply bc my sch allowed me to mix my o levels,btohqsg
i guess some people just adapt to or even prefer to the uni system better esp when you’re honed into your course,btohqsg
Guys this is a yearly intake for poly students,btohqsg
Hey everyone has to take some road to their future  so just make the best of it,btohqsg
This is the yearly intake for JC students,btohqsg
for me by the time i got to JC i was just spent and didn’t care about A levels,btohqsg
so i just followed through the motion,btohqsg
i mean im not complaining with my results hahaha,btohqsg
This is the amount of o levels candidates a year,btohqsg
lol i didn’t even have a bad reaction when seeing my results,btohqsg
n then theres me who couldnt process bc of specific reasons,btohqsg
there are ways to enter poly outside of O levels,btohqsg
look at the amt of fails,btohqsg
doing the maths  its over 10 000 students from other streams,btohqsg
considering that like schs like ri and hwach each have around 1000+ students per cohort,btohqsg
i still dont understand why ppl rather poly than jc tho,btohqsg
to the point where they’re so disgusted by jc,btohqsg
there’s good and bad reasons to want poly,btohqsg
like wldnt u be kinda proud u got in to a jc,btohqsg
i find the tiktok for u,btohqsg
idk...its the governmnet way of counting females,btohqsg
You get a 1 year discount if you are intending to go to Uni and then work is a big one,btohqsg
but then proceeds to shit on yi ori,btohqsg
Are all of those for Singaporean only cohort or Sg/PR and not counting non sg in attendance?,btohqsg
its like when u alr go in with such a negstive mindset u end up seeing everything like shit,btohqsg
if yall dont study then gg lor,btohqsg
i feel like its true but at the same time,btohqsg
