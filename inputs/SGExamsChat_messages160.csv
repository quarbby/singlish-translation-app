hence  chemistry is the superior science,btohqsg
Because you just joined  and personal questions can make others uncomfortable. Got it?,btohqsg
i realised most or maybe all the science courses in poly have bio,btohqsg
Eh anybody here have English exam papers (O levels),btohqsg
I ask but 200+ msgs later no one reply üòÇ,btohqsg
Check outhttps://t.me/SGExamsPortal  there's a pinned message,btohqsg
Again  you guys need to stop saying hi excessively,btohqsg
I told you  it adds no value to the conversation,btohqsg
What kind of physics is this,btohqsg
Speed is a scalar and therefore it makes no sense to say whether it is vertical or not,btohqsg
I can use this without being spammy,btohqsg
Idu how you guys wake up so early,btohqsg
I deleted ig and i still slept at 2,btohqsg
i now have a fixed sleeping schedule i sleep beyond 1am at night,btohqsg
I used to sleep at 4am daily,btohqsg
Should i just go for o levels then see if go ite,btohqsg
Honestly ITE is mostly hands on work,btohqsg
If you like that instead of studying then go higher nitec,btohqsg
I feel i not capable to go poly,btohqsg
So maybe go ite then poly,btohqsg
If you go nitec and have a perfect GPA the first year  you will be able to apply for poly,btohqsg
Higher nitec first year then can go poly?,btohqsg
U ask since jan until now,btohqsg
Other than that not that good,btohqsg
then how r ur others like...?,btohqsg
whats ur l1r4 if udm me asking,btohqsg
Regret not going eae right now,btohqsg
But doesnt that mean olevels will be easier for u,btohqsg
But the course i want cutoff 11,btohqsg
So i regret not trying for eae,btohqsg
They give easy to kinda encourage us,btohqsg
U know even though i feel easy,btohqsg
My class alot people failing the exam alr,btohqsg
If harder abit probably all f9s liao,btohqsg
Ye that means ur good la haha,btohqsg
Hmm they say i topped physic,btohqsg
Lowkey laughing when i saw the higher nitec,btohqsg
Why he got ite? I thought can go any course,btohqsg
My sch got 45 students who got their eae offers,btohqsg
Higher nitec equal to 4 o level pass,btohqsg
Like the distance is quite far,btohqsg
If i can maybe go also,btohqsg
Cause higher nitec still can skip poly one year,btohqsg
idt most of tps courses are above 16,btohqsg
tbh jus try ur best not to go ite at all guys,btohqsg
or at least dont make it ur goal,btohqsg
tourism 17 if im nt wrong,btohqsg
Humanities course are 8 to 11 points,btohqsg
nvm dont need to think abt the paper that hv past now think abt ur other papers,btohqsg
For bio prac whats ur highest glucose conc.,btohqsg
considering highest in cohort is 69,btohqsg
Idt i can even pass my el in jc,btohqsg
usually one JC cohort will have at least 10 ppl retain i think,btohqsg
my sec sch got 1-2 retain,btohqsg
there was once a girl who retain for 2 year in sec 3,btohqsg
I go jc want to learn math chem and phys,btohqsg
so now she is sec 4,btohqsg
That is why i went to poly,btohqsg
ull be forced to take Pw and GP and another humantiies subject,btohqsg
I just got to hit less than 12 for l1r4,btohqsg
So when my relative ask me i still got face,btohqsg
is ur sch eng pprs tough,btohqsg
i have a friend who got C6 for O level English,btohqsg
he still went to JC  and apparnetly he getting top few in sch,btohqsg
tbh my sch el pprs tough,btohqsg
i also have friends who come from PSLE 240++ school who got like UUSS for promos,btohqsg
a + b + c + d = 1m ü§°ü§°ü§°,btohqsg
I found every el paper tough,btohqsg
Sometimes my marks can score damn high,btohqsg
i mean if u can get a + b + c + d ur 1m secured la but,btohqsg
My friend want to take PHMe,btohqsg
no point taking H2 econs at leaast for me,btohqsg
some sch have criteria for u to take 4 H2 also,btohqsg
JC geog is as bad as JC bio haha,btohqsg
bio and geog is kinda the same thing isnt it,btohqsg
not about elite  they dw u to struggle with 4 H2 subject,btohqsg
cos at the end of the day one of ur H2 gonna be calculated as H1,btohqsg
so might as well take h1 to begin rather than drop at JC2,btohqsg
no key word 1m chop off,btohqsg
So minimumlly is 3 h2 and 1 h1?,btohqsg
drawing 1 part wrong marks chopoff oso,btohqsg
and tbh idk whats the point of 4H2  but some people say maybe u have some hidden poetntial in the Art subject and can do it better than ur 3 sciences or vice versa,btohqsg
3H2 1H1 u pick+ H1 GP + H1 PW + H1 Mother Tongue,btohqsg
I heard jpjc PW quite good sia,btohqsg
Or maybe that particular year the batch very good,btohqsg
not sure  but i know Anderson distinciton rate damn low cos my friend who did alot of work and presetned quite well got B,btohqsg
i assume they are cux 75% of my frsnd class got A,btohqsg
but apart from that  nothing much  unless u include H1 Econs,btohqsg
just pw and h1 econs only,btohqsg
I am never withdrawing my eae,btohqsg
I gg becoming a pilot not to mug,btohqsg
I see all the jc student like panda HAHAHA,btohqsg
I sleep at 1+ everyday LOL,btohqsg
Wake up no energy but aft awhile got energy,btohqsg
If i go jc i think my eyelid is like 100N,btohqsg
I sleep after 4 nearly everyday...,btohqsg
Wah HAHA my december holiday sleep routine,btohqsg
I cant even be secure abt passing english now,btohqsg
Drink coffee! The drink of choice for mathematicians,btohqsg
GP isn't hard. Although some JCs might not want to give A for internal exams,btohqsg
Thr is one teacher in my sch got 2 PhD,btohqsg
I wonder if she ever got phd,btohqsg
But with moderation and all that  if you have a high percentile very likely you are going to get A in A levels anyways,btohqsg
If im failing english at os do you think ill pass gp....,btohqsg
Hahaha  hello  I was too busy with uni assignments,btohqsg
i failing also in sec sch  but i flunk my O level and fluke my Prelims GP,btohqsg
I just want b4 for my el,btohqsg
L1r4 11 so near yet so far,btohqsg
u know i never even gotten an A before for english in sec sch,btohqsg
ive never gotten an A before from Pri sch to JC2,btohqsg
my sec sch is always C5 and C6,btohqsg
I got a few As in english,btohqsg
If i get way higher than 11 we wont see each other :),btohqsg
but my O level Got B3 üòãüòã,btohqsg
den when i go JC i fail my GP ahain,btohqsg
got chance get A for GP,btohqsg
i read a Book my friend gave me  for P6 english,btohqsg
I see people who get B3 in O level english get E  S and U in GP. But that is JC1  so there is still time to get used to GP,btohqsg
help me went from C5/C6 to B3 in O level,btohqsg
Idk i kinda want to go back to primary sch to attend el class,btohqsg
and after O level i stop using it,btohqsg
and now my GP is S E D grade,btohqsg
now i struggle to get a B,btohqsg
inside the book got like nouns  verbs  adverbs  past participle etc,btohqsg
If your percentile is high  don't worry,btohqsg
i speak more english than chinese,btohqsg
but i didnt get A for chi os,btohqsg
not a flex IM FAILING NOW,btohqsg
Who cares about Psle when you work?,btohqsg
my friend got 4A  guess his PSLE score,btohqsg
my friend got 4A but PSLE is 215,btohqsg
‚ÄúSorry  you ain‚Äôt hired because score not high enough‚Äù,btohqsg
Cuz everyone gonna end up in the same sec sch,btohqsg
i rmb i got A* A B C,btohqsg
I can't even understand PSLE mathematics at this age. So don't worry.,btohqsg
yea  when i go JC my teacher say they dc about ur o level,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not like you grad from primary sch you can qualify to work,btohqsg
Their teaching in math was so rigid,btohqsg
I wished i could learn algebra in primart sch,btohqsg
O level is needed for UK and some US uni applications,btohqsg
If you do IP they will care about Sec 4 grades,btohqsg
ye my pri sch math alw cannot A*,btohqsg
come sec sch A1 wasnt a prob for a while,btohqsg
And they apparently don't see L1R5. Use percentage of A1,btohqsg
In primary sch my math always get A,btohqsg
i.e.  if 5A1s out of 10  50%,btohqsg
Yup they ask you to enter the grade only,btohqsg
But after going to sec 3,btohqsg
I have a friend for sec sch he was all rounder,btohqsg
He got like A B C D E,btohqsg
My science is C. english is B,btohqsg
Anyone got like 2A for psle and get below 200 ?,btohqsg
Your sciences end up the best,btohqsg
I have a friend who got B B B C,btohqsg
I think her score was like 180+,btohqsg
So she just went to Sec 4 NA,btohqsg
But she had tuition for like every subject before psle,btohqsg
Monday to Friday everyday got tuition one,btohqsg
I got 189... With like 2A* and 1D 1C but only can go na,btohqsg
Tuition does not imply success in general. The converse is not true either,btohqsg
So not true 188 can go express ahWell it‚Äôs Kel here,btohqsg
It depends on the English grade ah,btohqsg
I have a friend whose PSLE was 236 I think,btohqsg
But he went to an express school with cut off 190+,btohqsg
Tuition is like medicineIn moderation it helpsToo much... it kills,btohqsg

Hi anyone took bio pract tdy?,btohqsg
For glucose concentration whats the range yall got?,btohqsg
except for sample b that i somehow messed up and got 3.60,btohqsg
Shit rate of change killing me,btohqsg
How does question 6 even work man,btohqsg
bc the rate is the amt of water u pour in every sec,btohqsg
Rate of change is getting out of hand recently,btohqsg
I do the other question all still ok,btohqsg
Can anyone send 2019 A math paper 1 and 2 pdf,btohqsg
like for e.g. u wan 9cm of water in ur bowl,btohqsg
u need like for example 81pi,btohqsg
u will take 81pi/9pi = 9 seconds,btohqsg
itd the same concept for the one above,btohqsg
my jc used to have 60 ppl retaining a year,btohqsg
Questions from my younger brother :‚Ä¢Is it worth to start studying for As before going into JC?If yes is there any revisions guide that is useful for him to start reading? If no why not.‚Ä¢ Is internship better than volunteering in terms of boosting up his portfolio?,btohqsg
‚Ä¢ Nah just go in with an open mind. A general guide is that for subjects one attains A1/A2 for  he/she will prob get an A/B for that same subject for A levels  provided he/she is consistent in studies‚Ä¢ Depends on type of internship. Most uni courses dont rly need internships anyways  so volunteering is prob more important as it contributes to CIP hours.,btohqsg
Wah must hold your pee for 1h,btohqsg
Its always been part of the syllabus,btohqsg
I mean i see from tys,btohqsg
r yall talking abt rate of change,btohqsg
oh thats alw thr wym new lol,btohqsg
alw the same ?? abt the rate of change la,btohqsg
‚Ä¢ thanks for replying for the first part‚Ä¢ Well I have been offered for both dsta and DSO National Laboratories for intern but I don't know which is better and am not sure if those could be use as a volunteering activity for my nyaa. If it can't be use as an nyaa activity I would have to find extra time to do it.,btohqsg
sorry if my English is bad.,btohqsg
i guess if you are rly interested in research then of course take up the internship  is definitely an added bonus in your portfolio  especially if you wanna apply for scholarships in the future if you do well for A levels. But of course the internship helps your portfolio if is related to your course of study in uni (eg. science related course for research internships),btohqsg
I bought iPad mini earlier than the one that is released this year,btohqsg
Plus   my budget at that time was $1000,btohqsg
Not enough to buy iPad Air,btohqsg
And Since I like my tablet to be portable and like an A5 style,btohqsg
I love iPad mini with the feature of Apple Pencil,btohqsg
Oh I see. Because both of it actually offered me two things one for science one for computer science,btohqsg
Then you'll need to make your own decision.Do some research on both organisations and analyse the pros and cons of each.,btohqsg
I know but how with volume,btohqsg
if u send me qn i can help u understand,btohqsg
Im not sure if i got more fm topivs right or j2 h2 topics right,btohqsg
Cause they burn the paper after we check haha,btohqsg
They gave it back for 30 mins,btohqsg
Then they ask us count our marks then give back,btohqsg
So we cant really argue and say the teacher mark wrong,btohqsg
So weird. You could have learnt from the mistakes in the paper...,btohqsg
Unless they count wrong or its blatantly obvious,btohqsg
They only give it back for 30 mins some may not even spot it,btohqsg
Yeah they ask us bring calculator and pencil,btohqsg
Put our bags and phone at the side lmao,btohqsg
Do they do this for all the other subjects?,btohqsg
Rae of change is my favourite,btohqsg
You will soon love rate of change,btohqsg
I swear they say all jcs do it,btohqsg
Nonsense. I have all my papers back back in the day. Perhaps MOE gave a directive later on?,btohqsg
Oh yeah they also say they dont show rankings anymore cause moe say dont,btohqsg
I swear i saw hci got rankings,btohqsg
they only show the range in my school   eg 40-60th percentile,btohqsg
Some schools apparently use Q1 or something instead,btohqsg
Damn wished i could at least know,btohqsg
Well  if you had been born earlier  you would have...,btohqsg
Trust me  it's not a nice feeling if you know and it's not very good,btohqsg
Wouldnt it be better if it was by request basis,btohqsg
i mean  then i guess lor haha,btohqsg
personally i like to not know so i dont b so demoralised ü§°,btohqsg
But it defeats the purpose  because you will start comparing with others.And people might get teased for not requesting the percentile,btohqsg
I guess its more of a better alternative than a perfect solution,btohqsg
Seems like moe decided no percentoles or ranks is the best solurion,btohqsg
tbh i wld disagree w the second point tho  i guess it depends on your friend grp and how nice they are,btohqsg
Yeah  if your classmates and friends are nice  it's not an issue. But it may become an issue if they aren't. We can't assume we live in a perfect world with everyone around us being nice,btohqsg
When I was in JC  my physics teacher just displayed everyone's grades to the class. Plus percentile on the results slip.,btohqsg
My classmates are all nice people and I‚Äôve got same classes when two of my best friends,btohqsg
My teacher is very fun too,btohqsg
He let us leave school early,btohqsg
Very good to hear. But I can tell you many people aren't as lucky as you,btohqsg
ok ngl thats q fked up  my own environment no one gives a damn about how we do for results,btohqsg
I see. In sec sch how the teacher used to do it is ask if everyone is ok with it,btohqsg
In jc its as if theyre super secretive about marks,btohqsg
My mom abandoned me.I got bullied from my cousinSo I moved across country to live with my grandparents (dad‚Äôs parents),btohqsg
I think the policy was implemented in 2018? Or something. That's when I first heard about the MOE directive,btohqsg
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are okay now.,btohqsg
ik some schools that do that,btohqsg
i dont even like it if my friends see my results,btohqsg
sorry to hear this  im glad for u to have found good friends tho  hope you're doing well,btohqsg
My sec sch was super small so they didnt display percentiles even before then,btohqsg
Don't get me wrong  I don't hate my physics teacher for it. I'm thankful she gave me a lot of consultation sessions. My grades jumped from U to A,btohqsg
But they just displayed everyones marks if everyone consented even after 2018,btohqsg
shiookk that A must've feel good,btohqsg
Yes. I am. I Like living here than where my parents are from. Thank you,btohqsg
Yeah. But I mean  I'm different as in I'm very sensitive to how I am taught. So I need everything presented in a clear and very succint manner. If everything works out my way my grades will suddenly jump.,btohqsg
Does anyone have the mgs 2020 prelim Chem answer key if have can dm me,btohqsg
that's interesting to hear  at the very least  u know ur learning style well and everything paid off  so im glad for u fam:),btohqsg
hows yall dealing w covid the past months anyhow,btohqsg
the only correct answer is that you don't,btohqsg
I feel like an introduction qn in schs in the future will be,btohqsg
Did you do anything productive during covid,btohqsg
