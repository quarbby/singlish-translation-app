hello gurus. i saw the dbs altitude sign up promo. However  theres two option of DBS altitude amercian express and DBS altitude visa where the former can earn up to 60k miles and the latter 53k miles. both spending 3k. Which is a better choice because though the american express one can get higher miles  i heard AMEX is not widely accepted. PLease advice,btohqsg
Visa is a safer option. More worth than 7k miles signup difference.,btohqsg
7k miles is about 100 dollars? means till now AMEX is still widely not accepted? thank you =),btohqsg
Ya. In Singapore and around SEA/east Asia. Visa version has a use case for cardup later too.,btohqsg
understood. thanks for the advice =)  because im gonna sign up and purchase an ipad pro which alr cost 2k. so 1k remaining im thinking will it be a too high of a risk to take to yolo to go for AMEX HAHA,btohqsg
Gurus. I’m short of $50 for vantage signup bonus.Can I use Cardup to hit?,btohqsg
Most cardup trnx are excluded for signup bonus due to 7399,btohqsg
Grab some vouchers. Chris has vid bout itZ,btohqsg
Rental leh. 🥲Milelion said Rental can sia….,btohqsg
Idea 💡Good idea hor. Thanks Chris!,btohqsg
I just started using HSBC card online again (stopped for long time) and today was surprised on how HSBC does it. Yeah it is HSBC Live+.No more SMS OTP (yeah this is normal).But the merchant page actually pauses at the authentication screen and requires the card holder to LOGIN TO HSBC APP  not just open the app or have an app popup  but you need to LOGIN to the HSBC APP.After card holder logins to hsbc app  then you will see the popup asking you to authorise the payment.No phone popup  no app notification  UNLESS you login to the app.,btohqsg
Every time purchase have to login? Hows the card so far btw  thinking if i shld apply,btohqsg
Yeah abit weird compared to how the local banks does it,btohqsg
No cannot! Use ntuc voucher also can,btohqsg
I apologize for my dumb question but somehow quite urgent. What’s the best way to set up giro to pay personal tax from my UOB one account?,btohqsg
Are u asking if u wanna use with cardup?Cause setting up giro is pretty straight forward if u see the app,btohqsg
Urgent as in need immediate payment by today or...?Cause it looks like u are trying to setup GIRO  that which u would need to use the site,btohqsg
I actually prefer it this way. Use app to authenticate.Citibank also right?,btohqsg
GG liao… too late. I paid for my cardup liao… I think need to call DBS to ask soon…. 🥲🥲🥲,btohqsg
i did a pizza order online  and it trigger 3DS and it was in the form i just described.So my guess is all merchants that use 3DS will be this form.I am loving HSBC Live+ so far. I think it is relatively easy to use and I am using it for Dining and Departmental Store.I am pushing out Dining and Department Store spending from my UOB Lady Cards so I have more of the $2k quota for UOB Lady Travel and Groceries categories.,btohqsg
You can still earn miles but no sub,btohqsg
apply through IRAS website. Have manual form and Internet Banking application methodshttps://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/forms/other-taxes-and-services/giro-application-forms,btohqsg
Citibank is an app popup.. you click on it and you approve.HSBC is totally no popup.. u have to click on the app and login before you get the approval prompt.,btohqsg
Not sure if I have time for that my tax deadline is July 6,btohqsg
Oh you are paying rent with cardup?,btohqsg
Thanks! Given that many of this method will take a few working days to be approved and that my deadline to pay tax is July 6  do you think it’s better I just pay the entire amount rather than giro? Quite concerned about any late fees,btohqsg
Urgent as I have a tax payment deadline on July 6,btohqsg
Think IRAS website can pay directly (No rewards),btohqsg
not sure if you started paying  can you still start the 12 months interest free instalment thingy,btohqsg
Yes  but then need to pay the entire amount?,btohqsg
Best to check w IRAS via Live chat about this (or email),btohqsg
Yep  for my own convenience  I usually use mobile app with biometric login enabled to approve the transaction seamlessly.,btohqsg
ok i think IRAS can discuss one.. Key is to get in touch with someone officially.Why not you call IRAS now (i think still office hours). Tell them honestly and see what they say,btohqsg
Ya. First time I do also blur. It’s not easy for first timer.,btohqsg
Hahah ya. I rent from my wife her living room for meeting for a day. Cheaper than go Marriott. Now Marriott no more 10N for meeting booking.,btohqsg
boss use cardup to fulfill dbs vantage sub har?,btohqsg
No worries. Didnt know you were paying rent. You can double check with dbs the mcc to be sure.,btohqsg
Yes. $50 cannot spend liao. Only spend $3950… 🥲30 days abit short.,btohqsg
i distinctly remember like rent can i think milelion chat got some thing abt this,btohqsg
Does anyone know if I don’t have a security token device for ocbc account  can I still use the app?,btohqsg
Yeah. Might have to…$50 short abit ai-wan if really kenna… 🫠,btohqsg
Trying to use the ocbc website on IRAS portal but can’t as it requires a token,btohqsg
