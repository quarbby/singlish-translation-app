Experienced driver will say doesn't matter  but many new drivers will mind if the body count is too many.,btohqsg

Not many places offer that though. Sometimes people also skeptical if the seller falsify it or not,btohqsg

New  1 are the flash ?,btohqsg
Which brand you use! Driveshaft just straight change to CF one!,btohqsg
Why thinner oil ah? Keep same grade change to high quality one more better sometimes they tell me,btohqsg
Oh interesting what sounds like a scam  that I gave an opinion saying people should be patient? Huh,btohqsg
You think is funny? Your behaviour is out of character,btohqsg
Maybe we should go about reporting everyone's text then  perhaps that will make you happy,btohqsg
What I said is simple and true and lots of people who can relate will understand that just because a trade is moving badly and they are at a loss at the moment doesn't mean it won't go back to bring profits,btohqsg
You're laughing  as long as an individual analysis is accurate and the trade should bring profits in little or no time which I said earlier that it takes patience to achieve that,btohqsg
So next time  read through a text before condemning and being all judgemental about it  do you understand,btohqsg
Higher grade? Can share the brand?,btohqsg
U think I give 2 shits about ur long texts? 0 so okay Bye ☺️,btohqsg
fat chance  but I hope some dealers will offer guaranteed COE at 10XXXX,btohqsg
Woah. My msg is in 3rd person,btohqsg
Nissan as reliable as other Korean/Japanese brands?,btohqsg
Does it make sense to buy a car now and when COE drop 1-2 years just scrap since paper value so stronk?,btohqsg
Other wise he needs to cut banana 🍌,btohqsg
Ya lor.. he hang out with admins.,btohqsg
Maybe he send admin F home also .You’ll never know,btohqsg
I have been looking at it since morning!,btohqsg
Hi can i askHonda fit 2009 or Mazda 2 2016Which 1 is btr,btohqsg
That's what happened when my dad bought an altis when coe was 20k  then dropped to 9k and he traded in the car within less than 5yrs and it was like a 1 to 1 exchange,btohqsg
But at over 100k now wanna drop drastically is very unlikely,btohqsg
Waiting for cat A to hit 140k,btohqsg
I think fit better if compared to mazda 2016...or was mazda 2016 already a marked improvement?? 🤔,btohqsg
Excuse me never go swimming today,btohqsg
My friend dreamt of a number,btohqsg
