i drove Myvi from sg to penang before ..took me 10 hrs to reach,btohqsg
Wow impressive. That u made it,btohqsg
i drive to desaru 160kmh damn scared alr,btohqsg
noob question... what is the average oil temp reading when ur car is running?,btohqsg
not say the road sibei smooth also,btohqsg
mine i hit about 103... then idle down to 90+,btohqsg
depending you have low-temp thermo stat  or oil cooler etc.,btohqsg
the reading when idle increase  when running decrease to 40,btohqsg
i think i should install a meter gauge to see see,btohqsg
yeah.. my old ride has den sold with car tgt,btohqsg
the middle one is oil temp.. u see the reading when idle,btohqsg
cooling weather will take longer to heat up,btohqsg
"sorry ah out of topic  how do y'all pronounce this beer har... pronounce as ""height"" or ""HeTeh""",btohqsg
but when I drive.. for more than 1hour.. then temp drop to 40,btohqsg
after driving 1hr he say haha,btohqsg
mine the oil temp takes about 5 - 10mins to warm up,btohqsg
you drive more than an hour should be hot alr,btohqsg
maybe inside no oil to take temp,btohqsg
even oil cooler also wont be 40,btohqsg
EO got operating temp it needs to be in,btohqsg
thicker oil also harder to warm up,btohqsg
but ya 40deg is way too low,btohqsg
either car got something wrong or the temp sensor got something wrong,btohqsg
Lol 40 is like cpu temperature sia,btohqsg
but if his water temp is to be trusted  his actual oil temp should be fine,btohqsg
ya the water temp 80deg is ok,btohqsg
water temp 70-80  engine temp drop when driving,btohqsg
temp drop when driving is normal  cos got wind to cool,btohqsg
but 70 also like abit low,btohqsg
70 is when oil cooler already,btohqsg
Eh... I think u check for leak first. the oil temp sensor area.,btohqsg
his 70 is water temp leh.,btohqsg
Those dial gauges shld be by sensors ba. No harm to double confirm with obd figures.,btohqsg
dials i rarely see obd one,btohqsg
ya.. i go back workshop now,btohqsg
unless got go through another box,btohqsg
maybe sensor picking up engine bay temp haha,btohqsg
