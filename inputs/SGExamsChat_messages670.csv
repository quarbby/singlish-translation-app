well if you got NS  I would say u can try apply to NTU & SMU CS  and take the time that you have to beef up your portfolio by doing your own outside projects,btohqsg

"“The main thing that I realised is that death is very close to us. I think that really made me more motivated to live life to the fullest. I don’t want to regret anything.""In 2023  Shannon Chong received a shocking call during class - her elder sister had died in a campervan accident in New Zealand. She recounts how she handled family matters  then took more than 3 weeks off school to go with her parents to identify and bring her sister's remains home - all during her A-level year.She tells CNA how she coped:https://cna.asia/48pjunT",btohqsg

You should get ur phd and come back to dhs to give a motivational talk,btohqsg
Then fcp is gnna say that she taught you before,btohqsg

Im half of that and i already want to cuddle in a corner and cry,btohqsg
i heard that pharmacy is more of like towards working with patients while pharm sci is more research geared?,btohqsg
true  now imagine my mental health rn 💀,btohqsg
Ppl in my course is toxic,btohqsg
cause i was actl quite interested in pharm as one of my options but im still thinking,btohqsg
I saw a banner in nus that says 1 in 3 students suffer from mental health issues,btohqsg
tbh idk la because i like to give ppl benefit of doubt,btohqsg
Maybe there's a pill for that,btohqsg
sg edu is damn stressful whos surprised,btohqsg
idk cause i wanna be a teacher but pharm sounds quite interesting as a degree,btohqsg
One of the most stressful ones in asia,btohqsg
Idk how it still stays as top uni in sg / one of the top,btohqsg
Other than that ye SG is the worst,btohqsg
i would nvr do that if ppl do bad things to me  i will never forgive ppl who lets say bully/betray/humiliate me yadiyada,btohqsg
idt there's a point of comparison on what's worse lol,btohqsg
"Ngl i prefer the ""1 exam determines ur future"" system compared to the ""consistent gpa system""",btohqsg
It happened in the middle of the night,btohqsg
it's a dumb thing to compare,btohqsg
I heard of students gettig jailed for cheating in exams in India,btohqsg
Ok tbh after coming to poly,btohqsg
But sad coz i think all or most of the commit suicide cases are international students,btohqsg
i mean if you prefer consistent gpa then poly is a good choice ba,btohqsg
but im more of a 1 exam so i chose alvls,btohqsg
i thought their pop q big,btohqsg
also i didnt want ib cause i didnt like the coursework components,btohqsg
You have a lot less control over your time,btohqsg
Same and also i didnt really know what i want qlso back then,btohqsg
Cause every module has to be good,btohqsg
And i must say it is way harder to get into uni fr poly,btohqsg
those big big countries dont have these kinds of compulsory military training lol,btohqsg
I don’t think it’s that bad,btohqsg
like im the type to flunk worksheets but get A for promos,btohqsg
so i dont think poly is a good fit for me,btohqsg
5 mental breakdowns in 3 years,btohqsg
yes i get a mental breakdown every other sem but it's all good,btohqsg
alot of my s4 classmates went to poly bc they dw a level stress,btohqsg
js curious joseph what's your poly course,btohqsg
Idk sia my cousin screwd up jc went to poly then did super well there,btohqsg
but i personally dl poly bc the course there not rly what i like,btohqsg
My 4.0 classmate is going through 1 vape pod a fortnight and like,btohqsg
tbh yea cause the type of stress is different,btohqsg
Mental breakdown u cannot score well alr,btohqsg
cause like for poly the stress is consistently there but not as big,btohqsg
bc it's stressful regardless just diff ways of working,btohqsg
but then for jc its more like it starts small and snowballs then at alvls its bigger,btohqsg
+ my classmates want more freedom also,btohqsg
But ye the issue with poly is that,btohqsg
I cry can take 2h to stop lmao,btohqsg
poly some mods cannot choose groupmates. you get goofy ahh groupmates who sabo ur proj then ur gpa is gone alr,btohqsg
next thing i know its finals,btohqsg
So much is dependent on luck,btohqsg
my s4 classmates damn obnoxious sia,btohqsg
only kuro can answer this question,btohqsg
Me for 4y stuck w idiots,btohqsg
they dye their hair purple pink colour then got acrylic nails,btohqsg
I would say both got their pros and cons,btohqsg
i always blank out during exam,btohqsg
I feel gpa u need to be consistently good,btohqsg
eh can you invite us to your public phd defence,btohqsg
still think it's a stupid reason,btohqsg
I always get stressed seeing ppl progress faster than me,btohqsg
And the thing about poly is that,btohqsg
like i rmb i went to some poly open house (as a joke la) then like wah seh the students there everyone got piercing one,btohqsg
But there is projects and assignments to pull ur grades up,btohqsg
mfw when people start walking out the exam hall 1 hour later when the paper is 2.5 hours long,btohqsg
Most of the 1st class / 2nd upper is toxic af,btohqsg
I had a bad experience during my internship,btohqsg
You shld ask them for their selfies,btohqsg
Thats why poly got one module for pe,btohqsg
Sway sway idk why all first class honours,btohqsg
Ye lol I hate poly internships,btohqsg
Then i got ostracised in front of the supervisor,btohqsg
So much influence over your grade,btohqsg
What course are u from ah bro,btohqsg
Given to one subjective fickle human,btohqsg
Are u gonna be prepared for mono,btohqsg
But ok la in army u can run u the king,btohqsg
Ippt gold marksman. Get both and u are free man,btohqsg
I hate running in the army,btohqsg
And I can’t shoot for crap LOL,btohqsg
Not just that I can’t stand those SAF regulars,btohqsg
for once RP got something right,btohqsg
Cant comment on this coz mine is actually nice,btohqsg
The regulars do treat me nice,btohqsg
Like thankfully I was blessed with chill supervisors,btohqsg
But some of my friends got screwed over,btohqsg
I like the NS compensation now though,btohqsg
Gonna save like 20k by the time NS is over,btohqsg
But no way I’m ever attaining that,btohqsg
Towards a carefully selected group of superiors,btohqsg
he say that vj did badly,btohqsg
but u say that did well,btohqsg
Thats not even half the size of RI,btohqsg
maybe my friend expectation damn high,btohqsg
The only down side is shag,btohqsg
vj mean dropped by almost 1 whole rp,btohqsg
i thought ej alw worse than vj,btohqsg
no wonder my friend so mad,btohqsg
sorry ah  apologising on behalf of my friend,btohqsg
i mean just settle his own score ma,btohqsg
he gives off exactly same vibe,btohqsg
like those scholars that only eat with other scholars during lunch,btohqsg
and they dont eat with non scholars one,btohqsg
too far from elitism  like what cow the sge mod sau also,btohqsg
kuro has a story from someone for every single situation,btohqsg
What’s the context here guys? ^.^,btohqsg
hold up i would say it is,btohqsg
My parents not happy coz i didnt get A for pw,btohqsg
my friends and i didn't feel that,btohqsg
it just a hype sch i suppose,btohqsg
yes it is... a handful leh,btohqsg
"bro back in sec sch  the O level people always flexed on us ""i'll go ri for jc and beat you for a level""",btohqsg
I said that to my parents ‘i will show u even in TM  i can beat u’,btohqsg
not on me of course 🥱,btohqsg
Since they like to flex on us their raffles background,btohqsg
bruh how old alr still flex sec sch/jc,btohqsg
My cohort did quite bad (mean was 71 i heard)  maybe that is why principal never reveal statistics,btohqsg
16 people in MI got 80RP or higher,btohqsg
My junior say teachers were shit talking about us,btohqsg
Not bad bah that’s like maybe 10% of the cohort,btohqsg
Its ok i also old fk,btohqsg
But i think even MJC only had ard 26 AAA/A,btohqsg
It gave me all inspiration to excel in TM,btohqsg
Show them the anti-elitist in me,btohqsg
my friend got as ans bs,btohqsg
I was surprised i got C,btohqsg
But me doing well in tm didnt stop my parents fr being elitist,btohqsg
I will slap them if they dare compare their psc and 1st class 2nd class upper status ACCOUNTANCY to a pharmacy degree,btohqsg
Failing so hard in math rn and I think I’m going insane.,btohqsg
My dad has been comparing us to his friend’s kiddos doing btr in psle and os,btohqsg
But A levels no one beat me yet hahaha,btohqsg
I’ve been failing since P3. I have no clue how I got here.,btohqsg
I actually lost so much of hair due to stress this year alone. It’s FEBRUARY.,btohqsg
It sucks working in govt i guess,btohqsg
I’m losing my mind for O’s dude it’s not even funny.,btohqsg
Why did they break their bond lol,btohqsg
I hate it that my friends will act surprised at my score but they hv been calling me mugger,btohqsg
And what a coincidence that both of your parents happened to be PSC scholars,btohqsg
Did they meet through the scholarship program?,btohqsg
I believe they met in MOF,btohqsg
Then what are they working as now,btohqsg
Get the hide company to pay,btohqsg
If u are good enough  it works,btohqsg
So they’re both in private sector now,btohqsg
Everything  literally everything. From indices  sincostan whatever that is  anything to do with algebra  I’m like LOST lost.,btohqsg
Lol get the MNC job at Harvard then bounce,btohqsg
I hate parents flexing on their children then when i get good  they act like nothing,btohqsg
Your parents both sound like huge overachievers,btohqsg
And say things like i think they mark wrongly,btohqsg
Just coz i mourning after papers doesnt mean i will do badly  it doesnt work that way,btohqsg
And in fact i seldom predict scores right,btohqsg
if my predicted scores were right  i think i wouldn't have gotten my bachelors alr,btohqsg
Sry it is a bit our of context if u read just that statement,btohqsg
they only glazing aft ri hci acsi,btohqsg
Tm only had 1 person got it,btohqsg
meanwhile my mom after getting my psle scores: don't go ri/hci  it's expensive!,btohqsg
Jesus man… that’s great for him honestly.,btohqsg
my parents dont even care abt cosg,btohqsg
Tbh everything changed after my psle,btohqsg
They didnt even expect me to qualify for JC,btohqsg
she was like nygh rgs all full of rich ppl,btohqsg
Fuck man. I’m sorry for you guys. I realise how privileged I am to have a dad that really dgaf bout my scores at this point.,btohqsg
Ri and hci are crazy elitist schools,btohqsg
It's not don't give any fuck,btohqsg
Wait but he self victimised and then acted like a dick or what?,btohqsg
But i entered tm the rong yr,btohqsg
depends on the people you talk to from there,btohqsg
Tbh i just wanted to show my parents i can do well in TM  dunnid RI,btohqsg
Mmm same. My dad just wants me to pass and get 15 below points for O’s. Pretty much that’s it.,btohqsg
my uni was a proving that i'm not stupid if i bother studying lmao,btohqsg
so how did they react when you proved them wrong,btohqsg
I’m trying to use rage / bloodlust as a studying weapon at this point. I think I’ll lose 70% hair by end of this year.,btohqsg
Yeah exactly my dad too. I get you fam.,btohqsg
Surprised coz i was mourning after the papers🤣🤣,btohqsg
But my year was covid collection,btohqsg
So they werent even in sch,btohqsg
i wish my parents expectations also dman low,btohqsg
"""maybe cambridge give the scores wrongly""",btohqsg
And principal didnt even announce stats,btohqsg
They not that happy abt me going jc one,btohqsg
Nono cuz they think work experience impt also,btohqsg
Parents nowadays seriously got 2 extremes,btohqsg

my parents believe in just mugging lmao,btohqsg
Just at least get diploma more likely get job,btohqsg
uni also can get work exp mah,btohqsg
They nvr force me one way,btohqsg
Can I use current 2023 GP and H1 Econs and retake only H2s in 2024? Since GP syllabus would be changing,btohqsg
maybe ur parents scared u cannot perform well in aʼs then cannot go nus or something,btohqsg
Dont mind me asking why u wanna retake,btohqsg
Its more like they don't like,btohqsg
Cuz they both not from JC bg,btohqsg

face reveal time for us to judge🌚,btohqsg
takes time to sink in and become sh mah,btohqsg
cause i feel like some of the jae students look more grownup than me and look like jc students,btohqsg
or maybe its because my ip friends look the same to me because they didnt change that much so they still look like jh self to me,btohqsg
and i also didnt change that much from jh to sh in terms of vibes and appearance,btohqsg
feel like its cause ure used to what u look like,btohqsg
