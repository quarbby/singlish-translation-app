I have charged it on the yuu card for my iPhone 15 pro purchase last Thursday and I just got the based yuu points from DBS. Not that some Singtel stores don't accept amex  so I only managed to use my Yuu visa for payment,btohqsg
Can check with the stores if they allow installment. I changed my purchase on 2 different cards. One yuu visa  one Citi reward card. Can't max out the yuu rebate since the Singtel shop did not accept Yuu Amex,btohqsg
I did not get the Yuu base points from SingTel. Just the DBS side. Bought the iPhone on launch day. Not sure if I should contact Yuu cs for help soon (they said 14 working days?),btohqsg

Hmm. Why not uob absolute? I have been getting 1.7% for $100.50 top up. (Includes 0.50 surcharge),btohqsg
Hi Sam  May I know Why only these 3 stocks? Have you explored other stocks? My view is that business cycles are getting shorter now and it is a stock pickers market at the moment. Hence  DCA is ok but build your position in a good company that can ride these short cycles. Keen to know your choices above before more can be shared. Not sure Sifu William have anything to add?,btohqsg
