Im not sure about whether hdb approval needs to be sought. But likely this 2-3 years will be added onto your MOP,btohqsg
you will need to apply for approval if you intend to rent it out. MOP will be added to makeup for the years you are renting out.,btohqsg
If you intend to sell after MOP  do not  do not rent out your unit.If you intend to stay after oversea work  do yourPOA(Power of Attorney) first before going oversea. Your POA can do according to your instruction in the POA.It is a good practice to have your POA done whether you want to sell or rent or do nothing before going oversea to work.You do not need to give HDB your POA if you are not renting or selling your unit.,btohqsg
