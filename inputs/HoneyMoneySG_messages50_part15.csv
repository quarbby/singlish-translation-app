Has anyone tried FinGPT for trading?,btohqsg

If I only trsf 2k into ega and make 5 trx and trsf out  and only trsf in again before giro due date  will the acc close? I plan to leave $0 inside at other times,btohqsg
You'll get the fall below fee based on average daily balance.If the balance ranges from $2k-$0 the average daily balance will be less than $2k,btohqsg

This worked today. So need to inform cashier that using Uob card.Wonder can still double dip with the standard Uob one cashback and bonus cashback,btohqsg
I don't see how LLM can help with trading. Computer algo has been used in trading since the late 80s. It is called quantitative analysis and the most profitable trading model to date,btohqsg
think that is the up to 10% cashback part,btohqsg
u mean 7/11 cashier gave you $1.20 additional off?,btohqsg
Yeah it should work separately and stack..so you spend $12 using UOB One at 7/11..cashier charges you $10.80 ($1.20 discount).. and the $10.80 earns 10% cashback from UOB One cashback program.,btohqsg
Sorry  did not follow through.  Last I knew was that MCC produced by XNAP was erratic and not consistent.  What's the latest for this issue?  Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Hello Gurus  UOB One the ADB for bonus interest is calculated only for the first 100K or for the total balance in the account.Ex : 105K for 15 days and 80K for 15 days 2775K / 30 = 92.5K or only 100K is considered for first 15 days and 80K for next 15 days which gives 90K ADB,btohqsg
Do anyone face the same issue as me..@chrisvideo on the left have ‚Äúusing CPF‚Äù options for OA to SA transfer.My CPF login portal in the right don‚Äôt have that options. May I know why?,btohqsg
1st one  cash top ups and cpf transfers,btohqsg
you need to sum up the daily ending balance for each day of the month  divide by the number of days in the month.,btohqsg
this should be the same formula for all other banks too for computation of monthly average daily balance.,btohqsg
Ah alright thanks. If its $0 will the fall below fee still be deducted into negative territory?,btohqsg
hi everyone  can I ask if anyone knows a work around to transfer money out of YouTrip (preferably back to a bank account)?,btohqsg
For the UOB 1 account  I‚Äôve to spend min $500 + credit salary of min 1.6K to earn the 3.85% interest  if I receive my debit card on 19 June and credit card today  will the spending period still be as per calendar month (1st to last day of the month)? Means by end of this month  even though it‚Äôs less than 2 weeks to spend.I went down to UOB branch  was asked to try the chatbot/call the customer service (CS). I tried all methods  chatbot with live agent cannot answer specific questions  called the CS  waited for 20mins  said have to transfer me to the rewards department  waited for another 20mins  rewards department only answers credit card questions. Rewards department wanted to transfer me to the debit card department but I don‚Äôt wanna wait anymore. ü•≤,btohqsg
$500 spending posted by 30 Jun.,btohqsg
fast network only for sgd. if fcy will be considered tt with charges,btohqsg
For UOB one -- do note that the salary crediting has to take place before month end too. one of my months  my salary was transferred slightly later  hit past the month into next. and it was deemed that i didn't clear the criteria.,btohqsg
of course  because uob wont know if its salary meant for which month. they will only follow value date of the credit,btohqsg
if closing to the end of month and still see no salary crediting  faster use fast transfer and indicate as salary to still get the bonus interest,btohqsg
is there any way to exchange usd from DBS to Revolut/Wise?,btohqsg
i believe any method of outgoing foreign currency will incur charges so may not serve the purpose you want,btohqsg
Thank you SG whisper  Kel Vin and Trazora. Appreciate your help and advices,btohqsg
It has been fixed many months ago,btohqsg
now all mcc 5814 for payment at hawker store,btohqsg
Hello gurus! I have a question about property loan. If I plan to buy a KL property  should I finance it using Malaysian bank loan or Singapore bank loan to finance the M'sian property? Thanks for the advice in advance!,btohqsg
Anyway  just tested. You can update your credit card billing cycle via UOB chat (w live agent) so you don‚Äôt have to wait on the call just to update the changes. ü§ì,btohqsg
Malaysia Ringgit loan. I saw an article that found shld you have loaned in SGD to buy malaysia property in around 2005 till now  you would have lost close to 30% from FX alone.I Don't see MYR going back to $2:1 against SGD anytime soon.,btohqsg
