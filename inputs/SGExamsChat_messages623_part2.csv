idk how smu is like but i think itâ€™s ok leh lol. plus ntu microecons 1 is a joke. some chapters cover really little content. plus microecons midterms so easy still got ppl cheat and the sch is not even doing anything about them. then microecons finals only test 5 weeks worth or content lol. 2.5h paper i finish in 50 min lol,btohqsg
Wait what's the cut off for,btohqsg
