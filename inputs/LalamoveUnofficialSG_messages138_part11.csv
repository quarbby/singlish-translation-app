Try to search lalamove website if there is any link,btohqsg
Lala app got problem is it,btohqsg
Why the fair now so little after cut,btohqsg
Example sembawang to bukit batok 10.50. After deduct around 8plus,btohqsg
The prices have definitely gone down in 2025  my guess is due to cpf needed,btohqsg
Maybe Customer pay $20 but we driver only see $15. The difference llm take to cover driver cpf,btohqsg
Nowadays see pooling  if customer ask me fasten,btohqsg
I’ll send the 24 hours screenshot,btohqsg
And tell them I’ll reach at tmr right before 24 hours,btohqsg
Make them wait 23 hours 59 mins,btohqsg
Haha.. no lah bro.. just trying to calm things down only..,btohqsg
U in another group chat with Dan is it?,btohqsg
No lahh. We know each other when you were still driving Noah. 🤭,btohqsg
Alamak bro.. i think u got the wrong person lah.. i never drive noah before.. 🤪,btohqsg
😂😂 how i wish can drive noah..,btohqsg
Avante sold already.. last yr.. now driving estima..,btohqsg
Knn same person take both but lala cheaper so he wanna cancel grab 😂😂 but before he cancel I cancel lala 😂😂,btohqsg
Bro can send here the screenshot U make ABT the pooling order so I can read n understand. Price is getting more ridiculous,btohqsg
It's not just pooling orders. Normal orders also very low price,btohqsg
N added in cpf deduction take even less,btohqsg
Saw this coming when gov started saying want make cpf compulsory for platform workers,btohqsg
But they say end of the day will be earning more because the platform need to contribute to our cpf. But seems like it’s just making it worse,btohqsg
Ya I agree. Too low price. N not enough of that  consumer also take advantage by ordering thru pooling,btohqsg
Llm will find a way to not have to use their own $ 😂,btohqsg
Either take from customer or us,btohqsg
And actually many platform workers need the cash in hand,btohqsg
Yes  cpf does have its uses,btohqsg
But I believe this move is the government feels all these yrs nvr manage to get any $ from platform freelance workers. So pretend say oh this is for our good  say we do survey and organise talks to get feedback and the workers say they want cpf,btohqsg
wanna check something... anyone using gogo also? my gogo app will sporadically go online by itself,btohqsg
Leave it until full (49) then it will not come out or log out,btohqsg
peak period also price damn rabak 😭😭😭,btohqsg
"I do the same thing also. The problem is lalamove doesn't say ""Delivery takes up to 24 hours"" on the user interface. Want us to give them good discount but at the same time fuck them also.Lalamove just here to fuck everyone",btohqsg
Ya  they wanna collect GST 9% from us sua already then still knn round up then become 10% pukimak,btohqsg
Saw one of lala ads on Google got 20% discount with code valid through 31 Jan. Pui,btohqsg
Any one have see this story at Facebook,btohqsg
Too many drivers on the road. Plus some accepted the orders scheduled the next day.,btohqsg
Now no peak period liao. All the same. Just shit prices😂,btohqsg
Hopefully CNY period have good rate 🙏,btohqsg
Now customer got new pattern..last min add in 1 more places and top up  $1+ only. Just wow..,btohqsg
They should put this is Lalamove charity order,btohqsg
Why LLM allow this to happen..... No QAQC...,btohqsg
I'm curious how LLM calculate this $0.50 or $1 pricing,btohqsg
Wah now can use this platform to ask drivers to do jobs eh?,btohqsg
I pass few days go fb n see than know,btohqsg
Can have the fb link? I cannot find,btohqsg
Ya just check for lunch time price since it's raining. Cialat price,btohqsg
