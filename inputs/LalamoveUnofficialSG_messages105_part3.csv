Done a half day trip to JB on the 1st day. Here are the updates to share with my fellow friends who which to drive up there.1) Make sure you download the apps MySejahtera on your phone . (It equivalent to our trace together apps but it for Malaysia use)a) Register your account either by your phone number or Email Addressb) There will be a glitch issue on the apps for us Singaporean cos we don‚Äôt have a home in Malaysia. So what you need to do is under address side you shall key in your SG address. For postal code   it will only recognise a 5 digit number b4 u can proceed. So just select any johor building postal code . For state   u need to key in b4 u can proceed and u can‚Äôt find SG so just put Johor.c) Once all is done you will b registered with the account.d) Log into the apps with the registered account   you need to submit a soft copy of your vaccination record (you can this extract from MOH side for the records)e) Go under traveller options than select oversea vaccination option and carry on filling up from there and remember to attach the soft copy of the record.2) For the first day of entering  SG toll is at $0.80 cents   the tolls is all waived at JB side for the 1st week from 1-7th Apra) No VEP is currently requiredb) Insurance is not needed at allc) You can do a test at the JB side on the T&G card if you still have it to see if it still valid.d) There are staffs there readily to sell you T&G if u need to buy one although you will not need it for this 1 week.e) For my case the JB side did not check anything  but I know from previous ones some people were to ask to see their phone if they have downloaded the MySejahtera apps.f) For now there no reports on them checking into the system to make sure you have the vaccination status so just carry a physical or soft copy just in case if they ask for it. (No harm right)3) Once you clear customs everything is back to usual  Street wise I think it still quite ok . There are still quite a number of shops around.a) So far I went KSL I see a occupancy of like 85% which is pretty good far from my expectation . Met a guy from SG he visited AEON mall he say that side was pretty ok too. So  you all still can do your normal shoppingb) So far I think the place is still ok but of course you still need to be careful but just act normal like everyone is you will be fine.4) Money Changer   So far I have seen the one at Petronas is open  the one at B point is open and only one in KSL is open at the lower level where the supermarket is. ( BTW TESCO in KSL is gone and replace by LOTUS)5) All petrol stations are operating6) Car wash  a lot of car wash shop have close down due to covid . I went to Legend at B-point the one when u exit from JB custom . A lot car wash are close around that area. Boss say they just started back to biz today. There are some other car wash around KSL side are open and the few popular car workshop are all still there.7) Coming back to SG make sure you have the health declaration fill up before you reach the counter else you will hold up the queue at the counter . This can be done prior to the arrival at SG anytime within 3 daysa) Under ICA website you can find checklist for fully vaccinated travellersb) Select And check Box C for SG arrival card and just do all the declaration and you are done.c) Once you reach the counter the system will show you done the declaration and the passport clearance will b fast. else you might hold up the queue behind you.D) For today case there are officers standby b4 we reach the counter to facilitate us the process faster as they know many of us are unaware of this.üòé That it and you will b back in SG . The process is not that difficult. Just additional stuff you need to do. But at least we get to travel right?,btohqsg
So which is the option you choice 2nd does or both or booster?,btohqsg
