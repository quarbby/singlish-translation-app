Ah so its cos of the bmw convoy,btohqsg
Yepps. The msian police probably will catch them at custom bah. Sure need to come back de mah LOL,btohqsg
If so that makes more sense. The gold bmw is obviously a c ock but i dont think he should be specifically targeted by the police like that,btohqsg
Msia Boleh lo. Hahaha. We see whats the news upcoming hahaha. Even last time speed in HW also can get caught le this is even more obvious haha,btohqsg
I think now singaporeans still very visible. Need to lay low and behave for a while until things normalise. Lol,btohqsg
world will be a better place........,btohqsg
Dont think can lea with such people around lol. any SG car go in will be judge even u are Myvi LOL,btohqsg
Still have alot hogging at first 2nd Lanes,btohqsg
u see how fast the 10 cars behind the gold bmw driving.,btohqsg
got msia ford ranger also  not only singapore plates,btohqsg
Honestly. Before covid i found most road hogging morons on NS highway were singaporean cars,btohqsg
U mean right lane? Just go 110 if dw to hog and give way to speeders will be fine lo,btohqsg
Yep. Problem is they wont give way. Just one sotong 110kmh all the way on the right lane â€˜cos speed limit already whatâ€™,btohqsg
Stupid local mentality. U see this all the time on our local highways,btohqsg
honestly this is the reason for 99% of 'aggressive driving',btohqsg
people wont overtake u from the left if overtaking lane clear,btohqsg
Agreed. It can be infuriating when ure in a rush to be somewhere,btohqsg
Then that one need to learn the msia HW code HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Dun say me lea i 100km/Hr on HW first lane de u wanna overtake u try lo. But if can siam i will lah,btohqsg
They are too stupid to have basic logic  reading the code also no use,btohqsg
But that video seems like they started off from traffic light or sth is it? Hahaha but nvm LOL,btohqsg
Same lah. But not everyone is like us. I always move over for faster traffic regardless of speed,btohqsg
As in The Mentality Give way Code on Msia HW,btohqsg
after the white mpv move left lane u see how many cars behind speed past hahahah,btohqsg
Yeah and i am like giving way to VANS going at 100km/Hr or more at Lane 1 LOL WHAT,btohqsg
At least he bother see his rear mirror HAHA,btohqsg
ya honestly if singaporean i think wont siam HAHAHA,btohqsg
lol if i saw a bicycle behind me at 100kmh i would still give way. Unlike many other sotongs,btohqsg
Hahaha a number of them heheh count us out Heh,btohqsg
Hahahahah who can do that HAHAHAHA.,btohqsg
Maybe got jet engine fitted lol,btohqsg
LoL their own also drove like that leh ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Moral of the story: i dont care how fast u going  on the fast lane  please give way to faster traffic,btohqsg
The art of hogging   our nation pride,btohqsg
Cause pay road tax and within speed limit I am the king,btohqsg
as a singaporean i being stereotype liao so sad,btohqsg
Yes some time the way they hog the lane I feel like so nicely executed,btohqsg
Make sure to leave no gap and maintian same pace with middle lane car,btohqsg
Make the leave a long long empty road infront   and a snake q behind,btohqsg
This is the art of hogging and some sinkie had master it   and will tell you that they had check with lta that within speed limit is not road hogging,btohqsg
Its hearing this BS excuse that triggers the hell out of me,btohqsg
Have you ever wonder   that the speed limit can be increase due to the overall efficiency and safety of current technology cars? Like overtaking lane speed limit is 20 km per hour more,btohqsg
It just make no sense that speed limits is the same for all lane,btohqsg
Slow lane I drive 90  middle lane 90   fast lane 90   how cars move around to exit and over take ?,btohqsg
Youâ€™re probably right but i doubt any of the civil servants or ministers would want to risk their careers on this because of the 0.00001% chance it backfires and accident rates skyrocket,btohqsg
They did talk about Speed limits during certain time to be lifted at a certain Range. Like Peak Hrs please maintain limit but where else there is lesser traffic period the limit is lifted or increased,btohqsg
When u make a million dollars a year to eat snakes for a living. Would you jeopardize it to help singaporean drivers out?,btohqsg
I mean 70kph on KPE is a complete joke. But there we have it,btohqsg
Most of the accident in the right lane is cause by over taking from left lane   and currently cars technology had really improve a lot   and most car come with anti collisions already   I drive car beside just auto pilot   I just feel like sleeping,btohqsg
How can 1 drive so slow,btohqsg
