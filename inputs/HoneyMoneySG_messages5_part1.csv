I have just tried to top up grab wallet using my true cashback card. It still works.,btohqsg
But I can’t use grabpay to top up my revoult card. And hence not able to top up crypto Visa card,btohqsg
What's the amount you try for me above 2k can't be done. I send out to revolut few amount smaller,btohqsg
Want to invest in S&P500  is S27 okay? Or must buy VOO? Using moomoo.,btohqsg
Something something about US tax and should buy the one in Ireland insteadI'm new to all these too but I think I read some article about it somewhere on seedly...,btohqsg
I also don't know either... I read but never pull trigger 😪,btohqsg
Thanks. S27 is listed on SGX tho  that's why I'm considering it over VOO. Also new to all these  don't really know if what I'm saying makes any sense haha...,btohqsg
Does this mean we can use the UOB Absolute Cashback Card to topup GrabPay card to buy crypto without any fees and get the 1.7% cashback?,btohqsg
You are right  i deleted that msg to avoid confusion,btohqsg
Though i believe going through revolut charged in USD may be better than the SGD spread by Gpmc,btohqsg
Reminder that don't charge Revolut on weekends as they will increase their FX spreads during Sat-Mon 8 am,btohqsg
Can it be done. I am also interested to know the answer.,btohqsg
Morning pple.. how do I get my amaze cashback out,btohqsg
I rmb something along the lines of trf to grabpay...?,btohqsg
Ok I know how already. Change to amaze wallet and then trf to grabpay card,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/aw5HHAjCu5MReferral code: NhkWBHWhy use Instarem Amaze?+ Favorable FX conversion rate+ No DCC Fee+ Add 1% cashback on top of your card rewards+ Tracked as online spending  even if you use the physical card or mobile contactless* Cashback received on 25th calendar day 1 month after calendar quarter* Cashback credited to Amaze wallet  which can be linked as payment method for your Amaze card* Use the amaze card (linked to Amaze wallet) to top up Grabpay Wallet  then proceed to withdraw Grabpay credits to your Bank account since it is withdrawable,btohqsg
Amaze card is very useful  if there are similar card for visa kindly share as well 🙏,btohqsg
Thanks Chris. Will there be any additional fees if I use Grab card to top up myCRO.comVisa card? The last round I use Grab to top up Revoult then top upCro.comVisa card.,btohqsg
The easiest way to know is just to give it a try😉,btohqsg
Has anyone try to use UOB One card to pay insurance using third party method like Cardup  renthero or ipaymy?,btohqsg
Base on Kelvin's video  you can pay your insurance using Cardup  and you pay Cardup using UOB One credit card with a 1.85%-2.25% fee. UOB One gives you 3.33% if you spend more than $500 each month for a quarter. So effectively you can earn 1.08%-1.48% and also hit the $500 minimum spending a month.https://youtu.be/DbOobqKFP-4?t=169,btohqsg
I wonder can CRO card be used in cardup??,btohqsg
Cardup actually has a 1.85% to 2.25% charge. So don't think it make sense.,btohqsg
Don't bother using cardup ipaymy unless you are hitting 5% on uob one,btohqsg
I'm having difficulty to hit $500 a month consistently for a quarter. And the variable is my Grabcar/Grabtaxi ranges from $200 - $600 a month. But I'm confident that my cardup ipaymy can hit the $500 monthly.,btohqsg
So what I'm hopefully can do is to use Cardup ipaymy to hit the $500 minimum monthly  effectively 1.08%-1.48% cashback.And unlock additional 5% on all my Grabcar/Grabtaxi and occasional shopee shopping  which is effectively 8.33%. Please correct me if my maths is wrong.,btohqsg
5% CRO card will make sense.,btohqsg
How do I use the CRO card to pay for my insurance to get the 5%?,btohqsg
I don't have CRO card or any coins yet. I don't have enough funds to put everywhere. So kinda need to work around,btohqsg
Hey all. Just to share. We can use Grab card to top upcro.comVisa card without incurring any additional fees. 👍👍😃😃,btohqsg
but iscro.coma eligible grab merchant? GrabReward points only eligible when paying grab merchant isn't it?,btohqsg
I think this would work ifUOB Absolute 1.7% > Grab top up/mastercard > Crypto card 5% (if you stake $50K) > AXS????Not a very pro in credit card counting.,btohqsg
Can some one verify from grab wallet to crypto card don't have FX fee nor dynamic currency conversion fee?,btohqsg
You need to stake 50K to get 5%?,btohqsg
I am also pretty worried. I did a top up of $50 on my Crypto card using Grab,btohqsg
The Grab never deduct any FX or dynamic currency conversion fees.,btohqsg
But can we get cash back using cro card on AXS? My main goal is to get cash back when paying my insurance.,btohqsg
Yes. So asking. Might do it if cro tank further.,btohqsg
Treat it as investment in crypto.,btohqsg
I'm still very new into personal finance  Very very new into investing. So don't have much money to put my money everywhere,btohqsg
So probably only able to get the 1% cro card. Haha,btohqsg
How about transfer money out from cro card? Do cro card eligible for the 1-8% cash back if pay bills via AXS?,btohqsg
Im curious on this as well 😂,btohqsg
Whats the best way to get cashback for insurance ? Paying for ILP qlso can ah?,btohqsg
ILP is worst insurance. Almost like scam Yr money.,btohqsg
Hey what are the fees like for withdrawing USD or SGD from Gemini to local DBS USD or SGD account?,btohqsg
Which cashback card allows for insurance payments to get cash back.  Anyone knows?,btohqsg
