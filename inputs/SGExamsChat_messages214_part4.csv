But to end off the discussion on overseas unis  in my opinion  if you are well off  and feel that the overseas experience is a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' thingy etc then go for it,btohqsg
is almost impossible to get  but u can try,btohqsg
almost all US universities don't offer scholarships to international students,btohqsg
they offer need-blind financial aid though  only for a select few,btohqsg
but usually not a lot of ppl qualify for it,btohqsg
singaporean life is alr quite good,btohqsg
feel that sometimes Singaporeans complain too much over small stuff,btohqsg
and more urbanised if u live in the city,btohqsg
a bowl of laksa in singapore is $3,btohqsg
If you live the suburbs like a lot of people,btohqsg
but my qn to you is  will u do that?,btohqsg
many won't  unless they own a car,btohqsg
That’s because in USA the servings are easily twice the size,btohqsg
The McDonalds meals there are huge,btohqsg
lol u clearly never been to US before,btohqsg
definitely a plus point compared to singapore,btohqsg
but not a veto reason why i will go US,btohqsg
but food portions is the same ah,btohqsg
I just prefer life in a more rural  less restrictive place,btohqsg
i dont think singapore is that restrictive either,btohqsg
singapore is better in terms of how everywhere is considered quite close  and travellin across the island isnt so long  even though it take 1.5-2hrs,btohqsg
It’s small  everything is urbanised  hardcore education system that I think doesn’t cultivate stuff like creativity and independence,btohqsg
ofc living in suburbs is cool and all  but I guess there will be quite some challenges ahead also,btohqsg
then have u ever wondered why singapore has to be in such a state today?,btohqsg
but if you legit want a more rural  agricultural life  you should consider overseas other than Singapore.,btohqsg
I don’t mind urban life but I would definitely want a backdoor too,btohqsg
basically you want the cake and eat it too la haha.,btohqsg
I feel that usually we tend to see the good side of stuff,btohqsg
until we experience it  then we start to miss the former,btohqsg
but who knows  u may truly enjoy it,btohqsg
dont need to stress so much about overseas uni etc etc now,btohqsg
then u roughly know if u can go for it  or not,btohqsg
Idk if I even want JC anymore,btohqsg
do you know what u want to do in the future,btohqsg
Not much opportunity to learn extracurricular stuff when you’re constantly studying,btohqsg
if u go poly ur chances of going overseas are way lesser than going jc,btohqsg
well that's really up to you. if you can manage your time well  you'll always have time for extracurricular stuff,btohqsg
the only poly person i know in this grp who made it to overseas had almost 4.0,btohqsg
in my 3 years in MI  I've had a chance to go overseas basically every year,btohqsg
just that I turned down 2/3 of those opportunities lol,btohqsg
JC different luh since it's 2 years only,btohqsg
Like how exactly does MI offer overseas opportunities,btohqsg
overseas cultural exchanges  VIA trips  etc,btohqsg
every JC  and MI can offer it every year,btohqsg
only issue is whether ppl wanna go for it or not,btohqsg
my sch wants every student to go overseas at least once in their journey in the sch,btohqsg
i mean even in secondary schools  overseas immersion trips are becoming more frequent also,btohqsg
"so it's not like JCs are like ""no don't go overseas stay here and study your ass off""  instead it's quite the contrary",btohqsg
Issue is idk if I can even get into a good JC lol,btohqsg
Confirm gonna mess up my L1R5,btohqsg
