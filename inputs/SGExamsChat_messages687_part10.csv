Pw groups are internally decided i think so the cher should be able to do sth to prevent it,btohqsg

If it is a u problem  then u wun hv friends at all,btohqsg
Im a girl saying this but ya,btohqsg
i told my school friends about this,btohqsg
they were very understanding and gave me a listening ear,btohqsg
sometimes  my guys clique dont understand why the girls cliques suddenly got beef also,btohqsg
i also told them not to tell anyone and to pretend like they have not heard anything,btohqsg
i have just texted my ct to let her know that i wish to be grouped with anyonebutthem!,btohqsg
hope it all works out smoothly,btohqsg
and i will just ignore  if they want to take revenge iʼll tell the discipline master to give them detention or a bad conduct grade.,btohqsg
this will deprive them from uni scholarships and opportunities,btohqsg
Lol but in reality that’s a very tiny population to begin with,btohqsg
that will mean that they have 0% chance of getting those opportunities.,btohqsg
but since they are girls... well too bad they cant get any form of corporal punishment. they can just be put under in house suspension,btohqsg
how comfortable are you in letting your parents get involved?,btohqsg
