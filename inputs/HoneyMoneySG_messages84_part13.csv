When is the best time of the month to apply for T bill using cpf so that I won't lose so much interest?,btohqsg
Is it worth to earn the grow bonus from OCBC360?,btohqsg
Depend. I don't park my cash long 1 place. This Jan I've withdrawn approx 40-45k to top up wife  self cpf  srs  buy tbill etc. So cash grow in ocbc will not meet.,btohqsg
Hi anyone know if dbs live fresh cash back card is based on calendar date spend or statement date spend?,btohqsg
Bro  sensitive question lehü§´. You may like to refer to this ocbc link.https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/deposits/360-savings-account#section-interestcalculator,btohqsg
Thanks sir. So if i spend $800 ($400 mobile contactless  $400 online) in jan  even if the cc statement payments split to separate dates (statement for jan and feb) it doesnt matter right? Will be charged based on the calendar spend?,btohqsg
Calendar month spend. If it is installments or BNPL  never tried with Live Fresh so can't say.,btohqsg
Can we use the deposit of $10k for 5 buy trades on etf?,btohqsg
Hi guys  need your advice abit  do you think parking your money long term with manulife investments saving is good idea? Every month need to save 1k up to 10 years and the 14 th years only can take back the principal plus maybe 7-10 percent return of total principal. Someone approaching me about this but I was thinking 14 yrs to take back my 120k is very long,btohqsg
Are All figures shown are projected n not guaranteed?,btohqsg
Every month will send statement. The agent told me the return of 8 percent will be written in the contract policy as well,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if I pay my HSBC Revo bills earlier than the statement date  would I be able to earn points for amount that I‚Äôve spent in excess of the $1k limit for 10x reward points?,btohqsg
Max $1k of rewards points is nothing to do with if you pay earlier or not. It is max $1k. Answer is no.,btohqsg
There is should be another clause in agreement to protect the insurance company that under certain circumstances they company may not be able to pay 8% per annum or may extend the 14 years to longer period. Eg.20 years..Read the agreement carefully before signing it. Good luck to you.,btohqsg
Never ever buy ILPs. Many hidden cost around. Only buy insurance product from Insurance companies. Not investment,btohqsg
Ok  noted  thanks for your advise bro,btohqsg
Ok noted  thanks for your advise bro,btohqsg
Did the agent mention 8% guaranteed or simply say 8% mentioned in the policy‚Ä¶ ya must read carefully before u sign.. from what I know.. first 3 years u are paying about 50% of your premium as the agent‚Äôs commission.,btohqsg
Hi. For atome+Citi rewards  what does manual payment mean? Last month  I go to bill and click pay now for December installment. Today I check  it still consider offline and no 10x points üòî,btohqsg
Nope. Amaze need pay 1% fee for mcc 5999 right?,btohqsg
Indeed  the Agent did mentioned the return is not guaranteed  but he said the 7-10 percent return will be written down in the policy. I think I need to check the policy very carefully. But I don‚Äôt think I will go for it. 14 yrs is too long,btohqsg
think that is the only way to be sure it is online though,btohqsg
Either pay 1% to get 10x points or get nothing. U need to decide on this.,btohqsg
Ohh. I thought manual payment will become online transaction. Seems like it's bo bao also. üòî,btohqsg
Just to share with you. I bought life insurance many years ago. Agent presented then the projected return was 3.5% -4.5% every year.Many years later  The insurance company continue sending me company annual fund performance report every year. Their return on the fund is 6%-8% every year.But when I read my statement every year last few year  only 1.6% credited into my account. Luckily I did not put a lot of money on this,btohqsg
Already shared many times. It have many hidden cost. Such as spread between buy and sell price. Up to 10%.Funds cost around 3% management fee.Insurance cost not transparent. Probably more than usual.Maybe some unknown cost around. ü§îü§î,btohqsg
Ya it‚Äôs written inside but if it‚Äôs not guaranteed  you could get lesser  can you stomach the loss of your earning after 10 over years is at 2-3%? I think you better don‚Äôt sign ILP if you don‚Äôt know how it works leh  cus it‚Äôs a lot of hidden cost and a lot of money  better to put in guaranteed bank savings Acc or money market fund (in my opinion).. you are just funding half of your first few years of your money to the agent‚Äôs commission   unless u have extra cash and u don‚Äôt mind then ok la,btohqsg
I see  thanks for sharing. This is the things I afraid  agent usually projected based on the last 10 yrs performance of their invested fund. future 10 yrs no one knows. Saving for 10 years leh  many things can change. I need to think carefully,btohqsg
And the projected didn't accounted the management fee. And other hidden cost.After deducted all this  it shld be maybe less than 1% roi per year. üòú,btohqsg
If UOB one savings account  I only credit salary without spending how much interest am I going to get?,btohqsg
context is that I spent $1k in late December and this transaction wasn‚Äôt posted to my jan statement. So I was wondering if I could pay off early to get points for my transactions in feb?,btohqsg
Yes  it is true. thanks for your great advice. I need to think carefully and check the policy then decide. Have a great üëçüèª weekend,btohqsg
The projected return is the overall fund projected return of the company  not the return that will be credited into your account. If you asked me  I won‚Äôt spend more than 30 seconds to talk to an insurance agent on this.Just say ‚ÄúThank you  not interested  bye‚Äù to the agent.,btohqsg
the $1k is posted on which calendar month?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA is only 1.05% p.a.,btohqsg
Based on posted date  not based on how much you pay. Just use other cards in the meantime,btohqsg
Okie  thanks bro for your advise   you save me fall into a 14 yrs hole üòÜ,btohqsg
Think it will be posted in my jan statement which is due in feb. Ps for the confusion  was trying to say that the dec transaction was not posted in time for statement due in jan.,btohqsg
dun need care about statement  which calendar month it is postedbonus points capped for $1k eligible spend posted in calendar month. Your statement month or when u pay dun matter,btohqsg
That is a damn deep hole.,btohqsg
Calculator here will help you figure it out -https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.page,btohqsg
So for the $1k that I‚Äôve spent in dec would be eligible for bonus points for the month of dec (even tho it‚Äôs posted in Jan)  can I still continue using the card now to get bonus points for Jan assuming I‚Äôve not yet max out the $1k in jan?,btohqsg
no  if posted in Jan then already maxed out for Jan,btohqsg
Does grab top count as CIMB infinite first 1k spending,btohqsg
Ok got it  thank you so much!,btohqsg
