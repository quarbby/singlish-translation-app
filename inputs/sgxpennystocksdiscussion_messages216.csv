it just becomes another Brexit bargaining chip for the EU to use against the UK,btohqsg
at that point  it would be in the US's interest to supply food to the UK before the EU,btohqsg
Top glove giving 5 cents dividend soon time to load!,btohqsg

Congrats my GKE holders. This stock I have shouted like mad. All should win. My last call was to ask you guys collect $0.085. Would have been a crazy win in 2 weeks ? Well done to those who followed,btohqsg

Vv3 just need a trigger ..can gap up to mid 70,btohqsg

Ya. Ben caught the Jerry virus. 😆😆😆,btohqsg
I holding my vv3 at 70 for 2 weeks + already  want to offload above 80 at least  no less,btohqsg
If 68 clear then good. Volume churning play by them,btohqsg
68 is to churn volume? Only 2 orders. 500k and 25k,btohqsg
The VV3 stacks very nicely lined.Now   I invite Vividthree BBs to start the performance,btohqsg
vividthree dayw2 in wabc formationw2 66 px hit 66now is critical,btohqsg
To get into Top 30 volume need to cross 5000 lots volume . Let’s see,btohqsg

Same for v2y net outflow red but goes up,btohqsg
One chan the other is Dr koh cordlife right,btohqsg
sold long time ago at 27 when it rebounded,btohqsg
Dr Koh Cordlife cofounder is the independent director of VV3.He recently bought shares of VV3   over. 10 000 lots at $0.070(sept 2020)This brought about attention to this counter I reckon,btohqsg
If vv3 cross 70 will fly,btohqsg
the blocks all started to disappear,btohqsg
whats his useridwhole street of JJ,btohqsg
Ya..got his message too..o deleted straight,btohqsg
but also say no common group.,btohqsg
Is vp going to fly too,btohqsg
Everytime LB got 800 shares buying that day will chiong.,btohqsg
The regulators got mention the vaccine should still work even with the new strain  but pending confirmation,btohqsg
Tested a small sell vivid 69. Buyer is macquarie and HSBC. Lets go!,btohqsg
ya so the bet on the confirmation is a big one. a sleeping loss trade haha,btohqsg
Nah not venturing into medical. Risk way too big now with limited upside imo. When they down  they fall pretty quickly,btohqsg
Those manage to scoop at 24 huat ah,btohqsg
agree. i think got upside but equivalent or even more downsidefor the good of mankindi hope the new strain is just an excuse for bb to buy cheap other stuff.,btohqsg
Hyphen 320 keep topping up sia,btohqsg
Even if existing vaccine doesn't work on new variant  think Pfizer and Modena can still make a few modification on their vaccine and be ready in a month or two.,btohqsg
New technology makes vaccine  quick and easy.,btohqsg
I hold MT but I also hope the virus get beaten soon and world goes back to normal. Think MT without virus is still a strong pick. The CEO already projecting beyond covid and it looks good for them.,btohqsg
All medical plays have amassed big capital in pandemic now focus should be on management plans and executionLikely diversification will happenJust hoping not buying crap for sake of buying,btohqsg
MT benefited strongly from the pandemic no doubt. It is a catalyst for them to get on the world stage and be get recognition. Now that they have a bigger share of the market  they don't really need to rely on virus news anymore. Though the threat of Disease X still hangs around and govts around the world definitely will stockpile more and not be caught with pants down again.,btohqsg
If one is hoping COVID to get worse just do your medical shares can riseWhat difference is there between u and the black hearted merchants who produced food that poisoned and killed people (such as the toxic milk powder case in China years back)May argue you didn’t cause it unlike the milk powder producers.However they didn’t set out to kill anyone. Just want to maximize profitsIf your life stands in the way of profits  too bad u can die as long as they get the profitsIn this sense is similar to medical shareholders too?,btohqsg
Think any stock we can buy will always have some bad parts about them. Buy gold  oil  lumber get blamed for toxic environmental waste...etc,btohqsg
Those not vested can watch. Personally 3 stock heavily recommended as of now. Jiutian/medtec/riverstone,btohqsg
MT likely will be quite strong after all the things die down,btohqsg
Wah first time see hamper give monopoly,btohqsg
No le i just say i do trade a bit here n therr than bang,btohqsg

Jiutian let just buy Low sell high  same as riverstone and medtec,btohqsg
Riverstone tiagong privatisation in the pipeline,btohqsg
Medtec no need say they going to dominate us market for the next few years,btohqsg
Hello...1-2 yr max den will have ppl go kaciao liao... haha. Now got ppl start incorporate in usa also liao,btohqsg
Medtec With the amount amass   they no need raise capital from market Liao. They can go privatise as well. Heehee,btohqsg
It was telling that the CEO mentioned during one of webinars that their main competitors now are 3M and Honeywell....no longer a small fry in a village pond.,btohqsg
Cement got so many walls to clear. Makes it so scary to everyone... really a cement stock. 🤣🤣,btohqsg
It doesn't matter who MT see as their competitor.. it only matter when 3M and Honeywell see MT as competitor,btohqsg
PCK wifeyour morning prayer work for MT 👍,btohqsg

panunited dayw2 280cloud 285px need to stay above 285then high chance w3 come,btohqsg
So sian. Prices either Cha Cha or tanking 🥱🥱🥱,btohqsg
Today T+4 PanUnited .16th December price was 290/295 after announcement of breaking national record of cement pour.They did a good flushing for those who bought in after the news catalyst came out.Possible w3 as earlier on  there were even bites all the way up to $0.305 on 25th Nov 2020zI believe early accumulation have taken place more is to come considering that they are working non stop round the clock which indicates they should be doing well business wise.,btohqsg
Back to same old days.Medical bull all the way till 2021.Huat,btohqsg
Like that Chiong meh? Down from above 33 leh,btohqsg
Added $0.285 PanUnited. Good luck to me and all holders ! Hope for a w3 to come !,btohqsg
Paging for PanUnited BBs.Please be nice. We have been really patient,btohqsg
You mean the BBs are in our telegram ah? 😆😆😆,btohqsg
Just trying my luck here. Who knows yea . Hahaha.,btohqsg
They should be here .  They have to know what retailers want to play,btohqsg
Ya  I suspect possibility all along. 😆,btohqsg
Previously $0.285 have block because they want to flush likely. But earlier on I saw buyers already willing to buy up all the way to $0.305.So let’s see.,btohqsg
Bb I don’t want MT abalone and LB to go up,btohqsg
For easy reference . Warren’s research,btohqsg
PAN-UNITED ACHIEVES SINGAPORE’S LARGEST TWO CONTINUOUS CONCRETE POURS WITHIN A MONTH• Record largest continuous concrete pour of 18 916 m3 in early November followed by continuous pour of 18 342 m3 two weeks later• Sustainable Grade 55 temperature-controlled flowing concrete (PanU Cool) specially designed to prevent cracking during pour16 DECEMBER 2020https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/FK8GNF3Q8B31O63W/642511_Pan-United_Concrete_Mass_Pours.pdf,btohqsg
☝️PanUnitedchart is showing up SHS bottom characteristics. Need a breakout rise above 30.5c to confirm.Potential 🎯1st 34c (SHS measured move)2nd 38c (close gap)3rd 42.5 (retest mar high),btohqsg
Don't lie to them hor later they angry they buy 10pips up,btohqsg

If later last 15mins MT Chiong to 110 how ah? 😱😆,btohqsg
Buy queue MT at 105 suddenly so big.,btohqsg
mt bb suddenly stack 105 buy q be careful,btohqsg
given cimb maybe they planning a rug pull,btohqsg
sorry  your ang mo very cheem... meaning entice retailers to chase  then sell down after trapping retailers?,btohqsg
Rug pull - a manipulation tactic used by large institutions that have the capital to affect share price. If you have access to level III  you can see all the orders waiting to be filled at every price point. You'll sometimes see a VERY large order waiting to be filled at a specific limit price. This level will act as support or resistance  but sometimes this massive order will suddenly disappear (cancelled) and the price will rise or fall accordingly very quickly. It happens all the time.,btohqsg
thats what i found on reddit haha,btohqsg
Today supposed to have some astrological event right,btohqsg
What if got sandstorm and pollutants in the air,btohqsg
Today is 21 dec in the other side of the world,btohqsg
Haha my house never wash floor also got dust,btohqsg

Wah mai la don’t come this fill gap shit again,btohqsg
yesterday closed 995  today opened 1.,btohqsg
Haha yea sia I hear gap my heart pikpok pikpok leh,btohqsg

I wfh until my thigh also gap filled alr,btohqsg
think mt alot ppl short at 106,btohqsg
😆😆😆 because is medical stock day mah.,btohqsg
I never understand the fundemantal reason for a gap fill,btohqsg
107 nobody bite alot so 106 shortist all come out,btohqsg
@furion07Btw what you guys think of eindec? Now relative cheap,btohqsg
Lol left less than 2 hrs not worth to short,btohqsg
me too  can someone explain if they know why 😂 appreciates 🙏,btohqsg
Yeah all I know is it will happen  but not the reason why,btohqsg
Normally shortist don aim big  got meat can liao😆,btohqsg
I dont see any meat to short at 1.06,btohqsg
These fills are quite common and occur because of the following:•Irrational exuberance: The initial spike may have been overly optimistic or pessimistic  therefore inviting acorrection.• Technical resistance: When a price moves up or down sharply  it doesn't leave behind anysupportorresistance.• Price Pattern: Price patterns are used to classify gaps and can tell you if a gap will be filled or not. Exhaustion gaps are typically the most likely to be filled because they signal the end of a price trend while continuation and breakaway gapsare significantly less likely to be filled since they are used to confirm the direction of the current trend.,btohqsg
mr lin lao pei is eindec expert can check with him,btohqsg
Haha medtecs if can break 107 resistance then steady bah.,btohqsg
Hope so then got chance gap up tml,btohqsg
IPS large queues are back. Few days ago they pumped to 84 and dumped to 76. Lets see what the game this time is,btohqsg

difficult to play when gloves counter and MT going up     rather prefer other counters slowing moving up !!,btohqsg
I removed Avarga from my WL already long ago. 🤨,btohqsg

If price close 90 is good . Strong chance of reversal with the double hammer,btohqsg
yea today close 0.090 will do. then set up looks good.,btohqsg
IPS considered break up already right?,btohqsg
Never know bro... Few days ago went 84 then dump to 76,btohqsg
Hope tmr IPS gap up? 😆😆😆,btohqsg

Tomo MT shld gap up  they cover all gap,btohqsg
Vivid tight range today. Hopefully more play tmr,btohqsg
If company buy.bk of cos slow slow,btohqsg
LifeBrandz very interesting  last min got 8m buy q come in to support at 24,btohqsg
Yeap. Close above previous high 1.03,btohqsg
personal opinion lb bb might be distributing as px reached high again but with much lesser vol & momentum,btohqsg
wow gke 103 all taken up,btohqsg
lb 1h timeframe divergence spotted as px makes higher high but momentum weakens,btohqsg
hmm it closed the gap by closing 10 today  i think still need to monitor next few trading days to see,btohqsg
Back when I called bought back $0.085 and made call 2-3 weeks back. Not  many bought when there was plenty chance to collect cheap at $0.085.But now cross $0.10  many want to chase and collect. I guess that’s just how it is. FOMO and Herd Mentality is real!,btohqsg
the place T+4 closed at 36 support with higher vol than past 2 days  looks abit precarious need to see if 36 holds tmr,btohqsg
There is a positive profit guidance on its logistics and cement business which generate higher profit ... this is the catalyst,btohqsg
At 5.08  1 million over GKE shares was gobbled up 🤔,btohqsg
Consolidation at 36-43. I believe alot contra players got forced out already. But yeah need to see if 36 can hold tomorrow LOL,btohqsg
How abt ur tot on v2y?,btohqsg
Good thing is today $0.285 no blockers for PanUnited and not much selling on T+4. It is likely most of the volume done by the BBs themselves/stronger hands. More to come for PanUnited. At least now  they have a good catalyst to make the run up. Good luck. DYODD. Watch the roads  you will defintely spot their fleets  day and night  rain or shine. Looks to me they are rushing jobs. Hence  expecting them to perform well in their upcoming results. Play this  best can hold. All my hold stocks  Hanwell  GKE have performed well. Pan United will be next.,btohqsg
Yea very nice set up indeed,btohqsg
Yeah master yuan did chart for y ventures last week. Might on W5 if all goes well,btohqsg
Yea  nice w5. Hope so. loaded 700 lots already. Good luck to us all!,btohqsg
Any insights or upcoming earnings etc.?,btohqsg
Trading only bro. Contra play.I think this one in play. Considering how it ran last week to 87 open and to 99. Now T+4 good to collect because many weaker hands flushed. Today closing is good. Nice set up. Double hammer reversal,btohqsg
Haha OK thanks for the info,btohqsg
Dun understand why ppl wanna short hip,btohqsg
