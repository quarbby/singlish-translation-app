Eh don‚Äôt dox  also wait until this sem results come out,btohqsg
that makes me inclined to take cs now,btohqsg
I wanted to nope so hard after taking h3 physics lol,btohqsg
if ur gpa higher than me its just u less normal than me XD,btohqsg
LOL i would have fapped to h3 chem ngl,btohqsg
i dropped to 3.97 in y2s2 cause i tanked a C+ then climbed back up to 2nd upper yeet,btohqsg
Physics in electronics and electrical engineering,btohqsg
icic  are u very good in math tho?,btohqsg
Chim. Tho I took almost everything in engineering,btohqsg
guess ima give cs a shot,btohqsg
i SUed every math mod except stats,btohqsg
I just had a mentally ill guy helping me out  you know who he is >_>,btohqsg
literally shouted in the staff room today that i wanna be a tuition teacher üòÅ,btohqsg
Prepare for your social credit to drop,btohqsg
Aww u remind me of him,btohqsg
Can a tutee play üèÄ with the tutor?,btohqsg
another person that's gonna mysteriously vanish,btohqsg
;) y don't u ask tuition,btohqsg
It is up to the tutee to make use of it,btohqsg
Wow u can do tat. Haha,btohqsg
Go NUS ask those that have potential to excel ah,btohqsg
If the tutee doesn‚Äôt care then no amount of tuition helps,btohqsg
Then tutor laughing all the way to bank,btohqsg
More reasons why tuition should be banned,btohqsg
More reasons why tuition is a predatory industry and should be banned,btohqsg
thats like saying why all ACS students should be executed,btohqsg
Nooo I actually need to be tutored  have mercy,btohqsg
y?  They so cute and innocent,btohqsg
Why do you need tuition?Answer: Teachers in school not good enough/not enough Teachers,btohqsg
can someone just stab me alr,btohqsg
i had a friend who did that,btohqsg
Just spend time then get salary,btohqsg
Nono I‚Äôm just not good with school schedules cuz I‚Äôm not good at having attention:P,btohqsg
And you think a tutor would be able to do better than a teacher in this case,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the second scenario: not enough teachers,btohqsg
Yes that‚Äôs the first scenario: Teachers not good enough,btohqsg
im a good tutor but sadly different course,btohqsg
thats basically every other industry also,btohqsg
i pity my current student in sch who has a chem tutor who milks his tys as practice,btohqsg
Means the tutor uses TYS questions to help the tutee practice,btohqsg
basically he/she utilises his TYS as practice for every single lesson,btohqsg
when thats supposed to be for sch use,btohqsg
Why not hire good tuition teachers and give them higher pay,btohqsg
dude I wonder if people would do like wsdc in telegram,btohqsg
It is rather difficult to match pay in the private sector,btohqsg
Mhmm but if they can guarantee much better results,btohqsg
Create a telegram group  6 speakers each take turn to write an essay,btohqsg
Honestly I think you pay for the ratio more,btohqsg
Like my school for one of my subjects I had a ratio of 1 : 6,btohqsg
I doubt the tutors are any much better than MOE teachers in terms of quality,btohqsg
not if they are MOE JCTIP quality,btohqsg
Quite unrecommended by MOE I believe they advise a ratio like 1:15-20,btohqsg
I have never attended tuition but I heard some tuition centre produce straight As,btohqsg
Have you actually considered giving tuition,btohqsg
its called 'riding on the coat-tails of other's hard efforts',btohqsg
That‚Äôs impossible for any large number of students,btohqsg
i will nvr take credit for a student's result 100%  at most 30% of it.,btohqsg
I am helping out my friend‚Äôs brother with homework,btohqsg
I believe pedagogy makes lots of diff,btohqsg
yes  but a ton of ppl do it also,btohqsg
But well  I don‚Äôt get paid for it,btohqsg
Maybe I can aspire to become a good teacher,btohqsg
oh I thought is some MOE tip rule,btohqsg
worst part is when the whole unit calls you out,btohqsg
but they just accept what u do,btohqsg
unpaid help is not so your ok,btohqsg
Not that John Smith from moetip or anything,btohqsg
I know this really good tuition centre in Marymount,btohqsg
Sir I don‚Äôt think you understand what I was trying to do but ok,btohqsg
Also have a lot of As,btohqsg
Hahaha I don't need tuition thx,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not up to you whether or not you can enrol,btohqsg
u realise if independent institutions are excluded  the cohort of sg actually didnt do that well for A lvls,btohqsg
Yes  ACSI is causing A Levels scores to inflate,btohqsg
how about we redistribute ‚Äòwealth‚Äô in schools,btohqsg
by wealth I mean Teachers ü§©,btohqsg
The top 1% of students get 99% of the teachers,btohqsg
I also heard another popular theory honestly,btohqsg
I heard they‚Äôre proud of getting many people scoring 45,btohqsg
That like people in that tuition centre do well because they already can do well like in terms of self study,btohqsg
and that Teachers have a minimal impact in some cases,btohqsg
Merely knowing does not equip u with skills to tackle questions,btohqsg
guys what are your views on japanese curry,btohqsg
i feel like its sweet sweet and sweet,btohqsg
Skills is also something you can self study from notes though,btohqsg
It helped me get my H3 merit,btohqsg
If u can study skills from notes u wouldn't need practice at all,btohqsg
Btw a question is H3 research worth it,btohqsg
Learn something you aren‚Äôt really expert on,btohqsg
Anyone can help me here really would appreciate,btohqsg
and also because their attitude towards studying makes them A material also,btohqsg
"really up to you to decide whether it's ""worth it""",btohqsg
I mean how is the experience generally,btohqsg
I have not gone through the programme there must have been some feedbacks from seniors or smth right,btohqsg
i mean some people actually learn more from their tutors tho,btohqsg
What do u mean  the research institution?,btohqsg
some schools dont encourage it though cause you get marked based on your end product and research isnt guaranteed to succeed,btohqsg
Science specifically computing or material science,btohqsg
+ you won‚Äôt be able to take another H3 unless you appeal or sth :s,btohqsg
Yep I'm intending to cross my fingers,btohqsg
i've only done bio but i think research can be veryyy taxing/dull at times but if you like it then you should definitely go for it because it teaches you a Lot beyond the classroom like application-wise etc also you make friends yay,btohqsg
3H2 people can take 2H3s without appeal I think,btohqsg
Well  you can always appeal for 2H3,btohqsg
If you get 4H2 A for promos they‚Äôll even approve,btohqsg
Did u do nrp or astar,btohqsg
Ooooh same I want to take astar,btohqsg
It's once a week on normal school days rite,btohqsg
What do you hope to get out of H3,btohqsg
Independent work. Push button. Record data. Write skeleton of a scientific report. Present.,btohqsg
I hope to do research when I graduate,btohqsg
Nobody has any interests in the subjects  they have a lot of interest in repeating algorithms when presented with 'questions.' The 'questions' are but simple inputs to the hashmaps that make up the top scorers' brains - and the they simply just retrieve and execute the value that the inputs map to.,btohqsg
Research being not guaranteed to succeed does not mean anything  unless you desperately need a H3 Research DIST which is unlikely from negative results,btohqsg
Are you sure? Research in what? What level? How high do you hope to climb? AP in X years? Have you experienced research? Conferences?,btohqsg
That's why I want to do h3 research,btohqsg
Sounds good enough  so you want encouragement here or discouragement here?,btohqsg
Cos of the small number of ppl taking across the cohort  I have few feedbacks from seniors regarding research  would appreciate if anyone could share their experience,btohqsg
This is the general gist of what you need to do.As for experience  well  it depends on your mentor in the end. Generally you'll be extremely challenged as just about everything is out of syllabus and you might not even have the slightest requisite knowledge to even talk about what you are doing  much less 'research' and do something typically no one or little people have done before,btohqsg
You get at least a basic sense of what is research - a lot of weekends get burnt for H3  though normal research you'd just be doing on weekdays,btohqsg
I believe it's once a week and full time during holidays,btohqsg
Of the many reports I've seen  and the report I personally submitted  I'd say 95% are terrible (MERIT or lower) - with a magical few 5% who show extreme potential. I deduce this as my mentor showed me many examples of past project reports  much of which I can't remember but I can remember that there were a few who you just wonder how they can produce such quality work,btohqsg
That once a week you either squeeze after school or weekend.,btohqsg
I suppose this in itself is humbling and important - you need to accept that while you may use and build on e.g. Terence Tao's work  you likely won't even come close to what he has achieved and new breakthroughs he has made. This applies to all famous researchers (Einstein  a few multi-Nobel awardees  etc.),btohqsg
I‚Äôd spam 4 POIs every minute,btohqsg
The point is  you do research even if it gets slow and boring. You need to do good research perhaps exactly to make sure no one ever does what you did - they need only build upon it.,btohqsg
How do people know I block them on tele,btohqsg

Anyone interested to take my notes from 2019 o level   pm :),btohqsg
I have been rejected by every cca I applied for,btohqsg
On the other hand you have rejected every cca you didn‚Äôt apply for,btohqsg
did you go for sports cca,btohqsg
Free dogs to play with u if u run ard,btohqsg
Bate as a suffix sounds nasty,btohqsg
what's so good about Ava lol,btohqsg
ntg much but btr than having no cca,btohqsg
i hate the people but i love what i do,btohqsg
You can go DB whenever you want,btohqsg
how tf do u not have any,btohqsg
I planning go biz since I got friends there,btohqsg
join biz club every valentines day help sell roses,btohqsg
if i had another choice id have gone interact,btohqsg
but they fucking reject me so,btohqsg
if rly ava all that reject u as well  then maybe u wanna consider drama,btohqsg
or just dont join a cca  start ur own SIG,btohqsg
thr are many options to consider  and if u rly end up not having a cca  then hope ur rank points damn good can go anywhr u want,btohqsg
more importantly is grades and potential,btohqsg
you can have no cca but if you have good grades and show initiative buy doing other stuff on the side it‚Äôll look good on you,btohqsg
dont even have to be something big  if you code your own program to help people it already looks better than being in a cca,btohqsg
saying this as someone who had 3 ccas in sec sch and jc,btohqsg
"correct. the impact of the thing you do in your after-school time is more important than the CCA and ""achievement"" you attain in it.",btohqsg
who wanna take a break tomorrow afternoon by playing basketball?,btohqsg
bitcoin is everywhere. always PM me to scam me,btohqsg
needs to work both ways. they earn from some of us. we earn from them too,btohqsg
CCA is a good framework to allow people to have something to invest their time in but it's not the end all. üòó,btohqsg
For most people yes for some people no,btohqsg
Depends  local Uni admissions nah but most higher tier scholarships and overseas uni it(or its equivalent) does,btohqsg
For the avg person it doesnt mattee,btohqsg
More like resume padding with pointless junk,btohqsg
Or as long as u arent aiming for high tier gov scholarships,btohqsg
Well  in another perspective  it's community building; Ppl with similar interests flock together,btohqsg
Well  it keeps u sane from all the academics üò¨,btohqsg
Also mfw people go into ccas for pragmatic reasons rather than genuine interest,btohqsg
Oldham is now d i g i t a l,btohqsg
yes 2-3 minute speeches or something,btohqsg

I am insidious in the circuit -evil laughs-but nobody gives a damn about me -sad face-,btohqsg
our speeches only 8 minute long and they are public,btohqsg
Public but who goes to see,btohqsg
yea i went in and downloaded but can‚Äôt open it on both phone and com,btohqsg
Lol it's just a text file actually,btohqsg
If you want it to look nice you might want to check OpenCerts Viewer by GovTech,btohqsg
The OpenCerts viewer should work for both O/A-level certs,btohqsg
It doesn't work for some certs,btohqsg
By the way  any autonomous university graduates here can help me verify if the OpenCerts viewer can view your degree certificate?,btohqsg
This is just the verifier  the viewer is a separate thing,btohqsg
"The verifier essentially says ""Yes Tan Ah Kow did graduate from Ah Kong School of Taiji""",btohqsg
hi by chance anyone here know how to to revoke blocking of debit card,btohqsg
To my knowledge you can‚Äôt reverse it,btohqsg
basically I tot I lost my debit card outside so I blocked my card and asked for a replacement,btohqsg
replacement will only be mailed to be in 3-5 business days shit,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why they will always ask if you are sure,btohqsg
huh can arrange for alternative collection mode meh,btohqsg
i rmb reporting loss of card thru phone and replacement over counter,btohqsg
I did it thru the app,btohqsg
weird why did it share the reddit page,btohqsg

you can just sell it as being number 1 in the number of break days also,btohqsg
tbh 1 day from the student perspective is good  sch can probably let that day slide  2 weeks def will have e-learning  no sch = have sch  no point,btohqsg

I thought i told the entire SGExams my combi b4 HAHA,btohqsg
I must have not been there for it,btohqsg
question why are there so many indian/pakistani students in the other grp lmao,btohqsg
im thinking maybe they google a level group,btohqsg
and because we don't say it's singapore a level,btohqsg
maybe I fucked up the combot settings and it's public in combot rankings,btohqsg
was gna say we too smart for as levels HAHA,btohqsg

does anyone know how fast will it take for someone being discharged from NS while in service ?,btohqsg
depends on what you‚Äôre being discharged for,btohqsg

But I might be wrong idk,btohqsg
depends how fast your S1/G1 do their job,btohqsg
my friend got a 60 day MC,btohqsg
you‚Äôll be surprised the amount of MCs the S1 branch has to process everyday,btohqsg
did anyone do plastic surgery before ?,btohqsg
i have no idea how he get it. LOL,btohqsg
OK nvm what I said earlier,btohqsg
ok i think i get it 0 is the index position of the object in the bracket after format and 8 or 9 is minimum character thing with padding (please correct me if im wrong danke),btohqsg
I wonder why 8 or 9 tho,btohqsg
Hmm it's the newer string formatting method right just learning format in case i encounter it in someone else code,btohqsg
*gets seizure due to the Py2-style c0de*,btohqsg
Ooo python 2 is the one that uses .format ?,btohqsg
Not really but f-strings were added in Py 3.6,btohqsg
Yeaa and % is the older one rite,btohqsg
Avoid old-style code like the plague pls,btohqsg
Hmm is it safe for me to learn python 3 now,btohqsg
What do you mean by 'safe',btohqsg
Pls no learn c0ding cuz eberiwan is doing it,btohqsg
It is useful if it is useful,btohqsg
It is not useful if it is not useful,btohqsg
For Python to be useful you need to find AT LEAST ONE use-case for it. There are metric tons of use cases  but nobody in the world knows what's your usecase.,btohqsg
In general you don't even need Py  but it is easier,btohqsg
Not sure yet I just started out,btohqsg
A simple example is perhaps you have a Windows Directory of 993 images  and you want to rename all images by their 'date modified' metadata,btohqsg
Then Python 3 is useful. (You could probably also BATCH script it but I wouldn't recommend it),btohqsg
A more typical moolah example is you want to mish mash statistics out from datasets ('data scientist') - Any number of tools will work and Python is just one of them,btohqsg
Anyway AFAIK NUS many engin/sci programmes all have introductory computiong modules  so there's also that. For beginners I'd recommend Python (as compared to Esolangs  C or even just Arduinos),btohqsg
I see I don't plan go nus tho my rp too low,btohqsg
I only mentioned NUS  but IDK about other unis/courses,btohqsg
I'd basically expect most engin/sci courses to at least include it,btohqsg
It's ok  you'll need to learn C anyway later on,btohqsg
Well here's hoping I don't forget it,btohqsg
All your low level nonsense like operating systems and assembly C is useful cause asm is almost 1:1 conversion,btohqsg
System.out.println(‚ÄúI am so done with life.‚Äù),btohqsg
i joined this grpchat cus im bored,btohqsg

Hhaha idc I not taking sprog anymore,btohqsg
The sea is the worlds largest carbon sink so why not,btohqsg
my assignment requires me to look at x86 asm without me ever learning x86,btohqsg
just inhale carbon dioxide and die of carbon dioxide poisoning :D,btohqsg
I have no idea what that is but ok :D,btohqsg
hmm how about suffocation at 40000ft above sea level,btohqsg
Fly an A380 full of passengers  climb and maintain 40000ft  depressurise the aircraft and everyone fucking dies,btohqsg
My exam is in 5 hours and I still know nothing about my module,btohqsg
Time to not have potential to succeed in life,btohqsg
the aircraft then runs out of fuel and plummets to the ground,btohqsg
by that time everyone die already,btohqsg
I will let my friends in syfc know that you should be banned from all flights,btohqsg
That‚Äôs where you get ur license as a youth (which u still are) also  ppl from cass go to syfc sometimes so the news will spread easily >_>,btohqsg
but CAAS stops u from flying the plane,btohqsg
I doubt so  usually ur heart will get the monoxide first so you will probably feel immense chest pain before ur heart stops,btohqsg
Then ur brain will still be working for a while (the thing that causes you to feel pain),btohqsg
There is no such thing as a painless death because you will always cause pain in others,btohqsg
also me: injects liquid carbon monoxide into brain,btohqsg
Sure  or u know  just jump off a y‚Äôall building and go down head first,btohqsg
Where are all the RI people at,btohqsg
An instant of pain compared to a slow  cell reliant death? yeah  I choose the tall building,btohqsg
u also get the thrill of bungee jumping too,btohqsg

Unless u r a nugget or paralyzed from the neck down I doubt that‚Äôs true,btohqsg
if i am a nugget what r u,btohqsg
Do u even know what a nugget is,btohqsg
No  I‚Äôm referring to human nugget,btohqsg
A person with no arms or legs,btohqsg
id rather be a nugget with limbs,btohqsg
i wonder how nick vuijcic lives his life as a limbless kid,btohqsg
I doubt he‚Äôs a kid anymore,btohqsg
when he was a k i d,btohqsg
So you meant ‚Äúlived‚Äù not ‚Äúlives‚Äù?,btohqsg
i know my grammar is bad oke,btohqsg
i live on the 12th floor,btohqsg
How is this relevant  good sir?,btohqsg
the place that i used to live in was in the 25th level  it has two floors so just imagine,btohqsg
whats the average age grp here,btohqsg
because clearly  the boomers are soo good at raising kids,btohqsg
im not legal age yet :/,btohqsg
technically you are  just not in all ways,btohqsg
where yall planning to go after sec sch or whatever sch,btohqsg
you can't drink but you can have sex,btohqsg
"Just wtf  calling people with no limbs ""nuggets"" is fucking derogatory",btohqsg
you won't even want to know how i learnt that that was the term used for them,btohqsg
i learnt it from the term nugget porn  while my friends and i were having a very nsfw coversation,btohqsg
but just because the porn industry uses it does not make it ok to use it,btohqsg
this convo is not suited to this caht group,btohqsg
yall too young for this shit where ur parents,btohqsg
I implore you to stop using the term nuggets to describe limbless people thank you,btohqsg
well  people still call women sluts and bitches >_>,btohqsg
2 wrongs aint make 1 right <_<,btohqsg
i wonder why they dint stop,btohqsg
not all of us are 13  chill,btohqsg
yes  i understand what you mean. however I don't really believe that all things are purely right or wrong,btohqsg
