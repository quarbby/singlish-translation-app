Can it block off a saab?,btohqsg
will the Jc girl survive if she sit in a Volvo not Kia?,btohqsg
Don’t see saab cars on roads often. How come ah,btohqsg
completely different from the previous models.. driven R107 up to R230  this current generation of SL43 feels unrefined and lazy. Slapping on 2 big screens and calling it a day is just sad… nothing compared to historical german over-engineering. And owners have complained about issues with the transmission  gearbox and electrical stuff… might have to call this German Unreliable Engineering,btohqsg
for that money  wld definitely choose stuttgart’s 911 over the SL43,btohqsg
No offense bro but this qn really needee?,btohqsg
The pricing on this car is absolutely atrocious for what you are getting. This thing is a tough sell even at 2/3 the list price,btohqsg
@seeker970he look down on Kia isit 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg

Bro the dummy died on the spot,btohqsg
Just another typical Merc driver finding excuses for the irresponsible act,btohqsg
Speed up to tell the other driver to slow down.😂 new technique,btohqsg
Is not new technique is very common for driver to do that to prevent other from cutting in his lane  just very suey he met this saab driver. Instead of slowing down he rammed it through.  We can speculate what if the merc didn’t speed up etc but as a seasoned driver you damm know when someone pulling away and have no intention to slow down  your immediate and logical action is to slow down wait for safe opening.,btohqsg

Buy Cat A tune to Cat B 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Have you ever exited from expressway? Have you encountered people speed up to close gap from cue cutter ? Is a common move  what spurred the merc do is yes big ego when you have the whole lane for u and nothing infront. The question here is the judgement of the saab driver  common sense u see people pull away not giving way; u slow down and hit brake just like everytime u want to exit expressway cutting to the left  same technique here apply,btohqsg
i believe they think their car is faster coz got high hp,btohqsg
i encounter a few times  mainly BBA,btohqsg
BBA cut across expect people to give way,btohqsg
when their turn they just step on accelerator to show they are faster,btohqsg

Yes some mod abit thought is racing car liao🤣,btohqsg
i got chance when i using old car like proton/perodua i sure bang them,btohqsg
Why ah bro curious ? I thought if you rammed someone from behind is your fault ?,btohqsg
I mean the people who hit you*,btohqsg
no  under the rules  if u cut out from your lane,btohqsg
its your fault when the other car hit u from behind,btohqsg
i checked already with different parties,btohqsg
so if u come from behind someone trying to cut out from his lane,btohqsg
You got see Maserati   Ferrari or any of the supercar drive such way ? Usually people auto give way to them,btohqsg
I see  even with enough safe distance? No chance to argue ?,btohqsg
u bang into him its his fault,btohqsg
