Hi  would like to ask  in this climate of high COE  will going for a new car or secondhand car makes more sense ? I have heard dealers selling to me based on the theory of “getting a brand new car now  then sell it 1-2 years later for another higher end car”..Is this true ?,btohqsg
first 3 years your new car depreciate the most,btohqsg
let others tank the depreciation and buy a 3 year old car la,btohqsg
Honestly we can’t answer for you,btohqsg
Actually depends on the new car what car,btohqsg
If you buy type r confirm can profit one,btohqsg
Hmmm why do you say so ?,btohqsg
I am looking at a SUV.. the likes of Volkswagen T cross/ Audi q3,btohqsg
I got a Note and selling it now would give me some small profit of few K. Thinking to buy into T cross  dealer also mentioned that I can buy a T cross now and then upgrade to Q3 1-2 years later.. not too sure if they are right or am I being smoked ?,btohqsg
just buy Q3 now? you switch 1 car in between still lose value when you trade in or sell,btohqsg
just decide on a model and stick with it...,btohqsg
wish we have the T-Roc in Singapore,btohqsg
Just curious why would it lose value if one were to switch 1 car in between ?,btohqsg
out of curiousity were you speaking to the sales at VW?,btohqsg
of course they will tell you to buy a T-cross,btohqsg
trade in = lose money  early redemption of loan = lose money  new car taxes = lose money,btohqsg
buy new car and don't drive for 5 years = lose money,btohqsg
buy car in singapore immediately lose money,btohqsg
best is take bus mrt and walk,btohqsg
Yes I am! They seems to be selling T cross a lot,btohqsg
