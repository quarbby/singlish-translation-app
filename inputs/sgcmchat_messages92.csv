At least not the old 4G13 from Mirage. My South Korea mech friend last time had lot of problem with that engine..,btohqsg
Peep the shitty Tesla in the background,btohqsg
it‚Äôs ok he‚Äôs never been in one before,btohqsg
he doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs saying,btohqsg
why do people hate on Tesla's,btohqsg
because they just hop on every trend,btohqsg
They are quick of the line but shit at the top end,btohqsg
i thought people hated tesla cause its electric,btohqsg
experience the 0-60 of a model s my friend,btohqsg
‚Äúshit build quality‚Äù is also not true,btohqsg
whats the point? sg still gna be covered with EVs sooner or later,btohqsg
but why hate tesla my friend,btohqsg
I feel like Elon boosted the evs to become more popular,btohqsg
And look at his sons fucking name,btohqsg
no link with tesla being shit,btohqsg
no one is talking about his sons name,btohqsg
Youre in the front seat of a phv,btohqsg
some people js hate on cars for no reason,btohqsg
i will pick a tesla until a stock mustang can manage to beat my mom,btohqsg
I'd pick a Ioniq Electric than a Tesla thank you very much,btohqsg
i will also pick a tesla until a taycan can improve their 0-60 for their price,btohqsg
the ioniq is a good car but the self driving and charging network is bigger for tesla,btohqsg
what's the point of this photo also tho js curious,btohqsg
we‚Äôve owned all 4 tesla models and they are all amazing,btohqsg
do some research before a shitty assumption,btohqsg
build quality was never an issue across all 4 my friend,btohqsg
my only hate against tesla is their lack of physical buttons and the fact that we placed a deposit for the cybertruck 4 years ago and still never got it,btohqsg
I'd stick to Hyundai for EVs  thanks.,btohqsg
sure i‚Äôll enjoy gapping you guys,btohqsg
I'll see you crash first then üòÇ,btohqsg
that‚Äôs the driver problem my friend,btohqsg
but of course we could always use autopilot,btohqsg
@doziinwhat car isit in your pfp,btohqsg
which is still the best on the market,btohqsg
U have mode y and 997?,btohqsg
ey at least you don‚Äôt break down,btohqsg
we left the car there overnight,btohqsg
some random carpark near ipan house,btohqsg
just nice got tp behind us when the car spoil,btohqsg
he ask everyone get out the car,btohqsg
then we js chill with the officer,btohqsg
He got ask push the car?,btohqsg
we held up traffic for 10mins,btohqsg
cos its the entrance to the expressway,btohqsg
so u guys were the reason of jam...,btohqsg
low cost manufacturing and they ‚Äúhop on‚Äù some retarded saving the earth trend,btohqsg
funny cos diesel are more environmentally then ur shitty built fking mrt looking mobile,btohqsg
The Model S made in the US are fucking shit. Even the russians have better QC,btohqsg
Nope  like all Tesla's  promises made an never kept,btohqsg
dont talk shit if u arent even legal to have sex.,btohqsg
Can gap is can gap ah but enjoy waiting 20mins for full charge,btohqsg
Do you even have a driving license bro?,btohqsg
Because they're just good tech products  not good cars.,btohqsg
In a base spec c4 ? I think in a S maybe,btohqsg
‚Äúeh‚Äù is a overstatement. the build quality is absolutely trash. i rather drive a fucking lawn mower to school,btohqsg
Sure  because can't drive yourself can you?,btohqsg
are you that fucking degenerate u must use autopilot?,btohqsg
autopilot is a choice my friend,btohqsg
gotta use those drivers assists boi,btohqsg
A Lada fking riva has better build,btohqsg
Tell that to tp when they stop you,btohqsg
but not approve in sg leh?,btohqsg
Well  you don't even get full fsd here in Singapore so what you flexing my guy,btohqsg
Basically get lane keep assist and adaptive cruise control at best,btohqsg
u can get those in a kia nowadays,btohqsg
Bang into the wall and the wall break eh? ü§£,btohqsg
And it won't kill your only screen as you're driving giving you no view of lights  speed or controls,btohqsg
Oh and if the car dies and you're stranded,btohqsg
You try to open the door and the window will just shatter in your face,btohqsg
Straight up.. you're fucked* unless you have a generator in the boot,btohqsg
Hyundai fking easy to get stolen,btohqsg
My cherry qq oso build bttr than a Tesla,btohqsg
Like Hyundai is great and all,btohqsg
Mostly the report kena US le,btohqsg
Yahla cos there most crime la,btohqsg
Only idiots come and steal a car in Singapore,btohqsg
Oh and I'm not talking about dying cause no battery  I'm referring to dying because of glitches and failures with the 12v battery which aren't uncommon,btohqsg
I legit dun get why ppl dl Tesla Sia,btohqsg
"I think BYD still make better than the ""Made in China"" Tesla ehh..",btohqsg
There are bttr options out there,btohqsg
Well the way Hyundai's are stolen  you can steal any car the same way using keyless rfid cloners. Just that we hear more about Hyundai's and kias being stolen in Malaysia because they are easy and faster to move as a stolen car and there's a bigger market for parts,btohqsg
u pay so much in sg for dogshit build quality,btohqsg
Honestly I dun see anyth wrong w it,btohqsg
i‚Äôve seen nissan latios with better build quality,btohqsg
My car taste is damn bad,btohqsg
u pay how many hundred thousand,btohqsg
ur interior panels so fucking flimsy,btohqsg
Very simple.. Don't just have a one-track mind. If EV only think of Tesla.. pukimak got other options and cheaper options see with open eyes lah dei!,btohqsg
Idk la my car taste is q ass,btohqsg
Ok next time you have a chance,btohqsg
eh where is the 997 dude,btohqsg
some countries r js not ideal for tesla,btohqsg
flex his laopeh car then disappear,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt love the car but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a bad car,btohqsg
I think he cry to his dad and order C4S badge on shopee to upbadge,btohqsg
talking about self driving tesla is full autopilot even released in sg?,btohqsg
where the dude that say he use autopilot,btohqsg
Dun say bro later he flex his Porsche,btohqsg
Y'all got see the Cullinan on FOS?,btohqsg
I q like the Taycan tho,btohqsg
Taycans are arguably the best driving ev out there,btohqsg
I would take a Camry over a Pagani,btohqsg
Not a fan of the sport design kit,btohqsg
But the GTS bumper looks good,btohqsg
Well at least you don't have to worry about the car breaking down,btohqsg
If ur broke jus say that,btohqsg
I want to point out something stupid also ah..,btohqsg
4s sport Turismo is the sweet spot,btohqsg
Dude but like the pagani so unpractical,btohqsg
I mean when you buy a pagani,btohqsg
You don't buy it as your daily,btohqsg
Paganis are a sign of wealth,btohqsg
Y'all know even the EV applies to motorcycles right..? Some MSCP now have 1 or 2 E-motorcycle lots which is cfm gonna be empty..,btohqsg
Idk ah I‚Äôm not a big fan,btohqsg
no bro tesla is the best,btohqsg
i can laugh at other peasants,btohqsg
Ok wait not Camry over pagani,btohqsg
If I had 10 million dollars,btohqsg
And put the rest into something more feasible,btohqsg
Yupp  tbh ev scooters and motorcycles make a lot of sense,btohqsg
If I had 10 million dollars,btohqsg
U would buy a Tesla and a 997,btohqsg
people drive their own car but i must shove my dads car in their face and ask them enjoy their own car,btohqsg
Ironic thing is I‚Äôm using my dads car to tell someone to enjoy a car that they actually paid for,btohqsg
Bro.. only around 200km per charge but then no space to put belongings.. cus underseat used for batteries and if put box then range become lower,btohqsg
Ok the scooters actually quite good,btohqsg
Got a lot nice ones coming up,btohqsg
No to the Tesla but yes to the 997,btohqsg
They designing them with swappable batteries,btohqsg
But Singapore sadly no good ev 2 wheelers,btohqsg
Outside got a lot of nice ones,btohqsg
The range change not much different when put box bro,btohqsg
If can i'd get the turbo 997.. before adding a rwb kit.,btohqsg
When put more load range go down.,btohqsg
Not that much of difference in practical use,btohqsg
Do I look like I give a fuck about the purists?,btohqsg
When can be done legally  do ah.,btohqsg
Ice also same put more weight  fc go up,btohqsg
