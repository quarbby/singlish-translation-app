Suggest the major product formed when phenol reacts with ClCOCH2CH2COCl and AlCl3 (2 tsp),btohqsg

@jianjun21how is the bellcurve for your courses ? Is it ridiculously high like 90% and above for everything just to get A-,btohqsg
Every course is equally steep  aside from engineering,btohqsg
It depends on the difficulty of the mod also. If every1 does badly  the cut off to get A- and above decreases. If every1 does well  the cut off to get A- and above consequently increases.,btohqsg
I got 90% for a mod and got an A.Another mod i got probably about 85-86% and it was an A+.,btohqsg
I'm trying to find notes for hook and eye stories from the margin but apparently my school is bastard and picked a book which has no history. . .,btohqsg

Wait guys is mtl only for 1 year for jc,btohqsg
im sec 4 this year but how can i take h3 subjects when i go jc,btohqsg
different sch different requirement haha I aso not sure,btohqsg
Do well in J1 promos and meet whatever requirements the JC sets,btohqsg
Then they'll invite u/u request to take H3,btohqsg
The requirements can be pretty flexible  it's up to the H3 in charge teacher to take u or not,btohqsg
