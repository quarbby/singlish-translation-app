Maybe a lot of people panicked,btohqsg
OK it means indeed they have issue.,btohqsg
Setup from hsbc internet banking or mobile app?,btohqsg
Website  their mobile app is incredibly basic. You have to send them a secure message though  it‚Äôs not a setting. There should be a basic template to fill in for alerts after you select what kind of message you would like to send them.,btohqsg
I think I saw that in the mobile app  you can freeze your cards. Do try !,btohqsg
I lock my cards after use. When I need to use  then I enable,btohqsg
Duno if they're system got loops holed,btohqsg
Probably someone pressed the wrong button while testing,btohqsg

hihi  wish to check if theres 10X Rewards for normal taxi?,btohqsg
hi gurus  for ocbc 90N card do we get reward from public transport ?,btohqsg
Hi  would like to check credit payment for electric services under Senoko via their app is it consider as online spending ?Thinking of using UOB EVOL or UOB One Card.,btohqsg
Anyone has data points on Yuu card with Singtel bills yet? (Paid via online recurring),btohqsg
I think Utilities are excluded for UOB EVOL.,btohqsg
Ok thanks but under UOB One Card is an eligible spend right ?,btohqsg
Senoko Energy just like SP Services (same category as Senoko Energy) should be an eligible spend under utilities.,btohqsg
Hi experts  do you think using UOB Evol overseas is worth it? In a sense  since its effective cashback is 6.67%  and the fx fees arnd 3-3.5%. There are still some net gains right?,btohqsg
theoretically yes  but the UOB Evol window is quite tight.Min spend $600  cap at $20 for contactless which is effectively $250 spend @ 8%.I assume your regular monthly spend probably already hits that since you are using that card.So if you use up the cashback cap on your trip  your regular contactless spend in SG on that month can't enjoy this cashback.Probably better off using youtrip/trust/etc.Lastly  remember that UOB Evol has a '8%' cashback  effectively its lower because OPTIMALLY  you spend exactly $600.With at least $250 in online and contactless respectively.That gives you $40.3 cashback with $600 spend  effectively ~6.717% cashback which drops the more you spend past it.,btohqsg
sorry to add context is also because I'll be away from sg for almost a year  and if I can't hit the min. spend then I guess I need to forgot the UOB account as well... hahaha,btohqsg
maybe any other savings account recommended?,btohqsg
Assuming you want no risk no frills HYSA maybe  like HSBC EGA. tho might need to SMS every 4 months to activate promo rates assuming it continues.Or t-bills/fixed deposit etc if you don't need to touch and don't want to bother with it.,btohqsg
Hi everyone For miles card is HSBC revolution better or citi rewards linked to amaze? Mostly for online spending and bills,btohqsg
Depends on whether it‚Äôs in SGD(either) or USD(CRxAmaze).,btohqsg
Is the bonus 1% for saving with trust bank automatically given if you are a union member?,btohqsg
Is it possible to get Amaze points by linking Amaze with Youtrip card?,btohqsg
Dun think possible. Sorry  may I understand the rationale?,btohqsg
It should be possible..but why you want to do this?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if topping up revolut card by Amex will have 1.5% cashback?,btohqsg
If top up by SCB card  will we have some cash back?,btohqsg
no card give cashback for topup of revolut,btohqsg
I think the simple ans is a yes. But I dun know what's the min spend. I have the UOB One card pair with my UOB One account. I have been able to request annual fees waiver successfully.,btohqsg
If I buy Fullerton cash fund via tiger broker  when will be filled?,btohqsg

Just to clarify since The payment is via Apple Pay  would that goes into contactless or online transaction,btohqsg
Hi everyone  just like to check if I have a citi bank cash back credit card and I apply for another citibank rewards card through singsaver will I be entitled to the free gift/promotion?,btohqsg
Only if there is a promo available for existing cardholders,btohqsg

Hi admin Is there foreigners (S PASS) holders eligible for credit card in SG...,btohqsg
Hi  I want to sign up for yuu card. I have a DBS everyday debit card  so am I considered as a new card member or existing customer ?,btohqsg
