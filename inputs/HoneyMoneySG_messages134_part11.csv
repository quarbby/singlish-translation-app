Hi guys. Any one knows if travel book ontrip.comcount towards the DBS altitude promo? Thanksss,btohqsg
Hi gurus can I use Kris+ and UOB PPV and would it count as mobile contactless or is it better I use UOB KF with Kris+. I am trying to purchase in harvey norman,btohqsg
kris+ is online. Assuming mcc 5732  should still get 4mpd on uob ppv,btohqsg
Hi guys  I am quite confused with Agoda booking...I am planning to book Malaysia AgodaWill I be charged RM or SGD?what is the best card to use for cashback?,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
For which cashback card to use  you can check heymax.Sgd vs myr  it depends you pay now or pay later.,btohqsg
I am going to pay now  because pay later is more expensiveSo that would be SGD or MYR?,btohqsg
From your previous post  I will be charged a dcc right? No way to avoid this?I am going to book a Malaysia hotel  pay now  and use OCBC frankIs there a better way for cashback?,btohqsg
Ocbc frank is visa card right? Then it wont get dcc cuz agoda visa payment gateway is in Singapore. Only master card kenna,btohqsg
I compared 8 Multi-Currency Cards for the Best Exchange Ratehttps://youtu.be/o8o_oSn9YPw,btohqsg
Why is no one talking about ichange recently? Used to be giving the best rates some time back,btohqsg
1) unstable when use at POS2) cannot top up ewallet,btohqsg
I was using it in Korea just 6 months back. Was a smooth experience then,btohqsg
Anybody know which cards has the lowest charge or best rebate to pay for Taobao purchase. Now using normal credit card is about 3% charge.,btohqsg
Hi yall  isit suggested to put into MA account first or SA?bcos MA can supercharge the CPF %.but for SA  might have issues with tax relief in future   but technicallt we can turn to SRS still right ?,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if i deposit 200K in ocbc  fulfil salary  $500 credit card spend  maintain $200k  I would get 2.5%+0.6%+2.4%=5.5%?,btohqsg
Most the interests are only for first 100k btw,btohqsg
Err ok. The website misleading.  So the best place to park is still uob one $150k. Any other place recommended for any amount above $150k?I see gxs 3months 3.48%. Thats probably the next best I find.,btohqsg
Ever since closure of SA at 55  both ways are fairly the same. MA first if you want to supercharge your CPF but you'll lose potential tax reliefs. SA first but to have overall more tax reliefs but like you said  can still turn to SRS for tax reliefs.,btohqsg
Website not misleading. It is very clearly stated that what bonus interest is being applied for how much.,btohqsg
Ys there is a calculator on the website too fr u to use :),btohqsg
Hi experts  does anyone know when will UOB one cc‚Äôs cashback come in? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Following statement month after the statement quarter.,btohqsg
GXS 3 mths has been cut to 3.28%.,btohqsg
I wonder how long Ocbc will hold out,btohqsg
I just watch the videoBasically what Chris did was that he top up a touch n go and grab.What was tested ismulti currency card.,btohqsg
Anybody knows which electricity retailer has the best sign up promotion? My contract ending soon,btohqsg
Hi gurus  may I know for OCBC spent bonus  is it statement month or calendar month?,btohqsg
Hihi  is it worth it to pay SP utility bill using UOB uni$? Or should I keep it to pay convert to travel miles.‚Äúredeem UNI$500 (S$5) for every S$10 of bill payment‚Äù,btohqsg
Are you intending to use uni$ to transfer to miles?,btohqsg
Yes!But I saw the SP bill can redeem uni$500 ($5) for every $10 bill as well. But I‚Äôm thinking if it‚Äôs worth it.Else will just transfer my Uni$ to air miles,btohqsg
500uni$ is 1000 miles then you work out it's worth it anot. For my own value of miles  it's not.,btohqsg
Maybank visa platinum still a worth it ?If after max 500 uob 500 ocbc wanna spend on Maybank visa platinum for the remaining,btohqsg
Any exclusiion I Ned to remember for Maybank Visa platinum,btohqsg
see the TnC for the exclusions,btohqsg
I would suggest you double down on UOB One instead since it has a bonus component for Mac Donalds  Grab and Dairy farm group.Once you max UOB One  maybe can try Maybank VP for the standard 3.33%.,btohqsg
When I topup YouTrip with Mastercard cc linked to HSBC EGA giro for payment  will that get me 1% cash back? üòÖ,btohqsg
Ya not into fast food grab,btohqsg
It‚Äôs cool. Just that one got bonus and the other don‚Äôt have. If you do $1k still same 3.33% plus incidentals at Cold Storage  Giant  BreadTalk etc sort of tips it into the UOB One for me.,btohqsg
Ya now mostly on uob one and ocbcUob one 500Ocbc over 1k sometimeBut sometime lowerSo maybe want spread outUnless theie is other card without min spending sum,btohqsg
Can I get some recommendation. What platform should I use if I want to invest in STI ETF on RSP and I want the dividends to just reinvest without any manual intervention.,btohqsg
Always spill into UOB One instead of OCBC unless 365.You can consider Amaze+CRMC for no minimum. Effective cash back is 2.27% from it or 4 miles per dollar  flexible.Amaze+CRMC better make hay while sun shines in case Citibank starts excluding Amaze as well.,btohqsg
Ya don't have Citi but hmm if less then 1k sometime I think risky on uob one,btohqsg
That why the Maybank visa $300 min sound safer,btohqsg
Actually having a general spend card with no minimums is not a bad idea rather than adopting another one with a min spend. You do give up 1.06% on it but it allows you flexibility to save more or invest if you want to üòä,btohqsg
Hi  any recommendation for high interest savings account without salary crediting?,btohqsg
Hi..I paid Singtel bill with Singtel app using YUU card. Is it quality as bonus points earning?,btohqsg
