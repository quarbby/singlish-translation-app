isnâ€™t it js like 26 points?,btohqsg
do uk who i was up against in my eae?,btohqsg
Which in this case is less than 26 pts and pass C6 Maths Science +D7 English,btohqsg
Diff course also got diff minimum,btohqsg
As I said. EAE is the most low stakes shit ever,btohqsg
Btw if u think this then u arent ready for eae,btohqsg
i lowkey felt i shld hav applied for a less competitive course,btohqsg
Im not throwing shit at u but like serious,btohqsg
u stood no chance if that's all u got,btohqsg
Limpeh do before it's legit nothing lmao,btohqsg
eh that one o level what,btohqsg
Olevel ITE it's the same shit bruh u do the same test and interviews etc.,btohqsg
your mentality needs to be adjusted,btohqsg
It's just a different qualification point,btohqsg
In my interview right the other 3 people were student council presidents  have their own successful biz that is already making 10k/mth and are already helping out in community,btohqsg
i o lvl still going ite,btohqsg
this is who u are up against,btohqsg
u are literally up against elites,btohqsg
ask them stfu and say fun act so big fk,btohqsg
N level EAE requirements is different from O level standards,btohqsg
My interview also but in the end they pick me,btohqsg
Just enter using your results can liao ITE is legit no competition for entry one u hit the requirements u will get in,btohqsg
If u don't hit the requirements even EAE also cannot help u,btohqsg
Imagine needing a failsafe for N levels,btohqsg
Honestly right the interview was actually cutting it close so i think they chose the one with most stacked portfolio,btohqsg
but got alot of weird ppl at ite eae,btohqsg
Which brings me back to my point EAE is the most lowstakes shit ever,btohqsg
make me want drop put ho private,btohqsg
Hearsay those joker mostly Nursing one,btohqsg
The EAE for nursing is damn competitive,btohqsg
Cause pay is decent after grad kek,btohqsg
js go thr act arrogant like u achieve alot can alr,btohqsg
"No la is cuz those ppl legit got ""passion"" for nursing",btohqsg
The JAE intake is for those who fucked up Olevels,btohqsg
then fuck YOUR PASSION bro what is this guy on,btohqsg
Smlj u got see nursing pay before?,btohqsg
but i feel like if uw go nursing  it's better to go jc then do alvls,btohqsg
Wah that girl gone liao we scared her off,btohqsg
cause u have higher chance of getting into nus nursing,btohqsg
and bachelor of nursing pays higher than dip,btohqsg
Depends. But most cases actually dun need,btohqsg
Bachelor allows for Advanced Practice Nurse Progression but it's too specialised,btohqsg
E120 how much u think nursing pays,btohqsg
nus nursing not that competitive act,btohqsg
What we need are regular RNs and ENs,btohqsg
matcha not everyone can get into JC with whatever life experiences considered by the norm,btohqsg
Which the Diploma churns out and pays decent if u hop around,btohqsg
E120 can give me money? I dont wanna work anymore,btohqsg
it's not rlly an eltist mindset,btohqsg
Smlj u buy aespa ticket from scalper u still wanna ask me for money. I still haven't ask you for aespa ticket yet kns,btohqsg
