I want be necklace maker. tbh. 48k sound like good pay.,btohqsg
i feel smart ppl dont always do well,btohqsg
Replication works  but not by copying the answers.Need to replicate the thinking process.It applies for any subject. Or any job.,btohqsg
The idea is that you need to be able to get from step 1 to the ans on your own in the future even if the question changes,btohqsg
Even in my current research we apply that idea,btohqsg
at least can survive by myself.,btohqsg
i learnt more from answer sheets than from school notes,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I always made my own notes in uni,btohqsg
Notes are there to introduce you to the topic and the basic applications. Not really possible to go in depth too much.That's not the objective.,btohqsg
where I noted down my own interpretations  etc,btohqsg
That's why textbooks are good for introducing a new subject/topic/concept.But to do well  it's another approach.,btohqsg
or how I go about understanding smth,btohqsg
the power of active revision üëç,btohqsg
Yea it‚Äôs not like I just copy stuff from the textbook and expect it to stick. I go through concept by concept  think through it  make sure I get it and then write it down in a way that makes sense to me,btohqsg
yeah your brain cant remember HAYDFQWIEFHBVWALF,btohqsg
i just want to retire and smell the air,btohqsg
if you wanna learn physics then learn lor,btohqsg
But really learning physics involves learning lots of math,btohqsg
but when you imagine for every 10 years  there are 3650 days  and if you eat 3 meals a day  it is 10950 meals.Each meal average $10 with drinks and inflation factored in  one needs $109500 for every 10 years just for meals.,btohqsg
I would love for you to teach me that but now seems a little too late HAHA as sem 1 is ending :'),btohqsg
unless you aim to eat white bread everyday,btohqsg
its pointless that economies are so focused on productivity,btohqsg
like in pursuit of productivity they just go higher and higher,btohqsg
Sometimes CNY spend more per meal. Sometimes celebrations.So give and take average $10 per meal I think is fair,btohqsg
what if in the name of economic growth they use dead bodies and keep them alive to increase productivity,btohqsg
i spent a lot of ns money on food,btohqsg
scarier if you think of it this way:From age 25 to 85  there's 60 years. If prices stay the same as now  you would need ~$660k just for food.And a sufficiently big HDB for 2 adults 2 kids is at least $400k now.So for 2 adults and a HDB and 2 kids (assuming feed for 20 years)  the couple would need to earn about $2.16 million over their working lifetimes.,btohqsg
3k a month x 30 years = $1mil,btohqsg
it should be double that over 60 years,btohqsg
1.03^60 = 5.89 actually. So more than double.,btohqsg
It is interesting if you try that amount into CPF.Most people will actually hit the retirement sum by age 55 if they work all the way.,btohqsg
3k a month is about my stipend lol,btohqsg
replace the 'children expense' with your bills and insurance expense,btohqsg
you know as I look out of my window  I see different type of houses  condo  landed hdb.. just imagine the different type of stories and backgrounds that we have that makes this little community,btohqsg
ok ray we get it you don't want kids but u get no bitches to begin with,btohqsg
In fact  skip the HDB too. Just leech parents can liao mah.,btohqsg
only forever single people can understand other people who will remain single for life. so,btohqsg
I mean it depends cos if it‚Äôs BTO there‚Äôs like HDB loan  but for condo you‚Äôre usually limited to bank loans,btohqsg
then how do you pay back to loan,btohqsg
saw a property agent video on youtube on Malaysia bungalow. Going for $660k ringgit,btohqsg
dunno leh  i only see a bit  skip liao,btohqsg
my grandfather bought his house for 90k ringgit,btohqsg
would you sacrifice benefits in sg and retire in malaysia if have nice house nice food nice car can go vacation and see children just drive to sg,btohqsg
But I know my ex colleague  recently went back Malaysia bought a terrace and a car.And I know by now  his salary and position won't exceed $6k monthly because he still young.,btohqsg
why not bring your sg car there,btohqsg
why not take car to johor then bus in sg,btohqsg
also my mom also says it does take forever,btohqsg
considering how mahatir wants a one msia policy  yea....,btohqsg
you know the countries are developing which means in the far furture they would surpass us by very large margins,btohqsg
like malaysias potential is larger than that of sg,btohqsg
