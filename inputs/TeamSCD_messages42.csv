Those who want I take out alr cash n carry $50.,btohqsg
If he back out I inform again,btohqsg
I legit interested in it how it works,btohqsg
Price is right so yah lor,btohqsg
Actually looking to get the Blitz one but let see how the lufi one first,btohqsg
OBD gauges will be the same one la. Doesn't matter japanese or chinese,btohqsg
As long as can read can alr. Cheap and expensive I think the same,btohqsg
Means no chance of backing out liao 🤣,btohqsg
i using blitz but its air filter,btohqsg
Cause my Greddy also fake de but I think it’s nice still leh,btohqsg
can feel abit better den paper type,btohqsg
Idk if got fit my Mazda 3 not,btohqsg
Shd be can fit ma  make to size one,btohqsg
I thought he say is the cabin air filter,btohqsg
Cabin just use shopee can alr,btohqsg
Cabin i find all the same.. Just maybe some will block more air from ur vent,btohqsg
Does anybody knows what this means?,btohqsg
shit  check engine light also up?,btohqsg
Check brake light is  also on.,btohqsg
But should be safe to drive right?🥲,btohqsg
If it's not safe will go into limp mode,btohqsg
Looks like your Hill start assist needs to be checked.,btohqsg
That inclined photo is hill start assist,btohqsg
Plug obd reader and you'll know what's wrong,btohqsg
since got warranty dunnid waste time,btohqsg
then ask them tow in. Hahahaha,btohqsg
Generally.. Yellow Icons are Warnings  still drivable. Red icons are malfunction and would mean dangerous or unable to drive.,btohqsg
So this case  looks like parking brake is on so got red brake warning so red no factor but also got yellow icon with hill assist warning in the center also got traction/stability control warning so likely got some brake related issue. Can drive but do it slow bah. If don't feel save just tow.,btohqsg
if under warranty should be fine,btohqsg
can always go back and rectify,btohqsg
any cheap workshop gaisiao install steering rack bushing?,btohqsg
Try Kien Cheong at sin ming,btohqsg
not bad quote $85 outside quote $120,btohqsg
Labour can't be helped. Whole front subframe need to come down to change the bushing. I think reasonable alr. If need alignment  they can do side slip.,btohqsg
Some transmisssion switch open now its gone,btohqsg
No more alr so good for now even though it said permanent issue the mechanic say could be cause install new air intake and ask me monitor hopefully nvr pops up again🥲,btohqsg

but once i cruise go down again,btohqsg
yours like the other way round leh. haha,btohqsg
because for BMW they will intentionally let the coolant run hot during cruise to improve thermal efficiency.,btohqsg
Check coolant bro.. had this problem before,btohqsg
In the end coolant hose leak  sensor had issue,btohqsg
during hard driving  then the car will keep the temps lower.,btohqsg
i had the thermostat spring changed to the ftp racing one,btohqsg
then my normal temp was 100deg while cruising,btohqsg
only after ytd i had my v brace wrapped  had the fins behind the grills removed then tdy the car started running cold,btohqsg
by right here gt fins one,btohqsg
i doubt it affect much. just monitor coolant lo,btohqsg
i bought the coloured ones to cup over. didnt wrap 😂,btohqsg
haha the cold engine only started after the fins were removed,btohqsg
Better check. Too cold not good. Too hot not good also,btohqsg
it should affect at what temps do the radiator fans turn on....  On mine its like that  not sure if its the same for bmw,btohqsg
ya there could be a possibility but i was thinking since he only changed the thermostat spring  not sure if it affected the cooling management software. maybe got.,btohqsg
but only started after ytd haha,btohqsg
i used the upgraded springs for 2 mths my temps were at 100,btohqsg
i think best to monitor a while more before going to workshop.,btohqsg
dont forget Friday is a holiday.,btohqsg
Better air flow = lower temp,btohqsg
Seeing this video makes me feel like wanna go nshw clear 1 x good one carbon😂,btohqsg

The depre for every car also went up. But no ppl buy.,btohqsg
but end of the day  its not a GTR,btohqsg
Erm..plenty of businesses in the pre-owned market apparently,btohqsg

if your tyre's are no good  it wont matter what bbk you have,btohqsg
Dun believe? try going to pump Vpower full tank...😂😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
if street use  high temp pads also not necessary. you'll be getting suboptimal braking if they're not in the correct temperature range.,btohqsg
