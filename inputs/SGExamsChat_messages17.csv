You must try to. No offence ah  but I think your type eventually will marry fellow Chinese one. But before you make that commitment  you must try other flavors also. So that you know what it’s like. Scratch the itch you know.,btohqsg
Me too much in career mode,btohqsg
People's preference is their own preference tbh,btohqsg

You do know that lockdown is to prevent outside screwing things up that spill to inside and not salvaging of the inside right?,btohqsg
I clearly didnt know that =0,btohqsg
But i would say is a mix of both tbh,btohqsg
is actrually to prevent inside from affecting outside also,btohqsg
Guys the lockdown is just a mindset change.,btohqsg
Even painting kena corona lockdown sia,btohqsg
Hey guys sorry to bother. Please could someone assit me  does anyone have a pdf version of the igcse accounting book,btohqsg

I cannot allow the xmms to fall into your hands,btohqsg
Ur first account that keeps dying,btohqsg
Hi guys! Can y’all help me out with my cousin’s P6 math question? 🙏🏻,btohqsg
dont wanna spoil the question 😂,btohqsg
but damn I miss fun questions like these,btohqsg
1 unit + 14 = 31?,btohqsg
Models is just algebra drawn out,btohqsg
Wah. Show off pass PSLE math sia. Got ppl fail,btohqsg
I don't even know wtf is a remainder back in pri sch,btohqsg

Remainder is just divide until cannot ma. The balance lydat,btohqsg
Lmao my pri sch ass didn't know how to do,btohqsg
Then you divide everything until zhun zhun?,btohqsg
sqrt(g) = 3 = pi = e = mc^2,btohqsg
Engineers have been celebrating pi day for the whole month,btohqsg
actually pi day is the 0th of march  so only the programmers celebrate it correctly on march 1st  because arrays start from 0,btohqsg
We go back to solve H2 Physics,btohqsg
I feel it's a little bit inaccurate. Missing quantum terms,btohqsg
Modern physics does have a few shakeups though  like regarding luminosity of supernova IIRC,btohqsg
I can’t compress my supporting docs to be 2MB and below AND I TRIED EVERYTHING,btohqsg
how much supporting docs u have LOL,btohqsg
You try print on both sides of pdf to maximize,btohqsg
"try using ""cutepdf"" to create minified pdf file?",btohqsg
not that much tho I didnt put unnecessary stuff,btohqsg
Just certificates of achievements that I mentioned in the essay,btohqsg
let me try this but I have tried everything else omg,btohqsg
It refuses to shrink anymore and I’m losing my sanity,btohqsg
how big is ur original pdf,btohqsg
all the fac give their own merit scholarship,btohqsg
3.6MB after I compressed it the first time,btohqsg
did u take pic in colour,btohqsg
I used the phone app again to change everything to black and white and guess what the file size was BIGGER,btohqsg
Then need to put the admission number and full name at the top right,btohqsg
Lmao try those online website compressors,btohqsg
That makes the file size very big,btohqsg
I think i had to ower dpi also,btohqsg
I used 2 websites to compress and compress and compress it again,btohqsg
My sch trip is on may,btohqsg
It literally refuses to compress anymore kmn😂😂😂,btohqsg
u not gnna get a scholarship,btohqsg
they cutting scholarships across the board this year,btohqsg
also this is really demoralising I DIDNT NEED TO KNOW THIS HAHAHA,btohqsg
The phone scanners is like picture by picture,btohqsg
if u go FASS den fewer scholarships,btohqsg
Don’t leave the other side of pdf blank,btohqsg
if go computing same amt as last year iirc,btohqsg
It's left as an interesting exercise to the reader.,btohqsg
But it’s picture by picture  I can’t choose single side or double side or anything,btohqsg
Got sliders to adjust until just nice 2mb,btohqsg
where did you get this info from pls!! I wanna check,btohqsg
Like the file quality etc ah to get 2mb need to try and error,btohqsg
Scan both sides of the pdf screen. The front and the back,btohqsg
merit scholarships are awarded by faculty,btohqsg
but unless u represent SG very hard to get global merit,btohqsg
what about the other 2 scholarship in the portal?,btohqsg
all the global merit ppl i know basically 90RP + H3 and some epic talent,btohqsg
the other 2 is uni level,btohqsg
u referring to the non merit/global ones right,btohqsg
but merit is the easiest to get alr,btohqsg
now uni level focusing more on SoC and all the stem courses,btohqsg
how do you know whether the faculty offers a lot or not,btohqsg
so they allocate more scholarships to those courses,btohqsg
it didnt have any slider :(,btohqsg
and cos i know the profs HAHA,btohqsg
SoC got a lot of merit scholarships,btohqsg
cos waste money ah so called HAHA,btohqsg
not good return on investment HAHA,btohqsg
what about for faculty of law?,btohqsg
Last time they at still see FASS got up. Then when Yale-NUS started  the good FASSers go there. Left balance of FASS. Which they see no up,btohqsg
me get into cam and stan  never even get invited for nus scholarship interview,btohqsg
i think if no 90RP for FASS den shdnt even bother HAHA,btohqsg
cos the only ppl i know who got scholarship fromFASS r the 90RP ppl,btohqsg
I @ you to agree ba,btohqsg
cos NUS think u r shit bro,btohqsg
yalenus is not about fass- -,btohqsg
thats right nus see me no up,btohqsg
cos ppl will go NUS law regardless of whether got scholarship or not,btohqsg
they have very few scholarships also,btohqsg
STEM has the bulk of scholarships,btohqsg
everyone else just fights for the rest HAHA,btohqsg
Hopefully i’ll get the other scholarship then :’),btohqsg
oops me get into law and computing also never get invited for scholarship,btohqsg
nus see me no up sia,btohqsg
They say if you use the word “Sinkie” in your application  sure will get accept one. The ppl who review applications got many EDMWers and Sammyboy ppl. They will help you out.,btohqsg
could be due to your personal essay tho,btohqsg
yah nus see u no up,btohqsg
er me get into stan i dont think my essay got prob,btohqsg
nah lol its a 90RP thing,btohqsg
no 90RP dont think abt scholarship generally,btohqsg
Typical Sinkie. Cannot make it in SG have to go overseas. Reject.,btohqsg
eh me from poly means no scholarship har,btohqsg
If cannot get scholarship  don’t waste time with application. Just make TikTok,btohqsg
Very little ppl in NUS Law/Med/Dentistry are on NUS Merit/Global merit,btohqsg
tiktok is some new meme is it,btohqsg
Apply for internship at SGAG or Smart Local. NubbadTv,btohqsg
u must be super uber duper,btohqsg
Now even Mongabong also take interns,btohqsg
banker see lawyer and medic like see some peasant sia,btohqsg
probably alr go supreme court represent case,btohqsg
NUS merit scholarship in med is ultimate stonks$200k sgd covered,btohqsg
The only student i heard getting it was from NUS high,btohqsg
otherwise if u applying law i think dont bother for scholarship la,btohqsg

if u dont have 90RP den i think dont even begin,btohqsg
if u law apply bursary lor,btohqsg
and if u no experience intern for law firm or law related volunteer stuff,btohqsg
Can try is can tryBut whether get or not is another thing,btohqsg
or law leadership whatever that means HAHA,btohqsg
The Millenials of Singapore also take interns. But they only take intellectuals. Because fit their company atmosphere,btohqsg
But dont get ur hopes up,btohqsg
but dont have high expectations lor,btohqsg
me sad kenna look down cos from poly,btohqsg
u can try the perf arts one,btohqsg
U dont need that to enter law anyway,btohqsg
if u got expereince i think more chacne u get that,btohqsg
But for scholarship maybe it helpsBut depends,btohqsg
yea u just need to be able to bullshit ur way through,btohqsg
Maybe can try NIE. Teaching confirm get scholarship one,btohqsg
i applied smu law i also got just cos i bs LOL,btohqsg
Ur chances of getting a teaching scholarship without internship is almost 0%,btohqsg
its like uni apps on easy mode,btohqsg
Then if you tired of teaching  can become a private tutor. And dabble as property agent too. Maybe stand at MRT at do insurans also.,btohqsg
Unless u talking about NIE-NTU Scholars programme,btohqsg
no 90rp gets harder like exponentially,btohqsg
Source: Principal at this yr's MOE scholarship panel,btohqsg

Oh no... u are the 3rd person here to ask that,btohqsg
i havent been on tg for ages,btohqsg
Aiya NUS also full of trolls,btohqsg
Already told him to scan both sides of the PDF screen. He never listen,btohqsg
cos computing is full of fucking trollers,btohqsg
I’ve compressed the files individually  I’ve compressed the files when it is merged tgt,btohqsg
I remembered taking pics of my certs and uploaded online  black and white and lowest resolution,btohqsg
I just submitted my application 2 wks ago,btohqsg
And I explained I’m using a phone app to scan le  I can’t do that  you never listen,btohqsg
Do double sided scan la dey,btohqsg
god dw u to get scholarship,btohqsg
You always NEVER LISTEN. Must always do it your way.,btohqsg
What are you using to merge the PDFs?What DPI are your images? Are they lossless formats?,btohqsg
I will prob take cs as a 2nd major,btohqsg
where got image is lossless one,btohqsg
Lunch you say can eat ANYTHING. Then I suggest mcnoner  you angry. What sia,btohqsg
What’s lossless format!! I’m using the online compresser and merger,btohqsg
u think fractal or vector drawing meh,btohqsg
Walao. Your scans all losing data ley!!! Incomplete scans. No wonder,btohqsg
What are the individual file sizes before merging?,btohqsg
Mostly? Means more than 1? How do you expect individual files less than 1MB to all together be <2MB?,btohqsg
I dont understand how come so much MB 0.0,btohqsg
Try go Mustafa Center right now. Ask the guy on second floor where to buy scanner.,btohqsg
1.6 + 0.6 + 0.7 + 1.2 + 0.6 = 4.7,btohqsg
That’s before I compressed each file,btohqsg
No wonder la. Boomer using Mac,btohqsg
But the compression is not helping anyways,btohqsg
The file size is so big bc I had to add the admission number and name at the top,btohqsg
Time to take intro to information theory to learn how to properly compress that to under 2,btohqsg
U compressed will definitely lower mb by a lot oneThen u convert it to zip  mb will also decrease even further,btohqsg
Use Windows everything faster than the boomer Apple MacBook Pork,btohqsg
look at the number of “compressed”s LOL,btohqsg
i still rmb nus application form hhhh,btohqsg
