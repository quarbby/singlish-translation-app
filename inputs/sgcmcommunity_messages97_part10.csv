My car got bombed by this yesterday,btohqsg
The mother like suddenly all the eggs hatch üòµ‚Äçüí´ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò° all over the roof of my car sia,btohqsg
Bruh it's about the size of a 5c coin... I don't dare take any closer... I cropped up the photo,btohqsg
Just how much can you save driving an EV?Is going electric really cheaper?Sgcarmart Editorial Team does the science to find out the precise difference between ICE and EV from a dollars and cents perspective.You'll actually be surprised by the conclusion! - JRead the full article herehttp://bit.ly/3EIIXNG,btohqsg
I still think the high road tax is to even out with ice users lol,btohqsg
Once ice 99% scrapped  the road tax would be lower but unlikely to match ice levels,btohqsg
Cos if they dun  then using ev would have substantial savings compared to ice,btohqsg
Road tax is based on emission  for zero emission cars you'd expect 0 road tax but nahhhhh,btohqsg

ev is not 0 emissions tho,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt understand how come diesel is more expensive than petrol,btohqsg
hence the high 5k+ road tax for EVs,btohqsg
Yes because more power= more emission,btohqsg
size of battery  contents of battery  alot of many other factors to consider,btohqsg
Diesel engines are more efficient  that's why the FC better than petrol,btohqsg
Diesel used to be at least $1 cheaper den petrol,btohqsg
Now seems like going towards the other direction,btohqsg
diesel prices have gone up worldwide with increase in fuel demand in the shipping industry,btohqsg
Alot of factors to consider when u argue EV is more environmentally friendly. Recycling of battery? or are we just dumping it onto a landfield? Limited resources?,btohqsg
if you are driving an EV  i hope you offset your carbon emission by driving a second car with more than 8 cylindersü§óü§ó,btohqsg
production of battery itself causes so much emissions,btohqsg
I shall go back to citing the Volvo study of xc40 recharge vs xc40 ICE emissions,btohqsg
i rmb is they cut diesel production for some reason,btohqsg
i got more data  you want?,btohqsg
ceteris paribus for driving usage and conditions  based on real use emissions of the ICE engine and the production emissions of the EV. You need to drive the EV 160k km to reach net zero emissions compared to the the ICE car,btohqsg
and only then are you producing a lower carbon footprint,btohqsg
The basis of that was just to find an equitable system to tax richer (since they can afford larger cc cars)folks for car ownership,btohqsg
however  the study did not include disposal of battery  changing battery after 8 to 10 years for continuous usage of car and did not include emissions from non renewable sources of electricity,btohqsg
Similar to COE  I reckon they will just revise it to account for ev classifications,btohqsg
When people don't buy new stuffs  manufacturers can't produce new stuffs. When manufacturers can't produce new stuffs  they can't produce emissions.,btohqsg
The effect is so broad that barely any end consumer feels it.,btohqsg
Buying an EV doesn't make anyone become some earth saving nerd. Driving it until it cannot be driven then talk. But wait! Manufacturers now control how long you keep a car - planned obsolescence. You want to drive past 5 years also hard. Waste = emissions too.,btohqsg
Its the same as what manufacturers and consumers too  letting Govs handle it. Never ending cycle.When an EV maker sells the car  their emissions for that car ends  and the ball is now in the customer's court. Whatever emissions next  is the customer's call. When the customer let go the car  its now other people's problem. Most who buy EV don't even drive it until the breakeven numbers. Volvo calculates the XC40 ICE vs Recharge to have a 146 000km breakeven number (using fossil fuels for electricity production).,btohqsg
Quote from outside articles:-There are differences in three items: the emissions in the use phase (by far the largest item in the case of the combustion engine)  the production and supply chain of raw materials and  in the case of the electric cars  battery production. Volvo puts the latter at around 4-5 tonnes of CO2 per vehicle.If you add up the individual items that occur until the car is handed over to the customer  the CO2 emissions of the C40 Recharge (and the all-electric XC40) are around 70 per cent higher than those of the combustion model. The big difference is in the use phase ‚Äì calculated at 200 000 kilometres.To fully exploit the potential of electric cars  Volvo Cars is therefore calling for more investment in clean energy. ‚ÄúWe need green power throughout the supply chain and production  not just in the use phase when charging ‚Äù says Otterheim.,btohqsg
Volvo themselves have said that climate neutrality needs the part of everyone. YES. Start by making reliable cars. Start by telling your consumers not to keep changing cars. Walk the damn talk. They want people to spend more money to become greener.,btohqsg
Volvo included in their XC40/C40 Recharge report  that the Li-ion battery is assumed to be taken out of the vehicle and sent to recycling. The metal fractions can be sent for further refining and in the end material recycling. The combustible part of the light fraction can be incinerated for energy  or the entire fraction can end up in landfill. For the purpose of this study  it is assumed the combustible streams of materials are incinerated  while the non-combustible materials are landfilled.Due to the global focus  no energy recovery is included for the incineration steps  even though in some Volvo Cars markets  there is indeed energy recovery from incineration of waste. This somewhat conservative assumption has been made since there are many markets with no energy recovery taking place  and data on how common the case with energy recovery is for the combustible streams is unknown. Assessment of material losses after shredding and in refining are outside the system boundaries set by the cut-off approach.,btohqsg
How about transporting the used batteries? Likely a diesel truck or locomotive. And recyling batteries are extremely expensive too. So much needs to be done still. As of now  its a laugh when people say they buy EV to go green. C'mon. Bluff who? Probably the consumer who believe is being bluffed.,btohqsg
enjoy. Forwarded from one of the volvo gurus,btohqsg
they didn't even account for fossil fuels for electricity production in that study iirc,btohqsg
and general emissions from use of materials,btohqsg
there was a fossil fuel for electricity component but very minute one,btohqsg
This was part of the reason why Tesla itself was struck off the S&P 500,btohqsg
No clear carbon strategy or poor conduct codes,btohqsg
Musk himself said ESG is a scam .. ü§î,btohqsg
No more carbon credits to trade,btohqsg
Almost fell for this! Until I saw this,btohqsg
Cause lta know a lot of 1000 horse power car coming   road tax 11 k and a above huat ar!!!,btohqsg
10 year road tax like such is a coe alreadg,btohqsg
tesla is no longer in SP500 index?,btohqsg
show me the link  of news,btohqsg
