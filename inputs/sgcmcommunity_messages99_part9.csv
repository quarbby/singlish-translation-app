Please remain civilised and refrain from personal attacks if you would still like to remain in this group. This is a group for car lovers to make friends  share knowledge and generally just positive vibes. 😊While Sgcarmart understands that everyone has their own point of view that each individual may feel very passionately about  we do not condone ridiculing fellow members for having different perspectives.- E,btohqsg

Nothing warrants such cursing. To err is to be human. When you drive u also make mistakes people curse you to oblivion doesn't feel good right.,btohqsg
I’m not condoning speeding and only behind responsible crazy stunts,btohqsg
But uhh  to each their own and I guess it’s not nice to hear?,btohqsg
Hating them for doing it because of something you’ve experienced is like generalising the car community to be a bunch of hoons who speed and race on the streets of Singapore on a daily basis.,btohqsg
Not saying what they did was right  but 🤷🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
But hey  whatever it is your experience was  sorry to hear. Sucks to have experienced the short end of the stick,btohqsg
