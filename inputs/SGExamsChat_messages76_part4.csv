This conversation really exposes how differently people think of ACSI and ACJC,btohqsg
i dropped most special programmes during sec sch like olympiads,btohqsg
acsi is smart + high ses,btohqsg
let alone some lame gep shit,btohqsg
How many threads are going on at this time,btohqsg
not interested in any of these shits,btohqsg
acjc might not have rich keeds,btohqsg
Unsw tests are pretty much lame as hell,btohqsg
they are both just other jcs,btohqsg
I always brag that I take no math combi in JC right? Fun fact: i got distinction for UNSW Math in Sec 1.,btohqsg
ACSI cfm rich people  look at talon can liao,btohqsg
why is talon a thing on tele too anyw,btohqsg
my bff from acjc and he lives on breadcrumbs that were used to feed pigeons,btohqsg
Let’s just say that I am,btohqsg
"I don't get the unsw test ""prestige"" shit",btohqsg
It is literally lame as hell and easy distinction,btohqsg
science is CS1010S instead i rmb-ed,btohqsg
It's true  unsw tests are a joke...,btohqsg
But it seems like special term they don’t offer it,btohqsg
usernamewho do u think is most popz girl in our cohort,btohqsg
Ya thanks to all the missions,btohqsg
But if they offered 1101 I would take it though,btohqsg
i took e so idk the s side,btohqsg
Not bell curved so got chance,btohqsg
The SES divide is showing. That is my only distinction  have a few merit  but loads of participation.,btohqsg
but honestly i would be more than happy to get a B+,btohqsg
everything is just additions to portfolio in the end,btohqsg
cs was the most mindraping course i took so far,btohqsg
I was in a 190+ secondary school and I don't think you consider that elite,btohqsg
ngl i gonna try for it as a 2nd major,btohqsg
i genuinely tot 190+ refers to height,btohqsg
Lol its actually a waste of major imo,btohqsg
Some hci sec ppl are idiots too,btohqsg
It predicted im gonna procrastinate for the rest of my life,btohqsg
Some <Insert organisation here> ppl are idiots  will always be true,btohqsg
Schools use it to predict how well their kids will do,btohqsg
and 230 isnt damn bad LOL,btohqsg
There will be some anomalies after all,btohqsg
The best predictor is a qualitative analysis of the person,btohqsg
Literally anything is better than sorting students out when they are young,btohqsg
Predict how much of a chao mugger you are?,btohqsg
Got ppl with 90 rank points in a lvl getting like 20 points for o lvls,btohqsg
idk i felt like psle is kinda accurate if there is no diff in quality of teaching in diff sec sch,btohqsg
"No  o levels is really a brain dead way to ""gauge"" a student's knowledge",btohqsg
PSLE doesnt predict  PSLE covertly inserts a glass ceiling,btohqsg
Well  u will nvr know unless u are an MOE teacher/intern,btohqsg
I asked you to sort out your life but it seems like you are using bogosort,btohqsg
but tho  that may be true for JC but not for poly,btohqsg
And saw the literal PSLE to O lvl graphs,btohqsg
You can really tell the difference between students in a 230 and 210 school,btohqsg
