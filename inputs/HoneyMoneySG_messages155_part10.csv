Any reviews on the new Amex Gold Credit Card?,btohqsg
HSBC credit card points seem to have been significantly reduced. The 9X points awarded do not appear to match expectations.,btohqsg
Did you spend on the right mcc and online?,btohqsg
uniqlo  contact lens  restaurants. exclude fast food,btohqsg
HSBC Revo is an online only card now. Contactless only earns 0.4mpd.,btohqsg
only online and in-app and cannot use any wallet like gpay  samsung pay?,btohqsg
Wallet can but must be in app. Cannot tap tap.,btohqsg
thanks for the info  anyway still cannot match.even if I remove those ineligible pay wave transactions.,btohqsg
I signed up HSBC EGA promo for Feb & March. The bonus interest will be given out on 31 May.  Since today is 1 March  technically I have earned the bonus interest for Feb. If I were to transfer everything out and maintain only required minimum balance of 2K  will the bonus interest for Feb be forfeited? Going through the T&C  I didnt find anything on this. Can anyone advise? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
If person has personal & joint.Person register for joint account first month  2nd month register for personal.If registered account with current promo cannot be overwrited.Then it is possible to do;Joint:Mar - fund in (register 3mth)Apr - fund outMay - fund inPersonal:Apr - fund in (register 3 mth)May - fund outJun - fund inContinue toJoint:Jul - fund in (register 3mth)Aug - fund outSep - fund inPersonal:Aug - fund in (register 3mth)Sep - fund outOct - fund inRepeat üîÅ until HSBC bankruptsDoes this work?Considering past history suggest account that's been registered with current promotion will run until finished campaign.So joint registration does not affect personal registration.Where is Mt???,btohqsg
In my case  I can safely expect to receive the Feb bonus interests in 31 May then? Thanks for confirming.,btohqsg
Anyone know how to do this registration on app? I can't find on my app,btohqsg
Too complicated. I only do all individual names,btohqsg
Hi  would like to check if UOB one acc fresh fund need to be transferred from other bank? If from uob acc under different person name work?,btohqsg
Read the tnc for the definition,btohqsg
It's in the app. Randomly banner.Anyway use sms.,btohqsg
iPayMy can be used and it did award points. I can confirm this as I just checked my statement and points were awarded.iPayMy also gives points guarantee for DBS Vantage.Edit: I went through T&C and it doesn‚Äôt say that iPayMy is excluded.,btohqsg
Is it just me or are capitavouchers no longer on wogi,btohqsg
Hi Experts I have a question regarding HSBC EGA. Is it worth to open a new account now? as I see in the tnc only Accounts opened on or before 31 December 2024 are eligible for bonus interest.,btohqsg
GG already. Don't waste time.I also surprised HSBC give a promo only old users can enjoy.So funny.,btohqsg
Hi Experts  any idea how to redeem insta point if there is only 225 IPs?,btohqsg
hi guys  I'm just starting to invest and wondering if IBKR or moomoo would be better for me. I'm still an undergrad so I will be looking to trade around 500/month. I already have an existing account with moomoo so I can't take advantage of the new user stuff or commission free trades  would it still be cheaper?,btohqsg
Psa: kfc trust card $5 off $40Please keep this link. A lot of kfc I went to still don‚Äôt know about this offer. Insisted expired December 2024.https://www.kfc.com.sg/Coupon/Promotion,btohqsg
any gurus here know if Mari CC better or Trust Cashback for oversea ? due to the diff in spreads,btohqsg
If you go often to KFC  why not SC Smart ü§≠,btohqsg
"Anyone here have been using this function in moomoo "" Stock Yield Enhancement Program""  any feedback ?",btohqsg
Did GXS drop interest rates for the 3 month tenure from 2.98% to 2.88% without notice??,btohqsg
Hi all  does UOB One Min spend of 500 look at transaction date or posted on date?,btohqsg
Search chat history ‚ÄúUob one 500 date‚Äù,btohqsg
Easier to reply than typing your answer. See  now I‚Äôm boss ü§£,btohqsg
It serves different purpose n have different objective. Can you imaging there are 19k members here and everybody post repetitive questions? Sooner or later you will ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/269207,btohqsg
I know. But you are not obliged to reply anyway,btohqsg
IMO trust cashback is better as you have additional 1-15% cashback on your spend,btohqsg
i see! good pointpublic transport and online travel i can just switch the uob ladys category by the quarter i guess,btohqsg
Joint registration very risky. You don't know when they decide to change something again then end up void either one of your registration.,btohqsg
any news regarding hsbc live+ bonus 8% cashback period? will they extend past march 2025?,btohqsg
The problem is there's a clause that defines fresh funds as only those that are not withdrawn from any hsbc accounts in the user's name in the last 30 days. It doesn't say this is not applicable to joint accounts. Whether this rule is enforced  I'm also interested to know.,btohqsg
Yeah. Guess best to just split up the mess.,btohqsg
HSBC want to tell us don't be funny.They also know it's hard to enforce.But they want to say something nevertheless.,btohqsg
It's not hard to enforce. CPF is already using a similar rule. Just a matter if anyone tracked closely enough to see if their system captures this.,btohqsg
They won't do until like that  unless it's very clear cut...So far they have been paying the interest.,btohqsg
yup  no issues. you can xfer the money out,btohqsg
It's easier to enforce CPF one because it's a single month and single account reference while UOB/HSBC one slightly harder because it spans across multiple months and multiple accounts.,btohqsg
Hi  I heard that 10 Mar onwards Instarem Amaze card will incur 1% for all SGD transactions instead of fee waiver below $1000. How will it affect on me using CitiReward accumulating points to redeem miles if I choose not to use Amaze and avoid paying for that 1%?,btohqsg
Not being able to use citi rewards offline in Singapore anymore?,btohqsg
You only can spend certain transactions online and certain transactions contactless in SGD depending on the whitelist. Check t&c to find out.,btohqsg
Ok i was wrong. Citi rewards has a list of shopping mcc that still can do offline. Still  usage of citi rewards offline is limited now.,btohqsg
To be fair  you can still use Amaze & Citi rewards in selective situations. This is different from the current situation where you can use this combo for almost all situations. This is the give and take. Think first before you decide what card to use in a given situation.,btohqsg
For my use  I will be using UOB PPV to cover local dinning and shopping. For online  I will use CRMC. For oversea spending  I will still use Amaze+CRMC. There are special situations that I may still use Amaze+CRMC like for large items that allow to earn substantial points which I feel outweigh the cost of local fees.  But have to see case by case.,btohqsg
