Opinion on the New Redesign on the new AMG,btohqsg
the front end looks so much like the new GR,btohqsg
part one of my 0808 vlog series!,btohqsg
watch how we drove with the GTR club to raffles marina ðŸ¤“,btohqsg
I identify as a screaming V10,btohqsg
And I have hearing loss from v12s,btohqsg
wanna go out with me tdy,btohqsg
Cool..hv plan wana come last nite doin vlog too.but raining my side make me cancel..most probably 2nite,btohqsg
Front end is whatever the but the rear kinda assðŸ’€,btohqsg
now it looks obese  too long and too lurchy,btohqsg
looks fucking awful that's for sure,btohqsg
i dont understand why they needed to connect the tails,btohqsg
rear end i dont like the 2 arches on top of the reflector,btohqsg
i'm getting their hint at the CLE/E,btohqsg
in fact i like the rear of the E,btohqsg
the front fender gill makes it look like a BMW,btohqsg
Mercedes screwed the CLE  AMG GT over.,btohqsg
Front headlights giving me jaguar/gr86 vibes,btohqsg
I think u can see it,btohqsg
/ report for unsolicited amg gt pic,btohqsg
i hate that grille with a passion,btohqsg
it's like they forgot how to stop redesigning the front,btohqsg
Its always they can make the front end good but not the rear,btohqsg
how did merc fuck this up  i genuinely don't get it,btohqsg
the 2+2 probably can't even fit anyone in the back,btohqsg
Come we ask the professional AMG Lover@tunaaonigiriwhat she think,btohqsg
but the stinger is neat though I gotta say,btohqsg
the best AMG Coupe still is the CLK63 Black,btohqsg
10 points if you can guess,btohqsg
If you can afford it yourself sure.,btohqsg
maybe the W204 C63 BS. but the CLK looks sexier.,btohqsg
oh yes I love he clk63,btohqsg
clk dtm amg another super nice one,btohqsg
basically this but max stats lol,btohqsg
let down by the gearbox unfortunately,btohqsg
arguably the BS is nicer than the DTM,btohqsg
hmm its nice but I wouldnt say nicer but the same level I guess,btohqsg
but once you see the curves you start getting hints that it's not normal,btohqsg
indeed. and the front bumper vents,btohqsg
see this@tunaaonigirisuddenly quiet bcause she only know the amg gtr,btohqsg
very tastefully done up not too obvious but not too subtle,btohqsg
kinda wish they made the S211 E63 to a larger scale too.,btohqsg
clk dtm clk63 is the real raw amgsðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’,btohqsg
i dont get what was the point of pinging meðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Love these but not a big fan of the tails,btohqsg
no idea why merc did away with the fender gills. really subtle,btohqsg
i think this was the PFL E63?,btohqsg
i like the sedan tails more,btohqsg
I feel the oval tails dont rlly fit the car,btohqsg
they evolved and took to land so the gills disappeared like what happened during the ice age,btohqsg
i think the estate tails never *really* looked that good.,btohqsg
pls come and help me gluglugluglugluglug,btohqsg
the 212 and 213 are neat,btohqsg
digging the pics out from my archive ðŸ˜—,btohqsg
I like the f31 wagon thing,btohqsg
I dont think theres any in SG,btohqsg
You bismillah first maybe youll see one,btohqsg
I think paint could be a brighter,btohqsg
@ArghMeinGottI want to see some clk dtm amgs,btohqsg
i am not a huge fan of the DTM AMG,btohqsg
not the new ones though. they suck ass.,btohqsg
everytime a DK post comes on my feed i do as well,btohqsg
Underrated but e200's kompressors are slept on,btohqsg
say it. E250 is the best. W213 E250 is the best.,btohqsg
Iridium Silver W213 E250 Avantgarde is the best,btohqsg
E200 Kompressor the 4 door so cool tbh it gives off mafia vibes,btohqsg
here's a picture I took early this yr/late last yr,btohqsg
alamak u don remind me of the girl with the bentlyðŸ’€,btohqsg

but idk if cfm cos rain,btohqsg
i got like things to do tdy,btohqsg
what did i expect from a PFL W204,btohqsg
RPF1's arent bad lookin on this,btohqsg
W204s are the F10s of Merc.,btohqsg
its a nice weather to sleep,btohqsg
this one is abang-ified not beng,btohqsg
as an FD2R enthusiast i disagree,btohqsg
but his one is one of the neater ones Ive seen I gotta say,btohqsg
better than those bright colors and slammed and 2cm panel gaps,btohqsg
u are talking to someone that prefers the Elegance trim,btohqsg
Literally same rear end as the redesigned GTðŸ’€,btohqsg
but minus points because see through bonnet,btohqsg
the W214 looks like a baby S,btohqsg
but cool leh his bonnet window,btohqsg
this angle makes it look massive,btohqsg
Why the tailights look like the eye brows stuck together,btohqsg
If im not mistaken most of them were v12s right,btohqsg
still arguably the best aston ever.,btohqsg
Today the thing kena burn down,btohqsg
the hilux was the most painful one.,btohqsg
the r32 one was also painful,btohqsg
the Hilux was the most cringeworthy one,btohqsg

Rental van also kena caught in the crossfire,btohqsg
