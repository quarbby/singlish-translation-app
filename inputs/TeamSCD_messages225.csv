hi guyss! just a quick question for those who knows about coding errors. I encountered one coding error when checking my car yesterday at a workshop.Error code was DTC 3539 - the boost pressure deviates from the specific value.It‚Äôs something new to my mechanic man as well and cant seem to correct that error. I checked online and most of it comes to no avail. Online also no solutions,btohqsg

‚Ä¶ roi papa pls dont boomz,btohqsg
Got any voucher for modified car stuff one?,btohqsg
there got say everyday needs  car if drive everyday can liaoif your plate red colour‚Ä¶ sorry ah,btohqsg
drive on road shoulder sure wont jam bo,btohqsg
i need to go out more,btohqsg
I dont think there is any motorized country that goes a day without traffic accidents.,btohqsg
I‚Äôve been hit by 3 taxi/phv already in this lifetime üòÇ,btohqsg
In all 3 cases i am quite sure i would have died if i was a rider. Hence no 2b for me,btohqsg
Nope. Just a normal 9-5er and weekend with family,btohqsg
Taxi and phv dont care abt how often u drive,btohqsg
They can even catch u just outside ur house,btohqsg
A phv did an illegal u turn without signalling or checking mirror- while i am on his right,btohqsg
U mean if u are the renter?,btohqsg
If u are not at fault  either way u pay nothing,btohqsg
If u are  then just know rental insurance is as good as no insurance,btohqsg
it will help but still higher than u think,btohqsg
some rental cars dont even have their dashcam,btohqsg
I wouldnt accept to drive such tbh,btohqsg
there is no case scenario where renting is cheaper than a car in the long run,btohqsg
but what about loss of income?,btohqsg
or if they deem you are at fault?,btohqsg
or they repair more than damaged?,btohqsg
The person not at fault gets to claim the other,btohqsg
there is no such thing as full protection in renting,btohqsg
If the vehicle is the source of income,btohqsg
If not  u get loss of use,btohqsg
is not about whether have 50% or dont have,btohqsg
U know if u own your phv u still can get loss of income,btohqsg
is the fact that even after 50% lowered  the amount is still absurdly high,btohqsg
even if the engine blows on you  it can be deemed as your fault,btohqsg
Thats because ur insurance cant recoup with higher premiums after the accident,btohqsg
i talking abt CDW in rentalsss,btohqsg
And i was talking about excess in general,btohqsg
If u rent  drive like a mouse is what i would suggest,btohqsg
u can search up rental accident cases,btohqsg
they will give u amount but no break down,btohqsg
that total amount usually is equal to more damage than sustained,btohqsg
+ loss of income + possibly more damage than said,btohqsg
in the event u cant prove *,btohqsg
Own damage is the damage to your rental vehicle. 3rd party is the other vehicle(s) involved. It doesnt mean u pay,btohqsg
U are lowering ur excess payable,btohqsg
And u pay that excess if u have fault in an accident,btohqsg
they can still charge loss of income,btohqsg
I mean u need to understand half of that is from the third party,btohqsg
Look. U are seeing worst case scenarios where third party claims u more than 5.5k,btohqsg
The truth is u are best served by private settlement and self repair,btohqsg
If the rental company does the repair first thing on your bill is their loss of vehicle use,btohqsg
last i heard  engine problems‚Ä¶user had to pay although they had the CDW,btohqsg
If they say the repair and survey process is 2 weeks u just rented that car 2 weeks,btohqsg
U playing bumper car or what,btohqsg
u mean carsharing or rent frm garage?,btohqsg
most of the time they will let go dont worry,btohqsg
U not talking about door dings right,btohqsg
rock chips & smaller dents that cannot be controlled  haven‚Äôt heard a problem so far,btohqsg
got cases the engines just piang,btohqsg
How does it work if i refuse to pay,btohqsg
but rly not even the hirer fault,btohqsg
3 letter of reminder then court case?,btohqsg
The worst they can do is drag u to small claims,btohqsg
ya if u talking abt car sharing,btohqsg
but the minimum amt they need to inflate,btohqsg
Where they need to explain to the judge that ur 1 day rental is responsible for the 200k mileage engine problem,btohqsg
Do u see where im going with this,btohqsg
here is for car sharing engine issue,btohqsg
then the 5pm return turned into 4.30pmacc locked  deposit forfeit,btohqsg
app issue but didn‚Äôt bother to fightnot my choice  was the main drivers choice,btohqsg
rented two cars w the same person as my main driver,btohqsg
one of which was okay condition,btohqsg
the other one was torn & damaged lor,btohqsg
okay means got scratches & other stuff,btohqsg
we extend booking fr one hr,btohqsg
then because we were OTR we nvr see any changes,btohqsg
once car returned  suddenly we got the notif we return late,btohqsg
i own in a way  so i only used car sharing for fun,btohqsg
cos once u have ur own   is no point renting unless for fun,btohqsg
in certain cases ownership is cheaper than rentalbut end of the day taking grab can still be even cheaperall depends on ur priorities,btohqsg
heard all their issues were solved well,btohqsg
theres no rental where u dont require deposit iinw,btohqsg
GetGo is horrendously disgusting or bad condition,btohqsg
Dunno. Don‚Äôt bother to see EV‚Äôs either. They tire me,btohqsg
cos there are ppl who ik who rent getgo? and i‚Äôve sat in them?,btohqsg
be careful renting getgo too  a friend got a warning letter because his father let him driveboth have license but he was not insured by GG,btohqsg
But if you‚Äôre having a service to accomodate others  these are what you will be judged on,btohqsg
it‚Äôs not a by fault basis  it‚Äôs a review,btohqsg
at the time driver not added. iinw it was late night or smtg and his father was js tired,btohqsg
dunno how getgo found out also :),btohqsg
ok la but end of the day;as someone who has this convo at least once a weekCarlite is the best all rounder and the easiest to work with. Price wise & selection can be better but it is the best car sharing platform at the moment,btohqsg
neither was he a p-plater at the moment,btohqsg
and no  he is not covered by GG insurance. cos no GG acc,btohqsg
let me dig my friends review,btohqsg
Shariot (Pump petrol urself):Pros:-$0 deposit.-Wide range of models.-Cheapest van rental ($6.90/h all day excluding GST & Plat. fee)-Attractive 12h rental rate.-Active telegram group.Neutral:-Average customer service (Live Chat & Telegram).Cons:-Vehicle cleanliness and maintenance.-Ugly stickers.-No access to physical car key.,btohqsg
GetGo is most ex iirc correctly,btohqsg
yes? how else would you cover insurance in the most economical way if it wasnt by name,btohqsg
CarLite (Pump petrol urself)Pros:-Cars have no stickers.-Access to physical car key.-Newish cars.-Attractive full day rental rate.-Cheapest rental in the market (off-peak).-Excellent customer service (Call).Neutral:-Exterior condition of cars (scratches).Cons:-Limited locations.-Smallest vehicle fleet.-Higher deposit ($300) for P-Plate.GetGo (Mileage charged)Pros:-Very convenient locations.-$0 deposit.-Wide range of models.-Don‚Äôt need to worry about petrol.Neutral:-Average customer service (Live Chat).Cons:-No access to physical car key.-Ugly ‚ÄúGetGo‚Äù stickers.-Mileage charge is costly if you‚Äôre covering a long distance.,btohqsg
last i was discussing abt it w my friend,btohqsg
the providing petrol part + cleanliness doesn‚Äôt make up for the price bro,btohqsg
it costs more to use than to pump,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt make a big diff frm what i‚Äôve gathered,btohqsg
Cos u pay more than needed lor,btohqsg
peak hr - 8 hrs rental$80lets say 90km$35.1,btohqsg
CDW 5% and the rest i dont put in,btohqsg
u pay $115.10 exclusive of the rest,btohqsg
if i compare to tribe;8hrs rental is roughly $60 bucks? or less? i don‚Äôt recall$25 Petrol +20% disc depends on gas station card also,btohqsg
brother u ask for advice on which car sharing is the best,btohqsg
now is u compare apples to oranges leh bro,btohqsg
pricewise ; your carlite still win nia,btohqsg
pump $20-25 is enough for a day‚Äôs trip but depends on what car and what ur doing,btohqsg
then we talk abt vehicle condition,btohqsg
carlite straight away win getgo anyday customer service‚Ä¶problem solving‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Availability of cars & choices is the only con,btohqsg
chill leh bro dont need caps,btohqsg
GetGo in event of accident must ask staff to come down & evaluate,btohqsg
@chloetherx8due to my inability to fulfil promises,btohqsg
i would like to ask you the same thing he has asked me,btohqsg
if you are to give him a ride in your car for him to learn about cars.he is still young & keen to learn üôèüèª,btohqsg

You know you can go to waze and just set avoid toll roads right,btohqsg

From west to east then you'd encounter ERP during peak hours,btohqsg
Everyone still suffering from monday blues,btohqsg
thursday nights and friday nights traffic will be heavier,btohqsg
You can't because you're still in school,btohqsg
You go ask your parents do they go on date nights on Monday and tuesdays,btohqsg
