Someone burnt a piece of their merc to appease the spirits,btohqsg
Looking for advice  shld I drop pure lit now since my results aren't going up,btohqsg
I dowan take it in jc,btohqsg
whole of sec 3 has it been v poor?,btohqsg
where u also struggle a lot with it,btohqsg
The only a2 i got was bc project,btohqsg
And the feeling and memorable qn is quite hard,btohqsg
And if I can't find time to read the novel this year next year it's gonna get worse with crucible,btohqsg
cuz if the results u consistently getting are not what u want and u really tried ur best but can't improve then might be best to drop it,btohqsg
And I realise I can use my 2 sciences and 2 maths + my hist/ss for the r5,btohqsg
And ny ss/hist is usually good by that I mean As,btohqsg
honestly don't talk to us abt this matter  try talking to your teachers or parents abt this  they know more abt you and your performance  here i only know what u said in chat,btohqsg
But tbh I dont rlly like lit,btohqsg
then why did u take it  at first in sec 2 u liked it? or u seemed to be doing good?,btohqsg
I took it bc I thought I'd improve,btohqsg
And i felt it was a little more interesting than geog,btohqsg
at this rate i think its best u drop pure lit as early as possible  no point in trying so hard to improve when it's q evident that u haven't,btohqsg
but again  talk to ur teachers or parents abt it,btohqsg
Ok  thank you for the inputs  I'll consider with these in mind!,btohqsg
it's good you've found out this issue before sec 4,btohqsg
Bc if I'm spending effort it shld be worth it,btohqsg
And I asked myself do I really want to do it,btohqsg
bro learning H1 econs without even taking it,btohqsg
Just curious is h2 econs worth,btohqsg
what do you define as worth,btohqsg
As in worthwhile to upgrade it to h2,btohqsg
you take h1 first then you see how,btohqsg
u no need h2 econs to earn a decent salary mah,btohqsg
you in NS as an ASA,btohqsg
i mean the h2 vs h1 thing is just are you planning to do anything that might use h2 econs and if not  it's mainly how it affects rp,btohqsg
I can't even get an A in jt,btohqsg
Lit is harder to mug also right,btohqsg
Like how do I even mug lit,btohqsg
you should have asked yourself that before taking it,btohqsg
and this is also why i dropped it,btohqsg
