Around 10 m and above for smallPlace,btohqsg
If u got property agent friend can ask them those rich ppl income kinda crazy 1 haha,btohqsg
Even property and insurance agent got so many million dollar table ppl last year,btohqsg
just now i saw a sinkie tesla 3 with dual tone colors - green and black. whose?,btohqsg
There are so many of it,btohqsg
Saw a ioniq 5 today. Looks handsome,btohqsg
Would prefer an ioniq over tesla  unironically,btohqsg
Just find the exterior unique and rare in sg too,btohqsg
Not the usual ioniq. Ioniq 5,btohqsg
Looks very retro-futuristic  absolutely love the lights. Pulls like a MF ü§£,btohqsg
There's a few options  all of them look great!,btohqsg
Also very spacious on the inside,btohqsg
Not on sale yet I believe,btohqsg
Only a few units were brought in as part of a pilot project between SP group and Hyundai,btohqsg
The prices for the cars brought in for that lot were 140k for the rwd and 170k for awd,btohqsg
With COE. 50 units were brought in,btohqsg
But this was sold as more of a subscription model for the project,btohqsg
the style is so original. much better looking than many Japanese ones,btohqsg
Ioniq5 available for refundable booking now for 500  delivery early next yr made in sg factory. Available for test drive at kmc,btohqsg
But coe should still be bad. But no harm put 500 for a queue if current car is due to change and wanted to venture to ev. No other details now for pricing  this it‚Äôs fully refundable,btohqsg
Refundable booking? Then everyone would dash to book,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still perplexed why they wanna set up factory in singapore,btohqsg
Good eh near my house everyday can go there kaypoh,btohqsg
Smart. How many hours a day does one spend driving vs how many hours one enjoys the house with his loved ones? I‚Äôd rather nice house anytime over nice car.,btohqsg
Exactly. Not much left perhaps but what is important is there is value retention in what he invests in (plus capital gain and rental potential) vs definite depreciation year on year for cars.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what my se told me. Anyway I just put first Loh. ü§≠,btohqsg
This would also be a smart buy. Drive for ‚Äúfree‚Äù with the value going up,btohqsg
No   and I am sad they don‚Äôt want let me see Thier nice car interior,btohqsg
Then  how come they can be on the road roaming around? They give Kopi money to TP or LTA officers?,btohqsg
Wah sensitive la   I think is lack of enforcement,btohqsg
When they get stopped for a check the tints are measured but many are not illegal as well,btohqsg
There's a limit to how much one can tint  and many of them still follow as they don't want the fine,btohqsg
He meant those very dark 1 sure fail 1,btohqsg
Yah Hahahaa. Lots of cars install dark tints too ‚Ä¶ Swee lah‚Ä¶ just remove before inspection  and run the risk of failing random LTA checks lor,btohqsg
Just.. don‚Äôt cry and complain and blame government for getting an inspection notice when rules are clear?,btohqsg
I wonder how come they allow to import and install onto the windows of these cars by workshop in the first place?,btohqsg
My friend got one when he went back to his car after lunch üòÖ,btohqsg
Because the limits for front and back tints different and the film is the same  so just put the back one up front,btohqsg
dark dark is good for nite outings into quiet corners at night.,btohqsg
So boring be like me use clear tint,btohqsg
You say one ah  later everyone here come stand outside your car to see see üôà,btohqsg
I‚Äôve seen nice continental all dark! Can‚Äôt see the driver and passengers. Like those drug cartel boss or hitman.,btohqsg
Reallly I just did mine 4 month ago   and I choose the most clear 1,btohqsg
look more premium . the window will reflect like glasses,btohqsg
No wor I think my tint more atas,btohqsg
Can hanky panky in the car under broad day light! Hahaha,btohqsg
I need go and take a sexy photo of my clear tint,btohqsg
Now no need tints loh‚Ä¶ many cars put full window sunshades also end up same effect üòâüòâ,btohqsg
Can see the blue tint is so sexy,btohqsg
Maybe these cars are driven by vampires  scared of sunlight.,btohqsg
