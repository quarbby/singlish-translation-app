waht are your thoughts of girls pampering their partner,btohqsg
yes because only the A mattersOther grades aren't important 😂,btohqsg
that is true. but calculus actually has a use in engineering.,btohqsg
when u want to calculate the motion of the stars for some random reasons 😂,btohqsg
I m convinced computer scientists came up with negative weights for fun,btohqsg
the key to learning all these isn't about the applications,btohqsg
investment banks hire engineers not for their calculus skills,btohqsg
hmm how'd investment banks hire den,btohqsg
I'm more curious about the process of hiring,btohqsg
who do they decide is worth,btohqsg
if ur the child of their owner/founder,btohqsg
if u want the application side of informatics,btohqsg
the problem is that most real world stuff are np-hard,btohqsg
but informatics gives u some heuristics ideas,btohqsg
would you go to try those if ur nt going into research,btohqsg
u can go do google hash code,btohqsg
those qns p much show how informatics ideas r used for real life problems,btohqsg
I was consideringbut I tried cf some time ago n was like :,btohqsg
"""Diva receives an array as a gift""",btohqsg
I thought they were the same haha,btohqsg
ok tourist can't AK it then,btohqsg
R u in cs or wat,btohqsg
and ur basically trying to maximise ur gains,btohqsg
ull be the cursed sight in 2 months,btohqsg
Do u love this sorta problem statements,btohqsg
look it's not that difficult or wat but,btohqsg
do u rly like reading them,btohqsg
thats not even hard to read...,btohqsg
at least its not a story,btohqsg
Ya the story is the worst one,btohqsg
Please give me an array as my Christmas gift,btohqsg
but i prefer that to just directly asking the qn,btohqsg
At 1035pm people alr not happy,btohqsg
Then u give us some retarded statement,btohqsg
if u want just the problem,btohqsg
then itll be like sch qns,btohqsg
"Then there are schizophrenic people like ""rar the cat""",btohqsg
u not old enuf to get the joke,btohqsg
Those r the problem authors and they have their own inside jokes,btohqsg
Maybe one day I will get a cat,btohqsg
I think it's a nush thing?,btohqsg
Oh ya the best problem statement I've found,btohqsg
is actl a simp problem statement bruh,btohqsg
the way i rmbr that qn even tho i did it in 2019,btohqsg
Important!! Only for that first job,btohqsg
it determines the type of paper that is gonna earn that seat on the interview table for your first job,btohqsg
Employers dont just look at your grades  but the impt thing is to have something for them to look at other than ur grades,btohqsg
I sacrificed a lot of things for this,btohqsg
Every second feels so painful to study or lose,btohqsg
I nvr do yet. maybe hard leh,btohqsg
Just came out of the amath exam hall,btohqsg
Ok no this one is def not if im an acads pro i m in ri,btohqsg
She did her A lvl math in 30 minutes hor,btohqsg
If not how to get A in a lvl,btohqsg
pls dun take me srsly to those who r looking!,btohqsg
It's time to take H4 like@chemcer,btohqsg
too bad he can't do Lorentz transformation,btohqsg
I am about to take psle,btohqsg
PLS DONT REMIND ME OF THAT,btohqsg
Gonna go ham on these kids,btohqsg
its been over for 3 days,btohqsg
and ive never felt happier for 3 days,btohqsg
I don’t understand the quantum mechanics question,btohqsg
you know how to excite electrons,btohqsg
my H2 chem grades were like,btohqsg
is that actually how to excite electrons?,btohqsg
is that hving to do w resonance n stuff? lol,btohqsg
nope  chem resonance is part of orjanic,btohqsg
Physical resonance will make the electrons excited,btohqsg
We never really touch each other,btohqsg
Solve for natural frequency of electron by solving 26th-order DE 😎😎😎,btohqsg
a lot of your atomic structure in chem is derived from physics,btohqsg
that shit is all phys LOL,btohqsg
but eh im not sure dont u guys touch it in QM,btohqsg
Everything is made of empty space,btohqsg
i think u touch it in QM2?,btohqsg
maybe QM1 already touch it lol,btohqsg
your head your family your life is all made of tiny empty space,btohqsg
This one i agree my head is made up of empty space,btohqsg
i just rmb my first QM class in uni,btohqsg
they went through hydrogen atom in detail,btohqsg
That means your brain is empty,btohqsg
You ain’t thinking you are reacting,btohqsg
no. get out. F = dp/dt,btohqsg
Pls tell me whats the light dependent stage of photosynthesis,btohqsg
i gave up bio after sec 2,btohqsg
my mom scolded me for not knowing what it is lol,btohqsg
yea she took 30mins to explain to me citric acid cycle and i couldnt understand ANYTHING,btohqsg
rate is directly proportional to intensity(concentration) of light,btohqsg
so you guys like to memorize things like this so much?,btohqsg
STIMULATE ZE ELECTRONS IN THE PIGMENTS OF LIGHT HARVESTING COMPLEX OF PS2.,btohqsg
physics for people like me with shit memory,btohqsg
not possible. u have to memorize MI table oso,btohqsg
r u rly gonna derive the MI of every single object on the spot,btohqsg
r u srsly gonna triple integrate every fucking thing?,btohqsg
Yupp I love integrating into society,btohqsg
they give it to me lol like,btohqsg
uni isn't gonna throw us questions that require us to memorise,btohqsg
they deduct our marks with the difficulty of the question  not based on how good our memory is of a formula,btohqsg
im curious  in calc mods  for things like laplace transform are u given the table even,btohqsg
we often times get a 2 sided A4 paper that we can write anything on,btohqsg
Not if you memorise the answer,btohqsg
later they give dyanmic system eqn how,btohqsg
ig u can put that in calc mods oso,btohqsg
so it's like we have our own cheat sheet,btohqsg
"no need to ever see another ""transform""  ever again",btohqsg
Gonna pull down the bell curve slay,btohqsg
I saw a lot of people on Reddit not finishing the paper,btohqsg
I didn't sit for the paper but lol,btohqsg
i just wanna see the paper lol,btohqsg
r u rly rly wanting to triple integrate everything,btohqsg
9 formulas for u to memorize,btohqsg
anyway i rmb when i took the mod that used it,btohqsg
"the question is like ""The moment of intertia for xx shape is given as xxx""",btohqsg
bruh wtf we aint given that shit,btohqsg
ok but tbf memorizing 9 formulas isnt vv difficult tho,btohqsg
i mean  they test us on how we can use the info to solve  not whether we can rmb said info,btohqsg
a lot of people even when given the MI,btohqsg
either ways you give me MI dont give me MI i also cannot solve,btohqsg
gib me ur orjanic kemistry skill,btohqsg
i can give you physics skill,btohqsg
my lecture made me question whether i have any,btohqsg
I wrote all this without understanding shit,btohqsg
ouhh no crystal field theory ah,btohqsg
this msg was sent to me,btohqsg
why do i think of physics,btohqsg
why do I think of you,btohqsg
u wan me pm u scolding HAHAHA,btohqsg
You perverted masochist!!! (BTW is that the scolding u wanted),btohqsg
Eh wtf u r actually masochistic,btohqsg
do u rly want to become a failure like me? if not study!,btohqsg
Music more like 90rp flying away from u,btohqsg
Oh no spare me the vision,btohqsg
you act like it was originally with him,btohqsg
Go study u failure  ur cousin get 1 for L1r5 last year y u cannot,btohqsg
Sorry I don’t want to be a failure like the Physics H3 god,btohqsg
If u dw study j dont lor,btohqsg
If u still cant understand why u shld be studying,btohqsg
Hais how y’all gonna be Asian parents,btohqsg
Its too late for u anyw,btohqsg
i sat back row so not possible,btohqsg
CS and engineering people all zombies,btohqsg
hii yall  how to revise for pure chem?? tmr is paper 2 and i feel like im not ready,btohqsg
i think bright culture o level got good resources i think,btohqsg
It's ok I will stick to my anal chem,btohqsg
If that's a concern then clean room or no go,btohqsg
I don't work clean room so it's ok,btohqsg
Imagine gowning and air shower all the time,btohqsg
High 70s is likely self estimated.There are typically presentation errors that many students would have missed out  that would result in more marks deducted.,btohqsg
I waiting for Os to be over before I throw out my yearly AMA on reddit,btohqsg
Anyone got a math paper 1 solutions and pdf ?,btohqsg
Agree. They think same end ans = full marks which need not be the case.,btohqsg
My tutee last year did not finish 20+ marks of qn also got A,btohqsg
But his quality of work for those qn he can do is good. Presentation is precise and detailed type. So i think securing A is more on those standard qn u got to really do them really nicely and well.Difficult  qn  well many people will also find them difficult so you might not lose out so much,btohqsg
this is not true  your friend may have calculated high 70s  but he probably did not count careless. I got 67% overall (i recorded my final ans in calculator) and even gave myself some method marks for the qns i got wrong and still got an A last year.,btohqsg
thrs still method marks i think unless its part abcd then if ur part a wrong gg,btohqsg
anybody taking pol sci or real estate here,btohqsg
hii have a headacheand it does not go away easilysonap  wake up early orpush on (helps la tmr chem paper idk what to do),btohqsg
i learn something new every day,btohqsg
but they have their own accent and slang,btohqsg
Wah idk how to teach text lmao,btohqsg
You want canto go listen to Hong Kong show,btohqsg
Lol I can speak but idk how to type it,btohqsg
Note that the j is y sound again,btohqsg
this means kid in written hokkien,btohqsg
usually people put 死  in front to say darned,btohqsg
lol idk how its pronounced in chi,btohqsg
i only know that is gin in hokkien LOL,btohqsg
ur hokkien parents would have called u ‘gin a’ before,btohqsg
its used like 是 in cantonese,btohqsg
lol easiest way for me is to just use handwriting,btohqsg
in hokkien u can type 肖查某 to call someone crazy,btohqsg
i need to search some more words in minnan,btohqsg
but in hokkien they call it bo,btohqsg
tw dictionary exists for me  HAHAHA,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to do this ?,btohqsg
tbh hokkien pronunciation of ants is so weird tho,btohqsg
in chinese its ma yi but they call it gao ya in hokkien,btohqsg
its 狗蚁 in written hokkien uh,btohqsg
If you read that in canto it's a fun short tongue twister,btohqsg
Faan is similar to mandarin fan but it's like dragged out slightly,btohqsg
Idk canto main thing is like the tones,btohqsg
hokkien has 8 tones just saying,btohqsg
i did read up on dialects and apparently hokkien has tone changes (tone sandhis) depending on the location of the word within the sentence,btohqsg
a lot of the dialects are very similar to other non chinese languages funnily enough,btohqsg
man i forgot how to count in teochew i have to ask my relatives how to do so 😭😭,btohqsg
And slowly learnt how to speak it,btohqsg
lol my dad's side is hokkien  mum side teochew but i know cantonese the best,btohqsg
tbh people usually say cantonese is easier though,btohqsg
Wa Chua gin na bo simt??,btohqsg
Reading hokkien when those is so weird,btohqsg
why did i read simt as sim tiao,btohqsg
knowing cantonese made learning Thai way easier for me i think,btohqsg
like i tried learning but i just cant LOL,btohqsg
i only know the v basics,btohqsg
tbf it's how i started learning,btohqsg
This means I bring the kids go to tuition,btohqsg
tbh i cant rly distinguish the tones in hokkien,btohqsg
It's something I hear in my childhood a lot hehehe,btohqsg
wa chua gina ki bo sit,btohqsg
i think u missed out the ki,btohqsg
i'm happy with being blur in my family convos when they talk in hokkien,btohqsg
i don't need to be engaged in convo,btohqsg
well best is to act blur,btohqsg
thing is my grandfather is fully capable of speaking some english,btohqsg
Like Idw to participate in your conversation,btohqsg
Mines fully able to speak Chinese but they prefer speaking hokkien,btohqsg
if it's important for me to know  they'll tell me,btohqsg
anyway my grandfather is TCM  so it's almost always about,btohqsg
how i'm eating too heaty food,btohqsg
once u hear more u’ll naturally be familiar with the pronunciation,btohqsg
I thought TCM stand for the cocomelon,btohqsg
你甘知影阮 idk how to go on,btohqsg
itsokay i oso dont understand HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
i have learned so many languages like half ass hahaha,btohqsg
I don't understand written hokkien only like spoken ones yea,btohqsg
if you put a bit of time,btohqsg
the 5th word is our and then like the first 2 just means did you,btohqsg
nah korean is like you learn the alphabet and you can pronounce literally anything,btohqsg
then 3rd and 4th is know,btohqsg
you realise the Korean king created their current alphabet cos they used to use chinese,btohqsg
if i pronounce its li gam zai ya wun  …,btohqsg
So Chinese it the superior languages,btohqsg
Chinese is hard if you don't grow up with it,btohqsg
every character in korean is just one syllable,btohqsg
Man... I didn't grow up with Chinese,btohqsg
i learnt some basic words but idk how to form sentences,btohqsg
i tried to learn like French in sec 1,btohqsg
i only know how to form 1 sentence,btohqsg
I know how to introduce myself in korean,btohqsg
Sigh I gotta go and study 😭,btohqsg
i thought u knew how to introduce yourself,btohqsg
i don't dare speak dialect to people lol,btohqsg
Like I legit no drive to study the whole day,btohqsg
Before last week I can go on and on but wtf now,btohqsg
meanwhile my friend took one class of German in uni and dared to have convos with locals,btohqsg
this is the reason why i dont rmbr yr name :D,btohqsg
when I went Europe for grad trip  i got exposed to so much german that i did pick up a fair bit,btohqsg
like some words are hard not to learn,btohqsg
esp cos so much of Europe uses German,btohqsg
u think i can read tht,btohqsg
I took a 4 hour train ride from Zurich to Stuttgart and spent it reading on how to read,btohqsg
A shit-The mass of an atom compared to 1/12 a carbon-¹² atom,btohqsg
i'm damn poor after my grad trip lol,btohqsg
does anyone here play world of tanks blitz LOL yet to find anyone frm sg,btohqsg
yea 90% of the ppl ik used to 😢,btohqsg
Oh wow didnt realise its 11.35 alr,btohqsg
I still haven't done my revision done A level,btohqsg
my hand shake whenever i hold the micropipette sia,btohqsg
then i fill up the wells always kena overflow,btohqsg
ok next time i eat white only,btohqsg
i consume pure caffeine from distillation set up at home,btohqsg
i love egg white but sometimes the york kinda scares me,btohqsg
so i just try to stomach it 😭,btohqsg
ye ye  we practise titration by turning the shower tap also,btohqsg
for a second i didnt get it until i realise burette has the stupid stopper,btohqsg
that i always forget to check before i fill in my solution,btohqsg
got check air column at the tip before titration? xD,btohqsg
my sec school burette was the rubber tubing one   hate that shit,btohqsg
i 1st shift but i don't trust whoever cleaned the apparatus so i always wash,btohqsg
aiya just lose the accuracy mark HAHAHAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
i mean wtv i got the value that was close to what everyone else got,btohqsg
yk my friend’s pipette was spoilt for the VA,btohqsg
where all the bio pract people sia,btohqsg
so he had to roughly chug the reagent into the conical flash 😭,btohqsg
i might wanna get one to play with it,btohqsg
but i havent check the price 😭,btohqsg
i destroyed the pipette filler  the solution went inside then my whole pipette turned brown,btohqsg
my pipette filler keep coming out 😭,btohqsg
like it was loose so like when i was taking the pipette stuff the pipette filler fell off 😭,btohqsg
like my prelim i had a fking trash stopwatch,btohqsg
like when i press it doesnt start,btohqsg
i had to press a few times for it to start 😭😭😭😭,btohqsg
AND IT JUST HAPPENED THAT I POIR THE SOLUTION THEN I REALISE THE STOPWATCH GOT PROBLEM,btohqsg
technically we just do 5 oscillations then x6,btohqsg
usually 30 ah cos my cher say must be >20s for the total time of oscillations,btohqsg
my physics pract was lowkey fucked but its okay ig its over,btohqsg
physics practical was so mundane tho,btohqsg
i had such a high percentage error for 1 of the qns 😭,btohqsg
just wing the stuff around only 😭,btohqsg
p sure i got shit string one time,btohqsg
like wtf kind of shit ass string,btohqsg
physics is fun to learn conceptually,btohqsg
but a lot of people can't handle when you get into the details,btohqsg
i forgot whats dynamics help 😭😭,btohqsg
i just know the terms and all,btohqsg
i remember my uni year 1 sem 2,btohqsg
a past year midterm had an exact same question as my H2 physics prelim lol,btohqsg
that one not safe  but confirm A bruh,btohqsg
im jus praying for my gp,btohqsg
70% of my prayers gg to gp LMAO,btohqsg
i know 1 guy somehow for 1 chem paper MCQ his first 20 questions all correct then last 10 all wrongcan't tell if he did it on purpose,btohqsg
lol 10% to the entire PCM,btohqsg
i write halfway then i doubt myself then i just stare at the paper,btohqsg
legend  get 1 wrong 1 correct alternate,btohqsg
bc my gp grades are the worst compared to the rest of my subjects,btohqsg
like no matter how hard i try i cant do well in that subj,btohqsg
I DO ESSAY PLANS AND MANY P2s,btohqsg
i feel like i have learnt nothing after 2 years,btohqsg
i feel like i wanna rot my brain cells bc of gp,btohqsg
i lost 50% of my braincells,btohqsg
GP i just went in and whack,btohqsg
THATS WHY 70% TO PRAY FOR GP,btohqsg
then the essay can have a lot of ticks then the score like 25/50,btohqsg
I went from E to B oso,btohqsg
anyone here took the zoo compre a level paper,btohqsg
imagine preparing like science tech politicals environment then bam  zoo,btohqsg
the AQ my cher gave me a 4 😭,btohqsg
AQ is out of what again,btohqsg
idk how realistic it is to hit a C for gp,btohqsg
what even was my GP paper lol,btohqsg
like im forever stuck with a D so ig,btohqsg
go in with no expectations 😭,btohqsg
i did improve from an E la but,btohqsg
then prelims i wanted to improve but still stuck at D,btohqsg
tbh 2018 aq seems the toughest for me,btohqsg
cos its like they just take a quote from the passage rather than benefits / problems / solution,btohqsg
i’ve been doing the prelims one though,btohqsg
SAQ is the part that carries me tbh,btohqsg
like literally got a 12 for saq !!!,btohqsg
i fell to an 11 in prelims la but ig inconsistency,btohqsg
i improved from promos to mye mainly bc of saq LMAO,btohqsg
like i jump from 6/17 to 12/17,btohqsg
cos i somehow understood how to do it at one pt,btohqsg
Maybe voluntarily retaining would’ve helped I went from last yr GP promos only (not overall) 42 to this year 67,btohqsg
i just woke up at 10pm bruh,btohqsg
aish but D to A is such a dream,btohqsg
i need to make it happen bro 💀💀,btohqsg
i feel like getting an A for gp is like smth i can only dream,btohqsg
sleep at 4am  wake up at 6+ then go do paper  leave at 12pm  come back nap until like don't know when,btohqsg
i did 12 - 5am memorise syllabus,btohqsg
5 - 6am sleep wake up go for exam,btohqsg
idk i got straight Us to passing most subs,btohqsg
i cant even wake myself early,btohqsg
i’ve been waking up at 9 lately,btohqsg
its okay tho because i still could wake up for pract,btohqsg
i slept at 2am for my chem shift 1  it's fine  can wake up one,btohqsg
I better not see some yeast,btohqsg
all my prac this year all got potato sia,btohqsg
mine this year was green bean,btohqsg
YALL ARE MAKING FOOD PRODUCTION SIA,btohqsg
oh but on hindsight i made boba with chem stuff,btohqsg
like u can read up on the sodium alginate and calcium thing,btohqsg
i rly need to sleep at this pt,btohqsg
can cellulose even be broken down,btohqsg
By the power of Mother Nature,btohqsg
L sia EJ paper this year come out crab cycle,btohqsg
i’ve been seeing NADH so many times 😭😭,btohqsg
i see bio and chem having a collab,btohqsg
oh yes the electrochem qn right,btohqsg
either ways not like im gonna do phy bio and chem in uni,btohqsg
Gude no promoting of h2 bio in sgexams chat,btohqsg
aiyo prac only  i'll just get 90%+ for other components,btohqsg
bio prac like anything under the sky lol,btohqsg
ngl lowkey i won't be surprised sia,btohqsg
my jae friends told me to don't ever try predict cambridge,btohqsg
ehhh confirm won't have lah  running that shit will destroy all the watches and the devices,btohqsg
Oscillate this fly that you chopped up,btohqsg
Laplace transform to solve for the flys frequency,btohqsg
eh we talk shit so much then later legit something damn wack actually come out lmao,btohqsg
later the experiment is some chem concepts,btohqsg
the only weird thing was the burette lor,btohqsg
i just realised my name can become bill-rete 💀💀💀💀,btohqsg
