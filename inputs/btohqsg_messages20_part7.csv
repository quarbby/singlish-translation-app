It won't be cancelled because what u read is long ago policy,btohqsg
In 2022 they already ans this,btohqsg
Those unsold units will be pushed to sbf or obf,btohqsg
SBF and then if still have remaining to OBF,btohqsg
I think you just submit all your income statements. Should be able to get some grant‚Ä¶,btohqsg
If got constant CPF contribution then will have grant. Do your HLE first,btohqsg
As long as u summited what is needed then no issue.,btohqsg

So total how much flat supply is there? 2016?,btohqsg
Starting is correct.639 first timers are guaranteed a number within supply.33 second timers are guaranteed a number within supply.HDB gives up to 300% of available units. Aka 672 x 3 = 2016 (naturally 672 within supply)Assuming there are less than 2016 total applications  everyone will receive a queue number.If they are more than 2016 applications  there will be people who don't receive a queue number at all.if there are more than 639 first timers  the rest will get a number outside of supply. Same for 2nd timer number.Hope this explains,btohqsg
Actually this is the full message thatSebastianandLam890are sharing a screenshot of,btohqsg
In this scenario there are 672 units,btohqsg
Hi  first timer BTO applicant here  just curious about this. So if queue numbers amounting to 300% of the number of units are issued  does it mean that I could get a queue number but it's so far behind that I won't get any units to choose from?,btohqsg
Yes  also there is also possibility that even you are within the supply but the ethnic quota run out,btohqsg
Over subscribed LoR like the Dec woodland bto,btohqsg
Regarding this pls see the below. Theoretically ethnic quota should not run out within supply,btohqsg
"responding to this  and@papa_smurfy's taghaha. sorry for the late reply!in theorytheoretically  ethnic quota can run out when queue numbers are still within supply. after all  think about this hypothetical scenario: there are 100 flats  with 25 slots for M/I/O. if fewer than 25 M/I/O apply  there's no way that we can have all the M/I/O slots filled. so a C applicant whose queue number is within supply  is not guaranteed of a flat.in practicethat said for BTO  ethnic quota has never run out while within supply.so it has long been suspected that (1) EIP proportions are already applied during the balloting stage for those within supply  and (2) there has always been enough applicants from each ethnicity to 'fill up' these within-supply slots.S/N 2 is an important point because it implies that if this criteria is not met  ethnic quota may run out within supply - just that it hasn't happened yet. so while@DuNn0wHyis right thatethnic quota has never run out technicallywe can't apply this to future projects and say that it will ""never run out"". it's also why theblogsites that @raynertanxw mentionedare not wrong when they say that ethnic quota still applies within supply.HDB's responsegiven that HDB has never been explicit about the above in any of their public comms  i initially thought they would never officially commit to saying anything about it. so i'm actually quite surprised that they actually saidwhat they said to you @raynertanxwhaha. i guess this means that specifically for Rail Green I/II 4R  the above two criteria were met.what we can't say anything about  is whether these criteria were met for the other flat types of Rail Green I/II  and/or other past/ongoing projects. like i mentioned  HDB has never been explicit about this  and hence the officer who replied to@raynertanxwprobably crafted his email carefully with this in mind.what this means for uslike i always say  past patterns don't foretell future events - they can only be used as a gauge. but if one finds comfort seeking some level of certainty in historical data  then as a rule of thumbif you're within supply for BTO  there's no need to worry.read more here  under FAQ #3.",btohqsg
I feel it might be a rather rare case but I actually saw it occur so ymmv,btohqsg
Hello  how to check if I‚Äôm under MCPS or public scheme ?,btohqsg
You should be able to know through your invitation package when you get your selection appt - if you see the documents require your parents' IC  then your queue number is through MCPS,btohqsg
Am I able to opt out of the MCPS during selection?,btohqsg
I'm not sure about this  if anyone has experience do share! If not  best to check with HDB about thisBut my 2 cents: I would guess cannot  as your ballot result might have been due to the MCPS extra ballot chance.,btohqsg
Got one article on a couple who managed to opt out of MCPS previously (8 years ago though)https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/queue-numbers-of-applicants-who-withdraw-from-hdb-priority-schemes-will-be-re,btohqsg
Wow that's very interesting  thanks for sharing!,btohqsg
Think that's a fair system if it's still in place,btohqsg
Actually if the parents just keep quiet and don't say anything  will hdb be so free to go check whether the parents got stay there?,btohqsg
Oh ok nvm I know already. Silly qns,btohqsg
They will know if the parents change address. Their system linked with IRAS and ICA. But whether they bother to follow up is up to them. üòÅ,btohqsg
hi  for the HFE letter if apply and dont exercise (ie apply for bto/resale) will there be any repercussions? like get a black mark or be deprioritised? and if it expires and you reapply/or dont reapply will there be any downsides?,btohqsg
also it assesses your prior 12mth cpf contribution right? what if one only contributed 9-10mths of the prior 12mths?,btohqsg
To my knowledge  no repercussions for not utilising it or needing to reapply,btohqsg
Then just provide what you can. They will assess it,btohqsg
No repercussions if you don‚Äôt use it within the validity period (9 months for now  usual 6 months validity),btohqsg
Just be aware it's in fact 14months prior application  -2 months when you apply,btohqsg
During application you will be able to select if you wish to opt in for the FPPS  MCPS or MGPS,btohqsg
And provide data while you apply such as parents address  doctor memo etc for the relevant schemes,btohqsg
yes  but u may not be successful in these schemes. and even if mcps successful  maybe the q number is not gotten from mcps,btohqsg
so if i only have contribution since feb 2023 they just take feb-dec if i apply in jan 2024? or -2mths feb -oct 2023 if i apply in jan 2024?,btohqsg
so many acronyms. what do they mean? so i just select all the schemes and see which they allocate in the hfe?,btohqsg
If apply in Jan 24  - 2 so ur 12mon period starts from Nov 24 to Nov 23,btohqsg
if apply jan 24 enough time for feb 24 bto? 12mths nov 22 - nov 23 if only feb 23 - nov 23 will be captured and got cpf contribution means gg? may as well not apply?,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm interested in Bishan Ridge. The ballot period has ended in 2020. How should I proceed from now?,btohqsg
see if sbf or obf have,btohqsg
sbf will be same price as bto?,btohqsg
To account for the reduction in building time,btohqsg
When will they inform u if u are eligible for the married / with kids priority scheme? Like still under public scheme lei,btohqsg
hi! asking for a friend - does hdb account for part time job and pay towards bto application (as 12-month work cycle) and EHG if hes a fresh grad? his fiance is unemployed.thanks!,btohqsg
Yes  and they will assume the same salary even if the applicant only worked 1 out of 12 months - they will assume monthly salary based on that one month alone  not √∑12,btohqsg
