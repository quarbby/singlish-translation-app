🎉Pika World Bite-Size Update – 16 June 2022🎉🧨The Fed Took a Bold Move🛎It’s all over the news. First  the Fed decided to raise the interest rate by 0.75%  pushing the range of 1.5% to 1.75%. It is by far the most significant increase since 1994 as it works to tame the inflation at a 40-year high.The Ukraine war is hurting food and energy prices  while the lockdown in China is exacerbating supply-chain woes. Uncle Powell hammered through the message that another 0.75% hike in July is possible if inflation data remains elevated.😍Markets Cheers on Certainty🌴A sense of relief came when he commented that the rate increase of 0.75% was not a “common” scene. With the action and guidance provided  there is lesser tension and more visibility of the Fed’s course of action. This allows market participants to return to the equity market and takes some heat off the selling pressure.💊Is raising inflation an antidote🧸Pika World maintains the stance that dark clouds are still on the horizon. First  the reduction of the balance sheet and the aggressive rate hike are double combo tightening. While a critical reason for slower growth is a high inflation situation that eats into consumers' and businesses' spending  Pika World believes that a higher rate will not have a powerful effect to reduce demand on demand for inelastic items  in particular  food and energy.Moreover  we continue to see home prices rising despite the demand falling  giving a higher mortgage rate. Hence  the downside risk is stagnation  when growth falters and inflation persists. Ultimately  this raises the odds of a recession by driving credit costs upwards and pushing risk asset prices.⏰The Fed is aware of higher inflation ahead🔦Talking about guidance  one cannot ignore the new economic projections. The Fed raises its inflation forecasts but is confident that prices can fall back to the 2% target by 2024. There is also a cut of its GDP through 2024  and there is still a sign of growth where it sees the unemployment rate rising to 4.1% in 2024.On the dot plot  FOMC members are seeing interest rates going to 3.4% by the end of the year. Hence  this may hint at another 1.75% rate hike for the remaining 4 meetings.Overall  Pika World remains cautiously pessimistic on the path ahead while we wait for more economic data to support a peaking inflation narrative.It is 16 June  Thursday  9.25 am in Singapore and 9.25pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a spending and wonderful day ahead!,btohqsg
