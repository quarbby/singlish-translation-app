Everyone got their own bias once they are vested la,btohqsg
Just like people talk loh don't need defend one la,btohqsg
Even if you outalk them doesn't mean the stock will go up also,btohqsg
Uob again.. Hahah they already malu on starburst liao,btohqsg

Wa tomorrow Oceanus will go up,btohqsg
I just think risk is high,btohqsg
For it to go up to $0.02.. market cap is $50 million,btohqsg
This is what I meanWhen directors sell all say small issue won't drop oneWhen directors buy impression that it confirm will go up,btohqsg
From $0.016 to $0.02 only 4 pips,btohqsg
See how much you want that 4 pips loh,btohqsg
I feel it is not worth $500 million,btohqsg
I sold my 500k shares make $1500,btohqsg
Buy and sell is nothing one la,btohqsg
I think better donâ€™t touch. Wait pay back,btohqsg
But as retailers we definitely prefer directors buying than selling la,btohqsg

But won't drastically affect the stock price as one would imagine,btohqsg
Actually if u read uob KH writeup on JT  they are expecting Q4 to should a profit of Rmb125m. (87.5/0.41),btohqsg

When price up they wonâ€™t sell again ...,btohqsg
At least we share the same concern. First thing before I buy is ask....is the company worth so much as per mkt cap. Then see the earnings n upside potentials. Of course  shares will overshoot both ways in the short term.,btohqsg
When times are bad every man for himself Liao,btohqsg
