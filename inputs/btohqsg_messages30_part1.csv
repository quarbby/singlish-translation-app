is HLE a need to apply now? or only after ballot?,btohqsg
Yes. Problem arise when no children or cannot buy over ex spouse share because of financial reason,btohqsg
I think if you are applying for a new bto. Then you need to have a hfe to apply. No more hle form ( this is valid a few year back..now it's just HFE from),btohqsg
I see! Ok means HDB will inform us to apply for a updated HLE before we get the keys. Oh man..will take note to make sure same number,btohqsg
I used my hfe to apply sbf,btohqsg
Then no need hle already. Nowadays it is just HFE. No more hle,btohqsg
Normally w children  divorced one party will takeover and stay w children that's why either one of the parents must be able to finance the house.,btohqsg
For example my cpf and loan alone can support my 4rm BTO already  i no need my wife cpf . Then if i become divorce then i can retain my HDB with my sons if my wife give permission over to hdb that i can use my sons name to this BTO.Of course vice versa,btohqsg
How about ur wife? Can she support to buy over ur share alone?,btohqsg
Hi  I actually wrote in to HDB to check but they replied saying that we are ineligible as it requires both of us to have graduated within 12 months.Maybe is denial but Iâ€™ve seen people online in similar situations appeal for DIA during signing of lease. Does anyone have any similar experience recently or have they clamped down on this.,btohqsg
normally how long hdb reply to you? I wrote in almost 2 weeks back still no response,btohqsg
It was v fast  response within a day or two,btohqsg
But maybe my question also v clear cut  asking about my eligibility for DIA,btohqsg
submitted recently or long time back?,btohqsg
Can be done if either party can support to buy over,btohqsg
Yes. Coz normally wife wants the child custody,btohqsg
If husband can give permission then good,btohqsg
Hahaha only if your wife ok  if she is not okGo to court case  usually kids and house will go to mum ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
You are just waiting for key collection right that applied years back (HLE),btohqsg
Yes must end in good terms ma,btohqsg
Then the loan amount all those will be same as stated in HLE ah,btohqsg
Unless you have major pay raise or valid reason for reassessment,btohqsg
But that was years ago. So HDB assume we still have similar income? Lol no need to worry we cannot pay off?,btohqsg
This is part I thought its vague. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Can your downpayment plus loan amount cover the unit price? If yes they likely wonâ€™t ask you to submit present income docs. If no  they will ask for it and reassess your loan quantum.,btohqsg
But wouldnt be surprise if they don't reassess  because you are supposed to exercise prudency when choosing an estate  to only choose within means.,btohqsg
I guess thatâ€™s true as wellâ€¦,btohqsg
Any shortfall must pay in cash.,btohqsg
I guess so too. If no need to do HLE..also save some fuss. No need submit stuff etc again ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Result out since last year Dec.,btohqsg
Your balloting results and other people balloting results different meh,btohqsg
hi  anyone can recommend an affordable digital lock? current 11yr old Yale lock is dying.. want an affordable one to use for few years before moving,btohqsg
Hello anyone bought private property before and then wanna buy hdb  is there any chance to not do the waiting period,btohqsg
You can try appealing to HDB.,btohqsg
Will drag until next launch meh?,btohqsg
I think around 2 months after launch will have results. So Feb results will be out in April / May. So those that didnâ€™t get Q number or Q outside supply can apply HFE in time for the next launch.Next launch is July.,btohqsg
They probably missed the results date then blurblur until now,btohqsg
Even if they didnâ€™t get queue number HDB will inform them  so they probably missed or something,btohqsg
u need to appeal very hard and high chance hdb wouldnâ€™t care,btohqsg
If you are aged 55 and above  you no need to wait out 15 months to buy resale HDB,btohqsg
If not  unless it is due to financial difficulties(even sell condo also canâ€™t cover kind)  very slim chance HDB will approve your appeal.,btohqsg
Yea seems no way around it,btohqsg
Cos actually is my parents bought under my name last time,btohqsg
So not really my house and I don't get proceeds,btohqsg
...then why you let them put under your name?,btohqsg
You got absolutely nothing to gain + now waste your time,btohqsg
Then you stay there cannot meh? Since itâ€™s technically your house,btohqsg
Sold cos don't want the mortgage,btohqsg
hello  bros  may I ask the price for prime BTO. Is if after the subsidy or before the 9% subsidy. Thank you!,btohqsg
I think the list prices usually show before any subsidies  if there are subsidies they'll be stated,btohqsg
