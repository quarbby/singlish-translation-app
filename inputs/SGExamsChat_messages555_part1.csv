letâ€™s say rite after I grad then I work as intern,btohqsg
can I like get my uni offer and differ for 1 year,btohqsg
cos one of my mentors is like doing intern now to see if she rlly want to do lab work,btohqsg
sheâ€™s in nus she didnâ€™t apply this year,btohqsg
i think intern is a valid reason no?,btohqsg
no this is not like ur mandatory intern,btohqsg
itâ€™s like after the intern for poly they offer to keep you for another yesh,btohqsg
like they give u job offer,btohqsg
so itâ€™s sort of like a gap year,btohqsg
and what's the benefit to the uni to reserve the place for you,btohqsg
nvm it was a honest question,btohqsg
the reason for my question and answer is:When you want another party to accede to your request  there must be some benefit usually,btohqsg
Asking if there is such a thing,btohqsg
which has already been pointed out that there isnâ€™t,btohqsg
if u get what I mean  then you get it. It's ok ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
you can LOA i believe if you just go in but they might just ask you to reapply in +1 year  of course it's a risk la if lets say the IGP goes up then you happened to get caught outside of it,btohqsg
ya best to email the admission dept,btohqsg
these kind of thing dont play with fire and ask reddit/tele,btohqsg
seriously why not just do an industrial attachment during uni,btohqsg
ya just dont ask reddit/tele without emailing cause its quite impt,btohqsg
but what you rly want is a gap year while they 'reserve' your slot right? what i can suggest is you go in 1 year then 2nd year or something you LOA  it's a very common approach,btohqsg
then you don't have to worry about risking your admission or something,btohqsg
unless you're saying that 'oh i wanna test water first before enrolling into this course',btohqsg
a lot of my friends LOA y2 y3 or even after 1st sem but they alr know that they are sticking with their course,btohqsg
cos idk if I want to further into research work,btohqsg
cos if I donâ€™t I most likely will just become a teacher lorl,btohqsg
further into research work? You already done your degree?,btohqsg
cos got passion and then money is not bad ahh,btohqsg
don't think there's a lot of research in bachelor degree,btohqsg
research work? it depends on the course you go also  the more common one that extends into doing research work postgraduate is psych or life science that kind,btohqsg
atleast i passed all my mods,btohqsg
we are living in a world  a ex-gang leader can become a buisness owner,btohqsg
its not about how many of these people exist..its why these people exist and how we can learn from them,btohqsg
"""grades are not everything"" is just a populist statement",btohqsg
its hard to pursue being an local artist cause sg doesnâ€™t invest a lot in the arts,btohqsg
unless you wanna travel to america or sk to be an idol / actor,btohqsg
its rlly hard to adapt to new environments cause you hv to learn new language / culture and everything. celebrities suffer a lot since their privacy is being invaded all the time. most fans are obsessed w them,btohqsg
there has to be a conscious effort to become the latter..especially in singapore,btohqsg
"""Money isn't everything""And in latest news:1) Increase in bus fares2) Increase in water prices3) Increase in electricity prices4) Increase in petrol prices5) Increase in COE",btohqsg
Anything isn't important until it is,btohqsg
oh btw@keane223  you know ms karishma ?,btohqsg
Grades are not important.Until someone get something that requires it and you really want it but you don't get.,btohqsg
right even if i hate studying  i hv to burn the midnight oil to secure a good job that is able to give me a good wage,btohqsg
ya my pure chem teacher. goated,btohqsg
she is always online giving us qns to do even at 4am,btohqsg
Add one more word:at least 7 hours rest declared,btohqsg
i honestly feel like its a over complication of life,btohqsg
her aim for my class is 99% distinction cause my class is the strongest in the cohort,btohqsg
yea she will help u at anytime of the day  she even offer consultation session at 7am,btohqsg
