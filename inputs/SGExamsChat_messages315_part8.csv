4 tries for a grade up,btohqsg
HAHAHA ITS OKAY I GOT SMTH LIKE U BEFORE,btohqsg
No harm in retaking still gonna use the best grade,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t want to retake after 3rd round but my teacher persuaded me pretty hard,btohqsg
Why I asked cuz :XX  grad ite 2018 (GPA bad cannot go work learn dip//hnitec)Took Os while working & failed English and Math (for 3 years same results uh) not sure should XX retake one more time.,btohqsg
Hmm no harm retaking but rlly tho,btohqsg
May want to consider private laselle or Nafa,btohqsg
XX resultsEnd d7Math d7Chem b4Bio b3Humanities b3Poa a1Chi b4,btohqsg
@Jiajun04whr would u recommend XX go,btohqsg
I nvr heard this kind of situation b4 so yah,btohqsg
If this xx would have done it 3yrs ago aft the results is out,btohqsg
u dont need to specifically takr drawing arts in nafa/laselle theres other art forms/ things like art management/ art teaching,btohqsg
but nafa is private diploma i heard frm others its tougher to find a uni to go to/job after nafa bc the art field is vv competitive,btohqsg
plus if u retake u can js retake the subjs u need/ go private sch if you can afford that option!,btohqsg
if not u can alw try to appeal to ur sec sch to take u in to retake,btohqsg
But requirements need to pass math,btohqsg
4 subjects under 25 excluding english,btohqsg
d7 shld be ok i think im not too sure,btohqsg
if i recall its c6 so u retake english and combine cert,btohqsg
or u can appeal to nafa,btohqsg
but usually if u dont meet the cut off they wont accept,btohqsg
XX take 3 times alr still d7,btohqsg
Maybe there is an inherent problem with how they study or their environment :(,btohqsg
Isn't that abit l8? For xx,btohqsg
unless they wna retake nitec if thats possible to pull up their gpa,btohqsg
theres not alot of pathways offered ;;; sigh,btohqsg
i get it though im retaking os also,btohqsg
then still cannot go h nitec?,btohqsg
liddat rlly no choice alr sia,btohqsg
I told xx to go work then gain experience then go apply to poly for eae,btohqsg
eae from nitec to poly is 3.5 eh if im not wrong,btohqsg
that one idk much sia paiseh,btohqsg
but if they can go for it bah ^_^!!,btohqsg
hopefully they get in intovthe desired course,btohqsg
But they scared of being judged tho,btohqsg
They're the only ones I can talk to :/,btohqsg
i think everyone just goes at a different route or pace yk,btohqsg
25 year y1 poly w so much complications,btohqsg
You are so much more then a number,btohqsg
they seem willing to work hard so i dont see why not,btohqsg
They asked me if they could go jc,btohqsg
jc is vv risky imo at least,btohqsg
like if u dont do well youre stuck witj an a level cert,btohqsg
at least diploma can find work ykyk,btohqsg
so i think they shld go poly bah,btohqsg
if they got money priv diploma,btohqsg
i have friends also but anyway i think the work option is the best one bah,btohqsg
unless they rlly wna retake os then,btohqsg
they have to consider what theyre not doing to help push up their grades lor i mean maybe some dtufy techniques work and some dont for diff ppl ykyk,btohqsg
I pass the msg to xx when I see xx,btohqsg
