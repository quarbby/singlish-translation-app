Mainly Thundery Afternoon Showers In S’pore For Rest Of March  Temperatures May Reach 34°C🌧🌡Over the next two weeks  there will be short-duration moderate to heavy thundery showers over parts of the island on most afternoons.Sometimes  the rain will last into the evenings.👉https://tsl.to/marchweather@mustsharenews,btohqsg
Shouldn't depend on tips. Most important if company respect partners they won't reduce so low till we feel like hoping and needing tips. Yeah if customer take priority better.,btohqsg
I see 9.10. Nah. COD? Also nah. 😂,btohqsg
Sorry2 i take back my words.. its priority or high demand.. Tips is rare. But end of the day it depends on individual. If its worth the delivery/ distance price than can proceed. If not just take another delivery..,btohqsg

Llm cannot do already now can see $9 before deduct,btohqsg
Llm jialat already lah fee too low after deduction haiya,btohqsg
Somemore raining now no plus 😆,btohqsg
really not worth petrol already do llm,btohqsg
jurong to ang mo kio only $15 before deduction lol,btohqsg
Lucky cny time their fare very high,btohqsg
Their order pay the same as grab short distance,btohqsg
But still a lot take the $9+ order🤔🤔,btohqsg
Llm want to follow grab style give small fare and attract people to use,btohqsg
But grab have incentive trips llm don't have 😭,btohqsg
Thats why I say wait Llm collapse only if they keep giving low fare,btohqsg
If everyone alliance with one heart don't take the order with the fee they gave like duhhhh sure llm management will be worried and start to increase the price back 🤭🤣,btohqsg
They are doing this cause they scared no customers will use if fare too high and they can’t earn,btohqsg
Correct but now they gave the fee is not acceptable after deduction really not worth it but what to do they are the boss 🤭,btohqsg
Ya best thing now is totally boycott Llm,btohqsg
See when no riders also = no customers,btohqsg
Now they start to increase+4 +6 they worried already 😂 like that can take 😆,btohqsg
Why would they want to lower the fee if they had a choice? They work on fixed percentage commission. Lower fee means lower commission. Only lower because no choice  customers going other platform.,btohqsg
Llm high fees are actually pricing themselves out of the market slowly.,btohqsg
so it’s a competition of who can provide the lowest fee,btohqsg
Llm has the highest rider pool on demand because they have the highest fees. Its a balance. Lowering the fees cause riders to go elsewhere but attract more customers.,btohqsg
