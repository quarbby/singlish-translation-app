You have to confirm in your Citi statement that it will be paid via giro.,btohqsg
so essentially i will only know 1 month later? when my statement is out,btohqsg
Which is the best to tag with amaze for cash rebates ?,btohqsg

Imo  dun bother w grabpay ever.... Just use cash/nets/paynow and get over it ....Or go to another shop that accepts the ideal mode of payment u want....,btohqsg
I‚Äôm doing it cos I have miles expiring and not planning to go for a trip,btohqsg
Hahaha i have some balance left whereby cannot transfer back to bank so wanna clear the balance there,btohqsg

for setting up GIRO paid by HSBC EGA for various stuff like Tax (IRAS)  credit cards from a bunch of different banks I have to fill up the forms with signature to the respective bill source?i.e. fill up DBS interbank GIRO form (with HSBC EGA as the debiting account) for DBS credit cards and mail it to DBS?That sounds SO TEDIOUS,btohqsg
Was thinking us whatever card to topup and earn the 1% cashback but just think if there is any better alternative,btohqsg
That's why already mentioned. People who are afraid of hassle should stay far far away from hsbc,btohqsg
Imo  dun count the small pennies  just top up  buy any low value product and get rid of grabpay ..Spend the time n energy on other more productive stuff....,btohqsg
You can also try to book through this linkhttps://www.agoda.com/en-gb/dbsSometimes it's cheaper than booking directly through agoda app or agoda via other third party search engines like TripAdvisor or Google Hotels,btohqsg

Just tried. Cannot add UOB Absolute card to Google pay to pay online  but Paypal can. Any cashback from Paypal?,btohqsg
