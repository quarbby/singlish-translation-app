How this whole moderation system works?,btohqsg
if one yr students generally did badly for a qn,btohqsg
Moderation is based on difficulty of paper. If a particular question has a lot of ppl doing poorly for it. That ques will be marked leniently or the grade required to get a grade for that paper will be adjusted by a mark or two,btohqsg
Then it will hold lesser marks,btohqsg
i mean still v hard for me even with moderation,btohqsg
