When no driver llm will wake up,btohqsg
Once u press settled fees  then no priority le.. Coz the merchant cannot press on Their end.. U leave it  continue ur next job  then u will see x amount has been paid by merchant,btohqsg
Don't know leh... we just ignore and walk off,btohqsg
Honestly the orders are fine. Like wtv la fare abit low. But the worst is we got no CS support,btohqsg
Llm wanna cancel they threaten us w suspension,btohqsg
Lol... I this week only do 2 days.. No mood.. See fees sian le,btohqsg
Customer sometimes play punk we also must tahan,btohqsg
Friday do 12 jobs. 10 cars.. Only 164 gross,btohqsg
Stay home watch money heist.. Lol,btohqsg
So in short the priority fee will auto go in to us ?,btohqsg
Only if u don't press the settle fees when u finish the job,btohqsg
The back room lady says the merchant will have to click the priority payment if they want to book another job.. If not they cant,btohqsg
I tried one where I click settle and another where I did not,btohqsg
The one I click settle  I did not receive any payment on priority.. The other one will inform that they pay.,btohqsg
"U are suppose to call the merchant to inform u have delivered and ask them to click the priority fee payment.. ""suppose""",btohqsg
Thankscharm! Will take note on this,btohqsg
Haha i used to say the same thing abt Grab last time  until everyone seriously suspected i was a Grab Spy. It's not a matter of loyalty... I jus think that while we can be unhappy with some things  there's no need to take it to the level of thinking that the companies take pleasure in torturing drivers. There are many reasons behind every move they make  and in fact a lot of it is to cater to feedback given by drivers.,btohqsg
Eg. Many van drivers may think it is unfair that they are now blocked from bike jobs - but maybe lalamove did that cos many van drivers also complained it was hard to scroll  messy  car and van jobs hard to spot  affect their income  lalamove inconsiderate  times are hard  why make things even harder  etc etc etc etc etc....,btohqsg
"Similarly there are many reasons behind why they designed the new app this way... their ""solutions"" may be flawed  but no company sits in their office thinking of how to make life miserable for others. Only terrorists do that.",btohqsg
So this guy has simply chosen to focus his thoughts on being grateful that he still has a chance to earn income  instead of  eg. constantly believing that the companies and govt have a conspiracy against us  or feeling lousy why lalamove dont know exactly what we want,btohqsg
Neh...terrorist is liddatWith intention to make life difficult for merchantðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
No.... I think a lot by nature ðŸ˜Œ,btohqsg
All these thoughts already have when driving Grab last timeIts also not purposely go think  it looks like a lot in words  but its simply how i see things and my reactions to whats happening ard me,btohqsg
Wow... thats like a lot of work. Same for the tips too?,btohqsg
And a lot of merchant don't know that priority fee now is put as tip,btohqsg
That merchant came out to me and says we are not going to give u tips.. When they put 2 dollars priority fees.,btohqsg
Tried explaining to him that's what lalamove,btohqsg
But he called lalamove to say that I insisted they give me tips,btohqsg
And refuse to leave with the delivery,btohqsg
From what's being conveyed to me from the lalamove back room lady,btohqsg
It seems this app is world wide launch.  The llm peeps inside also dunno anything and they  like us  are facing the wrath of the merchants  while trying to figure what's what in the app,btohqsg
I did notice the new interface for users now indicates if u have made full payment for a jobSo it will reflect in user app also right  that they have to pay the tips?,btohqsg
Meaning the llm peeps in sg are also powerless in the fares deciding,btohqsg
Yup.. That's where the settle fees come in..,btohqsg
If they put priority fees  we cannot settle the fees on our end,btohqsg
They have to settle first before us,btohqsg
If not priority = no priority,btohqsg
I wasted a 8 bucks priority on my first new llm app from pan pacific.. I just click settle fees without knowing,btohqsg
Kk...and i think they cant process that payment until job complete - thats where we press the settle bill button at the end,btohqsg
Sounds silly. Think for me will just focus on without priority or tips that are payable by customer first.,btohqsg
At least wa cow state it upfront,btohqsg
So now it's all called priority fees right,btohqsg
CbAfter the job is completedCustomer don't pay how,btohqsg
Priority fees are still taxable by lalamove right? As in they also draw 16% from it?,btohqsg
That's what I think too.. If its from corporate client  they have to click settle  if not they will be stuck with ordersIf its hdm dwellers... Jialat... They can don't pay  coz they don't need another delivery..,btohqsg
But it's not calculated to our daily earnings.. In the statistic,btohqsg
YeahJus thinking if customer dont pay  but llm still titi deduct comms from our wallet....gg,btohqsg
This new app increase petrol usage by about 20% if u want to hit the amount u make in the old app,btohqsg
More time needed to hit old app,btohqsg
0.32 taxes per 2 dollars tip lor,btohqsg
