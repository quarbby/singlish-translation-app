And holy fk what is this question LMAO,btohqsg
ans is practical but wont fly in exam,btohqsg
Why would a car need to speed up so fast for you to experience length contraction,btohqsg
i tot u say special relativity is ez smh,btohqsg
Bruh I'd assume that the length contraction at 1.5/3.5 is at least 10% of c,btohqsg
Hello for intermediate steps involving currency what dp do u leave it to,btohqsg
And of course nothing can reach this speed,btohqsg
Then can go into another dimension,btohqsg
So thus fitting into the garage,btohqsg
Tell the car owner cut his car in half. Sure can fit,btohqsg
Cher say ans to 2 dp,btohqsg
unfortunately this will net 0 points in exam,btohqsg
Wolfram says a is v≈0.903508 cEDIT: b. is 1.5  but that's an 'exact fit' and also the car must maintain velocity (or rather  the garage needs to maintain this velocity relative to the car  same-ish),btohqsg
Then I guess for intermediate put 4 dp,btohqsg
B because the builder is dumb,btohqsg
qn mentions to use observer to explain,btohqsg
Garage will travel at speed of sound,btohqsg
Then car travel at speed of light,btohqsg
How many children can be saved,btohqsg
Length of garage thus seen by driver is 3.5*10^8 m,btohqsg
ok this is even darker than my source material,btohqsg
i am reporting you to the police for drug usage,btohqsg
What sort of theoretical physics is dis,btohqsg
Another way is to have a two door garage,btohqsg
Open both doors and car can fit without closing the doors,btohqsg
Then no need travel at speed of light. Travel at speed of snail can liao,btohqsg
That’s like saying stop the train to a trolley problem,btohqsg
Stop the trolley boarding the train,btohqsg
Train can go in garage but car cannot,btohqsg
If they tell u interest rate is 5% per annum but compounded half yearly,btohqsg
a small price to pay for salvation,btohqsg
Must u divide by the time period oso,btohqsg
Like is r still 5 or 2.5,btohqsg
Derp I think I was wrong in the 'not fitting' part,btohqsg
The owner is a direct observer as well,btohqsg
so the frame of reference is the car.  which would be traveling at 0.9c and the garage would be 1.5m which would be deltaL0,btohqsg
Ya the garage should be exactly 1.5m (as measured by the moving car),btohqsg
But considering that the car still has momentum,btohqsg
Divide r by 2 and multiply n by 2,btohqsg
Honestly there's a lot of weird part about it,btohqsg
And part b is just a 'beginning',btohqsg
the components in question are simply entities to help visualisation,btohqsg
There is fine line between love and hate,btohqsg
Hey hey no hate speech in this chat,btohqsg
Ok  i (antonym of love) kor,btohqsg
If you're saying this  it implies that you used to love him,btohqsg
I make alt with his original number,btohqsg
I have yet to exercise my admin powers,btohqsg
He meant my kor will ban me himself...,btohqsg
"U forgot the """" around powers",btohqsg
