I wrote in that time due to this as i have a better job offer  the hdb representative that contact me told me hdb loan goes by length of employment. If u does not want to be affected  u need to make sure there is no lapse in ur pay. Meaning you have to start work straightaway for ur next job without taking any break before ur next employment starts,btohqsg
For bank loan it doesnt matter as they go by salary   the higher the salary the more u can loan for bank loan,btohqsg
den just make sure there is no downtime on ur salary. So that u can produce 3 mths pay slip,btohqsg
It doesnt matter that is from different company so long is full 3mths,btohqsg
