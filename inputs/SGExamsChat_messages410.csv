Will be a bit sad if he turns to internet strangers to help him name his kid,btohqsg
You wish that you had that kind of power over me to anger me  but you never will  because I refuse to give anyone power over me  especially not you. And you‚Äôre not even worth the calories that I burn if I let myself get upset with you.,btohqsg

Ouch but seriously you think that hurt,btohqsg
You shall never be able the hurt mentally and physically the great Octavius Gluteaus Maximum Joel the third blood heir to the throne of england,btohqsg
who wants to buy me a car,btohqsg
No  I hate that I have this compulsive addiction to be unable to resist roasting the living daylights out of him  but I only barely minimally tolerate his existence in mild neutrality  because I have to  and because I‚Äôm better than stooping to his level.,btohqsg
You mind my 2.99 hot wheels,btohqsg
considering that cop is 90k for a small car,btohqsg
if a 153 human can fit idm,btohqsg
It wasn‚Äôt aimed to wound. Can‚Äôt you learn to stop being so stubborn headed and listen to good advice?,btohqsg

I got a 12/50 for my 30% midterm but p sure can get 90/100 at least for my 50% final,btohqsg
nope I am waiting for gwyn to type finish,btohqsg
Then here‚Äôs a thought for you to ponder over  why are you still spending time talking to us here when you could be making better use of your time studying productively to give yourself an actual fighting chance to make it for chemistry instead of weakly giving up and just moping around sadly giving us excuses for why you think you can‚Äôt? You are what you choose to make of your outcome. Figure out what you can tolerate living with  and whether or not you‚Äôd want to live in regret of your choices made that you can‚Äôt change. Because no one else can. Why didn‚Äôt you think or figure that out sooner? Geez  I don‚Äôt know  maybe spend more time on the internet searching for the irrelevant answers that wouldn‚Äôt matter and wasting your precious limited time to study doing so? Either way  no amount of advice any one here could give you would save you if you don‚Äôt help yourself out here. Walk the talk  Joel. Don‚Äôt give yourself weak excuses and hide behind cowardice saying that you can‚Äôt make it  if you don‚Äôt even give yourself a fair chance to. Thank you.,btohqsg
But yes i will try my best,btohqsg
Did you think the pigheaded person would listen to our advice now? He hasn‚Äôt before. So  what‚Äôs different about this time?,btohqsg
This chat has so many different personalities,btohqsg
Bro if you click the heart,btohqsg
Feel like two of us just always observers to the shit that goes on,btohqsg
You got your hand right there,btohqsg
@chemcerSomeone please go mute Joel until the end of As so that he doesn‚Äôt procrastinate studying and being distracted in this group chat  because I actually am feeling levels of rage that I never knew that I could experience right now.,btohqsg
He‚Äôs too busy with his own As to care about Joel‚Äôs lmao,btohqsg
What does that even mean like is it supposed to replace wuck or what,btohqsg
Fair. Can‚Äôt save someone who‚Äôs dead set on drowning himself  anyways.,btohqsg
Why would he help someone that may pull down the curve,btohqsg
That would be terrifying  but would they really put in that much effort to do so,btohqsg
I js went to mop and,btohqsg
I mean is there really much else to say,btohqsg
I was giving him good advice and nagging,btohqsg
js me or gwyn picks up a fight with everyone,btohqsg
first thing I texted gwyn was 'I found a prom dress',btohqsg
EH PLS LA THE NUMBER OF TIMES I BEEN CALLED 'u meme' 'u joke',btohqsg
Not that its of any use to try and nag at him. He won‚Äôt listen.,btohqsg
I support bill as a whole,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think they pick a fight with me,btohqsg
I‚Äôm an old man doing old man things,btohqsg
gwyn to joel but more aggressive,btohqsg
How could you do this to me traitor,btohqsg
My heart no more bedok bedok,btohqsg
And I support them usually because they aren‚Äôt being stupidly inane with their often not reckless actions.,btohqsg
It is training for General Paper,btohqsg
And I was like are you sure you‚Äôre texting the correct person,btohqsg
You won‚Äôt know if you get 25 tho,btohqsg
Idea  I should use Mr Physics as my nickname,btohqsg
or maybe for a new series of books hmm,btohqsg
mr physics and mr physics 2.0,btohqsg
