Anyone knows how long it will take to open POEMS account?,btohqsg
So this is naked short sell volume? Since sgx dont capture cfd shorts,btohqsg
Correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
Hi I am planning to open POEMS account  but there are 2 accounts  one is cash plus and the other cash management account  what’s the difference between them?,btohqsg
Cash plus is use for trading mainly with $10 comms  but poems hold ur shares instead  whereas cash mgmt account charge standard brokerage fees around $28  but CDP holds the shares .,btohqsg
I see  any idea which is the more popular one?,btohqsg
You can create both haha  i use them interchangeably. i mainly use cash management to buy reits n banks to keep for dividends  and top up like some $ into the cash plus account for trading because the coms only $10.,btohqsg
Thank you!! Last qn  how long do you wait before account is fully open?,btohqsg
If you apply online  maybe 1 week will be activated already  then if u create both cash plus + mgmt  you will receive 2 log in ID. No worries  can pm me if u got more ques,btohqsg
