Marco Polo Marine to build  own and operate new CSOV to support offshore windfarm demandsConstruction of CSOV is expected to be completed tentatively by 1Q2024The Group is optimistic about the demand for its new CSOV service  having already received keen interest from leading offshore windfarm turbine makers and offshore windfarm developersStrong Industry outlookAccording to Clarksons‚Äô offshore wind support vessel report for 2Q2022  charterers for offshore wind support vessels have started to secure ships earlier and for longer due to rising concerns of a shortage of suitable ships to meet the growth of the offshore windfarm market.In particular  CSOVs have seen higher utilisation and day rates across all regions due to higher demand from both renewables and the oil and gas sector as well as a rise in prices for newbuilt vessels.Clarksons has observed an increase in day rates for CSOV notably in the shorter-term contracts but is also starting to see a potential increase in longer term rates.Link to PR:https://links.sgx.com/FileOpen/MPM%20-%20Build%20Own%20Operate%20CSOV.ashx?App=Announcement&FileID=731968,btohqsg
"Key point of this report:Buyers all over Asia  and some from Europe  flew in to the conference to hunt for any coal supply they can secure ahead of winter  as global supply shortages and growing energy security concerns drive an unprecedented rebound in coal demand.""Coal never went anywhere. We got another 20 years with coal  like it or not "" Ben Lawson  an executive with Sanaman Coal  said on the sideline of Coaltrans when asked if coal is back.Summary of this news:""For the short term  everybody seems to agree that based on recent developments  there is a lot of optimism that coal will remain a mainstay in power source. Not only in Asia  but even Europeans are buying "" said Hendra Sinadia  executive director  Indonesia Coal Miners Association on the sidelines of the conference.",btohqsg
