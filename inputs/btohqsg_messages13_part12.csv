Applied 14 times. 4 times MP letter  3 letters under LHL grc. Ended with resale. So yup you do the chances calculation yourself,btohqsg
Guess the one my friend managed to get a few years back after MP letter was likely chance then,btohqsg
Really just pray hard that the ballot system will be good to you. I myself applied for priority scheme but I don't give myself too much hope.,btohqsg
U can try but dont pin hopes,btohqsg
Resale is extremely expensive now  but if really need a house now  need to sacrifice abit. In fact  the benefits for resale e.g staying near parents  kids  etc  may put the price point on par with BTO.,btohqsg
Then did u still vote for him hahah sigh,btohqsg
U sure i vote for him? You saw my votes?,btohqsg
lol. Is there a all powerful MP? I would like to move to their estate.,btohqsg
Haha I only ask if u did  glad you didn't,btohqsg
Housing is a big issue  but somehow no one pushes for much change here,btohqsg
Buy resale also dangerous  if kena sers dunno how,btohqsg
My gf stay under lhl grc. Never see him or the grassroots leaders. The surrounding blocks area very dirty  lots of rats n cockroaches at night,btohqsg
Good ma Kenna sers. Get a brand new 99yrs Lease flat üòÅüëç,btohqsg
When will the bto results be out ah,btohqsg
Actually. IMHO when I looked closely for those needed to top up. They have their loan ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù. Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a good thing for them or not.,btohqsg

Hi  do anyone have any idea if after submission of BTO application  can I still utilise the Married Child Priority scheme (MCPS) in my application? Appreciate if anyone could answer thisüôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
As we misunderstood the scheme  thinking it only apply to resale flat,btohqsg
Only to find out the second point was referring to bto,btohqsg
once application is submitted and closed  i dont think you are able to add this in,btohqsg
Ya I don‚Äôt think you can amend your application.You can only place another $10 for a new application to supersede the old if it is still within the application periodJust have to take note next time  anyways the MCPS not a sure win  gives you an additional chance on a selected % of the estate depending on the maturity. For my side  it was 20%,btohqsg
Just pray that you heng and still get a queue #,btohqsg
The only loss is the additional ballot chance,btohqsg
If it makes you feel better  a lot of ppl still don't get a queue number even with mcps anyway so might as well be no diff,btohqsg
Thanks for all your help to clear my doubts üò¨,btohqsg
Hi all. How does hdb bto balloting system works? Do they separate first timer and second timer base on their % allocated?,btohqsg
are bto results coming out soon?,btohqsg
1st timer just get 2 ballot while 2nd timer only have 1. Basically just 1 extra ticket to get selected.,btohqsg
Hi any updates for bto feb 2022 flat selction date?,btohqsg
btw  for the Deferred Income Assessment scheme  if both of us just completed full time studies within 12 months  but one of us has been working part time for more than 12 months  are we still eligible?,btohqsg
During my HDB appointment  we were told that as long as you‚Äôre studying full-time  your PT/FT work during that course of time you were studying still won‚Äôt count.In my case  our DIA will be pushed to 3 months prior to key collection where they‚Äôll re-assess and allocate the grant amount based on the salary you‚Äôre getting then.,btohqsg
ahhh I see...thank you v much! :D,btohqsg
Because I will be going NS  then my partner working PT but just completed full tiem studies in May,btohqsg
From what was explained during our appointment  I think they‚Äôll only start counting the period of employment from May/June onwards. You could write in to HDB/give them a call to seek advice on this too just to confirm again :),btohqsg
yeah good idea  you have explained it so well to me  thank you very much  really appreciate it! :D,btohqsg
No worries. All the best with your BTO journey! ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
