I think don’t bah… maybe better to go with a car that will likely give you less maintenance burden? Unless you have owned several cars before and are mentally prepared to go through some efforts to clean up the car? Not saying it’s a bad car at all but performance cars just need a bit more preventive maintenance and care etc…,btohqsg
Vios is Yaris cross sedan version,btohqsg
Ya  performance car is a different beast on its own. I think for first time buyer should consider getting 'normal' car first before going for it,btohqsg
U want u dont get such a high maintenance car. Get a semi perf car,btohqsg
I will not touch it w a 5 foot pole,btohqsg
Dexteron one hand  u’re only young and foolish once  at least u can say U had it once  on the other hand  if you’re really pragmatic  thn the decision is pretty straightforward.Financial decisions not withstanding,btohqsg
It’s like owning a yacht. Buying one isn’t that expensive  but the parking fees and maintenance will really get that mentally and financially unprepared.,btohqsg
Atmost bankrupt start from 0 again,btohqsg
These kind of cars like prostitutes,btohqsg

No win one in Singapore. End of that journey  one can be penniless while other more financially astute friends would have spent that time accumulating a nice bank and investment account. Life choices.,btohqsg
Only 3 outcome.1) sell at a loss2) scrap n get back whatever's left at a loss3) drive till ur pocket big hole,btohqsg
Plus this M5  i think u want loan also very difficult,btohqsg
Insurance wise sure give u figure frm the moon,btohqsg
Cars like this.. someone told me mainly attract other hot blooded .. males. 😁 So really depends on one’s reason for buying these cars.,btohqsg

Must think from young person perspective  if not now  then when?,btohqsg
Next time even got money  got other commitment already,btohqsg
No family no kid  can risk to buy this M5,btohqsg
Imagine car spoil need 5k. Kid go hospital need 5k. Choose 1,btohqsg
Singapore isn’t a place where one wakes up one day and decides “I think it is time to save up to buy a house” and it happens the next day one.,btohqsg
Find something else less financially damaging to YOLO bah,btohqsg
If one has to full or majority loan to buy a performance car  the answer is pretty clear whether or not to buy.,btohqsg
