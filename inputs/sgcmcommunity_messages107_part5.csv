In terms of sound quality that is.,btohqsg
You know when a car is just zeng exos vs pure intake large engine well made exos,btohqsg
Yes! Smaller is better of course!!,btohqsg
Drag coefficient: I love how fast EV owners shed well designed low drag coefficient stock rims for.. sporrims!!!!,btohqsg
The lodeh needs more color though hehe  like carrots and green beans,btohqsg
Yeah  not enough color on my plate,btohqsg
Reasonable considering chicken rice is like $7,btohqsg

Who goes MBS eat Nasi Padang!,btohqsg

It’s ppl like u that push up the food prices,btohqsg
U better cook same way .. sell at $11.80,btohqsg
Which car brands are going fully-electric? Here's everything we know as of January 2023 🤗Come 2030  will every carmaker still offer ICE models? We take stock of every brand relevant to us  and try to unravel what car buying will look like here soon.➡️ Read itHERE!,btohqsg
EV is still impractical to own. Charging stations are so few. Tax rebate is insignificant compared with current exorbitant prices. 2030 target is a big question. I would question why our Ministers aren’t taking the lead? Why not LTA change their vehicles to EV first? They should take the lead.,btohqsg
I want to mod my EV with illegal exhaust,btohqsg
please make them cheaper so i can make this dream come true,btohqsg
Actually Ah.. Maxhaust is “illegal” only if it goes above certain limit.,btohqsg
pfff maxhaust is softer than those yp pmd,btohqsg
Lta sent me email say illegal,btohqsg
Sure they sent you or you go see online?,btohqsg
Maxhaust just need to turn off during inspection,btohqsg
And cannot exceed a certain level of decibels,btohqsg
But anyway it doesn't sound good at lower speeds,btohqsg
Same tots  maybe another 3-4 years see how. I rather buy back ICE if I want better hp,btohqsg
petrol saving go back to battery replacement . bk to sq 1,btohqsg
EV also. EV batt lagi more exp,btohqsg
So fast selling? Less than 6mth😁👍,btohqsg
See in UK over Christmas… queue 3h just to charge,btohqsg
How you guys know this one?,btohqsg
But i feel too exp leh. 2.8k just for sound with no perf boost.,btohqsg
Holy mama. If wanna do smth so exp  i change whole exhaust better,btohqsg
Got a 5% perf boost also song,btohqsg
Plus the performance increase dependent on whether you get legal or not,btohqsg
The ones that actually give you decent perf increase are illegal,btohqsg
Its only illegal cus of the noise/emissions and stuff which I agree upon. Civic mindedness is lacking in some car owners today,btohqsg
Can’t tell if you mean civic or civil but your phone thinks you’re always about cars.,btohqsg
Baller don’t eat food court lol,btohqsg
Steady Ah  next Monday I want one piece,btohqsg
Can eat in baller food court still baller 🤓,btohqsg
Agree with the tax structure. Quite baseless. And brilliant idea for ministers or the entire Govt to be leading the pack with full ev fleet.But if I remember correctly there are more chargers than electric vehicles now. And by average I think most people pump once a week and an ev range is about 400 so roughly charge one a week also. I don’t think it’s hard to charge.,btohqsg
It’s a chicken and egg problem. If not enough chargers  people don’t buy ev. If not enough people buy ev  Govt don’t build chargers,btohqsg
EV cannot be used like ICE vehicle,btohqsg
Must be used with a top up when you can model,btohqsg
If everyone starts rushing to charge once a week,btohqsg
The charger network will definitely not be able to support,btohqsg
Go eat nasi padang  top up in the carpark while you can,btohqsg
But if complete EV adoption happens,btohqsg
Would need parking lots to be full of chargers,btohqsg
Imagine the effect of this on the grid,btohqsg
That will be worst case scenario for people who don’t have charger at home. Wherever u go  got charger just plug in. No range anxiety at all plus got dedicated lots  no need to looks for lots,btohqsg
