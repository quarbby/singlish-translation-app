rotors buy high temp one  same as brake pads,btohqsg
but it also depends on car to car,btohqsg
your GTR you think stock brakes will overheat meh,btohqsg
they designed the car to be go on track stock,btohqsg
for a light car like gk  not big issue,btohqsg
but the 1.3L i rmb they use smaller rotors and rear drums,btohqsg
so if wanna track will likely need upgrades,btohqsg
heavy car like mine  idk. need to see how. just give yourself more safety margin on the braking,btohqsg
same as swift vs swift sport.,btohqsg
At the end of the day is  go track  play first  then see what you lack then upgrade,btohqsg

U so hurry want to fix meh,btohqsg
Isn't this car in our group also?,btohqsg
Just a small misunderstanding only ba. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻,btohqsg
But tbh  not a lot of ppl know road hogging is illegal. Soooooo. Just over take and go beh. 😂,btohqsg
Usually tp don't fully enforce on road hogging as people keep it within speed limit. Thats why people will have that mentality thinking I'm at the max speed limit on lane one and you still want poke me  then people get angst about it.,btohqsg
That's one way how road rage happen also,btohqsg
You only road hog when a big ass lorry driving on lane 1 or 2 to just slow them down and let them return to their respective lane to prevent unwanted accidents,btohqsg
If can  even if you are within the speed limit and on lane 1  then the behind vehicle is creeping up and started poking you  change lane asap as a soon as your left lane is clear.,btohqsg
This is why tp always says if you are on speed limit or within or not  try to stay at lane 2 or left as possible to prevent unwanted road rage and accidents.,btohqsg
Haha if road hog lane 1  drive at speed limit... Someone faster comes from behind confirm Kenna say tailgate one mah.One want to drive at speed limit  don't wan to change lane. The other wants to go faster  but don't wish to overtake by left.,btohqsg
Actually also see how near you stay behind,btohqsg
Let me try to fully rephrase in road rules chapter section form,btohqsg
Expressway/Road trafficRule 5(1) Drive at slow speed and failing to keep as close to the left and side of the road as possible  First offence $1000 or 3 months jail term.Rule 5(2) Drive in such manner as to obstruct vehicles moving at higher speed  First offence $1000 or 3 months jail term.,btohqsg
Lesser known laws are more of need to enforce to prevent unwanted road rage ma,btohqsg
If stay far = thinks it's okCome closer but not too near = I should move asideVery near = wtf this feller doingVery near + high beam = later upload video,btohqsg
North south highway people behind you love to high beam.,btohqsg
That's why I enjoy driving in msia,btohqsg
Here all Abt thinking they got right of way and all that bull shit,btohqsg
Same like you want to cross the road  here must really look out,btohqsg
If you go to Vietnam  you just walk and everyone goes around you,btohqsg
I really wanna go msia sia. Mainly to drive there on the road.,btohqsg
There I feel like I change gear at higher rpm,btohqsg
I don't know is it just me but I feel like the wheels roll better in sg. Like less drag,btohqsg
Hehe joining TP soon uh bro,btohqsg
Oh ya you join much later ah.,btohqsg
I did announce my job when it was around 100+members 😂😂,btohqsg
Ya. So you really ish TP?!,btohqsg
How you can forget this kind of appointment,btohqsg
Was busy with other thing and it slipped thru my mind,btohqsg
Iseeisee. Good evening sir. Thank you for your driving tips.,btohqsg
Aiya.. same la I just shut down my laptop a while ago. Work work.,btohqsg
No luh. Nth compared to TP... Everyday so many accident cases..,btohqsg
Recently really alot of accidents on roads,btohqsg
Round the clock keep the road safe.,btohqsg
Cyclist are a major cause of the accidents,btohqsg
Ya simi pattern ma wu. Wide swing U turn also have. Truck overturn also have.,btohqsg
I hope all cyclist fall and break some bones... At least that way better then kena rub over,btohqsg
Which cyclist?? The one group with 10plus on limchukang type or the one at tuas end work type?,btohqsg
Those road bikes and grab food,btohqsg
Those old uncle on bikes also cb one anyhow,btohqsg
Road bikes I can say they are too self entitled  because they are small they have the biggest power on the road which is true  but they just don't care.,btohqsg
Basically I hate bikes on roads,btohqsg
Grab food thay one no need explains,btohqsg
I stopped ordering grabfood n Foodpanda cuz of this.,btohqsg
Tuas just ended work type that one I like  like msia drivers very understanding,btohqsg
Grab riders quite fucked up but they provide a service to us,btohqsg
Everytime I see them run red light  I just don't feel like ordering.,btohqsg
My wife is one of them,btohqsg
Road bikes just take up space,btohqsg
Did she join in to stick the sticker on the lamp post,btohqsg
No  she cycle from Joo koon MRT to office to work  and end work cycle back to Joo Koon mrt,btohqsg
Why you don't give taxi money,btohqsg
Overtake on the left.. ltr the road hogger salty or red eyes. Posting and say youre speeding and dangerous driving or reckless driving whichever they happy to say.,btohqsg
She don't want me to waste money,btohqsg
That area mornings can be dangerous... A lot of heavy vehicle,btohqsg
Haha later 2  3  4  5 cars overtake by left. Then say they racing. Excellent story 👍,btohqsg
But then end up is road hogger hogging like the father build the road..,btohqsg
Well  before 7am no heavy vehicles enter that road. From time to time I send her to work and witness no heavy vehicles besides working individuals with bicycles,btohqsg
Lol these kind need to send them to msia nshw. I think probably still stubborn af.,btohqsg
Thats what i told my gf everytime i road rage inside when i see a dog hogger,btohqsg
So ya  that road is pretty safe. But I did tell her if can cycle on pavement as you dunno when the car driver suddenly go haywire and start to maxtune your way,btohqsg
"Must stick a led sign at the back of our car that says ""road hogger"" so you over take then on the light... Then drive off",btohqsg
They shld go msia try road hog,btohqsg
Who knows those ppl there not happy take pickup truck and bang.. viola,btohqsg
Yes I personally cycle on pavement. If I actually do cycle,btohqsg
One less hogger and... ill not,btohqsg
Then again... i wish sometimes i apply for TP.,btohqsg
They do it leh bro. Ever encounter on nshw before. All the SG car shake head.,btohqsg
They heng havent kena those siao siao msian before.. 😂,btohqsg
