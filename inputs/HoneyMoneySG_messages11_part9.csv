Have not tried so I cant advise but i would think that they would check your credit rating etc and they may not approve depending on how many cards you have applied in a short span of time as it may seem you are borrowing large sums of money,btohqsg
Anything less than 1000 SGD  can use citi rewards 4mpd with amaze,btohqsg

Hi guys  I‚Äôm planning on getting a card for general spending but also buying honeymoon air tix soon and big ticket items next year. Generally a low spender 500-600/mth and don‚Äôt think it will go up significantly. Currently only have SCB Smart card. Interested in idea of miles/travelling yearly(w or wo using miles) but aside from air tickets/hotel spending does my expenditure make me more suited to cashback?Planning to buy tickets via skyscanner for 1) a bangkok trip ASAP and 2) honeymoon tickets earliest end of the month/next two months est 1.8k. I was thinking of applying for HSBC revo for a go-to card cuz of the versatility/sign up bonus and charge bangkok tix to it but noted from others that hsbc is slow with their approval. What are my options?Should I go for citi premiermiles first just to charge the bangkok trip and also use it for honeymoon following month or just cashback üòÖ,btohqsg

Citi cashback 8% or maybank fnf*With amaze,btohqsg
Citibank cashback. I tried following the steps but the instructions seem outdated. I contacted the staff  they should reply me tmr.,btohqsg
Criteria to hit the 1.4% for the first $50k is to have 4/5 transactions spent using the card itself per month basis,btohqsg
Just the cashback card  not cashback+,btohqsg
As in anythingNot related to fairprice I bet,btohqsg
My Citi cashback dun need to sms,btohqsg
Citi Rewards card  better to take the gifts (singsaver - dyson hairdyer  everdesk or sony headphones; moneysmart - ipad  capitavouchers  nintendo switch) or the $350 cash?,btohqsg
You calculate the amount yrself. See whether selling at carousell justify the effort.,btohqsg
oof i see  okay thanks üëç,btohqsg
After sending back the redemption form to select your choice of reward upon cc signup.Is there anything we need to do upon hitting required spending  or just wait for reward to be sent over?,btohqsg
Their Sony headphones r dope  but if none of those items appeal to you  just take cash.,btohqsg
Need wait a few months de,btohqsg
Ok  so long as no need to do anything else.Thanks.,btohqsg
