first mass shooting killing more than 10 in 4 years,btohqsg
har i not talking abt ur post,btohqsg
and the general sentiment over it,btohqsg
without exams also they asking about exam questions,btohqsg
before these national exams i alr read of people being burned out or burning out and they are asking for tips,btohqsg
I want d7 for math ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Why is the Reddit so toxic today,btohqsg
they told me my PSLE was the hardest in 10 years..,btohqsg
They even did a CNA episode exactly about PSLE on that very year,btohqsg
i believed it till sec 3..cause if not why would CNA make a whole episode just for it,btohqsg
Idk my frens who retook English said it was easy,btohqsg
I thought first year of the syllabus is always the easiest,btohqsg
Her parents were even self conscious that they were pushing their own kids hard,btohqsg
ngl making an entire post about this is only proving that person's point,btohqsg
just getting baited by people that really don't care about the rant,btohqsg
"I used to comment on instagram and post on reddit  with these type of post but i realise the fact i keep needing to reiterate the fact im not ""blaming others"" or ""others are not wrong""basically told me that..I actually did not fully 100% support what im typing...In that case  i just decided to not post or comment because..If im not 100% behind what im about to post  then what's the point",btohqsg
the person they're trying to direct it to is probs laughing about it,btohqsg
you can tell this post was posted without thought.It is one of those post you just post because you felt like you need to say something just to feel better and not feel oppressed,btohqsg
yea they're just ranting to get it out,btohqsg
like getting the last word in,btohqsg
Whoever that wrote this must've really been pissed off. And like i mean whoever this person was like as if blaming the surrounding liddat,btohqsg
I have never seen a batch of students complain abt a paper this hard before regardless of how difficult the paper is,btohqsg
"And the complaints are ""oh it's different from previous years"" papers like ya no shit what's the point of testing the same things over and over again",btohqsg
Let me js say 07 r the most selfish n think theyâ€™re entitled people,btohqsg
idk y but all of them liddat,btohqsg
Why u making sound like a child predator,btohqsg
Im literally only one year older,btohqsg
There a undeniable shift from 2004 to 2005 kids,btohqsg
2005 2006 2007 onwards are negligible,btohqsg
I don't rmb it being that hard,btohqsg
Honestly I thought we all just trolling after the paper,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not about them being chronically online  itâ€™s about how they view the world.I can say a lot of them like to try the system after 2004  like they will test and see how far they can go in circumstances and push boundaries,btohqsg
Got a seminar to prep for later,btohqsg
this convo has happened before and you literally agreed. There is a shift...whether its them constantly pushing boundaries or not.I could be wrong  but something about them are diff compared to the 04s and older.Unless you are telling me you are blindly agreeing,btohqsg
Brought out the sources and citations ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
is tht comment section meant to be positive or negative lol. tf is the person trying to say,btohqsg
its pent up annoyance to help them reinforce the fact that SEAB was partially responsible for their uncertainty of not doing well,btohqsg
too many post of that lately. tbh shld jst make a mega thread let everyone rant there.,btohqsg
alot of other non related o level post r not being shown,btohqsg
im talking bout the retarded reddit sub,btohqsg
i think that pple who complained,btohqsg
are all those that last minute study,btohqsg
never have i seen consistent classmates complaining,btohqsg
always those never study or last minute study,btohqsg
then they self proclaimed 'i studied',btohqsg
more ppl for ite intake then,btohqsg
no shot u find the paper hard,btohqsg
then they get a2 they cry,btohqsg
actually there is a most concrete statement which is the 2010s are just built differentBeing borin into a world where they have screen the momment they are born...its somehow or rather gets them to mature faster and face instances that kids before them would otherwise feel or experience only 6-8 years later,btohqsg
its negligible what year od kids are actually that transitional year from going through their early years without the internet,btohqsg
