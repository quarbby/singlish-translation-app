i agree on HK Pump and dump warning but in this case mas seems to be insuinalting sgx movementsmas should use a different graph ma like capitalland for examplemas in this warning also no mention hk or other countries in particular,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why best to decide on your own trade EP  TP  SL  protect your own money.,btohqsg
agree this is always base case,btohqsg
the real scam or rather the warning should go something like a real example of HK scamsstarts with helloasks you want make money then insert a counter in hkd that shows price up fast and collapse fast,btohqsg
then i agree mas is warning on hk scamsin this case i feel mas seems to be a bit unfair in representations,btohqsg
Just submitted on the 8 Dec 2020 yesterday,btohqsg
Market tough  perhaps those lose and write in to SGX and complain etc.So SGX just issue warning.Ultimately  just want to issue a disclaimer . please do not take anything written as a sure thing. Everyone have opinions and want to be right but market is hard to predict. Anything can happen.,btohqsg
Can anyone advise on the US SEC submission time frame for approval for Alset inc?,btohqsg
Everyone should take this as discussion and to learn from the better traders. Cannot follow blindly . Because good traders when they see market forces reacting against . They will react accordingly.That‚Äôs why new traders need to trade counters that are safer. Spend time to read up on the company or through channels which provide info etc.Hard earned money y‚Äôall,btohqsg
Next year star will shift my attention to work. Stop letting Share play me. üòîüòí,btohqsg
agreethis kind of warning since start we already did say toojust taking issues with how MAS is saying this (means fry up nanofilm dbs reits can but fry up MT JT cannot?) what happen to opportunity spotting free market balancingif MAS SGX wants to regulate or do anything. tons of things waiting (midas  china fishery  yamada green  sino grandness  eratat  hongxing or even low balled offers bordering abuse of loopholes in MAS SGX like delisting of Perennial reat estate china trust  otto marine  vard  courts  tiger airways) etc etc this list sibei longapologise for type so long but to me this is MAS saying Âè™ÈúÄÂéøÂÆòÁ∫µÁÅ´ ‰∏çÈúÄÂπ≥Ê∞ëÁÇπÁÅØ,btohqsg
use warrent buffet value investing to trade...volatility trading not my cup of tea,btohqsg
already warned so long agovacinne overhypedand this is the world's fastest most unconfident vacinnation programme that most probably exacerbate deaths(merck ceo say  WHO say  neutral scientist says  doctors says)vaccine not means cure or treatmentso hard to understand ahü§£,btohqsg
i want go malaysia buy ÂåÖ so anticipating but always disappointed,btohqsg
alternatively it also means only allow market makers playsmall retailers only can lose moneyif sti sgx is efficientMT is already $3 JT 25centsbut fact is that sti sgx is inefficientbefore MAS SGX talk cock and bull like this please go catch more market manipulators,btohqsg

Japfa yesterday 1.2m sharebuyback. Today fly. üëç,btohqsg
Medical play should be back. I feel Vaccine is not ready. Too early  too soon and rushed as much as i want it to work to normalise and save lives. thats why Singapore do not rush to get it. Sg govt wait and see the vaccine effect before letting citizens take üëç,btohqsg

Some thread said here also spread pump n dump  naming vivid3,btohqsg
hide here hide there give excuses then end of day change answers also,btohqsg
If HSO also up above 1  then they will accused again,btohqsg
BBs pump up 50% no problem. Retailer pump 10% warning lol. Isoteam they say retailers fake volume by selling back and forth. Dont BBs do that all the time.,btohqsg
there is alot of PND here recommend by the BB......but hor we decide to believe in them.....No one to blame.......BLAME only ourselve,btohqsg
what's there to complain to MAS or SGX......No people force us to believe in them,btohqsg
GIC's stake in DoorDash bumped to US$5b after first-day pop in public market  Garage - THE BUSINESS TIMEShttps://www.businesstimes.com.sg/garage/gics-stake-in-doordash-bumped-to-us5b-after-first-day-pop-in-public-market,btohqsg
is the Greed that kill us,btohqsg
Don't say gic or temasek always lose money,btohqsg
but all this is still not profitable....still so many ppl buy,btohqsg
I'm waiting for my PLTR share coming to me in late March,btohqsg
Sgx has no growth stocks  if no pump and dump what else can BBs do lol.,btohqsg
DT pushed vaccine for his election and he got 'infected' and now so called 'immune'. Very smart  DT does need to be vaccinated.,btohqsg
Have growth stock  just that these stocks are forever traded at low valuations and no one interested,btohqsg
Vividthree is my call though.I see potential in the counter. Otherwise why insider Dr Ho buy $0.070 and a lot of hands changed $0.070 to $0.080 earlier.Catalyst and business collaborations.,btohqsg
Then finally the big owners da bolek tahan and take it private,btohqsg
Ya  think I saw in SJ saying here spread pump n dump,btohqsg
VV3 I second dax. Got good fundamentals. News. Collabs. JV.,btohqsg
My initial post Oct 28 on VV3 when I collected $0.050 and mentioned Vividthree ‚Äòfree money‚Äô theory. Price tanked further and collected more too. If followed with me. All win,btohqsg
Oil up. Tomorrow smm and rex can cheong,btohqsg
I deleted my comment on Vividthree being a pump and dump and pushing the blame 100% to the Syndicate discussion group on Telegram  to be fair  as the call was made way earlier to allow traders to position themselves for the big spike in the morning. However  pls be wary of the Syndicate Stock Group (Penny Stock Discussion). They generaily target easily manipulated low float counters. Pls do change your privacy setting as they are adding our members (despite them complaining about and claiming falsely that we are adding THEIR members).,btohqsg
Why they never catch those tiong hongkie pump and dump?,btohqsg
