But turbo cars just do tuning,btohqsg
Jdm is like ur andriod phone.Conti is like iphones.,btohqsg
but if u factor in the weight of the car oso like 300+hp in jdms,btohqsg
For NA.....u need alot of lui to even up 30bhp on dyno,btohqsg

Is whether the driver wan or not nia,btohqsg
Driver must be more garang than the car..or else very hard😂,btohqsg
Reminds me of one line I learn from ns driving sch,btohqsg
Is you control the vehicle  not the vehicle control you,btohqsg
But some vehicle at 90 you feel like that's the most you want to go  but on another one maybe at 140 then you have the same feel as the one running at 90,btohqsg
N how well u know n trust ur car,btohqsg

waaa i kena saman at jb 😭😭,btohqsg
they say my exhaust is illegal at jb..but i got cert for it,btohqsg
N55 has higher potential then n54 tho and more reliable,btohqsg
Some parts like con rod etc is forged the rest identically similar,btohqsg
But ofcos diff from 535 cause it’s heavy,btohqsg
the m2 engine got like 50+ horses more frm factory🥲,btohqsg
Cause it’s m tuned urs is not that’s why there’s the  diff,btohqsg
Huh? Loll... They gave u saman for that?,btohqsg
Wah I like Kaling Loh’s FDR2 sia. I just saw her IG post and she did a drift!,btohqsg
even if both on bm3 stage 2  the m2 makes more power bc of the reinforced pistons etc,btohqsg
U can forged n55 but m2 is faster cause it’s dct not zf that’s the big diff,btohqsg
535 is pneumatic wastegate  m2 is electronic,btohqsg
the ewg version makes 20-30 hp more than the pwg,btohqsg
Facelifted 135/235 electric Westgate too 😅,btohqsg
ya sia  i first time heard,btohqsg
But we talking about n54 v n55 ma not n55 v n55,btohqsg
haha depends on the versions lor,btohqsg
but n54 gt more things to change,btohqsg
i think bc n54 can handle higher boost levels bc of the forged internals ba,btohqsg
Not sure about holding boost but most n54 are too heavy,btohqsg
n54 can hold till 600+ i think,btohqsg
