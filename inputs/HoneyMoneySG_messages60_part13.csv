As long as your category is dining,btohqsg
For the uob lady's card  what are the 2 categories should I choose to tag with instarem amaze card?,btohqsg
Amaze doesn't change any MCC. So the 2 categories you choose depend on what you want to spend on,btohqsg

Excel or google sheet is your friend,btohqsg
Even big mnc can have data leak or attack by hacker  how smaller company can be trusted  just my 2 cents,btohqsg
Ikr  feels like hsbc slightly slower then other banks for revolution card,btohqsg
It goes by the calendar month so you have until 31 Aug for the $500 spend,btohqsg
Do we still get 30 days of bonus interest if we deposit on 31st Aug?,btohqsg

For UOB evol card  using it to pay for recurring utilities and phone bill  is it considered as online payment? Or other spending?,btohqsg
utilities no. phone bill depends which telco,btohqsg
Used to be decent with travel spending and high cashback for dining. But recently in 2023  there has been a significant decrease in categories and also amount of cashback for dining. With the trend  wonâ€™t be surprised if more nerfs are on the horizon when this card is already lose to competitors. Iâ€™d say there are better options out there like citicash back or miles cards or uob one.Pretty much only get if you have OCBC 360 account and you can hit 800 min spend (dining  groceries  transport and some utilities) for cashback on the card. 360 min spend is 500$ for bonus interest but tbh no point to just hit 500$ if you are getting almost nth in cashback for your spend.If you getting just for the signup bonus  get OCBC titanium to get some miles please. Maybe you can find more use case for the card beyond the signup bonus,btohqsg
What if the utilities bill is paid via internet,btohqsg
Currently I am using UOB One Account for the interests  but I didnâ€™t get the interests cos I didnâ€™t hit $500 even though my credit card spend was >$500 due to the statement month 11 to another 11 and UOB $500 spend have to be all within the month which I oversight. UOB One Card not my main.. I using it to hit minimum spend via telco  utilities  subscriptions and bus/MRT. The main card is Citibank cash bank  I always hit >$800 but recently decided to cut down my spending so food and grocery now canâ€™t hit $800 a month. Thatâ€™s why I thinking about alternative.. another was amaze + rewards for my oversea spends and shopping.,btohqsg
uob evol tnc already specifically exclude utilities from cashback. Paying online doesnâ€™t change the MCC of utilities so its still excluded,btohqsg
Oh I see. Didn't notice. That. Thanks for pointing it out,btohqsg
You can call in and ask them to change your monthly statement end date to calender month end. That way it will fit in,btohqsg
This is one way but I looking at what to do with my Citibank cashback. Cos UOB have to wait cycle end then I can increase the spend. I thought of cancel Citibank cashback and focus on UOB One Card but my cycle havenâ€™t ended lol.,btohqsg
morning all  can i check if all shopee transactions will qualify for 6 miles/dollar under fashion category for uob ladies card?,btohqsg
Normally my spend is between 1k to 2k and UOB seems not suitable also due to the 500  1000 and 2000 to get cashback.,btohqsg
First call in to change the date first then they'll tell you for the current month what will be the end date. Then you can plan your spending accordingly. Plus you'll fix your issue of not getting the interest on your savings account,btohqsg
If I focus on amaze+rewards as canâ€™t hit $800 then cashback for rewards only 2%+ haha.,btohqsg
If you got cook you can buy gift card/voucher to hit the minimum spending,btohqsg
Oh yeah.. one of the idea! Thanks~,btohqsg
Where do you buy vouchers or gift card? Directly at Fairprice store?,btohqsg
Would like to know which is the best cashback card for this too,btohqsg
fairprice gift card over fairprice counter,btohqsg
nope  only some mcc eligible. Shopee have different MCCs,btohqsg
Hi  is the local 100GB data and roaming data refreshed monthly?,btohqsg
