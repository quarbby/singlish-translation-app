then first day the workplace violated all safety regulations,btohqsg
and i didnt want to work anymore,btohqsg
Claim they breach of contract  unless you tell me washing toilet is in your contract,btohqsg
I already served half my contract,btohqsg
just dont have a job lor,btohqsg
sigh I actually have a decent relationship with my manager who is a nice old lady,btohqsg
I feel bad if I screw them over but being a maid for 3 weeks,btohqsg
A nice old lady would’ve hired an actual cleaner,btohqsg
LONG TIME NO SEE U STONE!!!,btohqsg
it's the company transfer me there  she has very little say in like the hiring but like... ya haiz,btohqsg
Then if she is really nice  she’d understand,btohqsg
ok like lemme explain the nature of my workplace,btohqsg
it's an after school student care center for pri sch kids,btohqsg
3 little study rooms with a pantry and a toilet,btohqsg
3 staff members: manager  a full time coworker and me the part timer,btohqsg
so like already  in terms of manpower  we have no manpower,btohqsg
Whats this work tea im drinking now,btohqsg
we basically run the whole place ourselves but like,btohqsg
I didn't sign up for this with a pay of $9 per hour,btohqsg
doing everything from senior management to physical labor,btohqsg
I know its a bit annoying,btohqsg
Why u dun see it from another side,btohqsg
Take it as training and gaining experience,btohqsg
what if stone's main purpose is to earn $?,btohqsg
I know it sucks big time to do stuffs that not stated in JD,btohqsg
about the senior management  because my manager is English illiterate  I have to handle all of her work,btohqsg
Wait I’m perplexed how can a student care be run by 3 ppl nani,btohqsg
Translating  copywriting  heck I've even done some graphic design,btohqsg
But it can really beef up your resume,btohqsg
U never know when u need some graphic designs in journalism,btohqsg
my purpose *is* to earn money but yeah sian,btohqsg
idt they will state the extra thing stone's done tho,btohqsg
U write ur own resume la,btohqsg
Definitely plenty of those things are going into my LinkedIn lmao,btohqsg
Don’t think as ure getting shortchanged now  but more of like gaining experience to earn more in the future,btohqsg
How long more til the end of your contract,btohqsg
2.5 weeks  counting this week as a 0.5 because I have vaccination on Thursday night,btohqsg
I know it sucks big time  but tahan a bit. Things will get easier when u really go find a ft job due to ur experience,btohqsg
thanks man... like I wish we could do something about it  but ya lah it's just a little more,btohqsg
And it also shows to ur future employers that u can handle shits la,btohqsg
do I really want to appeal to employers who see me as someone who can handle shit,btohqsg
Just pray that they will give you ex gratia,btohqsg
is that the kind of employer I want to attract,btohqsg
part time jobs are always underpaying ppl ma,btohqsg
if u want earn a lot of $ then freelance lor,btohqsg
But like u show that you can handle stuffs  in a way that is good. Not the negative manner,btohqsg
Cos most people i see is they hit a wall they just sit and cry,btohqsg
They dont do anything about it,btohqsg
Given that you really don’t want to throw the nice old lady under the bus  and just 3 weeks left  I think you feel like you don’t know but you actually know the answer. Haha we give you solutions but you hesitate  I feel like maybe you’re already prepared to just get it over and done with for the next 3 weeks.,btohqsg
maybe all I needed was to rant,btohqsg
