Anyways  that aside  do we get a national Public Holiday on the 22nd for the Parade?,btohqsg
Oh my  that's not what I mean.,btohqsg
i thought they already confirmed theres not gonna be one more,btohqsg
Oh  it's a Sunday  no wonder.,btohqsg
Can I say that I actually liked the NDP 2009 & 2018 songs,btohqsg
Apparently  they're considered the worst or at least not popular.,btohqsg
2018 is the remake of Count on Me,btohqsg
I just liked the R&B-Pop vibe of it,btohqsg
Back in the early 2000s it would have worked,btohqsg
Early 2000s was practically sensual R&B,btohqsg
Back during those days radios played R&B and hip hop,btohqsg
Not exactly R&B pop but close enough,btohqsg
Just because a subgenre shares the name of the main genre  it does not necessarily mean they sound the same,btohqsg
It's close enough + R&B doesn't sell in 2018 anymore,btohqsg
Yo  the NDP 2018 songs sound nothing like the R&B or early 2000s,btohqsg
I'll say they're closer to mid 2000s,btohqsg
Early 2000s were sensual and sexual in nature - Usher & Aaliyah are prime examples to mind,btohqsg
I would strongly disagree that they sound the same  one is a subgenre of the other. Yet  even then  I would argue that the NDP 2018 song is more Pop-inspired.,btohqsg
Well  let's be honest  any main genre in isolation was beginning to not sell well by the late 2010s,btohqsg
The pop style it was going for wasn't the pop style that was popular in 2018,btohqsg
The R&B sound was also not the primary R&B sound of 2018  so what exactly is it?,btohqsg
idk if its appropriate to turn here for advice but how do i convince my strict slightly anti-christian parents to allow me to attend church camp,btohqsg
i'm not exactly part of the church btw  but i attend their services,btohqsg
Wait  so you're Christian but your parents are not?,btohqsg
new believer is a more accurate term,btohqsg
i still have a lot to learn abt christianity tbh,btohqsg
other than that yes ur right,btohqsg
I see  ah  okay. Did you talk to your parents before converting?,btohqsg
Nicea Creed of 381 AD would be the best place to go,btohqsg
Oh my  that sets the beginning of the hurdle,btohqsg
Is the camp online or in person?,btohqsg

Ok  personally  I would say to inform your parents that it's for experience but I'm not experienced in this feel.,btohqsg
but some part of me feels that i need a more strong convincing reason that theyll actly find logical,btohqsg

People want to stand out so they'll actively search out alternative music until the alt genre becomes the new mainstream,btohqsg
