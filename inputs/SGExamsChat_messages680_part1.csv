Ok maybe gonna sound asshole but,btohqsg
The only person responsible for our emotions and how we regulate is ourselves,btohqsg
i feel like her stepping away from this chat for now is a good thing cause i dont think this is a suitable environment for her,btohqsg
i can gets feeling dumb and privately saying that but in public gc well..,btohqsg
Yes it's fine to feel like crap,btohqsg
It's fine to not be fine,btohqsg
U need to control how U act,btohqsg
How about after you give ç™½é‡‘ for my funeral? Only then I might be able to give u an answer by sending the universe a signal,btohqsg
Esp when how U act can affect others,btohqsg
50% meh? Weâ€™re just back to 2020 prices,btohqsg
it's just at some point it's too overly....altho I agree the word I use is abit insensitive,btohqsg
ok tbf i did use to rant alot about bad grades and stuff but to like my best friend (Or at least i thought she was)in private ... And then she decided to tell the whole class i was an attention seeker... when the reason why I ranted to her was because she scored higher than me ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
i've been working the entire day,btohqsg
I sat in rainer dumke lecture on schrodinger eqn,btohqsg
nah lol. not asshole at all,btohqsg
prioritising yourself and dealing with your own issues isn't selfish,btohqsg
i can show you the QM i'm doing,btohqsg
i have a study channel ah i dont rant about it but i do address it  i think the difference is if you are in a public gc you can acknowledge you dont know smth but not take it as a joke (?),btohqsg
how does that sound like an asshole ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
it's fine and normal to sometimes seek reassurance and get it out bc it takes a load off your mind,btohqsg
im sure youre self aware so dont worry ah,btohqsg
dont overdo ba. and dont do it with ppl that you not close,btohqsg
Actually tbh right  i would say this is a common trait among yi  but I would say some if not most would blame something else,btohqsg
i mean people also need to be more direct when they aren't equipped for someone ranting,btohqsg
"By all means if she were to come back in a ""btr state"" ( Ik really bad way to put it )   idt anyone of us would be that unwilling to chat as per usual",btohqsg
Like ppl say here say there we no culture and all  but they are also the same ppl who skip like our sch events,btohqsg
i do have that feeling too ah but i know its true then i just find other things i can do cuz it will overwhelm me too much thinking i couldn't hack it in jc ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Like literally ppl fail also blame yi  like srsly  you could ask ppl for help  go internet search  look at your notes etc etc,btohqsg
"not say self-centred  is more of if you cant self-regulate (TRUST ME ITS HELLA TOUGH TO LEARN IT IF YOU DONT HAVE IT) youd feel mildly attacked that ""easier said than done"" feeling",btohqsg
I mean tuition also can uh (if can afford uh but still),btohqsg
Is whether you have the effort to look at the information given to you,btohqsg
My Cher made me think abt stuffIf y'all complain so much abt certain cher  y'all gonna die in uni,btohqsg
Ah icic  is it me or I feel like self-love is a very foreign concept to many,btohqsg
Esp uk if majority of us are brought up in those asian typical households,btohqsg
tbh  some parts of the school sucked ah  i get the ideology of putting better teachers to better bands but.. not to the extent that the not so smart ones (me) cant even comprehend or learn how to learn (i was band 8 all the way  1 sem of band 5 made my mind blown at how much i could understand),btohqsg
Find little quirks abt u that,btohqsg
Is not a foreign concept  but tbh I never felt that before haha,btohqsg
Life is prolly a bit easier to live,btohqsg
i dont get the yijc slander. like honestly  so what if the sch isnt good at all? not good notes? check holygrail. the enviormnnt shldnt have an effect on u. is how u choose to act in it.,btohqsg
it's easier to recognise things about ourselves we dislike la,btohqsg
Oh yea actually right I realised,btohqsg
I had kumon sooo self directed learning! Teachers who?,btohqsg
"normal  i mean imagine for your earlier part of your life youre in a system where ""bad = failure"" (to put it more bluntly) and whilst having that you also have family pressures (for some la)  societal biasness  bound to happen that some can self love with the right environment whilst the rest well.. are stuck in the cycle of trying and failing (me lol)",btohqsg
Normally if we talking abt yi  they wont actually think about holygrail,btohqsg
Frfr jp starts math first topic with vectors :D,btohqsg
Maybe that explains why I straight up don't bother spending as much time w ppl ik still playing around ðŸ’€,btohqsg
But i would say in terms of yi  they are not very good at obtaining educational resources.,btohqsg
I saw some girl from my sec sch get 3 awards so my goal is to do well n get award + money,btohqsg
Seems like a win win to me,btohqsg
Often we are our own harshest critic ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
