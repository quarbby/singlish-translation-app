Lol why you want to take H3 math in the first place?,btohqsg
Yea‚Ä¶i cant imagine doing math in uni,btohqsg
The thing is‚Ä¶I actually dk  i was offered and just wanted to give it a shot (regretted tho),btohqsg
And also the class was full of the FM kids and the top classes people soüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
it's really just an interest thing  or should be anyway,btohqsg
Who knows maybe we get to introduce you as Prof Si Yan,btohqsg
siyan will always be senpai to me :),btohqsg
so not much benefit in terms of portfolio wise or uni admissions wise?,btohqsg
so what you are saying is  is that it is better for someone doing 3h2 1h1/4h2 with 70rp and maxed out portfolio pertaining to their course compared to someone doing 3h2 1h1/4h2 with 70rp and h3 distinction but no portfolio at all (in terms of rate of acceptance into dentistry/med/cs/law/other competitive courses),btohqsg
üëçüèª but do you only get exempted from a few mods in uni,btohqsg
i mean it can‚Äôt be the latter  right?,btohqsg
Depends on the course but 1-2 if it's related to your uni major,btohqsg
I would say portfolio matters more but ofc if u hv the portfolio + h3 in sth related then that is a +,btohqsg
i am trying to portray how cancerous that sounds,btohqsg
bruh that's like my ideal subject combu,btohqsg
H2 econs isn't that ideal sis,btohqsg
Its the brain damage from the H2. Stop doing H2s,btohqsg
We r starting on vietnam war later,btohqsg
Probably gonna start with Dien Bien Phu,btohqsg
If H2 econs is in the room Blink twice,btohqsg
theres more ppl taking h2 hist with h2 econs than without,btohqsg
I mean I am not a History Major so I fail to understand how is that a bad thing,btohqsg
If y'all go hong kong in the future  you won't see this bus company anymore,btohqsg
Nah for H3 math there is no exemptions,btohqsg
I mean it makes sense since H3 math and MA1100 are both heaven and hell,btohqsg
And also courses that are fixed curriculum etc most likely cant grant module exemption,btohqsg
Random but if you enjoy matcha  this matcha warabimochi (at Takashimaya) very shiok,btohqsg
so are you surethat pfme+ h3 math is your ideal combi?,btohqsg
Are you planning to do math major in university?,btohqsg
Actually  I‚Äôve gone and left haha,btohqsg
i thought h3 can be a part of portfolio  if its directly related to ur course,btohqsg
don‚Äôt know. that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm asking,btohqsg
i‚Äôm just checking  because if it doesn‚Äôt have much benefits  then even if my promo results are stellar i‚Äôm not going to take h3s,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt even have any idea on what i want to do,btohqsg
i think i‚Äôll decide on a specific course after my exams.,btohqsg
i alr have a h3 in mind and im doing relatively well in that subj,btohqsg
im pretty set on taking that h3 as long as i hit the reqs,btohqsg
u prob gonna start with how ho chi minh rise to power,btohqsg
The power relationship between decolonisation and Americas involvement with Vietnam is intertwined,btohqsg
ya cuz the america dw the vietnam to become communist,btohqsg
thats why they colonise south vietnam,btohqsg
The earlier involvement and abstinence was due to prior French involvement,btohqsg
Also Dien Bien Phu was fought by Vietminh forces,btohqsg
So idk what are u spewing,btohqsg
America was actually an ally during WW2 for the VietMinh,btohqsg
1) look at the h3 subjects on offer and whether it is of any relevance to ur desired course. Even if u are not certain yet  at least like ‚Äòa possible course option for urself‚Äô (some schs certain h3 subjects will not hit min quota anywaysüíÄ)2) As for the advantage  it will be more advantageous if ur h3 is somewhat related to the course u are going into  even if it isnt but u still did well  maybe a slight tiny advantage for courses that requires an interview stage.3) as for portfolio wise  yes it includes h3 / academic competition also‚Ä¶but a ++ to the portfolio would be stuff like CCA stuff  leadership  community service  degree-related competition (like i seen some of my batchmates participate in university tech comps in jc alr),btohqsg
is only because of japanese opposition,btohqsg
It was the ideal of a shifting landscape which is incompatible with your bipolar view of what the cold war was.,btohqsg
but the vietminh was funded by soviet union  china and usa,btohqsg
Also I would hesitate to call South Vietnam an extension of Colonialism,btohqsg
