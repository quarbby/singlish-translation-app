but i dont charge money or claim that its tuition,btohqsg
Well then I guess all of them are shit,btohqsg
Itâ€™s sad that students can be hoodwinked into paying almost $400/month for such shit tuition,btohqsg
so might as well ask sch teachers,btohqsg
mine is $15 for 6 years,btohqsg
Tbh I mostly ask@chemcerfor chem help,btohqsg
Tbh if i need help i ask my friends or my dad,btohqsg
wait Brooke j1 also or what,btohqsg
ik got 1 that sneaked the boyfriend into ri,btohqsg
Brooke we talking abt is sugaresque,btohqsg
The one who got into a scandal for plagiarizing,btohqsg
idk its govt funded but autonomous also,btohqsg
"And she runs her super popular tuition business with apparantly a ""decent"" gp distinction rate",btohqsg
No but this one also charge crazy for gp tuition,btohqsg
(Keep in mind that her students are majority from elite JCS so uh),btohqsg
Most RI students ik charge crazy for tuition,btohqsg
Ngl I wonder how my life would've been if I went to RGS or NYGH,btohqsg
I def wouldn't have met the ðŸ¤¡ boy and the other guy I liked,btohqsg
Cuz his tuition is more of like a,btohqsg
I wouldn't have met all my friends either,btohqsg
Yeah means it is. Autonomous means they got more autonomy in planning their sch curriculum iinw,btohqsg
And he also pretty decent AB rate,btohqsg
Yea cause IP mah so they can teach wtv they want in jh,btohqsg
I think 2023 a levels is 50% A 80% AB,btohqsg
"Yea but it's just a ""what if""",btohqsg
Isn't Tuition less bad than FA or property agent,btohqsg
Yeah but also some non IP schs have autonomous status,btohqsg
I don't regret going to DHS,btohqsg
I usually go to tuition centre,btohqsg
Lol I only charged 25/h for jc last time,btohqsg
My desk mate is from your school,btohqsg
shitty tutors can be worse than good FAs/property agents,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s pretty decent if he accepts students from all sorts of schs,btohqsg
His students are mostly YI and JP,btohqsg
Actually I wanna give pri sch Chinese tuition but idk ðŸ’€,btohqsg
He has/had abt 130 students rn,btohqsg
So he does group tuition right?,btohqsg
Have seen tutors with diploma only charging 50-100 an hour for sec/pri school,btohqsg
Meh I mean group tuition is like that if overrun canâ€™t charge extra,btohqsg
U can charge everyone extra no meh,btohqsg
Plus the tutor is also an ID/FA/property agent,btohqsg
Who even pays for this tho,btohqsg
Isnt pri sch tuition mostly 25/hr,btohqsg
Tbh autonomous is good aso  just more ex sch fees,btohqsg
Male tutor also with sweet wordz,btohqsg
But all may not agree to it  at least if itâ€™s 1-1 they can tell the tutor when to stop. All the group tuitions Iâ€™ve been to or heard of have a fixed lesson fee  only extra lessons then they can charge more,btohqsg
Haha jc I charge 25 cos most parents wanted female tutors,btohqsg
So bobian had to charge lower that time,btohqsg
