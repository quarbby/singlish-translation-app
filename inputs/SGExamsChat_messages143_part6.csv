When I went on exchange my lecturers quickly went on strike,btohqsg
And then straight after it was shut because of the pandemic,btohqsg
Angry about pensions. But they are happy with their salary though,btohqsg
All my lecturers went on strike for fourteen days,btohqsg
Confirm have a lot of people one,btohqsg
Singapore used to have strikes. Not really anymore,btohqsg
Nobody wants to fuck with the law,btohqsg
It's sad. Also a lot of content was cut from the exam,btohqsg
Yep  the Jones Polynomial is Field's Medal mathematics,btohqsg
I took it while on exchange. In the UK. It is considered a year 3 course  usually done by graduating students,btohqsg
That's why it is important to differentiate Riemann integration from the others when claiming that something is not integrable. The Cantor set is really interesting,btohqsg
Some random person really sat down and said let's prove 10 paragraphs of mathematics,btohqsg
For Lebesgue integration  it should be Lesbegue himself. It is not really a proof  but more of coming up with this.I checked about the Cantor set  it was discovered by someone called Henry John Stephen Smith  but introduced by the famous mathematician Georg Cantor,btohqsg
Not random. Geniuses essentially. It's not 10 paragraphs. It is a bunch of scribbled handwriting that is later translated into a academic paper or a letter or something. Mathematicians are known for their poor handwriting,btohqsg
Thinking about this  I'm not even sure if today's education system can effectively nurture geniuses.,btohqsg
If you're not in ENS I don't think you can make good judgment on it,btohqsg
Anyway I think there could be headway into complexity classes (in terms of recent math),btohqsg
Though the most recent negative result was disappointing,btohqsg
It is a shame that u don’t want to,btohqsg
guys does poly grades affect JC admission? (poly-jc),btohqsg
u want transfer from poly to JC?,btohqsg
But if u appeal outside JAE  then maybe the school will consider your poly grades,btohqsg
u can choose not to even if you'reextraordinarily underperforming,btohqsg
is night study a thing in all jcs?,btohqsg
most JCs have their libraries open until 9-10pm,btohqsg
but honestly idt teachers wld make u stay until night time,btohqsg
How to deal with post prelim depression,btohqsg
I have such low confidence when i do my chem tdy,btohqsg
u dont  it only goes away after it ends ;-;,btohqsg
idh prelims so i cant give much advice but just do ur best i guess  don't focus on the grades but focus on your progress and give urself some time,btohqsg
grow to not focus on ur grades and seek for small improvements every exam instead,btohqsg
Idk i do all the time,btohqsg
I have never seen any of my grades,btohqsg
Including A levels from a number of years back,btohqsg
If my em or am get B i will be damn depress,btohqsg
It is like the bad feeling you get after a certaim exam,btohqsg
It's ok to get depress over ur B grade  but just don't let others know about it,btohqsg
Because it might make them depress as well,btohqsg
It's fine if you get B. You know you've tried your best. I know it sounds clichéd but you have tried and it's over. Move on with life. It's not the end,btohqsg
Last time I would think it's the end. A levels taught me that it's never the end,btohqsg
And there are people doing worse also bah. So rather than complain about what u could not achieve  be grateful about what u manage to achieve,btohqsg
last year i tot Os is the end,btohqsg
Honestly I don't think A levels is so stressful. I can't speak for O levels but it should be more stressful with more subjects,btohqsg
i wish i cld get B,btohqsg
No haha  o level stress is almost nothing compared a level stress imo,btohqsg
O level stress comes from having to study many subjects many papers  is like marathon,btohqsg
A level stress comes from degree of complexity,btohqsg
alevels harder than o levels if im not wrong,btohqsg
and alevels also got alot of content,btohqsg
I was really enjoying project work,btohqsg
