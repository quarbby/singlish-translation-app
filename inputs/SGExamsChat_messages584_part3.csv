its way easier to argue the woke perepctive for essays,btohqsg
The lowest I've seen is E,btohqsg
I got like E or something for Chinese  usually in school I used to get U cuz didnâ€™t give a shit  so maybe this a true,btohqsg
yes but a good range of vocabulary still definitely helps,btohqsg
blud in too elite jc alr,btohqsg
bro the essays i wrote back then,btohqsg
Idt ej gives U for gp,btohqsg
I normally write whatever comes into my mind,btohqsg
like some alumni from jp told me they had a lot of S and quite a few U for gp,btohqsg
Has anyone ever had a friend/classmate who's delulu but still manage to ace GP?,btohqsg
I wrote abt how celebrities aren't overpaid before,btohqsg
Q easy to estimate what u will get for a levels,btohqsg
Cuz u will know how a essay in each band would look like,btohqsg
whatever i studied during the 2 years  i never used for A's,btohqsg
Ehh wtv u choose to define it tho,btohqsg
I only studied 4 essays in the 2 years,btohqsg
Most of the things I wrote during my gp a levels was based on a play that I watched like 3 weeks before,btohqsg
Also cuz arnd that time is was writing alot of history essays,btohqsg
It was during my gp essays appearing like KI essays phase,btohqsg
Ej lowest I've seen is S,btohqsg
I only know one C but the person like not thinking straight ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
chem is not too surprising but bio is sad,btohqsg
Ah she find it hard to relate in the first place Lol,btohqsg
in her world she probably cannot imagine people getting lower than 75rp,btohqsg
Im not from there but VJC definitely has to have people getting below that,btohqsg
yeah ofc la i just meant for her specifically  not most victorians,btohqsg
Ah abt h3 subj  if some ppl are alr v  good in all of their H2  is there a  restriction on the max no. Of h3/high-leveled subj  they can take for As?,btohqsg
Who told me abt someone like this,btohqsg
depends on academic units  u cannot exceed 12,btohqsg
u cannot change h1 to h2,btohqsg
The mark distribution is very obvious,btohqsg
1. Ej alr does banding by l1r5 for classes (pcme bcme etc)2. Classes are split into 3 tiers. Each teacher teaches one per tier.3. Some chers have a tendency to only focus on the strong classes so their weakest class dies,btohqsg
ya that's about to be ne,btohqsg
I realised this when I managed to pull the classes results in j1,btohqsg
Confirmed it when I became a teacher,btohqsg
And I confirmed it with my gp teacher in j2,btohqsg
So u need see the chers level of commitment,btohqsg
now why wld being upz make u eliteist,btohqsg
Like for me my chem cher she didn't rly teach our class cuz she knew we would more or less be okay,btohqsg
Then she focused on her weaker classes,btohqsg
bc she cant possibly imagine people failing As and not going uni,btohqsg
like she has no sense of reality  her reality is just excellence,btohqsg
Ik the second partI genuinely cannot imagine people getting U for lit and gp,btohqsg
Cuz cambridge said they gave someone 3 for essay before,btohqsg
for lit i also cannot imagine people getting U unless u really just leave the paper blank,btohqsg
It's rly rly hard to get S and U in a lebrls,btohqsg
but arts subjects the difficulty is the A,btohqsg
i think if ur an average student  B and C is very easy but the A is quite hard,btohqsg
like for lit prelims iirc we had 10% A  50% B   20% C and 20% lower grades,btohqsg
So the thing abt cambridge is,btohqsg
