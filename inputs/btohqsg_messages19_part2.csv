Hi there  is anyone able to advise what type of window will be provided (sliding or casement) at the kitchen for 3-room bto.,btohqsg
Depends to Architect design.... usually is casement,btohqsg
Casement in the kitchen? Does not seem to be very practical if there are hanging racks outside. Thank you Thomas,btohqsg
Casement or sliding is the same high of wall... so is practical for all kitchen to hang clothes out side  is how we use the space,btohqsg
You are correct Thomas it is the same high wall. With sliding windows you can slide them to one side so easier to hang larger items however casement windows more troublesome. Anyway thanks a million for your response,btohqsg
That consider as personal preference than practicality of the design.Btw  I'm not Thomas,btohqsg
In terms of safety casement is safer than sliding  plus casemate provide full open for ventilation but sliding not.Just wait for the virtual tour to confirm your window ba ...,btohqsg
Thank you so much Thomson for your advise. Greatly appreciated.,btohqsg

so just curious this levy i need to pay is it will goes back to cpf so i can use it for fund mine new bto again,btohqsg
You got buy a flat with grant before?,btohqsg
If you did  need to pay resale levy to hdb,btohqsg
so this rescale levy i paid back when i sell existing flat and get a new bto so this levy is not return back to our cpf or its fully taken back to HDB?,btohqsg
Yes  fully taken back to HDB,btohqsg
Payment of resale levyThe resale levy payable is determined at the point you book your second subsidised flat. It applies regardless of ownership type (joint-tenancy or tenancy-in-common) or shared interest in the flat. Payment must be made using your flat sale proceeds and/or cash. HDB housing loan will not be extended to the payment of a resale levy.,btohqsg
First subsidised flat was disposed of after key collection to the second subsidised flatResale levy deducted from the net proceeds upon the sale of the first subsidised flatAny shortfall to be paid in cash,btohqsg
First subsidised flat was disposed of before key collection to the second subsidised flatResale levy paid in cash upon key collection to the second subsidised flat,btohqsg
just curious normally before i collect mine key  to mine new bto i try to sell mine existing flat before i collect key right?,btohqsg
so after i sold mine existing flat then i collect mine key to new bto i can use the sales procees to pay the levy and the final payment to the new bto?,btohqsg
You have to plan well to sell your existing house before collect key,btohqsg
so usually before we collect key hdb will inform us right when we need to pay in full plus the rescale levy so i need to plan 6month before the key collections then if not i need to pay in full the rescale levyusuall hdb when will they inform us the key collections dates ?,btohqsg
