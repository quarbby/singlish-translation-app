If u don’t have ur own room   try to go for isolation,btohqsg
So I think impossible to spread,btohqsg
But is the quarantine place ok?,btohqsg
Wont there be temp taking b4 entering sch?,btohqsg

Oh ic i tot u wanted to cos of wa,btohqsg

yep i already signup for unidays to get student discount for macs le,btohqsg
but i hear macs not recommended for business eh,btohqsg

Important question!!Would y'all rather use dirty utensils or use plastic utensils which would harm the sea creatures?,btohqsg
ya my mother asking me if i want macs or hp or asus,btohqsg
mmm but got so many Asus model eh,btohqsg
still using my 2016 x1 yoga,btohqsg
my mother say her school lenovo is bad LOL she's a teacher btw,btohqsg
I got 2 Asus and till now they don't gimme any issues@jadorereve,btohqsg
but it's only my 2nd Windows laptop I use so far in my life,btohqsg
my first one was IBM thinkpad. Before they sold the tech and brand to Lenovo,btohqsg
The Computer I used at my intern place was a ThinkPad X Yoga,btohqsg
bc my sis's asus she say her battery life is not v good already,btohqsg
Yo is it possible for me to join cyber security in poly if i have zero knowledge in coding or all those computer stuff 😭😭😭😭 but i’m lowkey interested in the courseee,btohqsg
Anyone can go in cybersecurity but you must have passion if U wan bring it to the future,btohqsg
eh I went to see online they say microsoft surface laptop q good eh,btohqsg
Really basic laptop is 3 digit only,btohqsg
you definitely aren't the first to enter the course without any prerequisite knowledge,btohqsg
Ok can buy 1 chanel bag,btohqsg
I just checked the student pricing for apple  mac book air 512gb is 1.6k,btohqsg
idk if the warranty long enough tho if I buy from outside,btohqsg
if i buy from school when will it be estimated,btohqsg
When the system ALWAYS need to update,btohqsg
@mion6091Idk if uk tisAcer's Predator 21 X,btohqsg
1 year warranty lol  just checked,btohqsg
but i don't understand the rest that they're saying,btohqsg
Send I try help summarize for u,btohqsg
is getting from sch cheaper? but will they spoil easier,btohqsg
1 year free  warranty90 days for technical supportIf you buy AppleCare + it helps to cover for additional 3 years but got charge of $138 if it's screen/external damage or else extra $428 other damage,btohqsg
Idk how much AppleCare+ but I know it's not cheap,btohqsg
if i get from this kind of fairs student pricing does apply right,btohqsg
one benefit from buying from the sch is that the warranty is 3 years,btohqsg
it's not really needed tbh if u take care of the comp well,btohqsg
and for business courses idt need to run so many software till it will damage the comp,btohqsg
mine alr got prob dk why,btohqsg
i'm deciding between asus and mac nowwhy i considered mac is bc the student pricing is q appealing to me lol,btohqsg
and also i saw some video reviews and macs seem to last a lot longer,btohqsg
batt life and processors are the best in the market for the price,btohqsg
problem is I'm not too sure if it can process Microsoft apps bc i need to download Microsoft 365 which is a whole lot of Microsoft a} s which would probably be easier on Microsoft comps,btohqsg
and bc i'm going to a business course I'm not sure if macs is recommendedheard abt the constant updating of the comp,btohqsg
i have an android phone btw would it affect anything if u get a mac and tried to transfer stuff between my phone and the mac,btohqsg
I got Mac-10 AK47 Glocks and nines,btohqsg
all theze haters trying to knock me of Mai grind,btohqsg
Why not just use a Samsung tablet for school,btohqsg
And it’s bigger then black n white,btohqsg
Not sure about mac  but usually poly roadshow laptops are older model,btohqsg
All the best to our A Level friends today! May your desired rank points be the one that you see today....#manifest✨Rules and guidelines,btohqsg
has anyone gotten their poly jae appeal results yet,btohqsg
So umm I hired this tuition teacher,btohqsg
Then I said to the tuition agency idw him but my mother dw to pay for 1 lesson when I gave her my money,btohqsg
The tuition agency said they will commence legal actions,btohqsg
Do you guys have any similar experience?,btohqsg
Like do you guys know what are examples of legal actions?,btohqsg
They will probably report your for unpaid lesson I think? Or even have a record that your this kind of student,btohqsg
Guys I got Covid so do I need to go booster or do I have to report to MOH? Is reporting to my teacher sufficient?,btohqsg
Somemore I gave her money one,btohqsg
You can't take booster if u got covid. Just call MOH and report it and postpone ur appointment,btohqsg
Then will my vaccination status be affected,btohqsg
1) you might get blacklisted -> agencies won't wanna find you tutor anymore2) you might receive a letter of demand threatening legal action if you refuse to make payment3) if the tutor feels really offended  might expose you online too  who knows...,btohqsg
anyway  why you want to terminate?,btohqsg
Because I don’t find him suitable,btohqsg
It’s only the first lesson btw,btohqsg
oic. inattentive tutor  smh.you're totally justified in terminating if you think not suitable.but still need to pay for the first lesson lor,btohqsg
Why you gave your mom money for tuition?,btohqsg
ya sia. how old are you 😂 why is you give mom money,btohqsg
Cuz the mum dw pay then I think he/she just wanna pay back the mum,btohqsg
Cos mother has other things to pay lah,btohqsg
You can just use the pronouns they if you don’t know their pronouns,btohqsg
Usually if you don’t know someone pronouns you use they/them,btohqsg
Who’s umbrella is this?They must have forgotten it.,btohqsg
Isn't they meant for more than 1 person?,btohqsg
Honestly he/she is fine also in this context,btohqsg
Don’t you know there are ppl who use they/them when they don’t identify themself as a girl/boy,btohqsg
Isn't it alright to put he / she?,btohqsg
Eh shit tution center going court ah,btohqsg
He or she must have forgotten it.,btohqsg
No because not everyone uses he/she,btohqsg
They must have forgotten it. = More then 1 person forgotten it,btohqsg
Cannot meet up and pay in cash? Ownself take $ back from her then pay?,btohqsg
Hey hey wasnt the main point about tuition fees  how did it evolve to pronouns now?,btohqsg
Idk manz I being attacked for using he/she,btohqsg
I understand everyone has a preferred pronoun  but its honestly not wrong to use he/she in a gender objective/neutral context,btohqsg
How 2 get A for Chinese,btohqsg
Is that some kind of new porn application?,btohqsg
I tot in terms of grammar is he/she,btohqsg
That's what I tot too but since THEY doesn't wanna be counted as HE/SHE we shall just call THEM as THEM,btohqsg
Chinese A can use e dic,btohqsg
Uh good for you? Besides we weren't talking about that in the first place  but somehow escalated to this😅. We were talking about tution fees ? Maybe try not to take things so seriously haha chill aites? .No ill intentions,btohqsg
I just feel ppl should be educated about pronouns more so the LGBTQ+ would feel more comfortable about it,btohqsg
If I'm writing an email to someone whom I don't know their gender,btohqsg
Do I write Dear THEY or Dear Sir/Mdm,btohqsg
I hope you understand where I'm coming from.,btohqsg
to whom it may concern lo,btohqsg
Imagine Chinese compo without E DIc,btohqsg
Have to pay coz the lesson was already conducted,btohqsg
If want to fight means fight partial payment  but why do that lol legal fees cost even more than 1 tuition lesson,btohqsg
Which is also reason why the tuition center might not pursue  but some people abit stubborn uh,btohqsg
yes  but ruining own reputation by refusing to pay tuition fee for ONE lesson also damn not worth  isn't it? coz they can expose on social media and everything.,btohqsg
ofc. can unds your mum not easy also.just wondering how come you have money to give herdon't angry >_<,btohqsg
Also I’m the one who need tuition,btohqsg
It’s kinda my fault for not being able to pay attention in class,btohqsg

That kind of make sense actually,btohqsg
Common sense I still fail ok,btohqsg
I teaching you how to do well for E math and H1 math,btohqsg
better than a C or even a D 😏,btohqsg
Why annual pass and season pass still at further notice.,btohqsg
waterworld close down so long alr also,btohqsg
But something to be proud of,btohqsg
A NT student can do H2 math?,btohqsg
anyone can do it wif hard work,btohqsg
want to take fm means must get A for h2 math,btohqsg
pls I got an e8 for emath I’m doubting if I will pass h1 </3,btohqsg
If I want a 80rp ?,btohqsg
Lowest in my class thou lmao,btohqsg
I still dream about tat A thou,btohqsg
One A with everything else B,btohqsg
Anyone uk got U in chinese,btohqsg
Your condition I think most likely should be pes c9,btohqsg
Yeah  the only guy I know who got A for H1 Math,btohqsg
Quick question:is it true that if I accepted an offer from a uni last year  I can still apply this year and not have my previous offer void?,btohqsg
How much rp is Chinese h1,btohqsg
Its not gonna add anything unless u got A or B. B is under a specific condition i think,btohqsg
Most people just aim to pass chinese,btohqsg
I think it adds like 1.25,btohqsg
thats how worthless it is to most people haha,btohqsg
If I o lvl HCL b3,btohqsg
A lvl is it a b ?,btohqsg
So just study enough to not get U,btohqsg
Idk the equivalency but u dont need worry abt h1cl lol,btohqsg
u add the rp u got from h1 chinese to ur total rp. then divide ur new total rp by 100 and multiply by 90. thats ur final rp,btohqsg
I mean u shd study more on the other subj than chinese haha...,btohqsg
honestly if they had more incentives for mt i wldve studied ykwim,btohqsg
like what i work hard for an A and all i get is an extra 2.5rp or so added onto my results?,btohqsg
dont understand why moe makes it so either,btohqsg
basically the higher ur rp the lower the effects chinese will have on ur overall rp,btohqsg
its like saying “dont study its pointless@,btohqsg
So basically h1 Chinese is usless ?,btohqsg
whats the max it can affect,btohqsg
usually people just aim to pass,btohqsg
wtf then why not just cancel Chinese,btohqsg
if u get 0 rp from all other subjects  then u can get 8rp from chinese,btohqsg
u get straight e’s or smth,btohqsg
then your chi will prob give u 4rp or smth?,btohqsg
actually its a good thing lol cos most students taking h1 chinese usually not good in chinese,btohqsg
so its good that they made h1 chinese insignificant,btohqsg
Eh each week like idk how many periods,btohqsg
true   do Uni even look at it,btohqsg
err if u straight Es then,btohqsg
they make u take h1 chinese,btohqsg
in the end its legit just 1rp in reality,btohqsg
wait fk I just rmb I need take h1 content a lvl next year,btohqsg
ok actually maybe some unis do,btohqsg
but apparently still need pass no,btohqsg
LOL I still need to do o lvl math,btohqsg
like they will just require u to get S or smth,btohqsg
they say last year sci 90 retain,btohqsg
thats why people dont aim that high,btohqsg
O level math who teach u sia?,btohqsg
every cohort will have about 1/4 to 1/2 cut off at yr 1,btohqsg
okay and i got 44.9% for my h1 and they didnt let me promote,btohqsg
I thought is 3h2 main thing ???????,btohqsg
ik the h1s quite rabak this yr,btohqsg
how are ur other subjects tho,btohqsg
but he take h3 math one,btohqsg
So must look at h1 also ????,btohqsg
actually js worry about passing all ur subjects,btohqsg
i never said 3h2 pass cannot what,btohqsg
I scared Kena retain h1 math,btohqsg
u think u can cnfm do well,btohqsg
not alot of ppl pass 3h2,btohqsg
So many people warn me about failing,btohqsg
