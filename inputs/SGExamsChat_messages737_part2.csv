Randkmdkd said ejc used to have rly good geog chers but they left,btohqsg

Feel like every single geog dept getting shit on,btohqsg
don't teach her the ns ways,btohqsg
manadr did not exist in my time pal,btohqsg
Siyan im gonna be sick next tuesday,btohqsg
uhh what kind of work is it,btohqsg
idk how retail works bc scheduling can vary a lot  but usually MC is a separate thing,btohqsg
you should just go camp on the PIE and see if anything happen,btohqsg
or listen to the radio for accident then go find,btohqsg
but i think if you start laughing irl there you're gonna look like a psycho,btohqsg
Van driver arrested for ramming traffic police car,btohqsg
dude this is a good sticker pack,btohqsg
nah i just find the pictures that ryan sent to be so comedic for some reason  it looks like it was shot at the right timing,btohqsg
maybe he's the one walking across the PIE looking for good shots,btohqsg
my fren called me crazy when i said 10¬∞C is not that cold,btohqsg
yea if the contract doesn't say anything about MC = longer notice then they can't do anything if you don't do it,btohqsg
i went to a southern chinese city that was exactly this temperature a few years back  and it was the exact temperature for a good hibernation,btohqsg
people associate the low temperature with wind,btohqsg
it's a lot colder if it's windy,btohqsg
w/o wind is actly quite nice,btohqsg
if the wind starts blowing in a winter city  prepare to be screwed,btohqsg
i experience as low as 5 6 Celsius. with wind,btohqsg
10 C is like the temp where you wear or don't wear a jacket,btohqsg
5 Cish is where i'll wear a jacket for sure,btohqsg
but some people can't handle that,btohqsg
A S'pore-registered ship collided with a bridge in Baltimore  causing it to collapse.Rescue operations are underway to find 20 people & multiple vehicles.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3x43I4Q,btohqsg
pls i was in the UK and some guy was just walking arnd in tshirt and shorts,btohqsg
yea i'm a bit like that,btohqsg
i was up a mountain in switzerland and just wore my t shirt,btohqsg
wind is like the biggest thing la,btohqsg
they ºre most likely used to it,btohqsg
i was in geneva then it kept fluctuating between raining and wind and sun,btohqsg
to nuclear bomb dropping on sg,btohqsg
while my friends and i were going in and out of shelter and stuff,btohqsg
the locals just sat in the park through the rain like it's nothing,btohqsg
as tho they knew it was passing,btohqsg
is that your house block number,btohqsg
If there were some casualties suffered by people on the bridge  the captain is definitely going to have some survivor‚Äôs guilt. Imagine crashing into a bridge and as a result people on it died  whereas you and everyone else onboard the ship remained unscathed.,btohqsg
no signs of nuclear bombs dropping on sg,btohqsg
Matcha ur condition sounds really serious,btohqsg
yeah please see the imh üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Ok maybe going to imh is a bit abrupt  why not start with seeing a psychologist,btohqsg
She doesn‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs physical or psychological yet,btohqsg
I feel like im sugar coating and down playing the condition alil tbh,btohqsg
Just see a doctor in general so they can do the appropriate referrals,btohqsg
Just do it this week imo,btohqsg
