Kids  never do something you have no interest in from the start - it is not easy to progress unless you really open your heart and are willing to except it (which is easier said than done),btohqsg
At at the end of the day most of u do is just the lesser of a few evils,btohqsg
U need to learn how to tolerate doing things u dont like and power thru,btohqsg
Not for national examinations when each evil matters,btohqsg
That is true  I am trying to suck up to Accounting again but the drive is just not there for some reason,btohqsg
Dont pick what u want to do base on interest,btohqsg
"In the words of every Commando Man I know  ""You learn to just say'fuck it!'and move on""",btohqsg
The Market may not necessarily align with what you are inclined towards,btohqsg

For starters  you could see what programs you can uninstall that you don't use. Esp if you still have bloatware,btohqsg
Only to realise the discord is closed,btohqsg
ok that was a sudden capitalising,btohqsg
Settings app and go under storage section,btohqsg
Most laptops come with a ton of pre-installed software that you won't need.,btohqsg
Oh  when it is officially closed?,btohqsg
They gon start crying on the spot,btohqsg
Iâ€™m so proud of you for not giving up ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
There is no such thing as a stupid question  only stupid people,btohqsg
I just typed made up quotes,btohqsg
"""You only need to ask stupid questions once if you are alert""",btohqsg
I might actually start crying if they donâ€™t tell me how I can help with the technical difficulties,btohqsg
Because we canâ€™t tell the OS from telepathy,btohqsg
