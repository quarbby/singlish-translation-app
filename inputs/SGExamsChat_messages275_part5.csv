I just finished cleaning it up. Currently trying to figure out a way to solve subgraph isomorphism problem to detect functional groups,btohqsg
Easier to reach larger audience that way,btohqsg
Help us debug . All u have to do is write out a bunch of molecules and see if there are any obvious errors in printing. Eg carbon with 5 bonds or benzene with more than usual hydrogens,btohqsg
Alternatively if there are any better  simpler ways to do things just create an issue,btohqsg
"Haha I don't act do/unds chem sadly ;""(",btohqsg
but I can try to help in the debugging if needed,btohqsg
which is why u can contribute by optimising the code instead maybe hahaha,btohqsg
Is this counted as brisk walking?8 km under 45mins,btohqsg
I walked from XX mrt to XX lrt,btohqsg

And my friend is complaining I'm walking too fast,btohqsg
And he is having the luxury to sit the bus rn,btohqsg
yeah 8km in 45 min is defo jogging pace  it's 2.4km in 13.5 min,btohqsg

If you think finishing 8km in 45 min is jogging,btohqsg

I walk at least 5km everyday-?,btohqsg

Aren't there already software like this?,btohqsg
If u ask me why I didn't take the bus,btohqsg
that's me going to my work place,btohqsg
i tired of the traffic so i bought a bike to cycle instead,btohqsg
it will pay itself off in like 2 years assuming i go to work everyday (which i don't now cause wfh),btohqsg
sg weather no go though  need to bring spare change,btohqsg
cause the route is on a slight incline  confirm will sweat,btohqsg
yea not when you're sweating into your work clothes,btohqsg
no one wants to sweat during commutes,btohqsg
But u can bring extra clothes,btohqsg
Well I bring 2 sets of clothes to sch,btohqsg
But but it's windy in the afternoon,btohqsg
it's more like why bring when you no need bring,btohqsg
yea i don't regret choosing to cycle to work but it does come with its downsides lor,btohqsg
And cuz the weather aso unpredictable,btohqsg
anyway i can also go recreational cycling with my friends so even more win,btohqsg
