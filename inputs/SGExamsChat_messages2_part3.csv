duplicate soul and sell it both,btohqsg
nvm only one way to find out,btohqsg
Puts into perspective how godlike this Y4 senior I know doing DDP with FCH for both degrees.,btohqsg
Those are the kinds who could have went other places,btohqsg
I think I'd be happy if I even get one FCH,btohqsg
i'd be happy not to get kicked down to 3rd class,btohqsg
And to make you feel more underachieved  that guy isn’t just studying all day. He is also very achieved outside of acads. He did not sacrifice anything for good acads man.,btohqsg
i've learnt a long time ago not to compare myself  as a mere mortal  to gods likes this,btohqsg
Next thing you are going to tell me is that,btohqsg
Not only is he getting double FCH,btohqsg
He also squeezed his ddp into 4 years,btohqsg
we're not made equal  just be content with what you have,btohqsg
I tot they would show like AAAB or smth,btohqsg
Then there is this other Y3  had 5.0 GPA until he too gei kiang. That guy is a humans god but Math is his Achilles heel. Decided to take Math mod to prove that he can maintain 5.0 even with Math. Struggled badly got B. Perfect GPA vanishes.,btohqsg
idk why i bother with ddp in the first place kek,btohqsg
Struggled badly but managed to get a B,btohqsg
Sounds like a success story to me,btohqsg
B in Uni is like D in A levels,btohqsg
What math mod did he take,btohqsg
Yea one of my friends didn’t realise that and kept her Bs instead of SU-ing it. It hurts your GPA bad.,btohqsg
u mean it's better to SU rather than to get a B?,btohqsg
If you feel like you are good in your major and can get an A for most mods then you can SU your B's,btohqsg
Else it might be better to keep your B’s so that your GPA is more stable,btohqsg
Hahaha yes the ironyYou spend A levels running away from SUbut you worship SU in Uni  more of S actually  but U also saves your GPA if you end up failing lah.,btohqsg
so basically if you doing well  then SU cause can depend on other modsif cmi  then keep B so at least u got smth to fall back on,btohqsg
Actually B just SU alr lah  B+ is the grey area,btohqsg
So what’s a D in Uni,btohqsg
for uni apps hor  I can submit first then edit later on right,btohqsg
A+ AA AA- BB+ CB DB- EC+ SC Something below S but still passD+ UD UF U,btohqsg
GPA is your grade points  then divided by number of modules (not exactly but it gets my point across),btohqsg
If you SU your B it won't count towards the denominator so you'll be dividing by smaller numbers,btohqsg
Your GPA will then be more easily affected by a B,btohqsg
Not just a B  also Cs,btohqsg
Its q simple. If you aiming for fch you SU ur b+. If not  you keep it.,btohqsg
It’s not that simple taking into account that the majority of your SUs is applied in Y1 and while you may want to aim for FCH  SUing a B+ might bite you down the road.,btohqsg
Can you SU your core mods,btohqsg
I don't think so  cos a B+ wont pull you from a second lower to a second upper.,btohqsg
So its basically a dead grade,btohqsg
With B+s around  you can pull your GPA up with A- easier. Without B+s  you might need to straight up get A to pull it up.,btohqsg
Can anyone tell me what is the % for a C grade out of 30% for a group project?,btohqsg
No bro hahahaha. A b+ will pull ur gpa away from A- and closer to 4.00,btohqsg
Cos there are more mods diluting ur A- if you dont su.,btohqsg
The only scenario a b+ is useful is if you get a bunch of Cs or B-,btohqsg
Then it serves as a buffer,btohqsg
tfw someone calls a B grade a D,btohqsg
Cmon man 3.5 isn't the end of the world,btohqsg
a D grade in A level isn’t the end of the world either,btohqsg
because of my d grade dad wants me to retake As,btohqsg
If you can get to where you want  then no point retaking,btohqsg
idk lah he said like this i will get shitty job,btohqsg
