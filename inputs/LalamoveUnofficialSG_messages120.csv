For me is always early morning,btohqsg
But idk about posb since I using ocbc,btohqsg
Early morning ah? I jus check. Haven in. 😔,btohqsg
Just check lo. Maybe at night in or what,btohqsg
U using posb/dbs ah? U got ur pay liao?,btohqsg
I changed bank details already. Previously using posb normally Wednesday morning will credit in also.,btohqsg
As in every wed morning ? Or random timing de? Afternoon? Evening ?,btohqsg
Could you show me a screenshot,btohqsg
Wednesday morning. You try wait see tomorrow or Friday lo if dont have try asking Cs?,btohqsg
You may have accidentally hidden it,btohqsg
But by right if I'm not wrong when you cashout it says will receive money by 7days or working days. Plus you cashout before the cut off date which is Sunday so you should receive already mah,btohqsg
Mine looks like this  gotta wait for nicegram to update haha,btohqsg
In case it said failed to cashout,btohqsg
Nope  never state failed to cashout,btohqsg
"Actually I find it quite complicated prefer the old group. Now it seems sbit confusing and kind of ""mafan"".",btohqsg
Yea.. sometimes I also thought my app cannot see other messages oso,btohqsg
But I got the hang of it tbh quite quickly,btohqsg
I think it might be better to revert back to how the group was like before  and then set up other groups for other purposes and then pin the link in the main group.,btohqsg
Yea I prefer old one too,btohqsg
Could you see the general chat now?,btohqsg
Cannot see  I think it's really just my app,btohqsg
My app also lag til like the conputer i used 20 years ago,btohqsg
Sorry to trouble you to screenshot again 🙏,btohqsg
General chat cannot be seen liao,btohqsg
Frankly speaking  I prefer the old chat group. It's more simplified and not so confusing. For marketplace  non LLM job request and vehicle rental maybe can create new group and pin all the link in the main group. So for those who are interested can click on the link and join those group.,btohqsg
I'll consider the feedback🙏 I'll take a few days to observe how it goes.,btohqsg
Maybe can consider putting up a poll to get vote as well,btohqsg

Noted thanks. Oddlie seems to be on santa naughty list . So bad..,btohqsg
Do you all want a seperate topic for the banned list?,btohqsg
I prefer just 1 group like how it was before and have the ban list in the pinned messages 🙂,btohqsg
I agree  too many sub chat need to keep switching quite confusing,btohqsg
You have the option of pinning the tcss on top,btohqsg
I mean I prefer to have the group revert back to how it was like before. Just like what Max said above.,btohqsg
Would appreciate your patience for the time being.,btohqsg

so nothing to comment here except when I'm free lo,btohqsg
Uncle I say if they nv pay u for legit job done.,btohqsg

Open mouth close mouth scold ppl and act lao jiao,btohqsg
One of a kind. Keep barking,btohqsg
If u understand human language let me give u a chance to learn.,btohqsg
He asked whether customer do cash payment and nv pay after order complete. Can get paid by llm,btohqsg
And if u do long enuff u know it's not 100% cos even if u r right u may get rejected.,btohqsg
So keep ur mouth clean by brushing ur teeth. Dun bark. Talk like I said. If u cant talk keep quiet. Usually I send barking dogs to sleep. Good riddance.,btohqsg
Prob no mirror. Fingers point at others forget to look at itself.,btohqsg
Yes not himself. Itself. I didn't typo. Cos u bark,btohqsg
Hi checking. If I cashout today. Do payment receive immediately.,btohqsg
Meaning u cash today  u get next wed,btohqsg
U cash yest also next wed,btohqsg
If u cash 12am later  u get paid next next wed,btohqsg
For those who are new to llm  he is not wrong llm is cui  the rates are not perfect but it's higher than some other platform like Amazon  uparcel or deliverychinatown. The agents service are practically non existent. Can earn cannot earn depend on urself and luck. Jobs availability and whether you can stack multiple orders  especially those driving as the op cost is high  no stack really difficult to earn unless u r looking at picking up jobs otw to office or home then it is meant to cover ur petrol cost.,btohqsg
Llm long distance not worth it.. pay too pathetic. Less than $1 per km,btohqsg
I notice some merchant like to low ball with stack orders. I saw 89 Pasir Panjang send to ocean dr and then bishan for $23 gross,btohqsg
Llm can only do near ones more worth it or if you go to far away place then on the way do 1 cover petrol and earn a bit,btohqsg
At the end of day  you are willing partners to use the platform. If not happy  no one force you do also. Can quit anytime and take back your $75.,btohqsg
Knn no need you to teach me what to do or what should I do,btohqsg
Indeed. But worth it anot depends on u. For me if I'm gg Changi I got a 20 plus Changi job I take. At least my petrol paid for. If specially pick up job to go there I wun lo,btohqsg
That’s why lo. Not happy don’t do. Simple. No need argue or be hostile.,btohqsg
Maximum stack only 2 right ?,btohqsg
I find that multiple jobs in a single order not worth most of the time. Some difficult to park also like orchard but they are still low balling their price,btohqsg
Pre scheduled not limited to 2,btohqsg
But usually the most u can do is 3. Especially for oddles else u can't meet the delivery timeline,btohqsg
Parking diff in CBD n orchard,btohqsg
Max restaurant if can take immediately still can try park Infront of the restaurant run in tk run out,btohqsg
Far east also can park along the road unless guard come poke,btohqsg
The rest is better if u take multiple orders and cover Ur parking if exceed grace.,btohqsg
Yes.. or be like me hoot until i sot,btohqsg
And must be same pick up location,btohqsg
If not how u run 3,btohqsg
Ho ho.. my pickup sometimes one left one right,btohqsg
I do with fren so I stack when I do that,btohqsg
If I do alone I stack 2,btohqsg
Wat to do they want courier kana these kind of walkers anyhow hoot,btohqsg
Okay ma 2 better then 1 oso,btohqsg
If the restaurant on time when reach ok . Sian if told have to wait 10min,btohqsg
stack also need to be super careful,btohqsg
sometimes nearby but still need 15min,btohqsg
the few times i stack not food one ok,btohqsg
I cfm more then 15 mins that's why I ask sender can hold on awhile anot first lo,btohqsg
a bit late but nobody say anything lol,btohqsg
All day take your time then okay lo,btohqsg
Within 1 hr to finish or 30 min ?,btohqsg
If muti stop extra 30 mins each order (except for doctor anywhere at bukit marah),btohqsg
Llm really got funny ppl one . Yesterday got a order . Ask to go buy shoe for him as limited   each one pair only,btohqsg
I kana one also ask me go buy cigg,btohqsg
Buy at anywhere just hoot only  end up buy until over $100++,btohqsg
Buy mentol izzit at 7-11 ? Delivery to botanic garden there ?,btohqsg
Btw as long as customer cancel us we got comm ?,btohqsg
Oh so cancel no comm . Then waste the trip halfway there,btohqsg
Walker they ask you fuck off,btohqsg
I kana alot of times le,btohqsg
I walker ask them for compensation also like want kill their parents zzz,btohqsg
Car how to ask them compensation sia when they cancel us,btohqsg
So usually I call b4 I go over. Like I'm omw is the order ready. Shops like yum cha dun take cos they dun pick up phone n not puntual,btohqsg
I also call unless from getz all those,btohqsg
Have to submit proof lo. May or may not get,btohqsg
Or bento they text me first then I ok,btohqsg
Get oddle can call but call restaurant. Not oddle or get,btohqsg
Summit proof alr also dw give,btohqsg
Delivery Chinatown got chat grp to poke,btohqsg
why this 8 lor baka batu the rates so cheap $3.50. $2.8 after comm,btohqsg
See this low ball until like this,btohqsg
I taken Yum Cha  a couple of times. But thereafter they cancelled. I skipped when I see 20 Trengganu.,btohqsg
Most orchard merchant don’t take into consideration erp or traffic jam or no parking one still low ball fares,btohqsg
Walkers like us to cover up those complex areas..,btohqsg
Oh ya got walker.. I see some of their remarks damn rude say no walkers to accept,btohqsg
Rates are given by llm. Lol if llm NV implement that  which customer will specially give u extra. As customer  KPI is save money.,btohqsg
Got cancelled and delay b4. They dun even answer calls so I stop taking yum cha,btohqsg
Courier order ma. If car u wun take courier specially unless u r at the area or it's otw ma. If not Bo hua,btohqsg
You should've stall the drop off part to make them pay first..,btohqsg
If not this trouble come out also headache =_=...,btohqsg
A simple solution can make this entire thing avoidable.. =_=..,btohqsg
Was deceived by his politeness over the phone.,btohqsg
I would just say you either pay now or I stall the drop off sequence lo..,btohqsg
Let the recipient kb you lo,btohqsg
But don do it in front of the recipient la.. ltr they snatch and slam door,btohqsg
He's the recipient but was not present @the drop off. I passed to his workers.,btohqsg
I wouldn't pass it to the workers even.. or go near the entrance... threaten them you uturn back lo..,btohqsg
Lol... 3 small fans still can keep quiet but from industrial area sure those fans cannot fit in a car,btohqsg
Totally normal... people book courier expecting moto to carry more then 8kg lol,btohqsg
At first I thought only telegrams groups got low ballers. Lalamove have plenty too lol,btohqsg
See this so pathetic fare yet so demanding. No wonder nobody take,btohqsg
are the fares set by LLM or the senders dictate the price?,btohqsg
Sender can dictate also if I’m not wrong,btohqsg
Seriously fck all these low-ball senders man. I drive a car and they want me to deliver a TV.I understand now why they never provide any details in the job description.Please read carefully first guys before accepting jobs.,btohqsg
Don't accept jobs if there's no description provided,btohqsg
I believe sender can manipulate the fares.. if not you won’t see lowball fares everyday.. also llm bot system to dictate fare isn’t fair. They don’t take into consideration jam  erp  no parking  easy summon areas,btohqsg

Guys  may I ask if for immediate order but I waited for 20 to 30mins at the pick up location can I claim for the long wait fees?,btohqsg

Hoho.. they didn't pay me the waiting time 😂,btohqsg

If you arrived earlier  it’s your problem,btohqsg
No lah what I meant was because it's cash job mah. So I'm not too sure if it's possible to claim because I think if LLM pay us then they claim from customer I think some customer might just go Mia,btohqsg
Then cash job cannot claim la.,btohqsg
Customer also not so stupid to pay,btohqsg
Ya sorry I forgot to indicate it's cash job when I ask here earlier on. My bad,btohqsg

Thought no courier job  den ok lah,btohqsg
Actually if this happen also good. Because sometimes drivers take courier jobs so some customer will try to be cheap and order courier service then when we arrive unable to proceed because no trolley and all that end up waste of time and petrol,btohqsg
So now car cannot see courier job?,btohqsg
Got courier order or not last 2hrs?,btohqsg

If give me $100 I also don't want do sia,btohqsg
When did lalamove start this? Can see courier job earlier around 6pm...,btohqsg
I think not bad la. If not we always flooded with the courier orders which are lower in prices. And also there won't be so many cheapos placing items meant for cars onto courier,btohqsg
Anyone knows Guo Circle what type of delivery pls?,btohqsg
Any old bird here? Need help. I'm new. Wanna check  how come it's show wallet icon and state pay by credit  but below put cash on delivery,btohqsg
