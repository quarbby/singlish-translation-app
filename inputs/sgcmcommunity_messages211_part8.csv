for purchase of used cars  is it the standard to pay deposit then send to my own workshop for inspection. possible to send to workshop first? i dont mind paying some cash to cover their logistics.,btohqsg
Have to place deposit first 😊.,btohqsg
can write down in black and white  if engine/gearbox problem you reserve the right to cancel and get a refund for your deposit. If have wear and tear repairs needed  seller and buyer to split 50:50,btohqsg
If they don't agree just walk,btohqsg
High chance selling you a lemon,btohqsg
"i just thought their terms of ""A full deposit refund will be done in an event if the vehicle is found to have engine/gearbox/chassis damage"" a little too vague. and i dont really know how to check before even paying the deposit haha 🥲",btohqsg
At the rate u r going  U r better off buying a new car,btohqsg
🥺🥺🥺 but i get what u mean,btohqsg
Ignore him. He’s a weirdo. Just take ur time to investigate,btohqsg
Deposit don’t pay. Once u pay Liao  u r arguing from a  disadvantage. Basically it’s v hard to prove engine or gearbox problem. It becomes ur duty to open it up n show them exactly where n why is it considered spoilt. Btw oil leaking   shaking or weird noise does not mean spoilt - just observations.,btohqsg
Dealers mostly are good at twisting to their own advantage,btohqsg
Buyers will always lose to sellers,btohqsg
So what do you suggest to be the agreement when buying from second hand dealers? I also read engine and gear box problems will be difficult to find and prove.,btohqsg
Research n buy tools to do ur own inspection. The experience n tools will be v beneficial in future.,btohqsg
Okay. What kind of tools are available to test the engine and gearbox. I believe these two are the most expensive parts to service if they are a problem,btohqsg
Universal obd2 scanner. Inspection mirror sets. Endoscope. Stethoscope. Smoke leak tester. Magnet detector. Portable jack. Most impt is research to gain experience. Make a checklist of all parts needed to inspect. Another checklist for test drive. Take pics n send to ai to inspect.,btohqsg
Thanks this seems to be a heavy undertaking though 😂. Some dealers offer 1year warranty on engine and gearbox. For a few extra dollars this would be a safer deal right.,btohqsg
I heard stories of dealers delaying repair until warranty expire,btohqsg
Da fck. These guys.. Seriously 😒,btohqsg
Next time buy 2nd hand  bring Pete along w you,btohqsg
Confirm get a used brand new car,btohqsg
Can start first with the obd2 scanner. It’s the easiest. Cold start check for error codes. Warm up n check. Whack the car n check for codes again.,btohqsg
Yeah I also thought OBD2 seems the easiest one of the lot. And a long term investment for maintaining a car.,btohqsg
Get a good obd2 scanner. Can plot n analyse graphs of all the impt sensors. Check if it’s within normal range,btohqsg
The mechanic won’t do until so detailed. They got many cars to settle. I bet they can’t tell u what should be the normal range of the sensors. The brake mechanic don’t even know what is the correct torque for tightening my wheel nuts. If u don’t tell them  they just use impact gun to tighten to the max. Next time u will cry if nut break n get stuck in the wheel when trying to unbolt,btohqsg
These mechanics r usually lowly educated bengs who donno n can’t be bothered with official range of values of impt components n sensors n importance of using correct torque on bolts. They will say “kid  I been repairing cars for 20 years”,btohqsg
Big names not necessarily means reliable e.g. cartimes,btohqsg
Talk ez. Most of the time  the best deal is not from reputable places. On the contrary  worst deal from reputable places is more common,btohqsg
Hahahaha I never buy from reputable shops. The cars they sell I can do a engine n gearbox overhaul n still cheaper when I buy from other dealer,btohqsg
after so long pete still never change pattern... a leopard never changes its spots one la,btohqsg
If you want to reduce your risk of getting a lemon  avoid profiles such as >1 owner  mileage not too high  serviced regularly etc  go for reliable models e.g. Toyota etc.,btohqsg
Everyone has their preferred means so no right or wrong,btohqsg
Ytd I saw 2 Toyota towed. Was quite surprised,btohqsg
By any chance  did you see any honda towed yesterday too?,btohqsg
yeah i believe is low mileage,btohqsg
