Might be controversial but I think too many ppl with mild mental health issues are being given pes F when they should be given E instead,btohqsg
Can put him in non combat vocation  my friend’s office he said got one super athletic and buff guy rare blood type and got pes E instead of F,btohqsg
And also if you got private doctor report they can help exaggerate,btohqsg
Even heart issues should be pes E,btohqsg

Unless there’s sth very serious we don’t know it’s quite likely he exaggerate some shit and got pes F unfairly,btohqsg
