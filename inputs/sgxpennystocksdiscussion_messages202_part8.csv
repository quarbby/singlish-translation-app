Sg yuan   for medtec u mentioned it is on bigger wave 2 correction  does it mean todayâ€™s correction is end of wave 2? Thanks,btohqsg
Thanks ... so it means tomorrow must hold .96  then itâ€™s valid ? Or must still wait for repeated test n support at .96?  Trying to understand the chart,btohqsg
Its a valid w2 already. This week donâ€™t break 96 will have chance.,btohqsg
Sorry  can I ask   w1  w2  w3 duration in terms of days may be different ?  Ie wave 1   hit 1.03  in a day  and wave 2 formed today... and you said if by this week  can hold .96  meaning   wave 2 can be at least 2 3 duration unlike wave 1 which was only one day?,btohqsg
SgYuanMedtecs - If 960 breaks  what are the next support points? Thanks.,btohqsg
W3 may or may not come. Sometimes can also breakdown and go downwards.,btohqsg
Yup  understand ... if .96 breaks   then wave 3 wonâ€™t happen n I believe will have to rechart again,btohqsg
Thanks sg yuan   appreciate the effort,btohqsg
