iirc there was another system like leomatch before such a matchmaking on telegram became popular,btohqsg
i never liked leomatch from day 1 for how eerily similar the experience was to using dating apps,btohqsg
i once saw primary school aged users on leomatch,btohqsg
bro got 16 yr old on there say they want 6 inch meat WTF.. FREAKY SIA GO STUDY,btohqsg
FBI need to arrest the bot makers cuz wtf,btohqsg
some people put nudes out there on leomatch,btohqsg
u report their profile also no use,btohqsg
why am I getting ppl younger than me..,btohqsg
14 year old FWBs?? AHBOI GO PLAY ROBLOX,btohqsg
IM SO SCARED LEOMATCH IS SO SCARY,btohqsg
ok tbf even if you input your age that is older than 18  they'll still show you profiles of 16-18 year olds,btohqsg
you can't delete your account on leomatch sadly,btohqsg
ü´° Sedia! All past and present national servicemen will be receiving $200 in LifeSG credits by Nov 30.https://str.sg/dinn,btohqsg

"""Bullying sometimes starts from the parents.""But is it just parents? In this week'sIn Focus  CNA explores whether teachers are equipped to handle bullies  and whether ‚Äì other than parents and counsellors ‚Äì police  lawyers and even politicians should be involved:https://cna.asia/3AkrxHO",btohqsg
as in you're still deferring for further studies,btohqsg
today's society has no humanity or normalcy left,btohqsg
nah because kids be identifying as furries and changing their races,btohqsg
that is so weird.. like I'm okay with trans & gays but CHANGING RACES?,btohqsg
idk why are people turning actual issues to stuff like rcta,btohqsg
how do I even talk to them,btohqsg
but ok  a lot of concept with stuff like therians (anthropology and liking furriee )  vegan & lgbqt aren't inherently badi admit that sometimes it gets illogically unsound but it's usually the same group of people that make such stuff seem like it's seen in a bad light,btohqsg
Vegan and lgbtq is normal but acting like an animal is just plain weird tbh,btohqsg
have u heard of baby space,btohqsg
baby space are those ppl who are older but love to imitate being younger than their actual age (usually children or babies),btohqsg
it's not childish immaturity at the point,btohqsg
baby space / little spacethe feeling you sink into when you're feeling safe  loved and childlike.,btohqsg
Idk if we should consider everything like a race üò≠,btohqsg
but if I see a furry in singapore I would literally RUN.,btohqsg
i would rather mix with therians compared to those littles,btohqsg
Vegans and lgbtq is fine but other than that I don't see a need of more identities and stuff,btohqsg
ok  this one i definitely agree,btohqsg
Yeah it does but not everything must be a race ah,btohqsg
the rest are just got mental health problem,btohqsg
Uhhh not really? But like behavioural related issues?,btohqsg
"no way someone looks at themselves in the mirror and thinks ""I wanna be a cat and use a litterbox""",btohqsg
"or ""hm.. I think I wanna be oli London and be Korean""",btohqsg
because neodivergence got so popular at one point where everyone just begun making their own funny pronouns like k/y/s and indirectly snarky remarks about these same group they're using clout fot,btohqsg
Oli London is the original RCTA üòç,btohqsg
Honestly idk how this whole thing works but everything must have limits ah,btohqsg
I don't get anything abt pronouns just use he/him or she/her or they/them,btohqsg
if you don't get it  you don't have to hate it either,btohqsg
like there is no way I'm gonna call you xi/xe/xer,btohqsg
or like make nasty remarks  no?,btohqsg
It's not bad to explore identity but I think as humans we should be able to draw a line with what we are exploring to be,btohqsg
nah I keep to myself but I find it weird tbh..,btohqsg
there needs to be a fine line to be drawn,btohqsg
maybe I'm traditional like that but yeah..,btohqsg
ok to be fair  there's no way anything aside from he/him  they/them  she/her will be normalized,btohqsg
I mean yeah but let's be a bit professional while talking about sensitive topics like this yeah?,btohqsg
