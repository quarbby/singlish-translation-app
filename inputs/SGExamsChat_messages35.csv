My own physics tutor was from hc,btohqsg
ri chers jst ask u self study,btohqsg
YJ math papers are also quite difficult,btohqsg
It's not how difficult the questions are it is how much they teach,btohqsg
I feel the environment there is pretty homely,btohqsg
The bad thing about the school,btohqsg
The results from the school aren't great  but if you go in with a heart to learn,btohqsg
I think u will do fine,btohqsg
Have u heard about the cohort reaults this year,btohqsg
Yeah my friend from YJ also went applied physics,btohqsg
And there were 20+ who got above 80rp,btohqsg
I took them back in 2018,btohqsg

Ntu i walk untul legs tired,btohqsg
Anyone here went for the PSC PAE thou,btohqsg
If for NUS u get called for interview,btohqsg
Does it mean ur first and second choice has been rejected,btohqsg
Or is it just a normal interview,btohqsg
Take a timer and time 20 minutes and focus for that 20 mins,btohqsg
If you remember something you need do or get distracted by something  then write the distraction on a piece of paper and continue with your work,btohqsg
These two helped me to really focus,btohqsg
And a lot of times even when the 20 mins is up I wanted to continue lol,btohqsg
But even if you stop after 20 mins it's OK  cause that's the point - to focus for 20 mins,btohqsg
Slow mode permanently on during exam season,btohqsg
Alternatively we debate if Actemra is a viable drughttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/roche-evaluate-actemra-severe-covid-135601117.html,btohqsg

How bout slow mode during submissions season too HAHA  where my Uni homies at?,btohqsg
We expect university students to be able to take care of themselves,btohqsg
You put too much faith in us and your future self,btohqsg

I just downloaded zoom but my web cam won't load. Webcam can still work on other apps though. Any tech whiz able to help 😔😔,btohqsg
I can't download zoom on my windows,btohqsg
This is clearly the Zoomer era,btohqsg
I think there's a setting in zoom that allows you to change the webcam u using,btohqsg
make sure it's using the correct one,btohqsg
yeah I only have one and its just showing a black screen,btohqsg
I cant download zoom in windows,btohqsg
Did you get an error message or?,btohqsg
I tried but my computer disallows the installer from working,btohqsg
did u try restarting and seeing if it works again,btohqsg
Try turning off your anti virus?,btohqsg
and make sure u downloaded from the correct website,btohqsg
You know this period has got me wondering,btohqsg
I alr restarted my laptop once,btohqsg
Where was Zoom before COVID19? Ok zoom is not perfect  but it's miles better than Skype,btohqsg
i've never heard of zoom till now,btohqsg
companies who need zoom alr paid for it,btohqsg
apparently zoom isn't very reliable security-wise tho,btohqsg
everyone else use skype because free and good enough,btohqsg
like there's no encryption of messages so zoom can see everything we talk about haha,btohqsg
oh i thought it was free,btohqsg
oh no they're going to learn about chemistry,btohqsg
free tier is 100 ppl up to 40min,btohqsg
so all the tuition centers and uni who use zoom need to pay,btohqsg
more like not learn cos my chemistry is unreliable 🥴,btohqsg
I think it's fine for the average user  it's not like they will talk about national secrets or whatevs  and besides alot of companies are already spying on us anyways -shrugs-,btohqsg
is there any way to use phone cam during interviews,btohqsg
Some schs also use Microsoft Teams,btohqsg
tbh I use a webcam from like a decade ago,btohqsg
the faculty discourages zoom on phone,btohqsg
mmm mine is like 7 yo,btohqsg
but I'd just use whatever webcam u have on your comp,btohqsg
It works fine tho  useful when I wanna learn in bed LMAO,btohqsg

singapore's context is very different from most other countries though,btohqsg

We rely on people to drive economy,btohqsg
