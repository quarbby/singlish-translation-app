whoever got recieve ans key for physics pls send here asap thanks,btohqsg
yall need change ke to m/s,btohqsg
The idea of SI is for all the equations in Physics to be standised,btohqsg
Btw 95km/h is 25m/s right or smth like that,btohqsg
I put kelvin for unit is it wrong,btohqsg
first q was SI base units?,btohqsg
Cause I didn't study that part n it looked a little sus,btohqsg
But its not a base unit too,btohqsg
Is my mark gone since I never convert,btohqsg
6 SI base units that are in syllabusmole  metre  kilograms  seconds  ampere  kelvin,btohqsg
but if you write as an answer  should still be given the mark,btohqsg
never see question yet  I can't tell you,btohqsg
There's 1/2 Mark in physics right,btohqsg
1 out of 2 yes0.5 no,btohqsg
Theres no 0.5 out of 1?,btohqsg
still enough time to work hard to get full 30% from MCQ,btohqsg
U forget to 3cm I forgot to x 5 🤡,btohqsg
how do y’all solve the mass question ?,btohqsg
yo any jc student doing h2/h3 physics can anyone remind me whats the equations for acceleration and velocity in a circle ah,btohqsg
a = v²/r or rw² or vw   where w is omegadon't think have formula for v.,btohqsg
v is usually given or found from other things,btohqsg
thanks man  but do yall do curvelinear?,btohqsg
need this for my uni stuff thanks alot bro ❤️,btohqsg
Hmm  I can help a little with uni physics,btohqsg
ah that means no  then its ok,btohqsg
really uh you mind if i PM you?,btohqsg
i struggling with uni level physics,btohqsg
only year 1 I can try,btohqsg
If it is totally mechanical engineering then I can't help.,btohqsg
maybe can show some sample questions  I can try later,btohqsg
mode bro  i didnt touch engie stuff for like 2 sem and i forgot how to integrate ahhaa,btohqsg
integration should still be able to help. I'm actively teaching students that  so still can,btohqsg
Integration within physics likely should still be ok.,btohqsg
but if it is professionally ME  then I can't,btohqsg
oo vector calculus. Reminds me Phy olympiad daysBut this one generally out of my league,btohqsg
triple integration maybe still can do as a maths question  but I think there are maths degree people here who are able to help better,btohqsg
ya fk that shit idk what on earth is going on anymore sia,btohqsg
Yall in JC solving god level equations alr,btohqsg
driving to fetch kids from childcare. Later I write out some study tips which help me go from dunno what happen to scoring A,btohqsg
Is vectors more complicated in jc,btohqsg
I already forgot all my JC equations😵‍💫,btohqsg
Evolution of vectors from sec to jc be like stonks,btohqsg
Anybody take triple sci in JC? How do u gods survive that sub combi,btohqsg
u need math and a contrasting subject,btohqsg
I heard some ppl take trip sci,btohqsg
Alvl 'triple' sci is 2sci + math,btohqsg
I read  somewhere from reddit  that ppl took phy chem bio,btohqsg
Or I might be wrong la,btohqsg
maybe they took in o levels,btohqsg
Most likely IB or the Alvls in UK,btohqsg
and take the triple sci as a private candidaate,btohqsg
Now cannot cause not allowed anymore plus new system?,btohqsg
anyone has the ans for combi physics,btohqsg
Plus it is just stupid to take 3 sci,btohqsg
Some ppl rlly take back then ig,btohqsg
it was 90 km/h = 1500 m/s,btohqsg
planning to take h1 chem and h2 math,btohqsg
My school can take triple science,btohqsg
My bad  yeah JCs can only take 2 science plus math,btohqsg
90km/h is 25m/sI can't imagine a car on the expressway going at 1500m each second 😅,btohqsg
that's your 1.6km route in just a little over a second,btohqsg
i think so. My last plane trip was like 2015,btohqsg

same i’d like to know too,btohqsg
honestly are there any other differences between jc and MI other than the time in each school??,btohqsg
There Ur smart kiddos in mi^,btohqsg
i mean ok a lot more to unpack than that,btohqsg
@mersculago ask those two smart ppl,btohqsg
gimme a sec i settle smth first then i come back to y'all,btohqsg
But Damn I would want to go mi if I can turn back time,btohqsg
what did u mean by this^^,btohqsg
last time damn rabz in the sense that ppl dun care about schoolnow damn rabz in the sense that it's more competitive,btohqsg
u take your h1 contrasting subject a level  your MT  and PW in Y2,btohqsg
then H2s and GP in Y3,btohqsg
hmm so it’s more of there’s no difference between jc and mi culture?,btohqsg
Lions do not concern themselves with the opinions of sheep,btohqsg
I heard some jcs after orientation straight away mug like shit sia,btohqsg
i think MI still more chill than JC bah,btohqsg
this is true of almost all JCs,btohqsg
Mugging in MI vs in JC?,btohqsg
i read MI horror stories on reddit before,btohqsg
No such thing until shit gets real,btohqsg
not sure how to feel ab that,btohqsg
got horror stories of all JCs,btohqsg
More than 80% for last year,btohqsg
Very relaxed. But if you can qualify foe JC  work hard and dont waste 1 yr,btohqsg
Alot can go jc but choose to go poly,btohqsg
Is it normal for ppl to get their driving license in jc/poly/MI,btohqsg
That's if u got extra monei to spend,btohqsg
You are not even of age to get license at that point,btohqsg
if i’m not wrong it was ab the school being dismissive on certain issues lol,btohqsg
If those issues dont affect u then it doesnt matter,btohqsg
For JC most people who want license get license after J2,btohqsg
I got my driving license right after NS last time,btohqsg
J2 u will be too busy,btohqsg
In jc and MI  is it more of self-directed learning?,btohqsg
all JCs are a lot of self learning,btohqsg
JC i think more self directed than MI,btohqsg
Its self directed everywhere if u want to self learn,btohqsg
baby jindon't go jc for the sake of gg cuz will suffer one. (Speaking from personal experience),btohqsg
it's a pre uni study afterall,btohqsg
There's a lot of avenue for help,btohqsg
It's just that teachers won't really chase u or anything,btohqsg
But the teachers will be there to help if U nid their help,btohqsg
I think MI has a lot more avenue for help than JCs,btohqsg
I mingle w other sch ppl unlike u,btohqsg
I have direct experience with students from multiple JCs,btohqsg
Issok come join the grp we hike end of the Year with@chemcerand the rest,btohqsg
what’s the rate of students in MI who make it to uni each year,btohqsg
or for your year at least if u can recall,btohqsg
if have a choice  choose NY,btohqsg
u get 50rp u aso can go uni,btohqsg
Of course. The learning quality and peers differ,btohqsg
i just wanna do dentistry lolz,btohqsg
Why r ur questions so extreme,btohqsg
NYJC is very good in value adding,btohqsg
When u do project work  u will want people who mug hard and want to score,btohqsg
Poly route is better in this case,btohqsg
i did my research for oral health therapy,btohqsg
They can produce results that might even overtake RI when given students with higher l1r5,btohqsg
Eh sry I mean like the person said every jc got bad chers. Am just asking for the sake of asking.,btohqsg
and the most you can become is the primary school dentist u rly wanna work under the gov lol,btohqsg
Top 3 are HCI RI NYJC,btohqsg
which is not what i want,btohqsg
and NUS dentistry doesn’t accept poly grads,btohqsg
VJC and NJ are fighting 4th 5th,btohqsg
MI btr then yijc in terms of( last year rp),btohqsg
MI better than YI for q a number of years liao,btohqsg
I think MI is getting more competitive in recent years,btohqsg
if there’s an option for that trust me my life is SET.,btohqsg
I dunno but Ik they btr,btohqsg
yeap most dental students are JC graduates,btohqsg
YI  if you work hard  can score too,btohqsg
I just had a YI student who scored damn well,btohqsg
Sadly poly grads have 0.1% chance,btohqsg
the first poly student to go to NUS dentistry was back in 2018 if im not wrong,btohqsg
a level supposed to be 3 years anw not 2 years,btohqsg
and it even was on the news lolz,btohqsg
Is a fit between sch and student,btohqsg
maths is easy to score generally 😅,btohqsg
The A percentage differs alot sch to sch,btohqsg
Not sure  last two batches I taught all scored A except 1 B,btohqsg
Are medical students mostly from jc too,btohqsg
Oh yeah MI PW is a shitstorm just a heads up,btohqsg
Look at national data then is obvious,btohqsg
u can’t do much from poly@merscula,btohqsg
JC teachers give a lot of resources mostly,btohqsg
So far only 1/2ite students made it to meds via the VERYYYYYY LONG route,btohqsg
But every year i share my experience of JC education on the ground as a teacher,btohqsg
yeah samw i had big dreams too,btohqsg
U can basically eat the B if u go to a lower tier school,btohqsg
Pm me if u are interested,btohqsg
MI pw is not only teacher dependant but if u get students who r planning to GTFO after 2nd year or just dun care,btohqsg
Ure up for some fun times,btohqsg
A significant portion are kicked out of year 1 also,btohqsg
wait how do they gtfo in just 2 years,btohqsg
Work hard and anything is possible,btohqsg
They dont matter coz pw is second yr onwards,btohqsg
of course that’s the key but some of our options r sort of limited,btohqsg
personally I appealed hard into RJ last time with L1R5 13 pts.,btohqsg
my school didn’t offer pure sciences until 2020’s batcg,btohqsg
Not a nice term to use,btohqsg
We call it the thanos snap,btohqsg
Half the cohort missing after nov holidays,btohqsg
Is PW one of compulsory subj for jc,btohqsg
So anyone aiming for JC can pm me to find out more,btohqsg
Anyone aiming for IB can ask mi,btohqsg
MI BCME fellers can msg me,btohqsg
Tho if i reply or not is see my mood,btohqsg
if the jc cut off point is like 20,btohqsg
like does it matter like do i not get the full package LOL,btohqsg
if u go JC  be prepared to work super hard,btohqsg
Having good time management is a must?,btohqsg
JC education is different from O level,btohqsg
Dont fall for the mugging trap,btohqsg
The purpose and objective are different,btohqsg
So many students experience a big gap in standard and expectations,btohqsg
That's the acjc way of life,btohqsg
U can go jc for the first 2 weeks,btohqsg
for me  I believe in mugging hard. <2 short years technically,btohqsg
A level is just going to army,btohqsg
it sets your final path to uni,btohqsg
And A level.may impact your life,btohqsg
U dont have to MUG to do well,btohqsg
i know i got the feeling he did,btohqsg
Honestly JC is a very good time to socialise,btohqsg
If u r mugging u arent learning/exploring,btohqsg
Usually ppl who retake need not improve,btohqsg
Definition of mugging is relative I guess,btohqsg
And why retake when others moved on with life,btohqsg
what 💀 i wanna go jc so i don’t have to make friends in poly every module LOL,btohqsg
I didnt scam anyone. In my defence john said im from ACJC,btohqsg
It's different if u can tell people u wore the SG blazer to represent SG in physics olympiad,btohqsg
I mean i'm not saying u have to socialise in JC,btohqsg
yeah idk i get super anxious,btohqsg
still have to encounter that in uni,btohqsg
But that's how i know u,btohqsg
Sometimes it's good to take a step back and digest whats  taught  in the  past 2 years? Some ppl need more time? haha,btohqsg
but still dentistry is the goal and i rly wanna do it no matter what it takes lolz,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionwhen u wan come out socialise with ppl,btohqsg
You dont know me. You dot even know my real name,btohqsg
JC is not a piece of cake. I have to remind that in case anyone thinks it is a walk in the park,btohqsg
Wdf don't be misled by neil's lies,btohqsg
U can always do back up,btohqsg
i mean i have interest in architecture but i’m not necessarily passionate about it…,btohqsg
If u dont know what u want then how r u going to work towards a goal,btohqsg
sorry for making u guys my ecg counsellor 💀👍🏽,btohqsg
1. JC -) fail-) overseas uni/go poly and try again for uni2. Poly -) private candidate A level -) uni3. JC/poly -) uni,btohqsg
i do actually - dentistry 🏃🏽‍♀️,btohqsg
always have a backup in case u don't qualify,btohqsg
Must have an end in mind,btohqsg
Then u shouldnt have doubts haha,btohqsg
oh btw i take combi science it’s 100x tougher for me to go JC,btohqsg
@wolkfieu can start studying aft Os if u diedie wan,btohqsg
Before u go JC  u need to decide what subjects to take  which comes from which courses u want in uni,btohqsg
The famous Papa Mama scholarship 😂,btohqsg
the jump is so big it doesn't really matter anymore,btohqsg
If combined science is a 1 and pure science is a 2  H2 science is a 10,btohqsg
Thats the biggest scam they tell u,btohqsg
U dont need bio to go to bio courses,btohqsg
But bridging courses need not be available in JC leh,btohqsg
U need physics to go to every course,btohqsg
The qn is if take combined sci and take h2 sci in jc,btohqsg
Physics and Chem open the most doors,btohqsg
I learned it the hard way,btohqsg
Chem is the most impt sci.,btohqsg
Bio is useful for subject prereqs only for fulfilling '1 H2 science',btohqsg
One more piece of advice  contrasting arts subject  I think econs is best,btohqsg
Econs is best for after JC,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHAH is econs similar to POA,btohqsg
But of course if u better at bio than phy then it's quite silly to take phy over bio just because of that,btohqsg
Can say byebye to engineering and computer sci,btohqsg
econs is understanding how the econs work,btohqsg
Its fine comsci is a pain anyway. I cant even do h2 comp,btohqsg
Wow good  sia I can't do computer or engineering,btohqsg
Maths is understanding how the maths works,btohqsg
PLS the syllabus changed it’s bot the same anymore,btohqsg
honestly I have used basic econs theory for stock markets buying,btohqsg
im happy to be the last batch to take my syllabus,btohqsg
I thought CS only prereq is H1 maths,btohqsg
Nus comp sci is a coin flip,btohqsg
U nid amath from sec also,btohqsg
when u cant even do linked list  how to do comsci,btohqsg
oh A math is considered a science subject?,btohqsg
I have classmates who nid retake add math,btohqsg
U dont learn linked list until like sem 2 anyways,btohqsg
U need not have the content from h2 but u need the rigour and logic of h2 and maybe h3 for com sci,btohqsg
i remember learning that in sem 2 yes,btohqsg
I learn the a level basic one i cry already,btohqsg
Alevel comp sci is a joke,btohqsg
I assumed that was subsumed under H1 maths,btohqsg
And my life the the joke,btohqsg
Reinforcing my inability to do the syllabus,btohqsg
ya its all fun and games until u do this,btohqsg
https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/apply-to-nus/singapore-cambridge-gce-a-level/subject-pre-requisitesAnyway it's 'good pass in H1 maths' for CS,btohqsg
ok anyone want to know more about MI commerce or just MI in general can text me ok bye,btohqsg
Text me for jc 😜 text NC for IB,btohqsg
But at least now after taking h2 computing  i learnt to avoid computing. Saved 4 years worth of pain and money,btohqsg
H2 pass in Computing or Mathematics or Further Mathematics or Physics;OR a good pass in H1 Mathematics.,btohqsg
its the only way to solve LOL,btohqsg
Lai papa solve for u later,btohqsg
I'm working on an electronic product rn,btohqsg
then after that one on assembly code,btohqsg
used the knowledge to hack maplestory 😅,btohqsg
Does business in uni have good prospects?,btohqsg
ahhhh so overwhelmed w what to do lolz jae i’m gonna have 5 damn days to pick a choice,btohqsg
Which is what u need to complete in uni,btohqsg
and sold mesos for few hundred dollars then,btohqsg
Which is what u need to have before uni,btohqsg
Ok thks i need something to ditch programming for,btohqsg
Does it make a diff if ppl decide to shadow doctors when in jc,btohqsg
If they're aiming to become medical students,btohqsg
Ah do study abit b4 jc starts,btohqsg
If anyone needs any advice on JC choices after getting O lvl results can PM me. Or@mathconsultantsgtoo  I think,btohqsg
omg i rmb there were some VJC students w my surgeon LOL,btohqsg
if want to prepare  prep for maths,btohqsg
Imagine u going under then a bunch of jc students staring at u,btohqsg
I can send u medical student requirements,btohqsg
trigo and coordinate geometry are important,btohqsg
Then they say the jc students opperating on u,btohqsg
