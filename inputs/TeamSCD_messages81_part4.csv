Like that will die single bro,btohqsg
thailand scarier  will really be like the c180,btohqsg
That one not upbadge already  is whole chassis swap,btohqsg
outside and inside look like c63,btohqsg
That's why very important to find out,btohqsg
U find out liao  u sad. The driver also not affected,btohqsg
There you will question why girls don't look like them,btohqsg
I think he eventually will have ppl disturb him one la,btohqsg
I think if u aesthetic only but just for yourself happy nobody will make noise,btohqsg
But if u go around and announce it then thats another problem,btohqsg
Put a red badge on a fd4 then poke ppl‚Ä¶ very different story,btohqsg
Same like fd then all make look like type r,btohqsg
but the problem is  normally your face thick enough to put the badge alr,btohqsg
i think also thick enough to say you got amg sia,btohqsg
Then you drive around like you balonglong got 1 AMG badge like that  dk is trying to intimidate people  or haolian or what,btohqsg
This one is assumed ba. Plenty of red badge honda just keep to themselves,btohqsg
Sohc spoon also have  but never disturb ppl nobody cares,btohqsg
Maybe his wife or gf wants that car but he not enough. So upbadge so he/she don't know üòÇ,btohqsg
Well if they did that  then they deserve any ridicule that comes lor.,btohqsg
That's why very hard not to judge,btohqsg
It's the same as judging people with fake Rolex or LV or smlj,btohqsg
I mean ya  at the end of the day they happy can liao lor,btohqsg
but the question is always why,btohqsg
Nobody like fake stuff in general ba,btohqsg
same as fake exhausts and fake vents and etc,btohqsg
I am 99.99% sure that if they could reasonably afford the real thing they would,btohqsg
I put it another way  if a guy who like FD2R overstretched beyond his means to buy a real FD2R vs spend within his means to buy a FD1 and put red badge  i not going to judge him.,btohqsg
Or someone really like submariner design but cant afford  so he buy a triple A,btohqsg
Exos and vents are fine. Dont use rep rims,btohqsg
I guess we have to agree to disagree ba,btohqsg
I wouldn't have respect for someone that bought a lancer ex  then slap on evo body kits and put evo badge,btohqsg
Like sure  you can love evo x alot  but that doesn't mean you can't build a sick car out of a lancer,btohqsg
Compared to someone with stock lancer ex bodykits and badging  then you slap on a turbo kit and make a 300hp sleeper,btohqsg
i think i'll have more respect for the other guy,btohqsg
I guess the difference is my respect for a person dont stem from the car they drive. Its their personality,btohqsg
I think the way you build your car says a lot about personality too,btohqsg
Some ppl want to drive an evo x they cant afford  they overloan  they borrow from friends they dont return money. So u look at his car u see real evo x  u give respect,btohqsg
Rather than fake it to make it  why not embrace whatever you have and build however you can,btohqsg
Then thats very external respect only.,btohqsg
of course  until you get to know that person deeper,btohqsg
I'm not hating on lower specced cars or anything,btohqsg
But to me  ‚Äúbuild‚Äù is not the bodykit or the badge,btohqsg
I just don't see why you have to fake it till you make it idea,btohqsg
but that's what alot of people are calling their builds ma,btohqsg
When someone says ‚Äúbuild‚Äù i take it as functionality. U talk camber  offset  cai  boost  stroke  rigidity,btohqsg
Bumper  badge  these are not builds to me,btohqsg
So for all i care someone can take a proton and turn the outside into a 911 (has been done before)  i say wag u good,btohqsg
I think this is where you and I really different ba,btohqsg
and i can respect your opinion,btohqsg
I just hate the idea of someone pretending to be something you're not,btohqsg
