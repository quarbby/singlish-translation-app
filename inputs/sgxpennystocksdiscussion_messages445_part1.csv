Need to find stock with low floating shares,btohqsg
Duno why i still use fsm. Cant stop loss. Cant short. 😑,btohqsg
Let’s call a spade a spade,btohqsg
i dont use FSM as my primary. I mostly trade on iOCBC and POEMS. I use FSM sometimes as an alternative for sell orders that i'm not queueing for cheaper comm.,btohqsg
Tiger and Poems both cheap ah,btohqsg
all WFH - that's  why FSM crash :),btohqsg
I see... Sian sia. Smart nation all but need wait almost 1 wk for money to credit in,btohqsg
I considered. But FSM sell from CDP even longer than Dbs settlement,btohqsg
I rather pay the $10 ish extra in commission to get my money in earlier,btohqsg
unless u in need of proceeds to pick up others,btohqsg
then do at same brokerage to do offset easier,btohqsg
If you link your bank account to FSM account  it's actually quite fast. I get the cash proceeds ready for withdrawal by 5pm on T+2.,btohqsg
Good to have money on hand earlier to catch any opps,btohqsg
Yup actually if withdraw from the FSM cash acc to bank acc via FAST  is less than 30 mins according to their website. But its cos I selling from CDP  the crediting of $$ into my FSM cash account takes ages,btohqsg
This one like a bit no power these 2 days. Cut? Or hold?,btohqsg
No leh. My sell orders through FSM are all from CDP,btohqsg
I saw their website can take up to T+10? Not sure if I saw correctly,btohqsg
Last time I sold Unusual it took ard T+3. DBS T+2 iirc,btohqsg
Nope. I asked their CS before and so far  i always get it on T+2. It's ready for me to withdraw all by T+2 5pm.,btohqsg
I alr sold using Vickers liao  but thanks for the info.,btohqsg
