aiyo admin time to sleep alr ba  you have worked hard today :),btohqsg
mazda 6 has wagon. styulish and van fit your two dogs well. give it a thought,btohqsg
you warned a few guys today using your power?,btohqsg
haha i would love to have it too! mazda is honestly one of my favourite brands too. But the Mazda 6 is not tall enough thats why CX8 was the consideration.,btohqsg
i am about to stir the already heated chamber,btohqsg
but CX8 vs XC40  i'd prefer to stick to my scandinavian bloodüòãüòã,btohqsg
now is which EV can fit,btohqsg
I like CX8 haha rented one in japan,btohqsg
wow did admin lift me out of slow mode?,btohqsg
you guys been to germany motorshows like essen show?,btohqsg
lots of stuff to see for mods,btohqsg
You sleep?! Aren‚Äôt you a chatbot!?,btohqsg
of course frankfurt. biggest. but new cars only,btohqsg
i have been to geneva show too.,btohqsg
That one I‚Äôve been to their watch shows,btohqsg
frasnkfurt show i cant even finish. too big,btohqsg
Sadly the era of motor shows is slowly going away,btohqsg
More and more car makers are spending the money that they would spend on motor show stands to rent studios and invite influencers and media outlets to make content on cars and host lavish media drives or lend cars to the same content creators,btohqsg
Where are you going on Monday afternoon?,btohqsg
i went to sleep. heat is unbearable,btohqsg
after watching heated debate here. i dont want to feel hot anymore,btohqsg
tesla is going to build cars using special machines that make casting. i wonder if others would follow,btohqsg
Spend same amount  make an anime and have 1000x the exposure on youtube,btohqsg
Exactly  and you can present the car in various use cases,btohqsg
Some are moving away from the set media drives to studio shoots for launches and then lending the cars to content creators to drive and be creative in their own spaces to avoid the monotonous nature of set routes and locations,btohqsg
As the world evolves  carmakers are evolving and embracing the importance of the internet and social media,btohqsg
i believe i can fly. nice looking car,btohqsg
And also what you think of the XC40 recharge,btohqsg
This one I not sure leh  I didn‚Äôt reserdch too much into the model codes,btohqsg
Actually not alot of issues la but u have to know both are on different platforms. XC40 runs on a CMA platform which is meant to be a compact car while XC60 runs on a larger SPA platform which makes the car abit more luxurious. Both dont have any issues that i know of except maybe the aircon cooling coil which may (30% chance) of spoil. Other than that its a volvo.,btohqsg
Normal things like sensor maybe if reaching 10 year period need to change but i would count all this as wear and tear ba,btohqsg
XC40 T4 R was 180k back in april 2021  i heard they selling the XC40 recharge for upwards of 250k nowüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
It has to be because of Wearnes diverting all the EEAI and VES to subsidise the ICE cars.,btohqsg
Damn smart but also at the same time quite f up also.,btohqsg
thats whydont buy  let them realise that nobody wants to pay for itüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why that article by SGCM about D2C resonates very strongly with me personally,btohqsg
No dealers = no such BS,btohqsg
Aft I found that out I was like wth. If Wearnes can do this  so will other dealers.,btohqsg
their XC90 markup is very close to 100k  but at one point when they were trying to clear the previous gen S60  that was when i bought it because they lose abit of money on every car they sold,btohqsg
Like a sucker punch to them,btohqsg
But ya the data from OneMotoring that is refreshed every month also shows the difference between basic cost and actual alr.,btohqsg
exactly haha  now tht the XC40 recharge so expensive  used car prices for the ICE XC40 also went upü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
so good to be rich. can keep changing toy,btohqsg
Think he may be testing various type of suspensions!!!,btohqsg
You mean the ride quality right hahahahahaah,btohqsg
I think it is mutual benefit üôà,btohqsg
But a lot of ppl love dealers services,btohqsg
They enjoy the ‚Äúhaggling‚Äù process maybe,btohqsg
But it can be repetitive and very tiring aft visiting many showrooms,btohqsg
Yes and enjoy the ad giving them discount,btohqsg
