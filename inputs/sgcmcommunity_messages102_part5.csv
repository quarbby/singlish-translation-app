Tasted so good but now I’m seeing the outcome le,btohqsg
I saw some article online about a man paying $25 for nasi padang in Bedok. I knew it couldn't be your store but I thought about you for a split second - J,btohqsg
Good food is worth paying for!,btohqsg

Experts here. Buying 2nd hand Car. 28k for Toyota Vios with 2yr 9mth versus 27k Chevrolet Cruze with 3 yes left. Which is a better car to get.,btohqsg
They mentioned it will be within a week and it’s aligned with LTA guidelines,btohqsg
So they transferred after how many weeks?… we should report such unethical dealers to LTA,btohqsg
cruze less reliable less fuel efficient,btohqsg
slightly more space and better looking only,btohqsg
True but i drove a cruze before. It wasnt that bad.,btohqsg
Vios is cheaper to repair  but if the Vios condition is like 💩 then don't bother,btohqsg
it’s not bad  but vios better hahahah,btohqsg
cos cruze is basically a korean car,btohqsg
wah if i were u it’s between kia and vios,btohqsg
I would go for Altis if have. The bigger space is really worth the extra money,btohqsg
but the mileage all so high hahaha,btohqsg
My friend recently bought a E90 from them.. they didnt provide warranty for some odd reason.. he didnt say much but... yeah,btohqsg
Vios is just reliable  but very underpowered,btohqsg
I drove the 2.0litre before  very fun car to drive,btohqsg
Ohh I saw it as vios,btohqsg
All this car very high mileage cus its a legit workhorse,btohqsg
As far as renewed 5 year COE goes  might as well get something a little more comfortable to drive. Won't cost much more also,btohqsg
My main qn wud be u using car for what,btohqsg
If send family members Pt a to Pt B vios can liao,btohqsg
If got family members on wheelcar consider forte,btohqsg
Vios. Cruze can be slightly problematic and maintenance is a bit harder as mechanics and parts not common,btohqsg
Then bo pian suck thumb buy “not chio” car brand name,btohqsg
Yes vios a lot of mechanics,btohqsg
Some people are still sleeping in kia/hyundai,btohqsg
Now much better than their japanese competitors,btohqsg
