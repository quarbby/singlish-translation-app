won't u feel less bumpy if the rim is bigger?,btohqsg
nope  larger rims = larger tyres = thinner tyre profile (section height) = harsher ride,btohqsg
stock 1.4 golf impossible to feel bumpy unless your absorbers spoil,btohqsg
i thought it would improve on something,btohqsg
not always true. larger aftermarket rims can be lighter than smaller stock rims...,btohqsg
Sorry I forgot to add. Not just weight. Wheels with wider widths  and/or larger diameters will increase rolling resistance meaans you need more power to move those wheels.,btohqsg
you are also moving a larger diameter  which means you do more work by putting in more effort,btohqsg
but looks > everything in my book,btohqsg
only bio  i may be good at it,btohqsg
At times stability if your original tyres are just very thin in terms of cross section,btohqsg
first car just don't do it please... you will regret it the moment you scrape a kerb,btohqsg
Free Mercedes AMG polished lip design lol,btohqsg
What car and rim size do you have?,btohqsg
Golf is more suitable for youngsters,btohqsg
i auntie ... better dun spoil the image,btohqsg
uh that's a bad stereotype lol... golf 1.4 is good choice for city driving  small nimble and easy to park,btohqsg
just don't buy those that obviously modded and wacked to falling apart kind,btohqsg
and the boot is surprisingly big for a hatchback also,btohqsg
but ya hard to find ones with good condition,btohqsg
listed stock only mod rims but engine molested until üò¨,btohqsg
but to be fair singaporeans should start learning how to ppi,btohqsg
"yalor... some people see see just anyhow buy i ask them ""not scared piang ah""",btohqsg
honestly ppi should be a compulsary thing la  seeing how singaporeans drive their cars is scary enough,btohqsg
Great car if it wasn't for the stereotype they carry now and the condition of most of them,btohqsg
engine can be ok great condition,btohqsg
I want stock with good condition how,btohqsg
but nobody really knows then the dsg gna piang,btohqsg

Here's the issue  if everyone PPI then dealers also gonna start learning how to cheat the system or partnering with common workshops,btohqsg
cheat system cheat customer just to earn a extra buck and make others life harder,btohqsg
you ËµöÈí± (make money) so much only to unkowingly get cheated,btohqsg
Technically is not cheating  it's just glazing over details that should not be glazed over,btohqsg
You say cheat later they sue you,btohqsg
sue then sue back until car lift drop lor,btohqsg
