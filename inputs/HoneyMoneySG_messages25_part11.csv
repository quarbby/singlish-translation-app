Hi  question on CPF investment account : CPF app says I don't have a CPF OA Investment account BUT on dbs vickers I linked my CPF account to my DBS vickers trading account.

OCBC Frank has 8% cashback on foreign currency spend. Is this better than amaze or revolut even after taking into account all transaction and conversion fees for small spends? Assuming hitting minimum spend is not an issue.,btohqsg
sub-limit of $25 for the FCY spend category  so you max out at $312.50 of FCY spend. Then you need to make up the remaining $800 min spend using the contactless & online category  but wait! that also has a sub-limit cap of $25  so again you max out at $312.50 of spending. so that's only $625 out of $800 spend  and you need to make up the remaining $175 of spend in a suboptimal manner (either in the generic cashback category which earns you 0.3% or continue earning 0% in either of these two categories),btohqsg
Any ideas for side hustle to earn additional income?,btohqsg
