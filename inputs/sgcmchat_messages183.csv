Hello  does anyone know why does Singapore have no Supra mk4? I did some research and did find some supras that existed back in the early 2000s but now it just seems to have disappeared. Would really like to know what happened to them,btohqsg
i think most of them got scraped,btohqsg
theres 1 in a workshop i saw before,btohqsg
but iam not sure where that is,btohqsg
I saw there was a post on tiktok i think  there was a heavily modded supra at sentosa cove  the carpark there,btohqsg
there used to be like 4-5 otr,btohqsg
this should be the last one,btohqsg
we had a few on the roads in early 2000s  but the last one got totaled and now we have ~10 mk4s but none are registered,btohqsg
they can technically still be driven on the roads with a test or trade plate,btohqsg
bt im nt sure about that ah,btohqsg
Lemme try to find it sir,btohqsg
Eh pai seh  it was a youtube link,btohqsg
its been there for a long time edi,btohqsg
I hope its still there  would love to just see it in person,btohqsg

bro is not making it over a single pebble,btohqsg

Opposite at the pan Pacific hotel got a Huracan I think,btohqsg

If you study really really hard  graduate  then work really really hard for years on end‚Ä¶.your boss will finally be able to buy his dream lambo,btohqsg
Reminds me of the boy marching at Yishun Main road in the rain,btohqsg
I always believe it is bestowed from family wealth. It is out of reach for middle income salary workers. I was over 30 years old before I can buy my own car. And it is not even black plate as the COE prize are ridiculous. COE price are peanuts for the affluent when their cars cost way more than COE.,btohqsg
The fact that even a aftermarket rim is illegal  and if van doesn't have foglight from factory also can't install foglight,btohqsg
one sg huracan u can buy like a sf90 is dubai,btohqsg
Daddy's or mommy's money for some people but there are people who work their way up and able to afford this type of luxury,btohqsg
I have a dying questions to know the answer from people's POV cuz there's many answersWould u rather spend your own money buying luxury with your efforts and people respecting youorspend parents money and presenting to people that's its your own,btohqsg
Both don't matter because you're buying it for people's opinions of you. Buy it because you want it  you like it,btohqsg
You don't have to tell anyone where the source of money is from,btohqsg
If your parents are rich  good for you. If you want to get it through your own efforts  good for you too,btohqsg
I mean if I buy a luxury car now people think I show off or do black business it's a standard mindset for most people first impression kinda,btohqsg
"You can't control what they think and shouldn't bother. But to answer... it depends on who those ""people"" are. Friends  work  business? If friends think that way about you  you need new friends. Work  only jealous people will think you show off coz they can't do the same. Business  they will likely be happy for you because entrepreneurs know doing business is not easy and the rewards are also accordingly great",btohqsg
For me sometimes I have this habit of comparing myself to other ppl,btohqsg
I'm trying to stop this habit also.,btohqsg
U got any tips on how I can stop?,btohqsg

Bro his plate costs more than my life,btohqsg
holy shit there‚Äôs a fucking TV,btohqsg
"that's like saying ""your pagani is just a merc""",btohqsg
Using a brands engine and the car looking like a van is diff,btohqsg
Like a pagani doesn‚Äôt look like anything made,btohqsg
calling the alphard/LM a van is abit of a stretch,btohqsg
you'd probably refer to a Hiace as a van,btohqsg
Private hire alphards faster than Lambo,btohqsg
