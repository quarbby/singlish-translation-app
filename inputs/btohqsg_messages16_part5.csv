If the ballot went thru  we‚Äôll still have to wait till 5 years MOP to sell of the flat correct? Haha,btohqsg
Cannot get bto until you finish your 5years mop,btohqsg
You can only apply for a BTOafterthe 5 year MOP,btohqsg
Hi  For the 1st appt  normally hdb will call?,btohqsg
Hello  wanna ask  for queue number  if it‚Äôs just one project  is it combined with 3rm and 4rm? Or does each have its own queue number,btohqsg
hello  wanna ask if add in my child as occupier when apply for bto will it increase the chance? And will it consider used my child 1st chance of getting bto?,btohqsg
In August 2023  HDB will offer about 5 200 to 6 200 units of BTO flats in towns/ estates such as Choa Chu Kang (2-room Flexi/ 3-/ 4-/ 5-room/ 3Gen)  Tengah (2-room Flexi/ 3-/ 4-/ 5-room)  Bukit Merah (2-room Flexi/ 3-/ 4-room)  Kallang Whampoa (2-room Flexi/ 3-/ 4-room)  and Queenstown (3-/ 4-room). This number is subject to review as more project details will be firmed up closer to the launch date. We will provide more details at the next BTO exercise.,btohqsg
Should be in August BTO when they start priority for family with children in the recent MND COS,btohqsg
hello. wanna ask. i have applied under the PPS scheme as my wife is currently pregnant. do i have to email them the supporting documents for pregnancy? or is it not necessary. pls advice  thanks!,btohqsg
No need. Is automatically one they will send u a letter,btohqsg
Hi  I would like to ask it need a HLE letter to book a HDB. If now I get the HLE letter with HDB loan  can I change to take bank loan when my house is ready soon? Or can I show them the bank loan approval advise  but change to take HDB loan later on,btohqsg
Hi  I would like to ask:If my fiance signed on  does that mean he completed his NS? (Because they asked about it during the application),btohqsg
Can change to bank loan in the future. Get HLE first as it allows the flexibility to change. Once you pick bank loan  cannot go back to HDB loan,btohqsg
So can just put as yes?,btohqsg
hello  want to ask  when is the stamp duty and otp fee to be paid? And are they paid at the same time? And can we use cpf/ehg for that?,btohqsg
You asking for BTO or SBF flats?,btohqsg
Option to purchase is paid during the first appointment (flat selection) via NETS.Second appointment (6-9 months after your first appointment) you pay: downpayment of flat (5% if under staggered downpayment scheme  10% if not under the scheme)  buyer stamp duty fees and HDB conveyancing fees.Your EHG will be disbursed before your second appointment and goes into paying your downpayment for your second appointment. For these payments during the second appointment  you can use full CPF.,btohqsg
Do you also know if the balloting numbers are grouped by project or by room-type?,btohqsg
Don't know. Only HDB know üòÅ,btohqsg
First-timers must select BTO flats when invited by HDB or lose priority for a year from August launchhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/first-timers-must-select-bto-flats-when-invited-by-hdb-or-lose-priority-for-a-year-from-august-launch,btohqsg
THOSE who turn down theirfirst chanceto choose a flat in the HDB‚Äôs Built-To-Order (BTO) exerciseswill be bumped downthe BTO queue  in a rule tightening designed to shorten the long lines for new public housing flats.In the past three years  about 40 per cent of applicants who have been invited to book a BTO flat failed to do so ‚Äì either by declining the offer or missing their flat selection appointment. This amounts to around 10 000 applicants per year.Currently  those who decline to book a flat are issued a non-selection count and are given up to two non-selections before they are bumped down the line.,btohqsg
For second appointment  does viewing of payslips still required before they disbursed EHG?,btohqsg
Can I ask if I‚Äôm a full time uni student but I‚Äôm working part time  and my bf is in army. Does it means we will not be able to apply any grants as we will both be considered as unemployed(?) because I remember need to access the income level in order to get the enhanced housing grants etc,btohqsg
yes no grants available. u will be under the deferred income scheme  where hdb will assess your income again 3 (?) months before key collection  only then u can get your grants approvedmeans u have to pay the full 5% downpayment without grants (if you‚Äôre under staggered downpayment scheme thing),btohqsg
yes can  but u must be working for at least 12 months prior to application,btohqsg
i not so old not yet mdm üò≠,btohqsg
So even if I‚Äôm a student but part time  I still should apply under student?,btohqsg
yes  part time work/intern not counted as income assessment,btohqsg
Then actually when there‚Äôs no income=no grant  is harder for Uni/army ppl to apply even if we want toüòÖüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
isnt the downpay 20%  and split 10 10%?,btohqsg
the ehg is determined on the first appt yea?,btohqsg
yea it‚Äôs quite a pain in the ass  i‚Äôm a ft student but also working and they also didn‚Äôt want to assess my income,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why govt introduced the staggered downpayment scheme and deferred income scheme for those not working full time,btohqsg
Yes but which means during the downpayment part  is quite difficult,btohqsg
ESP if still need to pay the other misc,btohqsg
yeaa  so just have to fork out yourself  or ask parents for money  or get a loan to cover that hahaha,btohqsg
I think for staggered is 5% then 15%,btohqsg
yea this is the original default one  if you‚Äôre under 30 years old u can opt for the staggered downpayment scheme (5% at first downpayment  15% at key collection),btohqsg
ohhh i thought will split evenly. okok thanks for the info!!,btohqsg
Anyone planning to get the serangoon one?,btohqsg
Wah means no grant  cpf no money  need fork out cold hard cash as a student,btohqsg
if applying for plh  650k unit  5% is 32k ish  split 2 ppl is 16k each + stamp duties legal fees wtv WITHOUT GRANT,btohqsg
Okay la but can use cpf so nt entirely gone case,btohqsg
Prob need to go outside take loan,btohqsg
Can determine the proportion? Like say 80% use the guy cpf  20% use the girl,btohqsg
But if let‚Äôs say we take loan from bank to pay downpayment  does it affect us signing for housing loan? Just curious,btohqsg
I mean if that‚Äôs the worse case scenario la,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt want to take money from parents,btohqsg
bto for students is expensive üò¢,btohqsg
