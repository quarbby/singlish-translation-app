Ya. Will be thinking as now is falling interest rate. Wanna fixed a mid term type of investment,btohqsg
hello  anyone here knows how to set up eGIRO? I'm trying to pay my StanChart credit card bill with HSBC account,btohqsg
Lol good luck.. still need to use snail mail,btohqsg
eGIRO is ridiculous.. i believe it is still a unicorn (MYTHICAL CREATURE) even though it was launched many years ago. I don't even know who REALLY USES IT.,btohqsg
Can't remember if SC gives the business reply envelope  I know citi doesn't cuz just filled that one out  had to pay for postage + find a envelope,btohqsg
Ya lor...  maybe it's time to get a boc card... lolz,btohqsg
whoa okay many thanks for the info! was wondering why I couldn't find any info online regarding setting up eGIRO lol,btohqsg
I spent 9600+ or 9700+ also declined to waive.. but that was many many years back. So I stopped using OCBC card for quite a few years. Then last year my waiver got approved although I didn't spend a lot  but it was on Frank card.,btohqsg
Yup ocbc is ok if they waived otherwise just go to another bank,btohqsg
Which bank ask you to pledge?,btohqsg
Hi  may I know which is the best cashback cc now? Expenses mainly on groceries  dining n some random expenses  etc. Max $500  usually around $300. I hv uob one card alr  so this cashback cc will be used after I utilise the req amt of $500 fm uob. Thank you.,btohqsg
Citi giro form require you to write attn to different unit. So not sure if is BRE Is applicable.,btohqsg
Hello... wondering if someone has sold the investments in SNACK app?,btohqsg
I think long ago requirement is 12k so 9.7k is still far fetched.. now requirement is 10k I think 9.5k might still be acceptable.,btohqsg
That's true ü•≤ maybe can check Citi ibanking if there's eGIRO option. Based on their announcement  should have since 2022 Apr.,btohqsg
No. My time was also 10K. I called into OCBC. The CSO told me 10k and my spending for previous year was 9600+ or 9700+ so can't waive. I asked him only 200+ difference also can't waive? He said yes  cannot waive...üòì,btohqsg
You can try to go SCB ibanking site and login there and try register for egiro.. then select HSBC under bank.,btohqsg
Damn that's a sad sad promo,btohqsg
Hello! Any idea where in SCB ibanking it can be found? I‚Äôve looked everywhere in the webpage but could only find the manual GIRO form,btohqsg
Can't help you with that.. but based on the eGIRO guides  they all put similar steps:1. Go to merchant/billing organisation eGIRO registration page2. Select bank for GIRO arrangement3. Authenticate to bank4. GIRO process and ready,btohqsg
So maybe they support paying out from their bank but not paying into their cards.. so you're left with snail mailing or direct in branch.,btohqsg
Apart from G  looks pretty easy to achieve,btohqsg

Can I ask UOB KrisFlyer credit card for online shopping  do I entitled 3mpd on Lazada/Shopee if I purchase pet food online?Do they only award the bonuses based on certain mcc codes like UOb Lady‚Äôs fashion category? or it doesn‚Äôt matter for KrisFlyer CC üôèüèª,btohqsg
Yes  based on certain MCC codes. Shopee Lazada should qualify for 3mpd,btohqsg
This is UOB KF CC MCC for online shopping,btohqsg
Thanks   I don‚Äôt see pet food category.. I‚Äôm wondering if I can use KrisFlyer CC to purchase my cats‚Äô food and litter as I normally do it via Lazada/Shopee . Hence I signed up for UOB Lady and chose Fashion but it‚Äôs not entitled due to the different MCC codes which was told by the community not advisable to use la.. lol now I‚Äôm wondering if I can use KrisFlyer CC instead since it‚Äôs also for online shopping.. I need to hit $500 spending for the UOB One Acc but kinda confused with different tnc on these UOB cc ü§î,btohqsg
OH THEY HAVE AN APP NOW?!,btohqsg
When u buy from shopee/lazada  they MCC is 5311  regardless what u buy there or which ‚Äúshop/store‚Äù u buy from. The merchant will be shopee/lazada,btohqsg
"1. UOB KrisFlyer Card does not add-on to UOB One account ""Min spend requirement""2. You can consider using Amaze  with UOB Krisflyer  siam UOB$ merchant and see MCC code",btohqsg
Assuming u will have spent $800 in SIA-related group puchases ya... else no 3mpd,btohqsg
Do you have SC jumpstart MCC  where do we find this infos,btohqsg
