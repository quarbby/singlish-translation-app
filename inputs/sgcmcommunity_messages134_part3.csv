Actually there should just be cameras 🎥 at all the strategic points…. Since the Malaysians build their side with ambiguous lanes….. that pple just cut all the way to the front and can still merge with traffic… otherwise just station one ☝️ enforcement offer at various points… catch one  fine rm300….. surely that’s cost efficient and is a good deterrence,btohqsg
I mean who wants to wait?,btohqsg
A lot of the fines on sg side also is …. 50/50….. like I have heard pple said… esp for the bigger cars  go in near empty…. If u can Run x times  ur savings more than the fine Liao,btohqsg

Hi guys  I am in a dilemma now and would like to seek some advice from all of you.I have just purchased a 2016 1.2t qashqai J11.2 days into delivery  my car had a lot of white smoke being emitted from its exhaust and we stopped the car. My initial suspect was a blown gasket head. However after towing it back to my dealer’s workshop  I was informed that it was a blown turbo. Now I am informed that turbo is not covered under “engine & gearbox warranty” and was given a quotation of 4.5k+ to get a new turbo  inlet/outlet pipes etc.I’m not super sure of the market rate but was told by some of my workshop that the price is sky high. Could anyone please advise? Am thinking of taking this up to CASE.,btohqsg
I am not super sure so would like to seek the expertise of everyone here to advise me. Currently his written “warranty” doesn’t include the turbo charger,btohqsg
Lemon law does not cover if it’s a consignment unit,btohqsg
It’s not a consignment unit  got it from a dealership.,btohqsg
It could be at any point of time. Don’t quote me just saying,btohqsg
Thanks in advance for all your helpful inputs.,btohqsg
White smoke could be turbo or head gasket.,btohqsg
As per what I was informed  it’s not a head gasket issue/engine block crack.,btohqsg
Didnt u do PPI or STA evaluation prior?,btohqsg
Smells like lemon...I would go case especially since the dealer is betting that you won't.,btohqsg
Confirm its not consignment car? Cus some dealers they dont tell u its consignment car,btohqsg
Brought it to a workshop for evaluation  however there were no major issues raised.,btohqsg
Dont give us the dealer full name just XX where appropriate,btohqsg
I prefer to know  so I can avoid,btohqsg
Currently I’m waiting for my dealer to get back to me on how we’re going to settle this.,btohqsg
If he isn’t willing to help  then I’ll bring this up to CASE,btohqsg
And sgcarmart admin should take note,btohqsg
And preferably share it with all of you,btohqsg
It’s located in CARROS  famous place anyway haha,btohqsg
Not on U to prove that its broken,btohqsg
Give him a deadline  preferably a week  if they not going to take back the car or offer compensation  then go case. Unscrupulous ones will give all sorts of reasons to drag.,btohqsg
Onus of repair falls unto them,btohqsg
But wa ur workshop also dk turbo got problem? When test drive got leak air sound anot,btohqsg
Dealer sure drag citing all sorts of reasons,btohqsg
now dealers are not upfront about consignment cars. Do you have the contract in black and white that it is not consignment car?,btohqsg
No abnormal sound/compression issue from engine/turbo,btohqsg
It just blew on the 2nd day of driving,btohqsg
I’ll let you all know if my dealer is unwilling to give me any compensation.,btohqsg
Vehicle downtime 4 days I haven’t said anything too..,btohqsg
possible to go lower to 1.88?,btohqsg
seldom see qashqai turbo got problem tho,btohqsg
True that. But the turbo piping is broken.,btohqsg
the prev owner pia the card too hard alr lah,btohqsg
fellow driving 1.2 must be thinking he 1.6 turbo,btohqsg
Those with turbo   the car must let go after the 4th yrs,btohqsg
That what my SA told me,btohqsg
Hmm.. but I think it also depends on how the car was cared for.,btohqsg
Or at least that’s how I think.,btohqsg
Still within the warrenty and can fetch decent pricce when selling,btohqsg
I think whether turbocharged or NA engine  if care is poor  either way problems will surface.,btohqsg
my intake manifold broke aft i took over the car,btohqsg
Be careful guys  LTA now engaged special force to catch speeding drivers..,btohqsg
Wah.. That quite.. impressive to break sia,btohqsg
Impressive huh. Makes me wonder some times haha.,btohqsg
Yes it looks to be. Don’t think the outlet hose looks like this but please correct me if I’m wrong.,btohqsg
