Aiya just hope vaccine swee swee no daiji la,btohqsg
But in the world we living in,btohqsg
Now ask you take vaccine you also scared,btohqsg
Must wait for people take first,btohqsg
If people die or got side effects from vaccine then won't take le,btohqsg
Maybe reverse happen...vaccine come out  demand for PPE and gloves maintain or go back to level closer to pre covid level cause normality slowly  resumes  MT go back to its 1-2 cents ?,btohqsg
Problem is  u dun even know vaccine last how long. If only 1 year  then when can take finish for the whole world.,btohqsg
Haha as the famous quote goes - There are many things that must be done  but nothing must be done for the first time. Sir Humphrey Appleby,btohqsg
Problem is you think they won't continue studying meh,btohqsg
Your 1 to 2 cents very kua zhang leh.,btohqsg
A vaccine that is so rushed sure got its purpose one,btohqsg
SG after Sars start stockpiling. Now the whole world kenna one times 9696  I'm sure they will stock up on PPE and gloves,btohqsg
Just like how singapore ask us not to wear mask in the beginning,btohqsg
Unfortunately  the questions of duration and immunity do take time to uncover ” said Philip Dormitzer  viral vaccine R&D chief for Pfizer Inc.  which is developing a vaccine candidate with partner BioNTech SE.,btohqsg
Don't believe there won't be sustained demand for PPE and gloves. Just won't see supernormal profits lor,btohqsg
I just say only. I hope our normal lives can resume. Hope vaccine last forever and everyone bodaiji,btohqsg
Actually nothing to talk aboutIf medical counters price  and vaccine can co exist then good loh,btohqsg
This one... Must hope ang moh countries co-operate lor,btohqsg
But funny thing is everything a vaccine news drop I see medical counters tio whacked,btohqsg
They freedom freedom everyday until millions of cases,btohqsg
Think i read some report a few months back  they building up capacity to produce own PPE and gloves so next crisis wont be dependant on other people..similarly to producing food....,btohqsg
strategy change since stockpiling didnt work so well this round,btohqsg
Med will continue tanking until vaccine error news. As in like even with vaccine it does not stop the transmission and cases keeps increasing showing no signs of slowing down. Den the only way is the wear mask all the time / no gathering n etc measures until covid is gone.,btohqsg
Last time people also thinking how can we fly (before aeroplane is made),btohqsg
Ok all follow gem short MT and medicals tmr huat,btohqsg
Yeah it's good that we're being more self reliant. But ultimately impossible for SG to achieve 100 per cent self sufficiency... Unfortunately,btohqsg
Since when I want to short?,btohqsg
I waiting for the devil advocate only,btohqsg
Even if something is developed and can stop covid transmission  ppe/mask/glove demand will still be there for at least 1-2yrs. Assuming all countries get vaccinated by end of 2021.,btohqsg
I rather med don't go up if this is the only way.,btohqsg
But whether the demand and good forward looking business for ppe/glove/mask  it still depends on market sentiments n BB.,btohqsg
Any indication when Q4 results will release for MT?,btohqsg
If MT there’s any run  Dyodd to exit / TP.Don’t need hope for $1.6 1.8 2 anymore.,btohqsg
Yes. Learnt from last time liao.,btohqsg
Bb also not stupid to let us run so easily with profits la haha,btohqsg
As long not greedy n set a tp n stick to it,btohqsg
medtec weeklong term ew wabc upwb dn 61.8 770px hit low 760if this support wc up 2725this is around 24 Janby then u will know it is awabc up or ew up,btohqsg

What do you guys think about the SIA stock tmr? Since phase 3 coming?,btohqsg
Tml generally for sg company should be green,btohqsg
Dun think pm announcement really help business activity.,btohqsg
Honestly I don't fancy. Phase 3 != overseas travel. The cargo division also not say can earn tons from vaccine delivery,btohqsg
But of course market is irrational sometimes...,btohqsg
