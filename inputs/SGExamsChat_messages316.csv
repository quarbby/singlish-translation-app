U need almost perfect gpa to go nus/ntu,btohqsg
But jc u can be an avg student,btohqsg

Obviously he would be referring to average jc student in the entire sg,btohqsg
Who so mico compare in sch,btohqsg

Personally id rather retake... diploma is 3 years,btohqsg
U didn‚Äôt say stop at a levels,btohqsg
U can be tutor while awaiting for uni,btohqsg
But if ur results shit  who want to hire haha,btohqsg
Honestly has anyone got into the course they want although their COP is 2 points away for os,btohqsg
i only know this context as of 9.06pm,btohqsg
I think its possible. Abysmally low chance thou,btohqsg
Can go common engineering then go mechanical,btohqsg
Imagine getting expelled from sinagpore because I suck must go overseas uni ü•≤,btohqsg
How to expel from a country?,btohqsg
Oh i thot u meant deported lol,btohqsg
Dun wan say hi to u,btohqsg
Is it just me there is alot of scam call these days,btohqsg
I get one from recruiter calling me at 7.30pm from one of the top xx management firm lol so believable,btohqsg
I'm chilling on a Friday night,btohqsg
Sheesh.. mine coming like next week,btohqsg
Imagine someone conducted the ocbc scam  pretends to be one of the victims that lost the largest amount of money and gets reimbursed,btohqsg
In the end its how every individual sees itüòÅ although i would agree its more of an unpopular route la,btohqsg
I got alot alot alot friends as a private candidate,btohqsg
Tbh i have no idea how many priv candidates there were until i entered the exam venue(classroom),btohqsg
Shocking tbh  people of different ages,btohqsg
during my time it was at moe lc,btohqsg
I had one uncle taking papers w me,btohqsg
Manz I miss studying w him,btohqsg
Because everything happens for a reason,btohqsg
keep urself close to the shelf,btohqsg
centre of gravity and all that shi yk,btohqsg
Like damn am i glad that they dont restrict the number of times for retaking. Its an eye opening experience when all along when studying in sch  we've been surrounded by people of similar age constantly pressurized by the system/sch/wtv.or maybe its just me la üòÖüòÇ,btohqsg
That light at the end of the tunnel,btohqsg
But aint it principle of moments instead,btohqsg
haha well good n bad tbvh,btohqsg
Not completely i had tuition for some subjects while some is just random last min/abrupt  tuition/reddit/tele,btohqsg
But they are merging with chem eng and bioeng into cceb,btohqsg
yea well if cg is out of base then generates moment lor,btohqsg
Me and my friend retook el last year,btohqsg
He literally left paper 2 compre blank (did summary and visual text and the first few questions),btohqsg
He didn't feel confident for paper 1,btohqsg
And yet he ended up with a c6,btohqsg
A grade up he got in 2021,btohqsg
Hahahahah I asking for a friend ah,btohqsg
Uh those planning to retake eng next year hor the  eng oral format  will change from reading aloud to viewing vid and creating a speech but i think youre given a choice whether to take new/old syllabus,btohqsg
Cuz they took Os eng 3 times and same results,btohqsg
Is tat for sku candidate or private candidate,btohqsg
If private I wanna try this year hehehehe,btohqsg
Since its new format maybe there will be a choice to choose for ppl retaking? Idk need to double check haha,btohqsg
Maybe can choose btw new and old syllabus,btohqsg
I retook eng too improved from c6 to b4,btohqsg
Since u taking PC r u gonna retake every sub for jc-?,btohqsg
I just focused mainly on the essay type that i wanna write (literally keep writing personal recount),btohqsg
I remembered me and my friend walked out saying we wanna get A* because the previous year we got A1,btohqsg
My bad im on low bat,btohqsg
Weren't u the one that say u re-taking Os to go jc,btohqsg
I was scared asf cuz my actual grade is D7,btohqsg
Butbut eng helps in L1 tho owo,btohqsg
Yepp but i think ok alr lol besides oral format changed and i aint risking it,btohqsg
that is with effect from 2023 onwards. those retaking in 2022 will still have reading aloud  same goes for 5NA in 2023.,btohqsg
reading aloud will be a component for oral in 2022 and 2023 papers (for 5NA and those who retained in 2022).,btohqsg
Okay thank you so much let me update,btohqsg
2023 English oral just looks cursed,btohqsg
I think MOE is standardising the MT and EL Oral,btohqsg
Hello! May i know if anyone here is a O lvl private candidate this year?,btohqsg
orhhh hahahah cuz i wanted to create a groupchat just for PC so that it would be easier to share resources and have someone to talk who share the same experience.,btohqsg

Hello  one of my cousins got l1r5 of 16 nett for her o levels. She wants to go TMJC. Can she make it? Idk why she ask me so late.,btohqsg
what was the l1r5 requirement for tmjc,btohqsg
when i applied for my jc two years back  friends who got the same nett score of 6 as me for nyjc who applied for science stream (6points) didnt get in. i got into arts stream (7points). so like JCs prioritise the raw l1r5 first before the nett scores.,btohqsg
if shes nett 16 then shes competing with people who got raw 13,btohqsg
to get a place. which is unlikely for JC JAEs,btohqsg
if she rlly wants to get into TMJC is still very possible,btohqsg
after the results of the JAE are released  there will most definitely be students who got a position in TMJC to withdraw from that JC for another institution of their choice (note that other students may also not have gotten their ideal choice),btohqsg
your cousin will then be able to appeal for TMJC during the orientation period of JC.,btohqsg
she will have to go to her designated JC‚Äôs general office to apply for an appeal to another institution of her choice.,btohqsg
depending on the JC (may be all  I‚Äôm not absolutely clear) there may be an interview to determine if appeals will be approved.,btohqsg
when I enrolled into nyjc i considered appealing for another JC also even though i got my first choice (cos nyjc removed ELL from its subjects list without updating that year‚Äôs JAE booklet),btohqsg
and I also have friends who appealed to other JCs. so is very possible to appeal still.,btohqsg
Appeal will require ur cousin to provide reasons as to why tmjc should accept the appeal,btohqsg
Though being possible  its not easy as well  especially if the l1r5 didnt meet the COP,btohqsg
does anyone know whether chemical engineering at sp or np is better??,btohqsg
Woah so rich ah USD sia HAHAHA,btohqsg
I wanna send the same sentence also ah HAHAHA,btohqsg
Ask her if she want to see your dick.,btohqsg
If she say yes. Then ask her to let you see her boobs first then i will show you mine. HAHAHA,btohqsg
Omg she just blue tick onii,btohqsg
We are the horny cunt to them,btohqsg
Now I'm texting her using my other phone number üòÇüòÇ just wanna have fun HAHAHA,btohqsg
@fez_tivalu got receive msg from her.,btohqsg
@toklo7896say he tot is a girl sia.,btohqsg
Btw@toklo7896cannot chat here. He kena reported,btohqsg
Bruh did you reply the scammer using your other account,btohqsg
Yeah then they can report you and restrict your account,btohqsg
You can appeal via spam info bot and just say the other part is a scammer,btohqsg
Telegram is good in the sense that there are real people behind the bot and they're quite efficient,btohqsg
But they said they can't do anything,btohqsg
Luckily this account now cam send messages,btohqsg
In case anyone want start mugging,btohqsg
Anyone has recommendations for Lower Sec Assessment books,btohqsg
They start selling since 1st jan btw.,btohqsg
Usually 1st jan they will start selling TYS,btohqsg
This is true  can cfm  bcos I‚Äôm working there üëçüèªrecently seems like quite a number of people buyingBtw Marshall cavendish assessment books now all 20% off,btohqsg
Pay not good but I no need to urgently get money so just work for a while,btohqsg
Hope j2 days are well so far?,btohqsg
yo what should i expect in j1? like when i first enter the school for orientation?,btohqsg
Yah that‚Äôs mainly what I use the iPad for xd,btohqsg
Bcos don‚Äôt want to keep printing papers,btohqsg
Maybe for notes you might want to do on actual paper,btohqsg
Like those other sch kind where they put online own time own target ones,btohqsg
Esp mcq I don‚Äôt want print so just do on ipad  circle the option,btohqsg
Heard it‚Äôs terrible drinking coffee when lack of sleep,btohqsg
Next day also cannot remb wtv you studied cos sleep too little haha,btohqsg
Mm I think diff people have diff period of sleeping time that is best for them,btohqsg
Can experiment w it  but just try not to go below 7h,btohqsg
Make some hot milk or smth,btohqsg
I have a fish sticker for that,btohqsg
This fish has gotten more depressing,btohqsg
I would think it‚Äôs a good investment  plan to use mine for a long time,btohqsg
But whether or not to get it now you can choose  not necessary to use ipad in jc,btohqsg
Because want to do ART and send on 12am Monday in case forget,btohqsg
Usually is a mid July to late sep promotion I think  can look out during this period,btohqsg
Nope part time work  most likely official guideline to do regular testing for employees in SG,btohqsg
Lel what to do if work agent didnt reply after 20+ mins,btohqsg
My friend ask me to ask this : Should he retake O level math? Becuz he has gotten d7 for his math and he is in his last year in poly and he wants to enter CHS in local uni.,btohqsg
I dunno how to advice cuz nvr go thro poly route,btohqsg
check whether there is any requirement for math at the relevant uni website,btohqsg
My company has weekly ART also  but they say they volunteered for it lol,btohqsg
some twice a week some once a week,btohqsg
At least for my own company,btohqsg
I work at f&b but I once a week only lol,btohqsg
ur company sponsor art test kits rite,btohqsg
Mine requires me to do ART at a QTC but it ‚Äòs paid by them.,btohqsg
Back then only for those who can wfh but need come back workplace. Those whose role cannot wfh no need ART  but the company decide to volunteer everyone for 8 weeks,btohqsg
basically any job where ur working in like a building or shop or room or warehouse or wtv must do art once a week,btohqsg

If i appeal to a different stream in my assigned jc and it‚Äôs unsuccessful  does my current posting become invalid?,btohqsg
Example i get into acjc sci and I appeal to switch to acjc arts (meet cop) but appeal isn‚Äôt successful  do I still have my initial posting to acjc sci?,btohqsg
You can call the sch to maybe double confirm but idt it can just become invalid after unsuccessful appeal,btohqsg
if thats the case idt anyone will dare to appeal lol,btohqsg
You‚Äôll have to choose your subject combi in the portal first  after the results of it are out you can appeal,btohqsg
I hope you kids got the allocation you preferred!,btohqsg
anyone watching Beijing Olympic opening ceremony?,btohqsg
Guys  I have something to ask you allWhoever is studying in RP yet has already gone for internshipWhat would happen if I forgot to ask my company supervisor for Company Stamp and I straightaway submit the workbook?,btohqsg
hey guys is it possible to appeal from arts to sci stream within the same school (acjc if knowing the sch helps)? what happens if there‚Äôs no more vacancies in the sci stream? will you kena stuck in the art stream and forced to take 2h2 arts subjects? asking for a friend thanks in advance,btohqsg
ofc she met the cop for the sci stream but she didn‚Äôt get in,btohqsg
What r the odds of appeal being successful for 12raw 8nett ( affiliation + cca ) for a sch with a COP of 8 for science stream?,btohqsg
For Acjc you‚Äôll be forced to enter an arts stream combi inside (you‚Äôll have to put in 2H2 arts) the portal first. When they give out the subject combi allocation you do not sign the paper to say you accept the subject combi  and there would be an area set up where you can go to to appeal to change your subject combi. That‚Äôs where she can appeal to switch to the science stream,btohqsg
If there‚Äôs enough vacancies they should allow,btohqsg
What combi does she intend to take?,btohqsg
Hmm I see. Good luck with the appeal then. What was the raw tho?,btohqsg
I think if it‚Äôs like 10 it‚Äôs even more likely they‚Äôll accept the appeal,btohqsg
omg thank you so much for the detailed reply,btohqsg
I mean if this comforts your friend I heard of a case where a student only met the arts stream cut off  wanted to do hybrid with 2H2 science (which is considered a sci stream combi)  but she put inside the portal 2H2 arts with one H2 science and one H1 science  then during the appeal period she was able to change it to 2H2 sci and one H2 arts and one H1 arts,btohqsg
Although there‚Äôs no guarantees your friend can switch I think the chances should be quite high,btohqsg
Since she met the cut off,btohqsg
whattt  was her intended combi super unique?,btohqsg
But ofc if the person who only met the arts cut off wanted to switch to a full science combi with 3H2 sci I think it‚Äôs quite unlikely they‚Äôll allow,btohqsg
Not sure tho I only heard from a friend but basically she wanted to do 2H2 science with one H2 arts and the H1 being arts also. But if you enter via arts stream by right that‚Äôs not allowed,btohqsg
So if want to do 2H2 sci have to appeal,btohqsg
yeah okie i‚Äôll let my friend know to be safe and just appeal,btohqsg
But make sure she is clear that appeals are only done after the subject combi allocation results are out so in the meantime have to put an arts combi inside the portal first and hope for the best during the appeal afterwards,btohqsg
btw are you a j2/j3 in acjc this year or what,btohqsg
But I considering voluntarily retaining to change subject combi lol but they still haven‚Äôt tell me whether I can yet,btohqsg
are you switching stream as well? or just certain subjects,btohqsg
so that means there‚Äôs a chance you‚Äôll join our batch?,btohqsg
I think they‚Äôll only tell me if can retain next monday,btohqsg
You also got posted to Acjc?,btohqsg
but i got into sci stream already hehe,btohqsg
Is there a requirement/criteria to retain to change sub combi too?,btohqsg
I personally regretted joining Acjc but I hope yall have a good experience there,btohqsg
Have to not meet the promo criteria lor. If you want to retain but your results good enough to promote have to appeal,btohqsg
omg please let me know if you don‚Äôt mind sharing ü§≠ü§≠ i wanna mentally prepare myself for sch,btohqsg
It‚Äôs either promote advance or so bad it‚Äôs forced to retain,btohqsg
Discuss via pm if u rly want to ask about more,btohqsg
For advanced u can promote but have to sit for tests at the start of J1 I think,btohqsg
Or u can also choose to retain without appealing,btohqsg
Alright thank you so much for the info  hope you get your desired outcome üòÅ,btohqsg
My friend got 10 raw 8 nett,btohqsg
He went to np and paid 50 dollars for last minute revoking,btohqsg
That‚Äôs for from poly to jc,btohqsg
Appeals within the own jc to switch stream if you meet the COP will be higher ofc,btohqsg
As in he revoke eae last min,btohqsg
Ya but ur friend wasn‚Äôt appealing outside of Acjc to switch stream,btohqsg
And he didn't rly give much info during the interview,btohqsg
He kinda sad that he didn't get into ac,btohqsg
But he living his life in jp,btohqsg
Crushing everyone in his class lol,btohqsg
He got like 77.5 rp in y1,btohqsg
If he did stay on with NP he could have just JAE into AC the next batch,btohqsg
But if he got 10-2 might be rejected from science this year,btohqsg
He wasn't too happy because he compares jp standard to other jc standard,btohqsg
Like one of my friend got 75 rp in ac y1,btohqsg
He did well for his prelim during sec sch,btohqsg
One of the toughest course to get in via eae,btohqsg
He didn't want to waste any time,btohqsg
He isn't willing to pay 1.4k per sem,btohqsg
If ur friend had put Acjc sci last years confirm would have been accepted,btohqsg
Since there were ppl with 12-4 getting inside,btohqsg
This year even ppl with 10-2 are getting rejected,btohqsg
He couldn't even do his jae,btohqsg
So end up this year AC rejects quite a number of them going RV lol,btohqsg
So RV becomes the sch for AC rejects,btohqsg
By default once u get your eae your jae cannot do,btohqsg
Those which got 10-2 and put AC science first then RV sci second,btohqsg
You eae into poly you can jae into jc,btohqsg
Ur friend didn‚Äôt know that so that‚Äôs why didn‚Äôt try?,btohqsg
But cannot Jae into another poly course,btohqsg
The o level cert said sth like no jae or sth,btohqsg
Was told that for JC can still apply using Jae even if a spot has been reserved in a poly,btohqsg
Your friend should rly have logged inside the Jae system to check,btohqsg
Cos even if he thinks cannot no harm checking,btohqsg
