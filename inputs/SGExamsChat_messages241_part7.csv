like how do they award the marks,btohqsg
my cher say they award the marks based on how well u score for content  like the points u give,btohqsg
depends on what u wanna become,btohqsg
but sure if u want to go through a dip into law degree,btohqsg
even so its hard in itself,btohqsg
imo no sane lawyer wannabe would aim for a poly lol,btohqsg
law is one of the most hardest and competitive course to get in even with an almost full rp,btohqsg
talk about going with a dp,btohqsg
to put it bluntly u wouldnt even think of poly if uk u wanna do law,btohqsg
why do ppl go to jc than to poly,btohqsg
poly more hands on as compared to jc and most of my poly friends go to poly because they're sick and tired of the rigid style of schooling like uniform and proper hair everyth,btohqsg
if ur going towards something hands on like engineering then yes poly much better,btohqsg
but smth like law is more,btohqsg
theres rlly not much hands on skills u can learn for law honestly    writing papers? debating? those are skills jc ppl pick up probably more often than poly ppl,btohqsg
