Hello  does anyone use citi payall? And is it worth? To use it with a citi cash back+ card?,btohqsg
Understand there‚Äôs a small service fee  but is the cash back more than this fee?,btohqsg
I used it with Citi Premiermiles,btohqsg
2% fee vs Citi cashback+usually more worthwhile if there's ongoing promos,btohqsg
check Citi cashback+ cashback cap + tier requirementsthen work backwards,btohqsg
Ohh but 2% fee is more than the 1.6% the card gives üò±,btohqsg
Most of the time it's not worth it unless you are using 4mpd/5% cashback cards,btohqsg
Hi all  what do you think of Crypto Ruby (2%) cashback card vs UOB One lol!,btohqsg

but the most popular exchange available was mt gox that went bust later üòÇ,btohqsg
@boontee86are u the boon tee that just appeared on Kelvin channel?,btohqsg
The 2% is paid back in CRO but quite hassle free. Recently CRO price just went up  so for the same $500 stake you will have less CRO. There are still certain categories which are not entitled to the 2%.,btohqsg
@boontee86could u reccomended what is the least risky way for newbie to do options? Long Vs short? Put Vs call. What in the money out of the money. Naked Vs cash secured,btohqsg
Learn the basic first  watch the 3 hours video that@ChrisHMSGhas shared earlier and understand the technical side of things like the option payoff diagram  the greeks like delta  gamma,btohqsg
Not sure which brokerage offers paper trading on options  then can try out first,btohqsg
Bear in mind that options (except for the LEAPS)  is generally a short-term trading strategy e.g. you are either betting on the direction of the share price  or betting on the volatility. So if you have no idea on the direction to bet  then better don't touch options,btohqsg
@boontee86hmm but why would u do it on high vol stocks tho? I don't want those meme stocks. Like u said 1 major loss can wipe out all your past returns.And also  if you're very bullish on certain stocks to do put options  but can't afford to buy 100 of it  then how?,btohqsg
for stocks that are too stable like Apple  Facebook  the implied vol is very low. It is like you are selling insurance but you are only receiving little money,btohqsg
I wonder what's@ChrisHMSG's view on options? Do you do any options?,btohqsg
I only sell puts when I see the ER super good but the stock still fall like crap.Previously sold a $190 Call on ENPH and burnt  luckily closed before it went above $200,btohqsg
That said  I Sold two ENPH puts before selling the call to make sure I'm covered both sides,btohqsg
icic... so at worst called away  limit the upside üôèüèª,btohqsg

UOB One is a 5% cashback provided you can fulfill the onerous terms(1) 2K per month for 3 months(2) each month must have at least 5 transactionsif you have a big purchase that you can consistently split over time  then sure this makes a lot of sense,btohqsg
I useCrypto.comRuby 2% (now Indigo for 3%) only for transactions that would not earn me anything elsewherelike medical bills for example which is on the exclusion list for many,btohqsg
Example can be use BNPL services like Atome,btohqsg

960 BTO flats in Rochor have been launched for sale under HDB's new scheme for prime area property.A total of 4 501 BTO flats were launched across 6 estates  including Hougang and Kallang Whampoa.Details:https://cna.asia/3HwWuaa,btohqsg
I can never afford a bto cos they are 6 digits  probably need to work until 40/50+ years old. So rather not waste $ on a devaluating asset and invest instead,btohqsg
u don't pay the entire 6 digits upfront right?,btohqsg
if u put in 20 percent down payment on a 500k flat which is 100k and after 5 years let say if u can sell it and make a 100k profit nett of finance charges  legal fees and stamp duty etc. it would be a 100 percent return on your original investment.,btohqsg
"I think you have a huge misunderstanding of how property works. You may want to check my video on ""Property shooting to the moon""",btohqsg
Yup I know that.  But I'm not ok with being 500K in debt for decades eh,btohqsg
How come I see young couples mid 20s/30s can afford 5 room flat ah? Must be some crypto god's or bought Tesla in 2010 kind ? Or earn 10K a month?,btohqsg
got CPF OA to cover a portion of the monthly repayment ma.,btohqsg
But my CPF is for my retirement eh. Even if use cpfoa need to repay with interest isn't it. Not worth leh...,btohqsg
Well depends on how you look at it. at least for me property is a very good investment vehicle. just that if u want to run it at higher level  the capital outlay will get bigger and bigger. A BTO could be your first pot of gold to do it.There are always costs involved in everything we do be it time or money.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs your timeframe? Do you sell call or put weekly or bi weekly?,btohqsg
Only selling puts now 30-45d for max time decay.No fixed pattern  depends on mood,btohqsg
Any video for Hougang Olive or Tanjong Tree ?,btohqsg
Good morning üîÜI am new to using MooMoo  and have 2 qns .(1) when we make an initial deposit  do we use eg. DBS multi currency account? Do we select Sgd/usd in moomoo app?(2) if I would like to buy a US STOCK and want to deduct from the deposit account  does it mean the initial deposit should be in USD? Or the deposit currency doesn't matter?,btohqsg
SGDYou can deposit in SGD.Then convert SGD to USD in Moomoo app  then buy the US stock in USD,btohqsg
Also make sure you hit the min initial deposit to get your 1 FREE AAPL STOCK,btohqsg
And make sure you used my referral linkhttps://bit.ly/sgmoomoo,btohqsg
Can the free apple stock be transferred out without any minimum trades in moomoo?,btohqsg
# Please note that the allocated Apple Share will be issued automatically within 3 business days. User will need to maintain daily average assets of above SGD 2 700 / USD 2 000 / HKD 16 000 for 30 days from share allocation; only after can the allocated Apple Share be activated and traded. Inactivated shares after 30 days from share allocation will be remain inactive and will be removed from the respective FUTU SG Securities Account within 7 days.,btohqsg
In short  keep your $2700 Sgd inside for 30 days then your AAPL can be sold and cash out,btohqsg

Any kind soul able to answer my query on options? If I sell a put option and ON EXPIRY the stock price is above my strike price (which means a correct prediction for sell put)  do I still get assigned to buy 100 shares?In short  I sell a put option and on expiry my prediction is right  do I still get assigned to buy 100 shares?,btohqsg
Any kind souls care to tell me how to invest SnP500 on MOOMOO?,btohqsg
You sold a put and didn't hit strike price  it will expire worthless i.e. you don't have to buy a put to cover.But actually should let@boontee86answer,btohqsg
So I just search$SPYon MooMoo right?,btohqsg
What's the difference between Voo and SPY,btohqsg
But VOO has lower expense ratio of 0.03 Vs 0.09,btohqsg
So VOO is more cost efficient. üëç,btohqsg
Will you please explain that in layman term? What‚Äôs expense ratio? Haha! Thank you.,btohqsg
It means is a small cost u Habe to pay for holding the etf. Means if u Have 1000 in VOO u pay 0.3$. it is included in the price alr so u don't have to do anything,btohqsg
Woah! Learnt a lot from this group. GY  do you personally think snp 500 is a good time to go in now? Will still only get higher and higher lol,btohqsg
Buying index funds are actually a good way for beginners to begin investing üëç cos it has in built diverisification (top 500 US companies)  low cost.,btohqsg
In terms of timing it's rly hard to time the market so you could just hold the etf for the long term üëç so expect some slight fluctuations but it won't flucate as much as individual stocks,btohqsg
I sold a put option means I‚Äôm bullish. The stock price is above my strike price (means I predicted correctly). Expire worthless means I get to keep my premium and I don‚Äôt have the obligation to buy 100 shares right?,btohqsg
One of my favourite GIFs from@boontee86I PM you lol,btohqsg
You're right shifu. It will expire worthless üëçüèª,btohqsg
@boontee86Expire worthless means it's out of the money put option right ? If it's in the money then need to forced to buy 100 shares?,btohqsg
You already received the premiums when you sold the options. So the option position will appear in your portfolio as a negative amount. If it expire worthless means this negative amount will trending to 0 then eventually removed from your portfolio (usually during Saturday),btohqsg
Don't call me shifu lah  paiseh,btohqsg
Everyone is shifu  we all learning from one another,btohqsg
if it ends up in-the-money  at maturity  if you get assigned  they will give you the 100 shares of stock and deduct the strike price X 100 from your cash account. That is why typically you need to enable margin in order to sell put option. But all these are brokerage specific  so you might want to check with those who use the same brokerage as you. For example Tiger  they might force you close the position on Friday maybe like 30 minutes or 1 hour before market close. I can only confirm the situation for IBKR because I have not traded options with Tiger before.,btohqsg
I watch your youtube to learn from you  so you are my shifu üôèüèªü§ó,btohqsg
Ok luh  i also learn from your video on US stocks  also shifu vice versa,btohqsg
Anyway  HI to all new members who joined recently from the BTO videos. Don't worry too much if you don't understand all these investing/finance jargons. Step by step you will learn along. But if you have any questions on HDB  BTO  Property  can ask here too,btohqsg
Just don't PM me otherwise I very busy to answer all of you,btohqsg
Which means for all sell options  regardless if it‚Äôs in the money/out of the money  we may get assigned? But assignment is at random right?,btohqsg
I think the short answer to your question is  in the money = assign  out of money = no assign,btohqsg
To add on this  the right to exercise belong to the option holder (those who bought the option). So if you short PLTR put with strike at $21 strike price  then tonight the share price is traded at $21.01 near the market closing  the option holder may still exercise and you get assigned,btohqsg
A public holder of an option usually must declare their notice to exercise by 5:30 p.m. on Friday. This time-frame will allow the broker to notify the exchange of the holders' intent by the actual expiration time on Saturday.,btohqsg
Regular trading hours for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq Stock Market are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern,btohqsg
so between 4.00pm and 5.30pm  if the share price continue to trend down (in the after-hours)  it is likely that the option holder will exercise. And during this period you cannot close your option already because options can only be traded during regular trading hours,btohqsg
One more thing  the holder could exercise before the maturity e.g. Wednesday or Thursday. This is common in situation where the time value is very low e.g. option is already deep in-the-money,btohqsg
Thanks for the more info üëç,btohqsg
21.01 did not hit 21. Option holder can exercise?,btohqsg
Chris/admin  please delete if you find this irrelevant. So apparently  I came across this app on my IG and seems like everyone is on it. You get to earn $1 every hour apparently. I am trying it out and have earned $14 the past 14 hours lol.If you are keen  you may download the app and try it out. No capital needed for this! PM for referral code.App Download:https://onelink.to/b8xtguReferral Code: PM me for referral code,btohqsg
Please edit your message and remove the referral code or I will delete it. You can keep the message but ask people to pm you for referral instead,btohqsg
they can... even if the price is $22 they also can exercise. Just that we don't expect them to exercise because why would they exercise to sell at $21 when market is at $22? But there are such instances  but quite rare,btohqsg
Option holder is the one who sell the put?,btohqsg
Then why they want to sell at a lower price if market price is already higher,btohqsg
ya some are not educated ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ,btohqsg
if pltr trade at $22  you got assigned at $21  you actually get free money  assuming pltr open at $22 on Monday,btohqsg
I would avoid.(1) Looking at the website  there's no real crypto product(2) Whitepaper basically tells me there's no product.- it's a general introduction to Bitcoin  Blockchain and just a poor attempt at SEO marketing (all the buzzwords)(3) why do you need to KYC for DeFi?? it doesn't make sense,btohqsg
not saying won't be able to earn morning though.maybe you can cash out or have friends who have already done so.but this isn't really a crypto thing to me at all,btohqsg
free money means that you just bought at $21 and you can immediately sell at $22 on the market on Monday,btohqsg
if it doesn't take up your time  perhaps?but if it does  I rather spend the time reading up on something else or trying out a new DeFi protocol,btohqsg

Anyone interested to join Boon Tee's stock conference  you may do so at this link. Lots of good opinions there. It's tomorrow  Sunday morning,btohqsg
@boontee86whoa thanks for sharing and being transparent about your portfolio,btohqsg
I see that u got SE limited in there. Any thoughts whether it is a good time to buy it now at 310?,btohqsg
Thanks a lot@ChrisHMSGfor the sharing üôèüèª,btohqsg
SE is a growth stock  the valuation does seems high by traditional valuation metrics and still burning cash. This kind of companies we should expect high volatility. But if you believe their long-term strategy e.g. the global expansion and successful entrance into new lines of business (e.g. SeaMoney)  it could still be a good buy  even at current pricep/s: Edited the first line for better clarity,btohqsg
My portfolio reflects my conviction level  at 2% allocation I will say my conviction is not particularly high. I am still concerned with the cash burn and potential slower growth. All businesses face this risk it's just that if the valuation is high the crash would be more drastic if it happen.,btohqsg
By the way it is not a stock conference  we name it talk cock sing song because it is a casual weekend chat. It is a voice chat session  so if you have any questions or topic to talk about  can use the slido to let us know your questions. Actually this is the first time we are using slido  before this we just ask around see if anyone has questions or topic,btohqsg
Ya Gyüåàyou can ask the SE question in the slido and see what others think about it,btohqsg
Just checking the moneyowl srs promo  they allow multiple one time investments right? They will sum the amount invested via one-time investments as at end of Dec is it?,btohqsg
One-time top up only.Refer to tnc herehttps://www.moneyowl.com.sg/promotions/srs-promo/,btohqsg
But we can do multiple one-time top up right? What is excluded is the rsp right?,btohqsg
Once you top up the first time  they will take that amount to see which tier you qalualify for already,btohqsg
Thought we can split our top-up rather than just a first-time amount based on what they mentioned here,btohqsg
1.2% + 1.2% + 1.7% (UOB Absolute) = 4.1% Cashback on McDonald's.,btohqsg

That's it folks  I'm done with the BTO videos for Nov 2021.,btohqsg

I have got a question  hope someone can enlighten me. When ETF goes down/fall  where can I read up on the reason/cause to such cases?,btohqsg
ETF is a basket of stocks. For ex s&p500 etf SPY. if the individual components / mix of the etf drop  of course it will drop. Must it is less volaite compared to buying individual stock. Because if 1 company crashes within the etf  it's only a small %,btohqsg
Ohhh  where can I read up or have a summary of which company are doing well or not?,btohqsg
4 Signs You're Ready to Graduate from ETFs to Picking Stocks | The Motley Foolhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2021/08/23/4-signs-youre-ready-to-graduate-from-etfs-to-picki/,btohqsg
Usually you can go to Tiger/Moomoo app  each stock ticker will have its own news/opinions/analysis  then you can work from there,btohqsg
Hmm I'm not at that level where u analyse all the technical stuff but you can see the past performance as a gauge and ask yourself whether the company is well known and has good potential: for ex: Microsoft  apple etc. Stock picking might have greater upside than etfs bit also much greater risk / ups and downs,btohqsg
Has anyone heard of the Tesla stock split come this 9/12? What does it mean for current investors?,btohqsg
If the spilt is true  our share count and average price will split as per the stated split ratio and nothing much will change,btohqsg
I most recently invested when their price was 1 000+ so what will that mean? It will be like 50:50?,btohqsg
hi guys  i just started investing  thinking of building reits portfolio  which 3 stocks should i do DCA ??,btohqsg
If the split is e.g 4:1 everything will be split by 4,btohqsg
Do you reckon I pull out from Tesla now if that os true?,btohqsg
1 share will become 4 shares$1000 will become 250/ share,btohqsg
Why do you want to pull out?,btohqsg
Does stock spilt usually have a positive or negative impact on share price?,btohqsg
I remember last time apple was 800+ before stock spilt,btohqsg
Ill be entering more during the split,btohqsg
if we look at the previous tesla split  its a positive impact,btohqsg
and I wont be surprised it will be the same effect again,btohqsg
positive sentiment to melow price for each share  thus more affordable for traders and investors to own it,btohqsg
So why don't Amazon and alphabet do stock split then? I would love to own those shares,btohqsg
is up to the companyocbc did a stock spilt before too,btohqsg

You can look at REITS (my Reit video)  banks stocks like DBS  and monopoly like SGX/Netlink Trust,btohqsg
Chris  would you recommend SBS / Sheng Shiong as dividend stocks?,btohqsg

hihi  new adult here. can i check which card is better if im spending about average 750 per month with the main expenditure in dining  transport (public/private half half) and online purchases (shopee etc.)? I'm thinking of EVOL or maybe the frank cc but unsure which is better. currently holding the uob amex cashback card -> grab card but not being able to add into apple pay is a hassle haha,btohqsg
I would do uob one (up to 500 general spend + grab/shopee additional cashback) along with uob amex>grabpay card for the remainder spending,btohqsg
Come to think of it  evol suits you better,btohqsg
Frank would be better if you have all the eligible categoriesSince max eligible spend is$416.67 online$416.67 contactlessFor evol you're capped at$250 online$250 contactlessAnd still need $100 eligible spend but does not earn cashback,btohqsg

Hello  sorry can I ask if anyone might know what is the usual processing time for international wiring from DBS Remit into Gemini?,btohqsg
Whats that? Is it bank transfer?,btohqsg
Okay I see! Thanks for this  I actually did a transfer last night but it‚Äôs still not in the Gemini account yet  so am wondering if it‚Äôs an aberration or a norm,btohqsg
Oooo waaa  u transfered into the acc stated acc ? Some cimb bank berhad right,btohqsg
It was to Silvergate  in USD,btohqsg
i did mine at around 7pm  money came in at 11pm,btohqsg
SGD for me is 15 mins,btohqsg
Usd have cut off time ah,btohqsg
SGD more efficient but you can only get BTC and ETH with SGD,btohqsg
if you do swapping then you incur the platform fees,btohqsg
Send to other platforms to do the swapping  not too expensive   coin prices fluctuates. It depends if u want convenience / efficiency,btohqsg
over night prices of coin may move up or down quite abit alrdy,btohqsg
Okay I see!! Thanks so much for the info above  really appreciate it,btohqsg
Guess I‚Äôll just wait a bit more to see how long more before the USD reaches Gemini haha  and will need to weigh the pros and cons of the coin fluctuations against savings on exchange rate conversion fees / speed of conversion,btohqsg
i used@wilflarestrategy  for Gemini it will be by 10pmQUOTEbefore 2PM settle your SGD to USD exchange at Moomoosend USD from Moomoo to DBS MCAby 5PM DBS MCA should receive your USDsend out anytime in the evening to FTX via DBS Remit by 8PM USD is on FTX ready for deploymentUNQUOTE,btohqsg
hahaha trying to spread your awesome strategy to the rest,btohqsg
I think it's better to convert a bulk and send more over. there are so many options for staking stablecoins these days and they offer better rates than say Asia's best bank üòÇ,btohqsg
yea there's a frictional cost if you have to keep converting every time you wanna buyif you are the sort to DCA weekly  then why not consider monthly?it's better to have a % of stables so you can take advantage of dipsand with so many opportunities to earn higher % interest rates on stablecoins  your opportunity cost of holding the money in the üè¶ is lower (or depending on your perspective  is now higher),btohqsg
wow nice  thanks so much for this info,btohqsg
are there any other resources online that you‚Äôd recommend reading up on  to learn more about this?,btohqsg
hi guys  quick question on IBKR. do you guys usually buy the market price or bid lower and wait for a match?,btohqsg
been waiting for a while for my bid to be matched lol. getting a little twitchy haha..,btohqsg
I buy in small batches so usually submit limit order slightly below current price,btohqsg
market value order is fine too because small trade size means the difference is small anyway,btohqsg
yeah imma cancel my bid offer by tomorrow,btohqsg
then fresh buy based on market price haha,btohqsg

its better to do a cash secured put on tesla since it is way above the 200 MA. any issues with the battery  factories or govt regulations can make its share price volatile. of cos can keep rolling the put too but need to prepare cash for taking in the loss first when u roll.,btohqsg

Has anyone compare buying Singapore stocks from ibkr versus poem?,btohqsg
In ibkr. While poem u hold the shares. That the main disadvantage. However if u don't care about voting or dont intend to hold for extended period. Then ibkr is the one. As cheaper commission. If u hold long run. Better to get from Singapore brokerage  to hold actual shares.,btohqsg
Oh I see. If purchase from ibkr to take advantage of fees  will we still get dividend through ibkr? I rrfering to local bank stocks.,btohqsg
Hihi anyone know how to change currency in revolut,btohqsg

(Wild Guess): Talking to myself about the recent Property News1) Property cooling measures  ABSD  TDSR  curb speculative and profiteering activities from property investment2) BTO supply to increase 35% in 2022 onwards  further dampening resale market demand3) REITs may see a favor as property investors look for alternatives,btohqsg
point 1 is very true. i think buying property for investment will not be relevant anymore in SG.,btohqsg
I'm guessing alot of those who speculate and buy their second properties  and use the rental income to finance the mortgage of their first property got burned bad due to covid  either with the loss of job or the lack of rental interest due to many expatriates heading back to their home country. So MAS is acting quick to make sure it's stopped.,btohqsg
If you want to transact  just use Instarem linked with Mastercard,btohqsg
17% ABSD for your second property is insane. even with 99-1  the 17% on 1% is a alot compared to 12% previously but i think maybe just maybe still can stomach...,btohqsg
"if joint tenancy to start with for first property  i think the chance to ""decouple"" to get your second property is already up in flames.",btohqsg
17% on 50% of the property value to decouple is mad!,btohqsg
sell first property and buy two?,btohqsg
Yes I suppose that's the only way  husband and wife buy one each. I believe there's a cooling off period of 6 months after you sell though? Need to check on this. It's gonna be a mess though logistically.,btohqsg
I am not sure about reimbursement or stamp duty if you dispose off your first property 6 months after you get your second one. I rmb vaguely reading something about this. Again  need to do some fact-finding to verify,btohqsg
It is still very risky  you have 6 months to sell off your existing home after you get your second property. If the above post I mentioned is true to begin with,btohqsg
Lets just assume a 2 bedder condo costs $1M. That's $170K of ABSD  excluding other surcharges that you need to put upfront. Haven't even start earning rental income / capital gains yet,btohqsg
You can do a lot of things with $170K,btohqsg
This is fine  non marketing nor advertising stuff,btohqsg
Revolut card approval how long it takes?,btohqsg
Virtual card is immediate for usePhysical card not sure,btohqsg
Just another question on resolut card. On the normal (free) card  is there any fee montly involved?,btohqsg
Exactly  property investment is not viable anymore in singapore,btohqsg
On this proprty topic  lets say i already bto with partner  name is 50/50 tenancy. Is there any way i can change to single name  then buy second property under her name?,btohqsg
I believe for hdb  decoupling has been outlawed by the gov,btohqsg
Unless divorce or Demise of partner,btohqsg
Hmm  unless i buy second property under my name?,btohqsg
I think at the start  during the hdb bto purchase  if you put one party as an essential occupier and one party as owner  then the occupier can buy a private property at 0% absd after the MOP has past.,btohqsg
This means the owner has to be able to afford the bto payment by his or herself,btohqsg
I mean the occupier can bank transfer the money to him or her la. But owner has to pay upfront,btohqsg
^ all these is just from my understanding. Pls do more research to substantiate üôÉ,btohqsg
Painful but necessary. I'm guessing many locals overstretched and are suffering now cos of covid due to loss of job or severe lack of rental income due to expats leaving the country. MAS is doing this to protect the banks in case many homeowners end up defaulting on their mortgages.

The property market is behaving really absurdly here. I think when covid hit  most analysts were predicting softening of the property market by mid 2021. But it did not happen,btohqsg
2nd property is no longer for regular folks (like me). More for legacy planning purpose if you have really large resources,btohqsg
Just buy your property for own stay  and stay invested in the markets,btohqsg
Yeah  does not make sense anymore,btohqsg
Expats leaving country sounds like a key pointer,btohqsg
Do anyone know about accrued interest?,btohqsg
My initial thoughts about Syfe neo brokerage:1) Fractional shares is a plus vs Tiger/Moomoo. But IBKR already has it2) Syfe Trade will probably have nicer UI/UX then IBKR app3) FX rate still lose to IBKR anyway4) I will join the waitlist to try it out  get some sign-up gifts and publush my review for early adopters,btohqsg
If you used CPF oa to pay for housing  then the loaned amount will just accrue interest at 2.5% p.a.,btohqsg
So if u refund back the amount u use for hdb  there is no accrued interest?,btohqsg
You have to payback your loan (2.6% rate or 1.5% bank loan) plus your accrued interest (2.5%) back to CPF OA,btohqsg
Just paying back to your own pocket,btohqsg
And this is why I want to reach FRS because once reached  you can withdraw the excess amount anyway  treat CPF like a bank atm,btohqsg
If payback full loan  then accrued interest will stop increase?,btohqsg
Will the accrued interest left inpose interest?,btohqsg
No lah  where got interest on interest,btohqsg
Do not know cpf will charge interest on that if didn't payback accrued interest?,btohqsg
It just meams that  even if you finished paying your home loan  but your accrued interest is not returned yet  it will contninue to accrue interest until you do a voluntary contribution to housing refund,btohqsg
But if you not selling house  don't pay also ok. Just that when you sold  the proceeds will first go to paying accrued interest,btohqsg
What if vc to refund housing sum  no interest on the balance accrued interest?,btohqsg
Yup. Don't sell then is ok,btohqsg
"Can't just use OA ""for free"" üòÇüòÇ",btohqsg
I‚Äôm hoping it can let us set a percentage of distribution to various etf in a profile and we just need to click buy and it‚Äôll split whatever amount we buy amongst the etf.,btohqsg
Good suggestion  something like what Robinhood can do. This would be a good feature that is unique in Singapore,btohqsg
Housing loan = Principal + Interest + Accrued Interest. If refund only principal + interest  accrued interest will still go on. Accrued interest will only stop after the full amount is re-paid,btohqsg
If full amount repaid  there is no more compound interest on the balance accrued interest?,btohqsg
Some people do leave $1 inside just to standby if they require CPF OA to be used again in the event of retrench and need more cash on hand or other purpose.If you cleared all finish and in if the above situation strikes. I think u will need to redo with the lawyer to activate OA for monthly deduction.,btohqsg

Anyone using cardup   worthing to use to pay rent or fees etc ?,btohqsg
I use it for my prudential insurance monthly premium,btohqsg
Insurance premium does not count towards your monthly spendings,btohqsg
It uses diff mcc when you use cardup,btohqsg
Have been getting my quarterly rebates,btohqsg
But ofc you pay cardup abt 2.6% fee,btohqsg
If self contribute to cpf sa can earn tax relief?,btohqsg
Should watch my video tonight. Talking about cpf,btohqsg
If sa reach certain amount  still can self contribute? Or still can ?,btohqsg
Then how is it worth after rebate,btohqsg
If your premium around 500 or 1000  then is about 0.8% cashback  if its 2000  then its about 2.47%,btohqsg
Sadly my premium is only 200  so I need to spend 300 more per month on the one card.,btohqsg
cool  can consider using CRO then wiht 3% cashback,btohqsg
Qn. FRS increases yearly. If I reach FRS in SA by end 2021  can I still contribute $8k and enjoy the tax relief in 2022  given that the CPF contributions will sure exceed the new FRS in 2022.Or your window will open every Jan when the new FRS is increased and that is the opportunity to top up?,btohqsg
No opportunity. The interest credited will hit next year FRS anyway,btohqsg
The interest rates shld still be count as normal right? I means every month interest credited to Yr cpf account? But sure not of opportunity if u find better investment opportunities elsewhere. Opportunity cost,btohqsg
If did not find opportunity. And have free cash laying around. Might as well get the addition interest rates. Just my 2 cent.,btohqsg
This year topup is still 7k to get tax relief?,btohqsg
Sa can use for buying stocks?,btohqsg
I will join this voice chat tomorrow with Boon Tee. Feel free to join in,btohqsg
Interest is calculated monthly but only credited once during year end,btohqsg
The FRS amount is the based on the current amount for the year or the calculated amount once you reach the retirement age?,btohqsg
Will keep increasing until you reach 55,btohqsg
So need to top-up yearly to match it,btohqsg
Once you reach frs  the interest earned (4%) will cover the annual FRS increase (3%),btohqsg
Frs is total from the 3 accounts?,btohqsg
Oh  when 55  all 3 account amount will transfer to ra?,btohqsg
Will transfer from SA first then fr OA.,btohqsg
So both sa n oa amount add up n transfer to ra?,btohqsg
Take from SA first  if SA not enough then take from OA,btohqsg
This is why CPF shielding is needed  to move the SA out first so RA can be formed by taking out from OA,btohqsg
So after ra is created  can still use cash to topup sa?,btohqsg
After age 55. You can only top up RA,btohqsg
Still can do VCA to the 3 accounts.,btohqsg
So is can or not? Lol,btohqsg
Yes  but only tax reliefs for SEP for VC3A,btohqsg
No dirrct top up to SA. Only indirect top up via VC3A by percentage allocation,btohqsg
Self employed person. You need to watch my cpf videos.,btohqsg
Oh i tot sep is September. Lol,btohqsg
So we can still cash topup sa after 55 to earn 4pc interest,btohqsg
After fulfulling the RA amount  the remaining SA can withdraw in cash anytime like a bank?,btohqsg
Yes  after 55 and only the amounts above FRS that is not reserved (excluding RSTU SA Top-up and its interest earned),btohqsg
Oh after 55 only. But cant voluntarily top up SA after 55 right,btohqsg
Anyone knows about this on Tiger Brokers and able to explain? Found this on Tiger Desktop > Assets,btohqsg
I don't have a Tiger Brokers account but based on the description  it is similar to the SGX Securities Borrowing and Lending programme.When you long a share  you can lend it to the interested party and gain some interest during this period.,btohqsg
you need to read the detail  in the event that your share is on loaned and you want to sell the share  what do you need to do.,btohqsg

Please excuse my lack of knowledgeS&P 500  INX what is the difference to the rest like voo  cspx  spy?,btohqsg
S&P500 is the index  which only provides the constituents and weights of the companies. You cannot invest in index directly  but you can invest via exchange traded funds (ETF) that track the ETF,btohqsg
these three are just ETFs by different providers that track the same index,btohqsg
SPY is the oldest and largest and has the most liquidity. VOO is provided by Vanguard  which is famous for offering extremely cheap ETF. These two are quite similar,btohqsg
CSPX is provided by iShares (BlackRock)  this is UCITS fund and listed on UK exchange. The withholding tax is lower for this (15% WHT vs. normal 30%),btohqsg
Difference between S&P500 ETFs: VOO  SPY  CSPX,btohqsg

You better find out from futu. Rather than asking here.,btohqsg
Its ok. Seems like no one here use the function,btohqsg
I'm not sure about futu  but for Tiger  it will be automatically converted to SGD and then credited to your brokerage account,btohqsg

Just dont use cash on Endowus,btohqsg
Syfe is using custom portfolio to buy cspx,btohqsg

Hi Honey Money community  question! I understand Grabpay has an option where your points can be converted to Krisflyer points.I just want to know  what is better here? Use Krisflyer credit card or Grab Pay? Which gives you most points for miles? Is the difference a lot?,btohqsg
Maybank Friends and Family 8% for all including subcription entertainment,btohqsg
The best miles card are not miles card  but rewards card like DBS WWMC  Citi Rewards and hsbc revo. Check my video on that,btohqsg
Power! But cause I am using UOB Absolute now  Grabpay seems like the only way for me to earn miles with SQ. Do you think it‚Äôs comparable to those you showed on YouTube?,btohqsg
I think if you want to earn miles  need to have a good spending power consistently. To me that number is above $1000 to be meaningful miles accumulation. Because Krisflyer miles will expire in 3 years,btohqsg
You‚Äôve got a point  but my GrabPay points doesn‚Äôt expire. I can hold it in my card till I am ready to convert to miles as well right? üò¨,btohqsg
Any referral codes for after Jan 1st?,btohqsg
Grabpay conversion to miles is just poor value  would not recommend,btohqsg
Hsbc revo has 3 year expiry for points then plus 3 years in krisflyer  should be good enough,btohqsg
Hello  are there any thoughts on whether to go for CitiPM or CitiRewards/HSBC Revolution? Understand that CitiPM miles never expire unlike Citi/HSBC Reward points (with expiry of 5 years/37 months respectively)  but also that the Citi Rewards/HSBC Revolution has a higher earn rate of 4mpd (compared to 1.2 for CitiPM).,btohqsg
always go for 4mpd when you have consistent spending. 1.2mpd will take you ages.,btohqsg
i see  thanks Chris! Would there be any situations where you‚Äôd recommend using CitiPM? Also  wanted to know if it‚Äôs possible to stack Amaze cash back with CitiPM or any other cards  to get cashback/rewards on both Amaze and the underlying credit card?,btohqsg
Dont think so  i havent touch the card for 3 years,btohqsg
Amaze can stack with any singapore mastercard credit card,btohqsg
Hahaha okay I see  thanks for this Chris üòÄ,btohqsg
Based on what I saw:125 KF miles = $1500 grabpoints = $1Grab points convert to KF miles20000 points -> 2000 milesIt‚Äôs like $40 -> $16Do correct me if I‚Äôm wrong,btohqsg
Anyone applied credit card through moneysmart before?,btohqsg
Long long time ago  but now I just apply with Singsaver via Honey Money SG's link,btohqsg
I did with it for my AMEX and Citi cards,btohqsg
This is just a discussion next us fed will rise interest rate and stop printing money and collecting back money. Should we withholding back the s &p 500 fund and invest again when the price is low. What's every one view on this?,btohqsg
You mean cash on advance from credit card?,btohqsg
How do u withdraw from cc,btohqsg
When you withdraw cash from a credit card  it is a cash advance,btohqsg
How do you deposit into cc?,btohqsg
Some cards offsets the cashback automatically in the next bill while some accumulates until you tell the bank to offset,btohqsg
Withdrawing from credit card will have a charge,btohqsg
Why dont you just spend and pay when bill comes? Instead of prepaying 50k (not sure if that is even possible),btohqsg
10k bill  you will only pay 9.7k to amex,btohqsg
you close the account amex will just absorb back the cashback,btohqsg
for TCB they offset the cashback in the same transection month,btohqsg
so it will disappear at the statement date,btohqsg
offsetting the bill is the same as getting the money in your pocket,btohqsg
there are no categories on TCB,btohqsg
its 1.5% on all eligible spends,btohqsg
no the cashback stays in the card,btohqsg
It will off set your bill at the end of the month so you pay lesser to AMEX,btohqsg
3% is only for a limited time,btohqsg
will revert back to 1.5% after,btohqsg
Unless you are already spending the 10k  go ahead.If not  dont bother. Not worth the $300,btohqsg
hi guys  anyone knows any credit card that counted funds transfer to other banks as spending. for eg monthly transfer of money to dbs and ocbc using credit card.,btohqsg

Based on advance estimates*  the Singapore economy grew by 5.9 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter of 2021  moderating from the 7.1 per cent growth in the previous quarter. On a quarter-on-quarter seasonally-adjusted basis  the economy expanded by 2.6 per cent in the fourth quarter  faster than the 1.2 per cent growth in the preceding quarter.For the whole of 2021  the economy grew by 7.2 per cent  rebounding from the 5.4 per cent contraction in 2020.*The advance GDP estimates for the fourth quarter of 2021 are computed largely from data in the first two months of the quarter (i.e.  October and November 2021). They are intended as an early indication of GDP growth in the quarter and are subject to revision when more comprehensive data become available.,btohqsg
Was there a review on CRO?,btohqsg
Yes I think so  just need to stake differing amounts of CRO for the level/tier card that you want,btohqsg
Haha I think is really based on personal preference. My sense is that generally most might either get the Royal Indigo/Jade Green and Ruby Steel since they offer marginal benefits over the Midnight Blue eg. Spotify  Netflix and Airport Lounge Access. But also depends your own conviction about CRO (and hence the amount you are willing to stake) cos you‚Äôll need to lock in for about 6 months I think,btohqsg
Oh ok it seems blue card dont need staking,btohqsg
Indigo and above will get 10% pa on the staking. But stake at sgd5k.,btohqsg
If staked amount dip due to cro dip  need to topup again?,btohqsg
$500 red card is more affordable  but no staking returns.,btohqsg
What do you mean by no staking returns?,btohqsg
If you get the red card  the $500 staked does not give you any weekly returns. It just gets locked in for the red card benefits.,btohqsg
How about blue or green card?,btohqsg
But weekly only like a dollar or sometbing like that only right,btohqsg
Say at the point of staking it was sgd1 per CRO  so you staked 5000 CRO for Indigo card.In 1 year you will get 500 CRO (regardless of price fluctuation). So every week you get 500/12 or 41.66 CRO.,btohqsg
Sorry  should be 500/52 or 9.61 CRO.,btohqsg
Calculations are based on CRO  not fiat value.,btohqsg
Aiya regret getting the ruby card,btohqsg
To clarify  blue card which is plastic card  does not require staking. It give 1% CRO rebate for purchases.The green / Indigo card (metal card) gives 3% purchase rebate and 10% from the sgd5k staking.,btohqsg
Let's wait for Honey Money review. Probably can get clearer picture.,btohqsg
"@ChrisHMSG  I just realized that I have $10K in CPF ""available for Gold investment"". How do I take that out for gold investments??",btohqsg
If you get the red card  the $500 staked does not give you any weekly returns. It just gets locked in for the red card benefits.,btohqsg
Then might as well get red card direct,btohqsg
You don't take it out. You link your OA to your gold bullion exchange. Regarding the specifics  I'm not sure,btohqsg
ForCrypto.comCRO Visa card  need minimum Ruby tier (500 SGD of CRO staked) to get any useful benefits,btohqsg
Airport lounge  spotify  netflix benefits all these are just fluff. Most importantly  do you believe in CRO to grow in the future  if yes then stake more and you can unlock hogher tier in Crypto Earn,btohqsg
If you staked 5000 sgd cro just for netflix and stuff. Just a 10% drop in cro enough to wipe all the benefits you gained,btohqsg
If get blue card first  later can upgrade to other cards free?,btohqsg
The upgrade will still require the staking conditions. There is also admin charge of USD50 for card delivery. Only first card will be delivered FOC.,btohqsg
Yes  true. Need to believe in CRO and DYOR.,btohqsg
So all in all  if I am a holder of a Ruby Card  I will not enjoy the benefits of weekly returns right? Except for anything above Ruby card?,btohqsg

Those not listed are not eligible,btohqsg
Wrong. U earn points  which can convert to Cashback or miles,btohqsg
I don't get why you keep want to put cash in your credit card  it's not a deposit account,btohqsg
No annual fees for scb smart,btohqsg
I think what you are looking for is a debit card,btohqsg
Credit card is pretty self explanatory. Credit = lend money to spend and pay later,btohqsg
It doesn't matter whether you are spending the money you deposit beforehand  as long as you don't go beyond your budget and pay you bills,btohqsg
they are just numbers on your bill  no need to top up first and then spend,btohqsg
for the smartcard does buying groceries at sheng siong also eligible for cashback?,btohqsg

A recession is a macroeconomic term that refers to a significant decline in general economic activity in a designated region. It had been typically recognized as two consecutive quarters of economic decline  as reflected by GDP in conjunction with monthly indicators such as a rise in unemployment,btohqsg
First  recession is normal. It is not a matter of if but when,btohqsg
Secondly  it is very hard to time when recession is going to hit. So the common advice is just stay invested and ride it out,btohqsg
On the tapering and interest rate hike  it has been communicated. QE ends by March 2022. We will see 2 to 4 rate hikes this year. How many rate hikes depending on 1) economic activity  2) inflation  3) covid situation,btohqsg
I personally not too worried of a big crash  but definitely should adjust the expectation. It is unlikely to see the crazy rally in the past 1-2 years e.g. shitty stocks also can rocket,btohqsg
Those were caused by extreme amount of liquidity.. now US fed is starting to suck out the liquidity via tapering and gradual interest rate hikes,btohqsg
If that the case there should be a drop it correction,btohqsg
