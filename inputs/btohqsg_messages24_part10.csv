Hm did she graduate within the past 12 months? based on the eligibility criteria on HDB's website  yall won't be eligible for deferred income scheme  meaning that loan and grant will be assessed per normal (apply for HFE).https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/buying-a-flat/buying-procedure-for-new-flats/booking-of-flat,btohqsg
She hasn't graduated yet from her pt degree.since both of us are unemployed  we also do not qualify for any loans as well?,btohqsg
Based on the eligibility criteria  technically needs to be FT degree to qualify for deferred assessment. BUT really think you should contact HDB to check on your situation. Maybe it's possible to get deferred income assessment on a case-by-case basis,btohqsg
