i heard us stonks very tosik,btohqsg
today is red day  but its going up again,btohqsg
A lot in RC is because their values align with the RC  they are motivated by the programme not the accommodation,btohqsg
Maybe I try another RC next year bah or hopefully one of the RC can pick me,btohqsg
not sure if rc look at alvl grades anot,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t know about RC until this year someone told me about it,btohqsg
Why tho  cause if you BTC kid  like RC really donâ€™t help much in travelling  so I advise you to think whether you really want the programme. Coz travelling is Argh  travelling + programme you donâ€™t like is Argh X 2,btohqsg
Ok then thatâ€™s good  try next year bah,btohqsg
The moment apps open  I went in to see the question then log out  I submitted my apps the final day. I spent the whole window writing and writing the essay lol,btohqsg
That was how scared I was that I will not get,btohqsg
Wtf that kinda shit will get you cancelled in Tembusu,btohqsg
Why donâ€™t you report to whatever NTUâ€™s OSA is called,btohqsg
If the env is so toxic  maybe itâ€™s best for you to leave,btohqsg
U need to climb the ranks,btohqsg
U need to become more toxic that anyone else,btohqsg
I once tried that and it just makes me sadder and sadder,btohqsg
Even weird donâ€™t deserve to be treated like that Friend,btohqsg
This sounds like the kind of thing people would do in BMT,btohqsg
Good but if they still affect you it might be best to leave  idk do you feel relieved after getting chased out coz of COVID? Coz thatâ€™d benchmark your net feelings for staying there,btohqsg
Take my words as/smost of the time,btohqsg
Bahaha how I feel about UTown too  Iâ€™m just amazed at how Long I can last without going out of NUS while staying on campus,btohqsg
I tot got chem ques sia,btohqsg
How does one be an extrovert man  I honestly dk how to classify myself,btohqsg
Thats what i usually go for,btohqsg
When I see my extrovert Friend share their escapades  I be like I WANT TO DO THAT TOO! but not with those ppl argh,btohqsg
But my circle of friends definitely will not be up for those things,btohqsg
But I enjoy their company  but I really sad havenâ€™t got the chance to do extro stuff  but usually I find the extro ppl too obnoxious,btohqsg
a small price to pay to retain ur sanity miss,btohqsg
that's why I can't relate to people,btohqsg
its like talking abt strict asian parenting,btohqsg
@Livingundertherockso what do you call somebody that likes doing extro stuff but dislike typical extro ppl,btohqsg
Lucifer is a show about the devil,btohqsg
lucifer  suits  black mirror  money heist,btohqsg
Shouting isnâ€™t extroversion itâ€™s just being annoying,btohqsg
smart guy brings tgt a team of diff backgrounds,btohqsg
tries to get his ass into the mint,btohqsg
Why does it sound like an episode of rick and morty,btohqsg
print himself a small loan of a million dollars,btohqsg
Money Heist suck  give me back my Nano and Christian,btohqsg
You son of a bitch  Iâ€™m in,btohqsg
u can be introverted  be ok with socialising,btohqsg
but ull probably feel like tired afterwarda,btohqsg

Im definitely not enjoying life without much of a social life  but extroverts ard me just make me wanna roll my eyes all the time,btohqsg
Yea Yea Iâ€™m a Play Responsibly kinda person  my friends are just Responsible people  and Iâ€™m no fun and canâ€™t tolerate the entirely Playful people. Stuck in the cursed middle. :(,btohqsg
Was my intention then COVID happened  yea,btohqsg
Acc is the most susceptible to tech disruption within finance,btohqsg
Big 4 pays 3k and ask u work till 3am,btohqsg
GES is subjected to non-resp bias,btohqsg
Like not many ppl will be happy to oh hi! Iâ€™m unemployed!,btohqsg
army ask u work till 6am and pays you 1k,btohqsg
Army is obligation where got good comparison,btohqsg
technically youâ€™re not obligated to do it,btohqsg
but superiors pressure you with disciplinary action,btohqsg
i dont rlly like that movie,btohqsg
Idk I can only answer that on 2 May,btohqsg
there's plenty to do at home,btohqsg

"Virus Vanguard  no more.The COVID-19 superhero team that debuted on the Singapore Government website yesterday has disappeared after ""quite a lot of feedback on the characters"".https://cna.asia/3anZq7A",btohqsg
Message fromReBÃ«Å‚ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ Reginalddeleted. Reason: external link(?),btohqsg
Theoretically  paying for ppl to use it saves you more money then storage costs,btohqsg
They're paying people to take it so they don't get fined for improper storage of oil,btohqsg
But practically  theyâ€™ll not be doing that  the most they will do is sell very cheap,btohqsg
Best time to invest in oil ?,btohqsg
If youâ€™re confident oil prices wonâ€™t drop further and make more companies go bust lol,btohqsg
And they expect you to draw the dd/ss curve such that the equilibrium price is negative,btohqsg
I think there was a similar ques,btohqsg
If they cant reduce interest rates further they will have to use QE instead,btohqsg
It is 2016 that is diff i think,btohqsg
2017 is the new syllabus paper,btohqsg
i know ppl who decide to dump money into a whole lot of oil rn,btohqsg
dunno what the fuck they thinking,btohqsg
the dip was just for futures,btohqsg
actually why everyone nvr buy stocks now since eventually the value will rise,btohqsg
well the SPX did rise as US recorded even more people filing for unemployment,btohqsg
why higher unemployment will make spx rise,btohqsg
because the market is irrational and insane,btohqsg
and markets will stay insane longer than u can stay solvent,btohqsg
lesson of the day: cash is king/s,btohqsg
that makes stocks a good investment rn?,btohqsg
it makes it a bad investment rn,btohqsg
cuz ur more likely to lose money,btohqsg
just like the amount of braincells i have!,btohqsg
So you've 3 vaginas worth of braincells ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±,btohqsg

They want reduce to 15%  including cutting workers from consumer facing companies,btohqsg
Medical definitely cannot  plus got increased medical worker demand,btohqsg

Even started to diet and work out,btohqsg
I still want my ORD trip :(,btohqsg
Guess I'll just grab KFC tonight,btohqsg
If you can draw the molecular orbitals using a coordinate system  it will work for you.(In fact you can create vectored orbital diagrams this way),btohqsg
Any reccss for good chem pkgs? I know no advertising but tbh this shit needs advertising cuz there are a few latex chem pkgs dunno which one works well,btohqsg
might as well close all fast food outlets,btohqsg
but ya I tried HOMO/LUMO IIRC,btohqsg
So there should be stuff for those,btohqsg
As long as you can do HOMO/LUMO,btohqsg
Is considered a really well-featured orbital diagram IMO,btohqsg
Entry to wet markets and supermarkets will be based on your NRIC number  so as to thin the crowds and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.https://cna.asia/2Kl78EX,btohqsg

It does exist for exams marked in Singapore.,btohqsg
As long as my Indian muthu prata shop doesn't close I'm ok,btohqsg
What kind of F&B is closing,btohqsg
Before bbt was invented how ppl live sia  the same lah,btohqsg
only the most essential services will be opened,btohqsg
There was no life on earth,btohqsg
liho  gongcha and koi can close down,btohqsg
Until God said  Let there be BBT,btohqsg
Basically they want to reduce the number of people currently commuting by another 25%,btohqsg
So they want only the most essential of businesses to continue,btohqsg
i feel like prob fast food all will close,btohqsg
they said MTI will upload a full list of continuing business after the press conf,btohqsg
valu$ shop essential but all closed,btohqsg
depends on what they say leh,btohqsg
so we just wait i guess,btohqsg
Bee Cheng Hiang and Fragrance need close too,btohqsg
say they got unity and guardian in one mall,btohqsg
They closed on their own accord,btohqsg
Who tf would eat Bak Kwa rn,btohqsg
i suspect valu$ close cos their permit is not fnb or grocery but just retail goods,btohqsg
its not legit staple food mah,btohqsg
Bubble tea runs in my veins,btohqsg
pls shove a boba up yo butt if you think bbt is essential,btohqsg
I went wtf when they were allowed to remain open,btohqsg
bbt essential for mental health ðŸ˜«,btohqsg
If u let the clot gain more thrombokinases,btohqsg
bbt remained open same reason why hairdressers n glasses stores remained opento keep up morale n retain some base level of normalcy so sgporeans dont spiral into panic,btohqsg
thank god for saloons still opened,btohqsg
And sometimes John is that dot above the i,btohqsg
had to get a haircut with my mask on LOL,btohqsg
Haircut maybe  defn not specs level,btohqsg

Specs spoil donâ€™t need work/study Liao har,btohqsg
any1 did the sgis scholarship assessment,btohqsg
i cut my hair now no ine know,btohqsg
maybe optometrists cld open but retail glasses stores like owndays didnt need tobut i guess they probs share same permit n hard to differentiate,btohqsg
If u messed up and made yourself bald no one would know,btohqsg
but i think owndays got their own optometrist right,btohqsg
those that have everyth tgt then they open,btohqsg
those that sell only certain stuff close,btohqsg

but then it's dry also ðŸ˜”,btohqsg
Thanks for calling me smiley face,btohqsg
breh they simultaneously stretched and tightened the cb,btohqsg
She ruined all the mundane things,btohqsg
Back in the good old days when er... was just any other ordinary expression of hesitation,btohqsg
About what? After all  she did give this ambiguous response to an act of goodwill from taiwan,btohqsg
But it is she who opened up a hole for assumptions,btohqsg
F&B outlets (including hawker centres  coffee-shops  food courts  restaurants  fast food  and others; for takeaway and delivery orders only) and their supporting operations (including central kitchens); except predominantly beverage  packaged snack  confectionery and dessert stores  as well as all F&B outlets in parks (except on Pulau Ubin).,btohqsg
when i checked at 7pm they didnâ€™t have the except clause so they just added it,btohqsg
"the only thing not ambiguous is that ""err..."" is an extremely unprofessional response to a country which has lent a helping hand",btohqsg
Erm but letâ€™s not get off track here,btohqsg
Whether the err is justified or not  is different from who ruined err,btohqsg
More like now it has undertones haha,btohqsg
Yea  so Iâ€™m interested to hear your perspective,btohqsg
How it is those that made the assumption,btohqsg
At that time  singapore had just instituted the mask policy  a major u turn from the past recommendation to not wear mask unless unhealthy.,btohqsg
sorry to disrupt the convo but Skype got whiteboard?,btohqsg
She didnâ€™t need to comment at all.,btohqsg
plus dont forget  countries give masks frequently to each other in this period as a sign of solidarity and help,btohqsg
Sheâ€™s not in a position that requires her to respond.,btohqsg
But would you support her to direct the err... to PRC if it was PRC that wants to give us mask?,btohqsg
I find it sad that the only reason why we got out of this geopol crisis  triggered by her  relatively unscathed in tangible terms is because Taiwan has abysmal geopol standing.If it was the PRC on the other hand  HOHOHO  wrath of the CCP on your way.,btohqsg
no? government said dont need wear  save the mask for the frontliners,btohqsg
urged us not to hoard masks,btohqsg
Even if it is not PRC  and some democratic western nation  theyâ€™ll be more reluctant to work with us on things like FTA in the future.,btohqsg
that was 4 disposable face masks,btohqsg
there is a global shortage btw,btohqsg
true  but singaporeans were DISCOURAGED from wearing them  so do you think the people who listen to the government (which are the majority btw) would bother to go down and get?,btohqsg
To reduce mask buying  why need to reduce? Shortage.,btohqsg
so why do they stop overbuying in the first place?,btohqsg
because they are aware that there might be a lack,btohqsg
besides we dont know how long this virus will last  and our national reserves are finite. A donation from Taiwan will be welcome anytime. A donation from any country in fact,btohqsg
but you were saying that the govt asked the people to stop buying in order to avoid overbuying (with the assumption that singaporeans will overbuy). So no  they wont stop buying. And yes  this takes a toll on national reserves,btohqsg
exactly  they will keep buying. So therefore we need more right  especially for critical medical operations,btohqsg
Even if we donâ€™t need  even if we argue that Taiwanâ€™s actions are 100% diplomatic posturing  that doesnâ€™t warrant her expressing err... like that!,btohqsg
A geopol crisis is no joke,btohqsg
imagine if the shelves are swept by all the panic buyers. What will our frontline staff get?,btohqsg
at this point of time  more masks are better than less masks,btohqsg
A geopol crisis amidst a global pandemic no less,btohqsg
and we should appreciate anyone who volunteers to give them to us,btohqsg
so what? You already said that singaporeans have a hoarder mentality. Circuit breaker aint gonna keep them home and stop them from buying masks,btohqsg
We do appreciate what we have at present  but that doesnt mean we should middle finger anyone that offers help,btohqsg
"unlike your ""project""  this virus is far from over.",btohqsg
your analogy only works if the virus is eradicated and THEN they offered to give us masks,btohqsg
then we can all say they wayang,btohqsg
Ho Chingâ€™s portfolio is uniqueWhat she says will be scrutinisedWhat she doesnâ€™t say will notPoliticians are scrutinised for what they say AND DONT say because theyâ€™re our legal representatives.Whereas Ho Chingâ€™s words will be scrutinised because PM Family  what she doesnâ€™t say wonâ€™t be scrutinised because she was not expected to say anything.What Iâ€™m trying to argue here is  she shouldnâ€™t have said anything  but not because of the deafening silence you proposed  but because of her 1/2 way representation of SG.,btohqsg
what are these solutions when the masks we bought runs out?1. buy more from japan (taxpayer's money+we dont know if they will have extra to sell us)2. Self production (still a long way away)donations are the most immediate and cost effective solution which will help us meet the demand for masks,btohqsg
At this time  the best course of action is to be appreciative tbh  we never know when we need their help in this coronavirus situation. After all  they are one of the more effective nations in controlling the covid,btohqsg
because singapore refuses to disclose its national reserves,btohqsg
even when the opposition questioned them,btohqsg
As for the mask situation  no country will disclose rn,btohqsg
Im using their reuseable one lmao,btohqsg
which btw is proven to be more suited to pollen and less suited to viruses,btohqsg
I mean I presume that you guys were also amongst those who hoarded food supplies,btohqsg
I do agree that the singaporeans are spineless in other ways  but being grateful for another countries masks is good diplomacy,btohqsg
Something kinda irrelevant  but have you guys seen the articles that talked about the ineffectiveness of the re-usable cloth masks that were recently distributed by the government?,btohqsg
like instead ofno mask recommended -->not discouraged (ho ching's fb post) -->encouraged (LHL's statement) -->mandatory (Lawrence Wong CB measures)They could have went straight to enforcing mandatory masks without taking a 4 week roundabout thing to avoid damaging the ruling party's repute,btohqsg
I mean I work in an essential position in the saf so my work never ends (ORD soon thank god),btohqsg
Well thought it may not be as good as the surgical mask  it could still help to keep your body fluid to yourself,btohqsg
I suppose with many people not having enough mask to use on a daily basis  we can be choosers then ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
that was the week that virus infections shot up to 447 cases,btohqsg
if they had implemented the measures 3 weeks before instead of taking a 3 week u turn  this wouldnt have happened,btohqsg
if they had enforced earlier  you cannot deny that more people would have worn it,btohqsg
what about the older generation who take recommendations from the PAP seriously?,btohqsg
"those are the people who will listen to the ""not sick no need mask"" policy which stretched way into feb-march",btohqsg
when the virus was pretty damn serious,btohqsg
"you cant cover up every failing of the PAP by saying the people would ""do something anyway"" or ""disobey governmental instructions"". Then whats the govt for? I get you to be PM easier haha",btohqsg
yes  perhaps. But you claim that singapore no shortage what  and everyone already have 6-8 packs of masks at standby,btohqsg
Ok I will take you on that.Why canâ€™t Govt just buyback all masks on the private market and nationalise the sales of mask? decide to sell each household 1 box via the RC/CCs  no panic buy possible.,btohqsg
Because they donâ€™t even have enough to sell 1 box/household,btohqsg
"and even if so  couldnt they ease the people into masks gradually  rather than a ""not sick no need wear policy"" to reduce the abruptness of the u turn",btohqsg
lol got people 1 person buy 12 bbtðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Well  you must realise that those belong to the more kiasi and more privileged in society. Those out around normally wont care. Even now  theres a bunch of people (300 so far iirc) who were caught not wearing masksIn the SAF  I was asked to remove a mask I was wearing because of govt and camp policy.,btohqsg
before this  confirm have even more people dont wear masks,btohqsg
^ if the only reason why they discourage is panic buy  why cannot do the above? Check IC = cannot buy excess le what,btohqsg
Yes  the whole cb could have been done faster if the govt didnt take 4 weeks to u turn,btohqsg
It doesn't have to be a mask iirc,btohqsg
I mean  it's clear within the SAF that right up until the point where all the BMT enlistees had to pack up and leave  there was a 'no URTI symptoms no mask' policy  which demonstrates the stance of MINDEF  as well as the government as a whole,btohqsg
That was the start of April  mind you,btohqsg
They didn't treat it as seriously as they should,btohqsg
Ong Ye Kung legit brought forward the June holidays,btohqsg
plus what you just said implies the fact that you (and the government) are betting on the presumption that singaporeans wont listen to government instructions...which is really not how I think a crisis as big as this should be dealt with,btohqsg
Means the kids will be studying during June,btohqsg
Okay it's irrelevant  but I completely disagree that Singaporeans tend to look at things with skepticism,btohqsg
this is probably more of the case,btohqsg
yeah I mean it goes both ways. They could be skeptical about the government's response and skeptical about the severeness of the disease.Some of them think the disease is not as serious as it is and some think that the government is not doing enough,btohqsg
you are betting on the second case,btohqsg
no  when I look around me at that time I see that most people aint masked up  but of course thats simply an observation,btohqsg
Organic Chem not in O Level Chem anymore,btohqsg
Then what o level chem learn sia,btohqsg
im not in uni haha but its an observation around me. Maybe in poly/JC where the students are more educated and less old folks  you can see the increase in mask wearing,btohqsg
Not v big deal actually it is just a small topic in emath,btohqsg
Wonder what their definition of snacks is,btohqsg
This month is gonna be loOONG,btohqsg
I'm still gonna get my chocolates,btohqsg
Nothing is going to stop me from getting chocolates,btohqsg
But the occasional milk chocolate bar is good,btohqsg
"I mean you cant fault them for not stocking up. All they hear on the news is just ""not sick no need mask"" ""virus well controlled in singapore"" ""plans to lower dorscon level (remember that?)"".People act based on the news they hear. Older people get more news via the government. Perhaps you are more fortunate  but do remember that plenty of old people  especially the less fortunate will put this disease at the back of their minds",btohqsg
but you can only enter on certain days,btohqsg
depends on the last digit of your IC,btohqsg
So I usually buy kinder brenuo or smth,btohqsg
Tbh seeing how MOE has those common last topics,btohqsg
Makes sense that my year SS had Venice as CLT,btohqsg
The tiny ones don't seem worth to me,btohqsg
wah i want kms eh sch hols brought forward wtf,btohqsg
yea but i'm stuck at home ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
even if let you have in june still can't travel lah unless to taiwan,btohqsg
Even if thereâ€™s holiday in June u still canâ€™t travel,btohqsg
Tbh the only thing I can say is,btohqsg
Especially for the graduating cohorts they get to skip out on quite a bit of topics lol,btohqsg
covid-19 is a blessing in disguise for some others,btohqsg
I cannot find on Moe website,btohqsg
haven't graduate lah this year As HAHA,btohqsg
like as in graduating end of this year,btohqsg
My sergeant say we're doing field camp in Minecraft,btohqsg
this actually happened for some Japanese students,btohqsg
TP will lease their audi to yall,btohqsg
but my poly friends that recently graduated had no ceremony at all  receive digital cert and get mailed physical cert only,btohqsg
moe gonna make everyone create Minecraft accounts,btohqsg
So eat the big one mah,btohqsg
ya imagine one whole class in survival mode,btohqsg
would be nice if someone spons me rtx2080ti ðŸ˜˜,btohqsg
During my ~sleep~ vigorous maths session,btohqsg
Well she got balls to do that,btohqsg
There are 2 amdk in the group now,btohqsg
No one when everyone is indeed shady,btohqsg
Shady is a frame of mind,btohqsg
You speak like the real John Smith too,btohqsg
how do you know he isnt the real john smith,btohqsg
As i said  its a frame of mind,btohqsg
Eventually an owner tag would appear beside my name,btohqsg
That is only a matter of time,btohqsg
This statement is thus a priori,btohqsg
You imposter  Iâ€™m the real deal,btohqsg
I have both your numbers saved  so I can't tell what TF is going on,btohqsg
U have john smiths number saved,btohqsg
