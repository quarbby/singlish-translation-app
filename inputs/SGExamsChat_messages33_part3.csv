one of the few exceptional ones,btohqsg
The script legit is very good,btohqsg
I like the sg history trilogy too,btohqsg
Not now now but now as in this period,btohqsg
I like the first one oni,btohqsg
Old ppl time in the chat woop,btohqsg
Like that bastard that killed his brother,btohqsg
I HATE THAT GEN 1 THAT IS STILL NARRATIVELY ALIVE IN S3 JUST DISAPPEARED. NEVER CAMEO  NEVER DIE.,btohqsg
well u need to rmb that sg scriptwriters only have 20 episodes to flaunt their talents,btohqsg
Then they should have written out the remaining Gen 1 out of the narrative by S2  they chose not to.,btohqsg
I like the movies long long time ago,btohqsg
The actress hugged my doggo once,btohqsg
Lol I never meet there actors before sia,btohqsg
Stay in SG so long le,btohqsg
How people run into them at grocery stores is beyond me,btohqsg
She friend of my aunt das why,btohqsg
Ur Aunt got some zai network,btohqsg
Bc less crowd = slower rate pf transmission,btohqsg
aileen tan is the only one i know abt lolol maybe they just close becos of sth else,btohqsg
Except the crowds gather outside the mall,btohqsg
Bc if you infect people you infect less thanif it were crowded,btohqsg
That’s the flaw with the plan,btohqsg
I wanna stay home and mug,btohqsg
"""Haha kids will go out and play all day anyway""",btohqsg
And expect kids to stay home?,btohqsg
Anyone agree with the no sick no mask policy,btohqsg
Likely there will be ppl going out,btohqsg
I don’t usually agree with our Govt but this I agree,btohqsg
But that is incomparable to forcing every one of them to go out every day,btohqsg
Its mainly to ensure sg has enough mask for medical professionals,btohqsg
Honestly even if I don't I also need to agree Cox I not enough masks HAHA,btohqsg
So basically is just resource allocation la,btohqsg
Also if they want go out and heck care studies i say let the bell curve be carried forth,btohqsg
But I heard got this new mask where u can reuse it,btohqsg
If we can print mask like nobody,btohqsg
Then I think gov won't care,btohqsg
like u just cut your mask into 6 pieces,btohqsg
Pull down that bellcurve for me baby,btohqsg
Anyway cambridge is marking leniently this year,btohqsg
And then u slot it in some mask that has a air hole thing in between I can't rmb but straits times got report,btohqsg
Erm if they get yeeted out of the game of life  they don’t exist on the curve,btohqsg
Mark lenient means everyone higher mark,btohqsg
Means u same grade as if they don't lenient,btohqsg
Ugh I hate this misconception that young ppl are safe,btohqsg
I need to ace the interview,btohqsg
U know the qn b4hand meh,btohqsg
Which i might considering I have the passion for med,btohqsg
It is equally logical that they don’t mark any more or less strictly,btohqsg
If u good enough u can spin any question into a favourable one,btohqsg
That sounds like dodging the question to me,btohqsg
