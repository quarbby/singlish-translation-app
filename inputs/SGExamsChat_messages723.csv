I actually didnt look at it oops,btohqsg
Reclassify as BDE and S/U it,btohqsg
It will go under U for your quota,btohqsg
And then u can choose another mod,btohqsg
We can't do that if it is a core tho.,btohqsg
Eh idk but he always wears white t shirt,btohqsg

Can I just use my student one?,btohqsg
nah they need to give access to the card for specific rooms,btohqsg
Idk i felt like i didnt exactly understand what iam learning completely... only reason why i got my marks even was because i remembered bits and pieces of the workings + copied them on my chestsheet lmao,btohqsg
mine has access only to my office and 24/7 to the spms building ig,btohqsg
SHHK is literally just offices and non of them are locked,btohqsg
We just use them as a link way,btohqsg
Go in take lift turn left turn left turn right go straight turn left,btohqsg

HOHOHOHOHO no. april FOOLS because at least 5 of my annotated lecture notes just decided to grow legs and run away from my ipad. like bro was gone  legit ate and left no crumbs ( no traces of it in my recent deletes  on my ipad and others )AND THE MOST INFURIATING PART ISN'T EVEN THAT MY NOTES ARE GONE ( maybe it is ) its because of the fact that in WEEKS BEFORE this tragic  life-threatening and shitting myself event I NOTICED THAT MY PREVIOUS FUCKING ANNOTATED NOTES WERE GONE and I was like oh maybe I am just that retarded that I accidentally deleted it and DELUDED MYSELF INTO RE-ANNOTATING A NEW SET FOR IT TO FUCKING DISAPPEARA AGAINgg apple  refund me my $1.25 for ur shitty serviceedit : just found out the definition of ate and left no crumbs,btohqsg
"bro really said ""ate and left no crumbs""",btohqsg

then got foolscap that is just the hexagons,btohqsg
Basically it's to show the shape of the bonds,btohqsg
A level we don't need use,btohqsg
If it proves the pt can alrd 🫡,btohqsg
dude i believe if i post the incident on reddit the sch is definitely screwed,btohqsg
but acjc alr has too much tea gg on,btohqsg
cos currently only my classmates and I know abt it,btohqsg
but in all levels  IT'S WRONG,btohqsg
I can't tell if it's stupid,btohqsg
don't care also cannot do that type of shit bro,btohqsg
she even repeated it in front of the same witnesses,btohqsg
im not the type of person who would immediately report to the police but if it gets too serious  i have to report liao,btohqsg
like if she doesn't care  i understand,btohqsg
but you have to give WARNING,btohqsg
ngl started org chem and QA was more annoying so far,btohqsg
i don't have concrete evidence anyway,btohqsg
defo not touching chem in jc,btohqsg
For those who wants better jawlines bahahah,btohqsg
reporting to police is useless if they only issue warning to the sch,btohqsg
but pls don't say for now,btohqsg
what the hell is gg on,btohqsg
bro they're prob more scared than me,btohqsg
u can say all this but not drop any tea??,btohqsg
would like it to be private now,btohqsg
If she doesn’t want share then don’t push her I guess,btohqsg
if it gets worse  just report to police,btohqsg
u saying it to 2k ppl,btohqsg
Ok I understand I respect your decision,btohqsg
cos it's still too early to tell,btohqsg
but im not saying exactly what happened,btohqsg
But are you feelin alright now or,btohqsg
i just believe it's not right at all,btohqsg
im fine lol  im just worried if it happens again,btohqsg
But FR tho if it happens again...,btohqsg
Then just be careful I guess idk what’s the context but now sure you are surrounded by people that cares about you whom you can trust,btohqsg
Speak to a counsellor or even your parents,btohqsg
The sch is gnna prioritise their rep over the students in many cases esp if theres no evidence,btohqsg
if it happens to my peers  it's definitely not an accident alr,btohqsg
They will only rly care if its really bad,btohqsg
You don’t need to bottle all things in and they can be use assurance,btohqsg
usually police will be responsive on sim cases as this incident,btohqsg
Stay safe js know you are not alone and you can reach out for help,btohqsg
hr cares about the company not u,btohqsg
A police report usually takes weeks or even months,btohqsg
my friends all believe that what she did was wrong,btohqsg
So ya and you need like concrete evidence,btohqsg
Best if you have recordings and footage,btohqsg
thing is:1. i have no concrete evidence2. it's still too early to tell,btohqsg
Hope Ur class stay safe frfr,btohqsg
im just worried it happens again. personally  I'm fine but i really distrust her now,btohqsg
and if it happens to my peers  it's gonna be BIG,btohqsg
Trust issues is bound to happen what is important is how you take this incident and learn from it,btohqsg
To prevent another incident from happening,btohqsg
Make sure when interacting w that person no one on one la,btohqsg
but why would this mf do it IN PUBLIC,btohqsg
Idk maybe you can ask someone your really trust to keep a lookout but discreetly so you can catch the person red handed,btohqsg
yeah  the stupid thing victims do after these cases is to SPREAD IT ON REDDIT. REDDIT OUT OF ALL PLACES???,btohqsg
it really depends on the context. some (even less serious) stuff has IOs contact the reporter within hours lol,btohqsg
Was there like any grudges between you and the person,btohqsg
ok im gonna do some work first  see yall,btohqsg
