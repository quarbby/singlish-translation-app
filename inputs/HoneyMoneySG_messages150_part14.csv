Assuming Aug to Oct is not the first quarter month  have you spent $500 on ELIGIBLE transactions on each month (Aug  Sep and Oct)?,btohqsg
Oh yes  found 1 statement which has the rebate.  Seems lots of criteria to be fulfilled.  Many thks for the advice.  👍,btohqsg
There's not a lot of criteria to fulfill. Just spend $500 on ELIGIBLE transactions in 3 CONSECUTIVE months based on your STATEMENT quarter.,btohqsg
I got$100 credit from dbs altitude for Nov spent and reflected to my Dec statement  but they not use the credit to minus the credit card balance in Dec and Jan. anyone have the same experience?,btohqsg
Hi all  just want to check whether I will earn 4MPD using my Amaze x Citi rewards to pay for Anytime Fitness  does anyone have experience? Can’t seem to find online. Thanks!,btohqsg
Just realised uob deducted 6500Points from me in Feb 2024 for a card that I don’t use. It’s almost a year. Any chance to ask for waiver? Haha,btohqsg
Too late now. Its almost a year.,btohqsg
Ya I used the chat bot and looks like they can consider if it’s within 3 months. 6500 is more than 10k miles. Because points were deducted and I didn’t see any $ outstanding since I don’t use the card and missed that deduction unless you click on the card to see the transaction,btohqsg
Eligible FD  SG bonds  eligible SG stocks etc.,btohqsg
Hi all  looking to change from UOB One Account to OCBC 360 Account  currently using UOB One as my credit card  anybody have any recommendation for the best credit card paired with OCBC 360? I’m open to cashback or miles card,btohqsg
ocbc rewards for 4mpd/6mpd on whitelisted MCCs,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/jJSYE4lPIGMCheck this and see anything fits,btohqsg
Hi Sifu's  Im sorry.. this question is not finance/cards related but I hope I can get help from you guys.My hdb will undergo HiP this year but no confirmation date yet. I have alrdy booked a trip in Sep. What happen if the HiP clash with my trip? Can it be postponed?,btohqsg
Talk to HIP officer and check with them.,btohqsg
Hi for those who RSTU via giro  how long does it take for the amt to be credited to your CPF SA?,btohqsg
Hi guysI need help here yesterday I made a payment for my Citi credit statement including any pending transaction reflect on the appE.g statement:620Pending transaction: 30After I paid all I expect my credit limit back but it shows extra ->99 <- ????I called Citi bank they said any transection that is not confirmed will not pose on the statement but it will still reflect on the app as pending isn't?,btohqsg
pending transaction will only be reflected on statement if posted (few days after transaction),btohqsg
when is ur statement date and payment due date? Why in a hurry to make payment and have credit limit back?,btohqsg
yes when I paid I also included the pending amount but how come Citi shows that I still own then money o.o,btohqsg
For the UOB Stash Account  the interest is credited monthly ? To earn the max interest of 5%  the requirement is incremental or maintain current balance. If I maintain the stash account balance of 100k  it will meet the 5% interest?,btohqsg
it normally generate on the 19 of every month  i normally paid the statement together with any pending transaction to start a new,btohqsg
When did you pay? It takes time for Citi side to register and update.,btohqsg
what u meant by -> 99 <- ????,btohqsg
Sorry please censor ur cc number,btohqsg
Only same bank transfer is immediate to increase back the cc limit  all other bank transfer to card will take time to reflect.,btohqsg
Ur payment is pending. It will update in 1-2 days,btohqsg
yes but y after I paid the statement together with the pending transaction they shows that I got an outstanding of 99😢 ??,btohqsg
the pending amount doesn't telly....I called the bank the lady seem to be pushing around T^T,btohqsg
To clock the $500 would be your target for ocbc. From the hmsg video you can see some tips. Just note that paying for none cashback or miles earning category will also be counted for the $500 spent hence it be helpful for your planning.,btohqsg
Right isn't it supposed to be credit limit back to 100% after (fast trsf) ? In the previous payment I did this with credit limit instantly returned to 100% after payment but not this time 😱plus the pending isn't match what is shows in my account 😕,btohqsg
i am new to this miles thing  may i know how long does citibank points convert to kris+ miles takes ?,btohqsg
Citibank to kris + should be immediate but value is bad.,btohqsg
Usually it’s not instant. interbank transfer for bill payments also take abt 2 days to clear. Anyway if u’r in urgent need for credit limit  can always call in to ask for temporary credit limit increase,btohqsg
value as in 1 point to 1 mile?,btohqsg
Same bank mean citibank acct to citibank card.,btohqsg
U can go see other fintuber video on converting kris + miles using citibank point,btohqsg
To OCBC 360 users  Can I check if just crediting my salary and not touching it  does it allow me to earn the “save” interest.,btohqsg
Need to be 500 mab more compare to late month balancr,btohqsg
For example I have 75k in the account now. My salary comes in at 3k and I do not touch it every month. Technically I “saved” $500 so my mab will keep increasing. So does it counts?,btohqsg
Unless ur salary come in first day bah. Mab is abit tough to track so ppl just manually add. Plus all the public holiday thingy etc,btohqsg
Next example I hit 100k in Jan. and 150k in June. The excess 50k would be useless so if I transfer the excess 50k out to other account  my mab will become very high right. So what’s the best move here haha,btohqsg
actually any day also can  assuming the salary credited around the same day each month,btohqsg
Pls visit UOB website to understand how the “5%” is calculated for Stash.,btohqsg
The issue is that pay day can change due to ph or weekend etc haha. So safer to just manually put on first day,btohqsg
