you need to step off your high horse. pop and bangs have very different ways of being produced.next time before spewing information  be sure youâ€™re on the right page before being aggressive to EVERYONE,btohqsg
carspotting for them is close enough ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg

They like paying $1 for rides in cars,btohqsg

they think an obnoxiously loud supercar means its the fastest in the world and the owner gets laid everyday,btohqsg
we still on this topic ah ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
I think the only cars that should pop and bang are EVs,btohqsg
