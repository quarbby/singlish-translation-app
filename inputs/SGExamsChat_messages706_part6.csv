RP like shag eh must do RJ madam,btohqsg
Ok from what I've heard it's harder if let's say you're set on transferring sec 2NA to sec 3exp... I mean ngl for me I transferred when I was sec 1 and ngl I must admit I find NA too slow and exp too fast for me,btohqsg
failed because i did not write 20 words,btohqsg
Uhmm RP must do RJ very mafan,btohqsg
lol this i rmb being shown this a lot,btohqsg
NP good uh like facilities and environment,btohqsg
But is RJ a big component?,btohqsg
Overall which poly yall think is the best concussive environment,btohqsg
i honestly think the only selling point of rp is the ease of progress,btohqsg
no shit  cause they need ppl,btohqsg
which is not a selling point tbh,btohqsg
literally 1/2 the classes in my school are empty,btohqsg
Like got give opportunity to go overseas and all?,btohqsg
like its figuratively easier to get a higher gpa depending on how you learn,btohqsg
you can be a gpa 1.8 in one sem and a gpa of 2.6 in the next,btohqsg
"""plagarism score"" is there for a reason",btohqsg
the most wtf part is..you barely pass all your 5 main modules  your gpa 1.4,btohqsg
Your campus is already the smallest,btohqsg
And yâ€™all still are so empty,btohqsg
how did she catch up w the sec 1-3 NA stuff sia,btohqsg
i did not know you could fail rj lolz,btohqsg
The food nice not and the lectures helpful?,btohqsg
now i know you can only fail specific rjs,btohqsg
Cause big jump for me I heard poly different ocean from ITE,btohqsg
ITE east is so far east,btohqsg
"3 canteens  1 cafe  1 starbucks all within premises of rp.food average around 4-6  a few good stalls  lecturers are ""partimers""...""cant contact after 6""  ""dont reply to msteams/outlook during non schooling hrs""",btohqsg
no it actually is  majority of lecturers are literally on the clock/off the job kind of attitude. admin things also take forever because nobody wants to work overtime,btohqsg
i have classmates that been in rp for 5 years,btohqsg
5 yrs and still haven't reach y3 poly yet,btohqsg
Hmm I thought central the bets ITE,btohqsg
I see got Sheng shiong all,btohqsg
Can literally buy crab home to eat,btohqsg
just curious  do poly allow visitors?,btohqsg
West so small and always crowded,btohqsg
no rp student..tell me he purposely fail modules he know he cant do well and take other modules first..since rp got rid of the gpa cap for remodding modules,btohqsg
I wanted to go central but got rejected,btohqsg
last time in rp..if you remod  you get A..your result reflected for gpa would be Maximum B..now they got rid of it,btohqsg
True but no one actually eats there,btohqsg
They all go matrix or eco,btohqsg
so now  anybody in rp can constantly remod until they get their desired gpa,btohqsg
only criteria is you can't remod if you never fail,btohqsg
Is poly GPa the same as they grade ITE?,btohqsg
bruh i got cohort mates going to y2 sem 2 with gpa of 0.9,btohqsg
keep in mind passing all 5 main modules  your gpa is 1.4,btohqsg
going into y2 sem 1  there was a 1.1 and 0.9,btohqsg
How about SP and TP how is it like,btohqsg
And how many mods must you take in poly,btohqsg
you need to pay a fine for dropping out  so most ppl just let the school kick them out. but that also has a criteria,btohqsg
fail 2 modules 2 sem in a row.or fail 1 module 3 sem in a row,btohqsg
Man oh man ok I will think about it after I enroll in army,btohqsg
