Should be ok. Tracking can be a bit wonky so just treat that as bonus if can get.,btohqsg
Hi will I get cashback if I use family and friends Maybank on hawker?,btohqsg
Idk bro I'm thinking to link cc to union pay.,btohqsg

Many cards may not accept school fee as qualifying spend,btohqsg
ahh exclusions apply to $500 qualifying as well?,btohqsg
Should check singsaver terms and conditions,btohqsg

Hi people  is there a way to check how many rewards points for each transaction for Citi Rewards card?,btohqsg
Use Excel to track against the total amount shown on app.,btohqsg
Good Morning anyone  does anyone have any idea what happen to Spore REITs investments now  it suddenly bumped up  my loss from 5k has become green now.,btohqsg
Is there any fees on either end if transfer sgd from dbstoibkr?,btohqsg
Is there going to be Spontaneous Escapes this month?,btohqsg
Nope  provided you're transferring to their Singapore account,btohqsg
Possibly later part of the month,btohqsg
Would MariBank credit card pair with insta be a better deal with 3 percent overseas spend?,btohqsg
Hi all  which credit card would you use to sign up for a conference? Any card which award miles?,btohqsg
Those are usually ex right. Whats payment mode? Online? And how much? I think cards with good signup bonus are decent.,btohqsg
Amount? If below 1.5k then dbs wwmc else look for signup bonus.,btohqsg
Thanks a lot! Yea below 1.5k. Just to confirm that Citi rewards and DBS altitude won‚Äôt work ya? Couldn‚Äôt find the mcc in heymax,btohqsg
Citi rewards could work if mcc isn't travel. DBS Altitude should work too but less mpd,btohqsg
Hi guys can I check for Citi Rewards card  if I were to buy a MacBook Air and pay in installment  does it add into the $1 000 per month spending cap month by month?,btohqsg
It doesn't and also gives no rewards,btohqsg
Alright  but if I buy it one shot then it would be considered?,btohqsg
"Yes correct. Though careful some people claim apple store purchase is not ""online"" for Citi.",btohqsg
hi! has anyone applied for a UOB supplementary card recently?1. how soon does the supplementary holder receive an email to complete their application?2. if i applied for uob visa signature / uob vs does the supplementary card spending subject to 4mpd for eligible txns?,btohqsg
Oh okay thank you so much for the heads up!,btohqsg
1. Usually instant2. not sure what you mean but yes they get 4mpd for eligible transactinos,btohqsg
Seems like the safer alternative is just to use the Amaze Card option haha.,btohqsg
Ya but that will hit u with 1% above 1k  which your MacBook Air likely is. I think you better paywave with something like UOB VS (min 1k and max 2k) at the store.,btohqsg
Oh UOB what card ah Anthony?Sorry there‚Äôs just so many cards out in the market :‚Äô),btohqsg
Will the reason be that they pay with Apple Pay rather than input mcc and good through date? Apple Pay is quite easy to trigger if you‚Äôre using Apple devices.,btohqsg
yes they have a citibank singapore account which they will give you when you tell them you are going to transfer money,btohqsg
I am confused by this question.,btohqsg
if you tell IBKR that you want to deposit xx amount of SGD ( I highly suggest you do  easier to track in case of any issues)  they will provide you bank transfer details. These should be the citibank details in SG. Transfer to this account is free for you,btohqsg
Yes. Stating the amount you transferring is faster. I ever state wrong amount but they still will update. Just takes longer to verify,btohqsg
Most important when u transfer from sg bank. Must put IBKR account number and name in comment,btohqsg
Is Trust cash back card the best card for overseas spending with good exchange rate and cash back ?,btohqsg
For general spend and chosen category yes.Some other cards with high rewards can still win trust cashback,btohqsg
ah yes remember to put the correct reference they state in the comments. the name part might not fit but that is fine,btohqsg
With amaze Uob kf dead. Now if buy $20k bag for example. Trust cashback might be decent at 0.2% net benefit.,btohqsg
Odd. Did u log in mobile phone? Try with web browser on laptop maybe. I can see my saving accounts on laptop.,btohqsg
Is this really 3 to 4 months? Got anyone here exp earlier?,btohqsg
Around there when i did last year.,btohqsg
Hi any mighty mind know about the SIA spontaneous escape for October is it not happening?,btohqsg
Thanks. Im expecting at least 2mos,btohqsg
