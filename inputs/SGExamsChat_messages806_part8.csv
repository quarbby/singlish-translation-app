I've also seen pax getting away with oversized cabin baggage the size of a checked bag... and the IFS giving cabin crew a earful for letting the passenger get on board with the bag,btohqsg
Worst thing that can happen is they make you check it... for a fee,btohqsg
the bag literally took up an entire overhead bin,btohqsg
SQ does have baggage allowance for every ticket though  so if you haven't already checked 20kg you probably won't be asked to pay,btohqsg
Also pain in the ass doing banking/adult stuff idk wat im doingðŸ’€,btohqsg
The lesson is  budget may not be budget once you add in all the other fees. Which is why I say SQ is often cheaper than budget.,btohqsg
U talking about the airline or yourself?,btohqsg
I prefer scoot  but merely because I trust SIAEC more than I trust other MROs,btohqsg
Oso whr did u comr from tf,btohqsg
So many Virgins  which one? Virgin Atlantic? Virgin Australia?,btohqsg
Whr u see all these post lol,btohqsg
Yall fly passenger for what. Waste time I just FedEx myself to the destination I want. Saves so much money,btohqsg
I trust fellow Singaporeans not to leave a screw loose in the aircraft I fly,btohqsg
U sure it is not just some Bangala worker they subcontractor out to fix your aircraft,btohqsg
They still have to meet CAAS SAR Part 145 regulations. I'm good,btohqsg
Simi lanpa regulations the only SAR we have is the SAR 21,btohqsg
We also have the Singapore Airworthiness Regulations  SAR,btohqsg
"Coincidentally  there is also a SAR Part 21  ""Certification of Products and Articles and of Design and Production Organisations""",btohqsg
No  as long as you are talking about CAAS and not SAF,btohqsg
Some think they can outsmart me.. maybe... maybe I have yet to see one who can outsmart bullet.,btohqsg
with a bullet hole an aircraft will not be airworthy.,btohqsg
Wdym I can just put some duct tape on that,btohqsg
Sure  you can be the pilot and sole occupant of that flight. Good as new!,btohqsg
The entire SAF is held on with duct tape. If it fixes an entire military I see no issue with fixing just 1 small dinky plane,btohqsg
I find your lack of faith in the SAF most concerning. In fact  the SAF is a bunch of conscripts held together by regulars  not duct tape. Hormat SAF!,btohqsg
Oh  and don't forget the Enlistment Act ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Definitely is bangla  govt says must be cheaper better faster,btohqsg

God damn it  ok for the 10000x i feel like ranting about oldest child problem,btohqsg
But welps i cant turn back the clock to be the youngest,btohqsg
Back then they did not give me any assurance that if i do studies overseas  they will come along,btohqsg
Then now be like â€˜if (my bro and sis) go uk  (they) will consider renting an apartment thereâ€™,btohqsg
Just becoz both of them are going uni at the same time,btohqsg
Tbh they are not on track of getting a scholarship so hahahaha boo boo to their plane,btohqsg
What if i too am poor dad poor son,btohqsg
Idk talking to my parents about my issues sometimes is the worst decision made coz it makes me feel worst,btohqsg
They need to think what is the cause of me listening to my friends more,btohqsg
Instead of complaining that i listen to my friends more,btohqsg
"Some folks are born made to wave the flagHoo  they're red  white and blueAnd when the band plays ""Hail to the chief""Ooh  they point the cannon at you  LordIt ain't me  it ain't meI ain't no senator's son  sonIt ain't me  it ain't meI ain't no furtunate one  no",btohqsg
Do u get the set or do u just choose ala carte,btohqsg
I like their quail eggs ngl,btohqsg
Idk what are my parents thinking,btohqsg
That im the selfish one that salty they went london during my A lvl prep time,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/ZWijx_AgPiA?si=rtd5t2iOMGcKGmJ415 second sin and you will understand,btohqsg
When they hv big balls to talk abt it in front of me,btohqsg
Omo ofc they dun owe me anything to make them change or whatever  but stillðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I mean i cannot do anything to change others,btohqsg
Please consult your doctor or local medical professional if you have enlarged testicles,btohqsg
What i can do is to accept their biasness nd favouritism towards my siblings,btohqsg
