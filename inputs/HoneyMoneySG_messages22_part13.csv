I read the clause for the above. No mention on petrol under non eligible spend,btohqsg
Any idea as I may be wrong,btohqsg
Maybe best to use amaze>CRMC combo for 10x rewards,btohqsg
Telco like also not under exclusion list of uob krisflyer,btohqsg
For those using citi rewards card  based on the max 9000 citi points that I can get from 1 month‚Äôs worth of spending  if I wanted to exchange those points for cash rebate  how much would that translate to?,btohqsg
May I ask what would the best way to convert credit card points to krisflyer miles? I followed Chris videos to hold (and gathered points for) citi rewards  DBS WW  UOB lady Solitare and HSBC,btohqsg
If u can stick to points pooling banks then Hit the 4mpd,btohqsg
What do you mean by stick to points pooling banks?,btohqsg
Hmm I don't see why cards for self employed will be any different from cards from full time employees. But if you have company registration with ACRA you can apply for the Amex Highflyer card,btohqsg
Merry Christmas people!Been trying out the tip to use Liquidpay and link my ocbc 365 card to make payment. Been careful to observe that there‚Äôs the liquidpay logo below the QR before scanning. But sometimes I get errors and cannot make payments. Sometimes okay for other places.Is this normal?,btohqsg
Am I right to say even though exchanging points to cash rebate is much less than miles 'cash back'  this amount is still better than citi cashback+ card of 1.6%? Not sure if I did the math correctly,btohqsg
No problem for me  until I face this issue once yesterday :(Will try again later for my hawker food.,btohqsg
Generally can use LiquidPay if there is the LiquidPay or xnap logo on the QR code,btohqsg
I thought so too  and I made sure there‚Äôs the liquidpay logo  but payments through some stalls with the logo doesn‚Äôt get through ugh,btohqsg
yea. it‚Äôs a hit and miss for myself too.,btohqsg
Yes with 10x points  this translates to 2.27%,btohqsg
I've had no problems with LiquidPay so far,btohqsg
Yes much better than ShopBack pay which is sometimes the QR code is not recognised,btohqsg
May I know if I blind my uob Evol card with Fairprice app to make payments. Does it consider mobile payment or contact less payment or others?,btohqsg
you can link your fairprice app to google pay which would be considered mobile,btohqsg
not too sure about apple phones,btohqsg
Hi gurus  for the Maybank plat card.. minimum spending of 300 based on monthly statement or based on the actual 30 days spend.. e.g. 01 dec to 31 dec,btohqsg
Just saw ur post  sinopec is selling TNG enchanted at the price of $15. If u cannot wait just go for it.. really convenient,btohqsg
But not sure still got stock not.. as I bought it like a month ago.,btohqsg
Oh ya  how much does it take for HSBC revolution card to be approved and send over? Think already more than a week,btohqsg
Watson TNG got expiry date? I have 1 bought in jb,btohqsg
for me 1 day approve  and took about 5 days the card reach me,btohqsg
For big ticket items like hospital bills more than 6k  I'm guessing citi rewards not the ideal card due to 1k max rewards. Is the Citi premier miles the next best option? Since hospital bill can't spilt and I don't like instalment.,btohqsg
U know u overspend when u reach the limits 4pmd for several credit cards üòÇ,btohqsg
Do hospital bills earn miles also? No exclusion list?,btohqsg
I just use Amex TCb cuz guarantee got CB,btohqsg
hmm  that should be online also mah.,btohqsg
Im under the impression that any transaction via gpay would be under mobile. Of course i could be wrong,btohqsg
So means fairprice app is online payment too?,btohqsg
As in I link my card to fairprice app,btohqsg
may I ask  did u apply via hsbc app or website?,btohqsg
through the money smart  along the line,btohqsg
If I top up big pay  using credit card   can it be withdrawn?Bigpay > Grab wallet > bank correct?,btohqsg
did u apply via hsbc app or website?,btohqsg
bigpay to grab to your paynow account registered with same mobile number as grab,btohqsg
hi guys  i am confused. dbs live fresh 600 sgd excludes medical fee? if i payWave in a clinic  can this be counted as eligible spend?,btohqsg
It happened to me ystd ugh üòÇ,btohqsg
Public hospital should be no  but private hospital like thomson medical should have?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still getting error to payment request with both amaze and hsbc cards  with different store vendor. Anyone can advise please?,btohqsg
i applied thru website too using singpass but then after 2 weeks no news i itchyhand go & try again via their app   then suddenly i got an email saying ‚Äùwe are unable to approve your application at this time‚Äù so i thjnk better for u to wait a while or just call them ü§£i guess for my situation they recorded it as multiple credit card application? i‚Äôm going to call them on tues to check again,btohqsg
medical fee not excluded from the $600 minimum spend. Hospital and govt service MCCs excluded from the paywave 5%  clinic likely not excluded,btohqsg
Need advice - for msia spending prefer to use youtrip or amaze?,btohqsg
Amaze paired with CRMC/maybank family and friends,btohqsg
Anyone using sc smart cc? Seems good. No annual fee  and 6% cashback,btohqsg
I have that card for the reason that it has no annual fee. I am not a fast food fan and travel in trains so much I have the concession pass  the Bus/MRT might be of little use. Otherwise  I'd say why not?If you have the X Card or Infinite Card  you even get to redeem SQ miles at a better rate.,btohqsg
