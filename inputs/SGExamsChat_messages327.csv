Neil is back to KO bedok,btohqsg
The JC teachers will start to apply an increasing resultant force  such that the pace of studies accelerate at an increasing rate.Eventually  they will feel the resistance of the students  and when the resistance of the students equal to the force applied by the teachers  the resultant force becomes zero and studies will reach an equilibrium point.,btohqsg
what is this abuse of power !,btohqsg
that equilibrium pt thingy is reminding me of econs,btohqsg
and I didn’t want to take econs….,btohqsg
Literature my love  where are you,btohqsg
then you have to consider the opportunity cost,btohqsg
the school considered that and still gave me econs,btohqsg
but love for econs not mutual,btohqsg
Econs is most applicable to after graduation life  trust me,btohqsg
yes it’s interesting but it doesn’t like me right now,btohqsg
I need to slowly fix our relationship,btohqsg
econs is mostly never a mutual love,btohqsg
omg Neil is just going for it,btohqsg
My story: my econs score went from C to D to E (because Econs start with E)Then went back to B by prelims after massive 3 months self study effort.,btohqsg
Only 1 grade matters  the A level grade,btohqsg
