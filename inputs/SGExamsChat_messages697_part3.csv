Guys just a qn  before EJC was established  where do IP students from schools like Cat High/SNGS/SCGS go to for JC?,btohqsg
i know most SCGS would proceed on to HCI,btohqsg
So they get to choose any JC they want or is it based off their Y4 results ( so basically mini o level ),btohqsg
it should be just... O level?,btohqsg
But IP don’t take o lvl what,btohqsg
No all ip schools are tag to a Jc  I think those 3 schools have recently added ip tracks and that is where EJC came about,btohqsg
eh wait I read the question wrongly  then I did a quick search  seems like kiasuparents may have the answer,btohqsg
Hmm yeah it seems that in 2013 they introduced ejc and Ip track simultaneously  but then wasn’t ejc like a 10+ COP sch ? Wldnt that cause a lot of dispute considering SNGS Cat high SCGS PSLE cop is 250+ for IP?,btohqsg
