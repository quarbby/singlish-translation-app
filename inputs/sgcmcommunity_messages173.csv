hi all  I have a qns regarding my exhaust pipe. current car is 1 tank but I'm looking to do a re route. From the right side tail pipe to the left side in order to install quad pipes. Anyone knows if this is LTA legal?,btohqsg
just wondering if anybody has gone through this before and can advise,btohqsg
in order to do a reroute  do u need to cut something?,btohqsg
If the original muffler never touch it's fine,btohqsg
If you want 6 pipes also nobody cares,btohqsg
But if everything before the tips are still stock then it's pointless,btohqsg
You get 0 extra sound  0 extra performance,btohqsg
Save your money to invest in stocks better,btohqsg
you want to reroute a new pipe to create dual exit where before it was a single side exit. not legal,btohqsg
With enough money and time you can get LTA to approve it,btohqsg
But like I said what's the point?,btohqsg

This weekend car expo and following week COE Oct 2nd bidding,btohqsg
White ants target is the more the better,btohqsg
Ask those car dealer dun bid so high coe . Then the coe will not be so high already,btohqsg
If all the dealer & independent participant bid $1   then coe will be $1?,btohqsg
But those outside of the quota will be buay song n bid higher,btohqsg
Don't forget  COE is won by the lowest bidder in the quota,btohqsg
Then like that is the car dealer to maintain the coe price not the government to make the coe so high .,btohqsg
So imagine the bid the highest bidder put,btohqsg
Anyway hor I always see people indicate government making the coe so high . But turn out is not is others,btohqsg
Like i said  nowadays dealers all making guranteed bid liao,btohqsg
When u buy car  u alrdy prepared for the financial output,btohqsg
Guaranteed coe must add $$$ de,btohqsg
Today tell u car is 150k. U ok means u alrdy prepared for 150k to 170k,btohqsg
Backend they throw u credits  free umbrella  free tinting,btohqsg

We tried grab express but dun have driver,btohqsg
We focused on the wrong stuffs,btohqsg
Nonsense. Insurance got cover non named drivers also,btohqsg
I thought all car insurance covers all,btohqsg
So you jolly well have the coverage lo. If you're letting different people drive your car,btohqsg
Unless maybe you cheap out ah,btohqsg
The cheapo insurance like budget direct don't have,btohqsg
Supposed to work now but I cannot already üòø,btohqsg
If anything happens  the bill scary,btohqsg
And I dun quite trust the car quality. So many ppl using and who knows how they cheong and ram the car,btohqsg
If you go cheap and get third party only then it's just named drivers,btohqsg
Sir yours I think is more than signal light,btohqsg
But why would you cheap out on insurance,btohqsg
You ask@awj_moodgive you list of good getgos,btohqsg
Ehh..I think this one important leh,btohqsg
Can scare people in the mirror if the right colours are chosen,btohqsg

Quite common  normally BMW / Merc is the standard  nowdays Alphard and Velfire also popular,btohqsg
I heard that it suppose to be symbolise propserity and success in the marriage life,btohqsg
It is a chance to sit in a car  you likely will never own.,btohqsg
Last time rented cars very obvious cos plate number start with sha or something,btohqsg
feels nice to be chauffered around in a nice car leh once in a lifetime,btohqsg
but nth wrong with normal cars eh my cousin rented a Honda Civic for her bridal car,btohqsg
Bm or merc too Common lol,btohqsg

My car is a Volkswagen üòÇ,btohqsg

#PSAüì¢ We have released the#COEQuota for Nov 2023 to Jan 2024  which is 13% higher than the last quarter (Aug to Oct 2023).The quota for Category A üöó is 22% higher than the previous quarter  and 81% higher than the same quarter last year  after bringing forward 1 570 guaranteed de-registrations of vehicles on a 5-year renewal.The quota for Category C üõª is 35% higher than the previous quarter and 124% higher than the same quarter last year.,btohqsg
Must see how high the coe climbs,btohqsg
Feel like the prices won‚Äôt change much,btohqsg
Haha i think the coe price gonna climb higher instead,btohqsg
That‚Äôs their plan so more people can drive for grab.,btohqsg
Is it normal for dealerships to want to settle insurance and financing? Any advantage to doing so?,btohqsg
Insurance I dont see why I can't buy myself  bank loan I also can apply for,btohqsg
Also  is there any way to verify odometer (for coe cars)?,btohqsg
Shouldn't car sharing company bid for business coe only,btohqsg
U can apply yrself. No wrong. Just tell salesman,btohqsg
If they quote me same or lower then I dont care,btohqsg
For this can send the car back to AD for checks. But at ur own cost,btohqsg
How would AD verify mileage of a 15yo car though?,btohqsg
Crap  how can compare yoy when fluctuations doesn't reflect actual situation. Bs,btohqsg
But be careful  there are many ways to lower the premium e.g. raising the excess,btohqsg
Good shout. Got to watch out for that.,btohqsg
No insurance and/or bank loan  sellU at higher price,btohqsg
sometimes the insurance or financing can either have more favourable terms than market or can be cheaper. You will need to do your own research to confirm this,btohqsg
I parked at Blk 1091A Lower Delta Road tonight to have dinner at Chuan Kee. I thought I just parked for about two hours  but why I had to pay $5? Anyone can advise? Who can I write to for verification?,btohqsg
Reportedangga sapurede padel af[6161756322] to admins.,btohqsg

I tried once. Full throttle from 0 when traffic light turn green beside the police car. Police car overtakes me and ignore me ü§£,btohqsg

Then got problem ah girl girl,btohqsg
Diesel pick up all good la do stage 1 pick up even better and last longer,btohqsg
But road tax also ver good to gov hahahah,btohqsg
Pickup truck pick up must be good ma,btohqsg
Lol that's why I tell my friends I drive BMW truck hahahah,btohqsg
But tuning potential limited with stock parts... Too much torque can be catastrophic,btohqsg
Waiting for COE to end most likely change to a 2.0CC petrol road tax maybe cheaper a bit,btohqsg
Yes diesel tuning only till stage 1 anything above is risk taking with LTA and TP,btohqsg
Yup.. diesel being diesel  just enjoy your cheap mileage,btohqsg
One of the nice chatter . You dun go disturb him,btohqsg

Anyway  I contributed some as well. When I first bought the car  the said side mirror already had some issue and was brought up to the salesman attention prior.,btohqsg
He said will get it done but did not. I din pursue the matter,btohqsg
So using this chance to change into a brand new one (the thing came with a sealed box from Hyundai),btohqsg
Maybe you would just wanna say out instead of keep asking?,btohqsg

If use native android better 8gb / whichever best,btohqsg
If apple carplay  u wont really interact much  so its fine if u take 2gb  maybe a bit lag but mostly just spotify / waze so its okay,btohqsg
I rather native android than android auto,btohqsg

I think coe just gonna keep flying up man,btohqsg
No leh . Why I power .,btohqsg
Hello all  not sure if this is discussed before. Can anyone share your views w.r.t leasing a car vs owning a car please.Hope to hear good perspectives please. Thank you.,btohqsg
Leasing: can change car every year. No need to worry abt rd tax  inurance,btohqsg
You can do whatever you want with the car also,btohqsg
Easier and better if it was your own car,btohqsg
"My thoughts is that cos we don't really ""own"" our car per se. Might as well lease and end the lease as and when we want it",btohqsg
In spore owning same as leasing,btohqsg
If like that might as well lease hor... At least can change car every leasing term ends.,btohqsg
Hmmm lease u cannot modify the car,btohqsg
If u cannot play y play,btohqsg
Car owning has to be fun,btohqsg
Fun to own and fun to drive,btohqsg
If u have no pref choose lease,btohqsg
For me I like to buy,btohqsg
Precisely. A car is just a tool to bring me from point A to B.,btohqsg
Then leasing is the way for you,btohqsg
No need a lump sum to dp also,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing your perspectives! Appreciate the time to share üòÉ,btohqsg
Of course in an ideal world,btohqsg
Born in this country everything is pap,btohqsg
Ui walk pass c c only......straight turn to toilet,btohqsg
I will lease after my COE ends. Will have this new perspective thereafter. No need to have too much emotions tied to a car.,btohqsg
Had to park there for 3 days for work... Spent like 70 bucks,btohqsg
Ya lo that's y I say crazy,btohqsg
Even if u throw in hybrid I do not think it's worth,btohqsg
A few more years u wont see bnb cars alr. Only luxury,btohqsg
idm  no need house liao  can just stay in car,btohqsg
U got house liao lah broüò∂,btohqsg
seems like general sentiment is COE price is too high and insane.. means likely gonna see drop in demand? drop in demand means COE price will drop?,btohqsg
More maintenance if first owner is shit..,btohqsg
Also roads in sg are increasing (tengah new town  punggol expansion etc) but coe quota is not?,btohqsg
One bus stop so far away,btohqsg
Damn that's how they justify not increasing quota right ü•≥ü•≥,btohqsg
That's my wedding car. Borrow one üòÇ,btohqsg
And grab car and rental cars to go back and forth to new towns,btohqsg
Leasing now costs 2k or more a month.vby a few yrs time it may hit 3k or 4kc amonth to lease a car.,btohqsg
coe up = leasing up also. Cus they alr paying maintenance and road tax. Must cover somehow to maintain profit margin no,btohqsg
So those who Don have lum some cash to down pay 70k 90k for car and loan the balance. Then go leasing lor. Earn 6k pay 2k to lease.,btohqsg
Left 2k to eat and everything else,btohqsg
No ba  got 1k plus but is those coe cars,btohqsg
If u lease an altis 10 years  assume 2k per month is alr 240k. U buy a new one 170k  with interest on 30% dp and then road tax + maintenance  only about 220k (maintenance is 1k per year  w road tax assumption 600/year),btohqsg
For those who got no cash to downplay,btohqsg
But can fork out 1.5k 2k a mth for a car. Then lease is 1 way,btohqsg
This is true  cos when you buy your own  the profit part is out of the monthly expenses equation when compared to leasing,btohqsg
Our assumption is hold car all the way to the end lo,btohqsg
Own car benefit is u still can do lalamove or grab hitch part time,btohqsg
Still cost amount to the same lo,btohqsg
Unless suddenly change to diff car,btohqsg
Prior to buying my Stonic  I was looking to lease a Jimmy,btohqsg
The dealer quoted me no more than 2000km a mth,btohqsg
Ya. But thing is  lease u can every change car regularly,btohqsg
