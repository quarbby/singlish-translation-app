üëçHaha I find it very confusing tho,btohqsg

You can watch my first miles credit card video for the basicshttps://youtu.be/d2ivAKxRnKs,btohqsg

Hi guys  has anyone heard of Chocolate Finance  interest rate looks enticing üßê,btohqsg
Does Citipayall allowed to pay for my internet bills and the data ?,btohqsg
It's not like a bank. Briefly saw their booth at Seedly Personal Finance Fest and from conversation looks abit like an investing tool (didn't ask too much),btohqsg
In their website mentioned regulated by MAS,btohqsg
why not used credit card pay telco directly?,btohqsg
looks like regulated Micro Financer then..my opinion is that even though legit.. the returns are not high enough to justify taking on 'small business risk'put in CIMB at 3.5% p.a. seems way more worth it to me.,btohqsg
There are no guarantees in life. Our portfolio is structured to deliver 4.5% p.a. return on your first S$20k and a target 3.5% p.a. on any amount thereafter. However  If we don't make the target 4.5% p.a. for your first S$20k  we will top up the difference to make sure you enjoy the target return. Does it get any better than that? For amounts above S$20k  we target 3.5% p.a. Your return is a money-weighted rate of return. We advise that 3.5% p.a. is not guaranteed andthere is a potential for capital losses. Past performance is not necessarily an indication of future performance.,btohqsg
looks like they take the money and put into short term bonds and give you 3.5-4.5% and earn the difference.,btohqsg
If like tat might as well take the money and put in money market fund??,btohqsg
The likelihood of fullerton running away is def smaller than them running away,btohqsg
u sure they put your money into bonds? or they take the money and lend out to companies who don't qualify for bank loans?,btohqsg
Pay directly No miles right ?,btohqsg
U are no insured if the company wind up just so u know only bank deposit are sdic protected for first 75k,btohqsg
If u put 100k in uob one won't the extra 25k is not protected?',btohqsg
not sure but from what they described  it's my guess.,btohqsg
yes but its uob so the confidence level is different compared to a new fintech start up.,btohqsg
By right it won‚Äôt happen. The only thing it happen is the collapse of Singapore government,btohqsg
heh heh to me it is a LOSE LOSE situation.If indeed they take your money and buy bond funds  you can do so yourself  WHY PAY THEM?If indeed they take your money and lend to lousy companies  the risk is not worth the returns. WHY DO IT?so TLDR: no to chocolate for me.,btohqsg
i can guarantee you that if you put $100k into UOB and UOB goes bankrupt  you will get back $100k.$500k and above i cannot say with such certainty la.. haha,btohqsg
The money will go straight to the top 20 billionaires,btohqsg
I would like to inform you that no depositor of Credit Suisse has lost a single cent.,btohqsg
Yes. But because it is being bail out. But it did have risk üòÇ,btohqsg
pretty sure if Credit Suisse went bankrupt  their depositors would still not lose a single cent.,btohqsg
Risk Bro. Not happening in the past does not mean futures.,btohqsg
CS bought over by UBS. This include bad debts also.,btohqsg
He mention 0 risk apart Singapore being takeover. . But it does have 0.00000001% risk,btohqsg
0.000000000001% risk sounds lower than putting cash under a pillow,btohqsg
From the back of my mind  without googling  among developed countries  i think only Cyprus Bank depositors ever lost money,btohqsg
Ya. I just anyhow say. But anyway there is a risk too. Just minimums. Good practice of Risk management. Of course only if you really rich then u shld spread out different bank in different countries.,btohqsg
Then yes. Also I think svb  cayman branch depositor money  also all gone.,btohqsg
heh heh.. arguably SVB Cayman is not a developed country bank leh..separate legal entity,btohqsg
Yes. But showcase example of Risk.,btohqsg
You not their citizen. They can just take your money. üòÇ Especially in today context. US and Russia  example.,btohqsg
Yeah man.. i would be wary to put money into funny countries...,btohqsg
Of course all this issue only you are multi-millionaire close to billionaire then u shld worry. We just chat only.,btohqsg
pretty sure if i converted SGD into rubles i would be multi millionaire ü§£,btohqsg
