"""August Is Usually Tough For The S&P 500Going back to 1950  the S&P 500 slipped 0.2% in August on average  says Stock Trader's Almanac. That ranks August as the eleventh-worst month of the year for the index.Andunderperformance in Augustisn't a fluke. It can sometimes come in dead last.""August is the worst ... S&P 500 month during 1988 through 2020 "" says Stock Trader's Almanac. ""In post-election years since 1950  August is still ranked no higher than #11 while average performance slips deeper into negative territory.""More recently  though  August spared S&P 500 investors some of the pain.Last August  for instance  the S&P 500 vaulted 7% higher during the month. It was at that time investors began to anticipate the reopening of the economy. But in just the prior August of 2019  the S&P 500 slipped 1.8%.But not all S&P 500 stocks suffer in August.Technology Is The S&P 500 Place To Be In August""https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/sectors/sp500-august-is-actually-a-great-month-if-you-own-these-8-stocks/",btohqsg
Throw in virus fears  tech might be in focus this month.,btohqsg
Your Morning Quick Read – 3 August 2021The equity market was primarily mixed despite a strong start for the day. A quarter of S&P 500 is set to report their earnings this week. It does not help that bond yields sluggish performance had affected financial stocks given a weaker economic outlook  consistent with our peak growth forecast.Let's get into the details.Equity Weakens with Poor Economic DataThe Dow and S&P 500 were down moderately after giving up the gains in the early trading session. Nasdaq was marginally up by 0.06%. Russell 2000 had a morning glory session  reversing all gains and diving into the red as the trading hours progressed.The US Manufacturing data were weaker than expected  adding pressure to the bond yields and sending stocks lower as investors re-asssess the strength of recovery given the backdrop of the Delta variant looming in investors' minds.The ISM manufacturing survey stood at 59.5 while reflecting a robust expansion phase  which is still short of the expectation of 60.9 and well below the prior reading of 60.6. In other parts of the globe  especially in Europe  where Pika World had initiated the overweight rating on the region  the PMI reading in Europe and the Uk came consistent with estimates. This shows a stark contrast in the recovery phase of both areas.10 Year Treasury YieldIn the bond market  which often fluctuates with the state of the economy  the yield had fallen from1.23% to 1.15%. This reflects an inherent belief of slower growth and lighter inflation ahead by investors.The light July ISM Manufacturing data had to push the 10-Year Treasury Bond to rise sharply  pushing its yield down. Recall that yield tends to fall when bond prices increase  an inverse relationship.Earnings and Fiscal Politics to Support the Market TemporarilyAccording to Credit Suisse  the combined earnings per share beat for S&P 500 has been around 16.2%. The better than expected earnings may provide temporary relief from the peak economic growth narrative to give a floor of support for the market.Also  the infrastructure bill story is cooking once again  and optimism on a re-fuel of economic growth is displayed in the morning trading. As the $1 trillion spending bill is set to pass  job growth prospects bring joy to selected stocks  which we have covered in our Pika World writing.In particular  the cyclical sectors such as industrials and oil producers were leaders in the morning trading session as other stocks took a back seat.What's on the menu today?At 10 pm  we will receive the Factory Order data  which we expect a growth of 1%  a moderation from 1.7% in the prior period.It is 3 August  Tuesday  8.18 am in Singapore and 8.18 pm in New York. It is cool weather  and we hope you will have a fruitful trading week.Take care  stay safe  and we will be right with you for the next update.Cheers Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a larger audience.,btohqsg
