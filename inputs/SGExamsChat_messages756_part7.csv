uhh normally all arts subjects dh?,btohqsg
u penalise for writing things that the marker expects to be there but its not,btohqsg
so for example i had a student who failed her content for GP last time,btohqsg
because she never talk about some examples,btohqsg
that the marker wanted her to talk about,btohqsg
even though the whole essay was sound,btohqsg
yeah thats an example of negative marking,btohqsg
But I feel overall it's need understanding of content also,btohqsg
Can't just vomit and wack and pray ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I always sleep in gp lectures,btohqsg
I only rmb got GP lecture post promos for tm,btohqsg
then the boy just uses phone or talks to his friend,btohqsg
The rest r all tutorial only,btohqsg
After like we get formal timetable,btohqsg
oh Friday gp tutorial I was playing wordle the whole time,btohqsg
GP lecture I only had twice,btohqsg
One is before formal timetable to go thru the exam format or smth,btohqsg
"""Hi guys we shall just not go for lecture and I will explain to the department why""",btohqsg
Then another was to go thru the new qn type,btohqsg
(but it's also kinda useless la tbh),btohqsg
The new item type or smth,btohqsg
idg all this qn type nonsense ngl,btohqsg
From passage 1 blah blah quoteFind smth from other passage that support or contradict the idea,btohqsg
Okay this one bopian need go through,btohqsg

then yall MYE and Promos never test that meh,btohqsg
even YI taught CQ in J1,btohqsg
Like honestly TM GP dept is,btohqsg
It's either rly good Cher or rly shit,btohqsg
At least not teach like MID J2,btohqsg
EJ GP department takes the prize,btohqsg
Uhh its like the qn that asks u to find an idea from another passage and explain whether it undermines or supports,btohqsg
Honestly it felt damn chim at first,btohqsg
Just see if it's same same or diff idea only,btohqsg
U need filter the shit para I guess,btohqsg
that doesnt answer the qn in the first place,btohqsg
Qn: Examine the view that the arts must always be useful to societyReason: The arts must not always be useful to society but in most cases they are,btohqsg
Arts qns tend to be easy,btohqsg
cuz they always revolve around the same things,btohqsg
Actually have i even wrote an arts essay before,btohqsg
i think i did but on specific subsets,btohqsg
i wrote a fashion essay before,btohqsg
