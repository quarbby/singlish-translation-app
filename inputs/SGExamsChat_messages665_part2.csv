the reason why ppl advise you to just tahan if the abuse from parents isnt physical or like harming you (eg. not feeding u) (like provided ur parents feed you  give you food and shelter and school fees  but verbally abuse you)  its best to just wait it out because ur still dependent on them for money,btohqsg
then you can just cut them out of your life once you are financially independent,btohqsg
