ideally spend both cards on the same day to minimise FX difference on different days 👍I'm assuming Amaze and UOB direct card are spent on the same day? I noted even on different times of the day could have slight different in FX,btohqsg
Thank you. Is it  the higher the incremental amount the more returns? Or is the 3 tiers just a cap?,btohqsg

Hi everyone  for self employed person  is the mandatory MA contribution eligible for the CPF cash top up relief when calculating tax?,btohqsg
This table looks confusing.Should the word Holding be at the 3rd column?1st and 2nd columns are the Min and Max deposit?So if I put 50 000 would it be 20 or 40 days?,btohqsg
Not top-up relief  but CPFmandatorycontributions by default arenot taxabletax deductable. Edited for clarity.,btohqsg
I mean I have to mandatory contribute to MA as a self employed  this is not tax deductible  from my earned income right?,btohqsg
Recommendation for prestige cards with good sign up bonus and perks without too high of annual fees like Amex platinum?,btohqsg
I know MA contribution is not taxable because it's not even my earned income in the first place.. I'm asking if it is taxdeductible,btohqsg

You can try 30 Mar.. but if you really want to play safe 28 Mar.. but why 10333.33?,btohqsg
Cause last promo I put in 10333.33 to cover the interest lost lol… I failed my math,btohqsg
If u take out on 28 mar u need to put more for mar as u miss 4 working day  for apr normal 100k on 1 apr is fine,btohqsg
