oh yea anything writing related  the moment the tool switches from blue/black pens to color..it gets real,btohqsg
It is evidence for truth but you can also manipulate truth,btohqsg
There's a book that reconciles stats with math,btohqsg
It's pulling all the weight here u mean,btohqsg
Formal introduction to probability using Borel fields etc.,btohqsg
I've always thought that like  you have to give people the context for stats to make it interesting,btohqsg
what are the odds of pulling a 5*,btohqsg
the interesting part of stats is the applications,btohqsg
suddenly the class sits up straight,btohqsg
i appreciated it more when i started diving into deep learning,btohqsg
"""and therefore the expected value for pulling a 5* is X  but the standard deviation tells us that there is a large 95% confidence interval for when you'll pull one and you should all try to find a well-paying job""",btohqsg
Math says that we shld bealieve that god is real,btohqsg
i mean i use it daily,btohqsg
if i don't enter academia I will probably enter AI / quant,btohqsg
A lot of physics stuff requires some form of computer simulation and coding,btohqsg
yes but like i also look into the algorithms that hedge funds etc use,btohqsg
it's right there at the top of every jupyter notebook,btohqsg
For me  I'd rather join education sector,btohqsg
I definitely cannot handle a job with money,btohqsg
I thought about academia but the advice I got from a lot of profs and reddit is to go private a few years first,btohqsg
quant is looking more and more likely since i value the stability as opposed to academia,btohqsg
I'd love to do that  reallyBut I don't want to get paid like sh*t,btohqsg
it's still a type of research,btohqsg
learn the soft skills and taste the money before you decide to do a PhD,btohqsg
You also considered the profession of teaching / research?,btohqsg
probs depends on the course too,btohqsg
i was kinda encouraged to do some form of science communication. my prof said i'm good at it,btohqsg
I did! ended up in economics and almost did actuarial science,btohqsg
but then I remembered I'm not actually good at the math-y parts of math,btohqsg
I have thought on going to theatre studies before,btohqsg
it's the logic part that I'm better at,btohqsg
Like the nus one  double major in physics and theatre studies,btohqsg
man  if you tried an olympiadwho knows,btohqsg
We need more physicists doing cna documentaries,btohqsg
i'm just chilling until i graduate rn,btohqsg
Like i see myself in science comm more than physics hahaha,btohqsg
and actuary stuff is very competitive  because they prefer to hire pure math majors,btohqsg
Oh s**t it's in 4 days,btohqsg
i think i'm decent at teaching so that's always a backup,btohqsg
i taught my class before actually,btohqsg
like honestly it's not that uncommon to see pure math to quant fin/actuarial science pipeline,btohqsg
i was wyatt's TA in uni lol,btohqsg
Man was shocked he got a B3 and A2 for Pure phy and chem,btohqsg
do we get rich on quant,btohqsg
i'm hoping to nail a perfect raw 6,btohqsg
I did a practical lesson on O level titration for a private sch,btohqsg
the guys with multiple IMO gold medals,btohqsg
i'm talking about the work position like quant is very broad as an industry,btohqsg
slog it out a few years in nyc or london too,btohqsg
did you study local or abroad?,btohqsg
