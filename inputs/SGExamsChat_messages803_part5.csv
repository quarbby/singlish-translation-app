It's not worth imo u only get 6-8 AUs of exemption for 1 year extra,btohqsg
Also u intake at Year 1 too like all of us,btohqsg
depends what subject you get exempted I guess.,btohqsg
If u take it and ace it you can get a higher grade that can up your gpa,btohqsg
I would definitely skip those Engineering Maths,btohqsg
Engineering is a Direct Y2 entry which is different and is an exception to the rule,btohqsg
Even so the learning curve is massive,btohqsg
After i came back sg  i became my sick self again,btohqsg
the weather hasn't been great of late,btohqsg
Maybe will give it a shot and be more disciplined w my vit c  see whether it does anything,btohqsg
Yea if it is too hot  i will get a headache,btohqsg
Everytime I sick I just spam water,btohqsg
Spam my piss and I feel a ok within 8hrs from feeling sick,btohqsg
But i dun feel well practically every day when im in sg,btohqsg
Like i go out for a walk and can barely survive 10-15min,btohqsg
I got a feeling you allergic to something,btohqsg
Mine is not really those kind of symptoms  it is just my body feels weak n tired,btohqsg
the only good time to go for a walk nowadays is early morning or after sundown ngl,btohqsg
even at night it's pushing it if you ask me,btohqsg
Maybe allergic to humidity and sunlight,btohqsg
Yes right even when the sunset it is still so humid,btohqsg
i thought SG COVID rates is off the roof?,btohqsg
the lamp post decides to isekai itself?,btohqsg
It is just in general my body feels weak and im perpetually tired in sg,btohqsg
Why the bus accidents getting more dangerous by the day sia,btohqsg
As in it has all along been like that in sg  but when im overseas  i dun see this problem,btohqsg
This one legit can't even react before your h and gets sliced off,btohqsg
Maybe overworked drivers  the driver tired,btohqsg
the bus driver hit the lamp post?,btohqsg
So it probably has sth got to do w sg being at the equator  v hot n humid all day,btohqsg
Apparently it was a truck carrying steel,btohqsg
And that was not a lampost but a steel cable,btohqsg
you can't move Singapore outside the equator.,btohqsg
But i can move my body,btohqsg
Idk how to curb this problem other than moving out of Singapore,btohqsg
apparently there was a suicide case at bt panjang,btohqsg
maybe stay inside an air conditioned place,btohqsg
And also idk why im perpetually tired in sg,btohqsg
The dr that time gave me bs answer,btohqsg
But i did not tell her the part of the story that im ok and much btr overseas,btohqsg
Apparently she say i need drink isotonic coz low bg and bp…like wth????,btohqsg
i saw the video and dk how the bus did not see the steel thing,btohqsg
Bus underestimated speed of turning truck,btohqsg
woah motorcycle dashcam? feels weird the video aspect ratio,btohqsg
got purposely screen for blood glucose? lol,btohqsg
then the clinic you went is most likely simply diagnosing your problems lol,btohqsg
The weather makes me feel tired also lol,btohqsg
When I’m in winter countries I don’t feel this way,btohqsg
very easily I can fall into an afternoon nap after lunch.,btohqsg
