Lexus first revealed its LFA lookalike EV back in December of last year  but other than the claim that the vehicle will be able to do 0-60 in the mid-2 seconds  little to nothing is known about the vehicle. From what is listed on the Lexus website  the brand states the vehicle may use solid-state batteries and will hope to achieve a range of 430 miles per charge  a number certainly capable of competing with Tesla if released.,btohqsg
