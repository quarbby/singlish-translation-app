If I put money in DBS SRS  how do I declare for tax relief? - Pardon me for my ignorant question if has been asked,btohqsg
Can use master/visa and some say Amex (my Amex failed so I used MasterCard).,btohqsg
don't need to declare  auto submitted for tax relief,btohqsg
Is an excellent question. Your tax relief is what u have contributed for the year. The bank would not let u contribute more than the 'quota'. The bank would transmit your contribution info to iras backend (transparent to u),btohqsg
I just transferred amount to DBS SRS  understand passed cutoff at 7pm but hope no issues,btohqsg
No issue. As long as is before 31 Dec cutoff :),btohqsg
Just saw this but wanted to clarify,btohqsg
Yeah this is also what SRS website mentioned,btohqsg
Most likely won't count le. But hope you still get it,btohqsg
Does this mean can sell the investment after 1 Jan ?,btohqsg

Hi! Was wondering if anyone knows about this :)If let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm using my UOB Lady Card  and I book an accommodation on Airbnb. And I select  pay $350 in December  pay $400 in January. Is it considered a 0% instalment payment plan? Or will I still get 6mpd for both Dec and Jan since I selected the travel category? Thank you!,btohqsg
IPP is provided by bank itself through partnership with the merchant. They will specifically say 0% IPP.,btohqsg
So if it‚Äôs something like this it shouldn‚Äôt be IPP? Because there‚Äôs no bank partnership?,btohqsg
Who using posb everyday card to pay for utilities like Geneco and SP?For bills above $100  are we able pay the excess via AMEX then set recurring to posb everyday?,btohqsg
however  you need to find out how is airbnb helping you to split the cost. Are they using another like BNPL vendor to split  and what's the mcc code for the such transactions.,btohqsg
Ah! I see this makes sense. Sure sure I will find out about it :) thank you!,btohqsg
Yea u should still get it.,btohqsg
Hello  is there any credit card I can apply as an 20 year old? I‚Äôm trading forex and I‚Äôm making low to mid 5 figures monthly for the past 4-5 months. Looking to start building my credit but not sure they will accept ‚Äúforex‚Äù as an source of income,btohqsg
I wanna ask if withdraw need any fees ?,btohqsg
I've a question for stand chart's save up level up promo. If I register in Jan  does it mean I need to empty my bonus saver account on 31 Dec which is tomorrow so that my period end balance on 31 Jan is compared to 0 (which is the period end balance for Dec)?,btohqsg
They won‚Äôt.Even fixed income interest is only taken as build on / reference.U need iras recognised income for credit card credit limit purposes.,btohqsg
Self employed banks may ask for 2 years iras Noa if I‚Äôm not wrong,btohqsg
Anyone know if we can top up SA account for parents age 80+? And how can they withdraw the money?,btohqsg
Wow I did not know that to redeem hsbc miles  we have to sign up for the hsbc mileage programme?Where there is an annual fee of $40?,btohqsg
hey guys  anybody with experience with reward points for hsbc revolution? I got the card on the 22nd of nov  made a transaction of $450 on the 23rd of nov (posted on 24th nov) from easybook  which should qualify for the 9x rewards  so technically by the end of this month i should have more than 4k reward points but i only have 2k+ (im guessing from other transactions) any idea why? Thanks!,btohqsg
yep have to pay $40 for one year unlimited transfer of points,btohqsg
U can do transfer SIA and transfer Cathay to feel better. Sounds like better deal,btohqsg
Update: iChange replied that the code of chong268 is still valid.,btohqsg
A few ideas- Some banks will accept a fixed deposit in lieu of proof of income to secure a credit card- If you‚Äôre serious about forex trading long term  trade through a corporation and use it to pay yourself a steady income,btohqsg
Yup a pte ltd  but there are overhead costs for this option so this requires more commitment,btohqsg
Ohh but this means I wld have to contribute to tax right,btohqsg
Hi hi may I know how to use amaze on Kris+? Amaze cannot be added in iPhone E wallet. Thanks in advance,btohqsg

But... i m not sure if confirm can get it by 02 jan... also... how will they transfer the money back? Is it via paynow or bank transfer?,btohqsg
After redemption the funds will go to your paynow account.,btohqsg
Thanks.... wah like that seems like free money cos u can gain some cashback from UOB absolute card... haha,btohqsg
Yeah it was much better on 29th night.Current promo is also not bad la. But not as good.,btohqsg
Hi! Have a question on cpf top up if anyone can help.In the scenario say if I‚Äôm $3k away from 2024‚Äôs BHS of $71 500  then I top up $8k to my CPF MA on 1 Jan 2024  I supposed only $3k will go into my MA as it hits the BHS ($71500)  and the balance $5k will flow into my SA?In this instance  will my tax relief (for topping up CPF) be $8k next year? (Or will only get $5k as the tax relief)Thank you üôèüèª,btohqsg
Cpf will refund u 5k without interest. So u only get tax exemption for 3k,btohqsg
I see  thanks!Can I top up MA $3k and then top up SA $5k on 1 Jan 2024 instead? To get full $8k tax relief?,btohqsg
How much is 40k citi thankyou points worth?,btohqsg
And what can you redeem with this citi thank you points,btohqsg
16k airmiles  else redeem vouchers from citi's rewards catalogue if you don't fly,btohqsg
U can consider paying insurance from ur MA along the way then top it up back to BHS again,btohqsg
UnderstandGuess i‚Äôll get it done on 1 January  so will split top up $5k to SA and $3k to MA to get $8k relief üòä,btohqsg
