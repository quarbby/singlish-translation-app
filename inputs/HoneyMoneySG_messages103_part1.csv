If it's a refund then usually you'll need to spend the extra on the month you get credited the refund. Check the tracker against your manual tracking would be more accurate.,btohqsg
I wonder where to put the 150K in the whole of June,btohqsg
yes will affect. eg in my case $200 refund so I miss out min spend of 600 as it happen in my final week of calculations  I didnt track and cant spend more in time.,btohqsg
Different. Refunds and fee waivers are separate things. Fees don't count to spending. Fee waivers don't remove from spending.,btohqsg
Hm the CS told me waived amount would not affect. as long as $500 eligible spend  waived amount will only be use to offset,btohqsg
I am using both evol and one so not so direct to check from the app tracker.. anw when does evol rebate come in? started using since last month and have yet to see the cashback,btohqsg
The app's tracker take fromalleligible posted transactions in that calendar month. Doesn't matter you have 1 2 or 3 cards.You already answered yourself  last month you just started using  so the cashback will be this month end.,btohqsg
the amount used will certainly be reflected on your app  the refunded amount will also be offset there properly. evol cashback will give end of next month.,btohqsg
o yes the $500 spend i am not sure exactly how refunds work   as i always hit way over 500 anyways. i only missed my evol card 600 by a little bit once due to the refund.,btohqsg
Thanks cos some cards reflect previous month's cashback at the beginning of next statement month,btohqsg
Can anybody help. I got tiger and webull. Which one gives real-time price for options. I compare both and they give different prices so don't know which one gives real time. Thanks.,btohqsg
To continue on this query  for existing ega users  when do we need to register for the ega promo in order to put 150k in Jun and which will be the reference month? Thanks in advance,btohqsg

Any result for robo advisor so far,btohqsg
If you planned ahead to achieve 150k MAB then no.,btohqsg
Best way to climb on first 100k? As only 23 yrs old,btohqsg
I think UOB cards are having issue. I cannot add UOB card to atome while other cards worked. Similar to uob amaze issue.,btohqsg
Quick question guys.. the interest I received from UOB with 100k is $420.. if I cannot top up 50k by May.. what will be the interest I can get with 100k.,btohqsg
what is the terms and condition of this cashback?,btohqsg
Havenâ€™t read. Just wanted to share 1st to get the news out there,btohqsg
Use excel to calculate MAB and then check against the tiers,btohqsg
Hi Melvyn.. I really don't know how to calculate sia.. so I have to ask.,btohqsg
You can use this as a base:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183200Add in the 50k to whenever you think you will deposit during May.,btohqsg
If you don't top-up the 50k in May then your MAB is 100k  simple as that.,btohqsg
Hi All My Citi Rewards Visa card is expiring soon  Will Citi Bank send me a new card or will force me to change to Citi rewards masterThanks in advance,btohqsg
I didn't receive this email. Seems like only selected users,btohqsg
Like not worth.. I calculated (not sure if I did the right way).. with 100k only get back $286 instead of $400+,btohqsg
Seems like to maximize.. should remain at 100k.. and another 100k for my spouse,btohqsg
Or maybe not... Just 150k in UOB and 50k in Moomoo,btohqsg
Small risk on cash plus I guess...,btohqsg
Yup correct. $286 for $100k  you don't intend to put in $50k somewhere in early May?,btohqsg
Did you include the cash credit from registering for Apr Uob Big Savings Payout promo with 50k incremental fresh funds?,btohqsg
But I don't have so much money to make both UOB account with 150k each cos I got into a bad ponzi scheme 2 years back...,btohqsg
You can try abandoning one of the UOB One accounts from May onwards.First  register the payouts promo by this week for $50k. Then top-up $50k by 30 Apr. This account will have $150k throughout May onwards.You'll get $250 cash credit by end May with earmarked till 16 Aug. This on top of the existing $100k will yield you 4.5% p.a.,btohqsg
whatâ€™s the uob promo that i can register? iâ€™m planning to add the 50k to my account by 1 May for the interest rate changes,btohqsg
Thanks. Is SC e-saver also one of it but i saw that it left one month of 3.45%  just deposit one mth and then move to another account in June   maybe maribank / trust after that?,btohqsg
Hi  For SC e-saver if i will to move my funds out on 1st June then i will still entitled to the May 3.45% on the amount i deposited (fresh funds) this month ?Or if i move out on last day of May it will still be base on the ending daily average amount of May right? Sorry not so familar with all these,btohqsg
Hi  any1 knows if Cold Storage voucher purchase will count towards $800 min spend requirement for DBS yuu 388 sign up offer?,btohqsg
As long as u see it in the app  u qualify,btohqsg
Check if u have it in your app. If I have it u qualify,btohqsg
Checked already  app also don't have ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hi anyone can advise? For SC e-saver if i will only want to get the 3.45% interest  i should not transfer now right as its taking the increamental month average? If i put any funds now it will only take the remaining days of the month for this month interest and more importantly next month i need to put in additional funds and only the additional funds will give me the 3.45% correct?So i should only transfer in 01May? Or 30Apr? How it works. Can anyone advise huh?,btohqsg
I wonder why I see it. I hardly ever spend on Trust other than for overseas spend and that was like more than 6 months ago. Since then I have $0 spending on trust card. Maybe they want to push me to use their cardâ€¦,btohqsg
Hahaha I also donâ€™t use it often  use like once or twice overseas this month nia. Other than that not really,btohqsg
Or the promotion is for Apr and May so it does not compare may vs apr ?,btohqsg
By the way check out the excluded MCC codes. Itâ€™s no Cashback cap so if you have huge purchase  this 1.5% can even fight those unlimited Cashback cards. Anyway  I hope maybe over the next few days they roll out to more users,btohqsg
Seems like the usual excluded mcc. Whats the EIR on the cashback rate? Coz this 1.5% is on top of the link point?,btohqsg
I got it even though I never use Trust bank since day 1 of opening LOL,btohqsg
I think they target those never use de,btohqsg
Haha then does it attract you to use it compared to other cards you have?,btohqsg
