How do you add a CC onto XNAP? The default payment for me is Apple Pay :(,btohqsg
Ahh I see okay thanks! does it work for CRMC?,btohqsg
no  cos crmc excludes online mobile in-app,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows if I can pay AXS with my hsbc revoution card/instaraem+citi rewards and still earn 4mpd spent?,btohqsg
Use second android phone and use google pay  but pay with amaze card with your CRMC card tagged to it.,btohqsg
So AXS negates the relevant MCC?,btohqsg
Hi Guys . If I were to go holiday in KL for 1 weeks. Is it better to use amaze or revolut. Pls advise,btohqsg
u have which mastercard to link with amaze  citi rewards?,btohqsg
I use hsbc revolution   uob preferred visa.,btohqsg
Amaze card only can link master card,btohqsg
So is ocbc titanium rewards ok ?,btohqsg
Wow  congratulations! That‚Äôs a difficult feat. It means you have placed at least 370k for the whole of March 2023 without withdrawing üëçüèª not sure you will get the same for the following month of April 2023 in May 2023  as it‚Äôs on ADB from March  correct me if I‚Äôm wrong,btohqsg
Can  but ocbc titanium rewards card only can use on limited MCC,btohqsg
Actually  for the sms exercise alone  you can earn 4.35% for 4 months without doing anything else vs SCB 3.8% for 2 months,btohqsg
Only thing from T and C is that you get the interest in Sept 2023,btohqsg
I see. Assuming I have 200k - I can see with scb they offer 4% fir 6 months. Wouldn‚Äôt this would be more worth it ? And interest paid each month.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  has anyone tried to qualify for this HSBC EGA welcome reward? Does it conflict with current promo (the one where you earn bonus interest for topping up)?,btohqsg
Yes  if it‚Äôs more than 5 months. But current promo is only 2 months. No guarantee- 1. It will continue another 5 months  2. At the rate of more than 4%,btohqsg
FYI  t bills for both 6 and 12 months are less than 4% now,btohqsg
When I signed up from what I was told by the banker the two promos are different,btohqsg
From my understanding - example if I deposit 100k with esaver now - and before month end I deposit another 100k I will be upgraded to premier and then I‚Äôll get 6 months of 4%,btohqsg
Everyday+ 1% additional interest is on incremental only. I empty out the account at the start of the next month to place the funds in another fresh EGA account to enjoy the max interest.,btohqsg
Better use your cc directGrab no use anymore,btohqsg
Think you are quite familiar and like SCB  do get advice from your RM then and also see Chris‚Äôs video on this  I think he did one before„ÄÇ Good luck,btohqsg
Thanks man  will do for sure üòä,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGhey Chris   do you have an updated video of which is the best saving account for 200k?Wondering about scb and ega  or maybe you got other suggestions? üòÄThanks,btohqsg
If even ega is too complicated for you  then just do FD,btohqsg
Hi Can I top grabpay for the $500 spending for the singsaver reward?,btohqsg
Whats the best way to maximise the maybank visa platinum card? Because it has lesser exclusions  i am able to clock 600-800 per month. But i cannot hit 1k every month for the quarter. So i only suck thumb get $30?,btohqsg
If u can clock so much better use other card like uob One,btohqsg
Anyone sign up for the webull referral free shares? Are we able to sell them or there is a time lock period?,btohqsg
I was able to sell mine.,btohqsg
Clock maybank platinum visa 300$. Uob one 500$. 30+50,btohqsg
As mentioned  reason i can clock so much is due to the not so tight exclusion list,btohqsg
Then buy ntuc voucher to topup,btohqsg
Other cards have more exclusions. Example of my spendings 400 insurance  200 combined of utilities and telcomm bills. The other 200 are misc spending which most cards do not exclude,btohqsg
Use maybank card to buy ntuc voucher ?,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone know what means by this from cardup?Base earn rates of UOB One credit card from 1 Aug 2022does this means we cannot get cash back from UOB one cc already?,btohqsg
