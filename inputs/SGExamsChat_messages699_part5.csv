this is kinda useless too ngl,btohqsg
u find cartesian eqn of 3 planes then solve simult eqns,btohqsg
then can sleep during h2 math?,btohqsg
The math tutor kick the fmath ppl out,btohqsg
we don't even go for h2 math lol,btohqsg
i searched thru my story archive for this,btohqsg
so just 3 subjects for y'all?,btohqsg
mr lim say the fmath kids are actl very pampered compared to the h2 math kids,btohqsg
Wait so your H2 Maths Alevel qn paper/answer booklet does not look like this?^,btohqsg
h2 math ppl got some independent learning thing,btohqsg
watch lecture online then highlight notes,btohqsg
then fm they nice enough to give us classroom setting and go through everything bit by bit,btohqsg
i dun write answers tgt with the question,btohqsg
so he say we are rlly very lucky lol,btohqsg
i will be so damn distracted,btohqsg
meanwhile my bro have 0 live lectures but at the same time i dun see him watching his lectures,btohqsg
mine was like the normal school exam style leh,btohqsg
Silva and his fire emergency alarms.,btohqsg

i tot A level is standard,btohqsg
"""Oh i made every sch have the lightning alert..."" k can we know",btohqsg
but i remember that math have some english questions,btohqsg
like i cant understand one of the stats question,btohqsg
Luckily i got A for H2 Maths sia,btohqsg

idk how did A appear lol,btohqsg
i counted 30m lost each for both p1 and p2,btohqsg
I still rmb swinging pendulums until the other pendulum,btohqsg
physics is pendulum counting  or being amateur electrician,btohqsg
I rmb my physics experiments involve sparks :D,btohqsg
how has the topic suddenly changed all of a sudden,btohqsg
I hated that jc physics experiment,btohqsg
jc physics lab was damn boring,btohqsg
i felt like i'd fall asleep watching the pendulum,btohqsg
i hate chem experiment  esp titration,btohqsg
chem was fun tho the experiments,btohqsg
H2 Chem need memorise all the rxna,btohqsg
oh yea h2 chem the last qns is memorizing game,btohqsg
physics experiments just go in whack only,btohqsg
I had to do 2 diff titrations for A levels,btohqsg
i got D for practical lol in prelims,btohqsg
I still think my B came from practical,btohqsg
h2 chem the last qns is always similar to the prelim  so can memorize the steps,btohqsg
i don't rmb what i got,btohqsg
p sure prac was my best part,btohqsg
In YIJC  no one completes the planning portion for practical,btohqsg
i got D for practical but overall 78%,btohqsg
