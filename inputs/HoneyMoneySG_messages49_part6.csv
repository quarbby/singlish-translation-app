Hi all  sorry can I ask for UOB one CC  if the spending pattern was 500/500/2000 for the 3 mths  does it mean that the cashback is only 50$ and not 500*3.33% + 500*3.33% + 2000* 3.33%?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know that are favepay and shopback transactions billed as online transactions?  e.g. Citi SMRT card. Are they catalegorized as online payments by UOB EVOL cards?,btohqsg
Also can UOB one CC be paired w Atome/shopback to count towards 3 mths min spend? E.g 6k payments -> use atome/ shopback to split into 3 payments of 2k to hit the min 2k spend tier per mth?,btohqsg
It takes the lowest amount. Very hard to keep track.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if using Atome is considered online payments for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg

Hello.. abit non-topic here but any MacBook Pro user here? I am thinking about getting MacBook Pro but can‚Äôt decide between M2 Pro and M2 Max. I don‚Äôt do video content or video editing. Just causal use and for studying. Sometimes I game AAA titles. Base 512GB I feel not sufficient as I want to bootcamp a Windows to play Xbox games pass. 1TB 3.5k and M2 Max 4.5k. üòÖ‚Ä¶ I feel expensive but I feel MacBook very durable than windows laptop. Maybe worth the investment?,btohqsg
New MacBook no longer boot-campable  and please   don‚Äôt game on MacBook ü´†ü´†ü´†ü´†Can consider cross border (go MY) to buy   since MY price is still ard 10% cheaper   and can take advantages on FCY rebate or extra miles on some credit cards,btohqsg
Hi guys  I used revo thru favepay to pay for food places and purchased an e-card during my checkout for partial of the transaction. But seems like the whole transaction is then considered 4111 and excluded from 9x bonus points anyone encountered this as well?,btohqsg
Alamak.. game is must worz. I see YouTube and most of them said MacBook can game and better to get M2 Max.. but you know it‚Äôs >4K lol,btohqsg
If not boot-campable then how to boot to Windows worz?,btohqsg
Can game  but not under window LOL. It kinda make more sense to buy a XBox for XGP.,btohqsg
Haha boot camp is a history now.M2P is def enuf for study and casual use  but let‚Äôs not derail the topic discussed in this group,btohqsg
M2 pro is definitely enough  and drains less battery than Max. Gaming is possible but can‚Äôt go max settings on macs.,btohqsg
If there any big difference between 512GB and 1TB?,btohqsg
what food places? how u know the mcc?,btohqsg
Anyone know if the Enhanced retirement sum (currently is SGD298k) is the max that I can put for CPF Life? Can I put more than this?,btohqsg
I heard SSD speed increased for 1tb,btohqsg
Go to fund portfolio  trading history   too see your pending or filled.,btohqsg
Yea u can‚Äôt game on MacBook now that u can‚Äôt dual boot on it. My regular use I suggest just get MacBook Air. The m series chip is more than good enough,btohqsg
M2 air works on dota2 ah?,btohqsg
How come can‚Äôt dual boot? Windows 10 still can right? I see from Apple Support site de.,btohqsg
TBH - same opinion as the rest  having owned >5 macbook pros  >3 macbook airs and Xbox.You're better off getting a combo of macbook air / ipad for casual use / traveling + gaming laptop ryzen/xbox/PS5.,btohqsg
I know Intel/AMD laptop can game well  and cheaper than MacBook. I never use MacBook before  thought about trying haha. Cos I heard MacBook very durable.. >5 years still good. Battery also good. Laptop battery die fast over the period of years if left uncharged.. meaning running on battery. Not sure if running on battery affect the FPS. And laptop is heavier than MacBook also. Haha.,btohqsg
M series macbook don't support bootcamp/dual boot anymore. So youre out of luck for gaming. Better to get cheaper models on the Air for casual long term.,btohqsg
The new 15‚Äù MacBook Air ah? Haha,btohqsg
This sounds like a pretty cool concept. Would be cool if Chris can do a video covering this üëç,btohqsg
