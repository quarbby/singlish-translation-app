At this rate my gpa is going,btohqsg
pgde and diped is the same application,btohqsg
just tht one is diploma one is postgraduate,btohqsg
U need to teach at least 2 subjects or smth I remembered asking my ex teacher before,btohqsg
yea but it's not useful for him for another 2 years,btohqsg
But i dont think it really matters to me where i teach i just wanna teach,btohqsg
as in he's not done with his degree yet,btohqsg
as long as u in uni,btohqsg
After that PDGE need to start with a contract teaching stint anyways,btohqsg
issue is idt his gpa is high enough,btohqsg
I'm going for diped first before pursuing degree in Chinese studies,btohqsg
PGDE is just insanely competitive that you're just auto out if your gpa isn't there,btohqsg
I heard to be even considered you need 2nd upper,btohqsg
Yeah the minimum is SCH I think,btohqsg
I probably need a 5.5 gpa every sem from now on to reach 2nd upper by the end of 4 years,btohqsg
Chinese teachers are rare in SG(?),btohqsg
ye most of them from china,btohqsg
Give Si Yan your TA your very best,btohqsg
but the good thing is you're not as locked into teaching since your degree can do other stuff,btohqsg
That's honestly the good thing about STEM,btohqsg
All I can do with mine is toliet paper,btohqsg
I dont have much ambition in life so,btohqsg
Something to get by is good enough,btohqsg
I don't wanna survive I WANNA LIVE!,btohqsg
one of my friends didn't do well enough for A levels to do B.Ed so she did DipEd then try to have a high enough GPA to like upgrade to Bachelors,btohqsg
tbh idk if she made it,btohqsg
smth to give you money so you can do other things,btohqsg
People to do what they hate for money to use the money to do what they love,btohqsg
anyway same set of responsibilities so pay shld be the same,btohqsg
sounds like a Jimmy yang line,btohqsg
Isn't it the same applicant pool,btohqsg
Imo I find the degree for education very restricted,btohqsg
U legit cannot branch out at all,btohqsg
I see youre a man of culture,btohqsg
i was thinking the exact same line,btohqsg
i mean that's the thing lor. benefit of going degree directly is you can teach higher level and is secured. dip means it's a shorter programme but if you wanna do degree there's additional requirements,btohqsg
but my that friend likes to teach music so not like her options were many to begin with,btohqsg
I mean like NIE in general,btohqsg
Even for music conservatory get a degree in music can still be used for a career in orchestra,btohqsg
a lot of people that do the degree legit do it so they can jump to private tuition once their MOE contract ends,btohqsg
she doesn't wanna be a performer  she wants to teach,btohqsg
Then can claim ex moe blablabla,btohqsg
Call me maybe ... not?Many under 40 say they prefer texting over phone calls. Some even say cold calls trigger a deep fear that something is wrong. A journalism lecturer explains why phone call phobia  if you have it  could affect your career:https://cna.asia/3LbSC1nDo you struggle with phone call anxiety?,btohqsg
Yala basically that's my point lor it's for teaching is strictly that,btohqsg
how long does moe contracts ususally last,btohqsg
anyway if you compare degree in education for the subject vs the actual subject major  music is as far as you'd get,btohqsg
there's really no relation between the two,btohqsg
I am so traumatised after coming to smu,btohqsg
Ya basically yes my point is even in STEM or humanities is far away,btohqsg
U can't even branch into academia other than education academia,btohqsg
