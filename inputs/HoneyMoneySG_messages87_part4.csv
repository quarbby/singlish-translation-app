Hi!  Read somewhere that you can’t earn bonus miles on SPC  with certain card.  Is this the uob preferred platinum?,btohqsg
Hi saw the UOB power duo promo. (One acc + Stash acc with $100k each). Is it worth?,btohqsg
Hi i am deciding between UOB PPV and the UOB KF cc. Any preference on what i should apply for?,btohqsg
It's more than 5 transactionsI use it for day to day payment such as simplygo food/ wtv that accepts paywave,btohqsg
That is very subjective. If you are a trader or business man that can grow your capital at 10% per month  it is not worth.If you are bank FD or saving account supporter  then it is a different story.,btohqsg
Anyone recommends getting scb rewards + ?,btohqsg
I would still recommend the majority to have this thinking:Split your Assets into 2 piles:1. Investment (can lose) = go do riskier investments that can make or lose money.2. Emergency Funds (cannot lose) = only put into safe investments like SSBs  Tbills  Fixed Deposit. That have close to 0 chance to lose money. To be clear  I do not consider webull / moomoo and the like in this category.What proportion of Investment vs Emergency Funds depends on your own household needs  but as a suggestion  it could be 80/20.,btohqsg
Hello guys  using UOB One Card  does road tax consider as eligible?,btohqsg
What does your cc statements say? Minus off ineligible transactions as stated in TNC. Some examples of ineligible transactions are payment to insurance  mobile wallet top-up  UNI$ rewarded transactions.,btohqsg
hahahaha u literally said this like a million times to all the questions,btohqsg
Yes hahaha because somehow people don't try the available info first,btohqsg
u are like the school teacher...,btohqsg
Hi all  I'm trying to start investing approx $300-$500 per month. I have existing account with Moomoo & Tiger Brokers.What are some of the app you would recommend for monthly DCA  and what stocks do I look out for (hoping to purchase with fractional share option since i may not be able to buy the entire share with these small amount of money)?,btohqsg
Hi all  just to check I do not have a UOB one account. If I open now thru online will have up to $68 cash? But what is the criteria?,btohqsg
as what@MelvynEzisaid  what does the tnc say?,btohqsg
In fact this chat have many parts of tnc that are summarised already  people just don't want to search lol,btohqsg
Do you have an idea of what stocks you’re open to considering/buying? Or maybe what sectors of the market are you familiar with?,btohqsg
I'm considering between tech  FI and green energy stocks. AAPL  TSLA  C. And maybe ETFs but unsure which to start with for ETF,btohqsg
Does amaze still work with uob krisflyer for contactless spend? Given the latest saga with citirewards,btohqsg
The giro criteria is there any workaround rather than set-up from a payment?,btohqsg
At 300-500 a month  i would not spread too much across different stocks/etfs and just consolidate to one single broad based index fund e.g. S&P500  MSCI World or FTSE All-world,btohqsg
Sidenote: 13 min to SC Flash Deal for Dyson Airwrap!https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/167269,btohqsg
Just out of curiosity  why would that be the case?Cause for example with $500 USD  I may purchase 2 AAPL / TSLA stock  while the remainder gets to go into an ETF like the ones you mentioned,btohqsg
And if these get done on a monthly basis  with rotation of stocks purchased (AAPL / TSLA / AMD etc). I'm diversify my stock purchases with DCA in mind while still purchasing S&P500.Are there other factors I missed if I do it this way?,btohqsg
This should be the default answer for 90% of questions posed here,btohqsg
If I’m reading your plan correctly  it means that in the long run your strategy is about 70% made up of individual stock picks  and about 30% broad market ETFs?,btohqsg
Short term plan  likely that way. Eventually I would like it to be 50-50  but ETF like S&P500 is too big for me to start purchasing it as 1 unit,btohqsg
Unit size isn’t really an issue  plenty of platforms around that offer fractional buysBigger question is what is your “ideal” allocation,btohqsg
As time passes  my income will be higher thus easier to pump money into ETF in future context,btohqsg
That's true too  that's why seeking the general concept in here to see how do you guys allocate the funds when starting outIdeally it would be a 50-50 or 50-40-10 (ETF-Stocks-Crypto),btohqsg
This plan seems to be reducing the diversification if you gonna purchase stocks that is already is in s&p 500. Like adding weight to the stocks.,btohqsg
I had that thought too  but S&P500 picks the top 500. The stocks I picked are just my novice perspective of booming blue chip stocksI do have bias opinion on other stocks like NIO too,btohqsg
But now trying to get general concept and finding out how the thought process is like,btohqsg
Just food for thought is after all that is this really diversificaiton when but mostly still in US stocks/US involved assets.I mean maybe more spread out in terms of industry  but wonder if any shifu here got any thoughts about investing in other countries other than the US?,btohqsg
Do you spend more than $1600 a month? If yes  go ahead and get the Lady's card and set the category to the one you will spend the most (e.g. dining),btohqsg
Hi guys  can citi payall setup to pay for utilities (SP) and season parking (HDB)? When i tried  it prompted for the bank account of the recipient which i cannot find online?,btohqsg
How I see it is  the baseline is whole world stock index. Then from there you can make modifications depending on your economic outlook.- If you focus on US stocks  then your outlook is that moving forward  US stocks will continue to outperform the rest of the world.- If you purchase individual US stocks  then your outlook is that moving forward  these specific stocks will continue to outperform not only the rest of the US stock market  but also the rest of the world.- Same as above if you make yourself overweight on market factors (small cap  mid cap  growth  value  dividend  etc),btohqsg
This is under utilities.. need bank account number?,btohqsg
Pay via electricity then you will know if it works. U Never try u never know.,btohqsg
Season parking & town council got ways?,btohqsg
How do you usually pay these two?,btohqsg

Can we get 4mpd if we add CRMC in ShopBack app? Or must add amaze + CRMC to get 4mpd?Cuz I remember hearing CRMC doesn’t work for in-app,btohqsg
Quick question guys.If i were to book tickets through airpaz  would I not get the 6mpd for UOB lady's?Instead i will have to book directly?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword “Crmc shopback” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposes a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code. Eg “Airpaz”.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Ah was thinking of downloading their app,btohqsg
