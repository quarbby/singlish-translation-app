hi i‚Äôve recently got my citi card replaced due to a fraud transaction with a new card number etc. the bank officer told me that giro arrangement remains unchanged and no action is required as they have transferred the giro arrangement to the new card. but when i check my UOB account  the giro arrangement is still tag to my old citi card number. i confirmed this with a few officers at Citi and they said they can see the giro is active for my new card. any advice? i don‚Äôt want to miss out paying my card if giro failed to deduct..,btohqsg
