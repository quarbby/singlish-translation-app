heyy for UOB visa signature the 2k limit is based on absolute spend? or is the limit based on the bonus UNI$ that you'll get?,btohqsg
UOB VS issit can use like PPV because i called their customer service he tell me shopee grabfood dont have bonus UNI$ and all my petrol aiming for 6mpd through ladys  not sure if can hit min 1k spend anot,btohqsg
For the case of UOB visa sig  both are the same. UOB will add all ur qualified transactions at the end of *statement* month and award uni$. So 2k regardless.,btohqsg
For sgd trnx  UOB VS can only be used for contactless. Use your ppv or Citi rewards for shopee etc.,btohqsg
Ah your ppv spend is not offline? If more online spend then you add dbs women then. 4mpd online at 1.5k cap. Can use to buy air tix and book hotel/activities via OTA.,btohqsg
From what I know  either 1-2k on paywave for sgd transactions  or 1-2k on online/in person foreign currency spend for 4mpd. Petrol is not sure. Please read this article as it‚Äôs fairly complicated cardhttps://milelion.com/2024/03/23/review-uob-visa-signature-card/,btohqsg
my PPV spend is like 300 online 800 offline  if VS can cover the 800 through paywave then i can try apply for it  just worried about their category exclusions cos even their call centre cannot answer my questions,btohqsg
How about directing all paywave offline spend to uob vs? Like from crmc and ppv. If you don't spend 1k offline paywave then dbs women is a good candidate.,btohqsg
ok ill apply and give it a shot  dbs woman points expiry is 1 year isssit and cannot amaze right?,btohqsg
For dbs women yes  it's a good card but those are its quirks.,btohqsg
You can try CardUp or iPayMy to get some miles out of it. Will need to pay a fee though.,btohqsg
Meaning no interest credit today  right?,btohqsg
hi. anyone receive call from uob offering saving strategy to add 2-4% to the bonus interest when u hit the max of 150k?,btohqsg
Yup I did. Meeting the person on Saturday. They said cannot share over the phone,btohqsg

üòÇ‚Ä¶.. another selling insurance linked policy tactic‚Ä¶. Let me know if my guess is correct or not.,btohqsg
My guess is they may introduce UOB funds to you. The medium risk portfolio return is about 4.2%,btohqsg
Can but non guaranteed. Enter KF number in the apps.,btohqsg
But why ‚Äúcannot share over the phone‚Äù,btohqsg

Yup will share. Hope she don't hard sell me anything. I hate hard selling,btohqsg
She said alot of scams nowadays. Want to avoid that,btohqsg
that's what a scammer would say üôä,btohqsg
