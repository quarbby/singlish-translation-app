Yes I seen exam papers uploaded there,btohqsg
nope like if you're below 85  you're alr gonna be cut out of most scholarships unless you have an insanely good portfolio,btohqsg
Because ppl have mentioned my way of teaching may not suit jc students and indeed that's the case.,btohqsg
So I only recommend it under last resort,btohqsg
I trying to work out ways to improve my understanding of the techniques how h2 students learn math before releasing notes for routine uses,btohqsg
I thought some Chem and gp notes from there already haha,btohqsg
Under 87.5 is already no scholarships,btohqsg
My friend said 88 is bonded and 90 is non bonded,btohqsg
not necessarily  but yea the number of people getting high rp is too inflated for <85 to get you anywhere,btohqsg
Wonder how 70rp will affect it,btohqsg
Probably perfect score 70rp is key to get scholarships.  At best you need 67.5/70 rp,btohqsg
Happy Pi Day to everyone and Happy Term 1 School Holidays to all students!,btohqsg
i often procrastinate a lot so i can understand the feeling of being weeks behind lectures and the stress of failing the exams. i learnt that most people do well with mind maps (i interviewed most of the ppl who score 3.7 and above fr gpa). my advice is try experimenting the different styles of learning best catered to your needs. if u are tired and procrastinate a lot  have a light revision. being consistent is the key to good grades. if you’re a last minute crammer  focus on the important information on your notes  past year papers  worksheets and read thru the textbook.imo  tuition have both benefits and disadvantages. a student can greatly benefit from tuition if they have great attitude to study.  i feel that most tuition notes or lecturers are quite repetitive to the textbook. however  if u need extra help and coaching from tuition teacher to understand the topics  don’t be afraid to reach out. u cn also ask ur frnds and teachers questions that you’re unsure of and they will help you out. most teachers  in fact all  care about every individual student and want to bring the best out of them. don’t be afraid and reach them for help.,btohqsg
Anyone here studying in the UK right now?,btohqsg
