got a lot of packs in the world go for a lot of money,btohqsg
Would make sense to buy boxes or packs and just wait,btohqsg
will go from $5 to $500 or $1000,btohqsg
ya got people really try that,btohqsg
and if that pack rare right might go for a lot too,btohqsg
I guess its a risk if they open it they may make more money than if they sell it,btohqsg
What would you do if like in the future you have 1 pack it would sell few hundred,btohqsg
But also got chance of few thousand,btohqsg
Honestly ill just cash out like risky if you open,btohqsg
