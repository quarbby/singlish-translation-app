Buying watches and bags overseas  you can consider Amaze + UOB KF CC. But do check the MCC of the merchant matches the UOB KF CC MCC whitelist before you proceed.,btohqsg
UOB prvi has 2.4mpd so it's 1.35cpm. it's not bad if one wants to be miles chaser. But I agree w you that better use amaze with 4mpd card like crmc/UOB lady for overseas.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if linked UOB one to amaze  will it count as credit card spending? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
if it can even be linked  then yes(uob one is visa  cannot link to amaze),btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your opinion.,btohqsg
Noob   question tho. How do you guys count cpm?,btohqsg
cost divided by # of miles,btohqsg
But there is no cost here.,btohqsg
Anybody can share which card can be used for paying road tax and still earn cashback/miles?,btohqsg
Search chat history “road tax card”,btohqsg
Hi guys. Any of you invested in either one of this?,btohqsg
This is from UOB tmrw app btw,btohqsg
Some merchant use nets machine to accept cc too. Just ask if they take cc,btohqsg
Isnt this like robo investment or something like that? I forgot whats that called,btohqsg
Nope I invest through UOBAM instead,btohqsg
Not sure. I was just exploring the app and found this.,btohqsg
How are they different? And do I have to sign up soearately for the UOBAM?,btohqsg
Yea  not sure what’s the difference. Probably the fund types,btohqsg
Do I need to sign up a new account or I can use the same old UOB app?,btohqsg
Why not just download the app and try,btohqsg
My experience with these 2 UOB apps is UOB TMRW app will auto select the funds based on the risk profile you choose. Ex Low-Moderate Risk -> UOB Income Trust fund. As for the UOBAM Invest  you can directly choose the funds you want to invest. I guess for most people  if they dont want to dabble with stocks as investment  the risk profile -> fund option works best for them. I choose the Moderate Risk which selects the Income Trust fund for me  so far  it is giving me 4-4.8% returns.,btohqsg
Thanks Jeremy. Is there interest of 4.7% guaranteed or there might be a chance where you may lose you initial amount  like stock market investments. I'm new to this  and I thought of moving my savings into UOBAM Cash+ to earn the interest rather than letting it sit in my savings account collecting dust. Thank you,btohqsg
For recurring subscriptions for Netflix/Fitness First/Singtel  these are eligible MCC for Citi Rewards Card. Just to confirm  will I earn bonus miles for recurring CC transactions?,btohqsg
It is up to 4.7%. Your capital is not at risk of losing but I dont think the interest gain it is performing at that level yet. I put in 5 months and I gain 1.5%,btohqsg
"Oooooo now i get it. ""Up to""",btohqsg
It is up to 4.7 per annum  so 1.5 for 4 month is on track  u put tbill 3 plus percent also is per annum so i think u all need to learn how to view interest given in the correct manner,btohqsg
He is own self post own self talking in his channel  forward seth  aaron article  seedly all those to treat as sharing. I muted the channel,btohqsg
Not too sure leh  i thought he was banned,btohqsg
Not surprising  he doesn’t have his own opinion and follow what people apply or cancel,btohqsg
He like to find some existence by standing out in such a manner i guess,btohqsg
How do you see the capital gain %  mine shows 1.8% 13$ increase but 10$ is the referral reward,btohqsg
Hahaha so he can only see but not chat?,btohqsg
So now he’s stealing ideas  posting on his group  then hear people’s opinion,btohqsg
He not here so no opinion stolen from here,btohqsg
He just keep forward message loh from different group,btohqsg
Hi bros and sis  just an update. This card maximiser from heymax is a pretty good tool. Just spent using my revo then straight away it shows the mcc and points earned. Useful for tallying up pointsBut too bad only support visa now,btohqsg
The mcc is great. Now  we have heymax for visa and amaze for mastercard to check mcc 😂,btohqsg

Yea but thing about amaze is you have to link it to empty wallet then still check against the tnc of the card to use . Better than nothing ig,btohqsg
"You never start your message with ""hi bros and sis  just for update""",btohqsg
Hi guys  does anyone know if DBS points will get removed/deleted if I were to cancel my DBS CC?,btohqsg
Yaps. No need empty wallet though  just turn off the online payment or instore payment toggles works for me,btohqsg
And if I were to convert those points to KF miles  does it come with an expiration date? Appreciate your input on this. Thanks! 🙏,btohqsg
Wah super fast response! Thank you Jasmine!,btohqsg
Thanks Queenie. I'll look into it. Sorry I'm a newbie and just learning on all this,btohqsg
Then wouldn't it cost more if use amaze? If amaze mark up is 2%.2%/1.2 = 1.66cpm,btohqsg
I don't see a point in using Amaze with a general spend card  I only use with 4mpd/6mpd cards. If i run out of cards  i'll just use the general spend card direct.,btohqsg
I have being doing it wrong. 😱I used amaze for everything overseas.,btohqsg
Not wrong or what ah just that value of miles u earn become more ex,btohqsg
My miles earn mostly below 1 cent per miles de  above 1.5 cent per miles i wont get liao,btohqsg
