i mean if u aim for the moon...u land on the stars if u fail...,btohqsg
The reason why i feel like this is how i want to live my life is because the three biggest role models in my life...my father and two uncles are living this way,btohqsg

like i said earlier.. different people have different goals in life.. i know what youâ€™re trying to say  aim for the moon but youâ€™ll get less  but maybe some people just want to get by  tend to have luxuries every now and then  but their priority is just living with happiness,btohqsg
its normal..because the last thing they want is you to face stagnation,btohqsg
