COE quota should consume only 1 since same person..  give the quota to someone else..,btohqsg
I never understood the need for 1 person to have 10 cars,btohqsg
Maybe drive 2 remaining 8 is storage,btohqsg
Or maybe allow multiple cars per person  but at anytime only 1 can be driven. So technically speaking the person just need 1 COE,btohqsg
Nevermind.. rich man's collection/toy ma.. buy as many coe as he wan  but should only use 1 quota..,btohqsg
Garnement should separate coe and quota lol..,btohqsg
COE is for the car. Not the person,btohqsg
So it makes perfect sense. Want multiple car  pay the coe,btohqsg
Yes. But should consume only 1 quota since coe is to control the number of cars on the road not the number of cars in your garage.,btohqsg
The cars in e garage will be on the road,btohqsg
Really only 2 driving 8 storage de,btohqsg
2 driving  2 in cp or 1 driving 3 in cp,btohqsg

Tats why coe per person  can have multiple cars  any 1 time  only 1 car. What we want is less cars on the road  dc how many u hiding in ur hse,btohqsg
