Depends on the collective responsibility part. Parents are responsible indeed but there's only so many times u can blame poor parenting,btohqsg
What do yall get hit by,btohqsg
Probably because the separate school would not yield the same opportunities,btohqsg
Some parents cannot accept the diagnosis and expect things to turn normal,btohqsg

It likely is  look at how the JCs affected were just all the government non IP JCs  nothing else.https://mothership.sg/2017/04/ex-nmp-calvin-cheng-makes-the-point-about-the-jc-mergers-that-no-one-wants-to-talk-about/,btohqsg
It ain't even a fucking spectrum sometimes the line between autism and other disorders frequently changes over revised DSMs,btohqsg
kuro's entire identity is being old,btohqsg
and getting triggered when group work is brought up,btohqsg
he actually had because if it was a normal student  he wont have passed that module,btohqsg
that submission failed 3 main criterias for the submission,btohqsg
"From the article""The Government may need to avoid sounding elitist but I don't.Birth rates have fallen and in choosing which JCs to close  one has to go with the least popular JCs. That is  the ones with the highest cut off points. Elite JCs are highly competitive — there will always be more demand than supply.Merging Hwa Chong and RJC is thus a ridiculous idea.Why the new JC Eunoia? It's not a normal JC. It is being set up as another elite JC to take in IP students from several elite secondary schools - Catholic High  St Nicholas  SCGS.Civil servants won't be able to give you this reply of course. But it's the truth.""",btohqsg
you cant say that to a submission like this,btohqsg
when not a single criteria was even made,btohqsg
