Has anyone went to court for speeding ?,btohqsg
Gotta prepare for the worst so i take it as a yes ah,btohqsg
The letter said 41-50 kmh over speed limit,btohqsg
I mean i confirm i dint went that fast,btohqsg
idk lah idt it be thst bad?,btohqsg
It was a afternoon going to tampines,btohqsg
i doubt take away yr license but might give u warning n shit,btohqsg
What's the speed limit on that rd,btohqsg
Nah minus demerit points and fine i guess  i not sure,btohqsg
Like cannot be afternoon traffic speed 130 140 mah,btohqsg
As of what the letter said ah,btohqsg
Could it be capture wrongly ?,btohqsg
Hmm even so i dont think i went pass so much,btohqsg
If got hard evidence they won‚Äôt say much. Admit and pledge for leniency if got good record.If they don‚Äôt have they will interview you. Then u see how confident. Sometime even threaten you de,btohqsg
I heard from my friend saying that since i first timer  should be ok wont be so jialat,btohqsg
i think now these days they can check how fast u going at what time from the vehicle no?,btohqsg
My van dash cam spoilt  for some reason it melted,btohqsg

Yea  i got the van not long ago  i drove awhile and it droped,btohqsg

no one can argue with video evidence,btohqsg
If they got hard evidence i speed ah?,btohqsg
Cause i also not sure if speed cam or sniper catch me,btohqsg
The letter say along tpe 12.5km > pie,btohqsg
Yes it worksJudge always see ppl argue Sebei buay song multiply the charges LLI experience myself,btohqsg
But could it be they capture wrongly ?,btohqsg
Like maybe got car beside me speed then kena me,btohqsg
These days.. quite hard unless faulty If you got hear your van's speed limit warning going off then yea speeding liao.,btohqsg
Hmm ü§îIs quite hard wrong infoI ever see they demonstrate the camera on TV they can capture individual speed at different lane,btohqsg
apparently now like u drive side by side with thr car they can also catch both cars,btohqsg
instead of the one facing closes to camera,btohqsg
Was caught at 140 going home,btohqsg
Just pay fine and move on,btohqsg
Unless this is a frequent offense,btohqsg
I assume 12 demerit points ?,btohqsg
Lucky my p plate droped last year,btohqsg
