This month seems to have issues. Just wait bah.,btohqsg
Trust interest cut until so pathetic alr,btohqsg
You need giro from company account.,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs wait for updates from the other banks. Eventually OCBC  UOB and others will reduce their rates.,btohqsg
matters if did not fulfilled requirements already last month  need to fulfil requirements (5 transactions and 2k/5k in) then start get 1% rebate for eligible transactions next day onwards,btohqsg
more to come.. more to come,btohqsg
I think recently transaction after 10th Oct  lots of ppl just didn't get the cashback. Cuz of some technical issue on hsbc side.,btohqsg
So don't need to call cso. It is happened before. Although this time seem like taking long time to fixed. Guess they already knew. So for those will get will get. Just cool down and wait.,btohqsg
Think the other issue is when the merchant officially charges the card also‚Ä¶. I bought my iPhone but the charge only came few days after I bought ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
hello  sorry following up on this  does anyone know if I still can get the welcome bonus if I make payments via cardup?,btohqsg
U need to see tnc for the signup promo,btohqsg
Trying to pick the brains of gurus here. I‚Äôm planning to buy a MacBook direct from Apple Store (Orchard/MBS/Jewel). Cc benefits aside  would Jewel be the best store to purchase from? Since they are under capitaland and I can accum capitastar. Trying to see what other perks I can benefit from this big purchase. Thanks!,btohqsg
Apple store in jewel not participating merchant,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a cap on CapitaLand points,btohqsg
Meaning not participating to earn capitaStar points is it?,btohqsg
Yes  if there is not special reason to purchase macbook from apple there are other merchant that u can buy from,btohqsg
Oh..good tip TQ. Thought I could at least get some mall points. ya I got some corporate discount only if i buy from Apple Store  and not authorized resellers.,btohqsg
Hi all. If I am going to make a purchase of 1000 at Best Denki  would using Amaze + UOB Kris Flyer earn the 3MPD for online purchases?,btohqsg
For EGA  to sit out Nov for max interest in Dec  need to empty out today  is that correct?,btohqsg
Amaze still can dance üíÉ üï∫üèª with UOB?,btohqsg
Yes it‚Äôs 5732 and consider as online shopping whitelist according to MileLion,btohqsg
No. You missed the UOB nerf on amaze.,btohqsg
Oh ya I forgot about this‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Uob exclude amaze  u can ask staff if best denki can generate online link. If not 1k spend is good for uob ppv or uob vs mobile contactless spending,btohqsg
Damn‚Ä¶ guess the only card left to use is UOB PRVI for me,btohqsg
Can buy via Best Denki online website using UOB KF?,btohqsg
depends on your amount. you can still move out $250k on 1st Nov itself,btohqsg
We have special discount from the sales person,btohqsg
I am not sure whether it works or not.   Nobody try this before.You can try buying Best Denki voucher from Wogi n redeem it at Best Denki. Check with the staff is he ok to accept this arrangement.At your own risks.,btohqsg
So the same fresh funds of 100k from 1 Nov - 31 Dec can qualify for the two months of interest ? Or need to take out 100k again on 1 Dec and put back in ?,btohqsg
it's actually from 1st October to 31st December.Have a read of the TNC.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/243460,btohqsg
Thank you for all your kind replies. Riding on this what would be the best setup if I wanna earn miles while traveling?,btohqsg
Amaze + Citi Rewards for non-travel related transactions.UOB VS for travel related transactions.If you bust the S$2 000 cap for UOB VS  then use Maybank Horizon Visa (min spend $800 for a promo rate of 3.2 mpd) or World Mastercard (min spend $800 for 2.8 mpd or $4k for 3.2 mpd),btohqsg
For the fairprice app payment  can I just link my CRMC directly or do I still have to go through Amaze card?,btohqsg
can enter the crmc details directly in fairprice app,btohqsg
Avoid using Citi rewards via Applepay in Fairprice apps. Must enter details directly.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm comparing air ticket options: if I book a return ticket to Europe through Lufthansa (flights operated by Lufthansa )  it costs SGD 1 000.However  redeeming economy tickets with miles requires 100 000 miles plus around SGD 350 in airport taxes (able to choose Turkish air  and SQ operated flights).I asked if I could use miles to upgrade to business class when booking three months in advance  but I was told it‚Äôs only possible by paying a cash top-up. I had the same issue last year. I don‚Äôt mind paying cash for the tickets and then using miles for an upgrade  but that option never seems to be available.My question is‚Ä¶ is it better to pay sgd 1k cash for air tickets or spend 100 000 miles + sgd350 airport tax?,btohqsg
This is too good not to share. Bank C asks this question when you apply for Credit Card....,btohqsg
haha err...FATCA compliance? I recognize the font and the bank haha,btohqsg
Hi Chris  do you have any videos on sc esaver to share please?,btohqsg
Sorry I would also like to find out if I were to withdraw my money from my ocbc 360 account tomorrow  would the amount count towards my MAB for this month please?,btohqsg
For the HSBC EGA account  since the deduction to pay CC bill is only done on the last day of the cc due date  will we be charged any late fees as the payment will only be received after a few days for giro setup?(Appreciate if anyone can explain on this. Thanks),btohqsg
Tmr is public holiday so ur withdrawal will only take effect on Nov 1.,btohqsg
If ur cc statements shows that it will be deducted via giro  no problem if the deduction happens on due date.However  pls note that giro setup completion doesn't mean ur cc bill will be paid via giro immediately.,btohqsg
Yup  do understand take it won't take place for the first month to be safe.So following months even if the payment by giro exceeds the due date(time the payment is shown in statement)  there's no penalty right,btohqsg
You gotta understand how giro works.Giro is triggered by cc bank. Let's say setup HSBC ega to pay dbs cc. Dbs will trigger giro deductionn themselves. Trigger can happen earlier or latest on due date itself so there won't be scenario you mention. No need to worry about late fee as long as you maintain sufficient balance in ur ega acct.,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have a SingTel bill charged to amaze and to my Maybank fnf. I checked the benefit optimisation and it‚Äôs displaying $0 at data communication. Any idea why like that ah?,btohqsg
I see. So I should always maintain the amt needed to be paid to dbs cc in HSBC acc even before the giro deduction date?,btohqsg
Depends on what you are doing with ur HSBC ega acct.For pure giro payment purpose  I'll transfer the morning of thedue datededuction date (could be same or a few days before depending on banks). If I know I'll be occupied  I'll do a few days in advance.,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks for the kind explanation üòä,btohqsg
