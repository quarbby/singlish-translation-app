Guys! Reminder to pump your petrol before 2359hrs  coz tomorrow start 10% GST. ü§≠,btohqsg
Rate so good today but still got stupid scammer ü§£,btohqsg
They removed the ‚Äòpooling‚Äô orders for tonight uh?,btohqsg
Lala now got withholding CPF? Means?,btohqsg
ya now they deduct comm  gst  withold cpf,btohqsg
Cpf depends on ur opt in status,btohqsg
Medisave compulsory whether u opt in or out2029 everything compulsory,btohqsg
But if I no opt for cpf,btohqsg
Then the cpf portion they deduct from my fare how I get backüò°üòÇ,btohqsg
Sent next day  pooling can be sent within 24hrs,btohqsg
if no opt they still deduct from your earnings to put into medisave  platform operator dont contribute,btohqsg
if opt in then platform operator also contribute but the percentage of earnings that go into your cpf gradually increases from now until 2029,btohqsg
But below the table shows dependent on how much we earn/mth or something like that,btohqsg
So actually they shouldn't deduct a certain sum from every job 1st mahüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Cos there's nthg I can do. If I want do the job then suck thumbüòÇ,btohqsg
Suck thumb  for living don't have choice ü•≤,btohqsg
Now I think will deduct for the cpf withholding,btohqsg
That's y now dunno want opt in bor,btohqsg
Get the feeling will lugi if don't opt kn,btohqsg
But once opt in is forever alr,btohqsg
How much of what they deduct will be given to me,btohqsg
I wan to know this too,btohqsg
Let's say 1 mth the jobs I do,btohqsg
Total they deduct $100 from this cpf withholding,btohqsg
Then does that whole $100 go to my cpf,btohqsg
Then that means I'm paying for others n for llm. Which is not right,btohqsg
But if I don't opt in then supposedly go to my medisave? Then will it all go to my medisave?,btohqsg
Then see what happens end of the mth,btohqsg
Any1 has a clearer idea of how this works? Can advise?,btohqsg
Ya correct cannot be LLM use this to earn the extra $100,btohqsg
Haha jialat all platform worker great 2025 start,btohqsg
Fixed salary different. They get salary once a mth 1 lump sum. So can deduct when they get,btohqsg
Agreed.. still not very clear how it work..,btohqsg
Even if u dont opt in2029 all compulsory,btohqsg
Your platform withhold the amount till end of monthIf u opt in  the amount goes to cpf 3 accountsIf u didnt opt in  medisave portion will be deducted and the rest will release back to your wallet (my guess)Medisave is one of the 3 accounts of cpf,btohqsg
If nv opt in die die also must give us back the money either medisave or back to wallet. If not will be daylight robbery lol,btohqsg
I just count  today did 15 jobs kanna deduct $8.80.,btohqsg
1 month est earn less $200 - $250,btohqsg
I try google  but can't find this,btohqsg
Now till 2029 is transition phaseEven if u opt in now not full deduction and employer contribution,btohqsg
