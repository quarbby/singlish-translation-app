I’ve known heegul for a long while and I understand some frustration sensing his exits are different from his calls.Nonetheless I hope all understand he is a short term trader and very nimble. It is common for anyone to shift own tp when Dow futures dropping for eg. U can change he cannot meh can’t be right?Any calls be it heegul or John or anyone else is just for reference. U want to closely follow u make $ got give angbao to them? No then when u lose u want their heads.Bo ko leng mahWill be monitoring any calls for absurdity. Or call when run few pips alreadySo all please watch your own ass coz nobody will protect it for u,btohqsg
if aspen can survive this fall  and push pass 290  will see 335 on the next 2 days,btohqsg
Heegul give us many angbao with his calls. Appreciated bro,btohqsg
Yeah he is a swing trader and they run by very tight frame by the time most ppl see his calls  might be too late Le,btohqsg
