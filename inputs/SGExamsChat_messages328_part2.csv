And I’m now the victim  oh no,btohqsg
fr eh this whole saga ended yst alr & we weren’t even rly involved,btohqsg
is anyone here early enough to sum up what just happened,btohqsg
katie started accusing jennifer of looking down on nt students js cos jennifer was correcting his english,btohqsg
then isa sided with katie which is a troller n a pervert that send boob pics to random gc,btohqsg
oh jeez how did that come down to you guys fighting among yourselves??,btohqsg
then say as@bigfatbarneyn i were trying to make peace   Hi had to intervene n be extra,btohqsg
if no i suggest you take it and leave,btohqsg
you know what guys  take a deep breathkatie / alvin is honestly just trolling  he's oftenaddedby others (scammers most of the time) — but i agree his actions can lead to disagreements and whatnot but to each their owni think the looking down on nt students is a misunderstanding and an honest mistake that both jennifer and alvin made  and it's okay bc we all misunderstand sometimes!among the 3 of you  great on trying to make peace! i think we all appreciate it but take a deep breath and take it slow  idt we wanna fight here anyway ^^it's too early to argue so i hope you all have a gd day ahead 😅,btohqsg
isa kept siding alvin when hes a troller,btohqsg
Um bro what’s wrong with trolling heartless scammers,btohqsg
But wtv  ig if you don’t like it  you don’t like it,btohqsg
plus it’s so obv isa isn’t trolling,btohqsg
whatever literally so extra probably a boomer,btohqsg
