Oh crap. Genie left the group? Then who did I post the kkj rocket to? üò±,btohqsg
Apologies to the other genie in this groupüëâüëà,btohqsg
I mean he left the other group,btohqsg
Btw does MT will be same as TG after releasing result?,btohqsg
MT : I think the key takeaway as follows1. Q3 Net profit expectedly higher than Q2  so no unpleasant surprise.2. Coy indicates record revenue n profit in the Q4  so the amazing story will continue at least for the following Q. In fact  the USD60 million UK contract may indicate a good surprise going forward. Note Q2 and Q3 revenue is the region of 120 to 126 million. That's almost half already  excluding their usual sales channels.2. Long term orders.. I would take it at least the next 6 months... So meaning the next 2 quarters still got story to tell...,btohqsg
He said we work for bbüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Ok la you shout many micro pennies leh,btohqsg
???those I nv jio ppl to buy,btohqsg

Morning All. Today MT long green candle.Why MT will have sustainable growth beyond 2021 - Part 2:In part 2 let us look at macro factors.Otside of China MT is the biggest PPE manufacturer with factories in Philippines  Cambodia. China and Taiwan. Philippines and Cambodia is where MT makes most of the high demand PPE.Philippines and Cambodia have tariff free entry to US and European markets. Trade barriers have stacked up against China to these markets off late and this is not going to change. Supply of poor quality and faulty Ppe from China has deteriorated image of quality coming out of China.There is more awareness of importance of Ppe. According to WHO and other experts Ppe is the one thing than has prevented Covid from further spread. There is increased awareness and demand in hospitals as well as countries to maintain a good stock pile of Ppe going forward.All these will add to sustainable growth for MT.I think of MT as the Top Glove in PPE industry (non glove). Given the current price of MT it is like buying a share of TG for 75 cents.All this is facts with my interpretation added. Always do your own fact check and decide for yourself. Your money your decision.,btohqsg

Wait for a $0.081 or $0.082 close or any positive announcements and can expect rally to come. Evidently  BBs are inside and they have collected a chunk.,btohqsg
