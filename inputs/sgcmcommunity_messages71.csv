Do you guys think they should do a background health check on people who are taking their driver’s license?,btohqsg
The family member of the deceased honda driver told everyone that he has history of fits and seizures,btohqsg
Wouldn’t a person who has that  be a hazard on the road,btohqsg
Also serious discussion and no disrespect,btohqsg
Seizures can’t be predicted. One can only take medications. It’s just like heart attack  or any other health issues that just pop up out of the blue.,btohqsg
Supposed to declare and legally not supposed to even attempt to get license,btohqsg
There is possibility  gotten the seizures illnesses after getting license .I have friend who gotten mild stroke. Cannot drive untill clear by Medical Officer.,btohqsg
Why Oil Cooler is install when there is radiator + intercooler for turbo car?@arnavguliani,btohqsg

Using a different engine oil will void your warranty? - J,btohqsg
i let my car run on battery for more than 20mins  they want to void my warranty alr,btohqsg
If his car on battery power for more than 20 minutes also void warranty,btohqsg
gave them my car for 2 days to change 1 stupid battery,btohqsg
Some people drive EV cannot use Engine oil leh,btohqsg
tried to void my warranty if cem (similar to ecu) said that there was 3 ocassions that battery was runned from 20-40 mins and 1 ocassion that that battery was runned for more than 40 minutes. They count that as misuse of battery and wanted to void my batt warranty,btohqsg
https://time.com/5287517/world-war-ii-queen-elizabeth-photo/Side note.The late Queen Elizabeth II is regarded as a car person too.,btohqsg
"Service consultant called me tell me CEM detect 3 times of usage 20-40min and 1 time more than 40 minutes. Tell me because of this they will void my battery warranty. I ask them where did they write black and white that this will cause my warranty to be void.""its a general car thing sir. any brand you go to will void your warranty. you learn it in driving school (???)""i just tell him its not in black and white stated clearly and explicitly explained to me during collection that the car running solely on battery will get the warranty to be voided.Then he tell me he will call me back in 15mins  he will check with his manager.2mins later  ""out of goodwill we will replace the battery for free.""",btohqsg
they very nice one  everytime use same reason tell me good will,btohqsg
desperately trying to increase their revenue so tht the top guys get a promotion,btohqsg
they did write in black and white,btohqsg
i think the service consultant dont know,btohqsg
In the eye of the law  it is the owner's duty to read the manual hence technically i would have to take liability for the misuse of battery,btohqsg
Had a fellow beetle  battery died cos forgotten to turn off head light. Cars of my era dont have ding ding ding warning sound when u didn't turn off head lights. Everything needs to be self-disciplined.,btohqsg
Is there even anyone that bothers to read the manual LOL-R,btohqsg

I watch in movies seem like yes leh,btohqsg
Scream loud loud Tourador got free 1 tyre? Like McDonald ice cream,btohqsg
I never bring decal leh. No windscreen to put.,btohqsg
so which is the part that causes the smoke,btohqsg
Maybe less than 20 mins can,btohqsg
lets see  will rim and road cause smoke or will tyre and road cause smoke,btohqsg
okay but seriously he shldnt have driven,btohqsg
Which is part of the wheel,btohqsg
he either playing mario kart or he trya revive his teammate,btohqsg
he shld use wearnes assist  free one,btohqsg
Or he a bank robber. Smoke out and exit,btohqsg
then go wearnes storage steal smore cars right,btohqsg
Rim and road will cause sparks!,btohqsg
so... IT MUST BE THE TYRE!!,btohqsg
Which is part of the wheel,btohqsg
rim and road is easily one of the most painful shit i see in my life,btohqsg
But Mr Se drive on wooden rims,btohqsg
Here's a PSA:Please wear your seatbelt everybody (Even when you are just driving down the MSCP to below your block)🥰-R,btohqsg
Whether in the front or the back,btohqsg
volvo dont wear seatbelt handbrake wont disengage,btohqsg
I come of my house  I don’t say.. I’m leaving my bedroom  I say .. I’m leaving my house. Even though the bedroom is part of the house,btohqsg
But he cares for your life Pak Imran,btohqsg
Yes because some blocks below have no road between mscp and the block itself. So can get quite bumpy 😊,btohqsg
Also Pak Imran  please look at what Zenvo did recently,btohqsg
But yes in all seriousness  seat belt is a must,btohqsg
Fun fact! There are times that not wearing a seatbelt helped someone survived an accident,btohqsg
speaking of which  what do yall think about using an ipad mini in the car?-R,btohqsg
Those instances are much fewer in numbers than when seatbelts saved people,btohqsg
The chances are low but never zero,btohqsg
Only when rolling down a mountain or into a river did not wearing a seatbelt help people quickly jump out,btohqsg
I’m sure I’ll win the next one….right?,btohqsg
how do you mount it ah?,btohqsg
I would rather have a proper head unit with steering mounted controls or haptic feedback touch sensitive buttons to use than an ipad mini,btohqsg
powerrr. Yours is cellular + wifi or wifi only?-R,btohqsg
It’s the mounting behind that needs to be strong too,btohqsg
Can play movie on the move all,btohqsg
Still control only volume or next song only,btohqsg
So i bought the portable wifi device snd got a sim card with data only plan,btohqsg
Or you could just mobile hotspot from your phone,btohqsg
This was what I was thinking too AHHAHA-R,btohqsg
Not that bad  iphone to ipad still ok,btohqsg
the wifi device not expensive ah?-R,btohqsg
By buying another data plan instead of upgrading the only you already have,btohqsg
Like I can watch youtube or netflix without worrying about my data,btohqsg
Tomorrow then the netlix will on,btohqsg
I’d rather get an ipad anyways,btohqsg
Can use it for other things too,btohqsg
Then can say your car is Zenvo,btohqsg
why you never get cellular ah? Circles SIM only is $10/mth only-R,btohqsg
Ya ah  i got the circles life,btohqsg
The cellular snd wifi so ex,btohqsg
How much the difference between buying cellular+wifi and wifi+wifi device,btohqsg
T’was a better choice to get the wifi only,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admini can show you if you ever in my area,btohqsg
Hard corner  pothole you name it,btohqsg
$228 difference for the iPad Mini-R,btohqsg

I pick R and J wash car over the other options 🤭,btohqsg
He needs engine oil more than wash,btohqsg
His car leaking all the time,btohqsg
What’s the need for engine oil if you’re only driving it for a few days and then go workshop,btohqsg
What's the point for a wash when the car is sitting and collecting dust in the shop,btohqsg
Because you can see R and J washing your car,btohqsg
Unless they do the oil change for you,btohqsg
I like how you're so optimistic that we won't mess it up -J,btohqsg
How does one mess up an oil change,btohqsg
Okay nvm no need to say,btohqsg
We all wanna see R & J wash our car,btohqsg

Can Try Li Hong Auto9027 6341Wcega Plaza Bukit Batok.Call and ask price first.,btohqsg
Toh guan  old Toh tuck so many,btohqsg
Basically servicing is like go see doctor lor,btohqsg

Lesson of Today: Read Owner’s Manual,btohqsg
If cannot find  google is your best friend,btohqsg
The oil specs are in there. Something W something.,btohqsg
for owner's manual  it doesn't matter wat year manufactured?,btohqsg

"her first question to me after i got the car ""can i drive to malaysia?""",btohqsg
Best is join fb group 👍🏼,btohqsg
You’re is probably 5W30 but pls check the manual.,btohqsg
There should be a section on routine maintenance.,btohqsg
I scared@awj_moodangry. Then don’t sell me anymore quail egg,btohqsg
Why are you still awake sir,btohqsg
So once confirm the specs  then go find good deal. Not the other way round.,btohqsg
I used to drive a 2017 kia,btohqsg
i kinda hesitate to get elantra cos it looked like taxi,btohqsg
Yes it is a very good car,btohqsg
For what you’re paying  it is good value for sure.,btohqsg
Time to buy back my kia,btohqsg
It doesn’t give me any problems,btohqsg
sorry I no money like you hehe,btohqsg
😮‍💨😮‍💨😮‍💨 you got good taste mam,btohqsg
"everytime i come in  there's always ""VTEC""",btohqsg

Usually oil change  oil filter change  cabin air filter if required+air filter of required,btohqsg
actually  japanese car makers starting to get  conservative  imo,btohqsg
Ya becareful of some they try to put in more unnecessary things,btohqsg
This one not in service as such  it's more of an add on  not all places do it,btohqsg
i like the car  i bought it from a wrong place,btohqsg
Like a new spoiler. Very sneaky. Suddenly appear in boot one. Like some cars.,btohqsg
Not part of manufacturer recco job list,btohqsg
Seu wanna stir shit ah 😏,btohqsg
Tyre rotation is part of it but many service centers don't do,btohqsg
And now you’re in the right place. Behind the steering wheel as it’s proud owner. 👍🏼,btohqsg
Singapore’s public transport is very good,btohqsg
And owning a car is a privilege here,btohqsg
If one can afford it  why not,btohqsg
You get your on space  go places much faster,btohqsg
we thot long and hard before committing. I stay quite far ... at pioneer,btohqsg
the nearest mrt will be 10 mins walk or 2 bus stops away,btohqsg

i'm trying to learn as much as i can,btohqsg
Erm I always at Joo Koon boss,btohqsg
My boss say stay Joo Koon more better.,btohqsg
u stay in a workshop ah?,btohqsg
Unlimited mrt ride being 4 only,btohqsg
Find a shop you trust and comfortable with and ok with the price. Don’t listen to everyone about this place cheaper etc etc. no end one. Some workshops get you in with ultra cheap oil pricing then “oh sorry… we found this squeak on your bolt here.. need change whole new suspension”,btohqsg
Can confirm top notch service and wont scam you,btohqsg
needs quality cabbage and chili powder,btohqsg
Some workshops just interested in changing parts and charging high labour costs,btohqsg
But never fixing the problem at hand,btohqsg
Some might say he is a wise man,btohqsg
I see everyone is trying to get that $20,btohqsg
Alamak .. I just like to read and learn from forums like you guys here. So one day when I go back to my hometown I can help others,btohqsg
I think they got the wrong person,btohqsg
Ok thanks for your very good advice Mr Se. Have a good night,btohqsg
i never note it down leh,btohqsg
i did drive to turf city to woodlands and then to joo koon and then back home,btohqsg
But don’t be shocked by the bill,btohqsg
carros center to joo koon then to home,btohqsg
So yes please find a good workshop and make sure to check all filters and their condition and ask the mechanic to give the car a once over to see if anything needs immediate attention. Obviously do this at a trusted workshop where they don't try to scam you  would be great if you can take a friend who is well versed with cars and can help you out the first time around,btohqsg
i ended up very tired after driving,btohqsg
Noone can hear you sing anyways,btohqsg
Some say he is the most knowledgeable with Kia,btohqsg
Try adjusting your seat position accordingly  maybe because you just started driving a bit nervous so your position not relaxed,btohqsg
Very common with first time drivers,btohqsg
Ok time to finish work for me,btohqsg
Just check what exactly they are asking you to change and run it by someone who is aware to see if they are scamming you or not,btohqsg
i watch them and i can learn,btohqsg
