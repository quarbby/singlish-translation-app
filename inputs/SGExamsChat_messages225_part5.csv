If you get referred via Polyclinic   you'll most likely get a consultant or a doctor training to be a specialist. Depends on your luck. If the doctor does not seem to be listening  be more insistent on a satisfactory answer  but don't be rude. Just voice out your question clearly: helps to prepare what questions you have on paper  before your appointment. Been a patient with NSC since the mid 1990s  so pretty familiar with what happens. DM me if you need additional advice about NSC  in general. My opinions only.,btohqsg
