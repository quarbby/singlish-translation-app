Hi all  for UOB visa signature Local spending is capped at $1000 or $2000 for 4mpd?,btohqsg
local and foreign combined cap $2k,btohqsg
So if i spend $2000 local via contactless  i will get 8000miles (4mpd x $2000)?,btohqsg
This is a reply to this question.,btohqsg
Sorry   but is this something new for uob visa? How is it that i did not know. Lol. Coz i just got uob ppv,btohqsg
Nope  it‚Äôs similar to UOB Preferred plat card,btohqsg
You can watch Chris' video on this.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs a good one of those 1.x% cashback card you guys use to catch all these small transactions? MariBank rejected my application lol,btohqsg
You can use uob vs if total spend is above 1k or uob lady if mcc is right,btohqsg
My smaller transactions are mainly dining (uob lady) or grocery (ntuc vouchers from heymax),btohqsg
The cap is $1 100. UOB PPV on milelion was mentioned.,btohqsg
For the worried folks  gotten this email. Withdrawn to my UOB acct on Tues at 1033am.,btohqsg
I wanted to make a CF X Heymax card for my SMRT travels. Is it still ok to make it? Since CF is under fire recently,btohqsg
It was pr disaster for CF but dust has settled. CF + heymax for public transport rides is still ok. Id keep just sufficient amount inside like any mobile wallet but that is just me.,btohqsg
Decent amount. That is good too. What do u use for public transport? Unless u're driving,btohqsg
Im using heymax + CF üòÅ. I have like 30$ inside.,btohqsg
Just wondering if anyone has encountered this issue before. I was trying to transfer miles from my Citibank credit card to my FFP program. Usually it takes around 2 working days to receive. It has now been more than 14 working days since I did that redemption and the miles are still not in,btohqsg
Contacted Citibank and they said they need another 3 to 5 working days to investigate,btohqsg
Contacted both citi and Eva both tell me to contact the other party  it's driving me nuts,btohqsg
Your names in Citi and Eva match?,btohqsg
Yes they do  I basically did the transfer on the same day but from 2 different citi cards because the miles don't pool. I received part of the miles but not the entire amount,btohqsg
I just want to redeem my miles but citi is making it so difficult üò≠,btohqsg
Nothing much we can do in this case. Have to wait for citi's reply.,btohqsg
Thats good. I withdraw on monday till now havent receive funds nor email,btohqsg
It will come. Just wait.But I understand the anxiety.,btohqsg
depends what time u withdrew on Monday ?,btohqsg
i did mine at 6pm Monday  just rcvd the email,btohqsg

Hi All  What‚Äôs the best option to pay school fees  insurance premiums  tax etc and earn miles / rewards - understand CF+Heymax provides 2 mpd for first $1k and 0.4 mpd thereafter. Can you please share details around cardup/ ipaymy (which is the best card to use) and HSBC EGA,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
I notice there still quite a numbers who use cc on wrong mcc. The other day I saw a lady use dbs woman Mastercard on contactless dining. Today I saw an elderly uncle use dbs live fresh on Koufu breakfast. Can‚Äôt blame them though. With so many nerds & changes happening so fast. There still a lot who just use it as no frill general spendings without caring for points..,btohqsg
Just received email from CFJust to let you know ‚Äì There was a slight negative change in your portfolio value from the point of withdrawal until you get your money. We value your trust  so while this isn‚Äôt standard practice  we‚Äôre covering the difference on just this occasion to ensure you have a seamless experience while our liquidity programme is paused.They said they will cover the difference wor.,btohqsg
hi guys.. question.. with the CF nerf meaning our tax can't be using CF card to pay off already right?,btohqsg
Even for below 20/50k also need to suffer negative change? Or only for the amount above the 3.3%/3% rates,btohqsg
I guess it all depends on the unit price√ónumber of units holding= total we receive.,btohqsg
The cashback usually is credited to your account in actual cash? After u tap out,btohqsg
rcvd same thing  but said the funds come in 5pm onwards today,btohqsg
Just received my funds. Out of goodwill they covering the differences,btohqsg
I have negative balancing item. I wonder can I withdraw this amount when I closed my account since this is clearly outperformed funds,btohqsg
That is how they earn money,btohqsg
I did received outperformed money previously. Only this time round they lock it,btohqsg
can I know you submitted withdraw request on 10th march?,btohqsg
Yup. I going to close the account see will I get remaining ‚Äúoutperformed‚Äù funds,btohqsg
I guess on outperformed funds they will charge fee as well  as per FAQ on CF,btohqsg
I just realised it‚Äôs for the whole year. Maybe I should wait until sept then close the account.,btohqsg

Anyone here has the OCBC infinity card and know if they will waive the annual fee if u only spend $500 a month (to qualify for the cc spend interest on 360 acct)?,btohqsg
This is annoying  I receive the same email at 2.30pm stating funds will be in a few hours time. It‚Äôs past 5pm  still waiting for my money‚Ä¶üò¥,btohqsg
Depends on the bank I guess. Mine is Trust Bank,btohqsg
