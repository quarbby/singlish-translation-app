I need to be funny to make up for my height,btohqsg
ok idk why but in JC it felt like average was taller,btohqsg
but uni i see everyone fucking tiny,btohqsg
All the tall genes go to certain ppl sia,btohqsg
I still salt my sis taller than me,btohqsg
dw i same height as you,btohqsg
my entire uni major batch i think less than 10% of guys at least 175,btohqsg
and most aren't even from sg...,btohqsg
average male height there is 182,btohqsg
and that's tallest in the world,btohqsg
i mean that's across the whole world,btohqsg
damn i have a longer than average hand,btohqsg
can type faster on phone with thin fingers yah,btohqsg
Smaller surface area = increased pressure when slapping someone,btohqsg
Same but apparently I type q fast,btohqsg
Why yes boss me when u r way older than meðŸ˜­,btohqsg
if i hold a wacom drawing pen drawing me holding hands how?,btohqsg
Guys if i nvr finish emath tys am i screwed,btohqsg
I got b4 for prelims but idk,btohqsg
Rlly?? Alot of my friends finished tys and did millions of papers and i feel so unprepared,btohqsg
I had to juggle h1 math and Emath,btohqsg
diff ppl got diff studying methods also,btohqsg
if ur studying the same way but it doesnt work,btohqsg
also too much practice isnt good if u get burnout,btohqsg
tbh i did like 8 years of the TYS and my marks doesn't rlly improve for emath sue to careless mistakes varying a lot so I don't rlly care anymore,btohqsg
Its more of i nvr finish cos of procrastination but i feel fine but looking at everyone else i feel like im doing too late and its too much to hope for an A,btohqsg
"what I did learn was that certain questions I couldn't do so I managed to learn how to do them  so ig that's the ""quality""? idk",btohqsg
if ur last few practice papers have been hitting the A,btohqsg
like you roughly know ur own abilities,btohqsg
and whether u actually need more practice to improve,btohqsg
I dont usually time or anything,btohqsg
Is it hard to get a b3/4 for e math?,btohqsg
As long as ik how to do then its enough?,btohqsg
As in like i got the qn correct,btohqsg
and u dont spend like 10min thinking for every question,btohqsg
i mean timing is always good because there's a big difference between knowing how to do in 1 min,btohqsg
but if you feel like your pace is ok,btohqsg
But i think the base expectation is to finish all sciences and maths?,btohqsg
ok idk about finishing all of them,btohqsg
Rly need a clear head tmr,btohqsg
it's not the time to let your thoughts get distracted about your prep,btohqsg
its not an expectation per se,btohqsg
Also funny I said go sleep,btohqsg
so sleep and go do your best,btohqsg
When I go the paper tmr too,btohqsg
there's a non zero chance you'll be awake before i sleep,btohqsg
honestly dunnid compare w others that much,btohqsg
I think if ik that alot of pple nvr finish then i wldnt feel as crap,btohqsg
some people need more practice than others,btohqsg
some don't need that much at all lol,btohqsg
