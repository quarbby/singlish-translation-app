The common answer is probably Sec 5 -> JC -> Uni,btohqsg
But Poly -> Uni is viable too,btohqsg
5N into JC is usually quite low,btohqsg
Depending on your current academic ability and stuff like that  you would pick your path accordingly,btohqsg
Say u r a god at maths and chem  then u would probably want to go to JC through sec 5 cause JC rewards being very good at academics,btohqsg
But if u r not the academic sort  and prefer learning through application  you would want to go through poly instead,btohqsg
I mean I come from a neighbourhood Sec Sch into a neighbourhood JC. Both the number of Sec 5 in my Sec Sch that ended up in JC  and the number of people in my JC that were in NA is quite low.,btohqsg
Not say don’t have  but low.,btohqsg
What do you want to know about it? I can help answer for 5Na qns as I'm formally an N level student. I went to sec 5 and rn in IB,btohqsg
I meant it as a response to ‘smooth route to uni’,btohqsg
Most people will tell you to go JC if u want to go Uni,btohqsg
i guess it depends on what u wna do and how well did you do academically,btohqsg
They say 70% local U intake is JC (iirc)  but they don’t tell you how many in JC don’t make it to Uni,btohqsg
My class only 7 made it to jc others go poly haha,btohqsg
Why are you Chem Math Geog guy now,btohqsg

Oh I was trying to help my sis find some viable options. She slacked off primary school so she paid the price. I want to help her and I can see shes working harder,btohqsg

Nope as a brother I want to help her,btohqsg
What level your sis in now?,btohqsg
To be frank shes not academically inclined but Singapore emphasises so much on ____. So I am trying to help her get the best?,btohqsg
Does she know what she wanna do yet?,btohqsg
Is she aware of courses that would allow her to pursue that career?,btohqsg
Shes in NA  so PFP is limited,btohqsg
Ok  if not PFP or Sec 5 then there’s only ite left,btohqsg
You do not start by asking her what scheme she wanna aim for  you start with the end in mind. Where does she want to be  then chart the route there through the schemes.,btohqsg
This is how I helped my Brother. He was like I want to go PFP  I ask what course he say don’t know  just say teacher say PFP is easier than Sec 5. You want to help her  help her find her end goal not the route to nowhere.,btohqsg
