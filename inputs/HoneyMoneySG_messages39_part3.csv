if you are talking about those no salary crediting  yes but EGA is complex for newbie  if not you can consider SCB Esaver  UOB One  OCBC 360 etc,btohqsg

Hey for the Citi Rewards + Amaze.Is the correct procedure for online transaction to use it to get the physical Amaze Card and add it to Apple Pay to PayWave / Apple Pay stuff online  and then in the Insterem App  to put the Citi Rewards as the Card to charge to?Also  would FavePay QR Code using Citi rewards card also count towards the 10x rewards?,btohqsg
Amaze cant be added to apple pay  but can google pay.I have not used Favepay with CRMC. But it works with my shopback,btohqsg
I see. So for PayWave at restaurants  the Citi Rewards card wonâ€™t be ideal since thereâ€™s no 10 x rewards  right? ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Oh wait  I could just use the physical card right,btohqsg
"the ""standard"" practise is once you link CRMC to Amaze  you just leave the CRMC at home and bring your Amaze card out",btohqsg
but but  I need to say something. certain F&B will give special discount to the bills if you using a specific bank CC. However  I have not seen it happening to citi bank personally   I dont dine in restaurants,btohqsg
I see  thanks for that.Another question  does Spotify and online subscriptions like iCloud count all as online purchases?,btohqsg
