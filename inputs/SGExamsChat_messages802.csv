Mediazone is a anti-putinist Russian media organisationMediazone confirmed in Feb 2024  49k russian soldiers have diedZelensky confirmed in Feb 2024  31k Ukraine soldiers have died,btohqsg
My exam is in 11 hours,btohqsg
How do I find the range and domain of a function ?!,btohqsg
I believe both numbers are understated,btohqsg
Draw the graph of the functionDomain is the set of values x can takeRange is the set of values y can take,btohqsg
I mean by the numbers right now  it's alr the largest conflict with the most death toll since the Korean war,btohqsg
sometimes they are reported as civilians death to deflate the numbers,btohqsg
Either way as the number stands now  it's the largest death toll from any war in the last 40 yrs,btohqsg
both do not care as long as they emerge victorious to satisfy their ego,btohqsg
Washington times not reliable at all,btohqsg
At the end of day to both it's just statistics,btohqsg
Both intelligence organization in the US and UK came to the same conclusion,btohqsg
US and UK estimate Russia deaths is like Russia estimates Ukraine deaths,btohqsg
Sounds like US intelligence is UK,btohqsg
They took parts of what Putin have said and did maths,btohqsg
Why the fuck is there 34 pre-readings for one lesson,btohqsg
So they basically did maths to derive at the 300k mark previously  now they redid maths and has actually gotten to a number closer to half a million,btohqsg
Add up it's nearly half a million,btohqsg
Which is exactly what the maths derived,btohqsg
So actually the 100k figure was accurate,btohqsg
When I meant half a million I meant casualties not death,btohqsg
Cause this what the maths means,btohqsg
Personell I don't think it means military deaths solely,btohqsg
But the conclusions derived at casualties not death,btohqsg
WW2 Soviet Union 8 668 000 to 11 400 000,btohqsg
Cause if 500k soldiers actually died,btohqsg
WW2 Germany 4 440 000 to 5 318 000,btohqsg
But you forgot that is soviet union  that is 15 countries. Now it's just russia,btohqsg
most of the troops still from Russia part,btohqsg
The soviet.union had a population of 290 million before it broke off in Dec 1991Russia's population in 1992 was 147-148 million,btohqsg
Anyways tldr  50k+ Russian soldiers have officially died  30k+ ukraine soldiers have officially died.Most military deaths occurred between these two countries in 4 years than the US/UK/New Zealand/China/India military deaths combined in the last 40 years,btohqsg
The majority of the losses  excluding POWs  were ethnicRussians(5 756 000)  followed by ethnicUkrainians(1 377 400).,btohqsg
China and India and UK and New Zealand do not have war in last 40 years? Only USA ?,btohqsg
Yea so the safe bet would be to say just over 2/4 of the military deaths came from Russia not 3/4 adamant,btohqsg
still more than the amount of Germany,btohqsg
This military conflict between Russia and Ukraine has been brutal,btohqsg
Who does New Zealand conflict with ? Australia?,btohqsg
Tbh nothing but just brings to scale of how major the Russia Ukraine war is,btohqsg
Most wars start because of unresolved differences but gets prolonged because of undiscovered benefits,btohqsg
Yea...invading parties tend to discover things in countries they invade which will more than likely prolong war  america went to the middle east for terrorism but stayed for resourcesThats why they remained after killing Osama and remained after killing baghdadi,btohqsg
went for terrorism? american military contractors are third parties?,btohqsg
"I mean look at almost every country then sent their soldier to the middle east  it's always under the guise of ""safekeeping"" if it's not safe keeping from terrorism or harm  then what they conducting safekeeping on?",btohqsg
Btw the person that started the whole fiasco in Russia Ukraine since 2014 is a guy that started off liking Putin but in the end hated him.He was jailed then arrested in russia,btohqsg
A A-Wol Russian commander that invaded Ukraine with his team without permission or order from Putin. He went in and was trapped  Putin then sent in soldiers to bail him and his team out.Later on he rallied against Putin and was arrested by Putin for extremism,btohqsg
The cause  the purpose and actually the whole war is stupid in itself.,btohqsg
Probably the dream of every alcoholic,btohqsg
Can get drunk without having to buy alcohol,btohqsg
u dun like me being online isit,btohqsg
@Iamsuperfedupwithyoulater I find your Dopplerdanger then you know,btohqsg
I find a orange ping pong ball can alr  that is yokk,btohqsg
She is in love with who...hmn,btohqsg
Gude is a bird right? So this one must be bf,btohqsg
I mean which one fits an egg yolk more,btohqsg
Still the bottom  the top looks more like a tangerine,btohqsg
oh ya there is also terence,btohqsg
Who did the a level exam today?,btohqsg
Which exam board’s papers do they use in Singapore?,btohqsg
May I just say the tate bros are such comic relief during periods of stress,btohqsg
Everyone check out their clips for therapy,btohqsg
You sat for the papers in Singapore or the UK?,btohqsg
The only UK GCE I sat for was the O level Econs paper since in Singapore moe/seab does not set their own local version,btohqsg
Oh which exam board? I read online that Edexcel is easier for math,btohqsg
I still don’t understand what’s the rationale behind having multiple exam boards,btohqsg
to profit. Or sit the easier variant of the paper to get A*.UK A-Levels have OCR AQA EdExcel Cambrdige,btohqsg
An LTA enforcement officer was killed while chasing a fleeing motorcyclist on the SLE.The 18-year-old rider he was believed to be pursuing was arrested on charges of:- Failing to stop when ordered to- dangerous driving- driving without a valid licence and insurance coverage- possession of scheduled weapons- suspected drug-related activities:https://cna.asia/3R9jR0g,btohqsg
Maybe sg authorities should have a no pursuit policy,btohqsg
What's the point of chasing knowing full well they can catch the license plate  just inform all checkpoints of said license plate. Trace cameras and throw a public alert,btohqsg
so that he won't be a public hazard to others?,btohqsg
I dont know about you  but forging license plates are a thing,btohqsg
Yea I know that's why I say throw public alert for rider,btohqsg
Idk but to me the hazard he pose to himself running is substantially way more than the hazard he pose to others around him. Especially weaving through big trucks like he did while escapingHe continues  it's only a matter of time he dies to his actions,btohqsg
anyone here knows where to find job shadowing opportunities,btohqsg
What's the point of chasing someone that does not want to not only stop but choose to go above and beyond in order to get away. If he is not stopping  so the chaser is expecting him to crash. Isn't itThen what they expect  crash alr..oh close two/three lanes of expressway for hrs. Then arrest the person. Which part of this scenario is beneficial to people that don't care about their safety or others,btohqsg
Because there is a possibility he might crash into a school bus killing 20 people potentially instead of that 1 officer.,btohqsg
Then what makes you think the outcome could be any different engaging in a chase.Where speeds are likely higher and intensity to push the limits become stronger knowing full well there is a person right behind you.,btohqsg
I think the outcome would be different because the officer is a personnel that I trust will act and actively intervene in good faith for the sole purpose of order and public safety.,btohqsg
Need write paper 1 english article and my brain aint working,btohqsg
If you were wanted by authority.You won't be running full speed through traffic if you see that the authoritive Figure decided to give up chasing you 15 cars behind. Because you don't want to be spotted by another authoritive figure down the roadYou will most definitely be running full speed through traffic if the authoritive figure was chasing you 15 cars behind and not slow down if you see another authoritive figure down the road since you knew one was alr actively chasing you,btohqsg
"Why add onto the ego of the rider by introducing another layer of ""escaping the police"" to feed his ego even more",btohqsg
You are assuming rationality on the part of the criminal whom already by virtue of being chased has proven if anything they aren't conforming to societal laws and rules.,btohqsg
Just like how I am not assuming logic on your part by virtue of your retarded answers,btohqsg
"It does not matter if they aren't conforming to societal laws but it undeniable to the fact that ""escaping the police in a chase"" is fuel to the fire to any criminal",btohqsg
So why add fuel to the fire,btohqsg
They live for the adrenaline of engaging in a chase by authority  they yearn to outrun them...it's not the fact to escape them  it's just the fact to show that they have the capability of escaping them,btohqsg
So there is no virtue signaling because I'm outlining literally what is a known fact,btohqsg
And you are assuming they do it for fun based on what? Your own experience breaking the rules?,btohqsg
Because they don't do anything to hide the fact they are speeding???,btohqsg
Like literally do you honestly think people in Singapore run from the police to actually escape the police for a decade?,btohqsg
No..they just want to engage in the thrill of a chase  of driving fast.,btohqsg
The definition of “Rashly” according to the penal code.26E.—(1)  Whoever does any act knowing that there isa real risk that a particular circumstance exists or will exist is said to do that act rashly in respect of that particular circumstance  if it would have been unreasonable to have taken that risk.[15/2019](2)  Whoever does any act knowing that there is a real risk that an effect will be caused is said to do that act rashly in respect of that effect  if it would have beenunreasonable to have taken that risk.[15/2019](3)  Where doing an act rashly is a fault element of an offence  that fault element is also established where that act is doneintentionally or knowingly.,btohqsg
Unreasonable is literally baked into the system and the law and SOP assumes irrationality on the part of the offender,btohqsg
I don't understand why you think what I said is a assumption of anything,btohqsg
They just wantHow do u know this to be true? Are you the offender u have done what decades of research in criminology could never do. You managed to crack the definitive reason for the commission of a crime. Someone should give you a medal for your breakthrough.,btohqsg
Ok then can you give another reason other than thrill? Most are certainly not escaping because they don't want to be caught for crimes they may have done,btohqsg
I have just explain it to you. We have no definitive explanation on why criminals act it is also written into the definition itself that a rash act is against the ideal of rationale itself.,btohqsg
"It's not a breakthrough  it's just that they can't state the reason as ""thrill""",btohqsg
I feel like you have achieved a mastery being the epitome of what circular reasoning entails. The definition of thrill itself just shifts the term to another word of the English lexicon and we end up exactly where we started just this time u have wasted my time and everyone's sanity in having to read your pointless twattle mixed with unintelligible gobbledegook in a pointless attempt to support a flawed argument from it's conception.,btohqsg
idk i tot the guy run away cuz he has possession of drugs 💀,btohqsg
You literally accused me of assuming the rationality of someone that could and would run from the law when all I mentioned was that you don't have to look into law to understandChasing someone always make that person run harder and faster irregardless of whatever other reasoning they have,btohqsg
Idk why you have to bring the rationality of the individual or his reasonings. No matter how you see it  someone chasing will always add danger to any situation,btohqsg
And you are here assuming that someone chasing could add more safety than danger to this particular scenario,btohqsg
Going to be afternoon soon wonder what I should eat for lunch,btohqsg
Yes that could be a reason but all I'm saying is if the cop had not chased...then the only person that was most likely to get hurt was the crim himself,btohqsg
I never once mentioned others will never get hurt  I just said that he himself is the most likely to get hurt,btohqsg
A tp officer literally outlines it,btohqsg
The officer literally knew that authority was a reason which could result in someone running faster and harder,btohqsg
I don't understand why you facepalming tbh  all I basically said was.Sg should have a no pursuit policy because pursuits in general puts everyone around them in more danger for benefits that is negligible at best.Idk why y'all have to accuse me of assumptions  throw random facts at me etc. I don't understand in which part of my sentence requires me to know law or any part of crimes or how criminals think,btohqsg
every situation is different  blanket policies does nobody good,btohqsg
not everything in the world is linear and simple,btohqsg
Every situation is different but what other outcomes can you expect from a pursuit in sg,btohqsg
It's either the pursuit person dies  innocent person dies or criminal dies,btohqsg
have u ever thought of a situation whrnobodydies?,btohqsg
Yes but only a minority end up that way. Minority also end up with deaths. Most end up with injuries,btohqsg
it's like saying one firefighter die = we shldnt fight fires anymore,btohqsg
Na bro it's like saying a firefighter should never die because they can just avoid the bad fires.,btohqsg
aiya tldr let the professional make decisions,btohqsg
if you're not a professional then you're just a sinkie with a probably rubbish opinion,btohqsg
Exactly lmao I trust the officer to make a good faith decision based on the situation,btohqsg
Yes  tbh sg alr has a no pursuit policy. It's at the discretion of authority if they want to chase someone,btohqsg
Whatever I say I will never based it on opinion  it's based on facts and past records.If facts and past records prove me wrong then I will say I'm wrong. Idk why y'all keep thinking what I say are opinions,btohqsg
I literally told y'all so many times but y'all keep assuming what I say is opinions,btohqsg
so whr is your fact saying that no pursuit is an official TP policy?,btohqsg
ok ya so that's your opinion right,btohqsg
Yes that was a opinion but this was the statement that y'all keep thinking is a opinion and Harper on it,btohqsg
double underscore on both side of wtv u wna italics,btohqsg
When in fact that was a fact,btohqsg
and what's your source that this is a fact,btohqsg
I literally outlines it in the first para,btohqsg
So you want a source where it says that one of the outcomes of someone being chased is crashing,btohqsg
"a source that says ppl that police chase ""does not want to not only stop but choose to go above and beyond in order to get away""",btohqsg
because LTA's own telegram channels show ppl stopping when TP ask them to stop,btohqsg
In fact I asking my friend rn,btohqsg
"I literally said ""the point of chasing someone who""... I said that because I know y'all gonna spin it like I meant everybody getting chase by cops",btohqsg
ya then that's an opinion what,btohqsg
so what facts are you talking about,btohqsg
u say your first para outlines the source that it is a fact,btohqsg
The outcome of a scenario that is highlighted is literally crashing,btohqsg
please explain from where did you source that fact,btohqsg
can u show me a dataset that says that,btohqsg
So you telling me that someone that goes above and beyond does not increase their chance of crashing?,btohqsg
Do I need a fact to support that statement?,btohqsg
no I'm asking u for a fact that ppl who kena chase will want to escape,btohqsg
ppl whom tp chase also alw stop what,btohqsg
Iknowthat the ppl TP chase alw stop,btohqsg
So they want to be captured ah  cause what E120 is telling me that people who kena chase according to law just do it because of nothing the law can definitively define,btohqsg
I am saying that they want to be captured,btohqsg
What I said in your context is basically people who not only get chased...but go above and beyond,btohqsg
The fact they get chase does not make any difference  it's what they do in the chase that dictates the fact they will crash,btohqsg
Or dictates what they will do in a chase,btohqsg
ya so is that an opinion or a fact,btohqsg
increase chance of crash -> ???,btohqsg
If you go above and beyond  yes you will increase chance of crash. You don't need to fact check that,btohqsg
ya so that's not a fact la that's still an opinion,btohqsg
It's not rocket science  idk why such a simple statement can be spun so many different ways,btohqsg
dunnid to fact check doesn't automatically make it a fact,btohqsg
"How is this and ""dangerous driving increases more rate of crashes"" diff",btohqsg
Going above and beyond is literally being more dangerous on the road context,btohqsg
"ambulance and pumpers can aso go ""above and beyond"" and still be safe",btohqsg
wtv la u think what u want,btohqsg
"I literally highlighted the target ""People who gets chased""...not ambulance not fire truck drivers etc",btohqsg
Y'all like to keep spinning random narratives that always throw a simple statements out of context...I know lah y'all hate generalisations but if you even took a second to think. Most of my generalisations are literally common sense,btohqsg
thanks for the morning banter it was fun,btohqsg
I hope you keep living in the bubble of generalisations,btohqsg
I ended up eating mutton curry... what the fuck I missed out on the fun,btohqsg

Or u can take a ferry from Dover,btohqsg
i did not take 161 just to be accused of not being rp kid,btohqsg
That jingle is living in my head rent free,btohqsg
"thinking about an alternate timeline where Creative is a major player in the console business:some ideas for what their entries were:3rd generation: CubicCreative entered the gaming market in 1984 with an MSX-compatible console/""learning computer"" called the Cubic. It was a success in Southeast Asia and a niche success in  Australia and Taiwan but never saw release elsewhere except for a rare production run for America based on the MSX2+ standard as a test market release that now fetches high prices on the collector market. In 1986  a mid-cycle upgrade based on the MSX2 called the Cubic 99 came out. Many games for the Cubic were ports of British ZX Spectrum games.Notable games:- Metal Gear (separate localisation of the game  considered the best localisation)- Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake (the last game ever released for the system)- The Legend of the Condor Heroes4th generation: Cubic 16In 1990  the Cubic 16 was released  and Creative entered the North American and European market. This system had a niche as a host for smaller developers who couldn't afford the high licensing fees of Nintendo or Sega  especially in Europe and Southeast Asia. This kept it moderately successful  though definitely a distant third place to Nintendo and Sega outside Southeast Asia.Notable games:- The Return of the Condor Heroes- The Legendary Swordsman5th generation: 3DO/Creative HyperCubic/Panasonic REALFor the 5th generation  Creative bought out The 3DO Company in the hopes of getting a bigger foothold in the American market  changing its direction from being an open standard to a single console produced by Panasonic for NTSC regions and Creative for PAL regions. It was a bigger success than in OTL as a result outside of Japan and South Korea  where its high price made it a commercial failure. It sold for 199 USD right out the gate  making it cheaper  albeit less powerful  than its competitors. For this generation  there notably were no wuxia RPGs due both to technical limitations and a bit of received wisdom that overly ""cheena"" games did not sell well in the West.Notable games:The Need for SpeedMetal Gear 3PolicenautsGexVR Man6th generation: 3DO M2/HyperCubic M2Shortly before the start of this generation  Panasonic and Creative ended their 15-year partnership  with Panasonic selling their entire console division to Creative. The console was released in 1999 to some success  though barely so outside of Southeast Asia.Notable games:Mr MidnightPower CrystalEscape from LATop GunIMSA RacingThe Heaven Sword and Dragon SaberAny other ideas?",btohqsg
I know there is but the line is blurry hence the discretion I mentioned. factors like what constitute a pursuit and what kind of crimes allows a pursuit are both at the discretion of the officers chasing.If a officer decides that the car he wants does not see him despite lights or sirens and let him exist to the nearest offramp to the nearest gas station..there is no pursuit. But other officers may see that the moment the car leaves for the off ramp and not stop. They call that a pursuit.So It varies from sit to sit  the blanket statement I'm basically stating is that the moment a driver knows they are being actively chased Danger will inevitably increase for all parties involved. This generalisation I make is literally factual by pure road statistics,btohqsg
Does not take a rocket scientist to know that a driver is unlikely to check every decision behind the wheel he makes against the backdrop of safety...because now every decision they make is on the backdrop of escape. Hence why danger increases,btohqsg
Pleasure? No. But I say cause why not,btohqsg
We have gone full circle a forwarded message of a forwarded message,btohqsg
Forwarded messageFrom YTI do not wish to engage in this conversation,btohqsg
Whatever man y'all do you  not my place to influenced y'all. I just say what I know to be as factual as possible. Y'all misinterpret it also whatever,btohqsg
Can we bring back bedok? He would provide an excellent response to dis,btohqsg
Tf he going to do  I literally taunted him to mute me like 6000 times,btohqsg
It’s a shrine which worships war criminals tho,btohqsg
It’s like as if Germany build a shrine to worship Hitler,btohqsg
He was funny as a jester his yapping could drown that shit out. I prefer NS ASA talk than that,btohqsg
Apparently we are better than Cornell,btohqsg
No that's literally what y'all think  what's so impressive about that.Bedok was mentioned so I just replied that nothing more.,btohqsg
At least i can finally say i graduated from a top 15 uni in the world,btohqsg
Dun jinx it still got 1-2 more years,btohqsg

Not that i want to because im already dying with 17au,btohqsg
Oh I am almost guaranteed an overload to 24AUs for soon I can add a second major in Philosophy at the back of my degree,btohqsg
I maintened >4.2 tho so I get another 4 AU on top of that at least for the next STARs,btohqsg
It seems copable if you have the self discipline of a god,btohqsg
Na I am doing 28 soon.,btohqsg
i think my fren  told me he from RP 3.83 also cannot go ntu and nus,btohqsg
It would be 2.5 but FYP is forced if I wanna overload,btohqsg
Your ass would graduate faster than me,btohqsg
Yes it would be hilarious and I wanted that cuz it's funny af,btohqsg
Its ok im a survivor in ntu,btohqsg
Did u see the Aespa tickets selling rn,btohqsg
To buying cat 1 standing tickets from resellers,btohqsg

Probably not scalper per se bah,btohqsg
Person wanted to sell his tickets to upgrade to a better one,btohqsg
But +50 from og price is not terrible in my books,btohqsg
Just the price to pay to see aespa,btohqsg
I planning to try for the Macau one,btohqsg
Hell no ain't buying from resellers,btohqsg
If only they went to malaysia,btohqsg
Then at least can try that also,btohqsg
I only have 13 dollars to my name now sir,btohqsg

If they renew  there could still be hope for another world tour but,btohqsg
Taeyeon is also radio silence too especially for tours.,btohqsg
Actually wtf is wrong with SM these days,btohqsg

I am pretty sure he didn't come from Hiroshima.,btohqsg
Oh right apologies  he graduated from a military academy in Hiroshima,btohqsg
He basically caused the downfall of his own school,btohqsg
Ever thought both was related? It was a military target..,btohqsg
irony would be the general writing a paper on atomic science that gets used to make the bomb,btohqsg
Technically the general was learning skills on defending his country in Hiroshima but what he was taught was ineffective enough which led to Hiroshima getting bombedThat's a stretch tho,btohqsg
when an action creates the opposite effect than expected  we have irony. In this sense the action did not create the intended effect  but did not reverse it either.A clearer case would be the stuff he learnt from hiroshima academy speeding up the use of the atomic bomb. Ineffective training as you said would be a greyer case indeed,btohqsg
That's basically what I'm going for  if he was born in Hiroshima. That would be a coincidence,btohqsg
fair point  I see where you're going with it,btohqsg
Both set of planes..the enola gay was back for round 2💀,btohqsg
An 88-year-old man was arrested at 1am on Wednesday for the murder of a 74-year-old woman in a Bukit Panjang flat.https://cna.asia/3wTVhcT,btohqsg
"A minibus driver involved in a chain collision that killed a motorcyclist is appealing against his jail term and driving ban  saying he was a victim of being in the ""wrong place at the wrong time"".The motorcyclist  who had fallen on the road after being side-swiped by a taxi  was getting up when the minibus collided with him:https://cna.asia/3x32MOB",btohqsg
1 search of the word poly and gpa and death occurs,btohqsg
I mean Poly and Uni exams are much direct and easier. Compared to the strict marking scheme of O-levels/A-Levels.,btohqsg
“not trying to be” well this guy clearly is,btohqsg
Blud pulled the extra 10 marks from his asshole,btohqsg
I legit suspect it's a satire thing lmao,btohqsg
When they preface it by saying not trying to be u know damn well they are about to say the most paradoxically moronic shit ever,btohqsg
I bet his psle score is how much ice Milo cost,btohqsg
With inflation these days that might be a complement,btohqsg
Probably his PSLE score is the price of a postage stamp,btohqsg
This is random but maybe i shld hv followed my dad’s advice to go australia study pharmacy instead of singapore,btohqsg
When i actually had a PR💀,btohqsg
So i wun be paying foreigner rate,btohqsg
I tot you slipped into the unknown void liao,btohqsg
When i said i wanted to do pharmacy  my parents told me it will be a btr life working in australia,btohqsg
Australia coz i could qualify for a pr,btohqsg
Australia the entry would be easier,btohqsg
Definitely not as pricely as foreigner rate,btohqsg
Yeah they can actually Prescribe medications there lmao,btohqsg
But my english dk can make it anot,btohqsg
here doctor still hv so much power,btohqsg
My dad had a pr so he could get me one easily + they need pharmacists,btohqsg
It comes w its cost too  like higher burden on urself…,btohqsg
But i know there definitely pay higher than here,btohqsg
For pharm yes la but u gotta add in the mobility too,btohqsg
The thing between me n doing my degree at australia then was my dad did not assure me means the whole family go,btohqsg
what is this morning career talk,btohqsg
SGexams chat is finally in a germane topic,btohqsg
Coz my brain wanna baoza alr,btohqsg
wait I read what's going on lol,btohqsg
Actually if u wan u can still do postgraduate there what,btohqsg
The thing is now i hv a pharmacy degree here alr  i think i need to find a way to get local license before considering overseas,btohqsg
No but securing a freaking job is freaking me out for the past few months,btohqsg
And I desperately need that practicing license,btohqsg
Unless i completely give up on pursuing clinical,btohqsg
that one I cannot help alr but rly good luck,btohqsg
idk why it's so hard ngl,btohqsg
Don't u need 12 months of practice experience for the SPC license,btohqsg
As in go to pharma industry,btohqsg
U can still do research or industry imo,btohqsg
Biotechnology is an industry sg has been tryna cultivate for damn long,btohqsg
But i think reg affairs need a license,btohqsg
The sucess of that is a separate issue,btohqsg
Coz still hv my extended fam so i just cant imagine ppl solo migrate,btohqsg
My dad keep telling me i hv to go first coz im the most likely one to get the PR but that is not certainly telling me they will go  ltr they abandon me,btohqsg
I think Guardian and Watsons for industry easier probably,btohqsg
My brain not braining but yes,btohqsg
It is ok  it is still pretty early,btohqsg
Isn't there a set list of approved training institutions,btohqsg
Meanwhile jpn is doing some magic to me coz im physically stronger n active in jpn  always feeling unwell in sg,btohqsg
isit u will miss them so udw go alone,btohqsg
Gotta be attached to one of em for 12 months either ways,btohqsg
Even the dr cant explain my symptoms,btohqsg
Jpn i need to brush up my japanese first + i hv not bumped into a pharmacist there💀💀,btohqsg
N it is cooler and colder there,btohqsg
I was in Tokyo/Kyoto over summer,btohqsg
Their winter is fucked for that,btohqsg
That is why i go in spring / summer,btohqsg
i just came back this morn,btohqsg
Why would Irwen be a chicken,btohqsg
The only thing not gd is the stairs / slopes and some toilets are really small,btohqsg
ya the stairs are not it,btohqsg
What's with Irwen and making him looking like a snack,btohqsg
He alr is a snack itself ;),btohqsg
There are no train exits w fully escalator,btohqsg
Walking down the steps and slopes w an injured R knee was kinda 💀💀,btohqsg
I don't think I ever visited mainland Japan ngl,btohqsg
I visited japan 3y in a row,btohqsg
Ok in fact the interval between this n the last was 5m lol,btohqsg
U mean kansai / tokyo area?,btohqsg
No like Kyushu and Kansai and even Hokkaido,btohqsg
Never visited those parts of Japan.,btohqsg
Oh which parts of japan did u go,btohqsg
The winds are damn strong from the sea waves,btohqsg
he said it multiple times in comment sections,btohqsg
then he lament about how its not good enough which would make the sge discord  go crazy and scold him,btohqsg
i mean i can understand why he thinks its a bad score,btohqsg
I don’t think other ppl should as well,btohqsg
i mean the guy is infamous for his comments on the reddit so just let him be,btohqsg
Why care about someone else’s grades,btohqsg
I would be happy with that score back then lol,btohqsg
248 can go pretty good schools alr,btohqsg
because the one teaching is good at interview but do not understand why their students struggle with it,btohqsg
I wouldn't  so to each their own I guess. I'm gonna get flamed if I said this on the discord  but I was actually disappointed with my score back then (I could go to any sec school in Singapore with my score except the boys schools),btohqsg
then that's not a good teachefb,btohqsg
Yeah people have their own opinions and standards,btohqsg
i heard that many interviews are not rly about finding out what you know technically but to see if they will get along with you/you can fit in their culture,btohqsg
U shouldn’t really care about other that either,btohqsg
Because ur resume alr told them whatever they need to know about you in terms of skills,btohqsg
I know that guy is trolling but psle actually used to be upon 400,btohqsg
Actually wait the T score thing is such that there is no max mark so I’m wrong but ppl did get around 400 last time before the calculation was changed,btohqsg
From 1973 to 1985  the T-score for the first and second languages were multiplied by two.Hence  the PSLE aggregate score of students from the 1970s to 1980s would probably have been much higher than most of the scores we see today.For instance  in 1983  the top-scoring studentgot an aggregate score of 420 that year.According to a report byThe Business Times the double weightage policy was scrapped following studies that showed that streaming of pupils into secondary courses would be more accurate if language subjects were given equal weightage as mathematics and science.,btohqsg
depends. there’s behavioural interviews and then there’s technical interviews,btohqsg
you can fluff out your resume but technical interviews zoom into the specifics of what they need,btohqsg
True cause some jobs are like you dont need a specific technical skillset but as long as can handle projects and work well w others you can do the jobThen got some specialised jobs that require very specific skills but dont need to socialise   like for example the person who cleans surgical equipment  that one you can have 0 social skills but as long as you can get the job done youre hired,btohqsg
That one is more of an aptitude test liao what imo,btohqsg
i mean some companies will get you to do it ahead of time and send it in,btohqsg
some is on the spot ask you problems,btohqsg
Either ways its an assignment of some sort to test your aptitude and what they are seeking for,btohqsg
Idk I haven't rlly worked in MNCs before so I am not sure as to that process,btohqsg
I do know it's a lot of filtering most of the time and very sisyphean,btohqsg
Go thru like 3 rounds just to be rejected like bruh,btohqsg
In my mnc I genuinely have confusion of how some ppl in my com get hired,btohqsg
i mean welcome to life lol,btohqsg
Like how they act  how they ptray themselves will never workout or even be tolerable for a week,btohqsg
when JPM interviewed me  the VP def came up with technical questions on the fly that was specifically meant to mindfuck me,btohqsg
More like welcome to coperate. The only human thing about Human Resources in an MNC is the word human,btohqsg
no just welcome to life in general,btohqsg
Literally everything I've been taught about company etiquette is being reversed,btohqsg
And it has really given me such a major insight into honestly how much a company can bs their way through society,btohqsg
nah i TA him next sem,btohqsg
i mean big question is did you pass complex,btohqsg
What's this conflict of interest tsk I wanna report dis,btohqsg
Despite not answering a single question in the finals,btohqsg
not like anything i teach is subjective to mark,btohqsg
Change Lestins answers to the correct one,btohqsg
Then i wouldnt get the mark,btohqsg
I think the next company I joined will also be such a bs company  constantly loosing money and nobody does anything about it 🤣,btohqsg
Reminds me of the time my prof set the quiz wrongly so ppl had to guess the correct answer  then when she corrected it those ppl got marked down,btohqsg
Every quiz question id be guessing anyway,btohqsg
My EEE friend did 1 question out of 5 in the exam she got an A+ for results,btohqsg
For some reason my physics cohort feels smart af,btohqsg
Either that or the profs have toned down their finals,btohqsg
My cohort feels like the extreme only... either very smart or fucking retarded,btohqsg
I belong to the latter half,btohqsg
I too belong to the latter half,btohqsg
But considering ive only been studying after week 13 maybe i can do better,btohqsg
At least we finally belong :D,btohqsg
I vomit blood from Week 3-14 and then go on holiday mood after,btohqsg
that should be the normal student way,btohqsg
but from week 3-14 i keep telling myself it can all be done during finals study week (no it cannot),btohqsg
I have actual assignments due by or on recess week,btohqsg
The Profs gives me comments on a final essay I am like... the sem is over and the grade is what it is. What am I supposed to do with those comments,btohqsg
it cannot. esp not QM 2,btohqsg
i will harass you to do well,btohqsg
"""How have you/would you handle <insert situation>?""",btohqsg
It is part of the interviewSome do aptitude tests separate  some merge it w the intv,btohqsg

"They keep saying ""This company ___ like to corporate tease all it workers""",btohqsg

But i bet the moderation is not in my favour so idk how,btohqsg
You are part and will always be part of the system,btohqsg
Coz one of the CA avg was 72%,btohqsg
Neh the final cGPA is out liao,btohqsg
Do u need a minimum degree honors classification to qualify for pharm licence?,btohqsg
Or not that i know of,btohqsg
Then it doesn't rlly matter what for Honors classification,btohqsg
she go back southeast asia and pharm (farm),btohqsg
🔥 my coworker keep telling me he wants to quit and go back china to farm,btohqsg
The moderation is for overall or component by component,btohqsg
