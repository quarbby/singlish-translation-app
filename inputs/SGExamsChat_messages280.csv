And why udw take physics tho,btohqsg
U can call seab to give u allowance,btohqsg
They said that science student for private candidate you need to take it before in school,btohqsg
If it weren‚Äôt for SS I would drop to combined,btohqsg
Ya u were a sch student so can take but no guarantees tho,btohqsg
I think he saying Ur sciences,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm not a sch candidate for physics,btohqsg
U cannnn take private Phys if U have taken practical sciences papers in sec,btohqsg
You can check the private candidate booklet,btohqsg
Eng chi pure sciences and humanities,btohqsg
Im infamous here for private candidate lol,btohqsg
I took 4 Os as n level kid lol,btohqsg
I have been thinking about being a priv candidate like for months,btohqsg
My sec Cher paid for me lel,btohqsg
FOr sg one subject is $90+,btohqsg
U think wat I do for free no string attached,btohqsg
Wait how you take for science,btohqsg
Wait why are you a priv candidate when you can go sec 5,btohqsg
@jacquelyn1234are u willing to take the risk to take phy and AM on ur own if u priv candidate?,btohqsg
Sec 5 need keep same subj,btohqsg
Cuz my sch wanted me to go pfp and not get bullied in sec ez,btohqsg
Then u try asking ur parents abt taking gap year,btohqsg
And u nid ALOT self discipline,btohqsg
Ye  u have alot of resoirces from sgexams as well (notes & exam papers) in the holy grail. Do depend on it as well,btohqsg
I see everyone holding their notes and coming back early,btohqsg
Why do I see this raffles girl reading her notes,btohqsg
Then wai u telling everything she do,btohqsg
And I thought it was a level,btohqsg
If I see u doesn't mean I nid tell 2470 ppl here,btohqsg
WoahYou also took private candidate before? Woah üòÖ,btohqsg
@jacquelyn1234do update if ur parents allow u take gap year,btohqsg
Anyone know any good places to find internships??,btohqsg
I got q alot of intern companies kek,btohqsg
Uhh anything in the finance or internet sector,btohqsg
Data analytics banking etc but no serious qualifications,btohqsg
Since I‚Äôm only y1 in poly,btohqsg
Unless ur gpa 3.8 and abv + portfolio is gd then can,btohqsg
Hi there ü§†! This month  SGExams is once again partnering with the Apex Club of Bukit Timah for a volunteering opportunity. We‚Äôll be packing üì¶ and distributing üßÉ food to elderly residents in the area!üìÖ Date: 4 September (Saturday)‚è∞ Reporting Time: 1.30pm or 2.00pm (Actual timing will be given closer to the date due to staggered reporting timing)üïí End Time: 3.00pmüìç Meeting Point: Block 89 Redhill Close  S150089üîó Sign-up Link:https://go.exams.sg/2l1tPlease double-check to ensure that you are free before signing up.

See you there üòé!Rules and guidelines,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt want to just do regular part time again,btohqsg
search online for small coy internships.They less particular abt qualifications,btohqsg
I can offer 3 areas  blockchain  marketing  youth organisation,btohqsg
but its not definite you'll get accepted,btohqsg
how does early admission work for alvls?,btohqsg
Ur prelims do well they send u letter for conditional admission registration,btohqsg
Or is that without a sport or committment,btohqsg
have yall bought from shein before,btohqsg
Nope I heard they sell cheap things that can be found from like taobao,btohqsg
But really some thing I seen from shein really can be found from taobao literally shein got dresses that looks exactly the same from them,btohqsg
No coz u need to be given a letter to even be able to do the conditional admission which is only given for those with good prelim results,btohqsg
I see  ar ethere any committments though,btohqsg
how are the results required to even get in,btohqsg
If its the same as COP,btohqsg
Idk I nvr did it ahaha,btohqsg
Uncle think Tracey Ferreira is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
Nice  imma do my best then,btohqsg
Takes away a bit of the stress of the actual exam I guess (you can get an offer based solely on prelim results),btohqsg
But yeah didn't really help much,btohqsg
Does lifelong learning institute have study spots for outsiders ?,btohqsg
Yes but now cuz of covid no,btohqsg
do u need the shipping guarantee,btohqsg
later the goods come spoilt like@imindomie,btohqsg
hello does anyone know which topics came out as full qns for pure geog 2020 Os,btohqsg
cause my tys is up to 2019,btohqsg
Are there assigned books for combined literature? I'm still clueless,btohqsg
Hi guys just wanted to ask  is it possible to go triple science if you want to take CLB? And can you even take CLB in express? And if no  if you get like F9 for MT and A1 for everything else  will it affect JC admission?,btohqsg
1) depends on sch policy but most likely yes in your sch2) yes3) you need D7 minimum for MT to go JC  but honestly quite hard to fail at o levels,btohqsg
Ah ok thanks  one more question  so if I get D7 will it affect JC admission? Or will they not care?,btohqsg
no they won‚Äôt care  anyway it‚Äôs MOE that puts you in the school,btohqsg
unless you get like L1R5 21 because your chinese D7 and you had to include it inside lah. in which case then ofc it matters,btohqsg
i‚Äôm a clb student myself so yes,btohqsg
Ah ok thank you very much!,btohqsg
What is that supposed to mean,btohqsg
I tot u insult me haha,btohqsg
But my school didn‚Äôt let me take CLB :(,btohqsg
"Hi! Those taking h2 fmath  how do y'all study for linear algebra? (span  LI  LC  generates  null  range  etc)And...do you actually need to state down every single definition during the proving or just state the ""workings""?",btohqsg
Linear algebra has a lot of terminology  so u would want to make sure u understand what they mean  and how they relate to one another  and how the abstract stuff like the terms u mentioned relate to the row operations stuff in particular,btohqsg
You don't need to define any of the terms used  because they're all very standard and well understood,btohqsg
Exam wise  they'll be asking to prove the relations only right? Or there would be more to it?(Ps. I'm taking as a private candidate  so don't have any background knowledge of how exam are tested for this subject),btohqsg
What u need to do in proving  eg proving that E is a subspace of X  is u need to write down the hypotheses (such as 'let x and y be in E' or 'let Œª be a real number')  then show the final statement,btohqsg
FM exams are very creative so honestly anything can happen  but if ur knowledge of how these concepts are related is solid  u should be able to tackle it,btohqsg
And of course if u haven't  watch 3B1B's video series on linear algebra,btohqsg
These videos are not really like a full guide to linear algebra  but more of how you should think about linear transformations and matrices and stuff,btohqsg
Okay  essentially  I need to understand and know the axioms required to be met for individual segment  and then to see how the different segments link up. Is that right?,btohqsg
About the axioms  you‚Äôll basically only see them when proving that something is a subspace  so just the 2 requirements of closed under addition and closed under scalar multiplication,btohqsg
But yeah u should understand each term  as in u should know what objects a term can be used on  and how the property described relates to other properties,btohqsg
Hmmm don't need the ones to prove whether it's a LC/ basis or whatever?,btohqsg
Those don‚Äôt involve the axioms of linear spaces,btohqsg
But u need to know what those terms mean in order to prove them of course,btohqsg
Ah okay. This chapter making me quite confused. I'll go read up my notes again,btohqsg
Yeah just organise ur thinking first,btohqsg
Then everything will match up nicely,btohqsg
LA is a well trodden path,btohqsg
Hi guysSorry for troubling y'all  but I need help with music theory againüò≠I feel my chords are a bit weird  so not sure if they are correct in the first place,btohqsg
The key is in G minor,btohqsg
2nd chord is probably wrong  you can't label it ib when there's no G at all,btohqsg
Well no offence. But i think chinese is impt. HAHAH,btohqsg
Failed until Sec 1 when they finally let me get exempted smh,btohqsg
Yeah but not as important as others  plus shld have some tech in teh future to help with language barriers. But knowing basic Chinese definitely imp,btohqsg
I think so. I knew someone who failed  then did clb  then failed clb  then finally exempted,btohqsg
Wtf i failed mlb like 4 years straight sia,btohqsg
China is the next super power,btohqsg
more or less  its good to know mandarin,btohqsg
The next super power are scammers on telegram man,btohqsg
They have been growing in number,btohqsg
I think even random people are making scam bots for fun,btohqsg
Could someone advice me on how to study for amath .I don‚Äôt know how to do any amath chapter I am not even exaggeratingI am taking olevel and I am not really stable to take my olevel,btohqsg
If anyone got advice for me please do,btohqsg
honestly not much u can do  other than more practice and looking through all the past practice u hv done and get a sense of how to attempt such questions and what mistake u hv made. anyways  u shld also seek help if u are unsure,btohqsg
the topical revision booklet helps show u the more common lower order qn types  and u shld look through ur school notes to see what tends to come out etc,btohqsg
Understand before moving on.Find any videos in youtube.,btohqsg

@ those poly kids do yall usually throw away ur stuff aft every semester?,btohqsg
Better yet if it‚Äôs 4.0 mugger notes,btohqsg
Better yet  photocopy your notes and sell multiple copies for multiple profits,btohqsg
what if its like just school printed materials,btohqsg
im still deciding whether to throw sia,btohqsg
Sell them to your sec Sch juniors,btohqsg
Or just send the soft copy,btohqsg
Be like eh you interested in so and so course right,btohqsg
You see my mods then see if you interested or not,btohqsg
If you got your own notes on it  that shows your annotations sell it for a price,btohqsg

hello how do you study for pure geog,btohqsg
this question is for anyone studying pure geog rn,btohqsg
random qns : is it illegal to drill at 12mn,btohqsg
my next door neighbour is having drilling rn,btohqsg
my dad left the house to confront them,btohqsg
cuz the gate lock spoilt nid to dismantle everything,btohqsg
if rlly urgent then bo pian,btohqsg
I couldn't hear anyth till I left my room to get water,btohqsg
Then my dad tell me neighbour be drilling,btohqsg
do they know how to fix it tho,btohqsg
Can someone help me with this? I'm seriously so stuck :(,btohqsg
And this too from the same question,btohqsg
Hmm go through the diff q types in each topic,btohqsg
I NEED THEM FOR NEXT SEMESTER,btohqsg
Like equation of circles‚Ä¶ questions on reflection of circle  finding centre of circle from tangent at one point and normal at another point (all normals pass through centre of circle) 2 points with same x-coordinate  hence forming vertical chord. Make use of ‚Äúperpendicular bisector of chord passes through centre of circle‚Äù to find midpoint coordinates  and find coordinates of Centre‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
For binomial theorem Finding term independent of x. Use formula for (r+1)th term‚Ä¶ equate x term to x^0 term  find r. Sub r into the expressionFor eg  find x^4 term. (1-x)^2(2 + 3x)^6 for eg‚Ä¶ expand the left one  and expand the right to get the terms that will pair with those on the left to find x^4 terms. Add up the coefficients for the answer‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Look through diff q types. How to solveA-math q are crafted in parts to help you solve subsequent parts. For example  in q on area under curve  they would ask you to find coordinates of points of intersections firstFor trigo R-formula questions  they would start with ‚Äúshow‚Äù question  then express using R-formula  then find max value‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Trigo proving q‚Ä¶ use diff techniques‚Ä¶ if can‚Äôt prove  go on to solve the trigo equation based on the result to show or prove,btohqsg
A-math q guides you. They provide instructions for you to guide you through. Such instructions will be lacking in jc math,btohqsg
Questions like show that the function is increasing or decreasing‚Ä¶ look out for squared terms‚Ä¶ because squared term is always positive,btohqsg
ok cos all the printed stuff are those i printed frm the soft copies on mel  none of it is extra materials,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt really give an answer to that,btohqsg
But I recommend change the color,btohqsg
after everyone in the block wakes up there will confirm be at least a few who know,btohqsg
Next time just burn the paper away. Liddat dunnid do alrd üòÇ,btohqsg
Who asking for resume? I can provide some examples,btohqsg
Ive decided to not disturb u today,btohqsg
@iWannaHideinaHoletoday is your last day of exam  am I right?,btohqsg
I wish you all the best,btohqsg
After your exam  you can finally,btohqsg
Also does anyone know if nafa/ laselle is counted as a uni//post sec pathway,btohqsg
Hey guys is there BELLCURVE for Nlvls for 2021?,btohqsg
I think my year dont have also just study hard can liao,btohqsg
Means the grading system is standard ?,btohqsg
yea there's a straitstimes article on it 1 or 2 years back,btohqsg
but that's just bellcurve  there's still grade boundaries  that's why you have ppl scoring 80+ for e math and still getting only A2,btohqsg
they adjust the min scores required for each grade,btohqsg
So i think example.... grade 2 will be within a range of,btohqsg
70-79 for example instead of 70-74,btohqsg
So ur grade 1 is 80 onwards i think.,btohqsg
Tbh i think combined sci for N(A) lvls to get grade 1 u need score 85 or btr lah,btohqsg
If want grade 1 for math,btohqsg
It means that there‚Äôs no rule saying ‚Äòonly 25% of people can get B‚Äô or ‚Äòonly 10% can get A‚Äô,btohqsg
U just need to do ur best,btohqsg
I hope there is no bell curve,btohqsg
Then why emath the A1 is 95 above,btohqsg
It's not a bellcurve but there's grade boundaries,btohqsg
And a pass is more than 50,btohqsg
Bellcurve is just a specific form of moderation,btohqsg
Ur assuming that this is true,btohqsg
As long u do well then yea ur fine,btohqsg
But there‚Äôs very little evidence to suggest that A1 is 95 and above,btohqsg
Other than ‚Äòoh I counted my marks and I got 95 but A2‚Äô,btohqsg
Which is as unreliable as it comes,btohqsg
By right you calcuated your marks is inaccruate.,btohqsg
U also won‚Äôt know ur marks isn‚Äôt it,btohqsg
And anyway A and Emaths have some of the highest distinction rates nationally,btohqsg
To be fair math is quite easy to count because other ppl do the paper and release the answers,btohqsg
What is grade boundaries  is it not just bell curve b a different name,btohqsg
But there‚Äôs working marks and everything which can throw off ur estimates quite a bit,btohqsg
They will adjust the marks accordingly to the difficulty of the paper,btohqsg
The main difference is that you are not compared against ur peers,btohqsg
As long as u make u do well,btohqsg
Bell curve says ‚Äòonly 25% of students can get A‚Äô,btohqsg
Tbh just study   u study hard enough for it then like,btohqsg
No need to fight with elite schools,btohqsg
Grade boundaries says ‚Äòeveryone above this mark can get A‚Äô,btohqsg
To be honest the grading system is pretty uncertain,btohqsg
Even if they did explicitly say no bell curve grading,btohqsg
So this will look at the examiner report  previous exam statistics.,btohqsg
But there‚Äôs nothing u can do about it anyway,btohqsg
To decide on the grade boundaries.,btohqsg
All u can do is to do ur best,btohqsg
And we have like 1/2 of a school getting A,btohqsg
Yeah which is why it‚Äôs quite unlikely bell curve exists,btohqsg
As in  exists in Sg school system,btohqsg
Or if exists   just not that we know what‚Äôs the percentages,btohqsg
Technically if more ppl do very well then the grade boundary will be adjusted up  so you are still fighting anyway,btohqsg
It's just not very practical to implement a strict bellcurve when there's (probably) little variation in scores and also potentially doubling people's L1R5 score over a 1 mark diff heh,btohqsg
If the paper is easy. The marks will get higher.,btohqsg
Fyi some question is set specically hard is to differentiate the A and the B,btohqsg
True sial   for combined science the specially harder qn are somewhat the intermediate level of pure science papers.,btohqsg
My cher said is use to differentiate a and b   might also be a1 from A2,btohqsg
got it from jurong tho cause  i thought you said jurong popular,btohqsg
but would prefer the grey one,btohqsg
walao i oni got grey one,btohqsg
HAHA i got it for my friends birthday so i let my friend take the one he prefers then i take the other one,btohqsg

Anyone has any good english tutor to recommend?,btohqsg
i think depends on teacher too  but my teacher was good,btohqsg
for instance they hv compre workshop and the notes r helpful,btohqsg
like they brk down the step to step as how to tackle compre,btohqsg
My friends used to attend british council but idk how good,btohqsg
My tution is 1k/month for eng;-; and  my results from U grade in  n level prelims to A1 for Os eng,btohqsg
If u ok w the price then I share :x cuz it rly gd,btohqsg
For me n my siblings at least,btohqsg
Could someone help meFor my olevel English compo section c. There is descriptive   narrative   argument and discursive writing rightMy school trains all of us to write argument and discursive writing which is never my strong suit . I tried writing an descriptive essay once and my eng cher just failed me without reading it   she advised on me to not write descriptive during olevel . Which I am not sure why ?Number two is I thought narrative and descriptive easier to write   can use the flowery language and I feel that Cambridge markers rather read up those than some boring argument essay .Idk what to do sial,btohqsg
Ok first thing first  ur teacher sucks,btohqsg
Its recommended to do discursive & argumentative cuz the strcuture is generally the same i.e. PEEL,btohqsg
Narrative & descriptive essays may be better since u dun need to come up with points like discursive  and can storytell wtv situation which can be easier,btohqsg
Cambridge markers mark hundreds of papers nonetheless  u may select wtv qns given in ur exam,btohqsg
This late in the year alr  would recc to stick to ur strengths and choose the qn that seems most comfortable to u,btohqsg
Choose narrative/descriptive since ur btr at those  just completely disregard what ur teacher says,btohqsg
Uncle think Niklas is spammer  so uncle kick!,btohqsg
Haha   I loved howYou straight up dissed my teacher,btohqsg
Sure . I guess I shall write that since narrative is really my strong suit,btohqsg
Wtf go away it‚Äôs up to you what u wan write,btohqsg
I tried out almost all types before,btohqsg
Still can‚Äôt find what I‚Äôm strong at,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just basically based on more of what ur preference are,btohqsg
simi is this dun read then fail ether,btohqsg
Unreliable hence not useful in grading essays smh,btohqsg
tru better to give constructive feedback then just outright deject,btohqsg
for secondary school and jc  i‚Äôd say the academic workshop works pretty well,btohqsg
She even criticized me   called me a clown . Seriously i swear I am not joking .‚Äò .... unless you what to fail your prelim   clown your way there .‚Äô,btohqsg
I swear I lost all of my respect for my eng cher,btohqsg
but ultimately looking back  argumentative is easier overall,btohqsg
This cher loves to criticize There are times when I feel so demoralized about failing my prelim,btohqsg
but ya just ignore ur cher,btohqsg
if u think u like descriptive/narrative just write it in o levels,btohqsg
it helps also if you going JC,btohqsg
JC there is no more descriptive/narrative,btohqsg
I look up tothis eng cher like she is a bully sial,btohqsg
I lost all of my respect to her already,btohqsg
a teacher is not a teacher if s/he puts down his/her students like that,btohqsg
so i dont blame you she doesnt deserve any respect in the first place,btohqsg
But I scanned though the olevel argument topic . Their some very difficult to write,btohqsg
rmb my JC had such a teacher,btohqsg
in the end the whole class did crazy well,btohqsg
but she did it in a good and bad way,btohqsg
"scolded the whole class ""hopeless  cannot go anywhere at this rate for xx subject""",btohqsg
Was she like stern but not really mean it,btohqsg
This cher when she voice her opinion on our class   is straight up criticism,btohqsg
Idk personally I think people do better for stories than those argumentative,btohqsg
I should ignore her   but sometimes her words just ...,btohqsg
i think kind of depends some ppl do better for stories some do better for argumentative,btohqsg
Yea especially for me becus u dont need much prior knowledge. U just bs ur way thru,btohqsg
i'm useless that's why i'm in sch  tchers are supposed to help instead of criticizing,btohqsg
omg i rmb this tuition tcher when i was pri 1,btohqsg
Anyway idk if starting to write discursive and argumentative in sec sch helps in jc,btohqsg
she called me a stupid buffalo LMAO,btohqsg
True   and argument requires facts which I don‚Äôt read the news often,btohqsg
In my class we all fail together,btohqsg
i find i do better for argumentative cause i dont have much flowery language and its easier for me to bs some example i rmb from some random place and smoke it,btohqsg
than try to write a good story,btohqsg
I dont think u need a lot of flowery language,btohqsg
I  wanna write a narrative essay and get b3 for eng and show it to her face,btohqsg
coffee makes my head hurt LOL,btohqsg
I think if u shd try to make ur essay non conventional,btohqsg
Like u can score q well even without fancy language,btohqsg
Or get a b3 and show it to her,btohqsg
True   most essay of there food grammar can score high,btohqsg

@raznflameI seriously think Kanye could have released it as 2 separate albums,btohqsg
The initial release date was sometime last year but he siked us,btohqsg
Nah  the whole theme is in sync,btohqsg
Whole album is 108 minsCDs can only fit 80 minsDouble disc makes sense,btohqsg
It is  I am not denying that but it sure feels that Kanye is stream trolling us with that amount of tracks with some of them being practical interludes,btohqsg
The first half is more rap based and heavy,btohqsg
The second half is more Kim & love related,btohqsg
It can be a double album and they both sync well,btohqsg
Its like the outkast speakerboxx/the love below,btohqsg
That is as old as me,btohqsg
You do know that the album (The Love below) is technically incomplete  right?,btohqsg
