Good question. I think maybe few months. I can‚Äôt find the TnC online anymore  it might have stated in there.,btohqsg

They sent you the thank you for signing up email. Haha. There is lunar cny promo now also. I saw the stated date there  can still find it online,btohqsg
It‚Äôs fine for me  I not in need for cash at the moment. But I worries it doesnt count in for the UOB interest only.,btohqsg

my xmas promo only starts to lock in as of yesterday.,btohqsg
but the bonus also accrues in yesterday,btohqsg
I‚Äôm taking abt the UOB interest bonus that‚Äôs up to 7.8% one not the xmas promo bonus. Haha.,btohqsg
Does the earmarked money earns the interest?,btohqsg
ya this one  u less 30K  most probably u signed up for the lockex in extra promo,btohqsg
which will give u extra $$$,btohqsg
under TOTAL amount  is the total amount you have transfeered.,btohqsg
I see. Glad to hear I would still get the up to 7.8% bonus. As I am new to UOB account.,btohqsg
Just received the Amex tcb. Can I check if the welcome offer 80 ecapita voucher for 250 spend within 1st month includes grab top-up? I'm considered new amex customer even if I have uob absolute correct?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best card to stack to buy engagement ring ?,btohqsg
Got so much 7.8% meh. Isit salary crediting or giro payment. Or both must have to obtain the highest interest,btohqsg
7.8% only for top tier $75000.01 to $100k  effective 5% for $100k,btohqsg
Up to 7.8%  if hit 100k max cap  EIR is 5% via the salary credit route üëçüèª,btohqsg
Yes. I understood this :) thanks for adding on :),btohqsg
is there a sign-up gift for amex tcb?üòÇ,btohqsg
Same as you  mine was earmarked yesterday. You probably signed up for the saving promotion in December 2022. So your funds will be credited back to you by 14 April 2023.Your earmarked amount will still qualify for the bonus interests of up to 7.8% as long as you spend $500 on the eligible UOB cards and credit your salary of at least 2k.I've verified everything mentioned above in this text at the UOB branch and call center.,btohqsg
4 miles per dollars for online transactions for Citi Rewards only apply for fashion merchants? I looked at the MCC  and only fashion stores are included,btohqsg
"it‚Äôs under ‚Äú10X points eligible transaction""",btohqsg
Haha see gxs logo in top,btohqsg
ahh I see 6ii) i missed it,btohqsg
6(i) is for offline  and 6(ii) is for online,btohqsg
I‚Äôm thinking of using UOB One as my main card  and then Citi Rewards for large purchases,btohqsg
I applied for Citi Rewards  since I already waited 2 weeks + for UOB One,btohqsg
but I might cancel after 2nd year  since the annual fees might be less than the gains,btohqsg
"‚ÄúFresh Funds‚Äù means a deposit of funds from outside of HSBC into the Eligible Account.Transfers from existing HSBC bank deposit accounts or via HSBC cheque(s)  cashier‚Äôs order (s)or demand draft(s) do not qualify. Funds that are transferred from existing or closed HSBCaccounts in the last 30 days are also excluded.I would like to ask about this HSBC Fresh funds  for the monthly fresh funds that has been deposited into the account  can I use it? or it has to be ""locked"" up?",btohqsg
can request to waive annual fee. so far no issue getting waiver,btohqsg
low spenders will probably be denied waiver,btohqsg
and is my first credit card,btohqsg
for first year for UOB one and Citi Rewards  do I have to call to request waiver? Or it‚Äôs automatic?,btohqsg
is Citi Miles the same as Krisflyer miles?,btohqsg
What is the best card to pay for physiotherapy (not done at govt hospital)?,btohqsg
Will paying grab rides with DBS Woman's Card earn 10x miles?,btohqsg
How do I know if my Company is crediting me through Giro or FAST?,btohqsg
Probably can ask HR on this?,btohqsg
What I did was to ask for cancellation.. immediately they say they would escalate for u to get it waived and someone would call u on this..  if they don't waive just cancel and get another card..,btohqsg
Seek the payment instructions through your HR department. They are probably in the best position to reply your query.,btohqsg
okay  so i first ask to waive  if no waive  then ask for cancel,btohqsg
