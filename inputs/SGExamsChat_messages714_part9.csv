I said this as a joke before but who knows maybe in 2030 NUS makes all admissions a common one u just apply and choose majors later,btohqsg
This is a freaking huge misconception amongst the general public in singapore,btohqsg
I think reasonable that it is direct entry,btohqsg
My friend went to comp eng coz  she didnt make it to comp sci due to A level screw up,btohqsg
But im p sure trf u apply through ur a lvl score,btohqsg
I thought good CAP in y1 for the related CS mods means transfer?,btohqsg
did bedok leave or sum ðŸ’€,btohqsg
No transfer either ways u need to qualify using the original Alevel score,btohqsg
If your Y1 CAP is high its a plus and helps your standing when u bid for mods,btohqsg
transferring isnâ€™t as clear cut as you think,btohqsg
communication between different faculties and schools is horrible LOL,btohqsg
The prof made me think it was ez,btohqsg
I used to think NTU was just one cohesive system and unit.. I don't think that anymore,btohqsg
NTU CS if I get in,btohqsg
Lmao even within CoHASS communication is terrible and there's no standardised system.,btohqsg
That one quite easy as it's under CoE,btohqsg
Actually atp not sure if Iâ€™ll even get into any comp courses so no point worrying,btohqsg
They might just put me in CHS for all I know XD,btohqsg
If u never declare major in your application for CHS it would be disadvantageous,btohqsg
So he canâ€™t dox more stuff about you here,btohqsg
Yeah I didnâ€™t whyâ€™s that tho,btohqsg
comp eng is under both college of engineering and sch of computing btw,btohqsg
got new college of computing and data sci,btohqsg
banking on a transfer in general is v iffy,btohqsg
gives me nyjc arts to sci stream vibes LOL,btohqsg
I mean comp eng isnâ€™t horrible,btohqsg
But too generic thatâ€™s the issue,btohqsg
Like EE is better with hardware and CS better with software,btohqsg
Youâ€™re in the middle of that,btohqsg
comp eng is more flexible but it means you're competing with both ends,btohqsg
That one we don't know the competition yet tho,btohqsg
yea but knowing the landscape of cs  i'm assuming it's v high,btohqsg
Then again I look at the structure they doubled the ICC Requirements for those,btohqsg
Wb SMUâ€™a cs is it any good,btohqsg
Yeah they have a crap ton of ICCs for those like 30+ almost 40 AUs worth of ICCs,btohqsg
i donâ€™t think youâ€™re shortchanged regardless of which CS course you go,btohqsg
Yeah thatâ€™s true  but I need the cert to work as a dev,btohqsg
just that the latter two have diff ways of teaching,btohqsg
Yeah^ tbh CS isn't so limited to just CS course.,btohqsg
i mean throughout the uni days youâ€™re expected to have some github of projects,btohqsg
To some extent yeah  but now like everybody is hopping onto dev jobs so youâ€™ll really need a computing cert to stand out  like pretty sure the top 75%ile EE grads are also doing dev roles or smth,btohqsg
i think their ICC here includes those non CC mods that are considered foundation core,btohqsg
