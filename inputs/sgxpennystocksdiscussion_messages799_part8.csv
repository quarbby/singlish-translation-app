Singapore Dollar Record High Versus Ringgit on China Worries:Source1. The Singaporean dollar surged to the strongest level on record against the Malaysian ringgit  with the latter suffering more from weakening confidence in China’s economic recovery.2. Singapore’s currency climbed 1.3% in the past four sessions against the ringgit  posting its best weekly advance in more than three months  as the island country’s dollar benefited from successive policy tightening and capital inflows. In contrast  ringgit has been impacted by a weaker China economic outlook weighing on exports growth as well as sluggish oil prices.3. “Historical ringgit volatility is picking up again  and I think that the main driver is the market’s incrementally more bearish views on China ” said Galvin Chia  a currency strategist at NatWest Markets.

I shared a lot on Sanli prior,btohqsg
Sanli have been consistently paying out dividends . Judging from past  average about 2.2% dividend yield.This time proposed dividends is $0.0078.Cannot be 7.8% dividends yield counter yea? So price need to move up tomorrow to bring it to a more reasonable yield,btohqsg

Not sure if I count correct. Let’s give Sanli a more reasonable dividend yield of say 5%.It’s price would need to be $0.15.Don’t forget this was an 2017 IPO counter $0.225 counter,btohqsg
