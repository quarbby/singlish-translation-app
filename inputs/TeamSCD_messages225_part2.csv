If not  u get loss of use,btohqsg
is not about whether have 50% or dont have,btohqsg
U know if u own your phv u still can get loss of income,btohqsg
is the fact that even after 50% lowered  the amount is still absurdly high,btohqsg
even if the engine blows on you  it can be deemed as your fault,btohqsg
Thats because ur insurance cant recoup with higher premiums after the accident,btohqsg
i talking abt CDW in rentalsss,btohqsg
And i was talking about excess in general,btohqsg
If u rent  drive like a mouse is what i would suggest,btohqsg
u can search up rental accident cases,btohqsg
they will give u amount but no break down,btohqsg
that total amount usually is equal to more damage than sustained,btohqsg
+ loss of income + possibly more damage than said,btohqsg
in the event u cant prove *,btohqsg
Own damage is the damage to your rental vehicle. 3rd party is the other vehicle(s) involved. It doesnt mean u pay,btohqsg
U are lowering ur excess payable,btohqsg
And u pay that excess if u have fault in an accident,btohqsg
they can still charge loss of income,btohqsg
I mean u need to understand half of that is from the third party,btohqsg
Look. U are seeing worst case scenarios where third party claims u more than 5.5k,btohqsg
The truth is u are best served by private settlement and self repair,btohqsg
If the rental company does the repair first thing on your bill is their loss of vehicle use,btohqsg
last i heard  engine problems…user had to pay although they had the CDW,btohqsg
If they say the repair and survey process is 2 weeks u just rented that car 2 weeks,btohqsg
U playing bumper car or what,btohqsg
u mean carsharing or rent frm garage?,btohqsg
most of the time they will let go dont worry,btohqsg
U not talking about door dings right,btohqsg
rock chips & smaller dents that cannot be controlled  haven’t heard a problem so far,btohqsg
got cases the engines just piang,btohqsg
How does it work if i refuse to pay,btohqsg
but rly not even the hirer fault,btohqsg
3 letter of reminder then court case?,btohqsg
The worst they can do is drag u to small claims,btohqsg
ya if u talking abt car sharing,btohqsg
but the minimum amt they need to inflate,btohqsg
Where they need to explain to the judge that ur 1 day rental is responsible for the 200k mileage engine problem,btohqsg
Do u see where im going with this,btohqsg
here is for car sharing engine issue,btohqsg
then the 5pm return turned into 4.30pmacc locked  deposit forfeit,btohqsg
app issue but didn’t bother to fightnot my choice  was the main drivers choice,btohqsg
rented two cars w the same person as my main driver,btohqsg
one of which was okay condition,btohqsg
the other one was torn & damaged lor,btohqsg
okay means got scratches & other stuff,btohqsg
we extend booking fr one hr,btohqsg
then because we were OTR we nvr see any changes,btohqsg
once car returned  suddenly we got the notif we return late,btohqsg
i own in a way  so i only used car sharing for fun,btohqsg
cos once u have ur own   is no point renting unless for fun,btohqsg
