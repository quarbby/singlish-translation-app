Is anyone having trouble with ochem alevels,btohqsg
I've had a severe headache after reading through first few line of a particular chapter,btohqsg
If you really feel like crying and you can't read ochem,btohqsg
only way to do ochem is to try to memorise the reagents and conditions  and practice till u can apply to context,btohqsg
if ur having a headache go rest first  no point cramming if ur not in the best state to cram,btohqsg
Honestly cramming is easier than knowing a hundred eqn but not knowing how to start,btohqsg
Thanks for the advices guys... Been tough lately,btohqsg
Itâ€™s normal to not understand just by reading,btohqsg
Listen to lectures  go for consults,btohqsg
No need wait liao I quit nus already,btohqsg
does anyone have a list on what to submit to your polytechnic ?,btohqsg
don't just memorise the mechanism  try to understand the mechanism and the concepts behind it if can,btohqsg
memorising can get you far but understanding is what gets u the A,btohqsg
Memorising the exam also gets the A,btohqsg
I mean  that's literally the goal of doing all questions in the TYS,btohqsg
If you really wanted to understand you'd do only 1 paper and screw the rest.,btohqsg
haha i came to realize the importance of understanding concepts when i went beyond sch test,btohqsg
honestly understanding is just as impt for chem,btohqsg
considering how they like to throw in application questions for ochem,btohqsg
anyone from nus? Can I check sth: if im offered merit scholarship  do I still have a chance of getting the global merit scholarship? (they didn't invite me for any interview etc.  so I'm confused how they made the decision),btohqsg
isnt nus scholarship application open till nxt week or smth,btohqsg
Sometimes yeah  I heard of people getting offered on the spot,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve never heard of people getting accepted without interview though  but I guess maybe thatâ€™s possible,btohqsg
he is a solid individual worthy of scholarship,btohqsg
I just saw this in the fine print,btohqsg
Please note that you may still be considered for the Global Merit Scholarship and may be contacted by the faculty for an interview between now and May 2020. If you do not hear from us by May 2020  this will be the finalized offer.,btohqsg
lol im applying for it now and the process rly sian,btohqsg
Got it mate imma crush this ochem once and for all,btohqsg
hope you can find patterns between the mechanisms to help u understand btr hehe,btohqsg
Might as well ask for the whole application,btohqsg
90rp will offer on the spot,btohqsg
But i never see before global merit scholars they r like unicorns lol,btohqsg
Unless u like represent sg or smth,btohqsg
And u founded a million dollar coy i think they will give u global merit,btohqsg
wah so hard to get one ah,btohqsg
90rp is not a good indicator of success in uni anyway,btohqsg
my batch got someone 87.5 rp global merit engineering scholar,btohqsg

hello can I ask for sit 72rp info security what are the chances of getting in,btohqsg
Are you within 2.5rp of the 10th percentile IGP?,btohqsg
"Also  will knowing the ""actual"" answer change your choice ranking?",btohqsg
Just put it on your choice list if you want to get in,btohqsg
Not like your choices will change even if it's a very low chance right,btohqsg
hmm but I heard that people with very low rank points of 50 plus and 60 plus can get in so maybe I have a chance?,btohqsg
i tried looking on online forums for the approx rp required but mostly is all gpa:/,btohqsg
