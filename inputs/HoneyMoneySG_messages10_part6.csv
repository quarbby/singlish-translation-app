If you think credit card company as a business. You remove promotion because promotion period ends or you losing too much money on promotion.,btohqsg

hmm thanks for the answer - i read the terms and not sure what category citi rewards have that hsbc dont havejust wondering why someone would pick citi rewards over hsbc revolution,btohqsg
yeah i saw the video and loved it - but was wondering why citi rewards seemed to be preferred over hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Because revo works on whitelist and citi rewards only has travel on blacklist,btohqsg
A few possible reasons:- Citi provides more airline partners for miles coversion- Citibank's mobile app is better- They may already have other Citi cards  so they just prefer Citi,btohqsg
But anyway  it doesn't hurt to get both  which I'm just going to do😁,btohqsg
oh yes  this is an important point  though I think revo's whitelist is extensive enough,btohqsg
thanks for replying chris - is there another video you made on what are the notable exclusions on revo? Saw the whitelist and looks quite extensive. I can watch the video instead to save you the trouble from explaining :),btohqsg
hmm yeah i think the airline partners is a good point too...,btohqsg
thank you so much - and also all that helped to answer 😊,btohqsg
Unless you join recently  i think i shout about it quite long already,btohqsg
