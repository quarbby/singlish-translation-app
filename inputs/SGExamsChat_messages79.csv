Arent aldehydes carbonyl grp with a hydrogen?,btohqsg
because it ends w a H,btohqsg
so anything before that doesn't matter,btohqsg
but your R2 is H leh,btohqsg
Skeletal structure usually don't put H,btohqsg
Skeletal formula  so if you see a C that doesn‚Äôt have 4 bonds  the remaining bonds are H,btohqsg
Ik the diagram is aldehyde  but he asking if C=O means aldehyde,btohqsg
just remember that aldehydes have the formula RCHO,btohqsg
It can be carbozilic acid  ketone or aldehyde  need see what the groip,btohqsg
Btw if you want to send questions of this level can try@SGExamsStudiesAs,btohqsg
I was tryingto find the grp but i couldnt,btohqsg
sorry all of u big brain,btohqsg
you asked if anyone was from biomed,btohqsg
you have a great memory haha,btohqsg
No one begins skool with knowledge of everything,btohqsg
In the picture he send  the R2 happen to be H  so it's aldehyde,btohqsg
But generally u need see what's the R group,btohqsg
Can be H can be hydrocarbon,btohqsg
HAHA i begin skool in a place i dont rly wna be in,btohqsg
but a lot of chem in your course whatt,btohqsg
so should be q fun  right?,btohqsg
ya but the specialistion stuff starts in y2,btohqsg
Except... maybe... the person say don‚Äôt expose... but we know who hahaha,btohqsg
ill have problems w those mainly regarding my course,btohqsg
This diagram will be more accurate if you're talking about ketones,btohqsg
i am from plant-san growing course,btohqsg
hello  from plant san growing course,btohqsg
Plants were never made to live forever,btohqsg
All plants do is just stand there,btohqsg
then where your O2 come from,btohqsg
Let's just face that all things will be perished in the future,btohqsg
itsok the person who earns is co owner,btohqsg
if there weren't plants we would all have died,btohqsg
you think humans would survive to discover the hydrolysis of water?,btohqsg
Yeah but r is used as an abbreviation of any group in which contains hydrogen or carbon,btohqsg
Many people say that science doesn‚Äôt have any room for argument,btohqsg
many people say i shld quit sci :>>,btohqsg
U need ur own sticker pack,btohqsg
but you can argue about what you can't see with the naked eye,btohqsg
john has his sticker pack tho,btohqsg
Ya! Lamarck‚Äôs theory is correct  no questions need to be asked.,btohqsg
I just realised we have sgexamsmemes,btohqsg
mine‚Äôs a crashed down site 404 not found,btohqsg
I will contact the sticker pack manager to add it by next week,btohqsg
yes yes v official & impt,btohqsg
Ahh sry guys but is it only in acyclic form glucose has aldehyde functional grp or both acyclic n cyclic?,btohqsg
Much like the plant san admin,btohqsg
I‚Äôm only good at saying things not doing things,btohqsg
Look at the structure change when it cyclise,btohqsg
Ask in the A level group,btohqsg
Thanks for the new sticker idea,btohqsg
HAHA oh and right i learnt smth tdy,btohqsg
rmb my 30% passing rate for my courses‚Äô chem module,btohqsg
You‚Äôre gonna be the top 1%,btohqsg
the things i do for pharm,btohqsg
Are you my reflection or am I your reflection? Have you intruded my soul or did I infect yours?,btohqsg
can I see your chem mod's syllabus,btohqsg
oh yea sure i dont have the full one tho,btohqsg
mole concept and stoichometry is the o‚Äôs pure chem one also p basic so far,btohqsg
but for atomic structure is was more the basic orbitals,btohqsg
may the 4th be with u,btohqsg
Wow they‚Äôre really speeding through it,btohqsg
Do you actually like actual talking?,btohqsg
I like the sound of my voice,btohqsg
Time to record an asmr video,btohqsg
The whole physical chemistry is boring,btohqsg
Organic chem is the fun part,btohqsg
Organic is the only reason to do chemistry,btohqsg
Organic chem is where the fun begins,btohqsg
I see that this is a rather popular opinion,btohqsg
U must have love physics then,btohqsg
Cos organic is a bunch of memorisations,btohqsg
Organic is memory  but it‚Äôs very elegant stuff,btohqsg
It‚Äôs all based on electron transfer,btohqsg
Maybe some of the reagent need memroise  but if u understand the mechanism actually no need memroise anythubg,btohqsg
Yes I meant the reagents and conditions,btohqsg
O lebel where need memroise anything hahah,btohqsg
i didnt rmb much of memorising for math leh,btohqsg
Maths concepts are elegant  so they are easy to remember,btohqsg
they gave the formulas ? no ?,btohqsg
A level Alot of shit to rmb sia,btohqsg
O level no formula one la haha,btohqsg
This doesn‚Äôt seem to suggest you like talking though,btohqsg
Its okay. I used to be u qualified also,btohqsg
It has a 9 section data booklet of things,btohqsg
This group have unqualified admins also,btohqsg
cos i need to remind myself why i ended up whr i am üò©,btohqsg
But in the end they still admins,btohqsg
But I am a complex figure,btohqsg
I like talking to particular people in particular circumstances,btohqsg
I was a hardcore gamer addict sia,btohqsg
ya thus i did badly & said ok i‚Äôll go poly,btohqsg
I wish i had gone poly,btohqsg
and thus i‚Äôm in the loop of,btohqsg
yay ! why did i do this,btohqsg
Are you really willing to spend 3 years in pre U,btohqsg
Can I assume my joke landed,btohqsg
i was debating to go MI or poly,btohqsg
Oh shit i am indeed a boomer now,btohqsg
Now I see why Neil and john,btohqsg
Your poly is like right beside MI,btohqsg
If those r ur only two concersn about thats sch,btohqsg
And we‚Äôre back to being very similar again HAHAHA,btohqsg
U were never on the top 2,btohqsg
ya ok here‚Äôs the diff in poly & mi tho,btohqsg
if i go mi   i‚Äôm not confident in scoring for a‚Äôs,btohqsg
Isnt Mi at cck or smt,btohqsg
Of people rising from the lowest rank,btohqsg
Well if you look at it on a map,btohqsg
Worst in cohort ppl doing well,btohqsg
They look right beside each other,btohqsg
Idk how tru are the rumors,btohqsg
so if poly-> i maintain a steady gpa-> and mug-> its makes more sense cos idh to worry abt chinese or gp,btohqsg
Do uk any poly called nap ?,btohqsg
idk its whr i belong tho,btohqsg
and NP is arnd clementi and beauty world,btohqsg
U sound like you‚Äôd enjoy GP,btohqsg
ya thats wht the jc kid in my class said,btohqsg
Also  no one cares about Chinese in jc,btohqsg
Lmao gp made my choices lean towards poly more,btohqsg
she said its such a waste someone like me went poly,btohqsg
and that i‚Äôm gna suffer in poly,btohqsg
the only NAP ik is nucleosomeAssembly protein,btohqsg
How many Ngee Ann Poly Students does it take to change a lightbulb?It never gets changed  everybody be nappin‚Äô,btohqsg
LMAO i go poly to specialise in chinese,btohqsg
cos she has some h2 chem bg and she‚Äôs saying she‚Äôs struggling and thus im in a bad position,btohqsg
61-year-old man arrested for attempted murder of NParks officer who was installing SafeEntry signs along Sungei Serangoon Park Connector.https://cna.asia/2Yv1wQv,btohqsg
With singapore ngee ann polytechnic it's so possible to#ownyourxtra,btohqsg
Must be hard struggling for h2 chem,btohqsg
If youre using cl for your rp,btohqsg
Ur poly stuff is as hard as h2 chem also,btohqsg
cos i look at the sllyabus compared to h2 chem,btohqsg
Yes im np embassador dun @ me,btohqsg
Np best poly dun @ me,btohqsg
i only doing quantum numbers rn,btohqsg
U would have loved h3 pharm chem,btohqsg
I think JC got more opportunities,btohqsg
Depends on the kind of opportunities,btohqsg
Tell that to internship based jobs,btohqsg
Poly has an internship baked into the syllabus,btohqsg
I honestly think JC have Alot alot of opportunities  just need to grab,btohqsg
Which is 70% of the industries,btohqsg
JC internships are few and far between,btohqsg
Like u can go for conference  meet some professor  talk to them and ask to do a project with them,btohqsg
Even the worst people in poly go for mandoatort internships,btohqsg
Jc is a gateway into higher education,btohqsg
U have to even qualify for it not handed over like in poly,btohqsg
My sec sch is light on the hill alr so ez game la,btohqsg
Poly is a gateway into the working world,btohqsg
No leh  my school is open to all first come first serve,btohqsg
Jc is all about academics arh,btohqsg
i fat i roll off  the hill,btohqsg
Idl but used to it kek,btohqsg
Not prepare u for workforce also,btohqsg
In fact that's how I met my mentor  I was in the conference than he came up to me and ask if I want to do a project,btohqsg
Like if u go as an individual,btohqsg
U can still just walk up to a professor,btohqsg
Eh bruh fine i go look for ym bye,btohqsg
Skool introduces you to such conferences,btohqsg
Some prof not so friendly one,btohqsg
But would the professor still be willing to approach you if you weren‚Äôt from X JC,btohqsg
No one knows other than u and me,btohqsg
alot of lecturers in poly nice tho,btohqsg
Says the one who leaked et smh,btohqsg
Das for more sci based stuff,btohqsg
Some uni profs u email he also dont reply one,btohqsg
Uk how many prof i email,btohqsg
U use what mail to email,btohqsg
Not uni mail of course he wont reply,btohqsg
i got lecturer ask me what‚Äôs an infographic :‚Äù),btohqsg
Which prof will reply to gmail,btohqsg
Maybe i should use my web mail,btohqsg
They dont reply to external mails,btohqsg
I share with y'all a story  the true story of how I met my mentor,btohqsg
U are not his student he reply you for what,btohqsg
I had a skin allergy  I needed help,btohqsg
must be nice having a mentor,btohqsg
Than he happen to be a doctor  than I ask him if he can give me an appointment at hospital,btohqsg
Than he gave me an appointment within a week,btohqsg
Instead of waiting at polyclinic for months,btohqsg
I called punggol climic for minor surgery in feb,btohqsg
Than to thank him  I do project with him,btohqsg
Some even struggle to navigate lol,btohqsg
And the first time I met him,btohqsg
Or some give 1 word reply only,btohqsg
Thats a sign of disinterest according to tinder,btohqsg
No luck ? What the fu*k,btohqsg
i got scolded by a lecturer who said that suggesting using videos to educate chemical stuff in products was out of my place & course of study bcos ‚Äú science students can‚Äôt do media ! u from media meh ? ‚Äú :‚Äù),btohqsg
rip my grades for that module tho,btohqsg
Is it luck? Or is it networks?,btohqsg
Very lucky no network  how lucky also at most help you win 4D nia,btohqsg
Discrete math mod in the past the prof forced the students to make a video on number theory,btohqsg
Is legit luck  I never had network before in my life until I entered JC,btohqsg
Are there any boomer groups ?,btohqsg
she was like u prove to me u can make it work ? it‚Äôs not feasible! what‚Äôs more feasible is u going to sec schs to conduct workshops !,btohqsg
Is it luck that your JC gave you networks? Or is networks institutionally entrenched in your JC?,btohqsg
I mean I would say my jc have more opportunities than some other jc,btohqsg
Does discrete maths not cover number theory or,btohqsg
It covers but to make a video on number theory as project is ridiculous,btohqsg
It seems pretty interesting to me,btohqsg
Or draw a comic on carmichael numbers,btohqsg
U email this prof he will reply,btohqsg
U can just google all the commands for it no ?,btohqsg
As in all the meta links  tags  schema an xml siteMap,btohqsg
Yeah i have not seen anyone sctually do it manually HAHAH even i just google,btohqsg
Yeah most of ot u can just google and edit for ur needs,btohqsg
Except for xml and domain side,btohqsg
Ssl certs u gotta ask ur host provider,btohqsg
Whats the website if i can ask,btohqsg
Answer ques on study grp heheh,btohqsg
U arent in the grp tho hahah,btohqsg
Makes no difference to me hahaha if someone ask ques in bio grp there i would answer also. Education dun care about group feuds,btohqsg
Just aim high gradeAnd pull up my cgpa,btohqsg
U must be a fun person,btohqsg
projects effort to reward ratio cmi,btohqsg
I stuck at home for 4 months...,btohqsg
Especially my FM exams where u find out how heartless the tutor is,btohqsg
Summer sem also needs zoom lessons,btohqsg
Well about half the class dies,btohqsg
Someone trying to make sgexams 3.0 is it,btohqsg
Dun think he would‚Äôve stuck around,btohqsg
Work for work? I only know work for reward  reward for work,btohqsg
Idw to sit down but I'm sitting down,btohqsg
I have one in 2 hours,btohqsg
Just looking through my notes at this point,btohqsg
I have 4000 words of submission due 2359 7 May and here I am... ü§£,btohqsg
Out of all the mods I'm taking,btohqsg
I actually hate this mod the most,btohqsg
So I'm glad to be done with its finals,btohqsg
You study when sequences converge and stuff,btohqsg
I thought it‚Äôd be a <REDACTED> mod. Redacted to not dox.,btohqsg
NTU can afford for that to happen coz they are allowed to SU everything,btohqsg
No can su all if u got enough SU to use,btohqsg
But u can su all now,btohqsg
If u got enough SU credit,btohqsg
Yea lah but NTU by default this Sem everything can SU  so if you‚Äôre wronged by cheaters in the bellcurve for all your mods  you can SU,btohqsg
Su too much not nice on transcript also,btohqsg
lol zoom finals damn lame  had to wait 30 mins extra cause some buggers never press the green tick icon to indicate that they're done reeeee,btohqsg
If you no have enough SU  you can‚Äôt SU everything  if it happens that all your mod got cheaters  no recourse.,btohqsg
but actually quite refreshing to not need to appear at the MPH,btohqsg
But if you got too many S later ur employer thought u get all C,btohqsg
No need to squeeze in and out,btohqsg
B+ will only serve to drag your gpa down,btohqsg
This one going for make or break,btohqsg
actually in the grand scheme of things you'll still have a sizable base in the end  cause SUs are very limited,btohqsg
You should use ur SU on crap modules like IS1103,btohqsg
i actually did well for is1103,btohqsg
If worry base too small  overload lor LAWL,btohqsg
Imagine all the 1010e ppl who cheated and now cannot su,btohqsg
Under time pressure they wont think too much lorh,btohqsg
If they get F then stuck with them forever lorh,btohqsg
For every ethical employer out there  there‚Äôs always an unethical employer serving the market left behind by ethical employers.,btohqsg
