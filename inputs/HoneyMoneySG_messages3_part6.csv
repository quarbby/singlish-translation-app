Hi  not sure if this is an appropriate  forum to ask  but would anyone have any recommendations on what is the best way to get USDC in the first place  in order to make the deposit of the USDC into Hodlnaut  to enjoy the welcome affiliate bonus?,btohqsg
Thanks punkGrab 25% off reward points again guys,btohqsg
So far what is the best deal for CapitaStar redemption,btohqsg
Haidilao  offer to pay first then collect from friends,btohqsg
Oh I meant for the grabrewards redemption. Like this time it is 25% off. I think previously it was 30% points rebate?,btohqsg
30%/35% is quite rare maybe 2 times a year only,btohqsg
20% is common. 25% is a good enough deal,btohqsg
Just earn and spend dont hoard too much  similar to miles,btohqsg
Yea i think so too. Cause there is a limit to redemption too. Like this time it is limited to 15X,btohqsg

Today I made another block chain,btohqsg
Hello  sorry can I ask if anyone might know what is the usual processing time for international wiring from DBS Remit into Gemini?,btohqsg
Whats that? Is it bank transfer?,btohqsg
Okay I see! Thanks for this  I actually did a transfer last night but it‚Äôs still not in the Gemini account yet  so am wondering if it‚Äôs an aberration or a norm,btohqsg
Oooo waaa  u transfered into the acc stated acc ? Some cimb bank berhad right,btohqsg
It was to Silvergate  in USD,btohqsg
i did mine at around 7pm  money came in at 11pm,btohqsg
SGD for me is 15 mins,btohqsg
Usd have cut off time ah,btohqsg
SGD more efficient but you can only get BTC and ETH with SGD,btohqsg
if you do swapping then you incur the platform fees,btohqsg
Send to other platforms to do the swapping  not too expensive   coin prices fluctuates. It depends if u want convenience / efficiency,btohqsg
over night prices of coin may move up or down quite abit alrdy,btohqsg
Okay I see!! Thanks so much for the info above  really appreciate it,btohqsg
Guess I‚Äôll just wait a bit more to see how long more before the USD reaches Gemini haha  and will need to weigh the pros and cons of the coin fluctuations against savings on exchange rate conversion fees / speed of conversion,btohqsg
i used@wilflarestrategy  for Gemini it will be by 10pmQUOTEbefore 2PM settle your SGD to USD exchange at Moomoosend USD from Moomoo to DBS MCAby 5PM DBS MCA should receive your USDsend out anytime in the evening to FTX via DBS Remit by 8PM USD is on FTX ready for deploymentUNQUOTE,btohqsg
hahaha trying to spread your awesome strategy to the rest,btohqsg
I think it's better to convert a bulk and send more over. there are so many options for staking stablecoins these days and they offer better rates than say Asia's best bank üòÇ,btohqsg
yea there's a frictional cost if you have to keep converting every time you wanna buyif you are the sort to DCA weekly  then why not consider monthly?it's better to have a % of stables so you can take advantage of dipsand with so many opportunities to earn higher % interest rates on stablecoins  your opportunity cost of holding the money in the üè¶ is lower (or depending on your perspective  is now higher),btohqsg
wow nice  thanks so much for this info,btohqsg
are there any other resources online that you‚Äôd recommend reading up on  to learn more about this?,btohqsg
hi guys  quick question on IBKR. do you guys usually buy the market price or bid lower and wait for a match?,btohqsg
been waiting for a while for my bid to be matched lol. getting a little twitchy haha..,btohqsg
I buy in small batches so usually submit limit order slightly below current price,btohqsg
market value order is fine too because small trade size means the difference is small anyway,btohqsg
yeah imma cancel my bid offer by tomorrow,btohqsg
then fresh buy based on market price haha,btohqsg
Yes did a video on this  with Wil's wisdom,btohqsg
