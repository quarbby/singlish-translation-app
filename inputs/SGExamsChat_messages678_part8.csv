most jcs dont offer h2 bio w/o chem,btohqsg
H2 physics do be fun though,btohqsg
C5 throughout sec 3-4  magically pulled a A2 in Os and doing well in JC,btohqsg
But yeah i gets why people dont wanna do it,btohqsg
My physics journey in sec sch pushed me to h1 (which is somehow easier than os),btohqsg
It is coz it is compulsory,btohqsg
Like if u take H2 bio  h2 chem is comoulsory,btohqsg
I thought there was the rare phy bio combi you could do,btohqsg
No wonder you topped our school....,btohqsg
Oh really? I read that h2 chem is compulsory w h2 bio,btohqsg
The last time i got 90% for a subject is in sec 3 math ca1,btohqsg
I actually didnt know there is h1 math in sci combi,btohqsg
lol ik quite a few BCmE ppl,btohqsg
My A1 not even that high sia,btohqsg
Idk why would they do that:-(,btohqsg
Why u dw take pure sci,btohqsg
its not moe requirement but most schools wont allow h2 bio without h2 chem because h2 bio alone isnt really needed for any uni courses and alot of the concepts in h2 bio are related to h2 chem,btohqsg
Then combine sci to h2 sci is a super big jump,btohqsg
I rmb they had to take bridging lessons or smyh,btohqsg
Wtf why TM now got all these weird fuck combis,btohqsg
Btw dun mind me asking how does the n lvl grading like to qualify to jc,btohqsg
