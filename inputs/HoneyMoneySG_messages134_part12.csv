Hi  I just want to put a note for those using YouTrip in Malaysia‚Ä¶ the rate fluctuate a lot compared to to XE exchange rate or google rate and it is not weekend.,btohqsg
yes  like i mentioned in the video,btohqsg
hi all  i see a bank offering me 2.8% and up to 120k  why is this so when there's over 3% interest with FD. Does it mean i can loan and redeposit?,btohqsg
hey guys  do i still get bonus miles (for UOB lady‚Äôs) if i pay via apple pay?,btohqsg
Yeah ringgit appears to be a known problem withAmazeYouTripIn the sense the actual fx spread charged over spot rate can fluctuate greatly. Not the usual 0.3% for YouTrip. Not the usual 2.5% for amaze.I myself haven‚Äôt analysed a lot as I hardly go Malaysia but if I go Malaysia I always use Maybank family and friends for 8% cash rebate. Sure enough to cover the fx spread.,btohqsg
ive purchased travel insurance that states to cover flight delays/cancellations,btohqsg
yes understood  however the airline did not compensate for the cancellation.as such was wondering if anyone here sucessfully made a claim via their travel insurance for a cancelled flight/flight delayed above 4 hours,btohqsg
If it is loan 2.8%  actual rate EIR is 5-6%.,btohqsg
yes for MCCs under your selected category,btohqsg
Bank can offer you zero interest rate. It is real but the processing fee may cost you 5%. Some banks may defer the release of payment to you  that will cost you another $$$. Real EIR is different from advertised rate. Ie. 2.8%,btohqsg
Yes  I had viewed your video and take that. To my surprise  it was transacted at 3.18..I can‚Äôt share the screenshot yet as I had just joined into this telegram,btohqsg
Thanks for the tip  look like no choice but to apply for this Maybank credit card ‚Ä¶ else it will be Trust or GXS Debit,btohqsg
Will CPF OA use for CFPIS-OA investment will charge accrued interest?,btohqsg
For UOB PPV it calculate based on statement month or calendar month?i just read t&c few times   can‚Äôt find,btohqsg
"You can ""preview"" the exchange rates before you use your Visa/Mastercardhttps://www.mastercard.us/en-us/personal/get-support/convert-currency.htmlhttps://www.visa.com.sg/support/consumer/travel-support/exchange-rate-calculator.htmlYou can then make an informed decision whether to use Visa/Mastercard or just use cash",btohqsg
c) The UNI$10 awarded to you from qualifying spend on Selected Online Transactions and Mobile Contactless Transactions is comprised of a basic UNI$1 earned plus a bonus UNI$9. The total bonus UNI$ awarded to you from qualifying spend on Selected Online Transactions and Mobile Contactless Transactions is capped at UNI$2 000 for each calendar month.,btohqsg
Thanks for the pointer. I had made the assumption(at that time) that it is always more beneficial when using YouTrip in Malaysia. Didn‚Äôt bother to check again when I was there.,btohqsg
Halo  its my first time redeem SQ miles  i have enough miles to redeem 2 tickets  but i have child  can buy remaining ticket for child only? Via online need at least 1 adult. Anyone experience with this?,btohqsg

Good for those who didn‚Äôt select right categories for Maybank FnF,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt say cannot.Some people changed recently and now need to wait the next quarter. Some people don‚Äôt have Maybank FnF.,btohqsg
May i know the Maybank family and friends credit card can add into Google pay wallet?,btohqsg
So when i using Amaze to simplygo is consider online fashion or transport category?,btohqsg
Of course Transport üòÇUsing it with Amaze turns it into online transaction  but not everything under Fashion. Maybank provided which MCCs for Online Fashion.,btohqsg
