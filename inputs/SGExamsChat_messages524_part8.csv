The thing is tho.. how does MI even track that?,btohqsg
RI and HCI both are unable to track that also liao cuz if you think about it how would the JC know.,btohqsg
The only thing they would know is your RP and the subjects you passed etc,btohqsg
if fail h2 how to be eligible,btohqsg
Exactly the general entry requirements is legit just 3 H2 passes,btohqsg
But u try applying to AUs with a EEE u see how,btohqsg
how confident are u in the other qn,btohqsg
so 50% fail at least 1 h2 or gp,btohqsg
Which is concerning cuz 93% passes 3H2s at least,btohqsg
Of like the entire SG alevel cohort,btohqsg
the whole cohort that takes a levels in a year is less than 200 students,btohqsg
so the ppl failing is like 70-100,btohqsg
Ya la but u get my point in that MI also houses the large majority of those who are in the 7% that failed,btohqsg
this was one of my other mods last sem,btohqsg
if one complement not good just grind for the others,btohqsg
Exactly and my point is the stats even MI releases themselves don't look good lol,btohqsg
I think yi + JP got more,btohqsg
their average rp not exactly that high,btohqsg
makes sense for yi to have more,btohqsg
apparently for the batch of year 1s this year 60% is eligible for jc,btohqsg
Tbvh I don't rlly see the appeal of that..Like if you are gonna spend 3 years just go take Diploma.. u can use that in the workplace still,btohqsg
Like most ppl take Alevels mainly cuz its faster than poly,btohqsg
assuming u stay the same field,btohqsg
dun complain and just serve knn,btohqsg
ok la i also dowan serve hahahaha,btohqsg
feel like i serving india with all the ceca cmg inðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
ya  ns got times u can just enjoy with ur friend also,btohqsg
Na bro even if such a thing was accepted MINDEF will just do it the mindef way... like what they did to JWs back when that was still legal,btohqsg
Whole lot go DB for 3 years can liao,btohqsg
He choose the wrong platform to rant lol this is a policy issue u wan u go fuck up the ministers,btohqsg
Disclaimer: not necessarily every diploma directly related to the uni major have exemptions.,btohqsg
i wish i could do that in ch,btohqsg
3 years YI means still taking A level at the end with subsidised fees,btohqsg
If you feel you might buang As even after 3 years and sort of have an idea what industry you want to enter  then go poly,btohqsg
Isn't that common knowledge tbh the only one who does exemptions is Engineering,btohqsg
Not really eh some people do think the exception is guaranteed if your diploma is related,btohqsg
NTU CS does exemptions as well but only for UEs I believe,btohqsg
Im reliving my sec school life in poly,btohqsg
still got a B grade for the lesson tho,btohqsg
i heard now for rp sci,btohqsg
the grade thing is for like a few weeks or smth,btohqsg
u still cant get over my 2 5cu paper,btohqsg
make sure u got a back up plan,btohqsg
Yes it will.. H2 maths is build on Amaths,btohqsg
Dk if it's possible but you can try to take Amaths at Os as its really helpful if u wanna take maths in JC,btohqsg
Well look at the syllabus for h2 maths but basically these topics are assume for you to have so u must get a decent understanding of them,btohqsg
I have to ask tho.. what course are u aiming for because the requirement might be of a lesser rigour.. like H1 Maths,btohqsg
H1 Maths is usually only required,btohqsg
Not really it's just the most common arts stream subject.. you can take History Lit Geo if u want,btohqsg
But if u drop maths to a H1 which i highly recommend then you would have to take a art subject at H2,btohqsg
