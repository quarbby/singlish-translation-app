sure-fire way to get timmac closed off to public with the amount of meets ü§£,btohqsg
cs3s doing one tire fires  pops and bangs that aren't enforced,btohqsg
and how would you enforce said rules?,btohqsg
every night meet ends up with either someone's pop and bang tuned car blowing up or someone with an open diff trying to do a burnout  ending hilariously.,btohqsg
so what's being done to enforce it?,btohqsg
not the first CS3 to do a one wheel peel üòá,btohqsg
you lot that host meets need to seriously enforce the idiots that do this type of shit,btohqsg
at the least  respect the place you're holding your meets at.,btohqsg
if u take offence to it  he has video evidence & it‚Äôs generally always the same model of car that stirs up this kinda trouble ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
wonder if this guy got a police report lol,btohqsg
there are rules yes  but if people keep disrespecting the location and disregarding the rules then no point,btohqsg
hope it doesn't but seeing how the meets are nowadays it's only a matter of timeüò¨,btohqsg
the unholy trinity would be the CS3s  1.4 Roccos and Lancer EXs LMAOOO,btohqsg

after sending this nothing was done in subsequent meets hosted by said organiser,btohqsg

doesn't seem responsible to me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
feedback from someone who went the morning AFTER the 30 march meet,btohqsg
i seriously doubt this organiser has any responsibility when he hosts his meets unlike some others who have done the role of cleaning up after others when their own meets were overthat being said  not surprised if the name gets a bad rep in the future. and with the authorities no less üòÜ(which i am pretty sure are in here),btohqsg
i don‚Äôt want to just say one particular person  but everytime there‚Äôs a story or trouble comes it‚Äôs always from the same groups who hold their car meets,btohqsg
anyways ü§£ u know who u are la hor... if continue maybe name and shame is the way to go,btohqsg
"they're quite ""elusive"" when it comes to being responsible huh.",btohqsg

"my response to your texts in the future will be followed by ""i will talk the other""",btohqsg

actually im down the road from them,btohqsg
might as well drop by tp hq later right üòÜ,btohqsg
maybe TP should be a mainstay at all meets to enforce them in the future don't you think,btohqsg
