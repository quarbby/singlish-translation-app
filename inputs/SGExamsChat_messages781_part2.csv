I find it hard to believe the teacher can be good at all of them lol. Seems like a case of Jack of all trades master of none,btohqsg
But actually by beatings what are you referring to,btohqsg
It's an old adage that describes the zero sum game that is the economic system we have today.,btohqsg
the students did not quite good in the end üòî 21,btohqsg
Ohh ic  just realised what it means when I googled it. First time I heard that phrase,btohqsg
How much did the tutor charge lol,btohqsg
They just have gotten scammed rly bad,btohqsg
no idea they did not told me,btohqsg
If a tutor claims they can teach more than 2 subjects at the o levels it‚Äôs usually a red flag most of the time ngl. What are the chances of them having studied at a higher level all the subjects they said that they‚Äôre qualified to teach,btohqsg
Usually good tutors will specialise in 1-2 subjects and be really good at teaching them,btohqsg
But yea generally they will specialise in one or two subjects...,btohqsg
agree...it is too much to handle (some cant even teach one properly),btohqsg
But ngl this one very overkill,btohqsg
I also find it too good to be true,btohqsg
This one reminds me of the meme in the Internet where the lecturer has multiple PhD,btohqsg
Like the PhD filled up like one whole PPT slide,btohqsg
but isnt teaching just learning the nuances of the subject matter (like learning what certain keywords are important and imparting them to the students),btohqsg
In Uni it's just part of their tenure requirements,btohqsg
Imo the ones that are good is usually Assistant Profs or Lecturer that kind cuz they need to fight for their job.,btohqsg
That is legit crazy and hard to believe‚Ä¶even if yes it is possible to score well in all in sch‚Ä¶but uk comparative advantage and if each specializes in their comparative advantage  everyone will be better off  one cannot possibly do everything (and teaches well in all),btohqsg
Plus if you actually are good in everything...,btohqsg
You probably should be doing something way better as a career choice,btohqsg
Tbh if u are straight As i dun think u will go to teaching and then teach everything,btohqsg
Anyone here live near/in chai chee?,btohqsg
There will be people who actually have the passion in teaching,btohqsg
Yea but even if so  they wun teach everything  like i dun see someone who likes every single subject as well,btohqsg
Its just that if you are good in everything  especially as a working adult,btohqsg
Doing freelance teaching is probably something you will not be doing,btohqsg
Because the dudes subject that he can teach is... A lot of difference,btohqsg
Some more it is like not even PSLE,btohqsg
Either way the thing is we know that this dude is not legit,btohqsg
yea like teachers usually specialise in 1 or at most 2 very related subjects (like phys and math  ell and gp  bio and chem etc),btohqsg
dw happens to the best of us..i spent half the day on my bed cause it was burning hot,btohqsg
I heard they removing mye for j2s,btohqsg
Sec sch ok I close 2 eyes,btohqsg
apparently the current principal at asr pioneered it,btohqsg
Then later uni how 10 hours paper,btohqsg

nah wont be that long lah,btohqsg
"""Take a trip down memory lane""",btohqsg
This is why Jc students got upper hand for exam stamina,btohqsg
what subject should i do now,btohqsg
even better  covid burnt in fire,btohqsg
Eh when is the next football boys match,btohqsg
