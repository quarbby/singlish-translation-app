For this there is alot of assumptionBased on the photo:They assume you‚Äôre drawing a salary of3000$Price of the 3room is240 000$You have CPF (OA) savings of at least36 000$Your EHG will be65 000$based on the 3000$ salaryYour monthly repayment will be estimated to be$631So if you want to pay more by cash you can do soEg 231$ cash 400$ cpf is ‚úÖ,btohqsg
But if you can use your entirety of your CPF to offset will be great. Have some spare liquidity cash on hand. Put in some long term investment plan may get you higher than the 2.6% interest. And also the monthly repayment will differ from the table if the house price is more than 240 000$. Or if your CPF saving is less than 36 000$,btohqsg
If I draw1900-2500depending cause I'm a gym sales staff some months like January there is more sales I can hit up to $3000. Rest of the months just getting by with1900-2300,btohqsg
My cpf I think 17000 only,btohqsg
But every month contributtions is about 600 at least,btohqsg

You might want to check how much can u get for the housing loan first by applying for it. They will let u know with ur current income  how much will they loan u n the monthly payment u will need to pay either using CPF or by cash.,btohqsg
From the image  the housing loan of 139k is based on the 3k household income. You might get lesser loan amt based on ur income. Which also mean u might need to pay off more than 36k for the remaining depending on how much ur bto unit cost.,btohqsg

Is there a way to check the how much the SBF flats were previously sold for when they were launched as BTOs?Ie  their initial price vs current SBF price,btohqsg

The grant will be in ur cpf which can be used to pay for downpayment provided ur grant application is completely during the unit selection.,btohqsg
