üöÄPika World Update- 30 September 2021‚úàÔ∏èüßØ3 Reasons why Higher Bond Yields are Negative for Tech StocksTechnology stocks have been on a volatile ride. As a result  we have received numerous questions on the impact of higher bond yield on high growth stocks. Hence  in this episode  we will review three core reasons.‚öôÔ∏è#1: A rotation to Value PlayA higher yields environment often means that tech stocks tend to lag value stocks. The higher yield on long-dated bonds means investors expected higher inflation due to strong economic demand. As we know  value stocks are large mature companies that are dependent on firm economic demands for their earnings growth.We have seen that manufacturers and financial companies tend to be economic sensitive value stocks. So when investors load up stocks in these sectors  they tend to sell their tech holdings and rotate to these value companies.‚åõÔ∏è#2: Growth Stocks Had a Good Run  till the gas is offWe have seen growth stocks outpacing value stocks for some months  making growth shares relatively more expensive. The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG) had climbed by about 6.1% since 2H2021  much higher than its value counterpart (VOOV) of 1.1% gain.Therefore  we seek value stocks to catch up as some investors have been expecting  consistent with Pika World's mid-cycle transition phase narrative.üîÆ#3: A substantial discount on future profitsHigher yields imply a larger discount on future profits for a company. For many of the growth stocks  they tend to be losing money in the short term. The nature of such companies is that they tend to invest heavily to create future profit.The future earning streams of such growth stocks is often seen less valuable as when compared with the yield on a safe asset such as a Treasury bond. While it is also notable that higher yields can negatively impact value stocks  they tend to hurt growth stocks valuation more.As such  Pika World is monitoring the play out as we have hedge our portfolio to ride on this cycle.üìÆWhat's on the Menu Today?At 8.30 pm  we will have the GDP (QoQ)  which we expect to remain at 6.6%.We will also receive the Initial Jobless Claims  which may hold at around 335K  comparable to the prior period.Several FOMC members will speak. This includes Bostic and Harker speaking at 11 pm and 11.30 pm  respectively. Then we have Chicago Fed President Evans speaking at 12.30 am. They may shed light on their insights on economic growth and inflation outlook that could be a market mover.It is 30 September  Thursday  at 7.37 am in Singapore and 7.37 pm in New York. It is the last trading day of the month. What a wild and adrenaline-packed ride. Pika World hopes every friends a wonderful and enchanting day ahead.,btohqsg
