My rm worded it as bank has their own assessment criteria (ie not telling you). But if topup to $200k he has a better case (suggested sure can approve) for annual fee waiver.Suspect it is a tactic to get small priority banking accounts to top up assets.,btohqsg
Instant for me. (Existing scb credit card holder),btohqsg
I'm new user . Still waiting approve,btohqsg
New user have to assess your profile and limits. So slower.Existing card holder just tag on a new card. No changes to limits or review needed.Not sure if credit bureau gets a ping / free report though. I think yes.,btohqsg
Hi all. Good day. I hope to gather some opinions here on investing my savings for passive income. Assuming you have 400k cash. How would you invest or save while preserving capital? Bearing in mind that out of 400k  50k has to be liquid in view of emergency use.,btohqsg
Can refer to this and get some ideashttps://youtu.be/2wjuAXSqvHg?si=MTjSSXrST-QszjmE,btohqsg
Bros .. can I check esaver scb is work same way as uob stash account?,btohqsg

I have already watched this for some ideas. But don't have monthly salary  so no go for UOB One savings account.,btohqsg
if preserve capital is your priority  first i would believe to max out all the high yield savings account  then next would be investing in tbills or money market funds.,btohqsg
Can I ask  if I want to participate 6 months T bills for upcoming using cash say $100k.. can I register first even if the cash is not in the bank yet? Probably will only be in next week,btohqsg
UOB one do not in salary from the company,btohqsg
you can send money from another one of your accounts as salary and UOB is fine with it,btohqsg
the next one will only be open on 12th june and close on 20th june. so why not wait for the money to be in then register?,btohqsg
Oh I thought there is a 30 May one? Okok maybe I will wait for 12 June instead,btohqsg
its closing in like 2 days,btohqsg
Bro. Means hsbc ega . 3% ++. Still better than scb esaver ?,btohqsg
What you asking? First you ask SCB eSaver and UOB Stash  suddenly you ask HSBC EGA?,btohqsg
Can someone share how to do the salary hack?,btohqsg
I checking is scb esaver better or similar to hsbc EGA in terms of annual interest earn,btohqsg
Oic. Interesting to know about this,btohqsg
If you don't have 2 person to control  just rotate the money each month between EGA (odd months) n Esaver (even months). This is not financial advise. üòÜ,btohqsg
I mean similar interest rate earn,btohqsg
Similar if exclude the additional 1% for EGA incremental.,btohqsg
CIMB Starsavers is offering 3.5% promo for June/July. Another option,btohqsg
Hihi.. can I check when does hsbc ega credit their normal interest? I know the incremental interest is after the promotion  ends,btohqsg
Also may I know when will they credit the everyday+ for GIRO ?,btohqsg
Ya. Sad. Didn't check cimb after they change to tier based interest earlier part of the year.,btohqsg
Hi guys  for those saver accounts like UOB One  Ocbc 360  SC saver  which is the best if i have 2 person  2 salary crediting  100k each?,btohqsg
Is OCBC the best cause i used the online calculator  i can get 4.1% by just salary crediting and increase average balance by 500 monthly with 100k  and this can be doubled if i have 2 accounts  no hassle of spending credit card or online giro etc.Any comments if i am considering this right?,btohqsg
if only those two things  then you might be right. I know UOB One will not pay that much for sure,btohqsg
Any suggestion on t bill 6 month cut off yield? Thanks,btohqsg
Hihi if I use Kris+ link to uob lady(travel)  also means I get 4+1 mpd ? I've decided to split my payment to maximize rewards,btohqsg
See point 2 of the msg you replied to,btohqsg
Will there be a switch in mcc if I use Kris+ to pay ?,btohqsg
For travel agency somehow mcc change,btohqsg
I see...but krisflyer uob card can use in conjunction with Kris+ not affecting the final reward 3+1 mpd?,btohqsg
UOB KF gets 3mpd as long as it's Kris+,btohqsg
Oh ya . You're right   missed out on that part,btohqsg
Amount will be debited from your account at the point of application,btohqsg
The upcoming one is closing tomorrow 9pm if using DBS,btohqsg
Without spending  you'll get 4.05% p.a. for 100k. Note that you'll get slightly lesser EIR if you have lesser or more than 100k. Best is to keep the EIR above 4% (UOB One account 150k gets 4% p.a. with just $500 spend and salary crediting). You also need have a reset month  which loses you 1.5% p.a. instantly (or whatever EIR the account give  wherever you transfer your monies to).98k = 4% p.a.100k = 4.05% p.a.101.5k = 3.99% p.a.If you have 2 humans with HSBC EGA  you get up to 4.45% p.a. (depending on promo) for amounts up to 360k. Just need to alternate the combined amount of 200k between each account. Only criteria is 2k deposit (fulfilled when you alternate account) and 5 outward transactions  and SMS registration for promo.,btohqsg
The next one will open 12 June and close on 19 June,btohqsg
And you also don‚Äôt have to do the $500 monthly increment. It takes effort to do that and having to reset periodically,btohqsg
"Have you tried searching ""UOB One salary credit""?",btohqsg
The EGA incremental average daily balance is max $2m instead of $360k,btohqsg
1% p.a. from Everyday+ Rewards only applies to first $300 (estimated 360k).,btohqsg
Do chris have any promotions link for this hsbc EGA. I can't find at his link,btohqsg
Does it mean that if premier  then the 1% is capped at approx $600k cos $500 Cashback? If there is other Cashback  like giro  then the incremental ADB is even lower?,btohqsg
Yes. I can't find the link for hsbc EGA account at chris link,btohqsg
