Na bro if they weren't scolded for that they would be scolded for just another thing instead,btohqsg
One attending was going into a tirade on a House Officer about how the tendon hammer was a separate instrument and how the use of a stethoscope would be unable to test deep tendon reflexes on it,btohqsg
i don't get the joke eh,btohqsg
Humless.. blood cockles are added into char kuay teow.. its also a play on words cuz Humless and Harmless,btohqsg
I could tell the latter but i didn't understand what it has anything to do with the food...,btohqsg
ah makes sense. no wonder i couldnt tell,btohqsg
Hum is a colloquial term for Blood Cockles,btohqsg
yeah ive no idea what blood cockles mean,btohqsg
It's a type of shell fish similar to clams,btohqsg
OHHHHbut i didnt know why they were all saying hum and all of that stuffso probably had something to do with the post,btohqsg
wow  my bad for asking so much questionsi really don't know lots of stuff :'),btohqsg
Na the comments section is just NSFs making a joke about their own situation,btohqsg
Or themselves it's kinda the same thing,btohqsg
lol typical comment section on social media thatsnottwitter,btohqsg
Na it's fine I just find it incumbent upon me to ascertain as to what your background is whereby you didn't understand common parlance in regards to Singaporean food in general.,btohqsg
I am unable to even read the comments section as I do not possess a Instagram account,btohqsg
i mean singaporean food is goodand no im not a foreigner im actually a singaporeanmaybe im not aware of the sg related memes/jokes here  thats why...,btohqsg
Ngl ah i feel my friends are not as extroverted or as close as other friend groups,btohqsg
They dont want to go overseas or clubbing or anything like that. At most is movie or eat outside,btohqsg
or it feels like they have closer friend groups,btohqsg
maybe lazy to go out? or their schedule is busy,btohqsg
while all I have is them,btohqsg
Perhaps my sentence might seem sesquipedalian in nature but I merely am simply expressing my inquisitive nature due to the ubiquitous use of a large variety of such words in our everyday life's whereby a normal Singaporean with a decent aptitude for interaction would be exposed to such vocabulary,btohqsg
sesquipedalianA1 for o level english ðŸ’¯im willing to bet my life,btohqsg
oh damnwell my english is awfulso clearly im not that exposed,btohqsg
I got a C6 for my English  hang on just a moment while I reset my language and typing style to something a little more layman,btohqsg
looks like i need to diesince i said im betting my life,btohqsg
Ah OK this one just means u everyday walk around u order kopi c gao kosong also need to get such vocab one what,btohqsg
How do you have so much energy,btohqsg
I go to the auntie ask to Cook me char kuay teow without Hum the auntie immediately understand one,btohqsg
Huh? What u mean by so much energy typing require a lot of energy meh?,btohqsg
yup they ask me if I want that thing in laksa,btohqsg
damn you found me on discord,btohqsg
Ya la Laksa also use Hum for flavour limpeh prefer to eat it blanch and serve as is with lime cuz its that delicious,btohqsg
But hearsay can kena Hepatitis from such things one so limpeh a bit scared la if u see the auntie the food hygiene macam cmi then don't order,btohqsg
maybe i should start using google,btohqsg
holy shit why did i take so long to realize what that was,btohqsg
It's liver got tachi so Inflame lor cuz trying to tell u got problem,btohqsg
my mess hall laksa during bmt sedap,btohqsg
yea i heard my parents say eating that too much is awful for your health,btohqsg
I tried to order with extra Hum before its a 50/50 coin flip one depending on if the auntie happy then u can get it if not you get told to fuck off,btohqsg
so if i were to buy laksa again ill probably not ask for that,btohqsg
or extra then they give only 1...,btohqsg
Not really it's merely a reflect of what blood cockles is.. a shellfish which by naturally harbours a large array of parasites and bacteria,btohqsg
the time i bought char siew rice  extra $2 for roasted chicken  auntie only gave 4 small piecesðŸ˜«,btohqsg
Some is if u ask extra they minus from you arh anyways I suspects its a reflection of current market price,btohqsg
Cuz the price of Hum increasing more than game stop in 2021,btohqsg
ohh does it live in mud or somethingbecause why would it be so infested,btohqsg
All shell fishes live in the mud.. they are filter feeders.. picture where would one get a clam,btohqsg
no wonder i remember my parents mentioning that,btohqsg
