Is maybank f&f card has 8% on singtel payment?Seems singtel on web page and in app are a bit different? I saw axs mark in singtel app,btohqsg
Don't use the app. Axs wont earn rewards.,btohqsg
think you got to pick telco benefits before tagging singtel payments credit card giro on that F&F  if its not a selected benefit  then you get nothing,btohqsg
Okay. Then i just use the web page to pay it,btohqsg

Sorry for stupid question- when using kris+ to pay  what's the mcc code? Which card can get best cash back and miles now using kris+?,btohqsg
Hi all  I searched in the chat about pumping petrol in Malaysia and it seems like the best card for miles is amaze + CRMC  is this correct?I believe UOB PPV works too if the terminal accepts contactless Apple Pay? Also UOB Prvi could be a good backup with 3mpd for spend in Malaysia? Just checking if thereâ€™s any other miles card for petrol in Malaysia that I could have missed.,btohqsg
I got$100 credit from dbs altitude for Nov spent and reflected to my Dec statement  but they not use the credit to minus the credit card balance in Dec and Jan. anyone have the same experience?,btohqsg
hello  so my application got automatically rejected by their system. Called the bank and they advised me to increase my credit rating to AA before applying again  and they couldnt help me find a reason why it got rejected.,btohqsg
try other banks? like maybe GxS or trust or Maritry to raise score to get some rating,btohqsg
Go for cards in other banks to increase your credit rating first. DBS  OCBC and UOB would be the easiest.Then probably try again with Citibank next year when AY25 assessable income is ready.,btohqsg
I tried citi and amaze on Petronas station  always get rejected. Also if you use SG issued card  system will block you from pumping Ron 95Counter inside not willing to do petrol transaction.,btohqsg
Use Google or apple pay will work,btohqsg
Really? They are easier than Citiâ€¦..,btohqsg
Hi guys  Iâ€™m gonna purchase a big item from audio house. I have Citi Bank + amaze and Dbswwmc.If I use krisplus > Apple Pay > dbswwmc or AMAZE  can i confirm that for both   I will enjoy the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Why your credit score is GX? Perhaps you need to find out this first  instead of bank gives you the reason. Because it is abnormal.,btohqsg
i applied it as my first credit card  and when it got rejected i saw on cbs report that my credit score was GX,btohqsg
Are you a foreigner working in SG?,btohqsg
nope  singaporean  working for a year already,btohqsg
Which bank account do you have now?,btohqsg
The is nothing wrong with having a GX score.It just needs one bank to take a leap of faith to grant credit.Having said that CBS credit score isnot the onlycriteria banks use to evaluate risk. There are others.,btohqsg
Where do u credit ur salary? Can get a card there first.,btohqsg
ok i'll look into it  but i just switched my salary crediting to ocbcðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 acct? Can get ocbc credit card first and clock 500$ spend too for higher interest.,btohqsg
Hi all  after I max out $1k for amaze + citi rewards  what is the next best CC combo for daily spend to accumulate miles?,btohqsg
Online or offline? Usually people will navigate towards stack of UOB cc,btohqsg
hmm ok  but do i have to wait another 3-6 months to apply again?not sure if it will badly affect credit scores if i apply for another bank after a rejection,btohqsg
Id suggest waiting before applying again for citi,btohqsg
Ocbc cuz u have salary w them,btohqsg
oki  but then need to wait for a few months?,btohqsg
With all due respect I donâ€™t think anyone in this group can guarantee your next application can be approved or waiting not waiting helps unless the person is a risk policy person who knows all the rules n knows your full profile.So the best is for a trial n error.,btohqsg
What Citi told you is a hint hint already,btohqsg
Hi guys  Iâ€™m gonna purchase a big item from audio house. I have Citi Bank + amaze and Dbswwmc.If I use krisplus > Apple Pay > dbswwmc or AMAZE  can i confirm that for both   I will enjoy the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Can but dont exceed the cap 1.5k and 1k respectively,btohqsg
Hi! Which travel visa card to accumulate miles would be recommended for someone whose credit card expenditure is about $800++,btohqsg
depends what kind of things you spend on  if just looking for general spending  citirewards (with amaze) or uob PPV are 2 cards that come to mind,btohqsg
For me  Citi-rewards with amaze for general spending and UOB lady card for travel related expenses.,btohqsg

But usually uob lady card. U wouldn't spend all the time for travel am I right. If not travelling the card is useless right,btohqsg
I do short or long travels every 2-3 months. So this card will work for me.,btohqsg
Ohnice. I'm stuck with not having a card for travel. As I usually only have travel twice a year,btohqsg
I find UOB lady card a balance to meet all needs. There is no minimum spending requirement to unlock bonus. The 4 miles per dollar is quite easy to get,btohqsg
