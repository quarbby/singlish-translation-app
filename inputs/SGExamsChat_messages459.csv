bc I honestly have no idea what this tuition grant thingy is abt,btohqsg
Long time ago liao but if you're SC you're defo eligible for tuition grant as long as you didn't break the law,btohqsg
I think I saw on reddit just need to sign the form,btohqsg
PR or international student-wise  just be aware need serve 3 year bond by working in SG,btohqsg
This also applies for A level kids applying for uni btw,btohqsg
as one which I just nice meet igp,btohqsg

not safe but just do it,btohqsg
i dun even rmb what it was,btohqsg
I am guessing is for 90rp ppl,btohqsg
wth can change course and 2 years housing,btohqsg
sounds too good to be true,btohqsg
i think its gonna kill anyone below 85,btohqsg
is competition for uni lesser for poly students than jc kids or still same,btohqsg
for the sake of going Uni,btohqsg
did you go plane spotting tdy?,btohqsg
I‚Äôll never get to be a pilot,btohqsg

Not any diploma can go any major tho,btohqsg
worse comes to worse is literally biz which is still 3.5 for nus,btohqsg
the not so well known Uni I never check yet,btohqsg
I will force myself to believe that I am for the best,btohqsg
In fact no. of placements reserved for poly grads is lesser,btohqsg
Now more and more poly grads aim to go uni coz they know without a degree they will get hardstucked in most places,btohqsg
If want be pilot I think need to study additional,btohqsg
My friends did mid for Os went poly then easily got in nus cs,btohqsg
so anything is possible depends on the person,btohqsg
Unless you meant they scored so well that their GPA can easily enter,btohqsg
But to get that GPA is not easy,btohqsg
But no matter where you go  what route is left for you  make the most out of it,btohqsg
the only thing i want is free hotpot,btohqsg
for clarification  I am the OG pocoyo .. unless there was someone else..? Hmm,btohqsg
the pocoyo who loves this sticker,btohqsg
Guys y‚Äôall want the quote of the day?,btohqsg
quote of the day: the day you board a Ryanair flight is the day you‚Äôve absolutely lost your mind your shit your life your sanity your happiness,btohqsg
Quote of the day: Go to the gym to become Jim  so that girls will go to the gym to squad on Jim.,btohqsg

You know what else gets hugged every night? My Mother,btohqsg
sounds a little too close to home,btohqsg
Btw  this is a small part of my hot wheels collection,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt remember if I posted this b4...but yes this is my hobby  pocoyo like planes  r like money and a job...and I like cars,btohqsg
I think I have nearly 1000 cars right now,btohqsg
That is realistic hot wheels only,btohqsg

The last time I really took a photo of 2/3 my collection,btohqsg

I also have a collection of tomicas,btohqsg
I rmb once my father asked me why I bought ice Milo at a coffee shop,btohqsg

I see  how you manage your expenses?,btohqsg
By that response  you prob don‚Äôt,btohqsg
ok shut up I have $100 left ok happy?,btohqsg
can't manage expenses if no money,btohqsg
The price of HDb‚Äôs are scaring me a little,btohqsg
Is a 3.8-3.85 enough for a scholarship in the Big 3,btohqsg
I‚Äôm living in a 5 rm  my parents paid 300k for it 20 yrs ago,btohqsg
the fuvk I gotta be a millionaire to buy a hdb,btohqsg
My 5 room HDB was 550k,btohqsg
BTO is worth it even if i'm going overseas eventually,btohqsg
Yea  but not easy to find 5rm that actually give the space of a 5rm in the meet hdbs,btohqsg
The recent Paya Lebar overhaul increased the price,btohqsg
eh wait BTO I can leave it vacant for 5 years then rent out or must stay,btohqsg
Tbh the only reason why Singapore is worth staying in is the healthcare,btohqsg
I rmb starting  very big reddit post abt a yr ago,btohqsg
I said that ‚ÄúSingapore is a place to work not to live‚Äù,btohqsg
I started a whole discussion because of that,btohqsg
you think over here is mad....,btohqsg
you haven't seen enough of the world,btohqsg
in 20 years time  the upper middle class totally wiped out and go overseas to work/study etc,btohqsg
What frightens me is that despite the price of hdbs  the government still can loose money,btohqsg
In USA a good education is insanely expensive,btohqsg
Imagine if it‚Äôs bevause PAP is sucking money out of the taxes üëÄüëÄ,btohqsg
Another thing I‚Äôm surprise is that 7rm hdb‚Äôs are prices the same as resale 5 rooms,btohqsg
7 room HDBs are usually quite old,btohqsg
So the lease is shorter hence lower value,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt make HDBs like they used to,btohqsg
I have a classmate they lives in a double mansionette,btohqsg
Basically two mansionettes . With its common wall knocked down,btohqsg
my old flat at pasir ris probs worth a lot now,btohqsg
Mansionette yes it‚Äôs jumbo but Two story,btohqsg
So nobody that received this year had?,btohqsg
Let me see if I can find a listing of one,btohqsg
I‚Äôm pretty sure they are priced the same as a 5 room resale,btohqsg
Back when there used to be space in Singapore,btohqsg
Before all this 10 million target population bullshit,btohqsg
guys  wld u buy a 999 years land or freehold..,btohqsg

but if you wanted a better RP you'd not take H2 geog,btohqsg
is he an old fuck or counted young someone tell me,btohqsg
Floor plan of a jumbo mansionette,btohqsg
Aiya don‚Äôt focus on the school,btohqsg
Less than 50% 67.5rp and above  14 80rp and above  88.75rp highest,btohqsg
Just focus on your own performance,btohqsg
If you know you‚Äôre at 80RP level it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre in RI or MI,btohqsg
eh pls you always call people this,btohqsg
The alphabet in front of the institute isn‚Äôt everything,btohqsg
it‚Äôs not a lot of time,btohqsg
My senior who I rlly though will do well,btohqsg
but let me be like real ah,btohqsg
I really don‚Äôt think the government will allow a HDb to finish its full 99 yrs,btohqsg
effort doesn't always translate to results,btohqsg
pls...i want to be old soon...especially the upcoming 2 years,btohqsg
Ye here‚Äôs the reason why school does matter,btohqsg
The oldest hdbs are already bent knocked down,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt focus on MI‚Äôs prelims HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Btw y‚Äôall know where is the next HDb Enbloc?,btohqsg
Other school‚Äôs prelims to determine your standard,btohqsg
I heard MI has pretty bad faculties,btohqsg
oh that‚Äôs actually not that bad,btohqsg
whai does Joseph not respond to old fk im beyond heartbroken,btohqsg

Yikes I sense some competition in this telegram,btohqsg
guys Joseph js called me an old fuck and asked me if I was in Uni,btohqsg
i was that desperate LOLL   got D for whole of J2,btohqsg
We did not know much...all we knew was we needed to do our best,btohqsg
Then I read somewhere on Reddit some senior saying that the people in my cohort will miss Os in the future,btohqsg
my econs cher even called me at 9pm ask me go school see her tmr do essay,btohqsg
Cause if we failed o‚Äôs we wasted  whole year,btohqsg
Cause sec 5 is stopping soon,btohqsg
salute to her ah but at that point i was like ''NOOO'',btohqsg
Very soon everybody will only go through 4 years of sec school education,btohqsg
Uni always seems so far away,btohqsg
my friends told me it was so long that after a while they just wanted to get over it instead of being stressed,btohqsg
BRUH why am I famous in here FOR H2 GEOG,btohqsg
uni is so close yet...so far,btohqsg
DONT TAG ME AND NO ONE WILL KNOW,btohqsg
because . ok fine you‚Äôre the prettiest girl.. wait no prettiest h2 GEOGRAPHER IN THIS GC OMG ü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèª‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
pocoyo I love ur ass tooüòç,btohqsg
god it sounds absurd without context,btohqsg
god we all love pocoyo‚Äôs ass don‚Äôt we,btohqsg
trust me it's closer than you think,btohqsg
then very fast uni also over alr,btohqsg
if i can make it  anyone can....,btohqsg
true but tbh just don't think so much,btohqsg
no more n level pain tho,btohqsg
They are basically treating everyone the same,btohqsg
don't scared about whether you'll make it  just do,btohqsg
But they are renaming how each student s categorised,btohqsg
How to save money during NS. It is hard,btohqsg
think this way: aim 90 rp and you‚Äôll get 80 ah that‚Äôs right W,btohqsg
no kuro we‚Äôre not saying anything,btohqsg
ok aim 95 then ms h2 geographer,btohqsg
sorry I changed my pocoyo name again,btohqsg
ya no shit I‚Äôm using the most burette logic possible,btohqsg
have you heard of the DHS legend,btohqsg
he took 3H2 and 3H1 and 1H3,btohqsg
Basically from what I gather  instead of grading students on their performance  they are now starting to grade the kind of subjects the students take,btohqsg
BCMe + H1 geo + H3 + PW + GP,btohqsg
A level results come out  9 distinctions,btohqsg
what course are you aiming for,btohqsg
at that time   DHS allowed top IP scorers to take 1 more subject,btohqsg
I had a sec school Friend get 4 distinctions in o levels... decide to retake sec 5  now in ite,btohqsg
his h1 were econs + geo + gp + pw,btohqsg
this is bloody useless cock it‚Äôs js to prevent like ‚Äòoh I was from NA‚Äô bcz honestly there‚Äôs not much stigma as soon as this was implemented like a lot of kids mixed around. I won‚Äôt Say I vast majority but like yk there‚Äôs q abit of mixing around like they mix mix in the baking mixer thing oh god help me again.,btohqsg
so he had 1 more subject than a normal person,btohqsg
LOL which batch is it ah,btohqsg
He did not know what he wanted to do,btohqsg
What kind of logic is that,btohqsg
Man‚Äôs never heard of a gap year,btohqsg
fr fr stigma on the style,btohqsg
It means those that go to ITE will really be considered stupid,btohqsg
I think I‚Äôve said this before but I think a very good reason ite has a bad stigma is cause of its foundation years,btohqsg
Can mingle with all the high achievers yet still end up in ITE,btohqsg
Fr the first few years after it was established  psle students could enrol into ite,btohqsg
Imagine 12 yr olds with knives and access to machinery,btohqsg
No wonder got such a bad stigma,btohqsg
I personally think pharm sci more fun,btohqsg
As what my mother like to say,btohqsg
I hate science courses in poly,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt understand how people can handle those,btohqsg
can still go into pharm (industrial) with chem degree or not ah?,btohqsg
My Friend finished his y1  asked him what he did...bro was like  I created a candle,btohqsg
And u can sit back and count money,btohqsg

Ya why ur mother say that,btohqsg
The best is engineering students....asked a girl  she said...I learnt how to fold a plane,btohqsg
1 yr later  I know how to fold a plane,btohqsg
I have a rp lecturer that told one of my friends to ‚Äúask Google  why ask me‚Äù,btohqsg
When he asked a qns to him,btohqsg
I‚Äôm quite curious on how their learning system and ungraded internship works,btohqsg
it was my initial plan ah  chem,btohqsg
From what I can gather  you use rp to try and secure s future job through internship,btohqsg
The best route as a rp student is to try and secure a job through intern,btohqsg
Secure a job offer through the ungraded internship,btohqsg
That is gonna be the best route you possibly can go via rp,btohqsg
Yea  cause that is more likely than not gonna be your peak,btohqsg
Because I see their track team,btohqsg
Rp is not very well recognised poly in the corporate world,btohqsg
Having so much time to commit to training,btohqsg
Yea  the issue is cause our exams are open book,btohqsg
Or at least most of the students I see,btohqsg
Y1 is open bookY2 is one piece of paper,btohqsg
But again it's harder to score,btohqsg
So the best prospect for RP is securing a job through the ungraded internship,btohqsg
Since the % of people going to local uni is single digit,btohqsg
Could possibly because their threshold is like 26,btohqsg
Or do Ur own external intern xd,btohqsg
With my gpa of 1.67 in sem1  I manage to go sem 2,btohqsg
And I did not remod a single module,btohqsg
I heard stories of even 1.2 going to sem 2,btohqsg

Guys y‚Äôall know there are at least 10 vacant schools in Sg right now?,btohqsg
At least 30 vacant HDb blocks around the island,btohqsg
I quit gaming a long long time ago,btohqsg
Nowadays when ppl talk abt gaming   it ‚Äòs all abt the refresh rates on the screen,btohqsg
hello I‚Äôm back what‚Äôs up now,btohqsg
ok now is gaming I leave,btohqsg
Gaming is useful in understanding the metaverse,btohqsg
Because a ton of Web 3.0 concepts can be experienced through games,btohqsg
I have returned to my OG identity,btohqsg
