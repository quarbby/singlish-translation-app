Can pay cc bill by UOB AMEX?,btohqsg
Yes. Did this myself. I agree nothing to lose. If u need it back to your old bank acct  can just switch again after 3 months. üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi all  sorry if this question was already asked. What is the best between citi rewards + amaze vs. HSBC revo card?For me I see both are 4mpd cards so for everyday if I apply to only one  which one should I go for?,btohqsg
Main difference to me is Citi rewards exclude airlines n hotels.,btohqsg
I see  so because citi needs to be linked to amaze to work everywhere + exclude airlines and hotels.. HSBC is the better option? Is it a good card for a beginner?,btohqsg
oh citi rewards card doesnt give rewards for airlines and hotel spending?,btohqsg
My personal take is to use CRMC as primary  HSBC Revo as secondary because sometimes  some shops just dont fall within the MCC but are well.. part of life.Examples:- Haircut- See doctor- Pet supplies (assuming u dont buy from Shopee)- Telco payment- Service subscription like Netflix  Spotify [if not using SC Smart]Don't think u are travelling every time also rightüòÖ,btohqsg
Between UOB PRVI cards  which one do you recommend? AMEX  Visa or MC?,btohqsg
May I know why I can‚Äôt trade forex in Webull? It only available for viewing  there‚Äôs no trade button over thr,btohqsg
just to confirm  CRMC refers to citibank rewards mastercard?,btohqsg
Yes  also CRMC covers items like online polyclinic/public hospital payment from HealthHub which HSBC revo doesn‚Äôt cover. Also miles expire in 5 years compared to 3 years for HSBC revoVice versa HSBC revo covers travel spend  subject to 1k monthly spending cap of 4MPD,btohqsg
so between CRMC and citi cashback+ mastercard which has more benefits when using amaze?,btohqsg
CRMC if you convert points to cash  it is about 2.27% cashback  while cashback+ is 1.6% (2.0% if you have a Citi plus account).,btohqsg
Hi I have query regarding great eastern ilp great wealth advantage 3. This plan consist of a insurance portion and investment portion  however it does not have any fees regarding the insurance portion. Also does it means that 100% of the premium will go to investments after minus all the management fees. Thanks,btohqsg
I'm not entirely sure with UOB  but I won't take AMEX due to lack of support as much as the other two. Will take Mc over VISA due to support with Amaze(I'm assuming all these cards work the exact same way  and they cannot be used for public transport),btohqsg
Thank you! Understand that the difference is no travel expenses coverage for CRMC + less eligible merchants for HSBC + 5yrs miles expiry for CRMC vs 3yrs miles expiry HSBC.I‚Äôll consider HSBC because I actually would use the travel expenses but don‚Äôt spend enough daily to use 2 cards,btohqsg
No min spend for both cards so doesn't matter can slowly accumulate. If u think after 3 years still not enough miles to travel .. then u shld be going fr cashback cards instead,btohqsg
To me  I dont have Netflix n pet. Telco payment has other better option depends on promo. Medical is covered by company.  Haircut shop dont except credit card(neighbour type).So my airlines + hotel expenses > the rest of expenses in a year.,btohqsg
AMEX has bonus points + limo. But agree about acceptance,btohqsg
The benefit you get out of HSBC Revo is the 1% cashback from HSBC Everyday+ Programme and thats pretty much it. Oh  and why I will suggest HSBC Revo as secondary is because there's no Annual Fee on it too unlike CRMC so.. better to use CRMC more actively too,btohqsg
Is there any card besides UOB Absolute Cashback that hasn't excluded SAM?,btohqsg
Hi i just joined last week and observe people here doesnt discuss about investing in equity. Am i right? Is there another channel or any community recommendations that can join or learn from?,btohqsg

Hi  I go JB like twice a month. I always exchange cash and also spend around $120 per trip. What is the best way to spend money or exchange cash?,btohqsg
You can look at Kelvin's channel att.me/kelvinvestfor equties  options and stock market discussions,btohqsg
For credit card  take a look at amaze wallet 4% instapoints  will discuss in upcoming video.E-wallet can use touch n goCash can withdraw from Trust bank,btohqsg
Thank you Chris. Have a great weekend ahead,btohqsg
Hey Chris  I only start to watch your video a few days ago. Now i watch about 2-4 of your videos everyday.I dont  like to accumulate points. I usually go for cash rebates. My thinking is that u exchange point for travel ticket  you will end up spending more.,btohqsg
For this  you can ask@mttelegrammtwho recently just converted from a cashback fanatic to miles user now,btohqsg
haha thanks for the shoutout..i am still Team Value where I will choose the proposition that makes most sense.My opinion is:6mpd cards no need argue. Confirm win any cashback card.4mpd cards are on par with 8% cashback cards.2mpd cards win those 1.6% cashback cards.But one thing for sure is you are definitely still paying more than the economy ticket cash price when you redeem a business class ticket. (based on the cashback given up). Kind of forced upselling but you are getting a business class ticket at much lower than it would have cost with cash.,btohqsg
But one thing is for sure.. getting the Elusive Saver Business class redemption is going to be much much harder than the cashback that you see credited into your credit card account.,btohqsg
apples with apples! SQ TICKET TO JAPAN!!!,btohqsg
I not so interested in Japan Korea all these. My next dream destinations are Israel  Mozambique egypt and Tanzania.,btohqsg
I find those are journeys worth going lor bananas or no bananas,btohqsg
Go same place all the time v sian,btohqsg
see your preference loh.. my household likes to go the same old places... do familar things. more relax less surprises,btohqsg
Hmmm yah i can see why if have kids or if a bit older i would go familiar places. Safer  easier to get around. But i feel if still healthy should go and see the rest of the world. After all you only live once.,btohqsg
Me peasant don't see much value in business class tickets üòÇ,btohqsg
correct... no right no wrong..4mpd cards were not attractive enough to lure me to the darkside of J redemption. 6mpd was the one that kicked me over.i won't put all my eggs on one basket.. continue earning cashback on my high cashback cards.. and slowly earn 6mpd as priority  and using 4/3 mpd cards as and when needed.,btohqsg
For the UOB EVOL sign up promo  does the first 50 start from the sign up date or completion date of the requirements?,btohqsg
Anyone knows what time the dbs paylah 5 million hawker meals went out today? 12.45pm still have?,btohqsg
12:15pm I saw the fully redeemed banner,btohqsg
good video ! thanks for sharing !,btohqsg
Very depressed after seeing this video... Exactly the situation I m facing now... Lagging behind my peers üò≠,btohqsg
Just think have interest here and there cover expenses can already what for chase property cars all that,btohqsg
Working hard is prerequisite to success. Work hard and wait for the opportunity to come. U never know when the chance will come by,btohqsg
For those chasing FIRE  do u find it better to use Cashback or Miles Credit Cards?,btohqsg
Cashback. Because Miles causes u to spend more,btohqsg
need courage too. know of people who just don't have the courage when there are opportunities.,btohqsg
Hi for uob evol card paying caltex Go is it considered online payment?,btohqsg
I need to act. Looking for a stock to all in and make it big! There are so many opportunities  we just need to wait for the right time. Working hard at a job  waiting to get promotion  clearing shit work and navigating toxic politics  it's just too much to bear when the odds are stacked against you. Seriously.,btohqsg
why does HSBC revo point expire within a year?,btohqsg
Just curious how do u come to the valuation on 4mpd? I personally value 4mpd similar to 5% due to how common Cashback cards work,btohqsg
no no... my valuation now is 1.5x for economy redemption  2.5x for business redemption (but danger cannot grab)ECONOMY2mpd = 3% cashback4mpd = 6% cashback6mpd = 9% cashbackBUSINESS2mpd = 5% cashback.4mpd = 10% cashback6 mpd = 15% cashback,btohqsg
that is why i am so naggy and keep showing my calculations so I can be corrected in case i am wrong.Based entirely on the figures of:SG Japan Economy revenue ticket at $900 and requires 54k milesSG Japan Business revenue ticket at $3200 and requires 102k miles,btohqsg
Hope my above makes sense to u,btohqsg
No worries@mttelegrammt  thanks so much for sharing üòÅ,btohqsg
Please help! I have the same question,btohqsg
anyone tried buying tickets at Singapore Airlines? How come I have a ‚Äúbooking‚Äù when I have not paid anything. What happens if I cancel?,btohqsg
So the 50 people who took the shortest time from card approval date to spending $800 will get the watch Loh,btohqsg
My advice for this kind of first xx promo please don‚Äôt participate. Sure make yourself angry one unless u can fulfil within first day of card approval.,btohqsg
I am not sure either miles or cashback makes such a big difference in FIRE goals,btohqsg
Miles = spending?Cashback = saving?Haha. Superficial logic.,btohqsg
I meant in the grand scheme of FIRE  its not that important i guess. Probably doesnt make a whole lot of difference,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being biased in this statement.But those who play miles tend to enjoy the finer things in life?Those who play cashback tend to be more stingy?True? Or false?,btohqsg
HSBC Revo bonus points for April are in üòâ,btohqsg
Haha hmmm interesting take but i dont think so as i use mostly my miles for econ flights ü§£,btohqsg
life is a gamble of calculated risks,btohqsg
yes of course  but not All In.,btohqsg
Crypto winter is coming. Ponzi imploding.,btohqsg
Throughout history  people worked till they died. There are no shortcuts in life,btohqsg
life is all or nothing. investments on other hand is diversification üíØ,btohqsg
like spread around few projects u have high conviction in,btohqsg
time to load up guys. I think most people here are pursuing FIRE or financial freedom,btohqsg
I feel all in is not a good idea. Future is uncertain and best of us go wrong. With hindsight one can try to rationalize. e.g. Famous investor from US bought into textile industry and later found things were shifting to China because of cost arbitrage. And this in hindsight might look easy to predict. If best of us go wrong sometimes  must weigh options carefully before pulling the trigger,btohqsg
yes definitely  but the biggest risk in life is taking no risk. inflation forces us to take more calculated risks to achieve financial freedom. but ofc always DYOR,btohqsg
Your SQ ticket has been issued & confirmed rite? Your card payment will be confirmed and appear on statement date. That what happened to me.,btohqsg
I think Financial Independence  Retire Early (FIRE) has absolutely nothing to do with choice of credit cards or even to use credit or debit cards.It is a matter of personal conviction  convenience and lifestyle choices we as individuals make as u progress in age and through the life stages.,btohqsg
My read is first 50 to meet all requirements.,btohqsg
Hi  u should be back from Royal Caribbean cruise üòä. Can share what card u use onboard and the typical  MCC codes of the merchants onboard?,btohqsg
Can I check whether I can sign up for Kris+ using Chris referral code  top up my Amaze Wallet with $100 and spend at NTUC Finest to get $15 (2250 miles) and the sure win instant rewards?,btohqsg
Hey! Yes I‚Äôm back :) hmmm but I used the 4% Cashback promo from using Amaze wallet! Is there a way to check the MCC for these transactions?If yes I‚Äôll gladly look through and share here!,btohqsg
Riding on this. The SC rebranded Journey card states 3mpd for Royal Carribean too. But not sure if it's only for booking of tickets or also expenses onboard. Anyone managed to confirm?,btohqsg
Thanks for replying =) I think you can go to your Amaze app to check the categories of your transactions.For me  I use Amaze linked to CRMC in Japan. I noticed a couple of my transactions were wrongly categorised.,btohqsg
Purchase of ntuc voucher on kris + can only use the miles inside to pay for it. U cant use card to pay for the voucher,btohqsg
Thanks for answering my question and also my next question. You seem to guess my next question before I write here haha,btohqsg
Hi gurus  are XNAP transactions considered retail by OCBC 365 credit card?,btohqsg
Anyone knows touch n go e wallet (mobile app) can use like contactless (tap) at tolls? Also assuming i wont have mobile data,btohqsg

Is the DBS Taka card approval instant?,btohqsg
Up for discussion.With the recent change to Revolut topup fees  does Youtrip/Revolut still have a use case?I think think and I think after I clear my current Foreign Currency stash inside Youtrip I will stop using it.Main thoughts:1. no more rewards for topping up Youtrip or Revolut2. whatever is topped up into Youtrip or Revolut is losing value at 4% p.a. (bank savings rate)3. other competitors like Amaze and Trust are superior (yes their spreads are lousy but still have positive net benefit MOST of the time)The only time I will use Youtrip/Revolut is if Amaze fails (e.g. transaction fail and behind got long queue stare at you) or when the transaction is under SGD10 equivalent.,btohqsg
Hey folks For SQ booking through SIA portal  can Krisflyer miles be drawn from two KrisFlyer accounts for a single itinerary ?For example  A books a 2 Pax itinerary (Pax A + Pax B) for a return ticket to Tokyo. Pax A and Pax B EACH has their respective Krisflyer account. Can the Krisflyer miles be drawn from Pax A‚Äòs Krisflyer account and likewise for Pax B?Thanks! =),btohqsg
you log into your kf account and searched for tickets right? its just that they save the search in case you wanna go in and confirm book la. i had it also when i trying to find which flight to book,btohqsg
I believe it is cannot.The only 'sharing of miles' is you can use Person A's miles to book for Person B if Person B is an official nominee input.,btohqsg
Nice! Sorry but if possible  can you provide me w a SS so I can find where‚Äôs the MCC code?,btohqsg
I can cancel with no penalty? Yes  I logged onto my KF account,btohqsg
Japan is very famous for Monkey MCC. I usually prefer to use a General Spending card in Japan when tagging onto Amaze.Especially dining places  most of the time it has a nonsense MCC like railway company (owner of the building) or it has electronic services MCC.Supermarkets might be correct grocery MCC though.,btohqsg
If XNAP is eligible for EVOL  it should not be excluded from 365 as well,btohqsg
Still need the card. But you can try the Touch n go RFID tag  much better,btohqsg
I've seen a discussion on keeping Revolut MC for Japan cash withdrawals because there's a fee for visa withdrawal in japan atms,btohqsg
yes of course. its just there for you so you no need key everything again if want to proceed,btohqsg
Doesn't work  what you can do is add a Redemption nominee to the account where you want to redeem krisflyer miles  then you can redeem flights for both pax,btohqsg
Do you know if it is possible to gift or transfer miles from Person A to Person B  especially if Person B is an official nominee?,btohqsg
I don't know of any  if there is then there will be a miles market already,btohqsg
But it's a good idea for an accm topic,btohqsg
Hi all Any cc that I can use to earn cashback or miles for pru and aia premium?,btohqsg
Buy voo or s27? Both have 30% dividend tax. Which one has higher commission upon trade?,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing.  I just came back from Hokkaido. I use my Amaze at one restaurant in Sapporo. The category on my Amaze app is ‚ÄòUtility‚Äô.,btohqsg
Having said that  I observed that the categories for some shopping places are shown as dining. But that‚Äôs fine for me.,btohqsg
one method i do is after the first transaction on a place using general spending card  i see what amaze reflects it as.if suitable for a higher reward card  then the next time i go back to that place  i will use the higher reward card instead of the general spending card.,btohqsg
I just signed up using Chris‚Äô Kris+ promo code. Does the rewards  require a day or two to be reflected in my account? What is the best way to top up Kris+ wallet to get the sure-win benefits?,btohqsg
May I ask  if overseas spending  amaze will be the better choice? I previously used youtrip.,btohqsg
Hi friends  I have recently downloaded the Kris+ app trying to link to my google pay but can't seem to do so. Anyone else facing the same issue?,btohqsg
Just curious  is your phone a Samsung and you use Samsung Pay?,btohqsg
My phone is a Samsung  but i mainly do my transactions with google pay,btohqsg
oh then.. you can ignore.. it will be removed after few days from your Krisflyer page...,btohqsg
Only if you pair Amaze with the right Mastercard. The idea is while Amaze has a much higher FX spread than YouTrip and Trust  your paired Mastercard must have higher reward % to offset the FX spread. You should watch Chris's video on amaze vs Trust to get the idea,btohqsg
Can someone here guide me how do I top up $5 to Kris+? I am referring to the sure-win promo Chris mention here.,btohqsg
For my cruise spends that's charged to my Amaze wallet  all is under the travel category! Safe to say it's not advisable to use CRMC + Amaze on cruises!,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing =) Thankfully  you use Amaze Wallet.,btohqsg
Glad that there's the 4% cashback for this period too! A straight up easy decision :),btohqsg
You guys received netflix email for account sharing? If yes? Wanna check if its already enforce?,btohqsg

Will reflect after first spend on Kris+ i think. For the sure-win draw  you have to click on kris+ miles then transfer from your bank portal. Not recommended to top-up large amounts  just a small amount of expiring points from bank portal will do,btohqsg
How does the HSBC Travelone points system work? The points will come in after end of statement month? cause i spent some amount but still no points in unlike Revolution,btohqsg
First 50 for every monthSign up after the 1st May. The first person managed to hit the spending amount of $500 or $1000. So best is to sign up and immediately make a big purchase. If you fullfill the qualifying spending on the 10 May you have to hope that you are still within the first 50,btohqsg
Some others have mentioned this whole uob thingy is very sketchy,btohqsg
Same like any other sign up reward where it‚Äôs limited to the first 10/50/200 or so on. Very easy for the reward giver to claim awards all claimed,btohqsg
Yea‚Ä¶ i usually avoid getting too hyped up on UOB promos like such,btohqsg
They claimed that i wasnt part of the first xxx even though i did all the requirements within 3 days,btohqsg
Chris  is the net positive gain better than Amaze+UOB Lady (6 mpd)?,btohqsg
depends on how u value miles,btohqsg
Within 3 days still cannot. Haiz.,btohqsg
Will you earn 6mpd for uob lady and 4mpd for citi rewards if you withdraw cash in Japan?,btohqsg
of cos not  withdraw from Amaze wallet,btohqsg
CRMC doesn't give 10x points on mobile wallet transactions. Does it mean I should not add it to Google Pay? Is this why CMRC is not good to use with Kris+?However  Amaze + CRMC is a legit combo  do does this mean Amaze is not viewed as a mobile wallet?,btohqsg
Anyway guys  my dbs card kena fraud transaction again  a good remind to track your card transaction,btohqsg

This is the 3rd fraud on card for dbs this month,btohqsg

Your HP or bank account kena hacked? Have you changed your DBS account password?Are you using Android phone?,btohqsg
Do go see forum  the last round alot of dbs card user kena the igbchat subscription fraud. I just put coz usually this is major hack that dont affect just me. Change acct password wont help. I dont event have detail of the new issues card so definitely not my side problem.,btohqsg
If info breach is usually on company side not individual user side. Rmb how lazada kena hack before. Anyway just to clarify  the card info involved in those fraud transaction is not save on any website.,btohqsg
I have been using Altitude for many years  so far no problem.,btohqsg
I post for awareness only like i say  not saying everyone will kena it. There is thing call random generator that hacker use  it can be anyone who fall victim to it if not careful to track transaction.,btohqsg
this kind i believe she could be using android with malware installed..,btohqsg
Bidencash (yes real name) recently leaked the information for 2.1 milllion Visa cards. They are a platform for illegally acquired credit card numbers. Literally anybody could look up those leaked numbers and then use it to purchase anything.The fraudsters are creating fake ‚Äúchatgpt subscriptions‚Äù that have nothing to do with the OpenAI company. They‚Äôre just tricking banks into handing over the cash and then probably money laundering it through some shell companies.That‚Äôs why you need to always check your Credit card statements  even if you never used your card. Someone could have stolen the number and then charged random things to your account.,btohqsg
There are other possibilities. Mindful of the name/intent of the channel  would not elaborate  haha.Agree - let's be vigilant. I suggest lower our transaction threshold to be alerted. While we cannot prevent fraudulent transactions (just like we cannot prevent computer virus)  we can detect and respond when fraudulent transactions occur.,btohqsg

Is merchant name = MCC code?,btohqsg
Merchant name means the clinic or hospital name.,btohqsg
I see  thanks! Let me ask,btohqsg
H Gurus  do you know if EGA accepts forex deposit or only SGD?,btohqsg

assuming for overseas 1) Using Amaze+citi rewards gets 4mpd+1% instapoints-2.5%markup = 4mpd-1.5% vs2) using Amaze wallet gets 4% instapoints-0.7% markup = 3.3%If miles is valued >1.2 cents  Amaze+citi rewards better  if not option 2 better.,btohqsg
Which option would you personally pick? And generally what is the valuation of a mile for it to be worth it to fly?,btohqsg
Also depends if u have other use for Amaze+CRMC $1k cap,btohqsg
No more actually  only travel. Back home I use HSBC revolution. Hence  not sure which option is better. Haha,btohqsg
And travel expenses is less than 1k.,btohqsg

Hola I am new to the world of credit cards and seeking a recommendation for my first card. I prefer a card with no annual fees and no minimum spend requirement to start. Here are my regular expenses:1. Netflix: Currently using my debit card.2. Lunch and Dinner: Paying with DBS PayLah or PayNow at food courts and hawker centers.3. Travel: Using my Visa debit card for tickets. Frequency: 3 to 4 times a year. Fare is approx S$800-900 per trip.4. Zara Shopping: Buying clothes at Orchard with my debit card or occasionally PayNow.5. Apple Gadgets: Purchasing them every 2 to 3 months.6. Bars: Paying at bars with my debit card weekly.7. Groceries: Shopping at Giant or FP using PayNow  PayLah  or debit card.8. I need to pay my Tax as well9. Room rent: my house rental is S$950 and I use PayNow for that10. Gym fees : PayNowI also plan to buy the iPhone 14 next week. Could you please recommend the best credit card for me? Additionally  I would appreciate any cashback offers for initial expenses within the first month of having the card.Thank you for your assistance. I look forward to your reply.,btohqsg
I see. Thanks. So $1500 cap per month. So if I buy a laptop worth $1500 from Shopee using UOB ONE card  I can stop using this card for the rest of statement month,btohqsg

Yes. They are the same thing.,btohqsg

i signed up for HSBC revolution via Singsave at end apr.. During the sign up process  i wasnt presented the option to select the welcome gift (either luggage or $150)...Called up the CSO immediately after applying and found out that the $150 was automatically assigned to me.

Kept separate on the back end  but can be pooled together for the purpose of redemption. Earliest expiring points are redeemed first (e.g. WWMC) followed by non-expiring points (e.g. Altitude). If you cancel  all unredeemed points accrued to that card are lost.,btohqsg

Did someone recommend to use Amaze CRMC combo on Kris+? This needs Amaze to be added into Google Pay. But I remember watching a video saying CRMC does not aware points for Mobile Wallet which I confirm from T&C. So this way of using Kris+ won't work.Is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
Ermmm not sure. Many years ago get.,btohqsg
iirc only the CIMB VI got free DragonPass,btohqsg
Does giro payment treated as online payment for credit card?,btohqsg
So can simply add CRMC into Google Pay is enough. No need to go through Amaze when using Kris+,btohqsg
you need amaze because CRMC excludes Google Pay payment methods,btohqsg
i was told by hsbc banking hotline that after the 4 months of high interest  can just apply via sms again on the 5th month  then will get high interest again for another 4 months. Was told that there is no need to transfer out on the 5th month and then apply for ega high interest again on the 6th month. Anyone can confirm based on their experience?,btohqsg
Won‚Äôt work. Because the new reference month is your 4th month balance which is still high.,btohqsg
The officer is not wrong actually. U will indeed get high interest again for the next 4 months. Just that it‚Äôs on incremental balances! Half truth!,btohqsg
the purpose of transferring out is to reset the reference month back to a low amount.,btohqsg
Would like to check if I use uob preferred platinum visa to pay wedding hotel on contactless i will earn 4 miles right  if I pay through online payment link to the hotel I will not earn 4 mils right?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm on ocbc 360 account and using ocbc TR card  if I pair TR to amaze for overseas  will the usage of Amaze count towards minimum spend of $500 for 0.6% interest?,btohqsg
Yes also means  both ways will earn the miles ?,btohqsg
Sorry  what I mean is  you are correct: online won't earn miles  as it's not on the whitelist. Contactless will earn miles as long as the MCC is not on the blacklist.,btohqsg
Hi experts  does anybody know is SimplyGo transactions (Bus/MRT) are included in AMEX Krisflyer Ascend credit card to qualify for 1.2miles/dollar? TIA! üôèüèª,btohqsg

If you have nothing better to contribute  suggest you dun reply. My CBS credit rating is AA. Risk of default is close to 0%.,btohqsg
Exactly. Had applied for other cards at ard the same time. All gave in excess of 3 to 6 months limit.,btohqsg
Can share more on this if you can? I‚Äôm ok to cancel some of my cards if necessary. How would CIMB know how much limit other banks grant me?,btohqsg
Well  your limits are written in the CBS report. They can see how much limit you have with each bank and how much of it you are utilizing,btohqsg
Hi guys  for uob evol  if you use the physical card  does it count towards the 0.3% others category?,btohqsg
Question is why you choose physical card over mobile contactless? Give up 8% and choose 0.3%? Perhaps there is a way for you to use mobile contactless?,btohqsg
Isnt it capped at 20 for mobile?,btohqsg
Yes. So overall average out is 6.67%.,btohqsg

Some SG telco got free roaming to Malaysia if you are on that data plan.,btohqsg
for eligible spending yes (eg paywave at ntuc). but not recommended unless you have maxed out the cap for contactless and online and have no other alternative cards to use,btohqsg
NTUC FairPrice also can use mobile contactless  correct? Usually I only use Evol via Apple Pay (iWatch or mobile phone contactless) regardless I max out or not. Easy to pay. Just keep the physical card at home.,btohqsg
Any recommendation which CC to use for overseas car rental ? Preferable master so I can pair with Amaze.,btohqsg
If you have spend $300 on contactless and $300 on online  any more than that wont count to the cashback ma. In that case you can consider to tap the card physically for the 0.3% cashback category.Will I do it? No  i will just forgo the 0.3% and use mobile contactless like you haha. But ppl want to know whether can or not and the answer is yes and they can decide for themselves what is the best strategy.,btohqsg
Hello everyone  want to gather your opinion on travelling cards  do you use krisflyer or the  destination 's local card. E.g going to new zealand has its own star alliance.,btohqsg
Krisflyer is the loyalty rewards programme. Credit card is depending on where you can apply for (mostly Singapore)  need to be clearer on the question on what you want,btohqsg
One good website to explore where to credit your miles based on your fare  airlines and class ishttps://www.wheretocredit.com/,btohqsg
My aim is to access their airport  lounge,btohqsg
But won't it worth it to use the local destination's member cards for miles as your spending on car rental also counted towards points accumulation,btohqsg
"Why spend on the 0.3% category after fulfilling the 600? Shouldn't it be after spending 250 on mobile contactless and online  can just spend 100 on ""normal contact less"" then t he overall cashback will be higher than 6.67%?",btohqsg
Hey folks  I understand DBS WWMC and HSBC Revolution both awards bonus points for online transactions. Can I check whether Simba (TPG)  Senoko Energy and M1 recurring transactions qualify as online transactions for bonus points for both the above two cards? Thanks!,btohqsg
hsbc revolution dun reward bonus points for any of these  MCCs not in whitelist.Recurring is not online and utilities (Senoko) is excluded MCC so no bonus points for dbs wwmc either.,btohqsg
Agree. But what if the person already spend > $300 on each? And he/she dont like holding multiple credit cards?Thats why i say‚Ä¶I‚Äôm only answering to the original question yes or no with abit prerequisite for the scenario to make some sense. Not that I‚Äôm in full support to use it that way.We dk the person‚Äôs full story to keep making judgement on how they shd spend on the credit card. No need to keep piling on questions on why they want to spend it that way.,btohqsg
Any idea why refund the deducted back? Dbs dont have livechat for personal banking so cant contact them.,btohqsg
i would say its more likely agoda did the refund?,btohqsg
Yes cancel a hotel and got 100% refund but then deducted again.,btohqsg
I think you mistaken me with another user MouseHunter. I have no objection why the original poster wants to spend this way. In fact  I am pro the way he wants to spend like this. This is a clever way to increase the cashback percentage to be above 6.67%. I am just saying  in your example  you mention can spend on 0.3% category after the 600 spending. I am just merely saying  (in the interest of maximize the cashback %)  can just spend250 on mobile contactless 250 on online 100 on 'normal contactless' spend,btohqsg
Is my understanding below correct if I spend $300 on online and $300 on mobile contactless on Evol card to qualify for $40.30 Cashback.1).$250 online => $20 Cashback2). $250 mobile contactless => $20 Cashback.3). $50 online + $50 mobile contactless => $100x0.3% = $0.30 Cashback.,btohqsg
No. In this case you only get $40 cashback.,btohqsg
"Online and mobile contactless spend will be capped at $20 each. The additional $50 online and $50 contactless won't earn the 0.3% cashback  since they are ""capped"".",btohqsg
0.3% is considered as other spending so there will still be cashback,btohqsg
Is there any daily limit for amaze instarem cashback? Need to pay for hospital bill via health hub üòÅ,btohqsg
0.3% is 'for' other spending that is outside mobile contactless and online. Please check the UOB EVOL TnC.And I can tell you I only received $40 cashback so far  coz I only spent on online and mobile contactless.,btohqsg
Hi  for those having UOB one account and using 3 GIRO debit transactions instead SAL credit. Does IRAS ITX & PTX GIRO monthly payment counted as 2 or 1 transactions as it is from same organization? Thks,btohqsg
In regards to mobile contactless  does google pay considered as I read in singsaver notes that to enjoy 8% cashback on all online and mobile contactless spend (Apple Pay  Samsung Pay  Fitbit Pay)... Google pay not being mentioned,btohqsg
Per transaction up to 125  minimum 10. They only issue max 500 insta point per transaction.,btohqsg
Yes  need many 125 transactions üòÇ,btohqsg
What u can do is redeem the insta while u paying in block to maximize the cashback,btohqsg
What about CRMC? Or need to pair with Amaze for these merchants to make it work? By itself it won't earn 10x points? Thanks,btohqsg
Why you want to read other web site instead of UOB web site itself?,btohqsg
Amaze+CRMC should be ok for recurrent telco but utilities excluded,btohqsg
Hi  I'm a fresh grad  currently thinking of applying for credit cards  saw that UOB One account has pretty good PA interest rate. But was wondering  in terms of School Loan repayment  which card would you guys recommend? Am fine with any rebates (incl. miles) so long as its good rate. Thank you!,btohqsg
Thanks  your advices have been helpful. For utilities  my plan is to use UOB ONE for Singapore Power  provided the card eventually arrives üòîAs for electricity which I use Geneco  I think I'll use HSBC Advance. Not sure if there's a better alternative with miles card. I'm shifting from Cashback strategy to miles strategy.,btohqsg
Just happened to read it while checking out the promo in singsaver. Thanks,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt use citi smrt for 5% instead?,btohqsg
I have a few months till i'm new to citi again. No UOB evol as well ... so this already gives me the highest cashback ,btohqsg
I usually try to hit either contactless or online $250  with minimum $600 in total  recently only get rebate of $39.93  I never use card  not sure how is the calculation of 39.93  but also don‚Äôt check with Uob as the missing only 7 cents  but any idea why?,btohqsg
Perhaps $250 on online n $249.15 on mobile contactless.The rest of $100.85 or more are qualified but no Cashback transactions.,btohqsg
maybe used at uob$ merchant that are counted under others for 0.3%,btohqsg

Hi all  can I ask if UOB One card‚Äôs additional cashback (5-6.67%) for certain partners (dairy farm  shopee  simolygo) only applies after you hit a $500 min? Or it is all counted into the $500min but rewarded higher than normal purchases.Apologies if my question is a little unclear.,btohqsg
Is UOB lady 6 mpd for max 1k or 3k?,btohqsg

Cashback+  and since you brought it up  the AMEX one as well,btohqsg
AMEX true cashback worth it? I dont spend that much ie. below 500 on most months,btohqsg
What type of spending is it? If it is usual expenses like dining and groceries  I recommend HSBC Revolution for 2.5% instead of TCB 1.5%,btohqsg
I only want to focus on utilities  sp services  occasionally cabs/grabs. More to those fixed payments per mth,btohqsg
what about ur bus/mrt/groceries/telco etc? If can consistently clock $500 every month can use uob one card instead.,btohqsg
Was thinking of uob one too. But i see my transact history of telc bills   transport  utilities didnt rack up to 500.,btohqsg
HSBC no min spend too right.,btohqsg
Hsbc revolution no min spend and no annual fees,btohqsg
no min spend but no 10x points (4mpd or 2.5%) for utilities  telco  public transport,btohqsg
Hsbc rev seems alot better for me. I missed out on this. Thanks shifus!,btohqsg
Citi rewards will give 10x rewards on telco bills?,btohqsg
Question. Is Apple Pay or google pay considered online transactions?,btohqsg

Are we able to tell from the transaction how much has been spend on each category or have to ownself do manual tracking?,btohqsg

HSBC revo  hsbc advance  Citi rewards  ocbc tr  Citi cash back,btohqsg
Citirewards dont allow 4 mpd for travel mcc  hsbc revo reward the whitelist mcc up first 1k 4mpd. Ocbc tr dont reward extra for travel i think only based rate  ciit cashback only for dinning and grocery and petrol unless u mean citi cashback plus which give 1.6 percent flat. Hsbc advance give up to 3.5 percent (based rate is 2.5 if u spend 2k) and above and have ega,btohqsg
Hi  I‚Äôm changing from ocbc bank - uob one. And I‚Äôm thinking of getting uob evol.For uob evol card  if I link the card to FairPrice  ShopBack  etc  it‚Äôs considered online spend too like shoppe etc?,btohqsg
My mother is using uob one debit card to fulfill the $500 spending.U can try it and see uob one ACC tracker got indicate your spending.,btohqsg
shopback is online. Fairprice app having issue so may not be online.,btohqsg
no another deduction and may incur giro failure fee  need to pay cc manually.,btohqsg
Do u know if u can use multiple cards to achieve the spending requirement? For example $100 I use the uob one debit card and the other $400 I use uob evol card,btohqsg
Not sure. Pls CX with bank.I am planning to use uob one card and uob one supplyment card with my wife so spending together will sure hit $500,btohqsg
Yes as long as it is under list of eligible card,btohqsg
Why do that? Just use all EVOL for more rebate by spend $600,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows how will the interest for OCBC 360 be calculated? E.g If I just recently open an account and deposit $ in today  will i get the full 3%+ interest for the month (Let‚Äôs say i hit salary credit  save  spend category) ?,btohqsg
So let‚Äôs say i place a larger sum  will be able to average out to at least $500 through the month.,btohqsg
Yeah. If let‚Äôs say i place $20k today for example.,btohqsg
Hey guysFor hospital bill (SGH) which card is best to use? Ct scan.I got :Uob platinum visaUob signature visaCiti rewards + amazeHSBC revolution?,btohqsg
Will i still be entitled to the full month‚Äôs interest? Which is (3%+ * $20k) / 12,btohqsg
It will still be average out for the month ah (1 of 31 day)  no matter what  that why i say count daily  credit monthly,btohqsg
Just Curios- Can CPF payout prata? Early May23 was notified that i can draw up to $1124 for payout  or extend drawout to 70  failing to set instuction will automatically extend to drawout at 70. As the number 1124( like cursing me everyday die easily) so i changed to $1118 to reflect a change. Mid May23  CPF transferred $1118 as per instruction to designated account. Today received a mail stating that the payout is $1109. Can CPF suka suka change payment instruction ?,btohqsg
Citireward plus amaze via healthhub (up to 1k bill) can spilt bill according to other,btohqsg

Anyone tries receive money from China,btohqsg
Please be clearer in questions  money from bank  alipay  or what?,btohqsg
How do you add your bank card to wechat if you are not  China user ?,btohqsg
If paying with city + amaze . Does this mean I have to key it the amaze card number ?,btohqsg
actually which bonus interest categories u fulfilled? Likely only save cat for 1.2%?,btohqsg
Cant for wechat  but sgporean can open alipay to receive rmb,btohqsg
actually if using healthhub can use citi rewards card directly,btohqsg
Confirm yeah? I rather use wwmc,btohqsg
According to mileslion dbs wwmc not there for miles csdd for hospital bill  better to call dbs to double check if it was me. Dbs can be quite strict on rewards awards according to my experience.,btohqsg
healthhub is mcc 8099 not mcc 8062,btohqsg
Have u use dbs before on healthhub?,btohqsg
Then if test then go ahead.,btohqsg
However  do rmb now got amaze 4 percent cashback on amaze wallet spend  think that is a better offset if not miles chaser  cold hard cash rebate,btohqsg
but need to pay multiple $125 on healthhub.For cashback can use citi smrt  uob evo  dbs lf etc via healthhub,btohqsg
Hi if i deposit a 10k cheque before 3pm to ocbc bank do i get interest over the long weekend or no interest from issuing bank and ocbc?,btohqsg
If the healthub bill is more then 500 can do mulitple time  do 4 time get 20 off set it immediately then next bill so why not,btohqsg
Cheque need to be clear by bank lah,btohqsg
Reflect in acct then will earn interest,btohqsg
Ledger balance but not available will not earn right,btohqsg
Cause I‚Äôm going to kl tmr  then intending to use the debit card with amaze to clock in the required spending also.,btohqsg
Need convert SGD. Also need wait 2 working day after selling and converting,btohqsg
Uob debit is mastercard? Mine is visa,btohqsg
hihi anyone knows if hsbc revo bonus points monthly cap is based on date of posting or transaction?,btohqsg
Hihi sorry another noob question on amaze. If I pair it with my standard chartered unlimited credit card is it worst off then pair it with Citibank credit card?,btohqsg
1.5% rebate only  citi rewards or citi cashback card better,btohqsg
actually using uob evol or uob one card may be better even if incur 3.25% fx fee  given Amaze markup the exchange rate,btohqsg
I‚Äôll be scared to pair amaze with debit  so just be cautious,btohqsg
Agree since you already have uob EVOL  the 6.77% is > 3.25% fee,btohqsg
I see  thanks all for ur inputs. Will use the evol card for expenses there then üòä,btohqsg
Better don‚Äôt call bank. Later kena nerf.,btohqsg
Oh dbs wwcc gives 4mpd for health hub? Just saw the link. Is it really that way?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have DBS wwcc. Other can comment.,btohqsg
please don't call the bank... it works for sure,btohqsg
Cso won't know. U call them. They update the management. Then next mth u see it being nerf.,btohqsg

For osome  are there any recurring annual fees for incorporation and corporate secretary? Also is there a renewal fee for pte ltd?,btohqsg
PTE LTD no need renewal  but need to file annual returns yearly after each financial year end,btohqsg
Thank you. Any recurring fees involved post-incorporation?My understanding is it costs around 600+ for incorporation and corporate secretary.  Is corporate secretary a recurring cost or one-time?,btohqsg
SC unlimited advantage is their Cashback will be credited to ur next statement  even if it's <$1,btohqsg
Incorporation is one time.Corp Sep is annual recurring,btohqsg
hi! just started working full time for 4 months  mostly spend on food  physical shopping  gym membership and part time uni school fees. have an existing one account  so was thinking of doing a UOB One + HSBC Revo + UOB Absolute cashback ( for school fees). Would this be a good strategy for someone who just started working?,btohqsg
Thank for clarifying! with the affiliate code you provided  do you know how much is the cost for incorporation and basic corporate secretary (1 year). They don't provide the details on the landing page and wanted to get a sense before getting in contact with them haha,btohqsg
For statutory fees  no recurring fees involved post incorporation except for annual returns for PTE LTD  but has secretary / CSP fees. Incorporation fees $315 but secretary fees depends on each secretary / CSP,btohqsg
Should be $315 (Charged by ACRA) + $252 (Essential secretary 1 year),btohqsg
Ah okay  so the incorporation is exactly 'free' like they put on their website? Haha,btohqsg

Hi I have a question regarding UOB giroRecently I applied via UOB internet banking for my UOB EVOL and UOB ONE card and it was approved.Today is the due date for my payment. Will they auto deduct the amount used for me or how does it work?,btohqsg
it may not be so fast. i monitored my account which had giro arrangement approved 10 days ago but on due date nothing changed  so i transferred money in just in case. the notification of arrangement said it would take up to 30 days to take effect,btohqsg
If your evol and one card statement does not mention giro. Then it‚Äôs not in effect yet.,btohqsg
Hi all  I have recent made a webull account and tried to deposit money via edda from my DBS account and it went to a eGIRO application on 19 May and there was still no notification?,btohqsg
Mine approve within 10 min  u want to try again? Egiro suppose to be very fast,btohqsg
Is the HSBC EGA 1% p.a. Bonus Intereston your incremental SGD average daily balances applies only to the new fund for the first month or the entire period?,btohqsg
I don't know I have applied it a lot of times and it still asks me to apply for eGIRO whenever I want to use eDDa for deposit,btohqsg
e.g. If fulfilled everyday+ rewards requirements for Jun (FAST in $2k to EGA and 5 transactions in May or Jun) then get 1% bonus interest for incremental average daily balance in Jun wrt May.If fulfilled everyday+ rewards requirements for Jul (FAST in $2k to EGA and 5 transactions in Jun or Jul) then get 1% bonus interest for incremental average daily balance in Jul wrt Jun.and so on...This is on top of the 4.√ó% bonus interest promo with fixed reference month (the month before sms registration).,btohqsg
Thanks  incremental balance means new fund for that particular month?,btohqsg
For sharing  I got charged this amount in my card.Fraud transaction,btohqsg
that month average daily balance compared to previous month average daily balance,btohqsg
Meaning  not the entire amount will get the additional 1% bonus interest right?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know when the EGA 4.x% bonus interest will be credited. If I sign up in May  will I get the bonus in June?,btohqsg
if u are May-Aug cycle  you will receive most EGA bonus interest around end of Oct,btohqsg
Thanks. In this case UOB ONE is a better option for $100k,btohqsg
depends on which month you sign up,btohqsg
Today is my last month for EGA since I signed up in Mar. Do you all think it's a good idea to transfer my full sum of money from OCBC over to HSBC for one month to reset my OCBC balance back to 100K the next month (Jul)? right now ocbc already exceeds 100K but I'm still increasing the balance by 500 monthly  so looking for a good opportunity to reset back to 100K. If I compute correctly  I should be getting 5.7% for my HSBC in June so no opportunity cost for emptying the OCBC for one month. Any other considerations I missed out?,btohqsg
actually why u using ocbc as your main savings account? Is the interest higher than ega?,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone know how ssb interest is paid out? Is it to paynow number?,btohqsg
Is 1.8cpm considered decent for citi payall for insurance payment ?,btohqsg
maybe can go for the 2.2mpd promo effective 1cpm,btohqsg
I max out UOB (100k) and OCBC (100k + 500 increase monthly) and + GXS (5k) and balance in HSBC EGA. not very comfortable with EGA as a bit worried do something wrong and lose 3 months of interest so giving it lower priority.,btohqsg
Thanks may I ask which card promo is this for ?,btohqsg
citi payall promo  applicable for all citibank miles/points card  need to meet $8k for citi payall transactions till 20 Aug though,btohqsg
why not UOB 100k the rest into hsbc ega since max for that is 2mil and you can get 4.35% +1% for 4 mths. The rest can put into tbill,btohqsg
yes that's the plan to do for June only. For GXS since 5k maybe just keep it there.,btohqsg
I didn't transfer all earlier as was a bit scared I do any wrong step and don't get all 3 months of interest in HSBC. since June will be just one last month  I'm ok to take the gamble and actually quite confident I did the right steps to fulfill. just wondering anything else I need to consider.,btohqsg
no need to gamble can chat with hsbc staff on the app to confirm,btohqsg
nevermind bah lazy to call and quite confident actually. I like UOB and OCBC also because next month can see the interest immediately.,btohqsg
no need to call is in app chat,btohqsg
just ask did I fulfill all criteria?,btohqsg
good idea if use app I'm ok don't need to wait haha,btohqsg
ask if u are entitled to to promo rate and the bonus interest and confirm the mths that you are entitled,btohqsg
can just online chat and screenshot few days after u sms,btohqsg
ok I need to confirm and have to do it by today since it's the first day of the month.,btohqsg
Hi all  other than using payment services like citipayall  cardup etc.  what will be next best option to pay for insurance?,btohqsg
giro to HSBC for 1% cashback,btohqsg
or charge to UOB one card and use it to qualify for $500 spend bonus  then use HSBC giro to pay the UOB one card bills for 1% cashback,btohqsg
Don't forget to send your SMS to HSBC to activate EGA bonus interest for this cycle,btohqsg
Have the same question but for Great Eastern!!,btohqsg
