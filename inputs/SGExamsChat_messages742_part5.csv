Ppl are grieving and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúthis is some conspiracy by the CIA/biden administration!!‚Äù,btohqsg
I missed my bus today it must be the cia who is sabotaging me,btohqsg
Well  still the most popular network among the conservative voters,btohqsg
They also blame poor infrastructure bills,btohqsg
I thought Tucker Carlson leaving would have an effect but in the end nothing much happened,btohqsg
If u have some time to kill  can watch that segment from The Daily Show ‚Äî it‚Äôs hilarious,btohqsg
The Murdoch media is generally garbage,btohqsg
My Lord Duke you shall know the ways,btohqsg
Lord kuro would also know when our time has come,btohqsg
May he have mercy on us!,btohqsg
He is but one loud voice. There is no lack of conspiracy theoristsIt is very easy to cook up conspiracyFrom a group of people who suggested that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce and the Superbowl are all conspiracies too ‚Ä¶ I cannot üò≠,btohqsg
When Fox News had their exclusive with Mike Pence (trump‚Äôs VP during his administration) where he said that he does not want to endorse Trump  they quickly glossed over it cos they didn‚Äôt want to expose it to too many of their viewers. It feels like Fox isn‚Äôt an actual conservative network but like a trump mouthpiece at this point. Like by any standards of what a conservative is I think Pence is actually more conservative than trump,btohqsg
pence is the pre trump Republican conservative,btohqsg
Not just ‚Äúat this point‚Äù. They have a big role to play in him becoming the 45th previously,btohqsg
lol yeah even Taylor swift asking her supporters to vote somehow became controversial. She did not even endorse anyone but Fox hosts were like trying to frame it as some conspiracy and unhealthy for democracy like wtf,btohqsg
Fox News and cnn are Brainrot,btohqsg
Yes he aligns more with the Reagan type of Republican. Pre Reagan the republicans were actually quite moderate. Even Nixon who was known as a crook was rly not very conservative and he held some what you would call liberal views,btohqsg
Hmm I need to find out more about what they did last time,btohqsg
Well  a few years ago  TS openly declared she wanted to speak up against a Republican ‚Ä¶ it is recorded in the Miss Americana documentarySo  I can understand (but cannot agree) why they are so insecure about Taylor Swift,btohqsg
Yeah I heard she endorsed Biden in 2020 although she has yet to do so for this year (and it remains to be seen if she will),btohqsg
But trump aside  the American political system is in a terrible mess,btohqsg
The voting system just keeps perpetuating the 2 party duopoly. I wish Ross Perot won in 1992,btohqsg
It was a lot of mudslinging. Read up on Hillary Clinton + email + Benghazi if you haven‚Äôt,btohqsg
And also  majority of Americans don‚Äôt want to see a rematch between the 2. But independents like RFK jr will find it hard to break through because the 2 parties will keep saying that a vote for another candidate is a wasted vote  when they themselves refuse to change the system.,btohqsg
There is no way Rep doesn‚Äôt field Trump since they are capitalising on his MAGA baseI think Biden feels compelled to enter the ring since no Demo can beat Trump at this stageLet‚Äôs see how the court cases play out for Trump. The legal system has been unfairly kind to Trump thus far. He needed to pay a bond of 450+ million recently. Then he basically made noise and the appeals court reduced that amount to 170+ million,btohqsg
Actually Nixon was quite warmed up to the idea of abolishing the electoral college and establishing a 2 round voting system in 1968 after George c Wallace won some electoral college votes and was quite close to winning enough to deny Nixon of a victory in the EC (which means that the president will be selected by congress instead)  but a group of senators blocked it and now nothing has changed,btohqsg
Yeah. The thing is  given the 2 party duopoly  it‚Äôs very hard to break into the system via a 3rd party movement. Hence Trump didn‚Äôt join a 3rd party or create his own  and instead he just joined one of the 2 and tried to change the party from the inside out. So it‚Äôs also quite dangerous that one person can have that much leverage over one of the 2 parties in the duopoly considering that the duopoly doesn‚Äôt look like it would be ending anytime soon. Trump‚Äôs take over of the GOP is almost complete by this time  and the old guard republicans like Romney  Bush feel increasingly like they don‚Äôt belong in Trump‚Äôs maga GOP,btohqsg
For the 2nd para  rly? I thought there are other more popular options,btohqsg
Michelle Obama will probably poll better,btohqsg
For the last para  I believe he can still run anyway. The trials can be delayed. But idk if he has the power to pardon himself (I‚Äôll need to research more about this),btohqsg
But even without her I feel like they could get younger options,btohqsg
To pay for his legal fees,btohqsg
Bibles printed together with constitutions üòé religion and politics mix liao,btohqsg
I‚Äôm so glad Singapore is a secular state,btohqsg
Like FPTP is a munted voting system  but somehow America has something even worse with the electoral college,btohqsg
With my existing knowledge I hope I‚Äôm well equipped to do a polsci degree lol,btohqsg
One of the criminal cases is slated to start selecting jury mid April and the judge seems eager to push for trial to startTrump then talk about the judge‚Äôs daughter‚Äôs name and supposedly address/workplace in his social media platform Truth Socials (when he did that to others in the past  those others kenna harassed by his MAGA base)Now that judge just imposed gag order on TrumpDrama mama much. Everyday a new episode,btohqsg
Nikki Haley was definitely right about that one,btohqsg
lol talking about it I still rmbr all the memes this produced,btohqsg
This is one of my favourites,btohqsg
I kind of miss 2017 memes now lol,btohqsg
*cough cough9/11 happened when I was in JC,btohqsg

There‚Äôs one about Taylor swift leaving her phone in the WTC,btohqsg

Then family guy also gets some of them on the spot,btohqsg
Demo trying to dig where Trump is getting his money from for the previously 450+ mil (but reduced to < 200 mil) bond he had to payDemo now floating idea that Trump might be getting money from foreign entities and keep suggesting Russia and Saudi Arabia,btohqsg
Tbh I feel like Putin doesn‚Äôt actually prefer Biden over Trump,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt make sense  so ppl online were thinking he‚Äôs using reverse psychology by saying that,btohqsg
Got Saudi company do multi-billion business with Eric Trump before,btohqsg
