Like what do you feel is lacking in a 3rs,btohqsg
So if something is good  you would still go out and fk with it because you don't want it to be from factory?,btohqsg
That's not driver connection mate that's personalization,btohqsg
I don't believe it's perfect tbh,btohqsg
Having been in a .2 3rs,btohqsg
Everyone I've spoken to who owns or has extensively driven one,btohqsg
They say it's the best you get at that price point if you want something harsh,btohqsg
Even emotionally  what you're describing is personalisation,btohqsg
the r stands for really good.,btohqsg
Which is why I'd rather a Carrera T over a GTS or turbo/s,btohqsg
Or a GT3 over a 3rs,btohqsg
There's been one around for the 991.2 as well,btohqsg
tbf the modern 991/992s are abit plump but oh well,btohqsg
Not a lot of creature comforts,btohqsg
The 991.2 I feel is a sweet spot,btohqsg
I don't particularly like the .1s front,btohqsg
because i'm still deciding between the c or the p,btohqsg
funnily enough the 991 is already a decade old,btohqsg
yet seeing one is still a treat.,btohqsg
my heart lies with the 997s. would love to own one someday.,btohqsg
It's insane to think of it that way,btohqsg
the overall design still holds up,btohqsg
the 997 is getting slightly dated  but i am biased.,btohqsg
it isn't. it never will be.,btohqsg
Some 996s also not bad  I weirdly like the headlights,btohqsg
Sad that they are already peaking here,btohqsg
i think 964s are quite neat too,btohqsg
would love to see the rubystone carrera rs someday,btohqsg
wonder what the mileage is now,btohqsg
I think there's one around this week,btohqsg
I'm not sure if you know them,btohqsg
But the Lee Collection from Perth is here,btohqsg
And they've brought 2 trailers full of their cars,btohqsg
Mad man in Perth with some insane cars,btohqsg
Almost all the modern hypercars out there,btohqsg
the mad man part not the cars,btohqsg
that's a different level of rich,btohqsg
Yes and he's got chirons on oz plates,btohqsg
we don't talk about rich energy or ftx,btohqsg
But yeah they've got a cars and coffee around,btohqsg
Everything from golf gtis to a purple laf,btohqsg
asking for a friend do they shit on the jdms?,btohqsg
But you see less jdms here,btohqsg
Also people don't know how to drive,btohqsg
"yeah apparently there was a law that prevented overseas manufacturers from importing ""JDMs"" to AU",btohqsg
Barely seen a single person park without kerbing multiple wheels,btohqsg
have been watching aussie dash cam videos for years. they can't drive.,btohqsg
Even after having the hardest license course,btohqsg
true kopi license starts with them.,btohqsg
i can't tell if that's a 50 Jahre M3,btohqsg
