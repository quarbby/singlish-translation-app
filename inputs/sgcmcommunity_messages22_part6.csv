Yupp  just need to go spend time there  negotiate  ask freebies  higher over trade. Need to work on getting a good deal,btohqsg
okok i change it in a bit,btohqsg
Everyone is a nice guy nice husband until u bring their mother in,btohqsg
dont spread hate  spread le... xus love❤️❤️,btohqsg
No one can take that away from you.,btohqsg
that is good to hear. btw  is it ture Totota always provide just 1 year servicing?,btohqsg
because in the roadshow  they give additional 2 years sevicing  so 3 years in total  when I asked not 5 years? they were so proud saying toyota is always having 1 year,btohqsg
Most jap car ADs will throw in a free service or two. Usually most people cannot get to more than 2 services in a year at max unless doing phv or going cross country everyday,btohqsg
i thought AD is always having 5 years. Maybe I'm wrong,btohqsg
i not sure about toyota ah  but mazda right  standard is 3 years servicing. u can add another 2 years if you want but at a cost ah,btohqsg
idk how the math adds up but yeaa just sharing,btohqsg
Math aside  some also prefer AD service and general feel of their facilities. Like free coffee etc.,btohqsg
somemore if ad right  you can ensure that the job done is of top notch quality,btohqsg
Some didn’t even wait for Mother to come already leggo liao,btohqsg
previously looking at Avente  they are having 5 years  I think that is why i had that impression AD are all 5 years,btohqsg
Nopeeee  if they give you 5 years free  how to earn money hahah. 5 years of warranty is more common,btohqsg
BMW is 5 years warranty n service,btohqsg
you are right  that is the thing I mixed up,btohqsg
Food for thought  Mother: if ADs are so great  why are there so many external workshops surviving and surviving well at that.,btohqsg
Already paid for it when you bought the car,btohqsg
This one really depends on the AD  some are not good at all and will just throw parts in without fixing the issue,btohqsg
because is cheaperr ah  thats what i can think off,btohqsg
Warrently 4-8 years Depent on what lol,btohqsg
Ya for the plus package even battery is free only need change tyre,btohqsg
Merc 10 year warranty for engine and gearbox but they charge exorbitantly hign prices for the service and you need to go to the AD for the warranty to hold up,btohqsg
In the end you become a cash cow for them,btohqsg
That how they maintain the nice as show room hehe,btohqsg
That why many under warranty keep stock,btohqsg
And ppl like me looking at second hand car now,btohqsg
Depent on modelLa  uncle like me also stock my car lol,btohqsg
U ask those uncleDriving e class and s class mod,btohqsg
if they charge low. all their towkay customers won't have the rich feel,btohqsg
They ask u mod what lol,btohqsg
I seen some e / s class mod to become maybach lookalike.,btohqsg
is Apple CarPlay or Android Auto necessary? I saw Corolla Altis don't have this feature,btohqsg
Ya but not much such in sg lol  c and a class a lot of mods la haha,btohqsg
The older u get the more stock,btohqsg
Most uncle just drive stock and change new car,btohqsg
Stock his last Merc s class stock,btohqsg
All these are uncle car ma,btohqsg
My in law family all driving bmw,btohqsg
I got a uncle friend driving s400   he drive me car once and come back ask me   u Siao Lang is it   this car so bumpy and fast for what haha,btohqsg
this one boils down to u sirr  for instance  if uw to use spotify right  like the interface itself  then the carplay all will be usefull,btohqsg
If you like to use navigation on your phone yes  as it makes life easier. Otherwise no need  Bluetooth for calls and music is enough for me,btohqsg
even Mazad just has wired. I saw just Aente is all wireless,btohqsg
I would use wired even if wireless is available because need to charge phone mah. Use carplay or android auto will drain battery  wired will keep charging,btohqsg
Also for wired carplay  can buy dongle on Lazada for 10 to 15 dollars and turn into wireless,btohqsg
I change to jdm I will change my hu,btohqsg
The Mazda wired carplay not bad  the infotainment is quite slick actually,btohqsg
Yah  i like the heads-up display and 360 cam on M3,btohqsg
