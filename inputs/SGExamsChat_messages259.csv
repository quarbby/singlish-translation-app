u rush so fast not like the thing jst pop,btohqsg
the teachers / lectures have to read through also,btohqsg
I sayin tis cuz^ back at my time biomed sci got 1k students then go for appt test,btohqsg
then selected end up only got 5 students,btohqsg
i think biomed they don't accept as much as other course,btohqsg
yeah i'm q calm haha not rushing anything lol,btohqsg
@crying_over_social_studiesu look for mi for -?,btohqsg
No Neko not use to it,btohqsg
awh miss u too cuz I miss ss,btohqsg
EAE people around me I never hear anything,btohqsg
occasionally some years take in different numbers for some courses,btohqsg
Do yall ever feel lonely af as a jae student in a class of eae ppl,btohqsg
why would u feel that way tho,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the same as being a DSA / JAE student in a ip schooo,btohqsg
You will somehow still find friends :),btohqsg
I only can relate that in sch life,btohqsg
Easy way out for jae is to not go ip sch lol,btohqsg
And oh my goodness these ppl are miles ahead,btohqsg
Fact that they got better results,btohqsg
Is comsci hard? I aiming for that  but I already struggling with a level computing,btohqsg
I tell the caifan uncle I study computer,btohqsg
For me not rly -? I started codin since 12,btohqsg
My o lvl better than them,btohqsg
Then I not happy apply eae,btohqsg
I not smart enuf for ip,btohqsg
Technically the course is applied AI and Analytics,btohqsg
Honestly I feel like no matter where u go in sg education system  oso will be depressed so no diff,btohqsg
I just wanted to try out,btohqsg
But is it even ur passion?,btohqsg
Cuz ICT u nid to have passion,btohqsg
I don't have a passion in life that can be translated to a job,btohqsg
My interests all very diversified one,btohqsg
I got a lot of interests,btohqsg
But I don't mind data sci or coding tbh,btohqsg
I think of it more as a medium,btohqsg
U get a lot of freedom to go into any industry u want so its q fun,btohqsg
Yea I feel like u enter jae  u are the average of the average,btohqsg
But like as in DSA or even EAE,btohqsg
No I applied DSA ip school,btohqsg
Still rmb when my teacher tell me enter dsa might backfire,btohqsg
Because there is still a problem,btohqsg
But damn shag cos ntu data sci I think is 3.92 gpa,btohqsg
Like even in cca   the IP students know each other for 4 years   u think they will pick u out of their 4 years,btohqsg
u DSA u jus join wht makes u reliable,btohqsg
I mean either way rn I think I'm 4.0 for everything so it's fine,btohqsg
Yea but my teachers say the pt of jc is to get into uni. Syf and national games are almost useless if u dw to continue the thing as a job,btohqsg
I DSA not for my passion,btohqsg
Cat wanted to ask something and disappeared,btohqsg
Then cca might stress u out and then no time to study and u screw up,btohqsg
For that subjects I wanna taken,btohqsg
Honestly there isn't much difference between poly and jc,btohqsg
H2 geog + h2 lit in el,btohqsg
Yea both makes u want to cry,btohqsg
As long as u work hard end goal is uni,btohqsg
But ROI of a comp sci degree is worth it,btohqsg
Cos cs or ds need minimum masters,btohqsg
For poly to get into comsci  do u need like perfect GPA?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think many poly students target computer science,btohqsg
I'm gonna be doing data science,btohqsg
Nobody I‚Äôve encountered so far has been interested in that,btohqsg
Which would you have chosen if I gave you two options:1. Go into the course that you have  a passion for but you be damn slack in the course2. Go to a course that will give you a good GPA and bring you to the next education level,btohqsg
