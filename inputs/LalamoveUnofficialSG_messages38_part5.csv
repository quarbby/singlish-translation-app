I had a few private cash job multi stops  i always chase them before my last drop to complete the payment,btohqsg
If it is worth your time then do it lor provided its still there,btohqsg
It near by pick up is not userDrop off not user,btohqsg
Doesnt matter  u got no leverage now. U can try asking CS if u can take back the goods first,btohqsg
I wld tell the customer the parcel still with me and i am at drop off pt. If nvr receive the payment  i will not complete the delivery and it will cost them more later as i need to go make another trip back,btohqsg
I had a sim lim sq order drop CPU and monitor  reach there customer not at home. Item is too valuable to leave at door step customer willing for me to come back at a later hr and pay me extra for the added trip.,btohqsg
Sim lim sq shop paid for the order,btohqsg
If i take back the parent will piss,btohqsg
The problem is no one ans call,btohqsg
Any chance having their hp no can trace this person,btohqsg
More ppl like this die siaa,btohqsg
So who is the one who owes you? The cake shop?,btohqsg
Now i know how taxi driver feel,btohqsg
Usually if they doing business wont scam laBut still bad habit to delay payment,btohqsg
I mean i assume its some home business,btohqsg
I got one Indian restaurant also delay payment,btohqsg
Then they pay up after a few hours,btohqsg
That also happen to me somewhere novena late payment,btohqsg
Restaurants sometimes is they busy  but ya call cs can help remind  make them kan cheong,btohqsg
If the one that made the order is not sender or receiver then who is he?,btohqsg
If middle man that take private DO and sub con out gg,btohqsg
That the problem pick up and user never ans call,btohqsg
But the pick up paid to the user,btohqsg
This kind of ppl take other ppl's time and money for granted,btohqsg
Oh user is middleman?.... u have to be prepared to not get the money üò£,btohqsg
"Just for everyone's general knowledge  when such things happen  even if u make police report they will only keep the report as a record. You not getting paid is not considered a ""scam"". Legally  a scam involves loss of money. In such cases we lose time but we didnt payout/lose money  so its only considered a breach of terms. I tried making a report once  this is what officer explain to me",btohqsg
He never ans call but that was the last seen,btohqsg
Never get paid is ok i want this kind of serve with justice,btohqsg
Not near leh pick up and drop off location,btohqsg
This kind of pattern got intention to siam payment,btohqsg
If he have time to text he can also do a paynow,btohqsg
But so as per what the officer told me  to have justice served u would have to sue him in court üôÅ,btohqsg
Ya sibeh anticlimaxI was all geared up with my story with screenshots and witnesses,btohqsg
Aiyo no lar for a $20 jobI know this is why those scammers get scot free but really who got time/money to sue,btohqsg
I think this person do it many time,btohqsg
My case also  surely not first time,btohqsg
Then that y he will do more,btohqsg
I drive at nite a lot so i am careful with cash jobs  if sender says receiver is paying  i will call receiver to confirm.,btohqsg
Now dosent matter day or night,btohqsg
Yes subsequently thats what i do too,btohqsg
Kenna this type also damn sianz one,btohqsg
Call them.number is not on have to call via watsapp,btohqsg
It was llm agent's fault right,btohqsg
Cant be bah  someone has to key in this data,btohqsg
Missed a few good stacks for my next PU,btohqsg
Werent u saying it was llm agent? Or i misread cos got like 5 threads ongoing at same time ü§£,btohqsg
Fella said it was an error i cant be bothered to argue already,btohqsg
Just want llm to cancel and move on,btohqsg
Ya some ppl are unapologetic abt cancellingThey dunno once the time window missed it can mean no job for next hour,btohqsg
I think LLM shld impose a 50% surcharge on priority/urgent deliveries  then disable stacking or drivers with on going jobs,btohqsg
