What abt transparency? Like I will tell u I buy at 100k n sell u at only 110k.,btohqsg
go in with the mindset: everyone is out to scam me. i need to do my own homework  i need to do my own checks  i need to be cautious,btohqsg
talk is cheap. get it down in writing and acknowledged and signed.,btohqsg
Ya car COE going to end in 1 year. Finding 3 years left vehicles and wait for moreCOE quota to change new.,btohqsg
Also remember the car send for inspection can always cover this cover that then go inspection come back pass,btohqsg

What’s PPI? Sorry new to this term ?,btohqsg
"Hi I drive a Hyundai. It is a good car and brand to me because i find it very value for money. Compared to other brands  the ratio of car price to number of ""premium"" features is good.",btohqsg
https://www.hyundaiofnewbern.com/hyundai-vs-toyota/I went to see this article. Hah,btohqsg
thats a pro hyundai website tho  i drive a hyundai too and agree w trev,btohqsg
Yes that’s true. Hahaha. Toyota supporters come alive and debate. Hahhaa. Wana hear more,btohqsg
I actually drive a kona la. But wana know what are the thoughts of others.,btohqsg
i like that hyundai seems like a very basic brand  but the features in the cars are not always present in other brands. my favourite is ventilated seats (on bread and butter car Avante CN7)  sunroof  full safety systems. another big big point is the size of CN7 is bigger and sportier than lets say Altis  its competitor.,btohqsg
alot of legroom in that sense,btohqsg
Make me feel I didn’t make a wrong purchase,btohqsg
good choice nonetheless! driven SX2 and previous gen before. both also impressive. their technology is great,btohqsg
Comparing Hyundai vs Toyota is like comparing Samsung to Nokia,btohqsg
