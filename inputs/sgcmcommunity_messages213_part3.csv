Chinese got a saying 锦上添花 means means adding flowers to brocade. The flowers for China cars r Advanced tech like large screens  AI assistants  and driver aids. Luxurious interiors with ambient lighting n premium materials. Sleek design  eye-catching styling  n  smart gadgets.,btohqsg
"The issue with these cina cars is they pile on the ""flowers""—flashy features—without perfecting the ""brocade""—the fundamentals.",btohqsg
Brocade refer to Build Quality & Reliability  Engineering Excellence  Safety & Structural Integrity Driving Dynamics Efficiency & Powertrain Reliability,btohqsg
These fundamental area is where Cina cars have big issues,btohqsg
The Google review quite bad bro lol,btohqsg
For those driving cina cars  do yall experience this?,btohqsg
Rented a brand new GWM Wey 5 when overseas. Interior built quality is ok. But the tech really not that reliable. Unsure if it is due to the cold weather. But sometimes car is unable to start. The regen is also not that good. Mileage is much shorter than what was stated,btohqsg
Car dont seems to grab on the road when driving on highway. Seems like the weight distribution wasnt done well enough compared to contis. Onboard Nav  AA/CP wasnt working. Torque is good but acceleration was quite slow. 4.9m long but the interior is not very spacious (comparing to Model Y). Overall the impression it gave me was kinda bad.,btohqsg
When i go i feel they okay ah hahaha i got see the reviews also 😂😂,btohqsg
