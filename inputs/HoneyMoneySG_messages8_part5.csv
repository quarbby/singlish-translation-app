KarlThe mistake has been corrected. I will be removing previous messages as they are not relevant to the discussion.,btohqsg
JJ01I got your point too  but yes. Lets de-escalate and put it to rest,btohqsg
PSA: To be transparent  I have also moved my 99% of my USDC from Hodlnaut to FTX Blockfolio due to the current Crypto landscape. I am doing this as a de-risking move.This are no bad news of Hodlnaut (for now). In fact I think out of all lending platforms  they are still the most transparent and forthcoming one to respond to customer queries. I'm just being conservative for now.You can read JT's (Hodlnaut Co-founder) tweet here to clarify Hodlnaut operationshttps://twitter.com/jt_hodlnaut/status/1538574587813801984?s=20&t=kHhNL6lXsmddkWF7C2yA6w,btohqsg
Thanks Chris! Will dl instarem and tie it with Citi rewards card.,btohqsg
Btw any thoughts about buying VOO vs Amundi Prime USA fund (one of Endowus's newest fund offerings)?,btohqsg

Can't crash much more (already near historical low); dividends have been steady and substantial; and it's classified as a 'List A' ETF by CPF:,btohqsg
Can you guys transfer your usdc in ftx blockfolio to DBS MCA direct?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  does anyone have trouble logging into hodlnaut on their mobile app ? It seems like when I try to key in my email acc it does not proceed any further,btohqsg
Hello everyone  anyone know is all Apple/Netflix/Spotify/YouTube subscription consider as others category or online payment for credit card? I refer for UOB EVOL  DBS live fresh and OCBC frank card.,btohqsg
Hi guys never had a credit card before but was interested in credit card churning. Just watched honey money video about it. If anyone can share their experience or tips on it I would appreciate it,btohqsg
1. Apply for credit card with promo2. Spend minimum amt required to achieve promo3. Apply for another credit card with promo (and start from step 1 for the new card)4. Wait for the promo from the 1st card to be credited5. Check with bank if there is any minimum period to hold the card if not the promo will be clawed back.6. Once period is up  cancel card.7. Once the duration of 9-12 mnths is over (depends on the bank) from the date you cancelled your card  apply for a new card from that bank with promo8. Profit.,btohqsg
Apparently now a lot of card requires you to not cancel 12 months how do you go around that? And also can we apply multiple cards every month? Then just cancel after the 12 month,btohqsg
I think some people try to imitate him. Just beware,btohqsg
Most impt thing is to pay bills IN FULL and ON TIME. This shd easily maintain credit score at AA even if you have multiple lines of credit,btohqsg
I am just holding the cards for 12 mnths  and why would you want to apply multiple cards per mnth? Just use 1 card per mnth to make sure you hit the minimum  don't overspend,btohqsg
I'll let others comment on credit card churning. I got too much flak for talking about it online,btohqsg
"Yes  don't trust anyone that just says ""Hello"" to you and ask you to join crypto & investment scams",btohqsg
Yeah was thinking of using the one card and hitting the gift rewards and get another card from another bank and do the same in another month. Yes credit card churning for the rewards,btohqsg
Just go read the comments in my credit card churning video,btohqsg
Just read it mostly people are concern about their credit score. Anyway how do you guys buy groceries vouchers? Do they have an expiry date on it?,btohqsg
I am in my 2nd year of doing it alr  as Chris said in his video  this is all factored in the bank's customer acquisition costs. On your end  if you pay your bills in full on time and maintain a good credit score  banks will continue to issue you credit cards no problem.,btohqsg
So what’s the best one? Most people already have most bank’s  credit cards,btohqsg
Just received my samsonite with maybank cc,btohqsg
Cimb don’t seem to have anything that good,btohqsg
