true story. a friend of mine once bought a vios. Damned fool drove it 2+ years and 80 000km without changing the oil before the engine finally blew. Fucking tough as shit car. It cost him about 2k to repair. i joked that doing it his way actually saved him more money than regular service + oil change,btohqsg
