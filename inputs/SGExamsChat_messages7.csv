I can't even imagine meeting someone top in NOI  yet alone IOI gold,btohqsg
I didnt study for psle at all,btohqsg
I got participation for Chem Olympiad,btohqsg
I got 238 but my parents expected 240-250+ so let's just say I disappointed them real time,btohqsg
they tot I was a 245+ Calibre student lol,btohqsg
not in the eyes of my parents,btohqsg
Same I disappointed my parents lol,btohqsg
Most of my friends went victoria ip chung cheng high raffles girls,btohqsg
ooo I'm in Chung Cheng yishun,btohqsg
How come all the gold medallists for Chem olympiad from ri ah?,btohqsg
I was wrestling and sleeping in class hahhahahah,btohqsg
^ I got mere 207  am in noose now. PSLE doesn’t define you.,btohqsg
Lol I rmb thr was this math olympiad ri hosted,btohqsg
"ya my pri sch class was ""top class"" majority got 240+",btohqsg
And like hwa chong or National University of Singapore High School of Math and Sciences,btohqsg
RI and NUSH are a duopoly in math and science,btohqsg
Thats why elite schools have the edge,btohqsg
You work hard you get rewarded what,btohqsg
wasn't the best rgs or some shit,btohqsg
Ah lol my dad tried to transfer me to nush in sec 2 but i got rejected,btohqsg
ya but sometimes u get more resources than others,btohqsg
OMG WHEN I WAS A DUMB KID I USED TO WANT TO GO THR CAUSE I LOVED MATH,btohqsg
and these resources can help u do better,btohqsg
NUSHS existed during your Dad’s time? Wow your dad must be really young,btohqsg
Passion for mathematics is a great thing!,btohqsg
Elite schools are loaded and have resources,btohqsg
but screwed up the Y3 intake test,btohqsg
I wanted to go but I heard the food was bad,btohqsg
Back in p6 i jst wanted to get all c for psle lmao,btohqsg
and I didn't do well enough for psle anyway,btohqsg
My school canteen food is amazing,btohqsg
I mean transfer me not my dad.And no he is not young he was a teacher in acjc during thr 1980s,btohqsg
Passion for the humanities however should be encouraged in our society.,btohqsg
my sec sch was bad until we changed prijical and had new stalls,btohqsg
Cus i didnt care at all,btohqsg
The point is they have an edge and are better to study in,btohqsg
Sn girls school u cant xome lol,btohqsg
At least I think u r,btohqsg
My portfolio would be so much better if I went to an elite school,btohqsg
We have 16 stalls and it all tastes amazing😍😍,btohqsg
I have the drive  just not the grades,btohqsg
Well why didnt u do so then,btohqsg
CHAD SOUNDS LIKE A BOY NAME,btohqsg
Heh my dad expected me to do really well esp in chem and get a decent job and maybe take over his tuition business,btohqsg
my JC has great food tho,btohqsg
Also to save his face he told me my score is embarassingly lower than his students rank points,btohqsg
At least you can go to an Elite school after O’s,btohqsg
It’s ok you just have to try to find success along the way. Unfortunately the Singapore education system only cares about grades,btohqsg
Mfer u say u didnt do well for Os,btohqsg
Going to an elite school doesn't automatically give a better portfolio. It's possible to gain a good portfolio without being in a top school,btohqsg
Im so ext and hist sounds damn fun in ejc,btohqsg
woman I say I didn't do well for psle not Os,btohqsg
Like the chers dress as hitler,btohqsg
Yeah i messed up my Os as well didnt stjdy shit,btohqsg
if you have the drive  you'd be looking for opportunities yourself and not be waiting for school to bestow it upon you.,btohqsg
ya apparently my friends bought us and USSR flags for hist,btohqsg
say that to the MPs from RI,btohqsg
looks like I said wrongly sorry about that,btohqsg
HAHHAHAH yah dammn funny bro I wan go,btohqsg
was referring to going to nush and not doing well enough,btohqsg
True when there is a will there is a way,btohqsg
Don't forget that each cohort is more than 1200,btohqsg
At the end of the day  depends on what you do,btohqsg
If u go elite better chances,btohqsg
In that 1200 each year  how many are going to become our MPs?,btohqsg
For elite schools  they have tons morw,btohqsg
every school has via and servie learning opportunities,btohqsg
But of course depend on urself,btohqsg
if you try and failed there can only be 2 reasons,btohqsg
Not entirely true.A lot of schools don't even have access to olympiads,btohqsg
I’ve seen the ones at ACJC,btohqsg
I heard ri has a humanity programme,btohqsg
You can be in RI and just do A’s and you’ll be no different from any other JC student,btohqsg
I mean its gives u a good study profile but even if u r in a bad scg if ur alevel results are good then they will look at yr results not sch,btohqsg
Hey bedok how r u doing in sec 5 buddy,btohqsg
Practically opportunities no matter your interest,btohqsg
I should've jst take part jn math olympiad when given the chance to do so,btohqsg
Untrue  even YIJC has participation in Olympiads like chem olympiad,btohqsg
1. You didnt try hard enough or 2.Barking up the wrong tree. If you're sure you've tried hard enough  look for another tree that is more suitable for you to bark up.,btohqsg
Nice!Whr u panning to go to aft tht,btohqsg
Like other than.sch u can join via leadership character and cca so Ig its wat u prioritse,btohqsg
Then again w without winning anything in Olympiads  no point in going,btohqsg
I must have been seeing apparitions then,btohqsg
focus your time on something else,btohqsg
Ye I can’t find the  tree,btohqsg
DHS would most probs accept u haha,btohqsg
When i was j1 during the j2 study week chem lecture they put up slides asking us to apply for chem olympiad if we want to,btohqsg
Itll look good in ur profile an dlike I guessed like all ans once and like miracle I got in so like u nvr know,btohqsg
Correction  blunder on my part shouldve been JPJC,btohqsg
Yah I mean try but udk jus guess,btohqsg
Maybe thats for your cohort they did it in november 2018,btohqsg
I got so much hate for the math olympiad shit lol,btohqsg
Cause the smart people in my sch didnt think I deserve it,btohqsg
Cause I was the only one who got im and mot them,btohqsg
If thats true then i must have been hearing things,btohqsg
So during mo training they were like omg ur so fab,btohqsg
they could’ve signed up by themselves,btohqsg
anyone wrmember taking those UNSW tests in pri sch,btohqsg
Then they whispered to my frnds that fab meant fucking asshole bitch lol,btohqsg
btw for ntu can you still apply for schoaalrship after paying hte application fee?,btohqsg
Is it ok to wear tapered pants to sch,btohqsg

Oh lol mine is too small its so uncomfortable,btohqsg

I gather that you're in RA then,btohqsg
Isnt that a radio station or smth,btohqsg
the RA math test was okay,btohqsg
FMaths and AMaths are not very similar,btohqsg
Since you mentioned top noi medalist I thought it'd be a ra class,btohqsg
had a lot of calculus which i wasn’t really good at,btohqsg
But I thot u have to take another subj,btohqsg
I can neither confirm nor deny this,btohqsg
I find it dumb you can’t take RA math with FM combi,btohqsg
His username is the speed of light,btohqsg
I didn't expect anyone to notice,btohqsg
can I jus say im so screwed for eoys lol like I camt study alone,btohqsg

And like my old study frnd grp became so toxicc lol,btohqsg
have you completed any of the syllabus for your subjects,btohqsg

H2 Maths and H3 Maths are only a number apart,btohqsg

OMggg I wanted to be in it sia,btohqsg
Bit I want legit acting not poetry,btohqsg

My frnds are trying to get me to learn gz,btohqsg
Can I jus say I hate junior senior lines it pretty dunb,btohqsg
We have to be formal with juniors,btohqsg
And like if u see us outside u cant tell we from same cca,btohqsg
U will think we r strangers,btohqsg
Caise they have some stupid logic that being frnds with them will.make them.lose their respect for u,btohqsg
We can't even say hi outside lol,btohqsg
And my cher toldme.tosay mo when a junior ask me for help,btohqsg
That’s one of the best ways to gain respect,btohqsg
Cause he said im not their ic its not my busines,btohqsg
But kike if they ask my but not their ic it shows smth???,btohqsg
probably why he’s teaching in a secondary school,btohqsg

Against the advice of his military officers,btohqsg
anYway we have a stupid gurl in our sch who tried ti cheat in exams lil,btohqsg
And she hid her chem notes in sanitiary bin BHAHAH,btohqsg

Glad I don’t have to do Chem anymore,btohqsg
Is it the bounce bounce vibrate bang bang kaboom chapter? Haha,btohqsg
It’s in both the physics and chem syllabi,btohqsg
My physics teacher literally when like  y’all learnt this chapt in Chem  next chapt...,btohqsg
Like why did MOE even duplicate it,btohqsg
it’s not much of a chapter though,btohqsg
would’ve been even funnier if your chem teacher did the same,btohqsg
“y’all learnt this chap in physics”,btohqsg
Ok fine maybe I know so that no matter you take comb sci chem bio or phy bio you learn it  but then it became repetitive for phy chem,btohqsg
the only difference will be how you answer the question for physics and chem paper,btohqsg
I thought most secondary schools make Chem compulsory,btohqsg
Yes. I was surprised when my Friend told me he took bio phy,btohqsg
The normal mode of sar21 is semi auto,btohqsg

Not all ppl in the gp still at O Levels😂,btohqsg
We split the groups up so that O/N Levels people can be more comfortable in a group for their own,btohqsg
That isn’t flooded with A questions all the time cause A Level people are more active for some reason,btohqsg
more addicted to their phones :>,btohqsg
No  it's just that they have more questions,btohqsg
