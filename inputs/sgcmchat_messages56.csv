next yr january . got cars   motorbikes even pick up trucks from thailand have on this event .,btohqsg
All the way from Thailand eh? If they can tour all the way to SG ah,btohqsg
Wicked wallop is a decade old automotive event. Mostly for modified and old school vehicles. Typical everyday grocery getter would look out of place in the event ground.,btohqsg
This one got chicano style chopper also I think.,btohqsg
ah yeah the pick up trucks from thailand,btohqsg
Yes. That goes under modified bikes.,btohqsg
Solely for bikes there are chopper bobber brat rat cafe cruiser easy-rider custom etc etc,btohqsg
But locally  yea the scene is small. Very small. Less all the wannabes.,btohqsg
Really macam the lowrider of motorcycles,btohqsg
Conclusion - Due to the overwhelming response that I have received  people from my side are changing to Speedo's meet so I have decided as the founder and owner of Team Prestige to cross out my sponsorship with Sonax. So no more free gifts. And also to cancel my meet  so that it makes everyone happy. Even though it took me 2 months of sleepless nights and foodless days to go through the storm just to organize a meet for the community  I guess some people just want it so badly  I'll just take a step back. So do enjoy and please go to Speedo's meet. KLP ain't happening,btohqsg
Nie Ga 2is this the Msian Chiron?,btohqsg
For those who go Msia a lot  can go visit this Car Accessory shop. Cfm cheaper than Autobacs,btohqsg

Desperate times calls for desperate measures,btohqsg

Try moving it front and back then pull out  use a hand to push apart those small red things (brake pads),btohqsg
You need to pull out the pants,btohqsg

From between the disk and pads,btohqsg
Don't move the wheel too much,btohqsg

Use a stick or something thin to get in there and push if required,btohqsg
Actually  what does the HOST of a car meet do or get?Like  is there food trucks  food stall  brands stall and stuff? Or just people parking their car in a carpark like another shopping mall.,btohqsg
Stuck on the disk between the pads and disk,btohqsg
Depends on the type of meet,btohqsg
To food truck  merch  music  prizes  sponsor booths  etc.,btohqsg
Yes that's between the pads and disk,btohqsg
Try holding the red tabs apart,btohqsg
And keep the wheel in the air,btohqsg

Not on the ground when you spin it around,btohqsg

Try go to the the cycle rentals nearby,btohqsg
They can help you loosen the caliper and remove the pants,btohqsg
Sometimes have those Shimano tool posts,btohqsg
With the tools tied to a pillar,btohqsg
Hold the bike vertically and push,btohqsg
Since it comes down to this  wait for police to go bonding with u guys on the 17th December at Kallang,btohqsg
Is there gna be like lots / space allocation for each group etc? People at the entry point to direct traffic ?,btohqsg
"Like ""staff"" in the ""event"" itself.",btohqsg
You telll him who will side with Jem,btohqsg
They need approve by the person in charge at there,btohqsg
So they can host the place,btohqsg
No one will come to his meet,btohqsg
The person in charge meaning like shopping mall staff?,btohqsg
He also pm me about his meet cancel and then say some things ah at 2300hrs..,btohqsg
Approval for tons of cars to enter the carpark together? With people loitering in the carpark? Lol,btohqsg
Speedo nvr ask to cancel Jem meet,btohqsg
Approve by in charge the area not the mall,btohqsg
He just salty Becuz ppl going Speedo meet,btohqsg

lets move on from toxicity and move on to positivity üëç,btohqsg
Ohhhh. Sound like truck loads of fun. ü§£,btohqsg
usually these meets specifically chill ones jst meant for car owners to come by and jst chat  but still need approval ah so that police wont shut down the meet,btohqsg
then we have the other side of meets such as the BSMNT1 kallang meet,btohqsg
cnk and hdc best car meets,btohqsg
yeah these meets the best if youre looking just to look around in a relaxing morning,btohqsg
night meets are messy and wild,btohqsg

So in a nutshell basically just lotsa cars gathering at 1 carpark. Hahahaha,btohqsg

Ya..... Not everything jem fault. His background like shit but that's not a reason to side with the others,btohqsg
Exactly  this time it was purely my fault. I stood up realized and apologized üôè,btohqsg
i still dont get this jem thing,btohqsg
i literally work at jem HAHA,btohqsg
even a demon needs to work for money,btohqsg

If im not wrong w martini decal,btohqsg
To be fair  the ass is insane,btohqsg
aiya i got more ass la,btohqsg
what is that sppsed to mean,btohqsg
The eurocars plate frame still thr haha,btohqsg
i swear green can never suit shit,btohqsg
Usually after the hands of other dealers they change to their own plate holders i think,btohqsg
HOW DOES LIME GREEN LOOK OKAY,btohqsg
And you can buy the plate frame,btohqsg
You'd be surprised how many PI mercs have the c&c badge and frame,btohqsg
i searched it on google lol,btohqsg
it doesnt look good on fc tho,btohqsg
U can put ur name on the plate frame,btohqsg
i swear lime green looks shit on everything,btohqsg
As long as the plate is legal  your plate frame can customize to anything apart from illegal ads like cigarettes,btohqsg
I did not think about that,btohqsg
eh then that mclaren not lime green eh,btohqsg
i forgot i had it as my pfl,btohqsg
i mean its not rlly green,btohqsg
its like a mix of yellow,btohqsg
but with editing magic i made it green,btohqsg
hmm okay ill agree w that,btohqsg
oh fuckk not the rb kit,btohqsg
No its free when u purchase a car w them,btohqsg
atleast u manage to prove me wrong,btohqsg
isokay diff ppl got diff opinions !,btohqsg
The huracan one is Verde Mantis,btohqsg
The one I was talking about,btohqsg
ill respect u for hving ur own opinion ngl,btohqsg
My dad almost wanted to get glb,btohqsg
some ppl wtv other ppl like thn they fllw oni no matter how burok,btohqsg
They 3rd row is for dogs,btohqsg
I'd rather an x3 at that price,btohqsg
Can tune if you want to,btohqsg
I dl the looks of x3,btohqsg
Glb looks like a mini g wagon,btohqsg
Thrown in 35k more you can get an rsq3,btohqsg
But we didnt get it anyways,btohqsg
Glb meant to look like mini GLS,btohqsg
My das didnt buy cuz not worth it,btohqsg
Coe higher then whr the clouds are,btohqsg
That's how it's going to be for a while now,btohqsg
But my fam cant sustain in his current shitbox,btohqsg
Surge in phv and car sharing,btohqsg
Go used for a few years,btohqsg
Parf 3 to 4 years left,btohqsg
Bluesg and all use reg at domestic,btohqsg
I dont think my dad wld thoo,btohqsg
Even if they reg for business use,btohqsg
COE total quota stays the same,btohqsg
You shift from here to there,btohqsg
First alphard then glb now cx8,btohqsg
Total number of cars on the roads will be fixed,btohqsg
As in the cars that my fam looking at,btohqsg
If the cost of a new car is too high because of COE right now,btohqsg
Singapore still have a lot of good used units that haven't been screwed over with the surge of full loans and cheap mods,btohqsg
Works at cafe can get that also,btohqsg
Who still wan buy used car,btohqsg
No offense if this person is here,btohqsg
gna try working retail next time,btohqsg
But q expected for a coe bmw,btohqsg
But he is quite stupidFirst test drive car see issues  still place deposit saying get the stuff fixed but never sign contractThen upon handover accept car transfer to his name even though repairs were not madeSome more go to media and tell them the inflated price that was mentioned on paper for full loan when the car actually costs much lesser,btohqsg
Why accept transfer of vehicle if it wasn't done up to your agreed terms?,btohqsg
There are still some great units out there regardless of age,btohqsg
Drive better than what they did out of factory as well,btohqsg
Like I said  if you know what you're doing  you can find great cars out there,btohqsg
It all boils down to how the owner drive what he done and alot of other things,btohqsg
You need to be able to figure that out in that short test drive  looking at the listing  PPI if you really decide to move forward with the unit,btohqsg
2nd hand dealers let u test drive meh,btohqsg
Lemon law doesn't help this guy,btohqsg
His engine hasn't seized up neither has his gearbox blown,btohqsg
He accepted the car in that condition upon handover,btohqsg
A very hard case to fight for him,btohqsg
Plus I doubt he would want to take it to court knowing he's on a full loan which is already against MAS lending rules,btohqsg
He probably wanted the badge ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Thought he could get it for cheap,btohqsg
Ok i think got ppl angry alr i shuddap,btohqsg
But first time buyer so not much knowledge on what to look for,btohqsg
Jn got ppl try mute me,btohqsg
It's just a generalization made thanks to the abundance of cheaply modified and poorly maintained cars on the market,btohqsg
I having chill talk w arnav,btohqsg
Then y ppl go for bmw?,btohqsg
There's some really bad condition w204s and CLAs out there too,btohqsg
Rwd  easier to make them look like an upkitted M car  bmw known to be better driver's car from the base levels,btohqsg
Yuppp most bigger brands need to go hybrid with the number of cars they produce to keep total emissions low,btohqsg
That's why you see cars from the 90s to 00s now heavily increasing in value,btohqsg
If you see cars from 2015+ with all the screens and stuff,btohqsg
All of them damn dated already,btohqsg
You see 2016 A class or CLA and see the current gen,btohqsg
And in turn these middle era cars will just tank and won't hold value as well as their older counterparts,btohqsg
Let's see what you think of it in the next 3 years,btohqsg
The CLA  gla  A  B  GLC  G  GLE  GLS screens all dated already,btohqsg
You see the new EQs  the new C and S,btohqsg
3 years later Mercedes will come in with another design,btohqsg
U need to turn ur head to look at the infortaintment,btohqsg
Last time cars could last how long? 10-15 years easily,btohqsg
Now getting to 10 years globally also hard,btohqsg
I preder the 2 screen layout,btohqsg
Still need to do that in the 2 screen layout,btohqsg
And why would you be looking at the infotainment when driving?,btohqsg
Nope u oni need to turn ur eyes abit,btohqsg
Once you start driving you see what the difference is,btohqsg
Theirs is still curved towards the driver,btohqsg
Bmw infotainment usually focussed towards the driver,btohqsg
U just said bmw drivers car,btohqsg
But dont u think the s63 grille,btohqsg
It the panamerica and like a charging port,btohqsg
There's only 5 of these in the world,btohqsg
I believe this is the only one with this grille,btohqsg
This looks more like a California,btohqsg
Coachbuilt to pay homage to the 250 Lusso and the 166MM,btohqsg
Has the lights of a cali T seems like it,btohqsg
Guys be honest is this good?,btohqsg
anyone knows people who brings in osgiken other than stpowered?,btohqsg
For the big guys in our group üëåüèΩ,btohqsg
new audio for tiktok thx bro,btohqsg
Can anyone add me in tt,btohqsg
Keep in mind this just 2.5k rpm,btohqsg
Got  a stage 4 gti and FD2R video also,btohqsg
Hahaha later u viral the video cfm i and friend kena,btohqsg
If ur m3 cannot smoke fd2r idk wat to say,btohqsg
