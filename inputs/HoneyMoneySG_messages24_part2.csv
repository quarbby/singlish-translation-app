Any sign up bonus for ocbc?,btohqsg
Frank card is nerf now  uob evol is much better,btohqsg
uob one card cash back at 3.33 percent goes by quarterly. So u need to hit the minimum monthly  one missed and your cash back will be gone.for your instant  travel is accepted is not excluded.,btohqsg
Your best bet will be at citi reward  because citi reward runs a very wide range and if is not included in the exclusion list  likely is accepted whereas for revo  u got to be careful cause it runs on whitelist. so if i were u  i will use the citi reward  cause likely is accepted.,btohqsg
either citi reward  dbs woman world are good choices.,btohqsg
be careful of scam fake account messaging you pretending to be honeymoney admin,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSG- the scammer in this group,btohqsg
Can always check singsaver  moneysmart or the bank website for the latest sign up promos.,btohqsg
Yep apply liao. Sms me successful.  Hope get next wk,btohqsg
Did this 2500 grab reward points help you retain/reach the higher tier e.g. Platinum?Been struggling to find ways to retain my Platinum  a few hours left before being downgraded zzz,btohqsg
tbh grabpay no longer useful anymore liao  I don't bother with keeping my platinum status,btohqsg
But it doesnâ€™t matter ah.. grab is still shit,btohqsg
After their new pricing model made a few mths back  making it user-unfriendly  there's significantly less crowds  imo...,btohqsg
Less ppl will use the card liao.,btohqsg
if i top up my CPF today  does it still has Income tax relief for YA 2023?,btohqsg
Can't even put in samsung pay,btohqsg
Too late cos it's alrdy weekend  after biz days...,btohqsg
There's a cutoff timing for top ups... Even though paynow is immediate,btohqsg
why say so? grabpay card can pay axs machine lah. and lots food center can use grab pay then earn 1.5% cashback with amex tcb,btohqsg
all these no need platinum status,btohqsg
just did a test paynow transfer of $10 It's shown immediately in my transaction history.So not sure if i should do so...,btohqsg
Yes  but it may not qualify for relief for YA2023....,btohqsg
At least it'll qualify for relief for YA2024....,btohqsg
i think liquid pay is better than grabpay lah. because normal cc will consider it as fast food. can get better cashback ratr,btohqsg
do you know whenâ€™s the cut off?I think still eligible  I topped up (MRSS) to parent cpf just now around 5pm  and the retirement dashboard on cpf site shows the tax relief is eligible for 2022.,btohqsg
Hi! I know there are many e-wallets out there like grab and your highly recommended instarem. These are more easier for younger students to get >18 years old.So what should we get,btohqsg
Since we canâ€™t get credit and I assume debit cannot beat all these unless you can do card stacking which I hear you mention quite a lot,btohqsg
Oh yes especially how do we get around the fact that u need a credit card for amaze,btohqsg
GXS 3.48 percent interest ? I read other review max is 1.58 percent leh,btohqsg
Quite a lousy product. Maybe target customer are those start to work or are studying etc.,btohqsg
For amaze  I wouldn't recommend using debit card because the amaze spread will be greater than the card rewards you'll receive  if any. Consider using Trust debit card  YouTrip  Revolut  etc,btohqsg
For travel  after using the $1k citi rewards+instarem combo  which is the next alternative? Not considering DBS woman card because of the 1 year expiry,btohqsg
Woman's Card won't give you anything for amaze anyway. Can consider using OCBC titanium Rewards or UOB Lady's Card for specific categories. Otherwise default to a 1.2-1.4 mpd card like Citi premiermiles or UOB PRVI MC,btohqsg
it's useful if using it as temporary cash parking for few days,btohqsg
Best Wishes to All in 2023 !I am looking for some guidance please. I have to make a significant payment to IRAS (about $40k) because I rolled over my FY 2020 & 2021I was thinking of signing up for cardup and Amex TCBWhat are your thoughts ?,btohqsg
You may like to consider signing up for a citibank credit card and use the Citi payall feature to pay the tax. Citi payall has a promo now till 31 Jan 2023 where you get 1.8mpd for citi payall paymentshttps://www1.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/other-services/payall,btohqsg
may i ask why you say so?ðŸ˜‚because amaze charge 2% fx fee i think  then citi rewards give you 2.25% cashback if you choose cashback. i ak wondering if i miss out something.,btohqsg
But Citi Rewards is a credit  not debit  card,btohqsg
Can i check for endowus  i brought S&P 500  how to i check my avg price? only can see the price i brought but how to see avg price for the dca i brought monthly??,btohqsg
Go to portfolio and click on the underlying funds to get the info,btohqsg
oh  i get it now hahaha. thanks! i just apply for amaze card and want make the most use of it.,btohqsg
Avg price you have to calculate yourself,btohqsg
but that latest price is the current price but where to see avg?,btohqsg
Used the activity tab to see the price that you bought it at,btohqsg
yup i saw the price i but... just wonder where to find the avg price.. guess i need to do an excel for it,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone knows if I can purchase physical NTUC vouchers to meet minimum spending and qualify for cash back as a new sign up for the standard chartered smart credit card ? Thanks in advance ðŸ˜‰,btohqsg
But hsbc revo will have fx transact fee?,btohqsg
it should count as eligible spend since it is just like buying groceries over the counter,btohqsg
For cashback it seems mostly the fees is more than the cashback right?,btohqsg
yes  the promo only worth it for miles users,btohqsg
