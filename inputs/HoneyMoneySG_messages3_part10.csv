Anyone knows about this on Tiger Brokers and able to explain? Found this on Tiger Desktop > Assets,btohqsg
I don't have a Tiger Brokers account but based on the description  it is similar to the SGX Securities Borrowing and Lending programme.When you long a share  you can lend it to the interested party and gain some interest during this period.,btohqsg
you need to read the detail  in the event that your share is on loaned and you want to sell the share  what do you need to do.,btohqsg

Please excuse my lack of knowledgeS&P 500  INX what is the difference to the rest like voo  cspx  spy?,btohqsg
S&P500 is the index  which only provides the constituents and weights of the companies. You cannot invest in index directly  but you can invest via exchange traded funds (ETF) that track the ETF,btohqsg
these three are just ETFs by different providers that track the same index,btohqsg
SPY is the oldest and largest and has the most liquidity. VOO is provided by Vanguard  which is famous for offering extremely cheap ETF. These two are quite similar,btohqsg
CSPX is provided by iShares (BlackRock)  this is UCITS fund and listed on UK exchange. The withholding tax is lower for this (15% WHT vs. normal 30%),btohqsg
Difference between S&P500 ETFs: VOO  SPY  CSPX,btohqsg

To remit usd from dbs to futu is it the same account number as remit sgd?,btohqsg
You better find out from futu. Rather than asking here.,btohqsg
Its ok. Seems like no one here use the function,btohqsg
I'm not sure about futu  but for Tiger  it will be automatically converted to SGD and then credited to your brokerage account,btohqsg
I did that months ago  maybe it was DBS or Tiger that did the conversion. just for your information,btohqsg

Which is the best platform to use for investing in the s&p 500 using cash? Understand that there's Vanguard VOO ETF  Black Rock CSPX and even Endowus Lion Global Infinity fund. Thanks.,btohqsg
Cspx on interactive brokers  fractional if needed. Drafted a video on this filming soon,btohqsg
If very small amount like me $100 then use Syfe,btohqsg
How does Syfe compare with Endowus? Both are investing in the Lion Global Infinity S&P 500 fund?,btohqsg
Just dont use cash on Endowus,btohqsg
Syfe is using custom portfolio to buy cspx,btohqsg
Is it because the fees charged by Endowus for cash investing is higher than Syfe?,btohqsg
