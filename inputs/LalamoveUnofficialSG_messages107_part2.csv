Tis only apply like long long time ago where car cam and smartphone is not out. I personally encounter last time. End up the other party never report and my case close after 3 years.,btohqsg

Haha. another time i also kena with a PHD doc. Find thousands of ways to siam. Than end up my insurance told me tat since he is a PR you no need to scare. My case will be 100%  50/50 so eventually his premium will cost him a big bomb if he die die wan to claim aganist u.,btohqsg
In the end he is a fking cheapo. drive a 7 series. damn bloody irratating. Keep calling me till i tell him what u wan now. if u don wan claim insurance. I poor guy no money to pay ur repair on ur 7 series.  Than in the end ask me for $250 and a private settlement letter and close the case.,btohqsg

At first i great him as sir. Than when he show me his IC is Tan so i call Mr Tan. end up knn so hao lian.,btohqsg
Of course he would deny.Under your motor insurance terms  you‚Äôre expected NOT to admit to wrongdoing at all to the other party‚Ä¶ if not that‚Äôs essentially a losing case for the legal coverage the policy entails.,btohqsg
He stupid cos as long he‚Äôs loaning to buy it  he owes more than you.That‚Äôs dumb üôÇ,btohqsg
84.‚Äî(1) If in any case owing to the presence of a motor vehicle on a road an accident occurs whereby damage or injury is caused to any person  vehicle  structure or animal  the driver of the motor vehicle shall stop and  if required to do so by any person having reasonable grounds for so requiring  give his name and address and also the name and address of the owner and the identification marks of the motor vehicle.(2) If in the case of any such accident as aforesaid the driver of the motor vehicle for any reason does not give his name and address to any such person as aforesaid  he shall report the accident at a police station or to a police officer as soon as reasonably practicable and  in any case  within 24 hours of the occurrence thereof.,btohqsg
a) Exchange Particulars of Parties Involved in the Accident and take note of the vehicle numbersb) Take photos of the scene of the accident and the damages to all vehicles.Call Your Insurer's Hotline for a Tow-Truck or further advice on the accidentReport the accident to your Insurer within 24 Hours or by the next working day.If you do not report an accident Your insurer may repudiate liability;Your No-Claims Discount may be docked upon the renewal of your policy; andYour insurer may cancel or refuse to renew your policy.,btohqsg
this is from the policy wording?,btohqsg
this should be from RTA 1961 i suppose,btohqsg
this is from my NTUC policy,btohqsg
"police officers are not lawyers. don't take the word for it hor.if some lawyer ask you ""why you report only AFTER 24 hours"".... you also will have a challenge to explain yourself... and let them buy your words. later the lawyer ask you the same thing.... ""police officer = lawyer?""obediently follow your insurer's policy instructions.",btohqsg
because if the police officer is legally trained.... then he/she would be wearing a white top + black bottoms and usually seen around the Courts  not in a police station.,btohqsg
