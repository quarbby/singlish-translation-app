Ye but nothing mention in the notes,btohqsg
Whenever I come across this type of customer  i will tell them...while your customer is waiting for the food  my family is waiting for me to return home for dinner. Safety FIRST!,btohqsg
Take note guys. Here waiting time 20mins. Called them earlier said 5 mins be ready. End up total 25Mins waiting. Tash tish tosh at ECP.,btohqsg
Yup just take note  if come here take ur time to pick up.,btohqsg
It's normal. They ownself slow and late then they rush delivery guy,btohqsg
Now is it cannot see the restaurant name when you taking order,btohqsg
Y the gp chat now become channel for spam n advertising ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇüßê,btohqsg
Isit sunday night always so quiet?  llm has no order for bike at all ü•≤,btohqsg
Need two more order for the quest,btohqsg
Think i am dead. No hope liao,btohqsg
Hope got order. It‚Äôs super fast gone,btohqsg
have to drop off before 2359 to count?,btohqsg
Think should be take order before 2359,btohqsg
Anyone looking for a van? I have nv350 auto for rent. $1285 per month.(cheapest so far). Requirements 22 years old above and 2 years driving experience. Sorry admin don't ban me üòÅ,btohqsg
This is the accident that I saw.,btohqsg
That's 1 reason y I don't take too advanced jobs especially now when dine in is opening up. Expect restos to b more bz n have possibility of late especially wkends,btohqsg
I know it's resto fault  but alot of times llm will side with them cos they r llm customers. We r drivers expendable,btohqsg
The restos don't care u early bro  they only care u late,btohqsg
Nxt time just tell them cancel if they so late  cos u have so many orders to go do. Not worth risking ur life to rush. Also not worth ur other orders late just for 1 ordee,btohqsg
Hi. Can i check what happens if the picture of lalabag and bike i send is not approved or I totally did not send?,btohqsg
Recently keep seeing pple say London fat duck at Scott's late. Last time I collect is ok leh,btohqsg
or is there a dress code,btohqsg
Don't wear competitors uniform or branding. Haha.,btohqsg
"are ""pick up now"" orders more attractive??",btohqsg
U look at the price lor,btohqsg
U feel the price acceptable then u do,btohqsg
you know lah leh lor ?,btohqsg
U noe what is KNN CCB?,btohqsg
want be a scammer also need to be efficient. A few of us only you cannot cope. How to tan jia?,btohqsg
in my country   our Grandma can move/workfaster than u.,btohqsg
Estonia is the country; why are they contacting us? ü§£,btohqsg
ninjaOS partners with delivery companies such as lalamove and pickupp,btohqsg
could i get a sensing here  have anyone tried other delivery platforms and which is the worst and best?,btohqsg
No1 wants do delivery if have a choice,btohqsg
Pple who like grab will say grab good,btohqsg
Pple who like panda will say panda good,btohqsg
Ur this qn is open ended what's the pt of asking,btohqsg
No..when I drove past  the deceased already covered with the white cloth. TP was already there.,btohqsg
Good morning Guys How do I claim this voucher after the completion of 7 orders for the last 3 mentioned days?Anyone here already claim the voucher?,btohqsg
What's this? I never use this before in lalamove. How you hear about this,btohqsg
Ninjaos is just saying they have more than a few delivery apps that they can use. Means if pple use ninjaos to do delivery  then ninjaos can sub to a few platforms to help do the delivery  so don't need worry no drivers n delay delivery,btohqsg
Tat day i kena compensation claim where i am not late at all.  Lucky i was chatting with my friend on whatapps saying tis industry place have a restaurant. I screenshots n show llm on the whatapps date n time. Tis ppl sux man,btohqsg
Basically llm quite a few companies will use their service. U got see ninjaos getz via move etc orders sometimes,btohqsg
"All the claims against me have come from oddle eats orders. N its those ""rescue"" jobs where its already past the delivery timing stated on the original job. I think the problem starts from oddle itself whereby they don't update or review the orders  n then when send complain to llm for late and want claim compensation  llm also don't do the review of the job.",btohqsg
Yes. Cos when they desperate need drivers  they will mass throw out,btohqsg
Whoever gets first or nearest then they will cancel the rest,btohqsg
There's 1 new platform getz  now also using llm,btohqsg
Same order 2 job  1 bike 1 car,btohqsg
I took the car job when the bike order still there,btohqsg
Then when I reached they had cancelled. Then the other llm guy came n pickup,btohqsg
They cancelled mine even though I got the job first. N I got to the resto b4 the bike job guyü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
The bike job cheaper than mine by 20centsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
So I don't take getz job anymore,btohqsg
Waste cp. Time n petrol ok cos I was very near  only 5 mins awat,btohqsg
I just don't take their order,btohqsg
Cos most of the time the control is via the platform they use,btohqsg
Unless it's the resto itself order via llm,btohqsg
If its those platforms using llm  then they can cancel anyhow n up to them. Even when u reach the resto,btohqsg
I kena b4  reach the resto liao. Show them the order  told me still preparing but cos I early so I ok,btohqsg
Then halfway thru  my job was cancelledü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
I ask the resto  they nvr cancel,btohqsg
Then they go check the apps page,btohqsg
The driver changed to another driver. They also cannot do anytg,btohqsg
The other driver the 1 he got no +$  n is not llm,btohqsg
It's the ordering platform that do this stunt,btohqsg
Alot of orders restos receive are thru pple ordering thru oddle  Chinatown platform etc,btohqsg
So the restos just prepare the food etc,btohqsg
It's like if u go thru oddle eat  u order from a certain resto  then oddle eats will send the order to the resto to prepare. Oddle eats in charge of getting the driver thru whichever delivery platform they decide to use,btohqsg
Restos have a chat gp with oddle etc,btohqsg
When they get a driver  they will be informed on the chat  who is the driver name etc,btohqsg
Sometimes when alot of orders etc,btohqsg
Even if the resto ask for cancellation,btohqsg
If oddle don't respond or do fast  also cannot cancel,btohqsg
Unless it's the resto ask for the driver direct using llm,btohqsg
If the resto forget or nvr tell oddle cancel  then the order also won't be cancelled,btohqsg
Resto nvr inform oddle food already picked up  so oddle nvr cancel  so still come out orders to llm,btohqsg
Or resto tell oddle liao  oddle haven't cancel the new orders sent to llm,btohqsg
Or oddle have difficulty informing llm maybe due to llm uncontactable  which I know happens  cos those resto order direct thru llm  also have to go thru cs which also very slowüòÇ,btohqsg
Got 1 time I reach the job was taken liao. I ask resto y nvr cancel. They show me they on livechat very long cs no replyüòÇ,btohqsg
So if pickup now jobs  which u see the time it appears is very late from original delivery time liao  better call n check with the resto b4 u go down pickupüòÇ,btohqsg
Another situation is resto cannot wait for llm drivers liao  they get other platform go pickup  then they either nvr inform oddle/llm  or inform liao then oddle/llm haven't cancel,btohqsg
All these is what I see b4 n kena b4. Maybe got other things or some of the above not correct. Everyone is welcome to share,btohqsg
I pickup those 6-7pm supposed to deliver. When I got the job is 8pm liao,btohqsg
Ah this type I suggest u screenshot the order once u got the job,btohqsg
N make a call to the resto,btohqsg
The screenshot n call log is for the compensation/late report which llm will send to u,btohqsg
I will always call the customer when I pick up the food n tell them resto couldn't get driver n I just pick up the food.,btohqsg
I always ask the resto when I reach if they had informed the customer. Most of them nvr call 1. Even if they say they will call  don't trust them. U better call. Cos a number of times the customer tell me they nvr got a call from resto,btohqsg
Just tell the customers what happened  most of the time they will know not ur fault. I nvr got scold by customer b4. Even got tip b4 for sending the foodüòÇ,btohqsg
Just remember cover ur backside for evrything. Cos no1 will protect us,btohqsg
"1 more thing. If the order is those ""rescue"" job  when u call the resto to cfm the order  let them know u about how long can reach. Some cannot wait so long then if got nearer driver take the job they will accept it. Then u reach liao u nothing to take. Waste time n peteol",btohqsg
Again all these is my own experience.,btohqsg
"To me ""rescue"" order is if let's say the job suppose to deliver btw 6-7  if already half hour gone liao  then u got the job  is rescue liaoüòÇ",btohqsg
Cos u need time to reach resto. Then deliver. By the time u deliver will be pass the inital delivery time frame,btohqsg
Cos if oddle want complain  they see u delivered the food pass the initial time liao  then complain u late. So I keep all the screenshot n call log,btohqsg
If u nearby or is gg to where u gg  y not pickup. Ok 1. Anything happen not ur fault as long as u have the proof. But of cos for rescue order try to deliver it first if u stack lahüòÇ,btohqsg
Wa good idea ah  at least you cover your backside. Going to follow this,btohqsg
I don't want for no reason have to pay or kena suspension,btohqsg
N pls keep in mind they don't send u the compensation/late sms immediately within next few days or the following week. They will send to u quite long after the job day. If u don't keep record  n u forget then very hard to track back n remember the details of what happen on that job,btohqsg
At least 1 month i keep the log later then delete should be ok?,btohqsg
Another way is I will call the recipient when I reacg the resto. Tell them resto couldn't get driver. N I reacg soon. When I collect the food I will inform u. Then when u collect the food u sms the recipient. Saying u just collected the food.,btohqsg
Then u can keep the sms as proof also that its not u late.,btohqsg
Then u have the recipient hp number saved in the sms  can always key in keypad will come out show when n what time u called the recipient.,btohqsg
Make ur life easier don't need worry abt complaints,btohqsg
Ya but i show it with photo of the shop i chatting. Den llm lan lan,btohqsg
Worst part is u reached n restaurant ask u wait. Than after 30min they told u cancel.  Than best ans is i dunno leh.,btohqsg
Is the pick up now orders getting lesser?,btohqsg
As most of them went back office to work,btohqsg
Ahhh  thought I kena restrictions of some sort,btohqsg
this month alot of 4pm orders for muslim recipients,btohqsg
If they really so concerned abt the timing etc  then don't order bike then ask for car preference,btohqsg
I'm sure if they order car job very fast will have car take,btohqsg
Does anyone fail or hardly get back the deposit from LLM?,btohqsg
Later end up traffic jam for cars‚Ä¶. And only bikes can still filter through the jams‚Ä¶.üòÖ,btohqsg
In future  see this order  dont take !,btohqsg
This client stated $21.80 with misleading address given. When we ask for actual address  he change the price to $16.80,btohqsg
Then Live CS not working at all,btohqsg
This pax using LLM Loophole to bully rider by putting misleading address and change it after we click the order,btohqsg
How can he change the price?,btohqsg
The address like incomplete sia. 110 where,btohqsg
The app easy to book why they lazy,btohqsg
This buyer purposely put misleading address for both collection and sending address,btohqsg
Complain llm for 30mins  also dead chat,btohqsg
Change price after we confirm the order,btohqsg
Where did the original geolocation show  when you first tapped on it?,btohqsg
I usually would first tap on the ??? locations to understand first,btohqsg
Both shows block 101 of dunno where,btohqsg
By add blk  the price chang,btohqsg
Based on 1st screenshot  the block is other location.,btohqsg
1st screenshot also no put actual location. Whole spore had many blk 101,btohqsg
The map shows other locations. Thay why I said misleading address,btohqsg
He can bully us once  Godcwill punish him,btohqsg
By the way  I had block him and give him 1 star rating,btohqsg
O.This pax is using llm loophole to bully riders,btohqsg
Live chat is totally a DEAD CHAT  hold 30 mins also no 1 there,btohqsg
What's the difference between them cancelling and us cancelling?,btohqsg
If we wait for the order at the receiving point  do we get extra money for waiting,btohqsg
Grab  food panda  etc. Delivery price had increase BUT only llm not increase price :(,btohqsg
Ohh icic I thought there may be some penaltiesb,btohqsg
For eg this means 7:49 onwards I get paid 2 bucks/10min?,btohqsg
Tan yu some outlet always late,btohqsg
If high price wait awhile ok,btohqsg
U got the job order at 742,btohqsg
Eh! Can block Ah? I need to block at least one shop that is my Fan.,btohqsg
U go do more jobs n see the breakdown of the prices u will know where the tips come from,btohqsg
Oh! Thank you!Is this only available for ongoing jobs; or when viewing the past job with the said client?,btohqsg
Red tag order  cannot see the detail at all until you confirm the order,btohqsg
Recently i keep kena. Etc address stated pick up jurong send to jurong. But when you click sender address the map will show u punggo address But the price is jurong to jurong,btohqsg
I also kena b4. Llm map very lousy,btohqsg
Can we revisit old live chat?,btohqsg
I was live chatting regarding my waiting compensation but riding at the same time and couldn't reply and he just closed the chag,btohqsg
Nxt time when order is late,btohqsg
Don't care if cs is in yet,btohqsg
When collect food liao continue write what time collected want claim fee etc,btohqsg
Then carry on ur job. Some cs will auto help u do claim,btohqsg
If the Cs no say anytg n leave,btohqsg
Help u keep track of the actual time food collected etc also,btohqsg
All same. Just want to let customers abuse the system and lowball.,btohqsg
Aren't u eligible for $2 extra compensation too,btohqsg
$2 waiting fee is not exactly $2. Llm will take 18% of tht $2,btohqsg
If llm can take 10 or 12% best,btohqsg
Sometimes it's not about the comms,btohqsg
It's the support and the nett earnings,btohqsg
0% Comms shit price u want or not?,btohqsg
Got 1 booking on other app $6 no Comms you want do?,btohqsg
When you see the price on no Comms is even cheaper than the than nett price with Comms see whether you will dulan or not.,btohqsg
Which Petrol station do you guys pump?,btohqsg
Llm giving 25% off for sinopec right,btohqsg
You guys actually go in malls to park? Instead of at the road side?,btohqsg
Kena mall cp cheaper or kena summon cheaper,btohqsg
Most carpark got grace period.. at least you can bang on that chance. And safer,btohqsg
But peak period  hotspot like orchard  better get a job with + to offset the parking.,btohqsg
Taka even if got grace period also no use,btohqsg
Inside mall big. Then during peak period  car stuck in cp cos alot of cars queuing up to go out cos outside the road jam,btohqsg
Safety vest for construction site  even van pricing also not worth  especially return trip,btohqsg
$28.90Nett earnings $24.28Round trip distance 16.4km*2 = 32.8kmPetrol (11km/litre) - 2.98litrePetrol Cost less 25% discount - $6.71$17.57 for 1h25min job (assume 25 min each direction and 10 min per location),btohqsg

you have bicycle or ebike? or really really just walking?,btohqsg
can use the in-app filter screen for the nearer short distance jobs.,btohqsg
In app filter not very accurate,btohqsg
but will make a lot more on a bicycle account on panda or grab. llm jobs mostly quite far.,btohqsg
Better to use Google map check,btohqsg
Ever saw an auntie riding those Brompton bicycle behind using the same lalabag for motorbike. Crusing along simpang bedok...during the evening....,btohqsg
Maybe go buy groceries using lalabaggie üòú,btohqsg
Whatever it is...u need to have at least motorbike. Becoz every month every lala agents regardless of what vehicular will need to take a photo of the branding which is bag or stickers for cars and above,btohqsg
Anyway  thanks. I will try and see what happens next. Thanks broüôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Just saw a motorbike job but need trolley because it's a washing machine. And someone actually bid the job  omgüòÖ,btohqsg
If only we can ban those type of consumers,btohqsg
Hi Rachel  thanks for the info. Where is Tbh ? If I start I really don't mind the job loads  I just try out to gain experience. Your sharing means to me. By the way  I have not submit my deposit  and do you know any of the coverage areas at Woodlands? Good dayüòáüòáüòá,btohqsg
Actually there can be jobs short distance suitable for walkers  but u have to check if there's alot of stuff to deliver. If so  may be difficult for you to deliver also.,btohqsg
Some even call grab if the fare is low enough n the job price is good enough. Can stacküòÇ,btohqsg
Wah like that how much per job siA,btohqsg
If I'm not wrong got no jobs labelled as walker,btohqsg
That's y u see some bike jobs will write no walkers pls,btohqsg
Actually i feel might be better register with grab panda etc as walker or bike,btohqsg
Then can on llm app see can stack extra or not lor,btohqsg
I'm mostly in town  sometimes can see jobs in town suitable for walkers,btohqsg
Not alot of pple want to take,btohqsg
Whereas is walker  take already can walk to the drop off,btohqsg
I ever considered parking somewhere then just take the jobs. Slowly walk since got 1 hr,btohqsg
Often see a multi stop job,btohqsg
Paragon or taka deliver to mbs then back,btohqsg
Walkers can take  but dunno alot of things to deliver or notüòÇ,btohqsg
Or paragon to taka then back to paragon,btohqsg
Pan pac limited space to park worüòÇ,btohqsg
The good things was LLM never demanding you must pick. Is a own time own target work  freelance we have the choice to accept the order am I right to say that?,btohqsg
U have choice to bid for the job,btohqsg
Yah  but everytime I want park there no space liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
So I don't take sommerset alsoüòÇ,btohqsg
Other food platforms throw u the job,btohqsg
Llm u need bid for the job  got freedom,btohqsg
Laugh as in high or low,btohqsg
Last time can b very high. Nowdays nvr go up high then kena snatchedü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
Last time can nowdays more difficult. Last time can be 50+ after commission,btohqsg
Ok guys and gals enjoy your day. Remember this  the choice is yours  do not force yourself  there is always a way  bye bye n God bless.,btohqsg
i think this is a glitch in the app. happens for my android,btohqsg
"i mean the ""something is wrong"" remark. when i choose the job   i havent swipe to accept it. it would say that remark",btohqsg
wished they specify before taking order,btohqsg
This kind I would not take. Odds are stacked in favour of being a bad surprise üòõ,btohqsg
if we accept and realised its cheapskate,btohqsg
we can just cancel w/o penalty?,btohqsg
anyone got checkpoint fuel update group?,btohqsg
if never specify washing machine then motorcycle kena washing machine,btohqsg

Anyone able to claim waiting fee from 126 race course road just now?,btohqsg
Quite expected the restaurant was uncontactable by LLM as they were in a mess,btohqsg
Was really delay by the stupid resturant and they deduct my earning !!!!,btohqsg
"Clear the t&c already stated we cant stack orders regards what mode of vehicular. Some more ""they"" knew we are stacking the orders together....may i ask your mode of transportation? Also u email to them regarding the merchant is later when u arrive to pick up your order?",btohqsg
.....no stacks means no enough profit....,btohqsg
Restaurant slow and late expect you to send immediately.,btohqsg
Alot of this kind of CB kia,btohqsg
When they customers complain they push to delivery.,btohqsg
Ya...the moment i reach there i quickly sweep reached pick up point.,btohqsg
we have 1 hr from the time we collect the food,btohqsg
for oddle delivery must we contact thembeforehand? cos llm prompt me havent contact user..,btohqsg
Tdy cannot get any bid. Either job appear click on it  its gone or taken or bid lose. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
U were delayed by which restaurant?,btohqsg
Walao reach zaffron at great world. 6pm order. 6.30 tell me still need 20 mins. I stack another order T.T this time gg alr,btohqsg
Tdy I think alot resto gg to be late sia,btohqsg
Sorry anyone know is yesterday got holiday surcharge,btohqsg
How do yall prevent spillage of soup in box??,btohqsg
Shell followed Caltex in raising 5c,btohqsg
If your box has partitions that can withstand the weight of the containers with soup  good for you.I use old pillows to keep things in place in my bike.,btohqsg
Is it me or is it now no orders,btohqsg
Aft update  My phone apply filter then cannot see any order liao ü•≤,btohqsg
Now night time no orders at all??,btohqsg
shopping mall alot ppl all celebrating in restoran for post covid sg,btohqsg
Then need to keep waiting üò¢,btohqsg
How isit that when I click the order  its already taken up,btohqsg
When it just appears on my screen,btohqsg
Tdy hv to fight for orders,btohqsg
These 2 days very very very hard to win bids  get orders,btohqsg
so now bag (and maybe later sticker) got extra benefits.,btohqsg
Bike put sticker at where sia,btohqsg
with lalabag can see more orders?,btohqsg
I suppose so coz every mth they ask me take pic of the bag. If no diff for what take pic,btohqsg
with bag   can filter immidiate order location also i guess,btohqsg
I no bag also can filter,btohqsg
Everyone have this since the update of the app a while ago  nothing to do with lalabag,btohqsg
Looking closely  I did not have the immediate orders option  my apologies,btohqsg
But what is the difference between Now or immediate,btohqsg
Now FP giving free bags  LLM still want us to buy,btohqsg
Personally  the user interface to filter for the locations was quite clunky  so this new ‚Äúrequirement‚Äù makes no difference to me scrolling down the list of jobs available.,btohqsg
Instead of those names they came up with  I‚Äôd personally rather something like District 9  56 etc‚Ä¶ and show the exact address.Having the address on one single line with line feed  then unit number on the next would be a LOT tidier than this implementation.,btohqsg
Just to keep track of how far I‚Äôve clocked in mileage  I just tried to key in the locations manually in Google Sheets and have it total up the distance I clocked just for the Start-End of the day. Good for tracking my odometer too.,btohqsg
Not full time doing LLM so got time üòõ,btohqsg
"for now this ""feature"" is a bit too clunky.if anyone wanted to know where the ""Now"" jobs are  the app already is sucking power from the phone for geolocation  why not base on that as default... cos 20 minutes later i'm in Bukit Batok instead of Pasir Ris  why would i want to see ""Now"" jobs starting from Pasir Ris? lol",btohqsg
Yes. Some even the job come out u press no chance to bid even,btohqsg
Isit no one like to go sentosa deliver?,btohqsg
Sentosa full of humps n speed camera. N mostly deliver to very inside. Plus condo,btohqsg

For motorbike delivering? Alamak.Could you share your source of information? Kamsia,btohqsg
what happoens if we spill soup or drink ah,btohqsg
then how to not spill ah,btohqsg
no way to tie it down,btohqsg
also have the big thermal bag,btohqsg
Old pillows. Not too thick  so you can roll them up to keep things upright.,btohqsg
Yah  make sure ur box or thermal bag is packed so won't topple,btohqsg
GLASS bottles - break one  you pay for the product.some places may have a LOT of cardboard you can tear to try to pad the bottles from each other.eh.... this one primary school problem solving leh. the soup question was still quite ok leh.... glass bottle  you think you go over a hump  or pothole  the glass will not crack?,btohqsg
claim from manufacturer. their glass too laoya,btohqsg
Alcohol delivery if it‚Äôs those online whisky etc seller ok. They sell alcohol come with the boxing. But depends. Kena soju can cry  especially lose packing. Scared break,btohqsg
I self ban the alcohol seller at lower delta one. Waste my time  arrive there or drive halfway cancel order.,btohqsg
Textile centre level 2 the alcohol guy not bad  just the parking headache for drivers. Riders should be ok,btohqsg
When u ready to be penalized 50% when late  then gv it a try. CS a bit better since chat trail is there but no immediate response.,btohqsg
Isit just me or today few orders üòÇ,btohqsg
y everyday come here sure got ppl complain no orders,btohqsg
Timing. Lala usually just before lunch and dinner a lot of orders. Plus if have extra $3 on ph but not some special day like mother day or Xmas  some customers don‚Äôt use lala,btohqsg
Orders have been getting lesser since sg slowly opening up lah. This is the new norm. If want to do llm then have to get used to it. During covid more orders got less drivers. Now opening up more drivers join. More orders they don't join. Less orders now then come doü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg

No bro  now alot of cases ah long use this delivery so send us to the one who own money,btohqsg
Then later we reach   end we are the one who kena also . Kena played by them,btohqsg
Just beware lah i kena before at woodland. Put cash order . Thought really cash sekali kena waste my petrol go there,btohqsg
Should be okey. Quite common.. in credit tetms,btohqsg

Bcz just now i on  its like the same notes that the person who place the order all the same but all diffirent location,btohqsg
Check with u guys now all can be seen only scheduled order is it? Or its just me.,btohqsg
Sunday morning not much immediate jobs lah. Still early,btohqsg
How u count? I only count the time I actually spend driving to pick up n drop off. When la kopi waiting for jobs I no count worüòÇ,btohqsg
If count sure very low mah the rate  nowdays so little jobs n hard to win bids,btohqsg
I count it from the time I leave house and start riding,btohqsg
I average only 16/hr w/o factoring petrol cost and all,btohqsg
hello just picked this and was wondering it says 3hrs  meaning complete the orders within 3hrs?,btohqsg
No it means 3hrs to collection,btohqsg
Heavy rain but crap price. Siu gang liao,btohqsg
as usual. llm getting more n more jialat,btohqsg
now jobs are getting lesser n lesser but llm is still advertising to find more drivers to join them. wtf! üòÇüòÖ,btohqsg
So that the jobs will continue low price mah,btohqsg
With more drivers  even if the price is shit also taken,btohqsg
So llm customers will not need pay alot n so will keep using llm lor,btohqsg
Not worth it in this weather. Super heavy rain  bad visibility and a bit dangerous too. Not to mention sure get wet. Worse thing is when customer keep asking eta,btohqsg
no cost to them what... they not paying is salary,btohqsg
later cannot see clearly  become next malaysian Ê≤àÂèØÂ©∑ ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
ya right. llm only taking 20% from all our hard work  be it rain or shine.,btohqsg
Saw this post! Hope this helps alot of drivers here üò¨üò¨üò¨,btohqsg
I think is bullshit. Must be fare cheaper. Where got driver already took food liao then ask him come back for official driver. Rubbish.,btohqsg
They double booked  cancelled one but accidentally gave it to the cancelled driver  and since the chosen (official) driver turned up they asked the other guy to come back. The other guy wont get paid even if he completed the (cancelled) order.,btohqsg

Like I said  not abt how much I can get back liao. It's abt our entitlement n rights. I don't want everytime let them play me,btohqsg
That time I kena same as ur case  I call n cfm with recipient liao cos resto no answer call. Then I reach the mall they cancel. I tell Cs give me cancellation fee. They give me all sorts of reasons  say when they cancel I haven't reach resto etc so cannot claim. I f them upside down  show what is written in the other fees section in the app.,btohqsg
Tell them I follow all ur procedures liao now u say cannot claim. Then they say training prog procedure not like that  I say don't give me this shit. In the end also lan lan give me the fee,btohqsg
