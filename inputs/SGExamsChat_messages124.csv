thought this was a forex ad or smth at the start LMAO,btohqsg
What forex ads have you been reading LOL,btohqsg
life is suffering. but thanks to@waterflowi learnt how to save money through this crisis smth smth smth,btohqsg
Thanks for that suggestion  now I know what to do,btohqsg
Attention all! Life is suffering  but thanks tomathematicsyou can gain a deeper understanding of all things  and that includes life itself. Ever wondered how the world seems to be a bunch of solutions topartial differentiation equations? Well  with (years of intense) studies in mathematics  you can push our boundary of knowledge  one which the genius Terence Tao also helped to push!,btohqsg
Anyway IDK  I never went private before.I've heard good things  but I'm a bit sceptical about the prices,btohqsg
why visit private when u can visit polyclinic for free,btohqsg
CAT 1 all day err day,btohqsg
MINDEF FACEBOOK (wtf they have fb lmao?),btohqsg
but tbh its quite boring the whole thing,btohqsg
I guess if you can afford it,btohqsg
except the mp sometimes quite funny,btohqsg
??? my math not so good,btohqsg
Hey guys  which poly is popular for IT?,btohqsg
but at the same time its compact and super convenient for doing notes and all,btohqsg
the og gen one i think,btohqsg
but if you only need it for doing notes  surfing web and watching videos its perfect for it,btohqsg
why buy an expensive device capable of so much but only use it for menial tasks  must as well get a cheap one that does just fine,btohqsg
dont hate on android my man,btohqsg
Do you guys look down on SIM GE?,btohqsg
Carousel if you dont have trust issues,btohqsg
Android tablets have very small software library and support,btohqsg
They're not going to last very long,btohqsg
that amount of money can get u more than enough pen and paper,btohqsg
I have like 3 ipads i dont use anymore lol,btohqsg
Can nego w me if you want hoho,btohqsg
Damb and I thought me not using my ipad ever since leaving sec sch was a waste,btohqsg
The latest one i have is ipad air i think,btohqsg
can la but likeif u take second hand no warranty abit urm ah,btohqsg
it‚Äôll only be as pretty as you make it out to be,btohqsg
I was kidding btw i aint got no ipads lmfao,btohqsg
refurbished and new like not much price diff,btohqsg
like might as well save one more month or what to buy a new one üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I thought you were gonna say it'll only be as pretty as you LOL,btohqsg
they only got ipad mini and ipad pro i think,btohqsg
Wish Singapore retail can adopt return policy like the US and EU,btohqsg
we have a east coast plan,btohqsg
the big man himself was opposite my school today  wanted to ask him what his plan was,btohqsg
Said big man used to be in my constituency,btohqsg
His plan is to east coast,btohqsg
like macam no one give their stuff to appl,btohqsg
does apple pay u or smth,btohqsg
We care üë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë® at East Coast üë©‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®üòç,btohqsg
Suddenly got chosen so stage fright alr  anyhow plan for east coast,btohqsg
I have a plan for east coast,btohqsg
I have a together at east coast plan,btohqsg
im gonna make a meme of that,btohqsg

How else are you supposed to feel,btohqsg
How old are you  old man? üò±,btohqsg
Should have done that for my pw 2 yrs ago lol,btohqsg
Instead we did jc latecoming as a crisis,btohqsg
Wait  this is counted as a crisis?,btohqsg
The most important disaster facing humanity today,btohqsg
It makes a lot of sense to me now,btohqsg
Pap in the 1960s: LEADERS NEED TO HAVE THE IRON IN THEMpap today:I care--- for east coastI have a together at east coast plan,btohqsg
Pick a topic make it fit,btohqsg
funny as it may be but i feel bad for him :(,btohqsg
apparently it was some speech difficulty left over from his stroke in 2016,btohqsg
I've never watched one of his speeches so i wouldn't know oof,btohqsg
TIL the together we care at east coast plan is a real thing,btohqsg
or else ill xue hua piao piao,btohqsg
Actl ah why does it sound like there is a he between xue and hua,btohqsg
He‚Äôs dragging the last vowel of xue,btohqsg
sgexams is a flex ground :(,btohqsg
But there are so many RSAF weebs,btohqsg
Forever relevant even in modern contexts,btohqsg
i dont think this is the correct place to ask,btohqsg

I dreamed that I got #98 place in a PUBG match,btohqsg
I hadn‚Äôt even picked up a gun yet,btohqsg
Can any guy here do a girl voice like legit,btohqsg
My subject combination is eng chinese combined science and a math and e math,btohqsg
Can i enrol to poly without humanities,btohqsg
but you won't be able to choose humanities related courses,btohqsg
the relevant subjects differ based on the category,btohqsg
Look at the minimum entry requirements for the courses u want,btohqsg
which party is wisely running for,btohqsg
Anyone here took today's physics olympiad?,btohqsg
Tfw you about to sleep and someone calls you now you cant go back to sleep,btohqsg
This makes it seem like maths is the emperor  physics is the empress  and the rest of academia is the harem,btohqsg
Cant wait to watch movie alone,btohqsg
Mind sharing a copy of the paper?,btohqsg
I have hope in our future now,btohqsg
More like maths and physics are the harem of the other subjects,btohqsg
Any tips on how to study for chinese oral,btohqsg
Get gd grades for english combinedf science(phy/chem) e math and a math,btohqsg
The reason this works is because most candidates learn muscle memory from this. You don't need to know anything at O/A-levels  you just need to know to write what when given prompts.,btohqsg
I join my private school this year damn late,btohqsg
It's the fastest and easiest way,btohqsg
I dont know about many of the concept also,btohqsg
Google it or ask it at the O/N/A chat,btohqsg
Try to book consultation with your subject teachers,btohqsg
What methods do y'all use to study?,btohqsg
Consult  tuition  TYS  ask friends/online...is there anything else,btohqsg
The worst subject that exist  geography.,btohqsg
Practice papers and consult on them,btohqsg
Practicing tells u where u r lacking  then consult tells u how to fix your issues,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a cycle of consolidating and updating your knowledge,btohqsg
Like no have alot consultation eh,btohqsg
Anyone frm Private dip here? Or joining soon,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the point of a school with teachers you can‚Äôt talk to,btohqsg
May as well just get tuition instead,btohqsg
Private school is like that one,btohqsg
Using R programming  create the function MyFunc that receives a given vector  and returns a new vector contains all elements of the first vector without duplicate. For example: MyFun(c(2  2  3  1  1  0))  result : [1] 2 3 1 0.and some modelling question from scratch  but easy dataset,btohqsg
Any idea on how to tackle this,btohqsg
Compile the data into a listLoop over each index to check duplicatesRemove duplicatesSave new lsit in another variable,btohqsg
As for how u would loop over to check got a few ways,btohqsg
Id do something using multiple variables,btohqsg
Store original list in var1Make a copy of var1 and remove a certain element with a unique indexThen if exists the elemet in the list where it is removed  thus it has a duplicate. Remove it and then recurse,btohqsg
Not sure about R but python has a count method/functuon that does this for u,btohqsg
So does most languages i think maybe u should check documentation,btohqsg
I cant take you srsly with that username,btohqsg
You werent the one who asked the ques. I dont care what you take me as.,btohqsg
"Bro haha lim tean ""whats common between pap and hdb?""""They are both worthless in the long run""",btohqsg
I wanna see tcb  jamus  csj  lim tean in parliament,btohqsg
I might actually start watching debates,btohqsg
LTK's Titanic meme was still the most lit imo,btohqsg
Holy crap imma check that out,btohqsg
How did I miss all these,btohqsg
Has anyone tried the app ‚Äúsignal‚Äù,btohqsg
Honestly you should be able to do this,btohqsg
Perhaps u could offer a non recursion solution. Instead of merely criticising.,btohqsg
MyFun <- function(x){if (isTRUE(all.equal(x  c(2 2 3 1 1 0)))){return(c(2 3 1 0))}}MyFun(c(2 2 3 1 1 0)),btohqsg
Recursion is useful if you need to repeatedly apply some function again and again  starting from whatever the input is.In this case I don't see how you need more than 1 parse,btohqsg
Thanks  I worked hard to find the relevant functions in R Core,btohqsg
My function applies the helper functiom repeatedly. Thus recursion. I am aware what recursion is used for.,btohqsg
Exactly why would you need to repeatedly use a helper function,btohqsg
Cause i like it? I am more comfortable with it ? It is ONE of many possible ways?,btohqsg
Thats a weird thing to ask.,btohqsg
Plus i also said that i am not aware of in built functions of R,btohqsg
I mean if that isnt enough then i guess nothing would satiate u.,btohqsg
It doesn't matter. It's not a hard question.,btohqsg
Woops forgot to show my enthusiasm.,btohqsg
By 'not a hard question' I mean that asking here  plus asking about another 'modelling question from scratch' means it's pretty pointless to answer.,btohqsg
Anyway the only issue I have is that in a naive method of doing the question in R  it probably won't use space well.,btohqsg
I guess that doesn't matter if the asker somehow can't think of a way of making the function,btohqsg
MyFun <- function(x){if (isTRUE(all.equal(x  c(2 2 3 1 1 0)))){return(c(2 3 1 0))}}MyFun(c(1 1 1 1 1 1))Oh wait this doesnt work. Perhaps because it is hardcoded.,btohqsg
Well i guess it shouldnt be hard to google a modular version of this.,btohqsg
Or perhaps one that works with any input.,btohqsg
What do you mean it doesn't work?,btohqsg
Also I don't see why you need to include your own comments in the ``` but/shrug- it's supposed to be a code block,btohqsg
@junhengggggghere have something to laugh at.,btohqsg
Do you know why it works?,btohqsg
Do you know why this doesnt work ?,btohqsg
It's because when anyone copies and paste it and submits it to their instructor  then theyobviously get it wrong,btohqsg
I find that a lot more important for a question like this,btohqsg
At least I don't have to start emailing instructors 'oh I didn't know they were going to copy paste code',btohqsg
Just copy and paste it if you want,btohqsg
I dont think u seem to get my point. Perhaps someone else could explain it to you better. Imma go back to reading :),btohqsg
Well in python you can always just do:list(set(myList)Else you may want to do something like this psudocode:newList = []for element in myList do:if element not in newList:newList add element,btohqsg
do note that the order of the elements isn't retained in the first solution but retained in the second,btohqsg
If we're including other languages we should use the mother of them all:Rcpp::cppFunction('std::vector<int> MyFunc(std::vector<int> u) {std::vector<int> v;for(int i = 0; i < u.size(); i++){if (std::find(v.begin()  v.end()  u[i]) == v.end())v.push_back(u[i]);}return v;}')MyFunc(c(2 2 3 1 1 0)),btohqsg
Later instructor complain why need Rtools,btohqsg
Any tips for o level combined science,btohqsg
QA just memorise what plus what does what eg. acid and metal will give u salt and h2. so u can immediately say oh magnesium and sulfuric acid=magnesium sulfate. QA just memorise and do those flowchart qns,btohqsg
if practical easier. memorise the format that u supp to put ur answers in,btohqsg
like again i use acid and metal,btohqsg

cos practical u can get away with it,btohqsg
yeps. u must describe the test. for colour change must say change from what colour to what (eg. green to reddish brown for iron),btohqsg

Just read it out and see if the sentence is sensible,btohqsg
Sanity checks like this should be able to get at least 7,btohqsg
