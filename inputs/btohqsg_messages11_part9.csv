Nono not your fault either hahahahaha,btohqsg
I'm praying that it's just like a general form prompt,btohqsg
If not  it's really inconvenient and expensive,btohqsg
Quite unfair also  to have to pay extra to get pregnant hahahaha,btohqsg
ohh so how do they asses our grant amount? when we present all our payslips during first appt?,btohqsg
do they definitely disburse the grants before the 2nd appt where we need to pay the downpayment?,btohqsg
Yes confirm 2 wks b4 ur signing of lease,btohqsg
im just hoping to secure a unit by this yr to take advantage of the higher amt of grants i can get  now w every launch i miss  the lesser grants i get  haha,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know how long will it take for the grant to be approved? I have been waiting for about 6 months since I paid the option fee,btohqsg
6 to 9 mths or longer,btohqsg
Uh the grant means etcMy partner ($3000) +  Me ($2500) = $5500   so $5500 divide by 2 ?,btohqsg
Just a example. Anybody can guide me along,btohqsg
the grant they give you depends on your gross monthly household income (you and your partner) over the past 12 months prior to the month of the sales launch that you applied for,btohqsg
so its not necessarily your income. for example  someone who just started working maybe 1 or 2 mths will get more grants even if their income by right get lesser grants.,btohqsg
So the grant = A+B get the total then divided by 2?,btohqsg
Since we both working for more than 4years,btohqsg
should be the average of the past 12 months to the point of application,btohqsg
the more accurate formula is your past 12 mths of income + your partner's past 12 mths of income  then divide by 12,btohqsg
eh no. cos if one of you worked less than 12 months  they don't take the average of the 12 months,btohqsg
it's average of the working months,btohqsg
Hmm so mostly it’s count 12 months ah,btohqsg
Hmm so whatever it is  they wont take A + B divide by 2 ya,btohqsg
no. it is never divided by pax,btohqsg
Can check to apply grants only it’s during unit selection?,btohqsg
no  cos it's not always divided by 12,btohqsg
when one party has not worked for 12 months  then their income is divided by the number of working months,btohqsg
Grant also include working occupier meh ?,btohqsg
Or just the main Owner and co owner only ?,btohqsg
Only main applicant n co applicant,btohqsg
great  im getting way lesser grants than i thought  haha,btohqsg
Can i know how come when submitting bto $10 balloting need to include occupier payslip ? But for applying grant just nice co applicant + co owner,btohqsg
so what if Mr A salary is not fixed,btohqsg
put together a guide  hope this helps,btohqsg
Here stated included in the occupier also though.,btohqsg
Oops my mistake.wat I mean was if main applicant + occupier u cannot use occupier cpf to pay for flat,btohqsg
Yes average of past 12 months. I got slightly higher bcos my spouse worked 10 months prior to application. So when the grant come out to be a bit higher than what I expected  I quite surprised. I called in to find out how they calculate.,btohqsg
yes  12 most of the time. but see here for an example as to why it's not always 12,btohqsg
this is the most all-encompassing formula,btohqsg
Then I won’t get grants alr :( is it,btohqsg
So if A & B add up it’s 8k X 12 months then divide 2 it’s alr 8k?,btohqsg
you mean both A and B have worked for 12 months  and every month total is 8k? then it's 8k,btohqsg
never never divide by the no of pax,btohqsg
ya as long as below $9k confirm got grant just a matter of how much,btohqsg
Cos sometime we both earn over $9 idk how hdb assets,btohqsg
for the longest time i thot i was gna get like $65-70k  but end up is $40k  haha,btohqsg
my bf just started working bk in aug. ive been working for 2+ yrs alr.,btohqsg
My range only this 2 leh so less meh ?,btohqsg
I might as well don’t take right if next time want buy bto again need pay levy,btohqsg
so once his income is taken into account  theres that jump from 70k to 40k  haha,btohqsg
just take. once you buy bto it's alr considered taking subsidy. need to pay levy regardless,btohqsg
