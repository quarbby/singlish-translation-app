I nvr hear ppl have geog tuition,btohqsg
She say shes gonna need tuition for both so might as well take econs,btohqsg
but econs is like 50% theory 50% application,btohqsg
Geog also got q abit of applications tho,btohqsg
How is that relevant to my comment,btohqsg
the theory part can score one but the application is like gg,btohqsg
econs the diversity of answers are wild,btohqsg
It's rly abt the question dissection,btohqsg
I'm saying this for both geog n econs,btohqsg
like even with the ans sheet i still dk how to allocate marks,btohqsg
The qns techniques R more standard,btohqsg
Maybe it's cuz it's my h1,btohqsg
Idk how wack they can get at H2,btohqsg
ya h2 econs feels more worth,btohqsg
Cuz wthell is up w the MNC bullshit,btohqsg
Geog or econs essay I couldn't even tell when my friend show me what they doing bruh,btohqsg
Like right I feel the main diff for econs between H1 n H2 is the,btohqsg
For geog is more the content,btohqsg
Cuz both H1 and H2 got essay and drq,btohqsg
for h1 econs they just remove the essay and add 20 marks to the passage based thing  not worth,btohqsg
I mean the fact that TM basically print almost the exact same,btohqsg
Notes for both H1 and hw,btohqsg
And just slap some stuff as,btohqsg
Ya that's y ik the diff betw H1 and H2 decently well I think?,btohqsg
bro i find hist more bearable  maybe it's just passion,btohqsg
The depth of content for answering that one I not sure alrd,btohqsg
content wise i think less by 3 chapters,btohqsg
Market structure is low-key fucked but,btohqsg
but i think with the new 70rp system the number of econs takers will drop,btohqsg
cos now i see more ppl taking ell/geog/tsd,btohqsg
