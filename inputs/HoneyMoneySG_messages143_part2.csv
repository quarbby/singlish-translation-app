Hi all! Wish to ask if DBS Yuu have excluded Foodpanda as their partner?I'm not getting the base 10x points for my last 5 transactions using DBS Yuu card. The awarding was 1x point upon purchase  followed by another 1x point few days later (which should be 9x instead).Anyone have the same issue? Thanks! ü§ó,btohqsg

So it will be 1 Dec (Sunday) for the coming month? Thanks a lot!,btohqsg

Hi all  I need to post another $450 worth by the end of month to hit my uob one bonus interest for the month (due to car rental deposit return - I just found out the target to hit this month is 1k+)Does anyone know if buying capitastar vouchers can post within the same day or by next day? Or does anyone have an alternative suggestion for me to quickly post $450 either within the same day or next day?,btohqsg
no 1% or 1.5% if under your selected category. Using Trust cashbscack card (not trust link card)?,btohqsg
yea. Note that it will be dated 2 Dec but still better than say transfer end of month instead,btohqsg
You need to be an admin to do this.,btohqsg

Okay. Mine must be a link card. Crap. But I actually got cashback in September lol. Thanks a lot people!,btohqsg

It's $1.88 cashback on 125.15 spending. It looks like 1.5%,btohqsg
lol so strange if u did not have Trust cashback card,btohqsg
Yah it's really strange! Maybe it's a bug in their system or maybe it was because I didn't link to the fair price group app previously or idk what's the reason,btohqsg
How much should i put into my spy each month,btohqsg
