Don’t think you need to add amaze here,btohqsg
Meaning will get 4mpd even charge direct?,btohqsg
When will Uob$ appear in the app?,btohqsg
Made via website so i guess its it rather than via mobile app,btohqsg
The TnC document of the promotion have a list of all excluded transactions. Capitaland vouchers confirm don't count. Giant vouchers you can try buy together with some other items and double check if get any yuu points. If get  then high chance it's counted as valid spend. Although i suggest better not to since vouchers are listed as exclusion. If you have singtel bills to pay  can pay at singtel self service kiosks at singtel physical shops.,btohqsg
Confirm can get 4mpd with crmc direct. No need to link with amaze.,btohqsg
I used to see the cashback reflected immediately in PayLah! app but now it isn’t so I thought apply pay doesn’t qualify,btohqsg
From internet banking. Can also see the total cashback amount in PayLah app.,btohqsg
Hi is it normal if topping up medisave  the amount shows up on medisave but the tax relief on retirement tab did not show up yet?,btohqsg
if i already have another citi card is it still worth it to get the citi rewards card to go the amaze route,btohqsg
Applied UOB credit card using onkine form as I'm foreigner. Have been almost 3 weeks still nothing :(,btohqsg
if most transactions fall under crmc+amaze  what do you guys use to fill up the gaps? for public transport and travel spend,btohqsg
public transport use SC smart no min spend no annual fee. Sign up rewards on money smart/singsaverTravel spend use HSBC revo (up to 1k) or DBS WWMC (up to 2k),btohqsg
Anyone know when is the monthly cut off date for POSB cashback bonus?For the earn programme,btohqsg
what about spending in a foreign country? like if im going overseas on holiday and spend thru a card,btohqsg
Only spend thru the card lor for things like airlines and hotelFor dining so long as it’s not cafe in hotels  CRMC + amaze still works cos overseas dining merchant code still the same as local. Retail merchants also still the same mahAlmost all bases covered alrd mah,btohqsg
oh ok thnaks so much. so travel is specifically things like tickets and hotels ah,btohqsg
Have been waiting for 3 months and I'm local AND i already have a UOB CC. Go figure  haha,btohqsg
I'm planning to use Amaza CRMC conbo for overseas travel  specifically on shopping and dining. However  I'm not sure what to use for hotel payment (I'll be paying at hotel). Trust Card perhaps. HSBC Revolution limit is 1k so not enough,btohqsg
I thought locals can get them with MyInfo in less than a day? 👀,btohqsg
No. So I can't apply through MyInfo. Need fill online form.,btohqsg
Anyone applying giro to pay citibank cc here? Wanna ask is this the correct form to fillhttps://www.citibank.com.sg/global_docs/prod/cc_giro.pdf? Also anyone can help me to see what should I fill for thebranchand should I fill in theFor Official Usesection as well. Thankss 🙏,btohqsg
branch just put the first 3 digits of your giro bank account. for official use is for the bank staff to fill you can leave it blank,btohqsg
also sharing a tip to save on postage fee: google the business reply form --> download it print it out and follow the instructions of mailing. as long as the address on the BRE matches the address they tell you to mail to on the giro form then you are good to go.,btohqsg
Anyone knows if ipaymy/ cardup is considered eligible spend for the new SC Journey card?,btohqsg
How about if starhub bills? Will it count since excluded is utility bills?,btohqsg
I waited 3 months for mine to get approved. Singaporean here,btohqsg
Should count as valid spend but will not get all the extra yuu points,btohqsg
Open a usd cheque account. Internal transfer from your multicurrency account within same bank is free. After that issue cheque from your usd cheque account to another bank in Singapore which is also FREE.If you use TT method then it's expensive.,btohqsg
Question to the Mile Enthusiasts here who have the UOB One Account  how do you segregate your expenses in the UOB cards to fulfil the minimum spend of $500 while ensuring you don't lose out on the potential miles,btohqsg
But do take note usd cheque account may need to maintain min balance and varies from bank to bank. Of course nothing stopping you from opening the account  issue the cheque and close it.,btohqsg
Please also take note of the minimum balance imposed. If you operate too many bank a/c  then u need to fulfil min balance for all of them.,btohqsg
So my USD in the corporate OCBC USD account. I need to open a personal OCBC USD cheque account? Then from there I can issue cheque for my DBS account or can directly pay from my personal USD?The reason is I transact in USD  and this corporate account only receives  it's not linked to the debit card  I cannot use it nor I can send it to my Wise account,btohqsg
Does tapping UOB one card at bus / mrt gantry contribute to cashback?,btohqsg
Yes. SimplyGo gives additional cashback too,btohqsg
Hi all  i scheduled GIRO deduction with EGA for my AMEX TCB. Today is the statement due date but still havent deduct! I abit scared will kena late penalty fees! Any idea why?Ps i got confirmation from HSBC that GIRO was setup,btohqsg
What about taka vouchers? New sign up for dbs yuu amex.,btohqsg
Personally dont see why buy taka voucher when there is dbs taka card. U can try ntuc or other grocery voucher.,btohqsg
Buying taka vouchers for fren's house warming gift. So will charge to new cards  either yuu card or Citi cashback to clock the min spending... is Citi cashback better? I dun have dbs taka...,btohqsg
If that is the reason then can just buy taka voucher,btohqsg
Unless the counter terminal mcc is excluded. Although i think should not be,btohqsg
Amaze extended 4x to 30 June,btohqsg
GIRO setup completed does not mean your current bill will be paid via GIRO. It depends on when the bill is generated  before or after GIRO setup.To know if your bill will be auto paid via GIRO. Check your bill  there should have a word or sentence printed on the bill to indicate it is to be paid via GIRO.If your bill is generated before giro setup with due date after giro setup  this bill will not be paid via giro.,btohqsg
If there is no GIRO indicated on the bill  you better quickly pay manually to avoid late payment charges.,btohqsg
Coming to think of it  just a suggestion this CBS might be a good topic for the next video for@ChrisHMSGsince so many pple have queries on it and is unsure how the banks use them and how pple can build/improve their own credit rating,btohqsg
Thank you so much advice! Will faster make payment now and wait for next month,btohqsg
Does your Amex TCB bill has this printed on the bill?,btohqsg
Hi guys  any good use cases for the standard chartered manhattan card?,btohqsg
If your USD is in corporate OCBC USD  you would already have cheque facility right? you can just issue the cheque from OCBC corporate account to your DBS account. In short  USD cheque is free. TT is chargeable.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for HSBC revolution card  does the 4mpd applies for contactless payments but not under the MCC codes that qualify (e.g. car repairs)?,btohqsg
