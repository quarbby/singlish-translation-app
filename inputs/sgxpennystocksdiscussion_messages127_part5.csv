Ug target meet . Upgrade . Then meet upgrade again,btohqsg
But the pe was Low. That time I thinking why set such a Low pe. Now I know why. Bec they can slowly eat slowly up the price and pe .,btohqsg
I was distracted by the tp figure,btohqsg
Tat time the target price is $1.60,btohqsg
Higher target price but still drop and fall sick again,btohqsg
3yrs ago they intro me.. That time still gorenging ezion,btohqsg
now most imptly JT can be profitable for consecutive quarters to instill more confidence,btohqsg
now most imptly JT can be profitable for consecutive quarters to instill more confidence,btohqsg
Competitor toh means so much to JT.. Really golden era now.. If sell early will end up buy expensive later on.. I will hold another 3mths to see ba,btohqsg
China sunshine lousy isit? JT fly sunshine no fly,btohqsg
Be patience EPF just increase their holding,btohqsg
Guys next week stocks to look  isdn and cnmc,btohqsg
ISDN wait for it burst past 405,btohqsg
Medicals very weak now leh.. mt go up also come down,btohqsg
Im hoping for hosen to finally break past 65 resistance,btohqsg
I'm waiting for zhongxin to break thru,btohqsg
At current price sunshine chemical pe is 10,btohqsg
JT pe is 5 at $0.16,btohqsg
Medicals are v weak now compared to the start as vaccine news spread  the medicals suffer,btohqsg
They said need one news of vaccines,btohqsg
this is accounted infections and deaths,btohqsg
we do not assume unaccounted ones first (surely there is overaccounted and unaccounted),btohqsg
cut out the noiseno need see infected,btohqsg
just check deaths and serious cases (probably icu type),btohqsg
serious cases are growing slower but deaths are moving higher daily,btohqsg
using the logic  like water leak and water flow,btohqsg
the flow = serious casesleak = deaths,btohqsg
no doubt on surface flow seem to have slowed but it is due to leak becoming bigger,btohqsg
if you reversed the trend and stare at the figuresactually both are increasing at very alarming ratesit is just relative only,btohqsg
I just see if US next week will hit how high to gauge,btohqsg
why put serious cases and deaths together?simply because serious cases higher risk of deaths,btohqsg
if move back wards the deaths into serious casesyou will see how much actually the serious cases have increased,btohqsg
and this is very alarmingnot just a US problem,btohqsg
Since election + protest + uncontrolled spread = recipe for disaster,btohqsg
Hmm anyway the way I see it is lockdowns are being put to anticipate further spikes,btohqsg
So it is still pretty serious threat even now,btohqsg
and it is going to hurt the economy morebut uncle may be wrong lavaccine or notit is not important,btohqsg
because vaccine is not = treatment.currently treatment is mixed of treatments as covid hits different body functions differently and mainly is use steroids,btohqsg
Many other counters to play with.,btohqsg
Can I check which sector is Sunrise in?,btohqsg
Still trading above the uptrend line. I think just wait . Market looks to be better. And buyers came in strong 40   41 yesterday. Chance still there,btohqsg
i trying to load cannot reach leh,btohqsg
i went bloomberg to find the webpage,btohqsg
oh i see. just now i also got see this webpage but i thought is different company because of the pte ltd.,btohqsg
Anyone vested on sarine tech? Any vision?,btohqsg
i think the ITE Electric System Co. Pte Ltd not part of their holdings le based on their last year conpany report,btohqsg
honestly speaking it is kind of unclear to me what they are selling. i see in their 2019 FY report their revenue now is solely based on property consultancy and management. i will suggest that if you want trade in a very short term but dont long ba.,btohqsg
