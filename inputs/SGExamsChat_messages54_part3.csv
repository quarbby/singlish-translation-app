Hello SGExammists  this is an official informal message,btohqsg
MOE is looking for students to share their HBL experiences and how they’re coping  and relevant humourous things to say. Got to be ok with having your face and name public. Anyone interested?,btohqsg
Same BAHAHA but on my own I'll try to eat vegetarian/vegan food as much as I can,btohqsg
That’s one of the actual bullet points,btohqsg
gib honest review to MOE... 1 out of 5 stars,btohqsg
Well  they didn’t say that you can’t share negative opinions,btohqsg
invalid link. if you want to share your notes  you can upload them onexams.sg/library,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionare you planning to get the switch,btohqsg
There aren’t really any interesting things on it for me  other than smash,btohqsg
Little did you know John Smith is a furry,btohqsg
I just built nook's cranny lol,btohqsg
my progress in the game is damn slow,btohqsg
once you get the town hall  things will begin to change,btohqsg
imagine being able to use ur switch,btohqsg
did you start playing cause i intro it,btohqsg
I had it in mind for awhile,btohqsg
Wah u want expose ur identity arh,btohqsg
Doesnt sound like itll be that beneficial for portfolio either,btohqsg
You got to be comfortable having ur face and name online,btohqsg
“contributed critical analysis on HBL structural framework and execution that led to direct change in MOE’s policies on online learning,btohqsg
Hmm sounds good but lemme think if its worth,btohqsg
Is there like a deadline for it,btohqsg
hahaha anything is good if you know how to smoke,btohqsg
Although it’s best to decide fast,btohqsg
I’ll let the relevant people know,btohqsg
And then they’ll contact you or something,btohqsg
I know this is uncomfortable  but what often happens is people who have good things to say volunteer  then say good things and things don't get better. The people who have real concerns and issues don't want to volunteer  the MOE think they're doing a good job and nothing changes.If you feel like you don't have good things to say  I would encourage you with the perspective that this may be one way to actually make things better.,btohqsg
LOL hi moe should check out my HBL vlog =),btohqsg
Vlog is a bannable offence in sgexams,btohqsg
According to section 7(1) of sgexams constituition,btohqsg
I want you to fuck up my nights,btohqsg
I think they’re looking more for people to use their comments and image to make their own social media posts,btohqsg
Sad u havnt saved my contact,btohqsg
who knows  maybe MOE may feature your vlog!!!!,btohqsg
“Not that online meetings mean less  but they’re just not the same.”8 recovering addicts tell CNA Insider of their challenges to stay clean as they go without physical counselling and group sessions during Singapore’s “circuit breaker” period.https://cna.asia/2xzwz2R,btohqsg
As in  they want to use your image and comments to make their own social media post  and if you’re fine with that you can volunteer to do so,btohqsg
Not sure if this is any clearer,btohqsg
But u can check out their Instagram for examples of what they probably want to do,btohqsg
