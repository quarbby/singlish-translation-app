Funny new measures from MOH.No cordoned off coffee shops allowed 5 vaccinated peoples to dine in same table from 5pm to 10.30pm lol,btohqsg
Should just do it any hr for 5  why 5pm to 10.30pm,btohqsg
Talented MOH very funny to choose hrs lol,btohqsg
They purposely choose 5pm to 10.30pm.  Dinner time  shopping time  dating time  gathering time. More easy to tio n spread. Anyway this omicron not so deadly at all. Just normal flu n cough. Their thinking  tio n get over with it. Make you scare  so 100% jab. And 100% booster. Than open up directly. No need to explain to anyone. Open up. Money come in. That's it.,btohqsg
Just doing extra to justify their bloated salaries... This goes to show how out of touch these people are from the ground... As if the virus spreading will be lesser if just open 5pm to 1030pm,btohqsg
That is a clown face. You see the mouth. Really look like a clown mouth.,btohqsg
Really funny! Want to relax measure then just relax  what 5pm to 10.30pm you think coffee shops very free ar!,btohqsg
Just see how close people are standing and talking inside the buses and trains... Yet still insist on these additional restrictions.,btohqsg
I recall the first community explosion started from bus captains?,btohqsg
Have to wait until sufficient jab stocks are utilized or donated,btohqsg
Or else cannot expect these senseless restrictions to end,btohqsg
Any opinion on SIA shares? Good to buy now?,btohqsg

May be the coffee shops don't provide enough tax or GST revenue?,btohqsg
