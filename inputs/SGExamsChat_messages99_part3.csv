We did the NUS prof lecture at NYJC,btohqsg
And the NIE guy was at my school,btohqsg
I remember even CJC made it here,btohqsg
NJC was also part of the NYJC one,btohqsg

If it’s based on geographical proximity  CJC is pretty east,btohqsg
Yes I think that’s what I meant,btohqsg
Then NJC is way more west,btohqsg
But ok that makes more sense,btohqsg
The 2nd set of lectures was a big L coz only the legit east side JCs come to TJC,btohqsg
And yea VJC does their own lessons,btohqsg
Oh wait its at the mjc building,btohqsg
We always suspected HCI and RI weren’t there cause they had their own stuff too  but we didn’t have confirmation,btohqsg
Even if it’s at the TPJC one it’s Tampines,btohqsg
And it’s part of Tampines east MRT,btohqsg
Icic i have never left the comfort of sengkang so idk,btohqsg
But VJC was confirmed to do it on their own anyways,btohqsg
Jurong east is literally west haha,btohqsg
They had to split it east and west coz too big I guess,btohqsg
Or they just ran out of names,btohqsg
But i dont have a car to learn,btohqsg
Any place with Bukit is west alr,btohqsg
I only know bukits in the west,btohqsg
But do they have the batoks,btohqsg
Central-ish but like who tf cares whether central,btohqsg

Its in an area that isnt real,btohqsg
In other news  a giant hole with 50km radius has appeared in the middle of Singapore,btohqsg
I accepted CS+math double major for NTU,btohqsg
Not intending to change any more?,btohqsg
See whether NUS wants to even give me CS,btohqsg
This year CS a bit fucked,btohqsg

CS bandwagon going ahead at full speed,btohqsg
So CS is almost med/law calibre just that no interview required,btohqsg
My 80 rp friend got rejected from all the courses at NTU,btohqsg
