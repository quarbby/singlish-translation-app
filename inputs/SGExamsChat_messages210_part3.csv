But it was cos of careless mistakes,btohqsg
How little biological sciences actually matter,btohqsg
imagine one day u in coffeeshop and then some auntie collapse,btohqsg
I need an irl example for my goddamn lindelmann hinshelwood mechanism,btohqsg
At least thermodynamics more applicable along with a little bio knowledge,btohqsg
All NUS Chem students need to take that mod,btohqsg
Bio was mever meant to be a standalone subject it was suppsoed to be a complementary one,btohqsg
At least im dominating in my chem exams,btohqsg
To compensate for my math mod,btohqsg
Some of my mods close book,btohqsg
NUS usually is only ard 25%,btohqsg
Aku dominatin physics mod this sem also,btohqsg
Aku tak phy bg u at least got study for bmat level,btohqsg
HAHAHAH i starting w sec sch physics,btohqsg
Can just straightaway start jc physics,btohqsg
Bmat physics is only 15% of o lvl physics,btohqsg
Ya sia i only touched true physics this sem,btohqsg
Last time i touch real physics was sec 2,btohqsg
Wait till u do the one for math majors,btohqsg
if he take sci no need,btohqsg
but go kee siao ppl go take the pure math ma1102r mod and branch out from there,btohqsg
then 4 yrs later see them in JPMorgan,btohqsg
So far i only done till circular motions,btohqsg
lol i dont even know whats that,btohqsg
my mind has alr been stretched in thermodynamics and kinetics,btohqsg
Wait why u learning phy arh,btohqsg
Meanwhile I am in NS  waiting to take a Physics course,btohqsg
I did bio for 6 yrs of my life,btohqsg
Just to enter a bio course thats 70% phycis,btohqsg
My course the kinetics much more cancer,btohqsg
Got membrane potential all to consider,btohqsg
Can easily finish ur h2 phy syllabus within ns,btohqsg
My tl xiao on i no time study hahaha,btohqsg
Never ask ur tl from what course,btohqsg
Anyone went for ntu h3 molecular biology  has anything to say abt it?,btohqsg
What is big deal abt ma1102r ?,btohqsg
lookin back i rather take that also,btohqsg
@SecrethahaIs that the one you went for,btohqsg
U don't even need to attend lecture haha,btohqsg
is it super difficult to understand>,btohqsg
Just memorise past year Exam paper,btohqsg
and how are the lab sessions,btohqsg
For me it was easy  but could be tough if udh the interest to begin with,btohqsg
Very simple one  anyone can do it,btohqsg
Cos many didn't write report before,btohqsg
the results for it out alr?,btohqsg
ah maybe that will give u an idea,btohqsg
since that mod is bell curved,btohqsg
Now i can use meh too,btohqsg
But does anybody here know how pt job applicants are shortlisted,btohqsg
