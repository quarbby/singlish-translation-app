Goes from Executive to Senior Executive to Manager to VP to CEO then to Board,btohqsg
By then probably other people has implemented what I want to do,btohqsg
I think I shall consider other supermarket giants in SG,btohqsg
It's actually even more funny for some enterprises,btohqsg
Cuz the other peripheral functions is contracted out to external companies,btohqsg
Well the SG mentality of wanting things to be cheap,btohqsg
So u can have an executive that manages a Supervisor that is incharge of a team of technicians but the Supervisor and technicians not even the same company,btohqsg
Then obv the Supervisor itself might have sub contract out the technicians as well la etc etc,btohqsg
Kena complain legit just push the blame,btohqsg
Yea I know what's going on,btohqsg
Its going to be a culture shock once I return to Singapore to work,btohqsg
Lmao only thing I can say is good about SG is food,btohqsg
Hmm working in SG will be an interesting experience,btohqsg
When I return to Singapore to work  I probably have 7 years of experience working in Japan,btohqsg
So while I am a Singaporean and probably have been under the Singapore's working culture,btohqsg
Experiencing after 7 years in Japan is probably an interesting experience,btohqsg
Because the working culture is actually pretty different,btohqsg
I got sianz of singapore office culture in like 1-2 months,btohqsg
That might probably happen to me,btohqsg
Different culture  different ways of doing,btohqsg
Learn to read the air and I should be able to survive,btohqsg
As long as I get paid considered good liao,btohqsg
Yeah that's basically the only reason why like half or more than half the office come to work,btohqsg
Because it pays the bills for me / my family,btohqsg
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU HERE,btohqsg
Lol why I can't be here,btohqsg
When someone discovers discord isn't the only channel,btohqsg
Ok tbf I joined for the fun of it,btohqsg
Bobian my luck not good to have rich parente,btohqsg
So have to go out and make dough,btohqsg
Last time I wish for lavish life. Now all I want is just not to worry about income,btohqsg
That's probably another thing I won't get used to,btohqsg
Because in Japan  we are probably pretty professional and serious in what we are doing,btohqsg
Honestly what is the working life like in jpn,btohqsg
Then the classic singapore experience after is during a long weekend u partipate in the Causeway fun,btohqsg
It might be surprising to you all  but the working hours is not as long as what you all thought out to be,btohqsg
I feel that maybe Singaporeans work longer than Japanese lol,btohqsg
Then Covert your dough into 3.5 more dough and then burn thru that in 5 days come back,btohqsg
Of course there are outliers la,btohqsg
What's Japan work hrs like tho,btohqsg
Japanese companies probably have more team bonding events like the drinking sessions and all,btohqsg
I worked on a 7 hours and 45 minutes contract before,btohqsg
Currently mine is 7 hours but I usually OT for one more hour,btohqsg
Name's Valerie nicr to meet u,btohqsg
There's the classic 9-5 but also tbh 8-6 also quite common even 9-5 most often stay till 6 to clear the work,btohqsg
Because I get the OT pay,btohqsg
Or like today I OT for extra 2.5 hours,btohqsg
What's your progress on those pads lmao,btohqsg
Because I want to clear that initial coding phase otherwise I will forget what I am doing when Monday comes,btohqsg
