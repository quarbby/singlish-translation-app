Hi Chris  I've been revisiting your youtube videos on REITS. It seems their charts (Mapletree Log/Ind/Com  Keppel DC  Parkway) are identical i.e. downtrend towards a potential support. I've yet to invest in REITS and am thinking of using my SRS.,btohqsg
Is there some common event that resulted in this observation? Year-end  dividend payout?,btohqsg
Unless for tax purposes. See no reason at all to invest in Reits. Get a few percentage per year while having downside risk in property market even cpf sa have better risk reward ratio. Of course just my 2 cents. As I never see a investor billionaire invest in Reits before.,btohqsg
Thanks. Where will you park the SRS funds?,btohqsg
Hst [China tech etf] it might have more downside risk. But already quite undervalued overall.,btohqsg

Anyone here have compare s&p 500.Like voo spy splg,btohqsg
SPLG cheaper. More easier to people with lower income to dca,btohqsg
generally I would recommend$SPLG  it's cheaper and thus more flexible,btohqsg
How abt S27 based in singapore,btohqsg
there's some explanation why it's better than$SPY,btohqsg
SPLG may cause many veteran ETF investors to scratch their heads because State Streetâ€™s other S&P 500 fund â€” the S&P 500 ETF Trust  better known by its ticker SPY â€” is the oldest and largest ETF on the market. The 1993 debut of SPY pretty much established the modern ETF industry  and SPY is often touted as one of the most-traded securities on the planet. So why did State Street bother with a clone? There are a few reasons. Like other early ETFs  SPY was structured as a UIT  which means it lacks the flexibility to lend out shares and reinvest dividends. These factors are part of the reason why SPYâ€™s management fee has remained persistently higher than upstart rivals like the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)  which helped those funds swipe market share from SPY. SPLG is State Streetâ€™s answer to that problem. SPYâ€™s higher fee wonâ€™t deter short-term traders  who are more concerned with liquidity than fees  but for buy-and-old investors  SPLG is the better alternative.,btohqsg
VOO or SPLG  not much difference when talking about fractional investing.,btohqsg
Only when you want to buy whole units  then SPLG makes more sense due to lower pricing  can round to more units,btohqsg
