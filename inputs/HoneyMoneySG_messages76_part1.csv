need to earn more miles after the $1k but most 4mpd only cap 1k,btohqsg
hm  electronics mcc no more under bonus mcc  and no more for big item above $1k. Read the latest TnC for ocbc titanium rewards.,btohqsg
yup but among the recent big singsaver promo (cimb  citi  sc) only cimb excludes amaze,btohqsg
hsbc revo is visa  cant link to amaze  only mastercard can be link,btohqsg
I know about hsbc I just make sure that MCC 8021 is an eligible spend . I would like to link it to Citi PremiumMiles card not hsbc,btohqsg
So it mean most likely would be consider as a eligible spend if I link CitiPremier master card into amaze and use amaze to spend on dental clinics,btohqsg
Well from the T&Cs we don't see anywhere that it might be excluded,btohqsg
Cos I using miles card toGet 1 $ 7 miles. HSBC and other card not charging. Only Citibank. And after checking they told me this transaction is made via Agoda HK thus causing this . My hsbc is under Agoda sg,btohqsg
But hsbc is under visa . No charge so far,btohqsg
Hi  can check where can we trade futures for Calf?,btohqsg

CITIfrom the T&Cs don't see anywhere that it might be excluded,btohqsg

So I need to make a payment at the Celson furniture store MCC 5712.Can I confirm that even the UOB Visa Signature card (typically used for FX) is a good one to get 4mpd for a contactless transaction?I have already use up the max benefit of the UOB preferred platinum card (which I got after seeing it here on Honey Money)  so wanted to use a different card provided I get 4mpd.,btohqsg
Hi. Im new to the credit card world. I dont know where to start. Any tips for me? Im looking for a credit card for Transportation & daily use with now minimum spending monthly if possible.,btohqsg
Standard chartered Smart card. No minimum spend,btohqsg
Basically my question is does UOB Visa Signature give 4 mpd on SGD contactless?,btohqsg
Yes. But need min spend $1000 contactless on that statement month.,btohqsg
hi anyone got any experience (or issues) receiving a refund when shopee cancels an order and when the payment was via instarem linked to citi rewards? they lost my parcel and triggered an auto refund but not sure if it's gonna be an issue since payment was made via instarem,btohqsg
generally not an issue  although amaze may reject the refund (merchant usually will retry) and ask you to link to wallet to receive it instead,btohqsg
thanks fish. haha hopefully they wont reject.. üôèüèª,btohqsg

I always get confused by whether Commune for example has an online store but also a physical store  so is it the same MCC?,btohqsg
Third time I called Moomoo  now the TNC change again. current funds must not be withdrawn to bank account  else ineligible for second round promo 5.8%,btohqsg

Hi all  Just signed up for the SCB Smart Card via Singsaver Promo. Need to spend $250 within 30 days.Can someone advise if i were to go McDonalds and buy $250 worth of vouchers  would it be qualified as Eligible and Qualifying transactions for the bonus points and singsaver spending criteria?,btohqsg
Similar to Gpay  cashback is based on luck.1transaction (min SGD$10 / FX equivalent) can only get1chance to get up to $5 (not sure what's the minimum  could be $0  could be $0.01  could be $1).E.g. $9.99 transaction will get 0 chance  $10 transaction will get 1 chance  $100 transaction will also get 1 chance.Cashback will be credited directly to GXS Main Account  and isalso limited by the $75k maximum balance. So if you have over $75  your cashback is instantly $0 for all transactions.Transaction exclusions similar to standard credit/debit card exclusions (i.e. but not limited to  wallet top-ups  wire transfer  charity  gambling) ANDall Grab app related transactions.- It's a MasterCard with 0 FX fees.- Not sure if can pair with Instarem to double dip  might not be worth also.- Currently cannot add to mobile payment wallets (i.e. Gpay  Apple Pay  Samsung Pay).- 1.2x Grab points on Grab app related transactions.,btohqsg
Assuming if they use same payment terminal as u order at counter  it would be eligible,btohqsg
Okay thank you for the clarification. Will try it out :),btohqsg
Didn't ask about that. My plan is to withdraw to bank account to subscribe for upcoming SSB  which has high chance of not being able to get fully subscribed  then I plan to redeposit back to Moomoo.,btohqsg
Honestly the state at launch is quite horrible  unless used for FX transactions.,btohqsg
Refer to Melvyn's msg above  it explains very well,btohqsg
Actually I don't think pairing with amaze is a good idea since it already has 0 fx fees,btohqsg
It's more for the double dipping in InstaPoints AND gxs cashback. Since both also min $10 sgd FX equivalent,btohqsg
Mmm  but think about it  the 2% spread is not worth the 1% instapoint cashback,btohqsg
Who knows.. the $10 can get you $5 cashback.. üåö,btohqsg
think better to pair Amaze with other mastercard for higher sure rebate/points,btohqsg
Hahaha that's why ü§£ honestly the card is a quite a bad card as of the launch state,btohqsg
hi  anyone got experience recommending a forwarder from US to SG? planning to get some tech stuff from amazon US and newegg but some dont ship to SG,btohqsg
ok lah maybe they trying to keep it sustainable  not like the 3.5% which was gone so fast,btohqsg
thank you! i see ezbuy  comegateway and buyandship recommended most often  comgateway seems more ex right,btohqsg
Haha clearly targeted for those who still using gxs bank account..,btohqsg
I see  didn't know that's a trick to get miles from insurance,btohqsg
yeah.I believe ezbuy is currently one of the cheaper US forwarding services if you're looking for cost,btohqsg
