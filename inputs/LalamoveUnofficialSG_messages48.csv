Depressing to see jobs on llm,btohqsg
Alot jobs leh in town area... All waiting for u to take,btohqsg
Go dabao mcd just now for my wife n kid   open gf then receive one order mcd   nahbeh  is my niece which staying beside my block  hahahahaha,btohqsg
How's the llm job situation now? Good jobs or still CMI jobs,btohqsg
Ya my neighbor beside I think they lunch n dinner all grabfood. Sibei rich.. grabfood price include all abt double than if u go buy urself,btohqsg
Last call  i will cancel order today at 12pm,btohqsg
When i can lvl up like the pros,btohqsg
Do like 16 jobs in 6 hours,btohqsg
I do 6 in 3 hours plus already max out liao how possible???,btohqsg
Run up to customer place at least 5mins wait them open door etc,btohqsg
6 customers = 30mins of handing food to them,btohqsg
Picking up also 5mins provided no food delay = 30mins for 6 customers,btohqsg
Assuming all short distance per drive also 10mins +/- ignore weather or traffic   fly mode   1 hour  parking anyhow park also need 3-5mins  make sure take correct order   tts another 30-45mins   like tt 6 orders already near 3 hours,btohqsg
the more relevant metric is average revenue per hour  not jobs per hour  or better  income per week or per month (per person  for team jobs.) Focusing on a number like 16jobs/6hours is very misleading. Burst rate earnings are not sustainable long term; you can work 20hours in a single day for a huge income spike but it's not sustainable.,btohqsg
Wow  good leh  can apply grab car with food ?,btohqsg
And im stuck w an order 🤣😂,btohqsg
Unless u stack 3 orders for 1 hours haha,btohqsg
Then 6 hours got 18 job,btohqsg
Now I stack 2 orders nearby pick up along the drop off I happy liao,btohqsg
But have to camp for AJ cause gone fast sia,btohqsg
My average per hour only abt $16-17,btohqsg
I work like 4 days a week,btohqsg
Weekend only 1 day can work,btohqsg
That aso abt the nett earning of grab driver minus the expense...,btohqsg
Actually i really wanna squeeze more from my available time,btohqsg
But on a serious note  i really dun like to be too late if im handling pple food,btohqsg
Cos i know how it is to having food served cold,btohqsg
Tts why i have so many bags n box,btohqsg

Specially on raining days. Have to avoid going through the painted roads and metallic grills anywhere. Specially on car parks  if turning is best to go straight 1st and go through them with your bike tires before making a corner to avoid skidding due to slippage,btohqsg
That's y rainy days some bikers rather dun wan earn that money. Life mo impt,btohqsg
Ya  morning the gf uncle also say  raining day just go back kunz,btohqsg
Ya lo  how to upgrade to MPV arh? Got MPV job orders?,btohqsg
I kena twice but this time was the old lady driver fault. She inch forward without checking for an oncoming vehicle which is me  as when I get nearer the junction  she stopped her car in the center of the road and I couldn't react on time so lan lan collide onto her.,btohqsg
3 years of riding experience now,btohqsg
how to sign up for MVP,btohqsg
I was going straight in a green light and she was turning right. She never stayed in the right pocket and blindly follows the front car when it proceed to right turn,btohqsg
i see only car bike and van,btohqsg
Guys  better buy the $100 NCD protection,btohqsg
Awaiting for result. I hire lawyer already. HOH at bedok,btohqsg
I think ur suppose to have mpv to sign up,btohqsg
But she told her insurance side it's her fault so ya. Waiting for TP investigation result also,btohqsg
If TP says it's 80% her fault then her insurance company has to pay me than amount add up to my claim,btohqsg
Wah  need lawyer? If her fault  just claim her gao gao  yesterday got one porches p plate  I think so kin na  anyhow jam brake also ,btohqsg
Or i think she has to pay,btohqsg
My one mpv wish leh  but when I apply cs say put under car,btohqsg
Cannot claim gao gao because her insurance officer want to pay me peanuts. Idiot sia. $50 per day for loss of income when I can earn $100 - $300 per day. $300 on weekends doing roo with incentives,btohqsg
Think u must contact llm to change to mpv,btohqsg
Mostly using insurance to pay one  ya good  claim everything  daily pay  hospital bill ,btohqsg
Mine is shuttle ... Quite big space  behind. Aso under car😢,btohqsg
But I think mpv they making it compulsory to paste the sticker,btohqsg
If u don't want paste u will still only see car job,btohqsg
That time I think got come out 1 memo,btohqsg
Yaya  I remember also  I say I don't wan to paste sticker so put me at car only,btohqsg

Beware of taking orders from national gallery ..not under oddle  its from violet onn ..the manager is rude and expect u to deliver by 30mins.Order was late and when he call to ask my whereabouts  i inform him i pick up arrive at 6pm for 610pm order as his staff issue at 630pm.inform him llm sop is 55mins from pick up time.Bey song and give bad ratings,btohqsg
Ah neh manager..pinoy supervisor..msian chinese blur staffs..zzzz..,btohqsg
I help u take revenge tmr.,btohqsg
But most of the time ah  this situation is because they themselves never manage properly. The order already late. So when you come pick up  they very particular and want you deliver ASAP.,btohqsg
They never tell you the order is late already. They just expect you to deliver ASAP.,btohqsg
This is Royal Briyani tactics also,btohqsg
Late and expect you to fly,btohqsg
American club not so bad ar..orders are ready by the time u pick up.Same like cb time..before semi lockdown got to wait like 5-10mins,btohqsg

Saturday I took 1. He expect me to deliver to customer in 15 mins. He say Orchard to River Valley very fast. He say he do Lalamove before so he know. End up the condo have long queue of cars going in and waited to clear customs. Keep calling me to kpkb.,btohqsg
After everything done   he call me say “thank you” because I deliver 40 mins  he kena have to pay for the member order $90. Say I’m best Lalamove driver and hang up on me.,btohqsg
He should send himself since he do b4... N so confident,btohqsg
First weekend of heightened alert. I explained to him he cannot accept. But when I told the customer about it  she understand and say her condo always like this. Many cars. I suspect American club fella make a mistake or prepare order late  so I have to “help” him settle ASAP.,btohqsg
The condo one by one check car and that idiot keep calling and asking. What can I do? Jump queue meh?,btohqsg
Haish..oddle order is the best ..u sent within the time frame bo taichi..,btohqsg
But oodle famous for double book,btohqsg

But the oodle order is tell me go there collect.,btohqsg
The customer also stun. Ask me try if can get race course road to prepare the order. I say not like that one lah. Cannot suka suka change location.,btohqsg
End up cancel order get 50% back,btohqsg
