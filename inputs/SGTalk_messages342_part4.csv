The year is 1984.You have been recruited by the Mad Dogs Force to advise them on the formation of an air force.Their main base is in the north of Myanmar  in RL Kokang and Wa State. To the north and east of them is China with whom they have a neutral relationship  while to the south and west is Myanmar  a hostile country. MDF is friendly with ASEAN  and neutral with both the USSR and USA  but doesn't want to rely on either too much. They're also friends with most of the Burmese ethnic militant groups. They're looking to perform air support for ground operations and air superiority against Myanmar  if possible. They already have small airfields in construction in every decently-sized town within their territory and a midsized airfield in construction in Laukkai and another recently completed in Pangsang.They have a budget of 370 million USD (at their 1984 value) for this  and no capability to build it within their territory as of yet.How would you advise them?,btohqsg

Yooooo so long no see you inside chat le lol,btohqsg
