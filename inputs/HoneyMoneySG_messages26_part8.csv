Ya. Mcc 4121 not in grab car,btohqsg
The best   no bad debt I pay on time,btohqsg
Doubt they will tell reason usually,btohqsg
Try other cards or u must apply 365?,btohqsg
Is a general cashback card of 1.5-1.6% better or 1.2-1.4 mpd card for large purchases like travel etc?,btohqsg
Trying to pair with the 360 account . I haven‚Äôt check the other eligible card for the spend category,btohqsg
Depends on your valuation of a mile. Giving up 1.5% cashback to use a 1.2mpd card means youre buying miles at about 1.2 cents each,btohqsg
I applied ocbc TI it is also qualified,btohqsg
Ok I‚Äôll check that out and try to apply  cause now I‚Äôm only using one CC for all spend   was thinking to get 365 for dining cashback,btohqsg
Understand otherwise have to wait and apply again.,btohqsg
Just wondering if apply via Singsaver  will I entitle for the welcome gift?,btohqsg
This is Citi official offers page  if you sign up from here  you will not be entitled to Singsaver gifts as they are separate promotionshttps://hmsg.link/citicards,btohqsg
What do you generally value a mile at? I read its usually between 0.8 to 1.92 cents,btohqsg
My personal valuation is 1.9 cents,btohqsg
But i know thats on a higher side,btohqsg
Can you share how you arrived at that,btohqsg
A round trip business class ticket to London costs 207k miles. If i take 207k multiply by 1.9 cents  i get about 3.9k. I would be willing to pay 3.9k out of pocket for a round trip business class ticket to London,btohqsg
Has anyone tried transfer funds from your CPFOA to your spouse CPFOA?,btohqsg

Hi Chris do you know if annual fees can be waived for second year onwards or must be paid?,btohqsg

Would this be a good option for non business friends?https://www.americanexpress.com/sg/credit-cards/singapore-airlines-krisflyer-ascend-credit-card/,btohqsg
It's a good card but definitely not a substitute for Highflyer card,btohqsg

Is it more worth it to get uob one debit card or credit card?,btohqsg

I'll talk about it in Highflyer video,btohqsg
So now what is left for GrabPay? Insurance payment? School fees?,btohqsg
No point using grab any more. Can uninstall after 16 Jan.,btohqsg
Will Ah Gong refund the excess?,btohqsg
Well ... I was hoping GrabPay would useful for at least a few more months. Looks like the announcement was timed for the last batch of $5k top-ups. At least it wasn't immediate.,btohqsg
Worth meh  rather keep the money in high interest savings account.,btohqsg
They could have made it immediate on the 16th .... and scores of people would have money stuck in their GrabPay wallets.,btohqsg
you have valid points. Only 1.5% rebate. But money owe Ah Gong needs to be paid eventually. Depends on how much you still owe them,btohqsg
Haha. One thing for sure grab is like digging their own grave. üòÇ,btohqsg
Whats the next card to topup grab after the uob amex berf,btohqsg
this means we can't pay credit card bill and tax through grabpay card lah?,btohqsg
ü•≤wtf. i started to use grab last year  so i literally miss all the benefits of it,btohqsg
Hi all What is the best combo for oversea ?I used to use grab + youtrip.Now a bit lost.I mainly use it for Malaysia petrol and top up tng only.Any advice?Citi reward + amaze?,btohqsg
Yea. Seems like it‚Äôs about time to cancel some cards,btohqsg
