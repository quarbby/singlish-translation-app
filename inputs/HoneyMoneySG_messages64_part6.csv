üëç I was wondering abt this cz I cancelled my ocbc 365 cc 2 months ago after clearing my os balance. The cc was removed in my online banking the next day but I received a call from them today saying I've an outstanding balance of ~$120 partly due to a late charge. And they said my last bill was $802.30 but I paid $771.92. I pointed out there's a posted cash rebate of $30.38 before i made the payment  hence the $771.92 is after deducting the posted rebate. So my qn to the person was if there's an outstanding debt to clear  why am I allow to terminate the card? Anybody knows if I'm allow to use the posted rebate to offset my final bill like in this case?,btohqsg
