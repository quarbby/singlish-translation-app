How to contact hsbc ah? Can go down to the bank? Cause if type in chat very hard to explain,btohqsg
Call up lor or just throw towel,btohqsg
Citi already nerfed supermarkets to 6% recently. Sad,btohqsg
So Iâ€™m not the only one experience this ah,btohqsg
Really?? Oh my didnâ€™t check my rewards statement a/câ€¦ considered to cancel n move on other cc thenâ€¦ ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Already sropoo using it after revolution nerf & clear out points,btohqsg
Ikr. Now my go to are crcm+amaze > dbs wwmc > altitude,btohqsg
But I follow their term and condition very closely and check with heymax for the code lol.  Knn never expect to see the points so littleWas hoping about 9k back in points,btohqsg
Is altitude worth it tho? The only plus point I see about it is that the points dont expire.,btohqsg
Good for lounge access I guess. If u think not worth then don't get.,btohqsg
did u manage to get the American Tourister luggage?,btohqsg
Would dbs wwmc be better in this case? Hahaha just wondering cause my fiance is thinking if should cancel it.,btohqsg
Tbh no except for lounge access. I only may use it for hotel bookings (i compare whats the max point i can earn between altitude or wwmc) and public transport. Too lazy to get different card for orphan miles,btohqsg
Do u mean dbs altitude card?,btohqsg
Cuz wwmc is a good card tbh except its limited to online spending. If covers some offline spending ie  certain mcc  that would make a great card,btohqsg
GG there goes ur 10x points if eligible merchant,btohqsg
Alright thx will check it out for second thoughtsâ€¦ perhaps time to move on ðŸ˜…,btohqsg

Hi everyone~ I'm trying to buy stock from ibkr but I can't buy,btohqsg
Order not accepted. Minimum of 2000 sgd is required in order to purchase on margin  sell shirt  trade currency or future,btohqsg
Question if existing cc under posb everyday card  does applying dbs altitude card consider as new application? If thereâ€™s any promo deal is considered as new customer right? Thx,btohqsg
You got face this issue too?,btohqsg
Didnâ€™t bother check but well itâ€™s ainâ€™t giving much points so far planning to move on other ccâ€¦,btohqsg
Letâ€™s say I want to terminate  should I terminate after I get the rewards from  singsaver?,btohqsg
doed anyone have the maybank evibes card?,btohqsg
Bonus point for May spending will only appear by this month end or next month July.,btohqsg
Same as existing hav Citi Cashback cc   n applying another Citi reward card also counted as existing customer ðŸ¥²?,btohqsg
Do u have money inside IBKR?,btohqsg
But I only started spending in April and got 4000 points for spending 800-900  surely that includes bonus as well right,btohqsg
I would say fulfill the singsaver requirement and get ur gifts first  but do read the fine print just to be sure thereâ€™s any termination clause,btohqsg
so you are trying to fully spend your balance? then you cannot because you will still have to pay for currency exchange (if you have SGD) and brokerage fees etc,btohqsg
Some people did not receive bonus for Aprilâ€™s spending due to rewards system upgrade and was told that it will come in by June. You can call in and check.,btohqsg
Ok noted. So right now itâ€™s best I just tele the points on excel and double check the points in later months?,btohqsg
when you try to place order  you can see a breakdown. what interface are you using?,btohqsg
How did you confirm that saizeriya is 5812?,btohqsg
You do know heymax is not entirely accurate right?,btohqsg
Actually I think some sai are classified as 5814.,btohqsg
Yeap but sai is a restaurant I think,btohqsg
Okay I got it already. Thank you~,btohqsg
You searched on Heymax or link your HSBC to the card maximizer?,btohqsg
@LPS1712click on this and it will give you total cost,btohqsg
Thank you I got it already. The interface not very friendly,btohqsg
Both  by searching will give the mcc code which I used to check in the term and condition Also heymax recommended revo since I have that card,btohqsg
that's true but the fills are great and the prices good,btohqsg
A restaurant can be coded as 5814 too. Some people mentioned they went for ramen and it turned out to be 5814https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/204111,btohqsg
Wa piang ehWhy donâ€™t banks just publish the mcc code along side the statement,btohqsg
Maybe you can go work at a bank then implement itBut it could also be that your reward points havenâ€™t been rewarded,btohqsg
That why i always like amaze with crmc now  mcc shown in app,btohqsg
Will look into that after cancelling revo,btohqsg
Itâ€™s for accountability issue. They donâ€™t want to get blamed if the mcc code is given wrongly,btohqsg
