I won’t recommend eight sim for home wifi usage la. Meant for mobile phone in my opinion. See what the tech pros say,btohqsg
Very good for mobile phone usage. Especially can call back Singapore landline when overseasNo experience for home sharing.,btohqsg
Eh no   I just use the roaming,btohqsg
Can i just clarify if I sign up a credit card and just hit the minimum spending for the rewards and afterwards not use the credit card anymore. Then i cancel after the minimum holding period  will my credit score be affected?,btohqsg
I think as long as you have got a credit card they will gave u a open line no matter you use it or not  it should affect your credit scoring. After you cancel it I think it will take some time before the system update back,btohqsg
so its not recommended to just get the card for the rewards and leave it?,btohqsg
Leave it alone then ok I think. I'd be too worry about credit score in Singapore. Use and pay your bills on time then you will be fine.,btohqsg
Hi guys. I took part in DBS cards season of savings promotion where Marriott hotel is under one of the eligible spend but I realised that the MCC is 6513 for the Marriott hotel I stayed in Dubai. Is there any chance to appeal by providing the invoice?,btohqsg
Anyone know the current fcy fee on amaze (MYR if it matters),btohqsg
was just searching up on Amaze for MYR too.. if i use CRMC + Amaze in malaysia  may i ask what will be the overall fees? amaze converts MYR to SGD. Citi would charge 3.25% FCY fee? but because amaze converted it to SGD. i read this (https://www.instarem.com/help-personal/mcc-fees/) but not too sureim thinking of getting trust cashback card as im about to bust my CRMC bonus points this month 😂,btohqsg
You mean the MCC code is 6513. You can try your luck to appeal. But DBS's T&C is very clear that MCC is not under their control,btohqsg
If u use amaze u will bypass CRMC 3.25% and just get charged the amaze fee,btohqsg
Funny I use Maybank f and f direct in jb for food and instead of giving me cb for rinngit use   they overflow my dining cat… any idea why pls ?,btohqsg
Guess I can only try to appeal. It's a little unfair as it's a Marriott hotel. Didn't know their MCC is different,btohqsg
thanks q! i cant quite find the actual fee.. any luck at your end?,btohqsg
I use amaze in JB for the 1st time last week.,btohqsg
Shld be myr cat. Hmmm. If never use Amaze. Not sure why?,btohqsg
I can’t find a way to find the exchange current rate within Amaze  but can only find out by using the card on transactions and anecdotally from other ppl it has been ~2%,btohqsg
Idk if amaze + CRMC is worth it but perhaps since my trust credit card isn’t a cashback card.,btohqsg
not really amaze fee but about 2.1% mark up compared to mastercard exchange rate,btohqsg
Also not very clear on this but do u mind explaining  so in total the cost of using crmc + amaze is just the 2.1% right  no double charge,btohqsg
Hi guys  if my credit card application is unsuccessful after first attempt  should I reapply again? Will it affect anything?,btohqsg
Wait a few weeks then try again. I got rejected for a SCB card when I applied via MoneySmart/SingSaver  then I reapplied 2 weeks later using the app itself and it got approved.,btohqsg
Wait a few days. I recall there’s some auto adjustment  though I don’t know which bucket it will fill first if your MYR spend is one of the 5 cat. Alternatively call up cust svc and they can help you check,btohqsg
Met the income requirement and still got rejected..,btohqsg
How do you apply? When was last time you updated your salary to UOB?Did you hold any uob credit card before last 10 years?Fixed salary or self employed or commission based salary?,btohqsg
What was the sequence? If you spend in MYR first  it will take your dining quota and not your forex quota,btohqsg
which router support 5g speed and sim card?,btohqsg
Alternative to this: tether internet from phone to router. I think many Asus routers support this functionThose more technically inclined: you can flash custom router firmware which supports this function (tomato/dd-wrt),btohqsg
Now broadband really cheap already. Just 20+30 dollar only per month. 😅Still need to save this type of money? Efficiency also matter.,btohqsg
Contract vs no contractSo you really need to compare apples to apples. That means  compare 24 mth vs 24 mth costI think the use case for getting internet is....1. Require more stable connection2. Have a bit more budget3. Use a lot of smart appliances at home that rely on internet connection (e.g. CCTV  washing machine  air purifier)4. Gaming/streaming (requires lower latency,btohqsg
The main advantage of using a SIM as home internet is the flexibility  in addition to the money savingsUsually  you pay more  and you get more flexibility. But in this case it's not true. You pay more  you get better quality/stability/reliability  butnotbetter flexibility,btohqsg
Just get broadband or what. Don't really need to save this type of money. Internet use everyday. Reliability more important.,btohqsg
Anyone got latest youtrip referral code  can give,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
That's for you. You clearly prioritise reliability (and I agree with you that broadband is more reliable)But it doesn't mean there are no pros or you should just ignore the pros of SIM being a home broadband replacement for others...I did it for a while because I was prioritising flexibility/cost,btohqsg
Can I use Citi SMRT card to buy iPhone at Apple Store app?,btohqsg
my broadband is MyRepublic. during peak periods (evening)  the streaming speed to US sites can get throttled. So I need a backup 5G sim card,btohqsg
Hi  I notice nowadays purchases from Taobao CN are coded based on underlying MCC and no longer based on Marketplace MCC..Recently bought a sofa from Taobao CN and unfortunately 5712 (furniture) is not in PPV whitelist.Has anyone successfully appealed to UOB to get the bonus 3.6 mpd? Thanks.,btohqsg
Dont think you have a case here unfortunately. UOB ppv has a specific list for online purchases.,btohqsg
Oh is it.. I was under the impression it used to be like Shopee that codes as Marketplace,btohqsg
