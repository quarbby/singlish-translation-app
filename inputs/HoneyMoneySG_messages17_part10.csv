U also need to give bank specimen signature if you are new to bank,btohqsg
If you canâ€™t wait that long for the card  go to the bank to update your specimen signature  ask them to issue you a uob one debit on the spot and activate it for you.  U have to sign a few forms to cancel the existing one.  Then when your uob debit arrives in the mail  just cut it up and destroy the pin.,btohqsg
Hi all. Need recommendations. Planning to close UOB ONE account and DBS multiplier account. Was holding min balance in recent years. Stopped using uob one CC as the min spend canâ€™t be reached consistently for quarter. Planning to put money in Trust account. Is it good decision or am I making anything wrong here? Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Trust Bank has pretty high base interest rate at 1.5%. If you're between 18-26yo you can consider SC Jumpstart account at 2%,btohqsg
They advertised till Dec. Now suddenly stop,btohqsg
Thanks. Unfortunately Iâ€™m in mid 30s  so no way SC jumpstart. And Iâ€™m eyeing 2.5% trust account since Iâ€™m ntuc member already.,btohqsg
I'm currently trying out the SIF GoSavers account as well  they offer 2.5% pa base interest,btohqsg

Hello! Would like to check on the effective rebate for this payment approach.Supposed Iâ€™m using Citibank Cashback+ cc (1.6%) and then using GPMC (top up via UOB Absolute (1.7%)) to pay for Citibank++ cc bill  does this equal to 3.3% rebate in total?,btohqsg
Hey guys  if there is a purchase of around $2 400  is Citibank cashback plus or POSB everyday card better  in terms of cashback,btohqsg
So far don't have. Still waiting ðŸ˜‚Think they no money to give discount.Now all trying to stay afloat.,btohqsg
there are many better cards for this,btohqsg
I only have these 2 cards,btohqsg
then 1.6% better than 0.3% lor. Should get better cards lah,btohqsg
Citi canâ€™t seem to have the installment plans,btohqsg
installment plan? then 0% rebate for these cards,btohqsg
All installment plan cannot earn cashback / rewards as I know of,btohqsg
Maybe now competition very high or you can call to check with them,btohqsg
Installment as in installment with the merchant,btohqsg
This one seems like those bank installment plan,btohqsg
Cuz I see T&C for those credit cards exclude installment,btohqsg
this one is after you swipe with your credit card then afterwards the bank app will prompt you asking if you want to split it into installments but normally they charge like 3% upfront service fee. Tried that before with my citibank cashback+  got the 1.6% cashback but in the end need pay 3% interest so still lose out for me,btohqsg
From my past experience  they got alot of options ranging from 3  6   12 months. But the longer the period  the higher the service fee %. That time i chose the 3 months option and was 3%. Think the 12 months one was 5%,btohqsg
2 types of IPP  as far as I know...One is u choose the IPP at the point of purchase  where retailers have various IPP with many banks for u to choose.Another is u swipe ur card at the retailer  a lump sum transaction  and the bank of the CC will prompt u to choose their own IPP...,btohqsg
