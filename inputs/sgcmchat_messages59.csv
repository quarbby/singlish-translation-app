u prefer other cars over jdm thats your preference,btohqsg

Nobody look down on anyone liking whatever Japanese cars,btohqsg
Some ppl like nvr See other places got other cars,btohqsg
sorry but by guys who are you referring to,btohqsg
and very honestly i think thats fine too,btohqsg
they don‚Äôt have to follow what you think is the ‚Äòright‚Äô way to appreciate cars ah bro,btohqsg
i say got culture u send this picture what am i suppose to infer,btohqsg
Some ppl act like they have only seen Japanese cars,btohqsg
then what‚Äôs your purpose behind saying it then?,btohqsg
if theres nothing wrong with it,btohqsg
kamikaze & dekotora are underratedeven tho one is... ww2 type beat,btohqsg
Does something have to be wrong for me to say something abt it?,btohqsg
in this context you‚Äôre not making sense ah,btohqsg
so if that‚Äôs not wrong  then i shall infer it‚Äôs a positive message ,btohqsg
No but it‚Äôs always bttr to open up and look at other cultures,btohqsg
these type of msgs infer criticism mah,btohqsg
js be mindful bro have a gd day,btohqsg
dont see anybody looking down on jap cars tbhüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I dun cream I just want a reliable Hiace/NV350 üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
‚ÄúOni small kids cream over jdms‚ÄùWhat can be inferred.Small kids = Not well read and lack the resources to be exposed to other brands of cars.As a fellow car enthusiast  do you appreciate other forms of automobiles from europe?,btohqsg
yes but i cream over jdms as well :),btohqsg
So its not exclusive to jdm right?,btohqsg
so why are you feeling attacked üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt i‚Äôm just saying be mindful to people‚Äôs preferences,btohqsg
Just see people looking up on euros,btohqsg
small kids are allowed to love jdms  they don‚Äôt need to be well read,btohqsg
You need to infer harder on the intetion of the author when he mentioned ‚Äúsmall kids‚Äù,btohqsg
they can catch up in the future when they grow up,btohqsg
what‚Äôs impt is their passion no?,btohqsg
of course  but who is looking down on jdm?,btohqsg
I don't see why you feel attacked,btohqsg
nobody said older ppl are not allowed to appreciate jdm,btohqsg
Unless you are like some small kids who are not well read and get angry when people say euros are nice as well,btohqsg
and whats jdm  many japanese sports cars are not jdm,btohqsg
as mentioned i do not feel attacked hahah,btohqsg
a mercedes one of my friend owned is jdm,btohqsg
man i guess i must brush up on my knowledge of your friend‚Äôs car,btohqsg
many ppl just look at badge and infer incorrectly what is jdm,btohqsg
u need to infer harder üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
i applaud you guys for being so educated about cars ah,btohqsg
do i need to infer sarcasm from this message too?,btohqsg
its good yall can infer correctly just by looking at the badge and car,btohqsg
of course  if you dont look at the car and know whether its jdm then its time to brush up like u mentioned üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
this is my simple message to you from the start but i cldn‚Äôt get it across,btohqsg
well if the sg car community is filled with more of you idt it reflects very nicely üòÖ,btohqsg
or u cld remain ignorant and uneducated. people like me dislike ppl who spread false info whole falsifying information,btohqsg
Well if the other kind of people exist  the whole community is just spreading misinformation and clout chasing aren't they?,btohqsg
There are different preferences  speed over comfort  function over form  exterior looks over interior  Asian over European+American or the inverse of those,btohqsg
Each person got different mix and match preferences.,btohqsg
won‚Äôt entertain any longer ah  as i‚Äôve said respect everyone‚Äôs preferences  there is not only 2 different types of people,btohqsg
ICE over EV  Manual over Auto  etc,btohqsg
Can react to the JDM pictures also if you don't want to type,btohqsg
so i answer alr i get a cookie ah,btohqsg
u want me play your children games but still haven‚Äôt get my message,btohqsg
Everything you think is JDM isn't actually JDM :),btohqsg
Not every Japanese car is a jdm. Lol. These people,btohqsg
hey bro but honestly  how cld i tell wch of those cars were sold in japan than elsewhere,btohqsg
enlighten me through the photos man,btohqsg
But euro and Asia Pacific car,btohqsg
Euro car made for euro market,btohqsg
Japanese car but meant for north American market,btohqsg
its easy to see what you‚Äôre doing here but half of these were 50/50,btohqsg
and u still didnt get my point ah,btohqsg
learn to know if a jap car is sold elsewhere through a photo?,btohqsg
i‚Äôm asking how cld u tell the fd2r in the photo is sold elsewhere üòÇ,btohqsg
thats why i ask u  what is ur definition of jdm,btohqsg
The car was originally meant for,btohqsg
dont waste my time anymore ah bro üôè,btohqsg
the end u win the award for most educated,btohqsg
Older ToyotaE.g. Toyota Harrier  Aristo  CelsiorGlobal market: Lexus RX  GS  LS respectively,btohqsg
It‚Äôs All good bro. That‚Äôs y ppl like u get clowned in the car community anyway,btohqsg
which i answered it is a jdm car,btohqsg
your friend here said its not,btohqsg
"best way to put this is the areas in which FD civics were sold and their relative designsFD civics were sold in 2 different configurations  Hatch & Sedan. Australasia & Europe were designated with the Hatch ver. & APAC/US were sold the Sedan ver. with a Coupe ver. as well""Although the North American and the Asia-Pacific model slightly differ in front and rear styling  they are mechanically identical. The hatchback is available as a three and five-door. Both Si and Type R trim levels continued although the Japanese and European Type R  while sharing the same engine size  are mechanically different. In the United States  an improved  sportier version of the Civic Si 4-door tuned by tunerMugenwas offered  featuring cosmetic alterations and changes to the suspension  wheels  slight exterior differences  and exhaust system. A Canadian-only Acura model received a new nameplate  changing from theAcura ELto theAcura CSX."" ~ wikipedia  8th gen civics (2005)hence there is this dilemma if FD Hatches/coupe designated for the european & australasia market was truly JDM or notJDM stands for Japanese Domestic Market  cars sold in Japan locally by manufacturers. Hence FD Hatches sold in the above markets are technically not JDM cars. Only Asian market cars like ASEAN + JPY region",btohqsg
so yes not ALL civics are JDM in it's essence which also applies for relative cars with the same characteristics,btohqsg
Eg. Accord = Inspire (for JPY/CN reg)Fit = Jazz (Fit used in JPY/S.L/CN/TWN/USDM  Jazz used in relative markets),btohqsg
When did I say that mate,btohqsg
Maybe you wanna point to my message,btohqsg
