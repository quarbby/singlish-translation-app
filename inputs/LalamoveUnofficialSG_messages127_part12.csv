They don't have such arrangement nw so no point. It confuses reader if they are foreigners who are unable to work & doing so illegally,btohqsg
Err. I think DHL does employ foreign delivery logistics workers. Correct me if i am wrong. But they are on employment rules and a basic pay package,btohqsg
There are also small SMC logistics companies who provide foreign workers as riders for delivery companies like Grab also.,btohqsg
Lalamove they don't have such arrangements. The question is when they have an order that no one wants to accept  they try engage other platforms or maybe these small SMC companies. These companies will deploy their foreigners to pickup the order.,btohqsg
companies like DHL or small MNC companies employs their own worker for their own deliveries  that's ok. E.g. designated driver for one particular company and only do delivery for that one company. Gig jobs such as lalamove/grab/food panda are not allowed for foreigners as they do not have such arrangements.  This is to protect the locals livelihood,btohqsg
Normal company arrangements/rules different from gig jobs platform,btohqsg
"Problem is gig economy companies play the game of ""sublet the job"" to other small companies who hire foreigners. GoGo is one example",btohqsg
The moment u sublet a job to these company  u will see foreigner go pickup,btohqsg
First 10mins foc for customers lor. Subsequent 10mins then charges $2 extra. Malls parking only 10mins grace  means confirm kena parking charges. 😑,btohqsg
For van order no waiting fee bcos we r giving 30mins to load items include this shit arrangements,btohqsg
That's why I got 2 orders at the same time,btohqsg
I don't think so   if either recipient or sender let me wait more than 10mins I am able to claim waiting fee,btohqsg
I asked for waiting time last time CS told me that and refused to give me waiting time fee  may be that CS don't know and I got scammed,btohqsg
When reached give a call to cus/rec   after that make sure to SS the call log send cs👍,btohqsg
Would these items and 8 other cartons fit in a 1.7m van? Just cancelled this order,btohqsg
Hi anybody can help me out . My car died at Kallang way. Battery died  anybody with cable can help to jumpstart?,btohqsg
2 bicycles right? Upper Serangoon View? I cancelled earlier 7pm+  customer don't wait wait for me,btohqsg
1.7m van can  all stack together ask customer want or not,btohqsg
HAHAHA correct the guy dw wait for you? U also  1.7 m van?,btohqsg
Cfm customer okay to stack luh but I dw let these people think so long can squeeze in my van means can,btohqsg

Today Little India a lot job but traffic is crazy,btohqsg

Apparently I if you drive car with or without sticker is 16% but I drive MPV is 16% with sticker 18% without,btohqsg

Are you new on llm? If you are  then after a number of jobs they will invite you to get the llm bag( but I'm not entirely sure if they are still giving out though).Once you hv the bag  your rate will be 16% dediction,btohqsg

I think llm should remind client  the dimension for the service they selected. If exceed multiple times since got photo proof  Ban them. So driver won’t get abused 😌Courier order sometimes say need trolley 🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
That’s why irritating idiots siting in the office,btohqsg
Slap their faces then they know,btohqsg
