I think it is ur own decision + now i think 4h2 is just for scholarship purposes since the new system is out of 70,btohqsg
wait ur friend taking 4h2s ah,btohqsg
Do not let others sway ur decisions,btohqsg
Unless i mean uk it is some valid reasoning,btohqsg
I told my bro there is no point in taking 4h2  he wants to take 3h2 1h1  but my parents force him take 4h2,btohqsg
And said ‘u dun talk nonsense  u didnt take 4h2’,btohqsg
ask ur bro to take 4h2 and drop in first sem,btohqsg
But If he takes econs he shld take h2,btohqsg
He is struggling w math and i cant rmb which other subjects,btohqsg
cuz essay can just vomit everything,btohqsg
Neh i dun think it is a good idea,btohqsg
Idk which is good to drop,btohqsg
Wait is ur brother Sec4 or j1,btohqsg
It is a yes and no,btohqsg
Anyways I never regretted not taking econs,btohqsg
Coz my cher did told me that i would hv scored btr if i hv taken h1,btohqsg
u still got ur A anyway,btohqsg
Apparently my old econs cher teaching Ur sch now,btohqsg
Coz case study is way easier to score than essay,btohqsg
I wont know anyway cause I don't take,btohqsg
if not u will do 90 marks case study,btohqsg
I'm still on the camp of H2 econs more worth than h1,btohqsg
I mean my econs cher came to me and told me I would hv scored better in h1 coz i took econs at os and the case study is the similarity,btohqsg
It depends…some ppl really cmi in essays,btohqsg
