Cuz 1 old wanker will come in and take 30 mins with the doctor,btohqsg
Have h talked in this chat bfr or ure new,btohqsg
It's not luck if all of them are like that :/,btohqsg
Rmb last time u always refer polyclinic to poly,btohqsg
And now it‚Äôs the other way,btohqsg
Where bedok is very colorful there,btohqsg
I am the fucker who got muted with u la,btohqsg
Answer was based on 0 knowledge of E120,btohqsg
eh anyone plays honkai star rail here? what's ur thoughts on it,btohqsg
I can tell u that the Exemption letter is green,btohqsg
i feel that its just another genshin,btohqsg
Freaking bedok why u expose me,btohqsg
Actually technically I am but Uni,btohqsg

Looks up and like next patient Bedok... TAN,btohqsg
later after 1st june i go RHMC shiok,btohqsg
So the line doesn't look as long but then it builds,btohqsg
I am pretty sure thay qualifies as a war crime under the geneva convention,btohqsg
Translation:The duty medic is asleep what u wan,btohqsg
Who does that tho like 2am,btohqsg
Did u tell him to bugger off or did you tell him the results,btohqsg
Since when did Saizeriya ever had quality,btohqsg
Ikr Saizeriya is like the macdonalds of western dining,btohqsg
so E120 is an extra old fuck,btohqsg
No idea what the hell is in there but it's food,btohqsg
zj level sort of old fuck,btohqsg
U how old sia kns walao eh,btohqsg
it‚Äôs pretty ironic how I went to shit and I come back to my project to nothing but js my brain full of shit,btohqsg
Actually I have no idea if I am considered old but sure,btohqsg
I not a uni kia until 23:59 today,btohqsg
U mean to refer to ur own msg,btohqsg
Accidentally swipe left cuz I old fuck la,btohqsg
A level in her blood now,btohqsg
Damn I am young enough in both chats to not understand who the fuck is anyone,btohqsg
U year 1 2 or 3?,btohqsg
Cuz I am the poly dropout here ok,btohqsg
So u ORD alr then u enter poly?,btohqsg
U enter using Olevels N or Ite Hnitec,btohqsg
Eh why didn't u just defer instead,btohqsg
then how are u 23 years old,btohqsg
Yeah I tryna do the maths too,btohqsg
Then why didn't u use your As to enter poly?,btohqsg
If u from RP SAS I can help la,btohqsg
it‚Äôs okay we all love our PR KURO PAYING 3K/YEAR ü•∞ü•∞,btohqsg
Oh even better WE LOVE U KURO !!,btohqsg
I dropout 1 day after the deadline now they wan me pay 1.5k,btohqsg
Eh is the guy who always post his bowling score on discord here,btohqsg
Guess not.. what size ball u like to grab bedok?,btohqsg
Actually just realised how that sounds,btohqsg
ee sounds like smt SOMEONE wld say but can‚Äôt get no balls,btohqsg
Is it the ball with 2 hole or 3 hole,btohqsg
How many fingers u put in your ball,btohqsg

even yr pays more attention than u,btohqsg
I don't even have an ig,btohqsg
says the one who spans meme,btohqsg
no u need to see kuro memes,btohqsg
1. brain dead2. js kuro humour,btohqsg
in conclusion it‚Äôs js kuro humour,btohqsg
U gotta make the distinction tho if they are laughing with you or at you.,btohqsg
What is the age range for that,btohqsg
r drops out of nbs due to peer pressure (by pocoyo),btohqsg
That's a very wide range lol,btohqsg
oki good dn see ur face,btohqsg
I'll find u in the hall,btohqsg
pls don‚Äôt you‚Äôll walk in to the most horrific thing you‚Äôve seen in ur life,btohqsg
I never said I will do so,btohqsg
Like yourself jokes kuro is L,btohqsg
lowk glad he doesn‚Äôt get hoes,btohqsg
He can't be.. he ain't in NUS,btohqsg
Yes I am familiar with that concept,btohqsg
oh my for the love of god,btohqsg
I don't save names I just keep everything as the og number,btohqsg
where‚Äôs the pocoyo who I put the gun at his head,btohqsg
I‚Äôm pretty sure I gave him $5,btohqsg
And come inside our media studio,btohqsg
kuro I dare u come my sch dressed as a sec sch kid,btohqsg
And pretend to open house yourself,btohqsg
Bruh I supposed go back take cert,btohqsg
Be a good alumni and come back,btohqsg
bruh I waned go back kacau,btohqsg
i think my system commited suicide,btohqsg
Can try sim lim cuz u need it instantly,btohqsg
is a sign to buy a new one,btohqsg
üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
Bruh that one I cannot help u liao,btohqsg
what sort of help u need?,btohqsg
actually none ah I js lazy,btohqsg
I see then slp with the üõù,btohqsg
which gives them free marks for portfolio,btohqsg
but it‚Äôs js the sch pushing them,btohqsg
At least in NP u have notes.,btohqsg
time I sign on is it,btohqsg
ya lor. calling me bck in Dec,btohqsg
how is the vid i sent,btohqsg
I clearing 2nd cycle alr in NSC,btohqsg
the transition for ppt i sent,btohqsg
I only have 5 mins so nah,btohqsg
I‚Äôm js gg use preset transition and template,btohqsg
It's just ppl who got rejected from NP and SP biomed basically,btohqsg
I got my eae offer revoked for pharm sci,btohqsg
As I S for H1 maths,btohqsg
Pull my RP from 79 to 72,btohqsg
I H1 S... like that was my only fault,btohqsg
Bruh H2 D still OK what,btohqsg
hehe my gpa drop this sem i gon die prob,btohqsg
Hmm I don't really wanna repeat my education pathway too cuz its gonna take too long,btohqsg
It will get worse in Sem 2,btohqsg
i feel like its a combination or alot of stuff,btohqsg
I suffered through Y2 just to give it all up cuz MOE is an asshole,btohqsg
2 i hate what im studying,btohqsg
so im just forcing myself to study,btohqsg
I just look a gamble tbh,btohqsg
It paid off la but if it didn't I would just look like a mad man,btohqsg
PC while concurrently in Poly yes,btohqsg
Huh? U alr got an offer?,btohqsg
U are still a Year 1 rite?,btohqsg
Ok how do I say this kindly.,btohqsg
You most likely aren't gonna get a 4.0,btohqsg
bruh i start a new programme instantly got error,btohqsg
For STEM a 3.5 and above is something note worthy alr,btohqsg
i saw a breifing by my rp lecturers..they said that there were students getting into uni with 3.5,btohqsg
A lot of students in Y1 have that dream la,btohqsg
But it will die for 90% of them by Y2,btohqsg
its very tough to get 3.7+ in it for rp,btohqsg
I remember going in thinking of a 4.0 too lol,btohqsg
U ain't gonna tell me that,btohqsg
i mean for school of infocomn,btohqsg
will never be a 4 again ded,btohqsg
It's in Y2 when the dip starts.,btohqsg
U haven't got your first semester yet,btohqsg
A significant amount of ppl will drop out after the 1st and 2nd semester,btohqsg
And then only 1 idiot like me in Y3,btohqsg
You haven't get your GPA yet,btohqsg
That's why I say to just wait and don't count your eggs before they hatch,btohqsg
should i pay 20 bucks for new fish,btohqsg
No like I dropout in Y3,btohqsg
The only wanker who does so,btohqsg
By Y2S2 u passed the point of no return for most ppl,btohqsg
half of the ppl in my class are below 2,btohqsg
old fish 6 years just passed,btohqsg
my class right now got a average gpa of like 2.2,btohqsg
Yeah do u see how funny it is when Y1s said they want a 4.0 when u see that stat,btohqsg
Doesn't matter lol Y2S1 the amount decreases less for dropouts liao,btohqsg
Uni refers to AU or just Uni,btohqsg
Cuz some polys also count private unis too,btohqsg
But if it's AU then the number is skewed by SIT and SUSS,btohqsg
SIT accepts most of the poly grads that come out,btohqsg
you see the director role of honour you know alr,btohqsg
the higher the year..the lesser the ppl on it,btohqsg
Yeah but my point is Y1 Y2 decrease a lot Y2 Y3 very little change,btohqsg
In fact SIT is made for such purpose,btohqsg
70 - 80% of SIT cohort is poly grads,btohqsg
As usual tho the E skews the data,btohqsg
U are not understanding my point,btohqsg
NUS and NTU engineering have the lowest RP GPA requirements,btohqsg
Especially for NUS cuz CHS is a notorious killer,btohqsg
this is the best representation lmao,btohqsg
for soi  its Y2 to Y3 big difference,btohqsg
Y1 Y2 not much cause half the modules are simillar,btohqsg
past batches tried so hard for what...,btohqsg
Nabei if the 70rp system is now my s is ignored,btohqsg
YO SO PW NOT COUNTER ANYMORE AH,btohqsg
i thought pass would be 10rp or sth then fail 0rp,btohqsg
i have eyes lah can see lah,btohqsg
then by left can just ignore or anyhow do alr,btohqsg
Siao probably it's like a mtl requirement thing liao,btohqsg
doesnt matter  just get all As,btohqsg
Yeah that's the point of the 70RP system,btohqsg
my ns friend he signed on eh then he wait until that 70rp system is used then he go uni,btohqsg
Moe basically admits that the contrasting subject thing is bs,btohqsg
Which historically is what pulls students down,btohqsg
u saying i can ignore econs üíÄ,btohqsg
Especially in the bog standard BCME orientation its always E that kills ppl,btohqsg
start of jc my gp cher asked the class what we think gp was about and we were like ''the only reason why 88.75 people didnt get 90'',btohqsg
Like GP is a deal breaker for SG unis,btohqsg
They want GP so that the student more well-rounded,btohqsg
So now without the PW killer and Contrasting subject killer,btohqsg
What do u think is gonna happen?,btohqsg
Dk my underlying thesis is that SEAB will clamp down hard on 2025 with moderation,btohqsg
Yep the percentages stay exactly the same,btohqsg
And u gotta understand that most of those are from either HCI or RI,btohqsg
And that 1 legend from YI with 90,btohqsg
Cuz if seab doesn't become the bad guy then the unis will,btohqsg
And Big 3 would stand for Bigasshole 3,btohqsg
wtf ur double is the one with the bus plate no.,btohqsg
do yall think its better study in order of which exam comes first,btohqsg
finish topic 1 of all then move of topic 2 liddat,btohqsg
one guy covid 5D mc from there,btohqsg
to kill me from the start,btohqsg
because in the exam you may have 1 qns on topic 1 but like 6 qns on topic 2,btohqsg
Did this convo last frm this aftn till now?,btohqsg
Problem is I still cannot vote yet,btohqsg
Yes and it's the age whereby you can receive Stimulus payments,btohqsg
that's so much higher than most of the countries in the world,btohqsg
The cost of living payments and those payments la,btohqsg
Limpei technically have to get parents consent to enter uni one :(,btohqsg
i mean they are the ones who can pay your tuition fees so,btohqsg
Simi pay.. they sign my loan as guarantor la,btohqsg
There's a wendover video for that.. it actually makes sense,btohqsg
The main issue for European trains ain't it's country networks but its intercountry connections,btohqsg
For example if u wanna go from Paris to Barcelona u are out of luck,btohqsg
that route is scrapped I heard,btohqsg
Yep there's just no demand due to the gauge change requiring stopovers and changes,btohqsg
@VoidchordsLOL MANS GOT MIXED UP WITH BOTH OF US,btohqsg
there's american influences with personalized airplanes which only drive for like a few minutes from destination A to B,btohqsg
WTF YOUR NAMES ARE SO ALIKEBRUHHHH,btohqsg
Depends by what u mean by cheaper,btohqsg
Limpei also got scoliosis also.. what's your cobb angle?,btohqsg
truetheir public transportation is a joke,btohqsg
I mean this Is a topic with so many sides that I honestly dk which one to start on.. should we talk about the interstates or Amtrak,btohqsg
my american relatives told me that the train lines are so scarce..and how there's lots of people who assault innocent people on trains etc,btohqsg
so they mostly drive/ride their parents cars and barely take public transport growing up,btohqsg
Ok that is false tho there are many trains tracks and lines in the US,btohqsg
maybe it's because of where they live,btohqsg
ofc newyork wld have public transport,btohqsg
But these are mainly own for the Duopolies of the train cargo rail industry,btohqsg
but my relatives are not living in new yorkim pretty sure that person was referring to nyc,btohqsg
New york is on the east coast lol it was build before even America became a country.,btohqsg
In fact the north corridor is Amtraks most lucrative rail line,btohqsg
iw stay in nyc for one month,btohqsg
Nice you still haven't give me the class yet,btohqsg
yesterday was E today is a W,btohqsg
someone help me pls idek how to start,btohqsg
my sister showed me this before so it sounded so familiar,btohqsg
I gave my science knowledge back to my school alr,btohqsg
I dun even understand what they want,btohqsg
But my go to is always copying part of the qns into google,btohqsg
Then sometimes the whole qns or a simillar end will appear,btohqsg
2 day mc but 9 day holiday,btohqsg
what the heck is this even bruhhhh,btohqsg
i had 2D from weekend last week and 3.5D leave this week but with the MC it makes it 5D and got another 2D for weekend so 2+5+2=9,btohqsg
I would show you my work stuff but then I would get sued by my company,btohqsg
Bruh even more pattern than Bedok with his MO sia,btohqsg
thermo last time one of my fav ngl,btohqsg
ok what i don't mind knowing which is the cleanist toilet in campus hahaha,btohqsg
My sec school had one for water coolers,btohqsg
qn is how did they harvest this,btohqsg
once prob js to taste how the meatbis,btohqsg
at least i havent seen it,btohqsg
so i assume its harder to harvest,btohqsg
But i feel like lowkey disgusting leh,btohqsg
Not really it's actually pretty common creature,btohqsg
I think the isopod they are referring to is thishttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathynomus_giganteus,btohqsg
oh wait wow okay i didnt know that,btohqsg
this is why i failed bio,btohqsg
It's the same as putting a whole crab on top of your dish bro,btohqsg
looks like a huge ass cockroach,btohqsg
do ppl even consume this thing,btohqsg
Crabs lobsters prawns all belong to the class of sea cockroaches,btohqsg
Yes.. it has a similar taste to crab,btohqsg
The only problem I see for the capture is that this is a deep sea creature,btohqsg
Usually caught as a byproduct by trawlers which we all know is not the most sustainable practice,btohqsg
damn i come to this chat i see sea cockcroaches,btohqsg
As long as its a crustacean it can be classified as a sea roach,btohqsg
This is home truly where I know I must be,btohqsg
the biggest from this species is literally 0.7,btohqsg
Wait till u see a snake,btohqsg
what would you do if you see this on the corner of your room,btohqsg
Clearly u have never done it before,btohqsg
Doesn't matter bro just kill it and be done with that,btohqsg
It's how when I always say after my exams i will burn my notes,btohqsg
But when I actually finish I start to ask myself.. even my ancestor won't want this shit,btohqsg
The thing about sg houses I hate tho,btohqsg
Is that everything is fucking concrete,btohqsg
I put WiFi it's a nightmare,btohqsg
Yeah there's a fine line between the Madagascar cockroaches and the normal house ones,btohqsg
U show us your doorframe for what,btohqsg
yes the house ones are best to be eliminated,btohqsg
But the ones as pets are honestly clean as a whistle,btohqsg
I don't see a termite infestation in that photo,btohqsg
We got rid of it alr,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know spray bygone how many times,btohqsg
Walao it's like u bring me to the beach where sook ching occurred then tell me to just think of the past,btohqsg
But you can see the damage the termites did,btohqsg
You wanna see damage? Just look at any satellite photos of Nevada,btohqsg
Yes each hole is a nuke tested,btohqsg
ngl looks like my skin during puberty,btohqsg
The funny part about it was it was so common it was normalised,btohqsg
Be like hey honey why is our house destroyed again?Oh don't worry the government is just testing another bomb,btohqsg
u know how for O level e math there's the distance speed time chapter,btohqsg
if i use physics concepts to solve should is can or cannot,btohqsg
apparently I heard need to use their special method or they won't score you if use physics,btohqsg
dw i know what you mean,btohqsg
apparently need to use coordinate geometry to solve,btohqsg
cos the method I use is from physics and apparently it might not be fair to other students who don't take physics so much use coordinate geometry to solve or they won't award marks,btohqsg
you mean the maths method is this?,btohqsg
it could be a form of brute forcing answers,btohqsg
my maths teacher back in sec school did not allow it,btohqsg
cause you are getting answers without the correct method,btohqsg
so without the correct method  there is no method mark...and usually these qns if not in multiple choices will yield no mark,btohqsg
some teachers wont view it the same thing  and it sucks,btohqsg
ya heard so from my friend also,btohqsg
but for O level will they accept or not,btohqsg
Btw idk is it me but those lines dont look straight,btohqsg
confirm shitty resolution when they print,btohqsg
hold on  ill pull up the o level marking scheme for you,btohqsg
ok eg. this qns from nov 2022 o levels paper,btohqsg
your teacher is just being infurating,btohqsg
these type of teacher do nitpicking,btohqsg
is another fella say his cher don't accept,btohqsg
i mean its not like super scientific etc,btohqsg
its still very relevant to maths,btohqsg
that's why I shocked when he say won't be accepted during o level,btohqsg
cos end of the day  it's still mathematical understanding,btohqsg
i had a classmate decided to use his graviational potential energy knowledge on a maths question asking for speed of a rollercoaster,btohqsg
just noting the fact some people like to use knowledge gained from other subjects on unrelevant subject papers,btohqsg
I ever taught a student tip to tail method because I don't like parallelogram method.He used in exams perfectly. His teacher gave zero marks because hasn't teach in school,btohqsg
cos this one is finding average speed which is total distance over total time.,btohqsg
this one is speed divide deceleration = time,btohqsg
so this formula will get M1 anot,btohqsg
school nevermind. I understand chers got their own marking style but I asking whether O level will accept such physics concepts/formulas that math classes won't teach,btohqsg
The request lor its a one off thing rite,btohqsg
i was so lazy to go camp today,btohqsg
yes bro all part of the plan,btohqsg
actually i manifested i get such a problem but didn't purposefully make myself get it üíÄ,btohqsg
just the actions I did coincidentally brought me here,btohqsg
All the cool kids do it too,btohqsg
all of them went to DB too :D,btohqsg
even if i damn onz confirm cannot go,btohqsg
anything below 100% is an indication that it cld go sideways,btohqsg
bro i got sent to DB once üíÄ,btohqsg
They still ask you to shave bald rite?,btohqsg
i only went there for 4-5h,btohqsg
few days ago got 1 saf dude from kranji arrested and went to my placeü§°,btohqsg
oh thats why got mp van?,btohqsg
"i saw the report ""location of incident: KRANJI CAMP""",btohqsg
hm? wym can test or not?,btohqsg
i mean.... duh got test lah if not how to know he took drug and arrest...,btohqsg
Yeah my question was u go to the gym,btohqsg
Limpei give you a mouth for a reason,btohqsg
Says the ASA that complained yesterday that someone else book out at 2:30 daily,btohqsg
the pes E asa in my office takes 2 days MC everyweek,btohqsg
nope urine test only took q long,btohqsg
Thats actually how I used to get a 2-3 day a week studying schedule in poly,btohqsg
Was there someone who watched you? Intently,btohqsg
not really i think they kinda used to people like me  but they still kept us under surveillance,btohqsg
Have you ever heard of the tale of Darth Plagueis The Wise?,btohqsg
LMFAO MY BUNK GOT ONE GUY EVERY WEEK RSI FOR KNEE PAIN NOW ALL MEDICS IN NSMC KNOW HIM,btohqsg
he just come in there he no need say why he come,btohqsg
In RP u can take a maximum of 6 LOAs per module of 13 lessons.,btohqsg
then what happens if you take one more,btohqsg
LOA? U need to pass ESE and 100% of your grade is on that,btohqsg
huh i thought that is MO?,btohqsg
i think i remember that name,btohqsg
i only RSI 2.times so don't remember it well but i remember seeing him ard,btohqsg
see first if i go RHMC or not,btohqsg
or do we laugh at patients,btohqsg
like i cant keep my shit tgt eh,btohqsg
when i see a retard reporting sick,btohqsg
and im krhh so a LOT of retards,btohqsg
ever had one mf reporting sick at 8pm,btohqsg
bc he was scared that he was infertile,btohqsg
