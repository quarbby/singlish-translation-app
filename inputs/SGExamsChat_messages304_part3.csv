I anyhow whack for last year paper n got C5. Erm was last year's bell curve strict/lenient?,btohqsg
Not sure. But this is an easy paper generally.I'm quite surprised by Q36  hasn't been tested for a long time.In the past  they used to connect a resistor across PQ and ask why no current flows through. And the reason is pd is zero.They test it in a way this round where it is choosing the odd one out.,btohqsg
After B4  should be pretty lenient I guess. Have one student with some learning disability supposedly according to the mum  probably scored near 60% for MCQ. Still got a B3.,btohqsg

1) Studying hard is subjective. How hard is hard?2) Consistency. Working hard throughout the year?3) This one hardest. Working on the correct questions? If you study hard on how to do A B C but D appeared  it's as good as not being prepared.4) Exam strategy and management. Including time management etc.Off hand this came to mind.,btohqsg
For eg  my JC time  school starts at 740am and end around 3pm. I stay in library continue to work till 6pm before it's dinner.On the 1.5h bus ride home  I continue looking at my maths questions  before continuing to do homework after that till around 1am+.Every day for whole year.,btohqsg
Those were the days...i stayed in jurong i studied in vjc,btohqsg
Bus 197 2hr ride per trip...,btohqsg

simply studying hard isnt the one size fit all strat for everyone,btohqsg
do u write your own or consult your textbook while doing it?,btohqsg
if 2 hr trip  it's 20 hrs of travel a week. So much work can be done.,btohqsg
"because contrary to popular belief not everyone needs to ""study hard""",btohqsg
Ya eat and nap and do homework all in bus,btohqsg
everyone does however need to study smart,btohqsg
So much data can be used for students nowadays 😄,btohqsg
Sometimes my cca ends at 9 reach home 11 plus,btohqsg
Next day set off at 5,btohqsg
math is really just spam  but not only spam  corrections more important than doing so make sure you do corrections too,btohqsg
Somehow I always have this problem where the math questions appear is the kind of questions I never seen in my life before lol,btohqsg
