I think some people spend so much on their coffee.,btohqsg
Like my friend told me Bacha is good.,btohqsg
You drip your own is like $2+ each.,btohqsg
hiwas wondering what would an optimal route for psych passionate students / students pursuing psych be like ^^,btohqsg
Which education stage are you at,btohqsg
Do you have any univerities in mind?,btohqsg
i used to look at suss but i haven't rly looked into unis,btohqsg
can consider NUS Psych as well,btohqsg
isn't it first look at jc/poly first?,btohqsg
maybe u can get alternate opinions on the ECG Text channel on discord,btohqsg
wai y'all jump so fast into uni,btohqsg
yeah HAHAHA i didn't expect to hear abt uni straight away,btohqsg
Personally I'll recommend by shortlisting the poly w psych pathway ah,btohqsg
Bcos u said optimal route ma so we need to unds your end goal before we can share our opinions about the various routes,btohqsg
Clinical psych need masters I've heard,btohqsg
So someone should minimise the time they spend at each so called stage of education system,btohqsg
Ok not should but that is definitely a school of thought,btohqsg
How to prepare for EAE? Need to do portfolio?,btohqsg
Especially the course only sch portfolio,btohqsg
But sch portfolio everyone also hv how to standout,btohqsg
if yall looking to apply to uni,btohqsg
as a boomer im interested in seeing what yall think,btohqsg
how old do you have to be,btohqsg
anot jc tho but still yes,btohqsg
but in seriousness  there's two ways1. the slow way - rewatch lecture recording  read notes  redo tutorial qns.2. the quicker way - try doing math qns  then ask your cher for consultation  then go back practice more qns,btohqsg
i speak as someone with straight Us from JC1 to JC2 mid years,btohqsg
No point trying to whack tutorial questions,btohqsg
Until u somewhat know how it works,btohqsg
Until that point that is when u spam co sutls,btohqsg
Only can said keen in the courae,btohqsg
u try to fix ur write upLor,btohqsg
Not going DSA as JC not suitable,btohqsg
Wait get bad results in A Levels no way go NUS/NTU,btohqsg
Need portfolio of awards and achievements and a good write up,btohqsg
Maybe will google see how do portfolio,btohqsg
if you don't know how to solve the qn  no point if you keep staring at it uh. If you can figure out how to do the qns from the solutions and the notes  then kudos to you. otherwise  go seek out consult,btohqsg
i can find out from the solutions,btohqsg
I only improved after my cher forced me to attend weekly remedial consults with her LOL,btohqsg
No awards only show Sports get top 3 position,btohqsg
just work hard for it lmao,btohqsg
if got money go Australia then,btohqsg
The course COP is 11 pts,btohqsg
If u got nothing to show them then ur just wasting ur time,btohqsg
The course eg like Food Tech,btohqsg
most of the math questions apply the same concepts in the same way so once you figure it out  it becomes just a matter of practice to get faster at them,btohqsg
A portfolio needs strong leadership   awards and stuff like ur sgc is strong,btohqsg
Ur sch easiest to gather portfolio,btohqsg
Its 82748291919x easier to build portfolio there,btohqsg
My school I also not very strong portfolio I got 2 DSA offers,btohqsg
Like fr my portfolio is damn weak compared to my friends,btohqsg
