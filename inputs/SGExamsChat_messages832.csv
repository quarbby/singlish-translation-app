Hope you manage to find it. Digging for such treasure is no mean feat.,btohqsg

hey y‚Äôall  i‚Äôm an international student and i‚Äôm planning to apply to sg for uni next year. ik this is random but i‚Äôve heard that fruits and vegetables are expensive there  is that true lol?? and are they of good quality?,btohqsg
Hello all   any one here want to learn networks basics IP MAC.. and cisco packey tracer   totally beginner level,btohqsg
Price wise its dependent on where you shop but good quality? Yea rest assured on that.,btohqsg
Hi guys I'm new here want to make new friends,btohqsg
I want to study Nursing any advice for me ?,btohqsg
Do it because you like to help people  dont do it just to help people,btohqsg
Is this guitar a good deal?,btohqsg
Usually these guitars could cus up to a few thousand,btohqsg
your passion must be really strong,btohqsg
a job where life and death matters,btohqsg
"Honestly if your standards for ""fruits and vegetables"" isn't like sky highThe avg supermarket in the area will probably be fine and the costs are p ok?Lower budget options even include the stuff they are throwing out (maybe perhaps for scratches or damaged fruits) at heavily discounted prices like 2 bucks for stiff that usually costs 4 or 5 evenYou will be fine",btohqsg
Frozen and non frozen depends but generally frozen are as affordable as fruits/berries that are in season if not slightly more expensive,btohqsg
Fairprice is a good place to start,btohqsg
then u can try local fruit stores if u are confident,btohqsg
ty for ur response. idk some blog online was talking about how insanely expensive fruits/veggies are. anyways i‚Äôll take your tips into account ;),btohqsg
broccoli  bell peppers  spinaches are good,btohqsg
Do you guys ever feel like you don't know what to do in the future.And that it just scares you,btohqsg
dont shop at the high end supermarkets  cold storage is one example,btohqsg
Fruits from some countries are expensive,btohqsg
from USA  New Zealand and Australia prices range from $8 to $17 when already discounted,btohqsg
Just try diff roles and pick those that r transferable,btohqsg
Like global markets/corp fin in banks,btohqsg
Or just try diff internship if u dun like just resign find new one,btohqsg
Back when I graduated from university I probably had a lot of options in terms of career paths,btohqsg
Obviously some roles I will never consider like sales,btohqsg
At the end of the day it probably boils down to how well do you know about yourself,btohqsg
Like for example  I know that I cannot do sales  then I don't go into sales,btohqsg
I am good at numbers related  so I figure that doing numbers related might suit me more,btohqsg
Then talk to people in the industry and find out what they are doing,btohqsg
Eventually you will reach the stage where you get the job roles. Then the question is whether are you willing to take the risk and go for it,btohqsg
i wld disagree to a certain extent,btohqsg
there are other alternatives to success other than education,btohqsg
ofc education is important but not everything u learnt is relevant to ur job in future,btohqsg
my microsoft acc like keep getting compromised,btohqsg
How is it related to fairness though?,btohqsg
acc got locked down 3 times alr since last month,btohqsg
Meritocracy is fair only if applied adequately in different domains  in context of Singapore  meritocracy is achieved mainly through education level which makes the view of meritocracy narrow and unfair to those that excels in other areas,btohqsg
Is been long since I touched gp.,btohqsg
I wonder why you leave the A Level group?,btohqsg
super burnout these few weeks due to work.. i need a break. I will be back to help out once my workload is lightened.,btohqsg
Hey do you have any opinions about dell 3520 i7 12th 512gb ram 16gb?,btohqsg
üíª A global cybersecurity incident remotely wiped the personal learning devices of 13 000 S‚Äôpore secondary school students.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3yBXDO9Follow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
caused my microsoft acc to be locked down 4 times so far since last mth,btohqsg
Got multiple attempts of ppl trying login to my acc,btohqsg
when data breach happened i changed all my passwords,btohqsg
y ppl want to login to ur acc lol,btohqsg
maybe right they got same name as u,btohqsg
then they keep on inputting the wrong email,btohqsg
but its definitely from data breach,btohqsg
cause i got email from microsoft saying my email info got leaked in data breach,btohqsg
and they need me to reset password for security,btohqsg
Young people in Singapore are prioritising their careers and financial security over goals like getting married  according to a new study.It also found that two in five youths aged 22 to 29 in 2022 had never been in a relationship.https://str.sg/4z9PD,btohqsg
because yes meritocracy does allow people adequate access to education,btohqsg
the kind of learning they have will be different,btohqsg
those in wealthier families can afford better and more tuition,btohqsg
they can afford better study resources better stationeries better study furniture they can get their own personalised room thats quiet and conducive for studying,btohqsg
but those in poorer families cannot get such nice amenities  they will be deprived of top notch tution  good stationeries good study furnitures  they may be living in a house where they are crammed with their siblings in one room and its not conducive,btohqsg
and lets say both the student in wealthy family and a student in poor family gets raw 6 for o levels,btohqsg
do you really think the both of them put in the same amount of effort into achieving that score,btohqsg
or do you think that one of them had to put in more effort to achieve that score,btohqsg
meritocracy doesnt cover some other imbalances in education,btohqsg
education is the best example of meritocracy anyway because its based on merit instead of status like gender age skin colour ethnicity blahblahblah,btohqsg
I feel like ur arguement is diff leh,btohqsg
Mertiocracy is about the end result of education/academics,btohqsg
apprantly he was injured after first round,btohqsg
like is it fair to people,btohqsg
"I wld assume fair in ""rewarding"" people",btohqsg
Since thats the end goal of meritocracy ig,btohqsg
"I guess ur argument is more like meritocracy isnt ""blind"" to external factors and hence therefore unfair",btohqsg
I disagree with this statement as meritocracy is a assumption made by Bosses and Hiring professionals.The assumption here is that the journey to attain your qualification was deemed to be of a certain caliber of difficulty in the hiring personell eyes.Such difficulty could translate to skillsets being learnt or formed which they deemed would be beneficial to your posting.However certain skillsets learnt may not be redone or were only attained through a multitude of factors which may never apply at work.Eg. You were hired as a bus driver because you had spent 10 years driving a ambulance. The bosses made the assumption that due to your years driving ambulances  you could better handle stresses on the road and drive safer than any other potential employees that maybe had none.They however failed to account that the length of a ambulance and bus vary significantly  the piriority and advantages given to as a driver for emergency reasons etcThey still hired you over someone that spend 2 years driving a tour bus solely because of the reasonings mentioned.Hence like this example  a multitude of factors was given to you driving a ambulance which allowed you to gain the skillsets seen by bosses. However these factors would not be available to driving a public busso bosses can't simply make the assumption that you will retain the skillset to drive a public bus and hence use that reason to hire you over someone elseHence meritocracy will never be fair.,btohqsg
Yeah  and add on the fact that you are required to have a bus license to operate the bus safely.,btohqsg
js now ite gc js kena oni,btohqsg
Wah cb now i want see,btohqsg

but like there is p ah,btohqsg
‚ÄúHow am I going to pass my O-Levels?‚ÄùAfter the Mobile Guardian hack  secondary school students in Singapore discovered that years of notes were wiped clean from their devices  with no way of recovering them. And for some  their prelims have started:https://cna.asia/3AcIxzf,btohqsg
do it the old school way,btohqsg
write on paper is the best,btohqsg
thats why i write multiple notes on comp  paper and phone in case technical issues or losing my paper,btohqsg
At this point if your prelims have started and youre still referring to your notes,btohqsg
No cus i dont read notesüî•üî•,btohqsg
This fear of uncertainty will constantly be something you will think about once in a while. It‚Äôs recurrent and over time you will just have to live with the understanding that you can never be fully prepared to face the future.You can only face it with open arms and seize every opportunity given. If it‚Äôs bad  lessons are learnt. If it‚Äôs good  you reap the rewards you sow.You see as humans  having a mindset that can think for the future is a excellent trait but if you don‚Äôt have it  you won‚Äôt loose out massively.Ask any elderlies if they ever envision that they would be living in a 1st world country as as kids  many would have never believed it.Those kids are now us,btohqsg

No   I trust in Fate and whatever it brings   I believe one way or another it's something that will be helpful  for me,btohqsg
Nothing in this world is fair   and for a good reason.,btohqsg
you believe in fate because it has only been kind to you,btohqsg
Not rlly.. Depending on what you are talking about . Academics ? Nah my O's and PSLE are both terrible ( barely scrapping 200 and high double digits for my O's)  in academics . Life ? Well  my family is not that rich and I do not have an exact  normal family.,btohqsg
I'm not the worst case but I'm also not the best.,btohqsg
yeah exactly if you think fate has been decent to you  then i guess it's okay to trust fate whereas others are not as lucky  think about those with disabilities or cancer  do you think they will ever trust fate again? imo theyd resent it,btohqsg
Most people will if they have issues.,btohqsg
fate depends on the person but its the Maslow hierarchy and mindset of the person,btohqsg
psychology > safety > love and belonging> self actualisation,btohqsg
Sometimes not knowing about the future motivates you further,btohqsg
any advice for someone contemplating suicide  tldr; childhood trauma been through counselling since pri and sec sch but life js gets worse and worse  the pressure and toxic jc culture js makes me want to overdose. honestly the only thing keeping me going is the fact that i still have a gf whom i don't want to hurt. if you don't care to answer genuinely id rather u blue tick me thanks.,btohqsg
id say suicidal thoughts are usually passing in which case try to run from any high ledges  pills or super sharp things if you can,btohqsg
so your chance to be reckless is less,btohqsg
its better to stop immediate probability of attempting,btohqsg
"Thinking about ending your life is considered a thought that comes for a  spur of the moment or comes because of a trigger. Once that trigger is no longer present or over some time  you will no longer think of it until the next time you get triggered or experience this sudden spur of the moment thought.Like what josh say  just stay away from anything physically which would give you a easy way to end your life. ""sharp objects/ledges"" etc until you feel better or have something else preoccupied in your mind",btohqsg
everyone has different circumstances  background stories and factors to consider before being able to sort of pinpoint what we ( i say we because many of us are probably low-key going through this differently ) can do betterit's definitely going to be a struggle and it may seem rough but think of what you may want to do before actually off-ing yourself because you said you have a gf and i understand completely that you don't want to hurt her but have you considered that hurting yourself is like giving her twice the pain? if she were to ever find out because the guilt and emotions that slowly bite away at your mental health will slowly affect hers and back to your well-beingi just finished a sadomasochistic novel about letting go of your own expectations first  does a lot in building up confidence and self-lovethe trauma has happened  it's the past  we have to admit it but we don't deny it or cloud ourselves over it. maybe start contemplating or doing like reflections on simple things like what you want to be when you graduate  how can you live life up to the fullest because I know telling you who has suicidal thoughts is already akin to pouring salt on their woundsit's like  when you ask for advice or a listening ear from people in general and they just tend to vocalize on things that you've already thought about and tried to do but it just doesn't work out for you  i tend to just cry silently while venting to the SOS ( Samaritans of Singapore ) hotlines pretty much most of my mental breakdowns in this year but you should knowthis battle is never yours alone to fight :)- a stranger,btohqsg
what's the point in running away from it when you know if you continue to live it's just gonna be more suffering,btohqsg
honestly not much advice from my end but just wanted to say that I feel you  I gets how you're feeling  and that things will get betterdespite all the shit life throws at you  you have ppl around you who care  and ppl who will miss you,btohqsg
honestly it's not like i haven't tried to make myself better  i do lots of cardio  go to the gym   meditate  journal  all to just feel nothing. even after getting laid i still feel so miserable like what even lol,btohqsg
well good on you for trying  that's a start,btohqsg
i aso dk how i got out of my depression era,btohqsg
"sometimes I feel like trying too many things that's supposed to be ""good"" and ""positive"" has a negative effect lol",btohqsg
that's the thing about lifeit's mostly living with a purpose planned by yourself or a close loved oneotherwise it's just living aimlesslyit's just how we choose to take things into our own hands because taking the first step in initiating for support will be difficult  it will NEVER be something easyit's just that the way people describe their experiences with mental breakdowns and suicidal tendencies/thoughts tend to usually speak the lesser negative of their stories because they're usually to share positive changesif you feel like running away from stuff works for you  who is to say that you are wrong to do so? this is a very gray area and  since like what you've mentioned even if you do a lot of productivity stuff  you still happen to feel bleak and empty  right?why not try stepping out of that box? instead of just exercising  journalling  mediation and socializing-- maybe you can try to find a new interest  new social circle? who knowsmental health well-being is a very precarious matter as it's easily broken like feelings of trust but unlike feelings which can be earned back  most of the time mental health wellness just gets stagnated whenever you think you're improving  doing better and recovering? you just spiral downwardsit's a vicious cycle  i admit as I've gone through this since p4 and im already 18 as of this yeari would say it really depends on each individual because everyone has different coping mechanisms  styles or stress management. some handle it better  some don't  the others are just in between,btohqsg
i agree ! i have no planned purpose so it feels like im living aimlessly  i have been trying to find one to no success initialing for support is difficult  but i have done so  booking for counselling slots since p2 im j1 now  i have also tried looking for various ways of improving my mental health and doing them.i have tried stuff to improve my mental health  but im not sure why you call it productivity stuff? its just to keep my sanity together and distract me from my thoughtsi have tried to find new interests  i think i probably have the more interests than 99% of singaporeans but none of them helps me,btohqsg
The point is to give you a window of time to overcome it  it does not matter if you succceed in overcoming your trauma  the fact of the matter is that you still tried something. Eventually once you try enough times  you will succeed. Some people take months  take years or even decades to eventually overcome it.If you choose to end it  you basically decided to stop giving you that window of time to try  once you do that. You are shortchanging your potential to succeed. Why do you want to do that?,btohqsg
eh I mean you can have interests that are just that - interestsdoesn't need to help you in any way  as long as you enjoy it imo,btohqsg
great point  any suggestions on things to try or do ?,btohqsg
If you want to do something productive  play games.- Keeps your mind active and engagedIf you want to do something just for the sake of shifting your thought process  watch shows.- Keeps your mind hooked to a certain plotline,btohqsg
makes me wonder if most people are trying to avoid suicidal thoughts as that's what most people do in their free timeplay games and watch shows,btohqsg
"productivity stuff is just another term ( at least  according to me alone ) that is used to define interests  hobbies  things that you may or may not enjoy doing because they actually take up your time and energy more often than you think  if you don't actually realize it. that's why the term ""productivity"" because at the very least  you know you're doing something to advert your attention off your emotions or situation where the past seems to keep haunting youit may not seem much  but it always starts small with baby steps. you're already doing quite well but maybe you just need another outlet to let out your emotions instead of throwing them onto what you do ( study  work  interests  socialisation etc )i don't encourage this but if you have the money to buy boxing gloves or an extra pillow/bolster  you can just use it to thrash your emotions out on it like some punching bag silently instead of accumulating till you feel unbearably desolate with living any further morewhat i love doing is being selfish for myself and my own well-being before placing others' unless it's a national or concern big enough to alert the majority into them assuming im not okay just because i don't like the crowdwhat you must know is that im a scarily rational person to the point where even if my emotions are all over the places  i can logically and effectively point out the details  effects  causes etc to people and oftentimes  i'd just zip my mouth because i know deep inside  i may have been a disappointment but at least i know for the least that i get to live on despite breaking many's hearts",btohqsg
that's like the sad truthgamingwatching filmssocial mediasleepingeatingare the few main things many resort to doing to destress  lol,btohqsg
im so conscious of my thoughts and feelings that nothing i do can really distract me from them unlike other people who can be completely immersed in whatever their doingi used to punch my bed too   but i find railing my gf damn hard for like two hours straight more effective sorry if abit nsfw but after that instead of feeling better i just feel worse like ???like you   i would consider myself scarily rational too  im a science person  play chess  read up on rationalism  different schools of philosophy  used to paper trade and do technical analysis on stocks. and rn it feels rational to off myself lmao,btohqsg
"that is basically what happens most of the time  because both engages your brain away from any physical thoughts of harming yourself in real life.For games  if shifts it by reintroducing or concealing that sucidal or harmful thought as a virtual action.for movies  it shifts it by reintroducing or concealing suicidal and harmful thoughts as a script.For both instances it takes away the feelings which results in your thoughts and translates them into a virtual world or a virtual expectation.Where your mind now signals that ""I am feeling this way because of the game or because of the show"" and no longer have any ""i am feeling this way because of what my life""",btohqsg
well  they don't work for me at all bcz i already used to do them a lot so im very desensitised to them,btohqsg
to be fair  i still play games too hahaha not that i've quit  just like im so sick of life i dont even feel like playing anymore,btohqsg
They dont work because the games you play or shows you watch include triggers,btohqsg
if your trauma is childhood trauma and you play a game like Sims. That game wont help you one bit,btohqsg
if it does work for you  that's just it. period  end of the story. if you find engaging in intimate acts with your gf helps you feel better  you can try talking to her if she's up for it? see what you guys can work with because you're lost but definitely getting somewhere finding his way out of the foggy pathit may feel rational to off yourself but it's usually the emotions overriding your nationality because attempting suicide takes a lot of despair to be able to made that act  successfully donedont mind me replying to a single message but actually replying to both of your messages because my eyes are slowly giving way but i just want to stay with my pair of swollen eyes a little longer,btohqsg
uh miss  he alr said he got laid and still feel miserable,btohqsg
lol i just treat her like some punching bag bro   like i feel so bad and then after that i barely give two fucks ab her,btohqsg
This is why i said to avoid triggers,btohqsg
hmm actually im not really sure where you got the concept of triggers bcz its like a passive always there thing for me that's just gets stronger overtime,btohqsg
anyway it's late pls go to sleep yall,btohqsg
you want to play games  play games that dont include violence of any kind...your mind is alr mentally incapable of distinguishing virtual to reality  you need to stay far away from these type of games,btohqsg
i don't even have the guts to actl kms so it's fine,btohqsg
i just have one word for youhow does it feel for both you and your gf alike? it seems like a rebound relationship to me and you guys aren't willing to let go of the other firstmaybe it's the whole wrong time and right person thing all over again but yeah i mean it's just a thought,btohqsg
you dont have the guts...but its rubbing on the people around you,btohqsg
wednesday me literally looked like an idiot walking at 4am all the way from home to northshore plaza,btohqsg
hmm i usually just play chess so no violence there,btohqsg
is that a game you played since your childhood,btohqsg
damn i think she js treats me pretty much as a dildo ngl and sometimes when she's ovulating she does something nice so it's quite mutual ig lol,btohqsg

if this wasn't an academic study related chat  i'd go more into this topic lol,btohqsg

this is a telegram group chat based on the subreddit thread r/sgexams,btohqsg
eitherway as stated since the beginning  its just one of thouse spur of the moment thoughts to end your life..so like you said you have no guts  then dont bother about it anymore,btohqsg

the word helmet at this hour reminds me of that angsty story where the guy riding a motorcycle had his brakes malfunctioned and asked his gf to wear his helmet instead before dying in the accident,btohqsg
like the technical or backend process?,btohqsg
stalking is a level before doxxing,btohqsg
how do people access that in the first place,btohqsg
seems like people are getting doxxed left and right as if their private information is accessible all over the internet ?,btohqsg
some people have a wide range of connections so they either recognize people or have friends who recognize them and share a lot of case sensitive information which ends up gone in the wrong hands,btohqsg
like at least from tele & discord,btohqsg
this is more so for twitter,btohqsg

DISTURBING:The most vaxxed country on earth is now facing a population crisis.Singapore officials have tried to gaslight the public  but the numbers don't lie.Not only are excess deaths skyrocketing  but birth rates are also plummeting.The cause of this appears to be the infamous COVID-19 ‚Äúvaccines.‚ÄùIn 2021  Singapore‚Äôs natural population increase (births minus deaths) fell by 13%. By 2022  it plunged even further to 39.4%.This decline is unprecedented  especially when you consider that the total COVID-19 deaths during this time were relatively low.But here‚Äôs where it gets even more disturbing: Singapore ranked number one globally for excess deaths in mid-2022. Yet  as the numbers began to raise eyebrows  Singapore was suddenly removed from a global mortality database.To make matters worse  a law requiring investigations into deaths linked to medical treatment was quietly removed in 2023‚Äîright when people started asking if the vaccines were to blame.The Ministry of Health claims Singapore has one of the lowest excess death rates globally  but the data shows the exact opposite. Singapore is in trouble  and the government‚Äôs narrative doesn‚Äôt match reality.With births in freefall and deaths surging  how much longer can the truth be hidden?- - - - - -Americans are rushing to gold for a reason.
