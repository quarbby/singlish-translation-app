Usually they are those old jiji,btohqsg
Ah ok thatâ€™s good to hear,btohqsg
And usually you will realise its the grandpa that probably voiced out their xenophobia,btohqsg
The grandma usually don't really voice it out,btohqsg
Japan is one place I've always seen on ads,btohqsg
And slowly every year I'm getting more drawn to it,btohqsg
Well there are too many tourists in Japan now,btohqsg
Ic lol I rmbr during my first trip to Japan in 2012 I ate at some omu rice restaurant with some grandma as a cook and she was damn nice. I went there a few times during my stay around the area and on my last visit she gave me some gifts. I think most of the ppl in Japan seem very friendly but I hear theyâ€™re quite frustrated about the over tourism in some areas,btohqsg
The behaviour of some PRC tourists are reprehensible,btohqsg
The grandma usually is the nicer ones,btohqsg
The grandpa is usually the grumpy ones,btohqsg
I once went into a yakitori shop and then wanted to eat yakitori,btohqsg
Also when you first started working there  were you able to speak Japanese or you were forced to learn it from scratch? I feel like language is the biggest barrier for me should I work there,btohqsg
Something I never understood is how so many Chinese tourist from mainland china can become entitled,btohqsg
To the point they have that reputation,btohqsg
The owner was like please order a drink but the only beverage they have is alcohol,btohqsg
Some literally stand in the middle of the road to take pics and block traffic,btohqsg
You go any big major city in china   you can see their lives are not great  it's all a facade,btohqsg
So it becomes a bit xenophobic because the grandpa owner is asking if I'm from mainland Chinese,btohqsg
So not wanting a commotion  I left the shop,btohqsg
With the wife actually apologizing for his husband's behavior,btohqsg
You realise that the Japanese you learn in Singapore is not really enough for what's ahead,btohqsg
You know  knowing history  we have every right to be mad at them ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ok she must have actually felt bad,btohqsg
But yea I do pick it up and all,btohqsg
Now I can somehow survive in the office context,btohqsg
But you ask me to talk to Japanese clients that one I cannot whoops,btohqsg
Hmm how did you learn Japanese while in here,btohqsg
Did you attend like tuition classes,btohqsg
My first company actually give Japanese lessons,btohqsg
I know thereâ€™s some in singapore for korean  but havenâ€™t heard of any for Japanese,btohqsg
But the Japanese lessons is meant to prepare you for the office context,btohqsg
Of course I learn on my own,btohqsg
Plus living in Japan actually helps me to expose with everyday life,btohqsg
So I picked up Japanese from there,btohqsg
