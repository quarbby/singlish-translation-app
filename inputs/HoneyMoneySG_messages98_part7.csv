Hahahaha. Sure  if you closed it yesterday maybe still can.T&c clearly states that UOB can exclude you from participating without reason.,btohqsg
If uob drop rate  most prob all other will drop too. In line with expectation that fed will cut 3 time this year,btohqsg
Ah got it I read the tnc,btohqsg
Just enjoy while u can as usual,btohqsg
But i am surprised uob one pull the first gunshot this time round to start rate cut  maybe we will see more from other bank too soon.,btohqsg
I think unlikely for DBS Multiplier to cut rates. They already aligned with the nerfed rates... ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
For those empty out Mar month end for UOB  if pump in 100k back today  meaning the can only get the earmark for 50K getting the 250 cash credit?,btohqsg
Depends on what your MAB is. You can check back with excel with this method:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183200,btohqsg
Mar MAB is in the 90K range.,btohqsg
Then you can top-up 150k to get the 50k incremental tier for $250 cash credit and 4% p.a. interest from May onwards.,btohqsg
empty out 30 Mar or not dun really matter  since using Mar MAB,btohqsg
Haha oops luan liao. Just now I never included that ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Hi guys is there a lag time between money deducted from cpf OA for T bill before it being transferred to cpfia? My CPFIA still 0 and money already deducted from CPF OA. Anything I should be concerned about?,btohqsg
after this NERF which will be the next best bank account for interest ?,btohqsg
If on 1 Apr to pump in 150k  the 50k will be only entitled to 0.05% and lost out the interest on this 50k,btohqsg
Yes correct. You pump back 100k today for 5% p.a. EIR and register for participation for May earmarking for $250 cash credit  then pump 50k on 1 May after the nerf for 4% p.a. EIR.,btohqsg
How abt pump in 100k on 1st Apr  do register on 15 Apr  then withdraw 100k out on 26 Apr  re-pump in the 150k to earmark for the 50k to get 250 cash credit,btohqsg
But all is not doom lah  if uob stash dont change the rate and u have extra cash still can put in there for saving promo,btohqsg
Don't get this plan. What are you trying to achieve? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
To optimise the 50k in Apr  as 101 000-150 000 in uob Apr has only 0.05% interest,btohqsg
I don't get the withdraw 100k on 26 Apr portion...,btohqsg
To participate for the new qtr promotion,btohqsg
Just register in Apr  and pump in $50k on 30 Apr,btohqsg
Otherwise  register in May and pump in $50k on 1st May.Basically see which period u wanna go for.,btohqsg
Register in Apr would make more sense. You get earmarked earlier and cash credit earlier to move elsewhere for interest.,btohqsg
But why withdraw? You should be topping up 50k only.,btohqsg
UOB PPV and UOB VS for NTUC Fairprice and Sheng Siong. DBS WWMC for Fairprice In-App payment. Amaze + CRMC for Giant/Cold Storage.,btohqsg
With the uob being nerfed so how much to deposit on 1 Apr? 100k? Then pump in $50k on 30 Apr?,btohqsg
Yes. But you already registered for Apr earmark right?,btohqsg
I will just pump back 100k for 5% interest for April first. On May  see whether can find any other better bank rate.,btohqsg
Yup  just not sure what Kriste wants.,btohqsg
See whether other banks nerf as badly as UOB ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Yup i registered the eaarked for Apr for my account.My mum account has not registered for any earmark yet.,btohqsg
Iâ€™m still earmarked till mid May. Will put in $50k on 1st May then empty the account on 1st Jun to prep for Jul earmark promo.,btohqsg
Basically if already registered for earmark just now  doesnâ€™t matter if deposit 50k now or 30 April right? Itâ€™s still eligible,btohqsg
So for my mum  pump 100k on 1 Apr then register or register first then 100k pump or sequence dosent matter?ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
If SCB Bonus$aver not nerfed in Jun can get 4.13%  then 50k stick somewhere else.Nerfed.,btohqsg
Yup  have to evaluate when the time comes but I got a bad feeling for the HYSAsâ€¦,btohqsg
Can I clear the AC zero on May   then pump in on June for the promo?,btohqsg
"""Just now"" still refers to 1 Apr right? If you're okay to get only $2 in interest for your 50k  you can deposit now. Or you can put into Maribank for $120 more.",btohqsg
What's your mum's account MAB in Mar? This will affect whether she can participate with 50k fresh funds for the new promo.The most important is to maintain 100k in Apr to enjoy the last month of 5% p.a. EIR.,btohqsg
"The next promo is ""forecasted"" in Jul. If you want to wipe out  also wipe out for Jun?",btohqsg
GG liao...rising phoenix becum fainted phoenix,btohqsg
Same promo. Promo end 29th June. The MAB base on previous month or end 31st march,btohqsg
fresh fund is incremental amount compared to Mar MAB,btohqsg
Hi all  I am confuse here. I thought HSBC nerf travel  but I check heymax it say Singapore Airlines is ok  means some travel still can use HSBC?,btohqsg
Itâ€™s the card I give my mom to spend on groceries so that we can travel ðŸ˜Ž,btohqsg
We could only move in 100k today and think for our next move later. It is a great move by UOB to lock in more cash by using MAB of the month of March instead of 31 Mar after their rising dragon promo ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Important is today MUST move in 100k. Get that last 5% p.a.,btohqsg
