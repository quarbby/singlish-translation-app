I think we are really good citizens.... all just “mind” our own biz and dun kaypoh about others life and death much,btohqsg
Actually this part I have also been thinking.... is it part of their operations protocol,btohqsg
They always move in the 4 man team.....would it be good that the 4 of them split up and patrol more train cars and cover more of the platformsAnd stations etc?,btohqsg
Beats me either what's their actual sop. I was stopped by them before at an mrt station  asked qns & asked for IC if I rem correctly. Was like 2 or 3 of them in & ard me  while the other look ard to check on the surroundings.Not to say i felt uncomfortable although annoyed as i was on my way to my appt. Then they let me off after less than 5mins. Bohpians. Just got to comply no matter how we feel but kinda unnecessary to have more than 2 ard u. Unless they stopped more than 1 person.,btohqsg
Ya.... and also what I mean is they will be near each other in the station so they would be within earshot if anyone needs real help,btohqsg
There are some lending platforms you can borrow,btohqsg

Plus.. i dont think the car belong to them..,btohqsg
Yes better... lodge a report first to protect yourself,btohqsg
From the cam car  really can't tell who's at fault. So far only one side of the story  if not how come maserati fella suddenly for no reason wanna do a jam brake? 🤔Aiyah  in anw if the roads here are always peaceful  then i worry 😶,btohqsg
The Maserati cut in and did a sudden brake..... yes it’s the cam car fault for want to “Gao Gao Zhan” too.... wants to show his blow off valve,btohqsg
Anyway I am saying he is wrong to be so close and hit the back of the Maserati,btohqsg
But the way the driver came down and start to spew expletives and keep challenging the cam car to come down and talk....,btohqsg
It's sarcasm. As u know our roads here like every wk sure will have drama on the roads. Be it accidents or road users quarrel with each other... zzzz,btohqsg
Like i said  so far only 1 side of the story. Dunno what acty happen. Let them sort it out 😶,btohqsg

Likely. Two weeks ago I went to polyclinic because of cough and sore throat. Based on symptoms they immediately put me into the separate zone for ppl with respiratory symptoms. Saw the doctor and she said based on guidelines they have to do a swab test. Went to another room to do it. Then ave to stay home until the negative result comes out 2 days later.But not all doctors can do swabs. If your GP doesn’t  then possible you won’t,btohqsg

Hi people  I need an urgent advice. Does anyone know how much a Labrador retriever costs?,btohqsg
from 6k.i don't support buying of dogs.you can always adopt a retired service Labrador FROM army or police.they are well trained,btohqsg
it's not easy to adopt. they nd to interview and approve you first before they will let you adopt,btohqsg
I came across this post in an ad site saying labradors for 400. Im sure its a scam then.,btohqsg
Ive always been keen on getting a labrador cuz my cousins have one in Australia. They told me their cost 2k so i was happily thinking it’s probably around the same price in Sg,btohqsg
Maybe will have to drop the idea,btohqsg
Lab are big dogs   you need to be ready to commit to at least a few km of jogging daily  morning and night to be fair to the dog.,btohqsg
Got a lab in my block.  Super big and friendly. One big bundle of energy..  Easily 20-30kg.,btohqsg
Labrador = run die you 😂  use bicycle 🚴better,btohqsg
Also can.   Lab is not for a couch potato  owner need to make sure the dog get its daily walks/runs etc.   To be fair  can hire dog sitter/walker etc if not free.  Dun get dog is cannot do that much.,btohqsg
Holding off 30kg of muscles from licking your face IS a workout. Even a few minutes. 😅,btohqsg
My corgis already can walk 2 hours...😅,btohqsg
Eeh.. Wow..  My friend's corgi barely walked.. Just know to beg for treats 😂,btohqsg
I think sg has some dog parks.. Just let them loose and you just relax and nuah?,btohqsg

All the best man... I think being married/single have their own pros and cons. You may want to consider a little longer. Seems the first one you went to seems quite quick to many. Not sure about the one you are thinking.On the other hand  I heard of stories of people getting married within months of knowing each other. They attributed to having a common set of beliefs and shared values.,btohqsg
Yah. I not rushing into it. I tell my gf wait a while to let the economy stabilize.Also I got other gf outside so time to play play first while single. Haha,btohqsg
