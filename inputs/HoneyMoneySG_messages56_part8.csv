I booked a SQ flight in March viatrip.comand got miles,btohqsg
Do we use the uob lady card paired with Instarem amaze?,btohqsg
Thanks bro It's some Turkish airline (Air Arabia and Aegen)   and also Scoot.Not sure Turkish airline booking can get 3mpd?,btohqsg
Strange. My info was incomplete. I chat with CSO to update yesterday. CSO said my email istrip.comemail. Not my personal email.,btohqsg
can  to save on fx fee or cross border fee,btohqsg
hopetrip.comis recognised as travel as well. cos i just booked my hotels there last night ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
yestrip.comis confirmed recognised by UOB Lady Travel category. (can link with amaze)and also by UOB Krisflyer credit card (do not link with Amaze),btohqsg
UOB Krisflyer card travel category is awarded by description. Hence  using Amaze* will disqualify from miles earning.,btohqsg
just want to confirm thatif I use amaze (with uob ladys card) for overseas and my bonus category is diningi will get the 6mpd and amaze rates despite it being an overseas merchant (dining) right,btohqsg
Provided mcc fall under dining. Some merchant have weird mcc like for example japan,btohqsg
Some restaurants within hotel are under hotel mcc code.,btohqsg
How to see my Citi rewards points expiry,btohqsg
citirewards.comafter clicking a few links here and there go to points summary it will show u expiry of all your points,btohqsg
Anyone did refund via amaze ? Since now that the amount is back to my amaze wallet  I just exit via grab and pay of my CC directly ?Which mean free miles ?,btohqsg
u will lose 2% due to grab surcharge,btohqsg
Yes only by Aug. Interest will be pro rated. Ssb interest will last 10 years. GXS interest will not know how it will change,btohqsg
Just sign up directly to GXS  no code or anything else?,btohqsg
Whats gxs pls ? Some gov securities ?,btohqsg
Digital bank  partnership between Grab and SingtelQuick Google search should lead you to their website,btohqsg
May I know Iftrip.comis recognize as travel category then why still need to link with amaze?,btohqsg
if your payment is in foreign currency?,btohqsg
It has to be in sgd to be counted as eligible?,btohqsg
no need... but do u want to pay 3.5% fx fee?,btohqsg
Got it. Sometimes when I booked thru agoda it will default to the host country's currency. So to play safe just use amaze and link to lady's?,btohqsg
yes agoda is the one you MUST use Amaze + UOB Lady card and make sure you select PAYNOW to avoid sneaky FX markup/charges.even if Agoda is quoting SGD  if you don't use Amaze  you will get hit with 1% Cross Border Fee (SGD transaction processed in Hong Kong).,btohqsg
Very insightful...may as well all use amaze? So even though we use amaze uob will be smart enough to recognise the right category for the bonus mpd? Cause I read if use amaze it will be online payment category? Just want to make sure it's not categorise outside my bonus category,btohqsg
yes for UOB Lady  there appears to be no downside to keep tagging on to Amaze. Since UOB Lady uses MCC to recognise.The one that CANNOT be tagged on to Amaze all the time is UOB Krisflyer credit card as that one uses NAME RECOGNITION for certain categories.,btohqsg
the only time u CANNOT use amaze for UOB Lady is if you are applying a UOB coupon / taking part in a promo which requires you to use UOB card directly (e.g. UOB/SQ spend promos).,btohqsg
This is the opposite when I ask them to give me lower and request for a new card  then they said  please request separately ðŸ˜Œ,btohqsg
does gym membership paid using ezypay count towards any credit card cashback?,btohqsg
Will gxs stop new account signups like they stopped before ?,btohqsg
They seem to be strict for no reason  on matters that seem trivial when dealing with other banks,btohqsg
has anyone pay QR at hawker centre using bank app like citi to pay and earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi  can I use 2 cards to hit UOB one account minimum spend of $500 to get higher interest rates? (eg. $200 on UOB one card + $300 on UOB lady's card),btohqsg
can! both cards are acceptable to hit uob one interest,btohqsg
Sorry on this topic  supplementary cards too?Edit: seems like it's a yes after searching chat history,btohqsg
it was invite only all along,btohqsg
Is open to everyone I guess now,btohqsg
Anyone knows any other broker app like tiger that hands out free $ just by depositing moni?,btohqsg
Donâ€™t understand why you will do that. $200 on One will give you nothing. Might as well put on lady to get 0.4 mile,btohqsg
Webull  moomoo.... More like free stocks  than cash these days....,btohqsg
Just an example but thanks for pointing that out as well,btohqsg
Hi  can i check to hit the UOB One minimum $500 spend on the UOB Evol card  will paying phone bill via phone singtel app work too? or petrol using phone card to pay etc Would appreciate any help if possible ðŸ™‚ am currently waiting on the Evol card and kickstarting the UOB One savings thingy!,btohqsg
hi i just saw the video about amaze paring with citi rewards card  does it work well with local spends?,btohqsg
for local spends  amaze converts all transactions to online. Online earns 4mpd (except if it's on excluded list),btohqsg
ohh i see so it's still best to use the combo card either way?,btohqsg
then how does it compare to HSBC revolution?,btohqsg
HSBC revolution gives points that can be converted to 4mpd OR 2.5% cashback  on certain (but very relevant and common) categories. citi rewards + amaze gives 4 mpd unless its excluded MCC.,btohqsg
so citi reward + amaze would be a better choice?,btohqsg
or are they both good on their own terms?,btohqsg
