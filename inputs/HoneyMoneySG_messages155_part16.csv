Yea I don't think there's any other 4mpd offline card that isn't in blocks of $5. So I may use Chocolate Finance unless it's above $50  then I'll use either PPV  Lady's or CRMC + Amaze.I may be mistaken  but I think Lady's card  as long as your spending is in the selected category  it can be below $5. And then at the end of the month it combines everything? Not sure if I'm right on that,btohqsg
What do u guys think of using ladys for dinning and transactions below $5 coupled with ppv for any other categories?To replace amaze + rewards,btohqsg
