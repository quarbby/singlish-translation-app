We will warm up a lot faster though thanks to our ambient,btohqsg
Back in my nsf days  the diesel vehicles that I drive require to be 'warm up' as well. Especially the 5 tonners cause supposedly the break will not work if it is not warm up. Not sure if it is still being practice as it is,btohqsg
I agree with you for bread and butter cars… but for V8 V10 F6 this kind of engines  i will warm up ha,btohqsg
Engine isn't that fragile. Personally I don't drive auto car  so I wasn't aware about the Drive thing you mention.But then the modern cars have autochoke  when start they will idle higher  but if you move off slowly  effects would be the same.,btohqsg
super car yes. Infact  you don't need idle to warm up  can drive off after a while.  Some digital dash you will see the redline of the car decreases as the engine is getting warmed up.,btohqsg
The biggest no no is to full throttle even on neutral when you just crank your engine.,btohqsg
i stop full throttle when i hear “ EH FARK U STOP LA “,btohqsg
No wonder you change car like changing underwear HAHHAHAH,btohqsg
then i will slowly drive away hahahaha,btohqsg

Strange my message autodelete. Anyway its just 1 min cold start coded by the manufacturer to get your engine up to temp. I think they know best  if u dont wanna do its up to you  in the end the long term reliability is owner’s responsibility,btohqsg
