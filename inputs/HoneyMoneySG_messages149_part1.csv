Ya I search and found it's excluded from the cash back but not sure if it's accounted as spend,btohqsg
If there is no dp on this  call the UOB CSO then,btohqsg
but if something is excluded cashback  why do you still want to incur fees on Cardup to clock spend... worth it meh?,btohqsg
I just want to clock to 500 min spend to entitle for higher interest,btohqsg
there are easier and more efficient ways like buying Dairy Farm vouchers,btohqsg
Many wayshttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82II think uob one saving acct counts insurance as qualifying spend for higher interest.,btohqsg
hi all    anyone experince similar situation where stanchart insist they cant wavied off yearly credit card membership fee ? if yes   will they send a cheque for current cash rebate balance in the account in the event decide not to pay the yearly membership fee .,btohqsg
Hi in order to get the HSGC EGA 1% cashback on Giro transaction  do I need to perform the monthly 5 eligible transactions ?,btohqsg
Thanks. Does paying giro for insurance to insurance co falls under financial institutions (Exclusions),btohqsg
This one I‚Äôm not very sure so I dare not advise. For the fail-proof way  just transfer in 2k  and do 5x fast transfer out every start of the month. No need to worry or think so much.,btohqsg
if you cancel the card before cash rebate is credited/utilised.. it will be forfeited.,btohqsg
Hi guys  apply uob lady get rejected. If I like to buy air tickets usingtrip.comat 1500  should I go for dbs wwmc? However  seems like singsaver does not have much promo.,btohqsg
Dbs altitude first for new user signup bonus,btohqsg
Oh ok I will go take a look. Thank you,btohqsg
Actually the money is still in the card after it's cancelled.Coz long time ago SC auto cancel my Manhattan card  I didn't realize for a year as I still continue to get statement with positive amount. Then I called CSO to get the money transferred to other card.,btohqsg
oh cards can be auto cancelled??,btohqsg
Ya. 1st time hearing it after I chat with CSO  they can't do anything. All my old cards that's no longer available are cancelled,btohqsg
Talking about SCBI just got easy annual fee waiver for my priority visa infinite  I am surprisedI have 2 other useless cards (nus card) that have annual fee in Jan too  i am thinking if to cancel or request for waiverI somehow think the bank has a limit per year  if i waive my useless cards  i may not be able to get waiver later for cards like manhattanI used to like to keep many cards because it may not be easy to reapply@mttelegrammt  can i ask you  or anyoneüôè  for any personal opinion?,btohqsg
hi if my parents are above 65 and started cpf life withdrawal  what will happen to the money in their SA if they did not hit FRS? will the money in their SA go to their RA or go towards CPF life common pool as they are on standard plan,btohqsg
Scb tends to waive cards that u don‚Äôt use. So if u actively use their cards it won‚Äôt be waived,btohqsg
Do you spend a lot on that card?,btohqsg
Not really  I don‚Äôt use my pb visa infinite card and they don‚Äôt give fee waiver,btohqsg
This one by right need $200k to get annual fee waiver but I‚Äôm sure after this message many will come in to say no need and they got waiver.,btohqsg
TLDR: scb is a strange animal these days and I don‚Äôt profess I understand them. They have nonsense savings account strategy these days too. All over the place.,btohqsg
I do have hard time with SCB waiver last yearSo now don't know if to request waiver for useless cards or just cancel..,btohqsg
Their SA should have been gone by now. All should have went into RA  which will be used for CPF life.,btohqsg
U are not alone. Scb is bonkers with their credit card fee waiver since 2024.,btohqsg
Hi guys i have a question. Im just starting investing and planning to invest in the snp 500. Im not sure whether to go with either CSPX on IBKR or CSPX on FSM1. Since im only investing 50 dollars a month  any small trading fees might impact my investment. Do you guys have any suggestions?,btohqsg
Hi guys could I ask a question please. For dbs altitude visa  how long would the points last please? I remember my colleague saying the points for this card does not have any expiry. Could I ask if this is indeed the case and what about the free miles or points which comes free with the card please?,btohqsg
points on the card dun expire,btohqsg
hi still got abit cos still working. so what will happen to the money,btohqsg
In 2-3 weeks time it'll be gone. As long below FRS  will go to RA for CPF life.,btohqsg
If 50 a mth suggest do quarterly or half yearly instead,btohqsg
Hi guys  may i know if flight ticket purchase from airline website is counted as online shopping eligible spend for DBS livefresh or HSBC revolution card?,btohqsg
Can look into SPYL on IBKR,btohqsg
Hi all   when topping up to TNG using amaze wallet . Do I convert the currency to MYR first ? Or just leave it as SGD ?,btohqsg
CSPX in FSM1 via ETF RSP . But u need minimal $100 / month,btohqsg
You will lose in spread but the ETF RSP charge is still waived. so it should still be cost effective for your case,btohqsg
if you go IBKR you will be hit with SGD conversion cost spread. Either that or you change your frequency and see where $2 move the needle,btohqsg
I usually change to myr then load,btohqsg
There is a new Fraser Experience TNC update.. anyone have the detailsit appeared as handphone app notification... you click it the app will open  but the details didn't come out for me and i cannot find it anymore.,btohqsg
ah.. harsh nerf.. i used to like the $10 min spend for pointsand cannot hack the birthday month anymore!,btohqsg
Ya  looks harder to get their points moving fwd,btohqsg
@antonio191203ocbc replied that they are aware and working with the credit card statement,btohqsg

Will paying via Amaze using citi rewards qualify for singsaver eligible spend ? Assuming it‚Äôs a regular retail spend at physical shop.,btohqsg
HiFor SCB  i understand how it works for annual fee  BUT  for spending  even if pay in advance  the giro will still deduct full statement amount?Or if advance payment at least 10 days before  will then be excluded from the giro amount? Thanks,btohqsg
Best to check t&c in case they specially add the clause to exclude Amaze.,btohqsg
thanks melvyn. may i check if i vcma 4k to my MA this yr. can i still top up 8k to my SA to enjoy 12k of tax relief?,btohqsg
If i top up to shopeepay or use my card to directly pay the Spaylater bill does it count as eligible spend? OCBC rewards or Citi Rewards. Or top up using UOB Absolute AMEX,btohqsg
