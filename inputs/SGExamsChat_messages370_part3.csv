Understanding how to get to end point,btohqsg
even tdy idk how to use cosine rule,btohqsg
I cannot understand one I see I curse I cry den after ppr I buy bbt :D,btohqsg
a = sqrt(b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A),btohqsg
Huh cosine rule is easy üò≠,btohqsg
Loll i used cosine rule for physics like a math god and got dynamics wrong almost everywhere,btohqsg
ya u see  I also don't practise HAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHA,btohqsg
ik it's on the formula sheet,btohqsg
Ya that's y I damn confused,btohqsg
problem is i keep forgetting what to sub in,btohqsg
lmao maybe resolved angle wrong somewhere or smth,btohqsg
For me I rmb it as the sandwich thing,btohqsg
lost like 15 marks in my eoy because of cosine rule,btohqsg
Idk how to explain via text,btohqsg
Angle a betw line b and c,btohqsg
your dma alr tell you sleep a,btohqsg
B and c the position don't matter,btohqsg
that how I do it ah,btohqsg
(i was going to say i don't like congruency tests but i remembered amath also has geometrical proofs but on steroids),btohqsg
Or if u cannot must si bei,btohqsg
Cuz I like to visualise stuff,btohqsg
this year paper geometry not fun,btohqsg
bc  i forgor what the valid congruency tests are alr,btohqsg
Maybe I'll die next yr tho,btohqsg
I at first cock eye see wrong,btohqsg
good luck to you  you're on your own,btohqsg
I have to visualise and draw sia,btohqsg
Skip part i then cannot do part ii because part ii need part i then skip whole question. 20 marks gone,btohqsg
I kena for internal paper sia wah,btohqsg
I skip skip then before i know it 20 marks blank bruh then i had to actually start doing,btohqsg
i can even take furthest math,btohqsg
you want a photo of my PhD cert ?,btohqsg
Who needs bitches when you have chem,btohqsg
For me who needs bitches when you have history,btohqsg
OMG I LOVE HISTORY BEEN STUDYING FOR IT SINCE THE START OF YEAR LOVE IT üòçüòçüòç,btohqsg
the only 2 genders you know are RS right,btohqsg
What does RS and ez stand for??,btohqsg
LOL i forgot how to spell the full form sia,btohqsg
in sec2  i forgot what electronic configuration means,btohqsg
for left and right or clockwise anticlockwise,btohqsg
oh wait you already know right@kohsyan,btohqsg
His address isHelicopter flying underwater AVE 193902 #1000-26299,btohqsg
funny thing is  the 3 chemist were all british or sth but they named it in german,btohqsg
wah im amazed that i understood it without h2 physics sia,btohqsg
you know the opening of my house door is calledBill Gates,btohqsg
quantum tunneling isn't hard to understand conceptually,btohqsg
my chinese name is tee foo,btohqsg
lmao guessing a wavefunction is so common even now,btohqsg
like even my uni stuff also did it a lot,btohqsg
it's like you got a weird quantum state and there's no exact wavefunction we know,btohqsg
