Now it's not I want to be cb n say  but I don't think this type of thing need to come into the gp chat n check or confirm. Becos all the warning signs are in the job order. Asking pple to transfer money 1st  western union etc. I'm sure media  police etc have also been spreading warnings.,btohqsg

If feel offended in anyway by my words then all I can say is I shall just share less lor. I'm not an old bird but those who know me prob know I will just share whatever I can.
