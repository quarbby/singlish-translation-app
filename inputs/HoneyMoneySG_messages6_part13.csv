Currently I am using it from grabpay direct to crypto visa. Is there hidden fee that I not aware of?,btohqsg
Why not use UOB absolute directly ?,btohqsg
no benefit lo.there is another cool card call Mayback platinum card. still can pay direct for insurance up to 1kspouse can get too lo,btohqsg
I see. I thought UOB absolute Amex can have 1.7% cashback for insurance and medical bill too?,btohqsg
dont tink uob directly will get,btohqsg
Not all insurers accept amex. But most insurers will accept AXS,btohqsg
How about using it to top up grab and use grab for recurring payment,btohqsg
that will be tis method ma,btohqsg
does anyone know if there is any way to use my instarem amaze card before it arrives? (apple pay  etc),btohqsg
ahhh so canâ€™t pay through instarem app or add apple pay right?,btohqsg
then does linking Citi Rewards card to InstaRem Amaze card and using it to spend give me citi points for all spend?e.g. dining  hotel bookings  phone and netflix subscription bills  which were not considered eligible spend?,btohqsg
Not sure about apple pay cuz im not apple user haha,btohqsg
It should. It routes it as an online spend. Not so sure about subscription bills though,btohqsg
wouldnâ€™t the usual exclusions apply? so travel related not qualified?,btohqsg
Apple Pay doesnâ€™t support Amaze  Gpay no problem,btohqsg
Guys Amaze + dbs world woman card  if I make an offline purchase within Singapore with the amaze card I'll get the 4mpd yeah ?,btohqsg
Just to confirm this is still valid right ?,btohqsg
IS UOB Absolute the best cashback to pair eith gpmc?,btohqsg
Is there a way to enable finger print authentication for instarem android app ?,btohqsg
ok but paying for dining with instarem is counted as online food right? just that travel is not counted no matter what so whether you use instarem it doesnâ€™t count?asking because most of my expenditure is on dining then shopping,btohqsg
Because in the instarem app settings I'm only seeing these 3 options,btohqsg
And these are the other functions offered by instarem under this tab,btohqsg
Not sure where to find the fingerprint option,btohqsg
It's at the account login page,btohqsg
I actually these options I login with  Google,btohqsg
Fingerprint should appear under settings. What phone are you using?,btohqsg
Then it may be a phone problem. Mine is a samsung and working fine,btohqsg
Nvm I'll just use the Google login,btohqsg
Quick question  if my miles are expiring say Oct 2022  does it mean I must fly before Oct or as long as I book before Oct 2022 is fine but fly in Dec 2022,btohqsg
Book by Oct 2022. But then no more refund or cancellation after that,btohqsg
Signed up with your referrer code. Is the return value better to link Amaze with DBS WWMC or UOB One or Citibank Cashback or CIMB?,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc and citi rewards mc,btohqsg
UOB One is Visa. Cant link,btohqsg
Hi Chris  you mentioned in your video that you have a secret card for airport lounge access only shared in telegram. Could you advise what it is or point me to the relevant conversation? Thank you.,btohqsg
was referring to the BOC zodiac card but the lounge access has been nerfed/removed,btohqsg
Oh nooo â€¦ ok thank you very much,btohqsg
now travel open up alot of people looking for lounge cardðŸ¤­,btohqsg
Preciselyâ€¦ sadly that one was removed,btohqsg
well  i did mention that for regular employees  normally have 2x entry level miles card should do the trick,btohqsg
cos thats a total of 4x access to lounges per year,btohqsg
plus the annual fees are waived so can just keep the cards,btohqsg
for myself i hold the citi pm and dbs altitude  waiting to be able to travel again to use them....,btohqsg
Citi Premier Miles MC 2xDBS Altitude VISA 2xIf you have Citi Premier Miles VISA  another 2xMultiplied by the number of adults that can qualify for credit cards in your household  just go apply using my link@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Ok thank you! I can hold the card but donâ€™t use it to spend and still can access the lounge right,btohqsg
What is the criteria to be Accredited Investor for stocks in Singapore? If i just move in here,btohqsg
yup because the mile rates are bad,btohqsg
3 criterias1. income of 300k pa2. net financial assets of sgd 1mio3. net personal assets of sgd 2 mio where value of your primary residence is capped at sgd 1mio,btohqsg
btw you need to apply for priority pass after getting the card,btohqsg
the card alone doesnt give you access,btohqsg
