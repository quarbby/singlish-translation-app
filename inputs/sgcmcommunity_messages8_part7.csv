you do this often you will destroy the motor lol,btohqsg
The car is design to launch like this,btohqsg
i may buy one in malaysia to put in condo,btohqsg
The instant power in overtaking is too fun to use,btohqsg
buy with maximum options since no tax,btohqsg
FSD included this is the precious thing,btohqsg
Fsd is for long distance driving or just want summon car,btohqsg
city driving. that is the fun part,btohqsg
What are your thoughts on Model Y,btohqsg
Ppl snacth untill no stock but expensive omv is over 83 k,btohqsg
I see cause my china friend driving one sia. Model Y is mini suv ah?,btohqsg
Tesla donâ€™t have mini suv   model y is even bigger then q5 u can see for your self herehttps://carbuzz.com/compare/audi-q5-vs-tesla-model-y,btohqsg
Model y very high demand in China,btohqsg
parallel import this in malaysia. i calculate  it costs roughly rm280 or less for a model 3,btohqsg
the company pekema obviously marked up too high,btohqsg
I don't like Merc or BMW EV for now. They just take existing platforms and electrify them.At least Porsche taycan and the Audi e Tron are brand new EV platforms.,btohqsg
nah. germans or europeans lag seriously behind. they dont have the battery tech and software,btohqsg
tesla is light years ahead of them. and i think the chinese are also way ahead of the germans,btohqsg
how fast is your tesla 3? power in bhp is 300?,btohqsg
I agree with Chinese. Only plaguing Chinese EV are quality issues.I would say Porsche Taycan and Audi E Tron GT still could fight with Tesla.,btohqsg
among the germans  they are better. but still a lot of catchup,btohqsg
is this dual motor? what is the acceleration to 100,btohqsg
Mercedes now copy tesla also open retial shop liao,btohqsg
BMW ceo is stubbron. he refused to accept EV. these old fashioned ceos are torn between ICEs and EVs and so wont committ 100% to EV,btohqsg
who else can make best margins other than tesla? direct selling. and many would follow.,btohqsg
Bmw ev are better then merc 1 merc 1 u see like eqa and such is using ice platform,btohqsg
this will create frictions with their dealers,btohqsg
i'd say volvo poletar ahead of germans  they are full throttle doing EVs.,btohqsg
and in terms of manufacturing and scaling productions  again tesla wins. many have been sleeping,btohqsg
rm 360K + 14000 CIF + 25000 = 402000 RM in malaysia for dual omtor,btohqsg
this is like buying a bezza or corolla in singapore?,btohqsg
added advantage is that electric car should perform like laser printer as compared to ICE which is like an injet printer,btohqsg
ok i buy to use in malaysia. sepang track to play,btohqsg
They already know dealer is a thing of the pasthttps://www.nbr.co.nz/story/mercedes-introduces-agency-model-face-australian-lawsuit/,btohqsg
too bad dealers times have changed. this is the only way. dealership dies eventually and the time has come,btohqsg
do direct. users would be happy.,btohqsg
we have amazon in retail and so car purchase should be likewise,btohqsg
Ya this is a good readhttp://techzle.com/traditional-car-dealer-is-dying-out,btohqsg
Anyone knows the total toll charges to pay till genting?,btohqsg
Property Agent will face similar issue,btohqsg
Is kinda different as it is more of a service   and a good property agent help owner earn money   by looking for good buy,btohqsg
Ppl will be more wise to make personal decision. Imagine saving 1% commission and paying a platform 500 dollars for admin fee. Thatâ€™s like 10k vs 500 dollars,btohqsg
But rental wise if company like Airbnb will have ppl to check the apartment and do hand over might have chance,btohqsg
The $500 is not guaranteed for result and  you will have to spent time   a good property agent commission even 2-3% will guaranteed the purchase u want,btohqsg
Disagree. Thatâ€™s the marketing approach they want to pitch. Two key factors affecting property price - economic situation and demand & supply.The same can be said that car agent can help buyers to save money by anticipating on market and new regulation (aka COE quota).Example a person who bought a new car last year technically would have earn a few k or more. Doesnâ€™t mean the agent value add to you. There is a bigger force that shapes it.,btohqsg
To each on it own ba   I donâ€™t want to waste time to take care of tenant I let my agent handle and I just mark up the rental to pass her commission,btohqsg
A car is just a simple item for ev  like a phone   buy and bye bye got provlem go back factory warrently,btohqsg
Second  the argument based on that buyers are buying to invest which may not represent the full pic of all house buyers. House buyers may buy resales for pure staying purpose and they already know their criteria. I see such value added agent as financial advisors with the SME in property as investment. Just that today  LL need them to do the paper work. Iâ€™m sure there will be ppl who already know which unit to buy but need their signature to proceed,btohqsg
Oh well. Iâ€™m just bored while waiting for my food. Have a good weekend ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
A car is buy from a company like tesla   a house buy from me for example without any agent or lawyer is like I donâ€™t know how HAah   I put my contact in internet ? And ppl call me to buy house ?,btohqsg
