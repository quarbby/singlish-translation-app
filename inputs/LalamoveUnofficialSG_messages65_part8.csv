the x-grip one is good but must use the extra rubber band or will fly out. not suitable for constant removal for delivery. the finger grip one is better.,btohqsg
inside spring not lasting easy broke,btohqsg
this one good inside no spring but the finger dont know can lasting or not,btohqsg
the fingers break after about 1 year+  but the pack comes with a lot of extra fingers.,btohqsg
Previously I use one only top pull up and down,btohqsg
good . i just change from x grip to finger type,btohqsg
but its not spring loaded so wont fly out when moving. break will be when putting in  bend outwards slightly.,btohqsg
