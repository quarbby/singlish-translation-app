But like what Mt said  you're still paying for interest on the $100k instead of how much you actual owe at any point of given time.,btohqsg
Hi all  i participated in the christmas promo for UOB ONE account. The opening of my account got approved on 1 Dec 2023 but i didnt have 100k for the first few days. Only made it to 100k in around the mid of Dec. So how does the earmark thing apply in my scenario? Do i still need to zero out my account near the end of this month? Please advise,btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/153123If your earmark still hadn‚Äôt happened u didn‚Äôt make it for Christmas promo. .,btohqsg
So is it correct if i zero out my account on the 29 of this month. Then i participate in their new promo and put 100k back?,btohqsg
Have your $100k earmarked in Jan? Do you still see the $100k in your account today?,btohqsg
I have the full 100k from jan till today. But i didnt participate in the Rising Dragon promo,btohqsg
If u are not in any promo. Why not take part in rising dragon?,btohqsg
Oh ok. Because your 31 Dec balance is $100k,btohqsg
I‚Äôll choose 28th March to zero.And wait for the details for April promo  if any  to be released.,btohqsg
So i no need to participate in rising dragon right?,btohqsg
U cannot. If you had $100k on 31 Dec.,btohqsg
Empty it either on 28 or 30 Marbefore 6pm  then credit it back on 01 April. Then pray there is a uob promo in 2nd quarter.,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm applying for my first credit card and I‚Äôm wondering what CC should I get if you guys can advise! I‚Äôm contemplating between SC Smart credit card / UOB Evol card / Citi rewards card / HSBC revol card. Is there a card you would recommend?I‚Äôm not a huge spender and don‚Äôt do much online shopping,btohqsg
Remember ALWAYS pay the credit card bill in full every month! Don't pay min and roll over!,btohqsg
May I check empty it to $0 or still need to maintain $1k minimum amount to avoid paying the fall below fee?  Thks,btohqsg
If you already have fund and then make it empty then this already considered daily average minimum balance so not necessary to keep $1000,btohqsg
You need to calculate your MAB from 01-27 Mar/01-29 Mar is above $1k. If you have put $100k inany 1 dayin account  your MAB is already either $100k/27 days = $3.7k or $100k/29 = $3.4kBoth are above minimum balance.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs correct  but the fee is higher than moomoo or tiger.And the user interface is confusing,btohqsg
Hi guys do you think Saxo is a safe platform to invest?,btohqsg
Saxo has been in market for very long time,btohqsg
Is there a need to wait n enter promo to participate the event first before putting back the funds on 1st April?,btohqsg
Thanks.  Which means if there is no upcoming promotion  need to remember to top up $1K if already emptied.  Hopefully have.  ü§û,btohqsg
Wait for new TnC from bank. Nobody know is there new promo or any change in TnC. Once it is announced  read the TnC.,btohqsg

Is there an app that helps to keep track average daily balance?,btohqsg
Orh Icic. Do you track it on a daily basis?,btohqsg
No because I don't have a need to do it. But there are others who do.,btohqsg
No. Because we try not to have unnecessary transactions on the account. The daily average balance remain constant throughout the month. No need to track. Any amount credited in will be transferred out by 6pm on the same day.,btohqsg
don't confuse solvency with profitability. ie possibility that these companies will survive doesn't mean profitability will maintain (or increase) and you won't survive dividend disruptions or capital losses.Singtel  SPH  Singpost survived  but not sure we can say the same about stock total shareholder return. SPH is still around  but in another form and what was the delisted price.....?Also  airline industry is infamously high capital intensive and cut throat in margins....,btohqsg
so you mean that you check your bank account everyday?,btohqsg
If nothing in and out then no need to check what.. only the 1 2 days like interest crediting,btohqsg
but you may forget/dont know if someone transfer to you,btohqsg
Set calendar alerts? Why would anyone transfer to these accounts that should be untouched?,btohqsg
Means that will need to change the usage of the account. Btw  I am referring to OCBC 360 account.,btohqsg
Your friends are so good to transfer money to you with no purpose? Shall inform them to transfer to other account  eg. Posb saving account.,btohqsg
Any account that you need to track the MAB shall have as less transactions as possible.,btohqsg
U can set paynow nric n tel different bank. most people paynow via phone no.,btohqsg
For UOB One  Stash & OCBC 360 similar accounts  we should use them for the purpose of earning the high interest only so as not to disturb the MAB. If we need an account for performing daily transactions and still earn reasonable interest  I suggest using Trust account.  If you are NTUC member  you are getting 3% regardless and have a high cap limit of 500k  I will use that account to transfer in/out to other accounts to take advantage of promotions.,btohqsg
My funds have been deposited successfully in my long bridge security account.,btohqsg
what's your strategy? something like this?1 Mar deposit  1 Apr withdraw1May deposit  1 Jun withdraw,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if the shops like Lacoste  Ralph Lauren etc in takashimaya are counted for the eligible spend? Thank you!!,btohqsg
Esaver can just park for 2 months for the promotion period and withdraw once cycle end,btohqsg
Signed up uobam a few weeks back but yet to receive the $10 bonus. Have done the prerequisites of funding and buying a portfolio.#DPAnybody here received the bonus alr?,btohqsg
thanks. not aware of this previously. seems like next cycle will start 1 Apr. any promo for new account opening?,btohqsg
Hi all  for Citi Rewards x Instarem Amaze  is travel insurance eligible for the bonus points?,btohqsg
Insurance is excluded for any point,btohqsg
Hi for Citi rewards online purcahse  can I use amaze card at 7-11 physical store so it will become an online purcahse for Citi rewards?,btohqsg
About 1 month after you signed up,btohqsg
In UOB stash Account  first 15 days have 50k and then next 15days have 150k  still is this consider MAB is 100k and full interest credited?,btohqsg
Provided that month has only 30 days and first day of the month you credited your $50k is not Sunday or public holiday. Also your current month MAB must equal or higher than previous month MAB.If your previous month MAB is $100 000.01  you won‚Äôt get your interest this month.,btohqsg
