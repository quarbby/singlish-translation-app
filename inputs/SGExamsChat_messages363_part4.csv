Anyone got a math paper 1 solutions and pdf ?,btohqsg
Agree. They think same end ans = full marks which need not be the case.,btohqsg
My tutee last year did not finish 20+ marks of qn also got A,btohqsg
But his quality of work for those qn he can do is good. Presentation is precise and detailed type. So i think securing A is more on those standard qn u got to really do them really nicely and well.Difficult  qn  well many people will also find them difficult so you might not lose out so much,btohqsg
this is not true  your friend may have calculated high 70s  but he probably did not count careless. I got 67% overall (i recorded my final ans in calculator) and even gave myself some method marks for the qns i got wrong and still got an A last year.,btohqsg
thrs still method marks i think unless its part abcd then if ur part a wrong gg,btohqsg

Idk canto main thing is like the tones,btohqsg
