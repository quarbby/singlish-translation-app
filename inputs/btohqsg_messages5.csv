Mine is the sale of balance,btohqsg
And they scheduled for mine to be 24May.So i believe so its not delayed because i didnt receive any email,btohqsg
if no maybe no delays. if got they sure email,btohqsg
can i ask which launch? November 2020? cause i‚Äôm waiting for appt email too . for yishun,btohqsg
Yishun not yet. U can call and ask them but because of delay they may not be able to confirm the date,btohqsg
ahh isee. i‚Äôm from november launch too,btohqsg
My friend is under yishun also havent received the email,btohqsg
isee! you just received the email today or?,btohqsg
They will email exactly 2 weeks before,btohqsg
Anyone knows whether there is a marsiling grove bto on tele?,btohqsg
ahhisee! thanks for the prompt reply babe! wish you good luck for your selection!,btohqsg
if can't find the BTO group chat  either it's in private mode or no one has created it yet,btohqsg
Hi friends  May I know if I get buy resale then after how many years we can apply for BTO  Like is it after 2-3 year or only after MOP ?,btohqsg
Yes  and only can after MOP then apply. Last time few years back  can apply for new flat as long the keys is only ready upon completion of existing flat 5 yr MOP. Now cannot liao.,btohqsg
Waiting for BTO open for May üòîüòîüòî,btohqsg
maybe HDB might want to tarik... i duno,btohqsg
they too many back log liao,btohqsg
So those affected projects by covid 19   buyer got the option to change to re sale flat ?,btohqsg
Resales price shooting thru the roof. All owners greedy with hot demand.,btohqsg
So it's not a walk in the park either if cannot wait 6-7 yrs for BTO.,btohqsg
nope. it is still as good as giving up their current chance,btohqsg
still got 11 days to enter June..,btohqsg
guess which is the most sought after BTO of May,btohqsg
should be either macpherson or telok blangah,btohqsg
It probably be all  cause of the current situation,btohqsg
Im also waiting for sbf yishun nov 2020. For me Waiting is better than receiving delayed email i guess üòÇ,btohqsg
yeah  the previous woodlands proj in aug 2020 was so oversubbed. well so was everything else  haha,btohqsg
thought mature estate projects are the most sought after upon every launch,btohqsg
May 2019 BTO was launched somewhere on 22-May-2019üòÑ,btohqsg
Mature estates vary by popularity too  depending on whether its central and close to mrt,btohqsg
The aug 2020 woodlands more oversubbed than bishan  tamp and pasir ris,btohqsg
OK maybe an exception for hougang BTO of Aug it is the best plot even though its non mature,btohqsg
That one is like fake non mature lol,btohqsg
but it might be good to many that it is non mature estate,btohqsg
Non mature means singles can apply for 2 room there is it?,btohqsg
omg kovan has the best plot lah,btohqsg
singles can apply 2r flexi at mature though,btohqsg
Wonder if the kovan bto will be similar price as the Bartley bto,btohqsg
I reckon it'd be pegged to non mature pricing,btohqsg
Nov 2020 tamp was around that price,btohqsg
i hope woodlands 4rm will start from 270k or somewhere there  haha,btohqsg
I also want to try woodland,btohqsg
isn't the best plot of Woodlands near MRT? last Aug BTO,btohqsg
speaking of convenience  so far BTO till August  best plot is kovan,btohqsg
most expensive plot should be queenstown though it faces AH and 15mins walk to the MRT,btohqsg
kovan  one stop to nex/circle/blue line. 2 or 3 mins walk to the mall/hawker/MRT  5 mins walk to the row of cafe opposite/to row of eateries,btohqsg
imo  better than bddr and macpherson,btohqsg
yes please. hahaha cuz this time round it is not beside the MRT  it is about a 10-15min walk to the MRT. So it's not like Urbanville which was like directly beside the MRT,btohqsg
Ya but idk if mature and non mature really play a part in pricing or its just purely based on location and amenities,btohqsg
Every 3 months. Feb  May  Aug  Nov,btohqsg
they said based on the resale transactions,btohqsg
if people are lazy to walk  they can take a bus (which u still have to cross a overhead bridge to get to  so maybe 5min walk to the bus stop) haha,btohqsg
but one stop to the interchange by bus not worth the bus fare  haha,btohqsg
so i hope this will deter some ppl from woodlands proj  hahaha,btohqsg
yeah so might as well walk,btohqsg
other proj for May is closer to the MRT,btohqsg
yeah then you have a higher chance,btohqsg
your parents stay at Woodlands ah,btohqsg
if I'm going for BTO in the future  I'd like to pick one next to mall  can also mean there's a MRT station too,btohqsg
by then old liao  must make my life easy,btohqsg
Nope  hahaha  my parents stay in bukit panjang. not within 4km. I cud go for tengah (near bf's place) but i really like woodlands. I am eyeing Jurong East for Aug but might as well try every launch i can bid for for better chance of getting a unit,btohqsg
haha  no worries  i legit like this one,btohqsg
i already went to walk around the site and surrounding amenities,btohqsg
so for May  you are trying for Woodlands and jurong East of Aug launch,btohqsg
Hi all  are we really looking at 6-7yrs for completion of a bto?,btohqsg
if a couple starts to pak tor at 18  they can get their house at 28 ‚úåÔ∏è,btohqsg
means such a development might be launching in between 5 and 10 years time,btohqsg
10 yrs...sound like BTO investment for those current hdb users wan to change location next time,btohqsg
10 yrs.. really too far to imagine sia T_T,btohqsg
that's based on current covid situation,btohqsg
We're ofc hoping covid wont be so severe in a few more yrs  then construction can speed up  then wont take 10 yrs. Just that the 1st few couple of yrs might be slow progress,btohqsg
This is referring to GSW only. Not even launched yet that's why 10 years. From launch to key collection average should be 4-5 years,btohqsg
Last year CB  those units where the work stopped  I hope the water and moisture and rust didn't get into the structure and weaken it. Else would be nightmare in future.,btohqsg
Could see they didn't protect or place any form of covering over.,btohqsg
Already PPVC has many joints risk.... work stoppage without protection will worsen it.,btohqsg
whole structure on the jeopardy of tumbling it down?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if the May BTO for geylang when launch?,btohqsg
Next week is the last week of May if they want to call it May launch,btohqsg
Wondering what's taking them so long,btohqsg
They usually dont clash application week w PH,btohqsg
Theyve launched on 30 May twice before  so really no surprise if they launch on last day of May. Have to keep ur expectations low,btohqsg
This month flew by so fast cuz im just waiting for them to launch  haha,btohqsg
31st May starts on a Monday  so technically it's called May 2021 Launch also.,btohqsg
if cannot hang on  please consider the resale and save your option fee,btohqsg
Depends on your work location I guess,btohqsg
I am staying in a HDB flat at punggol,btohqsg
yes and maybe I'm looking at 2r flexi in punggol by the water  in 10 years time,btohqsg
haha mine is impossible to wfh,btohqsg
also  on sundays  now they are not allowed to work  for both allowing them to rest and if they work  the main con has to pay OT rates. which could potentially eat into the profits,btohqsg
I realised the same journalist has been writing such article for some time already,btohqsg
Maybe to justify bringing in migrant workers,btohqsg
Electronics are not meant to last,btohqsg
Especially heaters  ovens  iron and such,btohqsg
What about fridge  washer  dryer haha,btohqsg
Let's go back to the stone age,btohqsg
I ever thought of minimise the reno of my house  but not possible,btohqsg
Hi guys  some units write FF  OK and OF.  These are SBF  And i just want to ask. If it indicates FF  does that mean it does not have open kitchen? Or like if it mentions OK  does that mean it does not have floor finishes?,btohqsg
"if you are balloting for SBF  doesnt matter if is FF AA BB or CC. you will pick up whatever the previous ""owner"" have opted for their OCS",btohqsg
Okay so now the options are here. So im asking if example i pick level 7  does that mean theres no OPEN kitchen?,btohqsg
they didnt say. but u can confirm that they have floor finishes,btohqsg
if u do not want  u got to first pay for the tiles to HDB  then get your own contractor to hack them and put on new flooring,btohqsg
Hi  is the bto for may2021 open for balloting yet?,btohqsg
Sign up for HDB's eAlert  so dont have to keep checking,btohqsg
https://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BF08CESS/MainController?action=newHere. Tick the ones you want,btohqsg
aiya forgot to add one more,btohqsg
I must vote to see the results,btohqsg
seriously telok blangah and kovan  hard to pick too,btohqsg
oh didn't know the exact plot till now,btohqsg
Best plot taken away by Aug 2020,btohqsg
I used to stay Woodlands  i dont remember seeing this plot of land THAT big leh. Hmmmmmmmm,btohqsg
I know the park there got 3 pokemon gym =x,btohqsg
what way do the two mature estates lose out to woodlands plot leh,btohqsg
I think ppl wanna stay near parents?,btohqsg
So I guess many people stay there,btohqsg
My parents stay dkt  I bought bidadari under MCPS,btohqsg
eh bddr and dkt are within 4km distance?,btohqsg
Sbf applying will be on the same page as may bto right?,btohqsg
Not sure my mum status is (widow) age late 60s should apply under which scheme as I want her to apply sbf under my bto project.,btohqsg
my mum applied using these schemes too  managed to got an unit just a level below my new BTO,btohqsg
so it is a good as MGPS,btohqsg
Thanks for the info. Will help her to apply sbf for my bto may 2019.,btohqsg
Lol heard news bto delay for 1year..,btohqsg
But dun know my mum need to pay additional 15k anot.,btohqsg
15k for 99years. If 45years lesser could be lesser right.If not wrong in this statement.,btohqsg
But if the income not more then $6 000 monthly. Should be no need to pay the $15k.,btohqsg
Quite confusing reading at it. üòÇ,btohqsg
oh so the levy varies ah,btohqsg
my mum chosen 30 years  $15k levy,btohqsg
Ok noted. Thank you so much xw,btohqsg
not as if you ballot the earlier  the higher chance you get,btohqsg
May I know which area? üòÇ,btohqsg
Wat I know gt hougang and woodland,btohqsg
Hougang near to kovan when I not wrong,btohqsg
August also got hougang but is at the other side,btohqsg
but I reckon kovan is the best plot liao,btohqsg
How come nov bto hdb haven't release ah,btohqsg
Just a quick qn  if we apply for this time may bto and we got selected but end up we didnt want and decided to go for like example nov bto  will we still be considered as 1st timer during nov?,btohqsg
Isit only this list of Woodlands sbf for this launch?,btohqsg
Why in nov 2020 theres is the sbf for champion green.Now this launch sbf dun have?,btohqsg
I think I saw it leh,btohqsg
Which project are you guys balloting for? Haha,btohqsg
this telok blangah one is really attractive,btohqsg
yup.. sibei ex wor 4room highest 710k sia,btohqsg
Ok maybe I key Woodlands didnt show. I try search by the project name.,btohqsg
never thought the price is such a big gap compare to dakota one from last year August,btohqsg
telok blangah 2nd flr is 602k  which equals to dkt one 15-17th floor,btohqsg
Now the bto prices at mature area is.. wow,btohqsg
even its 3r highest at $500k,btohqsg
so people who stay there earn at least a combined of $7-8k   at least,btohqsg
I think most likely will delay one lor,btohqsg
Ok la.. with the integrated facilities on lower floors,btohqsg
Got McDonald's and koi can le ahhaha,btohqsg
Yah like machiam condo like that,btohqsg
aiya even if my 3r can fetch 700k upon MOP  I also can't afford resale of this TB,btohqsg
4 lifts serving the whole one block,btohqsg
OK ballot number must not higher than 10 to get above 33rd floor  including MGPS and GRO applicants,btohqsg
"<HDB eAlert> Choose from either the BTO or Sale of Balance Flats (SBF)! Apply online 25 - 31 May 2021 athomes.hdb.gov.sg. To unsub  SMS ""EALERT UN"" to90112222",btohqsg
wah skali this tb can hit ratio of 30,btohqsg
For SBF we can choose the available units once the ballot are out?,btohqsg
got date allocated to you depends on your ballot number,btohqsg
also have to based on the flat type you getting,btohqsg
For eg i chose 5rm at west crest just now.So it doesnt matter if we select other unit during our selection date?,btohqsg
other unit also 5r under the same area  within the same launch right,btohqsg
they will email and sms you,btohqsg
can log in your HDB account to see,btohqsg
Same launch different estate 5 room,btohqsg
you picked 5r means you can only choose 5r lor,btohqsg
if belongs to the same area  can lah,btohqsg
like example if bukit batok 5r within this launch has more than one project  yes you can pick any available 5r within the same estate,btohqsg
looking forward :7mins relaxing walk to hawker5 stops to workplace4 stops to big malls/MRT interchange3mins walk to kopitiam/supermarket2km to ECP beach1min walk to my mum'sNot CCR but convenient enough,btohqsg
If for SBF  flats  keys are available  how long will it take for us to actually collect the key and move in ?,btohqsg
How long will we know our ballot result after the deadline ?,btohqsg
from the last day of application,btohqsg
maybe couple of months depending on the project,btohqsg
as long as you don't mind wasting the $10,btohqsg
Is Telok Blangah Beacon the most expensive BTO launched to date?,btohqsg
xwdoes your mother pay full amount of the flat for short lase?,btohqsg
Cant loan right. Just about 6months before key collection sell the current flat to contra hor?,btohqsg
Yea true but for bto don't need to work for 10 years first,btohqsg
Still cheaper than many mature estates' 5rm,btohqsg
But prob the most expensive 4rm alr since I don't rmb kallang and bishan being this expensive,btohqsg
yes she needs to upon key collection,btohqsg
based on 30 years about 120k,btohqsg
must ask whether the potential buyer can let us stay for 2-3 months lor,btohqsg
From flat choosing to move in usually need how long ah?,btohqsg
I chosen mine in Sept 2017,btohqsg
pricing of this tb 2nd floor is like dakota one 15-17 floor,btohqsg
the project of the latter was launched last August nia,btohqsg
this tb project costs much more  I'm keen to see how's the pricing of the queenstown plot of upcoming August,btohqsg
1st appointment pays $500(NETS) and the staff will let you know how much to pay for the total amount upon getting keys  2nd appointment pays the $15k levy  which must be paid in cash  remaining amount to be paid when taking keys,btohqsg
Okie thanks for the info. üòä,btohqsg
Which one are u referring to?,btohqsg
After applying  bto  usually how long need to wait for the outcome?,btohqsg
4 weeks from the last day of application,btohqsg
Hi  friend  where did you get this data?,btohqsg
should be the highest in BTO launches histories,btohqsg
those who are keen in tb  for the seaview  please note the future development of GSWF,btohqsg
if you can wait for the best  then aim GSWF,btohqsg
but sure more costlier than tb,btohqsg
maybe got sentosa BTO in the future,btohqsg
GSWF is for applicants who are still schooling now lol,btohqsg
but when it's their turn to ballot  don't think most of them have the money,btohqsg
plus the sale of your house,btohqsg
if the pricing trend goes on  we can expect GSWF to hit 1m,btohqsg
combined pay must hit 7-8k for DINKs,btohqsg
keen to see the dropout rate,btohqsg
expect 4r to hit 740k at least,btohqsg
because by then shorter waiting time,btohqsg
referring to the most exp unit of 4r,btohqsg
followed by SBF > open booking probably,btohqsg
Open booking most flats not ideal so can't really compare,btohqsg
I am the first timer applicant  aim for tb  not sure for the chance,btohqsg
in terms of choices  resale is the best,btohqsg
Open booking more expensive than bto meh? It's leftover of leftover so I'm not sure,btohqsg
First thing is go ahead and ballot as long as your combined can hit,btohqsg
Those second floor near rubbish chute etc  in SBF nobody wanna take  go to OBF if more expensive ppl will take?,btohqsg
OBF normally means the project is completing soon  that explains the higher price since waiting time is much shorter  if one is desperate to move out  can't see why he or she reject an unit even if its next to the chute,btohqsg
if you have schemes to use  like PPS  have higher chance  laggi best if it's stack to another scheme  double combination!,btohqsg
. HDB SBFs are more expensive than BTO flatsWhilst HDB's Sale of Balance Flats are still subsidised by the government  they are still more expensive than BTO flats. However  they still cost much lesser compared to HDB resale flats.,btohqsg
though it never mentioned OBF is costlier  projects fall under this category should be closer to the completion date,btohqsg
wah Lao my BTO project that was launched 4 years ago still have SBF units lor,btohqsg
Will always have ppl give up along the way,btohqsg
that's why I'm looking forward to see the dropout for tb,btohqsg
last sbf  there was one on the 18th,btohqsg
may 2021 SBF has been launched!https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/sbf/intro__flats in dakota:cassia crescent 3R(ethnic quota 1 | 0 | 1)- #09-181  $343 000dakota breeze 2R(ethnic quota: 2 | 2 | 2)- #06-26  $278 500 for 99 years- #16-24  $272 500 for 99 yearsdakota breeze 4R(ethic quota: 1 | 1 | 1)- #14-38  $618 300pine vista 2R(ethnic quota: 3 | 3 | 3)- #10-08  $287 500 for 99 years- #08-20  $276 700 for for 99 years- #07-14  $218 400 for 99 yearsnothing much. dakota one flats not in this launch.,btohqsg
Bida 5 room more ex than tb 4 room. Not many dropouts for 1st round,btohqsg
I thought u think that drop out will be due to not being able to afford,btohqsg
actually ah one of the best conditions to apply tb is if your combined CPF have 200k,btohqsg
I mean that's when you're getting keys  6 years later,btohqsg
2013 BTO project - Telok Blangah ParcView is bounded by Telok Blangah Street 31 and Telok Blangah Heights  approximately 10 minutes (1.0km) walk away from Telok Blangah MRT Station.In terms of pricing  excluding grants  Studio Apartment from $113K  3-room from $304K and 4-room from $445K.,btohqsg
about $20k increase per year for 4r,btohqsg
anyway telok blangah MRT is like 6 mins walk on a relaxing pace,btohqsg
hmm actually not fair to compare since this tb project is 400m away to the MRT as compared to 1km of the previous project  but still the increase is still a lot,btohqsg
still can't get over why is it much more expensive than dakota one,btohqsg
is it due to this pandemic eg  need more cost to hire FWs,btohqsg
but cannot be since dakota one was launched during the pandemic too,btohqsg
Telok blangah more prime than dkt,btohqsg
Good view  point block  near sentosa,btohqsg
Those delivery possession date display in hdb are they really accurate estimate or usually completed earlier?,btohqsg
I think used to be quite accurate but you may be able to collect key earlier. Due to covid  current projects mostly collect keys after the estimated date,btohqsg
But new launches idk if alr taken the delays into account,btohqsg
Hi can someone kindly advise us. We have a very high queue number for Feb BTO. While waiting for our queue are we allowed to apply for SBF flats in this cycle ?,btohqsg
As long as you didn't book any flat,btohqsg
Currently i already pay the option fee for $2000 tampines greencourt. If i apply for this current SBF  will it forfeit my current application?,btohqsg
you have to cancel first if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
can't get back the option fee too,btohqsg
you confirm can get for this SBF?,btohqsg
I think aft cancel 1 yr cannot apply right,btohqsg
unless you want to try BTO for next year,btohqsg
17 family fight for one house,btohqsg
the second timers one even more dramatic...,btohqsg
17 FT fights for every 4r unit of TB,btohqsg
aiya want best seaview  aim for GSWF instead,btohqsg
since the golf course plot would be demolished for GSWF right,btohqsg
Hi everyone  just wondering for Macpherson Weave  will the noise pollution from paya lebar airbase be very bad?,btohqsg
Thanks for all.that's difficult to be success,btohqsg
by the time you moved in MW  just lun for another 2 or 3 years of the sound of freedom,btohqsg
yeah but I find it ok,btohqsg
to me lah  unbearable to others,btohqsg
242 family  fight for 1 unit  so popular,btohqsg
but just wondering how bad it'll be hahaha,btohqsg
if i have to at least stay there for about 4 years before PLAB move out,btohqsg
I don't find it that bad actually  if you're answering a phone call while a fighter plane flew past  can just make full use of your bomb shelter  the sound will be much minimized,btohqsg
one flies past  a few others follow  so it's like a couple of minutes disruption,btohqsg
OK don't take tb please  if you want good seaview  skarli you only enjoy a couple of years of the view,btohqsg
because the golf course plot converted to high rise buildings,btohqsg
True  I go for mountain üòÇüò¨,btohqsg
Mountain ah  tengah is nearer la,btohqsg
Really? I will go and check,btohqsg
nearer as in compare with other projects under this launch,btohqsg
you want mountain  then try apply for SBF at bukit batok,btohqsg
Does anyone have any idea roughly how much it is to hack down the wall. My kitchen is close concept because i took SBF but i am planning to make it open concept,btohqsg
No issue unless WFH. Been staying at Dakota all along and it has only bothered me recently. Past 20 plus years I didn't find it annoying üòÇ but recently when I'm home it does bother me when it goes on continuously,btohqsg
my sister hacked her kitchen wall for 1k (idk why so ex),btohqsg
i see that place like abit dark and ulu leh lol,btohqsg
Can I ask if the woodgrove application allowed you to apply for the married child scheme?,btohqsg
have u been around the area? lol,btohqsg
I have go tat place  but look ok for us.,btohqsg
not only this  must seek approval from HDB,btohqsg
For elderly apply sbf never indicate first or 2nd timer?,btohqsg
1) For Married Child Priority Scheme (MCPS) a) do we have to call/write in to HDBorb) is there an option for us to choose during flat application processorc) do they already have automated system in place to do the check?2) Does it matter if the one is main or sub applicant?,btohqsg
are there any telegram group for the macpherson weave project? pls pm me  thanks!,btohqsg
If you have a child  automatically hdb system will consider. Only need to key in when you have a child on the way soon which you can enter delivery date...,btohqsg
it has actually the 2nd lowest ratio besides tengah 4r,btohqsg
maybe below my expectation for such ratio,btohqsg
I reckon kovan will fare with higher ratio,btohqsg
and with pricing pegged to non mature estate,btohqsg
Also coz fewer mature estate units this round compared to prev two rounds,btohqsg
hmm the ratio of MW is quite underwhelming,btohqsg
is it because it is so near to industrial estates,btohqsg
Still have many days to go,btohqsg
Why tengar 2 rooms no taker for sbf  application rate very low. 110 apply for  689 units  application rate only 0.2% only.I thru normally single applicants will grap the 2room 99 year unit.,btohqsg
One friend of mine apply 10 over time just to get a 2 room at sengkang as single applicant.,btohqsg
tengah is like west of paya lebar on the Singapore map,btohqsg
broke dakota one record of 14.8,btohqsg
potential ratio to be hit  35 for FT,btohqsg
yes yes definitely  normal units already strike toto lol,btohqsg
but I reckon the profit margin not as good as pinnacle duxton if the cooling measures kick in someday,btohqsg
so it's not good for home owners if they are not staying for good,btohqsg
700k  still can sell at a million  should be easy peasy,btohqsg
but margin not as wide as duxton since their BTO that time started like $300k,btohqsg
300k sold at 1m already $700k profit lol,btohqsg
can retire by downgrading to the cheapest flat in an ulu location,btohqsg
all the above average income earners in that one and only block lol,btohqsg
yeah due to the pandemic and people can't wait that long,btohqsg
only benefit to the following type of owners: sell and downsize/shift to non mature estate resale of OCR  sell before shifting to new BTO later,btohqsg
Dawson got one 3r listing at $700k woh,btohqsg
sell at good price but resale also exp since its a good time for home sellers unless the above I have mentioned,btohqsg
as there is new pandemic every decade  best is to ballot for BTO 4 years earlier,btohqsg
pandemic this time is the most jialat one right,btohqsg
understood though they can be annoying lol,btohqsg
hmm don't know what measures the gahmen is coming up with,btohqsg
if longer MOP like 10 years  then those home owners getting BTO who are going after profits GG liao lor,btohqsg
example like this TB  TOP in 2026  can sell the house only after 2041 (can apply next BTO upon MOP met in 2036) since new BTO takes 5 years to build,btohqsg
means in 20 years time lol,btohqsg
yeah if their combined income got average of $10k,btohqsg
sbf ah? even more chor  probably $30k more AT LEAST,btohqsg
the longer the 2nd appointment  the better since you have already chopped the unit,btohqsg
as long as the construction is going on even at a slower rate due to this Covid,btohqsg
wah sandflies.... reminds me of NS days..,btohqsg
yes as long as any location has hawker/shops/MRT within 300m radius   these 3 are enough for retirees,btohqsg
OK you have lesser than 3 months to think  the most you keep spending $10,btohqsg
urbanville is the one next to causeway point ah,btohqsg
that one best plot of woodlands liao,btohqsg
even the plot of woodlands this BTO pales in comparison,btohqsg
but got your desired unit? mine 420 applied for 300 units  that time not highly sought after despite its under mature estate,btohqsg
but which one do you prefer more? kovan is a no brainer unless your parents stay in tampines lar,btohqsg
but you not keen in macpherson BTO this launch lah?,btohqsg
Can someone share why I can't see the units for selection?,btohqsg
I think because details not out yet?,btohqsg
Supposed to have appointment in 2 weeks' time,btohqsg
But they showed me the one for Tengah,btohqsg
Initially I log in was for Jurong West,btohqsg
is it because it has been selected?,btohqsg
Good enough to have some views eh,btohqsg
sorry ah I don't quite get you  you mean you are from the earlier batch of tengah project? understood that you have an appointment in 2 weeks time,btohqsg
kovan is better than macpherson IMO,btohqsg
I am from the earlier batch of SBF....Not the recent one.Just got notified that my selection appointment is on 8 JuneFew days back when I logged in  I could still see the units available for selection in Jurong West for Jewel and Glades,btohqsg
But now can only see Tengah,btohqsg
Does that mean that I can only choose Tengah?,btohqsg
probably means the used to be available units at JW were selected I thinj,btohqsg
So that means no more for me,btohqsg
why not call up and ask,btohqsg
I think even so  should be able to see leh,btohqsg
I have emailed‚Ä¶the hotline super hot.,btohqsg
Right lor. I also dun understand why can't see,btohqsg
or you can make an appointment with your HDB branch,btohqsg
to clear your doubts  within the next 2 weeks before your appointment,btohqsg
I remember I was helping my mum to see the available units for her SBF  I even clicked those units that have been booked,btohqsg
Is it ok to take unit that is low level? Is there any disadvantage? Any advice?,btohqsg
it all boils down to your criteria,btohqsg
normally applicants see the direction of the wind and sun  which I think it end up at the last of the criteria list lol,btohqsg
low level  very obvious no problem if lift breaks down,btohqsg
the con   the rubbish chute next to the unit  when the truck comes to pick the rubbish,btohqsg
and people downstairs can see your furnishings,btohqsg
oh ya one important thing I realized  see if you like the layout,btohqsg
true also  valid point  learned something,btohqsg
Haha. Wind  sun and layout are good. But low level üòÖ if people downstairs can see furnishing  close curtains,btohqsg
Normally rubbish chute is at ESS?,btohqsg
Nope. We plan to stay longer term,btohqsg
same  if i get it its also to stay long term,btohqsg
Haha. There is playground near my unit üòÖ,btohqsg
normally people choose to siam the PP,btohqsg
where the wake is held at,btohqsg
which project are you applying or have applied?,btohqsg
if got highest floor available yet facing the pp  would you want it?,btohqsg
Sometimes...beggars cannot be chooser.  üòÇ  worst is no roof over the head. Some tries like 10x+ didn't even get a date for selection.My 5 cents thot... no evening sun facings the bedroom.,btohqsg
3 tries all got number within supply,btohqsg
1 more try then can buy 4D,btohqsg
OK as long as none of you is pantang,btohqsg
PP is abit far from my unit,btohqsg
aiya there's no perfect HDB unit,btohqsg
Haha yeah lor but I am worried cos we stay for longer term,btohqsg
so you have selected your unit?,btohqsg
For sbf this month  we selected hougang. Not unit.,btohqsg
Erm what is the name of rubbish chute in layout?,btohqsg
Oh great. It's far from unit,btohqsg
your parents are in hougang too?,btohqsg
I used to be a resident there for 21 years,btohqsg
if you take clementi  can use MCPS though there's some downside,btohqsg
Sbf allow? I tot only resale,btohqsg
maybe depends on what area  I'm not sure but my mum used it stacked with SPS during last SBF launch,btohqsg
Hahaha. If u stay near  paya lebar  Sembawang or tengah airbase ... high floor low floor doesn't matter anymore  during heavy flying...,btohqsg
Oh I just check. Sbf allow,btohqsg
But there is no sbf near clementi haha. Also clementi hdb price is exp,btohqsg
yeah the sound of freedom  and my BTO is one stop next to PLB,btohqsg
used to it since I'm staying at punggol,btohqsg
Hihi! Let's say I have applied for the SBF this month and indicated my choice of town...Then now  want to change the choice of town  is it possible?,btohqsg
not sure is it possible to amend your choice or have to spend $10,btohqsg
We can resubmit a new application?,btohqsg
But will we still be considered first timer?,btohqsg
Omg great  thanks for the clarification,btohqsg
Hi guys  just wondering  if I were to apply for May's BTO launch and get a number for e.g. macpherson weave  can I still apply for the Kovan BTO in august?,btohqsg
I'm quite sure you can  as long as you havent gone for the 1st appointment of May BTO  you can still bid for August BTO in the meantime,btohqsg
Hi Everyone! I will like to check if I applied for a BTO under MCPS.Do I qualify under the scheme if my parents own a flat in another location outside of the 4km radius but IC indicates the residency under the flat within 4km boundary?,btohqsg
definitely can  say if you're given a selection date that is after mid Sept (my guess)  you can apply for Aug BTO without any worry,btohqsg
sounds complex  but I think follow the IC address no wrong lah,btohqsg
Hahaha! Thanks thanks!Actually there‚Äôs a part 2 to that question  which makes it worse.They‚Äôre overseas so I wonder does the MCPS still come in effect.,btohqsg
your parents have to answer video call from HDB upon your unit selection,btohqsg
To prove the residency is it?,btohqsg
and your birth cert I think,btohqsg
Ah I see! Thanks a lot! First timer here üòÖ,btohqsg
oh now then I got what you mean  means your parents are staying oversea but their official home address here is the one on their IC,btohqsg
Yeah  kind of. But due to some complications  my mum‚Äôs residency is within 4km (on ic). But my parents still owns a flat together(out side of 4km).Both are overseas still. üòÖüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
So due to my condition  I‚Äôm wondering if this is applicable for MCPS.,btohqsg
I dont have the option to reselect another town,btohqsg
if you are really wish to book another flat and cancel the previous one  i think you should call HDB first thing monday! since that‚Äôs the last day,btohqsg
To make an enquiry  please go to MyRequest@HDB or call our Sales/Resale Customer Service Line at 1800-8663066 during office hours  Monday to Friday  8.00am to 5.00pm.,btohqsg
not sure if they take such requests but worth a shot,btohqsg
After may SBF  when the next one gonna be?,btohqsg
To my understanding  regardless or how dire your situation or reason is  I dun think HDB will acceed to let u change just like that. You will be first in the history since Singapore's independence.,btohqsg
well somebody‚Äôs got to set a precedent right üôÇ,btohqsg
should be the add shown on your parents IC  to be taken into consideration for the proximity scheme,btohqsg
We bought a resale flat and took the grant but never ballot BTO before. Are we consider as first timer?,btohqsg
hawt line to call hdb  the staffs are sure to get bombarded by questions from the applicants,btohqsg
hmm amendment of the flat type...,btohqsg
just think carefully before you spend another $10,btohqsg
Should be able to cancel your current application then reapply,btohqsg
Last time can just cancel online,btohqsg
Hey guys! Thanks for all the responses. I managed to cancel my first application and have submitted a new application,btohqsg
are units really unbearably hot w fan if half the year the sunlight directly shines into the house?,btohqsg
no idea  anyone else can help@Mini_vivi?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know  if me and my fianc√© are planning to apply for SBF  and example the SBF is already built and ready to move in  but we have yet to ROM is it possible ? Is there like a timeline for example you must produce the ROM cert within 6 month of applying if we manage to get the house ?,btohqsg
Sorry  yeah as in can apply and also as long as produce the cert within 6 mth after?,btohqsg
fianc√© /fianc√©e must produce their marriage cert for inspection by HDB within 3 months after taking possession of the flat,btohqsg
If u dont have cert when your house is ready must appeal for the within 3 months after possession,btohqsg
After hearing that from the hdb  i didnt want to have the hassle to appeal and hence planning an earlier wedding to meet the date.,btohqsg
OK though I married before applying BTO,btohqsg
this is a very helpful site to calculate your stamp duties upon payment on your 2nd appt aka signing of lease of agreement LOA,btohqsg
note that the ABSD is based on 5% (if any is below 30yo) for two main applicants,btohqsg
you still have to pay 10% if both of you are above 30yo at the time of BTO application,btohqsg
The 5%/10% thing is only for downpayment,btohqsg
No ABSD if you don't already own a property,btohqsg
yeah my ABSD refers to down-payment  I was just following what was stated on the site,btohqsg
Hi All  would like to ask if my parents house currently under SERS(enblock). And I would like to apply BTO staying near parents shld I put my new address or old address when applying?,btohqsg
you mean you want to apply MCPS?,btohqsg
have to check with your HDB branch by calling them,btohqsg
Planning to married but not yet üòÇ consider under mcps?,btohqsg
Are u referring to correspondence address or mcps address?,btohqsg
Can  if the bto you're applying for is within 4km of parents hse,btohqsg
The site didn't refer to ABSD as downpayment ü§î,btohqsg
With current address or the new one?,btohqsg
U non citizen? My absd shows 0,btohqsg
Not sure about this  better to check with hdb.,btohqsg
which part am I not sounding like a sinkie sia,btohqsg
I look like non sinkie to you ah,btohqsg
Ok not sure what you selected to get 5% absd,btohqsg
so obvious my wife is PR lah lol,btohqsg
Ok lah then the 5% ABSD is coz your wife PR,btohqsg
so I just followed what it was stated there  hence the confusion here,btohqsg
Anw it's a good tool for calculating downpayment + stamp duty amount,btohqsg
For Singaporeans just select the PR option instead to calculate the 5% amount,btohqsg
but my wife and I paid about $27200 don't know where the gap came from,btohqsg
I check my appt letter  still have conveyancing fee of $395,btohqsg
Why all your BSD so high one,btohqsg
4r in mature estate mah  mine 3r,btohqsg
If you full pay the bto  will there still be any interest added to it ?,btohqsg
Means upon collection of keys if I‚Äôve decided to full pay the balance 90 percent . Will there be an interest added to this 90 percent,btohqsg
If you pay with cpf  when you sell your flat you'll have to return the money to your cpf with accrued interest,btohqsg
If you alr pay in full there's nothing to charge interest on,btohqsg
Okayyy so better to full pay in cash than cpf right,btohqsg
Depends on whether you can earn more than 2.5% with your cash,btohqsg
Cose I feel paying mthly = technically u are paying more for the house .,btohqsg
unless he down-payment in cash too  otherwise AI still applies,btohqsg
Was wondering if pay by cash have interest added to it . But Thks ! Got a clearer view now,btohqsg
1. use cash for home loan while accumulating OA+minimise AI of 2.5%-can't save up2. use OA for home loan while topping up SA+accumulating 1.5% of interest-can't save up3. use OA for home loan+save up-accumulating 2.5% of AIunless can use cash to generate >2.5% of interest  accumulate CPFOA,btohqsg
Down pay 10 percent and planning to full pay the 90 only when collection of keys ( but was abit confuse to the interest part ),btohqsg
many people thought this way too,btohqsg
See if can get the house first lol ahahhahaha . So many ppl applied for the Bukit Merah house,btohqsg
no interest as long as your CPFOA is not involved  but you paid cash for the 5% down-payment too?,btohqsg
should be the most in BTO history,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still waiting if I can even get a ballot,btohqsg
plan your finance well especially in this crisis,btohqsg
But if I don‚Äôt get then I think I might try for an ec - the waiting time isn‚Äôt so long compared to the bto houses ( I think ),btohqsg
Just asking ard for advise :),btohqsg
Good luck to everyone who is balloting hhaha,btohqsg
1. use cash for housing while accumulating OA+accumulate annual int of 2.5%-much much poorer,btohqsg
Save money . Pay lesser I guess ?  2.5 percent interest is a lot . Can use that for other investmentBut since no interest is added if u full cash then that‚Äôs good I guess . Doesn‚Äôt work the same for cars. I had to pay a slight interest when I full cash the car .,btohqsg
people applying for TB are high earners for sure,btohqsg
It would be a wise choice if u wanna sell it in future I guess,btohqsg
But cpf interest rate high . Hahaha I‚Äôm losing out on that,btohqsg
profit margin should be lower than duxton,btohqsg
I find TB nicer in design,btohqsg
It‚Äôs facing the sea right ?,btohqsg
only for units above 32nd floor,btohqsg
70 units onlyahhaha and the number of applications,btohqsg
because the condo is 31 storey high,btohqsg
normally people who are paying cash in full are elders and couples who are shifting to their 2nd subsidised HDB flat,btohqsg
Can you guys tell me bto woodgrove ascent have balcony or not?,btohqsg
oh then you may consider trying for dakota breeze under SBF,btohqsg
though it deprives you from applying BTO this launch,btohqsg
Why don't try 3room for much higher chance haha,btohqsg
I‚Äôm 23 . Not so old yet . üòÇ,btohqsg
It‚Äôs even smaller . The 4 room is already not that huge,btohqsg
And I think we can only apply for 1 right ? Not more than that,btohqsg
23yo thinking to pay the house in full upon getting keys üò≥,btohqsg
Ya I mean apply 3 room instead of 4,btohqsg
yes just one project and one flat type,btohqsg
The house will take 5 years man . 64 mths . Crazy waiting timing . Due to covid I guess,btohqsg
for SBF  many projects and one flat type,btohqsg
I applied for the 4 already,btohqsg
They shld allow more than 1 . At least if we don‚Äôt get our first choice we can still get a second or third . Or else need to wait for next launch .,btohqsg
they should not allow  to maximise profits lol,btohqsg
After appeal  how much more time will they give ?,btohqsg
If you change your mind can cancel,btohqsg
Hahaha no no hahahaah I‚Äôm happy with the 4,btohqsg
Female rich must be taitai meh :P,btohqsg
singles cannot apply at mature estate woh,btohqsg
Omg no . Hahaha . I‚Äôm average .,btohqsg
For MCPS  can parents sell their house after I get the SBF unit?,btohqsg
Haha as in taitai means husband rich and she dunnid work,btohqsg
Cos they‚Äôre thinking of moving to a bto/SBF flexi from their  3rm,btohqsg
hmm tiagong can sell but getting house within the 4km?if I don't get it wrongly,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not always the guy has to be the one leading right hahaha,btohqsg
Yes can as long as they buy another place within 4km of your unit,btohqsg
what stage are you at now,btohqsg
Applied SBF with mcps  pending outcome,btohqsg
Need to appeal but i think they're quite strict,btohqsg
why not apply BTO stack with MGPS if all of you are staying for good with no intention in getting the next subsidised HDB flat?,btohqsg
stand a very good chance with this scheme but must consider carefully,btohqsg
what freelance are you doing anyway,btohqsg
Teaching . Relief moe teacher and full time tutor,btohqsg
I was still a NSF at your age lol,btohqsg
only within 4km  they got a system to track,btohqsg
Should had sign on . Good pau,btohqsg
my body frame does not allow me lol,btohqsg
Basically once your appeal is approved i guess within your first 3 months u need to show your cert.This happens only when u dont have ur ROM certificate on collection day. And they need some kind of proof,btohqsg
Im not too sure too because i just went for my flat selection ... but thats what HDB told me.,btohqsg
Btw  key collection date is given by HDB right? And must go on that certain day right? They dont give u a range and say can collect anytime in that period right?,btohqsg
HDB BTO key collection deferment: you can defer your appointment for up to a month. You can apply to defer your HDB key collection date for up to one month. According to HDB: ‚Äúthose who need to change the appointment date should do so within one month from the date of the original appointment.,btohqsg
Otherwise  their flat application can be cancelled  and they will forfeit 5% of the purchase price.‚Äù,btohqsg
oh can choose which date to go down collect ?,btohqsg
I don't think can have many choices  I reckon HDB lets you chooses the date with limited option,btohqsg
own hdb home and still paying installment bank loan if I want to buy another new home so can sell old home away. Advise,btohqsg
however  you can try ballot despite MOP is not met lol,btohqsg
The application rate is insane. Good luck  guys.,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know why some houses in the HDB site put it‚Äôs available for SBF but when I went down to take a look at the unit  it was already under renovation or some unit have a bicycle lock on the metal gate,btohqsg
bicycle chain sounds like ah long repo ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Legit I not kidding haha. Some of the houses I‚Äôve seen so far has a bicycle lock on it.,btohqsg
did you go to the correct unit? lol,btohqsg
Repurchased flat according to HDB site,btohqsg
Example this flat shows up on SBF,btohqsg
but when we went there. It was already doing renovation,btohqsg
maybe someone else bought it liao? idk,btohqsg
I noticed those with bicycle lock is repurchase flat on SBF house. But does it mean anything ? Or HDB just lock it only that‚Äôs all?,btohqsg
Maybe they sell back and have to reinstate?,btohqsg
Maybe hdb just lock to be safe,btohqsg
Coz if its previously owned the previous owner can still have the keys,btohqsg
Repurchased flats are older flats that were sold and returned to the HDB for various reasons  such as the previous owners may have been unable to keep up with the payment  or a couple getting a divorce before they completed their Minimum Occupation Period of five years.,btohqsg
So  maybe hdb has to put bicycle lock before they change the lock?,btohqsg
so... what if a metal gate has nothing like a bicycle lock,btohqsg
Maybe hdb change lock alr? Idk,btohqsg
So far those house that I went and see that don‚Äôt have lock  according to the site is new,btohqsg
so that might be how they differential the differences,btohqsg
my colleague's family members balloted for tb 4r  mother and sis,btohqsg
still have cash proceeds from the sale of their tanjong pagar flat,btohqsg
my colleague has his own bto,btohqsg
he just told me his mum and sister applied together,btohqsg
If person is not yet PR and still hold LTVP  married with Singapore person. Can buy new BTO 3 room?,btohqsg
either 2r flexi BTO or resale,btohqsg
for resale  If SC is 21 years and older:¬†the non-citizen spouse must have a valid¬†Long Term Visit Pass¬†or¬†Work Pass¬†at time of application. The pass must¬†have a validity period¬†of at least 6 months from the date of issue.If SC is 35 years and older:¬†the non-citizen spouse must have a valid¬†Visit Pass¬†or¬†Work Pass. There is no requirement of a validity period.,btohqsg
for 2r flexi  SC must be 35 and older.¬†The non-citizen spouse must have a valid¬†Visit Pass¬†or¬†Work Pass.,btohqsg
sister single  they made $450k from their tiong bahru $290k flat  though the current might be sold at a loss of $50k  they thought why not try ballot for Tb,btohqsg
