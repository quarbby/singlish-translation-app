üìÆAsk Pika Nat Series #7üî≠Chinese stocks had a world of fun  see-sawing as investors navigated their way out of the often negative news from the domestic and international spheres. As a result  we have received numerous questions on our perspective of Chinese stocks; hence  the write up of this edition.Let's get into the details.ü¶ÅAloha  I am Alive!ü¶ïIt was a loud calling as Chinese stocks started the week trending higher  with Alibaba leading the game after the announcement on the reshuffled of key management. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) also announced tiny drips of stimulus to help protect the downside to economic expansions.Essentially  the policy stimulus aims to reduce reserves held by banks to help lower financing rates for companies that are struggling. In addition  it could be seen as a move by the Chinese government in managing the potential fallout of China's Evergrande. Indeed  the patient needs the pill.‚åõÔ∏èRisks remains intactüí°Two key risks continue to loom in the market  other than Covid-19  include the delisting voices by the US and China's ability to swim out of the Evergrande's debt problem.üíµ#1: Evergrande Debt Woesüí∞In its latest filing last Friday  it hints at the need to restructure its massive debt. The company faces a whopping $82.5 million payment due to offshore creditors. However  the policy stimulus by the Chinese government on Monday may help soften the blow of possible fallout as it would release around $188 billion liquidity into the financial system.Most striking is the company's acknowledgement that it had received demands of payment obligation of about $260 million and that there is no guarantee they will be able to payout this debt. While the government in Guangdong province had sent a risk management team to ensure the company's operationn sustainability  more is to be seen if there are direct handouts. The Chinese authorities hinted to the founder to use part of his wealth to shoulder the company's debt.Perhaps the best scenario would be an orderly restructuring in the company. Yet  the most pressing issue is the inability of the organization to shed away its assets at a pace that comforts the nerves of investors. If there is any indication  it could be more pain down the road.üïπ#2: Delisting by Didi Global (DIDI)üßØThis would be the focus area as investors wonder how the process would begin. It would be logical to see more fund managers shifting their exposure to Chinese markets by purchasing Hong Kong-listed shares.The cloudy outlook on how delisting would turn out means an overhang on Chinese stocks. As Pika World highlights  the economic playout in China has often been a political-economy state. When politics intertwine with the engines of private enterprises  one could be domestic  and another function is external such as the diplomatic boycott of the winter Olympics in China by the US.The simmering background tension has deterred investors from going full in with confidence into China  often seen as an attractive market of expansionary growth and capital gain.üíéOur Take on the Grand SchemeüíéRemaining invested in Chinese stocks is our stance. Nonetheless  even as China's macro environment has turned for the better with more policy stimulus  it is wise to maintain a vigilant outlook for more certainty and clarity  especially on the blueprint of delisting. And for retail investors  this might be a challenging route.Yet  as investors  we have the longevity of time and the hindsight of past episodes  which hopefully will be our worldly-wise torch towards the road ahead.Thank you for spending precious time reading this edition  and we will see you in the next one.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

Sitra market depth for reference. Once $0.018 cleared almost no resistance to $0.024/$0.025.Note: sometimes  all we need is one counter to take revenge for many losses. Maybe this could be the one ‚òùÔ∏è,btohqsg

Interesting on the 7th of Oct 2021  there was a big married deal at $0.016  approx 30 000 000 shares.Hence  I reckon $0.015/$0.016 almost risk free price to enter (for holders)Contra  also possible since the Controlling shareholder just did an off market deal at $0.025 yesterday. Considering that market is looking to bounce from the recent sell down  this one might just run since he is willing to buy at a big premium.Interesting times for Sitra I would say.They might just do a HGH/ Tritech.I hope this one will help to avenge my recent losses.DYODD,btohqsg
