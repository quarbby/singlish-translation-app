hi guys  what is the best HYSA after UOB one (first 100k)? needs to hold ard 150k,btohqsg
Hi all   do i qualify for this 3.6% if i sign up today and deposit 10000 fresh funds ? Does the 10000 count as incremental fund or thanks,btohqsg
"Ok i went to read the tnc and saw that insurance payment is not excluded from ""bonus interest A"" but wont earn rewards from the card itself",btohqsg
It’s comparing to Nov ADB tho. So if you don’t have the account then no,btohqsg
anyone attended/attending Adam Khoo event today? any good,btohqsg
What is the best card to pair with cardup/ipaymy for 10k mortgage loan? Currently have Citi Premiermiles but the 1.2mpd does not compensate for the 2.6% cardup fee. Many thanks in advance!,btohqsg
You can try ipaymy. They have promo for only 1.79% fee if pair with Visa card. Visa card can use DBS altitude for 1.3 mpd or DBS Visa Vantage for 1.5 mpd,btohqsg
How does the ipaymy works? I am curious,btohqsg
Similar to cardup. Use it to pay for bills using your CC and still can earn miles/cashback. These bills normally cannot use card to pay or does not earn rewards,btohqsg
Ok better understanding now  thank you,btohqsg
1.79 only for recurring right ? Can use for others ?,btohqsg
2.5k before cpf counts as hitting the 30k annual minimum right,btohqsg
Cannot. Only company giro salary can,btohqsg
Anyone is aware of the Qualifying Child Relief (QCR) and Parenthood Tax Rebate (PTR) sharing ? IRAS auto assigned 50% each parent. But my wife not working since pregnancy so she won’t utilize them. If I don’t do adjustment this year and take my 50% for tax rebate   and transfer her 50% to me next year and offset next years tax bill   does it work ?,btohqsg
In Malaysia  if merchant only accept cash or touch n go  which option is better if let’s say I only use amaze + CRMC?,btohqsg
U can assign 100% to urself also. Next time just pay income tax for your wife.,btohqsg
Hi all  is it true that after February there won’t be 6mpd for UOB lady card for your selected category and capped at 4mpd?,btohqsg
can only pray that they extend it which is unlikely,btohqsg
After February would it be 4mpd across all categories? Or is there a guide to read further on what are the exclusions?,btohqsg
yes 4mpd across all categories. same as how it works now just reduced to 4mpd,btohqsg
So that means only one selected category of the quarter can be 4mpd and the rest 0.4?,btohqsg
Milelion has a pretty detailed list on the card u can refer to,btohqsg
if u are holding the Platinum one yes  1 category up to $1k(4mpd) while the rest would be 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Anyone received rewards for previous Citi Plus Promo back in Aug/Sep 2023?,btohqsg
Also don't clock minimum spending on card,btohqsg
If i understood u correctly  u mean that no need to meet card's minimum spending right? Just clock enough ($500) to meet uob one account requirement,btohqsg
I meant it doesn't clock as eligible spend for minimum spending and cashback on card. Only clock for UOB One bonus interest spending.,btohqsg
Ya  actually i dont intend to use the CC for its benefits. Was considering using the One debit card instead. Also i am trying to see how can i allocate my spendings more effectively for UOB one and maybank plat visa,btohqsg

Anyone knows if uob one CC or debit card can be onboarded to samsung pay? And are the simplygo transactions posted on daily basis?,btohqsg
yes can add to samsung pay. If visa simplygo will be charged next day  posted 3 days after that. If mastercard  accumulate 5 days or min $15 whichever earlier before being charged,btohqsg
I think i will go for the evol card instead...from the website seems like able to use for samsung pay too,btohqsg
Yup. Counts as mobile contactless spend. The cashback is really good so don't just use it to clock the UOB One account bonus interest spend.,btohqsg
can I check if maybank platinum visa will work for following transactions?1) Foreign currency spend => will still give 3.33%?2) private hospitals like Gleneagles => I don't see exclusion (only government is excluded)  so is OK?3) Education spend not excluded?,btohqsg
It doesn’t say anything. Doesn’t say it’s excluded,btohqsg
Thanks a lot! Just checked  apparently the promo is only for property tax.,btohqsg
