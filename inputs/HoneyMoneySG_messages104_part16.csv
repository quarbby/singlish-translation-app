U hero ah.I keep $1 001 still.,btohqsg
Any reason why empty out for both May and June when June (assuming used as base month) should be sufficient for the upcoming earmark promo (if any)?,btohqsg
"Hahaha I also emptied to $0 🌚 I still have 1 or 2 months left on the ""first 6 months"" 🤪Now all in HSBC EGA.",btohqsg
Hi all. Anyone knows if citirewards carries any exclusions for klook spending? (Ie much like hsbc revolution)?,btohqsg
Yes. There are exclusion clause in TnC.,btohqsg
Because Uob one at 4% pa for $150k isn’t really that great,btohqsg
Withdraw all out at the end of May and transfer it somewhere else. Only paired with the promo then worth it,btohqsg
But musical chairs very troublesome. Have to find alternative after one month,btohqsg
Hi guys  I signed up for 2 credit cards with priority pass access. How can I ensure that I am able to use the visits separately in order to maximise the number of visits?,btohqsg
each card has their own login  so its 2x per account,btohqsg
I see  the priority pass (PP) account is tagged to my email address too right? Is it of any concern if 2 PP accounts is tagged to a single email,btohqsg
Or do I need a separate email for each PP account/app?,btohqsg
perfectly fine but the usernames need to be diff,btohqsg
not sure if mine is also to the same email but i think so  no issues,btohqsg
Few years ago  I got it around Aug  until I keep chasing Iras 🥹,btohqsg
You forget... 100k stuck on 1st May  1 day alone equates to 3k+ MAB. How I wish I can go into negative balance. Lol,btohqsg
"Likely June MAB will be used for the next round of ""dropping pheonix"" promotion. 😉",btohqsg
Nope. I withdrew on 30th April already to $1 001 because I kept $103 500 in April for 29 days.,btohqsg
Anybody withdraw from ibkr before? Usually how long it takes for money to bank in? Its been 4-5 days and no money come in yet after my withdrawal request,btohqsg
Same day for IBKR llcT+1 for IBKR sgThis refers to sgd.,btohqsg
Then its been so long sia. I contact them and ask,btohqsg
Thanks for this. Just checked my dbs cc bill and got giro line. They will deduct on due date  not when statement is generated.,btohqsg
Was hoping someone have a sample of this and just nice you sent 🤣Because DBS send me email say HSBC rejected my GIRO form  but HSBC side say they approved my GIRO already,btohqsg
Anyone encountered this? Has been like that since yesterday...,btohqsg
No issue for me  just logged in,btohqsg
