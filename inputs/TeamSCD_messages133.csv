Then when kena covid I moved the tv into another room with the xbox,btohqsg
That was the end of the rig,btohqsg
I only got The Crew which is freeAnd i didn't even buy a wheel for thatThat's why i go suntec CPCM play 6RR,btohqsg
I had the idea of getting it working in VR,btohqsg
But so far lazy to do it,btohqsg
That's 1 sick set up that my room couldn't fit,btohqsg
I'm thinking in VR will use less space,btohqsg
But driving in VR can get you very sick...,btohqsg
I haven't tried with the seat  but last time just clamp on table  you will feel it the moment to crash into a wall,btohqsg
Mine still the old quest 1,btohqsg
I wanted to buy WMMT6RR machine back home recently,btohqsg
Oculus quest new update  break the pc VR... It wont connect now,btohqsg
Ya  i just got new cable wanna try den it wont connect anymore... Old cable oso same,btohqsg
I remember last time can use virtual desktop or something,btohqsg
I use oculus link... Virtual desktop i dunno,btohqsg
There's a software you can use to connect over wifi rather then the cable,btohqsg
I never tried in more then a year,btohqsg
My friend could use it to play half life,btohqsg
Maybe virtual desktop still working... Oculus link all not working,btohqsg
You drove too fast ah ? hahahaha,btohqsg

Last time i get the f1 wheel oso  nv use for very long... Only when f1 22 come out den start using again,btohqsg
Last time use logitech g920... Den my dog chew the cable  so damn angry,btohqsg
I had all the bits and pieces already so didn't really spend,btohqsg
Spare laptopEgpuFree tvSteering wheel and pedals,btohqsg
So made sense to get the seat,btohqsg
But when laptop died so did my interest,btohqsg
Its liddat de... Sometime spoil  no mood liao,btohqsg
Now I'm thinking make the chair into like a relaxing lounge chair,btohqsg
When got money then can renovate the room,btohqsg

I think the fc3s also went up for 488k afterwards,btohqsg
What is that orange car even LOL,btohqsg
@BOBBYCWJwants to buy a Rx8. He needs advice.,btohqsg
I viewed 2 rx8  after test drive the first one the engine was 0-10 hot  but the 2nd one was 8-10 hot. Please adviceüôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
I mean the warmest of the engine when I open the hood. 0-10 is how warm it is  so the first one i tested was not hot at all when I open the hood  compared to the 2nd one which was 8-10 the warmest was very hot,btohqsg
Like when some cars u open the hood u can feel the engine how come so hot but the 2nd car i viewed its like quite hot   n the 1st car no hotness at all  so I'm not sure which is normalüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
But this is super hot like 8 over 10ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Should I go for the hot deü§î cuz not hot also seems wrong to meü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
The 1st rx8 i viewed the engine 0 nosie also  for the 2nd have abit nosie,btohqsg
Best is check though before commit,btohqsg
Maybe got oil cooler and upsized radiator so more cool?,btohqsg
Depend if the driver drive to let you view or the car is park fo long time,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsMocrOIPI8@KLZH1999And Taniguchi and DK says NC MX5 is the best!,btohqsg
How durable thisWork horse‚Ä¶ owner told meKs abit factory say 40k change ATF he 20k changeEngine oil 6-7k changeI‚Äôm also doing same 20k ATFEO me depend if wack NSH come back only change,btohqsg
@ishengjiedont need your kidney   probablyur heart üòè,btohqsg
This is the most interesting measurement ever lol,btohqsg
Both no obd or defi gauge?,btohqsg
If concern is the cooling  what radiator are they using? Stock? Is the coolant hose changed recently?,btohqsg
For a stock rx8  casual driving should not go above 88 while on the move. During spirited driving above 4k rpm u expect 95 to 100,btohqsg
If it hits 105 while on the move something is wrong. Could be coolant leak or thermostat issue,btohqsg
Anyone selling fender signal lights for lancer ex?,btohqsg
Back in SG  back at workshop,btohqsg
Any good and affordable car wash near lor ah soo? Sent my rabbits for grooming and I got nth to do üò≠,btohqsg
Miata really must wink then got the feel,btohqsg
I think the 2nd car is stock wor,btohqsg
How to check for this wor,btohqsg
Depends if the car has a defi meter installed,btohqsg
Some will use a defi zd like this,btohqsg
But as for the advised temperature perhaps@chloetherx8can guide you better. As there are many factors that can affect,btohqsg
That's where the zd comes in,btohqsg
But saving up for them one by one,btohqsg
I prefer the old sch gaugesüòÇ,btohqsg
If I install a gauge  maybe will be afr,btohqsg
ZD screen too small for old uncleüòÇ,btohqsg
For temperature which meter should I see wor,btohqsg
You will want to take note of the water temp and oil temp,btohqsg
Btw what is the healthy de,btohqsg
So if water is too hot above 9 means ü§îü§îü§î,btohqsg
For my Honda  around 80 to 90 for water temp. But this can go down if things like the thermostat  radiator has been changed.,btohqsg
For oil temp around 90 is a good temp to run the engine. Those with oil coolers installed can see as low as 80 degrees for the oil,btohqsg
Mine the oil temps will run between 90 to 105...,btohqsg
Just now i said those number lor,btohqsg
U shouldnt cross 100 during test drive  which is more like a track temp,btohqsg
If u maintain high rpm for a couple minutes u will see 100-105,btohqsg
Anything above 105 u risk damaging your coolant seals,btohqsg
@BOBBYCWJyour the one that day in the stream rsz right?,btohqsg
I got blackout one for evo  should be can fit if you want it,btohqsg
So even if I get rx8 I can't always run fast on road de?,btohqsg
If u are running high rpm for over 60s you arent in singapore,btohqsg
Also  in about 15 s u will be at 200 already,btohqsg
So if I get this I normal slow drive in sg won't be an issue right,btohqsg
Like slow drive ltr engine have issue,btohqsg
Unless I keep go msia speed then will be an issue?,btohqsg
Cannot always slow... Must every now and then rev up,btohqsg
If you're looking for a car that looks cute then yeah.. Otherwise everyone gem after the NA is a better car overall.,btohqsg
Ummmm slow is a subjective word. Lets just say if you‚Äôre not speeding overheating is not going to be an issue.,btohqsg
If if u go msia  gear 4 climb to 170 and then gear up to 6  your rpm will rest arnd3500-4500,btohqsg
Ultimately its a coe car  get a mechanic / ws to look at it,btohqsg
NB as NA with no pop ups,btohqsg
It also uses the same 1.6L,btohqsg
Cars in sg forever not budget,btohqsg
If test drive 1 round like this ok?,btohqsg
Go workshop n check before buying,btohqsg
I think the oil haven't reach its peak,btohqsg
But I would think if the previous owner got install defi  he would monitor the temps,btohqsg
Idk Haylee say in the group,btohqsg
Today ask Abt it  same day confirmed,btohqsg
He have been viewing car for v long le.,btohqsg
Hope ur car don‚Äôt lower. So can join me and@PilotAviator21,btohqsg
