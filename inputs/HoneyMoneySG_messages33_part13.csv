hi  guys. i have amex tcb card and pay the hawker center with amex app qr code. may i ask if this is earning 3% rebate( im a new cardholder,btohqsg
U mean the source is misleading?,btohqsg
Sorry  read your wording wrongly. Yes  if your taxable income is 8k and u topup 8k to reduce it to 0 your income is not taxable,btohqsg
E.g. if I make $100k a year  isn‚Äôt $100k my taxable income?,btohqsg
There's a tax calculator spreadsheet that IRAS provides. You can actually use that to calculate your payable taxes after all the tax reliefs.,btohqsg
It saves you a lot of headache from guessing actually,btohqsg
Taxable income is total income minus reliefs and deductables. By contributing 8k to your SRS  it's equivalent of 8k of relief. It means that 8k is not subjected to tax at your highest tax bracket.,btohqsg
It does not mean you pay 8k less tax.,btohqsg
1.5 weeks for me. Applied this month,btohqsg
For simple illustration  If your taxable income is $100 000 at 10% tax rate  you need to pay $10 000 tax.If you contribute $12 000 to SRS  your taxable income become $88 000. Your tax will be $8 800 assuming your tax rate is still 10%.,btohqsg
Omg so much simpler now  thank you so much :)),btohqsg
Paying SP bill giro with Uob One card count as part of $500 minimum spent?,btohqsg
Yes. This is what I have been doing,btohqsg
Hey all  am interested in opening a OCBC 360 account  didn‚Äôt have any high interest savings account before.My salary comes in on the 28th of every month  would like to ask if the salary credited to the account can also fulfil the $500  assuming I haven‚Äôt withdrawn from the account  or do I need to put in a $500 maybe at the start of the month before the salary comes in?,btohqsg
its calculated by ADB. You need to increase ur ADB by $500 as compared to prev month,btohqsg
Is the increase in $500 only checked from the previous month balance? Am thinking if the first month there is 30K inside  then the next month I have to withdraw money out to 20K  would the ADB in the following month be 20.5K?Know that by doing this  the month where withdrawal is done should have lower interest  but am more interested in the month where the saving picks up again.,btohqsg
Anyone on vivifi here? Where do u charge your bills to? There is no online portal and bills seems to be recurring so I use uob One for now  but I was thinking of moving away from uob one and am wondering if there is a better card to charge to?,btohqsg
Correct  but you don't really need to withdraw money and just increase your ADB by $500. Salary credit counts towards itE.g. If your salary is credited on 28  and you have 30k in the bank  your ADB is (30k x 28 and 30k + salary for 2 or 3 days divided by 30 or 31So first day of next month your ADB will be 30k + salary which should be higher than $500,btohqsg
Between 2 statement dates to calculate ADB difference  does it include the older statement date‚Äôs interest amount that is earned?,btohqsg
Anyone has any idea how the monthly average balance is calculated for uob one account?,btohqsg
yes  basically any amount of balance in the account. so from the date interest is credited till end of the month,btohqsg
Ok got it  thanks so much!,btohqsg
Vivifi should have a website u sign in to add your cc,btohqsg
Yes  but which card to use best is the question,btohqsg
Muvo Telco I usually don't use real cc card I just use a virtual card like grab or revo,btohqsg
Revo works? I wasn't sure if considered as online coz the card is auto deducted every month,btohqsg
I think he's referring to Revolut  not HSBC Revolution card,btohqsg
Hey guysDoes anyone here using any sort of credit card management app? How do you make sure your not missing any payment ? Any suggestions ?Thanks,btohqsg
Does it mean that liquid pay is useless and can delete already?,btohqsg
Does HSBC/WWMC earn points from purchasing Amazon Gift Card fromAmazon.sg?,btohqsg
I make sure all my cc‚Äôs statement dates are roughly the same so the due dates are around the same time. For me all my ccs‚Äô due dates are around the first week of the month. So I have built the habit to pay all my ccs at last weekend of the month.,btohqsg
You can use shopback to buy amazon gift card vouchers to earn some % cashback in shopback. WWMC gives 4mpd for shopback since it is considered online purchase.,btohqsg
Thanks  I suppose HSBC Revo won't be eligible for points when purchase voucher from shopback?,btohqsg
It depends on what MCC shopback uses for Amazon vouchers but I'm not sure of the MCC. If it falls under HSBC Revo MCC whitelist then it's ok,btohqsg
Can anyone advise how much tax relief one will enjoy when topping up $8000 to own MA account?,btohqsg
8k off your taxable income then u see which bracket is your assessment income,btohqsg
Which card should I use to pay for this course?,btohqsg
Citi smrt works for CSC@Changi booking(>$1000)? Or is it considered Travel related?,btohqsg
Hi! Which credit card would you recommend for utilities  online shopping (including buying flight tickets  booking hotel) for a total spending of ~500/600$ per month. Thanks!,btohqsg

Any card that reward for mcc 5815,btohqsg
Anyone know does webull have a recurring / auto trade function? I wanna do dca investing but don't want to do it manually.,btohqsg
Hey@kelvintaninvestany recommendation on how not to forget to pay credit card payments ? Any app to remind or? üòÄ,btohqsg
Using XNAP with uob Evo through Apple Pay consider online spending ?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not Kelvin and I really like Kelvin‚Äôs YouTube videos as much as I love Chris‚Äô.However I always always have a bad habit of applying interbank GIRO all my credit cards except one. As soon as I have the card number  I just send the interbank GIRO form. That sole outlier is the Trust Card due on the 2nd every month üòÇAlso I keep a record on all my cards repayment* date and pay by that day.*statement date if you need to buy a house or ‚Äúcar‚Äù whatever with loans ü§î,btohqsg
Hm  i guess u can set a recurring event on google calendar.I just apply giro deduction for all my cards,btohqsg
Dont think its a bad habit tho. It saves time n avoids not paying on time. If u want to check the bill  can always set a reminder to check,btohqsg
Is it through that we can only cash top up spouse‚Äôs MA for tax relief  only if her annual income is less than $4 per annum?,btohqsg
