text,group
and can get A during tests,btohqsg
Those people are the scariest ü§£,btohqsg
i mug 8hrs a day with my friends,btohqsg
sp is the best sch right,btohqsg
is sp optometry or np optometry better,btohqsg
if u rly aiming to go uni and get degree,btohqsg
just get into a relevant course,btohqsg
where u can get best gpa,btohqsg
Wait which poly got the most mugging culture,btohqsg
as long as ur diploma is relevant and gpa is high enough  uni dont care which diploma u specifically took,btohqsg
if u get a diploma w merit (top 10%),btohqsg
they let u choose any course,btohqsg
Mugging culture highly depends on your cohort also,btohqsg
if next cohort no mugging culture also no mugging culture,btohqsg
But last time compared to now  quite a handful of poly students will aim to go uni,btohqsg
I ‚Äòve yet to come across one.,btohqsg
You need to go touch grass then,btohqsg
my friends in poly literallt study all the time,btohqsg
We ‚Äòre in banking yet none of the people mug.,btohqsg
even on his holiday still studying,btohqsg
If the diploma is linked to a high-tier uni major  chances are you will find mugger,btohqsg
mugging is more towards engineering ppl,btohqsg
bcos we are pen and papwr,btohqsg
the course im in  biomedical engineering,btohqsg
I only know Banking students like to do work last min and submit.,btohqsg
you will find that sort of people everywhere,btohqsg
in jc u will see ppl not studying also lmao,btohqsg
Took us just two days to finish a groupwork.,btohqsg
life is just unfair like thay,btohqsg
There will always be someone better than you,btohqsg
u work so hard only to realize someone exceeds u.,btohqsg
That's why you work hard to improve yourself,btohqsg
and they probably studied 1/10 u do,btohqsg
not to match up to others,btohqsg
that friend of mine with 85RP,btohqsg
he watched every world cup match so far,btohqsg
Match up to others is honestly quite stressful.,btohqsg
Later he 85rp go out play soccer,btohqsg
Lol. Is it he absorb quite well like üßΩ.,btohqsg
Haha yea some people are like that,btohqsg
That's why when parents say why so and so can do it and you cannot,btohqsg
Some people are just born diff.,btohqsg
I always slack throughout the sem then last min mug during finals and midterms,btohqsg
I got a good come back but then I might get disowned,btohqsg
"""Why pm lee can be pm you cannot""",btohqsg
"""why steve jobs can be ceo you cannot""",btohqsg
"""why my friend can travel 10 time a year you cannto bring us""",btohqsg
u need people to vote for u.,btohqsg
Your parents and mine like reverse,btohqsg
My parents only got Os so can't compare,btohqsg
they were prepared for 230+ cos I didn‚Äôt study,btohqsg
even though PSLE-wise I scored higher than my siblings  it's only mediocre at best,btohqsg
Thing is I've already been showing very obvious signs that I'm struggling in math yet they expect 230 ü§î,btohqsg
my mum went poly then just worked all the way,btohqsg
then did some masters equivalent for accounting,btohqsg
Going poly to study considered quite upz during my parents era,btohqsg
coz a lot people can't afford,btohqsg
at this point go also like no point,btohqsg
The oldest person to graduate was 98.,btohqsg
you only go at that age if you just want to,btohqsg
If go now is just for self-fulfillment bah,btohqsg
yes if you discount that ITE has a really bad stigma,btohqsg
Yea ITE cert can go out do technical job already,btohqsg
ITE is not as bad as what some people think it is.,btohqsg
If you do biz dev in science,btohqsg
So that one is more for Biz school.,btohqsg
my gf is econs in uni,btohqsg
So Poly econs is better and more suited for Uni?,btohqsg
I mean the point of econs is to alr be of use in work,btohqsg
Ig it makes sense by a bit.,btohqsg
Poly will only cover Micro / Macro only,btohqsg
Micro and macro is so little damn,btohqsg
And some courses will not have Macro,btohqsg
Ya. Is not even scratching the surface,btohqsg
That‚Äôs true of many poly courses anyway,btohqsg
Y1 to Y3 poly is equivalent to Y1 uni chem,btohqsg
some polys don't even cover that extensively,btohqsg
Yea uni really just condenses everything into 2 sems,btohqsg
Idk about poly but almost the entire H2 physics syllabus was in my y1 sem 1,btohqsg
Hmm for me our y3 chem stuff is not covered in H2,btohqsg
in H3 have  at least the old version I think,btohqsg
Then the diploma wanted to revamp and remove that y3 chem  module in favour for longer internship coz my internship was only 6 weeks,btohqsg
Yea it's things like NMR and MS,btohqsg
The logic was the longer internship is for ease in finding job  not for going uni,btohqsg
The lecturers wanted our feedback after that,btohqsg
Literally told them you can't remove y3 chem if not it's going to be very tough  and how can you tell STEM kids not to go uni,btohqsg
"Y3 organic chem lecturer was like telling his collegues ""see I told you guys already""",btohqsg
Yea H3 physics covers a few more bits of my sem 1  specifically the modern physics parts,btohqsg
I mean mine is hard science so like,btohqsg
Some of first two sems is purely to help non H2 physics people catch up,btohqsg
They teach chair conformation all those,btohqsg
fair but i also know my friends say other schs cram what learn in 2 years into 1 sem,btohqsg
Their workload is also the highest,btohqsg
Like even if they have more guidance  the amount they need to get done within each period is insane,btohqsg
I think almost every mod has some project,btohqsg
But SUTD is a specialised school so can‚Äôt really compare with any uni,btohqsg
their focus is on industry relevance over anything,btohqsg
That is interesting. Probs has to do with smaller cohort tbh,btohqsg
Sounds not bad. Besides   it ‚Äòs very near to my house.,btohqsg
There are more guns in the US than people,btohqsg
i knew the us was bad...but damn this takes it to a whole another level,btohqsg
I wish i can say i did,btohqsg
but all these edusaves are like way outta my grasp alrd,btohqsg
Then a letter came to me,btohqsg
I was only class exco for 2 years and cca exco,btohqsg
What‚Äôs your leadership position in sec sch?,btohqsg
I wanna know how they pick,btohqsg
Not sth i would be proud of but alright,btohqsg
Like not a councillor or something,btohqsg
woah you're so cool and edgy and different üò≥üò≥ü•µü•µüò®üò®üòüüò©üò´ü§™üòãü•≥üòäüòéüòçüòã,btohqsg
I wanted to be a council for the points,btohqsg
I can honestly say  once u grad all these things dont matter,btohqsg
Points make a diff for your o level points,btohqsg
And your o levels points determines what course you can go to‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I mean you don‚Äôt necessarily have to work at where u study la,btohqsg
as long as you get in can already,btohqsg
then after that you just move on,btohqsg
I studied business  hotel operations  and currently Communications,btohqsg
My school testimonial mentioned i was class monitor (When i was never)...I also got a last minute EXCO position in my CCA created by my teacher just so i could get 1 point after 5 years of being in the same CCA.,btohqsg
I was the assistant to the assistant of the logistic officer,btohqsg
eh@cyphrwslike u sia(hopefully i didnt wake u up),btohqsg
why does one need to conform,btohqsg
I think I gotta thank my classmates for being international students,btohqsg
And gave me a chance to rise and get $$,btohqsg
The international students are the one that made up about 1/2 of our class,btohqsg
And they‚Äôre the studious one cos they paid a lot for school fees,btohqsg

i think literally every other cca had more purpose,btohqsg
the npcc would always flirt with the girl guides...then you got the scouts just constructing unsafe structures all around the school  then the ncc would be scolding the npcc,btohqsg

"them climate activist....out there spray painting  throwing food trying to involve people in ""Saving the environment""...its honeslty too far gone",btohqsg
SIngapore is a chairty in itself..,btohqsg
We accept funds from other nations  then use some of them to benefit our society and give some to poorer nations,btohqsg
