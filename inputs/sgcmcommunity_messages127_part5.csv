Has anyone leased a car from Royal Motor Granduer? Thoughts on their 0% downpayment and 800/mth instalments?,btohqsg
Not sure but I like carro,btohqsg
800 per month? that's cheaper than buying a car paying the monthly,btohqsg
From  that's the keyword. You won't get 0 down 767 monthly if you ask them. Just a gimmick to attract attention.,btohqsg
i rmb once they promote car monthly 700,btohqsg
I got ask before . They just want you to go down to the showroom . Then keep persuading you to sign ✍️ n the dotted line . Which my friend blindly did,btohqsg
Hopefully your friend is doing okay with it,btohqsg
u can go down  just read TNC carefully,btohqsg
My friend get away with it . They can’t do anything ….,btohqsg
They will tell you the amount is for the normal follow . And you want 0% down payment   then you got to pay x % interest rate,btohqsg
Or lease their vehicle then get to redeem over after x yrs and become yours or you get to choose another car .,btohqsg
Because of the mas rule  if 700 only then dp 50% cannot run one,btohqsg
Does it makes sense to spent like 1.32 litres of fuel oil for 22km journey?,btohqsg
Recently I did something clever . I think so,btohqsg
I created multiple account for shell app to enjoy the 22% discount,btohqsg
Oh okok. I thot I was seeing things,btohqsg
