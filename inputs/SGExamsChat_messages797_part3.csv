And she seem to be targeting me n my brother,btohqsg
Firstly she keep nagging at me to dress properlySecondly last week she at kl and in her words â€˜specially requestedâ€™ us to visit my grandma  then now complaining we not caring and no one go visit. Every time i said i busy she be like â€˜u think only u busy is it?â€™Bruh like does she even know / bother to find out what im gg throughâ€¦,btohqsg
And she is one who dun accept no as an answer,btohqsg
My dad also agrees but all he told me is â€˜some people are like thatâ€™,btohqsg
Then that time i fed-up didnt reply her message  she spam the gc w 50+ messages,btohqsg
Oh yea btw this is the eye condition i have,btohqsg

Ummm for portfolio yes it is required as u need to put in all your competition and achievements,btohqsg
I think u should try asking your school about it,btohqsg
U might get bashed foe saying that out loud,btohqsg

Sounds like your life just has another hurdle  it will take time but eventually you will overcome it,btohqsg
I think u got issue setting boundaries. That line that once crossed should and must have actions for retaliation,btohqsg
The disciplinarian in my family is my mom  she's the one that sent me to counseling  she's the one that send me to tuition  she's the one that always scold people in the house.My dad like you said just goes with the flow  in the last decade. He has not gotten angry once,btohqsg
The problem is that the adults will back each other up and then things happen,btohqsg
Lol actually same here  but then i love how my parents downplay my health issues,btohqsg
Things happen which affects your life?,btohqsg
Then my parents be like â€˜u need to know how to say noâ€™ but then again they are not giving a soln to the problem coz there are ppl who dun accept no,btohqsg
They downplay because that was the environment they grew up in. During their time  mental health was always treated as a situation where people just wanted to skive/skip work/do less work because they had a reason to,btohqsg
As in it was also affecting my physical health but they just dun give a damn,btohqsg
As such  they have brought that mindset through their whole life. And are so adamant in someway or rather they are right  they have no reason to change it,btohqsg
Then i realised all of it can be linked,btohqsg
If you looked through the speeches that the govt have during their time  literally every other speech was about pushing their limits and doing more than they can for the next generation.You don't hear our ministers these days say to work your ass off anymore  that was what lky rallied the nation to do in the 1980s-1990s,btohqsg
what universe am i living in,btohqsg
Thing is like it or not you are also an adult. U have the prerogative but have yet to excerise the power itself. Power is taken not given  at some point you have to make that decision for yourself  can't let anyone make that for you.,btohqsg
only my brother can rebel  simple things like not replying coz someone piss me off  i get scolded,btohqsg
I got a feeling your brother scolded your mother b4 alr,btohqsg
Like really straightup scold or did something that honestly make your mother realise she could no longer entertain your brother's shinenigans,btohqsg
