🚀Pika World Markets Update - 3 Jan 2024🚀Technology stocks made the stocks fall on Tuesday as traders pare back the odds of massive rate cuts. This is because of a rising Treasury yield and a spike in VIX  which reflects heightened volatility and downward pressure on stocks.There were some corporate news that drove sentiments.🎲Apple's downgrade hit the market.🎯Barclay downgraded Apple on the concern that it is losing its iPhone market share  accounting for about half of the company's revenue.This bodes poorly for the company as investors are concerned that other products such as Apple Watch  AirPods  and accessories  including service performance  could be impacted. After all  Apple products are all about the ecosystem.There is doubt about the performance of the iPhone 15  and that fear is translated into the possibility of weak demand for the iPhone 16  which is expected to be released in the fall. The analyst from Barclay also noted possible weak demand in other product categories  such as the Mac  iPad and wearables. Most critically  they expect that the services business growth is likely to be at most 10% this year.🍎Falling market shares for premium category.🔑It comes at a challenging time for Apple  where the macroeconomic environment in China has not improved substantially while it has to fence off competition from domestic brands such as Huawei.According to a finding by Counterpoint Research  Apple's dominant share in the premium smartphone category has fallen from 75% to 71%. In comparison  Samsung increased 1% from 16% to 17%  with improvement seen in Huawei  jumping 2% in market share to hit 5%.So  where is the growth for the day? It's the value stocks. They are flourishing during the trading days while growth stocks like those in the technology took the beating  reversing a preference seen in 2023.📖What's on the menu today?🥁At 11 pm  we will receive the ISM manufacturing PMI and Process for Dec. At the same time  the JOLTs Job opening for November will be released  which will be critical for us to see if the Fed is correct that the labour market could cool off  with its lag effects of monetary tightening policy.It is on 3 Jan  Wednesday  9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Markets are likely to stay volatile for the first two weeks as we have major economic data and are constantly exploring ways to pare down our positions to a more comfortable level  as yesterday's drop has erased a considerable sum of our ammunition.We hope you have a splendid journey to work and in school.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
