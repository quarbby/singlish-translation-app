woohoo just in time for me to renew :),btohqsg
Can afford to renew good already,btohqsg
from buying and selling experience during the coid  i believe this cycle is distorted,btohqsg
pls step down since obviously u have nothing new to add,btohqsg
most cars drove less 10k per year due to wfh,btohqsg
so the COR price trend...add 2-3 years should be right,btohqsg
so if COE i slower in 2016  add 2 years,btohqsg
imho just renew 5 years just nice buy new car in 2028,btohqsg

Any PI sell yaris hatchback AWD?,btohqsg
so nice i drove in japan,btohqsg
European car of the year 2021  just like golf  the reputation is no frill,btohqsg
Golf is one of the most popular cars in Germany.,btohqsg
Actually its sad they will end the Golf series,btohqsg
I think its the most sold car for Volkswagen in the world,btohqsg
The Golf is to VW what the Corolla is to Toyota,btohqsg
Tiguan sold more units than golf lol,btohqsg
Victim of the sad trend of everyone moving on to SUVs,btohqsg
Nope  golf actually all time best seller for VW,btohqsg
All time bestseller until recently got dethroned by Tiguan yea,btohqsg
As the trend is shifting towards SUVs,btohqsg
Annual sales maybe. All-time definitely not.,btohqsg
But the Tiguan has a long way to go to reach the total units of golf sold,btohqsg
All time is not a very good metric though,btohqsg
Is like saying Muhammad Ali is the GOAT of boxing  but in this era the sport is very different from back then,btohqsg
It shows history and heritage of a brand,btohqsg
btw. even more knowing that the overall car market back then is much smaller.,btohqsg
The best metric would be picking a specific market as well tbh,btohqsg
anyway  my point is: The VW Golf is a great car and has been a benchmark for many OEMs in that segment.,btohqsg
Sorry bruh Lotus and Mini are British icons but one is now Chinese owned the other is German,btohqsg
Because some markets get tiguans and don't get golfs,btohqsg
History and heritage don't mean much these days,btohqsg
I correct myself  it doesn't mean much unless my Honda civic shitbox from 20 years ago is selling at 16k depre,btohqsg
Car tyre kena nail. Usually how much do tyre shops charge to remove?,btohqsg
If already flat or leaking air don't drive,btohqsg
Call for on site service they patch on the spot,btohqsg
If you drive will damage the tyre,btohqsg
