Got it. A lot of these come at night when there is no other order. Seemed weird,btohqsg
nextime accept order see the floor high ready comeout  and better cancel bro if high level,btohqsg
Anyone been doing Lalamove with one their rental partners TribeCar/GetGo etc?,btohqsg
If you want to rent  I suggest don‚Äôt use GetGo. Really not worth it  unless you truly know the roads inside out. If you truly wanna rent to try and do LLM  can try using Shariot. I dunno about TribeCar  coz I have never used TribeCar before. üòÖ,btohqsg
Thanks for the insight dude  I wouldn't have to ask if the LLM pages actually stated the discounts and the individual prices,btohqsg
How much do you pay for Shariot?,btohqsg
Shariot is hourly based with peak & off peak charges. But distance and petrol charges are born by you. So you have the liberty of choosing what petrol you want to pump and what route you wanna take for your deliveries. Otherwise  my suggestion is rent outside where the rates are better. üòÖ,btohqsg
Thanks mate  anyone else got more info on rental please share üôè,btohqsg
Just happy to share my inputs. Just a little heads up  now I see more PRs on the road. Just a couple of days ago  I picked up an order at Robertson Quay  and I spotted an Ang Moh on the app.,btohqsg
Every1 doing  that's y order less n price low,btohqsg
Increase job volume to jb area ü§£ü§£ just a joke,btohqsg
DIU! Just one to send one job need to get passport chopped.,btohqsg
Any driver tried grabexpress? Is it better than lalamove?,btohqsg
I've been thinking how to out these fellows  make LLM ban them. Thought to accept these orders when I'm resting at home already  then highlight to LLM that the account is trying to scam us  so they will ban them. Theoretically  eventually will have no more right? What do you think?,btohqsg
You can prank one.. but you cant prank an army,btohqsg
There can't be that many of them doing this right? Every ban is an account/effort wasted for them permanently. They have to create another account  maybe use a new phone number?,btohqsg
I'm just worried they bite back  get me banned. üò≠,btohqsg
I do this sometimes actually. One time I even swiped completed then they cursed me through chat. Then I got refund on commission through support.But most of the times I just accept then don't do anything.,btohqsg
Mostly big scammer organisations. Infinite number 1 lah  that's y llm also won't bother do anything üòÇ,btohqsg
I agree there can be a lot of them. But I'm sure there are a lot more of us... At least 100 good people to 1 scammer? The way I see these scammers: they're like flies  cockroaches  parasites. If you don't deal with them  it's basically just an encouragement to them.LLM has limited resources  and their real job is to deal with legit rider/driver/customer/platform issues. Can't blame them for not having time to shoo away pests  until they create a problem  eg make the news.,btohqsg
some time the llm driver also a scammer also i guess pukimak fellow no money ready purposely book at his area place to let other llm driver get busy from his place so he can get another order his mother cb poor thing,btohqsg
I just managed to get one of them banned. Score one for the good guys. üòä,btohqsg
All within 10 minutes. Just accept the order  then contact LLM CS to say customer not responsive. Don't even need to say much else,btohqsg
I dun understand how that works for him. But that also didn't make him a scammer... At most an evil person  or a prankster. Scammers are professionals and are beyond evil,btohqsg
most of the scammers they dont give details or reponding answering calls be carefull and vigilant guys,btohqsg
üî´Vanessahas been kicked ‚Äî the only way to get this user back is for admins to manualy unban in chat settings.Voters who chose to kick:@uber_stud_87 @LegendaryFmk @ZunkTM BigHead28 @MallGrabberInfo on moving from üá∫üá¶ to üá®üá¶,btohqsg
Is it just me  or are there much fewer LLM orders this afternoon? And those few orders are getting snatched up like within seconds,btohqsg
Even lousy orders are getting snatched up,btohqsg
I think school holiday and also too many drivers..... maybe supply over demand also...,btohqsg
Early bird catches the worm. Shitty fares still get drivers. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Is this a channel for looking for driver to get delivery,btohqsg
Others have tried  not sure how many responded,btohqsg
Can always try your luck here  to see if any drivers respond?,btohqsg
He's so irritated by me that his newly created accounts are named after me. I'm a marked man now,btohqsg
anyone joined LLM‚Äôs daily fixed orders before? is it really like what they claim  min earnings and zero commission?,btohqsg
Guys anyone ever kena this??I have submitted the feedback  I put because there is another order and it is heavily rain,btohqsg
Then they will say u shouldn't have taken the job if u have another order,btohqsg
They will say anything to blame the driver.,btohqsg
So what will happen next  they will deduct our wallet or suspend ACC?,btohqsg
I got this at least 3 times. Only the first time partially my fault  so they deducted about $7  half of what the food cost that spilled. The part that was my fault was that I accepted an order that was too big to fit in my bike... His fault was that he never pack the liquid stuff properly for motorcycle transport.So I thought the settlement was pretty fair. Except the guy gave me such a bad rating that my driver rating got demoted to Fair  it took me 3 months to build it back to Good.The other two  I got good reasons for being late... One was Buka Puasa time pick up at Jln Sultan  super confusing place  and I got a minor accident and had bruises to show for it. Told them I had to clean up the blood before proceeding. I even told them I stacked order (they can see it anyway) before the accident  because both going same direction. Proof with picture of fresh bruises and bandages.The last case was the pick up delayed  and I duly kept in touch with recipient to update on lateness. Proof with SMS messages  but couldn't claim waiting fees because I didn't call customer before proceeding.,btohqsg
Bottom line is...1. Follow their rules (the CS will always nag at you about these  but the rules are actually sensible  even if inconvenient). Be ready with text and picture proof2. Serve your customers well3. Tell a good story for the feedback formHope my sharing helps,btohqsg
A lot of locals aren‚Äôt street smart,btohqsg
all desperate for money to pay up maintaines and this llm app abusing it  that why will happen,btohqsg
