Hi experts  does anybody know is SimplyGo transactions (Bus/MRT) are included in AMEX Krisflyer Ascend credit card to qualify for 1.2miles/dollar? TIA! üôèüèª,btohqsg
cannot use amex card for simplygo,btohqsg
If you have nothing better to contribute  suggest you dun reply. My CBS credit rating is AA. Risk of default is close to 0%.,btohqsg
Exactly. Had applied for other cards at ard the same time. All gave in excess of 3 to 6 months limit.,btohqsg
Can share more on this if you can? I‚Äôm ok to cancel some of my cards if necessary. How would CIMB know how much limit other banks grant me?,btohqsg
Well  your limits are written in the CBS report. They can see how much limit you have with each bank and how much of it you are utilizing,btohqsg
Hi guys  for uob evol  if you use the physical card  does it count towards the 0.3% others category?,btohqsg
Question is why you choose physical card over mobile contactless? Give up 8% and choose 0.3%? Perhaps there is a way for you to use mobile contactless?,btohqsg
Isnt it capped at 20 for mobile?,btohqsg
Yes. So overall average out is 6.67%.,btohqsg
Hi  would like to check if anyone has successfully deleted EZ-link wallet and refunded with the amount in the wallet to your bank account? I had been emailing the CSO to ask about the refund status but no reply from them for the past 1-2 months,btohqsg
Hi i usually go JB 1 or 2 times a month. If I want to use data  what is the cheapest method?Also should I open a bank account in JB to save on cash exchange rate?,btohqsg
Some SG telco got free roaming to Malaysia if you are on that data plan.,btohqsg
for eligible spending yes (eg paywave at ntuc). but not recommended unless you have maxed out the cap for contactless and online and have no other alternative cards to use,btohqsg
NTUC FairPrice also can use mobile contactless  correct? Usually I only use Evol via Apple Pay (iWatch or mobile phone contactless) regardless I max out or not. Easy to pay. Just keep the physical card at home.,btohqsg
Any recommendation which CC to use for overseas car rental ? Preferable master so I can pair with Amaze.,btohqsg
If you have spend $300 on contactless and $300 on online  any more than that wont count to the cashback ma. In that case you can consider to tap the card physically for the 0.3% cashback category.Will I do it? No  i will just forgo the 0.3% and use mobile contactless like you haha. But ppl want to know whether can or not and the answer is yes and they can decide for themselves what is the best strategy.,btohqsg
Hello everyone  want to gather your opinion on travelling cards  do you use krisflyer or the  destination 's local card. E.g going to new zealand has its own star alliance.,btohqsg
Krisflyer is the loyalty rewards programme. Credit card is depending on where you can apply for (mostly Singapore)  need to be clearer on the question on what you want,btohqsg
One good website to explore where to credit your miles based on your fare  airlines and class ishttps://www.wheretocredit.com/,btohqsg
My aim is to access their airport  lounge,btohqsg
But won't it worth it to use the local destination's member cards for miles as your spending on car rental also counted towards points accumulation,btohqsg
"Why spend on the 0.3% category after fulfilling the 600? Shouldn't it be after spending 250 on mobile contactless and online  can just spend 100 on ""normal contact less"" then t he overall cashback will be higher than 6.67%?",btohqsg
Hey folks  I understand DBS WWMC and HSBC Revolution both awards bonus points for online transactions. Can I check whether Simba (TPG)  Senoko Energy and M1 recurring transactions qualify as online transactions for bonus points for both the above two cards? Thanks!,btohqsg
hsbc revolution dun reward bonus points for any of these  MCCs not in whitelist.Recurring is not online and utilities (Senoko) is excluded MCC so no bonus points for dbs wwmc either.,btohqsg
Agree. But what if the person already spend > $300 on each? And he/she dont like holding multiple credit cards?Thats why i say‚Ä¶I‚Äôm only answering to the original question yes or no with abit prerequisite for the scenario to make some sense. Not that I‚Äôm in full support to use it that way.We dk the person‚Äôs full story to keep making judgement on how they shd spend on the credit card. No need to keep piling on questions on why they want to spend it that way.,btohqsg
Any idea why refund the deducted back? Dbs dont have livechat for personal banking so cant contact them.,btohqsg
i would say its more likely agoda did the refund?,btohqsg
Yes cancel a hotel and got 100% refund but then deducted again.,btohqsg
I think you mistaken me with another user MouseHunter. I have no objection why the original poster wants to spend this way. In fact  I am pro the way he wants to spend like this. This is a clever way to increase the cashback percentage to be above 6.67%. I am just saying  in your example  you mention can spend on 0.3% category after the 600 spending. I am just merely saying  (in the interest of maximize the cashback %)  can just spend250 on mobile contactless 250 on online 100 on 'normal contactless' spend,btohqsg
Is my understanding below correct if I spend $300 on online and $300 on mobile contactless on Evol card to qualify for $40.30 Cashback.1).$250 online => $20 Cashback2). $250 mobile contactless => $20 Cashback.3). $50 online + $50 mobile contactless => $100x0.3% = $0.30 Cashback.,btohqsg
No. In this case you only get $40 cashback.,btohqsg
"Online and mobile contactless spend will be capped at $20 each. The additional $50 online and $50 contactless won't earn the 0.3% cashback  since they are ""capped"".",btohqsg
0.3% is considered as other spending so there will still be cashback,btohqsg
Is there any daily limit for amaze instarem cashback? Need to pay for hospital bill via health hub üòÅ,btohqsg
0.3% is 'for' other spending that is outside mobile contactless and online. Please check the UOB EVOL TnC.And I can tell you I only received $40 cashback so far  coz I only spent on online and mobile contactless.,btohqsg
Hi  for those having UOB one account and using 3 GIRO debit transactions instead SAL credit. Does IRAS ITX & PTX GIRO monthly payment counted as 2 or 1 transactions as it is from same organization? Thks,btohqsg
In regards to mobile contactless  does google pay considered as I read in singsaver notes that to enjoy 8% cashback on all online and mobile contactless spend (Apple Pay  Samsung Pay  Fitbit Pay)... Google pay not being mentioned,btohqsg
Per transaction up to 125  minimum 10. They only issue max 500 insta point per transaction.,btohqsg
Yes  need many 125 transactions üòÇ,btohqsg
What u can do is redeem the insta while u paying in block to maximize the cashback,btohqsg
What about CRMC? Or need to pair with Amaze for these merchants to make it work? By itself it won't earn 10x points? Thanks,btohqsg
Why you want to read other web site instead of UOB web site itself?,btohqsg
Amaze+CRMC should be ok for recurrent telco but utilities excluded,btohqsg
Hi  I'm a fresh grad  currently thinking of applying for credit cards  saw that UOB One account has pretty good PA interest rate. But was wondering  in terms of School Loan repayment  which card would you guys recommend? Am fine with any rebates (incl. miles) so long as its good rate. Thank you!,btohqsg
Thanks  your advices have been helpful. For utilities  my plan is to use UOB ONE for Singapore Power  provided the card eventually arrives üòîAs for electricity which I use Geneco  I think I'll use HSBC Advance. Not sure if there's a better alternative with miles card. I'm shifting from Cashback strategy to miles strategy.,btohqsg
Just happened to read it while checking out the promo in singsaver. Thanks,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt use citi smrt for 5% instead?,btohqsg
I have a few months till i'm new to citi again. No UOB evol as well ... so this already gives me the highest cashback ,btohqsg
I usually try to hit either contactless or online $250  with minimum $600 in total  recently only get rebate of $39.93  I never use card  not sure how is the calculation of 39.93  but also don‚Äôt check with Uob as the missing only 7 cents  but any idea why?,btohqsg
