Itâ€™s a menâ€™s thingy to look at the headlights,btohqsg

Tail lights can tell what car also,btohqsg

Nothing is holding back the well-to-do to splurge on material things. ðŸ˜‚ i thank them to help contribute to gov coffins.,btohqsg
for me more important is residential areas lahâ€¦ I donâ€™t even go mall so often these days. But just me lah..,btohqsg
Electric car's road tax more Chor right?,btohqsg
Lol. I think to many is they want the public transport to be near at their door steps. And that all the public transport must be EVâ€™d first.,btohqsg
back to my earlier question  2nd hand A-B parf car  between 3 years old car (i.e. 2019 - lowest COE mostly) and 7 years old (i.e. 2015 another year of high COE)  which one makes better sense?,btohqsg
please dont get these. you will regret. i hjave been in one many years ago. it is not safe. cramp inside and claustrophobic. and tiring to drive long. you will be stressed,btohqsg
u will feel like a dwarf even beside a miniðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
If you looking for a toy car,btohqsg
That's the perfect car to get,btohqsg
Actually not claustrophobic contrary to popular belief,btohqsg
i have. and immeditely i can size it up,btohqsg
Definitely not meant for comfort or long drives  just a fun little car,btohqsg
It feels like in a gokart? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Yes  have driven them as well,btohqsg
there is no safety. in a collison you will get sandwiched,btohqsg
You're definitely low to the ground but you have enough power to go around the expressways and cruise in the middle lane  can make overtakes as well,btohqsg
in japan  they have small cars because they dont drive long distance and many to nearby only. besides  they have a tendency to change cars every 2 or 3 years,btohqsg
Depending on situations. But yes i concur with you,btohqsg
One doesn't buy kei cars for safety  more for the character and fun,btohqsg
And there's many other cars on the road with very poor safety standards  just about what one is comfortable with,btohqsg
if you drive this in small roads alleys type and not on highways yeah ok. but in singapore you will drive this on ECP PIE,btohqsg
Even normal cars doesnâ€™t want to be in a situation of in between large trucks,btohqsg
dont have to be between trucks. in a typical collisons  you will lose,btohqsg
Can drive no problem  just need to make an effort to keep distance and stay out of blindspots. Similar to miatas,btohqsg
So many choose to slow down when approaching beside these big vehicles. Kind of having phobic moments. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
