T bills 3.13%! Looks like more money need better outlet!,btohqsg
is DBS Altitude Visa Signature Card good?,btohqsg
Is it a good idea to put $150k in UOB stash acc + participate in the Building a Nations Campaign?1) 3%p.a on first 100k3%/365*30*100 000= $246.57 monthly2) + campaign end of 5 months = $1 100 cash,btohqsg
Good. U got the formula correct this time. Welcome back.However  (1). you can consider put the $50 000 into other bank account to earn higher interest n compare it to UOB Stash.(2). Your monthly interest will vary depends on number of the days on that month.,btohqsg
So if I linked Google pay  should I link amaze card or the city rewards card ya??,btohqsg
Yes if debit confirm will show up inside your payment method slip. If not show means not ready/setupyet,btohqsg
Ur amaze card. Dont link citi rewards with google pay as citi explicitly excluded that from earning bonus pts,btohqsg
For example even sc e-saver 3.35% still higher then uob slash right?,btohqsg
Oh my bad. Didnt read properly. Uob stash should stop at 100k. Not worth putting extra 50k more.,btohqsg
Need to factor in the $1100 n lock in 5 months.If OP can include UOB One into his assessment and if he can fulfil UOB criteria for 5 months  then can make final decision.,btohqsg
So there is only the way using amaze card to get extra point like grab  online shopping (Lazada etc)? Others just direct use amaze card?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt hit the 500 spend so UOB one is out unfortunately‚Ä¶ but thanks for input üôèüèº,btohqsg
In this case‚Ä¶ is it better to participate campaign by putting in 100k with UOB stash  receive $700 at end of 5 months  and put 50k elsewhere? Maybe T bills,btohqsg
Definitely. Tbills or HSBC ega if you can.,btohqsg
hi guys  im looking to sign up citi rewards card. i gotta ask ü§° but i think that signing up directly on citi is more worth compared to the welcome gift in singsaver/moneysmart?directly on citi is 40000 ty points equivalent to 16k milessingsaver hasdyson supersonic hair dryer  ipad 9th gen  dyson vacuum cleaner  350 sgd shopee voucher. seems like the max i can get is 350 sgd,btohqsg
350 sgd is better than 16k miles imo,btohqsg
just use citi rewards directly for online transactions  amaze+citi rewards for offline,btohqsg

yeah  you're right (singsaver saysWhen you use your miles for an economy class ticket  you could get around 1.1 to 1.3 cents per mile  but the value could soar to over 2 cents per mile for business class bookings.). im completely new into miles. will do some research first. thanks anthony!also  even getting someone to refer me to split the referral bonus of S$150/2=75. still doesnt beat 350 haha,btohqsg
You can tabulate those options into excel  then you can have clearer overview of your available options n total return for 5 months.Do include UOB stash + Tbill  as well as UOB stash + OCBC360 into your option. Also the liquidity of your fund.,btohqsg
Hi can you guys advise if stamp duty fees is about 100k for a home purchase  which credit card would you pair up with card up to receive the best miles or cashback?,btohqsg
can use cardup for stamp duty?,btohqsg
Hello all  is there a way to know when one cancels a card?,btohqsg
What credit card to use best for Grab and Public transport?,btohqsg
SCB Smart credit card is good for public transportation. Higher earn rate on that card!,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôve realised can max rewards out of Citirewards for only up to 1k spend with amaze.Considering another card for the spend on top of this plan to spend less than 700 on top of this but also foresee some big payments soon coming up in setting up a rented home etc‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Any recommendations for a no minimum spend card ?,btohqsg
Is ur spend online/offline? Big payment is what kind and how much?,btohqsg
Consistent spend would be offline. Big payments for perhaps household appliances and bed etc.,btohqsg
Rental home would be unfurnished. So budget spends but foresee essentials being pricey.By the way also like to know if paying for items on Carousell through the app itself considered eligible or is it considered a ‚Äònets‚Äô transaction?,btohqsg
Offline tends to be under UOB preferred plat visa for apple pay/google pay.,btohqsg
If wan to qualify for oct interest  is it suppose to transfer out the money and left 2k on 31 Aug?,btohqsg
Hi  is 2.4mpd + amaze worth it for foreign currency spend or just use youtrip?,btohqsg
which card gives 2.4 mpd with amaze?,btohqsg
Amaze converts spend to local sgd to won't get fcy rate  only local rate.,btohqsg
Anybody have got their funds earmark for Uob nation saver promo?  mine not earmark and bonus not credited yet,btohqsg
Amaze converts your payments to SGD  so you wont earn foreign currency rates (e.g. UOB PRVI Miles + Amaze gives 1.4mpd and not 2.4mpd),btohqsg
If I spend on UOB one card today  will it be posted tomorrow as it‚Äôs a sat? Or what kind of merchant will be posted today or tomorrow if I spend today.,btohqsg
I also still hesitated to clear fund for sep for uob one. maybe later promotion actually not attractive ... hmm,btohqsg
Can foreign coins be changed at money changer or only notes? And is there a limit?,btohqsg
Hi all  would like to seek advice  on which card to use for my upcoming travel trip - for hotel booking (via Agoda  booking) and overseas shopping and dining.I have 3 cc namely  (1) CRMC+amaze  (2) Trust cc  and (3) UOB one. Also has Wise Card as well. Note: (a) No plans on signing up for new card  and (b) okay with miles / cashback benefits as def better than paying using my debit card (which I have been using for my past trips).For advice pls. Thank you!,btohqsg
Fyi I have 2 spending on last Friday posted on next Monday  but 1 spending in sat posted directly on same day  really doesn't quite tell whether it will be same day  sat or next Monday.,btohqsg
HSBC TravelOne card gives 2.4mpd on fcy,btohqsg
I don't think there's a need to pair it with amaze,btohqsg
Please read the original context from original poster. Thanks,btohqsg
7-11 and cold storage are some that do same day posting.,btohqsg
July  and funded in same month.Have another account I register in July but fund in Aug (believe that wont be eligible for Aug period),btohqsg
Then you might need to double check if you did meet the conditions already.,btohqsg
That time got a few also didn‚Äôt get earmarked when others got earmarked. Not sure if they eventually got earmarked or it was due to some conditions not met.,btohqsg
Got it  thanks! By chance usually for such promo it will be earmark on the same day (morning) or random. Cause I believe banks would have batch run to credit and earmark,btohqsg
