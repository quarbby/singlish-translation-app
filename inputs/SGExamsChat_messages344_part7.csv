hello guys  shd I drop pure physics if I find a lot of difficulty in it? did my prelim paper 2 today  every topic I didn‚Äôt understand( dc circuits emi) all came out  mind kinda blanked out and I‚Äôm honestly predicting like 10+ marksthose I studied( static  density eg) all didnt come out,btohqsg
feel so bad tbh  i understand the content and all but when it comes to application i can‚Äôt do it,btohqsg
dont drop  still have time to improve  but u might need a private tutor to explain to u concepts since the situation seen quite bad,btohqsg
i joined a group tuition w one of my classmate recentlyshe felt that the paper was ez while I felt rlly shit:(,btohqsg
tutor and sch tcr gonna be disappointed af,btohqsg
literally as I sat there during my exam I was alr thinking of dropping this subj :‚Äô),btohqsg
for prelims i also dk what was going on  got a C6  but then had private tutor to reteach almost the whole syllabus again  end up got A2 for o's.....it can be done,btohqsg
I can never get C6 :‚Äô)always getting D7-F9 what should I do?,btohqsg
I was triple science student and I dropped physics after prelims. If you don‚Äôt need it for A levels just drop it ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I take pure chem and pure phys onlyI also take pure geog and elect histTbh if I rlly drop a subj  I don‚Äôt know if I shd drop physics or geog( my hist isn‚Äôt that gd so I guess having 2 humans will still be safer),btohqsg
rilly depends on u want go jc or poly,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre doing worse in physics then that is the subject you should drop‚Ä¶ was doing 9 subjects then so dropping one was ok for me,btohqsg
Hiash I think my prelims gonna be all D7-F9s,btohqsg
Your physics grade will show on your results slip too‚Ä¶ but if you really cannot study the subject no point doing it‚Ä¶ I came to that conclusion after my prelims,btohqsg
Is having two sciences compulsory for jc? What if I only have one left( chem)?,btohqsg
try not to drop anything  just persevere and try to do ur best for olevels,btohqsg
i alr dropped hcl start of this yr hahah,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre aiming for science stream‚Ä¶ then I guess it matters later on‚Ä¶ you need to look at your points‚Ä¶ but it was a relief when I dropped it‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt feel pressured to do it.. everyone is different,btohqsg
i think the sch will advice u to drop to combined science instead of just having one pure,btohqsg
But means cock block sci stream if drop right,btohqsg
Wait what requirements for bio ah,btohqsg
there‚Äôs some hybrid combi too right?,btohqsg
which jcs have tho? anyway to find out?,btohqsg
if I get like 20%+ for my phy prelim I shd just drop right?,btohqsg
like i wanted to drop phy and a math  but now i look back  i realised it was a good thing i didnt,btohqsg
Idk ah cuz my sch officially ban dropping esp now but,btohqsg
same now no longer able to drop,btohqsg
