Bigger cc is better off the bat,btohqsg
Not just the bhp n torque figure,btohqsg

The renewed Coe S60 oso not bad,btohqsg
If anyone coming tonight see you later,btohqsg
The 1st gen is t4 ar?😂,btohqsg
I m lose with the t2...t4...t5...t6...t8,btohqsg
T2 reminds me of motorcycle 2 stroke,btohqsg
Wah..thanks sir..did not know t8 is hybrid,btohqsg
T6 shld be more than suffice😂,btohqsg
I think direct remap shld be more reliable than piggyback modules,btohqsg
Heard that new mercs n beemers oso similar situation,btohqsg
Lolx..good to know that and thanks for sharing the information sir 😁,btohqsg
Super got the low slung outline🥰,btohqsg
Been a big fan of the s90 since it was launched,btohqsg
The V series oso very nice😂😂😂,btohqsg
Becoz it is associated with some type of veh,btohqsg
That dun goes down well with auspicious,btohqsg
yes.. sometime i saw merz wagon.. i will auto think for that,btohqsg
Yeah..that the reason why wagons dun really sell well locally,btohqsg
If singapore don’t have coe. We also can haha,btohqsg
Hahaha.... Lacking of really professionals to do installation and settings😂😂😂,btohqsg
Air suspension have 5 to 6k scary price,btohqsg
ive been looking for the 5 series wagon for like damnlong nobody wanted to sell,btohqsg
Wrong .if dun have annual inspection n LTA then can,btohqsg
then when i gt my f10 immediately got two pop out for sale 🥲,btohqsg
Air suspension can put. Just when inspection put at nom mode,btohqsg
bc sometimes i fetch my drunk friends home,btohqsg
if wagon can just open behind and push inside,btohqsg
More than that for reputable brands,btohqsg
meOw anyone knows whr gt nice food at this timing,btohqsg
Same feeling as open top convertible,btohqsg
Think long n wide when comes to modding locally😂,btohqsg
Or else just standby for bi annually inspection plus a whole lot of contribution to the govt sector😁,btohqsg
I forgot need wide body HHa,btohqsg
Me abit OCD when comes to cars,btohqsg
That coupled with a penchant for having a old car is quite bad for the wallet,btohqsg
So I learnt to live with imperfections luh😂,btohqsg
As long not overly unsightly to me😂,btohqsg
Life mah .have to live with compromises at times🤭🤭🤭,btohqsg
Like my boss told me. Why mod. Just buy good sport looking car can alr,btohqsg
I was like u earn more lei,btohqsg
Sports car sio..got a reliable car happy like siao liao😂,btohqsg
Still sports car...dare not even dream abt it😂😂😂,btohqsg
Sports car how sporty?? Can play basketball or soccer?,btohqsg

Quite a few on the market,btohqsg
I know ex 1.5 auto got hks I think,btohqsg

Coilover should be the same as 1.5,btohqsg
Availability n lead time more important,btohqsg
If don't have also nvm 2.0 got bit more power than my current de can alr,btohqsg
Lolx..sir..is alot more power....in the manual form,btohqsg
Seen one highly modded 2.0T manual keeping up with the bigger bro evo10 wor,btohqsg
I don't expect the power to be better than evo x,btohqsg
But need some modding I think,btohqsg
I got open pod intake with exhaust and coilover should be OK alr,btohqsg
Then put on my evo 8 spoiler,btohqsg
Splitters side skirts and evo x bumper,btohqsg
