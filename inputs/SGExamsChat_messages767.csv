Organising change of command parades in the saf and the attendance can flip flop up till like 5 mins before the event starts,btohqsg
First say coming  then say not coming  then suddenly say coming,btohqsg
Speaking of which i once carried a whole hamper to chem lect and luckily there was w spare chair,btohqsg
Coz i lazy go to class first,btohqsg
Why u need 2 dry runs for?,btohqsg
Bro for EXCOs no one puts 2 dry runs in the proposal unless they are dumb lol,btohqsg
I was 2021 batch so when I saw Subcom it was Covid measures,btohqsg
Even better our Dry Run go on Zoom,btohqsg
Covid measures and covid exco sucks,btohqsg
It was literally a fucking zoom meeting,btohqsg
I was mostly go home club but only did my faculty's ambassador duties which were ez shit,btohqsg
Graduated from poly with a GwH,btohqsg
And then the actual one we had to do basically with no idea of the actual orientation in regards to location so YOLO,btohqsg
Also that but kena saikang lol,btohqsg
Ambassador is legit just tour guide with a fancy name,btohqsg
Is actually not that hard if u know how to grind,btohqsg
Know of a few that had like 8 CCA exco roles,btohqsg
As long as u ain't P or VP can liao,btohqsg
I don't have cca  only the ambass duties,btohqsg
Never really understood why anyone would go for like 5 different ccas,btohqsg
Is the fella built different ?,btohqsg
Also no one wants it lmao,btohqsg
I go home club can get gold with honours  what's the big point of going to 5 ccas😂,btohqsg
Some CCAs legit not enough viable applicants to fill the vacancy,btohqsg
I applied for VP I got Secretary,btohqsg
Just don't get Logs P or VP,btohqsg
Don't get why we're even paying them,btohqsg
No la is not small just that legit all are incompetent except for a few lor,btohqsg
RP Student Council had like idk 4-6 VPs,btohqsg
I was laughing my ass off,btohqsg
SPSU  why are we paying you for? Knn that time want to claim the exam study pack they ran out of stock,btohqsg
They every year got AGM to show us how they spend the money,btohqsg
Nani lmao the SC like other CCAs just got money by submitting proposals,btohqsg
And the school only funded those.,btohqsg
And if approved u got funding for what u specified,btohqsg
Per month I go kill them alr,btohqsg
Knn the chevron membership for what one sia,btohqsg
Oh I still remember every semester got one class bonding,btohqsg
At least yours got fee transparency la,btohqsg
Then just get money from there,btohqsg
I don't think that's an option,btohqsg
I think the rest do that too lmao,btohqsg
Is just tution fee + misc fee,btohqsg
Oh good lor. We need to pay for that,btohqsg
If not u get the unofficial one can cannot do shit with,btohqsg
ITQ need AOR  then AOF  then prepare SOR then need PAA to AOP  then can buy,btohqsg
The calculation is the same for all,btohqsg
Just your credits for each mod,btohqsg
RP got a few sems u do +1 or 2 more MC,btohqsg
Idk how many I raised in NS liao,btohqsg
Well it is what it is,btohqsg
Also that's assuming u follow the structure,btohqsg
If u fucked up and fail and retake,btohqsg
Means higher weightage for that sem,btohqsg
RPs Attendance policy ngl is retarded but still has so many loopholes,btohqsg
Its bloody hilarious.. so 13 lessons per module you have to attend more than half so 7 lessons the rest if u take LOA which is MC can technically skip and u will be fine,btohqsg
This is still qualifies as meeting attendance requirements,btohqsg
this is the most fucking cursed UI i have ever seen,btohqsg
why are all the font sizes so fucked up,btohqsg
how is this bot evading the bans tf,btohqsg
Bro i thought that food panda was smt else💀,btohqsg
So many loa tho in one week u full stack,btohqsg
"You only fail attendance for each module for getting 6th loa or 3rd absentSo yes you met attendancePlay your card right out of 13 lessons you can ""skip"" 7",btohqsg
Lol  MC is a free pass,btohqsg
fuck bus 3 fuck bus 109 fuck bus 89,btohqsg
i legit wanted to push someone out,btohqsg
Wait are u the guy called grit,btohqsg
Reminding me of nus shuttle buses💀💀,btohqsg
Meanwhile i think i accidentally off my phone charge before i slept or sth  then i did not realise my phone is not charged💀💀,btohqsg
Eh wait why are u waiting for buses at 9am  i tot tdy is normal timing,btohqsg
What is ‘loa’ in poly terms,btohqsg
Like u take leave fr work similar like that?,btohqsg
no this was earlier at 7.30,btohqsg
My lecturer js killed a cockroach,btohqsg
Bruh no 6 is the limit,btohqsg
6 u get the warning and LEO screams at you liao,btohqsg
Yes if you have 6 loa  if it's absent (no mc  reason). That is for the third time. You can stack 4 Loa and still have no issues.,btohqsg
1 red 2 yellow2 red 1 yellow3 red1 orange 2 yellow2 orange 1 yellow3 orange1 red 1 orange 1 yellow3 yellowAll will lead to failure,btohqsg
I stacked 6 and had no issues but your class mentor would be on your ass,btohqsg
Once u hit the Orange Triangle that's the maximum,btohqsg
Yep like the first mod from my friend  that's the max,btohqsg
Why tf they take the L for Late,btohqsg
If Late just bribe the faci to get present,btohqsg
Lmao no point  does not change anything,btohqsg
For me at least Late means grade cap for A,btohqsg
They say they won't downgrade during computation meh,btohqsg
No if u late I think they still will show your grade as what u earned,btohqsg
Rp system change alr  they also removed the grade cap,btohqsg
Lmao wut? Then wdf does Late do,btohqsg
Also why get late and partial,btohqsg
Just absent it and LOA cover waste time going to RP for that,btohqsg
Nothing  that's why it does not matter much and he continues being late,btohqsg
Prob cause he was alr otw to school,btohqsg
That's my point either get present or absent.,btohqsg
If u gotta be in school do it right,btohqsg
Partial means he so dumb that he came more than 30 mins after class,btohqsg
Got make up for LOA one,btohqsg
Might be harder but honestly just take that,btohqsg
Also if plan properly u LOA on non clustered test days,btohqsg
Who would want to do a makeup quiz if they can help it,btohqsg
I don't think they were planned,btohqsg
That's my gawd damn point. There has to be a plan for things like these,btohqsg
This ain't Picasso this is just shit,btohqsg
Lmao idk he still getting the bag,btohqsg
There's no reason to do any of the following,btohqsg
Oh yea he also gonna grad soon  so he does not care lol,btohqsg
Y3 is dun care but u gotta do it properly,btohqsg
No yours is just dumb how tf u got an F,btohqsg
🤣 I don't think he had any contingency plan to skip  he just skips whenever he wants  he did say his late and partial hindered him from being in director roll of honours,btohqsg
Even when I absent the make up I still can pull a D,btohqsg
As I fucking said fucking amateurs gotta skip with a plan,btohqsg
Presentation day is where most grades are and my grp likes to exclude me from presentation so,btohqsg
Aight  his life up to him,btohqsg
The real smart ppl be in business enjoying their vacation rn,btohqsg
Presentation is just one part and if u show contribution u will still scrap by,btohqsg
No like my team straight up dont send me slides,btohqsg
Always label your questions u do,btohqsg
I report so many times but lecturer doesnt do anything,btohqsg
it's ok i dun plan to say anything more,btohqsg
Y'all do realize i have a medical condition that prevents me from attending class,btohqsg
i literally have a chronic illness,btohqsg
Y'all same camp as my classmates ah js because not in sch then it means cannot contribute?,btohqsg
I dealth with these people a ton  they don't send me slides  then I'll just make one super random one for them to do. Just find relevant info and pics and tell them present that slideSeeing them struggle to understand and explain tells faci everything they need to know about the contributions of this teammate,btohqsg
I have a chronic allergy to bullshit,btohqsg
now js need to figure out how to get em to actually add it,btohqsg
Rmb had a slide about nuclear energy  this girl was like going to think she could free load from the team even had another teammate to help cover her free loading  I created a slide that seemed relevant and she struggled to connect a water desalination plant to nuclear energy.I wonder why 🤔?,btohqsg
I mean i skip a bunch of my lessons I can still contribute  so skipping lessons doesn't mean cannot contribute,btohqsg
Ya but for my grp it basically means that,btohqsg
so if they exhibit this behaviour towards u,btohqsg
must have a reason for it,btohqsg
and like when i tell them ill do it by submission and they literally say no,btohqsg
Cause like idw do it within lesson hrs,btohqsg
i told them its basically impossible to do it within lesson hrs for me and there's literally no downsides if i submit by 2359,btohqsg
but yeah they say cannot and must be by 11am or some sht,btohqsg
Then like they end up doing it because they refuse to wait,btohqsg
They basically want everything way before deadline,btohqsg
when im literally on a backlog,btohqsg
Bro is digging his grave rn,btohqsg
the lecturers are aware so my deadlines for grp work and individual project is extended by half a day,btohqsg
You know what's interesting  sounds like your team just wants to get the project done and over with,btohqsg
Its not even project bro its worksheet,btohqsg
and presentation for 3 weeks later,btohqsg
The worksheet is the group project,btohqsg
idk man im just here to distract myself from class,btohqsg
Also you never seperate the work meh?,btohqsg
I got a CC5 presentation in 5 mins,btohqsg
Got lah but they dw wait for me to do and submit by 2359,btohqsg
Done and.over with without quality I might add,btohqsg
so they js go ahead finish,btohqsg
I just numbing myself from the pain,btohqsg
eh i got cc5 on friday,btohqsg
then one later in the afternoon,btohqsg
i put it lidad so i got 2 day no class,btohqsg
when u are in a common programme,btohqsg
Dude they can js sleep what,btohqsg
Same but I pack to keep Thursday and Friday,btohqsg
team worksheet is OTOT by 2359,btohqsg
My inference tell me they think you will sabo them,btohqsg
What have you demonstrated to allow em to trust you to submit on time?,btohqsg
Hello bro they do their part can go off alr js dont touch the one with my name what,btohqsg
They can literally submit their ver first,btohqsg
i know i had to redo ppl's work before,btohqsg
but like its kinda dumb tho they can submit their one first then later i submit another,btohqsg
Exactly always check the final draft,btohqsg
So a team that wants to get work done and over with and don't want to deal with the hassle of problems arising after their submission  it's likely your team ain't going to touch that docu until 3 weeks later before presentation,btohqsg
Because your name is on it,btohqsg
Oh btw Team worksheet grades are only affected by the question u answer,btohqsg
then end up i peer eval them down,btohqsg
If they put their name they basically shield themselves alr,btohqsg
Our team gonna peer eval 1 guy down,btohqsg
Yes even sometimes faci mention it in remarks,btohqsg
That's why for this sem my col is not counted when im on loa,btohqsg
I wonder howI wonder whyYesterday you told me 'bout the blue  blue skyAnd all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree,btohqsg
Nah the song is stuck in my head now,btohqsg
Same lmao it fits this situation as well,btohqsg
Ryan would u do work when u sick af by same day even when u have loa,btohqsg
Bruh its like the playground idea of stop hitting yourself,btohqsg
Dude then wtf am i supposed to do ah,btohqsg
I alr fucking said so. Strategic LOA,btohqsg
bro i am sick like i have a chronic illness,btohqsg
there's an actual reason behind my loa,btohqsg
its not abt strategy or some bs bro,btohqsg
why are you studying if you on LOA,btohqsg
or is it short term LOA,btohqsg
I am sick too bitch this is the real world,btohqsg
Cause my grp want me to do the sht by lesson time,btohqsg
i mean regardless  deadline is deadline ah,btohqsg
No  if your teammates are pushing you to do it. You can either accept it or go against them and just relate back to the fact the faci have extended your end of the submission,btohqsg
U are on your own and have to do it,btohqsg
I go against but apparently deadline extension is a myth for them,btohqsg
either u talk to your teammates and ask for extension  or u suck it up,btohqsg
Cause it's only for you  they can't trust you,btohqsg
I alr got extension from lecturer,btohqsg
u can't always use your lecturer as a meat shield,btohqsg
And it's might be because you were absent irregardless of reason.Being absent from a team sends a bad message irregardless of whatever reason you may have,btohqsg
Dude im not explaining my personal health problems to everyone i come across,btohqsg
i alr told them i need the extension because im actually sick but they refuse,btohqsg
so i js do it on my own,btohqsg
nobody is asking you to  and idt everyone wants to hear it too,btohqsg
Yeah they basically dont give a fk abt the reason,btohqsg
I don't think they expect the reason of you skipping  I think they expect a reason of why you did not check in to at least let them know you will be absent,btohqsg
this is the kind of shit that'll get u fired,btohqsg
I always inform them when absent,btohqsg
"they say ""ok we will let u know what to do""",btohqsg
then proceed to give some deadline of 1hr when alr got extension approval,btohqsg
"then they reply after lesson saying ""nvm we do already""",btohqsg
Honestly this sem is gonna be better so,btohqsg
Ok so when you finish your presentation in 3 weeks time  send all these evidence to your faci,btohqsg
prev sem was js common programme ppl,btohqsg
ngl even if i was faci i wldnt do much,btohqsg
i did that for some mods so overall i passed,btohqsg
At least that's your alibi and now it's up to the faci if they want to reason or accept any alternative grading,btohqsg
daily grade affected but not taken into consideration,btohqsg
am i supposed to give someone a better grades just because they have a chronic illness and they can't do their part,btohqsg
I got submit but under individual,btohqsg
so my daily grade basically remains the same like reflected on the system,btohqsg
Why don't u just LOA for the entire sem?,btohqsg
Yep but failing a student inccurs Alot of paperwork for rp  so they honestly try their best to not fail students,btohqsg
but when overall computing comes there's some allowance,btohqsg
i mean that's not a RP specific thing ah,btohqsg
i dunnid to complain to my prof to get a pass even if i nvr do anything,btohqsg
I complain my team wont let me do so i did the work alone and as prove i submitted individually,btohqsg
In rp you will fail if you dont submit work,btohqsg
i mean that's the job scope of a student ah,btohqsg
Or i explain why i never do with my team,btohqsg
So not doing anything means a fail in rp as well  but majority of fails for rp are cause of absent w/o work,btohqsg
so if your prof alr ok w it then why still need to complain about your team since it's essentially an individual work alr,btohqsg
They usually say for the daily grade they can't reflect what i did but for overall they can,btohqsg
Cause they alr told the team to include me ah,btohqsg
as if that's gna do anything,btohqsg
cause sometimes when im present they still exclude me,btohqsg
They straight up dont send stuff to me even when asked,btohqsg
True but the lecturer need prove that they tried before actually allowing me to do alone,btohqsg
So your teammates is basically acting like they did not hear the faci request of including you,btohqsg
ok so try alr  so now can do alone right,btohqsg
So that's why i say it'll be better this sem,btohqsg
ok then you're just complaining about people being people la,btohqsg
good luck once u grad then,btohqsg
its also cause like i have this classmate,btohqsg
but he gets a sht tom of concession from them,btohqsg
js because he is struggling with self diagnosed aspergers,btohqsg
like he can don't do anything and they'll help him do,btohqsg
then put his name on it,btohqsg
ok so you complaining about the world being unfair?,btohqsg
Then they come act like some big sht,btohqsg
the world is full of hypocrites unfortuntaely,btohqsg
I cld care less if i do well,btohqsg
Good luck in the working world honestly  serious 💭,btohqsg
I'm in intern now and alr have my fair share  Alot of my colleagues are complaining,btohqsg
I'm not senile 90% of the time please,btohqsg
ngl i actually dont care abt them being hypocrites until they actually start complaining to lecturer i got an unfair grade for being absent,btohqsg
Why? You think I'm closed off from the real working world ah,btohqsg
Same shit posting rn but in class,btohqsg
Hear me out  shit post on reddit,btohqsg
Nah I like how bedok always pulls this as if like the real working world does not have people like me,btohqsg
Wait my teammate name is pronounced as ramadan,btohqsg
Time to change plan and get a new phone with it,btohqsg
Delphine moment but tbh im immuned to her liao,btohqsg
I never regretted my subject combi,btohqsg
Dw I'm alr learning Alot on why the govt is slow af on doing things  jrl got extended to 2029 and I know the exact reason why,btohqsg
"""please ah this is week 5 already""",btohqsg
H2 alr got u more than that lol,btohqsg
Layers of clowning across diff companies are responsible,btohqsg
will u get fired if u say why,btohqsg
Bro might be leaking confidential info if he does,btohqsg
Nah bro the govt service is known for being lazy lol,btohqsg
You can ask the ns ppl here  they know,btohqsg
Don't u mean there will be lazy ppl,btohqsg
no  i'll find the best way to do the job in the shortest amount of time so i can slack,btohqsg
Cannot hit result just extend lorh,btohqsg
"im not quite sure ""laziness"" can summarise the delay of a multi-million dollar project",btohqsg
"let's chalk it up to ""laziness""",btohqsg
Either that or overworked+lack of manpower,btohqsg
Civil Engineering is always a fucking pain,btohqsg
overworked and lack of manpower has been the summary of the singapore construction industry since  forever,btohqsg
Even with planning it is unpredictable one,btohqsg
Not to mention the earth itself is unpredictable,btohqsg
and I will say that I talked to the JRL upper management + some LTA ppl before,btohqsg
The prefabricated parts and building is quite easy is just when u lay the foundation what happens if u found granite in that mound,btohqsg
There's always not enough manpower in manual labor jobs/industries,btohqsg
Oh yea it's not these people that are lazy  LTA is very efficient it's the contractors,btohqsg
meh the JRL contractor i talked to were scary efficient too,btohqsg
responding to some student feedback in 2 weeks,btohqsg
Our company reached out to All the contractors we need for the jrl line  only 25% replied back to us,btohqsg
The others literally mia on our company,btohqsg
why do u expect them to reply u,btohqsg
They might js not be interested,btohqsg
Yeah at this point ima js end up working for HPB lol,btohqsg
My classmate told me he knew a rp intern that went for a 1 yr internship at PUB and said she literally went there to drink kopi for the whole year at pub prob a job with data involved,btohqsg
maybe cause poly intern can't do much,btohqsg
All gov sectors looking for degree+,btohqsg
Poly U assigned to Technician level,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdooreh remember the intern RP story I told u?,btohqsg
My supervisor is a poly graduate and he has significantly more to do and is assigned to more things as expected but the job scope is very simillar,btohqsg
I mean as well I'm paid $30+ a day..I don't want to be doing the same task people that get paid $100+ a day do,btohqsg
I mean from what I can see I'm assigned to just jrl  my supervisor is assigned to jrl  dtl cl and tel...so his salary as expected is prob 3x more than mine since he is assigned 3x more projects,btohqsg
3x more than me is like $3k a month,btohqsg
that's damn low for a sup,btohqsg
I think in the hierarchy here  a sup is not very high,btohqsg
What is this LTA job about?,btohqsg
Because I probably have done something like these when I was a student in NUS,btohqsg
I'm not working at LTA lol,btohqsg
But infering train+lta+contractors likely you can decipher the company I work for,btohqsg
I'm not going to publicly say it here,btohqsg
Actually I don't know because I have been working in Japan for 5 years,btohqsg
They broke you out of discord,btohqsg
Welcome to the asylum of Telegram,btohqsg
Tm now got film society ah,btohqsg
Anyways I alr failed a quiz so I won't be hired back lol,btohqsg
I guess its good for the time being,btohqsg
As long as I don't see neko luna here too frequently can liao,btohqsg
It's safe until Bedok gets back admin privileges,btohqsg
hi roy im doing differentiation by first principles rn,btohqsg

Like desensitisation out of ur worry / fear …there are 2 parts of ur brain so essentially u can never act logical when u are emotional,btohqsg
I pretty much didnt like that topic…same problem as acai  like nth goes in,btohqsg
I forgot what to do when a terrorist attack happen alr  isit stop drop and roll?,btohqsg

BREAKING: DPM Lawrence Wong will take over from PM Lee Hsien Loong on May 15.https://str.sg/dCuZ,btohqsg
Very likely going to have a GE before the end of this year,btohqsg
Doubt they will wait till 2025,btohqsg
Actually you will know a GE is coming when suddenly got more chicken wings,btohqsg
Nah I think it’s going to happen in second half of this year,btohqsg
Oh well that means I need to travel to the Singapore embassy and cast my votes again,btohqsg
pls happen second half of the year,btohqsg
We’ll see. I think most analysts think it’ll happen this year,btohqsg
Former MP Inderjit Singh also thinks so in the interview with him,btohqsg
I can’t even vote yet but that means whole day free at least,btohqsg
Maybe this upcoming election is like a very close tie,btohqsg
Nah. I think they will still get their 2/3 majority even if the opposition makes some more gains,btohqsg
If I recall during the previous election  its like 61% vs 39%,btohqsg
You living in what country now?,btohqsg
I kind of want to work there but idk if it’s a bad idea,btohqsg
Only time will tell. They probably all planned it out by now  but once the electoral boundaries review committee releases their report it’s very likely a GE would happen within 1-4 months,btohqsg
It seems that they are losing like 8% of the votes from 2016 to 2020,btohqsg
If the trend continues it will become a close tie,btohqsg
I don’t think the swing would be that huge tbh. Only slightly. Perhaps something a little worse than the 2011 performance  so I’d think high 50s percent,btohqsg
maybe they will gain two grc,btohqsg
Their popular vote share probably wont swing so much,btohqsg
And also it rly depends on the quality of candidates fielded in each constituency and the party contesting,btohqsg
Doesn't matter lmao the popular vote doesn't correlate to GRCs,btohqsg
Once the map come out then we know,btohqsg
Maybe they break up West Coast and East Coast,btohqsg
Sekali West Coast grc is gone,btohqsg
East Coast with Nicole Seah gone I feel like the incumbents wont lose yet (for now),btohqsg
They won't touch the Opposition ward tho,btohqsg
But I’m curious if Potong Pasir SMC will be gone,btohqsg
Ah yes the lowest population seat,btohqsg
By rite they should break up AMK,btohqsg
They will try to get Aljunied,btohqsg
Also Chiam’s set of 27 years,btohqsg
They give up for Hougang liao,btohqsg
lol with the current slate of candidates it’s very unlikely they would win. Not a single minister there,btohqsg
In 2015 they should’ve gone all in and sent a heavyweight team but too bad  the boat has sailed,btohqsg
U think that would have made a difference? Lmao,btohqsg
What if AMK candidate switch with Aljunied?,btohqsg
AMK is carried by him lol that's why it's the most unequal grc,btohqsg
In 2015 WP team got like 51% of the votes. Ofc it would. The pap team didn’t even have any heavyweights then. If let’s say george Yeo contested with PM lee in Aljunied no way they’d lose,btohqsg
Too bad George Yeo decided to retire from politics also,btohqsg
That's because they newly redistrict that,btohqsg
In 2015 there wasn’t any boundary changes to Aljunied I thought,btohqsg
I need to look it up again,btohqsg
Actually what's the sentiments in Singapore these days?,btohqsg
There's the Fengshan SMC cut off tho,btohqsg
Charles Chong actually said in an interview he suggested sending a heavyweight team to Aljunied grc in 2015  but in the end when they didn’t he said he was frustrated the leadership didn’t take up his suggestion,btohqsg
Yeah but I was talking about Aljunied,btohqsg
I am not in Singapore so I really have no idea what the sentiments these days are,btohqsg
They could’ve won it in 2015 but didn’t send a better team,btohqsg
All I know is things in Singapore are getting way way expensive now,btohqsg
Charles Chong is a former pap mp,btohqsg
It was reported in the press,btohqsg
Which rn is redistricted to include Sengkang,btohqsg
Ya but the heavyweight team need not to have included himself,btohqsg
He said he suggested to party leadership to send a better team there,btohqsg
Suggest is one thing send who is another,btohqsg
Ya la. So that’s why I said they did not take up his suggestion in the end which was why they lost Aljunied again,btohqsg
He legit in Punggol cuz they fucked up,btohqsg
the lee dynasty is coming to an end,btohqsg
Some of the ministers could’ve left their safe GRCs to go Aljunied,btohqsg
Anyway it’s too late for them now,btohqsg
If they want to get back Aljunied  it’s definitely not happening during the next GE,btohqsg
I just imagined Lee Bee Wah in Aljunied,btohqsg
Well she’s one of the more well known ones so would’ve worked better than the team they sent in 2015 anyway. They were full of unknowns. And it didn’t help that Kahar Hassan was pulled out from Kaki Bukit right before the GE for unknown reasons,btohqsg
they got cooked into chicken rice. 47-9,btohqsg
their defense is legit non existent,btohqsg
i sub with the girls score 50 points liao,btohqsg
Isit AC basketball not very good or smth,btohqsg
Not to shade like genuine wn,btohqsg
is nan chiau high sch a brand name sch?,btohqsg
Yes although the students take o levels instead of ip system,btohqsg
wonder how he survive so long,btohqsg
actually right  what is 1 term of PM?,btohqsg
There is no such thing here rly  based on the Westminster system we inherited from the British. They just need the confidence of the majority of parliamentarians. Technically LHL can rule for life as long as he has enough MPs to support him,btohqsg
since independence there was only 3 pm,btohqsg
Why h2 physics got formulary sheet  h1 dun have,btohqsg
said all the anti pap people,btohqsg
Lhl took over goh as 3rd pm in 2004 Goh won the 1991 1997 and 2001 elections which allowed him to stay till 2004,btohqsg
There is no such thing as this,btohqsg
She’s asking about the role of PM not how long one parliamentary term is,btohqsg
h1 also have  just that much shorter cause only show the formulas relevant to h1,btohqsg
i am asking how long one parliamentry term is,btohqsg
How come I dun remember having one,btohqsg
Maybe it is early onset dementia,btohqsg
PM is prime minister not parliament..Anyway one parliamentary term is up to 5 years and the prime minister has the discretion to dissolve parliament earlier and call a snap general election,btohqsg
If it happens this year  means PM Wong would’ve decided to call one earlier instead of waiting until the end of 5 years,btohqsg
Role of pm? Bruh that can be googled  the parliamentary term can't. You need to do maths because goh was brought in to become a pm as a emergency,btohqsg
it’s ok u pharm student  give yourself medicine,btohqsg
the boys are good  they won a div last year,btohqsg
She said PM by accident instead of parliamentary term which was why I was confused. Cos there’s no such thing here as a fixed PM term,btohqsg
BUT NO OFFENSE THE GIRLS CANNOT PLAY BASKETBALL  they're damn horrible,btohqsg
2 days ago they got DEEP FRIED AND POUNDED INTO TERIYAKI CHICKEN  92-6,btohqsg
A parliamentary term can last up to 5 years  starting from the date of the first sitting following the General Election. Once Parliament dissolves  a General Election must be held within the next 3 months.From sg parl website,btohqsg
huh i said pm  i tot got term like president,btohqsg
So I don’t get what you’re asking now. If you’re talking about Pm  there is no such thing as a fixed term,btohqsg
They just need the confidence of a majority of parliament members to continue,btohqsg
cannot defend paint  cannot hustle for ball  cannot rebound  cannot even run,btohqsg
For president  6 year terms.For parliament  up to 5 yearsFor the role of PM  none. Just like in the United Kingdom (from Wikipedia: No directly set terms; however  they must maintain the support of theHouse of Commons which has a term of five years),btohqsg
me and my friend will cook them bruh,btohqsg
spending too much time with the boys cos they can actually win a championship,btohqsg
Also because the Pm simply just needs the confidence of a majority of members  midway through a parliamentary term they can keep changing PMs. (Cough UK cough),btohqsg
they're actually horrible and I'm not even good at ball,btohqsg
i see them play at the sch basketball court,btohqsg
u should make a sticker pack,btohqsg
till i pass the test first,btohqsg
lol I had this feeling that in ac the boys teams are generally better than girls teams,btohqsg
Like whenever got the sports results announced I see the boys teams for most CCAs getting a higher position,btohqsg
acjc girls squash team also quite mediocre,btohqsg
it's like telling a bodybuilder to arm wrestle with a scrawny girl,btohqsg
curious  wld yall guys try to do more competitions n stuff or focus on WAs  at sec 4,btohqsg
Normally people that focus more on competitions fall into two cats. The ones that know they can't improve much anymore or the ones that are not booksmart.The first thing Poly Jc and even Ite look at is your results not your participations in competitions,btohqsg
see your capacity. if you've got a handle on your regular acads stuff then sure. if not your ability to focus on both simultaneously must be there lol,btohqsg
i mean pretty much all of the competition cover o lvl syllabus so i see why not that kind,btohqsg
i want that experience to compare outside of my sch environment,btohqsg
but it's not limited to o level?,btohqsg
Sorry man I was spring cleaning the house,btohqsg
tell that to the YPs man,btohqsg
So seems like there won't be a huge change,btohqsg
Cca only really used in tiebreakers,btohqsg
The good news is I can abandon my jackets and all,btohqsg
ideally i get at least above participation for the 2 junior olympiads,btohqsg
And finally the weather is getting warmer since it is like 10 degrees last week,btohqsg
The other ite telegram group that calista told the owner whom created off for creating one,btohqsg
The bad news? Well summer is coming,btohqsg
Like what did the Santa guy say,btohqsg
like those Harvard dudes with a 3.5,btohqsg
Aka I am not looking forward to go to the office,btohqsg
How long have you been living in Japan?,btohqsg
Because apparently my office aircon not cold enough,btohqsg
im not completely throwing my others,btohqsg
Actually I'm turning my fan on now so...,btohqsg
was just sorta arguing w a classmate why the usual toppers did worser in WA1,btohqsg
Nah the plan is to go to Harbin during early August,btohqsg
This year's Sakura season is pretty short-lived though,btohqsg
He just casually mentioned he goes jc in the ite channel of the grp,btohqsg
It was too cold this March,btohqsg
wish sum1 cld fly me thr fr,btohqsg
The temperature in Japan rise and fall pretty fast,btohqsg
One week it is super cold,btohqsg
One week later it is like 20 degrees,btohqsg
Then next week becomes 10 degrees again,btohqsg
Do you find it hard to adapt to the culture and lifestyle there,btohqsg
I’ve been binging lots of Japan videos,btohqsg
I think that's why I'm getting migraines,btohqsg
Lifestyle some of it can be very frustrating,btohqsg
Do you feel like some locals can be xenophobic,btohqsg
Or most of them are very nice,btohqsg
My friend had to buy a singlet,btohqsg
Cuz she didn't pack enough warm weather clothes,btohqsg
Actually quite a lot of the locals are more of the polite nice,btohqsg
So they seem nice because they sound polite,btohqsg
Xenophobic? I only encountered like a super small handful of them,btohqsg
Usually they are those old jiji,btohqsg
Ah ok that’s good to hear,btohqsg
And usually you will realise its the grandpa that probably voiced out their xenophobia,btohqsg
The grandma usually don't really voice it out,btohqsg
Japan is one place I've always seen on ads,btohqsg
And slowly every year I'm getting more drawn to it,btohqsg
Well there are too many tourists in Japan now,btohqsg
Ic lol I rmbr during my first trip to Japan in 2012 I ate at some omu rice restaurant with some grandma as a cook and she was damn nice. I went there a few times during my stay around the area and on my last visit she gave me some gifts. I think most of the ppl in Japan seem very friendly but I hear they’re quite frustrated about the over tourism in some areas,btohqsg
The behaviour of some PRC tourists are reprehensible,btohqsg
The grandma usually is the nicer ones,btohqsg
The grandpa is usually the grumpy ones,btohqsg
I once went into a yakitori shop and then wanted to eat yakitori,btohqsg
Also when you first started working there  were you able to speak Japanese or you were forced to learn it from scratch? I feel like language is the biggest barrier for me should I work there,btohqsg
Something I never understood is how so many Chinese tourist from mainland china can become entitled,btohqsg
To the point they have that reputation,btohqsg
The owner was like please order a drink but the only beverage they have is alcohol,btohqsg
Some literally stand in the middle of the road to take pics and block traffic,btohqsg
You go any big major city in china   you can see their lives are not great  it's all a facade,btohqsg
So it becomes a bit xenophobic because the grandpa owner is asking if I'm from mainland Chinese,btohqsg
So not wanting a commotion  I left the shop,btohqsg
With the wife actually apologizing for his husband's behavior,btohqsg
You realise that the Japanese you learn in Singapore is not really enough for what's ahead,btohqsg
You know  knowing history  we have every right to be mad at them 😂,btohqsg
Ok she must have actually felt bad,btohqsg
But yea I do pick it up and all,btohqsg
Now I can somehow survive in the office context,btohqsg
But you ask me to talk to Japanese clients that one I cannot whoops,btohqsg
Hmm how did you learn Japanese while in here,btohqsg
Did you attend like tuition classes,btohqsg
My first company actually give Japanese lessons,btohqsg
I know there’s some in singapore for korean  but haven’t heard of any for Japanese,btohqsg
But the Japanese lessons is meant to prepare you for the office context,btohqsg
Of course I learn on my own,btohqsg
Plus living in Japan actually helps me to expose with everyday life,btohqsg
So I picked up Japanese from there,btohqsg
