Of cos not as powerful or desirable as a bmw  but i think its good for what it is worth. Also not a cvt,btohqsg
By the way both are 3 cyl engines  even though the bmw unit shld be a little more refined  but i think it should be negligible,btohqsg
Oh sorry only 1.6 4 cyl available for the c5 now. Which is a good deal considering depre is still below 14k,btohqsg
i do like french cars but their reliability idk also haha,btohqsg
like some say good some say bad,btohqsg
if not i do like the DS7 crossback,btohqsg
Actually i dont really know why their reputation is so bad. Along with british cars. But the newer models camt be that bad?,btohqsg
I owned an alfa recently and didnt really think it was unreliable at all contrary to popular belief.,btohqsg
Popular belief is wrong. Because it’s based on hearsay.,btohqsg
Sleeper is good sir. I love those cars where people see or hear it and they go “wait a minute … is that a … “ vs those that try too hard with piercing raspy exhaust only. Personally Low rev E9x m3  merc V8s just make my day. Admittedly they attract fellow males mostly wahahaha so really depends on what one is looking for in his / her ride.  The (lifter+induction?) sound of the E9x S65 is just so unique and amazing at Low revs from the outside. I remember hearing it in real life in Germany when it was recently launched back then and I asked myself “wait what car was that!?”,btohqsg
What’s there not to love about the sound of a free breath  free rev NA V8?,btohqsg
Which is the mistake many buyers make sometimes. Best to do proper research,btohqsg
@fatty_peachI’d also like to recommend checking out the Korean suv or EVs too.they’re good value for what they can deliver whether performance  looks or functionality.,btohqsg
all conti are basically not much problem first 100k. their real real reliability test is after 100k,btohqsg
My take is cars are like relationships. It’s all about how you take care of them. If you don’t consider their needs and neglect them  they will likely give you trouble after the honeymoon period.,btohqsg
good morning! it doesn't represent actual wealth in any way contrary to popular belief.,btohqsg
Contrary to popular belief that salary is not increasing ppl can still buy new cars,btohqsg
Property included. So u stay in condo u millionaire le,btohqsg

Good morning everybody . Just join the community,btohqsg
Agreed  the induction noise is unreal. But from the outside only hahaha. In stock form  inside is not that fantastic below 3k rpm.,btohqsg
8.2k red line yo! Julian should have bought one to replace the fd2r lol,btohqsg
I mean generally most cars start to have minor issues after 100k. I think conti cars have more issues maybe due to the complexities  or over engineered? 1001 sensors here and there haha,btohqsg
It was new so i serviced at dealer,btohqsg
Window down or roof delete! 😁😁 or Eventuri time ☺️☺️,btohqsg
Haha yes in due course. Not due roof delete. The intake hahaha,btohqsg
Actually the e93 is the cheapest among all,btohqsg
what’s there not to love about a great sounding vert,btohqsg
Wah memories of US101 and Europe drives.,btohqsg
e93 m3 vert or the f83 are the best,btohqsg
if got bigger budget the SL500s and above and the conti GTs are the so niceeee,btohqsg
newer Alfa should be more reliable . their old ones plagued by their selespeed system,btohqsg
Makes sense too now that i think of it,btohqsg
If got even more budget will be a 458 speciale aperta hehe,btohqsg
Yup it is. they use a zf transmission now. And gone with the old electircal issues  but build quality is still lacking,btohqsg
ah yes but that one not as comfortable as a true gt car hehe,btohqsg
Does the Super variant (198hp) and Veloce variant (280hp) use the same engine?,btohqsg
some say Alfa Romeo use Ferrari engine😛😛,btohqsg
The masses who said likely haven't owned before,btohqsg
i got a feeling too haha,btohqsg
i really love the giulia though,btohqsg
