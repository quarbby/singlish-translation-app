you should be able to use the manual application form where you can provide your latest payslip manually (although they still need your latest NOA too),btohqsg
Your current application might still be for year before. Were you working in 2022?,btohqsg
Should be fine. They just need to see that entry of salary credit.,btohqsg
Was looking into getting the citi rewards paired with instarem  thats why i applied 😅 didn’t know they’re strict with online application aspect.,btohqsg
If you included NOA and CPF statements and still got rejected then have to wait alr,btohqsg
Hi  I plan to buy T bills BS24109A using OA fund .  I never try competitive bid before .What % shd I place for competitive bid ?,btohqsg
How long u all take to receive instarem amaze card after applying? I applied on 30 apr  app say will deliver by 13 may. About 2 weeks is the usual timeline?,btohqsg
For me  about a week ish. For my new card and my replacement card.,btohqsg
i see. But keep your options open as there are similar cards out there offering u similar benefits if not better👍🏻,btohqsg
Any other options ure suggesting? Like UOB miles card?,btohqsg
If we're going overseas  which would you recommend: Wise  Youtrip or Amaze? For withdrawal and normal spending,btohqsg
Trust card for withdrawal. Spending with amaze,btohqsg
Does amaze has any transaction fees?,btohqsg
What is the benefit for evol credit card used in sp group,btohqsg
no benefit other than clock to uob one account card spend for bonus interest,btohqsg
For UOB One I managed to hit the $500 spend on the very last day of April but it seems the spend is tracked as this May onwards. So I did not receive the bonus interest. Any point to call up UOB to give me chance?,btohqsg
U can try as it happened to me before but they rejected,btohqsg
Amaze card has higher spread than trust card (i.e. bit more expensive) but allow us to earn credit card rewards. The rewards are usually worth it.,btohqsg
I think u can try but u have to make up the spending as well.,btohqsg
Any advice on which cards to use when going china? I know need to use Alipay n save in CC,btohqsg
I just called UOB and they will appeal  but the condition is this month got to spend like $600 according to the officer to make up for it or something,btohqsg
For UOB one  they tracked by posting date. If your posting date is in May which I guess when you said you did spending on the last day  then unlikely they will help you.,btohqsg
Good to hear that. But do your spending a few days before end of the month so you won’t miss the boat,btohqsg
I had a friend who was in the same situation. His appeal was not successful,btohqsg
All these still up to the banks discretion.,btohqsg
Maybe first time and new cardholder that's why they waive,btohqsg
