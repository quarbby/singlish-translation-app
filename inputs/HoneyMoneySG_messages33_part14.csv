Good habit.I have a routine to check through all my credit transactions end of the month before paying,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not Kelvin.I use an app to track all my daily transactions and tally my credit transactions end of the month. Pay my bills before the due date.If you want hassle-free then maybe can try giro like what others have recommended  reduce spending or keep to only a few credit cards.,btohqsg
What all you using for that ?,btohqsg
HomeBudget  it‚Äôs a paid app.There are a lot of other apps you can try and see what works for you.Alternatively  you can also create your tracker via Google sheet.,btohqsg

For uob one cc  is DFI additional cashback on top of the 2k I have alr spent or within?,btohqsg
For UOB One card  do supplementary card spending combine with the main card spending for the cashback?,btohqsg
if the $2k include DFI  the DFI count to quarterly rebate+ 6.67% bonus rebate. Still get 6.67% bonus rebate if DFI spend on top of $2k. Total bonus rebate capped at $100 per month.,btohqsg
Meaning I shouldnt spend more than 2k on uob one?,btohqsg

Hihi Will i still get my miles if i pay a merchant through paypal via credit card?,btohqsg

Guys just to check to link amaze + Citi rewardsIn singapore spending contextWhat‚Äôs the catch ?,btohqsg
Cos I check with amaze   there no points for local spend,btohqsg
makes your transaction considered as online  which is eligible for 10x points (4mpd),btohqsg
I have Ocbc titanium or citi rewards card. Would these work?,btohqsg
Catch is  amaze converts ur spending to online spend  which will qualify for 10x points  provided MCCs are eligible...,btohqsg
Just tried to waive Amex TCB annual fee and only got offered 50% off.. probably due to low usage. Should I just pay off my balance (excluding annual fee) and cancel it?,btohqsg

Hello gurus! If I use favepay  shopback app to pay using WWMC  does it qualify as online spend?,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know if hsbc revo bonus point is by calendar month or statement month? Thanks,btohqsg
Shopback yes. All DBS/POSB cards exclude FavePay from earning rewards.,btohqsg
What does it mean by provided MCCs are eligible? Like for CRMC i thought online spend  will get 10x pts. Let‚Äôs say i go to restaurant and pay via Amaze card linked to my CRMC  will i get 10x pts since it‚Äôs now considered online spend? How abt Starhub bill or insurance? Will i get 10x if i use Amaze? Thanks,btohqsg
Any singsaver HSBC cc promo now ?,btohqsg
Do I get 10X rewards if pay with  HSBC Revolution CC at the hotel counter? Or it must be online or contactless (Apple Pay) only?,btohqsg
Contactless can be physical card paywave also,btohqsg
Just be careful when you paywave that the receptionist doesn't insert the chip in the machine,btohqsg
online is a separate indicator from MCC. Any transaction via Amaze+CRMC is online but MCC need to be not excluded also. E.g. Insurance mcc is excluded  so no 10x point even if it is considered online.,btohqsg
Anyway to use citi amaze for hawker QR code aka hawker stall? That‚Äôs the main bulk of my payment,btohqsg
XNAP + Google Pay  but heard some people say that XNAP MCC is an excluded MCC,btohqsg
No idea  some one need to try,btohqsg
I think Google pay for android only. I‚Äôm using iPhone and apply pay does not recognise amaze card currently. If use citi reward as Apple Pay will not give u 10x because it is not considered online without amaze?,btohqsg
Ah you never specified that you're using iPhone. No  CRMC alone won't earn 4 mpd,btohqsg
Aiya  then citi amaze will look useless to me now.,btohqsg
Hi Experts  may I know if I pay via favepay using my my credit card  is it entitled to credit card points?,btohqsg
LoL incorporated in Belize good luck of they fold or run away with your money,btohqsg
