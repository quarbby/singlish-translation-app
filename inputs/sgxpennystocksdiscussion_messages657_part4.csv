üéâPika World Bit Size Update ‚Äì 1 June 2022üéâüß∏Bye May  Welcome Juneüå¥As the equity market ushered in a new month  June has been a good month. May was a relatively flat month despite the indices closing in red yesterday. The rise in oil prices is regaining inflation fear  given Europe‚Äôs decision on a partial ban on Russian oil. This drags down major indexes.Oil prices initially popped higher to hit $119 but moderated to a level around $115. Yet  the initial rise had already motivated stock selling  given that oil prices had risen by double digits in May. Elevated oil prices bode poorly for the stock market. High inflation is eroding the profit margin for the corporation  forcing them to raise prices  which is hurting demand. While the latest inflation result showed signs of peaking in inflation  higher oil prices will threaten such positive progress.aWith the earnings season almost over  Pika World believes geopolitics and oil prices will again drive the market sentiments  given their impact on the next quarter's earnings.üèãMeeting of the TitansüíéAs Uncle Powell spoke with Uncle Biden  both men were committed to bringing down inflation. It is the first meeting since Powell is nominated for his second term. It is a peaceful continuity as Biden stressed non-interference in the works of the Fed.The Fed is positioned to increase the rate by 0.5% in each meeting in June and July. It comes at a sensitive point when Biden‚Äôs popularity poll has fallen. His approval rate is at 40.8%  which is a drop from 43.4% at the start of the year.It is a tough nut to crack. The global economy is getting wobbly  persistent inflation due to the Ukraine war is likely to continue  and supply chains is still under strain with volatile energy and commodity markets. It is almost certain a hot soup for Biden.It is 1 June  Wednesday   9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a splendid day ahead!,btohqsg
