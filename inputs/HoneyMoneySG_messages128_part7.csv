Anyone bought PIMCO Income Fund (E Class Income) (SGD Hedged) ?,btohqsg
What do u think of this fund,btohqsg
this fund currently still can buy but the NAV alrd increasing  had started to price in rate cut. current dividend shld be around 6.1% (fixed 0.04547 per share)  you can buy it but to closely monitor if its dividend reduce together with the rate cut. if reduce then better sell faster.,btohqsg

Oh wow I just realized got new one,btohqsg
Just called Citibank to change my rewards card statement month to align to every 1st of the month  however the CS agent said it canâ€™t change statement date. Is that true?,btohqsg
Its well known for citi. Btw  CS already told u so  what else do you expect?,btohqsg
Im here to see is it true as I am not sure is it the CS agent not familiar with that process. As I have most of the others bank able to change the statement date for me.,btohqsg
Last time citi still offered to change to 10 or 15 thou. Is it no more already?,btohqsg
and if you do one  may I request if you are able to provide clarity on the applicable MCCs for each category?I am not able to find the MCC details when surfing through the website.This has the huge potential to replace the soon to die Amaze.,btohqsg
Anyone heard of this trust Cashback credit card? Seems like a mix of UOB one and UOB lady card featureâ€¦ðŸ¤”https://trustbank.sg/cashback-credit-card/,btohqsg
My statement is 1st of the month. But I didn't ask for it. Just happened to be,btohqsg
But since some of us are already having 1st of the month  I don't see why they can't do it for those who requests. Seems do-able,btohqsg

Trustâ€™s competitive FX rates make it ideal for overseas spending  though cashback caps and consistent spending requirements apply.My first impression is that the Trust Cashback Credit Card could be an excellent option for foreign currency spending in selected categories  thanks to Trust's competitive FX rates. However  the cashback benefits are limited by the quarterly cap and the need for consistent spending over consecutive months. Iâ€™ll be evaluating how this card fits into my future card strategy  especially for overseas purchases.- Trust Bank Code:HUQPC614https://www.trustbank.sgðŸ‘‰ Discuss morehttps://t.me/honeymoneysgðŸ‘‰ More referralhttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg

New  can apply on Trust app,btohqsg
Whats the difference between new and existing trust credit card,btohqsg
may i ask what are the benefits for having it as first of the month?how is this determined? e.g.  if i were to sign up for a credit card now  will the starting day only be when you first use the card?sorry  am a fresh grad  just curious as im looking to start applying,btohqsg
Hi all shifu  may I ask  for ocbc 365 rewards  is it tagged to monthly (01-30 Sep) spend?Or is it tagged to credit card monthly statement date?If itâ€™s tagged to monthly spend  probably I can start clocking now? As the posting date will be few days later?,btohqsg
Ocbc card is mostly counted by monthly posted transaction,btohqsg
Benefits is that if you pair it with amaze  then you can track both within calendar month. I have no idea how it is determined though,btohqsg
Hello  recently just converted to OCBC 360 with the 365 cardDidnâ€™t manage to change my salary credit to OCBC bank for this month hence I guess I wouldnâ€™t be able to clock the salary bonus category (read here that the FAST transfer from another different account wouldnâ€™t work anymore)Qn: On top of the 100k I placed in  do I still need to put in 500 to qualify for the save bonus category?Also for the spend  for online transaction  (holiday trips) do they count towards the minimum 500 spend?Subsequently moving forward  when salary comes in  will I still qualify for the save bonus category if i transfer away my salary leaving only 500 increment each month?,btohqsg
no worries  thanks hannah! pairing with amaze  u meant the citi rewards card?for cashback/miles  do both 'hold' the same monetary value? still cant decide if i'd want to go for cashback or miles.. hmmm,btohqsg
Yup  Citi Rewards MasterCard. I initially got it for the 4 miles per dollar. You can use it on almost everything except travel related. But I ended up using the points to exchange for supermarket vouchers because the miles game is really too long. Voucher is about 3% cashback,btohqsg
thanks hannah! i think mainly non-ASEAN countries is tougher to accumulate miles for? but yeah up to individual preferences..,btohqsg
I was hesitant about chasing miles  so just wanted to give it a try. The good thing is you have a variety of options if you decide not to redeem for flights. Just that I think the value of flights is much higher as compared to that of vouchers,btohqsg
Anybody knows why the snack distribution cost is so high ? 5%?,btohqsg
Distribution is another word for Dividend,btohqsg
But my current position is negative ? ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Capital Gain/Loss is separate from distribution/dividend,btohqsg
According to my wife she called  Citi told her is either 5 or 15 of the month. I trying to make it 1st of the month because wanted to align with amaze card 1K local SGD transaction quota.,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s why i trying to ask and get data points if there is request successfully able to change to 1 of the month.,btohqsg
From various dp  unless you are lucky to have 1st of the month as your statement date (usually by approval date of ur cc)  cannot change statement date outside of options given by Citi CSO.,btohqsg
I also want to align it with my amaze card but oh well :(,btohqsg
For the new trust cashback card  is there anywhere saying it can be used as debit card  for overseas cash withdrawal purpose? It's my main use case at the moment.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGitâ€™s 4.89%The 1% is on top of the 15% bonus$555 x 15% = $83.25$1445 x 1% = $14.45Total $97.70 per monthTotal $293.19 per quarter$293.19 / $6000 = 4.8865% card benefit.,btohqsg
I just applied and got approved. There's no option to pair trust cashback card with savings account,btohqsg
Still need to use trust link card for overseas withdrawal,btohqsg
Yeah thats why i separated base and bonus,btohqsg
Looks like it's pure credit card only.,btohqsg
Hi guys  when should I withdraw my funds from HSBC EGA and put into OCBC 360 to maximise the interest rate if 31st Aug and 1st Sept falls on a weekend?,btohqsg
