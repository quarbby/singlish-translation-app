Too many claims... eat into their margin so they making it more difficult to claim. Many will find it too troublesome to claim.,btohqsg
how are you getting so many $5 orders when the starting base is $10? my order revenue is already after commission  i get numbers like 10.52  not round numbers. information fee seems to be something else.,btohqsg
and i dont get information on all orders. in fact most orders dont have this fee.,btohqsg
cannot be the 16%... his info fee numbers are way too large. one of them ($9.38) is higher than the order revenue ($5). 16% of $5 is only 80c.,btohqsg
did u take a lot of cash orders?,btohqsg
could be the 16% deduction from the cash collected. but have to check against order history. cash collected not shown in balance details.,btohqsg

Hi. How is fare for round trip calculated?,btohqsg
Eg from Thomson to Tampines and Thomson again?,btohqsg
So it doesn‚Äôt calculated basis total mileage??,btohqsg
Means it‚Äôs just Point A to Point B. And then +4 or +8 depending on motorcycle or car??,btohqsg
Eg. Jurong West to Pasir Ris is approx 25 bucks by motorcycle. A round trip would be +4 total 29???!!!,btohqsg
No  because round trip is only meant for documents or small items (eg signed invoice)  you are to return it any time before day ends. Ie. Return at your convenienceIt is not meant to be a double trip,btohqsg
If that‚Äôs the case...then there‚Äôs something inherently skewed with the fare computation,btohqsg
But if my order is at 8pm. Anytime before the day ends is like 4hrs?,btohqsg
You need to understand the services better  all these should have been in the web training or your handouts,btohqsg
Shit. Should never take round trip jobs.,btohqsg
Short term memory. I forget stuff,btohqsg
Anyway thanks for replying me. Much appreciated,btohqsg
Update. I think they clicked round trip by mistake. Haha. Extra 4 bucks,btohqsg
