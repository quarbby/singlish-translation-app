usually pri sch teachers in general (my own experience) are bad,btohqsg
that being said  the ultimate bad teachers  actually (not all)  are beyond the reaches of MOE,btohqsg
Or can ask ur MP to write to MOE or something,btohqsg
MPs hold meet the people sessions weekly,btohqsg
The specific area hes in charge of,btohqsg

LOL he keep on flaming jo teo but never got pofma,btohqsg
Was quite surprised he could get even more votes than WP in 2015,btohqsg
Probably have a lot of verbal insults,btohqsg
I guess if wp sent a good team to Jalan Besar they‚Äôd prolly get more votes than lim tean,btohqsg
Then  can say goodbye to jo,btohqsg
Pv only got like 35% of the vote cos I think generally people don‚Äôt trust them,btohqsg
I also feel that quite a number of my friends trust parties like WP but as for parties PV they won‚Äôt vote for them,btohqsg
I also disagreed with the sia environmental tax but i guess it‚Äôs great WP won more seats,btohqsg
calvin cheng is the definition of a bootlicker üòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe I‚Äôm thinking their talking about using tax to internalise the cost of pollution but I guess not much point,btohqsg
Aren't they alr planning to do that,btohqsg
One of the failures produced by the nmp scheme IMO,btohqsg
At least the nmp scheme also got good people like anthea ong,btohqsg
not that easy to just like..... overnight change every single thing,btohqsg
the only thing worse than continually churning out shitty policies is praising shitty policies that he isnt even good enough to come up with ahaha,btohqsg
Yeah she and a group of other nmps tried to be useful and did stuff like suggesting amendments for pofma so I guess their efforts must be applauded,btohqsg
She also questioned jo Teo on the foreign worker,btohqsg
the tax  alongside some grants  are to encourage firms to r&d better tech to emit less,btohqsg
And by doing so exposed the true colours of j teo,btohqsg

Bro   if I sine inverse 1 for basic angle( sine a= 1) then what are my quadrant?,btohqsg
Help me for cosine and tan too,btohqsg
For sine cos and tangent there‚Äôs this thing called principal values  which is basically the values u get when u take inverse,btohqsg
So for sine the principal range is from -pi/2 to pi/2 so when u take sin inverse of 1 you‚Äôll get pi/2,btohqsg
The principal range for cos inverse is 0 to pi and for tan inverse it‚Äôs -pi/2 to pi/2,btohqsg
Hand break before i write finish,btohqsg
Who wants play üèÄ after exams?,btohqsg
I CAN STILL TAKE THE EXAM IF IM LATE,btohqsg

From what I understand it depends how late you are,btohqsg
Because some people may choose to leave the exam hall early,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think you can do that in national exams,btohqsg
