Why do people go fine dining if it’s thousands of dollars,btohqsg

Think when a person rent a car  they have no intention to head into accident thus the expense outlay is low. But when accident happen  the cost increased exponentially. In the end  it is all about the drivers.,btohqsg
Ya but sometimes that is not a choice,btohqsg
