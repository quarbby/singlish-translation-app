Hello  I have a mechanical question,btohqsg
My wheel got damaged by a rock. It is a definite replacement. On consult with Les Schwab (A tire company) Recommendation is that to replace all 4  wheels and tires.I am of the opinion that they are overselling me  but I could be wrong. I intent to just replace one wheel and tire for that matter  same specs as the rest.  Will it be an issue in the long run if I just replace one? (the damaged),btohqsg
if you get wheels and tyres that are the exact same spec with the other 3 I don't think you'd have a problem? but you gotta make sure specs are exact,btohqsg
Yeah  that‚Äôs my thinking too  but I‚Äôm not exactly very well-versed in this area  that‚Äôs why I posted here because you gentlemen definitely have more expertise than me.,btohqsg
reco to replace wheels and tires (i assume rim & tyre) is on the basis that if 1 crack the other 3 might soon.. and tyre is so that it runs smooth and not unbalanced,btohqsg
If you want to save money  replace rim and tire in a pair (front pair and rear pair),btohqsg
So say ur front left tire and wheel is busted  you replaced both front tires and wheels,btohqsg
Oh  it was an impact damage,btohqsg
Oh? Ok so 2 by 2,btohqsg
