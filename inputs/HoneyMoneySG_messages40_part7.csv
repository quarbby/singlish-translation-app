For the $250 CB without min spend  I follow the link but didn't see the 250$ mention explicitly for the SC Smart Visa. Can I clarify?,btohqsg

Hi  may I ask what is the best card to top up to grab wallet for miles?,btohqsg
Hi may i know paying insurance premium with credit card is considered fulfilling $500 spend for UOB one account,btohqsg
yup have been doing so all along  it works,btohqsg
Top up I not allow. 0 miles,btohqsg
I mean grab top up is not allow to earn miles,btohqsg
Like maybe branded goods in Europe,btohqsg
There are no miles cards that gives miles for GrabPay wallet topups. Only card that gives cashback is UOB Absolute at 0.3% cashback,btohqsg
To add on. Top up.Elink card  grabpay  shoppe pay.Miles card earn 0,btohqsg
HSBC customer service said that if the card account is not opened by this month  we won't qualify for the promotion. They also said it typically takes 7 to 14 working days but now high volume.,btohqsg
your average balance need to be at least 500 more then the previous month average balance,btohqsg
Uob kf with amaze  uob privi?,btohqsg
Anyone know about moomoo cash plus  recommend?,btohqsg
Hi for OCBC 365 card the calculation of spend is by calendar or statement month?,btohqsg
So as long as I maintain $500 from my monthly salary credit to OCBC 360  that‚Äôs considered saving  right?,btohqsg
I use it to park idle SGD and USD I have. My Cashplus uses two MMFs. One for USD and the other SGD. So far  green. Purpose is to get a little  bit of returns for idle cash.,btohqsg
U referring to the spending for Ocbc 360 or Ocbc 365? If I'm not wrong  360 is calendar and 365 is statement. Regardless  do note that the transactions need to be posted within the calendar or statement month to qualify. Date of transaction ‚â† Posting date.,btohqsg
Oh sorry I meant the credit card,btohqsg
Sorry for the wrong info.Exerpt from ocbc:To enjoy the above cashback  you need to spend a minimum of S$800 based on posted transactionsin a calendar month.If you spend less than S$800  a flat 0.3% cashback is awarded.Cashback amount is capped at S$80 per calendar month.,btohqsg
For me  I pair another MC to the Amaze card for overseas travel related spend (e.g. Uber  Car Rental). I use OCBC 90n Mastercard. Not sure is there a better one. Open to comments here? Haha,btohqsg
Hi AG  not sure how much idle cash you have at the moment  I think Chris made one video on being a priority banking customer  you may get better rates for their high savings accounts on offer  which beats parking in brokerages. Else you can try either UOB  OCBC or HSBC. Do look up on his informative videos üëçüèª,btohqsg
I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly. Cash advance fees is incurred when a person withdraw money using his or her credit card at atm and the fund source selected is the credit facility given by the bank. If he or she uses a credit card to withdraw money from the linked bank account  that is not called a cash advance.Sorry for digressing  the short answer to your question is no.,btohqsg
I not alot of money parked in moomoo. About 200 US$ bah. Sure I would take a look. Thanks for sharing.,btohqsg
There are some banks like HSBC that treat Revolut topups like cash withdrawals and charge cash advance fees,btohqsg
Ehh  this doesn't make sense to me. There is no money withdrawal involved. To me  it's a top-up using credit card. It is either supported or not supported.,btohqsg
I ask cus i remember some cards will take a wallet topup as a cash advance. Mmmm.,btohqsg
Thanks :) i would take note. Can't remember any.,btohqsg
Confirm there would be fees to keep the fund manager office lights on and pay salary. But we would not be able to see the fees reflected in the statement.Hence  to me is no fees. Hahaha.,btohqsg
I am thinking of swaping my hsbc advance cc to hsbc revolution. But how do i activate the 2.5% cashback rather than having points? And i do not see them listing the exclusion or t&c for cashback  only the 1px pointa,btohqsg
You need to use the points to exchange for the cash back. Don‚Äôt think the cash back can be applied directly,btohqsg
