Top up to expiring ezlink to cash out,btohqsg
That is what been done by other in the past to churn,btohqsg
i dont have any $ stuck in it so still fine for now.. just sad they suddenly stop allowing topup to revo / youtrip etc.,btohqsg
U dont get any extra point from using ezlink to revolut and youtrip right,btohqsg
I only top up to ezlink wallet when they run the cashback promotion,btohqsg
