I didnâ€™t see your resume earlier  are you like basically one of those hci 90 RPers,btohqsg
cos you can use HCL to replace EL.,btohqsg
Ok but must be still pretty Zai a level results I guess,btohqsg
so like if your EL was bad  you can get in based on HCL. But then you would need help with GP?,btohqsg
what if u get an A1 for Hcl,btohqsg
I think can use hcl as L1,btohqsg
then they also need go gp bridging,btohqsg
then I would assume you don't need to go for the GP bridging,btohqsg
gp bridging is ALL JAE need to go,btohqsg
iirc HCl students can minus extra pts,btohqsg
this is the part i'm confused by LOL,btohqsg
oh ok  sorry I must have missed that part then.,btohqsg
with the amount of mental gymnastics youre pulling,btohqsg
he needs to go for gp bridging,btohqsg
Even if they pass it's more than enough to minus by x amt of pts  iirc,btohqsg
With all due respect pls just stop  I think the more you talk about this the more youâ€™re making a fool of yourself,btohqsg
which she said in bold earlier,btohqsg
I hope I donâ€™t have to retake a levels  the brain rot is super bad,btohqsg
Forgot so much stuff from having not studied in close to 3 months,btohqsg
wah this whole convo confuses me,btohqsg
im going to go back to marking gp essays,btohqsg
go back to doing wtv you're doing,btohqsg
we can talk about smth else,btohqsg
marking gp essays is not any better,btohqsg
actl i should ask my teacher about gp bridging lol,btohqsg
i see the same level of logic,btohqsg
marking essays you can just call it out,btohqsg
Wah you still taking up students,btohqsg
this one a bit more tiring,btohqsg
Religion is not relevant today because there are less people who are religious,btohqsg
the ones you'd send are fking funny,btohqsg
"idk i also feel people dek what ""liberal"" ""left"" means",btohqsg
"everytime i see people use the word ""liberal"" i just feel like throwing them into a wall",btohqsg
"""For example  with the rise of Covid-19  it has proved that religion could not help improve the situation even if they pray for an improvement in the situation. Therefore religion is not relevant""",btohqsg
Yâ€™all have more faith in me than I myself,btohqsg
ngl i feel anyone who writes a religion essay,btohqsg
cuz singaporeans dont know any religions,btohqsg
Just smoking stuff to meet the word count,btohqsg
Same I feel ppl hv alot more faith in me than I do in myselfðŸ’€,btohqsg
Yours is too low level alr  at least I think I can be confident of getting at least one A,btohqsg
I think you going to be like 90 or near 90,btohqsg
how fuck all did u went sia,btohqsg
i was confident in like 0 As for A levels,btohqsg
i was very confident i would get an A for chem,btohqsg
cuz i knew the whole batch fucked up,btohqsg
I feel like Iâ€™ll get 80-85 but Iâ€™ll see  I take an arts stream combi so a most of the marking is very subjective,btohqsg
and even tho i fucked up,btohqsg
i know i didnt fuck up as bad as others,btohqsg
cuz arts is pure skill its either u have it or u dont,btohqsg
Wdym  as in ppl who estimate their scores?,btohqsg
