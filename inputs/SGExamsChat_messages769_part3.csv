Considering how your sister acts like an elitist can understand,btohqsg
It's just cause I went for an interview recently,btohqsg

I refuse to associate myself with ejc,btohqsg
Ej taught me that for anything I want I need to work twice as hard minimally to deserve it,btohqsg

Near 0% chance they‚Äôd put it on a Sunday. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve ever done it before  plus lky did say he did not want to be treated like a saint,btohqsg
Besides analysts a former pap mp also said he‚Äôs very sure that it‚Äôll held by the end of this year,btohqsg
But that would suck since no PH,btohqsg
