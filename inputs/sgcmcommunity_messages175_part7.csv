2025 election . Dun think they are stupid enough to throw away the votes,btohqsg
i think for current cars  just install 2 piece can liao  the touchscreen one can add on if getting a car after 2025,btohqsg
Ya that is why they install till 2025 then erp 2.0 start from 2026,btohqsg
Cannot too fast too furious Liao,btohqsg
I think at first they just charge same rate like our existing erp  but we all know laz eventually will keep increasing,btohqsg
By the time they start the charging   I will sell the car,btohqsg
How is it gonna be 250k,btohqsg
The touch screen will connect to the battery ? Will the car battery used up fast?,btohqsg
I just hoping if they gonna increase the erp in the future  can decrease the arf or smth. So in the 10 years still pay same price,btohqsg
But aiya  I think fat hope,btohqsg
I tot by right w ERP 2.0 suppose to remove coe.. but now seems like they gna keep both.. double taxed lo,btohqsg
Automotive   property  fuel & water  they can suck and suck,btohqsg
How they gonna do it sia  imagine I just get new car with Coe and shit. Then the following year the remove Coe and implement the new system. Like that how sia,btohqsg
Must see how much they charge lor   start engine then start charging Liao ?,btohqsg
Ltr 2cent per km.. one week 700km..,btohqsg
I think more likely $1 per km,btohqsg
Wa i will sell car le,btohqsg
cause if u take average 13k km per year clocked in SG and divide by 130k COE price  roughly same...but this is just a guess ah  don't find me if i guess wrong lol,btohqsg
Really not worth to drive anymore,btohqsg
maybe discounted rate for fleet/taxis thats all,btohqsg
Singapore government got no intention for people to buy car since the implementation of the coe .,btohqsg
If car was cheaper......maybe 3mil cars,btohqsg
What i feel is  COE shld be perm,btohqsg
then subsequent release of coe depends on how many dereg,btohqsg
Coe tag to ic for life. U sell car  ur coe gone. Then cooling period 2yrs before buy next car,btohqsg
Lol non drivers will also hoard coe,btohqsg
Gov allow people to over trade that why now so many people own cars,btohqsg
Just stick to the 30/70 or 40/60 .,btohqsg
U still pay 30/70 ot 40/60,btohqsg
Just tht the loan of the car increases to suit ur 30/70 or 40/60,btohqsg
If nt how u think 100% loan works,btohqsg
Submission to banks n finance coy is nvr 100%,btohqsg
Stil 30/70 or 40/60 at max tenure 7yrs,btohqsg
Just tht if u no money for 30% or 40%  then ur car gets inflated to 30 or 40% more lor,btohqsg
After all coe is forced by the buyer reach the high price,btohqsg
Coe low   every people is happy,btohqsg
U get ur car  i earn my money,btohqsg
My friend recently go to 1 PI to ask . The PI gave him 8.46 % interest,btohqsg
Banks nt stupid to not know a car gets inflated,btohqsg
A car selling 100k at all other dealers. But this dealer come to me for a same car selling 140k owner down 40k take 100k loan,btohqsg
As long as hit 40/60 or 30/70 on paper work,btohqsg
Unless gov set rule say HDBonce.buycannot sell lor,btohqsg
Want to sell can only sell at buying price,btohqsg
Gov can only introduce cooling measures,btohqsg
Tbf hdb their predecessors messed it up,btohqsg
Its an error which canâ€™t be fixed without hurting current owners,btohqsg
Where got public housing on free market one? It should be kept affordable. I mean our local market model is different but yah,btohqsg
The moment u go free market  affordability cannot be used,btohqsg
Now hdb also not affordable  if no grant given,btohqsg
Its suppose to be cheap for ur 1st house,btohqsg
