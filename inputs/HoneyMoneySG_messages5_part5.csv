Good morning.. I am new user on MOOMOO. May I know how long does it take for SGD to convert to USD after clicking on currency exchange?,btohqsg
pretty immediateor at most 5 to 10mins,btohqsg
yeah quite fast but only weekends then you need to wait till market open again on monday i think,btohqsg
actually i just take a quick look  they stated the estimated time of exchange in the app,btohqsg
I see. Ok thanks will check on Monday,btohqsg
Oh after I click confirm exchange  there wasn't any message,btohqsg
Oh ok thanks I didn't notice,btohqsg
hey! I'm a self employed person and I have question on how much cash should i top up to my CPF account to be able to pay for a HDB flat in the future. I saw in one of your videos that you use a substantial amount from the OA account to pay for it leaving $20k. thats quite a big sum. I will like to know how to get such a big sum over the years through how much money i put in every month.,btohqsg
Different things. How much you top up to cpf doesn't mean you have enough funds to secure your hdb mortgage payment.Cpf oa is just a form of payment. Topping up cpf for tax relief only has options for SA and MA  which do not matter fot housing payment,btohqsg
First determine what budget you have for housing  then work backwards to calculate how much oa needed  with your income level,btohqsg
I'm actually looking forward to endowus and syfe update video. But we all know the market hasn't been good  so don't think there would be much positive results.,btohqsg
After a week of owning cypto card  I notice some F&B merchant only accept cash  NETS or QR code.,btohqsg
I saw crypto has a crypto pay QR scan. Do anyone know whether it uses the money in our debit card or sell our crypto to pay?,btohqsg
Hi Chris A friend  aged 50 this year will work until at least 65 (could be more years)OA 100kSA 101kMA 63kAlready rstu 8k this year..So urgent strategy is to transfer 3k OA to MA  transfer 80k OA to SA  leave 20k in OA  is it necessary to leave min 20k in OA or as long as SA > 60k  will get extra 1% for full amount 60k? Is this correct quick strategy?,btohqsg
If OA not required for housing  education  investments etc  can consider pushing into SA till FRS (192k). Before 55 yrs old  extra 1% on 1st 60k combined CPF balances in this order (OA up to 20k --> SA--> MA),btohqsg
If OA is 0  1st 60K of SA will receive extra 1% interest,btohqsg
Syfe just done on 31 Jan. Endowus coming this week,btohqsg
Anyway you cannot transfer OA-MA  only OA-SA is possible,btohqsg
Last year the earnings were quite positive  very interesting to watch.But now everything red red. Very sad to watch it.,btohqsg

Then can withdraw out cuz its recognised as debit card topup,btohqsg

If he transfer 91k to SA  to reach 192k ie FRS  so he will not get hos tax relief for 8k a year rstu right?,btohqsg
Do other CC company give flash deals also?,btohqsg
plenty. Citibank does them tooDBS too,btohqsg
Intend to get SC or UOB,btohqsg
Sc flash deal coming tomorrow  details out tonight 9pm,btohqsg
Is there a way to find out when is the flash deal going to happen before it does?,btohqsg
He has to decide if the tax relief from RSTU of 8k a year is more important  or the compounding of SA (FRS)at 4% is more important. Tax relief can still be obtained by topping up MA if he wishes to  if MA is below BHS,btohqsg
Can instantly know that if Iâ€™m the 1-10th applicant? Because not very interested in airpod ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
Hi ChrisI intend to invest my srs using endowus. Which is better... Dimensional or LionGlobal?,btohqsg
Can't  can only hope. Anyway next slot 3pm coming,btohqsg
Dimensional for world equity or core equity funds. Lionglobal for s&p500,btohqsg
But Endowus is not the cheapest for SRS investing in S&p500,btohqsg
I have a portfolio with them under general investment.I saw one of ur video that you recommend dimensional?Watched it some time back... can't recall :),btohqsg
