nothing  just curious to know how its calculated,btohqsg
Based on how much you owe (billed).If the amount owed multiplied by their stated interest rate is lower than the minimum flat fee  then they charge the flat fee only.Else they will charge you both flat fee and interest.They will always charge a finance charge separately the moment they charge you a fee.Please always pay in full  on time.,btohqsg
never ever borrow from cc. else really deep shit.,btohqsg
cus ive seen several different ways of it being calculated. never always the same,btohqsg
I think bank staff ever told me it is xx%  ie. 27%  of total amount printed on the bill. Not the outstanding amount. Hopefully I remember wrongly. Perhaps divided by 12?,btohqsg
Try this formulaTotal bill printed amount x 27% x (51/365)Is it very close to your amount?It is either 50 days or 51 days.,btohqsg
Does anyone know the EIR for OCBC 360 for salary+save below 75k?,btohqsg
Did anyone here apply for the CIMB/Standard Chartered promo back in Nov?I got this email regarding my PS5 and they said they sent email early Jan but I checked and don‚Äôt have. :( anyone knows where to collect? Left a few days‚Ä¶.. emailed them hope they will respond.,btohqsg
Based on their website is 3.25% lol,btohqsg
You applied CIMB or standard chartered?,btohqsg
Hi Expert  is it more efficient to invest in the new Fullerton liquidity funds because the settlement date is T+0   with the guarantee 6.8%pa return promotion,btohqsg
does anyone know the mcc code for Marina Bay Hotel Pte Ltd?,btohqsg
i cant find it on that website,btohqsg
actually Marina Bay Hotel Pte Ltd merchant is for Mandarin Oriental Hotel. so i dun think it is this..,btohqsg
I think that legal entity is for mandarin oriental?,btohqsg
i think so.. thats why im trying to see wad is the MCC for it,btohqsg
There's a mandarin oriental intl but is a bar MCC. You booking hotel room?,btohqsg
Checking for HSBC Revo? Or UOB Lady‚Äôs?,btohqsg
Restaurant? Then could be same as bar MCC. 5813. Which is onheymax.ai.,btohqsg
Avoid ba. Else do DBS block card method. Or amaze block card method,btohqsg
Tell them you wanna use the right card and let you test. They‚Äôve nothing to lose and just be thick skin,btohqsg
Anyway hsbc revo $1k cap‚Ä¶. Not enough for wedding? You need multiple cards,btohqsg
yeah need to know the right mcc to know which cards to apply oso,btohqsg
Uob lady‚Äôs if you pick dining and travel sure cover either mcc. And $3k cap,btohqsg
is there a way to apply for that card? i havent reach the salary limit to apply for that,btohqsg
i do not have a uob acc as well,btohqsg
I ‚Äòthink‚Äô if you‚Äôve an existing card with them they‚Äôre not that strict on the requirement. Do a search on chats tho I might be wrong,btohqsg
ok i will try this method,btohqsg
Just try to apply UOB Lady's Solitaire only.. at most they reject for salary requirements lor,btohqsg
Charge $1 to your existing card n call CSO to find out the mcc will be the best. I believe your spend at this merchant will be huge. Be thick skin than sorry.,btohqsg
thanks for all the advice guys. cuz im totally do not have any cards/accounts opened with uob so not sure how this thing works. i will try to apply one UOB card 1st before applying the solitaire,btohqsg
Does anyone know if google play store in app purchases is eligible for 4mpd using citi rewards mc?,btohqsg
I also want to Enquiry use Apple ID bill iCloud can earn 4mpd using CRMC?,btohqsg
For Apple related charges  suggest to use Amaze + CRMC. I m not sure will get 4mpd.There are few data points that CRMC only give 0.4mpd for Apple related because no Amaze.,btohqsg
Also does Amaze + CRMC eligible for 4mpd using kris+ payment method for in store purchases?,btohqsg
Only for android yes until amaze added Apple Pay support,btohqsg
Thank you! Do you know if CRMC is eligible for 4mpd for google play store in app purchases?,btohqsg
I think it payment is via Google pay so might not work with CRMC directly,btohqsg
So it only works if linked to amaze.. got it! Thanks!,btohqsg

That is strange. I can login to their internet banking but cannot via their mobile app.,btohqsg
For UOB lady card  what category should I choose if often use online shopee ? Or there is no category for it to earn 6 miles per dollar,btohqsg
Centre point  short Q first floor,btohqsg

Anyone dbs altitude and dbs wwmc here? im quite confuse...can i confirn if buying flight ticket...dbs altitudr is the better card for earning miles?,btohqsg
Just check with the citi hotline. The inability to log in is via citi mobile apps only and not internet banking. Minimally 12 hours after maintenance one is able to log in,btohqsg
If u are using expedia then altitude is 6mpd  if not base is 1.3 mpd  dbs wwmc is 4mpd up to 2k,btohqsg
6mpd is only applicable to participating airlines  about 14 airlines. Details can be found in TnC.,btohqsg
Can I check. I have applied uob prvi miles card. As I'm new to uob and wanted to get the 50k sign up bonus miles.

But didn't get any confirmation.  Thanks In advance,btohqsg
I received uob prvi miles sign up bonus 25k UNI$can I just direct cancel it without reversal my point?I have another uob card as well like VS and lady,btohqsg
Mouse hunter have mention expedia only for 14 airline so do read through the tnc for exact airline and if it will suit your needs,btohqsg
Just keep for some time then cancel. If not might affect your rating with bank,btohqsg
Clarification. Have checked around  more than 2 peeps can log in the citi mobile apps. Have no idea why the svc citi peeps said that.,btohqsg
I'm trying to find a better credit card. Thinking about Citi or HSBC Revolution. Any suggestions or anything to consider? Thank you,btohqsg

Hi everyone. I plan to bring some MYR in my Maybank Malaysia account back to Singapore account ie in SGD. What's the most cost effective way to do this conversion and remittance? I do have a Maybank Singapore account. Soneone told me to use Wise but I'm not sure how this works.TIA,btohqsg
Are you Singaporean or Malaysian? Depending on your nationality it will affect which services you can use,btohqsg
Just like TikTok CEO  I'm a Singaporean,btohqsg
cimb my to cimb sg should work,btohqsg
My friend also suggested this but I don't have any CIMB account unfortunately,btohqsg
you can apply for both CIMB FastSavers SGD acc and CIMB AirAsia MYR acc at CIMB Raffles Place branch,btohqsg
then transfer your money from Maybank > CIMB MY > CIMB SG > Your local bank acc,btohqsg

Any method to pay yearly insurance for AIA  . I have only  both UOB Evol and UOB one debit card . Any other good card available?,btohqsg
HSBC Everyday Global Account gives 1% cashback on GIRO payments  it would be a good choice for cashback as AIA only accepts MC payments for recurring payments.For monthly recurring you can look into Maybank Platinum Visa with ipaymy/CardUp.,btohqsg
Anyone has the cimb 3.5 percent deposit. I have signed up since sep. Did the 3.5 percent interest promo stop already?,btohqsg

ok thanks . i see they give 1% on all giro  bill payment . i assume income tax   town council    and my AIA insurance is applicable . just saw your video on hsbc EGA :),btohqsg
but compared to the hsbc ega 1%    if using UOB evol cc   understand there is no cash rebate   only increase the bonus interest . which is still better ? HSBC ega or the UOB evol to use ?,btohqsg

Anyone knows of any credit card that can earn high miles for big ticket items above $10k in one single purchase ?,btohqsg
one of the conditions to earn uob one bonus interest rates is to spend $500  anyone knows when is the start and end date to spend that $500?isit 3rd of the month to the 3rd of the following month? (since interest is credited on 3rd),btohqsg
first day to last day of the month. try not to still spend on the last few days as fulfilment of your transactions may take a few days to update,btohqsg
Assuming you're already using UOB EVOL card  you're already hitting the minimum spend for cashback and bonus interest on UOB One account...,btohqsg
uob kf (pair with amaze) for the uncapped 3mpd based on the eligible MCC under the whitelist,btohqsg
Yes I am using uob evol right now to hit minimum 600 spending. OK thks,btohqsg
But the 3mpd is only applicable with min $800 annual spend on SIA  scoot and kris shop right ? If can't meet this requirement will only earn 1.2mpd right? Then its no difference from pairing amaze with citibank Premier miles card?,btohqsg
there are 4 platforms to tt money from malaysia instarem wise sunwaymoney and moneymatch. so far the cheapest rate is sunwaymoney and moneymatch. the rates are even more favourable than exchanging using cimb sg. suggest you open account with sunwaymoney as it is part of sunway group. all platforms hv bank negara license. if you have domestic MYR borrowings(more than 1 CC  housing loan and carloan) you can only transfer up to max of RM1million in aggregate per year,btohqsg

Or all card from stash account also consider for uob one account,btohqsg
I see zero on my card,btohqsg
But one challenge for stash account is keeping tracking the MAB. If it falls below for next month  you lose the bonus interest. My tot is use stash account for holding purpose  if got good promotions like FD with better rates  withdraw lump sum so you only lose for month and then put back one lump sum. That is my tots,btohqsg

Assuming you didn't touch a single cent in the account from 1st to 24th  for Feb 2024  you will meet the requirementjust on the dot  if your salary is $2584 (if salary credits earlier on 24th  since 25th is a Sunday) or $3875 (if salary credits late on 26th)  also only if you don't touch a single cent after salary credits.To help understanding MAB:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/167928,btohqsg
Hi all  Just for info. For the Maybank Platinium Visa card  they told me that to qualify for the $100 cashback  I need to clock$500 for Insurance  $500 on other spend to be eligible for the cashback... =(,btohqsg

Yes this was discussed when it was broadcasted in Oct 23.,btohqsg
Didn't know of the change... =(,btohqsg
Should have joined the group earlier üòõWelcome to the group.,btohqsg
Yes on the daily. That's why averagedailybalance.,btohqsg
What other cards can I use? I clock about $1k every month for insurance...,btohqsg
You can use ipaymy to clock 500 with a small fee. I'm testing this as we speak  just got the card last month.If this is your first quarter month (meaning your card was approved last month)  you can try this method. But if this is not your first quarter month  just forgo the next 2 months.,btohqsg
am thinking of using Citi PayAll instead...,btohqsg
You can get CRMC and earn miles when paying your insurance premiums with City PayAll. Pairing with Amaze card you can earn miles with better FX rates for overseas spending.,btohqsg
Good luck for your miles accumulation journey.If you still want to get cashback  can look into HSBC EGA for 1% cashback for GIRO payments  including insurance and non HSBC card payments.,btohqsg
Citipayall normal time is only the base rate of 0.4 mpd?,btohqsg
That's true. Alternatively@Mamoru202207can get Citi PremierMiles for 1.2mpd instead.,btohqsg
With City PayAll which you originally stated you are looking into,btohqsg

I was informed by Hsbc that insurance premiums paid via giro will not earn the 1% cashback for EGA account.Can anyone confirm this?,btohqsg
@jraphg96please check where you're sending your messages/pics.,btohqsg
There are always other way to go around that if it is true  just clock the insurance premium to any card directly/via axs or via cardup/ipaymy then giro the cc bill to hsbc,btohqsg
In my priority pass app  it shows expirws 24 Apr 2024. Does that means  it will be auto renewed next year?,btohqsg
As long as u hold the card it will auto renew after that date,btohqsg
How are you planning to pay for your insurance premiums? Using the HSBC banking website/app?,btohqsg

I will just pay insurance via AXS.  Consolidate all on my credit card then pay my card bills via EGa GIRO to get 1%,btohqsg
Currently on giro with UOB one account,btohqsg
??? Why would HSBC give you 1% cashback for you paying with GIRO on your UOB One account?,btohqsg
Thought of switching over to giro with hsbc ega acct if it gets that 1% cashback,btohqsg
Does transferring oa to sa and leaving 20k in oa works the same?,btohqsg
I thought only self initiated giro payments and giro payment for HSBC credit card will not get the 1% cashback on EGA? Should be be able to get 1% cadhback paying insurance premium  no?,btohqsg
Read clause 5 in their T&c.,btohqsg
Just to highlight that insurance is an exclusion for One Card for the Bonus.,btohqsg
That is referring to insurance premium on hsbc card? Not on ega giro.,btohqsg
From what I understood  1% cashback not given if you charge the premium to HSBC credit card,btohqsg
Back to my questions again.1. Are you planning to pay through HSBC bank website/app?2. Are you planning to pay using HSBC EG debit card or personal credit card  not via GIRO?,btohqsg
Should be able to get 1% cashback if you pay premium via giro from HSBC ega,btohqsg
Want to find out whether  i can get 1% cashback if i giro my premiums thru ega acct,btohqsg

As long as his RA is below FRS  any amounts topped up to his RA is eligible for tax relief (up to 8k). Topping up his RA also increases his monthly payouts.,btohqsg

Hi. May i ask the experts here regarding RSTU. If my SA is at $200K now  can i top up $5 800 to hit the FRS $205 800 in Feb 24  and be granted tax relief?Or will they decide the tax relief for the $5 800 at 31 Dec 24? Which means i may not get the tax relief because by July/Aug 24  I would have hit the FRS,btohqsg
You cannot do RSTU to your SA the moment CPF mandatory contributions cause it to hit FRS. Any RSTU before will still be valid and benefit from tax relief.,btohqsg

Anyone has any experience from previous promotions? Do I top up 500sgd in usd amount? Or just keep it as 150k usd,btohqsg
I usually place in SGD to avoid FX fluctuations since it is the same yield anyway at 6.8% p.a.,btohqsg
Hahha yeah I put in usd cause I brought it out of ibkr for this cycleThe last cycle 5.8% I used sgd,btohqsg
And I intend to bring it back to usd in ibkr after the 60days is up. Because us stocks. So currency fluctuation doesn't matter to me because I need the end product to be usd anyway for us stocks,btohqsg
It didn't make sense for me to exchange to sgd and then back to usd at the end of the campaign that's all,btohqsg

Can I ask:If I transfer my  OA to my husband‚Äôs SA (monthly to help him reach his FRS in 4 years) will he still be able to withdraw excess from his SA/oa at the age 55 if he has achieved his FRS by then or is this transferred money considered ‚Äôshielded‚Äô therefore part of the unwithdrawable?,btohqsg
You cannot do that in the first place lolAre you talking about RSTU instead?,btohqsg
I have been transferring my oa to my husband‚Äôs SA.,btohqsg

Now I know that whatever excess he has apart from FRS  he can withdraw freely after 55 from SA/oa.Question is does that also include the money I transferred to him..,btohqsg
Yes. Contactless and Online works for me.,btohqsg

Hi all experts. Which card is more worth for daily spending OCBC Rewards Card or Infinity CC?I need to pay ntuc insurance but I think both card won‚Äôt offer any promo.. my monthly spending is about 500 and won‚Äôt be more than 550note: I have uob one acc with 500 spend every month so looking for another card for spending,btohqsg
Depends on your daily spending pattern. If you can make most of those transactions fall under the 4mpd categories of rewards card  then it is better. If not  then infinity is better.But in any case  you're comparing a specialised spend miles card vs a general spend cashback card  so it's not really a clean comparison.,btohqsg
I see. Can I confirm the miles is must tag into amaze or anything to earn?,btohqsg
You must match the bonus categories criteria to get the 4mpdhttps://www.ocbc.com/iwov-resources/sg/ocbc/personal/pdf/cards/tnc-titaniumrewards-creditcard-programme-wef-1nov23.pdf,btohqsg

OA to spouse SA is reserved  unlike self OA-SA is unreserved funds,btohqsg

Not sure where to share this for awareness so I post multiple places.I tried to use my amaze at Ueno family mart.I used human A amaze with paywave.

Success of course.After I left family mart  1 minute later I got notification human A amaze transaction went through. Amaze points credited lol.I hurriedly went back to the family mart but they kept claiming (luckily there was a chinese speaking cashier) that their credit card machine has no records of any recent transactions. Ask me to call my bank.I was only given a copy of a more detailed receipt which showed Suica transaction was successful by family mart.I immediately chat with amaze and they will raise an investigation. Amount is small at $15 and my best guess is merchant will not claim the credit card funds and it will be auto released after 7-14 days.Imagine if this had been a large transaction what would u do?,btohqsg

Hi  would like to ask on CPF SA shielding method. If let say SA already at FRS (not all amount under reserved) but i would like to still be able to enjoy 8k relief annually. Can I shield my SA 8k then top up SA 8k annually for tax relief?,btohqsg
If you hit FRS  you can no longer top up to your SA via RSTU. So you cannot get more tax relief.You can continue to top up your MA if you still have allowance as well as top up your loved ones.CPF shielding is done at age of 55 so not sure what your question is actually.,btohqsg
So for those who had gone for the OA transfer to SA method  the cons is that they can't enjoy the $8k tax relief in their later stage of life.,btohqsg
Invested amounts for SA are calculated as part of the RSTU cap if that's what you're asking.,btohqsg
What i mean is to reduce SA to be below FRS (investing out) and then top up SA using cash for tax relief. But not sure if this can be done üòÖ,btohqsg
Once SA hit FRS  then cannot get tax relief on top up to self SA. But the money in SA can effectively compound at max. You can explore other tax relief like1) top up your own MA to BHS2) top up loved ones SA/RA (rstu)3) top up to SRS account,btohqsg
If you have cannot get tax relief from CPF topups (VCMA/RSTU) anymore  you can look into topping up SRS and investing it.,btohqsg
You will not be able to reduce by investing your SA account. Dun think there is any known loop hole on this. üòÖ,btohqsg
Ah ok..so investing out doesnt reduce the total amount. Got it. Thank youüôè,btohqsg

How to subscribe to this? I am an existing users n have participate in last year 5.8 promo. But I don't see this new 6.8 promo on the promotion page on moomoo app,btohqsg
I would say moomoo has the best offer now at 6.8% p.a. do note investment risk still applies,btohqsg
Ohh so not suppose to be from the app. But from this link?,btohqsg
I see it on my app  but for some it doesnt appear on app.,btohqsg
Got it. Hmm  should confirm with customer service after registration or we will be notify in d app that we r registered for d promo,btohqsg
Click Me at the bottom of the apps  G√≤ to promotion,btohqsg
Hopefully  you subscribed exact amount. If you subscribed more or less than the indicated amount  you may not get the promised rewards. Eg. $760.I subscribed $88k for 60++ days on 5.8% which is $760.During the 60 days  I received $574.77 of total revenue.After first appeal  moomoo gave me $87 cash coupon.After second appeal  moomoo gave me another $40 cash coupon.Total rewards I received is only $574.77 + $87 + $40 =$701.77for $88k of Fullerton cash fund subscriptions. Less than $760 of what moomoo promised.Currently  trying third appeal.,btohqsg
This is the one I participated.,btohqsg
In this case  is moomoo not fulfilling their obligation? Since it‚Äôs mentioned that the returns are guaranteed and ‚Äúmoomoo will make up the difference‚Äù?,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt know can appeal. I also found the interest payout below the 5.8%,btohqsg
Different promo different minimum. Pls check latest ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù.,btohqsg
I have no comments on this. Still waiting for moomoo to give me explanation why i did not receive $760 although I subscribed more than $80k for more than 60 days.,btohqsg

$200 eCapitalvouchers without annual fee payment is one of the best from Amex so far right? Anyone seen cashback or rewards more than $200 without annual fee payment?,btohqsg
Yes.For my case  I only earn $500++ from the fund. Moomoo shall top the remaining to $760. Furthermore I had additional $8k subscribed to cash fund which is $8k. My return shall be more than $810 in total.,btohqsg
Kinda sad. Thought they should topup 238. Based on what you earn just with 80k.,btohqsg
I have same problem too. Fund return only 500+. No cash coupon issued for shortfall. When I make noise they claimed that they will issue a coupon manually. Received after few days but was only 21. Called to complain again and they say will get manager to call me but never received any call. Called Moomoo again today  they say will issue me another cash coupon on 200+. Not received yet. Not sure if this will happen,btohqsg
This is quite upsetting as it has taken more than 3 weeks and still not resolved.,btohqsg
Likely The manager failed in High school Mathematics. Promised guaranteed $760 return n they even don‚Äôt know that their calculation is less than $760 n only $500++. ü§Ø,btohqsg
I have some doubts over this campaign. And not sure should participate in the latest 6.8%. Unless u monitored  feel Moomoo kind of not being honest.,btohqsg
Not sure how many people out there did not check their return n if it is correct. Hope this will raise awareness.,btohqsg
I have the same experience too. Have to appeal to get back the shortfall,btohqsg

Happy CNY everyone  I have an interactive brokers account  and I also have an Australian bank account domiciled in Australia. I was wondering what is the most cost efficient way of depositing USD into my interactive brokers account from my Australian bank account - 2 ways I can think of. My IB account is a singapore IB account and I am Singaporean. Thanks for the help!1. Transfer from Australian bank to sg bank using wise  then deposit into IB and convert SGD to USD2. Deposit from australian bank account to IB  then convert AUD to USD,btohqsg
My IBKR account is us ib account but I think the mechanics should be the same. They should be using a us based account to custodise the usd cash.The key is to find a sending bank that doesn‚Äôt charge for sending usd into a us bank based in us.You didn‚Äôt specify if your Australia bank account is usd or aud? And which bank is it?Anyway looking at your situation I would say the best way is to remit aud directly from your Australia bank into ib. I‚Äôm sure they accept aud cash. Then do a fx convert for $2 in ib into usd if u wish.,btohqsg

Is anyone using Maybank for day to day transactions Iike pay now or banking transfers?I have a human on Maybank who keeps getting tricked to pay now or transfer out from creditable account when there is sufficient funds from their savings account.Apparently in Maybank lite app  the default account selected is creditable account and you need to scroll your phone down manually to see the account being selected / change account.And the most stupid thing is you are able to proceed with the transfer without even sighting which is the account u are transferring out from.This has caused my human to be penalised with minimum $5 overdraft interest per month on a few instances just for paying friends say $10 for lunch.Very irritating and even when calling into Maybank the officer wasn‚Äôt able to provide a solution on how to set the default account to be a savings account and not a credit able account. Duh. Which idiot would transfer money out from credit able when they have money in savings account.Obviously an app design flaw or an intentional trap by Maybank.,btohqsg
If they look the same to you  you need better glasses üòÇ,btohqsg
The maybank lite app is trash.. it feels like it's made for kids or something,btohqsg
But they force u to use Maybank lite for paynow to friends.They intentionally disabled paynow on the main Maybank app.,btohqsg
The officer say until so easy.Oh u just have to make sure u choose the correct account before u paynow.But it defaults to creditable. How stupid is that.I think the only way out is to cancel credit able,btohqsg
Yes  insurance not excluded in T&Cs,btohqsg
Check the T&C see if it‚Äôs excluded,btohqsg
Hi guys  does the oneself transfer salary by paynow to uob one still works?,btohqsg
POSB / DBS excludes AMAZE* transactions so you won't earn any rewards  and the spread is worse.,btohqsg
Anyone has any SG stock market group to recommend,btohqsg

Has anyone here tried transferring FROM Maybank Malaysia bank account TO Maybank Singapore account? From website  there's no agent bank. Not sure about other fees and FX rate. Another alternative is Wise  I guess,btohqsg
I tried maybank msia to maybank sg. Not bad. Small fees is needed. Maybe fx rate not that good compared to you trip or ichange or money changer. It is just convenience to transfer in non cash method,btohqsg
Hi   checking out with those who make regular purchases on shopee  whether it is worth to apply for mari bank? I saw there are daily mari vouchers to use when checking out the cart.

How long ago the 'accidental' paynow transactions via creditable account happen?Try asking Maybank forfees waiverwith the basis as their lite app 'not intuitive' by rephrasing the account u wrote here as a feedback to maybank as consideration to enhance their Lite app for avoidance of spend accidentally becoming a overdraft transaction  leading to negative customer perception üòä,btohqsg
Btw I have searched thru mari bank at the chat but not much discussion been done. Hence  wonder if it's not worth to sign up mari bank.,btohqsg
Calculate if the vouchers more worth than the credit card rewards. Or if you need the spending from shopee to clock minimum spend for cashback/bonus interest.I'm assuming you're already using a high interest account like UOB One or OCBC 360.,btohqsg
