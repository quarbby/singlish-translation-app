Seeking feedback/advise on car paint protection coating.Currently I have the TitaniumSH coating applied. In future  if I want to use other type of ceramic coating  do I need to get the new vendor to remove the old coating first? Or new ceramic coating can be applied over the old coating?,btohqsg
see how long ur coating suppose to last,btohqsg
esp if u park under the sun,btohqsg
I understand coating doesn't last forever. My question was if need to remove the old coat first or just inform the guy about it and let them settle it before they apply new (different) ceramic coat.,btohqsg
It's gone when the next shop does polishing,btohqsg
Hi üëãMy car having issues with ants üêúAny suggestions to eliminate them ?,btohqsg
Tsk next time don‚Äôt eat in car,btohqsg
From top to bottom clear everything,btohqsg
The implied meaning is.. after its gone its gone.. cus before coating they will polish one time. So whatever coating u have.. also gone w the coating.. but just make a mental note of when ur coating supposedly suppose to end,btohqsg
I put ant gel for awhile,btohqsg
You'll need to visit a shop that specialise in removing such pests (ants/cockroaches). They will usually smoke them out then do a full internal cleaning.,btohqsg
Thanks for feedback. It's hard to gauge when the existing will be worn off. Guess I'll just inform the shop before they do their coating work. Thanks,btohqsg
U put water see does it stay,btohqsg
And whether ur door handles got crying marks,btohqsg
I use water to dry it,btohqsg
Er ur door handles there usually if it rains or whatever..,btohqsg
Before coating alot. After coating dont have. When coating wearing off  it‚Äôll come back,btohqsg
Sometimes got the stain near door handles or behind or wherever lah,btohqsg
something worser than this but yes this,btohqsg
No I don't. I just have lots of small light scratches,btohqsg
then ur coating shud be fine?,btohqsg
Something like this. Once every 6 months I have to bring car back to shop for them to polish it. Thankfully it's free.,btohqsg
u ownself wash car or use automated wash ah,btohqsg
I have no idea how those 'scratch' marks come about as I don't even those outside of those areas. It's on all 4 door handles and I don't ferry ppl around  so I only touch driver side door handle.,btohqsg
I can understand if it's only at driver side handle to have scratches.,btohqsg
I remember reading somewhere before that because of that curved recessed portion for the handles  wind ‚Äúcuts‚Äù in and sometimes with very fine debris  it will scratch the surface of the car. I don‚Äôt know how true it is though,btohqsg
got fine particles in the air,btohqsg
i mean if pebbles hit u  u will know,btohqsg
but sometimes very fine dust or whatever u cant see it nor feel it,btohqsg
but that's my take on the scratches,btohqsg
But for these micro scratches  I used to use toothpaste and it magically removes it. Currently using Soft99 and also gets rid of all these fine scratches,btohqsg
Toothpaste any toothpaste also can HAHA.,btohqsg
I bought it at Esso last year,btohqsg
