If we all fail it becomes a systemic risk and the schools problem,btohqsg
Exams are regulated by OAS although it's a convened board decision which is made mostly of Profs it's also very much skewed to administrative sensitivities too,btohqsg
no need to tell me all that,btohqsg
For the administration they actually do. If all fail means retake and u gotta accommodate the entire cohort,btohqsg
More headache as u gotta scale it up and find more ppl,btohqsg
i think writing on the ipad too much is making me disoriented with real life,btohqsg

Driving centres probably easing up on who they're giving their licenses to,btohqsg

idt anyone other than the admissions officer wld know this,btohqsg
if i don received any news hor i could still wait for the second window right,btohqsg
by that time i wld start considering alternative plans alr,btohqsg
although i wouldn't hold out much hope for appealing,btohqsg
icc i alre got offer from ntu,btohqsg
just that i prefer nus and smu,btohqsg
wld u rather NTU or not have a uni spot,btohqsg
if NUS dun accept then next year try again,btohqsg

if still cmi then the year after try again,btohqsg
i got SMU offer a different year and i cld accept if i wanted to,btohqsg

if you play your cards right can grad in 2.5,btohqsg
i sort of prefer like longer uni life for some reason,btohqsg
depends on what you want to do in uni ig,btohqsg
u can alw underload in ntu and do 4 years,btohqsg
HAHAHA yea thats wat i was thinking also,btohqsg
u think about it ah NTU 3 year + 1 year LOA vs SMU/NUS 4 years + 1 year LOA,btohqsg
up to you la but unless you think NUS/SMU academic wise stronger  imo no reason to not go NTU,btohqsg
(and biz academic standing aso not much use lol),btohqsg
act ye but curious also ah why u didn choose to go smu,btohqsg
is it cause of the shorter grad ah,btohqsg
personal reasons aside  shorter grad  easier to get hall (for that#hallife),btohqsg
yea i also wanted hall life,btohqsg
i can grad in 2.5 years,btohqsg
what are ur objectives though in uni,btohqsg
but i know ppl in ntu biz who underload every sem,btohqsg
so they can stay in uni for longer,btohqsg
