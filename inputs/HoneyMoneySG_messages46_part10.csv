Hi everyone . Does anyone knows For uob prvimiles the foreign eligible spending follows the same spending as local eligible spending ?,btohqsg
As in exclusions for the 2.4mpd for foreign spend? If so  yes.,btohqsg
sorry but i dont understand what you said.....,btohqsg
Does paying using citi rewards on ShopBack gets 4mpd?,btohqsg
Perhaps you may want to be more specific on where you plan to buy the grocery voucher. Just donâ€™t want to end up it is MCC 6540.,btohqsg
Hmm Giant or Shengshiong can? Main goal is to hit the 1k min spend within one month for the luggage promo ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Not sure. I heard eCapitaVoucher is 6540 n not counted.,btohqsg
On a related note  HSBC have rejected my giro forms not once  not twice  but three time!!! I am going to pretend not to speak or understand English  go down to a physical branch  get their banker to fill in my form and then if anything goes wrong I will blame their staff...,btohqsg
Did they tell you why reject?,btohqsg
Wrong signature and wrong account number. So I need to go down to resolve no other way maybe my signature needs to be 100% perfect all the dots and slashes must align,btohqsg
I think hsbc is just being difficult but I might be wrong  any hsbc back office staff feel free to weigh in,btohqsg
Signature is very important n must be correct. You donâ€™t want other people to easily forge your signature and deduct money from your HSBC account  right?,btohqsg
If just a signature is needed to do high value transfers then HSBC have bigger problems than me...,btohqsg
From a legal standpoint  and I might be wrong  an initial or a drawing of a poop on the signature line is acceptable.https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/legally-use-e-signatures-singapore-contracts/,btohqsg
Assuming u referring to the usual rewards points earning on uob prvimiles  spending are eligible for rewards points so long not in the exclusion list in the Terms and Conditions. Eligible spending in foreign currency earns more points but incur 3.25% foreign exchange fee.,btohqsg
People from the bank are working for those who were born in 1950s so I must act like a boomer and use thumbprint if I have to,btohqsg
hi pros  may i know which cards are the best for buying air tickets to get miles/cashback?,btohqsg
For savings accounts like uob one and ocbc360  is there a way to check what effective interest rates youâ€™re getting? Or can you only assume youâ€™re hitting the requirements and getting the rates.,btohqsg
UOB one has a interest calculator on their webpage,btohqsg
Hi  can i consolidate my income tax and wife income and pay via hers/my citipayall arrangement? instead of separating it// else unable to hit the 8k min sum,btohqsg
Can track your salary credit and card spend requirement in the app,btohqsg
Lol I managed to bully the counter staff to help me fill in the giro form. But I'm a paikai who is fed up with banks,btohqsg
The banks have like 5-6 counters yet only 1 person serving customers,btohqsg
Why bother with retail money if they don't want to provide services then?,btohqsg
If only I can run a hospital with 1 nurse and Dr serving patients the others can make appt or die for all I care,btohqsg
That is normal  many even tellU to go away without appt or give u dirty look,btohqsg
They should give up the license let better player take over,btohqsg
the giro form is to fill in at hsbc? but how come uob passed me their giro form instead? uob credit cards  to arrange giro for another bank,btohqsg
I even got  UOB staff shake their head and sneer at me at the branches  tell me go online do  but online not working ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
i didnt tell uob staff which account. they just passed me their giro form  and asked me to fill in the account i wanna giro from,btohqsg
I ranted at an RM until she give up with me. I said even you don't put money in UOB you want me to put?,btohqsg
Untimely it will go back to the bank which account you are deducting from to sit on it collect dust for 2 months. Before they reject you ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So 3 mths later I still haven't setup anything with hsbc,btohqsg
Is the Singsaver promo for Citibank cards which gives either iPad  Nintendo Switch  Dyson vacuum or cash still available? Is it applicable to specific card only? I want to apply Citibank Rewards MC but it seems only 40 000 Thank You points mentioned at Singsavers site via HMSG link which is the same welcome gift as Citibank website,btohqsg
Nowadays walk in branches dont want to  deal with normal customers   only privilege or wealth banking then will politely entertain u,btohqsg
Baby already finished 1st trimester yet nothing accomplished at hsbc,btohqsg
Don't bother with them. I not so stupid put money there for them buy ILP,btohqsg
I try to have $0AUM with retail banks,btohqsg
ohhh i know what u mean now. so i submit giro form to uob is just step 1. so your current stage is step 2 (the giro form is passed to hsbc for processing).... ok  i hv yet to reach tt stage yet ... hopefully everything will be fine ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
The UOB stage very fast 1-2 days then they send to HSBC make cake,btohqsg
Citi singsaver offer is paused from today for cashback(+)  rewards,btohqsg
But for premiermiles ipad/switch/dyson still available,btohqsg
Then should I wait for the promo to resume? Any idea?,btohqsg
Is there any other way to indirectly use credit card for PayNow QR besides using Grab app?,btohqsg
Depending on the QR code payment available at the stores  you can try using Xnap  Favepay  shopback pay and Kris+. I think Chris has a video on QR code payment recently so you should check it out.,btohqsg
Fave pay link to UOB Evol  count as eligible online spend (for 8% cash back)?,btohqsg
Up to you. If you just want the gifts  can just do PremierMiles card first. No guarantee that the same gifts will resume next month,btohqsg
