Meanwhile i died planning the trip this yr and last yr,btohqsg
i went to the area affected by the earthquake like,btohqsg
the day i fly back to sg,btohqsg
but i fly from diff airport,btohqsg
At this rate maybe i will go japan nonstop,btohqsg
U went alone or w fam,btohqsg

Something i hv never learnt my lesson is the watching train timing,btohqsg
Every trip will hv some train boo boo,btohqsg
How much was each trip btw,btohqsg
Same i will be so lost also,btohqsg
i got 3 main things to do one,btohqsg
- buy yarn- go look at anime stuff- food,btohqsg
my fam went insanely ham for me,btohqsg
For me something i struggle w is budget coz in japan  almost all attractions hv fee,btohqsg
I wish can go japan but scared too ex,btohqsg
And then if u care too much  everything also dunnid do liao💀💀,btohqsg
we got group tour package  was like i forgot how many k per person sia,btohqsg
but urr lets just say ah,btohqsg
For me we splurged on food and then my sis likes to buy lots of nonsense,btohqsg
Oh i went free n easy,btohqsg
my fam didnt cuz we all dunno nihongo,btohqsg
i only pick up a few words cuz of anime so,btohqsg
Prev yr my mum spent alot of dior coz it is much cheaper there,btohqsg
My fam gave me pressure to be the japan translator💀💀But omo if cannot  we just take phone google translate,btohqsg
i went and buy abit of like make up n skincare stuff,btohqsg
I cant travel alone and its hard for my mom to get leave so hard to travel much,btohqsg
This aspect im damn lazy abt but when start working  i need to take more care of my skin,btohqsg
Usually just go to my moms hometown in hainan,btohqsg
the only way i can prolly travel alone without my parents go wacko me,btohqsg
Ok but i think my 2023 japan trip avg per person is around $2.67k??,btohqsg
Not as bad as i expected,btohqsg
i can probably go visit my moms hometown at malaysia,btohqsg
if i go anywhere else alone,btohqsg
If i travel i think need at least 2 weeks,btohqsg
i gonna work hard aft As,btohqsg
then save up for that japan trip before uni starts bah,btohqsg
Dont rly have relatives in malaysia so i nvr go before,btohqsg
I see ig like almost everyone goes japan,btohqsg
Well i technically do but i dont like them,btohqsg
ya + probably can make money from crochet also,btohqsg
i unironically got commission lined up alrd,btohqsg
like my friend say she willing to pay me to make a bag,btohqsg
+ im v particular w airlines  so i need to work hard to get whay i want,btohqsg
i alrd tell her wont be cheap,btohqsg
Coz SQ and ANA arent that cheap,btohqsg
But ANA is actually cheaper than scoot lol,btohqsg
And their economy class seat is same size as SQ premium economy,btohqsg
Im too lazy to search all the flight prices,btohqsg
i mean no big deal for me if i go malaysia cuz that flights literally,btohqsg
I actually hv scoot trauma already,btohqsg
Yea short flights i just heck care,btohqsg
cuz my sleep got messed up asf,btohqsg
Bruh my sis was sleeping on my shoulder,btohqsg
i on 2 cups of coffee a day,btohqsg
Meanwhile i asked for beer on the flight,btohqsg
I wanted sapporo beer  but asked at the wrong time,btohqsg
The worst thing that could happen is,btohqsg
true story: one of my uncle drank beer on a flight to thailand..he was so drunk he got into a police van thinking it was a taxi when he landed,btohqsg
My pe**** came on the flight,btohqsg
I usually only considered a few,btohqsg
Not only on the flight  but at 3-4am ish where the cabin is all dark,btohqsg
Hopefully this time i go i get to ride ard in the moped thing,btohqsg
i lregit thought that would be a gude reaction lmfao,btohqsg
Kinda sucks covid was during sec 1 sec 2 for me😭😭😭,btohqsg
When i cld spare to travel,btohqsg
when you realise covid in total took 4 yrs out of everybody's life to fully recover and get the world back to normal,btohqsg
And then when i went to the toilet  idk why the plane was shaking so it wasnt a pleasant experience,btohqsg
Happened during what shld have been the peak of my youth,btohqsg
i think when can go overseas again ah,btohqsg
the most poignant change is the 14 yr olds..who are now 18,btohqsg
during dec hols for 2022 i think,btohqsg
mine was not too bad 16-20,btohqsg
Did u travel during ur sec 3 dec holi,btohqsg
whats funny is alot of ppl forgot what they did in 2019,btohqsg
just that we start j2 1 week later than sec sch thats all,btohqsg
Uk ANA flight crew is all female,btohqsg
Their male staff all ground duties apparently,btohqsg
Idt i can cus nearing any big exam im not in the state to enjoy holiday,btohqsg
i go both malaysia n taiwan,btohqsg
Ye after o levels is a giveb,btohqsg
Idk im in love w japan,btohqsg
Wildest use of school email ever. Protest about racial harmony act thing but the letter not about the act lol,btohqsg
I at first tot they no male staff at all,btohqsg
Then i recently saw on ig apparently their male staff all ground duties,btohqsg
Taiwan shld be cheaper then japan right,btohqsg
Google says it will reach 125 at the end of the yr,btohqsg
bruh once i go jpn again,btohqsg
gonna see me hoard make up n skincare back to sg,btohqsg
This time the weakest yen i got was 116.312,btohqsg
Which part of japan u planning to go,btohqsg
honestly plan is just tokyo rn,btohqsg
For me it is royce and kit kat and jpn snacks,btohqsg
cuz i also gotta consider the fact,btohqsg
so tokyo would be more safe in a sense,btohqsg
Seems like a huge headache ngl,btohqsg
Dior’s deal is as good as $50+ cheaper💀💀,btohqsg
nearly $100 for a tote bag,btohqsg
i have no real plans rn,btohqsg
i prolly can start daydreaming abt it tho,btohqsg
Surprisingly hokkaido staff can speak good english,btohqsg
watch me dedi a whole ass day for,btohqsg
I wish i hv such coz i hate planning,btohqsg
I can take vvvvv long to plan,btohqsg
I think i wld too ngl,btohqsg
But this trip my dad provided a backbone coz i hv the excuse of studying for exams lol,btohqsg
We freaking spent $14k ¥ in donki,btohqsg
my sis like idk shopping like crazy and using parents money on friends be like💀💀,btohqsg
I remembered the first trip to osaka  we even went donki twice,btohqsg
I got conned tho coz i didnt know Hokkaido has pokemon ctr and actually paid $4 more in donki for sth for a friend,btohqsg
Of all places pokemon ctr in daimaru???,btohqsg
Another place we spend on is uniqlo,btohqsg
The first trip idk how but our uniqlo expense was like $300 — 30000¥,btohqsg
"Anyway i shld probly sleep and stop the delulu as im still stuck in ""feels like 42c"" everytime i open the weather app",btohqsg
Then end up get scolded by my dad for not taking into acct the location💀💀,btohqsg
Oso my arm is now sore from banging into my closest,btohqsg
Has anyone went for summer school before and is it worth the money,btohqsg
Like for people who graduated from jc alr ig?,btohqsg
Its a jc thing ig but not manu people know abt it ig,btohqsg
I'm literally gonna write an article abt ponning sch,btohqsg
But it's gonna stay as a joke article for my friends la,btohqsg
I alm defo can't publish it under my sch proj,btohqsg
real those days where they do absolutely nothing,btohqsg
May look bad in your college app,btohqsg
But I think it's gonna be a,btohqsg
Joke article for my friends thats it,btohqsg
Maybe u cam like anonymously HAHA,btohqsg
Also m surprised ocbc branch is open on sunday,btohqsg
If only they have default design,btohqsg
Train services at the Punggol and Sengkang LRT stations have been down since 5.45am due to a signalling fault.Free regular and bridging bus services are available at designated bus stops near affected stations and at Sengkang Bus Interchange.https://str.sg/mwwc,btohqsg
school for rich kids to boost their EC,btohqsg
Im so envious why are people overseas 4ever,btohqsg
I'm gg back to indo next fri,btohqsg
Like they are overseas like 1m or longer (with or without gap in between),btohqsg
Can i seek some opinion.Basically my aunt is single leaving w my grandma and uncle (both kinda sick la)Then she complain that she is in this alone nd not allowed to go overseas becoz of her home commitments and blah blah whereas she didnt bother us (me n my cousin’s fam) that goes overseas during holidays enjoying ourselves whereas she cant.Idk if it is oh our fault for going overseas or like she is being unreasonable,btohqsg
Hell no imo OCBC is too ancient a lot of banking stuff I need to actually only do it at the branch,btohqsg
Speaking of exchange  i actually regret not applying for it (coz mine was only summer / winter exchange allowed),btohqsg
1 month I think is the limit for most tourist visas,btohqsg
U start to get into issues liao cuz u aren't supposed to stay so long,btohqsg
And for holiday exchange  only hv canada  germany  i cant rmb the other europe countries  and korea,btohqsg
Neh my Japan visa was 4m,btohqsg
As in some of them hv breaks in between but they seem to he travelling alot,btohqsg
4m is like really pushing it and idk what u are supposed to do for 4 months as a tourist.,btohqsg
And some ppl kena caned for being an overstayer💀💀,btohqsg
Also to maintain tax residency in SG u gotta stay at least 1 month in SG per year,btohqsg
Also months where u get the money lmao tourist visa cannot work one,btohqsg
Isn't japan just a visa waiver? I think its 90 days for sg passport in japan; many countries give 15-90 days for singaporeans,btohqsg
Ok my 4ever is not really 4ever…but just ya for long periods of time,btohqsg
May - Aug is still 3 months lol not 4,btohqsg
Idk why but my passport rote May - Aug (which is 4m),btohqsg
May 10 - Aug 10 for example would be 3 months,btohqsg
Wait ya it is 3m  my brain has not waken up,btohqsg
Gotta have a lot of capital basically also looks suspicious for immigration,btohqsg
I think US will deny entry if you stay for max number of days too often...,btohqsg
No like they are overseas for ard 1/2m to 1m (like either 1 trip or separate trips add up),btohqsg
Isn't that quite normal for dec holidays,btohqsg
My family holidays usually only 10-15d,btohqsg
Anybody knows a daily pay job?,btohqsg
But erm it is May-June now💀💀,btohqsg
I think Banquet jobs are daily pay too,btohqsg
Uh... some ppl visit family too which might take up entire jun hols,btohqsg
Gude why u thumbs down me,btohqsg
Then maybe they're just loaded haha,btohqsg
I thought holiday usually got alot of job eh,btohqsg
But that means they also hv a lot of cash (either parents sponsor or somehow they hv a lot of cash),btohqsg
Daily pay is usually this kind one,btohqsg
I hv a friend whose parents rich  buy him sq business class tickets (at least $10k),btohqsg
Or they play the mileage run game and get 2 holidays for the price of 1,btohqsg
Neh theirs is free n easy not on tour,btohqsg
You buy cheap business class tickets and accrue more miles than you actually spend money,btohqsg
Then use said miles to go for another holiday,btohqsg
The opposite ngl holiday will flood with Students looking for gigs,btohqsg
Most ppl do not use hacks coz it is not supposed to be the case,btohqsg
Idk about the market now but a yr or two ago it was 500/$80,btohqsg
Idk why he so obsessed with flying atas,btohqsg
These are not hacks  they are made under normal ticket fares which are simply available only thru diy,btohqsg
Meanwhile i heard that if i work in clinical  they will prioritise those w family to take leave in dec💀💀💀,btohqsg
But they are published in the gds for all to see,btohqsg
Go make a family lor 💀,btohqsg
Neh if im a doctor i think leave not a problem  doctor has infinite power,btohqsg
Because its better than flying economy for the same price,btohqsg
Im obsessed w flying ANA and SQ,btohqsg
And its fun to see people who paid more than you trudge their way back into economy,btohqsg
Meanwhile did u read the article about tokyo govt creating the date apps to increase birthrates,btohqsg
Funnily enough Tokyo doesn't need that,btohqsg
It doesn't work. Singapore's government gave up long ago when they tore down sdu,btohqsg
It's other parts of Japan that need to increase birth rates as the migration to Tokyo increases the population,btohqsg
Yeah and gov give free vouchers for ppl who wanna date,btohqsg
Oh tokyo has the highest migration?,btohqsg
Yeah it's the only Japanese city with an increasing population,btohqsg
Can sign up if want subsidized meal from ah gong,btohqsg
The city areas of Japan (eg osaka and tokyo) are still q crowded,btohqsg
So idk why they want to increase birth rates at this juncture,btohqsg
Because a lot of them are tourists who are just passing through,btohqsg
And ANA economy class seats are actually q comfy and bigger / more leg rm than SQ,btohqsg
By right is increasing rates in the urban/rural areas,btohqsg
And they aren't as accepting of immigrants as Singapore,btohqsg
SQ economy has one of the most narrowest seats,btohqsg
Narrow on 787  wide on 777/a380,btohqsg
On 777/a380 sq has 19 inch seat width  which is on par with premium econ on other airlines,btohqsg
Yeah but the hub is different lor,btohqsg
I didnt really pay attn to what plane i was on until recently where my dad was avoiding old planes,btohqsg
Old planes are actually more comfortable though. The newer slimline seats are the notoriously uncomfortable ones,btohqsg
Thank a german company called 'recaro' for this 'innovation',btohqsg
It is coz most planes flying from HND - hokkaido are 20+ y/o,btohqsg
They actually have a wayyy longer service life than that,btohqsg
Safety  maybe. But I trust sq engineering,btohqsg
After Passenger service they just get sold as Cargo planes to FedEx or DHL,btohqsg
The old seats were much nicer and more comfortable,btohqsg
I think ANA economy has the biggest leg rm,btohqsg
"Even the ""premium"" slimline seats sq uses are very thin and uncomfortable  no padding and lumbar support",btohqsg
Yes. And in the us  jetblue has the best legroom,btohqsg
Somehow im actually missing hearing and speaking japanese,btohqsg
You can make chinese sound like japanese ngl,btohqsg
I dun speak chinese (only to my grandma)💀💀💀,btohqsg
Idk I whenever I go overseas it's always funny when they speak to me either in Korea or Japanese,btohqsg
Then I stare back at em in confusion,btohqsg
Most ppl speak to me in japanese,btohqsg
Only place where they speak english was on my ANA flight back,btohqsg
Coz i believe most passengers on the flight were singaporeans,btohqsg
Cos chinese sinkies dont look that diff from japanese,btohqsg
But tbh in surprised by hokkaido’s english standards,btohqsg
"I think on the whole  nodding and saying ""hai"" at appropriate moments is enough for a lot of things in Japan",btohqsg
Even the hotel check in the agent start off with Jap or Korean,btohqsg
Then when I looked confused she immediately switch to english,btohqsg
Usually when i say sorry or sth  they will switch to english,btohqsg
Yea i can agree w that,btohqsg
Like omo dun tell me u dunno what they are asking on the plane even if it is in japanese,btohqsg
Eh I just give them my passport and paid up reservation and goはいはいはい,btohqsg
My dad sometimes use me as a translator,btohqsg
I think if i go japan  i can be English tour guide,btohqsg
Just like chinese american kids and their first gen immigrant dads running a chinese restaurant!,btohqsg
Apparently english speaking tour guides are expensive,btohqsg
Yeah but you got to have permission to work there unless its under the table,btohqsg
My dad asked our tour guide why always chinese tour guide  then learnt that english ones are ex,btohqsg
I wanna be a Gude mascot,btohqsg
Though you probably can work on a j find visa if you're from ntu/nus,btohqsg
Lmao? It's called the angmo tax,btohqsg
Funnily enough I just take the Full Japanese tours,btohqsg
Then remain confused as no matter what they say it's not like I will listen to em,btohqsg
NUS/NTU can get Japanese PR in just 1 year,btohqsg
Our mount fuji tour guide charge $700 for 6 of us💀💀,btohqsg
Cos angmo have money. And they gladly pay 30 bucks for lousy ramen at home,btohqsg
There's a japanese show where singaporean tourists paid 100k jpy per pax for a seafood don,btohqsg
The chinese one we paid $70-85,btohqsg
And the japanese tv host was like these sinkies are rich,btohqsg
One factor is coz we do priv tour,btohqsg
Take the tour flag and then wave it around,btohqsg
Nah you get special (bad) treatment if you are prc tourist,btohqsg
But funny thing is one of the tour mostly English speaking so it became an english tour also,btohqsg
And wasted coz that day only 1st level was open due to slip precautions,btohqsg
Bruh u were better off burning your money ablaze instead of that,btohqsg
The japanese are doing just that with the plummeting yen,btohqsg
But omo got other attractions ard mount fuji,btohqsg
20 years ago it was the opposite; japanese tourists living it large in sg,btohqsg
Just that will be good to be at the 5th station one day,btohqsg
U see  japan is never enough for me,btohqsg
Uniqlo and many things are cheaper in japan coz of their currency,btohqsg
But just that the exchange rate to change back to SGD is q sucks,btohqsg
This takes the cake for weirdest checked luggage I've seen this year. Frozen croissants?,btohqsg
In fact  uniqlo pricing is still their old currency of 1SGD - 100¥,btohqsg
How does the croissants even survive?,btohqsg
Tbh i think it wun appreciate back any time soon,btohqsg
Which is why many japanese companies are reporting record profit on overseas sales due to exchange rate gains. They huat cos they report financials in jpy,btohqsg
Precisely  idk. I lol'ed when I saw it coming off the belt,btohqsg
At this rate i prolly will go japan every yr,btohqsg
Don't forget to verify your student status with sq for those economy class discounts,btohqsg
For japan flights can be more than 50% off,btohqsg
Sadly i did not know of such discounts,btohqsg
And sometimes one way is cheaper than round trip if you are on student discount,btohqsg
But i will definitely be back on ANA / SQ soon,btohqsg
At least you are going to be making big bucks at your freshgrad job soon,btohqsg
NUS 8th best university in the world graduate,btohqsg
And my parents recently wanna safe money so hvnt been on sq since 2022 trip,btohqsg
And also coz my fam is big lah,btohqsg
Damn even psc scholar need to save money by foregoing trips?,btohqsg
But good thing is some companies pay for SQ business class,btohqsg
But thing is i dun think i will be in roles w overseas biz trip,btohqsg
If i tell this to my mum  she will be this is the stupidest thing in job consideration🤣,btohqsg
Oh dam SQ seems to be cheaper then jetstar,btohqsg
SQ is often cheaper than budget  depending on the date.,btohqsg
Actually might not be once u have a family,btohqsg
Does sq have limit for carry on?,btohqsg
If you can travel and enjoy good compensation  why not? A lot of roles with travel come with great compensation too.,btohqsg
1*7kg in economy  2*7kg in business/first,btohqsg
Though I haven't been checked since covid... I've gotten away with way more than 7kg in economy.,btohqsg
But no seperate charge for carry on add on like jetstar?,btohqsg
I've also seen pax getting away with oversized cabin baggage the size of a checked bag... and the IFS giving cabin crew a earful for letting the passenger get on board with the bag,btohqsg
Worst thing that can happen is they make you check it... for a fee,btohqsg
the bag literally took up an entire overhead bin,btohqsg
SQ does have baggage allowance for every ticket though  so if you haven't already checked 20kg you probably won't be asked to pay,btohqsg
Also pain in the ass doing banking/adult stuff idk wat im doing💀,btohqsg
The lesson is  budget may not be budget once you add in all the other fees. Which is why I say SQ is often cheaper than budget.,btohqsg
U talking about the airline or yourself?,btohqsg
I prefer scoot  but merely because I trust SIAEC more than I trust other MROs,btohqsg
Oso whr did u comr from tf,btohqsg
So many Virgins  which one? Virgin Atlantic? Virgin Australia?,btohqsg
Whr u see all these post lol,btohqsg
Yall fly passenger for what. Waste time I just FedEx myself to the destination I want. Saves so much money,btohqsg
I trust fellow Singaporeans not to leave a screw loose in the aircraft I fly,btohqsg
U sure it is not just some Bangala worker they subcontractor out to fix your aircraft,btohqsg
They still have to meet CAAS SAR Part 145 regulations. I'm good,btohqsg
Simi lanpa regulations the only SAR we have is the SAR 21,btohqsg
We also have the Singapore Airworthiness Regulations  SAR,btohqsg
"Coincidentally  there is also a SAR Part 21  ""Certification of Products and Articles and of Design and Production Organisations""",btohqsg
No  as long as you are talking about CAAS and not SAF,btohqsg
Some think they can outsmart me.. maybe... maybe I have yet to see one who can outsmart bullet.,btohqsg
with a bullet hole an aircraft will not be airworthy.,btohqsg
Wdym I can just put some duct tape on that,btohqsg
Sure  you can be the pilot and sole occupant of that flight. Good as new!,btohqsg
The entire SAF is held on with duct tape. If it fixes an entire military I see no issue with fixing just 1 small dinky plane,btohqsg
I find your lack of faith in the SAF most concerning. In fact  the SAF is a bunch of conscripts held together by regulars  not duct tape. Hormat SAF!,btohqsg
Oh  and don't forget the Enlistment Act 😂,btohqsg
Definitely is bangla  govt says must be cheaper better faster,btohqsg
I can login now  im straight ballin,btohqsg
Guys  im now officially debt freeeee💯💯💯💯,btohqsg
God damn it  ok for the 10000x i feel like ranting about oldest child problem,btohqsg
But welps i cant turn back the clock to be the youngest,btohqsg
Back then they did not give me any assurance that if i do studies overseas  they will come along,btohqsg
Then now be like ‘if (my bro and sis) go uk  (they) will consider renting an apartment there’,btohqsg
Just becoz both of them are going uni at the same time,btohqsg
Tbh they are not on track of getting a scholarship so hahahaha boo boo to their plane,btohqsg
What if i too am poor dad poor son,btohqsg
Idk talking to my parents about my issues sometimes is the worst decision made coz it makes me feel worst,btohqsg
They need to think what is the cause of me listening to my friends more,btohqsg
Instead of complaining that i listen to my friends more,btohqsg
"Some folks are born made to wave the flagHoo  they're red  white and blueAnd when the band plays ""Hail to the chief""Ooh  they point the cannon at you  LordIt ain't me  it ain't meI ain't no senator's son  sonIt ain't me  it ain't meI ain't no furtunate one  no",btohqsg
Do u get the set or do u just choose ala carte,btohqsg
I like their quail eggs ngl,btohqsg
Idk what are my parents thinking,btohqsg
That im the selfish one that salty they went london during my A lvl prep time,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/ZWijx_AgPiA?si=rtd5t2iOMGcKGmJ415 second sin and you will understand,btohqsg
When they hv big balls to talk abt it in front of me,btohqsg
Omo ofc they dun owe me anything to make them change or whatever  but still💀💀💀,btohqsg
I mean i cannot do anything to change others,btohqsg
Please consult your doctor or local medical professional if you have enlarged testicles,btohqsg
What i can do is to accept their biasness nd favouritism towards my siblings,btohqsg
There's nothing u can do other than laugh,btohqsg
My parents dun care even if they know im not happy,btohqsg
There was once i literally stormed out after the ptc  no way my dad dunno i not happy,btohqsg
It is either they hv 0 eq or they just pretend nth happened,btohqsg
J2 i didnt even bother telling them abt it,btohqsg
Coz my sch ptc aint mandatory unless ur results are bad,btohqsg
So i didnt even pass them the letter lol,btohqsg
Gosh I haven't had a PTC for like 4-5 years now dang I am getting old.,btohqsg
I wish i can halt time,btohqsg
U go to Japan with your family rite?,btohqsg
I mean u still enjoyed your family vacation,btohqsg
Choose a better womb next time😞,btohqsg
Psh what if i dont choose at all,btohqsg
I drew the short end of the stick for every capability measurable,btohqsg
I got given the middle finger and was told that I was not being given a stick because I was an imbecile,btohqsg
eh it's a wee bit insensitive,btohqsg
I mean I am not the one who made the sticker.,btohqsg
I read another book by him,btohqsg
Yea  ultimately it could be easier to simply treat parents like an uncontrollable environmental factor and work on your own life from there.I know that the fact that it's an ongoing problem makes it harder to detach  but you're worth the peace of mind.Previous generations often have shockingly low awareness about emotions  so you're in good company. It may be their responsibility to manage this shortcoming  but it's not entirely their fault.,btohqsg
One problem is my mum never admits wrongdoings,btohqsg
Like sorry is not in her vocabulary,btohqsg
so we all have the same mom then,btohqsg
it's a bad parenting thing lol  my stepdad is your mom,btohqsg
see what counts is that we're all recognising that saying 'sorry' is better than not. That's one pitfall that future children won't have to deal with as much,btohqsg
And I thought moms got heaven in their soles,btohqsg
Never mind I say sorry for her. I am so sorry Musician.,btohqsg
Abit of the cadbury taste osi lol,btohqsg
Anyone wanna sponsor me any rich kids,btohqsg
Its nubbad but for 3.50? And a pretty small bar,btohqsg
this guy teaches you how to play the system in the worst ways possible,btohqsg
out of the uni courses for the 3 main sciences (lifesci/bio  chem  phys) which is the most popular in sg ah,btohqsg
i'd guess chemistry cause have the most job prospects,btohqsg
I think bio and chem have about equal number,btohqsg
Phy dont need to talk  we just a small bunch,btohqsg
tbh when i was younger i was super interested in evolutionary bio (still kinda am) and i was also obsessed with how ancient civilisations came to be,btohqsg
like i just was super interested in how us humans progressed as a species and not just humans but i also had dinosaurs phase,btohqsg
but then ofc sg doesnt rly offer any archaeology courses or bio courses that are more focused on zoology/evolutionary bio (which are the aspects im most interested in),btohqsg
i mean theres nus anthro but tbh im more interested in the sciency side of it like  eg. When did animals first start to walk on land and how did they do so,btohqsg
yeah…bio 714  chem 749  phy 278 throughout 4 ntu batches,btohqsg
physics always has <100 per batch. that's why they can fit us all into the SPMS LTs,btohqsg
im guessing it’s also because some of the people who are good at phy went to engineering,btohqsg
so many engineering fields to choose from too,btohqsg
half the physics cohort is no choice  the other half is wanna do the science itself (or siam engineering),btohqsg
yeah…engineering also has a wider range of career prospects,btohqsg
true tbhcause phy has many engineering fields but bio-related courses in sg aren't that many  like sg doesnt even have zoology or marine bio bachelors.  i mean tbf the demand also v low so can understand why la,btohqsg
i mean you have kuro that's doing bio engineering in poly,btohqsg
physics chem bio math all have,btohqsg
bio related courses in local uni-med-dent-pharm/pharm sci(tbh the latter kinda more chem but eh)-nursing-allied health (SIT)-environmental sci-biological science/life science-bioengineering,btohqsg
out of those 5 are healthcare related 😬,btohqsg
i mean bioengineering also kind of health related,btohqsg
@aforacegot a future pharm student maybe here,btohqsg
im not touching any of the healthcare related courses,btohqsg
As a SOH person I am laughing,btohqsg
WAIT I SEE SPMS TEXTS IN HERE,btohqsg
Actually the bio cohort I think is much larger from what I see compared to chem.,btohqsg
most job prospects out of the 3 ig,btohqsg
At least yall have triple digit intakes,btohqsg
We need to purge some people here man,btohqsg
(Starting with me because im wasting resources),btohqsg
Mines already purged Philosophy has legit no one,btohqsg
My majors faculty doesn't even have a full prof.,btohqsg
Don't think so lowly of yourself,btohqsg
You've made a lot of progress,btohqsg
I didn't so.. I am gonna purge myself,btohqsg
chem and bio are close in intake but more people take chem in jc than the others so there’s that too,btohqsg
physics and math faculty in ntu (used to include chem). the LTs there are smaller so larger cohorts need to use other venues,btohqsg
Isit the size of a Hive Seminar room? Or like an LT Hive size?,btohqsg
Actly why is bukit timah all the rich ppl,btohqsg
Rich people like to be around rich people. Virtuous cycles of property value,btohqsg
because the houses there are expensive,btohqsg
i want to live in bukit timah or marine parade when im older,btohqsg
Gd that uk what u want  coz im a bad example that basically chose my uni degree base on my A levels RP,btohqsg
Tbh I believe im not the only one  but seriously it is not the way to go but back then i was like ‘i studied hard for sth’,btohqsg
idk man i dont even plan to aim too high,btohqsg
same i chose my uni degree because of my RP... but not in the way you'd think HAHHA,btohqsg
i hope i can stay fine for the next few sem because i heard it gets steeper,btohqsg
Jiayous  hopefully u will find ur passion,btohqsg
my senior just warned me y3s1 is gonna kill me harder than y1 and y2 did and im not looking forward lmao,btohqsg
i think it'll just make me hate the thing long term,btohqsg
just something i am reasonably good at and dont hate,btohqsg
I wasnt looking fwd to any of my sems except for the internships coz somehow working / learning hands-on is more fun,btohqsg
Learning drugs on paper is crazy boring,btohqsg
Possibly the hardest bah... 4 physics core mods,btohqsg
oh wait you're taking EM the coming sem too?,btohqsg
ok yea your mods need to buckle down to nail,btohqsg
can't speak for the tech applications mod bc it didn't exist for me,btohqsg
Apparently my senior was the first batch for it and they said it wasnt done very well,btohqsg
But then it was under elbert chia  and now its a new prof taking over so we still dont know what to expect now either,btohqsg
But it is what it is  still gotta get it done,btohqsg
welp. content wise seems to be a combination of mods you've done before tho so there's that,btohqsg
My y4s2 was the craziest sem,btohqsg
I dun really hv a passion that can be turned into a job🤣 but it is more of knowing what u want to do for the next 35-40y,btohqsg
I choose it based on my grades obtained at Alevels,btohqsg
Meanwhile i woke up w terrible post-trip depression again,btohqsg
Ok at this rate it is not again but practically everyday since i come back💀,btohqsg
Took it out of my words,btohqsg
I woke up with terrible I don't wanna work syndrome,btohqsg
But NTU CAO says need so here I am,btohqsg
NTU CAO says many useless things,btohqsg
Their incompetence is actually hilarious if u ever try to call em u will know they don't reply one,btohqsg
Depends on the relationship. My admin for my majors undergrad remembers my number so she picks up,btohqsg
FK THE WALK FROM NORTH SPINE TO SOUTH SPINE,btohqsg
See I have never gotten lost at NUS,btohqsg
you go nus a lot more,btohqsg
Ah so u are the ones that block the fucking way when I rushing for classes from SS to NS,btohqsg
No im not even from ntu,btohqsg
I was there for an event in March,btohqsg
The walk from south to north spine in heels is toxic,btohqsg
Tbf walking anywhere with heels sounds toxic,btohqsg
Yes that's the point. Half the walkway is choked up with tourist who don't know where they going meanwhile I just wanna go to my classes,btohqsg
it was extremely bad at ntu,btohqsg
Like the fact your whole body weight rest on two single pointed pillar and then your feet have to bend like 45 degrees everytime,btohqsg
I once took the mrt and saw this girl wearing the tallest heel I've ever seen..made her look like a giant among the crowd  luckily she manage to step clear of the train gap,btohqsg
Experience: 10/10 will do it again?,btohqsg
U took the route that went thru the carpark and nanyang auditorium rite?,btohqsg
Then take the lift up or Smth,btohqsg
The hard route is thru University Counselling Centre and then cut thru,btohqsg
