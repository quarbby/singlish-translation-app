Recently on the shuttle bus some guy randomly be like ‘can i ask u sth’And then ask me am i in a bachelor degree here,btohqsg
Then went on to ask me what is my course…and claim his cousin deciding between ntu n nus and how i find the degree here,btohqsg

I mean... Sentosa Cove is also pretty ulu ngl,btohqsg
So can somewhat understand the unprofitablility,btohqsg
If you want to stay in beach and enjoy the beach  might as well buy a property at Bali,btohqsg
Some more can remote work from there,btohqsg
Which is the trend I see these days,btohqsg
Not only cheaper  more things to do there as well,btohqsg
With the money able to buy a property at Sentosa Cove  you can probably get a long term visa at Bali as well,btohqsg
Back before covid  remote working is not really common,btohqsg
"I thought he said ""This thing""",btohqsg
Remote working only gets popular once covid strikes,btohqsg
Then you have like one year of not able to travel freely,btohqsg
So that also probably explains why investing in Sentosa Cove is not that good as well,btohqsg
