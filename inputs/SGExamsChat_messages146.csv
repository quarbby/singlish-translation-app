Lawyer doctors also have to go thru long tough years before seeing high pay but their pay growth is exponential compared to other profession,btohqsg
In fact lawyer doctor their early years incur opporttnity loss too so when they make back later on it balances out,btohqsg
For status and credential.. a lot,btohqsg
Ya not always hahaSometimes the dryness (of school routine) kills the interest,btohqsg
To me its about status and intellectual development,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt need to respond to every single message,btohqsg
Yes ok i only respond to those i am interested,btohqsg
Yes i am interested in certain things they mention üòÖ,btohqsg
Cos other ppl r not present now so it looks like i am the only one spamming,btohqsg
But they'll reply when they see it,btohqsg
It's deeper than that you will know a lot more. Like USA is actually unreasonable compared to the USSR,btohqsg
Uh ok thks  too deep üôÉ,btohqsg
But the analysis shd help us make more discoveries,btohqsg
Okay la I‚Äôd would like to take a degree because I would also like to learn more instead of starting work so early also :(,btohqsg
And the job I want to apply to requires that sooo,btohqsg
All the best! Have u found a way to gain higher chance to gain entrance?,btohqsg
If not I would alrd be enrolled. I got offered frm nafa and lasalle haha but rejected cause I didn‚Äôt just want a degree for the sake of it,btohqsg
Made my parents super unhappy tho,btohqsg
Uh  ok! Haha design is v cool but nvm,btohqsg
Might call admissions aft work and see how,btohqsg
Is cool la but the worth for the degree jus isn‚Äôt there for me,btohqsg
Ya i underdtand their thinking üòÖ i understand ur change of interest too üòÇ,btohqsg
I can be a YouTube or wtv without a degree what,btohqsg
True cos health science is more practical for society today,btohqsg
I mean in a sense of that being a career la,btohqsg
And I feel like my life has more value being in the health sciences too,btohqsg
Hopefully sit would accept me tho üò´,btohqsg
If not I might consider taking a lvls,btohqsg
Call admin n if nice  share with us what they say. Or is it more effective to call/email the course director or programme manager of ur desired course directly?,btohqsg
Not sure. Cause idh background in math or sci,btohqsg
It is ok too  but need to prepare time n money,btohqsg
Oh... then what r u strong in? Humanities?,btohqsg
I was thinking what is the relevance? He doesn't say 'there's a video...' I thought he was comparing me to one of them,btohqsg
Got a for geog la! But I didn‚Äôt do math n sci in poly so abit worried to do a,btohqsg
Cause id be starting frm scratch,btohqsg
hi. anyone took business law? i‚Äôm currently dying i wonder if it‚Äôs normal?:///,btohqsg
isnt it normal to die in law,btohqsg
idk everyone seems to be doing fine,btohqsg
oo which profession are you looking at?,btohqsg
R u the ta for is110,btohqsg
I wanted to complement on ur voice,btohqsg
Yes will be bit tough :(Oh but u got o level maths right? Have Amaths? O level maths is enuff to do h1 maths for a levels,btohqsg
it'll be better if i can go uni tho,btohqsg
OoüòÇ you're that rare one who actually enjoy army,btohqsg
you don't need Amath to do H1 math,btohqsg
Some ppl just cant digest law cos it is dry subject. Which aspect u struggling.. the understanding or remembering or the application to questions?,btohqsg
It takes awhile to adjust too,btohqsg
like applying the law rules to the case study?,btohqsg
So how r they doing it?,btohqsg
In fact you don't need Amath to do H2 math,btohqsg
U just need a good tutor like John Smith,btohqsg
if u have a math background ur pure math ez game,btohqsg
Oh wow thats the more interesting part no? U wanna pm me?,btohqsg
What other humans u strong in?? And r u good in english?,btohqsg
But I didn‚Äôt have the chance of doing pure for o,btohqsg
Yea but have a diploma in designü§°,btohqsg
it is interesting but like everytime when i tot it‚Äôs like this certain rule applies end up it‚Äôs another then i‚Äôm like ._.???? hahah,btohqsg
Haha check out on them!! And also try asking them. If u dun wish to be so direct or obvious in seeking help  then test water  like ask ‚Äúhow u know is like that‚Äù,btohqsg
how u want do a‚Äôs sia,btohqsg
I was top scorer if that helps,btohqsg
Yea I guess? Cause idk how else to apply for degree,btohqsg
The work experience thing rlly v pure luck one,btohqsg
Did u rig a bot to send this again,btohqsg
I‚Äôm trying to apply radiography for sit. B my diploma not relevant. Don‚Äôt rlly wna do design or media,btohqsg
Can do history? Then for that matter u can take arts subjects alr üòÇ with a h1 maths,btohqsg
but she wants to go into health sciences no?,btohqsg
Which aspect of it? Or what function u seeking,btohqsg
tbh I'd recommend taking H2 biology,btohqsg
Still deciding but not sure if I should rlly jus chiong a cause doesn‚Äôt seem easy. Ltr fail thn die,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like x ray and stuff.,btohqsg
Ppl help u position u body to do the xray those ppl,btohqsg
HUH. Hmm. did u manage to identify why the discrepency? Discrepancy in perspective haha. There is surely a pattern,btohqsg
i got one girl ik she took a diploma in biomed or smth then went on a degree in psychology,btohqsg
even tho its completely diff fields,btohqsg
But at least she got science :/,btohqsg
i cant remember if its biomed or what,btohqsg
Like Ik ppl frm engineering and it got into radiology too. But they all have science math background,btohqsg
i js remember it was a damn drastic change,btohqsg
Yea check if a level got offer f&n  my jc didnt provide thou,btohqsg
b it she went for interview and still made it in,btohqsg
a level offer f&n u want do what sia,btohqsg
I will apply luh. But abit scared if cannt go in thn waste another year,btohqsg
Yes go for private if u can stay focused to self study esp if u taking humanities  u can read up on ur own. Bc gg to sch can be draining too.,btohqsg
That was what I was thinking,btohqsg
Hehehe. Act humble n test water üòÇ,btohqsg
Just to get good grades n gain entrance first,btohqsg
Yes read up the exam answering techniques n requirements. Surely theres a cheat sheet somewhere,btohqsg
Wa rlly regret didn‚Äôt take a lvl tbh,btohqsg
Degree in psychology from which uni?,btohqsg
Hahaha so for the times that cannot  why? How r they different from the times that can. There is sth consistent soemwhere there,btohqsg
Eek  about the brain? Just a small part of psychology only right?,btohqsg
What if u apply with ur current diploma but take some maths/science SATS test or just take some maths/science paper? I think u really can have a chat with the programme manager. It is not as bad as u think right now,btohqsg
I did try to apply for foundations diploma frm mdis,btohqsg
Which had a basics math stuff,btohqsg
Haha at least complete the a level cert first ma  can passport her to the uni course she want,btohqsg
But it got cancelled last min cause not enuf ppl,btohqsg
So I‚Äôm like kind panicking rn,btohqsg
No lah. Not wasted at all. Too soon to regret,btohqsg
How about the remaining private schools? They go offer? Still u contact programme manager first. Dun jump jump the gun  in case manager says dun even need u to do those extra papers,btohqsg
Yes ‚ò∫Ô∏è actually i mdis design sch. I like mdis actually. It‚Äôs really a good environment,btohqsg
didn‚Äôt apply the other sch cause couldn‚Äôt afford at that time. Rn the application closed and too late alrd. But I might apply next year if I don‚Äôt get into sit,btohqsg
Tbh I don‚Äôt rlly understand I mean students can go nafa/ lasalle if they want go art sch,btohqsg
But mdis is a good prg la,btohqsg
Is there any short course math sci related that can be done,btohqsg
Sometimes its bc nafa/laselle too expensive or too difficult to get in. And also their curricular system is different from mdis. Mdis more relaxed n flexible (more like adult uni)  less stressful/strict too,btohqsg
Degree in diagnostic radiography is it the one u looking at?,btohqsg
What kind of design u studied in diploma?,btohqsg
Haha looks like don need to do a full alevels,btohqsg
Yup take specific papers will do (should be)üòÄ,btohqsg
Everyt I did web design magazine deign + videography and photography,btohqsg
Not the same as the digital design. RP media production and design,btohqsg
So technically I can just take bio and math a lvl?,btohqsg
The text in the pic says you need GP and MT as well,btohqsg
Dunno how it works for private candidate admissions  but most people take 3H2 1H1 with GP and MT  so you might want to email SIT to confirm if you need to do this too,btohqsg
What about PW? I know private candidates don't take it but I'm not sure if it would negatively affect the application,btohqsg
I jus got off the phone frm sit la they stated as long as it‚Äôs a general hospital setting in terms of experience,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt ask bout a lvls,btohqsg
The uni can‚Äôt reasonably ask you to take PW  and u don‚Äôt really have a way to do it without a JC anyway,btohqsg
I‚Äôm trying to avoid a lvls if possible bc it‚Äôs so content heavyüò≠,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt be able to take h2 bc my o lvls subjects were combine and not strong enuf. I looked into MI as well but doesn‚Äôt seem like that‚Äôs an option,btohqsg
But will email n cfm again!!,btohqsg
If ur combined science was good  like A1 good  H2 is not out of reach,btohqsg
It was kind of a c6,btohqsg
But of course if so idm taking h1 and h2,btohqsg
Thanks for all the advices guys ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫,btohqsg
She‚Äôs trying to get a science course that requires 2H2 sciences,btohqsg
I guess hybrid is always an option though,btohqsg
Oh okay  I was confused since she mentioned the arts schools,btohqsg
Oh I was from an arts course :),btohqsg
But decided not to go forth with the path,btohqsg
I just saw the further Mathematics syllabus  they said they removed something this year  turns out they removed so little  hahaha,btohqsg
The last time I saw the further Mathematics syllabus  they said private candidates were not allowed to take it. Now they apparently can  but they have to register for H2 Mathematics first,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the most annoying thing in the syllabus,btohqsg
And I think it is only for this year. Next year  probably back to normal,btohqsg
U have to manually type in a bunch of stuff into a calculator and look up the wilcoxon table in MF26,btohqsg
Okay I guess Chi squared is more annoying in that sense,btohqsg
Yes! But double confirm with programme manager,btohqsg
Has anyone actually used the Wilcoxon test,btohqsg
Wow look  another b0t  posting while everyone is on,btohqsg
Well  I don't really know how to use the graphing calculator and I often just look up the formulae sheet. My mathematics and physics teachers complained that I don't know how to use it.I guess I was too reliant on my mental computations. Many teachers were concerned that the accuracy was compromised,btohqsg
@Flowers0103u still have a bit of foundation there  not that bad lei,btohqsg
How does x > y vs y > x help you,btohqsg
I can't imagine 1 day you walk into a business meeting,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt take any of this,btohqsg
To be honest  I can't remember what is the wilcoxon sign test,btohqsg
"And you say ""we did wilcoxon test so we know that product y has specification z greater than that of product a""But we don't know by how much",btohqsg
@Flowers0103i looked thru the modules  most HSC and DRGOkay lah  u r not too far off from what they need. Just top up with h2 bio and maths is really Good enuff,btohqsg
Ohh what did u take?? Why didnt take these?,btohqsg
Haha then do top up in coding üòÇOh ya suss offers biomedical engineering too u keen in that?,btohqsg
I did my intern overseas too,btohqsg
Not so much in engineering but open to the idea as of now,btohqsg
More so in radio bc I know what‚Äôs gg on la,btohqsg
üòÇ thats for students who enter with pure a level cert?,btohqsg
Wow thats v heavy lei but she has 3-yr diploma alr,btohqsg
It‚Äôs in the picture u sent,btohqsg
Anyone know where to but resistance bands,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a shop in novena and mayb online,btohqsg
But she alr have a 3-yr dip oh. Not pure alevels cert,btohqsg
Not sure if people know about Higher School Certificate (HSC)  the predecessor to A levels and School Certificate (SC)  the predecessor to O levels,btohqsg
U can try decathalon but dk if have,btohqsg
Haha carousell so that the person can pass to u asap,btohqsg
Used to be pure mathematics+ statistics+mechanics in core and f maths,btohqsg
Another thing I find odd about A and O levels in the omission of the composition symbol in composite functions. f\circ g compared to fg,btohqsg
Functions r kind of handwaved in the O and A syllabus,btohqsg
But i guess it is quite demanding to ask students to go rigorously into the definition of functions and its properties,btohqsg
Well  at university  they essentially taught it in 15-20 minutes? Basically  they taught the definition  injectivity  surjectivity and bijectivity and how to prove them. Then they went onto proving left inverse is equivalent to injectivity. Right inverse is equivalent to surjectivity by Zorn's Lemma  which is equivalent to the axiom of choice so they didn't prove it at the time (too complex). So we conclude from there that a function has an inverse iff it is bijective.,btohqsg
Which is awful  because they are so important. I know the definition is not that intuitive but when you compare it to the epsilon-delta definition  hahaha  it's no match,btohqsg
I only know pre-image is open/s,btohqsg
Do you mean definition of a limit or definition of continuity using a limit,btohqsg
Continuity is easier to understand from the definition of a limit  but epsilon-delta isn't intuitive at all,btohqsg
I'm not an analysis person anyways,btohqsg
If you ask math profs I think they will use the Topological definition of continuity instead.There's a trend for pure math stuff to not work in reals if not required to,btohqsg
Cuz it's where they need the eps-delta typically?,btohqsg
Unless you want to talk about a sequence of sets (with some containment requirements) instead  which is worse,btohqsg
I don't know. Not my interest,btohqsg
I'm doing logic now. Quite complicated. This is only the basics...,btohqsg
Not really. Essentially they came in and introduced something like this table  which makes sense. Then they introduced soundness  disjunctive normal form  conjunctive normal form etc. That's when it starts to get confusing.Now they are way past that... Sometimes I don't even know what is going on,btohqsg
Next part was partially on this,btohqsg
They also went through the MU puzzle,btohqsg
Even proving 1+1=2 isn't that easy  because you need to define addition.,btohqsg
Jeez it was a joke but I appreciate the breakdown,btohqsg
why is there no option for straight,btohqsg
This? Never seen this but I did learn satisfiability,btohqsg
Anyway  with the rise of CS  expect to hear about 3-SAT in general,btohqsg
There's no rise in interest of logic,btohqsg
But there is a rise general CS interest,btohqsg
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S8Rnr3bAG3APhase 2 will likely last 'months',btohqsg
Baby boomers are those born after WWII,btohqsg
Really? there's no need to say that,btohqsg
Oh hahaha ok i mixed up,btohqsg
I want to be boomer  hahaha,btohqsg
My father was born in the colony of Singapore,btohqsg
Do u feel so - the betas in movies are always outshining the main,btohqsg
How is this gen even strawberry,btohqsg
They say strawberries r easily smashed,btohqsg
Because I guess it was my upbringing that impacted me the most. The time where you don't have people looking at their phones (except maybe tamagotchi)  people playing pokemon cards and not pokemon go etc. I don't play these but yeah.I regret I'm not old enough. I listen to 70s/80s music because my parents are older and they influenced me. So I'm a bit awkward being born in the 90s,btohqsg
Cannot apply even slightest pressure on them,btohqsg
Oh. Yes ba  boomers actually go thru a period of time where things change rapidly,btohqsg
All my friends are born in the 90s. I hardly ever mix with people born in the 2000s  except maybe now,btohqsg
I grew up running around my childhood no phones little tv just out there running,btohqsg
I cU sound like boomer tooI tot u were one,btohqsg
When I was in Singapore I used to go to Specialist's shopping centre (now demolished  became orchard gateway) and watch tom and jerry at the food court,btohqsg
my cousin got a tablet at 2 or 3,btohqsg
everyday wake up at 4am watch the polar bear cartoom,btohqsg
Kids today may be handicapped in certain areas due to these ipads,btohqsg
Oh wow! But u all so young,btohqsg
He's the most active kid I have ever seen,btohqsg
It's horrible these days. Parents are expected to entertain their child with tablets to keep them quiet,btohqsg
I'm older than most of them though,btohqsg
Huh my relatives keep their kid quiet by letting them exercise and run like mad until they get tired,btohqsg
This is how my cousins sleep 5 times a day as a kid,btohqsg
Yes  when i was young on the aeroplanes it was babies crying constantly. Now  silence,btohqsg
Eh smart hahahaActually some boys sch alsoMake their students join many CCAs and exhaust them w sch activities,btohqsg
So that they hv no more energy to,btohqsg
When I was young  we were taught how to use a computer. It was a new thing  so how to log on  how to open word  what is double click  right click,btohqsg
Go steady and etc after sch,btohqsg
Now  why do children need to be taught these?,btohqsg
When I was young it was mostly cassettes. CDs only starting to take off,btohqsg
But they will need to learn new things,btohqsg
I only learnt how to use a computer at p1 because my parents don't want let me us,btohqsg
Whichever age n generation we come to we need to keep learning new things,btohqsg
I know how to record with a cassette too,btohqsg
Kids prolly will learn how to operate n automate AI machines,btohqsg
I learning a bit in my cca,btohqsg
I can click with the 80s generation way better than the 2000s for whatever reason. More similar traits I guess,btohqsg
Omg.. but u actually so young only,btohqsg
Ya ure uniqueMaybe growing up in china did make a diff,btohqsg
Yeah  but I even brought a cassette to JC because I thought that was the way to record things...,btohqsg
Because china was much more backwards when I was young,btohqsg
So u need cassette player too,btohqsg
I learnt how to fix a door and smash open one on my own lol,btohqsg
China was how many years behind sg?,btohqsg
Handheld  could hold in one hand,btohqsg
They only got rich after 2000,btohqsg
In 2001 when I first went there more like 1980s singapore,btohqsg
I was told by my dad that msia is 20 years behind sg hence when u converse with msians  there will be a gap,btohqsg
Ok now i wonder whcih countries r ahead of sg,btohqsg
Don't look at GDP. Look at the everyday life of people. Because income inequality in the past was much larger,btohqsg
Oh ya so they suddenly developed very rapidly  right?,btohqsg
Yes because 2000 was when they joined WTO,btohqsg
Yes i agree thou. Not tough la but just mafan haha,btohqsg
Yes yes look at their culture n way of thinking,btohqsg
Oh sry i mean how many yrs r they ahead of us üòÇ,btohqsg
Ya üòÇ he referring to now  i referring to then. Actually i din specify,btohqsg
Should be quite close to SG standard,btohqsg
Their data their taxes their crimes,btohqsg
Oh yeah my friends there said this as well,btohqsg
Oh northern europe i found itNo wonder finland sweden denmark.. their education system so,btohqsg
Wow close. Then sg is quite on top of the game,btohqsg
No that's the Florida of Canada,btohqsg
Someone living there told me she saw a guy wearing a unicorn floatie running down the street at 6am,btohqsg
Sounds pretty lit(and a good reason to go to Canada),btohqsg
plus florida covid hotspot some new station swabbed areas and 20% of it had covid virus strains on it,btohqsg
USA q smart to dump China for India lol,btohqsg
I need to dig out the developed photographs because most of my photographs when I was young was on film.,btohqsg
Only in florida the best place in the entire world,btohqsg
the place where you will actually see pigs fly for the first time,btohqsg
Omg why or how is it like. Is it very developed?,btohqsg
I like to visit developed countries,btohqsg
I wanna go shanghai one day,btohqsg
I have entered china 72 times. While living and visiting there,btohqsg
USA is really not that great from what my teacher said,btohqsg
Depends on your definition of great,btohqsg
the illusion that USA is beautiful and the greatest will disappear when you go in there lor,btohqsg
You wld think mama mia amazing stuff,btohqsg
I want go China one day,btohqsg
Wad. If ure 20 years old  u enter china averagely 3 times per year,btohqsg
Go to the I forgot the name of that sexy ass river,btohqsg
Where did I say I'm 20?,btohqsg
My teacher say usa is a crazy country lolAnd now looking from the news  like messy cos of DT?,btohqsg
I only wanna visit LA cos hollywood is there and my impression of their nightscene is beautiful üòÇ,btohqsg
I stumbled upon it randomly while exploring google maps of china and the gorges dam,btohqsg
wanted to see the dam collapse ngl,btohqsg
I dun care about the dam üòÇ,btohqsg
There isn't much to do there actually,btohqsg
Icic but i wanna see the environment n the feel,btohqsg
I dun do much either üòÇjust eat sleep n chill,btohqsg
Well  I only started entering China in October 2001 and I'm not 20,btohqsg
Idk I just heard somewhere that there are more clubs and the sort there,btohqsg
Thanks alot i will chk out chengdu,btohqsg
Oh i saw sth on fb awhile ago,btohqsg
I love Sichuanese food. Have you heard of Ê∞¥ÁÖÆÁâõËÇâÔºü,btohqsg
Their music n techno inside the clubvery advanced,btohqsg
They were playing the mix of alan walker faded with some chinese songs,btohqsg
Omg my faveI forgotten if i heard but basically all their beef n spicy food v nice haha,btohqsg
I see if i can find back the linkIt is too futuristic n totally cool,btohqsg
And watermelon juice in summer! Must try in Sichuan!,btohqsg
Haha hot weather drink watermelon juice. Can.,btohqsg
Wait till u try US applications lmao,btohqsg
How? Just take A levels  get your A levels certificate  anyhow fill up the form and boom. Accept.,btohqsg
The amt of essays u need to write is much more,btohqsg
UK is just 1 PS only,btohqsg
I know  so I avoid them. And I hate their extra cirricular nonsense,btohqsg
Sorry  I know it sounds easy for me  I know some people struggle but yeah,btohqsg
Yeah that's why I am probably not trying US,btohqsg
U left out a line*Min 70RP required,btohqsg
Yes ure super correct! That was DNA Club in chengdu,btohqsg
Their instagram does not show much but heres the linkhttps://instagram.com/dna.club520?igshid=1jtioar60ikzh,btohqsg
I don't even know my points. Whatever. Faculty of science -- mathematics is so easy to get iut,btohqsg
If IVY leagues gave fair chances regardless of nationality singapore would still have little ivy league graduates lol,btohqsg
I think it went upBut I don't want to say too much otherwise people that waited months will get angry with me,btohqsg
US apps are much more unpredictable,btohqsg
do sg students have anything other than grades?,btohqsg
some of the admits run like 3 clubs 1 non profit and so much,btohqsg
the ones in usa open a whole ass non profit we can't fight,btohqsg
unless sg stop focusing so mch on grades then we got chance,btohqsg
but now meh don't see it happening anytime soon,btohqsg
I mean I would think that I have a lot more to offer than just grades,btohqsg
If there arent limits placed on international students %acceptance rate will definitely soar,btohqsg
But in terms of excelling at everyt no,btohqsg
But I do enjoy a good amount of things,btohqsg
Cost is a barrier for many as well,btohqsg
I think for those in the international schools here  they're the only ones without financial problems,btohqsg
yes im saying if no limits no cost,btohqsg
"Usa will still edge out because their curriculum is a bit more ""free"".",btohqsg
You'd be surprise at how some value NS experience for guys,btohqsg
At both admissions into unis and also employment overseas,btohqsg
And I don't mean with regards to Pes status,btohqsg
Just some overseas universities or company find it intriguing and its a point of consideration,btohqsg
Just because u find NS redundant doesnt mean all do hahahaha,btohqsg
Most do dont dare say only,btohqsg
Just because it's norm in SG doesn't mean it is for other people elsewhere haha,btohqsg
If you are talking about dinner today  no. Why?,btohqsg
Okay... Thank you.Have you eaten dinner tonight?,btohqsg
Prof. I need help for a legal case. Can you help?,btohqsg
What did professor do to you?,btohqsg
I am saying the conversation was awkward,btohqsg
I think you mean what they call ÂêÉÁìú in China,btohqsg
is it a slang or something,btohqsg
Means you are just an onlooker. It's internet slang,btohqsg
€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€ü€üA–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π–ú–µ–∫—Ö–∞–Ω—Ç—ã–µ–≤€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™€™‚ò≠'Besides  algebra takes away the intuition and replaces it with a robotic method'Algebra is based on axioms and theorems and definitions. It is not robotic. Regarding the model method  I don't know what the axioms are... Relying solely on intuition is not mathematics.,btohqsg
Please don't confuse mathematics with mathematical education,btohqsg
A degree in mathematics is not a replacement for a post graduate diploma in education,btohqsg
In school  the manipulation of algebraic equations is v formulaic,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a fixed way to do everything  it‚Äôs like following an algorithm,btohqsg
That‚Äôs wad he means by robotic  probably,btohqsg
I mean in the context of P6  all worded questions are actually 2-variable linear equations,btohqsg
Using algebra makes it very monotonous,btohqsg
'Mathematics' taught just by intuition is not mathematics.And I'm not saying it's the teacher's fault. They have to follow the syllabus.I am not confused by the difference between mathematics and mathematics education. But I don't believe any of my lecturers have a postgraduate diploma in education.I know primary school is different  but this means that people who are more suited to mathematics presented rigourously do not do so well in mathematics at school. This would mean people that could potentially be future mathematicians are disincentivised to pursue mathematics  as they may have an incorrect perception of it.,btohqsg
Well  the question in itself is not interesting in the first place. It does not allow for more interesting manipulations,btohqsg
But at least there is more thinking going on when students use models,btohqsg
Definitely not purely intuition  but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll agree that concepts should be motivated by an intuitive idea before you set down the rigorous definitions and lemmas,btohqsg
Anyway what else do you expect P6 students to do? Quadratic maybe?,btohqsg
I think it depends. For example  if you want to teach the notion of a limit and differentiation at a particular point  then introduce the intuitive notion and then show how the formal definition is developed.But on the other hand  if you want to teach linear algebra or abstract algebra  I believe the formal definitions should usually come first. Using the formal definitions  we can see what is going on intuitively.This also applies to elementary algebra. Fine if you don't want to teach peano arithmetic  but you can teach them rules such as ‚â§ is a partial order and a‚â§b iffa+c‚â§b+c etc. From there you can teach them the intuitive concept of it. Then it becomes more structured.,btohqsg
Yeah  but from what I understand teachers in Singapore tend to be quite picky on the way the model is presented. Which defeats the purpose of the model as it is to help you. And it is not the teachers fault because the syllabus requires it.If you want to prove using the model  why not introduce algebra first  and then introduce the model? At least we have a concrete basis,btohqsg
If they are intellegent enough  why not proceed to linear algebra or group theory? Or teach them axiomatic set theory? Or teach them real analysis?,btohqsg
Well some algebra is taught in P6,btohqsg
Sure  for the minority that is of this capability  it is fine to go there,btohqsg
Yes  but not before the model was introduced,btohqsg
Not everyone is as smart as you,btohqsg
Besides  H3 Math already offers a taste of pure math,btohqsg
the main reason why they dont wanna proceed to that is bc its abit too complex alr tbh,btohqsg
Unlike H2 math which is mainly computation by plugging numbers into GCs,btohqsg
ur stuffing them with those stuff they wld be confused,btohqsg
I regret not being able to learn what i am learning now earlier. I never had the opportunity. That's the issue. If someone had introduced all these more advanced topics in an abstract way  I would have done so much more by now.Some people learn university stuff at age 9. I doubt I can do that but maybe some time later,btohqsg
And how many % of the population can do that?,btohqsg
I'm not clever. I feel stupid usually. I can't do a lot of things.,btohqsg
My meaning is that it is very very rare for a kid to be at this level,btohqsg
And in SG  we have avenues for such talents to prosper,btohqsg
We have the gifted ed programme  and we also have NUS high for science and maths,btohqsg
H3 is too late. JC2 is too late. And in Singapore you cannot skip years.I saw the MOE H3 mathematics and was unimpressed by it. I looked at the definition of continuity and laughed.,btohqsg
ü§îCan literally say the same for every other subject  and detractors who are weak in the aforementioned subjects will protest in disdain.,btohqsg
In NUSH  the kids complete J2 stuff by Y4  and do uni level for Y5 and 6,btohqsg
I understand  but the syllabus is currently filled with things I can't do. You can remove them and put this in,btohqsg
Many of the science international Olympiad teams take in kids from nush as well  and the usual RI HC ACS,btohqsg
"Although I have felt the same way as you in that ""there was no opportunity for me at a younger age""  you must understand that the education system is designed for majority of students",btohqsg
GEP is not a good. How are people selected? And what if they are not a all rounder. Most geniuses are not all rounders. And I'm not even sure if they teach mathematics rigourously in there,btohqsg
you do have to teach them the basics before u throw in something complicated which is linked to those basics,btohqsg
For international science olympiads  RI and NUSH form a duopoly,btohqsg
The rest of the JCs have <20% combined market share,btohqsg
not giving these complicated ideas without allowing them to get a grasp of the basics will make fhem confused,btohqsg
What if people fall through the cracks and don't end up in NUSH? The admissions process doesn't catch everyone,btohqsg
But at the expense of Singapore winning a nobel prize or the fields medal? We can have a accelerated stream on top of the express stream,btohqsg
It‚Äôs impossible to make sure people don‚Äôt fall through the cracks  but NUSH has two intake periods  so it‚Äôs less likely that a genius won‚Äôt be noticed,btohqsg
One in Sec 1  one in Sec 3,btohqsg
Mathematics Olympiad is not even really rigourous mathematics. Why bother? Don't know about the natural sciences though,btohqsg
We kind of already have that,btohqsg
Sad isn't it? If we have this perhaps Singapore gets a number of nobel prizes and fields medals,btohqsg
Maybe  but that was just an example,btohqsg
I think the education system is alr decent enough,btohqsg
I dont think an education system is defined to be a success based on the number of nobel prizes and medal winners,btohqsg
We do catch legit geniuses and they do end up in institutions that can cultivate their abilities,btohqsg
Yeah I think it would be nice if the system were more flexible,btohqsg
That's why I created more opportunities for myself as I grew older,btohqsg
Ask urself what are actually some other contributing reasons why singapore hardly produces such ppl?,btohqsg
Well  I know there is no perfect system  but we need to actively look for geniuses everywhere. Not wait for them to apply,btohqsg
Is not just the education system,btohqsg
To be crude  NS is another reason why,btohqsg
i.e. they go to places like Cambridge,btohqsg
The 2 yrs can make a huge difference,btohqsg
But for example fields medal has an age limit of 40. So you need to get mathematicians trained quickly and have them more time to come up with something that wins them the fields medal,btohqsg
cuz singapore's education is programmed to produce high skilled workers that work for rich employers,btohqsg
But at the end of the day  is a duty to serve the nation anyways,btohqsg
But I believe everyone in p3 is compelled to go for the GEP screening test,btohqsg
*Proceeds to increase intake of more computing students*,btohqsg
And the gep test is primarily logic,btohqsg
the purpose of educating others is so they can work for the rich  if everyone were to have their talents developed and could make big money and win awards no one wld be working for others and the equilibrium of the whole society wld be flipped,btohqsg
Not necessarily. Some just don't want to and there are so many factors. And if they go to Cambridge  aren't you scared Singapore doesn't retain them  i.e. they remain overseas or even become a foreign national?,btohqsg
The last thing you want is a brain drain in Singapore,btohqsg
It has been happening for the longest of time lol,btohqsg
singapore just isnt that attractive for ppl to call hone,btohqsg
Our education system produce employees  not employers,btohqsg
Singapore doesn‚Äôt have the culture to take these people to their limit,btohqsg
But it would certainly be interesting if we did,btohqsg
Im alr intellectually stimulated by so much stuff irl alr,btohqsg
His rank got (NS) beside it,btohqsg
and singapore market is really small too,btohqsg
unless u r working in financial sector or else most ppl choose to go overseas,btohqsg
I guess so. But why not change it? It's not like you should say  whatever  it doesn't matter if they leave,btohqsg
So many CECA with inferior qualifications competing for jobs,btohqsg
not that people dont wanna change it but our govt is unwilling to do so,btohqsg
Ironic rightLocal talents leave us  and talents from other parts of the world flock to sg,btohqsg
Even I plan to move overseas if future economic conditions are good there,btohqsg
We kind of do  through prestigious bonded scholarships like PSC that allow them to go overseas to a really good uni  but have them come back to work in SG,btohqsg
dun rly wanna stay in SG,btohqsg
But if you look at the Soviet Union  they produced so many outstanding mathematicians,btohqsg
Imo i will still prob stay in sg,btohqsg
that's cuz they had a motivation to compete,btohqsg
PSC in particular guarantees a smooth career  so u don‚Äôt have them leaving,btohqsg
Sg offers some intangible benefits other countries dont,btohqsg
we just need ppl to work,btohqsg
Yeah Eastern Europe and Russia have many smart scientists,btohqsg
I came over to SG years ago and now I am questioning my own decision too,btohqsg
PSC also allows to defer NS,btohqsg
But some people don't want the bond,btohqsg
If they really don‚Äôt want to stay in SG  that‚Äôs more of an overall brain drain problem than just for the geniuses,btohqsg
NS is honestly just 2 years of precious life wasted,btohqsg
U either get PSC or enter med to defer NS,btohqsg
at the most impt point of ur life,btohqsg
im not even taking medicine ü§°ü§°,btohqsg
Thats why i said why not much nobel prize winners,btohqsg
But Israelis are not bad and they also have 2 years of NS  including women,btohqsg
I think scientific research wise  Singaporeans also aren‚Äôt really into it,btohqsg
Oh  that means they enlist you late,btohqsg
I recently had an English comprehension practice and the passage was about how SG values are hindering us from producing such people,btohqsg
english essay is like the time to just talk shit abt singapore honestly,btohqsg
I was the earliest in my batch,btohqsg
english compre becoming more and more propaganda-ish lol,btohqsg
I still don't get why it would be 2.85 years for you,btohqsg
Is it true that Singaporeans look down at PES F (exempted) people?,btohqsg
the other day i had a compre saying how protesting is bad,btohqsg
Idk if it‚Äôs true I heard companies won‚Äôt hire u,btohqsg
At least u can take the 0.85y as a legit gap year  do internship or something,btohqsg
If u get pes f for a ‚Äúdumb ‚Äú reason,btohqsg
Most companies dont even ask for ur PES  unless u enlist in civil service,btohqsg
Wouldn‚Äôt a company prefer F anyway,btohqsg
Well  isn't it the same as the others? They just enlist later,btohqsg
Nah I doubt it plays a factor,btohqsg
Yes but doesn't change the fact that it is 2.85 years,btohqsg
My 2 scholar teachers were corporals,btohqsg
MOE was desperate of teachers in the pastNot anymore,btohqsg
From 450 scholarships given out in 2010 to barely 150 last yr,btohqsg
Even so u r not exactly uncompetitive in terms of rank,btohqsg
Guess i shld have ord-ed as a recruit to 'stand out',btohqsg
No u should ORD as PFC,btohqsg
Technically private in NS is PFC,btohqsg
What I have heard it society looks down at them as they never went through the 'rite of passage'.,btohqsg
I mean they wont know if u dont say anyway,btohqsg
"This convo is more interesting than ""isolated free expansion vs adiabatic expansion:",btohqsg
That's why I agree with what Charles Yeo said on this,btohqsg
"""Elevation of certain demographic considered by the govt to be superior""",btohqsg
Not really sure why you are so fixated with human-centric notions of glory like a Fields medal,btohqsg
G. D. Mostow won a grand total of 0 Fields medal and 0 Abel prizes,btohqsg
L√°szl√≥ Lov√°sz  also won 0 Fields medals,btohqsg
Felix Klein lived before Fields Medals were awarded,btohqsg
I am not obsessed.What do you want me to say? I can't say that there are no 'outstanding' mathematicians in Singapore because(1) that is not true(2) what is 'outstanding'? We need some yardstick.Prizes implies outstanding mathematicians  but outstanding mathematicians does not necessarily imply prizes,btohqsg
Then show that you are good. You have way more time in your life than I do.,btohqsg
The fact that you are quoting non-Singaporean mathematicians' names already suggests something...But to be fair  all of them won some prize,btohqsg
Tutor and mentor in chemistry and experiments,btohqsg
Sorry. What do you mean by mentor?,btohqsg
No  prizes mean other humans like your work. It says nothing inherently magical about the mathematics done,btohqsg
let me show u another formula n+n=2n,btohqsg
Okay  but that means no Singaporean mathematician so far has produced something sufficiently liked by others.But nowadays  if a mathematician has proved something important enough  they will likely get awarded a prize anyways.And if it is 'magical' enough (whatever 'magical' is)  they would get a prize as well. Not necessarily the fields medal  but some other prize.,btohqsg
That depends on what n is  i.e. what set is n an element of.And whether multiplication by 2 is defined on that set.,btohqsg
And whether you can even define addition,btohqsg
Is SATs easier than A lvls,btohqsg
If I were to take the SATs even with a poly diploma technically I could apply to uni as well ritr,btohqsg
And it would mean lesser competition,btohqsg
Jk  thanks for helping me with chem  math and geography!,btohqsg
mine was abt mekong rivers for expository compre,btohqsg
But isn't it easier to get into a Singaporean university using A levels?,btohqsg
whether hydroelectric dams are a double edged sword,btohqsg
and abt a man riding a horse in oman for narrative text,btohqsg
If SAT was held in the same regard by our unis as A Levels  why do u think people are still doing A levels,btohqsg
Because they seem to prefer A level graduates. A levels is more rigourous.Even for IB  they require a higher standard than A levels.And I'm talking about Singapore A levels. If it is other A levels  i would imagine they have a much more stringent requirement,btohqsg
This is despite my impression of IB being much harder than As,btohqsg
I understand why it‚Äôs not rigorous as As and knowing that a lvls have certain standards also la,btohqsg
Do unis look at local SATs tho if let‚Äôs say they have a poly cert as well,btohqsg
Do u mind sharing how much you scored and your experience?,btohqsg
Suss tho  but I have relevant working experience.. for nus ntu u need to score at least 1250/1600with easy and subjects to be considered,btohqsg
Fundamentally A levels and SAT  while equivalent  are not on the same absolute level,btohqsg
I was 80/1600 off nus cut off point so I didn‚Äôt bother applying,btohqsg
SAT is easier because the US system only ramps up well into university,btohqsg
I would say the difficulty of SAT is between O level and A level  being a lot closer to A level,btohqsg
I was thinking instead of a lvls to apply for SATs since I never took a,btohqsg
SAT is more of width A level is depth,btohqsg
From my understanding American universities also look at A levels. SAT is only a standardised test that supplements the As,btohqsg
SAT tests more content but less depth,btohqsg
A level tests less content but goes deep,btohqsg
If u applying science course u def need take science subject test  the general Sat paper and essay,btohqsg
While some universities no longer make SAT compulsory  they still treat A-levels just like your high school final exam,btohqsg
but nowadays universities look at ur AP classes more as compared to SAT so u wanna consider applying AP classes in addition to ur SAT paper,btohqsg
A lvl h2 Chem thermodynamics is nowhere near deep,btohqsg
What qualifications do u currently have ?,btohqsg
chill man it is only JC if we go to deep the world will run out of chemist üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Laughs when i now have to learn how to integrate the boltzmann distribution function,btohqsg
stop flexing with all these shit man,btohqsg
i wanna cry tears of blood,btohqsg
What qualifications u currently have and what do you wanna apply for,btohqsg
Yes you obtain the result ‚àö(3kT/m),btohqsg
Luckily I never took A levels chemistry.,btohqsg
Did u learn that in physics,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionwhy do they add people from here to that group,btohqsg
Ostensibly because our groups have similar themes?,btohqsg
