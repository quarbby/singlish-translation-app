My citibank credit card application took about 3 weeks and multiple chasers. Am and existing citibank credit card holder too..,btohqsg
lol i also applied  dont have false hope. just go for AMEX TCB,btohqsg
Should be the promotional signup 10% bonus,btohqsg

Hi  need to activate for overseas usage for credit cards that are link to Amaze card?,btohqsg

After applying for an account last Wed (1 week ago)  SIF finally video called me today (via WhatsApp) for the verification. Have to show face + flash front & back of IC. However once that was done  account was activated within 1 hr.The SIF mobile app is nth spectacular  might feel a bit clunky but does its job. Available to do FAST transfers  so I tested transferring monies in and out of the acct  it was almost instant (unlike SingLife acct where there is a short lag time of 5-10 mins).,btohqsg
First pic is the login page  can activate Touch/ Face ID.Second pic is the Account Summary page  just shows you the bare minimum.Third pic is the Transfers page  again very barebones but does the job and shows you how much of your daily transfer limit is left.,btohqsg
Get cimb first if got bad historical record hahahahaThen slowly built reputationI got mine uob one in 2week after applying,btohqsg
Will update again in relation to the advertised 2.5% interest when it is credited ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
Does it applies for all banks?,btohqsg
my credit score is the highest - AA. so no problem with that. itâ€™s just UOB being UOB.,btohqsg
Yw mine was rejected by Citi before,btohqsg
Except the long processing time for UOB  is it better to apply for UOB absolute or Amex TCB? Like easier to waive fees for UOB or better new to Amex promos for other Amex cards that would be wasted by getting Amex TCB?,btohqsg
I have signed up for Citi SMRT card. After reading terms and conditions. I have some matters to clarify/confirm1) Avoid using google pay/samsung pay/apple for both online and offline transactions correct?2) What about atome  favepay  shopback? Tagged directly to Citi SMRT card ok?3) Offline transaction using physical card will only earn base rate 0.3% at retail stores eg:Harvey Norman. Buy online at Harvey Norman website will earn bonus 4.7%,btohqsg
I signed up for nestia and paid $10  but didn't receive the cashback. What did I do wrongly?,btohqsg
The promo is over  no cashback anymore,btohqsg
Think any uob card will be slow,btohqsg
1. I use Citi SMRT for Simplygo via Apple Pay2. Paired with ShopBack Pay and got 5% cashback,btohqsg
Anyone knows what's UOB One ccard's min. income for foreigners? Some website said 40k some website said 80k  and there was no clarification in their website lol,btohqsg
