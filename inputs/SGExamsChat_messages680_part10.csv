and back then shit were way more condensed and complicated too,btohqsg
Any good math tutors to recommend for secondary school? Can dm me. Thanks! :),btohqsg
Tbh  the math itself is not very difficult. The main difficulty will probably be trying to apply the math to economic concepts,btohqsg
I will say itâ€™s a balanced mix of both,btohqsg
Just donâ€™t take uni econs just cause u can bs well in a-level econs,btohqsg
Especially if ur math foundation is weak  u will die,btohqsg
yes... the difficulty lies in linking the 2 together and acting fast coz time constraint,btohqsg
tbh it is not really h2 math + econs  the math in uni econs is not really to the level of h2 math,btohqsg
lmao this is weird  idk what they doing  if im the cher  i will also be very confused,btohqsg
I mean if u take higher-level econs mods  some of these require mathematical knowledge higher than h2 math  but of course not to the level of taking uni math itself lol. But the main point is knowing how to apply the math to econs,btohqsg
ok tbh im just talking intro mod coz im taking it as an elective so the math is not that difficult,btohqsg
you are in y1 now is it,btohqsg
My microecons 1 mod  by lesson 3 alr throw in partial differentiation alr lol,btohqsg
i actually hv this friend in ntu double major econs + math,btohqsg
mine was i think in lecture 5 iirc,btohqsg
but i did kinda miss doing math,btohqsg
and i lucky i did not throw everything away,btohqsg
then why they dw group tgt first sia......wah it is really a mess like what ur cher say,btohqsg
and u know what the funny thing is. the math mod for econs students donâ€™t teach them partial differentiation until week 4,btohqsg
oh im also doing ddp with eee haha. i also know a few math and econs friends  think entire 4 year enrollment got 39,btohqsg
nope  sorry. i only know like one from my batch,btohqsg
he also eee and econs ah,btohqsg
I think he told me before he do this ddp coz he wanna be teacher,btohqsg
Actually idk how this guy got close to mrs pang,btohqsg
yeah this sem he same class as me for one of the tutorials,btohqsg
I think she is fr batch,btohqsg
I dunno her class but she fr co,btohqsg
I think lexuan also fr tm,btohqsg
Btw tmjcians yâ€™all want a bit of tea,btohqsg
So im not sure if mr yusof the pe cher is still in the sch,btohqsg
Oh god he was my pe cher and always release us 30min late for recess,btohqsg
So apparently  i heard that i think2019/2020  he became soccer teacher ic and then the mj chers got angry and try to get him out of the cca lol,btohqsg
what type of tea is that,btohqsg
This reminds me of always bring a packet of milo as energy booster to my econs class coz 1st period 2h econs:-(,btohqsg
I have never drank bottled green tea,btohqsg
Actually my econs cher gave me that idea coz she always brings a packet milo to classðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
And i decided to follow suit,btohqsg
Coz i mean i was sleeping avg of 3h in j2,btohqsg
technically if you sleep 3 hours at home and three hours at school you are sleeping 6 hours,btohqsg
too many sihui out there alrâ€¦itâ€™s the female version of jun jie,btohqsg
apparently the human body was nvr meant to sleep 8hrs straight. 4hrs at night 4 hrs in day time,btohqsg
itâ€™s okay i know three calistas,btohqsg
I was real crazy in j2 coz im not smart so i need to work crazy to get what i wanted,btohqsg
Actually i blacked out during pe before,btohqsg
And then when i was ok  the cher insisted i let my parents know,btohqsg
Well said but actually i cant sleep in the day  i can fall asleep on my desk but when i go to bed or really want a nap  i cant:-(,btohqsg
