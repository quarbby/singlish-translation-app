Can dbs woman earn miles from atome installation?,btohqsg
It makes u spend more basically to 800,btohqsg
Does it require to be of certain category? Any cap?,btohqsg
Hsbc should be up to 4.65% for registration made between 1 June - 15 June. Not 4.45%,btohqsg
After you factor in 3.25% fx fee for the $200  the cashback will be much lesser.,btohqsg
Did you see the date I sent the message? Editing of message is disabled after 2 days.,btohqsg
Got cap. RM spend is a category on its own. But if you spend at supermarket in Msia  it will clock the Grocery category first instead of RM category. You can read up MBFF tnc  the terms are clear.,btohqsg
Yup I saw 4 June.But the 4.65% promo started 1 June.,btohqsg
They updated the promo on 6 Jun. It was still 4.45% on 1 Jun.,btohqsg
Oh hsbc backdate the promo start date?,btohqsg
Hi  need some clarification. When spending with instarem amaze+crmc  is the 1% fee applicable to spending 1k (exact) or above 1k,btohqsg
Need some advices.About Evol new enhanced benefits  Not sure which part of my calculation is wrong on spending $800 per month.$500 => $50 CB on Online/Mobile/FX$200 => -$6.5 FX fee 3.25%$300 => $0.90 CB on Other CatCB % = ($50+$0.90-$6.5)/$800 x 100%= $44.40/$800 x 100%= 5.55%If only spend locally  it will be ($30+$1.5)/$800 x 100% = 3.94%,btohqsg
How about normal Installment? Do these earn miles as well?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  xnap is down. Cant install and cannot be found on app store. Website stated maintenance. What other apps u all use to pay SGQR (using credit card)?,btohqsg
Which UOB card would yall be changing to?,btohqsg
DBS wwmc should be able to earn on Atome,btohqsg
Already have that ðŸ˜‚ need a UOB card to clock the $500 minimums spend for UOB One account,btohqsg
Why Your Net Worth Supercharges after $100 000https://youtu.be/tQt6ZhCd4Sk,btohqsg
For large purchase and want to split bill   is there alternative CC for OCBC NXT/ SCB SMART ?,btohqsg
"The FX fee already counted as part of spend because they don't charge it as a separate transaction. You spend ""more"" on the product but it's part of the $800. But yes  you'll get lesser cashback if you minus the fees off the cashback received.We didn't include the other spend cashback also. Both your calculation is right if you do the above 2.",btohqsg
Xnap down very long alr. You can search through the chat to see all the past discussions.,btohqsg
i am looking at UOB Lazada card.. is it worth ah? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
got such card? I thought it's Citi that has the Lazada card.,btohqsg
1k is the cap for 4 mpd  not the min.,btohqsg
Are we getting CDC vouchers this month? Like no news of it,btohqsg
It is a new one lor.. I just saw while looking at UOB website. I see it is min spend 700â€¦ slightly better than the new EVOL? Hahaha,btohqsg
It counts!!! That is why I consider lor. It not one account  I donâ€™t use UOB alr ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Of course. Some people even open Lady's Savings account to clock extra 2 mpd,btohqsg
Lady card unless u got the higher tier one if not then category is limited,btohqsg
oh interesting  I didn't know. All along thought it's EVOL  ONE  and Lady's Card only,btohqsg
"But you spend enough on Lazada to make use of the cashback or not? Because the ""cashback"" is in the form of captive Lazada currency  have to spend on Lazada to make use.",btohqsg
So itâ€™s 3.25%  not 3.5% markup? ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I also just saw it! Seems to be quite new.. but 15% for lazada spend is not bad.. just the cap a bit low..,btohqsg
Yeah you are right. I guess it only makes sense for ppl who shop on Lazada often.. hahaha.. let me go and do some more research first.. see if it makes sense.,btohqsg
I saw min spend is 700.. it is kind of better after this EVOL changes  before that  still EVOL better lor,btohqsg
Not sure if anyone shared  but I can confirm hsbc ega giro payments to financial institutions for insurance premium and car loan repayment still earn the 1% interest,btohqsg
Hi gurus  how do you transfer from one account to UOB one account as salary to qualify for the 6%?,btohqsg
If u got uob one and ocbc 360 u can try ocbc Any ooc,btohqsg
Stack both up which im planning to be since Evol nerf,btohqsg
Just do a fast transfer select salary from dbs appOr ocbc paynow on the webpage,btohqsg
Donâ€™t do that. It could possibly nerf it permanently.,btohqsg
Huh why will it get nerf,btohqsg
Transfer from DBS  OCBC bank account via FAST to UOB One using salary purpose. And the interest is 4% EIR. Please read the tnc,btohqsg
Sigh.. I donâ€™t know if should continue saving at UOB one  OCBC 360 or other places..,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I register for earmark uob sms today . Should I wait for next promo or just deposit before 29 June assuming I'm new to bank.,btohqsg
Then see which criteria fits you the most  uob need 500 spending  ocbc you can choose not to spend and just increase mab by 500On the balance of 20k  ocbc 360 is leading,btohqsg
I checked the OCBC calculator  about $6 more than UOB. If only credit+save. I do spend $500 on UOB one now. Actually my spending around 1k+/- monthly.,btohqsg
Then see if your spending works well with ocbc cards  then itâ€™s a 3.85% iirc excluding your card rewardsBut I believe uob cards is better even if talking about uob one,btohqsg
I thinking my cashback return from UOB one card will be more than OCBC 365.. but the bank interest OCBC more than UOB. Headache haha. I donâ€™t like UOB 500 1000 2000 spend also donâ€™t like 365 merchant 5814 removed.. a big turn off. I thinking until headache liao.,btohqsg
Guys . I just check hsbc EGA account minimum balance is 2k . So is ok. Affordable to many of us. Don't need put a lot,btohqsg
