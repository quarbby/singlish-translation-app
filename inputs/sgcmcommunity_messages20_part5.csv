If you ever been to kelantan or Terengganu  that will be basically be some benchmarking,btohqsg
Their chendol only rm3 using good green stuffs not those with colorings.,btohqsg
I think most folks with cars go in look for petrol and car wash. 🤣,btohqsg
You must not compare this way. Because there will always be outliers. You got to compare with cititts,btohqsg
Yes. KL JB Klang pj Penang,btohqsg
Even in second tier cities like kulai extremely high too,btohqsg
I got friends migrated there. Or put it as back to his kampung 😂,btohqsg
I don’t like Penang. Too many trees. Very spooky,btohqsg
Can do nice drive all days there,btohqsg
Got durians too which hardly deliver to sg,btohqsg
Ya lor. So many will go try when they are touring there.,btohqsg

why is he selling? spur of moment buying?,btohqsg
OI imports but dont have to be registered,btohqsg
In general dealer stock can be unregistered for a while,btohqsg
i forgot the rules  can PI import NEW cars?,btohqsg
You can import your own self too,btohqsg
yes anyone can import. challenge is finding a workshop,btohqsg
if the amount is not big like in malayia  can take such risk,btohqsg
Not really  you can just go to any specialist,btohqsg
There was a time where many import used cars too.,btohqsg
Or better still  some import car but not registered to drive on sg roads,btohqsg
this i know. of course the outside one will take whatever. it is business to them,btohqsg
So the cost of ownerships is definitely lower,btohqsg
the dealer wont want to service your car,btohqsg
Depending on your worth i guess.,btohqsg
in malaysia  recon cars can be serviced by dealers. they dont care you dont buy from them,btohqsg
many diret import cars from japan are as good as new. ,btohqsg
the only problem in malayisa is you cannot do it yourself to import,btohqsg
you got to find a licensed importer with a AP,btohqsg
Can go to the AD also,btohqsg
For them it is business  they will just make you pay the full price no free service,btohqsg
Got money anything also can as long no crimes involved. 😝,btohqsg
they wont want to entertain at all,btohqsg
and would specify ridiculous price just so hat you cannot accuse them for not doing your car. this is how they deter you,btohqsg
"in malaysia  some dealers like Autobavaria (BMW top dealer) would charge rm20K to open ""account"". while 2nd tier dealers would not mind",btohqsg
Not too different  usually for ICE cars they can still work on them,btohqsg
Main differences can be the language that the obd reads in originally but that can be changed. Mechanically most of them are the same or similar,btohqsg
They do actually  take a PI Mercedes to c&c  they will be happy to service. Of course at a cost,btohqsg
Just that they will not offer their 10 year engine & gearbox warranty which is only offered if you buy and service with them,btohqsg
you are not treated equal. i already said they will charge you HIGH just aso you cannot complain to principle,btohqsg
they ill quote you so high you wont want to do it,btohqsg
Actually roughly the same price  they will just charge a bit more for scanning and may try to add on some more repairs hoping you don't see or don't understand,btohqsg
You're definitely not treated equal and why would you be? You're not paying them their agent mark up after all,btohqsg
no no. you are paying them service fees regardless whether you buy from them or not.  this is service department costs.  not from their sales department.,btohqsg
But many PIs nowadays will offer their own workshops and warranties  very common because of the c&c 10 year warranty. Cars and coffee  jack cars  etc. will offer a similar warranty as long as you service with them,btohqsg
Agreed  but it's a business as a whole mah  they won't treat you the same so that next time you think of buying from them for end to end solution. Save money must deal with stuff like this,btohqsg
what if you import your own?,btohqsg
Still similar  either go to the AD and do  they will treat you the same as any other dealer PI or you go outside,btohqsg
Most people buying PI cars or importing themselves will not want to go to the AD anyway as in majority of their cases the aim is to save money  the savings continue by going for repairs outside which are much cheaper,btohqsg
