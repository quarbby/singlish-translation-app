For O levels is like 3 each,btohqsg
during one of my A lvl exam the invigilator made a series of farts,btohqsg
2 experiment each + 1 planning each,btohqsg
wait im confused already  these are foreign to me,btohqsg
i only had 1 day leh,btohqsg
by 5 assessments i mean there's 3 assessment components  and 2 of those are done twice,btohqsg
so how your sch does it is gonna vary,btohqsg
it can't be just one experiment tho,btohqsg
maybe it is just my school with its funny ways,btohqsg
oh i meant i only had 1 practical exam  but w i forgot how many qns,btohqsg
some schools i know have like 1 in sec 3  rest in sec 4,btohqsg
maybe my school bunch them all in 1 setting,btohqsg
why do you think my prof was saying how stupid it was,btohqsg
they probs realised it was stupid before 2010 but the guy need to fuck off first,btohqsg
today i learnt that my schools does things funnily???,btohqsg
"""SPA will take place over an appropriate period that the candidates are offering the subject"" so in theory can test anytime from sec 3 to 4",btohqsg
just one practical test for 20% of the grade,btohqsg
looks like the same things i did for As tbh,btohqsg
i mean for A levels you're just graded based on your answers,btohqsg
the SPA lets teachers evaluate even how you do the experiment,btohqsg
oh right i remembered that part,btohqsg
i prob got B3 for chem due to the practical,btohqsg
so it was stupid bc imagine getting on your teachers bad side,btohqsg
and they just make up stuff to mark you down,btohqsg
coz my chem was always higher than my phy,btohqsg
true  they should maybe let another cher come in,btohqsg
yea so no surprise that the system was scrapped,btohqsg
i forgot to close the tap of the burette and everything spilled onto the chair,btohqsg
that is why never be in ur chers bad books,btohqsg
it's also dumb imo to be marked down for stuff like that bc accidents happen,btohqsg
"i rmb some sites literally say ""be good friends with your teachers if possible""",btohqsg
my cher stared at me and came to me was like 'aiyo  na' --> came to me w a toilet roll,btohqsg
wow...i think it is impossible for me,btohqsg
especially till now im still the quiet and shy type,btohqsg
just that in jc i spoke more else the tutor will be talking to the wall,btohqsg
sometimes i asked myself am i too much  but when i dont talk  the classroom is quiet,btohqsg
ngl that's a very sg thing,btohqsg
the keep quiet in class part,btohqsg
I do that in uni lectures :D  not much in uni tutorials,btohqsg
Our lts are very small in spms :D,btohqsg
yea that one depends on your cohort,btohqsg
i am my team's spokesperson lol coz 2 people in my group dun give any shit  the other 2 are quiet and dun speak up,btohqsg
hmm it's more common for them still to ask after class and not respond during the lesson itself,btohqsg
i remembered in y2 there was a zoom lesson  and it was at 2pm  then i was a bit late coz went to grab lunch...then i did not expect my grp to be called first  then when i went back up  i see someone messaging us where are we instead of answering lol,btohqsg
then just silence the prof lmao,btohqsg
ig bc you have groupings for tutorials. i hardly had anything like that,btohqsg
i got a bit of a shock in a good way when i went for my postgrad lectures,btohqsg
bc everyone was way more responsive and enthu  asking questions  interacting with the prof,btohqsg
sometimes even figuring out mistakes tgt bc it's higher level stuff,btohqsg
i got back in time but i cant answer coz i missed the entire presentation from the other grp so cannot make comments / feedbacks,btohqsg
