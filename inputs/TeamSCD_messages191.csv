Prices are incluing COE right? That's quite cheap what,btohqsg
Compared to cars like tesla all these,btohqsg

ic the tesla can just anyhow change the car horn,btohqsg
press liao can say yamate kudasai,btohqsg

If i have a 2nd car i'll prolly just leave it parked,btohqsg
If you ask me choose MRT or EV,btohqsg
then yeah i'll lan lan just drive,btohqsg
so you chose an ev train over an ev car,btohqsg
If i'm a passenger of anything,btohqsg
I actually miss taking public transport,btohqsg
Can stop on the way at some MRT stations to visit a shop.,btohqsg
then u tired can chill n all,btohqsg
Wanna take a stop  means need to detour  park your car go down.,btohqsg
Waste time and waste carpark money,btohqsg
But despite all that  i stil wouldn''t give up car ownership for public transport,btohqsg
but there are just things i missed,btohqsg
i mean those things at the end of the day is just quality of life thing,btohqsg
Sit MRT can look out of the window and stone also,btohqsg
I prefer to get jam in express way then kanna jam in mrt,btohqsg
bus drivers and taxi drivers i realised  their throttle and brake is either 1 or 0,btohqsg
ys bro sometimes they think yhey racing,btohqsg
then like drive got launch control like thsg,btohqsg
Wah i hate jams in expressways,btohqsg
not because i drive a manual  but it's very frustrating,btohqsg
then bikes going at 50kmh when you at standsti,btohqsg
then you scared you bang them when you can't see them coming,btohqsg
sometimes ic my father wan cut ah,btohqsg

It's like saying government no good  but every election you vote pap,btohqsg
Oh no i dont vote PAP,btohqsg
I dont have to justify to u,btohqsg
But i've nv voted PAP once in my entire life,btohqsg
Give us money  then increase gst. Really wtf,btohqsg
our currency is 1sgd to 3 ringgit right....,btohqsg
I only vote against PAP cos like what Jamus said  cannot give them a blank cheque,btohqsg
PAP is good  but they aren't perfect. We still need voices of opposition in our government.,btohqsg
for me very simple  you keep our money big  our passport powerful,btohqsg
tax is lower then many other places,btohqsg
cars are fucking expensive  but we can afford for some reason,btohqsg
At the end of the day  our citizens not starving,btohqsg
we got stupid people la that one can't be helped,btohqsg
So everything is really a win  just that singaporeans too free everything also wanna whine,btohqsg
At least u own a two door car,btohqsg
Honestly even WP also not very good,btohqsg
simple  if you got no complains about your life now  then just vote the current one  if you not happy  try another one,btohqsg
Sometime we don‚Äôt want to vote for pap. But when u look at other party sigh. End up pap better,btohqsg
nt ez lah. win already the estate dont get support liao,btohqsg
then see if your gst there is higher or lower,btohqsg
My only complain is our wage gaps between the rich and poor getting bigger. But that one really is more of a society thing. Every country suffering from it.,btohqsg
like they just anyhow grab any cock on the street and put them in,btohqsg
they grab those political taxi uncles or coffeeshop uncles,btohqsg
Like you wanna complain  complain with a solution,btohqsg
Is like I trying to vote for other party. Then other party sigh cmi sia,btohqsg
but i do find it annoying  was watching mighy car mods  they bought a swift sport for 7k,btohqsg
like 7k and its yours wtffff,btohqsg
So many times they complain  ask them how they can improve our lives  no answer or side track change topic,btohqsg
singaporean... like to complain... dont care will win or lose... just complain,btohqsg
But nonetheless  i voted against PAP  i just want them to know they cannot be complacent.,btohqsg
they only think 1 line... cannot branch out de,btohqsg
One day they fucked up  they must know that people will vote against them  not vote out of loyalty or fear.,btohqsg
without them supporting  sg will collapse,btohqsg
Honestly  the fear is the boomers come out with also,btohqsg
All scared say cannot get BTO or smlj one,btohqsg
I nv vote PAP before also got my BTO on 2nd try,btohqsg
they secretly prioritize their own voters de,btohqsg
then how come i can get my BTO,btohqsg
see wan pay car or pay income tax..,btohqsg
those nv buy car in sg de.. v shiok,btohqsg
bcos u secretly vote for them,btohqsg
I rmb i voted for PSP,btohqsg
