i heard some ppl are boycotting starbucks and mcd but idk why,btohqsg
i just went to bali and they had sales on starbies,btohqsg
but dw will come again one,btohqsg
"To be frank I see people ""boycott Starbucks"" but the entire Starbucks is still fill",btohqsg
dude that was me but i saw the amount of antisemitism and got pissed,btohqsg
The same person is probably going to go back to McDonald's a few months later,btohqsg
okay maybe i should use my alt to say this,btohqsg
eh i dont support or condemn either side,btohqsg
i saw a pro palestine protester shouting boycott nike but she was wearing af1s,btohqsg
i js hopr the civilians are safe,btohqsg
we share the same half a braincell rand,btohqsg
I heard its alternative is old Chang kee cafe,btohqsg
the other half of ur braincell is the FA side,btohqsg
but personally I endorse mcdonalds boycott due to the high prices of filet o fish,btohqsg
i boycott it in hopes that they will lower prices(fat chance),btohqsg
anyway for this  silly yes. stupid idk bc this sort of post usually gives half the story only. but like genuine fear not like can snap her out of it by calling it stupid,btohqsg
they need to enlist or some shit eh,btohqsg
im very scared my uni has this kind of acoustic fucks,btohqsg
like it feels drastic to go from what they said happened to fearing every single male on the planet,btohqsg

You just finished a level ?,btohqsg
"You remind me of this study on the human brain and the ""fight or flight "" response",btohqsg
the only thing stopping me from doinng a second deg/major related to my interests on the arts side is im scared ill meet the woke idiots,btohqsg
good sir do i look that young,btohqsg
the thing is theres a high chance im sorry,btohqsg
you'll def meet the woke idiots,btohqsg
its just that like liberal arts majors tend to attract A LOT of libleft ppl,btohqsg
some of them can be quite friendly and reasonable,btohqsg
but usually the friendly ones arent as loud as the siao ones,btohqsg
alls fun and games until u get close to someone and u realise theyre woke,btohqsg
then u have to cut them off,btohqsg
i always thought i was a centrist liberalüò≠,btohqsg
i am but the ‚Äúcentre‚Äù is moving far left these days,btohqsg
the extremes at both ends tend to be the loudest,btohqsg
but they arent representative of the majority ppl who may have some views (eg. Support same gender marriage  universal healthcare) but generally dgaf,btohqsg
i wish i cld go back to being political apathetic,btohqsg
but once u get into it u cant get out,btohqsg
just like my poker and drinking addiction,btohqsg
i just try not to think about things as black or white,btohqsg
if not damn easy to get biased,btohqsg
(on a side note if anyone wants to poker pm me i host quite often),btohqsg
I'll give an example that affected majority of us here  me included.It's the change in HDB BTO pricing policy to consider it a discount to surrounding pricesas compared to charging by building costs.,btohqsg
How it affects... Most of you aren't at the stage of working and saving up a retirement nest.Any massive inflation will  for most people 1) delay retirement plans  or2) go back from retired to working because insufficient retirement funds.,btohqsg
But pretty sure that dude isnt 18 yet,btohqsg
Anyways anyone wan buy us stocks please use ibkr,btohqsg
Personally my parents are a bit worried they may outlast their retirement savingsI'm telling them as long as I'm working and they need the $$  just get from me. It's the least I could do.,btohqsg
