Hi there considering merc a class sedan or cla  better than 2 Series and x3? Any promos for motorshow,btohqsg
no one went to the car show?,btohqsg
after seeing so many cars  suddenly feel that i'm driving crap,btohqsg
If you're getting it for features and the interior  the a class/CLA might be better,btohqsg
A class slightly more room than the CLA,btohqsg
The driving dynamics of the 2 are pretty good and it has some ambient lighting too which people usually look for in the segment,btohqsg
A3 is a a good platform as well and the 1.0 turbo is pretty punchy in a car that size,btohqsg
There is a promo on for Audi and Merc at the motorshow,btohqsg
Price not much changes compared to the car show in July 2022,btohqsg
