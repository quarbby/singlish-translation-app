Seems like G Invacom have been much overlooked. There is potential and many catalyst to be a popular penny in future.Watch video below to understand more on their businesses involved.https://youtu.be/-kzPalFC6R0,btohqsg
Just checked out G Invacom chart.Here’s the analysis’s- an obvious OBV divergence signals artificial price compression to flush.- Base Building $0.052 to $0.056 for potential reversal- illiquid and at low volume now. Price at a cheap for those who have holding power at liquidity always comes at a premium.The NAV of this counter is $0.22.Their business nature is a big beneficiary of many of the happenings in the world at the moment.This one might come alive anytime IMO. Because of the way it fell  it will rise fast when the BBs come.Hence  buy call $0.052 to $0.056 especially if you have holding power.$0.050 breaks with volume   then consider SL.It’s a good RRR here I would say. There’s room for a good gains here.DYODD. Market can change anytime and we have to react and adjust accordingly. This is to be for all counters too. Always manage your own risk,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 2 December 2022🎉🎯Take a chill pill: It’s December🍏The equity market followed a clueless trading session and seesawed while pausing risk-on sentiments. However  recent gains were consolidated given that the Fed is on pace to moderate the pace of interest rate hikes  and that is pleasant to the ears of investors.Ultimately  there’s one more overhang on the equity market. It’s Friday’s job report that we have been eyeing. Before the release  few traders want to be aggressively bullish.🎲More signs of inflation cooling🔑The PCE index  often seen as the Fed’s preferred inflation reading  showed further signs of weakening. It rose by 6% over the year  lower than the forecast of 6.2%. It is also another tick down from the prior reading of 6%.As more signs of inflation moderate  equity markets can gain momentum to move higher if investors are convinced that a soft landing is in place and the spread of corporate earnings recession is kept at bay.On the flip side  the labour market seems healthy as weekly jobless claims fell to 225 000  lower than previous readings. Markets aim to see more such claims to signal the Fed to be more risk-averse towards aggressive rate hikes.🧸Salesforce: Corporate sending showing more cracks🕹The company registered a 4Q forecast that is well short of analysts’ forecasts  which dampens the broader industry's mood. Yet another sign of slower corporate spending sending a chill across the technology industry as winter might finally arrive for the sector.🚘Chargepoint: Moving ahead💎The EV charging company has been brutally hit in this year's market sell-off. Yet  there are some glitters to the stock. While there is an earnings miss  investors look at sales metrics more closely than ever. After all  ChargePoint is still in the phase of growth mode.Full-year sales guidance is revised with the bottom range increase from $450 million to $475 million  a mild good sign for the company. The company has about $400 million of cash in its balance sheet at the end of the 3Q.It is a stock that Pika World is exploring an entry for growth stocks that are in the small capitalization category.📮What's on the menu today?🔭We will receive the Nonfarm Payroll for November at 9.30 pm. We are expecting a 200K level compared to 261 K.At 10.56 pm  we will also have the unemployment and participation rates. Average hourly earnings will also come into the picture. Ideally  we hope for income growth to slow to reduce its feed into the inflation bedrock.It is 2 December  Friday  at 9.05 am in Singapore and 8.05 pm in New York. It is the week's final trading day  and Pika World wishes all friends an enchanting weekend ahead!,btohqsg
