After deposit then spend 500 monthly to uob one card,btohqsg
When do they usually credit the interest?,btohqsg
For example of all your uob accounts add up to $5 123 on 30th June 2023. Out of which $1000 is in uob ONE account.U want to earmark $100 000.U need to keep $101 000 in your uob ONE account throughout the promo. And your total uob balance throughout promo must be $105 123 and above.,btohqsg
For the $558  on the same day as the earmark happening.,btohqsg
Wow cant take out the interest Ah?,btohqsg
Because new sign ups were closed for almost a month now. And the interest rate is shite anyway,btohqsg
2.68% no frills is still quite good.,btohqsg
Can but only the interest. The rest of the money you take out as long as you put in back the same or more amount on the same day ü§£Jokes aside you can take out as much after the earmarked date.,btohqsg

IMPORTANT NOTES:1. Open a CIMB Savings Account online by 30 Sep '23 with at least S$1 000 for savings and S$5 000 for current account.2. Maintain or increase your current month's end balance against the previous month's end balance.,btohqsg
Yup that's all  kinda no frills don't you think?,btohqsg

I think there is fix deposit for SRS with different rate for different bank(DBS UOB),btohqsg
Means every month - also need to put some $$  to maintain the 3.5% interesr....( Must right?)?,btohqsg
You can don't money in. Just make sure net amount doesn't decrease.,btohqsg
No money in also get 3.5%,btohqsg
