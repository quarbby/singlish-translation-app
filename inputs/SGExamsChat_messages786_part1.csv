How did chou tien chien beat viktor axelsen,btohqsg
Are we gonna see the 3rd upset of the QF lmao,btohqsg
ive never lost to chou tien chien therefore im better than axelsen,btohqsg
been awhile since i watch badminton,btohqsg
Earlier on  Malaysia beat Japan (Men)  Indonesia beat Thailand (women)  now Chinese Taipei gonna beat 2nd seed Denmark (???),btohqsg
It is now 2-0 in favour of chinese taipei,btohqsg
See if anders antonsen can turn things ard (he losing 1st set tho),btohqsg
Because you have never played chou tien chienðŸ’€,btohqsg
There maybe another upset coz korea may outdo indonesia in the other menâ€™s qf clash,btohqsg
Dun be like me who stayed up till 5am to watch loh kean yew world champs finals,btohqsg
I think the match ended at 6amðŸ’€,btohqsg
Malaysia vs Japan not upset could have been 3-0,btohqsg
Neh Japan was the clear favourites,btohqsg
Malaysiaâ€™s first semi finals since 2016,btohqsg
But they may turn things ard if they had fielded kodai naraoka,btohqsg
they also not have their full team,btohqsg
Coz kenta nishimoto would hv defeated leong jun hao,btohqsg
But im guessing they put kenta in first singles coz he had a better h2h w lee zii jia than naraoka,btohqsg
Indonesia losing singles matches will be big upset,btohqsg
Coz if they fielded them both  naraoka would be in 1st singles and nishimoto 2nd singles,btohqsg
I was wondering why japan didnt really field naraoka (i think he only played 1 of 4 matches),btohqsg
Lin chun yi vs Anders antonsen (1-0),btohqsg
But if Antonsen somehow wins still could be 1-3 or 2-3,btohqsg
Why not they all win the last 3 matches,btohqsg
Apparently they did that in 2016,btohqsg
the rest of the matches are 50-50,btohqsg
Meanwhile I stayed up till 5 to a rerun of a internal soccer game at jalan besar stadium. After 3-4hrs. I still don't know who scored and who are the players,btohqsg
Dont think too much about it   the cher is probably just tired and sian because of a long day at work. Dontworry its not directed at you,btohqsg
Uber cup redemption for these small small players,btohqsg
Leong jun hao my friend sia,btohqsg
feels abit odd to see some of my p6 classmates on insta stepping down from their ccas,btohqsg
feels a bit odd to see someone whom I copied hw from in y2 get scolded for not doing hw today,btohqsg
i think kuro sent this here before,btohqsg
At least the teacher caresâ€¦tbh some students really be testing teacherâ€™s patience,btohqsg
My nausea came right at the night before my examGG.com,btohqsg

My stomach decided to cramp during my exam... works surprisingly well as a motivator for me to write as fast as possible,btohqsg
