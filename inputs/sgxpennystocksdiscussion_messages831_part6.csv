Malaysia still an attractive place to buy house considering how expensive HK and Singapore is  it’s the political instability which is a future dilemma coz everything so expensive and some political figure just like to use racial tension to gain power again.,btohqsg

"A summary of the 2023 state election results in six states! Read it all in one go!1) Both camps maintained a 3-to-3 ruling power  with the unity government in Penang  Selangor and Negeri Sembilan; and the green wave of the National Alliance in Kedah  Kelantan and Terengganu. The total turnout was 70.1%  a significant drop from 82.49% in 2018.By coalition vote share:🔴Pakatan Harapan (PH) 2 477 668 votes  36.1%🔵Barisan Nasional (BN) 921 804 votes  13.4%🟢Perikatan Nasional (PN) 3 382 454 votes  49.3%⚪️Others 74 417 votes  1.2%🔴🔵Unity government total vote share 49.5%🟢National Alliance total vote share 49.3%By state vote share: (winning side)Penang - Unity government 66.7%Selangor - Unity government 60.6%N.Sembilan - Unity government 60.8%Kedah - National Alliance 68.9%Kelantan - National Alliance 69.2%Terengganu - National Alliance 67.9%By seats won:🔴🔵Unity government 80 seats  representing 35.4% of the total seats in the six states🟢National Alliance 146 seats  representing 64.6% of the total seats in the six states2) Apart from the mainstream parties  independent candidates and third-force newcomers failed to break through  with MUDA losing deposits in all 19 seats contested  a non-combat crime  as most voters were more concerned about whether the unity government could retain its three original states.￼3) Within the 🔴🔵unity government camp  the total number of seats won dropped from 114 to 80. Apart from DAP's slight drop of two seats  the other parties suffered a sharp decline in seats.PKR 52 —> 26 DAP 48 —> 46AMANAH 14 —> 8UMNO 42 —> 194) Within the 🟢National Alliance camp  the total number of seats won rose from 88 to 146  with PAS's strength soaring.PAS 76 —> 105Bersatu 12 —> 405) This state election was a close fight between the two sides  with many winning seats being narrow victories. I define narrow victories as having a majority of less than 2000 votes. Examples are as follows:Penang: 🟢National Alliance four narrow wins  🔴PH one narrow win  🔵BN one narrow winSelangor: 🟢National Alliance eleven narrow wins  🔴PH three narrow winsN.Sembilan: 🟢National Alliance two narrow wins  🔴PH three narrow wins  🔵BN eight narrow winsKedah: 🔴PH one narrow winKelantan: 🔴PH one narrow winTerengganu: 🟢National Alliance one narrow win6) The 🟢National Alliance's narrow wins in Selangor led to its rise  from six seats to 22. 🔴PKR lost half of its seats in Selangor. The smallest margin of victory among the 🟢National Alliance's winning seats was only 30 votes.Examples:Taman Medan 30 votesGombak Setia 58 votesSungai Kandis 167 votesDengkil 407 votesBukit Melawati 877 votes￼7) Terengganu was swept by a green wave  with 🟢National Alliance winning all seats and 🔵UMNO left with none.8) In Kelantan  🔴AMANAH successfully planted its flag by winning one seat through a narrow victory  achieving a breakthrough; while 🔵UMNO only managed to retain one seat (down from eight in the previous term).9) In Kedah  🟢MCA successfully broke its duck by winning Kulim  a southern technological hub; among the three 🔴🔵unity government assemblymen who won in Kedah  all were Chinese; 🔴AMANAH failed to defend its seats; 🟢PAS swept all the seats it contested in Kedah; 🔵UMNO suffered a crushing defeat.10) In Negeri Sembilan  the 🔴🔵unity government remained strong  but 🟢National Alliance managed to break its duck by winning five seats; all eight seats won by 🔵UMNO were narrow victories.11) In Penang  DAP unsurprisingly won all the seats it contested  but one of the former strongholds of the prime minister  Permatang Pauh  lost all three state seats to the opposition; as in Selangor  PKR also lost half of its seats; the 🟢National Alliance grew stronger in the island's hinterland and the mainland's northern part.Conclusion:The unity government achieved its goal of retaining three state governments  but the ""hope for 3 + 1"" was apparently just some encouraging words to boost morale.",btohqsg
