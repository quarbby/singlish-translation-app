Yah I checked the number and it's official. But numbers can be altered mah,btohqsg
Good to be careful but if you don't trust it just don't do it lo.,btohqsg
I think I'll do with the screenshot,btohqsg
It's normal but for safety sake  i always contact customer service directly through the app instead of whatsapp,btohqsg
Yea I just want to be safe.,btohqsg
Dunno about yours  but Moomoo really did call me. To introduce herself in case I needed help etc. Same  also WA verified number,btohqsg
"Hi everyone  have a question. Webull has a ""earn up to 3 000USD cash voucher for bonus 3% of NCD promotion"". Am I right to say that if i deposit etc 10k and just put into sgd cash fund approx 3.5% per annum interest  thats 3.5%+3% = so effectively 6.5% per annum if i leave it there for 1 year of course the sgd cash fund rates might go down but assuming it stays around 3.5% is there anything im missing because guaranteed 6.5% sounds a little too good to be true. sorry my girlmath failing mee üôÅ",btohqsg
Same applies. Her name is Jacquelyn also?,btohqsg
Nope. Karina. But long time ago.,btohqsg
I see... They randomly handpick investor one ah?,btohqsg
Ahh okk. Never experience this when I had 150k in moomoo previously.. but suddenly got rope in when I only have 25k in moomoo now.. thus the precautions,btohqsg
Maybe they are triggered by your declining funds?,btohqsg

Hello  is WeChat pay sufficient or better to have both WeChat and AliPay to use in China?,btohqsg
That's great cos I'm have WeChat Pay atm  but not AliPay. But jus curious to ask  is the steps for AliPay the same as WeChat Pay? Like can add your credit card in.,btohqsg
Need give heads up to bank anot ah? Saw a few errors previously across different chat and I only got Alipay Soo,btohqsg
I rather u find a good friend in Hong Kong. Can be your backup and send you rmb into your Alipay or WeChat pay if u have trouble.,btohqsg
Both need identification verification if u want full features.,btohqsg
But both work the same by adding your credit card to pay right?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt do that method so I won‚Äôt comment. I know foreign cards have fees.I use China bank account method.,btohqsg
Another common method my friends use is to get rmb from China friends.They need sgd and u need rmb. So if your china friend visits. U give them SGD cash. They credit your Alipay.,btohqsg
I setup Alipay and WeChat in case any of one of them got issues. I used trust credit card cos of fx savings. Last year  there was a promo on SC Journey card and I added that. But this year  they didn‚Äôt extend the promo. I guess for now I will use trust credit card,btohqsg
Also saw another one (haven‚Äôt logged in for awhile)  seems like free $$ if we just deposit $1?,btohqsg
No fee for transactions below cny200,btohqsg

"its not via GIRO. its paynow. plus there is an option to select ""Salary Payment"". so in theory it should work. just wondering if anyone has succeeded before",btohqsg
ok. think no harm trying ocbc,btohqsg
So it works for OCBC as well. Good to know,btohqsg

Is the citi prestige offer for existing cardholders still applicable?Enteringhttps://hmsg.link/citiprestigestill shows the same offer for new-to-bank only.,btohqsg
Thanks! So it affect your normal call but WhatsApp call should be ok given data is ok. Ended up you have extra line?,btohqsg
yes correct. But institutions like banks  medical  or misc calls except those scams and spams calling  they wun be calling via watsapp.And so happens that month when i ported  i have house appts for broadband installations which they called during the day time and when i was in the office.Thats when i know the cellular calls signal is not there.In the end had to port out to another Telco.However legit  my other 2 lines for my dad and uncle is working all right. Just suay its my office loc (did voiced out the issues to them and they said they will ask their engineers to check out)But now i cannot check again whether its ok  as i have already ported out.,btohqsg
Thank you so much for the information.,btohqsg
Hi  wanted to check if Citi Rewards with XNAP qualifies as an online transaction? Or no?,btohqsg
Search chat history ‚ÄúXnap citi rewards‚Äù,btohqsg
Getting quite inconsistent information‚Ä¶I‚Äôm using Apple Pay so don‚Äôt think it CRMC+Amaze applies here,btohqsg
If anyone knows  will be very helpful. Thanks üôè,btohqsg
CRMC excludes mobile wallet transactions so if you use Xnap Apple Pay no 4mpd,btohqsg
Now Uob preferred platinum visa credit card can earn from uob$ merchant   it is true ?,btohqsg
Cashback  not miles and it has always been the case.,btohqsg
Hi all. I have 2 questions regarding UOB Lady's Card...1) Understand that UNI$ are rewarded per $5 dollar blocks. If I were to buy a drink from McDonalds for $2.50 and another drink from KFC $2.50. Does this add up to a single $5.00 block?2) Is there a way to track the spending per category so I know when to switch to another card when the cap is hit (e.g.  $1 000 for dining).,btohqsg
Also  I understand the FX rate for Amaze is not exactly the best. So  does it make sense to use Amaze + 1.5% Cash Back card overseas? Or should I just use Wise/Youtrip and miss out on credit card rewards?,btohqsg
