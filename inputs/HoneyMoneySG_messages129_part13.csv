Which is approx 4.8% for 100k? Correct?,btohqsg
T&C did not specify and deposit requirement  but have to deposit enough to execute your trades.Cash credit = deposit in ProsperUs accountRyde cash credit = deposit in Ryde car-hailing app wallet,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGJust to share that putting directly into h**c gif ultra short duration bond reaped higher return of 5.9867% / annum between 2 August to 3 Sep over 33 days for me. It performed much better than the estimated 4% / annum written in your article. So no need to put into cash plus for 30 days first  can go directly to this bond for 60 days and potentially earn more.,btohqsg

You should be careful when you deposit money into Revolut as they are not a proper bank. Your fund will not be protected. I summarized what happened to me last night.https://x.com/JAKEGLH/status/1831185160458453446,btohqsg
I think you can use crmc citi rewards master card. And you can use it directly in these scenarios since these are all online and you can get 4 mpd for a monthly cap of 1000$. Additionally there are no minimum spend requirements and in the long term you can find additional usage with Instarem Amaze as well,btohqsg
I read through ur posts. Revolut can be clearer for sure. Buts it's also scary you 1 shot that much to revolut acct.,btohqsg
