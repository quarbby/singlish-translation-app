Hi guys and ladies. I applied for UOB lady Solitaire card on sat 12pm. How to check it's status. I google and click into uob apps.. can't find the link.,btohqsg
Usually by 3 days they will reply you. Just got to be patient,btohqsg
I guess I be rejected .. as I only annual income 42 to 43k.. at least I tried apply for UOB ladies account . Is successful,btohqsg
go for the $30k version first,btohqsg
I have already.. because I want to have the 2 category bonus instead of 1,btohqsg
did you bring what i asked you to bring,btohqsg
Look out for the manhole.. don't just walk later fall inside. Jump over..,btohqsg
It will disappear after 6 months of non activity,btohqsg
I use by send msg to uob cards,btohqsg
Any of you here less than 120k is successful,btohqsg
Previously I applied Dbs woman card world. 80k annum salary. Surprisingly I got it,btohqsg
I cancel it ... after it no longer accepts amaze and from 2 years cut to 1 year expire points,btohqsg
Hi CRMC bonus pt limit refresh is calendar date or statement date?,btohqsg
I think now  Solitaire quite strict. They have a secured version  but dont think it's worth it,btohqsg
Fixed deposit 30k  at super low interest rates.,btohqsg
Lol... no point là..  rather put in spore saving bonds. About 3.5%,btohqsg
Some people try the app application method. Should get almost instant approval  if not can still check status.,btohqsg
I got it at way below requirement.All the lady woman card very useful.,btohqsg
You also got Dbs world woman card ?,btohqsg
i guess depends on when you got the card? For a short period i think they were quite lax with the income requirement. But now apparently is tightened.,btohqsg
Oh Wah.. I think I was lucky. 😅😁,btohqsg
150k really a lot.. that $$ I already invest in stock market,btohqsg
The reason why I want to get that card is because I want to put it under massage and facial... because I heard citi rewards under this only 0.4 to 1 miles earn only,btohqsg
Just get Uob ppv or Uob vs.Can get 4mpd,btohqsg
Yes.. uob preferred visa I also have...,btohqsg
Wah granny so fast lol I wanted to reply that,btohqsg
This card only worth if you can spend 6 to 10$ minimum,btohqsg
Sometimes I eat at yakun. Coffee only 2.10.. then I top up another muffin. To become about 5.70,btohqsg
Facial is at least 80 outside,btohqsg
Under $5 use amaze Crmc Loh,btohqsg
10% of it already put in lady saving account and also buy blue chip stock,btohqsg
Oh. God. Am i seeing things,btohqsg
Last time 6 mpd up to 3k spend so still ok to put secured haha,btohqsg
Is ok... if they reject . Because I still have the preferred card.,btohqsg
After performing the $15k (for premier) or $2k (for normal acc) transfer in  how long do I need to wait (few hrs?) before I can transfer out ah?,btohqsg
