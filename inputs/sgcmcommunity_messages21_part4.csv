I know some of us promote Tesla endlessly and I don’t disagree they are good for what they do. here is the full picture said by the man himself :https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-tech%2C-development-and-manufacturing/tesla-could-stop-taking-orders-over-supply,btohqsg

Production and supply chain issues to cope just say it as it is by the man.,btohqsg
All companies have supply chain issues but if they cannot deliver  they stop taking orders such as Porsche did as they had to shut down their factories due to wire loom shortages. The others have longer lead times also but they are still able to launch new models and deliver those while some companies have launched a Truck  Sports car and new variants of their sedan and SUV which they are not able to deliver in time and keep pushing year by year,btohqsg
Even tyre is hard to get for t0,btohqsg

@winman16@lawryyyyI don’t think there’s any manual EV available in Singapore…,btohqsg
Actually if not for the hoggers on the overtaking lane going parallel with lane 2 and not giving way  no one will need to tailgate 😏,btohqsg
Toyota is developing a way of giving you a manual shifter in an EV and curbing power delivery upon gear changes to make you feel like you are shifting but actually no shifts,btohqsg
Wow so my wild guess is real. In fact I don’t even know,btohqsg
Currently only the Audi e-tron gt and Porsche taycan have multiple gear transmissions with 2 gears,btohqsg
“Feel like shifting but actually no shift”?,btohqsg
All the others are single drive,btohqsg
Yes Taycan has 2 speed box,btohqsg
Soon bmw will do fake exhaust in order to do more sales,btohqsg
There's also a manual gearbox offered by Hyundai and Kia for ICE cars with no clutch. It's known as an iMT and sold in some markets in South Asia and Africa,btohqsg
Hydraulic actuator clutch. Just no pedal,btohqsg
Something like that for the pure ICE cars,btohqsg
