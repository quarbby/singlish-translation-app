you sure you driving mazda and m3 not porsche ah bro? your definition of redline seems a bit high,btohqsg
higher. it wants you to do high. anything at 5000+ is kinda common.,btohqsg
mazda 3 or bmw m3 damn big difference,btohqsg
e30 good too hor don’t play play dtm legend ah sia,btohqsg

that is why i dont want to drive it often. only once a week,btohqsg
uh  I think need to visit a different workshop already if your rpm is 5000 common when driving in auto,btohqsg
wow that’s a funny joke haha,btohqsg
I will pray for your engine and gearbox,btohqsg
go ahead with your naivety #2,btohqsg
shows you dont know cars high performance machines,btohqsg
you mean doing5000-6000rpms will destroy engine? sure if oil is not hot!,btohqsg
maybe those honda type r at 8000+ wont last too,btohqsg
hows your transmission oil going? can sell as slushy to 7-11?,btohqsg
i will tell you - i blast my 1990 e30 at6200-6000rpm redline since 1990! and it is as good as ever! it cannot be better and it is great,btohqsg
and i can show you the internals what it looks like when open,btohqsg
the camshafts  the pistons  the rod bearings etc,btohqsg
the key is good oil and not about high revv... the engine loves to revv high,btohqsg
when oil is good and hot  it is safe to revv high to redline.,btohqsg
thanks for your recommendation  will not change transmission oil till my coe end,btohqsg
