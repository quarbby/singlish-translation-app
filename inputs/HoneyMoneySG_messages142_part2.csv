Anyone participated in citigold NTB promo before? I'm wondering if shares transfer in from cdp will be considered as part of the AUM? T&Cs mentioned investments only refer to investment distributed by Citibank  so likely the AUM for NTB needs to be in the form of fresh fund in cash. But after promo period  not sure if I can maintain my AUM solely from the shares transfer in?,btohqsg
