Made in China has a bad conotation of poor build quality or quality control of a car. eg. Tesla. I have seen Teslas that are made in US and made in China and i dare say those made in China's Gigafactory have far superior quality control over those made in US. Panel gaps are much better etc,btohqsg

This one is a porsche design from VW parts bin. Only 924S uses Porsche engine.,btohqsg
This is with 944 Body Kit.Good thing about this is that 924 Turbo is rare.But for a turbo without intercooler  it is bound to have problems.... XD,btohqsg
funny thing is that its is a van engineðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Technically true  but with a porsche designed heads.,btohqsg
You could say the Mercs 190E 2.3 and 2.3 16V are the same engine (block) but a different head.,btohqsg
Likewise Mitsubishi Starion and Mitsubishi Evo also,btohqsg
