Recap on Asiatic:Back in Jan 2021   NEO garden boss became SSH  taking 12% of Asiatic through married deal at $0.008.Unfortunately  the counter have slided down in the past year and is now trading at $0.005/$0.006.Note:1) there was a decent size married deal recent at $0.0062) just recently  single buyer spotted at $0.005   qing and buy 10 000 000 shares at this price too.From the looks of it  they should be forming the base here at $0.005./$0.006 Once  they have collected enough  and the right micro sentiments kick in  I believe they would start their reversal. Until then  $0.005 would be a price to try to average in  for those stucked higher.DYODDSource:The Edge Singapore | Neo Group's chairman and wife take stake in Asiatic from Tai Sin's Limshttps://www.theedgesingapore.com/capital/insider-moves/neo-groups-chairman-and-wife-take-stake-asiatic-tai-sins-lims,btohqsg

Asiatic OBV maintaining at high whilst liquidity have dropped and price moved down with ease. Looks like they flushing out retailers first. Which explains the recent married deal at $0.006 and big single buyer collecting 10mil shares at $0.005. MPS: Recent marriage Alliance (asiatic boss son married jumbo boss daughter) with Jumbo group might boost Asiatic in certain ways too I reckon. Perhaps some invest in in-laws listed co  vice versa?,btohqsg
As per our expectations  Fed lift rates and mkt already cater in . NASDAQ raised e most closed +3.77%.. Fed projection 06mores rate hikes this year 2022..  suggest it shalln't b too high concerns as mid term our mkt is positive.. (cheong ah financial sectorðŸ¤­),btohqsg
MPMðŸš¤ consolidating price range27 to 31.. can MPMðŸš¤ BO multiple test R 31 ðŸ”œ?,btohqsg
Bro  How about samudera? Is it consolidating at current price range?,btohqsg
Asiatic core businesses are in Energy and Fire Protection. (Both recession proof type of industry)FYI  Their brand of Fire Extinguisher ðŸ§¯ is KillFire and they have been selling a lot in the past few years too. Can observe when u are walking around malls etc.NAV : $0.015No debt based on information provided in POEMS.With a big willing buyer in Neo Kah Kiat buying at $0.008  holding more than 12%.One can wonder what plans he have for Asiatic ? Anyways  it is always a guess-game.My speculation is that he would have some plans for this decisions . Perhaps time will tell.,btohqsg
Bro yong  r u referring Samudera Shipping tat fire a missileðŸš€ fr. 55c to 80c two wks ago?If yes  I saw a bull flag.,btohqsg
Bro  yes  samudera shipping  I saw it been consolidated around 0.75-0.76  0.735 strong support,btohqsg
If Neo garden boss is buying $0.008  buying below him at $0.005 makes it less scary.Ultimately  if he wants to make $ ROI  he needs to engineer a play.Trading plan:Collect $0.005 with whoever is collecting and wait it out.,btohqsg
