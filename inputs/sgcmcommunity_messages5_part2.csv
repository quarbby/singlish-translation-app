Yes sr  cause u handsome and suave.,btohqsg
Hello  i am planning to buy my 1st car  any suggestion? Probably looking for cheap COE car for first time  what do i need to look out for?,btohqsg
the best time to buy a car is during restriction period,btohqsg
now depreciation even for COE car is very high,btohqsg
What are u looking out for in the car?,btohqsg
What will be ur usage like,btohqsg
Nothing special just make sure i can go frok point a to b. So not need a fancy car. As long the car is in good condition.,btohqsg
Probably will buy second hand car for now. Until i feel comfortable before spending more.. ahaha.. maybe fit or swift,btohqsg
Fit is a good idea. Can consider Vios or Axio very save fuel =D,btohqsg
fit is my preferred car  agile  easy to drive  and park  good fc  cheap to maintain,btohqsg
you should test drive a fit and a vios  for me fit is the obvious choice,btohqsg
Fit can be a good camper cause of the interior seats flexibility as well,btohqsg
Recommended coilover & suspension brands for better car handlingWhich is your preferred aftermarket coilover?🤔👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you are using aftermarket coilovers!➡️ Click here to find outmore,btohqsg
Toyota and Honda insurance is cheaper too,btohqsg
My friend selling Jazz  left 3 years. Let me know if you are keen.Parf car  only 60 k km,btohqsg
Wa very under utilized good deal if can get =D,btohqsg
he never say how much yet how u know good deal,btohqsg
Let's try and guess how much the price will be,btohqsg
buy a used one. a good used one,btohqsg
As in the car only move 60k milleage for a 7yrs car.,btohqsg
COE IS250  2009 onwards model. very good looking and totally bulletproof,btohqsg
buy a used mazda 6 or 3 great to drive and reliable,btohqsg
Owner could be expecting a high price also since he/she feels mileage is Low,btohqsg
having said that i think its fair that a car with such low mileage at that age ask for a little more than market rate,btohqsg
the peace of mind is quite worthwhile,btohqsg
Depends on how the car was maintained also,btohqsg
Not very worth in SG context i believe. Knowing that after that u need to renew COE for another how much and the car isnt even new ><,btohqsg
yeah for sure. but all things constant  lower mileage is better,btohqsg
my own observation (opinion only  not fact) is that those i know who dont drive often tend to take better care of their cars. They over-service the cars relative to mileage and their interiors are much less worn out. so to me  lower mileage is a really good sign,btohqsg
Same recommendation… but I drive mazda  so im pro mazda,btohqsg
buy used cars can trust the mileage 1?,btohqsg
you can cross check with servicing records from agent if there are any,btohqsg
unless got official servicing receipt since day 1 noting the mileage.. otherwise just take it its not real better,btohqsg
yeah if direct seller gt keep best,btohqsg
single owner with full service record and low mileage. i happily pay 10-20% over market price for this kind of car,btohqsg
Different people uses car for different purposes.Workhorses are usually not taken care of.,btohqsg
yup and the workhorses are the ones with the high mileage,btohqsg
sorry  dont mean to offend anyone,btohqsg
left 1 year COE still not that bad.,btohqsg
would have to be really cheap i guess,btohqsg
Sharing is caring. Opinions and Thoughts are welcomed =D,btohqsg
yea. My experience with Toyota workhorses are that if minimally maintained  engine can last longer than the power windows,btohqsg
These cars have very high depre!,btohqsg
oh yea yesterday big rain. Saw one mazda (i believe I saw PTE HIRE label) with spare tires on front right side.Damn dangerous. I will never take that ride,btohqsg
i know a good friend of mine. i promise you i am not joking. he bought a new toyota vios i thin in 2008. he just drove it from new and NEVER SERVICED IT. he never changed the oil. the car lasted 80 000 EIGHTY THOUSAND KM before it blew. You know what the repair bill was? 2k plus. i joked to him that he actually saved money not changing the oil for about 3-4 years and just repairing the blown engine,btohqsg
"left 1 year... its the ""spoil but replace now not worth"" period",btohqsg
so dun wanna repair. sell car lo hahahaha,btohqsg
yup. Car can move can liao,btohqsg
When people buy 2nd hand car. Even when the SE says the car already did check and all inspections. Will U guys still go ahead and change the Spark Plugs Etc?,btohqsg
depends. If you are willing to spend  go ahead of change the spark plugs. The don't cost much.,btohqsg
