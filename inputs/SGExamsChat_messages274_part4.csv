There ‚Äòs a scene of him acting like one..,btohqsg
liking to listen to anime opening / game songs / ads songs,btohqsg
English is like all abt luv,btohqsg
how long i didn't listen to tat alr lol,btohqsg
"its called ""stay""  with The Kid LAROI",btohqsg
id do the same that i tell you i never would,btohqsg
why are there so many ppl in grps of,btohqsg
I think their taste is the Gold 90.5FM and Class 95 kind of playlist.,btohqsg
Guys how to stop smell of cig from neighbour,btohqsg
Chinese paper got distinctive smell cuz I live near a temple,btohqsg
I think my parents talk to them befote but like they still do it,btohqsg
my throat feels so dry from all the smoke,btohqsg
Been living with this shit for years,btohqsg
unless it's sore throat from covid,btohqsg
My neighbour ‚Äòs dog bark 3 times a day or more without fail..,btohqsg
Well. I tried to. But sometimes it barks at 11pm+,btohqsg
Wrong small dog = easier to take care of,btohqsg
Except that my definition of take care of is most likely different from what you're thinking,btohqsg
where to buy  how to install,btohqsg
I put like at my window,btohqsg
Cannot uh.. The whole house can hear the bark so not just one room.,btohqsg
I dw expose where I stay,btohqsg
I know there ‚Äòs two dogs that barks very loudly. One on level 1 and the other on the second floor.,btohqsg
Then they tell me is another estate..,btohqsg
I got asked the dog on level 2 to shut up before..,btohqsg
I shouted at the dog from level 1,btohqsg
Well  most people here are only on Pop & K-pop so yeah.,btohqsg
That's a good question since After Hours is labeled as Alternative R&B but it was considerably the most popular R&B album of 2020,btohqsg
That's the norm after all. Sometimes it is quite detrimental  Chance The Rapper.,btohqsg
Bille did make a big impact here,btohqsg
Can I say that I actually like Changes now?,btohqsg
I play old racing games so we we're all weird in our ways,btohqsg
Well  not true really  The Weeknd used to be about mindless groupie sex while living a hedonistic drug-filled lifestyle,btohqsg
I was thinking more along the lines of kanye's graduation  considered alternative hip hop  beating 50 cent's curtis  a gangsta rap album  considered one of the most popular hip hop genres at the time,btohqsg
His older songs sound like high on drugs..,btohqsg
To be fair people's tastes change over time,btohqsg
I didn't like Taylor until Folklore & Evermore,btohqsg
They forgot that today is the 8th  maybe,btohqsg
Well  that's back on '07 & Hip-Hop was starting to move away from bling-era then.,btohqsg
Yes  I used to listen to Maroon V back then and whatever is popping on the radio but now I'm considered (in my surroundings) the odd one out since I listen to the Weeknd Silk Sonic & Tyler  The Creator (obviously there is more but I'm just stating artists that have dropped new materials this year),btohqsg
@sactiiii&@raznflame  The Weeknd is really taking my breath away.,btohqsg
The maturity of him not wanting to the drug lifestyle anymore (reflected in the lyrics) and the continuation of the sounds from After Hours is really something,btohqsg
I feel like we might be getting an album of him being the anti-thesis of House of Balloons,btohqsg
