Does amaze charge 2% if it is a linked payment card for grab trip? Didn‚Äôt find any clear answer as mostly reply charge for top up.,btohqsg
Scb Manhattan is still the best for hospitals. But no new applicants already.,btohqsg
Mostly talk on top up  grab pay‚Ä¶linked payment method  charges directly to the card  so deciding if can link to amaze?,btohqsg
Is grab trip a wallet Topup? Or a card spend?,btohqsg
Not inside then safe to say not chargeable transaction,btohqsg
Any reason why need to link Amaze to Grab trip instead of linking to the credit card directly? Which credit card you want link Amaze it?,btohqsg
My guess is also not chargeable,btohqsg
Using amaze to link up to 4 credit cards,btohqsg
Then your miles will be spread across 4 cards n pay more miles conversion fee?,btohqsg
Have not use uob absolute for a year  last mth use one time for Snack  yesterday kanna one pending fraud transaction.. üò°,btohqsg
Guys which card to link for grabpay ? Am using uob absolute nowAlso if uob one account and ocbc 360 account both 100k already   then where else is good for next high interest ?,btohqsg
There were already numerous reports on snack n fraud transactions last 1-2 weeks. Surprise you still did it yesterday.,btohqsg
Easy way is to add all your 4 cards to Grab apps n tap the red circle n choose the card you wish to use.,btohqsg
Grab taxi the best card to use is uob one for 10% cash rebate,btohqsg
ohhh.. i also had a fraud transaction on my absolute card.. so it was from SNACK...,btohqsg
No it is not. Got dps from people with no snack also got fraud.Don‚Äôt anyhow blame snack.It is uob absolute bin numbers kenna mass brute force hack by hackers,btohqsg
Non-snack users also reported fraudulent transactions on their UOB cards  so it‚Äôs probably a BIN attack on UOB cards,btohqsg
Similarly like u  I have not used my uob absolute card for abt a year  also kena fraudulent transaction. But is not cos of snack  I have no activity in this card until this ie fraud trans happened to me.,btohqsg
Unfortunately there‚Äôs no good way to guard against such brute force attacks (short of locking all your cards when not in use  which may be impractical for some)  so u just have to be vigilant and look out for such fraudulent transactions and report to the bank as soon as u spotted one.,btohqsg
Whats brute force attacks ?Uob fraud hotline staff mentioned scammers used sophis ated software and auto gen the 16 digits that happened to be in sync with ur credit card number. That‚Äôs one possible reasons. This is not the first time I had fraudulent transaction but is a debit card with uob too  also a card that i didnt use for debit transaction for a year except that it has atm function too. And that is in last Aug,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing. I am using UOB lady‚Äôs card (in amaze) for transport (petrol) to earn miles.,btohqsg
Any miles card that gives rewards on insurance spending?,btohqsg
Uob lady card quota is only $3k per month and I think unleashed from approx June 2023 to feb 2024 only.9 months to spend $3k. So I would choose a category that can make the most hay and to me thats travel.Since petrol and grab can easily use other cards to earn similar or even more value than 6mpd I‚Äôll won‚Äôt use uob lady transport category.No right no wrong all dependent on your use case.For me I use uob lady 6mpd on categories where I cannot achieve 6mpd with other cards.,btohqsg
Brute force attack is basically a program with library of 100-200 common password. It will try every combination to get in anyone's account.,btohqsg
Guys which card to link for grabpay ? Am using uob absolute nowAlso if uob one account and ocbc 360 account both 100k already   then where else is good for next high interest ?,btohqsg
Only uob absolute still give 0.3 cashback,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like what the UOB staff mentioned to u. Basically scammers try many combinations of credit card numbers till they hit one that works.,btohqsg
Okay I see. Set manage alerts to 0.01 via the banking portal. So one receive the alert via an sms and quickly block the cc before scammers can chg on one‚Äôs card,btohqsg
You can use multiple keywords to search chat history  it gives you better result.Eg. ‚ÄúInsurance card‚Äù‚ÄúInsurance card miles‚Äù‚ÄúInsurance cashback‚Äù,btohqsg
Will need uob digital token fyi,btohqsg
Hi guys. Can I ask about overseas spend cardsToday I guess would be value for rebates Instarem Amaze? Since got 2%?For Amaze which is better to use? Card link or Wallet?I don't really know the details but I belive card link lower exchange rates but got points?(I don't have a Miles card but have simple HSBC Advanced 1.5% & Citi CashBack+ 1.6%)Please advise üôèüèª,btohqsg
Quick qn  I linked my citi rewards with amaze to pay for outpatient specialist over the counter does this still consider as eligible online transaction to earn the 10x point?,btohqsg
My feel is always link to high reward credit card.Wallet Topup no rewards although better fx rate and earn more amaze points. But still can‚Äôt win linked to 4-6mpd or 8% cashback cards,btohqsg
Want to compare if it would be worth while using card link with low exchange rates.Only have 2  1.5% cashback cards. Instagram 2% (upsized today) in points. Would it still be a positive vs using wallet top ups or other cards like Youtrip or Trust with no rebates right?,btohqsg
Cpf app can top up MA or only through website?,btohqsg
My HR credits salary via paynow NRIC. Does that fufill SC's Giro requirement?,btohqsg
No not worth it if u link 1.5% cashback cards,btohqsg
I think only SC can answer your question.,btohqsg
Using Wallet for Instargram Amaze still will get some Amaze points right?So Amaze better than Youtrip  Trust  Revoult in this sense?,btohqsg
Yep main hq and all the founders are malaysia,btohqsg
better thn youtrip to use in korea or japan?,btohqsg
Should be the rates are super competitive,btohqsg
oct 23 got a nerf that results in 1% transaction fee for hospitals  not sure if it affects your outpatient spending,btohqsg
Hi cpf experts. Recently I have an extra lump of cash proceeds from my previous home sale.May I know what are the factors I shd consider whether I shd use this lump sum to clear my cpf sum that i paid for my current home  or shd I continue to use my cpf for the mortage?How shd I decide?,btohqsg
Current FD rates higher than CPF interest rates. I feel it makes sense to put it in FD rather than do CPF housing loan repayment. Though I think interest rate may come down soon.,btohqsg
Valid option but as earlier reply states  outlook on interest rates is that it won't stay as high  and tbills only lasts for 6/12 mths.Might be better overall to lock in a longer term deposit despite the lower interest rate.,btohqsg
So the problem is uob absolute card only. And not snack correct?,btohqsg
Cso told me there are quite few txn to my card but one managed to go through üôè,btohqsg
hi all  if i use amaze + miles card for overseas spend  would it still be overall more savings from getting the miles than using a youtrip/wise card that charges lesser fx fees?,btohqsg
Only if u value miles positively.You trip has no rewards but good rateAmaze + credit card or direct credit card u pay 2-4% fx fees but u earn rewards.,btohqsg
