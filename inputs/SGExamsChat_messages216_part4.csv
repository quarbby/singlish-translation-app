hi anyone know how do split,btohqsg
got that leg split thingy lor,btohqsg
Last time my male school friend  fell and did a split he tore his shorts. And it happened he did not wear his underwear that day.,btohqsg
I can do the side splits. Centre splits still working on it. Started training for it during my time in school. I took up dance in primary and secondary school. I would say rather than how to do  it would be consistent stretching and practice to progress closer to perfect splits.,btohqsg
There is lots of tutorials available on youtube to master splits.,btohqsg
