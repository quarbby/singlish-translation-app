Lip service. That's why when they talk about any initiatives is for u to do. Not for them,btohqsg
Like yellow ribbon. U hire not them. Like reduce carbon footprint. U take public transport. They own 2 cars.,btohqsg
They have to do something for people to see. Anything else  bo their tai ji liao,btohqsg
Just like the recycling initiative...they make it machiam very big and important...save the earth...it's all crap de at the end of the day.,btohqsg
