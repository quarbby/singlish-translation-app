Btw why japan fav against serbia wtf,btohqsg
I don't think Japan will win,btohqsg
Because they still got last game in qualifiers they may just use it as a training match and let their reserves play,btohqsg
Ya that's what I think too,btohqsg
So that their reserves can play the last game against Kyrgyzstan,btohqsg
They alr qualified I think. No pt risking injury to players,btohqsg
I gonna try serbia win small,btohqsg
But I bet draw. Maybe I hedge with Serbia win,btohqsg
