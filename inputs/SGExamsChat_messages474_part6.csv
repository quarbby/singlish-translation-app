yea but you adjust how much you pay per month based on your needs,btohqsg
i can survive with 600 a month now,btohqsg
but i saw on the news they give very flexible working hrs,btohqsg
so i save a bit then rest throw to dbs,btohqsg
but if i work two odd jobs + study,btohqsg
Actually more and more common poly keeds are working part-time,btohqsg
im just hoping i can pay off some loans and hall fees,btohqsg
or at minimum pay off hall fees so i can just pay off tuition debt after grad,btohqsg
actly idk if i wanna stay in hall,btohqsg
Depends if distance is an issue,btohqsg
And also whether you want hall culture,btohqsg
not bad leh. When I first graduated I needed average $900 monthly,btohqsg
Uni life? I need to study,btohqsg
yea but tbf i still in ntu so canteen food prices,btohqsg
Ok lah I don't do those,btohqsg
only dip into more for like celebrations,btohqsg
u can dont study ah just drop out oni,btohqsg
I don't even turn up on campus unless I gotta,btohqsg
i’m probs staying hall next sem just for mental health reasons lol,btohqsg
If got meet the parents session for uni my prof sure dunno got this student,btohqsg
I'm that type go campus make full use of the facilities since I'm paying for it,btohqsg
trying to see if i can be a graduate hall mentor meaning my hall fees can get cut by 60%,btohqsg
I need to travel to use the facility so that's money tooo,btohqsg
n then theres me where my prof calls my name to ask if i got A again,btohqsg
But ya I tend to stay in school and study if I already on campus,btohqsg
I delayed getting a smartphone until iPhone 4S came out,btohqsg
i might build my pc and station it in my ntu office,btohqsg
Actually just sleep in phd office,btohqsg
I see people bring hugeass soft toy,btohqsg
esp if i end up in ntu,btohqsg
ntu 2 1/2-3 hrs per trip,btohqsg
NTU is far for almost anyone tbh,btohqsg
I actively track all expenses because I went all out to scrimp and save every single thing,btohqsg
so in total i’ll be spending 5-6hrs on travelling alone,btohqsg
yea but rn the problem is traveling  so if i get hall i can just sleep in hall right,btohqsg
LOL maybe look at some bus alternatives,btohqsg
my office rn has 2 people only including me btw,btohqsg
+ during exams szn i rlly want to avoid having yo travel around,btohqsg
waiting for this other guy to grad,btohqsg
then again if its nus i wld need to take a considerable amt of ccas to retain hall spot uh so,btohqsg
i spent around 200 bucks last month,btohqsg
Feb - March is my poorest time of the year,btohqsg
about there. So when I first graduated  I worked near 80 hrs weekly,btohqsg
i dabao food from home so i can save moolahz,btohqsg
full time engineer + full time tutor at the same time,btohqsg
i wish my contract didn’t restrict me to not taking a secondary job,btohqsg
u calculate wld still be cheaper than like eating out,btohqsg
which is also why i want go nus hall,btohqsg
since they serve breakfast and dinner when u cut around it ure paying around 200-300 bucks for the place itself,btohqsg
traveling to ntu SUCKS when you don’t get concessions like undergrads do,btohqsg
