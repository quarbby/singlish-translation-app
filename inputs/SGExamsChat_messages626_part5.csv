Yea i js regret some stuff not knowing that it works this way,btohqsg
i will fr bow down in respect if you hit that,btohqsg
my 2.4 40minüíÄ cuz i walk the whole way,btohqsg
i mean realistically it doesn‚Äôt matter for you,btohqsg
is ippt which uhh idk for what also,btohqsg
only matters for guys going ns,btohqsg
since my pe is graded satisfactory/unsatisfactory,btohqsg
my 2.4 best was like 14 just nice or smth,btohqsg
rmb my 3.2km run for ndp last yr was just barely over 20 mins lol,btohqsg
then go med come back be MO,btohqsg
I get to see hot guys like yt,btohqsg
idk if I read or heard wrongly but MO don't earn alot right,btohqsg
Girls express fashion: empowering!Guys express fashion: Let‚Äôs make fun of him.,btohqsg
way to take it completely out of context lol,btohqsg
I know you all dont like this Josh but this is the last thing to criticise him for,btohqsg
Idt I've seen u ard b4   are u new?,btohqsg
it's js a very weird reason to choose a certain education pathway over another js because you can grow your hair out in one,btohqsg
also we were talking about how josh is not going to get to wear what he wants and grow his hair long in NS,btohqsg
It'll be funny asf if that person came from disc,btohqsg
i think the possibility is there,btohqsg
don't tell the the person defending josh,btohqsg
What if the person is josh,btohqsg
nah idt josh is that wuliao,btohqsg
I dont think he would be the kind of person to make alts to defend himself,btohqsg
It seems that Josh places significant value on individuality and personal expression  and it is not your business to invalidate him,btohqsg
Maybe it's someone who share similar ideals as josh,btohqsg
how to study h2 organic chem in 5 days,btohqsg
since when did i invalidate him? I was simply making a point that a guy will not get to grow his hair long or wear what he wants while serving as a national serviceman,btohqsg
man if it were me I'd just study wtv I can and just chiong alr,btohqsg
If I were sitting for As,btohqsg
Your initial point was that he chose poly over JC for the greater freedom of expression,btohqsg
Now you‚Äôre redirecting the focus to the NS part?,btohqsg
Please have a look at which message I replied to,btohqsg
so if he chooses poly to grow his hair out hes gonna have to chop it all off when he signs on,btohqsg
im preparing for some comp that‚Äôs in like 5 days ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
and they‚Äôre testing up to a level stuff,btohqsg
And so? You don‚Äôt dress up for it to last forever,btohqsg
I mean there's utube As summary,btohqsg
I just scared information overload for u,btohqsg
and jc/ns is only 2 years so its also not like youll have to follow rules forever,btohqsg
anyw josh probably has other reasons to go poly other than js the long hair,btohqsg
I try run 2.4km every week,btohqsg
we were just pointing out about how its funny to go to poly js because you can express urself a certain way only for that form of self expression to be taken away 3 years later,btohqsg
hey hey no need for such harsh words  as much as freedom of expression goes  let's have mutual respect,btohqsg
u r outnumbered. u btr back down,btohqsg
maybe im acting but you definitely arent ü´®ü´®ü´®,btohqsg
I said that Josh goes to poly so he can express himself more freely for those 3 years. Yes he will have to cut it off during NS  but what truly matters is that he is happy with how he looks during the 3 years itself. He can enjoy it while it lasts.,btohqsg
um idk sorry but shld be after 1feb,btohqsg
no one want talk to you sorry,btohqsg
It's just you have better ways of expressing your thoughtsüòÖ,btohqsg
