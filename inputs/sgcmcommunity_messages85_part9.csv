Hi all! Any recommendations on which insurer to get for car insurance and what to look out for?,btohqsg
Err‚Ä¶cheapest one possible? Most of them are alright. Not sure if there‚Äôs one to avoid (perhaps someone else can weigh in). But make sure the coverage is what you need  whether it‚Äôs only 3rd party damage or comprehensive and the other thing to consider is if the coverage is for own workshop or appointed workshops only. The latter is purely preference.,btohqsg
