she actually spent 1k on a perm,btohqsg
She saved up that 1k herself?,btohqsg
even if she saved it it doesnt make a difference 1k on a perm is wild,btohqsg
I mean if she paid for it herself then it's her life ah,btohqsg
thats fair but it just reflects poor finance management,btohqsg
But as I get older  I tend to disrespect anyone who don't gain anything by their own means,btohqsg
The question becomes why do we need to care? Why must we label her as such?,btohqsg
