uni people will vape as they stroll around campus,btohqsg
Yes vaping is a bad decision but its not appropriate to call an entire group of ppl stupid based on the actions of a small minority group,btohqsg
my term of stupid is not that they r intelligently challneged,btohqsg
Need butt head w some of them,btohqsg

Its js something ive been thinking about,btohqsg
like for example some ppl say that its racist to not wanna date outside your race,btohqsg
i love all races (except black ones),btohqsg
"i mean i personally do have some ""prereqs"" when looking for a partner",btohqsg
but some of them ill nvr say them publicly,btohqsg
"personally i think dating is one of the areas where you should be as selective and ""discriminatory"" as you wish since you're looking for a companion  not farming diversity points",btohqsg
I feel like racism is constantly being redefined,btohqsg
i do not want to go there,btohqsg

Hello random qn to ppl/musicians/pianists  can I ask those who owned an electronic keyboard before like how long did it last for u,btohqsg
i owned and still own one,btohqsg
I googled and it normally last 5-10 years only give or take,btohqsg
mine has been around for 5 years but i also own an upright piano,btohqsg
keyboard was mostly when in uni the jam band,btohqsg
how long an electric keyboard lasts depends on what kind it is,btohqsg
there’s a v big diff in quality across,btohqsg
Oh what abt Yamaha ones if u owned it b4,btohqsg
most usual brands like yamaha  kawai  korg are quite solid so it depends on higher end vs lower end  what features  what you’re using it for,btohqsg
if take care properly it’s usually more of time to upgrade than it broke completely,btohqsg
Ooooo icic by upgrade   do u mean switch to a more current/up to date version?,btohqsg
no more of if you’re at a level that a keyboard that has better sound quality  build  features would suit you better,btohqsg
like if i play badminton i start out with a beginner racket then if i take it more seriously ill get a more advanced one,btohqsg
if her body count is quite low means she hasn’t killed anybody yet,btohqsg
🖼 🎓 Ready to ace your university application?Hey guys  some of you may know me asKoufason Reddit. Over the past 4 years  I have been answering questions on r/SGExams and r/SMU_Singapore pertaining to early careers & internships  (particularly in Economics & Finance)  university applications  and university lifeSome friends and I are hosting a Zoom conversation / QnA on questions recent A Level & Poly grads might have before applying to university the next cycle. This includes how to select your university course  how to think about your application process  how to look for internships  sources of funding for university  local vs overseas unis  etcWe will have grads / seniors from different universities in SG & overseas  depending on the response for thisIf you have super specific questions on a university course we aren't able to answer  we will try to find people who canSign-up Link:https://forms.gle/qxSjKPEoYRkxJEfi6Cheers  happy holidays,btohqsg
btw this reminded me fcp bangs ppl table if they sleep in class apparently,btohqsg
she also move this girl who always sleep in class to the front and always call on her to answer qns,btohqsg
until that time she said she’d ignore me from then on,btohqsg
then i can sleep the whole class 👍,btohqsg
a w is a w 🔥,btohqsg
"some teachers dont even care at y4 they just be like ""oh ur education is ur own responsibility  js dont disrupt others who want to learn  not my fault if you cant promote""",btohqsg
i mean they’re not wrong but also a lot of teens don’t see the importance until much later on lol,btohqsg
i love these kind of teachers,btohqsg
They dont give a fuck abt ppl who dont want to give a fuck and actually focus on ppl who want to be better,btohqsg
jc teachers in my school seem q chill,btohqsg
sec sch chers most q chill also,btohqsg
I feel pri sch are some of the worst,btohqsg
pri sch teachers need to know how to keep order,btohqsg
most ppl in my sch q chill incl discipline master,btohqsg
I still rmb how my pri sch chinese teacher showed the whole class what i write for chi spelling,btohqsg
i'll be doing an internship at a pri sch in jan,btohqsg
Side note i did jack shit for it,btohqsg
I feel easier to teach sec sch kids,btohqsg
have to reach at 715am every morning and the sch a bit far from my house lol,btohqsg
Coz at least they give a fk abt studies,btohqsg
some pri sch kids can be very guai and cute sit there and do their work quietly,btohqsg
then some sec sch yps literally keesiao in class everyday,btohqsg
Pri sch topics easier to teach  but harder to explain why things are the way they are,btohqsg
Like why apple is pronounced as apple,btohqsg
you need to explain stuff in the very simple terms,btohqsg
and i think thats actl like super cool that ppl can do that,btohqsg
Pri sch need be more creativr  sec sch u just tell them x+y=z,btohqsg
cause jc kids are more mature and for jc js teach subj material,btohqsg
but sec sch and pri sch maybe the kids need more guidance,btohqsg
You reminded me of my GP Cher who said she taught pri sec and JC before and she prefer to teach at JC,btohqsg
plus hor  I like to chat about after JC life with students,btohqsg
Sec 1s are p6 but 1 year older,btohqsg
The reason my Cher gave is exactly that,btohqsg
Therefore they have arnd the same psychology,btohqsg
Sec 2s are p6 but 2 years older so also arnd the same psychology,btohqsg
Then in sec 3 the workload slaps their psychology,btohqsg
Actl is sec3 workload that much more than lower sec,btohqsg
My pri sch ss teacher made it into the headlines,btohqsg
Called one of her students 'retarded monkeys',btohqsg
My friend had to booked in for guard duty tdy,btohqsg
My j1 gp teacher left to teach kindergarteners,btohqsg
U must understand they are from the era that their teachers whack them and fk them up badly,btohqsg
My pri sch senior share w us that his eng teacher will throw his home work from lvl 4 to lvl 1,btohqsg
And that was the norm in early 2000s,btohqsg
Pretty sure shit was way worst back then,btohqsg
Personally saw how one old school teacher lost his shit and ask one of my classmate to drop 20. This was in sec 1 or sec 2( cant rmb ),btohqsg
I got caught playing phone in sch toilet  discipline master asked me stand behind podium during morning assembly when he talks,btohqsg
he is those teacher that u see in sec sch that come n teach for one term den zao,btohqsg
Quite common for jc grad to do that sia,btohqsg
i think its more of js helping the teachers w stuff,btohqsg
