Hi all just a dumb questionfor uob one visa credit card the minimum spend of $500is it on all transaction? or only eligible merchant ?example if i spend $500 on M1 Bill payment - no additional cash backbut is it considered as a 500 dollars spend?,btohqsg
You’ll get cash back if it’s considered a $500 spend,btohqsg
on transactions that are not excluded. Refer to TnC for exclusion list,btohqsg

I’m interested to sign up CIMB credit card through Singsaver for the $330 upsized cashback but this flash deal is expiring on 2 April 2023. I wonder if I’m still able to get the cashback if I submit the online application on the last day. Anyone tried before? Should I apply today? Thanks.,btohqsg
Yea it’s a sign that the card approved  you will need this number to sign up for online banking account for your credit cardCIMB doesn’t send email/SMS to say your credit card approved. My guess is you will see the physical card in a mail soon enufCheers,btohqsg
yes and use Amaze card for transactions that is not excluded as per TnC of citi rewards,btohqsg
Yes  apply before tonight 23:59H is still eligiblehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/80238,btohqsg
In gomo app  how can i setup the payment to get 4mpd using citi reward card?,btohqsg
Just a note. Need to be patient for their sign up rewards to be credited. I signed up in Oct  met the min spent in Nov. Got the sign up rewards only in Mar.,btohqsg
Hi all  I just signed up the following credit cards through Singsaver and got approved lately.OCBC Titanium Rewards $228 CashMin spend $500 within 30 daysCiti Rewards $300 CashMin spend $500 within 30 daysCIMB Visa Signature $330 CashMin spend $988 within 60 daysBut then I realised that I need to spend $1500 in order to get the cashback. I usually spend only $500 a month and I find it difficult for me to spend another $1000. Is there any tips to meet the min spend for each card? Is topping up to FairPrice Gift Card and advance bill payment to Telco (Singtel app/online) considered as eligible spend for these cards? Thanks in advance! 🙏,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Time to churn and get the 330 CB reward 🙏,btohqsg
It not advisable to sign many cards in the same month. Anyway since done just top up FairPrice gift card,btohqsg
Yea agree with above ^ Citi bank (seen higher rewards) and CIMB rewards quite frequent also  dunnid sign nowSince sign alrd  FairPrice lorAdvance payment to telco should be not eligible spend,btohqsg
Initially I thought that some of my credit card applications will rejected by the bank so I went to apply all at once to try my luck. But then I didn’t know all got approved. 😅,btohqsg
Can I use all 3 of these cards to top up FairPrice Gift Card and eligible for cashback? Or some can some cannot? Is there any other ways or strategies beside FairPrice?,btohqsg
See Chris video here please for your last questionhttps://youtu.be/7HRtDzj4_4QI not sure how the top up works  but if u buy voucher at FairPrice should be considered groceries spending also which is eligible spend  also covered in Chris’ video,btohqsg
Ok  I will watch it later. Thanks for sharing the link!,btohqsg
Wah so many at 1 go.Gotta watch and track the spendings to hit the minimum spend,btohqsg
Does Spotify monthly subscription give Citi points for CRMC when linked to amaze?,btohqsg

Any good all round cashback card to recommend?Current have these  not sure is it the best available in term of higher cashback..Ocbc FrankSC unlimited (simply cash)SC spreeCiti Cashback plusAmex tcbMostly use inOnline shopping (shopee  redmart  steam)Grocery (ntuc)Shopping in storeGrab rideGrab food,btohqsg
Uob one. Citi cashback [or can omit and just buy fairprice voucher at carousell. Now standard rates at 8% discount],btohqsg
I got this as well. There was abit of hiccups but mine was approved within 5 work days or so,btohqsg
I don’t think it’s wise to go all out at once. Doing CIMB only  and once attain minimum spend target  see if there any promos from Maybank / BOC? Let’s see 🙏,btohqsg
depends how much you can spend ? can consider maybank barcelona too,btohqsg
Is SC spree 2% online/mobile Cashback suppose to be good or have other tnc?,btohqsg
Bought too much fairprice voucher. If anyone wanting to buy at 8%discount . Stay in the east. Can msg me.,btohqsg
I think it’s better to split the cashback credit cards into min spend and no min spend. For example  let’s say your OCBC Frank CC  you must spend at least $800 a month to get up to 8~10% cashback for selected categories/merchants  or else you will only get flat 0.3% cashback. If you can’t hit the min spend  then might as well to use other credit cards that give you 1.5~2% cashback with no min spend for your daily expenses.,btohqsg
Does this mean cards like UOB absolute (amex) cannot use on Apple Pay?,btohqsg
Yes. Only AMEX issued AMEX cards can.,btohqsg
Hi guys  for using HSBC EGA to pay for income tax for the 1% GIRO cashback  does that mean if one chooses monthly instalment  one need to generally do the 2k in  5 trx out  in all 12 months  to qualify for the full 1% across the 12 monthly payments in GIRO?,btohqsg
Technically  you need to do it every alternate month. But if you are lazy in remembering which months you need to do  then just do it every month,btohqsg
is there a reason why alternate month is enough? Or do you mean 2k in on odd month and 2k out on even month?,btohqsg
Because each everyday+ eligibility typically is valid for 2 months. If you receive the eligibility sms today  it's valid to the end of the following month.,btohqsg
no need 2K out  can just FAST out 5 x $1 also ok,btohqsg
Oh cool  didn’t know there’s an SMS for these things  looks like a good feedback mechanism,btohqsg
Does the 1% from GIRO come in the following month?,btohqsg
the question is how to use this card to pay income tax?,btohqsg
Hi gurus any idea what’s the best way to pay for hawker QR to maximise CC benefits?,btohqsg
Citi Rewards + FavePay still gives 4mpd even on foodcourt/hawker/coffeeshop food?,btohqsg
Yes  just make sure you link your Citi Rewards card to FavePay directly  not through Apple Pay,btohqsg
Yeah that’s what I’m doing too! But not all hawkers have fav pay 😢,btohqsg
Liquid pay used to be my go to until they only use the PayNow function 😪,btohqsg
LiquidPay has been replaced with xnap,btohqsg
you can use xnap link to Apple/Google Pay to pay by credit card (but for citi rewards unless u have Amaze + Google Pay u can say bye bye to 4mpd),btohqsg
If my spouse has a supplementary card and now wants to be a principal cardholder  will still be considered as new to bank?,btohqsg

actual it is exclude travel MCCs,btohqsg
For online purchases? I have an amount coming up a purchase for digikey in USD,btohqsg
I’m curious. Do we really need to pair CRMC + Amaze to pay hospital bills via HealthHub? Why can’t we use CRMC to pay directly? Any benefit from Amaze?I know that there is a monthly spend for CRCM capped at $1000/mth and WWMC at $2000/mth. What is the next credit card to use for hospital bill amount > $3000?,btohqsg
health hub no need Amaze. OP is asking about paying hospital  Amaze+CRMC work for hospital that cannot be paid via healthhub alsociti smrt if via healthhub,btohqsg
Do you mean paying hospital bill over the counter using Amaze? I didn’t know that they don’t accept CRMC direct. 😅Thanks for your suggestion to use Citi SMRT as the third credit card for paying hospital bill via HealthHub. 🙏,btohqsg
amaze convert to online to get 4mpd on crmc.btw dun think healthhub can split bill,btohqsg
A little blur. What’s the differences below? Both can get 4mpd right?CRMC > HealthHubCRMC > Amaze > HealthHub,btohqsg
hi  gurus. anyone applied for ocbc credit card promotion on moneysmart? i don't see claim form from money smart😂i am afraid I won't get the gift if i miss out the form.,btohqsg
If I use CRMC for online purchase e.g U$5K (current ex rate 1.33) = S$6650 thru Amaze I get 26 600 miles under 4mpd?,btohqsg
CRMC > HealthHub  yesCRMC > Amaze > HealthHub yesCRMC > Hospital counter NoCRMC > Amaze > Hospital counter Yes,btohqsg
no  4mpd capped for $1k spend in statement month,btohqsg
Wow  that’s a very good explanation in details. Now I get it. Thanks a lot!,btohqsg
Ah! Which means use UOB ACB 1.7% still the better choice then,btohqsg
Today top up grab w amex tcb still in time?,btohqsg
can use citi smrt for 5% rebate. Or ocbc titanium if mcc is in whitelist for 4mpd.dun use uob absolute cos the fx fee is much higher than 1.7% rebate,btohqsg
Agree  and can only sign up once  hence the 1% bonus interest on top of the 4.35% is valid for 2 months from sign up month  cap at $300 and on fresh funds from previous month only,btohqsg
Citi I have enough cc Liao. Fx don’t care cos claim company 🫢🫣,btohqsg
Can I just confirm that using 3rd party apps like atome and pay later functions only allows you to reap the rewards on the first out of three payments? Or can I reap rewards out of all three payments if I split the bill,btohqsg
can get everyday+ rewards (1% bonus interest and 1% rebate for hsbc card spend/giro bill payment) every month so long meet the requirements of transfer in $2k/$5k and 5 transactions minimally on alternate months. But of cos the 1% bonus interest is only on incremental average daily balance wrt previous month's.,btohqsg
I think OCBC has extended the credit card sign up promotion till 30 Apr 2023. I’m not very sure but it’s good for those who haven’t sign up yet.,btohqsg
Thanks Trazora  is the alternate month bonus interest of 1% stated in the terms and conditions? I read it and thought it was only for Spend Period of first 2 months of join date only…,btohqsg

Hey for the Citi Rewards + Amaze.Is the correct procedure for online transaction to use it to get the physical Amaze Card and add it to Apple Pay to PayWave / Apple Pay stuff online  and then in the Insterem App  to put the Citi Rewards as the Card to charge to?Also  would FavePay QR Code using Citi rewards card also count towards the 10x rewards?,btohqsg
Amaze cant be added to apple pay  but can google pay.I have not used Favepay with CRMC. But it works with my shopback,btohqsg
I see. So for PayWave at restaurants  the Citi Rewards card won’t be ideal since there’s no 10 x rewards  right? 🤔,btohqsg
Oh wait  I could just use the physical card right,btohqsg
"the ""standard"" practise is once you link CRMC to Amaze  you just leave the CRMC at home and bring your Amaze card out",btohqsg
but but  I need to say something. certain F&B will give special discount to the bills if you using a specific bank CC. However  I have not seen it happening to citi bank personally   I dont dine in restaurants,btohqsg
I see  thanks for that.Another question  does Spotify and online subscriptions like iCloud count all as online purchases?,btohqsg

EGA I park 100k last month,btohqsg
If I top up do I need to sms to reparticipate ?,btohqsg
EGA is 4 month cycle  you can park for 4 months straight or alternate with another account like OCBC 360,btohqsg
just need sms at the start of the 4 month cycle,btohqsg
This month promo different from last month though,btohqsg
I believe is 4.55% or something,btohqsg
yes almost every month has 1 but lesser interest compared to last month,btohqsg
So just top up in will do? They will calculate daily interest credit interest monthly?,btohqsg
You didn't check with the banker there,btohqsg
once you enrolled in EGA  just keep there for the 4 month cycle  and do 2K and FAST out x 5 every 2 months will do,btohqsg
Oh online didn't show how much,btohqsg
last month EGA personal should be around this  normally will suggest download the TnC for the cycle you in to be safe,btohqsg
Anyone knows if Atome 3 parts payment is eligible for cashback on evol?,btohqsg

$1 also ok  but less than $2K will have FBF,btohqsg
So deposit 2k can get how much interest,btohqsg
Hi all. I've enrolled on a Singsaver EGA promotion that ended 31 Jan and lo / behold  I just got set up. So  I'm assuming the promotion is off right? Cos it's not clear promotion ends = for application or for actual opening. Cos I will only receive email 120 to 150 days...,btohqsg
if you enrolled this month with March 0  then you are entitled 4.35% x 4 months  if you topped up 2K and do 5 FAST  additional 1% for everyday+ promo,btohqsg
suggest may check with CSR which promo you are in first..,btohqsg
To be eligible for this Promotion (“Eligible Customer”)  both New and Existing HSBCcustomers who hold an Eligible Account must successfully register by sending an SMS with therelevant info in the following format to 74722 within the Promotional Period:EGA<space>First 9-digit of their Everyday Global Account number (e.g. EGA 123456789),btohqsg

Posted date. It depends on when the merchant or org posted the transaction. Posting date is outside the bank and our control.,btohqsg
One reason is because of bad credit rating as what is said. The other could be we have already many credit facilities. There might be other reasons. Cimb or any bank are not obligated to disclose rejection reasons to customers. Guess the only way is for us to review the below.https://www.creditbureau.com.sg/available-options.html,btohqsg

This one really depends on the merchant. HSBC Revolution should still give 4mpd for most merchants  but if you want 4mpd for all Kris+ purchases your best bet is to link Citi Rewards to Amaze and link Amaze to Google Pay,btohqsg
Kris + payment is from Google pay. Anyone try Kris + with Amaze card from Google pay...where in the back end Amaze is link3$ to Citi rewards. Anyone try this successfully...

You can read up the term and condition on the link below.https://www.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/ocbc-365-credit-cardA “new OCBC Cardmember” refers to any person who (i) currently does not hold an existingOCBC Credit Card  and (ii) has not held an OCBC Credit Card within the last six (6) monthsprior to the commencement of the Promotion. Applicants who had cancelled existing OCBCCredit Card facilities within the last six (6) months prior to the commencement of thePromotion and re-applied for such facilities under the Promotion are not eligible to participatein the Promotion. For the avoidance of doubt  existing supplementary OCBC Credit Cardcardholders who do not hold any OCBC Credit Card as a principal cardholder are eligible toparticipate in the Promotion.If you still have concern you can call OCBC and confirm as well.,btohqsg

No sms for fast x5 but have a sms for joining HSBC EGA promo -=========HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our Mar EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered within the months of DEC22 to FEB23. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.=======Take note you can only participate once every 4 months promo  correct me if I am wrong….,btohqsg
Alright I just joined the ega promo for this month,btohqsg
So I just need to park my money there for 4 months then withdraw in 1 August ? To reset my balance to 0 then join again in September… not sure about the once every 4 months part,btohqsg
My view - With the fluid interest rates situation  we just have to wait and see how things go after 4 months,btohqsg
But likely interest rates will stay higher for longer. However  the banks’ offers are dependent on their liquidity requirements,btohqsg
For those who applied for Webull SG account last month  check again if your account is approved now. You will still get the same promo by depositing any amount and get your free lucky spins.,btohqsg
There is no spend and balance option in my apps.Are you using Android?I am using iOS.,btohqsg
I got the SMS for Everyday+ btw. But I got it approx 4 days after meeting the transaction requirements.,btohqsg
If it doesn't show  it simply means you have not crossed the 85/90% of the 30k yet  as mentioned by some bros previously. Only when u cross that limit  the spend/balance option will appear in the app.,btohqsg
Hellos can someone help me to advise on the best credit card for high earners.

Any others for me to see see.  Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Best credit card is based on your lifestyle.U can try Prestige  Vantage  VoyageAlso AMEX Platinum if you can,btohqsg
This best CC for high earners doesn’t make sense. Rebates are in cashback or miles/points,btohqsg
Yeah  so actually more like best CC for a particular lifestyle. above 120k  the cc earn rate isnt that high  compared to those 4mpd cards  but it comes with other perks. So question is really what type of lifestyle do you have.Also note that the annual fee for these cards usually cannot be waived and are quite high.,btohqsg
Anyone had experience of Atome refund declined in InstaRem?How did you resolve it?,btohqsg

Citi prestige only if you travel and stay in hotel 4 days to unlock the perks.. which I didn’t so cancelled it after a year,btohqsg

Those 120k cards are not worth in the miles game. Can't beat those 4mpd. Most of it can't waive annual fee. Not worth to get imo unless going after the perks which has got nothing to do with miles game alr.,btohqsg
120k cards are mostly for airport lounge privileges and some other perks mainly..,btohqsg
I will think vantage and prestige will be a good addition . Due to the free lounge visit ( vantage 10 visit   prestige infinite 1+1) . As for fee   depending on your usage . Vantage have free waiver if you spend 60k a year on the card   not sure about prestige,btohqsg
Depend on your usage and how you use it though . Like for example I have monthly rent that I need to pay   with cardup after 1.79% fee   I still get 0.011 cpm which is decent,btohqsg

Guys  how do you manage 2 bank account? Can share some tips plsI am currently using Dbs multiplier and thinking to apply this,btohqsg
what do you mean manage? there's not much to manage usually. For accounts that you won't be using much (mostly parking money there) set all transaction limits to minimum via ibanking so at least if anything happens more likely you'll notice. Occasionally check account transactions  maybe 1-2 times a month  take a min or two to quickly login and browse thruFor important dates like when the EGA promo ends for your account  set something like a google calendar reminder,btohqsg
I just activated my new card replacement and realised i can't add into the amaze app .anyone with same issue ? For citibank reward card,btohqsg

it classifed under simplyGo as 4111 which it not been whitelisted by HSBC Revolution hence no 10x,btohqsg
But if I apply under Singsaver previously  does it counts as qualifying spends,btohqsg
it qualifying spend for Singsaver promo but you won’t earn the bonus reward  only base by the credit card,btohqsg
like HSBC Revolution you will only earn 1x Reward  compared to 10x on whitelisted MCC,btohqsg
Why $2k? Is that the minimum? The higher the deposit  the higher will be the interest we get right?,btohqsg

Ohh I see... So if I put money on 6th April  when does the interest come in? End of month or 1 month after I put the money in haha,btohqsg

I have just opened it 5 min ago,btohqsg

Anyone familiar with using Kris+ for travel spend? Since it uses Google pay  the MCC code will be the travel agent? Means HSBC revolution would be the ideal card to pair with Kris+ cause CRMC excludes travel?,btohqsg
MCC is retained (so ya... avoid CRMC),btohqsg
Yep. If u spend at travel related stuff  will earn miles,btohqsg
OK thanks for the replies! Now need to find a card that gives bonus miles for travel/online  does not exclude gpay or travel  with as high a monthly limit as possible 🤔  sounds like DBS WWMC is the choice here,btohqsg
Which cash back card is best for paying medical (not hospitalization) expense?,btohqsg
Will I earn 4mpd on getgo using hsbc revolution ?,btohqsg
So kris + is not considered as online spending? Is it under travel category?,btohqsg
It’s considered online spending  but the mcc remains the same,btohqsg
So Kris+ is a wallet app that uses Gpay. So the original merchant MCC is retained.. meaning depending what you buy on Kris+ the MCC is different. Should count as online,btohqsg
But because it uses Gpay need to check if the card excludes mobile wallet payments,btohqsg
So amaze + crmc won't work cos the Mcc remains the same?,btohqsg
For travel merchants yes. For example  Eu holidays or CTC travel. At least from the way I understand and the replies I have gotten from experienced folksFor dining and the rest of the merchants on Kris+  CRMC + Amaze works,btohqsg
Have cash to pay for fully for hdb  it is stupid to pay fully for hdb? Or taking a loan is better,btohqsg
Do you have cpf OA to pay down the loan？,btohqsg
Pay cash is good   no more loan...,btohqsg
Not much cpf  don’t have a stable job  I think I might have problem securing a loan too,btohqsg
Whether it is better to pay for a HDB flat in cash or to take out a loan depends on your personal financial circumstances and goals. Here are some factors to consider:Interest Rates: If the interest rates on your savings or investments are lower than the interest rate on your HDB loan  it may make sense to take a loan and invest your money elsewhere. However  if the interest rate on your loan is higher than the return on your investments  it may be more financially prudent to pay cash for the HDB flat.Monthly Expenses: If you take out a loan  you will have to make monthly payments towards it. You should consider whether you can comfortably afford these payments without compromising your other financial goals.Opportunity Cost: If you have a large sum of cash that you could use to pay for your HDB flat  you should consider the opportunity cost of using that money. Would you be better off investing the money elsewhere  or using it for other expenses or financial goals?Risk Tolerance: Taking out a loan involves taking on debt  which may not be suitable for everyone. If you are risk-averse  you may prefer to pay for your HDB flat in cash and avoid taking on debt.Ultimately  there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. You should consider your own financial circumstances and goals before deciding whether to pay cash for your HDB flat or take out a loan. It may also be helpful to consult a financial advisor or planner for guidance.,btohqsg
Depends on your ability to invest. Or you want peace of mind of being loan free. No right and wrong. Depends on your situation and your feelings.,btohqsg
Hi all  why for the Ayam Penyet no Cashback of $1.80? It's under the qualified hawkers for DBS $3 Cashback,btohqsg
You should buy the more expensive item first.,btohqsg
What are the alternative to secure a loan besides  having a job😂 yes I do feel investing is way better than paying cash fully for hdb,btohqsg
Illegal money lenders  also known as ah long.,btohqsg
While having a job is a common way to secure a loan  there are alternative ways to do so  such as:Using Collateral: You can secure a loan by providing collateral  such as your home  car  or other valuable assets. This way  the lender has a form of security in case you are unable to repay the loan.Co-Signer: If you don't have a job or a good credit score  you can ask someone with a good credit history and stable income to co-sign the loan with you. The co-signer becomes responsible for the loan if you default on the payments.Peer-to-Peer Lending: Peer-to-peer lending platforms allow you to borrow money from individual investors. The investors review your credit history and decide whether to lend you money. This can be a good option if you have a good credit score  but no job or income.Savings Accounts: You can also consider taking a secured loan against your savings account. This way  you can use your savings as collateral  and the lender can provide you with a loan based on the value of your savings.It's important to note that each of these alternatives has its own risks and requirements  so it's important to research and understand the terms and conditions before applying for any loan.,btohqsg
Ahh icic thanks for the info,btohqsg
Actually although on paper the usual advise is to consider whether investment can earn more than the interest   I think in reality many people choose not to pay in full because it feel more safe to have some amount of liquid cash on hand.,btohqsg
"If its HDB loan there are other ""benefits"" too. Eg. If one of the couple pass away the other don't need to pay. You can Google for more info.",btohqsg

I want to qualify for the min spend criteria  not for cashback. So as long as I spend any transactions including insurance up to $500  I can get cash back for those eligible spend.,btohqsg
U check section 18 19 20 the “transaction” exclude insurance and also the other spend in section 19 also means it is excluded as it say other transactions. Hope I don’t confuse more than this 😆,btohqsg
I went to the bank to ask and she told me spend anything up to $500 without exclusions and the eligible spend will qualify for cashback. 😞,btohqsg

Hi bros. I need help  i am looking for starhub bank and account no to add as payee to pay for monthly bills to earn miles at citi  payall or card up.. how to check on this... I called starhub . They not keen to help on this,btohqsg
Is payment using Fairprice QR code on the Fairprice app considered online spending under the UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
I am not Starhub user but you can possibly pay with  your Citi card on the Starhub app,btohqsg
Ya  unless it’s excluded for miles for ur card otherwise it’s paying admin fees for no reason,btohqsg
I don't mind pay admin fee. As long as earn miles,btohqsg
So means I can earn miles using my miles card to pay for this,btohqsg
Think so. It did mention recurring payment but did not exclude telco,btohqsg
Like that I think can just use the StarHub app to add the credit card as a recurring paymentUnless Citibank Premiermiles excludes telco from their rewards,btohqsg
Okay hope it helps  sometimes the T&C just need to read a bit  should have most answers unless it’s ambiguous,btohqsg
Anyway I just checked Citi payall  seems like StarHub is not in the list for payment.I might be wrong,btohqsg
Bro  sometimes is not allow eg  by 3rd party eg axs .. payment for bills  nil miles earn,btohqsg
Or online banking payment  also disallow.,btohqsg
Uob one account  qualifying spend is by month one huh… just realise it doesn’t go by the credit card cycle,btohqsg
Thats why they keep wants us to use citi pay all and card for payment of bills,btohqsg

Guys be careful using axs pay plus earn.Pay insurance   phone bills   sp expenses by dbs woman .They use blocks of 5  less than 100 points earn.Use citi pay all better. I have earn 36000 miles there already,btohqsg

UOB one Debit Master card 500$ spend in overseas (Europe) hotel booking qualifies for 5% interest.Anyone can confirm?,btohqsg

Is CardUp really worth it based on this calculator? Is this for real?,btohqsg
That's adebitcard  so you'll be a new-to-bank customer,btohqsg
It depends on your redemption case and also your spending pattern.,btohqsg
That is what I have gotten after keying in my expenses,btohqsg
Another question you need to ask yourself is will you choose to spend $1944 to pay for 2 biz ticket to Bali or pay $460 for 2 budget airline tickets to fly to Bali?,btohqsg
But I have been holding the card for many years so you mean I cannot cancel because of my cashback,btohqsg
MH if I get to redeem for a Business ticket to London minimum  I will definitely use CardUp. But if it’s 1944 vs 460  I’d use 460 just on schedule alone. My experience also not really “downgraded”.,btohqsg
If you are ok redeeming SQ Y to Bali I think that’s not a bad option.,btohqsg
I won't pay. I use miles redemption   saver flight,btohqsg

"friend a bit hard to hint for special ""gift"" for buying. might end up with no friend.",btohqsg
Wanted to like “support him” but nvr bought this kind before,btohqsg
please it's it's a hot dog  don't waste your time.,btohqsg
you can always buy insurance separately like term insurance. insurance agents don't usually want to talk about term insurance as they don't earn much from it.,btohqsg
