SPO2 of 90 is fine just maybe asthma attack or smth similar,btohqsg
once below 90  going like 85 n below is q severe,btohqsg
unless u got COPD then 85-92 iirc is actl normal,btohqsg
Apparently Malaysia and Indonesia has them too,btohqsg
@kohsyanMy prof thinks it might be a Photon Number splitting attack  where 2 photons are simultaneously prepared in the same basis  Eve in the middle attacks by letting the first photon through  but utilise the spare generated photon to measure the basis it was generated in,btohqsg
Apparently the mitigation is intensity modulation in a random manner to probe if there is an attacker in the middle,btohqsg
oh shit i forgot to get back to you but,btohqsg
and also is the reason for narrative of single photon sources,btohqsg
independent sources same answer must be corright,btohqsg
need prepare for scientific advisory board,btohqsg

omg im the second subscriber 🤭,btohqsg
I tried to post on sgexams,btohqsg
But they keep removing my post despite me changing/starting a new account :<,btohqsg
Like I felt like the subreddit for NUS has lesser barrier to entry,btohqsg
cos we get way too many advertising posts so we have no choice but to control,btohqsg
we dw anyone and everyone to use our platforms for publicity,btohqsg
esp those that want to charge students a fee or are for profit cos we want to keep things accessible for everyone,btohqsg
so having to control what is allowed and what isnt is kinda bopes,btohqsg
anyways uhh send me ur post ill see what i can do,btohqsg
tiktok trends getting worse thses days,btohqsg
my n levels is like 2 months,btohqsg

I'm on my way to H3 Math now with your advice,btohqsg
not maths PhD yet? Bedok is a maths god,btohqsg
Imagine if people actually sued for every little mistake from a major company,btohqsg
My tongue burnt from coffeeshop coffee,btohqsg
I couldn't taste properly for the next few weeks,btohqsg
Fun Fact: If you get into a accident in the Us with a delivery company like fedex  you can sue them if they are at fault. Yes sue the company not the driver,btohqsg
My mind has devised a loophole,btohqsg
Get a friend to be fed(up)ex driver,btohqsg
Tdy rhd carnival at my school,btohqsg
I got free chem support by my cher,btohqsg
FedEx get sued so much there are lawyers specifically trained to handle fedex lawsuits,btohqsg
i only know silent deadly swift stingrays,btohqsg
Basically it’s a cat and mouse chase with fedex,btohqsg
They have a lot of money to pay it seems like,btohqsg
and I know that if I were to sign as a degree-holder  I won't rly be doing the things I loved,btohqsg
if I were to sign without a degree in my role  not v worth,btohqsg
yeah my me4 got put in a managerial role,btohqsg
in the engineering squadrons  the management are degree-holders (alongside the enciks),btohqsg
the people doing the real troubleshooting are mostly diploma holders  though they upskill after some time,btohqsg
if those ppl were to leave airforce  where do they usually head to?,btohqsg
variety  I see some going to semicon firms also,btohqsg
SIAEC and ST are safe bets yeah  they like the ex RSAF techs,btohqsg
wah the ppl rich enuf to sue man,btohqsg
but that's not all lah  see how you carry and market yourself,btohqsg
I think most military guys got standard,btohqsg
what abt go SIAEC for management role?,btohqsg
got any idea how long from ME4 to ME5 or not haha,btohqsg
i read some say like 10years,btohqsg
if degree-holder (me4) probably can? gov company like to see paper one,btohqsg
private firm not so picky  so I'd say more likely,btohqsg
not sure but shouldn't be so long,btohqsg
i hear some ppl say damn long sia haha  some say 8 to 10years  some say less,btohqsg
hmm I nvr heard anyth about it,btohqsg
I just feel if the progression is so slow  it won't be as competitive as private sector wages,btohqsg
esp since the workload for managerial regulators can be very intense,btohqsg
chill man I need my suit my eue de parfum,btohqsg
Need prepare stuff for this glorious day,btohqsg
then immediately change to a pink dress,btohqsg
yeah wym its a serious movie,btohqsg
same I wanna experience an existential crises during barbie,btohqsg
I dont think I will be ready but I will brace myself,btohqsg
lowkey ngl ah with all the suits and stuff  it might be the first time in 5 years i will take an instagram pic,btohqsg

My friends have already sold their possessions,btohqsg
like no joke they became monks,btohqsg
bro If you go to google,btohqsg
He gave me a pep talk,btohqsg
Like he just say that take the NS journey as simulation to the Civi world,btohqsg
Where if I can go through the toughest shit  why would I feel sad over how I feel when tough times don't last?,btohqsg
He was basically saying how life gets better eventually one...,btohqsg
In terms of training? Interpersonal relations? Teamwork?Logistics?Self discipline?Or others?,btohqsg
Physically tiring since the load and activities wouldn't be something you do as a civilian,btohqsg
That's the only tough part really,btohqsg
"Everything else is just ""yes and do""",btohqsg
If it's that  it happened to me too.Looking back  I'm really glad because it pushed me to exercise and acheive a healthier body for quite a number of years after that,btohqsg
if I looked at it back then the way I looked at it now  I would be so much happier because you are being paid full time to transform your body but so many others are paying others to transform theirs,btohqsg
the positive health benefits are going to last you at least a decade after ORD,btohqsg
Hopefully I still can get CG so free $$$ every year,btohqsg
I was never in sports cca  so you can imagine how much I struggled,btohqsg
during bmt I was always the last one in 3 km runs,btohqsg
Eventually I trained in the gym much more tiring than what I trained in NS 😂,btohqsg
Best place to achieve six pecs. Remember to take photo of it when you achieve it and then keep it for memories. 20 years later you become fat slob like me then cannot take liao,btohqsg
not because training is relaxed  but because all are more mature and know that just faster finish the training  do it once do it good. Settle and rest.,btohqsg
CoughsMy OC is a CPT  I'm in unit alr,btohqsg
being treated as slaves for 2 years,btohqsg
For the price I pay for my freedom  I don't see the issue ah,btohqsg
well uw serve u can serve,btohqsg
just dont force everyone to do it,btohqsg
Freedom before and after the 2 years,btohqsg
Agreed  not everyone would like it,btohqsg
i heard its been steadily increasing,btohqsg
Gotta write that in to the Gov  yo,btohqsg
my friend literally doing admin work for cti,btohqsg
yes  so they decided to isolate out singaporean/pr males,btohqsg
foreigners get everything for free huh.,btohqsg
their plan is literally leech off  after getting degree then get pr and then citizenship to skip ns,btohqsg
without subs i won't  and i didn't  understand a flipping shit,btohqsg
Another day  another American fact.In most Us states  there is a government website you can visit to see properties that are filled with property tax  usually 10-15% of the the properties’s value. If you pay it off  the owner of the property either has to pay you back the amount you paid or forfeit their property to you. After getting the property  you can get a new lease and either sell it or rent it to the owner at a price.How to get rich 101:,btohqsg
national defence is a public good,btohqsg
conscription is pretty much indefensible imo,btohqsg
esp when the conscription is discriminatory,btohqsg
what abt the pros and cons of conscripting males,btohqsg
but alot of the top ppl leave sg cos of ns,btohqsg
accepted? working well? strong public support?? 🤡🤡🤡,btohqsg
i dont agree with a single of their sentences,btohqsg
the top 1% might own 90% of the worlds wealth,btohqsg
the top 1% of innovators contribute 99% to the advancement of mankind,btohqsg
no its not working well LOL,btohqsg
its just working better than our neighbours military,btohqsg
u dont even need ns for that,btohqsg
even if i accept that without conscription  we wld all be slaughtered by another country,btohqsg
which i don't  just to be clear,btohqsg
i used to be q proud of sg,btohqsg
saf has casted a vanishing spell on that,btohqsg
I'm not wrong am I 🗿,btohqsg
If not I'm reporting to lawyer alr,btohqsg

Bruh i have no pink shirts,btohqsg

Pray for my friend guys she has uni lectures on healthy living at 11pm oh my god,btohqsg
Practicing what they preach doesn’t seem to be a priority lol,btohqsg
I went to see Oppenheimer over Barbie and I think frankly  the story of Oppenheimer and the way it is told is much more important to hear than Barbie.,btohqsg
The movie takes the opposite approach to modern filmmaking  it is a biography after all  and the subject matter is just so dark and impactful,btohqsg
There are parts of the movie where Nolan can make you physically jolt from shock of the sound in the theatre  and the emotion of seeing some of the choices they make is intense man,btohqsg
The intensity is driven not by just noise but the contrast of silence and appearance. It’s beautiful  not the most happy  but it tries to be true in telling the history of one of the most important things that happened in the last. It made me think quite a bit anyway  about something that remains relevant and true  about choices we make. Important movie for sure.,btohqsg
i near city centre so dh here,btohqsg
imagine filming a biography that's happening in the present 💀,btohqsg
low key me during undergrad at times,btohqsg
"Must go""I haven't study but it's too easy anyway""",btohqsg
Nuclear bomb is  so ez to make,btohqsg

According to the SPF  the 36-year-old officer worked fewer than 30 days in 2022 & had the police called on him following an incident at home.➡️https://bit.ly/3K9WTlYFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
Learnt the commanding officer mentioned Zed teo is a high flyer in the civil service that was the assistant to K. Shanmugam from2015-2017,btohqsg
he left the service in may 2023 for a private company,btohqsg
ngl ah I really think is cos the guy snitch then he kenna targeted,btohqsg
like yk some ppl very ups,btohqsg
I have rarely experienced it but in his case other stuff also lead to him getting bullied like the leave and snitching and going against co,btohqsg
so all these factors made it worse,btohqsg
but I feel anyone with the same circumstances as him wld have gotten bullied ngl,btohqsg
But it’s still very sad that he couldn’t get help,btohqsg
If he got terminated this would have not happened,btohqsg
there are alot of majority race ppl who are like him and got bullied so idk sia,btohqsg
I feel it’s about whistleblower protection,btohqsg
Negligible ehh depends on character other factors,btohqsg

@chemcer@Voidchordswanna hear a weird asf story that happened to me,btohqsg
or is still happening to me,btohqsg
ok so when we were done with our 2nd call i went to buy lunch  my snr medic haven't even ordered his yet  then abt 1min before my food was ready  the snr medic told me that we got call and i have to go back to ambulance to go to call location,btohqsg
but then guess what  the paramedic told me to collect my food and go back to firepost ,btohqsg
plot twist  firepost was locked  and i didn't have the key,btohqsg
so i was stuck outside in the hot sun (which was everyday in SAF so im used to it) for abt an hr  or maybe less,btohqsg
the other ambulance crew came back and then saw me outside and they were in shock,btohqsg
and i told them the situation of what happened  and i went inside,btohqsg
the other ambulance crew A122 (im A123) abt 10min later went for call,btohqsg
no lah dei i paid for it alr,btohqsg
and then i went to sleep (got nothing better to do),btohqsg
then all of a sudden A123 got call  i woke up and saw the FP void of people,btohqsg
i checked outside to see if A123 was outside but it wasn't  so i realised they didn't even return to base and they got called,btohqsg
AND THE STORY DOESN'T END THERE,btohqsg
30min later  i see my snr medic call me like 2 times to ask me to collect his food  but me being the idiot i am went outside and closed the door  only to realise i didn't have key and the door auto locks,btohqsg
so once i went out and took the food and returned,btohqsg
when i went to SGH to send patient  A122 sent another patient at ard same time  turns out he was a cbt medic,btohqsg
if only we took that call sia,btohqsg
how can i compete with the great bedok,btohqsg
ehhh ive been counting down since more than 400 days ago,btohqsg

Dear (whoever) intro who you are and what’s the email for. then like attached is my writeup etc. Thank you.Best regards your name,btohqsg
people don’t have time to read through your shit,btohqsg
All my homies hate situational writing,btohqsg
I cant think of a singular more useless thing in sg curriculum,btohqsg
Character and citizenship education in primary school  it’s “form teacher time” in sec school,btohqsg
I mean that is a virtual signalling for govt,btohqsg
"But situation writing is touted as a ""functional skill"" but fails to do that",btohqsg
When the teacher is not even required to be in class tho,btohqsg
Might as well go home better,btohqsg
Its not abt u the student  its abt the govt saying look we care abt ethics in education during external audit,btohqsg
He can help u unpack what NS has done to u,btohqsg
The new curriculum has Ft time,btohqsg
situational writing is an actual examinable component that’s so far from what people use irl,btohqsg
Wait till you see the new way they test listening compre,btohqsg
or u literaily go to a news radio channel and write a summary of what happened and then search online to see if you were right,btohqsg
random thoughts:It suddenly cross my mind that the affairs of the government has double meaning,btohqsg

karen ard the world gonna rage at sg for 'women's rights' and wtv bs,btohqsg
i just learnt that for the cops to catch you on drug trafficking charge  you dont need to be seen at the airport with it,btohqsg
as long as there is a reasonable suspicion you are transporting drugs from one part of sg to another  that could also be a drug trafficking charge,btohqsg
or is that not the case?,btohqsg
never been caught by police for drug trafficking before,btohqsg
nah..cause i imagine  if that is the case...alot of ppl bout be surprised with the death penalty passing narcotics from one person to another,btohqsg
it’s clearly described in the actual law,btohqsg
As surprised as people realizing that the law is written there clearly since god knows when  and that plenty of such cases have been reported in the news.,btohqsg
cause all along i thought you were caught if you were travelling through the airport  not on the city streets,btohqsg
if you’re in possession of more than a certain amount you’re presumed to be trafficking,btohqsg
if you’re trafficking more than 25g it’s the death penalty,btohqsg
You thought… You can also think unicorns exist. But no mate. Far from it.You can try to cherry pick the laws. I wouldn’t advise it.,btohqsg
just something i realised recently  thats all,btohqsg
Clearly you mean more than this  what with the previous posting about the executions.The majority supports the tough stance on drugs and capital punishment.,btohqsg
You’re free to try to sway people’s opinion. As are people to resist them here.Peddling weak ass justifications like the laws aren’t clear enough is just pffft. Try harder.,btohqsg
the law was amended in 2013  certain cases was shifted to life imprisonment. So after 2013  if someone was still hanged..they were definitely more than a peddler/trafficker,btohqsg
im not swaying public opinion..never said anything bout not supporting or supporting the death penalty. Was just intrigued by the cases,btohqsg
thanks i need this for oral tdy,btohqsg
new syllabus for o’s is so hard,btohqsg
