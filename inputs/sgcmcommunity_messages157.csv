About as zhun as my car having 600bhp,btohqsg
Wah I'll eat my words sekali this one really low mileage,btohqsg
anyway why yall keep posting sold cars,btohqsg
Should the admin verify the advertised info is all correct b4 posting?,btohqsg
They weren't sold when i made this post 😭😭😭 - F,btohqsg
info correct doesn't mean the dealer is telling the truth,btohqsg
Verifying info is the least the admin can do? Believing Salesman’s pitch is at consumer’s discretion?,btohqsg
eh  in between drafting the post and posting it the car got sold... just unfortunate coincidence,btohqsg
if you think is easy you be admin la,btohqsg
Like admin say got time delay,btohqsg
They schedule the post so everyday will have something for us to view,btohqsg
Not really admin fault if he schedule for X date X time  then Y date Y time sell,btohqsg
But the mileage maybe cus engine overhaul also,btohqsg
nah engine overhaul sure put one,btohqsg
can increase price by few thousand that kind,btohqsg
Like tht Sgcarmart used car section can close down alrdy,btohqsg

They did verify some info. When u sell car  the ads will not be posted immediately. They will do some checking,btohqsg
Like I mentioned before  mine was updated as sold. Admin can always contact me to verify.,btohqsg
of all the different salesman  car salesmen are the least trustworthy lmao,btohqsg
Sgcm has responsibility to ensure. Its how they do it. Else consumer gets all the wrong info.,btohqsg
i'm not generalising of course but too many bad apples,btohqsg
But consumers are often scared away by high mileage or ex phv vehicles  so irresponsible ones smoke,btohqsg
Can they ensure all mileage r correct?,btohqsg
Or ensure car is 100% accident free?,btohqsg
