Teacher was stunned so we just left and instead we just walk around the school for fun,btohqsg
had a talk with my dad and he gave me a pass on dating girls as long as no hanky panky is involved,btohqsg
You just reminded me of this,btohqsg
Meanwhile my dad asking ‚Äúgot any pretty girls at my poly anot‚Äù,btohqsg

bro cannot look at face oni,btohqsg
One category is where they are constantly surrounded by boys.. 2 girls to 10 guy type of ratio  the other is they are constantly surrounded by a female Friend group 5-6 girls in that group,btohqsg
i actually hv work to do,btohqsg
At this point  I‚Äôm not even looking for one,btohqsg
I‚Äôm on the brink of dropping out I think,btohqsg
1.67 gpa for a first sem,btohqsg
Came in as a common course,btohqsg
Now In my diploma   digital design,btohqsg
Someone sent a duster into my mouth b4,btohqsg
One of my friends launched one of them at a teacher,btohqsg
The 2466 members believe in you,btohqsg
That shit either was weak as shit or broke cause I saw nothing,btohqsg
All I saw was a half opened pen pointed at the teacher and his face lit up,btohqsg
But the teacher literally had no reaction,btohqsg
What I need are the jc kids to pray for me,btohqsg
Jc and poly learning style diff,btohqsg
U wan can ask uni kids,btohqsg
Poly mug one time good one every 9 week?,btohqsg
Every 10 wk got one exam,btohqsg
If u count mid sem one ah,btohqsg
If u dun care that one den every 20 weeks,btohqsg
These test will add up plus your major exam,btohqsg
For two of my modules  the final exam only made up 30% of the whole module grade,btohqsg
The other 70% consisted of daily lessons and it‚Äôs test,btohqsg
Hence why a lot actually Lyra to get one through internship,btohqsg
True but some company outside dont care if u poly or ite,btohqsg
Probably poly grad starting pay abit higher than ite grad,btohqsg
I heard of stories of internship  people becoming dishwashers,btohqsg
Cause they faced some complains.. some issues then the company decided to just throw him to become s dishwasher for the company,btohqsg
For the remaining of his internship,btohqsg
I‚Äôm already done with my yr,btohqsg
Going back as a y2 next year hopefully,btohqsg
bro even have a communist tele,btohqsg
the video is 15 and a half minutes long üóø,btohqsg
that pic above has a timestamp,btohqsg
I can't fathom the lengths you need to go and ask girls to satisfy your insatiable lusts holy shit,btohqsg
that is a time stamp for the time it was posted,btohqsg
I meant the fact he kept pmming girls,btohqsg
Got a sticker pack made of him,btohqsg
Ya and the thing is the police cannot do anything cuz he has mental issues,btohqsg
And then I think cuz of his mental issues,btohqsg
He doesn't need to be scared of police,btohqsg
i swear to god...i really hate these kind of ppl  my sec school also had one,btohqsg
got away committing crimes that a normal individual would have otherwise gotten arrested for,btohqsg
My friend suck into singapore 1 tonne of firecrackers,btohqsg
We dk where to find him,btohqsg
and brought some to school to sell it to students,btohqsg
I wonder what videos these sickos watched,btohqsg
idk if he is deaf makes it better or worse,btohqsg
No if u kill someone in sg is cfm life sentence,btohqsg
then those students lit it in the toilet,btohqsg
But cuz he got mental issues,btohqsg
and you can smell the fumes,btohqsg
like I get it  we're all horny sometimes but chill bruh,btohqsg
if you kill someone in a road accident,btohqsg
you get a few weeks in jail,btohqsg
But I think the RV guy is purposely,btohqsg
I still rmb this incident like it was yesterday,btohqsg
This guy knew he had a illness that could render him unconscious and still decided to get behind a wheel,btohqsg
can we be abit more sensitve,btohqsg
btw isn't there another peeping tom telegram channel that popped up?,btohqsg
is the one i was mentioning about,btohqsg
we gettin' attention for the wrong reasons ‚ò†,btohqsg
do we use lorry or truck?,btohqsg
If you look up road traffic accidents and the penalties drivers faced if they kill someone,btohqsg
it really will make you feel like...anytime  someone can run you over  kill you and essentially get away,btohqsg
lorry more commonly cos british english origins but tbh both,btohqsg
Thats why the best way to kill someone is to drive a car and ramm the person,btohqsg
This guy was not drunk driving...but drug driving,btohqsg
he was driving while impaired with drugs,btohqsg
5 yr prison 20 year ban driving,btohqsg
So now he out n alive,btohqsg
speaking of driving  yall planning to get licence?,btohqsg
U wont know when u need to drive,btohqsg
imagine...becoming a judge and you come across a case where you cant make a sound decision,btohqsg
Its ok to get license even if your family dont have car to drive,btohqsg
yea their expiriy dates are like 3 decades down the road,btohqsg
my dad rents a car during hari raya,btohqsg
otherwise he'd ride his bike or take public transport,btohqsg
my brother has a bike but idk if I wanna get a license,btohqsg
Unless u old af rdy den need go refresher course if i rmb correctly,btohqsg
the more you read up on these fatal incidents..the more you just realise the roads is one dangerous wheel of fortune,btohqsg
"i chanced upon a car accident that basically....made you think ""how""",btohqsg
Snd thatd why they add more and more stuff to your driving lessons,btohqsg
Used to not have simulation classes,btohqsg
I stick to bus and mrt for now lol,btohqsg

Even if you dont/your family doesnt own a car  it's still a great skill to acquire,btohqsg
Oh I experienced hit and run b4,btohqsg

It hit an elderly and ran,btohqsg

Anyone know any good places to find student competitions?,btohqsg
Ye like where to find these hackathon,btohqsg
ntu blasts me with hackathon emails all the time,btohqsg
I got some exp in coding,btohqsg
no it‚Äôs just a general term,btohqsg
usually it‚Äôs like they give a problem statement and you‚Äôve some time (maybe a few days) to work out a solution project,btohqsg
so it‚Äôs not just being good at coding,btohqsg
like one i took part in asked about projects that would align with singapore‚Äôs vision of sustainability,btohqsg
yea it commonly tackles social/business/innovation problems,btohqsg
but for more public ones you can check Devpost,btohqsg
every year ntu has a deep learning week that i think is open to all students,btohqsg
second half of the year so probs look for others for now haha,btohqsg
in field camp i got hip pain because i nvr adjust my LBS properly lmao,btohqsg
first 2 chapters of my Physics book done  yay,btohqsg

data engineering (under school of electronics & info-comm technology),btohqsg
From my draft copy to the editor,btohqsg
omg this reminds me of physics,btohqsg
yes i say that as i turn 26 this year,btohqsg
at least you gain age experience,btohqsg
ohh nice good way to visualise the components,btohqsg
All explanation questions.Now doing Dynamics  eg,btohqsg
A rocket is accelerating forward by burning fuel to eject gas backwards. Explain how the ejection of gas backwards produce an forward force on the rocket.,btohqsg
Explain how cushions may reduce the risk of injury during a fall.,btohqsg
A rocket  filled with fuel  is standing vertically on a launchpad and at rest. Gas is ejected upon ignition  such that an upwards thrust is exerted on the rocket. A short interval passed between ignition and lift-off. Explain this observation.,btohqsg
I'm not good at this lol,btohqsg
last year A lvl  many questions came out from my initial drafts already lol,btohqsg
I'm behind time  supposed to finish all these 2 days ago,btohqsg
idk if I can survive in JC üíÄ,btohqsg
so you can tell if its going to rain?,btohqsg
it's more like collecting data from a data source then use coding/scripting to provide analyses  insights and solutions,btohqsg
I need to collect data from a government website about the age groups in sg,btohqsg
essentially rocket equation without the rocket equation haha,btohqsg
Once collected  I'd use a programming software like Jupyter Notebook which has Python to breakdown the entire database,btohqsg
or if I need to generate data visualisations such as pie charts  I'd use Pycharm,btohqsg
"A man was tasked to push a wheelbarrow. He refused and argued: ""according to the Newton's third Law  when I try to pushthe wheelbarrow forward with a force F  wheelbarrow exerts a force backwards exactly equal to F. Since the forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction  they cancel out and the wheelbarrow and myself will not move"".Evaluate the man's arugment.",btohqsg
python in juypter looks like this,btohqsg
It looks like a plain google docs lor,btohqsg
anyone have their phone lag before,btohqsg
like i cannot press the button,btohqsg
i try force quit also cannot,btohqsg
I got mine for less than 500,btohqsg

I just realised how to even transfer data to a new phone,btohqsg
do you have a sim card?,btohqsg
Even Apple to Apple will be a problem cos I cannot scan the thing,btohqsg
my entire lcd replacement is only 200,btohqsg
the shop has genuine apple parts and is one of the very few shops certified by apple,btohqsg
If my mental calculations are correct u can expect a 30 percent y-o-y acceleration of cubic meters per kcal,btohqsg
Man How do I tell my mom she keeps interrupting my diet plans,btohqsg
