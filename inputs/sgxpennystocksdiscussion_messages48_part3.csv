For an old man to get COVID every hour is impt. Media just keep milking this to gain eyeballs. Indirectly help DT publicise and for people to forget about Biden,btohqsg
I tried riding along on VP but failed. üòõ,btohqsg
Beside gloves  I see Ix Bio & Avarga got potential,btohqsg
Acromec  cfm  Eindec all no good lah. Don't compare those to MTp  TG  RS and UG.Aspen has its own believers. Time will tell.,btohqsg
Asking for his opinion ma since he said VP speculation,btohqsg
Yup I have no issues also haha,btohqsg
Share share each other opinion no prob. üëç,btohqsg
I too poor for MT UG RS TG le,btohqsg
These cmin week can contra though. Won‚Äôt lose much,btohqsg
But can gain a lot. Worth the risk,btohqsg
VP next 6 months results should be good. But from now till then there will be better time to buy.,btohqsg
Zai ur head. When i bought it drop to 12x or 11x. Forgot,btohqsg
I will be very careful with medical stocks le,btohqsg
I think UG is the cheapest. Buy a bit for investment  at least until early next year.Low cost with high potential .,btohqsg
CFM ?I slightly better in medical counters.,btohqsg
BMW or bicycle depend on you,btohqsg
Medical stocks honestly to me not much meat left le,btohqsg
It's always one step up two steps down,btohqsg
Unless you very nimble or you always buy at low then ok,btohqsg
Eindec is involve in specialise ventilation.  Singapore is too small a market for it. I understand they are going to penetrate the China market  that where the dollar‚Äôs will be .,btohqsg
Is either in now or regret later,btohqsg
Becsuse is still your own money,btohqsg
Honestly also no catalyst for it to fly,btohqsg
If there is any reason just BB want to fry it up loh,btohqsg
Is either you believe or you don't believe hahaha,btohqsg
That why we are in this penny stock discussion,btohqsg
You make this kind of statement based on belief is,btohqsg
If you have read through the whole financial report,btohqsg
Most of us been saying medtec has good fundamental,btohqsg
Will advise to read up more before you commit,btohqsg
Heegul and john is good at catching BB,btohqsg
You have been saying 2 weeks in a row 1.6 le,btohqsg
To be honest  they will hit 1.6 near soon,btohqsg
Just that i hope is Friday,btohqsg
I dont know when but i hope is Friday,btohqsg
Many of us here vested in MT  all of is hope everyday will fly,btohqsg
Maybe we can think this way.If the company bosses themselves are willing to buy back the shares at a certain price  it means they are well clear about the direction the company is moving forward. Coupled it along with the latest financial report plus the next Qtrly/FY results  wouldn‚Äôt it be to our advantage to hold against the BBs? üòÅ,btohqsg
Sure will teach one Friday if the covid situation still serious,btohqsg
Singapore company to be successful in China will be very difficult unless big brand name or super complex technology. One year and you will have 100 competetors doing same thing.,btohqsg
Insider will know the news first,btohqsg
Some of us work in a listed company  we know how the game is play,btohqsg
When its an open secret it's no longer a secret,btohqsg
That's what I said about TG,btohqsg
Everyone say choing to buy TG the day before results released,btohqsg
And also take into acc the following stock prices have fall to current prices from their previous highs. So that‚Äôs another +ve we can risk,btohqsg
Im not sure about TG because i dont read their stats,btohqsg
And their price is more than OCBC,btohqsg
A glove company stock can win a bank,btohqsg
Actually my tp for MT is not 1.6,btohqsg
The technical part you can read from the company website. If not for C19  I would not bother to read into it.Currently the pricing is Low.  Worth to take a risk.,btohqsg
