Gloves orders are ensured till 2022 at least. But doesnâ€™t seem the release of vaccine will further increase the demand. It should just more or less shift the usage of gloves from one purpose to another.,btohqsg
Gloves demand will be there. But JPM does have some relevant pts. The increase in capacity will reduce the asp starting next year.,btohqsg
And don't you think more volume would improve their margins to make up for asp drop?,btohqsg
Why do u think volume will improve,btohqsg
Asp drop is industry wideSo to make up for it they gained market share,btohqsg
If anything  they are facing more competition than ever before. Other players all made big money relatively. Pie grow exponentially there is no worry about market shareCannibalism will occur eventually.Easy to say TG has biggest capacity and market leader got more ammo can fight price war etcFirstly is it worthwhile to engage in that. Secondly even if they does  their whole valuation need to be reevaluated.Doesnâ€™t come by coincidence so many big gloves companies all from Malaysia. If want to consolidate or take them out  plenty of chances in the past. Not when all grow fat and rich,btohqsg
"Good morning Hustlepeople!QOTD:""Be patient with yourself. Self-growth is tender; it's holy ground. There's no greater investment.""-Stephen CoveyDifficult market. Play with care. Nimble hands only and best to reduce counters. Reminder to all  8 or 9/10 contra players lose. The stock market is designed in this way.PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.",btohqsg
Very good advise for all stock investers.,btohqsg
