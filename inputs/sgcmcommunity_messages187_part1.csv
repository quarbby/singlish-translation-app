hi  would like to get some advice on getting a new car. Usually is the subsidy/rebate for in-house insurance/financing worth it (about 8k rebate for the car I'm looking at)? Or is it better to source for your own bank/insurer to get better rates?For the loan  it needs to be minimum 60k for 6 years to qualify for the rebate.,btohqsg
how much the car price? 60k loan is not a lot la for 6 years,btohqsg
car price is about 189k excluding subsidy,btohqsg
In house loan generally for people who take full loan or people who banks reject  if you can get bank loan just get bank,btohqsg
The dealer usually will also let you choose from a few of their preferred banks also other than in house,btohqsg
I see. not sure if most people take the 8k subsidy so just wanted to get some advice on the pros/cons. thanks for your help,btohqsg
Very easy to hit that mark.. loan 50% also easily 90k,btohqsg
