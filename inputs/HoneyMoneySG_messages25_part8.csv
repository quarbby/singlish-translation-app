The assessable income is based on how much your company files for you.,btohqsg
Then the rebates/reliefs are then calculated then they will tax your chargeable income,btohqsg
Do you mean 6k of CPF tax relief?,btohqsg

Hey does anyone know if CRMC paired with ShopBack pay for retail still can get 4MPD?,btohqsg
currently have about 31k+ in my OA and 16k+ in my MA. is it wise for me to max my MA immediately? realised that i can probably hit it by the end of this year.Math:current OA = 31k+current MA = 16k+monthly cpf into OA  1150*12 = 13800monthly cpf into MA  400*12 = 4800vcma = 8kMA EOY = 16k + 8k + 4800 + 39700(OA) = 68500OA EOY = 5.1k~go? no-go?,btohqsg
You can transfer from OA to SA ... Not to MA.,btohqsg
There's no point for you to aim for FRS at this stage. If you are very sure you won't need your OA for property  by all means transfer to SA. Most of the times  property returns are better than the additional interest you get from transferring from OA to SA as you are often leveraging for property.,btohqsg
I’m getting my flat this year  wonder if I should move my OA to SA or park it a side  or just let HDb deduct all my OASince interests will have to be pay back if flat will be sold (but we’ve no plans yet)   better I pay minimal instead?,btohqsg
5k per transaction. 10k in a month.  30k in a year,btohqsg
I would use CPF OA to pay for the mortgage. Especially now with the high bank and FD interest rates the cash can be used to earn more interest than OA.,btohqsg
Hi what is the highest interest saving account without salary credit other than uob one and trust?,btohqsg
does it make sense to transfer funds from UOB one acc to HSBC EGA monthly? Assume both accounts have around 25k.Salary credit into UOB One acc  able to hit 500 spending in uob one card and 2.8k spending in HSBC Advance card,btohqsg
Hi experts can i check something with regard to UOB ONE card:Is there a specific month like Jan Feb Mar (1st Quarter) to clock the rebate or it start from the point when i first used the card? I have just gotten the card so i am wondering should i start using it or should i wait till the qualifying month to start using it.,btohqsg
everyone quarter month is different. It start form the month the card is approved,btohqsg
I see. So if my card approve in end dec and i start using say in January statement then i have already miss one month?,btohqsg
for first quarter  you get 2/3 of tiered quarterly rebate if met spending for 2nd and 3rd month  1/3 if met spending for 3rd month,btohqsg
Can anyone confirm I thought purchasing gigabuck gives 4mpd,btohqsg

Hi  I recently applied the hsbc revolution card and still the midst of processing. I like to topup $5k my grab card using my uob absolute before they nerf it. Will this affect my credit rating and my hsbc application?,btohqsg
Anyone has any clue regarding this,btohqsg
Does the credit card bank look at unbilled statement too when they issue the card?,btohqsg
Once you pay you can split into installments on the citi app. But beware  you may be asked to pay an admin charge. Also  you won't earn points for installment payments (not that insurance will earn any points anyway),btohqsg
I paid my insurance last month around $6k  but uob haven't bill me.,btohqsg
are you asking about general installment payments  or citi payall?Either way just FYI CRMC is a bad card  citi payall only gives 0.4mpd  or 0 miles if u pay by the credit card,btohqsg
How long did you wait since you apply,btohqsg
You are spending with a different card from a different bank  so I don't see how HSBC will be able to look at that data,btohqsg
Around a week or two. Did you apply through singpass signup,btohqsg
Not sure if I should get a new card just to pay for my insurance,btohqsg
