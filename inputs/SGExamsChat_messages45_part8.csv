she is the best politician.  very kind and intelegent woman.I love Angela Merkel,btohqsg
whut lermao yu meen teenz aren't da besto besto et eigo???,btohqsg
intelligent*Anyway  as the rest have pointed out  this group comprises of mostly Singaporean teenagers  who mostly use Singlish  kind of an English creole so to speak  not exactly standard English  so it might not be the best place for you to learn proper English. Nevertheless  you are welcome to stay if you wish.,btohqsg
"a mother tongue formed from the contact of a European language (especially English  French  Spanish  or Portuguese) with local languages (especially African languages spoken by slaves in the West Indies).""a Portuguese-based Creole""",btohqsg
learnt this word from The 100 it needs to be in your Netflix watchlist if it isnt yet,btohqsg
JP Wiki 1st Sentenceクレオール言語（クレオールげんご、英: creole language）とは、意思疎通ができない異なる言語圏の間で交易を行う際、商人らなどの間で自然に作り上げられた言語（ピジン言語）が、その話者達の子供たちの世代で母語として話されるようになった言語を指す。,btohqsg
We're back to the days of Syonan-To,btohqsg
We have to pay the Price of Peace again,btohqsg
lol people still arent being careful,btohqsg
nowadays you just put the number with no context,btohqsg
oh no three healthcare professionals got infected,btohqsg
When I was in sec 2,btohqsg
I really thought combined sciences is more complicated than the pure sciences,btohqsg
Cause I thought they would be mixing the two subjects together,btohqsg
After that is bloody fuckin orange,btohqsg
A complex square matrix X is said to be a unitary matrix if XX * = I.Where X * represents the conjugate transposed matrix (or adjoint matrix) of matrix X  and I is the unit matrix.i is an imaginary unit.Answer the following questions:(1) Let n be a positive integer and let A and B be n-dimensional unitary matrices. Show that matrix AB is also a unitary matrix.(2) Let n be a positive integer  let C and D be n-dimensional real square matrices  define matrix F as F = C + iD  and matrix GG = (C  -D \\ D  C)Show the equivalence of matrix F being unitary to matrix G being orthogonal.(3) Find the eigenvalue of the following matrix.(1/2) * (1 1 1 1 \\ 1  i  -1  -i \\ 1  -1 1  -1 \\ 1  -i  -1  i)(4) Let n be a positive integer  and let the (j  k) component q_jk of the n-dimensional square matrix Q beq_jk = (1 / sqrt (n)) exp (2 * pi * i * (j-1) * (k-1) / n)Show that the matrix Q is a unitary matrix.(5) Show that 2-dimensional unitary matrix of determinant 1 has the form:H = (exp (ia) cos (b)  exp (ia) sin (b) \\-exp (-ia) sin (b)  exp (-ia) cos (b))Where b and a are real numbers.(6) Find the general form of the 2-dimensional unitary matrix.Pretty close the google translation,btohqsg
