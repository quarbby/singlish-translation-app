Okay I just checked again.. the charges is not by premium  it's policy value.. so the bonus CANNOT cover the charges one üòÖüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Meaning the more u earn the more charges right üòÇ,btohqsg
investing thru insurer is typically a bad idea. pick up some investing knowledge instead  learn what is low cost investing  diversification and how different asset classes fit into ur risk profile.,btohqsg
Yea but from what i read  the charges are only for the first 10 years. If you are going to invest it like the 20-30 years you said  when you use brokers they are going to charge you the whole 20-30 years and when you have a bigger pot at that stage technically the brokerage fees you pay will also be higher. Its really up to your investment horizon.,btohqsg
But if I‚Äôm not wrong  brokers like tiger brokers waive custodian fees if there are regular transactions so won‚Äôt the fees incurred in this case just be the trading fee (which is significantly lower than the 10 year fees that AIA(for eg) charges)?,btohqsg
Brokerage fees are last thing to worry üòÇ more on fund performance   but imo DIY is always better,btohqsg
"Yea but idk if u do the math of 12K premium each year with 8% returns for your investment horizon of 30 years if i do the math  after the 15th year mark  the ""fees"" is already higher when u use robo advisors when compared to the APA.",btohqsg
correct which is why the right FA matters! someone who actually consults you every month or so to discuss about your fund performance and do fund switching because its eventually free to switch funds afterall.,btohqsg
Right FA ‚Ä¶ maybe as hard as finding needle in sea ü´† best is depend on ownself,btohqsg
We are not talking about robo advisors.We are talking about brokers like poems or fund supermart where they only charge a one time fee for purchase of the funds.They don‚Äôt charge the hefty commission that insurance agents charge for the first few years of your ILP.All funds regardless bought from brokers or insurance agents will have ongoing fund management fee from the fund manager.,btohqsg
HAHAHAH very true! But mine helped me alot and i managed to pay off for my ec downpayment with my fiance. And he js also helping alot of my friends from uni too. So yea if anyone needs a recco can pm me!,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs more of you and your friends helping the Insurance Agent to achieve his income goals. Haha,btohqsg
there's no way ilp fee is lower. insurer take a cut  agent take a cut  fund manager take a cut. most ppl jus dunno where the cut was taken from.,btohqsg
Never invest through insurance agents.Always buy term insurance and invest yourself.Insurance Agents should just stick to selling insurance and not investments.,btohqsg
Hi shifus Let‚Äôs say the mcc transaction use physical payment is 5812 (dining)Instarem concerts it to online spend mcc 5812  or online spend diff mcc?Tia!,btohqsg
LOL this sentence demonstrates the lack of financial finesseIf u plan to DCA  switching around just defeats the purpose.If u want to do active investing  why use an insurer platform which is higher cost with restrictive choices.ILP is the WORST product to buy in insurance period.,btohqsg
There is ZERO basis to support using ILP for investment purpose whether being a dca or active type of investor,btohqsg
I think people in the group chat would be able to discern genuine investment testimonials or camouflaged agent referral attempts.,btohqsg
This is true. My advise is don't get ILPs through insurance. As I have shared before. My relative being charged of at least 60% in fees.If he bought the similar etf directly. He probably earn near to 3x of current insurance. And now he just breakeven..... And this is best case scenerio as the funds he bought appreciated quite a lot in value.....Because first have management fee per year. I guess is around 3+%.Then the insurance portion which need a math professor to know. But i guess is around 3% to 6%. Then is bid and ask spread. The buying and selling of the fund is 10%. Which means if u buy and sell in just 1 second. Your portfolio gone 10% in value....So in all your profit is all taken by insurance agent and insurance companies. It definitely help them achieve their financial goal faster. ü§£,btohqsg
No sure u purposely bring up the subject to let your fake Id promote or you really ask. If u really ask then the above is my answer.,btohqsg
HAHA like that also kena  i was genuinely asking. But yea  thanks for all the help guys  really super helpful bunch :),btohqsg
Sorry for being suspicious. But sometime insurance agent will try to promote. üòÇ,btohqsg
LOL ngl it does sound like a good strat now that u mention it... maybe i should charge commissionüòÇ,btohqsg
It's ok if you put in 20 years because fees is up to 10 years only. But if you're like me putting 10 years then is disadvantagous. I planning to free look it.,btohqsg
Hi! Can I check if I use Apple Pay for in-app purchases or like when I go to restaurants  I scan QR code to order and pay using Apple Pay  do these count as online purchase for UOB evol?,btohqsg
Hi  Cupid. Contactless means the card has to ‚Äúkiss‚Äù üíãthe terminal n the terminal responses with beep sound.Mobile contactless means your device/phone has to ‚Äúkiss‚Äù üíãthe terminal.,btohqsg
Wei Xuanif you pay through the app or website  is online.,btohqsg
"Their ""power duo"" thing is a marketing gimmick. The 2 accounts have always been like that. They're just trying to trick you to get their low interest of 3% p.a. from UOB Stash Account.There's other high yield savings account available  or as I explained to Alvin earlier  put excess funds into tbills or mmf.",btohqsg
No interest from chocolate finance yesterday. Anyone experienced the same ?,btohqsg
If there is any update on the intrest from Chocolate Finance. Please share here. I tried to access their website and it is under maintenance as well.,btohqsg
Hi all  may I know if banks offer special promotional rates for renovation loan if we call in to them for enquiry?Do we need to call each bank to source and compare the best rates?,btohqsg
There are 2 fees u pay when u do ILP through Insurance Agent1. Agent commission = up to 50% for first 2 years and this comes from your investment amount. Eg u pay $10k premium per year  only $5k goes to buying the actual investments. $5k disappears to the agent as commissions. After year 2  the commission is less but still have. Maybe (I am also not sure) it stops after year 10.2. Fund management fee = usually 1-3% depending on the fund chosen and this is an ongoing charge by the fund manager as long as u hold the fund. It is never free no matter u buy from broker directly or through Insurance Agent.,btohqsg
1. For ILP with coverages then yes  it's based on premium and it becomes lesser after each premium paid (so more are allocated to the funds). And after x years they may allocate more after. This depends on what the policy contract says.But for ILP with pure investments  there's a flat % supplementary charge ontotal policy value (including bonuses)for first 10 years (varies between companies but AIA one is disgustingly high.2. Yup  fund management fees are the one is standard across all funds  whether through broker or FA. The lowest is at 0.3-2.5% and highest is at 1.5%-3%.,btohqsg
Renovation loan is one of the most expensive loan you can take. I'll just take personal loan if i were you,btohqsg
Umm.. sorry ask a stupid question.. the incremental fresh funds mean every month need to put in? Or just 1 time would be sufficient.,btohqsg
Hi  TC Have you read the TnC? There are more criteria you need to fulfill other than incremental fresh fund. Don‚Äôt kena trap without reading TnC. Few members already missed the promo although placed incremental fresh fund into the account.,btohqsg
I read a few times but confused by it.. haha.. that's why asking..,btohqsg
1. What's your end day balance in all your UOB accounts total on 30 Sep? This balance will be (A).2. Deposit 50k/100k/200k into the desired account and register participation. The amount deposited will be (B).3. Maintain earmarked amount for 4 months (the current period will end on 15 April 2024). Earmarked amount will be (A) + (B)  cannot fall below this amount.,btohqsg
Tqtq sir I am new to UOB,btohqsg
This will be easier  because if you got no UOB accounts on 30 Sep  they reference you to $0.,btohqsg
"""everything will be lesser""- you sure? AIA ownself say no",btohqsg
Are you able to hit $500 or $600 minimum spend on eligible uob credit card every month? Also needs to credit salary to uob one account.,btohqsg
Means 20%++ of premium goes into insurance company and agent?,btohqsg
Nothing new. Every month also need to pay supplementary charge. üôä,btohqsg
I meant your own policy value will be lesser ü§£,btohqsg
I wonder if insurance agents explain this part to customers. 20% is quite a lot.,btohqsg
Yes disgustingly high. Other companies also charge but is way lesser ü´† that's why I'm determined to free look. This is applied on top of policy value also  which includes bonuses all.,btohqsg
Yeap would be able to hit. Thanks for the reminder. Tqtq üôèüôè,btohqsg
Remember the amount cannot drop lower than earmarked...,btohqsg
disgusting.. so over 10-15 years... it is ABOUT$14k / $66k = 21% of total premiums paid being sucked out as COMMISSION BY INSURANCE AGENT,btohqsg
