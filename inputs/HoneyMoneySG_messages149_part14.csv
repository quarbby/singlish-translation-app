Is Money deducted from your credit card?,btohqsg
Since when this transaction is general immediate rejected.,btohqsg
U can saw the cancel time is same with the initiated on.,btohqsg
Then nobody pay for this transfer unless you have money in the ewallet. Likely Instarem needs to pay for this if the transaction is successful. Correct?,btohqsg
Different date n time. Morning n night time.,btohqsg
No  my e-wallet without any amount.,btohqsg
Haha  i saw it. Hahaha. But I check with them then say cancel immediately and i check with my cc also no this transaction.,btohqsg
My understanding is after the transfer request is initiated  you need to download the Paynow QR from Amaze and use banks apps to scan the Paynow QR to transfer money from your bank account to Amaze account.,btohqsg
can put back into OA through voluntary housing refund if you used your OA for buying property.,btohqsg
But this not done by me.,btohqsg

Only worth it if u cannot generate 2.5% pa on your outside cash,btohqsg
Ya. That is why can be cancelled.,btohqsg

I find it quite funny how yall are still trying to understand. Probably Amaze CSO also cannot understand  so just suspended as a precaution,btohqsg

Below is my guess based on info provided.Likely OP Instarem account had been hacked  and hacker tried to bank transfer (send) to steal the money. However  in SG  need to use Instarem system generated Paynow QR code to transfer money from bank account to OP Instarem account. Since hacker can‚Äôt access OP bank account to complete the Paynow. The transaction did not completed n was cancelled subsequently after it was discovered.,btohqsg

i checked on Amaze and it‚Äôs MCC 7230 but I‚Äôm not sure if it earns 4mpd,btohqsg
How are you paying? If it‚Äôs mobile contactless  you can get 4mpd. For PPV  if you paywave  and the mcc is not in blacklist  it will be eligible for bonus.,btohqsg
Yes then you will get 4mpd,btohqsg
I asked as heymax stated 0.4mpd ü§® but hey thanks ü§©,btohqsg
Using heymax needs to specify payment method for the most accurate result.,btohqsg

FRSSARABHS MAOA go OASA go SAMA go OARA see below:Upon the closure of the Special Account (SA) for CPF members aged 55 and above in early 2025  the CPF contributions allocated to SA will be fully allocated to the member‚Äôs Retirement Account (RA)  up to the Full Retirement Sum (FRS).
