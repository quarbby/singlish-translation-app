Hi  for the UOB pot of gold promotion  if I empty my account today  and register then bank in on March  can or not? Thanks,btohqsg
Hello I have a question on CPFOA investment account related question. I opened a CPFOA investment account in OCBC… last week I first time used OA to buy Amundi USA on POEMS  then I realize by investing $100  my CPFOA deducted $102.73.. I called OCBC to ask if that 2.73 is their charge  then they told me it is the cost which CPF charged and OCBC will charge me $2 every quarter for each of my holding regardless whether I have any transaction in that quarter or not. Does that mean going forward if I want to buy Amundi through DCA  each transaction CPF will deduct some $$ and then quarterly I will be charged by OCBC also. Does anyone have clear idea on all the relevant charges for CPFOA investment? Thanks!!,btohqsg
It never mention that CPF will deduct $$ when I take out right? So is that each time 2.73?,btohqsg
each transaction (buy/sell) has a costeach quarter holding has a cost per counter as well,btohqsg
need to empty in Dec 2024,btohqsg
Ah ok. Thanks! So each transaction will have this CPF charge and each quarter the cost per counter is by the bank.. so it makes more sense to buy a bigger sum each time when I take $$ out from CPFOA right?,btohqsg
All fees are charged by agent bank  CPF don't charge anything. If you buy bigger sum the charges will be the same as smaller sum. You have to account for your investment strategy  whether you willing/able to invest more one shot or not.It will be the best if you can change to UOB  as they charge the least. Can just approach UOB physical branch and ask them you want to open new CPF-IA with them and transfer all existing investments tracked on OCBC CPF-IA to them. Remember to update all your investment brokers on the change in CPF-IA account number.,btohqsg
Any way to buy capital land voucher n still can earn miles/cashback n hit eligible spend,btohqsg

NERF 🚨 Instarem Amaze massive change from 10 Mar 2025!🚨- Instarem Amaze Code: HONEYMONEYhttps://hmsg.link/amazeBig changes are coming to Amaze from 10 March 2025:👎 1% Fee on ALL SGD Transactions- Previously applied only after S$1 000/month  now from the first dollar spent.👎 No More InstaPoints for Linked Card Spend- Only Amaze wallet-funded transactions will earn 0.5 IPs per S$1.👎 InstaPoints Cashout Removed- No more cashback redemptions. Instead  InstaPoints can be converted to KrisFlyer miles at a poor rate of 1 200 IPs = 400 miles.👍 Higher Amaze Wallet Limits- Increased to S$15 000 balance & S$75 000 annual spend.👍 Wallet Transfers to Bank Accounts Enabled- Cash-out option for wallet balances.What is broken- Citi Rewards x Instarem Amaze combo for no min spend SGD card strategyWhat is not broken (but weakened)- Foreign currency payments with amaze-linked card- 0.5% InstaPoints removed- But still reduces normal FCY fee to around 2.5% markup (Compared to banks rate)💡 What to Do Now?✅ Redeem InstaPoints for cashback before 10 March 2025.✅ Consider using Chocolate Card for FCY spend 🍫https://hmsg.link/chocolate✅ Apply and use alternative cards for local SGD spend.Some examples include:- Maybank Family & Friendshttps://hmsg.link/maybankfnf- UOB ONEhttps://hmsg.link/uobonevisa- UOB Preferred Platinum Visa/VISA Signature- DCS Flex VISAhttps://hmsg.link/dcsflexWhich is already part of my credit card strategy in 2025Video:https://youtu.be/14_WlT1Vx6oIs Amaze still worth using after these changes?- Wait for my full video for my opinion👉 Discuss morehttps://t.me/honeymoneysg👉 More referralhttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg
Is it a goodbye to Citi reward too :/,btohqsg
citi rewards still good for online and some fashion mcc,btohqsg
Hi all  for the additional 0.50% on first $25K in respect of CIMB fast saver - can we self initiate a salary crediting transaction from another bank ? Thanks,btohqsg
So for miles chaser  may i ask what will be the best replacement of 4mpd for crmc x amaze? I benefit greatly this combo on dining and groceries.,btohqsg
I have inconsistent spending on credit cards. Sometimes can hit 500 other months no.. what cards to use now?😢,btohqsg
For those asking for a new miles alternativehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/266903,btohqsg

Hi people who use CMC invest is it always their policy that dividends will only be paid to your account up to 2 weeks after the company issues them? To my knowledge other brothers like tiger and moomoo don’t do that? Thanks!,btohqsg
Hey all.. do you all know the reason apart from income  on getting rejected for CIMB Visa Infinite?,btohqsg
i asked for a credit limit lower than my current limit. Application got stuck for a while due to this.,btohqsg
Is it still recommended to keep Amaze card? The additional 1% charge is not worth right?,btohqsg
If you only use for local then no point. It’s still good for overseas spend.,btohqsg
What's good for local spend then now,btohqsg
For Standard Chartered Smart Card  is it still good to keep after 31/3? As the 6% rebate will be gone 😭,btohqsg
not good unless u have high spending on the specific merchants,btohqsg
Thanks a lot  guys. Planning to cancel some cards now :(,btohqsg
depends on what you will spend on :),btohqsg
Having 310k citi points. What to do with them,btohqsg
transfer them before they expire :D,btohqsg
if it is mostly dining etc. then UOB lady's is good - 6 mpd if you have a lady's savings account with 10k balance  otherwise 4 mpd,btohqsg
I still got like 2years before they expire,btohqsg
Same lol how many point u have,btohqsg
I have it for travel. Another other card. I have Chocolate Visa Card. Planning to get 1 other,btohqsg
need help too  need no min.spend for mobile contactless/apple pay payments and dont mind if there's a cap. miles chaser too. i alrdy have uob ppv,btohqsg
Honestly I still don't understand ppv miles how they calculate,btohqsg
it's in blocks of $5 so if u spend $8 or $5 u still get the same UNI$ points,btohqsg
Like this compare to rewards amaze not worth it right,btohqsg
1% fee min $0.50. for $8 spend 0.5/8 is 6.25% leh  in this case amaze+crmc totally not worth,btohqsg
Hold up!!!! They ended the citi rewards+ Amaze combination 😭,btohqsg
CIMB tends to look at your approved limits outside CIMB..so if you have a lot of credit cards approved at other banks already  CIMB might not feel comfortable,btohqsg
I mean if example I spend $8 with uob cards on dining How many miles do I earn or lose out compare to i spend $8 on citi rewards amaze before the nerf,btohqsg
should compare after the nerf right?,btohqsg
UOB $8 will be round down to $5  so $5 x 4miles= 20CRMC $8 x 4miles = 32,btohqsg
No i just wanna know before the nerf.  So no matter what not worth it for the 1% fee,btohqsg
ok  not much value though since nerf coming soon,btohqsg
I always thought there will be like 0.4 miles for the remaining 3 dollars. So that's not the case?,btohqsg
Don’t think so  just block of $5,btohqsg
That’s always the negative side of UOB  but bo bian,btohqsg

In this video  I’ll share how I reached $300K before turning 30  following a structured approach through corporate earnings  side hustles  and investing.,btohqsg
I just got both the cards 😭,btohqsg
not for ppv  for uob VS still get 3.6mpd,btohqsg
CRMC is still safe and a good card to use  just that have to be online,btohqsg
Looks like I gotta use more of shopback and kris + with my citi rewards,btohqsg
ah so it means amaze and crmc -> will have 1% fee now is it,btohqsg
I think Kris + still need go through amaze to get 4mpd ?,btohqsg
kris+ cannot use crmc direct btw,btohqsg
For local physical transaction  yes sadly,btohqsg
So if we use shopback with crmc will it still earn citi points?,btohqsg
but only the 1x not 10x right,btohqsg
crmc cannot use with apple pay just take note don’t forget,btohqsg
If we look at a smaller scale $100 equivalent to paying $1   the 1% doesnt look too big . 😅,btohqsg
Yup  I agree too  will still going to use the CRMC/Amaze combo,btohqsg
applepay in-app no 10x points  applepay contactless still get 10x points for some fashion mccs,btohqsg
Unless individual spent $1000 on physical spent,btohqsg
+ its 4mpd still and the MCC covers almost everything except for travel/hotel,btohqsg
Precisely  covers mostly everything on daily to daily stuff.Maybe hoop on EGA to pay the CC bill to offset the 1% fee ?,btohqsg
but need to be min 50 or close to that,btohqsg
But why not just use UOB PPV?,btohqsg
citi rewards points more valuable maybe lol,btohqsg
Think have to be aware of the $5 blocks,btohqsg
if doing min $50  $5 blocks not so significant,btohqsg
Agree  really depend on the amount ba,btohqsg
Btw.  Anyone try using NTUC app for payment and pair with citi reward  does it still give you 4mpd ? 😅,btohqsg
So it’s up to individual spending,btohqsg
Thanks … at least still useful in a way,btohqsg
the point is $5 block is less of an issue than 1% min $0.50 fees,btohqsg
M1/Singtel bill  can link CRMC and get 10x points when we pay the monthly bill?,btohqsg
How about using Amex True Cashback? 1.5%. Does it works on CapitaStar voucher purchase?,btohqsg
singtel need to pay on their website not app,btohqsg
Looking forward to Chris’ video update/reaction on this 😂,btohqsg
Ahh then crmc wouldnt be an issue to post it as an online transaction i guess.,btohqsg
Well unless my understanding is incorrect  this means that i still can earn 4mpd at Kopitiam using NTUC app for payment and pair with citi reward? 😅,btohqsg
Will Citi reward points expire if you don’t redeem them?,btohqsg
yes after 3 years  I thinkEdit: apparently 5 years  read message below,btohqsg
expire 5 years+3months from card approval and every 5 years thereafter,btohqsg
yes if link citi rewards directly to fairprice app (not via google/apple pay in app),btohqsg
If it is considered as online,btohqsg
Is there a good reason to keep cash in UOB stash or better in MMF or cash management funds?,btohqsg
One is saving account with capital guaranteed and the other is not,btohqsg
True. The stable funds should be good growth for passive income. The digital bank rates are attractive too,btohqsg
Hi all  with the recent amaze nerf coming  what else can crmc be used for on a daily basis?I know we can use the following for the bonus:1. Fairprice (app payment using crmc direct instead of Samsung pay/Apple pay)2. Shopback (app payment using crmc direct instead of Samsung pay/Apple pay)3. Favepay (app payment using crmc direct instead of Samsung pay/Apple pay)Anything else that can be used?,btohqsg
Anybody take a long time to receive the choc finance card? Wonder if its lost in the mail,btohqsg
Crmc + amaze after nerf thoughts: the online transaction still looks good since rounding off is based on $1. Up 5 years expiry of points still fit in well for those needing Abit more time. Indeed it has lost it attractiveness than before but it still serve some target users. However personally I’m looking at this chance to also align another uob card to match with uob lady card to reset citi new to bank status.,btohqsg
So far no good options for card spending below 5 dollars?,btohqsg
I guess the closest is the Chocolate visa,btohqsg
So now crmc + amaze is 3.96mpd? (If we stick to 1k spend),btohqsg
it's 1% of your notional spend as a FEEnot 1% of your benefit,btohqsg
how much do you value miles at  deduct $10 worth of miles off 4k miles,btohqsg
3 - 3.33mpd. depending on your miles valuation and whether it's below $50,btohqsg
But it's a debit card right?,btohqsg
If mostly fly SQ then CF is out?,btohqsg
Heymax is out  you mean but I guess that was the only use for the CF,btohqsg
Can also use directly on Shopee and Lazada goods purchases rite?,btohqsg
But you could always book sq tickets through Alaska etc.,btohqsg
Another issue is that now have to self monitor the S$1000 statement monthly spend. There is no other channel to monitor the S$1000 spend for CRMC rite?,btohqsg
But if want to accumulate and fly sq cannot use CF?,btohqsg
not many non-KF star alliance 😁,btohqsg
Guys is automatic trading bots worth the effort,btohqsg
Chris gives me the feeling of trust  very direct and blunt on certain things 😂,btohqsg
Hi just to check if have gym membership that auto deduct monthly not consider online payment right?,btohqsg
Not all SQ flights can redeem via their third partner. Especially if you want to redeem for business class seat or in Asia region,btohqsg
I thought I saw some blogs talking about that being a way to book tickets on sq that sometimes appear waitlisted,btohqsg
For citi rewards card  does paying with it through Google pay  considered as online transaction?,btohqsg
now im so lost... idk what card to replace citi reward,btohqsg
crmc no 4mpd for kris+ cos it is through apple/google pay in-app,btohqsg
ohh!! so i need to bind my card directly to the app  instead of using thru apple pay (eg shopback directly to crmc),btohqsg
I think it’s still useful for Apple users through Kris+ amaze crmc to hit the monthly Mastercard rebates,btohqsg
Actually  how do you check which transaction gets you 4mpd on Citi rewards?,btohqsg
You can compare but my view is SQ does not allow all their flights to be available via their partner airline portal,btohqsg
Hi All  just wanted to confirm if auto deduction is considered an offline transaction?,btohqsg
Hi all  OCBC 360 spend interest rate 500sgd minimum spend has no conflict with MCC that eligible for cashback right? or it both share the same exclusion?,btohqsg
Hi all  DCS Ultimate Platinum Mastercard can earn 2% cashback on mrt/bus ?,btohqsg
Can grab  tada  gojek  cdgzip use with crmc for 4mpd reward? Thanks.,btohqsg
Eva air is not available on heymax. Yet.Aeroplan is available though.,btohqsg
Hi. I have about 100K in OA (no use for it) and wish to DCA my OA into Amundi Prime.What fees should I consider when deciding whether to DCA each time  or simply invest a lump sum?,btohqsg
If i take a bank loan for a big purchase ($3k)  and split it into installment of maybe each month payable amount around $150. Will that statement month calculate it as $150 or $3k? Coz my worry is that it exceed the cap amount of $1k.,btohqsg
Not many SQ flights that we can book through Aeroplan especially for flights in Asia region,btohqsg
Instalment won't earn rewards so won't count to ur 1k cap,btohqsg
Ahh i see. Thanks for clearing that up!,btohqsg

Sorry for noob question but if I used naked CRMC to buy off a website  should count as online right?Are there websites that are not considered online?,btohqsg
Anyone think it's still worth using citi rewards and amaze combo with the new fees from amaze?,btohqsg
I like how we are struggling with this since this could be the new usage case for CRMC 😊Just shop online mostly and just Fave  Shopee etcReally narrows the usage case compared to with Amaze but still not hopeless,btohqsg
maybe still worth if redeeming miles to some valuable mileage program,btohqsg
Eight mobile and SIMBA auto deduct will count as online for naked CRMC?,btohqsg
Watch ur fee. If the amount above 50$  its 1%. The pct is higher if the amount is smaller due to min 0.5$,btohqsg
I recommend buying credits from shopee w crmc instead. Sometimes can get discounts.,btohqsg
My calculation for revised amaze crmc $1000 spendReward = 4000 miles x 1.5 cents = $60Fee = 1% of $1000 = $10 and that’s assuming you spend everything above $50 per transactionNet benefit = $50 / 1.5 cents = 3 333 milesTherefore amaze + crmc = 3.33 miles per dollar benefit after 10th March 2025.,btohqsg
Hello! New to the miles game hence appreciate all advice. I am expecting wedding expenses in the upcoming month. UOB PRIV miles have the promo for up to 58k miles.

medium purchase. too small  high % amaze charge. too large  exceed CRMC cap. not easy 😆,btohqsg
so my understanding is correct of min 50 cents  eg i need to charge 50 dollars min at a time for it to be 1% charge?,btohqsg
anything below is not even 1 % but higher?,btohqsg
yup as long as card-linked local transactions,btohqsg

Hi  say on heymax recommended me to use UOB Absolute Cashback Card for my upcoming cruise trip. Would just like to check because the absolute cashback card has a 3.25% foreign currency fee but still a 1.7% cashback  so meaning i will be charged 3.25% on how much i spend and also cashback 1.7% on how mych i spent too right? Because the cashback doesnt take into account the fees.Also 1.7% cashback on overseas spend is on all category?With this  do you guys think its worthwhile still using absolute cashback on the cruise or will i be better off with my youtrip/amaze wallet?,btohqsg
How much are u spending for this cruise?,btohqsg
Dont really plan to spend but just in case,btohqsg
Mhmm does it have foreign fee? If so how much?,btohqsg
Hi.. I just starting using Amaze + citi rewards combo for a month now. Now that amaze is no longer a good option  what’s the best available option for me? Because there is a limitation to what transaction works for Citi rewards right?,btohqsg
Hi all ! Going to Japan soon   can I check what’s the card viable for rewards for topping up virtual suica card ? Does UOB VS still works ?,btohqsg
i still use Youtrip/travel cards  i calculated the FCF not worth vs the exchange rate different vs mainstream bank CC.,btohqsg
CRMC will just become an online-preferred card. There are UOB PPV  VS and Lady's for paywave all are 4mpd but with caveats to each of them.,btohqsg
Uob vs  uob ppv  hsbc revo  dbs wwmc.May need to uplift security before topping up,btohqsg
If cannot meet the min $1k spend for VS  then PPV still a better option right?,btohqsg
i see i see. so PPV is quite good for day to day transaction. i will look into it. thanks for the recommendation,btohqsg
Just want to confirm that’s the case even though it’s a recurring payment from SIMBA? 😅,btohqsg
Which cruise? If not interested in miles  youtrip/amaze wallet/trust are lowest in overall expense. CIMB Visa Signature has 10% for cruise but with $800 min spend and it's just not an attractive card standalone. UOB Evol  OCBC Frank  DBS Livefresh can give positive cashback but you must see if worth it or not.,btohqsg
Note PPV will rounddown each transaction to nearest $5 block before calculating miles  normal $10-20 payments still acceptable but lower than 4mpd,btohqsg
ooof i guess i have a lot of studying to do,btohqsg
based on datapoints of wwmc it is online not so sure about crmc cos some transactions that are online may end up not being online on citi rewards card,btohqsg
This is misleading  if you scroll down a bit  you realise that OP wrongly used the heymax estimated value for this calculation instead of the value actually charged to the choco card,btohqsg
Hi all. I heard that there will be bonus point having uob ladies savings pair with uob ladys card. If men cant open uob ladies savings  can we get our wife to open it and benefit from it?,btohqsg

Did you use axs app or the physical machine? Did you freeze your choco card? Unfreeze card  use app  choose “credit card” option on app. Ensure your choco account got enough money since it’s a debit card afterall.,btohqsg
U have to choose credit card then other bank visa,btohqsg

Hi 👋 folks. New in this chat but watching HMSG from long time now. I switched to mile chasing last year with HSBC Revo and nerfed  just got Crmc+amaze and immediately neefed. I have started to think that mile chasing has become a high spenders game. Also  since new cashback cards coming in from everywhere  is it really a good idea to switch to cashback chasing?,btohqsg

Hi all can I confirm on my UOB pot of gold registration:28Feb: sign up on PoG registration form28Feb: deposit 150K29Mar: funds will be earmarkedSo from 1Mar onwards  I can get the bonus interest  with $500 card spend + $1600 salary (edited) in March  correct?,btohqsg
You still need salary crediting in Mar for the bonus interest.How much was your MAB in Dec? Or simply put  is your account in Dec at $0 for the whole month?,btohqsg
Oh yes thanks  I’ve edited my post to include salary. Actually I’m doing this for my mom. Just applied UOB one acct for her this morning online 😅 she has about $3k+ sitting in UOB uniplus account . That counts into MAB ya?,btohqsg
Should I then deposit $155K instead? To take into account the 3k+ sitting in her uniplus account?,btohqsg
For uob ppv  to get 4mpd i just need to use mobile contactless for offline payment right? Means just use apple pay will allow me in getting the bonus point?,btohqsg
If scared then put 155k.. assuming she will touch the amounts in her UOB Uniplus account but not in the UOB One account.,btohqsg

Sorry if this seemed like a noob qn but does collecting UOB UNI$ for miles seemed better than citi points since it converts 5k : 10k miles while citi is 25k : 10k . ?,btohqsg
the question is rather how much money does it take to get these? that would make this comparison make sense,btohqsg
Can i say it’s how the 4mpd is being translated into their points that makes it look like UOB is much achievable than Citi points?,btohqsg
what do you mean by achievable? Both earn 4mpd if you use them the right way. End results for both sides are very similar.,btohqsg
Maybe im just enticed by the small number,btohqsg

Call in to wavie everytime they charge late fees. Just received the card   activate then on the same day have unauthorized transaction  really no confidence on Maybank.,btohqsg
Are u get back the fund? How long u get back the fund?,btohqsg

I dun have hsbc ega. When I went to applied on Jan  they told me I'm not entitled for the bonus interest anymore.,btohqsg

I’m trying to shortlist a general spend miles card for transactions less than $50 after the amaze nerf takes effect. I’ve narrowed down to dbs altitude and citi premiermiles since their miles don’t expire -has anyone used either/both of them and can share your experienceswith them  along with factors that could possibly compel someone to use one over the other? The only thing I can think of at the moment is if I book anything on Agoda  then dbs altitude being a Visa card will let me avoid the extra 1% charge,btohqsg
UOB KF waving at you 😁,btohqsg
What are other cards that you own?,btohqsg
Uob: one  lady’s  ppv  kf  prvimilesScb: simply cashAmex: tcb  kf blueTrust: cashbackThe cashback cards are mostly from before I switched to miles,btohqsg
Why don’t use you use PriviMiles for general spending so the pools can pool?,btohqsg
The small transactions that don’t fall nicely within $5 blocks will be tricky,btohqsg
I'd do UOB ppv for above 5$. Anything below 5$ that cannot be covered by UOB lady I'd use cashback card. Not worth using miles card for such expenses.,btohqsg
So visa signature is only good for foreign transactions ?,btohqsg
Contactless in terms of paywave only right ?,btohqsg
For <$5  can consider Chocolate Visa for now. 2mmpd and Max Miles have no expiry.Personally Citi not allowing pooling is a hassle to manage.And starting DBS collection doesn’t simplify things for you.,btohqsg
Yep. It's official definition from uob.,btohqsg
True  it would take a long time to earn the miles on those small transactions,btohqsg

HSBC credit card points seem to have been significantly reduced. The 9X points awarded do not appear to match expectations.,btohqsg

I signed up HSBC EGA promo for Feb & March. The bonus interest will be given out on 31 May.  Since today is 1 March  technically I have earned the bonus interest for Feb. If I were to transfer everything out and maintain only required minimum balance of 2K  will the bonus interest for Feb be forfeited? Going through the T&C  I didnt find anything on this. Can anyone advise? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
If person has personal & joint.Person register for joint account first month  2nd month register for personal.If registered account with current promo cannot be overwrited.Then it is possible to do;Joint:Mar - fund in (register 3mth)Apr - fund outMay - fund inPersonal:Apr - fund in (register 3 mth)May - fund outJun - fund inContinue toJoint:Jul - fund in (register 3mth)Aug - fund outSep - fund inPersonal:Aug - fund in (register 3mth)Sep - fund outOct - fund inRepeat 🔁 until HSBC bankruptsDoes this work?Considering past history suggest account that's been registered with current promotion will run until finished campaign.So joint registration does not affect personal registration.Where is Mt???,btohqsg
In my case  I can safely expect to receive the Feb bonus interests in 31 May then? Thanks for confirming.,btohqsg
Anyone know how to do this registration on app? I can't find on my app,btohqsg
Too complicated. I only do all individual names,btohqsg

IMO trust cashback is better as you have additional 1-15% cashback on your spend,btohqsg
i see! good pointpublic transport and online travel i can just switch the uob ladys category by the quarter i guess,btohqsg
Joint registration very risky. You don't know when they decide to change something again then end up void either one of your registration.,btohqsg
any news regarding hsbc live+ bonus 8% cashback period? will they extend past march 2025?,btohqsg
The problem is there's a clause that defines fresh funds as only those that are not withdrawn from any hsbc accounts in the user's name in the last 30 days. It doesn't say this is not applicable to joint accounts. Whether this rule is enforced  I'm also interested to know.,btohqsg
Yeah. Guess best to just split up the mess.,btohqsg
HSBC want to tell us don't be funny.They also know it's hard to enforce.But they want to say something nevertheless.,btohqsg
It's not hard to enforce. CPF is already using a similar rule. Just a matter if anyone tracked closely enough to see if their system captures this.,btohqsg
They won't do until like that  unless it's very clear cut...So far they have been paying the interest.,btohqsg
yup  no issues. you can xfer the money out,btohqsg
It's easier to enforce CPF one because it's a single month and single account reference while UOB/HSBC one slightly harder because it spans across multiple months and multiple accounts.,btohqsg
Hi  I heard that 10 Mar onwards Instarem Amaze card will incur 1% for all SGD transactions instead of fee waiver below $1000. How will it affect on me using CitiReward accumulating points to redeem miles if I choose not to use Amaze and avoid paying for that 1%?,btohqsg
Not being able to use citi rewards offline in Singapore anymore?,btohqsg
You only can spend certain transactions online and certain transactions contactless in SGD depending on the whitelist. Check t&c to find out.,btohqsg
Ok i was wrong. Citi rewards has a list of shopping mcc that still can do offline. Still  usage of citi rewards offline is limited now.,btohqsg
To be fair  you can still use Amaze & Citi rewards in selective situations. This is different from the current situation where you can use this combo for almost all situations. This is the give and take. Think first before you decide what card to use in a given situation.,btohqsg
For my use  I will be using UOB PPV to cover local dinning and shopping. For online  I will use CRMC. For oversea spending  I will still use Amaze+CRMC. There are special situations that I may still use Amaze+CRMC like for large items that allow to earn substantial points which I feel outweigh the cost of local fees.  But have to see case by case.,btohqsg
The 10gb apac is only available there?,btohqsg

Now that amaze is nerf  is it possible to use atome as an alternative with Citi reward? What is the cons of using it?,btohqsg
It seems sometimes Citi doesn't award bonus miles for atome transaction. Various dp of yes and no so I don't know it's good idea to use,btohqsg
At own risk. Sometimes 4mpd sometimes 0.4mpd. No guarantees.,btohqsg
Which is a better platform for higher returns   moomoo  stashaway or chocolate? Funds 100  000,btohqsg

Can the chocolate card be used for  overseas spending without incurring additional overseas transaction fee  just like Youtrip card ?Or chocolate card got additional fee if used overseas,btohqsg
So it's as good as youtrip or trust card ?,btohqsg
I didn't read clearly if it is inside their white list but pelago is on kris+ of you like to maximise the miles.,btohqsg
Using krisflyer uob for eg  will i get the 3 miles per $1?,btohqsg

Would like to ask a noob question. For UOB PRVI  it state Every S$1 spend will earn you1.4 miles(UNI$3.5 per S$5 spend) on local spend. So it mean will earn UOB uni$ equivalent of 1.4mile when I spend S$1 or that I need spend $5 to earn the equivalent rate of 1.4mile per $1? For the $5 is it based on total spending for the statement month or per transaction? Was late to join the mile chaser game using UOB card.,btohqsg
Alipay is good for all payment in China. I used it for all payment in SZ and GZ at a breeze,btohqsg

Since there is nerd of crmc+ amaze. It is still worth to use this card? Currently  I using UOB priv paying rental  UOB one card cover my utility and transportation and other spending in order to hit$500 per month. For crmc  I charging the SingTel bill and after I hit the UOB one credit card. Should I get another credit card like UOB ppv?,btohqsg
I mean paying 1% fee and minimum charge 50 to crmc+ amaze. Currently  my crmc charging around 400-500 per month and 70% is my telco bill,btohqsg
use naked citi rewards card pay directly on singtel website (not app),btohqsg
ya. will do this. another i thinking to pay the 1% fee for my other purchases if the amount is more than 50. since normally my crmc didnt charge much amount.,btohqsg
For Mayank Family and Friends  SingTel bill payment via SingTel app is eligible for 8% under ‘Data communication’ category?,btohqsg
since you spend so much on singtel can consider yuu,btohqsg
not really  cos current bill charging the phone installment  so will be slightly higher. back to normal will be like 100 plus per month.,btohqsg
i just saw  the yuu card need to have spend around 600 per month  no that much of expense charge to new card already.,btohqsg
if it is online or whitelisted mcc can charge to citi rewards card direct. If other offline spend more than $50 and u not spending on other 4mpd cards or value citi rewards points more than other bank miles then can use crmc.,btohqsg
normally  now i charge one credit card first  then crmc  then after max up crmc  all charge to uob priv,btohqsg
consider use ppv instead of prvi to get 4mpd instead of 1.4mpd but need $5 blocks,btohqsg
ya. i see the whilelist seem cover much on the cloth store but not the restaurant. so why i thinking to apply ppv or not.,btohqsg
ppv mobile contactless work on blacklist  anything get 4mpd so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg

Last qn  will the purchase made with installment count in the minimum $800 to spend in the first year qualify for 3mpd for dining shopping etc?,btohqsg

Hi  will like some advice. I need to pay about 5K at Volkswagen Service Centre. Don't think they have any online payment choices.I dont have the premium cards like HF  Vantage  CitiPrestige. Will my best bet be cards like TCB for 1.5% cashback  or DBS Altitude for 1.3mpd?,btohqsg
yes cos the conversion rate of the merchant likely is lousy,btohqsg
Can I check which brokage house has the lowest overall fee currently ( platform fee  commission fee etc ) ?,btohqsg

Hello all  I have been using CRMC with amaze to pay for my GIGA phone bill. But now that Amaze is going to charge 1%. What are the alternative?Is it possible to make payment with CRMC before the recurring payment is triggered?,btohqsg
try use crmc for the recurring bill  should be processed as online,btohqsg
Previously have seen others saying that recurring payment will be a different MCC. And will not earn 4mpd.That's why I used amaze.,btohqsg
Good morning  first time user of AxS here to pay property and income tax. Can I ask experienced users when do you usually make payment and do you use a combo of AXS and automated giro?,btohqsg
someone did recommended switching toUOB PRVI Miles Visa Card. i was wondering whats the difference between this and Citi PremierMiles Card on their usage,btohqsg
when is a good time to close a credit card after receiving the sign up bonus? Applied for CRMC in Dec for the $500 cashback and planning to close it. Is there a time period to close so there is no negative impact? (harder to apply next time  lowered credit score),btohqsg
Can you provide more context of that recommendation? Dont seem to make sense to make that switch.,btohqsg
Actually can we use CRMC directly for GIGA? Since its an online transaction?,btohqsg
Hi all  if i alr did 2k/5k n 5 transactions in feb for hsbc ega. Received sms confirmation for feb n march. Do i still need to do in n out inMarch again? TIA,btohqsg
because all these while Amaze + Citi Rewards combo was meant for day to day local spending. and UOB PPV also earns you points on paywave. that is how i understand it. Below was the reply i got when i asked for an alternative for day to day card.CRMC will just become an online-preferred card. There are UOB PPV  VS and Lady's for paywave all are 4mpd but with caveats to each of them.If cannot meet the min $1k spend for VS  then PPV still a better option right?,btohqsg
From what I know  recurring payment will be a different mcc so will not earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
Anyone have not gotten the 1% fee yet?,btohqsg
Ok you replied to a question about using crmc on giga bills and asked about crmc vs uob prvi miles visa. Thats confusing for sure.UOB PPV is a decent alternative for offline spendings  as long as you are aware of its quirks  like $5 spend block.,btohqsg
No 1% fee if under $1k as of now,btohqsg
Whats this instapoint redemption? Is it for wallet only,btohqsg
Because you didn't use the merchant with MCC4111 or MCC6540Correct?,btohqsg
so basically PPV is only for transaction more than $5 right?,btohqsg
Hi can i check what is the best mile card to use for travel purchase like hotel bookings.Can uob ppv earn 4mpd for website like agoda/trip.com?,btohqsg
Hi anyone encounter issue not able to waive UNI$ annual fee for UOB lady’s card? The self serve system said can’t waive and CS agent also said not allowedAny suggestions what to do?,btohqsg
UOB lady travel category or dbs wwmc if booking from OTA.,btohqsg
sorry for askingmore questions.. cause you seem to know a lot haha.now i will completely forget about my Citi Rewards and look for a new card.looking at the perks by PPV  since i will also make a few trips every year  i believe this automatically becomes my first choice?Other than that would be Citi PremierMiles.cause im not so interested in cashback cards.and i believe UOB bank provides 6% saving interest when the criteria are hit right?,btohqsg
You are looking at the wrong card.There is UOB Preferred Platinum Visa and you are looking at UOB PRVI MilesAnd these cards dont qualify for UOB one saving account interest.,btohqsg
Thank you! ok now i am clear,btohqsg
so i still need to split into different cards depending on what i need and do,btohqsg
Strategies for income passive haven't changed for a long time. Maybe you need to be specific on what you want to ask about.,btohqsg

Hi all  can I check for ocbc 360  for MAB  its cut off at month end right? Meaning when its the new month  I won't need to maintain the $500 increase to obtain the interest for the month?,btohqsg
Or have to maintain all the way until interest in?,btohqsg
firstly u know what is MAB?,btohqsg
First step of passive income is to build the capital (whether money or asset). If you haven't figured the first step  passive income may be an illusion,btohqsg
MAB is based on daily cut off numbers,btohqsg
Passive income is not fully passive 😛 people need to realise that,btohqsg
When is daily cut off time for mdabHSBC bankUob bank,btohqsg
Oh uob one account i got less interest last month.... not sure is that they changed interest rates? No more 4% 150k max?,btohqsg
So after 1030pm can take out money and move to other banks,btohqsg
It is anyone’s guessUnless you work for the bank and is authorised to reveal such information as to when their system does the calculation and updates.Any timing given here are just anecdotal and just a guess.,btohqsg
gentle warning that if you game this too much u will get love letters...,btohqsg
Hi@ChrisHMSG  if I just create account for POEMS with intention to opt in SMART Park possible or must buy share as well?,btohqsg
Might be next business day already.,btohqsg
V trueAs mentioned anyone replying to timing here are just guessing 😊 based on anecdotal data.,btohqsg
Buy share is for the funding rewards. Smart park 5% is separate,btohqsg
Did you recieve? It's already March.. FYI I am also wating for the FEB payout.,btohqsg
did a little bit of research and currently looking into these. feels like a good reference,btohqsg
For me simply:UOB PPV - paywaveUOB VS - anything above 1k  e.g. spa package or overseasUOB PRVI - Gen spend  or overseas during 5mpd promoCiti Rewards + AMAZE - OverseasDBS Womans - OnlineUOB Ladys - travel spendUOB point pools  so it's helpful,btohqsg
Not me but I saw dbs already credited this for others,btohqsg
Idk where you got this chart from or if your research solely consisted of chatgpt  but you should be mindful that your this table contains minor inaccuracies (eg  dbs wwmc is capped at 1.5k and expires in 1 year),btohqsg
Is there any good cc for oversea hotel payment and also air ticket to earn mile?,btohqsg
UOB lady travel is the only one for all of these spends. Unless some funny japan hotels.,btohqsg
This is where I kindly ask you to research on the card itself.,btohqsg
you can consider using Maybank Horizon Visa Signature.Min $800 per calender month. 2.8mpd  sometimes higher when they run promos.,btohqsg
Thanks. But I looking for card for not minimum spend per month,btohqsg
heymax chocolate card 2 max miles per dollar first $1k per monthno min spend,btohqsg
by overseas hotel payment you mean you pay in-person at the hotel? or book and pay online?,btohqsg

Insurance company and iras have different systems. We don't know how their systems handle axs payments behind the scene.Usually people set up giro for tax payment so you have safety net if axs payment doesn't reach in time.,btohqsg

Yea I don't think there's any other 4mpd offline card that isn't in blocks of $5. So I may use Chocolate Finance unless it's above $50  then I'll use either PPV  Lady's or CRMC + Amaze.I may be mistaken  but I think Lady's card  as long as your spending is in the selected category  it can be below $5. And then at the end of the month it combines everything? Not sure if I'm right on that,btohqsg
What do u guys think of using ladys for dinning and transactions below $5 coupled with ppv for any other categories?To replace amaze + rewards,btohqsg
