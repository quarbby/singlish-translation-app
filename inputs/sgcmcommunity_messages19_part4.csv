7 consecutive weeks of falls has never been seen in modern days. Don’t play play.,btohqsg
Actually yes it is worth of money and don’t need take loan,btohqsg
Borrowing money to buy cars be careful. Do not get deep in debts,btohqsg
My wife always ask me buy a old car as don’t t need take loan,btohqsg
In 2018 when I accompanied my friend to test the Giulia  he immediately fell in love. But he needs to come up with 70k cash. It ain’t worth it. Today you. Can get a good used Giulia still with warranty for half that amount. The key is to control your urge.,btohqsg
I learned this hard lessons losing half of the value when I sold my car. I bought new.,btohqsg
After that I never bought new anymore,btohqsg
This sky high coe cannot sustain. It will fall.,btohqsg
Never lost la   when you sell cars you get back the money for the next purchase .Actually like you u said fianance wise best is to buy 5-6 years old car and don’t get loan,btohqsg
1995 coes also peaked. Then fell hard,btohqsg
I paid 144000 new and sold at 72000,btohqsg
Don’t get suckered into new cars,btohqsg
U put down 40% means u only loan 60% and the intreast is base on the 60% for the next 5 years if you loan for 5 years,btohqsg
Any bro advice on 08 WRX?,btohqsg
That is why ppl using the $0 drive away paying so much intreast,btohqsg
That’s not how you calculate you alway check how much you paid. And how much you got back,btohqsg
Thank .. due of service liao,btohqsg
If my loan is 5years I can depreciate among 5 heats   and car selling price is another thing,btohqsg
Yes cause car depreciation is very high for first 2 years,btohqsg
Calculate. How much you paid. And how much you get back. That’s it,btohqsg
There’s always a first time buying used. Be a man. Do it. You’ll appreciate how good this decision will turn out to be. After getting one used car I buy another and another,btohqsg
My previous car I down 80 k and loan 90 k   sell like 2 years plus and get back 90 k lol,btohqsg
My loan is 5 years   if I loan 3 years I get back more lol,btohqsg
Why so I loan 90 k does not mean I pay up 90 k,btohqsg
This ain’t worth it. Just my two cents. I’ve gone through this pain. So i shared with you all,btohqsg
That 90 k is on a full loan repayment schedule,btohqsg
How much is the car? How much did you sell. Simple,btohqsg
Have to go dig back liao I buy is 170 k,btohqsg
Banks won’t take losses. You take losses,btohqsg
Sell don’t really remember as I just trade in,btohqsg
I know ar that why I only loan 5 years,btohqsg
So you sold at 90k means you lost 80k,btohqsg
As ad said that the minimum,btohqsg
170 k is base on 5 years of loan plus down payment,btohqsg
I only drove 2 years plus and pay 2 years plus of down payment,btohqsg
So I buy the car at 170 k but I did not pay 170 k,btohqsg
Sure is lose money but not lose 80 k for 2 years la   if 80 k at 2 years my car depreciation is at 40 k liao,btohqsg
So how much you paid initially,btohqsg
And how much did you pay back bank to get back,btohqsg
That’s all I wanted to ask,btohqsg
I pay 132 k for like 2 years 10 month in total,btohqsg
Get back 90 k for my new car purchase and use it for down payment,btohqsg
And top up a little for current car,btohqsg
So my previous car depreciated 42 k for the 2 years 10 month lol,btohqsg
but will go up la. goodproduct.pluscapable founder with extraordinary track record,btohqsg

My other 2 etf drop more then tesla,btohqsg
I am just a working middle class,btohqsg
In HWZ they call me bbfa,btohqsg
Dealers will always undercut by ~5k or more on market value when you trade in,btohqsg
