Hi all  so I am currently a higher nitec yr2 student studying paramedic and emergency care. I am intending to apply to poly thru eae this way and my last gpa was 2.3 the thing I kinda wanted this course initially but now I have lost interest and I wanna switch to engineering in SP  may I know is it possible to apply to a unrelated course in poly and what are the chances of getting in?I have registered for 2 workshops (ITE CoC in Data Analytics using Excel and ITE CoC in Piloting in Unmanned Aircraft under 7kg) in relation to engineering in dip in aerospace electronics in SP however I am aiming to go for dip in common engineering programme as I am very unsure of this field and I wanna make sure I choose the right pathway for myself.Thanks all in advance :)),btohqsg
