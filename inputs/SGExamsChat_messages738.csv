maybe because the school genuinely sucks?,btohqsg
dont discount other peoples experiences lmao,btohqsg
imma put it this way. even good students from those schools wouldn't be so delusional for the most part to claim their school is amazing or whatnot. end of the day it comes down to whether they wanna use their resources given. but as an outsider  dogpiling and just jumping on the bandwagon of shitting on them is stupid,btohqsg
ik of 2 of my classmates in yijc,btohqsg
The only Yi friend I have at least can attest the sch is crap lol  cos students with bad results plus bad leadership,btohqsg
my friend in yijc alr mugging to get  70RP,btohqsg
The bad leadership part can also perpetuate the cycle of students with bad results. At the same time  itâ€™s possible that moe will just let things be status quo and not bother allocating more resources and better leaders to yi,btohqsg
ive also seen some guy from y3 ri talking about how theres people straight up fapping in his class,btohqsg
It's also one thing to flame Ur own sch cuz U would know what sup w Ur sch more,btohqsg
and hes from raffles  the students there are horrendous,btohqsg
its BOYS from INTEGRATED PROGRAM what do you expect,btohqsg
your flaming is just jumping on a bandwagon,btohqsg
Oh ya shit forgot the RI section is boys only,btohqsg
also their schools mostly suck because their a level reshtsare horrendously trash,btohqsg
since its only post jc students,btohqsg
to have done at least 3 months of GP,btohqsg
IP boys are either model student (100 ECs  class president  gold medal for IOI) or the most ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ people you'll meet (say n word in class  do weird shit to girls),btohqsg
so we should all be able to think rationally,btohqsg
Yo today my gp teacher not here,btohqsg
i genuinely dont get why ur metric for how good a sch is is just how well they do for a levels,btohqsg
you lump every single student in a school together  jump on a bandwagon to flame them  and go haha no offense xd,btohqsg
I should sell my gp exercises,btohqsg
hey this is what i do to vjc,btohqsg
wait let me show u dmth,btohqsg
ya you suck too it's ok,btohqsg
then the new students themselves believe they are just as bad as them and the cycle repeats,btohqsg
i heard from@phxrqthat somebody got rejected from such an easy combi because they didnt take a math or pure science. are you actually serious  you didnt take a math or pure science  and you want to do double science and h2 math? no wonder you got rejected,btohqsg
also i genuinely hope people know my vjc thing is a meme,btohqsg
i actually dont rly care abt vjc,btohqsg
i just dont like some students from thr,btohqsg
must be delusional to think you can do h2 double science and h2 math if you didn't even take a math or pure science.,btohqsg
gude that's a great sticker pack,btohqsg
what makes you think you can catch up,btohqsg
why is taking pure science a requirement for h2 double science,btohqsg
in EJ u can do h2 double science with combined science,btohqsg
yeah but you need A1 for that stuff,btohqsg
and my friends who did it got A for both their sciences,btohqsg
Iirc right the subj pre req for sci is actually just combined sci,btohqsg
my physics tutor say his best students are the combined science ppl,btohqsg
ya thats what i thought also,btohqsg
if you got rejected it means youre genuinely giving yourself too much high hopes,btohqsg
i dont know what shit you are talking about,btohqsg
this is what i would recommend my students to do also,btohqsg
"its better than""go read the news and find out what happened today""",btohqsg
i feel like comb sci ppl may put in more efforts to catch up so they more hardworking and its good also cause they not complacent,btohqsg
Afaik for combined chem the only real bridging they needed was for titration,btohqsg
just need see the comments she gave lor,btohqsg
also got ppl taking h2 math with no amath,btohqsg
It's not the end of the world,btohqsg
you will need to do a lot of catching up since h2 math is built on a math knowledge,btohqsg
Ngl as a teacher I rather have a student who isnt that good but ask me for consults everyday and tries even if they fail horribly then someone who calls ppl delusional for trying,btohqsg
I like her wordings haha esp the 1st sentence,btohqsg
i rather have students who actually try than students who are complacent/self-aggrandising/arrogant,btohqsg
maybe if you actually try or are a fast learner. other than that? nah,btohqsg
Wait i need so much context on this,btohqsg
In yi combi sci students can take 2 pure sci if their combi sci is A2 or A1,btohqsg
is rae just being elitist and saying that Yi is a shit sch,btohqsg
So I think florals just didnâ€™t make the cut,btohqsg
i see. wonder what that person got for combined science if they got rejected?,btohqsg
If thatâ€™s the person O is referring to,btohqsg
whats the facts apart from shit distinction rate,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s more lax than ej btw,btohqsg
I feel like there should be selection test or bridging instead of just straight up rejecting ppl,btohqsg
My friends said it's kinda useless but like ...,btohqsg
i heard it teaches fast as crap  so all the best to that person,btohqsg
I went into yi at first and thats not what they told me,btohqsg
everything is just he said she said,btohqsg
i heard that some ip ppl who screwed promos quite bad have to go for some extra lessons in january to catch up if they want h2 maths,btohqsg
i heard this i heard that,btohqsg
i mean... why would they lie about it?,btohqsg
ur opinion is ur opinion lor,btohqsg
Which is good cause can build on foundations,btohqsg
why got some pseudo-discussion abt projection,btohqsg
Some of them think theyâ€™re naturally smart just cos they scored well for psle without studying and think that they can also do this for As,btohqsg
the telegram group can be the screen,btohqsg
Iirc I did check the website,btohqsg
its a plague in Singapore ngl,btohqsg
idt anyone is like 0% capable of not projecting in Singapore,btohqsg
by your logic  if someone is a target of bullying and they post on reddit about it... that person is lying about it?,btohqsg
thats why i do something called,btohqsg
The logic is not logic ing,btohqsg
we should have like a summariser in this chat grp,btohqsg
you see the way he type,btohqsg
his summary gonna be longer than the actual story,btohqsg
We were making nicknames about schs in Singapore,btohqsg
No wonder Ur GP cock bro,btohqsg
summarise in less then 80 words,btohqsg
Ngl idk why they dont teach aq first,btohqsg
Uk the one where they are like,btohqsg
when she made the joke on sajc,btohqsg
re: reddit as a source. people online always the loudest. you see those bitching about o/a level paper difficulty on reddit where 90% of them talk about failing but doesn't mean come out all fail right,btohqsg
can you stop crediting me whenever u say smth ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Only ppl who did badly will kaopeh,btohqsg
some of them end up all A1 lol,btohqsg
If it went ok they wont even say anything,btohqsg
Sometimes the ppl who think they screw up the most end up all A,btohqsg
Then those overconfident end up having shit results,btohqsg
those who do well for their exams wouldn't feel the need to talk about it on reddit,btohqsg
I don't even rmb what I learnt in GP the order bruh,btohqsg
if i screw up smth that badly  i wont even post it online,btohqsg
I rmb memeing abt the o lvl papers on Reddit but it's more like,btohqsg
Claim: Some schs deserve to be shat onReason: These schs deserve to be shat on because their students complain abt itEvidence 1: I heard from 2 people on discordEvidence 2: I heard from people on redditGeneralisation 1: Because many people are saying it therefore it must be trueLink: Therefore schs deserve to be shat on,btohqsg
No but legit some of them always underestimate themselves or if not they rly just wanna troll lol,btohqsg
its so funny ngl cuz its so satirically stupid,btohqsg
proving that peel is the dumbest thing to eber exist,btohqsg
thr is nth to learn in GP,btohqsg
Bro U making me wanna pon GP so hard now,btohqsg
no it was some guy trolling in the megathread,btohqsg
Then what it's a tangent wave ah,btohqsg
I'm kidding idk what I saying,btohqsg
U just need to1. Answer the fucking question  not answer the question you think the examiner wants you to answer2. Actually care about things3. Actually have OPINIONS and PERSPECTIVES not like wtv the sch word vomits down your mouth4. Be COHERENT in your writing = Practice alot,btohqsg
so happy some schs stop teaching peel in JC,btohqsg
tdy the fmath girl was complaining the way teachers teach in govt schs limits creativity,btohqsg
cos you can't just follow peel,btohqsg
the teachers just teach the students the same things to vomit out during exam so they can get performance bonus,btohqsg
Guys is Econs chp 1&2 important,btohqsg
I thought the GP dept in ac is actually good,btohqsg
yes  apart from that the rest are shit,btohqsg
The notes are and also the chers have good practices,btohqsg
I mean like in terms of things to memorise,btohqsg
What are in AC's GP notes ngl,btohqsg
Like in AC  all GP teachers have to write an essay once a year,btohqsg
Not that impt impt but just understand shld be fine,btohqsg
after my sec sch's 100% pass/63% dist for pure physics i think the teacher is rolling in money,btohqsg
PW is okay also ig  I mean it's ungraded now so just make sure your students pass ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
More impt in j2 I feel,btohqsg
I can send you  I scanned the booklet for my friend,btohqsg
And the teachers have to mark each other,btohqsg
Imma be real alot of things in Econs I feel low-key link to ddss,btohqsg
funni ah  she shit on other schs but nvr shit on hers? u want shit on schs  shit on all,btohqsg
It's thr basic of the basic,btohqsg
question types  QDKC  broadening perspectives  SPERMS etc,btohqsg
Is some goofy ah decision making framework,btohqsg
here's the thing  i realise people that project get triggered a lot when they get called out for it,btohqsg
Decision making I only rly see tested for essay MAYBE,btohqsg
BRO MY TEACHER SAYS THIS IS THE MOST IMPT WHEN PLANNING OUT AN ESSAY,btohqsg
My old GP teacher who left (to go back to journalism) once said that even rj students would see the Acjc GP booklet and be like walao why our sch doesnâ€™t even have such a thing,btohqsg
just rmb the key points bullshit and smoke Ur way out,btohqsg
Wait how can they even test that chapter for essay or Issit like they just need some definitions fromChp 2,btohqsg
i mean with your handwriting  it doesn't matter whether you whack or not,btohqsg
Ask U the decision making process of idk whatever,btohqsg
They can test RDM  see 2021 paper,btohqsg
my teacher read my question planning and he says my points are broad and coherent,btohqsg
but he says I need to give a better counter argument,btohqsg
IF THE QUESTION HAS 10 WORDS,btohqsg
MAKE SURE U TARGET ALL 10 WORDS,btohqsg
Like I can't rly rmb now la but,btohqsg
Bruh you not even taking As anymore,btohqsg
n word n word n word n word n word,btohqsg
imo  cuz i shit on ite on a daily basis:),btohqsg
Shit based on own experience one thing,btohqsg
I mean as long as they keep for their personal use sure  but I donâ€™t get why she wants,btohqsg
If they leak online I may get into trouble if caught tho,btohqsg
Also another year would be 2018 the question on the cross island line,btohqsg
That one stumped a lot of ppl,btohqsg
yep  u shit based on what other ppl say is another thing.,btohqsg
I love maths and I want to stretch myself. I want to expand my maths knowledge and play with numbers so I can make more Math songs and poems. And most of all  I want to use these numbers to make movies and music or just for the fun of it and to inspire other girls to love Maths. The gender gap in STEM is disproportionately skewed towards guys so I want to shine that light and open the door for girls and women everywhere,btohqsg
So they tested solely chp 2?,btohqsg
Sry for my blunder again that day btw,btohqsg
tbf she does shit on her own sch,btohqsg
Nah some of the essay qns can test a range of chapters. For RDM concepts from other chapters may be involved,btohqsg
but not as much as the rest,btohqsg
The RDM framework is inside the syllabus doc,btohqsg
it could be blind leading the blind,btohqsg
I thought itâ€™s sth good so that theyâ€™re forced to rmbr what a proper essay is like,btohqsg
Personally I think it would be better if they did it with other schs,btohqsg
I can pm you my tuition centreâ€™s TYS answers for some particular qns if you want  but your sch should also release theirs closer to As,btohqsg
rather than self mark their own work within their own sch,btohqsg
cuz ur just rehasing what ur teaching,btohqsg
it can be a limit for improvement tbf,btohqsg
Also the rae person went inactive,btohqsg
Its why i like reading what other students write,btohqsg
Actually moe should make it compulsory then,btohqsg
cuz ik how other schs teach their essay structure and ik what they kinda look for,btohqsg
it doesnt rly actively improve the quality of teaching,btohqsg
and some schs already do that,btohqsg
so theres no point for moe to step in,btohqsg
"within geog at least theres a few ""alliances""",btohqsg
then theyll share notes  resources etc.,btohqsg
so these schs tend to perform similarly,btohqsg
At least I think through this exercise it would be an opportunity for chers from different schs to exchange feedback and share good practices,btohqsg
i cant say which ones here,btohqsg
ya its q normal practice alr,btohqsg
Ik for a fact geog have,btohqsg
GP wise I think also have,btohqsg
Yall i feel like a expensive cpu that has high maintenance and a shit cooling system rn,btohqsg
He can't say here I think,btohqsg
this the only one I can say,btohqsg
all schs literally teach the same content and use almost similar notes,btohqsg
I was half expecting ac to be inside,btohqsg
Cause im literally overheating rn in a aircon gym,btohqsg
unfortunately it was like half her personality,btohqsg
Ngl i feel like beating my classmate up,btohqsg
and im trying to cool down rn by being under a fan,btohqsg
but Benjamin Goh is batchmates with the NJC ex Geog Deputy head and the Ex EJC geog deputy head,btohqsg
susan meow is just waiting to retire so idt she cba,btohqsg
I wish the one who got cross deployed to a Pri sch didnâ€™t leave,btohqsg
Might actually faint its damn hot for me,btohqsg
She very aunty like but sheâ€™s quite decent,btohqsg
If i ever get time ill backread,btohqsg
apparantly acc to my sources shes the saving grace of ac geog,btohqsg
Wait this is actually damn bad im overheating as soon as im away from fan,btohqsg
So i need go READ UP,btohqsg
so i can tell my students abt it,btohqsg
Ngl my gp teacher is very English teacher core,btohqsg
The way she talks is so slay,btohqsg
Im gnna go on learning journey to nus tmr,btohqsg
she told me she got found out on the disc for shittng on ppl,btohqsg
Ngl idl gp but idm listening to her yap,btohqsg
like if disc i wont know lah,btohqsg
Yall if i dont return in 5mins i probably fainted and ambulance is on the way,btohqsg
ima go finish my deadlift set,btohqsg
But some bozo sent her and she put it in the discord,btohqsg
I feel like rae is very elitist,btohqsg
Even the thing they say is the SAME,btohqsg
Its literally the same food in different bento boxes,btohqsg
Florals want take what her choice what,btohqsg
FUCK KURO that's not how you'd phrase it,btohqsg
Don't shoot yourself in the foot,btohqsg
but the staff at gym told me to go home,btohqsg
Kuro can you proofread before you send,btohqsg
I started gym not long ago bro,btohqsg
don't phrase it like that that,btohqsg
that is linked to the disc,btohqsg
tell them to cut the crap and fuck off if they wanna be like that,btohqsg
so ppl will eventually find out,btohqsg
i cant believe i need teahc geog soon,btohqsg
ill send u my live location if i stay in same spot more than 15 mins and i dont respond to texts help me call ambulance,btohqsg
i pack up at gym first,btohqsg
H1 oni should be no biggie for u right LOL,btohqsg
Stay safe rea dont be like me,btohqsg
actually ik the h1 geog j2s in ej,btohqsg
(yes im only teaching ej students),btohqsg
I drop out of Mi to go ejc,btohqsg
Poor material and non material SOL,btohqsg
then idn spend time recreating notes,btohqsg
Btw rae also shits on MI,btohqsg
just send them my GP worksheets,btohqsg
Nah i have shitty health. Stay safe and dont be like me,btohqsg
i just went her form teachers house like,btohqsg
many ppl shit on diff schs rite it's like  how ppl diff on diff car brands,btohqsg
Its time to drop ur friend a text,btohqsg
Cuz her form teacher is a gp cher,btohqsg
I don't give them that attention,btohqsg
If her subject combi still means shes in THAT class,btohqsg
btw rae shits on sch or ppl,btohqsg
cuz she doing pcmh and pcmh is normally in one specific class,btohqsg
Huuuh she never shit on me tho,btohqsg
rae mainly shits from JC students,btohqsg
calm down it's not abt u,btohqsg
or isit cause ik what she looks like,btohqsg
Valerie ill drop u the location ah,btohqsg
aren't they normally spamming this chat with their brainrot material shit,btohqsg
Rea u coincidentally have the same display name as the whatsapp name i have of you,btohqsg
Btw isnt it cause its my name,btohqsg
Heya  new to this place  where can I ask people to rate my nus application chance lol?,btohqsg
i wonder y she nvr start shittalking on ite,btohqsg
Maybe make a post on r/sgexams reddit,btohqsg
i actually kinda agree with that retarded poly part tho,btohqsg
i rather she shittalk on ite rather then jc poly mi,btohqsg
Also if you are intl student  i think the benchmarks for local and intl student is diff. So maybe can ask admissions counsellor for more specific advices. Good luck,btohqsg
ya thts cuz u r inside  she isnt,btohqsg
but I heard CDE is the dumping ground of NUSâ€¦ right?â€¦ (I hope so),btohqsg
Unpopular opinion but engineering degree is not that useful,btohqsg
ever since i recommended that book you've been just obsessed with it,btohqsg
i dont know what shit you are talking about,btohqsg
Nvm I guess we donâ€™t cancel here? I hope. As long as we are not Josh we should be able to agree to disagree,btohqsg
How did they score with one less player?,btohqsg
Once she leaves idk if her replacement will be as good,btohqsg
Wait which user is josh again,btohqsg
As in we donâ€™t do stuff like deliberately not talk to her if she sends a msg just let it be business as usual,btohqsg
I met josh irl if i remembered correctly so,btohqsg
i swear is it called bunbun,btohqsg
Tbh I also still donâ€™t think in the sg context all schs are good schs. That all schs are good schs tagline is just some euphemism. I still think yi is in a terrible state  and it would continue to be unless sth drastic happens. Like leadership change  more funding  else it would just continue being the jc which accepts students with the worst results. And itâ€™s possible for a low tier JC to improve  just look at srjc  and ny improved from being a mid tier Jc in the 2000s to a top one.,btohqsg
All schs are good schs on paper only so,btohqsg
As long as he doesnâ€™t surprise come here during April fools I guess weâ€™re good,btohqsg
thing is criticism is fine  but not what wtv that was,btohqsg
I can try to find that msg where matcha summarised the shit that happened,btohqsg
Wait is the disc and tele run by diff ppl,btohqsg
Seems like 2 different factions  those who get pissed off here go to discord to rant,btohqsg
Ngl i only found out the existence of sgexams from dekita ðŸ’€,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t expect that there would be so much drama in the SGE comm when I rejoined this chat lol,btohqsg
But I guess with how boring my NS life is got to preoccupy myself with sth,btohqsg
I joined then left then joined then left then joined again,btohqsg
i mean is ran by the same ppl,btohqsg
wait so dekita is js owner and doesn't do anything and everything is done by adminsÂ¿,btohqsg
But the ppl inside arenâ€™t rly the same,btohqsg
No comments idk what's going on,btohqsg
If its abt their topic then,btohqsg
ig 5k is decent enough for fresh grad,btohqsg
high by ite and maybe poly standards,btohqsg
but by uni standards its decent ig,btohqsg
but finance bros make crazy amts in intern if they super good,btohqsg
It also rly depends on the course and uni,btohqsg
Some courses can have 5-6k as normal starting pay,btohqsg
I think nus BBA starting pay is quite high  unlike ntu bba,btohqsg
Then again those are self reported isnt it,btohqsg
But after rereading again I also donâ€™t get why Josh wasnâ€™t punished by the admin on discord for saying that expletive,btohqsg
As in the juicecogens can suck thing,btohqsg
Huh I thought heâ€™s still sending messages on discord,btohqsg
Jobs are honestly dependent on what u want and if u are willing to accept the pay,btohqsg
If u cant accept the pay then gg lor,btohqsg
If all is good we should welcome him with open arms,btohqsg
Not good to harbour resentments for long,btohqsg
Bro my entire social life isnt on discord yk,btohqsg
Not rlly one to say since my friend grp is rlly fked up,btohqsg
Maybe more fucked up than the social issues in sgexams,btohqsg
I just keep my social circle small,btohqsg
Better to have a few very good close friends than many fake ppl,btohqsg
My friend grp got like 10-20 ppl max,btohqsg
Mines not even that much lol,btohqsg
finance and cs tend to be the outliers on the high side. then humanities/social sciences are the low end. engineering is usually the common median to look at,btohqsg
Its cause childhood friends rope in other yk,btohqsg
Ye humanities important but low pay so rip,btohqsg
Like we have a main grp,btohqsg
Since we all know each other from pri sch or longer,btohqsg
we rope in other friends for hanging out,btohqsg
If not what does yk stand for,btohqsg
Now the main friend grp got a lot of kinda ppl,btohqsg
Iâ€™m not a singaporean  but I donâ€™t think singapore needs a lot of engineers (except for civil or construction stuff),btohqsg
name one type of person and we might have it,btohqsg
Tekki got some issue with me,btohqsg
but he don't even know why bruh,btohqsg
He insulted me bef and startes a whole ass argument in diff server,btohqsg
then when i met him again in sgexam i ask why he say he dk,btohqsg
the benchmark usually looks at electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. those are the most dominant ones,btohqsg
if you say you hate metal  he will say you do not know anything about music at all and you're just giving stupid takes,btohqsg
WAIT YALL I JS REMEMBER MY BEEF WITH TEKKI,btohqsg
U reminded me what my beef with him is,btohqsg
Long story short i told a disc server im new to  to excuse some of the stuff i say and i might be too direct because i have this personality disorder,btohqsg
then someone i got flamed by the whole server,btohqsg
dekita may pop in and out to see what's happening  but she did ban ppl before,btohqsg
I thought u said its bc of the volunteering thing??,btohqsg
That's when i was in dms with someone else,btohqsg
I have no idea what's happening with tekki rn,btohqsg
I just leave my ypt on when I slep,btohqsg
turn on ypt and never turn it off,btohqsg
cause my timetable rabs so i have some 2h free periods,btohqsg
but my friend in ocs ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
then my friends in those class with all same combi no free periods at all,btohqsg
I think u can go check the chats ah but its so long ago,btohqsg
why is chem going SO FAST,btohqsg
apparently we're starting chap 5 on thurs!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1!1,btohqsg
O ya i forgot do disclaimer here,btohqsg

if i say smt that is at the wrong timing or smt inappropriate js let me know ah,btohqsg
i suck with social cues and shit,btohqsg
my h2 chem classmates say they cover 1 topic in 1 lecture,btohqsg
yeah that's my sch as well,btohqsg
No like i cant tell social cues and like when to shut up yk,btohqsg
My h2 chem lecturers are so boring,btohqsg
apparently i had to watch the gas equilibrium lecture today,btohqsg
Ngl h2 hist lectures are the only ones i enjoy,btohqsg
so like legit tell me to shut up if needed,btohqsg
but I was doing volunteering stuff,btohqsg
nah i would rather p to shut up,btohqsg
I dont even watch h2 math lecturesH2 bio boringH2 chem make me want to ðŸ˜´H1 gp is time to talk to ppl on telegram,btohqsg
i basically got this personality disorder that fucks up my perception of boundaries and social norms,btohqsg
H2 maths = sleepH2 bio = sleepH2 chem = sleepGP = sleepPW = sleepH1 hist = super saiyan mode,btohqsg
reagan do u have the photo u took of me during the carnival,btohqsg

hello guys i went through abit of development,btohqsg
or u alr forgot abt it,btohqsg
can we openly say that metal is not the only genre of music,btohqsg
Something related to my personality disorder thing,btohqsg
if he doesn't rmb  i'm assuming it's over...,btohqsg
i got banned from the server so good luck finding out where LOL,btohqsg
oh now i remember everyone was dogging on u in that server,btohqsg
but it wasnt cos of personality disorder,btohqsg
rea was banned from a server im in because the members were all pissed at him,btohqsg
Dude got a few servers u only joined one,btohqsg
@tekkichickenbreastdo you still talk to joey,btohqsg
She js pretends to not know me here,btohqsg
were we not in the server created after sher's server was deleted,btohqsg
rea wasnt in elysia i think,btohqsg
Like join the argument in one,btohqsg
bro this mf has the greatest personality change and I don't even know what i did,btohqsg
elysia at the time was fn yapping about her boyfriend,btohqsg

"*mentions her bf once and apologizes to her*joey: ""oh no it's okay man I'm fine with it HAHA""1 day laterjoey: STFU STOP TALKING ABOUT MY BOYFRIEND!!! BAN BAN BANme: ????!",btohqsg
