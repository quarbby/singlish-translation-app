keep the phone with banking app at home. another phone to bring out.,btohqsg
I think its better for urself to be vigilant with your main phone.,btohqsg
So no Chinese brand is the key lol,btohqsg
you buy iPhone no use one. if you meet bad people they put a knife at your throat ask you to unlock your phone  how secure also no use.,btohqsg
Lock your fd and bank balance if have 10 k and above in your apps,btohqsg
If you only do at home  can just use computer no?,btohqsg
Avoid cheap Chinese phone  go with bigger brand = Google or Samsung as security update are still push out or at least they have slightly longer support timeline,btohqsg
then they drain all your banks. if you set bank apps to need to wait 24hr before can change payee/transfer limits  your kidnapper will just keep you alive for another 24hr before they drain your accounts and throw you into the sea,btohqsg
No a lot of the banks need a app on your phone as token,btohqsg
maybe put into CPF better. this way they can't get the money out.,btohqsg
So far I use ocbc apps to lock my $$. That's the main purpose to keep safe...,btohqsg
I think bodies worth money one so won't anyhow throw,btohqsg
Is Amex highflyer good to get?,btohqsg
That's why a few scams have target cpf account on the older people,btohqsg
true. maybe the organs after draining all the bank accounts.,btohqsg
now no more +1% for incremental?,btohqsg
Hey max doesnt even show the card for the merchant,btohqsg
that is separate everyday rewards promo,btohqsg
oh then not too bad  still can get more than 4%,btohqsg
only 1 month cause is compared to previous month,btohqsg
Got. That part same same. Up to max 300 dollars,btohqsg
Think if u can plan it perfectly is second month put more then 300k then first month then u get still 1% on 300 dollars on hsbc ega,btohqsg
Hi all  i have been linking citi rewards mastercard to amaze. with the latest changes  will there be the 1% wallet top fee for local spend? or is the 1% just for foreign spend?,btohqsg
Everyday+ Rewards Programme (1% interest) is credited in EGA a/c around 6th of each month (if you are eligible). Interest calculation is based on incremental Average Daily Balance (ADB) of each month versus the ADB of its Previous Month.,btohqsg
Hi Guys and ladies.Latest update.Now kris pay give more time for members to transfer miles to kris miles in Sq account.  Extend from 7 days to 21 days,btohqsg
U linking the crmc so 1% for local trnx above 1k  and no fee for overseas trnx. The fee only for topping amaze wallet with master card.,btohqsg
As it is capped at 300 dollars. Maybe the best ideal is first month put 300k  then second month put 600k.Then withdraw after second month to another account. Come back after 2 months period,btohqsg
like that might well 1st month with person A full 900K if u have  then 2nd month with person B full 900K,btohqsg
No u need to control 2 separate Hsbc EGA account to get the max 4.x% pa interest every month.,btohqsg
Actually not advisable to put so much $$. MAS say insured up to 100k . Latest update,btohqsg
It might not work because sometimes the 1 bouns interest reward is based on not the previous month average balance. 2 the bonus interest programme will say if you joined may+jun programme u cant join the Jun+july one then you another account usually need completely clean out by 2 months instead.,btohqsg
u know EGA and everyday rewards is 2 separate promo right ? To maximize the everyday rewards  u need 2 person. For example June  person A put all  then July person B put all  so both can get max 4+ interest for 1 month,btohqsg
Yes I know I am operating it for 2 person already for a while. I agree if u max out the 1% but not the bouns interest amount which is way biggerThis is why I said I didn't like ega on their major interest only come in a few months back and u won't know if it works later on. Sometimes the bouns interest only compared to 2 months previous daily average balance  and rules keep changing like put into tiers,btohqsg
Hi  just realised that if i wan to buy 10qty of the same vouchers in wogi  i have to buy 1 by 1. Is there a way to buy more without having to do it 10 times? üòÖüòÇ,btohqsg
Anyone sms HSBC EGA already? Are they replying correctly with June participation acknowledgement?,btohqsg
When does uob pay the bonus interest for uob one account usually?,btohqsg
6th working day of next month,btohqsg
Don't think so. Never saw so soon. But maybe the 5th day have,btohqsg
U are a hsbc ega lover,btohqsg
Oh no  I was once with RHB  SCB and etc  but their promo rates* didn't last,btohqsg
It applies to any bank account including fixed deposit. So the way u can avoid is having as much banks as possible or just spend all your money don't keep in banks,btohqsg
I always got it on the second working day  ocbc is 7th,btohqsg
Ah okie u very lucky I hope to see it earlier,btohqsg
Interest credit is automatic one ba  I don‚Äôt see why you will receive it later,btohqsg
How did u rotate ur fund in ur hsbc ega to max out the interest?,btohqsg
U mean Alternate keep two months HSBC and move some funds to another account SC/UOB ?,btohqsg
Beside hsbc ega  ocbc 360  e-saver and uob one  what is the next best saving account to max out interest?,btohqsg
OK I checked ur are right i got last on 3rd May indeed,btohqsg
Should keep only one month. Alternate every month,btohqsg
Now the difference pretty small on top I use stashaway for fixed deposit,btohqsg
Ah alternate make sense yea. Means may in hsbc  Jun in scb  July hsbc? Because when in May programme it covers May and jun,btohqsg
Isn't the campaign for April&May   Now June July ?,btohqsg
Yeah I thought two months too where in the second month u put more than previous month,btohqsg
Ok thanks let me check out stashaway. I cannot use both hsbc ega and esaver for july as im kept out from the promotion due to the increamental of previous month,btohqsg
Its may  june. Then june  july. Only can sign 1,btohqsg
Hi everyone just to check for EGA June promo if you put incremental 10K in June and then keep the same in July - will you get the additional 3.4% only for June (I understand Everyday+ will definitely just give 1% pa for June only).,btohqsg
so if I have 0 in May  10K in June  10K in 3 July (all totals) - I ll receive 4.45% is June on the 10K (assume I qualify for Everyday+ too) and 3.45 % for July(just no Everyday+ bonus) on the 10K too?,btohqsg
If you don't mind 1% less for the 2nd month then sure,btohqsg
oh  that is nice - thank you @TW,btohqsg
Hmm Melvyn based on the T&Cs isn't it 4.45% and 3.45% respectively?,btohqsg
Based on t&c  10k is 3.30% bonus interest.,btohqsg
This link that Chris shared earlier says 3.45%  no?https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/everyday-global/terms-and-conditions-lny-ega-promotion.pdf,btohqsg
Oh wait you're referring to Jun's promo. For@MarwenBenMessaoudit's 3.30% bonus interest because he registered in May.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn ‚ô° coffee on me if u wanna meet,btohqsg
Oh really may lower. Gosh. I have rolled into the April programme  kept 2 months. Shifting to another human hsbc ega for June and July programmeTrying to recall why didn't shift it in may because 1 the may programme was based on incremental over March adb (I could be wrong),btohqsg
Yup no tiered promo in Jun.Can compare with May's promo here:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/194170,btohqsg
Melvyn can open coffee shop already. So many fans,btohqsg
Just something that occured to me - for those who didn't register May HSBC EGA  it is a good opportunity to empty your UOB accounts (leave 1K I suppose) into EGA  sign up for June to get 4.45% on that amount. And then shift back to UOB in July if and when the new UOB promo comes out,btohqsg
Interesting. I still got my earmarks locked in uob though so happy to stay there but let me check maybe it's gonna release 2h jun,btohqsg
Guys and ladies. If you are travelling do buy travel insurance,btohqsg
@AdrainHoado not post irrelevant news  or at least summarise it if you feel the need to share,btohqsg
A summary for jun high interest saving account:Uob 4% on 150k (need salary+spend)Ocbc 4.6% on 100k (need salary+grow+spend)Hsbc ega 3.45% (plus 1% max 300dollars)Scb esaver 3.55% (fuss free)Trust+ 3% to 3.5% on 500kMaribank 2.88% on 100kFeel free to correct and add thanks,btohqsg
Scb online banking setup is the worst ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
"Just signed up for UOB Priv Miles card  but not able to SMS register ""PMAF"". Anyone faced this issue as well? Or issit need fulfill the spending criteria + pay annual fee first?",btohqsg
nah is for June-July 2 month cycle for SCB eSaver,btohqsg
3.55 percent for two months only?,btohqsg
Yes. The banks will announce new rates after July. Been always like that,btohqsg
yes then u merry go round with another high saving bank account,btohqsg
Does ega need those spending  giro etc etc or just need fresh funds?,btohqsg
Sure u can withdraw anytime anyway,btohqsg
If 50k deposit balance today in esaver  need to increase deposit next month to get 3.55?,btohqsg
I mean like to fulfil the high interest criteria,btohqsg
It's up to u to leave for higher return yes,btohqsg
My understanding is u didn't had any deposit with them earlier then ur 50k is fresh for 3.55% these 2 months.,btohqsg
Dont understand what you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm asking when can we withdraw but still fulfil the criteria for high interest,btohqsg
CIMB for existing user 3.5% also for Fastsaver,btohqsg
Second month still have 3.55? As the fund is not fresh anymore from first month?,btohqsg
I thought important to share need to have travel insurance.. also some able to get miles reward,btohqsg
You didn't share about travel insurance. You just copy and pasted a wall of text from the news.,btohqsg
Okk...next time I don't share about SQ accident news,btohqsg
Meaning for ur HSBC EGA's interest in July  u will give up and just move all fund back to UOB in July?,btohqsg
Upto the point where UOB interest can be greater than 3.45%,btohqsg
Earn a flat interest rate of 3.50%** p.a. by simply topping up a minimum of S$5 000 incremental fresh funds# (compared to month-end balance of 31 May 2024) into your account from 1 June to 31 July 2024.,btohqsg
Hi HY  is this flat 3.5% promo for CIMB Starsavers account too vs 31/5/2024 end balance?,btohqsg
3.5 I think is very good...,btohqsg
Can I use UOB KF+Amaze to convert contactless payment (for Nam Ho Travel) and still earn 3MPD?,btohqsg
Does SC works with daily average for Esaver ?,btohqsg
if their MCC falls in UOBKF's whitelist yes,btohqsg
Min balance 5k maintain. And open by 31 July,btohqsg
quick question - for HSBC Everyday+ Rewards  it used to be every other month move in 2k + 5 txn  has it now changed to every month need to move in 2k + 5 txn?,btohqsg
Looks like namho is not in the list lei‚Ä¶ do dun think so,btohqsg
Bros.. I make a mistake.I forgot to switch to citi rewards card amaze.. now my gym member fee they charge to ocbc rewards card.. like that means 0 miles earn ?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if buy grabgift from shopback can choose different denomination?  Eg $100  can choose 5x$20 when redeeming?,btohqsg
I remove ocbc rewards from amaze already,btohqsg
Thinking to sign up HSBC Revolution Card and need to spend $500.. But Grocery and FastFood MCC is excluded..Is there any voucher i can buy to meet eligible transaction just to meet the $500 spending?,btohqsg
Same... been using for the whole of May but got nth,btohqsg
vouchers from heymax should code as 5311  in the whitelist,btohqsg
Guys citi reward exclude mobile wallet meaning thing such as google wallet paywave?,btohqsg
If i decide to use amaze on google wallet paywave should be no issue right?,btohqsg
Where do you see? Login to get website?,btohqsg
Yes. Always link amaze to citi rewards.,btohqsg
This card has become quite useless after nerfs. Can only use for dining but have to check MCC before using,btohqsg
Agree with you.. basically they are just dinning .. online shopping.. but be careful.,btohqsg
Online shopping on Lazada and Shopee should be quite safe right?,btohqsg
Online shopping basically is better only 3 choices.1. Dbs woman's world card.2. Citi rewards card.3. Ocbc rewards card,btohqsg
I think check it's term and conditions..  as I usually use hsbc for restaurants eat only.,btohqsg
Citi rewards with amaze is better than citi cashback with amaze? I mostly just want to use the card for cashbacklooks like a 2.27% cashback rate if i use citi rewards instead of citi cashback is that right? is there anything else the rewards card is used for other than the higher cashback?,btohqsg
Retail spend  dining  online store still counted. Wouldn‚Äôt deem it as useless,btohqsg
For those withdrawing uob1 to $1001 today  do you guys still self transfer salary this month?,btohqsg
Citi rewards 1k max is it by calendar mth or bill date ?,btohqsg
Wait my bad  is statement mnth,btohqsg
Sorry just went to check the T&Cs again,btohqsg
Usually for such cases  I requested to change my statement month to follow the calendar month. So no such issues tracking which cards are based on calendar or statement month,btohqsg
Ahh idea.. then can follow amaze also,btohqsg
Can I still get scb cc sign up gift from singsaver even though I have scb account? Nv sign up scb cc before,btohqsg
Yes if the tnc states that the promotion is for new card holders,btohqsg
not possible for citi. depending on the cso you'll get different statement dates offered  but I don't think anyone's gotten it to align with the end of month unlike say UOB.,btohqsg
Never had that issue when requesting or I could at least get it as close to the start day and end day of the month,btohqsg
5th is probably the closest you can get for citi,btohqsg
Nope I got some with 2nd or 3rd,btohqsg
some? your citi cards have different statement dates for each?,btohqsg
Just applied for Esaver with SC  how long it takes to approve ? I thought it is instantaneous,btohqsg
Hello   whats the best debit cards for students? Im currently using the dbs debit card,btohqsg
I have an old EZ-Link card and an HSBC Revolution credit card  and I wanted to use both. I have now successfully registered my old EZ-Link card on the SimplyGo app. With this online registration  it seems I can continue using my old physical EZ-Link card.However  I'm wondering about the benefits of SimplyGo. I can already top up my EZ-Link card and check my transaction history through the EZ-Link app.What I was expecting from SimplyGo was the ability to add a contactless transport payment option to my Apple Wallet  allowing me to use either my HSBC or EZ-Link contactless card for transport payments.So  I would like to know if there is a way to add my EZ-Link card to my Apple Wallet.,btohqsg
Not everyone see the value in HSBC.,btohqsg
not possible to add the ez-link cards to wallet apps. if you want to use ez-link you'll still need the physical card.,btohqsg
Is there a contactless credit card that is solely for transportation and includes the SimplyGo program?,btohqsg
SCB Smart or Lady‚Äôs card transport category,btohqsg
I am a handsome  simple man next door.üòã,btohqsg
the UOB lady's card is unisex though,btohqsg
Anyone encountered this error when applying for standard chartered cards?,btohqsg
How do you guys pay town council fee? My TC only receive mc/visa,btohqsg
Are we getting CDC vouchers this month?,btohqsg
Guys isit worth it to pay annual fees to get miles under UOB Privi Miles sign up promotion?,btohqsg
If u got large ticket spending soon,btohqsg
Haha can definitely spend the $1000 in 2 months,btohqsg
Worth. Total spend around 2 261 (9044 miles if u use 4mpd card instead) and you get 45k miles in exchange. Visa version is a good card for cardup too.,btohqsg
"Just signed up for UOB Priv Miles card  but not able to SMS register ""PMAF"". Anyone faced this issue as well? Or issit need fulfill the spending criteria + pay annual fee first?",btohqsg
I did this right right after my card approved. By default they waive 1st year fee.,btohqsg
And I can get 6MPD using UOB PPV if I book flights via Expedia right‚Ä¶,btohqsg
There is a catch. UOB version of Expedia may be more expensive (from same price to 5-7% from my experience). Double check the price every time u book.,btohqsg
How did u know not able to?,btohqsg
But I suppose it‚Äôs still one of the better ways to earn miles on flights? Or any other credit card?,btohqsg
Strange. Try writing in to uob,btohqsg
I have send email tocards.center@uobgroup.com  awaiting for their reply,btohqsg
If you plan to use it to pay your insurance and income tax  can use CardUp platform as well,btohqsg
Yes I went to UOB TMR to activate it,btohqsg
Lets see what uob says ba,btohqsg
This is good choice.  Good for hospital bills private.. mostly can't already for other bank. I heard only scb can,btohqsg
U earn miles but u paying more for it. U shud see whats your valuation of miles and determine from there,btohqsg
See if the 5% increase in price justify extra 2mpd,btohqsg
So perhaps a normal HSBC revolution book directly w SQ might make more sense,btohqsg
Haha I try to apply  but aft Singpass I get 404 error. Shld I apply directly via UOB or MoneySmart?,btohqsg
Can I use UOB absolute Cashback credit card to pay insurance and medical bills? Is there any exclusion?,btohqsg
I'm plan to do this also.EGA new open approve on 28th May  I send register on 29th May  I no need to register again on June for the 4.45%  right? I only start fund in on 1st June .,btohqsg
Btw any mile chasers enticed by dbs yuu 18% enough to switch to cashback?,btohqsg
Does this mean 6mpd is back?,btohqsg
It was enticing at the start but now I realised how difficult it is to find giant near me üòÇ so don't use anymore,btohqsg
Should I upgrade solitaire to metal card?,btohqsg
https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/rewards/ladys-card/index.pageIf u pair w ladys savings and has min depo,btohqsg
Not inc in mpd unless u like the design tbh,btohqsg
No it‚Äôs in pairing with lady‚Äôs savings acc for certain deposit amount,btohqsg
I actually like the new hsbc app  shows the points break down  but then still wish they would show the bonus points breakdown too,btohqsg
U guys like to make baseless assumptions. What do u guys gain from it? Like i said i am just sharing what happened for people to avoid similar pitfalls and i dont gain anything from it.,btohqsg
I pay my credit cards bills in full every month on time and i NEVER advance cash from credit cards,btohqsg
Chill bro. Just making guesses on the possible reason why you are targeted. Will stop since you take offence over it. Peace!,btohqsg
In 2000 i was the first teacher below age of 25 to declare 1mill income and pay income tax and it came out in the papers. U dont know me so dont talk shit,btohqsg
"All these rotations ""profits"" are small money but i just like the fun of maximizing this kind of thing. Its like a game to me",btohqsg
Hi all which credit card should i use for petrol? Miles or cashback?Was looking at miles cc only applicable one i can find is uob ladys card under travel with kris+,btohqsg
Then it shld be OK for you. Just chill and move on.,btohqsg
Open tuition ctr also not easy. In the end also must find teachers to teach and also pay rental,btohqsg
We were the original batch of Super Tutors and i was the only one still in MOE as a scholar. Had to leave MOE when i got featured in the papers,btohqsg
Not uob ppv  is uob privi,btohqsg
The money doesnt matter. Just buay song how the bank just close it. If they have proof of crime then it wont be closing account it will be frozen account (for those ignorant people who like to shoot their mouth off),btohqsg
It should be under transport not travel,btohqsg
I will say they have the rights to not having business relationship with you. Just like you have the rights to not having business relationship with them as well. Aka boycott. Nothing you else can do.,btohqsg
I get closed by maybank for small amt in and out also,btohqsg
Yup they have the right. So i only appealed. Just feel buay song thats all. And share with the group for the benefit of those who think moving money for rotation is 100% safe. Its not.,btohqsg
My condolences. Banks r for profit organisations. They can take advantage of others but they dont like to be taken advantage of.,btohqsg
No need reason to close  You already say Ëé´È°ªÊúâ,btohqsg
Can we pair Citi CashBack with Amaze and earn cashback on the credit card?,btohqsg
U dont need pair also can earn ah  as long as it eligible mcc,btohqsg
Hi all  which miles card would u recommend to apply after all these below(My monthly spending around 8k sgd)1) uob lady solitaire2) uob visa preferred3) uob visa signature4) hsbc revolution5) citi rewards,btohqsg
How much is the Cashbacks compared to pairing with CIMB WMC for foreign transactions ?,btohqsg
Anyone gotten this from tiger? Can't seem to find what the maximum amount to be kept for the 6.8%.,btohqsg
You will need more than 1 card since the bonus miles is usually cap at 1k and depends what your monthly spending of 8k comprises of,btohqsg
Please read the card tnc for cashback explain,btohqsg
I have maxed out all the cards above alrdy,btohqsg
OP has all the cards listed already,btohqsg
Oh chey I misread. I tot he asking which he should apply,btohqsg
50% dining40% hotel and flight5-10% retail,btohqsg
Which is better team cashback or miles,btohqsg
uob KF might be niceall ur categories fit into uob kf,btohqsg
But i dont always take sq  sometimes emirates and others,btohqsg
u can use uob kf for dining/retail/hotel,btohqsg
For ur dining  r u using kris+?,btohqsg
Provided if the place has this payment method  i will pay using kris+,btohqsg
I am usingHsbc for airline tixAmaze citi & visa sign for overseas spendingThe rest local,btohqsg
Wah you spend 8k.. really a lot,btohqsg
Not every month exactly 8k lah ~ sometimes  6  12 15k ~ i just avg it,btohqsg
12k to 15k also a lot,btohqsg
You spend like that already burst eg dbs world woman card at 1500. Citi rewards at 1100. Like that above the bonus cap. You only get 1 miles per every $$ spend,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why i asking for miles expertise here nah ~ ü•µ,btohqsg
Balance spending i just use citi prestigeü•≤,btohqsg
Do you use your bank points transfer to hotel loyalty programme.  Jun,btohqsg
What is that arh? Cause i always book hotel directly from citi agoda or uob agoda,btohqsg
Actually I also just learn too ...,btohqsg
Ocbc points and hsbc points can be transfer to hotel loyalty programme . Eg marriot bonvy hotels,btohqsg
How to earn the points? I only know about miles lol nth else or should i start using cashback?,btohqsg
For ocbc points and hsbc revolution points can be transfer to marriot bonvy points,btohqsg
You have hsbc revolution points. Actually can be transfer to hotel points beside transfer to Kris flyer account,btohqsg
Usually i dont pay attention to that  i just charge the hotel to business side if necessary! Oops,btohqsg
I also don't really pay attention to that until. Recently marriot bonvy say can status match to SQ elite miles. So th·∫•y can reach kris elite silver or Gold,btohqsg
I go and take a. Look later then! Thanks budd,btohqsg
Moving money for rotation is 100% safe if you don‚Äôt abuse the bank cut off timings. And if u do same name to same name transfers. And not very day do la. Once a month big in/out perfectly fine. If more than $200k sizes over a few days also ok.If bank asks u for info  just provide and tell them the truth u are taking part in bank fresh funds promo. They won‚Äôt care. They just care if your money is clean or not.,btohqsg

Summary:‚Ä¢ For a $1 000 purchase: HSBC Revolution (4 000 miles)‚Ä¢ For a $1 500 purchase: DBS Woman's Card (6 000 miles)‚Ä¢ For a $2 000 purchase: UOB Lady's Solitaire (8 000 miles)‚Ä¢ For a $3 000 purchase: Maybank VI (9 600 miles)‚Ä¢ For a $5 000 purchase: Maybank VI (16 000 miles)ChatGPT,btohqsg

Can look at uob krisflyer or maybank horizon as other suggest,btohqsg
I set up payee to my uob ac for moving my fund.,btohqsg
I have UOB one card  still considered new-to-UOB?,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt do it. If u go and pay $50 x 100 times. Maybank will be your best friend in sending u love letter.,btohqsg

They fool only lah lol  coz i can spend quite alot. Just give it to other bank loh,btohqsg
I did it last time. Got limit 30 transactions a day. After 6 months in a row they stopped me.,btohqsg
Think till now uob havent close my cc is also because i spend alot,btohqsg
And i pay on time every month and no cash advance (in case some people anyhow guess),btohqsg
Banks come up with all this is to entice u to spend more. So most importantly is u must have the ability to spend. But when its the other way round u keep earning their interests and promotional cash they dont earn anything for u  after a while  they will stop u.,btohqsg
They wouldn't allow .. haha. Too troublesome for them also retailers...,btohqsg

For 1st timer for dbs credit card Is it better sign altitude 1st or Vantage 1st ?,btohqsg
Sign dbs attitude card unless you feel is worth it. To spend 3k in 2 months. If is me I won't. I have the choice I go for dbs premier miles. Spend 800 in 2 months to get 30k miles,btohqsg
I am confusedVantage is 4k in 30daysAltitude is 3k in 60daysRight?,btohqsg
Uob one card and absolute cashback,btohqsg
I feel is expensive l√†. Unless really can spend 3 to 4k... no point you pressure to spend this amount to get the miles,btohqsg
Seriously you say 1st time Dbs.. then go for Dbs world woman card,btohqsg
i can hit both cards criteria But just thinking which card has the best welcome offer currently for dbs,btohqsg
This one you can check with other bros and sisters in the group. To me even I got the money. . I go for dbs woman card is better...,btohqsg
You can just apply for dbs world woman. No need to spend $$ ...to hit criteria,btohqsg
But dbs wwcc only can clock 4mpd on retail right? As large chunk of my spendings on local F&B,btohqsg
Dbs woman world card.Use for online shopping.Can use book air ticket.Book things or buy at klook,btohqsg
If I not wrong the 2 cards you mention are both less than 4 miles card...,btohqsg
Seems like dbs wwc is my only last choice for 4mpd alrdy ( after uob  hsbc and citi ) ! Thanks man,btohqsg
Uob .. I only will go for woman card.. actually doesn't matter about category 2 for solitaire.Other category I can use citi rewards or hsbc revolution...,btohqsg
anyone received email from hsbc premier saying that you need to maintain minimum of 180k even though you applied for the 15k recurring transaction?,btohqsg
We hope you are enjoying the wide range of exclusive benefits and privileges that have been tailored to meet the financial and lifestyle needs of you and your family.To enjoy HSBC Premier privileges with no monthly fee  simply maintain a minimum of SGD180 000 (or its equivalent in foreign currency) in your Total Relationship Balance*. We note that you did not meet the HSBC Premier qualifying criteria  but we understand that your lifestyle is dynamic  and so is the flow of your funds. For this reason  we waived the service fee of SGD50 for that month of May 2024.To avoid the SGD50 service fee from June 2024  we encourage you to meet the minimum Total Relationship Balance of SGD180 000 by the end of this month. If you are an HSBC Premier customer in another country/region  kindly inform us for the purpose of updating your status as you will be eligible to enjoy Premier in HSBC Singapore with no minimum Total Relationship Balance.,btohqsg
Remember to apply the Woman Card too wor‚Ä¶ 2mpd for $1000 spend. Better than general spend card wor.,btohqsg
u applied for 15k transfer when applying for premier status and did the 15k transfer monthly but yet got this email?,btohqsg
I tried to cancel HSBC Premier but they refused to cancel lol,btohqsg
What you mean. I already have uob lady card. Only the solitaire card 10k salary too hard to apply,btohqsg
This card good too. You can get.,btohqsg
its a matter of time if any of those spending are manufactured. But having said that  based on your cashback  $12k spending is not a lot  maybe they will close one eye.,btohqsg
Hi hi want to askI recently paid my credit card bill 2 days before due date but cos bank takes 2 working days to process. In the end got charged late fee  then I asked for waiver but now my bill has interest charge alsoAny idea if I can ask bank for waiver of interest charge too? üò≠ halp,btohqsg
You are given close to 1 month to pay bills yet you chose to wait till the last 2 days to pay it off?,btohqsg
If can use the FAST method next time if you are going to play it this close but it only applicable to‚Ä¢ OCBC‚Ä¢ Standard Chartered‚Ä¢ DBS‚Ä¢ Citibank‚Ä¢ UOB1 Add your credit card 16-digit number as the account number when adding a FAST recipient in your banking app2 Select the bank your credit card is from3 Transfer money to this as if it were a bank accountSource from sethisfyhttps://sethisfy.com/how-to-pay-your-credit-card-instantly/But as samsam did say you know it going to take 2 or more working days  should always consider buffer time 4-5 days counting working daysIf it your first time maybe they give you the first time late wavier but it all depend on the bank,btohqsg
How do u manufacture spending? My average spending at my friend's pub a day is 500.. If go other places then even more.. This monthly total cashback indeed is not alot but still better than nothing.. Just like all those videos trying all the ways to show add up a month get cashback $1000 as passive income its just a sense of achievement.. Nobody really need that 1k...,btohqsg
I beg to differ. If this cashback as passive income + other passive can fully cover my expenses monthly technically means I‚Äôm living on 0 expenses. It‚Äôs a pretty huge net to cast to say nobody needs that additional 1k,btohqsg
Glad you know that your spending is not a lot contrary to your earlier statement that you're spending a lot. There are many whales here who will not showoff their spending but I know many  including myself  spend easily 10x or more of what you're spending and nothing to be proud about really,btohqsg
He means 1k nothing to him,btohqsg
Ya at this point  it just sounds like a flex that he‚Äôs showing his statements  getting hotel upgrade from casino  moe scholar. Doubt anyone actually asked about his back story. I know so many successful people yet they are humble,btohqsg
Haha oops  probably yes since he semi retired liao.,btohqsg
In order to get this cashback need to spend that amount it will never fully cover your expenses to be living on 0 expenses. Just like sales u save more but actually u spent more.,btohqsg
I was just sharing that letter to alert others who might fall into the same pitfall until people assume and talk rubbish then i share photos to prove a point. Of course there r many whales around and the higher u go the more u see n the smaller u realise u r. One night out with kim lim one will see what she spent in one night is what others cant even earn in an entire year... Thats just an example...,btohqsg
Mind u  4mpd only for online spending. So if you tab at restaurants physically  0.4mpd i think.,btohqsg
Why this though. Go for world. I dont think u need 80k to get it as long as u have one cc with dbs,btohqsg
Oh no... I recently just applied thinking that just by doing the 15k transfer is enough to maintain the status. üòÖ,btohqsg
How long have you been holding the account? If so everyone will be receiving wor,btohqsg
How do you guys earn interest from hsbc ega ? It‚Äôs only for incremental balance and limited to 2 months   right ? 3rd months onwards nothing. Am I correct ?,btohqsg
Hi all  heymax voucher e.g. Pet lovers center earn 1.9MPD. If I buy items in store without utilizing vouchers  I'm getting 4MPD using my card. Why is this even useful? I rather earn 4mpd paying $100 in store than buying $100 worth of vouchers to get 1.9mpd value,btohqsg
I believe that is on top of your credit card rewards,btohqsg
That's why we need to keep rotating our funds to other banks or to another ega account.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs still a 2mpd for online spend after you max out all your 4mpd cards.,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  planning on payment for taxes. May I know what‚Äôs the best hack out there that can earn some benefit?What‚Äôs the best pairing with ipaymy  card up or Citi pay all?Keen to hear from gurus here. TIA,btohqsg

Vantage seems attractive for welcome offer,btohqsg
I tested with my wife and friend. If u are new to the bank  vantage will appear in your card list from the app.It seems like the 120k limit is not that strict for new to bank customer (not 12 month coool down),btohqsg
Assuming the spending criteria is not an issue  but i would like to go dbs/ocbc cc   should i be going vantage?,btohqsg
Yes . The trade off is 4K minimum spending.Unless ur income is 120k then no issue to play the cool down etc,btohqsg
Personally  I would go for DBS vantage and then play the cool down trick and apply for DBS altitude 2 years later,btohqsg

Anybody can explain the changes in Rewards Summary table from HSBC Revolution statement?Why did I not earn any bonus points? And I only earned 135 points,btohqsg
Anybody can explain the changes in Rewards Summary table from HSBC Revolution statement?Why did I not earn any bonus points? And I only earned 135 points when my statement with mostly eligible transactions amounted to $400*HSBC Revolution gives 10 points per dollar for eligible transactions. (4000 points for $400),btohqsg
Time properly bro. I was shocked when vantage approve instantly!,btohqsg
Anybody can explain the changes in Rewards Summary table from HSBC Revolution statement?Why did I not earn any bonus points? And I only earned 135 points,btohqsg
You shld have spent $135 this month right?,btohqsg
Is approve immediately  and i can start spending via apple pay before receiving the physical card right?,btohqsg
Yes bro! So see when is ur big ticket spending then apply imo,btohqsg
If it reflects as $135. Means only 135 is eligible.I had a long conversation with HSBC last weeks. That was how it was explained to me.Bonus miles will only be credited in the following month! But there‚Äôs a chance that this bonus will not reflect in your next month statement too!,btohqsg
I am planning to purchase a sofa with a budget of 800-1000. Using UOB platinum paired with Kris+ to purchase voucher stacked the miles on top of the Kris+ miles bonus?,btohqsg
If i change the statement date  it will not appear any points in my 1st adjusted statement ?,btohqsg
Yea. The bonus points will be credited by next calendar month! So the following month end you willl cfm see the bonus miles credited.So let say your next month statement generated on 15June. But bonus miles was credited on 25june.You will see ur bonus miles statement on 15july.So best is to track on your own.Upon hearing this  It‚Äôs damn messy imo,btohqsg
This was my understanding from HSBC last week and I‚Äôm waiting to cfm this. FYI,btohqsg
Ahh I see. I understand the bonus points now. Hmm but thats weird because I'm pretty sure most of my transactions are eligible. Is there a way to see which of my transactions are eligible?*Edit: Oh no i realised most of my food transactions were not eligible fromwhatcard.sg,btohqsg
Hsbc revo still useful for food? Went to a ramen place thought is 5812  end up is 5814...,btohqsg
But yet their cap is based on calendar month right ?,btohqsg
Please check your eligibile spending again. FYI they made some changes to the MCC code. Like grocery AND fast food are not considered .If all are eligible  it should be 403 credited to your statement given x1 base point.If you are unsure abt the transaction. U can call the bank or use heymax/amazelike what@ChrisHMSGmentioned in his videos! Very informative and useful.I think he got a referral code for both,btohqsg
same bro... i eat at koufu alot and now i realised koufu is also 5814 which is not eligible,btohqsg
Do anyone know if grab wallet top up consider qualifying spend ?,btohqsg
I see  thank you very much!,btohqsg
5814 is fast food ya? Soo ya lorrrr needa see alr,btohqsg
wow really huge nerf. much more than I thought,btohqsg
Food court. I think better to use amaze card,btohqsg
In my opinion.  Use hsbc only for restaurants such as crystal jade  imperial   paradise group.,btohqsg
I think ill use SC Smart card for Koufu from now on.,btohqsg
SCB Smart Card no bonus for Koufu though,btohqsg
Ooo I thought fast food is eligible?,btohqsg
Selected fast food like Mcd  Burger King etc. Read the tncs please.,btohqsg
I dont think SCB Smart card is eligible for Koufu transactions,btohqsg
5814 is not fast food only. Most of small restaurants/hawkers/food courts/KFC/McD/Starbucks ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ all use 5814 for its credit card transactions..,btohqsg
Too risky use Revo for f&b now  better change to other card,btohqsg

What 6.6 sales does sc smart merchants have lol,btohqsg
Just wan to get their welcome cashback,btohqsg
Oh but you will probably lose out on the bonus points,btohqsg
No choice. Then the following mths focus on bonus üòÇ,btohqsg
$200K but must go branch set,btohqsg
$$ too big can't do online,btohqsg
Can set up a maximum max limit of $50000 via app. Anything more would be going to their branch I guess.,btohqsg
Anyone tried bigfundr before? Thinking whether to put some money in,btohqsg
It‚Äôs micro financing. Tied to credit risk of guarantor.,btohqsg

In my opinion. Uob preferred platinum visa is no longer an all rounder. Must take card.An all rounder must take is.Citi rewards. Paired with amaze.,btohqsg
But i think u need to align ur goal first ba. Whether to save moolah or spend. Tbf being fresh out with a cc  u will be tempted to spend and overspend ur means,btohqsg
im just doing cc research coz my current DC will expire by 01/2025.just some broad general research early on.,btohqsg
Are you going to spend 600 monthly right after starting work? Seeing how you are looking at evolNot necessarily to have a uob one account but if you can spend 500 consistently then yes for the higher interestAs a fresh worker   I would prefer to get a ocbc 360 account as the requirements are easier for bonus interestFor first credit cards  I would go for something no annual fee as a base with no min spending.,btohqsg
Good2. Saving wise  uob one acc and cc r best saving strategy imo. Any cc with no minimum spend is good,btohqsg
speaking of no annual fee  i just chanced upon this from one of the videohttps://www.sc.com/sg/credit-cards/smart-credit-card/likely i will KIV this one.,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 for more straightforward usage,btohqsg
This is a good card but the cons are it‚Äôs a very specific list of merchants accepted but at least the merchants are quite common used. So if you do spend on those  then for sure,btohqsg
Diners card is fine..... when I have my first job. I use diners and citi student card credit limit 500,btohqsg

or in simplicity  shld I just not think of new Credit Cards until 1 year later when I have more reserve?how practical is it to go thru all this for cash back?,btohqsg
For a start if you really want a credit card  look into cards that doesn‚Äôt have any minimum spending,btohqsg
ok thats a good start.like that I will srsly consider the SC credit card alr.,btohqsg
Like for myself  my spending every month is less than 500 or it‚Äôs not a consistent 500 that I can accomplish every month  so currently I can only go for cards that don‚Äôt require min spending to hit the bonus rewards like hsbc revo or sc smart,btohqsg
Ohh ok  coz some singsaver cards need to spend within 1 month to get the rewards  dunno how long it will take to receive the physical card to activate,btohqsg
Yes... agree no point force yourself to spend unnecessary just to hit minimum spending,btohqsg
Usually Dbs is 4 working days.Uob is 1 to 2 weeks.Hsbc is 3 weeks.Scb is about 1 week,btohqsg
no need wait   just create ibanking account to activate and spend if got virtual cards,btohqsg
u can start with a cashback card for simplicity sake and work your way up. are you more of a offline or online user?,btohqsg
Can create ibanking account without any cards or savings account with them?,btohqsg
i think minimal need one product with them at least,btohqsg
UOB PPV is a good start,btohqsg
Buying stuffs via Amazon web qualify for uob one 500spending?,btohqsg

Too low imo. Or sbs or tbill,btohqsg
Tbh buying gold bars to hold be better choice,btohqsg
Evol would be a great addition. but as others have pointed  you need 3-4 months of payslip. Otherwise  you might have trouble applying for the same product if and only if the product was rejected due to insufficient documentation.,btohqsg
gold better for long long term compare to ssb/tbill those kind? but much more volatile also,btohqsg
Not recommeding or speak for others but my own experience  gold is safest bet.,btohqsg
yes  if u paying using eligible credit/debit card,btohqsg
Are T-bills both ‚Äúcapital & interest guaranteed‚Äù ?,btohqsg
Maybe you try uob evo card,btohqsg
T bills very low interest rate risk if referring to 6 month Singapore t bills,btohqsg
I thought gold price now high already,btohqsg
You try singlife 3%.. I feel is ok,btohqsg
Dont think it will drop anytime soon. Might as well ride the bull,btohqsg
"Is anyone using CardUp to get miles on your ineligible payments? I saw the extra charges are at 2.25% which is significant. Makes me feel like I am ""buying"" those miles. May I know what are your motivations for using CardUp and in what use cases will it be v worth it?",btohqsg
I guess that means MCC codes not in that list of MCC codes would not be eligible for bonus? Example Toys R Us is 5939 which is not in the FAQ list‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Correct. If you don‚Äôt see the MCC under the chosen category means no bonus.,btohqsg
Yes cardup is for you to buy miles. And you can use their calculator to calculate the cost of buying miles. Gen card with good earn rates (1.4-1.6 mpd) and discount code (eg visa for income tax) will make it worth.,btohqsg
My motivation is im buying the miles,btohqsg
is there a cardup vs ipaymy article?,btohqsg
"""Please be informed that we are unable to use digital bank as your bank account for credit salary.""Hi Everyone  my company HR replied that they r unable to add Trust bank for my salary.  Wondering if there anyway I can Giro salary to Trust by myself? Register a company and can juz open a biz account workable  then able to Giro salary to my Trust bank?  Any experience? Much appreciated. Quite wasted if can't Giro salary to Trust as got additional 0.75% bonus interest.",btohqsg
Recently I receive cashback using Trust card  is this something new?,btohqsg
Digital bank is not allow . I think this maybe extended to momoo   singlife and endouws too,btohqsg
have you max out the other bank accounts already?,btohqsg
Yes  if really can't Giro salary to Trust. Then hv to find alternative similar or better to trust.,btohqsg
"If ""most"" companies unable to Giro salary to employee's Digital bank like Trust  then Trust still requires Giro salary  like purposely.",btohqsg
Got OCBC UOB Maribank and GXS.,btohqsg
But your ocbc doesn't have salary credit right? So can credit there and earn interest.,btohqsg
i think what you can look at is cimb fast saver  but it works similar to hsbc ega based on fresh fund then additional 0.5 on salary credit,btohqsg
OCBC can credit salary by FAST now. So no nid giro.,btohqsg
Will check it out. Best would be to able to Giro salary to Trust.  Plus Union member can get 3.5%.,btohqsg
yea digital bank is still pretty much a new area that they havent explore about. i tried asking my company for it too but they mentioned banks with physical presence allowed then bobian  giro into ocbc,btohqsg
name is stated in the picture,btohqsg
Paisey  I wasn't clear. I'm referring to insurance payments  hospital bills  Amaze top ups  etc. Basically those in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
I see. So it's general card with good miles rates + discount codes that will make it worth it. Thanks for sharing.Coz I was using the calculator and my annual expense is roughly ard $50k. Then I saw the admin fee was like $1250 üòÖ,btohqsg
If I empty my account today will that be fine? Instead of yesterday,btohqsg
Because banks refer to their t&c and not someone's else's website.,btohqsg
Yup it all depends on how you value miles. CardUp is for you to buy miles for paying certain ineligible transactions. You always want to capitalise on their promos. 1.78%  1.88%  etc.,btohqsg
You need to top-up more when the promo comes. Your MAB is already minimum of 10k (if you have 150k yesterday). Unless you can turn back time and empty your account yesterday.,btohqsg
Paying for insurance  electric bills etc sp bill  keppel electrics will earn you miles using air miles card and also certain cash back card,btohqsg
"I did mention ""certain ineligible transactions"".",btohqsg
Your baseline will be (day 1 + day 2) / 30 days if you empty it today.Eg. Your end day account balance is $100k yesterday.Your Jun MAB in will be ($100k x 2) / 30 days = $6666.67,btohqsg
Alamak‚Ä¶. I top up 150k on 15th May. Means I won‚Äôt get 1000 bonus for rising phoenix promo?,btohqsg
Like that look like better I empty my account today?,btohqsg
Your Mar MAB is 0 right? You registered in May right?,btohqsg
March I got 1K. May top up 150K,btohqsg
Balance now is 151K. Basically register in 15th May,btohqsg
Then wait for earmarking in Jun...,btohqsg
I just found out that the uob lady‚Äôs card UNI$ split into 3 parts.Base UNI$ per transaction.Bonus UNI$ at start of next month.Bonus UNI$ for $10000 in lady‚Äôs account is at 27th of next month!Any experts can confirm this?,btohqsg
Next month. I thought already effect in May already,btohqsg
Guys and ladies. Need help on this . If I have biz boarding pass in Dec. Can I enter one world lounge in T1 or 2 ?,btohqsg
Your boarding pass is from which airline?,btohqsg
Is SQ in One World alliance?,btohqsg
Yea May start  bonus receive on June.,btohqsg
That is what I think so. Those who bought GV movie ticket cannot enter Cathay cinema to watch movie.,btohqsg
if u registered in May  the funds will earmark sometime 3rd week jun assuming u maintain 1k+earmatk amount from 31 May till it gets earmarked,btohqsg
Ladies account don't need to keep so much $$. 10k is just enough to get 6 miles,btohqsg
But if they count by average daily balance means ((1K x15 day) +(151K x 16 day))/31day = 78K average balance? Meaning I won‚Äôt get the 1K earn mark bonus for rising phoenix ?,btohqsg
Anything is possible if you look confident enough üëÄ,btohqsg
Just keep 150k + Mar MAB all the way until they end earmark. Unless you say as of today you already less than 150k + Mar MAB.,btohqsg
Or no such things? I‚Äôm confuse. lol,btohqsg
already given u the full summary,btohqsg
Oh okay. Thanks a lot for the advise,btohqsg
Hi ladies.So if means even biz boarding pass can't go in one world lounge ?,btohqsg
You ask the guys liao now ask the ladies?,btohqsg
You need to have a one world biz ticket to go to one world lounge. Yours is star alliance.,btohqsg
I was literally going to ask this question as I didn't get any bonus from the savings account! thank you,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know if I can apply a joint account for uob lady savings account?,btohqsg
Have to call in and find out  as it is not stated on the websites and such I assume is no. I will be applying for uob stash joint,btohqsg
Anybody knows if Citi rewards card support payment to Telco such as TPG/Simba as it is MCC 4814 on heymax and is not in the exclusion list on citi rewards,btohqsg
I been using it to pay my StarHub bills,btohqsg
I use amex ascend to pay too,btohqsg
Also if you are using StarHub star plan recurring and their buy now pay later it also rewarded for Citi rewards,btohqsg
No. I go to their starhub website to pay .. using ascend,btohqsg
Because I ask 3 times . They refuse to give me their payment detail. Unlike singtel will give,btohqsg
To me it doesn't matter if earn 0 miles... not a lot of $$. 40,btohqsg
Actually why not use their app ?They have a payment page ?,btohqsg
Apps last week have error. Can't log in,btohqsg
I told them . I need payment detail to pay either at citi pay all or card up. But the starhub people don't understand,btohqsg
Not surprised  alot of people dont understand u at all,btohqsg
many ppl wont understand what is citi payall or cardup,btohqsg
If I empty today from $151001 to  1001  my June Mob I need to have $151001 + $150000? To entitle the MAB,btohqsg
Making payment using citi pay all or card up.. can't understand?,btohqsg
At least when I ask singtel. They understand.  They send me payment details for payment citi pay all,btohqsg
Like I said  your Jun MAB as of today is at least 10k. If Jul's promo is based on Jun's MAB  then you need to top-up on top of Jun's MAB. Keyword is if.,btohqsg
I mean they email me my request,btohqsg
no need keep 1001   can just empty everything,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt understand why don‚Äôt you use 4mpd card to pay the bill directly(means you earn 4miles per dollar) but you prefer to pay additional 2.6%/2.25%/1.85% admin fee to earn 1.x miles per dollar instead.,btohqsg
I think they want to avoid the fall below fee. I kena negative value on my UOB One for not having 1k.#dp,btohqsg
You are so kind to reply.. üòÖOp isn't sui g right. I tot I am starting to see different forms of similar character.. oh no,btohqsg
How to earn miles pay starhub bill... I using amex ascend. Doesn't have also doesn't matter already. I give up asking,btohqsg
To me it doesn't matter. Those expenses that goes through Giro.. I all using citi pay all/ card up,btohqsg
Have you tried paying through their website/app??????,btohqsg
Go n apply 4mpd card. Search chat history ‚ÄúStarHub card‚Äù to see which card give 4mpd for StarHub bill payment.,btohqsg
That's why I no more use Giro,btohqsg
Yes. I paid through starhub website,btohqsg
Then why you want to pay through whatever other means?,btohqsg
I thought it don't earn any miles ... bro...,btohqsg
lol. That‚Äôs my question too. We seeing patterns.,btohqsg
They are not same person but they seem to think similarly.,btohqsg
Actually those small expenses such as transport.. I feel doesn't matter whether can earn 4 miles or not,btohqsg
Perhaps you want to indicate which promotion you want to participate first.,btohqsg
Nowadays I am not like 2 years back so hard up on it anymore,btohqsg
Oh dear.. my brain playing tricks on me. It's really a class by its own.. üòÖ,btohqsg
Would assume preparing for the not-yet existent promo.,btohqsg
Did u change nick? Were u here 2 years ago?,btohqsg
I think OP series of dp look familiar,btohqsg
he already have like 10k MAB  will not incur fall below fee,btohqsg
More than 1 person feel u are Anh. Is that true?,btohqsg
Is not feel. Can search one.,btohqsg
I didn't!! I just tagged Sourabh! üôÉ okok I better don't talk too much,btohqsg
Hi Experts: Has anyone used First trade broker for US Stocks and Options trading?,btohqsg
Seems like they offer $0 commission trades for stock and Options as standard.,btohqsg
even his username not same as his display name lol,btohqsg
So based on this  for 100K tier  can I assume UOB one is the most effective / safest option?,btohqsg
If 100k just go for HSBC EGA  SCB eSaver or CIMB FastSaver,btohqsg
On which day uobone credit bonus interest?,btohqsg
If you've searched the chat  you'll get the answer 2nd working day,btohqsg
2nd business day. should be tomorrow,btohqsg
Yes  can  but maybe not all banks,btohqsg
I signed EGA and successfully got an account last week. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. From my understanding from the TNC  the bonus is 3.45% on 100k for eg . cause I transfer 100k from UOB hence it is fresh fund.I would also need to transfer 2k in to HSBC every month + 5 pay now transaction to get the bonus.Is that correct?,btohqsg
the 2k in and 5 transactions is for additional 1% interest from everyday+ rewards. by transferring in 100k u already met 2k transfer in  so just need to do 5 transactions e.g. FAST to other bank,btohqsg
Ohh okay. So I just got to leave the cash in and that‚Äôs it?If I have a big ticket spending from the 100k I deposited in   will i be eligible for the 3.45%,btohqsg
still get 3.45% on the incremental monthly average balance wrt the reference month. btw u registered for the promo in which month?,btohqsg
Got the EGA successfully im may,btohqsg
But haven‚Äôt send the sms yet,btohqsg
Just send now in case you forget. Next month just move to somewhere else will do.,btohqsg
I got a burning question.For the HSBC EGA registration.Does it need to be you yourself that send in the first 9 account numbers?Or can it be like I help my wife to send using my mobile number? (Let‚Äôs say she stuck in China  and does not want to incur the $0.50 or using ZYM mobile),btohqsg
Yes like Melvyn mention will anticipate for possible promo next month,btohqsg
if u sms in jun then the 3.45% will be on incremental monthly average balance wrt May,btohqsg
Ok then shall wait for July promo to see what is the start date,btohqsg
think need to be account owner mobile,btohqsg
@emilyong11your account opened last week haven't deposit anything in yet right?,btohqsg
Can try  at most they reply you say registration fail.,btohqsg
I deposited 2k inside to sustain,btohqsg
Still ok  can just dump the rest in and register for Jun. üëçüèª,btohqsg
GG. Then those ZYM mobile user how? üòÇThanks. I bring her SIM card back to SMS lol,btohqsg
What if it‚Äôs in the 2nd joint account EGA?Both husband & wife name. Which mobile number in this case? üòÇ,btohqsg
What about ZYM mobile? You can SMS with standard overseas SMS rates.,btohqsg
Hello! Any recommendations for paying your renovation costs to company don't accept credit card? Like cards up or ipaymy,btohqsg
Depends on the primary account holder.,btohqsg
Any idea what's the fee? Or any promo code I can use?,btohqsg
I wanna earn miles. Any card recommend to use cardup website to pay,btohqsg
Use general spend card  uob prvi  etc.,btohqsg
Cardup doesnt earn bonus points for specialized card. Re: hsbc revo,btohqsg
If I sign up credit card using singsaver  then use cardup to pay for renovation. Will I entitle for the singsaver promo?,btohqsg
Ah really? My wife ZYM now totally no network in Shanghai.,btohqsg
You are guy. Put lady pict right,btohqsg
That's a whole other problem then haha,btohqsg
Do you guys think I should cancel my HSBC Revolution? Cannot find any use case for it.,btohqsg
Why cancel? It‚Äôs a zero annual fee card with no min spending. Can just choose to just add it to your mobile wallet and don‚Äôt bring outUnless you say after the cool down period then you want to apply for another hsbc card for the rewards then probably yes,btohqsg
I scared the MCC rules keep getting reduced... =(Now  tbh  I rarely use this card now.,btohqsg
Nerfs are always gonna happen  it‚Äôs a matter of when only. If you have other cards enough to cover the mcc and your spending can be covered by those cards max cap then can cancel. Imo  doesn‚Äôt hurt to keep the card since no fees or min spending to maintain it,btohqsg
I'm keeping my HSBC Revo for grab rides  flight and shopee/lazada. If you want to cancel then 1y apply new to bank  that works too.,btohqsg
Yeah I agree  just keep the card.Sometimes will have some spare uses for it.And after all no AF.,btohqsg
Yes. I am thinking of the 1y apply new to bank,btohqsg
Because this is the card for restaurants,btohqsg
That concept I applies to scb,btohqsg
Maybe OP has UOB lady‚Äôs card for restaurant?,btohqsg
I have multiple HSBC Entertainer from each HSBC cards.HSBC PMC = Entertainer PremiumHSBC Revo = Entertainer StandardUsed to be very useful for Venchi stack with AMEX 10x  and Hoshino Coffee which my son likes.,btohqsg
A bit Jiak bah liao  just like nerfs  boost also sometimes can happen also.But then your personal choice,btohqsg
Have some risk of being small brokerage. And platform really lousy. Need to use other platform to research and charting.And take note they make money through other way such as charging high fee for transferring funds out etc. And many different charges.Data lags.Do take note my info is out of date. Used it many many years ago. Have change since. Better to refer to their own website.,btohqsg
Yes and atome too. My spending can hit 1k cap of crmc easily so hsbc revo is useful to help absorb some expenses. To each other own spending.,btohqsg
Does auto atome bill give bonus pts for revo? Or need to manual payment?,btohqsg
My experience is different  my code for atome is coded according to the merchant  not 5999.Not sure abt the rest,btohqsg
I see woman dbs card a matter of time bonus miles may down to 1k or 1100 follow citi rewards/hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Uob lady card bonus point will remain at 1k... this is fair enough,btohqsg
For Webull Moneymarket fund  if u activated SGD   u can't use USD ? only one or if I happen to convert some SGD to USD  I can have both running ?,btohqsg
Which merchant was it? A few times I checked it was 5999.,btohqsg
I always trigger it manually at the start of the month so I can't comment. Some data point on crmc not recognizing atome auto deduct as online so I don't wanna risk it.,btohqsg
For watever reason  now SCB keeps rejecting my application even with high credit rating,btohqsg
Despite having some reserve USD ( Exchanged ) it somehow doesn't subscribe into the USD one   I know that I cam RSP manually but that doesn't count toward purchasing power and can't redeemed automatically when u wanna buy some stocks,btohqsg
maybe i keep applying and closing previously some savings accs for the newbie offers.,btohqsg
Why you open saving and close scb,btohqsg
You should just keep there. Like the bros say here open hsbc Ega account. In my opinion . Should keep there. Don't remove fund off unnecessary,btohqsg
On this subject  if I have posb everyday credit card at the moment   am I new to DBS credit card?,btohqsg
Refreshment of funds in between accs,btohqsg
I will cancel this card soon. Already found replacement,btohqsg
Anyone has issue with Amaze card on Google pay?,btohqsg
"Mine was suddenly ""removed"" from my Google pay. I can't add it back.  It says card not supported.",btohqsg
Did you apply for another bank's card recently?,btohqsg
"There is this ""2% interest rate subsidy yield coupon"" from Moomoo.  Does anyone know what it is and how to use?  Thks",btohqsg
Maybe you can read the tnc of the coupon?,btohqsg
Why though? This is one of the easiest and most versatile 4MPD Card. You only need another secondary card to handle online purchases.,btohqsg
Hi how scb calculate within 30days? On 2may i transfer out 20k. Tnc say cannot transfer in within 30 days. I made incoming on 1jun 50k. Is it within 30days? This is for esaver acc.,btohqsg
Hey bros  anyone knows if uob one account auto close after 3 consecutive months with zero balance?,btohqsg
Have read abd not clear to me.  I will ask Cs then.,btohqsg
Do they calculate daily average ?,btohqsg
Yes...my reason same as chris... always need to spend my than 5$ then get rewarded 4 miles,btohqsg
My replacement for this card is citi rewards master,btohqsg
That makes sense then! Citi Rewards+Amaze will cover everything that UOB PPV can do. As long as the 1k per month limit is sufficient for you.,btohqsg
Usually I don't spend much on citi rewards. Because I still have ocbc rewards.. I spend it on supermarket   guardian and watson,btohqsg
Wonder if Maybank will auto close bo....,btohqsg
From 2may to 1jun is it within or over 30 days?,btohqsg
Hi guys! Would like to check  what would be the best miles card for utilities? Notably that most banks have utilities exclusion!,btohqsg
Uob one bonus interest is in. Correct figure is $503.21 for $150k mab in May 2024.,btohqsg
Correct me if I am wrong. Only canCiti pay allCard up.Scb 1 journey card,btohqsg
Then wait for couple of months before applying,btohqsg
Can no longer use the salary hack?,btohqsg
Yes. It works. Mine just credited in few seconds ago. 1 hour slower than the rest.,btohqsg
Still works. Did my own transfer as salary payment and it tracks.,btohqsg
Be careful of supermarkets. Still advisable to use general spending card eg. Dbs attitude card,btohqsg
Yea lo.. can‚Äôt be tracked but don‚Äôt gv bonus interest rite?LOL,btohqsg
But your screenshot shows Jun. What's your question about??,btohqsg
Today only Monday  give sometimes for the tracker also  maybe late for work.,btohqsg
No la.. just to ensure it‚Äôs eligible before I go ahead to make my spending,btohqsg
Ocbc rewards card may not earn bonus miles,btohqsg
Good day  I wish to seek some advice on webull promotion  if there is a step by step guide to get the joining rewards.  Thanks,btohqsg
So better in my opinion to use these 2 also ok. I just remember.Citi rewards.Uob ladies . Category . Family,btohqsg
of cos  the card dun reward 4mpd for groceries,btohqsg
Think this is poor advise leh.,btohqsg
Supermarket has so many good cards  the last I would think of is DBS Altitude,btohqsg
Sorry bro... I over look it.I put up earlier post.So better in my opinion to use these 2 also ok. I just remember.Citi rewards.Uob ladies . Category . Family,btohqsg
Best supermarket hack   no card needed .. buy at lotus JB .. at least 30 percent cheaper hehe,btohqsg
can still use card what ü§´,btohqsg
I mean don‚Äôt even need to use card already so much cheaper,btohqsg
Think this is poor advise leh.So many high cashback / miles cards to cover groceries.,btohqsg
I use maybank fnf for that lol  i go econsave haha,btohqsg
Agree but can't be every 2 to 3 weeks go JB,btohqsg
Why not  some ppl who find sg too ex travel each week in to buy stuff like milk powder  pamper etc,btohqsg
Got people every weekend go in lol,btohqsg
Yup  looked through it before that. Unsure if getting journey card just for utilities is worth it? Given that I do have the sc smart card too!,btohqsg
Different purpose between journey and smart card,btohqsg
I think few things to consider would be1. Orphan points (if you're purely using it to pay utilities only) you wont get much out of it to redeem something2. If points are pooled  if yes  then probably ok if supplemented by others,btohqsg
Im using them for different purpose Smart card for utilities and subscriptionsNot sure if I should get journey for payment of utilities (only).,btohqsg
The SMS doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs says invalid keyword. Anyone knows why?,btohqsg
Thanks for the response! If pooled just solely from smart card and journey (only utilities)  then unlikely it‚Äôs sufficient right? :‚Äô),btohqsg
Points from smart and journey don‚Äôt pool anymore.,btohqsg
Got people every 2 to 3 days go JB.,btohqsg
Did you send in this format?PMAF 123ANo extra spaces or text,btohqsg
Hi anyone have used card up to pay for utilites provider Geneco before? I am unable to find the bank details to input in card up. Any advice is appreciated üôè,btohqsg
You need to use desktop mode if you're setting the payment up on your phone to see electricity category.,btohqsg
U can just use card in the app  why need to use cardup,btohqsg
Hi  any eligible cashback credit cards for health insurance payments? Under Great eastern insurance. Thanks,btohqsg

Beware of scb not waiving annual fees.It is my most hated credit card bank now.,btohqsg
Anyone knows what is finance charges. I just saw it on my HSBC cc bill,btohqsg
Interest Loh. Did u have rolled over or amounts u paid late?,btohqsg
No lei.. i always pay early,btohqsg
What I know this means outstanding not pay in full. Bank interest charge ...,btohqsg
Ok this one I suspect only.Could be u used Hsbc card on merchants deemed as cash advance.,btohqsg
If no sms or email  most likely application didn't go through. To check  call their help line.,btohqsg
Keep us updated. I‚Äôm curious. Thanks.,btohqsg
Did you use your scb credit cards? Cos my experience with scb is that they will always waive off the annual fees.,btohqsg
any idea if we can use climate vouchers for dyson fan?,btohqsg
No more LiaoYes I‚Äôm active user especially scb manhattan cards,btohqsg
Oh no. I still have their Manhattan credit card too.,btohqsg
It took me 6 calls to setup online banking  which I didn't have to even call once for any of the other banks.,btohqsg
Be prepared for no annual fee waiver.I use $6 667 every quarter without fail. I will know result this month. Have one annual fee this month end.,btohqsg
Might be their plan to remove this credit card for good.,btohqsg
Take note that insurance can only make up of 50% of the tier you're hitting. And you need to hit 3 months consecutively.,btohqsg
No. It applies to all their cards for me so far.Even simplycash,btohqsg
Did you pay in full (i.e. not minimum payment)? Can ask for fee waiver then pay off in full.Deferred one maybe cash advance  check your transactions if you accidentally transfer out/withdraw money out from your card instead of account?,btohqsg
My suspicion (unconfirmed) they want to kick out priority banking customers who do not maintain $200k assets with scb.,btohqsg
Yes if merchant accepts climate vouchers.,btohqsg
Ok‚Ä¶ so it is indeed charges for not paying in full.Bill was $685 but I paid $658.A stupid mistake.But thank goodness they will waive it off for me,btohqsg
Nice. Thanks for updating us too,btohqsg
Mine just got waive last month and I‚Äôm not a frequent user.,btohqsg
Just to check if you have hit 200k AUM yet they refuse to waive?,btohqsg
Hsbc ega interest when is it coming ? Anyone received alrdy ?,btohqsg
as not a lot of cards allow utilites payments to earn miles,btohqsg
got it thanks. I actually mean the bank acc details for Geneco/Seraya energey as on their website  bank transfer isnt one of the options so wanted to pick the brains of the community :),btohqsg
got it   looking if any UOB/DBS/Citi cards allows,btohqsg
And which card was your AF waived for? Sorry if I didn't catch it earlier.,btohqsg
CardUp has their bank details  why do you need to key in manually?,btohqsg
Have you checked if your cards are eligible for rewards on CardUp transactions?,btohqsg
uob one card eligible for cashback for geneco,btohqsg
Which bank is the best to keep $100k if I‚Äôm just waiting for SGDMYR to go up and convert $85k ? Ocbc is good but hard to manage the SAVE portion since exceeded 10k,btohqsg
Will I kena fall below fee for transferring everything to another bank ?,btohqsg
‚Äú(iii) that are not withdrawn from any existing UOB current/savings account 30 days before or duringthe Promotion Period and re-deposited (whether part or all the amounts withdrawn) into theAccount indicated in the Registration (as defined below).‚ÄùDoes that mean I should put $155k on 2nd July instead of $150k on 1st July due to this clause?If I have transferred out the $150k on 1st June.,btohqsg
Someone sharp highlighted this new condition for Uob plunging chicken.Was it there all along?,btohqsg
Like hsbc gives most % on ‚Äúincremental balance‚Äù so have to find another bank to transfer everything over so can start over from initial balance $0 again,btohqsg
Is there any cons using uob privi miles card?,btohqsg
Should be somewhere in current tnc,btohqsg
Yes. Annual fee. 261. Spending cap 1000 each for 2 months to get the miles.,btohqsg
This means those ‚Äúmaximisers‚Äù who go and withdraw the funds before earmark is completed (usually few weeks delay) will fail condition. Maybe that‚Äôs why got some people didn‚Äôt get earmarked.,btohqsg
Lower earn rate than specialized cards (1.4mpd than 4mpd),btohqsg
Bros and sisters. Which are your fav bank in spore now.For me is HSBC,btohqsg
Depends on the promotion of that month/quarter,btohqsg
No I don‚Äôt have   they ask me to topup,btohqsg
I think you are right! ü´°Then that clause is supposed to explain the termincremental fundsto the customers‚Ä¶ ü§£ü§£ü§£https://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/save/common/terms-and-conditions-savings-promotion.pdf?vid=na&pid=CD07Q2SAVE24,btohqsg
Hahahha I understand liao.It is for those that have $1001 now  next month join promo and put $150k in.Then when earmarked $150k  they go and withdraw the $1001.I‚Äôm also not sure if I‚Äôm correct lol.‚ÄúNote:(a) For existing Accounts  the Incremental Fresh Funds must result in at least a correspondingincrement in the Account‚Äôs day-end balance throughout the Promotion Period and Earmark Periodas compared to the Account‚Äôs Monthly Average Balance for March 2024.‚Äù,btohqsg
Ya. By right cannot touchReference month mab amount $1001Earmark amount $150 000Total $151 001 cannot be touch throughout entire promo.,btohqsg
Same experience as me.Hostaging us. Topup to $200k or else we cannot waive scb pb vi anymore. Ok this one I can accept because it is after all a pb card.But when u also don‚Äôt want to waive my peasant $30k simplycash by using the same $200k aum requirement ‚Äúencouragement‚Äù. I cannot accept it.Anyway as a tip. Scb smart has no annual fee for life. I just apply for that to hold my scb credit limit. In the event I need to cancel all my scb cards except smart.,btohqsg
Ya. Let‚Äôs see who go withdraw in the next promo. üòÇThink I remember last year got people go and do swapping.Like $100k now  then join next promo $100k so now $200k  once the $100k earmark; they withdraw the $100k that‚Äôs not earmarked.LOL.It‚Äôs those people who June still $150k now  and never withdraw. Next month whack $150k more.,btohqsg
Aiyah they want to risk then risk Loh.Maybe end up Uob cannot track and they succeed?I will always be kiasi kiasu aunty and play safe.,btohqsg
So just top up and not touch until earmark is released should be safe?,btohqsg
Yes. I will do that. With like $10-11 buffer.,btohqsg
‚Äúthat are not withdrawn from any existing UOB current/savings account30 days before or duringthe Promotion Periodand re-deposited (whether part or all the amounts withdrawn) into theAccount indicated in the Registration (as defined below).‚ÄùYou see my bold words‚Ä¶If the user withdraw on 2nd June $150k‚Ä¶And the new promo start date is 1st July‚Ä¶.2nd June to 1st July promo start date is less than 30days.Only those who withdraw the funds on 30th May is safe!Those who withdraw on 1 Jun is 30 days or 31 days? üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Wah‚Ä¶ brain fried liao. UOB ah UOB‚Ä¶ üòÇ,btohqsg
To be honest I cannot remember if this is a new clause or there all along.Maybe the 30 days wording is new.,btohqsg
Hahaha. Promotion period starts on day 1 of the month liao.*UOB Big Savings Payout Promotion (‚ÄúPromotion‚Äù) is valid from 1 April 2024 to 29 June 2024  both dates inclusive (‚ÄúPromotion Period‚Äù),btohqsg
New clause.Anyhow  next month maybe UOB add more T&C then everyone BBQ liao üòÇ,btohqsg
wah really squeeze till like that ah,btohqsg
I feel put in Hsbc better,btohqsg
Hihi  I checked milelion but just wanna double cfm if I am correct.Can I still earn 4mpd if I use UOB preferred platinum cc for medical bills by pay wave via Google pay?,btohqsg
Ya‚Ä¶ my final finally understanding is that those people who withdraw last day of 30 May is safe only.Lose 1 days interest but safe.Those who withdraw on 1 June is also not safe because they withdrew from existing UOB accounts.This guy who write this 3rd clause is a genius sia. üòÇüòÇüòÇ30 days before promo start 1 July is also means the whole 30 days of June month  cannot withdraw.Ha‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
WLWLWLBBQLCan only go UOB ask liao when 1st July dropping chicken come out liao. ü§£,btohqsg
Just a gentle reminder.Elite miles earn on ground . Will be until tomorrow last day.,btohqsg
Previously I ask here about hsbc 1 travel card annual fee . On 31th May . They charged me 180,btohqsg
Means spending on merchants from kris pay . Elite miles earning on ground will be until 4th june,btohqsg
"If someone transfer from UOB  savings account say $51k to an external bank  registered ""One Account"" for the promo and transfer $50k in from an external bank. By definition from the clause 1.6 (III)  it wouldnt qualify  but how is UOB able to detect? Unless they are doing a total MAB across all your accounts as comparison. That would be alot of investigating work.",btohqsg
Applied SC card from singsaver since dec and fulfilled all the conditions but yet to receive the $300 or so .. Is it normal to wait for so long,btohqsg

For arranging giro credit card payment via EGA  do I need to inform HSBC before submitting the forms at the various credit card banks?,btohqsg
The clauses are written in such a way it can interpret widely and to the bank advantage. Do as much hoops as possible so it is not easy to pick up. Now with AI advancing  such behaviors or patterns can be pick up Ex: Transfer out and transfer in from the same external bank is a red flag  transfer in/transfer out of big amounts only in the months when promotion going to kick off is a red flag.  The bank wont tell what is their algorithm to detect such,btohqsg
Bros. How about those under hdb flats private clinic.  Does citi rewards card qualify 4 miles ?,btohqsg
Need to see under what mcc. Private should be yes?Cuz i always pay using my amaze+crcm TCM,btohqsg
On a worrisome note  dont be surprised if they decide to change the clauses for the salary fast in method. But I will put that less likely as I believed many people including myself deposit money into UOB because of this method.,btohqsg
Its true. AI can help. Have to invent some exception scenarios... like to transfer from UOB to Bank A  then Bank A to B and then from Bank B using a spouse or family member's account back to UOB again! üòÇ,btohqsg
That is a good mention. The clauses also never mention the names of the accounts specifically whether must be the same person. Of course  that depends if UOB has your family member names and their relationship and then they can track between external bank and between UOB accounts of the family members.  Especially if you use the person A and B method. In short  we need to be prepared if one days all these nerfs and AI detection comes in. Just enjoy while it last.,btohqsg
I am sure they already knew. Its a matter of whether they want to shut it down. Which means turning away customers and shoveling them towards competitors.,btohqsg
Agreed. My view is they may not want to close salary FAST loop hole as this bring customers to deposit new funds into UOB. But for promotions where people use existing funds  that is where they may tighten the criteria.,btohqsg
Thanks. But I think need to submit signature as opening account was online?,btohqsg
Ya need to go to hsbc branch to provide signature,btohqsg
Hi  intending to sign for chan bro(travel) tour package (10k+ transaction).If I use Amaz+citi rewards   do I still get 4mpd?Or not rewarding as my transaction still under travel category?,btohqsg

It‚Äôs ok. I not hard up for Uob promo. I still have Hsbc EGAs.,btohqsg
30 days before promo period is the killer. Thanks Mx for highlighted. I would have been caught off guard too,btohqsg
Means those who moved out on 1st Jun cannot take part in whatever new chicken promo ah?,btohqsg
Topup only on 2nd July if u moved out on 1st June. Higher amount. $155 010.,btohqsg
Bank count by dayend balance right. If withdraw till 1000 on 1 jun then can ah. 1 to 30jun consider 30 day? 1 jul is the 31st day?,btohqsg
