My mum removed all 100k ystd. So now account is $0. So now need to put $10 back into the account based on ur advice?,btohqsg
Only end Apr then you get earmarked (supposedly)  how to withdraw? Even if you withdraw after the earmarking  they might claw back the cash credit. You'll have to keep it all the way till end Jul.,btohqsg
Now is 10.18pm. If fast in and can reflect immediately. I see no harm.,btohqsg
The last time i asked the same question  got mixed reply. Some sat yes  some say no. (Best is chat in to uob to get the confirmd answer),btohqsg
Which promo u plan to take part in. I‚Äôm not sure what u mean actually.,btohqsg
Registered in Feb  base on 1 month 3 week  the earmark is around mid Apr ?.,btohqsg
No need but if she wanna play safe then go ahead. Now still today's transaction if you transfer. 9 mins left.,btohqsg
But your 31 Dec balance is $100k?,btohqsg
Based on all the previous discussions  UOB CSO have a 80% hit rate for wrong answers unfortunately lol.,btohqsg
So how are u meeting the condition that throughout the earmark period  you maintain31 Dec + $100kWhich is$100k + $100k?,btohqsg
31 Dec balance is 100kNow add 100k so this is the fresh fund,btohqsg
Earmark for Feb registration is end Mar. You need to keep 200k+ inside if your 31 Dec is 100k already.Now is Mar registration  if you haven't gotten earmarked yet. You still need to keep 200k+ inside till Jul if you insist of doing rising dragon promo.,btohqsg
So are u going to maintain $200k till earmark period ends?,btohqsg
Oh crap.. then did anyone managed to appeal successfully if CSO give wrong advice?,btohqsg
Why not just transfer out now and wait for Monday's promo  if any?,btohqsg
If balance is 200k now  isn't only the 100k new fund is earmarked ?.,btohqsg
What is the condition u need to maintain?,btohqsg
Check the t&c  it states clearly you have to keep whatever your Dec 23 bank statement says till end of the earmarked period.,btohqsg
Ok. So i dont tsf $10 laüòÖ since $0 is fine,btohqsg
Then it doesnt make sense to join the rising dragon. U easily could earn $300 per month in anywhere else with the extra 100k top up. Why go for rising dragon that only give u $558?,btohqsg
Is fine.. many keep it $0. Just make sure it's 100k + the base interest on 1 Apr.,btohqsg
OK  will just empty out and wait for next round,btohqsg
or rather read the new promo TnC (if any) first,btohqsg
Rather complicated with this uob dragon thingy..haha,btohqsg
We all know when they release the t&c it's already past the to transfer date ü§£,btohqsg
If I am not wrong. The reason why I never keep an account I‚Äôm playing with at $0 is there is a bank that clearly specified the bank account cannot be at $0 to be participating in the promo.Since then I never left any playing account at $0It is not Uob but there certainly was such a bank,btohqsg
I mean may not be $100k in in Apr,btohqsg
Should be another.. because they allow new accounts to join and they start at 0 anyway..,btohqsg
That's true... Maybe 50k only ü•≤,btohqsg
Maybe up to $150k to match new Uob one?,btohqsg
#dpSaturday  10:31pm still considered on the day transfer for FAST.,btohqsg
"Btw.. mind i i ask..why do u guys reference ""10.30pm"".Is it uob officially state that it will recognise transfer after 10.30pm to be the next day? Or is it just an estimate base on experience?",btohqsg
U ah. Still recommending JIT masters.,btohqsg
Just for own research only ü§™ anyone want JIT and end up missing the promo then too bad,btohqsg
Based on experience. The banks won't care because to them the money is marked as transferred  but their promos and interest calculation will still follow the actual transfer date.,btohqsg
So.. possible or impossible for these scenario?1) there is a possibility transaction before 12am  is marked as a transaction for next day?2) there is possibility a transaction after 12am is marked as a transaction on the previous day?,btohqsg
The last time I tried 11pm is already next day.,btohqsg
#dp10:35pm to 10:40pm likely is the cut off timing for FAST. Please don't be a JIT warrior.,btohqsg
How about 2). To me i tink it doesnt make sense. So i tink its impossible. Just wonder if any experience before.,btohqsg
Won't. Anyway now transactions are for Monday already,btohqsg
For ocbc  they do update their ledger balance on saturdays  ie. they recognise transactions on saturdays,btohqsg
Same for all banks  it's a business day.,btohqsg
Then i am confused why u mention this? üòÖ,btohqsg
Nothing confusing. It's literally means what I said. Now transactions are for 1 Apr.,btohqsg
Oh haha. Thank youüëçWow u really do alot of experimenting. Thank you for helping to update!,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt keep doing small amounts to test until bank call u up to ask why u keep doing multiple transfers.,btohqsg
huat la...next one: rising phoenix promo..haha,btohqsg
Hahaha ya sia. I stop liao...,btohqsg
i 10cents transaction + void 3 times..card tiok blocked..loltesting my visa card machine..nnb..lol,btohqsg
Later both banks call me thought I trying to DOS their network,btohqsg
This one if I'm the bank I also block... Like pretty sus if you not there in person,btohqsg
Btw.. the cut off timing is for uob only? Or is it nationwide? (Ya i can test with my ocbc) i am just wondering it there some central control where a flick of switch  all banks change into next business day.,btohqsg
ya sia..keh kiang troubles to get replacement card..haha,btohqsg
Yes for UOB only. DBS still show 30 Mar.,btohqsg
Lol  you are right. ocbc also  still show 30th march. Later the banks ban the two of us. So sus keep transferring small amts lol,btohqsg
It's likely the rest is 11pm while UOB is 10:35pm-1040pm. HSBC also showing 1 Apr before 11pm.,btohqsg
Confirm have. I think is rhb,btohqsg
"So there is no central switch. All banks ""knock off"" at slightly different timesüòÖ",btohqsg
DBS still reflect 30 Mar after 11pm. Maybe in the morning will update as 1 Apr. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
If after 12am  still reflect as 30th march then will be super wierd..,btohqsg
Don't think you can transfer from 12am-4am because of their daily maintenance. I might be wrong,btohqsg
Got someone live chat Uob Cso. 1st April onwards maybe everyone can apply lady savings account. Not just females.,btohqsg
Later end up the CSO kuku thought they meant the card ü§°,btohqsg
wah uob one account cash rebate and cashback masuk liao,btohqsg
Hmm can‚Äôt see anything yet. But usually after 11pm Uob systems quite wonky one.,btohqsg
Hihi  for those hv uob lady‚Äôs solitaire card  do u hv any issue to waive the annual fee?,btohqsg
Yeap looks like wallet by budget baker,btohqsg
What happen if I applied separately  am I losing out on anything?,btohqsg
UOB one account interest credited but still not yet one bonus interest credited.,btohqsg
I transferred my UOB One account balance to my other account on 30th March at 7 am  leaving only 1K in the UOB One account. However  when I checked now  it is now not showing $0 as the monthly average for March; instead  it is showing the full amount  like 50K. Why is this happening?,btohqsg
anyone received cashback from SC on 27/1 marked with 52CASHBACKLNY  I have no idea if any promo,btohqsg
Morning all  if I make a card transition on 31 Mar  but the transaction gets posted on 02 aprWill I get miles/cashback for Mar or Apr? Thank you,btohqsg
Why need to empty UOB one account?,btohqsg
Not true  it is depend on what bank card u use,btohqsg
Hi all..apparently i was charged 1% convienience fees when i auto reload from trust to tng card ? Anyway ard it ? I was paired on savings accts not credit card,btohqsg
Posted date within the calender month,btohqsg
the bank doesn't process on weekends  hence people transferred out on 28/3,btohqsg
Not true  sat is a working day unless it is public holiday on sat,btohqsg
UOB Stash account interest in today  remember to withdraw by today.,btohqsg
TnG charges 1% on Credit Card top-up,btohqsg
Hi moomoo users. Does any one know how this moomoo yield coupon works?Is it similar to the 6.8% guaranteed return concept? (Except its only 5%  max 10k and for 10days only)Anyone has any experience on this?,btohqsg
So using iChange better ? Considered as debit card ?,btohqsg
No way to withdraw out today. It will be treated as withdraw on 01 April.,btohqsg
Maybe check again if you're paired with Trust card instead,btohqsg
Withdraw today still will be considered as Apr's withdrawal,btohqsg
I just keep only $1000 in my UOB one account and the rest I withdraw on 30th March at 7am but still the monthly average balance for the month of March is $50k not $1K.,btohqsg
Your MAB won‚Äôt be zero but your day end balance will be zero.,btohqsg
Right... And the math is correct.. what's the issue? üòÖ,btohqsg
Should be EDB at $1000.. haha,btohqsg
Do know the difference between MAB and end of balance and what in the tnc is asking for.,btohqsg
You understanding is correct  click use before subscribing to the eligible fund,btohqsg
Yes  but iChange like having some issues to top-up TnG for now,btohqsg
I think they disabled the feature. Got some announcement.,btohqsg
So we all can now see the Uob one base interest credited for value 30th March and there is no way to get the $4 out except on value date 1st April. So those who select rising phoenix $100 000 and keep only a $100 000.00 balance throughout will fail the earmark checking criteria which is $4 + $100 000 requirement.,btohqsg
Is it every quarter if UOB launch promo you will send reminder? ü§£,btohqsg
I try to share when I can Loh. Although still got people scold me being too naggy and repetitive as they don‚Äôt care about such small money.,btohqsg
But touch my heart I really feel happy when I see many people benefit.But also get a bit irritated when I already mention the clear (yes maybe kiasi) steps on how to do it but people refuse to follow and end up don‚Äôt qualify.,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ who will scold you wor.. you send already give 2 hours later ppl will ask again..,btohqsg
Please continue your sharing  I think it's a good reminder to those who are new to this savings promotion,btohqsg
"""In this case  the MONTHLY AVERAGE BALANCE for March 2024 doesn‚Äôt matter  but the end day balance only matters is it?",btohqsg
Lol u say rising phoenix. Sounds so confirmed that i went to google it. üòÇ,btohqsg
If you're going for UOB One bonus interest  then you need the MAB. If you're anticipating for the next promo  you need the EDB to be as close to $0.,btohqsg
Got it. Thanks but no where we can see what was our EDB right? As long us we keep minimal or empty before 6.30pm on 30th Mar should be fine?,btohqsg
But i was paired with my savings acct which is considered debit card rite ?,btohqsg
As long you transfer out to another bank by 1030pm then it's okay.,btohqsg
Ichange topup to tng suspended liao,btohqsg
U will know on 1st april.IF the new april promo get launched  u will pull out your march statement  and at the last line  u will see the EDB. Then do accordingly to the TNC of the new promoNo point thinking about it now. There is nothing u can do now also to adjust your EDB anymore. Enjoy your weekend.,btohqsg
This is debit card settings  rite ?,btohqsg
Did you check if you set to credit card or debit card before you top-up?,btohqsg
How to set to debit card settings pls ?,btohqsg
I am in savings acct but apparently should be considered debit oredi rite ?,btohqsg
If you're already paired to savings account and it still charges you 1%  maybe you should check with their CSO why it's still being charged as credit card ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt credit/debit is determined based on card number? I thought linking to savings works as ATM card  not debit.,btohqsg
Did you check the transfer date?,btohqsg
It is only about source (credit or saving). TnG will recognise the card as a credit card based on card numbers,btohqsg
Maybe ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è if they used the BIN to check.,btohqsg
So meaning cannot use trust card to top up or auto payment  ? Unless pay the 1%,btohqsg
Can try YouTrip to top-up but got mixed dp where some say can  some say cannot. Even YouTrip themselves recommend linking YouTrip card to TNG eWallet.Alternatively is buy tng reload pin on another platform but it adds risk of getting scammed by the 3rd party.,btohqsg
what's the reason for transferring out please,btohqsg
To maintain MAB for the most optimal 3% interest. But too bad today's Sunday  the base interest will be counted towards next months MAB.,btohqsg
If my friend only transfer out her 100k today is it too late?,btohqsg
Gg already. If tnc of new promo is same as old. Cannot participate efficiently,btohqsg
Ask your friend transfer back in and try again in Jun lolSame thing  Jun also end on Sunday ü§™,btohqsg
Jun can watch another round of JIT warriors ü§£,btohqsg
We can only try to remind and prompt Loh.,btohqsg
"There is a promo that we have speculated will happen that will reference 31st march end day balance number. If its zero  then any extra amount put in after 1st april will be considered as ""fresh fund"".Can goggle uob read up on ""rising dragon"" promoReason for transferring immediately out on the day it is deposited in  will mean the day end balance remain the same as before.Mainly this is done for those who has MAB at 100k in their account. Because any extra above 100k will have pathetic returns",btohqsg
They're talking about maintaining MAB for UOB Stash account  by withdrawing the base interest.,btohqsg
My friend ask me isn‚Äôt it End of day balance? Why if transfer out now can‚Äôt get participate efficiently,btohqsg
Because UOB transfers after a normal Saturday 10:30pm considered next business day.,btohqsg
Hi  for Citi PremierMiles Card;1. Do you earn miles for hotel and flight bookings2. Can you tag with Instarem Amaze card for evad FX charge and earn miles spending overseas?,btohqsg
Dependent on the bank. I always assume Saturday 11am to be safe. (I‚Äôm Kiasi type).,btohqsg
Hahaha to discourage JIT warriors also,btohqsg
Just put 101 000 in la to cover the bonus interest as well,btohqsg
After 100k got no bonus interest lol,btohqsg
This mth bonus interest not in yet ma,btohqsg
So play safe just put 101 000 in to cover,btohqsg
This month's bonus interest is based on this month's MAB. Nothing to do with depositing 101k in Apr?,btohqsg
They just credited 3.98 for base interest in ma. So to get earmarked sucessfully u need to put in 100 03.98 ma‚Ä¶ but just in case this mth bonus interest also in on 1 apr which normally will only in on 2apr. So to play safe just throw 101 000 in can cover all,btohqsg
Don't get it... The math don't add up sorry üòÖ not sure why you making things complicated..1 Apr just make sure got 100k + base interest (top-up to $10 also ok) then don't touch can already. At most withdraw the bonus interest on the day it's deposited.100k gets you full 5% EIR  if have promo then can register for earmark  don't have promo withdraw anything above 100k. Don't have to think what just in case lol.,btohqsg
I usually do $100 500 until earmark happens but that‚Äôs just kiasi me. For most people $100 100 and totally untouched until earmark happens should be fine.Just don‚Äôt 100 000.00,btohqsg
Hi.. anyone know the mcc code for express cafe and bar @ holiday inn express & suites Singapore novena? Heading to their Teochew buffet later,btohqsg
Hi all. Would to confirm if using CRMC via Paywave (Apple/Google) is considered online and eligible for 10x points.,btohqsg
No. Paywave is contactless  not online.,btohqsg
Whoa thanks for the fast reply. Looks like must use Amaze.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs the whole point of Amaze.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a little troublesome cos can‚Äôt add Amaze to Apple Pay. Using iPhone.,btohqsg
I thought this reminder makes sense. Should withdraw whatever deposits that is made to the stash account on the day itself before end of the day. Otherwise  the MAB keep piling up over 100k and the excess earns pathetic return.(for this month  u have up to 1st april to do it  because sunday is non working day),btohqsg
Question. Amaze card is going to charge 1% on local transactions from 1 April.1. Is it still worth it to link it to other credit cards?2. Any other better options?,btohqsg
1% only when u spend above $1k1. Yes it is still worth as it converts your spending to online for bonus miles,btohqsg
Thanks. Sad; it used to be free. I linked it to UOB Krisflyer card.,btohqsg
For OCBC 360  can the $500 spend come from debit card?,btohqsg
same i used the same method but it doesn't rlly bother me as my local spending on categories im KF card rarely goes above $1k.Travel and general spending lies on my Ladys and Privimiles,btohqsg
but u can just spread ur spending so u wont incur the 1% fee,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 websites did provide a list of cards that eligible for $500 spend. You may want to visit the website to see if the card you hold eligible for it..,btohqsg
Unfortunately they don't care for when you can do it. For Apr  they'll see your statement balance for Mar  which is based on 31 Mar. And the base interest (which gets deposited after FAST transfer cut-off timing) will also be part of Mar MAB since you can't transfer out on 31 Mar.,btohqsg
Sorry for the many qn haha. Can ask what‚Äôs the earning rate for lady‚Äôs card that is not the chosen categories? 0.4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi moomoo users  may I ask for my 5% fund plus yield coupon  do I just select any fund and will guaranteed the 5% return for the 10days? Is there anything i shd beware of when choosing?Since its guaranteed  shdnt i just choose the highest return fund (>10+%)  since its going to minimally earn me 5%? And at best case  earn me the 10+%?,btohqsg
Better than pay by cash üòâ,btohqsg
I just temp park at moomoo for 100k  withdraw on 7th April get $100.,btohqsg
Hi all. Thinking of signing up for moonoo (new user) for 6.8% sign up‚Ä¶ understand that the promo is over on 1 apr 2024 10pm  if i sign up today am i able to do in time? Any one familiar with how long the whole process takes of funding the account and putting into moomoo cahs plus?,btohqsg
I am curious why moomoo is the only platform that offers such attractive rewards compared to Webull and Tiger.ü§î,btohqsg
Have you read the TnC n check is it suitable to you?,btohqsg
Have read about the company  just abit uncertain about the custodian being not held with like UOB etc,btohqsg
Can search through the group chat to see what's the experience is like,btohqsg
Then u alrdy got ur answer. Invest directly with UOB üòä,btohqsg
How to participate?  I didnt receive this and also didn't see this in my account.,btohqsg
Does anyone know when they are giving the Cashback for the DBS takashimaya amex card? Made the min spend of $250 but didn't get the Cashback,btohqsg
I see! So what u mention means uob recognise the deposit of this month end's interest into their MAB and end balance subsequent computations. But any transfer you attempt will be futile (and is actually not recommended to do so for those whose EDB and MAB is a crucial criteria for bonuses) because it will not be recognised due to the non-working day.Please correct me if i am wrong.,btohqsg
Yes you can read UOB Stash account t&c on how it works,btohqsg
Thank you for the information!Lucky is only the base interest. Get stuck is not so heart pain. If its the bonus interest  few hundreds every month will stack up quite abit.,btohqsg
Hi can anyone explain how to maximise grab points without paying the monthly subscription? Like what's the difference between pay later and grabpay?,btohqsg
If you have cards like UOB One card then to maximise is not to top-up and pay with Grab Wallet / pay with Gray PayLater / any methods that earns you Grab points in one way or another..,btohqsg
Sorry  I don't understand. So.. don't top up what exactly? I do have UOB one card,btohqsg
You're losing a lot of cashback for your UOB One card if you're doing any of the above.,btohqsg
So just tick this option eh? For example 4776 is my UOB one card,btohqsg
Yes  remember that UOB One card gives up to 15% cashback for non Grab Wallet top-ups (including Grab PayLater).,btohqsg
Wah okay man.. yeah I've been doing that for the last 3 months. Thank you for the redirecton üëç,btohqsg
Very easy way is to check is realising your additional cashback for Grab is gone,btohqsg
How to check this? I don't think I've had any Grab cashback throughout the time I used it üòÇ,btohqsg
Track on excel? You should be tracking your spendings to make sure you don't end up not hitting the tiers,btohqsg
What tiers are you referring to? the UOB one $500 min spend or got some tiers to hit within grab?,btohqsg
Are you or are you not using the UOB One card? üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Ah ps.. let me try to share w you more details about my situationYes  I am using the UOB One Card.I am lucky that my lifestyle has no issues with hitting the tiers of crediting $1 600 salary and hitting a minimum spend of $500/mth thanks to my insurance and investment payments.My main motive of signing up with UOB was simply to get the interest which is a lot to me compared to POSB üòÇSo now I'm just trying to explore and see how to get other perks such as cashback  miles  etc.,btohqsg
Thks.  But I don't have any of those.,btohqsg
Like when you apply for UOB One card  you did check out how the cashback works right? üòÖ,btohqsg
I did but I did not pay much attention to the cash. Was more focused on checking whether my insurance/investment payments would be counted under the $500 min spend.I have checked it out on the website and understand better now. Thank you for your questions and redirection. Appreciate your time.,btohqsg
I think you're confusing all the different cards altogether...Are you using UOB One card or UOB One Debit card?Are you able to hit $500/$600withoutinsurance/investment/any non-eligible payments based on the different cards t&c?,btohqsg
I am using the UOB One Debit Card. At this juncture  yes I am still able to hit $500/$600 Min spend without the insurance/investment payments.,btohqsg
Hi  i opened a new uob one account on 5th of march and participated in the rising dragon. I put in $115k inside to maintain MAB of $100k.Just to double confirm  can i withdraw the 15k tmr? Just dont touch the base interest and the one account interest first right?,btohqsg
If you're able to hit consistent $500/$600 without insurance/investment payments  you can look into the UOB One card or UOB EVOL card for better cashback. Assuming you are eligible for these CCs.,btohqsg
You received the registration email for the participation of rising dragon of 100k right? Then yes  you can withdraw everything until 100k.Your EDB for 31 Dec is $0 since you opened on 5 Mar this year.,btohqsg
Ok.But i read someone saying ystd  just to play safe dont withdraw the base interest first. So only for exisiting account holders dont withdraw base interest is it?,btohqsg
Yes. You need to understand the logic behind why you should or should not withdraw... Not just see ppl say then copy  it might work out against you üòÖ,btohqsg
Ok haha thanks cos quite confusingü•π,btohqsg
The 100k should not be touched until it's earmarked  and I suggest don't withdraw the cash credit also (to play safe  even though I think people have withdrawn and nothing happened  and t&c said just participating amounts + EDB).,btohqsg
Noted Melvyn. I am looking to apply for one of the CCs too to build my credit score.If I'm not mistaken UOB ONE Credit Card has a minimum monthly spend of $2000 requirement which I cannot hit.For UOB Evol Credit Card  how can I maximise it?Considering UOB Lady's card too considering that it has no monthly spend requirementI see that there's some sign up offer on singsaver too üòÇ,btohqsg
cash credit is ok to withdraw..as long as keep to the TNC which says:Maintain 31 dec end of day balance + earmark amounts throughout the promo.,btohqsg
For UOB One card:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/167432You can search YouTube for Chris' video on UOB One card vs UOB EVOL card.UOB Lady's card is a strong card if you choose to accumulate miles instead.,btohqsg
"""Till its earmarked"" - you mean start of earmark right?But how do i know when the ear marked has started? I dont see the 100k inside my account being greyed out.I did receive the confirmation email",btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163442Available Balance will be $100k less than Current Balance.,btohqsg
I submitted the rising dragaon form then i transferred $115k inside. But now i still see $115k tho. When will it show as $15k?,btohqsg
Wah. I didn‚Äôt see the interest came in on 30th.,btohqsg
So it meant  won‚Äôt be able to participate in promo anymore.,btohqsg
4.5 more hours to rising phoenix! haha,btohqsg
if you have been reading the messages  you will know receiving base interest or not  would not affect your eligibility.,btohqsg
I tot must be zero sum by 30th March. PS  I am wrong.,btohqsg
Ohh. I see. Thanks for highlighting!,btohqsg
Kinda answering your question more directly  if you're able to utilize credit cards for Grab services  it's pointless to care about grab points as you need to pay using grabpay wallet to earn grab points. Linking a card such as how you did should net better rewards given you use high cashback/miles card like UOB One credit card. Minimum spending for One is $500 for 3 consecutive months  the $2000 tier just gives a higher cashback rate.,btohqsg
Noted  thank you all for your time responding üëç,btohqsg
30th but after 1030pm. So you can't even take out on time. But it won't stop you from participating what.,btohqsg
Ya.  I was confused by the T&C. I tot needs to have 0 dollar by 30 March 2024.Thanks for sharing that the interest is credited after 10.30 pm on 30th,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt need to have $0 on 28th March or whatever is the specified date.U just need to have a very small balance.Because how earmark promo works is you will need to maintain:The small balance + $100k throughout the entire promotion period.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sorry newbie question how to sell my CDP account share via DBS Vickers ? The App keep telling me they I don‚Äôt have sufficient trading limit  but I do have 30000units on my CDP account may I know which step I‚Äôm doing wrong üòë thanks üôèüèº,btohqsg
Ya. Thanks for clarifying. I get it already.,btohqsg
Your sell limit is only $100.70.https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/investment-vickers-increase-trading-limits.html,btohqsg
Nope. I personally tested last FAST transfer is 10:40pm yesterday.See my transfer at 10:42pm:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183982,btohqsg
Mean I have to transfer money in first then only can do the sell trade ?,btohqsg
Either that  or provide income statement for credit review  etc. You will get a better answer from DBS CSO.,btohqsg
Question. For UOB Visa Infinite card  is there a monthly cap  or it is like the uncapped UOB Krisflyer card?,btohqsg
Hi all I bought a handphone from authorized mobile shop distributor called ‚ÄòMistermobile‚Äô online via payment link. And the category on my DBS woman world card appeared as ‚ÄòBills utilities taxes‚Äô‚Ä¶. Which is weird cos it‚Äôs after all a ‚Äòretail shop‚Äô‚Ä¶ any idea if this means bonus points were not captured?,btohqsg
My guess would be the shop is coded under a telco equipment MCC which DBS broadly categorizes as ‚ÄòBills  Utilities & Taxes‚Äô. Similarly to if u pay a telco bill using WWMC.Whether it awards bonus ultimately depends on the actual MCC. U can check the MCC via DBS digibot.,btohqsg
The MCC might still be 5999 if you check it onheymax.ai. Can also verify with DBS digibot like what@Xris88mentioned.,btohqsg
"after checking the MCC  can i know what do i search for on dbs digibot? cos i tried searching smth like ""does MCC 4812 qualify for 10x bonus points on dbs woman world?"" and the answer was irrelevant",btohqsg
No need check. 4812 is not excluded for WWMC. U‚Äôll get the bonus points as long as the transaction is captured as online. U can see whether it‚Äôs online when u click on the transaction in-app.,btohqsg
oh great  i spoke to customer service officer on dbs and they told me all these telco MCC arent eligible for bonus points haha,btohqsg
nope but its based on what heymax said for similar phone shop distributors. im still waiting for merchant to reply on MCC to double confirm,btohqsg
what do i search on digibot to find the MCC of a merchant?,btohqsg
Merchant? Digibot should be telling you what's your transaction's MCC or at least Merchant Category under Check Recent Transactions.,btohqsg
Digibot ‚Äî>Check My Recent Transactions>Credit Cards>Select the card you used>View Transaction History>Pending Transactions,btohqsg
Glad we have more data points of CSO failing,btohqsg
thank you! i do see it is MCC 4812! And I also went to check on telco bill  its 4814 - which on heymax is also eligible for the 10x bonus points. Wondering if the customer service officer was saying wrongly then? Cos he said all these telco bills not eligible,btohqsg
I checked the t&c  no where said telco retail purchases non eligible lol.,btohqsg
As long as I confirmed that a merchant‚Äôs MCC is eligible  and whether it‚Äôs online/contactless payments  there won‚Äôt be any more exclusions to take note right? Meaning to say any merchants in this whole MCC code would be eligible,btohqsg
CSOs are known to be unreliable at times unfortunately‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Yup. As long as it's not excluded on t&c  safe to say it's fine.,btohqsg
Hi  for UOB one account  how long does it take for the card spending to be reflected?,btohqsg
i have hit the min $500 spend alr but many transactions are shown pending in the app,btohqsg
is it amt calculated by per calendar month? will i still be eligible for the interest?,btohqsg
Based on transactions posted within a CALENDAR month. If you are trying for Mar  probably won‚Äôt get because they are still pending.,btohqsg
Pending transactions do not count. If right now the spend tracker for your UOB One account on the app still haven't hit $500  you'll only get the 0.05% base interest end Apr.,btohqsg
hi experts  can i confirm if my understand is correct for UOB ONE:1) for 7.8% interest  the $500 spending is by calendar month2) for the usual cashback on the credit card  it's $500 by statement month,btohqsg
Likely you miss the boat already. If you search in the forums  it has been recommended that you fulfill the criteria at least 2 days before end of the month. And the fact now is weekend which is 2 days of non working days. Be wiser and try again next month.,btohqsg
Lol you need to reply to the right person,btohqsg
1. And$1600 salary crediting  not 3 GIRO payments. Yes postedby calendar month.2. Assuming forUOB One card  yes postedby statement month. You can request via UOB Chat Assist to change and sync up with your UOB One account  but may screw up the statement quarter thing.,btohqsg
I be mindful next time. Too many msg in scrolling through. But i hope at least  the user Yueyang will see it still,btohqsg
i see! how long does it usually take for spending to be posted? some of my transactions from 25 mar and still not yet posted.,btohqsg
im using the uob one debit card,btohqsg
Technically  debit cards are faster  but by experience merchants seem to clear credit cards transactions faster. üòÖ It all depends on merchants  I have transactions on credit cards made on 28 and cleared on 30.,btohqsg
Let me guess from my experience. You done your transactions on 25-Mar Mon. It will be 27 or 28th Mar before it is verified from pending on UOB one credit card account. Then it will be another 1-2 days for it to syn to UOB one saving account interest tracker. The problem is credit card transactions need to be verified unlike debit card transactions,btohqsg
Plus 3 non working days cos long weekend. So probably tomm morning should reflect,btohqsg
Xnap  Fairprice n kopitiam will  be gone for Revo holders.üò∞,btohqsg

Hello all  first time depositing money into my moomoo account.I am intended to place $80K into Moomoo Cash Plus to participate 6.8% for 40 days  but the promo ending at 10PM  1st of April 2024.Do I still in time to participate? Any advise on participating this promo? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Second question  I‚Äôm also intended to open a HSBC Everyday Global Account (EGA). But is that necessary to keep a $2000 in the account to avoid $5 fall-below fee? Or I can just leave it $0?Because my intention it to enjoy the 1% cash-back (transfer in $2000 and transfer out $2000 divided into 5 times to fulfils the criteria),btohqsg
Yes. $2000 is required to avoid if I not wrong.,btohqsg

whats a good miles card to use for groceries? i am using HSBC but gonna be nerfed :( my UOB Lady's card I don't want to choose Family category for groceries.,btohqsg
Gg for those who maintained their MAB until zhun zhun,btohqsg
UOB One account also nerfed anyway.,btohqsg
What is the next best card for Xnap via iphone?,btohqsg
Yea but with this is double impact,btohqsg
Yeah. So can just jump ship le,btohqsg
Now harder and harder earn miles... time switch to cashback lo!,btohqsg
Oh i thought Wwmc is block like Amaze for Xnap?,btohqsg
but $5 block right  so anything below $5 cant earn miles,btohqsg
no $5 block for the 9x points,btohqsg
I think the new meta is to empty UOB One on quarterend months (Mar/Jun/Sep/Dec).Then do the lock in promo for $150k tier which has the highest bonus %.Can play the promo twice yearly using this method.,btohqsg
lol provided uob dun change pattern again next quarter,btohqsg
Later become check MAB average of past 6 months,btohqsg
This assumes Hsbc EGA don‚Äôt cut. Otherwise u don‚Äôt have other places better than 4.44% pa eir4% pa on $150k+0.44% pa on $250 cash gift for $50k earmark on top of March $100k mab,btohqsg
what's the next best high interest savings account after UOB one account got nerf? or UOB one still considering ok to go for?,btohqsg
Not keen to lock in if the difference is not big  but that‚Äôs just me.,btohqsg
Hello  my Amaze link with Citibank rewards has been made a fraudulent transactions at a UNIQLO Singapore merchant at 12:05 AM just now. I'm uncertain whether I should contact Citibank or the Amaze center to report this issue. Could you please advise me on the appropriate course of action?,btohqsg
We have one month to think.,btohqsg
with the UOB quarterly promo nerf + UOB One Account nerf... not sure how viable this will be... need to do some calculations  but1) Assuming most ppl MAB for Mar = 99k to 100k (last day withdraw);2) Top up 50k to 150k and participate in quarterly savings promo for $250?- Apr month will get 5% on 100k  0.05% on 50k - May onwards gets 4% on 150k  + $250.not sure how this stacks up against others banks  etc. when you go into the details  but a heads up/tip for people who have 150k and want to continue with UOB One at 4% (honestly still not an absurdly bad deal also),btohqsg
Oh just saw this. yea. share similar thoughts,btohqsg
For UOB One account nerf  calculated:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/184381But not sure what's the new change for HSBC EGA promo that's being teased...,btohqsg
U never add in the earmark bonus? Hah.I estimated it‚Äôs 0.44% for $250 cash gift for $50k earmark (the only one that makes sense to me if already have $100k mab),btohqsg
stash acc still safe from nerf for earmark right?,btohqsg
No la never added haha. But yes if add 50k earmark make sense.,btohqsg
UOB One account still gives better interest rates than UOB Stash account after the nerfs. Lol.,btohqsg
My next thought would be if already under rising dragon $100k earmark. Can I do another $50k big savings earmark?,btohqsg
Should be can... But I think maybe after the earmark period  so probably 18 May onwards?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still thinking and weighing. From May.Uob one without earmark = 4% pa.Uob one with additional $50k earmark = 4.44% pa and it cannot be repeated LiaoMaybe too much trouble just move into HSBC EGA if it still can get above 4% pa with no lock in stuff.,btohqsg
Can open new account to do?,btohqsg
Can close the existing uob one account and open new one,btohqsg
those with less than 125k might as well all in t-bills after the nerf.,btohqsg
Can close existing uob one account and open new one and get $1000 for 150k,btohqsg
Oh no tbills COY next to die then ü§£,btohqsg
Hahahaha. Sure  if you closed it yesterday maybe still can.T&c clearly states that UOB can exclude you from participating without reason.,btohqsg
If uob drop rate  most prob all other will drop too. In line with expectation that fed will cut 3 time this year,btohqsg
Ah got it I read the tnc,btohqsg
Just enjoy while u can as usual,btohqsg
But i am surprised uob one pull the first gunshot this time round to start rate cut  maybe we will see more from other bank too soon.,btohqsg
I think unlikely for DBS Multiplier to cut rates. They already aligned with the nerfed rates... ü§£,btohqsg
For those empty out Mar month end for UOB  if pump in 100k back today  meaning the can only get the earmark for 50K getting the 250 cash credit?,btohqsg
Depends on what your MAB is. You can check back with excel with this method:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183200,btohqsg
Mar MAB is in the 90K range.,btohqsg
Then you can top-up 150k to get the 50k incremental tier for $250 cash credit and 4% p.a. interest from May onwards.,btohqsg
empty out 30 Mar or not dun really matter  since using Mar MAB,btohqsg
Haha oops luan liao. Just now I never included that ü§£,btohqsg
Hi guys is there a lag time between money deducted from cpf OA for T bill before it being transferred to cpfia? My CPFIA still 0 and money already deducted from CPF OA. Anything I should be concerned about?,btohqsg
after this NERF which will be the next best bank account for interest ?,btohqsg
If on 1 Apr to pump in 150k  the 50k will be only entitled to 0.05% and lost out the interest on this 50k,btohqsg
Yes correct. You pump back 100k today for 5% p.a. EIR and register for participation for May earmarking for $250 cash credit  then pump 50k on 1 May after the nerf for 4% p.a. EIR.,btohqsg
How abt pump in 100k on 1st Apr  do register on 15 Apr  then withdraw 100k out on 26 Apr  re-pump in the 150k to earmark for the 50k to get 250 cash credit,btohqsg
But all is not doom lah  if uob stash dont change the rate and u have extra cash still can put in there for saving promo,btohqsg
Don't get this plan. What are you trying to achieve? üòÖ,btohqsg
To optimise the 50k in Apr  as 101 000-150 000 in uob Apr has only 0.05% interest,btohqsg
I don't get the withdraw 100k on 26 Apr portion...,btohqsg
To participate for the new qtr promotion,btohqsg
Just register in Apr  and pump in $50k on 30 Apr,btohqsg
Otherwise  register in May and pump in $50k on 1st May.Basically see which period u wanna go for.,btohqsg
Register in Apr would make more sense. You get earmarked earlier and cash credit earlier to move elsewhere for interest.,btohqsg
But why withdraw? You should be topping up 50k only.,btohqsg
UOB PPV and UOB VS for NTUC Fairprice and Sheng Siong. DBS WWMC for Fairprice In-App payment. Amaze + CRMC for Giant/Cold Storage.,btohqsg
With the uob being nerfed so how much to deposit on 1 Apr? 100k? Then pump in $50k on 30 Apr?,btohqsg
Yes. But you already registered for Apr earmark right?,btohqsg
I will just pump back 100k for 5% interest for April first. On May  see whether can find any other better bank rate.,btohqsg
Yup  just not sure what Kriste wants.,btohqsg
See whether other banks nerf as badly as UOB ü§£,btohqsg
Yup i registered the eaarked for Apr for my account.My mum account has not registered for any earmark yet.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm still earmarked till mid May. Will put in $50k on 1st May then empty the account on 1st Jun to prep for Jul earmark promo.,btohqsg
Basically if already registered for earmark just now  doesn‚Äôt matter if deposit 50k now or 30 April right? It‚Äôs still eligible,btohqsg
So for my mum  pump 100k on 1 Apr then register or register first then 100k pump or sequence dosent matter?üòÖ,btohqsg
If SCB Bonus$aver not nerfed in Jun can get 4.13%  then 50k stick somewhere else.Nerfed.,btohqsg
Yup  have to evaluate when the time comes but I got a bad feeling for the HYSAs‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Can I clear the AC zero on May   then pump in on June for the promo?,btohqsg
"""Just now"" still refers to 1 Apr right? If you're okay to get only $2 in interest for your 50k  you can deposit now. Or you can put into Maribank for $120 more.",btohqsg
What's your mum's account MAB in Mar? This will affect whether she can participate with 50k fresh funds for the new promo.The most important is to maintain 100k in Apr to enjoy the last month of 5% p.a. EIR.,btohqsg
"The next promo is ""forecasted"" in Jul. If you want to wipe out  also wipe out for Jun?",btohqsg
GG liao...rising phoenix becum fainted phoenix,btohqsg
Same promo. Promo end 29th June. The MAB base on previous month or end 31st march,btohqsg
fresh fund is incremental amount compared to Mar MAB,btohqsg
Hi all  I am confuse here. I thought HSBC nerf travel  but I check heymax it say Singapore Airlines is ok  means some travel still can use HSBC?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the card I give my mom to spend on groceries so that we can travel üòé,btohqsg
We could only move in 100k today and think for our next move later. It is a great move by UOB to lock in more cash by using MAB of the month of March instead of 31 Mar after their rising dragon promo üòÇ,btohqsg
Important is today MUST move in 100k. Get that last 5% p.a.,btohqsg
For new to group: Remember to complete Shieldy bot verification and wait 24hrs before posting links/media (no problems if you're just sending text).,btohqsg
Maybe they want to test water and see the participation rate and adjust for their next promo üòÇ,btohqsg
Any idea by what time must we move in the 100k today?,btohqsg
Why not now? Why want to be JIT warrior?,btohqsg
Hi just to clarify. So register today for 50k earmark  move in 100k today and another 50k on 30apr?,btohqsg
Will UoB ppv using FairPrice app earn 10x? Or have to use mobile contactless?,btohqsg

as xnap amounts can be rather small  ladys will be next best as the 9X miles doesn't have $5 blocks,btohqsg

I guess we can prepare for more nerfs to other banks too :(?I guess that's why they did rising dragon promo HAHHA,btohqsg

But evol need hit $600 sia,btohqsg
but 6.67%UOB one CC is 8.33% if spend ONLY on those cashback merchants,btohqsg

I hope all these nerf are April Fool‚Äôs joke from banks ü§£,btohqsg
IChange top up to tng suspended. Is this temporary or permanent?,btohqsg
looks like they cant agree on the fees...,btohqsg
They probably won't do anything. Majority of their customers probably won't even get above 3% p.a.,btohqsg
Could be April fools joke sia,btohqsg
Y'all day dreaming hard. Coping very hard ü§£,btohqsg
Not sure how ocbc will nerf their 360,btohqsg
Most bank interest now lower than 4% on 100k,btohqsg
is there some typo? what u mean by $50k in? Should get max interest in Apr for $100k MAB,btohqsg
They mean top up 50k for the new fresh funds promotion and make it to 150k instead,btohqsg
CORRECTand since your MAB is already $100k all along.. you CANNOT register for $150k earmark..the 'sweetspot' is topup to $150k (fresh $50k).. then register for $50k earmark.. and $150k earns the 4% p.a.,btohqsg
Lets wait for the other banks on their changes to the interest rate before deciding which other HISA accounts to go for. I wanted to set up UOB one for my wife. But now with this nerf  I will not proceed. But what I plan is to still top up to 150k and make my account joint name with my wife. It will still be useful as holding/emergency account.,btohqsg
guys don't worry it's just April Fools,btohqsg
Yeaa but no hurries to top up the fresh fund now. Since this month anything above 100k is still 0.05,btohqsg
note that this strategy will earn you APPROX 4.44% p.a. on $150k (4% p.a. interest on $150k + $250 cash credit for $50k earmark) and will lock you in for 4.5 months.Work it out yourself it you feel 4.4% p.a. for 4.5 months $150k lockin is worth or not. No right no wrong.,btohqsg
unless OCBC nerfs  360 with Salary (cannot hack  real salary) + save + card gives more than 4% for near 100k balances,btohqsg
If uob stash dont decrease rate then it us a better choice for earmark of 100k,btohqsg
based on 95K balance (to cater for save criteria's runway  so its not full 100K),btohqsg
The possibility it will be nerf. So lets wait and see.,btohqsg
we can only milk it while it lasts üò≠. earliest nerf is UOB since today is 1 Apr and they give 1 month notice per ABS guidelines,btohqsg
Also  we need to take note is that we will need to reset the OCBC account balance and for that  we will lose one month of interest. End of the day  the gains will not be that worth from my perspective. That why I staying put with OUB. But instead of 2 account of 100k  I will have 1 account of 150k.,btohqsg
the reset is taken into account  thus the 95K simulation instead of 100K from the get go  allowing us to have 10 months of $500 increment,btohqsg
I think I will put back my UOB $$ to Moomoo MMF.My total savings in UOB is just around 50K. I will use Amaze+citibank for daily expense  while UOB Lady's will be just for travel,btohqsg
#UOB#PlungingChickenOK I better say this (repeating to a few chats). So you can consider before locking in anything.There is ONE MORE OPTION you can consider.Totally empty your UOB One account BEFORE JUNE. And wait for the NEXT Plunging Chicken UOB promo which is likely to start in July 2024  based on June's MAB.So if your June's MAB is the minimum $1000  you can participate in the maximum $150k earmark in July Plunging Chicken promo with $151 0xx balance.,btohqsg
Maybe they add additional tiers to 150k for the 3% EIR ü§£,btohqsg
Ya. So don't top too early. Top up on 30 Apr..and rem to register for the saving promo,btohqsg
Let wait for more info first before register  i think not much ppl put in stash for promo which is why they did not change yet,btohqsg
have to work out the EIR for Stash...not sure if can win UOB one still or not..UOB One is 4.44% p.a. for $150k balance (inclusive of $50k new earmark). But this is not repeatable for the next earmark since now MAB approach.,btohqsg
Uob stash is ard 4.6 p.a for 100k so good for those who dont have 150k if current rate retain,btohqsg
this is assuming a brand new account signup and reference MAB is $0 right,btohqsg
Yes  it is a good choice to park money is the dont want to spend,btohqsg

"I have reached out to Endowus clarifying on dividend withholding taxes on Amundi Prime USA Fund and BlackRock iShares US Index fund and here is the response.""For the Amundi Prime USA Fund  as a UCITS unit trust fund  it is subject to a 30% DWT. These taxes are handled on the fund level which means that we do not incur any additional taxes as an investor in Singapore. We have an article that covers this topic in more detail here:https://endowus.com/insights/an-inconvenient-truth-tax-on-us-listed-etfs-04c7532c5dFor the BlackRock iShares US Index Fund  as it uses E-mini futures to replicate the S&P 500 index  it is thus not subject to any dividend-withholding tax  because there are no dividends to be had (the dividend 'value' is booked in the NAV). This means that the index fund using synthetic replication will benefit from an additional 15% of dividend values compared to UCITS ETFs  and an additional 30% when compared to UCITS unit trusts (like the Amundi fund) and US-domiciled ETFs.""",btohqsg

There's no Feb to Mar promo. Feb promo or Mar promo? Lol.,btohqsg
Yes  as discussed earlier. Likely due to low usage rate of GrabPay card also.,btohqsg
I guess grab wallets still works even it's card is discontinued,btohqsg
I registered on Feb  but the promo period is from feb to mar üòÇ So i dunno if i am considered registered for mar too?,btohqsg
Feb Promo:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/169064Mar Promo:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/177120I'm guessing you're referring to Feb Promo since you registered in Feb. Back to Apr Promo t&c  what does it say?,btohqsg
Only base interest will be paid if any withdrawals,btohqsg
But IRAS should still count according to the rumors.,btohqsg

Anyone notice the lady solitaire card on the website has a new look? I just received my card last week (old look)..I am new so i am not sure are there changes to this new card?,btohqsg
Look has changed and I think the higher mpd is if you have a lady's account or something as well,btohqsg
the old one looks nicer. anyway no longer 6mpd. they introduced a new bonus miles if u have a lady's saving account  but make no sense to me to lock up my money jus to earn some miles,btohqsg
Thats what they do with uob krisflyer iirc,btohqsg
can i ask for uob lady  the bonus UNI is based on overall category spend / $5 x 9 right ?,btohqsg
USD Fixed Deposit  interest is super high. 5.80% for 2 years. Is it advisable to invest?,btohqsg
If u have usd on hand. Sure. It‚Äôs goodIf u don‚Äôt have usd on hand. It means u have to sell sgd buy usd.This leaves u exposed to usd currency fluctuations. Can go up or down.,btohqsg
Yep. Have to convert. But SGD fixed deposits are atmost 3.5%. So losing 2.3% interest every month,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not sure this is the right way to view it.Unless u are based in USA and earning sgd then your view might be right.,btohqsg
Let me rephrase.African rand fixed deposits pay 9%pa.Singaporeans living in Singapore totally ignore that. Our fixed deposits pay 3.5%pa.Are we losing 5.5%pa interest by ignoring?,btohqsg
USDSGD is pretty stable. I have a lot in US t bills,btohqsg
This is a 5 year chart of usd/sgd. Pass your own judgement on whether this is stable enough for u to participate in a usd fixed deposit. There is no right no wrong since it‚Äôs an individual judgement call.,btohqsg
not USD fixed deposit but short dated t bills,btohqsg
Currently UOB One $100K every month get about $420. From May should be about $300 bah.,btohqsg

Calender days. But note the ‚Äústarts 7 days from policy delivery‚Äù,btohqsg
For big spend on mcc 5944 (jewelry) seems like dbs altitude is still the best right?,btohqsg
Otherwise  I think can split up payment as below1. HSBC Revo - $1k2. Citi Rewards - $1k3. DBS Altitude - $3k (for new to card promo 60k miles)4. UOB krisflyer - remaining?,btohqsg
Do you need to amaze the Citi rewards card?Perhaps search chat history ‚Äú5944‚Äù will give you some clues.,btohqsg
Dbs vantage (new signup) 85k miles,btohqsg
Hello all  does anyone knows duty free shopping considered as Travel or Shopping?,btohqsg
why udw just clock all with UOB KF? isnt it easier with 3mpd uncapped?,btohqsg
Travel if u are using UOB Ladys,btohqsg
Duty free is travel for lady,btohqsg
According to Heymax I dont need to pair with Amaze. For citi is not under blacklist and for Hsbc is under contactless.,btohqsg
4mpd lor hahaha and max rewards?,btohqsg
provided the shop allows split payments,btohqsg
Only for uob lady? Cause I checked heymax. It recommended CRMC. So I am a bit confused  as uob lady travel have to be selected category but CRMC doesn't include travel.,btohqsg
True haha I need to ask Jannpaul this weekend,btohqsg
have u checked ur settings on which cards the app show u first?,btohqsg
Heymax indicate 4mpd for CRMC if online right? If buy from physical shop need Amaze to convert to online,btohqsg
5309 duty free is not considered travel for CRMC but it falls under UOB lady‚Äôs definition of travel.,btohqsg
I am afraid you need to amaze it. Heymax unlikely will include amaze in their recommendations if you paywave at the merchant.,btohqsg
My setting is best card to use with cards that I own.,btohqsg
Please watch this video to find the best card to usehttps://youtu.be/SZjUC2euNdo,btohqsg
Ahhh great luckily I asked. Thanks fam. I think need Amaze just to be safe.,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check if there are other ways to use uob absolute card for public transport since grab pay will discontinue their card,btohqsg
UOB One interest for March is in$420+ for bonus interest posted today 2/4$4+ for base interest posted 31/3,btohqsg
Hi guys  is it possible to use credit card to deposit in webull rather than using debit card ?,btohqsg
Y would u use UOB absolute card for public transport? There are better cards out there giving higher cash rebates for public transport,btohqsg
This is confusing. First you say UOB Absolute card then you say GrabPay card... Both also no link üòÖ,btohqsg
Think he is using grabpay as a proxy for non AMEX accepted merchants,btohqsg
Welp it's confirmed:https://www.hsbc.com.sg/content/dam/hsbc/sg/documents/accounts/everyday-global/everyday+rewards-programme-tcs.pdf- Credit cards have been removed from HSBC Everyday+ Bonus programs. Only debit card spendings earn 1% Everyday+ cashback.- Payments made to financial institutions also excluded,btohqsg
ok to be clear (and cover my S)  Insurance companies are definitely FIs. But whether will be filtered out by HSBC is to be tested.,btohqsg
My $80k with moomoo Fullerton cash fund has stopped crediting daily returns since 29Mar (31jan-29mar). But I have only gotten $541.30  which is about 4% instead of 5.8%. Anyone experience this before and how did you go about getting the rest of the interest?,btohqsg

Can I check  ocbc hardly waive credit card late charges ?,btohqsg
Your 60 days ended 28 Mar?,btohqsg
gonna terminate my Advance card and switching to DCS Ultimate,btohqsg
Just a side note  DCS cards cant be added to any mobile wallet (i.e. gpay  applepay  samsungpay),btohqsg
Insurance companies are considered financial institutions? Means if ega will not get 1% cashback for paying insurance via giro?,btohqsg
GIRO for CC payments no more cashback? ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
So use hsbc acct to giro pay dbs credit card wont get 1%cashback ü•≤,btohqsg
Hahahaha if bank not financial institutions then what are they doing?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs a major nerf for meüåöI don‚Äôt even know how to pay cc bill now,btohqsg
So now there's really not much reason to use the revolution card anymore,btohqsg
Consolidate all on DBS CC and then pay one shot without rewards ü§£,btohqsg
You must understand  I just setup GIRO to start this month payment,btohqsg
maybe just exclude those trading platform?,btohqsg
I think so too. Since bank cc is like ega biggest usage,btohqsg
If exclude cc bill payment they could have stated as such instead of using terms like financial institutions,btohqsg
isn't it broader to cover FI.. that's EVERYTHING..,btohqsg
which is exactly how they are bleeding $500 per customer,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtI think insurance still üëåüèª. Their debit card 1% cashback split insurance from financial institutions very clearly.,btohqsg
i hope so too... i guess anyone proven wrong is a 'happy problem'..but definition of FI.. honestly.. covers banks and insurance companies  and some say finance companies.,btohqsg
anyway  need to test to know for sure,btohqsg
yeah i guess no harm since most of us will be lazy to change our current GIRO arrangement and no other alternative anyway,btohqsg
Hello anyone can advise like anyways to pay ccard without,btohqsg
Pull out the publicly available t&c for the promo till Jul 24.,btohqsg
By paying in full before the due date.,btohqsg
Cuz I have like 8 k to pay but u see I pay 1 k evey month also still got interest incurred,btohqsg
Don't have the 8 k one shot,btohqsg
Then you need to review your spending. And try to return 2k instead of 1k. Clearly you're not a CC person.,btohqsg
So like any ways like can brake the loan amount in to 8.months or 6 months,btohqsg
See if other bank got balance transfer promo,btohqsg
As stated by@qqplaces  check for balance transfer promos  pay it off  and maybe avoid using CC for now.,btohqsg
I no longer use the ccard,btohqsg
How dose this balance transfer works,btohqsg
Use a debit card  make sure you budget your spending. Repaying the loan comes first. It is a legit  if you need to eat grass  then eat grass scenario.,btohqsg
U need to apply another bank cc to balance transfer over  sometime bank run promo like 0 percent balance transfer for like 6 month. Althernative  get a personal loan at lower interest rate to pay off cc interestNot wise to pay cc interest as it range from 24-25 percent p.a while personal loan is less then 10,btohqsg
The a go go days of high interest rates are coming to an end  banks‚Äô profitability protected. Enjoy the last bits while we can üòÖ,btohqsg
Hsbc usage most prob will drop alot after this nerf haha  card not that competitive also liao,btohqsg
Does it mean that previously and until end of this month  giro to brokerages or robo invest will work?,btohqsg
very sad  everything nerfed including my salary üò≠,btohqsg
I had been missing out so much...,btohqsg
For ocbc 360 account  how do i get the monthly avg balance to increase to get the saving interest while maintaining max 100k at the account?Is reducing the amount in the account for the whole of the 3rd month the only way?,btohqsg
best that you are able to pay it up asap   CC interest rate is 26-30%,btohqsg
Just curious. If I max out SSB  can I sell the lower interest ones this month and apply this month too?,btohqsg
Is there any credit card we can use to pay for our NUS school fees?,btohqsg
"Basically you pay off your cc via another bank at a lower fee/rates compared to your CC interest rates. Google ""balance transfer promo""  there's a lot of options available  pick the one that has the lowest fee for your situation.",btohqsg
"at clause (ii)  they could have simply say ""GIRO bill payments to any Credit Card"" to avoid ambiguity  instead of just HSBC Credit card if they want to exclude credit card payment.Anyway nothing much we can do  just wait to find out",btohqsg
That's why they cannot change their interest rates yet. The earliest their nerf start will be Jun.,btohqsg
i can consider opening in may  since UOB one until may then will drop to 3%,btohqsg
You can always start with 95k for 10 months to max of 100k,btohqsg
Maybe OCBC drop even lower in Jun?,btohqsg
This one we don't know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
Only 0.3% cashback but still better than nothing.,btohqsg
but ocbc credit cards like not much benefits   compared to evol that i have been using,btohqsg
