Better you call in to the bank to check,btohqsg
should I go for the uob one savings account or ocbc 360 savings account? I just graduated and started working and am thinking of which savings account to get.Initially was thinking of getting the uob lady‚Äôs credit card for 6mpd with the uob one saving account but I‚Äôm not sure if I can hit uob one‚Äôs 500$ min spend requirement by using the uob lady‚Äôs card alone (since we can only get miles for one category)Or should I get the ocbc 360 instead?,btohqsg
Hey yall so anyone here knows how to transfer money from posb to Paypal?? Please anyone,btohqsg

Which ocbc card is the best?,btohqsg
I have both account and will be using back OCBC 360. For my case is UOB didn‚Äôt approve credit cards for me and I don‚Äôt want to stress myself on spending the $500 every month just to get the interest.,btohqsg

Hi all  wanted to check. I‚Äôm planning to open an SRS account and aware that I can do so via 3banks(DBS UOB OCBC). Just wondering if there any pros/cons between them? And any recommendation to go with?,btohqsg

What about Citi rewards pay Singtel bill via app or citi rewards link to amaze pay with Singtel app for bill will earn points on either method? ',btohqsg
Check your card security settings. Did you block online transactions or things like that?,btohqsg
Depends on your preference/convenience and your future business with the bank  but generally not much difference between them. SRS has no FD facility with all the banks so far  correct me if I‚Äôm wrong,btohqsg
There is a timetable for the National saving promo. Wait ah I find the table again,btohqsg
I am actually not new or consider new.. cos I don‚Äôt have 100K in my account but going to deposit it on 1st Sept,btohqsg
Yup thanks for sharing.. I saw this one too so my cashback benefit should be 31st Oct,btohqsg
This promo is for all customers.The key is what is your day end balance for all your uob accounts as at 30th June 2023.Yes it looks at all your account balances. Not just the participating one.,btohqsg
Is there any new user sign up promotion for Instarem Amaze right now?,btohqsg
After deposit then spend 500 monthly to uob one card,btohqsg
When do they usually credit the interest?,btohqsg
For example of all your uob accounts add up to $5 123 on 30th June 2023. Out of which $1000 is in uob ONE account.U want to earmark $100 000.U need to keep $101 000 in your uob ONE account throughout the promo. And your total uob balance throughout promo must be $105 123 and above.,btohqsg
For the $558  on the same day as the earmark happening.,btohqsg
Wow cant take out the interest Ah?,btohqsg
Because new sign ups were closed for almost a month now. And the interest rate is shite anyway,btohqsg
2.68% no frills is still quite good.,btohqsg
Can but only the interest. The rest of the money you take out as long as you put in back the same or more amount on the same day ü§£Jokes aside you can take out as much after the earmarked date.,btohqsg
New to CIMB gets 3.5% no frills ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
The 100k only can touch after 15 Jan 2024 to keep the cash credit,btohqsg
that's better I agree but i think there are some conditions though easy to fulfill.,btohqsg
Would SSB interest payout be considered as qualifying transaction for this CDP dividend promo?,btohqsg
Nope. Just deposit 1k to savings or 5k to current. No frills.,btohqsg
IMPORTANT NOTES:1. Open a CIMB Savings Account online by 30 Sep '23 with at least S$1 000 for savings and S$5 000 for current account.2. Maintain or increase your current month's end balance against the previous month's end balance.,btohqsg
Yup that's all  kinda no frills don't you think?,btohqsg
yes hence why I said easy to fulfill. point is if you can fulfill  then just get the one that gives the better rate.,btohqsg
I think there is fix deposit for SRS with different rate for different bank(DBS UOB),btohqsg
Means every month - also need to put some $$  to maintain the 3.5% interesr....( Must right?)?,btohqsg
You can don't money in. Just make sure net amount doesn't decrease.,btohqsg
No money in also get 3.5%,btohqsg
But need put 12 Months? How many months r u putting alf?üòä,btohqsg
Don't need 12 months. I think this is good for those just want to set aside and park their idle cash and earn a good rate. I'm not using this.,btohqsg

can i get 1% cashback from hsbc ega for insurance payments?,btohqsg
It is stated in the DBS altitude website which airlines are included. The list of airlines are updated(added or removed) by DBS from time to time. When you booked your tickets  store a copy of TnC n keep it for future missing rewards claims  if need.In summary  the list of airlines is not fixed permanently. It depends on when you book.,btohqsg
For the rest of answers  you can search chat history using keyword ‚Äúcard air ticket‚Äù. There many people provided very useful answers on this.Good luck n enjoy your holiday.üòÄ,btohqsg

Go with amaze as primary and you trip / revolut as a backup.,btohqsg
Amaze wins youtrip / revolut for all transactions that earns credit card rewards. Yet amaze is not 100% reliable and can get declined.,btohqsg
Yea. Looking for something reliable though. Hmmm. What‚Äôs after Amaze?,btohqsg
Interestingly  there isn't any other card like Amaze for now.. it's unique.Maybe next time when Heymax comes  it will be king  if/when it comes.,btohqsg

Wah this is like even more powerful than amaze,btohqsg
to be clear  it is UOB One's 30th June day end balanceAS WELL ASTOTAL OF ALL UOB ACCOUNTS 30th June day end balance.,btohqsg
sorry i don‚Äôt understand why *0.05?,btohqsg
If you have $100k in uob one  your EIR interest rate is 5% which is 5%/100% = 0.05,btohqsg
ic. so for those that already have 100k on 30 june will  only be 0.05%,btohqsg
Has anyone tried to withdraw RM from the Johor ATM using the trust debit card? Going JB soon  want to know if it works üôÇ,btohqsg
5% in decimal form is 0.05  don't confuse yourself100 * 0.05 = 5100 * 5% = 5just different ways to say same thing,btohqsg
Sound be 5%  not 0.05%. It you want to enjoy NDP promo  topup another $100k to enjoy the promo. Mean you have $200k with UOB.,btohqsg
So to say they only look at June only?July and August. They ingore?,btohqsg
5% for the first 100k  0.05% for the next 100k  right?,btohqsg
Can I check what is the best credit card for a $5 000 spend (one time spend for wedding photoshoot)?,btohqsg
Uob doesn‚Äôt work on moving incremental balance basis. Yet.,btohqsg
Probably get a mix ofUob vs $2kUob ppv $1kAmaze crmc $1kI‚Äôm sure your wedding shop can accept 2 periods of payment. Deposit and final payment. Split over 2 cycles.,btohqsg
I wanted to reply what Mt said - UOB VS  best if can split. Maybe 2 * UOB VS + 1 * UOB PPV.But also wah what wedding photoshoot costs $5000 sia mine costs $1000 or less.. a lot of add ons and gown rental is it,btohqsg
Yes gown rental and other add ons,btohqsg
Basic one is already $2k and I just randomly chose one from internet. Branded one would be more expensive. Then most also include wedding car + wedding day photos / videos. $5k might not even be enough.,btohqsg
It works. Withdrew from CIMB atm. No atm fees also,btohqsg
for shopback's next visit to the merchant in order to receive prev cashback.. can I just make another 1 cent / 10 cents payment to receive it?,btohqsg
Yes. I don‚Äôt think anyone in this group interested on 0.05% of interest per year.Ie. $50 per year(0.05%) vs $5000 per year (5%) for $100k of saving.,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúBest Card wedding‚Äù to search chat history to see what other reply.,btohqsg

Can I ask.. miles transfer to krisflyer normally between $26~$27.. is it worth it?,btohqsg
I see uob or Amex krisflyer is directly don‚Äôt need transfer but the miles earned is lesser üòÇ,btohqsg
Ok jokes aside:1. Uob if u get the visa infinites  the pooled miles can be moved without paying transfer fee2. Citibank ultima also has transfer fee waiver but no miles poolingWorth it if u are able to extract value from those cards benefits vs the annual fee payable. Some say uob visa infinite fee might be Waivable especially the old plastic version.Disclaimer: I have none. All just hearsay.,btohqsg
Pool miles.. you mean get at least 2 of UOB miles card  then if let‚Äôs say visa infinite don‚Äôt need transfer fees and uob lady need transfer fees  I just transfer miles from uob lady to uob visa infinite?,btohqsg
ultima is $4 200 annual fee? transfer miles is $25 each time?,btohqsg
3.65% is guaranteed.. another 0.27% non-guaranteed,btohqsg
But I can‚Äôt apply for uob infinite as income not met üòÖ,btohqsg
Pooled means all in one uob container. U transfer using uob infinite will take from that one container.No need transfer anything,btohqsg

One thing needs to remind that miles earned from HSBC revo does not necessarily have shorter expiry date than Citi rewards. Miles from Citi rewards can have expiry date as short as 3 months only because Citi rewards use fixed expiry date.,btohqsg
Is it a good to Use cpf OA to invest in the upcoming t bill ?,btohqsg
I see  then how would the HSBC Revo compare to Citi PremierMiles as a secondary card? Would it be more beneficial to have the miles that dont expire instead?,btohqsg
Do anyone know what are the eligible plan?,btohqsg
How does the expiry for miles work exactly? Like i earned 120000 points at the end of first year  converted them to miles that means the miles have only 2 years of expiry? In case for hsbc and 4 years in case of citi?,btohqsg
You need to estimate how much is your expenses in next 2-5 years n what are those expenses( can earn miles?)  then calculate are you able to redeem your dream ticket before the miles expired.There is no one shoe can fit everybody foot. You need to understand your expenses  pattern  then strategise your card usage.,btohqsg
anyone knows how soon amaze card will credit the insta points after making the transaction?,btohqsg
I only got the one on pepper lunch then the two transactions after that i realized nothing was credited yetAlso i did not use amaze walletAny idea why?,btohqsg
Citi rewards: expiry date is based on card approval date which is fixed date. Eg. 5 years from card approval date. Hence  all your points will expire on the same day regardless when you earn it.HSBC revo: 37 months from the date you earned the points. Hence  your point will expire in batches.,btohqsg
only earn instapoints if at least SGD 10,btohqsg

hi! any masters using uob one cc can help me pls. if i have $50 for acb with mrt/bus  am i eligible for 3.33% + 5%(acb) OR 5% ? also  for first tier of cashback if i spent 800 first month  and 500 following both month  do i get cashback for the additional 300 spent on first month?,btohqsg
Hello  earlier in the year there was a HSBC EGA + revo promotion where we could get 300 + 350 for the account and card. Could I check if anyone got this cashback  HSBC keeps saying that because I got credit card sign up bonus I‚Äôm not entitled to EGA welcome offer anymore.. and their customer service is absolutely trash,btohqsg
Common. British owned bank is mostly very arrogant one. Still tot they are the empire on which the sun never sets,btohqsg
Actually HSBC customer service is thrashy because they chopped and reduced a lot of their agents.,btohqsg
if you met tiered spending for all 3 statement months of quarter  u get tiered quarterly rebate AND additional cashback for specific merchants e.g. 5% for mrt/bus,btohqsg
yup  so will my mrt/bus spending gain 8.33% or 5% cashback?,btohqsg
quarterly rebate+5%. Based on your spending so far  you can get at most $50 quarterly rebate effective less than 3.33%.,btohqsg
I received both through SingSaver. Though I had to call the bank and appeal that I fulfilled all criteria for HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
If the miles/points are still with credit card bank account  the expiry date of miles/points follows bank TnC.Once you convert the miles/points and credits into airline partners‚Äô account  the miles will follow airlines TnC which has separate life span from the date the miles credited into the airline account.,btohqsg

so could you technically wait for when your point are expiring and convert it all to miles to the airline partners then does it kinda extends the expiry?,btohqsg
Yes if you can do it before points expiring. Just don‚Äôt walk alone the edge of cliff  give some safety distance.,btohqsg

just sharing ¬† I kena a fraudulent transaction from UK  lucky is GBP14.99 via my DBS cc. It happened on Sunday and I just saw it 20 mins ago and reported. Do check your account regularly.,btohqsg
How do you get to this smartpark page?,btohqsg
Must check every single transaction on your credit card bill. I had 7 consecutive fraudulent transactions totalling about sgd80++. In the end bank refunded.You need to report to bank on this cc fraud and they will refund.,btohqsg
U have to click the mywealth banner  it should be one swipe away  at the page with banners,btohqsg
Ok. Got it. Need to wait for 1-2 days for the fund to auto transfer to MMF  right?,btohqsg
I have a debit card fraudulent transaction amting to sgd400+. I discovered it the other day. Already reported to the bank. They said might take months for the outcome via investigation.Can anyone tell me whether that is true.,btohqsg
sgd 400. so its on charge dispute..,btohqsg
Never took mths for me  its usually days,btohqsg
What am I supposed to do now ? Is it cos its of a higher amount ?,btohqsg
cant do anything   last year my posb everyday card was fraud abt SGD 200,btohqsg
They said 7 to 14 days to monitor. And up to 45 to 90 days to investigate. But it is unfair as I did not receive any otp etc. i dun even use my debit card,btohqsg
Mine is even better  i locked my card entirely viaDBSapp and it still got a fraud charge. ü§£,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt even use my own card and they managed to charge it. üòÇ They are Pretty good man,btohqsg
I concur  would recommend check on daily basis  which is what I do  only takes 5 mins of my time. Happened to me before  i reported within the same day and it was refunded to me within 1 week. Fastest was Citibank which took 2 days to refund.,btohqsg
Just called uob. The monies will be temporary refunded to the bank acct within 30days from the day one made the report to the bank. The investigation team will take 45 to 90 days for them to find evidence whether it is indeed an authorised trans. And will take the monies back if the bank found out it is actually legit.,btohqsg
Yes I agreed. I didn‚Äôt even use the debit card online  only the atm function. Does not make sense to me,btohqsg
UOB informed 30 calendar days.. I would think the rest are the same. But that's for credit cards.,btohqsg
It's charges from MIDJOURNEY  INC. right? Unfortunately is a brute force attack. And also the reason why you should avoid using debit cards. Once the money is out  it's out.,btohqsg
Just sign up  have not gotten the card,btohqsg
And I don‚Äôt even use the debit function anywhere.,btohqsg
Would probably be the same method unfortunately. As long as you put alerts then you should be able to catch it quick enough.Anyway if you have (other) credit cards from UOB  you should probably use them for ATM and cancel the debit card... else you'll end up paying the annual fee for the debit card too.,btohqsg
Yes I have blocked the card and got a new card which is a sole atm card.,btohqsg
Just remember all the credit or debit cards set the alert for every transaction then won't get shock,btohqsg
okay  will spend next month then,btohqsg

Are you giving out for free?,btohqsg
How to avoid using when the card is tied to your bank account? People can still brute force and guess the number,btohqsg
Based on chat history  I'm assuming you're new to credit cards.Debit card takes the money out of your bank directly while credit card works in a way like a loan  where you spend first and pay later. So it's easier for the bank to reverse the transaction after investigation.On top of that  getting many credit cards DO NOT hurt your credit score. Not paying in full will.,btohqsg
There is one exception to your last paragraph.If you apply for too many credit cards in a short period of time (eg 3 different banks within 1 month)  it will definitely hurt your credit score as you will be deemed a desperate borrower by the Credit Bureau system.,btohqsg
Haha best is to only apply for one credit card per year and the rest of the year just pay in full your credit cards. Confirmed you will get AA rating in two years .,btohqsg
Unlikely to hurt credit score but likely to be rejected on the 2nd or 3rd card. Recently was rejected by Maybank and thanks to the consolation prize  can confirm that it didn't hurt my credit score.Unless someone else recently got rejected too to say otherwise haha.,btohqsg
üëãüèª anyone recently signed up for Youtrip? How long did you guys wait for the card?,btohqsg

i have a human that all along is BB... applied for multiple UOB cards  then 2 Citibank cards. Dropped to EE. All cards approved.,btohqsg
Rip. But that's a shitload of cards though. And not sure starting at BB is a concern.. I only got -1 score from a recent late payment of CC cuz I forgot ü§°,btohqsg
Anyone know how the minimum repayment for CC works? Apprently only need to pay 50$ then the rest can pay ltr?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs only to avoid late payment fees. You will still have to pay in full in order to avoid the interest on remaining balance.,btohqsg
this game quite dangerous  minimally pay a bit more than the min payment,btohqsg
If you willing to pay the high interest rate and hurt your credit score then sure...,btohqsg
i thnk as long as got hit minimum payment  wont hurt score.dont pay min. then will affect score,btohqsg
Pay minimum will hurt your wallet heavily.,btohqsg
But it will affect the rate of score gained.,btohqsg
yes thisthe interest is damn painful,btohqsg
Honestly if you can't pay full you shouldn't even use CC,btohqsg
Which channel is best to report? Via phone or online chat? Dbs don't have online chat though,btohqsg
Or set your limit to literally 1k lol,btohqsg
New DBS customer? DBS has online chat for years. Aka digibot ü§™And their first stop for fraud reporting IS online chat.,btohqsg
that is typically what i do.....set to a really low credit limiteven if im unable to pay off in 1 month  i can definitely finish it in the next 1-2 months,btohqsg
If you not able to pay off in 1 month means your limit is not low enough..,btohqsg
If I use uob lady‚Äôs cc to pay bills on health buddy  will this constitute part of the $500 min credit card spend for UOB one account?,btohqsg
I know how CC works but not using debit card doesn‚Äôt mean your debit card won‚Äôt get hack. They can still brute force and generate a number that could belong to you. But that‚Äôs a very low chance of it happening,btohqsg
If you re-read the message  avoid using debit card is not to prevent brute force fraud transactions. It's so that the money does not leave your bank account directly.,btohqsg

Poems mobile 2.0 or poems mobile 3,btohqsg
So it doesn‚Äôt matter which app?,btohqsg
I believe number of enquiries to credit score (which will increase when you apply) also affects the score. Coz then like you said it's deemed that you're desperate that you're applying to so many,btohqsg
If you are after 10% cashback for Simplygo  why not consider UOB One at 10% cashback for Simplygo ALL THE TIME!,btohqsg
Good point  but I will be using CRMC for the bulk of my spending and wouldn't be hitting UOB One min. $500. Moreover  Paylah has the stamp cards for topping up ezlink $20*3 for $3 rebate,btohqsg
That's effectively 15% cashback for the first $60,btohqsg

Use Amaze and pay in USD  make sure you link a SG credit card with high rewards,btohqsg

if the item you're buying allows payment in SGD you might want to use SGD directly. Amazon DCC rates are usually pretty goodYou can doublecheck the rate by swapping between currencies.,btohqsg

also anyone has recommendations on what personal accident and critical illness insurance to get?,btohqsg
Means to say up the 50% of the monthly spend of the calendar month can be made up of insurance only?,btohqsg
It means your insurance spending can only make up to 50% of eligible spending...$300 - insurance up to $150$1000 - insurance up to $500$2000 - insurance up to $1000,btohqsg
If i exceed then how. Example i clock $300 in total  of which $200 is insurance. So $50  will not count toward the $300 and cashback calculation or what will happen,btohqsg
For those who still cannot visualise..Example 1: $200 Insurance  $100 Other Eligible Spend (Total Spend: $300)Actual Eligible Spend: $150 + $100 = $250Result: Not eligible for cashbackExample 2: $500 Insurance  $400 Other Eligible Spend (Total Spend: $900)Actual Eligible Spend: $150 + $400 = $550Result: Eligible for $30 cashbackExample 3: $2000 Insurance  $500 Other Eligible Spend (Total Spend: $2500)Actual Eligible Spend: $500 + $500 = $1000Result: Eligible for $100 cashbackExample 4: $100 Insurance  $1900 Other Eligible Spend (Total Spend $2000)Actual Eligible Spend: $100 + $1900 = $2000Result: Eligible for $200 cashbackAnyone nice want to help to turn this into table format for easy viewing can do so üôÇ,btohqsg

Chill I typing out for y'all. Confirm know got such qn haha,btohqsg
Paypal* merchant name. So if your merchant not on exclusion list  it is eligble,btohqsg
Example 2 will qualify for tier 2 isnt it?,btohqsg
Oops I meant to put 400,btohqsg
Basically what this mean is that if u want to clock 1 k insurance u need match 1k of other eligble spending.Abit like their fd where u need to park how much in normal saving in order to get to park in their high fd,btohqsg
It is similar but better then uob for non bonus spending as half can make up by insurance,btohqsg

Do I apply for credit card first or bank account first if I don‚Äôt want to have to go down physically?,btohqsg

To withdraw from Moomoo cashplus  we have to wait T+2 trading days in order to withdraw am i correct..,btohqsg
Seems counter intuitive to have both cards together... lolWhy not split your spending between Maybank Platinum Visa + UOB EVOL? Assuming you have a UOB card to clock the spending for UOB One Account.Maybank Platinum Visa: 1k insurance + 500 other eligible spending for tier 2 (assuming you able to do it for 3 months straight)UOB EVOL: 250 online/250 mobile contactless/100 other eligible spending (to hit minimum spend)Quarterly you get 100 + 120 = 220 cashbackYearly you get 220 x 4 = 880 cashbackTotal spending is 1500 + 600 = 2100 per month (which is within your assumption of 2500 spending),btohqsg
Sorry  I have no knowledge on this as I m not interested on 3.33% using insurance.,btohqsg
Thanks melvyn  I was thinking to allocate first to evol card with 600  second to maybank platinum card hit tier 2 with 500 (excluding my insurance) and anything more all in my uob one card. I'm just dilemma whether should try to hit tier 3 of Maybank card,btohqsg
If you spend 1600 of eligible spending then sure.. that's 500 more per month compared to what I calculated above.Which leads to 320/qtr and 1280/yr in terms of cashback.But you have to know you're spending 1500 more quarterly just to get 100 more cashback.,btohqsg
Normally for me and my family  we do have big spending as 2 kids. Previously I can just park my insurance spending at mb and focus on evol and uob1 cards but now mb revised. That's why I have to rethink and reallocate to get the best cashback. Sigh.,btohqsg
Honestly  if you spend 1600 monthly and some of the spending are eligible for the additional bonus cashback for UOB One Card  might as well ignore the 3.33% from Maybank Platinum Card lol.UOB One with 1000 spending that includes the eligible spending for bonus additional cashback (up to 50 monthly)  you'll get 250/qtyUOB EVOL with the remaining 600 spending  you'll get 120/qtyTotal cashback per quarter: 250 + 120 = 370Yearly that would be 1480. Which is 200 more than using Maybank Platinum Card.But ya  Maybank screwed over those who try to get cashback from insurance. Which is honestly sooner or later kinda thing.,btohqsg
I guess its because insurance are not eligible for the uob cards I have.,btohqsg
I having second thoughts of getting Maybank card but even with the nerf  I think it'll might still give me more than what I have rn as I don't have a high amount of other spending.The lowest tier of 150+150 to get 30/qtr seems fine for my use case... I don't really think I can even hit 500 other eligible spending for tier 2. ü§™,btohqsg
Not financial advice... just doing quick maffs üåö 2+2 is 4,btohqsg
I can't thank enough üòå I'm having headache after this revise.. sigh,btohqsg
Anyways  back to the original calculation of 1100 other eligible spending that was originally used to get tier 2 for Maybank Platinum Card...If you can get UOB One bonus additional cashback within the 500 (tier 1)  you'll also get 25/qtr more cashback per month compared to Maybank Platinum Visa.Which is 100/yr more cashback from UOB One and adding UOB EVOL  you'll get 980/yr total cashback instead of 880/yr with Maybank Platinum Visa.But.... if you really cannot even get 1 cent of the UOB One additional cashback (which is VERY difficult  considering that Shopee  Dairy Farm Merchants  Grab  SimplyGo  SP and Petrol are quite commonly visited for most people with family)  then you can use your insurance spending with Maybank Platinum Card ü§£,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I would like to apply for Citi Rewards MC for an upcoming holiday trip day expenses. The singsaver signup promo of $300 PayNow seems more attractive than the 16000 miles from Citi themselves.https://www.singsaver.com.sg/credit-card/best-dealsHowever I see that on the Singsaver signup it says 3 Sept 2023. May I check the following?1. Does it mean I will be eligible if I sign up with singsaver on 3 September + hit min spend OR does 3 September refer to the time Singsaver reach out to Citi for approval  which may take some working days?2. From the time I submit the form on singsaver  around how long will it take to receive the credit card to start spending?3. Any stories where the 30 days start counting since card approval but the card didn‚Äôt arrive until near the end of the 30 days?,btohqsg
So you mean as below?Evol - 600Maybank tier 2 - 500 (to total 1k)Uob1 - tier 1 - 500Total 1 100 spending.,btohqsg
No.. like I said  it's counter intuitive to use both. UOB EVOL is a must to clock 600  the rest either UOB One or Maybank Platinum Visa. Tier 2 and tier 3 of Maybank Platinum Visa is trash compared to UOB One equivalent tiers (after the nerf).Only use Maybank Platinum Visa if you don't spend a single cent on any of the following:1. Shopee2. Grab3. Dairy Farm Merchants (e.g. Giant  Guardian  7-11  etc)4. SimplyGo (i.e. Bus and Train)5. Singapore Power6. Petrol at Shell or SPCORIf you have extra spending of 150 to get their tier 1 cashback of 30/qtr. ü§£So basically:1. UOB EVOL - 6002. UOB One - 500/1000/20003. Maybank Platinum Visa - 150 (and 150 insurance),btohqsg
Really wrong move for Maybank to nerf their card that hard. Then again  it feels like they were giving out free cashback to those already paying for insurance lolol,btohqsg
Whats best card for purchases like a few k,btohqsg
You can start by checking out Chris' videos on YouTube. You might want to look at UOB One Card if you can hit 2k of eligible spending every month.,btohqsg

Is it right that CIMB savings account is only looking at only month end date balances? Eg: 31 Aug vs 30 Sept. in the middle you can just shift in and out of the funds?,btohqsg
My interpretation is if you arenew to CIMB customer:1. Your interest will consist of two parts: base andbonusinterest2). The interest (both base and bonus) you earned are calculated based on daily balance in your account.3). Whether you can eventually get thebonusinterest is depends on your this month end balance compare against previous month end balance.,btohqsg
Hi does this means i get 3% cash back?,btohqsg
Makes more sense in this manner- being a two tier criteria rather than just looking at the month end balances. Seems like your balance could go up/down Intra month but just make sure its more than the previous month end date on the last day of the current month.Some hints dropped in tnc that the bonus interest accrues *daily*.,btohqsg
Provided you meet the minimum spend requirements and did not exceed maximum cashback requirements.,btohqsg
