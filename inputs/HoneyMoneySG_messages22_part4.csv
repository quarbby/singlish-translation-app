tomorrow around 1+pm if there are no delays,btohqsg
Does anyone know if citi cashback+ card can earn cashback from topping up shopee pay  grab pay?,btohqsg
im wondering if i use uob absolute card with favepay and shopback directly  will i get cashback?,btohqsg
of cos can but there are many better cards for this,btohqsg
you mean other credit card counts this as online shopping?,btohqsg
noted  many thanks! so dbs includes shopback? i think it's so great.,btohqsg
Does anyhow topup liquid cash wallet using credit card   can it be used for paynow qr merchant?,btohqsg
should only use credit card linked to liquidpay directly (dun topup) to get card benefits. Can only use liquidpay at SGQR with liquidpay logo.,btohqsg
Those who used sc smart card for public transportation  how long does it take for ur transaction to be recorded? I dont get any transaction alert unlike amex which is instantaneous,btohqsg
Quite slow. Did not go check. But the points took really long. They only give me half the points of my November spends. Say other points will be given after this month statement.,btohqsg
Mine tracks the amount the next day  but takes a few days for it to get posted! Not sure about the points though  i just started using the card too haha,btohqsg
i think scb smart card is kinda nerfðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
prompt user to eat fast food  no lah.,btohqsg
No minimum spend. Just don't eat lor,btohqsg
But you can topup to GrabPay and then use GrabPay on Shopback  while it lasts,btohqsg
currently i am using this method. but after uob cancel grabpay topup cashback  i want to find another way to use favepay and shopback.,btohqsg
UOB Evol is one of the best cards for FavePay/Shopback now I think,btohqsg
If I use UOB Evol with Favepay/Shopback to pay for food/drinks  is it considered as an online spend?,btohqsg
Ya sort off in a way,btohqsg
Yup. You can also use UOB Evol with Kris+ and it will count as mobile contactless spend,btohqsg
Can. I got 2 citibank credit cards. Both annual fees are waived.,btohqsg
Maybe Citi rewards with amaze card or HSBC revolution (2.6% Cashback with no minimum spend). Or maybe Citi SMRT card (but this one min spend is $500),btohqsg
Oh EVOL with Kris+ is mobile contactless?? Not online?,btohqsg
Yes  for some odd reason Kris+ transactions through Google Pay count as mobile contactless.,btohqsg
This is also the same reason why iPhone users can't earn 4mpd on citi rewards through Kris+,btohqsg
Anybody use citi pay all service?,btohqsg
Did not see anyone talking about it  so I suppose not worth to explore?,btohqsg
Once awhile they will have some random promotion which you can get good rates.Thatâ€™s when ppl will use it,btohqsg
means promo of less than 2% charge  right?,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s incorrect  I have 3 dbs cards for years and never pay af,btohqsg
Sometimes hard to say because of insurance or travel,btohqsg
If not wrong need spend min 12k/year,btohqsg
1k a month it's a little hard,btohqsg
i can barely meet the 600 min spend of live fresh,btohqsg
Some people with family will always cross 1k  but itâ€™s yearly  not monthly 1k  so may spend more in months,btohqsg
But  I have close all ocbc cc because of that requirements  even Iâ€™m priority cust,btohqsg
If u Solo will be harder those with family will be easier to reach 1k,btohqsg
Does anyone know if citi cashback + includes cashback for insurance?,btohqsg
Morning all  can I check if both citi rewards and DBS WWMCâ€™s statement are both by calendar month? i.e: 1st January Reset?,btohqsg
I donâ€™t have that card  but my impression that all card exclude insurance  except Amex or Uob absolute,btohqsg
Anyone tried using citi cashback + for health checkup at raffles medical? Any cashback?,btohqsg
citi rewards by statement  posted datedbs wwmc by calendar month  transaction date,btohqsg
Anyone else applied for cimb world mastercard recently? Applied on 1 dec but still not approved,btohqsg
5 days card arrived for my case,btohqsg
"Anyone used Amaze at overseas ATM yet?          How are the charges?          .....     ""ATM owner fee: This is the fee that the bank or card issuer charges for using their ATM overseas. This is typically displayed on the ATM before you make a withdrawal.Instarem fee: This is a fee thatâ€™s charged by Instarem for using amaze card for overseas cash withdrawal. amaze charges a fee of 2% of the value of the amount withdrawn.Dynamic currency conversion fee: This is a fee thatâ€™s charged if you withdraw money  not in the local (destination) currency.",btohqsg
Does Fave qualify for Citi SMRT Cashback if you buy something like an eCard?,btohqsg
Favepay generally considered as online. It should work as long as the ecard is not travel related,btohqsg
For citi rewards  by statement / posted date is also known as transacted date?,btohqsg
Anyone has RHB HYSA? I just deposited $$ . S the interest calculated on the last calendar day?,btohqsg
What about favepay at hawker centre / convenience shop?,btohqsg
