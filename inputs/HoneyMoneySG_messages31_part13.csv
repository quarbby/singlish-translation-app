even if you're spending ~1k a month  that's still 48k miles a year,btohqsg
ah yeah I put my expenses on the citi rewards usually but the spillovers have nowhere to go as of the moment,btohqsg
if you like miles revolution is better,btohqsg
Maybe put more on WWMC as the points expire earlier.,btohqsg
but even if miles altitude dbs is best what,btohqsg
Both Altitude and WWMC earn DBS points. DBS points can be converted to miles,btohqsg
how do you put local dining expenses on wwmc without the acceptance of amaze?,btohqsg
You can see this article (info is a bit outdated)https://blog.moneysmart.sg/credit-cards/why-the-best-air-miles-credit-card-may-not-be-an-air-miles-credit-card/,btohqsg
Oh not possible then  if you're doing the linkage with Amaze,btohqsg
maybe for offline spend  you use Amaze + CRMC. For online spend  you use WWMC,btohqsg
ahaha that's the thing. I don't have much online expense if at all other than company business travel expenses,btohqsg
A lot of things can be considered online expense mah. Anything you order on your phone or computer is online,btohqsg
You don't take Grab? Order food delivery? Even if you use the fairprice app at kopitiam food courts or koufu app at koufu food courts also considered online,btohqsg
I actually don't ahaha. maybe when I spend on mobile games and those can be placed on the the wwmc,btohqsg
grab is expensive. mrt is king.,btohqsg
I also don't Grab very often but the once in a while I take it it costs so much I might as well rack up the points for it,btohqsg
But if you don't spend a lot online then WWMC might not be the best second card for you lor. You said company travel expenses is your next biggest spend? Then maybe consider HSBC Revolution,btohqsg
why HSBC revolution? isn't that just wwmc but just 1k cap for travel flight and hotel bookings,btohqsg
Also can use for contactless transactions mah,btohqsg
and not just flight and hotel bookings,btohqsg
true uhh you're right. points duration also significantly longer.,btohqsg
FYI Just tried earlier it state promo code expired,btohqsg
Another alternative would be UOB Lady's Card with travel as your 10X category + UOB PPV for your everyday spending,btohqsg
That one is 2 cards  but you can pair your Lady's Card with Amaze to save on forex fees,btohqsg
I got the wwmc because of multiple company trips overseas per year that spends around 4-5k per time,btohqsg
HSBC revo 1k cap doesn't utilize it properly,btohqsg
ok what one time spend 4-5k,btohqsg
month long or longer stays in international hotels,btohqsg
Most miles cards exclude public transport so you can use SC Smart card for buses and trains  5.6mpd earn rate,btohqsg
Besides flight tickets  for what miles can be used? Sorry  never used miles strategy before,btohqsg
guys i wanna ask a qnwhat is a new card holderif i apply HSBC card Aisit new for me if i apply card Bfrom hsbc as well,btohqsg
No. Most t&c would have stated that new cardholder refers to no existing card from that bank or 12 months after cancellation of the only card.,btohqsg
Which platform ru buying on? DBS invest saver?,btohqsg
You need to use DBS Vickers rather than the Unit Trust platform. DBS only offers this ETF in Unit Trust form for DBS Invest Saver customers,btohqsg
U can try premiermiles? Don think got cap. N if u able to book thru kaligo for ur co trip  it's 10mpd,btohqsg

But hereâ€™s the good news - if you pay these merchants via your amaze wallet  you won't have to pay any fees!,btohqsg
What does it mean? Need to top up wallet ðŸ˜©,btohqsg

What the I didn't know that I need to use DBS Vickers,btohqsg
DP: Watami do not accept Krispay anymore,btohqsg
You should be buying under RSP Regular Savings Plan,btohqsg
No wonder I try buy the ETF using phone DBS app it show me nothing and using a laptop buying keep getting rejected,btohqsg
