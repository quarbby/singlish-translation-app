Yuu card is very polarising in my opinion haha. You need to charge exactly $600 each time to maximise the card. Any other amount is suboptimal depending how OCD you are.Comes in Visa and Amex so you can technically get up to $1200 every month.,btohqsg

Does buying money smart points count towards the spending criteria?,btohqsg
What about fairprice app  foodpanda  mcdonalds app,btohqsg
Was short of $0.90 for the minimum $500 spending with the SCB simplycash card. Don’t know Grab top up card didn’t count. Anyone here has had luck getting an appeal. I called and didn’t hear back for a month. Tried calling SCB today but it’s impossible to get through someone.,btohqsg
qualify period is as per TnC  no need sms,btohqsg
appeal for this kinda things will not work🥲,btohqsg
usually is can appeal but SCB is an S recent year where everything also don't want to entertain special requests...you can try to ask your RM to help  but if you don't have RM then a bit tough..i did manage to get a special request approved (credit lucky draw prize to Card A instead of Card B) but the officer said it was only because i am a long relationship customer with SCB then they approved it. (basically saying don't tell your friends to try  they won't approve it),btohqsg
Hi anybody knows of any singtel self service kiosk that is currently operational near Jurong or Tampines?,btohqsg
I think the higher possibility is because your bank account has lots of money and they are afraid you get annoyed and close your account and go to another bank.These days banks don't really care if you are in a long term or short term customer.,btohqsg
It matters a lot how long your relationship has been with the bank for various purposes:1. appeals2. special request/approval3. due dilligence checks4. credit limits granted5. relationship length bonuses (only for Citi Prestige),btohqsg
With AXS on the Maybank2u SG (Lite) app  paying bills is now more convenient and rewarding!We are giving away S$20 cash to each of the top 400 customers with the highest transaction count. Simply make a bill payment of minimum S$20 via AXS on the Maybank2u SG (Lite) app by 31 October 2024 to qualify. Hurry and start transacting now!LOL,btohqsg
What you said might be true because you have both. You are a HNW client   and a long term client.I have seen how clients walk into Paiza with shorts  shirt and slippers.  What happened to the strict dress code? If you are someone of HNW status  people will go out of the way to do favors for you.,btohqsg
How easy is Citi card annual fee wavier?,btohqsg
so far no issue for me to get Citibank waivable cards waived.of course premium cards cannot waive,btohqsg
Dont forget ma’am is long term customer with citi haha,btohqsg
Tbh so far citi has been nice with AF waiver for me. Last time i called to cancel my citi cashback to refresh my NTB before getting citi miles card. They waived my AF and got a good offer i cant say no.,btohqsg
But recently I Heard alot of Citi cards Kanna scammer haha those kind,btohqsg
Not scam. Fraudulent charges by BIN attack. It was citi a few months back. Recent attack was hsbc (i kenna hsbc one),btohqsg
Scammer don't target cards. They just target gullible people.,btohqsg
See u heng suay lor. Like mine hsbc revo keep in drawer so many months suddenly fraud,btohqsg
hello all  do yall know whether i will be eligible for both moneysmart/singsaver and from the bank sign up bonus or is it either or? thanks,btohqsg
Most of the time it's either or.,btohqsg
If you are kiasu like me  always lock credit card and only unlock when needed. Chances of getting your card hacked is lower.DBS has an additional function where you can set your limit. Eg your credit card limit is $1000. You can set your monthly use to $100. Just play around the amount according to your usage. And self increase when necessary. And on top of this  locked your card.The only time when my card can get hacked is that 1-2 mins when I unlocked my card to pay for a bill.,btohqsg
Oh i kenna too  trans name cowboy channel plus n netflix,btohqsg
May I ask  what kind of retention offer is good to stay or not enough and just cancel?,btohqsg
Spend 300 to get 300 credit. 😁,btohqsg
is there a difference when investing SRS in either Syfe or Endowus?,btohqsg
For me  if retention offer is better than vs waiting 1y + current NTB offer. 300 credit without waiting 1 year is good. Considering singsaver welcome gift can take long (a other 3-5 months) to fulfill,btohqsg
Difference lies in the management fee. Endowus fee < Syfe fee,btohqsg
do you think there is a material risk when it comes to solvency since Syfe is already profitable but Endowus is still not.?,btohqsg
Crcm. They are all online tranx except i cant confirm mcd cuz i usually ordered using FP. For mcd  i go down to kiosk and order using amaze.,btohqsg
