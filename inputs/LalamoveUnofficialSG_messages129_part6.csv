Came across a job deliver portable aircon est. 35 kg. The sender remarked that no MPV picking up the job so now see whether  car want to take. Lol.,btohqsg
Many times I thinking where to park the car before accepting the order. In the end itâ€™s gone,btohqsg
If need to park in the mall not worth the money  do u guys feel so?,btohqsg
If neighbourhood mall especially those just beside HDB you can park along service road. Thatâ€™s what i do,btohqsg
Hope no car takes thisâ€¦..otherwise they wouldnâ€™t learn,btohqsg
Any one doing 1.7m van here? Do u all carry item up(unit) for the customer,btohqsg
The person just watch you carry?,btohqsg
$1 5 stops hahahah fucking Lalamove so funny,btohqsg
All the special orders all $1,btohqsg
Iâ€™m curious have you guys tried adding waiting fee to oddle orders? They always make us wait so long,btohqsg
Hi guys. Left lalamove for a while now and is returning on a motorbike. Can I check how's it like now? Cause grab and panda quite bad now,btohqsg
Lala better a lot compare to last time,btohqsg
My advice is to do short distance one. Sometimes they pay higher than far,btohqsg
I came across before but never accepted order because is just $1,btohqsg
Haven't tried grab and panda. Imo it's not good on LLM... Maybe it is okay if you work during good hours.,btohqsg
How much loyalty is LLM paying you to say this?,btohqsg

Did anyone encountered tapping LLM postcode or address to open google map but it bring you to the wrong location?,btohqsg
I encountered a few times. Sometimes the address is inaccurate,btohqsg
Yes sometimes not accurate. best to double check before moving off,btohqsg
A few times it happened to me but not often,btohqsg
Usually is new condo/HDB or industrial areas that have this issue,btohqsg
Not sure if the wrong address issues affect payout price? ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
Postal Code sometimes can Miss 1 Big Roud as some Condo is Beside Gate so GPS Put enter small Gate. Best is Check Full Addresz or Name of Codo more Accurate,btohqsg
Yes yes.. Last Thursday I kena one at punggol. Postal code 828685  it brought me to hdb. Instead itâ€™s a condo named The terrace.,btohqsg
Knn make me go one big round,btohqsg
I message the sender asked her to input full address next time for more accurate location but she replied LLM app only requested postal code and unit number only,btohqsg
Now only I know why I always see only postal code and unit number only in LLM app when accepting order.,btohqsg
Especially if condo  no condo name only postal code,btohqsg
And some condo name is different from the one that you see in app,btohqsg
You go Try Bukit Timah. Miss Entrance have to UTurn Opp then UTurn Back. The Turn To And Fro NOT short distance alsoðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
Wah jialat waste time waste petrol,btohqsg
The default navigation i set to use google map.. anyone know how to reset the thing?,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t find any in LLM setting,btohqsg
9 out of 10 courier jobs and they ainâ€™t up-ing the priceâ€¦..tskâ€¦â€¦,btohqsg
Ya sometimes it happens.. Abit irritating,btohqsg
I realise the maps not good with condo. Always take me to the hdb beside it and then need to go one big round again,btohqsg
Tmr back to low ball fares again,btohqsg
Anyone meet a order forBuy for me with big tips?,btohqsg
