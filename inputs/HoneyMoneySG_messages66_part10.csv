Hi  may I ask if its dangerous to withdraw money from ATM using my credit card? I read about it considered to be cash loans with interest rates based on the participating bank and ruining credit score. But asking for a friend  he does it with a UOB card and it appears in his account statement instead of his credit card's one. Does that mean in that situation  that is okay?,btohqsg
He linked his savings account to his credit card.So when he withdraw at atm using the credit card it is taking from savings account.,btohqsg
It is a setting in the UOB app for his case to allow ATM withdrawal on credit card?,btohqsg
Correct. U can choose the bank account to link to in uob app,btohqsg

hihi experts  i got a one-time big ticket purchase of $12 000. I'm looking at UOB Lady Solitaire (max cap $3000 * 6mpd = 18 000 miles) vs DBS Vantage (12 000 * 1.5mpd = 18 000 miles).
