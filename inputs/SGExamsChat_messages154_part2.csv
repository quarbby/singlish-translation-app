huh omg what school you from why is everyone so fast,btohqsg
Just that some ppl can accept things in their life being so orchestrated,btohqsg
As opposed to going with the flow,btohqsg
I want to see people from my class start dating each other that would be fun.,btohqsg
Omgg thats the most bothersome thing ever ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Then we no longer hang out as friends so innocent,btohqsg
It would be so cool to see them try to hide it.,btohqsg
Like my this friend is dating that friend,btohqsg
So we have to start giving them space,btohqsg
And we no longer can hang out casually as a whole class like before,btohqsg
oh me and the boys in the class hang out together so I just started shipping random people together,btohqsg
can lah just let them walk in front and sit together,btohqsg
The dated ones are like lying on their existing friends like a mattress while the still single ones have to put up with their exclusiveness while still being there for them and everyone else . Ugh unbalance availability,btohqsg
then watch them panic trying to hide their secret relationship,btohqsg

My chemistry teacher was like oh chemistry very easy for me so I take double h3,btohqsg
Some ppl say chem is the most complicated.. i kind of agree lei..,btohqsg
