Car sellers on sgcarmart usually list cars based on the name registered with LTA log book iirc,btohqsg
so  why is e36 so uch cheaper,btohqsg

Likewise  Civic ES/EP is the forgotten Civic.,btohqsg
I know there is a beetle cabrio selling for 150K (but black plate) ü§≠,btohqsg
i cannot remember what engine e36 316 uses,btohqsg
m10 is too old. carburetted engine i think,btohqsg
used ins e21? or is it e23,btohqsg
There is a fuel Injected model.,btohqsg
At the launch of the E30 range in 1982  the 316 used a 1766 cc version of the M10 fed by a carburetor and producing 66 kW (89 hp).[31][39] The 318i had the same M10 engine  but with Bosch L-Jetronic fuel-injection  increasing power to 77 kW (103 hp)[31][40] while also improving fuel economy.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series_(E30)#Four-cylinder_petrol,btohqsg
that 1990 e30 is the last of e30. face lifted very ood,btohqsg
face lift: plastic bumper integrated. no chrome,btohqsg
better looking as the bumper flushed nicely with body,btohqsg
I think plastic bumper looks better.,btohqsg
