Not me. Possibly unpopular opinion but I think Taylor swift is popular more because of her looks than music,btohqsg
Josh vs ian is gonna be so üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
I think ppl like Susan Boyle who has a beautiful voice aren‚Äôt as popular cos she just doesn‚Äôt have the looks,btohqsg
imagine them having a heated debate,btohqsg
I think taylor swift is popular because of her music but not because her vocals are very good (they are good but not on the level of ppl like adele or whitney houston) or her songs are very poetic in meaning. I think is because her music appeals to a wide demographic and is also general public friendly thats why she so popular,btohqsg
Taylor swift is a gd songwriter but not a good singer,btohqsg
Like people may say her songs all about love and heartbreak  but those are themes that is relatable to teenagers  young adults etc that make up a big part of her fanbase,btohqsg
Not an amazing singer I mean,btohqsg
She is good enough at singing to make it sound nice to the average public  but ofc she not on the same level as like Adele la,btohqsg
When Josh comes back on April first,btohqsg
Can u trigger an argument with him,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not going to risk suffering the emotional damage if I were Josh lol,btohqsg

no josh is textbook insecure af,btohqsg
"Hes ""woke"" cuz he thinks it's cool to be woke",btohqsg
Idt he actually knows what he's saying,btohqsg
Let me just send what he say,btohqsg
Left leaning societies which is what wokeism tends to refer to just means societies that put their trust in systems over people,btohqsg
i will shit on him here until i get shit talked on discord,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like a rite of passage,btohqsg
"But like idk half the woke people ik don't even know this and they're like ""oh I'm left leaning""",btohqsg
being woke is the biggest indicator of having a low verbal iq,btohqsg
Ya that's what left leaning is defined as what,btohqsg
they segregate people into arbitrary groups of oppressor vs oppressed,btohqsg
@twosevenoffi think i deleted most of the screenshots i had alr but then tekki is josh just in case udk who he is,btohqsg
and blame the systems of society af large,btohqsg
