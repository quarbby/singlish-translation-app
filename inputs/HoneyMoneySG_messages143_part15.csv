"Just a note that the 3.5% is on yourincremental investment  not the total holding value.Somewhat ""worth"" if you are comparing 3-mth fixed D rates (~3%) + the 3.5% is guaranteed as Mari will top up the return to make it 3.5%.",btohqsg

sorry I tried to search the chat for 5944 and it seems that for Citi rewards we should be able to get 4mpd for 5944 transactions? but when I search the tncs 5944 doesn't seem to be inside. Is it because if I pair with amaze it will automatically qualify as a transaction eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Amaze does not change the mcc code,btohqsg
You get 4mpd on CRMC for online transactions (except mobile wallet and travel-related). Amaze converts an offline transaction to an online one  hence you are able to get 4mpd.,btohqsg
@antonio191203there's a need for incremental increase to reach that 4.05% so it's not a purely put for a month and get 4.05% so it does not work for me. thanks for your suggestion,btohqsg
Bonus is not in same month anyway.,btohqsg
It IS put for a month and get 4.05% p.a.When you open a fresh new account  anything you put in IS incremental funds.,btohqsg
Yes  but from last month should appear this month  right?,btohqsg
I mean from Oct bonus  I see it in my statement  but not in the app transaction,btohqsg
Just double check in Rewards tab in app  only have Earned and Returned,btohqsg
Is amyone using singtel direct billing carrier? I cannot locate it for huawei,btohqsg
My original statement is bonus and base point is seperated which is not wrong by itself. So if u only see base in app also is a improvement isnt it. I also reply to anthony that bonus is not included. So i dont see why the scrutiny by u when i am sharing new update?In the first place i did not even say bonus point is inside?,btohqsg
HSBC EGA and SC Esaver 30-day rule for fresh funds  has it been enforced already? i remove funds on 1 Nov. I seems to be within the 30 day rule for the promotion starting on 1 Dec.,btohqsg

Can try investing in equity instead of bank deposit.Based on a 200k invested in equity fund  possible returns is about $3.5k weekly if willing to risk,btohqsg
There is recent news on giving out investment advice so I'd err on that side.,btohqsg
