Like to share my bad experience picking up an order at Royal Indian restaurant at Jalan Besar this morning.,btohqsg
I accepted the order at 3:10 this morning. I called to confirm the order with the shop and made my way down. When I reached the shop  the staff told me their are still preparing the food and need another 5 mins. While waiting  the staff told me that he is going to add another destination (20 Swiss road)  but he told me verbally and he said he will add $5 for the extra location. He said he will pay me cash and not edit the order. I told the staff that I can‚Äôt accept the order because I have another pick up at 4:10am and that I won‚Äôt be on time for the next pick up. If I am late for pick up  i can‚Äôt prove that I had to deliver to another location because on the app  this order number only shows one delivery destination. Furthermore the distance of the second location is too far from the Sentosa (original delivery location). Upon hearing that I am not agreeable to his suggestion  he told me he have to cancel the job. I said it is not fair for me as I have been waiting close to 10 mins already at the shop and I have travelled all the way down to the shop to pick up this order. After a few minutes of exchanges between me and the staff  he went head and cancelled the order in front of my eyes via his order terminal. I said this is not fair for me and if he wanted to add another location  he should have posted the original order with the 2 locations instead and any drivers could see and decide if they can fulfil this order or not based on the 2 locations. He told me if he did that  he won‚Äôt get a driver at this hour (3am). And he also told me that he is not obligated to tell me anything before hand. He said he is entitled to add and cancel the job any time as he pleases. I asked him so now in this instance  how do we settle this. He said there is nothing to settle as the job is already cancelled and I can leave. Please take note of this merchant‚Äôs behaviour as it will cause many drivers and riders a lot of inconvenience and wasted time due to the shop staff unethical behaviour.,btohqsg
Can tell cs then get compensation,btohqsg
Perhaps next time just strap body cam..  Lol,btohqsg
Actually got afew vendor can siam just siam they very chao kuan one. Lao jiao should know this ahJalan besarNovenaEast coast road nearby katongü§´Never write shop name horü§´,btohqsg

Looks like a competitor of lalamove. However by giving phone number of clients' number is very dangerous though.... As lalamove may sue us for disclosure of clients' number if we are found out to earn incentives by bleaching the privacy of clients. Hmmm. I dont think this is legal.,btohqsg
Randall ng should approach lalamove instead. Not over here. To save your own ass.,btohqsg
Hey Serene  will clear some of your doubts here  our research project is not a competitor with Lalamove üòäOur submissions will require a restaurant‚Äôs business name and a phone number  both of which can be commonly found on Google  so we have ensured that there is no breaching of privacy and data.As mentioned  this is a research project to identify trends with Lalamove deliveries and we are thankful for the initial responses we received so far! ü•≥ü•≥Special mention to one rider that raked in $60 over the weekend btw! ü§©We still have a couple of slots left before we close our registration  please join our project if you are looking to earn additional incentives on every ride you make  feel free to send in your questions to -98060534Hope this helps Serene  and thank you everyone!,btohqsg

on my off day usually ill do $150-200 from 10am till 8pm,btohqsg
Ouhk. That is the maximun issit boss? Btw thank u in advanced yaüòá,btohqsg
but by then i just wanna chill,btohqsg
Ouh ic.. car fare is usually what is their rate?,btohqsg
and there are breaks in between,btohqsg
depends. i take motorcycle job also,btohqsg
Ouh ic.. so u mean all job avail u take? okok boss thank u for the info.,btohqsg
Correct me if I am wrong. according to CS is ok if pick up delay as long fall within 2 hr,btohqsg
Pick up cannot late boss.What they mean was u pick up and load & drop off and unload inclusive of travelling in the 2hrs duration for moving services.,btohqsg
I reach the pick up location within 15min. After which I slide arrived pick up location. However  there a delay due to no one at home.,btohqsg
I waited till 30min then pick up cargo. Therefore  my understanding for immediate job. When driver arrived the location thing must be ready. If delay after 10min  we can start charging them late charges,btohqsg
In this case  CS replied that all withing time frame of 2 hrs is ok.I told them like that eat grass Liao la.. if really suay kena a 1.7van job and completed near to 2 hrs. Estimation $30++ job for 2 hours.,btohqsg
"For your info  if I never interpreted wrongly.. 2hrs for ""delivery time frame"" after pick up for Van and lorry",btohqsg
"2 key point.- 2hrs ""delivery"" time frame- ""after pick up""",btohqsg
Haha never mind Liao la.. as usual we got no time to play with them! However  it's make us like a fool when talking about their poor guideline/SOP standard.,btohqsg

Go to your nearest park and walk. If u do llm at 9plus mostly sit in car only,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt you do and find out for yourself?,btohqsg
Everyone‚Äôs earning is diff depending on lifestyle and number of jobs done a month.,btohqsg
Anyone knows any contact number to contact Lalamove.. tried their live chat to reschedule my collection of lalakit but nobody replied..,btohqsg
and u can schedule another date on the app,btohqsg

llm is very slow at this timing. if really have to do 10pm to 1am better off with panda or grab.,btohqsg
Wa so much different... After minus my patrol even lesser,btohqsg
Bad rate but what to do..,btohqsg
Beware bro  bcse it happened to me. I picked up 3 packets of durian. Then when i go in my van  the order cancelled. So i take it as it‚Äôs cancelled. Then I continue do other orders for like 3hrs. Then when i check back my app  the durian order suddenly on going. So i deliver one by one  the next day they tell me the food all spoiled alrdy  so I explained to them what happen. Then in 2 weeks they sent me this text on whatsapp and my account suspended.,btohqsg

But so far so good.. no complaints lol never kena suspend too,btohqsg
anyway even if inform they also don't know what to do one la,btohqsg
The SOP for llm is to return the parcel. We got used to keeping the food on cancelling  but that is only the food platforms' SOP  not llm's. In llm  the courier is liable for loss or damage of the parcel - you signed the TOC when you signed up for llm. That's why llm can charge damage or loss to the courier  even for food.,btohqsg
if return the food  will end up in the rubbish bin. might as well eat it. lol,btohqsg
yes  but you just need to be covered by black and white  or the customer can pin it on you. has already happened to a few couriers.,btohqsg
no need to scare. I ever done 4 jobs concurrently. lol.,btohqsg
remember some courier posted being made to paid for damaged cake and another one for cancelled durian order.,btohqsg
Hi guys  how do I update my mode of delivery?,btohqsg
Anyone tried doing llm w rental van before  worth?,btohqsg

Seems not bad eh  after rental petrol maybe 80++,btohqsg
Ya around there.can whack somemore but always lazy,btohqsg

I dont know why i dont have mission for so long,btohqsg

if you want update to van or lorry  direct go to LLM Ubi customer service centre (apply to new user)   if not you can just update in LLM app,btohqsg
how much does it cost to use lalamove move a dining table?,btohqsg

Mini themal bag also very big if walker very hard,btohqsg
not me .first time see other kanna ban,btohqsg
...perm ban sia....must be very terrible incident till llm ban that acc,btohqsg
Actually service quality is rated by llm and sender?,btohqsg
hi  im going down tomorrow to collect the big lalamove bag  just wondering if anyone can tell me whether the bag is folded from the start  thus making it easily stored  or its like all set-up (like grab bag) upon collection,btohqsg
Not really for mine.. most orders even other platform the food either barely fits or just cannot at all..,btohqsg
yes it is folded and in a plastic bag,btohqsg
they wont provide a carrier for you though,btohqsg
no problem  i think i can stuff inside my MFC delivery bag since its folded,btohqsg
would you recommended i fix the bag straight away and strap it onto my bike?,btohqsg
Bro  any idea why I didn't received any mission from LLM ? I joined 1 month ago,btohqsg
have been refreshing my mission tab  but no mission was pop out,btohqsg
U need to do monday to wed for at least 5 pick . Then only got mission de,btohqsg
Means from Monday to Wednesday need do 15 trips? Or just do 5 trips within Mon to Wednesday?,btohqsg
Because mine didn't appear as well,btohqsg
For mission  they only give to the top 15 percent or 20 percent of driversHow they rate u is base on number of order  and rating and cancellation rateThe higher score u get  the better mission u getBronze  silver  gold etcGold mission reward highest etcJuz an example  i dun knw e exact reward,btohqsg
Another kind of mission is if u afk lalamove for 1 to 2 month. Will have return mission for u. Like 20 to 30 dollar  to do 1 order,btohqsg
5 should be enough    no need 15  if total no do comfirm dont have mission de,btohqsg
I mia for 2 year still no have,btohqsg
Hi guys I'm new to this...,btohqsg
Hi guys  I'm new to food delivery... Can I ask  how do you carry drinks or soup without spilling,btohqsg
Everytime I put in the bag it spills,btohqsg
If you can put your divider near to either side of the bag,btohqsg
If not its extremely easy to spill the water/soup,btohqsg
Just adjust the item size accordingly so at least the items will not spill,btohqsg
How come the bag that I got from lalamove got no divider?,btohqsg
Huh? They suppose to provide de HAHAHA,btohqsg
Another method is buying a $8 cup holder le,btohqsg
Hi guys I'm new rider here may I know what is oddle item mean and how to know rider and van all I see courier only thanks,btohqsg

Please exercise caution to avoid being scammed or get involved in money laundering.,btohqsg
Sometimes it‚Äôs cos nobody take their orders until quite late  then they panic n kpkb whoever sway take their order. Kns one  I avoid taking their orders  kena before arrive at merchant collected food  just before I click collected  they cancel so I asked CS. Told me to return food and was not paid a cent. Our Petrol  time n parking machiam free,btohqsg
They check multiple platform for lowest price. So unless you are very near the shop  otherwise best to avoid their orders. They can suka suka add location or cancel as they please. You won‚Äôt get a cent.,btohqsg
Every single delivery platform have its up and downs.. I ownself collected bonchon from plq mall go back punggol while I was delivering my previous order they keep texting non stop also like ugh,btohqsg
Hii  anyone can advise on what can be done if i keep getting this notif,btohqsg
My internet/wifi working fine. I can only see orders from drop down notifications  instead of from the app itself,btohqsg
Perhaps removing the filters will help,btohqsg
Yup  even after i reset still same. Been getting this error on and off for quite some time,btohqsg
I'm new. Lalamove usually for cars 1 slot how many location?,btohqsg
But better to prepare a thermal bag if it's food..,btohqsg
usually one  but you pick the jobs you want  they are not assigned to you  so you can choose or avoid multistop jobs when picking up jobs.,btohqsg
Is the job still priority to sticker driver or things have change around here?,btohqsg
I'm sure there's alot of cars/van with stickers or decals.. but I not so sure as I'm a walker..,btohqsg
For me I usually able to niap some bid orders but I only take instant accepted orders..,btohqsg
So I not sure about the rate..,btohqsg
New app just launch for bikers,btohqsg
If u need to rent bike to do llm,btohqsg
SINPASS to verify credential so quite safe,btohqsg
Anyone got lobang for fridge lorry  need to send one big big big cake 7FT x 9FT from bedok to loyang at feb 2023  interested PM me  thanks,btohqsg
Anybody app having issue? I reset all filter but cannot see any job,btohqsg
Ok nvm. My app suddenly damn weird. If i set to see all job  then nothing comes out. I have to set to either now and today or next 30 days.,btohqsg
is using van more job for LLM than car,btohqsg
Car/mpv more order than van.i using van cos use diesel.lower costüòÖ,btohqsg
Good stuffs. All deliver for stuff d. Lot 1 hillion mall,btohqsg
Stack all close to 90 liao,btohqsg
but high fare rite. 1 trip I heard at least 60,btohqsg
everyday do 4 can close shop,btohqsg
Like this u think ok or not 4 stops,btohqsg
After deduct 60+ only.same2 if u take car/mpv jobüòÖ,btohqsg
4 drop.dont know how jialat the order.,btohqsg
Well ü§∑ we will never know until we arrive,btohqsg
How U all survive doing lalamove in car some orders r just crazy,btohqsg
Hur hur.. I not driving üòÇ,btohqsg
Especially alot of oodle orders collecting at mall,btohqsg
Oddle is easy  only parcel is more complicated,btohqsg
Plan your route  car/moto drivers tend to stack orders to earn more,btohqsg
What's the highest can earn in a day normally?,btohqsg
Well I'm a walker so.. for car/moto I not so sure,btohqsg
I didn't know got walker like more tough,btohqsg
I more on the relek side,btohqsg
can i check  for the big lalamove bag  what do you guys use as dividers?,btohqsg
They provide a velcro divider.. correct me if I'm wrong..,btohqsg
Oh is it  when i collected i dont seem to have any  only the white plastic board that i assume its for the base of the bag,btohqsg
The white board should be for the bottom of the bag..,btohqsg
Get some plastic board to use it as a divider I guess? ü§∑,btohqsg
You can DIY your dividers. Can head down to Art friend to buy plastic board and ownself cut to fit your MFC/bags. üëç,btohqsg
Hi Dyf  can show me a photo of the lala bag on your bike? I have issues with it  dk how to properly tie it down on my bike.,btohqsg
hey  are you using the big or small lala bag,btohqsg
i just got the big one but i havent been able to try it on my bike yet,btohqsg
Hmm.. base on my experience with my ebike last time you can try bungee on your bike..,btohqsg
I using small bag. I have a box too,btohqsg
I cannot be like carrying the big one around like idiot HAHAHA,btohqsg
ah yes i also got a box  so i think the big lalamove might abit too space-constraint for me,btohqsg
I tie the cord to my bike box but the lalakit becomes slunted and sometimes it came off from the cord. Haha,btohqsg
Hmm.. try getting a rack to put on,btohqsg
Poke some holes on the bottom of the bag and cable tie it,btohqsg
the small bag doesnt have the straw frame is it,btohqsg
This helps alot! Will do tht later on,btohqsg
What straw you talking about? O.o?,btohqsg
It has  but if i hook the cord onto the frame  i cant close the kit propery,btohqsg
Honestly hooking with the cord is risky,btohqsg
Cable ties and heavy duty velcro from spotlight would be a good fix..,btohqsg
Well velcro eventually wears down if the person need to carry passenger take out and put back on the bike,btohqsg
Cable tie with a rack for motorcycle is the perfect combination in my opinion,btohqsg
There are heavy duty ones where you can use. But once you set it in.. Seperating the velcro may end up damaging the bag.. üòÇ,btohqsg
But then again. Just some of my suggestions. It's not 100% foolproof. ü•≤,btohqsg
Hello all. join as I do lalamove part time on weekends  thinking of going full time actually.,btohqsg
am contemplating if i should get the lalabag for the district filters.,btohqsg
if you are going full time  can strongly consider since its your ricebowl. Easier to filter and plan out,btohqsg
ohh  so it does help? i see that you need to go down to collect it  need time to process? if i buy now can i get it by this week?,btohqsg
apparently you get 30% higher chance to win orders too.when you click on the bag that you want  the next page will show the date available for appointment to pick up,btohqsg
its either 9am - 1pm or 2pm - 6pm. then the whole process very fast  head down  about 5-10mins can completed. I collected mine last week,btohqsg
alright got it thanks  i gotta explain to my dad why yet another bag appeared at home later hahaha...,btohqsg
i have a littlebike bag  a foodpanda bag and now gonna have lalabag,btohqsg
alright  the big lalabag is quite big so just a heads up. if your bike already has a box  you may have some trouble tying it down to your bike,btohqsg
yeah  the foodpanda bag for motor is huuuge. i think i buying the small lalabag as any bag also give you the benefits,btohqsg
anything else i will put into the box,btohqsg
yeah that works as well  good luck!,btohqsg
Well if you have the small LLM bag and a giant panda bag you should be fine ü§∑,btohqsg
do you have to actually use the lalabag for the district filters though?,btohqsg
I Don filter I be honest.. and I always go pretty far üòÇ,btohqsg
And I Don own any motor vehicles tbh,btohqsg
wow  so you register as walker or something?,btohqsg
At first I use my pab  but didn't do any orders after that until my ebike permanently down then I started doing LLM,btohqsg
ah  so walker do get jobs  i only seeing in the fb comments that they not getting jobs. taking that much public transport means you probably gotten concession ?,btohqsg
As of now not yet üòÇ,btohqsg
Waiting for translink to give me the consession I be honest.. take up to 4 weeks,btohqsg

I parking only they saw me then call me chow   nothing happened,btohqsg
Thats y. I also want to chiao when they call. My bike cannot start. Kanasai..,btohqsg
up to $2000  and/or 3 months jail for motorbike on footpath.,btohqsg
^ actually i dont know if this is for town only  seems too high. my last pavement parking fine was $70  about 2 years ago.,btohqsg
but who'd ever get 3 months jail lol,btohqsg
i can see jail happening if someone gets burned on a hot exhaust or if the bike topples on a kid  or something like that.,btohqsg
damn  toppling on a kid haha,btohqsg
must be the kid go and topple it on himself üòÇ,btohqsg
According to the document parking at pavement got demerit points so as a 12 point p plate I don‚Äôt park pavement at all. I‚Äôll risk double yellow which is supposedly a $250 fine but no points or jail,btohqsg
If not I‚Äôll just park in HDB nearby even if I lose time,btohqsg
I hate the most is Waterway Point. No place to even illegally park. Wanna legally park have to join the long queue,btohqsg
Waterway point is the worse place to collect orders..,btohqsg
Yeah.. good for ebike cus they can park anyhow. Motorcycle very restricted,btohqsg
Ya.. but enforcement for ebikes also extremely strict üò™,btohqsg
Haha real pity cus there a lot of orders,btohqsg
Got alot uh? I always check nothing one.. for llm,btohqsg
Unless you trying to say grabfood all those then ah I understand,btohqsg
For foodpanda can have quite a bit,btohqsg
Yeh i do panda sometimes. Cus panda very inflexible. Must book shift and this is a part time I cannot always commit to the shift,btohqsg
True  but I hate their system tbh,btohqsg
But panda earns more than llm cus of the short distance,btohqsg
That's why I'm thinking of getting lalabag for district orders,btohqsg
I ownself have their thermal bag,btohqsg
Cus deliveroo dun wanna accept my application also... say too many riders,btohqsg
Too many riders they want pause first,btohqsg
How's the district filters  actually shorter distance?,btohqsg
Hmm  depends on how you look at it,btohqsg
Not like Amazon open flood gate n lower price pol,btohqsg
Is less of the bag but more of unlocking the district filter for me,btohqsg
Even though deliveroo is a small company,btohqsg
For me not really üòÇ barely fits medium orders,btohqsg
Their distance is like from raffles to orchard,btohqsg
If you are super lucky  just opposite pickup point,btohqsg
I mean benefits lol I dun care ABT keeping food warm ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
I do care üòÇ perfect service HAHAHA,btohqsg
