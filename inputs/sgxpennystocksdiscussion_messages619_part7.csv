Our Dino 🦖 rEx roared.. 47c cleared,btohqsg
GSS nice flush and recover it seems. Looks like coming. Well controlled indeed. Good luck,btohqsg
Last week someone said gss chart not nice leh,btohqsg
Feel like buying gss got buy RH,btohqsg
Today's PA a little odd. Gap then run 2 bids then flush then suddenly 72 bites come again. I saw a lot of late stacking blinking 77 to 80.I think this one the players in control.RH also flushed many out before the initial break out run.Oilies hot. GSS energy have oil field yea.Got chance i feel but DYODD.and current price still quite safe.,btohqsg
Market very good. Rex soon will be 1b market cap.,btohqsg
Rex is like infant stage of Geo when it's at 25c.,btohqsg
When the recurring cash flow come it. It will be a wow,btohqsg
Does this mean will definitely grow?,btohqsg
GSS Energy. ($0.071/$0.072)- this counter well controlled. PA not the easiest to read as there are buyers and sellers at the same timeBut Oilies Ain focus and they happen to be in the right business. I don’t think BBs will let this opportunity go.DYODD   EP 71 should be quite safe IMO.Good luck 🤞🏽,btohqsg

Calling All BBs on Amos Group. I believe the time is now. This one if BBs come  easy push to 300 honestly.ShawKweii Partners last purchase was Approx. $0.012 before consolidation (After consolidation price of $0.240)There is no real selling pressure in AMOS besides Danny Lien whom i heard needed money to re built his house and that was why he cashed out from open market.But from close sources  he is no longer selling.Hence  no selling pressure on this counter.Oil in Play  this one should not be missed out.DYODD okay.,btohqsg
tmr all huat     in 50 series !!,btohqsg
Amos 😳 8 lot done.... One night stand counter,btohqsg
Our RH PetroGas+19.7%40series ai cross🤞 liao har🤣,btohqsg
AMOS Group business summary for easy reference.Energy  Oil and Gas  Marine up   they benefit Amos Group.DYODD.Current prices way too cheap for a $0.6x NAV counter,btohqsg
Need to call for BBs to come . They should come . Good opportunity for them RRR wise .,btohqsg
GSS Energy. (71/72)- past years Profitable- No Debt- NAV $0.011x🙏🏻 DYoDD,btohqsg
My View on Amos Group counter is that they are giving chips at cheap to retailers.They want to invite retailers participation and chatter.So they lose some first perhaps.When they clear above $0.20 then everyone suddenly interested  shouting breakout 😂DYODD,btohqsg
