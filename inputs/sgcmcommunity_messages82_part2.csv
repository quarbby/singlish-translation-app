I doubt I’ll driveaway with a Polestar with this experience. But@arnavgulianishould we get the mini to drive when I have it so he buys one?,btohqsg
let me undercut then i charge $800 for a week,btohqsg
easily cover the installment and maybe can sell the car for a profit,btohqsg
thats an expensive test drive for a week,btohqsg
worth to rent for a week? maybe.Worth to lease? only if you drive alot. Increase mileage on a car decreases resale and battery health  which affects resale  maint etc...,btohqsg
Model 3 lease is also close to 4k a month,btohqsg
Considering the road tax and insurance premiums  actually not paying a lot more for peace of mind,btohqsg
Paying 4k a month for car is never worth it,btohqsg
Unless you're an expat with everything covered by company,btohqsg
Pay 4 k a month to sit at the cafe wait for car to charge,btohqsg
i have a friend leasing long term from wearnes a Polestar 2 LRDM,btohqsg
his mileage easily 50-60k a year,btohqsg
Well…not a Model 3 or a Polestar...,btohqsg
Charge 45mins  30 customers will pump petrol and pay at counter and smile at u and ur 4k a mth.,btohqsg
What the fudgination does he do…?,btohqsg
imagine the battery health after 2 years 😂😂😂,btohqsg
i think it make sense ba,btohqsg
How I wish my company pays for the car,btohqsg
WHAT!!! WHERE DO I SIGN UP!,btohqsg
Cost of owning a tesla sr+ for a monthDepre 20k/yr = 1.7k/mthRoad tax 3k/yr = 250/mthInsurance 3k/yr = 250/mthTotal = 2.2k/mthNot factoring loan interest  petrol savings  and other misc stuffs. Last yr when i checked there was lease rates of 3.5k/mth.So to me  its not a lot to pay for ev experience.,btohqsg
I could use an extra $1K and still get to drive the Polestar,btohqsg
Oh. Have to pay ah. Thought they pay me so good,btohqsg
HAHAHA free rental plus get paid 1k. where to find?,btohqsg
I thought SGCM rocks one mahh 😅,btohqsg

I’ll take whatever I can get sir 😊😊,btohqsg

19k depre is almost the price before market bull run,btohqsg
WP holder can mah? You drive M3 maybe a bit overqualified sir,btohqsg
no no no  its just a 318i m sport,btohqsg
sounds like m3 because i have maxhaust,btohqsg
Rocco depreciation of 12k is like a steal,btohqsg
Ya compared to golf 14k depre,btohqsg

I love Rocco but dare not commit,btohqsg

i believe the ARF less than 20k after rebates,btohqsg
Actually  what's the diff between omv and arf?,btohqsg
"and while the arf is ridiculously low  also means purchase price ""lower""",btohqsg
without the rebate we probably pay 45k more,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admin  the total basic cost dont add up,btohqsg
total basic cost should be 156208,btohqsg
government say want to promote ev but AD come out this kind of pattern.... lets just stick to V8❤️❤️,btohqsg
they will have to close down if they cant make their ev price competitive,btohqsg
aiya govt also dont 100% committed to EV  why still impose fuel tax,btohqsg
to recoup your rediscover voucher 😈😈,btohqsg
the formentor 190 is now going for 13% premium,btohqsg

I think Mr mini will throw some signs in our face and say a few words when he hears the pricing,btohqsg
