i always thought it was the other way around-- probably another misconception tsk,btohqsg
Man isn't that a grey area or smth,btohqsg
But if heâ€™s been so easily manipulated once  then whoâ€™s to say he wonâ€™t be the next time?,btohqsg
Yeah injection is wayy more expensive,btohqsg

You know speaking of hanging  do you know there's like diff positions which the hanger can position the noose such that it is painless,btohqsg
Personally Iâ€™d say bullet to the head is the least painful way to go  not sure why they wouldnâ€™t adopt that,btohqsg
Yeah they literally do math with the bodyâ€™s weight for different kinds of drops  long and short drops or smth so that itâ€™s as painless as possible,btohqsg
And it's really int because the hanger has been doing it for years,btohqsg
Pretty cool uk the factors they'd consider,btohqsg

"""Death row conditionsA 1978 newspaper article described the death row section of the original Changi Prison as consisting of 24 cells arranged in a horse shoe shaped block around an open air grassy exercise yard. The exercise area itself was enclosed in steel bars and had a wire mesh roof to prevent escape by helicopter.[93] Amnesty International reports that death row inmates are housed in cells of roughly three square metres (32 square feet).[16] Walls make up three sides  while the fourth is made up of vertical bars. They are equipped with a toilet  a sleeping mat  and a bucket for washing. Exercise is permitted twice a day for half an hour at a time.[8] Four days before the execution  the condemned is allowed to watch television or listen to the radio.[16]Special meals of their choice are also cooked  if within the prison budget. One documented last meal of an inmate was the last meal order of Tangaraju Suppiah  who asked for chicken rice  ice cream soda  nasi biryani and Milo-flavoured sweets before his hanging  while another was John Martin Scripps  who ordered a pizza and a cup of hot chocolate before his execution.[94][95]Visiting rights are increased from one 20-minute visit per week to a maximum of four hours each day [8] though no physical contact is allowed with any visitors.[16] In addition  two days before an execution  an inmate is allowed to have a photo shoot and be given their own clothes to pose during a photoshoot; the photo will be given to their families as remembrance.[96]""",btohqsg
