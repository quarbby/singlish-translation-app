Regular customer then regular la. No diff,btohqsg
Building management and security guards are bastards  threaten to clamp bike.Why at an office/mall loading bay cannot be used by motorcycle delivery (only 10min). It was super empty and there are no clear signs that it's restricted for trucks only.,btohqsg
That's why I avoid doing condo deliveries also. 50% of the time the condo security guards always rude af  don't know for what,btohqsg
Even if go in as a guest  condo security guards also damn rude,btohqsg
Btw  UParcel price so good? I am a rider. Haha  what's the catch? And are we allowed to stack?,btohqsg
No idea. My account not activated yet,btohqsg
Can see but cannot click haha,btohqsg
Wow‚Ä¶..new player uh? Good rates tho‚Ä¶.whats the cut?,btohqsg
2 pick 3 drop off $21‚Ä¶.. good price meh?,btohqsg
Oh just realise the number lol,btohqsg
Uparcel has 3to4 hour delivery window  and single job rates are very low. Can assume stacking is the norm.,btohqsg
But motorbike might be hard to stack too many  space constraint.,btohqsg
Looking for male social escort.Legit. No cash upfront. No scam.Or female looking for a companion for drinking session are welcomed too.,btohqsg
$35 for 5 locations bro. Average is $7.After comms is $5 nett,btohqsg
Yeah not easy to do for bike. But inbetween lala peak hours can try ah no harm,btohqsg
But based on my own stats...end up same rate as LLM per hour üòÇ,btohqsg
Then no point man‚Ä¶.run here and there‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Multi app is good la but have to be careful with picking orders,btohqsg
Idiots book delivery think they book a labour and rent whole car . Say need empty car. Kisiao level very high. They better be clear their space for them is the dimensions of car delivery only. Not even 1m. That is the price they agreed to pay for. Don't come scam llm drivers,btohqsg
Ytd one guy say he want a ride along. I told him he agreed to terms and conditions of llm. But did he pay for his own seats in the app? He shut up. I asked him take a grab instead. These ppl pay what then get what. Don't cb assume free space. Space is most expensive In sg,btohqsg
Car only  but courier... how lah,btohqsg
Do you guys accept if they say they wanna pay extra to seat in the car?,btohqsg
Or do you guys ask them to pay extra? If so how much per head,btohqsg
This one ask them take Grab better. If you‚Äôre stacking their order how? ü§î,btohqsg
Please don‚Äôt spoil the market for other drivers here? Stick to delivering orders only please? ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
You alr going to his location,btohqsg
Might as well take him for the extra $$$,btohqsg
So user can follow if the driver allows,btohqsg
So if user gets stopped by LTA  can blame LLM?,btohqsg
Grab drivers no need earn already ü´§,btohqsg
Sure a lot of lalamove drivers allow passengers,btohqsg
Never be afraid to say NO!And just carry on.If they insist  just say it‚Äôs $25 extra. That‚Äôll put them off.,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAH! Wait until one of them kena caught lor. Then see how they want to cry when car impounded.,btohqsg
Insist that the user become a parcel and sit inside a box then deliver as a box üëç,btohqsg
