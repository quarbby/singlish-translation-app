It different it a sports actually   you can do track   drag race and such activity for event,btohqsg
Yes. And I love watching them. All awesome cars to me man,btohqsg
Actually such is really a sport   just that too many ppl stereotypes as racing lol,btohqsg
I think the plans for this were scrapped due to lack of funds,btohqsg
Is it   hope they try again,btohqsg
no wonder some dont change oils even after one year. bmw also set the interval to one year or 12000km,btohqsg
Yea don't need to especially synthetic,btohqsg
Dino oil needs more frequent change.,btohqsg
the objective is to alwasy ensure moisture is removed.,btohqsg
cold places ok... but sg so freaking hot n start stop traffic... better to change often . oil is cheap,btohqsg
when you run engine you run hot and longer,btohqsg
and if engine is not used for a long time  oil remains okay still.,btohqsg
that is what the video is about. even after one year.,btohqsg
of course when you use it in start stop traffic it is bad for engine.,btohqsg
Thing about engine is that  it requires consistent running as compared to mothball for a long time. Technically EV is able to hibernate for longer period of time and kicks alive when needed.ICE vs EV is much like comparing Ink Jet printers VS Laser printers,btohqsg

There is a serious lack of transparency and monitoring on the prices! When oil prices are Low  consumers don’t get to enjoy citing high operating cost. Therefore  who can verify and trust what oil companies claimed?,btohqsg

Malaysia really heavily subsidized the petrol lol,btohqsg
Our useless garmen only know how to suk money out of us,btohqsg
Actually to be fair our petrol price is not the highest and no reason to subsidize as we got no such resource and very good public transport,btohqsg
Thou I have alot of complaint but I feel like wise,btohqsg
Can work with Brunei lo.Bring in Brunei Petrol station😂👍Bring in Ron 92 lor cheap petrol.Like Malaysia Ron95 subsidies by government.Singapore can import cheaper ron92 from Brunei.Other petrol company can still continue to sell their premium Ron and their technology TechronLater Shell flip table😂 spend so much money at Pilau BukomThen kena potong jalan😂Our exchange rate 1:1,btohqsg

Subsidized fuel is only a part of the population only and not towards the needy   a lot of family got problem meeting end meet with no cars   I think these are the priorities la,btohqsg
Not good for Singapore.Bcos when people go Malaysia for petrol. They also spend alot of money there.Zheng car  solar film  stereo.Dye hairMassageFood.Singapore 80% SME suffers alot.,btohqsg

Actually u be surprised that tesla is more expensive  is in sg content   dealer mark up that much to be more expensive then tesla,btohqsg
u can take bm best ev ix compare with model x and see the price difference,btohqsg
Gotta love statistics and how it can be used cleverly.  Full market view is belowhttps://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/10-takeaways-from-u-s-auto-sales-q1-2022/,btohqsg
Data I share is luxury brand category,btohqsg
tesla is so hot in england it is not possible to order,btohqsg
that why they smart to deisgn model 3 and y  easy to mass prodcue,btohqsg
each factory just produce 1 model,btohqsg
yupp but I wouldn't class tesla as a luxury brand even though most of the cars are priced at that level. With regards to fit and finish  Tesla still has a long way to go,btohqsg
to each it own ba we got a minister driving tesla model 3 and is amazed by it quality,btohqsg
even the base model 3 come with premium fetures like open door button  stalk gear change  premium sound system  ducting aircon  and mechanical lid,btohqsg
cos BMW n Benz got high branded value in Asia. it's mean u made it in life if you drive these. Hearsay Benz is even more exp in Myanmar than sg... only for the super rich,btohqsg
some so call premium made  still using door handle to open the car when they are just putting more light in car to said they are premium,btohqsg
Some things are too practical to remove,btohqsg
Case in point the fella who had to break his window to escape his burning tesla because electrical system dead,btohqsg
everything is just brand . Benz can come out with lousy cars at exorbitant price ppl still buy,btohqsg
it a market and demand thing  if tesla can sell more then bba in pricing  means the quality is there that buyer needed,btohqsg
but some will still said my bba is more expensive and better still  but does not matter hehe,btohqsg
I don't think these are premium as such....button to open door is not premium  side stalk gear shifter has been the norm in American made cars for the longest time and Mercedes cars have them starting from the A class too.,btohqsg
Completely agree  rather than having a button to open the door  would much rather prefer if the can remove panel gaps instead of door handles,btohqsg
panel gaps issue is like nearly non existant for shanghai made model,btohqsg
so far we dont have any members i know got this issue,btohqsg
Also true  brand image is key  its a big reason teslas are selling so much in North America  because they have created a big hype around them  young adults who couldn't care any lesser for the environment or cars buy a model 3 over a c-class or 3 series as their first car more often now due to the hype behind a tesla,btohqsg
How is the interior comparison between tesla and say a BMW 3 series tho?,btohqsg
to me my white seat tesla is way better lol,btohqsg
Depends on what you prefer honestly,btohqsg
u can go to a show room and see the white seats tesla,btohqsg
use a white seat 1 and compare hehe,btohqsg
can spec white or lighter tone seats on a 3 series as well but most spec black in singapore for ease of maintenance,btohqsg
I'll take the giant screen and put it in a bmw cabin for sure 😉,btohqsg
Bmw the knob control feels soooo dated,btohqsg
and so small the 3 series,btohqsg
can choose touchscreen or knob  you can use both,btohqsg
To be fair bmw centre console kind cramps the space up,btohqsg
I'll have lexus interior  bmw road handling and tesla big touchscreen for my frankenstein car then,btohqsg
tesla no transmission can use space,btohqsg
Lexus ES for that price is best passanger car the rear seat is just so spacious,btohqsg
actually  the legroom  shoulder room and hip room is basically the same. The only difference is the headroom by 3 inches. This is primarily because of the extended windshield,btohqsg
I know some of us promote Tesla endlessly and I don’t disagree they are good for what they do. here is the full picture said by the man himself :https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/business-tech%2C-development-and-manufacturing/tesla-could-stop-taking-orders-over-supply,btohqsg
Now even chicken and fish for supply chain issue lol,btohqsg
Even premium chicken at $25.90 for 1 asp hard to get,btohqsg
Mhhmmm. Full picture and how the reality is presented.,btohqsg
Production and supply chain issues to cope just say it as it is by the man.,btohqsg
All companies have supply chain issues but if they cannot deliver  they stop taking orders such as Porsche did as they had to shut down their factories due to wire loom shortages. The others have longer lead times also but they are still able to launch new models and deliver those while some companies have launched a Truck  Sports car and new variants of their sedan and SUV which they are not able to deliver in time and keep pushing year by year,btohqsg
Even tyre is hard to get for t0,btohqsg
But this year the pzero t0 will be available for 20 inch,btohqsg
Globally it is an issue  just that some are coping better  some worse.,btohqsg
I mean... 3 series use as comparison because it is the entry level sedan for bmw,btohqsg
Looks quite spartan compared to even VAG cars,btohqsg
Ya and actually kinda premium to me i especially like the full glass roof,btohqsg
Then aircon is ducting type   my favorite like in hotel,btohqsg
They pretty much reinvented car AC,btohqsg

@winman16@lawryyyyI don’t think there’s any manual EV available in Singapore…,btohqsg
Actually if not for the hoggers on the overtaking lane going parallel with lane 2 and not giving way  no one will need to tailgate 😏,btohqsg
Toyota is developing a way of giving you a manual shifter in an EV and curbing power delivery upon gear changes to make you feel like you are shifting but actually no shifts,btohqsg
Wow so my wild guess is real. In fact I don’t even know,btohqsg
Currently only the Audi e-tron gt and Porsche taycan have multiple gear transmissions with 2 gears,btohqsg
“Feel like shifting but actually no shift”?,btohqsg
All the others are single drive,btohqsg
Yes Taycan has 2 speed box,btohqsg
Soon bmw will do fake exhaust in order to do more sales,btohqsg
There's also a manual gearbox offered by Hyundai and Kia for ICE cars with no clutch. It's known as an iMT and sold in some markets in South Asia and Africa,btohqsg
Hydraulic actuator clutch. Just no pedal,btohqsg
Something like that for the pure ICE cars,btohqsg
Yes cause our speed limit is just too low,btohqsg
"For the mild hybrids a bit different  the mild hybrid implementation is still conceptual and is set to debut in Europe. The pure ICE one is for South Asia and African markets where consumers prefer manual gearboxes for ""efficiency gains"" or familiarity",btohqsg
Even for a low speed limit these jokers can do 70+ barely 80 on a 90kmph expressway,btohqsg
But hor why tail fare just wait for opportunities to overtake will do,btohqsg
Later I show u a video a joker doing 70 at kpe I need filter to 3 rd lane to over take,btohqsg
70 at kpe ok la..I close one eye and let him have it. My record I saw was 60 on MCE lane 1,btohqsg
70 is not ok at all lol,btohqsg
Ok I ask you one question. Say we increase speed limit to 110  the speed limit increases for all 3 lanes yes? So lane 2 drivers also speed up and drive at 100-110 instead of 80-90  yes? So people in lane 1 can still continue to hog at the same speed of 100-100. How will the increase in speed limit solve the issue of road hoggers?(btw I am not against increase of speed limit  all for it),btohqsg
Actually no  the hoggers will continue to hog at 80+ because as quoted they don't feel safe going over 90,btohqsg
Ya I understand your point but I believe that a lot of lane 1 driver at 90 will move to lane 2,btohqsg
As hogger a lot of themThinking is to drive safe so they might not even hit 110,btohqsg
70 is the limit in some sections of kpe  but I do agree  should move out of lane 1 to cruise at 70 or let faster cars pass by,btohqsg
Singaporean are used to driving slow... anything over 100 is dangerous ...,btohqsg
Hoggers mostly drive at government defined speed limit as they think that is the safe speed  the will likely go upto 100/110 still  blindly follow one,btohqsg
That is only a smal stretch and u can drive at 80   the Camara also won’t go off   and 70 all the way is just ridiculous,btohqsg
If step gearbox can be simulated by CVT  it's easy for EV to do the same,btohqsg
"Unpopular opinion from a lady driver which I shall not name. ""When I enter the expressway I go to lane 1 because then only need to watch for traffic on the left"" - her logic is amazing.",btohqsg
just like u ask Ur mlysian fren come sg drive . they will fall asleep,btohqsg
Yes but sure got a portion will move back to lane 2 as they felt comfortable there,btohqsg
Actually a lot of lady driver are better as they will stay at lane 1,btohqsg
I then told her  left most lane also you only need to watch for traffic on the right,btohqsg
Ya now the main hoggers are the commercial vehicles driven by foreigners,btohqsg
Possible  but I feel the issue of hogging will remain even if speed limit is increased. What needs to change is driver mentality and clarification of road rules that lane 1 is overtaking lane  it is not ok to use it and just go at 90 blocking traffic behind.,btohqsg
Yes but increasing speed limit will improve the situation for sure,btohqsg
Sometimes the commercial vehicles understandable because lane 3 is filtering into an exit so they must stay in lane 2 or else they will be forced to take the exit because sadly many road users don't give them way,btohqsg
Now is like ppl driving same speed as Lorry,btohqsg
Now hard to go above speed limit at times on ECP anyway  apart from 11am to 4pm slot or later at night. So much traffic  average speed range becomes 30 to 60 alr,btohqsg
Oh lane 2 I close one eye... They are on lane 1. Those small vans  sometimes box lorries even,btohqsg
Yes cause they think the cars are slower then them HAah,btohqsg
Lane 1 cars really annoying  unless you have some hiace flying down also  in which case it's fine but need to maintain distance in case they slam their brakes,btohqsg
I think because of recent oil price... all driving slower .. so jam at highway these daya,btohqsg
And a lot of sinkie like to block you or accelerate when u change lane,btohqsg
Actually  offices have opened up and tourists making their way back  traffic in general has increased quite a bit,btohqsg
These people not very smart  ICE cars have a gearbox and higher gears are more efficient. Not all the time slow saves fuel,btohqsg
not really . u drive 80 n 100 got difference...,btohqsg
Depends if 80 on gear 5 Vs 100 on gear 7,btohqsg
at 80 will be on highest gear on most auto cars,btohqsg
60 already highest gear in alot of cars,btohqsg
Really depends on gearbox setup of the car,btohqsg
And how the TCU learns your driving patterns,btohqsg
Lol don't think the hoggers really think so much before doing so. To them  slow is safer or they just feel unconfident to go faster but somehow don't want to move because they have the mentality of the car behind can go faster means is speeding,btohqsg
like my boss... he drive only max 80 plus in his honda jazz.  can fall asleep in his car..... but at 80 honda jazz sound proof really cmi😂,btohqsg
My prev boss also goes around there but avoids lane 1 😄 because don't want to block others,btohqsg
I dont like my mild hybrid. Wish it can turn off.But the coasting is good thou. I can coast and even overtake people when its downslope. Rpm Is 0  no engine brake kicks in and the drag is low also  hence lesser resistance,btohqsg
It’s Mr@arnavgulianisir. He is very good. Like Google lens.,btohqsg
Yes this is a decent human being lol,btohqsg
Yeah the bmw in me can’t tell. Hats off to him. He knows well,btohqsg
Not gender related … an idiot is an idiot,btohqsg
He and Mr Xun combined … walking knowledge base,btohqsg
But so far I see road hogger is like 99% males lol,btohqsg
sorry not available  please come back during my working hours,btohqsg
Why are we still talking about hogging.,btohqsg
haha i know very little  still learning from everybody :),btohqsg
… which starts in 18 mins time?,btohqsg
Haha 60% is foreigners driving their company's vehicles 😔,btohqsg
To me most hogger are taxi   old man   act family man  or some high ego ppl driving a slow car but act as if the king of the road,btohqsg
Most disgusting is those that act family man and said oh my god u are speeding   u are endanger me   I got kids in my car .If safety is so important why block ppl in the first place and put themself in a dangerous position,btohqsg
Personally I don't see a big deal in hogging. Just overtake and end of story. If traffic doesn't allow overtaking  then stay safe,btohqsg
They see you floor pedal they tulan you.,btohqsg
Flooring at traffic light also makes people tulan,btohqsg
Drifting at 99 bend also make people tulan,btohqsg
maybe got a even slower driver blocking him in the middle lane😂,btohqsg
Yes in certain sense but some is deliberately block you 1   u want overtake they also accelerate,btohqsg
I met too many of such,btohqsg
Ya.. So if they accelerate then should not be hogging anymore?,btohqsg
Everyone has some bad driving habits which someone else dislike. I also have many bad driving habits  just live and let go lah,btohqsg
I have overtook cars and they flashed high beams at me.I also have cars flashing high beams at me wanting me to give way when I'm driving at 120. There are always such bad drivers around,btohqsg

sometimes its the hoggers that make you kena that redlight when many others cross on green already,btohqsg
previously they are slower than lane 2  you want to overtake they accelerate to be parallel to lane 2. so to answer you  no they are still hogging,btohqsg
Try one week of not flooring pedals and see if others tulan you. I bet not. Things will change. Flooring pedals is not good,btohqsg

maybe newer one should be better,btohqsg
mini so laoya meh... so many gals driving how they tahan,btohqsg
How I know lol maybe is I turbo kick in too much ?,btohqsg
Ok this name suit me more,btohqsg
flooring induces sudden torque and stress the engine. once a while okay  but do it frequently stresses the engine,btohqsg
Oh my no wonder but it just feel too good,btohqsg
that's y it's best to floor borrowed car. not your own,btohqsg
i hardly floor my cars from stationery. but i floored it under load. and in my few hundred thousands of driving the clutch did not require to be changed. NEVER changed clutch actually,btohqsg
protect your engine. do not floor it from rest,btohqsg
instructions unclear  my car now has 6 neutral gears.,btohqsg
You did replace the pistons and rods right?,btohqsg
I felt attacked. But it is true,btohqsg
Sadly only for the US market,btohqsg
Thank you for entertaining vid sir.,btohqsg
Strangely I feel a lot of drivers drive this way in Singapore whether BMW or not,btohqsg
I was given the 1-foot treatment the other day on Lane 1 by a Hiace hahahaha. Traffic wasn’t light at that time.,btohqsg
I think I could see his mole on the left ear.,btohqsg
He should make a video “how to be a Tesla driver”1. Must floor pedal at traffic lights,btohqsg
why tesla driver floor the car?,btohqsg
To try to get to the other side faster than other cars?,btohqsg
I love Why Did The Chicken… jokes!,btohqsg
should be quite scary to floor a Tesla...the pick up speed is no joke for the weak,btohqsg
To make Honda Civic drivers tulan,btohqsg
My heart (and another body part) too weak to floor anything.,btohqsg
I see these so often I just think better to chill. Everyone loses in accidents.,btohqsg
i thought civic driver nowadays are family man  those tiongsters with broom broom 1 are driving coe sirocco  c180  520  a4  a180  or maserati,btohqsg
I thought that's a lexus lol the grille looks like one,btohqsg
the old is also dont like this,btohqsg
Oh ya... the grille looks similar to the lexus F sport grille but the headlights completely wrong,btohqsg
wah you very good sir. mangled already can still tell.,btohqsg
crown meh. crown look very nice leh,btohqsg
could be the old crown... new ones look good,btohqsg
that day I saw another mangled one and i wasn't quite sure what it was until i saw the hanging T badge,btohqsg
Oh... welcome to the grille competition,btohqsg
The latest camry does have some really good looking aftermarket body kits,btohqsg
doesn't look cheesy too even with lexus grille😂,btohqsg
actually quite true re that sir!!  and i have a theory about this. most coe civic owners buy civic because they love the car but as we know  the jdm tax has pushed the car value up so much  the owners don't really find it worth it to risk the body value to go tiong,btohqsg
haha just my sitting on toilet in morning theory,btohqsg
I am an ex civic driver too   v tec kick in yoz,btohqsg
We always said v tec is the best,btohqsg
Then bmw came up with twin scroll turbo   and we still vtec is the best,btohqsg
i believe they are different things sir... a better comparison would be BMW's double VANOS and VTEC i think.,btohqsg

moral of the story: BMW and Mercedes drivers are nice folks who give way to people? 😄,btohqsg
I notice ppl driving expensive car tend to give way   maybe is Their car expensive don’t want ppl bang them or they are just nice ppl,btohqsg
i am tending towards the latter answer.,btohqsg
I guess I am one of the rare BMW driver that has a signal installed and uses it,btohqsg
low self opinion la. need to prove something,btohqsg
ahhh you ordered with the signal pack.  good man!!,btohqsg

This 1 need ask our expert liao there a 2nd hand car experrt here that time tell me carchoice listing are fake,btohqsg
rich ppl buy car to test ... they dun test n buy. a very rich man once told me,btohqsg
meaning: for the employees to drive/ test drive cartoo many miles on it to be sold as new hence sold as used  otherwise fully maintained by company as well,btohqsg
rich people pay $500 for mini s oil change!,btohqsg
I concur. They said what for waste time testing car if the car that you bought is not the same.,btohqsg
Management car..... Used by employees sir or as a demo car. Usually sold between 3k to 10k km of miles before too old,btohqsg
If someone is really rich  they won't buy a car use for a few months and sell  probably understand the concept of depreciation and know how much they will lose on it. This is more of a thing that a pseudo rich person or one who has suddenly come into money will do,btohqsg
Can consider watching this guy to understand if you don't find a real rich person in life,btohqsg
if someone is rich  he doesnt even need to sell the car... just buy another one😂😂,btohqsg
That too  and they tend to take better financial decisions than others anyway,btohqsg

after flooring daily for one year  the motor beaks down and he will change to a new car.,btohqsg
and then floor the pedal he does again. rinse and repeat,btohqsg
it is not just toyota. mazda is incredibly reliable. that is why i drive mazda more than germans,btohqsg
that's y if buy used better buy from elderly...,btohqsg
yes. pity. next owner gets a thrashed motor! and will spend a lot of time and money in workshop,btohqsg
japs keep their cars simple... they dun mess with what's not tested,btohqsg
Reliability is #1 on their mind,btohqsg
Same can be said about koreans,btohqsg
Owner age or profile doesn't matter. Their attention towards the car and love/budget for it does. That's why proper knowledge and PPI is more important than just reading  meticulous owner  etc. Etc.,btohqsg
depends what model... Subaru is reliable...generally,btohqsg
more reliable than a jetta as Mr X mentioned,btohqsg
until one morning you start to wonder why got blue smoke coming out of your exo,btohqsg
May god bless his wallet when paying for Apex seals,btohqsg
what good is a car  however fun it maybe - without reliability,btohqsg
did a Tesla driver here used to be an ex owner😂😂🤣,btohqsg
RX7 RX8 are different. it is a demonstration of their skills in rotary. they know there are many problems. take their regulat mx5. incredibly reliable. mazda is quietly exiting rotary. for the sake of face  they dont annouce big.,btohqsg

yeah. that is why i dont count rotary as a good car. i just compare pstons engined cars. major japanese brands are more or less reliable. actually i have water pump and fan motor replaced in the 4 years of having vios. other than that  the car starts on first crank. never failed!,btohqsg
Point being  all brands have their own share of reliability issues,btohqsg
Mr Xun was talking about piston engined cars,btohqsg
yes. at some point. on balance  got to say they are more reliable than euro.,btohqsg
Apparently there was 25 000+ hp combined from those cars that day,btohqsg

I join car club is go ktv or drink whisky,btohqsg
Then eventually notice every 1 driving different car,btohqsg
i thinkl they are likely ex euro cars owners wantring reliability,btohqsg
the car guys i know all leave their cars at home if they are going drinking,btohqsg
Or cannot buy euro cars 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
i know u like mazda but cannot anyhow shoot statements what,btohqsg
"Sorry a bit rude  but your ""reliability"" stance a bit far already",btohqsg
i got friends who buy mazda cos cheap,btohqsg
Some time no choice use valet and I prefer valet but current car name driver only have to take risk,btohqsg
Arrange a time like 2 am then just proceed to your car,btohqsg
okay find me a euro 7 seater car,btohqsg
you have a perception that euro car is superior?,btohqsg
Euro and Jap cars are not competitors  but are you telling me you will choose a mazda 6 2.5 over a E300/530?,btohqsg
Valet is the best choice! Safe! Or can take taxi too! Always best to be safe,btohqsg
Valet so convenient after work just go happy,btohqsg
We're not saying they're superior Mr X  just saying they aren't as unreliable as you claim they are,btohqsg
i am not saying mazda 6 is lousy because it is VERY GOOD  but in its class.,btohqsg
what do you mean they cannot buy? cannot afford it?,btohqsg
Prices  segments  quality  dynamics  purpose. All very different for contis and Mazdas but all are pretty reliable these days,btohqsg
i met a few who own f10  and japanese cars. one of them just as recently as last month who drives a lexus to change tires and he told me japanese car is so easy to maintain and cheap. his f10 he cant drive it everyday because it breaksdown often and each time it is expensive to maintain.,btohqsg
so are you implying that mazda 6 has less tire wear compare to an F10?,btohqsg
i like subaru a lot but i don’t go around saying subaru owners are ex mazda owners cos more nice looking calm down la bro haha,btohqsg
nobody i spoke to says euro cars is cheap to maintain. almost everyone i came across says japanese cars is a lot better. and coming from me who own both euro cars and japanese i can agree with that 100%,btohqsg
Cheap to maintain and reliable are two very different things sir,btohqsg
ur version of likely is ur friend who own f10 where got objective sia like this,btohqsg
we arent talking abt cheap... reliability,btohqsg
Of course japanese cars cheaper to maintain  more volume  more parts  cheaper cost. Reliability very different,btohqsg
can send me the seller info i wanna go buy now,btohqsg
Have a lot  not same price as cx8,btohqsg
you missed my point. i dont use emotion to say what is factual. although i like bmw for its driving dynamics and driving pleasure  i got to say it is less reliable and more expensive to maintain than japanese,btohqsg
u can fit a 180cm person at the back of a CX8. u can only fit dismembered body parts of a 180cm guy in the back of a GLB,btohqsg
Glb and bmw 2 GT a bit small compared to cx8,btohqsg
CX8 is not cheap and very good  but it is no way gonna rival an X5 or GLE,btohqsg
If your definition of better is cheaper  completely fine. But please don't go around saying only Mazda reliable and euro cars are not reliable because that is honestly not accurate at all,btohqsg
okay wait dont take it out of context. I am not saying CX8 is lousy cos i love it too  but my dear Mr X is comparing it to Euro cars like X5 and GLE,btohqsg
this is a fact. it is not just mazda. it is japanese cars in general - toyota honda nissan are all lkess expensive and easy to maintain than euro cars,btohqsg
from our pov u use emotion a lot actually  can ask the people in the chat,btohqsg
Aiya he meant  a direct conti competitor to cx8 that's 7 seater. Kodiaq fits  good shout! Others different class already,btohqsg
that  many can attest to it,btohqsg
how cani use emotions? i own many euro cars too.,btohqsg
reliability. Out of point. Max 10/40 for this essay. Irrelevant arguements,btohqsg
and i know people who own Mazdas  who say a silent prayer before they try to start the car.,btohqsg
I open another can of worm,btohqsg
Remember I said.Toyota Altis Top 1 car for retiree.Drive slow slow road hogging.Toyota car problems free😂😂😂,btohqsg
you ask me i ask who? how many times here you talk badly about other cars just to prove mazda good haha right not 😄,btohqsg
but.. i don't go out and make sweeping statements,btohqsg
vios is a tank that won’t stop running,btohqsg
^ ah yes sweeping statements is the key word,btohqsg
I own quite a few conti n Asian rides. those that give problems are always conti.Asian cars no problem at all. but I still love conti😂,btohqsg
Have $$$  I also want conti… but I got no $$$,btohqsg
family owned volvo for 20+ years  never broke down once  toyota wish first hand broke down quite a few times after 8 years,btohqsg
why are you so ensitive about euro cars being talked down? i also own euro cars. just accept the opininon from me. if you disagree  it is fine. but no need to say it is emotional. if i were emotional  i would not have owned bmws and alfas in the past,btohqsg
If you're comparing the reliability of an E30 to a modern Mazda 6 then I really clap for you sir! 🫡🫡🫡,btohqsg
no la he comparing is blue E92 hor😬😬,btohqsg
nice  i heard u say u rev at 5000rpm constantly,btohqsg
i have friends driving the e92 m3 and they have not seen a single tow truck for the past 3-4 years,btohqsg
so stop being so emotional. you like your euro cars fine. i also like my m3. but that is besides the point . great driving machine but many faults.,btohqsg
then we have subaru  go from one workshop to another,btohqsg
Ok compare e92 M3 to Mazda 6  I still clap for you,btohqsg
so you want to own a performance car which doesn't really measure anything,btohqsg
that is an outlier. but then again did you also hear of the many who have busted rod bearings?,btohqsg
then i can also ask why you so sensitive when people think you shouldn’t make sweeping statements right haha,btohqsg
go read up what they complained.,btohqsg
All we ask is  make direct comparisons and don't pass sweeping statements. Be open to other brands also lah,btohqsg
no leh my family own 1 never break down how does that work? 😛,btohqsg
pray research and share with us the public data on number of cars in the e92 m3 population which actually had recorded busted rod bearings,btohqsg
just believe what you want to believe,btohqsg
I'm actually on x side 😂,btohqsg
i know you guys are euro car guys,btohqsg
Well actually we are more concerned for the community because some might read and believe your statements and be misguided,btohqsg
Seem like one started and the rest smelled blood regardless of topic,btohqsg
Provide recall statistics also you don't want to see,btohqsg
i have heard a lot of owners change out rod bearings pre-emptively because of the worry,btohqsg
no leh we love all cars but sometimes cannot say some sweeping statements  this chat got a lot of owners ma  can trigger some haha,btohqsg
how much is a set of rod bearings?,btohqsg
I love mitsuoka. hunting for 1😂,btohqsg
not true. not premetive. many failed,btohqsg
it’s how we won’t go say mazda bad here and there ykwim haha cos we respect others cars also,btohqsg
i like cars that explodes thats why i choose subaru,btohqsg
I wish they bring chery back to sg,btohqsg
isn’t vertex still here? no ah?,btohqsg
Amazing coach work that brand! We are not euro guys  we are car guys who love all cars  but believe in facts!,btohqsg
haha can try import  idt the owners in sg wanna sell,btohqsg
The mitsuoka dealer at AML still around I think  selling the rockstar,btohqsg
So much beautiful than Mazada 6 Wagon. 😝 Honda Accord Tourer. Sound even better 😂,btohqsg
how would you know? my friends change in advance too! and it works leh,btohqsg
that shows you are kinda naive,btohqsg
taking precautions is naive? like that then don’t wear seatbelt la,btohqsg
eh can you add in your opinion? cos later Mr X say you wrong then you rebutt by sayings its ur opinion,btohqsg
what in your opinion is the actual percentage?,btohqsg
don’t need buy motor insurance also like that,btohqsg
a LOT. it is a known problem.,btohqsg
how many owners take the effort to properly warm up the car before whacking the engine?,btohqsg
NONE. it is a known problem.,btohqsg
ok. that's halfway through the model life,btohqsg
anyway  i dont think you want to acknowledge the existence of such problem. choose what you want to believe.,btohqsg
if you think your euro car is very reliable than it is,btohqsg
nowhere has anyone said it is not a problem.,btohqsg
but it isnt as bad as you think,btohqsg
We are happy to acknowledge should you provide us facts not statements here and there,btohqsg
and no need to over react.,btohqsg
Bad. Not like Wish. Different engine and ratio.,btohqsg
Yes! That's what my teachers many years back in school taught me as well Me Xun!,btohqsg
Beautiful  time moves but facts remain constant 😎😎,btohqsg
Drove this before. People kept telling me it look like Subaru Legacy😂👍,btohqsg
how is this car ah  got enough power anot,btohqsg
i quite like it leh haha,btohqsg
