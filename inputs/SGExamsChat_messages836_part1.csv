Oh ok that leads to the next issue,btohqsg
sorry u don't give NA vibes to me hence my assumption,btohqsg
Bro i looking at ite coursefinder and the worst course that shows up for emb3 is like 14 points,btohqsg
Theres no way someone with like 18 points cant get into ite so like wtf,btohqsg
you looking at higher nitec or nitec,btohqsg
The filter doesnt show the option,btohqsg
if you're looking at the more popular or niche options in ite courses to select for whatever you do after N level result day (i forgot what u call option day for secondary students looking to get into poly or ite after they finish their national exams),btohqsg
it's definitely unlikely to get into such courses with a mere 18 point aggregate,btohqsg
my brother also scored about 18 EMB3 for his prelims without even factoring his o level subjects which don't get released at the same time,btohqsg
so we worked on just what we have,btohqsg
Bro but like 18 isnt even a fail for NA level,btohqsg
And absolutely 0 courses show up,btohqsg
according to the course finder or course booklet,btohqsg
the finder isn't as accurate as the booklet given to you,btohqsg
don't look at the course finder on MOE's website,btohqsg
it's not even as updated as the one on ITE's official course finder website,btohqsg
So the website is just shit la,btohqsg
i mean i use the normal ite website,btohqsg
Ehh the ite website got no score filters tho,btohqsg
I think the moe website only show higher nitec courses thats y,btohqsg
you go to a course you want  not go to a course that is easiest to enter,btohqsg
Just filtering elmab3 and na level without typing in any score will only show 18 results,btohqsg
no point go to a course that you can easily enter but spend 2 yrs not liking what you are doing,btohqsg
moe & official school websites will definitely have different filtering systems,btohqsg

r even year papers easier than odd year papers,btohqsg
Tbh i have no clue but all i rmb is 2019 paper 2 math was excessive worded(non-numerical) explain answers,btohqsg
ermmm i think there's theories about that circulating before but it's usually shut down due to the baseless reasoning if it's an actual speculation discussion on the likelihood of itfor national exams (not just a levels bah)  a lot of students in the odd years feel like it's a lot tougher than the even year papers,btohqsg
like for some reason the odd years always have some kind of surprise topics for most of the subjects..,btohqsg
hi guys does anyone by any chance have the n level amath paper one?,btohqsg
Same thing every year  people are publicly asking for the paper immediately after a national exams.The newer members won't know that one person was sent a warning letter by SEAB few years ago for sharing some papers on this chat after the exams.Maybe should add into the rules or pin a message not to ask for papers of national exams immediately after the paper.,btohqsg
Sorry but how do they get access to those papers? Isn't it illegal?,btohqsg
wasn't there a rule made on the r/sgexams reddit about sharing the whole of national examination paper? maybe it's fine to implement across the other sgexam platforms as well,btohqsg
