"🌻PIka World Breakfast Date - 13 June 2023🌻The equity market continued to climb  with the S&P 500 finishing at its 52-Week high.Investors are growing confident that the Fed will likely pause on its interest rate during tomorrow's FOMC meeting. They also expect tonight's CPI data to show progress in easing inflation.🎙Inflation Expectation.📖When the data hit the wire  economists are looking at a 4.1% rise in CPI on a yearly basis which will be a dip from 4.9% during the prior comparable period.It will mark another golden step towards a gradual weakening of inflation. Unless the figure shows a surprise upside  a rate pause is likely.🥁Americans are hopeful of easing inflation.🗽Indeed  a survey by the New York Fed showed that consumers expect inflation within a. year to decline meaningfully to 4.1% in May  which is seen as the lowest level in two years.This is a finding from its Survey of Consumer Expectations held monthly. The April's reading was 4.45%. It is critical to build on this momentum as we welcome decent CPI data tonight.📮What's on the menu today?🎯1) 8.30 pm: CPI data will be released to compare MoM to YoY growth/decline.It is 13 June  Tuesday  8.55 am in Singapore and 8.55 pm in New York.🎢Markets' sentiment and trading pyschology🎲The market is highly bullish going into the big economic data week. We had been expecting a choppy and ranging day  and the late swing up in the equity market had shown strength.So why do we close it? Emotionally it will be painful for me to take a loss since traders often encounter this ""loss-aversion bias"". However  looking back  it has become crucial in this ever-rising market to take chips off the table when the trades turn sour  as we had shared in our trading channel.As such  we took profit off our long positions while closing our more significant short positions. Due to our considerably long positions  we managed to limit our losses and maintain a profit for our primary and sub-account for this month. So reviewing your trading journal and identifying your best-performing trading patterns is essential.We slowly migrated some of our main IBKR account fund to our sub-account (which we created recently) to better split our trading from investment. If we can see suitable trading structures after the CPI release  we will try to limit our exposure  given Wednesday's FOMC day can be anyone's guess.Join us in our trading channel as we share everything on the market development.And with that  we wish all friends a fruitful day in the office and friends on holiday too!See you guys tonight at the CPI's release! 🫕🍝🥛",btohqsg
