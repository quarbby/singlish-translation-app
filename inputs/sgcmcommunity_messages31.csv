Only in Japan  baggage handlers take care of your baggage unlike the rest of the world. 😅,btohqsg
There are tons of cross promotion trains and air planes. Especially with Pokemon.,btohqsg
Thru my airplane window. I was at Sapporo then.,btohqsg
Ah yes. I was with an ANA group airplane.,btohqsg
The thing about japanese is  they really respect each other. Even cleaners take pride in their job and were respected like any other professions.Being in Japan really feels that you are not on the same planet. 🤣,btohqsg
I have bad experience during Honey Moon at Hokkaido..The airport bus service to Hakodate.They treat every Chinese   thinking from China. Not allowed to put luggage in to the baggage storage of the bus.Asked to drag up the bus but all Japanese can put their luggage at the storage trunck.Ask you to point your flag at New Chitose Airport. Can't understand basic English. Got unhappy after asking 2nd time to confirm the bus route to Volcano 🌋 attraction.Their politeness are all ACT base on their job.Not genuine friendly 😂I feel that Thai's  Indonesian  are genuine friendly.,btohqsg
Sorry to hear that. Maybe I had advantage since I can speak some japanese. (And some say I look and blend like them),btohqsg
But there are some caveat about japanese. They are so polite that you can't really tell if they are REALLY being polite  or just being professional 😅,btohqsg
They are Xenophobic but not as vocal as Singaporeans 😂👍,btohqsg
I was treated so nicely there,btohqsg
Yes bro u don look like chinaman,btohqsg
Ya must be able to speak fluent Japanese. To remove the xenophobic barrier.I see alot of China folk living in Japan. They speaks fluent Japanese.Blending in very well.Run business  hiring Japanese worker.Japanese wife.,btohqsg
They want to kill chinamen i think,btohqsg

This. Usually we refer to northern Chinese.,btohqsg
I believe the mainland Chinese are better educated now. Not as crazy rowdy as last time.,btohqsg
big population size  so black sheep also more... just like people stereotyping bmw drivers,btohqsg
I may have spoken too soon. The recent viral video about man bulling ladies  Japanese hated those barbarians,btohqsg
Depend on state.Shanghai same as Singaporeans.Recently the northern China of 唐山。9 men best up two women at midnight Hot Pot restaurant.Now police deploy SWAT patrolling. HotPot restaurant.,btohqsg

Aye yo chill t’was a joke,btohqsg
He is lane splitting and travelling too fast in that pace of traffic.,btohqsg
Chill  he was joking. HahahahaCos I ended his flowery dreams of kawaii japanese girls last night. 🥲,btohqsg
I also Lane split.Traffic Police also lane split.Have to be very defensive riding. Look into the rear view window. See where the driver looking. Chit chatting?  Kept turning head and Looking left  look at side mirror.That is why rear window can only be 70% tinted and unblock like Van.Look at the front wheel. A slight turn on the steering wheel is obvious on the wheel.So can predict the movement of the driver.Ah Ga Ah Ga， can know the driver is impatient and the wanna lane change out ,btohqsg
Many lane split  what mainly caused the over reaction is that he is travelling too fast while lane splitting.,btohqsg
Like u said  that isn't defensive riding.,btohqsg
Given a benefit of doubt  Mazda driver did signal his intend to lane change.,btohqsg

If you maintain the pace of the traffic even if you are lane splitting  that will not happen. Most biker speed up when lane splitting  which increases the risk of such incident from happening.,btohqsg

New one is a mild hybrid,btohqsg
I know Mazda 3 have Hybrid model. Battery + petrolAnd diesel model.I'm confused. Mild Hybrid has battery and electric motor?,btohqsg
as the name suggests  the Mazda 3 is a mild hybrid. A small lithium-ion battery drives a motor generator that produces extra torque and power. This is primarily used to help the car accelerate slightly more quickly from a standstill. However  note that the Mazda is not a pure hybrid car (like a Toyota Prius)  and it is unable to run on battery power alone.,btohqsg
too small power for the body,btohqsg
this is not good enough. my dec 2015 mazda 6 2.5 can do 13 km a liter average,btohqsg

you must never buy car of differentr color than factory original. the inside is impossible to change. do you trust others take out the stuff to spray the color?,btohqsg
For me it really depends on where it was resprayed  some shops really do it well  even better than the manufacturer/dealership at times,btohqsg
are they going to remove the components inside engine compartments to spray paint?,btohqsg
How to prepare your car for wet weatherAmong all  having a good set of tyres or tyres in optimal condition is the most important during wet weather!👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you agree!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
Oh no  not an engine out paintjob,btohqsg
that is for exterior color. when i did the restoration  the exterior is sprayed with fantastic paint job. better than original.,btohqsg
For those  I don't think there's any shop in Singapore that can do it really well,btohqsg
In other parts of the world there are great shops out there like chartwell in the UK  etc.,btohqsg
but never the inside. i would never allow that to happen. this painter actually remved the fusebox in order to paint it. btu when he put it back he did not fasten the wires properly resulting in melted relays!,btohqsg
They're even approved by manufacturers for bodyshop repairs,btohqsg
took me a long time to figure out why,btohqsg
so how are they going to spray the inside without taking out the stuff in engine bay?,btohqsg
supposed you wanna change color from white to red. how would it look?,btohqsg
They don't spray the inside that's the issue,btohqsg
Or if they do  not a great job,btohqsg
Which brings me back to  the key thing is who resprayed it,btohqsg
how can they not spray the inside if you change color? spraying outside would look weird,btohqsg
nothing to do with who. letting them dismantle and reassemble back is high risk,btohqsg
They spray the doors and the door jambs and boot jambs but not the engine bay,btohqsg
Haha i was thinking like respraying a less popular? Silver colour with another stock colour like blue or something hence just wondering if dealer will rip off based on respray,btohqsg
Yes it is  that's why you need a good shop who knows what they're doing,btohqsg
"Do what you feel you would like to see. End of the day  it's your car that you see everyday and you should be happy with its looks. If you are looking at reselling your car soon then best to keep it stock  otherwise no point in looking at it's ""resale value"" to do anything cosmetic for the long run.",btohqsg
if everything based on logic and being prudent.. nobody owns a car liao haha,btohqsg
If you buy a property  thinking of reselling it years down the road  it doesn't mean you wouldn't do a renovation and have built in furniture or carpentry because you may sell it next time isnt it. You use your car on a daily  it should be something that you would look back when you park and know you like how it looks. Be it a respray  a wrap or whatever you add on to it  as long as you like it!,btohqsg
I just met a flash flood. While my car drives pass it  it started to vibrate badly and have that choke up effect. Any experts experience it before,btohqsg
Water went into air intake.Pray never going into engine😱,btohqsg
Update to shareFinally went to workshop this morning. Mechanic suspect throttle body and air flow sensor. Cleaned both and rpm stable at about 800. Let's see for next 2 weeks as fault does not come always,btohqsg
You open and check your air filter. Is it wet?Try let the engine dry up. Don't drive 1-2day maybe?,btohqsg
Thanks. I manage to reach the service Center for a check.,btohqsg
How deep was e flash flood,btohqsg
I didn’t look out cause my car was vibrating badly n I was focusing on high beaming the car in front to ask him to drive faster 😅,btohqsg
what car is it? i escaped flash floods many times. lucky. if water enters into your exhaust  it can cause hesitation. revv high to blast off prevent water from entering,btohqsg
Ya. I always thought need to revv high to blast off water. But the kuku driver in front is like cruising my through. Haha,btohqsg
this is where manual car becomes useful in this situation,btohqsg
Don't auto cars also have low gear function?,btohqsg
P R N D 2 usually the 2 is use a higher gear ratio for climing slopes,btohqsg
In conti cars is S for sports mode  which changes gear change rev,btohqsg
Can manually shift into a lower gear,btohqsg
Usually have either L or 2 and 1,btohqsg
Or manual shifts using gear lever or paddles,btohqsg
in 2006 i have floods chasing me i drive as fast as i can in segamat,btohqsg
But singaporeans have barely any knowledge about driving in flood,btohqsg
Most never experience it in their lifetime as drivers,btohqsg
be vigilant man. stay on high alerts do not get trapped. once trapped no way out. hard ot get out,btohqsg
just last year i almost got trapped. fortunately i was driving a toiyota vios where it's quite high. i had to go through floods.,btohqsg
if i were in m3  die,btohqsg
this is how you do car tests. myvy scores,btohqsg

oh no. that reflects badly on mazda.,btohqsg
going to the showrooms during the weekends again,btohqsg

Small engine la. Car body is big. Go for the top end 2 liter,btohqsg
You’re volvo jx. No ordinary driver.,btohqsg
Same mama earth and petrol go for small litre,btohqsg
High fuel prices will pass. But you’ll be stuck with a small engined car everyday that you may not like it. Think long term. If you can afford a Mazda 3 go for the high end one.,btohqsg
That 1.5 liter engine is best matched with Mazda 2,btohqsg
Lol but even the astina is 1.5  the 2.5 with the mazda3 body would be good 😉,btohqsg
Because you’re gonna use it everyday. Be sure to have the one you like. And they’ll smile to compensate for the rising fuel price. 🤭,btohqsg
Yes  if you don't enjoy what you are driving that means should change car 😂,btohqsg
If you got a 1.5 and the rising fuel price makes you feel even more tu lan when you feel you made a mistake buying a small engined car. This ain’t a turbo.,btohqsg
this one your territory tell me one,btohqsg
1.5 Astina for both hatchback and sedan,btohqsg
okay la i quite like it  1 step down is elegance,btohqsg
I’ve the highest variant 2.5 Mazda 6. Yet I don’t use all the features,btohqsg
Upto one's personal preference  that's why they offer the different trim levels,btohqsg
I know a friend who's relative ordered a Kia cerato with fabric seats  no sunroof  no touchscreen,btohqsg
Well if you don’t mind the lower power,btohqsg
That’s what a wise decision is. He knows what he wants.,btohqsg
For me I chose the 2.5 because it’s more powerful and it’s all the important safety features. Also sunroof. Although this is not main draw. I hardly use,btohqsg
How can you not love the looks,btohqsg
sunroof is good  drive through the CBD at night and wow... u will fall in love,btohqsg
Still nice to have  even if you don't open the sunroof itself  can open the sunroof blind for some natural light to come in,btohqsg
In any color it’s a beauty,btohqsg
If only we got the new turbo variant in Singapore,btohqsg
Actually the more I look the more Mazda look like tesla,btohqsg
Ok I see many are now sold. Mazda,btohqsg
The back view is very similar,btohqsg
America and Australia sells only 2.0 and 2.5 litre version of Mazda 3. Previous Mazda 3 here had 2.0 litre SP / Sport. Unless someone PI current 2.0/2.5L.,btohqsg
If one is in that price bracket  it is an easy recommendation,btohqsg
correct  learning to road hog from Mr Road Hogger himself,btohqsg
Not at the current price but as the prices go up  they go up for the competitors as well,btohqsg
expensive lor  machine price can match mazda 6 already,btohqsg
Go for this jx volvo. No regrets. Makes heads turn,btohqsg
Lol just don't do that on the overtaking lane can already,btohqsg
I’d say more gorgeous than your volvo,btohqsg
i do that on all lanes  make sure everybody stuck behind me. I weave across 4 lanes along CTE to warm up my tyres,btohqsg
Mazda is a small company and they’re detailed oriented,btohqsg
Need to drive those mega truck to block all 4 lanes,btohqsg
My Volvo is here to stay though  its between Mazda 3 and Jazz,btohqsg
You drive this you block that floor-pedalTesla driver la.,btohqsg
Hold him in the fast lane,btohqsg
Please la. Honda jazz? No Honda here. Can’t even come close in terms of style and looks,btohqsg
cheap abang... the car only here for 2 years,btohqsg
2 years later when coe go down will change again,btohqsg
Cheap ain’t good. Buy a car you love.,btohqsg
honda is QUITE decent too leh,btohqsg
Honda is a good car no question. Just not stylish,btohqsg
you just wait for Julian's FD2R to come out on SGCM... video was filmed today😉😉,btohqsg
I don’t question Japanese cars like Nissan Toyota Honda in reliabilities. But car is more than just utilities,btohqsg
The new fit look so cute,btohqsg
And the new civic also look prettier,btohqsg
Old vezel looks good. New one errrrr,btohqsg

New civic looks good but I rather go for accord,btohqsg
YET in the jazz i could fit😂😂,btohqsg
oh i saw the civic 1.5T w the bodykit and SSR rims  looks splendid,btohqsg
That's y I said not good,btohqsg

Good excuse not to fecth ppl,btohqsg

Suzuki sport is uncomfortable. For long distance,btohqsg
New one mana so cheap tang kuku,btohqsg
Stick with Mazda. Comfortable and stylish,btohqsg
Forget the test. You’ll get confused,btohqsg
They said jazz bigger a little no ?,btohqsg
Buy jazz means buy Hybrid which is highest spec,btohqsg
Mazda no resale value. Very low ARF.😂,btohqsg
i cfm put a big tick on that box,btohqsg
obviously i wont la😂😂 $2000 for a spoiler and a badge😂😂😂😂,btohqsg
Spoiler is really redundant or fender,btohqsg
Add weight   and hard to wash car,btohqsg
When I wash car I always been irritated by the fender,btohqsg
i did spoiler in jb  RM 500 only,btohqsg
you dont buy a car because of resale. then you should pick toyota,btohqsg
He wanna sell in 2-3 yrs😅,btohqsg
if you are the type who enjoys driving  then dont look for resale. this is secondary factor. not primary considerations.,btohqsg
that is why i buy second hand mazda. it really is besty value for money. high quality and low priced,btohqsg
Toyota drive is so wood...  alot of car drive better. even Korean cars drive better,btohqsg
Althought Subaru also CVT but doesn't feel like one,btohqsg
CVT sucks ... very boring to drive . no feel,btohqsg
toyota  accoridng to germans  is a kitchen appliance car. boring but reliable,btohqsg
i bought a Subaru AWD  i like it  however lose to Audi,btohqsg
It’s a phv car. High chance to get flagged down,btohqsg
I try not to buy car that r often used as phv,btohqsg
what models of mazda are used,btohqsg
you dont even know the models,btohqsg
boss car mazda 6 is never used right,btohqsg
911 interior and intrument cluster is beautiful,btohqsg
yeah. car is BIG. and long,btohqsg
bigger and longger than my m3,btohqsg
got to be carefuyl when going up ramps of malls parking,btohqsg
IMO  In terms of interior cabin leg room  a little more compromised than competitors' models within the same segmentThough exterior dimensions are similar...,btohqsg
the seats are firm  sort of like german kind of hard and firm,btohqsg
didnt feel that the leg room was particularly big,btohqsg
cant compare to camry and accord,btohqsg
But the price is significantly lower than these two,btohqsg
Mazda 3 and 6 look the same. ppl see may still flag down,btohqsg
nobody ever flagged my car after 6 months,btohqsg
Yes.Camrynow ~199k  century sprint 8.5 sec + good FCAccordnow ~215k  century sprint 9.1 sec + cheap road taxMazda6 2.0 now ~166k  century sprint 10.8 sec + worse FC than camry & more expensive road tax than AccordMaybe that 30 - 50k savings from Mz6 can offset the FC + road tax over 10 years? Can see in that way,btohqsg
how good is toyota camry fuel economy,btohqsg
I remember maz 6 just slightly more than 100k in 2019,btohqsg
But y u want to pay more for a car that look like mazda 3 n make ppl think it’s phv car?,btohqsg
i pay what a good value car is,btohqsg
it is the best among the japanese and many euros,btohqsg
can toyota better my fuel consumption which averages 13km a liter combined city higheays,btohqsg
Not sure as I don't drive that/hybrid cars.On paper shows ~ 22-24km/l. Maybe realistically 18-20km/l?,btohqsg
Hahaha yes I remember too. Those good old days.C180 was like 160k 170k?,btohqsg
my friend has a prius. he can get more than 18,btohqsg
Bro u can buy the cheaper Mazda 3 n put phv decal to earn money. Isn’t it better,btohqsg
they dont sell gas cars anymore?,btohqsg
Don't think so for 2022 models at least,btohqsg
2019 - 2021 still have non hybridOn paper ~15km/l .. Actual maybe 12-13? hahah big engine 2-2.5L,btohqsg
yes. even my ex toyota vios best is 15 km h on highwsays. but combined it is 13.5 at leastr,btohqsg
vios is 1.5 liter engine. my mazda 6 2.5 delivers average 13,btohqsg
Cannot be. I think u miscount,btohqsg
"Altis aso another very ""wood"" car.",btohqsg
the best i ever tried is 15 that is when i drive real slow never exceed 100,btohqsg
but so many ppl buy altis,btohqsg
Mazda 6 most likely 1 litre 8km,btohqsg
same la. all the same bigger or smaller version iof the same appliance,btohqsg
Machiam like sports car fc but no sports car functions,btohqsg
got a fren bought the MG SUV. $9x k,btohqsg
My fren say it’s a very boring car,btohqsg

Toyota is for budget drivers. Mostly uncles.,btohqsg
75yo uncles with their GR Supra😅😅,btohqsg
GRS200 is a lovely car  would love to own one if fuel wasnt so expensive,btohqsg
Ya maintenance free for budget peeps,btohqsg
this is bad economy. something is wrong with your car,btohqsg
Fuss and frills free car mah 😅 The face-lift altis now looks better + interior quite spacious sia.I once borrowed a friend's for a few days. I think can attain 15km/l,btohqsg
Honestly Mazda can be the same but very little in SG,btohqsg
when you have so many of one type of cars  the parts tend to be cheaper hence maint also cheaper,btohqsg
thatsnwhy toyota honda etc all the parts so cheap,btohqsg
Lexus also. Make the looks abit more classy only. Engine still Toyota.,btohqsg

But for cat A car  I still stick by Mazda 3 🤓,btohqsg
So far nobody flag my Mazda 3 yet (but previous vezel yes 😢),btohqsg
Wah redline still 12.28km/l.Insane good FC for your 2L engine,btohqsg
i think the fuel saving is due partially to istop,btohqsg
my car is mazda 6 2.5 top of the range model. loves the many features in there.,btohqsg
Nice. The last time I drove a 2.5L moderately gently also can't smell 9km/l 😅Redline don't know maybe not even 8,btohqsg
that redline of course i didnt do long. it's a test for a fe mins only. did you use istop?,btohqsg
i rev abit my fc increase alot,btohqsg
tryna live laugh love through the high fuel prices but lately it has been hard,btohqsg
i noticed the revv hardly exceeds 3000,btohqsg
at 2400  it is already 120kmh,btohqsg
so alwasy stays at low  rpm,btohqsg
but ii spend most time on highway on balance,btohqsg
Volvo 130kmh about 1.8k on 8th gear,btohqsg
what is high? that is what it is the skyactiv gearbox,btohqsg
wanna know my m3? it is 3000 rpm at 120,btohqsg
honestly thats abit high dont you think,btohqsg
no no. not gearing. well you are partially correct. it is at this hear because the engine has the torque to pull it,btohqsg
"it depends how how the engine is tuned. in order to do better fuel economy  revv as low as possible while still able to give the ""pull""",btohqsg
no la. that is why i only use it once a week to maintain the car,btohqsg
it is wallet breaking fuel consumption.,btohqsg
if i put a small engine to haul your sx90  it definitely wont be able to cruise at 1800 rpm in 8th gear. no torque,btohqsg
XC90 use same engine as mine leh,btohqsg
xc is suv  S is sedan,btohqsg
your engine is turbo. high torque  so low rpm,btohqsg
honestly turbo/non turbo   we are able to afford and enjoy the car is what matters most,btohqsg
who cares what other ppl think of your car hor  who paying for the car anyways,btohqsg
funny why after geely took over volvo changed a lot,btohqsg
did geely fire the old designers,btohqsg
its good change in my opinion,btohqsg
suddenly all the old fashioned coffin looking cars are gone,btohqsg
we all have to move forward and change somehow,btohqsg
the change in volvo is like the change in mercedes benz. suddenly so stylish and trendy,btohqsg
i believe its still the same designers but under ford  there was alot of cost saving involved,btohqsg
i wish bmw is like that,btohqsg
last time it cannot rival cars like the germans  now its very much closer.,btohqsg
cant say much for singapore because wearnes take a huge chunk which neutralise the price advantage volvo had,btohqsg
haha different strokes for different folks,btohqsg
personally hated it at first but its growing on me,btohqsg
even my bmw salesmen say the same,btohqsg
they cant tell the different models from front,btohqsg
bmw is still better as a driver's car,btohqsg
even bmw salespeople told me they dont like the styling...,btohqsg
you are confused between styling and driving dynamics.,btohqsg
bmw is a enjoyable car to drive no doubt.  but style? nein,btohqsg
yeah no i get what you mean haha,btohqsg
