OxPay ordered to pay ex-CEO  ex-CFO for wrongful dismissalhttps://ift.tt/c5wzP3iSeptember 19  2022 at 09:22PM,btohqsg
Oxpay have been on a downtrend ever since the board room tussle saga and perhaps this fight being one of the reason.Now that there is closure  and they rather not pursue legal action and just move on from here   I guess that’s the best cause of action.Let’s see how they pan out from here. 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼Chart wise  looks to be building a bottom to reverse upwards.PS: They are in Fintech and yesterday DPM made some forays and collabs with India into Fintech too. Hoping some possible catalyst and play to bring this one up.(Reference below 👇),btohqsg
"MAS and Indian regulator to collaborate on fintech innovationsDeputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong said this wilI ""spur innovation  create new jobs and investments  and further strengthen the development of the fintech industry in both Gujarat and Singapore.”https://bt.sg/wAjj",btohqsg
Chart wise  seems to have bottomed out and form a base considering no one sees any incentive throwing shares outs at current price .Confirmation of the downtrend reversal would be when they break out of the $0.142 with volumeSeems pretty close as they closed $0.141 today. Could be pretty soon considering Govt added focus on fintech with the India collab and that the recent trend has been bottomed out illiquid counters  Oxpay Financial does have quite a good fighting chance 👍Meantime  watchlist and come in on the BO as it should get fast and furious. 20-30 pips run type not impossible at all as it is illiquid and light,btohqsg
Lol you still have car to drive .. not bad,btohqsg
P plate jialet Liao .. claim until his pant drop . Lolz,btohqsg
wall st green ... hope all pennies chiong tomolo,btohqsg
Just a constant reminder to all and to self.Once the major uptrend line breaks for a popular counter that was recently in play  do not hesitate to cut and take the loss.It might not be easy to do as we prefer to hope and pray 🙏🏻 but most times it will be futile and if we choose not to stop loss and hold it   many a times the losses will only get bigger.Tough but necessary  Hustlepeople as this is an opportunity cost and a reason why there are lesser players in SGX these days.Above 2 charts of parkson and accrelist for illustration and study purposes.Good night.,btohqsg

I think 1% is factored in Liao,btohqsg
0.75 too slow to meet Fed target 2% inflation,btohqsg
Yea bro@benjapohwe all been there and also get caught still some times as we cling on to hope. Discipline is key because 99% when a uptrend line breaks with some volume  it’s gonna tank further .To me  Stop Loss is the most important because in 2020 many dabbled in glove and mask counters as it ran big and they saw earlier players make good money on this .I believe for Medtecs many are still hanging on to $1+ counter which possibly will never get back there.The moment they broke  have to cut means have to cut if not a $150k investment in Medtecs would only be worth $13k now,btohqsg
The BBs smart . They know which one retailers going to go for so they dare pump up crazy high because they know they can dump successfully,btohqsg
This also smelly. Pump from 0.014 in dec 2020 to 0.173 in jan 2021. Then bleed all the way. Smart bbs.,btohqsg
Whats unusual for the place is there was no bad news to cause its drop. Just pure pump and dump.,btohqsg
In fact  they had some good news collaboration too with smrt etc.Anyways any stocks that ran up like that   need to put SL when playing otherwise losses Mount,btohqsg
This week should have one. Spotted one but cannot talk about it as it will only slow the progress,btohqsg
Yes! Even worse threw out some garbage to draw more retailers in. End of the day need to see financials and numbers.,btohqsg
