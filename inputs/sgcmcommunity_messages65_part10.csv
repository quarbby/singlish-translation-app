freaking love german cars of that era,btohqsg
these two totally trumped the rs4,btohqsg
the facelift one makes such a big difference too hahaha,btohqsg
I have seen more cls63 than c63,btohqsg
Audi is like the sensible older brother. But tides have seemed to turn now,btohqsg
cls63 is a work of art too,btohqsg
the AMG55s made the 63s look great too cos they carried such a good legacy,btohqsg
same haha but the unicorn must have some reliability too,btohqsg
Amg cars have always been outrageous in their own way,btohqsg
I was surprised they kept the 4.0 v8 for the w205,btohqsg
still has its charm la  but i‚Äôd rather get a giulia qv over the w205,btohqsg
Subjective. I'll take a risk on a carrera gt even if it tries to kill me,btohqsg
i‚Äôd take a risk on a e60 m5 because it‚Äôs really such a unicorn,btohqsg
Especially with a good oem + set of wheels and ohlins. Obsessed garage spec,btohqsg
oem+ is the way to go,btohqsg
Wah smg. U approaching a dark zone,btohqsg
those who haven‚Äôt heard the ‚Äòferrari‚Äô engine in the qv really should,btohqsg
Maybe only the alfa selespeed tops it,btohqsg
a good akra would cut it for me anyday hahahaha,btohqsg
Wah saab is my blindspot. I know nothing about them,btohqsg
i only know about their gearbox watching the top gear tributes,btohqsg
So many great cars and brands that died or barely thrive because of low sales,btohqsg
But top gear brought them all to us,btohqsg
who makes the strongest and best selling gearbox,btohqsg
I‚Äôve seen a c63 wagon on the roads. Beautiful.,btohqsg
not a fan of audis but the older avants are really nice too,btohqsg
who uses toyota gearbox other than toyota,btohqsg

Confirm Toyota üòÇPHVs 300 000km 3yr oldDaily 12hr driving.After 300 000 ABS/ break pump spoil. Because never flush brake fluidüòÖ,btohqsg
CVTs dont count. just auto gearboxes and DSG,btohqsg

Porsche 8 speed tiptronic is toyota gearbox,btohqsg
ah yes the virtual gears very annoying,btohqsg
i think my car would be 10x better without cvt,btohqsg
mazda and lotus used to use aisin,btohqsg
TOYOTA BEST CAR IN THE WORLD,btohqsg
lexus also use Aisin  in their LFA,btohqsg
aisin is since the 1980 or 70s,btohqsg
used in cars like yaris too,btohqsg
Toyota CVT is rated to go without overhaul requirements for 600k km if driven under optimal conditions and maintained as per the manual where as the ZFs are rated for 500k km,btohqsg

Giulia QV is fantastic. Can only speak for the ‚Äò21 model but very reliable  fast and versatile. Can be quiet smooth daily runner or beast depending on mood,btohqsg
Sings very nicely esp above 4K rpm,btohqsg
Nice abt rims. Cant say the same about the amg side skirt sticker thats even in the wrong direction.,btohqsg
Wait till u see the sticker on the windscreen haha,btohqsg
