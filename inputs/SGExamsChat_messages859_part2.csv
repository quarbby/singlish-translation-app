It's not a new thing tbh SIM uni was smth similar,btohqsg
Actually UAS is literally nothing changed from status quo. Both alr where exceptions to the norm which could use Tutiton grant,btohqsg
What I get from Wiki:- TheSingapore Management University(SMU) is a publicly-funded private university in Singapore. Founded in 2000- TheSingapore University of Social Sciences(SUSS) is apublicautonomous universityinSingapore- TheSingapore Institute of Technology(SITorSingaporetech) is apublicautonomous universityinSingapore- TheSingapore University of Technology and Design(SUTD) is apublicautonomous universityinSingapore.-The University of the Arts Singapore[1](UAS) isSingapore's first public-funded private university of the arts. It was formally announced in 2021.,btohqsg
NUS Yale is a constituent of NUS,btohqsg
So doesn't count as independent or Autonomous,btohqsg
so SMU is still classify as Private?,btohqsg
ah so misleading the Wiki lol,btohqsg

It's government funded not government sch,btohqsg

only 6 are recognized by the government as public university,btohqsg
Bodoh they haven't updated yet la,btohqsg
UAS only started their first intake in late 2024,btohqsg
Anyways argue for what. For all intends and purposes its 7,btohqsg
aiya more public sch and more uni student = harder to find job + sch reputation decrease,btohqsg
I think is still 6 tho,btohqsg
U apply and as a student of NAFA or Laselle there isn't any difference vs in SIT anyways,btohqsg
Arts either waysall become unemployed 0 vs 0 got diff meh,btohqsg
