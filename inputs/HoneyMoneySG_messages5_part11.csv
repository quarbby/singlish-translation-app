Asking experienced UOB One card users.On the month you received your rebate from UOB  assuming $50  do I need to just spend $500 (effective payment = $450) or I need to spend $550 (effective payment = $500)?Cos I also have the credit for annual fees etc in my card balance. So wanted to find out what are some of your past experiences. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Anyways how to track the 30k top up on grab,btohqsg
track manual see in payment history  only when reach 75% it will show the warning and how much you left,btohqsg

For dbs altitude visa card for online transaction in USD do we still get 2mpd?,btohqsg
My preferred broker of choice (after getting your free stocks from moomoo & Tiger)  will be Interactive Brokershttps://bit.ly/hmsgibkrPros: Cheap fees ($0.35 USD per US order)  Favorable FX (close to spot rate)  Good Margin rate (1.6-2.6% p.a.)  Access to LSE e.g. CSPXCons: Weak UI/UX  may seem too complicated for beginners to navigate  Live prices are not free etc,btohqsg
I applied for amex card and spent 500 bucks  how do I know if I will need given the award?,btohqsg
Sir u here too! No lah I trying to know if I did qualify for the reward,btohqsg
Lol. Ok I'm not familiar with Amex. Wait for the guru,btohqsg
Try sending an email to Singsaver support. I never tried though,btohqsg
You can also try reading their Terms and Conditions  they will state some things you need to do in order to receive the award and the award usually takes quite long to arrive or process.,btohqsg
I applied for a citibank card one year back with singsaver  I spend the amount as mention but I also need to wait for 6 months without cancellation in order for my reward to be process  all in all  it took about 9-10 months or so to receive the award after. It was a long long wait.,btohqsg
I feel u I've been waiting now 6 months,btohqsg
I applied for citibank cashback + in May 2021 with Singsaver and got the rewards in Oct 2021,btohqsg

Yes ibkr for sg stocks  More for consolidation. I'm using POEMS for SRS investing S27,btohqsg
May I know for the S27 using poems do you use cash MGT or cash plus acct? Ant charges for receiving  dividend?,btohqsg
Im using Cash plus. Confirmed with Poems no charge for dividends received in SRS account. For cash investment there will be charge for dividends handling since poems is the custodian,btohqsg
