There's volunteering to entertain the elderly/do weekly checks and talk to them,btohqsg
There's giving tuition to under-privileged children,btohqsg
There's helping to distribute food to people,btohqsg
There's also stuff like volunteering at RCs or Community Centres (though I'm not sure how you should go about that),btohqsg
Really depends on what kind of thing you want to do,btohqsg

Hmm yes even to sec Chem.. notice there are 2-3 exceptions usually,btohqsg
2 insoluble chlorides  3 insoluble sulfates,btohqsg
2 oxides of metals above H can be reduced by H2,btohqsg
Silver carbonate is the only carbonate that decomposes to metal,btohqsg
