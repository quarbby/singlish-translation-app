That day my order at beef bro  waited from 7pm to 7.25pm. CS never appear in chat so never mind take screenshot liao go deliver. As long as email within 24hrs should be ok. Next day they cancel the previous order then give replacement order with waiting charges  I just click as per normal then after 5 min click completed,btohqsg
Maybe cos my that order Oddle,btohqsg
I Kena before the stupid Italian restaurant at Robertson quay. Wait for half hr  even CS online in chat (informed them since first 10 min). Restaurant staff can lie and say they give me on time,btohqsg

U believe all this right ppl. They are the most chrapo,btohqsg
1st 3 can claim  loss of income!!!,btohqsg
Your insurance will have difficulty to claim since over 24 hoirs,btohqsg
Hey guys I'm new at lalamove. Just about to pay deposit.. can I drive straight after?,btohqsg
Two vehicles  same insurer  one asshole lawyer üôÇ,btohqsg
He wan to get ur details to claim against u. If he is rich he will straight send lawyer letter,btohqsg
u must be careful he might bite u back say u bang him,btohqsg
but after 24 hours insurance might not accept if want claim,btohqsg
I aso Kena once by a 60s man in his e200.. reverse into me. horn no hear. think he partial deaf. in the end private settle on spot,btohqsg
no transfer u must within 24 hr report liao . dun wait,btohqsg
Anw simple. jus report and claim against him. Since u have cam to show that he reverse to u.,btohqsg
mine Kena bang but no scratch or dent. so just get 100 settle sua... save hassle,btohqsg
Tis type of ppl usually after accident happened. Got alot of side ppl ask him play punk 1.,btohqsg
u go to insurance see what they say,btohqsg
U have cam as eveidence. they lan lan had to proceed even he doesnt file.,btohqsg
Tis only apply like long long time ago where car cam and smartphone is not out. I personally encounter last time. End up the other party never report and my case close after 3 years.,btohqsg
where got such thing... think they play u. what insurance,btohqsg
But now technology world. If u have cam recording even they doesnt file. Ur insurance will still proceed to claim against his insurace. simple n straight forward.,btohqsg
u got video n plate number... yr insurance can go claim third party insurance liao. unless that car not insuredü§£,btohqsg
Haha. another time i also kena with a PHD doc. Find thousands of ways to siam. Than end up my insurance told me tat since he is a PR you no need to scare. My case will be 100%  50/50 so eventually his premium will cost him a big bomb if he die die wan to claim aganist u.,btohqsg
In the end he is a fking cheapo. drive a 7 series. damn bloody irratating. Keep calling me till i tell him what u wan now. if u don wan claim insurance. I poor guy no money to pay ur repair on ur 7 series.  Than in the end ask me for $250 and a private settlement letter and close the case.,btohqsg
just a light kiss huh. 7 series leh... one bumper thousands liao,btohqsg
He siam me lah. He come out from his parking lot never check got car. Directly hit my rear. Than keep saying he no wrong.,btohqsg
His headlight scratch and bumper dent. My rear all go in. U imaging how solid his car is.  Tis is why i told him since u keep saying is my fault n i have no car cam to prove. u go ahead n claim my insurance.,btohqsg
Is he keep calling me saying i am at fault i sld pay full of his repair. Than i tell him off u call me again i will report police that u harass. Right now if u wan $$ can claim my insurance n stop calling me.,btohqsg
some more if u drive Jap. the metal very light n thin,btohqsg
End up he know his premium will be damn expensive as he is a SPR and also is a 7 series. He change his mind not to claim insurance.,btohqsg
And i cannot forget tat sentence when i talk to him. He say call me and address me as Dr Tan not Mr Tan. Sibe hao lian wor. And say my jap car chepo his 7 series cost 300k.,btohqsg
At first i great him as sir. Than when he show me his IC is Tan so i call Mr Tan. end up knn so hao lian.,btohqsg
Of course he would deny.Under your motor insurance terms  you‚Äôre expected NOT to admit to wrongdoing at all to the other party‚Ä¶ if not that‚Äôs essentially a losing case for the legal coverage the policy entails.,btohqsg
He stupid cos as long he‚Äôs loaning to buy it  he owes more than you.That‚Äôs dumb üôÇ,btohqsg
84.‚Äî(1) If in any case owing to the presence of a motor vehicle on a road an accident occurs whereby damage or injury is caused to any person  vehicle  structure or animal  the driver of the motor vehicle shall stop and  if required to do so by any person having reasonable grounds for so requiring  give his name and address and also the name and address of the owner and the identification marks of the motor vehicle.(2) If in the case of any such accident as aforesaid the driver of the motor vehicle for any reason does not give his name and address to any such person as aforesaid  he shall report the accident at a police station or to a police officer as soon as reasonably practicable and  in any case  within 24 hours of the occurrence thereof.,btohqsg
a) Exchange Particulars of Parties Involved in the Accident and take note of the vehicle numbersb) Take photos of the scene of the accident and the damages to all vehicles.Call Your Insurer's Hotline for a Tow-Truck or further advice on the accidentReport the accident to your Insurer within 24 Hours or by the next working day.If you do not report an accident Your insurer may repudiate liability;Your No-Claims Discount may be docked upon the renewal of your policy; andYour insurer may cancel or refuse to renew your policy.,btohqsg
this is from the policy wording?,btohqsg
this should be from RTA 1961 i suppose,btohqsg
this is from my NTUC policy,btohqsg
"police officers are not lawyers. don't take the word for it hor.if some lawyer ask you ""why you report only AFTER 24 hours"".... you also will have a challenge to explain yourself... and let them buy your words. later the lawyer ask you the same thing.... ""police officer = lawyer?""obediently follow your insurer's policy instructions.",btohqsg
because if the police officer is legally trained.... then he/she would be wearing a white top + black bottoms and usually seen around the Courts  not in a police station.,btohqsg

Question now if do grab or gojek which platform is better?,btohqsg
Haha. If only money drop from the sky,btohqsg
grabfood I though better. higher pay less rules,btohqsg
Walauwei how come some order got restriction one got lalabag then can take,btohqsg
It's got lalabag then can see or got lalabag then can bid?,btohqsg
Wah  I try a few I click nvr see that. Issit for bike job or car job also,btohqsg
If car they chut pattern no sticker cannot bid  then can say byebye,btohqsg
"Both riders n drivers will ""enjoy"" the benefits",btohqsg
So means drivers cannot bid the bike jobs also unless have the bagü§∑,btohqsg
I'm seeing less bike jobs tdy in my app also. Wonder if it's a coincidence üòÇ,btohqsg
Some bike jobs with high demand surcharge is higher price,btohqsg
Car must extreme case. Car is got +$ only üòÇ,btohqsg
There r some situations bike have high demand and also +$,btohqsg
The few bike jobs I see in my app tdy all no high demand. Only bike multi stopüòÇ,btohqsg
This type not counted as special,btohqsg
This type with customer negotiation fee then is special,btohqsg
Once in a while will have resto have,btohqsg
They will throw out multi stop jobs  all the price will b same.,btohqsg
So if u gey the shortest km 1 u tan tio,btohqsg
I realise it's just to make the price of the job total $56,btohqsg
So the shorter the km  the higher the additional amt lor,btohqsg
I so far managed to get 3 of such jobs in the 1 yr I do llmüòÇ but must be heng. When the jobs come out u just nice looking at the appüòÇ,btohqsg
