my life only  started when i moved out,btohqsg
when i found out i had coloir imparement,btohqsg

the reason why ppl advise you to just tahan if the abuse from parents isnt physical or like harming you (eg. not feeding u) (like provided ur parents feed you  give you food and shelter and school fees  but verbally abuse you)  its best to just wait it out because ur still dependent on them for money,btohqsg
then you can just cut them out of your life once you are financially independent,btohqsg
That's a thing? Is it a boarding sch...,btohqsg
The way u shit talk is not effective,btohqsg

rationale behind BCMH 4h2H2 bio - always liked bio  required for uni course im interested in (lifesci)H2 chem- required for lifesciH2 math- think math is nice and dont want to take h1. also keeping options open cause i may want to do math related stuff in uniH2 history-always loved history and was recommended by my jh tutor to takewhy not h1 hist sinceh2 history isnt a prereq for any uni courses?- interest in southeast asian history + not very confident chemistry so can use history to replace in the uas,btohqsg
But then does lifesci require h2 chem A?,btohqsg

My sis wrote in her diary 'mad sister self-victimising' when i was confronting my parents about how i got abandoned in jc,btohqsg
my ri friend is taking 4h2 pxme üòÇ,btohqsg

From who knows how long ago,btohqsg
some people can bear grudges for damn long,btohqsg
my parents dun care about her princess syndrome,btohqsg
sg mental health: am i a joke to you,btohqsg
My therapist believes that 07 kids are the hope for our future,btohqsg
imo you shouldnt have read her diary,btohqsg
Technically she said the younger generation,btohqsg
i hvnt been talking to my sis for 2w alr  cny d2 was the last i talked to her,btohqsg
no but then like i want 70rp,btohqsg
the 2 bro are in between,btohqsg
I guess if you don‚Äôt need h2 chem A  like if they only specified a pass then closer to As can focus on history if your history is better,btohqsg
its ironic how ppl in the discord think he knows alot about the real world while tele think hes sheltered,btohqsg
is it an oldest child problem,btohqsg
is it a'levels results tmrw üôè,btohqsg
igs but i want AAAA and its only y5 so still got time,btohqsg
this is like opposite of josh,btohqsg
i just tore that page 2 days ago,btohqsg
Even tho they don't make sense conceptually,btohqsg
coz i was mad seeing what she wrote,btohqsg
no it is this year's diary,btohqsg
Ngl I would agree with him to some extent,btohqsg
Saying that u should ONLY focus on passion,btohqsg
why would he be in ra,btohqsg
and then i became the one at fault for reading her diary,btohqsg
I wud choose money and passion,btohqsg
Yeah try for all content A bit if life sci doesn‚Äôt require h2 chem A can be prepared to direct more attention towards history to ensure you can get 3 content As and 70rp,btohqsg
my dad didnt even scold her for what she wrote,btohqsg
ah ic. thanks for the advice,btohqsg
coz he said diary is meant for secret,btohqsg
its not right that you read her diary but then ur sis also did wrong,btohqsg
i actually warned him  that day when i past the diary to him  he ask me put back (he blind or dunno what)  i was like 'if it lands on my hand again im gonna destroy it',btohqsg
Yeah but like if you think you‚Äôre doing decently for all subs then no need to divert attention  since no need to worry about splitting your time equally for both only to get like both B,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs only closer to As then consider,btohqsg
he compared that to me scolding them with my mouth,btohqsg
welp just coz i wun apologise to my sis  he said 'i hv not learnt my lesson' and he wun fetch me to school / anywhere,btohqsg
ur sis should like keep her diary in a place where other ppl cant open it,btohqsg
idk im a bad sis but i hope my sis flunk her Os,btohqsg
anyway my A level score is__  idk their chances,btohqsg
i think my A levels score was too high for them to beat,btohqsg
if someone who hurt you before want to reconcile should you accept,btohqsg
actually this time is real and not being bad  i dun thnk my sis will survive JC,btohqsg
mugging in sec sch?? complaining about shit at the start of sem???,btohqsg
I would say this abt my sis also,btohqsg

Normal sane is diff from psychoemotionally healtgt,btohqsg
idk why every time i complain about stuff  my aunt / parents / stupid sis thinks it is self-victimizing,btohqsg

actually my memory got triggered after my brother entered jc,btohqsg
anyway kuro if someone wanna run for classcomm do u have advice,btohqsg
they dun even care about my feeling  stress etc  how is it possible to communicate with them,btohqsg
and then they complain i listen more to friends,btohqsg

This was scheduled to send at 1900,btohqsg
This was scheduled to send at 1901,btohqsg
like say real   idk how your study schedule is like but the best study plan is a plan that is sustainable - you can stick to it until the end of A levels. It wouldnt help if you rush and stress so much at the start because then you gon hit your breaking point when the pace picks up and commitment gets heavier,btohqsg
not wrong. Y > R in terms of lettering,btohqsg
went thru this guys comments and um he be shitting on vegans LOL,btohqsg

Hey guys. How‚Äôs YI results collection like?,btohqsg
actl im still kinda recovering from the fact that the guy that hurt me so badly is taking h2 bio + im not even that mad at him anymore when i hated him so much in y3,btohqsg

Still by class (some in hall  some in library  some in their own classes etc),btohqsg
What‚Äôs the point of being so negative and depressed from the start. If you gonna be like this for your whole jc life shouldn‚Äôt have gone in the first place and you‚Äôd be happier. If you keep thinking you‚Äôd do badly even this early on it might rly manifest itself.,btohqsg
do u actually think im being serious,btohqsg
when i say im going to kms,btohqsg
the chances of me doing that is near 0,btohqsg
dm cause i alr said enough about myself here,btohqsg

like if i were to be very honest,btohqsg
i feel like florals is being too hard on herself,btohqsg
bc of my sec sch n family,btohqsg
Samaritans of SingaporeHours: Available 24 hours.call: 1-767,btohqsg
i have a degree of autism spectrum and schizoid,btohqsg
to be very honest with u i have more homicidal thoughts than suicidal,btohqsg
Yeah but like must have more confidence in yourself leh. And not constantly think your fate is destined to be bad,btohqsg
i mean based on her prv msg. ur not wrong to make tht kind of assumption,btohqsg
not being mean but a bit serve them right for not caring about their studies (different story of u study hard then somehow screwd up),btohqsg
Like i really feel so sorry for one of my friends who managed a merit for h3 econs but her h2 idk how she got c,btohqsg
the drug im taking to help me sleep everyday increases chances of developing dementia if used in long term,btohqsg
Not as easy as to type itüò¢,btohqsg
This happened to another friend too (but chem),btohqsg
i told my psychologist abt this once n she got so shocked lol,btohqsg
But she couldnt retake in sch coz apparently need screw up damn bad,btohqsg
i told her in a very apathetic and tense tone,btohqsg
Then she was bold ah to do uni + retake as private (coz she really want be doctor),btohqsg

That is a bit too far in the future ah,btohqsg
maybe i just stopped caring so much,btohqsg
like i feel like feelings dont matter anymore,btohqsg
Man using my GP skills  that's an ABSOLUTE statement,btohqsg
ive been taking it for many months,btohqsg
tbh i feel like in the real world ppl use each other alot but its okay,btohqsg
at this rate my mental health issues r just a joke to me lol,btohqsg
i also dk why i liddat,btohqsg
Tbh learning psych make my psych,btohqsg
