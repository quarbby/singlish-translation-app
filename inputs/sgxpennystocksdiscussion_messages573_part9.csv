This is a common misperception by many CPF members and is not true. CPF members need not rush to buy their properties before reaching 55 years old. They can reserve all or part of their Ordinary Account (OA) savings before they turn 55  to pay for their housing needs after age 55. The OA savings reserved will not be transferred to their Retirement Account (RA) and can be used to pay for an existing property or to buy one in future.https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-no-need-for-cpf-members-to-rush-to-buy-properties-before-age-55,btohqsg
