✏️Pika World Markets Update- 30 May 2023🎲1) International markets were mixed mainly on Monday on the backdrop of what seemed like a preliminary deal that emerged out of intensive and worrying US debt ceiling negotiation.2) Shortly after the deal was reached  we saw text released by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Biden to help gather support among their base to pass the bill.3) There is an expectation that the congressional votes can begin as early as Wednesday in the House despite already some opposition surfacing on both political aisles.4) The US Dollar took some heat off the market on Friday and Monday  given the positive consensus from the debt ceiling resolution as it dilutes economic instability.5) With the PCE index hotter  analysts are betting on possibly more rate hikes ahead.Based on our earlier analysis  we maintain our fully valued stance on the market as the euphoria fades and the market is back to the recession fear.Have a hippy morning  friends!Pika Nat.😘🫕🍝,btohqsg
