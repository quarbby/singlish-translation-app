Genting Hong Kong Says Shipbuilder Insolvency to Spark Defaults1. Genting Hong Kong  the troubled cruise operator controlled by Malaysian tycoon Lim Kok Thay  warned Tuesday of more defaults due to the insolvency of its German shipbuilding subsidiary.2. The company ‚Äúconsiders that it has exhausted all reasonable efforts‚Äù to negotiate with counter-parties under the current financing arrangements  it said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange.3. That came after MV Werften  an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary  filed for insolvency on Monday to a local court in Germany  as salvage talks between the local governments and Genting came to a dead end. Potential cross defaults arising from that insolvency could amount to $2.78 billion  and relevant creditors affected ‚Äúmay have the right‚Äù to either demand payment or take actions regarding the financing terms  Genting said.More here,btohqsg

Interesting fact on French:For the French car is not a status symbol but a commodity.

üíéPika World Pulse: Market Conviction-less Rallyüíéüß®Will Omicron kill the travel industry?‚úàÔ∏èThe travel sector has been met with multiple headwinds: from the stringent air and sea travel guidelines to the development of new variants. While the pandemic has hit the industry hard  some analysts are warming to the idea of accumulating airline stocks in the wait for a bounce again.What‚Äôs with this optimism?First  while the virus hits the general population  many airline crews do not wish to be held in hotels. There is a general inclination to be back home  which means that airlines have been working hard to combine flights into larger aircraft for better efficiency.The pent-up demand for travel remains robust as the CDC guideline on isolation appears to be less restrictive than before  given a larger vaccinated population. This means more crews can return to work earlier than the prior waves. As such  each successive wave of variant appears to deal a less destructive blow to the sector than early 2020.üé¢Should you be buying the Dip?ü•äWithout a doubt  it is a silent question for some to Pika World. After all  the rate hikes in 2018 had caused a near bear market correction to S&P 500  and investors aren‚Äôt ready for such an episode to repeat.Major indexes had dived since the start of the year from their all-time high too.Again  what could be some optimism?First  market participants are pricing a high possibility for a rate hike in March. Hence  the outcome is that the Fed delivers one rate hike as anticipated  or it does not do so in the March FOMC meeting and sends a potential rally for the stock. This means that there is a larger space for the Fed to appear more dovish than having a hawkish stance on a risk-reward probability.Moreover  a slower rate-hike pace will usher two roses to the equity market. First  it will soften the drag on the economic growth and dampen the gain seen in the 10-year treasury yield that hurts Nasdaq.We are seeing less desire for bond investors to buy 10 year treasury yield given that short-term interest rates have been rising fast. Hence  if the short term interest rate slows in its momentum  we could see the same spell out for long term bonds yield. That‚Äôs double happiness for the stock market.üìÆOur Outlooküí∞Pika World believes the 10-year treasury yield is likely to march towards 2%  thus putting pressure on high growth stocks. Such expectations need not be a surprise since long-term inflation expectations are well above 2%. Logically  bond investors would demand a return higher than inflation and it is a matter of time that the 10-year treasury yield has to exceed 2% in such an anticipation path.Nonetheless  suppose earnings growth can expand   stocks can still rise higher in 2022  and that‚Äôs the framework of thought we laid out in our previous weekend edition  where we shared that earnings growth will become the driver of the market bull trajectory.We hope you enjoy this edition and see you in the next one!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

It‚Äôs easier to play if you have the holding power. Trading is harder game to master as there are many other factors to look at. Investing on the other end  is boring but no stress.For this PanUnited call made almost a year back at $0.285. Currently $0.34 which equates to 15% ROI.

ü©∫Pika World Markets InsightüéôüéàFeel the pain?üî´While the Fed has not raised any interest rate  some stocks sensitive to economic development are starting to feel the pain. For example  the industrials  materials and transport sectors are among those that are affected by the prospect of a higher interest rate environment.Companies are feeling the pinch as borrowing costs is on the rise. Often known as the corporate credit spreads  investors expect more yields for owning the company‚Äôs bonds. In addition  economically sensitive stocks are highly impacted as their demand rises and falls  given their cyclical nature.In a nutshell  a higher credit spread of such cyclical firms means that investors are asking for a higher yield on the bonds due to the earnings risk.Ultimately  the outcome is mainly dependent on how fast inflation moves and whether the Fed will be aggressively hiking interest rates.üí∞The test of the marketüî®Companies may find it more challenging to meet Wall Streets estimate. If this is true  then the bull market may have lesser fuel on the run. We are ushering in another new earnings season  starting with the big banks.So why would companies disappoint in their earnings? There is often a trend for analysts to quickly push up a company‚Äôs profit during recovery or the early expansion phase. However  as we enter the mid-cycle phase in 2022  the earnings may tend to be less impressive such that growth may start to moderate.Pika World shall dive deep into the latest earnings seasons to explore any signs of weakness  especially with the onset of Omicron.üèÄInflation is still Hotü•äThe latest CPI continued to reflect a hot price market. On the bright side  it wasn't worst than anticipated and this gives a tiny comfort to the equity market. All eyes are now on the FOMC meeting next week where we will likely receive new clues on the Fed's monetary trajectory and with the earnings season coming  the market is back on a volatile mode as we had seen since mid Nov 2021.Pika World wishes everyone a prosperous trading day ahead!Pika Nat.,btohqsg

üíéPika World Pulse: Understanding Quantitative TaperingüíéIt's yet another sell on the rally! Just as we have a friendly Uncle Powell singing melody for a relief rally  the Fed Vice-Chair Brainard dropped another bomb to the market where he consider a quicker rate hike and possibly balance sheet runoff that spook the markets once again. Nasdaq dived down despite the treasury yield giving support to the market.üß®A ballon floatingü•äSince the onset of the pandemic  the Fed's balance sheet had increased dramatically  to hit $9 trillion and is still growing. Therefore  with the reduction in monetary support  investors naturally turn their attention to the prospects of central banks reducing the asset portfolio.The December FOMC meeting minutes had confirmed the debate on the normalisation policy for the balance sheet. Moreover  the discussion was seen as more robust than anticipated.During Uncle Powell's confirmation hearing  he spoke about such tightening prospects soon.üí∞Balance Sheet has a profound effectüé¢With such a large balance sheet  the consequences of a smaller balance sheet goal are more important than interest rate hikes. Quantitative tightening is the opposite of the QE  which we know.In Quantitative Tightening (QT)  the Fed will receive the principal sum from the treasury holdings but will not reinvest them into new treasuries. The Fed is likely to tread this path carefully because it involves the draining of liquidity in the bank reserve balances. The Fed may not know the exact amount needed for the financial system to function correctly  thus is unlikely to take an aggressive stance.In 2017  the Fed had started the QT at an initial pace of $6 billion and climbed to $30 billion until mid-2019 when there was a sudden sharp rise in the repo rates- the rate at which investors exchange their Treasuries for cash for short term money needs.üí°How does it work?üî≠Consider the following. When the Fed receives $20 billion in principal repayment of its treasury holdings and embarks on a $15 QT program  it will essentially roll over $5 billion to buy newly issued treasury bills. Hence  it drains a total of $15 billion from the financial system.üìÆOur Outlookü™úPika World does not believe the Fed will remove all of its QE  given the economy is still prone to downside risk on Omicron. Moreover  the withdrawal is likely to impact asset prices that had expanded aggressively.Hence  a Fed's measured step in the balance sheet's normalisation will soothe investors nervousness and prolong the economic expansion as Uncle Powell spoke about.We hope you enjoy this edition and see you in the next one!Cheers Pika Nat,btohqsg
