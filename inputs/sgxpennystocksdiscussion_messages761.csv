🎉Pika World Daily Review – 14 Feb 2023🎉🥃A green day ahead of CPI data💰The equity market rose on Monday as it tried to put away the past week's losses and start the week with a firm footing. However  the optimism before CPI data is dangerous as it built a lot of expectations ahead of the data release.As we have seen  the strong showing in Nasdaq this week is built on the foundation that inflation is moderating consistently. This helps to alleviate the worry of the aggressive rate hike that had to dominate traders' minds in 2022.Nonetheless  we are mindful of being cautious ahead of the data.🧸Increasing number of news signalling worsening inflation🎯While the CPI data can be anyone's guess  more news reports are portraying that the inflation reading could be ugly; indeed  if there is a U-turn in the reading  showing any form of an uptick in inflation  the animal spirit of short-selling could scale up  unleashing massive downward dive of major index.We are still seeing stubborn stickiness in food prices. Likewise  gasoline prices have gone up in January. All these point to some worries. We could not escape from our long position and will be riding through this volatile period 📮What are our dishes today?📖At 9.30 pm  the long waited for CPI data for (MoM) is expected to accelerate from 0.1% to 0.5%.On a YoY basis  we expect it to fall from 6.4% to 6.2%.After which  12.30 am will see  FOMC Member Harker will speak  and at 3.05 am  FOMC member William will also deliver a speech.Given the CPI release and FOMC members' speeches  expect a constant swing in the market.It is 14 Feb  Tuesday  8.45 am in Singapore and 7.45 pm in New York. We shall catch up upon the data release.From your lovely newsdesk friend Pika Nat,btohqsg

"Is Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust (LMIRT) A Buy At 11% Yield?""Lippo Malls Indonesia Trust (LMIRT) had some outstanding growth – gross revenues up 68%  net property income (NPI) up 91%.In its latest 9M2022 results – gross revenues soared 23%  NPI grew 30%.These huge growth numbers were driven by lower discounts and rebates given to tenants during the COVID pandemic. Pretty impressive.I mean  over the last three years that LMIRT retail malls were shut  it didn’t collect rent  its malls even had to give rental reliefs.And now that shopping malls in Indonesia are opening up  and social restrictions lifted  foot traffic is returning to the good old pre-COVID days.In fact  foot traffic has steadily climbed back up to 65% of pre-COVID traffic.""Our community member Willie Keng has shared his review on Lippo Malls Indonesia Retail Trust's 9M2022 results  visitor traffic growth and debt problems.Read more here:https://www.investingnote.com/posts/2580907#lmirt#reit#investing#community",btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 15 Feb 2023🎉💸A bumpy ride for the inflation story🥃Even as the general price level in the economy is falling  progress is slower than expected. This could push the Fed to do more to help cool inflation. That’s what we had seen in the latest CPI economic data result.The annual rise in CPI of 6.4% is just a tick down from the prior period of 6.5%  making it the seven consecutive months of improvement seen in the inflation reading. While this is encouraging  the CPI had risen by 0.5% in January  far higher than the 0.1% climb in December.This report shows that the tight labour market is still fueling inflation in a hot economy  and inflationary pressure remains. We may not see a rapid decline as expected  and the Fed will have to raise its hands again to call for more rate hikes.Market participants are generally at even odds with a further 25 basis point hike in March FOMC. This may put some pressure on the equity market.📱Plantir: Light at the end of the tunnel?💎Finally  shares are popping higher as earnings were robust after the company registered its first GAAP profit. It expects to remain profitable in 2023 as it cramps down on spending. This is sufficient for investors to cheer on its progress.Nonetheless  its first-quarter guidance was light on expectation  but investors gave reasons for the dismay  as the company is finishing its unpopular program of investments through SPAC mergers. This means that revenue from the SPAC program is likely to moderate from $39 million a year ago to $16 million.We could give some slack for Plantir partly because the first quarter tends to be its seasonally weak period.Let’s hope for another good quarter to boost investors’ momentum.📮What are our dishes today?📖Tons of data will be rolling out today.At 9.30 pm  we will have the Core Retail Sales (MoM) for Jan. We should expect a growth of 0.8%  reversing from a decline of 1.1% in the prior period.Many other data will be released concurrently  such as the NY Empire State Manufacturing Index  which should hint at improvement.Retail sales for MoM for Jan should rise by 1.8% compared to a decline in the previous period.Then at 10.15 pm  the Industrial Production (MoM) for January should see a rise of 0.5% compared to -0.7%.Business Inventories data will be out at 11 pm. We can expect modest growth of 0.3%  comparable to the prior 0.4%.It is 15 Feb  Tuesday  at 9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. Often  the day after CPI data is in a big swing. Let’s hope for sustainable market stability.From your lovely newsdesk friend Pika Nat.,btohqsg
