She is in love with who...hmn,btohqsg
Gude is a bird right? So this one must be bf,btohqsg
I mean which one fits an egg yolk more,btohqsg
Still the bottom  the top looks more like a tangerine,btohqsg
oh ya there is also terence,btohqsg
Who did the a level exam today?,btohqsg
Which exam board‚Äôs papers do they use in Singapore?,btohqsg
May I just say the tate bros are such comic relief during periods of stress,btohqsg
Everyone check out their clips for therapy,btohqsg
You sat for the papers in Singapore or the UK?,btohqsg
The only UK GCE I sat for was the O level Econs paper since in Singapore moe/seab does not set their own local version,btohqsg
Oh which exam board? I read online that Edexcel is easier for math,btohqsg
I still don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs the rationale behind having multiple exam boards,btohqsg
to profit. Or sit the easier variant of the paper to get A*.UK A-Levels have OCR AQA EdExcel Cambrdige,btohqsg
An LTA enforcement officer was killed while chasing a fleeing motorcyclist on the SLE.The 18-year-old rider he was believed to be pursuing was arrested on charges of:- Failing to stop when ordered to- dangerous driving- driving without a valid licence and insurance coverage- possession of scheduled weapons- suspected drug-related activities:https://cna.asia/3R9jR0g,btohqsg
Maybe sg authorities should have a no pursuit policy,btohqsg
What's the point of chasing knowing full well they can catch the license plate  just inform all checkpoints of said license plate. Trace cameras and throw a public alert,btohqsg
so that he won't be a public hazard to others?,btohqsg
I dont know about you  but forging license plates are a thing,btohqsg
Yea I know that's why I say throw public alert for rider,btohqsg
Idk but to me the hazard he pose to himself running is substantially way more than the hazard he pose to others around him. Especially weaving through big trucks like he did while escapingHe continues  it's only a matter of time he dies to his actions,btohqsg
anyone here knows where to find job shadowing opportunities,btohqsg
What's the point of chasing someone that does not want to not only stop but choose to go above and beyond in order to get away. If he is not stopping  so the chaser is expecting him to crash. Isn't itThen what they expect  crash alr..oh close two/three lanes of expressway for hrs. Then arrest the person. Which part of this scenario is beneficial to people that don't care about their safety or others,btohqsg
Because there is a possibility he might crash into a school bus killing 20 people potentially instead of that 1 officer.,btohqsg
Then what makes you think the outcome could be any different engaging in a chase.Where speeds are likely higher and intensity to push the limits become stronger knowing full well there is a person right behind you.,btohqsg
I think the outcome would be different because the officer is a personnel that I trust will act and actively intervene in good faith for the sole purpose of order and public safety.,btohqsg
Need write paper 1 english article and my brain aint working,btohqsg
If you were wanted by authority.You won't be running full speed through traffic if you see that the authoritive Figure decided to give up chasing you 15 cars behind. Because you don't want to be spotted by another authoritive figure down the roadYou will most definitely be running full speed through traffic if the authoritive figure was chasing you 15 cars behind and not slow down if you see another authoritive figure down the road since you knew one was alr actively chasing you,btohqsg
"Why add onto the ego of the rider by introducing another layer of ""escaping the police"" to feed his ego even more",btohqsg
You are assuming rationality on the part of the criminal whom already by virtue of being chased has proven if anything they aren't conforming to societal laws and rules.,btohqsg
Just like how I am not assuming logic on your part by virtue of your retarded answers,btohqsg
"It does not matter if they aren't conforming to societal laws but it undeniable to the fact that ""escaping the police in a chase"" is fuel to the fire to any criminal",btohqsg
So why add fuel to the fire,btohqsg
They live for the adrenaline of engaging in a chase by authority  they yearn to outrun them...it's not the fact to escape them  it's just the fact to show that they have the capability of escaping them,btohqsg
So there is no virtue signaling because I'm outlining literally what is a known fact,btohqsg
And you are assuming they do it for fun based on what? Your own experience breaking the rules?,btohqsg
Because they don't do anything to hide the fact they are speeding???,btohqsg
Like literally do you honestly think people in Singapore run from the police to actually escape the police for a decade?,btohqsg
No..they just want to engage in the thrill of a chase  of driving fast.,btohqsg
The definition of ‚ÄúRashly‚Äù according to the penal code.26E.‚Äî(1)¬†¬†Whoever does any act knowing that there isa real risk that a particular circumstance exists or will exist is said to do that act rashly¬†in¬†respect of that particular circumstance  if it would have been unreasonable to have taken that risk.[15/2019](2)¬†¬†Whoever does any act knowing that there is a real risk that an effect will be caused is said to do that act rashly¬†in¬†respect of that effect  if it would have beenunreasonable to have taken that risk.[15/2019](3)¬†¬†Where doing an act rashly is a fault element of an offence  that fault element is also established where that act is doneintentionally or knowingly.,btohqsg
Unreasonable is literally baked into the system and the law and SOP assumes irrationality on the part of the offender,btohqsg
I don't understand why you think what I said is a assumption of anything,btohqsg
They just wantHow do u know this to be true? Are you the offender u have done what decades of research in criminology could never do. You managed to crack the definitive reason for the commission of a crime. Someone should give you a medal for your breakthrough.,btohqsg
Ok then can you give another reason other than thrill? Most are certainly not escaping because they don't want to be caught for crimes they may have done,btohqsg
I have just explain it to you. We have no definitive explanation on why criminals act it is also written into the definition itself that a rash act is against the ideal of rationale itself.,btohqsg
"It's not a breakthrough  it's just that they can't state the reason as ""thrill""",btohqsg
I feel like you have achieved a mastery being the epitome of what circular reasoning entails. The definition of thrill itself just shifts the term to another word of the English lexicon and we end up exactly where we started just this time u have wasted my time and everyone's sanity in having to read your pointless twattle mixed with unintelligible gobbledegook in a pointless attempt to support a flawed argument from it's conception.,btohqsg
idk i tot the guy run away cuz he has possession of drugs üíÄ,btohqsg
You literally accused me of assuming the rationality of someone that could and would run from the law when all I mentioned was that you don't have to look into law to understandChasing someone always make that person run harder and faster irregardless of whatever other reasoning they have,btohqsg
Idk why you have to bring the rationality of the individual or his reasonings. No matter how you see it  someone chasing will always add danger to any situation,btohqsg
