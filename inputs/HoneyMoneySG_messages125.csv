Hi  anyone used chocolate finance recently? Was testing it out and wondering about the rates. Seems like the daily int did not meet the 4.2% was wondering when the top up int will be effected?,btohqsg
When did you transferred in your money?,btohqsg
If you have max $20k  your daily interest shall be $2.31 or $2.32. Is it correct?,btohqsg
If over 20k u will be subject to market return  so u need to keep it at 20k and withdraw daily. So just keep at 19950,btohqsg
Yea  I did a test top up to check on the returns. So far  the returns were <4.2%. Was wondering if they are fluctuating daily and would be topped up by Choc Fin,btohqsg
Thanks reminding. I realised that 4.2p.a. so should be correct if I prorated it on a monthly basis. Just realised that I was calculating the p.a. for monthly int.,btohqsg

Sms first 9 digits or last 9 digits to participate? First 9 starts with 151?,btohqsg
eh it is in the first page of the PDF.. please read.,btohqsg
If they write last is more clear lol. Because first 3 digit on the app is branch code. But it's needed for GIRO setup. 🤦🏻‍♂️,btohqsg
T&c say first 9. But I sent last 9 also 🤣,btohqsg
Fking HSBC really. If you try to send the first 9 which includes branch code maybe will fail.,btohqsg
nerf is true. may not be small for some ppl,btohqsg
big nerf. utilities bill is no small matter for families,btohqsg
May I introduce the UOB One card  which gives 4.33% cash rebate for SP Power BillsIn the event you KPKB you want OEM power generator HOW?!?!?!  may i introduce Tuaspower which uses SP Billing.QED,btohqsg
Its a big nerf. Was waiting for my Stanchart ntb status to reset and get this card for utilities. Too bad. 🥲,btohqsg
and u want to endure SCB refusal to waive annual fees? BOO TO SCB,btohqsg
Ikr? I kena this year. My annual spend for this year is 90k sia wtf,btohqsg
I really don’t understand. This would be my first time trying the sms. So I should ignore the first three digits?,btohqsg
my only comfort to you is YOU ARE NOT ALONE.even my $30k peasant card (simplycash) got rejected for annual fee waiver,btohqsg
Idk if their cashback for utilities is worth this  I need to go and calculate the cashback I got for utilities outweigh the annual fee.But their OTP shit is annoying. I press approve  and then it says failed? Then I have to sit there for 2 minutes waiting for it to change to sms. Cannot retrigger or manually send OTPI using the ‘peasant’ card also haha. I don’t like miles,btohqsg
You scared just send first 9 and last 9 la. They will send you SMS confirmation. SMS is mostly free what.,btohqsg
"when we will get the ""refund"" of 10000 points?",btohqsg
"how many days is the ""otw""?",btohqsg
Usually within 2 days  after waiver is approved.,btohqsg
the screenshot says first 9 digit ah,btohqsg
Is there an updated TNC? The terms and rewards are all over the place,btohqsg
last time when i newbie i used to send EGA SMS every month as i lost track which cycle i was in.,btohqsg
Yeah won't go wrong. SMS is mostly free,btohqsg
watch out for those promos where the LAST or FIRST SMS is the overriding one,btohqsg
Yes hahaha so far don't have,btohqsg
Yes  i feedbacked it earlier and they are managing it now,btohqsg
Hi all  does anyone happen to know what is Moneysmart MCC? Planning to buy their points to redeem something of higher value,btohqsg
Eh crap  I just saw the new utilities exclusion. There's like no reason for me to use this already  except for Amaze linked spends,btohqsg
Do you have Amaze card? do an empty wallet test? Heymax suggested 5734 for Moneysmart.,btohqsg
I have always sent first 9 digits and it has worked,btohqsg
It is confusing  right… so Last 9 digits!,btohqsg
Thr tnc say first 9. Why u all wanna do something else,btohqsg
Why not just follow T&C and send first 9?,btohqsg
probably they are shutting down cc biz? or try to be hero to change spore cc landspace,btohqsg
i think they are just trolling,btohqsg
I go google search the oldie HWZ and got ppl comment that the EGA last three digits always 221. So  only first 9 is unique to individuals,btohqsg
How long does UOB do waiver for the credit card? They just deducted 10k points... submitted the waiver request,btohqsg
I send 2 to be safe😁,btohqsg
Through the chat assists or must call?,btohqsg
was phone call because system didn't allow waiver,btohqsg
Bcoz i just realized i sent last 9 last month,btohqsg
lol don't u all just copy and paste the previous SMS? how can do wrong one,btohqsg
With the new exclusions  refusal to waive annual fees (even for near 100k spends)  I think SCB might be dying and trying to cut cost. But lol  they will just suffer,btohqsg
More like they dont need customers in their credit card segments and choose to focus on other businesses.,btohqsg
Trying to be objective here.I think it is wise not to troll and intentionally state wrong instructions  even if to punish lazy people who don't read.,btohqsg
For HSBC Bonus Interest Campaign:I'm putting it out here that  it is the first 9 digits (as always).And this is as per T&C posted here.Admins may remove misinformation postsEdit: add picture,btohqsg
Doubt so. CC is always an easy avenue to early extra money for people with poor financial decisions 🤭,btohqsg
"I think some of us did had a good laugh from the trolling 😂Btw may i ask for EGA bonus interest  generally do you guys get the bonus interest according to the time line as stated in the tnc?  I got a line stating ""EVERYDAY+ BONUS INTEREST"" on 5th July when i only opened account and deposit on 12th Jun for the June promo. May I ask what is this item?",btohqsg
That's for Everyday+. Bonus interest usually is by the end of month  2 months after registration month. Can check t&c for info.,btohqsg

For UOB lady  how successful isit to upgrade to solitaire?,btohqsg
Hi guys. may i know what's the best card for cash back currently? for Dining / transport/ Groceries and digital subscriptions.,btohqsg
Anyone has appeal through for paynow sala for uob one saving before? Forgot to transfer in for July 😭,btohqsg
is yours a fake or real transfer,btohqsg
u can try but i would think it is hardone of my humans managed to appeal successfully a real salary when the company paid salary twice in november and didn't pay in december anymore (something like early salary),btohqsg
and somemore i guess u are appealing 2 things:1. salary crediting2. bonus interest payment (this might be even harder),btohqsg
Yeap  I called in earlier. They said it's easy if it's real Giro salary but harder for paynow sala. CS told me to paynow twice now and then to see if can appeal through,btohqsg
Wah the CS is very accommodating. And they are clearly aware of people doing this :),btohqsg
Yep  will update in here I managed to get it done so next time people can try. Quite significant amount since I am getting the max interest on 150k. Without the salary  Interest became 10% of what I was supposed to get 😩,btohqsg
yeah they need to cater for 'genuine' cases like parent paying a full time child or hawker paying dish washer?these days after covid.. a lot of freelance work,btohqsg
"Yeap I did mention that I am ""freelancer"" hahaha",btohqsg
Do you know bank can easily see your CPF contributions from company via SingPass sync?,btohqsg
maybe maybank family and friends. But dining dun include 5814,btohqsg
Only if I sign in and allow? Or if I applied credit card b4 they can ANY time check my cpf?,btohqsg
Does red mart on Lazada give us 4mpd for hsbc revolution? According to Hermax it’s 0.4mpd or it shall be categorised as spend on Lazada? Since we are using Lazada apps to buy online,btohqsg
Yes but it doesn’t categorize as 5311 as Lazada?,btohqsg
5411  not 5311 so you won't get 4mpd,btohqsg
Ya the same app can give different mcc depending on what you are buying from them,btohqsg
hi  for uob one card  is the quarter spending calculation based on the statement date? or is it based on the card approval date?,btohqsg
Lazada has multiple MCC and sometimes different MCC for the same item,btohqsg
that means if i change the statement date  the calculation period will be shorten/extended?,btohqsg
"Wrote a summary for myself then realise@mttelegrammthad written something similar.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/216218Anyway  I thought would be good to share.

By end of aug. Usually mid month,btohqsg
Code word to reply further similar questions will be#ASKED999,btohqsg
If I received $0.11 of interest on 31st July for my E Saver account  does it mean my ADB for July 2024 = SGD264?actually i expected $1 ADB  since I kept $1 most of the time!!!,btohqsg
errrr... ok i don't understand how $1 ADB in July 2024 will get 11 cents of interest.. but whatever....,btohqsg
lol  good that u earn a few cents extra,btohqsg
Let me explain my strategy why I care about this.Because August is a weekend ending month. 31st August is a Saturday. 1st September is a Sunday.This is particularly important for HSBC EGA due to $250k daily transfer limits.So I will make sure I move out my HSBC EGA funds into my $1 Esaver such that my HSBC EGA is empty ($2000) on 30th August. All the funds sitting in Esaver.Then only move the funds from Esaver on 2nd September (Monday) onwards into the second human's HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
This strategy continues to be useful as 29th September is a Sunday as well.Anything sitting in a $1 ADB Esaver will earn 3.35% p.a. while waiting to be moved into HSBC EGA.,btohqsg
wah i just got the HSBC EGA official email and it has no details of the PDF that was shared yesterday. Guess that's the difference between a plankton HSBC customer vs the whales who got the PDF from their RMs.. sigh...,btohqsg

If need to spend $3K (1 transaction) at either a Fraser mall (earning Fraser rewards) or CapitaLand mall (earning capistar rewards)  which one more worth it in terms of the mall rewards?  Anyone evaluated before?,btohqsg
Random cashback of around 0.1 to 0.3%.,btohqsg
Need to see promotion  capitaland base reward cap at 1k spending  fraser is 500 spending,btohqsg
check with the merchant if they are ok for ONE PAYMENT  but multiple accounts to scan points,btohqsg
those high margin merchants.. e.g. beauticians... all very willing to cooperate one,btohqsg
I invest in brokage but it doesn't consider as a transaction or a saving it is considered as advice. The most I can only save 100 to 200 the rest is on investment,btohqsg
In this case I think Uob stash might work for u. As long as gradual increase per month,btohqsg
But it only limit up to 100k at 3 percent interest,btohqsg
When u see there state 5 percent interest in actual u calculate it gives only 3 percent,btohqsg
If u can’t clock card spend each month your choices are very limited,btohqsg
Saving acc in the bank I just don't want to leave it unattended I rather it earn some good interest also,btohqsg
So what if I have more than 100k when stash limit is 100k what should I do with the rest 🤔,btohqsg

I think sooner or later u will face block like mind. Better to park longer.The hsbc account from last night 820pm until now still blocked no call from fraud dept. Called hsbc Hotline 3 times still no return call. Tomorrow going to ask RM for help,btohqsg
I do it every month. I already went through enhanced due diligence with the banks already. So far no more issues. Touch wood.But I never do last minute one. Always have 1-2 days buffer.,btohqsg
Just remember once kenna questioned. Always tell the truth. Always provide all information requested. Never ignore them.,btohqsg
The department questioning u don’t care about you playing rewards. They only want to ensure your money is clean.,btohqsg
Its good to have 1-2 days buffer coz I was talking to a CSO from another bank and some banks aware of your money movement as the transfers do will have footprints. Which is why some customers are not able to fulfill some promo conditions because it is basically a merry-go-round.,btohqsg
Yup some banks do not like u merry go round  they will just serve notice and close account without providing reason. It does not mean money clean then no issue.,btohqsg
Anyway just do it while stocks last.From the looks of it the high savings accounts won’t last very much longer once us start cutting rates.,btohqsg

For SG issued cards  Citibank and HSBC for Qatar and Etihad  Amex for Emirates.,btohqsg
I see heymax listparking.sgas mcc 7523 though. Not excluded by Uob absolute Amex. Accurate?,btohqsg
Dobin also says UOB Absolute is eligible for 1.7%,btohqsg
Can share how do you maximise the benefits at 3.6% + 1% if you are using 2 human EGA accounts at the same time? Isn't it better to rotate every month to benefit from the 1% on incremental ADB?,btohqsg

i see  for the very first quarter it is stated that the cashback is pro-rated  does it mean that if i only hit the min spend for 2nd month (2000) and 3rd month (500)  i can get 1/3*200 (pro-rated for 2nd month) and 1/3*50 (pro-rated for 3rd month)?,btohqsg
no  in this example it met 500 tier only  get 2/3 of 50,btohqsg

Usually mcc really depends on how the entity registered their business. Deliveroo is 5812 while foodpand 5499 and grab food 5814. :),btohqsg

Hi  for Maybank Platinum Visa  if I received cashback this July is this deducted from my eligible spend for July? Ex. I want to hit $300 min spend but got $33 cashback  does that mean I have to spend $300 or $300+33? Thanks!,btohqsg
spending is spending  not affected by cashback,btohqsg
For uob one shell cashback  anyone know if spend in Malaysia shell also eligible for cashback?,btohqsg

If you guys were in your 20s with savings of 5 digits on the lower side  have very little knowledge regarding finances and are keen to maximise your savings and wealth  what would the steps you guys taktakee to,btohqsg
Set aside money for housing and education  the rest wait for crash then all in into nasdaq,btohqsg
1) set up an account with ocbc 360 or uob one account if you’re working  rack up side gains from the interest as a long term ongoing thing and save as much as you can for the first couple of years2) after 2-3 years  start dca-ing monthly just few hundred into an s&p 500 or nasdaq etf.. and then really hope that both indexes can really maintain 10-12% cagr growth,btohqsg
I am new to all this. I've been working ft for the past year and so. Just accumulated low 5 digits savings. I thought it was time for me to upgrade my finances. Thank you for the advice. Anything else i should read up on or anything else to take note of?,btohqsg

I have to admit  i am also not the most in the know of the fundamentals that may / may not drive each individual company and such and their respective stocks.But that is why a broader market index etf can help newer and even intermediate investors get exposure in the market.. the longer term growth of these two highlighted indices are also aligned with the long term of us economyAnd then down the road you can look at how your spending / credit card strategy can help support your lifestyle… but i guess one step at a time!,btohqsg

So far I only see 5311  buat some people see different mcc,btohqsg
Depends on your valuation of mile. In general ocbc 90n has better value in cardup than other general spend card due to special promo code.,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Which 4x miles card to link to PayPal?,btohqsg

Thanks for the tips! Let me go check that out!!,btohqsg
Anyone gotten their amex $200 paynow singsaver promo from April?,btohqsg
For Chris 1st class suits video  it cost him 58500 miles = $6365.20.That’s makes the valuation of a miles be 10.88 cpm (636520/58500)Does it makes sense to pay for the annual credit card fees  worth 1.92 cpm in order to secure another 1st class ticket?That’s like paying approximately $1.1k for a 1st class ticket..?,btohqsg
Why paying annual fee when you can waive? And you also have option to use cardup to buy miles at less cost.,btohqsg
Cause it’s cheaper to buy another 1st class ticket directly no?Like people normally would pay $1k for economy ticket. But instead this $1k can get us a 1st class ticket nowIndirectly per se,btohqsg
Your reason didn't answer my questions,btohqsg
Using cardup is paying for miles at 1.3cpm -1.6cpm (depending on what cards you have and what you are paying). Paying AF at 1.92cpm is ok for first class redemption but I wouldn't do it unless I exhaust other buying miles options.,btohqsg
Oh I’m not very familiar with card up. My bad,btohqsg
Interesting  so yea if card up is indeed cheaper  then it makes sense to waive it I guess,btohqsg
Hi all experts  in the current climate  to pay a 20k AIA insurance premium for the following annual payment (end of the month due) what is the best method?,btohqsg

Cos mcc not changedJust confirming my understanding. Thank u,btohqsg
Is StarHub in store purchase a qualifying spend for hsbc live credit card?,btohqsg
Both should be fine.1. For SQ site  mcc is only for SQ so you are good.2. For Expedia  ur transaction description matters. Shopback/Heymax doesn't change description so you are good too.,btohqsg
Thx.. Dun have this now.. Wonder will get it in time anot lol,btohqsg

Only specific card have specific admin fees?And I have to chose the card with lowest admin fees and highest mpd?,btohqsg
Yes go see the promo code for different card,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
Why won’t card up earn 4mpd  even tho it’s online spend? Isit because  the mcc not under the list of online mcc?,btohqsg
U only earn base miles for cardup. If not bank will lose money if so easy can get 4mpd,btohqsg
Hi All  can I check in order to redeem miles for Singapore Airline  do I need to have at least 50% of the miles? Thanks!,btohqsg

Sq miles top up is expensive,btohqsg
got alternative way to top up?,btohqsg
U can try buy transfer miles from other but not cheap too haha,btohqsg
Top up is not worth it. U might as well pay full fare and save enough miles to redeem a subsequent flight,btohqsg

Did u consider mixing miles and cash for your air tix or transfer to KrisPay ? I use this method for my expiring miles that I can't utilise for award ticket and class upgrade,btohqsg
Bumping up my own question again.. Anyone here can advise  please ? Appreciate 😊,btohqsg
But i have 150k of cash with ocbc and a house loan with it,btohqsg
Then ocbc will give you at least 4.65% of interest for $150k of saving with min $500 spending on card n salary credit provided you have $500 incremental of saving per month.,btohqsg
I hope they are able to waive off as they earn from me a lot in my house loan,btohqsg
Credit card department is different from others and they work independently,btohqsg
PSA: Those who did the buy $500 get $50 Capita voucher promo in May 2024  your $50 bonus vouchers are expiring these few days. Please go check. I noticed the vouchers are now no longer sorted by Date of Expiry.,btohqsg
Yes. So u can get points for forex using amaze and bonus points for crcm.,btohqsg
If they refuse to  can I cancel and not pay the charges?,btohqsg
They should be able to waive it. Believe it by faith first then do the needful.The system decides based on business rules which we dun know anything about. Better to call CSO and ask CSO to put up manual request. Inform the CSO that u r prepared to cancel the card if u r charged annual fees.,btohqsg
My recent list of high interest deposit:1 uob one 4% at 150k with salary and spend 5002 ocbc 360 4.6% at 100k with salary save and spend 5003 slashaway fixed deposit 3 month 3.65%4 hsbc ega 1% + 3.65%Above are all bank deposit accountInterestingly recent t bill failed to 3.4% ... not sure will keep dropping or not.,btohqsg
@mttelegrammtmay I ask but for hsbc ega transfer 360k u can't do it in 1 day so there is always a part of the fund are not incremental / fresh funds anymore isn't so I thought only 200k below maybe can do it every month clean,btohqsg
do everything in advance. Start transferring out earlier.make sure you end up with minimum amount in your HSBC EGA when month end closes.,btohqsg

do the SGD10 spend one.. much much easier,btohqsg
Thanks! Means spend SGD10 from wallet i assume?,btohqsg
i never thought it is wise to use Amaze wallet  but up to you.i would use Amaze linked to a Credit Card that earns good rewards,btohqsg
My friend spent $1000 this month using amaze linked to citi rewards already. But status still awaiting for first transfer,btohqsg
is your friend $1000 transaction an excluded one?,btohqsg
What do you mean excluded one?,btohqsg
Thanks for the help so far! 🙏🏻 appreciated,btohqsg
Oh. Not in the exclusion list. She spent $1000 on furnitures,btohqsg
then should have met the requirements and both of you receive the referral Instapoints.,btohqsg

If i am not wrong  this one only can get after sending money overseas.,btohqsg
I paid through kris+ tho. Those 1mpd form the app is in but the other 3mpd from the card it self is not in,btohqsg
You read tnc what is the definition of fresh fund? I don’t think this qualifies,btohqsg
Yea UOB statement also doesn’t show I’m awarded any points on kris+ payment,btohqsg
Have you check your Krisflyer account? Mine was credited directly into my Krisflyer account,btohqsg
Yes.  I didn’t even get the welcome bonus too.The statement does shows kris+ at the front of each payment,btohqsg
1.8 will only be in till your next anniversary month to pay annual fee😂 plus you need to spend on sq group charged directly to the card. 1.2 will be in by next statement around there.,btohqsg
I’m expecting over 40k miles to be in as I paid via kris+ app,btohqsg
Ah ok. Maybe it is processed in batches. Mine matches with my calculation (which includes the 3mpd for Kris+ transactions and 1.2mpd for all others)  though the bonus 5k miles is not reflected yet.,btohqsg
Haha maybe too big amount need second level Checks,btohqsg
Which app is this image taken from?,btohqsg
Doesn’t makes sense lei  the statement is already out,btohqsg
Oh. I didnt know kris+ is straight 3 miles. I thought have to wait 1 year for it😂 learnt something new.,btohqsg
SIA group (plus Kris+) awards 3 direct.,btohqsg
Can I check you with your UOB estatment reflects the miles ?,btohqsg
Haha yeah… too many TnCs to read and understand. Basically SIA Group and Kris+ transactions gives 3mpd direct. Everything else under the accelerated earn rate of 1.8mpd can be up to 14 months later,btohqsg
Nope it does not reflect in UOB statement. It reflect under Krisflyer account.,btohqsg
Yes  3mpd on online selected MCCs assuming u spent at least $800 on SIA/Scoot/KrisShop (excl. Kris+),btohqsg
By Krisflyer account  do you mean the sgair app?,btohqsg
Yes. Krisflyer UOB miles earn goes direct to Krisflyer account (check Singapore Air App) and does not reflect as UNI$,btohqsg
Yea the miles not in the app,btohqsg
krisflyer account is where the krisflyer goes to  Singapore Air app is where u can see the miles in the account and redeem for flight,btohqsg
I angry. I did on 31 July. Counted as August spend. So I’m done Liao,btohqsg
Yeah. But my July $600 was counted for August cycle so I don’t need spend in August Liao,btohqsg
Don’t know what they mean sia..That’s means miles only credited 2 months later??,btohqsg
Calm down a little. Give it a few more days. My KF also not in yet.,btohqsg
So it’s it’s always 2 months later I guess?,btohqsg
No. My spend for that month will get credited next month. I got ranging from 4-7th day of the month.,btohqsg
But your statement won’t reflect it?,btohqsg
people answered you before. it will show in Krisflyer statement.,btohqsg
This is how it showed up in my uob statement. I got 108 KF miles inJulyJune.,btohqsg
I supposed it does not reflect immediately but next month statement  since the miles are credited after the statement is generated? Hence the CSO mentioning it will be reflected in the following month statement. Trying to understand too as it is not in my UOB statement,btohqsg
Ah my bad. 108 is from june spend. And it showed up in july statement.,btohqsg
Ah ok so statement wise is 2 months,btohqsg
Yes. Miles will happen earlier. My 108 June miles were credited last 4 July. And miles for july havent not been credited yet.,btohqsg
Shld get it today or tmr. I got mine today.,btohqsg
should i use OCBC 360 account if i credit my salaray and save without spending?,btohqsg
Lol. Mine just showed up in KF statement today. And it said it was credited on 3 aug. :),btohqsg
Wow today a sea of Red🫨,btohqsg
ya loh.. this time i kenna loh..i had nothing to spend on.. then realised can pay chan brother.. and it was 31 july when i had that eureka moment.. at first wanted to skip the promo,btohqsg
Haha going against your own rules,btohqsg
and i did go read TNC loh..it said BASED ON TRANSACTION DATE..oh well.. didn't want to go argue with Ezlink customer service.. so i just left it la...,btohqsg
"i mean ok loh... i will still get $60 cashback in August for the $600 i spent on 31st July...won't really say i 'lost' $60.... just unable to participate in both cycles lohif anything it is ""4%"" loss only.. whatever i cannot prepay for my chan brothers i going to use Kris+ UOB KF at 4mpd anyway",btohqsg

only SNACK excluded from what i heard,btohqsg
I received mine today. I didnt use the card at all for july and i got 1000 over points and my statment cycle is to follow the calendar month. So I guess there is really some form of delay in crediting the points?Omg. I have been using this card for the 6th year. Alot of things i just found out today😂😂😂,btohqsg
Mine just got updated but date shows 3 Aug haha,btohqsg
Hey guys  quick question. For the OCBC 360 account  is the credit card spending criteria (>$500) calculated base on calendar month or the statement date?,btohqsg
Ocbc credit card don't have a spending tracker like UOB 🫠,btohqsg
Any more promo for ocbc credit card?,btohqsg
It does tell you how much you spent in total each calendar month  isnt that enough?,btohqsg
But with 30 days funds cannot withdraw this cannot withdraw earlier within the month already,btohqsg
It says cannot use funds u withdrew 30 days ago. Not the fund must stay 30 days,btohqsg
May I ask how can I find my uob one account monthly average balance of current month please,btohqsg
Oh yea but I only see july now not August.,btohqsg
I have an electric oven Cornell brand to let go of. Pick up at Bt Batok,btohqsg

hi shi fu around im looking to buy some air tickets and hotel bookings for my upcoming trip.can i seek advise on the best cards out there for 2-3k related travel spending? (open to both miles and cashback action),btohqsg
that is mobile contactless  get 10x points for anything not in exclusion list.For online (via metchant website/app) only the selected MCC gets 10x points. E.g. Fairprice website is under supermarket mcc and online  so get 10x points,btohqsg
For ocbc 365 account  can salary credit be via paynow?,btohqsg

Hi experts  My UOB one supplementary card’s spendings are grouped as “SUPPLEMENTARY RETAIL” to the principal card’s statement. So I am assuming that supplementary card spending would not get additional 5% cashback from the specific merchants?,btohqsg
Doesn't work  I tried before. Only corporate account is counted,btohqsg
Got it. Thanks for the prompt reply! Appreciated! 🙏,btohqsg
Will get. Same as main holder transactions.,btohqsg
any worth while credit card promo currently to get rewards?got some air tickets to purchase (Looking at $2-3k spending),btohqsg
Thank you! Because all spending on it has been grouped to one category on the main statement  I thought it only qualifies for the 3.33% but not the additional 5%. Thank you for clarifying :),btohqsg

It's a 1.68% p.a. boost  may not get 5% p.a. if yield of fullerton sgd cash fund drops significantly over the 30 days.,btohqsg
i have completed hsbc everyday+ criteria start of the month but still haven’t received the confirmation sms - can anyone advise pls?,btohqsg

You need to start a company and open a corporate bank account. Alternatively you can get your HR to credit salary to your OCBC 360 account instead.,btohqsg

hey  I would like to ask if is citi premier the best general spend card for my use case? I use it for cardup payments (insurance  rent)  large ticket spend and when i exceed 1k on citi rewardsam considering the uob prvi miles but scared i'm unable to accumulate enough uob$ for miles redemption,btohqsg
Are you getting it bcuz non expiring miles?,btohqsg
Consider dbs altitude. Citi premier miles has worse miles earn rate and higher cardup fee.Uob prvi aint too bad if you have other uob cards. You will earn enough to redeem before the expiry.,btohqsg
Hi can check with you how long did you wait before receiving this message? I submitted last Sat. Until now still no response yet.,btohqsg
This is the 1% and the Rewards program (NOT THE BONUS INTEREST)There is no need to submit anything.,btohqsg

OCBC Salary Save Spend only earn 394.94 apparently,btohqsg
Seems correct assuming you have 100k. Though it may not make sense to keep 100k in ocbc due to reset month.,btohqsg
One of the best accounts now. Just behind HSBC EGA,btohqsg
"Could u elaborate what you mean about this ""reset month""?",btohqsg
If you check out the table in the orginal#ocbc360eirmessage  there's a range of ideal amounts your MAB should be at. And there'll be a reset month required to stay within the range.,btohqsg
Any recommendations to transfer the 100k out to if it does not make sense to keep in ocbc?,btohqsg
Dont need to take out the entire 100k. Look at#ocbc360eirby admin Melvyn for a range of ideal MAB. Just withdraw to stay within the range.,btohqsg
Does UOB privi have a  spending cap on foreign currency purchase?,btohqsg
Isit better to get the master card version and pair it with Amaze?,btohqsg
Not really. Pairing master ver with amaze doesnt earn u anymore values. Amaze is best paired with 4mpd/3mpd cards. Imo  uob prvi visa is best as its highest mpd card for cardup.,btohqsg
What about overseas spend? It helps to convert to reduce fx right?  and earn uncapped 2.4mpd overseas,btohqsg
This is where u got wrong. Amaze converted overseas to local spend so you only get 1.4mpd. Not worth paying amaze spread for that.,btohqsg
Ohh so for overseas spend… amaze +crmc is still the best choices cause of the lower fx fees + 4mpd (but not uncapped)?,btohqsg
Hihi  sorry I'm pretty new to credit cards  what's cardup? How does that work with uob prvi visa?,btohqsg
For mile earning purpose yes. If you are expecting to go over 1k limit when spending overseas  consider adding UOB lady (esp dining) to ur collection. UOB lady can be paired w amaze and avoid hitting cap on crmc.,btohqsg
TLDW: a way to pay for expenses that are usually not valid for credit card rewards (with a fee). Visa usually has lower fee.,btohqsg
"So average of 60 days return could only be (5+3.8)/2~4.4 % (maximum)?Realised they don't use the word ""guaranteed"" anymore.",btohqsg
I’m thinking more of a cheap way to buy miles actually.Any success stories of people converting from lady’s to solitaire without the 120k criteria?,btohqsg
Don’t quote me but I think I saw on milelion that if you apply for UOB solitaire on SMS  got chance to approve even if don’t meet 120k,btohqsg
Is this the incremental of 500 per month as required by OCBC?,btohqsg
What's the key diff between these two,btohqsg
I was following milelion chat and there are dp of successful getting lady sol for people with 80-90k but it was like 1-2 months ago. UOB kept changing their system. But no harm to try applying.,btohqsg

Because in overseas is under foreign currency  and does foreign currency is still eligible for 4mpd?,btohqsg

UOB no need to do real salary crediting. You just transfer from another account into UOB account and put 'salary payment' as reason . Will be considered salary credit for the higher interest,btohqsg

Easy but costlier or cheaper but advanced  choose 1 of 2,btohqsg
So if I'm a existing moomoo user and want to join this promo  I should do this?-I should withdraw my money-Register the promo-Transfer back the money-Keep the money for 2months,btohqsg
Hi if i pair my amaze with my citi cc. Can i use my amaze card to do paynow transaction to collect miles point?,btohqsg
How u using amaze to do paynow?,btohqsg
oh sorry typo  i mean paywave payment. could i use amaze for paywave payment?,btohqsg
Don’t think so cause there’s a monthly and quarterly min spend criteria,btohqsg
Citi Cash Back MC seems to be the closest equivalent(?) to this in that case,btohqsg
1). Have you read the TnC?2). Do you know what is the effective interest rate? (Not the advertised rate).3). Have you calculated your incremental fund based on closing balance on 05 Aug  10pm?,btohqsg
I just check its not a cashback cardIt’s legit a Citi platinum Mastercard,btohqsg
Just test with other browser have same issue,btohqsg
Only Rewards tab not loading  all others are okay,btohqsg
Oh i was checking stack rewards,btohqsg

Hi  does anyone knows when you pay via atome does it based on the merchant mcc or atome mcc?,btohqsg
I believe Krisflyer doesn’t allow us to add a Krisflyer account to a credit card that is a different name right?,btohqsg
How soon can we pay the annual fees for HSBC T1 annual fees upon getting the card?,btohqsg
Hi Gurus  will there be any difference in the 4mpd reward if i use amaze+crmc in fairprice app to pay in kopitiam vs using crmc directly in the fairprice app?.,btohqsg
should appear in statement within 90 days,btohqsg
So it will automatically add to our statement  and we have to hold for a minimum of 3 months before cancelling it?,btohqsg
yes auto added to statement. dun remember if TnC states need to keep how long before cancel but at least wait till u get the bonus points and redeemed them?,btohqsg

Hi guys  can someone pls enlighten me if I have multiple UOB cards  do they follow the same statement cycle? Or varies for diff card?,btohqsg

Anyone here bought SCHG? is it better than QQQ?,btohqsg
Which joint account have the highest interest rate,btohqsg
Would it be wise to treat moomoo as an savings account? I was thinking of putting in a third of my liquid funds into it so it'll collect interest,btohqsg
cardup mcc code is 7399 right? I saw Citibank and UOB does not excluded this MCC  mean can get miles?,btohqsg
Yes and you get base miles.,btohqsg
No. Don’t think your fund is protected if moo moo closed down. Put in those you can afford to lose,btohqsg
okay  looks like issue with ocbc website,btohqsg
my uob statement date is on 2nd  is this mean UNI$ earned is until 1st or 2nd of trans posting date?,btohqsg
"""If your holdings are US stocks  you should be covered by SIPC too (says so on the Moomoo dot com slash sg page). For SG stocks  under their MAS license as a custodian broker  I believe that your stocks will be transferred to another custodian  or maybe you pay a fee to transfer them to CDP. Funds (unit trusts) should be covered as well.""",btohqsg
So your understanding that Moomoo fund is as secure as SG bank account that is insured by SDIC under up to 100k? There is a difference. From their page “It is important to understand that SIPC protects customer accounts against losses caused by the financial failure of the broker-dealer  but not against an increase or decrease in the market value of securities in customers' accounts. SIPC does not protect against market risk  which is the risk inherent in a fluctuating market.”,btohqsg
Wondering anyone tried? Ntuc inapp payment under dbs women card. Is it 4 miles per $? 😂,btohqsg
"the person i replied to said that the fund is not protected if moomoo close down. Which the original poster probably is talking ""interest"" in terms of moomoo cash plus funds",btohqsg
Then follow calendar month. Doesn't matter what is ur statement date.,btohqsg
Ok  so 1-30 or 31 of posting date,btohqsg
But max 2000$ is based on statement month of posting date  so for mine is 3rd to 2nd  is that correct?,btohqsg
You can consider aligning ur statement month to calendar mth. Easier to track..,btohqsg
I asked before and cso give me the new statement date on 2nd  which I think not too far from month end.,btohqsg
Oh that's odd. My UOB cso gave me month end.,btohqsg
I think the point about custodian and how the customer investment is protected is not verifiable. The brokers don’t go into details on how in such events  that the customers can claim back and if it will be 100% of their investments. So from my point of view  the protection is there to some degree but not total. But I guess each of us have different levels of interpretation. Main thing when one invest in these funds  they need to know what are they investing into with the pros and cons. Good to discuss our thoughts,btohqsg
but if customers cant really claim back if the company goes under   then whats the point of custodian account? why not just the broker hold all the customer's money?But i cant give a clear answer also   never been through any broker going bankrupt,btohqsg
You hit the answer. It has not tested or verified by a third party unlike SDIC which is from MAS and not by the banks themselves. So that why I have higher confidence if a bank really goes down  we can get back our deposit. For these brokers  it is more of “I do  I say but who verify”. As much saving account does not offer attractive interest rate  they are still important as part of our financial planning. I definitely won’t put my emergency funds into these funds not even the MMF. But spare cash  yes  I willing to put in these funds for higher interest.,btohqsg
Yup legit. But it's not cash u can redeem. It's like PayPal credit  subway credit etc. Not many choices. And in blocks it 5000 points redeem for $25 worth of credits,btohqsg
Hi guys  I was wondering if anyone have tried using atome fortrip.comand pay using citi rewards card on atome. Does this qualify for the 4 MPD? 🤔,btohqsg
Tried Atome + CRMC  but not ontrip.com. It works.,btohqsg
Should be similar for others as Atome uses its own MCC. Try to manually make payment from Atome. Do not let it deduct automatically  heard it might treat it as GIRO for automatic installments payment.,btohqsg
MCC 5999  eligible for 4mpd for CRMC.,btohqsg
I tried transfer $1600 from my DBS Account to paynow NRIC which is linked to my UOB one Account  and put Salary Payment as remark  But it did not satisfy the UOB one Account Salary Credit condition.,btohqsg
Try fast transfer from dbs with salary purpose?,btohqsg
Hi I am trying to weight between Citi signup bonus for 40000 thank you points vs sing saver 300 PayNow+150 Shopee voucher. Does anyone have a value comparison on how the thank you points can be valued at ?,btohqsg
40k tk pts are 16k miles. Avg value is 1.1c to 1.25c per mile. I feel singsaver offer is superior.,btohqsg
But if going for business or 1st class  won’t the miles be more worth it?Each mile would be otherwise valued at 5-8cpm if 1st class,btohqsg
16k miles for 450$ is 2.81cpm. And you can pay annual fee for many cards at 1.9cpm. and other options like cardup for 1.4-1.7 cpm. Would u want to do this instead?,btohqsg
I believe 16k for $450 is not exactly right as we are not “buying it” for $450.Both are free welcome offer.So if the person value business class or 1st ticket more then an economy  that means he/she prolly value miles at 5-8cpm.Let’s take 5cpm for example  that would means 16k *$0.05 = $800 return from the miles which is more then the total value of $450 from singsaver.,btohqsg
Correct me if I’m wrong. I’m still learning as well,btohqsg
You can get 16k miles at lower cost than 2.81 cpm  i.e. paying annual fee  using cardup  ipaymy. Even buying directly from uob payment facility at 2.1 cpm,btohqsg
Ik and I’m saying it’s not 2.81Cause he/she is not buying any miles here,btohqsg
The guy have an option to choose between 16kmiles vs $450That’s like choosing between a cashback card or a miles cardAnd so if he value business class more then it makes sense that the miles reward is better,btohqsg
"By getting 16k miles  you are losing out 450 cash value. Hence  equivalent to ""buying"" 16k miles at 450$. People could ""buy"" 10k miles at 196$ annual fee and not many do that. It's terrible value.",btohqsg
And you gotta redeem suites/first class to value a mile more than 2.81 cents.,btohqsg
Are there any extra charges if i invest via RSP with my bank account instead of universal acocunt on moomoo?,btohqsg
Is the new Moomoo Cash Plus 6.8% Existing User Promo worth it?https://www.honeymoneysg.com/post/review-moomoo-sg-cash-plus-existing-user-6-8-p-a-promotionReference to earlier post:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/224367👉 Discuss morehttps://t.me/honeymoneysg👉 More referralhttps://t.me/sgpromocode,btohqsg

No  in fact it is much more convenient,btohqsg
Anyone here tried porting over from zym mobile to gomo esim?,btohqsg
Hi ! If let’s say after I inject fresh funds  can I use the some of the fresh funds to buy stocks and still be eligible for the promotion ?,btohqsg
Yes  as long as you meet the fresh funds requirement,btohqsg
5-8cpm is the equivalent mathematical value/cost  but the important factor is worth  i.e. how much would one have paid for that same ticket in cash.,btohqsg
So I tried porting over since sunday night and received an sms says that it will be ported over at 2am. Till now I am still not connected to gomo network,btohqsg
Gomo CSO said it will be resolve with 24-48 hours. everytime I check they keep gaslighting me saying need another 24-48 hours. So yah  wanted to check if anyone had an issue like this before,btohqsg
Mine took an hour that's all,btohqsg
dayum. Mine was supposed to be done within a few hours too according to the sms. That's why I am puzzled why am I not connected till now,btohqsg
Tried using atome and hsbc rev and worked. So the same logic should applied to citi too.,btohqsg
By overvalue  u mean taking into account how much we are willing to pay for a ticket as opposed to the actual ticket ah?,btohqsg
No  it means how much cpm banks are willing to sell you miles at (for a profit!). And yet some value their own miles higher than bankshttps://youtu.be/faKTziNGHGI?si=2E4lnC3Hbcy0Iw3R,btohqsg

Hi guys  does OCBC 360 account not make sense for someone who invests a few $k every 2 months? Since it’s hard to get the 1.2%Savebonus due to that  so only 2% fromSalary. Or is there some trick to go around this?,btohqsg
It's best for those who not touching the monies  except to withdraw the salary and bonus interest  keeping +$500 MAB.,btohqsg
Can you increase ur balance 500 every month? (A bit more to be safe). Any extra amount can keep in those fuss free saving account like Maribank. Then take from there every 2 months for investment.,btohqsg
