Wah actually this is a good question sia... It depends leh. Let's say if your gahmen is Keynesian and want to spend to boost GDP and employment  and if you need to import many many things  then shipping by right should huat.However gahmen expenditure usually means stuff like roads  bridges etc  and not where imported items are combined to form one product for re-export... so container ships may return to Port of Origin empty.So recovery of shipping (two-way traffic) only will happen in the medium term as people get money from the gahmen to spend on consumer goods etc. But short term shipping shld be less I suppose.,btohqsg
Actually best is just buy SBS transit and hold until die...,btohqsg
Dun forgot some commodity is still needed to ship,btohqsg
Samudera low PE co  can go further high🙈🙊,btohqsg

Gahmen will help by increasing max fares under PTC,btohqsg
Because the gahmen of the day need serve ppl by keeping fares affordable  yet they cannot let their Temasek-held stocks toh suddenlyb,btohqsg
So in the end? Subsidise or increase fares  give transport vouchers  and its just one whole merry go round but overall price level increase and remain in equilibrium,btohqsg
"Subsidise is ""as and when""  but the increase it permanent. Same as GST  once it goes up  it will ONLY continue to go up but  will NEVER come down ",btohqsg
I wonder if otter taste nice or not...,btohqsg
Still waiting for SMM subsidies  been holding since $1.00,btohqsg
Actually the lower and middle income benefit more from gahmen services than the taxes they pay... If you want I can go and find the graph.But I interviewed at MOF Tax Directorate and I also chao kuan them say GST raise is not good because there's a socially acceptable limit how much you can raise. Shld look at other ways to either diversify (eg defence tax for ppl who don't serve NS) or reduce tax relief (eg NSMen tax relief for females),btohqsg
