If I change into SGD   then change again to USD. The difference in exchange rate is 1%,btohqsg
Thanks for the info. I am looking for cost effective way to convert. 1% for converting small amount is still ok. For converting big sums  1% will cost a lot.,btohqsg
Sorry can I check. The points are based on posting date? Or transaction date? Because for this month I haven‚Äôt spent $600 yet. Wondering if today I make a purchase can hit $600 for next month and get all the relevant points instead. Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Especially it's 1% loss of the Total assets,btohqsg
Hi all I‚Äôll purchasing toilet accessories  lights  furnitures etc for my new home at a shop in Geylang.Currently I only have citi rewards + amaze to pay $1k monthly for $10k quotation.Is there any card that i can use or should sign up to increase my monthly payable?,btohqsg
Would anyone if there are any offers to open a bank account with DBS or posb now?,btohqsg
Hey all  I can't seem to find Tiger Vault 6.8% deal in the app. Is it expired already?,btohqsg
Wow awesome news. Can I confirm this is for all DBS cards? I can see how I can charge a bunch of things on the last 2 days on the card and get a long interest free credit term as it will only be posted on the next statement and I get another 20 days on it.,btohqsg
Cc charges usually full period is 50 plus day before payment  just need to know when they renew statement cycle,btohqsg
I have other bank cards and they usually only count when it is posted so not useful when it comes to clocking in the spend.If DBS takes transaction date  can try to stretch the credit out üòÇ,btohqsg
Thank you so much for this lobang,btohqsg
There is no lobang  just a fact,btohqsg
Do you all think it worth closing HSBC everyday global account ? Or people still worth keeping for the giro 1% ?,btohqsg
Why close? It's one of the best you can get.,btohqsg
Okay thanks  stop using it after closing all my HSBC cc üòÖ,btohqsg
No link tho.. unless you really need that 1% cashback on cc. Which they might anytime end.,btohqsg
Oh my. One of the best cards now is HSBC live+,btohqsg
I dun bother on the cc. Just milk the ega lol,btohqsg

Hi  would like to ask if there is a limit amount for paywave on UOB cards in a single transaction via:1. Physical card2. Contactless payment,btohqsg
As far as I know  no.Edit: Up to credit limit assigned by the bank.,btohqsg
If the shop allows paywave  consider UOB Visa signature and preferred platinum visa. If you are new to uob  apply for UOB prvi for sign up bonus.,btohqsg
Those are initial suggestions. Plz read more about them,btohqsg
Thank you for your recommendation! Am reading up on UOB signature already! üôèüèª,btohqsg
