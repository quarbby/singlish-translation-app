Tai Hua.. not worth. Usually noodles overcooked or clumped together... Spoils the taste.p,btohqsg
Keyboard warrior trying to be a playboy... lol,btohqsg
Taihua usually fail my standards for noodles...,btohqsg
If I want overcooked noodles I ownself cook also can get 🤣😂,btohqsg
Actually the real tai Hwa no outlet one,btohqsg
The outlet one is the one at Hong Lim  but not from original,btohqsg
I think it’s some relative but they not on good terms,btohqsg
Had lawsuit over the Tai Hwa name. But judge rule that the name is not exclusive,btohqsg
So this is fake one ar,btohqsg
It is not from the Crawford lane one. That’s the OG. But the so called branch at Hong Lim did win Michelin bib but it sucks,btohqsg
Dun get deceived by the name and michelin thingy,btohqsg

I think u ownself cook taste better,btohqsg
A lot get award Liao then become bad,btohqsg
The Bangkok crab omelette.. before Michelin she sell one for 500 baht. After Michelin increased to 1000 baht  and now it’s 1400 baht,btohqsg
A lot of stalls once got fame then standard will drop,btohqsg
Chicken rice also Michelin also not nice.,btohqsg
I very thirsty. Got sugar rush today. Maybe cycle too hard today.,btohqsg
I dunno leh I see the price I turned off,btohqsg
