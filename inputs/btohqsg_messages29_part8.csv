Wah.. dammit.. thought I had done my HFE but I didn't checked..Now don't have a valid HFE to apply for SBF..FML..,btohqsg
During the point of application right?,btohqsg
Hey folks  might be a dumb question  but in the event we get a queue number for sbf  and we select a unit that is ready for key collection  but we're not married yet  would that be okay?the earliest ROM date is August for instance,btohqsg
Case by case. Hdb will give a timeline within 6mths to a year to settle down.,btohqsg
Hi  is there any group for Kovan Wellspring,btohqsg
Can i ask... The penalty of not choosing a sbf unit when > 5 available  this penalty only kick in if we meet the requirements right? Means if got eg 8 units but the lease not long enough to cover until i 95  i won't be penalised right,btohqsg
N 2nd qn.. this > 5  is for the whole area or just each project,btohqsg
Oh this is a good question… Try calling into HDB to ask and let me know their reply can?,btohqsg
Should be for whole district cause SBF allows you to select from a wider selection pool of units in a town.,btohqsg
Are there real life models of the bto projects available for us to check out?,btohqsg
Have but only available during flat selection. It will also be posted in your HDB flat application page,btohqsg
I meant like the whole layout of the project. Not individual rooms to gauge how close a certain unit is to the carpark etc,btohqsg
hi guys   how and where do i toggle to see these informations,btohqsg
Like the whole surrounding of the bto? They only show you the bto project though…,btohqsg
Does anyone know where I can find the floor layout for the listing's on SBF?,btohqsg
Need to search for the project bto launch name and find the brochurehttps://t.me/btoapptdates,btohqsg
How is the application rate calculated? E.g. above there are 6 flats  5 applicants. How come first timer rate is only 0.3 whereas the second timer is NA  shouldn't it be 5/6 = 0.8 instead?,btohqsg
can you send the first grp link? i cant find,btohqsg
When is the result for sbf q number?,btohqsg
6 weeks from application end date,btohqsg
Usually how long does HFE letter takes to get approved?,btohqsg
really depends on individual and no. of applications,btohqsg
How do u guys find the upcoming June 2025 Bto? For example the Sembawang one,btohqsg
Hiii  wanna ask  if I apply for SBF (example Bedok)  is it apply the whole estate of bedok including the ones that is completed? Like we’ll be applying for units listed as SBF tat are completed and still building?,btohqsg
Even if the unit I want is the ongoing project and nt the one tat has keys ready for collection?,btohqsg
Yes. You're balloting for units in an estate  not for individual projects within the estate,btohqsg
depends on your queue position. if queue number infront can have more choices. if queue at the end only can pick the leftovers,btohqsg
If you get a queue number  then you can pick whichever you want that's available to you  whether it's completed or not,btohqsg
