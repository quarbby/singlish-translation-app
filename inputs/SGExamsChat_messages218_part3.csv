we didnt ask r/sg to put us in the sidebar cause there were other priorities,btohqsg

I'm not one of them but mad respect,btohqsg
Yea majoring in Asian studies require some kind of commitment and passion but like as somebody from outside clearing basket or taking UEs got fun mods one,btohqsg

No such subject called Asian studies as of right now,btohqsg
I still don't know wtheck they mean by integrated humanities  integrated social sciences,btohqsg
because according to the talk  the exposure mod for major and the common core are 2 diff things,btohqsg
Asian studies is the amalgamation of the department the of SEA  SA  Japanese  Chinese  Malay studies  unless they actually create a general Asian studies mod you still can choose.,btohqsg
