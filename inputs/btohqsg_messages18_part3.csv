Hello just wanna ask  for first timer couples to be considered under first timer (Parents and married couple)  what if 1 partner is above 40yo and the other is below 40yo?https://dollarsandsense.sg/latest-changes-bto-ballot-priority-scheme-first-timer-families-will-get-better-chance-getting-bto-flats/,btohqsg
Hello everyone  wanna ask about bto ballot chances for first timers and how it works.I understand under the new hdb rules  first timer families can get up to 3 times ballot chances.How does it work? That means if first time fail  can reapply for next bto launch?,btohqsg
it clearly says if u are a parent/married couple  u get 3 chances. Otherwise u only get 2,btohqsg
unrelated to whether u can reapply for next bto launch or not.,btohqsg
u can always apply for more than 1 launch  given that u haven‚Äôt selected a unit yetfrom august onwards  if u have a queue number  u have to select a unit  else you‚Äôll be demoted to second timer for a year  which means your chances of getting a q number in the next launch is lower.but u have waive the non selection count if there are less than 10 units left or smthhowever  if u have a q number  but didn‚Äôt manage to select a unit (ethnic quota reached or units all selected)  u will still be a first timer in the next launch,btohqsg
Thanks for the information. I'm still abit confused about the 2 or 3 chances.,btohqsg
Is it when ur first time ballot fails  can ballot another 1-2 times until get a number in 1 bto exercise?,btohqsg
u can ballot as many times u want  as long as u haven‚Äôt selected a unit,btohqsg
so if you‚Äôre lucky (or unlucky) enough  u can hold multiple q numbers (unlucky because it means your q numbers are all ‚Äòbad‚Äô),btohqsg
basically yes  just ballot until u get a q number. And even after u get a q number  u can still ballot for the next launch if u haven‚Äôt selected a unit for the previous launch. Which would mean u could hold 2 numbers at the same time if you‚Äôre lucky enough,btohqsg
I see thanks for sharing. I'm confused on how the whole system works as I've never done bto/sbf balloting b4.,btohqsg
the concept of 2 or 3 chances applies within the balloting process  it is not the number of times u can apply for a bto.if u are eligible for 3 chances  it simply means in the balloting process u have 1 more ballot chance as compared to other applicants who only have 2 ballot chances  so logically speaking there's a higher probability of u getting a better queue number,btohqsg
Thanks.Does it mean in 1 bto exercise get to ballot 2/3times if one fails to get a queue number within the first try?,btohqsg
No. 3 ballot chances means:  imagine that HDB does this process like a lucky draw  those whose names are picked will have a queue number. So  in 1 bto launch location  all applicant names are written on pieces of paper and put into 1 bowl; 3 ballot chances means there will be 3 pieces of paper with your name. So when HDB picks pieces of paper  theres a higher chance of your name being selected because you have more pieces of paper in the bowl. For example  if there are 100 pieces of paper in the bowl in total  3 pieces of paper = 3% chance of getting picked  as compared to 2 pieces of paper = 2% chance,btohqsg
the number of ballot chances u have is unrelated to whether u can apply for the next launch or not,btohqsg
u just have 3 chances to get a q number in THAT bto launch,btohqsg
and if u apply for the next launch under the same scheme  u also get 3 chances,btohqsg

Hello all  I would like to know if my partner and I are eligible for deferred income assessment or EHG. We were looking at the upcoming project for August 2023.This is because our status are as follows:Myself: 22 y/o (as of Aug 2023). Just completed undergraduate studies  not officially graduated by August 2023.Partner: 30 y/o (as of Aug 2023). Would have just worked 3 months in current job as of August 2023.I was reading up on DIA or EHG but there are many contradictory information online. I'm not sure if we can only consist of one student  or both have to be students - to be eligible for the DIA. Website says both have to be students  but I've heard from many that they could get it despite being 1 student + 1 working partner.Could someone please let me know if we are eligible for this and for EHG as well please. Thank you.,btohqsg
Thanks so much for replying! So we won't be available for the deferred income huh? :( thanks for your help though!So we wouldn't be eligible for the EHG in time for Aug 2023?Would we be eligible for any other possible grants? Thanks!,btohqsg
Actually it depend. For my case i‚Äôm currently studying and below 30 and my partner is working. I‚Äôm under deffered income.,btohqsg
Is better for you to check with HDB. Either you write in or call in to check.,btohqsg
I think you are referring to staggered downpayment scheme. It‚Äôs different from deferred income assessment.,btohqsg
For deferred income assessment  ‚ÄúBoth parties of a couple must:‚Ä¢ Be full-time students or National Servicemen (NSF); and/ or‚Ä¢ Have completed full-time studies or National Service (NS) within the last 12 months prior to the flat application.‚Äú,btohqsg
