Oil rises 1% as Fed rate cut optimism offsets demand fearshttps://ift.tt/JhZs03iJune 06  2024 at 06:26AM,btohqsg
🚀Pika World Breakfast Update - 6 June 2024🚀It's yet another record rally for the Nasdaq and S&P 500  supported by the sharp rise in Nvidia's shares. The chip company surpassed a valuation of $3 trillion  ahead of Apple's market capitalisation.🎲Recent data warms bet on Fed cuts.🥁The latest risk to sentiment in the equity market could be attributed to investors placing greater odds of a September rate cut  given recent weaker economic data on the US economy. Indeed  we are seeing downward pressure on disposable income  which fell 0.1% in April  marking the second decline seen in the prior three months.The savings rate also dipped to 3.6% in April and March  the lowest level seen since December 2022  which could reflect cooling consumer spending that fuels a large chunk of service inflation. Hence  it is a welcoming piece of data for the Fed.💰A Well-Balanced Goldilock Situation🗽Even as investors emphasize weaker growth as a positive sign  there are some green shoots in economic news. A fresh set of data from ISM showed Services MPI at 53.8%  which reflects the expansion of the services sector for 46 out of the last 48 months.Now  all eyes will be on Friday's morning job report for May  which is the market's biggest test of the week.📪What's on the menu today?📖At 8.30 pm  we will have the initial jobless claim. A further slowdown in the figure will be good news for the market.Likewise  the ECB will likely announce a rate cut by 25 basis points  which is the second central bank to cut rate after the BOC cut yesterday. This is welcoming  given the easing momentum globally.It is Thursday  June 6  at 8:50 a.m. in Singapore and 8:50 p.m. in New York. It is a sunny and warming morning. Aloha  and have a blissful day at work and in school.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
