Ah. Both car in the same lane,btohqsg
Usually this is see who want give way only,btohqsg
Its alr in merging lane alr,btohqsg
But is good practice to have left right left right go in from merging lane,btohqsg
Like that traffic will be smoother,btohqsg
I don’t want offend people but what I experienced most sg drivers are quite egotistical,btohqsg
If I give way to you I xiasuay,btohqsg

No right no wrong   give and take   who give way another person just take and thank the driver lor  if both die die wan take 50/50 side swipe only   bo hua de,btohqsg
Usually it's a left right left right in a merging lane but also can 1 give way to the other driver.You could have given way as well while that Golf could have given you the way since 'By Right' you should be next in line after the bus.I guess some drivers just want to overtake the others regardless  thinking that they may drive slow and hog the road ahead.,btohqsg
meanwhile here in thailand they just drive side by side on a 1 lane merger dc one,btohqsg
Can’t fight  they got more better driving experience,btohqsg
And I also don’t get why drivers so scared to go into yellow box at traffic lights  you are making a right turn  so is ok to stop in the yellow box,btohqsg
don't see y need scared as long as u following the rules,btohqsg
