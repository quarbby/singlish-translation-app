no life kids? more like easy A instead of studying chemical bonds until your eyes fall out and still getting a D,btohqsg
Kevin has broken up like glass against bedok’s hard malice,btohqsg
Hello what uni courses have yall gotten into? Curious,btohqsg
Yes  she is an amazing person,btohqsg
Why doesn't NUS office of admissions have a direct email which I can just email,btohqsg
Instead requiring me to sign up for an account to email them,btohqsg
apparently my home course is math but I want to change it to cs,btohqsg
Uk when ur teachers tell u to have a uni goal and work towards it,btohqsg
I worked hard to get into bie and once i got it,btohqsg
u love ur sch alot la,btohqsg
She meant u being demoted from admin,btohqsg
Whose clarity has gone to shit,btohqsg
Or is it the zoomer generation’s understanding,btohqsg
im sorry for being an idiot,btohqsg
Hey i gave an avenue for a comback,btohqsg
Fair game unlike some literature fella,btohqsg
You want what you can’t have,btohqsg
Thats literally how i started my sentence,btohqsg
I wonder how u pass lit,btohqsg
It had seemed as close as a star to the moon. Now it was again a uni course in Singapore. Your count of enchanted objects had diminished by one.,btohqsg
Count -= 1Or for 32bit systemsCount = Count - 1,btohqsg
I dont think thats a very good piece of code,btohqsg
Currently alive should just be a boolean value,btohqsg
I meant it to be a list of people,btohqsg
why is count -= 1 illegal for 32 bit systems?,btohqsg
I dont exactly know why. I did a question in an unconventional way so it doest make my processor into an oven,btohqsg
I ran the code got memory error,btohqsg
I ran again using count = count + 1,btohqsg
it's not illegal for 32 bit systems though,btohqsg
It just gives u memory error for 32bit system,btohqsg
I tried with list so maybe thatsbwhy,btohqsg
works just fine on a 32 bit vm,btohqsg
I have a potato for a comp,btohqsg
until your lecturers use some old ass version of ubuntu and asks you to do it in 32bit because the mem addresses change when you use other versions,btohqsg
easier to mark when the mem addr are the same,btohqsg
probably because the minus operator isn't overloaded for list? brb lemme check,btohqsg
but that shouldn't throw mem addr problem,btohqsg
it should just be type err or smth,btohqsg
Or maybe i should just follow suggested method,btohqsg
it's ok as long as you learn,btohqsg
Just change the dict = dict+ to dict +=,btohqsg
Ull get memory error for 32bit,btohqsg
He gets triggered by people who say math instead of maths,btohqsg
I applied for math and Cs,btohqsg
His math very good mah thatsbwhy,btohqsg
that algorithm is exponential wrt to the size of the input,btohqsg
32bit systems can only hold 4gb ram,btohqsg
maybe you put in too big a list,btohqsg
it's possible you ran out of space?,btohqsg
But it will work if u do dict = dict+,btohqsg
