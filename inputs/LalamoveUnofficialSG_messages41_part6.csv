Hi guys  can check if the drop off pt is restricted area  n price nvr include  do we contact Cs or tell the customer to include?,btohqsg
That's y even though llm say now don't need to call the customer after completing the job  I still call them everytime if there's tips involved. N i always check with them when I do the pickup. If they not sure  I will get them to cfm if its pay cash or credit b4 I pickup n goðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Maybe not foolproof  but so far touch wood nvr kena non payment yet,btohqsg
Most impt don't swipe cash collected. Swipe liao inform cs they will say can't do anytgðŸ™„,btohqsg
I kena b4  b4 take job it's listed as priority fee. Normally priority fee is instant credited. So I carry on do the job. Completed the job n cfm bill  showed up as tips to be collected. I blur,btohqsg
End up I nvr get the extra money,btohqsg
So now I always double check,btohqsg
Msg Cs after that they say cannot do anytgðŸ™„,btohqsg
This i not sure  wouldn't rule out system problem considering it's llmðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Making it that we have to settle any issues ourselves  then their back end just shake legðŸ˜•,btohqsg
the issue i encountered was when llm amending my order for waiting fee,btohqsg
Order with llm tips   after amending for waiting fee  they nv put back the tips they give,btohqsg
Ah yes. This 1 also must be careful,btohqsg
I accepted order   payout $21 bucks   after amending for waiting fees   payout still $21,btohqsg
3 different cs before it got sorted out,btohqsg
Lucky i screen shot the payout when i accepted,btohqsg
I kena b4  regarding the tips,btohqsg
Got 1 order  tips to be credited. Not cash. Customer use his llm coupons,btohqsg
Call him he double cfm he paid liao using e-wallet. Then I told the Cs. Then they say they will amend order. By right the tips is not to be deducted any commission. Ended up the amended order I get less  cos they included everything inside the main price.,btohqsg
From then on  I try to settle with customer instead of llm. Sometimes settle with llm  after everytg will kena charge a customer service renegotiation fee or something ðŸ™„,btohqsg
Llm cs is cb like tt,btohqsg
Please ask for purchasing fees   I just learnt yesterday,btohqsg
If customer or Cs doesn't want to include special fees  is it grounds for us to cancel the order without any penalty,btohqsg
Anyone took order from waacow before??,btohqsg
Yea the one at marina one,btohqsg
Their payment is alright  no issues,btohqsg
Did you received tips from them.,btohqsg
So far they use priority fee  not tips,btohqsg
