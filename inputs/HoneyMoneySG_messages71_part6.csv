How does the uob 2023 Christmas promotion works ? Anyone cares to explain in brief terms ?,btohqsg
hi all if you link the citi rewards card to amaze  and you pay using amaze  is it counted as qualifying spend for the singsaver rewards?,btohqsg
I also missed it üò•I didn‚Äôt know must empty only on 30 September.I thought can empty end of every month.,btohqsg
I think I think lah.Have to empty your fund on 30 September.Then bank in your fund on the next day.Then lock in the fund for 4 months.,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know where to put spare cash after 30 days at MooMoo money market fund‚Ä¶. ü§î,btohqsg

Can foreigners on work permit & s pass trade forex?,btohqsg
Should we do voluntary housing refund to cpf?,btohqsg
Hi  for long term saving does it make sense to put srs fund to money market fund like lionglobal sgd money market fund vs now ssb with near 3.32%,btohqsg
Only if you can't park the cash somewhere that will earn more than the cpf interest  but getting >2.5% p.a. with no/low risk is very easy to achieve currently.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if we can still do fast trf fromOcbc account to uob one account to meet salary requirements of uob? I dont see ‚Äúsalary payment‚Äù anymore in the category of the purpose of trf in ocbc,btohqsg
U could open another UOB stash account and put in spare cash to register for the UOB Christmas promo üòÅ,btohqsg
I can? Let me read more in detail..I have stash account‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Sad... Previously cap was 3k USD. Think that will come back next month?,btohqsg
Does it mean if i have a stash account  i can put in additional 50k  100k or 200k and i will get the cash amount at the end of the earmarked period and also i will earn the 3% interest each month?,btohqsg
yes  get cashback once funds earnarked. 3% is for 100k,btohqsg
+ the 3% in stashaccount or the 5% uob one interest each month?,btohqsg
usual effective 3% for $100k in stash account. $50k or $200k gets much lower effective interest,btohqsg
Are all these safe in car webull collapse?,btohqsg
did u empty out uob one account on 30 sep?,btohqsg
I have an existing stash account but min bal in there,btohqsg
Thinking to dep 100k into that and if possible open another stash account for another 100k deposit. Can earn 3% on both stash + 1500 cash. Not sure if that will work,btohqsg
Ya  but i want to maximise the interest in stash  max 100k else min interest if im depoaiting 200k,btohqsg
only one cashback on 1 account  cannot combine deposit in 2 accounts,btohqsg
Oh bummer  0.05% interest on the othr 100k if i deposit 200k into stash,btohqsg
better put 100k into another high interest account in another bank,btohqsg
Yeah my cash now in ocbc div+ so actually not much diff,btohqsg
anybody knows how standard chartered determines the 1 year period of whether you are a new customer? if you cancel card 10 Jan 2022 for eg.  are you considered a new customer on 11 Jan 2023 or only Feb 2023?,btohqsg
