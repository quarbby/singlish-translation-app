For the general masses just stick to what your car is rated for. Usually in the fuel cover there will show what RON your car is rated for.Unless your car is tuned to take only a certain octane and higher then will have to go with what your car is adjusted for.Modern car ECU can adapt to changes in fuel quality to be more efficient. But the threshold is usually what your car is minimally rated for. Going up usually will have very minor impact.,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice bro.. I will go for 95  if my engine piang bill you.. ü§£ü§£ü§£@xp_xp_xp,btohqsg
