Userjusamanhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:malicious intent,btohqsg
I disagree with advocating/instigating a bank run. But CF is not a bank  the only reason people put money in their money account is because of trust  trust that they will not run away with our money (since not SDIC insured).A lie about the CF card being blocked from use by AXS is a lie  and this erodes away the trust that users have in CF.They should have calculated their own risk before pulling a stunt like that to us.,btohqsg
Let's Talk About Chocolate Finance (CF)Preface:Since my video on 11 Dec 2024  I‚Äôve been transparent about not having funds in CF  as I found better alternatives with higher returns. Source:https://youtu.be/9SukDSNAzKo?si=wRFrZxBWQdhGKRFr&t=535Recently  there‚Äôs been some controversy surrounding CF. Let‚Äôs break down the facts.Timeline of Events* 5 Mar 2025 (Wed):  CF updated its FAQ  stating that AXS no longer accepts CF Debit Card payments. They were in discussions to resolve the issue.* 7 Mar 2025 (Fri):  Reports emerged that AXS clarified CF itself requested to halt payments  and AXS simply complied.* 9 Mar 2025 (Sun) ‚Äì Present:  Various creators shared their opinions on CF  which may/may not have influenced many users to start withdrawing their funds.* 10 Mar 2025 (Mon):  CF is now experiencing temporary delays for instant withdrawals.My Thoughts‚ùì Do I like what I‚Äôm seeing? ‚ùå Absolutely not. This is a PR disaster and a potential loss of trust among current and future customers.‚ùì What am I doing now? üîπ Nothing. I haven‚Äôt had funds in CF since Dec 2024  and I‚Äôve already made my stance clear.At the end of the day  when situations like this arise  it‚Äôs crucial to do your own due diligence. No one cares more about your money than you do. Stay safe and make the best decisions for yourself.,btohqsg
work for me leh. I instant withdrew $500 Sunday night. Not a big fund though..,btohqsg
In the event that they do collapse *touch wood*  is it right to assume that the market money funds that were not withdrawn could be inherited by another financial institution and customers won‚Äôt be impacted?,btohqsg

Seems like not only instant withdrawals affected ü§™,btohqsg
IMPORTANT:Instant withdrawals are temporarily unavailable. However  you can still withdraw your money during this period via the standard process of selling your investments  which typically takes 3‚Äì6 business days. Please note that this process may take longer if the withdrawal is made shortly after adding funds to your account. Additionally  once a withdrawal is confirmed  it cannot be cancelled.If immediate access isn‚Äôt required  you may prefer to wait until instant withdrawals are back up and running. We‚Äôre actively working to restore this service as quickly as possible and appreciate your understanding.,btohqsg

I think as loyal CF users  we should not panic and withdraw our funds hastily. Show your support and leave your money there so platform can run smoothly. After all this  maybe got give extra chocolate for us loyal users! üç´,btohqsg
The problem is even if you don‚Äôt panic and withdraw  others will. So it makes no difference,btohqsg
