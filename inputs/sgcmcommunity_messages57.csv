My friend regular at this workshop GAG.Brought his own spark plug and gear oil.Also kena expensive labor.He said might as well change at the shop. Same price. No savings at allüòÖ,btohqsg
Ask him move on from there,btohqsg
Got major difference after soundproofing ma? Idk eh  i read online some ppl say not much difference for the price they paid.,btohqsg
I was quoted S$1800 for ‚Äú3 layers‚Äù STP before from rep. workshop (Confirm kenna chop head quote),btohqsg
Saloon yes. Do full car.Do a MalaysiaMPV  SUV big window.Forget it üòÇ,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ u think i from wearnes ah,btohqsg
full car? Cheap already. Normally around 2.4k,btohqsg
i tell u sell subaru go buy ferrari already,btohqsg
bro i‚Äôd try to sell u a wrx man HAHAHA,btohqsg
u overestimating me but thanks bro i touched,btohqsg
Many many labor intense work to put sound proof.Have to becareful the paint work on the door.,btohqsg
3 layers .. tell me it‚Äôs STP highest range alr. Bs with me  show me a STP gold instead of STP Aero diamond,btohqsg
Many labour is one  but i don‚Äôt think the labour cost should be that much either LOL.,btohqsg
Oh expensive.My friend 4 wheel arch 600$ 2 layer.1 layer will do.Sound proof must doEngine bayDoor and floor first.Wheel arch don't do yet.,btohqsg
Thing is  i‚Äôm running lower profile and wider tyres  road noise is significantly more. Thought of soundproofing it to target the wheel rolling noise,btohqsg
people funny hor... change exhaust  change intake  the car sounds so nice liao  then do sound proof,btohqsg
why you ask me? weiii just because I do manual labour work ... ü•¥ü•¥,btohqsg
Singapore labor very expensiveTuition/ swimming lesson65-75/hr now. Per paxLimo 50/hr per paxIf they take 5 hr and 2 man1 HR $50 $500 labor cost easily,btohqsg
not obvious enough meh? i thought ytd already got people reveal liao hahahaha,btohqsg
cough cough never do up exhaust or engine mods hor,btohqsg
this one ah pek car one,btohqsg
tbh if you really really want silent car  change EV,btohqsg
Their Facebook name is already alarming to me. Haha,btohqsg
EV quietness is useless if you immediately change to big rims + low profile tyres,btohqsg
jialat i should start reading my messages hahaha,btohqsg
but ya la. I don‚Äôt think i wanna get low profile tyres again üòÇ,btohqsg
Filter what you want to hear mah,btohqsg
@awj_moodI also can I also can!! install wing for you free. just let me know you prefer on roof or left door?,btohqsg
noisy  changing tyres time super ex,btohqsg
Congrats on whatever it is though!! Hope to see you at the sgcm meet or other events,btohqsg
your bonnet I heard is CF,btohqsg
hahaha what tires u using now,btohqsg
I sold my last kidney for this,btohqsg
All EVs come with large rim and low profile tyresNew BYD e6 shld be also 17inch.üòÖUnless BlueSG BYD üòÇThe electric sound is killer already.,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminneed ur reaction to this beauty,btohqsg
Not so much haha but enough,btohqsg
woah i test drove the Getgo ones  more quieter than mine!!,btohqsg
I had a hard time deciding to choose between ps5 vs f1a6,btohqsg
i on pilot super sport now,btohqsg
ya. i find that michelins lifespan slightly longer than bridgestones idk maybe it‚Äôs me,btohqsg
C7.5 s6/rs6 is the best looking Audi there is to me,btohqsg
wah i hate how the b9.5 looks,btohqsg
but wah the ride comfort in my car is rock solid hahahaha,btohqsg
The front split under the hood not nice at all,btohqsg
if i didn't have to go industrial area so often i would too... end up choose something that will not break my bank to replace in case sidewall puncture,btohqsg
Also don't like the giant screen inside that's not integrated,btohqsg
so end up what u on now,btohqsg
For all other models integrated into the centre console,btohqsg
A4 and A5 it's just there,btohqsg
it‚Äôs either michelin or bridgestone tbh  continental and pirelli so overrated and expensive,btohqsg
A4 and A5 is the same actually. Just exterior  one is sportback  one is sedan. Comfort  go for A4. Sporty and low  A5. Do note A5 is a low slung car.. and low.. low .. low..,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like 3 and 4 series lor haha,btohqsg
but 4 series the bigger boot does it for me,btohqsg
had one for awhile  freaking loved it,btohqsg
Yuppp  but the taillights slightly different for b9.5 a5 compared to the A4,btohqsg
ngl i not a big fan of audis,btohqsg
Sadly PA doesn't let you spec but you can change out to wooden panels as well,btohqsg
but the b7 rs4 forever one of my fave audis,btohqsg
dependent on personal preference.. some ppl like mercedes  some like audi  some like bmw .. some like volvos etc.,btohqsg
but u saying this cos u had one right,btohqsg
ya they damn .. ?!$& say need indent ‚Ä¶ need wait .. must take their stock .. if not must wait for next batch shipping etc.,btohqsg
Anyone knows a 3-4 year old A5 2.0 Design roughly how much the depre should be,btohqsg
So anything more is ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù alr?,btohqsg
They range between late 19s to early 21k,btohqsg
yall cute but i like toyota more,btohqsg
19K - 22K (From my viewpoint),btohqsg
i love toyota raize  faster than M and AMG cars,btohqsg
Make sure to look at mileage and service history if buying now,btohqsg
Someone I know had transmission oil issues as soon as they bought because previous owner never service,btohqsg
Eh I got tourador on the left side of mine,btohqsg
My friend changed to using greentrac without telling me. That night he went through corners and all  i didn‚Äôt knew it was a chinese tyre!,btohqsg
Then they put both the stickers on,btohqsg
maybe F1 shld do that too,btohqsg
One side pirelli other side Michelin,btohqsg
Then is your LBWK sticker between those stickers too?,btohqsg
Great to hear some good reviews about them too. Always heard bad reviews especially in the wet,btohqsg
I think dry grip still ok with touradors but wet and heavy braking cannot make it,btohqsg
I only break kickball record in primary school,btohqsg
arnav i think ur car the doctor gearbox one issit,btohqsg
drive like one dog then when crash free gearbox overhaul ah,btohqsg
He told me in the wet is damn good also. But .. need wait for time to tell whether the longevity is good or not.245/35/19 + 275/30/19 = $560,btohqsg
Same size as me Michelin is $1480,btohqsg
I wouldn't go for them personally because of trust issues,btohqsg
But would be nice to hear,btohqsg
no eh. hahah. i‚Äôll remain stock.,btohqsg
if you have upgrades i personally think sticking to low profile is worth the ride comfort hahaha,btohqsg
I have too much mechanical sympathy to do that,btohqsg
Fwd spinning in the wet is next level,btohqsg
fwd‚Ä¶ i no extra $100 000 for quattro,btohqsg
üòÇ siao eh.. PA quattro model another 6 digits that time,btohqsg
It's sad knowing that in other markets the differential is sub 20k,btohqsg
Then their specs also damn basic most of the time,btohqsg
If you want to spec they really try to push their in stock car more,btohqsg
Actually  Audi Singapore .. their inventory .. are mostly somewhat .. base models,btohqsg
Next time base model will have subscription based AC in sg,btohqsg
You see those normal B9 A4 on the roads  the grille black colour one  no chrome. that is a base model to european countries.,btohqsg
They sell it as a style pack,btohqsg
Gloss black grille also need to pay extra,btohqsg
Ok leh black nicer than chrome.,btohqsg
Even if i buy chrome end up dechrome...,btohqsg
Audi hard to sell in SG. Ppl in SG want shouty looks .. audi design very understated. Dependent on individual preferences.,btohqsg
Problem is people rather buy BMW for the same price as audi,btohqsg
üòÄ ya some ppl told me that too haha,btohqsg
ya. some ppl also prefer the mercedes over the audi. most of the time is this. Mercedes designs for their exteriors and cabins are super beautiful!,btohqsg
but tbh.. next car.. i‚Äôll not get a luxury marque anymore.. imo  could used the money for something else.,btohqsg
No one is talking about the accord hor?,btohqsg
And pay honda tax ah... siao,btohqsg
@SGCM_Admineh you‚Äôll never review the Accord ah?!,btohqsg
"Most buy Merc because ""class"" ""10 year warranty""",btohqsg
And the c160 and a180s exist,btohqsg
Younger gen all love rgb lights.. give them RGB lighting that sync with their tiktok vids huge sales,btohqsg
The main thing Mercedes has going for them is the interior,btohqsg
So many see it as a win to be able to have an interior similar to an s or e class at the a class level,btohqsg
wahh brooo. Mercedes ambient lights quite distracting for me sia. especially the ones at the dashboard,btohqsg
I love the tech man. And simple look.,btohqsg
Hence A5 is my preferred option,btohqsg
‚úåüèª Get the car you truly love. Not to satisfy others  but for yourself only.,btohqsg
Just a bit sad that it doenst have blind spot monitor,btohqsg
Also audi is same mqb platform as VW  you're paying extra for the 4 rings,btohqsg
ppl buy Mercedes is because 8 to 80 yo know marcelli,btohqsg
In SG  tasted one time of owning a luxury marque car good enough for me le.,btohqsg
Then i really know.. i should use the money for a non-luxury brand-luxury sedan/suv,btohqsg
I agree  i experienced 1 year of bmw warranty service  actually nothing much haha,btohqsg
Like camry  accord  mazda 6/Harrier  CX-9.. etc.,btohqsg
üÖ±Ô∏èOLüÖ±Ô∏èO make very simplistic sleek interior with the perfect mix of gloss and matte for me. Most settings are controlled via the 9 inch potrait screen so it creates quite a clean finish.Also  scandinavian woohoo,btohqsg
not bad.. u got taste for scandinavian designs ‚úåüèª,btohqsg
haha yes  been many years and i still love them,btohqsg
subaru is the perfect mix of brash and cheap for me,btohqsg
He likes swedish cars like how we like our swedish meatballs,btohqsg
Actually  swedish meatballs are turkish.. just like volvo is actually... chinese...,btohqsg
It's cheap until it decides to jibaboom,btohqsg
That's where the brash comes in,btohqsg
the brash is the ride quality also,btohqsg
but no complaints cos this slow wagon handles better then some conti cars i‚Äôve had,btohqsg
Beyond sticker shock: Running costs first-time car owners must considerBuying your first car? Don't just calculate the down payment and monthly instalments. Here are the other costs you must also factor in!üëâüèª React with üò± if you agree owning a car in Singapore isEXPENSIVE!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
NEVER ‚Ä¶ EVER.. buy a new car from the showroom.,btohqsg
Buy almost new. Don‚Äôt buy new.,btohqsg
I think you have to justify why thoü§î-R,btohqsg
Depreciation .. Depreciation .. Once you roll out of the showroom  depreciation kicks in. For every owner  the FIRST owner suffers from the depreciation the most.,btohqsg
If nobody buy new where got almost new eh?,btohqsg
current car hasnt had any depreciation on the car,btohqsg
u see those teslas too  still earning,btohqsg
Ownself know can liao.. that's why most of us here use sgcm buy used cars ü§≠,btohqsg
naohiaaaa with the current coe u mean hahahha,btohqsg
some ppl legit prefer a new car from the showroom. that‚Äôs up to them.,btohqsg
imo  a smart car buyer.. will buy almost new.,btohqsg
I buy used car and put new car flavor air freshener - tadaaaa,btohqsg
and don‚Äôt buy first batch too.,btohqsg
cash and carry la. first time buyer should not used HP. No money ask mama,btohqsg
yup! From what I know  most people buy brand new car for that piece of mind-R,btohqsg
Can retrofit later if you'd like,btohqsg
u will still tank heavy depre broüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Sadly most in Singapore don't come with it,btohqsg
but u don‚Äôt lose as much as the first owner,btohqsg
might be even heavier than the first owner,btohqsg
first owner usually lose 20% alr,btohqsg
If you will own for at least 5-7 years then new car ok,btohqsg
coe high when u buy second hand  coe drop when u own u lose way way more,btohqsg
just suck thumb buy toto and no need worry abt all this,btohqsg
It is also the perfect mix of oil and water,btohqsg
But for those with itchy backside like me  have to get those cars with <5yrs coe,btohqsg
You can always buy first hand if you know which car to buy and find the correct timing,btohqsg
HAHAHHAHHA you never fail to make my day with your unexpected jokesüòÜ-R,btohqsg
Yeahh  year 3 onwards can save on the heavy depre,btohqsg
The heaviest depre stages are year 3 and year 5,btohqsg
Those buy brand newHopefully don't join this chat groupPlease continue and earn lots of money and keep changing carüòÇüëç,btohqsg
Buy and use  mod it to your taste. Once done  move to next one,btohqsg
400 worldwide only  100 of them in sunshine yellow,btohqsg
Flood the market for us to buy ü§óü§óü§ó,btohqsg
I always buy first hand and change car though  so far still in the GREEN BOYYYSSS,btohqsg
All about buying at the right time in the cycle,btohqsg
Buy when COE low  sell when COE high can have chance to stay in the green,btohqsg
Also must buy a car that can hold its value,btohqsg
Hi does your name happen to be imran and do you do youtube Ads? buy low sell high,btohqsg
So need to choose the right car,btohqsg
I would buy management unit if it wasnt very much abused by singaporeans,btohqsg
For example if you bought a Volvo S60 in 2018 just before the refresh,btohqsg
I dont want to buy a car that has been redlined for 8 hours 7 days a week for the past 5 months,btohqsg
Mine was ok. PA offered a 5 years warranty for it.,btohqsg
Unless you got a higher trim which is worth enough for the engine,btohqsg
PML most of management units is the staff use one,btohqsg
Lose abt 15 after 3 years of usage,btohqsg
even the test drive cars is the staff drive home kind,btohqsg
also i got a very good price la,btohqsg
squeezed the shit out of them,btohqsg
Must get good deal at both ends,btohqsg
Mine was used as their service shuttle limousine before lol. that‚Äôs what they say la,btohqsg
sold for 88k bought at arnd 105?,btohqsg
Must be management unit used by staff,btohqsg
cnc the AMG management units are 90% staff driven too,btohqsg
or sometimes  they could be loaners,btohqsg
but cnc majority test drive cars not a lot of cars the staff bring back,btohqsg
But need to judge the management also,btohqsg
either way  doubt the driver will gaf cos it isnt their car,btohqsg
Some staff really drive to whack only,btohqsg
Few months back bmw got promo for event cars used for air show that was pretty good deal,btohqsg
common . if i‚Äôm the sales team  i‚Äôll whack it too,btohqsg
hope u have a flat tire,btohqsg
Air show cars not too bad but the spec isn't the highest,btohqsg
but hor coastal road damn dirty,btohqsg
i wouldnt if i were u,btohqsg
Worse is those shopping malls show unit,btohqsg
He already has head gasket issues man,btohqsg
all the kids probably scratch the paint and leather,btohqsg
Stone chips easy to fix. But that is the definition of almost new,btohqsg
Can nego for respray on bumper and impact areas at times,btohqsg
sooner or later gonna get head issues too,btohqsg
If you don't see it  its not damaged-R,btohqsg
How damaged can it be? Not like the rocks will crack the exhaust,btohqsg
i mean.... thats my opinion la,btohqsg
Not gonna see the undercarriage that much anyway,btohqsg
I might sound entitled but its like if you break a stick and glue it back  it will never be the same,btohqsg
i ocd owner ah so HEHE,btohqsg
ironic cos i own a cui brand,btohqsg
Shhhh install race plate can liao. Cover everything,btohqsg
sike not cui at all hehehe i love boxer,btohqsg
True but you are paying for a broken stick,btohqsg
Mine got stone chips on the glass upon viewing haha,btohqsg
Not a brand new off the tree one,btohqsg
anyways  it‚Äôs a management unit. lower my expectations,btohqsg
LAME JOKES DESERVES TO BE WARNED,btohqsg
Used cars must compromise here and there,btohqsg
The key components should be good,btohqsg
then you should be getting lots of warnings-R,btohqsg
You know Russell  you're just acting like you don't,btohqsg
u the mr pete of lame jokes,btohqsg
they kindly offered me a 5 years warranty upon handing ownership of it so yea why not haha,btohqsg
screw that guy he clown  and if his 3rd acc is here i hope he sees this,btohqsg
For me interior condition is a key factor. Cannot buy car with bad interior condition,btohqsg
im sorry i cannot have ppl jump on my seats and scratch the plastics and leather,btohqsg
Apart from powertrain and suspension being in good condition,btohqsg
Wear and tear on these can be fixed as well,btohqsg
and the steering wheel cannot be worn until shiny,btohqsg
Seats and interior trims hard to fix,btohqsg
Cut to  your dogs doing that,btohqsg
ALSO  those show unit are on 8 hours a day without driving  whoch means its bad for the battery,btohqsg
more excuses for you to change steering wheel tho-R,btohqsg
HAHAHA i still want that skoda,btohqsg
and i dont want to get stranded in the middle of the carpark 1 week after i collect the car,btohqsg
Well they are on trickle chargers,btohqsg
but the markup COE incurs on to it makes it not worth at all,btohqsg
oh! they gave a new battery for me btw. haha,btohqsg
oh ya  you are a wagon kind of guy-R,btohqsg
Management units on higher models of the brand are good shouts too,btohqsg
Mine was also a showroom unit before it turned into their limousine.,btohqsg
They tend to be given to higher management usually and are never loaners,btohqsg
I thought the PA limos are only A6 or A8s,btohqsg
i think you shud upgrade to wagon next@Jingxunn,btohqsg
I've only ever seen the a8L,btohqsg
u wanna buy me another car?,btohqsg
wah that one only if you‚Äôre lucky. i heard ppl need ask de then can have,btohqsg
niceeee. What made you pick the A4 over the other 2 German brands?-R,btohqsg
if never ask  you‚Äôll get a taxi voucher,btohqsg
Yeah they don't pull it out for regular customers,btohqsg
Must be very lucky to get offered the a8,btohqsg
Or have a very atas car/good relationship with the dealer,btohqsg
It is still better than many other dealers though,btohqsg
They just offer to book self paid comfort cabs,btohqsg
oh ya some companies when u go servicing the loaners are good hahaha,btohqsg
Wearnes has good service in this area  they offer loaners to all,btohqsg
does that mean when my bugatti go in for servicing i get a divo for the week,btohqsg
you got bugatti meh  or bulgogi,btohqsg
yes i got the lego version,btohqsg
Interior build quality is solid  metals are being used at certain areas  not plastics. the ergonomics positioning of the buttons  the sensation of clicks  the refinement and especially attention to details. And the cabin is very similar and almost based to their expensive Q7. It‚Äôs a comfort car  not a sports sedan. One that i‚Äôll enjoy owning it for myself  as what Julian also says in his review  you don‚Äôt buy the A4 to show off  you buy to appreciate as a whole.,btohqsg
Well put togetherüëèüèª And you even quoted Julian HAHHA nice!-R,btohqsg
wah covered the rear doors ah hahahahaha,btohqsg
last time bring my S60 there they loan XC90 cos they need to take more than 1 day,btohqsg
Does he get an extra brownie point for the next giveaway üëÄüëÄ,btohqsg
Its also abit stupid cos wearnes Volvo need to pay Weanres Pre Owned to lend the car out,btohqsg
Volvos are so underrated :( they deserve more love,btohqsg
no la. Everyone who participates in a giveaway will stand an equal chance of winning the prize.-R,btohqsg
haha singaporeans dont like volvo  no 3 pointed stars,btohqsg
Still better than getting a cab booked that you have to pay for,btohqsg
When the service centre says long queue and they need 2 day for 2 hour jobs,btohqsg
LOL usually they do tht though  book a cab for you 1 way,btohqsg
that time u send the list of cars some volvo fanatic owned,btohqsg
i saw it was a long message,btohqsg
maybe you mentioned a banned word,btohqsg
Mine is $10 voucher.$3.90 flag fee + $3.30 booking fee  end up only got $2.80 left to travel ü§¨,btohqsg
last time i heard those service centre will use cabcharge,btohqsg
go from audi leng kee to mclaren leng kee only,btohqsg
but okay la. one time had a seatback lambar panel replacement  downtime 3 days  they offered a loaner car for free.‚Ä¶ wa piang woi.. loaner car .. also Audi A4. same as mine üòÖ,btohqsg
legal in sg  but must t ake out the turbo,btohqsg
Ah yes  I heard there was a problem in the lumbar panel,btohqsg
you get a sound of something shaking or moving inside,btohqsg
Really meh. I see so many xc40Especially Holland and Bukit timah area.,btohqsg
idk is it me.. but i find when a person driving a Volvo S90 has much more taokayness compared to someone driving an 5 series  E Class  A6.It looks very way more professional/business imo.,btohqsg
haha e class image been spoiled by PHV and the low specs (e180)whereas 5 series image been spoiled by YPs and ah bengs,btohqsg
i really cannot dahan the low spec e classes,btohqsg
I wouldn't judge anyone based on their choice of vehicle though  i know a few bosses of companies they rather drive innocuous sylphy or camry,btohqsg
Yes i do feel the same way especially with the S90 inscription,btohqsg
driving a good car doesn't buy you class,btohqsg
i dare say most of the techy stuff in bmw and mercs u will not use it 2-3 years down the road,btohqsg
i really don't understand how they can go from VW sciroccos to F10s,btohqsg

A 1.5 Turbo alternate to a 3.3 Twin turbo? HAHAHA nice try,btohqsg
"SGCM need to double check their definition of  ""High-performance""",btohqsg
heard u got the nicest stinger in sg ü´£,btohqsg
No way that there was a suggestion for an f10 520i and 528i as an alt to a gs350,btohqsg
The units on the market are ermm,btohqsg
As usual  poor journalist standard. Poor senseless comparisons,btohqsg
They might as well say GTR hard to find  replace is a Toyota Vios,btohqsg
Forget about 530i as there are no listings?,btohqsg
3 listings for 540is as well,btohqsg
1.2 vs 1.4 golf  which one will u pay for?,btohqsg
WT F WHERE U SPAWN THE 39 UNITS FROM,btohqsg
As soon as they posted the article. All decided to sell.,btohqsg
they sian pay 100k in premium kena compared to GS350,btohqsg
Im barely 30 and I do this,btohqsg
I'm 20 and I'm doing it alr,btohqsg
None of this car is enjoyable. Engine too small,btohqsg
For a small unit only car best to get Japanese,btohqsg
Disagree... the GTI and Golf R are 2 of the most fun hot hatches to drive,btohqsg
That‚Äôs rubbish. Did you read what cars are discussed in question? Those are small cc engined cars. They‚Äôre craps no matter what turbo you slap on it. GTi has bigger engine. 2 liter at least. Correct?,btohqsg
How can these be fun at all,btohqsg
I have to say  1.4 VW engines.Don‚Äôt  underestimate the cc number.You‚Äôll be very surprised.,btohqsg
Bruh... you go watch the end of the video anot,btohqsg
Walao anyhow smack without watching the video,btohqsg
The fact is a small engined car will never equal to the driving pleasure or feel of a larger engined car.,btohqsg
Even if a turbo makes more powerful. It‚Äôs different feeling,btohqsg
You should see more videos about this because arriving at such conclusion.,btohqsg
We‚Äôll take the Turbo. You can have the NA. I‚Äôll take the turbocharged car imo.,btohqsg
A 1.2 turbo car will never be the same as a 2 liter car.,btohqsg
And pales in comparison in driving enjoyment,btohqsg
I was skeptical for our average cars to have a downsized engine with a turbocharged slapped in it  until when I tried and owned it  wah  times have changed indeed.,btohqsg
A proper gTi is 2 liter turbo,btohqsg
Sigh... don't wanna argue with someone who doesn't even see the end of the video and make baseless statements that vastly differ base on personal preference,btohqsg
Drive it. Don‚Äôt argue over video,btohqsg
1.2 turbo is made to attack the market where affordability sells,btohqsg
sua alr. u just happy with what u have can liaoo,btohqsg
Take the car over long distance you will know the diff,btohqsg
yeah man  sometimes they can fire rods out of their engine bay further than subies,btohqsg
driving PLEASURE wise  NA over turbo for large cc cars,btohqsg
but u tell me 1.0L turbo vs 1.2L NA  i will take the turbo,btohqsg
Got to be reasonably large engined for long distance driving. Otherwise stressed out,btohqsg
This topic confirm will have debate one hahahah,btohqsg
This one is similar class comparison.,btohqsg
Forcing pleasure for a larger engined turbo is good. Say 2 liter onward.,btohqsg
i mean dont compare EA888 to S65 or M156,btohqsg
Speak about Clio RS. I wld rather take the Mk3 RS which have a 2.0L NA compared to the Mk4 RS 1.6L turbo,btohqsg
Take the examples of proton x50 and another car say 2 liter offering more or less similar power  the x50 feels stressful to drive,btohqsg
1.2 turbo 1.4 turbo is just too stressful to drive,btohqsg
turbo car tend to overheat alot.. scary,btohqsg
okay la not saying the 1.2L is sh!t but personal preference wld be the larger cc,btohqsg
@arnavgulianiJust had a chat with the friend who‚Äôs using the Greentrac tyres  17 000km clocked  it‚Äôs going strong. With acceptable wear levels. It‚Äôs more than enough for the average-joe enthusiast driver.,btohqsg

bonus points if you drive a subuwu,btohqsg
This one I have to agree with u.. Personally i have driven own both 1.4 and 2.0 before. But in sg many will prefer to take the smaller cc.. But for me I still prefer to choose to drive a 2.0 and above..,btohqsg
good steps for you to take@shaneeeeeeeeeeeee,btohqsg

What should I look for when buying a car from dealers,btohqsg
In my case a Honda Fit with 21 months left  exterior of the car looks ok. But the dealer doesn‚Äôt want to provide any guarantee or any sorts for the car at all even for a month,btohqsg
If u want to get big cc I don‚Äôt see the point of still looking at how much is your fuel efficiency.. Is not about spending more money. Nothing as best of both world. U want a horse to run but don‚Äôt want feed it.,btohqsg
Get an inspection done on the car  if the dealer is not keen  walk away,btohqsg
No dealer will provide you a guarantee other than the mandatory 6 months on engine and gearbox which is for very severe cases only,btohqsg
Wear and tear and everything else is on you,btohqsg
For lemon law it‚Äôs compulsory right,btohqsg
Will it in black and white,btohqsg
Yes but claims process is hard,btohqsg

I always trust car sold by direct owner,btohqsg
You might come across a direct owner who knows the extent of their liability well,btohqsg
Yeah I bot 6 within a year,btohqsg
There's always an argument that direct seller means lemon law doesn't cover...but then again the warranty provided also covers nothing much,btohqsg
Or might come across a great dealer who offers you a transparent deal  wear and tear warranty  allow inspection  etc.,btohqsg
How to know if the direct seller is really the direct seller at first contact?,btohqsg
Then I find workshop to fix till I like,btohqsg
I want to buy a new sport,btohqsg
honestly buy direct may not be the best also,btohqsg
I was there. üòÇ(Still here actually),btohqsg

I my short 1 year of driving..I learn to do research before commit anything,btohqsg
Nowadays it's so easy  all the power of social media,btohqsg
Erm  why need to change intercooler? Old one dirty?,btohqsg
or u modding for more power,btohqsg
if u modding need for power,btohqsg

Extra cooling is also slightly more hp right,btohqsg
