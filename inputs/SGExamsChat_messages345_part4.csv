but hopefully i dont jinx myself with this for monday’s paper,btohqsg
hows ur social studies going HAHA,btohqsg
Does anyone know of free/cheap study places in singapore thats between serangoon and paya lebar? Or somewhere near these 2 stations is fine too,btohqsg
Paya lebar square outside free study spot,btohqsg
Hi is anyone here able to explain to me what dae to poly is about ?,btohqsg
Using your O Level grades to enter the courses ur eligible for if EAE isn’t successful.,btohqsg
oh ok so try early  if cannot then try direct?,btohqsg
EAE is to secure the course you want with a lower grade requirement so yes do try for it.,btohqsg
Is the cutoff points for dae lower?,btohqsg
For social studies why is it important to keep up with current affairs,btohqsg
cause I thought it’s more about skills?,btohqsg
Sometimes the author of a specified excerpt may be a public figure like ur ministers & opposing party members  so it helps to contextualise the excerpts better,btohqsg
id rather not get smacked by fuzzy LMAO,btohqsg
Good smack… worth smacking from a pro lol,btohqsg
true true maybe if he smack me i can get A for chem lol,btohqsg
Is there ecf in a levels,btohqsg
Is a mystery that Cambridge dun disclose when there is and where there isn't,btohqsg
For schools usually math there is no ecf,btohqsg
O level but so far I only ever see ECF used in chem calc,btohqsg
Idk abt Phys tho I don't take,btohqsg
i got feeling they dun even read working (especially if ans is correct),btohqsg
ecf is given when it's not within the same part of a question but made use of answers in an earlier part  ie part ii,btohqsg
actually after marking many papers  immediately know where to spot in the workings to find out where there's a careless or a bluff,btohqsg
After marking the same question many times I mean,btohqsg
Not true. Cambridge has months to mark. In their exam reports they do point out mistakes that sch teachers may not have paid much attention on,btohqsg
"they do random sampling for that right? like a couple of scripts they pull out to ""mark properly"" and set the standards",btohqsg
my point was that if ur marker didnt bother with looking through working  pretty much nobody would know,btohqsg
do u feel so? how much is an examiner paid for 1 script? based on that  how much time do u think they take?,btohqsg
Like what Jun Wei mentioned. It is easy to memorise the whole list of standard errors. It is e@sy to spot the mistakes thereafter.,btohqsg
One subject per pax MOE paid can be hundreds,btohqsg
yes  and that's for how many scripts?,btohqsg
yea so if u mess up 1 working u ggwp,btohqsg
Anyway the point is nobody really knows how the scripts are marked. ECF or not... So better not give the wrong info that makes other members here think marking is less lax than what it seems,btohqsg
really ah? so if u grade 20 scripts u get ~10 000?,btohqsg
Minus off all the other administration fees. Etc.Even $10 or $20 per script (and need not even be full script if is marked by question) is pretty good money.Anyways is not about money or what. But is a pretty bold statement to say they do random making or anyhow mark.Things that my contacts in SEAB also do not know i am surprised you seem to know more.,btohqsg
sg budget for SEAB per year ~200mln,btohqsg
lets say O levels take 6 subj  A levels take 4 subj (conservative),btohqsg
so that is 400 000 papers to mark every year,btohqsg
if what u say is correct  then SEAB use their whole budget just to pay for marking?,btohqsg
So the message I want to mention is dear students dun rely on ECF etc or lax marking and be less careful of your work or put less effort,btohqsg
last time we used to need to pay near $100 per subject to take O and A levels,btohqsg
idk i rmbr there was some news article abt it,btohqsg
Hey guys I have a qn to ask! Should I be taking a break after prelims or should I continue revising for o levels ? I feel kind of burnt out tbh. Thanks !,btohqsg
break for a day or 2,btohqsg
If u feel burnt out remedy it asap,btohqsg
Else it'll snowball and become more of a shitstorm,btohqsg
I feel I cannot let go of studying the content,btohqsg
Rest for awhile  but not too long if not ltr become lazi  ☠☠,btohqsg
Has anyone triedbrilliant.org? Specifically to cover H2 maths? Does anyone think brilliant is rigerous enough,btohqsg
How long is not too long Hahaha,btohqsg
