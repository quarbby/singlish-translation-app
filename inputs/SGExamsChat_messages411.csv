Reminds me of those fun learning books,btohqsg
I know that now but at the time I was like,btohqsg
I am finally releasing the A level version next year  2nd edition. Took too long :(,btohqsg
Imma go allout of chem p1,btohqsg
I‚Äôd be interested to get a copy ngl. I‚Äôve been meaning to catch back up to the syllabus,btohqsg
Sometimes I look at A level questions,btohqsg
And I know the knowledge is somewhere in my brain,btohqsg
Except nobody sexts ten minute long messages,btohqsg
but this year happy  hit many of the A level explain questions. Is whether students remember,btohqsg
too bad I don't study physics,btohqsg
I look at A level questions. After 14 years  I still learning that there are things I didn't know,btohqsg
Yea but there‚Äôs just certain topics that I haven‚Äôt had any reason to touch in years,btohqsg
Like the scariest classes in uni for me to TA are the first year ones lol,btohqsg
Moral of the story I shared with my students  you will never finish learning  there will always be more things you don't know.So just prep enough and don't over stress for the exams,btohqsg
I shouldn‚Äôt even put in so much wasted time to tell him stuff that he wouldn‚Äôt bother reading anyways.,btohqsg
What I‚Äôve told people is that my Uni first year midterm came out an exact question from my JC prelims,btohqsg
Hmm ok  I will talk to the admin when it is done to see if I am able to offer it at a discount.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt mind just buying full price since it‚Äôs just a reference,btohqsg
I‚Äôve paid hundreds of dollars for some textbooks,btohqsg
my prof brought in a 160 dollar nice textbook on topological band theory,btohqsg
I had this thing I wasn't sure when I was O level  on why pd can be measured across primary coil in an ideal transformer,btohqsg
And immediately uses it as a ruler on the whiteboard,btohqsg
A coil was just wires with no resistance for ideal transformer,btohqsg
never re-visit this own question until this year  where suddenly in the middle of the night I woke up and understood,btohqsg
Faraday and Lenz must have visited me in my dreams and taught me,btohqsg
I have intensive googling skills when I don‚Äôt get smth,btohqsg
a lot of A level physics questions still carry many assumptions and at times I think about how it‚Äôd be like removing said assumptions,btohqsg
me too. But hard to trust all the answers. Plus the phrasing can be quite off.,btohqsg
Last time whenever I google a concept  first site is hyperphysics,btohqsg
Now the algorithm learned and just pumps out research papers,btohqsg
hyperphysics has some parts that were a bit off  but I can't remember,btohqsg
Do they remove said assumptions when you get to the PhD studies level,btohqsg
and it was last year that I suddenly understood polarisation even more,btohqsg
I mean the fundamental idea of Physics is first working with a model we know how to deal with and slowly extending to the more messy situations  so yes for my classes but in research it depends,btohqsg
Like in my second year classical mechanics  the first thing we immediately did was solve a differential equation for free fall,btohqsg
since we have air resistance drag now,btohqsg
And then the rocket equation  which is conservation of momentum with a changing mass and velocity,btohqsg
But a lot of these harder situations require more math as well  sometimes way beyond H2 level  and A level physics doesn‚Äôt quite make use of the different branches,btohqsg
@GwynLimy u so tilted by some online stranger,btohqsg
This is why physics is always going to be more superior than biology.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm low key looking forward to TAing,btohqsg
i look forward to crashing ur class,btohqsg
Well  good enough  i ship it,btohqsg
only i can cuz he saw what a mess sim is,btohqsg
Depends which time in the class,btohqsg
It might have also been boring cos I alr know the stuff they teaching,btohqsg
A lecture I‚Äôm attending or a lecture I‚Äôm giving,btohqsg
Is anything ever really boring when I‚Äôm around,btohqsg
Exactly. You‚Äôre welcome for my presence.,btohqsg
I might give talks at conferences next year idk,btohqsg
There‚Äôs one in Jan where the guy who gave himself a stomach ulcer to prove it‚Äôs caused by bacteria is speaking,btohqsg
TLDR people thought stomach ulcers were caused by spice and stress,btohqsg
he tried to prove them wrong but his findings got rejected,btohqsg
so he tested it on himself,btohqsg
I can only jio if it‚Äôs Singapore,btohqsg
usually conferences need pay but from what I‚Äôve seen,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs hosted in a Uni they don‚Äôt check before you enter the lecture,btohqsg
Stomach ulcer guy is Nobel Laureate now btw,btohqsg
I was js innocently looking for food   came back here to see this,btohqsg
oh but the girls are hot,btohqsg
as a plane enthusiast I wanna know,btohqsg

Help yourself get over the delusional opinion that you have of yourself.,btohqsg
Ask those who went to poly,btohqsg
Ever so the drama queen still  I see? Guess some things just don‚Äôt ever change.,btohqsg
The worst part is not the fact that you might‚Äôve fractured your wrist that might not heal correctly?,btohqsg
Not something to be flexing about.,btohqsg
Do you really want to leave it to chance  though?,btohqsg
Me every 10 seconds in my house:,btohqsg
Mind nagging at Woo to take his possible fracture seriously,btohqsg
People may have high pain tolerance or congenital insensitivity to pain,btohqsg
What if you popped it back in the incorrect way,btohqsg
I‚Äôm giving you the nickname of wimp from now on.,btohqsg
YOU COULD GIVE YOURSELF A LIGAMENT TEAR.,btohqsg
Those fortunate enough to have full mobility range control over their bodies better take better care of yourself and your body  because it hasn‚Äôt failed you yet  and you sure as heck don‚Äôt want to experience limited mobility  because you refused to take your health seriously  and actually ignored it being exacerbated until it worsens to be irreparable damage to your body.,btohqsg
sounds like my time to shine@Voidchords,btohqsg
i dont want to move my limbs no more,btohqsg
Its a surface fracture on your bone  like a slight crack in the metaphorical road pavement that is your bones.,btohqsg
I'm gonna have toxic relationships w my group mates,btohqsg

if i eae  does that mean yes? unfortunately,btohqsg
I tell u last warning kuro,btohqsg
I'm going to whack u to dear heaven,btohqsg
No. Because I have experienced what it feels like to have your body mobility hold you back from living. And I think that you should treasure your body more.,btohqsg
Is there any cases where you tell the school you really want to drop out of eae and change courses,btohqsg
hallo where's my reply to my pms,btohqsg
I mean like after O levels results,btohqsg

not recess week but recess year,btohqsg
ok kuro old people things can't relate orite,btohqsg
My teacher like kept pressurizing students to eae wtf,btohqsg
No  but the way you‚Äôre acting is proving my point. I get that you‚Äôre young and all we only have one life to live  we only live once  but dude  no. That isn‚Äôt a blank cheque to go around doing inane acts to risk you being unable to do as many experiences as you could get in your life time because you missed out.,btohqsg

Istg at this rate I love gwyn,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not dignifying this question with a decently serious response  because I haven‚Äôt even interacted with you so excuse me if I don‚Äôt exactly feel comfortable or trust you enough to share an extensive answer of what I can and cannot do or what my physical mobility limitations are to your insensitively phrased question directed to a stranger that you‚Äôve never even spoken two sentences to before.,btohqsg
I'm spamming while she's typing dogshit knows what bro,btohqsg
Oh wait. Isit sth that makes u uncomfortable,btohqsg
Just don‚Äôt fall asleep when lives are on the line.,btohqsg
