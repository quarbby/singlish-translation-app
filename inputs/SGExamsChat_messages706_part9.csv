do i still look back and said i did shit in psle and hate myself for it,btohqsg
idk why he called asrjc mid-low jc,btohqsg
personally i dont feel comfortable with the jc tiers,btohqsg
Ya it's not even that low,btohqsg
probably coz of the merger and serangoon dragged it down,btohqsg
it used to be sub 10 cut off a few years back,btohqsg
end of the day itâ€™s the students that go in not the sch itself,btohqsg
NAH the last comment is so ðŸ’€ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
@polarbearnextdooryou have to see the last comment,btohqsg
what i would not even waste my time talking to someone like him,btohqsg
this guy like got borderline personality disorder lol,btohqsg
he is making an over-generalized statement  not all elites are like that,btohqsg
good boy has got me ðŸ˜­ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
tbh i keep saying i hate the elites too coz some of them are really looking down on those who arent doing that well BUT doesnt look like IP is gonna stay there so is he blaming the government,btohqsg
i remembered in sec sch i said i hated the government for creating ip coz it gives them an adv of not needing to take an extra national exam,btohqsg
i mean like it comes at a cost what if the person cannot do well for A level then gg alr,btohqsg
At least the o level person still has better qualifications,btohqsg
i donâ€™t think you can justify how heâ€™s processing things with your own thought process,btohqsg
i went on linkedin stalking spree and i realised a lot of my course mates have 90rps  im feeling inferior now,btohqsg
ok true he is not thinking like a normal person,btohqsg
why nyjc festival then become this,btohqsg
then thats a personal skill issue already,btohqsg
i think key_battle_5633 said he wanted to go ny but after seeing how hype it is he doesnt wanna go anymore ? smth like that,btohqsg
one of my bro friend got pushed back to O levels in sec 3 i think,btohqsg
but the school will not let someone go all the way to y4 if they are not performing well,btohqsg
yea if ur really ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ they wont let you promote to jc,btohqsg
if you promoted means you still got chance,btohqsg
i feel sorry for him cause he clearly has some self esteem issues that he needs to work on as a result of constantly comparing himself to other pplthen again i feel like i'd not want to be friends with people who act like this because it's kinda exhausting having to constantly validate them (and if you dont theres a high chance they'll feel like you are looking down on them),btohqsg
ok tbh no hate but vj  ri  hci are the more elite elite one  so he is not wrong in that aspect,btohqsg
wouldnâ€™t really put vj next to those,btohqsg
like i only interacted with him once but even then i was quite uncomfortable with how he kept calling himself stupid,btohqsg
actually tbh i have some sort of self-esteem issues too but just that i dun openly go say and discuss about it,btohqsg
same   i usually only talk to my close friends about it,btohqsg
actually in jc  my cher had higher confidence than me then me with myself,btohqsg
also im kinda relieved this guy isnt in the discord cause if he said he got 248 and did badly for psle  he'd be bullied which would make him feel worse because his self image is already bad,btohqsg
the cher know the A lvl syllabus more than you so they shld know your potential,btohqsg
yep he got 248 (he says it alot),btohqsg
bruh i got 213 and i just like totally moved on,btohqsg
my econs cher can say she expect an A for me despite i think my prelim was botherline B,btohqsg
i think for a lot of people who got 240-249  is either1. they are really happy cause they expected 230 range2. they are really really sad cause they cannot make it to ip and these are prob the ppl who dream of going to ip for a long time,btohqsg
my mum is more disappointed in my bro's 248 than him,btohqsg
i know both of these kinds of ppl,btohqsg
coz she knows he has potential to get 2 better,btohqsg
my mom was disappointed the day i got my results and say i should have worked harder but ended up bragging about my results to every aunty she meets,btohqsg
i dont have it cause i was scrolling through his profile,btohqsg
my dad was happy and bragging my JC results but my mum is kinda no emotions,btohqsg
my cousin told her mum that everyone asking her why her cousin is everywhere on top but where is she,btohqsg
not wrong  schools are very stingy when it comes to giving marks,btohqsg
my parents did not expect me to make it to jc,btohqsg
and then scared i will fail A levels with my O levels result,btohqsg
