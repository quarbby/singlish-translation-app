Also if I‚Äôm not wrong  before she retired‚Ä¶she was among the first batch of female navy pilots,btohqsg
Y‚Äôall heard of the missing/lost navy ship from sg?,btohqsg
At this point I already lost track of how many landing ships we have,btohqsg
I wonder how diff it must be to be assigned to a landing ship,btohqsg
Oh I know where all the landing ships went,btohqsg
They were repurposed as floating sea barricades for Changi naval base,btohqsg
However the new class of landing ships are coded ‚ÄúL07‚Äù and onwards‚Ä¶this means  there was a L06. Given to RSS Perseverance but‚Ä¶this is the ship that was lost/missing,btohqsg
