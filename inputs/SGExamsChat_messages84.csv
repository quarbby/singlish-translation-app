Smh go revise smt else apart from ss lah,btohqsg
I didn't know u liked animal crossing,btohqsg
is it worrying that I'm not able to do primary school math,btohqsg
Theres a reason why i asked,btohqsg
I dun question smt wheni know the ans,btohqsg
No unless u cant do sec sch and jc math oso,btohqsg
Take noteusernamedon't go asking ppl for answer to math question at 12am when u alr had it at 9pm the previous day,btohqsg
Wait unless its something like ‚Äúwhy is my korkor so dumb‚Äù   ‚Äúwhy am i so retarded‚Äù,btohqsg
Me too go check out kenja no mago next. The feeling is that there‚Äôs isn‚Äôt enough episodes,btohqsg

"Do you think the student in the video enjoys taking part in such a cooking lesson? Why  or why not?Describe an important life skill that is useful to a young person like you.""Schools in your country do not place enough emphasis on the teaching of useful life skills."" Do you agree?",btohqsg
And how are his legs higher than the table,btohqsg
And i just roast i dun flame,btohqsg
"Inb4 the degens come in and be like ""slap what üò≥üò≥""",btohqsg
If you say that youre the degen,btohqsg
You will eventually soften your heart,btohqsg
Syn is illiterate in english forgive her smol brain,btohqsg
Instead of white matter i have waste matter,btohqsg
Anime‚Äôs good once in a while,btohqsg
The oni useful thing is psle math,btohqsg
If ure looking for educational animes,btohqsg
Nothing else is useful to me,btohqsg
End ur life its not useful,btohqsg
ive been trying to educate myself too much. I need some time from that,btohqsg
Its not toxic if its helpful,btohqsg
If u actually do it u ain't getting any inheritance so think again,btohqsg
But one day before my first paper,btohqsg
When a bunch of people attack a particular person,btohqsg
I would like to believe they did it for the gags oni,btohqsg
Gags and laugh gags r different,btohqsg
Gtfo this IRC this is non degen place,btohqsg
Ofc i would be talking abt laugh gags,btohqsg
My hair erector muscles are contracting,btohqsg
Are u a Sec sch student,btohqsg
@cringnormidotcomdad save me i dun understand that,btohqsg
It would be cool to know if someone besides me remembers that shit after Sec sch,btohqsg
Ok fr ya im sec 4,btohqsg
Only ppl above sec 4 are allowed to be here,btohqsg
The less said about that the better,btohqsg
He can do advanced biology its exception,btohqsg
Is water a compound or molecule,btohqsg
List all observations for test for cations,btohqsg
Water is a molecule and a compound,btohqsg
R u currently planning to go to JC,btohqsg
I can do advanced chinese does that count,btohqsg
Sorry I‚Äôm taking As so remembering cation tests doesn‚Äôt exist in my life,btohqsg
No. This is non chinese server,btohqsg
I wouldnt want to pull nyjc‚Äôs average rp down,btohqsg
that‚Äôs the spirit. If u not ready to fight mad nuggets for 2 years go poly better,btohqsg
Assuming u make the cut off,btohqsg
But there‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs Anglo-Chinese instead of Anglo+Chinese,btohqsg
I tot i would get raw 7,btohqsg
I could go to any poly course but I chose jc cause I wanted to challenge smartasses,btohqsg
turns out I‚Äôm sucking at it,btohqsg
LMAO which jc u go tho,btohqsg
But what is the te hardest poly course to get in,btohqsg
Like accounting can get 11 -2,btohqsg
I alr locked my eyes on chinese studies,btohqsg
Nice a contributing member of the society,btohqsg
I would never go for chinese,btohqsg
There are actually ppl who wan go chs,btohqsg
Like the cop decreased to 10,btohqsg
Synette is bell curve wrecker for chinese but completely illiterate in english,btohqsg
Indeed  if not why kor nv get a1 huh?,btohqsg

So et in synette stands for emily tan,btohqsg
He's now contemplating the best way to murder someone and get away with it,btohqsg
S in synette stands for stupid,btohqsg
Synette sounds like a name elon musk would name its offspring,btohqsg
The b in bedok stands for b*****d,btohqsg
Omg dun make me break my streak of not saying stf up since 3/5,btohqsg
Dude wtf just go discord alr,btohqsg
No. I like u alot. Imma stay here :)))),btohqsg
Ok kor if u wan liddat,btohqsg
Ill bring et to wake u up after 20 years,btohqsg
U should go back to discord also,btohqsg
Are u telling a tele mod to go back discord,btohqsg
Pls choke on a dumbling and die also,btohqsg
Petition to double tick synette until he goes back to discord,btohqsg
Ah shit u just awakened the flexers,btohqsg
Why u nv take 9 subjects again,btohqsg
This group feels like there‚Äôs only 4 ppl,btohqsg
Fmath+math+physics add up the stuff to remember also less than bio,btohqsg
If he said that its free a,btohqsg
i mean I can also say free A,btohqsg
Judging from his response in the hw group,btohqsg
wew why chat sudd so active,btohqsg
But legit bio easier than phy,btohqsg
Don't be fooled by the activity here  it is synette and bedok pdaing here,btohqsg
If u can memorise well maybe,btohqsg
wow   last long bedok n synette,btohqsg
If u r trying to memorise for bio u r doomed to fail,btohqsg
I Guess I‚Äôll take a fail then,btohqsg
I hope i dun roast korkor too badly,btohqsg
U need to memorise the content to apply what,btohqsg
If not he gna disown me,btohqsg
U have to memorise the same way u need to memorise definitions and formulas for phy,btohqsg
Just create your own formula during the exam,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I resort to memorizing essays,btohqsg
I feel like im forgetting something,btohqsg
Why do u hate me smh,btohqsg
I totally did not see that,btohqsg
But the truth is idk what I want to do,btohqsg
But u have way less phy than i have,btohqsg
So what's ur L1R5 and R4,btohqsg
Nah I can‚Äôt fare well in bio,btohqsg
r5 was 14 r4 was 9,btohqsg
That‚Äôs more biology compare to CBE,btohqsg
U r asking a person who is suiciding by taking physics,btohqsg
Hey everyone! The livestream will be at 4pmhere:) See you there!,btohqsg
Why is there jc and Sec sch students in the live,btohqsg
I just opened chat and it disappeard,btohqsg
One day. One day ill get me revenge,btohqsg

How is F = density * area* gravity*height,btohqsg
The height refers to what here,btohqsg
It's your question haha  I can't answer it out of context,btohqsg
Combine all u get ur equation,btohqsg
This is for fluids of course,btohqsg
No im asking for the h in the m = density*h*A,btohqsg
Height of the column of fluid lor,btohqsg
The fluid one is the height from the surface to object,btohqsg
If that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre referring to,btohqsg
Non fluid that formula dont hold,btohqsg
I talking about m = den*A*h,btohqsg
You imagine having a block of wood with base area A and a height h,btohqsg
What is mass? Volume x density right  then the force exerted by some mass is VœÅg,btohqsg
But when you talk about the force exerted by a fluid at some depth h on some area A  only the fluid directly above that area exerts a force on it  so VœÅg = hAœÅg,btohqsg
Cuz the fluid in question is just a column,btohqsg
The density refers to density of fluid right,btohqsg
@UnderscoreNeilDotSu seem ready for ur course,btohqsg
am i supposed to know density of water,btohqsg
So what is the density HAHAH,btohqsg
Hahaha no i on 4th topic only aftee 2 weeks,btohqsg
You rmb 1 g cm^-3 also can,btohqsg
For this one wouldnt the faucet pressure be 0 coz height itself is 0,btohqsg
For that need the faucet pressure wad,btohqsg
The change in height is just 30?,btohqsg
The pressure in tank is straightforward,btohqsg
Faucet 0 so total change 30?,btohqsg
Idw post in alevels group coz this aint alevels,btohqsg
I think u post coding qn here more ppl can help,btohqsg
I can read documentation for it,btohqsg
Pressure due to water at the top is 0,btohqsg
Pressure due to water at the faucet is hœÅg where h is 30m,btohqsg
There‚Äôs no water above the water level in the tank right,btohqsg
Yeah so the height of water above that water level is 0,btohqsg
So the pressure acting at the top of the tank is 0,btohqsg
At the faucet  the water level above it is 30m  so the pressure there is 30œÅg,btohqsg
So this one isP = Patmosphere + Pfaucet ?,btohqsg
Of the water in the tank?,btohqsg
How come no need consider piping,btohqsg
Cuz pressure is the same along the same level,btohqsg
I vaguely remember dalton law from h2 chem,btohqsg
I have no idea how i passed that topic,btohqsg
That topic got huge overlap with h2 phy,btohqsg
Not sure if this is the right place to ask but,btohqsg
Which is better  NTU or NUS Aerospace eng?,btohqsg
Nus aerospace eng is more of a specialisation,btohqsg
Ye I know ntu one is more specific,btohqsg
But aerospace industry is quite shit in Sg,btohqsg
They dont have much advantage over mechanical engine tbh,btohqsg
Although it is alot harder to enter the course,btohqsg
The pressure along the dotted line is the same,btohqsg
I‚Äôm having a lot of trouble deciding ;-;,btohqsg
The pressure is only dependent on the height of fluid above that point  doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs directly above or not  the fluid just has to be connected,btohqsg
Lol was thinking straits times to,btohqsg
idk if my sch encourages to share tho,btohqsg
even my sec sch history notes got the copyright thing lmaoo,btohqsg
Yup sometimes within a school even lecturers dun encourage us to share or exchange notes with neighbouring classes,btohqsg
my current chem notes dont have copyright i think,btohqsg
School notes copyrighted so better not,btohqsg
My physics lecturer said he took time to prepare the notes,btohqsg
back in J1 i was enthu and took my own notes,btohqsg
After awhile it is too much manual labour,btohqsg
i realised sch notes i read thru can rmber alr,btohqsg
Sad truth about most who make notes is that most copy the notes/textbook content,btohqsg
I tend to make it more condensed,btohqsg
ofc they take references from other books,btohqsg
sec sch onli history got lecture i tot,btohqsg
SS is jus memorise format only,btohqsg
SRQ depends on ur general knowledge and language skill,btohqsg
i rmber b4 Os we got a paper wif question types and answering techniques,btohqsg
Based on marks allocated and keywords,btohqsg
in the end got A so prolly worked,btohqsg
Yup true  i think it is the process of synthesizing n reorganizing of info that reinforce their understanding of concept,btohqsg
Hi friends  I have created this new GP Telegram Channel üòÅ It's to share tips for GP and also address some FAQ. This is the link:https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEhni39Ja1zq9yjSZQThe idea is that it can become a daily dose of GP and hopefully act as your GP companion in your learning journey for A Levels! There are a lot of resources out there that focus on news and content but not enuf on Skills. It's difficult to learn skills by yourself  so hopefully this app could help you out with that.In this period of circuit breaker  I have friends and juniors who tell me that they struggle with HBL. As such  I designed this app to make it convenient to receive tips and ask questions about GP.I have personally received a lot of free help back when I was a student (not too long ago üôÉ) and I'm really really thankful for that. Now that I'm in a position to share  I just wanna give back to the community and share some of my knowledge too.All these is completely free so please tell anyone you know who's studying GP to also join. If you're doing O Levels  some of the tips and resources may also be helpful for you üôÇPlease subscribe to the channel  and get others to join too. The more we have  the richer our pool of knowledge will be  and it will hopefully be beneficial for all üòÅ It will officially start next week but meanwhile check out some of the stuff that's already there!,btohqsg
sounds like it's for a good cause but I don't know if advertising is allowed here,btohqsg
the world is your GP textbook,btohqsg
This is very very true üòÅ,btohqsg
tho most of the news readily available nowadays has to do with covid,btohqsg
"this message gives off big ""school of hard knocks is my university on facebook"" boomer vibes",btohqsg
Interestingly  COVID itself links to many themes in GP so it's definitely an issue to focus on. It links to health  politics and governance  the promise of tech  the news that goes online  the art done to encourage people in this trying time  the impact on the environment etc,btohqsg
I prefer the variants like North Korea executes covid-19 patient,btohqsg
Point of modern technology is to not live through hard times though,btohqsg
no it just links to 'I haven't heard anyone ask for an apology',btohqsg
i havent seen any of the migrant workers complain to me in person before,btohqsg
Must mean I owe them nothing,btohqsg

It's both hilarious and incredibly concerning that a MP is capable of such reasoning,btohqsg
reset your world! i heard there are several ways to do it,btohqsg
According to some Japanese documentaries  it is possible to do so by getting hit by a car,btohqsg
Theres an american source that says the car must be driven by the wife of the man whom you are cheating with on,btohqsg
If hit =true & object = ‚Äúcar‚Äù & fatality = true {Reset.player = trueVar monis = 0Var brain = 100Return monis brain player},btohqsg
Half of everything you say to me is a Gatsby reference,btohqsg
Well one of these documentaries got uploaded to neetflix recently,btohqsg
God must be a real boring person if he exists... why our lives don't have truck-kun,btohqsg
Reminds me of that controverial documentory,btohqsg
I would watch it on TV if no one else was at home,btohqsg
Konosuba's comedy doesn't get me for some reason,btohqsg
U can come over at my home,btohqsg
what do you mean  old sport?,btohqsg
maybe Re Zero is just the superior documentary,btohqsg
Gwenyth Paltrow? She's all kinds of fucked up,btohqsg
Ok weebs  I‚Äôm going to go watch manly American show,btohqsg

Mfw I can‚Äôt tell if you made that up,btohqsg
I'm extremely sorry John  it actually exists...,btohqsg
tldr he dies  god says 'oopsie  lemme bring you to a new world and give u a headstart',btohqsg
High school dxd is also on neatfix,btohqsg
DxD is one of the oldtimers,btohqsg
the picture is as low quality as the anime itself,btohqsg
Damn john watches ecchi pseudo hentai,btohqsg
DxD is one of the oldtimers,btohqsg
Ok  I‚Äôm going to go watch a man in white underwear cook meth,btohqsg
I watched when I was like 13,btohqsg
Can i spoil it 4 u,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs a pretty great show,btohqsg
I know most of the major plot points already,btohqsg
