Hi  may I know with regards to the queue number  is it out of the the available flat number of your selected flats type  e.g 4-room flat?Or the entire project e.g 2000 inclusive of 2/3/4/5 rooms flat?,btohqsg
Out of your selected flat types only,btohqsg
Any idea at which point we need apply for housing grants?,btohqsg
eh so now the new interface on HDB site can't see which are the unbooked units?,btohqsg
huh how to pick like that,btohqsg
it's like back to the old days,btohqsg
still can see those unbooked units?,btohqsg
hello  for the legal fees and stamp duty for BTO when do we pay it?,btohqsg
When you sign the agreement for lease. You pay these alongside your down-payment.,btohqsg
for BTO and SBF aka 2nd appointment  for downpayment  it's 3rd for SBF,btohqsg
Can but maybe for May not up yet,btohqsg
Open booking wonâ€™t affect our May BTO q no. Right,btohqsg
Hi thereâ€¦ any group for Kallang breeze?,btohqsg
Hello  anyone balloted for MGPS before? How are the pre selected units like?,btohqsg
What project is this? How come there are floors which are higher than the others but in the same block?,btohqsg
The recent woodlands project. Woodgrove. The solo tall HDB is Telok Blangah,btohqsg
Thank u so much for this! Much needed .,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know when the SBF will release again eh?,btohqsg
This gives you an idea on how the PPVC HDB units are being built. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Hi  any tele link for the Woodlands Ascent BTO?,btohqsg
pay $1mil for Duxton or Pinnacle or those town areas one ..still can understand.pay $1mil for boon keng... cannot comprehend.$800k for punggol? even worse,btohqsg
that's why BTO demand so high  resale market is too expensive now. Woodlands being one of the cheapest estates also close to 600k for 5rm  how to afford? what I see first thing in the morning...https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/49-year-old-hdb-terrace-house-in-whampoa-sold-for-record-1268-million,btohqsg
Actually... BTO prices also very high now. Like how profitable is Telok Blangah Beacon 4rm in the future? It's 710k now. Unless this 4R fetches 1M in the future after MOP  otherwise it will be damn lugi for more than ten years wait. (6years completion and 5 years to MOP).,btohqsg
These were only 800-900K when I was checking them out few years back .......,btohqsg
Can find original condition one for 650k even,btohqsg
But to stay 'landed' with towering HDB blocks right behind = no feel. No point.,btohqsg
Conservancy at $55/mth - that is a WOW,btohqsg
Imagine 2 fresh graduate  no savings no CPF  how to buy... that's why all fight for BTO now lorh  no matter who you are  the grants should cover the 5%  and give you another 5 years to earn the next 5%.,btohqsg
Erh.... but why would 2 fresh grad wanna buy BTO?,btohqsg
That's what most fresh grads do,btohqsg
Probably work on career first for at least 5 yrs?,btohqsg
Actually  alot of fresh grad couples buy bto,btohqsg
I see  sorry I boomer hahaha,btohqsg
No  most apply while they are in school to enjoy grants.,btohqsg
I did note there is new government policy for fresh grad to apply first,btohqsg
last time 25 year old all married have house have kids  now 25 year old no savings no job no house no kids ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Good also  to encourage couples to tie the knot early  have children early.,btohqsg
Considering the long waiting time as well...,btohqsg
My era average marriage age 30-32 for males wo,btohqsg
But the main problem now is the pricing... 700k for a bto.,btohqsg
But I guess that is water under the bridge... Since it's already oversubscribed and totally balloted out.,btohqsg
Non mature areas? Maybe start with 3rm first then slowly upgrade,btohqsg
My parents era did that....2r 3R 5r,btohqsg
That's because you're looking at the most expensive one. There are many other cheaper places available,btohqsg
