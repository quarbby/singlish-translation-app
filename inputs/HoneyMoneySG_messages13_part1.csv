Hsbc revolution also no cover utility,btohqsg
Seem like amex true Cash back does,btohqsg
Haha. Edit mine post now Dbs live MoreSo shopping and online and and retail and super market -dbs liveSimply go dbs liveUtility amex true Cash Back,btohqsg
Wondering grab still will cover utility after 14oct,btohqsg
hsbc has put my application on hold for like 2 months now…,btohqsg
After 14 oct grab looks like more for on-line and f&b,btohqsg
Less for retailersYa hsbc one took doggy yrs to process,btohqsg
Amex & SCB I find it's faster,btohqsg
Maybank I find it's cmi processing,btohqsg
hsbc revo cover only white list of mcc  dun think that is more,btohqsg
U need to check the McC if u go there often,btohqsg
Cover most e-commerceLike Amazon shoppee Lazada example,btohqsg
ya dbs livefresh cover those as well,btohqsg
yea scb took about 2 days to approve  citi like almost same day. HSBC… is unbelievably slow and long and customer support is non existent :(,btohqsg
Seem like most cc don't cover utility,btohqsg
yes everything online/contactless are covered except those excluded. In fact it covers everything under hsbc revolution and more. Just that there is a smaller cap and there is minimum spend to meet.,btohqsg
only worth considering when there is promo,btohqsg
Ya it's more general compared to hsbc Revo is more specific with the MCC,btohqsg
Wondering if the yearly fee can get waived easy or not I heard some user encounter can't on dbs or posb cards,btohqsg
Guess if grab no more point on utility payment like power and mobile and on-line subcripion maybe need go switch to amex Liao since most common cc don't cover utility,btohqsg
think not all utility company accept Amex,btohqsg

With Frank ocbc nerf dino Evol uob and dbs live will get nerf next,btohqsg
Let say dbs live vs uob Evol which is better looks so similar,btohqsg
The uob Evol free grab voucher how is work? Add and top up into grab wallet?,btohqsg
Looks like both dbs live & uob Evol Cashback each catagory is around $300 or $250 need to spend to max out each catagory of $20 max CashbackSo if ovee shot it won't have more Cashback ane need to use another card,btohqsg
What good is uob Evol no fee to worry and call in to ask for fee waiver vs dbs live,btohqsg
I did a review awhile backhttps://youtu.be/kfCwHJdESVU,btohqsg
Ya ita the catalory one sometime hard to match or if overshot kinda bad,btohqsg
Must spend onlne and offlone to match up the Total min spending,btohqsg
does the dbs app have a way to track which categories you spent for using live fresh card?,btohqsg
Ya looks messy Ned do homework,btohqsg
The uob one Cashback of 50 100 300 is it total 3 month they give only $50 if we spent 500 each month for 3 mth?,btohqsg
And since it's calculate in 3 month let say I sign up In end October and I Nov then got the card so I left Nov Dec to chalk up the Cashback?,btohqsg
what credit card good to pay bill at axs ?,btohqsg
Hi can I check if anyone created webull account ? Is it good for fractional shares and is the platform easy to use ?,btohqsg
1st quarter  get 1/3 of cashback if clock 3rd month  2/3 if clock 2nd and 3rd month. btw now is $50/$100/$200 quarterly rebate  highest tier no more $300,btohqsg
I guess now is a nerf,btohqsg
So it's total $50 for 3 month,btohqsg
With this Nerf still worth it ?,btohqsg
not really  even uob evol is better unless spending lots on those merchants with bonus rebate like guardian/cold storage/giant/shopee/utilities/grab,btohqsg
But evol and DBs live need to track your spend like online and contactless,btohqsg
And category only max spending of $250 to 300,btohqsg
If we didn't spend at least $250 on a certain catagory then I guess can't meet the $600 min spending,btohqsg
Hi guys  how do I check when would my card spending limit would be reset for 10x rewards for Citi rewards card? As it’s only $1000/month,btohqsg
I recall SCb smart promotion rate for simply go ends in end of 2022,btohqsg
Then mostly is wont extend so either DBs live or uob evol is best bad for simply go,btohqsg
not much diff lah  uob one need to be sure to meet the spending for all 3 months of quarter.,btohqsg
Wonder ifIst month 5602nd month 7003nd month 900I suppose this consider as the tier 1 Cashback of $50,btohqsg
Unless we2nd optionIst month 10002nd month 10013nd month 1023I suppose this consider as the tier 2 Cashback of $100,btohqsg
