As long during the application  u are not is fine,btohqsg
I think this answered me if valid,btohqsg
End of the day if u can't bto is a good problem also,btohqsg
Aiya 1 of the people will resign because they over 14K ceiling then apply and book a hdb firstMy couple friend example: he ask her wife resign first and apply BTO  once book already wife go back to find job. So once u secure the flat booking paid the options fees done.After your income over 14K also no issue liao,btohqsg
Try to contact the admin for Acres?,btohqsg
Based on what i heard around so far  few months prior to key collection  there will be a renewal or final review of sortTo find out if there have been adverse changes to incomeDoubt loan eligibility will be cancelled but the amount eligible will be decreased,btohqsg
Should be based on time of applicationNearing key collection  supposedly> if income decreased - loan amount will be lowered> if income increased - loan amount stays the same,btohqsg
You don't have to apply for HFE since you belong to the HLE batchIn fact  don't really have to do anythingHDB will contact you when nearing key collection,btohqsg
Hopefully I can save enough money in my cpf liddat I no need take loan lol,btohqsg
Is it possible to ballot for another bto if u get a que number from previous launch?,btohqsg
If que not within the supply. Can?,btohqsg
Does anyone know what will happen to parent hdb if they pass away? Can the chidren still stay and change ownership?,btohqsg
Both or any one parties ?,btohqsg
If child has own hdb  have to dispose either one. If donâ€™t have then will inherit,btohqsg
Based on my understanding any 1 parties pass on the ownership will pass to thenext owner fully,btohqsg
If both pass on and there isnt any wills of inheritage HDB will interfer,btohqsg
They must inherit to u  meansnu become co owner  me too is like this but i get my own BTO then my MOM go law firm to put a will to sell the hdb and distribution the money equally to me and my 2 other slibings. If i die before my mom  my share will be to my son,btohqsg
When i get my own BTO I remove my name from my existing parents hdb as co owner,btohqsg
Ok tq. So if got 4 siblings  the hdb will be equally be put co-own by 4 names is it? What if 1 sibling waiting for a bto to complete?,btohqsg
If HDB take over they will put the house up for sales then share the amount equally to 4,btohqsg
But if there is wills  wills wills overright all decision,btohqsg
So better check previously did any one parties of your parent wrote a wills before,btohqsg
Or any siblings holding on to any wills,btohqsg
Ok. thank you for the answer. I will need to check. Islamic faraid is consider a will right?,btohqsg
I wouldnt know would it consider  as i am chinese my friend,btohqsg
And we only believe in law firm,btohqsg
Resign also no use cause its last 14mon income... Unless don't work for the last 14month then ur loan amt also go down,btohqsg
My concern not on the bto eligibility but more on hdb loan eligibility as my family gross income will slightly exceed $14k when in the key collection year. Hdb loan will give me more flexibility when want to pay off all remaining loan when i sold my existing flat. Not sure if hdb allow case by case consideration on this scenario.,btohqsg
Itâ€™s fine. Eligibility for HDB Loan is locked in already at the point of flat application,btohqsg
I was talking about loan eligibilityBased on time of applicationOnly if your income is lower when nearing key collection  as compared to when you signed your lease  there should be a concern,btohqsg
Wa u sure or not i mean the slibings don't get BTO meh ? Haha . I won't even want to be co own by my parents house because u are considered like u have a hdb and your chance of getting a Q number is slim.When i remove my name then i get a Q number. The first 3 tries all out of Q,btohqsg
Anyways just do a will la. Everyone's fair share . If never do will in the end fighting for the house for what  relationship spoiled,btohqsg
Unless your parents and your slibings already talked about whoever never get house go co own the current parents house. Then the other slibings is okay w that get their own house done,btohqsg
Ya. I think 2-3 sibling can co own. I already wait for bto. So no need to put my name. Just want to be clear about can inherit or not.,btohqsg
Yes correct. I did not mention this . Just out of job more then half a year and apply . Hdb will see u 6 months already out of job totally or just working part time can try to apply already  last time can now need 1 yr playlip not sure can or not,btohqsg
My mom have a hdb nowMy other 2 slibings and me already gotten BTO  last is me waiting for keys collectionAnd my mom already went to law firm with us 3 to the law firm the house sale proceed is spilt equally among the 3 of usHopes this help. But im not sure if no wills what will happen to the flat la,btohqsg
Can is can  but they still will see ur last 14mon income pattern...,btohqsg
Cue promotion for insurance agent with Will Management expertise ðŸ˜‚ time to get new client,btohqsg
Im HLE batch not HFE. HLE era will reassess loan eligibility before key collection. Not sure if now in HFE era  our HLE batch will follow HLE or HFE practice.,btohqsg
Thanks  that why i doubt if HDB will case by case consider my case.,btohqsg
Seniors are not restricted from getting 99 years lease for their 2R unitSuch as  because they want to leave the flat for their child(ren),btohqsg
Just let HDB contact you first for the review or renewal before you try to appeal anything  perhaps?Loan eligibility should be based on the time of application / lease signingJust make sure that your income is not lower than before  as it would be perceived as a decreased ability to repay the loan and thus loan amount eligible will also be lowered,btohqsg
I had wrote enquiry to hdb. Thanks for the advise.,btohqsg
I didn't know that. Else I'd have asked for 99 years lease when I selected my unit few years ago.  The officer didn't give me the option  and I was under the impression that seniors can only opt for short lease.  Sheeze... ðŸ˜’,btohqsg
Short lease is cheaper than 99 lease. But lower resale value,btohqsg
Your resale levy will be higher for 99y lease if applicable,btohqsg
What do u mean lower resale value? My understanding cant be sold in resale mkt.,btohqsg
I believe need more transparency from HDB. When my sis wanted to purchase a flat with a shorter lease  we were informed that the buyback price would be based on the purchase price  prorated for the unused lease period. However  we noticed whn the pty was made avail thru SBF  the purchase price for the next owner was based on the current mkt val.,btohqsg
Faraid is not a will. Muslim can only bequeath up to 1/3 (33.33%) of their total estate to non-heirs through their will (Wasiyat). Any attempt to bequeath > this limit is considered invalid. The remaining estate must be distributed to the heirs according to Faraid  ensuring immediate heirs receive their fixed shares (Share Certificate issued by Syariah Court).,btohqsg
Any idea how is the resale levy computed? Currently I have to pay $15k for a 30yr lease. Single occupancy.  Just curious as I don't think I can request for change after the agreement has been signed.,btohqsg
