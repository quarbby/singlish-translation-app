yes. Also in the same link,btohqsg
Yala so they cannot see their score what they just told that they won't the unlucky lottery and do u wanna excerise the option,btohqsg
i think if u pay to verify  u wun get the paper back  it is they relook at ur paper,btohqsg
huh? After they get their results slip leh,btohqsg
to discuss the procedures and how to base the grades with the prelim grades,btohqsg
It's all before they get their results I tot?,btohqsg
actually are prelim grades moderated by the school?,btohqsg
I literally just copied the specific  paragraph for u,btohqsg
It only said the results were similar to their prelims,btohqsg
for my school  they only moderated E and below,btohqsg
It didn't said it used their prelims,btohqsg
Answered in the link:For candidates who choose to sit for the re-examination  Cambridge Assessment and SEAB will count the better of the two grades  i.e. the better of the awarded grade and the re-examination grade  and this will be recorded as the final grade in their GCE O-Level result slip and certificate.,btohqsg
but i mean if basing off their prelims  it is gonna be moderated all grades,btohqsg
I didn't say used their prelims mah,btohqsg
I damn confused ngl I tot it was lost in Nov or smth,btohqsg
cnnt  frm what ik  ur o level results will be determined by ur prelim results and ur place in cohort  like they will take the avg or smtg like tst.,btohqsg
So their results they legit dk what,btohqsg
And I dun think they will be told their results,btohqsg
your class fucked up o level..say bye bye to your results,btohqsg
i would rather not risk it,btohqsg
the O lvl or A lvl one,btohqsg
Didn't they lose both around the same time,btohqsg
Also I think doesn't matter cuz both the results release is Jan or Feb,btohqsg
I literally copied the paragraph 😭,btohqsg
they will compare ur results with similar results from other candidates,btohqsg
actually i wonder if any parents took legal matters because of the lost papers,btohqsg
yathe moe link also mentioned that,btohqsg
normally ppl ck o levels to ensure a pass not to ensure a good grade from what i understand,btohqsg
whats with cambridge and them papers💀💀💀,btohqsg
wait then if they lost 1st round of mt paper how?,btohqsg
legit just need retake no other choice?,btohqsg
if your results all along E..until prelims  you ck or not also no considerable risk,btohqsg
H2 chem was 2017 batchO lvl was 2018 batch,btohqsg
In fact I think the alevel one is unaffected in terms of results release,btohqsg
If I go on the MRT and see a stack of Olevel Papers the first thing I do is sell each one on carosell,btohqsg
Cuz O and A lvl taken almost same timing mahdiffer by a bit,btohqsg
Yeah and oni olevel release earlier in Jan than A,btohqsg
So they got time to process... also goes to show how much buffer time they got,btohqsg
long long time ago  uncle era  O lvl results out end Feb to Mar,btohqsg
My special consideration request was radio silence for months than 1 week before the results release they tell u if u got approved,btohqsg
btw any of yall got go up during ur schs assembly or smth liddat for like a presentation,btohqsg
you dailo ah..go up do presentation for whole school,btohqsg
like racial harmony day or smth,btohqsg
that half the school is not interested in,btohqsg
she alr caught the american accent,btohqsg
that means 2k sgd is a ripoff,btohqsg
🤣 I mean each to their own I guess,btohqsg
might as well go rent an entire flat,btohqsg
This sounds like a mugging room,btohqsg
1 room hdb flat cannot meh,btohqsg
I mean yea 2k for that is on the higher end but still reasonable,btohqsg
You seen a one room before? There's no bedroom,btohqsg
A one room hdb is a living room+ kitchen,btohqsg
which mrt is it near to,btohqsg
Yea as I suspect it's not for long term lease,btohqsg
This is a hdb one room  one of the better ones,btohqsg
current hdb layout all vv small,btohqsg
The worst ones are where the one room is the size of that kitchen,btohqsg
Not as bad as the cage homes,btohqsg
At first I thought no advertising only applies to the study chat and not this until I reread the rules,btohqsg
That means tuition cannot recommend here even if ppl ask?,btohqsg
Oh ic so it’s stuff like property advertising that’s out of bounds,btohqsg
I'm very sure if people request should be ok,btohqsg
If not you gonna have people flooding the chat with tuition promos,btohqsg
But then like if ppl come here to self advertise their own tuition services that’s not allowed?@junghon3709,btohqsg
"yea then we shld change the name to ""SGExams advertisement group""",btohqsg
maybe got to seek admin perm first,btohqsg
I think private tuition services will be redirected to other channels,btohqsg
And these other channels have been vetted,btohqsg
You mean yes? Cos I said not allowed there,btohqsg
https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/s/5Ih7jSlTeihonestly can't tell whether this is satire,btohqsg
"I mean if people ask for services here and they get replies with "" sorry can't answer"" or ""sorry can't say here"". That's the fastest Convo ender in history",btohqsg
Better than light soya sauce in soft boiled eggs,btohqsg
Bruh.. the dark soya sauce is the only way,btohqsg
If it ain't brown it ain't good,btohqsg
Seen a mf pour that in to their Kopi C,btohqsg
Correct me.if I'm wrong but ain't the variety in their country even worse,btohqsg
im in cce its very boring,btohqsg
y is it called cce in jc,btohqsg
or she still sec sch wtf,btohqsg
bro I have to contact yappertron as the (cca i hate the most kuro don’t expose me),btohqsg
Directed to ppl in elite sch bc I can’t compare,btohqsg
Yes. In fact in some top tier JCs it’s the default and students have to appeal to not take 4H2,btohqsg
Unfortunately for me only Malays get half day today,btohqsg
I see E120 doing the thing gude does,btohqsg
Can I identify as a Malay today,btohqsg
Ok la maybe no half day but I can reward myself with an extra long lunch break,btohqsg
I’ll leave office for 2h and hope no one catches,btohqsg
(like gude tamago jc or bmtjc),btohqsg
I get office all day every day,btohqsg
ngl the workload is ok what,btohqsg
Gonna go out and have a rokok break with my abang and then later have sex at Blk 38 HDB staircase/s,btohqsg
Some Malays in my unit literally just go outside of the compound to smoke,btohqsg
i thought thats for jae  if your ip results too rabs they wont let you take 4h2,btohqsg
like you barely passed ip4 they will let you promote but not 4h2,btohqsg
Idk tho I heard in RJC that ppl have to appeal to not take 4H2,btohqsg
I mean it's a stereotype for a reason lmao,btohqsg
Also for whatever reason Malays are over represented at scdf (and I heard spf),btohqsg
oh my rgs friend said in rjc if your rgs/ri ip4 results too bad they will strongly encourage (ask you to) do 3h2,btohqsg
Oh maybe it’s for those IP students who do well they have to appeal to do 3H2,btohqsg
If results are bad as expected they will allow students to do 3H2 as default,btohqsg
I think all the JAEs would have good enough results to make 4H2 default,btohqsg
my sch kinda encourages ip to do 3h2 but most ppl do 4h2 anyway,btohqsg
Only DSA who miss the cop by far then maybe 3H2 is the default,btohqsg
Oh anyway yall smart I guess,btohqsg
i know ppl who got close to 4.0 (equiv of raw6) but do 3h2 1h1,btohqsg
Anyway can always drop at the end of J1,btohqsg
So if you don’t know what’s your weakest can have 4H2 as some kind of insurance,btohqsg
At least they know which subjects to go all in to get the A,btohqsg
Bad thing about 4H2 is that if you intend to just get 3H2 A you might have some kind of complacency and you might be wishy washy about what subject you want to drop  so one moment your attention goes to 3 subjects and the other moment it’s another set of 3 subjects so it’s always good to have in mind one subject you want to drop (should you need to),btohqsg
Like for examples if someone takes BCME  if one moment he wants to drop Econs then focuses everything on BCM but realises his bio is worse than Econs then after a while focuses on CME  his Econs may have alr suffered during that period where he neglected it,btohqsg
But the person intends to get 4H2 A from the get go cos they know they can cope then sure I guess,btohqsg
Cost benefit analysis for 4H2 vs no 4H2?,btohqsg
I thought in the end most RJC students will still not drop,btohqsg
Also they know that they’re not aiming to go to a place like Cambridge and just local uni so 3H2 would do,btohqsg
sorry my ori yesterday was pure brainrot,btohqsg
the dude next to me kept talking in skibidi toilet,btohqsg
bro probably has sex with family guy footage in the background,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorlegit just ask to change seats only  then i rmb i was v fervent with wanting to switch class  but the counsellor legit tried to imply that even if i trf to new class  it wont be any btr cuz what ifffff the new class also got ppl liddat,btohqsg
i wonder what happened if u call 999 while in sch,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorlike the cher doesnt even want me to switch classes even if i deadass want to  by telling me that it will not help me or something,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorand my friend from another class telling me that it will sorta be useless to trf to another class bc what if the 3 girls go n tell ppl in my new class bad things abt me to hate me as well,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorsince like u told me  the 3 girls who bullies me r infamous in the sch,btohqsg
"@Polarbearnextdoorlike one of the girls who bullies me legit told her friends from another class abt me  n when i walked pass her n her friends from another class in the canteen once  she was pointing at me and saying ""see thats her"" to her friends from other classes",btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdoorso what if the 3 bullies go n tell my new classmates shit things then i get bullied again,btohqsg
i legit have no faith in this sch at all,btohqsg
"but then again  its so funny cuz according to my friend from another class who have seen them before  he described them as looking like ""ah lians"" lmao",btohqsg
im just gonna not care atp if they legit dont care,btohqsg
not sure why they go n say shit like this sch got 0 tolerance for bullying then do nothing abt this  n this bullying is so much worse than when i was in sec n pri sch already,btohqsg
Can test and then tell me the results?,btohqsg
"might as well js be blunt n say ""we dont care  deal with it urself L bozo""",btohqsg

"🫠 A self-taught ""dentist"" who advertised her services on Carousell was fined for performing illegal dental work in hotel rooms in S'pore.She had claimed she was a dentist from M'sia.➡️https://bit.ly/3vJL4iqFollow us on@mothershipsg",btohqsg
I think dropping econs is the riskiest and most not worth because H2 econs and H1 econs the content is similar and the test structure is different UNLESS the person’s csq is doing ok  struggling heavily with essay  but it is really not worth,btohqsg
Tbh 4H2 is kinda a safety net if u dunno which of the subj u gonna struggle w (then can drop to h1 later but actually may be wasted la to suffer for it). Some ppl (im not sure of its accuracy / how true) say 4h2 provided u do well will give higher chances of scholarships,btohqsg
It is not a default  it is uk ‘peer pressure’  everyone takes 4h2 coz the school encourages it and ofc those ppl hv strong acad calibre.,btohqsg
No it actually is the default in RI. Like they need to appeal to not take 4H2,btohqsg
‘Not everyone starts with 4H2 in RI. Because there will be those who opt for 3H2+1H1 from the start  by choice. And there will be those who go in with DSA who didnt meet the L1R5 of a certain score told to them by the school  who will start with 3H2+1H1  not by choice.’,btohqsg
For HCI  taking 4H2 is not a given for everyone. For IP students  you need to meet a certain GPA at Sec 4  to read 4H2s at JC1. I'm not sure what the criteria is for JAE students.,btohqsg
How does that prove it’s not  default. Those students who enter via JAE have told me that they actually have to *appeal* to take 3H2,btohqsg
u can’t run away from shit,btohqsg
just face it don’t bother changing class legit,btohqsg
Maybe that person was capping but she said that when she was considering taking 3H2  she was told that she had to appeal,btohqsg
But for ejc do they make ppl who want to take 3H2s appeal? If their o level score/GPA was good,btohqsg
Cos that was what someone from Rjc told me but then it could be that she was capping,btohqsg
Anyway in top tier JCs more than 80% of students would just take 4H2,btohqsg
I think best cheer has to go the roquila,btohqsg
has to be the most racist,btohqsg
im legit planning to js stay,btohqsg
anyways the 3 girls who bully me dont seem to be taking sch srsly so hope they lose by retaining lor,btohqsg
💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀,btohqsg
bro the sagitar cheer is js gun noises wtf,btohqsg
no point dropping to H1 nowadaysat most just ignore the subject first. Its score no longer matter,btohqsg
It could still waste more lesson time though,btohqsg
And also they forced to sit for more papers,btohqsg
I hope she had the teeth drill,btohqsg
it's like I go take 183 credits for NUS engineering instead of 161cuz I'm more for learning,btohqsg
learning doesn't matter as much as doing well,btohqsg
might as well drop and do better in a H1 rather than get a shit H2 grade and let it be a H1 grade,btohqsg
I mean if the students consider dropping one subject in the first place  chances are it’s because they don’t understand the subject well and won’t absorb much in class,btohqsg
They would rather devote their energies into the remaining 3 subjects to ensure they can do well for them,btohqsg
not wrong  it's like those nus students who chose modules based on which ones were easier to score than which one is more interesting for learning,btohqsg
I'm just more into really learning,btohqsg
i would take more mods for learning if my faculty let me take extra physics ones,btohqsg
so in the end i just audit,btohqsg
wth got one cyclist think pavement is theirs ah. Then keep ringing the bell and then i tried siaming but then she also keep cycling in the direction i siamed to and then keep ringing the bell then angry,btohqsg
i wld take interesting mods if NTU lets me SU them(and im sure letting me SU core mods will improve my mental physical and emotional well being...),btohqsg
I was honestly confused what she wanted me to do coz she rang the bell signalling her presence  i tried siam-ing and she cycled in the direction i siam-ed and keep ringing the bell,btohqsg
shld let them knock u down thn u claim insurance/s,btohqsg
Maybe if i was empty handed i would consider just walking my own way and ignore the bell,btohqsg
But i was carrying food and im hungry,btohqsg
walking pedestrians are the lowest of the low  can only afford shoes smh,btohqsg
I wondered what will she do if i just continued my way,btohqsg
Pretend i didnt hear the bell,btohqsg
Then jn she stopped at frowned at me,btohqsg
cuz u deaf cnnt hear the bell,btohqsg
I saw her cycling zig-zag and ringing the well💀i dunno what to do,btohqsg
then you'd graduate with a degree in CC mods,btohqsg
Actually I accidentally hit a pedestrian before coz i just learnt and then not really stable yet then didnt stop in time coz it was a downslope,btohqsg
altho some ppl do rely on CC mods to pull gpa up,btohqsg
there's people that can only do core mods (me) then there's those that's saved by non-core mods,btohqsg
Tbh i take electives to pull up my score,btohqsg
I've seen a cyclist speed towards a turning log picking truck then blare their bells like no tomorrow,btohqsg
Like the truck was at fault,btohqsg
No i just saw her frown but the bell was CRAZY,btohqsg
i kinda got lucky bc most of my non-cores are MOOC,btohqsg
then i had an SU sem bc covid,btohqsg
Like at higher frequency than my alarm clock,btohqsg
i want a SU sem too.,btohqsg
i only had two electives i didn't SU,btohqsg
????? Tbh after learning to drive  i are cyclist is kinda a burden to motorist,btohqsg
one was y1s1 where i didn't expect a B-,btohqsg
second was covid sem where i knew i'd have an A,btohqsg
This problem is universal  occurs everywhere,btohqsg
so 6/30 AUs was letter graded,btohqsg
as both a cyclist and a driver  u can be a cyclist who ain't a burden to drivers,btohqsg
Yea saw acts of cyclist waving their hands when turning to warn drivers like blinkers,btohqsg
i want to su my core mods,btohqsg
Yes but i cant be on the road i cant cycle within the 2 yellow lines lol,btohqsg
I cant imagine me in a vulnerable bicycle (no shield) beside a car and what not,btohqsg
dunnid cycle within 2 yellow lines la ngl as long as  you're cycling in a straight line and not taking up too much of the road can liao imo,btohqsg
if you intentionally go cycle in a busy as fuck road during peak period then,btohqsg
Honestly everytime I see cyclist or motorcyclist cycle between two vehicles irregardless of size,btohqsg
unless u can keep up w the flow of traffic,btohqsg
I always think  they are looking for death,btohqsg
I cant cycle in straight line so only place i can cycle is a pcn / park lol…i use the manuerve motion to balance,btohqsg
ya i do want to die pls knock me over and kill me,btohqsg
I actually had an accident in ecp lol,btohqsg
anw on road u shld only be on a road bike imo,btohqsg
mountain bikes can't go fast enough on roads,btohqsg
Coz i just finished learning and a group of ppl accelerated down the slope and i couldnt siam in time,btohqsg
No the one near c4 bicycle rental,btohqsg
i only know i hate the bridge,btohqsg
Dun really know the pleasure they receive being on the road vs on pavements,btohqsg
Saw a cyclist in the middle lane before,btohqsg
road can go faster for longer,btohqsg
Prob adrenaline  the same adrenaline that makes people race down the highway at 2x the speed of cop cars in a chase,btohqsg
I cant  the fear will make me slower💀💀,btohqsg
Tomato Potato either ways got money for free if bang,btohqsg

Why the route through tamp so weird one,btohqsg
"singapore does absolutely nothing to make it actually ""car lite"" and encourage alternate transaportation",btohqsg

Adulting is hard?Many students in Singapore feel unqualified and intimidated by the transition to working life  a survey shows.But there're ways working adults can help them  says a NUS lecturer.Read what he has to say:https://cna.asia/3Jeghxr,btohqsg
your body isn’t used to it yet,btohqsg
Just take 4h2 and drop in term2,btohqsg
it takes time to adjust to a different body clock,btohqsg
wah kj police camp all j book out,btohqsg
Yeah also can. But now that I tried to find their subject combi booklet I believe that person I talked to was capping since RJC’s website mentions nothing about making 4H2 default  they only said the requirements for 4H2,btohqsg
wait my spf friend book out last friday,btohqsg
idt 4h2 would be default since moe states that 3h2 i the default,btohqsg
Idk where irwen lives but if he say west  I would assume it's near cck,btohqsg
Or at least near that whole adventure camp area of the west,btohqsg
It is now my 2h gp period,btohqsg

Depends on school but as the name suggest a club that allows you to enjoy facilities like a clubhouse complete with pool table and digital games,btohqsg
