2.0T fast will be AMG A45s!,btohqsg
Or yolo Yaris GR also can. 1.6T haha,btohqsg
Again depends on how much you want to spend and what you're requirements are. The price range really spread out,btohqsg
Hahah I am looking at swift sport 1.4M   accord and civic 1.5 T,btohqsg
New ah? Accord and civic quite ex now with COE,btohqsg
Can try V40 T2  stage 1 190hp which is pretty powerful,btohqsg
Colt Version R 1.5T with a 5 speed.,btohqsg
V40 I saw just concern on the maintenance,btohqsg
I saw new BMW 116i got offer price now at 138k or something you can take a look,btohqsg
ah.. my experience with a S60 from the same generation pretty okay.. parts might be slightly more expensive but then again  Volvos seldom breakdown.,btohqsg
Can the owner of this Mercedes please stand up,btohqsg
they are the same in that era. light  fast and small,btohqsg
i know where this car is. gonna ask him if he wants to sell,btohqsg
inside is fabric checkered style seats,btohqsg
paying 138k for a 3 cylinder front wheel drive car? that aint bmw hallmark,btohqsg
It's still a entry level bmw with 1.5L twin turbo  which was what the original question ask for,btohqsg
why not consider a proper used car or bmw,btohqsg
Some people prefer new cars  so why not,btohqsg
with good power. rear wheel bmw,btohqsg
"a ""new"" car becomes old after buying it",btohqsg
Lol whatever rocks your boat  just giving options,btohqsg
Most driver now just look for brand   give them an a1 over altis they choose a1,btohqsg
Alot of myths abt 3cylinder cars. Personal feel is the vibration tends to be higher as compared to 4,btohqsg
it is like choose between a brand NEW bezza and a good used car  the inexperienced ones will choose NEW,btohqsg
Whats a good used bezza kar to intro,btohqsg
for sure it is more difficult to balance 3 cylinders. it is considered entry model.,btohqsg
you dont buy bezza at all. used or new.,btohqsg
you buy a proper 4 cylinder engine car like a toyota honda or mazda,btohqsg
or bmw if you dont mind the ownership costs,btohqsg
if you are a beginner and do not want the headache  get a good used japanese car.,btohqsg
Only like japanese girls not cars ü´£,btohqsg
Enjoy petrol cars as much as one can now. Once 2040  many become scrap metals unless keep like vintage cars. üòÖ,btohqsg
a bmw has many issues - sensor faults ,btohqsg
What about those with repair done with receipts to proof that these wear n tear are replaced,btohqsg
the question now is - when will new faults appear? and need replacements. if you understand bmw well  then ok.,btohqsg
Isnt all used car e same. Wear and tear bound to happen and subject to sensor faults also,btohqsg
electronic sensors  o2 sensor  abs sensors  oil sensor etc,btohqsg
Theres no bulletproof car that can last forever. Maybe a mazerati lol ü§î,btohqsg
yes a mazda lasts a very time - without faults. dont laugh. it is ture,btohqsg
How u define better? U done stress test against all e brands alrdy?,btohqsg
Most cars last longer than 10-yrs. if not you don‚Äôt see many renew coe instead of getting new. üòÖ,btohqsg
i have owned both bmws and mazda and toyota and i know. in my 4 years of toyota vios  i replaced a fan motor  and a water pump. they are not expenisve,btohqsg
better means you dont spend time in workshops doing parts replacements. faults  sensors i alrerady mentioned.,btohqsg
Me noob. Wanna buy used car. Need to learn frm the experts like u üòè,btohqsg
i have a december 2015 mazda and i checked all the bills  and the guy hasnt spent anything on parts other than regular servicing,btohqsg
Then the new problems are caused by that owner,btohqsg
this two comparisons is good enough to iluustrate to you about reliability,btohqsg
i am the new owner. i bought it second hand this year. i am third owner and after driving nearly 10000km absolutely troubletree,btohqsg
I wonder anyone did a comparison of AD workshop prices over the years,btohqsg
