It will take some time to reflect de based on last year experience,btohqsg
Want to ask    book flight which credit card is the best? N90 master is that worth to use to book?,btohqsg
I already see the $3 rebate in Amex tcb for purchase on 4 Aug,btohqsg
Amex direct card is different from bank issue card,btohqsg
I have the Ocbc 90n. There is no best card to book flight. The cardinal considerations are your spending scenario in totality and your preference for miles or cashback. For me  there are better card than Ocbc 90n to book flights unless there is am ongoing promotion.,btohqsg
Hi thanks for replying  so normally what u use ocbc 90n as?,btohqsg
Depends your monthly spend  if you spent like 1k / mth  the miles should be enough,btohqsg
I seldom use ocbc 90n except when I travel. I pair 90n to my Amaze card and use it for travel related spendings.For context  I applied ocbc 90n during its launch before pandemic during a promo when they gave many miles per dollar.,btohqsg
what other cards are a good alternative for OCBC 365 card?,btohqsg
Okay  so uob absolute Amex will take more time ya,btohqsg
Hi guys  for OCBC360 saving account. Need a min of $1800 as salary credit. Will I still enjoy the interest rate if i transfer 1.8k via paynow from another bank to the OCBC saving account every mth?,btohqsg
Ahh  even if I include ‚Äú giro-salary‚Äù under the remarks?,btohqsg
Anyone tried zym mobile? How is their service and 4g signal so far?,btohqsg
As far as I know doesn‚Äôt work for OCBC,btohqsg
Ohh cos I‚Äôm self employed so I was wondering how to yield the interest?,btohqsg
Need a corporate account to transfer salary to ur OCBC,btohqsg
Open a sole proprietorship company & bank account then transfer to yourself. Write off some of your expenses under company account as well.,btohqsg
If not use UOB? Think that one u can use paynow to trf,btohqsg
Since u self employed  then open 1 lo,btohqsg
For ocbc interest  from what I know should be need to use Giro transaction type and purpose/transaction code must be SALA for ocbc salary crediting,btohqsg
Unless I get my own Bank to auto deduct $1.8k every mth to ocbc? Does it work that way? Or also can‚Äôt,btohqsg
Think maybe can. U can try as long is giro and make sure the transaction code (4 chars code) is SALA,btohqsg
Credit salary to ownself. 1.8k monthly.Year end report as income 21.6kGov still give u subsidy,btohqsg
Like that buy car buy house cannot leh. Very easy ah gong will come find you.,btohqsg
Car use company name to buy. Offset as asset.Give u higher loan amt also,btohqsg
Laaa Lai review how to create a company hahahaha,btohqsg
hah tried to go online to set up giro transaction. cant find ocbc as a billing org tho,btohqsg
Hello all  I‚Äôm an existing user of moo2 even though I‚Äôm not using it till I saw the moo moo cash plus promo. May I ask if I have to fund the 50k by end of August to enjoy the $381 interest?And I have to make sure I activate the smart save buy into Fullerton sgd cash?,btohqsg
Will the interests be credited on a daily basis or at the end of the 1 month?As well  any videos on how I can withdraw it after 1 month?Sorry this probably may have been asked a million times here  if there‚Äôs any videos I can watch would appreciate if someone can direct me to those YT videos.

What‚Äôs considered a buy trade? Since to be honest I have nothing I plan to buy right now  it‚Äôs hard to make 7 trades..,btohqsg
Think u may need to call and check w your bank how to go about doing it alternatively if u can‚Äôt set it online.If your bank say really has to use corporate bank acct like what others has mentioned  then bo bian,btohqsg
Is Subscribing into Fullerton sgd cash considered a buy trade?,btohqsg
Someone else just asked this morninghttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/120917,btohqsg
Thanks.  as long as it‚Äôs 7 buy trades of any amount I should stil be entitled to the 5.8% or it has the be 7 buy trades of the full 50k that was deposited in?,btohqsg
7 buy trades of min S$1 SGD per order,btohqsg
Ok thanks so I can buy and sell it after 1 month as well.. or can do so immediately?,btohqsg
Up to you  i sold immediately after buying 7x,btohqsg
Ohh okay hahah thank you! üòÜ,btohqsg
But 5 times  so need to break down 50k into cash plus just 7 times and reduce the amount to slightly lesser than 10k since that‚Äôs the limit. Right?,btohqsg
$381 is separate from what one will earn when putting the funds into cash plus? Or it‚Äôs already inclusive?,btohqsg
