Coz the 1st time i started conversing to a real japanese in japan  i got a bit nervous and scared,btohqsg
I think I kinda can pronounce some of the words ok,btohqsg
But it's those that I legit hear alot,btohqsg
I think the difficulty is japanese speaks really fast,btohqsg
eh but the real qn shld be,btohqsg
So learning it is one thing  but being able to converse  like hold a conversion w a japanese is another,btohqsg
How much on anime merch will I be allowed to spend this time,btohqsg
The record last yr is approx $100 sgd,btohqsg
My sis just spends on whatever she wants,btohqsg
This yr might get even worse,btohqsg
Even right fr the first day,btohqsg
Cuz I'll prolly have part time money too,btohqsg
I got quite a few things iw la,btohqsg
I think of all the places we visited as a family  we spend q a lot on shopping in jpn compared to other places,btohqsg
- food- skincare- makeup- anime merch,btohqsg
I dun recall buying anything in nz actually,btohqsg
Think my parents also thought abt going china,btohqsg
Yes skincare products (selected few) are cheaper in jpn,btohqsg
But kena vetoed cuz realise my sis will complain abt food,btohqsg
Japan got so much weird and wonderful gadgets to spend money on,btohqsg
Lol i also cant eat chn food,btohqsg
My mum spends a lot on dior coz the prices compared to sg is ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Bro anessa sunscreen i cannot eh,btohqsg
We also gonna get the hair mask,btohqsg
Dior is like $50-60 cheaper over thereðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
That gotta suck when y'all travel,btohqsg
And when i was there  there was like tax free + 5% off for tourists,btohqsg
She don't like herbalised food ah,btohqsg
I mean if u big decent amounts u can also get it Duty Free too,btohqsg
Yea it is tat much cheaper before tax free,btohqsg
So w the additional 15% disct  it is even much cheaper than sg,btohqsg
Sadly i m not discipline in skin care but omo im starting to,btohqsg
My dad pushed planning to me n it sucks planning,btohqsg
Face wash + hado lobo lotion thingy,btohqsg
I took 2 weeks of whole days,btohqsg
Meh I have to plan so many sch shit alrd ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Atp might as well make use of my training ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
But btw re u planning to take train in hokkaido or someone drives,btohqsg
No one in my family drives,btohqsg
Coz be prepared the trains in hokkaido is not like the ones in tokyo / kansai,btohqsg
And hokkaido is much bigger than any part of japan,btohqsg
The trains are still on time but it is just slower to get fr one place to another due to how big hokkaido is,btohqsg
And some are less frequent (unless u are in main sub prefectures such as sapporo),btohqsg
Prolly gonna stick to Sapporo eh tbh,btohqsg
So important to check train departure timings  u dw to waste time at the train stn,btohqsg
How is your day today Musician,btohqsg
How many days are u catering for and ideally which parts of hokkaido?,btohqsg
I haven't plan that detailed yet,btohqsg
But shld be 5 days hokkaido,btohqsg
