Solution is to either increase the speed limit  or put a lot more speed cameras,btohqsg
Tbh I feel like some places the speed limit could be higher,btohqsg
hearsay last time around early 2000s  they did a trial on ecp  increased speed limit to 110 for 6 months. but then reverted back,btohqsg
regarding the more speed cameras part  they are actually doing smth about it soon,btohqsg
where do y find these syickers,btohqsg
what is tall  skinny and fragile in condition,btohqsg
stop w all tge stupid jokes ah,btohqsg
If u act do this coke will come out ur nose,btohqsg
if uw u can test it,btohqsg

ok i sent so much skull that it became text msg,btohqsg
Exactly la tbh I think u can understand also traffic flows is actually kinda cool as it conforms to some laws of flow and motion lol as a unit,btohqsg
Intro speeding motorcycle going 20-30km faster than rest of traffic,btohqsg
I also did a few readings on crowd control as well bruh lmao that's just thermodynamics,btohqsg
idk bro my iChat they never send,btohqsg
for some ppl energy drinks makes them more sleepy,btohqsg
my dad drinks Red Bull everyday,btohqsg
Bruh my bus literally hit the largest pothole,btohqsg
Bro hr is as high as my ping,btohqsg
His blood pressure as high as my ping,btohqsg
Hmm. There are conflicting studies about whether changing the speed limits increases or reduces the frequency of accidents. One which said increasing it slightly wonâ€™t and it has something to do with psychology. If the speed limit is too low  people will tend to speed far over the limit because they think itâ€™s unreasonable. If itâ€™s too high  more prone to accidents since vehicles canâ€™t break. So I guess we need to find the sweet the spot. If they donâ€™t want to make the speed limit too high  no choice but to put speed enforcement cameras in a lot more places,btohqsg
I hope it actually works in reducing traffic accidents then,btohqsg
But I rly think some roads the speed limit could be upped by at least 10,btohqsg
so exhausted  thank goodness there's a long weekend,btohqsg
Last time our public buses can go up to 100mph,btohqsg
When the new buses car out in the 2000s  they added a limiter to all public buses. Limiting them to 60mph,btohqsg
I guess it rly depends on the roads. And also for red light cameras to be effective  rly need to put a lot. If not gonna have that kind of accident which Xavier described whereby drivers suddenly break in order to avoid getting caught by the cameras.,btohqsg
Yeah thatâ€™s why if you read my msg  I said itâ€™s about finding the sweet spot,btohqsg
Some roads Iâ€™m quite sure increasing by 10 more is perfectly fine,btohqsg
Now they are adding limiters to the lorry's and trucks you see,btohqsg
actually speed limits for certain roads and vehicles used to be lower,btohqsg
e.g. vans and small lorries used to be limited to 60  kpe used to be limited to 70  other expressways limited to 80,btohqsg
Speed limit are effectively more like speed suggestions,btohqsg
Often 80 is just effectively 85 on a highway because of flow if u strictly follow 80 that might be fine but depends on time of day whereby the flow can be a lot faster.,btohqsg
yes. if u follow speed limit on lane 1  especially during free-flow conditions  everyone will hate u lol,btohqsg
Yeah so depends lor gotta balance regulation and flow and the speed limit is just there as a suggestion and speed cameras even in normal operations leds to a deliberate slow down in flow for like 1km before and after the cam.,btohqsg
Which is intended cuz if u look at cam placements it's often on s curve high incline bends which legit is better if u slow down,btohqsg
as far as i know. the only vehicles left in sg without speed limiters are cop cars,btohqsg
this can go up to 150km/h i believe,btohqsg
without a limiter  this van would have outran that corolla in speed,btohqsg
Oh nice so they did actually increase some permanently,btohqsg
will b enough to net a C-B if you keep practising,btohqsg
What particularly are u struggling with,btohqsg
nothing I just want to secure A for my upcoming wa,btohqsg
I just scared i mess up my factor analysis for ss/dd shifts,btohqsg
More of reading the model answers as a guide to familiarise urself with the answering structure and to get a better understanding what is required for the qns,btohqsg
But need to make sure u understand the content first and bridge any gaps u may hv,btohqsg
U need to have good content basis first before u can go into the analysis part,btohqsg
Maybe try to break down the qns and do it step by step to avoid mistake,btohqsg
Itâ€™s true even if a student canâ€™t understand the Econs concepts very well  there usually would be enough standard qns such that brute force memorisation would be able to get a student at the very least a C,btohqsg
