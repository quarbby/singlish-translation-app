Therein  the problem with our education system,btohqsg
Why do Singaporeans all feel so compelled to win?,btohqsg
When they charge that high  they r pre empted to deliver their content in a specific manner too  such that students who hate the subject can digest,btohqsg
To keep climbing higher and higher at all costs?,btohqsg
Huh but grades matter no?? üòÖ,btohqsg
Can say the same thing for all other ASEAN countries,btohqsg
A level tuition teacher? MOE teacher?About O levels  UK universities look at your O level or equivalent certificate  even though it has long passed. And not L1R5  but a percentage of A1 and maybe A2.,btohqsg
I would rather not go crazy trying to get into Cambridge  and have a decent mental health attempting for NUS,btohqsg
Yes ure two points r so spot on üò¢üò¢üò¢ u know how much i struggled haha.. fed with half truth  and lack of materials,btohqsg
Erm  I think Singaporeans are quite laid back. Look at south korea. They work like crazy,btohqsg
Enter uni courses lorAnd thats almost evthg alr no?,btohqsg
South Korea is what I don‚Äôt want Singapore to be,btohqsg
Even Chinese is no match for South Korea,btohqsg
I find a lvls a breeze tbh,btohqsg
‚ÄúOnce you get degree‚Äù  I said,btohqsg
Of course. South Korean students attend cram schools on weekends for the whole day and on weekdays until past midnight,btohqsg
Sleep like 4 hours a day,btohqsg
Hahaha thats a whole new topic of discussion alr thenBut being competitive has is justifications too... it is one of the keys to survival,btohqsg
NUS is pretty easy to be honest. If you have Singapore A levels,btohqsg
Competition at the cost of collaboration,btohqsg
there's only competition if you care about it,btohqsg
In fact is not even a choice... the tide will either move us forward or push us to the bottomSo we may only pick the lesser of the 2 evils,btohqsg
even if you go to some top uni,btohqsg
and you see people smart af,btohqsg
I was accepted within a week. NTU under 48 hours. When I applied for UK it took so long  I have to prepare so much.,btohqsg
Yeah NUS just fill out one form then u done,btohqsg
why is moving forward an evil tho,btohqsg
Icic i get what u mean,btohqsg
Ok... so how many As is considered good to them?,btohqsg
Easy in the form of application,btohqsg
Cambridge uni life is better than NUS,btohqsg
I think someone said it before,btohqsg
The bell curve is less steep in cambridge,btohqsg
And less mods to study per sem,btohqsg
More importantly you get A for the subject you are teaching,btohqsg
U r saying this bcos nus is recognized enuff.. if today sg has lack of world renowned universities  maybe ur options will be different,btohqsg
is not abt this aha.... u try doing nothing for 1 yr straight... u will get depressed,btohqsg
Some tuition teachers pride themselves in taking that A level subject every year,btohqsg
Have you seen Cambridge tripos papers? It's crazy!!!,btohqsg
They only have one exam at the end of the year. So everything else doesn't count,btohqsg
I mean  idm putting in more effort if I'm doing something I like,btohqsg
Yes üòÇüòÖ but sgpreans have sky high expectation.. dunno where they get that from üòÇ,btohqsg
Of course they would be relaxed until exams come,btohqsg
No wonder so many depression suicides üò∞üò∞üò∞,btohqsg
They fight hard to feel accepted,btohqsg
Really? A is not sky high at all. 100% perfect mark on a notoriously hard exam is sky high,btohqsg
We are lucky that A levels only uses grades. Not actual raw scores,btohqsg
Oh ok sorry overlooked. But in order to get a degree  the alevel grades so impt,btohqsg
Bell curve or moderation is good.,btohqsg
Yes i see where u coming from üôÉ,btohqsg
