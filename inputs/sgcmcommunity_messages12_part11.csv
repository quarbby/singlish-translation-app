Yes yes! This is very good initiative from the company. I share many of my friends go try already. All very happy.,btohqsg

Some would say it is unsafe,btohqsg
Sure. This is the bmw m5 class. Large engine powerful torque abs power,btohqsg

Actually engine loves it when you revv long at bear redline. Blasts put carbons. And becomes very efficient,btohqsg
Highway running engine usually is very good,btohqsg
good mann  cant be an NA V8 from the E92.. love to have one but scared of rod bearings,btohqsg
M3 is 2 door. Not practical,btohqsg
i love e63 man! 5.5l v8 cannot be topped bro!,btohqsg
Anything practical if you say no to a few people üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I believe he is referring to the very new brand tesla in Singapore. The ceo is Elon musk very talented young man.,btohqsg
Rod bearings issue is commonly discussed but I didn‚Äôt do it. I think those drivers didn‚Äôt heat up engine oil properly first. Why? Because the v8 takes a real long time to heat up. 8.8 liters of oil,btohqsg
So if oil is not properly warmed up and you whacked the engine bearings failure,btohqsg
I‚Äôm my case it takes nearly 5 minutes to achieve ‚ÄúOK‚Äù temperature status,btohqsg
And it takes 10W60 thick oil. Even worse right. Takes longer time to travel,btohqsg
But once oil is hot yeah revv all you want. That‚Äôs why suitable for track use,btohqsg
Elon not young and tesla is 10Plus years le just young in sg,btohqsg
drive safe everyone! going to join my friends to go rounding now! slow legal cruise! my WRX warm up finish alr!,btohqsg

don‚Äôt pretend la. i like to hear your flat 6 roar haha,btohqsg
I wish I can. Bmw doesn‚Äôt recommend this probably it cannot withstand high temperature when use on track. I mean the viscosity may not be enough,btohqsg
No wonder your nick Winner. Coz always on track.,btohqsg
Do newer turbo engines use thinner oils? It‚Äôs better actually for cold start,btohqsg
This one maybe I check in with cycle and carriage before sharing this information as I'm not aware üòÖ. I'm just a driver,btohqsg
Shell brand I hear they‚Äôre using,btohqsg
I want to try Motul leh,btohqsg
Motul is very good üëç  but need change every 6000km. Not good for my mazda 3 cause I now do part time PHV very high mileage.,btohqsg
How about you for your 3,btohqsg

I heard Mazda Automatic Transmission Fluid (ATF FZ) SKYACTIV lifetime one. No need to change.,btohqsg
I also do grab food. Selection very good and yummy.,btohqsg
I've yet to try. Maybe one day I'll try when times are better.,btohqsg
Where got so good one? Can I change to their brand too?,btohqsg
Bmw brand engine oil. I think they probably work with Castrol,btohqsg

There‚Äôs a Reddit forum American users use 7 years doing 200000 miles without changing. But asked if need to change. He says trans as smooth as day 1,btohqsg
