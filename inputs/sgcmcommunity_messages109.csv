cannot let some middleman earn the fee,btohqsg
now lowest rate is ocbc right?,btohqsg
i check ocbc is 2.78% according to their website,btohqsg
Standby 1 week time  usually takes around that,btohqsg
Your interest rate also depends on how much you down - J,btohqsg
Depends if you parf or COE,btohqsg
2 days to 5 days that is,btohqsg
mine is Parf and my dp is abt 38% of the total price so.. should be rather fine,btohqsg
loan amt is less than 50k,btohqsg
Ok  2 to 5 days should be good enough if you're not high risk,btohqsg
In the meantime since you want to speed up the process,btohqsg
i got quoted abt 1.5k for 0% NCD,btohqsg
i got quoted 2k despite 7 yrs driving experience with 0 accidents,btohqsg
but yes this. i assume ur car less than 1800cc?,btohqsg
take singlife if can haha  i prefer their one. if u do mods dont need report/ covered as long as legal,btohqsg
Many insurers refuse to insure certain brands,btohqsg

since you have 7 years driving ex,btohqsg
their usual age slabs are 18-22  22-26  26-35  40+,btohqsg
you can see the same being reflected in rentals and excess terms as well,btohqsg
Looks like a civic to me 🤪,btohqsg
Sure sold out.Definitely， there are 100 buyer with too much cash,btohqsg
https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS8hnKwvf/Audi didn't deploy airbag on the first impart after crashing down the door😱,btohqsg
the bumper wasn't pushed back hard enough to hit the airbag sensor,btohqsg
you see the middle of the bumper still intact,btohqsg
So  car cheaper than laptops in China. Interesting. Maybe can move work in rice padi,btohqsg
No need laptop can drive nice car,btohqsg
Don’t complain. I got 7 years when I first got my car in SG and kena 4.8k for a 2L car,btohqsg
they never took into account your experience did they?,btohqsg
just see engine size  brand and age and whack,btohqsg
I was shock 😲Thought only such barbarians behaviour stays in the North  like Beijing. This is Shanghai 😱,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice guys. Now need another piece of advice  better to take bank loan or in-house loan? I see that bank loan interests are lower.,btohqsg
bank is better if you have no issues securing it,btohqsg
see what works best for you based on interest rate and your credit profile,btohqsg
the dealer can go look for you as well as they do earn a commission on it,btohqsg
they wouldn't be opposed to it,btohqsg
yeah unless you have a long standing relationship with one that you can leverage for better terms,btohqsg
As long you pay on time,btohqsg
I think just go bank ask for full loan more better,btohqsg
Wait. Is this for car engine?,btohqsg

Such character should be ban for driving for life! They might perceive their lives as cheap and disposable but not other productive road users or pedestrians! No shame from their mugshot!,btohqsg
I am curious if the last Toyota Alphard is also prosecuted lol,btohqsg
anybody know the motor show at suntec  do they mainly sell cars or will sell car wash / accessories?,btohqsg
But there's booths by sonax and a few others,btohqsg

I tot plane .. I tot bird… it’s a civic type R with@awj_moodinside,btohqsg
Basket! I was driving along the SLE n slowed down at the speed cam to 88km/hr then kena flash - J,btohqsg
I return back  drive at 85km/hr also kena flash - J 😡,btohqsg
The speed limit there is 80?,btohqsg
Most speed cam zones 80 or 60 from what I've seen,btohqsg
it's  normal. If you do a search. That camera 📸 something like this. But don't think you will receive letter.https://youtu.be/mkwj-PuFR9A,btohqsg
No wonder the traffic comes to a crawl there,btohqsg
Maybe phantom driving very fast beside u,btohqsg
Hahaha don’t worry! I kena also 🤣,btohqsg
Did you smile for the cam? 🤭🤭,btohqsg
You know the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results..?,btohqsg
Okay but on a serious note  is this why people slow down all the way to like 70 or even 60 on BKE?,btohqsg
But if your meter points at 85km/hr  your speed isn't. Its lower.,btohqsg
Idk why people don’t know how to look,btohqsg
But the speed limit is 90,btohqsg
People thought it’s the same as the PIE one,btohqsg
KPE is just a sad series of bad planning,btohqsg
But the BKE one…people keep slowing waaaaaay down  which annoys me so much,btohqsg
But but… what if I use larger rims with higher profile tyres!! 🤓,btohqsg
That depends on your level of over read though,btohqsg
Larger more better!!!! Smaller gap to fender too. Like cool only!,btohqsg
That reminds me of a story,btohqsg
A man was driving down the road. He passed a traffic camera and saw it flash.Astounded he had been caught speeding when he was doing the speed limit  he turned around and  going even slower  he passed the camera.Again he saw it flash. He couldn’t believe it!So he turned and  going at a snail’s pace  he passed the camera.Again he saw the camera flash. He guessed it must be faulty  so home he went.Four weeks later he received three traffic fines in the mail  all for not wearing a seat belt.,btohqsg
Lol. I always wear my seat belt!,btohqsg

base model for.the masses. minimum specs,btohqsg
sg dealers need to stop cheating us on the specs,btohqsg
have ah? thought they list the specs clearly one?,btohqsg
then buyer happily sign and pay,btohqsg
unless you mean the misrep then that is a slightly different story :)))))))),btohqsg
Bid for the car  retain the plate  sell the car and then sell the plate,btohqsg
As in stop offering us base specs at such a high price,btohqsg
Technically that’s not cheating sir 😅,btohqsg
Imagine I put EVS on an ICE car! Woohoo!!!!!!!,btohqsg
Ultimate insult right. Must put it on a V8 gas guzzler some more,btohqsg
That one must ask boss man@FatFingers15,btohqsg
Wait.. what gas guzzler… it doesnt matter!! It should be smiles and joy giver wahahahahahah,btohqsg

Curious how does the qn 'is there rust on the car' let you know whether the guy is a true car enthusiast,btohqsg
True car enthusiast will just send for PPI,btohqsg
You tell me car no rust I also won't believe  so I don't bother to ask,btohqsg
To be honest my fc is 6.5km/L. Wouldn’t consider it a gas guzzler haha,btohqsg
"Imagine a VW Kombi from the 60s spotting ""EVS1L"" plate in SG on classic veh scheme",btohqsg
His is 4L V8!!!! 🔥 🔥,btohqsg
Some other brands I’ve seen cars get to 4+KM/L,btohqsg
It all depends on how the cars are tuned la,btohqsg
Tuning?? I heard someone say illegal leh,btohqsg
I think his m3 no need tune bah already so high performance le. Unless he wants to do the VROOOMMMM PAP PAP PAP PAP PAP,btohqsg
Tuning is just adjusting air fuel ratio and firing timing,btohqsg
Yeap. Optimisation is the best. Like computers softwares and stuff. Most cars arent optimised nowadays. Optimise is not equivalent to meeting emission standards.. sometimes😂,btohqsg
"Problem with lower powered cars <2L displacement  is that the stock hardware severely limits how ""hard"" you can tune",btohqsg
And many times to make the car perform to the owner's satisfaction have to use some gray area mods and straight up illegal mods,btohqsg
hi  need advice on car insurance. the brokers recommend comprehensive plans from NTUC  Bubblegum (MoneySmart) and Etiqa with similar coverage  so far anyone with plans from these companies? thanks!,btohqsg
Get a quote from budget direct also,btohqsg
They don't use brokers so usually they won't appear,btohqsg
moneysmart i tot got singlife also?,btohqsg
if not try sgcarmart insurance quotes also,btohqsg
i tried sgcarmart  motorist  moneysmart..my current is with DirectAsia  and they are even higher than the 3 quoted.. have not tried Budget  will ask them,btohqsg
I think depends on what we are trying to optimise it for. Hahahahahha. Manufacturer deliver the engine also optimised for different target from enthusiasts,btohqsg
Manufacturer usually under tune from engine maximum potential to suit emmision standards,btohqsg
As a side effect  which is good for them also  the wear of the car is less,btohqsg
better for owners too... there's a compromise usually between reliability and performance,btohqsg
funny are those who squeeze performance and whack the car  then complain car lame. Keep leaking or breaking down,btohqsg
I am sure the engineers who designed and built the powerplant know what they're doing with all the CAD and fluid dynamics computations they do,btohqsg
I was surprised too  my forester xt already 7,btohqsg
I no say  u guys assumed hahahaha,btohqsg
Hahaha still can tune even without pap pap pap,btohqsg

Forced induction engines get more margin to play with because they can vary the induction pressure,btohqsg
That opportunity came about when you bought your car,btohqsg
A bit too late to remove stickers now,btohqsg
They seem to just get stuck,btohqsg
People trying to remove those protective films from their Merc screens now,btohqsg

Heat gun.Those vinyl wrap shops use heat gun to remove vinyl wrap,btohqsg

At least this Rocco driver was stopped and advised.,btohqsg
He damn lucky his path was straight,btohqsg
If it was 5 seconds earlier or later,btohqsg
He bang the pedestrian or the taxi uncle alr,btohqsg
hanor. Just thank god no one was hurt,btohqsg
Apparently he had an epileptic episode/heart attack,btohqsg
The Camry saved him from going straight into the wall on the ramp,btohqsg
Who saved the camry driver sia  but honestly lucky camry pax side no passenger,btohqsg
I believe everyone came out safe,btohqsg
Camry driver can't even claim the roc right,btohqsg
I don’t think can if it’s not the Roc’s fault  also maybe since it’s not within his control?,btohqsg
If only we had a button that says “postpone heart attack by 10 minutes”,btohqsg
No... If the report is true that he on drugs/alcohol,btohqsg
Then insurance will void the claim,btohqsg
Camry driver can only claim his own insurance and file civil suit,btohqsg
So if you DUI you’re liable v,btohqsg
If you get into accident while DUI then you're already committing a criminal act,btohqsg
Who proceeds to sue the DUI driver,btohqsg
If you're not at fault do you still lose your NCD?,btohqsg

is the Subaru WRX back in sg..?,btohqsg
geussing its gonna be really ex,btohqsg
Just the levorg wagon probably also break 200k already,btohqsg
so would the sedan be cheaper than the wagon or more ex haha,btohqsg
There is no levorg wagon coming is there?,btohqsg
Frankly matters little to me have or not lol.,btohqsg
Noted with thanks. Mr xipeng doesn't care for Subaru and therefore don't listen to what he says about Subaru,btohqsg
not a true wrx tho if u ask me hahaha even though i like it a lot,btohqsg
Sports wagon... But the CVT is disappointing,btohqsg
Why they can't put in a more sporty transmission is beyond me  other brands all doing it,btohqsg
at least it revs all the way now,btohqsg
performance + CVT is like truffle + fries,btohqsg
still a poor example of the real thing.... just like CVT,btohqsg
Actually Subaru’s car is one of the best already. Idk why it’s different from others,btohqsg
at 257k..... just give it a torque converter or DCT luh....,btohqsg
for what? as if they'll go back and redesign it,btohqsg
unless enough people email them to make a manual levorg,btohqsg
4.7k of us all email them,btohqsg
If this was Pete or mr X,btohqsg
I would've reported that message already,btohqsg
Might want to be careful with assumptions sir,btohqsg
anyway i'm entitled to my opinion against CVT  don't like it,btohqsg
yeah their cvt alr not bad,btohqsg
The lineartronic CVT can feel the gear change one .. I love it 😂😂😂,btohqsg
I think I can survive 180,btohqsg
Tasty but deep down you know it's a scam,btohqsg
Tasty but deep down you know it’s a scam,btohqsg
I don’t feel it’s a scam leh,btohqsg
Erm  upbadging is more like halal pork. Completely fake,btohqsg
Maybe that was from very early cvt you tried (or you owned a cvt before?). Maybe now their cvts are actually good leh otherwise how to compete in that hot space,btohqsg
So truffle fries still better than them,btohqsg
If the whole group order it I'll still eat la. But obviously won't order it for myself,btohqsg
The “I cannot find it in the dark” face?,btohqsg
No it’s the “is it in?” face,btohqsg

Why leh? Not good or u use 97 alr HAHA,btohqsg
M-sport not consider upbadge la. It’s a trim level mah. Just like amg line. Factory labelled,btohqsg
Sometimes dealers also don’t know the difference,btohqsg
Exactly  misleading. Not upbadge per se but still is a low spec car made to look like it is not,btohqsg
But there is actual truffle taste!!!!,btohqsg
Why you keep bullying poor truffle fries,btohqsg
I don't mind truffle fries  but it's just truffle oil,btohqsg
Like special trim  is only body kit,btohqsg
no one even says there is real truffle bits in it lor!,btohqsg
No hor.. some got special stitch and badge in cabin also,btohqsg
Does it change the driving experience?,btohqsg
Like putting stripes on bonnet  roof and body,btohqsg
But it's dumb for those that know the difference,btohqsg
Or black/CF look alike wrap on roof,btohqsg
Is like pumping vpower racing in vios,btohqsg
You drive around see so many owners wrap the roof black to look like CF roof,btohqsg
Or the cerato or fit with fake quad pipes  but the stock exhaust still visible,btohqsg
Maybe it does improve the engine in vios also leh?,btohqsg
To me it’s like how people like to wear pretty clothes. To make them look better even though face or inside body also same,btohqsg
The car makers’ market research departments must have concluded that it helps sell cars.,btohqsg
Like pretty LED light strips in cabins,btohqsg
Or pretty car unlock exterior lighting sequences. Adds to the car experience.,btohqsg
Sometimes a car must drive good must also look good,btohqsg
The car look good can alr,btohqsg
Cus the driver prolly dont need it,btohqsg
Its like Kia Cerato normal line vs GT line. Still sama sama but one look sportier,btohqsg
Not many people can tell the difference between driving good or driving average,btohqsg
Marketing ploy sure  I'll just call it a scam,btohqsg
Carmakers are literally targeting the market that can't tell the difference and won't bother to research,btohqsg

I can never tell between the civic 1.6 and 1.5 turbo LOL,btohqsg
I think it’s the exhaust placement,btohqsg
Wah you dig how long ago one,btohqsg
Plus this civic hard to forget,btohqsg
Living in your head rent free is it,btohqsg
any1 knows why JDM suddenly shot up recently,btohqsg
now all the type r 100k plus,btohqsg
US also jdm cars now going up in prices,btohqsg
see the alley i know alrdy,btohqsg
Yes I had a phase when I don’t really care,btohqsg
now can’t also haha alw so packed,btohqsg
Too early to park in front,btohqsg
Shao rou fan god tier too,btohqsg
There was a golf 7. Constant horns outside the shop,btohqsg
Why never pops and bang instead,btohqsg
No I mean it was parked in front of the shop,btohqsg
Must be the og outlet. The rest taste different,btohqsg
There also got punggol nasi lemak,btohqsg
Punggol nasi lemak sucks balls man,btohqsg
Very bad though  the Kovan and tan John Katong one is nice,btohqsg
brave the yishun danger and come eat chong pang nasi lemak,btohqsg
Hahaha I eat for the chilli,btohqsg
but tbh after 10pm or so yishun is just  dead,btohqsg
all the crazies also go rest,btohqsg
nah man i work there but i see nothing attractive about it so many sandflies,btohqsg
take photo at  oval until dowan take already,btohqsg
what do you guys  think about VRS,btohqsg
it's not overpriced considering it is using MQB platform,btohqsg
Back then 12k depre I didn’t bite the bullet,btohqsg
That’s how I feel about 370z,btohqsg
Should’ve just gotten it when it was 11k depre last year,btohqsg
Hahahaha m3 was 8k a few years ago,btohqsg
Now civic fd also hard to find,btohqsg
if u ask me  vrs is just a even more practical cheaper gti,btohqsg
I told myself 11k depre was out of my budget,btohqsg
I mean in current market vs what it’s worth,btohqsg
But u lose the hot hatch boy racer look,btohqsg
now idt is right time to change car sia haha,btohqsg
in current  market everything also overpriced,btohqsg
abit sleeper if u ask me haha i like the understated look,btohqsg
That’s why if the civic is sold,btohqsg
I wont get a car first,btohqsg
During that time it was 80k ish only,btohqsg
in singapore market everything will forever be overpriced,btohqsg
Stinger 3.3 20k depre worth it,btohqsg
I cry myself to sleep everyday now,btohqsg
the depre worth it but the road tax is not,btohqsg
Ok la  for the performance  it’s hard to get low road tax,btohqsg
Maybe move to aussie open nasi padang shop there,btohqsg
Best other option is the ea888 VAG cars,btohqsg
stinger is twin turbo or js one turbo,btohqsg
yeah cheapest road tax for a twin turbo v6 alr,btohqsg
The $245 678 not sold yet,btohqsg
even cheaper road tax for v6 would be porsche alr sia hahaha,btohqsg
but then again porsche vs kia 😅,btohqsg
I would get the stinger instead,btohqsg
jaguar also got the supercharged 3.0s,btohqsg
I also offered but didn’t get,btohqsg
For me civic is the worse,btohqsg
I think i lowball too much lol,btohqsg
this is a damn cool car,btohqsg
u offered for the stinger ah,btohqsg
Most practical out there. More so than wagons to me,btohqsg
What yall think of the new gtr,btohqsg
yeah u won’t be able to find a wagon with that kinda performance for that kind of price tag,btohqsg
Stinger I got enquire before  but it was gone the same day it was listed,btohqsg
Is it r36 or new and improved(ish) r35 ah,btohqsg
waste ppl time sia if legit r36,btohqsg
the jag 2.0 diesel also not bad right,btohqsg
I find the rear diffuser a bit weird  and the exhaust position,btohqsg
if i bought a jag i won’t get a diesel ah haha,btohqsg
Got golf diesel in the market right now,btohqsg
the diffuser like abit empty sia haha,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHA this is a cool car,btohqsg
but i won’t trust vw diesels man,btohqsg
mk6 a lot have been toyed with also,btohqsg
which can be a good thing bad thing,btohqsg
ppl i know that drove it say really very fun,btohqsg
I think there’s 2 in the market now,btohqsg
i freaking love the VAG 3.6 vr6,btohqsg
but a lot been toyed with,btohqsg
the r36 passat even cooler if u ask me,btohqsg
