Hi   Would like to have suggestions for after market blind spot monitoring system for Toyota Vios . Thanks,btohqsg
how does it work? the beep beep sound one ah?,btohqsg
Alot of modern cars have this function,btohqsg
Vim AutoAlex 8157 3455He got do blind spot mirror thingy,btohqsg
That's lane keep assist and lane departure warning,btohqsg
Different sensors at work for those,btohqsg
ok la....anything to improve on road safety right?,btohqsg
For manufacturer ones  there's usually an ultrasonic sensor in your C pillar that checks for cars in the Blindspot area like a higher parking sensor,btohqsg
And then you get a light on the mirror glass or inner side of the mirror housing for VAG cars,btohqsg
And you can have a beep warning on in case you start turning towards the car in the Blindspot,btohqsg
i rather get something to improve on my parking,btohqsg
