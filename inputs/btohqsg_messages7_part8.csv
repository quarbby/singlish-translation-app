Can't see the stack no. Which stack u referring? Maybe can check again.,btohqsg
I based on the windows pointing to which direction to determine the sun. As long as the windows is facing either north or south. No direct hot sun.,btohqsg
Ohhh okay then think its fine. Wont wan the hot sun shining through my room .,btohqsg
Your compass direction a bit off,btohqsg
West sun is ? The hot scorching one ?,btohqsg
South supposed to be directly below  not at 8 o clock direction,btohqsg

38 and 40 facing south-west  will have west sun about half of the year (sept to march). But depends on which floor  possible that stack 20 can provide some shade for 40,btohqsg
Was thinking about that too . Was planning to get stack 38. Will change to stack 40 then.,btohqsg
So excited about my selection unit appt tmr omg,btohqsg
Not too high and not too low,btohqsg
For 40 one bedroom wall may be hot due to west sun,btohqsg
What is the max storey for Stack 20?,btohqsg
Based on the map  not much unit is directly facing north or south.,btohqsg
It's alr partly built right? Maybe you can go to the site to get a better idea,btohqsg
I believe all is level 13 .,btohqsg
Yes finishing this year. Still not open to walk inside yet tho,btohqsg
Should be able to block the sun.,btohqsg
Hopefully ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è that block left with those 2 stacks only,btohqsg
