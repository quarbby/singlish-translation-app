So when they apply  they declare got house or no house?,btohqsg
I don't know but they managed to pick an unit,btohqsg
some even wanted to look for MP if they get rejected by HDB,btohqsg
My bro did that. Got a rejection email after that,btohqsg
He went for SBF tho. Not sure if the rules apply,btohqsg
Np. I was under the inpression that we can do that as well. Since still under construction,btohqsg
But i think they wanna make it fair for people who really need one.,btohqsg
means those I have known who managed to snap an unit were lucky,btohqsg
Maybe their new internal policy. To calibrate for the increased demand,btohqsg
Hmm.. nvm. I just inform my friend to just try his luck. Worse come to worse find MP only,btohqsg
That is what most Singaporean will do,btohqsg
Later they will say  that‚Äôs the reason I voted for u!,btohqsg
later the MP asks  have you approached HDB? or vice versa,btohqsg
Of cos must go through HDB first ma  reject that‚Äôs why come find you,btohqsg
Like that once u got your BTO key  u can start applying again. As based on present pandemic  most will take more than 5 yrs. So just nice reach MOP. Lol,btohqsg
Take keys plus fulfil the MOP means 10 years liao,btohqsg
By right lah. 5 yrs MOP and 5 yrs waiting games for flat been built,btohqsg
I don't think HDB will allow you from applying if MOP not mature yet bah.,btohqsg
Hi all inside this group waiting for BTO house at tampines to be built?,btohqsg
Hello morning Anyone has the link to kebun beru edge project telegram group?,btohqsg

Recently (few months back) I wrote to HDB asking precisely this thing and they replied say definitely must wait till current flat MOP finish then can apply BTO. Regardless when that BTO expect to TOP.,btohqsg
If using HDB portal to apply  cant even click to apply ba...,btohqsg
Means they gotten a unit despite MOP not met,btohqsg
Amazing right  how on one hand 'officially' say cannot be done but in practice is otherwise.,btohqsg
Perhaps the applicant had some extenuating circumstances that allowed the application to go thru  who knew.,btohqsg
106 HDB resale flats sold for over S$1m in first half of 2021  over 4 times total in same period of 2020: SRX dataProperty analysts said that the demand for million-dollar flats was driven by well-to-do buyers who want better connectivity and more space to work from home. Such flats were also more affordable than private property.üèòhttps://tdy.sg/3hoR8D9@todayonlinesg,btohqsg
i forget to tell don here a big thank you for sending me the link group chat for woodgrove ascentüòÉ,btohqsg

Hello!Does anyone know for this case:Partner 1 is full-time employed for >12 months with gross monthly income$X.Partner 2 recently gained full-time employment (~1 month at the time of flat selection) with gross monthly income$Y.Will EHG calculation be$X+$Yeven though partner 2 is only recently employed? I asking because usually HLE don't take into account the current month income  so I wonder if EHG will consider.,btohqsg
think they would get the average,btohqsg
HLE is based on 3 months consecutive employment while EHG needs 12 months continously employment,btohqsg
as long as below combined of $9k salary,btohqsg
Ehg should be based on income prior to flat application and not selection.,btohqsg
Ohhh nice üëç I wait for HDB confirm with me this info üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi   do we need to renew our hle every 6 months till we get the house key ?,btohqsg
No. Just ensure you have a valid hle at the point of key collection if u are going for hdb loan. You don't need to keep 'refreshing' it.,btohqsg
Do I jus need to renew b4 key collection,btohqsg
if the HLE is able to last till your collection date  no need to renew,btohqsg
Pls update once HDB have confirm on this,btohqsg
Are those transacted prices in HDB records with or without COV?,btohqsg
With cov. And the split to show u the extend of cov being paid... How much lesser than 20k  and how much being 20k and above...,btohqsg
Coz i been tracking some of the resales  for a year... it appears most have risen 60-80k,btohqsg
So if u look at the north east pie chart  of those who paid for  66%  paid 20k and less,btohqsg
So if those pricing not including COV it's really scary.,btohqsg
To be honest  these pie charts don't really show much. It will be more informative if there is data to show what percentage of transacted deals were with or without cov,btohqsg
North east is 66% paid 20k and _below_,btohqsg
if 66% paid 20k and above cooling measures very soon liao,btohqsg
You're right. Typo on my part.,btohqsg
It's easy to predict when CM comes out. For the last few times  its always the same pattern. More and more news pointing to over heating appear over the days.,btohqsg
Then boomz  usually Fri late afternoon the CM will announce.,btohqsg
Well it does show that people are more willing to pay higher cov for prime areas  I.e. more centralised locations,btohqsg
Glad to see HDB resale prices going up,btohqsg
'Wealth' is correspondingly up too for many I guess.,btohqsg
Sure every one of us have someone close to us who 'enjoy' this benefit.,btohqsg
I wont say surprising  coz IMO is a very liveable area,btohqsg
Count the number of shopping malls vs say the North,btohqsg
For me  I feel the east has more factors for the buyers to pay cov for... Tho it's not relevant now  the airport.,btohqsg
Now with WFH and suburbanisation  (Uniqlo can be found almost every corner for instance) every place is SG is equally livable. Plus with Grab and Panda,btohqsg
It seems that EHG calculation is done after booking of flat  not during balloting exercise.,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing  very very useful.,btohqsg
Yup but the assessment period is based on application month and not selection month,btohqsg
they did say assessment period of May 2020 to Apr 2021  in this case for the May 2021 BTO exercise.,btohqsg
Resale HDBDue to the increase in demand for resale HDBs  every 1 in 3 buyers has paid a Cash Over Valuation (COV) in 2021 as compared to 1 in 5 buyers in 2020. As COV data is not usually published  here we have a list of HDB COV amounts and their respective transactions to give potential buyers a more accurate sensing of the market.https://stackedhomes.com/editorial/hdb-cov-database-2021-a-crowdsourced-compilation/#gs.5rkmz7,btohqsg
May I know when key collections  do we need to bring CPF statement again?,btohqsg
Collection of keysWhen you come to collect the keys to your flat  you must bring the original copy of these documents  of all persons listed in the application:Identity cardsCertificate of insuranceYou must buy fire insurance from HDB's appointed insurer  FWD Singapore Pte Ltd (FWD)  if you are taking an HDB housing loan.

Otherwise  you can inform us of the CPF account number on the appointment datePower of Attorney if you are unable to attend the appointment personally (if you are overseas  the attorney representing you must bring one certified true copy by the solicitors and two photocopies)Completed GIRO form if you are paying monthly loan instalments partially or fully by cash,btohqsg
May I know if I apply for bto using mcps scheme  does the main applicant mailing address used for the application need to be within 4km from the project launch if say the co applicant current address is within the 4km radius,btohqsg
the mailing address doesn't matter  only the parents' registered address and BTO project location,btohqsg
mailing address is just for HDB to send you a physical letter confirming your participation in BTO exercise and the number of chances you have for this exercise,btohqsg
even the ballot result/queue number is sent via email to main applicant,btohqsg
Either applicant's parents will be ok,btohqsg
Anyone mind sharing what are the other fees and how much these fees when signing agreement and collection of key?,btohqsg
I saw this but there is no costs.,btohqsg
"You see at the bottom of the ""Buying a flat from HDB"" table... got a link to a 'payment plan calculator'... can try and use and plug in your values and will tell you the costs... üôÇ",btohqsg
Then click breakdown and that's all for these fees costs?,btohqsg
I anyhow put value ah can see something like this,btohqsg
If you asking to be spoonfed to this level  I don't think you are ready to be a homeowner.,btohqsg

U rent a hse also much more than that mah.,btohqsg
hmm but her current house already no more loan,btohqsg
as a comparison in terms of cost  she does not have to pay anymore for her current flat,btohqsg
but OK  it's a double edge sword,btohqsg
What to do? Either u stay on till u die or move and pay and stay till u die.,btohqsg
sell 4r house get 2r CPF got $$$$$$,btohqsg
At least free up cash  better quality retirement?,btohqsg
so overall  it's a good idea,btohqsg
I also want to downsize to 2r within the next 20 or 30 years,btohqsg
but must ballot for 2nd BTO at a prime location before the downsizing,btohqsg
isnt it 'bao chiak' when sell,btohqsg

yah my mum even pawned her dowries to get me the PC,btohqsg
I'm targeting 1.5mil by age 50,btohqsg
I was in guilt  paid her back one lump sum of $10k on what she had spent on me during the 10 years of my childhood  aga aga,btohqsg
add up all the monthly allowances long exceed what parents spend on us liao la,btohqsg
I never gave her any as she has rental to collect monthly,btohqsg
But $10K then is not same as $10K now,btohqsg
$10K then is like $200K now,btohqsg
I gave her the $10k only after 17 years,btohqsg
Yea the sacrifices that parents made for the kids,btohqsg
cannot compare oso.... SG growth phase is over,btohqsg
no I didn't give my mum monthly allowance,btohqsg
easily $50K HDB sell after 30-40yrs become $500K,btohqsg
but I'm paying for the utilities and such  like maintenance  aircon spoil also spent $4k buying it,btohqsg
Aircon spoilt but i'm unwilling to spend,btohqsg

for people don't cook like me  no choice,btohqsg
I try to cook more at home. I need a full-fledged kitchen for my bto.,btohqsg
Once in a while OK la  anyway you're slim  no issue,btohqsg
High calories with high sodium. Just like potato chips.,btohqsg
When turned into chips  cassava has an effortless crisp and flavor that doesn't require excessive amounts of oil  making it a healthier choice when looking to satisfy your craving for chips. ... Cassava is a rich source of carbohydrates  vitamin C  thiamine  riboflavin  and niacin.,btohqsg
The bottom line. Tapioca is high in carbs and calories  so it is not a traditionally healthful food. However  it can help a person meet the recommended daily allowance of several important nutrients. It can also be a tasty  nutritious food choice for people who need to gain weight.,btohqsg
If u don't cook and ur wife doesn't cook  all meals outside ah?,btohqsg
Now food is getting more expensive. Esp the drinks...,btohqsg
I think I need bring my own vacuum flask dabao drinks from home.,btohqsg
Hi  want to ask is this true?,btohqsg
HLE is needed only during booking a flat and collecting keys,btohqsg
Oh. Hmmm.. so if when collecting keys it‚Äôs expired still need to apply with fresh docs?,btohqsg
I see  seems there‚Äôs no need as well!,btohqsg
Hi sorry . Any has the link to the group for Yio chu kang beacon bto project,btohqsg

I rather u stay as a president than an investor.,btohqsg
Anyone owns a hdb with your parent and planning to move out and get a resale? I‚Äôm in this situation so wanting to understand better,btohqsg
I am a co-owner of my mum's,btohqsg
but we are waiting for our respective new houses,btohqsg
after the house is sold the accrued interest plus the principle amount will be returned back to your CPFOA,btohqsg
not sure about if you want to coown the resale with your parents again,btohqsg
Yeap I got to as I‚Äôm 31 only,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just mum and me tho,btohqsg
if not  you're still a first timer should you ballot for a BTO,btohqsg
I‚Äôve never as I‚Äôve only done a transfer of ownership,btohqsg
Bto very unlikely as my mum has taken cpf grants before,btohqsg
but I still can bto with my wife as a first timer,btohqsg
still can bto the 2nd time as a 2nd timer,btohqsg
I refer to your email on your enquiry on the cash proceeds upon selling your flat.The estimated cash proceeds are calculated in this matter:Declared selling price$XXXLessOutstanding loan¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†$0CPF refunds to yourself$XXXCPF refunds to Mr xxxxx$XXXDeposit (if any)$XXXResale levy (if any)$XXXOther deductions (if any)$XXXTotal deductions$XXXCash proceeds will be the selling price minus the total deductions.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not married so even if I wanna get  it‚Äôs gotta be with my mum as I‚Äôm 31 only lol,btohqsg
I know of someone who enjoyed BTO and re$$$$$$$sold many times jointly with parents.,btohqsg
And eventually got mature estate 2rm using parents name but is the one staying there.,btohqsg
All the while either staying with sibling's or rented out whole flat,btohqsg
Now that's call milked it to the max.,btohqsg
Hey all! can i ask if BTO windows can be changed? i only know about the flooring and toilet. can‚Äôt seems to find any article regarding the window. because i want to install soundproof window if i were to stay at low floor unit near the main road. );,btohqsg
and also   if i have more than 60k OA. should i max out my loan and don‚Äôt use my OA to let it roll the interest which is 3.5%?  or? any ways to cut down the interest? cause i‚Äôm confused with the cpf interest ):,btohqsg
Depends on your project. Certain projects have requirements for you not to change anything that will alter the facade. You will be informed of what you can't change when u collect keys.,btohqsg
if you can't get higher interest rate elsewhere  then yeah use cash for your housing loan so that your OA fund can generate 1-1.5% higher interest,btohqsg
I find that such method is for people who can still save up after the deduction for loan,btohqsg
ahh isee! i‚Äôm looking at melody spring yishun. so to say  not all BTO projects window can‚Äôt be change right? (:,btohqsg
Hi xw! if it‚Äôs you what would you do?if the unit cost 400k . you have 331k (20years) 468k (30years) HLE approved loan and 80k OA in total? (:,btohqsg
I think they are more particular about the frame and how it will alter the overall look of the building from the outside. Your id and contractors will know more about whether it can be changed or not.And yes  HDB officers will go thru this point with u if your unit is in such a project where windows can't be change. Or if u wanna build a new window at your service yard  what colour it should be.,btohqsg
ahh isee! cause i consulted the window company but they told me first 5years cannot change to sound proof windows. so i‚Äôm shocked how people staying near expressway tahan the noise. but i only left with low floors. bad luck bad queue number what to do ):,btohqsg
downside using cash to pay is you'd be lacking of lesser cash unless you can save quite a substantial amount,btohqsg
you have to see the amount of your monthly expenses,btohqsg
example if you are left with $2k cash savings even after the loan deduction that's very very good already,btohqsg
can rent out a bedroom and cover your housing loan  but on the expense of your privacy,btohqsg
why not opting for bank loan?,btohqsg
is it you took bank loan? which bank? (:,btohqsg
limited then better stick to CPF mode,btohqsg
another alternative is rent out bedroom,btohqsg
isee! thankyou xw and leong for the help!! üôáüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
If the flat application is under family nuclear or Singaporean + SPR;how‚Äôs the enhanced CPF grant calculate ? Full or half ?,btohqsg
what's full half? thought can get the grant as long as below $9k combined?,btohqsg
plus a year of consecutive working,btohqsg
confused for this table  thought if family nuclear of SC+SPR will only get half of the grant based since the grant will only disburse to SC CPF acc,btohqsg
so in this case  if let‚Äôs say the grant is 80k  then will be fully disburse to SC CPF acc ? üòÖ,btohqsg
but why half of the grant amount?,btohqsg
just because one of them is SPR?,btohqsg
The EHG amount is based on the average gross monthly household income assessed over for the months worked¬†during the assessment period  i.e.¬†a 12-month period prior^ to the date of your flat application (see example 2 below).¬† The incomes of all working persons in the household (i.e. applicants and occupiers) are included in the assessment.¬† Families with lower household incomes will receive a larger grant amount.,btohqsg
wondering anyone with similar experience here and still can get the full grant for family nuclear of SC+SPR,btohqsg
Next time also can get extra 10k,btohqsg
extra $10k on the exchange of giving up one's citizenship,btohqsg
Oh eh sorry this one not extra,btohqsg
You need pay 10k extra when buying flat üòÖ,btohqsg
in this case if let‚Äôs say the household income is less than $1500  then the grant to be receive will be $80k and will disburse to the sole SC CPF acc ? nice nice,btohqsg
CPF OA will be wiped after giving you the grant to offset housing purchase price and downpayment  with option to keep up to 20k in your CPF.,btohqsg
thansk man  this is the answer for family nuclear of SC+SPR,btohqsg
np  did what I could while browsing phone eating brunch ü§£,btohqsg
hey guys! what's your opinions about the balance flats at Yishun,btohqsg
or should wait for queenstown bto august,btohqsg
no harm applying  not say want then can get also haha,btohqsg
apply already sia then tmr go choose flat haha,btohqsg
This one will be hotly contested. Will be fiercer than the recent telok blangah beacon bto.,btohqsg
Just take ba. Since u got appointment..,btohqsg
A bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush.,btohqsg
Another thing to consider is how long do you have to wait... Is the flat in yishun is available more quickly than if you were to go for a fresh bto lottery?,btohqsg
Queenstown has more units and is far from mrt,btohqsg
We see lor. I think it will,btohqsg
U referring to application rate or number of applicants?,btohqsg
Either way  it's bad news for buyers.,btohqsg
Ok lah August has other good locations like tamp and kovan,btohqsg
Oh I didn't see other projects in the same launch..,btohqsg
Applications then maybe possible  since queenstown has 610 units but telok blangah only 170,btohqsg
It should be the hottest one in the next launch ba. That's why for the bro above who has an appointment for yishun sales of balance  I not sure why he's considering risking his selection for the next bto,btohqsg
If can select flat  just go for that le.,btohqsg
Any idea if elderly singles will also have to pay additional 15k for 2 room flats?,btohqsg
Anyone acquired tengah bto during May 2019? Anyone know if it will delay for a year due to covid?,btohqsg
Short lease pay 15k like not worth sia. For non mature estate that's more than 10% of flat price,btohqsg
that's like my mum would be paying $333/mth for 30 years,btohqsg
My relative selecting flat this fri  she just realised need to pay 15k more,btohqsg
The flat only 166k for 99 year lease  so 15k is a lot,btohqsg
I thought maybe short lease won't need to pay 15k,btohqsg
regardless shortlease  singles have to pay $15k for 2r flexi,btohqsg
see does this applies to your relative,btohqsg
anyway  grant amount will be shared between both sole applicants,btohqsg
Ok thanks  I think she first timer,btohqsg
she never bought new subsidised flat from HDB before?,btohqsg
Grant given only to a maximum of 2 applicants who are husband and wife  and who are also the current owners of the 2-room subsidised flat,btohqsg
Nvr  so only can get EHG,btohqsg
Anybody have an idea how to change the scheme/ personal info in the SBF application status?,btohqsg
I'm 99% sure (from memory) you login  go to MyHDB > Applications > New Flat  then click on your application number and scroll to the bottom have option to make changes to your application.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  just a quick question: Do I need to amend Family nucleus in my HDB portal because I've just delivered a baby?,btohqsg
then if no need  what's the status of the baby in the household?,btohqsg
I feel like if baby is occupant just update anyway,btohqsg
To be very honest  I don't remember hahahahahahaha. I wasn't pregnant when I applied for my sbf  but I already had 2 kids then.,btohqsg
Okay I went to re-read everything on the PPS. Yes I think I'm under that scheme because I have kids. So I'm gonna just include my #3's name as occupant just in case,btohqsg
no harm doing that just need some of your time,btohqsg
You're right! Imma do it tonight. Thank you all for your inputs!,btohqsg
If i alr have a house  can i still bto and stay in my current house while waiting for bto to be completed ?,btohqsg
You will be applying as 2nd timerIf you are the owner of a HDB and have yet to complete MOP  must either appeal or wait for 5yr MOP to be up before applying.If you own private property  must dispose and wait 30 months before applying.If you own HDB that's already MOP  can just apply as second timer.,btohqsg
Didn't know can purchase resale without grant  those passed down units I understand.,btohqsg
if@wwwww1261never received any grant or subsidy then he's still a first timer,btohqsg
I will be applying as a second timer BUT i want to apply for a new bto and not sell my current flat before i get my new bto . Isit possible ?,btohqsg
Im willing to sell maybe a few months before my new bto come,btohqsg
Just want to know if i need to sell the current flat before i can apply for a new bto,btohqsg
Your current flat reach MOP alr right?,btohqsg
Not yet but lets say if reach already then sell,btohqsg
why not as long as your CPFOA has sufficient fund for the downpayment of your BTO,btohqsg
After reach then can apply. Don't need to sell yet,btohqsg
ideal time to sell is when you get your keys,btohqsg
Sell within 6 months after BTO key collection,btohqsg
But to apply when you still within MOP then must write in to appeal,btohqsg
what's your budget for the next housing?,btohqsg
when you get the keys you must have sufficient fund for the remaining payment for your new house,btohqsg
the time lapse of letter for key collection varies I think,btohqsg
some one week in advance  some few months,btohqsg
Idk the budget yet . Because my current house is still as single   i want to get married and upgrade my house . So will be 2 income together,btohqsg
As long as i have enough for downpayment ok alr right ? ü§î,btohqsg
Okay great thank you guys üòçüòçüòçüòç,btohqsg
2nd part is getting keys because you probably haven't sold your house yet  if you managed to save so much then no issue,btohqsg
or doing a contra with HDB,btohqsg
Hmm i will still be eligible for a loan right ? ü§î,btohqsg
that's if the loan is enough to cover,btohqsg
4r  example $500k  then you must have $50k fund either CPFOA or cash for downpayment  then another 4 or 5 years to save up,btohqsg
Just have to pay levy üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
But the levy is paid to government himself or will the levy be paid into our new house ?,btohqsg
then say if your loan quantum is $350k  then you must cough up at least $100k during key collection  oh and levy $40k  in cash too,btohqsg
pay HDB in cash I think,btohqsg
and there's a cap of how much proceeds you can use from the sale of your resale,btohqsg
Loan quantum for the new flat or my current one ?,btohqsg
you not eligible for loan with HDB 2nd time right,btohqsg
Levy how they count ah ? Half of what i earned or ?,btohqsg
HDB loan can only apply once?,btohqsg
that's why you have to find out more on the contra,btohqsg
how old is your resale flat,btohqsg
My current flat is bto flat not resale,btohqsg
then $40k for 4r if you're applying for 4r,btohqsg
just remember you can't use the sale proceeds of your resale fully for your next purchase,btohqsg
50% of sales proceed I think,btohqsg
As I currently hold on to a flat,btohqsg
Then the rest of the 50% is see whether can loan till the amount or not ?,btohqsg
Now currently interest rate from HDN is 3.16%,btohqsg
Cause my wife borrowed HDB Loan before,btohqsg
Till i sell the current house then revert back to 2.6%,btohqsg
50% cash proceeds is pay to our new flat right,btohqsg
So levy and 50% cash proceeds is different,btohqsg
Yup levy and cash proceed doff,btohqsg
So lets say i earn 100k from selling my current flat   i have to pay 30k levy + put 50% cash proceed to my new flat?,btohqsg
I did not take grants from current house,btohqsg
Minus off the outstanding and all other fees and that consider cash proceeds,btohqsg
I think for your current hse -> new BTO  if you lucky can arrange to sell within the key collection period as you have 3 months time to move out.So sell house before BTO key -> money into cpf -> pay BTO collect key -> take some time to move.But danger is if BTO side delay very troublesome. Also can look for sellers willing to wait longer until you ready to move out as well üôÇBottom line is plan properly and DYODD!,btohqsg
please factor in the reno for the new house too,btohqsg
For me as long no need to lose too much as mine is 7 years later,btohqsg
By then current house sure drop in values,btohqsg
what's the best time to sell the flat,btohqsg
still need to ask for extension of stay from the new owners,btohqsg
otherwise  how to gao dim your accomodation after selling the flat,btohqsg
Will look into this in 2027 and discuss with agent,btohqsg
like that ah then would you consider selling your house now and rent a room to stay for 7 years? rental*84 months,btohqsg
Current house only use CPF to pay,btohqsg
then LL to earn lesser from the sale,btohqsg
As my parents room still need to tidy up,btohqsg
but unclean air maybe not now due to covid but after that.....,btohqsg
I heard it can get overwhelming. But it is from time to time.,btohqsg
soli ah means you get a temp loan from HDB at 3.16% interest till the resale house is sold right? means upon key collection you can have two houses at the same time but on the expense of 0.56% extra interest paid to HDB,btohqsg
Yup so best sold the house before key collection 3 months before that the idea,btohqsg
I don't know since I am staying quite far from pasir gudang though I have witnessed the burning of chimney at my service yard 13 years ago,btohqsg
that's if the new owners do not mind letting you stay for 3 months,btohqsg
and how would you anticipate the key collection date???,btohqsg
say you change your key collections to a month later from the given date and you engage an agent to help you sell but they take an average of 2 months to deal ....hmmm,btohqsg
plus reno takes 2 months average,btohqsg
I can rent house for a few months ba üò¨  thank you !! I will save it all üòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
Slowly plan now over 5 years make sure no holes in your plan  a lot of time to do so üëç,btohqsg
So if u sell the house before key collection will be back to the same loan interest at 2.6%?,btohqsg
that was what he meant bah,btohqsg
Just wear good filter mask lol,btohqsg
Haha I think an air filter should get the job done. Anyways  as long as the homeowner likes the place  they will do anything to make living there possible,btohqsg
yes correct. and also the resale flat must not be under HDB loan  only bank loan. I fall under this category too and I‚Äôm currently applying for BTO under first-timer,btohqsg
did you manage to get balloted?,btohqsg
yeah  I didn‚Äôt take any grants too,btohqsg
cancelled my Tengah unit during selection,btohqsg

Did u apply for it in the first place.,btohqsg
Can try see your principle amount and accrued interest aftee login into your HDB,btohqsg
loan granted should be excluding grant?,btohqsg
thks  called both Cpf and Hdb. HDB is the right party to advise us.,btohqsg
the CPF cannot advise on CPF housing grant  have to call HDB.HDB will tell you if you are eligible for this grant.One of the criteria is you have to be 1st timer. This was what i was being told when i called.,btohqsg
Hi  Senja heights have a group chat. Pls look up Facebook Senja heights and request for your number to include in   group chat,btohqsg

I received another email today informing me of 6 months delay in my project @ Woodlands Glade.,btohqsg
serious ar?!...i was hoping in moving out this year..6 months till when,btohqsg
U mean   there was a delay n now delay again?,btohqsg
Nonono they just sent another email  only delayed 6 months,btohqsg
Previous email they stated also PCD Q2  yesterday's email also Q2... I hope it stays that way haha,btohqsg
"Just a little gossip here.My BTO is Fernvale Glades.Initial TOP is 1st Q of 2021. Then rec'd email 1st Q 2022.When I visited the site...I could see them rushing the DOP n carpark was ready on the side where the blocks are  completed.I was really happy.  But disappointment  follows.Then heard some ""insider"" news.Saying HDB intend to hang over the keys 1st Q 2022. üò≠üò≠üò≠So HDB won't give keys even is ready?",btohqsg
Actually does PCD = TOP in the first place?,btohqsg
delivery possession date is when hdb has to hand over the keys,btohqsg
So  meaning they have been pushing PCD date later because of covid  but DPD date is like kinda fixed as per contract  meaning we now have lesser time than before to inspect the flats before lease officially start  yes? üòÖ,btohqsg
the lease starts once you have collected yourbkeys,btohqsg
Oh. I always thought the lease start as per delivery possession date. Hahaha. Okay,btohqsg
But from teoalida site  For HDB blocks  the 99-year lease starts usually after up to 1 year from when construction is finished,btohqsg
Thats why i always thought that the DPD is the contract start date. Cos PCD is always 1 year earlier.,btohqsg
But some user replied  MOP starts when u take the keys to it..Doesnt mean if lease started earlier then your MOP will end earlier even though you took the keys to it later..,btohqsg
According to CPF   Lease Commencement Date is the start date of the lease of your property. Purchase Date. HDB flats - refers to the date of application received by HDB to buy a flat. You can login with your SingPass at HDB Website to obtain this date.,btohqsg
Personally  I think the HDB staff said my lease commence from the DPD,btohqsg
Probable Completion Date (PCD)(Estimated date of completion of construction of the flat)1st¬†Quarter 2022Delivery Possession Date (DPD)(Date HDB is required under the Agreement of Lease to deliver possession of flat)30 April 2022,btohqsg
So yeah I think starts from DPD,btohqsg
However  the loan starts after keys were collected,btohqsg
Guess I have mixed these up,btohqsg
This is from which BTO project. Look like can't deliver on time.,btohqsg
Oic. So how is the progress? Possible to deliver on time?,btohqsg
Delayed twice  2 quarters =6 months,btohqsg
Yes possible to deliver on time,btohqsg
Because during the norm  we are used to hearing couples collecting keys way before PCD.,btohqsg
Jan 2022 earliest to take keys based on the PCD,btohqsg
Now covid  we can either hope to collect key as near as PCD  or not too far beyond from PCD.,btohqsg
Earliest date you can get keys,btohqsg
So if the letter state 1st Q 2022...got chance to collect earlier?. Really praying hard. üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Haha hard since the construction industry is lacking of manpower,btohqsg
Instead of $20 now up to $50,btohqsg
Mine was delayed from 1q until 4q,btohqsg
Hmmm... my sil bto at Tampines Greenflora  she received the same email of 6 months delay when her estate all painted already. In the end she collected her keys after a 3 months delay. Supposedly November collect but she got it at February.,btohqsg
My delay is 12 months. Guess  just to wait.,btohqsg
Same goes to rivervale shores bto,btohqsg
In total count 5.5 years :(,btohqsg
2017 august.From 2022 Q2 to  2023 Q1/Q2,btohqsg
We are future neighbours. Yes the blocks are all done and website stated its 97% but the remaining 3% seems like its taking ages. I am getting so impatient too üò©,btohqsg
Just hit 98%ü•≥But it feels like an eternityüò´,btohqsg
I know right. Affecting so many of our plans i am sure. Pray it will be settled by October at least man.,btohqsg
don't rely so much on the figure,btohqsg
If you check BCA website 460A and B already received TOP,btohqsg
Where can I find that data?,btohqsg
In the above link xw sent. Under June 2021,btohqsg
The percentages on btohq arent reliable  ive seen projects jump from 98% bk to like 90% before. And some at 13% though nothing has begun at the construction site. So dont think abt the completion  occupy urself w other things  haha,btohqsg
Of rec'd TOP doesn't mean HDB will release keys  right?Will just wait for durian to drop.,btohqsg
Mine from 99 down to 83/85%,btohqsg
Yea coz it's just interpolated based on launch and estimated top date,btohqsg

Hi can i ask if anyone knows if i opt for hdb loan and pay by cpf. Does it means there will be cpf incrued interest 2.6% + hdb loan 2.6%?,btohqsg
2.6 +2.6 = 5.2%  thats a lot.,btohqsg
Accrued interest is 2.5 not 2.6% right,btohqsg
Bank loan will also have accrued interest,btohqsg

hi  does anyone know what is the one in red  is that window? thanks.,btohqsg
Anyone know if there is any upcoming BTO in punggol??,btohqsg
no one knows but there are still many plots of land,btohqsg
thanks. do you happen to know  why is the gable end  just takes up a fraction of the wall but not the whole wall? I tried to google but can't find anything,btohqsg
Gable end wallsFound in corner HDB units  these are walls with short awnings on the exterior to protect your home from sun and heat. It's like sunglasses but for the walls.,btohqsg
Usually after book flat can source for ID alr ? Because the HDB people did say some applications MIGHT not be approved or something.,btohqsg
What if i alr paid ID deposit then for some reason cannot buy flat? üòÇ my eligibility is ok but i just scared in case,btohqsg
Maybe pay your hdb downpayment before ID deposit haha,btohqsg
This year end . My flat will be completed on sept .,btohqsg
are the SBF flats already TOP or it‚Äôs one of those that are under construction?,btohqsg
Scared ID cant hold the price quoted now for that long,btohqsg
I see. you should probably wait till flat TOP and then you can start to search for ID,btohqsg
Under construction but the max dpd date is nov,btohqsg
as long as you have yet to pay anything then that‚Äôs fine. you still have plenty of time to look around,btohqsg
Maybe i go meet the id see how long he can hold the price for üòÇ nego nego abit,btohqsg
yeah  that‚Äôs a good idea but how does he price it? does he say something likeif you don‚Äôt take the package from me now  then the prices might be more expensive if you decide to take the same one a few months laterkind of thing?,btohqsg
Havent met him yet. But believe mostly all ids would say that,btohqsg
I placed deposit with my ID in March as I thought I can collect keys in June,btohqsg
he assured me the price is locked in,btohqsg
If not casetrusted/ hdb registered does it mean not safe to go for the id?,btohqsg
Better don't sign up with such firm,btohqsg
LOL Im infront of the shop alr,btohqsg
Or at least Google for their firms to read the reviews,btohqsg
Not reliable too those negative ones can be written by their rivals too,btohqsg

Is it advisable to save the resale grant for next bto purchase?,btohqsg
Or should i just take hdb loan with resale grant and then convert to bank loan and topping up cpf with cash to avoid the cpf accrued interest rate.,btohqsg
