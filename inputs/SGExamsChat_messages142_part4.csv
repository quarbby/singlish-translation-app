"I am curious as to why many Singaporeans seem to now use 'math' (the American spelling) over 'maths' (the British spelling)? However  about 15 years ago  Singaporeans seem to use 'maths' over 'math'. Why the change?It also seems that 'soccer' (American English) is used far more often than 'football' (British English).However  'lift' (British English) seems to still be used more often than 'elevator' (American English).I thought Singapore  as a former British colony  would use British English as the standard.I also understand that Singaporeans generally are taught the American way of punctuating sentences. I asked someone if he would write ""Hello."" (American) or 'Hello'. (British). Note the position of the full stop. He said he uses the former.",btohqsg
â€˜Mathâ€™ is easier to pronounce than â€˜Mathsâ€™ I suppose,btohqsg
I still say the latter though,btohqsg
Hahaha. I suppose you're not British as well.It might be because 'math' is one letter shorter than 'maths'. It's also interesting because many Singaporeans seem to not be able to pronounce the 'th' sound  instead pronouncing as if the 'h' is silent.,btohqsg
One other interesting aspect in Singapore schools is that some teachers seem to dislike cursive writing. Cursive script used to be taught in Singapore schools decades ago so it's not completely alien. I find it very difficult to write without joining the letters.,btohqsg
Who say we call it math,btohqsg
anyone know where to study do grpwork at scape?,btohqsg
'Math' instead of 'maths' is what many Singaporeans write these days. I am not asking about how exactly people pronounce it.,btohqsg
