Not fun  you forget about it around the 5-7 hour but once you sit or lie down it'll feel very sore,btohqsg
used to do flyer distribution with billboard,btohqsg

MOE denies blocking transgender student from receiving hormone therapy  Singapore News & Top Stories - The Straits Timeshttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/moe-denies-blocking-transgender-student-from-receiving-hormone-therapy,btohqsg

First day or two is absolutely brutal. Your legs are gonna feel like somebody surgically inserted knives in the muscles,btohqsg
If you‚Äôre working in a cold warehouse the low temperature becomes the main concern,btohqsg
hi guys  anyone here from JPJC badminton? I was wondering what's the CCA schedule like.,btohqsg
All cca from jp wed and fri timing depend on when people finish,btohqsg
so only have CCAs on Wednesday and Friday,btohqsg
only have ccas on wednesday and friday normally i think?,btohqsg
got a lot of pw and mt anyway,btohqsg
cause the most shiok thing in this world is a CCA-less Friday,btohqsg
As in meetings with pw teachers and all that thingy,btohqsg
I nvr meet with teachers one lol,btohqsg
maybe my jc life was fake,btohqsg
I mean you can like video call your teachers also,btohqsg
all from the comfort of your own home,btohqsg
As in for lesson and all that type of things need face to face ig?,btohqsg
Ya many video calls too that's a problem for people sometimes teachers device crash or overheat and end it earlier lol,btohqsg
After that next week will have x2 workload to make for all that lost time hahaha,btohqsg
but tbh I just want go home early,btohqsg
Anybody know when is Ngee Ann polytechnic‚Äôs track and field training,btohqsg
ya most of pw teachers are really good follow what they saying and all will go fine anyway?,btohqsg
oh go home early is rare in j1 mostly finish at 3-4 I think?,btohqsg
must the dip we take in poly be related to  uni,btohqsg
But ig its more worth it if u continue ur uni studies based on ur poly dip,btohqsg
If you get the good gpa you can go to any course in uni even unrelated lol,btohqsg
wait so u dropped out after..?,btohqsg
wise bc i might do that if the worst happens on the 28th,btohqsg
I finish As then went poly,btohqsg
did u use ur As or Os results for poly? or DAE,btohqsg
i thought u not active one,btohqsg
I want to be active in track and field while maintaining a meteoric GPA,btohqsg
And be in CCA champions at the same time,btohqsg
Idk how bloody hectic my polytechnic life is gonna be,btohqsg
seems like it wont be hectic then,btohqsg
International trade and business isn‚Äôt easy what,btohqsg
Especially if I want a 4.0 GPA,btohqsg
what's the difference between that and np biz studies,btohqsg
see you arnd biz sch hopefully,btohqsg
Business studies requires specialisation in the second year,btohqsg
my friend was in biz studies she say q easy lol,btohqsg
Business studies is different from ITB,btohqsg
ITB only has like 75 people,btohqsg
isnt BS like marketing all these stuff,btohqsg
There‚Äôs also entrepreneurship and human capital I think,btohqsg
I wanted business but figured im not the best at econs so i chose TRM bc its more ppl oriented jobs HAHA,btohqsg
Sometimes it‚Äôs like those 2CU mods like innova preventing you from getting your perfect GPA,btohqsg
u probably can get np scholarship,btohqsg
aiya whatever just apply after 28 January,btohqsg
no is they auto give u one iirc,btohqsg
at least according to my friend,btohqsg
Like after you apply for the course?,btohqsg
Well just have to wait until 28 January then,btohqsg
My main concern is the team projects,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs just paper exams I can mug,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs individual projects I might struggle but should be manageable if I just grind in the library,btohqsg
You‚Äôre in biz I assume got many group proj,btohqsg
ppl on reddit told me business more exam based,btohqsg
I think I probably applying for internship immediately after,btohqsg
Idk if there‚Äôs still innova I grad from NP years ago,btohqsg
why need to be so upz,btohqsg
Some innovation mod I think every student need take but I not in NP anymore so idk if it‚Äôs still there,btohqsg
I want to enter SMU so need top grades to be safe,btohqsg
And I want some holistic experience and networking,btohqsg
Can improve my inept social skills too,btohqsg
Many of my friends 3.9 because of that mod,btohqsg
this one don't go cca lol,btohqsg
I‚Äôm already in a parachurch lol,btohqsg
but these places really can network a lot,btohqsg
Probably gonna have a mission trip next year,btohqsg
singapore track and field in general is a mess,btohqsg
Ya I know the standards are trash,btohqsg
eh actl whats there to do,btohqsg
i nvr rlly found volunteer opportunities so i js stuck to library stuff,btohqsg
I going overseas for mission trip lol,btohqsg
building housing for people in Papua New Guinea,btohqsg
the nsa is in a mess,btohqsg
bruh moe apologised to the trans student and still used the wrong pronouns üòê,btohqsg
Notice how it referred to the student as ‚Äòhim‚Äô,btohqsg
I mean the concerned person is still biologically a male...,btohqsg
and she had mentioned herself that by making and forcing her to fit a male‚Äôs standards etc its causing her trauma and distress? so,btohqsg
wld u purposely call someone stupid if it causes the person distress?,btohqsg
Since MOE is conservative  they won‚Äôt be accepting of this,btohqsg
"Bec if its a publically made statement  it makes sense to use the ""right"" pronoun",btohqsg
Where will one draw the line then? Hypothetically if i were to demand that my pronoun was to be called fuckmaster69  would it be necessary for others to respect it and address it as such?,btohqsg
I dont think its about the public nature or the form of transmission  I think it reflects a stance by 'MOE' (or the guy who manages the MOE fb) that they do not take the pronoun thing seriously.,btohqsg
Ya but even if they didn't have such a stance  they technically have a valid reason to use a 'he' instead,btohqsg
But that would imply that they accept the agenda isnt it,btohqsg
even straits times  as an official news reporting site  and today wrote it as she yanno,btohqsg
"there is a possibility that the guy managing the account did that alleged ""mistake"" and is not representative of the views of MOE",btohqsg
^ and i dont think it wld be SUCH a big issue  if it didnt sound hypocriticalbut dont get me wrong yes  misgendering someone is bad enough as it is. Misgendering someone ON PURPOSE when u are clarifying about a situation like this is worse ukwim,btohqsg
like wouldnt he still be under moe,btohqsg
uh legally? based on what you learned  vicarious liability IF they get sued,btohqsg
common sense wise? people forget it within 3 days,btohqsg
and in a sense moe can be held for vicarious liability,btohqsg
very unlikely  because if MOE will be sued  there must be damages  and there is no damage here. Emotional hurt does not hold up in court,btohqsg
depending on jurisdiction  but singapore prima facie does not IIRC,btohqsg
cuz it caused further damage to her mental health and caused trauma,btohqsg
but could it be considered damage done tho? for not allowing her to go through the process,btohqsg
if its actually moe that did it,btohqsg
it depends if the court can establish that it is a big factor in causing damage to mental trauma  and there is no other substantial cause etc. it also has to be on a high degree of magnitude comparative to other cases etc.,btohqsg
but not very exactly sure for SG,btohqsg
you ah  mixing up your basic info sir  work harder be lawyer,btohqsg
so for damage caused to say that moe was negligent in duty of careit has to be a physical damage to play safe?,btohqsg
i dont even think there is a DOC in the first place,btohqsg
now that u said that mental health dh,btohqsg
cant even sue in the first place  much less win or lose,btohqsg
what the fuck didnt i ask to be addressed as fuckmaster69,btohqsg
Why this generation so sensitive call ‚Äúhim‚Äù also can die ah,btohqsg
"Not a good analogy. The term ""stupid"" is a subjective one. It could mean different things when asked to different people. It could mean doing smthg that defies common sense or having a low IQ(and what is considered low differs among people). But the pronoun 'he' refers to one being a male biologically and this is alr clearly defined by the scientific community so there shd be no debate on it.",btohqsg
one is gender and one is identity tho  like my gender is male  and there is no debate  but I can identify as fuckmasta69,btohqsg
i think the line gets blurry with trans because gender and identity is now intertwined,btohqsg
Exactly and so the message was only referring to the person's gender,btohqsg
I am very old alr (not a boomer). But i think like u haha,btohqsg
Bruhhh also people be simping for the chinese textbook characters lmaooo,btohqsg
also gen z: lmao i wanna die i wanna die i wanna die i wanna die,btohqsg
Nah those are Billie eilish fans,btohqsg
billie eilish : *breathes*14 year old girls : D E P R E S S I O N,btohqsg
"ok imagine you're a guy(u identify as one)  but everyone calls you a girl. you told them to STOP  countless of times  because you want to be called a guy. but even after everything you have done  they still called you a girl. now  you have a mental condition  but MOE decides to interfere with the treatment and says that no you can't do this. but all you want is for people to call you a GUY and not a GIRL  and MOE still doesn't allow you to go for hormonal treatment. Your school also doesn't allows you to go for these treatments because it could ""affect their reputation"". you are basically at wits end  because it stresses you out that you can't be identified as who you want others to call you. it's not really a sensitivity problem. why can't Singapore move forward and understand that these matters are quite important and in this case  detrimental to someone's mental health. how is SHE supposed to go to school and study in peace  knowing that so many people are going to misgender her  even if she told them not to?",btohqsg
"generally speaking   singapore policy making is very influenced by traditional ideas. how would you then take it into account? It is on a much larger scale than ""he/she/it/whatever"" pronoun game",btohqsg
Gender is strictly abt someone's biological identity,btohqsg
Don't confuse gender with sexual orientation,btohqsg
there are so many articles out there which explains about these misconceptions. do take some time read them.,btohqsg
you can choose not understand it. or maybe you just can't understand it. but the most basic way of approaching this problem is to respect their decisions. it's never up to anyone else to speak for these people.,btohqsg
if this is Singapore  does that mean we can't change? does that mean we have to move backwards instead of forward? does that mean these people don't deserve the BASIC RESPECT they deserve as humans?,btohqsg
i think it boils down to whether you want to respect them or not  calling what they want to be identified as won‚Äôt cause any harm to you  so why not just do it? Refusing to do so won‚Äôt make things any betteri strongly disagree about ‚Äòneopronouns‚Äô where people would literally make up their own pronouns  but if they want to be identified as those  why can‚Äôt we just respect them and do so?,btohqsg
May I ask if anyone here is studying computer engineering at local polytechnics?,btohqsg
Aiya at this point go run for office yourself already lah HAHAHAH,btohqsg
Go get a clipboard get some signatures and run for office yourself,btohqsg
Why Th is there such a huge debate over a simple pronoun,btohqsg
as singapore becomes more affluent  and bread and butter issues are less prevalent  inclusivity is now being more sought after,btohqsg
what the hell r u talking abt,btohqsg
get my pretty name out of your mouth,btohqsg
we are not the same  with or without,btohqsg
bc people above also refuse to acknowledge that gender pronouns of a person need not be the same as their biological genders?,btohqsg
Wait don‚Äôt argue yet  let me grab my popcorn first,btohqsg
Yeah next time all men can go female toilet and claim that they are female yah!,btohqsg
im referring to males who actl become females and are part of the transgender community,btohqsg
ofc they will use the females toilet,btohqsg
Exactly so for clarity reasons i think its fine to use the pronouns that relate to their biological gender,btohqsg
"but sir  define what is ""claim"" and what is an actual transition to male/female",btohqsg
i got the big sad card  so no sir i can say it all i want üëÅüëÑüëÅ,btohqsg
i'm not v educated on the topic but i do know that transition is defined by the person itself  normally via surgery from what i've seen la,btohqsg
What are u trying to say,btohqsg
uh bro what you saying is very conflicting  with respect. so is it when the surgery is completed  or by the person's subjective opinion,btohqsg
im not a sir pls HAHAHAHAHAAH but to claim is to state or assert that something is the case  typically without providing evidence or proof. an actual transition would involve surgical procedures to that person's body,btohqsg
that what you are saying is correct?,btohqsg
i guess  let's say they could be in the middle of the surgery and claim to be in 'transition',btohqsg
yes that's what i mean HAHA,btohqsg
even if you are not with the idea of transgender  please do respect the decision of people who become transgender. it takes a lot of courage to show themselves for who they truly are.,btohqsg
by addressing them using their preferred gender pronouns  you are being respectful.,btohqsg
dear mdm  so you are considering the drawing of the line when actual physical attempts are involved  but then the niche corner example of trans people who consider themselves trans  just pre-op or pre-hormone  wouldnt they be excluded from your definition,btohqsg
Wah yall really got nothing to do isit go find a part time job n earn some money kids,btohqsg
the whole idea of PC is to be inclusive  yet the very act of defining and limiting as well as setting boundaries is ironically exclusive,btohqsg
politically correct  like LGBTQ  non racism  blablabla,btohqsg
how troublesome is the human species : ),btohqsg
no they wouldn't. im just saying regarding how trans ppl become trans most of the time,btohqsg
that they wont be considered Trans?,btohqsg
that would upset alot of trans people,btohqsg
I FIND CAFE JOB SHE DW LET ME,btohqsg
YEAH CUZ NEED DEAL WITH CLEANING AND SERVICE BS,btohqsg
who claim they are trans but is unable to do the surgery due to exceptional and external circumstances I.E money  technology,btohqsg
im literally fucking trying to grow up,btohqsg
SAME but bc i weak cannot carry,btohqsg
i go retail also cannot cos she say what working hours too long,btohqsg
wait arent u in j2 tho,btohqsg
I WANT ADMIN JOB BUT ALL EITHER NEED MIN ALEVEL OR DIPLOMA OR NEED COMMIT 3 MONTHS,btohqsg
Why talk about other stuff  continue arguing pls I‚Äôm enjoying this,btohqsg
if the best happens im gg to poly but 3 months uhhh idk,btohqsg
"isnt there another ""cowboy like something""",btohqsg
sorry we hate being involved in drama,btohqsg
thats my friend? we matching names,btohqsg
anyone want to give me some free career counseling pls pm me,btohqsg
studying is not my strong suit,btohqsg
want to be my sugar mummy/daddy?,btohqsg
he asking for sugar mommy not baby,btohqsg
YO i asking for the same thing as him üòóbut i jk,btohqsg
idw this sugar baby so shit at law,btohqsg
Hey guys can I ask y'all smth?,btohqsg
Because any age group can learn,btohqsg
For example   some retrenched adults going for a course in polytechnics,btohqsg
I just gonna put as a poll and show my brother the result,btohqsg
Yea I know but like vvv big age gap tho?,btohqsg
Do you mean access to education or ability to learn,btohqsg
it doesn't matter i believe so,btohqsg
if a 36 year old can take o levels  why not?,btohqsg
Ideally no  but people might ostracize,btohqsg
I wanna hear both sides why yes n no tbh,btohqsg
3 said yes 6 said no so far,btohqsg
age definitely does not affect access  to education,btohqsg
I ask cuz partly I wanna do a research project on it and my brother is still sad over the fact that he is being judged,btohqsg
So it's like kill 2 birds W 1 stone hehe,btohqsg
but u hv to understand that people might see the age gap as something that could affect the project? (if poly or degree) but im sure if he can prove that he has the ability to do work  no one will really mind his age alr,btohqsg
Sorry if this is personal  but how much older is your brother compared to his peers?,btohqsg
same age also more common topics? it's inevitable,btohqsg
I got 18 year olds in my sec 4 class,btohqsg
Poly not uncommon to see people who r 2-3y older,btohqsg
Cause some people come from ITE,btohqsg
3 is not that big of an age haha as long as he uk interacts with more 17/18 year olds,btohqsg
I mean if an older foreigner is fine  shouldn't an older local be fine as well,btohqsg
Doesn't really matter  since u r just talking about age,btohqsg
He interact W my sis who is like 16 already having so much difficulties,btohqsg
he will be able to overcome that,btohqsg
Idk he talk to me like a kid tho I'm 18,btohqsg
i had a 22-23 yr old in my jc2 class,btohqsg
basically he will still hv a chance to meet ppl his age,btohqsg
i just think that he might have quite a bit of explaining to do since im sure ppl will ask him abt his age and all,btohqsg
unless ure like 30 years old talking to some 17/18 years old kids  idt it will be THAT awkw to start convos and stuff,btohqsg
Cuz another reason why I ask cuz,btohqsg
My bro put ite choices in his jae,btohqsg
Then he n level can go ite,btohqsg
I mean why shd those younger or older not be allowed to take education at a particular level?,btohqsg
I dont think people regularly ask about other people age thou  do they?,btohqsg
any form of education should be accessible to all  at any point in life  to anyone who are willing  as long as they qualify through merit,btohqsg
Well did U see moe? They have an age requirement to take Ns/Os/As,btohqsg
Then like age requirement to go uni too,btohqsg
Shd 9 year olds be allowed to take the O levels,btohqsg
Is it not a minimum age? Or is there a maximum age?,btohqsg
Like if they can und the material why not,btohqsg
There is no maximum age even,btohqsg
Maximum age given to go ITE.,btohqsg
I don't think age really matters that much tbh,btohqsg
I saw 1 uncle wear uniform also,btohqsg
Ya if said individual is able to cope,btohqsg
Aron which JC you heading to??,btohqsg
Tbh i felt like i could have skipped Sec 1 and 2 and went straight to 3,btohqsg
Well frankly if somebody is too old,btohqsg
Nanyang hopefully  I'd cry in HCI  RI or ACSI,btohqsg
They‚Äôll have difficulty relating to other members of the education system,btohqsg
I don't think it awkward still.,btohqsg
Does everybody seem to want nanyang,btohqsg
I can reach there in 30 mins and it starts at 8.30,btohqsg
I was pondering so heavily whether or not I should go for SAJC,btohqsg
I can't even go overseas study@chemcer,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt y‚Äôall want to go for US universities?,btohqsg
@chemcerok come meet me I let u read Ur fav textbook,btohqsg
Plus as Singaporeans we‚Äôll have an advantage,btohqsg
Is it true that IB is better than A levels?,btohqsg
I wanted to take IB  but then acsi so far away,btohqsg
Like for networking and all that,btohqsg
It's time for you to learn about affirmative action against asians,btohqsg
Each side says the other is better for some reason,btohqsg
I dont like long travel times sorry,btohqsg
Long travel time kills the soul,btohqsg
I also realised that I dont do well on IB,btohqsg
Organic is just this thicc already imagine the other topics,btohqsg
I want to join two CCAs in poly lol,btohqsg
Just for the sake of networking,btohqsg
@chemcerI let u read this Ur fav :>>>,btohqsg
International trade and business in Ngee Ann,btohqsg
Hopefully I can get an NP scholarship,btohqsg
He's probably already familiar with it,btohqsg
I know ppl in that course y3 HAHAH,btohqsg
Ooo Ngee Ann also very far away so cant be bothered. Why is Ngee ann and sp so close to each other?,btohqsg
I wanted SAJC but then realised I hated all of the subject combinations,btohqsg
So then I just screwed A levels and went for poly,btohqsg
Can go for pretty much any poly course so why not,btohqsg
How did you meet the ITB people??,btohqsg
I gave up halfway through after science paper and started league of legends,btohqsg
Can we have this as discussion- for the week,btohqsg
I‚Äôm already making an effort to network with Ngee Ann people lol,btohqsg
That's why they say legends never dies,btohqsg
Getting into IB or even ITB from there,btohqsg
I gave up for the literature paper,btohqsg
Tbh I think this chat made me damn nervous since a certain someone was destroying my confidence here,btohqsg
lol when I saw my name on my school leaderboard,btohqsg
then I looked at my certificate and saw C5 for literature,btohqsg
I feel u I had a C5 on my cert too,btohqsg
Idk if I can survive two CCAs In Ngee Ann though,btohqsg
CCA champions and track and field,btohqsg
Remember the time we thot we all gonna fail amaths haha,btohqsg
CCA champions is basically middleman services,btohqsg
Organise all the events for the other CCAs,btohqsg
A math this year had a dang weird moderation,btohqsg
Lmao I was actually depressed and couldnt study properly,btohqsg
English moderation was also very good,btohqsg
Shud my bro retake Os again? Tho he have to retake 2 more Os subjects again,btohqsg
Since cannot combined more than 2 sitting,btohqsg
mhm if got 1 year retake to save a few more year of life elsewhere why not?,btohqsg
My bro supposed get B3 but ended up w d7,btohqsg
Alot of students find it hard.,btohqsg
I predicted B4 and ended up with A1,btohqsg
But he 20+ alr and like nid go ns,btohqsg
Paper 1 i find it normal leh.,btohqsg
I tot Huan n gardener was the hardest üò¢,btohqsg
lol i predicted c6 and then i got c6jokes on me ü§£,btohqsg
Paper 2 was easier than 1 in my opinion,btohqsg
Lol I felt dang good after the English paper,btohqsg
But the most confusing moderation is combined humans,btohqsg
Explain why this gardener is disappointed.,btohqsg
GOT 45/50 FOR ALL MY SS PRACTICES,btohqsg
i screwed up ss and still got A2 lmao,btohqsg
Ya I actually kinda liked SS,btohqsg
I didnt finish both humans papers haha,btohqsg
If ss was a pure subject,btohqsg
ya I should have screwed it up too,btohqsg
Maybe I would have gotten an A,btohqsg
Would have given up long ago if it was on its own,btohqsg
Everyone thot it was korean war lmao,btohqsg
Ya but everybody that screwed the paper up did better than me,btohqsg
I am talking about 2020 paper.For me P1 not that bad. But P2 need alot of thinking involve.,btohqsg
Plus there is error also in my presentation.,btohqsg
maybe that shit is the reason why ur grade kena pulled down,btohqsg
Ya I think I choked for history,btohqsg
Honestly I think since a lot of people studied wrong hist topic for combined  moderation was more generous than expected  but then a lot of people did worse than expected,btohqsg
But I studied the correct topic for history,btohqsg
brooo its lucky that my cher convince me to study stalin,btohqsg
I think that happened to 2018,btohqsg
I did 1 prelim paper before the paper haha,btohqsg
Cuz 15marks thrown away into the drain for essay,btohqsg
me studied geog but ended up forgotting everything during the exam :/,btohqsg
Ah but science moderation quite expected ah.,btohqsg
i forgot the amath qns alr sia,btohqsg
I screwed up my combined science paper,btohqsg
So u didnt go HCI? I thot u wanted to go there?,btohqsg
honestly im kinda curious how they mark the phy graph for practical  cos i didn't draw it lmak ü§£,btohqsg
i screw up my chem i get b3,btohqsg
I mean it's hard to predict el,btohqsg
How tf can u predict compo and compre?,btohqsg
lol just predicted ill just pass like i always doi mean tats what i scored lmao,btohqsg
Usually they will ask u to find the maximum and the minimum value of maybe 3 sin theta + 4 cos theta,btohqsg
Sorry I mean it's hard to estimate ur marks for compo and compre,btohqsg
But in this question they put a square.,btohqsg
the emath bellcurve abit confusing tbh,btohqsg
like some of my friends got A2 even tho they calc 90+ or smth,btohqsg
They calculated method marks too leniently?,btohqsg
but they did say they check presentation lo,btohqsg
I don't think so. I actually need to picture the diagram in your head or draw out the diagram,btohqsg
unless they overlook some other presentation & careless mistakes lor,btohqsg
I think that is the case,btohqsg
i predicted around 90 got A1,btohqsg
That is what i do. To understand how this thing work,btohqsg
My bro got like71/73 P172/91P2Got A1 overall for emath,btohqsg
weird thing is the ones that say they can A1 they A2 then the opposite,btohqsg
Btw is it true that a lot of people going NY?,btohqsg
I didnt know it was this popular lmao,btohqsg
Ah hopefully I can get in,btohqsg
u nvr see ¬≤ or u dont understand the ¬≤ thing ur kinda gone,btohqsg
OH YA U REMINDED ME OF ONE QNS THAT MY BRO ASK,btohqsg
i hope i can get into tjc tho,btohqsg
Pray for me lmao. Hopefully it doesnt become 5,btohqsg
Honestly it confused me when I saw the qns HAHA,btohqsg
power of 2 means base is 2,btohqsg
I think that's what I put,btohqsg
Cuz this is what I would put,btohqsg
let just see the tys ans,btohqsg
if have we wont see super old people getting degrees,btohqsg
im q curious abt the pure phy moderation tho,btohqsg
Amath distinction rate is quite high,btohqsg
amath at least 85 or so for a1,btohqsg
Naw this year a math is definitely not that high,btohqsg
apparently my sch art had 60% fail?,btohqsg
haha i thought so  but my frens did an estimation that time lel,btohqsg
My friend left 25% of the paper blank,btohqsg
70 got b3  90 a2  94 a1,btohqsg
but of course  since its estimated scores  it may not be 100% accurate,btohqsg
lmao my friend left like 50% of the pure geog ppr to ans the other 50% accurately,btohqsg
But did this year do better or worse than last? Anyone know?,btohqsg
The people who commented there disagree,btohqsg
My bro got like71/73 P172/91P2Got A1 overall for emath,btohqsg
No one said anyth so I just repost here Haha,btohqsg
That what i am trying to say. If u know how it works then good. But dk how its works better with drawing of graph.,btohqsg
