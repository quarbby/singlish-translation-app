I stuck in woodlands no jobs to go home,btohqsg
Honestly i didnt know  all the online tutorial i CBF to watch  i just skipped all and took the test,btohqsg
The questions mostly common sense so obv scored 100 and they allow me to drive liaoz,btohqsg
I dont know where to watch those tutorials online now also,btohqsg
I did a crown plaza job also......go there on stack and just drop item outside the hotel i happy AF liaoz...didnt even think of secure zone fee,btohqsg
Doubt so because CS will ask you why never say that time,btohqsg
If the same day still got chance,btohqsg
The biggest tip I gotten was 50sgd :),btohqsg
Ask them for this fee they rather activate their own guys,btohqsg
This is a credit job. No need to ask them . Contact CS and they will award you with the secured zone,btohqsg
Wait is this cash or credit ?,btohqsg
Itâ€™s like decathlon that order a 2.4 van by mistake to transport a small dumbbell. Lol ðŸ˜‚ I just take the job. Ayio. You all shouldnâ€™t be afraid that customer will cancel if they order to airport and you already pick it up   you shd be entitled to the secured zone 15sgd. If client not happy then pay 50% to cancel Lor.,btohqsg
It seems like too many drivers closing one eye cause they donâ€™t want to deal with the CS or afraid to lose the job. Come on la ! You all have rights too   as long as you follow what lalamove policy states you shouldnâ€™t be afraid.,btohqsg
@adminpls pin this as well lol,btohqsg
Noted....will try to do as advised....thks for the tips,btohqsg
Tips for lalamoveIf wrong location- you will be compensated with extra stop fees. Do not be afraid to let customer know that wong location is chargeable as one extra stop + mileage.If secured zone not reflected- you have to contact CS and let them confirm itâ€™s a secured zone. If CS say itâ€™s not .try justifying to them on their secured zone guide lines. Do note that even though itâ€™s secured zone customers sometimes refuse to pay so you will need CS to help. However sometimes CS will say itâ€™s not secured   if that happens you can try getting paid from the client directly by showing them the lalamove secured zone list of places. This is the best way to get paid. Base on experience credit jobs are easier to get the extra fees.For items that exceed dimensions- always have proof via pictures. Carrying a portable luggage scale and measuring tape helps. Getting upgraded only works if you take lower tier vehicle job. If you ride a bike and the weight exceed you will not get an upgrade. However thereâ€™s a method Iâ€™ll recommend if you ride a bike and the weight exceed and itâ€™s supposed to be a car job you could also let the client know and manually calculate the car fees and tell the customer if he/she is okay to pay extra as itâ€™s suppose to be a car job. Most of them would not mind paying. You could also let them know if they cancel they will have to pay you 50% .If thereâ€™s anything wrong with your order  always screenshot so you wonâ€™t have to exit chat to refer to order number . Also try studying the pricing so you can manually calculate if your too lazy to contact CS and want to take matters to your own hands.,btohqsg
If CS donâ€™t stand up for your rights. You have to stand up for your own rights! ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Oh also I forgot to mention if client Is slow for pickup. Example: When pickup suppose to be at 12pm and at 12pm its not ready. Let CS know that customer is not ready .Do not wait until after 10mins to contact CS .if the pick up is not ready when i arrive  I always assume that customer will be late. So my message to CS will be . â€œ hi for my order  #1234-1234 just want to inform that Iâ€™m already at the location and the item is still not ready for pick up in case thereâ€™s a charge for waiting timeâ€œ,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice n knowledge sean... i learnt today,btohqsg
Anyone who get this pls go ask for the $15 dun spoil market,btohqsg
Oh they didnt cancel lol thank you@btcseannykor kor,btohqsg
In case you all donâ€™t know supply base (non military) like logistics hub that require pass change is also considered a secured zone. Take picture of the pass office and inform CS that itâ€™s a supply base logistics hub. I requested for secured zone fee atNTUC Warehouse @ Joo Koon before andI got it after taking pictures of the pass office because they require pass change .,btohqsg
The secure zone it for pick up and drop off right?,btohqsg
Because I saw food order delivery to them too,btohqsg
Secured zone is for drop off. If pick up at airport is not considered a secured zone .,btohqsg
Hi all  may i ask the procedure for additional waiting time at pick up point,btohqsg
When pickup suppose to be at 12pm and at 12pm its not ready. Let CS know that customer is not ready .Do not wait until after 10mins to contact CS .if the pick up is not ready when i arrive  I always assume that customer will be late. So my message to CS will be . â€œ hi for my order  #1234-1234 just want to inform that Iâ€™m already at the location and the item is still not ready for pick up in case thereâ€™s a charge for waiting timeâ€œ. After pick up contact CS again and let them know the time you waited theyâ€™ll add accordingly. You can also let customer know and ask them to pay. If they donâ€™t want to pay you and contact CS for help again,btohqsg
Hi Sean  thanks for sharing. So when i reached the location do i swipe arrival? Waiting time starts from the scheduled timing or drivers arrival time? When livechat do i have to wait for an agent or i can start to write in before they ask me to speak to an agent? Sorry so many questions  newbie here ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Nth to stack on this mon bluesssss,btohqsg

The restricted / secured zone list,btohqsg
Y no one wanna take whyq food car orders,btohqsg
Nope I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s secured zone. However no harm trying to smoke your way.,btohqsg
For waiting time I like to charge the customer directly so I donâ€™t have to pay comsðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Longest I ever waited was 1hr minus 10mins so I told customer thereâ€™s a waiting charge of 50mins . And I ask them to pay me cash. They seem pretty cool about it since they made me wait so long.,btohqsg
Needed to change pass to.use service lift,btohqsg
Hi all can verify abt Lala subsidy,btohqsg

Ikea  haha weekdays is dead ones... Except for Friday to Sunday...,btohqsg
Similar to sail. But unfortunately no secured zone.,btohqsg
I ever accepted an order to changi prison.. And its not considered secured zone. Trapped there for 2 plus hours. Changi prison guard forced my arm rest up  causing spring to be damaged. Not able to claim for that.Called customer and lalamove about the secure zone on changi prison  and they were in disbelief that its so tight.End of day  amount earned is not worth the troubles of everything out from car for x Ray  full search  change pass  whatever u can think of.. And the repair of my arm rest,btohqsg
