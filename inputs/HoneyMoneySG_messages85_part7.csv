Uob krisflyer excluded transaction put AMAZE* TRANSIT*   does that mean amaze is excluded?,btohqsg
It means Amaze is excluded if you use it for MRT (if u want to tap it for MRT  tap it with UOB KF card directly)(see updated message),btohqsg
AMAZE transactions with other merchants (e.g. Uniqlo) should still work,btohqsg
Sorry  correction  Transit is for top up at general ticketing machine. (But i do tap my UOB KF instead of Amaze-with-UOBKF just to be safe),btohqsg

Tax relief is for high income people. He can top up SRS for same relief also.,btohqsg
how much is cap for SA and SRS? Why is it the same?,btohqsg
$15300 for SRS. Cap no idea for SA I as I am those who transfers OA to SA last time,btohqsg
Can do top up to SA and SRS on same year? and tax relief for both SA top up and SRS top up?,btohqsg
RSTU is $8K for self (total combined with BHS MA VC). SRS is $15.3K. both relief can be claimed in the same yr. Chris' year-end video touched on these,btohqsg
"SRS and it's investments won't give you the guaranteed 4.08% risk free interest.It's very misleading for you to say ""tax relief is for high income people"".Your median income earner would definitely hit the 7% tax bracket and in calculations pay at least 2k in income taxes.And if your point of getting tax reliefs by topping up SRS  your next point of paying taxes and fees to withdraw from SRS early won't make sense anymore.Your CPF life payouts don't get assessed as income  but withdrawing SRS after the retirement age does.Nothing wrong doing either/both ways  but it's best to lay it out for people who ask and let them pick what's best suited for them.",btohqsg
Hi  does anybody know if paying conservancy charges by credit card counts towards the uob one account card spend?,btohqsg
Thks for the reminder.  Forgot needs to maintain 6months.  Will close after 6months then.  Again thks. üëç,btohqsg
To choose between top up OA or SRS. I prefer SRS help to save tax but in the event you need to take out the money  you can do so with some penalty. You can‚Äôt with CPF. That why top up CPF is for high income earner who don‚Äôt need a backup plan. SRS can save as much as $3k of tax per year. you can also buy SSB or stocks without much restrictions at least for SG blue chip dividend stock to try make up for that 4% yield.,btohqsg
"Top-up OA?SRS is also meant for retirement  if you ""need to take out the money""  you have to re-evaluate your savings for rainy day.",btohqsg
For my case  I already above FRS. Can‚Äôt top up anymore. Thus SrS. But in the early years I have been contributing to SRS and transfer OA to SA.,btohqsg
SRS is another layer on top of the base CPF. How many here have SRS.Most friends I know don‚Äôt have.,btohqsg
You cannot even top-up OA  less getting tax relief from it... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èBut if you're talking about SA then like I said before  nothing wrong doing either/both ways  lay out the facts  let them evaluate. Let them decide if they want to put somewhere that grows4.08% p.a. risk-free by defaultor somewhere that they have to invest the money to try challenge against that. Not forgetting the OA he puts in FD can be returned to OA and still be used for housing or education without penalty.No one said topping up SRS is wrong  I'm sure the people here who have hit FRS on SA are topping up SRS already.,btohqsg
Would like to know as well? Anybody?,btohqsg

Hi  just to clarify this citi top up. If i enroll today I just need to top up 100k by 31 Jan? Then on 31 Jan citibank will look at my account balance and if I have topped up 100k in the month of Jan I will qualify for the $910? (after maintaining balance for 3 months),btohqsg
It is a better alternative if people want to put money for relief but may have plan in the future to use the money to seek better yield or opportunities if they need. Put in CPF  money is gone till you hit the age while SRS still give you the flexibility to use it if required. CPF still get fill up every month from work anyway.,btohqsg
Housing or education will still be covered by the CPF you contributing every month unless you take loan that are higher than your CPF contribution ,btohqsg
No right no wrong but just offering a view that If you want tax relief  SRS offer a viable alternative in case they need the money earlier in life. You still can use the SRS for investment and with less restrictions than OA.,btohqsg
Does anyone know MCC of bumble/tinder etc.? üòÖ,btohqsg
