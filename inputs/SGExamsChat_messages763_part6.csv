i think my class no one got to uni except for 5 people,btohqsg
eh bro uk SUTD hard to get one,btohqsg
big 3 was out of their choice,btohqsg
the last i heard la they dun see gpa but your minimum should be above there to even qualify,btohqsg
from what i read online ah,btohqsg
and this is like 2021 info so,btohqsg
my year NTU aeronautical was like 3.5 ish so yeah damn diff,btohqsg
you'll probs never deal with it unless you do physics,btohqsg
Holistic there's always outliers in data but at the end of the day it's like saying your snr won 4D and u expect that u gonna win 4D too,btohqsg
In fact I expect it to be worse as NUS pivots to Holistic and tbvh NTU like half convinced at this point,btohqsg
Of course they don't. But that's the first thing they look at,btohqsg
If they included my data it would be 1.98,btohqsg
Assuming ceteris paribus conditions when the world ain't like that,btohqsg
Quite a lot also Y3 their gpa shit then they gamble at Alevels some make it so when they grad they apply as Alevels candidate but in the polys eyes it's still entry into uni,btohqsg
In fact they damn fucking ticked off that they couldn't use my data for their GES,btohqsg
Legit I mean in the polys eyes u went into uni what with their qualification,btohqsg
Even if it wasn't the deciding factor,btohqsg
Then u also have the misleading claims for local med. Nursing diploma went in to YLL med... what they didn't tell you is he 3.95 or 3.99 and he took Alevels after first time failed and his Alevels was AAA/A,btohqsg
huh only 1 ppl grad from SMU?,btohqsg
there is a reason why sit is called home for poly grads lol,btohqsg
That one is 80% Poly ppl,btohqsg
gpa too low to enter NTU/NUS/SMU but no money for private/oversea uni,btohqsg
but damn.. 1 person only and not just SMU alot other also,btohqsg
sutd is by interview n stuff right,btohqsg
oh its for rp only ah,btohqsg
Cuz of holistic. The intake actually dropped lmao,btohqsg
others its about there i think. dun belive the bs ur lecturer say about certain poly gpa is weighted higher,btohqsg
wait so RP to uni abt a few hundred oni?,btohqsg
told me uni staff gonna take SP grad more than ppl from RP,btohqsg
but imo its the same la,btohqsg
but he told me smth which is quite real,btohqsg
So even if it is trying to.. which I mean I guess the intake size decrease so less spots,btohqsg
go for the lousy course and ace it so u get 4.0 easily,btohqsg
like easier compared to getting 4.0 in a harder course,btohqsg
so easier to get scholarship sponsorship all that,btohqsg
i tot gonna be <1% lol,btohqsg
very worthy of respect to the 2% tho,btohqsg
That's all I am going to say,btohqsg
It also has to be a relevant diploma,btohqsg
If u wanna smurf do it at Uni level... cuz Post grad is a lot more free than Undergrad.,btohqsg
hii can I ask what does SOI stand for,btohqsg
Cuts out Med and quite a lot of STEM courses,btohqsg
Let's just say I graduate with a BA in History with FCH. I can apply and qualify to MD  JD and not to mention I can go back to PhD in History,btohqsg
I do a Diploma in idk Chinese at NP I graduate I can only apply to relevant courses mostly in CoHASS and maybe computing,btohqsg
Even if u dont Post grad u go out with BA u get higher GES,btohqsg
Win Win either ways and since its a local uni most general jobs and Government Jobs are open at executive level,btohqsg
If I grad with BMS diploma I come out become technican level,btohqsg
like few hundred dollar more compared to ite cert only,btohqsg
It's like artificially depressed wages for the actual knowledge u have,btohqsg
U learn so much and so much stress if u fuck up become test tube washer,btohqsg
