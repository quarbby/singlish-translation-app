my love for cement never withers. slow and steady...,btohqsg
One big wall at 59 today,btohqsg
Lol yesterday don‚Äôt have. Why ah,btohqsg
I think VV3 got BB block. Most likely can fly soon,btohqsg
Ya. Ben caught the Jerry virus. üòÜüòÜüòÜ,btohqsg
I holding my vv3 at 70 for 2 weeks + already  want to offload above 80 at least  no less,btohqsg
If 68 clear then good. Volume churning play by them,btohqsg
68 is to churn volume? Only 2 orders. 500k and 25k,btohqsg
The VV3 stacks very nicely lined.Now   I invite Vividthree BBs to start the performance,btohqsg
vividthree dayw2 in wabc formationw2 66 px hit 66now is critical,btohqsg
To get into Top 30 volume need to cross 5000 lots volume . Let‚Äôs see,btohqsg
Past few trading sessions vv3 not so many blocks  hopefully today will be the day üöÄ,btohqsg
MasterSgYuancan you please chart for smm üôèüèªüôèüèªtks,btohqsg
yea and they have not been anywhere near this stacked .,btohqsg
envirohub slowly but steady going up,btohqsg
LifeBrandz 26 sell q top up to 11m then remove again,btohqsg
Gke not outflow red but goes up....careful,btohqsg
Same for v2y net outflow red but goes up,btohqsg
One chan the other is Dr koh cordlife right,btohqsg
sold long time ago at 27 when it rebounded,btohqsg
Dr Koh Cordlife cofounder is the independent director of VV3.He recently bought shares of VV3   over. 10 000 lots at $0.070(sept 2020)This brought about attention to this counter I reckon,btohqsg
If vv3 cross 70 will fly,btohqsg
the blocks all started to disappear,btohqsg
whats his useridwhole street of JJ,btohqsg
Ya..got his message too..o deleted straight,btohqsg
but also say no common group.,btohqsg
Is vp going to fly too,btohqsg
Everytime LB got 800 shares buying that day will chiong.,btohqsg
The regulators got mention the vaccine should still work even with the new strain  but pending confirmation,btohqsg
Tested a small sell vivid 69. Buyer is macquarie and HSBC. Lets go!,btohqsg
ya so the bet on the confirmation is a big one. a sleeping loss trade haha,btohqsg
Nah not venturing into medical. Risk way too big now with limited upside imo. When they down  they fall pretty quickly,btohqsg
Those manage to scoop at 24 huat ah,btohqsg
agree. i think got upside but equivalent or even more downsidefor the good of mankindi hope the new strain is just an excuse for bb to buy cheap other stuff.,btohqsg
Hyphen 320 keep topping up sia,btohqsg
Even if existing vaccine doesn't work on new variant  think Pfizer and Modena can still make a few modification on their vaccine and be ready in a month or two.,btohqsg
New technology makes vaccine  quick and easy.,btohqsg
I hold MT but I also hope the virus get beaten soon and world goes back to normal. Think MT without virus is still a strong pick. The CEO already projecting beyond covid and it looks good for them.,btohqsg
All medical plays have amassed big capital in pandemic now focus should be on management plans and executionLikely diversification will happenJust hoping not buying crap for sake of buying,btohqsg
MT benefited strongly from the pandemic no doubt. It is a catalyst for them to get on the world stage and be get recognition. Now that they have a bigger share of the market  they don't really need to rely on virus news anymore. Though the threat of Disease X still hangs around and govts around the world definitely will stockpile more and not be caught with pants down again.,btohqsg
If one is hoping COVID to get worse just do your medical shares can riseWhat difference is there between u and the black hearted merchants who produced food that poisoned and killed people (such as the toxic milk powder case in China years back)May argue you didn‚Äôt cause it unlike the milk powder producers.However they didn‚Äôt set out to kill anyone. Just want to maximize profitsIf your life stands in the way of profits  too bad u can die as long as they get the profitsIn this sense is similar to medical shareholders too?,btohqsg
Think any stock we can buy will always have some bad parts about them. Buy gold  oil  lumber get blamed for toxic environmental waste...etc,btohqsg
Those not vested can watch. Personally 3 stock heavily recommended as of now. Jiutian/medtec/riverstone,btohqsg
MT likely will be quite strong after all the things die down,btohqsg
Wah first time see hamper give monopoly,btohqsg
No le i just say i do trade a bit here n therr than bang,btohqsg
