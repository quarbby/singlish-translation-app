Tofu  u need to run faster lah.,btohqsg
Huh ? What do you mean,btohqsg
lol u r a pretty girl  wont understand how ugly me feels.,btohqsg
I think you have to read my meaning again. I mean to say definition of rich varies between different people but i never mean rich important or not,btohqsg
There will always be a privileged part of a person that they cannot fully take in how others can feelPretty vs uglyRich vs poorWell off vs not well offHealthy vs sickMale vs femaleList is endless....end of the day I just hope people will be empathic  not be too judgemental etc...its hard of course  but that's how life is,btohqsg
I still single   maybe you married . So surely you got people want and someone find you very pretty,btohqsg
Many ugly people are married tooâ€¦..,btohqsg
Agreed. But chicken = 'No hahaha,btohqsg
hahaha marriage is shite. dont fall for it.,btohqsg
wait what... where the chickens come in.,btohqsg
Yeah that means they not ugly because they are still prettiest in someone eyes,btohqsg
Nah.  Not running for anything. The rest can go for the run.,btohqsg
They must be really blinded by loveâ€¦..,btohqsg
That's like a topic few days back I think.,btohqsg
Must feel the partner pretty and good so can love right ?,btohqsg
Ok gong xi gong xiSomeone blind enough to choose u,btohqsg
oops  no no u go experience u own. I am saying mine is over.,btohqsg
Singapore Association for the Blind plays its anthem...,btohqsg
I believe if U start running U will drop pieces of yourself along the way,btohqsg
I think not every one choose partner because of looks?Some is because they kindOr smart Or maybe arranged marriages Or money,btohqsg
Just sharing.. to be honest .. i never had any ex that is consider handsome before .,btohqsg
Maybe fry a bit first  can save.,btohqsg
Or maybe bedroom skill is so good She choose to off lights every time ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
u show pic... later is some korean oppa how.,btohqsg
But first impression is always looks first,btohqsg
some is long time friend already then got feeling then get together,btohqsg
Definitely whoever choose base only on looks i think is looking for trouble in future hahaha esp in marriage,btohqsg
Beauty is eye of the beholder...later she thinks not handsome but for us is god mode,btohqsg
I definitely wouldnâ€™t mind this LOLLLLLLL,btohqsg
bedroom skills can learnt together and experiment together to make it better n better,btohqsg
"Reminds me of the ""cover the face  attack the base"" theory",btohqsg
ok u use ur skillfuture credits upskill.,btohqsg
That is if u got the heart to want to improve,btohqsg
This one sure bistro uncle like,btohqsg
hahahah note that if bedroom skills good  can choose to switch off lights.,btohqsg
but must have the right partnerâ€¦some partners just want it to be over quickly,btohqsg
