Imagine asking people instead of going to the best jc aka an insititute for millennials,btohqsg

I believe going to 2-5 pointer JCs will put u down with a lot if stress,btohqsg
NJC has the standards and not soo much stress,btohqsg
I am not from NJc so i may be off,btohqsg
Ik a lot of slack fkers from single rp schs,btohqsg
While ik ppl from low to mid tier jc being fking stressed also,btohqsg
There are all kinds of people in each sch haha cant compare liddat,btohqsg
They can be because all the parents watching them to see if they are participating at school at home  or skipping at home ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Oh no. No more holidays and esports at home liao,btohqsg
looking at epalgg is so funny,btohqsg

Moreover  the integration between ip students and o lvl students may be a bit rocky,btohqsg
nj has ip kids as well,btohqsg
I have o lvl friends who said mixing arnd with ip students is difficult coz they aldy formed friendships circles,btohqsg
Yeah sure! Actually every school can teach well but some high tier schools have better opportunities and programmes which can be an edge over others in student development,btohqsg
Sure but there's some things you can do in one school but not another,btohqsg
Good luck to those taking o lvls this year!,btohqsg
my JC's olympiad training only lasted for a month,btohqsg
Some people have been olympiad training since primary too,btohqsg
I signed up for Olympiad and all they did was buy the entry ticket for me,btohqsg
Unless they had some secret Olympiad class I wasnâ€™t invited to,btohqsg
The ticket doesn't come with free training,btohqsg
Sure but I was in the fm class,btohqsg
If there was an Olympiad class Iâ€™d have heard of it from my classmates,btohqsg
Plus even when I was taking H3 I still didnâ€™t get a secret Olympiad class when I signed up,btohqsg
Must be a really exclusive club,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t have the motivation back then cause I just saw Olympiad as a â€˜show up and have funâ€™ thing,btohqsg
I'm also just a filthy casual,btohqsg
My sec school had an olympiad class,btohqsg
Didn't go for it after one year,btohqsg
