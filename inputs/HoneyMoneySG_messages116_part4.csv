yeah i think we over think it la...i think the SPIRIT is they don't want the big funds that are already inside UOB One account to be withdrawn and immediately put back in...,btohqsg
yes if follow the TNC strictly.. but i think very hard to enforce / program the system.,btohqsg
I mean if cannot earmark then find somewhere else lo. They prefer 1 day missing the big funds or all the way missing the big funds hahah,btohqsg
Not difficult ba. They just use all withdrawn amounts from all accounts for the last 30 days can already.,btohqsg
ALL ACCOUNTS LEH....how can anybody with UOB accounts not touch their accounts for 30 days.,btohqsg
If their UOB accounts really only used for promo lor haha,btohqsg
does Ega still earns cash back for giro of cc bills?,btohqsg
ya loh damn stupid... imagine i transfer in $5k into uob account say to pay UOB credit card bills. also kenna,btohqsg
You can opt to pay direct via bill payment  transfer or GIRO haha,btohqsg
UOB cards no support FAST yet i think.. i usually move the money into a uob savings account.. then use UOB app to pay instantly within app.,btohqsg
Can. I transfer through FAST before. But now I pay with bill payment. Not good for JIT warriors as it takes up to 3 working days to reflect. But as long 1 working day before you transfer should not kena fee.,btohqsg
Hi Guys  seeking advice. Has been investing since 17.Jan.21. And this is the returns. Should i just ditch and take the loss?,btohqsg
Anyone can give me some recommendations on this? Thanks in advance! üôè,btohqsg
Wait for uob promo and lock in 50k,btohqsg
This means you still lost 4k+ after accounting for the dividends? Or you made a couple hundred?,btohqsg
I agree w Melvin. And i think shouldnt wait till last minute to transfer. Easy to forget and miss deadline.,btohqsg
Depend on your spending habit to be honest. My dad have no problem waiving it. U can always cancel the card if annual fee cant be waive,btohqsg
Usually excluded  go with safer purchases from this videohttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I,btohqsg
Wa  ouch. Personally I would just take the L. Coz still need to pay fees to Syfe while not making money.,btohqsg
Reits have been underperforming due to the high interest rate environment in the recent years.,btohqsg

Not that I'm complaining  but is anyone else continuing to get 1% cashback from hsbc credit card spends? Altho T&Cs said 1% is only for debit card  but I'm still getting it from cc. Hope hsbc doesn't enforce this strictly...,btohqsg
You are OK with the app running in the background of your phone  sharing your Internet connectivity and phone's processing power for some petty amount of money?! üò±,btohqsg

Hello All  Is there a limit on how much i can swipe Instarem Amaze card in Forex when i am travelling abroad  like the SGD 1000 applies for forex wallet transactions too?,btohqsg
Can you elaborate? Credit card limit?,btohqsg
Oh okay  where can i find it? On the app?,btohqsg
limited by your own credit card credit limit. No limit at Amaze side.,btohqsg
So i could top up my amaze wallet as much as my credit card limit is?,btohqsg
And use it without any charges from instarem,btohqsg
Honey gain reminds me of SoCash where people use it to earn extra cash. But know the risk that you don‚Äôt know what internet traffic is flowing through your device. It may risk label as riskware and you may be blocked and blacklisted especially by banking apps.,btohqsg
amaze wallet limit is 5k  Amaze+linked card no limit,btohqsg

"New to Tbill. Planning to place $100K and go for non-competitive. What is the rough range for successful allotment based on recent past T-bill event? Eg 90K ...70K or 50K. Trying to get a feel of the ""ballpark"" amount to place for Tbill. No point placing 100K if allotment was max. @$40K for the past few auctions. Any sifu care to share their experience? Thanks in advance!",btohqsg
If you want ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù 100% allocation then go for competitive with a slightly lower rate like 3.5ish. Chances will be a lot better,btohqsg
yes lost 4k even after 5k divident...really bullocks.,btohqsg
If I use Amaze with CRMC overseas only for cashback. Does this mean overall rewards is (2.27% cashback from CRMC - ard 2% markup from Amaze = .27%)?,btohqsg

Hey guys  why is it that Amaze can link with Mastercard and not VISA but Heymax can link with VISA and not Mastercard? Asking purely out of curiosity,btohqsg
