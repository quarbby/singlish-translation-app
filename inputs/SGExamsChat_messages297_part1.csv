whoever got recieve ans key for physics pls send here asap thanks,btohqsg
yall need change ke to m/s,btohqsg
The idea of SI is for all the equations in Physics to be standised,btohqsg
Btw 95km/h is 25m/s right or smth like that,btohqsg
I put kelvin for unit is it wrong,btohqsg
first q was SI base units?,btohqsg
Cause I didn't study that part n it looked a little sus,btohqsg
But its not a base unit too,btohqsg
Is my mark gone since I never convert,btohqsg
6 SI base units that are in syllabusmole  metre  kilograms  seconds  ampere  kelvin,btohqsg
but if you write as an answer  should still be given the mark,btohqsg
never see question yet  I can't tell you,btohqsg
There's 1/2 Mark in physics right,btohqsg
1 out of 2 yes0.5 no,btohqsg
Theres no 0.5 out of 1?,btohqsg
still enough time to work hard to get full 30% from MCQ,btohqsg
U forget to 3cm I forgot to x 5 ü§°,btohqsg
how do y‚Äôall solve the mass question ?,btohqsg
yo any jc student doing h2/h3 physics can anyone remind me whats the equations for acceleration and velocity in a circle ah,btohqsg
a = v¬≤/r or rw¬≤ or vw   where w is omegadon't think have formula for v.,btohqsg
v is usually given or found from other things,btohqsg
thanks man  but do yall do curvelinear?,btohqsg
need this for my uni stuff thanks alot bro ‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg
Hmm  I can help a little with uni physics,btohqsg
ah that means no  then its ok,btohqsg
really uh you mind if i PM you?,btohqsg
i struggling with uni level physics,btohqsg
only year 1 I can try,btohqsg
If it is totally mechanical engineering then I can't help.,btohqsg
maybe can show some sample questions  I can try later,btohqsg
mode bro  i didnt touch engie stuff for like 2 sem and i forgot how to integrate ahhaa,btohqsg
integration should still be able to help. I'm actively teaching students that  so still can,btohqsg
Integration within physics likely should still be ok.,btohqsg
but if it is professionally ME  then I can't,btohqsg
oo vector calculus. Reminds me Phy olympiad daysBut this one generally out of my league,btohqsg
triple integration maybe still can do as a maths question  but I think there are maths degree people here who are able to help better,btohqsg
ya fk that shit idk what on earth is going on anymore sia,btohqsg
Yall in JC solving god level equations alr,btohqsg
driving to fetch kids from childcare. Later I write out some study tips which help me go from dunno what happen to scoring A,btohqsg
Is vectors more complicated in jc,btohqsg
I already forgot all my JC equationsüòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
Evolution of vectors from sec to jc be like stonks,btohqsg
Anybody take triple sci in JC? How do u gods survive that sub combi,btohqsg
u need math and a contrasting subject,btohqsg
I heard some ppl take trip sci,btohqsg
Alvl 'triple' sci is 2sci + math,btohqsg
I read  somewhere from reddit  that ppl took phy chem bio,btohqsg
Or I might be wrong la,btohqsg
maybe they took in o levels,btohqsg
Most likely IB or the Alvls in UK,btohqsg
