You mentioned he big pro leh 😂,btohqsg
Bank loan int... After yrs.. total shld be half the capital,btohqsg
So paying half times more than wat u r borrowing,btohqsg
Banks r smart... Got calc. Real value of currency decade ahead...,btohqsg
So tat they wont lose out,btohqsg
Otherwise u think hw banks so huat,btohqsg
So people sell after a few years when property value up to upgrade or pay down capital with savings before refinance again hopefully at lower interest rate.,btohqsg
When ppl sell their property after yrs to appreciate...they confirm get their cash back...but qn is.. Wats the real value of their sale proceed in comparison to their AMT they paid to return bank loan...?,btohqsg
This is like basic to all Econs students and biz students,btohqsg
Anybody wanna to join me in debate.. feel free,btohqsg
Xmm says i add too much soy sauce... But i find this the balance😂,btohqsg
Bingo .. you are right .. alot people maybe donno about this ..,btohqsg
Ok lai.. finally I got time to type,btohqsg
No matter what we want in life... It's the real value that matters...,btohqsg
Stocks wise... We r playing just for the anticipation of real value,btohqsg
NAV  possible completion of projects  possible gain of industry (e.g med  oil  tech)  seasonal gain...,btohqsg
Gloves Or that pack of condom u have in the drawer...both r rubber.. but diff. Real Value,btohqsg
Every industry needs cash to realise that opportunity to gain  and cash can come from sponsor or bank loan...,btohqsg
For us  fuking peasants... We Bo lui but we want a place to sleep and a bed other than that staircase...So gotta get a bank loan to get that place,btohqsg
And banks... Because of the above  cash is just 'stocks in warehouse' for them to use...And we as peasants... Put cash in banks  as saving.. earning peanuts for interest... Are stocking up their warehouse... While they selling the cash like a 20/30yrs project to earn 50% or higher,btohqsg
But also... Currency real value will always depreciate.. as inflation will always be there  as long as no war occur and world is still progressing,btohqsg
Just a matter of at wat rate is inflation at stage,btohqsg
So in fact... When banks are earning 50% over capital.. but at 30yrs ltr... They are not really earning 50% in real value..,btohqsg
So in real terms  even when ppl pay full cash decades ago and sell now  on the basis of same demand and supply between last time and now  they are not earning,btohqsg
This can be seen in Malaysia properties.. where property holders don't earn that much as Malaysia economy still jialat after decades,btohqsg
Meanwhile in sg  property price go up as a whole... U sell and u buy again... Can't really realise your gains... Unless u downgrade  which some did..  tats partial realising gains,btohqsg
Unless u sell your sg property and go Malaysia be tycoon.. tats full realising gains...   As Malaysia properties can only go constant.. for now,btohqsg
That's all from me... Floor is open....,btohqsg
Lai.. anybody want start debate... I very long no debate le,btohqsg
I no smart guy but like Econs..,btohqsg
Boring if I typing alone here ah,btohqsg
So actually ah... Since centuries ago... Banks are the most huat job/industryLast time China got bank note (银票） now we got bank books...,btohqsg

ASL insiders recently converted quite a chunk of $0.060 warrants amounting to $millions of their own money into the company.Whenever insiders willing to put own money into their company  it’s always good to put more attention to them since they are risking more money  you can expect them to hustle harder too  IMO.TA  yesterday T4/T5 contra players  did not lose and price is now above the downtrend pressure line.ASL should be a good longer term pick  especially for those who can hold. The potential is there and the industry they are in is doing well oversell.Currently  it is trading cheaper than what the insiders have paid for the conversion.Added more $0.058 yesterday too at close.
