all cars if lowered nice liao,btohqsg
but i wondering  eurocars always have those active suspension stuff,btohqsg
will those sensors keep showing error or what,btohqsg
Super cars den will have that,btohqsg
normal eurocars will also have one,btohqsg
like sports mode then your dampers harder,btohqsg
Change le den no more liao,btohqsg
there are coils that are compatible w the active damping,btohqsg
but most of it will have to give it up,btohqsg
but don't know  the car will display error? or need to change do some programming to the car to remove the error,btohqsg
Not sure also..My guess is if to forgo the coil over den you lose the programming and stick to the aftermarket coil..Give and take lo,btohqsg
as long as dont keep display warnings can liao ba,btohqsg
Have to off that from settings,btohqsg
Can off via settings if not den through the master programmer,btohqsg
Lowering springs if I not wrong,btohqsg
then the active dampers still there,btohqsg
Den I can change to lowering spring,btohqsg
But it will probably damage your dampers,btohqsg
they may have a plug to fool the active damper sensor that it's still there.,btohqsg
Hmm okie..nvm I will do up more research on this 😊,btohqsg
is your wheel gap currently high?,btohqsg
about 3 finger gaptbh my car already vry low,btohqsg
open door it just nice to clear the kerb if lower i cant park near the kerb,btohqsg
it will hit or door will get stuck,btohqsg
there will be certain carparks you can't go,btohqsg
mine if i go leisure park  sure to scrape  also fullerton hotel exit,btohqsg
one fullerton still ok  but fullerton i cannot,btohqsg
my clearance is far so goodable to clear most of the carpark,btohqsg
also the shell carwash at geylang i cannot,btohqsg
mine about 1 half to 2,btohqsg
mx5 is a fun car to drive,btohqsg
When i running 16 inch i was scraping everything,btohqsg
go up HDB slope also scrape,btohqsg
17 looks nice on your car bro,btohqsg
now dont scrape most of the things,btohqsg
but he probably get more performance on the 16,btohqsg
like maybe 1 out of 10 humps I'll scrape,btohqsg
i can probably buy bigger profile 16inch tyres la,btohqsg
that new exhaust won't look so new,btohqsg
i might lower might a little bit more  maybe half finger,btohqsg
unless i install my 4 point bar again,btohqsg
now you already cant go some of the carpark,btohqsg
yeah but i saw old photos of my car when it was lower,btohqsg
later you lower more...you cant go anywhere bro,btohqsg
if i install the bar again  for sure i can't go lower,btohqsg
but will make the chassis a bit stiffer,btohqsg
4 point bar should be able to stiffen your car chassis,btohqsg
but it hit a couple of humps then started rattling so i took it out,btohqsg
better dont install 4 point bar bro..your car is already vry stable in corner / high speed corner,btohqsg
if too stiff passenger and driver wont be able to enjoy long drive,btohqsg
I think if nv track dont do ba,btohqsg
daily might have feel the diff,btohqsg
if track alr feel need then do. Might not even need also,btohqsg
might not even feel the diff*,btohqsg
lowering can but make sure you check on and pair with the right spring rate.  too soft  the stroke will not be enough or will increase the stress on the absorber thereby reducing the lifespan of your absorber.  If you have edc you can purchase an add on/plug in module for edc delete  or code it out also possible on quite a few cars.,btohqsg
got 2 different bars at home just sitting in the store,btohqsg
bro why your name so complicated,btohqsg
okie noted and thanks for the advise,btohqsg
"should call you ""anwo the 3rd""",btohqsg
might be an idea to check the pitch of your car  and also distance from ground to the lowest point of your front bumper (assuming you are having mostly front bumper scraps or is it middle?).,btohqsg
most of the car i think will hit front den middle ba,btohqsg
really... cos i feel front is the hardest to clear.. if clear front den middle should be able to clear,btohqsg
The other day i mount kerb at my cousin's house,btohqsg
Mx5 bumper looks like a shark,btohqsg
from what i have seen (and I am no expert nor professional ah)  anything more than 10cm from ground to lowest point in front should be safe,btohqsg
but if you're pitching too much in front  you may want to have more clearance to be safe,btohqsg
you see  it's impossible to scrape the front bumper,btohqsg
my scrapes all in the middle,btohqsg
hmm den you lower the car too much liao thats y scrape middle,btohqsg
yeah roadster are meant to be lower,btohqsg
i thinking of upping size of tyres,btohqsg
download and check Carparks To Avoid before setting out,btohqsg
den handling and look will be nice and pretty,btohqsg
i got a friend  he rather raise all his exhaust hangers then to raise the car,btohqsg
Got a few malls i know alr  i try to avoid,btohqsg
light scratch i can still tahan,btohqsg
got some is dragging the carriage across,btohqsg
go 1 time idw go alr,btohqsg
alot is those old old buildings,btohqsg
next time his boot inside all wood to help him clear,btohqsg
if no car behind ok la,btohqsg
that time i go tanglin shopping center,btohqsg
behind me 1 ford focus RS,btohqsg
u up overall circumference.. car slower + speedo abit buay zhun,btohqsg
my gf got take video but knn my face looks constipated cos very pain,btohqsg
raise to clear  spacers  and play with tyre dimensions to get the best fitment,btohqsg
too high cannot be satisfied la hahah,btohqsg
we'll see la. I'm okay with my fitment now,btohqsg
mine put lowering spring liao still 2finger gap. but can clear most humps,btohqsg
as long as i'm not scraping everything,btohqsg
1 or 2 places got problem i just avoid if i can,btohqsg
hahaha ya i was scraping everything at 1 point,btohqsg
even those small rubber carpark humps,btohqsg
you attack sheares bridge fast going up and coming down without any problems?,btohqsg
the metal ones also u scrape? simi sai.. lol,btohqsg
cannot gain weight also.... will scrape more,btohqsg
then sounds like you just need to navigate humps carefully,btohqsg
the black yellow rubber small small ones,btohqsg
put luggage go changi jialat hahaha,btohqsg
front wheel go down alr bong very loud the chassis,btohqsg
they shd stick to concrete.. the small metal one bump sibei siong,btohqsg
i usually think mx5 is the 2nd or 3rd car in the house,btohqsg
haha go slow also kena ah,btohqsg
in the house yes la. but it's my only car,btohqsg
2 door car i like S2K,btohqsg
that one sian to the max the whole day.  undercarriage really won't be happy long term man,btohqsg
same for me  if bad weather i take my mom's vezel,btohqsg
i was running 1 finger 16 inch,btohqsg
then i raised to 2 finger,btohqsg
then i am at 17 inch 1 finger now,btohqsg
next car see got family or not liao,btohqsg
den alone drive car go meet family,btohqsg
tonight i go tell my wife this idea,btohqsg
my cousin in law when he had the mx5  he drives that  leaves the kid and my cousin in the 2nd car,btohqsg
My argument is always  if some families can survive on motorbikes only,btohqsg
why i cannot survive on MX5 only,btohqsg
hope your wife dont go beat up your 2nd wife (your car) haha,btohqsg
tell her get her own ride,btohqsg
it went well for my cousin in law  but eventually he sold the mx5 and changed to a mini,btohqsg
he restored it fully  but sold because didn't want to see it parked under the sun,btohqsg
I know of someone in the MX5 group  the guy drive mx5  wife drive mini,btohqsg
they used to be car dealers,btohqsg
so know where to get deals,btohqsg
similar story with mine  previous previous owner got it  restored  drove a few years then flipped it.  Owner after that drove half year  sold at a loss to me,btohqsg
dont think now can still earn from selling cars ba,btohqsg
if i sell now  i earn,btohqsg
but i see like stagnant alr,btohqsg
that's cos you buy your car awhile back ma,btohqsg
i bought in june last year,btohqsg
I mean like buying a car now to flip,btohqsg
but to be honest  if you plan to keep all the way  it doesn't matter the value,btohqsg
my fren got MGZS 2bids guarantee so dealer gt 2 chance to whack,btohqsg
i'd be happy if the coe drops all the way down  then give you chance to have another car,btohqsg
i got consider to buy a cheap daily,btohqsg
like attrage or simi also ok,btohqsg
hopefully next few years can find those 5 to 6k depre beater cars,btohqsg
i'd probably have to move to my own place before getting another car,btohqsg
Ytd patched tyre  checked whole tyre no leak alr still pressure low,btohqsg
too many vehicles in my mom's place,btohqsg
if coe 10 yr cycle works.. 2029 lowest coe hahaha,btohqsg
use your car settings and get it to restore your current tyre pressure..Or you can go pump all 4 trye and den use your car settings to restore the current trye pressure den it should ne fine liao,btohqsg
so far 2009 and 2019 juz nice tio,btohqsg
you got any other tyre pressure checker?,btohqsg
you got bring go tyre shop check?,btohqsg
you tilt tilt the valve see got sound or not,btohqsg
check the tyre valve firstif still fail den go dignose your car and made sure all sensor is working correctly,btohqsg
might be faulty senior on main board,btohqsg
i always go about 34 to 35 psi,btohqsg
36 i feel too hard already,btohqsg
Don't over pump not good for your tyre,btohqsg
Always read your tyre psi den pump accordingly,btohqsg
I rather oversteer than understeer :P,btohqsg
On 38psi my car was 5+-6kml,btohqsg
if thats why tyres are cold.. wa warm up liao even higher sia bro,btohqsg
i alws pump when its hot tho,btohqsg
Just take note den have your trye valve check or replace den see how it go,btohqsg
i search 5 series tyre pressure its 32 psi leh,btohqsg
maybe thats why you leaking  tyre buang already lol,btohqsg
What is the tyre pressure for BMW 5 Series?Image result for bmw 535i tyre pressure30-35 PSIAns : The BMW 5 Series tyres have the dimension of 245/45 R18 and the recommended range of pressure for these tyres is 30-35 PSI.According to google,btohqsg
30-35 psi warning come out liao,btohqsg
what tyre you running and your dimensions,btohqsg
anyway got tyre shop girl in here  can ask her what to pump,btohqsg
yeah i think so she driving legacy wagon,btohqsg
Oh i saw her tiktok before,btohqsg
U say tyre girl ik alr,btohqsg
Wooo saw blue m2 just now,btohqsg
Yeah he at shell JB 😂,btohqsg
In jb also can tio spot@Buikia0108,btohqsg
haha yeah ... your fav wagaon,btohqsg
Really Ma. Fit is modifiable jazz is the must follow rule and difficult to Zhng one,btohqsg
max pressure usually 50psi. that's too near max already 😵,btohqsg
You that you reminded me that car can be a claymore anytime,btohqsg
No la tyres burst at ard 200psi mah,btohqsg
Paiseh I MC HAHA just woke up,btohqsg
Cannot find hole tbh can be a lot of things  like some shifu say can be valve  or can be things like the side of the tyre bead have small air leakage,btohqsg
Actually this one for normal compressed air on the high side sia HAHA,btohqsg
Wider tyres (I.e. u upgrade width only 225-> 235 etc) u don’t need to pump until so hard  it’s mostly when you upgrade rims for example 19inch -> 21inch & ur tyre profile becomes v thin then it’s necessary,btohqsg
If u want to ownself DIY check leak  can get those spray bottle fill with soapy water,btohqsg
Then u spray the valve check if got bubbles,btohqsg
Next step if all fails is the shop will dump ur entire tyre + rim in water liao,btohqsg
his car like every other day got something come up,btohqsg
And cfm at 170 the compressed air gna expand like nobody bizniz,btohqsg
i 36psi already feel too hard,btohqsg
34psi i feel like my turning sharper,btohqsg
best part is  even after months i check  the psi never drop.  don't know why,btohqsg
You start engine just now the guy got scared 😂😂😂,btohqsg
No la i mean speed hahahp,btohqsg
