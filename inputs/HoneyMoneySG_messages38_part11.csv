"Decided to join after watching this...assuming my incremental tax bracket is 15%  that means when I top up 8k  I actually save 1.2k...this 1.2k I can also re-invest else where at say  ok  CPF OA rates of 2.5% right? I understand that at the end  I cannot do CPF shielding but over 25 years of topping up 8k... that would mean I have an ""extra"" 25*1.2k which is 30k right?This is to compare against CPF OA  that unable to transfer to RA to earn 4%",btohqsg
this first and foremost entirely depends on your take on CPF LIFE,btohqsg
ok maybe 25 is not a good number  because 25*8 = 200k  that will exceed the FRS for sure  isn't the opportunity cost more of  save 1.2k today vs being able to shield 8k at 4% in later years?i.e 1.2k savings today  unable to shield 8k at 4% in later years but still can get 2.5%,btohqsg
