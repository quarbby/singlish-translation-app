dcs flex quite good  but need to use physical card,btohqsg
I heard someone suggested Maybank Family & Friends  but given the minimum spend of $800  Is it still a worthwhile pairing?If one already has Citi rewards+amaze DBS woman‚Äôs ?,btohqsg
Min spend too high for me,btohqsg
Yup DCS is the next best alternative otherwise UOB ladies will be another with no min spend,btohqsg
The short answer is to wait for cpf to announce the BHS for 2025. Should be out anytime. It's usually announced in early dec,btohqsg

can I ask you how does insta points works ?,btohqsg
1. You will not hit BHS on 1 Jan because the interest will be transferred to SA/OA (depends if SA hit FRS yet). You can top up the difference (BHS 2025 minus BHS 2024).2. Monthly contribution will go to SA/OA (depends if SA hit FRS yet).,btohqsg
Should be able to get. Has the transaction posted?,btohqsg
ya posted already with the full amount  not $0.10 pending. I‚Äôll monitor over the next few days,btohqsg
anyone knows any card that doesn't exclude MCC 8299 (education)?,btohqsg

Unlikely - I think it‚Äôs in their exclusion list in the T&C,btohqsg

Would you volunteer top up cpf or invest the money to high interest saving account ?Gonna purchase resale HDB next year 2025,btohqsg
You probably need the cash to be liquid  and you can beat 2.5% p.a. with a lot of bank accounts.,btohqsg
Just came back from my trip and saw this too in my mail box.. and then Maybank called me offering 2.88% PA.. hahhaah,btohqsg

EGA Bonus interest for September in üòä,btohqsg
top up CPF will go to SA if you are below 55 and the money cannot be used to purchase HDB.if you need the money next year  you need to invest it somewhere else,btohqsg

Hello  is SCB Smart Card a good cashback card option if only used for public transport? Thank you,btohqsg
not really. it has been nerfed recently,btohqsg
imo  its a decent card for overseas spend. Quarterly based cashback mechanics within required categories so local spends are too tricky for me,btohqsg
