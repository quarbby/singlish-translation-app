Hiiii guys  I need some suggestion for Japanese cars  basically Toyota vs Lexus .Does Lexus has premier part and build quality than Toyota ??,btohqsg
Lexus is the luxury arm of Toyota. Any specific models you're comparing?,btohqsg
I’m looking at Lexus IS300H luxury vs Toyota Camry elegance . Just wondering I’m a paying the premium for its brand   or am I paying a premium for a better quality of its parts and build and experience ?,btohqsg
Chassis wise I not sure but Lexus and Toyota are known to use the TNGA across Brands. An example is the Camry. It’s the same chassis as the ES250 or ES300h. I’m not sure what’s the equivalent for the Toyota TNGA platform for the IS. Maybe Corolla?You are paying a premium in terms of the make and quality compared to Toyota and certain equipment differences. Eg. Memory seats available for Lexus IS300h but not for Camry elegance.Some other differences would be like the infotainment system quality  upholstery  the trims  tyres used  etc. engine wise probably both are comparable to some extent.,btohqsg

At least from my peers’ feedback who drove Lexus  not much complaints for their cars. You are aft all buying the reliability of Toyota in a way.,btohqsg
If you can afford the Lexus  go for it.,btohqsg
But frankly IS300h and Camry in terms of size they are not the same. Camry and ES300 would be more similar. Hope this helps!,btohqsg
Extremely valuable feedback for me for selecting my first car in my life,btohqsg
No problem. Happy to provide this info. If you are looking for an ES now is a good time since it’s face lifted. If not the NX if you would like an SUV.,btohqsg
Always found the UX a bit small and RX a bit too big. NX would be a good balance.,btohqsg
NX really impressive . I would probably go for either IS or ES… ES abit pricy though….,btohqsg
Ya it is. At least this time the FL model they got rid of the touchpad for the infotainment. IS good for a daily driver but a bit small at the back.,btohqsg
ES price about the same as the brand new NX350… crazy …. Hard to afford .. unless they got promo hahaha 🤣,btohqsg
In fact I think Toyota harrier luxury specs about the same as the ES. Just some outdated infotainment system,btohqsg
Ya actually Harrier is also not a bad choice too.,btohqsg
I personally don’t mind the interface too much so as long there is apple CarPlay or android auto.,btohqsg

Hey just enquiring I'm currently looking to buy a new car but is ok to buy a new diesel car now?,btohqsg
Can i still drive diesel car after 2025 when the government stop continuing diesel cars on the road?,btohqsg
You should be able to. So far policy is that they will take 20 years as a hard cap for combustion engines (diesel or petrol) at 2040 to be phased out. So meanwhile if you get it now  you should be able to drive it till 2032 max before you have to scrap it by 2040 anyway.Just that 2025 onwards cannot buy new diesel cars alr. Existing ones unless they announce incentives or what not to scrap them  it should still be able to be used provided it meets the emissions standard and requirements.,btohqsg
But maybe don’t get diesel. So you don’t need to think about this problem at all. Just get petrol hybrid or EV.,btohqsg

post a question on electric vehicle readiness for singapore  what are everyone's opinion on getting a electric car in 2022 ?My take is :1. given that our charging network still not 100% ready  not every HDB carpark has charging point2. charging takes sooo long4. range anxiety5. visibility of gov's relief scheme in the near future is not clear6. for ppl staying at HDB suppose 80% of the population / or even condos may struggle  so not a best time to get it now...,btohqsg

can save petrol mah. somemore now petrol prices increasing also,btohqsg
Mild hybrid is diff from prius hybrid isn't it?,btohqsg
Say real one.. never save until where also.Plus everytime coming to a stop the engine cuts off and it will start again when u coming to a full stop and releasing ur brake pedal a little. its super irritating,btohqsg
Coe high   petrol high   ev road tax so ex . Wonder what car is worth buying now,btohqsg
Yea its different. Prius is full hybrid.Mild hybrid suppose to be like inbetween  but the hybrid doesnt power ur drivetrain,btohqsg
This one next time also COE,btohqsg
The mild hybrid only good for start stop and some small electronics powering. Doenst really contribute significantly to fuel economy,btohqsg
Yes super agree. And doesnt work in singapore.. i cant even let the car coast for long distance.. a little only i need to brake and then accelerate already.,btohqsg
A180 n A200 is a fun drive but engine is using other brand. A3 mild hybrid I actually like it . Power n speed both have bit salesman very niao with package. 320i is actually a better choice. BMW r generally more generous with their package.,btohqsg
A3 mild hybrid is same as my current golf   leon and octavia. Same engine.I didnt like e a3 mild hybrid cos of its driving dynamics,btohqsg
"Sound like a marketing tactics to just ride on the ""hybrid"" hype.",btohqsg
Waaa didn't knew that Mercedes Benz start to use other engine brand or design. They are usually knew for their german engine engineering,btohqsg
It does save some fuel  like 0.3L per km.,btohqsg

We can assure you that our reviews are not biased. We say it as it is,btohqsg
For used car reviews  that's kind of tricky. What if we identify a problem with the used car?But we'll certainly take your feedback into consideration and let Julian and Jon know.,btohqsg
only 600+ members here la but can ask if there is a particular model you are thinking of.. i pm my review to one here,btohqsg
It's only going to grow bigger. Big plans!,btohqsg
Also I was thinking if the car reviews can be comparing cars in each class rather than individual cars so that people can know what choices are available rather than just knowing mostly about the particular car. I think it would be more useful as in one video people can know about the best few cars in the segment rather than just one individual car,btohqsg

Yeah. That would make a sound choice for car buyers. Like me i wanna know like example a golf  what cars are in the same range (price  space  power at least)And then a comparison on whats better so we can make a better choice in our future selection.Its gonna be tough as u guys will need to do more homework and also review them together or edit it together,btohqsg
"Yes. Some of our used car dealers pick up the warranty  and some don't. That's why you see some listings with ""This car is covered under sgCarMart Warranty"".",btohqsg

Hi all. Not sure if I can ask this here but if I’m buying a used car from a dealer (gst registered)  the gst should already be included in the car price right?,btohqsg
Thx for the reply! Coz dealer wants me to pay gst and when questioned  he says his car price not inclusive of gst. But he’s willing to half-half the gst with me and absorb a lil bit more.,btohqsg
https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/basics-of-gst/invoicing-price-display-and-record-keeping/displaying-and-quoting-prices#:~:text=GST%2Dregistered%20businesses%20must%20display as%20the%20GST%2Dexclusive%20price. GST-registered businesses must display and quote prices inclusive of GST. If both GST-inclusive and GST-exclusive prices are displayed  the GST-inclusive price must be displayed at least as prominently as the GST-exclusive price.,btohqsg
not quoting inclusive GST is 100% unethical and possibly illegal. To me  he is just trying to squeeze more money from you. If I was you  immediate blacklist and go patronise someone else,btohqsg
Thank you so much sir  much appreciated 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Also  admin fee is another BS right? 😂,btohqsg
pretty much. Anything 'extra' after price agreed is immediate red flag and if its me i walk away,btohqsg
Which dealer gave that BS on the gst?,btohqsg
i have no problem with admin fee if its pre-agreed before setting final price,btohqsg
its those last minute additions i have problem with. they use all sorts of names for these BS charges,btohqsg
To be fair  it wasn’t really last minute additions. We were still in the midst of negotiations,btohqsg
Normally when negotiating the price  I will upfront tell him to tell I want the all in price. Whatever gst  admin fee you can charge whatever you want  just tell me the all in price.,btohqsg
If car price is 50k  I expect 50k inclusive of whatever fee you want to charge. Maybe car $1k  admin 49k.,btohqsg
Yea  guess the negotiations continue hahaha,btohqsg
Appreciate all the replies here  thx all!,btohqsg
Ask to waive the admin fee. Sounds bullshit,btohqsg
Common for dealers to say admin fee lah.. haha. Up to u they deserve it or not nia.,btohqsg
This admin fee basically goes directly into their pocket right lol,btohqsg

My thought are ... Singapore still got many rich people,btohqsg
I guess the only way price went it is when supply is getting lower and lower. Aging population would also meant there is more demand for car. I personally bought my car as part of the plan to allow easier travel for my aging mum who have difficulties in walking distances like 400m.And we are still debating on free transportation at the parliament for senior citizens and the physically challenged group of folks.,btohqsg
Iswaran’s points on increased costs if we provide free for disabled and seniors are quite valid. 300-400m is not small change. But I’m sure we can come to a middle ground  like free only for certain hours  this might work and wouldn’t burden the commuters too much as well.Those who can pay more should pay more to help the less privileged. At least in my opinion.,btohqsg

I doubt it is that high to be honest. It was proposed that the free rides for disabled and seniors are during off peaks hours. These are the times where the buses and train would have some free capacity. Even if there is increase in cost  it shouldn't be that much since the buses and trains are plying the route already.,btohqsg
That’s only aft Iswaran countered with the actual cost if it’s implemented for full day,btohqsg
Not practical for full day implementation now. As we walk out of Covid  the trains and peak bus routes gonna be packed anyways. You can't really be expecting elderly to squeeze thru the hoards of Human crowd. Even PIW will find themselves difficulties in navigating around.So I am still focusing in the idea for free transport for elderly and PIW during off peak hours. Pretty much the same idea where we gave discount COE for red plate cars. But now with the current COE prices  red plate provide much incentive to adopt....,btohqsg
I not saying that I don’t support the idea of free transport during off peak hours  provided we can find the funding from some source. Either pass this cost to consumers  or don’t implement.On that topic of OPC  I also feel this system is obsolete   and should be improved. A pay per use system can be considered.,btohqsg

$2.00/litre is the Max we should be paying for petrol. If our neighbouring country can subsidise and not tax their citizens. It is possible it can be managed here too. Its just Greed plain and simple profiteering,btohqsg
EV takes a long time to charge if you are out of your home based charger. Also if you are low on charge you really need to search for a charger nearby and if its occupied  you would have to wait a long time for the owner to drive away. If you're in Malaysia its as good as not finding one as its not easily available everywhere.,btohqsg
I drove for 3 month   10% to 80 % is only 20 minute   but I am using home charger most of the time   actually got ppl going Malaysia already with ev   but to me ev is perfect in Singapore due to lot of city driving and save alot of petrol and no maintenance and lastly good price for cat a coe,btohqsg
That's Good. For me I need a little bit more convincing and of course a fast charger  easily available everywhere before  even considering switching over. Ha. Ha..😜,btohqsg
Yeah just sharing   as ev for me is too good in terms of   pricing   performance   cost   convenience  it been 3 month I visit a petrol kiosk or need to go charge   and no maintenance like engine oil and such,btohqsg

hey was reading about road tax in sg  could anyone help to explain why its higher for EVS? im not too aware bout this,btohqsg
Is due to the additional tax due to petrol saving,btohqsg
Becoz they got nothing to tax for petrol excise. Yes.,btohqsg
Becoz of the flat fee component which is to replace fuel excise duties,btohqsg
9% lol... Wonder what's the basis the comparison is made,btohqsg
No. BlueSG has artificial IC engine noise to warn pedestrians. EVs mostly silent but many make an artificial noise at slow speeds like in carparks.,btohqsg

yep…I encountered a lorry that took a shortcut before🙃,btohqsg
Yea esp at bishan junction 8 carpark. Those coming up from b2 always shortcut n go against the one direction traffic instead of going one round,btohqsg
My opinion la  if government really wants to encourage adoption of EV  a seperated COE should be introduced. (Basic electric cars similar to BlueSG and luxury electric vehicle)Singapore isn't a big city  you technically do not need a sophisticated long range EV so long the charging infrastructure is there,btohqsg
The charging time is too long,btohqsg
Compared to going to petrol station to pump,btohqsg
U will see a lot of hoarders at Hdb charging point,btohqsg
Maybe should have chargers at MSCP washing bays too. Charge as we wash n wax. 😁. No time wasted. 😁😁,btohqsg
Use removable battery pack… pay for fully charged pack and drive off,btohqsg
just convert majority of season parking bays to have charging points,btohqsg
We have weatherproof power sockets for buildings so I believe it can be done for cars too. 😁😁,btohqsg
after that you can apply for season parking for EV,btohqsg
Hope they come out with wireless charging… just like how they charge us for erp,btohqsg
wireless charging lane on the road  charge as you drive,btohqsg
Solar charging… then no need to pay,btohqsg
I will buy ev  if they have solar charging,btohqsg
China had this. Just drive to the station n it will swop ur batteries. Even for electric bikes  just swop the fully charged batteries,btohqsg
So far only I've heard nio has been implementing this throughout china,btohqsg
But first we need more ev choices haha,btohqsg
Ya nio only  if this is implemented across all e ev den i sure buy sia.I find charging is such a hassle now.Imagine ppl charging there 30mins so i have to wait 30min for my turn and another 30min to charge?,btohqsg
If everyone is ev in e petrol stn  hw long we gonna wait sia.. if nearby dont have other chargers,btohqsg

I agree  not much choices for 7 seater EVs at the moment... Only say the BYD van like 7 seater 😅,btohqsg
Agreed. The current scheme for EV adoption is not even enticing enough for us to abandon petroleum cars . In fact  it seems more so they want us to give up on cars and take public transport for good.,btohqsg
Wonder if there’s any trial ev for one mth to try. Like to experience the ownershipOf ev and see whether its worth the change,btohqsg
There are some PIs offering rental of EVs up to 3 days. Those should be a good litmus test for patterns and lifestyle change to be expected.,btohqsg

Just nice as we are talking about EVs 😂,btohqsg
But for EV  my concern is still on the availability of the charging port,btohqsg
Is ioniq5 any better for its price,btohqsg
does tesla 3 now requre cat a coe>,btohqsg
I feel ioniq 5 is one of the best EVs available out there as it has the perfect blend of luxury and versatility with sufficient range,btohqsg
Cat B becoz the Kw is 237KW.,btohqsg
basic single motor tesla 3 is 110 kwh,btohqsg
i think tesla 3 is best,btohqsg
Not correct. The single motor is SR+.239kW. The 50kwH is your battery size.,btohqsg
The 239kW is referring to power output. That’s how it is used to determine your cat.,btohqsg
what is the power output of the most basic one,btohqsg
239kW. The performance is 377 kW with dual motor. Both are Cat B.,btohqsg
then the cat A 110 kwh is small is to help the nissan leaf type of cars,btohqsg
if not for coe so high  tesla 3 is really the best,btohqsg
Yes. Only 5 qualify for Cat AIoniq sedan (not the Ioniq 5)Kona Short rangeMG ZSNissan LeafKia Niro Short Range,btohqsg
All the power are below 110 Kw as their battery size is Less than 50kwH,btohqsg
Renault Zoe not sure. Don’t think it’s available.,btohqsg
I rmb seeing an article on 5 EVs that qualify for cat A recently  maybe sgcarmart site,btohqsg
Those 5 yes. Listed above.Ioniq sedan (not the Ioniq 5)Kona Short rangeMG ZSNissan LeafKia Niro Short Range,btohqsg
Even the entry level EQA from Mercedes’   very slow alr also 170 kW,btohqsg
Unfortunately at least 80% of EVs are still in Cat B,btohqsg
Will Cat B COE drop anytime soon?,btohqsg
Realised it’s not the first time it went up close to 100k,btohqsg
Been observing  unlikely so  if there’s a fast transition to EVs  orders for them will go up. Less scrapping of old CoEs.,btohqsg
Problem is will cat a go up further if people decide to switch to cat a evs?,btohqsg
2013 was the period when there’s a lot of Uber/Grab fleet cars. Some Cat A and B. But by 2023 those cars have to scrap as they are not allowed to be used for PHV as the lifespan for PHVs must be max 7 years.,btohqsg
So 2023 will be bad cos phv will need to renew coes?,btohqsg
Good point also. Again  if less scrapping  likely it’ll stay at that range or slighly higher. I not sure if there will be an immediate jump in demand for those EVs as honestly the range is still nothing to be impressed about.,btohqsg
Doubt private hire cars will actually be EVs😂,btohqsg
Could be too. Depending on the fleet size but honestly there are new cars registered for PHVs in the past 1-2 years alr  so it shouldn’t suddenly increase the PHV population too much at least in my opinion.,btohqsg
Can you imagine charging more than once a day,btohqsg
Their average range is 300+ per day. So in fact It’s every day.,btohqsg
N Charging take more than 40 mins even for DC charging?,btohqsg
And if no DC access = have to wait for 7-8 hours for 0-100,btohqsg
For low distance users it is okay,btohqsg
Depending on the battery tech and the DC charge rate,btohqsg
Maybe 15 mins DC charging and more availablity of charging pts,btohqsg
But ev road tax oso more ex,btohqsg
Yeah I did some quick calcs also.Assume:Daily minimum commute is 60km just from work to home. Some days I may clock 100 depending on the schedule but let’s average 80km per day.Weekly is about 560km.If I use an EV with 300km range I’ll have to charge every 4 days. About 25 per charge  so it’s about 100bucks per month. Or slighly more.,btohqsg
Ya so use 25 per charge and frequency of charging as your reference point against petrol cost. So you can then make a decision whether EV running cost vs petrol running cost is more. Personally I feel as of now  EV still is more expensive for long commuting.,btohqsg
But if Ev become common and mass usage,btohqsg
The cost of charging may oso go up in future,btohqsg
Indeed  so it could be more than 100 per month in the future.As of now  some cars can let you charge for free with the right facilities like Shell Recharge for 3 years if you buy a BMW EV  or Tesla superchargers if you get a Tesla.Just limited by locations and all. So I feel spending time to analyse which is best for you is prudent.,btohqsg
The SP survey placed by SGCM admins here also asked about how much premium will you pay to charge at:1. Town areas2. Peak hours3. Popular places.It gives an idea for us as consumers how much we are willing to pay as a whole to have that convenience and in terms help in their planning for charger deployment,btohqsg
Good to do that survey to help them out,btohqsg
A rookie question  do people often buy cars with down payment? Or do people convert everything to installments,btohqsg
Rates for a 100% instalment can kill,btohqsg
And also I’m not sure if dealers offer these kind of schemes too,btohqsg
what is the fastest charging time for tesla 3 now,btohqsg
Loans provided by local banks are to follow the MAS ruling of having buyers to pay 30-40% of the listed price for DP  at a lowered interests as compared to what most dealers would usually extend to buyers for their inhouse loan schemes. In house loans usually can loan more to buyers they dont have to follow MAS' guidelines  at a higher interest rates (a caveat).The 30-40% guideline is MAS' way of preventing ppl getting debt defaults. See what you prioritise in life when you are buying a ride.THis is a simplified explanation. Can find out more here:https://www.valuechampion.sg/car-loan-analysis-should-you-get-financing-bank-or-auto-dealer,btohqsg
There are full loan with 0% downpayment schemes available  but i wouldnt recommended taking such approach as the risk and financial Burden is extremely High. What if   in the event you lose your job  etc,btohqsg
do you really need a car in singapore? if you are not traveling to malaysia often  then a car is really not needed,btohqsg
because it is insane to pay such high price here,btohqsg
We dont need per se  but it’s an convenience.Imagine if u have family  kids  groceries etc. Having your own car is definitely more convenient than taking grab/renting. But in terms of cost  renting might be cheaper for short term usage,btohqsg
a convenience at such high costs? not wise.,btohqsg
It's so common for ppl to take up $0 downpayment  raking up 1k-1.5k installment per month.Nothing new now.,btohqsg
Wise or not really depends on how individual look at it.Just like eating out - caifan vs restaurant/cafe. Same thing you get to fill your stomach.,btohqsg
if you do very well financially  then i say ok get it. because such high costs dont dent your wallet. but if you must save years just to own one  then i think it is simply not wise for the sake of wanting to own it. singapore has made it clear to avoid car ownership. with the convenice of public transport ,btohqsg
Even with downpayment  new cars from AD now also will land you a > 1k instalment/mth,btohqsg
Of cause one need time to save. If not  100k drop from the sky?,btohqsg
Sounds like owning a vehicle is not for you. Perhaps you can try renting and see how it works out for you financially,btohqsg
if you dont have money dont buy car.,btohqsg
if you earn say 2500 a month dont buy a car,btohqsg
If one is not willing to part with 2k/mth then dont bother looking into car ownership,btohqsg
that is because i got to use it to drive to malaysia and back. but in much of singapore i use public transport,btohqsg
Yea. Form of transport across the causeway - a car would definitely save u time and hassle,btohqsg
that is what i said. if you need to use it to travel to malaysia often then yeah. but if you spend most time in singapore a public transport is good enough.,btohqsg
unless you make like 10K a month salary. yes 2k a month wont dent you,btohqsg
Personally as a new owner now  I find that keeping running cost < 1.5k which I’m doing now  is still relatively ok. My spouse is helping with some of the yearly stuff like insurance and season parking and servicing  so that helps a bit.,btohqsg
If u always travel empty handed  no baggage etc then yes,btohqsg
I rather down more than to pay more on interest.Car loan 500Season 100Petrol 200Insurance 200Misc 100,btohqsg
got to plan different shopping habits.,btohqsg
Try travelling in peak hour with a baby stroller  huge backpack etc.,btohqsg
Petrol 200? Insurance 200? So cheap ah,btohqsg
haha whould would quote you 200 for insurance,btohqsg
One full tank already > $120,btohqsg
That means u r under utilize and u dont need a car,btohqsg
Same but my mileage more than my bike,btohqsg
when you dont use it often  it is expensive to own a car,btohqsg
My bike 3yr old less than 13k km. Lol,btohqsg
for me i buy used car. i dont want to lose a lot of money on new cars,btohqsg
It's ok when one is comfortable,btohqsg
Whatever that rocks your boat. Haha,btohqsg
every month i do average of 3000+ km,btohqsg
Old or new  slow or fast. End of day  the person happy can liao,btohqsg
Life so stressful liao  got money cannot enjoy also pointless,btohqsg
si fiat 500 electric available in singapore? this should be good,btohqsg
Have to prob save for the 40% down payment,btohqsg
Then the monthly burden won’t be that bad,btohqsg
Public transport’s fine and pretty good tbh,btohqsg
But sometimes just can’t beat the convenience of owning a car,btohqsg
Everywhere’s so interconnected these days with new train lines and all that,btohqsg

I rather sleep and wake up later lol.,btohqsg
when i go to jewel  i usually would take mrt there. why? parking is too expenisve for many hours.,btohqsg
so i leave the car at home,btohqsg
Haha. Try driving to cbd for parking for 1mth.Can pay your monthly instalment,btohqsg
exactly. that is why i say do not own a car in singapore. it is a lot cheaper and also convenient with public transport,btohqsg
i wont even drive to park in cbd,btohqsg
sometimes i would park my car free in RWS,btohqsg

Heavy  powerful motor even for single motor. Very Volvo like and easy to operate the infotainment. Loved the drive during the test drive. The staff there was also helpful in explaining what’s better in Polestar 2 compared to Tesla M3.,btohqsg
Haha  have u seen how many bugs on that tablet,btohqsg
So is it more like a car than a electronic car feel? I still prefer the car car kind of car.Tesla interior is crappy build and dont have the all the car-like clusters lol,btohqsg
It feels like a Volvo for sure. But it is a bit small and cocooned in when I first sat in it for driver seat. The back seat is not the biggest but functional.,btohqsg
Ah. Not spacious enough? Seems like a huge crossover on the outside,btohqsg
