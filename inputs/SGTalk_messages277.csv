depends on whether you trust the driver  sometimes i feel being passenger can be more tiring than driving,btohqsg

I went alishan before n had a homestay  was awesome,btohqsg
ohh ken ting the market nubbad but there everything close damn early  only the night market got things to do,btohqsg
More tiring for the driver if the passenger talk non stop,btohqsg
alishan is nice but the only interesting thing to do is 4.30am go up the mountain take pic,btohqsg
Normally night market open till quite late.. shops closed early,btohqsg
Not true.. the driver will sleepy lor if passenger stops talking 🤣,btohqsg
night is eat and drink! 😂,btohqsg
yeah but taiwan and taichung at least still can walk and shop  kenting legit everything close,btohqsg
I hate people who eats in my car.. or those mainly enjoy sleeping.. i rather drive solo..,btohqsg
I usually go sunset. Sunrise I can't wake up,btohqsg
yes that is literally the only thing to do in alishan,btohqsg
Go kenting probably go there enjoy the sea view,btohqsg
I’ll prepare masking tape. Or maybe a bottle of Pong Pong juice.,btohqsg

My driver almost dozed off cause I stopped taking 😅,btohqsg
Ya uh.. i cmi too.. whoever eats in my car that fellow is gonna go down in the middle of the expressway,btohqsg
10 days then should try to have 2-3 stops ba  10 days in kenting you will be bored to death hahahaha,btohqsg
Ya gonna go other places too. Just wanna experience the view nia,btohqsg

Not sure. Argentina like no stamina liao😂,btohqsg
France keep sub players. Argentina sub lesser players,btohqsg
Yeah. France now very fast and quick,btohqsg
First half France really can go home,btohqsg

Seems like they hanging on till penalties,btohqsg
