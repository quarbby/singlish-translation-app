Without a degree doesn't mean that you will fail in your career  just that it limits your career choice and its advancement path. For example  in corporate world  degree is almost a mandatory requirement to climp up the corporate ladder,btohqsg
I was looking at the uob evol credit card terms and conditions and it excludes nets. I'm wondering if that is referring to transactions that have NET at the front in my credit card statement? If not  what does the nets exclusion mean?,btohqsg
no worries  it is just standard clause to exclude using the card for NETS payment instead of VISA. Having NET in transaction description not under this exclusion.,btohqsg
I thought u can only use nets on debit cards  its possible to use nets on a credit card?,btohqsg
can  for credit cards that are linked to the bank and with NETS logo behind. Not sure if EVOL can be used for NETS transactions  this is just standard exclusion.,btohqsg
New learning for Evol: Do not use UOB Evol card for foreign currency transactions. It's not counted towards the 600 min spend. Missed my last month's cashback due to buying the rm30 ktm train ticket üòÇ,btohqsg
hm so strange  should be counted so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg
I dunno... I called UOB  the agent scanned through my transactions (total 602sgd)  and said this foreign currency transaction is the only one not counted. Guess I am spending the 600 too close too... Another lesson learned. üòî,btohqsg
probably mcc excluded in this case,btohqsg
Icic. But he did mentioned foreign currency to me.,btohqsg
Hi guys  for uob one account Giro - hdb car park payment consider?Any other giro ideas?Sorry if this qns been ask before üòÖ,btohqsg
Anyone use Evol at overseas before to confirm?,btohqsg
Giro idea: Iras income tax  Iras property tax  UOB cc payment  other cc payment  starhub.,btohqsg
Maybe is bcos of railway/gov mcc? My Agoda online in USD counted for EVOL.,btohqsg
Good to know... Thanks for the info.,btohqsg
May i know buy capita voucher using app consider eligible spend or exclude?,btohqsg
It's consider top up. Not eligible for cashback  when I spend this via HSBC revol. Called to confirm.,btohqsg
My spending in japan also counted  maybe is your mcc excluded. Not due to foreign currency,btohqsg
Where did you buy n pay your KTM ticket?,btohqsg
It shall include. Mcc code shall be 4112. Can you try to use DBS digibot to check its mcc code.,btohqsg
Now still can buy ntuc voucher for minimum spend?,btohqsg
EVOL can. Most SG issued credit cards have NETS. Anyway the back of the card will have the NETS logo to indicate that,btohqsg
I spend 600+ rm and it was counted for evol,btohqsg
Ahh ok I was not aware that u could use nets on a credit card  have always assumed it's a debit card only thing.,btohqsg
I will always suggest against using NETS if visa/mc payment is available even for debit card with their cute little cashback,btohqsg
yea I've never used nets be it debit or credit card üòÇ,btohqsg
Hence my lack of awareness that it exists for credit cards,btohqsg
After the first 1k spend  a wallet option may be better if we track the fx and convert it,btohqsg
All transactions are my usual ones except 1 & 2. Uob agent thinks it was #1 - foreign currency not counted. #2 - payment for pilates class.,btohqsg
I have requested for appeal as I have few more transactions not counted in Jul 29-31 (initially planned for Aug üòÜ). Guess it should be okay. Was just curious abt this foreign currency thingie...,btohqsg
Wow you must be really lucky then. Assuming the rates are retrieved at the same exact timing (down to the minute)  you got the rare better rate with Amaze. üëçüèª Nonetheless  if you have CRMC  you should always pair it with Amaze for these spendings.,btohqsg
What is your statements date? 31 Jul?,btohqsg
@weionmywayShouldn‚Äôt your Jul cashback only will be credited by end of Aug?The amount you saw on 31 Jul is for your Jun cashback.Go n check your Jun transactions. Likely it is your Jun qualified transactions did not meet minimum $600.,btohqsg
Either one might have been processed offline or counted as computer services (excluded MCC).,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ Ai... Guess I need to dig more about how to use the Evol card better. I missed it continously by 2 months (May and June) üòÖ will track better. I knew what I missed accidentally in June  but didn't aware abt May. Thanks all for the info! üòÑüòÑ,btohqsg
You can use your parents' cpf OA to pay for your education. Cpf will inform you when pay back starts. That would include interest as well Bank offer student loan too. Make sure you're comfortable before you sign. I'd take the offer and not look back. My best wishes!!,btohqsg
My view is while you are still young n have the passion n energy to study  go n get the degree if the degree can help to get higher pay after you graduate.Once you grow older  hard for you stay focus n have energy to continue to pursue the degree. This means even if you are financially capable to study a degree in the future  you may not have the energy to do it anymore.$13.5k + $2k is per year or all the tuition fee to get the degree? If it is for the whole degree  it is relatively cheap. You will understand this after you have graduated  start working n progress in your career.,btohqsg
Treat having a degree as a fallback in case you do not have the aptitude to earn a living thru entrepreneurship or trading. Ask yourself truly if you have what it takes to go through these two routes.,btohqsg
Ah I see. There‚Äôs a lot more people siding with getting it degree. Well my end goal is like you guys - financial freedom. The degree I‚Äôm pursuing is in engineering  which has a 4-5k starting salary. The tuition fee is 13.5k per year  so if I pay the monthly installment of 2k for a 45.5k loan W/O interest  it would take me 23 months to pay it all.I would be about 28 by then and I‚Äôm afraid it might be too late to invest due to the risks.But  you are right that a degree is a good thing to fall back on.Just wondering  do you guys think a degree is crucial in Singapore especially in 2023?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve seen people with portfolios of 100k already by 30 and I‚Äôm afraid I might fall behind,btohqsg
Almost everyone has gone through the phase whereby fresh into adult life they think they can get rich quick thru investing and lead an easy life. Until reality hits them hard. The fact is that most investors lose money  and it's not as easy as you think.,btohqsg
Dear community MCC 4812  have a large upcoming transaction of over 10k  can't seem to find a card on heymax that provide reasonable Cashback or miles for the entire amount.3%/3mpdand above for Cashback  milesMay I seek advice from the community here. Thank you!,btohqsg
What is your reasonable amt then? No one can answer that for u.haha,btohqsg
Oh don‚Äôt worry  I don‚Äôt believe in the get rich quick trading scheme. I believe in compounding and dollar cost averaging.,btohqsg
Hello Champs I am about to pay 10K for my son's 1H school fee; if I pay with City pay all  I get to earn 2.2 miles per dollar according to their advertisement. I believe the cost per mile is 1 cent but I have to pay $220 citi pay all fee.Do you think it's worth paying the tuition with Citi Pay all?,btohqsg
If you are planning to work as employee  then a degree is a must.. Each year thousands are graduating with degree. Then you need to ask yourself: Are you able to offer something that is more than those graduates that make you valued at least the same or even more than them? It doesn't mean you need to take the degree now. But it should be something that you aim for. Nowadays even a degree is not enough  you need to top it up with professional certifications that make you earn higher and faster  help you with your side jobs etc.,btohqsg

If by 28 years old you can clear your loan  Go for it. Your income will continue to grow as you gain more experience along your career. You won‚Äôt stuck forever in $4k-$5k. However.

Better not be hoodwinked by tiktok and youtube  most people do not even have 100k by the time they retire let alone by 30!,btohqsg
degree is always great to have  but not mandatory imo,btohqsg
dont worry  every one has their own timeline  one can have 100K by 30 but at 50 only 300K  but another can have 10K by 30 but 1M by 50. so dont worry too much  everyone has their own timeline :),btohqsg
Saw the advert on cimb 3.5%. Seems the best savings so far after hsbc ega nerf?,btohqsg

Don‚Äôt worry  I got a degree and I‚Äôm 29 now with portfolio of 100k and paid off my degree loan. Currently I‚Äôm taking my masters which costs 50k. Education is really important in Singapore to be able to climb the corporate ladder.,btohqsg
old cimb don't have benefit ?,btohqsg
Well done bro can you share how to amass more portfolio now? I wanna start saving.,btohqsg
Tbh the easiest way now is to start saving more and invest in safe etfs/stocks. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently doing. Also as much as possible try to minimise spending and put ur money in those high interest accounts like UOB one which I‚Äôm currently doing. Having 100k in will yield around $420 in interest every month  which also offsets ur spending. But at the same time I guess I‚Äôm quite lucky as I‚Äôm currently still staying with my parents so I don‚Äôt have to deal with any rental expenditures except for the allowance I give them,btohqsg
Yes  deg is essential  esp if u wanna go into technical field like engineering. Its not too late to start investing at 28 and there's no need to benchmark urself to others as long as u r financially prudent and learn to invest rite (low cost  diversified),btohqsg
Tink of a degree as an investment,btohqsg
Good question. I shall endeavor to answer it simply.Usually it will be a good idea to work for maybe 3 years after NS and see whether the field is suitable for you. Some fields do have a different feel working from studying  even with that internship you completed back in Poly. If you‚Äôre confident you can excel in the field and need to delve deeper  then after two years of work or maybe three  you are more likely to incur a smaller study loan  have the work experience that enrich your academic study experience  and value add to your fellow school mates.Also  if you ever consider moving overseas for further opportunities (which you might to even enhance your career)  they look at work experience at a global benchmark. My experience is some countries would rather take five years of technical Poly level work than three years of Uni experience  and all these qualifications up to a age sliding scale‚Ä¶,btohqsg

3.50% p.a. on their incremental fresh funds balance for the first 6 calendar months starting from 1 Aug '23 to 31 Jan '24. if one has low funds on July also can,btohqsg
So what it mean is that if my CIMB July balance is 0 . Once I put in 50k into it I will be able to earn 3.5% interest for the next 6 months? Am I right ?,btohqsg
yes you are right but remember to register. see TnC clause 4d,btohqsg

I thought new TBill is released every two weeks?,btohqsg
I think they reduced it to 3.75% and for every 10k you must deposit 1k of cash so the EIR becomes 3.4+%,btohqsg
Oh I haven‚Äôt done T bills before I missed it the first round will try it again next round and keep a lookout for it since it‚Äôs only earning 2.5% in cpfoa,btohqsg

By the way  is there any way we can buy into Amundi prime USA fund without going through Endowus? - (I don‚Äôt feel safe when it has so much losses) And possible to use cash as well?Can anyone advise on this?,btohqsg
May I know the ssb interests will stop base on your request redeem or the last date of the month when u request redeem?,btohqsg
Hmm why amundi?The reason why people use amundi for endowus instead of lion global is the management fee. 0.3% vs. 0.6%If you're not bound to endowus e.g. cpf oa or srsThen cspx directly on ibkr would be much cheaper,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGany particular reason why you don‚Äôt directly buy into S&P500 on the trading platform but instead go though Amundi Prime USA fund via endowus?,btohqsg
Because cspx management fee is 0.05%,btohqsg
But cspx is not as liquid as spy ?,btohqsg
You may want to google some analysis written by other on CPF OA TBill before making decision. Although you will earn 6 months interest from TBill but you may loss 7-8 months of interest from CPF-OA.,btohqsg
I m trying to automate dca on a monthly basis into 3 funds like Chris  but I find it extremely hard to decide on the 3 funds.,btohqsg

Whats the MCC for engagement wedding band if I want to buy it from Tiffany and co,btohqsg
Im using cpf to invest s&p500  not cash,btohqsg
Do you mean amundi or endowus loss?,btohqsg
And amundi have no dividend because it‚Äôs reinvest  correct?,btohqsg
The losses are ok for a startup company in the first 2 years. Also ur money is with uob kh  so even if endowus goes bust u most probably still can get ur money. Buying snp using cpf or srs only endowus can do. If using cash should buy from elsewhere cuz fees cheaper,btohqsg
I'm sorry can I check with you guy got any guru here know about the 3.5% promotion becausethe full terms and conditions of3.50% p.a. on their incremental fresh funds are very confusing to meI'm an existing customer of CIMB.

Hi  you should have satisfied clause 4c because FastSaver is a savings account.For clause 5c I'm quite convinced you should also have satisfied it since the comparison is 31 July 2023 end day balance. So the deposit of 75k into your FastSaver account on 1 Aug (if this 75k doesn't originate from cimb) qualifies for incremental funds compared to 31 July. Other subsequent withdrawals and deposits during Aug doesn't matter.Just my interpretation but you may like to check with cimb on clause 5c to confirm.,btohqsg
Hello. For EGA bonus interest promotion  can I withdraw all the money inside right after the last participating month (i.e. July). Bonus interest will only be credited 31 Sep and the customer service officer recommended I keep the month in EGA until i receive the bonus.,btohqsg
HSBC told me I can take out on 1 August so I did üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg

Uob lady doesn't have this MCC as bonus points right,btohqsg
Why UOB lady‚Äôs with Amaze? Online is not required,btohqsg
I think UOB KF works right? Anyone else can confirm?,btohqsg
does it give 3mpd on overseas spend?,btohqsg
So NET* transaction with MCC 5499 (for example) is still eligible for the 6.67% Cashback + min $600 spending right,btohqsg
i think uob kf + amaze should work  but yet to try,btohqsg
Currently due to a promo rate until 31 aug  must be oversea spending in foreign currency min of $1.5k spending,btohqsg
yes but after that what will be the mpd?,btohqsg
1.2 mpd after promo   better to just use it with amaze,btohqsg

It depends on what did you spend n is it in the exclusion list.  Is the $2k part of instalment.,btohqsg

The wedding planner provided the MCC 7011  so this is not considered as a monthly instalment right?,btohqsg
You mention instalment is because you are planning to pay the wedding in instalments or what? Because if so  no matter the MCC  it is considered an instalment. A bit confusing,btohqsg
I believe this is a private instalment arrangement between the hotel/restaurant and you. The transaction is considered a hotel expenses.Then you can check with the hotel/restaurant if you pay the bill in full using NETS  can they give you 8% or 10% discount  with that it can give you more saving compare to credit card cashback.If you can‚Äôt pay in full n need the private instalment arrangements   pls read this‚Ä¶.https://youtu.be/ZhpIF6v8K6UPls check the bank credit card website for latest update before making payment as some info may have outdated. Eg. DBS Altitude 3mpd.,btohqsg
I mention instalment because I asked if I can pay a monthly amount in advance prior to the wedding date  they said can and they can provide up to four links to make payments,btohqsg
Oh ok. So not a bank-partnered instalment plan  rather it‚Äôs a retailer instalment payment plan. Then it should be eligible,btohqsg
I believe it is a private instalment arrangement. I can try to ask if there is any benefits to pay in full using NETS. Thanks for the tip,btohqsg
Yes it is not a bank-partnered instalment plan  thanks for clearing that up for me,btohqsg

U did it on a weekday?,btohqsg
My One account also instant but just applied my EVOL not sure when will approve...,btohqsg
UOB can approve credit card application instantly if the applicant meet the criteria. My  UOB credit card was approved instantly. If the applicant background cannot fully meet the requirements  they need backend office staff the review manually.,btohqsg
Yup. I did it on a Thursday evening after working hours,btohqsg
Does AXS accept payment using Amex card?,btohqsg
Alrights shall see tomorrow if there are any updates,btohqsg
Did they ask if you want delivery of self pick-up?,btohqsg
Credit cards don't have the option...,btohqsg
Oh I see  sorry haven't applied for any before... Thanks for the advice!,btohqsg
Then this might be the cause of delay like what Mouse Hunter said. If you meet criteria and have a proper credit score  it's pretty likely you will get it approved almost instantly.,btohqsg
I do have a sub card under uob though... Does that count to the credit score?,btohqsg
Agree  I think UOB does lag behind other banks in terms of credit cards. Not sure why  this is just my personal experience,btohqsg
Interesting. Personal experience is that my first credit card with upb was approved within 1 day. The 2nd one was automatic approval,btohqsg
I assume that 1st one took longer because new to bankBut I have heard from self employed friends with very good iras pay slips that have their applications rejected or take super long,btohqsg
For Shein vouchers  can we get 4mpd using CRMC ?,btohqsg
Hi community MCC 4812  have a large upcoming transaction of over 10k  can't seem to find a card on heymax that provide reasonable Cashback or miles for the entire amount.Hoping for 3%/3mpdand above for Cashback  milesMay I seek advice from the community here. Thank you!,btohqsg
Hi  how long does HSBC require to process credit card application,btohqsg
It‚Äôs hard to say the best  everyone are different,btohqsg
Mine was approved within a day. Apply via uob app,btohqsg
What is sub card? Supplement card?,btohqsg
But in term of volume of customer  probably they should be in top 3  along with Citi and dbs,btohqsg
Sc Manhattan  but not sure what is 4812  if they‚Äôre excluded,btohqsg
But Manhattan no longer available for new customer and max only 6600$,btohqsg
Sure I can use card up and other similar methods  but you need to pay for the miles that way right? I read that with Amex Highflyer you can pay for income tax without any cost. But they have stopped giving miles for grab pay top up  which I think effectively removed the method of payment of tax through AXS.,btohqsg
This card is best for nearly everything we spend online and contactless. Do note the definition of contactless for UOB Evol is Mobile Contactless which require customer to add the card to their phone e-wallet (i.e. ApplePay or GooglePay).,btohqsg
If your tax is 100k  maybe should just ask UOB RM to apply the Reserve card for you? I'm sure they can push through for your card application.,btohqsg
Hi morning  which credit card best to use to buy monthly concession pass on simply go app ?,btohqsg
If your $100k income come from full time employed or self employed  commission based  rental income or dividend or business ?,btohqsg
Not 100k income  but 100k tax,btohqsg
Didn't he said his tax was $20k a month ($240k at least tax - not income.)  now become $100k tax ?maybe need to take ROSE math problem sum again  not very accurate?https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/107351,btohqsg
Probably getting older so do less and paid less ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
That $20k tax a month message was just few weeks again. Or maybe too old forgot ?,btohqsg
Read the screenshot and the link also provided.,btohqsg
Wtf is this pointless argument about lol,btohqsg
Another message saying you use paypall to pay the link. And MT clarify why you can pay above citi limi..,btohqsg
This conversation totally no substance  can just private message????,btohqsg
"read your message in the SS.. ""I have to pay more than $20k a month in income tax"".  I rest my case if you deny what you said.. otherwise people keep responding to false information given.. what's the point.",btohqsg
I will be still very happy if my tax can achieve 50% of yours  which probably not possible in my lifetime,btohqsg
No point discussing over this. Let's move on with positive finance topics. If you have any grievances  take it to PM. Further discussion on same topic will be deleted.,btohqsg
If we Keep our bank account zeroDoes anybody know what if what if we don‚Äôt have enough balance to pay the fall below fee ?Will bank still charges us fall below fee in others  way ?,btohqsg
hey all  does dbs womens card earn miles on teledoctor transactions? thank you,btohqsg
nothing will happen if i remember correctly. But eventually will just close ur account,btohqsg
Oh dear  then which platform do Amex card holders pay?,btohqsg
They will close your account eventually,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGjust idea if you want interview high pay net worth individual (even with face mask) to inspire us on get such big personal tax,btohqsg
So they won‚Äôt be able to issue me saman or blacklisted me because I own them fall below fee ?,btohqsg
Actually depends on the bank. Mum has been trying to close her account with SC for 4 years and they still send her 0 dollar statements every mth hahah,btohqsg
Just take internet posts with a pinch of salt. Figures tend to get inflated or under reported at times  depending on the agenda of the OP.Even bank statement screenshots can be Photoshoppped.No need to get upset over it. Happy Monday!!,btohqsg
dont mind me hopping onto this topic.recently i submitted a request to close my OCBC 365 account because i cannot find any use for it anymore + their recurring transfer records is damn messy because cannot delete old 1s.would there be any issues if i try to reopen in maybe 1-2 years time?,btohqsg
not that i know of  i had a few accounts  but i dont really use it.i just empty out dont let them deduct. currently trimming them slowly.,btohqsg
on a positive note  you may be pleasantly surprised that many professionals tend to see a quick/large bump in their compensation package once they pass 35 years old. Typically that is when they are made manager and they have access to additional compensation schemes like stocks / stock options.,btohqsg
Think she did. Went like 3-4times the first year,btohqsg
Then she gave up after that. Just throw the statements into paper recycling bin.,btohqsg
oh that's weird  I also have one unused scb account for years  and they email me to go to branch to close it  but I still lazy,btohqsg
what was the reasons they give?,btohqsg
I think initially they told her the termination process was still ongoijg,btohqsg
So she waited. And waited. And kept getting the same response. But she also doesn't have email so maybe if they tried to contact her again after that she won't know,btohqsg
wah.....now you got me worried. i submitted to close my CC account with SCB via app.i received an email telling me they will call me in 3 days. and that was almost 3 weeks back.my SCB app dont have this card details anymore. not sure if they legitly closed it already,btohqsg
Not sure if card applies the same way. Mum was a savings account. No fee for 0 balance or anything. I think credit card account banks have more incentive to close?,btohqsg
haha i took their rewards $250 though but its from moneysmart promo.i only spend like maybe $500 on it,btohqsg
Nice  with myinfo now it's definitely easier to do credit card  rewards churning haha..I'm too lazy myself to keep track of what cards to cancel and banks to reapply for after the period,btohqsg
Hi all  can i know usually how fast does HSBC credit the points? transaction reflected on the travel 1 card  but points not yet posted.and when will they charge the annual fee  cause have not seen it yet,btohqsg

Has anyone received the redemption SMS for JBL Reflect Flow Pro (or $50 cash credit) for UOB Online Account Opening Flash Deal (20-22 March)?,btohqsg
Hi  how long does HSBC require to process credit card application,btohqsg
Is it worth to pay income tax using cc (cardup or citipay all)?,btohqsg
It really depends on how much you value a mile and the ongoing promotions for citipayall at that point in time,btohqsg
Yep I can do that... I currently have Citi rewards... But ya... cap rewards to 1000 dollars...,btohqsg

Hi  I applied UOB Solitaire card two weeks ago and no response yet. I called the CS # but it makes me wait more than 30 min. Do you know any direct hotline number?,btohqsg
I almost gave up    UOB sucks,btohqsg
UOB left a sour taste in my mouth. My card application was stuck for 4 weeks. Then I went to the Chat Support  and provided my reference number. In 5 minutes it got approved.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/chat.page?i_cid=contact-3col-link,btohqsg
Yeah uob chat is more helpful,btohqsg
"I think this is the result of the who Taylor Swift x UOB Priority Ticketing saga. So many people applied  credit division overwhelmed. I think if you knock then they prioritise as a ""genuine"" card user.",btohqsg
Paiseh  can't online. Physical card payment terminal üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
How did you apply?Instead of calling you can go touob.com.sg/chat,btohqsg
I do not have the NRIC number as I am a foreigner,btohqsg
and they ask the credit card 16 digit code to login but I terminated my UOB one card thee months ago so I only ge t this message,btohqsg
i'm facing similar issue because i'm new to UOB so when i enter my NRIC  it says it is unable to process my request. i think when i call the general hotline  they also ask me to enter my NRIC but then same thing  they cannot recognise. thinking how else i can expedite my credit card application lol,btohqsg
Ocbc TR can cover until 13.3K  but not sure if your store is on the whitelist,btohqsg
hotline is running again for more than 10 min,btohqsg
ant the hotline is running for 10 min again,btohqsg
Is there any branch I can visit. Normally when I viist the bank branch  they say they cannot handle the credit card issues,btohqsg
Does anybody know customer service email address?,btohqsg
Heard if you have RM with UOB u can ask RM to push for you.Will PM you the number for their telesales team for u to check,btohqsg
hi popo  can PM me too? much appreciated!,btohqsg
I finally got connected; they say my application is pending because they need further supporting docs but I sent all required docs to the email (sg.uobpendingdoc@uobgroup.com). Again  the tele service manager says she can't help me on this... they are terrible,btohqsg
I got approval on CITI card in one day usually. UOB is terrible.,btohqsg
Does anyone knows how to close DBS multipler Account,btohqsg
Which Citi credit card you got the approval and you are applying uob solitaire card as foreigner now with $120k minimum income ?You want try applying UOB Lady first?,btohqsg
If you dont mind update the info here. I have been wondering too,btohqsg
https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/support/bank-account-closure.htmlHave to transfer your remaining balance out before closing account,btohqsg
Did yuu leave the minimum $2k?,btohqsg
Any reco for which miles credit card to get  mainly for hotel + flight bookings. Was looking at DBS altitude or UOB PRVI,btohqsg
I would think is UOB Ladys tagged to travel. haaha,btohqsg
we get 6-10miles per dollar on like kaligo/expedia for DBS alt and UOB PRVI. Is that good?,btohqsg
the prices on those unique weblinks are usually most expensive. So you need to decide whether you want to pay extra for those miles,btohqsg
Only problem is the $1k monthly cap.,btohqsg
Hi guys. For DBS vantage card I see have 10 complimentary access to lounge. Can I bring 9 guest with me and utilize all the 10 access in one time ?,btohqsg
Thanks !Do you know any other cards that allow to bring guest and deduct from the main card holder access ?,btohqsg
There are several others so long as it's main passholder +1 guest. But no other cards come close to bringing in as many guests as DBS Vtg has to offer.,btohqsg
How about HSBC visa infinite. I see it can bring in sup card holder . So I can apply 10 sup card? Or is there a cap how many sup card I can apply ?,btohqsg
up to five supplementary cardholders can enjoy the same benefit  free of charge.,btohqsg
Five supp cards i think. Each card holder can only bring themselves in.,btohqsg
Exactly  I had the exact same experience. Sent in my documents three times over three weeks before they finally processed it.In the end they rejected me even though I easily pass the income requirement  no outstanding taxes  no loans  only have 1 other credit card  and my main debit card is UOB so they know I can definitely afford it.Terrible experience,btohqsg
Are you full time employed and the income from your full time employment more than $120k?How many years you have been working in your current company?Are you local or foreigner?Have you terminated any cards last 5 years n how many?There are other factors that bank reviews before approving a credit card.,btohqsg
Is there age limit to apply sup card ? For example if I apply for my parents 70 years old and my daughter 3 years old,btohqsg
Look at your statement. You will see your statement cycle from there. If statement date is 6 jul  then your statement cycle is 6 jul to 5 aug (if i m not wrong). Nothing to do w approval date,btohqsg
Then follow the tnc of your specific promotion lor.,btohqsg
I would recommend you calling into HSBC hotline to enquire. Last known age of supp card holder would be min 18 years of age.,btohqsg
I wonder if the account will go negative from the minimum fee charge.,btohqsg
For UOB cc renewal  normally will the bank send you the new card after expiry? My card expires in Sept and the chat assist told me it will be end Aug or early Sept I can receive the new card. I have auto-deduction of bill on 1st Sept.,btohqsg
that would mean an overdraft... don't think they will do that unless you have an overdraft facility,btohqsg
I read that UOB does go negative  and SCB deducts the fall below fee the next time you top up the account.,btohqsg
Hey guys! Not sure if anyone have experience with UOB Lady‚Äôs yetI am currently travelling at the moment and paid my hotel and flight expenses with the UOB Lady‚Äôs card.Just logged into the UOB TMRW app and saw that I‚Äôm credited 1UNI$ per 5 dollars spend instead of 15UNI$My selected category is travel and is also verified by an online UOB chat agent.Other useful information;The merchants I paid to are Hyatt  IHG and Singapore airlines.I have not been billed and statement has not been issuedThanks for the help guys!,btohqsg

Cimb is increment only so one month park there another month move back gxs,btohqsg
is not. ref month is July,btohqsg
Later all the money will be move out from GXS,btohqsg
Is there any CC that's good for insurance premiums with air miles or rebate?,btohqsg
I July move my cash to gxs so my cimb no increment liao lo,btohqsg
bingo. I wonder how they're gonna fund their loans now,btohqsg
Aha  at the ntuc fairprice? Do they take kris +?,btohqsg
Maybank VI if you qualify. Otherwise UOB Absolute or Amex TCB if they accept Amex,btohqsg
Nid maintenance just park gxs sua,btohqsg
eh I ask you. did you have any money in your CIMB account on 31 July?,btohqsg
Can only pay with krispay miles,btohqsg
Oh u pay with miles. I wouldn't use my precious miles at ntuc üòÇ,btohqsg
Just saw horizon have also. Note sure if it's correct,btohqsg
I move out cash at late july,btohqsg
oh ok then no have...because the reference is based on end of day balance on 31 July. so if you have money at EOD of 31 July then you subtract that amount to calculate the 3.5% interest rate,btohqsg
Krispay mile earn from bonus cant be transfer to krisflyer  only base miles can. So i just redeem to ntuc when there is miles bacl promo  if not those miles expire is 6 month i think,btohqsg
late July meaning  on 31 July EOD  you got money inside CIMB? If your CIMB account balance was $0 as of 31 July  then you can take advantage of the CIMB promo,btohqsg
Anyone find it odd that they are taking EOD 31 July as reference instead of July ADB.,btohqsg
why not. it's their prerogative as to how they want to run their promo,btohqsg
End of July I gt around 2k,btohqsg
anyone know for moomoo if you transfer USD back to bank  will bank charge the $10 fee for foreign currency fee thingy,btohqsg
Just concerned it might be a wording mistake in the t&c.,btohqsg
What happen to the amount at 31 July base interest,btohqsg
so basically first 2k earns 1.5%  any incremental amount earns 3.5%. still a good deal,btohqsg
Until Dec right this promo ref all the way at 31july,btohqsg
Just take it as 2.5k around there for me,btohqsg
Until Jan 2024 if not wrong,btohqsg
Lol dam it if I know i left it zero,btohqsg
1st aug 2023 to 31st Jan 2024,btohqsg
But so far how‚Äôs the performance of it? Is the capital fund value maintained?,btohqsg

Haha was talking to my colleagues whether halfway they‚Äôll change int rates cos they hit quota liao then rly drop wth lol,btohqsg
Personally  i expected this move to come. Just not so fast,btohqsg
oh yam just saw the email notification too. Good times don't last.They cannot get hold of enough lending base to offset the deposit rates,btohqsg
"From POEMS T&C""However  to be eligible for the promotion  only the net balance of deposits at the end of each day of the 30-day period will be calculated for the 5.8% p.a. returns.""Meaning just park 50K in the end of August to get the 5.8%??",btohqsg
Agreed make full used of it before it game over,btohqsg
Thank you!Unfortunately 4812 isn't in their whitelist.,btohqsg

I just called cimb on the 3.5% promotion.. but I'm confused by what they say.1. Incremental balance is as compared to 31 July balance2. I need to opt in via qr code3. When I deposit money in. I cannot take out anything. If I take out anything. I will not be able to enjoy promo interest.4. If I deposit 10k this month. Next month must be equals or more than 10k. If not I cannot enjoy interest.Mine is an existing starsaver account.. do you all think it's weird or the customer service officer is wrong?,btohqsg
Customer service is wrong...refer to the following link for the real T&Cs:https://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/promotions/latest-promotions/accounts/casa-sep22-promo.html#Existing%20Customers%20,btohqsg
The 4th point applies to new customersNot existing customers,btohqsg
If u have shopee account u are probably invited automatically,btohqsg
Couldnt agree more. I am happy with the rate and saving to pockets.,btohqsg
Basically you only get the 1.5% in sept if your august balance is 10k but Sept balance is 9.5k if you're new to bank,btohqsg
My eye is a bit blur now. What I read n see is ‚ÄúWE HURT YOU‚Äù.üòÇ,btohqsg
Looks like cimb is the next best place to move the funds even for existing customer,btohqsg
FYI Starsaver is a current account  $5k needed,btohqsg
exisiting customer is base on july balance if zero means any amt in deposit will get 3.5% pa for 6 mths,btohqsg
Say I open account with cimb on 17 Aug and transfer money in. I will be getting pro rated interest of 3.5% on the 1st Sept?,btohqsg
In the first place  3.5% is a per annum rate. You need to divide by 365 = 0.00959% per day. Then multiplied by however many days you're putting into your account.,btohqsg
Starsaver can be a savings account too ..,btohqsg

Am deciding whether which 2 banks should I park my money UOB or DBS,btohqsg
Do you fulfill the UOB one account requirements. If yes then UOB one has highest effective rate of 5% at 100k,btohqsg
actually not much difference but GXS 3.48% per day is like 3.54% pa so probably will wait till 17 August 0030H zero out once the last interest is in,btohqsg
How is reference month decided? I realize I have a fast saver acc because I signed up for FD earlier in January,btohqsg
<_< I personally put dbs as my salary crediting account  use posb cashback (which gives interest regardless of account value) and keep my DBS account value below 10k,btohqsg
Because UOB can use DBS to pay SAL to your UOB one account,btohqsg
existing user for CIMB - Incremental fresh funds balance refers to comparing end-day-balance on that day against that of 31 July '23.,btohqsg
For employed.. ideally use uob one with 100k since the criterias are easy. If got another 100k can put ocbc 360 with your salary credited. But make sure increasing balance 500.,btohqsg
ALL EXISTING customers are fixed 31st July 2023 day end balance,btohqsg
Ohh if my current balance as at 31st July is $20 then if I put in 10k and maintain it till the 3.5% promo ends  I‚Äôll get in bonus interest of $10k-$20?,btohqsg
eh it doesn't make sense la... whoever wrote the TNC of the CIMB promo.. how can it be based on Month-end balance.. then i just last day bring in BIG BIG money i get full month bonus/interest?,btohqsg
Yup can. Tried and tested. <_< I would move to OCBC 360 if I could but my mortgage with DBS. So more worth it still for me to stay with DBS,btohqsg
Can use personal DBS account to credit ‚ÄúSalary‚Äù to UOB one account to fulfill the UOB salary credit criteria?,btohqsg
Can. I think articles online also wrote about it before.,btohqsg
Can. 24hrs will update alrdy your uob,btohqsg
Must use FAST and select SAL payment,btohqsg
Ocbc can salary credit to uob also but only using paynow option,btohqsg
I think interest is calculated daily hahaha but you probably have to check with the bank about the details,btohqsg
That was what I was thinking too  it‚Äôs strange. Shouldn‚Äôt it be ADB for July.,btohqsg
Wow okok I‚Äôll give it a shot thanks mate,btohqsg
I am pretty sure it is a typo and they will be applying 3.5% bonus interest on[(Average Monthly Balance) - Reference Month] * 3.5% p.a. / 12 = Monthly Interest,btohqsg
How do I choose a good miles credit card for general spending?,btohqsg
10. Incremental Fresh Funds Balance refers to comparing end-day-balance on that day against thatof 31 July 2023 (‚ÄúComparison Month End-Day Balance‚Äù). For example: the daily end-of-daybalance is compared against the Comparison Month End-Day Balance until the end of theBonus Interest/Profit Earning Period.#10 tries hard to explain but confuses it further,btohqsg
General spending will be uob privi only 1.4 miles per dollar in $5 dollar spending block,btohqsg
For ocbc 360 salary criteria. Is it possible for paynow transfer and select salary will meet ocbc salary criteria ?,btohqsg
i think what it is trying to express in failed english isCIMB will compare the DAILY End of Day balance in subsequent months against the 31st July End of Day Balance... in computing the 3.5% p.a.,btohqsg
But if they don't clarify soon  I expect loads of complains from jokers who keep their CIMB balance at $1k.. then last day of the month move in $200k for a day.. and expect 3.5% p.a. for the whole month on $200k,btohqsg
those jokers are expecting 3.5% x 30 = 105% p.a.,btohqsg
OCBC is as of now  quite strict. Only giro,btohqsg
Hopefully they change it soon haha a lot of employers use paynow for salary now,btohqsg
Oh really ah  has anyone tried the paynow thing for ocbc. Tried last time and it didn't work,btohqsg
Does anyone know ifl I can get 4mpd if I use UOB preferred platinum cc to pay my dental bill payment via health buddy app?,btohqsg
no lah  this is online. mcc 8099 not under whitelisted online mcc for 10x points,btohqsg
How about if I use UOB privi miles cc? Will I get 4mpd?,btohqsg
1.4mpd yes. can use dbs wwmc or citi rewards for 4mpd,btohqsg
"actually no idea what is ""paynow via giro""",btohqsg
Do Degree Holders really earn $8 190/Month in Singapore?https://youtu.be/JlXBSOsEbcg,btohqsg

If anyone managed to do this maybe can share for the benefit of all the OCBC 360 account holders,btohqsg
Ocbc tr also have white list of merchants name,btohqsg
Probably their IT plan for stress test that their system able to handle big withdrawals on 18th,btohqsg

Or does only apply to selected merchants if payments are made on the amaze card,btohqsg
Any trades to recommend for moomoo to fulfill 5 buy trades for sign up gift?,btohqsg
If i only have less than 10k savings isit recommended for ocbc 360 now that gxs is kinda useless,btohqsg
Their 3.5% is perm? Any other conditions?,btohqsg
You need to read this if you decide to use Citi reward.https://www.citibank.com.sg/credit-cards/rewards/citi-rewards-card/pdf/10x-rewards-promotion-terms-and-conditions-2020.pdf,btohqsg
not permanent until Jan 2024  you can checkhttps://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/promotions/latest-promotions/accounts/casa-sep22-promo.html#New%20Customers%20  not really that difficult,btohqsg
Gxs announced the drop in int rate for saving account to 2.68%. But main acc has an inc of int rate to 2.38%. How does it affect us?,btohqsg
actually I interpret that then as each day's end balance is compared against 31st July.. so if you add all the daily comparisons up in a mth  u actually get a avg mthly balance so I guess they are not really wrong in a way...,btohqsg
rate drop is the big difference  from 3.48% to 2.68%,btohqsg
If you have $75k in the GXS pocket  your daily interest will be drop from $7.15 to $5.50. About $49.50 per month or $600 per year.,btohqsg
Tks guys. I feel gxs dropped in the rate too quickly. Just offered the perks then now like u turn.,btohqsg
Can hear some advices if that's the case  is uob one or uob stash the best saving account with the best int rate now?,btohqsg
Uob one is best for 100k  5% if you hit the credit card spending and salary,btohqsg
If you don't want another card or you aren't drawing income  then stash is 3%.But uob one salary quite easy to hit. Cause can use fast from another bank,btohqsg
If I only can have 50k  shld I change from gxs to uob one? Or it won't matter much hence can remain at gxs?,btohqsg
Actually any risk in using this hack? Come tax filing time  will our income become more and get taxed more?,btohqsg
Tks xing xing. If 50k sav then only can fulfilled salary credit of 2k. No spending. Can I get 3% interest? Or can get more pls?,btohqsg
1) Are you able to spend $500 on credit card every month?2). How much saving we are looking at? UOB one 5% best for $100k saving.3). Are you able to lock in your cash for 4 months?4). Are you able to increase your saving by at least $500 every month?,btohqsg
Honestly no idea. Not iras  not sure what they count as income. But transferring your money between banks isn't taxable by right,btohqsg
Tks hunter. I'm looking at 50k sav  no spending. Salary credit at 2k.,btohqsg
Without 500 spending uob one is base interest. Would not recommend,btohqsg
Stash is better for your case I think.,btohqsg
Nice. But the page didn‚Äôt state which mcc is excluded  dunno izzit same as the 1% promo?,btohqsg
"for CIMB do i need to open both current & savings? webpage use ""and"" but t&c use ""or""",btohqsg
If you're new to uobThere's a promotion.50k into uob stashYou get some cash,btohqsg
How many months you are willing to lock your fund without withdrawing?,btohqsg
Oh I have a uob sav account opened many years back. Hence dont think I'm considered new.,btohqsg
No need to be new to bank for the national savings promo. The earmarked amount aka 50k is incremental,btohqsg
If put less than 100k in UOB one can still get their high interest?,btohqsg
If I'm looking at no locked in and saving account  any other bank better than gxs?,btohqsg
I see. Tks. I'll check out at uob,btohqsg
Can but first 60k is 3.85-3.9,btohqsg
You can use the calculator on web to find out how much you will get.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.page,btohqsg
Have. Already enjoying the 1% on those spendings that other cards exclude but fsm did not exclude the mcc.,btohqsg
No locked in can consider CIMB Fastsaver and SIF Gosaver kinda,btohqsg
Hmm no lock in wise  uob stash is still OK but the higher interest is on incremental savings. So you can take money out but the balance drops and it will still be base interest which is... 0.05%?,btohqsg
If she new to cimb the interest of 3.5% is incremental amount also. Under tnc. If not its base interest of 1.5%,btohqsg
I will be new to cimb. No acc with cimb,btohqsg
The words are ÂãâÂº∫correct but the table is very very wrong.,btohqsg
UOB stash has lock in n cannot withdraw or else you loss all your interest earned on that month if monthly average balance is less than previous month.,btohqsg
I thought its just the bonus interest. Base interest is paid regardless of amount,btohqsg
How many percent is base interest?,btohqsg
So if you don't think your account balance will increase every mth don't use uob stash,btohqsg
So we are taking about either you get $125 per month without withdraw or you get $2.08 per month if you withdraw it on $50k saving on Stash.,btohqsg
is there any possible scenario where this doesn't work for hitting credit card min spendbasically have shopee store  purchase from yourself using another account/number.  use untracked shipping. after a few days just mark as complete.only downside i can think of is eat about 4-5% in commission to shopee,btohqsg

Hi can I ask if let say I open a new UOB one account and desposit 100k in aug  so I need to wait three months in order to receive the interest after I satisfy the conditions to receive bonus interest in aug?,btohqsg
No ah.1. Earmark reward given shortly after earmark2. Monthly you will get the bonus interest due based on account type,btohqsg
Where else can i stash my cash,btohqsg
Money market fund  T bills  CIMB Fastsaver etc,btohqsg
Earmark is only 30th of the mth?,btohqsg
Any way to use paynow using credit card?,btohqsg
Shucks should have put my money elsewhere until 29th :(,btohqsg
From my memory based on my last few participations about 15th of the month after deadline u will get earmarked.,btohqsg
Thanks. I am looking at uob one account satisfying the min 500 spend and three giro transactions cause I am self employed so no salary credit,btohqsg
Transferring from dbs using fast sal counts. Ocbc paynow SALA apparently also counts,btohqsg
Thank you. But I am fully self employed  and I heard that uob savings account are best for self employed workers. That‚Äôs why I am considering to switch. Previously I was Ocbc 360,btohqsg
Yup  just saying the salary credit works even from your own account,btohqsg
That's why uob one is best for self employed. Because it allows paynow/fast to qualify as salary credit  not just giro,btohqsg
How you achieve OCBC 360 salary credit requirements since you are self employed? Can share with us?,btohqsg
See. The first trick u can learn here is being mentioned above Liao.,btohqsg
Success is subjective. It depends on your objective in life. You can watch some of Chris' videos on his own thoughts  one of them is about why he no longer chase financial freedom.https://youtu.be/cchaBa5MGbM,btohqsg
Does it work the same way for ocbc too? Like I used DBS to fast transfer to ocbc 360 and indicated as ‚ÄòSAL‚Äô?,btohqsg
Ocbc seems smarter. Cannot cheat them,btohqsg
Ocbc only accept giro and paynow corporate,btohqsg
Is it smarter of ocbc or of uob that all the self employed people bank with them instead,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think they are profitable paying 5%pa on $100k.,btohqsg
Hmm I wonder how sustainable it is for them too,btohqsg
But they probably lending out at a higher interest?,btohqsg
Credit card interest  lending to companies etc.,btohqsg
Previously I was employed with salary credit. But now no more hence thinking of switching to UOB.,btohqsg
Oic. Thanks for reply. üòÄ. Many people are looking for method to fulfil ocbc salary credit requirement.,btohqsg
I have transferred all my gxs $$ into poems.. godspeed,btohqsg
Me too haha. That‚Äôs why I decide to switch üòÖ,btohqsg
Not the same products. Cannot compare savings account with mmf.,btohqsg
Just check have you received Ocbc 360 Jul bonus interest in early Aug? I still have not received  not sure miss out anything.,btohqsg
Not really leh. It‚Äôs the median.But as Chris said. Median is the 51th person in 101 people.And median age is 44 years old.Quite believable stats.,btohqsg
Hello. Can i check does UOB Ladies card - travel category include purchase of travel insurace?If no  can i use amaze + citi for online transaction?,btohqsg
Travel insurance under mcc code 6300. You can check is it in the exclusion list on both cards.,btohqsg
actually i read the tnc of UOB one account. It says salary credited via FAST is excluded.,btohqsg
Not sure anyone calculated. Assuming existing cimb fast saver have abt $100 reference funds. Is it more worth to keep 75k in gxs till 31 aug or move to cimb from 17th aug (assuming cimb use daily average balance calculation..roughly 75k/2 balance @3.5%),btohqsg
you don't shift now. Sekali GXS pull some shenanigans closer to 17 Aug or CIMB terminate signups early. then gg.,btohqsg
"That said  i noticed for the cimb promotion  you need to ""sign up"" via the cimb automated whatsapp. Like the moomoo promo like that",btohqsg
anyway the difference over 10 days is 41 cents in favor of CIMB. any daily compounding of 41 cents over 10 days is negligible. I rather transfer now and not wait for GXS to do anything funny,btohqsg
I just activated the cimb promo via whatsapp,btohqsg
But how do they know how to tie back to my account. Via my phone number?,btohqsg
Probably. Your WhatsApp number and bank phone number is the same right,btohqsg
Yes. Hopefully it is registered. I dont see any confirmation,btohqsg
I mean apart from the whatsapp  there is no email confirmation or notifications from cimb clicks,btohqsg
Not that high with bonus  aws and CPF factored in,btohqsg
I got my bonus interest last 3 mths using that method. Can also see sethisfy article on this. Not the only person to do it this way,btohqsg
My zym app indicate that the number successfully port over Liao but when call to the number it says ‚Äúnot in use‚Äù . Any idea how long have to wait ?,btohqsg
Confirm that on the app it's showing your original number instead of the temp number? This morning my number ported just fine.,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone knows which credit card is the fastest to get? I need to buy things immediately,btohqsg
At least you need to let people know what items you plan to buy n where you plan to buy it from. Credit cards have exclusion list. Some cards may not suitable for you unless you don‚Äôt mind no rewards.,btohqsg
Which banks‚Äô cards you currently have? If a bank has your financial history n your approval will be faster.My experience with OCBC is received physical credit card within 48 hours after applying online. OCBC Debit card can be issued at Punggol branch on the spot within 1 hour.,btohqsg
I realised cimb clicks no longer require 2FA to perform FAST transfers. Is it safe?,btohqsg
You need 2FA to log in anyway,btohqsg
It used to sms me 2fa. But now no more. I just log straight in,btohqsg
I called cimb. They said once the digital token is fully activated  you dont need manual OTP,btohqsg
In theory if digital token is running ni Ned otp,btohqsg
Hi gurus. What card you all use to pay for insurance? AIA  CHUBBS  ALLIANZ AND ETC..A,btohqsg
It works now  whether intentional or not (probably the latter). You can verify it easily too  after performing the fast transfer it'll show in iBanking that the salary requirement is satisfied.,btohqsg
I remember quite a lot of people asking this question before  perhaps you can search the chat history to get multiple views from different people. Then you can decide which one is best n suitable for you.,btohqsg
Intentional haha its on their official website so not loophole,btohqsg
Hi gurus thanks for the reply.Actually I did search and I saw uob absolute  amex tcb and Maybank plat.Those are all cash back right? How do I count the caps. Many numbers üòÇ,btohqsg
Actually now I‚Äôm not sure of any easy way to pay insurance and earn ‚Äúfree‚Äù rewards.Paid option like payall or cardup is always there but it seems ‚Äúfree‚Äù methods are all gone.,btohqsg
A lot of insurers don‚Äôt accept Amex,btohqsg
So the best is Maybank plat?,btohqsg
But got capMax 100 cashback for 3mthsAnd need to be minimum spending per mth,btohqsg
Maybank plat visa.3.33% cash back  minimum 300buck monthly for every quarter,btohqsg
300 min spend for $30 quarterly cashback1000 min spend for $100 quarterly cashback,btohqsg
1.7%. But insurance premiums are usually higher than 1k at one go for yearly no? And mthly premiums are usually.more expensive than yearly. So maybank platinum can be used but limited cashback also,btohqsg
I have some which is already monthly. So those I can divert to this card.Maybe from your advise I will check how cheap it is to do annual.,btohqsg
If it is prudential  i usually can do prepayment on the pru app partially  then when the next month hit  i will clock again  that is how i spilt the annual payment,btohqsg
Through their iPay? I thought it only allows you to pay 15 or 20 days in advance..,btohqsg
Aia i do thru axs maybank fnf  then giro for the cc,btohqsg
Shall go do the math haha.,btohqsg
Fnf meaning? Sorry Im new to it,btohqsg
Maybank fnf 0.3 percent up to 50 per payment  then giro for hsbc for maybank friend and family get 1 percent if u fulfill the critertia,btohqsg
So total is 1.3 percent if u got time to do such method  if not giro thru hsbc for insurance loh to get 1 percent,btohqsg

The short answer is: if you think rates will likely go down during your loan period  then floating. If u think rates will go up during your loan tenure   then go for fixed. If you don‚Äôt know whether rates will go up or down  then it doesn‚Äôt matter in the grand scheme of things ü§£,btohqsg

quarterly rebate is $30/$100 = max 3.33%,btohqsg
Is this better than the Uob One that I signed up this month. It says 3.3% for all spends. Does it mean that I should spend only max $2000 per month üòÖif I could üòÑto maximise the rebates. Any amount above this I should use another card,btohqsg
unless it's special categories like Shopee  then you can exceed 2000k,btohqsg
Oh I c. So there are categories that is exempted from this $2000 cap. I‚Äôll go and find out more. Very confusing,btohqsg

My personal favourite is how they masked the last dining and travel nerf as a ‚Äúboost‚Äù by introducing categories that not many ppl will spend much $ on. OCBC marketing tok kong,btohqsg

Should‚Äôt be  I‚Äôm getting 1.5% from Simply Cash,btohqsg
Depend how much different  if not much then just ignore and move on,btohqsg
It is not much but don't u think morally it is not right that the bank don't inform depositor that by putting more fund in that particular acc don't earn interest or less interest than they would get if fund r kept in other acc. The amt is negligible.  I am sharing my experience cos I transfer fund to my mca acc n have 2800 n my saving acc have 1000. My saving acc have 4cts credited n my mca acc despite having much more do not rec any Interest at all,btohqsg
