It's a conspiracy. She's definitely team cashback so trying to prevent you to get your miles. You might want to reconsider her.,btohqsg
Maybe wise might have dong  but from what i know other wallet dont keep dong so really dont know what your gf is telling u.,btohqsg
He cant reconsider lah  gf got the upper hand.,btohqsg
Her arm longer so she can reach higher?,btohqsg
She keep tell me revolut card atm withdrawl up to sgd 350 is free. No charges,btohqsg
Everything he write is gf say this and say that mah,btohqsg
Sgd 350 enough? Have to spend for all her meals and her shopping,btohqsg
just realized amaze card cannot link to visa card.... mastercard is the only way? or any workarounds?,btohqsg
Vietnam alot of place take cash only haha.,btohqsg
The gf must never find out YouTrip can withdraw S$400 without charges. The S$50 need to stay in HSBC EGA to earn 4.65% p.a. Not UOB Stash account.,btohqsg
If gf find out mean 350 plus 400 more cash for allowance liao,btohqsg
Oh ya. $750 not just $400. Even $150k in UOB One account at 4% p.a. also not enough to cover. Need to put into HSBC EGA for 4.65% p.a. Not UOB Stash account!,btohqsg
Still *cheap* to maintain  next time got kids can raise in vietnam also. Cheap cheap,btohqsg
$750 per month not cheap liao. Some people cannot afford,btohqsg
My dad still give my mum a full time housewife allowance of 1 plus k so 750 for gf ok lah  somemore is young gf,btohqsg
Wife ok la. Gf can run anytime legally,btohqsg
Anyone knows if I can use Mastercard‚Äôs exchange rate to gauge how much amaze will charge me for an online transaction made in foreign currency? I saw from previous post that there is like a 1.9 to 2.2% markup?,btohqsg
U just add ard 2 percent to the day rate loh,btohqsg
So 2% on top of Mastercard rate right? Means still better than citi 3.25% if I check out with citi rewards directly and amaze don‚Äôt charge foreign currency transaction fee.,btohqsg
Wife can run also plus demand maintainence if divorce haha.,btohqsg
That's right. You still earn card rewards if eligible.,btohqsg
She knows about youtrip too 400. But still prefer me use revolut when in vietnam,btohqsg
50$.. not much difference. She know that in vietnam hsbc have rewards card called Classic. Name sound better than revolution,btohqsg
Then good ma  so he can say only can withdraw 350 without charges. Want more also don‚Äôt have,btohqsg
You too slow le.. she already knows both,btohqsg
Gg  no wonder no money save in ega,btohqsg
Then ask her to use her hsbc rewards card to spend in Vietnam,btohqsg
Damn what a great idea  maybe I should use cards based on the name of the card. Like Platinum card sounds better than what SMRT card. Rewards card also not nice  not as nice as Black card.,btohqsg
1 question she ask me . I can't answer.  She say now hsbc also have 1 travel card already. Can transfer my point to her account. She want to transfer to vietnam air.... lol,btohqsg
Samsam is right  she wants your miles.,btohqsg
banks also allow funds transfer  she got ask you transfer all your money to her also?,btohqsg
I'm a miles chaser  so meaning is very safe to book through heymax via agoda?,btohqsg
Why need to transfer to her? Can‚Äôt she earn the miles herself and fly what she want?,btohqsg
She is suggesting... I need to be careful..,btohqsg
maybe she is in this chat. she thinking: seeing what he type  this one sure can makan,btohqsg
You confirm told her about all the miles and money you have that‚Äôs why she suggest,btohqsg
No.. I told her now hsbc cards spore  points can transfer to vietnam air. Means I not necessarily need to take SQ,btohqsg
Ya loh  why you need to share this with her?,btohqsg
She ask me when coming vietnam,btohqsg
cannot transfer miles to others lah,btohqsg
Actually is also good. Hsbc now got more air partners...,btohqsg
That doesn‚Äôt answer the question. Why need to tell her hsbc can transfer to which partner. You just tell her the date can liao what,btohqsg
Can I use air tickets to qualify for minimum spending of OCBC 360 of 500?,btohqsg
need to flex that he using the right card with many transfer partners!!!!üëçüëçüëçüëç,btohqsg
does anyone experiencing HSBC Revo points not giving out neither 1X nor 9X from last month?,btohqsg
No. What did you pay and whenAnd the new app can see which transactions gives you 1 point,btohqsg
ok I shall contact CS to clarify for the very low points given.,btohqsg
i spent 600 on food  only 60 points given,btohqsg
Have you met her in person?,btohqsg
Could it be because the system upgrade for pooling? That‚Äôs why the points will come in later?,btohqsg
