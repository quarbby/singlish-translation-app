Just go watch all randomly. Donâ€™t be fixated on fire. Start with making money and then making investing a habit,btohqsg
I checked with moomoo already. They said that the 5.8% return will only be credited within 7 biz days after the 30/60 days has ended from the date I start the deposit.,btohqsg
They said it is not daily return. So now I am confused  what is all these daily return u all r receiving. I am an existing Moomoo user by the way  not newly sign up. Probably the daily return is for new sign up promotion??,btohqsg
Daily return is from Fullerton fund. If there is difference between daily return n 5.8%  moomoo will top up after period ended.,btohqsg
This is what they replied me.For existing user  please refer to this link on the 5.8% p.a. cash plus promotion:https://www.moomoo.com/sg/support/topic5_728.,btohqsg
You can see in the app for daily interest  but not the 5.8%,btohqsg
I am still in doubt to put 10K in moomoo after I see so many ppl mentioned why not reflected or etc..Does it really safe?,btohqsg
I can see the daily return now. Just that the money will be credited to me after the 30 days is over.,btohqsg

The travel exclusion leah. Does not affect?,btohqsg
Kris+ retains original mcc so if you use Citi rewards+amaze any existing  exclusions persists. Once again you need to use amaze if not it confirm will be excluded when you use Kris+,btohqsg
citi rewards + amaze vs hsbc revolution  which is better? both seem to be 4 mpd. only advantage hsbc seems to have is allowing travel.,btohqsg
Keep in mind many websites such as agoda Booking.com  pelago and airbnb no longer give 4mpd for HSBC Revo,btohqsg
sorry if noob question but ive never owned a cc before. if i get both the ccs i mentioned  and only use hsbc for travel (high spend but only once in awhile) and use amaze for everything else  will be able to get waiver for both in the future?,btohqsg
i see  will take that into consideration  thank you!,btohqsg
Depends on the tnc. If they specifically state how much you have to spend for the fee waiver  then you will have to hit it the minimum to get it.Besides  chances are that you may not get the second card approved.,btohqsg
Ohh I see  forgot to consider that second part ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
