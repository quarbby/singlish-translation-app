🎉Pika World Daily Review – 29 December 2022🎉🧸Equity market hit by bears💸Equity markets could not keep up with their gains as investors digest news from the latest loosening of China's Covid-19 restrictions in a thin trading session. The Nasdaq is the biggest loser as it had fallen by more than 10% this month  likely to be its worst December on record.It does not help that the bond yield is also climbing above 3.8% for the 10-year Treasury yield on Tuesday and remain at the elevated level on Wednesday.🎢One more chance for the market to Moon📊At 9.30 pm  we will receive the Initial Jobless Claims. It is one last piece of important data for the week that could help to spark some relief rally. Even with the widespread news of retrenchment  the labour market appeared to be resilient.The Fed is heavily focused on seeing the labour market weaken. So  we will like to see a spike in the initial jobless claims to 225K from 216K in the prior period. So bad news for the job market can become good news for the equity market.Pika Nat's IBKR portfolio is massively down(probably -50%) for the year  like many others  but we will be by your side for the remaining trading days.It is 29 December  Thursday  at 8.50 am in Singapore and 7.50 am in New York. Have a cheerful day  Pika World friends!,btohqsg
