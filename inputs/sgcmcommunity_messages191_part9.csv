https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/taxi-lifespan-increase-10-years-frequent-checks-old-private-hire-2376081Taxi lifespan to rise from 8 to 10 years to cut operating costs; older private-hire cars to face more frequent checks,btohqsg
So if the phv decal is removed  how do we know if the car was previously a phv? By looking at the mileage?,btohqsg
Ownself check the wear n tear can tell liao,btohqsg
One tell tale sign is tourador tyres😂😂,btohqsg
Eh. I see new mercs w tourador hor,btohqsg
Wah. Means no plans to kill off COE PHV,btohqsg
Take a wet tissue  wipe over the decal position and see if there's a stain,btohqsg
Thing is whether dealer wan to go to such extent,btohqsg
Some say look at back seat,btohqsg
Yup whether the corner has any rubber wear off,btohqsg
Think seats n steering wheel best tell tale signs,btohqsg
If got do servicing shld b ok,btohqsg
Even PHV if well maintain still better than some random car that never get maintain properly,btohqsg
But the problem is that many of the PHV car is under rental company. Since it does not belong to the driver  they will anyhow wack and don't bother to clean or maintain the parts,btohqsg
Usually the rental company also do the bare minimum to keep cost low,btohqsg
By the time they sell to 2nd hand dealer  usually is damn shit condition,btohqsg
Popular PHV vehicle quite hard to find in 2nd hand market that has not been used as PHV before (vezel  Mazda 3 etc..),btohqsg
Drivers go for cheapest oem to keep operating cost down,btohqsg
And majority go for recon parts for replacement,btohqsg
Atleast they got do servicing. Some of the rental cars that I see like damn jialat. Last time I try use Getgo  the car wheel bearing and breakpad like cmi already. The company still don't bother to change,btohqsg
Some even buy 2nd hand tyres,btohqsg
I didn’t even do servicing. Just top up engine oil nia,btohqsg
Is this the secret to 9k rpm launch?,btohqsg
That’s the beauty of conti car. Engine Oil evaporate fast. Just top up. No need servicing,btohqsg
