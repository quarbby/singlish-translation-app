Pretty sure it‚Äôs done by one of the buggers in the group,btohqsg
These type are usually paid or targeted,btohqsg
Those type go in nia  won‚Äôt talk one. Usually paid boosting service,btohqsg
i typed in use raid mode as a message for the admins,btohqsg
there's a raid mode that rose uses  would shut off the group for awhile,btohqsg
so before you guys jump to conclusions please try to understand the intentions lmao,btohqsg
i'm not the boss lol what,btohqsg
/adminsjust a head's up. the next time there's a massive influx of bots just use/raidcommand.,btohqsg
it would block all incoming users for a few hours last i recall.,btohqsg
Why suddenly so many ppl join grp text,btohqsg
Well pretty sure someone is trying to get the group banned,btohqsg
Anyone interested? Left 1. Permission granted by@roincec,btohqsg
You buy from me to flip one issit,btohqsg

Previously U weren't in the grp idk why,btohqsg
yaaa am very sure i didnt  leave,btohqsg
Till now he still love to drive the Mazda 5,btohqsg
Mazda6 wagon looks reel sleek when slammed,btohqsg
Hi guys just asking opinion whose at wrong here,btohqsg
Er ya but theres ample space and i dont understand why he beam meüòÖ,btohqsg
Probably he felt you squeeze a bit too tight,btohqsg
Should have slowed down over take from right,btohqsg
A friend once said to me  bus just give way  we can overtake them easily,btohqsg
imo i don't think anyone is at fault  but if I were you  I would not fuck with a bus,btohqsg
If there isn't enough road  you're either eating the cones or side swiping the bus.,btohqsg
I'd generally just wait till the bus pass me then I overtake the bus from the right later.,btohqsg
there are 3 types of vehicles to always be cautious about,btohqsg
I do not fk with either one,btohqsg
PHVs drive worse than some lane splitters,btohqsg
they road hog and drive like they own the road,btohqsg
Not really trying to fuck with the bus uh but just that u see the video  the car infront of me got ample space to eat into the right lane so i was thinking maybe the road work is far and is blind spot. Cant gauge where the roadwork is,btohqsg
either that or they're kissing your ass and highbeaming,btohqsg
That's why cannot gauge  should assume for worse ah,btohqsg
Hmmmm. But its like literally stopping in the middle of the road siaüòÖ,btohqsg
Rather than just gun for it and hope for the best,btohqsg
keep a 3 second gap to blue stickered cars imo,btohqsg
No choice one when road close. On PIE you also will come to complete stop,btohqsg
Well have to be more aware i guessü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I think you're lucky to scrape it thru.,btohqsg
But i mean could be your awareness and judgement helped get you thru la,btohqsg
I've also done that a few times and told myself  that was sketchy and I should not do it again,btohqsg
But i also lie myself  damn  i'm such a good driver  being able to squeeze in like that with no issues. When shit really goes wrong  no one else to blame except ourselves. So... Why take the risk? ü§£,btohqsg
End of the day  you and the bus made it to your destination with no issues  I think can just forgive and move on la. Just some food for thought to see how you could have handled it better.,btohqsg
knn if i teach ppl wrong thing  i'll just say gun only  make other ppl jam brake. LOL,btohqsg
want go left want go right also dk,btohqsg
is it my fault or his,btohqsg
This one confirm your fault LOL,btohqsg
He cannot decide  and you also just gun and hope for the best,btohqsg
By right cannot swerve  e brake and hope for the best,btohqsg
If it's me i'd join him behind swerve left and right,btohqsg
then we will look like warming up tyres at formation lap,btohqsg
we need no truth nor toxic,btohqsg

if yr know anyone hiring part time pm pls tyty not fnb can ale,btohqsg
Idk man. Just asking for public opinion üòÖ might be anybody fault la. But sometimes i feel buses are abit self entitled on the roadüòÖ,btohqsg
The bigger the feller  all the more you give way,btohqsg
I agree uh. Smaller vehicle sure have losing end.,btohqsg
But that's why I see cyclist and I'm like  these fellers got death wish,btohqsg
They just need a driver to be in the wrong state of mind  and that's it,btohqsg
He disagrees with your judgement call to squeeze through,btohqsg
But in the event there was any collision u would have lost 100% based on video,btohqsg
Yes because the bus did not encroach as u were passing  he was already partially in the lane due to road conditions and u proceeded,btohqsg
Best option to me would have been slow down move to right lane then overtake the bus,btohqsg
If the situation had mirror and overtake on right  still at fault because the safe decision would be not to attempt to pass,btohqsg
All right noted guys thanks for adviceüëç,btohqsg
Or a lorry to play bowling with them,btohqsg
And now my dad is facing this steering issue,btohqsg
Does it make sounds when stationary?,btohqsg
Stationary and turning the wheel makes noise?,btohqsg
Stationary no noise  only turning make noises,btohqsg
he's asking if got noise when the car is stopped and you turn the wheel,btohqsg
Yes sir. That is correct. I need to be more explicit with my question cause I realise not many here would understand üòÖ,btohqsg
Sounds like wheels issue.Something rubbing at a certain position.,btohqsg
I guess is brake pads or wheel bearings.,btohqsg
Sounds like brake pad/rotor contact  or bearing,btohqsg
I.e  bring it to a workshop and have it checked.,btohqsg
inb4 power steering fluid run out lol,btohqsg
