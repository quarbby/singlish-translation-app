it all boils down to your criteria,btohqsg
normally applicants see the direction of the wind and sun  which I think it end up at the last of the criteria list lol,btohqsg
low level  very obvious no problem if lift breaks down,btohqsg
the con   the rubbish chute next to the unit  when the truck comes to pick the rubbish,btohqsg
and people downstairs can see your furnishings,btohqsg
oh ya one important thing I realized  see if you like the layout,btohqsg
true also  valid point  learned something,btohqsg
Haha. Wind  sun and layout are good. But low level ðŸ˜… if people downstairs can see furnishing  close curtains,btohqsg
Normally rubbish chute is at ESS?,btohqsg
Nope. We plan to stay longer term,btohqsg
same  if i get it its also to stay long term,btohqsg
Haha. There is playground near my unit ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
normally people choose to siam the PP,btohqsg
where the wake is held at,btohqsg
which project are you applying or have applied?,btohqsg
if got highest floor available yet facing the pp  would you want it?,btohqsg
Sometimes...beggars cannot be chooser.  ðŸ˜‚  worst is no roof over the head. Some tries like 10x+ didn't even get a date for selection.My 5 cents thot... no evening sun facings the bedroom.,btohqsg
3 tries all got number within supply,btohqsg
1 more try then can buy 4D,btohqsg
OK as long as none of you is pantang,btohqsg
PP is abit far from my unit,btohqsg
aiya there's no perfect HDB unit,btohqsg
Haha yeah lor but I am worried cos we stay for longer term,btohqsg
so you have selected your unit?,btohqsg
For sbf this month  we selected hougang. Not unit.,btohqsg
Erm what is the name of rubbish chute in layout?,btohqsg
Oh great. It's far from unit,btohqsg
your parents are in hougang too?,btohqsg
I used to be a resident there for 21 years,btohqsg
if you take clementi  can use MCPS though there's some downside,btohqsg
Sbf allow? I tot only resale,btohqsg
maybe depends on what area  I'm not sure but my mum used it stacked with SPS during last SBF launch,btohqsg
Hahaha. If u stay near  paya lebar  Sembawang or tengah airbase ... high floor low floor doesn't matter anymore  during heavy flying...,btohqsg
Oh I just check. Sbf allow,btohqsg
But there is no sbf near clementi haha. Also clementi hdb price is exp,btohqsg
yeah the sound of freedom  and my BTO is one stop next to PLB,btohqsg
used to it since I'm staying at punggol,btohqsg
Hihi! Let's say I have applied for the SBF this month and indicated my choice of town...Then now  want to change the choice of town  is it possible?,btohqsg
not sure is it possible to amend your choice or have to spend $10,btohqsg
We can resubmit a new application?,btohqsg
But will we still be considered first timer?,btohqsg
Omg great  thanks for the clarification,btohqsg
Hi guys  just wondering  if I were to apply for May's BTO launch and get a number for e.g. macpherson weave  can I still apply for the Kovan BTO in august?,btohqsg
I'm quite sure you can  as long as you havent gone for the 1st appointment of May BTO  you can still bid for August BTO in the meantime,btohqsg
Hi Everyone! I will like to check if I applied for a BTO under MCPS.Do I qualify under the scheme if my parents own a flat in another location outside of the 4km radius but IC indicates the residency under the flat within 4km boundary?,btohqsg
definitely can  say if you're given a selection date that is after mid Sept (my guess)  you can apply for Aug BTO without any worry,btohqsg
sounds complex  but I think follow the IC address no wrong lah,btohqsg
Hahaha! Thanks thanks!Actually thereâ€™s a part 2 to that question  which makes it worse.Theyâ€™re overseas so I wonder does the MCPS still come in effect.,btohqsg
your parents have to answer video call from HDB upon your unit selection,btohqsg
To prove the residency is it?,btohqsg
