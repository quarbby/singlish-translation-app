Hi All  does Giro payment from HSBC EGA paying HSBC credit card earn 1% rebate?,btohqsg
Does paying of insurance premium consider eligible spend of $500 to qualify for singsaver rewards. Referring to Citibank Cashback + cards,btohqsg

But for platinum visa. The cashback is based on calendar month. So can just ignore the statement amount,btohqsg
You can only pick 18 or 25 (if you allow marketing promotions). But like what@E9twomentioned  calendar month matters more.,btohqsg
Thanks doing it now‚Ä¶ if I pay via uob app  considered part of the minimum spend right?Then if I clock 3 months minimum $500  paying just insurance  can get 3.33% cashback ?,btohqsg
Nope u dont get cashback for insurance,btohqsg

Don't bother with shopback. It's gonna take forever probably next year  if they confirm anything,btohqsg
Oh no no I‚Äôm a big fan of ShopBack and I already managed to successfully cash out significant amounts.,btohqsg
Can anyone advise on UOB Credit Card sign up rewards T&C? It says first 200 in each calendar month  so if you sign up now which is 22nd already then no chance of being the first 200? Or the 200 refers to from Approval date + 30days?,btohqsg
Calendar month. And no way to know if you are eligible. Better get other confirmed sign up bonus like UOB prvi,btohqsg

Hi just checking if using hsbc EGA account to pay insurance premium via GIRO     can claim 1% cash back ? T&C does not mention this clearly.,btohqsg
You ask the contractor to issue you an invoice. Include bank transfer details.Go to CardUp interface and setup the payment to the contractor.If you need some help  the FAQ there is not too bad. For more nuanced questions  ask here.,btohqsg
A lot of people did not get 1% recently. You may want to hold on.,btohqsg
Can do. There's a miscellaneous payment on cardup. Just need to submit invoice. But u need to pay to a registered company,btohqsg
