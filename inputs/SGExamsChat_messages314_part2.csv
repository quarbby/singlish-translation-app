a's prob wont be that much harder,btohqsg
not saying it'll never happen but you can always collapse due to competition,btohqsg
Ri is rly good for 2 types of ppl,btohqsg
Suddenly I see the very gaping and dumb hole in my argument LMAO,btohqsg
1. Overseas gunners who are talented2. Nerds who are smart and wanna chill,btohqsg
Yeah that was stupid to think about,btohqsg
3. u want SAF overseas scholarship,btohqsg
I think I'm 1 or 2 ngl,btohqsg
Unis sometimes sponsor u so cost shouldn't be too big of a worry,btohqsg
No leh safos can go anywhere,btohqsg
I saw the RA programme and suddenly got heart eyes LMAO,btohqsg
Among the general cutoff range bah,btohqsg
wasnt there like an article saying how most safos recipients come from ri and a few other schools only,btohqsg
my year Idt got any ri safos,btohqsg
I rmb hwach and nyjc sent some,btohqsg
Ri is hands down best sch in sg for them,btohqsg
Do u like project or exam kinds,btohqsg
Then the people who struggle in ri,btohqsg
Are people who compare too much or ppl who are more dreamy than their capability (there's no nice way to say this yikes),btohqsg
U mean RA? Idk I'm OK with both,btohqsg
the pressure of competition can honestly get q real,btohqsg
idt ill underestimate the prevalence of that,btohqsg
ra very good for overseas apps,btohqsg
The math and science hardcore training one lul,btohqsg
If you go ri just apply for it,btohqsg
I just saw it and thought it looked cool,btohqsg
I grad alr so major regrets not doing those stuff ahahha,btohqsg
I didn't rly feel it tbh I think ri is not a very competitive sch outside the top 100,btohqsg
Anws if you wanna go to ri (for overseas uni or future outcomes) gotta be ready to grind,btohqsg
If not gg to ri doesn't help that much and heading somewhere else for the envt is probably a better call,btohqsg
Since u got 12 choices then just put ri nyjc chem eng n etc lor,btohqsg
Nah. JC is pain. Thou i only can go ri arts haha,btohqsg
But the ppl who are v competitive for oversea programs sort of find jc very doable,btohqsg
I dont hate ny haha. I dislike jc as a whole,btohqsg
I think statistically Raffles will put you at a better stead for scholarships as well if cost is an issue so that's also something to think about! But yes while the individual does matter I think you should speak to Raffles and NYJC seniors to see their thoughts on their respective ECG departments,btohqsg
Statistics doesn't = outcome! Ri is this weird school where your chances of getting stuff is either a lot higher or near zero,btohqsg
I know one guy from there with safos man's q upz,btohqsg
If u have qns abt ny i can try to answer. Thou its gonna be hard to gauge compared to ri for me,btohqsg
Wasn't from RI but was from ACSI and I think the ECG department of your school does matter alot in terms of information readiness and access to opportunities,btohqsg
So regardless of which you eventually choose do find out about whether their ECG dept is good,btohqsg
Ya. The unis come to ri and hwach and prolly acsi to hold admission talks and shit,btohqsg
Japanese uni came to ny for the weebs ok?,btohqsg
yep i remember having a few uni talks and a uni fair during my time in sji,btohqsg
oh yes waseda uni came to sji also HAHA,btohqsg
That one was the one first to be out of slots,btohqsg
Also for eg the good thing about being in a sch w alot alumni in overseas uni is that ecg will usually have mentor-mentee pairings,btohqsg
If u wanna be minister  go RI,btohqsg
I'm not sure if ri does that but maybe I j a bad student LOL,btohqsg
Thou some ministers say lousy sch,btohqsg
or you can just sign up for sgexams' ecg programs,btohqsg
