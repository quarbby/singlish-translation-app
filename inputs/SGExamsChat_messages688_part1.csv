Tbh some ppl detention no use,btohqsg
i mean ur time diff from my time,btohqsg
Yea they do take it seriously now,btohqsg
Lmao‚Ä¶but i dun think jc are that into corporal punishment in the first place,btohqsg
after whatever happened at rv where the guy had mental problems?,btohqsg
U can vape in jc w/o being caned,btohqsg
But vaping in sec sch will result in caning,btohqsg
Doesnt make sense but it is what it is,btohqsg
generally there has been a shift in like emphasis on mental health in moe schools over the recent years but I can't deny that that incident may have been like a catalyst that made MOE take mental health even more seriously than before,btohqsg
Actually im just curious if anyone witnessed the sch ruling out corporal punishment,btohqsg
wait but is mental health a good reason to take leave of absence,btohqsg
I saw sm1 being caned in sec sch ah,btohqsg
I heard of someone being caned for using pen knife to cut another student,btohqsg
Idk how did it even happen in sch,btohqsg
And the one that went public (vape + truancy),btohqsg
What did he do? I know someone who got caned in pri sch but in class,btohqsg
Maybe but the rv guy is in a v sad position,btohqsg
I think he got 16y jail,btohqsg
He didn‚Äôt do anything serious but always praying a fool and causing trouble,btohqsg
Bro smoking in sec sch tf,btohqsg
My brother would hv been caned,btohqsg
If he was fr ur pri sch,btohqsg
I read about someone vaping + play truant yet complaining about being whacked too hard on stage,btohqsg
Got a new principal who was fierce asf  some mornings he would shout at my friend from the other side of the hall and we could hear him at this end,btohqsg
I actually didnt know there is caning in pri sch,btohqsg
At least it is not in the school hall,btohqsg
But fr what my friend told me experiencing someone being caned,btohqsg
She said it can be a trauma,btohqsg
sometimes we had to leave the classroom to talk because we dont know how they would react and cancel us,btohqsg
But he turned out okay in the end  I think he‚Äôs in poly now or smth,btohqsg
I hv never heard / seen my principals getting angry fr pri sch to jc,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs just to make the student feel embarrassed more than to feel pain,btohqsg
this happened to my secondary school too.,btohqsg
But well the pain is bad too,btohqsg
a guy in my secondary school  who is persistent about never handing up homework and neglecting his studies  was scolded like mad by my principal,btohqsg
If it is public it is worst  i think need make public apology,btohqsg
today no maggie and no gude,btohqsg
scolded so loudly to the point the opposite block could hear,btohqsg
Jc idt I‚Äôve seen anything serious which is surprising lol,btohqsg
Wah im sry but i think it is his fault,btohqsg
i rmb when i was in pri sch got 2 ppl caught smoking outside sch. each person spanked twice in the butt,btohqsg
there definitely have been. just that you werent made aware,btohqsg
Must be them wearing school uniform,btohqsg
theres probably stupid things like that happening at raffles  hwachong or acs... for all you know,btohqsg
