About $2+. thats why even for TBills to breakeven there is a min int yield of 2.93% and 3.33% ( i think my figure is correct),btohqsg

Any promo code for MariBank sign up?,btohqsg
I checked but cannot find Mari bank..,btohqsg
DBS Safra  Trust  DBS YUU  OUB Singtel  SC SMART  Maybank Family&Friends,btohqsg
Better off using YouTrip I feel. If you don‚Äôt have Citi rewards or UOB lady‚Äôs,btohqsg
Amaze+Maybank family for selected categories if not then Trust,btohqsg
Hi may i ask how do i use this uob one credit card cash rebate? I already switched to the lady's solitaire card from now on.1. Do i have to spend using the uob one card  then the rebate will offset this May's bill?2. If i dont spend anything this month  will the rebate disappear?,btohqsg
1. 4th month must have spending in the main card holder for the cashback to be reflected. And spending must be > cashback.2. It won‚Äôt disappear. Will be stored and reflected to offset 5th month spending.,btohqsg
Sorry pardon for my slow understanding  if my spending is $40 this month  and the cash rebate is now $51.78    will the $11.78 be carried over to next month?,btohqsg
Yes. Must have spending in month 5,btohqsg
Hi  for Moomoo cash plus 6.8%  if I deposit >$50 000 of funds  then during the 40 days guaranteed return  withdraw some of it such that it falls below $50 000  will the guaranteed returns period fall to 20 days  or will it still be 40 days?,btohqsg
Based ont&c  if you drop from 40 days tier to 20 days tier  you'll still be at 40 days  but at the reduced rate.My understanding is they will give you 20 days 6.8% p.a. after 40 days. If you drop below 20 days tier  the promo will be forfeited for you.But best to check with moomoo's CSO.,btohqsg
Is xnap pay having any issue ? Trying to scan regular QR code for payment but can‚Äôt,btohqsg
So it's best to just withdraw after 20 days since the remaining rewards don't accrue interest?,btohqsg
You can scroll up to see discussions on it.,btohqsg
Withdraw down to 10000-50000 tier I mean,btohqsg
Or must I keep even 10-50000 tier till promo period ends,btohqsg
Hi everyone  may i ask if anyone knows for UOB One account  is it safe to drain my account on 1 May? I will still get my Apr interest in on 2 May?,btohqsg
You'll still get rewards from day 21-40. My understanding based on their t&c (I may be wrong) is  6.8% p.a. of 20 days will be split to 40 days  so it will be at reduced rate and not full 6.8% p.a. You'll be given the rewards after 40 days.But best to check with moomoo's CSO.,btohqsg
Transactions after April won't affect April MAB.You can use this method to calculate the bonus interest based on MAB:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/183200,btohqsg
The $51.78 is used to offset ur Apr bill. And u still have rebate left to be redeemed. Need have spending on the card in subsequent bills to redeem the remaining rebate within 2 years  if not will be forfeited.,btohqsg
It has been two day and still cannot resolve,btohqsg
He never spend full $51.78 haha,btohqsg
Just eat at places that allow cc/online payments.When one thing goes down  find an alternative ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Hawker Centre don‚Äôt accept CC.Google pay also down,btohqsg
Go non hawker lor.. when one thing goes down  find an alternative. Or these few days just don't clock spending...,btohqsg
Best miles card for mcc8011 is? Apart from general spending card.,btohqsg
Like that stay home and eat,btohqsg
Yeah  buy groceries from NTUC can clock spending and linkpoints. Or giant can clock UOB One card additional cashback.,btohqsg
For buying stuff online in foreign website using euros. Is it better using revolut card than using my credit card. Current credit card is amex cashback and posb everyday.,btohqsg
Yup if u only hold this 2 card,btohqsg
time to apply for better cards lah,btohqsg
Too time consuming tracking many cards.. üòÇ.. These suits my spending style.,btohqsg
Does pay on NTUC/Ride Hailing Apps+ Kris+ using CRMC consider online transaction?,btohqsg
No for Kris+ as using Crmc in-app via google/apple pay is excluded from 4mpd. Workaround is Amaze+CRMC via googlepay for Kris+Most Ride Hailing apps are online except TadaNTUC via Fairprice is online if not using google/apple pay,btohqsg
Noted. Need to find workaround as keep getting .5$ fee for amaze. Due to 1k limit.,btohqsg
ok. but note that 4mpd capped for $1k in statement month. Incur 1% Amaze fees for local spend more than $1kIf online can use dbs wwmc or citi rewardsif mobile contactless/contactless can use uob ppv/uob signature,btohqsg
Yea. I keep switching with wwmc but due to the statement date  i cant make all the same. Amaze and wwmc is monthly reset but my crmc mid month. So hard to keep track,btohqsg
So tend to use crmc and didn‚Äôt keep track my amaze till they release the new nerfed,btohqsg
Side question on heymax  new user. I could see the various condition to clock max miles for cards previously  eg 4mpd online transection only  must select catergory  rewards on foreign spend etc  but seems to be gone now. Is my user problem or theres need to subscribe to anything. Thanks!,btohqsg
Just add all the cards you have to heymax  then type in the vendor you want to use  it will show what cards in your arsenal is good to use or will show other cards that good to use,btohqsg
Cannot request for your statement month to change to calendar month?,btohqsg
Tried but for citi idk why cant. So have to stick with it for years,btohqsg
Does citi app show how many points clock per transaction like uob does?,btohqsg
Not per trasaction sadly. Its all accumulated monthly statement. They remove that function last month or 2 months back,btohqsg
Yea. Called in years back. Maybe i should ring them again to try luck again. Its been years. Lol,btohqsg
Haha weird. Most banks able to,btohqsg
Maybe my cso that time cmi one. Lol,btohqsg
Last i tried to change citi statement month  they said can only change to 5  10  15 or something like that. Cant exactly sync to calendar month. Not sure why citi system so weird.,btohqsg
