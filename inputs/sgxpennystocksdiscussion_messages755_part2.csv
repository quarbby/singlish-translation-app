🎉Pika World Update 25 January 2023🎉🧯Stocks wobbled with mixed corporate earnings🔫Major indices are down as optimism that breathes life into the financial markets is shifting their wind given the stormy clouds forming with the latest earnings results from the significant corporate that signalled a downpour is still happening on the economy.For one  we saw Nasdaq rise sharply in the after-hour after the announcement of Microsoft results but swing deeply in red after poor guidance was issued. Likewise  the PMI data for S&P'purchasers' managers' index came in at 46.8  which is higher than the 46.0 forecasts  with a better reading from the service index of 46.6 points to a higher possibility of a soft landing  which helps to cushion off some risk-off sentiment.Nonetheless  with Microsoft's weaker guidance  indices may start to show cracks in the rally unless new positive corporate earnings arrive.💻Microsoft - A mellow earnings that are ok  but guidance is rocky💸The tech giant posted a slightly better-than-expected result  mainly powered by its cloud computing business. Yet  this piece of result is shadowed by weak guidance for the March quarter There is a clear sign of weakness seen in the PC software business. Azure public cloud business is the highlight hit estimates  which is a relief  but the business outlook on IT spending continues to be a nervous point for investors.At one point of the after-hour trading  it rose by 5% only to give up the gains during the guidance call. The weaker guidance is expected to roll the market when it opens. As we had made some positions after hearing the good news (totally forget about the guidance call  lol  so learn from our mistakes)  we might book some losses on that.More earnings will be released before the market opens  and let's see the wave of sentiment again.It is 25 January 2023  Wednesday  10.05 am in Singapore and 9.05 pm in New York. It is a pretty data-light day  and all focus will be on corporate earnings. See you when the market opens.From the newsdesk of Pika World Pika Nat.,btohqsg
