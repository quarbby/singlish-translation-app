$100 an hoursay like $400 a day3-4 day per week become like 3-4k a month,btohqsg
one contract 40 hours for Dunman High,btohqsg
but I know my student can't understand him ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Prof level earns >$200k annually. $8k is nothing,btohqsg
but for sec sch I think okok only,btohqsg
but tbf tuition very eh for me 3-4k idk if worth,btohqsg
8k is like my entire net worth,btohqsg
last time my Prof for my final year project  I checked his background,btohqsg
sounds like a lot of need to grind and network,btohqsg
whatâ€™s a good way to save money,btohqsg
bachelor from Taiwan  masters from USA  PhD from Japan,btohqsg
as a broke international student in SG ?,btohqsg
and my Prof owns a company,btohqsg
for a student not bad already,btohqsg
ok lah if you got family support can,btohqsg
how much can i charge at this point,btohqsg
u PhD student  I think teach JC 1 to 1 80 to 90/hr also can get students,btohqsg
you worked hard to reach there,btohqsg
i rmb one time i offer to teach sec sch student but then i actually cmi before they decided on someone,btohqsg
I donâ€™t like easy money because I wanna feel like I earned it,btohqsg
then they called me after i stepped back,btohqsg
uni student wif publication how much can you charge,btohqsg
nvm then ill stick to interns and stuff,btohqsg
this is me personally I would be willing to pay 80 and hour,btohqsg
thing is publication is super misleading,btohqsg
rn math and phys ðŸ¤¡ but the phys i did cringe i dont want to see again HAHA,btohqsg
it can be a lot of things,btohqsg
can pay and publish to random indian journals,btohqsg
i just wondering what parents assume?,btohqsg
cos they may not know anything about academia,btohqsg
ultimately it will still boil down tocan my child improve,btohqsg
Simply put  how would you start introducing projectile motion,btohqsg
how many parts to break it downhow systemised your methodwhat are the common pitfalls to avoid,btohqsg
what is considered cheap Tuition ah,btohqsg
i mean itâ€™s more about value for money,btohqsg
starting out i set my rates super low for sec sch,btohqsg
same. But now I do JC group lessons  my students still say I charge too low ðŸ™Š,btohqsg
purposely say when they graduating last year,btohqsg
Cheapest I have seen was 25$/h,btohqsg
like cheapest 1to 1 is 25$,btohqsg
they just want their name out there as a tutor,btohqsg
but then thereâ€™s always the baseline depending on your qualifications la,btohqsg
but 1 to 1  u have to consider travel time also,btohqsg
no like they say I go to their place,btohqsg
to the parents it's a cost per hour of your lessons.But to you  it's a cost per hour of your lessons  travel time  prep time,btohqsg
Their house is the so called tuition centre,btohqsg
ya might be cheaper. But by right there's a cap. Just whether the tutor has enough integrity to follow,btohqsg
HDBs don't allow >3 students in a group  and not >10 students in total,btohqsg
so if you want to sabo any tutor operating out of a HDB... ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
By right best should be you have older family member teach you,btohqsg
