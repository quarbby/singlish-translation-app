i thought 1.7 quite average for singaporean boys alr,btohqsg
But they can pull down angels to defeat the demons,btohqsg
1.7 is not tall... I think the average in western countries is about 1.8 or slightly less than that,btohqsg
for singaporeans i feel 1.7 is ok alr,btohqsg
I guess so  because a lot of the public infrastructure is not built for people over a certain height,btohqsg
but idk why  i feel vv inferior smtimes bcuz im short lol,btohqsg
When I'm around 1.8+ people it feels inferior.,btohqsg
Being shorter is nicer cause u feel more protected,btohqsg
I keep knocking my head in the MRT though hahahhaha,btohqsg
idk why  i try not to think abt it. But somehow around taller people can't help it,btohqsg
easier to get shot at in war tho,btohqsg

I get distracted by anything and everything if I don't have my earpiece plugged in and blasting music LOL,btohqsg

It depends on the work I do. For stem subjects  music is gd. But writing  silence is best,btohqsg
Itâ€™s like being around people but not really,btohqsg
Dam yâ€™all can listen to music without jamming to it?,btohqsg

Honestly depends on subject  if language or humanities i either listen to low hums/cats purring/white noise and do. But if math i can listen to anything. If sciences  lofi helps,btohqsg

Only countries where 1.8~ is average are European countries,btohqsg
Or the Nilotic populations of South Sudan,btohqsg
But thatâ€™s not really a country and their average height is closer to 1.9,btohqsg
Do your work actively and let the knowledge seep through passively.,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of music it is,btohqsg
