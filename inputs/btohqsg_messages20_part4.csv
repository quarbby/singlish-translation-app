Based on our experience  the HDB officer will call/email if they need more documents/clarification,btohqsg
AskThis Dec bto can we submit first then remove our submition before 11dec if we change mind,btohqsg
I believe you should be able to cancel but won't get $10 back. Can I ask why not submit on the last day instead? It's not first come first serve,btohqsg
Oh no matter right if submit day 1 or last day on Dec 11,btohqsg
Yes. So you can wait til you've decided  to apply,btohqsg
So no need to rush! Just submit before the end timing  like don't do it at 11pm that night haha,btohqsg
Hi. Anyone has other contact number that i can call to HDB regarding HFE application status? the usual service line seems not to worküòì thanks in advance!,btohqsg
Guys can I ask what exactly does application rate mean? I saw the definition on the Website but it doesn't make sense when I calculate myself?,btohqsg
"Hi  when you say ""what exactly does application mean"" what part of the application are you unsure of?",btohqsg
This is roughly how the calculation works using Bukit panjang 4rm as example,btohqsg
Ahh OK that's why it didn't tally off it  missed your first step,btohqsg
So to keep it simple lower than 1 means can get  above 1 and higher the number means more worst üòÖ,btohqsg
Yes  essentially! The higher the application rate the lower the chances of you getting a queue number are. If the overall application rate (1st + 2nd timer) is at 1 or below  then everyone will get a queue number within supply. If 1st timer application rate is 0.95 / 0.85 (depending on flat type) then all 1st timers will get a queue number within supply,btohqsg
Hi guy   can I check with you guy I‚Äôm Singaporean   my wife currently waiting for her PR approval so can I apply HFE now or wait until PR approve ? Appreciate guy üôèüôè,btohqsg
Can I ask what will happen if I apply now ? Is it straight reject becos my wife haven PR yet ? üôè,btohqsg
Icic thank a lot for the information üôèüôè,btohqsg
Please check on the levy to pay when apply with pr too,btohqsg
hi all  can i ask if i apply for dec 2023 bto  can i still apply for the next bto or sobf?,btohqsg
I have call to HDB hotline to confirm  as long as your queue no are out of the supply units you can apply for next BTO.,btohqsg
@peanutaidenmumyes you should be able to  but the next SBF will be in 2024  I'm not sure what the rules are for if the results for Dec 2023 launch haven't come out,btohqsg
I got my queue no xxx for queenstown Tanglin Halt BTO Oct 2023 & slightly of of the supply unit  I will still trying my luck for Dec'23 BTO.,btohqsg
not in Jan 2024 dear.. there are some areas for SBF 2023 unit selection are yet to clear ya.. punggol & queenstown are one of those ‚úåüèº,btohqsg
I understand that  but shumeiz was asking about applying for the next SBF / bto launch  which is why I said Jan 2024 is the next SBF launch üòÑ,btohqsg
hmm how sure are you that it's Jan 2024 when HDB is not even being specific on the recent press.,btohqsg
Another grp mentioned next SBF wont be in Jan 24.,btohqsg
i think the next exercise will be minimum Feb. cuz the Dec press release said to submit HFE application by 15 Jan to participate in the next BTO. if the SBF is earlier than that they would've highlighted it,btohqsg
yes it wont be in Jan 2024 cos like what i've said.. some SBF 2023 unit selection for some areas are not cleared.. and if you're free enough to scroll  even Tengah have yet to clear.,btohqsg
Thanks for highlighting everyone  I went back and looked at past messages as I got that impression from past messages  but I did see that articles just said 2024,btohqsg
Does SBF selection need to be over before the next SBF launches? Before late 2023 it was always twice a year in May and Nov  not sure that they would clear all the sbf before the next one launches,btohqsg
I thought those left over from sbf will just go to open booking? Nothing to do with upcoming sbf?,btohqsg
Not too sure about that  does@smchuaor anyone know about this?I was stating it this way as N√• was implying that the previous SBF needs to be cleared before the next SBF can be launched,btohqsg
So I feel they will carry on their SBF as usual and any left over for may one will go to Open booking. Else open booking no flats to sell. üòÇ,btohqsg
ya... my guess is that HDB have teething issue that's why the delay. the ballot number result was the main delay. it could have been in July but delayed to late Aug 2023.and i meant SBF 2023.,btohqsg
just hope that HDB don't delay-delay ‚úåüèº,btohqsg
Got official telegram group for plantation edge?,btohqsg
There is no official  bto chat.,btohqsg
does anyone know what's the application rate cutoff for guaranteed unit allocation? is it still at 1.7?,btohqsg
Not sure  last round the project i applied for  application rate is 1.1 but i still did not get a number.,btohqsg
oh shag that‚Äôs actl quite low,btohqsg
Btw anyone changed the BtO bedroom windows to double glazed,btohqsg
Anyone knows how does MGPS works when you get a queue number I understand that there a pre identified flats but is that for only the 3room? Or all types is pre identified,btohqsg
"""The replacement of full height windows is strictly not allowed. Permission may be granted in an instance where a damaged frame requires a complete replacement.""",btohqsg
The HDB website says full height windows include 3/4 height and bay windows.. not sure ur bedroom is what window but I think BTOs nowadays not allowed to change,btohqsg
Sorry.... may I know what does the term temporary loan means....does it mean HLE üôèüôè,btohqsg
there are pre allocated flats for all room types if you‚Äôre from mgps,btohqsg
Oh then how to improve in noise cancelling from outside,btohqsg
What noise are you referring to?,btohqsg
Just do a Google search u will find ur answer.. don't think I can advertise products here but there is a company which does retrofit double glazing using magnet with acrylic panes,btohqsg
you may consider using black out curtains though it's not 100% noise cancelling proof,btohqsg
Question - how early should I start looking at renovations for my home?,btohqsg
