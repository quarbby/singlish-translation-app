U wanna do theexplain? in my opinion i feel thats a neutral statement  just a reminder to be familiar with vector formulas  this is totally unrelated to having rights or power? i know this is off topic in this channel  you can dm reply me or in <#566986598265126912>   i dont see how any loaded language is used? i dont see how any offensive or harmful language is used? i dont see me being very agitated when typing that  and i used “please”  not even a command  which jus shows it is a little nudge  so how does “right” interfere with that statement which i said? did i command him/her? did i force him/her to memorise? did i scream at him/her when i reply (aka using caps)? and i dont see the point in this message too  i dont see what is the argument or point youre trying to drive at? many people in this server also tell me to familiarise myself with vector formulas to use  and i am just merely and simply just doing what i have been constantly reminded of  anyway you are the one taking the exam  if you cant memorise and/or understand vector formulas or you get confuse with it  it isnt the fault of anyone’s in this server cuz we have been simply reminding you things to take note  my reminder is just that extra nudge to be careful and take note. if the message pisses you off  noone forces you to view this message or pop into this channel  and noone forced or coerced you to reply. i dont see why i am controlled of what i can say and what i cannot say even though the material in that message is just a reminder  a nudge  or whatever synonyms of a similar value and tone you wish to replace with. and tbh what is your argument? such vague comments and opinions yet drive negligible value. you can reply me in dms or in a’s. i wish to not flood this channel with anything unrelated or stir anything in this channel or server.,btohqsg
