You can call DBS to tell them to see if they can change to Visa.I didn't put in the promo code  then after that  they honoured the promo code for the extra miles.,btohqsg

Online transactions wont affect. But for transportation tapping depends if your card can earn any rewards/cashback from tapping the physical card. Eg UOB ONE can but UOB evol doesnt.Another benefit about supp card is you and your mum will be able to keep track of the transactions of the supp card on the bankâ€™s app  so its easier to differentiate which are her spendings and which is yours if you need to.,btohqsg
