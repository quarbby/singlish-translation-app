Mans on the TYS grind 💪💪,btohqsg
Gotta do what I can! 😭,btohqsg

Uhh hope you get the grade you want ... my tys grinding went over expectations getting me pfp admission after n levels 😅😅,btohqsg
Wow  good for you man  I'm just tryna survive out here.,btohqsg
I'm not from SG  no idea what's up with O levels and A levels,btohqsg
A level is for university entry,btohqsg
O level is for senior high school equivalent entry,btohqsg
GCE A levels syllabus. That's what it says on the official website.,btohqsg
Like is just constant tys painful grinding and practices ... my weakest used to be math if I recall correctly,btohqsg

Hi I'd like to get some advice.. admin do let me know if this is the right place to ask yea?My cousin is in VJC year 1 currently  but the travelling journey to school is like 2 hours  it's really taking a toll on her health. Besides  her teacher is not really teaching much  mostly going through tutorials like practice questions or hmrk  my cousin has to learn every content by herself online. She tried to transfer to nearer JC  like ACJC  but the appeal period ended 1 month ago. So if next year she is still in Vjc  she is considering to apply as a Private candidate so she can cut down on the travelling time.Does anyone of you know the implication of being a private candidate? Will this affect her A level  and her application to Uni? What's your advice?,btohqsg
private candidate got no school resources lor that's about it,btohqsg
and u pay for the exam fees yourself,btohqsg
So is she going to leave VJC in Y2? You cannot be a school and private candidate at once.,btohqsg
Yea if can apply for private candidate  she ll leave the vjc i think,btohqsg
Oh.. then will she still get the school certificate to show that she has legit schooling years?,btohqsg
Make sure she stays until she gets her PW Cert as she will need that,btohqsg
so she won't get a grad cert,btohqsg
hmm how about just skip sch fr some/ mostof the tutorials since her teacher isnt teaching much.,btohqsg
she only got a level cert from SEAB,btohqsg
But that's enough for admission for local unis,btohqsg
this tbh just skip school and go thr for exams,btohqsg
well ya but her qns is sch cert,btohqsg
a level cert from SEAB  yes will get,btohqsg
PW cert is project work certificate right? Currenrly her year1 has pw  so if she stays until year1 is over  she will get that cert without continuing with year 2 right?,btohqsg
Ah yeah if it's the School Graduation cert she won't get that,btohqsg
Yes but she needs to stay until that's issued,btohqsg
just need to go back and take the cert no?,btohqsg
