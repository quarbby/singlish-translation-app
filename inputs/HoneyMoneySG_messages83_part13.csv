if buy iphone at shop use the citi reward card hit 800 is it can get the complimentary reward at singsaverÔºü if buy iphone,btohqsg
should be. Can use Amaze+citi rewards mc to get 4mpd also,btohqsg
How long does uob credit card show out the card on app? Successful yesterday but still doesn't show the card in app.,btohqsg
one business day for appinstantly on desktop banking website,btohqsg
Yes I also eventually going to do this.,btohqsg
Yesterday was Sunday. Maybe check again later. At most wait till tomorrow?,btohqsg
To add on  1 week for physical,btohqsg
Ah okay! Maybe need wait tomorrow then can add to gpay üëå,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sorry can I check with you is it possible to waived off the annual fee for POSB Everyday cards üí≥?,btohqsg
Can  if you use it regularly,btohqsg
I plan to use it on Sheng Song grocery shopping üõí only,btohqsg
If you want to get the cashback then you'll be buying $800 worth of groceries from Sheng Siong every month..,btohqsg
Sheng Siong no minimum spend required,btohqsg
maybe you're thinking of citi cb 8% instead,btohqsg
but ya  uhm 200 not much. Can always try  if they reject cancel the card lor,btohqsg
Can try. I just saw someone's post saying they only spend $200 every month and able to get waiver. If digibot fail to give waiver just cancel lor,btohqsg
Good idea üëçüèª. Can I ask you a question üôãüèª free one year annual fee mean if next year Posb don‚Äôt let me waive off I can cancel the card and don‚Äôt have to pay anything right ?,btohqsg
Ya  your annual fee payment is always for the upcoming year,btohqsg
Oh do take note that for everyday card  they give their own points called daily $ and not direct cashback  so u have to manually redeem (offset paylah  credit card bill). Weird system but oh well,btohqsg
I haven't spent on this card for 4  5 years also can get waiver each year. Don't think they decide  or only decide by spending per month.,btohqsg
I think DBS is most forgiving for annual fee waivers,btohqsg
what about uob  I have ppv but I haven‚Äôt used it whole 2023 because it is not applicable for one account bonus interest üò¢,btohqsg
But that‚Äôs for 2nd year onwards  correct?,btohqsg
Yeah. Agree.. I think I got a POSB card for more than 10 years. Never made any spending on this card ever since I gotten the card. (It came with another credit card which I applied). The bank also waived the fee every year.,btohqsg
I think the most unforgiving one is OCBC,btohqsg

For public transport via Apple Pay  which card is the best ah? I have HSBC revo  Citibank Rewards  DBS world women master üôèüèª,btohqsg
none will reap 4mpd for simplygo. only the smallest possible mpd for those cards. you can consider using the evol card (CB) for public transport.,btohqsg
Okok thanks  reading through the search  I think UOB one card is possible? Although it‚Äôs not a miles card,btohqsg
can according to the website. apologies as i do not own the UOB one card üòÖ,btohqsg
Uob one effective CB is lower than evol unless 80-100% of your transaction falls within acb merchant.,btohqsg
Sorry what does acb stands for?,btohqsg
Hi this webull promo too good to be true ? Transfer from other broker usd25000 of shares and get  free 2k Tsla shares,btohqsg

if you busy and didn't manage to claim within the claim period then too bad,btohqsg
Must maintain the assets for 360 days also,btohqsg
Hi guys  if I spent $500 from my UOB one account to invest in SNACK. Does it count as eligible spending ?,btohqsg
Hi  just a quick question here.If i maxed out my Lady's Card on the travel category already  would i be able to get 4mpd with UOB PPV?,btohqsg
hi all  would yall recommend fcy spending for meals and groceries (e.g. in jb) using hsbc revolutions? would love to hear some opinions :),btohqsg
It is insurance mcc  suppose excluded,btohqsg
@O010stOp_98se_ndingsh_80643it188probably meant the spend requirement on the account  which in theory should qualify (assuming SNACK uses insurance MCC),btohqsg
Note the part on no card rewards though,btohqsg
If you are paying online with PPV  only whitelisted MCCs can get 4mpd.,btohqsg
Yes. It will qualify for UOB one ACCOUNT spending requirements  but not for cashback  miles or points,btohqsg
Kind of an old news already ü§î,btohqsg
