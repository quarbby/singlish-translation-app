@cauchycriteriondo you have tys for fm,btohqsg
Use promo papers and what not,btohqsg
@chemcerShould I explain what I said in O-level chat? TBH I think the question while loaded feels very wrong.Like I understand the question/answer will be very obvious and have a clear answer if say  you consider the space of all normal distributions.But if you consider the space of ALL DISTRIBUTIONS then boi gg you are in for a rough ride,btohqsg
Student's t at 2 degrees of freedom has infinite variance,btohqsg
TBH I didn't check the Student's t PDF but it should be fine,btohqsg
I integrated both the student t PDF as well as the Norm Dist PDFs becase uhhh  not much other easy way to get the CDF,btohqsg
You can see that the infinite variance curve has steeper CDF near 0,btohqsg
I rather not tell O-level students about infinite variance curves though,btohqsg
Another thing is obviously I can play with the variance of the normal distribution to make it look as steep/non-steep as I like  relatively speaking,btohqsg
But all real numbers are less than infinity,btohqsg
I assume the only possibility is that *there A L W A Y S* exists intersection points between the two CDFs  but I can't be bothered to prove it,btohqsg
Proving the existence should be easier than showing/solving for it at least  but it's nonlinearity means urghhhh...,btohqsg
production quality on this is üëåüëåüëå,btohqsg
