The downside is the long charging time but the driver behaviour will have to adopt,btohqsg
Meaning to say plan on the road trips,btohqsg
Good mix of micro EVs and bigger ICE cars,btohqsg
The fair thing is that they can afford to own more than one cat a/b vehicles,btohqsg
I charge at work or home,btohqsg
Everything in life is on planning anyway,btohqsg
ahh understand where you coming from now. but this is only for crossovers and suv leh,btohqsg
"Top selling ""crossover"" in March and q1 2022",btohqsg
ev is great but i think no matter how popular tesla is  wonâ€™t be too latrust me  i like tesla too but not the most affordable to the mainstream chinese market still,btohqsg
when it comes to this PCC  I tend to take a more erm spontaneous approach.,btohqsg
right maybe miscomm cos u state here best selling car in china ma,btohqsg
U donâ€™t charge full   u charge till 80-90,btohqsg
Like it or not  ev will be a must to get,btohqsg
this is a bit marketing I think... overseas many are taxis.,btohqsg
not that it is bad don't get me wrong. they are good for what they do.,btohqsg
Since you're driving EV  I would actually like to know how much Tesla SG is charging for battery pack replacement should your battery die for any reason or age,btohqsg
Now just have to wait for more incentives to adopt,btohqsg
To me if got landed   ev is the best la for city driving   Eletricity is cheap   easy maintain   1 pedal driving,btohqsg
Incentives will slowly go down though  governments need to earn lost revenue on fuel also,btohqsg
Works best for landed as they probably recharge for free using solar,btohqsg
I tell you easiest car to maintain  Mazda 3!!!!,btohqsg
Isn't there a really long warranty period on the battery?,btohqsg
No pedal driving also can! The adaptive cruise control,btohqsg
there is the upfront cost of installing panels to consider too.,btohqsg
Ice car so many things to maintain,btohqsg
8 years but to them not enough,btohqsg
if we consider % of folks living in landed properties vs apartments  we should seriously look at the charging infrastructure,btohqsg
Also have horror stories of people with first gen model S and X saying that Tesla isn't holding up the warranty,btohqsg
Everything in black and white sue them lol,btohqsg
Yeah I think 8-10 is really good. EV also good for those ppl whose office can install charger.Or wait until gov allow wall plug style chargers even tho that takes forever to charge,btohqsg
Doesn't leave a good taste mah,btohqsg
First ev experience  need to sue here to sue there,btohqsg
I am a petrol head   after drive ev I never look back,btohqsg
It's so nice to drive too  I tried getgo's kona  shiok,btohqsg
Easy to drive   easy to maintain,btohqsg
Power delivery like a motorcycle too  so high torque,btohqsg
Now coal head technically? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ But good man! You are able to get what you love!,btohqsg
My tesla been recall just need to down load need update,btohqsg
Lol   ice is go back to ad lmao,btohqsg
Just that the power dies down after a while with lesser power on the top end,btohqsg
So far we all think our car is too fast,btohqsg
All the cars like not moving,btohqsg
That one I feel in ICE also,btohqsg
because all drive like you.. floor or nothing,btohqsg
Haven't got to try what's the power band like vs ICE,btohqsg
A lot to do with reaction time and how hard you floor it,btohqsg
What car u drive ? Max Lauren 720?,btohqsg
Obviously not as fast as you ev freaks mah,btohqsg
All floor off traffic light here and there,btohqsg
is that what driving EV is about.. deriving pleasure from beating people at traffic lights?,btohqsg
