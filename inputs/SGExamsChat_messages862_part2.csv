Otherwise if not urgent you wait for Apple do Back to School program see whether they bundle AirPods or what not,btohqsg

A levels cert ppl say not useful in employment   not sure how true is that ... many students opt for Poly instead to get employment after graduation directly,btohqsg
Regardless I find jc students having easier time entering university though ... due to obvious reasons out there,btohqsg
yes  A level cert is practically useless.,btohqsg
Only use is for entering university,btohqsg

You know what is more controversial,btohqsg
Them putting yijc logo and calling it rejuvenated,btohqsg
Yall that yijc building is just the old ijc building but with a new logo,btohqsg
The question is why do people want to go into employment so early ?,btohqsg
Imo  SG do not need many people with poly skillets  we need many people with high level of skill sets like intelligent in math  sciences etc as we are a small nation so we do not need as many siill based workers as let's say the UK,btohqsg
Poly is a good system but implemented in the wrong country,btohqsg
Is the number of people lived in our countries,btohqsg
One instance is foreign talent   imagine all of them suddenly leave SG  then we are rip. We need Singaporeans to replace them and the skill sets needed for replacement is not what poly can teach,btohqsg
It's the trade off between money   experience and a higher qualification,btohqsg
Actually it's because our sg population getting lesser..but don't forget the hard truth..more foreigners are also coming to sg to work. For eg. 1000 seats into poly. 800 foreigners.. national exam have bell curve,btohqsg
You think poly will not tighten the belt? Jc also,btohqsg
i think harder to get in,btohqsg
Then followed by N /O/ A,btohqsg
Imo  the skills set possess by foreign talent is only something that can be taught mainly in Unis and a good prep for unis are JCs not polys,btohqsg
Of course this is dependent on industry .,btohqsg
Nah its getting easier . Many will think it's harder as we are brought up in a system where exam results are the essence. Good exam results == good   bad exam results == bad and that will be the sole determinant of admissions .,btohqsg
But then with all of these changes   the mindset have to shift from exams only to exams+ ECs with exams decreasing in importance due to lesser subjects needed and thus less time needed for exams .,btohqsg
So students have to concentrate on ECs which they are not used to (unfortunately),btohqsg
Well there is the ongoing debate about standardised test vs holistic test admissions into university,btohqsg
My answer still standardised test may not be the perfect answer but it is still the best uh,btohqsg
