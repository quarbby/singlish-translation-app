Because using car to do good seem not very convenient in parking leh,btohqsg
oh  means you actually did complete the job with no issues but somehow after that it reflects cancelled?,btohqsg
Never do the job... Never even relaised I had such a job,btohqsg
I never even click complete job... Again I never know I had such a job.,btohqsg
In fact on that day  my first job was 10.40am...,btohqsg
This one 10am. I haven't touch my handphone  still doing my office work.,btohqsg
Hi good evening all so far I have done total 8 trips average add up each trip get back $17 plus if count by hrs think each hr get back only $7 most it's it still worth it?,btohqsg
Btw  I tried to sent asking them to review if there is any conversations w regards to these. I just sent today... I am very sure I did not request cancellation nor even aware I have this job at hand.,btohqsg
Really very tiring just do 2 trips only from 11 am to ard 3 pm plus,btohqsg
$7 not worth lah. But kills time. Y notm,btohqsg
today start my first car job  take  1 hrs to complete  after commission $19.xx  2 car park about $3 loading place take six boxes (customer never mention trolley)   after reach customer say need trolley   and go back car park take with no lift direct to carpark   customer  say have to go by escalator ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
2 trips if count by hr 1 hr only $7 plus,btohqsg
is the fare too leee or I too noob üòÇ,btohqsg
Yah each trip will take abt an hr to and fro,btohqsg
My plan is go somewhere that is on the same way after complete a job,btohqsg
If more than 20kg you can ask for Mpv rate,btohqsg
So after complete a job just wait and saw,btohqsg
It's the season  extra surcharge for cny just over...so now  hahaha kill time  can lah. Along the way  can lah. Double job can lah. Otherwise  it's very tiring for little money  and car maintenance.,btohqsg
Focus on car job only lah.,btohqsg
If motor job car can take also yah,btohqsg
Peak 11-1pm. Still okey lah. Otherwise  I dun bother... Focus on car job  with good locations... Otherwise body maintenance is more worth it.,btohqsg
Cash out after Sunday only get the money next Wed yah,btohqsg
If cash out before 2359 hrs Sunday will get following Wednesday yah?,btohqsg
So far I feel even do 2 to 3 trips a day if really got nothing to do also like not really worth it,btohqsg
For the time and effort somemore feel tired already after only 2 trips that took almost a day already,btohqsg
For grab food delivery cars they will give only near your location and also first come first serve basis?,btohqsg
They give you. You just accept,btohqsg
You dun accept  u will be penalised with low acceptance rate.. disqualify from some of their perks..,btohqsg
Means cannot like lalamove can choose?,btohqsg
But they give to the relatively nearest rider to the shop.,btohqsg
So for lalamove multiple stops I see some even got 8 stops in between that's crazy,btohqsg
Hi I need assistance. I ask live chat to cancel 1 order from 53 ubi to sin ming however without my knowledge after live chat cancel they reasign me an order without my consent. Now it's still ongoing. Try contact live chat no avail. What should I do,btohqsg
I'm unsure as I'm new with lalamove,btohqsg
Can you share the fare breakdown?,btohqsg
Do u include the time u spend tryg to get jobs,btohqsg
Relax know that complain also won't change anytg 1,btohqsg
Not worth it to get angry,btohqsg
I realised that 3 mths after I started,btohqsg
Now I just do wat I can  everything else I f*** itüòÇ,btohqsg
Cos they so many drivers minority complain they can't b bothered,btohqsg
Same pick up same delivery location,btohqsg
Have to learn to stack in lalamove. Won't break $10/hr doing one at a time. If don't want to stack  doing grabfood or panda will give a better hourly rate - the per-job pay is lower but much shorter  so the hourly is higher.,btohqsg
Knn Extra Virgin pizza @ Asia Sq there really fucked up. Monitor our gps movement and keep calling when we on the road. Deliver within allocated timing also end up kanna bad rating and soft ban from Oddle. ü§¨ü§¨,btohqsg
Nxt time don't take their jobs lor. Last time I take their job. Even when accepted the job liao they will call and ask me what time I can reach etc. After that I nvr take their job liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt know they‚Äôre like that. Prev take also no such issue. Now I know already will not take theirs anymore. Same pattern like WaaCow nearby there also ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Not all the time like that I guess. But once awhile is enoughüòÇ,btohqsg
Can take for stack If u drop theirs first lor. Or take as single job,btohqsg
When LLM raising our rates?? ü§î,btohqsg
Waa cow as well. Monitor our GPS. I once stacked an order with theirs and deliver the other one first. The guy from waacow keep calling. Subsequently he rated me 1 star and I emailed lalamove to remove it.,btohqsg
Most likely is they got complaint from their customers  over oddle delivery.  So their management implement loElse f&b ops alr quite bz  got spare time catch Netflix in toilet better  who want to monitor some gps,btohqsg
