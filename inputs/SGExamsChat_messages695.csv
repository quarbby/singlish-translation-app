Straight up only do mcq for P2,btohqsg

Shld be able to clear criteria oen,btohqsg
It will save you the pain of h1 Chinese if you go to jc,btohqsg
I regret not deliberately flunking Chinese in sec sch so that I could‚Äôve directly taken CLB in jc,btohqsg
Well yeah I failed h1 cl,btohqsg
Also cos Chinese is the only subject I saw the U on my cert,btohqsg
Else it would‚Äôve been no cert,btohqsg
Oh ya Chinese result in Feb,btohqsg
If you got S and above why bother,btohqsg
Is there criteria to take hcl in sec sch,btohqsg
HCL can hit criteria as long as you finish the paper,btohqsg
You copy wholesale also can pass,btohqsg
Then why might need to tho,btohqsg
and then because alot ip ppl not using olvl grade to go to jcs so hcl they d7 and above happy alr,btohqsg
I might had been genuinely fucked,btohqsg
Enough to get somewhere can le,btohqsg
Cant be as bad as mine,btohqsg

I dun think anyone would unless they confident their mt will do btr than their h1 subj,btohqsg
It's damn fucking hard to fail one,btohqsg
To fail exp chi it means,btohqsg
i scared fail retake  fail again and then need do 3 yrs,btohqsg

U legit legit can't give a fuck,btohqsg
If U can roughly talk to coffeeshop auntie,btohqsg

My spoken can somewhat make it,btohqsg
Cuz I do speak at home,btohqsg
Cuz it's a way bigger component,btohqsg
for CL is the easiest to top in writtenüòè,btohqsg
I feel only spoken chi is useful in sg context,btohqsg
If uw work in china or w Chinese business,btohqsg
That one diff story ah obv,btohqsg
in y3 the first cl wa like 60% of the cohort failed,btohqsg
i was crying cause i got 38/40 (changed the correct answer to a wrong one),btohqsg
btw i cant say this in the Discord Will get scolded to death,btohqsg
this is why i took h2 hist and not h2 cll,btohqsg
But confirm not nice if it's like U kaopeh to Ur friends abt it,btohqsg
I only complain to like someone who also got A*,btohqsg
how dare you complain about your grades,btohqsg
If the person fail alr i wont even tell my grades bruv,btohqsg
I don't comment on how ez I feel a paper is anym,btohqsg
They won't get mad at me one,btohqsg
Generally my personal principle is that im only gonna complain about shit marks to someone who did better,btohqsg
Or like my friend who rly don't mind me,btohqsg
im more interested in h2 history and im not interested in the non-lit component of cll,btohqsg
"Yea same if ppl ask i js say "" it was ok/manageable""",btohqsg
percentage for nonlit part is quite low,btohqsg

If U can somewhat form full sentences,btohqsg
And roughly know what to write,btohqsg
I write like I speaking liddat,btohqsg

I wish I had gotten D7 for o levels,btohqsg
Then jc I could‚Äôve taken clb directly,btohqsg
I actually tried appealing to moe to just let me take clb in my first jc year but they reject,btohqsg
Thanks to them I wasted one more year,btohqsg
can i say  tht is the SG context for CL is too easy(?),btohqsg
that's why i topped for Hcl,btohqsg
not to be racist but is india  wat r u expecting?,btohqsg
Apparantly u can get raped in thr metaverse,btohqsg

Yeah I was reading up on it,btohqsg
Someone got sexually harassed and traymatised on VR or smth,btohqsg

Being a hellhole of a site,btohqsg

TIL obama was in office for 2 terms lol,btohqsg
Issok. In the world of multiverses  you are the CO  BMTC in one of the universes,btohqsg
i know someone genius got ungraded for oral,btohqsg
oh shit chatgpt can do dy/dx,btohqsg
tbh idk what will i get if my oral was not same topic as my prelim,btohqsg
mine was the classic environment lmao,btohqsg
got i got merit but somehow i think i prolly failed p1 / 2  still D overall,btohqsg
i know someone who actually got that....,btohqsg
I think in the last 50 years  only 3 POTUS served just one term: Jimmy Carter  George Bush and Donald Trump ‚Ä¶ though Trump is standing for election this year,btohqsg
i got a merit just coz it was same topic as my prelims,btohqsg
but if i had a pass for oral  i may end up failing overall,btohqsg
oh and i remembered our chinese cher made a report about the invigilator,btohqsg
oooo  i only knew abt obama in like 2016 after his term ended,btohqsg
maybe that is how a merit came about,btohqsg
coz like most of us complain that the invigilator was just staring straight in our eyes throughout iirc,btohqsg
rawr  went for a 3d printing workshop kinda hosted by my schs design cca,btohqsg
then how does someone get ungraded,btohqsg
The fact that he is the Republican nominee ‚Ä¶ and that it is Biden vs Trump once again is rather ü§° imho,btohqsg
i mean the others dont really have a presence  alot of ppl see ol joe as shld be retiring,btohqsg
not my design just they printed before hand,btohqsg
They are only 3 years apart. I don‚Äôt get the age issue. It‚Äôs a lot got to do with how media is portraying them,btohqsg
ok la in case u are wondering  it was my bro who got ungraded,btohqsg
oh damm  tho do you think there wld be other better suited candidates that are running?,btohqsg
been out of the loop for awhile lol,btohqsg
my bro now needa suffer with H1 chinese lmao,btohqsg
Too late to discuss since Republican primaries left with Donald Trump vs Nikki Haley and Trump is crushing Haley,btohqsg
Hello r we talking abt tables rn,btohqsg
Barring legal persecution  it will be DT vs JB,btohqsg
A drop of water and BOOMS,btohqsg
oh ya what was going on with trump when sum states said he cldnt run or smth?,btohqsg
Some states tried to remove him from the ballots citing constitution which says that a person who has sworn to take office but involved in insurrection is barred from presidential election ‚Ä¶ and DT‚Äôs involvement in 6 Jan is pretty damningBut the Supreme Court had already rejected that case  saying that DT needs to be first convicted by the Congress before it can be determined if he is disqualified,btohqsg

It was a 9-0 vote by the Supreme Court justices ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
idk y he want to run again. js like retire alr lah,btohqsg
Conspiracy says ‚Ä¶ he runs so he can get himself out of prospects of jail,btohqsg
His supporters started generating AI images of him hanging out with African Americans to help him improve his image within that demographicQuite funny. Go google and read,btohqsg
he shld retire with all the ice cream he wants. till uk he kena diabetes or smtg,btohqsg
as of his health summary 2023. he doesn't have diabetes,btohqsg
eh u talkig trump or biden,btohqsg
dh diabetes but got alot of other health probs,btohqsg
thts why ice cream  cuz he like ice cream,btohqsg
Haha I have my political opinion but I‚Äôm gonna stay out of this conversation already,btohqsg
usa politics is js a bunch of clowns,btohqsg
I guess it‚Äôs to quell naysayers,btohqsg
Jimmy Kimmel  TDS  Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and SNL won‚Äôt be funny without the politics,btohqsg
If udk jimmel Kimmel I have no words,btohqsg
only you're able to do that,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/_m4JMTixTTM?feature=sharedJust watch this episode. John Oliver is da man. He has my respect siah,btohqsg
Nsf can queue for bto or sth,btohqsg
like younger couples can deposit a smaller percentage of money,btohqsg
Watch till the end and see what Oliver pushed one of the justices to do,btohqsg
Aren‚Äôt u < 25 % his age?,btohqsg
Oh. Go read the recent Alabama Supreme Court ruling on frozen embryos being considered children,btohqsg
Hahahaha this is not the main story. The main story is the real deal ‚Äî how Oliver taunted a supreme justice to resign,btohqsg
oh my cher also mentioned him lol,btohqsg
His show has really insightful analysis but it‚Äôs US contextBut you can see what kind of questions are being asked and how balanced arguments can be presented,btohqsg
Good right. I‚Äôm so glad full episodes of his shows are released starting this season,btohqsg
It is! it is from the US perspective but can see how follow-up questions are being asked,btohqsg
I think COVID times it was quite plain ‚Ä¶ but I am loving this season so far. His most recent episode is on Boeing planes and it‚Äôs quite something to learn about the organisation with more detail,btohqsg
He actually had the audacity to remind the justice two episodes later that the offer still has two weeks left,btohqsg
I salute him. That explains his amazing winning streak at the Emmy Awards,btohqsg
This  in my opinion  actually adds insult,btohqsg
Sorry let me start a mini rant,btohqsg
So my mum now talking to my bro about pw,btohqsg
Like again telling him what not to do etc,btohqsg
Then she i think purposely go say ‚Äòplease dun say do an app  it is the most stupid solution‚Äô,btohqsg
Coz that was what i did,btohqsg
why your mum so worried lol,btohqsg
Basically indirectly saying i did the wrong thing,btohqsg
Im not the only one in the grp,btohqsg
U think i hv power to control the grp,btohqsg
She said ‚Äòbut u failed hcl what  it is possible to fail‚Äô,btohqsg
Now she just telling him what not to do,btohqsg
failing hcl vs failing pw is so different lol,btohqsg
My dad blamed me for joining in the family talk to spike my unhappiness,btohqsg
But i cant shut my ears,btohqsg
And tbh till now he dun understand what im unhappy abt,btohqsg
He said i need see a psychologist,btohqsg
Bruh if someone fail the pw  i seriously no comments,btohqsg
typical asian parents‚Ä¶If u don‚Äôt talk to them: So rude  why you ignore your parentsIf u talk to them: How dare u talk back to me???,btohqsg
Ultimately you'd wanna take things not personal at the end of the day,btohqsg
I literally told my mum ‚Äòit is so hard to talk to u‚Äô,btohqsg
I mean that's what I'd do,btohqsg
Then afterwards  she just has not talked to me,btohqsg
I mean maybe she's reflecting on it,btohqsg
My dad said ‚Äòparents dun owe children anything‚Äô,btohqsg
Sometimes I feel like adults don't always have everything figured out,btohqsg
that's like imo one of it ah if it's uk,btohqsg
The thing is like no one understands my true feelings,btohqsg
Ya I mean so what lol,btohqsg
And my dad can tell me ‚Äòi also not happy mummy keep spoiling baby (referring to my younger sis) coz she is a baby‚Äô,btohqsg
And he told me ‚Äòthere is also somethings im not happy w my mother‚Äô,btohqsg
guys do you think ppl r gonna fail pw,btohqsg
Who knows like their first child is idk the so called prototype and ^,btohqsg
btw if you fail y5 pw y6 you have a mini pw that is you do urself,btohqsg
At least you're not bottling it up uk,btohqsg
Gotta get it outta your system,btohqsg
I hate it that my aunt saving her ass,btohqsg
Say ‚Äòur mum was going through a hard time when (my autistic brother) is having tantrum issues‚Äô,btohqsg
honestly Ill admit it   I do kinda unds like it's hard to not hear it but I'd like to think we live in dystopian world and w sm shit happening ard us  its just a survival thing from time to time,btohqsg
can you change to clb after first round of chinese o lvl papers?,btohqsg
They're like in a very irreversible phase,btohqsg
cause uk they're just liddat at that pt,btohqsg
very unpleasant to hear but not say it's wrong to still even be hopeful for miracles or changes,btohqsg
and that one of the shits that makes life in general fun/int/wtv,btohqsg
Ya it is true but tbh some parents alr let lose in jc,btohqsg
I think there is a criteria to meet,btohqsg
???? That doesn't mean her behaviour is justified,btohqsg
True that  as much as i hope  it wun happen,btohqsg
you‚Äôve been doing the same thing again and again with the fighting and arguing,btohqsg
has that ever worked out for you,btohqsg
my parents gave up in like y3,btohqsg
tbh you can argue they gave up since y1,btohqsg
Aiya rlly focus more on yourself for now uk,btohqsg
Cause they also dont know how to interfere,btohqsg
Right‚Ä¶i will take it that they are sisters so i guess i cant do anything,btohqsg
little things in life matter uk make yourself happy   reward and self-regulate,btohqsg
They dont even know what subjects i taking even after i told them,btohqsg
But they dont mind as long as its like a legitmate field of study,btohqsg
My parents was initially against what i applied,btohqsg
Like i think i want to study humans courses they wont oppose also,btohqsg
Tbh i only fought when u get mad at something,btohqsg
I did not consult them about that coz i knew the only combination im gonna take,btohqsg
yea but internally the emotions you feel i‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a constant cycle again and again,btohqsg
I also nvr consult i just informed,btohqsg
even if you don‚Äôt express it,btohqsg
only qn my dad asked is why not econ,btohqsg
Then my dad was like ‚Äòu like mad girl  u need to think through first and not say everything coz u not unhappy about something‚Äô,btohqsg
And after i explained he was like oh okay,btohqsg
Meanwhile idk why my bro even take ages to think bio or phy,btohqsg
Maybe i should hv done that for my cca,btohqsg
Wonder if they will write to the sch‚Äôs cca cher to kick me out,btohqsg
Wait if you didnt join band in jc what did you join/genuine,btohqsg
Tbh i feel like the sch wont entertain,btohqsg
Cause is not like you are doing any illegal or against sch rules stuff,btohqsg
Then what did she end up joining,btohqsg
Tmjc will? Idk about other sch but dhs prob wont,btohqsg
What in the dysfunctional confrontational bs,btohqsg
I thought she didnt join band because the parents want her to focus on studiesThen shooting is more low commitment ?,btohqsg
Ngl i think those parents are teacher worst nightmare,btohqsg
Cause like some parents are all talk but not scary,btohqsg
Then some is like really keesiao,btohqsg
He think im being unreasonable and now say i better settle stuff and apologise to my mother  it is not healthy,btohqsg
I wonder sia‚Ä¶i remembered the band cher come convince me join,btohqsg
It is because in sec sch my training was (to them) taking a lot of my time  then they say my o lvl result shit  they worried i will fail A levels,btohqsg
Coz my sec sch niche in performing arts,btohqsg
I mean...for me I'd know as long as I know I'm not in the wrong,btohqsg
Real‚Ä¶they actually did sth when my parents complain,btohqsg
like im in no position to say but uk old ppl just let them be ah,btohqsg
also old ppl don't like ‚ÄúÊ∞î‚Äú them,btohqsg
they are in fact the one who took care of us before,btohqsg
you don‚Äôt have to always prove you‚Äôre right,btohqsg
it's just you live in the same exact household,btohqsg
Consider it as doing yourself a favour too,btohqsg
you still kinda depend on them to live uk lol in the meantime just play along,btohqsg
When you earn a stable income and adult stuff ig you can gtfo then and there,btohqsg
for me it‚Äôs let them be who they are so you can do the same,btohqsg
if the household is rlly that toxic ykwim,btohqsg
And they hv this tendency to look down on the younger generation,btohqsg
Ofc I'm just say say only ah lol take it w a pinch of salt too,btohqsg
Oh yea i think i will be more coherent if i write down things,btohqsg
Lmao‚Ä¶the fact that idk how even did it reach the principalüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Like seriously i was put in a v awkward position during j1 ptc,btohqsg
Like r U saying that cuz U econs lol,btohqsg
Nah for me I see it as it is,btohqsg
smack myself w the reality and go aite,btohqsg
It's just diff era hence diff mindsets,btohqsg
it's prob just that hard for them to comprehend us like how we find it hard to communicate ourselves to them,btohqsg
Mine is not the type to probe u,btohqsg
Mines the type you have to speak up and voice out,btohqsg
cuz bo bian uk diff kinda upbringing also,btohqsg
They're thrown into the outside world and left to fend for themselves and believe that them doing that to me and my bro is kinda acceptable   lol I mean sure it is reasonable physically but emotionally I think not,btohqsg
I like that and they complain i lean more towards friend‚Äôs advice,btohqsg
Then they be like ‚Äòok next time u dun ask me anything‚Äô,btohqsg
But which parent will in front of me tell cher ‚Äòcan u do something  she dun care about gp‚Äô,btohqsg
I cant rmb exact words but something along these lines,btohqsg
I cant remember how my cher responded,btohqsg
My dad was like ‚Äòcan u please give her more gp homework  like newspaper to read‚Äô,btohqsg
Then i just shouted back at my dad,btohqsg
because my dad used to make me read newspaper and write a summary of one article i read everyday,btohqsg
and that was already in secondary school,btohqsg
back at that age  i couldnt see it,btohqsg
but now  yeah it lowkey was,btohqsg
ok primary school is kinda insane LOL,btohqsg
my parents shld have signed me up for kumon since kindergarden  goddamit,btohqsg
ya any1 here remember little red dot? uk those parctices at the back? i nvr did them i oni liked reading the articles,btohqsg

i was a weird kid who liked to read newspapers,btohqsg
but i was more of a reader's digest person,btohqsg
my p4 cher banned me frm reading readers digest in sch,btohqsg
im a Chicken soup for the soul,btohqsg
didnt get my first gaming console until i was sec 3,btohqsg
and i bought it with my own money,btohqsg
haha funni. i also like tht,btohqsg

luckily my parents quite generous lol,btohqsg
i have no idea why they allowed me to buy a pc at sec 1,btohqsg
with my results i would have slapped that bastard,btohqsg
we a got wii like 2 yrs ago it was 2nd hand. the first gaming console i ever had,btohqsg
I'll be more careful next time FORGIVE ME üòîüòî,btohqsg

my teacher just look at me  and no comments...,btohqsg
ah shit here we go again,btohqsg

Given that trump will almost definitely be the nominee now  Biden should drop out and let someone like Michelle Obama replace him. Else it‚Äôll just be trump vs Biden  and more likely than not trump will win,btohqsg
What ur sch doin at sentosa?,btohqsg
Fml my eyes is repelling my body again,btohqsg
Hmmm are you saying our local media outlet is not trustworthy??? üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Haha as with all media outlets in the world. I guess we just gotta be mindful of any vested/conflict of interests as well as what information is worthy to think more deeply while what are kinda unimportant,btohqsg
only when i no longer m a part of bmtc they give that,btohqsg
Ahhh mb mb. I misread you. Issok. Wherever you are now  just close your eyes when you take bites of your cookhouse lunch and imagine it to be whatever pleases your buds best. Recite in your head ‚Äúanother day  another slay  ty big brother for the amazing food‚Ä¶‚Äù,btohqsg

Someone asked me about it and this dinosaur happened to have kept the article that was published in the chinese newspaper. RP for different schools back in 2001 when the max RP was 76,btohqsg
Bruh my friend idk keep telling me he breaking down wth,btohqsg
Im not a counsellor and i do hv my own problems to deal with,btohqsg
but if i am not wrong  their rp is calculated differently in the past,btohqsg
Yea but some ppl are easily swayed coz they didnt catch the vested interest,btohqsg
but on the bright side i can say my rp is higher than a raffles student rp in 2001. lol,btohqsg
20 + 20 + 20 (3 A level subjects  equiv to H2) + 8 (MTL) + 8 (GP),btohqsg
Tbf  ig it‚Äôs hard to detect vested and conflict of interests when the outlet doesn‚Äôt declare openly,btohqsg
U need to be against whatever their vested interest is to tell it out,btohqsg
"ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è MCCY announced that a new indoor arena will be built next to the S'pore Indoor Stadium to host more ""sophisticated events"".‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/3Tp0IbUFollow us on@mothershipsg",btohqsg
Hmmmm I‚Äôm not sure what you mean actually but I don‚Äôt think being against all that is presented = critical thinking. To me  it is impt to be reading from various sources and also broadly before forming opinions,btohqsg
Ah so u admitted skill issue,btohqsg
but I didn't understand anything about rpno need to also when all As except for GP and I only wanted electrical engineering.,btohqsg
Wow u are exactly 18 years older than me,btohqsg
Lmao‚Ä¶i just wanted that straight As too,btohqsg
That is all i hoped for in jc  im accepting nothing less seriously,btohqsg
It is just A  B  C etc,btohqsg
3 A lvl subjects 60 pointsEnglish max 8Chinese max 8,btohqsg
I was hoping for AAA/A and GP C,btohqsg
I wonder how they converted the OA grades to regular a level grades during the change to the H1/H2 system,btohqsg
And i actually got what i hopef for,btohqsg
so i should be considered 71/76,btohqsg
Seriously in my mind i will idk what if i scored anything less,btohqsg
Like is it A1>A  A2>B  B3>C  B4>D  C5 and C6 E,btohqsg
A1 and A2 becomes AB3 and B4 becomes Blike that lor,btohqsg
Im pretty sure it is not this,btohqsg
Coz my parents got B4 for gp,btohqsg
