Someone should design a bot just to flood chats,btohqsg
cause i rebuilt the entire bot,btohqsg
Your interesting is very ominous when punctuated,btohqsg
By this time everyone should know alr,btohqsg
Why not take a bank loan,btohqsg
How's everyone feeling after taking their results,btohqsg
Then you don’t have to be tied to the Government,btohqsg
I'll consider getting a student loan,btohqsg
Being tied to the government for awhile is not a bad thing,btohqsg
How will a math degree fund your loan,btohqsg
Being tied to the Government is better than not being tied to the Government when the global economy is on the downhill - and you don't know how it will be like when you graduate,btohqsg
In fact  it be a good thing. When you’re somebody govt deem worthy  private sector will be “green flag!”,btohqsg
Unless of course you have an economy crystal ball,btohqsg
Pls give me your economy crystal ball  I need it.,btohqsg
?????? How is Category Theory going to pay for itself,btohqsg
That's applied  and almost (actually  all) pure mathematicians hate applied mathematics.,btohqsg
Perhaps I should see my maths teachers for maths careers advice,btohqsg
I mean  if you’re really enjoying it  there’s no problem in being an academic,btohqsg
Lol then I assume they love money more than they love the only Dedekind-complete ordered field,btohqsg
Maybe one day “Insert realname here” will be on Math textbooks.,btohqsg
Yea but that’s for the PhD  he can still do Bachelor’s here.,btohqsg
TBH I don't see the problem of working as an academic overseas,btohqsg
And I don't mean only like fking top-tier magic like Oxbridge,btohqsg
I mean working in run-of-the-mill universities,btohqsg
Guys no matter what results y’all got  y’all should go ease and relax your mind first. Crying to yourself doesn’t help. Go look for your friends and family  have a meal or something. Do something you like! Maybe go out and get drunk if you like drinking  hahaLast year when I got my shitty results  I spent my night playing at Cow Play Cow Moo HAHAHA. Went home at around midnight. Felt a lot better after that. So just go free yourself today aites ! Nothing can be done to your results anymore so just move forward. For those who messed up  just do your best from here on ok!,btohqsg
US pay is probably better because many US people know how to make money in those positions,btohqsg
Eeyer don’t liddat leh. Don’t shame ppl for crying. I feel that it is valid to cry for one day. Then tmrw start planning your new way forward. We are not robots. We have emotions. Better to let it out than just swallow and hide it. Bad for mental health.,btohqsg
what no he’s saying dont be too upset HAHAH not shaming,btohqsg
I meant that you shouldn’t lock yourself in your room crying. Just cry it all out but don’t hurt yourself doing it. Let your fam cry with you also HAHAHA,btohqsg
No - it's because MIT professors know that they need to dig gold mines and only their pickaxes are trusted enough by gold mine owners,btohqsg
If your university (pickaxe) is not some Ivy League or historical name your pay likely won't be sky high either  and it'd possibly be very difficult to get consultantship fees,btohqsg
Easier to not worry about bullshit like Fracking (alternatively  magical Neural Network architectures) and worry about whether you can generalise relations between things,btohqsg
So in the end you chose?,btohqsg
But like wouldn’t it be sad for people that end up college single and college married to another college single by default?,btohqsg
Any history of college rejection? Hahaha,btohqsg
Interesting. Said nope to Japan and said YAAAS to Middle East.,btohqsg
You like exams??? Wait closed or open book?,btohqsg
But in poly you not study humans right?,btohqsg
H3 maths distinction is for scholars,btohqsg
More impt question is  did anyone your school get H3 DIST anything,btohqsg
Top science student got H3 Maths distinction,btohqsg
shit no more venti from you :(,btohqsg
I dunno what she is intending to do,btohqsg
Is ok I upgrade the deal for you,btohqsg
She's a foreigner so I dunno if she's able to apply for PSC,btohqsg
DIST only show nice nice only  it's pretty useless outside of SG unless you bullshit about it in US apps or whatever,btohqsg
i thought overseas unis look at H3s more,btohqsg
You can talk about your interest in furthering bla-bla with a H3 Dist,btohqsg
Some yes I'd assume most no,btohqsg
