Maybe you can just not make unnecessary comments?,btohqsg
MI has so many products like I said,btohqsg
Why being a clown for free lmao,btohqsg
Is it cause u Kena kick out from circus,btohqsg
Did seriously think there would not be a reaction for what you said?,btohqsg
Is just the grip too thin,btohqsg
I agree  should have used it for Maths.,btohqsg
The one I'm using is charged with Maths power,btohqsg
just being to exams auto score A,btohqsg
We take our h1s (except GP) in the same year as jc so ya LOL,btohqsg
JC is all about time management  discipline and motivation,btohqsg
you only need 1 secret weapon,btohqsg
At the end of the day   I won‚Äôt say either JC or MI is easy   they all each their own struggles   having one more year doesn‚Äôt mean you would do well   and at the same times doesn‚Äôt mean that you would be able to push through a longer period of stress and problemsBut there shouldn‚Äôt be a stigma towards MI   at the end of the day   we all still do A lvl  and that at the same one   being in MI doesn‚Äôt mean your weaker or what not. some people choose to come to MI just for commerce   some just wants that extra year   its not like oh what‚Äôs easy what‚Äôs not every diff subject have their own struggles   from sci to commerce to arts.For sci students   it‚Äôs stressful because of the how demanding some subjects can be   for arts and commerce too. There‚Äôs too much content   and limited time even if you are in MI.For JC u hv even lesser time   so I don‚Äôt see the point in having stigma because WE ALL ARE LITERALLY TRYING ALL OUR BEST,btohqsg
Is not like I‚Äôm bias or what not is just facts,btohqsg
Having 3 years is not easier   got two promos 4 exams a year and block test (in y3 ) and stuff,btohqsg
I taught MI for Physics Olympiad before,btohqsg
It's too far for me though,btohqsg
Occasionally I have MI students also. Very hardworking. So far those I encountered know what they want,btohqsg
MI accounting students come to uni and rekt the bell curve,btohqsg
Basic accounting is a useful subject to take in uni,btohqsg
It's one of those subjects that you won't see or understand the impact and usefulness when you are a student.,btohqsg
quite fun if law interests you,btohqsg
Hi  ex-MI student here. I don't think there's much necessarily to worry about  having graduated for three years already  I haven't necessarily seen any forms of stigma etc surrounding MI. Don't worry about it - if anything  people are generally impressed more so when MI students make it out of A levels with decent scores. To also add on  polytechnic students also consume three years  so in that sense  the stigma will lessen even more so.,btohqsg
time to pull mi geog Bellcurve up,btohqsg
principal of accounting a lvl version,btohqsg
Limpeh spot 2 years straight all come out,btohqsg
