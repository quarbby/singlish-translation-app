Hi admin and members. Can recommend me a card that give highest cashback for grab wallet top-up?,btohqsg
Only 1 card which is uob absolute cashback,btohqsg
My solution is use uob acb to top up grabpay wallet  then use hsbc ega to giro pay the bill of uob acb. Then you will get total 1.3% cashback on topping up grabpay wallet.,btohqsg
"Has anyone withdrawn SGD from IBKR recently? I noticed they stated a SGD40 ""Other Estimated Fees"". That's new and is it just a projection or was it really charged? Thanks!",btohqsg
Wow. 2 mths ago i did no such fee. But 1st withdrawal per mth is free anyway,btohqsg
Regulatory Disclosure and Receipt screen. After u do the verifications.,btohqsg
I chatting with IBKR now.. asking if that is just 'projected' to be charged by the recipient bank  or CONFIRMED will charge.,btohqsg
exactly  first time i am seeing too,btohqsg
ok expanded screenshot. TLDR: should be ok  just a cover S SGD40 fee stated. Should not really be charged.,btohqsg
sorry i had to censor the left bit.. user names,btohqsg
thanks for this.. guess they finally decided to cover their S for SGD withdrawals too,btohqsg
now I'm scared to put in another $4000 this month,btohqsg
SNACK is by NTUC.. i won't be worried about their credit worthinessbut it might be some technicalities like PAYNOW not done properly  account number error.. etc.,btohqsg
Don’t need to be scared so much la. If so scared don’t put In anything that uses the word ‘investing’. No one lied to you or force you put money saying capital guaranteed. Just wait another 7 days. You should get your momey in paynow,btohqsg
When you login to Snack  does the fund still showing value?,btohqsg
Hi  my due date for SC card is today and giro not deducted yet from EGA. It’s 6.30 pm alr  there’s no notification of any successful/unsuccessful giro. Anyone has similar experience?I trf in the funds to EGA today early morning,btohqsg
It stated 7 business days for withdrawal and they have exceeded their own timeframe but I’ll wait,btohqsg
SC deducted 1 day before this month for me. So you missed it yesterday. Pay via FAST,btohqsg
I see. Will this be the standard from now on? Coz in the past it was never like this,btohqsg
best to fund your EGA a bit earlier in the future. not worth to squeeze that 1-2 days of extra interest...for late fees headache,btohqsg
Hello admins and all  newbie here. can I ask for UOB One account  salary $1600 criteria.Is it possible to transfer from another bank account and then re-transfer the amount back to my other bank account. Will that hit the salary criteria? Or need to keep the amount in UOB account until the interest payout. Thanks,btohqsg
From the reddit post  apparently this has been the case since 2021 😂,btohqsg
Yup you’re absolutely right. This statement is a large amount  but yeah learned my lesson,btohqsg
I read dbs has current promo on agoda@7mpd.. please check out their t&c,btohqsg
Thanks Richard  so I can transfer back the amount immediately to my other bank account?,btohqsg
maybe not within the day. make sure that in the uob app.. salary has been 'checked'..,btohqsg
i nirmally 'transfer' around end of month.. then transfer out following 1st few days of the succeeding month,btohqsg
Would buying ntuc  e-voucher counted towards uob one account credit card spending requirement,btohqsg
at least for SGD  i can confirm it has NEVER been the case for August 2023 and earlier.. i do regular withdrawals..only today January 2024  I first noticed this SGD40 possible fee comment .,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword “Uob salary transfer” to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Did you check the bank account you monitoring is indeed tied to the NRIC paynow? Paynow via NRIC and paynow via HP can be 2 different accounts/banks.,btohqsg
I checked and is tied to a single bank account,btohqsg
Hi guys   I looked OCBC 360 and Singsavers card spend exclusion and they have something called extension payment plan. Is this refering to function like Atome or Cardup?,btohqsg
Although sounds weird  but try checking all your banks.to confirm which bank your paynow nric linked up to. 😄,btohqsg
I see thank you guys 😁,btohqsg

Hi can I check if all of these 3 qualify as online transaction? Planning to use my DBS WWC for them:1. If I go to a restaurant and scan QR code and pay on the website browser e.g Apple Pay2. If I go to a ecommerce website and pay via Apple Pay during the check out section3. If I give my card details to my gym (Anytime fitness) and it’s a recurring auto deduction on my card,btohqsg
Hi anyone know what mcc is the line resturant at shangri la hotel?,btohqsg
Is it ot guaranteed like moomoo ?,btohqsg
Is it under travel or dinning?,btohqsg
