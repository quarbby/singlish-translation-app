U make the exam less abt how much uk ur content but more like,btohqsg
wait so the guy that dmed you isn’t even part of the group that you were commenting on,btohqsg
but he kept picking fights with people in the gc,btohqsg
so i told him to stfu,btohqsg
then he dmed me and asked me whats my problem,btohqsg
why i keep fighting with him,btohqsg
everyone sane was fighting with him,btohqsg
then i just told him bro im not the one who is dming others,btohqsg
in fact some of the insane people here also fought with him,btohqsg
i rmbr the first argument he had with people was abt why,btohqsg
Poly is superior to JC in every way,btohqsg
then people were trying to convince him that,btohqsg
it depends on individual to individual,btohqsg
If i go medicine poly has a higher chance,btohqsg
i think he’s just trying to comfort himself for making right choices,btohqsg
then when he realised his arguments were failing,btohqsg
he just ad hominem the people talking to him,btohqsg
he said smth abt how yt has no right to talk to him abt this cuz hes retaking a levels,btohqsg
but ngl thats like every other person nowadays,btohqsg
cuz josh also said the same thing,btohqsg
he said that i have no right to talk to him cuz i have no friends of my age,btohqsg
which like just confused me so i just said okay love that for you,btohqsg
hes still in this chat grp i think,btohqsg
Long time ago he sent me this,btohqsg
he gonna go in thr an echo chamber himself,btohqsg
ngl he reminds me of my friend who got rejected from nus merit scholarship so spent like 3 months convincing himself that the nanyang school scholarship which he got is btr and that NTU is better than NUS in every way possible,btohqsg
Ngl sounds like Aaron lim Jun Jie,btohqsg
The dude who got famous on YT for fighting during a lecture a few years ago,btohqsg
lol for me maybe bc he dk enough about me to attack or smth,btohqsg
but he multiple times just said,btohqsg
“oh i didn’t actually mean it this way. phrase wrongly”,btohqsg
ok yea irrelevant got it thanks,btohqsg
wait till he find the cold hsrd truth that there can be people in poly 10x smarter than a jc student,btohqsg
im saying this cuz i was from jc so,btohqsg
one of my friends knows way more stories of him than i do,btohqsg
Idk when was it it's damn long ago but,btohqsg
