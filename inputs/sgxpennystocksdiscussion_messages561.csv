"14 OCTOBER : Business TimesBASED on feedback received by the Securities Investors Association (Singapore) or Sias  there is confusion and misunderstanding within some segments of the retail investing public over Temasek Holdings' mandatory conditional general offer to acquire all the issued and paid-up ordinary shares in Sembcorp Marine (Sembmarine).Some retail investors think that whenever a takeover offer is tabled  it must be at a premium to the share price at the time in order to make sense. Since Sembmarine's shares traded just above S$0.08 on Sep 22 when the offer was announced  they are wondering why Temasek has been allowed to offer only S$0.08.Others have asked if the word ""mandatory'' means that they are compelled by law to accept the offer.Here is some background:On Jun 24  Sembmarine announced a 3-for-2 rights issue at S$0.08 per share to raise S$1.5 billion.Temasek  through its wholly owned subsidiary Startree  owned 42.6 per cent of Sembmarine when the rights issue was announced. Startree said it would take up its pro rata rights entitlement as well as some of the excess rights.The exercise ended with Startree being allocated 9.3 billion rights shares  which then raised its stake by 4 per cent to 46.6 per cent.Rule 14.1 of the Singapore Take-over Code and Mergers states that if an entity controls 30 to 50 per cent of a company  then the controlling entity must make a mandatory general offer if it raises its interest in the company by more than 1 per cent. The offer price cannot be less than the highest price paid during the six months preceding the offer.The word ""mandatory'' refers to Startree's obligation to comply with the code and not a legal obligation on the part of shareholders to accept the offer.Temasek's offer is also conditional on Temasek's stake crossing 50 per cent when the offer closes.If the valid acceptances received are such that Temasek's stake is less than or equal to 50 per cent  the offer will lapse. All shares tendered in acceptance of the offer will be returned to shareholders. The offer closes at 5.30pm on Nov 3.Shareholders have three options:First  they can hang on to their shares and do nothing.Temasek has said it intends for Sembmarine to remain listed  but it has reserved the right to change this stance depending on the level of acceptances it receives and other factors.This should be the option for shareholders who expect a recovery in the company's fortunes.On the day the rights issue was announced in June  Sembmarine and Keppel Corp also announced the signing of a non-binding memorandum of understanding to explore a merger between Sembmarine and Keppel Offshore & Marine (Keppel O&M).But there is no guarantee this deal will take place.Second  they can sell either all or part of their shares to Temasek for S$0.08 each.Third  they can sell their shares in the open market.What shareholders do would depend on their outlook for Sembmarine.",btohqsg

$29 per trade? OCBC charges me $40,btohqsg
ocbc so high  yes per trade. buy in $29  sell also $29,btohqsg
Yes Kim eng and vicker min comm is $30,btohqsg
$40 maybe u trade big amount  almost 20k,btohqsg
that why i switch to tiger,btohqsg
No wor... Minimum 40... And the service is so yucky and gave me wrong information! I fired that bitch.,btohqsg
They earn so much comm from me  that's why last year send me calendar and cny ang pow $50,btohqsg
min $40 is broker assisted. You do online on your own min $25,btohqsg
I move my business from OCBC to iFast  Just $8.8 per trade... Never looked back,btohqsg
we play contra kind.... need credit. We pay a premium for commission to trade on credit,btohqsg
I trade Sembcorp recently UOB took $150+,btohqsg
those lower brokerage kind need cash upfront,btohqsg
I thought that's why their share hitting 10 soon?,btohqsg
10lots only it’s UOB too expensive,btohqsg
When I was young I used to practice muaythai and we legit train by kicking banana trees..So all this while I haven't been kicking herbs instead??!! 🤣,btohqsg
Poems Philip securities last time used to be minimum $25 per order.. Now dunno how muchBroker assisted is around $40Anybody knows what's the latest rates?,btohqsg
iFast is the only one with 8.8 flat that allows you to sell from CDP,btohqsg
still same if using CDP. If using their cash upfront custodian  it's cheaper,btohqsg
Imagine you when you sell your Sembcorp  only charge you 8.8 instead of 150,btohqsg
Bo lang use ib ah  comm so low,btohqsg
Used cash plus acct .. cheaper,btohqsg
I will open FSM account Got holding custodian fee or not,btohqsg
How to check if my is Cash Plus Acct.. Can contra also right?,btohqsg
This I not sure can contra or not..you have to call up peom to a open another act Cash plus ++$25 is cash management acct,btohqsg
If your account got credit without the need to deposit money,btohqsg
I think I open FSMONE first,btohqsg

I did not play contra..Only cash management acct can contra..Cash plus cheaper cannot contra..You open 2 acct in 1 times..,btohqsg
Means cash+ is cheap but slow system response?,btohqsg
Oh dear  slow may be an issue,btohqsg

🚀Pika World Update- Oct 26 2021🚀🍎Apple: Causing Pain for the Ads Community🍏The push to protect consumer privacy has made advertising towards targeted audiences more challenging than ever. It now affects many spectrum of businesses that rely on ads on many social media platforms to garner sales.🏑Scrambling for Alternatives🛹Indeed  advertisers have traditionally depended on mobile ads to reach out to their consumers. This week  we will have a first-hand look at how Twitter  Alphabet and Facebook will be impacted as they report their September earnings result.🪜A New Paradigm for Advertising📻Apple's move has caused profound complications for businesses. For example  targeted ads can still reach Android firms  but businesses are also keen to reach out to Apple's customers. Moreover  companies are facing a difficult time ascertaining if an Apple user has seen their ads.Some research showed that a small fraction of US consumers had opted in for tracking when offered a choice. The result is not a surprise given that there is little incentive for consumers to opt-in other than having received more targeted ads. It is reported that more than 80% of iOS devices had changed to a version that embedded more stringent ad standards.🪤Ripple Effect Across Companies🧰Snap  the social network  shocked Wall Street when it announced its result last Thursday that indicated a poorer outlook for the fourth quarter that is well short of expectation. While the company had blamed supply chain woes that deter companies from placing more ads  it had also conveyed the massive impact of Apple's measures on their business.This week earnings will shed more light on the resultant effects of Apple's action  and Pika World will be reviewing them closely.📱Facebook: To feel the Heat🕹The stock was firmer after a mixed set of results. Net income hit $9.19 billion or $3.22 per share ahead of Wall Street's estimate of $3.19 a share. However  revenue was slightly lower at $29.01 billion than the consensus of $29.49 billion.Guidance is also softer than expected  which was around $31.05 billion to $34 billion  short of analysts estimate at $34.7 billion. This is attributed to a continuous uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and the headwinds from Apple's iOS changes.Pika World believes that Facebook has some form of ability to weather the Apple iOS shock. Still  the company is facing more scrutiny of its business morals and ethics in the coming months.📮What's on the Menu Today?At 10 pm  we will receive the CB Consumer Confidence for October  which we expect to stay elevated at 108.3.New home sales data will be released  and it is expected to rise from 740K to 760K.It is Oct 26  Tuesday  7.05 am in Singapore and 7.05 pm in New York. It is an energy-packed week for earnings  and Pika World hopes all friends have a good week ahead!,btohqsg
dont know want to throw or not,btohqsg

This period  the pennies Market been quite crazy. I guess everyone is on the look out for that next Sunrise / Sinjia .I reckon Progen got chance to join this league as they have similar type characteristics and are generally quite light. But perhaps wait til this Friday T+4 whether they can maintain above 47/48 first or not.But who knows  it might come earlier than expected.  Price looks quite maintained for now.DYODD,btohqsg
