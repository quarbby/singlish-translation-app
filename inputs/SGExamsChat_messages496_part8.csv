100 thousand is barely material loss for big players,btohqsg
SG clams down pretty fcking hard on economic torts,btohqsg
i think mine is 3/6 months can choose,btohqsg
If theres anyth sg is good at its with laws that have to do with money,btohqsg
yea literally everything else is like a numbers game,btohqsg
I want to feel sad or angry,btohqsg
whether you get the lucky sentence or you dont,btohqsg
girl just first week into nyp,btohqsg
still got alot of time to learn about nyp,btohqsg
im pretty sure you gonna be tasked to write some essay,btohqsg
that is related to what you learnt for the module,btohqsg
they alr going thru assesment briefing.. hence cfm no such thing,btohqsg
unless its by semester then maybe got (idk whhy i js anyhow say),btohqsg
my online mods also got irl,btohqsg
i wonder how the other poly's actually go through online mods,btohqsg
mine is straightup...like a normal school day just i go ms team for lecturer only,btohqsg
wah kuro i damn happpy im nt in np,btohqsg
ppl keep having misconceptions that rp's rj must be like 300 words long everyday thing etc...But in reality its probably like 8/13 lessons  still alot dont get me wrong,btohqsg
But they will specify a number if they want a longer rj  if not usually people just write as much as they can,btohqsg
nah...the worse is attending class then getting mc,btohqsg
to cover the hrs you did not attend for the day,btohqsg
i mean...if people had the choice between rp or ite  rp would be a better option,btohqsg
but if you comparing across all 5 poly's...then yea rp should be your last choice,btohqsg
going uni is even harder in rp...because your gpa falls on consistency,btohqsg
it does not fall on major exams...i can confidently say 3/4 of your final gpa for graduation is made up of daily results,btohqsg
in rp  remoding is not seen as something uncommon,btohqsg
your 2nd point is also another reason why choose rp over ite,btohqsg
cause you are just going to a better ite academically wise,btohqsg
this is the tertiary mindset alr,btohqsg
oh yea  btw another intresting thing only rp students would know is that the dismissal time can range anywhere from 11am-3:30pm,btohqsg
The dismissal time depends on the lecturers,btohqsg
but the start time is the same throughout,btohqsg
that is music to rp students ears i guess,btohqsg
Imagine attending class at 9:15 then getting released at 11am,btohqsg
some of the rp y1's alr reporting that their classes start at 10 lmao,btohqsg
@Voidchordsthis is the first time i got MC for this course,btohqsg
