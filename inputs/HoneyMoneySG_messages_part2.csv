https://youtu.be/PGPaJVAewhcAre you trying to start your investment journey  but have not made the first step because you donâ€™t know which Stock broker to choose?Then you have to watch this video because I will share my own personal experience with the brokers I have used beforeAnd review the good and bad about each broker  so that you donâ€™t have to!,btohqsg
seems that there's something called platform fee for Moomoo trading in US stocks,btohqsg
If I understand it correctly  $0.0049/share for commission fee and $0.005/share for platform fee  that's almost the same as Tiger's $0.01 commission fee?,btohqsg
ðŸ˜¢ actually  I just referred to Tiger's website  and realized that Tiger's $0.01 is also composed of $0.05 and $0.05... no problem now,btohqsg
ðŸ˜† so they are really offering similar things  I would just choose one of them randomly,btohqsg
Yes  they both are rather identical on US Trade commissions,btohqsg
Just good for sign up bonuses,btohqsg
true  and I just signed up Tiger with your referral linkðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Thank you  and for the broken link reminder too!,btohqsg
no problem! I really like your videos  really helpful for me as a new-comer to SingaporeðŸ˜†,btohqsg
Ultimately  in the long term  just go with IBKR. These platforms like MooMoo  Tiger  not sure how long they can sustain with their aggressive promos.,btohqsg
yeah... but the share of AAPL is really inviting,btohqsg
the same country Moomoo and Tiger are from :),btohqsg
Cool ðŸ˜Ž enjoy your time here!While i churn out more content ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
ðŸ¤” Just out of curiosity  another Youtuber I follow  Kelvin  also made a video on brokers today. Is it a coincidence or any reason behind?,btohqsg
ðŸ¤£ ok  just found it interesting,btohqsg
Yeah its good also  so my videos get suggested on his feed also,btohqsg
Lucas Ouellethas been banned! Reason:CAS ban.,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/TUyWL1G0HYkIn this video  I will review the 1Q FY21/22 financial results of one of my REIT holdings  ticker M44U  Mapletree Logistics Trust (MLT) and give you my opinions of it.I will walkthrough the the points from their official presentation slides such as key highlights  financials and business outlook  and translate them into layman terms to make it easy for you to understand  so that you donâ€™t have to!,btohqsg
PSA: Moomoo new signup promo has changed from 1 AAPL share to 2 PFE shares,btohqsg
Hi Chris  do you use it during pre-peak timing? Are you able to get the pre-peak discount on your Revolut card?,btohqsg
Yes  I got $0.50 off for tapping in before 7.45am in MRT,btohqsg
They deduct it immediately or the discount is rebated at the end of the month?,btohqsg
Immediately  just like how normal ez link works,btohqsg
Shit man. I think my fares are not discounted and I am still unable to link my Revolut card to the TL SimplyGo app,btohqsg
Anyway  those who signed up Revolut using my link but haven't fulfilled the conditions for $15 (add money  make 3 payments)  please do so within 24h or the offer will expire!,btohqsg
It's for MRT only  bus not included and should be automatic,btohqsg
Yes. I took it for MRT but wasnâ€™t discounted. I confirmed a few times already,btohqsg
Hard to track if not on Simplygo app. Anyway if i were you then i would just use normal card to pay just so i get $0.50 for non peak morning  first. Then evening trip back use revolut,btohqsg
Hi Chris  do you think credit score is important in sg? I know it's important overseas in countries like US but I haven't heard much about its use in the sg context.,btohqsg
Not an expert on this but I generally feel it is not a big emphasis on SG  like even if you are HH  it will recover some day to at least a CC when you paid up. Unless you are perpetually a bad debt individual,btohqsg
Fun fact i was HH at one point  the lowest credit score in Singapore,btohqsg
I probably had too many cards at that point and CBS doesn't like it,btohqsg
So credit scores aren't looked at even if u wanna take a housing loan?,btohqsg
It is important for bank loan  not so much for HDB loan,btohqsg
Yeah  hdb loan only cares if you have regular income and sufficient cpf oa balance to pay the mortgage,btohqsg
true  I also wonder whether credit cards are commonly used in SG,btohqsg
More common now than 5 years ago. But QR payments is growing even faster!Some places (small provision shops) still don't credit card accept though,btohqsg
I noticed something weird: many shops do have POS machines  but they claim to accept only cash and NETS payment  not visa and master cards,btohqsg
Is there any reason for that? just wodnering,btohqsg
hmmm  those shops nearby my home don't accept QR payments though,btohqsg
Visa/mc charges merchant fee about 3%. So they want to save cost,btohqsg
ðŸ˜¢ that makes sense... and that's also the reason why AMEX is so unpopular,btohqsg
Yep the merchant fee for Amex is also higher then Visa/MC,btohqsg
Generally large merchants are okay with the fees because credit cards can also attract card users (also travellers) to spend there.But now QR payment is already close to zero fees (for now)  so i believe merchants should at least have Paynow QR to really just move to digitization,btohqsg
Hey guys  do you guys rather buy dividend stocks on CDP linked brokerages or custodian brokers? Thanks,btohqsg
For me  I buy on whatever platform that has the cheapest fees :),btohqsg
So if custodian brokers is the cheapest  will buy from there?,btohqsg
but for beginners like me  I think Tiger and Moomoo are easier to useðŸ˜†,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone knows whether topping up Grab wallet is counted for the minimum spending requirement of credit cards?ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
