is FYP as a whole very taxing,btohqsg
ever since i realised i might need to pull up my gpa i've been considering doing FYP now LOL,btohqsg
tbh it depends on your prof,btohqsg
if you still feel like doing it in after y3  lmk and i'll give suggestions,btohqsg
my fyp prof was p good,btohqsg
im giving myself until past y3s1 to decide,btohqsg
i met him a total of 3 times through the year LOL,btohqsg
but yeah i'll let you know,btohqsg
Did u do URECA I wanna do FYP-URECA but idk if it's worth,btohqsg
Maybe just take the L and then get 4AUs in BDEs,btohqsg
Convenient in that I get to start in Y2,btohqsg
But kinda stressful cuz it adds on course load,btohqsg
If FYP-URECA is just copy paste and add a bit more on your URECA existing project then might be worth,btohqsg
personal thought is that URECA is for people that wanna do research in the future or test the waters to see if it's for them,btohqsg
Oh are u in the alumni association along w irwen,btohqsg
Wait u can not do fyp?,btohqsg
If u and irwen were there on I day,btohqsg
I would ditch irwen to meet u,btohqsg
they only want me for my slavery in SPMS club,btohqsg
Yep only if u are below 3.9 then u can choose not to do FYP,btohqsg
idk i dont have any girls so dates arent my thing,btohqsg
Isit like smth u can just built on. Like use your existing essay and extend it,btohqsg
Gotta overload so I get to join yall for graduation,btohqsg
for course load reasons i'd rather just skip URECA and do FYP on its own,btohqsg
Merit and pass only cuz 3.9,btohqsg
nah u r married to the russian dude,btohqsg
3.5-3.99 is honours merit3-3.49 is honours,btohqsg
then musician must aim for first class honours,btohqsg
U get the honors just Merit and Pass basically,btohqsg
if i could graduate with merit i would die happy,btohqsg
Maybe I should do that purposely tank and just don't do FYP,btohqsg
But need to do 2 more 4k mods which imo is soo worth,btohqsg
I like me some mashed potatoes,btohqsg
up to you bc FYP for you works differently from me so can't advise as well as i'd like,btohqsg
the cable holding for dear life fr  need to buy replacement,btohqsg
