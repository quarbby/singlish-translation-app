Next week I haveA math   physics Chem  geo  ss   history,btohqsg
GIRLS IN GRP Q I FIND TOTAL GIRLS,btohqsg
A lot of people here also have careless mistake. Your not the only one. Dont worry.,btohqsg
u r the person that needs to study geog rite,btohqsg
I realise the bearing one sia,btohqsg
If u truly believed u worked hard and stayed hungry for that Grade u want. U will surely not fail,btohqsg
I minus about 5m for paper 2,btohqsg
i remember not studying food resources at all for my Os last yt,btohqsg
I remember it since term 2,btohqsg
I bet u $900000 u will pass ur emath@meltedmangofrap,btohqsg
Oh we hv 1 gateway this year,btohqsg
I bet $5 u will get A1,btohqsg
Just my dream of b3 gone,btohqsg
Cause last year I already did most of the work,btohqsg
Grab that b3 by the neck and beat the sht out of it,btohqsg
And quite coincidentally the poly course i want,btohqsg
Entire geo condensed into 25pages ish,btohqsg
i liked learning  hated studying for it,btohqsg
The whole fucking cohort so zai,btohqsg
I thgt i was special bc i can do the hex triangle,btohqsg
My notes look something like this,btohqsg
But my human geo have more colors,btohqsg
the writing i can never have,btohqsg
Btw if udl bio u shldnt go for it,btohqsg
me during gp just get finger cramps and writes so illegibly,btohqsg
Its damn bio dense frm what i heard LOL,btohqsg
U dont hv to take bio to get into biotech,btohqsg
I rmb that and latitude altitude proximity frm sea,btohqsg
Then got the 3 types of climate,btohqsg
My tourism notes be Super colourful thoufh ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I didnt study weather for prelims,btohqsg
What if Iâ€™m not male HAHA,btohqsg
Yes section b ended up as both qns fully abt tourism,btohqsg
Study 3 out of 4 topics,btohqsg
Variable weather will only be a subtopic this year,btohqsg
That's why don't take geog it is so bad take history instead!,btohqsg
Food just whack Zimbabwe and Venezuela,btohqsg
2 days is all i need to memorise all the info,btohqsg
literally used it for environment qn,btohqsg
I never am going to rmb it yes,btohqsg
Oh we had this convo before,btohqsg
HAHA I donâ€™t study from the textbook,btohqsg
I used malthusian argument for environment,btohqsg
For my actual a lvl essay,btohqsg
Is it bad that i dont know,btohqsg
Other than sun moon lake earthquake at 2am,btohqsg
Lol yâ€™all want do a pop quiz for geo,btohqsg
As example for the time of occurremce affecting earthquake,btohqsg
But i felt my essay was simple  sweet and succinct,btohqsg
I test the hardest content for fun,btohqsg
Basically population growth is exponential which will outstrip food supply,btohqsg
In prelims i wrote the jbq abt recessions and the other factors,btohqsg
"""Assess the view that attempts to control climate change can never truly be effective""",btohqsg
Tho i put in effort for prelims,btohqsg
Thats why i wrote it near to the end,btohqsg
Yes studying for geog doesnt help me,btohqsg
Itâ€™s ok I failed my gi,btohqsg
If tourism fails me i'm gg for my second choice course,btohqsg
"MY PROMO QN WAS "" ENVIRONMENT CONSERVATION EFFORTS IS OF LITTLE IMPACT""",btohqsg
The rest of the section pull up,btohqsg
I got 9/25 for GI ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
To stand out just dont use mainstream example,btohqsg
To score higher marks for essay examples,btohqsg
Is just 1 single detailed example,btohqsg
Tbh u can just use Kyoto protocol,btohqsg
That gives a clear concise idea of what is happening from a micro to a macro level,btohqsg
Also it makes it easier to argue,btohqsg
For me another example i used in my environmental essay was the Itaupi dam,btohqsg
It doesnâ€™t matter if it is cause youâ€™ll still get the marks if u use it,btohqsg
I think my cher dk how mark,btohqsg
I mean if u getting like full marks ok sure,btohqsg
Need to use a range of examples  from old to recent,btohqsg
Just like how some ppl like to flex content abt babylonian in their opening paragraphs,btohqsg
But I donâ€™t think necessary memorise extra things,btohqsg
Tbh I donâ€™t write opening paragraph in geo essay,btohqsg
no no he talking abt gp,btohqsg
For o levels to prepare for essay I actually read general paper ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
well for gp  content is most important ah soooo,btohqsg
Donâ€™t understand 1/2 of what itâ€™s saying though sometimes,btohqsg

Literary 50% of Singapore gets distinctions for a math,btohqsg
Who else gonna sleep tomorrow during LC?,btohqsg
No lc can make and break an a1 btw,btohqsg
Singapore is just a small population in Asia.,btohqsg
Bro I spent 8hrs on discord,btohqsg
Sure  majority of Asians are good at maths but Jay is saying there are outliers.,btohqsg
I slept through half of my prelims LC,btohqsg
is impossible for every1 to be 'good' at maths if we define what is 'good',btohqsg
sadly Cambridge doesn't use it for O/A Levels,btohqsg
maybe someone write in to them to use bell curve,btohqsg
then we will see what happens,btohqsg
My scholar in my class can finish o level a math paper in 1/8 the tome,btohqsg
that same scholar may potentially get destroyed in uni,btohqsg

But itâ€™s like MCQ and itâ€™s circle not square options  lmao I feel like ppl that tikam Qn they donâ€™t know are likely to score higher than somebody losing 50marks for non-attempt lmao. Unless you tell me there is mark deduction for wrong answer.,btohqsg
is 1/3 mcq  1/3 multiple select answer mcq  and 1/3 calculation fill in the blank,btohqsg
the above qn was just a single option mcq,btohqsg
