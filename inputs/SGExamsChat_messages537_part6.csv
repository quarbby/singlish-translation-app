cos i need nanosecond stability in my function call from my code for my experiment,btohqsg
so went to Google  and read up,btohqsg
I hated assembly class in Uni but now I realize it‚Äôs fascinating  but not enough for me to wanna learn it hahaha,btohqsg
last time it was all finance blogs,btohqsg
loading from RAM vs loading from L3 cache is the most jitter i get in my work,btohqsg
Nowadays feels like there‚Äôs a lot of good but a lot more trash mixed in to the online finance space,btohqsg
and somehow this is the shit i dive into despite my physics phd,btohqsg
Just curious  are the memory addresses for cache space and ram space different function calls in assembly,btohqsg
and find a style that suits you,btohqsg
bruh fk me i only know one call heap one call stack LOL,btohqsg
iirc cache are the ax to ex registers  now with up to their 512 bit variants  but i sus that memory is virtual memory addresses now  controlled by the kernel through paging,btohqsg
eg last few months did u invest in any,btohqsg
I‚Äôm the index funds only belief with slight beta tilt and slight US bias to value,btohqsg
Just use endowus  I open IBKR but I lazy to finish those due diligence stuff to make my first deposit there,btohqsg
Maybe once I hit 6 figure on endowus I go get serious about the brokerage,btohqsg
So the address space there‚Äôs no unique name convention to specifically add something to l3 cache ah,btohqsg
It‚Äôs all managed by the hardware alr?,btohqsg
Nowadays modern brokerage have lower fees tho,btohqsg
i think intel self chooses the L level caching ya  im still really new to this and i have to hop around on optimising so many different areas i haven't sat down to stare at this nanosecond thing in a while already,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the risk vs the one you use in your view,btohqsg
lower fees is because the brokerage is the custodian. In the rare situation that it fails  your $$ is as good as zero,btohqsg
thoughts on robo-advisors for a fresh-grad?,btohqsg
But this is true for any brokerage,btohqsg
Not for traditional brokerages in SG,btohqsg
If you don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to learn they‚Äôre a safe but lower return choice in my opinion,btohqsg
SG stocks are held in CDP. So if the brokerages closed down  the shares in the CDP is still yours,btohqsg
fair  ill definetly have to swap out of it once i have the mental space,btohqsg
you can use any of the brokerages to buy or sell it,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt mean that in like a ‚Äúoh you can‚Äôt learn way‚Äù but that if you can make money thinking about your phd it‚Äôs more optimal to outsource your investing to robos,btohqsg
But that being said you can‚Äôt outsource all your thinking to any company even if they‚Äôre good companies,btohqsg
not like phd pay that good also üòù,btohqsg
Fair  but consider this ah:Some brokerages have longer history and deeper financial pockets and volume/customer base than the whole of SG finance space,btohqsg
now if invest  target is to beat 3%,btohqsg
So if they go down  relative to SGX go kaboom  everyone will be affected very significantly,btohqsg
Singapore also won‚Äôt survive such calamity,btohqsg
some banks also older and more established than SG and still fail,btohqsg
There is only 1 us securities exchange I know which did go bankrupt and it was a commodities exchange,btohqsg
And the customers are inconvenienced only,btohqsg
Cause the brokerages are all backed by us govt insurance,btohqsg
that's if you move your $$ to US.Then you become subject to potential policy changes,btohqsg
I guess? But then Singapore also subject to policy risk,btohqsg
In our investing history  Mahathir was the best example,btohqsg
And Singapore derives most of its FDI from the US,btohqsg
So we are married to them like it or not haha,btohqsg
Consider if you have 500k liquid investment  will you do that,btohqsg
ok I know Adam Khoo does that,btohqsg
Yes  my projection is to have all my money in a global portfolio which is managed by us brokerages,btohqsg
Until 40/50 then rebalance into less volatile assets,btohqsg
It's easy to consider rebalancing if there's profit,btohqsg
what if it's in the red  due to some recession. Are you still going to rebalance or hold on in hopes of making back then rebalance,btohqsg
