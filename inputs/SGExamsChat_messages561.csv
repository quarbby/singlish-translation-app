@chemcerI see what u mean by tm geog being questionable,btohqsg
Someone from tm asked me for geog help and I wanna bang my head against a wall because it seems like they didn't Learn the basic fundamentals of how to write a geog essay,btohqsg
I will try and damage control (but I also don't feel like it)?,btohqsg
Nth much I can do also a levels is in 1 month,btohqsg
Issokay nth can beat my experience with ri geog chers RJ geog chers feeding wrong info half the time,btohqsg
Dorcas my friends all say gd,btohqsg
my teacher makes 'notes' that are copied and pasted from wikipedia,btohqsg
literally the notes she gives us are in different fonts and sizes because its copy and pasted,btohqsg
The other geog cher for my batch leh,btohqsg
in a single set of notes,btohqsg
Why does tm have so many geog chers,btohqsg
Is ur geog cher the Lena person,btohqsg
Why is thr an article on her abt her being rude on public transport,btohqsg
No I just went to Google her name,btohqsg
well know among sg geog chers,btohqsg
shes another geographer that studied under TC Chang,btohqsg
TC Chang students are like this,btohqsg
All the cultural urban geographers have that vibe,btohqsg
thats also cuz TC Chang is like this,btohqsg
I worried abt her being sick,btohqsg
Do uk what lena koh specialised in,btohqsg
Nah this is what teaching geog does to someone,btohqsg
Also cuz all the JC/O Level geog chers know each other,btohqsg
Like TJ  NJ  EJ CHS geog chers all from the same cohort of NUS Geographers,btohqsg
Do uk ng lee hwa by any chance,btohqsg
Be Hella goofy if u do sia,btohqsg
Is that why tj geog is dying,btohqsg
TJ Geog severely underperformed in 2022 a levels,btohqsg
I think they were the only JC where the distinction rate dropped,btohqsg
50% distinction for geog then TJ should be getting 60-70%,btohqsg
that‚Äôs crazy im so far from that alr,btohqsg
I'm gonna rot in PW now,btohqsg
Ngl the only geog chers that are kinda like,btohqsg
Ik NY had the highest in SG,btohqsg
It's the only 1 I rmb,btohqsg
last yr h1 geog paper was kinda hard,btohqsg
theres only so many ways u can compare Aw and Am,btohqsg
Wait what did the acjc cher do sia,btohqsg
no la he just calls the students stupid all the time,btohqsg
economic geographers study under henry yeung,btohqsg
henry yeung is the nus professor who got into a case,btohqsg
chem chers are normally like this,btohqsg
My chem cher in EJ was also like this,btohqsg
Idk if she taking my class next yr sia,btohqsg
3 of ej chem chers have phds for some reason,btohqsg
Paper 1 n 2 next wk,btohqsg
next yr no one will ask u abt ur o level results,btohqsg
one year later those 1 month of exams wont matter anymore,btohqsg
q chill now I kinda not motivated,btohqsg
Idw next yr start everyone ask n I score bad bro,btohqsg
anyone asks each other for their o level results,btohqsg
Anyways YT that tm guy geog cher is christopher,btohqsg
uni next year ppl gna ask how I scored in a lvl,btohqsg
I think diff schs just teach very differently,btohqsg
Like ej places alot of emphasis on evaluation which ac yi mi ri doesnt,btohqsg
I mean I just rmb cher nagging abt 2 sided arguement and shit,btohqsg
(Which some schs also don't teach),btohqsg
Ej is like if ur topic sentence has no evaluation u will fail ur essay or smth,btohqsg
I have never done evaluation in GP essays,btohqsg
I mean u saw my essay la üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
U must evaluate in ur topic sentence,btohqsg
If not ur essay will not pass,btohqsg
Oh this and this only works in dc,btohqsg
Why did u take h1 geog,btohqsg
PHYSICS IN JC IS SO PREDICTABLE,btohqsg
Every year test the same thing one damn boring,btohqsg
The trick to scoring in a levels is to stop thinking,btohqsg
now l1r5 for jc quite low,btohqsg
I did not take o levels,btohqsg
tmjc in 2021 cut out pnts was 11 pnts,btohqsg
Actually I never rly pay attention to cut off points,btohqsg
My nett score is 12 eh,btohqsg
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY TM STUDENTS HERE,btohqsg
I alw hear it's 13 wtff,btohqsg
she kena rejected frm sajc with 11 pnts,btohqsg
There's no one from ej except those 3 people from the a level grp,btohqsg
my sis is j2 this year,btohqsg
I need hope that tm geog is gd,btohqsg
Ik someone in j2 batch now,btohqsg
Bro my friends in h1 hist,btohqsg
I applied to do trip sci trip humans in IP in my sec sch,btohqsg
its like pure hist in sec sch,btohqsg
U literally cannot study the cold War like,btohqsg
i take pure hist so it is gg to be easy easy,btohqsg
H2 history was q fun ngl,btohqsg
I liked studying south east Asia,btohqsg
But I did econs and history for fun,btohqsg
ik q a few ppl taking that combi for some reason üíÄ,btohqsg
Like I just sat in the lectures and did my own shit and cuz all my friends study econs and history i effectively know enough to like,btohqsg
maths  phys + chem  pure hist  elect geog + ss  english  maths,btohqsg
ok at least not suicide combi,btohqsg
i got that in sec sch,btohqsg
So my batch is legit weird fuck la,btohqsg
My batch has a total of,btohqsg
I think its just my class,btohqsg
My batch had a total of 2 CMEl students,btohqsg
Eh I thought tm didn't allow C tgt w fm,btohqsg
We also had more students taking h1 physics than h2 physics,btohqsg
Has never had more than 70% of the cohort get above a U for h2 physics,btohqsg
17 out of 100 and be in the top 40%,btohqsg
Ej paper just diff breed la,btohqsg
The best improved for physics for prelims in our batch jumped 30 marks,btohqsg
Feel like once I start doing ej n,btohqsg
And cuz my batch is so desensitized (they spent every lecture saying we are the worst batch),btohqsg
NY has a total of 3 geog chers,btohqsg
Ngl is there any jc that has no scandals,btohqsg
Or nth to slander them abt,btohqsg
I feel like every jc have,btohqsg
i haven't heard much about asr & ej ...?,btohqsg
That's cuz u will only know ej scandals if ur from ej,btohqsg
Our principal likes to keep things covered up,btohqsg
then every jcs have lor liddat,btohqsg
Nj PW dept probs most infamous PW dept,btohqsg
Then she alw meme abt it,btohqsg
Literally the only 1 in the entire sch,btohqsg
Ok no there's 3 other ppl who take,btohqsg
TSD = theatre studies n drama,btohqsg
Ik got 1 guy CMTSD smth,btohqsg
as in i know what tsd is but,btohqsg

She thought I h2 geog btw.,btohqsg
lol then dhs i got grandmother story alr,btohqsg
Hot pot w y'all would be interesting as fuck sia,btohqsg
nvm i swear kuro and i hotpot with the others like once every few weeks,btohqsg
This is not Gaza  this is not war. This is the remains of a condo in the Us. After a construction company decided to cut corners on a ground floor pool.The structural integrity of the condo was compromised because of the pool builders and it collapsed under its own weight taking 98 lives,btohqsg
Ain‚Äôt no way he got mixed up,btohqsg
the journey has been a long one,btohqsg
ngl the counting from such a large number has been cool,btohqsg
@chemcer's number even larger  can ask him continue the trend,btohqsg
after o levels is the time to be able to have more screentime,btohqsg
too bad u have olvls now,btohqsg
im gonna do anything to build up my profile,btohqsg
oh gonna end in 4 weeks time,btohqsg
wait ur olvls gonna end after i ord,btohqsg
The psle kids alr‚Ä¶preparing to become paikias in their sec school alr,btohqsg
im gonna enjoy the tea w my popcorn üçµüçµ,btohqsg
People who think they can change society,btohqsg
smuggling weed indicates that- you bypassed sg security to be able to get weed  so youre basically a threat to them- you broke the drug law- your money is dirty and you probably have set up an illegal business- you risk the security of people that help smuggle you the weed,btohqsg
i think singapore labels marijuana under rhe same lavel as the rest of the drugs,btohqsg
Because sales from drugs especially marijuana funds terrorism,btohqsg
thats why the tax is so high for large quantity of goods or luxury goods  the idea has always been detterent not destruction,btohqsg
the issue is weed unlike goods are not something that is required for a country to run,btohqsg
that is the same reason why firecrackers are banned...they dont contribute anything to the economy,btohqsg
casinos are how our country make money,btohqsg
that is not the reason...the same issue behind bubblegum  it was not banned because of littering/cleanliness issue,btohqsg
then do you believe bubblegum was banned because of cleanliness?,btohqsg
no im saying like bubblegum  firecrackers had another reason...just because they injure someone..or people died dont mean they get banned.There are alot of prohibited items allowed through ICA that could do more damage than a firecracker,btohqsg
you said there are prohibited items allowed through ICA,btohqsg
wrong source  give me a sec,btohqsg
first of all  if they intentionally allow it in it's not prohibited,btohqsg
There are people selling unauthorised sparkles through carousell,btohqsg
again  that doesn't mean they allow,btohqsg
if it was indeed a safety hazard...why would they still continue producing it in sg?,btohqsg
your ndp fireworks come from where,btohqsg
No im just saying..safety cant be the only reason. thats all,btohqsg
there was definitely another reason that weighed heavier,btohqsg
because bubblegum was not banned because of cleanliness,btohqsg
Im just saying what i believe..you dont believe its up to you...It does not concern or matter to me what you believe in.,btohqsg
you sound like an sg version of a flat earther rn,btohqsg
You tell me..if you truly believe it was because of clealiness  you think lky would change his mind that quickly?After his govt's new train system was getting disrupted,btohqsg
nah i dont believe in all these bs...what i believe in is that the govt will never be 100% on the ppl's side,btohqsg
i could give any less regard to politics  i just find it intresting...how the govt runs a country  how much a govt can manipulate its people to believe something as good or bad,btohqsg
Going OBS now  I hope I don't laosai,btohqsg
why were yall talking abt drugs,btohqsg
u gg to palau ubin or the punggol one ?,btohqsg
there will be boars and monkeys arnd‚Ä¶ later they come and steal ur food,btohqsg
at obs a giant black and white ant (like the size of my thumb which is p big) dropped on my lap from the leaves of the tree above,btohqsg
now i have ptsd of gigantic ants because u cant kill it by stepping on it u had to squish it with all your might,btohqsg
i still remember it 4 years ago,btohqsg
dude last year my sch went to obs. the boars and the monkeys stole our food away in palau ubin,btohqsg
and we had nthg much left to eat for obs üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
we only had biscuits and spam,btohqsg
the boys in my grp went arnd the tent showing their abs LOL LOL,btohqsg
it was damn funny cos it was so weird,btohqsg
oh they even showed theirs in front of my year head,btohqsg
and then she went absolutely disgusted,btohqsg
SHE WAS LIKE YALL TRYING TO RIZZ UP THE GIRLS lmao,btohqsg
must be eccentric to be in a cave era in 21st century,btohqsg
pls dont tell me u ate insects too,btohqsg
i heard there gg to be insect in every food in cmg years,btohqsg
you go to the police station,btohqsg
eh report to their sch or smth,btohqsg
My classmates got bullied at obs,btohqsg
my sec 3 camp supposed to be at dairy farm but they cancel,btohqsg
I had but purposely fell sick before going,btohqsg
this reminds me i was shocked to find out sg is the third most country that has the most bullying cases,btohqsg
when i was finding what to write for discursive or argumentative essay,btohqsg
Let me guess the 2nd and 1st place was Hhong Kong and China,btohqsg
i think south korea bullying cases is pretty bad,btohqsg
i mean there was that recent case of Pyo Ye-Rim,btohqsg
honestly if u kena bullied at sch complain to cher also no use. only option is for ur parents to come down and complain to principal. if complain to principal also no use go moe and complain,btohqsg
"bruh one time i complain then my cher was like ""jst ignore them""",btohqsg
it worked once for me in p3. but after tht doesn't work alr,btohqsg
i rmbr i bullied my bully back,btohqsg
even though my pri sch was one of the top choices ppl sent their children there,btohqsg
i became friends wif my bully,btohqsg
i rmbr nearly wacking my bully wif a book in sec 1. then we became frens in sec 3,btohqsg
PUNDEH THAT ONE 3 DECADES AGO SIMI SAY PINGED TODAY ONLY,btohqsg
simi where i got pro in studies,btohqsg
last time i touched a book was a year ago,btohqsg
jolibee spaghetti was 2.95 and now it is $6 w drinks,btohqsg
ex  inflation kicking in. time to make ur own,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like the spaghetti i ate from kindergarten,btohqsg
yea they use smth called banana ketchup,btohqsg
is 85% considered an A1 for emath,btohqsg
what‚Äôs the percentage to score an A1 for Emath for o levels,btohqsg
My time was 24 years ago. My teacher at that time already said >90%Doubt it changed much.,btohqsg
aiya can one la 85 q high alr,btohqsg
Must ask the bell curve god,btohqsg
I thought I did well for POA  I got B3,btohqsg
go temple go church go idk where,btohqsg
Actually now so many years later  I can explain a bit why need that high. It's not because of the bell curve  it is because many students have actually very poor presentation.You may think you are correct  but poor presentation leads to loss of marks  to the extent of dropping a grade or 2,btohqsg
so.... if you are doing well already  good. Last step is to focus heavily on logical presentation of ideas to finally achieve the answer.Mathematics presentation is actually giving an argument (similar to argumentative essay) in mathematical language.,btohqsg
4√ó5w and multiple the bottom too,btohqsg
lj i thought thats how many days u have to ORD üíÄ,btohqsg
i'll be wondering what you did in DB,btohqsg
to cause you to wait that long for ORD,btohqsg
sorry  i just dk what that means,btohqsg
i got rejected by taylor swift,btohqsg
wait how is his 40 more days than me,btohqsg
oh he definitely relates to that,btohqsg
After Brunei  I don't think anywhere in SG can traumatise you,btohqsg
sg students are good at maths so the bellcurve changed sm,btohqsg
let's just say that during my time  I scored >95% for prelims and I'm not the top.That's the competition everyone will be facing,btohqsg
thats why my teacher scolded us so badly if one of us had no 5 step presentation in sec 1,btohqsg
Cambridge markers report for science already talk about presentation with a more polished and refined language,btohqsg
prediction: how graph is misleading qn might be tested,btohqsg
am supposed to report at 2,btohqsg
how to travel from harbourfront to Punggol in 15 mins,btohqsg
Yeah take premium taxi if you have to geez,btohqsg
As fast as is safely possible,btohqsg
Prep all your stuff hold in hand  ready to discard bag  IC  calculator  stationery all ready  phone kept in bag,btohqsg
If only I could be late for X72,btohqsg
why do u even nap b4 exams,btohqsg
i'll be to stressed to even nap,btohqsg
cuz if i nap i'll dream bout the ppr,btohqsg
sleep after the paper not b4,btohqsg
i heard he sleeps for 2h during alvls math,btohqsg
this message needs to be pinned,btohqsg
u can remove my rights afterwards,btohqsg
wait ik how to trigger u more,btohqsg
sounds like the amt of time i take to do my h1 geog paper,btohqsg
the travel itself is like 30 mins,btohqsg
never factor in the wait time for the grab oso,btohqsg
the closer u get to ord,btohqsg
thats why u think ord is very precious,btohqsg

What the heck was that 4048 paper... SEAB has forsaken us,btohqsg
Gg  now I can only pray for B,btohqsg
I think I am screwed I am literally in tears ü´†,btohqsg
I am fucking crying cause I didn't have enough time and the other half my answers I don't even think they're correct.,btohqsg
Apparently SEAB thinks we're all retakers (I'm not) so they should set the hardest paper ever,btohqsg
At this point I can give up any dreams of going to poly,btohqsg
Even harder than last year lmao,btohqsg
Tf why this time got 27 questions,btohqsg
The right angle triangle how did you all prove ? I use isos triangle then take one angle as x and then use common point etc etc then add up which proves 90 degree,btohqsg
I didn't even do I was rushing so much ü´†,btohqsg
I think at this point unless paper 2 is super easy my math is like d7 alr..,btohqsg
U can say based on circle properties,btohqsg
Same I'd be lucky to clutch 40/80,btohqsg
I'd be lucky to even pass..,btohqsg
You can draw a circle around the triangle ?,btohqsg
That or they decided that 90% for A was too absurd and decided to stump everyone this time round,btohqsg
Can only pray to the bell curve god,btohqsg
Yeah ok that one also can,btohqsg
Anyways I think paper 2 for 4052 will be a killer,btohqsg
"They didn't even ask ""why is the visual misleading""  they added *similarity* to it",btohqsg
Making it impossible to secure the 1 mark for me lmao,btohqsg
I did the v1/v2=(l1/l2)^3 thing but ended up with something weird like 0.622 (they said the tin for 2020 is 3 times the size of the tin for 2010 or something),btohqsg
but paper 1 was q tough tho,btohqsg
how much harder can it be,btohqsg
You see SEAB and Cambridge hates 2007,btohqsg
Maybe to them this paper is rather doable,btohqsg
Cambridge is founded in the year of the snake lmao and we are pigs according to chinese zodiac,btohqsg
Sean and Cambridge just got hatred for us,btohqsg
Now even paper 1 math was hard,btohqsg
I can just pass away at this point,btohqsg
Elec History SBQ was gay too,btohqsg
Ite which one is the best,btohqsg
I took ITE general ed for this so I know,btohqsg
If you can go west go west,btohqsg
but realistically if you live in the east you have no choice  commute from east to ITE central is like 1 hour,btohqsg
I live an hour away from all. I wanted to go poly but gg ü´† ite it is,btohqsg
east is shit. dont come here,btohqsg
at least central has a sieng siong inside,btohqsg
east only has a dumb shop,btohqsg
thats y u see ppl go out of sch,btohqsg
central has am entire mall inside,btohqsg
