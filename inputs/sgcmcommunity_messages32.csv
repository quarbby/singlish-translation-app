Hello  any tips for second hand car purchase? like what to look out for etc...,btohqsg
Try looking for a car with full service records  but abit rare ah,btohqsg
how to verify if records are real ah,btohqsg
Certain things like checking for leaks is after u do ur test drives then u check under,btohqsg
Usually if u looking for cars like the conti ah  they got service book one then u can verify,btohqsg
If u looking at others ah  will have receipts of the service done,btohqsg
1) Pre-Purschase inspection (Facebook search for company providing that service)2)https://www.mycarly.com/cart/this OBD reader claim to be able to find true mileage of the car,btohqsg
Aluminium alloy can be stronger than most steel... Audi also use aluminium,btohqsg
Best to have service history. Must be accident free.,btohqsg
The service history is important. It tells that your meter is not rigged too. And that gives an idea of the work and reliability of the car,btohqsg
Next is accident free. A good dealer would provide this inspection and checks,btohqsg
Because they don't have it there  usually c180 on display,btohqsg
But got people who will buy as they want the badge,btohqsg
Should be part of your tool kit if your are 1st owner of the car  otherwise got to visit dealer,btohqsg
Then I drive on for another 50 or so.,btohqsg
Then I filled up to the top and take readings.,btohqsg
Aftermarket lug nut  I lost the key,btohqsg
So I got fuel economyOf 13.17 km a liter.,btohqsg
Give about 10%from this reading... 😁😁😁,btohqsg
I changed these aftermarket to original. Previous owner used these I don’t like this. Small sized.,btohqsg
Is there any way to remove it,btohqsg
Does workshop help you cut it,btohqsg
I thought you said you never pump 95 anymore 🫣🫣,btohqsg
But that means I have to buy new lug nuts,btohqsg
Yeah just remove it. Find a adaptor that fits. I suspect size 16,btohqsg
I said I never pump 98 in singapore,btohqsg
There are some places you can fill up 95 around Iskandar region.,btohqsg
Looks like 95 in malaysia to me..,btohqsg
Sinkie sia. Don't break rules can?,btohqsg
Is PML not doing well? Or feeding off competition,btohqsg
I got original Mazda nuts from Carousell seller.,btohqsg
Need to remove current ones first,btohqsg
Yes. Then remove them if you already found original,btohqsg
If no adapter must cut off no choice,btohqsg
Sir the whole issue is that he cannot remove them apart from chopping them off,btohqsg
Oh what I meant is singapore I don’t use ron98 at all. But in Malaysia I had no choice in broad daylight to buy ron97. But sometimes I would buy ron95 in stations that “permit”,btohqsg
Will bodykit shop help me cut,btohqsg
Why huh? Sorry I didn’t follow whole story.,btohqsg
Bodykit and wheelshops should be able to with an angle grinder but if they're not careful can damage your wheels,btohqsg
If you're sure about the dimensions  suggest you go for this and try it out,btohqsg
I’ll try to use this one first,btohqsg
Just sending out the usual sale messages like all other dealers,btohqsg
Got contact on good wheel shops?,btohqsg
LS tyre and top93 good places,btohqsg
but before that you were gone for 230+ messages 🫣,btohqsg
Sure..No mention of 98 at all in those text. Pump 95 is pump 95 in Msia. No need to hide your shame of a sinkie.,btohqsg
Later end up like that Sorento who escaped without paying,btohqsg
mitsuoka cars resale price very good. all those renew Coe ones still asking high,btohqsg
too rare. only seen twice on Sg roads,btohqsg
how do you determine if a second hand car is a good deal? is there any tips & tricks to negotiate with the dealer?,btohqsg
Must see what the market rate is for that model and then compare various units based on condition  time left  mileage  and your preference,btohqsg
Basis that you can rate the cars and rank them based on price,btohqsg
Negotiation is upto you and how you do it  if you do a PPI usually can ask them to do up the minor wear and tear included as part of the price,btohqsg
would it be better to pay by loan or pay whole sum? cause i heard that usually pay one shot the dealer will mark up or something...,btohqsg
Yes there's a slight mark-up as they do not earn the commission on securing loan,btohqsg
Don’t let them know how you’ll pay. Of course dealers expect you to use loans because that’s where they make a lot of money. Commissions etc. negotiate to the final price and then say you use cash. If they resist then ask them why.,btohqsg
These days many just want to sell quickly and move on,btohqsg
Check out 'Powerful Fuel Saver Surbo for most cars'  available at S$99 on#Carousellhttps://carousell.app.link/03XluDTXVqb,btohqsg
hi guys  is this even real?,btohqsg
some tell me its similar type of upgrade like doing “grounding” for cars,btohqsg
After visiting the website… I got no faith in the product,btohqsg
works for some car  some doesnt. depending if your car really needs the function.recently i up my rim size and my car feels slower in acceleration. thinking of ways to make it better.,btohqsg
ya  but after reading all the tech stuff.started to hesitate and wanting to believe the benefits 😅🥲,btohqsg
No surprise.A200 Salon 1 400cxMany on the road.*POSITIONING* 🚗  for Sales Representative 😜,btohqsg
It works  depending on how you want it to work,btohqsg
Someone explained it to me before,btohqsg
But honestly not worth it lah,btohqsg
thats one way to go kaboom,btohqsg
Big tyre company should have the adapter?Like AL Tyre?,btohqsg
i haven do  those are what ppl told me about this thingy,btohqsg
usually ah  this kinda funny funny thing i wont put ba because its dodgy and sometimes might be placebo,btohqsg
wah this one hard to stage 1😅😅,btohqsg
NA car where got stage 1/2/3,btohqsg
turbo illegal in sg right? 😅,btohqsg
NA potential not high  plus u have to programme hybrid,btohqsg
It’s only illegal of you get caught,btohqsg
Let’s be real  if you TP  you will stop a 2018 fit meh,btohqsg
illegal only when police present. Police not here  habibi everything legal,btohqsg
Turbo after 5 yr will cost leak. N.A better,btohqsg
if you want  can try throttle controller. It will increase throttle sensitivity and in some way feel faster,btohqsg
its faster la but abit only lor,btohqsg
Of cos. Fit and Jazz no.1 target by LTA😅,btohqsg
recently did body kit to look more sporty  probably low chance but still got chance ba,btohqsg
I think high chance got other car they want stop 🫣,btohqsg
Or just put open pod then tune,btohqsg
Atleast got the shiok suction sound,btohqsg
imo nothing much you can do ba  if you want can try lor but personally i wouldnt try,btohqsg
Not good..  must cover. If not become hot air intake.Fit suction is done very well already. Direct cold air intake from front.Just change Hurricane Filter can already.,btohqsg
Once you start  hard to stop,btohqsg
after i up my rim  my car slower. feels sad,btohqsg
It’s a hole that you never stop digging,btohqsg
if you cant go fast  look fast,btohqsg
also fit CVT  abit dangerous ba,btohqsg
"15"" best for fit. SSR or Rays.195/55r15195/50r15",btohqsg
Look at all this poisonous people,btohqsg
All the horns come out already,btohqsg
His one is DCT fit hybrid,btohqsg

U go White Snail Facebook and see what he do for Jazz.Don't need do too much.,btohqsg
195/50r15 can get PS4 very good tyre 👍,btohqsg
The coilovers to drop it abit,btohqsg
i see alr straight away give way,btohqsg
You need to learn how to tame the beast,btohqsg
But most important is to make sure you have backup savings,btohqsg
Just in case something major happened  touch wood,btohqsg
yea  i do my car modifications with my “bonus” only,btohqsg
I know some people that borrows money cause no money to fix their vehicle 🙈🙈,btohqsg

recently i changed from idemitsu 0w20 to Motul Hitech,btohqsg
Oooo I’ve heard good things about motul,btohqsg
But honestly  I don’t feel the difference between different brands,btohqsg
U vulgar. You show me Andy Lau middle finger,btohqsg
Just my wallet can feel the difference,btohqsg
but im planning to change back idemitsu on next servicing  personally feels more smooth,btohqsg
Very good.All Honda focus. workshop using this.SK garage.He recently won Malaysia Championship Series. Civic type r.He using this oil.,btohqsg

Cannot finished parcel will kena penalty 😅,btohqsg
Need to fund my zhng lifestyle,btohqsg
any idea how much it cost to do in SG?or go msia do better,btohqsg
Do SG. Malaysia not much experience on fit hybrid. They don't even know where your clutch fluid.Clutch fluid is Dot4 break fluid 500ml needed 35-40$Honda ATF 1.2litre only some workshop $88 . Inclusive laborOf cos cheaper if you buy the oil online.,btohqsg
my mileage 65k currently  not sure if previously done DCT oil change or not,btohqsg
Is Kia Sonet a good car? Thinking of getting a compact suv,btohqsg
Technology car at low price tag. Power wise ok I think nor the best,btohqsg
Tough decision.. my car coe is almost up,btohqsg
Not sure if getting a second hand GLA180 is worth it since it’s around the budget of mine,btohqsg
u planning to keep long term till end of COE?,btohqsg
No idea what is this but it seems similar to an air intake + throttle body spacer combined? For the low price of $99  take the benefits with a pinch of salt.Having installed a throttle body spacer and silicone air intake  I’ve noticed a slight improvement in pick up at low and mids but I wouldn’t say it’s life changing or fuel saving.,btohqsg
If I were to buy gla180 then it’s for the long run,btohqsg
then dont buy. If you think you can get a cheaper car now and save more money  maybe 2-3 years down the road you can get a car better than GLA,btohqsg
thats my personal preference to keep upgrading ba,btohqsg
Actually I was going to buy Kia cerato gt but the price is now same as compact suv,btohqsg
cerato good leh haha  very good looking,btohqsg
Ya Lor but not very convenient as I have kid coming soon,btohqsg
the cerato feel more solid than the sonet? i havent tried to sonet before,btohqsg
That’s why I’m looking at compact suv,btohqsg
I like the design of sonet but made in India…,btohqsg
Not sure how good their production is,btohqsg
i going kia tmr  i will see for my ownself haha,btohqsg
Test drive the sonet for me,btohqsg

Audi A3 sportback 1 litre . Good buy ?,btohqsg
Haha . No . Coe all car no good buy lo,btohqsg
No la. Got rise n drop,btohqsg
Coe is like an ascending wedge go down also won't go as low as 2018 25k,btohqsg
Cause income go up a lot,btohqsg
From 6-14 % in a year,btohqsg
There are around 1.37 m house hold in Singapore,btohqsg
So basically is 197280 household that declared income earning over 20 k a monthTotal car population is 600 k including phv,btohqsg
U count your self lol some got 2-3 cars for the top 5%,btohqsg
Some towkays have the saying they are slave to their workers… not sure how true. 🤣,btohqsg
Very true for SMEs.Worker no show. MIA😅,btohqsg
And some don’t even declare income haha,btohqsg
Progressive coe should applied to those can afford two or three cars.,btohqsg
I also 3 cars  one cx8  one left kar and one right kar,btohqsg
Kena throw down in parliament. That why 220% ARF on 80k omv,btohqsg
I think I just 1 car will do and don’t take loan,btohqsg
2nd car coe should be 150% followed by 200% for 3rd car,btohqsg
This one no impact at all.,btohqsg
Wont la cause buying car won’t affect,btohqsg
But then  they can register using different owner,btohqsg
I think company road tax higher?,btohqsg
So it is the wannabe rich in the public sectors throwing the policy out,btohqsg
One household have 3 cars is a must 😂,btohqsg
Yes and pointless to control also as our policy is a car lite policy,btohqsg
Sadly i fall under the 2.0%  life has been tough. Petrol so expensive  still wanna raise GST😢😢,btohqsg
So might just want till let top 20% own car will do,btohqsg
U are those didn’t declare salary 1 is if,btohqsg
Which also the argument that they don’t drive all cars at the same time for those registered under same name.,btohqsg
if you increase COE by 120k  so basically 220k  it will solve the issue,btohqsg
They lump everything above $20k together,btohqsg
Actually I agree that 20 k is too low for too bracker,btohqsg
people who own japanese cars will not buy a car anymore,btohqsg
I give u kantao  can earn $10k per meetup,btohqsg
Clearly the quantum in disparity of wealth gaps are huge,btohqsg
Even income tax now have new bracket up to 1 m,btohqsg
Small sum increment for the top.,btohqsg
Richest person I know drive a sienta,btohqsg

They are smart people. Why spent on one farking expensive car when one can just wack on multiple for the convenience.,btohqsg
No is he not intreasted in car,btohqsg
He got private yatch and such,btohqsg
Last time bought a private jet in China,btohqsg
But he still need a car to move around. So keep low profile 😅,btohqsg
why u nvr ask him buy tesla,btohqsg
Never contact for some time lioa   last time I try to bid his project,btohqsg
He must be the type to eye on assets to grow.,btohqsg
Some rich ppl just want to act poor time to blend in,btohqsg
Kena thrown in Parliament mah.Argued mahAlready paidCOEARFGSTAlso  follow TDSR .,btohqsg
Paid coe for 1 car but 2nd car onwards the coe value goes higher…,btohqsg
I am think I am at the edge of poverty when meeting such ppl,btohqsg
They buy building also no loan,btohqsg
Increase income tax 40% like Australia.Work wonders 😂👍No money how to buy cars,btohqsg
Increase tax means something have to be gifted. Like free education and medical,btohqsg
Rich knows how to move money around in a global economy right? 😅,btohqsg
Like I run a buisness I only will pay myself up to a certain income to avoid hitting the 320 k range after tax relief,btohqsg
Then other pay thru company dividend that is 17%,btohqsg
Singapore lowest. Every others moving money here.You move out? 😂Switzerland negative interest.South Korean 55% estate taxSingapore 0%,btohqsg
Pay $1 also can. All expenses parked under company. No profit how to tax. 😂,btohqsg
For what there is tax rebate like cpf   ns relief   child relief   max can get 60 k tax reduction for chargeable income,btohqsg
And charity rebates is the best joke,btohqsg
To me it is ideal to pay like 360 k a year before tax then after relief of 40 k is just nice 320 k lol,btohqsg
More then that use company dividends to pay,btohqsg
The big companies also play such things to reduce tax liability,btohqsg
Move people around the world to do that,btohqsg
No la I am very bad and lazy on such haha,btohqsg
Remember to test drive sonet 😂,btohqsg

If Lambo is budget  then Honda is wad?,btohqsg
Lambo shortchange sia. HUD also don’t hv,btohqsg
and i feel hud abit too extra,btohqsg
hud is like eating $15 chicken rice at restaurant,btohqsg
good for your regular daily cars  lambo cabin already so small  where got space to use for HUD and no need also  the instrument cluster right there,btohqsg
no need look down oso can see,btohqsg
Nowadays new cars u tell me which dash not big,btohqsg
I think Lambo owners got shortchanged seriously,btohqsg
alot of the exotics no hud de,btohqsg
Koenigsegg oso no hud. pagani oso dun have,btohqsg
HUD is a must have. Whether u want to use or not is up to u. If not u r shortchanged,btohqsg

Lambo you don't pay for music system  HUD  etc.,btohqsg
You pay for the driving pleasure and the engine,btohqsg
Next time you put this in your Lambo ok?,btohqsg
I want all. Whether I on the music or hud is up to me. But the options must be there. If not ppl will ask me why Lambo music n hud also don’t hv,btohqsg
When They buy  they never choose the hud option,btohqsg
Good for you! You send us pictures when you buy Lambo with HUD next time. We clap for you!,btohqsg
It’s common sense. U pay millions for a car without basic stuffs like music n hud?,btohqsg
Yes  because you sit in the car you don't want music. Listen to the sweet V10 sound is good enough,btohqsg
Plus it does come with a music system,btohqsg
I want both. Whether I on the music or hud is up to me,btohqsg

Can organise a car party to Thailand ?,btohqsg
Anybody looking for iqos or heets pm cod 👍,btohqsg
Non HUD car can join also? 🤣🤣,btohqsg
I drove the Niro about 300km on my holiday this week. Good acceleration and features and I can see the draw as a mass market family point A to point B ride. Quiet cabin and comfortable.  However if I were to compare it with performance ICE cars  it definitely lacks the engagement  sharpness and drive experience ICE performance cars bring. Not an apple to apple comparison here I know 😅😅 and it has no HUD 😕,btohqsg
Sir I can see it for the Urus but not really on the other models. The sitting position is already so low and dash is literally sitting higher than on most road cars such that you don’t really need to look down per se?,btohqsg
Ok probably I’m a short dude too that’s why 😅,btohqsg
On hifi  Lambo have sound system and with all due respect to other car makes  it has become a marketing point by car makers to help sell their cars nowadays. However on Lambo I don’t think they need to boast having an xyz hifi brand on board to help sell their cars. At least not for me.,btohqsg
Besides  to enjoy hifi quality  one needs a certain quietness to the cabin and that is not quite what one gets in a Lambo. Or carpet ride quality.,btohqsg
It is never one for me anyway. Have sound can already. Our journeys are so short in Singapore too. Hifi are best enjoyed in the comfort of home! 😄😄,btohqsg
It’s a basic thing all new cars have now. Whether ppl use them or not it’s up to them. But the options must be there,btohqsg
Many new cars have 4 seats too,btohqsg
Don’t make excuses for Lambo to shortchange u,btohqsg
A huracan doesn't? Does that mean Lambo shortchanged them?,btohqsg
U don’t come n compare Apple to orange,btohqsg
Yeah lah  so you compare performance car to performance car what,btohqsg
You tell me which supercar got HUD,btohqsg
It is not shortchanging. Many new cars still don’t have no?,btohqsg
It’s all on the spec sheet then you buy.,btohqsg
U donno doesn’t mean don’t have,btohqsg
U 2 Don’t spoilt the mkt by compromising,btohqsg
It’s clearly stated. Short change is when they say it’s there  then not there when you take delivery.,btohqsg
Y don’t the 2 of u request don’t want everything,btohqsg
Because that's what most buyers of that car pay for,btohqsg
U can make the car seats urself right,btohqsg
U don even need the door,btohqsg
Not at all. I do like how you place HUD as number one priority on your own shopping list. To many  it is mainly a good to have option.,btohqsg
Ok among the top. Sorry I stand corrected.,btohqsg
It’s not even among the top,btohqsg
Becos u r forsaking basic things in Lambo n even justify for them,btohqsg
Not at all sir. I’m saying for other car makes too. There is a purpose for each installation and each buyer has his own list of what’s important or not. For example if the careful buyer does want to be up for a $1-2k min replacement cost on a unit he doesn’t really need then he may be ok without it.,btohqsg
I wish they did  then I would use that money to buy a Lambo myself,btohqsg
A bit like soft close mechanisms. It is nice to have but replacement cost of each is about $600-900 depending on car make and model.,btohqsg
i would like to remind you  some porsche GT doesnt even come with doorhandles,btohqsg
Short change is to me maybe … buying a new Porsche and getting maybe only 4 cylinders.. 😂😂😂,btohqsg
For a Lambo a high tech futuristic car  y do u want to compromise on basic stuffs? Stop spoiling the mkt n shortchange urself.,btohqsg
Wahahah but we do need to move with times.,btohqsg
