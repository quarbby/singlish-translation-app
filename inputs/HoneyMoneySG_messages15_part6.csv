Are platforms like Cardup using DBS women card considered online shopping? To qualify for $2k 4mpd.And also citi rewards $1k 4mpd?Was thinking of setting up recurring payments on cardup for the miles so i dont forget and ease of management. Any idea anyone?,btohqsg
Any suggested platforms on achieving the 10X points?,btohqsg
does t-bills also have quota like SSB or it is unlimited ?,btohqsg
similar platforms like ipaymy also does not give 10x pts. only spending on relevant MCCs will give the 10x points,btohqsg
Same for citirewards?I guess best bet would be to use those two cards on shopee and grab directly?Forgoing the grab points/shopee points makes more sense right?,btohqsg
Yes  as those are online spendings. For offline spendings you can use Amaze+CRMC can convert to online.,btohqsg

WWMC and CRMC give 10x points for online spend and relevant spends. 1.2mpd is for those card such as dbs alt or CPM,btohqsg
DBS alt and CPM can earn 1.2mpd on cardup  if you are interested,btohqsg
Oh you mean CRMC i can use top up to Amaze? Every mth top up $1k and i earn the 4mpd?,btohqsg
No top ups  you link it to amaze and spend on amaze. Amaze will bill CRMC directly when you tap your amaze card.,btohqsg

pretty sure he said no top ups,btohqsg
It’s different top ups i was referring to in different messages,btohqsg
One is to top up amaze and one is to top up grab. Was just clarifying,btohqsg
