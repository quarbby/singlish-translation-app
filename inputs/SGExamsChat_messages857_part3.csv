I had to get them to open it up for me yes.,btohqsg
They locked everything up and basically panicked when I sent them an attachment offer letter,btohqsg
For mine i rmb they were shocked that i did not have any knowledge about an internship briefing,btohqsg
It's in the emails from CAO that they spam us daily,btohqsg
They forgot to include me inside lmao,btohqsg
No like there was an internship briefing that talked about how to apply inplace and stuff like that,btohqsg
Idk i never received it too,btohqsg
I never used inplace to apply so ngl I am unfamiliar with it,btohqsg
But the point i am making is CAO is literally on an island separate from all schools,btohqsg
The funny part is that they are located in an area where no one wld see them,btohqsg
Yeah ik I went there and found my CAO admin there,btohqsg
Nah i read somewhere that intern results only comes out 2-5 months after completion of internship,btohqsg
Oh chey u mean that one?https://entuedu.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/Student/dept/sasd/oas/Shared%20Documents/ExamAndAssessment/Assessment/Release_of_course_results_undergraduate_education.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=mRgkqq,btohqsg
doesnt results in this case mean like the pass/fail results?,btohqsg
you need that to graduate  no?,btohqsg
in this case there's no way i can do a y4s2 and still attend convo,btohqsg
U need your degree audit to show 0 for all to graduate,btohqsg
We are not taking this risk,btohqsg
Your PA/PI/EPI results will be released 2 to 5 months after the end of your internship.,btohqsg
Yeah this was made clear if u ask or attend any CAO workshops,btohqsg
Aint nobody got time for dat,btohqsg
Imo cannot cuz the Academic advisor can drag their feet,btohqsg
Essentially after intern is finish u submit the assessments your academic supervisor can take their own sweet time until the deadline to submit your results,btohqsg
why not graduate with your seniors?,btohqsg
Oh that ship wld have sailed long time ago,btohqsg
Well tbh we can graduate in 3.5 yrs,btohqsg
But like that decision can only be made in yr 1,btohqsg
tfw laptop prices are dropping now,btohqsg
mostly because of new laptop refreshes coming in April.,btohqsg
need to clear out the old stock,btohqsg
I had a delulu guy tell me he wants to graduate in 2.5 years,btohqsg
Yeah  the newer devices are coming out at a much faster now. Laptops  desktop computers & phones as well,btohqsg
I would have been fine with his claims but his calculations factors in FYP at 6months..,btohqsg
Actually tbh he cld have just shift his fyp back by 1 sem...,btohqsg
Not reduce the fyp to 6 months,btohqsg
U need Y4 standing for that,btohqsg
It's literally impossible to hit like 95 AUs in 3 semesters,btohqsg
Yea that wld probably be like an engineering major loaf,btohqsg
Yeah idk how would u convince an admin to willingly give u 32 AUs,btohqsg
If your gpa is very very good,btohqsg
what if i just want to speed run my degree,btohqsg
He's in humanities with me but as a single major,btohqsg
So assuming he maximise each mod overload at 4AU per.. u would have to request for 4 mod overload ONTOP of your normal sem load..,btohqsg
Ouh yea then that is impossible,btohqsg
if from Diploma maybe get credits transfer?tbh  I prefer students have real world experience rather than stuck in Uni too long.,btohqsg
Just double your money what's wrong with that,btohqsg
That will be my third SG group ban,btohqsg
Then i was like Wait irwen is alr here,btohqsg
If irwen is here why is this guy not banned yet,btohqsg
Looks like April is the time to buy newer laptops ..rumours saying airtag 2 might come out,btohqsg
