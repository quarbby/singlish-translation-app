let down by the gearbox unfortunately,btohqsg
arguably the BS is nicer than the DTM,btohqsg
hmm its nice but I wouldnt say nicer but the same level I guess,btohqsg
but once you see the curves you start getting hints that it's not normal,btohqsg
indeed. and the front bumper vents,btohqsg
see this@tunaaonigirisuddenly quiet bcause she only know the amg gtr,btohqsg
very tastefully done up not too obvious but not too subtle,btohqsg
kinda wish they made the S211 E63 to a larger scale too.,btohqsg
clk dtm clk63 is the real raw amgsðŸ˜’ðŸ˜’,btohqsg
i dont get what was the point of pinging meðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Love these but not a big fan of the tails,btohqsg
no idea why merc did away with the fender gills. really subtle,btohqsg
i think this was the PFL E63?,btohqsg
i like the sedan tails more,btohqsg
I feel the oval tails dont rlly fit the car,btohqsg
they evolved and took to land so the gills disappeared like what happened during the ice age,btohqsg
i think the estate tails never *really* looked that good.,btohqsg
pls come and help me gluglugluglugluglug,btohqsg
the 212 and 213 are neat,btohqsg
digging the pics out from my archive ðŸ˜—,btohqsg

Underrated but e200's kompressors are slept on,btohqsg

Iridium Silver W213 E250 Avantgarde is the best,btohqsg
E200 Kompressor the 4 door so cool tbh it gives off mafia vibes,btohqsg

Literally same rear end as the redesigned GTðŸ’€,btohqsg
