Will be a little challenging to put a positive spin on thisâ€¦,btohqsg
why lay off? The manager insist to WFH?ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
"Tesla has introduced a worldwide hiring freeze and they're cutting down on ""non essential"" roles already",btohqsg
Wonder how it's gonna pan out with the new model Y orders,btohqsg
Heard there's already confusion about COE bidding with different Tesla reps telling customers different things,btohqsg
Oh man.. pls donâ€™t further complicate a straightforward processâ€¦,btohqsg
Musk is a ang mor with Asian work ethics.,btohqsg
Scary when country manager becomes non essential ..,btohqsg
It's an easy way for him to layoff ppl without having to pay them severance,btohqsg
But role eliminated so no replacement will be found,btohqsg
Donâ€™t plan on our extremely high monthly incomes being guaranteed for the period of car loan ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Won't be clear. Because now the ones flooding the roads and buying up coes are the PHVs and other car rental companies,btohqsg
Not even my favourite drinks stall aunty's assistant,btohqsg
People are still gonna be traveling  if they don't buy cars  roads will still fill up with more buses and more cabs,btohqsg
If you do see the COE going that high and people not buying cars,btohqsg
But that won't happen because the buying power of certain sections of society does increase as well,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve seen folks struggle with monthly payments and repair bills when they bank their lifestyle on continuous commissions and bonuses,btohqsg
ya sound like 2011 to 2014 all over again when grab expanded,btohqsg
Sourcing for viewpoints. YR2021 Tiguan 1.4A TSI or YR2021 BMW X1 sDrive18i. Comments?,btohqsg
Tiguan will offer you more space  x1 has a good driving experience,btohqsg
but the interior can be abit drab ah,btohqsg
tiguan might feel slightly underpowered but it does the job well,btohqsg
2021 quite nice  got ambient lighting all,btohqsg
dosent make much of a diff in the day time tho,btohqsg
but x1 the 2.0 model is nice,btohqsg
but the idrive a bit more reliable than the newer VAG infotainment units as they develop in house now,btohqsg
The big companies don't want you to drive your own car they want you to drive their cars,btohqsg
Thanks for the replies. Yes  Tiguan has more space. The X1 will be the 1.5L not the 2.0L (petrol expensive!). Any concern about reliability of the Volks these days? wet/dry DSG,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to search up my fine for fuel check? Canâ€™t seem to find on axs,btohqsg
i think the recent dsg is quite solid haha,btohqsg
quite solid nowadays. just need to maintain properly  don't skip on gearbox services as recommended by volkswagen,btohqsg
According to VAG they fixed the problems plauging the DQ200 dry 7DCT. But even after that  my friends Jetta GB gave way on CTE,btohqsg
weather too hot in Sg ... wet ones might survive longer,btohqsg
tiguan 1.5 shd be wet 6spd dsg,btohqsg
No clear indication if the tiguan 1.5 is wet or dry. That's probably the only thing that edges it towards the X1,btohqsg
Didnâ€™t know itâ€™s tagged to nric,btohqsg
cuz they know sgean change cars often hahah,btohqsg
oh yeah i was thinking of the old 1.4tsi,btohqsg
"Still pretty sad volks is still plagued with this ""unknown""",btohqsg
yeah so i think its 1.4 (old) vs 2.0 (new),btohqsg
oh crap which year was that jetta,btohqsg
wah help man my family was looking at a mk7.5 gti too haha,btohqsg
my friend's X1 burned down complete loss.. switched to 1.4 tiguan hahaha.,btohqsg
Not very familiar with VAG but the GB died in 2018,btohqsg
