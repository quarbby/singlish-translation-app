🎉Pika World Morning Flash🎉💰Equity markets move higher💎As we can see  the equity market rose sharply during the late trading session  defying early-ranging mode to end much higher. As a result  Pika World offloads some short-side options as we move into the Inflation Day- Release of CPI data.🪜Major indices broke resistance levels💵The S&P 500  in particular  broke above the 392 short-term resistance level  gunning for 396-397 before CPI. Most analysts expect a weaker CPI print which will be good news for the markets. A softer reading will allow the Fed to moderate its future rate hike momentum and let the bond yield drop or stop moving upwards slowly.On the currency side  it will also weaken the dollar  which is yet another tailwind for MNCs as they tend to do a bulk of their business in foreign currency  allowing them to book higher profit with a weaker dollar.CPI data will be released today at 9.30 pm Singapore time. So we shall see you till then!,btohqsg
Nowadays just interested in CPI  monthly employment n earnings data  Powell speeches.,btohqsg

ArionEnt actually safe Micro at current price for BBs  hope the BBs come in to buy and save me,btohqsg
Hung Mun Ho who invested S$0.00525 into Arion Ent in Aug 2020 sold his entire stake to Executive CEO at $0.006 yesterday  which explains yesterday unusual volume which they transacted on the open market.The CEO Ng Kai Man not bad  let this investor make a profit and added his stake from 6.6% to 13%.With this  it sets a psychological base of $0.006 for Arion Ent and perhaps it might be timely since Micros starting to be in favour. Those who can hold  can consider collect $0.006 (same price as insider)He dare to buy out an investors shows that he have confidence in ArionEnt future.Should be soon. Stay strong  we stuckists!,btohqsg
Recent CEO/Director bought $0.006 from this guy. Reminder to all BBs in the house,btohqsg
