Hi guys  if i use my Maybank Platinum Visa card to pay for my personal insurance through mobile axs  do I qualify for the quarterly cashback?,btohqsg
Just a word of caution that their online banking capabilities are quite lacking. Many things can only be done at the branch and cannot be done online  and unlike the local banks  there aren't many branches around. If you're not expecting much movement  then go right ahead.. but if you're expecting to do stuff with them regularly  it's probably not the most convenient.,btohqsg
Noted for this. Thks for advice! üòä,btohqsg
Any cards on the market that still award cashback/miles for town council payments?,btohqsg

Royal caribbean cruise buy from agents or direct cheaperüòä,btohqsg
Last time I booked through agent was 20% cheaper  and better room also. Just email your preferred date to the agent and let them quote you  no obligations.,btohqsg
Yes for both. In fact you can also link your Citi Rewards card directly to Shopback/Fave Pay for 4mpd - just make sure you don't pay through Apple Pay,btohqsg
So many funny things to remember. They just want to make sure u slip up and not get your miles,btohqsg
Does 2c2p payment to hotel work for dbs altitude to get 3mpd?,btohqsg

Anyone has experience with USD$aver of SC promotion? Good deal or a meh... üôè for ur views...,btohqsg

hi everyone  may i know is international card swipe count towards bigpay 10% cashback credit ?,btohqsg
Firstly  you won't get 10X rewards point because hotel is an excluded spend category.,btohqsg
There is a Citibank adv on<ADV> Spend your next holiday with Citi Credit Cards and offset your foreign transaction fee! Charge a min. of S$3 000 in foreign currency spend to your eligible Citi Credit Cards and receive 3.25% cash rebate. Valid from 19 Apr 23 till 30 Jun 23.I don't know if it works if I charge to hotel,btohqsg
Secondly  yes but you likely would not see the additional charge reflected as a separate line item. In general  the fx spread is bad for us and there are fees. Both would be reflected in the exchange rates.,btohqsg
In my personal opinion (the folks here can correct me)  after u nett off the fees and charges for charging foreign currency to your CRMC  might not be worth your effort.,btohqsg
Hello all! Do Chris or was there any discussion on best pairing of cards for oversea spending? Will be heading to Taiwan,btohqsg
Can i link ocbc titanium to instarem and use instarem on kris+?,btohqsg

Hi  for UOB preferred and HSBC revo... grab/zig/gojek qualifies for their 4mpd right?,btohqsg
