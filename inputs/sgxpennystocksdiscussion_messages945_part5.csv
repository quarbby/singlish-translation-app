AP Strategic got big news. Sizeable funds raised  similar to the likes of Jasper.Seems they want to join in the micro party,btohqsg
AP Strategic raising $6 267 000 funds from single big investor at $0.002 per share.This looks similar to the likes of Jasper.Seems they want to join in the micro party 🎉DYODD  hopefully a Jasper 2.0 in the making. Seems probable.Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/GN03LF475TB1BNOT/808303_APSIL%20-%20Placement%20Announcement-%20Final.pdf,btohqsg
Based on the announcement  it mentions that AP Strategic entered into subscription agreement on the 26th June 24 and the subscriber will pay the company in cash within 3 business days from this date.,btohqsg
Jasper came alive on a similar type of fund raising deal . It opened $0.002 on matching and then now it’s still hovering at $0.007/$0.008.Timely deal for AP Strategic. Does seems they want to get in on the micro hype. Anyways DYODD.,btohqsg

Diner in Taiwan vomits after biting into cockroach in braised tofu🤮The vendor allegedly offered to waive the fees  but the diner felt they were brushing over the matter.The stall in question is arguably one of the most famous braised pork rice stalls in Keelung City.👉https://tsl.to/cockroachtofu@mustsharenews,btohqsg
The reason that AP Strategic is undergoing this investment deal is to(1) raise additional capital for the proposed acquisition of Mobii Genius (2) Repay a term loan(3) working capitalAll in all  this looks like a strategic placement to a renowned investor  which is eerily similar to Jasper recent deal which saw price propelling from Zero to $0.008.Interesting  it is indeed. I believe it will come alive. But Whether  it will be like Jasper 2.0 or not? If only we know  right?Anyways DYODD  looks a decent gamble  with good RRR at current price.,btohqsg
For those keen to read up on AP Strategic RTO deal on Mobii Genius.Key things to note- Reason for this RTO being  investing in data centres to cater for the worldwide shortage of computing power driven by the increase in ‘AI’ usages- deal is based on new share issuance of $0.00483- Based on their findings  the investment in data centres in SEA is expected to increase to USD $14.19 billion in 2028Source:https://links.sgx.com/1.0.0/corporate-announcements/UJRPDAVY3YCS7VQJ/795071_APSIL%20RTO%20Announcement.pdf,btohqsg

Information on the subscriber for AP Strategic shares.The name is Carson Wen. Seems an Influential man with global connections.,btohqsg
Incoming investor for AP Strategic- Carson Wen as Founder of Bank is Asia (BVI) and BOA International Financial GroupSource:https://www.bankasia.com/en/profile-carson-wen.htmhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Wen,btohqsg
This fella Carson Wen definitely not some no name guy. Background does seems extremely solid too.From the looks of it  should be waking up AP Strategic and giving it the heart beat.DYODD . After some digging. Does looks like a potential Jasper 2.0.,btohqsg
Monday straight open 0.003 and above?,btohqsg
Should start $0.002/$0.003 IMO  since Carson is buying into AP Strategic at $0.002.Not very fair to him if they allow us to buy same price as him  after such a big placement announcement.Similar to Jasper they allowed  matching in $0.002   then ding dong $0.002 - $0.003. Making old holders impatient and throw back at costs and the rest is history. Those who stucked long in Jasper all happy to out $0.003 then  but now they sure pissed off seeing the price is $.0007/$0.008,btohqsg
Finally u can see ur capital back,btohqsg
Because Jasper really too incredible and AP Strategic similar type of news catalyst,btohqsg
Jasper monthly chart power pack indeed.,btohqsg
