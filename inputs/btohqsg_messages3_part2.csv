30 years short lease  for people above 55yo,btohqsg
But can see policy makers treat old folks very well,btohqsg
All the subsidies  choice in matured estate flats  priorities,btohqsg
would you prefer your mum of staying alone at her 4rm with her two stranger tenants and get passive rental income  or staying near you at a 2rm with total privacy?,btohqsg
Personally I would prefer her stay alone coz not many can tahan her,btohqsg
She will step on tenants toes endless.,btohqsg
So ya is really to each his own cases,btohqsg
Currently they still in 5rm 1980flat,btohqsg
anyway 2rm BTO is good enough even for couple without kids,btohqsg
I perfectly get 2rm. In fact it is way spacious than many of the shoeboxes I stayed in with large balconies and or aircon ledges,btohqsg
506sq 2rm HDB  some condo can squeeze 2bedroom in the same floor space!,btohqsg
My dream 2rm layout is like the video with double door entry bathroom but longish HS that can convert Murphy bed cum work desk. Become study and bedroom,btohqsg
I seen some 2.2m by 1.7m,btohqsg
my bathroom is one of the biggest at about 5sqm,btohqsg
Same here too... anyone managed to access to view the result?,btohqsg
I think result will be released on about 4 January 2021,btohqsg
Since 6 weeks since close applications,btohqsg
So SBF need to wait till Jan2021😌,btohqsg
Hihi; do we need to bring HLE letter during our 1st appointment?,btohqsg
Hi I can I know roughly how long will we know the grant amount we get ?,btohqsg
They told me during appointment is via email rite ?,btohqsg
2~3 weeks after your HLE application. And yes you'll be notified via email,btohqsg
Are u serious ? My hle application is on July n I took Aug 2020 bto I select my unit 23 nov till today still not sure of my grant .,btohqsg
you can login to your singpass to check too. did you submit all documents in July? because if you didn't submit all documents then HDB will mail a physical reminder to you asking you to upload everything before the cut-off date. if you missed that then you probably want to submit a new application,btohqsg
Yesyes my hle all approved unit selected also they ask me to waet for my grant result ... I went in to singpass already still doesn’t appear,btohqsg
then that I'm not sure already  sorry can't be too much of a help 😅maybe someone else in the group knows!,btohqsg
It’s ok alrite btw thanks for the effort,btohqsg
Can I know you apply HLE before 1st appointment or after the 1st appointment?,btohqsg
Do we need to wait for the ballot result letter then apply for HLE?Or we just apply for HLE before receive letter from HDB?,btohqsg
Up to u actually cause hle valid for 6 month,btohqsg
What I did is I apply 1st my hle then I apply for the bto launched,btohqsg
just apply since you have to do it eventually too  so why the drag lol,btohqsg
Nearer to your signing of agreement date.,btohqsg
Hi  I tried to search but couldn't find any other than a poll but is there a group for towner crest?,btohqsg
Hi  random question here. What if I were to change Job after my SBF application? Will there be any penalty?,btohqsg
penalty wise  only heard of paying up early for bank loan,btohqsg
probably the loan amount would be different if your salary is not the same,btohqsg
Hi  wanna ask..EHG n HLE is a separate grant right??,btohqsg
Enhanced Housing Grant (EHG) consolidates the Additional Housing Grant (AHG) and Special Housing Grant (SHG) to provide higher grant amounts at a higher income ceiling.,btohqsg
Can i ask:1. Will the HLE be reassessed when I collect the keys?2. When i collect my keys  will the AHG and SHG grant's income assessment be done again?,btohqsg
AHG and SHG combined to be EHG,btohqsg
Hi  is there a chat for melody spring nov 2018?,btohqsg
income assessment for grant is it during signing of LOA?,btohqsg
I can't remember is it during selection exercise or signing LOA,btohqsg
During selection exercise  thereafter they will inform the results nearer to the signing for LOA.,btohqsg
Once they approve  the grant will be automatically credited to your CPF OA,btohqsg
So there is no reassessment of grant,btohqsg
Anyone still waiting for SBF results?,btohqsg
they mentioned by end of dec right? ><,btohqsg
I believe shld be arnd 4 Jan that date  since applications closed on Nov 23 and sbf results take 6 weeks to release,btohqsg
