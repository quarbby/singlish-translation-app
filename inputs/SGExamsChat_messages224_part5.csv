3 said yes 6 said no so far,btohqsg
age definitely does not affect access  to education,btohqsg
I ask cuz partly I wanna do a research project on it and my brother is still sad over the fact that he is being judged,btohqsg
So it's like kill 2 birds W 1 stone hehe,btohqsg
but u hv to understand that people might see the age gap as something that could affect the project? (if poly or degree) but im sure if he can prove that he has the ability to do work  no one will really mind his age alr,btohqsg
Sorry if this is personal  but how much older is your brother compared to his peers?,btohqsg
same age also more common topics? it's inevitable,btohqsg
I got 18 year olds in my sec 4 class,btohqsg
Poly not uncommon to see people who r 2-3y older,btohqsg
Cause some people come from ITE,btohqsg
3 is not that big of an age haha as long as he uk interacts with more 17/18 year olds,btohqsg
I mean if an older foreigner is fine  shouldn't an older local be fine as well,btohqsg
Doesn't really matter  since u r just talking about age,btohqsg
He interact W my sis who is like 16 already having so much difficulties,btohqsg
he will be able to overcome that,btohqsg
Idk he talk to me like a kid tho I'm 18,btohqsg
i had a 22-23 yr old in my jc2 class,btohqsg
basically he will still hv a chance to meet ppl his age,btohqsg
i just think that he might have quite a bit of explaining to do since im sure ppl will ask him abt his age and all,btohqsg
unless ure like 30 years old talking to some 17/18 years old kids  idt it will be THAT awkw to start convos and stuff,btohqsg
Cuz another reason why I ask cuz,btohqsg
My bro put ite choices in his jae,btohqsg
Then he n level can go ite,btohqsg
I mean why shd those younger or older not be allowed to take education at a particular level?,btohqsg
I dont think people regularly ask about other people age thou  do they?,btohqsg
any form of education should be accessible to all  at any point in life  to anyone who are willing  as long as they qualify through merit,btohqsg
Well did U see moe? They have an age requirement to take Ns/Os/As,btohqsg
Then like age requirement to go uni too,btohqsg
Shd 9 year olds be allowed to take the O levels,btohqsg
Is it not a minimum age? Or is there a maximum age?,btohqsg
Like if they can und the material why not,btohqsg
There is no maximum age even,btohqsg
Maximum age given to go ITE.,btohqsg
I don't think age really matters that much tbh,btohqsg
I saw 1 uncle wear uniform also,btohqsg
Ya if said individual is able to cope,btohqsg
Aron which JC you heading to??,btohqsg
Tbh i felt like i could have skipped Sec 1 and 2 and went straight to 3,btohqsg
Well frankly if somebody is too old,btohqsg
Nanyang hopefully  I'd cry in HCI  RI or ACSI,btohqsg
They’ll have difficulty relating to other members of the education system,btohqsg
I don't think it awkward still.,btohqsg
Does everybody seem to want nanyang,btohqsg
I can reach there in 30 mins and it starts at 8.30,btohqsg
I was pondering so heavily whether or not I should go for SAJC,btohqsg
I can't even go overseas study@chemcer,btohqsg
Don’t y’all want to go for US universities?,btohqsg
@chemcerok come meet me I let u read Ur fav textbook,btohqsg
Plus as Singaporeans we’ll have an advantage,btohqsg
Is it true that IB is better than A levels?,btohqsg
