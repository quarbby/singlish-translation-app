empty vessels make the most noise. The others who know just keep quiet,btohqsg
actually there are many who are not very good at numbersbut their high income more than made up for it,btohqsg
eg my sis  she doesn't invest. She and husband just have high income and went for EC. Bought 980k  neighbour just sold at 1.7m,btohqsg
without any actual investing  their assets up by 700k,btohqsg
then there's the $$ in cpf due to their high income. Easily can retire upon age 60,btohqsg
want to sell any of these financial instruments to them to tell them about retirement?,btohqsg
I don't have much in SA  so heck it,btohqsg
I made quite a fair bit of mistakes and still can average near 5% including SSBs  so I'm quite happy already,btohqsg
need more time to digest and think through,btohqsg
How exactly does this affect people?,btohqsg
Why wouldnâ€™t people just buy houses with their CPF money and liquidate it by selling it off?,btohqsg
Do something else with that money then  whatever that gives a comparable yield,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve read that youâ€™ll only be allowed to withdraw funds partially tho,btohqsg
guys can recruiters check criminal record via singpass,btohqsg
some recruiter guy send me singpass login link saying he need check if i gt criminal record,btohqsg

govt stuff will ask for everything,btohqsg
it may not even matter but it's their standard,btohqsg
ya i agree its a good price but then ofc you cant expect michelin star food. 5.90 for pasta is quite good though,btohqsg
depends on what you're applying for,btohqsg
if i'm applying for a job idt anything before uni is gonna matter lol,btohqsg
itd be very sad if someone reject from govt scholarship because of psle scores,btohqsg

Yes but are you actually affected,btohqsg
but any if yall got like job reccos that can SIT DOWN,btohqsg
There is demand for chinese teachers,btohqsg
i actually cant find any tho,btohqsg

write a book about your struggles,btohqsg
Iâ€™m pretty sure some banks do offer that  you can find 3.0% PA ones  and with that kind of money  4.0 and above is not a long shot (I could just be talking shit),btohqsg
everyone here have higher qualifications than me (its a fact btw im not trolling),btohqsg

I'm actly 3   it's just I'm a child prodigy that's why I'm able to even talk to ppl not ard my age,btohqsg
actually looking at how singpass API works this looks legit but it's ok if you'd wanna play it safe,btohqsg
idt they can know my criminal records via singpass,btohqsg
HUH. idt psle score matters after u get ur gce results lol,btohqsg
my experience is that only one education level down matters,btohqsg
so if you're applying for uni scholarship  then anything below jc is irrelevant,btohqsg
you can use singpass to login to SPF e services,btohqsg
ahh yea i was saying in general. u special,btohqsg
eh my teacher said undergrad scholarships look at sec3 - jc but more emphasid on jc part,btohqsg
cause like the us unis also look at sec 3 to jc,btohqsg
it's ok  you wont be those that finish jc with only psle,btohqsg
You seem to be very confident in my abilities to pass alvls,btohqsg
that's why see you lor. the link is actually a proper singpass link and not everyone can just generate it to access this type of secure info,btohqsg
