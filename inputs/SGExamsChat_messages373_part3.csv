people tryna tell others why the top schools arent actually good,btohqsg
I think the oldest here is@Corporate_shillwho’s like 20+ or@kohsyanthat’s all we know about,btohqsg
not bad learning environment. but I'd say it's comparable to neighbourhood schools. the teachers there were my teachers back then.  means it's been 10 years ++ that they've been teaching. they're there just for the sake of money and earning income. I honestly don't see the effort put in my the teachers based on wtv my sister tells me. and if any raffles kids here  sorry I'm putting the school in bad light but this is my honest opinion. the teachers know we have money  hence they'll be like NAHH THEIR GOOD THEY HAVE TUITION not all teachers are like that... but srsly that's how my sister describes school to me EVERY SINGLE DAY,btohqsg
The a private tutor in the other channel,btohqsg
ntg happen  u think the poor little girl wld speak up.. she wld even feel so ashamed doing so,btohqsg
That some people are smart and good at exams,btohqsg
I'd say the teachers are not it,btohqsg
and raffles don't even got affiliation,btohqsg
There is literally a logical fallacy about this,btohqsg
so there's not much benefits if you go raffles then...,btohqsg
no I tell u the bully is damn zao gao one,btohqsg
I think she meant pri sch or smt,btohqsg
ikr i thought theyre adults already,btohqsg
In jc people just pull nasty drama stunts,btohqsg
I mean ya I wld agree every sch have bullies but like the ppl there are just bullshit,btohqsg
Why Sia. It's not secondary school 2.0,btohqsg
there r good chers and bad chers in every sch,btohqsg
which u meet depends on ur luck,btohqsg
Limited to the schools you’ve been to is what I mean. Your entire impression of what’s a good and not good sch is only as accurate as where you’ve been,btohqsg
Or should I say primary school for grown ups,btohqsg
no srsly.. you know when I go inside the sch pick my sister up I tell u 3/4 of the teachers have been there for more than 10 years.. and from my mother . Who's a teacher  it's not good progress for the student or the school,btohqsg
you're in JC  being a bully is js immature alr,btohqsg
Being bullied previously to going to RJC where people supposedly treat you better definitely influences how you think of non raffles schools,btohqsg
sorry for pulling up a debate rn,btohqsg
I js got bored of ss,btohqsg
so the bad chers r there for long,btohqsg
but I might join debate club LOL,btohqsg
and hence the sch is bad,btohqsg
I never say the sch is bad  I js say the sch doesn't need to be glorified given its name,btohqsg
HAHAHA I NEVER SAY MY SCH BAD HOR,btohqsg
but some schools have more money,btohqsg
Literally no one is trying to dispute this. It’s about providing an equal perspective. RJC is good for you but you’re biased towards raffles as a whole,btohqsg
You can be happy with your own experience,btohqsg
every sch lacks budget i swear,btohqsg
coughmy sec school a bit excess,btohqsg
Lol they afford to repaint the entire school every year and always purchase a tons of new banners every year and all and sometimes with too much budget   they treat all chers to lunch,btohqsg
HAHAHA ACSI NOT EVEN EXCESS ITS JS too much,btohqsg
I like the chem jokes tho,btohqsg
DUDE BUT EJC IS DESIGNED LIKE HEAVEN,btohqsg
Bro goes to a jc for food☠️,btohqsg
most impt part of sch is the infrastructure + ppl arnd u,btohqsg
eh btw  im curios how the sch got such high cop when they recently opened like what gives the sch high cop,btohqsg
THE BUILDING IS LIKE ECO AND GOT PARK CONNECTER UNDER,btohqsg
LMAO MY GUY I GO UR SCH FOR U,btohqsg
AND LIKE 10 times BETTER THAN LIBRARY WITH SCRENERY,btohqsg
o ya all the good schs,btohqsg
I suppose from the students that apply there  then they just take as much as the capacity allow  let's say 500 then those 500 scores become COP,btohqsg
IT WAS DAMN HOT BUT SOME ECONSTUFF MAKE IT HELLA WINDY AND COOL WITH PLANTS,btohqsg
but for jae students  what makes a student wanna go there,btohqsg
cus Joel exists and go bcz of the food,btohqsg
