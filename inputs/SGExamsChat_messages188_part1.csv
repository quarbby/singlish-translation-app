I drew like that sia got 1 mark or no? I gave legend too,btohqsg
some dont require it  some do,btohqsg
Wait isn't the whole thing wrg,btohqsg
oxygen should also share 2 electrons,btohqsg
Uh i dont think its supposed to be like that,btohqsg
what u drew was a 'dative' bond,btohqsg
at least you drew a cute bond,btohqsg
Yes Bedok Viewan is very capable of that,btohqsg
pure chem i heard ppl got baited by beth and the q2 equation 2 for nitrogen dioxide,btohqsg
The one that ask u find which is wrong,btohqsg
I wrote dilute acid instead of concentrated,btohqsg
Cant go seab beat them up to ask to change back my answers anyways,btohqsg
Can somebody explain this concept to me,btohqsg
Go watch youtube video on it,btohqsg
The higher refractive index results in a smaller critical angle,btohqsg
So lower probability of achieving those angles,btohqsg
But how does that affect total internal reflection,btohqsg
the errors are step 3  5 and 7,btohqsg
step 3 the error shld be the warming part,btohqsg
reaction of conc h2so4 and iron is heavily exothermic,btohqsg
ok first of all do you understand the meaning of total internal reflections,btohqsg
i mean just assume it as a normal reaction lor,btohqsg
no need think too deep one,btohqsg
if u argue that conc h2so4,btohqsg
yep so i guess if u write dilute it shld be ok,btohqsg
Whether acid metal reaction give u fe2+ or fe3+,btohqsg
cos conc will probably cos fe to become fe3+ instead of fe2+,btohqsg
I ask my teacher before about iron and acid reaction  cos got two oxidation state  he say just put Fe2+   but he accepted both Fe3+ and Fe2+,btohqsg
i think need warm a bit also to introduce reaction also,btohqsg
Large quantity of water is wrong.IDT u're suppose to warm the solution cos it's alr super conc,btohqsg
And crystal shld be green issit,btohqsg
No  refractive index is speed of light in vacuum divided by the speed of light in the medium,btohqsg
lmao i didnt even notice the wrongcolors,btohqsg
Wait isnt iron ii sulfate FeSo4,btohqsg
i believe this qn is just,btohqsg
O lebel no need to know this,btohqsg
Iron 2 or 3 still can what,btohqsg
ah aside from steps error is also got written error,btohqsg
i think if the error is fair u shld get the marks,btohqsg
yep from the looks of it,btohqsg
Large quantity of waterCrystal should be green not brownWrong formulaShouldn't warm the concentrated solution,btohqsg
Ya everytime i just write acid cher ask to write dilute acid,btohqsg
I also think of the formula at furst,btohqsg
tbh idt u will get penalised ba as long as u include the formula being wrong also,btohqsg
True  but I don't think that's the answer they were aiming for,btohqsg
i believe they wanted students to also identify that the formula is wrong,btohqsg
Conc acid cannot warm ncos can splatter and very explosive,btohqsg
but idt any student will write it,btohqsg
Is like changing the expeirment reagent,btohqsg
u will prob be mentioned in examiner report then !!,btohqsg
