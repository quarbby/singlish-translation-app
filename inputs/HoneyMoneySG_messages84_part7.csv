Hi all. Will I still earn miles with my cmrc if I use grab paylater?,btohqsg
Where u get this? I don’t have.,btohqsg
Got it. So if I deduct straight from credit card  it should give me 10x points yeah?,btohqsg
Can you make it deduct from credit card?,btohqsg
Haven't try. Ill have to test it out,btohqsg
Linking your card to Grab PayLater just authorises them to top-up Grab Wallet to pay for your Grab PayLater bill.So no  you won't earn miles from topping up GrabPay Wallet.,btohqsg
Oh 😳. Thanks for the heads-up!,btohqsg
Hope you haven't tried it yet,btohqsg
If i not wrong  you can only participle in 1 out of 3.Kindly call their support to confirm this promo shown in your app.,btohqsg

@ChrisHMSGhi just saw ur latest vid - tx for the info! however im not familiar w youtrip and can’t remember seeing an in depth vid abt it - would you consider another vid sharing the pros & cons vs other similar apps? tyvm!,btohqsg

Need not have XNAP logo  I tried with a few stalls. No XNAP logo but can still work with XNAP.,btohqsg
what logo do they have? Liquidpay?,btohqsg
tx for ur quick reply! just saw the vid - ok conclusion is Amaze/Instarem is still the better option for multi currency expenses yes? that’s the one i’m using now since watching one of ur Amaze introduction vids. 😄,btohqsg
The usual paynow and etc logo. I was just testing and it worked with some hawker stalls.,btohqsg
By luck if they never update their logo to have XNAP or LiquidPay,btohqsg
Some of these stalls are early adopters of the SGQR cashless payment. Their QR code didn't change but they did not update it.,btohqsg
yeah  unless there are specific FX spend promos,btohqsg
