Any course works as long as there is a good career path for the diploma and (hopefully) a good experience with people there as that would forge interest into the subject,btohqsg
Can you not choose to take the old syllabus as a private candidate?,btohqsg
hey you can dm me anytime u hv doubts and i try my best to answer your qns since poly is starting next mon.,btohqsg
Idk but i thought theres always an option  its not an immediate change  no?,btohqsg
I can confirm this is a no from my old teachers who told me numerous times,btohqsg
its getting late I'll let the question marinate and pray more insight is given tmr,btohqsg
Rp as the backup plan if you drop out of np or sp,btohqsg
I thought it‚Äôs like every 2 weeks now,btohqsg
Hi! I am a rp student who just finished y1 sem1. Looks like u do feel strongly against RP- but I don't think it is really that bad üò≠. Introverts still can stick to their own study routine and the journal part is more lenient now. There are more good people than bad people but it depends on who u interact with really. And I just hope u put rp as ur last option just in case,btohqsg
this is for a project u guys can vote if uw,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm a y3 student about to start my final sem in rpRp is the school for connections  they cycle your classes every sem to the point  80% of your old classmates won‚Äôt follow you through 2 sems.It‚Äôs harder to mantain gpa because there is a bellcurve to certain mods. The weekly grading system means you also have to be consistent throughout your semester  the quizes you may have to do every few weeks weighs heavily. Finally dependent on mod  you will either have a project or a independent exam at the middle of semester or end of semester. Usually projects will yield higher results compared to examsDaily journals will turn from daily to weekly and to a few each month for each mod as you progress through the years.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing! How would you rate life in rp as compared to secondary school life or other polytechnics?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a really good poly to form connections  you will meet people from all different backgrounds  people from far away lands  poly dropouts form other places. They all will also have differing views on education but the key thing most want to leave rp with is a good few years of their life etc. never personally been through other poly systems so I can‚Äôt really comment on that but my neighbourhood secondary school experience is nowhere near my poly experince.In terms of what I‚Äôve learnt  what I‚Äôve made and how much I feel like I did. Poly life in rp is as ‚Äúown time  own target‚Äù as it gets,btohqsg
can consider MI. if you live in east  consider TP otherwise NP  NYP  RP,btohqsg
every school is a good school,btohqsg
but some schools are good-er than others,btohqsg
When I see MI suddenly Lestin  Irwen and rumchel pops into view,btohqsg
I just get summoned for no reason when those 3 appear,btohqsg
It's the four horseman but more shit,btohqsg
Dr Lee Wei Ling  daughter of the late founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew  has died at the age of 69.https://str.sg/w2vkC,btohqsg
Lol if I say YI how uh,btohqsg
Is it better to enroll in yishun jc or poly if i get 17?,btohqsg
Cause cutoff point can make it,btohqsg
Yishun Innova jc is actually worse than MI,btohqsg
Honestly I would say it depends uh,btohqsg
If you are unsure which courses to go to  I would recommend jc more than poly,btohqsg
those YI students got nothing better to do post bad reviews about MI,btohqsg
Or like if let say you interested in like a theoretical degree kind  or like if you interested in like law or medicine kind  jc would be ok (not saying poly is not ok but in terms of like academic requirements  jc would be slightly easier),btohqsg
But then if you are definite about jc  you really need to study hard for this one,btohqsg
What if i accidentally ate 4 tablets of panadol instead of 2,btohqsg
Oh yea but just saying uh  if you definitely sure you want to enter a certain industry like computer sci  business  engineering etc  and wanna learn something more applied  poly is more suited,btohqsg
Esp since is more geared to working life rather than university  though  you can also enter uni via poly route,btohqsg
Poly harder to enter Uni if the uni course is like 90RP or smth just go JC,btohqsg
Although 90RP and YI is like that 1 guy the myth the legend,btohqsg
I think quite hard to get 90 uh  mostly cus of PW and GP.,btohqsg
But now they change so who knows,btohqsg
4.0 harder and is like legit impossible imo for competitive courses in Poly,btohqsg
If your final goal is Uni just go JC and take the gamble and pain,btohqsg
Then go Private Uni or cry lor,btohqsg
go a&e if u feel like u r gonna die ig,btohqsg
I forget what happens.Could you take another 2 and let me know?,btohqsg
Lai come i can write a GP essay on MI already. It is the worst school in singapore currently thanks to the changes in a level grading system,btohqsg
Year 2  that focuses only on H1s is literally useless now,btohqsg
everything from teaching to resources is extremely subpar,btohqsg
only redeeming factor is teachers and even that can be hit or miss,btohqsg
i wanna apply for driving license,btohqsg
bbdc? ssdc? or js go private?,btohqsg
