Hi experts  OCBC 360 have this grow portion  giving you extra 2.4% but need to maintain daily average balance of $200 00  is it worth it?Assuming I managed to hit Salary + Save + Growâ€¦ EIR is 6.4%?,btohqsg
Read the tnc. The other interest rewards only covers up to 100k. You canâ€™t compute the EIR in this way.,btohqsg
Hi guys! Can I check if I  take grab does it count for 4mpd for HSBC revolution?,btohqsg
If maintained $200k sgd asset  the card fee will continue to be waived yearly,btohqsg

I go and read the TnC for UOB Lady's card. It was stated 'AMAZE*TRANSIT'. I don't think it include Amaze spendings.I read from an online source that only UOB Reserve Card stated exclusion for 'AMAZE*' wef 1 Oct 2024.Hopefully  the exclusion for 'AMAZE*' won't be cascaded down to the other cards the folks here have.Correct me if I'm wrong ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Not updated yet. The one in web is June version. Usually applies to all cards,btohqsg
Keeping our fingers crossed that UOB would take long long to update and  make public announcements. Mindful that it is a matter of time UOB would apply the change across all its mastercards,btohqsg
UOB reserve has mastercard? I read ML article its visa infinite?,btohqsg
Not so significant data point  Activesg Plus gym pass purchases MCC now code as Computer Software Store  not Government,btohqsg
"I not sure because I dun qualify for UOB Reserve Card. If we are talking about the same ML article  the article wrote ""......  only the UOB Reserve Cardâ€™s website has been updated with this information....""",btohqsg
Donâ€™t need to argue la.Uob excluding all amaze from 1st October 2024.,btohqsg
See laâ€¦ keep abuse only you all miles hackersâ€¦ ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Keeping positive is good but letâ€™s move on after 1st Oct ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Hey guys  I was told this is a good community for stock trading and tips. Is that true or was I misled?,btohqsg
You can put 100$ RSP into STI mutual fund as well. Not risk free  but not too high a risk as well,btohqsg
To be honest DBS interests have been stable and high during low interest rate periods. So I wouldnâ€™t count it out,btohqsg
#dp7 11 in Queenstown transaction on 29 today still not posted ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Yes uob lady on apple pay,btohqsg
Maybe i should tap my card next time.,btohqsg
Apply pay take 2-4 days to post. Paywave contactless then can post on same day.,btohqsg
Which e wallet solution eg grab pay earns the most rebate,btohqsg
Hi  have applied for UOB Nation of Savers Promo. Would just like to confirm if transfer via PAYNOW from a DBS account (not under my name) will be considered as fresh funds? Thanks!,btohqsg
As long you meet the conditions as stated in the t&c,btohqsg
Hi mau I check for gxsWhat is requirements to open including ageAnd do it has monthly service charge,btohqsg
Any insurancce agent from prudential can advise? I got a 3k premium to pay but my cardup got a $30 discount which is up to $1054. Can I pay $1054 using card up and the remaining using normal transaction thru prudential ipay?,btohqsg
You gotta ask ur agent directly.,btohqsg
I did but this is prudential backend. She not sure hence Iâ€™m asking if anybody did it before,btohqsg
"Not agent but cardup just asks for policy number and doesn't need ""invoice"" of the premium so you can pay whatever amount you want. As long as prudential in the end receives the premium amount I don't think it matters where they receive it from. After all what cardup does is just transferring money to their account with your policy no. as reference",btohqsg
Donâ€™t think can . Coz $30 likely go back to you and not prudential,btohqsg
$30 is the promo code for cardup ps not discount,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
So at the end of the day  they just receive the total sum right,btohqsg
I think as long as received   doesnâ€™t matter,btohqsg
I think so la.. as long as pru receives the total amount,btohqsg
Interestingly if u do a $150k fresh funds transfer from Dbs to Uob with both accounts having different names  Dbs and/or Uob may call up the account holder to ask questions.Not a big deal if u are able to handle their questions but be aware.,btohqsg
For this UOB nation of savers when was the year mark month ?,btohqsg
May I ask for HSBC EGA 2 accounts strategy  can I just transfer from account A to B? or need to transfer to other bank first?,btohqsg
Did the tnc mentioned on fresh fund and its defintion?,btohqsg
Yes  must be fresh fund  but A & B is different individual,btohqsg
AMAZE exclusion only apply for UOB reserved card?,btohqsg
