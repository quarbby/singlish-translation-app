Registrations have closed! Thank you everyone for your support! üòäWinners of the Exclusive Passes will be announced next week! Stay tuned! ‚ù§Ô∏è- E,btohqsg
Hopefully my luck will continue and I‚Äôll get it!!,btohqsg
Anyone know where‚Äôs a nice place to buy car wash and accessories stuff?,btohqsg
Or not  petrol station also have basics to start.,btohqsg
I just realised what it mean! Eh it is legit very good lehhhhhh. My boss go their certification course woah so impressed with their work one,btohqsg
Best price always at Taobao üòÑüòÑ,btohqsg
Their selection is huge though. Go take a walk through when have time bah,btohqsg
Hmm will give it a go! Any preference for which outlets to go?,btohqsg
Quite personal but I go the one at Bukit Batok reserve there before. Quite nice.,btohqsg
Noted! Maybe will head down there later since I‚Äôm going nearby there,btohqsg
Let us know how you find it!,btohqsg
Was thinking of doing my own car washing humble side hustle  like maybe wanna start off in my car park  friends and families  don‚Äôt know should I anot,btohqsg
I think some of the kors kors here have done before!!!,btohqsg
Need advices if any body have experience before!,btohqsg
Not easy. You be competing with pump station n bangala. Can you provide the same service at a lower price?,btohqsg
I would say start off with 10-15 per wash? Like a basic ones,btohqsg
When I get enough  for sure I will do a good car wash including tire wash  and abit of basic waxing that will start off around $30+,btohqsg
Got a lot of bangala doing,btohqsg
I saw the pail of water they were using. Pity the last car they washed.,btohqsg
I believe my service will be better than bangala,btohqsg
But my house carpark here don‚Äôt have any washer thou,btohqsg
"I believe they don't ""wash"". They merely wipe the cars with a pail of recycled plain water.",btohqsg
Which will leave them with a lots of water marks eventually  and damage the paints isn‚Äôt,btohqsg
Oh...no water source other than from your home? Tough leh bro...,btohqsg
Oh have is have  I mean like no workers to wash peopl car,btohqsg
Ah...I see....if no existing competition at your area  I guess u can try rather then regret not trying later. üòÅ,btohqsg
The only Heinz I know sells beans (beans means Heinz),btohqsg
They got ketchup also. I add that to my rice towards month ends.,btohqsg
Now petrol station charge $11 per wash. I suppose not many car owners willing to pay this amount for a wash. If you can do at a cheaper rate  then you might have a chance.,btohqsg
I already see $12 at some sir,btohqsg
I would assume it's not just the price,btohqsg
If@woshijordanjrcan offer a better quality wash with good equipment and do it within the confines of the carpark,btohqsg
I wouldn't be surprised if people would prefer it,btohqsg
As they don't have to drive to the petrol kiosk  don't have to worry about cloths used  don't even have to leave the house if they trust him to move the car within the carpark,btohqsg
The pricing depends on how much his equipment costs him and what his cost of consumables per wash is,btohqsg
And how much he values his time at,btohqsg
But there is always a market when a more convenient and quality offering is available,btohqsg
I only can do it like whenever o free to earn some extra cash! Because in the day  I will be in school,btohqsg
I will only be free like at night sometimes and weekends,btohqsg
But to gain people trust  I not sure whether will it be easy,btohqsg
Morning Aunty! Shiny lahhhhh. See how clean and shiny it looks? I love reflective stuff,btohqsg
Before I know it  I‚Äôll be in my 40s le. Time flies hor,btohqsg
Still long way to go dude,btohqsg
I have some scratches on the car  some dents  some minor scratch  next time will go to a professional and get it done!,btohqsg
