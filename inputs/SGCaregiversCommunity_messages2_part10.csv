Anyone know is there a special nail trimmer for such thickened nails ?And just trim it normally as usual nails ?,btohqsg
hmm not meant to be medical advice  but i just quickly googled about it and here's what i got:https://www.healthline.com/health/thick-toenails#takeaway,btohqsg
i am also wondering how others deal with ingrown toe nail because we face that problem too.... and every time i try to trim my loved one's nails  it's painful for her so i havent really managed to solve this issue yet,btohqsg
i saw some stickers thingy on shopee that claims to help with ingrown nails but i am quite skeptical lol,btohqsg
oh this article tells you step by step on how to trimhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/multimedia/nails/sls-20076741?s=3,btohqsg
It's better to approach a podiatrist  she is an expert in foot care. Podiatristshelp people in the care of their lower limbs including the foot and ankle and may also be involved in supporting older people to reduce their risk of falling.,btohqsg
Agree  ask podiatrist.  Go polyclinic doc and ask for referral to polyclinic podiatrist.Podiatrist taught me to use filer to file my mum's nails every 2 weeks then it's more manageable and prevent ingrown and told me how much of the white nail needs to be there to protect the toes. Ask podiatrist since it's different condition for each elderly,btohqsg

Hi all  sharing this survey on caregivers if it's of any interest :),btohqsg
(from Prof Jean Liu)We often cite the statistic: by 2030  1 in 4 Singaporeans will be aged over 65. This translates to a large number of caregivers  but how do we care for the carers?My student Rebecca is trying to address this question. Would you help us complete this survey (survey link:tinyurl.com/caregiver123)  and do you have access to a meet-the-people session or community group where we can distribute it?Rebecca started this project last year as part of our partnership with the Ministry of Health (for my Health Psychology module). She was so passionate about the topic  she ended up extending it into a year-long Honors thesis.If we had our way  we'd survey 1 000 carers* to gain policy-relevant insights. Please help us spread the word and make a difference!(*Reimbursement will be capped to the first 160 participants to meet the Honors budget.),btohqsg
