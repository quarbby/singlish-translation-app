Mosquitoes everyday...   I want see xmm  not this kinda xmm leh...😂,btohqsg
Maybe if you zoom in close enough  the mosquito actually looks like her,btohqsg
The mosquitoes here are pretty bad too but mainly summer,btohqsg
During summer the hordes of commandos are unleashed,btohqsg
I hang a mosquito repellent thingy on the main door. Burn a mosquito incense stick during the day right outside  windows closed or open with mosquito netting  once it's dark  each room will have a mosquito attracting trap that sucks them in just in case any got in. And my mosquito killer zapper racket if any appear.,btohqsg
Works pretty well most of the time. Main thing is not to let them enter home,btohqsg
I think I've killed maybe 50-80 mosquitoes over the years with the racket. And 10-20 flies. It's always worse if you are on ground floor and there's foilage around. But there's rarely dengue type sickness here. SG too much of the wrong breeding ground,btohqsg
The only way to avoid mosquito and 小强 is to stay high high floor,btohqsg
That is true but even had mosquito take lift before. But of course not as many la lol. As for roaches once they get in your home and breed is the problem. And they can come with boxes  up the lift etc but yeah high up helps overall with most insects,btohqsg
1-6th floors higher chance of ants too. I've had to poison bait them or throw off their scent.,btohqsg
In my first year here I had to deal with a stinkbug invasion too,btohqsg
Until I found the chink in window netting. Killed 30+ in the home,btohqsg
Anyone believe SIA can hit $10 again ?,btohqsg
Using racket to kill insects e sound is like electrocuted.. 阿弥陀佛🙏,btohqsg
I believe...but better sell sia buy sats,btohqsg
Lol the piak very loud and satisfying. Sorry no sympathy for mosquitoes even tho I'm an animal lover. And flies are pests too.,btohqsg
