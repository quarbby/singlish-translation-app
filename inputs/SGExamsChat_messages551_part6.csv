"Winsteini'm just gonna say a few things to u. Don't ever go to ite and ask the students there whether ite rabak or how rabak it is. I know us ite students are always looked down upon by other ppl cuz we r seemed as ""bad"" and don't know how to study. Thats not the case for everyone. Maybe there r some students like tht but is usually cuz of family situations. For most of us is because of unforseen circumstances we happened to be in ite. Not all ite students r bad rmbr tht. read the news see how many ite students do great things even many of them gg to uni. If u have friends or u know anyone tht been to ite ask them bout their experiences  ite is rly different. If u ever have friends tht end up in ite  support them don't look down on them. The public is alr looking down on us we don't need extra people looking down on us.",btohqsg
I tot u got beef w him or what Sia,btohqsg
But srsly tho are ite students like badly behaved?,btohqsg
