In addition  George Yeo got around $xxk as a ministerWhen he got voted out  he earn Millions in private,btohqsg
Yes as in fake? Or yes as in real news?,btohqsg
Thats only true for some Ministers. Was talking about TPL here.Also not accurate to say because AFTER they left government they earned more hence justifying their current salary.Simply because they gain value in their profile being a minister establishing social network amd standing among elites.Most ex SAF officers for example those that get parachuted in  its really difficult to justify say their knowledge in SAF into banking or transport,btohqsg
I want to know too  can someone reply to this?,btohqsg
TPL was earning alot before she entered politics.  She was working in MNC and in a high position.,btohqsg
