and that doesnt mean i cant go uni?,btohqsg
my parents are both bad at sciences,btohqsg
even if they do they aren't hereditary,btohqsg
there's a reason why that graduate mothers eugenics scheme didn't come to fruition,btohqsg
is just an excuse to say why u are bad at studyin,btohqsg
I'm sure u will do well in the end :),btohqsg
I regret so many stuff in sec sch,btohqsg
is just whether they want or not,btohqsg
and whether they study properly or not also,btohqsg
My way of studying probs rrly shit but oh well,btohqsg
every1 has a unique way of studyin ba,btohqsg
heard it's for pure students and other subj combi idk not v sure,btohqsg
Some people have circumstances beyond their control. Medical issues  family issues  all sorts of issues,btohqsg
yes  but in this case  no,btohqsg
I have econs that week but 1 week is still too much imo. They shd separate it out more,btohqsg
the vast majority don't experience such issues  be it fortunately  or unfortunately also,btohqsg
that being said  u all shld cherish ur sec sch teachers more,btohqsg
Some people have death in the immideate family  or undergo operation after operation. So you can't expect much. Not saying these people can't do well  it's just that the circumstances are out of their control,btohqsg
the higher u study  the shittier teacher becomes in general,btohqsg
im gonna give zero ratings to two teachers if im asked to give a review this year,btohqsg
Are ten times better than my primary school ones,btohqsg
My primary school Teachers can all burn in hell,btohqsg
They just don’t really love the students,btohqsg
yes felt like i was in a nursery prison,btohqsg
They cannnot be bothered to provide proper care and support to the students,btohqsg
Got bullied and they were like,btohqsg
Partly because the class size is so big,btohqsg
maybe until p5/p6 it got much better,btohqsg
i think p1 to p4 was the part that sucked the most,btohqsg
My primary school class was still 40,btohqsg
Because you are younger I guess,btohqsg
P5 was the worst for me,btohqsg
P6 I just secluded myself and played minecraft all day,btohqsg
But 40 is still a massive class size,btohqsg
My JC class is not even 30,btohqsg
But my secondary school teachers can care for such a class,btohqsg
That’s why I think they suck,btohqsg
Maybe because you are more mature so they respect you more,btohqsg
The primary school Teachers didn’t give us any respect,btohqsg
I find a lot of primary school teachers have little to no respect for students,btohqsg
and thats why sec sch is better,btohqsg
teachers think sec sch students are more mature,btohqsg
I still remember once I forgot to bring my calculator for an exam,btohqsg
Just because ur younger doesn't mean u dont deserve care,btohqsg
in general ah  ofc got exceptions,btohqsg
Then she just said ‘too bad’,btohqsg
I wanted to punch her so badly,btohqsg
I was already like 1.65 by then in P6,btohqsg
Not suprised. I have seen teachers scolding the student for asking if they could borrow something they forgot for an exam. Adding oil to the fire,btohqsg
Will just bounce of the fat,btohqsg
