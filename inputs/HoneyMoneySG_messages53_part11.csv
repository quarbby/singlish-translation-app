Don't think have any other way to cash out. Spend or absorb the transfer fee to grab before withdraw,btohqsg
Idea in TnC is basically this - if you pair to amaze and use for public transport (both conditions hit)  you won't earn anything,btohqsg
Use it to pay those transactions that do not earn rewards n in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
yeah i might just suck it up and pay the 2% fee to cash out with grab.logic being i will gain more using miles/cashback cards instead of forcefully using the Amaze wallet and only earn 1% cashback.mousehunter idea is also decent if I have transactions in exclusion list and yet accept card (so far can't really think of any common ones).,btohqsg

Hi all  just applied UOB EVOL card  wanted to check like my gym membership that is charge to the card does it consider online or others? also u see if u go to shopee website to shop is consider online but what if u use the shopee app does it consider online too? if shopee app is consider online  what if i use fairprice app which can tie to the card and use the app to make payment at kopitiam foodcourt or fairprice supermart would it consider online too? thanks in advance.,btohqsg
I just unbundled the EVOL card from FairPrice APP. Sometimes the salesperson may make the mistake of paying by APP.,btohqsg
The salesperson may think it doesn't matter. While we can get 8% from mobile contactless of $250 and 8% from online transactions of $250.,btohqsg
payment by app for fairprice was reported a few times to be deemed as physical payments too,btohqsg
mean first day of the month to the last day of the month right??,btohqsg
there's an issue on fairprice side where in-app would result as offline  someone posted a reply from CSO confirming that and they are fixing it (not sure if its already fixed)^i may have gotten some details wrong but thats the gist of it,btohqsg
