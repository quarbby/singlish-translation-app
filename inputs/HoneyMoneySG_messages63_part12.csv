Probably didn‚Äôt capture the tap at the exit. Try to ask for a help from passenger services.Used to happen to my kid‚Äôs concessions card. Fine for the bus  but won‚Äôt work for MRT if you didn‚Äôt tap at the exit.,btohqsg
Anybody received HSBC sure win spin in August?,btohqsg
Are you using the same phone or you switch between phone and the card?,btohqsg
No issue for me using physical card or gpay. Try physical card instead?If u use CC  the detection is a bit slow. No issue for bus as everyone move slower  but mrt everyone seems to be running fast so it may not have time to detect your card. Wait a bit after the front person tap  then u tap and hold for 2-3sec,btohqsg
Yea makes sense. Thanks!! Shall take note next time,btohqsg

1. you need to sign up with citibank thru the singsaver application link before the deadline  then complete the singsaver rewards form within 2 weeks of the email2. this depends on citibank. got mine within a week3. not applicable for citibank  since you get a virtual card to use as soon as your application is approved.note that you'll want to also get an Amaze card to make the best use of CRMC.,btohqsg
