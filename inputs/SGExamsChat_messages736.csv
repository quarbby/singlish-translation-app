Alot of schs got all their meme as hell topic orders,btohqsg
I heard CJ H2 econs go straight to macro and skip market structure,btohqsg
i gave up on phys department,btohqsg
At least in tm the lectures are good,btohqsg
the h1 and h2 notes are the same,btohqsg
No like the cher go through the stuff,btohqsg
I think iz coz there is only 61 ppl,btohqsg
I think h1 math also hv lect iirc,btohqsg
Reminds me of how my jc h1 econs no lecture one,btohqsg
But more ppl take h1 than h2 lol,btohqsg
Seeing the content diff  aiya just take h2,btohqsg
They don't have essay sure but,btohqsg
Essay low-key free marks if U study,btohqsg
My econs cher told me i would score better for h1 lol,btohqsg
Idw to do 80 mark case study,btohqsg
ya 2x 40 marks case study,btohqsg
No there is a format the markers wanna see,btohqsg
Ya 2*40 seems painful as hell,btohqsg
1 for para 1 against para,btohqsg
but wtv i alr took econs in y2 alr so i dont rlly care so much alr,btohqsg
taking h2 kinda allow me to appreciate the subj more,btohqsg
I read this properly but ur symptoms sound more than pre-period,btohqsg
"Now is my ""most favourite subject""",btohqsg
oh ya yall 3 ple passage papers hahahah,btohqsg
I forgot what is aq please enlighten me,btohqsg
Where you need to argue based on the passage and then talk about sg characteristics and examples,btohqsg
also limited to 8 qn for paper 1,btohqsg
but only gd thing is less content,btohqsg
I still taking the old syllabus,btohqsg
The good thing is the first few qns usually can smoke fr the case study and then things are bite size split,btohqsg
yeah first 2-3 qn 1-4 marks,btohqsg
after that no chance at all,btohqsg
Ive always been feeling bad but i think the pre period just made it way worse,btohqsg
I can understand  some ppl do get pre-period symptoms‚Ä¶hope you will feel better after thisüôèüôè,btohqsg
I'm p sure every sch does vectors in j1,btohqsg
I think i know who rand is  he is the r guy,btohqsg
You r my jiejie now ü´∂üèª ü§ó,btohqsg
I stupid i tot it was him coz rand is in his id lol,btohqsg
That's larger than ej h2+h1 geog cohort combined,btohqsg
Omg i feel so old now,btohqsg
Maybe I shud change my name,btohqsg
Most ppl take h2 h1 econs ah,btohqsg
I think tm‚Äôs econs cohort is very very mega,btohqsg
Most arts stream peeps take lit,btohqsg
But i really admire lit people,btohqsg
wait but translate to what language,btohqsg
H2 Translation is a subject by itself,btohqsg
Ik someone in EJ doing translation,btohqsg
Literally 90% of arts students take lit,btohqsg
English to Chinese and Chinese to English,btohqsg
I remembered my friend taking some chinese studies thing?,btohqsg
I wud have taken it but I used to like chem more,btohqsg
Also un recognised Israel palestine as a genocide today,btohqsg
But not the 1st half coz i no translation,btohqsg
I cant even read chinese anymoreüò¢,btohqsg
Oh wow I only heard about the UNSC ceasefire vote but not thisFrom an online articleA UN human rights expert will deliver a report on Tuesday saying thatIsraelhas carried out acts of genocide in Gaza and should be placed under an arms embargo.Francesca Albanese the UN special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories said in her report there were ‚Äúreasonable grounds‚Äù to believe that Israel was carrying out three of the five acts defined as genocide: killing Palestinians  causing them serious bodily or mental harm  and ‚Äúdeliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction‚Äù of the population in whole or in part.,btohqsg
Yeah it's factually a genocide tbf,btohqsg
"By all objective standards of what a ""genocide"" is",btohqsg
Yeah even if Israel was not the aggressor,btohqsg
But im on my period so,btohqsg
Rand what did you wanna post,btohqsg
Eh but legit why I‚Äôm curious to know your views,btohqsg
We can have a civil discussion without Josh,btohqsg
My opinion isJust like all other conflicts happening over the same fucking reasonAll of this is stupid,btohqsg
It's just a waste of like everything,btohqsg
I feel like our generation will be part of ww3,btohqsg
But it is a genocide cuz there is proven intent to harm a minority group protected under the convention based on the 5 criterion of destruction,btohqsg
Too much instability around the world,btohqsg
"U unironically can't rly dispute thatMaybe you can like say that there is no ""deliberate targeting"" but thats abt it",btohqsg
"Rn the only reason why its disputed as a ""genocide"" is cause you cant actually prove that israel is choosing to deliberately hunt down palestinians LOL",btohqsg
china plans to invade taiwan by 2047,btohqsg
And China keeps saying that they wanna invade Taiwan cuz US is putting their forces in Japan and Australia to protect taiwanSo now we just playing brinkmanship and security dilemma until someone CRACKS,btohqsg
Oh so it‚Äôs just the only technicality that could prevent it from being officially classified as one,btohqsg
in all genocides the hardest thing to prove is intent,btohqsg
Might have a change of plan since Xi won‚Äôt last forever I guess  perhaps the next leader won‚Äôt be as nationalist,btohqsg
Im basing it off what Xi said,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt get enough of it in my office since I‚Äôm a light sleeper,btohqsg
Meh just get it done and over with. But I suppose now that the pw syllabus is watered down the curriculum time allocated has been reduced?,btohqsg
I stand by the fact that PW can be finshed in a week,btohqsg
"1) Hamas hides bombs under a pile of vegetables in baskets  then they try to get children to carry from one place to another; into people's houses  then kena bombed  and thhey do hide bombs in the UN facilities as well2) do you ever wonder why they wear civilian clothes to fight  and not let the ppl leave the country? It is to accuse israel of genocide  so this is essentially the human shields  if they care about the palestinians so much won't they bring the palestinians hide inside the tunnels?3) they prioritise the tunnel ventilations  not the hospitals4) Majority of the aid goes to hamas  not the civilians5) the education system in palestine is so rigged  always training children to hate the israelis  and getting the guys to be maytyred to commit jihad6) The funds thhat hamas gets is called ""financial jihad""7) From 1948 all the way israel is being attacked from the arab israeli war to yom kippur to 1st and 2nd intafada  why no protest at that time  why only now on 7 october?I know i am gonna get hated for this but these are my views",btohqsg
but i am gonna keep it like that for now,btohqsg
I wish I was born a bit later,btohqsg
Nah the last one you‚Äôre fine so long as Josh isn‚Äôt here. But from my POV ah  I was just looking up the definition of what a genocide was,btohqsg
Just cause its a genocide doesnt mean its wrong,btohqsg
:/ idk why people keep assigning value judgements on things which dont actually need value judements,btohqsg
"objective standpoint technically if we go by international borders standards  whatever is happening you can kinda argue that palestine isnt fighting for the wrong cause. Their methods of fighting are just fucked upPeople just choose to associate the ""death and killing"" as like a way of passing blame to someone? Which tbf is kind of a stupid thing but understandable in most contexts (because we all grow up with the mindset that so long as you display physical violence you will always be in the wrong)",btohqsg
which is kinda dumb la the notion,btohqsg
"what makes things worse is that people refuse to acknowledge this as an overall humanitarian crisis as a result tbf because theyre like""ohh technically hamas caused everything therefore its not a humanitarian crisis cause they deserve it""Which is like okay but we can separate the state powers from the people from the morality of the issue? but idk why no one does that lol",btohqsg
I feel like I need to talk to the school counsellor but Idk,btohqsg
I dont know what to say,btohqsg
Should I write down what I feel on a paper and give her?,btohqsg
eh but rlly thank you for giving me the space for this type of contentious discussion,btohqsg
ive been getting sick way more often than usual,btohqsg
you can always take gap years,btohqsg
Yeah tbh it‚Äôs hard to draw a fine line between what is right and wrong. If someone does something as an act of retaliation  how do we tell whether that act is justified in the name of self defence or it went overboard?A former US VP who visited Palestine after the partition plan in 1947 said ‚ÄúI saw evidence on the village level that the Jew and the Arab get along very well  provided hatred and discord are not incited from the outside.‚ÄùPerhaps the reason why polls show that even more Palestinians support the October 7 events right now compared to at the start of the war  is because Hamas managed to frame the war as a struggle against imperialists instead of an idealistic one  and by doing so they managed to capture the hearts and minds of civilians. So instead of the mounting civilian death toll decreasing support for the war  Hamas used it as a rallying call against Israel and to strengthen their resolve in fighting against them. Palestinians could‚Äôve just bought into that narrative  even if Hamas does not necessarily have their best interests at heart.Sometimes it‚Äôs the state that‚Äôs the problem  not the hoi polloi.But also I don‚Äôt know a lot about this topic  and my views may be flawed. I‚Äôm just putting it the way I see it.,btohqsg
No I mean my PW is alr done and dusted  there‚Äôs no point now,btohqsg
I'm generally of the opinion that all opinions are good so long as you can justify it (which you did)Even if I disagree it doesn't mean ur opinion is wrong (unless ur back it up badly then uh idk lol),btohqsg
Fundamentally tbf this is just cuz I taught gp for like a year + and this is technically what gp is supposed to teach,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I said you should see a doctor. It‚Äôs been going on for so long  you likely need to go for further tests and get a diagnosis. Avoid delaying the visit for too long,btohqsg
You can just walk into a polyclinic and say you want to see a doctor for a chronic condition at registration,btohqsg
Or if not maybe your GP can help refer you for further tests,btohqsg
Unfortunately not free for non NSFs lol,btohqsg
Idk if it's actl a real like,btohqsg
then rn its that time of the month so my entire body hurts,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why you need further tests to find out. Either way you need help anyway  so just go and see a doc,btohqsg
You‚Äôd never know if there‚Äôs some serious underlying health condition that‚Äôs yet to be diagnosed,btohqsg
Did you like quit then rejoin,btohqsg
Wah vj people be pissing me the fuck off in camp,btohqsg
34 was recorded 2 days ago  2 degrees shy of becoming hottest record in sg history,btohqsg
my stomach hurts so badly but I don't have panadol,btohqsg
They just act hyper privileged la,btohqsg
I legit feel like fainting rn,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt rly think of vj as a rich sch,btohqsg
Should I just sleep until 1220,btohqsg
I don't think they are a rich sch,btohqsg
Like the first sch that would come to mind is maybe ACSi,btohqsg
I'm trying to do bio but I feel sleepy,btohqsg
But maybe they like to project that image?,btohqsg
Bruh my eyes literally feel like dropping,btohqsg
idk it's 2x1h lessons per week,btohqsg
I think that‚Äôs a bit less than what I got but not by much,btohqsg
They should just make it 1h per week with the new syllabus,btohqsg
"""oh we must make sure everyone must pass!"" type ahh schedule",btohqsg
should I use my bt21 notebook or another a4 notebook for the section on molecular genetics,btohqsg
I was at pasir ris a few weeks back,btohqsg
Not being able to do what u enjoy is another sign of psychological symptomsüò¢,btohqsg
Actually i was having a crazy time understanding genetics,btohqsg
Took 6h to rewatch my 2h lecture,btohqsg
Use the bt21 book on the thing u love,btohqsg
My dad got me what i really needed,btohqsg
Tbf this one that happened today,btohqsg
Is a particularly rich vj student,btohqsg
Just dont acknowledge they are rich,btohqsg
He asked me what i want to eat,btohqsg
This showed how sleepy i really was,btohqsg
One of them told me and my friend that his dad only made 10k a month,btohqsg
And he thinks he's lower SES,btohqsg
Cuz my friend was saying how he had to reject cambeisge cuz of how ex it was,btohqsg
The when he gave the sch fee/year or smth,btohqsg
"My vj friend ""okay what that's only 2 times of my Dad's monthly salary""",btohqsg
Then he kept trying to claim he was low SES,btohqsg
I did a 8 day trip thr,btohqsg
I think korea is cheaper than most people think tho,btohqsg
Idk I did the usual standard touristy stuff lol,btohqsg
I dont listen to a PTE,btohqsg
Look at the big bucks on Kuro atas siol took cab,btohqsg
i'll prob use a bigger one from the bigger topic and use the bt21 for like evolution or smth,btohqsg
i have a few a4 notebooks,btohqsg
hav u seen ur counsellor yet,btohqsg
cause i dont print notes for bio,btohqsg
If my grandmother had wheels she'd be a bike.,btohqsg
i make my own from the softcopy notes,btohqsg
and all my notes are in this a4 book,btohqsg
Good what keep bedok in SAF forever,btohqsg
I prefer such coz it will sort of mean lesser pages,btohqsg
Oops i realized advertisement cant be done hereüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
"""Sergeant Bedok I got headache*Bedok: Weak Noob",btohqsg
I can imagine him as an warrant officer,btohqsg
i should take pics of my bio a4 notebook ltr,btohqsg
He got the insults and mannerism down liao so that's good,btohqsg
Eh fuck you. Sign extra now,btohqsg
"Tbh the main reason is because I had it lying around and it had ""biology"" written on it so i just used what i have",btohqsg
I have A5 notebooks for other stuff also,btohqsg
Actually my lect notes is my notebook,btohqsg
U SEE THAT TREE  FUCK THAT TREE NOW!But Sergeant Maj I am Gay..Bedok: FUCK YOU CK IDIOT,btohqsg
Same cause im too untidy to write notes from scratch,btohqsg
Recruit: points middle finger at the tree,btohqsg
Actually relatable  in primary school i always hv stomach ache and nausea  there was once in p5 i vomited on my table‚Ä¶then the principal said ‚Äòthis (GO) is not a playground‚Äô,btohqsg
We imagining Bedok as a Warrant Occiper,btohqsg
For me  it is coz i will find myself rewriting my lecture notes which defeats the purpose,btohqsg
GRENADE!!! *Throws the Pin instead of the Grenade*,btohqsg
i can squeeze 20 pgs of stuff into 10,btohqsg
If the doctor say i cannot throw grenade then how ah,btohqsg
I dun hv the skill of removing fluffüò¢,btohqsg
but anyway i can take pics of my bio notes ltr,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt believe everything doctor says  doctor not sergeant,btohqsg
I went for my ns checkup and the sgt said this,btohqsg
Recruit: Coughs out BloodBedok: Fucking CKW U sign extra for even asking me,btohqsg
Imagine when recruits have their rifle and they commit shooting at the most unexpected time,btohqsg
ya doctor only know how to make profit,btohqsg
Does anyone have any panadol substitutes that can easily obtained from a school canteen,btohqsg
Panadol cant do anything to my body already sia,btohqsg
Bro im in a school canteen,btohqsg
It cant even wine down my feverüíÄ,btohqsg
Now is my entire body pain,btohqsg
I dont even feel like eating i feel like collapsing,btohqsg
Im not sure if GO MAY have medications,btohqsg
Im not really sick though js feeling like im gonna die,btohqsg
Ok for 1 my stomach hurts real bad and 2nd i keep wanting to fall asleep while walking,btohqsg
Temporary will give you a boost in energy,btohqsg
Maybe its because i havent eaten any real food since yesterday,btohqsg
Ur stomach hurts could be cramps or gastric,btohqsg
Is there any pharmacies near dhs,btohqsg
Also should I buy a cold drink to combat the pain,btohqsg
And when dies ur break end,btohqsg
Ngl i feel like buying iced tea to fight fire with fire,btohqsg
U can try seeing if ur friends / go happen to hv meds,btohqsg
I dont think my friends would have meds,btohqsg
Wait let my try to list my symptoms,btohqsg
She is falling asleep while walking  pain I don't think is going to be a concern. Pain won't matter if you just faint,btohqsg
Fainting is the last thing she wants I think,btohqsg
Other than falling asleep while walking  do u hv chest pain / chest discomfort / shortness of breath etc,btohqsg
Why cant Africa be more interesting,btohqsg
For the cramp part  u can try sipping hot milo,btohqsg
For the part on falling asleep while walking  it sounds really scary,btohqsg
Every war in Africa is the same,btohqsg
Cold drink does not combat the pain  esp if it could be due to ur period. Hot drink would be better,btohqsg
Do u feel like falling down if u move,btohqsg
The waking up part  maybe coffee will help,btohqsg
But actually it does sound scary‚Ä¶maybe you should see a doctor instead of pulling through day by day like this,btohqsg
During O Level   I wrote own notes for English  Math  Chem  Bio  POA  Geog and SS,btohqsg
Is it something that happened recently or like since jnr high,btohqsg
Yea ill go buy iced coffee,btohqsg
since jh but it got worse,btohqsg
I think maybe next time u should keep meds with u,btohqsg
Though u should not be taking them on a daily basis (if u require meds on a daily basis  it is time to make a visit to the doctor),btohqsg
Counting down for u 3.5h left,btohqsg
I hope it is bio after the break so at least sth u like,btohqsg
My dad got me a very bitter coffee  it taste like siew siew daiüò¢,btohqsg
Hi gude  practicing  my skills exam is tmr lol,btohqsg
If you are below 19 it is contraindicated because of the risks of Reye Syndrome,btohqsg
tell me more about reye syndrome,btohqsg
Schr√∂r  K. Aspirin and Reye Syndrome. Pediatr-Drugs 9  195‚Äì204 (2007).https://doi.org/10.2165/00148581-200709030-00008,btohqsg
It's induced brain injury and damage usually due to liver toxicity. We don't really fully know why Asprin does it in a pharmacology perspective but it does and since we have other any pyretic agents It's just better to not use Asprin for that.,btohqsg
any poly people doing pt jobs while waiting for poly or enlistment,btohqsg
ngl i feel like i really need to see a doctor its legit damn bad,btohqsg
i'm way too different from my classmatesbasically the titlei realised i don't rly fit in properly with the rest of the class  because our interests are so damn different. yea sure there are some overlaps  but even these are minimal. the girls? they like arts  going out tgt and taking photos  studying tgt  doing tiktok dances. the guys? typical sg guy starter pack: clash royale  brawl stars  football  basketball  pokemon  animeand theres me: minecraft  genshin  roblox (specific games)  table tennis  ice skating  horror games and shows  watching ppl rig 2d models. there are some guys in my class that play table tennis too  but i cant muster up the courage to go up to them and ask them if i can play tgt with them bc the 13 of them guys always stay tgt and its weird afso how? any advice? i'm feeling rly out of place rn(btw im a girl bc i forgot to mention previously),btohqsg
I sound so cheebai now üíÄ,btohqsg
I can't tell if it's srs,btohqsg
They not like me making crochet their entire ass personality trait,btohqsg
i js realised is a copypasta,btohqsg
My stomach pains are back ü§°ü§°,btohqsg
idts  he usually get kopi beng siew dai,btohqsg
Yes u should  like how im finally gonna see one,btohqsg
But be prepared to wait 2h even w an appointment,btohqsg
Just mobile register and get a 10am slot then sleep until healthbuddy says 3 ppl left,btohqsg
Sounds abt right but that is only for singhealth polyclinic,btohqsg
Did u get ur tele acct back,btohqsg
Non-Singhealth NUHS still can I think,btohqsg
And also i dk if i can actually survive 2w before i see my psychologist coz i hv been breaking down every single day,btohqsg
Is just the shitty NHG ones,btohqsg
Health hub maybe work too not too familiar w health hub,btohqsg
Bitch ik that healthhub can still do for NUHS and Singhealth,btohqsg
I tot ur tele got hacked,btohqsg
But this only works if u live near the polyclinic,btohqsg
U mean non big 3 non priv?,btohqsg
That does not seem like a proven fact,btohqsg
If i could give an example,btohqsg
Where else other than SIT have other allied health courses that SIT offer,btohqsg
If its a mature estate there's like a 90% chance u live near a polyclinic,btohqsg
Cuz as long as u have a high population of old fuckers,btohqsg
That is not an appropriate way to call the older gen,btohqsg
Not that i dw to answer but i dunno how to answer this,btohqsg
@phxrqbrother bring back your cock junior college jokes thanks,btohqsg
I think he thinks that way is due to igp,btohqsg
A) who the fuck says that?B) Age.,btohqsg
Does not mean that going there means failure,btohqsg
Lol i didnt get in classcomm but idc,btohqsg
Anyway my stomach doesnt hurt FOR NOW AMA,btohqsg
lemme guess isit cuz the popz students all got in?,btohqsg
No like i feel he thinks that way is coz if u compare say a course that is available at suss / sutd vs the same course avail at NUS/NTU/SMU  the igp to enter is lower so maybe that is why he will that way,btohqsg
the door girl got chair lol,btohqsg
ngl the vice chair is cute i voted for her,btohqsg
The one that slam the door,btohqsg
It is a consequence of this leading to a reason for that common thought,btohqsg
It is just a vicious cycle,btohqsg
got 1 position only 1 person run,btohqsg
there's perception reasons and there's opportunity reasons,btohqsg
And then there's just comprehensive reasons,btohqsg
NUS NTU are comprehensive unis that have almost everything in majors,btohqsg
Before an exam tmr our other exam result gonna release,btohqsg
SUTD and SIT are highly specialised even compared to SMU,btohqsg
Ok but SIT should not be part of the picture,btohqsg
Think nus ntu the most general,btohqsg
The courses in SIT is specialized and not available else where in other local uni,btohqsg
Which I mean is the reason why except for NUS NTU rankings all of em are behind,btohqsg
ok not sure about SIT  but SUTD is even more so compared to SMU,btohqsg
And it is a partnership with trinity college london,btohqsg
SUTD has an advantage in global rankings due to them being STEM centric,btohqsg
SUTD too tho. their curriculum is specific to them only,btohqsg
Exactly but in all other than NUS NTU it's mostly also cuz specialised unis are penalised,btohqsg
and their initial setup was from MIT,btohqsg
But look‚Ä¶if there is no SIT  our physio  ot  dietician and all that blah blah is come fr overseas,btohqsg
It is giving ppl who wanna pursue these a chance to do so locally,btohqsg
But actually why classcomm election is so late,btohqsg
And ngl this ip girl i think she gave a fire talk she didnt get,btohqsg
Cause we only got our classes in late feb,btohqsg
For SIT is even worse cuz of their structure,btohqsg
The day i got my class i SNAPS,btohqsg
I actually nearly went to sit,btohqsg
So to say its their course and uni is always iffy and does not record fully in the Uni ranking stats,btohqsg
To me SIT is q good lah,btohqsg
But just that it is new,btohqsg
This is not even a critique I am just saying their ranking is like that cuz of it,btohqsg
end of the day i think biggest thing is really just the perception,btohqsg
not just by the pre-uni kids but also employers,btohqsg
"Interviewer: "" So  what do u think are ur chances of winning?""The boy: "" Oh a guaranteed 100%  cuz i'm the only person running.""",btohqsg
There is this thing as a vote of confidence,btohqsg
door girl is jae??? and she has beef with u when she js joined last then 5 months ago? imagine having beef with someone that has been there longer then u? (referring to door girl),btohqsg
Like if u are the only one  there is a predetermined x% of votes u need get before getting voted in,btohqsg
Like a predetermined x% of voters need to say yes,btohqsg
Yeah there are mechanisms just how basically,btohqsg
Yeah Georgia has the Run off system so u need more than 50%,btohqsg
If not the top 2 candidates go into a runoff,btohqsg
Oh what i meant was when there is just 1 person running,btohqsg
Usually there is a vote of confidence system,btohqsg
Not rlly its most of the time just a walkover,btohqsg
Sometimes i do that subconsciously when i use too much force,btohqsg
Then if u wanna do a vote of no confidence u have to do another referendum,btohqsg
No the girl dl me i think,btohqsg
Cause last time i didn close the door very well OR the wind blew a bit then she pissed alr,btohqsg
I didnt know door can be a war,btohqsg
How much time do I give leeway,btohqsg
no cause its not like the boy (our lore can be made into an entire kdrama) she literally knew me for less than a MONTH,btohqsg
Before I legit start name and shame,btohqsg
Like they never pay for the notes?,btohqsg
ok cuz Cher alrd tell abt payment last week,btohqsg
I alrd help pay for the class,btohqsg
I ss the names of who owe me and put it in class chat,btohqsg
I keep doing it day by day until they pay,btohqsg
But ok cuz I kinda have beef W some of them,btohqsg
This is the problem i faced also,btohqsg
But I'm damn ticked la cuz,btohqsg
One of them is a fucking subject rep,btohqsg
Coz there are a few people in my class that got problem w me,btohqsg
If don't go and repo their stuff,btohqsg
U of all ppl shld know one,btohqsg
But i want my $$ so i did not care,btohqsg
Then dun pay for her subj notes,btohqsg
Plus I trust they usu pay me back,btohqsg
Cuz this is rarely a problem,btohqsg
take her subject notes and rip it infront off her,btohqsg
Bruh that will unnecessarily stir shit,btohqsg
"""u dont pay u dont get""",btohqsg
I'll just wait till next week,btohqsg
How much in total they owe u,btohqsg
I'm gonna start name and shame in class hc,btohqsg
Are the 4 ppl those u hv beef w,btohqsg
Ok I'm being prolly petty asf,btohqsg
u shld add on late payment charge,btohqsg
Even if I can't vibe w the subject rep,btohqsg
10¬¢ for everyday they didn't pay,btohqsg
Ok make sense  for me is math w the binding so it is ex,btohqsg
Classmates own him for 2 weeks,btohqsg
I legit shld start the interest threat alrd,btohqsg
"Maybe if he dw pay i should write""boy name"" ifyou can lie to me for 2 years you can pay $1.10 for notes also ü§óü§ó",btohqsg
Did u try talking to ur cher,btohqsg
I don't want to stir shit,btohqsg
It's just gonna stir more shit,btohqsg
I cant really remember if got ppl never pay me but i know i need to keep chasing in class chat and it was tiring,btohqsg
I can put aside how I feel,btohqsg
To pay for the fucking notes,btohqsg
I remembered the subject reps in my class keep spamming class chat w payment calls,btohqsg
U shld do the same for me,btohqsg
Play with his feelings or what not,btohqsg
Yes but some ppl dun hv,btohqsg
Idc U SC or what fucj,btohqsg
What i feel is that sometimes u can be nice but doesnt mean others will treat u the same way,btohqsg
I send the msg LAST TUESDAY,btohqsg
Just like how got this dude in my class who snatched away my notes just to get me to write teachers day card at this very instant,btohqsg
I did not even do anything,btohqsg
She was just pissed by my results and mugging,btohqsg
U should hv sought help when it happened and not let ur mental health go down the drain fr then till now,btohqsg
Coz i have experienced delaying for 3mths and it already drove me crazy,btohqsg
Coz my relative got to know about it and convinced me to go speak to someone,btohqsg
Basically i posted a sts saying i wanted to give away my items which was implying that i was s/icidal and then my friend told her ft who alerted the sch board cause i alr have a history of sh and other stuff,btohqsg
I really hope u are fine right now,btohqsg
Like i feel that u should go for counselling,btohqsg
Trying to survive and tide through ur symptoms day by day sounds scary,btohqsg
Wait musician did you see my mirror selfies,btohqsg
matcha you need a listening ear?,btohqsg
I feel@kohsyanis right that the mentally ill attract each other,btohqsg
is that a new physics thing,btohqsg
reminds me of push and pull mechanism,btohqsg
bc mentally unwell people tend to relate better and end up trauma bonding,btohqsg
which is toxic af but it happens,btohqsg
oh no üò≠üò≠üò≠ i ºm so sorry,btohqsg
i used a pen knife to slice my palms before  as a form of self harm,btohqsg
because that was the only thing i had  and my parents kept the kitchen knives hidden soo,btohqsg
do the people around you ever question,btohqsg
but in sh classrooms got aircon so they wont comment as much,btohqsg
Do what makes U comfortable la yeah,btohqsg
all the classrooms in my school has aircons too,btohqsg
LOL one of the reasons why i wanted dhs was cause aircon classroom but jh dont have üò¨,btohqsg
oh lots of jcs have aircons for all classrooms,btohqsg
like vjc and ejc for example,btohqsg
If anyth non aircon seems almost weird,btohqsg
is the weather tryna kill us?,btohqsg
when i went upper sec i tot i'll get aircon end up MY FKING CLASS DIDN'T GET AIRCON  WHEN ALL THE OTHER SEC 3 CLASS GOT,btohqsg
bro I gonna need to manifest all my self control on fri,btohqsg
the class itself didn't have aircon,btohqsg
we got more fans BUT THAT DOESN'T REPLACE AIRCON,btohqsg
most of the classes in my secondary school had no aircon at all,btohqsg
i heard an aircon has the same coldness as 50+ fans or something,btohqsg
not sure if that still holds truth,btohqsg
i dont really recall it anymore,btohqsg

Bro I'm so tempted tmr after geog tutorial announce REMEMBER TO PAY ME BACK FOR NOTES,btohqsg
if the room is alr warm it doesn't do crap,btohqsg
keep hating you obsessed lil loser and watch you retain j1 because you spent ALL your precious time on judging others rather than study for 2 years worth of half of uni level content!!!,btohqsg
bro imagine she retain until she spend the same number of year in dhs as me,btohqsg
because she said they are stirring up drama,btohqsg
then they will get so bad for a levels that they have to retake,btohqsg
Ngl i want to be jh again,btohqsg
