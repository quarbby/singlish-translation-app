text,group
So as a result everyone in poly received the email 😅😅😅,btohqsg
Did everyone in poly murder him?,btohqsg
And think got disciplinary action for misusing school email system,btohqsg
There is this one guy in my class who replied to the email saying he is playing fortnite game and how annoying the email is resulting in him having trouble focusing the game 😂😂,btohqsg
If anyone used office 365 for enterprise before knows that there is a feature called distribution group,btohqsg
This feature after that incident also later received unwanted email from adult only website  resulting in ppl receiving instructions on how to activate account on the site 😅😅,btohqsg
I assume some dude misuse it too,btohqsg
Without considering the fact that poly has students who are still below age of 18 😱🙄😕,btohqsg
it’s such a welcoming change of taste after using luckin for all my coffee cravings,btohqsg
anyone knows when NTU convo dates will be released?,btohqsg
like it'd at earliest be after the sem ends,btohqsg
but convo will defo be done by like first week aug right,btohqsg
do you need the specific day?,btohqsg
wld be great tbh... but week is good too,btohqsg
isit like last week of jul/first week of aug,btohqsg
nbs traditionally is the last day(s),btohqsg
that's the thing i checked like 2023 and 2022,btohqsg
i'll just push it all to after convo,btohqsg
Our convo is the same day meh,btohqsg
isok i'll come back for hho,btohqsg
Phd masters and bachelors grad tgt,btohqsg
i've said multiple times that the phd students ceremony is with the undergrads,btohqsg
Unless u are like nbs uh,btohqsg
u mean that useless wooden school,btohqsg
If only they had nicer south spine food tho,btohqsg
i still hate NTU for letting subway go,btohqsg
Luckin coffee doesnt even allow cash,btohqsg
They need to stop asking ppl to download apps,btohqsg
at least SS has CB now,btohqsg
i shall buy that tmr i think,btohqsg
They rlly need to have a wider variety of food,btohqsg
Real OGs remember long john silver...,btohqsg
There is not even an ounce of malay food,btohqsg
Why did it have to go...,btohqsg
The bigger qn is why ss yong tau foo stall had to go,btohqsg
And also their pasta stall 😭,btohqsg
If they touch my duck rice stall,btohqsg
real OGs rmb old chang kee,btohqsg
I aint even seen one person eat the ss ytf,btohqsg
Shit im not an og i aint even seen ock,btohqsg
Then like a few days later it closed,btohqsg
Like tbh i rather close down the mala stall,btohqsg
Plus is like need to share.What makes you think NTU is a place to socialise???,btohqsg
A hot hideout? I see alot of their marketing,btohqsg
SG60: Opportunities  Challenges and Aspirations🔈Calling all university studentsGrab this opportunity to participate in this dialogue with Mr Chan Chun Sing  Minister for Education.Happening on 3rd April 2025 at Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) — Sign up now!,btohqsg
just go through youtube video  faster.,btohqsg
Nope.But agreed that hot hideout is fkin good,btohqsg
Then they shld just eat yong tau foo 😭😭😭,btohqsg
I feel like thats fat shaming me,btohqsg
Oh hell nah their laksa is,btohqsg
you cant even call that laksa,btohqsg
you can call that chilli soup,btohqsg
So when is lestin gonna open a stall,btohqsg
jokes on you i m a direct descendant of a chicken rice store,btohqsg
Well it is still better than that minaturised gyoza bento,btohqsg
if i cant find a job i will take over the chicken rice empire,btohqsg
ye  it was a major prob..over the course of a week..a bunch of these were emailed to everyone,btohqsg
SAY IES TO IESTIN'S CHICKEN RICE,btohqsg
notice the years as well  the email was sent to 3 diff years of cohort and 6 diff schools,btohqsg
Shld be like D** and his kimbap,btohqsg
Yup 3 diff cohorts in 6 diff schools..all the students was sent the email basically,btohqsg
I still prefer minister ong ye kung over him 😭,btohqsg
sorry non stem students are not allowed to eat my chicken rice,btohqsg
I see   the student involvement in mass mailing getting punishment?,btohqsg
Once i start  I will be banned for causing diarrhea,btohqsg
Isn't Wyatt in physics in the same trench with u,btohqsg
idk  but a ton of students did the mass emailing,btohqsg
What's with the elitism we are all gonna be unemployed either ways,btohqsg
Ironic cus iestin is employed in his own business,btohqsg
sorry i simply cannot serve my chicken rice to someone who doesnt see the integral sign at least once a day,btohqsg
I mean i see it daily,btohqsg
geylang is 8 times cheaper than that...,btohqsg
i was gonna do a your mom joke,btohqsg
Cus your mom would scold iestin,btohqsg
I mean my mum will probably just question why lestin,btohqsg
Hmm feel like i nvr heard of him before 😭,btohqsg
napping at this time isn’t called a nap sir,btohqsg
This man has 500+ slides to cram for wednesday afternoon midterms,btohqsg
Oh wow he woke up after 15 mins,btohqsg
When does a nap cross the threshold to sleep,btohqsg
i’m debating asking someone to help me sign attendance for lab ta tmr,btohqsg
No i aint even gone to sleep yet,btohqsg
Dont need debate just do it,btohqsg
the people i’m helping with the experiment finished two weeks ago,btohqsg
but i still want my hours,btohqsg
With how the market is right now?,btohqsg
i mean they need to be smart enough to not do it when kathy is there,btohqsg
I think reality is the nightmare,btohqsg
Idk based on my experience kathy is never in lab,btohqsg
she is at the start of the sessions,btohqsg
I think he never come early to see her,btohqsg
Ahh if anyone bus enthusiasts here tell me coz I know a channel on YouTube that record bus journeys for upload 😅😅,btohqsg
anyone who's that much of a bus enthusiast would probably already know of those channels,btohqsg
This one run by my friend ... he went to bus upper deck and film,btohqsg
1 subscriber only and he does it for fun I guess,btohqsg
i am sure there are many here,btohqsg
Is like he goes to bus upper deck and film on bus window,btohqsg
As you all may know or ppl wanting to study overseas may know  there are exams that test English ability like TOEFL test for example.... since covid 19 toefl test can be done at home right ? I was actually wondering sth rather sinister,btohqsg
What if some ppl manipulate or subvert webcam used to display deepfake videos of them doing the test when in actual fact they looking at cheat sheets ? 😳😱😢😳,btohqsg
honestly if you have to cheat to do well enough for the toefl  you're just shooting yourself in the foot,btohqsg
it's testing basic english ability  not like o/a levels,btohqsg
😂😂😂 true though   ultimately even if they pass through cheating  they don't understand what the lecturer is teaching in university,btohqsg
some of them may not show up to lectures tho,btohqsg
and then end up like translating also,btohqsg
if you have to cheat in toefl  you probably won't even understand the final exam,btohqsg
for one of the spms math mods,btohqsg
i think was like discrete math,btohqsg
the effort required to deepfake and stuff just for it is better off actually prepping for toefl,btohqsg
the prof allow the students to bring a dictionary,btohqsg
so like it is an add on to the cheatsheet,btohqsg
SG will deem it as unauthorised material,btohqsg
honestly when he said that we were shocked,btohqsg
english reading/speaking/listening/writing test for western universities because they still think people in singapore cannot speak english,btohqsg
the best part is it's completely inconsistent,btohqsg
some unis in the states recognise sg  some don't,btohqsg
standardized english testing is all over the fking place like the UK and commonwealth countries use IELTS  which is run by British Council,btohqsg
when I did my IELTS I saw a lot of white kids who clearly did their entire education in singapore but because singapore is in china or whatever  they have to prove that they can speak english,btohqsg
yeah i took the IELTS when applying for my phd  and i remember having a similar experience,btohqsg
when I applied for australia  they accepted my A Levels as proof that I can speak english and I think they generally accepted proof that your education was conducted mostly in english,btohqsg
i did chat with the person giving me my speaking test  and even she agreed it's pretty dumb that singaporeans need to take it,btohqsg
Lmao HK is worse cuz China the IELTS cost more a lot cross the border and do it in HK instead,btohqsg
But now they close it i think only HK residents can do IELTS in HK,btohqsg
Maybe the British Council should mandate that,btohqsg
Thai scammer numbers in my Tele  AGAIN...,btohqsg
RP peeps: how's club life in RP?,btohqsg
i mean i joined the soi club..but never attended any events,btohqsg
ouh you gonna have fun with that course,btohqsg
nah its actually fun  you will learn alot of diff programmes/coding  thats what rp does,btohqsg
i learnt 4/5 diff analytical programmes/applications in 13 lessons for one lesson,btohqsg
I have a friend in common ICT,btohqsg
will be quite shag but shld be fine,btohqsg
Rp still can go local uni..but need to work double hard,btohqsg
Cause RP is more of presentation and report writing..follow usa style,btohqsg
One thing I dislike about coding is to debugging,btohqsg
I am sure programmers know this uh   one single error and you potentially have to search for thousands of lines of code just to find what actually went wrong,btohqsg
Ah yes. The ptsd of every science major's coding lesson 😭,btohqsg
My lecturer told me way back in 1990s coding is even worse than that 😂😂😂,btohqsg
They have to code the interface and everything manually...,btohqsg
does anybody know how to draw boolean circuits,btohqsg
"I want to ask everyone here for comments here as you all know I am still in process of ""upgrading"" stats materials by studying jc stuff and gc functionality on emulator",btohqsg
But I not sure if my pure math material needed similar upgrades ? I checked my h2 mathematics book none of the topic I written so far needed gc functionality?,btohqsg
wah no more pasir ris-punggol alr,btohqsg
punggol will be on is own,btohqsg
then pasir ris will go with changi,btohqsg
Which is so weird their grc,btohqsg
here Tampines-West GRC and Changkat SMC,btohqsg
East Coast GRC no more East Coast plan,btohqsg
In USA it will be declared unconstitutional 😂😁😂,btohqsg
I heard of ppl who tried to do this in US and supreme court order them to redraw the map 😂😂😂,btohqsg
But then US is not safe so .... not sth for them to be proud of 😳,btohqsg
bro where did you get that info from,btohqsg
it's still a massive problem all across state elections,btohqsg
But then note that vox news is supporting democratic party,btohqsg
So the way they reported it might be biased,btohqsg
history SBQ 101: all sources are biased  but you still have to explain how this bias affects their analysis,btohqsg
So take the news with a grain of salt...  especially deepfaking AI is on the rise,btohqsg
vox is generally speaking a pretty factual source (media bias fact check ground news ad fontes)  though yes they do lean left,btohqsg
"like ""beware of deepfaked videos and fake news"" is valid advice  but saying take a very factual news source with ""a pinch of salt"" because there's deepfaked news is like",btohqsg
"""it rained this morning  beware of earthquakes while you're out""",btohqsg
"""the sun is very hot  murder is illegal""",btohqsg
Depends on type of news haha,btohqsg
If the news is factual like natural disaster warning  it can be trusted,btohqsg
But political  nope   the US has issues with how their media outlets report stuff 😅😅,btohqsg
"the implication that there's a connection between ""vox news is left-leaning and pretty factually accurate"" and ""deepfaked news is on the rise and you should be careful"" either implies that you're anyhowly hedging your bets and warning people to be cautious  or you think vox news is on the same level as fake news",btohqsg
like real quick  have you taken history/GP?,btohqsg
push for people to read and discern themselves not just take with a grain of salt,btohqsg
Yup   that's what I trying to mean haha   someone got my words,btohqsg
your words and intentions don’t line up,btohqsg
I know USA has ground news too so,btohqsg
like for an example of a genuinely bad example of a news outlet  New York Post is full of sensationalized news stories (MBFC),btohqsg
ground news isn't a news outlet hahaha,btohqsg
it collects news stories and shows multiple outlets at once,btohqsg
They warn of potential bias of political news even though they not news outlets,btohqsg
I watched vox video many times before so i know they lean Democrat,btohqsg
But then vox seem to employ good video editors team .... their video is well edited ...,btohqsg
With deepfaking on the rise   ppl have also been scammed by AI generated content. Can already imagine if unscrupulous news outlets use it to fake information during election day 😂😂😂,btohqsg
U all no watch what triump is trying to do?  He's trying to make 🇺🇸 go bust,btohqsg
Some china people commented his way is brilliant 👏,btohqsg
🇺🇸 is heading for bust anyway,btohqsg
why do people believe in deep fake videos?,btohqsg
some deepfakes are really really realistic,btohqsg
its a big problem in NC,btohqsg
But if usa fall..sg also fall,btohqsg
a lot of people believe that Zelenskyy slaps Trump ...,btohqsg
even though that is 100% fake,btohqsg
That's why I not putting videos of myself online 😅😅,btohqsg
but being on social media already leak private stuff?,btohqsg
I have practically no presence on social media these days,btohqsg
I dun post selfie online like others,btohqsg
Instagram account I used to have but to post stray animal photo 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Deleted long ago too 😂😂😂 so hmm ...,btohqsg
Just be careful with what you want to share online and know video can be manipulated,btohqsg
Ahhh I dun have selfie on profile photo on telegram,btohqsg
I am sure the cat won't mind getting deepfaked 👍👍😅 (okay cats can't object to being deepfaked anyway),btohqsg
But it gets attention from the community   food and water are provided to the cat practically everyday   so yeah ... including a nearby school's staff who already have cats in her house,btohqsg
If I reveal the school I will effectively reveal where I live haha so .... not revealing it but the cat gave birth to 5 kittens in 2 separate occasions,btohqsg
oh i thought its where you work or study,btohqsg
Haha cats picture from a photography standpoint is difficult to take,btohqsg
I deem this photo suitable for sharing   no blurr or problems .... this is a shot taken by random chance,btohqsg
I mostly play on probability when taking cat photography   the more I take  the more expected number of photo of good quality I take,btohqsg
If op dm second hand gc  I gonna recommend  and upvote the comment on carousel platform too.,btohqsg
otherwise can learn how to draw on Latex.,btohqsg
Yup thanks   I also think it is cute,btohqsg
Think the group has AI bots that detect for suspicious users who joined for spamming,btohqsg
omg i got hired by a political party to make graphics,btohqsg
🥰🥰 im 16 can add to my eae portfolio,btohqsg
Think can uh if you pursuing a future career as graphic design,btohqsg
Ahh but you need qualifications in graphics design too I think,btohqsg
Should be Content and Advertising Spam,btohqsg
In that context  one example is Microsoft Mathematics,btohqsg
But now idk if they provide it now 😅😅,btohqsg
dk if sage or maple counts,btohqsg
Didn't they went through hyperinflation years ago ?,btohqsg
You can pay your workers in millions to save cost hiring from other 3rd world country,btohqsg
Lol ! I shouldn't be laughing 😂😂 as hyperinflation is quite serious issue but I am laughing real hard.,btohqsg
Slavery used to be legal not long ago 😳,btohqsg
But then it begs the question   what if AI bots become evolved as smart as humans?,btohqsg
AI cant even answer my physics questions,btohqsg
it'll take some time for it to be as smart as humans,btohqsg
how can it be a user error if i just slap the qns into AI and they cant even answer it,btohqsg
Gotta ask it in a format it can understand,btohqsg
If a Martian is unable to understand English. Would you automatically conclude that it is dumb?,btohqsg
A martian isnt a byproduct of humans,btohqsg
AI is something created by us to be able to mimic us  so its logical to conclude that if it cannot do the very thing that it is supposed to do  then it is dumb?,btohqsg
im asking it to mimic a physics genius to answer my qns and it cant :(,btohqsg
I won't call ChatGPT as something create to mimic us,btohqsg
It can mimic us but it's purpose and as product isn't for mimicry,btohqsg
The data set is used as a product to automate and compute more efficiently,btohqsg
In the same ways computers made things more efficient,btohqsg
all that efficient computation with all the data base they can access and they somehow still cant answer my physics questions?,btohqsg
As i said its a formating issue.,btohqsg
If you explain the problem to ChatGPT,btohqsg
And asked for a logical solution,btohqsg
If i can understand the problem  surely chatgpt  supposedly created by humans  would be able to understand it,btohqsg
Or at least the most probable one,btohqsg
It doesn't understand in the same way humans do,btohqsg
It understand words as binary code juxtaposed and in occurrence tgt,btohqsg
aite i suppose that is a point,btohqsg
Well   things is humans vs bots ... bots requires a lot of infrastructure to mimic even a fraction of human intelligence,btohqsg
That is using today's tech ofc,btohqsg
But in future things may be different,btohqsg
I use chat gpt to format my notes,btohqsg
i mean try uncensored AI with MYAB,btohqsg
Anyone have a interest in cars? If so I present to you this smol car,btohqsg
this car technically should be scrapped.,btohqsg
+ 10 years COE I'm surprised it is still here.,btohqsg
i nvr understand why ppl wna buy msia car in sg,btohqsg
i see 2000s era mercedes in sg all the time,btohqsg
Spotted both of these at my workplace last yr,btohqsg
I have interest in public transport vehicles 😅😅,btohqsg
The grey car is a dc5 integra,btohqsg
There's Alot of changes to the public transport landscape,btohqsg
I bet you are having a hard time keeping up with all the new taxis and buses,btohqsg
Haha I more into bus and trains,btohqsg
I have a computer dedicated to playing train simulation systems,btohqsg
Dunno how much to renew and maintain that COE . Surely over 10 years not cheap 😆,btohqsg
for these ppl not about the money,btohqsg
Also given Malaysians cars generally fails after 5 years. 😂,btohqsg
for ppl w msia car... maybe it's cheap to maintain lor compared to buying new car,btohqsg
TLDR. Still need to be rich at the first place. 😂,btohqsg
having a car in sg means rich alr,btohqsg
Coe is peg to the car's original bought pricing or is it a diff set of pricing?,btohqsg
Recently my dad sold my family 2005 Proton Waja to scrap for RM1.2k 😂 it’s engine dead tho,btohqsg
first Google Result. 😂 I'm not familiar with Singaporean COE system.,btohqsg
Btw  anyone here knows someone that worked at Calvin Klein b4? Asking for a friend,btohqsg
or other more moderate clothings from CK?,btohqsg
"Keyword ""AT"" not With or for",btohqsg
Ye  the ones google always give me always include some wacky ahh modification to the car I'm actually sourcing,btohqsg
"if the studio is ""AT"" CK. I think Modelling at CK office is applicable. 😂Might need to give more descriptive like work at ""CK"" retail or HQ?",btohqsg
then no. I only know my friend who are Female Models for CK and other brands.  But Malaysian Market la. 😂,btohqsg
Hey sg also scrap value for cars 💀,btohqsg
not sell to Malaysia / other countries ? 😂,btohqsg
"then the ""scrap"" companies resell to other countries",btohqsg
We do  we part out the cars and sell each part to other countries,btohqsg
But there are exceptions where we just crush or destroy the whole car,btohqsg
Public transport vehicles as a example,btohqsg
need a girls pov on how i can improve my leomatch profile😭,btohqsg
I can pretend to be a girl,btohqsg
Leomatch ? Dating app uh ?,btohqsg
Okay I see ... telegram bot for matching use ...,btohqsg
Think you may want to get a good profile photo of yourself first uh if you haven't gt one yet best is sth that shows your interest haha,btohqsg
As with any dating app .... dun edit the photo ...,btohqsg
How to improve if cannot see your current profile,btohqsg
To h1 or drop entirely? 😳,btohqsg
Find that maths is often the ' culprit ' subject causing stress for jc students,btohqsg
Nothing is inherently wrong with math as there are ppl who excel in it but seen lots of post complaining about the subject especially at h2,btohqsg
because there are some tutors that ask you to memorise the steps,btohqsg
Just split the Maths into 3-4 parts.Pure Maths 1  Pure Math 2  Statistics 1  Statistics 2.And threat them as individual subjects.Somewhat an unfair advantage to some one who is good at Stats but horrible at Pure Maths.,btohqsg
I nearly failed Cambridge A-Level Maths. Still managed to get As for 4/5 University Engineering Mathematics Modules.,btohqsg
Tbh we have h1 math  h2 math and h2 further maths,btohqsg
Just judge the component type to separate modular papers easier.  Because in some other Exam boards like Pearson EdExcel  the Maths/Science components are splits into modular papers.Students tend to do patching by resitting the poorly performed module. Then the overall results for Maths would come out.But I still prefer for Maths components to be split 😂,btohqsg
If ive been failing math since psle but still insist on doing math all the way even till uni level,btohqsg
Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.Albert Einstein,btohqsg
Also speaking about Fmath   anyone know  what order of topics should I take to study for it if I've already learnt the full H2 Math syllabus ?,btohqsg
And theyre right because idk why i put myself through this torture,btohqsg
From what my Friends who took the International 9231 FM syllabus.They told me it is much easier than regular Maths 9709 syllabus.I don't take FM. But I took some of these modules before in Uni / International A-Level syllabus.[What I read on the SEAB Syllabus]Algebra and Calculus1.1 Complex numbers1.2 Polar coordinates1.3 Applications of definite integrals1.4* Functions of two variables1.5 Differential equationsDiscrete Mathematics  Matrices and Numerical Methods2.1 Recurrence relations2.2 Matrices and linear spaces2.3 Numerical methods,btohqsg
1.1-1.4 better take it in sequence.,btohqsg
I think that is the UK syllabus,btohqsg
The singapore one is very diff,btohqsg
Ah ok that makes more sense,btohqsg
Recurrence is Maths Induction taught last time in H2 Maths? old old syllabus* (from what I saw from my cousin 2012/13 notes),btohqsg
Math induction was never taught in h2 maths,btohqsg
Well for my batch at least idk abt the others,btohqsg
Cus the H2 FM subject used to be discontinued and then continued,btohqsg
If I were to say to my score of easiness to hardness :.Numerical Methods -> Matrices -> ODEs -> 1.1-1.4 -> Recurrence -> Linear Spaces.,btohqsg
I would say spend more time on Linear Spaces first.,btohqsg
Numerical Methods  saw the syllabus seems identical to 9709 Maths Paper 2/3.The newer 9231 Math Syllabus (2018 onwards) removed alot of things in Linear Spaces I believe. As the paper was split into AS and A2. From 2 papers (Further Pure + Further Stat/Mechanics) to 4 papers [ FP1 / FP2 / FMech / FStat ],btohqsg
do yall know if poly grads apply Uni and receive an offer   can we reject it ?,btohqsg
Pretty sure someone scanned the textbook for this online. If you plan to study without JC notes.Just need to take care of how you source Study Materials and compare the syllabi between Singapore and Cambridge syllabus. What you need / not need to study.I glanced through  seems mostly Identical learning outcomes.And just drill through harder JC's Prelim / Actual TYS.,btohqsg
you can delay offers  saying you might want to do some gap year. Before rejecting it.,btohqsg
it was in the old syllabus 9740  2016 and before,btohqsg
Yeah I can confirm   I had a h2 math book that had math induction   many years ago,btohqsg
was in syllabus 2016 and before,btohqsg
I took an unconventional approach to improving my stats at poly - using jc notes to study poly probability distribution  it worked for my case but it won't work in reverse ofc (i.e. studying jc stats using poly notes won't work then and won't work now),btohqsg

Hopefully good weather tonight! Would wanna see Blood moon Eclipse fall on my birthday hehe.,btohqsg
tonight totallity around 2am not mistaken,btohqsg
nopes seems like an US thing  I can go to sleep tonight 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
i can still see the image when u reply to it,btohqsg
Considering we have members here 💀 who are below 18   such post is off the limit,btohqsg
I was in fb group and gt promoted to admin after having help the group write math materials,btohqsg
I seen a lot of indecent post in the group ...,btohqsg
Why the weather so humid haiz,btohqsg
Wtf the auntie infront of me balling in the ezlink...$400+ 💀,btohqsg
Well someone posted indecent image and the post got removed,btohqsg
RP peeps: what's the process for starting a new CCA?,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/live/YvmxoxVciikStill have a few hours til this ends,btohqsg
but its still live streaming the moon exiting the Earth's shadow stage,btohqsg
Anyone know how to cope with exam stress...  i just failed a bunch of tests lol damn sad,btohqsg
Go back  find out why you failed  which concepts youre weak at  study up on those then redo the test again,btohqsg
Failing isnt inherently a bad thing,btohqsg
that's not exam stress. That's stress from not knowing what to do.Key things(1) Did you study before the exams?(2) How long did you study? Do you think it was sufficient?(3) How did you conduct your revision? Do you think it was effective?(4) Anything you could have done better?,btohqsg
I didnt rly study and crammed 2 wks before,btohqsg
Think i need to start earlier,btohqsg
I agree. Exams is a form of feedback mechanism.Failing just means that you didn't do something right. So just go back and fix what was not right,btohqsg
2 weeks before seems like a lot of time damn,btohqsg
depending on the level  the higher the level  the more the consistency of revision needed,btohqsg
you can do it. If you think procrastination is the problem  then set a timetable and plan your work.,btohqsg
no  the most important thing now is to look through your mistakes  and at least for the maths and science subjects  redo the questions one round.It will help you greatly.,btohqsg
no point starting early if your way of working through it is fundamentally flawed,btohqsg
like imo if you're alr solid there  two weeks is enough to stop yourself from failing,btohqsg
Well for my case  during my n levels year  I started serious exam mugging like months before the paper  you may be taking a different paper but the idea is similar ---  last minute mugging simply don't work,btohqsg
When you mugging last minute   your body isn't used to the pace you see  so my teacher try to create a class culture of incremental studying   every day the study load increase a bit and going on full load weeks before the exam date,btohqsg
I see i see good points ya,btohqsg
I can share that the reason why i didnt do as well for As was because i priortised quantity instead of qualityDo tys  havent even read through mistakes  start doing another year. Then another year. And then another year. Then in the end never even correct myself and retry the papers with all my errors,btohqsg
I think if you are able to distill and pinpoint the chapters youre bad at  do the topical revisions for them again  youll do fine the next time around,btohqsg
Assuming you actually do learn from all your mistakes,btohqsg
Are you from jc  poly  ite or uni?,btohqsg
i think this john guy likes carti a lil too much,btohqsg
I am fortunate i didnt see the first then 😭,btohqsg
Hi guys just asking is buying notes from Carousell worth it,btohqsg
Or do u all use holy grail,btohqsg
Like I’m taking a lvls this yr no tution and stuff im just gonna use holy grail,btohqsg
Mmm tbh i didnt rlly outsource when i was doing j2,btohqsg
But approaching a levels  holy grail saved me,btohqsg
Idk if I shud get tution tbh,btohqsg
Like during jc u never got tution or Anyt?,btohqsg
Just holy grail and school notes?,btohqsg
I’m tryna retake during ns lol,btohqsg
Were u from a top tier jc,btohqsg
But wld say my score was not bad,btohqsg
U did find for As right,btohqsg

Applications close on 21 March 2025 (HMA  CCS and CNS).Herefor more information on the available scholarships.If you have any burning questions about the scholarships  theAMAon r/sgexams is still available.,btohqsg
BuI u just used sch notes only ah,btohqsg
I wld say i asked my classmates,btohqsg
So basically it’s purely sch notes and u use holy grail last few weeks to was ah,btohqsg
If i recalled i did spam thru my tys during June holidays,btohqsg
Then i used whatever resources i had,btohqsg
For like other jcs prelim papers,btohqsg
I’m tryna retake to get 85+ this time,btohqsg
How come you want to score an 85 tho,btohqsg
“Top tier jc notes” and specialised,btohqsg
So idk if I shud get it,btohqsg
And get the course I want,btohqsg
I missed it by a few rp,btohqsg
And I can retake in ns,btohqsg
But I think they lowkey scamming tho,btohqsg
Which course if you dont mind me asking?,btohqsg
Actually tbh for most scholarships would be ok with ppl having 80+ or above,btohqsg
i mean if you want to  you can go ahead and retake during ns  but honestly  i do believe your score is quite good uh,btohqsg
I have 3 courses I’m interested in lol,btohqsg
I only can enter 1 due to rp requirments,btohqsg
If not everyone in the nation can get a scholarship already by just 80+,btohqsg
i mean of course still need portfolio uh,btohqsg
I kinda messed up my sciences tho during As,btohqsg
but anyways  which courses are you interested in?,btohqsg
Wtf did i just see bro,btohqsg
Thats not how i anticipated seeing a dpic,btohqsg
i cannot believe i actually saw it,btohqsg
Personally I wouldnt recommend buying it,btohqsg
Esp for notes  I do find it like a waste of money,btohqsg
at most  you can find the notes in holy grail (ok tbh i dont know if can find notes in holy grail uh  but definitely past year prelims),btohqsg
i still do think that school notes are sufficient as notes,btohqsg
If you want buy from popular store   i was reading through r/SGExams and found that some ppl bought notes which are plagiarised from holy grail 😳😱💀,btohqsg
lol at this rate i rather buy assessment bks instead of the plagarised notes,btohqsg
"speaking of which  do you know if holy grail has ""jc notes""?",btohqsg
i havent used it for a long time every since i finished a levels,btohqsg
"is that a qn or like are you saying like ""yes they do upload""?😂",btohqsg
My material for pure math is up there but not recommended for now unless the person is in really desperate need 😅😅,btohqsg
Yes I seen exam papers uploaded there,btohqsg
nope like if you're below 85  you're alr gonna be cut out of most scholarships unless you have an insanely good portfolio,btohqsg
Because ppl have mentioned my way of teaching may not suit jc students and indeed that's the case.,btohqsg
So I only recommend it under last resort,btohqsg
I trying to work out ways to improve my understanding of the techniques how h2 students learn math before releasing notes for routine uses,btohqsg
I thought some Chem and gp notes from there already haha,btohqsg
Under 87.5 is already no scholarships,btohqsg
My friend said 88 is bonded and 90 is non bonded,btohqsg
not necessarily  but yea the number of people getting high rp is too inflated for <85 to get you anywhere,btohqsg
Wonder how 70rp will affect it,btohqsg
Probably perfect score 70rp is key to get scholarships.  At best you need 67.5/70 rp,btohqsg
Happy Pi Day to everyone and Happy Term 1 School Holidays to all students!,btohqsg
i often procrastinate a lot so i can understand the feeling of being weeks behind lectures and the stress of failing the exams. i learnt that most people do well with mind maps (i interviewed most of the ppl who score 3.7 and above fr gpa). my advice is try experimenting the different styles of learning best catered to your needs. if u are tired and procrastinate a lot  have a light revision. being consistent is the key to good grades. if you’re a last minute crammer  focus on the important information on your notes  past year papers  worksheets and read thru the textbook.imo  tuition have both benefits and disadvantages. a student can greatly benefit from tuition if they have great attitude to study.  i feel that most tuition notes or lecturers are quite repetitive to the textbook. however  if u need extra help and coaching from tuition teacher to understand the topics  don’t be afraid to reach out. u cn also ask ur frnds and teachers questions that you’re unsure of and they will help you out. most teachers  in fact all  care about every individual student and want to bring the best out of them. don’t be afraid and reach them for help.,btohqsg
Anyone here studying in the UK right now?,btohqsg

I was in ITE for a couple of weeks while waiting for pfp admission results and while the school has bad reputation at least ITE trying to do sth about it by facilities improvement,btohqsg
They could be or maybe not real but I'll tell you what is fact  they make up very few percentage of the world.Drop shipping is a very lucrative business  you need to know your demand and customer base very well  it's not as easy as it looks,btohqsg

No worries   you will get used to it but there is sth I need you to be mentally prepared,btohqsg

Atleast it accelerated Online Learning  or atleast make teachers somewhat competent in using Computers and Digitalizing their Lectures lol,btohqsg
i rmb the yall had to do pt on zoom calls,btohqsg
The zoom lesson is not as good,btohqsg
depends on people to people  and how well the lecture was prepared.,btohqsg
I just don't like heading to Lectures. It's always 1 hour+ ended up in traffic jam  and another hour headed back home.Then there's those genius 3-4 hours lecture gaps....,btohqsg
Library Sofa was the place to sleep with a blanket.,btohqsg

You mean diseases that is more deadly than covid uh,btohqsg
He cracked the code for infinite series of pi during a plague outbreak while he was in isolation,btohqsg
'Disease X ' a hypothetical future epidemic that could be 20 times more deadly than COVID-19.,btohqsg
I think pre 1990s HIV epidemic considered deadly already,btohqsg
I was thinking maybe if existing diseases agent might mutate to cause even more deadly consequences,btohqsg
Nowadays it is treatable to an extent the virus reach undetected levels and hence keeping the virus potential harm under control,btohqsg
Tbh when vaccines are researched  it is very difficult to get one out for hiv virus. if someone can come out with sth that is effective enough to be able to deal with HIV infections I guarantee it will be all over the news for sure,btohqsg
got offered an interview with TP for computer engineering  what questions should I prepare?,btohqsg
