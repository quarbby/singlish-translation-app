Some people who have applied in previous launches have gotten their ballot number and are waiting for flat selection appointment  but maybe number not great so they apply for the coming launch too. While they add to the application number of the launch  they may still take up the previous launch once they choose flat so then they would have dropped from the queue for current launch. And apparently this makes up 20% of the overall applications for each launch.,btohqsg
correct  that is also what I understand,btohqsg

Hi all!  I would like to ask all the pros here whether HDB will review ceiling cap for HLE during key collection for BTOs?Previously I have gotten a HLE approved when i selected my flat about 3 years ago....Today  my wife and I have 'busted' the salary cap of $14 000 but would like to continue with HDB loan  anyone can advise whether we are still eligible? we are collecting keys in the next 6 months,btohqsg

Hi can i check if anyone knows why my application with my fiancee for a SBF at woodlands is under public scheme? is it cos the amount of flats available less than 20 so is only public scheme? even tho i filled the form as my fiancee as co applicant,btohqsg
I was thinking why they write public scheme,btohqsg
is it? cos on HDB website there is 2 different schemes  1 for public and 1 is FiancÃ©/FiancÃ©e Scheme,btohqsg
Yes I applied 5 times under fiance scheme and itispublic scheme,btohqsg
this was what one of the person in the SBF telegram told me ah  but im not a 100% sure,btohqsg

Hello! Does any one knows if I need to apply for a new HLE (esp since the LTV dropped to 80%)?Applied for our HLE in June  expiring in Dec. But our SBF results will only be out in Feb 2023. This means our HLE has expired and no longer valid?Or we can use the same HLE letter since it was since valid when we did the SBF application aka now? :â€™),btohqsg
May I check is there a way to edit the BTO application form?,btohqsg
yes  theres an amend button on the application page  but the type of flat cannot be amended i think.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how to calculate the Application Rate for First Timers (4rm)ðŸŒš. Like how many applicants in 1.2?,btohqsg
0.95 x no. of available flats in that flat type x application rate shown under first timers = number of ppl that applied for that flat type,btohqsg
