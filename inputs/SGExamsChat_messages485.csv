but there will always be ppl better than u applying for the same thing?,btohqsg

so u can guess how tight it isâ€¦,btohqsg
but thinkinh reapply next year change course haha,btohqsg
i cldnt even enter the chs area during open house eh,btohqsg
it was such a longgg snaking queue,btohqsg
oh yea btw..i got my poly cgpa,btohqsg
ask u ah  is it true rp difficult to score 4.0?,btohqsg
lol it really really depends on your major and cohort,btohqsg
for NBS thereâ€™s the gpa tryhards  the do sorta enough but focus on portfolio  and thereâ€™s the go into NBS without knowing what to do with it,btohqsg
yea he final yr already...he is suppose to graduate in may,btohqsg
but he failed one of his modules form the convo,btohqsg
what he working as b4 studying?,btohqsg
so...he cant graduate  he have to spend at least 6 months on that one module before he can graduate,btohqsg
from the looks...something related to nursing,btohqsg
he in the kids department isit hahahaha,btohqsg
Smtg to do in healthcare forgot what,btohqsg
he is no longer a student,btohqsg
wait can i ask what evidences hall have to show heâ€™s a perv,btohqsg
hence why he have to appeal to get back in,btohqsg
haha he fail too many module ah,btohqsg
iâ€™ve missed out on too much,btohqsg
TLDR:Dismissal from the school will only occur if youfail two modules within two consecutive semestersOrfail one module consecutively across three semesters,btohqsg
i messed up the name so bad yet I left it ther for months,btohqsg
likely...he failed the same module 3 semesters in a row,btohqsg
or if u ask ppl if they are single,btohqsg
like how do yâ€™all know that,btohqsg
I suppose to graduate but now I can't graduate because I failed one of the module and I have been dismissed from RP and now need to appeal to go back,btohqsg
He have no choice but either have to take a part time diploma or not have a diploma at all,btohqsg
i doubt his appeal will be accepted,btohqsg
he look older then my father,btohqsg
i always add him in alor of grp,btohqsg
i ask him go troll hahahaha,btohqsg
no wonder rp kick him out,btohqsg
can someone give me a tldr,btohqsg
in rp  if you are late for 3 lessons...you are likely to fail the module,btohqsg
sp got 15min grace period b4 count as late,btohqsg
basically he just hit up on a lot of girls from poly chats tho heâ€™s 28 and ask them if theyâ€™re single and make girls feel uncomfortable and reported to the respective poly chat admin. side tea: and den now he also cannot grad bcz he fail his mod 3 times,btohqsg
if one liddat I report u,btohqsg
maybe if he spent all that time hitting up people to study for the mod,btohqsg
best part...dismissal from rp is literally like the end,btohqsg
oh oop not supposed to und,btohqsg

I POP at the start of March,btohqsg
I enlisted back at the start of Jan,btohqsg
how do you talk and cry,btohqsg
for real tho...and here i am getting banned for showing my roblox gameplay,btohqsg
"cause ""my face must be on the camera""",btohqsg
im the only coherent person in that chat,btohqsg
You really looking for a girl  huh ,btohqsg
Alright  we'll be here if you want to open up :),btohqsg
why u bring uncle go walk,btohqsg
itâ€™s about weng ip  basically he hit up with every girl with a â€˜are u singleâ€™ so itâ€™s like a meme rn,btohqsg
my sleep cycle now also bad af,btohqsg
bro im so sorry  first youâ€™re Malay now youâ€™re 45?,btohqsg
i cannot kuro so funny u js meme atp,btohqsg
do i owe u 5 dollars,btohqsg
donâ€™t be Weng in poly bro pls stay safe,btohqsg
i totally forgot how u rmb,btohqsg
eh did u end up buying it,btohqsg
Huh? I thought this is a safe zone from horny people?,btohqsg
uh.. no rand is an example,btohqsg
pls cancel I mean donâ€™t cancel him,btohqsg
Which is the best brand for protein?,btohqsg
"Just go through the ""Kill Bill"" phase",btohqsg
if u thought rand is ugly,btohqsg
both lesbians and asexuals dl kink,btohqsg
I tot it was a bad word,btohqsg
lesbian also dw ur dick la,btohqsg
At least she ain't asexual aromantic?,btohqsg
no no bcz rei hern said some cancel material in nyp chat,btohqsg
and u were all flustered telling me abt giving each other candies along the walkway,btohqsg
having standards is an illness you should have had long time ago,btohqsg
If she's asexual  she wouldn't reciprocate any sexual advances at all?,btohqsg
Do asexual people find pleasure in sex or ?,btohqsg
some of them reciprocate out of societal pressure,btohqsg
oh yah and the suck issue,btohqsg
dang..out of all the convo  my eyes caught this,btohqsg
oh so theyâ€™re not meant to fuc,btohqsg
i assume yes but not emotionally,btohqsg
thereâ€™s a term people have used called greysexual and greyromantic since itâ€™s not always definite yes or no,btohqsg
So does that mean the act of sexual intercourse would be done to satisfy their partner but they receive no pleasure from it?,btohqsg
I mean I like to learn so gotta make it a learning journey at least,btohqsg
Oh  damn. So does that mean they would be fine alone without a partner?,btohqsg
i mean being asexual doesnâ€™t mean they donâ€™t fall in love,btohqsg
and that sort of thing can lead to wanting to satisfy the partner,btohqsg
if the girl likes ur dick im p sure shes not asexual,btohqsg
or just get that physical pleasure,btohqsg
Physical pleasure without emotional pleasure? You mean intimacy?,btohqsg
ig u can say it like that,btohqsg
typically asexuality is more of lack of desire or attraction but they can still enjoy the process,btohqsg
"So what does ""love"" mean in this context?",btohqsg
So they enjoy the heat of the moment only?,btohqsg
very broad and subjective question. but you can think of it as romantic gestures that typically arenâ€™t associated with sex,btohqsg
there are people that are aro but not asexual,btohqsg
JK...but they do look like they genuinely love each other tho,btohqsg
but bro got trolled to shit on tiktok,btohqsg
hey wat I like the weeknd,btohqsg
guys wat if one day u sick then open door Iâ€™m the docto what wld u do,btohqsg
