plus u Cnt look at short term.. just bcuz ur iPhone crack doesn't mean u need a new one..cpf is more impt in ur future even though you're 15. having some money in cpf is better than none :),btohqsg
at most if u rlly want then work more lor..,btohqsg
u cn ask one of ur parents to create a account with u.. so it's under both ur name and ur parents one btw :)),btohqsg
You will appreciate it next time,btohqsg
What is there not to trust about when the phone is literally factory reset when sold to you?,btohqsg
The cpf is counted from 500 onwards,btohqsg
if you're earning $501 u dunnit to contribute also,btohqsg
u can use the calculator from the cpf website,btohqsg
only at $502 u need to start contributing,btohqsg
isnt cpf like employer contribute in on top of ur salary?,btohqsg
employer n employee both contribute.. depending on how much you're getting paid,btohqsg
employer has to contribute no matter how much u earn  u only need to contribute after $500(but from cpf calculator it's after $501 onwards),btohqsg
and ofc employer contributes lesser compared to u,btohqsg
do correct me if I'm wrong btw,btohqsg

Why the topic on CPF again,btohqsg
CPF is not your worst enemy....IRAS is next,btohqsg
Last time me and another 'uncle' got chided by admin say what we dun understand poor kids and how cpf is impt for their daily lives etc....In the end is about buying iPhone...,btohqsg

Agree. Or repair screen. Save up for now...It will grow to substantial amt in future.When I was getting only $300 + a mth in army  it grew to a substantial amt and then use it for a saving plan say start with 30+ a mth.Or contribute to family expenses,btohqsg
I was also talking about some ppl 15 year old who are forced to work,btohqsg
So ur being forced to work to buy a new phone-?,btohqsg
Those I think the way forward apart from working is to find social help,btohqsg
But some 15 year old are forced to work to support their family,btohqsg
U might think it isn't important now,btohqsg
But you see later you will understand,btohqsg
IM TALKING ABOUT 15 YEAR OLD WHO NEED TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY NOT ME,btohqsg
Do u need that 20% that was sent to cpf?,btohqsg
Some 15 year old need it,btohqsg
I am not a walking google,btohqsg
