Bhs is medisave. FRS is SA.If hit either the cap. The interest alone is enough to cover frs or Bhs.,btohqsg
Curious: can use AMEX tcb to top up Singtel Dash  and use Singtel Dash to top up ezlink (via ezlink app)?,btohqsg

is 2 step procedure at bizfile (ACRA)  has to reserve the name before proceeding with second step. could be either immediately approved  appeal or referred or rejected. Fast - same day  slow up to 60 days,btohqsg

Hi any opinions on Amex Highflyer card? The current welcome offer is not the best in history right? Last year got free 40k points with first year fee waivedâ€¦,btohqsg
I think they fall under others category,btohqsg
for the hsbc promo  i applied for the card early this mth. today got approved. if i apply for the ega account  am i a new customer?,btohqsg
Just spend 1k. You are sure on the right track and can get up to 10k points,btohqsg
Just note that the points are accumulated from 1st to last of the month,btohqsg
Maybank platinum visa cashback can only be $30 or $100 right?,btohqsg

Hi  does anyone know the mcc for getgo?,btohqsg
Manual tracking with the mobile app,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ Why need prepay bill  just  pay back to your amex tcb account. Basically free money before the nerf.,btohqsg
"I don't think Breadtalk is under ""dining"" but cannot confirm",btohqsg
Did a review video on Wednesday  can check it out,btohqsg
Datapoints shown that if you applied for the card before the account  you have to head to physical branch,btohqsg
Yeah watched  just wondering if I should wait for next sign up promo and hope it might be better than current one haha,btohqsg
I waited for 6 months before i took action  it only got worse,btohqsg
Surprisingly the trust bank offer is quite good. Both referral got $10 FairPrice e-voucher and the first visa transaction got another $25 FairPrice e-voucher.,btohqsg
Should be because milelion did indicate BreadTalk as Uob merchants for dining. Suspect it will be fast food mcc.,btohqsg
Stack that on top of FairPrice $88 spent get $8 voucher and the daily offer with CNY coming. The saving is quite amazing!,btohqsg
