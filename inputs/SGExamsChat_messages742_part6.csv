Ahh okok. Anyway  Demo are learning to do what MAGA ppl do best,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why the 2 party system is    a shitshow,btohqsg
Anyway  if y‚Äôall free can google for two Rep politicians: Majorie Taylor Greene and Lauren BoebertAnd an ex-Rep politician: George SantosThey look like they sent by Comedy Central to entertain,btohqsg
Anyway I feel like it‚Äôs only natural in most cases that political opponents dig out dirt on each other. They only want to win  not focused on keeping everything civil and clean,btohqsg
Yes. But it felt like Rep did it more and better previously and Demo are trying to catch up in that game,btohqsg
Now George santos is leveraging on his stay in congress to grow his clout and popularity. I think he started selling videos on some online site where one earns him a few hundred bucks,btohqsg
Unfortunate this cycle is just going to keep perpetuating itself,btohqsg
She wants to switch districts to a safer Republican district just because she almost got voted out,btohqsg
Siao liao lorAlso  I think florida just passed bill to restrict TikTok to teens. I wonder how their teens are gonna react to it,btohqsg
Thankfully Ken buck saw this and resigned to force a special election so it would be harder to switch. Because with the new GOP incumbent (given that Ken Buck previously intended to leave the house at the end of the term)  it would be harder to win the primary,btohqsg
To block that switch  republican of that district just quit  forcing a by-election nowSo either Lauren also quit now to context there this year or next cycle she has to battle against another incumbent,btohqsg
Boebert also keeps lying lol. I rmbr one time she wanted to go into the house to vote against some bill but because she was like doing other stuff like partying she ran inside the house too late  and then later she lied on social media saying she missed the vote because she was tired of the political system or some bs  instead of saying she was late so she couldn‚Äôt indicate her stand against it. Later she was exposed and a video was uploaded showing her running inside congress while asking some staffer if she had missed the vote  and when the staffer replied yes she was like shit,btohqsg
Yeah thanks Ken Buck. Smart move,btohqsg
Now the Rep margin in the House is smaller. Even more exciting for Rep liao,btohqsg
MTG is also kind of a joke but she‚Äôs also helping to contribute to making the speaker‚Äôs life hell lol. It would be interesting to see if democrats decide to rescue the speaker this time unlike McCarthy,btohqsg
Can only afford to lose one vote soon,btohqsg
Too many resignations plus the George santos seat flipping to blue,btohqsg
Rep is rather disunited at this point,btohqsg
Dear Georgie is so funny. You know how Jimmy Kimmel ‚Äúpranked‚Äù him by getting him to read nonsense letters?,btohqsg
Hmm I‚Äôm not sure which one is it,btohqsg
I find it rude to use the term Karen but for MTG  I really think she is Queen K leh,btohqsg
But I rmbr Fetterman trolled Santos and got him to make a video in support of indicted senator Menendez (cos of the similarities of how both of them were charged and faced pressure to resign),btohqsg
Even though parents should be involved in taking care of their kids some of them are very irresponsible. Kids under 12 rly shouldn‚Äôt be on social media,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/iyoRHDkJKlo?feature=sharedSkip to 6:55 to watch Kimmel‚Äôs monologue,btohqsg
lol I wonder if we‚Äôre the only ones discussing cos this trump Biden thing is quite a heated topic or few ppl here rly care about us politics,btohqsg
How many times do i see a ‚Äònvm i forgot‚Äô after ‚Äòhi‚Äô,btohqsg
Ok then I guess I‚Äôll also not continue this convo. See you next time!,btohqsg
Oh shit sry I forgot I‚Äôll send now,btohqsg
Only rmbr randkmdkd asked for it just now,btohqsg
Mines not. Wheres your twin? I miss that guy also,btohqsg
Well at least he ain't as bad as the other guy that had train in his name,btohqsg
Of course I miss all of yall and this delulu place,btohqsg
Hi so tired I am E120,btohqsg
I never knew that you were Kuro‚Äôs twin,btohqsg
So tired just managed to smoke some stuff out during exam,btohqsg
I am in my 6th hour of a back to back seminar.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm so tired but can‚Äôt fall asleep,btohqsg
I have zero work to do in the office,btohqsg
My Prof is talking about the royal academy of Paris Idk anymore,btohqsg
