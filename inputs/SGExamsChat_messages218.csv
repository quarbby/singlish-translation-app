Oh btw will everyone be interviewed or just a select few from the application?,btohqsg
those shortlisted from our applicant poolthere's still a lot of unknowns when ppl fill up an applicstion form  so we try to give everyone a chance at an interview,btohqsg
we're q proud to be a fully volunteer run organisation,btohqsg

Does sgexams have like a ceo,btohqsg
Or is it a group of people,btohqsg
go make some good memories in NS,btohqsg
we have a hierarchy  if that's what you're asking,btohqsg
Was asking more along the lines of who are the people that started sgexams,btohqsg
it's... a complicated story.it started from students discussing exam stuff on the Singapore subreddit. then the Singapore subreddit mods got tired of the kids  then created the SGExams subreddit and kicked us there.from there our founder thought that there was something more that could come out of the subreddit  so he brought in more ppl  and the rest is history,btohqsg
our founder now not that active due to other commitments  but he took steps to ensure that the team can still function with him being less active,btohqsg
That first paragraph is actually quite interesting,btohqsg
ya it's q a funny story. he started moderating the Reddit during his a level period,btohqsg
Why isnt sgexams listed as a related subreddit on r/sg,btohqsg
we just haven't gotten around to doing that,btohqsg
with all our events and stuff,btohqsg
Sgexams seems like the biggest sg subreddit though,btohqsg
Thought the r/sg mods would put it there,btohqsg
we didnt ask r/sg to put us in the sidebar cause there were other priorities,btohqsg
pls correct any misinformation I might have spread,btohqsg
uni life is more shag than army frfr,btohqsg
well that's how it is i guess,btohqsg
lemme just dm their mod team and solve that issue,btohqsg
I swear i thought it was on there before though,btohqsg
"they have q a couple of ""SGsmth"" subreddits there I think",btohqsg
mass recruitment drives happen annually  but we're open to new members all year round,btohqsg
Thanks for answering my questions btw,btohqsg
SGExams beginnings are abit like SingaporeSingapore got kicked out of the Malaysian FederationSGExams got kicked out of r/sg,btohqsg
Why did SGExams get kicked out,btohqsg
so basically the older r/sg ppl got pissed off over exam threads,btohqsg
lemme find you the og thread,btohqsg
so all the education and exam stuff can go there,btohqsg
fast forward ~3 years and here we are,btohqsg
the rest is history like milo said,btohqsg
after this thread the mods locked everything related to student and studies,btohqsg
where's the comment that says yall are evicted,btohqsg
Okay so I got into an accounting course,btohqsg
What do you think about accounting ?,btohqsg
interesting but tedious  can get boring and bloody frustrating  you'll eat sleep shit numbers  but it's a stable career in the future,btohqsg
sleep in office during peak period let's go,btohqsg
deleted since there was ic number but feel free to send again cropping it out or wtv,btohqsg

Then you have people who intend to do Asian Studies for 4 years,btohqsg
I'm not one of them but mad respect,btohqsg
Yea majoring in Asian studies require some kind of commitment and passion but like as somebody from outside clearing basket or taking UEs got fun mods one,btohqsg
But they don't have the three basket requirement anymore,btohqsg
No fun mods for us sigh,btohqsg
But Asian studies is not a module what lol,btohqsg
I believe you still need to choose your kind of Asian studies,btohqsg
No such subject called Asian studies as of right now,btohqsg
I still don't know wtheck they mean by integrated humanities  integrated social sciences,btohqsg
because according to the talk  the exposure mod for major and the common core are 2 diff things,btohqsg
Asian studies is the amalgamation of the department the of SEA  SA  Japanese  Chinese  Malay studies  unless they actually create a general Asian studies mod you still can choose.,btohqsg
could very well be someinterdisciplinarycombination of all the regions put together and just know a bit of everything,btohqsg
Clearly states interdisciplinary  so highly likely they're crafting a single general mod,btohqsg
Though...... it would be very ironic if they actually create a general Asian studies mod  because Asia as we know it is an Eurocentric invention. Haha the mods generally in FASS  when they talk about the concept of Asia there will always be a “don’t be fooled by the name” essence  “Asia is a diverse region” heck SEA itself is diverse enough. I wonder how a general Asian mod would do justice lol,btohqsg
yeah  I mean I admit I'm not an expert but even H2 SEA History that's what they say all the time,btohqsg
Just imagine CHS curriculum as an enlarged version of GEMs,btohqsg
They're turning NUS into Yale-NUS gdi,btohqsg
By creating such a large common curriculum,btohqsg
Maybe Yale-NUS was just the beta test,btohqsg

ya sure want me to pm,btohqsg
its like kinda informal though LMAO for ss^,btohqsg
not formula sheet but like format,btohqsg
some people also scared to ask / sometimes teachers are busy or slow,btohqsg
anyway its fine to ask for help from other methods also thats what this group is for:-),btohqsg
we shouldn't shame people for asking for help :-),btohqsg
Is there holy grail for sec 1-4 exam papers?,btohqsg
Para 1: Why part of it is usefulPara 2: Why part of it is not usefulPara 3: Overall  useful or not useful,btohqsg
cross refer for reliability is what they mean probably,btohqsg
useful depends on qn  eg how is source a useful as evidence that....(eg source b's content) is true?so source a has to be similar to source b for it to be useful but if source a&b different also can be useful (propaganda? for history)so how u ans got different points awarded also,btohqsg
lmao i forgot all my ss formats so cant help much,btohqsg
if wna use bgi must rephrase  textbook stuff for srq,btohqsg
most likely bgi u use for like your first statement? like similar based on what different based on what,btohqsg
A level no have usefulness anymore le hahaI’m saying what I know from Os lol,btohqsg
Formats are devised tactics by students and Teachers  not decreed by Cambridge,btohqsg
Don’t concern yourself too much about formats  downside of knowing formats too well is you don’t know how to be flexible for curveballs,btohqsg
dont worry u just need to knw the format which is the most important n pls re-read the sources well n annotate the similarities btwn sources so its easier to do ur SBQ also when u look at the qns pls indicate what kind of format they are asking for.....most importantly pls read the sources well n understand it if not then bye bye to ur marks-advised,btohqsg
yep correct interpretation of the sources vv impt,btohqsg
yuppp be careful when they ask abt hybrid too cos sometimes ppl are confused with other format....,btohqsg
normally for usefulness just make sure to say that source somthing is useful in saying that..... always say useful cos u will get marks when u ATQ,btohqsg
yup thats the most important thing n pls dont overthink abt the sources cos SS paper can be written in simple sentences,btohqsg
maybe can try label the hybrid qns w which skills needed first,btohqsg
tbh u hv to be v clear with ur intepretations and make sure when u cr to provenance u need to try to write as detailed as possible to get the mark,btohqsg
yup can make sure to look at assertion qn too n annotate the sources whether it supports or not,btohqsg
but make sure to read the background info first**** very impt to knw the sources well like what they will be talking abt,btohqsg
bgi must rephrase! if not they know u copy oni,btohqsg
also srq pls dont use the info given at the start,btohqsg
background info cnnt be used for assertion but it can be used for cross reference,btohqsg
srq just make sure u read ur txtbk n understand content,btohqsg
well we arent sure so i jst say oni? haha doesn't matter right  can jst be a reminder.,btohqsg
sure will do dont be afraid to ask if u wan to be successful,btohqsg
ive got friends who shared their experience with me before,btohqsg
You got to do like inference for the first source you get in the question,btohqsg
"But don't write like ""i can infer from source X that...""",btohqsg
I = inference statementE = evidenceE= explanation,btohqsg
Then for your second para do another IEE for the other souce that was stated in the question,btohqsg
Last para you just evaluate of the source is useful or not base on tone/message/purpose/harsh words...,btohqsg
See if there is any biasness,btohqsg
My pure history sbq always 13 to 16,btohqsg
My max was 20 plus cuz i copied from my friend,btohqsg
My ss was around 18 to 20,btohqsg
Use this format for surprise reliability usefulness c&c,btohqsg
Or if the teacher loves you l1/2,btohqsg
I wished i could be as smart as you,btohqsg
Elec geog with ss plus pure hist,btohqsg
I hated ss to the point where i won't even submit my hw,btohqsg
But somehow managed to pass during prelim,btohqsg
Almost all her lesson was like self study,btohqsg
Literally asking us to read the tb,btohqsg
Then the class did the hw,btohqsg
She only gave a tick and we didn't even know what went wrong,btohqsg
In her Instagram she posted papers she had marked (which was the first paper of the stack),btohqsg
We all know 1 tick means received but not read,btohqsg
I bet she marked that only,btohqsg
Well that's what u will be called when u collect ur A level results after J2,btohqsg
Well  PU3 is essentially JC2 so I'm trying to make the distinction between JC3 and PU3.,btohqsg
Ok  so do you only retake your Main 4 subject in that year?,btohqsg
J3 has a lot of meanings,btohqsg
U can take it as someone who retain after J2,btohqsg
Or you can take it as someone who already graduated JC,btohqsg
Either retake in school or retake as private,btohqsg
If school then u take everything again,btohqsg
Ya but what subjects u need retake,btohqsg
Private just retake 3H2 and GP and whatever else you want,btohqsg
Well I refer to the official meaning in regards to a school candidate context.,btohqsg
Right  as JC is officially 2 years.,btohqsg
Gg its christmas alr and im broke af,btohqsg
All I want for Christmas is you  my money.,btohqsg

I can earn 125 if i work tmr,btohqsg

yup its too good to be tryeee,btohqsg
Eh any advise on what platform to use to invest in the major index funds?,btohqsg
yall how do i leave asap from a toxic household,btohqsg
i mean i would but its locked,btohqsg
and i would get beaten alive if i get caught,btohqsg
and im not financially stable yet,btohqsg
if it's worth anything  if there's legit fam violence  the police is on your side,btohqsg
If this is real  u can actually call the police,btohqsg
s/he will need physical evidence or video or audio recordings,btohqsg
otherwise they will just dismiss as family matters,btohqsg
If its family violence then its serious,btohqsg
And the police needs to be involved,btohqsg
yea but the person needs evidence  if there is physical mark I recommend going to a hospital to get it assessed by the doctor or getting a spypen to try to document the thing happening,btohqsg
Set up a camera and record,btohqsg
If anything happens  take the footage from the hidden camera and report it to the police,btohqsg
That’s all the evidence you need,btohqsg
how old are you and have you been physically abused?,btohqsg
Realistically you cant do anything on your own. Living at a friends house or a relatives one seems unfeasible due to school and possibility of parents filimg a police report making it seem youre a delinquent. As others have said the best thing to do is to report to the police as the police and the courts heavily favour the child in cases of domestic violence. But theyre also right when they say you need evidence but it is easy to get it nowadays as you can record it. Good luck,btohqsg
if everything fails then you have no choice but to just study hard move to hostel if you are planning to go to university  move out once you are able to..,btohqsg
all the best ya keep fighting! dont ever let toxic parents stand in the way of you having a good future you deserve a lot better,btohqsg
Any students studying in UK before the callback?,btohqsg
Id like to ask a few questions,btohqsg
how old is she or he or whoever,btohqsg
I swear i remember there was one person here,btohqsg
If im not wrong it was you or someone else haha,btohqsg
Not me shd be someone else haha,btohqsg
I rmbr they went to another uni imperial if im not wrong,btohqsg
this is probably irrelevant but why is there an age requirement to comment in r/singapore,btohqsg
idk what that means im stupid lol,btohqsg
That’s to create a Reddit account,btohqsg
WaitAccount age requirement as in your account has to be certain days/weeks/months old to comment is it?,btohqsg
That’s reasonable to prevent spam or bots from abusing the subreddit,btohqsg
i just joined reddit like september lol,btohqsg
r/singapore has standardsThe admins there often remove duplicate posts  posts that are not intellectual enough  or posts that are not newsworthy enoughOtherwise it will be flooded with a lot of stuff every day,btohqsg
hais i just wanna ask some questions there😪,btohqsg
I think questions are fineIf they reject you can try r/askSingapore  I guess?,btohqsg
"May you please define ""posts that are not intellectual enough""  am I expected to give a response to government policies in the subreddit?",btohqsg
Okay not that high of a level lol,btohqsg
As in very boliao short-question posts like “what’s your favourite bus?” (I’ve seen that gotten deleted),btohqsg
Don’t worry about questionsJust need a little bit of effort,btohqsg
Maybe try commenting on the daily random talk thread,btohqsg
I see the Google maps right  the nearest bus stop got like a huge ass distance,btohqsg
or is there another convenient alternative,btohqsg
go in 700 come out 700,btohqsg
somemore like after a whole day,btohqsg
actly 700 is like at most 8 min walk,btohqsg
& if u go home w frens/classmate/wtv,btohqsg
it's a good time to catchup lol,btohqsg
actually I don't know whether 700 m anot lmao,btohqsg
Ya u won't even feel a thing if u just kept on talking with them,btohqsg
but isn't it weird lmaoprimary school secondary school and a JC in the same area but it's not very convenient,btohqsg
cfm will get used to it one,btohqsg
700m shldnt be the thing deterring u from gg to a sch,btohqsg
what about 8 minutes spent on bonding w classmates uwu,btohqsg

there's an academics dept in sgexams uwu,btohqsg
full list of roles here uwu,btohqsg
wow recruitment has revived john smith o_o,btohqsg
hi does anyone know if early admissions to uni is possible using cca just like Sec/jc?,btohqsg
cus I couldn't find this info online,btohqsg
your CCA can only be used for discretionary admission  early admission usually for those in army and want to matriculate a year earlier,btohqsg
only med or psc scholars can defer ns,btohqsg
early admissions you apply using prelim results/5th sem cgpa,btohqsg
you can matriculate into the school while still in ns (get student card) but you will still start school after ord with the rest of cohort,btohqsg
i think i mixed up early matriculation w/ early admission oops,btohqsg
early admissions is not early matriculation,btohqsg
but yeah this one is right,btohqsg
Its not that far the bus stop to the school,btohqsg
Like you cut under the block is faster,btohqsg
It isnt as bad as it seems its way nearer than one of my prev sec sch,btohqsg
hello  any NUS CS seniors here with SWE track? wanna know your module path!,btohqsg
"Not a CS senior  but you can check outhttps://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cugresource/per-cohort/cs/cs-20-21/  search for the words ""Satisfy at least one CS Focus Area""",btohqsg
Basically the modules in the table are compulsory  except for the CS focus area  which you can choose which modules you wanna take. One of the focus areas is called software enginnering  and you have to clear 3 modules in the Area Primaries  with at least one module at level-4000 or above. The modules are herehttps://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/focus/#SWEngrg. You can also hope onto nus mods to see their prerequesties,btohqsg
is there like a timing hehe,btohqsg
Isnt as bad as it seems,btohqsg

No point getting late coming when you can have a day off,btohqsg
but still need take train then LRT,btohqsg
Bus stop is nearer than LRT stop iirc,btohqsg
Yeah like what the other dude said  bus stop is way nearer,btohqsg
Personal opinion cause if you can easily catch up with studies or have the materials to do so  then it would make sense to fake an mc and keep your conduct in check rather than coming a minute late and being marked as late as someone who comes in the afternoon,btohqsg
but isn't like every school day important in JC?,btohqsg
like you can't afford to miss out on school,btohqsg
Closer to exams  the lessons will start to focus on revision instead of new content,btohqsg
So you might want to skip school to study yourself instead,btohqsg
Adding on to john's statement which is true  there are definitely people who can afford to skip a day or two however those people compensate by either being fast learners or studying by themselves at hone,btohqsg
Its like a cost vs benefit kinda thing you gotta weigh yourself,btohqsg
Like what john said  if it is near exam period where its just revision and you come late  for some it is better to sleep in then study at home,btohqsg
then like what time usually dismiss in JC,btohqsg
After jc2 mid year might as well don’t go school already lol,btohqsg
And sch keeps scolding me for not doing homework=my unnecessary stress,btohqsg
If you choose a messed up combi 5pm without cca. If you choose a standard pcme/bcme its about 1pm or 2?,btohqsg
pcme most days also until 6,btohqsg
so messed up means not pcme and bcme?,btohqsg
some normal combi classes can end damn early,btohqsg
timetable shouldn't be a consideration when choosing combi at all,btohqsg
so I have like a judgement,btohqsg
then school start what time worh,btohqsg
Messed up as in super super unconventional,btohqsg
Typical arts stream probably end at the same time too,btohqsg
What combi are you thinking of taking?,btohqsg
Before covid i think its report at 745 everyday but thursday report at 830(?),btohqsg
Cant remember the late day timing cause when sch resume cause of covid the timetable was,btohqsg
Ima be straight with you thats my combi rn,btohqsg
Some of my classmates had to skip last class to go cca,btohqsg
the only one in your cohort is it,btohqsg
About 7pm or 730 latest for some ccas,btohqsg
If you join sports cca its about that time,btohqsg
What cca are you thinking of,btohqsg
but is it safe to say that CCAs in JC not as on as Secondary school?,btohqsg
My cca is way more slack end early and its once per week,btohqsg
in secondary school JC is a pretty big deal,btohqsg
but in JC is not really a big deal,btohqsg
probably thinking of a really slack CCA,btohqsg
It really depends on if the cca is slack and what you wanna get from cca,btohqsg
If you want achievements portfolio etc you need to put effort,btohqsg
If not then you could skip cca and it wont affect your a level grade although it is highly unadvisable,btohqsg
I heard like there's some CCA like one year 2 times only,btohqsg
All ccas are at least once per week,btohqsg
some geography association or something haha,btohqsg
It could be the model UN cca,btohqsg
But i dont think it is actually only twice per year,btohqsg
Probably their major events are only twice per year,btohqsg
Their membership is single digit i think,btohqsg
I could be very wrong though,btohqsg
nono I don't think is in JPJC,btohqsg
ngl I see the CCAs right,btohqsg
Then i just joined the cca with best percieved portfolio/hour rate,btohqsg
If you have extra time you could come to the open house idk if thats happening though,btohqsg
If im not wrong my sch is planning to do it irl,btohqsg
Also from the moe press release it seems possible,btohqsg
if I have I pm you haha,btohqsg
CCAs are pretty important for building a portfolio,btohqsg
One of the reasons why JC is rather unappealing to me,btohqsg
As the academic commitment is daunting,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionis sgexams gonna do the poly/jc ama like last year?,btohqsg
Plus atop of CCA accomplishments  stuff like external competitions (coding) or community service too,btohqsg
I think we have plans to,btohqsg
I dotn even use chim words in my language and I was in jc  you confirm do well in GP,btohqsg
implying poly academic commitment not daunting,btohqsg
