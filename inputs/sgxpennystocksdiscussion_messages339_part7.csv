i still have Pan United. Didnt sell the last time when it went up to 325. since then  can only suck thumb and patiently wait.,btohqsg
Pan is post covid play.. Very slow counter.. Industrial will be last time recover..,btohqsg
DM looks fierce this year.. Try to hold lor.. Hero or zero,btohqsg
ICG also cement. i think Pan U better lah. US side turning towards industrials  aviation  financial play in the coming months. maybe singapore side will follow.,btohqsg
Pan united pre covid got research abit.. Government say want to step up floor level to counter the rising see level.. Then suddenly covid.. Low trade volume damn sian,btohqsg
I personally feel u luan hoot whatever looks/ sounds good and people intro. After awhile hype over the self doubt creeps in and feel is better to recycle to more hyped counters.Investor turn trader and vice versa.End up the ones that run are usually those u rotate out sometime back then u wonder why,btohqsg
