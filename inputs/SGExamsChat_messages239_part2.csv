I dunno where u get the idea that word count needs to be high,btohqsg

The word count does not matter,btohqsg
What matters is that you answered the question,btohqsg

Seriously  stop focusing on word count,btohqsg
word count is a true nightmare,btohqsg
in JC/sec sch  word count (exceeding it) isn't a problem,btohqsg
If I said you only need write 50 words then you'll strategise to write only 50 words meh LOL,btohqsg

Imagine summarising what you did in a chemistry experiment in 80 words,btohqsg

1) You do enough math papers until you memorise how do (only works for O Levels  but less so now with the application qns)2) You understand what you're doing when you write those equations and stuff,btohqsg
u practice enough  you'll achieve both memorising and understanding,btohqsg
