🎉Pika World Markets Update - 8 Dec 2023🎉It is three cheers for the market. First  the S&P 500 ended its losing streak. Nasdaq recovered from its senile move recently  with the engine roaring as AI-related momentum gained traction. Alphabet casts its magic with the positive response to its generative AI ambition.These were sufficient to keep the market trending higher throughout the session.On the top story  let's wrap up Alphabet as the day's call.🚀AI launch can be risky  given any mistake could cause a massive loss to the company's stocks. This time  Google's Gemini hit the right note with its advanced AI software model receiving praise from analysts. This sent Alphabet's share to rise more than 4% in early Thursday. When Alphabet launched its chatbot  Bard  in February  its market capitalisation dropped by $100 billion as the investment was seen as a flop.Now  we are seeing Google re-branding as a critical player in the AI race. One analyst from JP Morgan sees the Gemini release as a significant innovation breakthrough  giving the stock a price target of $150.🎯So  what's so amazing about this Gemini software? First  it had a score higher than OpenAI's GPT-4 in terms of industry standards for massive multitask language understanding (MMLU). MMLU is critical in combining knowledge from diverse sources  the majority from 57 subjects spending to subjects from math  physics  history  law  medicine  ethics  and many more that one can imagine.According to some analysts  it is also the first to have a model that outperforms human experts.🥁Gemini Ultra is the most powerful version of Alphabet's release and is now being tested for safety. A full launch is expected next year. This is for the enterprise-level customer.Then come the other two versions  Gemini Pro and Gemini Nano  which can be used at another scale level  such as in smartphones  laptops  or other local devices. So imagine having AI capability on the move within your hand's reach. That's a breakthrough.📪What's on the menu today?🗽We have a full agenda tonight. The primary job data  such as Nonfarm Payroll  unemployment rate  and inflation expectation  will all be released from 9.30 pm to 11 pm.Hence  do expect large swings and volatility.It is 8 Dec  Friday  8.55 am in Singapore and 8. 55 pm in New York. We have closed most of our trading positions to reduce our initial exposure as we await today's job data to clarify the labour market. We can have a good trading day to end the week.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
