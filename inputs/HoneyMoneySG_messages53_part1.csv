Hi guys any good bank recommendation for 100 k sgd fixed deposit for this month ? Which bank have good interest rate ?Or better to just park the money in moomoo cash plus ? Thanks,btohqsg

Hi all  can I ask how does CPF determine if you will go for FRS or ERS at age 55? Assuming u have enough for ERS but want to just use the FRS sum.,btohqsg
By default they will shift your funds up to the prevailing FRS at 55  topping up to ERS is optional.,btohqsg
Does it make sense to keep the excessive $$ above FRS at 4% SA instead of ERS?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs up to personal preference. Excess monies staying in SA can be withdrawn out as cash at any point of time after 55 years old. If you choose to transfer into your RA  it cannot be withdrawn out  only meant for monthly payout.,btohqsg
Ok ok thanks for your advice,btohqsg
hi all  for uob prvi 45k miles promotion. i saw milelion mentioning that utilities is excluded but couldnt see this under the t&c. can anyone help to confirm?,btohqsg
FRS is by default  if you want to opt for ERS  you can just top up your RA up to the limit of ERS. Once u top up  it will not be withdrawabale. Only those in your OA and SA an be withdrawn anytime,btohqsg
Yup that‚Äôs what I said  if you transfer your SA/OA to your RA  it will not be withdrawable and only for monthly payout,btohqsg
sure. but what i had copied is specifically for the miles promotion though,btohqsg
Then you need to call UOB to clarify.,btohqsg
