So the district filter is more like central ish orders ?,btohqsg
Yest I deliver 2 routes lol,btohqsg
Last guy got his food at 8pm,btohqsg
You have to travel super far to earn abit more..,btohqsg
You as a rider can take muti stops also to earn,btohqsg
Yes the distance is far but less time consuming,btohqsg
12 base plus 3 holiday 15,btohqsg
I dunno how to choose and stack orders yet haha,btohqsg
Every km 0.45 lol west to east 20 plus,btohqsg
Try not to stack  unless really necessary,btohqsg
I might as well do nearbys,btohqsg
Depends on how u plan ur route. Usually I look for same area pickup or drop off,btohqsg
I whack further distance to compensate my bus/mrt fares,btohqsg
Or 2nd one at my 1st drop off,btohqsg
See the drop off faster take alr,btohqsg
But depend on luck n if u do full time u know where to wait for orders,btohqsg
I onli do when I'm free or going ofc or bk hm so my location limited,btohqsg
AVG 40 to 60 a day the most,btohqsg
I average 80 to $100 a day,btohqsg
Trying to see if can make it full time. I planning to take leave to simulate a full day of lalamove. At least my goal is $100 a day and see how long on average to earn it,btohqsg
Looks like upgrading to 2A bike is not possible cus lalamove seem to be able to take up 100km a day and 2A bike mileage is really not economic enough,btohqsg
It really depends on how you take the orders tbh,btohqsg
2a is heavier right if I not wrong ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
The best is start little India there always got order,btohqsg
I hate to talk to the staff there ðŸ˜ª,btohqsg
Not just that. Engine bigger means less mileage. 1 liter gas will use more km,btohqsg
Not really trying to offense anyone,btohqsg
100 is ez la. It's economical if ur transport is cos that's where the cost come,btohqsg
I am picky with my orders I dun do cbds,btohqsg
N my car FC is 10kmpl. So every L after discount is 2 bucks,btohqsg
Hence not worth for mi to pick long distance,btohqsg
I prefer sending food to hdbs.,btohqsg
No need trolley no need guards lol,btohqsg
Okay ma.. also not as bad,btohqsg
Wow car seem really rough with that mileage,btohqsg
I also got read this article. Fine is up to 2k. Maybe 1st time offender might be a few hundreds. 2k must be a repeated offender i guess..,btohqsg
Yea so not full time but when I go out or when gd nearby orders come in,btohqsg
So it mainly cover my petrol like grabhitch,btohqsg
But at least I dun need to deal with human,btohqsg
Ya True.. better then handling actual customers ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Lol they think I'm juz a grab driver,btohqsg
Expects mi to go their route,btohqsg
8am cck wan rch Chinatown at 830,btohqsg
I Don even eat inside grab sia out of respect,btohqsg
Then realise non know hitch is driving their own car,btohqsg
share the customer that cancel u here so we wont take its order,btohqsg
Gave up . Mental health got better ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Regardless of rental or own car still have to respect uh,btohqsg
Guess the covid virus and safe entry thing is back,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ your own health matters bro ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
