Hi Melvyn  can I ask if rotate  it should be on 1st of every month?,btohqsg
Hi! Its possible. You can try adding more accounts from thislink. It'll direct you to the main accounts page on the app,btohqsg
Best to check the t&c of the incoming bank on what fresh funds means to them first.,btohqsg
Fresh funds means new funds. It is not within their incoming bank. New funds,btohqsg
Any good use of dcs cc? I don't seem to see any reviews.,btohqsg
I saw their ultimate platinum cc with 2% cashback.,btohqsg
Can we link cc to Alipay and use it to pay hawker sgqr to earn cashback?,btohqsg
The shengsiong one seems good tho provided your usual spending is at shengsiong,btohqsg
I have the vicom card. Seems no use at all.,btohqsg
Thank you for your English lesson,btohqsg
I read a page and they only say “Link your preferred eligible card or bank account  including Visa  Mastercard and Diners Club cards  to start spending.”,btohqsg
Hi guys  a question regarding GIRO.If the GIRO deduction date falls on either a Saturday  Sunday or PH  does the deduction take place on the next business day (and not any earlier date)?,btohqsg
Usually it’s the next working day   you can check the tnc of the giro arrangement for more details,btohqsg
I think will continue with GrabPay ba,btohqsg
What benefits are there for grabpay,btohqsg
Being cashless is a benefit 🤣,btohqsg
GrabPay need top-up min $10 and gets stuck there if you don't spend at least $10 🤪 but seems fine if you use often at hawker with GrabPay I guess.,btohqsg
It’s true  but I always use GrabPay for hawker so top up when needed haha. The balance there is always very minimal for example less than $10. I used it to pay education fees also. So I always get 1.3% cashback from it. 0.3% from UOB  and 1% from HSBC.,btohqsg
True but grabpay often has a lot of like orphan money inside  like the cents actually pile up,btohqsg
As long not for Grab rides or food will do,btohqsg
Actually if you seek help from their support  money can be transferred to your bank. I tried once successfully. That time I trying to pay insurance but failed  so my sum of money is stuck there. I contacted their support for help haha.,btohqsg
Purely for paynow QR scan payment. I know why you say that haha. Those rides and food can use card for better cashback.,btohqsg
That's why I don't like grab pay,btohqsg
GrabPay still allow me a 1.3% cashback for paynow payment. I can’t find any other since XNAP is down.. AMEX I don’t have though.,btohqsg
Not everyone as lucky as you. I see cases where people request for refund and they don't get it back after months.,btohqsg
I wonder Amex scan can pay for UEN? And still get cashback?,btohqsg
If you scrolled up and read  xGSx have explained how.,btohqsg
only for those sgqr going through nets gateway,btohqsg
I used to keep transferring to grab wallet when Google pay gives cashback just by topping up,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing your opinion. Appreciate it a lot,btohqsg
Bro. Don't use any top up. You won't get any miles.,btohqsg
I absolutely stopped using grab in general. Used to be first tester for grab debit and paylater. Since then the nerf is worse and worse. I understand they wanna promote their usage of wallet but 😓,btohqsg
Which part of “used to” don’t you understand? And I am topping up using Gpay. And not everything is about miles or hotel points  I get cashback just by topping up. So maybe you can read the whole message thanks,btohqsg
Well they launch it not long after Uber was gone  so the market was pretty monopolised by them. Now even the grab card is gone,btohqsg
I wanted to stop GrabPay also.. if I can find alternative to pay sgqr + paynow UEN.,btohqsg
Any referral code for sign up Changi App?,btohqsg
@sgpromocodeif have then have  don't have then don't have.,btohqsg
Have to see if xnap comes back by this year,btohqsg
My old time fav. But now I use it only for the cny event haha,btohqsg
Yeaa but it’s once a year thing and minimal effort,btohqsg
If guaranteed to get still ok  but now almost no guarantees,btohqsg
I think it is gone. Most probably won't be back,btohqsg
@clowninwithsalmonpsychic has given his reading... I have lesser faith in xnap now 🥲,btohqsg
Sorry  didn’t know you know the future. Someone sent an email in before and xnap replied they are working on smth. So it’s not a guaranteed gone for good. If it is  why not they just say it won’t be coming back.That being said  things might still happen and it may not come back,btohqsg
