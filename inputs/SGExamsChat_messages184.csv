they may test on like a issue,btohqsg
but the sources cover diff parts of the world,btohqsg
it might b like 2018 2019 sbq,btohqsg
So what do y’all reckon the SRQ tomorrow will be,btohqsg
hi for this when they say i must sit for this exam  does this mean i need to pass also or as long as i sit for it it's fine?,btohqsg
"So if it were called ""east asian flu"" it wont be interpreted as implicitly accusatory?",btohqsg
I would say so  given that it would be regional and not sovereign based,btohqsg
China has enough landmass to be considered a region though,btohqsg
"Plus in the case of the spanish flu  though it was a misnomer  it points directly to a nation.So would it be okay to name a flu that started in another country as the ""chinese flu""?",btohqsg
Keep in mind  spain has way more reason to be pissed. It had a flu named after it even though it never originated in it,btohqsg
"I would say given the shifting culture and globalisation of the 21st century  the concept of naming is much more delicate compared to linguistical developments.Note that spain has actively protested against the name ""spanish flu"" and the general culture of lack of globalisation or intolerance during the 1910s.For a repeat and parallel of that in the 2020s would therefore be ridiculous",btohqsg
But that would be self contradictory  because china by itself is a sovereign legal entity. I dont think borders and regionality- a reference to the continent  is meant to interchangeable,btohqsg
Negative. Id say that with the developments in science and globalisation  the priority has shifted away from petty naming squabbles to actual containment and medicinal research.The first priority should have been to find a cure  rather than use the disease as political ammunition in global agencies.The unnecessary dispute in terminology has forced scientists to repeatedly reauthor their research papers and fractured the international community along political lines,btohqsg
Petty would therefore be subjective. Where is your basis in claiming that? The whole idea of respect is that one cannot take a subjective claim into a claim that is subjectively put to moot by another party,btohqsg
Do you put naming disputes above the preservation of human lives?,btohqsg
given the context that Trump has a prima facie hostility against china and that he was on active advocacy to call it the chinese flu  one can see the principle that one is entitled to defend or retaliate to hostilities in a reasonable way.,btohqsg
thats a fallacy because you are assuming what i am saying therefore i am not answering that.,btohqsg
you assumed that the priority of saving lives have being neglected by naming disputes  when there is no quantifiable evidence that because of the naming disputes  lives have being lost.,btohqsg
Would any sane global entity (let alone one of the greatest growing powers in the world) hinder global scientific and containment efforts because of a naming dispute?,btohqsg
A waste of time isnt it?,btohqsg
there is no evidence  that because of naming disputes  global scientific and containment efforts have being hindered,btohqsg
and therefore  it is an uncalled assumption,btohqsg
Beyond the scientific community  it has also cause misinformation amongst the general population. How do you expect the general public to keep up with the rapid name changes? How would they keep abreast of the disease if it were called one name today and another name tomorrow? All because of a petty politiking,btohqsg
in which I would say that is a very  very possible but one of hardly any significance. Name change hardly implies that the distribution of information would be affected. WHO has changed the names multiple times and no one has criticised that. You are once again committing circular reasoning because your of whole presumption of a subjective goal of a nation is not meant to be significant,btohqsg
a possibility of an existence does not give weight to probability and significance,btohqsg
"So how is the general public supposed to follow guidelines and advices promulgated by their governments and health ministries if they are not even aware of what the disease is called? Especially in countries where enforcement is weak and the public relies on information from news channels and newspapers? What about the illiterate who can only listen to auditory guidelines? These forms a large proportion of the global population  FYI. And they are one of the most vulnerable groups too.Okay fine. Lets talk it through. What does china  one of the rising superpowers of the world have to lose if its called the chinese flu? A bit of international prestige? A slap on the wrist by international agencies? Loss of allies (tightly bound by the ""belt and road initiative"")? China faces 0 threat to its sovereignty. Whats other countries gonna do? Declare war? Never. Aint happening.On the other hand  think of how many lives are lost in developing countries because of the petty acts of that great nation",btohqsg
People have criticised it. Else this argument wont be happening right now haha. People criticised the slow response and unnecessary renamings of the virus by WHO,btohqsg
"1. I think that is a major assumption to say that unawareness will come from different name changes. At this point  it is actually a safe assumption that most countries will know that the ongoing pandemic is known as ""covid""  and if one day it would be called bazinga flu everyone will still know what pandemic we are talking about- due to the prevalence. The extremely niche examples you are giving is being shoehorned to being a representative of the general population on a proportion scale.2. I think you do not have a right understanding of international law. No matter how insignificant a ""threat"" is to a country  they are entitled to retaliate as long as it is reasonable- doesnt have to be a use of force- as long as it is proportionate. This is based on the UN charter 1 and 7. Just because there is no ""quantifiable"" damage doesnt mean that a country should "" suck it up"".3. well  is there any evidence of that? any correlation?",btohqsg
"many people have criticised the chinese for causing the virus  and people have criticised trump for having call it ""chinese flu"". A criticism while valid  does not give weight to it by itself. My point while lie corrected  is also moot by itself.",btohqsg
1. Perhaps it is now. But keep in mind that the name changes were occurring as COVID was just beginning to spread across the world. Guidelines changed frequently and those in developing nations were not getting information as quickly. Take into account the fact that the name had to be translated to many different languages. Perhaps if the name hasnt been changed so many times  developing countries might have been able to react?And lets be clear here. A single life lost due to this renaming is a life too many.2. Of course countries are entitled to do many petty things  but a responsible country should consider its reaction and its potential global impact. Now perhaps some official high up in the opaque ruling party has decided that a bit of prestige is worth inconveniencing the world and slowing the global scientific advance against the virus. Legal? Yeah. Is china acting like the power that it is going to be? Definitely not.,btohqsg
and to point 3  studies have not been done because the effects and numbers can and should only be done in the aftermath of this virus  so the overall impact can be assessed properly. But again. A single life is too much for political ambition,btohqsg
"1. That so  but the argument you have put forth was that the chinese reaction to the name "" chinese flu"" is unjustified  when the chinese are requesting the official name given by WHO (COVID19)- who has condemned naming of pandemics that are based on geographical locations  while Trump has evidentially went out of the way ( cancelling ""corona"" and writing china in his speech) to call it the chinese virus. If your argument applied  wouldnt it therefore  be America's problem and not the chinese reaction?2. My point above. China being blamed for reacting to an active  positive act of political aggression is kinda... sino-phobic3. thats an extremist view  bordering on the line on purely theoratical and utopian. I think its best that I do not address that as it is while idealistic and concedingly a benchmark to work for  it is impractical.",btohqsg
"the other hand also is valid. Trump's naming of the chinese virus has caused documented cases of racism against asian americans and chinese. Actual violence and discrimination occured due to the connotation that the ""chinese"" caused the virus- wouldnt it therefore flow from your logic  that in justifying the use of COVID19 and not ""chinese"" flu  that China is effectively preventing said abuse and assualt?",btohqsg
1. Chinese requested the amendment before trump had gave his speech. So who initiated it? Who wanted to dissociate itself from the virus that originated from its lands?2. Well  you could consider that trump  as a responsible and capable leader who understands the american public  knows that the virus is most well known amongst the population as the chinese/wuhan virus. He is simply taking a pragmatic approach by calling it as what it is best known as in his country  in order to best inform the american public.3. Human life is above all. If a single person has died because of chinese politiking  the chinese communist party has blood on its hands. Especially if the party has considered the possibility and international impact  then it has committed intentional murder. If it HASNT considered this possibility  then its ranks are filled with politicians that lack foresight.,btohqsg
People on the streets were already calling the virus the wuhan/chinese virus before trump said it himself. Trump simply used the name that it is best known by. Prejudice amongst the american public would already have had taken root,btohqsg
i think its ok  it wasnt personal  william is a trump supporter that is against china  there is nothing inherently wrong with that as its an opinion ( which i disagreed with),btohqsg
Tho i touch news very less,btohqsg
But the way he handle covid kind of makes be suspect that he isn't doing it right,btohqsg
And blaming it came from china,btohqsg
try being a president of a country that has to handle 350million idiots who go for george floyd protests without masks and destroys infrastructures.,btohqsg
take away trump's racism comments  lgbt hate etc. he will be one of the greatest president since obama's rulings,btohqsg
that i agree  just because he is different doesnt mean he is bad by itself,btohqsg
why get so offended by a fat dude comments  just close your ears and enjoy the benefits that he has made  10 million more jobs and economy  lesser homeless people on streets,btohqsg
"everyone just hated trump because ""other people hate him too"" have your own voice and opinion  don't follow suit",btohqsg
I'd say Obama helped america recover economically while trump brought the country to new heights,btohqsg
i mean his geopolitical aggression towards china is uncalled for  but i dont deny the economic re-vitalisation he has done,btohqsg
both are instrumental to where america is at right now,btohqsg
also trump is a president who speaks the truth directly and ruthlessly  i rather have my president tell me the truth then have obama sugar coat everything,btohqsg
biden got nothing on trump  the only thing he can do is minimize border security to allow for easier immigration  allow lgbt couples to marry publicly and allow abortions. thats all.,btohqsg
"REEE ""WiLl YoU sHuT uP mAn""/s",btohqsg
oh  then us gonna get nuked and bullied by north korea and china,btohqsg
check your pm- the murder part has defo triggered my nilly willy billy,btohqsg
i for one welcome our chinese overlords. RMB goes BRRR,btohqsg
hello can someone tell me which topics I shld focus on for ss tmr,btohqsg
don't let that 8 mark essay bother you  memorise format now first and know how to get higher level. then speed run textbook,btohqsg
Ss so ez to score tho,btohqsg
Comb and pure not much diff,btohqsg
Not much diff now pure also no organic chem hahaa,btohqsg
No ? I actually from purest,btohqsg
all jews boil at same temperature?,btohqsg
only one way to find out said hitler,btohqsg
anyone memorised all 3 issues for ss?,btohqsg
Quick qns  is there leniency for marking for subs like English  SS etc?,btohqsg
nah not even one i gg 😔,btohqsg
Must we memorise the different healthcare systems?,btohqsg
on the dot think cn alr just read thru so uk roughly what it is about,btohqsg
ngl u nvr know abt seab HAHA,btohqsg
some of them are literally jus common sense bro HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
im still stuck at chapter 1 of issue 3,btohqsg
the more likely chapter that i think will come out,btohqsg
my brain capacity is at its finest alr,btohqsg
2018 they did healthcare so they most likely not gonna repeat healthcare,btohqsg
just read thrueveryth dunnid memorise la,btohqsg
heslthcare also cn on the dot think one,btohqsg
What do u think will come out tmr,btohqsg
idk man thrs SOOO many to choose from,btohqsg
It's still 10 chapters. Will take quite a while to read,btohqsg
i just like read den understand then u cn cm up w the same peel one most of the time,btohqsg
the examples r the reason why i dropped geog,btohqsg
issue 3 study until whr ah,btohqsg
i know the cyber or smth one is out of syllabus this yr,btohqsg
i haven started on geog yet,btohqsg
so stop at issue 3 chapter 10?,btohqsg
or chap 9 of issue 3,btohqsg
i have 2 papers a day for 2 days,btohqsg
poa paper 2 with physics paper 2,btohqsg
now im likejcjenz alot to chunk,btohqsg
Honestly O levels make me rethink going to JC lol,btohqsg
i hate ionic eqns and seperation methods when they ask u write all the steps,btohqsg
beryllium loses 2 electrons to form +ve chafge,btohqsg
but the number infront diff isit,btohqsg
ionic becomes easy if u practice,btohqsg
gain 2 electron forms negative charge,btohqsg
its only for non metals for this,btohqsg
Depends.. if it’s molten  it’s (l),btohqsg
so its EXAMPLE if Be is uhm need gain 2 electrons okayisitBe (s) -> BE^2- (aq) + 2e-,btohqsg
its like Cl2 (g) + 2e = 2Cl- (depends),btohqsg
How do I know you gave eg?,btohqsg
Chapter 10 don’t need study btw,btohqsg
i think its some cyber security isues,btohqsg
for chem when must write state symbols,btohqsg
Pure learn a little bit more,btohqsg
However qn asked would be completely different as compared to com sci,btohqsg
or have done chem olympiad in jc 🙏🏼,btohqsg
but idk wat they will test,btohqsg
This wed physical chem only rite,btohqsg
uk the format besides it being 2 hours???,btohqsg
i have a level chinese tmr and i dont eben bother studying,btohqsg
yea idk why my parents take it so srs,btohqsg
It can increase the rp by a few decimal poont,btohqsg
but if u do pretty well in ur h2s and h1 it would be insignificant rite,btohqsg
True. It will only increase by 0.25,btohqsg
But if u want Ur cert,btohqsg
But my Chinese level is well  not the best,btohqsg
aiya wtv la  its just chinese  probably the last time i need to write a single chi word,btohqsg
for SS just remember the examples for citizenship and governance,btohqsg
The rest of SRQ is fairly simple,btohqsg
Just pray you don’t choke during the paper,btohqsg
havent finish ss but id feel like continuing 😐,btohqsg
heard it will be way worse,btohqsg
And then the IP people can just cake walk to a levels,btohqsg
It is closer to a levels,btohqsg
Evenly distributed over the 2 years,btohqsg
It’s the equivalent of experiencing o levels for 2 full years,btohqsg
But poly means i hv time to work and earn some moolah,btohqsg
Polytechnic is not difficult if your discipline I heard,btohqsg
But your GPA must be insane,btohqsg
but then i want to go uni and i heard its really hard,btohqsg
Aiya anywhr aft sec sch will be difficult,btohqsg
Thats why i want to go to np,btohqsg
Or sp but they dh the course i want,btohqsg
Top 10 percentile of your course then can already,btohqsg
But that usually equates to a GPA of 3.5+,btohqsg
Mess up one semester and there goes your chances of a stellar GPA,btohqsg
So the question is do i prefer to suffer somewhat for 3 years or go through hell for half a year,btohqsg
Only easy way out is ITE,btohqsg
I heard ite damn competitive also,btohqsg
Become valedictorian of ITE  win a president’s scholarship that’ll carry you through polytechnic and then to university,btohqsg
My friend who slacked through n levels,btohqsg
but the problem with ite is that its such a long journey,btohqsg
Got 21 at n levels I think,btohqsg
i mean even from poly u go uni also not easy also,btohqsg
that’s the type of standard that’s existent there,btohqsg
most of the poly ppl i know so far in my course are struggling,btohqsg
I heard u can go to australian uni with o level results lol,btohqsg
So the JC people perform better in university,btohqsg
i have no money so i cant do Australia lol,btohqsg
I heard the polytechnic people generally perform better,btohqsg
yalls the qualifying statements only like that ritesince source a supports source b  source b is trustedsince source a supports source b  source b is reliable and usefulsince source a supports source b  source b is reliablesince source a supports source b  i am not surprised by source bsince source a supports source b  source b proves that......,btohqsg
maybe for practical/hands on mods they fare better,btohqsg
The ones that make it to university,btohqsg
i heard so too before joinin uni,btohqsg
but from what i see so far  its not rly true,btohqsg
im genuinely not interested in most jc topics thou,btohqsg
Maybe that’s because your in an early year?,btohqsg
but dont let this discourage u from going uni,btohqsg
So you have yet to learn the deeper topics,btohqsg
cos poly students also havent learn the deeper topics yet,btohqsg
Frankly I’ll only go to a really good JC,btohqsg
any third tier ones are out of the question,btohqsg
basically bottom line is imo there's a bias towards jc students faring better overall,btohqsg
Because you’ll have to defeat the odds there,btohqsg
i was technically from a third-tier jc,btohqsg
That’s why I’ll probably go to polytechnic,btohqsg
Im gonna do much worse for os than prelims lol,btohqsg
I want to get 80+ RP if I go JC,btohqsg
Which is not gonna be feasible in third tier,btohqsg
so i dont get what u are saying,btohqsg
Why didn’t you go overseas to study?,btohqsg
plus local unis are paying me to study,btohqsg
90RP shouldn’t be too difficult to get one right,btohqsg
should be an instant get if u apply local,btohqsg
Does it affect my a level RP?,btohqsg
Ok then I actually have a chance,btohqsg
Huh then take chinese in jc for what?,btohqsg
it does if u are going for a MT related course and ur chinese is better than the next best subject,btohqsg
oh yeah shit have to take chinese in as,btohqsg
And his stupid belief that all should learn a second language,btohqsg
Mfw i looking for internships but not many available for BME,btohqsg
i dont think it should be abolished,btohqsg
Don’t tell me you fan boy LKY,btohqsg
Ye but I think students should be given an option,btohqsg
i think ive come to the wrong chat at wrong time,btohqsg
but i feel that certain things are in place for a reason,btohqsg
To decide which second language they take,btohqsg
We alr been bilingual for 10 to 11 years,btohqsg
but nobody will take it then,btohqsg
u will know why certain things are as such,btohqsg
You can choose  but you must have one,btohqsg
ahh right right and not just mother tongue,btohqsg
mother tongue is still impt tbh,btohqsg
does anyone know a thing or two abt alcohol bitters?,btohqsg
the funny thing is i have malay friends who take chinese  so i think u can actually choose ur mother tongue? to a certain extent,btohqsg
like what? theres orange bitters blah blah blah,btohqsg
I not even sure if i gg w bme anymor looking at 0 internships abailable,btohqsg
Were you the top scorer in your JC?,btohqsg
Its for diff kind of drinks,btohqsg
How is it possible to get higher than 90RP?,btohqsg
But gets toned down to 90,btohqsg
oh if i wanna make a drink i must get ___ bitter,btohqsg
which cant be used for another drink,btohqsg
they look at number of distinctions?,btohqsg
Its a prerequisite for certain drinks,btohqsg
my school highest was 7  including MT,btohqsg
So it doesn’t account for mother tongue,btohqsg
No la my tuition they set like o level,btohqsg
V suspicious looking link  please say what’s inside before you post it next time,btohqsg
wht time yalls need rch sch tmr,btohqsg
i alr hv a issue rchin sch 730,btohqsg
I’m for real scared for O levels,btohqsg
Just read this horror story on reddit,btohqsg
I have to reach by 6:30,btohqsg
Person scoring B4-A2 for English scored C6 at o levels,btohqsg
Dont need to make us depressed too lol,btohqsg
I’m so scared about reading that story,btohqsg
What if it happens to one of us,btohqsg
Gonna need tutors and all that,btohqsg
I’m scared after reading that story,btohqsg
im probabaly go thru my whole srq again den sleep 🥱,btohqsg
Maybe his school mark too lenient,btohqsg
Oh my god later bell curve 95,btohqsg
I feel like my school marks too lenient tbh,btohqsg
The English bellcurve cannot be so high bruh,btohqsg
If 95 almost no one can get,btohqsg
Ya I think I got 90% at most for e math,btohqsg
Damn olvl kids every yr the same,btohqsg
He probably meant the person who said he sucked but end up scoring A,btohqsg
I think he saying that although u say u are screwed you will get single digit l1r5,btohqsg
Idt u will understand the joke unless uve been in this grp since 2019,btohqsg
He is saying we are all screwed for Os,btohqsg
That is a very colourful interpretation,btohqsg
But Neil what do you mean??,btohqsg
time to move to the other education grp,btohqsg
To spare you the suspense  he means that every year will have people panicking for no good reason,btohqsg
I haven’t been in this group long enough,btohqsg
But no need to give them attention here,btohqsg
Sounds like someone who’s downloaded sgsecure,btohqsg
Ok I think I get it now,btohqsg
I am just doing my job of crime prevention,btohqsg
Precisely why i said “no wtf”,btohqsg
I focused on the wrong thing,btohqsg
i think we have yet to see both sides,btohqsg
maybe he behaves 720degrees differently in sch,btohqsg
but im not casting 0 doubts on his chers,btohqsg
If u r really concerned then maybe u can try to meet the Teachers,btohqsg
his chers sound bad based on his account,btohqsg
If u r just moderately concerned then maybe u just email principal,btohqsg
but i believe this is pri sch,btohqsg
Cause principal probably wouldn’t want to escalate matters to MOE  thus u have more leverage in the situation,btohqsg
pri sch teachers in general are hmmm... interesting,btohqsg
usually pri sch teachers in general (my own experience) are bad,btohqsg
that being said  the ultimate bad teachers  actually (not all)  are beyond the reaches of MOE,btohqsg
Or can ask ur MP to write to MOE or something,btohqsg
MPs hold meet the people sessions weekly,btohqsg
The specific area hes in charge of,btohqsg
maybe u take pic next time,btohqsg
But i was afk on duty,btohqsg
Can we not politicise the classroom,btohqsg
4. Pester MP5. Write to Straits times6. Post on reddit,btohqsg
gonna look forward to reading nusconfessions tmr then,btohqsg
Sad that you got small spaces and lim Tean to contest in ur area lol,btohqsg
i mean if u send now,btohqsg
LOL he keep on flaming jo teo but never got pofma,btohqsg
Was quite surprised he could get even more votes than WP in 2015,btohqsg
Probably have a lot of verbal insults,btohqsg
I guess if wp sent a good team to Jalan Besar they’d prolly get more votes than lim tean,btohqsg
Then  can say goodbye to jo,btohqsg
Pv only got like 35% of the vote cos I think generally people don’t trust them,btohqsg
I also feel that quite a number of my friends trust parties like WP but as for parties PV they won’t vote for them,btohqsg
I also disagreed with the sia environmental tax but i guess it’s great WP won more seats,btohqsg
calvin cheng is the definition of a bootlicker 😂,btohqsg
Maybe I’m thinking their talking about using tax to internalise the cost of pollution but I guess not much point,btohqsg
Aren't they alr planning to do that,btohqsg
One of the failures produced by the nmp scheme IMO,btohqsg
At least the nmp scheme also got good people like anthea ong,btohqsg
not that easy to just like..... overnight change every single thing,btohqsg
the only thing worse than continually churning out shitty policies is praising shitty policies that he isnt even good enough to come up with ahaha,btohqsg
Yeah she and a group of other nmps tried to be useful and did stuff like suggesting amendments for pofma so I guess their efforts must be applauded,btohqsg
She also questioned jo Teo on the foreign worker,btohqsg
the tax  alongside some grants  are to encourage firms to r&d better tech to emit less,btohqsg
And by doing so exposed the true colours of j teo,btohqsg
Hey everyone! I'm dropping this msg here to let y'all know that I'm running this Telegram channel @/huhgotthisthingahwhere I have been sharing GP sample essays (and sometimes AQ) and recommended content to consume. If you'd like to recommend content or share your own essays  the details are in the channel's description. All the best to everyone studying for GP and/or your others subjects! This might help those taking English in sec sch as well :-),btohqsg
Bro   if I sine inverse 1 for basic angle( sine a= 1) then what are my quadrant?,btohqsg
Help me for cosine and tan too,btohqsg
For sine cos and tangent there’s this thing called principal values  which is basically the values u get when u take inverse,btohqsg
So for sine the principal range is from -pi/2 to pi/2 so when u take sin inverse of 1 you’ll get pi/2,btohqsg
The principal range for cos inverse is 0 to pi and for tan inverse it’s -pi/2 to pi/2,btohqsg
Hand break before i write finish,btohqsg
Who wants play 🏀 after exams?,btohqsg
I CAN STILL TAKE THE EXAM IF IM LATE,btohqsg
I believe you get the remainder of the duration of the paper,btohqsg
but can lah hor i gna break my fingers during the paper alr,btohqsg
From what I understand it depends how late you are,btohqsg
Because some people may choose to leave the exam hall early,btohqsg
I don’t think you can do that in national exams,btohqsg
No u cant leave early hahaha,btohqsg
Things would be very noisy and chaotic if u could,btohqsg
Of course singaporean kiasu dont want lose out to leave early,btohqsg
Must stay for the full duration,btohqsg
Which sch are these “some sch”,btohqsg
So my exam got extended to 30 min long. For Math P1.So when the time ended 2.30 to 4.30.I ask my teacher if i can leave now. SHe say ok  so i leave lor.So when i about to leave the sch  the invigilator told me to come back,btohqsg
Then i have to write a report to SEAB,btohqsg
My paper supposed to end at 5.,btohqsg
Math fail nvm i see my phone timing 7:45 i still can tell myself got one more hour to go before paper start,btohqsg
ppl 8am start paper i 8am leave hse,btohqsg
i oni wrote 1 source lol,btohqsg
Bruh wtf today’s sbq was on minimum wage and there was even an extract on Jo teo loll,btohqsg
like what were the chances that what we were discussing on MW and jo teo would come out,btohqsg
when ah chan comes out too,btohqsg
i can book a court in kallang,btohqsg
so everyone will be sheltered just like some people lives,btohqsg
I’m not very good just warning you,btohqsg
Haven’t played in like 2 years,btohqsg
So shouldn’t be too hard to elab,btohqsg
Eh who here didn’t finish the SS paper,btohqsg

I think A1 only need like 74%,btohqsg
So don’t give up yet lol,btohqsg
There’s some people they didn’t do srq at all in the end got A1,btohqsg
I didn't elaborate qn 6 and I didn't finish 7 too,btohqsg
No i never got A1 for humanities,btohqsg
No i mean it fr i am going to fail,btohqsg
Anyone didn't do qn 7 and have no time to finish qn5 :(,btohqsg
I kinda scared i got circular reasoning,btohqsg
How many paragraphs do u need for the 7 marks qn,btohqsg
I contemplated my life choices after it,btohqsg
Well fuck the 3rd para is how many marks? 1 rite,btohqsg
Humans A1 bar is always low,btohqsg
Did what yall predicted came out,btohqsg
Ive seen ppl damn bad at humans get A so dun worry u never know,btohqsg
