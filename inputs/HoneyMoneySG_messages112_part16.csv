Coz amaze ma  bank issued cards don’t think any of it shows,btohqsg
Link your HSBC card to the card maximiser in Heymax  it will show the MCC of your transactions.,btohqsg
Actually I dont understand why the need to cancel a card that gives 4mpd and no annual fee. It can always act as a backup when you burst your other cards max spend. Or just use it on platforms that confirm gives bonus pointsGiven that you don’t have over 100 cards,btohqsg
Because it doesn’t give the 10x points,btohqsg
I think the mcc is still based on what heymax shows  may not be accurate,btohqsg
You mean like actually verify my revo card on hey max?,btohqsg
That makes 0 sense but sure,btohqsg
It’s accurate. The transaction data is provided by Visa  after you have spent.,btohqsg
Read up above when I started the thread,btohqsg
Ya but you can use it on platforms that confirm gives you 10x points? I’m assuming you don’t have other cards to use for dining since you’re using revo,btohqsg
Firstly  try to reconcile your base point for the eligible transactions.Eligible transaction exclude 5411 5814 and 4722 and 7011 that most people think it shall be included but exclude from 01 May onwards. Those are small food stall/fairprice/trip.com/agoda  Cold Storage  Starbucks  KFC  Sheng Siong  etc…Base point is calculated base on your spend on statement month using round down method per transaction.Eg. $1.3 earn 1 point.$1.8 earn 2 points.Check if your base point printed on statement correct or not.I use the above method  it works for my base point but I don’t have many transactions on my Revo card.,btohqsg
Then you can see details of your transactions like this,btohqsg
But is this mcc code based on heymax or based on the actual code of the organisation,btohqsg
Tally your base point first. Bonus point will come 1 or 2 months later.,btohqsg
So I need to pay via heymax?,btohqsg
No need  just link your card and spend. Each time a transaction is completed  it willshow up on Heymax.,btohqsg
That’s my confusion here too cause I only got my card in April and got around 4000+ pts on spend between 800-900This means that bonus points was included within the same statement month,btohqsg
You link then you will know. It is free service and auto get the data from Visa.,btohqsg
bonus points only come in end of next month ah,btohqsg
I guess the 4000+ points are your based points plus part of your bonus points. The rest of your bonus point will appear by end of this month June.If you want to reconcile Revo points  it is not an easy job.,btohqsg
For uobone card  is the sup card and main card on a separate monthly statement?,btohqsg
Points adjusted is your bonus points.,btohqsg
The points earned is inclusive of the bonus points or just the base,btohqsg
Yalo so I got it on the same statement month for April not next month,btohqsg
Ya. That is what I suspect part of your bonus points were credited.,btohqsg
Did you see miscellaneous - bonus under rewards on 28 May in the app? That would be bonus for April spending. If you don’t see  then maybe it’s delayed and should come in June.,btohqsg
Double check with month of May too. No miscellaneous,btohqsg
Just wait till end of June  then check again. Also  go and tally your transactions.,btohqsg
Overall revo is still reliable and consistent if spending of tech and gadget items right?,btohqsg
Tech and gadget from where? Ultimately the MCCs must fall in the whitelist.,btohqsg
Means you have bonus point for the $400 of eligible spending in Apr was  credited.,btohqsg
MCC 5732 still earns 4mpd for Revo.,btohqsg
as a student should i get a student credit card  or should i wait till im earning more and then get a proper one.,btohqsg
Ok will tally up and see if next month have anot . Thanks all for help and insight,btohqsg
Hi  question regarding citi payall. Does the service fee itself earn miles too?,btohqsg
Tbh  it really depends on yourself1) Will you overspend if you do have a credit card( since you won’t see the money in your bank going down like how a debit card works)2) let’s say you do spend recklessly till you hit the limit of card  do you have the means to pay it off without compromising?What I did is whenever I spend on my credit card  I xfer this amount to another bank account. So this helps me keep track of my spending and if really my bank account is depleted  I would still have the means to pay off my card bills.,btohqsg
ya that was my plan too  but i saw somewhere correct me if im wrong that if i apply for a student credit card in the future  ill miss out on “first time credit card holder deals” when i eventually get a real one.,btohqsg
I think it is good to start with a student cc to know your spending habit as it tend to be low limit rather then in future when they gauge based on your income. A high cc limit mean u land into bigger trouble when u cant repay,btohqsg
It probably do  but when you start working  you can always cancel this student card and apply for a new one either under another bank or wait for a year to “reset” since this student card probably have a low limit,btohqsg
Hello  can I ask: Which card should I use to pay my hotel in bangkok?HSBC -Revo  DBS altitude or Amex Krisflyer?,btohqsg
Check out what mcc the hotel is using? If its in exlusion  hsbc revo is out of question. Dbs altitude mayb better option cuz 2.2mpd vs 2mpd,btohqsg
Erm I have the card since 2019. It was some watch. But that one long thrown away  looks metallic but actually is cheap plastic haha,btohqsg
When you plan to put 150K back? 2nd July? I withdraw on 1st Jun,btohqsg
