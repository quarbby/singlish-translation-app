yes of course. its just there for you so you no need key everything again if want to proceed,btohqsg
Doesn't work  what you can do is add a Redemption nominee to the account where you want to redeem krisflyer miles  then you can redeem flights for both pax,btohqsg
Do you know if it is possible to gift or transfer miles from Person A to Person B  especially if Person B is an official nominee?,btohqsg
I don't know of any  if there is then there will be a miles market already,btohqsg
But it's a good idea for an accm topic,btohqsg
Hi all Any cc that I can use to earn cashback or miles for pru and aia premium?,btohqsg
Buy voo or s27? Both have 30% dividend tax. Which one has higher commission upon trade?,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing.  I just came back from Hokkaido. I use my Amaze at one restaurant in Sapporo. The category on my Amaze app is â€˜Utilityâ€™.,btohqsg
Having said that  I observed that the categories for some shopping places are shown as dining. But thatâ€™s fine for me.,btohqsg
one method i do is after the first transaction on a place using general spending card  i see what amaze reflects it as.if suitable for a higher reward card  then the next time i go back to that place  i will use the higher reward card instead of the general spending card.,btohqsg
I just signed up using Chrisâ€™ Kris+ promo code. Does the rewards  require a day or two to be reflected in my account? What is the best way to top up Kris+ wallet to get the sure-win benefits?,btohqsg
May I ask  if overseas spending  amaze will be the better choice? I previously used youtrip.,btohqsg
Hi friends  I have recently downloaded the Kris+ app trying to link to my google pay but can't seem to do so. Anyone else facing the same issue?,btohqsg
Just curious  is your phone a Samsung and you use Samsung Pay?,btohqsg
My phone is a Samsung  but i mainly do my transactions with google pay,btohqsg
oh then.. you can ignore.. it will be removed after few days from your Krisflyer page...,btohqsg
Only if you pair Amaze with the right Mastercard. The idea is while Amaze has a much higher FX spread than YouTrip and Trust  your paired Mastercard must have higher reward % to offset the FX spread. You should watch Chris's video on amaze vs Trust to get the idea,btohqsg
Can someone here guide me how do I top up $5 to Kris+? I am referring to the sure-win promo Chris mention here.,btohqsg
For my cruise spends that's charged to my Amaze wallet  all is under the travel category! Safe to say it's not advisable to use CRMC + Amaze on cruises!,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing =) Thankfully  you use Amaze Wallet.,btohqsg
Glad that there's the 4% cashback for this period too! A straight up easy decision :),btohqsg
You guys received netflix email for account sharing? If yes? Wanna check if its already enforce?,btohqsg

Ohhh ok  so they dun let ppl share now. I thought it's another hack that we can share with more ppl  haha... Thanks for the reply!,btohqsg

Will reflect after first spend on Kris+ i think. For the sure-win draw  you have to click on kris+ miles then transfer from your bank portal. Not recommended to top-up large amounts  just a small amount of expiring points from bank portal will do,btohqsg
How does the HSBC Travelone points system work? The points will come in after end of statement month? cause i spent some amount but still no points in unlike Revolution,btohqsg
First 50 for every monthSign up after the 1st May. The first person managed to hit the spending amount of $500 or $1000. So best is to sign up and immediately make a big purchase. If you fullfill the qualifying spending on the 10 May you have to hope that you are still within the first 50,btohqsg
Some others have mentioned this whole uob thingy is very sketchy,btohqsg
Same like any other sign up reward where itâ€™s limited to the first 10/50/200 or so on. Very easy for the reward giver to claim awards all claimed,btohqsg
Yeaâ€¦ i usually avoid getting too hyped up on UOB promos like such,btohqsg
They claimed that i wasnt part of the first xxx even though i did all the requirements within 3 days,btohqsg
Chris  is the net positive gain better than Amaze+UOB Lady (6 mpd)?,btohqsg
depends on how u value miles,btohqsg
Within 3 days still cannot. Haiz.,btohqsg
Will you earn 6mpd for uob lady and 4mpd for citi rewards if you withdraw cash in Japan?,btohqsg
of cos not  withdraw from Amaze wallet,btohqsg
CRMC doesn't give 10x points on mobile wallet transactions. Does it mean I should not add it to Google Pay? Is this why CMRC is not good to use with Kris+?However  Amaze + CRMC is a legit combo  do does this mean Amaze is not viewed as a mobile wallet?,btohqsg
Anyway guys  my dbs card kena fraud transaction again  a good remind to track your card transaction,btohqsg
This time round charge by so call amazon seller repay...,btohqsg
Did you used your card in any oversea website ï¼Ÿ or use it when you were in overseas?,btohqsg
I seeThen do you suggest to use CRMC+Amaze to earn miles rather than uob lady when I am visiting Japan? Since we are not certain of MCC,btohqsg
or can useheymax.aito check the mcc for the merchant in japan,btohqsg
This is the 3rd fraud on card for dbs this month,btohqsg
How come DBS did not Re-issue a new card to you?,btohqsg
They did i kena 2 time on dbs women  the most recent one on 25 is altitude,btohqsg
