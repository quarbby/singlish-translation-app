Hi guys  anyone with experience using Alipay and Amaze card can help/share your experience on this please?I tried to make payment using Amaze-linked-with-uob-KF-card through Alipay app but i did not proceed to key in the Instarem Amaze SMS OTP to verify and authorise the transaction on the Alipay app. But the Instarem Amaze app now reflects that the amount is paid and the same transaction appeared as pending on my UOB app.I checked with CS of Instarem and they said that the transaction went through and is currently waiting to be claimed by the merchant. Hence  they cannot do anything about it.Does this mean the transaction is successful and i will be charged for this?Thank you!,btohqsg
Thank you all who attended Seedly PFF 2024 event!Hope you all enjoyed the sharing to accelerate your miles game‚úàÔ∏è,btohqsg
Any recording or TLDR to share with us?,btohqsg
what is the background?Why would you try to make payment and then don't proceed to key in OTP?,btohqsg
Was checking the mcc through the empty amaze wallet method then tried to make payment again but wanted to ensure that i have changed the amaze card link from wallet to uob cc so i didnt proceed with the OTP,btohqsg
actually sometimes it could just be a 'hold' on the failed transaction and money released within 1 week.so Amaze live chat said definitively it is an actual transaction and not a 'hold'?,btohqsg
Can wait for Seedly Youtube channel to share (if any),btohqsg
i encountered something rather similar in Family Mart where a failed transaction appeared in Amaze history but merchant confirmed he did not receive it (so obviously he won't be able to claim it).Within 7 days  the Amaze transaction disappeared.What I can advise u is to get confirmation / receipt from merchant showing your final mode of payment  so at least you have a record showing you actually already paid via METHOD X... then if amaze doesn't disappear  you can produce the evidence and dispute it as double charging,btohqsg
I see. Amaze said that the transaction is currently unclaimed by the merchant and if it is unclaimed within 8-14 days  it will be reversed. Not sure whether that may mean as a hold for the failed transaction. I will wait for a few days to see if it is reversed or posted,btohqsg
just make sure you retain the receipt from the China Merchant,btohqsg
Yes  don‚Äôt see in the internet banking  but wondering can select SCB,btohqsg
I see. I tried payment again after double checking the amaze card has been linked to my uob cc and my Alipay app shows only this latter transaction went through. I will monitor then. Thank you so much Mt! Really appreciate it üôèüôèüôè,btohqsg
Hi Credit Card Masters I‚Äôm foreigner working in Singapore about 8 years and yearly income about 45K 2 weeks ago I tried to apply UOB EVOL CC via online application  after 1 week later UOB email to me  my CC application is unsuccessful without giving any reason This is the my first time CC application in Singapore I tried to walk in UOB branches but they are keep saying that CC application is not handle by UOB branches May I know anyone have any idea why my CC application is unsuccessful and how should I do? Thanks,btohqsg
You can go to Cards and add the card under 'Singapore - VISA/MasterCard' as recipient. Then pay with your DBS bank account.,btohqsg
What is your nationality?If i am not wrong  for foreigners  the minimum income to qualify for SG credit card is $45kSo if some of your income e.g. meal allowance or overtime is not factored in by the bank  you could have fallen below the minimum statutory requirement.And UOB is well known to be stingy and conservative and cautious.Who do you bank with? where is your salary credited to? Maybe you try applying for credit card with that bank first.,btohqsg
I see DBS is $45k SCB is $60k.,btohqsg
they may not mean what they say... oops.. hahha,btohqsg
Maybe can opt for the 10k fixed deposit method first?Have you taken any loans with any banks/licensed moneylender in Singapore?,btohqsg
My nationality is Myanmar My income is more than their requirements 40K My salary also credited to my UOB one account The reason I trying to apply CC is to get cash back rewards from my monthly spending ,btohqsg
No I don‚Äôt have any loan from moneylender I tried talk to UOB counters but they don‚Äôt give me any idea and answer,btohqsg
Oh I mean to use pay bill  where I can charge to dbs cc,btohqsg
Ok  Singapore Government requires Income to be minimum $30k before credit card can be granted.It is up to the individual banks to follow this minimum or decide to adopt a more conservative stance and have internal requirement of say $40k or $60k for foreigners.From my interaction with UOB  even though they state $40k  I do not mean it as a joke when I say they may not mean it. Internally  they could really require $50k as an example.You could try doing the $10k secured deposit method FIRST to get a card... show some credit card repayment track record then request to convert to Unsecured (normal) credit card.,btohqsg
Have you updated your income on UOB internet banking website to your latest income before applying?,btohqsg
Hello  I want to know about the VOO tax imposed? Anyone can help to explain? Does it means it will tax my gain?,btohqsg

i received my uob one CC yesterday   will the statement end on the 12th? or next month 12th?,btohqsg
usually bank staff need to be very cautious with their replies as they would be held to it.so they will usually say don't know or pretend not to know..especially when not their department (credit risk decision),btohqsg
You can use UOB chat assist to chat with the CSO to find out the statement date.,btohqsg
okay so after talking with CSO  the default date is 12th  which will be for all your cards so in my case i activated it on  5/4  will be getting first statement on the 12/4 . So best is to change the statement date   which changing statement date will be applicable to ALL uob cardsHopefully this helps someone  uob first statement,btohqsg
Are we able to salary credit by ourselves for OCBC360 to qualify for the additional interest?,btohqsg

Hi need some help here on UOB Ladies Solitare Card. My statement cycle is mid month to mid month. From 1 April  I changed one of my bonus category from Family to Travel.

Chinese transactions are marked by banks as suspicious. When the ending merchant like didi or major brands restaurants charge  mostly will go through. But because each Alipay wallet can be linked to some weird entity the banks block it. For eg. every time I go China I have to message trust bank support to white list my transactions for the period travelled.Still sometimes it gets blocked  most of the time Alipay ones work more than WeChat ones though,btohqsg
It happened to me Shanghai. Had to message trust support to unlock my card. To give credit  they responded promptly.,btohqsg

But if you rotate the funds between 2 accounts  then how will the giro work? There won't be any funds for giro deduction for the other bank's credit card bills  tax  etc.,btohqsg

You just basically have to pay the account for the giro bills.,btohqsg

Exactly. That‚Äôs the highest level play,btohqsg
And if u are able to do this. U can say bye bye to Uob one earmark promo which is only 4.44% for 4.5 months lock in (lousier).Empty Uob one and wait for next plunging chicken promo.,btohqsg

Actually you will lose a bit coz I think max HSBC transfer limit is 250k? So u have to break the 360k into 2 days of transferring out. And it has to be routed to an another bank first before going back into the rotating HSBC account  so u r limited by that bank‚Äôs max transfer limit too.,btohqsg
U don‚Äôt really lose that much if the routing bank is scb esaver which has been paying 3.5-3.8% pa recently.,btohqsg

Hi  Query on SCB smart credit card.6% cashback i think is not calculated correctlyEg. I using it for transport and on average i get 1point for every dollar as per statement  So eg if i spend 100sgd on transport which will be equivalent to 100points and while i go on scb360 reward resumption page it shows 3200points is equal to sgd10.So maths is not working out what scb is claiming. ( if i spend 100 on transport i should get 6dollar back equivalent point which should be 3200/10 √ó6 = 1920).Pls correct if i am missing something,btohqsg
Your bonus rewards point will come in the following statement cycle,btohqsg
Well I thinking the rotating bank other then hsbc can transfer in and out within the same day doesn't affect isn't. But yes within transfer limit and lots of banks can do 200k.,btohqsg
it is about 3 days max delay in normal weekdaysit is about 6 days max delay even if kenna weekends$360k x 6 days x 1.15% = $88 difference.ALSO  what are you trying to fight this $360k with? Other comparables only have max $150k holding now.,btohqsg
Anyone know of any signup bonus for Citi rewards card for existing Citi cc clients?,btohqsg
Using March/April as example  if $360k28th March = $160k from HSBC to SCB29th March = $200k from HSBC to SCB1st April = $200k from SCB to HSBC2nd April = $160k from SCB to HSBC,btohqsg

Using 1 mile = 1.5 cents:Interest loss assuming 4% p.a. savings account elsewhere (adjust yourself if yours is lower) = $10001 x 0.04 / 12 = $33.342 Miles Gain for $1000 = 1000 x 2 x 0.015 = $30Not worth.

I currently with uob.. I thought OCBC will also cut interests but no news yet. Thinking want to change or not haha. The $500 savings incremental is depending one. Sometimes got big purchase then no more liao. I worried change Liao they cut interest also gg,btohqsg
They wait till every one move to ocbc üòÄ,btohqsg

Ohh..then stick with UOB first baüòÇ personally i feel since the $500 saving may not be guranteed then UOB is a better choice.Btw if you switch to ocbc using their cc is not mandatory. Anyway its 0.6% of interest for $500 of spending only. You can get better cashback/rewards rates with other cards out there.,btohqsg

I do have some opinions like OCBC 360.. but is there a better option out there?,btohqsg
How do you manage to get 800+ interest from uob one? Or is it uob one plus stash?,btohqsg

Thanks Melvyn  is the Moomoo 200k for 60 days worth ?,btohqsg
Unfortunately among high interest saving account only UOB 3% plus for 100k above can accept self transfer for salary credit purpose. OCBC require giro corporate account,btohqsg
No cashback. By right it also doesn‚Äôt count towards min spend of $600 but empirically it does count.,btohqsg
Yea I figured it out. But even with salary crediting.. they cannot match current UOB rate,btohqsg
You know Moomoo is investment and not saving account which means your capital is not guaranteed,btohqsg
Yes I'm aware. But I see cash plus never once fail. And even if it drop  moomoo will still compensate the losses for this campaign right?,btohqsg

If your 200k is your emergency cash  then 150k in UOB one is still a good option considering it is easy to meet the requirement and you don‚Äôt need to worry about incremental MAB. The other 50k you can put in funds to earn 6-7% plus if you prepare to take some ups and downs. At least you not risking the whole 200k,btohqsg
And do you have emergency funds kept somewhere,btohqsg
This 200k will be low risk. I have a portion at high risk and it didn't go too well.. I sold off too fast.,btohqsg
I do . About 20k easily.,btohqsg
I invest in gold. I can sell for profit now but that's emergency funds.. so yah.. no need to sell yet.. hopefully won't have to.,btohqsg

i think chris has video on investment  theres many different tiers of investing   safer to more riskier investment,btohqsg
safer to more risker investment? what u mean? u mean its safer to take risk?,btohqsg
Just to nag again and again as I‚Äôm really anti insurance agents for investment.U will see many of the YouTubers bash investing using insurance agents. This is very very true.Do not use insurance agents to invest. They are qualified to sell insurance I won‚Äôt deny. But they are certainly not qualified to give u good advice on investments.,btohqsg
in the video he talked about 5 kind of investments   from safer  investments to higher risk investment,btohqsg

Singapore savings bond. Emergency funds should have number one priority where capital is protected. Only cash deposits and govt bonds fit the highest level of safety.SSB also allows you to liquidate for cash within 1 month.You also lock in ~3% yield for the next ten years  everyone is talking about rate cuts  so locking in 3% yield is a pretty good optionBeyond the emergency fund  invest in it,btohqsg
Wonder if anyone who bought cash value insurance policies can share how their policies are doing in last 5 years. Got the projected 4.75% pa or not,btohqsg

Not sure if anyone has replied you. DBS $15  SCB $5 (waived if priority cust). I heard UOB is free,btohqsg
Thank you! So really need to compare and choose the right bank!,btohqsg
yes me  got 4 policies with cash value!,btohqsg
I see. What‚Äôs the percentage gain. N how long held?To be clear. Net surrender values. Don‚Äôt include the locked bonus units.,btohqsg
1 was bought by my parents when i was born. Premium payment period is over. So anytime can surrender. Going at 11% gain.2 Endowment plans. One was single premium and one still currently paying 5 year premium.Pardon  the last one is an ILP started 3.5 mnths ago at 48.75% absolute returns.,btohqsg
"the one brought by your parents   when did they buy? cause i have one also that is 25 years  and the policy document dont show any ""fees and charges"" only approximate returns after xx years. but per month now i seeing about 2% gain PER MONTH. Is there any fees or charges for yours?",btohqsg
A) 11% gain for I‚Äôm guessing 20 years?B) how‚Äôs the net surrender values vs total premiums paid nowC) 48% gain after 3.5 months?,btohqsg
I am 24 this year! So like it was a 20 year payment. They bought it in 2000.No fees or charges anymore as the premiums have been fully paid off. So no more death benefit charge or whatever. Now its just a fully liquid sum assured + cash value policy increasing depends on the participating funds performanceKeeping it for a condo downpayment or something when I see a launch i like.,btohqsg
A) YesB) Pretty good. The single premium was bought for my parents as an additional retirement plan. So it comes with guranteed and non- guranteed payouts. Would be helpful in addition to their cpf payouts.As for the 5 year payment  its for myself to have an addition source of passive income. Still paying for it and again  the cash value is doing well. But still early to say.C) yeap i entered the market in mid december. So i guess it was a pretty good period! Entered with $12K and now at $17.8K ish!,btohqsg
B) have the distributions been above 4% pa consistently considering the same single premium put in the bank now can yield u 3-4% pa.C) did u observe the underlying in your ILP. If u bought the same underlying yourself. Gain how much?,btohqsg
Earn up to 4.60% p.a. interest on your SGD savings with your Everyday Global Account.,btohqsg
up to 4.6% means how many %???,btohqsg
3.6% on incremental above reference month1% on incremental above previous month,btohqsg
and $$$$ can take out anytime right?,btohqsg
B) Yes. It has been well above 4% (Roughly 6.2%) Plus I am constantly moving my $$ around to take advantage of all the higher PA across the various banks.Somehow my advisor was knowledgable enough regarding the upcoming FED interest rate cut rates so we pushed the $$ around again. And now going back to re-allocate the funds after the current reduction in interest rates across the banks in SG.C) Yes i personally handpicked the funds after my research. I did the alpha allocation myself as well. Took advantage of the instituitional investment funds and invested in funds that i wont be able to invest in as a private investor to diversify my portfolio!,btohqsg
mine is paid for just nice 25 years at $46.7 monthlyseems to be calculated monthly   from my calculation seems to be doing about 3.6% p.a.total cash value = 23989.64,btohqsg

B) nice. The endowment seems like a good fit to your strategy.C) if you handpicked the funds yourself. Why not buy the funds yourself. There is no fund u cannot buy yourself that insurance agents claim u can‚Äôt buy yourself. It‚Äôs all packaging ruse.,btohqsg
3.6% pa is decent. Win cpf OA!,btohqsg
C) I am a full time student and also running a biz on the side. As much as I would love to take the time and effort to follow the market etc  I simply choose to spend the time with my family and friends instead.So i rather took months exploring various advisors and their pathadologies to choose the right one who aligns with my goals and yea  let them settle for me lor haha,btohqsg
i just took over the endowment plan   currently looking at 2% returns per month   not sure if the fees are high   trying to get more info from insurance company but generic replies ü§∑,btohqsg
I help them thank u for your fees!No right no wrong. Paying for convenience is also what many would do.,btohqsg
Doesn‚Äôt your plan come with a Mas mandated info page with the fees declared?,btohqsg
Plus roboadvisors with their perpetual fees was rather concerning. And if i were to invest on my own on other platforms there are other risks too like  platform risks  exchange rate risks etc which are not insured by SDIC. And right now my funds in my ILP are performing btr then S&P500. So really i thank them too!,btohqsg
it was brought in 1999 üòÖüòÖ i read the entire policy   i dont see anything relating to fees,btohqsg
Old era don‚Äôt have. That‚Äôs why kenna complained n now have to declare.,btohqsg
cause my father brought it for me when i was baby then he want me to pay on my own already so passed it to me,btohqsg
OK. Btw lol. I think u type wrong right. You saying 2% return per month. üòÖ,btohqsg
Endowment u should consider surrendering when matured. And use the proceeds to invest on your own.Can I ask for the 25 year endowment policy. Was the final matured cash value close to the original projection given by agent when policy was purchased? U know the very nice and big numbers table.,btohqsg
now showing 2% increment per month  so i want to know whats the fees and charges first before proceeding to surrender,btohqsg
i was going to cancel but i went in the system to check there was 2% increase over previous month  so better to know if the fees are too high before doing anything,btohqsg
matured cash value is slightly higher than projection value,btohqsg
Which credit card is best to apply for self-employed?,btohqsg
If u don‚Äôt mind going back to A).So after 20 ish years. It is up 11% absolute against total premiums paid.Isn‚Äôt that very far off from what‚Äôs projected?If I‚Äôm not wrong (rusty)  year 2000 the agents were using5% pa normal scenario7.5% pa high scenarioWhen presenting to clients to buy on day 1.,btohqsg
U have the year 25 projection figure based on day 1 papers?Because insurers tend to adjust the figures as the years pass.,btohqsg
yeah i have   i can send later,btohqsg
Thanks. No offence because u said 3.6% pa.If it‚Äôs matured as projected on day 1. It should be at least 5% pa.And u would agree with me.3.6% pa compoundedVs5% pa compoundedIs a big big big big difference. Over 25 years,btohqsg
cause based on compounding interest calculator i keyed in   its about 3.6~,btohqsg
U see if u can dig up the projected figures based on Day 1 papers. That one is the rosy 5% pa 7.5% pa I was referencing.,btohqsg
This is always what I dare agents to show me when they try to sell me.Show me an actual year 2000 projection of a policy sold. And the final matured cash value in say 2020.I want to see whether the projected maturity value claimed in 2000 really matches what the real person got in year 2020.I did that with a couple of agents. Nobody got back to me.,btohqsg
Investment moats did an investigation before. Mostly ended up as BS.,btohqsg
Some agent just show what they want you to see.. everyone need to practise their due diligent when it comes to such product,btohqsg
What do u mean trigger manually?,btohqsg

Ah yes. Sorry I was looking at protection level.Eh not bad. Projection and actual quite close.,btohqsg
Ya not bad actually. But OP still needs to pay that's all.,btohqsg
Only one page? Got low and high projections?Or is this non participating,btohqsg
This kind of pre-2000 policy documents  a lot like that one leh... Non participating won't have non-guaranteed portion le.,btohqsg
This one is the 2000s-2010s documents. Then sometime in 2010s and now is 3.25% and 4.75%. Must dig out MAS rules.,btohqsg
I remember my 2000s documents is 5% and 7% also. But after 2014 one showing 3.25% and 4.75%. They even give you estimated EIR at either rates.,btohqsg
So this crowd sourced results is quite consistent with wz actual results. 3.6% pa for 25 years is ok ok la considering there were a good many years us rates near 0.Forced savings in a sense. üëç,btohqsg
GE S-Lion one looks like those kind of cashback endowments that let you take cashback yearly. ü§î If not don't make sense to be negative one. Unless is investment plan  but 1996 don't think got much ILPs also..,btohqsg
Remember bank account savings rates won‚Äôt be at 4% pa forever. Confirmed peaked and will come down. Just when.,btohqsg
Maybe policy owner borrowed against it? Policy Loan rates are high.,btohqsg
Do you reckon bank will cut saving rates by a lot next year?,btohqsg
Probably also. That's why these crowdsourced info need more info not just based on table üëÄ,btohqsg
The cuts will be correlated with the speed US cut rates though may not be 1:1.,btohqsg
Good to lock in SSBs if u haven‚Äôt already.,btohqsg
That's why insurance companies can sell endowments.. because the fixed guaranteed cash really look attractive compared to those days when bank accounts only give at most 1% p.a. Then when you include the non-guaranteed cash values  ü§Ø,btohqsg
SSB can‚Äôt catch up with inflation . Jin headache,btohqsg
U want safe. Nothing can beat inflation one. Sure have some risks,btohqsg
For me  maybe I too lazy lol. Jin tired to monitor. I guess etf is best suited for me,btohqsg
Mkt has run up by so much already  do u think the current 3.35 FD is reasonable? Or mkt can go up somemore?,btohqsg
Yeah etf might be decent. Cheaper method than unit trusts.Do some research and buy ETFs yourself using a cheap and reliable platform. Just don‚Äôt buy through insurance agents or bank pfcs.,btohqsg

With UOB One account nerfed  those who have less than 75k (probably started work/put most of their money elsewhere)  but are able to meet the spend  save and salary criteria would prefer OCBC 360 account's 3.85% p.a. but if they only spend less than $800 on the OCBC 365 card  they'll lose the bonus cashback (which isn't that good in the first place).You can always forgo the tiny 0.6% p.a. for the monthly $40 cashback on the UOB EVOL card. To match $40 cashback with 0.6% p.a. interest  you'll need to have at least 81k in the account  which then you'll probably wouldn't mind not getting the bonus cashback on OCBC 365 card.,btohqsg
Tbill / FD whichever gives you higher than OA just go üòù,btohqsg
You mean it is better to stick with UOB EVOL and UOB One Account instead of switching over to OCBC 360 and OCBC 365?,btohqsg
Assuming OCBC don‚Äôt adjust their rates.,btohqsg
Got my first ocbc 360 interest today! But smaller then what j expected .. I am expecting 4.65% but maybe my funding not high enough... to max the tier I need how much to be in please? I thought 75k above?,btohqsg
I thought the earn bouns interest is only 500sgd and u can pair with ocbc infinity for 1.6% cashback without minimum spend,btohqsg
Tnc says so  but no harm trying,btohqsg
Based on 75k  salary  save n spend EIR is 3.85%.If U looking at 4.65%  then 100k  salary  save n spend,btohqsg
Yes. Infinity spending 500$ is eligible for bonus interest.Take note the 500$ spend must be eligible spend.,btohqsg

Thank you! Gotcha! Then it's very easy to get over 100k if keep growing 500sgd per month,btohqsg
When the amount exceed Ur comfy level  then U rotate out n find somewhere to park for 1mth to reset back to 100k,btohqsg
Yea I got the calculator but to figure out the lumpsum need keep trial and error to find the perfect number,btohqsg
Usually is best from what 99000 then 500 2 times then reset 1 time?,btohqsg
you still need $500 minimum spend for acct 360 if want to get extra interest,btohqsg
No fee ah  what u see for the rate is what u get,btohqsg
what not buy t bills get a bit higher?,btohqsg
I start with 100K and adding $501 every month  will reset after 12 mths which is 106K,btohqsg

Can I confirm.. I use a credit card to top up amaze ewallet SGD first. Then inside Amaze ewallet I convert SGD to MYR. Then in TNG ewallet app  I top up using my Amaze card (which set to amaze ewallet) then for example amaze I got 350MYR then I transfer 350MYR to TNG ewallet so my TNG ewallet will have exact 350MYR without any fees right? Is there a cap for transfer?,btohqsg
May 30 US t bill yields 5.35%,btohqsg
And rem to add 500 on the 1st of every month.For me I add 520. Cause of PH n credit date etc.... lazy to count the ADB for the particular month,btohqsg

Yes  but as usual subject to hsbc changes in tnc,btohqsg
Find out if what happens if moo moo goes down while u are invested in cash plus.It‚Äôs china origin company.,btohqsg
Alright! Thanks Queenie! I was headache about whether I should adopt TNG ewallet app haha. I never use before  have been using cash instead.. for those merchant cannot use amaze card de.,btohqsg
Tng have a reward program of their own to redeem merchant voucher so i am all for tng,btohqsg
Plus i dont need to carry too much cash and deal with the loose change,btohqsg
Yes I always feel cashless is more hygienic.,btohqsg
So just need to make sure u have data when go malaysia  amt can be top up anytime as long as u have access to otp and internet.,btohqsg
Anyone has annual fee rejected waiver request before by standard chartered?,btohqsg
If no RM then how haha  not a banking acc customer,btohqsg
It‚Äôs probably their strategy to reduce their credit card customer base. Don‚Äôt ask me why. But recent months many dp that scb refuse to waive annual fee.For myself even with rm appeal took over 1 month. I paid the fee first then they credit back,btohqsg
If you cancel the cc do u still need to pay for the annual fee?,btohqsg
Question. If I want to use cardup for 100K payment  it is best to use UOB KF card since it is uncapped. Right?,btohqsg
Cos it‚Äôs a flexi account . Allows me to withdraw 30 days later after I notify them,btohqsg
Cardup transaction only give base rate so better off with uob privi  unless you have those high income earner card.,btohqsg
Any monthly cap on UOB Privi?,btohqsg
No cap  it is a general spending card that come with 3 version  amex  visa  master,btohqsg
That is good. I will then be able to get the max miles for the 100K.,btohqsg
Using cardup won‚Äôt affect right? From hsbc pov  it is just dependent on whether 1% cashback is still eligible for paying cc bills,btohqsg
Yes correct  hsbc wont know what u clock on other bank cc,btohqsg
even u directly link credit card to amaze and top up tng  it is still no fees,btohqsg
Ok thank you! I just submitted my giro forms for cc and car loans etc  trying to figure out how to tap in cardup now. üòÖ,btohqsg
Yes but the rate suck and no reward,btohqsg
oh yes true that makes sense  i should do that too,btohqsg
citi cashback used to give cashback for tng wallet top up through amaze  now no more,btohqsg
Did they? Tng mcc is 6540 and citicashback plus is 1.6 cashback compare to amaze spot rate of 2-2.5  still dont make sense,btohqsg
yes they did  been using over a few years. only past few months i notice no more cashback,btohqsg
Bank are covering all the loophole,btohqsg
Exactly. Now not safe to discuss too much in open forums. Not that there are many loopholes left.,btohqsg
so actually for all myr transaction  its better to top up wallet and use myr from there isnt it? in amaze,btohqsg
even if im directly using contactless  i only got ~3.44 rate 2 weeks ago on direct amaze card linked to cc  if i use top up wallet and convert to myr  around 3.52,btohqsg
But u forgot the cc reward,btohqsg
I still use cc with amaze by default at place that take card and those that dont i use tng  but please dont treat it like a remittance service as it will cause it to be nerf like ichange. System not mean to be abuse.Cause i just to top up with amaze wallet and the payment got reverse by amaze  have to see if it is working.,btohqsg
i use citi cashback only  1.6%  not as good as compared to the wallet direct conversion,btohqsg
I use maybank fnf with amaze in malaysia,btohqsg
And seriously if everytime info is been shared and it get nerf coz ppl abuse it then i dont think any one will want to share anymore,btohqsg
Wah  country garden tio suspended‚Ä¶ scary siah ..,btohqsg
I see I see.. no point then. Can just register for new account.,btohqsg
But i have try to top up tng with amaze wallet just now  all reverse so hopefully not a perm thing. Still working fine on 7 apr,btohqsg
Update: got my 6.8% p.a. bonus cash coupon credited (at the end of 60 days exactly) and submitted for withdrawal. Previous 1 Feb campaign,btohqsg
reverse? i just topped up $20 it was ok,btohqsg
I try to use my myr in my amaze wallet to top up tng  even 20 myr got reverse,btohqsg
Not sure why mine got rejected,btohqsg
Will try again tml maybe coz going to jb on thursday,btohqsg
Just do small amt first if anyone is new  dont pump in big amt then trigger some alert coz new tng acct have the tendacy to trigger fraud alert when topping up big amt,btohqsg
Hi  for hospital bill (8062)  do I still earn miles if I use Citi+amaze ?,btohqsg
if on android  from the uob tmrw app can add onto google pay,btohqsg
I don't know if this counts as a hack..Recently I introduced Tuaspower to a number of my friends  and as they usually just do BANK GIRO for their power and SP Power bills  I volunteered to help them pay their monthly SP Power bills (Tuaspower is SP Power billing) and I give them 2% discount (win win).This can easily help you meet your $2k per month UOB One spending tier requirement.As long as the house owner invites you to their SP App family  you will be able to easily see and pay their SP Bill with your own SP App.,btohqsg
Yeah of course... decades old friends  and their downstreamthe topic started when they asked me which Power company to recontract with,btohqsg
Yea I did that but I'm overseas right now so wanna add into Amaze instead,btohqsg

just for miles collection and to make use one of the singsaver deals and free lounge access,btohqsg

Hi All  as I have an upcoming surgery  I am currently looking to get a no cap CC (preferably with no min. spending) that can be use for HealthHub app and general spendings that HSBC Revol cant cover (ie Courts  Groceries (post-nerf)  SimplyGO etc.). Currently i am holding 3 CC; UOB Ladies (Dining) - HSBC Revol - UOB AMEX ABS (might cancel after the 0.3% local spending nerf kicks in)I have some options in mind. Appreciate if I could get some advice on the below:1) No miles expiry card (prefer with $1 block): Citi Premier Miles ; SCB JOURNEYS*altho its $5 block  maybe DBS Altitude too‚Ä¶?*or2) UOB Prvi Miles so i could pool together with UOB Ladies CC UOB$.Open to more options/advices if any.Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Based in My DBS experience  You need to login to your ibanking and do the transfer back to your CPF. Otherwise  the bank will transfer back to OA on certain date,btohqsg
then it should be in your CPF OA loh,btohqsg
I never check UOB webpage and now I know why. Thanks for the help!,btohqsg
You loose 1 month of CPF OA interest,btohqsg
hard way to learn the lesson but well just suck it,btohqsg
i think the btr question is why are u donating so much to them? hhahaha,btohqsg
Just keep rolling lo  so far it‚Äôs been a consistent 5.0x% for the past year,btohqsg
sounds abit contradicting if u are donating away so much and looking to earn from it. but that's my take which i am just curious,btohqsg
just curious why do you define those prior contents cum comments as ‚Äúunnecessary parts‚Äù though?,btohqsg
Just use AMEX True Cashback if you think the platinum is not worth it.,btohqsg
Don't think have any long term impact,btohqsg
As long as it is not excluded from the t&C  then ok (just no points),btohqsg
Citi rewards + amaze (check mcc is not excluded),btohqsg
kopitiam mcc is 5814 on fairprice app  should be fine,btohqsg
Is it need to login to bank investment account to do transfers to CPFOA by ourselves?,btohqsg
seems like it. I just initiated it and will see when they transfer in,btohqsg
Uob is so much easier. No nonsense like scb recently,btohqsg
Thank u very much. Seth has made that same suggestion as well. üôèüèª,btohqsg
The cashback only comes in the end of following month.,btohqsg
Yes. IA to OA need to self initiate transfer. It does not earn interest until the following month after transfering back to OA. And they will charge the transaction fee when you transfer.,btohqsg

Hi all  I have a financial question on BTO flats. Using a hypothetical scenario where I take on a HDB loan:My remaining balance to pay for the flat (after deducting my entire OA): $500kAssume the max. available loan amount from HDB is also $500kIs there any way to partially pay down the $500k 'remaining balance' with cash (let's say $100k)  and then take on a HDB loan (on the date of key collection) of $400k? From what I understood  HDBdoes not allowus to pay down the 'remaining balance' partially with cash.Thank you for any help on this! üôè,btohqsg
Hdb loan has no early repayment penalty. After collecting the hdb with $500k loan  u can login to hdb website and pay off $100k if you want.,btohqsg
Although I don‚Äôt understand why u would wanna do that.Hdb loan is 2.6% paU put your cash into any high yield savings account also have 3.5% pa at least.,btohqsg
Perfectly understood üôè. I wanted to know if there's that possibility of early repaymentSo if we assume interest rates stay where they are now (assumption)  then it would be better to take the 'longest repayment period option' to repay my loan  right?,btohqsg
Yes. Hdb loan is one of the cheapest longest and most flexible repayment loan u can take in your life. Maximise it.,btohqsg
Ya la. Keep for those who need it la. U earn big big take bank loan la. Haha,btohqsg
Bank is heartless if U suay suay default. They may force U sell flat,btohqsg
No la is my fiancee la‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt earn that much myself,btohqsg
But I agree la. Hdb loan and SOB/BTO are SG privilege. Enjoy it.,btohqsg
Next time 10 year MOP timeframe don‚Äôt know how liao,btohqsg
If can get HDB loan pls get HDB loan. Govt look after citizens interest over bank interests coz they need votes.,btohqsg
Anyways can refinance with Banks if the interests rates become as low as during covid,btohqsg

Hi  I tried searching for more info on amaze card but still didn't get a clear answer to my query. Will appreciate if you or anyone could let me know if I link amaze card with maybank FnF card and make payments in Malaysia (in RM) thru amaze card  will amaze card charge the amount in SGD to maybank credit card and therefore I won't kenna FX or DCC charges by maybank? üôè,btohqsg
Yes amaze will convert it to sgd,btohqsg
Thanks! I should have joined this group much earlier. Lol,btohqsg
Oh  but maybank FnF 8% cashback is only on RM spending... So if amaze charge SGD to it  so don't think I will get 8% cash back if I use amaze linked to FnF if my understanding is correct.,btohqsg
If you had spent more than $800 in Singapore on that month n hit maximum cashback  it is better not to use Amaze+FnF  so you continue enjoy 8% onRinggitspend.For details  pls readhttps://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-family-and-friends-mastercard.page?,btohqsg
Go see my explanation on how maybank fnf work when u spend on bonus cat of maybank fnf in ringgit earlier,btohqsg

How many credit cards do u guys own? Mainly for cashback or miles or privileges?,btohqsg
How come MCC 3 numbers? üòÇ,btohqsg
I think effective cashback is approximately 4.75% after deducting 3.25% for FX charge,btohqsg
Btw  it is 100% confirmed (even though we already interpretated as such from the Citibank notification).All my Citibank Cashback GROCERY spend in March 2024 only got 6% cashback (already nerfed for me from 8% to 6% on 10th March 2024) because my statement date is 10th March to 10th April 2024.,btohqsg
Yup and private commute can get 8%.,btohqsg
My statement was 5th April but I had 8% for groceries.,btohqsg
really? you count properly or not...or maybe you lucky fell into the 'transiting' calculation phase.my statement 10th april  and i am looking at it right now. Confirmed 6% only (and i only spend on groceries using Citi Cashback).^Private commute  petrol  dining and groceries transactions will earn the revised bonus cash back rates if yourstatement date falls after 31 March 2024 as bonus cash back is computed on your statement end date based on yourtotal spend amount.,btohqsg
Citi also don‚Äôt know how it worksThey give 0% bonus for my private commute  but according to TnC it should be at a revised rateGrocery - 5.8% (revised rate)Private commute 0% (old rate)I talked to about 5-6 CSO  and all reply with stupid answers like March gets old bonus rate. When I say why my grocery got the new rate (which is correct according to TnC)  they couldn‚Äôt answer and new CSO started from the beginning. I fed up and demanded to talk to product manager. Only then they acknowledged. Now waiting for my bonus üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes 2 tbills. Is this like a one off expense?,btohqsg
$1014.99 spending  $61.35 cashback = 6% cashback. SIGH.,btohqsg
quarterly $2 per tbill.so don't spread your eggs too much.. try to buy in big sizes  and lesser tbills,btohqsg
Quarterly service charge of $2.18 per T-bill,btohqsg
okok‚Ä¶ didnt know this. any other fees i should take note off?,btohqsg
No need count.. I top up $800 to gift card only no other spent any way is last burst of fire.,btohqsg
how did they breakdown your cashback box as per my example?,btohqsg
Transaction fees  example if you top-up/rsp to endowus  etc. DBS charges the highest  lowest is UOB.,btohqsg
So you got $2 base and $62 bonus?,btohqsg
Ah the bill was March not April see wrongly üòÇ,btohqsg
hahaha.. ok ok i know you are not intentional... all good all good...,btohqsg
Because I foresee this issue from UOB nerf last time so bought earlier,btohqsg
It is still a good card for food.,btohqsg

Max out meaning? There‚Äôs a cap to the points awarded on Citi?,btohqsg

Those cards that you hold give max $1k rewards.If you have UOB Krisflyer   can buy via OTAs that eligible for 3mpd if you have $800 spend on SQ related.If UOBKF is not suitable for you  have you explore buying 1 way ticket in near month end of month A and return flight in early part of 2nd month? Compare how much difference if using this method against buying full return ticket.,btohqsg
