If need to scared this scared that  better don’t use them. Your phone will get hacked too.,btohqsg
Even if your car won’t be hackedIn Malaysia  they will tow your car away,btohqsg

Especially Malaysia  if they want to steal your car  they tow it away. They won’t spend time trying to hack your car  open your car door and jump start etc.It’s because of things left on seats  broke the window to steal the things. That’s because of negligence.,btohqsg
