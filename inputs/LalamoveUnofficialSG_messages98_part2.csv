Just to share..There will be alot of nice +++ orders for the Xmas season... but be careful when stacking.. coz there will be alot of orders so expect some delays..If wanna stack.. stack from the same restaurant to deliver to the same area..,btohqsg
Looking for drivers üöóMulti drops! Avg more than 6 drops!Pick up location: fishery portPick up Time: 840-9amItems: Seafood (can be heavy  bring a trolley just in case)$7 per drop (clustered)Only need to commit FRIDAY & SATURDAY! Pm if keen.Payment once job completed!,btohqsg
Same timing can stack now? Oddle no more soft ban?,btohqsg
Icic noted. Now can't even use tpg to enter the app lolxxx keeps on saying check network connection.,btohqsg
Have to know the restaurant... what food they prepare.. this one confirm ready b4 pickup time..,btohqsg
Wa I didn‚Äôt know same timing can stack,btohqsg
If you kena complain for stacking gg for you. By SOP stacking not allowed.,btohqsg
I dunno... i nvr had a ban b4 when stacking coz i always nvr late.. must stack smartly (same pickup and same delivery area)..but i haven't been doing since 3rd Nov... so.. we will see the next few days whether they ban me or not... ü§ûü§û,btohqsg
Anyone know when Royal Briyani will tt the payment ? I delivered their order till now no receive payment üßê,btohqsg
Nvr mind lor... during xmas they need more drivers.. so hopefully lor dun kena ban.. ü§ûü§ûü§ûBut kena ban nvr mind la.. just do for extra cash only when free..,btohqsg
Person who book is recipient or restaurant? Sometimes eater will book lala and order self collect from the restaurant.,btohqsg
They note my phone number in their payment book,btohqsg
Then you need to collect payment while collecting the item. If paynow you need to check they transferred before you leave to deliver,btohqsg
But i look at this way.. i have always responsibly stacked before..Neways.. same pickup restaurant.. same area of delivery Tampines..If i kena ban.. means they have to find 2 new drivers... mean plus me 3 drivers out during busy xmas period during that pickup time..,btohqsg
I always stack responsibly too  never late. Only stack same area pick up and drop off. I kena ban until scared now don't dare to stack.,btohqsg
Think i need to call them for the payment then  anyone got the royal briyani number ? I forgotten to safe down,btohqsg
See on google maps  if cannot contact go to lalamove live chat,btohqsg
When do they ban u? After u complete the order? Or they will ban u and take away the order.. coz my orders are the 24th..,btohqsg
If like this Xmas period hard to get $400/day like last year lor.. haizz,btohqsg
They will usually cancel the latter order. You jus took the order? If kena ban by tmr u will know already. Then kena soft ban one day LL,btohqsg
Ya i see so many orders same pick up same area LL don't dare take,btohqsg
This is why last time ppl spoil market... late until cannot stack anymore..,btohqsg
No problem. Gd luck! Let me know if u kena anot,btohqsg
If cannot stack.. i rather they take away all my orders.. not worth doing if cannot stack..,btohqsg
Ya exactly. But no choice la in the first place stacking not allowed mah.. Now i make sure my oddle orders at least 1h apart. Then in btw see if got non oddle one can stack otw,btohqsg
Now abit difficult liao  cos alot of cars nowdays  traffic is bad,btohqsg
Gone were the good old days... üò≠,btohqsg
No more liao la... Now one day can get $200 damn gd liao,btohqsg
