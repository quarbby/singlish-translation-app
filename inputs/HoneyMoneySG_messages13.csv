Hsbc revolution also no cover utility,btohqsg
Seem like amex true Cash back does,btohqsg
Haha. Edit mine post now Dbs live MoreSo shopping and online and and retail and super market -dbs liveSimply go dbs liveUtility amex true Cash Back,btohqsg
Wondering grab still will cover utility after 14oct,btohqsg
hsbc has put my application on hold for like 2 months now…,btohqsg
After 14 oct grab looks like more for on-line and f&b,btohqsg
Less for retailersYa hsbc one took doggy yrs to process,btohqsg
Amex & SCB I find it's faster,btohqsg
Maybank I find it's cmi processing,btohqsg
hsbc revo cover only white list of mcc  dun think that is more,btohqsg
U need to check the McC if u go there often,btohqsg
Cover most e-commerceLike Amazon shoppee Lazada example,btohqsg
ya dbs livefresh cover those as well,btohqsg
yea scb took about 2 days to approve  citi like almost same day. HSBC… is unbelievably slow and long and customer support is non existent :(,btohqsg
Seem like most cc don't cover utility,btohqsg
yes everything online/contactless are covered except those excluded. In fact it covers everything under hsbc revolution and more. Just that there is a smaller cap and there is minimum spend to meet.,btohqsg
only worth considering when there is promo,btohqsg
Ya it's more general compared to hsbc Revo is more specific with the MCC,btohqsg
Wondering if the yearly fee can get waived easy or not I heard some user encounter can't on dbs or posb cards,btohqsg
Guess if grab no more point on utility payment like power and mobile and on-line subcripion maybe need go switch to amex Liao since most common cc don't cover utility,btohqsg
think not all utility company accept Amex,btohqsg

With Frank ocbc nerf dino Evol uob and dbs live will get nerf next,btohqsg
Let say dbs live vs uob Evol which is better looks so similar,btohqsg
The uob Evol free grab voucher how is work? Add and top up into grab wallet?,btohqsg
Looks like both dbs live & uob Evol Cashback each catagory is around $300 or $250 need to spend to max out each catagory of $20 max CashbackSo if ovee shot it won't have more Cashback ane need to use another card,btohqsg
What good is uob Evol no fee to worry and call in to ask for fee waiver vs dbs live,btohqsg
I did a review awhile backhttps://youtu.be/kfCwHJdESVU,btohqsg
Ya ita the catalory one sometime hard to match or if overshot kinda bad,btohqsg
Must spend onlne and offlone to match up the Total min spending,btohqsg
does the dbs app have a way to track which categories you spent for using live fresh card?,btohqsg
Ya looks messy Ned do homework,btohqsg
The uob one Cashback of 50 100 300 is it total 3 month they give only $50 if we spent 500 each month for 3 mth?,btohqsg
And since it's calculate in 3 month let say I sign up In end October and I Nov then got the card so I left Nov Dec to chalk up the Cashback?,btohqsg
what credit card good to pay bill at axs ?,btohqsg
Hi can I check if anyone created webull account ? Is it good for fractional shares and is the platform easy to use ?,btohqsg
1st quarter  get 1/3 of cashback if clock 3rd month  2/3 if clock 2nd and 3rd month. btw now is $50/$100/$200 quarterly rebate  highest tier no more $300,btohqsg
I guess now is a nerf,btohqsg
So it's total $50 for 3 month,btohqsg
With this Nerf still worth it ?,btohqsg
not really  even uob evol is better unless spending lots on those merchants with bonus rebate like guardian/cold storage/giant/shopee/utilities/grab,btohqsg
But evol and DBs live need to track your spend like online and contactless,btohqsg
And category only max spending of $250 to 300,btohqsg
If we didn't spend at least $250 on a certain catagory then I guess can't meet the $600 min spending,btohqsg
Hi guys  how do I check when would my card spending limit would be reset for 10x rewards for Citi rewards card? As it’s only $1000/month,btohqsg
I recall SCb smart promotion rate for simply go ends in end of 2022,btohqsg
Then mostly is wont extend so either DBs live or uob evol is best bad for simply go,btohqsg
not much diff lah  uob one need to be sure to meet the spending for all 3 months of quarter.,btohqsg
Wonder ifIst month 5602nd month 7003nd month 900I suppose this consider as the tier 1 Cashback of $50,btohqsg
Unless we2nd optionIst month 10002nd month 10013nd month 1023I suppose this consider as the tier 2 Cashback of $100,btohqsg
As compared to uob evol and DBs live need to meet the 3 category of min $600,btohqsg
Can UOB Preferred Platinum worm with Kris+?,btohqsg
hmm.. no ah  does it count as mobile contactless? coz if it does  then no need to see MCC,btohqsg
Ppv has a white list for online spending,btohqsg
hmm.. I don't think it's considered as online spend,btohqsg
my citi rewards did not get it,btohqsg
it is online mobile in-app. Citi rewards exclude this. Uob ppv treat it as online  and only get 4mpd for whitelist of mcc.,btohqsg
So need to use HSBC revolution or DBS WW MC?,btohqsg
yes  so effective rebate less than 3.33%,btohqsg
yes. hsbc revolution also need to be under whitelist of MCC  bigger list than PPV's though.,btohqsg
Hsbc Revo I think it's 2.4 or 2.5% Cashback am I right,btohqsg
uob evol and dbs live fresh need to meet $600 min spend  with cap on mobile contactless/ contactless rebate and separate cap on online rebate. For dbs live fresh can get full 5% so long spend min $600  within the caps for contactless/online rebate; can easily make up the min spend by topping up prepaid cards for example though no 5%. Uob evol ideally need $250 online+$250 mobile contactless+$100 others to max out the rebate; can also spend more on online/mobile contactless to make up the $100 though effective rebate will be lower.,btohqsg
10x points=2.5% for online/contactless on the whitelist of mcc.,btohqsg
Ya both alao need to meet the $600 specific catagory $250 each then can get the Cashback but I guessed uob one more all rounder just need to meet the $500 min,btohqsg
Don't always spend online $250 the the contactless still ok,btohqsg
Good morning  any comments/view about gearing / leveraging?,btohqsg
Not good in current high interest environment. But what specific context?,btohqsg
hello get can i know what card is good to pay for your bill at axs?,btohqsg
Hi  may I know what is a good UOB credit card to get in regards to the UOB savings account ?,btohqsg
Uob one card with one account I suppose,btohqsg
uob evol  uob lady  uob one all quite good depending on your spending pattern,btohqsg
if i spend more on contactless  and simply go - uob one should be better or hsbc revo?example ntuc cold storage retails like challenger nike appleshopee lazada amazon depend maybe $100 at least per monthholiday trip not for nowf&B with QR code for now i use  grab since after oct 14 stil can use but nerfgrab after 14 oct i still can use for utilty bill like SP genenco and mobile fibre bills since most card dont support utilityuob one i recall got some support on SP for utility,btohqsg
Hey I’m new to Citibank  what’s the best way to maximise?,btohqsg
I’m new to citi bank  what’s the best way to maximise? I want to sign up for citi plus too,btohqsg
HSBC revo doesn't reward for simply go  for your use case  UOB One does look better,btohqsg
Best way to maximize is to go tot.me/sgpromocodeand apply for the citi plus and citi credit card there,btohqsg
ya now i spend around 900ish per monthmaily on grab pay  - looking at a grab replacement due to grab cutting down on pointsto the followingF&B QR hawker $100 per monthntuc  - 500 max per monthshopee lazada - $100-200 max per monthutillty like SP geneco mobile fibre singtel m1 - around - $270 per monthsimply go - $100 max per monthcontactless spending is more due to ntuc and shopping from nike adidas challenger examplei have already got uob one accountoverseas trip depend maybe in future for airline tickets free and easy modeso u guys suggest i go for uob one card over hsbc revo or amex truecash back and citi cashback ?,btohqsg
UOB One has 1% on top of 3.33% for utilities... 10% for Shopee... 10% for simply GO... so your overall % will be higher based on your spending style,btohqsg
if not split into a few cards... Citi Cashback for 8% on grocery + miscellaneous since min spend $800,btohqsg
then UOB one for the other $500/mo,btohqsg
Citi Cashback+ or the Citi Cashback card?,btohqsg
Ok will look into the Citi Cashback card thx,btohqsg
For the uob one when is a best time to sign up likeend of the month? So can chalk up 3 month as I noticed it's every quarterLike now already Oct so I got 2 month More to chalk up the Total sum? Or it best I sign up end of December so can tap on Jan to march 2023 ?,btohqsg
Which card is good to pay for travel agency like Chang brothers or CTC?,btohqsg
first sign up is prorated... meaning if u spend 2mo of the Q they will credit 2/3 of the cashback,btohqsg
mean i still need to meet the min sum of $500 ?,btohqsg
Anyone has problem applying HSBC Revo Card? It has been 2mths already since I apply it thru online. I called SC but was told they have a lot of backlogs and ask to to wait till now no news at all.,btohqsg

Hey guys  I own CRMC  HSBC Revo  Citi PM and Amex card (1.5%)  was thinking whats the best way for me to pay for public transport which im doing it via Trust bank now cause.. all these dont earn much.Thinking whether to use Grab card for it too but then i don't like the fact that it overrides GPay and nope  cant apply for a card liao cause apply too much in recent months (recently kana deny),btohqsg
The miles only apply to you only  any other passenger milage will not be credit to you,btohqsg
if cannot apply credit card then maybe use ezlink simplygo card.https://www.ezlink.com.sg/simplygo-ezlink/10percent/no more 10% cashback but still have 4×$0.50 for topup,btohqsg
Hello all! What card is good to top up youtrip wallet? Thanks in advance!! 😊,btohqsg
Oh use grab pay card to top-up right?,btohqsg
The final coffin nail on grab would be if uob amex or amex truecadhback nerf grab top up,btohqsg

Hi anyone manage to receive tax refund on their YouTrip card before?,btohqsg
I just applied for amaze card after watching Chris' YouTube. But I m concern about using the card in JB as there's a lot feedback that there's issue on petrol and retail purchase. I planned to pair with Citi+ card for cashback.,btohqsg
T bill is the leading indicator for SSB to a certain extend... so if interest rates dropping it will be lower... and vice versa,btohqsg
what about the standard chartered smart credit card? that gives 6% or 5 mpd  seems decent. Or you can’t apply for that too?,btohqsg
i hope not… then no more gateway for amex which is a huge nerf on the absolut amex itself since almost no one in singapore accepts it,btohqsg
Bobian lo better than using grab I suppose 😂,btohqsg
If u have revolut u can try the hack tooUob amex>grab>revolut,btohqsg
Now I think about it actually could have stuck to Revolut tho no Cashback (earn via Amex > Grab > Revo),btohqsg
wouldn’t then just using regular 1.2mpd card be more valuable?,btohqsg
I think it have to do with the amount you are trying to top up. Just tried 10 dollar to youtrip from grab  it work,btohqsg
Don't have altitude (Citi PM excludes it)HSBC Revo earns .. 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
I heard cashing out will be a problem if top up this way tho so be careful,btohqsg
Large amount get rejected which is why have to play around with the amount to see which amount goes through for grab to revolut or grab to youtrip,btohqsg
I dont cash out often  i use for touch and go app to pay in malaysia,btohqsg
Revolut rate for ringgit is better then youtrip,btohqsg
citi premiermiles doesnt work for simplygo?,btohqsg
Tried again with $10  same issue. Maybe blacklisted haha,btohqsg
citibank exclude simplygo on all cards except citi smrt,btohqsg
Nope  excluded in Citi master list,btohqsg
oh that sucks… ill need a solution after sc ends their promotion too then..,btohqsg
Uob>grab> revolut will get rejected at time if the top up amount is too big  tried 1k unsucessful but 500 went through. Need to top up on different day,btohqsg
Was it paynow qr or by card?,btohqsg
i recently did the same top up method to buy some yen on revolut  topped up about 500 and it worked,btohqsg
Youtrip should be same issue  should be grab side rejecting the transaction,btohqsg
Hah ya the last nail to the coffins,btohqsg

Uob amex itself still have it's advantage for site that accept amex. It is 1.7 cashback highest among cashback card with the least exclusion,btohqsg
Goverment website take amex  hospital take amex,btohqsg
This is my hospital bill card to go to,btohqsg
the painful one is insurance premiums,btohqsg
AIA refuses to take anything except mastercard,btohqsg
That is because mastercard might be the cheapest among the card type,btohqsg
Visa fee is not cheap for merchant,btohqsg
yea i heard that too  and amex being the most exp,btohqsg
But visa card give more benefit,btohqsg
Look at almost cashback card is visa network,btohqsg
which is the only advantage that grab mastercard has now  acting as the proxy 🥲 just hoping uob doesnt exclude grab,btohqsg
It is a co relationship  uob nees grab grad need uob,btohqsg
Data can show uob what most user use uob amex on,btohqsg
hopefully  my heart is still trying to recover from the dbs nerf of instarem!,btohqsg
If uov amex nerf the grab  top up then time to move o.,btohqsg
Instarem might be nerf with other bank sooner or later  we shall see,btohqsg
I also looking at a replacmen,btohqsg

It really depend on individual spending habit to know which card suit,btohqsg

For those visiting malaysia frequently use the touch and go app,btohqsg

Just scan and pay like paylah or let merchant scan your qr,btohqsg
I dont bring much cash nowadays when i go malaysia,btohqsg
Just download app and brinf revolut card,btohqsg
Withdraw with revolut  there ia free withrawal limit i think,btohqsg
i like that part about revolut  it’s helpful for countries like japan which is still so cash based,btohqsg
Is the exchange rate good when withdrawing cash using revolut. I thought there is some charges,btohqsg
Havent try that  i usually bring small amt of cash  my phone and revolut to malaysia. Most place in jb take tng,btohqsg
Just have to ask the shop when u making payment,btohqsg
Ya used to tap Revolut in jp no issue at all,btohqsg
Random challenge with small reward that can ignore. More for the convi sake and safety,btohqsg
For petrol wise  tng offer voucher sales at discount for shell in malaysia,btohqsg
Can buy that to pump up petrol,btohqsg
Just read tnc carefully before purchasing voucher to use,btohqsg
Yeah  another convenience is for people to lock in (favorable?) SGD:MYR rates since YouTrip doesn't allow MYR in their wallet,btohqsg
Yes i top up on day with good rate,btohqsg
But revolut on weekends have additional charges  right?,btohqsg
I have try using the app in small town coffee shop etc  not just jb,btohqsg
U can top up first to tng on weekday,btohqsg
Usually midweek rate is better then monday or friday,btohqsg
I went to a small and non renovated home based restaurant on top of the hill 100m above sea level. The only payment accepted is Cash and T&G. The acceptance is far wider than I thought,btohqsg
Major supermarket take that too like aeon and econsave,btohqsg
TNG in Malaysia is becoming like our SG Grabpay everywhere,btohqsg
The best part  u get 1.7 percent from uob absolute. So it is favourable exchange rate plus cashback,btohqsg
No money changer can beat that,btohqsg
Acceptance is high as the money goes in the merchant account next day  faster then card. I would imagine tng charge low fee or no fee compare to credit card,btohqsg
just like china wechat i suppose so its acceptance is high,btohqsg
Yup but considering the fact that china still not very card orientated  only ppl that travel oversea have master or visa,btohqsg
long time didnt go malaysiaso now TNG can use on all payment in malaysia from retiails to F&B and trains in KL?,btohqsg
TNG top up got a app on mobile to top up by amex?,btohqsg
🤦‍♀ OOO SO many steps no wonder can take points from amex,btohqsg
those small kopitam shops sell food take TNG or pure cash still?,btohqsg
Depend on merchant  i would say 50/50,btohqsg
Even my dad pay for his fish purchase at market with tng,btohqsg
ya more then 10yr never go malaysia,btohqsg
The one he goes to deal with singaporean and big amt,btohqsg
It is really like sg if stallholder is elderly  most prob cash only. If there is youngster helping out then most have tng,btohqsg
ya expectedduno if the famous bukit bintang area the jalan alor accept TNG,btohqsg

Hm.. Hello  can someone share some insights as to why I should not mix investment and insurance tgt? I search online all I find was their high charges and fees. The ILP I am talking about is Pruvantage Assure.,btohqsg
Just paid my dad car road tax  discover an interesting payment option. So paypal was an payment option  meaning i dont have to go with the absolute amex>grab route. Instead  i just have to add my uob amex to the paypal and pay directly.,btohqsg
And  btw.. from what I have researched the usual ILP is that as we get older the monthly payment will get higher as for my this plan based on the agent I met she said I monthly $300 for 15 years. And I would also like to know what's your view on this plan. This is the very first policy I am thinking of buying by myself so I am very new to this. Thank you in advance for your views on this policy.,btohqsg
U alr found the ans. High charges and fees.,btohqsg
As an exfinancial adviser  i would seperate investment from insuranceReason beenInvesment flucuate  market can go down and upInsurance if for protection.While a hybrid of both sound like u get the best of both world but personally alot of my friend have to convert to other whole life limited pay policy (not sold by me) during 40 to 50 which they lost the advantage of low insurance fee when u buy insurance young,btohqsg
To achieve what an ilp too  all you have do to is buy whole life limited pay and do regular saving plan (investment in unit trust) seperately,btohqsg
Quick questions   does having 20+ referrals for an app counts as a lot? Any referral kings/queens here haha,btohqsg
Advantage of whole life limited pay is u pay the insurance for 15-25 year but coverage until 99.While ilp insurance fee increase as u age and it seem cheap when young it does get very expensive when u age.,btohqsg
Alternative buy term and invest the rest will do the job too,btohqsg
To be honest  agent recommend hybid product as the commission is very lucrativr,btohqsg
moneyowl ceo  providend ceo both were ex insurance agent too  and both thinks ILP are terrible product lol,btohqsg
It take a great mathematician to figure out their fees. They can anyhow charge you fees also you don't know. By end of 10 to 20 years. Even if the funds it purchase went up a lot. Your insurance may only have same value as your capital input. And this is the best case scenario. So worse case scenario? And the spread between buy and sell of ilps is huge. Almost 5 to 10%. [as far as I remember when my relatives show me],btohqsg
Fee is not the scary part  it is increasing for sure that is a know fact. The scary part is the investment performance  it just eat away your capital if it dont perform,btohqsg

Message from Syfe Trade: Sep 2022Get $70 Cash credits when you sign up for Syfe Tradehttps://www.syfe.comwith my code: HONEYMONEYSeptember is usually a volatile month historically  and this month was no different. US stocks have fallen for three consecutive quarters so far  the first time since the Great Financial Crisis. The S&P 500 ended 9.3% lower  with year to date losses close to 25%. The Dow dropped 8.8% while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 10.5%.Are equity markets forward looking?Three consecutive quarters of declines is tough to stomach. Have equity bear markets predicted a recession in the past? According to Bloomberg  markets are not as prescient or forward-looking as one might expect. Looking at 5 recessions in the last 40 years or so:In 2020  the S&P 500 peaked in February  the same month the recession beganIn 2007  the market peaked in October  two months before the recession started in DecemberIn 2001  the recession began in March. But equities had already peaked a year earlier in March of 2000In 1990  the recession began in July  the same month the S&P 500 peakedThe S&P 500 peaked in November of 1980  whereas you had to wait until July of 1981 for the second peak in the economy’s double dip recessionBefore or even after a recession ends  trying to pinpoint when equity markets turn positively is understandably extremely difficult.Markets go up and down  as investors we hope for gains but should be prepared for falls too. History tells us that markets turn positive over the long term and investors who adopt a dollar cost averaging (DCA) strategy do better over the long run. On Syfe Trade  the recurring buy feature enables investors to automatically invest in a particular stock or ETF every week or month  taking timing out of the equation.,btohqsg

they have $0 in their CPF  however my dad has already passed the age of 65,btohqsg
from my understanding  a top up of $30 000 to his RSTU account will gain 6% interest? it will then pay out with $250/mth until the sum runs out right? can he withdraw the $30 000 with interest lump sum  if say he has urgent need for the money,btohqsg
They will chopped only at whenever the fairprice you redeemed voucher at. So where u redeem will be where you have to use.,btohqsg
Imagine if dbs is mentioned it because chris mentioned him thinking dbs really watches the video (which i think they are) 😂,btohqsg

Dear credit card experts  if you have to leave Singapore and stay overseas for a minimum of 2-3 years. which credit card will you choose and how will you maximize the benefits of either the mileage or cashback programs?Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!,btohqsg
use Amaze... CC depends on your usage patterns... i think Maybank F&F is good for cashback.. miles should be the standard just get 4x miles for online spend,btohqsg
Hi all  I saw some messages to use Amex > grab for insurance premiums. Is this only for 1st installment payment? Coz my insurance agent all told me that I cant use grabpay or credit cards for recurring insurance premiums payment. Seek some clarity and advise pls.,btohqsg
Need to pay manually. I pay for 2 mths at 1 go. for prudential.,btohqsg
If me I might apply the overseas CC and focus on cashback.,btohqsg
Hey  can I know how to maximize miles to have the equivalent to 5-6% cashback?,btohqsg
I thought about this before. My plan is to use miles card so that I can redeem ticket home whenever possible.,btohqsg
Grab card can be use at axs,btohqsg
Accumulate and then sell to other by booking flight for them,btohqsg
Sia give bonus miles at time for redemption,btohqsg
Oh so its to pay thru AXS using grabpay,btohqsg
Ok tks  will go and try it out,btohqsg
agreeed those beneifts is those very very low income,btohqsg
eh... for HDB BTO this one no hack right 😂,btohqsg
You can ask the HDB officer if they let you tap NETS Flashpay $500 per card,btohqsg
What card do you use to top up the flashpay?,btohqsg
Oh...but how do you top FP via CC?,btohqsg
Hey guys does instarem amaze + Citi rewards work with Kris+?Meaning we can earn up to 4 + 9 miles per dollar,btohqsg
hi  i have an online purchase of about USD 1k (overseas website)  is the citibank cashback+ 1.6% & amaze bonus 1% the best way to transact this?,btohqsg
maybe  unless it is under a mcc that get higher rewards on specialised cards,btohqsg
i see. Also realised that the amaze with fx spread of 0.3%  and if instapoints capped at 500 points/transaction (i cant split my USD 1.1k/roughly SGD 1.5k so effectively bonus cashback is only about 0.33%)  basically my bonus cashback is nullified  correct? 😅,btohqsg
Check out the Kris+ app  basically u pay with Google Pay on it so u earn miles on ur card AND on the Kris+ app itself,btohqsg
I don't think its 4MPD.. Other chats have recommended using HSBC revolution on it tho,btohqsg
Can explain more why it will not earn 4mpd? I've read very differing views on this also,btohqsg
I don't think there's a definite answer out there for amaze since there's mixed answers from what I've been observing  but at least using CRMC directly  won't provide u w 4mpdhttps://milelion.com/2022/10/09/krisshop-10-10-deal-earn-up-to-14-5-mpd-on-all-purchases/,btohqsg
think kris data base got hacked ?https://www.marketing-interactive.com/krisshop-phishing-data-breachafter u google seem like happen quitte often,btohqsg
because you will not earn anything on CRMC if you make payments through Google/ApplePay. using amaze does not bypass that fact.Since Kris+ only accepts payment through Google/ApplePay.... hence it won't get the 4mpd,btohqsg
Have anyone tried to use youtrip or revolut on axs payment before?,btohqsg
Any suggestions for retail transaction to hit min spend of $500 on citibank cashback + card  i have to spend a few hundred before the time limit is up in a few days.,btohqsg
What are some types of vouchers i can get?,btohqsg
Amaze bypass that and can get 4mpd,btohqsg
at least u save on fx fees and still get 1.6%,btohqsg
Really? I was told that I can't put amaze+crmc on Google pay becuz it won't bypass. Have been avoiding it cuz ive see multiple advices on this,btohqsg
Hi gurus  quite new to this credit card stacking thing. Anyone uses the ezlink Mastercard? Is it good? I’m currently using Citibank cashback+ cos I’m a low spender and don’t always hit the $500 in monthly spending.,btohqsg
CRMC need to avoid in-app apple/google payAmaze on google pay is ok because the google pay is outside of the Amaze App.CRMC on Kris+ is not ok because the google pay is in Kris+ app.Does that make it clearer?,btohqsg
Right ok thanks all... Cuz I've always been told amaze doesn't bypass Google pay issue for crmc,btohqsg

Most go online Amazon shoppee or in store,btohqsg
May I know the annual credit card fee. Usually if u call in they will waive for you or is there any condition,btohqsg
I think in terms of Cashback and fuss free  probably this is still quite a good combo after nerf.Grab will just become a proxy for Amex. Since it is more widely accepted & you can still pay some of the bills via grab on axs,btohqsg
So far Citibank has been quite good in terms of waiver.Call in and request the waiver. They are quite ready to waive,btohqsg
Planning to apply Citi Rewards Credit Card as my first Credit Card. The min 30k income is nett income or including cpf?,btohqsg

Yeah why not. Covers most stuff with Amaze card. Also got it for my first card.,btohqsg
What did u get as second card,btohqsg
SC unlimited back in 2021  followed by Amex tcb. I'm a casual spender haha.,btohqsg
@oaksticthis is what I found out...https://t.me/sethisfychat/62548,btohqsg
Anyone had used the Instarem Amaze card overseas? Would the user be able to know the conversion rate before transacting?,btohqsg
Anyone test use grab top up to dash work ?,btohqsg
Mostly no condition if you use it regularly,btohqsg
Yes based on tnc. But don't quote me as im not uob,btohqsg
means can top up to grab and consider as 1200 spend right,btohqsg
yea i will still call them tmr to double confirm,btohqsg
I feel that the days of CRMC with Amaze are already numbered sigh,btohqsg
But grabpay top still got 1.7%,btohqsg
hi guys  am just starting the miles game. gonna be applying for the citi rewards card.should i apply through singsaver or apply straight from citibank?,btohqsg

sweet! is it not wise to opt for the $600 hair dryer?,btohqsg
i just discovered your videos  really informative. thank you so much!,btohqsg
Sure  no problem if you do Prefer the hair dryer,btohqsg
I'm trying to figure that out as well. Do you have credit/debit card topups disabled on dash?,btohqsg
I have SC Jumpstart card. Since topup to Singtel Dash will charge $1 fee  I'm trying to work out if I can use Grab to get around the fee by topping up my card to Grab then transfer the balance to Dash,btohqsg
Recall last time try grab not successful,btohqsg
Gonna try again on weekends see how,btohqsg
hmm did someone tag me? 😅,btohqsg
I tot they stop grab topup for dash,btohqsg
Mine not successful either. Probably because I don't have PayNow transfer out enabled?,btohqsg
I try this method long ago,btohqsg
Since when can use card topup dash,btohqsg
Grab does advertise that they allow topups to Dash  Liquid  MatchMove and Wise,btohqsg
can  I used it last time before. Used to be free  now they charge $1 fee per topup,btohqsg
If you use debit card to topup to Grab it'll go into transferrable balance,btohqsg
If charge $1 then not Worth,btohqsg
card>dash will charge $1card>grab no chargesso if we can do card>grab>dash then we can get around the $1 fee,btohqsg
Hi does anyone know when Revolut 20% cashback will be credited?,btohqsg
Interesting I check top up by credit it stated $1 fee,btohqsg
correct  credit or debit card topup will charge $1 fee,btohqsg
but what I'm asking is if it's possible to use Grab to topup Dash through their transfer to e-wallet feature so that I can bypass the $1 fee,btohqsg
transfer via e-wallet btw  grab blocks dash paynow qr codes,btohqsg
Can some gurus pls advise. I achieved the Grab Challenge for reward points  and through the process i have top up $ to Grabpay via PayNow VPA method. Question is can i transfer back the top up to my bank  once i gotten the reward points?,btohqsg
But you have to register PayNow on Dash,btohqsg
"so from Dash app tap ""send money"" then ""PayNow""",btohqsg
then the app will ask you to register for PayNow  complete the registration then you'll be able to add dash mobile number to Grab,btohqsg
however once you do so you cannot topup by credit or debit card to dash anymore,btohqsg
not that it matters since they charge $1 for that now,btohqsg
Can't undo this method once u enroll?,btohqsg
can you withdraw back to bank account if using Grab to top up to Dash?,btohqsg
but tbh the only change is that you can't topup to dash by credit/debit card anymore  which doesn't matter since1. you can still topup by debit card using grab as a proxy2. dash charges $1 for card topups anyway,btohqsg
Use debit then olmo use hahahaha,btohqsg
This works  but minimum amount $2,btohqsg
1.2% back in dash points  can be used to redeem store vouchers,btohqsg
anyone has an idea TPG/SIMBA recharge in-app counts as what MCC? Isit telco or wallet topup? 😬,btohqsg
Just top up via qoo10 or shopee got better discount,btohqsg
GrabWallet via FavePay for Hawker Centre food purchase  still earns you grab points 😅$4.8 = 27 points,btohqsg
No diff if you use debit card or bank account transfer ma?,btohqsg
Why don't just direct topup bank account to dash?,btohqsg
Transferable grab balance all comes from bank acc / debit card,btohqsg
Thinking most wanna double or triple dip to earn Cashback,btohqsg
Dont understand  max cashback is dash 1.2%,btohqsg
SC jumpstart debit card gives 1% cashback on grab wallet topups,btohqsg
that's why I ask if can transfer grab balance to dash,btohqsg
which I just found out is possible,btohqsg
I've done that since i opened my account  it's always worked,btohqsg
But tio caught then they might ban you,btohqsg
SC jumpstart card cashback has a max of $60 per month tho,btohqsg
Quite a huge risk for extra 1% cashback,btohqsg
didn't realise that  yeah I think I'll stop doing it,btohqsg
Just Tested grab QR for hawker stukk got point duno if tomorrow is gonna nerf,btohqsg
or did you get the mystery box?,btohqsg
I buy liho yesterday and scan QR code I got 34 points,btohqsg
Grab already say you to 25kSo zero still a number,btohqsg
If amex & grab removed the top up scheme it's a nail to coffin,btohqsg
It will be gg for my extra spending,btohqsg
Im doing evol 6% for first 600And uob amex > grab > cdc total 3.7% for next 1750 spending,btohqsg
ohhh no points for Grab to CDC no?,btohqsg
Ya  uob amex 1.7% + 2% cdc,btohqsg
Which tier are you on? I was on blue tier but they didn't give rewards anymore so I cancelled my card,btohqsg
12pts is like the highest i ever seen so far lol,btohqsg
If you buy fraser voucher using grab  you get grab pts,btohqsg
So for this promo  you spend $50 topup grab  buy $60 fraser voucher,btohqsg
Get 300 grab points and 1.7% cashback uob amex,btohqsg
why u got boxes? i still getting points from shopee,btohqsg

ALERT: Grab Rewards 20% off again for those who missed last round!,btohqsg
hi  currently the best way to topup youtrip is still amex tcb/uob absolute + grabpay? Topups to youtrip from other credit cards wont qualify for cashback correct?,btohqsg
If you all see it earlier than me can sound out too! Will credit to you on@HMSGHive,btohqsg

"Have used it before  not very difficult  at home page click ""transfer""  then ""duitnow"" then fill in account number and bank. If details are name name will appear at the next pageIf you deposited funds into GO+ to earn daily returns  you need withdraw from GO+ first before you can do the transfer",btohqsg
If one has CIMB accounts on both sides of the causeway  CIMB is usually better and can transfer larger amounts (TNG limited to max MYR 25k/month and occasionally will have top up issues  Revolut is also subject to 30k annual limit and this will reduce your ability to do other fcy txns). But rates are best only on Mon - Fri  usually 9am to 5pm and excluding PH. Non-residents of Malaysia are also subject to BNM's FEA rules and can only move MYR 10k / day.To pre-check on rates:https://www.cimbclicks.com.sg/sgd-to-myr,btohqsg
I use uob>grab>revolut so have the 1.7 percent spread,btohqsg
Wont be over 25k lol  just casual user,btohqsg
But thank for the advice  good to know,btohqsg
Do u know how long is the transfer process,btohqsg
instant  duitnow is Malaysia's version of PayNow,btohqsg
So faster then cimb sg to cimb malaysia?,btohqsg
but duitnow combines our PayNow + FAST (so you can duitnow to their phone number / mykad  but also duitnow to a bank acc),btohqsg
so it boils down to rates / cashback / convenience,btohqsg
for hsbc revo  anyone can confirm if skyscanner ortrip.comfalls under MCC code 4722 (travel agencies and tour operators)? Thanks!,btohqsg

can ah why not.. been doing this for years,btohqsg
GO+ only for purely malaysians.. not applicable for SG citizen unless you are PR from Msia,btohqsg
Just did a top up to TNG Comparison 10RMInstarem - $3.11 (Rate 3.2154)Revolut - $3.04 (Rate 3.292)Youtrip - $3.08 (Rate 3.2467)Seems like even though i use instarem and pay $3.11 and get 4MPD.This 4MPD will be equivalent to $0.07(12miles).Therefore 1 Mile = $0.00583Is it worth it ?,btohqsg
Youtrip to touch and go app,btohqsg
U can store ringgit in the app,btohqsg
Which card u pair with to get 4MPD on TnG,btohqsg
Ohhhh  btw anyone have the ez link debit wallet acc?if have do y’all know how to withdraw money from there to other platform like grab or etc,btohqsg
I not sure if the foreign currency fee is worth it,btohqsg
Oh but confirm eligible spend huh.. whats the MCC? Because I know TnG mcc can be random at times,btohqsg
I dont have to worry with mcc that way,btohqsg
And i get 1.7 percent cashback on my top up,btohqsg
MCC 4784: Toll and Bridge Fees,btohqsg
Because there are like 3-4 MCCs for tng,btohqsg
With 3.29 rate (today) i get extra 1.7 percent which is extra 5 ringgit,btohqsg
most of my top up is 4784,btohqsg
So the effective rate become 1 sgd to 3.34,btohqsg
I think this is more attractive me then miles,btohqsg
Some prefer milesSome prefer cashbackSee whats your valuation :),btohqsg
My miles card burst every month lol as i use for side biz,btohqsg
Technically.. 4MPD is a tad better than 1.7% cashback,btohqsg
Its about 2.5% cashback worth for 4MPD,btohqsg
There is foreign currency fee by bank,btohqsg
That window might not stay that long,btohqsg
not for years down the road.. what makes u feel Amex and Grab will be in to stay for long also? hehe,btohqsg
It is a corelation between amex and grab,btohqsg
i hope it lasts of course :) i'm highly dependent on it lol..,btohqsg
But actually my spread last time was more when jipay was functional,btohqsg
ezlink cannot transfer to revo / grab / grab anymoreotherwise that was my best option,btohqsg
From uob amex>grab>jipay (during7-10 percent booster)>revolut>tng,btohqsg
if u add ezlink between jipay and revolut  you would have earned more during those times,btohqsg
Jipay nerf those ezlink top up cashback,btohqsg
but issue now is ezlink cannot > revo / grab / youtrip anymore also,btohqsg
Only valid for like 2 month then program die,btohqsg
Lucky i din put alot in ezlink,btohqsg
Loophole are shortlive  like i say company look at data,btohqsg
basically ezlink now i dont think got any simple exit other than spending it genuinely,btohqsg
Top up to expiring ezlink to cash out,btohqsg
That is what been done by other in the past to churn,btohqsg
i dont have any $ stuck in it so still fine for now.. just sad they suddenly stop allowing topup to revo / youtrip etc.,btohqsg
U dont get any extra point from using ezlink to revolut and youtrip right,btohqsg
I only top up to ezlink wallet when they run the cashback promotion,btohqsg
i got card giving me rewards topping up ezlink,btohqsg
U still keep cro coin in stake? Must lost more than the cashback.,btohqsg
never stake cant get any 'cryptoback',btohqsg
I think most sg use visa mastercard or amex,btohqsg
I hold some unionpay card which give 2.5 percent cashback it self although with cap but no minimum spend,btohqsg
Unionpay like amex does push out offer at time to gain signup,btohqsg
Hi just to confirm  gpmc + uob absolute still give total 2.9% for online shopping right,btohqsg
Is just the retail getting nerfed,btohqsg
If u use grabpay card it is nerf,btohqsg
If u use grabpay online it is still same,btohqsg
Grabpay card mean u go through the mastercard processing route grabpay online is directly with grabpay icon at payment page,btohqsg
Grab pay use it to pay tax,btohqsg
I don't think I've ever used the physical grab card since I got it the past 2 months,btohqsg
In fact I don't even bring it out  just scan qr at local stores  then use it for online shopping or topup to revolut,btohqsg
If u need to key in the card number at check out it is grabpay card. Those that ask u to login to grab pay account using hp number is grabpay online,btohqsg
Just tested grab on retial no points Liao,btohqsg
I sell before at about usd$0.40 don't want to 因小失大. I think the cashback you earn cannot be recovered back to capital.,btohqsg
Just did a takeshimaya purchase with grab also bo point,btohqsg

Let see if grab challenge change at midnighy,btohqsg
Guess if grab challenge still work then the best option is 1.7 plus 2 percent,btohqsg
qR I use on hawkers grab still ok,btohqsg

Hi everyone  I do have another enquiry regarding expenditure in Msia. Intending to sign a photography package costing about RM 5000. In that regard  would Instrarem Amaze with Citi cashback be the best option?,btohqsg

Noted on that. Will see if the merchant agrees to that.,btohqsg

Hi guys another question I have a purchase that is ~$3600. I have the citi rewards card with amaze but I understand that the 4mpd is capped at first $1000.Can I just check what’s the best way to maximise this $3600 spend?,btohqsg
are you using the SingPass automated application?(1) can try using the manual submission of documents(2) or apply as secured card (means you put a fixed deposit amount with them amounting to your spending limit),btohqsg
I will try to do manually,btohqsg
(1) check with the vendor whether you can split the purchasefor example  if you’re buying fromAmazon.sgfirst 1K can be done withAmazon.sggiftcards. Subsequent 2.6K use a general spending card.(2) check if the purchase is eligible for bonus 10X under OCBC TR(3) use a general spending card. Citi Premiermiles  UOB PRVI  etc.(4) apply a new credit card and use this $3.6K to hit the spending requirement for welcome bonus,btohqsg
What is the value of each HSBC reward point?,btohqsg
