for what? as if they'll go back and redesign it,btohqsg
unless enough people email them to make a manual levorg,btohqsg
4.7k of us all email them,btohqsg
If this was Pete or mr X,btohqsg
I would've reported that message already,btohqsg
Might want to be careful with assumptions sir,btohqsg
anyway i'm entitled to my opinion against CVT  don't like it,btohqsg
yeah their cvt alr not bad,btohqsg
The lineartronic CVT can feel the gear change one .. I love it üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I think I can survive 180,btohqsg
Tasty but deep down you know it's a scam,btohqsg
Tasty but deep down you know it‚Äôs a scam,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs a scam leh,btohqsg
Erm  upbadging is more like halal pork. Completely fake,btohqsg
Maybe that was from very early cvt you tried (or you owned a cvt before?). Maybe now their cvts are actually good leh otherwise how to compete in that hot space,btohqsg
So truffle fries still better than them,btohqsg
If the whole group order it I'll still eat la. But obviously won't order it for myself,btohqsg
The ‚ÄúI cannot find it in the dark‚Äù face?,btohqsg
No it‚Äôs the ‚Äúis it in?‚Äù face,btohqsg
This discussion is going weird places,btohqsg
I thought we‚Äôd talking about the cvt gearshift,btohqsg
My rickshaw redline already at 20kph anyway,btohqsg
BMW on a rampage in PRC,btohqsg
A 22-year-old man in Guangzhou  China went on a rampage & drove his BMW into crowds. He killed 5 & injured 13.‚û°Ô∏èhttp://bit.ly/3X7L04rFollow us on@mothershipsgfor the latest updates,btohqsg
Just got this in the mail,btohqsg
Yall sleeping on lalamove and sinopec,btohqsg
Or more better. Go JB woohooo!,btohqsg
Go with 3/4 tank come back 4/4 tank,btohqsg
Got it too. But I don't use Caltex. Anyone interested?,btohqsg
Better if you download caltex app and use ocbc,btohqsg
Must use ocbc credit card right for that,btohqsg
Why leh? Not good or u use 97 alr HAHA,btohqsg
M-sport not consider upbadge la. It‚Äôs a trim level mah. Just like amg line. Factory labelled,btohqsg
Sometimes dealers also don‚Äôt know the difference,btohqsg
Exactly  misleading. Not upbadge per se but still is a low spec car made to look like it is not,btohqsg
But there is actual truffle taste!!!!,btohqsg
Why you keep bullying poor truffle fries,btohqsg
I don't mind truffle fries  but it's just truffle oil,btohqsg
Like special trim  is only body kit,btohqsg
no one even says there is real truffle bits in it lor!,btohqsg
No hor.. some got special stitch and badge in cabin also,btohqsg
Does it change the driving experience?,btohqsg
Like putting stripes on bonnet  roof and body,btohqsg
But it's dumb for those that know the difference,btohqsg
Or black/CF look alike wrap on roof,btohqsg
Is like pumping vpower racing in vios,btohqsg
You drive around see so many owners wrap the roof black to look like CF roof,btohqsg
Or the cerato or fit with fake quad pipes  but the stock exhaust still visible,btohqsg
Maybe it does improve the engine in vios also leh?,btohqsg
To me it‚Äôs like how people like to wear pretty clothes. To make them look better even though face or inside body also same,btohqsg
