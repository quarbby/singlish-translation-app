Hi Gurus  for big ticket appliances such as aircon and fridge  furnitures etc  which credit card would be better for interest-free instalments and also get cashback at the same time? I also see some cards must have minimum spend of$Xto be eligible for X% of cashback or mpd  would instalments qualify too?,btohqsg
Instalment usually won't earn rewards unless special promo,btohqsg
Finally got back my USDT from ftx.,btohqsg
Hey gurus  do ya‚Äôll have any reccs on what cc to use for travel bookings such as flight tiks  accoms from klook  agoda etc? Hoping to set the uob lady‚Äôs category as dining permanently since the switching of category is a little troublesome‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Then you need something like dbs woman world mastercard,btohqsg
Suggest u use Lady for travel related. If can have solitaire will be better.Use Amaze + CRMC for your non travel related expenses.,btohqsg

"For personal income tax filing this year  if after claiming all reliefs one is entitled to; 2024 assessable income is 30k  means the $200 tax payable will be ""waived"" because of the personal income tax rebate of 60%  capped at $200  is this understanding correct ?",btohqsg
Check the DBS 3 months instalment promo. Valid till 28/2,btohqsg
Hi gurus  possible to advise if payment via Fairprice app using Maybank friends&family card has the 8% cashback been nerfed?cuz recently I noticed Singtel app has been nerfed,btohqsg
No. If after reliefs  your assessable income is $30k  your tax payable is $200. With the 60% rebate  your final tax payable is $80.,btohqsg
Does Assessable Income (AI) consists of CPF?,btohqsg
If I set up SRS account and put $15 300  do I need to inform Iras or they will auto detect my srs contribution and apply the tax relief for me ?,btohqsg
CPF contributions is calculated as part of relief.,btohqsg
wait sorry I don‚Äôt get it.. from what I heard & saw  CPF contributions made by the employer to the employee's CPF account are generally taxable when these are voluntary contributions. Compulsory CPF contributions on the other hand are generally not taxable.,btohqsg
Ohhh so to calculate my AI  just gross income minus compulsory cpf contributions?,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone knows what will happen to the 90¬∫N miles if I decided to cancel the card?,btohqsg
Can check using the Maybank Treats app. Under benefit optimiser. For me  my recent purchases using FP app is still clocking the 8%.,btohqsg
can pay on singtel website  still get 8% under telco,btohqsg
seems like capitaland vouchers removed from wogi üò•,btohqsg
1. no2. because payment on Singtel app is not telco mcc,btohqsg
Hi Chris  I have tried on other funds. But it says threshold not reached,btohqsg
Share which funds  have your tried,btohqsg
Just do what is suitable for your risk level,btohqsg
HSBC GIF Ultra short duration bonds,btohqsg

Hi there  can I check if I use CRMC X Amaze for dental treatment (MCC: 8021) will be entitled Citi points?,btohqsg
Am I required to withdraw from my existing cash plus funds and subscribe to the new funds?,btohqsg
Yes different treatment for compulsory vs voluntary.,btohqsg
Cash plus funds do not work for 1.8%You need a new subscription which you may either deposit new funds  or redeem your existing cash positions.Please refer to the t&cs of how the coupon works again,btohqsg
If you are using FP app to pay for NTUC groceries  no issues always 8%. If you use FP app to pay Kopitiam foodcourt  then No,btohqsg
What I meant is employer giving extra (voluntary) contributions.Because both employer n employee can do separate independent voluntary contributions.,btohqsg
For qualifying spending on simplyGo  I just need to add my credit cards to the SimplyGo apps?,btohqsg
just tap the card (physical card or mobile wallet) for mrt/bus. Adding to Simplygo is optional  but good to have to check transactions and request refund (if applicable)Qualify for rewards/cashback or not depends on card TnC.,btohqsg
Correct. It would be gone. Do miles redemption. Wait for miles to be credited to KF. Pay the miles redemption fees and outstanding balance of the card. Lastly  call ocbc to initiate cancellation.,btohqsg
