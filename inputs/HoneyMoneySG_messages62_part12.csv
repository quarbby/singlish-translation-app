Hi guys  I just applied for my citirewards card and it arrived today. The expiry is 3 years only? It‚Äôs 08/26 not 08/28Is this normal for CRMC?,btohqsg
I'm sure it's the other way. Register first then deposit.,btohqsg
Incremental Fresh Funds are measured against your Eligible Account‚Äôs day-end balance as at 30 June 2023.https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/promotion/casapromo.page,btohqsg
"So that you can make it look like it has ""increased"" as the amount the snapshot of your initial account value is based the last day of the month. Correct me if I'm wrong.As above ^",btohqsg
Based on that  I guess technically can deposit now (since its after 30th June) then register after^Unconfirmed  please don't take this as a fact,btohqsg
No it's not as stated in the t&c.,btohqsg
The important note is across all UOB accounts  so make sure the funds were previously withdrawn out from UOB...,btohqsg
Separately  anyone has promo code for Citi pay all?,btohqsg
means i empty my balance before that day and add $100k in as fresh amount 1 minute after that day? üòÇ,btohqsg
Correct. Empty meaning you transfer out of UOB also,btohqsg
"Hi  trying to find out for UOB One $500 payment.  So  any insurance payment is ok with the following from their website?  How about MRT / bus?  - ""What is considered ELIGIBLE Card Spend transactions to fulfill bonus interest on One Account?Eligible Card spend transactions are based on the followinga. Eligible Visa/MasterCard local and foreign retail transactions subjected to the exclusionsmentioned below;b. Insurance payments made on a recurring basis on selected credit or debit cards""",btohqsg
I remember it is stated in the TnC.,btohqsg
Prudential insurance can link to deduct from UOB one card and is eligible as part of $500 payment cos that is what I‚Äôm doing now,btohqsg
So many different cards and will need to look into which is best.  ;-),btohqsg
Remember it's only for the $500 spending requirement for UOB One Account and not the cards.,btohqsg
Sorry  what is the difference?  $500 Giro/paynow etc?,btohqsg
Hi  Can DCS master credit card annual fee be waived?,btohqsg

BEST Credit Cards for SimplyGo Bus & MRT Rides 2023https://youtu.be/mBV7dZ4l3qM,btohqsg
But DCC is related to foreign currency,btohqsg
Then is DCS worth to get for the 2% cashback?,btohqsg
I got questionFor simply go appAll I do is link my credit card to the app?But when I tap on board  it's paying with my Google wallet on my phone with the same credit card details linked to the simplygo and my Google walletDoes it work that way? Or have I done it wrongly?,btohqsg
Yep pust pay with your card linked to your google wallet. The app is just to track the cost of each trip.,btohqsg
I mean diners club master credit card,btohqsg
Which means the rewards or rebates will be automatically tracked from my simplygo app as well?,btohqsg
Very sad. Maybank just rejected my CC application lol. Probably because I just got my UOB EVOL card approved last month. ü•≤,btohqsg
Oh why rejected?  As long as u  have the minimum salary.. bank will approve,btohqsg
Lol. It tracks the cost of the trip as mentioned above. You don't need to download it if you don't want to. The actual reason why I have it is actually to just make claims in the event I use a different device to tap out or if the reader can't read when I tap out.,btohqsg
Hi can I check whether paying utilities using theUOB One Debit Mastercardwill count towards fulfilling the $500 requirement? I checked the T&C and it doesn't seem to be excluded but I don't know why the payment isn't showing as counting toward the $500 requirement. Thanks!,btohqsg
Most likely because of my UOB EVOL card approval in end Jul.. or maybe because I got some outstanding payment on my DBS cards. ü§™They give me consolation prize of my free credit report from credit bureau.,btohqsg
Your transactions need to be posted first in your account  then take another up to 48 hours to update the tracker excluding weekend.,btohqsg
Does UOB take very long to send out credit cards?,btohqsg
Took abt 1.5 wks for me  after receiving the sms notification that my card has been approved,btohqsg
Ok earmark done and cash bonus credited. (I signed up on 1st July).,btohqsg
soo u called and they earmark for u?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think so. It‚Äôs just assurance it‚Äôs being handled,btohqsg
Wow what is this promo can still sign up now?,btohqsg
oh i see  maybe i'll call up tmr to check,btohqsg
Anyone calculated earmarked interests is how much more interest rates?,btohqsg
For $100 000 from 1st July 2023 locked till 15th November 2023 (4.5 months):Interest = 100 000 * 0.05 / 12 * 4.5 = $1 875Cash Gift = $558Total Benefit = 1 875 + 558 = $2 433$2 433 / 4.5 * 12 / 100 000 = 6.488% p.a. total benefit on $100 000 for 4.5 months lock up.,btohqsg
Can fight with rhb previously godly promo..,btohqsg
Still can make it I believe,btohqsg
This is assuming 5% stays lol,btohqsg
Usually the big banks cut will give 1-2 months notice,btohqsg
i don't think they will cut it while this campaign is ongoing.,btohqsg
Hi everyone - novice questionCan u link up Citi rewards with Instarem  convert transactions to online spend and do this for Singapore based transactions or is it only applicable for foreign oversees transactions ?,btohqsg
They are already giving by far the highest rates amongst all local banks  with the nearest competitor having rates a full percentage point or more lower than them. I'd expect rate cuts to come anytime.,btohqsg
Uob one is ‚Äúon par‚Äù with ocbc 360. 5% vs 4.65% respectively for salary/save/spend criteria.,btohqsg
Slightly la. But not enough to say they are over paying so will cut rates anytime soon.,btohqsg
"with promo it is 6.488%  better CC benefits  easier to meet salary crediting  no need ""save"" component",btohqsg
