Don't subscribe  your rghts will lapse and you only have existing shares where you can sell,btohqsg
I think bro furion say this,btohqsg
Ohh ok.   Cos I see 1400 share average down like not much,btohqsg
So if I own say $10 000 I am entitled to subscribe $700 for the rights,btohqsg
Yea number of shares. Yesterday I bought I think 0.245 and 40lots,btohqsg
Noted bro .. thank you üôè,btohqsg
If only 7% it's like not getting much funding? And fees for the rights issue would be cheaper than bank loan?,btohqsg
Bro do we cal base on 7% X 0.2 + 100% X 0.245 divide by 107%?,btohqsg
With enough floatThey can be tradedUnless specify non-remouncable,btohqsg
Remove all the % for easy calculation,btohqsg
U get 7 share at 20 centU got 100 share at 24.5What‚Äôs your avg,btohqsg
After subscribe to rights my average Willbe 0.247,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need pin too much hope on excess. Maybe few hundred shares more. Only increasing float by 7%,btohqsg
How will price react tomorrow ?,btohqsg
If not efficient rights issue means higher cost than take loan?,btohqsg
Yup dilution is very little.But if they want shareholders to fork out more. They will need to incentivise by maintaining or pumping it up so more shareholders will subscribe,btohqsg
So this rights issue purpose is hard to understand why? üòÇ,btohqsg
