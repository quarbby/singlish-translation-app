I just use it as it is since I already earn mile from the credit card.,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt remember. Maybe I did link to wallet or change to another card afterward.,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ü§£ then you have to find out which merchant allow you to refund to wallet... But this is technically a hack so you might get flagged by merchants or amaze themselves.,btohqsg

If I set a recurring payment to amaze + credit card  but I have more than one linked card w amaze  does the monthly deduction use the same linked card all the time or I need to take note of the deduction date and toggle the card to be used in amaze app accordingly ?,btohqsg
It will charge to whatever card that is linked at the point of deduction.,btohqsg
Yes it is dependent on whether it isReversalRefundOriginal creditI can tell u I honestly don‚Äôt understand 100% but can only say different merchants handle different.,btohqsg

better for what use case ?,btohqsg
Hi guys  is using citipayall for insurance etc worth it?Or is there a better platform for citi cards to pay for insurance?,btohqsg
Is my first time getting a credit card for earning miles. My huge payment is insurance and carloan which i know both can use cardup to make pymt,btohqsg
Same  trying to find the best wawayy to,btohqsg
I see citipayall is 2.2 or something,btohqsg
Oh  citipayall can use to pay insurance?,btohqsg
Yup  same have fees. But I hate how their website have the lack of transparency of showing how much is the fee. Keep trying to find it but can‚Äôt. Then I rmb seeing it somewhere to be 2.2% but I can‚Äôt be 100% sure.,btohqsg
Discussed about citi payall here and relevant cost vs benefits.Will be doing an insurance version soonhttps://youtu.be/B3zlAL32UY8?si=B12mG7OKmgXtwhwr,btohqsg
Ohokay  so which one are recommended citi premier or ocbc 90‚Å∞N,btohqsg
Both are fine. If you're clocking for ocbc 360 account interest then 90n,btohqsg
Great video. But the 3 card introduced for cardup/ipaymy miles will expired. Can introduce CC that miles will no expire üòÅüôè,btohqsg
Anyone knows if Webull USD deposit has any fx charges from SGD to USD? For new welcome signups,btohqsg
I have 2 cards that miles dun expire.1. DBS altitude2. Citi premier miles,btohqsg
Any creative solutions to withdrawing balance in youtrip ?,btohqsg
I tot 90N miles no expiry too?,btohqsg
Oh great üëç and no fees,btohqsg
Hello just to check   for uob credit card supp card   the monthly statement and the mobile app will show how much the supp card spend ? ( I.e. each transaction will label is it supp card or main card spending ? )At moment no UOB account yet :),btohqsg
Amaze + Citi rewards  can use for SP bills? Will have 4mpd? May I ask?,btohqsg
does this work? thought it is treated as non-transferable balance,btohqsg
I think the person meant top up shopee with youtrip card. Once the money is in shopee  you can transfer to bank account.,btohqsg
if the money is treated as non-transferable balance by shopee  it cant be withdrawn to bank account right? or am i missing something here?,btohqsg
Youtrip is debit card so it shouldnt go to shopee non transferrable balance. Thats in theory but i havent done it myself.,btohqsg
"my past experiences topping up from these ""prepaid"" cards (they are not officially debit cards) are their balances are usually treated as non-transferable  would need a dp to confirm though",btohqsg
Hello.. can I ask for eSIM  Eskimo better or Airalo?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if UOB ladys category under fashion  does Rolex shop  hour glass entitle for the 10 miles per $1?,btohqsg
A few things. Watch shop mcc (5944) is not under UOB lady fashion. Second  10mpd only when you have 100k in UOB saving  which isn't recommended. And third  Rolex most likely burst 1k/2k cap of UOB lady.,btohqsg
Ah yes  I totally forgot about cap! Thank you!,btohqsg
yes  there will be an additional section for supp card,btohqsg
Can i check using uob ppv and uob vs for shell and spc.Uob ppv get 0 mpdUob vs get 3.6mpd?,btohqsg
Uob vs u need to spend 1k in the statement month to get bonus,btohqsg
If renting big amount for car rental  which CC is good? ~$4k on hertz,btohqsg
the best card i can think of is SCB manhattan. but it has been discontinued.but no harm asking your travel mates going with u  if any of them happen to have this card,btohqsg
