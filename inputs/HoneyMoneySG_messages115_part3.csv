ya coz after buyGot the air ticket come out,btohqsg
"That's not how you check if it's genuine... Like is the air ticket is genuine too? Especially if the ticket ""come out"" on the same exact website.Make sure you verify your booking on their app or something. Stay safe üëçüèª",btohqsg
Report for fraud if u cant map the transaction to an invoice/receipt :),btohqsg

Hmmm okay  did consider this as well but just want to be sure  besides the ‚ÄúExcluded Transactions‚Äù in the card tnc refers to cashback or miles eligibility (versus for the purposes of NTB reward). Because for some cards like Maybank Visa Plat - insurance payments is not an ‚ÄúExcluded Transaction‚Äù for cashback but very typically  most NTB rewards exclude insurance payments as spending for the purposes of NTB rewards.Samsam and Melvyn shifu  apologies for my ineptitude - please may you perhaps lmk on what is ‚ÄúExcluded Transactions‚Äù for the purpose of NTB rewards if it is defined in that TnC  if you have read?Many Thanks,btohqsg
Hi guys  would like to ask  if u use ocbc 360 to credit salary  do u find that the $ comes in later than usual..? Thank u,btohqsg
You meant salary coming in later?,btohqsg
Could be just suay that your card got unauthorised transaction. Even official website sometimes may be unsafe depending on the company‚Äôs security,btohqsg
Usually my salary comes in 14th  my pay day is 15th.,btohqsg
So i need to ask hr..?,btohqsg
Your company‚Äôs bank account might be with another bank other than ocbc  hence the time lag also,btohqsg
Any kind soul can enlighten me whether using Dbs altitude to pay for travel agency LGE travel entitles to 2.2 miles pls. Thx,btohqsg
That‚Äôs normal no? My payday on 28th I sometime receive it like 30 or 31,btohqsg
When i use posb no lag,btohqsg
What‚Äôs your definition of ‚Äúno lag‚Äù,btohqsg
Maybe your company pay from POSB/DBS.,btohqsg
Thank u all for the kind replies. I receive pay on the day itself but typically earlier,btohqsg
My dbs altitude got auto annual fee reversal. Does this mean I don‚Äôt get 10k miles for annual fee payments? Is it worth it actually to pay 1.8cents per mile?,btohqsg
AF will also have gst so its 196. And no  not worth paying 1.9cpm.,btohqsg
Anyone knows which cards works with Spotify in Singapore,btohqsg

You better use a different card to earn miles,btohqsg
Do you mean you have received the $100 ecapitavoucher for the May Snack challenge?,btohqsg
Hi  I have UOB lady's card category family. Just to check  anyone knows if I will earn bonus miles even from Kopitiam transactions from fairprice app in app?,btohqsg
No. That is under uob lady dining.,btohqsg
If you could suggest any good card to earn miles on public transport,btohqsg
Will you use this card for anything else? Spending on public transport alone will take a long time to get enough for miles redemption.,btohqsg
I was planning to spend on my subscriptions and fast food joints and get a supplementary card and ask my spouse to also use for public transports,btohqsg
I have a citi rewards as another credit card for miles as well linked with Amaze,btohqsg
Hi  I have a question.Will I earn 4mpd if I am using UOB lady (transport) for SPC petrol station?,btohqsg
SC Smart card is better used for cashback. Takes too long and inefficient to even hit the minimum point block to redeem miles (I think is 30k+ points),btohqsg
For buying flight tickets on SQ which cC card earns the best miles,btohqsg
Hi  for Nex voucher promo  if buy 2 sets will get 2 x $5 bonus voucher? Cos the tnc put only can buy 1 set tho. But it seems like i can buy more than 1 set,btohqsg
Depends on amount and cards you have access to. UOB lady solitare can cover 2k or dbs wwmc can cover 1.5k amount. More than that  use uob kris flyer.,btohqsg
Thank youHow about UOB priv miles? Is this good?,btohqsg
Not as good as the other 3 options I suggested unless you are new to uob and want to hit signup bonus spend requirements.,btohqsg
