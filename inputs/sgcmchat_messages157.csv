i last time alw see the youtube carter carter HAHAHABA,btohqsg

not as rare as you'd think lol,btohqsg
bro aventador lp700 means only 700 in the world bro,btohqsg

Ngl the top widget looks like an android the bottom looks like the apple thing,btohqsg
but wmmt ffb is absolute shit,btohqsg
355 challenge  initial d has better ffb,btohqsg
and 355 challenge was from the 90s.,btohqsg
battle gear had amazing ffb too.,btohqsg
not sure why you're being so fucked in the ass about it lol,btohqsg
the FFB system has been the same since WMMT3  about time they changed it.,btohqsg
i play it from time to time to chill  but it's fucked that the ffb hasn't changed since the 2000s.,btohqsg
don't take jabs at others without looking at the bigger picture.,btohqsg
yeah. only when you go over the bridge expanders. that's it.,btohqsg
that's your perception  i have mine,btohqsg
why are you so fucked in the ass about it lol,btohqsg
ffb needs work for wmmt to keep up,btohqsg
look if you have an issue  message me privately,btohqsg
my opinion is that wmmt needs work. ffb wise,btohqsg
if you want to be dense in the head then you do you,btohqsg
and am i supposed to give a shit about how it comes across..?,btohqsg
in general  the game needs work,btohqsg
if you can't understand the point that i'm trying to raise  then i suggest you should take a step back,btohqsg
i've tried WMMT on a belt driven  directdrive and gear driven wheel.,btohqsg
Honestly i feel like it‚Äôs still important to be civil,btohqsg
the ffb on those are significantly better than what they offer,btohqsg
there is a lot of people here and it‚Äôs good to be a little polite sometimes,btohqsg
hence why i'm saying that it's behind the times,btohqsg
but being aggro about wmmt being suited for kids and all,btohqsg
but if he wants to be a white knight and be the shining star that loves wmmt without understanding my point,btohqsg
then it doesn't make sense to me,btohqsg
tbvh marc he was a lot more civil about this than you were,btohqsg
if you scroll up and look at the tone and language used,btohqsg
let‚Äôs just try to be more level headed with all discussions guys,btohqsg
shittiest ffb ever btw holy shit,btohqsg
the ffb was so dog i just gave up,btohqsg
did you at least try the dumb level system,btohqsg
i think it was a good idea bad execution,btohqsg
should be like class or car type at least,btohqsg
i tried the game for the whole of half an hour,btohqsg
you have to upgrade per car...,btohqsg
seems like they did nothing to fix the game,btohqsg
i had all the assists turned off  max everything,btohqsg
in fact  in comparison to FM7 this feels awful.,btohqsg
honestly atp i don‚Äôt rmb how fm7 feels,btohqsg
the thing is they changed the shift mechanics with this,btohqsg
i just rmb fh3 being fire,btohqsg
"so you can't really ""heel toe"" without the game eating shit",btohqsg
i literally didn‚Äôt play enough to tell,btohqsg
feels the same  just slightly better.,btohqsg
and my moza stuff couldn‚Äôt bind properly,btohqsg
ya i heard moza is fucked on FM,btohqsg
forza ffb has never been good  they've somehow made it worse,btohqsg
i loved the series for so long,btohqsg
"funny how they milked the ""from the ground up"" thing and it was the same old shit since FM5",btohqsg
they peaked with FH3 and FM6 imo,btohqsg
WRC is crap because of the physics engine  but the upcoming one is based off UE5(?) and Dirt 2.0 physics,btohqsg
though the historic car roster is abit lacklustre,btohqsg
cos WRC is under Codies now,btohqsg
why cant anyone count to three,btohqsg
*zero*2017-2021cars aside from a Fiesta and Polo,btohqsg
you wouldn't want your parents to count to 3 with a cane in the hand would you,btohqsg
in comparison to the subies  yes,btohqsg
so the only GD Impreza is the Bugeye,btohqsg
tbh the bugeye is probably the most iconic one,btohqsg
i'd say the GD gen was iconic back then,btohqsg
tbf all the subies are iconic,btohqsg
except the 2011 sedan. we dont talk about that,btohqsg
i think there are 2 hatches actually,btohqsg
the NR4 spec and the WRC spec.,btohqsg
eh the senna outside rm is tht till when?,btohqsg
iirc it was just there for the opening,btohqsg
if they reuse the DR2 impreza,btohqsg
especially the GC8. they scanned the wrong car.,btohqsg
iirc they scanned the wrong year. someone pointed it out in a thread awhile back,btohqsg
i think they scanned the later 96 Impreza instead of the 95,btohqsg
and wrong plates on the 95 one too,btohqsg
think the DR2 one was L***ZAC or something,btohqsg
but that aside  the Rally 1 cars are promising. a friend of mine got to try out the dev build with a R16,btohqsg
he races R4 or R5 cars iirc  it's a great step up from DR2 in terms of physics.,btohqsg
the game yes  the rallying no,btohqsg
or maybe they just overlooked it,btohqsg
fella hit a tree and fractured his hand,btohqsg
they could just scan the whole car,btohqsg
i almost with my r9 tho,btohqsg
think he hit a rut and it yeeted him into a tree,btohqsg
brain turned off and i left my thumb in my formula wheel,btohqsg
but the lack of customisation is holding me back,btohqsg
also mainly because i love the fanatec shifter as opposed to the moza,btohqsg
the clutch pedal and gas is same so,btohqsg
oh so its the same one we have,btohqsg
did yours come with the brake mod?,btohqsg
had a spare spring and parts,btohqsg
not sure if it is the mod you mean,btohqsg
i mean just spring feel only and ergo,btohqsg
idk how good it can be la,btohqsg
u yank it it just engages imo good enough liao,btohqsg
i think one ecosystem better ba,btohqsg
my pedals and wheelbase don‚Äôt fit in the hub so,btohqsg
should be all in one right,btohqsg
they show up in moza pithouse shd be ok ba,btohqsg
irl too but this puts it in perspective,btohqsg
I on my break n i saw this,btohqsg
i break my balls and i see this,btohqsg
lets just say turn 10 sucks,btohqsg
i doubt i would get Forza Motorsport,btohqsg
save the money for better games,btohqsg
GTR Revival  Le Mans Ultimate  EA WRC 2023,btohqsg
i havent buy gt7 lol but ill get eoy,btohqsg
i got 2060 but maybe change 3080,btohqsg
say eoy or early next year,btohqsg
iw upgrade to 3080 also but coe price like this no chance,btohqsg
both will eat out of my savings,btohqsg
