Very scary sia. They happy happy jiu block people with no way to appeal. Like that if innocent people kena dun nid survive Liao,btohqsg
Then you got the money for the items you sold but account was frozen n closed. The buyer who xfer the money loss it. The scammer walked away with your items for free. Right?,btohqsg
Yes  I went down the police station to give statement for this case. End up the IO never update me le,btohqsg
how to appeal this case to MAS? is it considered a dispute with uob or report as regulatory breach or misconduct by a financial institution,btohqsg
When banks give a customer a facility (eg. Bank account or credit card) to perform financial transactions  they are also under a risk. If anything wrong  the bank may be fined by MAS. Hence  bank also wants to protect themselves.You can read up on recent ocbc phishing cases that bank loss 10 of millions dollars recently.Please take care bank account info and also don‚Äôt play with the bank facility that gives you convenience.,btohqsg
I have no info on this other than suggest you go to other bank.Just remember not to reveal your bank accounts info to strangers in the future.,btohqsg
yeah now dun dare to sell things online liao. cash is still king. it's a shame other bank dw interest match uob one account to compete,btohqsg
You have the initial copy of report from the police? Maybe try to send the scanned report to UOB to appeal,btohqsg
I understand that uob one exclusion list not able to earn cashback but does the mcc in the exclusion list at least count towards minimum spend of 500$?,btohqsg
I think all banks should follow DBS credit cards that follow the transaction date. This will make everyone's life easier,btohqsg
dun have wor  the IO never update at all. I will try writing in to UOB again. first time experience discrimination. not a good feeling üò®,btohqsg
Try ask him for a copy of the old report  even if there's no update.,btohqsg
It is already defined in the TnC what type of transactions are excluded from cashback but count towards the uob one account bonus interest.,btohqsg
Unless you have $100k in your saving  otherwise UOB One is not the highest at the moment.,btohqsg
Kena scam by UOB CSO. Called in to change my CC statement date. She said change will take effect on the following month and current month will still be the original statement date. Asked to reconfirm and she confirmed it. Apparently statement date was already changed  so now have spending that exceeded the cashback limit. üò°,btohqsg
Oo Which is the highest for lower right now. I like uob 1 cuz their requirements are easy to hit.The DBS and OCBC got so many box to tick,btohqsg
But maybe really no choice Liao. Need change bank if worse case üòï,btohqsg
Depends on how much saving you are looking at. If you only have $10k  choco 4.5%  moomoo 5.8% whereas uob one only give you 3.xx%,btohqsg
Maribank deposit 1k get 100 shoppee voucher,btohqsg
thanks will read up more. but all these no SDIC so dk safe to park emergency savings anot,btohqsg
The exclusion list for uob one savings account is more relax. I rmb insurance counts towards the 500$,btohqsg
yes insurance is the only thing that is relaxed,btohqsg
Is it safe to say that eligible spend for UOB One account interests also counted as eligible spend for UOB One card rebates? (Except insurance),btohqsg
Anyone facing issue making Salary payment into UOB One $1600  I can no longer find that option in OCBC or DBS?,btohqsg
It is stated in TnC. Pls read the TnC if you want to earn the rewards/cashback.,btohqsg
Strictly speaking no. Eg. You spend $100 on dining using UOB Lady card  the $100 counts towards uob one account bonus interest  but not count towards UOB One credit card cash rebate.,btohqsg
May i know which app can use the card to pay for hawkers centre?.bcz i saw a lot of shops just accept with paynow  can't use gpay to make a payment,btohqsg
I use PayLah! If they only accept paynow  no Cashback,btohqsg
Hello  if one is buying iPhone 15  and has a UOB Lady's card with Fashion category selected  I should purchase this off Shopee/Lazada instead of Apple Online store right? Thank you!,btohqsg
Bcz i am looking for using card to pay the hawkers with paynow?,btohqsg
Xnap can use the card to pay for paynow shop?,btohqsg
Bcz i can't see the logo under the qr code.,btohqsg
shopee MCC is marketplaces not fashion/clothing store specifically so you cant use that cardhttps://heymax.ai/merchant/shopeeuob lady supported mcc:https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/ladys-cards-tcs.pdf,btohqsg
You may want to take a photo of all the logo under the QR code n show us. Not all hawkers accept payment using credit card.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think you can do it  as far as I know ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Xnap app via gpay. Look out for the Xnap/liquid pay logo below the QR code.... ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Thanks a lot for your reply :) guess I'll have to look for another avenue now haha,btohqsg
XNAP with Apple Pay can do it?,btohqsg
If u dun see the logo  likely it's not accepted by Xnap  though u can still try ur luck n scan the qr code with the Xnap app...üòÑ,btohqsg
Am not an AAPL user  so not familiar.... üòä,btohqsg
Nobody knows what you see. Hard to comment.Some hawkers only accept paynow from banks account.,btohqsg
Sometimes  the qr code accepts grabpay paynow,btohqsg
Then which once more familiar? Bcz i just have favepay and gpay,btohqsg
XNAP counted as online payment even when paying for Paynow QR ?,btohqsg
You cant use xnap on a paynow qr  only a SG qr (they are different),btohqsg
Hi experts  does anybody know if UOB lady solitiaire can be waived on the second year onwards?,btohqsg
That said yes  xnap counted as online payment. You can use it if the QR indicates a xnap or liquidpay logo below the QR code,btohqsg
Just see the logos below the qr code  if they are same as the app as you're using...dun waste time and confuse yourself about sg qr code  pay now qr code  etc ...,btohqsg
Sometimes grab pay can scan paynow QR code  but only 0.3% cashback with uob Amex   not worth trying‚Ä¶,btohqsg
yeah what i meant is   for payment using xnap is counted as online payment right even though you are paying to a QR code,btohqsg
