Your Morning Quick Read ‚Äì 24 July 2021It has become one of the most anticipated corporate earnings next week as significant technology companies release their 2nd quarter earnings results. And in the pipeline is Tesla  which will report on Monday  after the market closes.Let‚Äôs run through what we can expect.The result will be complicated on multiple fontsThe earnings report is likely to be a complex puzzle as the bears and bulls fight for the direction of the stocks. The estimation is for Tesla to report about 94 cents per share in earnings with sales of $11.5 billion. We would usually need to see Tesla hitting above this target for meaningful upside swing.The variables are wideThe automobile industry has been facing many uncertainty and headwinds. This would also surface in Tesla‚Äôs earning. First  we have a semiconductor shortage that is impairing the supply of Tesla cards. Next  vehicle pricing and vehicle profit margins are hit  given a relatively young recovery phase of the economy. And finally  investors will review Tesla‚Äôs battery storage business.To sum up  Tesla will need an apparent breakthrough in its operating profit to allow the stocks to escape from their current range.**How has Tesla stocks performed thus far?**In 2020 third quarter  we saw Tesla reporting an operating profit of $800 million  and this saw the stock price jumped by more than doubled to around $860 within 3 months. However  when the operating profit growth moderates towards the subsequent quarters  investors start to offload its shares  and it has come down to the $640 region. Therefore  profit stagnation appears to have a significant influence on Tesla‚Äôs equity price.Nonetheless. things are rosy in investors‚Äô minds. They expect a record-breaking operating profit of around $835 million for the 2nd quarter  underpinned by solid deliveries. If we look back at the recent deliveries  the 2nd quarter of 2021 is the first time Tesla had delivered more than 200 000 vehicles in one quarter. That‚Äôs a feat of achievement.The bulls and bears argumentsWhen the results are released  the common theme is the fight over the representation and interpretation of the results. Two key factors are critical in the discussion. The first is how Tesla generates its sales by selling the regulatory credits. In the first quarter  Tesla generated about $518 million in credit sales  which had boosted Tesla‚Äôs earnings. Eventually  this credits sale will die down as more legacy car brands start to sell their own EVs.Then we have the Bitcoins concern. Tesla did recognize some gains on their Bitcoin holdings during the first quarter results. However  the cryptocurrency has since then plunged by half from its April peak. This means that we could expect a slight loss to hit the bottom line.And finally  the weak news from Tesla‚Äôs new German plant will be a concern coupled with its Austin  Texas facility. The Austin plant is meant for Cybertruck production. And with this production concerns comes its lucrative driver-assistance functions where it has begun selling that software in a subscription model. Then  Tesla might have to provide more information on how it can make money from its charging network  as Elon Musk tweeted on opening the infrastructure to competing EV car brands.The earnings conference will be the highlight  and the fate lies in the details and metrics. But  for investors  it will be the beginning with an end destination in mind for Tesla‚Äôs future.It is on 24 July  Saturday  10.25 am in Singapore. Pika World wishes all a sunny and safe weekend.,btohqsg
