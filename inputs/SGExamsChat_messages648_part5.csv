ik quite a few people taking it,btohqsg
yeah I would definitely take SMU over kaplan,btohqsg
i had the same reaction tho,btohqsg
i can see some specific application though in terms of consulting?,btohqsg
just based on reputation itself would push me to SMU alr,btohqsg
hmm its not really just about the duration  but the support and networking also,btohqsg
from what I heard from my friends in SMU they do have pretty good support for techies,btohqsg
like they will also push you to do AWS certs and stuff,btohqsg
there's definitely more opportunity than just grinding out a cert fast game,btohqsg
IM SUPPOSED TO SLACK TILL END OF CONDUCT,btohqsg
if you cmi then even if 18 months you’ll still face a ton of issues bc a lot of stuff will be cramped in,btohqsg
i have no clue what that is,btohqsg
uni isn’t just about getting the piece of paper itself if you wanna make full use of it,btohqsg
there's quite a lot of variable to it though  are you aiming to get a job in europe for your first job fresh out of graduation? what if you don't get it and have to settle locally?,btohqsg
i mean it’s either bennu or drakon,btohqsg
hmm by then it is less towards your cert but more your experience yeah  it's kind of up to you  i would personally value the opportunities provided by SMU as well as the name (honestly kaplan not really seen well locally haha) over kaplan,btohqsg
if you're really rushing to get out to work its fine i guess  but whether employers will take it well on 18 months degree is another thing,btohqsg
yeah are you sure you aren't mixing it up with diploma,btohqsg
my take is private unis not only have less support in terms of opportunities and networking but,btohqsg
actually i worry more about the rigor of the course  does it actually prepare you well for tech haha,btohqsg
also less support in terms of giving you a proper education lol,btohqsg
yeah this is my main gripe too,btohqsg
i have had SIT interns who doesn't even know how to traverse a binary tree in year 3,btohqsg
so kaplan.... i abit scared to hear,btohqsg
"yeah very  i was talking to them then they were like ""huh what tree""",btohqsg
but interview they cfm won't pass,btohqsg
i just think you need to think more long term and not just getting the paper,btohqsg
like you gotta know what’s your long term plan beyond just “work many years then go europe”,btohqsg
@Polarbearnextdooram i in drakon or bennu,btohqsg
yep! they're actually equally competent as the NUS y1/y2 interns but they will fall apart hard in tech interview where theories and basics are tested,btohqsg
what work is that can i ask,btohqsg
but sample size small since its only that few that i've worked with,btohqsg
but unfortunately the gateway to an internship/job is based on your cs fundamentals so,btohqsg
i mean you seem pretty set as is on getting one ASAP,btohqsg
then what’s the point of asking,btohqsg
like i’m not trying to be mean,btohqsg
yeah  what we can tell you is that from a learning perspective (basic  fundamentals and theory) plus networking/opportunity  you're going to lose out,btohqsg
so you just need to make your own choice haha,btohqsg
like if you’re planning to use the degree itself to get a job  SMU will take you further albeit taking longer,btohqsg
kaplan is more of a you have a piece of paper but you better have the skills outside of the paper,btohqsg
the paper alone won’t do much imo,btohqsg
yeah  once you get into technical interview you will fall apart if you aren't taught well  there's a reason why NUS CS is so highly looked upon because of their rigour,btohqsg
you can’t dismiss networking opportunities is all i’m saying la,btohqsg
if you’re 100% fine with falling back with what you currently do then your call,btohqsg
ppl ik taking CS private degree seriously are mostly trying to do masters,btohqsg
I mean it's just a degree-for-money service,btohqsg
im in bennu but bennu is red house,btohqsg
simulating when got rogue ppl/intruder into camp,btohqsg
and im getting cancer from this,btohqsg
does anyone know why singapore employ gurkhas,btohqsg
