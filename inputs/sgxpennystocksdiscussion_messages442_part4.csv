At least  Fortress closed -1.4% lower.,btohqsg
Some form of collection is going on,btohqsg
Have the pie chart for Fortress？,btohqsg
End July maybe..together with the shipping report..,btohqsg
I thinking ofjeepFortress. Problem is when？ 🤔,btohqsg
From a Textbook TA perspective.. when the price hit MA10,btohqsg
We can see that it did bounce off Ma10 previously.. Might follow again,btohqsg
Anyway don't rush to put in money,btohqsg
Money in pocket is loss of 5% per annum due to inflation.. money in stocks...well,btohqsg
Haha...FOMO is pain.. I end up hating myself for the rest of the week if I give in to Fomo,btohqsg
When price hit 0.605  then rush in？,btohqsg
MA10 will be moving upwards in the next few days.. so likely to be able 0.625 by then ?,btohqsg
Turn on moving average on your charts and see,btohqsg
If you are risk adverse.. buy at Ma20.. if you are up for it.. Get at ma10,btohqsg
Metals tmr up another 100% or shortist day?,btohqsg

Good morning Hustlepeople !QOTD“If you are not willing to risk the unusual  you will have to settle for the ordinary.”– Jim Rohn“He who risks and fails can be forgiven. He who never risks and never fails is a failure in his whole being.”– Paul TillichPositivity onwards !As mentioned earlier  I believe the time to risk have come and it has come. Yesterday  I’ve heard something quite unheard of in the SGX market. There was someone who I know that won approx $200k. It only means one thing.Let’s go and blessed day ahead!PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.,btohqsg
