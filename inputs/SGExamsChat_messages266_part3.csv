Basically nth unless got smth to talk abt,btohqsg
you can start a convo :),btohqsg
Hey all. My mom has been issued a quarantine order from MOH. Am I allowed to step out of the house and buy food for her? (I am a household member),btohqsg
Just order food and opt for contactless delivery,btohqsg
ask them to hang at the door and wait for them to go out first,btohqsg
if u need any grocery or anything just order using app and opt for contactless delivery first.,btohqsg
if ur mum kena QO and serving at home  you should have been issued QO as well,btohqsg
either that or your mum shld hv been sent to GQF,btohqsg
She just received a message from Moh saying to stay at home first and wait for a call from Certis,btohqsg
And also to inform close contacts to stay at home,btohqsg
Itâ€™s been 7 hours since the message,btohqsg
Close contacts doesnâ€™t always mean households members?,btohqsg
well  that's alws up for interpretation under context  which i have none of,btohqsg
so what i can say is,btohqsg
yeah u need anything just opt for contactless delivery to be safe uh meanwhile take care man.,btohqsg
my bro and dad also kena QO recently,btohqsg
Fam members are NOT restricted by Law  but advised to cut contact from others. Those on QO at home are required to stay in their room of Quarantine till they're moved to QOF,btohqsg
i wonder what are they building on that land between JE MRT and Jcube,btohqsg
Should be the jurong region line part of the mrt,btohqsg
wow they started building that metro line alr ??,btohqsg
Yes. Some of the stations already started construction last year,btohqsg
Then the plot of land you were talking about  they are building the jurong east integrated transport hub with it,btohqsg
Do you think taxis are public transport,btohqsg
U privately hire taxis and this service is not necessarily open to the public once u ride it  unless u share rides,btohqsg
LTA classifies taxis as public transport  although some other sources may say it's not,btohqsg
It ain't no public good though,btohqsg
"But even if public transport got the word ""public"" does not mean it's a public good in the first place",btohqsg
Need to refer to the 2 conditions,btohqsg
How on earth is it a merit good??,btohqsg
y set so low standards 4 yrself,btohqsg
idk if thatâ€™s a word but yes,btohqsg
havenâ€™t been doing much work for the past two days,btohqsg
like i sit down with complete focus and then i break down,btohqsg
there's your problemtry to pace yourself better if possible,btohqsg
istg if u feel burnt out just rest its ok,btohqsg
go for long walks while listening to music!,btohqsg
Spend more time with family (I would say friends but its harder to do nowadays),btohqsg
I just give up and take a break,btohqsg
"Anyone knows if the shop ""cash converters"" still open for biz?",btohqsg
Also is it normal to learn 4 instruments-?,btohqsg
i mean if u can handle and u v good at them then ofc,btohqsg
Cuz I wanna learn 1 more .-.,btohqsg
the talent and patience i don't have ðŸ˜©,btohqsg
My friend bought a gz ahh,btohqsg
Then I went over last time,btohqsg
i cant rlly spend time with them-,btohqsg
I admire thatpersonally I've played guitar and nothing more  for 4.5yrs at this pointtbh the biggest factor stopping me from learning more instruments is the cost lmaooprobably because I'm uncertain if it would be worth it spending hundreds on completely new stuffbut with guitar related gear I know I can make use of them,btohqsg
I wanna learn electric guitar -,btohqsg
not as ex as a drum kit ahh,btohqsg
everytine people ask me how much my e guitar costI always lie and say its cost 25% of the price I actually paid,btohqsg
