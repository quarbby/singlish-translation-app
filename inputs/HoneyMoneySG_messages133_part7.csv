Oh noooo . Wasted the opportunity,btohqsg
i want to buy a projector from china website and they charge in RMB.if i use UOB Visa signature online ( since it’s FCY )     will i get 4mpd ?or must be “contactless overseas”?,btohqsg
Hi guys  I have the UOB One  KrisFlyer  and UOB Lady's Cards. Both the KrisFlyer and Lady's Cards are linked with Amaze. Amaze only gives points up to a certain limit. What happens if I exceed that limit? After that  which card is more reliable? Thank you!,btohqsg
Uob one card more reliable in this case? I am using this before oct 1.,btohqsg
What do you mean by more reliable?,btohqsg
Also  if swipe for dinner at 11pm  is it likely that transaction is posted that night or next day? I want to use lady card tomorrow,btohqsg
Now that the amaze points limit is over  which card gives more advantage?,btohqsg
dun really need to care too much about amaze points. Just that it as bonus if have  not a key factor of which card to use.,btohqsg
hi  can anyone confirm - hsbc revo card will get the 4mpd for online purchases on apple online shop i.e. buying apple watchhave checked mcc and looks like yes  just want to be sure,btohqsg
U can use digibot on browser and check.For posting  it depends when merchant settle their transactions. So it can be a day or two,btohqsg
U must hit 1k sgd equal in fcy to get 4 mpd,btohqsg
Your this kind of message. Quite easy to be misunderstood.,btohqsg
Never use insurance policies as an investment.Keep investments and insurance separate.Buy term insurance  invest the rest.,btohqsg
Yeah I wasn’t sure if want to report or not. Later genuine sharer angry me.,btohqsg
There's a real coinrabbit but he sent scam one,btohqsg
Any cash Stratgey for this month ? No updates from HSBC / SC Esaver,btohqsg
Hi Guys  just wanted to check regarding SPYL on IBKR. Just tried setting up a recurring investment and noticed there are 4 option  are the first and 3rd one the same?,btohqsg
You may consider changing FA. Very dishonest ethics.,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/mY7vDeuvHrg?si=lP0KwqTiJtOzwgxhThis is the latest one. Will update with new offers (if any) in 4Q October,btohqsg
Check the demonited currency. im with EBS one for USD,btohqsg
Correction. Returns will be from negative to up to positive 7%. Capital is not protected. You can lose up to 30% in bad economic times. AIA won’t compensate for your losses. So you want to invest based on this?,btohqsg
Both 1st and 3rd are in USD so I'm assuming they are the same?,btohqsg
Maybe different exchanges  previously only the EBS was available,btohqsg
Just hit at least SGD 1000 in foreign currency. No need to be contactless,btohqsg
Uob VS mobile contactless with not earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Foreign currency can be tap/insert/online. Local currency transaction must be contactless.,btohqsg
Ok I realized buying wreath cannot use DBS woman world card.,btohqsg
You should ask ur agent instead. Capital only guaranteed on death is 💀💀💀.,btohqsg
That's where they get the fees from 🤪,btohqsg
Anyone having issues with applepay?After successful transaction they don’t appear in Apple wallet,btohqsg
Seems ok for me. Used it 2h ago w uob lady.,btohqsg
I'm also having issues since 2h ago. Paying with my card still works,btohqsg
Used Uob ppv for both restaurant  it does not give 4mpd on heymax tracking  have not checked the rewards uni$ yet. Anyone encounter this? Overseas spending,btohqsg
If mobile contactless doesn’t matter. OP might have used the card to paywave,btohqsg
Right I’m using it contactless  yes pending.,btohqsg
Maybe just wait till the transaction post and see if you get the UNI$ in your banking app. I’ll still trust the uob app > Heymax tracking,btohqsg
What method does heymax app show? I assumed jp terminals sent something different from what heymax expected as contactless. And what mcc did u get for those 2 trnx? (Though unlikely an issue as ppv is blacklist card).,btohqsg
I mean the payment goes through. But the details don’t show up in Appel wallet,btohqsg
Huh  for me it doesn’t go through at all,btohqsg
does it show on ur cc transaction history?,btohqsg
It’s Maybank. Lousy not instant one,btohqsg
seems to be Master thingyapplepay master transactions don't reflect in Apple Walletapplepay visa transactions are reflecting properly in apple wallet,btohqsg
Both shown as contactless 5812 5814.,btohqsg
anyone know which is the best tertiary credit card and if there’s multiple what’s their difference usage in terms of lifestyle,btohqsg
What is a tertiary credit card?,btohqsg
Do u even have income to apply credit card?,btohqsg
Other than chocolate finance and mariinvest  which other products offer high liquidity ie. instant cash withdrawal?,btohqsg
Just search student credit card and compareThere’s offerings from DBS Maybank CIMB Citibank. Could have missed out from other banks.,btohqsg
Tertiary credit card does not need income. Usually credit limit is $500 with some banks offer lesser rewards.,btohqsg
Yes  some even as low as 0.3% equivalent. Lol,btohqsg
