And holy fk what is this question LMAO,btohqsg
ans is practical but wont fly in exam,btohqsg
Why would a car need to speed up so fast for you to experience length contraction,btohqsg
i tot u say special relativity is ez smh,btohqsg
Bruh I'd assume that the length contraction at 1.5/3.5 is at least 10% of c,btohqsg
Hello for intermediate steps involving currency what dp do u leave it to,btohqsg
And of course nothing can reach this speed,btohqsg
Then can go into another dimension,btohqsg
So thus fitting into the garage,btohqsg
Tell the car owner cut his car in half. Sure can fit,btohqsg
Cher say ans to 2 dp,btohqsg
unfortunately this will net 0 points in exam,btohqsg
Wolfram says a is v‚âà0.903508 cEDIT: b. is 1.5  but that's an 'exact fit' and also the car must maintain velocity (or rather  the garage needs to maintain this velocity relative to the car  same-ish),btohqsg
Then I guess for intermediate put 4 dp,btohqsg
B because the builder is dumb,btohqsg
qn mentions to use observer to explain,btohqsg
Garage will travel at speed of sound,btohqsg
Then car travel at speed of light,btohqsg
How many children can be saved,btohqsg
Length of garage thus seen by driver is 3.5*10^8 m,btohqsg
ok this is even darker than my source material,btohqsg
i am reporting you to the police for drug usage,btohqsg
What sort of theoretical physics is dis,btohqsg
Another way is to have a two door garage,btohqsg
Open both doors and car can fit without closing the doors,btohqsg
Then no need travel at speed of light. Travel at speed of snail can liao,btohqsg
That‚Äôs like saying stop the train to a trolley problem,btohqsg
Stop the trolley boarding the train,btohqsg
Train can go in garage but car cannot,btohqsg
If they tell u interest rate is 5% per annum but compounded half yearly,btohqsg
a small price to pay for salvation,btohqsg
Must u divide by the time period oso,btohqsg
Like is r still 5 or 2.5,btohqsg
Derp I think I was wrong in the 'not fitting' part,btohqsg
The owner is a direct observer as well,btohqsg
so the frame of reference is the car.  which would be traveling at 0.9c and the garage would be 1.5m which would be deltaL0,btohqsg
Ya the garage should be exactly 1.5m (as measured by the moving car),btohqsg
But considering that the car still has momentum,btohqsg
Divide r by 2 and multiply n by 2,btohqsg
Honestly there's a lot of weird part about it,btohqsg
And part b is just a 'beginning',btohqsg
the components in question are simply entities to help visualisation,btohqsg
There is fine line between love and hate,btohqsg
Hey hey no hate speech in this chat,btohqsg
Ok  i (antonym of love) kor,btohqsg
If you're saying this  it implies that you used to love him,btohqsg
I make alt with his original number,btohqsg
I have yet to exercise my admin powers,btohqsg
He meant my kor will ban me himself...,btohqsg
"U forgot the """" around powers",btohqsg
Lol there's this random beetle flying around my room,btohqsg
Oh god old flame is not the best metaphor in this instance,btohqsg
Looks like u know what ur late night snack is gonna be,btohqsg
I find it easier than micro tho ngl,btohqsg
It isn't if you're not related by blood,btohqsg
Well  incest rhymes with best for a reason,btohqsg
why this hc guy talking about incest online....,btohqsg
It's now a degen shitfest and u know why,btohqsg
There is an age old shibboleth that goes,btohqsg
Can i use a needle to poke my blister,btohqsg
i am angered that u say hc guy,btohqsg
vulgarity is no substitute for wit,btohqsg
U should have seen the messages that he sent in discord,btohqsg
we are all singaporeans  all the same,btohqsg
Run it under a flame first,btohqsg
Why segregate the hwach and non hwqqch people?,btohqsg
i just binged all 6 seasons of downton abbey so i will be quoting from it for the rest of the month,btohqsg
Can't believe we live in such society,btohqsg
Infection from an unclean needle is even worse,btohqsg
Ok let's segregate into ri ppl hci ppl and the rest,btohqsg
ya lor why not just nuke that school near downtown line 8,btohqsg
need big bomb to take out entire campus,btohqsg
Wait till u see actual elitism,btohqsg
Do you think a puny bomb will wipe out hwach?,btohqsg
We do not talk about Hci international smh,btohqsg
Why need wait? Elitism very active,btohqsg
Depends on how puny the bomb is,btohqsg
no but attacking their pride will,btohqsg
Hci and hcjc is fake hwach,btohqsg
hwa chong is actually a neighbourhood jc,btohqsg
Don't you know? Kingsmakers are never ever public figures.,btohqsg
Because hwach is a China school,btohqsg
Why is tiktok jc owning sg,btohqsg
Hwa Chong whatever hood contains no(?) HDBs,btohqsg
i dont see ‚Äúalumnus of hwa chong‚Äù on this list,btohqsg
we have tan kah kee station,btohqsg
I told you alr kingmakers not public,btohqsg
Surprisingly many seniors like to go overseas for uni,btohqsg
When is it ever not weird,btohqsg
Eh gotta say I don't recognise most of the entries on the list LOL,btohqsg
Job well done then according to you,btohqsg
'surprisingly'? Are you faking this or just writing this for fun,btohqsg
i was genuinely surprised when i found out,btohqsg
new name for deposers and usurpers,btohqsg
True inequality is when you have to libgen that book to write an essay,btohqsg
Despite him holding the highest executive position I have less interest in him than some other 'Civil Servants',btohqsg

Hais another one who discriminate against lgbt,btohqsg
This is why SGEducators > SGExams/s,btohqsg
I'm not sure if Alonzo Church has a story as exciting,btohqsg
But tbf im damn gay so,btohqsg
That works on the same logic as GMS,btohqsg
I will be more gay if bedok doesnt wreck bellcurve,btohqsg
bellcurve is always carried by some ppl,btohqsg
So is synapse gay for bedok?,btohqsg
The only common subject we have is english,btohqsg
I can confirm that the answer is no,btohqsg
Awh she didn't confess her true feelings,btohqsg
I appreciate the posts that are posted on the sub in the 2 months before november,btohqsg
Cus im pure science and he took emath last year,btohqsg
And he taking june paper but,btohqsg
I wonder if rsgexams is really the best place to be reassured,btohqsg
I got reassured of my death there,btohqsg
simply knowing there are people struggling,btohqsg
Yesfor me cos i see ppl being a troll and i realise im not that bad,btohqsg
But death comes and goes all the same,btohqsg
You know i dun study for humans one,btohqsg
humans is memorywork u must study,btohqsg
Yes put ur time spent playing with bots to good use,btohqsg
It must be damn stressful taking an exam with a sibling,btohqsg
in the end what matters is who wins an irl fight,btohqsg
I didnt even know viscous lava traps more gas leading to build up of pressure,btohqsg
Come  pick a time and place,btohqsg
If take Lit then you may not have to study,btohqsg
Just do the passage based question,btohqsg
You cant booli ur mei like this,btohqsg
He play with what bot sia,btohqsg
I‚Äôll win because I‚Äôll call polis and say dey riot  both arrested. Me have last laugh LOL.,btohqsg
Olympus Mons  in about 2 Eris orbital periods from now,btohqsg
Volunteer to be driver for elon musk car,btohqsg
Thankfully I think no police at the location I stipulated,btohqsg
Mine came within 2 weeks so u should check with apple support,btohqsg
I thought you just charge it and it‚Äôs ready to use,btohqsg
Duh  they don‚Äôt just fall from the tree in a shape of a pencil,btohqsg
For the record it's complimentary right?,btohqsg
I assumed process means the actual product is there already,btohqsg
I guess you have the new iPad Pro right?,btohqsg
Factories manufacturing the accessory could be shutdown,btohqsg
I receive long ago liao xd,btohqsg
shame that keyboard was not complimentary,btohqsg
Oof the one with the trackpad?,btohqsg
nah is keyboard built into ipad cover,btohqsg
What do you think of the keyboard?,btohqsg
Logitech  Brydge  and few other brands,btohqsg
Ik  but the trackpad and native connection is what makes it so much better than the Folio and competitors,btohqsg
Hard to watch show lying down,btohqsg
As long as it's not top heavy,btohqsg
I see it's the old Air,btohqsg
My macbook is a shitty 2014 one,btohqsg
Which has been the same design from the previous generations lol,btohqsg
Mediocre TN display and older hardware,btohqsg
My dad just ordered an iPad mini üòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
Fits the border of the ipad screen also,btohqsg
More powerful hardware and better screen,btohqsg
Takes more $$ to compactify things I suppose,btohqsg
iPad 10.2 processor is stuck in 2016,btohqsg
I rmber being happy to receive my macbook,btohqsg
Before i realised apple computers suck,btohqsg
iPad mini processor is from 2018,btohqsg
How did you notice it's not great?,btohqsg
Back then MacBook was a go to choice compared to windows laptops,btohqsg
i prefer using my pc anyhow,btohqsg
Unless i lazy and want attend zoom meeting in bed,btohqsg
Windows laptops are often better than new MacBook,btohqsg
That's because iPad has no competition,btohqsg
Only their OS is better (and price),btohqsg
ipad is just a bigger phone,btohqsg
Android tablet software support is in a sorry state,btohqsg
You look like a goof with the iPad charging the pencil sticking out like an elephant trunk waiting to snap off üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
And it rolls around because it's entirely round,btohqsg
BRB checking the price between the two,btohqsg
1st Gen pencil design is plenty of stupid,btohqsg
Pencil sticks to top of horizontal ipad tho,btohqsg
Ipad processor allows for virtual background on zoom,btohqsg
Does iPad Air and iPad mini count,btohqsg
My laptop fan has not turned on for years,btohqsg
At least you can show what you are holding,btohqsg
virtual background always fucks up around the gaps in hair,btohqsg
Only if iPad Pro 1st Gen is still available üòî,btohqsg
what is the echo u hear?,btohqsg
like when u call a phone and put both phones togethee,btohqsg
im thinking if there is only one speaker then probably wont have issue,btohqsg
microphone feedback occurs when the 2 devices are placed too close to each other,btohqsg
thus u will hear the feedback sound,btohqsg
cos ur mics will play to each other,btohqsg
usually if u use 2 next to each other  no matter the app,btohqsg
for actual classes with only one person unmuted probably no issue,btohqsg
nope la it sound be fine   u can do a sound check w ur mic,btohqsg
my mac takes 2 years to load up youtube,btohqsg
check the playback and hear if its weird,btohqsg
shld hv an option to check playback via ur output,btohqsg
wat earphones u use out of curiousity,btohqsg
i recommend using push to talk,btohqsg
either that or u try using w no earphones,btohqsg
see if its btr without the earphones,btohqsg
might be ur earphones ability to pickup the audio also,btohqsg
everyone has the potential to excel,btohqsg
i hope the audio pb gets fixeddd,btohqsg
why chem no passage based question,btohqsg
Hey! Anyone here know about Videography and photography? Please drop me a msg asap. Looking forward to meet new and exciting people here who share the same interests as me,btohqsg
The bots don't post in here,btohqsg

@mods: should probably restrict image permissions for newcomers in the group for 7 days  and auto delete any messages containing the word sgeducators,btohqsg
But can't do that on study chat cause ppl can't post qtns,btohqsg
y.. you'd trade sgexams for some money???,btohqsg
what's the going rate for advertising on our chat groups? 30 silver pieces?,btohqsg
if its 50 dollars a msg i do as well,btohqsg
Can't be that bad for newer MacBook since they all use SSD,btohqsg
But few lower end windows computers still uses a spinning hard drive üôÑ,btohqsg
Do they simuntaneously defragment during the update,btohqsg
how much does it usually cost if u break ur hard disk and u need to reinstall windows,btohqsg
Depends how old your laptop is,btohqsg
Samsung is a safe choice for SSDexcept for QVO,btohqsg
Or you can purchase your own SSD  disassemble the laptop and replace the storage  and install Windows on a USB flash drive for cheaper,btohqsg
Mine has both an SSD and hard disk  com still failed aft 1 yr,btohqsg
hmm im so confused im being charged 120 from my usual repair store and 240 from the store in my area,btohqsg
should i just upgrade to an ssd,btohqsg
assuming you have the budget uh,btohqsg
What can I expect from Asus?,btohqsg
its working fine since then tho,btohqsg
Assus products are unreliable and fragile,btohqsg
Apple is known for artificially slowing down older devices,btohqsg
To get you to update/get new devices,btohqsg
For iPhone  they claim it is to protect already-deteriorated battery health,btohqsg
Yeah  while not supporting replacement of said batteries,btohqsg
But I don't like how they slow down without disclosure of reasoning,btohqsg
Or even give it as an option,btohqsg
Some people can use the phones for alternative reasons or have theirbphones pluged in most of the time,btohqsg
Though at the same time  they provide security patches,btohqsg
oh damn so they force u to update and fix the vulnerabilities asap to reduce security scandals,btohqsg
Nah the main point is to buy more of their products,btohqsg
Especially if they make it so the older phones can't update,btohqsg
Huh? I‚Äôve never heard slowing devices down to get you to update  only installing mechanisms that would slow your device in an update down to force you to upgrade.,btohqsg
Hmm maybe I'm wrong about the updating part,btohqsg
Couldve sworn I read it somewhere but I can't find the source now,btohqsg

Client u would want to show progression pics,btohqsg
If not they would ask for constant updates,btohqsg
Boss u would wanna show final,btohqsg
If he busy ask u decide then u just show final version,btohqsg
If got time and stuff then give choices,btohqsg
Usually i never encounter boss issue hahaha only clients wanting to see progression pics,btohqsg
Yeah usually higher ups wanna settle stuff asap coz not much time. Thats why they put a lot of emphasis on succint and on the point info,btohqsg
Especially if its a new member hahaha,btohqsg
Buzhidao then hahaha but usually thats the case,btohqsg
But its like unspoken rule of business world uh.Indecisive clients : pick for them after gathering info dont let them know u gathering infoPicky clients u show them optionsAll clients u show them progression pics to let them know u are attending to themBosses: female bosses usually would want progressionMale ones give em final productIf busy give final peodict,btohqsg
This one as long as ur bro can prove the code/design is his,btohqsg

The work of a tru spai deleting your tracks,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs just my pet peeve  like why do we ppl with Asian names have to arrange our name in the western format for them to grapple which one is our given name  which one is our family name.,btohqsg
It‚Äôs as if we‚Äôre still second class citizens under colonial rule  that we need to make things easier for them. Instead of them accepting  different cultures and habits exists in the world.,btohqsg
I will set up Jung Hon and Hon Jung,btohqsg
You can ask western ppl to call you by your given name than your family name,btohqsg
