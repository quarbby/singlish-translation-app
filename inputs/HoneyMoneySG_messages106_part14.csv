yup! thanks for the reminder 😊,btohqsg
Diners qr can use dcs cards to pay meh?,btohqsg
Just apply again if u need visa version,btohqsg
So have 2 cards? N then cancel away the 1 u don't want?,btohqsg
Hi bros and sisters. Would like to check.. I heard revoult card can add visa   and pay for the silver membership.. is it worth compare against amaze paired with Citi rewards master card. ?,btohqsg
Yes. You need to apply n activate the new card first. Maybe wait for 2-3 weeks or 1 month later  then cancel the other. The purpose is for the new card to hold the pooled miles. If you cancelled MC first  then apply V  then the miles you earned from MC will be forfeited.,btohqsg
But if I also have uob Ladies Card. No issue right?My pnts will.remain right?,btohqsg
I'm still.waiting for the 48k miles for uob privi miles sign up bonus to be credited. So I guess can't cancel 1st anyway,btohqsg
revolut metal card u mean? Still need to topup wallet to use  topup no benefits and may incur fees. Not worth it,btohqsg
Perhaps you need to check if there is minimum period to hold the MC card since it is new to u. I guess you can’t get welcome gift for V since it is such a short period of time.,btohqsg
Does the same concept apply to other payment types for CardUp e.g. mortgage and MCST?,btohqsg
Understand that I need to upload mortgage loan agreement that shows monthly repayment  I guess CardUp wants to verify that the payment is indeed for mortgage.If split is allowed  do we need to specifically tell CardUp the arrangement or I can just key in the amount that I want.Example:Monthly mortgage = $3000Apply to pay via cardup for $2000 per month using card AApply to pay via cardup for the remaining $1000 per month using card B,btohqsg
Hm...I think can haven't tried  will need advice on this,btohqsg
Just voicing out my opinion lol  you want try can go try,btohqsg
How about Diners SG Pay with a 2% cash back from DCS Ultimate Platinum Mastercard?,btohqsg
I try many times but just can't add DCS MC/Union to the Diners SG Pay app  only Diners cards.,btohqsg
Diners sg pay doesn’t accept dcs cards. Stated clearly in the faq,btohqsg
Ah  you mean only diners club issued credit cards,btohqsg
And not the mc and unionpay versions,btohqsg
Aiya  thought can at least earn something while xnap is snapped 😭,btohqsg
Union pay qr seems to be able to be scanned by dcs app  but not sure if you get any rewards. Since someone say he want to try  see if he can provide any dp loh,btohqsg
Mine stuck like this for 2 days. Even though I top up $4202. Why ah,btohqsg
Did you buy $2 worth of insurance premiums?,btohqsg
There's a great tool calledheymax.aiyou can use. You should try it,btohqsg
You can try to visit petrol stations to reload TnG card with iChange card. You can try  some will say can  some will say cannot.,btohqsg
This might sound dumb but sg or Malaysia? 😅😅,btohqsg
Let me check. When I go boost coverage under accident category  I only have premium options of 30c 50c and 70c. Don’t have $2 option,btohqsg
Once you buy $2 of insurance then buy $200 of investment  etc.,btohqsg
Not sure what you're asking. Scan with Diners SG Pay app and pay with your Diners issued card.,btohqsg
Depend if u think market is overvalue which i think it is,btohqsg
If I use the Pay function under HSBC app to pay any other Bill  the receptionist in Raffles branch yesterday told me it is not eligible for 1%  cashback ? Not sure then how it works if u wanna pay AMEX and DBS credit card using HSBC EGA.The function pay has a list of most of credit cards and u can add them as payee... can someone confirm ?,btohqsg
YouTubers/media is the last person u going to believe them. The objective is to bring audiences so content is all to get ppl listen to them.That how to earn money.,btohqsg
Bull markets are built on pessimism and scepticism and end with extreme optimism and euphoria,btohqsg
Can have some references. But have own judgement.,btohqsg
Example. Lol. These few days find out several online celebrity oversea etc suddenly similar views as mine. And those I research long time ago. So I will say of course have some info that is good. But do your own research and have own judgement,btohqsg
But you inside a youtuber’s telegram 😂,btohqsg
Doesn't mean you can't have your own opinion,btohqsg
Oh ok. What did you mean?,btohqsg
Then I didn't misunderstand your point at allWhy does joining a telegram group imply you agree with everything they say? I agree it doesn't make sense to join if you don't like them or you don't agree with most of what they say. But is it not ok to disagree on some points?,btohqsg
What if you disagree with them on market sentiment  but you still like them  and you think theydobring value to your life? Whether it be entertainment  or they are knowledgeable in other domains?,btohqsg
Ok to argue if it's productiveNot sure if this guy is just trying to win or he's actually trying to discuss thoughIf it's the former  he can win. Haha,btohqsg
"We are both trying to make a point  aren't we? How can we discuss if we're not discussing different points? It's literally not possibleMy point was that  I think it's ok to be in a group even if you don't necessarily trust the ""main guy"" in certain areas. You may still like them  you may still believe they are entertaining  you may feel he's knowledgeable in some domains  but not others.You seemed imply that you must fully trust or believe them in like  everything. I was disputing this point (yes  I am trying to make a point here)",btohqsg
Both party Can stop. It's OK to have different view.,btohqsg
