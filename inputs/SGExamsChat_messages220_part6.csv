Hii  does anyone know when the form teachers would see the studentsâ€™ results? Would it be earlier on the same day or a few days in advance?,btohqsg
results are usually released via 2 modes  online and offline (in the form of results slips),btohqsg
Remembered being in the staff room on o lvl results day and teachers be gossiping over how well/badly some students did,btohqsg
Same day earlier so if youre anxious avoid all eye contact with all teachers,btohqsg
Your other subj chers will also see yours if theyre interested,btohqsg
unless the form teacher willing to share,btohqsg
My other subj chers all my class's results though,btohqsg
aka ur math teacher cant see ur chem grade simply,btohqsg
prob after o lvl results yes,btohqsg
on o lvl results day in the morning no,btohqsg
I mean like phy cher know your phy result,btohqsg
Some of the other teachers knew some students actual full results tho,btohqsg
ur subject cher will know ur subject result that he/she is teaching  but he/she wont know how u did for other subjects until like sometime aft o lvl results release,btohqsg
cos they will share thru a common ict platform,btohqsg
So the only way other subj chers will know your points is if your form cher tell?,btohqsg
