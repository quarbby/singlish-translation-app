Based on the age of your cher do you think that was before 2001,btohqsg
my teacher already 30+ 6 years ago,btohqsg

but enough to be studying before 2001?,btohqsg
If mid to late 30s as of 2018 then your cher should be referring to before 9/11,btohqsg
schools were always strict.9/11 event was during my J2 year btw,btohqsg
I remembered one event where somehow me and 2 other girls were in the sch in CCA rm for too late  closing up  before going for dinner.And the school gates were closed  so we managed to climb over the side wall over the gate to go out.,btohqsg
No one stopped us  dunno where the security guard was,btohqsg
is anyone int in going doh kyungsoo concert,btohqsg
I thought it was only because of 9/11 that public were no longer able to cut through schools as a means of shortcutPre 9/11 I heard the general public could cut through schools to cut short a route they were intending to walk to,btohqsg
I heard somewhere pre 9/11 security guards In school were like your industrial building security guardThey don‚Äôt stop you from entering but will question your purpose or destination briefly etc,btohqsg
nope  pri sch already cannot go inThose days pri schools were divided into morning afternoon sessionsWe also have lessons and remedial on Sat. Tuition was not as popular or widespread as now.,btohqsg
Oh isit? Interesting but what about sec school?And yea I know the divided sections cause my school went through the transition from divided to one session when I was p5 p6. They had to build one whole new compound to accomodate the influx,btohqsg
Like mine 10 year old still ok,btohqsg
hi can i ask if there are any peer evaluation for polys or they have completely removed? i‚Äôm in y1 but aft the projs there‚Äôs no peer eval üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
she said it was around sec 1-2 around there,btohqsg
Or you js saying that word,btohqsg

I dun even know how my parents deal w him,btohqsg
Neh the autistic one is my other brother,btohqsg
Idk what to do lah but im so‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I meant about how public can cut through  I mean till the end of my sec 5 I even saw parents driving into my sec school to drop off their kids for the pri school next door,btohqsg
Because my school and the pri school next door shared a gate and the traffic towards the pri school side was always packed,btohqsg
LOL R U SALTY CANT take a joke is it,btohqsg
ohhhhh I'm the one the one the one,btohqsg
Manjusri always got a simple roundabouts so cars can drop off and out  Maha bodhi pri the school next to us had a hotel like system where parents had to drive along the whole school to the back of the canteen to drop off kids then filter back out at the their side of the school,btohqsg
The best is maris stella primary‚Ä¶the cars block the bartley mrt drop off point and also just hog up 1 lane to queue to get into the sch / wait,btohqsg
It is gonna be much worst when it turn co-ed coz co-ed intake is always higher than single-sex schools,btohqsg
I think single sex schools are more problematic than coed,btohqsg
"u know female teacher that taught in male schools some students  be like ""I want to rape her""",btohqsg
"""isomer site of sg govt"" üíÄ",btohqsg
The top level domain is a government site,btohqsg
Check the DNS domain idk prima facie glance,btohqsg
1 more wk till study break,btohqsg
Comes from the mid 19th century: from Greek isomerƒìs ‚Äòsharing equally‚Äô  from isos ‚Äòequal‚Äô + meros ‚Äòa share‚Äô.,btohqsg
So in this case would still be a valid application of the term,btohqsg
so the isoceles triangle also comes from the isos ah i see,btohqsg
Alot of terms derived from the ancient languages no,btohqsg
