Lol I'm a Taiwanese haha I know,btohqsg
the interpretation of UNGA Res 2758 only transferred China's representation to PRC  smh never denied Taiwan statehood but somehow MONKAS,btohqsg
The aftermath of 2758 was a bs cuz CKS himself didn't make use of the opportunity to transition into an independent Taiwan but instead he clinched on to the delusion of being able to take back Chinese land.,btohqsg
i mean prob his fault that he tried to wank off to Project National Glory,btohqsg
he was really on the full on copium,btohqsg
should really make a edit pic about CKS on Copium,btohqsg
"""Taiwan is part of china Copium the mainland is not lost COPIUM""",btohqsg
can I use my 2019 H1 grade and not go for my H1 paper this year,btohqsg
yeah but ofc during the CKS era,btohqsg
it tried to argue itself otherwise,btohqsg
Coz they wanted to reclaim the mainland,btohqsg
They kinda gave up doing that so,btohqsg
so now got this political kerfuffle lah,btohqsg
I mean   technically they claim china,btohqsg
I mean roc Taiwan is a country,btohqsg
If u say no u prolly wumao,btohqsg
coz change the constitution entirely is china will come for you,btohqsg
I would like to debate im lazy,btohqsg
dropping ur claims entirely can be interpreted by winnie the pooh,btohqsg
I mean the ROC is already independent,btohqsg
Oh screw econs I hate econs,btohqsg

Just study like 2 hours daily,btohqsg
Poly u need to socialise too,btohqsg
High chance u need to do grp project etc.,btohqsg
Practicing socialize is a good habit  so that when you're in internship or working  you're able to do your work efficiency  especially when your project requires teamwork,btohqsg
And sometimes you need to let other people know what you're doing  so that if you're not around and need someone to do your work  that person can straightaway know what to do,btohqsg
