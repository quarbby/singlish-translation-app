nothing  just curious to know how its calculated,btohqsg
Based on how much you owe (billed).If the amount owed multiplied by their stated interest rate is lower than the minimum flat fee  then they charge the flat fee only.Else they will charge you both flat fee and interest.They will always charge a finance charge separately the moment they charge you a fee.Please always pay in full  on time.,btohqsg
never ever borrow from cc. else really deep shit.,btohqsg
cus ive seen several different ways of it being calculated. never always the same,btohqsg
I think bank staff ever told me it is xx%  ie. 27%  of total amount printed on the bill. Not the outstanding amount. Hopefully I remember wrongly. Perhaps divided by 12?,btohqsg
Try this formulaTotal bill printed amount x 27% x (51/365)Is it very close to your amount?It is either 50 days or 51 days.,btohqsg
Does anyone know the EIR for OCBC 360 for salary+save below 75k?,btohqsg

Avoid ba. Else do DBS block card method. Or amaze block card method,btohqsg

Anyway hsbc revo $1k cap…. Not enough for wedding? You need multiple cards,btohqsg

is there a way to apply for that card? i havent reach the salary limit to apply for that,btohqsg
i do not have a uob acc as well,btohqsg

ok i will try this method,btohqsg
Just try to apply UOB Lady's Solitaire only.. at most they reject for salary requirements lor,btohqsg
Charge $1 to your existing card n call CSO to find out the mcc will be the best. I believe your spend at this merchant will be huge. Be thick skin than sorry.,btohqsg
