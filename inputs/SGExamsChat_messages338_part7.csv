Typical interview questions:Idk how applicable is this for EAE lah but can be used for job interview also ig.1. (95% hit rate) tell me more about yourself2. Where do you see yourself in 5 years3. Why do you want to join us (usually it's learning opportunities or values that click with you)4. What do you know about us (for EAE context probably what do you know about the course)5. Probably some related questions to your portfolio / resume / experience6. Strengths  weaknesses (do not go r/iamverysmart. For weaknesses  include ways that you have tried to alleviate the weakness).7. Work-style (meticulous vs big-picture  fast-paced  analytical thinking  etc)8. (more EAE related) How did you gain an interest in whatever you're applying in (pretty related to 3 I think),btohqsg
For number 4 please make sure you know about the course. I've had a fellow interviewee for an applied chem course say he wanted to be a forensic scientist but the job scope he mentioned was of a pathologist  so he stumbled twice already since the course does nothing about pathology  he stumbled a third time by using CSI as his inspiration.,btohqsg
"General guideline  try to put yourself in the shoes of the school or interviewers.""Why should I take this student  instead of the 100+ other students who are also interested? Do they know what they're getting into? Are they suitable? What have they actually done that shows their suitability better than others?""",btohqsg
This is good.For any potential interviewees  this are standard questions asked in interviews. Always prepare for these questions.,btohqsg
I find suitability a big pointer so yea they can find 100001 to ask about it  list definitely by no means exhaustive,btohqsg
