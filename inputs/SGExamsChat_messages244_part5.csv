Some of you asked me for tips for 综合填空!I don’t have a foolproof method but here are some pointers:1. Don’t spend more than 10-15 minutes here! Questions with heavier weightage are at the back2. Read through the whole passage first if possible - this is to ensure that you have a food understanding of where the passage is heading to which helps you to eliminate some words that are more context-specific!3. If point 2 is not possible  do at least read through the paragraph because some of the clues to the questions are not directly before or after the question!4. When you are unsure of the answer  do elimination method first before attempting to guess5. Good to go through past year papers to get a good 语感 for 词语配搭Do share this with your friends and all the best to you kiddos!! 🥰,btohqsg
