I said I'm already here  staff told me food is preparing. Was told by llm this bor bian  is the merchant told them cancel. Then just cancelled.,btohqsg

hello if anyone is interested in good lobang/deals compilations  found this helpful channel@sgdivedealsto follow ☺️,btohqsg
If your in good luck  there is pick up for same restaurant same destination and must be same timing. If not  stack nearby within 5-10mins drive to same destination.,btohqsg
Luck is the key word. Now with less jobs n more driver need luck to get jobs to stack,btohqsg
Also traffic is not like during lockdown times. Nowdays is back to heavier traffic. More time consuming,btohqsg
So keep that in consideration if ur stack goes far distance  especially during peak period,btohqsg
