Oh shit man thats ur pic,btohqsg
Do you want me to take it down?,btohqsg
But damn man i loved this pic,btohqsg
Isit lose interest in the comm,btohqsg
not a bus enthu but that pic is fire,btohqsg
But yeah true thats why i set it,btohqsg
at least yall get to look lah what the car look like,btohqsg
its dif from the ig post,btohqsg
i guess theres more teachers who are car enthusiasts in my school,btohqsg
but my fren fr said its my teacher one leh,btohqsg
i forgot all abt my bus enthu phase sia,btohqsg
but like tdy don have dk why,btohqsg
ok guys turns out my teacher actually has a mrs but that one is not his,btohqsg
THATS THE SAME LICENSE PLATE AS MY TEACHER ONE LEH,btohqsg
EH MY TEACHER MABUK OR WHAT,btohqsg
his ig post got mrs with that exact same license plate,btohqsg
did my teacher forgot about owning a mrs,btohqsg
He just dw u go scratch his car,btohqsg
but only three shots looked good,btohqsg
note that im a beginner so if photo not good tell me whats the problem then i will take another photo shoot tmr if the car there,btohqsg
i left the school edi üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
as long it looks good to you it doesn't matter. everyone's opinion of a good photo is different.,btohqsg
since the adjacent parking area seems clear maybe you can back up a bit to get a nice 3/4 shot of the car!,btohqsg
had to squeeze a lil bit,btohqsg
by that i meant like there was not really much space,btohqsg
i took some other shots too,btohqsg
but didnt think they looked good,btohqsg
Anyway it's like what was said here la,btohqsg
You'll improve with practice and experience,btohqsg
When I did my first video edit I was using a camera and not my phone and thus couldn't get many good tracking shots on the car,btohqsg
And the worst thing of all was I forgot to film in vertical,btohqsg
So we'll get better over time by evaluating ourselves,btohqsg
Non toxic feedback. Your angle here crooked,btohqsg
Try using a level or grid lines in your camera app,btohqsg
I FORGOT TO TURN IT ON,btohqsg
not rly my style but will try it one day,btohqsg
If you're focused on vertical then step away a little,btohqsg
To give more foreground and background,btohqsg
Wouldnt really say its orange but rather tan,btohqsg
Yo green + tan interior tho,btohqsg
It was the same as this,btohqsg
There's something with these Heineken lamps,btohqsg
Tan slightly darker and more brown,btohqsg

F1 tickets are out super early in the year,btohqsg
f1 ticket price range 70-90 right,btohqsg
The cheapest zone 4 walkabout ticket is like,btohqsg
last year wanted get was arnd 70+ sia,btohqsg
and the f1 is for 3 days,btohqsg
You can choose to buy single day,btohqsg
Got one zone 4 ticket released at 68 for Friday I believe,btohqsg
Been going for a few years already,btohqsg
ahh i think shld be that laa,btohqsg
wanted buy two for me and someone else,btohqsg
that someone else wasnt free doe so i didnt buy,btohqsg
instead i watch at mbs AHAHAHA,btohqsg
i just listen to that v6,btohqsg
if yk can dm me persony,btohqsg
But ltr they prob gonna cover,btohqsg
But helix is blocked as it's an entry gate for zone 1,btohqsg
prolly the best view i cld find but yet it was still like a small glance,btohqsg
But Mayb they will this year,btohqsg
Probably will because this year the track in that area is a bit different,btohqsg
fuckit la ill just buy a ticket this year,btohqsg
The most value for money ticket is premier walkabout,btohqsg
You get access to all 4 zones and have a lot of stands to sit and watch from,btohqsg
gosh AHAHAH NAH NOT DOING THAT,btohqsg
You can get a single day,btohqsg
If you just want the atmosphere,btohqsg
rather save for license or pray that someone give me ticket,btohqsg
Oh you don't have a license yet?,btohqsg
no luh i still 17 bro,btohqsg
Sunday is the most action  claimed to be the best concert,btohqsg
yuh ofcourse sunday raceday mahhh ofcourse,btohqsg
aye but thanks for telling me broüôè appreciate ur help,btohqsg
Compared to zone 4 walkabout which only gives you access to essentially the concert zone and 4 to 5 standing areas that are always like a can of sardines,btohqsg
This is the cheapest one btw,btohqsg
Apart from that there's seats as well in different areas but different prices and you're stuck to the seat and the zone around,btohqsg
Unless you buy a nicer grandstand which gives you all zone access as well,btohqsg
that shld be fine w me luh  not spending so much on a thing thats not physical at this age,btohqsg
this one all when i older laa haha,btohqsg
But it's an experience to have,btohqsg
if f1 wld still be a thing in the future,btohqsg
Especially if you have friends to go with,btohqsg
wld definitely be for any enthusiast,btohqsg
I think even if you're not into motorsport,btohqsg
Track tv telling you about stuff,btohqsg
And the Singapore gp attracts a lot more tourists than others,btohqsg
i went in 2017 and 2018,btohqsg
So you get to meet all sorts of people,btohqsg
i wish to relive them all the time,btohqsg
im gna go back to the sggp next year,btohqsg
this year focus on N lvls so üò≠üò≠üò≠ might as well save up for t1 grandstand,btohqsg
F1 tickets can be free if you work for f1 ü§úüèΩü§õüèΩ ite lads look out for f1 x ite collab,btohqsg
Really gonna be sad missing it this year,btohqsg
Except you don't actually get to be inside watching usually,btohqsg
spending a lot of $ this year already,btohqsg
No i actually worked at T2 Grandstand last year,btohqsg
i go if u still in sg,btohqsg
I got to watch it as well,btohqsg
i alr go last year HAHAH,btohqsg
The ite and poly jobs get to be at gates checking tickets  selling tickets  etc. usually,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just the standing part that might kill u,btohqsg
even though its jst zone 3 and 4,btohqsg
it was fun 4 me   didnt go any of the concerts tho,btohqsg
Wah nice  you got a good spot,btohqsg
ok but last year concert meh,btohqsg
yeahh 2022 concerts werent really a good lineup,btohqsg

Black eyed peas was not worth it on Sunday,btohqsg
cos of that i didnt even get to go for the fanatec race thing LOL,btohqsg
We saw the rain coming in behind,btohqsg
of all the days i queue for it when im at the front then rain come,btohqsg
I had to run like 2.5km to get to my spot,btohqsg
I wasn't watching the padang one thankfully,btohqsg
Only watched Marshmello and Westlife there,btohqsg
the rain on sunday was damn bad though HAHAH especially if you were at zone 3   all packed under the bridge,btohqsg
Yea .. day 1 (2 days be4 race day)  working lewis hamilton   carlos sainz and vettel walked right behind me . We were human barriers . That‚Äôs why i said ite lads to look out for this opportunity,btohqsg
Ah zone 1 technically can walk to driver gates,btohqsg
