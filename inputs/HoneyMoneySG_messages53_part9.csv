So just join the Q to buy one plastic bag  then leave the counter n comeback again for another plastic bag?,btohqsg
I meant it as a joke.But if u seriously desperate to clock transactions count  pls save face and go self checkout during ulu hoursU need scan + payRepeat 5 timesDonâ€™t silly and scan 5 times pay 1 then that counts as 1 transactionPls donâ€™t q at the aunty there say want to do this. She will bombastic side eye u and also u will confirm come out on mothership news.,btohqsg
If anyone intend to be famous. Can do so. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
FYILast time ShopeePay voucher is the cheapest thing u can buy in Singapore$0.01 only.Now they removed that. So the next cheapest thing u can buy is $0.05 plastic bag and this counts as groceries spending.Now u might think why is this info useful?Well  if u have credit cards that u donâ€™t frequently use but donâ€™t want to cancel  then itâ€™s good to clock at least 1 transaction on it per month. So the bank deems it as active.This is what I do on my UOB Absolute card. I clock $0.05 per month and can get waiver of annual fee lol(Maybe partly coz I also got UOB one and very guai spend on that? Who knows),btohqsg
I think saving the environment is nonsense for normal ppls. The rich ppl waste much more. I remember watching a news that says the private jets for the rich eject more pollution than our normal everyday life...,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s ongoing debate on this plastic bag thing also.They donâ€™t give plastic bag  then u have to buy. End of the day the cost about the same. Giant sells 100 small plastic bag for $4.50. Each $0.045. Ie about 5 cents also. Just that Supermarkets now earn side income.,btohqsg
Yes! they just want to make more money hahaha. They should sell bags made of cloth rather than sell plastic bags.,btohqsg
i bring my own disposable plastic bags,btohqsg
This plastic bag thing is akin to the courtesy chair on the mrtIt nudges people to be aware but impact very very low to the environmentIf letâ€™s say ntuc publishes how much $ they collected from plastic bag sales; this just tells us a whole lot of people heck care the initiative.,btohqsg
Honestly kudos to those shop that provide plastic bag as needed but sell the extra requested. It's the actual take only what you need concept.End of the day  these disposal plastic bags are not single-use whereby people bring home their groceries and throw the plastic bag after they unpack. Especially Asian households  these plastic bags will definitely be reused whether to become trash bags or reused to carry other stuff.,btohqsg
That time I paid for the plastic bag and luck has it the aunty put my things in then made a hole.Then my scum bag mind told me to ask her for another one then my conscience kick in and told me to save the environment.I paid $0.05 for a broken plastic bag that day. Go home I patched up the plastic bag with masking tape coz too poor to afford another one to use as rubbish bag.,btohqsg
Value$ gives plastic bags and charges on extra ones!,btohqsg
Another thing is like why we need to take responsibility for saving environment. We lose poor life if the world come to end. But reach ppl will lose cozy life.,btohqsg
Exactly. A few are like that. But if you buying something small and brought a bag  if can reject the bag best reject... Honestly small bag can't fit much rubbish also. ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
America should use electricity car since co many cars in USA causing global warming.,btohqsg
People online say for town council to be prepared people just throw things down Rubbish chute without plastic bag,btohqsg
If your own carrier bag too big then the thing u buy small  then u come into this situation where the bag has too much space lolLooks like u carrying a diaper.Might be good to carry different size bags.,btohqsg
A lot refuse to change from ICE car because they believe they can't go far with electric car. And also because they treat old cars like vintage... And not forgetting cars are cheap.,btohqsg
Everyone should but itâ€™s still expensive to own one.Also the electricity to charge the car comes from mostly non-renewable sources,btohqsg
Actually electric car is not expensive  donâ€™t focus on Tesla,btohqsg
Car = expensive regardless ICE car or electric car. But yeah got affordable electric cars like BYD  Nissan Leaf,btohqsg
For SC e$aver Jun-Jul promotion  need to go to bank branch to apply or can apply online via ibanking/app?,btohqsg
Nice . Ok I get both .So what use what ? Can give me a list ?,btohqsg
So I managed to go to sp group Svc centre and swipe $300 to pay bill beforehand. The process is a bit tedious though can be done. They need approval to swipe large amount.Now regret not swiping larger amount. Seems like eventually I must Ntuc voucher,btohqsg
Not worth if you are aiming for miles,btohqsg
Any thoughts of using Citi PayAll for reno cost?(The ID firm I engage doesn't have credit card payment),btohqsg
Anyone knows whether there is any card that we can use to pay for renovation and earn rewards point?,btohqsg
In many countries  this is not new  even in Indo,btohqsg
At least those ntuc plastic can be reused as garbage bag.I hate those real estate flyers shoved into our mailbox. Wasting papers,btohqsg
Self checkout la. And do 5 txn,btohqsg
Can apply online using myinfo. I applied on 1st June quite fast,btohqsg
Only get cards when there are sign up promos.For Sc smart  pls see their TnC online for list of merchants.For HSBC revo  their 9x points are given to a broad based list of merchants. Pls see TnC online for list.HSBC revo cannot use for bus/mrt. Some services like haricut at certain salons not counted for 9X as well. Things like utility bills also not counted I think.These 2 cards are good for newbies to credit cards.Once u can spend a minimum per month  u can consider other credit cards. Then the HSBC revo and SC smart can be backup.I think itâ€™s better for u to focus on what u spend on and plan accordingly. Itâ€™s an art but once u figure out  itâ€™s an amazing feeling.Then come back to this chat to ask specifics. Eg u list your cards then ask the community if certain spend is best to put on which card.Best not to ask community open ended question like how to spend.,btohqsg

Will the transactions billed in Jul that was incurred in Jun be considered under Q2 cashback? I.e Shopee  SimplyGo,btohqsg
NO. transactions billed in Jul that were incurred in Jun will not be considered under Q2 cashback.,btohqsg
I see. So those posted and billed in Jul is under Q3 already?,btohqsg
Yes  thatâ€™s correct. Transactions posted and billed in Jul will be considered under Q3 cashback.,btohqsg
Can someone teach me or send me a link or something on how to invest in REITs? Really want to add it to my portfolio but seems daunting. I currently have a moomoo account and I'm investing in stocks there. Is the process of investing in REITs similar?,btohqsg
