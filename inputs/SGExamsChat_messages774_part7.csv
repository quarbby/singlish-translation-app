A Temasek JC student is among at least 2 people killed in the multi-vehicle accident in Tampines.https://str.sg/kYwk,btohqsg
Was the driver drunk? He was driving very erratically on the road leading up to the junction,btohqsg
But my Condolences to the family & friends of those who passed. üôè,btohqsg
A 17-year-old girl & a 57-year-old woman died in the Tampines accident this morning.8 other people were injured  including 2 11-year-olds.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/4b5nVG2Follow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
"Straits Times writes so clearly in the headlines ""A Temasek JC Student"" üò≠",btohqsg
Estimated speed of driver entering junction was 120kph,btohqsg
That's like double the speed limit on normal roads (50/60km/h),btohqsg
Calculation was done based off distance of light pole to the bus stop and a dash camera,btohqsg
And I hope that all is well and everyone gets better,btohqsg

the girl that passed away  the mother works at my pri sch,btohqsg
i feel it's more than that  150kph or greater. but just my guess,btohqsg
he didn't even step on the brake,btohqsg
scarier thoughtIt's an EV whose brakes programming failed,btohqsg
But that doesn‚Äôt explain why the car is speeding in the first place,btohqsg
Wasn't there a taxi that did exactly that idk if it was a ev tho,btohqsg
disclaimer  just thinking aloud:the failed software bug might have happened earlier  and when he steps on the brakes  it accelerated instead,btohqsg
but it's not an ev though so what is this about?,btohqsg
it's just a random thought of things that could happen,btohqsg
not necessarily that it applies to this,btohqsg
