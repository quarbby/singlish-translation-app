Hi guys  sorry just need some advice  I have an upcoming >$4000 gain city aircon spend.

Some other options are new dbs altitude amex and get 21k milesOr just use my ocbc titanium,btohqsg
are you chasing miles or cashback?OCBC Titanium Rewards would give you 4MPD on that S$4K spend16K miles can get you somewhere within Southeast Asia on Business Class SQ especially during Spontaneous Escapes promotion,btohqsg

Hi everyone  anyone knows whether itâ€™s possible for Google Pay to earn credit card cashback via scanning QR code? Just now I tried scanning QR code and it linked me to Bank account  was wondering if I missed a step in configuring my Google Pay,btohqsg
Just saw sms on citi bank rewards on 3.25% cash rebate min spending 3k sgd on foreign currency. I have no other credit card and I going oversea tomorrow. My hotel spend is more then 3k was thinking to take advantage of it.,btohqsg
only can charge to linked bank,btohqsg
what QR code did you scan?,btohqsg
Try to explore if can use Kris+ to  pay travel agent eg. CTC  on or before 30 Apr to earn 4+3 = 7 mpd up to maximum $1k spend using HSBC revo.,btohqsg
For PayNowQR it will deduct from your bank account (not from credit card). You should still get the GooglePay (Pay UEN) promotion though,btohqsg
After 01 May  it will be reduced to 1+4 mpd = 5 mpd,btohqsg

I can only find this paper formhttps://www.iras.gov.sg/quick-links/forms/other-taxes-and-services/giro-application-forms,btohqsg
https://help.ipaymy.com/en/articles/2515162-what-can-i-pay-with-ipaymy- it says Insurance (excluding NTUC Income),btohqsg
Does this mean whichever kind of QR I scan  itâ€™s impossible to deduct from cc? i.e Mobile contactless is strictly Tap/PayWave kind of transaction?,btohqsg

Does your insurer accept Amex? If yes  Amex TCB and UOB Absolute still gives cashback for it. Otherwise  Maybank platinum visa still gives cashback for insurance payments but you must hit the quarterly tier. On the miles side  Maybank VI gives 1.2 mpd. If you don't qualify for that  UOB KF debit card gives 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
I see thanks - will look into these...,btohqsg
if u dont mind paying a little extra  use citi payall. they are running a promo currently.,btohqsg
