Does klook purchase using DBS Live Fresh card eligible for the 5% online cashback?,btohqsg
lucky for you. I had tried to apply online to open EGA account. It said that I was ineligible to open. I have a Revo CC btw. Left my contact details on their website  no response for 2 weeks. Contacted via app. CSO say I have to go down to a branch to open  as only users with deposit accounts can apply online,btohqsg
So best advice would be to open EGA account tgt with HSBC Revo application online,btohqsg
this need top up and use from wallet - not link cardplease note top up no rewards/rebate for most cc,btohqsg
Seems like instarem is pushing hard on the use case for their own wallet ü§î,btohqsg
Any idea how to proceed on opening HSBC EGA account? Not sure why I cannot open account,btohqsg
Do you happen to have a Credit card with them? Else  probably better to visit a branch and ask bah,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt mind I ask what‚Äôs the current promo on ega account ? Is the step up interest still available for next quarter ? Got sign up bonus?,btohqsg
HiDown payment for car can get cash back or miles?Which card for cash back? Which for miles?Thank you,btohqsg

what credit card offers good cash back for mrt  fast food and online shopping?,btohqsg
What do I need to take note of when I'm saving up for my HDB flat? I'm not planning to get married. I'm a 26Female. I recently set a goal of 100k cash to set aside before quitting my job and persuing my passion.,btohqsg
That would be the SMART card from Standard Chartered. Except the online shopping part. You could get another card for that alone.,btohqsg
oh  hmm need to have separate card. which card has good offer?,btohqsg
do you know how many percent is the cash back for the SMART card for public transport?,btohqsg
what about if taking grab or cab?,btohqsg
How much u intend to use on reno/furnishing all those for a start.. And for housing wise how do u intend to pay for it?,btohqsg
Can see revolution card HSBC. 2.5% cashback,btohqsg
Oh good to know.But went down to branch is immediate opening of account.So see which one fit your schedule i guess,btohqsg
I plan to use 10k-15k renovation for a 2 room Flexi flat. I could pay in cash as much as possible then take up a loan.,btohqsg
nice  so for the points i can convert to cash or how does it work?,btohqsg
what other benefits that SMART citi offers other than for public transport?,btohqsg

Hi does anyone have suggestions for transport card. I am waiting for NS currently and am 20,btohqsg
Do you still have student rates on your student ezlink card?,btohqsg
I used AMEX SQ and got SQ miles,btohqsg
Since you're under 21 you won't be able to apply for credit cards. DBS Visa debit card and UOB One debit card give 3% cashback if you can hit $400 and $500 min spend per month respectively,btohqsg
If you don't spend that much a month  you can use SC Jumpstart debit card for 1% cashback.Also  Revolut occasionally has promos for bus and MRT rides cashback that you can look out for (will be announced in this grouo when it happens),btohqsg
Just curious but will this affect the moneysmart promo in the future,btohqsg
Thanks. So amex got miles. If mine is cash back should have too right,btohqsg
It won't affect your new to bank status for credit card applications if that's what you're asking. But you'll miss out on bank account opening promos in future,btohqsg
But it may have cap of cashback u get.. Just try to find the T&C,btohqsg
SC Jumpstart account doesn't really have any signup promotions so that one should be safe to apply anytime,btohqsg
Already have that but wanted something more. Is new to bank bonus usually large?,btohqsg
No. Highest I've seen so far is Citi Plus at $100 last time,btohqsg
wow this offer is good. Valid for Cardup?,btohqsg
So new to bank holder is usually only additional $100 or something around there?,btohqsg
If you're first time buying get hdb loan is cheaper than banks. I'd recommend continue working and clock your cpf. Cash is liquid. You'll never know when emergency hits.,btohqsg
Most of the time for student accounts it's $18. E.g. OCBC Frank and SFL Vivid,btohqsg
I mean for new to bank while getting credit card usually the rewards difference between new to bank and new to card is only $100,btohqsg
Banks usually don't give signup rewards for existing account holders to open a new bank account with the same bank,btohqsg
Fully redeemed. Thanks boss for reminding :D,btohqsg
I wondering if amaze allows for my wife and mine amaze card to link to same credit card?,btohqsg
No  cannot. Their tnc state that you need to be the owner of the card that you link to amaze,btohqsg
Open HSBC ega. Moving fund over and ask ocbc to kick my a** goodbye.,btohqsg
My partner link with my credit card to her amaze. It works for topup to wallet and direct transaction. But if link to 2 amaze card/ account not very sure.,btohqsg
What is so attractive in hsbc ega?,btohqsg
May I know anyone know the answer ? I‚Äôm not sure that I‚Äôm right or not about the EGA Bonus interest 4.3% actually there is an additional 1% Everyday+interest will be credited 14 days after each month ended eligible upon 5+transaction on the account and another EGA 4.3% bonus interest will be credited on the fulfilment date which make it total 5.3 %,btohqsg
Ocbc need salary credit and save bonus to hit 4%. HSBC ega no need. The only downside is the reset every few month.,btohqsg
