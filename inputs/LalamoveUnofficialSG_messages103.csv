My guess is because their Govt subsidize like Siao. Because if they don‚Äôt  people feel in kampungs or ulu areas will have a big problem affording it  it‚Äôs probably meant to help the neediest level to be able to move around. If not  they‚Äôd be stuck in their ulu kampungs. That‚Äôs my observation when I was doing bicycle touring in Malaysia obviously before Covid.SG I don‚Äôt think there is any subsidy at all.,btohqsg
Hmm  unless a car specifies high octane  otherwise it‚Äôs just wasted money for a premium that no one needs.High compression ratio  then would require high octane. Lots of sources online too to countercheck.,btohqsg
Their subsidy is only for grades below 97 I think.. that's why foreign cars can pump grade below 97. But the prices for 97 is still damn low?!,btohqsg

If your in good luck  there is pick up for same restaurant same destination and must be same timing. If not  stack nearby within 5-10mins drive to same destination.,btohqsg
Luck is the key word. Now with less jobs n more driver need luck to get jobs to stack,btohqsg
Also traffic is not like during lockdown times. Nowdays is back to heavier traffic. More time consuming,btohqsg
So keep that in consideration if ur stack goes far distance  especially during peak period,btohqsg
