Not 100k won't get full 5% interest.,btohqsg
Yes 2 lines as per your screenshot,btohqsg
5% per month is ah long’s rate🤣,btohqsg
May I check also  when will uob release back the 50k to my balance? I signed up this uob one account and got the $250 bonus. But dunno why the bank “capped” away my 50k.,btohqsg
I think other got mention before,btohqsg
Earmarked for 4 months. Assuming yours is the July-Sep cycle,btohqsg
I see. Thanks a lot. So the 50k will only release around Sep-Oct period?And  so this 50k will be considered into my monthly average balance too?,btohqsg
hello fellow money savers...what will be the most optimal approach for a big ticket overseas spending to earn the most miles? (E.g >$10k spending)I was thinking: AMAZE -- OCBC Titanium rewardsLow FX rate + 4MPD?Is my approach correct? Or are there any better options?,btohqsg
Morning sifu...Now DBS revised their perks for booking airline. no more 1 $ = 3 miles.May i know what other card can i use?,btohqsg
UOB lady card with travel category.... 6mpd no fight,btohqsg
"haha that one stuck under ""dining"" lol",btohqsg
Ocbc tr is only for certain mcc  please check it before use. Uob vs give 4mp up to 2k spending but there is foreign currency charges.,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc up to 2k spending or uob krisflyer i thinj,btohqsg
but doesnt amaze transactions count as online spending?and OCBC Titanium gives 4MPD for online spending?,btohqsg
i just deposited into poems as well  got the same display as yours.wondering does this mean smart park is working and 30 day starts now?,btohqsg
No  it is mcc related still,btohqsg
Thanks Sifus... Sian.. attitude capped at 5k.. just nicefor my SQ,btohqsg
hmm then which card will you recommend to both enjoy AMAZE low FX + reap credit card miles benefit?,btohqsg
The thing about UOB KF  is that for travel it's restricted not by MCCs however. So only some airlines/platforms may apply,btohqsg
On Philip MyWealth app  my enets cash deposit is reflected in my live cash balances  but the Smart Park screen shows 0 value. Perhaps need to wait a while before they will deploy my cash into the smart park,btohqsg
U need to spend 800 on sia or scoot or krisshop first  the bonus miles also only credit after the anniversary and u might not be able to waive off the annual fee.I cancelled and uob kf coz they insisted me to pay annual fee and i end up cancel and forfeit all bonus point,btohqsg
wa okay..means the miles will not come in so quickly,btohqsg
Ouch. that hurt.. hope is not alot of points,btohqsg
unless you using on SIA group (3mpd directly on next statement month),btohqsg
else  1.8mpd comes in 2 months after AF,btohqsg
That is ok  learn lesson loh. I can earn miles on other good card haha.,btohqsg
Does that mean directly buy air ticket from Malaysia airlines  Cathay Pacific  etc…. Will not qualify for 3mpd under UOB Krisflyer?,btohqsg
yep. Will be funny if they did given it's a co-brand card 😂,btohqsg
Apart from that I think got no other high mpd Mastercard that can pair to amaze alr for travel spends lol,btohqsg
"seems like DBS World 4 miles per $ for ""online""later i call them to double confirm SQ.. before i  use",btohqsg
so just to confirm my understanding shifus...say i wanna buy a $10k product in Japan.Using AMAZE-UOB KF...12k miles upfrontbalance 18k miles will come in later within the next 12months?,btohqsg
point expiry 1 year - DBS.. waliao..,btohqsg
I enrolled Hsbc EGA in March for that 4 months high interest promo. It’s already August and I haven’t received interest for this account. Does anyone has datapoint for this? Hope hsbc does not con people into putting large sums $$ into their bank and don’t pay interest 😅😅,btohqsg
Mcc must still fall under the bonus cat  japan merchent often give funny mcc,btohqsg
but im spending through amaze no?,btohqsg
Please read the chart ppl shared earlier,btohqsg
wouldnt the bonus cat count under AMAZE? and not the japan merchant?,btohqsg
ah okay... i see i see. got it liao. still dependent on the MCC regardless whether using AMAZE not,btohqsg
terms and conditions stated by end Aug if I recall correctly.,btohqsg
Amaze only convert it to online transaction  underlying mcc still apply,btohqsg
Transactions are still marked as amaze. Lots of cards nerfed their promotions for amaze transactions,btohqsg
are klook purchases excluded from crmc?,btohqsg
This question is a bit tricky. How you buy the Japan product? What is the product? That decides if it is qualified 3mpd.,btohqsg
sorry one more noob question. anywhere i can find out what MCC represents?,btohqsg
its ok we are here to learn. Merchants generally dont publish MCC or are willing to share but you can find a merchant (or shop) MCCusingheymax.aiwebsiteMCC = Merchant Category Code,btohqsg
Heymax is for visa mcc  mastercard might allocated mcc slightly different,btohqsg
Some Japan merchants do not follow what displayed by Heymax which is international standard.,btohqsg
looking at buying a watch from those reseller shops. haha,btohqsg
Heymax is also not 100 percent accurate  take it with a pinch of salt.,btohqsg
Most accurate is use the dbs method. Block the card  pay then use the digibot to verify,btohqsg
