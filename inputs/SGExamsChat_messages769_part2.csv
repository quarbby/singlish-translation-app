ntu ddp/double major is not that hard to get in tbhâ€¦mostly 80+ can liao,btohqsg
No but it's q funny cuz apparantly she got caught for this cuz she posted on IG a bunch of stories abt how she pays taxes,btohqsg
Then when someone went to check if she registered her business apparantly she didnt,btohqsg
what career uw go? will it need both deg,btohqsg
And that's how she got caught,btohqsg
Is that a new thing in the new h2 syllabus,btohqsg
i mean itâ€™s 5 years but per sem still the same,btohqsg
dam 5 yrs? normal single deg is just 4 yrs right? depends ig,btohqsg
still dk leh  tbh itâ€™s quite unlikely to find smth that needs both lol ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Oh does it it seem harder than what was removed,btohqsg
usually 4 years  but if u go ntu biz/acc should be just 3 years,btohqsg
Then you also showed how she and her team marks essays with rubbish comments lol,btohqsg
Cannot go against state narrative that RI students can fuck up,btohqsg
do u do part time job oso? or ur parents help u pay,btohqsg
Nah it has been approved for Leong Mun Wai,btohqsg
Or maybe anyone now since the minister said RI is a bad sch,btohqsg
roughly how much in total estimate?,btohqsg
also depends. if you are lower or middle-income  can get bursary  and there are like 4 categories u can fall into based on your family income lol,btohqsg
Might be easier to smoke liddat. For last yearâ€™s essay qn for theme 2 I literally smoked everything for IO cos I didnâ€™t study it not thinking that itâ€™ll be tested,btohqsg
Luckily I still could rmbr some stuff,btohqsg
I feel like there's just alot of redundant shit tested,btohqsg
idkâ€¦at first i thinking of going govt but now not sure lol,btohqsg
Did the new syllabus trim that down at least,btohqsg
didnâ€™t she have a plagiarism one,btohqsg
Also if I become an moe teacher I have to think about whether to do geog as my second subject since moe expects 2 subs nowadays,btohqsg
like she copied some other tuition teacher,btohqsg
I think her centre is popular only cos of her looks lol and maybe she turned it into some kind of elite socialising club,btohqsg
what women have u been around,btohqsg
She has the makings of a business student,btohqsg
I was talking to my friend,btohqsg
Like ppl go there to see her,btohqsg
she is not good looking at all tf,btohqsg
Abt how she looks like anabelle,btohqsg
i think even i teach better,btohqsg
Idk then I know some guys in my sec sch that kept talking about her at some point,btohqsg
even tho i suck at the actual subject,btohqsg
So diff ppl got diff tastes,btohqsg
"She hosted a banquet for her students cause ""gp deserves luxury""",btohqsg
no her comments to her students,btohqsg
If can silence all the bad comments then everything is good or so she thinks,btohqsg
I hope her business implodes soon,btohqsg
she might as well be on lemon8,btohqsg
with the amount of copium and retardation there,btohqsg
damn why she nvr go local u,btohqsg
A bit strange she didnâ€™t go to a sch thatâ€™s considered Ivy League if she wanted to go to the US,btohqsg
Saying this goes against state narrative,btohqsg
True even with 90rp she probably still needs other qualifications/portfolio stuff,btohqsg
According to SG all RI students are good enough to compete at an international level,btohqsg
But idk ah I thought in general non Ivy League unis in the US would not be as good as nus/ntu,btohqsg
Does this sound like I'm salty abt RI students,btohqsg
