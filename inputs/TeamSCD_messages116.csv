It looks cool when you open the hood,btohqsg
Don't think you'll go from TT to rx8,btohqsg
The reason it has a series 1 kit although it is an RS model,btohqsg
Is because after the accident could not source a replacement. So they used series 1 kit to rebuild.,btohqsg
That being said if u check the chassis is straight  can buyover and redo the kit to something nice anyway.,btohqsg
Err no. There was a war today,btohqsg
Hi boo. Miss u as always,btohqsg
AM shift reporting to work üòÇ,btohqsg
Night shift they don‚Äôt sleep lol,btohqsg
I'm wondering this Sunday will jb be jammed,btohqsg
Haven't gone in a few weeks üòÖ,btohqsg
No need if going weekend dont need,btohqsg
Renew like 2 months ago still waitingü•≤,btohqsg
Gerard what colour calipers would u spray for my car?,btohqsg
Don't spray  just change in future,btohqsg
Spray still okay la just dont put fake caliper,btohqsg
This the one place you can spray red,btohqsg
Euro r stock calipers should be similar to yours,btohqsg
I prefer the colour to be from the brand of the calipers,btohqsg
I want endless  the blue like shiok  only,btohqsg
Like mine is project mu  so their colour is always like a turquoise colour,btohqsg
That way people see the colour they know,btohqsg
I mean mine i plan to do candy red so i guess red is normalü•≤,btohqsg
But for me I wouldn't bother,btohqsg
I had mine with the sticker of the logo half fallen off for a year already,btohqsg
red wont go wrong ba haha,btohqsg
I waiting for my friend to scrap his car den I can take over his caliper,btohqsg
Ya haha..still 4 or 5 months later,btohqsg
Nono candy red it is for me,btohqsg
S5 stock brake to my car,btohqsg
If the fitting all ok should be a nice upgrade,btohqsg
I want candy red slightly more glossier,btohqsg
I think alr have thats why got that glossy look,btohqsg
"his ""option"" rims  dun so bad la",btohqsg
Ya lor what to do all wamt me to offset,btohqsg
I still thinking if I want to change my brake pads... So that it has more bite,btohqsg
This you need to ask some wheel expert if it's recommended,btohqsg
I like to keep my car inspection ready... So I won't do it,btohqsg
Even though I need to remove the quick release,btohqsg
Mine is f1 brake light need takeout,btohqsg
For me install also I don't get to see it in use,btohqsg
2 tail one wing one f1,btohqsg
scared ppl bang ur behind ah,btohqsg
Then got the reflector red thing also so 6ü§£,btohqsg
Your car got very questionable stuff,btohqsg
Hahaha hellooo all stock from honda only f1 brake lightüò≠,btohqsg
So must question honda not meü§≠ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Ya I always found that generation a bit too much,btohqsg
Its just cause its longer compared to fd thats why,btohqsg
Fd looks boxy cause small but fc is stretched,btohqsg
Then u have fe new one,btohqsg
The front of the car ok  can look very nice. But the back not sure what can do,btohqsg
Next lvl 2 diff cars into one,btohqsg
Jkkl mine dw to follow that just keep it as civic,btohqsg
Put any kit but the type r,btohqsg
Because yours not type r... Don't be poser,btohqsg
It's the issue I had with civics,btohqsg
Spend so much buy type r  but every civic also look like type r,btohqsg
Haha ya ikr a lot of aftermarket one,btohqsg
Best is the one where civic go and do the triple exhaustüò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Best is like rx8... Just 1 only,btohqsg
Series 1Series 2RS  spirit R and type S aka premium versions,btohqsg
But at least their more or less same specs,btohqsg
Between series 1 and 2 the SKU are hardly interchangeable,btohqsg
Oil cooler injectors etc all different,btohqsg
The 1st gen need to premix right,btohqsg
Yes unless a sohn adaptor was installed,btohqsg
I read the rs then they fixed it,btohqsg
Series 2 needs it less  but still nice to do it,btohqsg
Ultimately its all about lubing the apex seals,btohqsg
It either comes from the eo or from your fuel,btohqsg
When you premix is it just engine oil pour into the petrol tank or use something like 2T,btohqsg
Also it kills the car right,btohqsg
Dont anyhow add something that creates a lot of deposits,btohqsg
That time when researching I remember reading somewhere about it's not good for the cat,btohqsg
A lot of the so called bad experience with rx8,btohqsg
Comes from 2 things:Cheaper or wrong alternative (skimping)Delaying or ignoring maintenance (skiving),btohqsg
I figured I could make it work.... I wanted it to work but the feel not there then,btohqsg
We had an owner  dunno stingy or cashflow problem  used a $69 oil instead of the rotary spec oil that is around $160-$180. So what happen  engine temp rise  the oil cannot handle it  degrade. The deposits damage the seals  the coolant enter the engine. White smoke. Workshop. ‚ÄúOh no rx8 is unreliable‚Äù.,btohqsg
That $180 oil last how many pumps?,btohqsg
Referring to engine oil. 5k servicing change,btohqsg
Oh... Then something wrong with that guy,btohqsg
The premix u can use spc 2t which i heard is fine,btohqsg
I thought he savings on the 2t,btohqsg
I like chloe to drink good stuff so i went motul 710,btohqsg
Yeah always go for the good stuff,btohqsg
Engine oil is‚Ä¶ dont f around,btohqsg
wahhh 5k interval is short also,btohqsg
Mine I hear different things about different oil,btohqsg
I also do it Abt there,btohqsg
6 months or less I change already,btohqsg
hmm i change every 3 months,btohqsg
5k is okay ya  keep the engine fresh,btohqsg
Thinking if I want to try a different LSD oil this time,btohqsg
when i drive wrx i used HKS,btohqsg
Engine I'm running Castrol edge  LSD cusco,btohqsg
EO change dont go by duration  go by your mileage better,btohqsg
now play little bit can le,btohqsg
Like if you step out of a evo9,btohqsg
hahahah thanks for the compliment haha,btohqsg
He is saying u look like zhuo pian,btohqsg
wait till you see me in full racing suit as if hahaha,btohqsg
wei i dont piang like Zhou de hor,btohqsg
He got the decent beng look,btohqsg
The bengs who made it kind,btohqsg
Where you normally go for lunch,btohqsg
Today i quite early awake so can go makan,btohqsg
ermm can be nearby coffeeshop   PLQ   Suntec,btohqsg
Geylang side should be near you,btohqsg
We go Sims drive the market there la,btohqsg
tdy can meet up if anyone is free as tml i flying off liao,btohqsg
See what time your lunch break,btohqsg
Sounds good... We go at 12 then,btohqsg
i tink anything below 10k wont harm engine,btohqsg
I usually park the road side lots,btohqsg
The inside carpark always must see luck,btohqsg
actually ang mor countries they go by 10k miles,btohqsg
15k abt 6 months for me,btohqsg
U service = healthier engine + better fc,btohqsg
Yeah  but generally 10k is more than decent la,btohqsg
How long you take to hit 10k,btohqsg
Like that do 6 months easy to remember,btohqsg
Mine every time I do  the car gets a full check see anything leaking all that,btohqsg
mine too...its good to do preventive check,btohqsg
The last time I did we found my gasket leaking,btohqsg
i vry scare of leaking...so i will get all pipes and wear and tear renew or change,btohqsg
Garage R normally alr include their dk 22 point check or what,btohqsg
most workshop do the general check de,btohqsg
Previous car go for servicing  then my friend tell me suspension leaking  straight I tell him ok time for coil overs.... He like shocked I happy it was leaking,btohqsg
But I wasn't happy when they found the exhaust leaking on this car,btohqsg
That one was I dulan then order new,btohqsg
Ang mo country their car piang  they leave it by the roadside and buy another camry for 1k pounds,btohqsg
See whether wanna follow ang mo,btohqsg
They can buy junkyard engine put in,btohqsg
Of course never follow la. But i'm just saying  if they can do 10k miles  we 10k KM is more than enough.,btohqsg
but of course you got money to do 5k change then go ahead la.,btohqsg
The climate is different..Sg too hot and humid le,btohqsg
That's why better to change more frequent,btohqsg
For me if I'm free I can happy happy just go down ask them change stuff,btohqsg
Mine from thick oil just changed to leaner oil as i reaching 100k,btohqsg
Euro r you buy all sky high,btohqsg
Yours car how old my car 4 years onlyyy 100küò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
This is why we run thicker oil ma,btohqsg
I think mine is a 2008 model,btohqsg
Not me raymond from project s,btohqsg
He say i need start using thinner oil compared to my thicker one last time,btohqsg
whats the reason ah haha. 100k mileage drop viscosity,btohqsg
u use thinner oil alr gt see better fc?,btohqsg
normally ppl higher mileage run thicker oil,btohqsg
he made you run thinner oil,btohqsg
like hoping your engine piang liddat,btohqsg
as long got 30 i tink ok ba,btohqsg
Nvm after this is servicing at honda alr let them do everything,btohqsg
I just stick with honda alr,btohqsg
As much as I know what the car Manuel recommend is the best,btohqsg
Power  my tyre keep losing air but ytd go check no leaking,btohqsg
Previous owner nvr went to honda,btohqsg
If they say w40  u stick to it is the best,btohqsg
ppl here sure know good ws ba,btohqsg
As in for parts all those since under warranty i bring to honda,btohqsg
But servicing i still looking for one,btohqsg
You need to have a workshop that you will always visit,btohqsg
oo yeah if gt warranty juz use,btohqsg
Like workshop that you comfortable with,btohqsg
Actually important is you comfortable with the mechanic,btohqsg
For mine servicing at 100k next will be 575üò±,btohqsg
Piston and rotary different ba. But i see eg6 owner also go by 5k,btohqsg
Depend on how dirty your oil gets,btohqsg
At 5k when they drain it  i see like machiam crude oil come out,btohqsg
You ok or not change oil 575,btohqsg
I cant imagine that being circulated,btohqsg
I mean  u can buy plugs from stockist and do it yourself,btohqsg
I don't trust they will change all,btohqsg
End up putting low grade stuff,btohqsg
It looks like honda authorised ws he is going,btohqsg
the rest stated prob just check,btohqsg
Yeah like honda mandai service centre,btohqsg
Then they will not do funny shit la,btohqsg
hahaha no la i did red. pink is take from carousell prank friends lol,btohqsg
They change 4 things engine oil  oil filter  spark plugs and 4√ó4 transmission oil and maybe air filter,btohqsg
SEAT service centre got kena before.. tyre rotation stated but nv do. the person go back ask they say oh see not needed. dog 1.. nv do dun state,btohqsg
but i nv kena la  they rotate for me haha,btohqsg
Yeah only reason why i want go to them is they do hondas so if any issue or the one right now i facing accele issue hopefully fix,btohqsg
gt ask ur civic same model owners ma? haha ask them for test drive see is it their cars dun have,btohqsg
Actually if not needed then it's ok la.. Just means not time yet,btohqsg
You need to really tell all the problem  if not you'll get the car back with the same issues,btohqsg
Sit with mechanic and drive out,btohqsg
But what issues y‚Äôall facing on fc5?,btohqsg
Cause my 1.6 got this draggy electric noise at around 1.5rpm,btohqsg
Draggy electric  this description abit weird,btohqsg

Yeahh true. My 10k drain out HKS it's still golden. Idk issit good or bad.,btohqsg
Shld be good? Means its a clean burning engine,btohqsg
Idk  some people tell me it could be also the oil not cleaning your engine well enough,btohqsg
but it's HKS la. I trust their products,btohqsg
If it's some unknown brand of oil doing the same  i'd be worried,btohqsg
