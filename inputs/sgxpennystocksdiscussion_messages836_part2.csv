Many did not realise in the the polling letter that there is a Priority Q for the seniors. Please  let your loved ones and friends know there is a PRIORITY Q for seniors over 60yo  Handicapped and Wheelchair bound.Those polling staff were more concerned about checking the poll card to ensure voters were at the right venue.Inspite of someone feeding back to them  nothing was done to redirect them. There was no signage and a lack of initiative in directing the seniors to the Priority Q at our polling centre.,btohqsg
Senior 60 & above please ask for Priority Q,btohqsg

"Who is behind the discharge of Fukushima NUCLEAR CONTAMINATED water?Forwarded:[30/08  19:02] In the war of aggression against China in the year 1900  it was not the Japanese government that first initiated the conflict with China  but a certain company. To put it bluntly  it was a Japanese company now renamed as 'Tepco'.Many people may not know about Tepco  which is responsible for the discharge of nuclear sewage in Japan. Tepco is actually an ""American company"" like South Korea's Samsung.The largest shareholder of Tepco is BlackRock of Wall Street  and the second largest shareholder is also The pioneer of Wall Street  and Japan's own Nomura Asset Management is only the third largest shareholder...So can you understand why the Americans are silent in this incident? Because the affairs of Japan are the affairs of the United States. The decisions of the Japanese government and Japanese companies are the decisions of the United States.The United States launches any form of ""war"" against China  whether it is a trade war  a technological war  a biological war or an environmental war... Japan They are all loyal lackeys and pawns.The whole world is already at war.[30/08   US is using Japan in a proxy war by getting Japan to dump nuclear wastes near China and then ban all Jap seafood to make US absolutely safe from radiation.",btohqsg
