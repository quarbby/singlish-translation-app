"""We like what is given out in the food packs. The items provided help us cut down on living expenses so that we can spend on other things like medical bills.” - Lim Geok Kheng",btohqsg
For Lim Geok Kheng  a beneficiary of Food from the Heart  eating a proper meal can be a luxury. Lim Geok Kheng is plagued with kidney failure  and is too feeble to continue her job as a factory cook. She even has to cook her own meals seated on a chair. Her husband Law Cheng Huak  74  rushes to shuttle her to and fro dialysis thrice a week before work. Food from the Heart supports the couple with consistent rations comprising fresh fruit  eggs and bread  as well as non-perishable food items like rice  canned food and cooking oil. The steady source of food not only alleviates their financial burden but also provides a greater peace of mind.Like Mdm Lim  there are many needy beneficiaries out there that do not have enough money to have a proper meal  as they need the money for critical expenses such as utilities  school fees and medical bills. Your contribution will truly help them a great deal. Let us do our part to help those in need during this trying time.Donate via this link:www.giving.sg/campaigns/foodfightersFollow Food from the Heart to find out more about what they do:Facebook: Food from the Heart (Singapore)Instagram:@foodfromtheheartsgWebsite:https://www.foodfromtheheart.sg/#SGunited#FoodFighters#FoodfromtheHeart#FoodfromOurHeart#Donatethe600#GiveFoodDoGood#HelpFoodTheBill#LetsDoOurPart,btohqsg
