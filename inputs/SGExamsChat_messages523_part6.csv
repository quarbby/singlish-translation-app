If u wanted such a thing you would have sticked to A-levels,btohqsg
So u thrive under stress or you don't I damn confused rn,btohqsg
Even if u screwed up C in PW is still fine,btohqsg
So u need a goldilocks zone of stress?,btohqsg
Look here's how I see it personally I thrive under a lot of stress.. and if I succeed you know its something to brag about but my strategy have a pretty high chance of suicide especially in the months leading to Alevels,btohqsg
it's ok i made a lot of mistakes this year,btohqsg
I mean you understood and took a step back and that's admirable,btohqsg
ys be telling me that with my l1r4 i could have entered nyp common biz but i ended up in rp,btohqsg
I don't know how to take a step back tbh,btohqsg
Yeah I have never stepped back and just push forward always one even when I was in the hospital for some less than ideal reasons.,btohqsg
The thing is that in my strategy it's either I make it I currently mostly do.. or I end up dead which is kinda irreversible,btohqsg
No.. I put my eggs in multiple baskets but each basket falls short of the minimum amount required meaning I need to work overtime,btohqsg
Been doing that since 2020 retook every year since then,btohqsg
It's like living a double life and both sides of that life u cannot tell friends from either side cuz you would just seem like a crazy maniac,btohqsg
I mean I can say now la but I would have to go out of my way now and tell them the real reason,btohqsg
Which I ain't got time for so I am just gonna let them think it's cuz I lost interest for the course,btohqsg
A 30-40 qns quiz  qns come from lessons you took till quiz day,btohqsg
yea bro definitely deleted the messages,btohqsg
Cuz he's the owner here but in SUS there's just him being bedok,btohqsg
I still dk what I doing for 20m,btohqsg
Means u hit the study wall liao,btohqsg
I think I confirm c+ or lower alr wtf,btohqsg
and I have a paper Tmr in the morning,btohqsg
Then what rp = retarded poly isit,btohqsg
better than tp students broi got threatened by tp students in the tp chat a few days agoi just said a joke and then they threatened to leak my irl name and reddit accountand then used my bio to take a jab at me,btohqsg
tp students attitude quite bad im pretty sure,btohqsg
It's okay I hated TP w a passion,btohqsg
and the fact that most of my sec sch classmates went thereand also there were 3 sec sch classmates of mine who insulted me that time,btohqsg
uhh that‚Äôs also cos u started a fight in the tp chat,btohqsg
and then said that they know me irl and if i don't take my words back theyre gonna expose who i am,btohqsg
literally the people involved in that argument were all from rp LOL,btohqsg
i said rp as ite north only dude,btohqsg
I wonder where is that bumble bee kid these days,btohqsg
i legit didn't even argue with anyoneand then just said this poly is bad from my experience only,btohqsg
they were replying me repeatedly after i stopped talking then that one dude saying ‚Äúu scared ah‚Äù or some shit,btohqsg
That one already considered as controversial alr,btohqsg
those involved in that fight where mostly rp students,btohqsg
really shouldn't have said it in a public chat tbh,btohqsg
i only dislike that poly because most of my sec sch classmates who used to bully me heavily went to that poly,btohqsg
they most likely gg to ignore me if i text them,btohqsg
bc they don't like me sk,btohqsg
i also dw remember who they are anymoregive me trauma bro,btohqsg
more like they just accept fate that their gpa like that,btohqsg
but to be fair tp is second closest to my house after nyp,btohqsg
mine is my sec sch classmates all went to tp,btohqsg
and sp alsoa lot of my sec sch classmates went there also,btohqsg
yeah truesome people very good at studying but their attitude very siao,btohqsg
my sister told me that she had a classmate who was arrogant and wanted everyone to listen to her but had the best grades in the cohort,btohqsg
Na these usually is pwn sinkie type so they get good GPA by pwn their own teammates,btohqsg
