Cuz telegram is build on that privacy shit,btohqsg
i think that's why people were saying on reddit that its better to create group chats for project work on whatsapp  that way you can save the evidence easily,btohqsg
Yeah this mf would when the entire group using WhatsApp randomly dm on tele,btohqsg
I found the weirdest fire truck in Singapore  let’s see if anyone can guess what the purpose of this truck is,btohqsg
tele works quite differently between platforms,btohqsg
oh damn my parents wont buy me an iphone honestly,btohqsg
uhh ok idk if it’s my friends phone specifically (it might be),btohqsg
Why do have a compulsive urge to put my parts in that,btohqsg
but like for secret chats  when i delete i can only delete it for both of us but for them they can delete it for js themselves or both of us,btohqsg
looking at the big thing on top it's definitely to spray water onto civilians like what the french fire fighters are doing to the french protestors right now,btohqsg
US be like:Ever tried tear gas?,btohqsg
you can delete other people's chats too,btohqsg
You know u don't really need to use rubber bullets,btohqsg
that's not a thing in whatsapp right,btohqsg
whatsapp chat is locked to your device,btohqsg
WhatsApp only can delete your msgs,btohqsg
And that's a new feature last time cannot one,btohqsg
next time right if yall have group/team work with teammatesmake sure to create the group chat on whatsappso you wont have to be afraid of the evidence getting deleted by other people,btohqsg
Imagine you call scdf and this is the fire truck that turns up,btohqsg
The truck looks like a toy,btohqsg
Na I too paranoid to give them my number,btohqsg
so let's say if you want to report your teammates slackingyou have the chat evidence but sometimes they can delete on tele and all,btohqsg
Nope it’s a human ventilation truck,btohqsg
wont have this sort of thing ever again for me so i guess,btohqsg
well it happened to me for a modulei wanted to report to my lecturer about my teammates not doing work and i scrolled through my messages in the tele gc,btohqsg
then i realized they might have deleted it,btohqsg
tbh if i collab for a research paper i might just remember to use whatsapp in case of authorship disputes,btohqsg
but we usually use email anyway so,btohqsg
I would take a guess and you don’t know what is a human ventilation truck,btohqsg
It's usually the 17 year old lol,btohqsg
It grinds the air and create oxygen for humans,btohqsg
no bro i had a teammate who's 22 years old she went to nitec and higher nitec,btohqsg
That is the purpose of the truck,btohqsg
and took 1 year gap or some shit,btohqsg
why is that even a feature on tele,btohqsg
Bruh I got old teammate 22 yrs old finish N’s alr and flung his poly years,btohqsg
is that why the people on reddit were saying to create gcs on whatsapp specifically,btohqsg
I can’t believe you actually believe that,btohqsg
so that can collect all the evidence,btohqsg
Haha  it was a joke lol,btohqsg
yep will do that next time,btohqsg
and the fact that your phone number cannot hide also,btohqsg
i got like 23 nitec higher ns,btohqsg
No but the truck was a truck used for ventilation  the barrel you see was fan or sorts,btohqsg
i encountered a pedo from rpi reported to my mentor but he said that since he does not have his phone number he cant do anything about iton tele can hide phone no too,btohqsg
next time will just tell them to create on whatsapp lor,btohqsg
the dev actually explained why he did it,btohqsg
then if they say why i say got encrypted,btohqsg
Then you got ppl getting WhatsApp messages asking if they are the person’s telegram name,btohqsg
So I can see why they removed it,btohqsg
