you could repartition your main drive to fit ubuntu inside,btohqsg
if your drive has enough space no need for an extra one,btohqsg
Its got enough space for now but ill be needin the space soon,btohqsg
while each os has their own partition  you could also do a shared partition between linux and windows as a common space to put your files in  to maximise space,btohqsg
even scarier  so the easiest method is still a new driveðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I did the external drive thing with my laptop  when the hard drive got shaken a bit/the USB loosened everything went haywire so I stuck with the internal drive,btohqsg

Anyone here knows anybody that can review resumes?,btohqsg
I know one  but I don't know how much he charges.,btohqsg
if you are thinking of professional one,btohqsg
if basic one  I don't mind doing for free to look through quick,btohqsg
Usually help my own students to quickly look through. Mainly to spot potential errors only  that's about it.,btohqsg
Can I ask you for it,btohqsg
Sure can I send you tonight,btohqsg
Sure  you can pm me the resume.I will see it as soon as time permits.But have to bear in mind  I'm really not a professional at it. It's really more of just to ensure all the basics are covered  and whether I feel weird reading it  which is what you don't want potential employers to feel.,btohqsg
If you want a professional resume review  can PM me too.,btohqsg
is it up to 3 choices of any sch for eae ?,btohqsg
