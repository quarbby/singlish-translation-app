Go 1st time no space  to go 1 more Rd waste alot of time,btohqsg
Must wait for +$ n surcharge then worth it mah. Cover cp,btohqsg
No wonder so many car jobs in cbd not taken.. n merchant reluctantly add surcharge then got ppl take,btohqsg
Surcharge not enough cos will deduct commission,btohqsg
Wait for +6 n above lah,btohqsg
But alot of pple gan cheong n want take job at any price. Most park illegally n cheong  but if kena summon then how,btohqsg
Need do how many such jobs at risk of summon again to cover 1 summon,btohqsg
Anyway just don't do the cbd jobs if not prepared pay cp or kena summon. Cbd no foolproof place to park without paying,btohqsg
I only saw one time MBS job got $8 surcharge added.. this user must hv known parking ex so add in this fee automatically,btohqsg
Gov cover all angles to make money,btohqsg
$8 also not alot. Cp go in if I'm not wrong is 6 or 7,btohqsg
Despite distance so short.. from 1 office twr to another twr less than 300m also nobody dare to take,btohqsg
$14 after less16% bal how much liao. u parking then deduct bal how much. WOrth,btohqsg
Price so little deduct liao wats the pt,btohqsg
Marina one to 168 robinson also nobody take.. until merchant Dulan increase$6 or $8 then got ppl take,btohqsg
High demand surcharge not enough 1,btohqsg
If distance short n can complete with 30mins then still ok lor,btohqsg
But collection n drop off still need time,btohqsg
If high floors  or buildings need u register etc,btohqsg

Correction  many many drivers out there will take anytg nowdays,btohqsg
Not so lao jiao.. add up all together less than 10jobs,btohqsg
I do town n cbd usually,btohqsg
Cos I usually wait for good prices. But nowdays no have +$ or surcharge  or maybe +2 4 only then pple take,btohqsg
Last time only need factor in cp n time cost,btohqsg
I tried to take surcharge job then I slow finger .. job taken by others,btohqsg

For me  doing part time lala is cover some cost and a little bit of pocket money,btohqsg
Doing full time  need to really calculate your overheads to see if worth it or not,btohqsg
If want do ft  need to clock quite high mileage to earn a decent amt now. Cos less n less jobs with high prices. With the rising petrol costs  have to weigh the mileage n hours clocked against the income. Unless u have hybrid car,btohqsg
So part time lalamove car is still viable to do?,btohqsg
just do it and u will know  ask also no use de\,btohqsg
I will be blunt. Too many drivers  too many part timers joining now. Either to get the petrol discount or to just do abit to supplement income. On wkends where we used to expect higher volume of jobs nowdays harder to get jobs cos:1. Lesser orders cos open up liao. Pple either go out eat or go malaysia2. Recession. Economy bad. Tighten belt.3. Alot of drivers just take whatever jobs that come out. Regardless of the pricing. Of cos its their own personal choice  but when prices so low  deduct comm n petrol liao  earn so little  its not enough for full timers. But for part timers who just want cover abit of their weekly petrol etc  they do. Also they want clear mission  so just take whatever is out there.,btohqsg
In a way  the mkt is now skewed towards restos n users having advantage over us. N will continue to be like that. That's y nowdays more n more unreasonable job requests  n will be like that,btohqsg
Above is my own opinion  so if I offend any1  apologies,btohqsg
when i do  i dun even ask whether is it viable to do it. i just do it. everybody has a different view of what is viable n also every day has different delivery. mayb suit u or not. every day is a different day too. Dun need to ask just do it when u want it. Asking is useless. If u are scared dun do,btohqsg
u where got scare de  u old bird,btohqsg

The member who deserved to be boot is Â§ß‰∫∫...he really think that he is Â§ß‰Ω¨?! So rude & arrogant whenever newbies asked Q.,btohqsg
Sorry to say this. But Ban of boot is for scammer. Sad to say if everytime have to ans newbies question might as well go lalamove do customer service,btohqsg
The whole idea of this group is for people to chat and even  ask questions  be it newbie or not. Yall know customer service for LLM is not immediate. There is no need for discrepancy as such  every one started out new at some point.And on the point of the bot abuse  on top of the complaints I have received from other members  if they are to keep banning themself and to ask me everytime to unban themselves.. I'm gonna be really busy. üòÇHence I do not entertain these silly requests.They have created a new sub group and have been poaching from the channel  members can exercise your own discretion whether to join them.The removal of members earlier since yesterday  are related to the incident and has been placed on a ban indefinitely.As this incident comes to a closure in this grp  Let us move on. üëç,btohqsg

They don't really care always siding with the customer. That was 2 years ago now still the same.......,btohqsg
Wah why amk go pick an order at changi,btohqsg
Ya it's v far. Shouldn't pick up orders which burn excessive petrol just to pick up,btohqsg
Max for me for pickup is 7km,btohqsg
i think the cost to benefit ratio doesn't make sense hahaha,btohqsg
and tbh not very fair to the customer also üòÖ,btohqsg
if u were the one that ordered  be it food or taxi  you wouldn't want your driver/rider to be 20km away right... hahah,btohqsg
To me is opportunity cost. Have a target price not anyhow take.,btohqsg
Some people too kanchiong. See only faster take. Scared no jobs.,btohqsg
Traffic is bad nowadays. Try to take less than 5km away job. Sometimes 5 km already take 10 to 15 min to drive to.,btohqsg
Sometimes rather sit still and wait for correct job than anyhow take and end up petrol and parking eat up everything.,btohqsg
Is there any referral for referring new rider to lalamove?,btohqsg
Hey guys  i wanna ask  is it worth renting a car and doing lala? Are the orders able to cover the rental?,btohqsg

Why people want drive for delivery ah,btohqsg

Can consider hovering around city fringe but now NDP period abit tricky. Then again you're bike so shd be ok,btohqsg
Try to stack logically and strategically to maximize ur earnings,btohqsg
BTW  if I get the order at 9am but I only manage to reach at 930 due to traffic  they send and claim I'm 30 min late.... I thought we have 30min time to pickup,btohqsg
Anywhere should be ok but hot spots are commonly known at geylang,btohqsg
So don't take orders that are far away,btohqsg
Any car workshop midnight got open in jb,btohqsg
The road leading to KSL has some workshop opened till late last time . Now after covid not sure if they still operate till so late .,btohqsg

Poor IKEA Raymond from GOGOVAN hiding in Stirling road multi storey carpark. Because banned from going into IKEA...too cruel already and always complain about drivers resulting in suspension and termination. What goes around always comes around. Kudos to the promoter at IKEA Alexandra who made him banned from entering so drivers gets their fair share of orders.,btohqsg
Hi Driver Partners!Due to power outage  there will be a slight delay in response from a Customer Service Agent. For any order / further enquiries  do write in toinfo.sg@lalamove.com. We apologise for the inconvenience.,btohqsg
Write email waste even more time. üòÑ,btohqsg
Does anyone know what is the penalty for lalamove if late?,btohqsg
I realised that lalamove is really siding customer instead of us. There was once i encountered delivering a food. Despite calling and knocking on the door  no one answered. Put it outside.,btohqsg
Note: only one bag of food which i went to ask the food vendor how much it cost: $6.,btohqsg
However the customer claimed that it was $40+ and i had to pay for the lost food which i placed it outside the person's door.,btohqsg
Appealed but lalamove doesnt care at all and just deduct from wallet.,btohqsg

Den she will give u low rating n perhaps llm will give u a 1 day suspension lol,btohqsg
Best is dont accept this job,btohqsg
Normally see so many criteria... I don't take up...nothing to lose,btohqsg
Sticker can choose to stick back only?,btohqsg
Didnt know can choose to stick back only. Thought must stick the sides also,btohqsg
I van cannot see motorbike job,btohqsg
For car i think both sides compulsory,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt take this kind of jobs. Their commitment to their customers is 1 hour delivery. If it is a multi-stop then it will be impossible to deliver if u kena traffic jam  receiver not at home etc. They will complain u and you need to answer to LLM.,btohqsg
they don.t care one....I stop already,btohqsg
Whoever is taking this job   pls take care n drink water ! Also looks like raining soon!,btohqsg
Yes legit but it's just another group  same thing,btohqsg
Wah‚Ä¶..$4500/ month. But din say every month. üòé,btohqsg
That's about 15 jobs a day  nonstop.,btohqsg
Plus all jobs are concentrated around lunch n dinner with almost nothing before 10am or after 10pm... Don't think 15/day is possible even if really want to try.,btohqsg
this one patrol car all no need to pay...talk like stupid,btohqsg
Anyone know for bikes if we go ubi buy lalakit  do they help install?,btohqsg
