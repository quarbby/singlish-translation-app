Do u think is good to leverage on annuity?,btohqsg
i think those who use loans to pay for their insurance policies are crying now.No way their returns / crediting rate can be above their Premium Loan rate now.,btohqsg
around2020-2021  many insurance agents were pushing their clients to take Premium Loans at about 1% p.a. to pay for Whole Life plans that purported to yield 4-5% p.a.,btohqsg
Whole life locks in for long period,btohqsg

Does anyone know the MCC for the Sony store at Wisma?,btohqsg
I checked heymax for instarem amaze. It shows MCC 4829. Then I saw MCC 4829 is excluded in the Citi bank thank you pts. Does it means that citi rewards cc is removing/nerfing Instarem amaze?,btohqsg
on top of the substantial commission they earn  they also earn ur loan interest while dumping the interest rate risk on u.,btohqsg
Wow. Still got this type of bs  products. Insurance agent do everything to get their commission. üòÇ,btohqsg

No. I‚Äôm thinking of applying for citi rewards CC and want to make sure it‚Äôs not nerfing instarem amaze.,btohqsg
Amaze will pass down the MCC of the merchant to your citi rewards card,btohqsg
You will only get MCC 4829 if you're trying to remit money overseas on Instarem app using your citi rewards card,btohqsg
Oic. Thank you so much. üòäüôèüèª,btohqsg
This was on 2020. But my point is when the agents pushed they never warned clients the loan rate can shoot up.,btohqsg
