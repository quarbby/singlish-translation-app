I was asking the dealer this ytd,btohqsg
When U see BMW u remind urself of blhe,btohqsg
U see ferarri u remind its iconic color is red,btohqsg
Whats the first color that comes to ur mind?,btohqsg
Oh yah but Yellow abit like ferrari leh,btohqsg
WAIT.  What is Audi iconic colour??,btohqsg
@Jiaweeeeegrey with red words (if there are words) hahaha.if not just red?,btohqsg
Orange! Loving my orange so far and not very common,btohqsg
atlantic blue touran comes to mind,btohqsg
After bodykit goes up  the next thing you know  you need that slightly lowered stance as the icing on the cake haha,btohqsg
This one confirm one. I actually think it’s way more than just icing on cake man.,btohqsg
Everything so swee but the gap big will be a bit like wearing Prada tie but length in front until mid thigh.,btohqsg
Yeah I agree too. But our roads sometimes jialat la. I’m only on lowered springs and a lot of places scraping already,btohqsg
But I go to a lot of construction sites too so it’s borderline off-road sometimes haha,btohqsg

Wa sibeh Unpopular opinion: its like an iPad w 4 wheels DONT FLAME ME,btohqsg

So for now I drive a Lexus,btohqsg
Tesla is just a normal car with basic AI and electric eng (life size RC car) to me,btohqsg
Because soon or later Gov stopping all gas cars on the road liao🤦‍♂️,btohqsg
I think electric cars are not very perfect at present  and it takes a long time to charge. However  Tesla's sales volume is really very strong. I don't know why,btohqsg
Not really before we had buggy is the same,btohqsg
Actually right now electric or gas cars is the same lor haha,btohqsg

how to use auto hold for cars?,btohqsg
let go the brake will auto hold there issit,btohqsg
i see some cars have i suagu,btohqsg
What in the new car is that,btohqsg
When you brake your car to a stop  Auto Hold keeps the braking pressure you last applied. You can take your foot off the brake pedal and all four wheel brakes will stay on.,btohqsg
i see golf and some newer cars have,btohqsg
press on the brake hard and release,btohqsg
mercs i know have  it just depressed on the brake harder,btohqsg
don't think is new. 10 years ago have this function already,btohqsg
From my experience dunnid to press hard. Jus need to press down the pedal more,btohqsg
but now getting more n more,btohqsg
now my gear stick also disappearing,btohqsg
I don't dare to use sia. Dunno when the technology will fail. Handbrake is the best,btohqsg
Auto Hold and the Parking Brake button different leh,btohqsg
Oh shit no handbrake means cant drift,btohqsg
Haha it’s okay  I’m quite free  can arrange some other days,btohqsg
I went to meet your friend again to discuss on the kit,btohqsg
Hmm I'm not sure about the specifics of this. But I know I don't have autohold  so I use the handbrake at traffic lights,btohqsg
