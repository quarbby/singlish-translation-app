Hi   this is a social studies SRQb question  can I ask what are global solutions for cyber security threats ? I can’t seem to find anyone global ones for security   only for transnational terrorism,btohqsg
say yes individual have a more important role to play than global solution,btohqsg
Cause every problem starts from individual ?,btohqsg
I can say balanced can I,btohqsg
if u dont click on sus link,btohqsg
Just dont go to shady sites,btohqsg
But how the sus link get to individuals,btohqsg
You can have a solution only if you know what the problem is.One individual can make their own network secure by .....they can also not click on spam emails cause some might be able to disclose their emails or passwords to any third party.NEVER save your pws to websites  especially if you love to buy things online cause bank cake details still can be leak while doing transactions.,btohqsg
Ik internet security is one global solution,btohqsg
global can always be like having good  anti virus application to prevent having malwares,btohqsg
But technically individual efforts oni protect against noob level cyber threata,btohqsg
That’s why I think both is important,btohqsg
but I am more towards individual kek,btohqsg
It’s just the conclusion that’s diff,btohqsg
Wait ss srq need how many para?,btohqsg
1 for each side 1 con,btohqsg
tats how u get 8 hehe,btohqsg
but it might be abit weak,btohqsg

I found a research report done on intentional responses to cybersecurity.,btohqsg
Not too sure if it will be helpful to you,btohqsg
Maybe I dm you that report and you can skim through it ?,btohqsg
It is 34 pages and quite wordly,btohqsg
u can throw neko into longkang,btohqsg
then u will be regarded as neko hero,btohqsg
Cloud providers and ISPs that provide ddos protection  block known bot nets.Anti virus software that have a database storing virus definitions/tech that can detect virus based on certain traits.Companies that audit open src software for vulnerabilities.,btohqsg

I saw 1 australia uni med degree 500k,btohqsg
Maybe lecturer etc or teacher or pharmacist,btohqsg
That's 3 different kind of role,btohqsg
But i see a lot of them have at least a masters,btohqsg
Either 1 of the 3 ah,btohqsg
Lecturer don't need if you meant poly lecturer,btohqsg
But your industrial background must be strong,btohqsg
normally I see must be at least 5 years of industry experience,btohqsg
My gpa now only 3.5 cause hbl pill down,btohqsg
u still have chance for local uni...,btohqsg
I see. I had a lecturer who got 30 years experience,btohqsg
3.5 still can go bio in ntu?,btohqsg
u which year in poly now?,btohqsg
I was so upset after thr open book tedt.,btohqsg
This year covid I think 3.8 also maybe cannot,btohqsg
yesyes <3 u lahh no sed,btohqsg
But if overseas uni becomes popular again  people will start to go overseas,btohqsg
u have 3 more sems right,btohqsg
But i also got build portfolio ah,btohqsg
then you might have chance with ABA,btohqsg
HAHA but this sem die also i guess,btohqsg
Cause open bk mess up my 1 3cu module,btohqsg
But most other modules All A/B+,btohqsg
aim for 4.0 for remaining sems,btohqsg
Like i join subcommittee  cca i joined planning comm  i took up class rep and main IC for sch fund raising,btohqsg

I will try but thank u guys i appreciate it.,btohqsg
Please feel free to support my cover in the future if possible thank u!,btohqsg
The advantage of diploma is you at least have corporate world to fall back on,btohqsg
which poly course r u in anyway,btohqsg

Drop ur link!!  I go see,btohqsg
I got so many friends in thr,btohqsg
I got some even finish nus pharm,btohqsg
they complain they earn lesser than mi,btohqsg
HAHA pharmacy i think u cant earn much lah,btohqsg
My colleague during my temp job also entered NUS pharm from pharm sci I think,btohqsg
the pay is rly damn little imo,btohqsg
Science honestly doesn't really pay well considering the hours,btohqsg
HAHA and the amt of brain dmg,btohqsg
I earn less than 3k lmao  but my work hours 8h+,btohqsg
Good thing is I don't really need to bring back work  and I see peopel don't bring back laptop also,btohqsg
Nah I tried coding already not my style,btohqsg
Oh urs is local uni degree?,btohqsg
Is Melbourne Uni Or Queensland btr? Or are both considered good?,btohqsg
Yea it's really a matter of passion or,btohqsg
u work in a different field,btohqsg
quite some ppl from chem work in oil,btohqsg
Don't put too much hope on it,btohqsg
Tmw the main source of energy changes to renewable,btohqsg
Sec sch teachers earn more than pharmacist?,btohqsg
I think sec school teacher earns $8k,btohqsg
Yeah i think so. Heard abt it but unsure so,btohqsg
But such gov jobs  you got the stability lah,btohqsg
But i think their pay quite good already..,btohqsg
Pay good to tackle with problematic students and parents,btohqsg
But okay lah they got holidays also,btohqsg
School holiday is not really school holiday,btohqsg
Nah I think fresh entree leh,btohqsg
I think maybe starting pay is like 3.8k,btohqsg
HOD might be up to 10k per month,btohqsg
I mean sec sch content quite easy to teach,btohqsg
It's easy for us but for the students it's not,btohqsg
If i were to teach  i would teach biology.,btohqsg
u nid sport management cert anywasy,btohqsg
that time i intern in sec sch then saw my jc chem cher there,btohqsg
then he talked abt the salaries,btohqsg
I see quite a lot of have at least a PhD or Masters..,btohqsg
One of my lecturers directly do MSc so no industrial background,btohqsg
they hired her on condition she clear internship with GSK,btohqsg
GSk ppl earn a lot right,btohqsg
i think higher than industry average,btohqsg
Weird thing is she's the main in-charge for internship relations,btohqsg
They even have pay grade depending on honours,btohqsg
Gov confirm earn higher one if you have high GPA,btohqsg
Micron is another one that has that kind of pay grade,btohqsg
But GSK Micron all those if you enter without degree I think they will hiam,btohqsg
i study science degree not for research,btohqsg
i plan to work as somethin else aft grad,btohqsg
I study for the industry only,btohqsg
PhD is more of like for research purposes?,btohqsg
But ends up I still need to do research—,btohqsg
Yea it's hyperspecialising into research for PhD,btohqsg
If you got business mindset then you can be regional manager or some manager manager thing,btohqsg
idk if i shld do FYI or FYP tbh,btohqsg
For me i just wanna finish it cause of interest,btohqsg
Which one do u like more,btohqsg
It depends on what you want to do on grad lor,btohqsg
If you want industry then professional internship,btohqsg
If you want do research as labrat then FYP,btohqsg
But then if you want do research you cannot stop at BSc,btohqsg
your pay will stagnant until you get your PhD,btohqsg
Oh yeah are awards impt for portfolio like sch awards etc,btohqsg
RA role is always transient role,btohqsg
I rmb one of my teachers finish BSc only but got a lot of experience.,btohqsg
For poly lecturers that's usually the case,btohqsg
Some will choose to do PhD but there are some who choose not to even tho they can,btohqsg
Yeah i see alot got experience,btohqsg
They see case by case basis?,btohqsg
It depends on what they want to do with the PhD lor,btohqsg
or if it's based on interest,btohqsg
anyways i applied for some ttsh sponsorship and i got called for an interview but they havent got back to me about the outcome of the application and its been a month.,btohqsg
Does this mean that i am most likely not accepted,btohqsg
if i do FYI chances of going into research jobs after grad is lower/harder?,btohqsg
I think you can email and ask,btohqsg
Yeah i am planning to write in tmr!,btohqsg
A month is very long but then government like to take their own sweet time  or benefit of doubt  they are just following good hiring practices lmao,btohqsg
If i am accepted then i have to serve a bond of 2.5years after ns,btohqsg
Hmmm this one idk leh  if is NTU/NUS that kind then ya harder coz you need reference,btohqsg
got ppl with med condition (eg. color blindness) still do FYP?,btohqsg
Oh okay sorry! If i did.,btohqsg
In the first place severe colourblind  the pre matric checkup will pick up already  and you might lose placement,btohqsg
If still can enter I think is ok  just don't do anything that need you to see colour too much bah,btohqsg
Honestly if it's instrumentation  most likely you don't need do colour differentiation  that's what the machine is for,btohqsg
Eh u gg for phd ?,btohqsg
oh whats diff btwn masters and phD btw,btohqsg
It's when salutation will change to Dr,btohqsg
Whats the requirements for a PhD?,btohqsg
If NTU  2nd upper honours for direct PhD  meaning you skip MSc,btohqsg
But the higher you go  the more specialised your role becomes,btohqsg
So you need to be sure why you want to do anything that's higher than a Bachelors,btohqsg
I heard PhD assessments is like presentation or research papers or the likes,btohqsg
Like for clinical psych  you definitely need masters  but for science or chem at least  you don't need unless you wanna focus on something,btohqsg
You do research projects  and publish paper in order to clear PhD,btohqsg
Being overqualified is a problem that exists,btohqsg
Yea but being self-employed is easier said than done,btohqsg
What kind of niche can you bring to the market?,btohqsg
If don't have  you're gonna be in for a nightmare,btohqsg
And being self-employed doesn't require a PhD,btohqsg
i can be a failure in the market,btohqsg
You start earlier  you actually get to see results earlier,btohqsg
Seems like someone forgot the internal standard so I just run it again over the weekend,btohqsg
If confirm forget then I can reprepare next week  fastgaem,btohqsg
First time chem side I last to zao,btohqsg
hi are via hours available for mentors?,btohqsg
