"bro really said ""lousier"" and thought he cooked",btohqsg
Agree. Once 2 happens   1 will eventually lose out too,btohqsg
it's not that  this guy really cannot hide his elitist mindset,btohqsg
You bought them at 2020? Or when this AI hype happened,btohqsg
some of his other comments are damn stupid aswell,btohqsg
what if all of these is rae alt acc,btohqsg
this guy is not just elitist but a pedo,btohqsg
"rae is the type of person to ask why yijc people could have just gone to poly since ""sp uni rates are higher than yi""",btohqsg
stop throwing around the word pedo,btohqsg
he's just weird not a child predator,btohqsg

"""I disagree. One should not have to compromise on their beliefs just to fit into society. Why should he tolerate all the pro-lgbt preaching by those people when he can just shut them off?Also there‚Äôs nothing wrong with him being uncomfortable with lgbt people  since it‚Äôs his religious beliefs. Are we supposed to throw those down the drain just to fit into society? I think you may have to think carefully tooTalking about racism  liberals are in fact the MOST racist  not the least racist. Look at US and yk alr. They look like the least racist cause they ‚Äútolerate gays‚Äù or something  but they are the actual racistsBut yes  he should not talk about this lgbt thing  because sadly in this ‚Äútolerant‚Äùworld that is actually intolerant  if you say something against lgbt people you gonna get beaten to death. For op own safety I would reco he just not say anything about this  no choice.""",btohqsg
nop but i took chinese lit in y3y4,btohqsg
"""liberals are the most racist"" instant downvote",btohqsg
as much as far left liberals may be crazyno one is gonna beat you to death for being homophobic?? If you are homophobic at most you get called names online.  its more of the other way round where being gay can literally get you killed,btohqsg
how tf does racism lead to lgbtq???,btohqsg
how are there so many wrong points in one statement...,btohqsg
this guy is the type of person who thinks that a racist person is gay,btohqsg
there is a difference between being forced to throw away a belief and literally accepting the existence of people with a different lifestyle choice,btohqsg
"""they look like the least racist cos they tolerate gays or something"" WHAT ARE YOU SAYING???",btohqsg
bruh if udl gay ppl just,btohqsg
im gonna go stlk this dudes profile,btohqsg
no it's not even that  bro doesn't even know the definition of racism,btohqsg
racism is not interconnected to homophobia,btohqsg
in fact acs ppl are proving it wrong  you can either be racist or homophobic  not both,btohqsg
"you're not gonna like it. bro has a major inferiority complex and talks about how asr is ""mid low tier"" and how he messed up psle and O lvls (which is def gonna piss josh off",btohqsg

actually lcw should be the projector since this mf keeps on saying he could have gone into sajc,btohqsg
I FOUND THE ANTI GAY COMMENT,btohqsg
yea i think that even if you personally think being lgbt is against your own morals as long as you just leave other ppl alone and dont hate on them it should be ok,btohqsg
yea  I believe that they have their own rights to live,btohqsg
i think he would die in SA ngl,btohqsg
Your life is your life my life is mine,btohqsg
real like just let ppl do what they want,btohqsg
"first thing he would say to the ogls is ""does anyone want to stop ovulating?""",btohqsg

Even in Uni it's more of when lol especially if hall resident,btohqsg
Even if so Uni provides downtime and that awkward amount of time ie between lessons if u finished a 12pm lesson but got class at 5pm,btohqsg
U ain't gonna schedule a date for that Amt of time just go back hall to study.... well for as long as until someone knocks on your door,btohqsg
Uni provides far too many unavoidable opportunities even if u introverted af,btohqsg
Should do it imo for at least 1 sem or better 1 year,btohqsg
Even NUS if u get decent grades and decent portfolio can probably get RC/hall for Freshies,btohqsg
Every interaction I had with Profs are legit easy going one.,btohqsg
Your friend didn't do homework on the Prof?,btohqsg
That's the first thing most ppl do lol,btohqsg
Doesn't matter... u should have done your research as to what the Profs work is,btohqsg
If it's anything non STEM related u can probably get a journal article and read their stance on issues through parsing out words,btohqsg
The Prof is Humanties and social sciences rite?,btohqsg
at least better for him right,btohqsg
Gg why give me clown emoji,btohqsg

You love the sun or rain,btohqsg

theres one way to find out,btohqsg
inland places can reach 40¬∞C in summer,btohqsg
i dont know why im so tired,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just the ocean bodies having a much higher heat capacity (plus they flow so the heat is dispersed more evenly) so cities near them don‚Äôt experience as great of temperature fluctuations,btohqsg
That's what I'm saying ü§£ humidity bout kill us,btohqsg
tbh i forgot about it in terms of geog,btohqsg
i just know the physics of it,btohqsg
guys i last ate at 10am,btohqsg

isit ur blood sugar level low?,btohqsg
idk i feel like vomiting and falling asleep,btohqsg
idk i think i should eat at 3pm ltr but then idk cause i dont really have the appetite,btohqsg
That's why one should always keep biscuits on their pack,btohqsg
Doesn't spoil for 2 years even if crushed to dust can still eat and in a pinch it will work to satisfy the primordial instinctual hunger,btohqsg
I smurf all the NS knowledge whenever a friend group discusses that,btohqsg
Bruh tbvh crushed is even better usually can mix with water a make a paste to chow down without the thirst,btohqsg
How‚Äôs the pw stats this year,btohqsg

Prev stat I heard is 60 smth,btohqsg
is it better or worse than usual,btohqsg
but i still feel the same,btohqsg
pw is the only subject in the history of mi that they will show distinction rate,btohqsg
because the rate for other subjects is too low alr,btohqsg
This gave me a death scare,btohqsg
guys should i go outside of sch or go canteen,btohqsg
yea and my break until 420,btohqsg
I thought you said ur school food is not bad,btohqsg
i took a short break from group chats,btohqsg
after the whole fake lawyer shit,btohqsg
yea but now most of the canteen stalls are closed alr,btohqsg
this why i Neva went to jc,btohqsg
at least we have better teachers,btohqsg
now is the h1 content subject period (i take 4h2) then 420 is chem,btohqsg
i end late cause i take a ü§° combi,btohqsg
no one in poly will care if you suddenly stop going to school,btohqsg
i mean tbh yea i think i should go out of sch too,btohqsg
i mean it's your education if U dw go then it's on u ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
for some reason i dont have the energy and i only have 40min on ypt today,btohqsg
a part of me is saying to skip eating to do work now but my stomach legit hurts alr,btohqsg
and i think maybe some fresh air would do me good,btohqsg
bro what do U think U should dp,btohqsg
Yea  after all you are the one paying 3k,btohqsg
Pri and second school are heavily subsidized by govt  poly is not  so they don't care. It's not their money,btohqsg
@pobbyywhat food should i buy at gas station,btohqsg
should i buy like a puff or a full meal,btohqsg
you should buy a full meal,btohqsg
my break ends at 420 so should be fine,btohqsg
You think the govt will happily pay momey on your behalf to skip school ah,btohqsg
There's no conversation it's common sense,btohqsg
ok but it rlly is up to the teacher on whether they want to care about the student or not,btohqsg
and in jcs you will still have form teachers,btohqsg
Compare with oversea and international school,btohqsg
pob i told you about the boy right,btohqsg
No lah they say poly no tuition cheaper than sec and pri,btohqsg
As long not oversea or international school is cheap,btohqsg
3k a sem compared to secondary school 60 a month,btohqsg
tuition easier add up more than 3k bro,btohqsg
nowadays kids get A also tuition lol,btohqsg
Who tf goes for more than 4 tuition in sec school,btohqsg
like all my friends?common in elite schools,btohqsg
Oh sorry  theres no such comparison for poly tho..all poly average 3k 6 sems,btohqsg
even sap mid tier secondary school,btohqsg
at most no tuition for humanities,btohqsg
i used to have 2 english n 2 chinese lol,btohqsg
but chinese english math science all tuition,btohqsg
yeah somemore english got essay tuition,btohqsg
2 English and 2 Chinese? You mean 4 diff teachers? Or 4 session a month,btohqsg
Yea my parents also kiasu to not fail,btohqsg
Maybe cause of my surroundings  never heard of ppl have 4 tuitions,btohqsg
humanities maybe they hire undergrad ah but math science cfm learning lab or elite tuition centre,btohqsg
i think mid tier school and above got alr,btohqsg
Should i buy a big or small drink,btohqsg
should i buy a big or small milk tea,btohqsg
if big is outside if small is buy in dhs,btohqsg
The market smaller but humanities if u find your niche can probably earn decently for tution,btohqsg
Idk ah my one prob not mid tier but ok,btohqsg
lol my friend spend alot on geog cafe tuition genius,btohqsg
the geog cafe buy charge like 200+/hfor one to one,btohqsg
someone need to give a tie,btohqsg
got parents willing to pay 200+/h,btohqsg
cos he usually do class only,btohqsg
Yeah exactly smaller market but still can earn a fuck ton cuz those that suck legit suck,btohqsg
so many y1 y2walking out now,btohqsg
I mean it's up to where you wanna go lorh,btohqsg
no lah pri and sec is parents force mah,btohqsg
I chose tuition in pri sch üíÄ,btohqsg
Valerie should i buy a big or small milk tea,btohqsg
econs is not niche .only geog hist ss etc,btohqsg
Jc payable is equivalent to sec school,btohqsg
econs tuition is like math alot of parents whack,btohqsg
Idk you are imbue with your own free will,btohqsg
told u count the tuition price alr bro haha show the school fee no use.,btohqsg
Force? No it's based on the student. Case in point  my bro scored below 12 for o levels  I scored 26...same education path way,btohqsg
econs is a subject majority of jc students take,btohqsg
cause most students for both arts and sci would take econs,btohqsg
thats why got ppl charge 300/h lol,btohqsg
ry550 keep saying jc sec cheaper than poly,btohqsg
They wanna get that sweet sweet money,btohqsg
when if u add tuition then jc sec more ex,btohqsg
No what I'm saying is yes dependent on your attitude in studies and your parents..there too much factors to conclusively say sec school cost more over the 4 years than poly,btohqsg
too many tuition teachers here liao isit all looking for new tutees,btohqsg
Singapore's Loh Kean Yew has been knocked out in the first round of the Badminton Asia Championships. He was the first Singaporean to win a silver medal at the tournament last year.https://cna.asia/3TWTVFo,btohqsg
nah i nvr do tuition alr only like when waiting for uni,btohqsg
plus tuition 1 to 1 girl do better,btohqsg
I tutor them I guarantee at least an S,btohqsg
If I cut my penis off do I count as girl?,btohqsg
3k a sem 6k a yr  that is 18k in 3 yrs  for sec school is around 2.5k in 4 yrs. If you somehow manage to accumulate 16k worth of tuition in 4 years  that is 4k yearly solely on tuition. Then you better be in jc,btohqsg
Parents spend 16k extra for you and you go poly to waste another 18k over 4 yrs...that is fucked,btohqsg
more common then u think bro,btohqsg
i know ppl spend 80k in jc also end up poly,btohqsg
I know but it still doesn't take away the fact that it's fucked,btohqsg
got parents spend kllike 40k+ also end up ite/poly,btohqsg
Someone on sgexams mentioned she had 9 tuitions a week for olevels,btohqsg
Can't be common..if it's common tutors gonna get flamed left and right,btohqsg
Yea i think U deserve what your stomach feels üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
i woudl estimate is around 4-6 average,btohqsg
bro end of the day the tutors sit in their maserati they dun care.,btohqsg
My school did not even have 6 tuition able subjects if that's a word,btohqsg
Her family wanted her to go ur JC lmao,btohqsg
Didn't make it but settled for another IP JC,btohqsg
4 main  one poa..that's it  the rest you take are coursework,btohqsg
elite school probably go for more ironically,btohqsg
I bet they have tons of money,btohqsg
Yea but you can't take amaths and poa,btohqsg
They set that rule idk for what,btohqsg
So if you take amaths you have to take coursework,btohqsg
mid tier jc average like 3 rm condo alr,btohqsg
My school is somewhat fucked because during my time they underwent a sas transformstion,btohqsg
Cause another nearby school was closed  students from that school came in,btohqsg
walao my mid tier jc alot is braddell landed serangoon etc.sembawang landed,btohqsg
The prob was  my school has as big of a name as Maha bodhi,btohqsg
But what happen was McPherson sec students were shifted in,btohqsg
but average was 3-4rm condo in newton hillview etc,btohqsg
99% of what? Lmao last I saw the stats was 60-70 that kind,btohqsg
1 mil now can get u shoe box,btohqsg
My sec school used be very notable for top scorers but after the transition  shit hit the fan,btohqsg
Chey then yeah 80% around there,btohqsg
i tot like 50% ppl stay condo and landed lol,btohqsg
In 5 yrs  my school took in 2 other neighborhood school students  so mid-tier mix with low-tier,btohqsg
That was the end game for my school,btohqsg
But singapore is an open economy u don't just look as SC in isolation imo,btohqsg
cos all my freiend from childhood is like same condo nearby condo landed etc,btohqsg
Yeah I get your point I just making my point too,btohqsg
nvr rly talk to hdb ppl,btohqsg
There's many abandoned hdbs and unsold landed properties,btohqsg
cos the condo area didnt hagve any hdb nearby,btohqsg
Like concurrently as we speak there are around 30 hdbs in sg that are completely empty...each holds about 200 units,btohqsg
i want make hdb friend also cannot,btohqsg
They are part of a backlog for enbloc,btohqsg
If u did community service or like external event probably can what,btohqsg
You can't even definitively know who is from a hdb,btohqsg
I had friends which I thought stayed in a hdb but was in a condo or landed  their parents drive run down cars and they lived like they were from a hdb,btohqsg
Ah then gotta wait till uni lor even then also won't see the true bottom,btohqsg
I find most hdb kids keep to their own hdb clique,btohqsg
the analysts at temasek more qualififed then them ah,btohqsg
I was queuing for atm once the old aunty in front of me forgot her receipt and it showed 1.2 mil in her deposit savings account for POSB,btohqsg
Unless their family tree got someone live in condo  they likely won't venture out to make friends with people who don't live in hdb or at least tougher to,btohqsg
maybe they shld go for one cpaital markets internship,btohqsg
Idk ah maybe it's my hdb estate but that is what I find,btohqsg

Cuz government has to provide and prop that up,btohqsg
If u kena solvency issue I can liquidate at 97 cents on the dollar vs like 80+ cents in T+2,btohqsg

jpm morgan stanley citi boa db ubs,btohqsg
But ain't the spending habits within hdb itself quite broad?,btohqsg
DB the easiest one to get,btohqsg
Like I know neighbours that don't have air-conditioning in their units,btohqsg
oh u go those for pb or global amrkerts,btohqsg
Got someone in my poly join 18 cca  no commitment for 9 of them,btohqsg
recommended to have diverse skillset.if u all consulting resume look abit sian,btohqsg
In the end  the portfolio also put the 9 without commitment,btohqsg
case comp lowkey rigged one tho,btohqsg
just do 1-3 consulting 1-2 banking(cap market),btohqsg
quant if u not math olympiad can give up alr unless u rly like,btohqsg
Yea make sense cause income ceiling threshold to get a bto is just a few k more,btohqsg
quant need nus cs or ntu re though,btohqsg
How do you think people can own 100k cars owning a hdb otherwise,btohqsg
The average hdb dweller must earn quite Alot,btohqsg
but heard alot is 4.9+ nus cs get,btohqsg
No there are sports as well  got one very famous one is called archery,btohqsg
They literally just join and that's it,btohqsg
heard some people in nus cs can actually memorise the leetcode answers zzzz..,btohqsg
like memorise a ton of it,btohqsg
Knn I say hdb ppl not earning much  then this kuro say hdb ppl earning 10k at least...you tell me I lying?,btohqsg
actl 10k can buy shitty condo,btohqsg
So the average hdb household earns 10k...that is literally what it says. What did I say was wrong? HDB income ceiling is like 14k,btohqsg
pob im so proud of u,btohqsg
only BB and quant got pay that ah,btohqsg
isnt this fresh grad pay alr,btohqsg
how isist average when they promote,btohqsg
So you are saying that the HDB income ceiling for bto of 14K makes it affordable for the average family or no?,btohqsg
Because I'm out here trying to figure out how ppl keep on saying it's not affordable but then they own 100k cars,btohqsg
theres a reason why alot of fresh grads bto 5 room,btohqsg
or 4 room in central location,btohqsg
parent help them with bto  downpay then 5rm/4rm central,btohqsg
Are they actually clowning or if they did not have the car  then they would not have a reason to complain,btohqsg
mid tier consulting / trading house got offer me 5k+ alr ah,btohqsg
cant imagine jc until 5 or 6,btohqsg
MM S&T and bp got 3k for intern. so full time cfm 5k+ min,btohqsg
You do know in the past  when people spoke and objected on things  the govt actually listened. That's why the govt nowadays have started closing void decks,btohqsg
yeah i guess u have to plan since y1,btohqsg
if  not u miss timing gg,btohqsg
i didnt go exchange to spam intenrship,btohqsg
But like it can be said it's residence problem that they got annoyed by youngsters at the void decks.Still the govt listened and have started closing the spaces for use to kids,btohqsg
but 5k i feel its okay but i want grad prog and masters so just decline lor lol,btohqsg
but not enough for good lifestyle,btohqsg
5k is just surviving normally with bto,btohqsg
Nvm I'm just deal with whatever money I can manage to earn monthly next time and adjust accordingly to my expenses,btohqsg
gp is guranteed 10k+ after bond?,btohqsg
I mean I don't even have a high spending lifestyle  like I spend $6-$10 max on food for all 3 meals maybe 100-200 a month on hobby $100+ on utilities and that's it. The rest can become savings or investments,btohqsg
