Hi anyone participated in the Webull 8.4% May promo? Is it worth exchanging sgd to usd to enjoy the promo?,btohqsg
Correct. Most if not all card users in sg aren't in this  or any other financial related groups. They won't notice what card they are tapping on for and those are the people subsiding rewards for the rest of us,btohqsg
I think this also valid reason,btohqsg
No  actually i was referring to 2018 promo.,btohqsg
Bro can share more on 2018. Not similar to the pict I share,btohqsg
My human that withdrew on 1st June. Not taking part. I don‚Äôt want any uncertainty or argument on the 30 day thing.I have another human $1k since 2nd May. Using that human for July cycle if still decent.,btohqsg
Can any gurus here give any insights on this? Thanks so much !,btohqsg

"Here's my ""realistic"" calculation:30 (mobile and contactless) / 800 (minimum) = 0.0375Ignore overseas (better cards around for that) and others (that scummy 0.3% again)",btohqsg
Bros and sisters. What is your opinion on using amex card rather than a 4 miles rewards cards.,btohqsg
For miles? No point. Amex good for hooting the sign up bonus and then cancelling the next year. The earn rate so low some more.,btohqsg
Yes agree with you... but cancel already amex scan QR can't be use in hawker already?,btohqsg
Factor in the FX spread for conversion  see if the return% is up to your liking. 7% p.a. is still rather attractive. But note of the FX fluctuation risk,btohqsg
If that's your intention then sure lah  especially now XNAP is dead,btohqsg
I love how they say its (ENHANCED) but they know they will give less money back to the customer,btohqsg
Agree with the bro. Low point amex.. but I keep it for eat with family at hawker.,btohqsg
Amex they have their own strategy... despite not many people use their cards.. in spore. I rather surprise they can survive so long ... vs local banks or citi   hsbc,btohqsg
I used it ~ 8 times at Klook to save $240  and and 4x at Croissant shop to save about 30%.,btohqsg
Popo so stonk! What about steamboat?,btohqsg
Amex has brand name/ prestige going in its favour. The truly rich dont care how much % they are getting back from their spending,btohqsg
I think most in amex chat treats it like a game? lol.,btohqsg
What is your definitely of truly rich?I heard there are even those who don‚Äôt even pay with their own hands.,btohqsg
Yeah they are different kind of optimisers I feel. Maximising vouchers instead of air miles earned,btohqsg
"when my friend asked  ""dont everyone has an RM?  and oh  it's just Citigold...""",btohqsg
RIP EVOL  was the last standing amongst the trio of contactless cashback cards (Frank  Live Fresh  EVOL),btohqsg
HSBCSG (1/2): You've qualified for the HSBC Everyday+ Rewards Programme! From now until 31JUL2024  enjoy 1% Cashback on eligible debit card spends andFinally received!,btohqsg
Truly rich don‚Äôt even use cards‚Ä¶,btohqsg
$800 what's the zzzzzx  so what's next,btohqsg
Hmm ü§î 800 so means 400 contact less & 400 online? Nedd Chris to revise,btohqsg
Nah  the pooled and lower cashback cap is the killer,btohqsg
I dont park money with ocbc 360,btohqsg
Doesn't matter anymore since going forward online and mobilepay shares the same cashback cap of $30,btohqsg
WOW is combine Total $30 not $40 as before,btohqsg
Zzzz what the xx guessed Evol down the drains again like HSBC Revo,btohqsg
Hmm ü§î what's next to replace Sian 2 more month to enjoying the last Evol,btohqsg
Even worse than that lol. Online and contactless are now combined into one category capped at $30,btohqsg
The other two cashback categories are trash  plainly put,btohqsg
Killing it plus min 800 spend,btohqsg
I can still see a use case if they removed foreign transaction fees for this card  but otherwise it just doesn't make sense,btohqsg
Ya still can use for overseas loh if get 50 for 800 spend is 6.25 cashback,btohqsg
Incorrect if foreign transaction fees are still in place  which will eat into the overall % back. Hence why I mentioned they should waive said fees to make this card somewhat more marketable,btohqsg
u still get net gain lah  just need to keep the fcy spending at 200 sgd max,btohqsg
It means the nerfenhancedthe bank profit.,btohqsg
I will still bring it when i go traveling haha  but must physically insert into the terminal  or wave the card but must not use mobile contactless loh,btohqsg
Hi folks can I check. Is it hsbc revo card cannot use with Kris pay or fave ShopBack?,btohqsg
The nerf was very similar to ocbc frank to be honest  except that ocbc frank allow the foreign currency spend to be online which is easier,btohqsg
Some traditional methods still applied ..,btohqsg
Can use  but make sure the MCC still falls within the whitelist.,btohqsg
I use hsbc revolution link to Google.  It links to kris pay for my shop and eat,btohqsg
Maybe switch to ocbc card to earn More ocbc 360 int while use uob one to earn bonus int after nerf Evol,btohqsg
