i saw the news that time 24 degress in texas ppl get heat stroke,btohqsg
But I go Japan  the amount of slopes and stairs I think they the ones build different,btohqsg
Walk 2km to train station to them is near,btohqsg
Is she really? I dont see ur commitment,btohqsg
I was just talking about itasha but i sense u went a different path,btohqsg
It's not as cringe as the things I've done for asuka HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
But u still going to itasha her right,btohqsg
Unless he wanna go Rei and i go asuka,btohqsg
Gonna get judged by clients so badly sia,btohqsg
Y do u care abt this,btohqsg
they put food on my table and mods into my car,btohqsg
Not rly. As long as the job is done right. Ur not the sales what,btohqsg
Well as long as u dont go lewd on the design. Technically its not any different than taxi advertising,btohqsg
I mean... That's not how boomer clients will look at it la,btohqsg
If this is the concern then asuka works better,btohqsg
You think here japan meh  where everyone watches anime,btohqsg
Youll be surprised how many people watch,btohqsg
i see boomer play pokemon go,btohqsg
I think that one can pass,btohqsg
I mean... You can ask how many ppl here knows what's eva,btohqsg
you got a good sample size,btohqsg
Lycoris recoil or lucky stat this kind  not many. But mainstream stuff like bleach  one p  demon slayer  gundam  i will say half the civilized population knows or at least aware,btohqsg
You show me one piece or bleach characters now i probably also dk who is who,btohqsg
They may not know the name but theyll know its from what anime,btohqsg
Like girl biting the bamboo oh is demon slayer one,btohqsg
i have no idea what yall talking abt,btohqsg
I think you show derek and me fairytail characters i also tell you from one piece,btohqsg
fairytail... i think i know also,btohqsg
u dunno dun come confuse me wei,btohqsg
Natsu fairytail the fire dragon guy,btohqsg
In the news: 30 yo miata driver tells 40 yo itasha owner that he scared being judged by boomer if he itasha his miata,btohqsg
why fire then derek say lightning LOL,btohqsg
1 anime gt many characters lah dei,btohqsg
Cos i hang anime stuff on my mirror i alr kena judged,btohqsg
So idk how will the mainstream people judge me if i itasha,btohqsg
Now season 3 go watch watch,btohqsg
idk if that's a compliment or not,btohqsg
Upper rank come attack alrdy opsss,btohqsg
Im questioning your identity as anime lover,btohqsg
But from what i see u just stifling your enjoyment because of outsiders,btohqsg
Remember ur money is for your enjoyment,btohqsg
They make u guard their house  they have to see your itasha,btohqsg
Yes... You see my very beautiful rims  her dad did the touch up,btohqsg
There are many other ways to enjoy things,btohqsg
But some ways are more enjoyable than others,btohqsg
Bro we already know u wanna do it,btohqsg
That night u show me the taobao,btohqsg
But then if you get judged  it wont be enjoyable already,btohqsg
It's funny because this question i always ask myself but i cannot answer myself,btohqsg
"""why do we care about the opinions of people we barely know?""",btohqsg
Well  u have to care less,btohqsg
it's not as easy as you say man,btohqsg
Its more important not being an asshole than what u stick on a car,btohqsg
I mean in your case its work,btohqsg
You dont pull up for an interview in an itasha and expects people to treat you seriously,btohqsg
Just make sure ur design is tasteful then,btohqsg
I think how u carry yourself for the first few sentences is more important,btohqsg
That's what i thought also la,btohqsg
But in this society it's not that easy,btohqsg
We're taught not to judge people by the cover,btohqsg
as much as i try to deny,btohqsg
2 ways to read this: this guy cant be taken seriously because he puts his favorite anime on his car. OrThis guy has confidence off the charts to put his favorite anime on his car,btohqsg
"Most people they see is ""this guy watch anime ah  cfm is some small kid that can't be taken seriously""",btohqsg
it's what people have told me,btohqsg
They even tell me the way i dress looks like an intern,btohqsg
U know what boomers (people even older than me with kids in sec sch) tell me?,btohqsg
"""dont judge a book by it's cover"" LOL",btohqsg
‚ÄúEh thats the netflix anime! Thats your favorite character ah?‚Äù,btohqsg
It depends on the people you meet also la,btohqsg
Rich ass millionaires you think they think that way meh,btohqsg
or issit those HDB play pokemon go people,btohqsg
It can also be your answer,btohqsg
The rich people are more judgemental than other people,btohqsg
Its up to you how u want to carry it,btohqsg
You just need to get more exposed to them la,btohqsg
I buy that because u front office there is some difference,btohqsg
It doesn't even matter if my car has an anime girl on it or not,btohqsg
But i dont buy that it will affect your sales unless u do something lewd or distasteful,btohqsg
if i drive up in a base model euro cars,btohqsg
Well then. It doesnt fucking matter any more then does it,btohqsg
it's a matter of how seriously they wanna treat you,btohqsg
Perhaps one thing they will recognize is that the artwork is not cheap,btohqsg
anything you say will just fly over their head,btohqsg
you can speak like a lawyer,btohqsg
just cos you dont look the part,btohqsg
You can look like a lawyer but speaks like an ahbeng,btohqsg
they also will take you seriously,btohqsg
"they think ""wah this guy cfm alot of experience on the streets""",btohqsg
We can talk round the moon bro  if u dont wanna do it u will have reasons not to,btohqsg
If u wanna do it u can,btohqsg
honestly this is probably the best solution,btohqsg
A Koenigsseg Agera to be taken seriously in and then your Miata Itasha,btohqsg
I really thinking what happens if i pull up in a Ferrari itasha,btohqsg
Probably still respect but some questions before business,btohqsg
They will also ask if ferrari sent u any letters,btohqsg
Sometimes i really think if i'm working for somebody in an office  i'd probably have an itasha by now,btohqsg
But it's very hard if i'm the face of the company.,btohqsg
Actually i drive miata already kena judged already,btohqsg
U reach a point where people first impression of u is ‚Äúthis guy doesnt care what i think of him‚Äù,btohqsg
Its a kind of respect also bro,btohqsg
then they will also think  if he doesn't care of what i think about him  will he even care about the project on hand?,btohqsg
I can say they will think ‚Äúhe got money to do this  means should be doing ok‚Äù,btohqsg
I don't care about the project you have on hand,btohqsg
"Cos i have heard both before ""This guy got money means he's capable""",btohqsg
Or they may think ‚Äúhis skin very thick  he will have no problem pissing off my neighbors to get my project done‚Äù,btohqsg
"and i also heard ""this guy got money  means his profitting a lot of money off me  I must cut his price further""",btohqsg
you piss neighbours off your project can delay already,btohqsg
If u Tuas checkpoint kena have discount üòÑ HAHAHHAH,btohqsg
@vincegt86you go there still got free drinks in the fridge,btohqsg
I thought u kena complain by ur customer cos u dont dare illegal park,btohqsg
If you illegal park lagi jialat,btohqsg
But yes i park right infront of their houses one,btohqsg
Coz I think is funny HAHAHAAHGAGA,btohqsg
And depends on how nice they are  my response is either okay i move  or no you want you call LTA come down,btohqsg
But yeah sometimes you annoy them too much  they just keep calling authorities on you,btohqsg
Just itasha your car  put some brands and numbers  if they ask u say u are part time race car driver,btohqsg
My sponsor ask me put one,btohqsg
They will call MOM for unsafe work practices  call NEA for mosquitoes  call LTA  call PUB  smlj also call,btohqsg
then they come one time you stop work 1 time ask you what's going on one time,btohqsg
ask you make report 1 time,btohqsg
they think they pay tax alot..,btohqsg
They are all high and mighty with ego issues one la,btohqsg
and if you dont look or act like them you're lower class citizens alr,btohqsg
dont forget the very same neighbours are the same type of people your clients are,btohqsg
ur M is wrong alr bro,btohqsg
How u going to continue in this family business when u hate the target clientele so much,btohqsg
cannot beat them join them. see roi in 10 years time,btohqsg
merc also no use unless you show up with S class,btohqsg
and also cannot be COE ones,btohqsg
COE ones they think you acting rich nia,btohqsg
5 years he come to car meet in SVJ let u see,btohqsg
Hahahah you all think too much,btohqsg
Bro the way i see it. There is little reason not to itasha. Because u are already pond scum in their eyes,btohqsg
Got supra i can laugh alr,btohqsg
At least then u become pond scum with an interesting car,btohqsg
otakus are probably scums of the earth in their eyes.,btohqsg
The way u put it  im not sure a clean coe miata is any less than a itasha coe miata,btohqsg
If their kids watch anime  it dishonours the family LOL,btohqsg
Its just different flavors of scum,btohqsg
they will think you're a classic car lover,btohqsg
U think these people consider ur nc a classic,btohqsg
Ur car doesnt look old old,btohqsg
Actually some asks me if it's parf before,btohqsg
Exactly it is nowhere near classic,btohqsg
they know the miata name is classic,btohqsg
Some people cos ask me if i did pop ups delete,btohqsg
some people thinks mine is an NB,btohqsg
my miat is a conversation starter actually,btohqsg
this is a thing? lol who does that,btohqsg
you see so many RX7 in sg no pop ups,btohqsg
they like the cleaner look i guess,btohqsg
"But i also got the usual ""why nv buy SLK or Z4""",btohqsg
then my answer is always cos not manual,btohqsg
Yea those are totally the same price,btohqsg
u ask them why nv buy a bigger hse lo,btohqsg
say eh ur neighbour hse like nicer ah,btohqsg
"""come pay me i help you build""",btohqsg
u up budget i do urs nicer le,btohqsg
He make a very good sales person,btohqsg
Next thing you know your car kena key,btohqsg
