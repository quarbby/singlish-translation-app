I saw that and my 2 cents are - Nopes not worth.The fees that you pay are equal to the price of flight whichever sector you travel.So with Payall  one is not earning or saving anything.I would rather look for cards which gives me money back.My thought process is either you should be able to save money or earn money,btohqsg

MorningDoes anyone what is the best card or method to pay for delivery in private hospital. Either to earn cash back or miles.Thank you,btohqsg
The link points are linked to your membership so if you are using the FairPrice app  just select the option to redeem when you are showing your QR code. If you are using the membership card  just tell the cashier that you wanna redeem the points. If you are using self checkout  can either select redemption of points on the terminal or select it via the mobile app,btohqsg
