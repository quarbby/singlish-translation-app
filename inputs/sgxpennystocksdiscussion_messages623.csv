Tech rout drags China shares lower after SEC hints at delistings1. Hong Kong-listed tech giants dragged Chinese stocks lower on Friday after the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) identified Chinese companies that will be delisted if they do not provide access to audit documents.2. The Hang Seng Tech Index (.HSTECH) dived more than 7%  dragging the Hang Seng Index (.HSI) down more than 3%  while China's onshore CSI300 Index (.CSI300) dropped more than 1% in early trade.3. Companies on the SEC list that are also listed in Hong Kong led the slump on Friday. Yum China Holdings (9987.HK)  Zai Lab   HUTCHMED (China) Ltd (0013.HK) and Beigene Ltd (6160.HK) fell between 8% and 15%.More here,btohqsg

Above is Nickel Spot which was squeeze up and then LME halted it on 8th Mar 22 while below chart is SilKroad nickel (weekly)Back when SilKroad Nickel was at $0.465 on 22nd Feb 21  Nickel Spot was trading at $20k only.Nickel spot was last trading about $60k before the Halt which was 3x of 20k nickel spot when SilKroad was at $0.465.Therefore  i believe much more game ahead for this one.DYODD,btohqsg
Calling out for BBs. Please squeeze up this one.,btohqsg
Yea sure  thanks for the heads up,btohqsg
Wonder when they will unhalt though. Ultimately  Russia accounts for around 7% of global production of nickel  which is used to make stainless steel and batteries for electric vehicles.The fact that EV will take over the automotive industry over time means demand for Nickel will be there.Hence  Silkroad Nickel will be a beneficiary. Good investment opportunity perhaps.DYODD,btohqsg

✈️Pika World Afternoon Update- 11 March 2022✈️🧨The Rise and Fall🗽The equity market had a rough start after the war talks between Russia and Ukraine failed to deliver any positive outcome. Moreover  inflation runs hot to hit a 40-year high. Despite this  the equity market appeared to be supported  moving towards the closing.Given that the Ukrainian foreign minister indicated no progress in the talk on a cease-fire agreement and continuous intensifying attacks by the Russian  it appears to be a dark period for the region.🛎Oil price stabilizing📉Oil prices typically run up at such geopolitical risk  but they turned lower while the US ban on imports of Russian oil bites the market. Nevertheless  the prospect of higher oil prices could curtail consumer demand  applying a cooling gel on the economy and lead to persistently higher inflation  which is feared to reach a stagflation stage.🍎CPI on fever💣Consumer Price Index sent a chilling stark truth that inflation is here to stay. The annual rate of 7.9% jump for February shows the widespread inflation. Notably  Core CPI  which excludes the more volatile items such as oil and food prices  rose 6.4%  well ahead of the 5.9% expectation. This evokes the idea that  indeed  the invisible hands of inflationary forces are hammering on consumers and the economy.The Fed faced a more challenging job. Next week FOMC is likely to see rate rise by 0.25% and multiple more in subsequent meetings to tame inflation. On the other hand  if inflation readings do not improve  a more aggressive stance might be warranted  weighing on the economy's growth engine. A delicate balance is  therefore  an uphill task.💰Our Actions🎙Pika World sees a broadening of the inflation and is  therefore  less keen to aggressive add on more positions. Our alternative asset portfolio is also partly hurt by Pika Nat degen mode (LOL)  and thus we will tune in to a more conservative approach in the month ahead.This year is a challenging year for portfolio returns. Still  we remain optimistic for better days ahead as geopolitical tensions coupled with a tighter monetary regime present market participants with whole new dynamics to adapt to.Cheers Pika Nat,btohqsg

What time is the buying in?,btohqsg
The buy-in session will commence from 4pm to 5pm on T+2. If buy-in is not successful by the end of T+2  buy-in will continue from 4pm to 5pm on T+3.The starting buy-in price for any security is 2 minimum bids above either the previous day’s closing price or any of the transacted or bid prices in one hour preceding commencement of the buy-in  whichever is higher. The buy-in bid prices will increase by 2 minimum bids from time to time throughout the day until the securities are bought in by CDP.As the security may be bought in at different prices during the course of the buy-in session for the day  the effective buy-in price charged to the short seller will be the volume weighted-average price for the security rounded up to 5 decimals places.,btohqsg

That's actually good for you. Low carb 😅,btohqsg
You guys realize why the Chinese guy is massively short Nickel right?,btohqsg
The crisis could end without losses for the banks and for Xiang. Tsingshan Holding  asone of the world's largest nickel producers  could benefit from the increase in price if it can get through this patch. Also  if Xiang holds on to his short position and nickel prices decline after the LME reopens  the amount he owes the banks and brokers could fall drastically.,btohqsg
The Chinese guy is hedging his nickel stores against price downside by Shorting futures,btohqsg
This is a normal move for commodity producers,btohqsg
Lots of articles do not mention this and it sounds like he was speculating. This is why the parties are willing to negotiate with him,btohqsg
And why the LME did what it did,btohqsg
Regardless of the demand for Nickel there's no doubt that alot of it is speculation,btohqsg
We don't know whether it is normal hedging or speculating. If over hedging can look like speculating. He can over short what he can supply in the future.,btohqsg
How to Use Commodity Futures to Hedgehttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/022415/how-use-commodity-futures-hedge.asp#:~:text=In%20the%20world%20of%20commodities physical%20form%20in%20the%20future.,btohqsg
Maybe but at least he's a producer and one of the largest in the world,btohqsg
Not some financial firm or unrelated industry,btohqsg
If anything he has a reason to be Short more than anyone else,btohqsg
The LME suspension is giving him some time to cough up the margin,btohqsg
He just needs to survive this and his stores of Nickel will pay well if the price inflation remains,btohqsg
My point is that many articles in the news never mentioned he was a Nickel producer and one of the largest in the world. This is why context is so important,btohqsg
