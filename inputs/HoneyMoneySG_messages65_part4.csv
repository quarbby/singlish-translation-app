Is this considered the catch ?,btohqsg
3-5 daysI also told them I was going Macau they offered to send this. Simple stuff but I think at least they offered,btohqsg
I think need to be very specific with request hahaha,btohqsg
I heard some other concierge can be very proactive. When planning for a trip  they may even give you options you may not think of. They are supposed to be travel experts since they have a team. But not sure why the visa concierge in sg seems like they just do whatever we instruct them to. No more no less ü•≤,btohqsg
Concierge is different from traveling consultant. Their job scopes are very different.,btohqsg
Actually the Macau plan was done by travel team. The concierge told me they will forward the request to travel team.I think generally concierge are meant for simple task especially to contact overseas restaurants or source for items.Too complex stuff either you pay for concierge service or do yourself,btohqsg
There is a paid option for visa concierge?,btohqsg
Hi gurus For BTO Income Ceiling Eligibility (< $14 000) and EHG Housing Grant (< $9 000)  are bonuses (13th month and performance) assessed as part of income?,btohqsg
I believe bonus and OT pay are typically not included for calculation of income ceiling:https://blog.moneysmart.sg/property/hdb-income-ceiling-bto-ec-resale/,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGno more update for Aug and Sep?,btohqsg
can the min. spend of $500 within 30 days be done through citi > amaze?,btohqsg
Hi all  since Citi rewards only have 1k cap of spending for rewards  what other cards do you use to supplement if you were to spend more that month?,btohqsg
What type of Spent? Uob lady solitaire is good,btohqsg
Just want to check  I have just met my salary credit and credit card spending for sep. when will I see my bonus interests credited? My first time hit.,btohqsg
Apologies of this had been asked earlier. About the Moomoo welcome gift  both Reward 2 and 3 are giving Tesla fractional shares. Do I need to make total of 13 buy trades to get both Reward 2 and 3  or 10 buy trades will suffice because it says stackable?I plan to buy Fullerton Cash fund. Is Moomoo Cash Plus using Fullerton Cash Fund? If so  then I'll probably deposit 79 000 to enjoy 5.8% for 30 days. Then make 10 buy trades on Fullerton  each amounting to $100. This will the cap of $80k for 5.8% under Cash Plus will be reached.Is this correct or I misunderstood? TIA,btohqsg
has anyone managed to successfully trigger the UOB one salary crediting via paynow before? what are the exact steps do you have to do?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs actually on the uob one website & faq,btohqsg
What cards would you guys recommend me to buy taobao?,btohqsg
Im holding other SC cards. Is there any sign up promo (ie. getting paynow cash) for applying SC Smart visa credit card?,btohqsg

Is there a way to find my Link membership number via the Trust app?I‚Äôm trying to link my ntuc app to the link membership  but I cannot find the membership number,btohqsg
Go download this app.  Use SingPass to login. Then go to 'memberships & cards'. You should be able to find your membership number,btohqsg
Hmm my impression is Trust card will create a link membership? But it doesn‚Äôt show anything.,btohqsg
Try this app   go to 'Link Membership'  then 'View Cards',btohqsg
Hmm looks like you may need to contact them. I can see my card details in both apps,btohqsg
I tried putting my trust card number it doesnt work,btohqsg
For me  they updated in their backend system.  I dunt even need to enter anything and it is displayed,btohqsg
I would think so.Okay thanks I‚Äôll contact trust for it,btohqsg
Nope  I put in my trust card number also cannot.It‚Äôs okay I‚Äôve already send a mail to ntuc,btohqsg
What I recall is you don't need to do anything.. as long your phone number or email is the same  your Trust card and even older link-based cards will be added automatically.,btohqsg
I tried to input my phone and email into the forms also cannot link lolI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the issue though.I contacted ntuc. It‚Äôs more for using the ntuc app to clock the online payment. Don‚Äôt wanna waste the link points too üòÇ,btohqsg
Your Trust Bank account using the same email and phone number?,btohqsg
Can i check  would monthly recurring transfer to roboadvisors like syfe be included under UOB One giro payment?,btohqsg
Do you see linkpoints under rewards in Trust app?,btohqsg
Maybe for now use the card ba üòÖ then see what NTUC says.,btohqsg
Another way is to actually just go ntuc and buy something  the membership number should appear on the receipt then I can try link,btohqsg
Oh sorry sorry my bad  favepay not eligible for 4mpd on dbs wwmc,btohqsg
No worries üòÇ I just charged $800 to dbs WWMC,btohqsg
Actually this query related DBS WWMC+Favepay already mentioned multiple times in the chat history. Just do a simple search can find the answer.,btohqsg
2ii - FavePay is excluded from 10x for DBS World Woman Card (DBS WWMC),btohqsg
Hi guys  what's ur current miles/Cashback strategy?,btohqsg

did some research on the instarem amaze card. my younger bro has it. and does not recommend me to get as it is not really worth.,btohqsg
What is the reasons? Can share?,btohqsg
Why not worth.It‚Äôs free and has no downside other than occasional declined transactions.,btohqsg
ya la. but my bro has used it and just say not worth to apply for it.,btohqsg
Heh heh I would say many of people who have used Instarem amaze would disagree.I would concede the amaze Instarem has less attractiveness compared to the start. But still very useful.,btohqsg
I am using HSBC Revolution + Citi Rewards. HSBC Revolution as my main card to charge for Food  Grocery and others eligible for HSBC. Anything above 1k or other categories  I use Citi Rewards,btohqsg
Pairing Instarem Amaze with Citi Rewards gives you the Ultimate 4MPD card. I had really good experience so far,btohqsg
