We don't take onions all the way from USA ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I think local have their own production factory,btohqsg
Makes no sense to ship from there,btohqsg
hearsay both have more than enough $$ to last for 2-3 generations from late MM Lee.factually  i'd just set it to referendum whether or not to demolish in accordance to MM Lee KY's will,btohqsg
Portion bigger than 2 samurai meals?,btohqsg
which is what Late MM Lee was against.,btohqsg
I guess now the challenge is whether which is his last wish,btohqsg
If lhy did the last will with another lawyer that is not his wife  I think the fight is more on lhy side. But stupid la  use his wife for what.,btohqsg
Actually none of our biz ...,btohqsg
The national heritage board like damn easy job also. Collect govt package every month to look at old stuff.,btohqsg
Ya lo. If really want us to remember his father should actually give us holiday. Instead of printing his dad face on some coins or yeos' drink,btohqsg
Actually his wish is to demolish it,btohqsg
Why they so against it ah,btohqsg
Fella did so much for sg (whether u respect him or not) but canâ€™t even have his dying wish granted,btohqsg
Totally defeated the purpose of drafting a will before death,btohqsg
Ya I also dunno what the big fuss is,btohqsg
Family feuds are often starts petty thing then blow up into big fuss,btohqsg
Then 7th month gonna have new meme coming up lo,btohqsg
This one really big fuss. Not like any other family issues,btohqsg
The contention was that lky will changed a few times to include exclude demolition but it was done with same lawyer. But the last will was done by lhy wife  and is demolish.,btohqsg
Actually U all see sg politics a long time  will know one. If U do things swee swee  they don't wanna touch. But once U display weakness  gg.,btohqsg
Demolish la. At worst take photos of the insides  set up a section in the founders memorial. ðŸ¤” Why hang on to the building and make everyone who has a stake in it and by extension  SGP become laughing stock on world stage?Own household as eldest brother also CMI.. how much more of MMLee's face is being laughed at esp by China and India..?,btohqsg
The land belongs to the govt. Even after demolish  it doesnâ€™t have to be used as a milking site per say. Lkys legacy transcends beyond his residence. In fact  it doesnâ€™t play any part in the formation of Singaporeâ€™s history.,btohqsg
Eh is this yday de sb?,btohqsg

Sometimes you need a witch wife to appreciate all the models,btohqsg
