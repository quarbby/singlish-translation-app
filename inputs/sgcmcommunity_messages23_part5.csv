Honestly   i think our society is quite practical and i dont think going green and save my Earth is the main reasons why people choose EV. Can be as practical as cheaper electricity or as simple as it looks so damn cool to drive one ... I mean i have 2 friends that drive telsa and 1 MG EV  it is more about being the first few ..,btohqsg
Again  misinformation. More than 92% of the battery can and will be recycled LOL.,btohqsg
okay wait so whats the point?,btohqsg
Battery is the worse environment cause if i may say so,btohqsg
Many drive for the hype  some drive for the instant torque. Very few drive to go green because EVs not completely green as yet,btohqsg
so volvo did a study and managed to determind it cost more environmentally to make EVS,btohqsg
One requires constant release of emissions  while the other has the opportunity to run on true zero emission when charged by renewables,btohqsg
Maybe you can cite your sources? Or your sources are WhatsApp university also? I've cited mine clearly,btohqsg
As usual. Singaporean first mentality. First in class  first as a symbol of winning status,btohqsg
Agree.. but 3 min?  I go pump petrol for passenger car... walk into the station  buy snacks... queue up.. and normally still NOT ready yet for me to pay... can't be 3 min for full tank ba,btohqsg
Check out the impact report from 2020 and 2021. Approximately 93% of the battery after stripping down is recycled,btohqsg
Look like those alien ðŸ‘½ in Star Wars,btohqsg
Hi Ray  good to see you hereðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Unfortunately  the EV xc40 is manufactured on a ice platform and converted hence it will take more energy to be made. It was never designed as a ground up EV,btohqsg
Only those do selfservice can achieve.,btohqsg
good point! so what are we comparing now? Tesla vs ICE or General EV vs ICE,btohqsg
Pump $30 can be done in 3-mins for sure,btohqsg
All talks about fuel use vs electricity to run. Production emissions not mentioned apart from them using solar panels on top of factories to reduce their emissions,btohqsg
I have an old Ice and EV. Both have their fun. But daily  thereâ€™s really no comparison to an EV. No hype here  but maybe I donâ€™t fancy paying $3.50 per litre to go 10km,btohqsg
EV and ICE conversations always feel like iphone and samsung conversation we had like n years ago ... haha ..,btohqsg
because tesla dont make ICE carsðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±,btohqsg
they did just get taken off the s&p 500 for their lack of environmental strategy and poor working conditions at their factories.... yes....,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s gonna be legacy EVs as well as a lot of new ground up designed EVs. The ground up designs will surely be streamlined and use less energy to produce,btohqsg
I'm usually pumping 45 to 55L as I don't let the tank run down completely,btohqsg
Many Petrol kiosk has bubble tea outletsðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚They bring them jam ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
that is true too. but in singapore  no escape one. pay now or later. road tax or pump cost.,btohqsg
3 min? wait.. there is the law of physics as well.. aka Flow RateI don't think we can adjust flow rate when we self-service :),btohqsg
I do believe that in many countries EVs can serve as great dailies/city commute cars! Such as in Europe  major benefits. But in the Singaporean context  not there yet and not there to completely replace ICE,btohqsg
55L.. similar to what I did .. .but that takes much longer than 3 min...interesting... which petrol station do you go to?,btohqsg
Very true.Cost of Electricity will go up soonUnless we turn to Nuclear Power Station ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Agree with your point on both being fun!,btohqsg
Good for you to have two cars. How many can afford two in sg? I think in all fairness just stick to one car ownerships as a choice to decide whether ice or ev.,btohqsg
Refer to page 59 of the impact report. Lifetime emissions including upstream supply chain and manufacturing.,btohqsg
Eventually we will convert all to EV and save the earth .. But i think sticking to ICE for the next few years doesnt mean we like to pay more for fuel la ..Practical reasons- no convenient charging port- no extra time to wait while charing- EV car overall are more expensive - most cars- not enough infrastructure to support mass EV charging- no $$$ la - stay HDB and my carpark no charging port,btohqsg
I think for 50L tank cannot.,btohqsg
"Interesting view :)Why ""not there yet""? or ... what can get Singapore there :)",btohqsg
One going to scrap soon. Coe so high how to sell cheap?,btohqsg
Yeah.. i was checking on the flow rate... it's very odd,btohqsg
Drive to petrol kiosk 10mins  pump5 mins  drive home 10mins.Must well drive to shopping mall to do charging while doing groceries or makan.,btohqsg
Thanks. Odd. next time you pump.. if you don't mind  can you time it for 50litres? thanks! It's possible your station pump rate is super high,btohqsg
Actually singapore is perfect for EV. The daily driver doesnâ€™t drive more than 50km.,btohqsg
Ya lo .. got so slow de meh .. when i want to aim 30L  looked at my phone then realise i pump full tank le ..,btohqsg
Coe still cheaper than new car prices,btohqsg
and still take 10 min to drive home.. wait for 5 min for cars to exit .. haha,btohqsg
Singapore donâ€™t even need DC charging for normal mileage people. We just need more AC charger around,btohqsg
Some literally see the petrol kiosk at their doorsteps,btohqsg
Dc charging only for taxi and private hire drivers,btohqsg
Alamak. I never calculate that much leh,btohqsg
They will compete the same space after midnight,btohqsg
should be abt there   but 1-2minutes doesnt make a big diff laðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
