Does anyone know if we use Instarem + Citi cashback to top up grab will incur extra charges with Citibank anot?,btohqsg
They send me some Citi-credit limit statement I shock,btohqsg
statement only can see adjusted points lump sum  mixed with 1x point. If want to monitor bonus points  need to minus off the 1x points. Or monitor total points each day close to 20th.,btohqsg
"dun think there is extra charges for this if you meant Amaze card linked with citi cashback. What u mean by ""credit limit statement""? what u see in the statement? Why using this anyway  no rebate  dun clock min spend.",btohqsg
I tried using GXS to pay for grab cause of their points promotion now  but keep unable to authorize on grab app,btohqsg
Dk is it cause I never transfer the amount from the savings pocket to the main pocket,btohqsg
ok  i will take a look  they just send me an email whenever i top up my grab card  which is so weird  cause they dont usually dont and then there is like a credit ready/ credit card charges,btohqsg
I think immediately opening the account got 1 working day before fast is enable  I had issue also but just wait 1 working day it will be okay,btohqsg
Balance that grab deduct need to be from main saving account not from savings pocket,btohqsg
what is the exact description of the charge?,btohqsg
Just want to double confirm thatHigh Yield Savings Plus Accountno need to maintain min $ in account right? No fall below fee,btohqsg
You see the service you are doing is top up to wallet then pay some grab service,btohqsg
i think charge directly via amaze,btohqsg
its my first time doing something like that so im not sure if you all have this before,btohqsg
Oh great thanks for letting me know,btohqsg
I think better to check the transaction type that grab did,btohqsg
Or you paying their pay later,btohqsg
Nope it‚Äôs to top up the wallet,btohqsg
No charge incurred ah only visa got,btohqsg
Anyone uses OCBC Titanium  is it an alternative to HSBC Revo card?,btohqsg
Ok I will update the chat if I got charge. Hahaha,btohqsg
Thank you all for the help,btohqsg
Someone was asking when will UOB ONE Saving bonus interest  for Jan be credited. You can see it your account now!!,btohqsg
This is a normal email sent by citi. I assume you topped up a amount that is higher then your set threshold  hence the email sent.For myself my threshold is $0.01 so I receive the email everytime thing the card is charged,btohqsg
Latest tbill at 3.88%. Seems like the 1 year tbill was not an outlier.,btohqsg
"I found that for the Salary crediting requirement  you can fulfill it by doing your own interbank transfer and put the Transfer purpose as ""Salary""..",btohqsg
You sure ? That works ??,btohqsg
Use fast fund transfer and put note Salary? Lol,btohqsg
Yes  I tried yesterday.. it is alreadly reflected as activities in my UOB TMRW,btohqsg
Then  I can have 2 salary crediting. 1 to ocbc and fast transfer to uob,btohqsg
"I transfer from DBS account  there is a dropdwon menu where you can select ""Salary""",btohqsg
Hmm ü§îüòèüòèüòè gonna try hahahaha üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
yeah you try and reconfirm here..,btohqsg
Guessing need wait for their system to reflect it see if detect,btohqsg
"see next month  whether they ""cancel"" it .. haha",btohqsg
Can't be refunded back to u lah maybe no detect as salary,btohqsg
"I saw in dbs ""purpose of transfer"" salary payment",btohqsg
"I mean whether they ""nullified"" that activity.. nevertheless  I am still crediting my actual salary from my Company la..",btohqsg
Wah lau. That means  its your company salary that take effect. Not the fund transfer,btohqsg
i Just open ONE account and will have my first salary crediting this month. But I still can see whether the my own transfer is still in record.,btohqsg
my own transfer yesterday was reflected,btohqsg
when my Co salary is credited  the activities will be the total of ($1 600+my salary)/$1 600,btohqsg
"if my $1 600 transfer is ""nuliffied""  then it will show only my salary/$1 600",btohqsg
Just wonder if this is loop hole or not,btohqsg
if it is from another account from a different name  it is difficult to filter..,btohqsg
The inverted relationship between 6-month and 1-year is now almost zero.,btohqsg

Correct me if I'm wrong  only certain cards are able to earn points/miles when purchasing air tickets  not all cards right?,btohqsg
Will amaze + Crmc give 10x for SimplyGo?,btohqsg
yes  the HSBC Revolution  DBS woman‚Äôs world card  and Amaze + CRMC are few examples that will give 4mpd.,btohqsg
Why not do a master file for the 4mpd cards or we can request u to do 1 for the list of cards we have,btohqsg
Yes that is the end goal if the response is good,btohqsg
amaze + crmc or hsbc revolution? anyone tried both and have thoughts to share?,btohqsg
yeah beside these card  other cards such as OCBC Titanium card for e.g won't earn any miles/points if use to purchase air tickets?,btohqsg
a very simple theory 1 card solution would be amaze plus crmc But if u want to be more into the game and your spending is about 2k or more U can just put all your dinings in HSBC revo card The rest then chuck it in crmc IF u still have other expenses then proceed with UOB PPV For big purchases like best denki  shopee  taobao  all this throw it in OCBC Titanium card It should be more then enuff,btohqsg
hoping for one Chris. a table,btohqsg
I don't think amaze crmc apply for air tickets,btohqsg
"A video on Citi Rewards + Amaze exclusions will be published tomorrow.Hopefully this will answer all your ""what card to use"" and ""will i get 4mpd"" questions",btohqsg
Hi  noobie question  how to convert Citibank points to miles? Will Kanna any extra fee?,btohqsg
Yes. Each transfer has a fee to pay for the transfer to any airline.,btohqsg
So its best one shot transfer,btohqsg
Just curious.sdic covers up to 75k. Would you put more than 75k in foreign banks such as RHB  SC  HSBC etc...?I read somewhere not recommended,btohqsg
Ic thanks  the fee is charge to the card or deduct from the points?,btohqsg
HiA question on CPF MA.Understand that the Interest from MA will flow to OA in 2023 if we hit FRS and BHA in 2022.Does that mean that we need to build it up monthly via our job again 2023 since now we have only 66k,btohqsg
If not wrong 25$ per tranfer,btohqsg
But im not sure if transfer to kris+ and from kris+ to krisflyer is free or not,btohqsg
hi all can confirm ? For additional 1% for HSBC Revolution card  do I have to increase my EGA account balance by 2k every month ? or can just transfer in 2k and transfer out 2k immediately every month ?,btohqsg
Can go in and go out no problem,btohqsg
Your MA‚Äôs interest at the end of the year will help you grow your MA balance to new limit.,btohqsg
What you said is correct. But if you are receiving AWS or bonus in Dec ... the Jan contribution will likely top up your MA until it hits the new limit straightaway. That is why we try to do VCMA before the Jan contribution.,btohqsg
anyone here have invested in this? looking for true review after being talked to by bank consultant,btohqsg
Will they prompt you once you have met the requirements for the additional 1%?,btohqsg
Hi there! Anyone know amex card able to pay Manulife premium?,btohqsg
My interest didnt go back to MA after being moved to OA. So it kind of resetted to 66k.,btohqsg
My contribution was done in dec so now i got to slowly build up again.  my initial understanding was the interest will moved back to MA so that i do not need to worry about the BHS increase. So im wrong until i check recently that my MA is below BHS,btohqsg
I‚Äôm a prudential senior agent. My advise is if you can invest in yourself. Do it yourself.,btohqsg
2ndly. If u really want to go for it. U better find an agent. And don‚Äôt go with bank. Because u won‚Äôt get the after service if you want to switch portfolios,btohqsg
The problem with insurance agent also the same. They don't service the client after 3 years becos no more commission. So  everything still have to do ourself,btohqsg
When call the agent  they will say busy when they heard that no potential income.,btohqsg
So  whether bank or insurance agent. Is the same,btohqsg
You must really have a bad one bro ..,btohqsg
That agent that I know. Have been with him for 20+ years,btohqsg

(A) price on expiry <2.5  nothing happens  you hold on to your 100 shares and keep the premiums u had when you sold the option. (B) Price on expiry >2.5  you sell your 100 shares at $2.5 (even if actual price on expiry date is $100). You still profit but probably not happy that you could have sold it at $100 instead of $2.5,btohqsg

Ask yourself if $20k (10 months) is a good enough buffer should you lose your job.Also depends on how much job security you think you have.,btohqsg
Like i said in CPF Housing video.As long as you have $20K OA with Full FRS and BHS  you are in pretty good shape compared to other people.Also depends on how much job security you think you have.Not financial advice though  as you have to calculate for your own.,btohqsg

100k times 0.05 divide by 12 months ‚âà 420/mth,btohqsg
thanks  I'm guessing 5%. I just found my answer from the website.  5% is EIR..,btohqsg
100k deposit (u can do with less but max EIR is achieved with 100k) + spend $500 on UOB One CC + credit min $1600 of salary each month by employer (must appear on statement as SALA or SALA PAYNOW),btohqsg
Just use their official calculator here for quick referencehttps://www.uob.com.sg/personal/save/everyday-accounts/one-account.page,btohqsg
thanks so much  I was silly  never check.,btohqsg
I'm just keeping a max of 100K .. didnt see anything more if you exceed 100K savings..,btohqsg
Ya their calculator will generate the exact u get  even if u put like $110k for example,btohqsg
Though keep in mind that their calculator will show u $5203 as the interest earned (they sneakily added in the total of $200/year from the card rebates you‚Äôll get from spending $500 a month),btohqsg
it works  anything more than 100K  the EIR is not attractive..,btohqsg

Those cannot apply is because of the gift on singsaver I believe. If you have a cc  u are existing customer  u HAVE to go down to the branch  cannot do online. I called them to check  a bit silly but this is the process‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Just wanted to share that if you‚Äôve reached FRS  do keep a look out for when your MA gets deducted for medical or insurance. You can use that opportunity to top-up your MA to get tax relief.,btohqsg

Can try to use something e.g. way back machine and google search about past offers to determine‚Ä¶ No matter what after 1 year of cancelling all your cc with the bank you are new to bank again‚Ä¶ so just apply if you think the offer is good enough haha,btohqsg

nope it like citicashback+ earn 1.6% if the spread is worst then 1.6 or 2 then a bit no point  hence to use must try to use higher rewarding card like CRMC or maybank family and friends or the citibank cashback which earn 4mpd or 6-8% cashback,btohqsg

CardUp wouldn‚Äôt work on that right? Just want to double confirm. Thank you Adam!,btohqsg
No won't work. As a matter of fact cardup doesn't work on any known 4 mpd card,btohqsg
ahh i see thanks Adam! privi miles have never failed me for cardup. however it only gives 1.4mpd  in blocks of $5  do you have any recommendations?,btohqsg
At the $30k level that's the best you can do. Anyway with big bills like those you pay on cardup  the $5 rounding effect becomes less penalizing,btohqsg

even FAST also count?? wah thats good!!,btohqsg
I've been thinking about OCBC Div+ at 3.3% or esaver at 3.8%. But esaver seems to be only on the monthly incremental balance which is a little confusing,btohqsg
Just read that must put funds in there until end June to get the bonuses interest and bonuses interest is only on incrmenrntal ADB,btohqsg
OCBC  div+ still the best option with minimal conditions at 3.3%? Anything better out there?,btohqsg
Dl the app and register first!,btohqsg
After 20 plus mins they auto hang my call,btohqsg
Wa... like tat citi is much better. Citi I never wait more that 10 mins,btohqsg

everything u put in now is fresh fund ah (if no deposit in Jan),btohqsg
only get 10x points for mcc in the whitelist in the TnC. Otherwise 1√ó points only.,btohqsg
If placing there 4 months  only first month Will get 4.5-4.7%  right because it is based on incremental fund. Hence  2nd month onwards will not get bonus interest. Correct?,btohqsg
no  all 4 months get 4.5%-4.7% cos reference month is in Jan.,btohqsg
Anyway to earn cashback on cc while topping up to CPF?,btohqsg

oh  then Amex TCB top up GPMC then pay with GPMC,btohqsg
Ok ok. TksAny idea if pay by DBS live fresh card  will I enjoy 5% rebate ?,btohqsg
Yes cardup works but I believe DBS Live Fresh doesn't earn 5% on CardUp,btohqsg
Hi  may i check that does it mean need to top up min 2K to enjoy the additional 1%? Tks,btohqsg
You just need to have $2k fresh funds (i.e. not from HSBC) transferred in. What you do with the $2k afterwards is entirely up to you. I typically just transfer the money out immediately,btohqsg
can i ask what is the best mile card for insurance payments? i read that maybank visa horizon is the option with 1.4mpd,btohqsg
Maybank Visa Infinite is 1.2 mpdMaybank Horizon Visa is 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
ohh.. tks for the correction.. üôè,btohqsg
any hidden clause for visa infinite?,btohqsg
Hi does maybank have promo gifts often?Wanted to sign up for Maybank Platinum visa but no promo currently? Thinking to wait or just sign up,btohqsg
There's a fall below fee if fall below $2k but other than that no need to maintain the fresh funds every month,btohqsg
You need to earn $150k and if you don't spend enough ($60k per year) they will charge AF (first year fee is waived),btohqsg
So the reference month is only in January? It's not reference to the month before?,btohqsg
from what I understand... this is under the everyday global rewards programme... which is 1% applied on the incremental adb when min $2k fresh funds added... for 1st month (if new a/c)  previous mth is $0... so the 1% is applied on the $2k or if one funded eg. $75k  the 1% applies on that $75k  but next mth  if u add in another $2k  the 1% interest will only apply on the $2k... since the incremental adb btw th 2mths is nw $2k only... you mentioned u tsfr out the $2k immediately... so they still gave the 1% interest on that $2k since it din stay in the a/c for the whole mth?,btohqsg
That's two different promos. You're referring to the interest on the incremental ADB which of course you have to maintain the balance in the account. There's another promo which is 1% cashback on GIRO and credit card transactions. Qualifying criteria for that is $2k fresh funds transfer and 5 transaction,btohqsg
yeah this wan is the everday global rewards prog right.. $2k fresh fund + 5 txns... so they still gave u 1% interest on the $2k even though u tsf out the amt immediately?,btohqsg
Of course not since it's based on incremental ADB,btohqsg
ahh? then u tsfr in/out is juz to satisfy the criteria...,btohqsg
I merry go round my funds with RHB HYSA... This month my funds in RHB. Next month will go back to EGA,btohqsg

Can anyone advise how OCBC 360 works for bonus interest?Like I have 90k of saving in there.But my salary deposit date is around 27-31 of every month.That means i am still eligible to receive bonus interest for my 90k at the end of each month because I am a bit confused.,btohqsg
dun think so  separate accounts  just spend the cashback,btohqsg
Keep both cards if possible  just in case of large spending. There are some people who keep both the Visa and MC version of Citi Rewards so they got $2k monthly cap,btohqsg
Noted  as long as get af waiver üëå,btohqsg
Quick question: for someone who has let‚Äôs say 50k and a salary of 4k/month  why would he choose to put his 50k in highest fixed deposit (~4.1%) instead of SC bonus saver account (say He fulfils 3/5 conditions) @~4.88% ?Just wanted to hear your feedback,btohqsg
FD interest is fixed. Bank interest rates can vary.Maybe lazy to fulfill conditions,btohqsg
So you mean when they announce 7.88% for all conditions fullfiled  it might only be for a few months? And not even for a year?,btohqsg
yes. actually sc not so good  spend on bonussaver card no rebate,btohqsg
Whats the average time they keep to their announced promo rate? Based on your experience‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Ezlink and a few others like mc do isn‚Äôt it?,btohqsg
bonussaver need to spend on bonussaver card that does not give rebate only count to meet requirements for bonus interest,btohqsg
Min is $500 spend / month‚Ä¶ quite easy to reach‚Ä¶$2000 im not sure,btohqsg
for the bonus interest promo for 4.5%-4.7% for feb-jun  only based on reference month Jan.,btohqsg
So if Jan only $1000 in HSBC  then feb onwards there's 50k  the incremental bonus interest is applied on the 49k?,btohqsg
Any Tuas power electricity customer here?,btohqsg
Yeah hence why people go with SSB or t bill cause it guaranteed while this saving account is as long as they give could be next month they drop the rate if bank interest rate drop,btohqsg
may I know what are Tuas volts used for?,btohqsg
It depends on macroeconomic conditions. If this week suddenly Fed announce U Turn and going to cut interest rates  then bank rates will shortly follow. If status quo then the interest rate can maintain v long one,btohqsg
Just want to know if I work overseas but want to apply Singapore credit card. Is it possible?,btohqsg

If you are Singaporean  just apply with MyInfo,btohqsg
actually if u using credit cards overseas  why apply singapore card instead of applying their local cards?,btohqsg
Actually I want to use it in Singapore when I come back for holidays,btohqsg
The main issue is the income requirement which if you work overseas for some time will appear as 0. So most banks will decline. But perhaps if you have a sizeable amount of cash in your bank account it could be approved.,btohqsg
The second option most likely put $10-20k into FD to get a secured version,btohqsg
I assume oversea income statement won‚Äôt be recognise by Singapore bank,btohqsg
Depends which country u pay your income tax I guess.,btohqsg

Just curious why GE? I don't have private insurance since I don't believe in double paying (we all pay for medishield life already),btohqsg
Medishield no pre and post hospitalisation claim i think?,btohqsg
Nope but not worth it for how much you pay for private insurance. Unless you every year hospitalised,btohqsg
If you have the financial bandwidth  I personally feel that you should consider upgrading all shield plans (medishield & careshield / eldershield) with private insurers to increase your coverage. The basic gov shield plans are pretty basic  premiums are generally afforable and part (if not all) of the premiums can be paid using MA.,btohqsg
MOH has a comparison page to compare all the integrated Medshield plans :https://www.moh.gov.sg/cost-financing/healthcare-schemes-subsidies/medishield-life/comparison-of-integrated-shield-plans,btohqsg
Sorry quick question:Will Gpay+Amaze+CRMC be eligible for 4mpd (assuming not for travel - 7-11  etc)?,btohqsg
Not I can't afford it. I don't want to double pay. If medishield were optional then I would consider opting for a better private insurance. By principal I dislike double paying. No as if I don't claim medishield or healthcare insurance I will get in premium rebate,btohqsg
And it limits ur options also  unless u willing to pay when immediate medical attention is needed. Imagine ur family doctor finds some issues with ur daughter n ask her to get tested asap  r u okay to tell ur daughter to wait a few months for slot at public hospital?,btohqsg
Besides my workplace also have hospitalisation insurance so that would be triple coverage,btohqsg
An intergrated shield plan complements the basic medishield plan.. it does not double count. This screenshot show what the basic medishield covers... it is sorely lacking.,btohqsg
Medical emergencies don't work that way. I used to work in a hospital so you cant use your whatifs to scare me.,btohqsg
Beside I know restructured hospitals have better equipment,btohqsg
Maybe not the best specialist and aftercare but I'm not looking for hotel I just want to get out ASAP,btohqsg
Good for u  hope it dosnt happen to u then. But good luck to u if u think such situations dosnt happen  im jus sharing what i personally know.,btohqsg
I already said in earlier msg that my employer have hospitalisation plan for all staff,btohqsg
So the thing about health insurance is that  once you kena anything  it will be hard to get any form of health insurance after that. If you kena anything serious whilst you're still working  the company insurance will pay the initial  medical bills... but what if you can't work anymore and the company eventually has to let you go... this is when you'll need to rely on your personal health insurance.,btohqsg
Do consider the very limited coverage though...,btohqsg
Like I said I used to work in a hospital so I know what kind of coverage I need. If I can opt for C class I would but means tested,btohqsg
Yes if it not travel or excluded mcc it will earn 4mpd,btohqsg
There is no right or wrong on using MediShield or buying private integrated insurance.Something you need to consider are:1). Cost2). The service provided. Similar to you want to take budget  economy  business or first class .3). Are you comfortable to stay in a 6-8 bedders class or single room ward.4). Company insurance is not transferrable. Once kena medical board out  you may left with little option.5). Waiting time.6). MediShield got co-pay only.7). Your income status can afford first class status. If not  then opt for budget/economy class. No right no wrong.8)‚Ä¶.You want to to talk to agent or search internet to compare the different and make a decision.Nothing is perfect. Both options are not 100% perfect.,btohqsg
Is purchasing concert tickets an exclusion for citibank rewards?,btohqsg
"My personal opinion is that it's easy to dismiss ""needs"" whenever oneself is healthy. If you shift the situation from covering yourself to buying insurance for a loved one  more often than not you'd rather have better coverage as it means saving time and having more treatment options (since rarer or newer treatment options will definitely cost more). Sometimes paying a little extra is worth a little less suffering  but of course your viewpoint is also totally valid too.",btohqsg

I'd let my loved one be their own judge. When I was young I hated being forced by parents to do anything. So why would I force someone to buy insurance if they don't want to. Insurance agents sound like some kind of cult leader trying to convert non-believers,btohqsg
