You know i dont even rmb what the new club is called,btohqsg
Tan kwok wai is OG bruh everyone who dislike him simply just doesnt pay attention in class/never put in effort to try,btohqsg
Juz cause no one else can do ir doswnt mean i cant be the first one,btohqsg
She did it lol shes in nus now,btohqsg
Some math teacher that came from rjc to mi,btohqsg
Cause theres an old guy here rn and his h1 class is like failing,btohqsg
I wouldnt call him old...? Maybe middle aged,btohqsg
How long has it been since yoi graduated agn ah,btohqsg
But he does teach h1 too so that sounds sus,btohqsg
Cause rn he looks like he cld be in an old folks home,btohqsg
I dont think he's the one,btohqsg
If the MI website is to be trusted and updated,btohqsg
My teacher has left MI already,btohqsg
But i think it kinda is because i dont see my chem and math teacher anymore and they left in 2022,btohqsg
Then u replace your teacher lor,btohqsg

even most of my teachers are gone from mi alr,btohqsg
apart from i think history math and econs,btohqsg
most of the good teachers left rlly quickly pre and post covid,btohqsg
Idk how hv i reached this stage where talking to my parents make me break down,btohqsg
They will just keep denying despite all the facts i hv abt the unfairness,btohqsg
Dw if im gonna be trying for ivy its not gonna be harvard,btohqsg
See that's why u need to go to MI and replace the brain drain,btohqsg

Very common RP accepts you with open arms,btohqsg
sometimes ppl do better in poly than in mi,btohqsg
My family tradition is authority is always right,btohqsg
U don't choose RP. RP chooses u,btohqsg
I cant hold my anger anymore,btohqsg
Bro gonna be forced into rp,btohqsg
i rmb my english teacher teased me about my crush once,btohqsg
Then my stupid aunt will always use my mum‚Äôs stress as an excuse,btohqsg
Rp even scammed Uni students to come back to poly üòÇ,btohqsg
at least not forced into ite,btohqsg
Idk if im the one unreasonable or them,btohqsg
My friend was in a foreign Uni  paid to attend rp when he came to sg,btohqsg
Sadly im neither engaged nor married,btohqsg
if old principal then tak boleh,btohqsg
I mean i leave in a landed,btohqsg
must be smth abt lifelong learning and ‚Äúoh a degree isnt enough heres a dip to supplement ur studies!‚Äù,btohqsg
but realistically how strong is an rp dip to a nus degree,btohqsg
I seen a few in RP too tbh. It's mainly cuz their university damn ulu name one,btohqsg
Or they wanna do in SG and get high paying job.,btohqsg
Can i ask which family decides to go on a holiday when one of their kid is studying for A levels,btohqsg
im p sure ur future companies wld prefer ur degree,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a super Low chance but still a chance none the less,btohqsg
I got classmates formerly from sp  results cui come rp,btohqsg
Then they say they hv no choice coz want to tag my mum‚Äôs business trip,btohqsg
then the company does not recognise the degree,btohqsg
Not if it's from Samchipanfien Unversity of Technology or some shit,btohqsg
I told them idw go they say they dc buy ticket alr,btohqsg
idts right its only moderately recognised,btohqsg
Wasn‚Äôt there a report some years ago  the govt realise some foreigners attended bogus unis,btohqsg
hearsay (and take it with a pinch of salt) some american companies dont even recognise nus ntu,btohqsg
And the trips that they are leaving me out  they had SQ in their options,btohqsg
They sent officials to the proposed address overseas and the building was not even there,btohqsg
They recognise as overseas degrees lor,btohqsg
And the trips that i go  they wun let me take SQ,btohqsg
wtf they dont recognise top universities in the world,btohqsg
more like they dk it exists,btohqsg
i got hear abt it a few yrs back,btohqsg
yea average americans: i suck at geography,btohqsg
but wld u be surprised its america,btohqsg
Should i spend$23 on a class jacket,btohqsg
Idk how many times i broke down this year,btohqsg
As long as the US department of education recognises it can liao,btohqsg
It's mainly a visa issue for now,btohqsg
Bro you know those general knowledge  a lot are scripted but it‚Äôs very concerning lmao,btohqsg
It literally shows the vulnerability of the USA,btohqsg
bro their presidental candidates are felon and dementia patient what do u expect,btohqsg
U never say their safe word rumchelWe have oil,btohqsg
I rmb watching a vid of them asking them to point the most hostile country to the us  they said iran,btohqsg
But guess where they pointed on the map,btohqsg
There's also the guy with a brain eating worm,btohqsg
who are going to die at any moment,btohqsg
Biden gonna die if he takes the next 4,btohqsg
Trump still pretty alright too bad he is a felon,btohqsg
wah then simpsons is correct lor,btohqsg
In o level history we learnt that the old age of the USSR leaders was one of the factors to their downfall,btohqsg
Anyways i hv not learnt my lesson not to argue w my mum‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Why are we repeating this again üíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
The argument success rate is 0%,btohqsg
Because we don‚Äôt learn from history,btohqsg
It wasn't rlly a downfall per say but what do I know.,btohqsg
I just gave them a simple condition if they are going to new zealand w/o me. And that is to not take SQ‚Ä¶they still buaysong,btohqsg
And that is what made it big,btohqsg
Oh yea talking about that didn‚Äôt Putin vision shift from reuniting the Soviet Union to just spreading influence,btohqsg
We talk as if america didn't assassinate like a quarter of their presidents,btohqsg
Then biden still said ‚ÄúPutin want to reunite the Soviet Union‚Äù,btohqsg
Nah man Putin just wants a neutral country to nato,btohqsg
Till this day statistically speaking the job of US president is still the most dangerous vocation,btohqsg
Oh I‚Äôll tell you what the worse part of the us I found out about this whole ordeal,btohqsg
Cuz we wan u to go to NS,btohqsg
i wanna trim myself but i could also wait to go salon,btohqsg
I dont see a problem what,btohqsg
ig ill wait a  week more,btohqsg
U are gonna have that privilege once u graduate MI,btohqsg
Or drop out.. what ever comes first,btohqsg
damn btw you know the US is literally breaking the weapons ban they imposed throughout nato by sending cluster bombs to ukraine,btohqsg
these americans.... They just care about others problems and couldnt help their own community,btohqsg
"""do as i say  not as i do""",btohqsg
Dun care. At least they stopped sending weapons and men to Vietnam..Minh,btohqsg
as long as dont go into your eye...should be fine,btohqsg
wah...i tell you the moment it reaches eye lenght  you not careful..the whole week you gonna have itchy eyes,btohqsg
Hey..at least they gonna build 4 more aircraft carriers,btohqsg
but the weapons one i dont,btohqsg
Better behave and not anger the US ah if not they bring back their Agent Orange,btohqsg
when the latest one they build cant even be deployed,btohqsg
reports are stating chemical warfare is being used in ukraine,btohqsg
Does he not teach the same way in class and in consults,btohqsg
But what do I know I failed H2 math under his tutelage lmao only passing end of Y2,btohqsg
That's better than most of MI in relative comparison,btohqsg
ye bro next thing you know..they build a base in sg,btohqsg
oh yea you know they got a base in the us called china lake,btohqsg
this is where they tested the B-2 Bombers  infamous for dropping both atomic bombs over hiroshima and nagasaki,btohqsg
Is there a psych sort of help relating to family relationship help,btohqsg
im not gonna let it go that long cause i prefer short bangs,btohqsg
nah you wont know until you suddenly rub your eyes,btohqsg
i kenna b4..i thought the hair was at my eyebrows..then i realise got one pesky strand somehow outgrew everything else and perfectly curls into my eyes,btohqsg
1 whole week of swollen eyes thanks to that,btohqsg
maybe cuz he dk how to command class attention,btohqsg
and i didnt take a math,btohqsg
so he spent abit of consult teaching me stuff that ppl who took a math wld know,btohqsg
Rn most of the tachers teaching me r like not that good or like you can see they dont really care one,btohqsg
She grad liaobut tbh I think she just needs medicationHelps/makes one stfu,btohqsg
6 months after for graduates rite?,btohqsg
I do care abt my studies,btohqsg
do u actively seek help and ask for consults,btohqsg
do u turn in extra papers and extra work and ask them to help u go thru tgt,btohqsg
sometimes theres only sm a teacher can do esp when they have to deal with 20+ occasionally rowdy kids,btohqsg
at least most of the teachers in my experience,btohqsg
Do u bribe them with food stuff with money underneath to make sure they give you an A?,btohqsg
if they know uw to work hard for ur results they will actually come and help u,btohqsg
i think the teachers are fine even tho they  can be quite eh,btohqsg
it js depends on ur own willingness to step out of the way to do something and study hard,btohqsg
and ‚Äúreadjng notes and doing practice papers‚Äù without clarifying anyth is far from enough,btohqsg
even uni kids seek consultation to clarify things they dont unds talk abt a lvls,btohqsg
Just 1 on 1 is always better imo,btohqsg
cuz its very tailored and detailed to suit what u need,btohqsg
which isnt = to what everyone needs,btohqsg
But got time u for ;) Lestin kor kor,btohqsg
I do occasionally seek help but some teachers legit strictly 8-6 on weekdays only like after that cannot text but i dont blame tho,btohqsg
I think Rachel would really know about going out of your way to seek for help,btohqsg
I no time for extra work üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
It prepares you for IHLs too as no one will give a shit to nudge you,btohqsg
do u rlly not have time or are u js too lazy to put in special effort to ur work,btohqsg
Sadge honestly seems like teachers now treasure their time,btohqsg
Not for mewith cocaine I have 48 hours in a day,btohqsg
Back when I was in MI I could spam WhatsApp for questions anytime I wanted,btohqsg
Who the dealer  where can I find,btohqsg
Im fitting 3 years worth of EC into one year as much as possible,btohqsg
Spam is one thing... they reply is another,btohqsg
Eh tele sorry my teachers used tele already  only tkw use WhatsApp like a nerd,btohqsg
twy made it ‚Äúillegal‚Äù to share numbers with students,btohqsg
I do have extra time but ive to manage my EC also,btohqsg
now that im on outlook with my profs,btohqsg
yall wld be surprised by how chill profs can be,btohqsg
Just schedule consult bi weekly or smth and then I consolidate questions all into that session and rapid fire.,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt have to share their number  just tele handle,btohqsg
I don't look at my outlook anymore,btohqsg
i can go out for meals with profs and tas they‚Äôre so chill,btohqsg
yeah thats what most teachers resolved to,btohqsg
The tenured ones are the most dun give a fuck ones,btohqsg
i wld tell u to kys if u wanted a call at 9pm,btohqsg
Ya like i said i dont blame them,btohqsg
or 6pm when i wld be eating with fam,btohqsg
So can I call u so u can tell me that?,btohqsg
Not call ah like juz text yhen next morning they reply or smth,btohqsg
tho i had a teacher that was so chill with the timing,btohqsg
Not me spamming my Chem teacher at 2am and her replying me immediately,btohqsg
hearsay had a call that lasted into 1am,btohqsg
This post is so fake üíÄ,btohqsg
Cause im not allowed to text outside 8 to 5 cause the cher wont reply,btohqsg
My prof sent me a 4am email before,btohqsg
And I responded. So he was like why tf are u still awake,btohqsg
But I never ever call teachers la idk why would anyone do that,btohqsg
I've submitted poly work at like 5am next day faci ask me  where your work,btohqsg
me when i start emailing profs at 3-4am,btohqsg
and i got ‚Äúsomeone didnt sleep last night‚Äù in class,btohqsg
I know a prof rite legit replies in 15 mins tops,btohqsg
I remember I send email at 10am I go grab bubble tea to sit down at Liho i get pinged back,btohqsg
My uni profs are all males,btohqsg

Bruh now my aunt is also attacking me‚Ä¶every time i quarrell w my mum  it is abt me self-victimizing,btohqsg
Actually I don‚Äôt remember what class was it and why did I have to go,btohqsg
so why didnt u js join us,btohqsg
Then everyone thinks i fail interview is my fault,btohqsg
Everyone does there was even a petition to remove it but err he disappear after meeting with the profs,btohqsg
My aunt just nagged at me for 15min about my attire,btohqsg
Somehow she and my mum keep picking on me,btohqsg
there are a lot of reasons,btohqsg
but we shall keep it away from you for now,btohqsg
you need to experience it yourself,btohqsg
There are some redeeming qualities but its not enough to make up,btohqsg
Pray that you dont have to,btohqsg
He have a lot of redeeming qualities,btohqsg
Lets just say self discipline wld make life better in MI,btohqsg
to brighten the image of the sch,btohqsg
Is there a nickname for mi like rp,btohqsg
many ppl come out with many different nicknames,btohqsg
Someone once said another nickname for rp is regenerative poly,btohqsg
The cir in mi more simillar to jc or poly,btohqsg
MI is JC rejects basically what,btohqsg
those who scored bad enough that they cant enter any poly except ite,btohqsg
I think rp got all the rejects name also,btohqsg
Now with RP that has changed liao,btohqsg
So MI is just JC rejects,btohqsg
So we are where they go when they graduate,btohqsg
Might even be the same school,btohqsg
How about I school your butt,btohqsg
Yes pls. Reminds me of the time they did a poll on which high school in the US Taylor Swift should perform at and the top vote was a school for Deaf Kids,btohqsg
Where is my uni KPOP concert experience sigh,btohqsg
GEM explorer to Ewha Woman's University and then just hope a Kpop group festival is occurring during your stint,btohqsg
Maybe I need a wig too while I‚Äôm at it,btohqsg
I dun think there is a stipulation that I need to have a vagina to qualify for exchange in a woman's university,btohqsg
Oh wait they do accept male students for exchange,btohqsg
Only issue is that I dun think they do physics,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have to map physics mods‚Ä¶ I think? Aren‚Äôt BDEs counted for mapping as well,btohqsg
Yep it's the easiest. But tbh if u just wanna map BDEs just do a GEM discoverer,btohqsg
Forgtten about 1 thing.GEM explorer matches by GPA.,btohqsg
I didn't say there wasn't a way. U can try GEM ambassador but to qualify it is recommended you take LK5001 and LK5002. In addition u will also have to take BU5643 when u are on Exchange,btohqsg
That sounds cool except for one thing,btohqsg
Not that its hard but the amount of effort i had to put in was more than any effort i put into my core mods lmao,btohqsg
I mean u just have to do that and then u can pretty much get a Minor in Modern Languages as LK5001 and LK5002 done in NTU then u match LK5003 AND 5004 in Ewha and when u come back to NTU just take any Language Level 1 Mod and u are set.,btohqsg

Why u tag me?The only ball I play is lestins one,btohqsg
The only ball your dad plays isyour savings,btohqsg
In fields of green where children play Lestins balls bounce and sway.Bright and round  they soar so high Kissing clouds in the azure sky.They dance on winds with joyful cheer A symbol of fun  drawing near.Through laughter and the morning's light They bring delight from day to night.Colors vivid  spirits lift A simple toy  a precious gift.For in the bounce and gentle fall Lies the magic of Lestins balls.,btohqsg
Idk does he have 1 or 2?@iestin,btohqsg
but not all dinosaurs are birds,btohqsg
But is Matcha a bird or a dinosaur,btohqsg
but not all shades of green are birds,btohqsg
But 50 shades of grey dictate a movie.,btohqsg
because mammals and reptiles split earlier,btohqsg
Bro I think those are inflamed,btohqsg
but all reptiles are not birds,btohqsg
Does it include the ball in your mouth rn,btohqsg

it's legit that all birds are reptiles,btohqsg
actually are they considered dinosaurs now,btohqsg
no wonder whenever i see a specific species name of a bird  it sounds awfully like a dinosaur,btohqsg
I used to have a dinosaur phase,btohqsg
what do you call flying dinosaurs anyway,btohqsg
ok I kinda still have now but ykw,btohqsg
when I was younger I was obsessed with them for this short period of time,btohqsg
minh  this shows that you are one of a shit poster too,btohqsg
The only spit I want is for it to be in my face,btohqsg
easiest to hardest or hardest to easiest?,btohqsg
but there are flying dinosaurs that aren't birds,btohqsg
I have seen a chicken fly from tree to tree b4,btohqsg

The ostrich fly into your face,btohqsg
Emus won a war by just running,btohqsg

lol there's a crocodile that describes sg students,btohqsg
i remember there are different types of dinosaurs but i forgot what are the names specifically for the land  sky & sea,btohqsg
ngl if you think about it,btohqsg
but i usually consider things under umbrella terms,btohqsg
would yall consider ba kuh teh as pork even though the chinese name of the dish is something like dragon bones soup,btohqsg
So eggs are unborned dinosaur babies,btohqsg
do you think im a walking encyclopedia,btohqsg

No amount of debate skills will help if you're arguing with siaolangs,btohqsg
Tbh i dun think anything will work w my mum lmao,btohqsg
It is not abt argument skills,btohqsg
She can sometimes ask me a qns when she just expect 1 answer‚Ä¶then if i dun say that answer  she gets angry,btohqsg
I get angry can I expect 1 answer pls?,btohqsg
no but i used to read up on a lot of things through magazines and newspapers before they slowly phased out,btohqsg
that's how i also got to know the largest marine reef in singapore is in sisters' island,btohqsg
Young Scientist was my goto comic when I was a kid on the toliet,btohqsg
the whole debate over various murals in singapore is so ridiculous,btohqsg
which part of the game aeroplane chess gives people the reference of warfare?,btohqsg

Funny thing was my dad say ‚Äòok actually we are not planning to take sq‚Äô  then my mum say ‚Äòno not true‚Äô ‚Äî she was actually planning to take sq,btohqsg
