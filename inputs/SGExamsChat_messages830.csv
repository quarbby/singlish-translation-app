idk why their intern quality is like so low standards now,btohqsg
I mean not enough ppl care lorh,btohqsg
their news coverage also got some bias also,btohqsg
applies to most news outlet tbh,btohqsg
does this mean need bring laptop,btohqsg
sg foreign policy and sg news outlet v diff,btohqsg
this looks like NTU comms or adm interview,btohqsg
just make sure its viewable after sharing the link,btohqsg
not unless you got projects like codes  or hard designs to show,btohqsg
this will choose if my future continues in ite or poly,btohqsg
you'll be shocked to know that sg is still quite bias,btohqsg
to those countries which support heavily financially or give vv good resources to sg,btohqsg
Why u gotta attack CoHASS like dat,btohqsg
Cus Comms and ADM too special alr.,btohqsg

unless you damn fluent liddat best to revise what to say for this kind of thing,btohqsg
what does it mean when a xmm keeps looking at me and giggling,btohqsg
dosen't state media represent foreign policy?,btohqsg
So the issue is we have a shortage of livers for transplant.So to fix it we just need to harvest more livers. Make it so that 1 person would be able to donate mutiple livers and accept livers freely without question for transplantation.,btohqsg
for poly course transfer  do they look at sem 1 results or o level cut off point,btohqsg

eh strange sia  more likely ur acc got hacked and sent those sus msgs to those grps den kena ban,btohqsg
no i was part of the few people hating on the frequently seen porn bots last i remember,btohqsg
unlucky lor admin think ur annoying,btohqsg
i probably hate as much as u dw,btohqsg
even PSQ chat admins are not as sensitive as them,btohqsg
j that we cant do anyt so bobian,btohqsg
THEY HAVE LITERAL ADULTS posting (partial) nudes/porn on their telegram profile,btohqsg
that hold REPUTABLE positions in their jobs or wtv,btohqsg
yeah most of that are bots i understand,btohqsg
im mainly talking about the one person named Jermaine,btohqsg
she keep trash talking other members that post porn/porn bots,btohqsg
but she used to be one of them,btohqsg
I GOT FRICKIN etched in my mind,btohqsg
idk i saw she removed the nsfw related ones,btohqsg
coz that time she got flamed,btohqsg
AHAHAH i wanted to see that,btohqsg
i think i roasted too many of sgfollowsall active members,btohqsg
to the point one of them reported me and admins unilaterally banned me,btohqsg
imagine by doing so i get banned from the channel,btohqsg
im not banned from their channel but their informal chat,btohqsg
Neither am I  I'm only banned in their formal chats,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHAHA for what reason did you get banned then,btohqsg
Cause I told ppl if they wanted to see a pic of tharman with epstein,btohqsg
Not only I got banned  my acc got reported...I can't chat in any grp discussion for a week,btohqsg
idk whether to feel bad for you or laugh at the irony,btohqsg
The pic was in a news article from another country,btohqsg
Is it a good idea to up pes,btohqsg
if you know you can do better/improve/want to go further  why not,btohqsg
People who object something bout you,btohqsg
is it coz im a girl commenting on PES(NS stuff),btohqsg
might as well ask in a gc for boys -only!!,btohqsg
No I meant that is the meaning of naysayers,btohqsg
Naysayers is not even a gender term or army term dw  it's a general term,btohqsg
most asian kids relate to this,btohqsg
should've slept or took bus instead,btohqsg
Tbh I think Singapore in general is due for some cleansing,btohqsg
First start with u then me,btohqsg
i already did some deep soul cleansing,btohqsg
Yes but in the typical singapore sinkie fashion you go first so I can see you die,btohqsg
now im finding my bus stop to go PSSSSHHH,btohqsg
If I am gonna die I prefer to see someone die first,btohqsg
these drivers need to be shamed,btohqsg
why are they parking near bus stop/taxi stands,btohqsg
fuck this im going to walk,btohqsg
THIS IS WHY SG NO MORE GD LEADERS!,btohqsg
No is just I need to be sure it actually kills someone first.,btohqsg
Then u go be leader la. U be leader by going ahead and be first,btohqsg
i will get bodyguards if im famous,btohqsg
U earn the bodyguards through acts of bravery/courage/stupidity like being first. So go ahead,btohqsg
Be first and earn your bodyguards.,btohqsg
Hello guys  just a quick survey( 1 question). PythonIs anyone here keen to learn programming ? (Even if you are not in CS or smth),btohqsg
Just doing some survey to gauge  how many people want,btohqsg
im interested depending on whatever is taught ig,btohqsg
i learnt basic python programming but i wanna go through the pain again,btohqsg
What can repeat exact word for word wat u say,btohqsg
liver transplants are expensive but the government in singapore provides schemes and subsidies for those with financial difficulties,btohqsg
i wanna know what happened bef she said that,btohqsg
but what lead to her saying that,btohqsg
probably related to the questions of the course she's being interviewed for,btohqsg
I don't remember biomed sci needing to know that,btohqsg
i think she was referencing a scenario oni,btohqsg
But still tho if the interviewer cringe then like context matters so,btohqsg
maybe out of context or incorrect knowledge,btohqsg
I only know gov subsidise  50% of surgery so,btohqsg
some is the way the interviewer hears how the interviewee describes,btohqsg
then anymore is either medifund or social,btohqsg
Maybe she left it very vague,btohqsg
Need know context first bef i can say anything tho,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzS5rPaZW9w&pp=ygUhc3RhbmQgdXAgZm9yIHNpbmdhcG9yZSBwcm9kdWN0aW9uis it just me  or do you also hear a certain... synth quality to some parts of this song?,btohqsg
last time the quality for synthetic music isn't as smooth as it is today,btohqsg
I wonder what synth(s) they used...,btohqsg
actually nursing  biomed  pharmaceutical sci courses will be given scenario based qns,btohqsg
y‚Äôall how to know if u got rejected for eae,btohqsg
rp js released their results tdy but i didn‚Äôt receive anyt,btohqsg
it depends on which sch u apply to,btohqsg
i finished my np one alr,btohqsg
i got my results from sp n np except rp,btohqsg
u apply to which curse ?,btohqsg
Rp rarely rejects...it's just the admins fkin slow,btohqsg
i saw the eae gc one person receive liao,btohqsg
Anything to do with administration side  they are literally sloths,btohqsg
But maybe   cause science I think it's their hardest school to get in,btohqsg
biomed and nursing modules are stressful,btohqsg
so if i don‚Äôt receive anyt,btohqsg
cuz idk how the email is being sent,btohqsg
I don't know tbh for rp  wait ah I ask someone,btohqsg
n rp sent theirs at odd timing,btohqsg
Ye..the admins always funny funny one,btohqsg
It took me 2 months to get my student card üòÇ,btohqsg
@ItzMeReaayou can answer this I think,btohqsg
Prepare the rope to go hang yourself in,btohqsg
No. BMS is hell bruh. Also if it's RP Aliza is probably taking her own sweet time doing sweet fa.,btohqsg
Not worth the amount of hair I lost from stress,btohqsg
Ouch  anyways thanks for the sticker pack,btohqsg
Nah bro I'm one sem away,btohqsg
so if tdy i nvr receive anyt is rej liao ?,btohqsg
i mean not the end of the world,btohqsg
even if others received already  doesn't mean you will receive results of your eae application,btohqsg
plus usually for EAE they'll send out both successfully and rejected emails,btohqsg
coz just template generated  just different courses/schools/poly/system,btohqsg
Biomed is for those wannabes who think they can be in 5 in 150,btohqsg
reals i have to wait for sem 1 or next year to change course,btohqsg
Bruh it's like not related to medicine at all imo üòê,btohqsg
It's basically just bio research and testing methodologies,btohqsg
idk i js dk how i can be accepted from sp n np but rej from rp üò≠,btohqsg
anyway i will js wait it out,btohqsg
honestly js go rp if cmi,btohqsg
you have many other options out there girlie,btohqsg
idw to stay in ite anym üò≠,btohqsg
Is like the most low stakes thing ever,btohqsg
do uk who u are up against in eae?,btohqsg
Conditional offer also doesn't guarantee too lmao,btohqsg
Coming from a person who got their offer revoked,btohqsg
Give me a profile of someone applying for eae then,btohqsg
If u fail the Minimum Entry Requirements your offer will be revoked,btohqsg
I declined mine cause i wanted another course,btohqsg
most r sec sch students who hav like shown their interest in the course via projects etc n prob excel in the subjects related to the course,btohqsg
isn‚Äôt it js like 26 points?,btohqsg
do uk who i was up against in my eae?,btohqsg
Which in this case is less than 26 pts and pass C6 Maths Science +D7 English,btohqsg
Diff course also got diff minimum,btohqsg
As I said. EAE is the most low stakes shit ever,btohqsg
Btw if u think this then u arent ready for eae,btohqsg
i lowkey felt i shld hav applied for a less competitive course,btohqsg
Im not throwing shit at u but like serious,btohqsg
u stood no chance if that's all u got,btohqsg
Limpeh do before it's legit nothing lmao,btohqsg
eh that one o level what,btohqsg
Olevel ITE it's the same shit bruh u do the same test and interviews etc.,btohqsg
your mentality needs to be adjusted,btohqsg
It's just a different qualification point,btohqsg
In my interview right the other 3 people were student council presidents  have their own successful biz that is already making 10k/mth and are already helping out in community,btohqsg
i o lvl still going ite,btohqsg
this is who u are up against,btohqsg
u are literally up against elites,btohqsg
ask them stfu and say fun act so big fk,btohqsg
N level EAE requirements is different from O level standards,btohqsg
My interview also but in the end they pick me,btohqsg
Just enter using your results can liao ITE is legit no competition for entry one u hit the requirements u will get in,btohqsg
If u don't hit the requirements even EAE also cannot help u,btohqsg
Imagine needing a failsafe for N levels,btohqsg
Honestly right the interview was actually cutting it close so i think they chose the one with most stacked portfolio,btohqsg
but got alot of weird ppl at ite eae,btohqsg
Which brings me back to my point EAE is the most lowstakes shit ever,btohqsg
make me want drop put ho private,btohqsg
Hearsay those joker mostly Nursing one,btohqsg
The EAE for nursing is damn competitive,btohqsg
Cause pay is decent after grad kek,btohqsg
js go thr act arrogant like u achieve alot can alr,btohqsg
"No la is cuz those ppl legit got ""passion"" for nursing",btohqsg
The JAE intake is for those who fucked up Olevels,btohqsg
then fuck YOUR PASSION bro what is this guy on,btohqsg
Smlj u got see nursing pay before?,btohqsg
but i feel like if uw go nursing  it's better to go jc then do alvls,btohqsg
Wah that girl gone liao we scared her off,btohqsg
cause u have higher chance of getting into nus nursing,btohqsg
and bachelor of nursing pays higher than dip,btohqsg
Depends. But most cases actually dun need,btohqsg
Bachelor allows for Advanced Practice Nurse Progression but it's too specialised,btohqsg
E120 how much u think nursing pays,btohqsg
nus nursing not that competitive act,btohqsg
What we need are regular RNs and ENs,btohqsg
matcha not everyone can get into JC with whatever life experiences considered by the norm,btohqsg
Which the Diploma churns out and pays decent if u hop around,btohqsg
E120 can give me money? I dont wanna work anymore,btohqsg
it's not rlly an eltist mindset,btohqsg
Smlj u buy aespa ticket from scalper u still wanna ask me for money. I still haven't ask you for aespa ticket yet kns,btohqsg
but no one can already survive through their Residency years to become a RN these days,btohqsg
RN EN once u get full registration basically just leave MOH become freelancer,btohqsg
depends on the situation but yea a lvl cert can get you nearly everywhere,btohqsg
Then hop around gigs like blood draw etc,btohqsg
Ive spent the last of my money to get that,btohqsg
I mean for that specific degree,btohqsg
I dont have a single cent left i can give to you,btohqsg
Very good. Now give me your ticket bitch,btohqsg
Actually right why she aiming for bms,btohqsg
Bms only top 1% get into med tho,btohqsg
And if u that 1% u probably can make it in jc,btohqsg
Applied sciences or health science course lor,btohqsg
How about you give me your butt,btohqsg
if u cannot make it to jc or make it in jc what makes u think u can make it in medical school,btohqsg
Dk like you being delulu let others be delulu,btohqsg
LOL maybe coz of life choices,btohqsg
I just show ppl where to find the rope if they wanna hang themselves its up to them.,btohqsg

i got one at mt faber  sentosa and like others,btohqsg
