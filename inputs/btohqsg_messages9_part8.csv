Applications then maybe possible  since queenstown has 610 units but telok blangah only 170,btohqsg
It should be the hottest one in the next launch ba. That's why for the bro above who has an appointment for yishun sales of balance  I not sure why he's considering risking his selection for the next bto,btohqsg
If can select flat  just go for that le.,btohqsg
Any idea if elderly singles will also have to pay additional 15k for 2 room flats?,btohqsg
Anyone acquired tengah bto during May 2019? Anyone know if it will delay for a year due to covid?,btohqsg
Short lease pay 15k like not worth sia. For non mature estate that's more than 10% of flat price,btohqsg
that's like my mum would be paying $333/mth for 30 years,btohqsg
My relative selecting flat this fri  she just realised need to pay 15k more,btohqsg
The flat only 166k for 99 year lease  so 15k is a lot,btohqsg
I thought maybe short lease won't need to pay 15k,btohqsg
regardless shortlease  singles have to pay $15k for 2r flexi,btohqsg
see does this applies to your relative,btohqsg
anyway  grant amount will be shared between both sole applicants,btohqsg
Ok thanks  I think she first timer,btohqsg
she never bought new subsidised flat from HDB before?,btohqsg
Grant given only to a maximum of 2 applicants who are husband and wife  and who are also the current owners of the 2-room subsidised flat,btohqsg
Nvr  so only can get EHG,btohqsg
Anybody have an idea how to change the scheme/ personal info in the SBF application status?,btohqsg
I'm 99% sure (from memory) you login  go to MyHDB > Applications > New Flat  then click on your application number and scroll to the bottom have option to make changes to your application.,btohqsg
Hi everyone  just a quick question: Do I need to amend Family nucleus in my HDB portal because I've just delivered a baby?,btohqsg
then if no need  what's the status of the baby in the household?,btohqsg
I feel like if baby is occupant just update anyway,btohqsg
To be very honest  I don't remember hahahahahahaha. I wasn't pregnant when I applied for my sbf  but I already had 2 kids then.,btohqsg
Okay I went to re-read everything on the PPS. Yes I think I'm under that scheme because I have kids. So I'm gonna just include my #3's name as occupant just in case,btohqsg
no harm doing that just need some of your time,btohqsg
You're right! Imma do it tonight. Thank you all for your inputs!,btohqsg
If i alr have a house  can i still bto and stay in my current house while waiting for bto to be completed ?,btohqsg
You will be applying as 2nd timerIf you are the owner of a HDB and have yet to complete MOP  must either appeal or wait for 5yr MOP to be up before applying.If you own private property  must dispose and wait 30 months before applying.If you own HDB that's already MOP  can just apply as second timer.,btohqsg
Didn't know can purchase resale without grant  those passed down units I understand.,btohqsg
if@wwwww1261never received any grant or subsidy then he's still a first timer,btohqsg
I will be applying as a second timer BUT i want to apply for a new bto and not sell my current flat before i get my new bto . Isit possible ?,btohqsg
Im willing to sell maybe a few months before my new bto come,btohqsg
Just want to know if i need to sell the current flat before i can apply for a new bto,btohqsg
Your current flat reach MOP alr right?,btohqsg
Not yet but lets say if reach already then sell,btohqsg
why not as long as your CPFOA has sufficient fund for the downpayment of your BTO,btohqsg
After reach then can apply. Don't need to sell yet,btohqsg
ideal time to sell is when you get your keys,btohqsg
Sell within 6 months after BTO key collection,btohqsg
But to apply when you still within MOP then must write in to appeal,btohqsg
what's your budget for the next housing?,btohqsg
when you get the keys you must have sufficient fund for the remaining payment for your new house,btohqsg
the time lapse of letter for key collection varies I think,btohqsg
some one week in advance  some few months,btohqsg
Idk the budget yet . Because my current house is still as single   i want to get married and upgrade my house . So will be 2 income together,btohqsg
As long as i have enough for downpayment ok alr right ? ü§î,btohqsg
Okay great thank you guys üòçüòçüòçüòç,btohqsg
2nd part is getting keys because you probably haven't sold your house yet  if you managed to save so much then no issue,btohqsg
or doing a contra with HDB,btohqsg
Hmm i will still be eligible for a loan right ? ü§î,btohqsg
