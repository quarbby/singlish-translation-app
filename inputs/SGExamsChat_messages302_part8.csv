All the best everyone for As tomorrow!,btohqsg

Why dw take h2 math? Scared ah?,btohqsg
I understand. Without A math H2 math is damn tough,btohqsg
But still can make it right?,btohqsg
No I don't have a strong emath foundation,btohqsg
The thing is For those who take A math,btohqsg
Will also find H2 math a struggle.,btohqsg
Must i do damn well for H2 math to do H3 math,btohqsg
If u can manage h2 math then why not.,btohqsg
U must do well for all subjects,btohqsg
Then do you know the difference H1 math and H2 math@Onetrickcore,btohqsg
For h1 and h2It is divided into 2 section.Pure math and stats.,btohqsg
Stats for h1 and h2 is the similar.,btohqsg
But h1 math pure math is like 20 to 30 % of A math syllabus,btohqsg
And for h1 math u are only will be seating for 1 paper.,btohqsg
And h2 math will have to sit for 2 paper. Which is 3 hours each also,btohqsg
So h1 math will only have paper 1,btohqsg
what course uw go in uni@Onetrickcorejust curious,btohqsg
The main difference isH1 mathPure math is 40%Stats 60%WhereasH2 mathPure math is 70%Stats 30%,btohqsg
Something related to business or accounting,btohqsg
Then h1 is suitable for you alr.,btohqsg

Ik q alot ppl east side go mi,btohqsg
Local uni econs no need H2 math as prerequisite. But still if you have a uni course in mind  make sure you meet the prerequisites for the course. Not having H2 math eliminates most STEM-related courses,btohqsg
I didn’t realise I disliked economics so much until I actually studied it,btohqsg
Doesnt international business have alot of econs?,btohqsg
We don’t specialise in that content until year 2,btohqsg
But the econs module that I studied so far was soooo dry,btohqsg
Even though the lecturer was lit,btohqsg
R u gonna go for business admin degree?,btohqsg
I kinda realised I liked computer science,btohqsg
So I’m planning to self study it,btohqsg
Maybe take H2 math privately or something,btohqsg
Lol im the complete opposite. I realised i hate coding and prefer business,btohqsg
Yea exactly i am a mob,btohqsg
It’s the product that you create with it,btohqsg
