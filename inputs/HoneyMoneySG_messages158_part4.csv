Hi there  take a look at this stock:United SGD Fund(SG9999001382)2.1322  Fall-0.02%Access real-time quotes on moomoo 👇🏻Ride The Markethttps://www.moomoo.com/stock/18000837-MF?from=share&stockId=18000837,btohqsg

I am looking for confirmation that ipaymy works for UOB Prvi miles card based on Seth post (https://sethisfy.com/guide-using-ipaymy-or-cardup-for-paying-bills-and-earning-card-rewards/amp/) despite the T&C state that it’s an exclusion,btohqsg
U want to trust a finfluencer over bank's t&c  up to u man. Bank is the one giving the miles 🤷🏻‍♂️In all seriousness  it's Seth's post u can ask him directly on his own telegram grp hahah,btohqsg
If the bank tnc state that is not possible then it is not possible. It is the bank prerogative and not Seth to decide on this. Now I can understand why many people panic over the Choco finance just based on a few videos 😉,btohqsg
Hi  about paying Citi cc bill  does it count as paying on time if you made the payment before due date but it cant necessarily be posted on time (e.g. not processed over weekend) ?,btohqsg
Use fast to make sure your payment is immediate,btohqsg
The credit card company won’t know your payment is “on the way”  you may be subject to late charges. My view,btohqsg
If I see my amount paid in the list of citi transaction  but it is still pending  is it ok?,btohqsg
Really depends on what Citi records as your payment date. What method did u use to pay?,btohqsg
Got get the message thank you for your payment?,btohqsg
Had a glimpse at his article and he didn't explicitly say prvi will earn from ipaymy.,btohqsg
I just used DBS’ transfer to other bank’s card function  not sure if it’s under FAST,btohqsg
Yeah my bad for assuming that,btohqsg
I used uob priv visa with iPayMy. It works,btohqsg
If fast in. Will get thank you message immediately. But status seen in Citi app is pending. But can see immediately.,btohqsg
Seems like they circumvent it by changing its descriptors.,btohqsg
Ya so proceed with caution. You don't have any ground to appeal if you don't earn rewards later on,btohqsg
Hi  has anyone used Heymax to pay for Shopee? How long does it take for the max miles to appear in ur account? Does it show pending first? Or usually nth at all.,btohqsg
Yes. If you do correctly  it will take 1 full day to track. It will be pending for a while then change to confirmed later.,btohqsg
Hello  may I clarify if Card Up / iPayMy transactions are excluded from DBS Credit cards?And would you think these transactions could be used for the DBS welcome bonus as well?,btohqsg
get base points. welcome bonus depends on TnC,btohqsg
Not certain about this coz Kris+ transactions don’t count toward the SIA group spend. Your best guess might be to ask UOB but doubtful they will give u a clear answer.My take is it won’t count toward the. $800 spend,btohqsg
Hi  is eGiro link to bank account on GXS feature unavailable?,btohqsg
Seems that it’s not available. I previously tried a few times. Not able to set up,btohqsg
What’s the best option to pay school fees  insurance premiums  tax etc and earn miles / rewards,btohqsg

In more news  their custodian bank is not hsbc or state street which was what they said  but allfunds,btohqsg
Sure  any other options for over $1k?,btohqsg

So transaction above $1k will be declined?,btohqsg
Hi guys  regarding the Amaze nerf  if for low spending (<$50)  no minumum spend  and contactless  is chocolate card the next best option?,btohqsg
What would be the next option? 😅,btohqsg
PPV? But honestly <$50 spending a month not worth having a miles card for that option unless you have pooling  as you have high risk of orphan milesPersonally I would just go with a cashback card like DCS Platinum MC or Maribank CC,btohqsg
Oh i meant below 50 per transaction  but spending of below 1k a month,btohqsg
unless your transactions are all v small < $5 per transaction then not worth it,btohqsg
Anyone can summaries the chocolate saga?The previously unlimited miles is 2mpd as heymax miles?,btohqsg
Hi Guys  for UOB Visa Signature card u need to spend $1000 per month on FCY. If I didn't meet the FCY spending  will I still enjoy the 4 mpd for the $1000 local spend?,btohqsg

2mpd up to 1k per calendar month.,btohqsg
