okok i will take note of this,btohqsg
i was worried owner take money n drive away LOL,btohqsg
It is always transfer on the day itself. Usually Payment to dealer then they will transfer to you on the spot,btohqsg
Ask before you buy  if they say transfer after certain # of days  just walk away find another dealer,btohqsg
Doubt they accept cashier order. All will ask for paynow. So payment is immediate,btohqsg
is direct sale though so i wil bring it up with the seller,btohqsg
See dealer. Some dealers dont trf until bank loan disburses,btohqsg
Lol dun believe the cashier order shit🤣 all paynow one. Buyer scared seller run  seller scared buyer run too. If seller say transfer have up to 7 days and he can't do on the spot for whatever reasons  you should tell him then when he can transfer ownership  you will pay. When he transfer  you will receive notification on the spot too. No delay one.,btohqsg
Buy from AD safest.Wont kena game,btohqsg
