I wanna earn miles. Any card recommend to use cardup website to pay,btohqsg
Use general spend card  uob prvi  etc.,btohqsg
Cardup doesnt earn bonus points for specialized card. Re: hsbc revo,btohqsg
If I sign up credit card using singsaver  then use cardup to pay for renovation. Will I entitle for the singsaver promo?,btohqsg
Ah really? My wife ZYM now totally no network in Shanghai.,btohqsg
You are guy. Put lady pict right,btohqsg
That's a whole other problem then haha,btohqsg
Do you guys think I should cancel my HSBC Revolution? Cannot find any use case for it.,btohqsg
Why cancel? It’s a zero annual fee card with no min spending. Can just choose to just add it to your mobile wallet and don’t bring outUnless you say after the cool down period then you want to apply for another hsbc card for the rewards then probably yes,btohqsg
I scared the MCC rules keep getting reduced... =(Now  tbh  I rarely use this card now.,btohqsg
Nerfs are always gonna happen  it’s a matter of when only. If you have other cards enough to cover the mcc and your spending can be covered by those cards max cap then can cancel. Imo  doesn’t hurt to keep the card since no fees or min spending to maintain it,btohqsg
I'm keeping my HSBC Revo for grab rides  flight and shopee/lazada. If you want to cancel then 1y apply new to bank  that works too.,btohqsg
Yeah I agree  just keep the card.Sometimes will have some spare uses for it.And after all no AF.,btohqsg
Yes. I am thinking of the 1y apply new to bank,btohqsg
Because this is the card for restaurants,btohqsg
That concept I applies to scb,btohqsg
Maybe OP has UOB lady’s card for restaurant?,btohqsg
I have multiple HSBC Entertainer from each HSBC cards.HSBC PMC = Entertainer PremiumHSBC Revo = Entertainer StandardUsed to be very useful for Venchi stack with AMEX 10x  and Hoshino Coffee which my son likes.,btohqsg
A bit Jiak bah liao  just like nerfs  boost also sometimes can happen also.But then your personal choice,btohqsg
Have some risk of being small brokerage. And platform really lousy. Need to use other platform to research and charting.And take note they make money through other way such as charging high fee for transferring funds out etc. And many different charges.Data lags.Do take note my info is out of date. Used it many many years ago. Have change since. Better to refer to their own website.,btohqsg
Yes and atome too. My spending can hit 1k cap of crmc easily so hsbc revo is useful to help absorb some expenses. To each other own spending.,btohqsg
Does auto atome bill give bonus pts for revo? Or need to manual payment?,btohqsg
My experience is different  my code for atome is coded according to the merchant  not 5999.Not sure abt the rest,btohqsg
I see woman dbs card a matter of time bonus miles may down to 1k or 1100 follow citi rewards/hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Uob lady card bonus point will remain at 1k... this is fair enough,btohqsg
For Webull Moneymarket fund  if u activated SGD   u can't use USD ? only one or if I happen to convert some SGD to USD  I can have both running ?,btohqsg
Which merchant was it? A few times I checked it was 5999.,btohqsg
I always trigger it manually at the start of the month so I can't comment. Some data point on crmc not recognizing atome auto deduct as online so I don't wanna risk it.,btohqsg
For watever reason  now SCB keeps rejecting my application even with high credit rating,btohqsg
Despite having some reserve USD ( Exchanged ) it somehow doesn't subscribe into the USD one   I know that I cam RSP manually but that doesn't count toward purchasing power and can't redeemed automatically when u wanna buy some stocks,btohqsg
maybe i keep applying and closing previously some savings accs for the newbie offers.,btohqsg
Why you open saving and close scb,btohqsg
You should just keep there. Like the bros say here open hsbc Ega account. In my opinion . Should keep there. Don't remove fund off unnecessary,btohqsg
On this subject  if I have posb everyday credit card at the moment   am I new to DBS credit card?,btohqsg
Refreshment of funds in between accs,btohqsg
I will cancel this card soon. Already found replacement,btohqsg
Anyone has issue with Amaze card on Google pay?,btohqsg
"Mine was suddenly ""removed"" from my Google pay. I can't add it back.  It says card not supported.",btohqsg
Did you apply for another bank's card recently?,btohqsg
"There is this ""2% interest rate subsidy yield coupon"" from Moomoo.  Does anyone know what it is and how to use?  Thks",btohqsg
Maybe you can read the tnc of the coupon?,btohqsg
Why though? This is one of the easiest and most versatile 4MPD Card. You only need another secondary card to handle online purchases.,btohqsg
Hi how scb calculate within 30days? On 2may i transfer out 20k. Tnc say cannot transfer in within 30 days. I made incoming on 1jun 50k. Is it within 30days? This is for esaver acc.,btohqsg
Hey bros  anyone knows if uob one account auto close after 3 consecutive months with zero balance?,btohqsg
Have read abd not clear to me.  I will ask Cs then.,btohqsg
Do they calculate daily average ?,btohqsg
Yes...my reason same as chris... always need to spend my than 5$ then get rewarded 4 miles,btohqsg
My replacement for this card is citi rewards master,btohqsg
That makes sense then! Citi Rewards+Amaze will cover everything that UOB PPV can do. As long as the 1k per month limit is sufficient for you.,btohqsg
Usually I don't spend much on citi rewards. Because I still have ocbc rewards.. I spend it on supermarket   guardian and watson,btohqsg
