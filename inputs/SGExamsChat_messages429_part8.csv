Japanese consumption tax (JCT) is similar to European Value Added Tax in many respects. It applies at 10% on domestic sales of goods and services as well as upon importation into Japan. There is also a reduced 8% applicable to certain food products and beverages. In addition  some transactions such as export transactions are exempt from JCT.https://www.ey.com/en_gl/tax-alerts/japan-s-consumption-tax-reform-will-be-effective-from-1-october-2023-implementation-considerations,btohqsg
