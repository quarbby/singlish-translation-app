Why r yall taking sides this is so funny for 0 reason,btohqsg
i know there is a another convo but keep in mind  this is one weapon the US has that Russia does not. Its a missle that contains no explosives but instead acts like a blending machine..where the moment it strikes  blades of steel will potrude and cut anything in its way to pieces..including human flesh and bones,btohqsg
i think this entire chat knows you are banned from the discord,btohqsg
But no one who is having mental health issues will be openly announcing it bruh  it is so fake,btohqsg
thats why i acknowledged there's another convo,btohqsg
i mean it's not about taking sides,btohqsg
I think it depends but I don't want to pass judgement on other people,btohqsg
Yall hating on each other is so funny,btohqsg
the demographic between the two platforms is just very different,btohqsg
Like the stats also showing a significant portion not opening to people / seeking professional help,btohqsg
How does this affect lebron legacy,btohqsg
Everyone treat it damn diff la,btohqsg
i tried talking to the discord and couldn't last 48 hours,btohqsg
half their chat time was spamming copypasta lol,btohqsg
I was gonna leave and stayed because of you then you left ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡,btohqsg
i just dun like using tele cuz its a constant keep on going thing n u cant rly backread,btohqsg
ok but when i say demographic i mean like,btohqsg
the perspective people have on things is v diff,btohqsg
I dun even hv a discord account  not planning to have one,btohqsg
Tele is like whatsapp chat but with blue theme,btohqsg
My brother is addicted to it,btohqsg
i have several accs..all pretty much used for twitch,btohqsg
i just like things being stored on a cloud,btohqsg
I created tele coz in uni everything is on tele lolâ€¦no more old fashion WhatsApp,btohqsg
i only use tele for my tele channel n for when ppl text me on tele,btohqsg
but i dont rly use tele cuz my mom uses my tele acc too,btohqsg
tele is nice so people don't need to know my number,btohqsg
Why is my prof posting something at 11.51pm,btohqsg
no leh i feel like tele more old ppl than young ppl,btohqsg
also this is exactly why people come on tele  get shit on then go discord to vent about how shit tele is,btohqsg
Iâ€™m actually lazy to go between tell and WhatsApp,btohqsg
i still use whatsapp for dominant comms,btohqsg
tele people are annoyed with how stupid discord people are,btohqsg
WhatsApp I just use it for sch stuff nowadays,btohqsg
My aunt created tele in hope that I will reply her faster lol,btohqsg
Now uni official or not is all tele,btohqsg
Theres a lot of old ppl on disc tho?,btohqsg
only person i text on whatsapp is my professor,btohqsg
Damn. But I hope it will never be used. Our generation hasnâ€™t experienced a war in very long time and some have said we have grown soft as a result. And as time passes it feels like world leaders are forgetting about the lessons that we should have learnt from ww2.,btohqsg
Idk most of my older friends come from disc,btohqsg
There was a point in time where I keep on being added to spam groups so I went to off privacyâ€¦,btohqsg
There was this idiot who spam call + WhatsApp me,btohqsg
Everything hard and fast proof there,btohqsg
ive been in both worlds..spent quite a few hundred hrs on each alr..overtime  you will just become someone that doesn't follow anybody's rules..irregardless of the platform,btohqsg
Anyway i'm wondering what will happen if neko luna finds out the stuff that floral said about her,btohqsg
Eventually if they find out she talks out of both sides of her mouth  sheâ€™s gonna be very isolated,btohqsg
She already know I am not stupid but keep calling and spamming messages for more than a month before she recently gave up getting me,btohqsg
this is absolutely unrelated to anything i'm saying,btohqsg
I still dk who is florals,btohqsg
J1 from yijc alw calling herself dumb,btohqsg
