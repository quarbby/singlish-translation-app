🚀Pika World Weekend Edition- 13 May 2023🚀💵We have hit a resistance point🔫The equity market continued its second consecutive week of decline as investors were triggered by the souring of consumer sentiment and the prolonged wrangling on the debt ceiling.For the week  we saw the Dow tumble 1.1%. S&P 500 gave up 0.3% for the week  and Nasdaq dived 0.4%.💳Consumers feeling the pressure from a weaker macroeconomic environment🍱As we have seen  The University of Michigan’s preliminary sentiment index fell to 57.7  a 9% drop from the previous month. As we begin 2023  we have seen consumer sentiment showing a high level of resilience on the back of a strong labour market as the index hovered above 60.Now  we are approached with news of a possible recession  and the politicians in Washington are still debating on the debt ceiling drama. This certainly imprinted a dismal view by consumers.🧃Inflation expectation is moderating⏳The expectation for inflation is making good progress. We are seeing a decline from 4.6% to 4.5%. However  long-term expectations climbed from 3% to 3.2%. It comes against weaker CPI and PPI data received during the week.🩺Our assessment of the general market🔦We do not see today’s market turn out as a sell-off. Instead  it hints at a long-standing trend of the S&P 500 being unable to reach the 4200 mark  where sellers tend to swarm in to push the indices down.A fresh wave of earnings can propel the index higher as new economic data  such as retail sales and building permits  set the tone for the week. We shall see.With that  we wish you a fruitful weekend. Stay hydrated and enjoy the well-deserved break.Your lovely trading buddy Pika Nat.,btohqsg
