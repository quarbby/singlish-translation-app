Hi i got this serious question hope the learned shifu here can help to answer.My mother in law is born in 1958 while my mother is born in 1959.My mother in law had 77k in her RA at 55 and the 77k was straightaway transferred to cpf life when she was 55. she decided to start drawing her cpf life this year at 66yo. while at cpf appointment last week we were told that she can get 680 per month under standard plan and the capital of 77k will be exhausted in 9yrs. the cpf staff said that once money went into cpf life the interest is no longer yours so the capital that will be pass to beneficiary is based on 77k. i use cpf life estimator to see calculate and in order to get 680 per month the capital should be abt 120k. i compound 77k for 11yrs at 4% and i get abt 120k as well.my mother who turns 65 this year started her cpf life this year as well. she had 93k in her RA at 65 and is drawing 520 per month. her 93k in RA only go into cpf life this year when she started her cpf life payout. her 93k will only be exhausted after 15yrs.i realised my mother in law is being shortchanged because the money in her RA was transferred to cpf life at 55 while my mother is able to keep her RA money until 65 earning 10 yrs of interest. this resulted to a bigger capital which will only be depleted in 15 yrs instead of 9 yrs. the difference will come in if my mother pass on early as the money that will be inherited by her children including my wife will be lesser.may i know why is there such a disparity between people born in 1958 compared to ppl born one year later in 1959 pls?Thank you.,btohqsg
I think for both mother in law and mother.The CPF life interest no longer belongs to either of them. It will go to the common CPF pool upon their demise.Both mother and mother in law remaining principal sum will go to beneficiaries upon their demise.,btohqsg
I‚Äôll have a training conducted by US IT company for less than USD 3k  I check with heymax the mcc is 7399 or 5734.Since this will be in USD  will you suggest to use uob vs? I don‚Äôt think uob KF will cover that mcc. Or any other miles card will good for this situation,btohqsg
Check maybank horizon visa sig. 2.8mpd for fcy uncapped.,btohqsg
Shortchanged is a weird way of putting it  but I also always feels that I got short changed by govt as well as I paid more tax but always not eligible for any rebates etc. in any case  the reason is quite simple - Policy/calculation changed. Following not target at you but 1) Anybody who has money left when they pass away basically overworked.  2) Nine out of ten instances where I‚Äôve seen inheritance left (by folks who worked their entire life) to working adults  it‚Äôs spent on holidays  luxury items that the person who passed away couldn‚Äôt bear  to spend on themselves.,btohqsg

I will swipe $1000 on CRMC  $2000 on UOB VS  $1100 on UOB PPV  and the rest on Vantage/PrviMiles/Prestige. For items $6k and below.I also used amex plat charge for my wife luxury goods because it‚Äôs covered by card insurance up to $10k per occurrence and $50k per year.,btohqsg
used to be simpler with Amaze + UOB KF  then amaze charge 1% above 1k haiz,btohqsg
Still worth it at 2mpd if you consider 1% = 1mpd.No other cards got so high mpd liao.,btohqsg

Great share! Quick question on point (2) regarding 2 trade transactions‚Ä¶ any minimum trade value? Any specific exchange to trade on eg. SGX or NYSE? Read the t&c but no clarity on the trades,btohqsg
Also Maybank is only FCY means I need to use European site and maybe get charged in other currency than SGD,btohqsg
Maybank can get 2.8mpd for airticket,btohqsg
Or use My DBS ALT using Vpn and European version of Lufthansa so I get 2.2 Mpd on foreign,btohqsg
Is therr min spend of 800 sgd/month to get that ?,btohqsg
Yes but i thought your ticket is already 5.3k?,btohqsg
2.8 mpd compare to 2.2 mpd,btohqsg
Aha so it count in that spending too,btohqsg
If book and posted in jun is 3.2 mpd due to limited time promo,btohqsg
