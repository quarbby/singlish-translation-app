Another OCBC 360 CNY promo: 4% for 100k-150k  so same EIR 4.05% (Salary + Save)/4.65%(Salary + Save + Spend) as 100k previously  now up  to 150k. Only for Jan/Feb. Good for low spending ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
"Oh no  just realized it might cause problem after Feb. Since the ""Save"" requires $500 increment every month  after Feb u will lose the interest of the extra 50k or the Save bonus for March if u transfer out the 50k... Tricky OCBC",btohqsg
nvm lor  waste 1 month but can reset,btohqsg
"Dealing with OCBC really need strategy especially their ""Save"" bonus in order to max the interest ðŸ˜‚",btohqsg
If got  every years have 4.65% this account better than Sg reit,btohqsg
Anyone applied for supplementary cars for uob one?can request for annual fee waiver too?,btohqsg
