Wah… the spam so fast deleted,btohqsg
Very fast deleted… I want to play with the spammer…,btohqsg
Curious how much these spammer actually earn?,btohqsg
Most likely is from some syndicate… the big boss behind are the big winners,btohqsg
By commission maybe so they spam and if someone click it. Baited. But if they are caught then too bad,btohqsg
Want to send the jobsdb website,btohqsg
Cause no death penalty on them so its ok de. Just send only.,btohqsg
What is the worst penalty for scammers? Fine and Jail?,btohqsg
Can anyone give an insight- I got into an accident and was fined in Aug 2021- Made an appeal back then- Was suspended for other stuff in Feb 2022- Now the appeal came back on Apr 2022 saying it was rejectedQuestion is whether the demerit point will count towards my now 0/12 points or will it be nullified since it happened before suspension,btohqsg
These are the bens that want to steal. Ben I know you’re reading this. You’re pariah,btohqsg
Freeze their accounts. Seize their monies and jail.,btohqsg
Check the Website for ur demerit points. I think unable to advise cause the demerits will be with u since u kena so yupps to get full pic of that better to log into the points system,btohqsg
Make our police and banks so busy lol.,btohqsg
Demerit points only last 2 years,btohqsg
Don’t be scared of demerit points. You only have to go back to school.,btohqsg
Be a responsible driver. Sometimes not ur fault but well. Drive safe =D,btohqsg
GamxiaHaven’t pay fine yet so can’t really see if it’s added into my demerit or not.I just feel that it’s not fair to add demerit into my now clean record seeing as they’re the one who dragged the appeal for months  after I passed my suspension.,btohqsg
Fine meaning its ur fault or?I abit confused.Maybe u can write in and check as well.,btohqsg
Both me and lorry driver got fine  did a discretionary right turn on orangeLorry driver was speeding going straight at around 80-90km/h  got T-Boned by him.So I got fined for careless driving while he got fined for reckless driving,btohqsg
I did write in twice tospf_tp_feedback@spf.gov.sg2-3 times to no avail.Called TP Hotline and they couldn’t provide me an answer  instead gave me 2 number for different departments to call.Called nonstop but no one picks up,btohqsg
Then u kena demerit points? Wa shag. eally Shag. Hope u are fine. Anyway regarding that i think wont go over ur clean records also. Better to check with them.,btohqsg
Can see these departments shaking legs.,btohqsg
Was hospitalised for 2 months due to slight fracture near spine. Couldn’t stand or drive properly for awhile.Hopefully that’s the case  thinking to just go down to TP HQ and ask instead.Appreciated the replies tho bud,btohqsg
Uh we have may 2 as holiday too?,btohqsg
May 1st sunday labor day. Next day monday auto ph,btohqsg
Just announce for announcing or really special?,btohqsg
Not sure about Malaysia holiday. For Singapore  as long as holiday falls on Sunday  the next day becomes a holiday,btohqsg
Maybe they don’t have this practice?,btohqsg
For Johor  our weekends are on Fridays and Saturdays. As such  (Sunday is a working day and) there is no automatic replacement holiday on Monday for Labour Day.,btohqsg
So it’s really a special holiday… just like if Monday and Wednesday are holidays for us  n govt suddenly announced that Tuesday is a special holiday,btohqsg
Not all company have this practice especially sat kind of PH,btohqsg
In SG wait long long HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
U go and appeal to them  make next Wednesday a public holiday… Malaysia got three days while we only got two,btohqsg
