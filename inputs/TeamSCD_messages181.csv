So nv go class or cca chalet and get wasted type before,btohqsg
Its a different world than what i remembered 😆,btohqsg

Ye he told me about the limit increase,btohqsg
Oh well smoking sucks anyway. Drinking is way more fun,btohqsg
u uncle alr thenlimit doesnt matter 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
gettint drunk like adding trash to a dumpster fire,btohqsg
Nah but u have to do it once so u know where it is,btohqsg
Planned drunk is ok. Unplanned drunk is no go,btohqsg
Ur liver is young and flawless,btohqsg
Thats what i will say 🤣,btohqsg
1 night or your whole life,btohqsg
This is like 30 minutes for gerard,btohqsg

but rio my area very hard find,btohqsg
if i want i need to go to hillion,btohqsg
eh when yr buy car is monthly payment one right,btohqsg
then like a month what are the costs looking like if i wanna own one,btohqsg
Of coz got wear n tears parts including tires,btohqsg
so on average how mucy u paying,btohqsg
Lolx..income less than 6k month pls tread with care😄,btohqsg
is ok then i think imma wait like another 6 7 years alr,btohqsg
cos coe now very high  so ur loan will be high oso,btohqsg
Instalment - 900Season parking - 0Fuel - 400Servicing - depends on youERP - 0Non season parking - 200Road tax - 900 for 6 months if i not wrongInsurance - 1.4k yearly but comprehensive and can go any workshop,btohqsg
Season parking mayb 100 home 100 officeFuel maybe 300Servicing depend on your carERP maybe 10-20Non season parking maybe 20Road tax depend on your carInsurance depend on your car,btohqsg
so on average monthly ard 1.5k to 2k,btohqsg
but my previous car was much cheaper la,btohqsg
road tax less then 1k a year,btohqsg
that time so cheap it was less then 4k depre,btohqsg
Instalment $350Season parking $250 (home and office)Fuel $230Servicing dependsERP $10Non season parking i lump it into season parkingRoad tax $55Insurance $100about 1k to 1.2k for me,btohqsg
35k to be exact for the 10 year coe car,btohqsg
See what car you wanna drive and how much DP you wanna put down,btohqsg
If you can DP alot  your monthly installment will be lower,btohqsg
Road tax and insurance varies too :D,btohqsg
overall will pay lower also right,btohqsg
just tryna get a rough picture on what to expect uk,btohqsg
Even for me  my ins is considered high because im enjoy 10% ncd only. If you have 50% thats more savings for you,btohqsg
new car monthly now oso need at least 1k,btohqsg
i thinking of old car tbh,btohqsg
even my shitty kia today will cost you a bomb,btohqsg
plus the high cost on sg now,btohqsg
invisible paper now cost 2-3times more den the car,btohqsg
If you are considering coe cars  you have to consider the wear and tear parts too. Road tax and ins are higher as well i think.,btohqsg
new cars don't really have manual so bo bian,btohqsg
exactly which is y i wan olf,btohqsg
current one is 86k... lets see the new one wil be what,btohqsg
for me car i can stare at and manual i happy alr,btohqsg
maybe decrease in a few years cause now we getting poor,btohqsg
most new car dont come in manual liao  dying transmission,btohqsg
Generally  is quite a bad time to get a car now unless you can get one that has a reasonable depre. But if you need it for work  then no time is a bad time i guess.,btohqsg
hahaha all these will cost him a few bombs,btohqsg
basically the more sporty cars will get the ancient transmission,btohqsg
yes cause their appeal is thr car community anyways no?,btohqsg
wait coe drop during the 10 year cycle which is around 6 years time,btohqsg
by then i working shuld drop alr,btohqsg
unless i buy toto win ah,btohqsg
hopefully drops can change to 400z,btohqsg
can get when i get license,btohqsg
@ToufuTigerWelcomes you into the Fit Jazz group next time :D,btohqsg
cause car for me is not die die i need,btohqsg
is a want for now uk,btohqsg
i prefer longer looking cars anyways,btohqsg
which is y i asking first,btohqsg
so ik what to expect and how much to save n all,btohqsg
i recommend get house first den car,btohqsg
when i no money  coe low,btohqsg
when i got money coe high,btohqsg
coe high or low  i always no money,btohqsg
when got money and coe reasonable  no car,btohqsg
reach 10 years my license i thought fuck la i need to buy,btohqsg
then that time i check  coe low lol,btohqsg
Thats how the economy works 😂,btohqsg
Instalment - 900Season parking - 0 (100 or so for HDB)Fuel - 400Servicing - 1 year 2 times  set aside $30 a month is more than enough.ERP - 0 (depends on where you go)Non season parking - 200Road tax - 900 for 6 monthsInsurance - set aside $200 a month also more than enough.1 month spendings about $2k a month.,btohqsg
I realised my spendings and@Gerardo85his the same.,btohqsg
Cos i copy and paste and didnt edit much,btohqsg
Steady  we be 400z friends tgt,btohqsg
for you the change will be easy,btohqsg
Average shld be around 2k to 3k for car expenses ba,btohqsg
My swift expenses very cheap actually,btohqsg
i think 1.2k a month only,btohqsg
mine the back seats used very often,btohqsg
Mine back seats almost never used at all😄😄😄,btohqsg
Thinking of removing my rear seats😅😅😅,btohqsg
"Roi: ""You guys even have back seats?""",btohqsg
you willing to get wet i not willing,btohqsg
By the time night dry alr lo,btohqsg
they all going for meet ah,btohqsg
hi guys  want to ask  now my windshield crack  due to rock chip  if i claim the $100 insurance thing to replace the windshield  will affect next year the insurance pricing or ncd?,btohqsg
Just that you cannot get back any rebate if you want to cancel your insurance prematurely (eg. Change car),btohqsg
To add on: Isit true that if during the 1year period  you have any insurance claim. You cannot get back the remaining amount if you cancel your plan early.,btohqsg
so i just pay the excess $100  will change the windshield  no increase in pricing and ncd wont affect ?,btohqsg
For your own peace of mind why not talk to your agent or the person who did the policy for you,btohqsg
Generally windscreen replacement doesnt affect NCD,btohqsg
They usually have website with chatbot or FAQ  or u can call,btohqsg
Most of the time it doesn't la,btohqsg
Ltr you policy dont even offer $100 excess for windshield,btohqsg
Makes no sense for something so small they reduce your NCD,btohqsg
if not you can go check your policy if it states windscreen change without affecting NCD,btohqsg
I swoped my windscreen out last yr without anything,btohqsg
Anyway. Being on non speaking terms with your insurance contact does not seem wise. Better find an alternative channel so if u ever need anything from your insurer you have a way,btohqsg
Makes no sense to let someone you not on good terms with to earn your money,btohqsg
You go leech his money can.,btohqsg
I can do that for you for under $50,btohqsg
Im upset now i saved this asuka 50 cm sticker on aliexpress but now I can’t find it,btohqsg
Yes  no rebate if have any claims (even if is windscreen claim),btohqsg
I think expo some car thing,btohqsg
i see so many ppl story,btohqsg
forgot when they sent the poster alr,btohqsg

I saying u can use yr deck as gauges,btohqsg
anyway the 64gb can get for $599,btohqsg
Yup and ownself upgrade the ssd,btohqsg
yeah i installed a 512 for less then $80 and then add a 512 sd card for less then 80 also,btohqsg
the aya is the stronger unit  but depending on the control layout  some games the steamdeck is better,btohqsg
Aya is a full normal pc right?,btohqsg
at 599 its damn worth it,btohqsg
value for money hard to beat the sd  I had a specific need for the aya so went for it.  The sd i bought is just to play with mods,btohqsg
put 1tb ssd total abt 800,btohqsg
i got both units so my stuff spread out,btohqsg
its half the cost of the aya,btohqsg
Too scary to play dead space on my pc... Cos my speaker is surround sound,btohqsg
i mainly play forza on the aya for now,btohqsg
Ya cos limited to steam games out of the box,btohqsg
you could install windows  then purchase a dodgy license from shopee,btohqsg
So now considering a new phone or sd,btohqsg
that was my original plan  but no egpu support,btohqsg
Yup i know... But i prefer stock,btohqsg
i already have an egpu enclosure thats why i wanted the aya,btohqsg
also you can get pirated games to work on both,btohqsg
