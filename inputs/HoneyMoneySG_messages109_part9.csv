Am reading this  as I am doing one time payment  no need GIRO. But will email IRAS to avoid conflict,btohqsg
Take note. You pay at cardup will take a few days to clear. Is not like paynow. Immediately,btohqsg
Oh. You're doing single payment. Then maybe just wait till end month to check. But why not repeat payment? There's absolutely no benefit to be on single payment over repeat payment  while vice versa does.,btohqsg
Am quite confused with the terminologies here. Kindly help a brother here 🙏🏾🙏🏾 So where is the first GIRO deduction in May getting money from if it's not from CardUp,btohqsg
Chose single payment this time as too confused with the set up (as above) .would certainly love to do recurring payments for next year's YOA,btohqsg
Thanks. I'll email them now to avoid misunderstanding,btohqsg
For CardUp payment for May  then in April of course.GIRO is always for the month itself.If not sure what to pay in Apr then let the first month be paid via GIRO (preferably through HSBC EGA).,btohqsg
In other words  for this to work smoothly  gotta settle for tax form asap  so can get NOA and then set up card up payment to start from April (for May due)?,btohqsg
You can setup using the estimated amount they provide in Mar. But if you file your own tax form then maybe you won't be able to setup CardUp for Apr already. I'm on no filling so no issues with me setting up my payments in Mar to start paying in Apr.,btohqsg
In this case  say I use hsbc ega for first month payment  then cardup for the rest  I'll have to then cannel the giro plan via hsbc as well?,btohqsg
No. Do not cancel the GIRO plan. Read the screenshot you sent,btohqsg
I see. Now the screenshot starts to make sense 😅😅,btohqsg
Next qn is  what card you used?,btohqsg
Thank you all. I'll do my homework and hopefully get to set this well for next year.,btohqsg
Uhh clocking 1.5mpd? 😅 I mean better than nothing..,btohqsg
What are some better options? Would love to know 🙏🏾🙏🏾,btohqsg
CardUp has a calculator which you can use to check all the cards that are eligible for rewards  and how much rewards they will get,btohqsg
What option did you go for  Melvyn?,btohqsg
Vantage was my highest earning card  (or so I believe is the case) hence I went for it,btohqsg

Anyone manage to link up Amaze card with SCB Manhattan card? Amaze failed to link up this card. Any advise?,btohqsg
But since haven’t received NOA  you don’t know the finalised monthly $  and then with cardup promo only 2x for 1.75% for visa  what is the strategy to make sure the 2x promo work?,btohqsg
It refers to your own funds  first $250 k,btohqsg
Hi can i ask if anyone know if this promotion is on top of the big savings payout? I have registered the big savings payout and have got the $1000 for the $150k so this promotion of giro  salary credit and divdend is on top of it if sign up?,btohqsg
Hey guys. I have question about Moomoo 6.8% for new user (30 days). Does it mean that the extra top up by moomoo will still be credited (next 3 working days) even when I withdraw the funds exactly after 30 days?,btohqsg
Called uob but the agent attending to me need to check and will call back,btohqsg
Please stop posting other people's content on my channel when no one asked for it and without context. Thanks.,btohqsg
Did you manage to check your end day balance from 30 Apr onwards? Should not have much transactions since the account shouldn't be used for daily usage anyway.,btohqsg
MP3 cash rebate have been credited for anyone who actually used it. 👀,btohqsg
Trust vs amaze  I've done this comparison 1 year agohttps://youtu.be/y-yHZas1amM,btohqsg
Actually bros I feel even now amaze going to nerb.. is still good to use amaze to earn 4 miles oversea.,btohqsg
But the worse I got it in Jan this year airport at hcm .. I buy sim card. When I was paying payment suddenly amaze card can't be used... no choice have to use scb card ...,btohqsg
I did remember to activate amaze card oversea... later on I eat with friends I try again.... the restaurant in vietnam accept amaze card. Lucky,btohqsg
I think you use cash better. No need think. Just pay.,btohqsg
buy viet wife can use amaze card?,btohqsg
Usually I use cash in spore when coffee shop or hawker. Or fun toast insist on paynow... so I pay cash,btohqsg
Nowadays I only keep 40$ in wallet. The rest just use samsung pay,btohqsg
We are not interested in how much cash you carry and how you pay for stuff. You can keep this to yourself.,btohqsg
The nerfs only affect top-ups and IP earning what. Why would it affect how good or not it is for people who are going to pay using linked card?People who pay using linked card are generally more concerned on:1. Avoid paying bank's 3.25% FX charges (albeit the rates are not as great as YouTrip/Trust - covered by rewards earned)2. Converting offline txns to online (this is considered a hack and may be patched anytime)This clearly shows you didn't even bother watching Chris' video that he generously sent a couple of minutes ago.,btohqsg
Can try AMEX pay or Citi payall,btohqsg
Previously I watch . I also agree with him... seriously I hope they won't take off the link to master cards. Or citi   uob nerd amaze... I be upset,btohqsg
Can try citipayall  since the name say can pay for all things,btohqsg
Once amaze removes those features  we will find new ways lor. For now just enjoy and swipe away 😀. I'm sure Chris will cover it when that happens. *touch wood* for Amaze not dumb enough to do that.,btohqsg
He scared people rob him  so he tell others only got 40$ inside  not worth it,btohqsg
Utilities can't citi pay all. And also keppel electricity bills. I already tried .,btohqsg
Thank you very much for your confirmationbut do you think viet wife can use Citi pay all,btohqsg
Actually some time such thing happen.. look at Dbs they remove amaze .. so means earn no reward points.,btohqsg
