Old cars won’t  those 2015 and above yes,btohqsg
oh i heard some ppl do turbo muffler delete and BOV tgt,btohqsg
1.4 stustustu ltr kena stomp lah..,btohqsg
Huh? No la not BOV. It is Compressor surge.It happens airflow to the intake manifold is low as you off throttle and the throttle body is now closed  but the air pressure from the turbo is high. Now this high air pressure should go somewhere  but there is no way to move forward. So this air pressure tries to escape back through the turbo making the stustustu sound  as the turbo blades are spinning in the opposite direction.,btohqsg
Stomp you for stustustu? Lame leh. Stomp those got back firing one better la,btohqsg
i know it's cool and all copy pasta from somewhere to sound clever... but what part do you think holds the boost and causes the turbo flutter?  hahaha,btohqsg
it's the diverter valve or BOV,btohqsg
just mod until you happy can liao,btohqsg
piang liao rebuild simple as that,btohqsg
i was planning if coe renew i will do one overhaul,btohqsg
Thanks for your feedback. I typed that out cause I remembered it cause my vehicle has them and to better understand it.You do not need any of those and in fact the lack of those is what causes the flutter. The divert valve and BOV are the things to prevent the flutter.This video would help you understand betterhttps://youtu.be/BFXIgME_5UA?si=Y_GPwZSwy7ZNqThW,btohqsg
Sport cat worth to fit not ah,btohqsg
