People who think they can change society,btohqsg
smuggling weed indicates that- you bypassed sg security to be able to get weed  so youre basically a threat to them- you broke the drug law- your money is dirty and you probably have set up an illegal business- you risk the security of people that help smuggle you the weed,btohqsg
i think singapore labels marijuana under rhe same lavel as the rest of the drugs,btohqsg
Because sales from drugs especially marijuana funds terrorism,btohqsg
thats why the tax is so high for large quantity of goods or luxury goods  the idea has always been detterent not destruction,btohqsg
the issue is weed unlike goods are not something that is required for a country to run,btohqsg
that is the same reason why firecrackers are banned...they dont contribute anything to the economy,btohqsg
casinos are how our country make money,btohqsg
that is not the reason...the same issue behind bubblegum  it was not banned because of littering/cleanliness issue,btohqsg
then do you believe bubblegum was banned because of cleanliness?,btohqsg
no im saying like bubblegum  firecrackers had another reason...just because they injure someone..or people died dont mean they get banned.There are alot of prohibited items allowed through ICA that could do more damage than a firecracker,btohqsg
you said there are prohibited items allowed through ICA,btohqsg
wrong source  give me a sec,btohqsg
first of all  if they intentionally allow it in it's not prohibited,btohqsg
There are people selling unauthorised sparkles through carousell,btohqsg
again  that doesn't mean they allow,btohqsg
if it was indeed a safety hazard...why would they still continue producing it in sg?,btohqsg
your ndp fireworks come from where,btohqsg
No im just saying..safety cant be the only reason. thats all,btohqsg
there was definitely another reason that weighed heavier,btohqsg
because bubblegum was not banned because of cleanliness,btohqsg
Im just saying what i believe..you dont believe its up to you...It does not concern or matter to me what you believe in.,btohqsg
you sound like an sg version of a flat earther rn,btohqsg
You tell me..if you truly believe it was because of clealiness  you think lky would change his mind that quickly?After his govt's new train system was getting disrupted,btohqsg
nah i dont believe in all these bs...what i believe in is that the govt will never be 100% on the ppl's side,btohqsg
i could give any less regard to politics  i just find it intresting...how the govt runs a country  how much a govt can manipulate its people to believe something as good or bad,btohqsg
Going OBS now  I hope I don't laosai,btohqsg
