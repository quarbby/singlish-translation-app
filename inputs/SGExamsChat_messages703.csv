I don't rly rmb shit from history anym,btohqsg
Why sec 5s generally tend to lack behind is because of the attitude the teacher has towards thwm like the teachers also teach very half assed so what for the students want to pay attention,btohqsg
yea one of my friend alr got A for his d and T..come sec 5  practically just use phone during that period,btohqsg
And also not believing that the students can do well,btohqsg
The other person ik who did the sec 5 to JC thing,btohqsg
This is why u take geog,btohqsg
According to Josh yt failed a levels,btohqsg
Majorly its this. And it sucks ah like my senior she is hardworking but her teachers dw to teach so end up she had to dae,btohqsg
atmosphes drives creativity and passion..if there is none  then expect ppl to not do well,btohqsg
Gauge on what subjects I absolutely hate,btohqsg
Wah I hated physics in o levels,btohqsg
And luckily she got in i was so happy for her,btohqsg
alot of my peers..do dae during the mid year and just use those results,btohqsg
I realised if I go do that subj for As,btohqsg
Express ppl take things for granted alw,btohqsg
I feel like I only rly realise when I talk to yall,btohqsg
Speaking from experience i was in one of the worst pure science class,btohqsg
Never doing tht ever again in my next lifetime.,btohqsg
there some teachers that keep the motivation high across streams but when there are changes..you def can tell,btohqsg
they were so nonchalant. English is v impt esp since the syllabus was tweaked abit then nobody bothered. But when their results were unsatisfactory they kept complaining,btohqsg
hey but on the bright side  last batch of possible sec 5's are sec 3 now,btohqsg
no leh. there’s still sec 5,btohqsg
Wait even for new system meh,btohqsg
aint it changed to everybody staying in sec school for max 4 yrs if you dont retain,btohqsg
students who take g1/g2 subjects in sec 4 can take g3 in sec 5,btohqsg
And alot of ppl were so rude to our teachers and classmates. I absolutely despised the clowns eh they were so noisy and distracting even when ppl complained the teachers did nothing,btohqsg
Like the ppl inside the class ah,btohqsg
4 years and take the SEC but they have the option of staying one more year to take higher level stuff,btohqsg
like if they wanna go JC or smth,btohqsg
Sec 4 i was mugging alot and was more reserved than sec 3 then omd there wld be ppl screaming in the classroom,btohqsg
basically comparing SEC to O and N levels is like,btohqsg
from what i can see is just more freedom in the subjects you can mix,btohqsg
Among the 3 pure science class my class was the rowdiest and most uncooperative one it was rlly shag everyday,btohqsg
My class more JC class than my actual JC class,btohqsg
end of the day sg runs on meritocracy,btohqsg
No class spirit at all. Everyone was quite selfish,btohqsg
can't expect sg to adopt the american mindset,btohqsg
Anything that is not math and sciences no one will care abt,btohqsg
Like no matter whr u go this will be the case,btohqsg
But if u show the same behaviour during math and science lessons then ngl ur abit fked,btohqsg
Tbf there's always people who just study better without chers (me),btohqsg
Ngl when I taught I just focused on students who cared,btohqsg
Not students who were gd at the subject,btohqsg
yep  they changed it to a graded intern for my batch and likely subsequent batches,btohqsg
"my father always say ""the govt cant just ""relax""  they have to wayang to show the ppl they are doing something""",btohqsg
I only needed 77.5 rp to go nus geog why try to get 90,btohqsg
like the mental health probs sg having now  a very good solution would be building another mental hospital or mental training facility..but nope  they are going to go through all these therapies/self help avenues instead,btohqsg
Ngl I feel like thsts why I didn't die after leaving most of my qns blank in a levels,btohqsg
My physics teacher started helping me out too when i actually started to listen and do work,btohqsg
I just set extremely low standards for myself,btohqsg
therapy can only go so far mah  i mean what other options are there?,btohqsg
and idk why i didnt drop the ppl who were distracting me earlier,btohqsg
Mental health can be fixed by Mental health institutions,btohqsg
mix of alot of factors all relating to progress? from what i see ah,btohqsg
They generally do better than me because of tuition but i didnt have tuition so i was mad that they werent being understanding,btohqsg
and alot of ppl joke ard eh abt imh,btohqsg
i only needed 60+ RP to get into physics so why bother studying,btohqsg
"what other ways can sg address the issue of progress..the old been saying it to our face so many times ""sg must be number 1""",btohqsg
Just to prove to his parents he can get 90,btohqsg
Who want to go imh if ppl r a bunch of retards that say: r u ok? U shld go imh u belong there,btohqsg
His math went from a D to a B,btohqsg
im honestly going to say  my idea makes sense but i dont think is foolproof..let natural selection happen to the people with the old mindset,btohqsg
Lol i mean we dont have to go far they cant addres the issue cos they have to admit it after having taylor swift spend like 10 nights here or sth,btohqsg
Rn is a problem because idt our politicians or leaders actually know how useful IMH is,btohqsg
"There's a PSC scholar in my camp from RI who was like ""wow IMH is the solution for all mental problems!""",btohqsg
(I kid u not he said that),btohqsg
but they cant have everyone gg there,btohqsg
"i honestly dont think because of how singapore's society is built...our govt will ever think of solutions where it will take a ""long time""",btohqsg
Addressing and raising awareness on mental health problems,btohqsg
Telling me nth by telling me smth response,btohqsg
Maybe I shud have applied psc,btohqsg
it wont  cause you forgotten..our govt just gonna continue taking in foreginers to sustain the society so far,btohqsg
mental health is like any sickness,btohqsg
It got its ups and downs,btohqsg
For the sake of convenience with people online,btohqsg
I don't have the energy to discuss singapore politics rn,btohqsg
Especially with people who are one-sided,btohqsg
parents prolly had depression before thus they were traumatised then they made their children depressed then trauma again and it goes on,btohqsg
Talking abt this ryan guy dw,btohqsg
I just finished my scholarship essay,btohqsg
Idk whats the main point here i feel like we're all yapping,btohqsg
Which is defo easier said than done uk,btohqsg
idk what im supposed to udnerstand,btohqsg
Havent seen him for q long,btohqsg
ive always thought about these but im always stuck on two approaches,btohqsg
i also love digging old history  you aint the only one,btohqsg
I just don't talk cux I have other stuff to do,btohqsg
But then they continued to doxx me regardless,btohqsg
And just told them to stfu,btohqsg
honestly all these backend politics of singapore  ive condensed it into very short point forms answers..like for this i would think is due to the unwillingness of the locals to take on certain jobs at a desired pay,btohqsg
I need wake up at 5 tmr,btohqsg
Stop complaining sbt ur papers being hard,btohqsg
Then I got doxxed for it,btohqsg
I don't rmb most of the sgexams lor,btohqsg
Over  ppl telling u to shut up and stop complaining abt ur paper,btohqsg
Smth smth they have the right to complain cuz other batches also complain,btohqsg
But they were complaining abt a paper that happened 2 weeks ago,btohqsg
then isit  the incentives given to foreigners are very lucrative?,btohqsg
Then when people saw the paper it was like,btohqsg
I rmb last time I also,btohqsg
no the funniest part was how they went on about how seab has it out for them,btohqsg
Ngl kuro why u think they importing foreigners to singapoee,btohqsg
Dont try to act like ure better cos its what u arent,btohqsg
Seab hates people born in 07,btohqsg
Oh i was abit like tht last yr,btohqsg
every year will be like this,btohqsg
But i penned it down on the extra foolscap they gave us during the break between exams,btohqsg
Except 05 didn't complain that much abt a levels last yr,btohqsg
IT WAS JUST THE CIRCLE QN EH,btohqsg
And the long qn at the back,btohqsg
Idh energy to do anything intellectusl,btohqsg
The rest i wld say its like if u get it u get it if u dont then u just dont.,btohqsg
I just had to read gp essays,btohqsg
i rmb cna did a whole video on my year's psle paper because ppl been going around saying it was going to be the hardest paper in 10 years,btohqsg
Wah when 07 collect a lvl results,btohqsg
Reading gp essays takes away my will to live,btohqsg
O level was just questionable it was js different than tys esp for chem i had the shock of my life the moment i flipped the page but i yoloed the paper,btohqsg
Different from tys then U R like eh wdf,btohqsg
07s i feel is the weirdest batch,btohqsg
But i fr feel weird being an 07,btohqsg
Thr was a cna article abt it?,btohqsg
And how i rlly want to travel back to stone age,btohqsg
article? no a whole video on it,btohqsg
I think i watched tht video,btohqsg
Ok but for all we know,btohqsg
Every single kid will complain abt national exams,btohqsg
Nobody will ever say: oh my god i did great im gonna surely pass with flying colours! Im pretty sure i got them mostly right!,btohqsg
just a guess? if not why would they fly to singapore specifically. at least thats my thought process,btohqsg
Here is a sneak peak of what I have to read,btohqsg
and the latter seems more viable,btohqsg
Oh no the icebergs in Antarctica,btohqsg
Only for like sci research rn,btohqsg
Tbf tourism gp essays always abit iffy to me cuz everyone thinks of tourism as vacationing,btohqsg
CNA only made two specific videos targeted at PSLE..both videos were from 2016,btohqsg
All removed from o level geog,btohqsg
oh right yea..then i mean the overwhelming point is what you mention lorh,btohqsg
birthrate falling below 1 is no laughing matter..but at the same time i dont feel like the govt care much about that tbh,btohqsg
"just quick fix one after another..to show people  the govt is trying to ""mitigate"" this issue of low birthrates. from my perspective",btohqsg
"all those ""one time payments"" i suppose",btohqsg
oh yea btw..ill be paragraphing ppl in other channels lol,btohqsg
aint that what sg grappled with in the 1990s,btohqsg
and my para to his statement lolz,btohqsg
this is something ive thought off for a very long time  i even dicussed it with my father  he was a millenial and in the end  he subsided because of that final 2nd paragraph,btohqsg
yea i understood that point  thats why i ended it with that final paragraph,btohqsg
lol  but ill just end off that i did not think they had it easy  i just think they had it easier.eitherway  now just focus and look ahead. just do as much as i can for my generation. thats it,btohqsg
they are not even classified under the same cat tho,btohqsg
my school is A math is compulsory then must take 1 pure and 1 elect humanities,btohqsg
my cousin school did not offer pure lit at all sia,btohqsg
but she end up taking H2 and H3 lit now,btohqsg
i should have taken elect geog instead of elect lit... my lit + ss = disaster lol...,btohqsg
the batch after me was offered music 💀,btohqsg
i tot music need take from sec 1??,btohqsg
they should make econs as part of humanities and offer it to more schs,btohqsg
econs is now not anything...it is just considered a relevant subject in L1R5 computation...sigh,btohqsg
if econs was a humanities  i would have scored 2 points better,btohqsg
tbh they can solve this 'too easy to score' problem by letting more schools offer it,btohqsg
o-level econs easy to score ah,btohqsg
my teacher told us that o lvl econs right is just a competition among us,btohqsg
coz i think the main competition is TMS and TKGS,btohqsg
not being mean but the other 2 schools were of much lower caliber (sry idk a better phrase for it),btohqsg
then my school always have record of > 90% distinction,btohqsg
but it is not that it is easy to score  in fact there is a lot of content...like the book is quite thick,btohqsg
but comparing Os and As  Os is definitely more content regurgitation and less analysis,btohqsg
My Geog teacher focuses on the weakest student,btohqsg
how does a teacher focus on student,btohqsg
my teacher just teach the class normally  dun target anyone lol,btohqsg
teach her during self study and have only extra lessons with her,btohqsg
she rejected everyone's request for consultation,btohqsg
tbh my friend lucky got me to jio...but i go consult with them only to scare them,btohqsg
that was part of LLP  Music became a elective for the batch after me,btohqsg
This is why the philosophy of if idk 80% of the batch dk works,btohqsg
Isnt combine = ss / elect something,btohqsg
Oh there is such a thing?,btohqsg
The only schs ik who don't offer it are the upper tier sec schs,btohqsg
My sch only offers 2 pure or 3 pure or combined sci (chem / bio),btohqsg
But i would rather a pure chem tho,btohqsg
Even if ur in an IP sch u shud still know what other schs have what,btohqsg
I rmbr I saw it exists but idk of any schs that does it,btohqsg
Because the way combined work is it's just one subject code then diff papers per diff combi,btohqsg
I thought it was only pure bio+combined phys/chem,btohqsg
My sec sch geog Cher took that,btohqsg
But I only found out about combined phys/bio slightly later,btohqsg
Once again the prisoners in selarang prison complex are shouting at me,btohqsg
So they can see us from inside,btohqsg
And then sometimes they will shout at us,btohqsg
From my poly  you also could see a prison  granted it's closed,btohqsg
esp since so many ppl take econs in jc,btohqsg
ik hwachong high offers econs (as like an ip4 subject) but my friend said they're removing it cause they wanna make the IP syllabus more similar to o level,btohqsg
also i heard some ip schools are cutting down on the jc content taught in ip to follow more closely to O level but i dont have a written source  its all hearsay so take with grain of salt,btohqsg
I didn't know comb+pure is a thing until my express friend told me,btohqsg
They definitely won’t until moe develops their own syllabus and paper and is able to offer it to more schs,btohqsg
The international version is too easy and not as Singapore oriented as h2 Econs,btohqsg
Speaking of which  I didn't know some ppl actly took econs during Os,btohqsg
like their sch actly offers it,btohqsg
There’s a few here including me,btohqsg
How is it compared to the As econs,btohqsg
is it built upon the Os econs,btohqsg
Some schs have 100% dist rate in some years,btohqsg
Some of the concepts yes but answering technique is much more difficult,btohqsg
Also like I said less Singapore oriented since we using international version,btohqsg
would you say your As Econs is superb cause of prior Econs background like during Os,btohqsg
No mention of MP centred on exchange rate,btohqsg
It only gives a slight advantage,btohqsg
Like to you on a scale of 1-10 how slight is that advantage,btohqsg
Not as much as like a math student taking h2 math vs a student who took only e math but took h2 math,btohqsg
Actually some ppl will say barely too,btohqsg
So it's not insignificant but it's somewhat there ah,btohqsg
The 8 mark “essay” qns for o level Econs if you write concisely it’s possible to get full credit with like 30-40 words in some cases,btohqsg
Even some of the answers which are not really using Econs technical terms correctly they accept,btohqsg
Wah I wonder if the writing style is diff from SS and hist,btohqsg
Cause from what I've heard there's some overlaps btw SS and hist in terms of the format? But not rlly,btohqsg
It’s so much easier than SS/history/geog,btohqsg
No wonder they dw offer it as part of a sub combi,btohqsg
Like geography LORMs they expect so much for 8 marks,btohqsg
like I rmb for my sch   neighbourhood sch ah idk is it cause of that that's why they don't offer or not enof manpower,btohqsg
I can find the mark scheme and send later,btohqsg
Uk a levels they don’t rly care about copyright so past year papers and answers can all be found online,btohqsg
it's my time to shine 😈😈,btohqsg
I haven't seen actual As h1 Econ qns yet but i feel like the qns phrasing are at most weird and tricky,btohqsg
but once figured out it's all g?,btohqsg
Some h1 Econs qns can be very hard,btohqsg
Imma prob sound dumb but it can't be harder than H2 rite,btohqsg
as in harder than some of the H2 qns,btohqsg
I mean I’m talking about qns wise for csq,btohqsg
It’s just that the content is less so it may be easier in that respect,btohqsg
But less breadth doesn’t mean lower difficulty for each of the qns,btohqsg
Like some of the h1 Econs csq qns are harder than h2,btohqsg
Singapore women earned 14.3% less than men in 2023  according to MOM data.The gap has narrowed over last 5 years.https://str.sg/G6dN,btohqsg
does anyone here listen to ariana grande,btohqsg
Take a look at this 8 mark econs question lol. Legit just writing “High wages may increase cost of production  leading to inflation and lowering international competitiveness  decreasing exports. But workers may feel appreciated  motivating them to work harder  increasing demand for labour” can alr get full credit,btohqsg
It’s definitely not the best though,btohqsg
I just wanted to make fun of kuro,btohqsg
But I heard something like with the syllabus revision in 2020 where they changed it from 6 choose 3 qns to 4 choose 3 in paper 2  they added an evaluation component to make it harder to get full credit but it’s still very easy,btohqsg
Ok I just wasn’t sure if you heard of the bad stuff there also,btohqsg
I’ve never been there before so whatever I’m typing is hearsay  but I’m quite sure most of them are true. Ever since they expanded they’ve lowered the quality of the teachers who got in and some of them can’t teach properly. It also seems that students go there to socialise than to learn properly  like they offer a lot of “welfare” to the point I think students are going there to get benefits from their parents money rather than to study lol. I’ve heard a lot of mixed reviews.,btohqsg
Ya that’s what i thought too,btohqsg
Reddit also has ppl which talk badly about their experience in zenith,btohqsg
I think they focus highly on student welfare then students like wah 10% off this and that,btohqsg
Yeah lol. But I heard for Econs they managed to spot some of the essay qns last year,btohqsg
My Econs Cher was saying those tuition centres which spend a lot on welfare is some kind of moral hazard,btohqsg
I couldn’t draw the link based on what was taught in the Econs syllabus though,btohqsg
But anyway yeah it does sound wrong,btohqsg
Low key throwing shade on zenith,btohqsg
those are more of like socialising places as compared to actl tuition centres,btohqsg
they legit said they willing to give free airpods for students who join 1 class,btohqsg
not sure if i want to go tuition or not,btohqsg
cos idek which tuitions r reliable,btohqsg
later they teach wrong thing or the tcher not good,btohqsg
aiya better to ask school teachers la hor,btohqsg
Nah. They just call it paper 2. Like structured qns without extracts or preamble,btohqsg
Each qn is split into parts of 2 4 6 8,btohqsg
ya ya true i went for one of their trial lessons n they deadass said that u shld join us to get free ipad airpods apple watch and im like ????,btohqsg
Ngl I have a classmate who's under them,btohqsg
im in tuition to study bro i couldnt care less abt these kinds of goodies,btohqsg
she said it's worth it altho it's ex,btohqsg
yeah but like i also want additional practices and help bc im a slow learner so i tend to learn ahead of the lecture in case i can’t pick up too quickly.. but teachers won’t help if you’re ahead of lecture that’s why im looking into getting tuition,btohqsg
No tuition gay WHERE YALL AT,btohqsg
and it says o/n at the bottom...,btohqsg
My bad got preamble for section B. I forgot alr,btohqsg
Yall can see how easy it is,btohqsg
Oh icic the qns are much more simplified,btohqsg
A levels so hard to score,btohqsg
I mean you gotta have smth in return for the costly tuition fees,btohqsg
why do u think they mention that,btohqsg
The grade thresholds. But since Singapore uses A1 A2 etc they should be using a separate grade boundary,btohqsg
ya but one person said that the teachers not v good....,btohqsg
ngl the airpods about same cost as the tuition itself 💀,btohqsg
It’s just welfare to attract ppl lol,btohqsg
Transfer parents money into student’s pockets,btohqsg
I mean it is what it is,btohqsg
but got ppl fall for their attractive shit,btohqsg
actl the fees aren’t that expensive it’s comparable to other tuition centres,btohqsg
idk if you actly learn shit from there,btohqsg
But damn A* for one of the combinations is 83%. Shows how easy it is to score,btohqsg
brooo i heard from my friends that their tuition is good and im like...?,btohqsg
i thought everyone say its bad?,btohqsg
ask if it's because of welfare,btohqsg
If they say smth along the lines of aiya they teach okok but welfare sibei good,btohqsg
why bring down your ego and face reality that you spend money for subpar teaching amirite,btohqsg
But their trail lessons kinda generous ykwim,btohqsg
Maybe sec sch better than JC,btohqsg
They give out free notes rite,btohqsg
What is ITE life like? Out of curiosity.,btohqsg
that i nvr touched ever agin,btohqsg
cos i scared they teach wrong thing,btohqsg
it’s quite normal  go school  go out with friends if u want. depends on which course u go for.. but deadlines are very tight as well  so need put in consistent effort,btohqsg
i was referring to that man,btohqsg
Idk if I recall stuff wrongly  but I thought nameless cat seemed to be easily offended when I joined long time ago,btohqsg
idk got what tuition good atp,btohqsg
my friend said the learning lab is good,btohqsg
higher nitec mentioned!! wtf is touching grass RAHHHHH,btohqsg
and like achevas is good for math?,btohqsg
it’s not for ppl who can’t do fundamentals,btohqsg
that’s why I didn’t benefit out of tll,btohqsg
ya my fund super weak.. but they’ll just move on bc the rest of the students can cope,btohqsg
wait why do u say this,btohqsg
I mean I can ask for additional help,btohqsg
did anyone go for illume's GP tuition?,btohqsg
my friend said that TLL is for fast learners..,btohqsg
Learning lab I thought is for more of Pri sch,btohqsg
and that all the RI students go there,btohqsg
quit in 3 months found a better private tutor,btohqsg
because... yk they learn fast asf,btohqsg
yup my brother goes there.. he did well from it,btohqsg
my friend used it since pri sch... until now in jc he still going to that same tuition,btohqsg
yeah same but I soon came to realise it wasn’t for me la,btohqsg
but my friend is a fast learner la,btohqsg
Must have spent more than100k on that tuition centre alone,btohqsg
my eyes never fail me except sci practicals,btohqsg
yeah that’s great the extra practices they give are also very good if you understand the topics well enough,btohqsg
ya must read from eye level,btohqsg
i nvr went for tuition in the first place,btohqsg
just didnt know which ones were trustworthy,btohqsg
No cause in pri sch my parents made me go but I usually goof off during tuition,btohqsg
just solely relied on the internet and my school teachers,btohqsg
at least it worked out p well,btohqsg
I used to write BTS Blackpink and Twice fanfictions with my friend during tuitions,btohqsg
Like those cringey rose x jungkook fanfics,btohqsg
It was a dark era and I was 12,btohqsg
ya and write stuff like under *** in sge,btohqsg
Now my chinese has failed me,btohqsg
my classmates getting titration values with 23 while im getting 29,btohqsg
You just had to be like ththatat,btohqsg
cause my parents want me to go,btohqsg
im not A1 caliber (DEFINITELY NOT REFERRING TO ANYONE),btohqsg
And i didnt want to stop cause i wanted to talk to my friends during tuition,btohqsg
dawg i have a double digit raw,btohqsg
definitely a student in raffles or hc,btohqsg
i wish i took hcl 😭😭😭😭,btohqsg
ya your life wld be so easy in j1,btohqsg
Is it? how yk? is it yijc standard not good enough for you? how would u know?,btohqsg
i heard that hcl is more difficult than h1 chinese? according to my peers,btohqsg
my belief:complete paper = minimally C6 for hcl,btohqsg
d7 and below ppl cfm never finish paper one,btohqsg
ok so matcha didn’t complete her paper,btohqsg
how does that grading system even work,btohqsg
can u stop having split personality,btohqsg
matcha for the love of god,btohqsg
then what is the D supposed to mean,btohqsg
eh don’t tell me tell the person I reply to im not from ite,btohqsg
yijc is the closest to ite,btohqsg
can u decide which sch u want to be in,btohqsg
theyre just 2 bus stops away from ite cc,btohqsg
"Im a guai shu shu not a ""her""",btohqsg
can I just call you octopus,btohqsg
can u like check ur dms,btohqsg
Im 40 yo unemployed uncle.@chemcercan confirm,btohqsg
I GOT ALOT OF FRINDS THERE,btohqsg
asian parents would like to argue,btohqsg
tbf... this sterotype hard to change ah,btohqsg
"""the I in ITE STANDS FOR IDIOT!!! UNDERSTAND???""",btohqsg
Should i write an informative comment or nah,btohqsg
like in my jc alr got how many love to shit on ite students daily,btohqsg
that’s mad remove the quotation marks we all know u said it yourself,btohqsg
theres a lot of elitist students in my class so...,btohqsg
bro i did not say that,btohqsg
every jc other than yi is bad,btohqsg
like u go arts stream u get laughed at  u go poly u get laughed at... aiyo,btohqsg
the ppl in my class abit -.-,btohqsg
I think u glorify your sch,btohqsg
cmon man yi disrespect is not tolerated,btohqsg
Ya  especially RI. According to some minister.,btohqsg
ur dip can actually get a job...,btohqsg
"the guy who said ""STFU"" in the auditorium is gold",btohqsg
a level cert only good for uni...,btohqsg
That’s why kuro went from a levels to poly,btohqsg
u wanna dox ppl go to sgteens,btohqsg
He gonna have the smarts and skills,btohqsg
but unfortunately... this world is liddat,btohqsg
in most countries around the world vocational schools r very much frowned upon compared to pre u education,btohqsg
I think kurt tay is in here,btohqsg
in other countries prob more elitist  i hv a friend from germany and he said that hes automatically looked down on just because he didnt go to a pre u edu  even though he said he prefers hands on learning,btohqsg
And if i screw alvl is honggan for me alr,btohqsg
at least in sg  poly n ite students can still get a shot at uni. in other countries the moment u enter vocational schs ur chances of entering uni is close to 0 no matter how hard u work,btohqsg
Is it wrong to say that poly is basically just a better version of ite,btohqsg
I don’t know much about this,btohqsg
Yeah  ofc for poly. That’s why some ppl go to poly after completing higher Nitec  after they get their poly diploma can go to local U,btohqsg
But ite degree can enter uni directly?,btohqsg
