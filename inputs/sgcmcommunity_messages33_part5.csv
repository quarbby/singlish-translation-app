Car should be cheaper. More car manufacturing move to China or out of China. Depends  KIA Sonet manufacture in India.COEs always depends on quota. If new quotas more than available quota. It's a  Bidding war.,btohqsg
War... Stepping on thin thread now.üò¢,btohqsg
Problem with ev is no maintenance  so a big cut of profit is gone for servicing. That why the transition to ev car should cost higher,btohqsg
Don't need to service. Or maintenance or repair.Just like mobile phone.Every 6mth new versionOr battery üîã Dies.  Battery got per charge life span. Average 1300 charge for mobile phone. Not sure for cars battery.If Change battery is too expensive  driver will change cars.Your Tesla battery from Stuttgart motor was 100 000?,btohqsg
Monthly update is free   and can be done at home   with no maintenance ad and dealer profit margin been take away a big pie,btohqsg
So to me they should factor in at the selling price to keep afloat,btohqsg
Ev is like upfront cost high   but low running cost,btohqsg
this war n spike in oil seems like a  conspiracy do switch all to EV,btohqsg
Nah. Politics stuff.Saudi Arabia angry with US.Refuse to pump more oil and start selling Oil in CNY.üòÖJust pray China don't go to war.They will store food/water/oil.Small country. Good Game.,btohqsg
I give u an example u compare m4 with i4   m4 premium is at 25% vs i4 at 52%,btohqsg
This is local context.Petrol Tax is $0.69/ Litre.If you base on 10yr COE. That is alot of petrol tax returns.There will be carbon tax soon?Now DC charger is $0.45/kWh? Will go up to $0.65 - $0.75/KWH I believe.Unless Singapore goes Nuclear power.Now our power plant are currently waste desalination plant or petrol/diesel generators.,btohqsg
No no nothing do with these   what I mean is car price might never go down already as dealer now need to rely a lot on selling premium as more and more ev,btohqsg
Even coe is lower but the car price will still be very high,btohqsg
On premium cars?How about cheaper BYD. Very affordable,btohqsg
Can drive la this but just not eggciting,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt said premium car let said Hyundai,btohqsg
But even the Ioniq 5 is classed under ‚Äúpremium‚Äù alr,btohqsg
Like same as EV6 from Kia,btohqsg
Yes they need to as it is the best way to transit,btohqsg
What I mean is the income la haha for dealers   as if less car service or sign package with them their earning drop ma,btohqsg
I think all the dealer and car workshop are facing this issue worldwide,btohqsg
Maybe no more dealer.Direct sale from Manufacturer like Tesla.Earn from manufacturing. Lower cost. Aluminium?,btohqsg
Not easy to remove dealer also haha,btohqsg
They had gone a long way with manufacturers,btohqsg
Only new brand can. Like Tesla and BYD.,btohqsg
We are discussing if price will go down anot haha,btohqsg
Hyundai possible? Since got manufacturing plant in Singapore.Contract up with C&C. Maybe Can exit,btohqsg
Then the ice car leh haha,btohqsg
Slowly die.No More petrol car by 2040?We Could be like Japan. Young working adults don't prefer buying cars.,btohqsg
Ya but when petrol car get lesser and lesser the price should go up ma,btohqsg
Cause scale of sales is very important,btohqsg
It like I am a dealer selling a brand every year in this small sg I got 5 k sales only and need maintain such a nice show room,btohqsg
Then now with ev my sales dropping by 20% year to year,btohqsg
The only way I survive is increase my margin,btohqsg
Actually now if people are educated about the margin,btohqsg
Why would people still get from dealers,btohqsg
I just feel as a whole most are quite shady,btohqsg
Slowly exit lo.Likes the Old Maserati dealer.   He didn't wanna continued with Maserati.He went to sell yacht üòÇüëç,btohqsg
Especially when their salespeople actually earn thru nonsense like loans and insurance comms,btohqsg
Ya but during this period of time the price should go up ma haha,btohqsg
That just my guessing la   as I notice as price the ev premium to be very high,btohqsg
Price Should  go down very soon.Interest rates up.Fixed deposit rates up,btohqsg
Sometime in buisness u know there is demand and neeed u won‚Äôt go down margin 1 haha,btohqsg
Too many variable liao so to me don‚Äôt hope coe go down   can price will drop a lot,btohqsg
See how much cash you have loNot enough money. U need to liquidate car stocks.,btohqsg
Go buy toto with all ur savings  with as many permutations as ur savings allow  and hope that one of them strike jackpot,btohqsg
this 4.5k come in Sg will be how muchüòõüòõ,btohqsg
Make cars foldable la. Can fold small until like iphone. Then pap cannot justify coe existence,btohqsg
U can fold  make sure don‚Äôt unfold it on the road‚Ä¶ once it‚Äôs on the road  charge u $70k for coe,btohqsg
Maybe next time eletric bicycle a big hit,btohqsg
