That would mean fresh fund of $500 on top of the salary credited in?,btohqsg
Do the $500 transfer in on 1st of every month if you intend to transfer ur credited salary out,btohqsg
Yes. This is the easiest way to monitor ADB.,btohqsg
Would it be possible to upon salary crediting  withdraw it out and transfer back $500?,btohqsg
Also  does OCBC allow Fund Transfer - Salary?,btohqsg
Firstly  do you know how to calculate ADB?,btohqsg
Not too sure  would appreciate some explanation! üôèüèª,btohqsg
ADB=taking your account balance on each day in the month  adding them together  then dividing by the number of days in the month.,btohqsg
I see!! So example:Apr 1: $3KApr 2 - 30: $3.5K(3K + (3.5K x 29 days) / 30ADB = $3483.33Is that so?,btohqsg
Ur usage is it mainly online and mobile contactless? Or can u share usage cases?,btohqsg
I got it now!! Thanks a lot!,btohqsg
Not so sure  cause paynow doesn‚Äôt give rewards. So I always use amaze card when I‚Äôm in Malaysia.,btohqsg
I guess you could say so! I havent tried mobile contactless for other things except for transport yet. I have seen that the UOB Evol is an option for this.,btohqsg
So if you create a lot of transactions in n out on the account during the month  it will only make your life difficult to calculate ADB. Keep the account transactions as less as possible. Make sure it is at least $500 ADB more compare to previous month.,btohqsg
Understood! With this I'm with OCBC360 now but might look to switch to UOB One as it's lesser hoop to achieve 3.85%,btohqsg
Can I check whether the 90n miles and ocbc$ be chained together as one miles conversion transaction? Purpose : Just pay one conversion fees - $25üòÅ,btohqsg
Mobile contactless means u need to first add the card to your mobile pay wallet (such as Samsung Pay  Apple Pay),btohqsg
Hi expects does anyone know if I can just top up my e-wallet (shoppee pay walletl using the yuu card to get the new sign up bonus?,btohqsg
No  topup to wallet is excluded,btohqsg
The simple way for ocbc 360 is1). to transfer in $500 on 1st of every month.2). When salary and interest are credited into the account  transfer it out by end of the day. So ADB will remain $500 increase.Just this two transactions per month. I believe it is easier to achieve. I personally have not used OCBC 360 before n I plan to open the account in next few weeks.Remember to spend at least $500 on OCBC 90N monthly to meet 4.65% criteria  Or else 4.05%.Other can give comments if it works.,btohqsg
Yes just fellow step 1 and 2  this works. The interest for salary  save and spend category credited separately,btohqsg
This is really helpful! I will try this out  thanks for making it digestible üôèüèª,btohqsg
So far this is the only way.,btohqsg
Very unfortunate!! But probably gotta speak to HR.UOB's allow for paynow salary,btohqsg
Anyone know if I use AXS to pay for credit card.. using Citibank rewards card as payment can? I know no rewards it‚Äôs ok.,btohqsg
Axs does not offer CC as a payment option for CC bills.,btohqsg
How about using HSBC EGA debit card? Got 1% cashback?,btohqsg
Axs accepts debit cards  but axs payments are on the exclusion list  so no rewards.,btohqsg
That's why the grab nerf was a big thing  as it was the most straightforward method to pay CC bills with CC.,btohqsg
I heard from sethisfy   you can earn grab reward using ocbc nxt credit card,btohqsg
One more thing you need to monitor is if your balance in OCBC 360 is more than $100 000  you need to ‚Äúreset‚Äù it at certain period. This is because amount above $100k earns very low interest. Ie 0.5%. Only.,btohqsg
Hi  i can see that grab  shoppee pay  wise etc are on the participating billing organisations list of eGIRO. Anyone has already used eGIRO to pay for those companies ? In what situation ?,btohqsg
Perhaps is those businesses who use shopee or Grab to advertise their product n need to pay them monthly fee ?,btohqsg
How to get interest for spend category?,btohqsg
hi guys  quick question  what is a good cashback card for me to put about 8k on  it should not have a low cashback cap. It is travel-related (hotel  overseas restaurants),btohqsg
for example ocbc 365 caps at $80,btohqsg
My first CC which I‚Äôm using currently is HSBC revo  u can consider that,btohqsg
Only a matter of time before they patch the hacks.,btohqsg
Scb Manhattan ü´£But now uob lady solitaire! But u need to split months.,btohqsg
Actually to play the cashback game u need to be dilligence and assign the right type of spend to get the best reward of each card. Which also means u need to juggle multiple cards.No such thing as one card (pun intended) can do everything.,btohqsg
Typically u will have1. A good general spending card2. Good dining card3. Good grocery card,btohqsg
oh I am actually finding a card to put a one lum sum on it  so something that does not have a low cap for cashback,btohqsg
Then there is only one answer. Scb Manhattan.,btohqsg
cimb world mastercard for overseas spend  unlimited 3% rebate 2.5% fx fees,btohqsg
Zenn is after a big one shot travel spend.,btohqsg
Hi can ask anyone who has experience lately with pacific light electricity +hsbc card promo?,btohqsg
If existing hsbc card holder can I get the 200 rebate by switching provider pls? Not entirely clear on the website,btohqsg
That‚Äôs what I missed last month. I didn‚Äôt transfer out during salary day  and I missed the save bonus :(,btohqsg
So let‚Äôs say last month is 3K ADB. Since there is a need to increase 500 for this month  do it means that with 3488.33 means will not hit the save bonus?,btohqsg
