I understand if I use credit card directly.  Its like 3.25% charge.N if use via amaze got some reduction. So end up paying abt 2.5%.My dining category in uob ladies is 6mpd. So I guess it's still.worth it.,btohqsg
My thought is instead of using Uob one account and potentially losing interest if the promotion didnt happens cos you empty out  Can we use the stash account instead? Keep it to minimum amount $1k. When the promotion happens  transfer in 100k and after earmark  transfer out leaving $1k inside. It is less hassle to manage and trying to guess the next round of promotion as well.,btohqsg
Hey Just want to check  if I spend just $600 on online spend for UOB EVOL  will I still get $40 cashback or just $20 ?Any one kind enough to give me some clarity.Thank you üôè,btohqsg
I also use amaze pair with citi cashback. With 6% dining  groceries cashback  still better than youtrip  trust etc.,btohqsg
Yup..cos.you trip.doesnt earn any pts. But good thing is good exchange rates. N no.fees,btohqsg
If you plan things correctly  you will only lose minimal interest if you empty out at the last few days at the end of the quarter and the promotion doesn‚Äôt materialise.You could use your stash acct instead  but then the question is where is this fresh 100k coming from  and what is the opportunity cost. Cos if you use UOB One it‚Äôs almost 0 opportunity cost since the money would have been sitting in the UOB One account anyways  with or without the promo.,btohqsg
but stash if withdraw early then the balance drop will get the bonus interest?,btohqsg
The highest level technique is to have balances above $100k (for example $108k) for 28 days of the month. Then last 3 days u can keep it at $10.And ADB is still 100 0xx.xx and u get the full 5% pa interest.I use excel to calculate. Use whatever method u are comfortable with.,btohqsg
Hello everyone! I‚Äôve just joined here after seeing YouTube channel! Hope learn a lot here üòÉüôè,btohqsg
That will a good approach as it negates the losing of interest for the last 3 days and if the promotion didn‚Äôt materialize,btohqsg
You need to plan correctly such that your 27 or 29 days out of 31 days of MAB this month is higher than previous month 29 days of MAB.Eg. If last month your MAB is $100k  this month you need $114815 of MAB if u plan to zero it on 28 MarIf u plan to withdraw on 30 Mar  u need to have $106897 of MAB till 29 Mar.,btohqsg
Hi can I check for uob krisflyer to pay insurance using cardup will it be considered 3mpd?,btohqsg
If I have spend 800 in krisshop,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword‚ÄúCardup calculator‚Äùto search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
before 30 march  i will top up 100k. i plan to withdraw the 100k once the funds has been ear mark. so after that it will have 100k earning 5%pa  and get the cash rewards of $558 after 4 months. is that correct?,btohqsg
Thabks but the cardup website only uses the Base 1.2mpd to calculate but didnt say if 3mpd is eligible or not,btohqsg
Cardup said all eligible cards only earn base miles. No bonus miles will be awarded.,btohqsg
You cannot withdraw while the funds are earmarked,btohqsg
Maybe he meant withdrawing the 100k that isn‚Äôt earmarked,btohqsg
I got 1 too. From some hotel in Finland. Called them and they said no actual transaction so it's ok. They will make a note and forward it to the relevant department.,btohqsg
In this scenario  what is your Dec 31 day-end balance? Note the T&C states that you need to maintain the incrementon top of the Dec 31 day-end balancethroughout the earmark period.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/180050,btohqsg
It‚Äôs also repeated here ‚ÄúYou are required to maintain‚Ä¶‚Äù,btohqsg
I got the physical card and also cannot link with amaze,btohqsg
Anyone can help to confirm it is counted as online payment if I am using shopback + evol card?,btohqsg
can show the amaze transaction ?,btohqsg
Amaze for me last week was 3.44 and 3.45,btohqsg
Weekend was only a spread of around 1.85% for MYR. Shouldn't be that bad leh.,btohqsg
i think the person counted wrongly the transaction rate? deleted message üòÖ,btohqsg
Actually half wrong. It is 16.85 for $4.90. But still inferior to direct use UOB lady for RM$68 to $22.28. I think for malaysia  UOB has a superior exchange. Infact XE showing $22.10 for Rm$68,btohqsg
uob still have 3.25 fcy ?,btohqsg
If they count in later when not in pending it be not as good I guess.,btohqsg
from what ppl say  is count aftrr,btohqsg
First time use UOB cc for me overseas. I use Citibank don‚Äôt have all the additional fee added,btohqsg
You haven't factor in 3.25% FX fee. And if MYR suddenly drop below 3.5 when your transaction posts then you'll feel the pain,btohqsg
Ah sorry for being a noob,btohqsg
And your original image shows RM78 not RM68. If factor in current FX rate and fees  you'll be paying $23.07  which the effective FX rate would be 3.38 instead of 3.5.Your amaze effective FX rate after spread is 3.43  which is better than 3.38 from UOB.,btohqsg
Why does citi rewards card reject the linking to amaze card,btohqsg
I just activated so maybe ill give it another day,btohqsg
Can I confirm that is possible to trsf ocbc 360 to uob 1 for the purpose of salary crediting ?,btohqsg
Am not sure how paynow works but I will think it works only where one‚Äôs paynow mobile number is tagged to ocbc bank account. If the paynow mobile is tagged to other bank and not ocbc  there is no way to trsf to uob 1 as salary payment ?,btohqsg
Instarem card spend at foreign country and if I tied to credit card  if I go to supermarket  and my UOB lady card choose grocery category  I will get the cash back   right ?And if my husband UOB lady choose dining  and we pay by Instarem for restaurant and link to his credit card will get the cash back too  right ?,btohqsg
Hihi  does this mean amaze transactions are excluded from citi rewards card?,btohqsg

Only those Amaze * ezlink/ transit basically you cannot use it for SimplyGo or EZ-Link it will not be rewardsThe rest of amaze not affect~ it a standard across many of the banks that still allow amaze transactions,btohqsg
Does HSBC EGA giro 1% cashback apply to my car loan giro deduction too?,btohqsg
