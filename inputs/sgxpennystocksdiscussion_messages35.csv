Absolute share price cannot be used to compare unless the counters have equivalent number of outstanding shares issued,btohqsg
Can la pray ug takeover medtecs tmr,btohqsg
to sgyuan i am a bit confused on SMM trendlines,btohqsg
so is it downtrend or uptrend? based on last chart?,btohqsg
At least better than volatile downward bias,btohqsg
oh ok he mentioend just now is down till 131,btohqsg
Ocbc market cap higher than uob,btohqsg
Quite true. Using market cap and the fundamental ratios to do comparison between companies that belong to the same sector. You can have 1 share that is $10 or 10 shares at $1  both will end up with the same market capitalisation,btohqsg
my chinese not bad la  from the way they write should be good,btohqsg
Aiya  good or bad tomorrow will know   sleep well n watch the show,btohqsg
« Overall  the Group is facing a challenging operating environment  given the uncertainties in the global economy and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. »,btohqsg
Turn out to be marginally better than previous year,btohqsg
Did they provide any forward guidance?,btohqsg
Will it be a ips secure,btohqsg
Result +15% after share price +350% ... end of the story,btohqsg
Seem like going to GAP down??,btohqsg
0.31 is key support level  hopefully do not break,btohqsg
There will be a technical rebound around 0.2x if it goes there  opportunity to buy and sell to cut losses,btohqsg
What’s the best strategy: sell at the open or wait a bit?,btohqsg

TA does not factor the result news  another story now,btohqsg
Vp results warning over the last weekendMonday tue price spike. All talks of a fantastic multibagger result resurfaced again,btohqsg
Didn’t even perform half of my most optimistic guesstimate,btohqsg
Yes u are right. Their margin indeed doing national service.,btohqsg
Ah At least u remembered. Thx thx,btohqsg
Many have been trapped into this  a good lesson that repeat itself: don’t touch pennies that are the last to chiong in a segment  they would have chiong earlier with others if potential is there,btohqsg
Why cannot expect skyrocketing profits? TG medtecs and such?,btohqsg
Vp should hold? Considering the not so spectacular results,btohqsg
The key isThey don’t own productsThey don’t own IPThey don’t deal with end customersThey don’t benefit fully from ASPThey got a loss making subsidiary which the original owners have to writeoff debt to give it away. All people focus on is PPE to UK,btohqsg
Results ain’t bad?It’s absolutely crappyTry earning same amount and share price up 4XLet’s see how fantastic the share price can factor in future growth expectationsNot vested not shortedJust for once hope some sanity will prevail,btohqsg
Why u got issue with me eating crab,btohqsg
U are epitome of hypocrisyAlways holding the moral high ground and sprouting to lower beings as though u are some higher one,btohqsg
My reply is in response to sky91 and not answerable to uPeriod,btohqsg
Someone mention hoping his smm to run 4000%What’s your response?Ask him see your dp. In short to shut upAnd amenThat’s really kind of u to bestow such greatness all around,btohqsg
No tinge of shame to sprout such karma stuff aroundCheers,btohqsg
Possible this will impact other medical counters?,btohqsg
Not really because it’s entity specific,btohqsg
I can only say expect the unexpected .... for VP,btohqsg
Eh don’t pull me in leh,btohqsg
Your usual reply? My day is great hope yours is too,btohqsg
Your wound? I tot u are perfectly immuned十全十美 one,btohqsg
I can stop when u stop your holy crap coz it’s been awhile and excessive,btohqsg
Good morning Hustlepeople!QOTD  :“Investing is not supposed to be easy. Anyone who finds it easy is stupid.”- Charlie MungerHave a great day ahead. Safe Trading everyone. Today should be another bullish day  especially for pennies.PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.,btohqsg
Take it easy guys  the day just started.,btohqsg
Of course those not vested must talked down on counter which they had missed the boat when supper cheap  is normal mentality lar  cheers,btohqsg
Monday Blues??? Lets not make it blue black,btohqsg
OuchAdmin personal attack coming!Or hate speech...,btohqsg
Honestly  talking up or down a stock do not really matter. Retailers cannot move market. The most a few pips. So actually  no need worry about all this.,btohqsg
So anyway  what’s the best strategy flr those who want to exit: sell at opening or wait for technical rebound then sell?,btohqsg
Today feel like a good day. Let’s keep it that way how about that. We are all here wanting to be objective and wanting to make money. That’s all,btohqsg
Hmm I thought should be based on target price instead of timing,btohqsg
Absolutely no reason to do that.,btohqsg
Let’s say opening at -20%  would you sell at opening or wait?,btohqsg
wait lah...why open -20%? Kan siao,btohqsg
Example: My target price is $1 and opening happen to be at $1  I'd just put on queue to liquidate. Nobody know for certain what will happen after market open and sure enuff there may be opportunity cost.,btohqsg
Chill everyone...money is always sensitive. Especially losing or the potential to lose. Emotions at play. Let's all be more friendly! Happy Monday all. And remember the stock market always surprises. Good result doesn't mean will go up  average result  nobody knows what till happen. Then there are those with bad results/negative equity/kena investigation (e.g kitchen) that can chiong.,btohqsg
Let's see some numbers.Without the govt grant 1.5  the net profit is 3.5mio.EPs 0.0069.65x pe at price 45c.Will investor buy something at 65x?Or rather will u buy 65x pe vicpla or maybe f&n at 12x pe.?,btohqsg
Kitchen kena investigated where got chiong. U refer to wrong kitchen izzit,btohqsg
If PE means anything  STA would have chiong!!!,btohqsg
It did it shot up before coming down again,btohqsg
Personal view P/E does not represent everything but is still one of the crucial ratio to look at,btohqsg
Must understand the fact that sta predominantly is rubber business and that segment is facing a headwind. So need to read more into tat.,btohqsg
Rubber selling has increased and its price has been rising,btohqsg
Actually kinda sad that the thai did not register STA > STGT in terms of shareholdings n other aspects,btohqsg
Anyways  let’s start the day  especially Monday with positivity. Let’s go!,btohqsg
Positivity attract profit  let have plenty of it.,btohqsg
No news on announcement by MT?,btohqsg
Well if the results are not optimal just got to admit it,btohqsg
"Bro furion is right in a sense when the price rocketed everyone spread ""false optimism"" that results are gonna be good etc",btohqsg
Anyway what we said here won't affect the stock price one.So no point arguing also.All comes down to how BBs want to play it,btohqsg
STA  Aspen  UG  RS  Medtec huat today ah  Vicplas funds will goes to there,btohqsg
I feel the issue is the tone and choice of words  he used,btohqsg
Depends on how you see it.It might be sarcastic but I find it witty.Anyway bro furion is a humorous guy if you see it in a right way,btohqsg
"That's why I keep warning on ""false optimism"" being spread here",btohqsg
I got warn abt VP alr.. not pure medical biz,btohqsg
Those that say buy VP before results see where they are now?,btohqsg
hope most took profits with the price spike last mon & tues,btohqsg
Ran up from 29 to 48 was a big leap already,btohqsg
Vp 2020 PE is 40+. Factor in a 30 to 50% increase in 2021 profit  still not cheap in PE terms.,btohqsg
VP also came down from 70cts+,btohqsg
Yes but it ran from few cents to 70+ also,btohqsg
today we switch focus to JT,btohqsg
JT is nothing... glove stocks better...,btohqsg
Will VP pull MT down ?,btohqsg
JT is under the radar. Up down not so many people care,btohqsg
I remember me and bro zane got zapped by someone regarding VP haha,btohqsg
Sorry just wondering  pre open market is there trading going on?,btohqsg
Wonder gke will do well this week.,btohqsg
haha we say must throw before results come out too,btohqsg
A 20+% gap dn is hard to stomach,btohqsg
yea... cuz u 2 bullshyt good result = will sell on news definitely,btohqsg
Well unlike you saying the results definitely will be good,btohqsg
Is the results really that bad?,btohqsg
Always be prepared for the worst,btohqsg
dont put words in ppl mouth anyhow,btohqsg
the one and only result i said will be good is STA only,btohqsg
Not bad just probably nvr meet expectations.,btohqsg
can earn profit in this bad bad times is good already ...,btohqsg
VP not that bas after all,btohqsg
Maybe I understood in the wrong way,btohqsg
Viplast gap down 8 cents. Fierce,btohqsg
i din know ur english so bad till u don't understand 'hope' means what,btohqsg
unless u hoping VP holders all lose money instead,btohqsg
just rmb if trading short term dont be blinded by self justifying w some fundamental reason esp if your reason for entry is pure PA/ technical. stay safe!,btohqsg
Lazy go post the whole story anyway it's trading time,btohqsg
Then again could be suppress price then chiong up though I think is unlikely. Cannot predict market,btohqsg
yea... post liao everyone knows how sadist you are hoping VP holders all lose big big that time right. lol.,btohqsg
Don't sell on fear first loh,btohqsg
STA and gloves all chiong today ah,btohqsg
VP holding quite well  good opportunity IMO to exit if not satisfied with the results,btohqsg
JT looking strong after the strong closing last Fri,btohqsg
"Like I say ""false optimism"" created by people here can unknowningly affect people here",btohqsg
huat ah! medtec seems to open 1 pip higher!,btohqsg
stay away VP  and focus the rest ...,btohqsg
This one must ask bro furion to dissect for you,btohqsg
unusual high volume to chiong fm 290 to 470  BB last move to get out.,btohqsg
Means BB last move to get out?,btohqsg
exit sounds better... its not a blue chip.. not worth holding.. will the med business really pick up in next 3 months too?,btohqsg
please compare the result first  Q2 already 10 times better ...,btohqsg
focus gloves sure better than most... medtec as long as vaccine not fully functional yet..,btohqsg
