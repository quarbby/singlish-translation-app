There are people who donâ€™t believe this. Oh wellâ€¦. Sigh.,btohqsg
did u ask for the MCC of the transaction?,btohqsg
wah that school sibeh old school  but yes fake,btohqsg
Hi does citi premiermiles still earn 1.2mpd If I were to tag with Amaze and purchase air tickets?,btohqsg
Hello can i check for uob one account to earn 5% is to salary giro + spend $500 only right? The 3 giro is not necessary ya,btohqsg
any recommended cards for purchasing air tickets with foreign currency charges ? miles card,btohqsg
"Try looking up ""2023 Edition: Best cards for overseas spending"" by milelion  very extensive article (looks like the HSBC Revo is the way to go)",btohqsg
yeah but HSBC Revo will be charging with bank FX rates  since the total amount is in foreign currency,btohqsg
Well.. if that's the concern why not charge it to Amaze instead ? (Not too sure which portal u buying from so... See situation I suppose ),btohqsg
btw in case it's SIA  you will be offered the option to pay with SGD if u paying by credit card  personal experience like...two days back (was under imrepssion i had to pay only in FCY),btohqsg
But if I were you  I will do payments with Amaze + a travel 4mpd or a 1.2mpd card  since  i will assume the travel ticket expense will generate quite an amount of instapoints to get the 1% cashback before it expires (2000 SGD equivalent â€”> 20 dollars cashback),btohqsg
yeah  not sure what other cards can earn same rewards as Citi Rewards  since it doesn't cover travel expenses  and also don't have a UOB lady's card.Purchasing from Ryanair website.,btohqsg
sadly its not  purchasing from Ryanair will be charge with EUR,btohqsg
Any idea if Citi Premiermiles will work with Amaze and the miles earn include travel?,btohqsg
-sigh- it's just sad UOB has to make UOB Lady's Card Female-Exclusive..Bank FCY wise sadly not much control.So it does sound like HSBC Revo against CitiPM + Amaze (yes i received miles for travel related transactions  but mainly Agoda),btohqsg
yeah ðŸ«  I suppose CitiPM might be the next best option for now,btohqsg
Can take a look at UOB VS (see it being mentioned quite often in ML)  but not something im familiar with since I don't use the card,btohqsg
how many of your think that it is important to achieve FRS before you can quit your job and FIRE?,btohqsg
Y? The payout is a pittance,btohqsg
Only comes into your budget after you put everything into cpf life and from 65 onwards to maximise monthly pension amountâ€¦,btohqsg
I think achieving FRS is a step in the right direction. In the grand scheme of FIRE  I'm sure there are much to be done before we can quit our day job (assume our day job is not what we enjoy) and do what we really enjoy.On this note  I think it is equally important to note that there are many who cannot meet the FRS when they turn 55 because of various reasons. So FRS is never ever going to be part of a silver bullet.,btohqsg
May be i suggest u play with the cpf life calculators online to see how much is the payout first?,btohqsg
because it might took me quite awhile to even max out my bhs and even to supercharge my frsbut i think it will act as a safety net when i reach 65 for the payout,btohqsg
but should one reduce their monthly investment just to fund more on cpf,btohqsg
base on what you say im guessing you are still young and also willing to take risk  so i would say no. keep investing,btohqsg
just thinking if i should to achieve BHS to supercharge my FRS,btohqsg
dont have to worry much about supercharge. i am 34 and ma only at low 40k  but i have done my calculations that my cpf balances will be very healthy in 50s and 60s cos magic of compounding,btohqsg
dont forget when you ultimately hit frs  your ma contribution will flow to oa and not sa anymore,btohqsg
Bought a house? Ot self employed,btohqsg
yes so eventually the supercharging will plateau. if you are the conservative type then topping up cpf will be a good baseline  but if can stomach more risk then go ahead with investmentd after doing your due diligence,btohqsg
this 40k is ma not oa. employee but pay only caught up in recent years,btohqsg
Hmm any exclusion MCC codes? Let me go read it now haha,btohqsg
Would you mind sharing with use the web article link? ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
I tried using dbs they didnâ€™t show amex card .. end up paying with paylah,btohqsg
QR bill payment codes on hardcopy paper bills for many months now. However code is not recognised by GrabPay at least in recent months.,btohqsg
Amex user will have it in email,btohqsg
Any recommendations for best CC for airport priority pass lounge? Dbs altitude card?,btohqsg
Strange I donâ€™t have it. Maybe check my email later.,btohqsg
I personally prefer Citi PremierMiles over altitude due to calculation blocks on miles award,btohqsg
Should be citi prestige as it gives +1 unlimited access,btohqsg
But now having promo for sign up,btohqsg
Thanks! I will go checkup on it,btohqsg
What is the MCC code for item purchase directly from Apple online store? Is the MCC same as Apple in-store purchase? By the way  for the name engraving  can it be done in-store or must place order through Apple online store?,btohqsg
possible to buy via expedia? there is 8mpd promo using uob prvi,btohqsg
Sadly the airline I'm buy not available over at Expedia,btohqsg
"I have tried several ways to transfer ""salary"" to my mom's UOB One account through Paynow and Fast. I am unable to get the salary tracker to move. Has anyone had any success?",btohqsg
I tried and it will reflect next dayMust be $1600 and indicate 'salary',btohqsg
Hm ok! I tried last night and it didn't work. Let me check again tonight! Thank you for the advice!,btohqsg
