Like on my first day  I rmb one physicist saying like,btohqsg
After working industry I realised it's actually damn cool ngl,btohqsg
"""You need to gain recognition and then if you work there for long time and you get promoted  you need to find sources of money""",btohqsg
But like I see myself as the kind that want to help ppl,btohqsg
it's not for everyone and it's important for those looking at that path to not have rose-tinted glasses,btohqsg
need to know what you're getting into,btohqsg
I hope someone can match my freak,btohqsg
Like I am more towards helping others and spreading information,btohqsg
What glasses do u wear for your perspective tho,btohqsg
I am not the kind that will go over and beyond to the point I want to get money or whatsoever,btohqsg
Like i get it given the competitive society and all but like,btohqsg
Tbh I think the spread is limited without any mass market adaptation and obv the governmental stamp,btohqsg
Yea but either ways it kinda let me lean more towards educational or education research,btohqsg
Is not that i dont like physics,btohqsg
Yea like that has been in my mind for a while tbh,btohqsg
U can do a PhD in Education if u desire,btohqsg
then look more towards science communication and where you can go towards,btohqsg
you can talk to my supervisor dr koh about education research,btohqsg
Ya once you see my lab reports  you would understand how much science communication suit me more hahahahaha,btohqsg
Can I talk to you instead? >_>,btohqsg
I just deal with excel stuff,btohqsg
"This is what happens when you kena motivated by a Russian TA who said ""you shld add more pictures to your lab report""",btohqsg
i was deciding between lab TA or a normal tutorial,btohqsg
You can try it toooo :D,btohqsg
i'm not doing it in the same sem,btohqsg
tutorial TA can clear double the hours since i took two slots,btohqsg
i basically need to clear by end of 2025,btohqsg
bc 6 months before thesis submission,btohqsg
Oh then you graduate in 2026? :0,btohqsg
Yeah he gets the cool hat,btohqsg
ok provided i manage to clear the oral defence before graduates are announced,btohqsg
sometimes they only schedule me for like july then i must wait a year for convocation,btohqsg
I need to clear FYP tho that's the pain :/,btohqsg
idk how bad your FYP is,btohqsg
Later you will hear me scream hahahaha,btohqsg

Is quite obvious when you mug your Y1 mods can get A+ and then suddenly your Y2 mods no more A+,btohqsg
Who can skip the Y1 mods,btohqsg
This is why humanities is the best,btohqsg
Oh but honestly PH1107 was the worst one I have,btohqsg
We don't discriminate based on class,btohqsg
