Some bankers must have kena whacked during MAS audits. $30k  $120k or $1.2M income  all strictly only allowed 12x monthly income for BTI.,btohqsg
Mas by right don‚Äôt regulate income above $120k.But I think maybe recently too much news of excessive debt so some lame banks decide to tighten even though Mas didn‚Äôt have such rules.,btohqsg
Two different things.1) MAS has no credit limit regulation for unsecured credit facilities for >120k income.2)MAS has BTI regulation that limits unsecured interest bearing balances to 12 months income regardless of income since June 2019.corrected per subsequent discussion,btohqsg
Any lobang to redeem posb daily$ with more value?,btohqsg
This is issued long backGuideline changes with the timesGuidelines are bare minimum so it does not mean bank cannot have a higher standard based on their own risk assessment.,btohqsg
Yeah all along no issue. Suddenly after the straits times article come out. Then banks tightened.,btohqsg
It might be the other way around.,btohqsg
Maybe need lawyer to read the Banking Law lol. Cause if go MAS website and DBS own online FAQ  there is no BTI exemptions for >120k incomers,btohqsg
You can read MAS 635https://www.mas.gov.sg/-/media/mas-media-library/regulation/notices/ppd/notice-635/mas-notice-635_for-publish-13-may-2022.pdfThere is difference in treatment if borrowers earning $120k n above.,btohqsg
lol can‚Äôt believe I scanned through 31 pages.,btohqsg
Thank you auntie! So law allows >120k. But sounds like what RS say. Maybe banks choose to be stricter.,btohqsg
Not this one. This is about not paying for 3 months üòäJust search for 120. All the different treatment pertaining $120k or certain level of assets.,btohqsg
Yup. Same spirit I guess as not paying 3 months.Basically carving out exceptions for ‚Äúthose categories‚Äù for all the rules ya?,btohqsg
MAS 635 is the go to notice for most if not all about unsecured lending,btohqsg
