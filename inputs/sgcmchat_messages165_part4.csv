Front load brake bias for maximum kek,btohqsg
wgt shit yourself beside a large lorry,btohqsg
i think the lorry can outdrag a miot,btohqsg
especially ones that have J plates,btohqsg
Depends on how much load they have and how much will to live i have tbh,btohqsg
@shitboxenjoyerhow much sleep did you get,btohqsg
Exactly FR where got power bias,btohqsg
eh wait did the NA come with open diff stock,btohqsg
Well  the base model ones did,btohqsg
94 onwards had the lsd option,btohqsg
Too late I'm on an lsd now,btohqsg
good luck driving on the roads,btohqsg
Funny thing about the lsd is no one knows what the hell it is,btohqsg
cause when you turn  your inside wheel will turn at the same speed even though it doesn't need to,btohqsg
and your will fuck up your tyres,btohqsg
and also can't power in a corner,btohqsg
locked diffs in a fwd cla,btohqsg
It was a diff he bought from a workshop  workshop say lsd  but they dk which brand.Then he take home try install cmi cuz his 1.8 auto.So he sold it on buyee,btohqsg
So long story short i have the sussiest fking diff rn,btohqsg
i guarantee 90% of the people here dk,btohqsg
but u install lsd means less slidey üòî,btohqsg
can bring me test anot i offer $1 for sit in carcar,btohqsg
$1 i go from carpark lot to the adjacent lot,btohqsg
do you have any vague idea,btohqsg
Yeah it's one of three basically,btohqsg
or is it just throw caution to the damn wind,btohqsg
people here cnfm think lsd is some turbo or what +200hp cock,btohqsg
I've narrowed it down to two brands now,btohqsg
can. u do one round of sg back to adjacent lot.,btohqsg
There's not much 1.6 lsd options  like 5. Two of them lock aggressively  so that's definitely not what i have.The remaining three brands are  OS Giken  Viscous or Mazdaspeed.It's definitely not a viscous because it locked once.So i either have an os giken or a mazdaspeed,btohqsg
$1 good deal bro i don't have much money ü•πü•πüôèüôè,btohqsg
if it's a mazdaspeed it would fit quite well with your car,btohqsg
Inb4 cusco 1.6 but iirc they lock aggressively,btohqsg
have you compared the two visually?,btohqsg
like stock images on google HAHA,btohqsg
When i sell the car it's gonna have the description,btohqsg
best offer 1.50 and a can of redbull,btohqsg
I haven't even cracked the diff open yey,btohqsg
because no one knows the fuck it is,btohqsg
Or you could put this in,btohqsg
But it‚Äôs a vert so I‚Äôll let it slide,btohqsg
Eh guys does this look like GTR or GTST R33,btohqsg
