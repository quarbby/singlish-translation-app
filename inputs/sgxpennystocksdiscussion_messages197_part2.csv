Japfa sells 80% of GreenfieldsI attach this instead of press release because this has more useful information.For a start  they sold 80% for 236m cash  nav of greenfields is 81m and they will realize a gain of 213mThey will receive a total of 244m150m will be declared as S$0.10 dividendNav will increase from S$0.62 to S$0.80Figures above without S$ are denominated in usdCongrats to shareholders of japfaGlad to see value unlocked in the exchange,btohqsg
10c dividend is a lot. Will japfa move up 10c soon?,btohqsg
0.77 give u 10ct   u say Chor or not,btohqsg
Woo hoo I vested last week,btohqsg
They only distribute some and keep around 90 mil usd. So price should increase by more than the 10 cts dividend to factor in the increased cash on hand. But this also depends how much of it already priced in prior to announcement,btohqsg
No negative news over the weekend seems today will be green again,btohqsg
Sino G extend halt to suspension FYI holders,btohqsg
"Good morning Hustlepeople!QOTD:""Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.""-Robert Louis StevensonNext up can watch for this counters.1) Vividthree ($0.068)- this one BBs have taken an interest. The recent Friday was T+4 from Monday volume spike 9000 lots but price went up instead. I added back some too but evidently  some strong hands collecting as well which brought the price up $0.063 to close $0.068 at the last minute.- looks like the start of elliot wave w5 is on the way.- safe price to enter is $0.072 and below.- possible target ðŸŽ¯ of w5 can hit $0.090 as per Master Yuan chart. However  I am aiming for $0.080 first as a lot of shares changed hands here earlier in the year. Hence  there might be more selling pressure once it reaches price level.(Do note that most of the stuckist inside this one are likely to be at $0.15 to $0.25 (IPO Price))2) AmplefieldPositive results announcements over weekend. Increase in NAV from $0.073 to $0.074Target ðŸŽ¯: $0.05 in 2021Safe Trading ALWAYS everyone.Letâ€™s go!PS: Always remember to have a cut loss in place. This will be the big difference between a small loss and a big loss that can wipe you out.",btohqsg
