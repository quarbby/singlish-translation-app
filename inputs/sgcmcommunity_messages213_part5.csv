Why do some ws want to know ur car plate when book appointment in WhatsApp?,btohqsg
If vehicle kiss till like this. Surveyor will propose change new or just patch up only?,btohqsg
New car below 1yr can change new,btohqsg
So they just gonna do patch work? Then next time my car will label as accident car?..,btohqsg
See how Ur workshop fight lor,btohqsg
Is there a portal for us to check if a car is labelled accident car?,btohqsg
Also meaning buy/sell that time very hard to determine ?,btohqsg
Only if U send for PPI,btohqsg
That time I send for PPI  they didn’t mention if it’s is or not. Like never check or mention.,btohqsg
Even if aesthetic repair  also kena label alr ah?,btohqsg
I claim him alr. Waiting for him to file.,btohqsg
Ws mechanics many times give me wrong diagnosis.,btohqsg
My car vibrate at low speed. They saw the driveshaft is abit shaky. Told me to change driveshaft.,btohqsg
Ok so what’s the right diagnosis?,btohqsg
I ownself research n find out rear tyre diameter 3% larger,btohqsg
Whut?! Then after changing the tyre the problem resolve?,btohqsg
Stupid ws with tattoo msian mechanics,btohqsg
Told me he had 20 yrs experience repair cars,btohqsg
When doing repair in his ws  he lifted my car up for 2 days. Then the coolant keep dripping on my turbo hose connection with intercooler. Stupid mechanic didn’t use a cloth to cover connection,btohqsg
If we brake because of a pedestrian illegal walking across road  then behind lorry kiss. Any way to take action on the pedestrian?,btohqsg
Which ws is that? Pm me,btohqsg
But my car just gonna be repaired by patch work. V unfair Sia. Then the padestrian just Scott free who created this mess,btohqsg
When I go highway  the whole turbo hose burst thx to the mechanic,btohqsg
I ask the mechanic to add only water into the coolant reservoir bcos I want to observe. He add water n do coolant bleeding. I ask him he bleed gum lan?,btohqsg
He say it’s necessary n want to charge me for bleeding,btohqsg
Then I tell him but Lim pei never tell u bleed leh,btohqsg
This is just 1 encounter. Usually The ws mechanics r clueless abt ur car n will not research ur car in detail to find out exact problem. They will only guess. U pay for their guess. N when repairing  they will not treat other car components carefully like preventing coolant from dripping on to other components,btohqsg
Waaaah so many stories leh you,btohqsg
The stupid mechanic see coolant drip on to the turbo hose do nothing. Let it drip for 2 days 2 nights,btohqsg
Because you don’t want let him repair and he needs to earn money. So probably he…..,btohqsg
Pedestrian is first class citizen. Max punishment he gets is TP fine for illegal road crossing. Cannot claim money for your damage.,btohqsg
means the lorry never keep safe distance ..,btohqsg
No I already given him extra job. This is nonchalant negligence. Not his car he won’t care,btohqsg
Then when he’s installing back the driveshaft  he shove the driveshaft in such a way that it punctured this,btohqsg
Extremely negligent  rough n stupid msian mechanic giving me all wrong diagnosis n damaged my turbo n control arm n did things I didn’t ask him to,btohqsg
If mechanic damaged ur control arm like this  can ask him pay?,btohqsg
If you got proof then no harm to  try,btohqsg
Pedestrians got no incentive to cross roads properly. Alot of them willing to gamble their lives away,btohqsg
When do anything in ws  better be there at all times n scrutinise everything the mechanics do n video,btohqsg
bro if ur buyer is an experienced or has frens in the industry  one look they will know one,btohqsg
Some dun consider bumper damage as accident car so long as there is no welding involved,btohqsg
I think more concerned is any welding spots,btohqsg
Lorry kiss is because lorry too close,btohqsg
Haha you should be thankful you stopped in time didn't send the pedestrian flying midair 😂😂,btohqsg
Cos went to a wrong ws and further exacerbated by returning to the same ws?,btohqsg
Can still drive to JB without VEP now?,btohqsg
