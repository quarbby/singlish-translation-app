RE: Webull transfer promo. If I apply to transfer for eg 3 counters worth USD10k each at the same from IBKR to Webull  do they arrive at webull at the same time and all 3 count as the INITIAL transfer of USD30K? I ask this because Webull only counts the first transfer to decide the tier. If the stocks do not arrive at the same time  then it will be counted as Tier 1 instead of Tier 2. I don't think the recent video covers this. Thanks.,btohqsg
