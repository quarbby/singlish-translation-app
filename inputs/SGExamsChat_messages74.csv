Go lor  adhere to the spirit of the law. 2 diff trip more infection risk or 2 possible vectors from same trip more infection risk.,btohqsg
Market failure mostly quite standard one mah,btohqsg
One of the well known one,btohqsg
sometimes come out those asymmetric  imperfect,btohqsg
2016 the market failure come out weird stuff,btohqsg
I‚Äôm sure some people wouldn‚Äôt work if they didn‚Äôt have to,btohqsg
Liability to the society an evolutionary failure and a blip,btohqsg
Last year of syllabus curveball lor,btohqsg
Ya suay lorh i kena that year,btohqsg
I'm not going to lie. If UBI is possible and the UBI itself is like 2k with option to work   I'll just nua.,btohqsg
ALSO i learnt in econs that doing housework,btohqsg
In the future they won‚Äôt need workers anyway,btohqsg
By right... by left. Solution? Exercise 9th core value.,btohqsg
There wont be a need for mathematicians jn future,btohqsg
Who got energy to moonlight in NS,btohqsg
There isn‚Äôt a need for mathematicians now,btohqsg
By that time  people would need a door in the forest r/nocontextspoilers,btohqsg
Orh. PNSF ah? Eh  actually pretty suang seh.,btohqsg

No kidding allowed in this group,btohqsg

No it's not it's just a representation designed to persuade in a certain manner,btohqsg
Honestly  NS and this CB is really making me feel disconnected,btohqsg
Some people whom I thought I would talk to alot,btohqsg
And now I'm just thinking about uni  after uni  etc,btohqsg
How will your friendship circle change,btohqsg
Making new friends is really tiring for me,btohqsg
When did you get mod lol,btohqsg
CB is making me live in my own mind,btohqsg
Instead of voiding shouldn‚Äôt they give full credit to everybody for those Q?,btohqsg
Given that there‚Äôs a bell curve  it‚Äôs the same effect anyway,btohqsg
I'm not afraid to use them!!!,btohqsg
No  bcoz different ppl allocated time differently,btohqsg
Wah then those who can do the first 27 qns how,btohqsg
By voiding  your time spent for 27 Q will not be considered as total time for exam  whereas if you allocated full cred for everybody  everybody still has the same time but if some ppl decided to spend more time on first 27 Q  it‚Äôs just your time management issue.,btohqsg
This email was sent after the exam was over,btohqsg
It's unfortunate the exam turned out this way,btohqsg
But he's a good lecturer nevertheless,btohqsg
One of the better ones üôÑ,btohqsg

I think phone repair shops are still open...?,btohqsg
Call them up before going I guess,btohqsg
Reminds me of that guy who punched his laptop,btohqsg
What got you so pissed to bounce a phone,btohqsg
I was in the middle of something and my dad went to disturb me I have a pet peeve where I really dislike it when ppl interrupt me when I am doing smth,btohqsg
uh the purple color is spreading,btohqsg
The next morning it should be full purple,btohqsg
Oh  that reminds me of when I dropped my phone,btohqsg
I was calling KFC and connect it to earpeice,btohqsg
Save all your shit if you‚Äôre not gonna fix it,btohqsg
Than I walk out and the entire phone flew off,btohqsg
I need to fix it what should I dk,btohqsg
It wil be super expensive to fix,btohqsg
Yeah just back up everything first in case you can‚Äôt fix,btohqsg
That black screen is not the black screen  it was purple ink hahaaa,btohqsg
my phone is not cracked though,btohqsg
‚ÄúThe sequence of sequences: A History of Sequencing DNA,btohqsg
When it fill the entire screen,btohqsg
I really dw change to new phone,btohqsg
At most you go look around the phone shops see if they‚Äôre open,btohqsg
nvm it's not visible but it's like forming an l shape,btohqsg
getting deep purple towards bottom of scteen,btohqsg
It‚Äôs definitely gonna take over the whole screen,btohqsg
Telegram no need cos got telegram web,btohqsg
#IphoneMasterRaceI had 3 IPhones  first 2 had experienced water damage  it somehow healed itself after awhile. The current iPhone I‚Äôm using had the exact same scenario of bouncing off the bed  a few times mind you  I‚Äôm typing this message on it. No cover btw.,btohqsg
Yours might not be so serious actually,btohqsg
if I stop using now can it be saved,btohqsg
But whether u use it or not won't affrct,btohqsg
And if the entire screen is purple  u can't even see what u type and I don't think it's touch sensitive anymore,btohqsg
U can maybe update us 3hours later on whether the purple ink get worse,btohqsg
I drop it so many times,btohqsg
I alr contacted a house to house repairman,btohqsg
I never had an iPhone haha,btohqsg
I'm not expert but defintelt can be fixed  just need at least 100+,btohqsg
I have $150 cash on hand,btohqsg
thank goodness they replied fast I just got a reply from them asking for my model number,btohqsg
Depends on where u fix also  and theres pros and con,btohqsg
this one is come to the house to fix,btohqsg
If u fix at the company u buy from  like samsung   there's waranty,btohqsg
If u send it for outside servicing,btohqsg
Ask them about price first  if reasonable than give them  don't let them take and go off  than charge u 300-400dollar when u can get a new phone,btohqsg
Tbh phone nowadays quite cheap also  300dollar can get brand new one,btohqsg
Budget iPhone  comes with wireless charging and the fastest mobile processor,btohqsg
Cheapest and best is Xiaomi  oppo  Vivo,btohqsg

Falling into the apple trap haha,btohqsg
I'm an iPhone hater  but with how the Android devices are doing at the moment  iPhone SE is a good choice,btohqsg
In what way is it better,btohqsg
I actually bought one cuz my old phone died,btohqsg
Ok  if we go flagship-wise  don't ever get the expensive ass iPhone 11 pro max  not worth the money for the features,btohqsg
Cuz she's using 5W charger that shipped in the box,btohqsg
Price to price comparison  if you compare budget iPhone SE with budget Android phone  budget Android just sucks balls,btohqsg
Depends on how low the budget android is,btohqsg
They reduce price by shipping with a shitty camera  slow outdated processors and no wireless and fast charging,btohqsg
Take the Samsung A series for example,btohqsg
Ok  u win  ure good at phones üëçüëç,btohqsg
If we're going with flagships  Android is usually better for features,btohqsg
