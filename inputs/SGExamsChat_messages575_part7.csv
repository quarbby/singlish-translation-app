my brother lecture cover in 2 or 3 hours,btohqsg
udk den its your prob le,btohqsg
poly logic gates quite basic one,btohqsg
mechanical eng dont go in depth  more of good to know,btohqsg
i was from mechanical eng so im not certain,btohqsg
my poly year 1 was like having fun with milling machine lol,btohqsg
op amps amplifier low pass filters high pass bands differential amplifier,btohqsg
not bad ah  i still cruising,btohqsg
i don't even wanna dive into that bro,btohqsg
anything that sounds like transformers don't even mention it to me,btohqsg
we got do communication system also,btohqsg
did u know transformer is a application of inductor,btohqsg
ngl its good to know info but when u do calculations damn mafan,btohqsg
especially some  even ask u use integration n differentiation,btohqsg
pretty sure u learn DC u gonna learn AC as well,btohqsg
no such thing as engineering rejects la,btohqsg
imo ah all these super hard to go in courses is already a red flag rdy,btohqsg
they telling u to not go,btohqsg
u dont test their fking water,btohqsg
2019 11 cos covid hit so hard 2020 shot up to 16 or 17,btohqsg
end of the day a gpa 2.5 in aerospace and a guy 4.0 in mech eng  u guess which one uni gonna take in,btohqsg
u will learn when u learn abt it,btohqsg
they call it operational amplifers hence opamp,btohqsg
idk abt poly but my course in uni set in a way that its all linked,btohqsg
learn abt cap and inductor at first den then tell u what is op amp,btohqsg
like the amplification of toughness is like an ideal op amp,btohqsg
555 IC is the mother of everything,btohqsg
oh shit i learnt that too,btohqsg
the stupid shark fin graph i have to draw everytime the damn voltage hits 1/3 and 2/3 of the max voltage,btohqsg
my graph look like fking penis,btohqsg
we use 555 for our lab circuit,btohqsg
wah must be quite fun leh,btohqsg
haha i had a projects where i was given 2 circuit board,btohqsg
not fun when the prof ask u fked up questions,btohqsg
im actually considering to go NUS ngl,btohqsg
either in exams or preparing for exams,btohqsg
im not having a good time,btohqsg
