🎙US Government Shutdown - A risk in September on the Horizon⏳The Congress is now in recess. When they return in September  the musical begins  and one can expect a showdown by each party as they wrestle on the agenda along partisan lines.Wait a minute  isn’t that drama over? Indeed  that’s what many of our readers felt. So we thought it might be helpful to give you a premiere insight into what could go wrong. Indeed  the prior party fight rests upon approving the debt ceiling  which is to fund programs that were already approved.📠The context of the situation🔦Now  Congress will be confronted with reaching a consensus to authorise spending bills to keep the government functioning. The challenge is that they have only a few weeks to reach an agreement  and it appears to be a daunting task.🧯Impact of missing consensus🩺The failure to reach an agreement may lead to direct and indirect economic impacts. Contract workers are most vulnerable and may not receive their salary. This may weaken their disposable income and have ramifications for economic growth. You can imagine the ripple effects.Looking back at the 2019 government shutdown  about 800 000 workers were affected. According to Morgan Stanley research  a government shutdown will chip off 0.05% of GDP growth every week. While this seems tiny  the compounding and ballooning momentum can quickly escalate.🧰 4 Hurdles that deviate from the right path🔫Why is Congress not actively working to reach an agreement? There are some key reasons.1. Congress faced multiple negotiation challenges  and such complexity often deters a smooth outcome.2. Within the Republican party  there seems to be a debate on the right level of government funding; hence  unless the in-party can unite to conclude their wishlists or reach a position  it’s like a civil war within a community.3. Again  the Republican party seems to be divided on the level of support for Ukraine.4. Finally  in recent years  there has been a growing desire for political parties to prolong standoffs to squeeze the last drip of essence out of each other despite polls often reflecting poorly on both parties. It is a lose-lose proposition  but that’s how politics run today.Should we get worried? Probably not yet  but keep it in your rear view  as once the chatter begins  the waves of volatility may rise again.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃,btohqsg
