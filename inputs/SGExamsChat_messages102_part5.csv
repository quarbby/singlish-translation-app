Quizarium has been not here for years,btohqsg

Is this some kind of poly joke that I'm too elitist to understand,btohqsg
The petition didn‚Äôt talked about ITE,btohqsg
Maybe its a secret elite chat,btohqsg

Hi sorry anyone can humour me with a question I have? Any possibility for an SIT graduate to make it to MOE to teach?,btohqsg
Garmen is good grades = go in,btohqsg
Anyway you'll need a PGDE to teach,btohqsg
So after SIT you'll need go NIE,btohqsg
Yeah as in get into NIE,btohqsg
I don't see why not as long as your grades make it,btohqsg
But just because you get pdge doesn't mean you'll get into MOE,btohqsg
then what do people do if they don't get into moe teaching then,btohqsg
i heard of first class honours who failed the interview stage,btohqsg
u can consider private tutoring as an alternative if u are rly keen in teaching,btohqsg
That's why ppl go for education scholarship,btohqsg
Cause that means accepted by moe alr,btohqsg
but ofc entering MOE solidifies ur stand in the education industry,btohqsg
Or it just allows you to say Ex MOE teacher,btohqsg
You can always become private tutor,btohqsg
ahhh right okay that makes sense,btohqsg
hmm okay alright thanks guys for humouring my question,btohqsg
Anyway education isn't really the best place to go,btohqsg
If u got no passion yea,btohqsg
My jc teacher told me that many students want to be teachers cause that's the only job they've seen,btohqsg
I do suppose there's a bit of truth in this,btohqsg
Dealing with primary school children sucks,btohqsg
And dealing with primary school children in the form of adults also suck,btohqsg
i was trying to think of a pun with your misspelling of principle but i just want sleep now,btohqsg
