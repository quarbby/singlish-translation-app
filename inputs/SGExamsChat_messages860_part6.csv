the only time I feel touch screen is useful is if you are reading pdfs on the train or something like that,btohqsg
Most of our notes now is digital,btohqsg
if you are comfortable with the keyboard  keyboard typing is much faster.,btohqsg
Ye im gonna use my own mechanical keyboard,btohqsg

Ohh coz my Poly laptop bought with financial help uh,btohqsg
Actually if you tech savvy you can permanently extend trial of software without cracking the software,btohqsg
idk bout poly but for me in ITE you can use the ITE Opportunity fund to get a laptop and ITE will subsidy 80% of it (that 80% must not exceed $1 100),btohqsg
Like if you run virtual machines on your computer   install the trial software on vm   once the trial expires you create another vm and repeat the process,btohqsg
like having to install trial software can be like 2 to 3 gigs,btohqsg
To me ... no trial software is trial   more like permanent unless they require user account verification,btohqsg
In Poly  we got a similar system too just that the laptop will be subsidised by the Poly to some extent.,btohqsg
