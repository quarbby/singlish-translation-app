Yesterday  22 December 2023  was a test for me 1st incident:1st order of the day  accepted order and as usual  I‚Äôll call customer to confirm the item and determined the size of the item as my thermal bag is small(22L).Based on LLM guideline of 40cm x 25cm x 25cm  slightly larger still ok as long I can manage.Immediately proceeded to PU point after confirmation with customer.Upon reaching outside customer‚Äôs house  saw fellow rider carrying white carrier bag  I checked at the shoe rack and didn‚Äôt see the white carrier bag as mentioned by customer earlier on  immediately I called the other rider to check with him  he was from Grab. We checked and confirmed it‚Äôs the same item. Not his fault though. Confirmed it‚Äôs a double booking.ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èCalled customer but didn‚Äôt answer and suddenly job was missing(hmmmm)..I calm myself and texted LLM hoping for a compensation  but communicating with their ‚Äúhuman‚Äù is so draggy that I opt to ignore and move on with other job order.But definitely after ‚Äúeducating‚Äù the customer via WhatsApp voice note.2nd incident:Tried calling customer 3 times for confirmation but no answer. Texted her via LLM apps  but still no reply.While waiting  I was liaising with another customer.The latter called and with a high tone  asking me what time will I reach her place  as she noticed I was stationary.I told her of LLM procedure of confirmation with customer.Obviously she‚Äôs not taking it  and said that she definitely know her item is ok  that‚Äôs why she book LLMüôÑ. Reminded her again on LLM procedure upon accepting a job.This time she said that she doing LLM also and knows the procedure. Told her that ‚Äògood‚Ä¶.the more she should know the procedure‚Äô.As not to lengthen the argument  I told her that I‚Äôll just cancel the order.Requested LLM to cancel this job but took them about 2 jobs to remove the cancelled job from ‚Äòongoing‚Äô.Sorry for the lengthy post.I‚Äôll use this to copy paste to ‚Äúshare‚Äù with LLM.üò¨Have a great weekend everyone!!,btohqsg
Actually like that case don take the job so far not worth,btohqsg

"I didn't take..it was a lalamove desperate attempt cause no one took. So they just call drivers randomly in attempt to ""assign to u"".I in Changi  how to reach pickup at Jurong in 15mins?LLM seems like randomly calling  hope some poor fella accept it  then push the blame to the fella that he is late for pickup.",btohqsg
Anyone have any idea why it‚Äôs $40 and Lalamove added $16?,btohqsg
Cause this period sometimes their order stuck and no driver pick up so they put that amount fixed at $40 to make driver see the order and swipe,btohqsg
If not their orders stuck they also need add tips become the same,btohqsg
Only this period only the price good later after finish chrismas go normal back already,btohqsg
Who picked up this items üòÇ,btohqsg
Please drive a cold store over and ask them sit in the fridge,btohqsg
Haha earlier I check high demand grab 38,btohqsg
Y now here like job adverts space. Lol,btohqsg
Anyone working for Qxpress? It is scumbag. The couriers either steal parcels or they are so overworked that they mark item as delivered/attempted twice (with bad photo evidence - blackout photo  and wrong unit number photo),btohqsg
Makes all of us here saints who do the job properly,btohqsg
Guys need some advice. Yesterday night doing delivery parked below block to unload. Less then 15mins car got vandalised I think with paint thinner,btohqsg
Anybody got cheap spraypaint to recommend,btohqsg
Do you guys always call the customer to confirm the item and check the size after accepted the order?,btohqsg
How you know is thinner and was there a vehicle beside you when you parked?,btohqsg
Oh ya la paiseh i see the residue now,btohqsg
Walao eh this person who vandalise your car really cb eh if vehicle is day rental habis.,btohqsg
Ya me too  unless cannot find the shop then I‚Äôll call,btohqsg
Actually is probably cause I block the pavement pathway,btohqsg
So probably one the neighbours lo,btohqsg
Is either thinner or paint remover,btohqsg
Tmr go respray lo $520 shag,btohqsg
Wah they fucking Cb say real,btohqsg
Now increase to 40 x 30 x 30 already,btohqsg
But people still order couriers for pizza lol which is too big to fix into the bag,btohqsg
IKR‚Ä¶ü§£One of the reason I called to confirmed.,btohqsg
This table is what LLM shared with me during my recent cancellations,btohqsg
How they able to place this kind of dirt cheap order,btohqsg
How does that price even go through?,btohqsg
Take the order.. wait until melted then deliver..,btohqsg
But for them to go up  get thinner  come down  also need time. Unless u really park super long.,btohqsg
Wanna ask i engage van for delivery.. will the driver help to load/unload item? And can one person tag along?,btohqsg
Should be those first floor unit,btohqsg
Cause the walkway to the road Is infront of their house,btohqsg
But it's a proper loading/unloading bay right?,btohqsg
The loading bay 2 lots already taken,btohqsg
So I parked in front of them,btohqsg
But made sure they can turn out,btohqsg
Oh.. Then maybe lo. Maybe always loading bay full then people always park that empty space nearby blocking their pathway.,btohqsg
Is there a hotline to contact LLM?,btohqsg
It's what I see on website,btohqsg

This guy 8 boxes of seafood he estimate 3kg each alr 24 kg I tell him car max weight 20kg he say nvm can fit inside car I say Lalamove policy he dont care ok lor let some other poor guy take lor,btohqsg
8 stops 8 boxes of seafood hahaha the Edward guy holding the package also Sibei rude,btohqsg
Do business wanna scrimp on delivery lol joke,btohqsg
The pickup guy kpkb me say he dk what‚Äôs in the box dk how heavy he dk anything  come now or he going to leave alr,btohqsg
Then the person who order call me and tell me can fit inside car,btohqsg
I think probably because this vendor had done deliveries before so that‚Äôs why he dare say that,btohqsg
ask him cancel dont go lalan and do bro touch wood u bang car $1000k gone ready no point this amount $50 island wide delivery,btohqsg
They should show us customer rating,btohqsg
So we can see the problem ones haha,btohqsg
lol  frozen food with so many location and he book a sedan instead of a cold store. damn risky.out of 8 locations  surely 1 will already be spoilt by the time you finish all deliveries. and that 1 spoilt delivery is enough to take away all your earnings and deposit  since it is 3kg seafood,btohqsg
"not worth. and it's sealed somemore  maybe already got hidden ""spoilt"" box. u don't even know.",btohqsg
This one how much the order?,btohqsg
Sender should've used another platform like pickupp or uparcel better,btohqsg
This cheapo have doing for long time to bring back chicken from woodlands  try explain to her but still never change,btohqsg
So she mean from Tampines to Woodlands then go back Tampines?,btohqsg
wtf. I think because she pay you $40.30 that why she expect that kind of service.,btohqsg
From woodlands to tampines how far? $8 doolars enough?,btohqsg
Then like that must double the rate ah. At least $80 for back to back,btohqsg
Walao eh lke this also can ah. So many pattern i see üòÖ,btohqsg
She though return trip is like that,btohqsg
If me i just do Tampi to Woodlands then complete job üòÇ,btohqsg
If she want return trip book another trip,btohqsg
Customer who likes to put return trip  but never put final address,btohqsg
Later got a complaint LLM deduct your money,btohqsg
Just complete the job at woodlands. Its justified üòÜ cause end location is woodlands mah. Now tamp,btohqsg
apparently they should book tamp - woodland - tamp + the round trip service,btohqsg
Hmm she can complain but she never state need return trip in the app as black and white,btohqsg
Usually i take round trip service  if they put tamp - woodland  woodland is my last stop. Even app ask u to complete there,btohqsg
So go back for what hahahaha,btohqsg
thats why. We just follow what app say ma. Thats how we are paid. Anything outside app is not our problem alrwady,btohqsg
Yup. When u at woodland  need take pic of drop off. After that no more steps to follow,btohqsg
Been doing this everytime i take round trip jobs. Reach end location i call the pick up to either book another order to come back or paynow extra,btohqsg
Sohai llm never teach their cx how to book properly,btohqsg
Dont forget give bad rating for this sender bro.,btohqsg
Sorry I didn't take this job  someone took it,btohqsg
because this affect our routing if we stack job.,btohqsg
I took on first booking  she cancel then someone took it,btohqsg
I always thought that's how it works,btohqsg
Like return trip just add $8 üòÇ,btohqsg
Aft Christmas past 2 days order price like shitüòÇ,btohqsg
What you mean? If Round Trip Sure STATED in the Booking,btohqsg
For example  round trip tamp - woodland.,btohqsg
At woodlands u are at the drop off  u take pic and follow the steps cause u drop off already  app will direct u to completion,btohqsg
Doesnt take a genius that customer is required to put pick up location - drop off location - and final drop off location for round trip,btohqsg
If drop off at woodland already and still do the round trip to tamp  but ur app completed  ur not insured,btohqsg
If roundtrip no need input address. But i think round trip is only for documents,btohqsg
Would u wanna risk it? Anything happen to u or the parcel when on the way back to the first pick up location  how?,btohqsg
Hahhaa nowadays my round trips send laptop/hp for servicing  clothes exchange etc2,btohqsg
But if rlly round trip llm say no need put end location,btohqsg
I always wonder who will take round trip,btohqsg
Siao the time I used for that trip I could do another trip,btohqsg
Say u r not insured from woodland back to tamp,btohqsg
Wa but they confirm livechat llm,btohqsg
Then stupid llm gonna deduct my credit ahain,btohqsg
Apparently in LLM alot of gundus. $6-$10 also they take. Overweight also take. Customer make them wait at restaurants also they take,btohqsg
Cause of kuniang drivers/riders. All job they do,btohqsg
Round Trip sometime Involve Items or Food Also. No matter what. We always Loss Endsüò¢üò¢,btohqsg
Yea best all of us just avoid round trips hahaha,btohqsg
So they bobian have to book separately,btohqsg
But Sometimes ALL must See as I Notice some got But Special Request and Payment SINGLE trip only. If you take they don pay we Suck thumb,btohqsg
End of the day  the one at fault is rider/driver,btohqsg
Cause u all go do. Llm see  llm find that ‚Äúokay this is do-able so no need to change‚Äù,btohqsg
Till today still got people taking 6-10 stops per order w lowball price,btohqsg
Some still take the western union job,btohqsg

Depends. Some got Remarks NOT allow stacking. So must see,btohqsg
"So far most of them leh when i take job. Always say ""Deliver this first"" or ""you got no other order right""",btohqsg

Yes sometimes not accurate. best to double check before moving off,btohqsg
A few times it happened to me but not often,btohqsg
Usually is new condo/HDB or industrial areas that have this issue,btohqsg
Not sure if the wrong address issues affect payout price? üò±,btohqsg
Postal Code sometimes can Miss 1 Big Roud as some Condo is Beside Gate so GPS Put enter small Gate. Best is Check Full Addresz or Name of Codo more Accurate,btohqsg
Yes yes.. Last Thursday I kena one at punggol. Postal code 828685  it brought me to hdb. Instead it‚Äôs a condo named The terrace.,btohqsg
Knn make me go one big round,btohqsg
I message the sender asked her to input full address next time for more accurate location but she replied LLM app only requested postal code and unit number only,btohqsg
Now only I know why I always see only postal code and unit number only in LLM app when accepting order.,btohqsg
Especially if condo  no condo name only postal code,btohqsg
And some condo name is different from the one that you see in app,btohqsg
You go Try Bukit Timah. Miss Entrance have to UTurn Opp then UTurn Back. The Turn To And Fro NOT short distance alsoüôÉüôÉüôÉ,btohqsg
Wah jialat waste time waste petrol,btohqsg
The default navigation i set to use google map.. anyone know how to reset the thing?,btohqsg
I didn‚Äôt find any in LLM setting,btohqsg
9 out of 10 courier jobs and they ain‚Äôt up-ing the price‚Ä¶..tsk‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Ya sometimes it happens.. Abit irritating,btohqsg
I realise the maps not good with condo. Always take me to the hdb beside it and then need to go one big round again,btohqsg
Tmr back to low ball fares again,btohqsg
Anyone meet a order forBuy for me with big tips?,btohqsg
Just curious if car drivers can go to loading/unloading bay in malls?,btohqsg
Now customers try their best to cheap driver,btohqsg
actually ah... got such thing already because LLM collab with Aftershock as their project. I did one of the project before. Deliver PCs.,btohqsg
It is too obvious  one big trolley with 8 boxes,btohqsg
Mine was $40 plus also 4 drop off.,btohqsg
but your one i think need van la this one,btohqsg
walao eh Jurong Port some more,btohqsg
Jurong Port Rd need pass to go in.,btohqsg
Will probably take a few days break and see if the situation still the same.,btohqsg
If no improvements just go get a permanent job with CPF,btohqsg
You do full time or PT,btohqsg
Today LLM rates v v low,btohqsg
20 dollars round trip Jurong east to Sim lim square,btohqsg
Don't deliver if prices ridiculous low,btohqsg
I stayed home and spent time with family.,btohqsg
Im transitioning into full time soon. Kena retrenched by my company,btohqsg
Maybe because of the 9% GST that already started ,btohqsg
I think things will pick up in the net few days,btohqsg
December was all the Xmas and NY deliveries,btohqsg
I think better to do PT while finding a FT job that comes with CPF,btohqsg
ya that is what i doing,btohqsg
I saw online people doing grab food deliveries also can earn 8000 a month why are we even doing llm sia wtf,btohqsg
HAHAHA! It‚Äôs our own choice mahh Bro?  We choose to do it on our own terms and conditions. If you think GrabFood can do better  don‚Äôt wait.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm reconsidering why I‚Äôm still doing Lalamove,btohqsg
If even riding bicycle sending food can earn more,btohqsg
Grabfood low overhead and running cost. No need petrol and almost zero maintenance cost,btohqsg
LLM also collab with QExpress for parcel deliveries FYI. So every now and then they will offer this project to us. Can earn $300 per day someting like that,btohqsg
Bicycle $8000 a month confirm cannotU try riding 5 hours a day under sun and rain$8000 a month grabfood illegal ebike mod maybe,btohqsg
Think be careful of QExpress. Seems like they got way too many orders to meet delivery timeframe. You see the Google reviews... I also kena from them as a customer when I never receive parcel / they lied they deliver but actually never  and many times,btohqsg
Guys has the express project started?,btohqsg
They had 1 just last week but ended already. But they say the app will prompt again if anyone interested,btohqsg
Notice that for the price breakdown for long journeys. Sometimes LLM include everything as Delivery Fee. While sometimes it is Base Fare + Distance Fee,btohqsg
Hahahah it's like low peak fare,btohqsg
Worth it mehh? Slog so hard?,btohqsg
But mostly all rhe orders I did today bike,btohqsg
I was on for 4 hours I got $180 on UParcel. ü§£,btohqsg
I did stack with short Roo trips along the way. So about $240 thereabouts. üòÇ cannot always depend on LLM or just one platform.,btohqsg
Uparcel delivery is same as llm?,btohqsg
Like one pick up one drop?,btohqsg
Depends on the sender sometimes can be more than 1.,btohqsg
On paper it says 20%  but it varies between 18%-20% when I calculate back.,btohqsg
I go take a look haua,btohqsg
True ah more platforms more options,btohqsg
yup uParcel take 20% comm but food delivery is ridiculous only $7 ü§£,btohqsg
Cluster job not bad  all Tampines,btohqsg
This means 11 drops at the same block?,btohqsg
I can PM you contact person,btohqsg
Hi goodmorning  I just registered for an bike account  how long does it take to process? Is 1-3days? Is the delivery by zone like FP or islandwide,btohqsg
Process can be fast can be slow also. Depend.,btohqsg
Delivery you can setting in the app if you want islandwide or specific area like north  south etc.,btohqsg
No auto assign one. Need to choose job and choose fast,btohqsg
price keep coming down but loads is getting up  ridiculous here,btohqsg
Use car use bicycle confirm cannot after minus costMaybe motorbike and illegal bike can,btohqsg
Tdy payments not in yet ya,btohqsg
Yes cannot do llm soon. The car  price close to courier price,btohqsg
Eh one order need wait 30-45 mins,btohqsg
Enjoy the exploitation of labours. Proudly present by llmüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Eh guys. Dont forget claim your $500 CDC voucher 2024,btohqsg
Riders  is this a justifiable amount for the distance pls?,btohqsg
Only if small and light item  non food  and not urgent delivery,btohqsg
Problem is no pic no description,btohqsg
Isit recommended to get the lalakit?,btohqsg
I personally wouldn't take it üòÖ super long distance and after commission  it's not a lot left..,btohqsg
Yeah my thoughts lean towards that too. Too low for that far.,btohqsg
Only thing that's good for me is because it's near home at destination so idm,btohqsg
Unless really not much order or it's on the way home,btohqsg
If not I think I rather do 2 x $10 short distance  which is still damn pathetic ü§£,btohqsg
Ahhhh yes  unless it‚Äôs headed back towards home or somethin then it‚Äôs fine. Or even for the last stackable slot.,btohqsg
Stopped doing since the year started. It was the plan  but after seeing these kind of fares... No incentive to do lol,btohqsg
Any other good plateform other then llm?,btohqsg
Gogovan  ixpress  uparcel can do but bulk of job still in lalamovePickupp a bit pointless due to lack of jobsViamove don‚Äôt waste ur time. Got $0.05 to negative earnings job  i don‚Äôt know wtfGrabexpress  Ninjavan  Qxpress and amazon flex i havent tried,btohqsg
Recently llm prices too chui   need to venture n see other plateform alr,btohqsg
Where to sign up for ixpress?,btohqsg
Ixpress usually only town have orders,btohqsg
U got take the zero comission?,btohqsg
Well said bro LLM still the biggest share,btohqsg
But doesn't earn enough at all. FactIf u drive a van   how much can u make from lalamove? We all know. Tbh a van job which needs u to carry heavy loads with big trolley  with 15km of driving earns abt 2 tiny stack panda food orders. Pandacars from pandamart normally have stack orders or 3 to 4. Close distance. Which is faster and save more energy for a better tmr?,btohqsg
Dont need do the premium plan.Not a lot of jobsJust try the free one first,btohqsg
Car drivers normally will end up doing grab or gojek. Follow the money,btohqsg
Even less than courier price for other platforms. Totally abuse of labour   exploitation of drivers  insult drivers intelligence. Take away petrol   car expenses by proportion to time spend  driver is only being paid at most 4 dollars an hour if this is the rate. Do your maths before taking orders  otherwise they will keep lower it.,btohqsg
worst still touch wood meet accident since u ride so far and more time spending on the road llm doest even covered the losses bro for $13 end up u loss more than thousands million times causes this the fact bro happened ready before,btohqsg
I still see orders with base fares and drivers still snatching it. Ridiculous indeed.,btohqsg
Then don‚Äôt come crying ‚ÄúWhy fares so low?‚Äù. Pfft!,btohqsg
That kinda fare is for stacking nia  cannot be solely one job  cannot earn one,btohqsg
Llm keep dropping the price since 2018 from from all vechicle till now u got $10 net less more ready what u get now guys pls use u brain also apply on me common llm i dared u drop till $20 nets priced what we get now i ready am waiting.,btohqsg
Best to undercut their customers. A lot are also willing to do that.,btohqsg
All orders will be $1 $3 $5 changi to jurong lol will be better common llm i dared u,btohqsg
or $5 too expensive for customers maybe $4 max lol,btohqsg
changi airport to tuas south $4.,btohqsg
uParcel food delivery standard $7 regardless where.,btohqsg
not now soon on llm..now there working on it..lol,btohqsg
but after must delivered in hour time ya if not get banned.,btohqsg
Anyone doing Foodpanda or Grab food delivery car driver? How is it? I cannot do Private hire yet havent 30 years old lol,btohqsg

true bro  im old mercured enough ready on working bro  told u i even got pdvl license bro,btohqsg
Hi goodmorning  how do we submit proof of delivery ah? Ps first order today. Will it appear once I drop off?,btohqsg
Knn today llm price like shit even raining time customer still book courier pangsai,btohqsg
Ever since after christmas period over,btohqsg
Once you accept job  press call customer and there is option to call customer or press the arrow for GPS. There will be orange bar that says arrived but do that only when you pick up the items already and need pic as proof.After that  same thing  press call customer to get to GPS and once arrived  press the orange bar and it will prompt confirm drop off? Press yes and it will bring you to take pic for POD or customer sign,btohqsg
I see everyday price cannot man,btohqsg
time are really harder now for those youngsters  sg news already out half million sg young locals are having mental issue now or willing to attempt suicidal that fact and sad bro,btohqsg
Okok thankyou so much. I forget to press pickup just now üòÇ,btohqsg
I seldom call. I normally use message,btohqsg
Cos one time driver over alr,btohqsg
They ask me show call log,btohqsg
I never call but got msg they say cannot,btohqsg

What are you still doing here? With the current market I suggest you get a full time job. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Later want to buy house how  if got not much CPF?,btohqsg
True. If you 30 yo go take up full time job that you can learn a skill.,btohqsg
Even a tower crane operator at construction site can earn between 6 to 8k and it‚Äôs a skill that‚Äôs more useful than delivery,btohqsg
Llm is PartTime ok. Full you have to think of Car Maintain  Rental Etc. Unless You Golden Spoon For Life. Now Private Hire they may start CPF Deduction for Certain Age. Find Full-Time or take Up Skills MORE Better,btohqsg
Many Boost PHVs Daily $500K mahü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Can rent from hdb no down payment or instalment to worry,btohqsg
Renting means you don‚Äôt have an asset that appreciates. When retire or older will not be able to benefit,btohqsg
A hdb house is never an asset in the first place as it is on a leasehold and a liability,btohqsg
If you buy a house left 50 years. 20 years later you think it will appreciate in value?,btohqsg
Hdb market will crash when left 20-30 years nobody will buy,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it the same for older condos unless enbloc,btohqsg
If freehold or 999 then it‚Äôs a different story,btohqsg
yup. Those 80s condo is spacious and very valuable today,btohqsg
New condos are so pathetic in sq ft,btohqsg
The developers are laughing their way to the bank,btohqsg
99 years condo will also depreciate. Maybe after 30 years when closer to balance 60 years. Also the cost of maintaining it will go up.,btohqsg
Yes it doesn‚Äôt make sense spending 4-5 million on a 99 years condo like reflection harbourfront,btohqsg
Not with the current interest rate and downwards rental prices,btohqsg
Actually is about $800k daily. Not sure where u get the 500k from,btohqsg
Need to be on the road at least 4 hours just to cover rent and fuel,btohqsg
Now phv and lala price very bad... last time lala do still can stack. Now like every customer dont allow stacking. Pay so low for express service.If can stack lala still pays more,btohqsg

Can I ask if it's worth it to work weekends for lalamove on a motorcycle? How much can one earn on average?,btohqsg
depends on how long you work. Abit hard to say because i not a rider üòÖ,btohqsg
Worthwhile advice. But have you ever stacked 2 yellow and 2 orange back to back?üòÖ,btohqsg
can the vibration for new orders be turn off?,btohqsg
lol lucky no aqua or gay customers here yet if not comment there can i take ride with or moving free upon free one time service to driver instead of payment lol..,btohqsg
So between grab govan uparcel llm all these  which is best as a motorcycle rider?,btohqsg
Llm and uparcel good mix easier to stack cause both platforms you pick your own jobs. Grab assigns the job so harder to multi.,btohqsg
Govan very very very few orders for motorcycle. Can't be your main platform.,btohqsg
urpacel alone for van can earn $300 tommorrow ?,btohqsg
if i decide to drive a van. Can i just enter shopping mall loading bay easily for collection or delivery?,btohqsg
Just to avoid the hassle of the carpark,btohqsg
Ya‚Ä¶.but some malls have a differed charge for loading bay compared to carpark. Normally it‚Äôs more.,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt you book for a car then?,btohqsg
How the buy for me service goes anyone know?,btohqsg
No la not all scam.. some is legit,btohqsg
Those usually add $300 tip that only scam,btohqsg
now all people getting broke and broke if lala cs also broke now dream on,btohqsg
Do we charge customer for any erp?,btohqsg
I read from llm apps they have to paynow or transfer to driver first before we proceed correct?,btohqsg
Issit? But u ever do that?,btohqsg
Tried yesterday bt customer ask  me buy for him use my own money first because he choose cash payment..,btohqsg
This one not sure...mybe u can live chat with llm cs,btohqsg
No go bro. If customer never pay you will be huge cockup bro.,btohqsg
Ya that's why I ask him to  cancel the order,btohqsg
Call the number hp off...then ws me using +62 Indonesia number,btohqsg
Just now took one paid by creditüòÖ,btohqsg
Customer has to transfer the full amt u for the purchase  never unfront the payment  for them or top up whatever card.Llm did mentioned in the video training  do not proceed the order if customer refuse to pay before purchase. But some gundos still fall for it.,btohqsg
I let the cus know about this..bt he keep on saying that one if only cus on paynow mode,btohqsg
Tell cus u no money ask him/her to cancel the order. Don't waste time with these people,btohqsg
Think if got Xar Park chargez can ask but Depends if pax want pay?,btohqsg
Yap. AGREE. Cos if you buy and they DENY. You suck thumb and Waste your own moniez. Some are Loan Shark cases too. So Best NOT to take such Buy thingz job,btohqsg
Hi new bird here  may I know can we take 2 orange order at the same time?,btohqsg
Now or scheduled? If you wanna stack  at your own risk. If customer complains  you better have a solid answer. Don‚Äôt give a peak period jam or traffic jam excuse. Expired excuses liao.,btohqsg
Customer are paying peanuts and don‚Äôt want us to stack,btohqsg
Riders  this can take? About 5kg,btohqsg
Got once i tio really PIE accident massive jam  CS want me to stoo roadside take photo and as another driver come take,btohqsg
In the end donate half of fee to llm üôÉ,btohqsg
Anyone kena speeding at sentosa while doing LLM before? Acci exceed by 11km/h was travelling at 51 at a 40km/h roadHow much is the fine? Any chance to appeal?,btohqsg
1st time offenders 4 demerit points and $150 fine but usually if 1st time usually will kena stern warning only.,btohqsg
Yeah 1st time kena didnt notice the 40km/h. Always tell myself not to take sentosa LLM but today hand itchy,btohqsg
then dont worry will kena warning only. Just wait for letter and appeal online.,btohqsg
Luckily you exceed 11km/hr is within the ok range,btohqsg
above 20 is straight fine and demerit,btohqsg
Hahah i only notice the white small flashes aft i passed then i knew i kena already,btohqsg
Customer also choose to stay all the way inside need to cruise at 40 üòÇ,btohqsg
Normally u all do one by one or stack. Because feel that one by one safer than do stack.,btohqsg
So far i 1 by 1 still noob haven‚Äôt do stack yet,btohqsg
Depends what item and how far,btohqsg
Because I not van is car and part time not full time so should be ok.,btohqsg
Agree. Also MUST see Remarks as some STATED NO Stack. Unless its Very Near,btohqsg
I saw the sentosa order capella one,btohqsg
Is it the manor villa one right?,btohqsg
Don care Part-Time Or Full-Time. Mistake they DON care. Also must see some Condo like Maze. You think very Fast later Lost your 2nd Delivery TIO Complain. Also DON accept Last minute order even you nearby or later CS will ask you why Late and even you say the Oder Last minute. They tell you if can take if NOT just don Bother cos Once you take you answer liaoüôÉüôÉüôÉ,btohqsg
Price now not so nice and good,btohqsg
I kanna before. Only fine no demerit,btohqsg
Ya man. I just kena complain by oddle. They want it delivered by 12pm but when I accepted the order it‚Äôs already 12+. Now need appeal.,btohqsg
So the order over there long alr,btohqsg
Ya it has happened many times. But I mean the complain part  how come they can‚Äôt reflect in the timing accepted and timing arrived at collection point?,btohqsg
So how can the complaint be valid?,btohqsg
Not sure how they managed to complain. I only can appeal by telling llm to check their system timing because there‚Äôs no evidence for me to upload at all,btohqsg
Oddle if u guys see the tips plus $8  $10 $16 already  take screenshots of job before  during   after and ur maps timingThey always play stunt like that. I kana before. Appeal successfullyOne tip is to check the time they write in the notes before u accept. If its way past delivery time and high tips need be careful.Even if u deliver the customer will complain as they thought we are oddle. Then oddle will complain to lalamove. Thats how it works,btohqsg
I tio then next day take just nice vendor delay,btohqsg
I purposely stayed longer and claimed oddle late fees üòÇüòÇ got back my donation,btohqsg
Ya. Regret taking. Once i turn out from capella then wanted to do u-thrn kena because downslope and missed the 40 speed limit sign,btohqsg
Stack is ok but must do smart and on the way. Oddle and 1hr alcohol delivery better don‚Äôt try.,btohqsg
Possible. Thats whyif URGENT or Past Collection NOT take as llm will say Driver lateüò¢,btohqsg
Hi goodmorning! May I know what's the difference between car and courier job scope ?,btohqsg
Size of items and price of delivery,btohqsg

Everytime I take oddle order  I give them 1 star,btohqsg
Hi bosses what's oddle order ?,btohqsg
Food order bro. Much like Grabfood or FP,btohqsg
Ohhhhh . Cos I see apps most of the time got this oddle order,btohqsg
But sometime I got pick until food order but not under oddle .,btohqsg
Yes can be true also. Those are probably home-based food businesses or it could be that they don‚Äôt have Oddle platform to begin with.,btohqsg
Ohhhh finally I know what oddle mean already thank you sir üôèüèª,btohqsg
But oddle is mostly pick up from shop ? Or house also,btohqsg
Ohhh oddle order v strict also .All of them cannot have stack order must pick and deliver straight,btohqsg
If can I always wait till they give high high tips then I take,btohqsg
Want deliver food but use Lalamove then kbkp cannot stack,btohqsg
Ikr‚Ä¶ even Grabfood stack order sia,btohqsg
Any lao jiao here doing llm using bike part time? Advise to maximum income? TIA,btohqsg
Multi app with grab express and llm,btohqsg
4me grab more worth it for bike,btohqsg
Now driver can cancel order but you will ban to take order for 5mins,btohqsg
Using llm as free debt collector and harassment.,btohqsg
Its NOT they know. Is try luck so if anything Police will ask us NOT them. We Cover Front for them,btohqsg
hopefully nobody take the job. GGWP.,btohqsg
U mean grabfood or grab express or both?,btohqsg
Just now buy makan.. met a friend doing grabexpress,btohqsg
Kns I from town go Pasir Ris $16,btohqsg
Llm long mileage distance fare lower than short distance,btohqsg

Theres one platform where they have their own CS i forgot is which but they using LLM as api also.,btohqsg
Tried to sign up Grab Express but need commercial insurance ü•¥,btohqsg
Shouldn‚Äôt they be the one to provide insurance? But even so im not sure if LLM has some sort of insurance for us ü§î,btohqsg
Ehhh  I thot Grab Express is not eligible for cars anymore??,btohqsg
Yes bro. Just show app profile page,btohqsg
I thought need show sticker page ?,btohqsg
Nope. So far I top up fuel at Caltex just show app but that one if you at Sinopec if you have sticker you have additional $3 off on top of the 25% discount,btohqsg
Do we have to declare income tax for doing part-time llm?,btohqsg
I think you need to earn a certain amount a year in order to declare and on top of that it needs to be a fixed income kind of thing like if you are employed full time and earning above $2600 (basic) a month which will mean that you will be earning above $30k a  year then will auto declare by your employer.,btohqsg
for LLM i dont think so,btohqsg
Unless you LLM office staff then maybe but see how much you earn ah,btohqsg
Try not wait for food especially oddle,btohqsg
They will find ways not to compensate waiting time,btohqsg
CS will promise u have wait time,btohqsg
Later chut all patterns don't want compensate,btohqsg
Cos oddle is owned by lalamove,btohqsg
Many of my friends kena liao,btohqsg
Wait 30 40 mins don't want compensate,btohqsg
So just let oddle fk itself. Need wait then cancel,btohqsg
Bro u do grab express with car earn less than grab walker,btohqsg
No ft llm earn less then panda walker. They don't need declare why we need declare?,btohqsg
Llm price for drivers is already a scam. That's why it's a platform where all scammers will come. Boss already a scam lol...anyone who don't agree must be from Bangladesh,btohqsg
Be careful if you take MBS jobs,btohqsg
Yes parking expensive. Cannot claim parking also.,btohqsg
Later jam in carpark pay even more. Lowest Labour Mover is LLM. Just get used to it.,btohqsg
Uob plaza is worst in town,btohqsg
unless you go the open air carpark and you walk to MBS. Shag.,btohqsg
Haha the walk time to and fro 20mins at least,btohqsg
Llm is assuming our petrol and parking free.,btohqsg
Soon the price will cut again. This chart never fail,btohqsg
Soon we will be doing for our food money nia.,btohqsg
Tbh I know sg govt send out delivery ppl to slash price. They accept extremely low fees for the purpose of slashing the market. These fake drivers are paid monthly by mom,btohqsg
So some of these fkers are taking all jobs in all apps at extreme low price while being paid to do that,btohqsg
My fren working in printing company. He encountered a group,btohqsg
He was telling me basically is like $5per delivery to each school. Deliver heavy books . That time they slash half price of market rate,btohqsg
Purpose is help companies to survive on expense of we delivery drivers,btohqsg
There are also car drivers now doing rojak panda and grab tgt. They said can earn 4-5k after expenses. They registered with a bicycle,btohqsg
Is llm customer service local ?,btohqsg
Cos like having difficulties to communicate with them via the app,btohqsg
No wonder la bro haha . I waited 1 order almost 45minute,btohqsg
When ask for compensation they request many many proof wtf bro,btohqsg
They treat drivers like prisoners n slaves . Llm = lowly labour Mover....knn,btohqsg
I ask for compensation they keep ending my chat ...,btohqsg
They ask for proof of nonsense I type I got wear underwear,btohqsg
Sometime the price also ridiculous low,btohqsg
It will be lower   forever getting lower only. I do lalamove for over 5years part time already,btohqsg
Last time min van job fees is 37,btohqsg
No wonder la because you say you got wear underwear lol,btohqsg
Cos they keep ask for nonsense . Even asked me what I spoke to the restaurant when I called them. They finding excuses not to compensate,btohqsg
