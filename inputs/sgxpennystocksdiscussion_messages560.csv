Singapore Storms Back Toward Pre-Virus Levels of Air Traffic1. Airlines in Asia are bringing back international capacity as the region gradually follows North America and Europe in reopening borders  led by the city-state of Singapore  whose economy depends on open access.2. By January  Singapore is poised to reach 84% of the weekly flights to Europe as it had in March last year  before the clampdown on travel. And there’ll be 1 519 flights from the financial hub to elsewhere in Asia  compared with only 194 in May 2020  data from aviation analytics firm Cirium show.3. Since the opening of more travel lanes  demand from Singapore has been strongest for flights within Asia -- with some fares surging. From December to January  ahead of the Lunar New Year and Beijing Winter Olympics  airlines plan the biggest monthly jump in flights from the island nation to the region since Cirium started providing the data in 2000.Refinitiv data ofSIA(<<== Click and login) on POEMS.Refinitiv data ofSATS(<<== Click and login) on POEMS.More here,btohqsg

The only fear is oil price is easily manipulated by OPEC,btohqsg
Not until end of this end year,btohqsg
When will the mainboard listing be announced?,btohqsg
OPEC suffered beginning of last year.They are now make less output but make more money.Why should there increase output but make less money.OPEC is smart,btohqsg
So what Medtec transfer to mainboardAs long as their earnings don’t justify the stock price  the price slumped,btohqsg
Still good in the movement 😊,btohqsg
Keppel don't own Kris  just a SS. Kris shareholders will not get back anything. Assets will be sold  and I don't think keppel will want to touch oil fields directly.,btohqsg
Big money is thru waiting not buy/sell,btohqsg

5k ? 65 only 20 percent ... Until reach that age .. this money no use Liao.. too little,btohqsg
That's what I did. I use cash to do CPF property refund  so next time I sell  I get more cash,btohqsg
If cpf give 10 percent interest rate .. also no use .. cannot even fully withdraw,btohqsg
Yes .. also can . Try not to use more cpf to pay your instalment .. end of the day you sell all go back to cpf .. Sian,btohqsg
Base on stat  a lot of people invest using CPF can't cover back the interest,btohqsg

Updates Blackgold ($0.020/$0.021)- Hidden buyers supporting 0.020- With China increased demand for coal  it will help Indonesian coal miners and Blackgold is one beneficiary(note: currently Blackgold have off take supply agreement directly to China state enterprise company)This power issue in mainland is not going to be solved over night  it will take time and the ongoing demand will be there. In addition they will probably buy more and store more coal too.Thus  IMO judging on thePA and potential bull flag in the making  will be expecting blackgold to test $0.023 year high.

CLSA downgrade. We turn more cautious on Raffles Medical (RFMD) following a policy change regarding PCR testing for passengers arriving to Changi Airport. From 27 Oct  passengers from a number of countries (Category 2 to 4) will no longer need to undergo PCR tests upon arrival. Although the vaccinated travel lane (VTL) still requires PCR tests and could drive 2022 earnings  its share is unlikely to enjoy a further rerating  in our view. Risk of further policy changes regarding PCR tests/prices  coupled with its earnings reliance on PCR tests could weigh on the stock. We cut our2022-2023estimates by 4%-8%  downgrade our recommendation from BUY to Underperform and lower our target price from S$1.87 to S$1.60 based on a c.18x 22CL EV/Ebitd,btohqsg

There seems to be steady accumulation in OKH. 4 reasons that we may see a strong run here:1. Neurology play - property micro cap like The Place and Sinjia have gone up multiple times and those BBs who make money there may rotate their profits to OKH which only has a tiny market cap at $24m.2. OKH managed to turn into profit of $3.8m for FY2021 (End Jun) after 2 years of loss. Mgt also guided that it's looking into new biz.3. Gordan Tang took a major stake at 10c and his wife  Celine is now the non-executive chairman. I'm sure the Tang couple will find ways to beef up FA of OKH so that price can be above of their purchase price in due time.4. Slow but steady accumulation seem going on from the TAShall we expect a run if Sinjia Land clear 10c??,btohqsg
