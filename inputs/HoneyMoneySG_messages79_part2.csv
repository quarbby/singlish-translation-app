Is Amaze card charged in foreign country consider amaze transit?,btohqsg
no. Amaze* transit is when using Amaze at general ticketing machine (GTM) at mrt/lrt/bus terminal,btohqsg
Hi pros  Anyone knows if we opt to pay via installment at courts etc  is the mcc code still the same?,btohqsg
Got it  thanks for the clarification!,btohqsg
If payment via installments  I think no rewards  no matter the MCC.,btohqsg
I paired with DCS then realised after a few weeks that anything with Amaze is excluded. üò≠,btohqsg
Hey guys  I came back from China this week. Would like to share with everyone we can pay like local using Alipay and WeChat Pay üòähttps://medium.com/@alangohek/3-essential-apps-for-foreigners-visiting-china-and-setup-a5ee6e18a0ee,btohqsg
Hi what is your go to crypto exchange to us in Singapore ?Also  for SOL holders ? Since coinhako and Gemini is useless for it.,btohqsg
Dbs  Cimb  DCS is no no,btohqsg
Yes  qualified   amaze not change the mcc,btohqsg
Yeah  rookie mistake was to assume it‚Äôs just AMAZE*TRANSIT excluded.,btohqsg
Tnc must read. Now the common exclusion to take note eg telco and utilities,btohqsg
wanna ask some advice for savings account.me and my gf planning to open a joint account for our future large expenses like wedding and housing reno.Any high interest savings account that we can go for?,btohqsg
Not sure why the MCC code of this can be utilities? Clearly this is not electricity  water or gas üòÅ,btohqsg
Congrats :) Do u or your gf happened to have UOB credit card?,btohqsg
this is not mcc code bah  mcc code is the 4 digit number for the transaction,btohqsg
Sign up like have promo leh. Forgot where i saw it,btohqsg
You are right. Instrarem now provides MCC code.. MCC is 4816,btohqsg
Look at the bottom right area  there should be a 4 digit Merchant Category Code,btohqsg
Hi guys! Want to ask for advice on CCs. Going to step into the adulting world soon and plan to use a CC for purchases and build points for miles. My plan is to use the CC for groceries  dining  entertainment  service subscriptions  and offline and online shopping (local and foreign webstores). After looking around the citi rewards + instarem seems like the best fit  but is there any other cards you guys can recommend?,btohqsg
Anybody tried pairing SCB simplycash cc and amaze together? Is it good to use?,btohqsg
No point. Simply cash is 1.5% cashback amaze fx spread is more than 2%. Amaze use for 4mpd card or high cashback specialise card,btohqsg
Cos i m purchasing laptop from US about 2.3k. Using hsbc or citi rewards not ideal cos max 1k each only,btohqsg
KF UOB? 3mpd uncapped  assuming u hit min spend for SIA Group,btohqsg
Hi all  sorry noob question.I am using Citi Reward Card paired with Instarem Amaze card. I tried to make a purchase of something which cost over $1000 ($1100 to be exact). When I try to tap my Instarem Amaze card  the transaction got declined.When I tried to tap directly with my Citi Reward Card  transaction got declined as well with error 'Do Not Honor'.Is there some sort of cap for Citi Reward Card e.g. $1000 max per transaction?,btohqsg
How many times u tried? Was the amaze card lock? Or set to other card?,btohqsg
Tried twice to tap with Instarem Amaze card  and twice with Citi Reward card standalone.I am in contact with Citibank support staff now to check as well.,btohqsg
Oh apparently I did not activate my Citi Reward physical card  so there are some cap placed on my digital card:-Can only make 9 successful transaction after activating digital card-Can only spend up to $1000 on a single transaction  any amount above will be declined. (This amount cannot be amended  unless you activate physical card).Issue resolved now  after activating my physical Citi Reward card üëç,btohqsg
I've checked the tnc again  cannot pay to the same billing organisation. So cannot. I only pay to the bonus saver credit card once and hope they consider it as one bill payment,btohqsg
Hello! Is UOB lady solitaire card or DBS woman‚Äôs world card better? I do not have an amaze card.,btohqsg
depends what u spend on? uob lady solitaire only give 6mpd for mcc under the bonus categories u selected. DBS gives 4mpd for online spend,btohqsg
Chill  at least is not fraudulent,btohqsg
It is subjective bcos uob lady solitaire is 6mpd on 2 categories till Feb. After Feb it is back to 4mpd. While DBSWWMC is 4mpd for online transaction. It is kinda use for diff purpose. Why not get both ?Each card got its own unique purpose.,btohqsg
is it cfmed to drop back to 4mpd in feb,btohqsg
Unless they mentioned extension of their 6mpd promotion. It is gonna revert back to 4,btohqsg

Hi guys  do anyone know if optical network router (ONR) can be purchased outside  wanted to upgrade my onr as it‚Äôs been like 8+ years n the signal starts to degrade even when I change my mesh wifi and my optical network cable  told Singtel about it and they want to charge me 100+ for it ‚ò†Ô∏è,btohqsg
Amaze is excluded for DBS Women's CC series. What's the point of linking to amaze?,btohqsg
True la. I don‚Äôt Citi premier and only UOB lady. So I thought use it for better rate overseas spend and just no rewards?,btohqsg
What are my options to link to Amaze beside Citi Premier?,btohqsg
Like that just use YouTrip is better,btohqsg
