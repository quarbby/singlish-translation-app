Both my boots are magnum stealth,btohqsg
They gave me stealth and want me to bang louder,btohqsg
Get the Magnum shiok sia. Damn comfortable.And got spare pair in my NPC  the AO found in store room. Gave to me and I sell on carousell to a cisco guy. $60,btohqsg
My magnums alr gave me ingrown toenails,btohqsg
The normal one. Not the SOC Magnum,btohqsg
SOC and PCG one is high cut right?,btohqsg
Eh no idt mine is high cut,btohqsg
No  SOC and PCG one is even higher cut. NPC de Magnum like only to above ankle.SOC one is high cut like army boots,btohqsg
I think half calf is the term,btohqsg
Mine is until my shin start,btohqsg
Ya. This is the normal NPC magnum,btohqsg
My front part is solid like metal sia,btohqsg
To me it’s comfortable. But some ppl find it hard. Usually it’s because they get half size too small.,btohqsg
Ah yes i got half a size smaller,btohqsg
Emart hasnt set up yet .-.,btohqsg
If really desperate can get on carousell. $40-70,btohqsg
The NSF and NSMen a lot selling,btohqsg
Nah i using my friends pair for a while,btohqsg
Also  your wisdom teeth removed already?,btohqsg
Then get it done during NS. Free and you get 1 week MC,btohqsg
My wisdom tooth okay why need remove,btohqsg
I wan go for whitening all the sauces making my teeth discolour,btohqsg
Good chance once you boomer  will need to remove.In the army they all know to do this. But in spf and scdf  very few ppl know,btohqsg
And wisdom extraction not cheap. Can be $1 000 per tooth if it comes out wrong way. If got not enough in medisave  pay cash,btohqsg
i saw the literal receipt during NS,btohqsg
I cant imagine needing to remove wisdom tooth,btohqsg
Simple extraction is cheap. But if grow sideways  it’s that much outside. Not Poly or govt price,btohqsg
That’s what I used to think until I had mine extracted a few months ago. Growing up always wondered what is this wisdom teeth nonsense.,btohqsg
Teaching is really popular in SG,btohqsg
Compared to most of the other NTU courses,btohqsg
its an iron rice bowl career that's why,btohqsg
Amen ill ask my cm about this,btohqsg
best iron rice bowl is military,btohqsg
shake leg  command NSFs to do ur work  free money,btohqsg
Also ask your army friends. Strange how it’s common knowledge to maximize this in saf but not scdf/spf,btohqsg
But if things go bad  you have a lot of responsibility,btohqsg
i will see 90% of the regulars get replaced with NSF officers instead,btohqsg
You should be in bed son,btohqsg
You should have your eyes closed and you should be unconscious,btohqsg
There is no spf sticker pack,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionu still going AFTC there on Monday?,btohqsg
I have to reach there 0745 Monday,btohqsg
what will happen if I don’t do well for jc 2 block exams? It doesn’t matter at all right? Because I’m gonna be taking a levels anyway. I have a fear of doing very badly for my exams like UUU (maybe only for math and not the other two h2s) but yeah.... i’m just scared.,btohqsg
ofc it doesn't matter if you are aiming for edusave scholarship award  but it definitely matters as a checkpoint test to see how well you know your stuff.,btohqsg

Join the group if u wanna jio for ball,btohqsg
