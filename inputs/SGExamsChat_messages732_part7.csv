its different from discriminating people for skin colour or gender or height  since thats way beyond their control  and not like having that will bring any physical consequences  but obesity genuinely leads to health issues lol,btohqsg
Dude do u admit you kinda look deadly,btohqsg

I keep thinking rand is short asf,btohqsg

As much as i wanted a non-merger jc  i dun think i can pull myself to retake Os coz my score was ok-ish,btohqsg
Ain't no way blud get U for PW,btohqsg
Ngl from personal exp  $$ you can just earn during festive season from Christmas till cny and it'll be more than enough to retake Os. So you'll only work for a few months till late Feb and that's it. Rest of the months you can just focus mainly on studies,btohqsg
It is becoz u wun get school resources and u need to be really way more disciplined and stuff,btohqsg

If all embryos are humans IVF won't work because they have to cul and kill insemination that have an obvious chance of not working.,btohqsg
