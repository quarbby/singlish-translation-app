i didnt even get A for english at O levels LOL,btohqsg
Well at least one of the reasons why,btohqsg
depends ah but mostly good hahah,btohqsg
dont need stress la tbh know your stuff as well as possible so u leave the exam hall w no regrets,btohqsg
just make sure to use ur study break well,btohqsg
It‚Äôs ok NP business will make O levels seem like a piece of cake,btohqsg
BCOMM WILL MAKE OLEVEL ENGLISH SEEM LIKE A PIECE OF CAKE,btohqsg
isnt that poly in general HAHAHAHAHA js tt other polys have synchronous lectures,btohqsg
Nah my friends in other Polys are still slacking,btohqsg
some ppl say u get into np business = olevels q good,btohqsg
by decent u mean can buy chicken rice right,btohqsg
ya la can buy chicken rice,btohqsg
but rmb modules arent meant for u to fail,btohqsg
IMP screwed up my GPA horribly,btohqsg
theyre not easy but they arent extremely difficult,btohqsg
i barely pass and im glad,btohqsg
Sadly I really overestimated myself and underestimated poly,btohqsg
if u have poa background  year 1 accounting is gna be easier,btohqsg
Plus group project politics are a nightmare,btohqsg
i didnt know the grades have a 5% difference,btohqsg
Need to be so careful with what you say and how you behave,btohqsg
ya cbp has year 1 accounting too,btohqsg
is this polytechnic discussion in the sgexams chat,btohqsg
isit difficult to get a high GPA,btohqsg
Sorry a few ppl and me brought poly up,btohqsg
its ok im a poly student too üòÉüòÉ,btohqsg
from my experience  yes. but i have friends and classmates with high gpas too and they seem very chill,btohqsg
so it rly depends on the individual ?,btohqsg
the most important thing is to be consistent,btohqsg
Engineering is much easier than BA,btohqsg
in courses like nursing and ecde  a low 3 is considered high,btohqsg
id say compared to jc poly u have to be consistently studying cuz in some polys theres some daily graded thingy and like every small thing is graded so u cant anyhow screw up,btohqsg
it's still manageable if u don't tho,btohqsg
whereas in jc all that matters are the bigger exams and eventually A levels,btohqsg
high high hopes for a living/s,btohqsg
RP is dang easy trust me,btohqsg
bro no u fuck up one day ur grade dies,btohqsg
but in poly   every module matters bc it adds up?,btohqsg
Some of my classmates that smoke all day can get 3.8,btohqsg
yes every module with credit units HAHAHA,btohqsg
Not all some have negligible weightage,btohqsg
Like there‚Äôs this one module called health and wellness,btohqsg
my classmate who come late and pon class on other occasions got A for the module's assignment,btohqsg
ya FUCKING GLB I HATE GLB,btohqsg
pe + health ed frm what i heard,btohqsg
I‚Äôm easily stronger than the friggin instructors,btohqsg
That‚Äôs when you know a module is useless,btohqsg
np shld hire u to teach h&w then,btohqsg
Tbh most people in my CCA probably could HAHAHA,btohqsg
idk why they‚Äôre wasting money on that stupid module honestly,btohqsg
But I sometimes meetup to go run,btohqsg
ya i hate online cca tbh,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I ponnteng all the sessions,btohqsg
ya and must be on zoom,btohqsg
hi guys for a level chem practical how to allocate time,btohqsg
Wait which CCA are you in,btohqsg
wah finally something that i can answer properly LMAO,btohqsg
right they tell me on cam but i nvr did tho hahah,btohqsg
ok i kinda forgot the format but just finish the simple titration as fast as possible,btohqsg
scan thru the steps for the next experiment,btohqsg
i want to get away w it too,btohqsg
and highlight / underline key points,btohqsg
i tried to dao them to no avail,btohqsg
okiee i shd js liek do 1/2 times den fake the last one right,btohqsg
no actually u dont have to,btohqsg
yall only hv once a week right,btohqsg
for titration as long as 2 of ur results are + - 0.02 apart,btohqsg
dont even need to fake the third one,btohqsg
unless ur first 2 the gap big,btohqsg
then i suggest u redo the experiment a third time,btohqsg
yes like the only CCA on sat i believe ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
but dont spend too much time on that cuz that one v basic,btohqsg
the 2nd physical chem experiment will need more time and focus,btohqsg
personally id jot down my results first in pencil before drawing table,btohqsg
hell no archery has mon wed sat cca,btohqsg
and for organic chem / QA right im not exactly good at having positive result for like gases so if u see a procedure thats testing for a gas  look out for pop sounds (hydrogen) and brown gas (nitrogen somethinng i forgot) and the white precipitation in Ca(OH)2 (CO2),btohqsg
the QA and Organic chem should be easy to breeze thru too so id say spend more time on the 2nd physical chem practical and ESP THE PLANNING u will confirm need at least 30mins to do it properly,btohqsg
Omg 30 mins is alot tho,btohqsg
This is probably the most active group I've ever seen,btohqsg
since practical is 2.5 hours  u should be done with simple titration within 20mins  then 2nd physical chem experiment 45mins  QA and Organic chem in 45mins  planning at least 30mins,btohqsg
its actually quite fast cuz for planning u need to write out the steps carefully  make sure u know what apparatus u using  which chemical comes first  pre-calculations  drawing of diagram if necessary  drawing of results in table/graphthen coming to conclusion,btohqsg
Okie thank you fr the advice HAHA hopefully i wld be able to put it into good use tmr üò¨,btohqsg
i will laugh at you too but still,btohqsg
i mean... im js being honest ok,btohqsg
Yes  but for the daily grades/graded assignment/exam modules  not for pass/fail modules  I mean if you're referring to the modules that can affect the GPABut even pass/fail modules are also importantIf you fail the pass/fail modules  you're just gonna waste your time on retaking those modules and you're gonna suffer with those boring modules again,btohqsg
anyone here keen to do a question paper i made on H2 Bio on viruses for As (for j2s only - because of some topics),btohqsg

I've seen spam bots being able to send links in the other group,btohqsg
We should consider switching to a better bot such as protectron,btohqsg
im sure can find other bots,btohqsg
but the cas ban is good,btohqsg
CAS is a global database hahaha,btohqsg
Honestly I was thinking about protectron,btohqsg
It's semi intelligent and supposedly uses machine learning or smth,btohqsg
