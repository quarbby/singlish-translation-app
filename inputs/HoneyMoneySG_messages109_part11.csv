Bros and sisters.Beware of fun toast.Not all outlets allow paywave. Mostly can't... except harbour front ..,btohqsg
Up to you... i use cash if cost less than 5,btohqsg
brother  if you want to buy 1 cup and want to pay cash  best is you go kopitiam.$1.50-$1.80 cents,btohqsg
Opps.... sorry I forgot about this.. so sorry bro,btohqsg
Sometimes good to be penny wise pound foolish ya. Important to take a few minutes discussing on a chat on what cards to use before spending a few dollars on fast food coffee,btohqsg
Anyone know if pay town council with uob LS will move uob1 tracker for $500 spend?,btohqsg
Some people just canâ€™t think when in front of counter on what cards to use  I have that experience a few times ðŸ˜ž,btohqsg
"Don't bother unless there's good membership sale1% equivalent means you got to spend 10K before you ""break even"" from the cashback",btohqsg
"If the bakery is linked to a ""restaurant"" (e.g. the Breadtalk at causeway point is linked to Toast box)  it getspossibly billedas the restaurantThen again she might be using it to purely clock account requirement too",btohqsg
Is there a way to get a refund on cc annual fee ? Missed the date to ask for waiver and they charged the fee.,btohqsg
Yeah thatâ€™s why I think she has some thinking behind it,btohqsg
Waiver is requested after fee is charged. Just call in and ask ... else if cannot   see if they willing to waive if u ask to cancel,btohqsg
Is Kopitiam app considered online spend? Checked but canâ€™t find,btohqsg
Anyone got experience with Citi rewards waiving the annual fee? Itâ€™s my most used card.,btohqsg
Citibank are quite liberal with annual fees waiver I feel.Having said that  I have my PREMIERMILES for many years  and I used it for many OCCASIONS including buying coffee @ Toast Box,btohqsg
I think they meant youtrip. If not I dk what he talking also.,btohqsg
Got mine waived after using it for over a year  i always used it with amaze,btohqsg
Some mentioned that itâ€™s not considered online spend. Might not want to risk it,btohqsg
Restaurant won't clock 4mpd also. That's why I said the bakery sold bags ðŸŒš,btohqsg
is the hotline to call just their normal line?,btohqsg
oh my bad  i saw it as Lady's card ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I wrote in to their support chat (in the app)But if you wanna call  it should be the hotline (called in for fraud   but they seem to accept it as with other transactions),btohqsg
Mostly of the times  nobody know what this guy is trying to say,btohqsg
Any credit card offer passes for lounge access to sapporo new chitose airport lounge?,btohqsg
Maybe he saying trip into the pool,btohqsg
Guys  which app has the best exchange rate for sgdmyr and also can topup to tng? Thanks,btohqsg
yes but link credit card instead of apple pay,btohqsg
With iChange suspension of TnG reload  alternative is YouTrip. But see this:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/184108,btohqsg
I think amaze cos top up using credit card got surcharge... Using debit card no fee. Then you can giro the underlying credit card of amaze with hsbc giro for additional 1% cashback.,btohqsg
Ya thats the problem now  ichange was the best last time,btohqsg
@MelvynEzicare to share what's wrong with my suggestion? I have an upcoming trip to Malaysia in June... Wanted to top up my amaze wallet before the new charges come in.,btohqsg
What's your actual step-by-step plan when you proposed that?Top-up Amaze Wallet? Then reload to TnG?Reload TnG with Amaze linked card?,btohqsg
Ah... I think I missed a step... Use mastercard top up amaze wallet  then use amaze wallet to top up TnG card.,btohqsg
If u plan to spend  why dont try ichange?,btohqsg
I'll be mainly using amaze card link with maybank FnF card. Only for places where credit card isn't accepted  then I will use TnG.,btohqsg
Hi guru  is it true that if one top up 8k to SA and 15.3k SRS in the same calendar year. This total value of 23.3k will be included in the next year tax relief?,btohqsg
Top-up Amaze Wallet then reload TnG - no CC rewards  have an FX spread (bad exchange rate compared to just using YouTrip)  will incur top-up fees from Jun 24 for Amaze Wallet  withdraw MYR from ATM with 2% feeReload TnG with Amaze linked card - no CC rewards  have even worse FX spread (worse than topping up Amaze Wallet)  incur 1% top-up fees for TnG reload with CC  withdraw MYR from ATM with 2% feeReload TnG with YouTrip - no CC rewards  MasterCard wholesale exchange rate  no top-up fees  withdraw S$400 in MYR from ATM without fees  cannot store MYR,btohqsg
Yes  assuming you understand tax reliefs.,btohqsg
If accept CC  then best to use Amaze linked card. But if going places that only accept TnG/cash  always good to have YouTrip card.,btohqsg
Amaze convert to myr store in wallet  dont use sgd wallet to top up tng. Use the myr wallet,btohqsg
Eh really meh? I thought Amaze Wallet by itself quite closed to spot (like youtrip/trust etc)ðŸ˜¨,btohqsg
Correct ah. But you already incur FX spread the moment you convert to MYR on Amaze Wallet.,btohqsg
Their exchange rate is quite good de. Better then youtrip i find. But after the 1 percent fee inplement then i not sure worth it liao anot,btohqsg
Amaze Linked card is slightly over 2% spread now  Amaze Wallet I remember is almost 1% spread. But to be accurate is just check against MC website before top-up lor.OP's keyword is best exchange rate ma.,btohqsg
hi all  is payment to m1 broadband entitled for cashback for citibank cashback+ credit card?,btohqsg
But youtrip don't have MYR so mastercard will use SGD-USD-MYR for conversion isn't it? Yet their rate will still be better than Amaze wallet SGD-MYR (edit: maybe it is transparent to us  even with MYR currency  mastercard might still do SGD-USD-MYR)?For your para 1  I don't intend to do atm withdrawal  just TnG top up  so I'm not concerned about that. Yes  the 1% top up fee will be the killer after 1 June.,btohqsg
They use SGD-MYR based on MasterCard wholesale rate. Why would they use SGD-USD-MYR?,btohqsg
