Hi for the EGA bonus interest promo for March 2023  anyone unable to participate because they participated in the previous EGA bonus interest promo? I received this message after sending the SMS.HSBCSG: Thank you for registering for our Mar EGA Bonus Interest Promotion. Please note that you will not be eligible for this promotion if you have previously registered within the months of DEC22 to FEB23. Visit HSBC Singapore website for T&Cs.,btohqsg
can send sms and register  but if under a existing promo window already the registration will be invalid,btohqsg
So if you use 2 HSBC accounts to participate in Dec 2022 to Feb 2023 EGA bonus interest promo  both accounts cannot be used for Mar to June 2023. Which means you may only wish to use 1 HSBC account for Mar to June 2023 and the other 1 HSBC account for say July to Sep 2023 EGA bonus interest promo.,btohqsg
dec to feb is when u sms register?,btohqsg
Yes  it is only got the period Dec 2022 to Feb 2023 right? Will need to register again on Mar 2023 for the March bonus interest promo right?,btohqsg
dec registered covers dec to mar window that's why mar registration will not count,btohqsg
Ooh... So in order for you to be eligible for Apr 2023 onwards  the registration should happen on Apr 2023  will HSBC say that your account is not eligible?,btohqsg
jan registration also covers Apr (jan to apr). hsbc will not say not eligibleu still haven't say when u registered previously,btohqsg
