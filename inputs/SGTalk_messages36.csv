Takes great pride in our 100% pure  natural  non-pasteurized kosher  halal premium Canadian HoneyThis honey is in its natural crystallized form  which means you get to enjoy all of its original goodness  delicate floral source flavour  and beneficial enzymes. The benefits of it not being filtered is that it contains tiny bits of beeswax and bee pollen; like eating honey straight from the hive! honey can kill bacteria because it contains properties such as hydrogen peroxide and defensin-1 proteins. The authors concluded that honey could have greater antibacterial activity than other types of honey.,btohqsg
