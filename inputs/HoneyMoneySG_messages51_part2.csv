I think can keep zero also if you dont have giro deductions. the $2000 can earn interest elsewhere. eg. if 3.48% at GXS can give you $5.8. but if prefer to keep things simple and don't take any risk can keep $2000 also  but also means that your reference month amount will be $2000 instead of zero.,btohqsg

Hello everyone  if i just started working and only received my first half month salary  can i apply for UOB One Credit Card with myinfo?,btohqsg
Hi guys  have you ever encountered such messages from Instarem. My account was suspended.,btohqsg
Omg. What did u do? Keep topping up and withdraw?,btohqsg
I doubt you can as you won't have enough 'credit score' yet. Unless you agree to put like FD of X amount  then I think maybe they will let you. You can try call the bank and chat with them to confirm first.,btohqsg
That is the issue  UOB doesnt accept calls from non-UOB members,btohqsg
No. I just did a transaction for my son overseas lodging in pounds.,btohqsg
Hi i think the bank need minimum 3 month salary if i am not wrong,btohqsg
Maybe because ETF is different from stock,btohqsg
Oh maybe they detect u did a big payment to third party. No biggie. Just satisfy them with their request of the selfie etc. should unblock u one la,btohqsg
They asking for ID. I donâ€™t know what should I provide? So asking anyone had such experience and what was provided.,btohqsg
This one u just put your nric beside your head and take a selfie. Yes it looks stupid but I think thatâ€™s what they want b,btohqsg
Okay. Will do that. They already enrolled me using my Singpass. Why they donâ€™t trust me??,btohqsg
Because SingPass can be done by other people as long as they have your phone with passcode.They need to verify you are the actual applicant.No worries not a big thing.I remember either revolut or bigpay was even more funny. They required u to record a selfie VIDEO following the verbal instructions. Look left. Look right. Look up.,btohqsg
Haha. I think they know AI can imitate human also.,btohqsg
Besides the advice from the folks  would like to suggest that u verify the sender of the note and also the return channel to ensure u r providing the two items to legit parties. U might also want to verify through  instrarem chat the authenticity of the note.,btohqsg
This is the email and it has my case #.I believed is valid.,btohqsg
