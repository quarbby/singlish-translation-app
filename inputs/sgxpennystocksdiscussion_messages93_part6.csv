"KUALA LUMPUR - Malaysia's Cabinet was locked in a special meeting on Friday (Oct 23) morning to decide on emergency measures to ensure that the upcoming budget session in Parliament does not result in snap elections amid the resurgent wave of coronavirus infections.Sources with knowledge of these options told The Straits Times that an ""economic emergency"" could be proclaimed to ensure that government spending to curb Covid-19 - which has seen total cases doubling this month alone - is not jeopardised by an increasingly unstable political atmosphere.""It will not be similar to the curfews and military presence we had after the 1969 race riots.""Instead  normal life under the Movement Control Order (MCO) will continue  without politics getting in the way of dealing with a health crisis "" said one source on the condition of anonymity as the matters are official government secrets.A top ministerial aide told ST that the Cabinet's decision to invoke emergency powers has now been brought to the National Security Council meeting on Friday afternoon.""The special Cabinet meeting was to ensure we have a Budget 2021 that can be implemented. We have to wait for the PM's audience with the King "" he said  refusing to comment further on the agenda.ST has learnt that Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin is due to meet the Malaysian King on Friday evening to seek royal assent from the federation's Supreme Ruler for a proclamation of emergency.The special Cabinet meeting on Friday morning was attended by the Armed Forces Chief  Inspector-General of Police and Attorney General.ST understands that they were consulted earlier in the week after high-level meetings saw health officials vehemently put forward their case to ensure that national elections do not happen until the outbreak is contained.The polls in easternmost state of Sabah last month - which were held even as new infection clusters emerged there - were a key factor in Malaysia recording unprecedented numbers of new cases this month.The country has seen over 800 daily new infections reported several times this week  far more than previous highs of just over 200.",btohqsg
