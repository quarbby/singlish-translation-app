Wah. This is bad news . Amaze nerf earning at just 5-$ per month.Spend oversea will at least 200 sing and above...may consider . Revoult soon,btohqsg
Use trust lor easy ni need top up Plus nice decent google rates,btohqsg
"Nerf or not  I don't really care about Amaze's InstaPoints. I just want to use Amaze to tank the otherwise 3.25% bank FX fees and ""slightly better"" exchange rate while binding it with my Mastercard for rewards that's all.",btohqsg
Bro. Revoult can withdraw oversea up to 350 is free,btohqsg
Overseas  I use trust when I need cash and amaze linked card for payment. Different use cases.,btohqsg
in order to get the 8.4% rewards  the $$$ must be go to the moneybull or any of the money market fund will do ?,btohqsg
I’m curious where you get this 200 sgd from,btohqsg
Yea i think it still has its uses  as long as it fx spread is below bank 3.25% for UOB ladys etc. Converting spend to online for CRMcC  UOB Krisflyer  etc,btohqsg
The $200k upgrade route need to maintain $200k in the account else they will downgrade you again. If you cannot maintain that just do the $15k monthly route. Using $15k route you can do the $15k in and do 5 transaction and withdraw out the fund if you wish.,btohqsg
Because go holiday you need to eat and spend shopping oversea .,btohqsg
If you spend 200sgd  nerf or not doesn’t affect you,btohqsg
1st of June. You will pay 2.1% if visa top up... so better not use visa .,btohqsg
Thumb of rule.Never ever use any source of top up using your rewards card. 0 miles earn.,btohqsg
Ohhh nooo cannot use visa alrd. My life is going to end,btohqsg
Is this mean to be a pun?,btohqsg
I don’t see a pun tho,btohqsg
Coz visa top up wallet always have charges  only mastercard no to amaze wallet. But now all have fee liao. Have u been toping up amaze wallet with visa?,btohqsg
Amaze big change just only 1 insta point to 0.5? Top up fees no impact if pay using credit card,btohqsg
every $2 1 point so you will get cashback up to $1k spend monthly,btohqsg
Erm  top up fee increase for both visa and mastercard from 1 jun to amaze wallet,btohqsg
If using credit card to pay directly no impact right?,btohqsg
Then it is not consider top up. It is link card  with nerf like this within a few month of amaze  not hard to see more nerf coming. Just not sure when and what it is,btohqsg
A lot of possible nerfs that will come. But if they remove those no one will use the card since amaze card by itself is pretty useless,btohqsg
Like grabpay card die off by itself loh,btohqsg
Yea not surprising that will happen to amaze. Honestly they kinda dumb to increase the top up fee and reduce the instapoints in the same nerf.,btohqsg
Time to update amaze again after the Grab nerf series,btohqsg
This means the company has done the analysis. Top up wallet n insta point rewards does not give profit to the company because low FX spread n rewards eat into its profit.,btohqsg
I know but doing it in the same nerf doesn’t incentivise people to top up to amaze rather than using linked card. Now they are just targeting one use case which is using amaze and link card.,btohqsg
But the cap of instapoints in the issue if they wish to target more user groups,btohqsg
Paynow is instant cash gone haha. Use cc top up then giro from ega u get extra 1 percent,btohqsg
isn't it supposed to be rule of thumb...,btohqsg
Basically they limit user to spend 1k on link card for overseas uses to get the max reward,btohqsg
Amaze wallet fx rate is not even that low compared to other travel cards right?,btohqsg
I guess ppl prefer trust or youtrip more after the change,btohqsg
Yea I mean if they were to increase top up fee but increase points earn through wallet. At least that can target a seperate group. Just my two cents,btohqsg
Use to be able to clock the 2k insta in a few month  now is at least 4 month then can redeem 1 time 20 dollar  1 year is 60 only.,btohqsg
Technically ya  but more likely people uses linked card  so retrospective to bank fx fee is better,btohqsg
Yes  i mean amaze wallet as a use case is now bad since you can use other travel cards and no need to be held hostage by their cashback,btohqsg
Ya their instapoint expire in 12 month as well haha,btohqsg
I think the problem with limit to 500 instapoint per month is when ppl go travelling  that is when big spending hit. I go malaysia weekly for doc also wont hit the 500 instapoint. Haha,btohqsg
Sometimes I made big purchase overseas. This change will make amaze quite limiting for that purpose.,btohqsg
Yea if you go like Europe countries or even Japan  easily hit the cap. Better choice would be an annual cap instead of a monthly since people don’t usually spend huge amount every month,btohqsg
wouldn't amaze be more for the amaze + crmc   so that you can convert to online spending + get 4mpd? instapoints is more like a bonus since its really hard to hit unless you spend in overseas currency often  especially with the 12 months expiry date,btohqsg
Before the nerf was quite easy  the limit was 500 per transaction instead of per month.,btohqsg
Hiii dining at Kopitiam and paying with FairPrice app is it considered dining or family?,btohqsg
When I search on this chat paying to town council seem like not much option,btohqsg
To earn Cashback too bo other option ?,btohqsg
Any insurance pros here ? Eg I go to the hospital as a follow up to my accident. I pay bill myself and then make a claim against insurance companies after that. However  I have 2 overlapping insurance for personal and company ones. If I double claim  they have to pay me and it should not be trackable isn't it?When I was hospitalised with a 10k bill  I understand the insurance companies pay them directly thus I cannot claim twice.,btohqsg
If pay via axs app ? Visa master which card wil earn Cashback,btohqsg
