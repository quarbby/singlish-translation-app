And i got my eae alrd,btohqsg
I only like phys chem and math,btohqsg
Hahaha all higher level physics maths and chem studies require u to write longer “essays” than ur avg english exam,btohqsg
You’ll learn a lot of physics and chemistry in poly,btohqsg
Yeah  I’m posing that as a good thing,btohqsg
you cant do physics without maths,btohqsg
H2 physics doesn’t even touch basic calculus,btohqsg
Reminds me maybe i should bring phycis shit during night shifts,btohqsg
God bless covid nth much to do during night shift,btohqsg
then you can use your bullet trajectory to learn projectile motion,btohqsg
there is no other time in your life that you can lepak and play pubg,btohqsg
It becomes boring after like 1 hr i am then left with 11+ hrs of nothingness,btohqsg
Which is why i said i should bring phy stuff .-.,btohqsg
then 11+ hours would fly past,btohqsg
It really depends. For example  if I went to polytechnic  I would probably have failed.And JC stuff is very watered down  so it's not anything near impossible to do. Have confidence in yourself,btohqsg
2 years on I dont understand anything,btohqsg
And in JC  you technically can relax initially and study hard in the end and still get decent results. But in poly  you have a GPA,btohqsg
I went to poly cuz i know what i want to do,btohqsg
That you need to maintain from day 1,btohqsg
In secondary sch my studies are very inconsistent,btohqsg
but yeah I guess you could,btohqsg
When I was your age  my direction was completely different from now. How do you know you won't change?,btohqsg
Oh i thot you talking abt jc,btohqsg
But in poly  you have projects,btohqsg
I study everyday but sometimes less sometimes more,btohqsg
plus can let you become occifer in NS,btohqsg
plus can help you get uni,btohqsg
And in JC  if you need help  you have your teachers. I believe in poly they don't really are out to help you,btohqsg
I wouldn't say my decision was mature,btohqsg
You mean poly students cannot become officer?,btohqsg
but you look at the statistics,btohqsg
technically poly students also can enter uni,btohqsg
Some of my friends keep changing their mind about what they want to do. They graduated from uni but they are clueless,btohqsg
Good. But do you have a backup plan if it doesn't work out?,btohqsg
But in poly  if you want to go to uni in something unrelated  it might be hard to get in. You may need to start over,btohqsg
What if it doesn’t work out  as in you lose motivation to do it?,btohqsg
But how do you know you won't change,btohqsg
How do you know you don't love something else?,btohqsg
But my answer to this if I were you is that I’d willingly take the risk,btohqsg
THATS WHAT EVERY GUY SAYS WHEN HE FALLS IN LOVE,btohqsg
Take the risk to do what?,btohqsg
Take the risk that I might change in the future  and be stuck with a diploma unrelated to what I like in the future,btohqsg
I never loved mathematics until I was in JC1. So you never know,btohqsg
Had I gone to poly  even if I had done well  generally you cannot get into a mathematics course in uni,btohqsg
Exactly. With the ever changing skill set in demand  you never know what lies ahead,btohqsg
I know. But in general  in the future  what you dream of may not be possible,btohqsg
Because it is something i would truly enjoy doing,btohqsg
Idw to go to work doing things that i dislike,btohqsg
How do you know that what you do in the poly course and the uni course is what you like?,btohqsg
I research abt the module in poly,btohqsg
