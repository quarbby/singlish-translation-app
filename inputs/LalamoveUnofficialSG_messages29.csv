And it's still under on going process,btohqsg
Customer paid me for parking just now. MPV job,btohqsg

Airport to jurong west $22 only. Wth,btohqsg

Think last time fare is round up,btohqsg
Was going to say that tooIts prob cos last time round up fare  now fare looks lower,btohqsg
Bcos fare is correct for 42km,btohqsg
now bike fare higher than car,btohqsg
Think this weekend our fingers will have blisters from all that scrolling. For safety reasons  dont think can take orders whilst driving with all the scroll  click  swipe and click again.,btohqsg
I meant the fare is correct for bike jobWas it car or bike job lol,btohqsg
Dont. I nearly accident while scrolling,btohqsg
I think new app has another glitch,btohqsg
They not counting in the first 4km $4 for car jobs,btohqsg
The mileage they state is total journey minus 4km,btohqsg
HmmSome are correct some are not,btohqsg
Like this one  mileage should be 15km and total fare $21,btohqsg
But they only count the mileage after minus first 4km,btohqsg
Any one.know how to take order automatically,btohqsg
Very likely.. My earning lower than usual,btohqsg
Some are correct some are wrong,btohqsg
I reach home see my other pending job,btohqsg
The thing is we dont know how they cacualte the distance,btohqsg
At most also 1 or 2 km difference  cant be 4 km difference,btohqsg

Just the long waiting time for them to pick up is a pain,btohqsg
Maybe u try 10am or 3pm that kind of no one call them timing,btohqsg
Don't try the timing where the customers also call them.. They will entertain customers over us,btohqsg

Live chat.. U call  they will ask u live chat,btohqsg
Recently i live chat  talk halfway the agent ended chatMy blood boiling liao damn pissThen suddenly got phone callThe cso say sorry she terminated by mistake lol 🤣,btohqsg

Aiya.. Relearn the whole app like we first started lor..,btohqsg
But thats the thing alsoThe platform is their core businessYou would think they invest in that and get that right first mah,btohqsg
The only thing that must make noise is the discrepancy in fares,btohqsg
And cannot see bike job laDamn painful,btohqsg
Bike jobs today after deductions like beggar money,btohqsg

"Brought in food  as I watch in front of glass door and points to ask me come in and take. .. no one time dont have to wait  its ok. But are they treated like this by their guests?My friend kenna "" you wait outside there..""",btohqsg
Watch u walk in and take .. watch u go out..,btohqsg

Can i ask seniors. If need to cancel scheduled job due to family reasons. What will lalamove do ah? Fine? Suspend? Or ok de?,btohqsg
Must state what type of reason. If valid then no suspension i think,btohqsg
Need a good excuse. Once I live chat the CS say ok then couple of days later SMS say provide proof.,btohqsg
Cancel the earlier the betterIf early enough maybe suspend 1  2 days  or maybe not if the officer good moodIf valid with proof ya should be ok,btohqsg
Another alternative is find someone to do the job for u,btohqsg
I see. Thanks all for the help,btohqsg

Just now almost kena trick by mpv jobSee big fare only kan cheongLucky i see in time is kfc job  never accept 🤣,btohqsg
Bt batok to Yishun $14 niaMy car see liao engine dunno how to start,btohqsg
Hi Bros  when we swipe to cfm  but we can even press to cancel the job or final cfm the order 🤔 1st time use today so Confusing...,btohqsg
New app got update maybe might fix some stuff,btohqsg
So now bike job is less $1 ++,btohqsg
Last time 5km is $12Now 5km is $10.6,btohqsg

YaBb to ys $14.80 vs $16,btohqsg
Different mah we need to get up get down send things wor,btohqsg
Ya. Actually I don't like delivery coz need to up & down,btohqsg
Same ma phv have to wait call,btohqsg
And not really also bb to ys on justgrab should be ard 16-18,btohqsg
Llm got call u dun need to wait,btohqsg
Llm app also bad.Today took job. Pick up address is Westgate. But shop at Jem.Deliver to tuas. Postal code & actual address is 2km away. No block/unit number also. I almost want to throw away the food liao. 😑😑,btohqsg
Er.... Maybe last timeNow u see the jobsCannot take btb liao,btohqsg
You navigate to your map from the app?,btohqsg
That 5 sec is to force u to read the remarks,btohqsg
U need to wait till the button light up then press confirm again,btohqsg
One of those days everything also salah,btohqsg
1st llm job. Prob last. Hahaha,btohqsg
Who ask u go tuas 🤣,btohqsg
I gg pioneer for work mah. Was thinking not bad can cover abit. End up waste time. + climb stairs somemore. 😭😭😭,btohqsg
Mean once we swipe is tt we get the job  only depend on us to final cancel or cfm the job 🤔  today I swipe the job but was looking at the scroll part  than job disappear 🤣 after I check at on going section whether I get this job bo  but show nothin...2nd job I swipe  and wait for the cfm button up  then I press  then I was assign the jobThis seem to be quite fair as for those who accidental swipe for jobs we mistakenly swipe,btohqsg
They jus want ppl to read the remarks laBut that 5sec damn kan cheong cos another driver can snatch the jobI only staring at the button never read,btohqsg
One more question Bro  for example if both of us swipe at the same time  means both of us got an equal chances to press cfm buttonOrOnce u fastest finger swipe  u will be given a 5 sec to consider or give up the job 🤔,btohqsg
Nope the 5sec not exclusive to youIf another driver swiped 2 sec earlier he gets to confirm 2 sec earlierWhich would be when u still staring at the button to light up,btohqsg
Oic  technically when we swipe and we must decide fast n keep trying pressing the cfm 🤣 button at shortest time possible.OrPress cancelOrjust leave it to expires...,btohqsg
Cannot make it fasterThose 5 sec u jus waiting to see your fate only 🤣,btohqsg
OK  as u mention if other ppl swipe 2 sec before u  technically u loss 2 sec for that  even wait for 5 sec  once they cfm  u still loss out... Am I right to say tt  🤔 unless the eariler party didn't do any action n let it expires  then we got the opportunity to wait 5s n cfm...,btohqsg
Thats why those 5 sec very irritatingLast time u finger fast can celebrateNow finger swipe fast then still need to pray no one take the job while the 5 sec ticking by ...,btohqsg
Yalor  haha  is like having second chance 🤣 but I do like the expires  especially when we swipe the wrong job  for example Car accidently swipe a Van job  just let it expires or click cancel n move on... No need to call CS or customer explain like shit... This part I do like it...,btohqsg
Haha ya i think thats wat they trying to achieve also,btohqsg
You need to experience the stephen chow inspiration la,btohqsg
Actually LLM can make it more simple 1st swipe to take order.2nd  5s to read3rd  cfm button show up and press cfm.Or.Just leave it to expires after 5s without tt cancel bottom part...,btohqsg
"Today I swipe  wow so blur... Looking at the scroll part what ""I not the....  then see the cfm button later... Bf I try to click... 🤣",btohqsg
Leave it to expire they need to block out the 5sec for each driver  slows down the order taking i think,btohqsg
Also so many steps added  what swipe to pick up  👍 take pic  unload  lah  what check with customer lah... Haha,btohqsg
First 2 days i kena swipe alrdy so happy  start engine wear seatbelt..... Then realise forget to press confirm zzz,btohqsg
But Bro  pic is take 1 or 2  this part also blur 🤣  I just take 1 pic n send...,btohqsg
I also  tgt swipe  wow done let go.. But order not shown up 🙄 confusing haha,btohqsg
Haha  thanks Bro for sharing and explain this part more clear  hope Bros here can share advise too... Happy lala Bro driver  rider 🤣,btohqsg

If we don't do llm then what else can do? Any ideas?,btohqsg
I just tried to stack 3 orders and it's possible,btohqsg
$2500/7 = $357.14 per day.Assuming 15hrs = $23.8 per hourAt current fares  no way,btohqsg
Super high stressI admire ppl who can do it,btohqsg
Actually the 3 right. The heng heng is 2 of them is side by side block,btohqsg
The service counter doubt me abit,btohqsg
Heng traffic ok sia. If not I confirm stress 🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Dinner time. Try 1 time enough. Cannot play with god hahahahahhahaha,btohqsg
Can if uNormal fares + gold incentive + (+$4/tripafter hit gold) + highest streak bonus + 7 days a week - social/family life - toilet breaks - sleep = $2 500 😁,btohqsg
"""just by driving""Haiz no conscience sia this ad",btohqsg
"ya sia I think we do alot more than ""just driving"" lol",btohqsg
Tarhan security uncle shouting at us 🤣🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Navigating and locating hdb units is a skill k🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Then must have thick skin to hiong parking at the right places,btohqsg
No $5/trip incentive don't waste time,btohqsg
Ya man. Becomes a good skill,btohqsg
Kena all the food deliveries is like doing marathon. The old app. Have to faster clock then can take next order,btohqsg
... where got $5/trip incentive one...,btohqsg
By the time reach become cold food,btohqsg
Who do this trip? Unless stack.But rather don't take.Must boycott these kind of crap fares,btohqsg
Many of my customers have commented llm very expensive 🙄,btohqsg
👆like that still expensive? Ask them to send by pigeona,btohqsg
I think ppl are used to +$2-$5 for food deliveries  cos of macdonalds and grabfood,btohqsg
So paying +$10 alrdy very ex,btohqsg
If  each shop can have their own cohort of drivers  of coz cheaper.sometimes go thru few hands before comes to llm  all parties want to earn  how cheap can it be?,btohqsg
Ya lorProblem is restaurants and home biz owners want to pay price equivalent to having their own driversOr as if they have so many locations @ $5 per drop,btohqsg
Anyway  based on current fares  not worth to do. At least that's how I feel,btohqsg
+ parking fees  time to go up to collect & deliver,btohqsg
Hourly less than $15Use ebike do fpGot 20/hrNo cost,btohqsg
Too bad im using car. Llm supposed to be help supplement when I'm free. End up doesn't help me. Haha.Maybe I'm doing it wrong,btohqsg
"No la i realise that the whole idea of doing things ""on the way"" like hitch or delivery to earn some kopi money works only in theoryIn reality it holds up a lot of your time and not sure if that kopi money is worth it",btohqsg
It works only if its really very on the way like exact same pickup and drop off,btohqsg
That's why  I will on hold for abit. Maybe when I have more free time  able to do it properly  it can be useful to me,btohqsg
Panda hourly 16 motor if fast,btohqsg
Batch 4  if batch 1 pay can reach 20/hour,btohqsg
Also depends fp love u boMy friend alway tio far pickup😂😂,btohqsg
Used to lala full time but now i see the fare i oso switch it up to pink shirt alrdy,btohqsg

Order deliver within 1hr nothing wrong ma,btohqsg
Lead time for cancellation  esp advance job  is imptIf u really need to cancel  the earlier the better,btohqsg
"When u order macs online or grabfood... They show delivery time will take 60minU will think its ok or feel ""wah so long""",btohqsg
I hope too rates resume like before,btohqsg
Busy doing a stack job didnt notice this- $2 tips payable by customer $XXalready paid. Damn confusing  thought the tips will be credited  which wasn't to be.,btohqsg
So please check the tips & priority fee to see if separate or combined.,btohqsg
He drop my rating cos I use 30 min to deliver his food from Yishun to Boon Lay,btohqsg
Call me 3 time asking what time will reach how long will reach wtf,btohqsg
Delivering a car order from brotzeit raffles to admiralty. Was shocked to see 12 bags of food waiting to be delivered. Filled up my whole boot with 10 bags and 2 more in the backseat. No mention of the number of bags  or that this job required an additional helper for this job under the order remarks.Is this acceptable? Not sure if it exceeds the weight limit of 20kg. But 12 bags are way over the size limit.,btohqsg
Siao siaoThe app jus now suddenly sign out on its own,btohqsg
"The worst i did for car order was 6 bags from arnold""s fried chicken.  12 bags really wtf sia",btohqsg
You can choose to rejectOr advise customer upgrade to mpv,btohqsg
Exactly. And the restaurant had the audacity to say ‘you don’t have a helper with you?’,btohqsg
Don’t deduct rental and petrol definitely hit $4000,btohqsg
What issit abt the new app interface that makes it very hard to visually follow when new jobs come in,btohqsg
Everytime a new job appears i lost which one i was looking at,btohqsg
Almost slide a wrong job when the order jumped 🙄,btohqsg
Advance job change to Pick Up Now is 30 mins - last time was 20 mins,btohqsg
As long need walk more than 1 trip1 ask them cancel,btohqsg
..... Thats right....its the way it jumpsOld interface will push the jobs up/downNow the screen just keeps changing in a flash  visually very confusing,btohqsg
And last time when new job comes in it wont keep jumping up if u halfway scrollingArgh,btohqsg
Llm don't go town go where,btohqsg
Make me expose my hideout haiz,btohqsg
Wow how much for this man. 1 location or multi stop,btohqsg
Item took already. Customer cancel his order. Lol,btohqsg
Got contract one meh. Haha. They help remove for free H,btohqsg
Omg selegie to cck $14 zzz,btohqsg
Now lalamove can we stack within same time?,btohqsg
Can stack as much as u want but once delay deliver those customers will cpcb,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone experienced this? Got an order but the restaurant say the order other driver take liao. Call Lala and live chat like no use de. What should I do ah,btohqsg
Low fare = low motivation  Cheers 🍻,btohqsg
Not even do 1 pick today fare si beh sian,btohqsg
Panjang to jurong to panjang back. Lol,btohqsg
I go drop 2 panjang first,btohqsg
Gd. Dun like some pple to follow stop by stop🙈,btohqsg
Erm by right you have toSome customers put the sequence according to which of their customers order firstAlso becos the price is based on dist covered by that sequence,btohqsg
But sometimes customers ok with switching ard  u can ask first,btohqsg
Hope they dont make changes to festive surcharge 😞,btohqsg
I kena before. Live chat and cso ask why I never call before head down. Suck thumb don't wanna waste time with cso just move o n,btohqsg
Sometime call the shop  they also no ans.,btohqsg
Thats what I said. CSO don't bother somemore ask me have I been to the training bla bla bla... I don't wanna waste time talking to assholes. So I just ignore and move on. Just unlucky,btohqsg
Then some tell you DO NOT CALL TO CONFIRMLol,btohqsg
Ya lor. Actually I don't understand why need to call the shop to cfm the order though.,btohqsg
It's actually more applicable to standard goods delivery rather than foodWith goods and parcels it is to double check item  dimensions and loading access,btohqsg
True. For food I don't think need to call to cfm the order. Is wasting our time to call them,btohqsg
"Just press ""call""Than end the call",btohqsg
Morning .... anyone know McPherson mall... any grace period,btohqsg
No need to go in car park. Park along the vicinity,btohqsg
Anyone did this SinSin restaurant delivery?,btohqsg
I thought u ask them to remove😂,btohqsg
I am stacking so wondering they are the punctual or always late or can take a bit earlier,btohqsg
Stacking 3 orders to CCK area,btohqsg
Punctual. Maybe early 5mins or so. Got asked before then they say they haven't cut the meat or something.,btohqsg
The order chit also write prepared like 5mins early but you can try go there early see loh cause also no need to pay parking.,btohqsg
Dun want wait. I try try pull then all van pull out,btohqsg
"""Priority Fee"" put under ""Payable by customer"" means we should collect the priorty fees at point of collection?",btohqsg
Just sharing: while waiting for food  myself and some llm drivers chatting on how inefficient of the new app. This particular llm driver came up to us and say Hey nothing to complain llm is giving us opportunity to make a living. And the new app they have invested to help drivery guys. We kept quiet and we walked off...... he is a llm true supporter,btohqsg
Hi do we collect priority fee from customer or lala will pay us automatically?,btohqsg
The settle fees at the end.. Don't press.. The merchant will have to press.. That's where the priority fees will be paid.. No need collect money,btohqsg
The back room team called me the other day  coz the merchant complained to them I refuse to leave and demanded a tip,btohqsg
But the app says tip ma.. Collect from customer..Then it was clarified by the lalamove back room team that it was done this way so we can interact more with customer.,btohqsg
And the backroom team are still learning the app too,btohqsg
Lol end of the day alot drivers switch no drivers then llm will be looking to improve and their BLOODY CS lolz,btohqsg
He just started llm is it lol,btohqsg
