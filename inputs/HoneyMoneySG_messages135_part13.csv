Does anyone have problems with using HSBC revo online? I realise a lot of my online transactions keep getting rejected when I try to use that card to pay (grab  Kris  restaurants qr),btohqsg
Check your online banking to view the recent card transactions  if looks normal .. Please call hsbc to check. Your card could be blocked because scammers tried to use it but blocked by hsbc. Happened to me before.,btohqsg
Hi guys just wanna clarify. For yuu card  if I have no plans to clock 600 per month  and just wanna use it for the occasional purchase at breadtalk or some other merchant  is it better if I clock it under uob plat visa instead for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Just receive 80 cash coupon.Funded on 10sep.,btohqsg
1) MYR is 6th category on top of your selected 5 categories.2) yes if spend on the selected categories. Charge in MYR and Amaze converts to SGD.3) If exceed 312.5 in the category switch to use Maybank FnF direct without amaze  get 8% under the MYR category  MYR category also capped at 312.5 spend.,btohqsg
Hi  are there physical retail shops located in Singapore that sell stuff priced in foreign currencies?Please provide some info if you know of such stores. Thanks very much!,btohqsg
So that means to reach $800 min spend optimally I will need to spend $312.5 on 2 cat and a bit on JB ?,btohqsg
hmm can spend in your 5+1 categories,btohqsg
Sorry gurus  I would like to seek your advice on HSBC ega please. I am planning to open an account in person tomorrow as I can't do so online (sorry Chris). Am I right that I only need to deposit 2000 for a start and deposit the rest of the amount probably on 30 Oct to get the maximum interest out of it please? Am I also right to assume I would only need to do 5 transfers within the month of November as I do not think I can get giro payment out so soon? Lastly  when should I send the SMS please? Is it from 1st Nov please? Thank you so much in advance,btohqsg
Interest calculation is based on monthly average balance  not based on last day of account balance.,btohqsg
How do I check merchant code ?Looking to search Bambo lab merchant code,btohqsg
Amaze + empty wallet is recommended,btohqsg
Bambo lab or Bambu lab ?,btohqsg

how do i use amaze wallet in Malaysia? saw that amaze wallet is better than youtrip but can i just use the amaze card linking it to my wallet instead of my credit cards? how do i change to use from my wallet first? and are there any benefits for using amaze wallet?,btohqsg
Do you have Amaze card now?Have you download the Instarem apps that is for Amaze card?,btohqsg
yes to both  i have my credit card linked to it but i have never used the wallet before,btohqsg
click ‚ÄúChange source‚Äù to wallet if you want it to deduct from your wallet.,btohqsg
wallet - better rates but only can topup from bank acct,btohqsg
suggest u open the account ASAP so that you can start applying for the GIRO bill payment. Also better to send sms for bonus interest in Oct  assuming interest rate is going to drop in Nov. Bonus interest is on monthly average balance. If your money is in a account with at least 3.2%  can FAST in $2005 once account open  FAST out 5x $1  keep 2k balance in Oct  then deposit the bulk of your savings on 1 Nov before 5pm.,btohqsg
So what the difference maybank f&F paired amaze and without paired with amaze? Only the low fx fee?,btohqsg
Pair with Amaze lower fx fees and converts to online spend in SGD. If want to clock under MYR category  cannot pair with Amaze and must be spending not in the selected categories or exceeded S$312.50 in the category.,btohqsg
also converts offline shopping to online,btohqsg
Thank you so much for the advice.,btohqsg
So for Maybank f&f is ntg help for this  right? Bcz maybank f&F is base on mcc  right?,btohqsg
