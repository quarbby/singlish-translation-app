Just trying to create a story.It's not common around the world.Yes lah  Singkie have a very bad habit commenting loudy as if in their own country.Malaysian must understand that sg visitors uses strong S$ to spend in jb and other states.  Just like jb... It was a dead state when we don't cross over. Biz was badly affected and closed down.I'm one that spend money in jb for food  entertainment and other stuff. Even car servicing and repairs are cheaper. It's common sense to stretch your dollars.Why is it 3.50 now....
