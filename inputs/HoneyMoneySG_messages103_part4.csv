Hi all experts  I have completed 20 days for 6.8% but how do I withdraw out? In addition  the interest short fall also üòíThis is my first time joining their 6.8% campaign.Thanks,btohqsg
i remember need to wait abit for them to credit the difference,btohqsg
Oh so I just click redeem will do?,btohqsg
Too much trouble already and it will go higher by the end of the year  I‚Äôm currently on SCB X . So I‚Äôm considering other options   if splitting card will need to prepare even more cards than I already had . Ya it‚Äôs for commercial multiple shopsThanks for the suggestions   just want to confirm that UOB absolute 1.7% still works right ?,btohqsg
uob absolute nerf from 6 May,btohqsg
Why not put money into interactive brokers to earn higher interest ? Maybe it is time to get off the UOB boat ?,btohqsg
IBKR need to have 100K invested as part of term and condition right?,btohqsg
That is right . UOB up it to 150 k   so I reckon one can move 100k over to interactive broker and keep 50k in their existing UOB to fund their daily expenses .,btohqsg
Of course   money  would be subject to broker risks,btohqsg
hello  may i knw where should i see this? i think i have completed my 20 days too,btohqsg
Anyone have problem using xnap now? :),btohqsg
what's the best way to make payment for quarterly MCST fees?,btohqsg
You can try to contact moomoo if you track and found shortfall. They will try to give top-up more but don't expect to get full 6.8% p.a. ü§£,btohqsg
You may scroll up to read on discussions about this,btohqsg
As shared -https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/192258. UOB is just not giving us additional  interest. Leaving 50k as monies for daily use,btohqsg
Actually interactive broker LLC is Cash Balance and it is insured by the FDIC for a certain amount. Definitely more than $100k but I forget exact.The interest rates could change daily and it only pays on balances above $xk. First $x earns no interest.I would not feel there is much risk to keep cash in interactive brokers. Withdrawal is not instant and takes anything from 2 hours to 24 hours depending if u submitted before cutoff time of the currency.Moomoo tiger webull on the other hand are different. My comments do not apply for them.,btohqsg
I vaguely remember it was $750k but my brain is rusty and I don‚Äôt have good internet to google now.,btohqsg
Could be they take out additional insurance on top of it,btohqsg
Just to be 100% sure  say I have 140k currently in my UOB One (and my March MAB is about 110k)  and will be depositing 50k from another bank. But within a month I need to withdraw 120k out from UOB.I will not be able to qualify for the Big Savings Payout Promo right?,btohqsg
Hi ! Does anyone have problems with xnap app today ?,btohqsg

Wonder if lloyds can really cover to that amt if it goes tits up,btohqsg
But i have been with ibkr for a long time  just worried once peterffy passes away  what happens,btohqsg

Hi experts  I can‚Äôt setup citipayall to pay for stamp duty fees. Is this transaction type not allowed?,btohqsg
Just thinking aloud. Since it's near end April  is it better to transfer the fund from CPFIS account to CFPOA so that it earns interest from CPF since interest is paid on month end balance of OA?,btohqsg
There's a lack of dp because not many are using this card. Based on my research  your $600 should be split to this. I might be wrong  DBS yuu cardholders please correct me.Assuming your DBS yuu card is linked to your yuu account.10x yuu points - Pay with DBS yuu card (6000 yuu points  credit within 14 days after transaction posted)26x yuu points - Meet $600 qualified spend  capped at $78 or 15600 yuu points  in calendar month (15600 yuu points  credit within 60 days after calendar month)It seems like your 10x yuu points may be split to:1. 1x yuu points (600 yuu points credited on transaction)2. 9x yuu points (5400 yuu points credited after transaction posted),btohqsg
600 yuu points on spot after scanning QR code  given that it‚Äôs not excluded item5400 yuu points few days later after the transaction was posted15 600 yuu points in the end of the next month,btohqsg
Thanks for confirming üëçüèªEven if linked  still need scan the yuu ID? Based on the website says need  but t&c says no need.,btohqsg
Cpf interest is calculated based on the lowest value of the month. Transferring back the money doesn‚Äôt not impact the interest for that month,btohqsg
CPF don't see the month end balance. They see the monthstartbalanceminus anything withdrawn  so the deposited amount only count from May.You also get charged $2+ for that transaction  so you lose the interest for the $2+ on Apr also.,btohqsg
