dont need to search I know O Level can go foundation diploma anywhere,btohqsg
So what is the point of your answer,btohqsg
foundational diploma --> diploma --> bachelor,btohqsg
We have alr qualified this by saying depends on private institutions either ways u end up with more toliet paper for your anus,btohqsg
Just this time in more debt,btohqsg
But most people in my school join sec 5 first 😁 before going to pfp,btohqsg
U mean those that are unable to secure a place in PFP on their first attempt join Sec 5. Yes,btohqsg
no those wait for their O level subject results join sec 5 first,btohqsg
then withdraw when they receive they results,btohqsg
That's for those who wanna gamble la,btohqsg
Cedric did the safe play with DPP which is even more common cuz 1 more extra year u guaranteed a spot vs the gamble of Olevels.,btohqsg
Then those that cannot stay in Sec 5 end up results damn cui then end up in ITE again. Eh that one also quite common,btohqsg
Why go ite when can go private international school,btohqsg
Called no marni or parents dw pay,btohqsg
N Level students after receiving results for their O Level subjects in January they withdraw from sec 5 and apply for pfp,btohqsg
Ah boy u need to brush up on your comprehension,btohqsg
U have to qualify by saying IF their results good enough,btohqsg
people get 10 points + English Grade 4 --> Sec 5,btohqsg
Everything is an IF even a conditional offer from EAE,btohqsg
three sec 5 classes become two when pfp students left,btohqsg
Below that ppl can also stay if their PFP choices are dumb and all kena rejected,btohqsg
PFP for Nlevel students now like a fucking lottery liao,btohqsg
English Grade 4 cant go to PFP,btohqsg
Idk choosing all SP and NP for your choices,btohqsg
if they pick all science and their score above 8,btohqsg
science is for the 3-7 pointers,btohqsg
Yeah which is why I also said the 14 pt makes sense from my POV as I was from applied science,btohqsg
I heard new system g3 (exp) can also go pfp,btohqsg
actually got people get 8 points and did not qualify for PFP,btohqsg
I didn’t take any o level subs,btohqsg
thank god I didn’t take Sec 5,btohqsg
Id struggle with English and science,btohqsg
In this case u just waiting for the PFP deadline.. set that way for those who did.,btohqsg
for people who struggle with English only they have no choice but to go Sec 5,btohqsg
Because if they fuck up beyond 19 it's in their EMB3,btohqsg
They don't qualify for Sec 5,btohqsg
i mean struggle with english only,btohqsg
some people English Grade 4 Math Grade 1 Science Grade 1 MT Grade 1 Humanities 1 still go Sec 5,btohqsg
