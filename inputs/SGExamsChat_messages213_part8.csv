places to zhut zhut and piak piak,btohqsg
NUS FASS folks (regardless of major)  what was your experience like,btohqsg
If I'm at any void deck it's so that I can pet those fur children,btohqsg
Tbh itâ€™s very diff to answer like that because experiences in diff majors are vastly diff,btohqsg
Haha I mean I know that diff major will have diff experience  but because the major I want is like really niche  so I guess the next best bet is to hear from everyone elseðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Is it the env one? Haha,btohqsg
It's a major within ELL dept,btohqsg
Oh that HAHA the one thatâ€™s so niche ppl forget abt,btohqsg
Folks seem to have fun with it,btohqsg
what are the most niche majors across all the 6 autonomous unis  just curious,btohqsg
I define that as majors that are so small and unheard of that a student might not even remember that it exists,btohqsg
"science majors seem to be really represented no matter how ""obscure"" it is",btohqsg
i think envt science is more well known than computational biology,btohqsg
there are niche science stuff too?,btohqsg
in jc no one knew what computational bio was  but environment science more ppl knew abt it,btohqsg
thats true haha  I've heard of computational bio in passing but never really went to find out about it,btohqsg
NTU ADM and NUS DID are rather niche places also imo  it's definitely not the typical STEM/liberal arts deal,btohqsg
but ntu adm known for one the lowest rp?,btohqsg
same for that  one of the lowest rp?,btohqsg
Social work is a major  today I learned,btohqsg
there's suss social work bsc also,btohqsg
ah I've heard of the SUSS one,btohqsg
I'm just surprised that there's one in FASS too cos FASS has always emphasised on offering only non-professional majors if I'm not wrong,btohqsg
This one low rp but need portfolio and all that  so it's probably 100% ABAS,btohqsg
adm offers a BFA so the non-academic admission component is compulsory,btohqsg
might try for that if my rp cmi for FASS,btohqsg
As a current FASS student  never heard such thing,btohqsg
I believe Dr Robin Loon was the one who said it in his TS FAQ on youtube back in July or August,btohqsg
I had to google this person so this person doesn't have the authority to speak for FASS HAHA it's his opinion,btohqsg
"i guess its worth clarifying what you mean by ""non-professional"" also?",btohqsg
haha basically general degree  non conservatory and not like doctor/lawyer/engineer,btohqsg
I think 90% of uni courses are also general degrees so,btohqsg
I see engineering as a general degree also,btohqsg
"there's a specific language around ""professional degree"" btw. medicine  law  engineering  accountancy  can be considered ""professional degrees"" cus actually beyond the degree  there is a component of additional professional certifications.",btohqsg
so that might be what he meant. Social work is traditionally not a professional degree  but the industry is increasingly creating more professional certifications around it.,btohqsg
Is definitely not as specialised as certain majors,btohqsg
"at a more layman level  many majors have relatively structured and mainstream career options (even if not considered ""professional degrees""). in FASS  this may include Comms&NewMedia leading to advertising  PR  or design type work.",btohqsg
then there's majors that don't have clear obvious career outcomes  like History. the most direct and clearcut career option for that would be to go into academia  research  etc. But these much more general degrees usually build broad perspectives and critical thinking  more than tangible hard skills.,btohqsg
it was not in response to you  it was an attachment to illustrate your comment on engineering degrees HAHA,btohqsg
What do u think about the common line of thought that having such degrees won't help you get a job?,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qfrpoc74UwYDid a panel discussion previously (kinda long) that talked about this. Essentially  the responsibility of your employability lies in your hands at the end of the day. Some degrees directly prep you for certain jobs because its influenced by workforce needs and Manpower Ministry  Trade/Industry Ministry.More general degrees also exist because people are people and should be allowed to pursue their interests.1. These general degrees are great at broadening horizons and perspectives. This is useful at higher levels of leadership and management  but you tend to struggle at early stage of career without clear hard skills.2. To better support yourself  be more involved in initiatives and projects outside of school  and build up some form of entry-level job skills. whether its writing  marketing  design  project management.,btohqsg
"HAHA I'd tell those ppl  especially those that are speaking from exp  you just didn't know how to pivot your course properly to get a job. Based on what I observe from my seniors  those that got a job effortlessly despite having such ""general degrees"" they don't take modules just to fulfil grad criteria/for CAP. Aside from compulsory mods  the mods they choose  they have specific personal outcomes they wanna achieve from the mod.",btohqsg
I mean the fact that I'm willing to go straight to FASS should be an indicator that I'm very aware of the kind of job opportunities that there are despite some misinformation going around haha,btohqsg
I've kinda already started planning my mods,btohqsg
I agree strongly on point 1.,btohqsg
General degrees in my opinion are good for people who already know what they want to do and how they can get there,btohqsg
i also intend to end up in a career not related to my major,btohqsg
I mean... since when was anything easyðŸ‘€,btohqsg
If you are crazy  then I am too,btohqsg
bump. If any1 has a good location apart from Tampines Hub  do lmk. Thanks!,btohqsg
