I strongly advise you against taking China Studies in Chinese if youâ€™re struggling in O level CL because you need to remember  youâ€™re not just learning it in Chinese  you need to know those technical terms in Chinese. Those technical terms are another level.,btohqsg
tbh no la h1 still learn more shit than olevel,btohqsg

CSC goes beyond speaking mandarin at home lol. Like what is diplomacy  cybersecurity  colonisation in CL?,btohqsg

If u just like chinese  prob cll is better,btohqsg
No  you donâ€™t go for CSC to up your CL game  you need to up your CL game before CSC. China Studies no matter the medium is already a very demanding subject  you donâ€™t want medium to be another problem.,btohqsg
U want large to be a problem,btohqsg
