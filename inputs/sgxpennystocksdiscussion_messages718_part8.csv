Mun Siong seems too stable.High chance privatisation.#lowballseason,btohqsg
Here’s why .- Current market price suppressed- recent results showed red- NAV $0.09x-  ranging too tightly $0.048 to $0.050 even weak market- holding cash of $36 mil before they bought a new property recentlyMarket cap as of now $28m when they hold cash 💰 of $32mil and little debt.Using bad results to suppressed price down and then can do a Low ball offer. My view.,btohqsg
How about oxpay? Sleep for so long,btohqsg
Seems like got accumulation recently and with insider ceo buying . Got chance to break out downtrend when time comes,btohqsg

I actually buy Hong Fok much higher.Cuz when the market was Chui previously  it built a base and held on there. Then when market rebounded it’s macd turned green. But still seems to be pressed down.I do agree 940 is a support  if today can close higher  maybe a double bottom play. I see good rrr here.,btohqsg

Market sentiments led up by  GEAR  Parkson Retail moved suddenly. Pollux stubborn but BBs inside  very patient. I think this round they will not fight against the momentum .Hence  watch Pollux closely anytime.Should be coming.,btohqsg
now can break    cos of GEAR news,btohqsg
if GEAR  takeover  investors only left GEO to buy !!!,btohqsg
Added Pollux $0.044. Lets go. they should be more than ready now,btohqsg
