🎉Pika World Weekend Markets Update🎉Given the geopolitical risk in Russia  we could expect some weakness in the broader market although it could be contained.While saw some selling continuation  we are zooming into 20-day MA. A re-test and bounce up could help build liquidity for the index  otherwise  we could see a continuation of the downward spiral.,btohqsg
"The reason why are aren't full bear yet although the odds are building for SPY is because  if you compare the red channel and the blue channel  there is a ""tapering"" going on.In our trading channel  we often discuss this as a slow down in selling or buying. In this case  the selling is getting gentler.Hence  we are mindful of this choppiness.Have a great remaining weekend. Catch up tomorrow.Pika Nat🌻",btohqsg
