Like I’m referring ur sch mates who transfer from MI to JC  if they could have retook some o level subjects while in Mi they could’ve used those scores to jae into a better jc,btohqsg
be grabfood delivery yk that guy say make 5k,btohqsg
speaking of which i shld get supper,btohqsg
this guy is damn bipolar  he can argue against smth then later change his words and pretend he never see properly,btohqsg
wah i legit gg to leave this chat imagine they all legit lurk this channel then search thru my msgs,btohqsg
they have the score to go JC,btohqsg
Then when delivery accident your leg kena bang and disabled u forced to retire with no money wonder what went wrong,btohqsg
ownself nvr buy insurance my problem or the guy problem,btohqsg
gig job but don't spend the money to protect youself,btohqsg
atp you need to defend for yourself,btohqsg
i keep seeing those monks that have to vote to go into the thai army,btohqsg
Bro I mean by right that's why gig jobs are so attractive,btohqsg
their face after they get selected,btohqsg
Short term ok u take the money hit and run,btohqsg
anyways imma sleep I can't take this shit anymore,btohqsg
Ya but I mean if they suddenly wanted to transfer they might have wanted to retake some o level subjects so can go into a jc with better score,btohqsg
Long term bro gg gig jobs cannot do long term one,btohqsg
my uncle drive grab taxi also make 4-5k...be it the maintenance of a bike is lesser,btohqsg
atb for tmr rose  please get through the day without getting beaten up,btohqsg
So that’s why I say it’s unfortunate they don’t have the option cos they can’t register while in MI,btohqsg
If my grandmother had wheels she would have been a bike,btohqsg
they're burnt out by structured curriculum in school - they won't do better in an unstructured  self-motivated curriculum to do private Os,btohqsg
grab taxi need >26 or smth dumb,btohqsg
i wanted to drive grab while waiting for uni,btohqsg
idk if i can even get through tmr without sleeping and complaining for the 100000th time,btohqsg
U making comparison to different gigs wdf bro,btohqsg
my class is so antisocial with the introverts bro,btohqsg
Hmm yes but like since o level can combine 2 years  if they focus all their energies into improving their score for 1-2 subjects I think they will actually improve,btohqsg
yea true..thats why i did say the maintenance has to be taken into account,btohqsg
Hello uncle irwen holland village please,btohqsg
I’m thinking if I should take MC,btohqsg
Scdf I have to be careful not to take more than 30 in a calendar year,btohqsg
8hrs under hot sun vs 8hrs in aircon...i think in sg weather and context  its clear..too bad theres a age requirement,btohqsg
Nah I will go polyclinic if I need,btohqsg
plus because of our size...a $50 fare does not take 2-3hrs to accomplish,btohqsg
not an eventuality - if i were a teacher i wld discourage my students from doing that but instead try to help them be better at their current subjects,btohqsg
I’m referring to your sch mates who wanted to transfer lol. Since they dead set on leaving MI they might have wanted to retake if they could to just go to a better JC,btohqsg
But then also it may have been too late by the time they decided to leave,btohqsg
nah idt they wldve wanted to either,btohqsg
If I were a teacher I would say do as I say not as I do,btohqsg
@esch123japanese stall finally opened for 2-3 weeks in a row,btohqsg
Even if retaking o level subs as private was allowed,btohqsg
Actually Private candidate should take new subjects,btohqsg
It was open most of the time,btohqsg
It's a gamble but if it pays off it pays off big,btohqsg
Is the juice stall still there,btohqsg
The Japanese stall is manned buy the aunty’s son,btohqsg
Idk that has changed  if it’s changed means both the juice stall and Japanese stall are run by new ppl,btohqsg
and why am i still awake,btohqsg
cause you cant sleep like us,btohqsg
wait actually that i dun think it is python,btohqsg
It's better to have someone do it,btohqsg
Liverpool making me loose my sanity,btohqsg
Is it run by an old aunty?,btohqsg
i think so? but i don't really notice who is running the juice stall,btohqsg
don't rlly see anyone going to that stall leh,btohqsg
Then is the Japanese stall run by some Chinese guy without specs,btohqsg
Do they still have $2.50 curry rice with chicken cutlet,btohqsg
bit of a slightly cursed idea: what if Jack Neo saw Top Gun  then inspired by that movie  decided that for his next Ah Boys to Men film  he'd make it about fighter pilots?Or in simpler terms: Top Gun  but it's an Ah Boys to Men series movie,btohqsg
they did the navy theme so it would have been possible,btohqsg
Jiayous!! I love chem  may i impart some love to u🤣,btohqsg

LOL he knows about that incident its joeverrrr,btohqsg
Wah why is it so popular,btohqsg
THEN WHY PUT US IN SAME CLASS 🤡,btohqsg
I think it is the sch leaders that settled the class  like usually there is a standard order they wanna put classes,btohqsg
I think mostly is by l1r5  i guess ip is by gpa (?),btohqsg
theres 2 classes with BCMe why cannot put him in that class/hj,btohqsg
i got 3.54 the girl behind me got 4.0,btohqsg
she take BCMg i take BCMH,btohqsg
IP gpa same as poly is it? Like A is 4  and so on?,btohqsg
I lazy explain but the closer to 4 the better,btohqsg
Oh i was referring to per subj combi at least for my sch is by l1r5,btohqsg
Tho idk how i got into the better CMEp class,btohqsg
I was literally q close to the cop,btohqsg
Come to think of it mindef has yet to make a series on the air force...we saw two for the navy alr  Grit and the passage  then army got every Singaporean son and uncommon grit,btohqsg
Uk they group my l1r5 right then we will see all the top classes is the same few classes💀💀,btohqsg
My batch got 2 full class of CMEp (s411  s412)  and 1 full class of CMEb (s413),btohqsg
My batch has a mega hybrid cohort💀💀,btohqsg
My batch is q huge 800+,btohqsg
I heard val batch mix CMEp and CMEb into 2 classes,btohqsg
Theres a whole tele grp asking if there are fuel snipers at woodlands or tuas 🤣,btohqsg

I take the circle line everyday peak hr during poly  oh that's super true,btohqsg
Then I stay long enough after lesson peak hr back home in the opposite direction 😭,btohqsg
My lessons are during office start hours💀💀,btohqsg
i think full pcme/bcme is by gpa or l1r5 but the rojak classes is by subj,btohqsg
Make sense but i will feel damn unlucky if i pcme and then in a rojak class,btohqsg
I think this is for multiple classes w same subj combi,btohqsg
but theres also ppl taking quirky combi like BCmG BCmH   BCMCLL,btohqsg
ik there was this snr who took lit computing math and geog,btohqsg
Ur sch has got many subject combi,btohqsg
but this one need to appeal,btohqsg
i end like 5pm most days,btohqsg
ppl in my class who take 3h2 1h1 humans have alot of free periods,btohqsg
I think maybe she wants comp sci,btohqsg
Usually they prioritise them over the 4h2,btohqsg
i have 1 free period on thurs that is 1h 20min long,btohqsg
But idk my batch only had 1 class of mix 3h2 1h1 and 4h2,btohqsg
Coz there were only 6 BCME,btohqsg
then my friend taking BCMe has like 4 1h free periods per week,btohqsg
cause the 1h is my h2 hist lessons,btohqsg
Like excluding recess got 1 more free period?,btohqsg
"the gps js said ""you are on the fastest route  you will be arriving at your destination at 11:09pm""",btohqsg

Never felt the need to make friends In sec school so just went through just meeting my classmates  but most.of my classmates made their own clique so I just left them to their own friends,btohqsg
I see their insta stories still  enjoying life etc,btohqsg
i can only see myself contacting like 2 after o lvls,btohqsg

like if you apply hall means you're gonna accept the offer alr ma so why wouldn't you,btohqsg
or apply before getting an offer,btohqsg
anyway there's application fees for hall so no point paying for it before you even confirm,btohqsg
Hmm ya he was the major opposition figure in the 80s  but once he left CST became the defacto LO,btohqsg

A bit funny that CSJ is the only guy there that never got into parliament,btohqsg
i think hes my sec sch junior...,btohqsg
had always found him to be weird back then...,btohqsg
it feel like this person likes the idea of studying law instead of wanting to study law,btohqsg
alot of ppl are bashing him abt wanting to ck oso,btohqsg
but then based off his comments idk,btohqsg
If he's a lawyer in the future literally anyone can be a lawyer,btohqsg
arent most junior lawyers being replaced with ai anyways,btohqsg
Also not the mylady88 guy getting dragged with him,btohqsg
"""It’s just my imagination. I didn’t even ck yet. I was quite guai in BMT and only skipped one conduct to see MO and take meds.""",btohqsg

How to downpes (dun u need a valid reason) and LOL,btohqsg
tbh 78.75rp is q decent tho (but i cant fully put myself in his shoes la like if i actually scored that and was aiming for sth would i hv retook A levels),btohqsg
Actually Chiam led the SDP but he fell out with CSJ over some stupid accident which should never have happened,btohqsg
Oh thought that was lhl Dopplerdanger,btohqsg
SMU GPA is out of 4?,btohqsg
Oh anyway the party logo below was from the party Chiam founded which is the SPP,btohqsg
Yea knew the logo so thought it was someone else lol,btohqsg
One of OP’s reply got -122 downvotes💀,btohqsg
How does the bots work so fast that i dun actually see the message,btohqsg
I don’t know what to say but I guess some people get lucky and some don’t,btohqsg
I’ve decided to retake cos I rly want the A,btohqsg
Wish u all the best!! Can one if u fundamentally understand stuff  read / practice qns,btohqsg
At least for math/science subjects it’s like if you have the skills since the answer is more fixed you can be more certain of the A if you can do well in timed practices for TYS  arts subjects can’t say the same,btohqsg
I wonder if I should try your Cher’s tip of writing in point form,btohqsg
If I do I hope they actually accept my answers,btohqsg
Yes if u are not gonna finish the paper and u know how to point form,btohqsg
Like point form w writing the key words still etc,btohqsg
Alright  I suppose I should avoid it but if the last qn I’m rly running short on time then I’ll try point form,btohqsg
Tbh i would say econs is an in between (it has standard ways of answering and it can be honed),btohqsg
It rly depends on the qn I guess,btohqsg
But maybe some ppl find it harder to understand the concept wise,btohqsg
Some are like basically the same as qns that have been tested before in past TYS or sch exams some are like never seen before,btohqsg
Yt should take alvl h2 triple science and h1 geog as the contrasts,btohqsg
For concepts I got most of them  I think my main issue is still time management,btohqsg
Wait can u actually do that,btohqsg
I’ve had classmates coming to me to ask for help for like some basic concepts cos they still couldn’t understand them but then a levels they got A,btohqsg
I think the starting point is to know what went wrong,btohqsg
Nah you should’ve seen last year’s csq1,btohqsg
As private you can take wtv you want  as school candidate  i dont think any school will allow this extent of quirkiness,btohqsg
It is a problem if u dunno where went wrong,btohqsg
Tbh every year got tricky qns it just depends on how tricky Cambridge wants to make it,btohqsg
Once in a while then there rly are like super standard qns where you can just vomit out the whole answer,btohqsg
I rather have a paper of moderate difficulty,btohqsg
Vomiting is possible in o lvl coz there are content qns,btohqsg
But ofc not in a lvl,btohqsg
Like not everything tricky but also not everything bog standard,btohqsg
Once in a while there are super standard essay qns which students may have done before in tuition classes or in sch lol,btohqsg
Like the 2019 essay qn on vaccines is so easy  don’t rly have any tricks but the 2022 one on street lights is slightly more complicated,btohqsg

If anyone thinks they need tuition in uni they probably shouldn’t be there,btohqsg
oh its like the telegram channel will post ppl seeking tuition and tutors who are interested can sign up,btohqsg
lmao there someone keep on coming to the ite chats promoting tuition for ite💀,btohqsg
Wtf  Singaporeans are so kiasu there is now tuition for almost everything,btohqsg
For poly tuition they would be like come to us for your 4.0 GPA,btohqsg
it wasn't exactly tuition  it was a discord server for u to seek help with ur work,btohqsg
Oh I thought you mean like private or group tuition,btohqsg
Like they actually go for classes,btohqsg
Then it’s not as insane as I thought,btohqsg
and is like vv repetitive  keep on sending,btohqsg
So the tuition is meant to be for who?,btohqsg
If it’s not meant for ite students idk why would they keep spamming,btohqsg
i ban idk how many times,btohqsg

My cca always had laptops to game on so all the classmates close to would come to my cca just to use the laptops..rmb once we were doing headcount.The teacher was mystified after realising how many students were in the class,btohqsg
There was like 5 extra heads,btohqsg
i see my sec sch juniors in public  i legit want to run away,btohqsg
I saw my juniors literally could not see any leading the cca or becoming a leader,btohqsg
Honestly when I think about it  I could have. But I was not more capable then the ones eventually choose to lead for my cohort.Nor for the cohort after mine but the 3rd cohort was a diff story,btohqsg
I was sec 5 then so I knew who became the cca leader  he was not bad for one. The garbage one was the co-leader,btohqsg
Become co-leader but cannot plan  then ask teacher plan. Say not happy...,btohqsg
i mean ye sum of them q tall,btohqsg
The juniors eating a diff kind of diet,btohqsg
i dont rmb my cohort having that much of a disparity  maybe just cus its now from an outsiders perspective,btohqsg

idk but as someone from NA and sec 5  wont say all but about half of my sec 5 class that i know of went to poly  the rest either go ite or private uni  and for those who went ite also managed to find their way to uni. My point is sch vibes does matters  especially in the case of teacher's quality. personally i feel without my teachers in sec 5  i might not be able to score that well,btohqsg
tan(6theta) = tan(3)(2theta) = 2tan 3theta/ 1- tan^2(3theta)= 2tan(2theta+theta)/ 1- tan^2(2theta+ 1 theta)then u can solve from here,btohqsg
oh i dont take fmath i was just asking yt for fun but thanks,btohqsg
haha i also dont take fmath but you shld be able to do this in upper sec if you take Amath,btohqsg

actually i can get the points of those comments  coz it will be wasted if cambridge cant recognise the handwritting,btohqsg
"My friend got the comment""Consider the view that your handwriting confuses more than informs""Cuz she wrote a qn for gp:""Consider the view that the media confuses more than informs""",btohqsg
this one im pretty sure  it is not dementia,btohqsg
But they don't call it de moivre,btohqsg
But I think MOST recent batch,btohqsg
ok la  just that it's more of used using polar form then the actual version,btohqsg
Cuz they removed polar form rite,btohqsg
i thought now complex numbers is only cartesian form,btohqsg
so this is last year with polar,btohqsg
i think i can only remember chem phy and econs,btohqsg

(Me when I brute force the PNC qn),btohqsg
bruh i got called during lecture  me desparately wanna ask someone if i got it write coz i cant think on the spot...then awkward silence for 2s,btohqsg
luckily it was right  else my math cher will kill me during tutorial,btohqsg
"""MOE does not award marks based on tidyness""",btohqsg
you could be a good research candidate... to be researched,btohqsg
Suspected spinal cord injury  without evidence of spinal cord injury,btohqsg
Idk my handwriting also q bad,btohqsg
Cb js say u ck lah,btohqsg
real...but it does not award marks for illegible handwriting too,btohqsg
True  Cambridge awards the marks  not MOE,btohqsg
The doctor cannot find the injury,btohqsg
i mean your competition is yt,btohqsg
"""Cambridge does not award marks based on tidyness""",btohqsg
i cant imagine if i write on blank paper and not foolscap,btohqsg
someone cannot read means it is not already,btohqsg
i wanna take fmath but seeing that imma get f'd by math,btohqsg
anyone ever received their papers back from Cambridge to verify?,btohqsg
YT hand writing isn't that bad,btohqsg
Uk I considered paying to see my gp exam script,btohqsg
Ciz I wanted to see their comments,btohqsg
How much does it cost these days arh or isit even possible anymore,btohqsg
don't think can. Only can pay for them to review I think,btohqsg
i'd pay quite a bit to see my a levels paper,btohqsg
i write on paper vs i write on ipad sees different things,btohqsg
see wth i was doing back then,btohqsg
They don't cuz they scan your paper...,btohqsg
same actually  like i want to see my grades,btohqsg
i just wanna see my math tbh,btohqsg
how did i get an E,btohqsg
As someone who helped mark sch exam scripts before  it's a pain to read illegible handwriting.The only reason why school teachers endure it is because don't want students to come in droves to ask for marks,btohqsg
i like how we just wanna see the fucked up ones,btohqsg
but Cambridge don't have such problems,btohqsg
Tot it was 2 markers in 1 room if cannot they flag a chief marker if all 3 say cannot then that word is disregarded,btohqsg
So u gotta be so bad 3 random teachers cannot read it at all,btohqsg
1 of my cher said cambridge want keep it hidden becus scared of legal stuff lol,btohqsg
i'm at the point i get annoyed at my own writing if it's ugly,btohqsg
unless i'm just trudging through calculations,btohqsg
at least u got into NTU,btohqsg
i want to see my econs,btohqsg
oh yea i will keep rewriting if it is ugly,btohqsg
you honestly think the 2 markers who are colleagues rather go through more pain for a stranger who will never get back the paper to see?,btohqsg
this is if i’m scribbling out to check so idc the handwriting,btohqsg
i wonder what like stuff they gotta do differently on a day to day basis,btohqsg
By right I think that's what they suppose to do la.. by left they can just take a dartboard and do the scores that way and no one would know,btohqsg
In Humanities for Uni we fix that problem once and for all,btohqsg
imagine in their shoes and you have another 100 scripts waiting,btohqsg
in uni even for tests bc they just give as much paper as i want  i just write v big,btohqsg
It's called typing out your essay in Times New Roman,btohqsg
aye can cambridge markers work in normal schools afterwards?,btohqsg
untidy is ok  bordering on illegible not ok,btohqsg
"Teacher write this if you did not complete paper ""Cambridge does not award marks based on tidyness""",btohqsg
but combi sci practical are marked by local markers starting last year,btohqsg
Some are quite dedicated also I am pretty sure these days they would use algorithms to transcribe the words through scanner liao,btohqsg
That's what we do for logistics of mailing,btohqsg
how they even vet these markers anyways,btohqsg
they are school teachers who are trained.,btohqsg
do they have to live on a campus or smth oso,btohqsg
Just fix the issue using scanners and they transcribed it for us automatically then if cmi it goes into the bin for review,btohqsg
wldnt schs with these teachers have an advantage then?,btohqsg
That's pinning the hope on hitting a dedicated onevs just making it more legible,btohqsg
illegible handwriting is just not giving the examiners the respect they need,btohqsg
My point is that I legit think they just scan it and the system autotranscribes,btohqsg
should be teachers from many different schools. So still ok,btohqsg
The only exception is for the practical papers cuz legit the reason is the chemicals on the paper does not allow for it to be scanned,btohqsg
there was a documentary on it but for Oxford version of O lvlthey didn't transcribe it,btohqsg
for 99% of scripts  generally legible,btohqsg
i tot my cher mentioned before papers are now scanned instead of physically transported,btohqsg
cus of cases of papers lost during transit before,btohqsg
Or just use my mom’s ipad that she barely uses,btohqsg
recreation just use your mum's ipadif starting uni studies and using it for studying  recommend getting a new one,btohqsg
Should be ig? I write like shit also they can read one so tbh I think one needs to just past the reasonable person standard,btohqsg
As in u take your handwriting u go out and ask ppl if they can read it at random if cannot means u fucked up,btohqsg
I dunno if transcribing is a thing coz my cher was worried for me that cambridge cant read my ant-like handwriting💀💀 so she suggested i use ballpoint (which actually helped to get the words bigger),btohqsg
Yep after the papers lost in train incident  but scanning wun make the legibility any better (if not maybe even worst lol),btohqsg
doubt u wrote that badly.There are really bad ones. However  based on my understanding  most of these students just don't bother about grades.My handwriting isn't good too tbh. Just need to be legible,btohqsg
I do know that scanning is a thing tho something like on screen reading as SEAB says it,btohqsg
it was on the news I think,btohqsg
Yeah I remember after the paper lost issue it was raise in parliamentary questions,btohqsg
when i was s4  I remember having discussion with a friend on whether papers are flown to Cambridge  or Cambridge markers flown to SG,btohqsg
and we were wondering if flown to Cambridge  what happens if the plane crash,btohqsg
Used to be flown to Cambridge I think? Well not Cambridge Assessments,btohqsg
paper lost in train? think i heard of it but cant rmb wat happened,btohqsg
Cuz I remembered my Cher being damn anal about using friction pens,btohqsg
that marker left his briefcase in the train with all the scripts,btohqsg
I think even now friction pens just don't use cuz scanning and light might affect the inks chemistry and make it fade too,btohqsg
what happened to those students then?,btohqsg
cant imagine the horror of realization,btohqsg
I think they retake the papers,btohqsg
There was a December special session for them,btohqsg
Got a lot of noise about the stress of those students etc,btohqsg
But at the end of the day SEAB wins,btohqsg
they either retake or have a score that's based on sch prelims and similar standard sch candidates' O lvl score,btohqsg
they use the prelim grades to compute,btohqsg
the one i was referring to was A levels 2018,btohqsg
theres smt called saving contacts mah,btohqsg
i think 4 schools were affected (i only know SA  i cant remember which others),btohqsg
Usually moderation I can tell u SEAB very conservative one,btohqsg
It's honestly better to just retake if offered,btohqsg
oh think psle was liddat oso  if u cldnt attend(probly cus of covid) wld moderate based on the student above and below u in prelim and base on that or smth,btohqsg
Cuz the retaking size would be smaller and they can moderate much better,btohqsg
it just means prelims cannot play play,btohqsg
yes i know  but tbh it will do me good if it was a theory moderation off my prelims lol coz im pretty sure my prelims theory was better than my As,btohqsg
And also the difficulty won't be set to crazy levels like prelims,btohqsg
it was my prelims practical that gg,btohqsg
moderate based on their olvl score,btohqsg
but i think the 2018 incident was h2 chem p3 iirc,btohqsg
if ur prelim flying colors cant u just ck o lvl lol,btohqsg
but then ure gambling on if liddis ^ they oso do well,btohqsg
Honestly I will take the retake,btohqsg
As a person who has done SC twice it's not worth it,btohqsg
i didnt keep track of this  but the year before  some h2 chem p3 A level scripts were lost in the train iirc,btohqsg
if A1 then don't need bother retake,btohqsg
Dun think the grades are even shared..,btohqsg
The candidates dk their grades for the other papers,btohqsg
i think u need to decide first??? they not so stupid,btohqsg
Because of that incident  the setting of prelims also become … more important for the school to not anyhow make it incredibly difficult for the sake of it,btohqsg
Special consideration just removes that paper from consideration and moderate according to your other papers,btohqsg
some school (i should not name) deliberately set easy paper,btohqsg
I don’t think those schools do it in anticipation of their school’s scripts getting lost la,btohqsg
that one for a different reasons,btohqsg
cant say if thats lucky or unlucky lol,btohqsg
Following this procedure  about 91% (29 Candidates) of the affected candidates obtained at least a Pass grade  with about 63% (20 candidates) attaining distinctions  i.e. A1/A2. Almost all the affected candidates had been awarded better or the same grades for the O-Level Additional Mathematics as compared to their school preliminary examinations.,btohqsg
i say too much it will just make it more obvious which jc it is,btohqsg
and just nice 20 candidates from Nan Hua,btohqsg
I think my understanding is they were offered special consideration on top of their option to retake if they want,btohqsg
but maybe it is already very well known,btohqsg
Unlucky because both was with Maths,btohqsg
i wonder how a meeting liddat wld even be like,btohqsg
i assume wld have some meeting with the prelim setters?,btohqsg
The link wrote everythingSimilar to last year’s incident  Cambridge Assessment and SEAB will offer affected candidates the option of a re-examination of the Additional Mathematics Paper 2 on 15 February 2019. The results of the re-examination will be released by end-February 2019. Details of the registration for the re-examination have been provided by SEAB to the candidates on 14 January 2019  after they had received their result slips.,btohqsg
can get back the papers meh? i tot once they pass to cambridge u can't get it back,btohqsg
what if u opt to retake and ur grades worst  i wonder if u will be given option to retain ur better grades,btohqsg
