haha always. but for japanese  nissan is king. not even toyota can match. i wonder why,btohqsg
chinese regard US made german made as premier brands,btohqsg
Ya they like to compare n show off. Face is so impt,btohqsg
Car Review - Kia Sorento Hybrid 1.6 SX Tech 7-Seater (A)Thanks to its hybrid system  the 1.6-litre turbocharged engine is able to bring the sub 1.8-tonne SUV from a standstill to 100km/h in just 8.8 seconds.👉🏻 React with 😁 if the Kia Sorento Hybridisappealing!👉🏻 React with 🤔 if you aren’t feeling the Kia Sorento Hybrid!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
yes face. lke iphone. HIGHEST grade in class than their huawei,btohqsg
no volvo recharge? cant recharge yet i guess,btohqsg
Volvo was never a very popular car  even overseas.,btohqsg
anyway  got to give it to musk. he really is a brilliant engineer who looks far ahead,btohqsg
Mazda  was never a very popular car  even overseas.,btohqsg
small company small sales. family controlled,btohqsg
i always wonder. if tesla wants to reduce price to sell and yeat make a margin  shouldn't this mean Ford and GMs and others would be pressured  considering they use advertising and dealership that spends a lot. and i read Ford is quietly moving away from dealership model,btohqsg
typo sorry. i cut and past,btohqsg
I think he is in a Tesla mode today,btohqsg
Mazda has its die-hard followers. i hear of one family buying all 3 cars and all mazdas,btohqsg
Why u bother about Ford? They not even in Sg anymore,btohqsg
I don't think ford and GM will be pressured until Tesla and other manufacturers are able to make EVs that can rival their trucks such as the f150 and Silverado with the same capabilities or big sized SUVs like the escalade or explorer  etc.,btohqsg
All brands have their die hard followers,btohqsg
Tesla if cheap is not Tesla anymore,btohqsg
Who wants to buy cheap stuff??? Surely not the mighty Singaporeans,btohqsg
haha i dont think so... only rival from ford wld be the mustang machE,btohqsg
they will be pressured. time will come. shift will come,btohqsg
Honestly what’s the value of the new car salesman?,btohqsg
ford mustang will have to cut price if faced with price pressure. and if they cut  it means margin will be eroded. that is why Ford id quietly building a special division,btohqsg
i think people who love the mustang wont buy a tesla haha  world of difference,btohqsg
because this is difficult to move away form dealership model  they got to find some ways to do it. dealership association in usa is a big business. can get sued,btohqsg
Me.. l like to buy cheap stuff. . Sell me Tesla model X for $100k with coe included… I straight away buy,btohqsg
you never know.  people can change. never say never,btohqsg
yeah im pretty sure they buy it for the big old V8,btohqsg
Why Tesla don’t hv convertible? I thought amdk like convertible,btohqsg
It will diminish for mass market cars at some point for sure. But coachbuilt cars  exotic cars with major spec options and used car dealers will still be around,btohqsg
slowly but surely. pressure is mounting.,btohqsg
i really like the cybertruck style. futuristic. headsturners,btohqsg
"Here's where the ""pressure"" is going",btohqsg
Dealers are getting supply of cars  many with full lots and have the liberty of charging super high markups while people continue to buy,btohqsg
Supply shortages have created this ready stock markup bubble,btohqsg
hah i know. i walked to several dealerships in oakland in 2003. they pressured me. i went to see the beloved honda s2000. only usd30500. but hell they pressured me to buy,btohqsg
Even Tesla's own ready stock has markups,btohqsg
No. i wriggle my way out. i sensed the pressure i did not want to test drive the car.,btohqsg
good agility! so you bought an MX5?,btohqsg
i got bored. i rented a car to drive around to check out cars  as i am a car fan. then i went to see their car shows. damn lousy. no comparisons with the german show,btohqsg
"Sorry but how does this relate to the d2c and ""pressure on dealers"" (doesn't seem to exist if they're minting money with markups) conversation",btohqsg
in a different time  i went to check out toyota mrs. yeash that one we tested the car. good sporty car. because he is american  he is clever to find ways to fend off sales tactics,btohqsg
wow mrs  beautiful mid engine rwd car. perfect car for the tight touges,btohqsg
it is to illustrate tactics. like high markups etc. better not let them know you buy using cash  they never like that,btohqsg
the sales people are very intimidating in general.,btohqsg
the sales manager in oakland honda sales office is a Chinese American. super aggressive. you know like time sales kind of tactics,btohqsg
ok rain has stopped. what should i do>?,btohqsg
Then wait for rain to start again,btohqsg
