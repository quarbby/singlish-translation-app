Do I still get 4mpd if I book with hsbc revo ontrip.com?,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposes a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
7.8% is correct  in the same way that paying 7% or 11.5% income tax is correct. If you understand how one works  the way that the other works is just the flip side of the same coin üôÇ,btohqsg
Historically  has there ever been a good/easy to fulfil sign up reward for Maybank Platinum Visa from Singsaver/Moneysmart? So far what i observed is that the spend criteria and sign up rewards from these 3rd Party sites are the same as what Maybank offers if you were to sign up with them directly..,btohqsg
How to pay for SP utilities using UOB one card in order to get the cash back?1. By adding UOB card to the SP app?2. Giro via UOB bank?3. Bank transfer to Bill payee?4. Others?,btohqsg
7.8% is the cream of the cake. You just can‚Äôt walk into a bakery shop n tell the staff you want to buy the cream of the cake without cake.,btohqsg
Aiyah it is actually exaggerated advertising by banks. All of them do it.They can get away with it because they * it with disclaimers and they do explain properly if u read the disclaimers.,btohqsg
Hi gurus..may I know how does uob calculate the account balance in uob one account?,btohqsg
Any idea which issuing bank to indicate when using Amaze card for Agoda payment? Or do I indicate the issuing bank of the linked card?,btohqsg
U want to use bank card directly if your hotel eligble for bank promo. Might be cheaper,btohqsg
Same promo discount for Amaze and the bank coz the promo is for Mastercard  so thought of using Amaze to avoid DCC from Agoda  but unsure what to fill for issuing bank during payment.,btohqsg
Citibank is 20 percent ocbc is 18 percent,btohqsg
I see  amaze dont have issuing bank  nium is the one that produce the card i think,btohqsg
I see. Guess can only indicate the linked card then. Tried citibank promo  but somehow not discounted.,btohqsg
Agoda at payment page sometime have error,btohqsg
Need to rekey card number or something to apply the bank discount,btohqsg
Question:I saw someone's comment here on this chat (in January 2024 )  that they link HSBC Revo to AliPayIs that better than linking Youtrip to AliPay? Cuz if you use Revo  won't you be subjected to worse exchange rates??? Net of the cashback = still worse off than using Youtrip?Anyone able to shine some light on this?,btohqsg
Maybe they want the miles? YouTrip no rewards,btohqsg
Any idea if you can use trust credit card for overseas instalment?,btohqsg

starhub pre auth deducted 1 dollar..lol..my figures are all current balance.. shown in app,btohqsg
Cannot based on current balance  based on the transactions.. you see StarHub's deduction is really on 10 Dec or 11 Dec,btohqsg
so daily closing is based on available balance?,btohqsg
The difference is the based interest? $4.24,btohqsg
dang! they said current balance! lmao,btohqsg
Your bonus interest on excel put 420.44 what did UOB give tho?I'm assuming the excel is created by you right?,btohqsg
ya..i create and recorded all movements,btohqsg
Seems tally with your excel ma  unless your excel data for interest is not by formula?,btohqsg
Where short? Your excel states 420.44 + 4.24.. same as the bank account üòÖ,btohqsg
my excel 4.24 and 420.44 i followed wat they gave....but how i count...i counted 424for bonus interest..haha,btohqsg
based on their tiered interest on MAB 100 070.85,btohqsg
Seems correct.. if I'm UOB I even kope back 3 cents ü•¥,btohqsg
wow..ur diff 3 cents only! haha,btohqsg
Wouldn't complain getting 3 cents more if I were you,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm new here‚Ä¶ planning for a wedding this year and totally lost in this credit card miles thingyAnyone can advise what‚Äôs the best card to use now for hotel banquet? Also  if my fianc√© and I get diff cc are we able to combine our miles? üòÖThanks in advance!,btohqsg
I remember somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúWedding card‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
1. Confirm the hotel mcc first. You could ask them to let u pay $100 to test first. Generally speaking u should do well with 2 x Uob lady solitaire cards (6mpd now for $3k each per month  may drop to 4mpd after Feb)2. Cannot combine miles across 2 persons.,btohqsg
CIMB FastSaver 3.5% pa interest promo,btohqsg

Hi  if I have a DBS credit card bill due on 19 Feb for amount $10k  and I pay $5k to the card today  will the GIRO arrangement automatically take care of the remaining $5k?,btohqsg
i assume you already have GIRO set up in place yes? if yes then from now till 19 feb is enough time for system to update to only deduct remaining amount. if your GIRO is this week and you pay 5k  system might still deduct full 10k from your account resulting in overpayment of 5k,btohqsg
Hello all  does anyone have problem with OCBC app? I have been trying to link my OCBC credit card to Amaze but on the verification page  OCBC app doesn't pop up. Even when I go into the app  there is nothing.,btohqsg
Thanks. I am ok with overpayment - more concerned whether the GIRO will still go through haha,btohqsg
