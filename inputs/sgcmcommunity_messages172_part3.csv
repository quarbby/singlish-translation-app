Even if you drive speed limit,btohqsg
Road hogging is still road hogging,btohqsg
If you see cars overtake you while in you‚Äôre in lane 1,btohqsg
But road hogging mostly on lane 1. If u travel 60 on the other lanes is not hogging leh,btohqsg
This will be best if driver has common sense,btohqsg
Entire lane 1 overtake him  he still slowly drove,btohqsg
The outer (right-hand) lane is for overtaking only; do not stay in it longer than necessary after overtaking vehicles in the centre lane. --> Singapore Statues alr say 1ST LANE FOR OVERTAKING ONLY. OVERTAKE ALR GO BACK 2ND. ITS NOT THAT DIFFICULT.,btohqsg
Cause lane 1 considered ‚Äúfast lane‚Äù mah,btohqsg
Yea  i drive lane 1 to overtake people on lane 2,btohqsg
So just overtake lane 2 or 3 lor,btohqsg
But many dont think so. They believe if they travel at speed limit. They are not wrong,btohqsg
I drive lane 2 to overtake lane 1,btohqsg
They will only give way if u are ambulance or TP,btohqsg
Lol got 1 video this vezel dont give way for TP,btohqsg
So this is more about common road courtesy than traffic rules,btohqsg
TP on blinker also never move,btohqsg
Conclusion: if I am car B  I will just use Lane 2 and whacked further then use Lane 1....by then  Car A can smell my exhaust liaooo,btohqsg
Exactly but do so without TP catching,btohqsg
yeap msia they see u faster they just give way,btohqsg
not like SG  taxi uncle driving 70 on a 90 lane 1,btohqsg
Yes they practise this very well,btohqsg
After i filter the msia car show me his finger,btohqsg
Cos it is unwritten rule to them that u giveway to faster cars coming from behind,btohqsg
But very different here in sg,btohqsg
I think i will also show u finger,btohqsg
dun show finger in SG lah,btohqsg
will kena charged for road rage one,btohqsg
usually i just turn my head stare at them and drive off,btohqsg
Show thumb can or not??? Hahaha,btohqsg
All die die must be infront,btohqsg
Even if car behind u die die must squeeze in the narrow gap,btohqsg
I saw one taxi speed past me nearly strike the kerb jus to merge into my lane,btohqsg
I just dont understand why. Can save how many minutes or seconds?,btohqsg
U risk it just to save a few seconds but if you fail. U end up losing money,btohqsg
U let the car further infront of u proceed first,btohqsg
Is not cannot. Is they don‚Äôt wan to,btohqsg
Maybe cos our sg cars too expensive,btohqsg
I ever even kena horn by taxi behind for allowing a car beside to filter infront of me,btohqsg
It‚Äôs always the taxis hor I realize,btohqsg
Haha now pte hire cars also sharing the prize liao,btohqsg
All sohai hog first lane and still cannot keep to lane,btohqsg
Will anyhow in and out de,btohqsg
They wanna get ahead to the front like Hamilton,btohqsg
But sian can‚Äôt do anything. I p plate. They more senior I must let them go,btohqsg
