Imagine wkends still have to otüò™,btohqsg
üòÜ high salary best go study politics,btohqsg
I recalled that labs had to often test for poison  toxic substance from patient,btohqsg
That is if someone failed art school üíÄüíÄüíÄ,btohqsg
Then can throw ü•ö or notüòÇ,btohqsg
My friend was responding to r/sgexams on an art degree query,btohqsg
Then some dude say can consider joining politics üíÄ,btohqsg
Back to topic year lab workers have to ot during pandemic to detect virus from patients fluids,btohqsg
My ma'am in my camp during my ns came from an arts degree in nus,btohqsg
If all fails can consider army dxo,btohqsg
Back in early 1980 hiv epidemic   the lab workers have to also develop new test kit to detect virus and antibodies   not easy considering the tech back then,btohqsg
Many here was not even borne ü§ê,btohqsg
Yup i heard it was scary then,btohqsg
But at least for covid  the body is capable of removing the viruses through immune response but not for hiv ... it in fact took them many months to realise such a virus exists,btohqsg
What we hope to know is anyone has insider news abt the market trend for the next few yrs üòâ üòÄ,btohqsg
Even art work can be AI generated,btohqsg
Using gc emulator to study modulus functions at h2 Math..... if anyone need such emulator can get from play store üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
If anyone had that they would have already sold it to some hedge fund for like hundreds of millions liao,btohqsg
I use CalcES  also recommend it,btohqsg
Ahh I will see if I can find,btohqsg
Posting on behalf of@iamneiuhHi! I‚Äôm an undergraduate from Nanyang Technological University. I‚Äôm currently working on a research study titled ‚ÄúIRB-2024-787 Generative AI and Education Equity: Opportunities and Challenges.‚Äù We are looking for secondary school students aged 13 to 18 who use or have knowledge of AI tools like ChatGPT in their studies. If you are interested in participating  please indicate your interest by filling up this form! Your input would be incredibly valuable  and participation is voluntary. Should you have questions on participants' rights in the study  please contact NTU IRB (Email:IRB@ntu.edu.sg). Thank you for your help!https://forms.gle/KCeCp9g5iLudEnuB7,btohqsg
They say NTU data analytics not good?,btohqsg
your degree is the most important üëç,btohqsg
like what are you concerned about exactly,btohqsg
My friend say the curriculum not v good,btohqsg
2nd major is usually cuz ur interested in learning smt new right,btohqsg
But I‚Äôm js afraid because of that ppl say:(,btohqsg
2nd/double major typically has at least some usefulness to your major in terms of future careers,btohqsg
that's why you can't just pick any random combination,btohqsg
but ofc you can take it out of passion,btohqsg
also should clarify that in ntu specifically  double and second major are diff things,btohqsg
Idk she keep asking me to ‚Äúfind out for myself‚Äù im so lost rn,btohqsg
is it blunt for me to say,btohqsg
if that's all she's willing to tell you,btohqsg
like if someone is gonna be vague in their advice,btohqsg
then no point bothering with it,btohqsg
also as far as uni goes  do some research on the curriculum and see what mods can be taken,btohqsg
if it interests you/you find it useful,btohqsg
Ya I actually got annoyed leh,btohqsg
I keep asking she keep saying ‚Äútsk aiya nvm la‚Äù,btohqsg
like you'll always have a mix of good and bad mods just saying,btohqsg
and a so called bad mod you can make up for it by working on your own for it,btohqsg
uni isn't jc like you're not going to be spoon fed anyway,btohqsg
and there are some undergrads that claim profs that don't spoonfeed aren't good,btohqsg
CBE+ DA can do what ah,btohqsg
like the only good thing she said is find out for yourself so it's legit,btohqsg
how about you go in and draw conclusions yourself,btohqsg
I might be one of them lmao,btohqsg
Ngl I js wanted to value addBut hard to find this combo ioh leh,btohqsg
instead of relying on someone that isn't even in your faculty,btohqsg
Spoonfeed in the sense that at least there needs to be answer sheets,btohqsg
Not just upload pyp and then no answers no nothing,btohqsg
DA (and anything cs related tbh) is useful,btohqsg
My that business friend say DA is not under computing,btohqsg
Then my poly friend go agree,btohqsg
DA not under computing duly noted üëåüèº,btohqsg
Success depends on you  so don't give up and keep trying.,btohqsg
But in Chem Eng? It‚Äôs a little weird tho come to think ab it,btohqsg
anything stem will find some use for data analytics,btohqsg
you may not use it in whatever job you end up doing,btohqsg
nothing is weird when it comes to da,btohqsg
but it's useful to have under your belt,btohqsg
no offense to your friend but she's an idiot then,btohqsg
theres alot of masters courses that focus on analytics in diff sectors  aviation  healthcare  marketing  anything needs data btw,btohqsg
thanks for saying something i wanted to say but was busy laughing at the statement üòåüòå,btohqsg
Thanks manYou fr make me confident of my course again,btohqsg
Idk why I keep getting shaken,btohqsg
i'm gonna put it this way,btohqsg
data analytics is like a pre req for doing a lot of higher level cs stuff,btohqsg
a lot of stem jobs one way or another will require you to do data analytics,btohqsg
just saying  if a business person with no literal linkage is affecting your beliefs  i think you need to toughen up more to thrive in mech eng + da,btohqsg
no sugar coating from me too,btohqsg
in fact even biz side find use for it,btohqsg
"so like putting aside whether it's under computing or not or whether the curriculum is ""bad""",btohqsg
they're still skills that's good to have,btohqsg
the odds of you picking things up to the level of a second major independently are p low,btohqsg
But I fr damn scared cause she‚Äôs my senior,btohqsg
Then I think she v pro and all,btohqsg
if a secondary opinion is affecting / tainting your thoughts  youve gotta start learning to have a backbonesenior or not,btohqsg
ive challenged seniors in every aspect,btohqsg
if you have no backbone youre gonna question everything you do,btohqsg
you can drop a 2nd major ...,btohqsg
if you end up not liking it,btohqsg
shes not taking your pathway so  shes not a pro in your field. someone can be smart in business but know nothing about coding  or anything related in the field of your choiceif thats the case  their opinion kinda shouldnt bother you.,btohqsg
Thanks Sia but how to have backbone,btohqsg
Start by respecting your own thoughts and opinions,btohqsg
u cant survive coding or engineering if you cant trust / accept not everyone is gonna like or support your choices,btohqsg
obv dont make bad decisions and wonder why they dont think its a good idea but if you know its not bad  dont just give in because theyre your senior,btohqsg
"Personally  I wld say you have to ""accept the consequences""",btohqsg
I understand that sometimes you doubt yourself  and you want validation from someone else,btohqsg
Like as much as i agree with your friend  it doesnt mean that people shld not take the 2nd major,btohqsg
But you cant just keep depending on others to make a decision for you. You have to sit down  think through  read up everything and then come to a conclusion yourself,btohqsg
Your friend is providing a different view and you have your own view,btohqsg
That doesnt meant that one is wrong  both cld be correct,btohqsg
Is like eating yknow. If i need someone to tell me whether or not i can eat i would lose all my belly fats now,btohqsg
but if your friend doesn't wanna elaborate,btohqsg
There is no perfect course or plan for you,btohqsg
I dont need you to tell me,btohqsg
I need my bank account to...,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the difference between having a backbone and unreceptive and thinking you‚Äôre alw right,btohqsg
one is being assertive  the other is being a dick,btohqsg
"one is trusting and respecting your decisions whilst considering the other take (if they have one and not just ""this is dumb"" with no elaboration)the other is disregarding all opinions or reasoning and just saying youre always right even when someone is showing you that there are somethings that can / are wrong with your approach",btohqsg
Its like now  everyone can tell you all the information you need but ultimately its you who needs a change in mindset,btohqsg
Hi guys what‚Äôs the difference between NTU CCEB:- engineering sci with double major in process engineering and synthetic chemistryAnd- chemical and biomolecular engineering,btohqsg
have you looked at the relevant curriculum and mods,btohqsg
One is chem engThe other is chem eng and chemistry,btohqsg
The career prospects like ab the same also,btohqsg
Also the top one is a double major. The other is a single major,btohqsg
How‚Äôs this a double major when we study lesser,btohqsg
Oh tbh this double major is new,btohqsg
They just released it for this yr batch,btohqsg
Wait lemmi watch big bang theory in my comm tutorial,btohqsg
i wouldn‚Äôt put too much stock into that description,btohqsg
The double major course also don‚Äôt have description ab curriculum leh,btohqsg
So I‚Äôm a bit like ???,btohqsg
Being careful of who you interact with online ... btw I want to ask uh,btohqsg
Dating app thought by right should have minimum age requirement or sth ?,btohqsg
Lol ... subreddit mods have to often ban ppl who are below 13 and I remember that got one cass mentioned by youtube user gt a dude use false age numbers to access dating app,btohqsg
the dating app thing is extremely common,btohqsg
His brother used tantan app üíÄ,btohqsg
Haha think maybe next time dating app might require identification through documentation üòÖüòÖüòÖ prevent underage accessing platform.,btohqsg
China one need real name hahahaha with face verification,btohqsg
How accurate sia like false positive and false negative rates ?,btohqsg
Wld say is both chem eng. But the double major one includes chemistry.,btohqsg
Personally i feel like chem eng is more about how to build these molecules more efficiently(or in general just building) while chem is more about why these molecules can be formed,btohqsg
^quite vague and overlap but this is how I think uh,btohqsg
Nah Idw know why it is formed,btohqsg
Idt I smart enuf for th at,btohqsg
u can still study chem engi and work other sectors,btohqsg
one thing my advisor mentioned was  if your english & math is very weak (or either one)-- you're gonna struggle no matter where u study or work,btohqsg
i mean you'd be designing and handling the industrial process,btohqsg
kinda hard to do that without knowing how the process works,btohqsg
Actually Chem Eng is quite broad leh,btohqsg
I feel like I‚Äôm learning physics chem math bio,btohqsg
at a higher level they're all linked,btohqsg
it's only pre uni that they're split so distinctly,btohqsg
I mean if you want to take it as a double major  you can.,btohqsg
The difficulties you overcome are lessons for you.,btohqsg
There would usually be some reason why they would make chem eng and chem as a double major,btohqsg
Plus if you want  you can also drop the other major to make it a single major also,btohqsg
Besides it tends to be a harder to convert from a single major to a double major as compared to the opp,btohqsg
But then at the same time you also need to know your own limits uh,btohqsg
me but with eng like i got a c6 for that sigh,btohqsg
the reason is a combination of understanding the phenomena and applying it to an industrial process,btohqsg
and the chem side you'd have a broader understanding,btohqsg
bc for the sake of engineering  diff parts of chem you'd only need to know to certain depth,btohqsg
But of course it depends on what you want uh,btohqsg
If you are focused on grades  then yea  it may not be suited,btohqsg
But if you focus on like long term goals like career or industry,btohqsg
Or if not you can try to opt for a minor in chem uh  but tbh they would most likely prefer a double major or second major over a minor,btohqsg
Dont talk to me about chem omg,btohqsg
Im in a biophysics lab now and the last i actively used the word molar was probably 5 years ago,btohqsg
U in your biophysics mod mahhhh,btohqsg
Phan ahn tuan purposely send email at 12am yesterday,btohqsg
Limbei was relaxing at home alr,btohqsg
Watching big bang theory on laptop for comms for the sci mod,btohqsg
Meanwhile for soft condensed matter  9am lecture but participation can be at night,btohqsg
You reminded me i need to write some participation shit on padlet for hw tmr,btohqsg
What kind of monster wld do that,btohqsg
For us  we listen to documentaries at x1.25 speed :D,btohqsg
Bro irs supposed ro be week 2's work,btohqsg
Write about a scientific concept blablabla,btohqsg
I dont even know what nonsense to write,btohqsg
Imma write about a black hole because thats what im feeling now,btohqsg
Bruh that was our grp work,btohqsg
Like that was our wk 2 grp work done in tutorial,btohqsg
If not i wouldnt be in a lab now,btohqsg
Because i wouldve dropped this mod in a heartbeat hearing that i need to come back in hbl week,btohqsg
Lmao shld have changed to mine,btohqsg
Not even God can get me to come back hbl week,btohqsg
We end 20 mins before the actual timing,btohqsg
What are yall gonna eat for CNY,btohqsg
Apparently my care for grades did,btohqsg
What kind cuz u a snack too,btohqsg
as someone with a PC. Please learn to use the screenshot button ü•¥else you will be the most hated person in Uni. lol.,btohqsg
double major =/= double degree tho,btohqsg
I remember NTU went to my A-Level college in KL last time got intro there are 3 variants++ for their Engineering programs,btohqsg
"then got one Engineering program macam very ""terror"" one called Renaissance Engineering",btohqsg
I mean they give u a master for all the brain damage u are supposed to achieve,btohqsg
I get brain damage from talking to you too  wheres my masters,btohqsg
i got brain damage from teaching,btohqsg
I mean sure it is a scholars program.,btohqsg
But i dont see it as prestigious as like cnyang or nie teachers scholars...,btohqsg
Im pretty sure renaissance accepts less than medicine itself so that has to be a prestiguous feat?,btohqsg
I have heard of ppl complaining abt budgeting issues before,btohqsg
also in the context of engineering,btohqsg
Before u had to be a scholar to enroll,btohqsg
Now is diff la but in general for engineering REP is REP,btohqsg
^btw the website says is a double major tho.,btohqsg
yeahh. yeah. I just need to mentioned that NTU does offers Double Degrees.,btohqsg
or atleast last time in 2016 when they promoted in my College la.,btohqsg
Double degree in engineering and econs,btohqsg
yep. that's what I recalled also.,btohqsg
Just a plug.. now got Chinese Med also no need do that liao,btohqsg
Yea this one became a single major in chinese medicine now,btohqsg
Oh ps we also have ppe too :D,btohqsg
that‚Äôs not a double degree right,btohqsg
Wait wat actly got traditional chinese med?,btohqsg
it‚Äôs just 3 disciplines squeeze into 1 deg,btohqsg
Idk what is the 3rd discipline,btohqsg
I tot wld be only private degrees or smth,btohqsg
To be fair  ntu was a chinese speaking school in the past,btohqsg
The gov merge a chinese spealing sch and a eng speaking sch,btohqsg
And they really wanna make it chinese speaking,btohqsg
But even since someone asked me if ntu is a chinese school,btohqsg
I am starting to feel like it is becoming one,btohqsg
last week ss canteen was insane,btohqsg
They removed the pasta stall üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
AND CHANGED IT TO A CHINESE FRIED STALL,btohqsg
I swear they really not solving the lack of halal food issue,btohqsg
the pasta like quite ex so dont really eat,btohqsg
The one that closed down in arnd 2021,btohqsg
feedback to Uni  to get a Sharwarma Arabic stall?,btohqsg
Like I am seeing 3 or 4 China stalls now.,btohqsg
My friend was conplaining to me non stop,btohqsg
At least NTU divide the load equally,btohqsg
if the price is reasonable then sure we can have an arabic stall,btohqsg
Or at least an indian stall,btohqsg
Tbh our double major is truly cut load into 2,btohqsg
Like when we say dbl major we mean double equally,btohqsg
Whereas NUS don't mean it one,btohqsg
i mean engineering + econs is still leaning towards engineering but i guess not a big diff btwn the two,btohqsg
I think the most hardcore one wld be business and comp sci,btohqsg
For dbl degree u still are classified as CoE student what,btohqsg
Tbh i wld have loved ntu to have a science + communications degree tho,btohqsg
ehh. don't really like Indian stalls  after the horrors i seen in Malaysia's mamaks. üòÇ,btohqsg
I love butter chicken or chicken curry,btohqsg
But at ntu south spine we get the cheapo laksa kind,btohqsg
We rlly need more variety in south spine.,btohqsg
ikr ss eat till sian le,btohqsg
I have to go up and then go down,btohqsg
im thinking what‚Äôs the closest we have,btohqsg
The closest we have is iem,btohqsg
I'm not rlly a hard core fan of engineering,btohqsg
not really all circuits la‚Ä¶got software  comms  media processing,btohqsg
What's wrong with AI and Society,btohqsg
Doesnt rlly suit the comms side,btohqsg
The society side has comm mods..,btohqsg
Bruh imo IEM is less of Comms than AI and Society,btohqsg
Cuz AI and Society actually can take WKW mods,btohqsg
Nah man iem is closer than ai and society,btohqsg
The only thing stopping me from iem,btohqsg
Is the option of removing fyp,btohqsg
means you want to skip FYP?,btohqsg
Just the option of skipping fyp,btohqsg
At least when it comes closer to y3 or y4 then i get to choose whether i want to do fyp,btohqsg
For spms  we dont rlly need to do fyp  we can just replace the fyp with internship,btohqsg
well  if your advisors are kinda useless  without proper guidance  just better throw that out the window. lol,btohqsg
Is more of a choice haha,btohqsg
but NTU I doubt it lol,btohqsg
But nowadays internship also hard to find so,btohqsg
says the man that was initially thinking of doing fyp,btohqsg
Ironically was quite easy for me because of the email,btohqsg
Hey if i play my cards right you wont even see me the entire y4,btohqsg
or is either Internships or FYP not both?,btohqsg
20 wk Intern or 10 wk intern+fyp,btohqsg
Im such a beacon of light in your life,btohqsg
used to be only one or the other but now diff,btohqsg
inb4 interns at the university lol.,btohqsg
anyway interns you can take outside of the sem,btohqsg
not like it has to be credit bearing,btohqsg
some people literally juggle full time intern + full time student sem,btohqsg
Yeah thats my plan next sem actually,btohqsg
I think they change to letter grade for those entering in ay 23/24 tho,btohqsg
A non credit bearing internship + finish up whatever bde i have  then sem 2 credit bearing internship,btohqsg
i'm hoping to do intern during summer while still doing my research,btohqsg
I hope i can do an fyp on education,btohqsg
Yeah have some emails lined up to do,btohqsg
Once i stop feeling the cny holiday,btohqsg
i've a lot of things to apply for rn,btohqsg
I'm just happy i am done with intern,btohqsg
U can do FYP outside SPMS?,btohqsg
I dont think i can do ureca :(,btohqsg
I dont understand the purpose of this tho,btohqsg
Fyp or fyp-ureca its still 10au  no?,btohqsg
How many AU is SPMS FYP,btohqsg
i'm tired of supervising for ureca,btohqsg
Dunno why they dont allow newcomers for ureca,btohqsg
I dont think it stacks leh,btohqsg
U need to do URECA first,btohqsg
Then can extend to FYP URECA,btohqsg
it's just being able to continue working on the same project as ureca,btohqsg
bc one year really isn't enough to get super deep,btohqsg
Yeah essentially u get the 4AUs of Ureca,btohqsg
But isnt the 4AU of ureca already awarded for the first time you took it,btohqsg
Or is this a separate 4AU you will get,btohqsg
That's why FYP URECA is awarded based on the AUs of your school,btohqsg
like literally no diff between fyp and ureca-fyp,btohqsg
In order to do ureca for fyp,btohqsg
Oh then ya la fyp and fyp-ureca is still just 10AU,btohqsg
Is your school that awards FYP URECA,btohqsg
You need to ureca in 2nd or 3rd yr,btohqsg
but it's nice to have more time for the same field,btohqsg
Ya but to be called FYP URECA u need to have to do URECA before,btohqsg
you can fr get more done,btohqsg
like to put it into perspective  you can take the first sem just learning the stuff you need to actually do the project,btohqsg
Pls pls pls i need something education related,btohqsg
I mean physics itself is fine,btohqsg
But at the same time PLSSSS,btohqsg
But how can u do education,btohqsg
some physics profs do research in physics education,btohqsg
I cant even access the fyp project list anyways,btohqsg
So i wont know if he wld change it or not,btohqsg
Oh then in this case it's just a bog standard FYP,btohqsg
I dont even know what the profs projects are,btohqsg
you can still email to show interest like you know you don't have to do smth on the list right,btohqsg
but maybe wait till recess week ba,btohqsg
This is why u do URECA too also tbh,btohqsg
i mean that's what i did,btohqsg
tim liew didn't have anything on the list back then but i just emailed him and he gave me 3 ideas,btohqsg
I didnt even know that was possible,btohqsg
yea but like my prof for e.g. has collabs with nie so he could do like some interdisciplinary one based on that,btohqsg
But yea. I alr ended up working with nie during summer holidays,btohqsg
Thing is in this case it's would be registered as a normal FYP,btohqsg
FYP URECA got their own funding,btohqsg
The point is to do an fyp that is also educational but like not under ureca,btohqsg
Can apply for more marni compared to just normal FYP,btohqsg
we kinda alr moved on from the ureca thing lol,btohqsg
I mean also for conference too la,btohqsg
FYP works very differently across faculties,btohqsg
What if i want to work on a phy project,btohqsg
you need an spms prof as a main supervisor,btohqsg
You need a physics faculty as your main supervisor,btohqsg
But i need to get a spms faculty member as my supervisor,btohqsg
fyp is more flexible than you think,btohqsg
Idk the rules ah for spms but for soh is u need your faculty to sign off,btohqsg
Should be physics not spms i tot?,btohqsg
you could even do fyp with external organisations that way,btohqsg
Physics can go for CERN's? if you're rich enough .https://careers.cern/summer,btohqsg
Actually what's the limitations for FYP ah isit physics limited or spms limited,btohqsg
"the unofficial stance on what projects are allowed is ""must involve physics in some way""",btohqsg
But the admin sign-off required a spms or physics prof?,btohqsg
And eventually charmed his way into a job there,btohqsg
ask if he knows a phd student from bangladesh there,btohqsg
Either ways is forced 1 year rite?,btohqsg
The next time i talk to him,btohqsg
think so but man it's been too long,btohqsg
I need to start changing bedsheets,btohqsg
I mean my understanding is based on my faculties rule,btohqsg
Damn is that a business plan,btohqsg
I knew i shouldntve washed my bedsheets once a week,btohqsg
There is always demand and supply,btohqsg
I just need to find it,btohqsg
they'd pay me to stop you from selling it,btohqsg
U wash them once a week?,btohqsg
There's always a market one lah,btohqsg
How do you have the energy to do that,btohqsg
The sheets itself have some value,btohqsg
as long the job is high paying lol.,btohqsg
or just to some weird weirdo on carousell lol,btohqsg
I used to do it once every 7 weeks,btohqsg
But i have heard feedback that its disgusting af LMAO,btohqsg
Actually depends on if u use aircon,btohqsg
If u have aircon and sleep aircon weekly is excessive,btohqsg
Im standing beside teo en ming now,btohqsg
I shower in the morning :D,btohqsg
I shower and brush my teeth(unless I am late),btohqsg
But definitely shower regardless of late,btohqsg
U can brush your teeth in the shower what,btohqsg
Oh my shower is not very simple,btohqsg
If i am lazy that's what I do,btohqsg
What if you brush teeth  pass motion AND shower,btohqsg
The drain is not directly under the shower,btohqsg
So if i did that  my spit would be all over the floor,btohqsg
Calculating the physics and trajectory of the shit isit,btohqsg
You know the sad part is i always forget to put on perfume sometimes when i am rushing,btohqsg
But sometimes showering fails me cus I still sweat when going to school,btohqsg
your shower is those fixed shower heads not those flexible kinky shower heads?,btohqsg
how long do yall take to get ready,btohqsg
Erm. No. Is the flexible ones,btohqsg
I take 2 hours to wake up and go back to bed,btohqsg
Wa still got time for perfume,btohqsg
Oh you dont wanna know how much perfume i put,btohqsg
but like from getting up properly to going out,btohqsg
Just let out your natural odour,btohqsg
Tbh i thought it wld be 15 mins but it end up being 1 hour,btohqsg
i usually take like 40 mins,btohqsg
me  working routine if I return to office.Wakes up 5.30am --> Toss around in bed until 6am ->  Drag my soul-less body to hot shower --> shower + brush teeth + shave under the shower 30 min --> Change office clothes + tag 20 mins --> Go down 12 floors my condo waiting for my Office Shuttle to pick me to work at 7am üòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
The first moment i wake up,btohqsg
Or the moment I actually finally wake up,btohqsg
from when you get your ass out of bed,btohqsg
Because the first moment i wake up my first instinct is to go back to sleep,btohqsg
mine mainly is from choosing outfit + accessories lol,btohqsg
Oh that one I can answer,btohqsg
flexible one can just take down a shower head and blast at your toothpast spit lol.,btohqsg
i have a lot of accessories atp,btohqsg
Actually some of them can probably sleep in em,btohqsg
Brush teeth shower apply medicine wear clothes,btohqsg
nah i don't wear at home,btohqsg
can but i just choose not to,btohqsg
I can't see half of the accessories,btohqsg
tbf last time when idc about my outfit,btohqsg
i can be done in 10,btohqsg
I thought 20 mins is long enough,btohqsg
I always wake up half hour before all my lessons,btohqsg
I can take 2 mins if time is really of the essence,btohqsg
Except for si yan's tut i always wake up an hour before,btohqsg
on thurs i woke up late and was out of my house in <10 mins,btohqsg
brother my tutorial was at 330pm,btohqsg
He book it for afternoon isit,btohqsg
Actually TUT I like it to either be very early or very late,btohqsg
Cuz I can slot seminars before,btohqsg
This is what i call my Picasso,btohqsg

After first hour im behind playing phone already,btohqsg
No offense to dr james tan but its a me issue not him,btohqsg
Yea that was kinda why i decided to do that mod at yr 4 ibstead of yr 3...,btohqsg
And also why i picked soft condensed compared to...well that,btohqsg
Because its one of the biophysics concentration requirements,btohqsg
Until i realised they had no finals,btohqsg
And it was a lab component,btohqsg
Still in the midst btw nanotech vs biophysics conc,btohqsg
Wait why is that a bad thing,btohqsg
I took 3603 because there was no finals component,btohqsg

U don't need to either do projects or finals,btohqsg
My friend is like that too,btohqsg
Plus I dont rlly like the handsonness,btohqsg
I have alr heard of 2 ppl taking qm 3 alr,btohqsg
Yes a lot of people say money doesn't solve anything. But it's a lot better to be crying in your Bentley than on the Subway,btohqsg
Though tbh i rather take optical techniques lmao,btohqsg
it's the one that we had a full open book midterm,btohqsg
Wait is there a requirement for qm3,btohqsg
"the prof even said ""you can have as much time as needed until the postdoc has to leave""",btohqsg
After qm 2 gave ppl trauma  not much ppl want to take qm 3,btohqsg
TAs that give worked solutions go into my good books,btohqsg
Thats why im not a lawyer,btohqsg
Because both give worked solutions but both give worked solutions differently :),btohqsg

Will you still visit the relative who invites you during cny if you are required to pay part of the price they spent to prepare the reunion dinner?,btohqsg
If I am invited then no.If I come in uninvited  yes.,btohqsg
of course if you are invited,btohqsg
If I contributed something  even harder no.,btohqsg
Like bringing more food  bringing the table  etc,btohqsg
tbh depends bc if they invite me and putting in all the effort to cook and stuff,btohqsg
What will yall do if you scored badly for As to not be able to enter local unis and yet no money to go overseas?,btohqsg
Oh honestly I had thought abt it before but not very deeply,btohqsg
I wld have thought of going to sutd engineering product design,btohqsg
I would actually prefering going lasalle or going poly,btohqsg
like all are equally valid. it's just what works for you,btohqsg
Oh yea  well I mean I wld retake,btohqsg
But when I come out and still fail,btohqsg
treat it as a gap year to figure out what i wanna do more too,btohqsg
But if syllabus change ? Rp changing also to 70?,btohqsg
if you have the time and mental energy  yeah i'd suggest to retake,btohqsg
ok my take is honestly that if i fucked up badly enough,btohqsg
in the grand scheme of things a year doesnt make much a difference,btohqsg
Then will u still go to uni,btohqsg
the change in syllabus isn't going to make things much worse to retake,btohqsg
No but that is if you do ok enuf  the qn posed if you do badly,btohqsg
i mean someone that used to be in this chat is in that path now,btohqsg
fucked up a's -> ns -> worked -> poly y2 lol,btohqsg
not me being at least 3 years older than my peers,btohqsg
plans to enter uni even tho he'd be quite old,btohqsg
3 years is an entire poly route lmao,btohqsg
i dont think you should think about the what if you do badly question  but rather evaluate your options now and see which one suits you the best,btohqsg
because either way time is gonna pass,btohqsg
I have seen pple who passed ite and passed poly so well that they dont want to go uni,btohqsg
I have also seen someone who failed ite and had to change course after ns in ite,btohqsg
but that's the super minority and even then i'd still recommend going uni,btohqsg
like for the super super majority i'd advocate uni,btohqsg
why is it always 3 of us no life chatting here btw,btohqsg
because im procrastinating from my HW homework,btohqsg
technically i can finish it in 5 mins but even so im still procrastinating,btohqsg
thats how bad my self discipline is,btohqsg
My parents want me to stay here in sg,btohqsg
And im panicking bc apparently everyone has a backup plan,btohqsg
I mean you arent too late,btohqsg
But yet im not confident of studying everything over by myself,btohqsg
not possible to redo it in school?,btohqsg
you can retake a levels while doing smth else too,btohqsg
I actually have a very stupid qn,btohqsg
Im a girl so theres no ns,btohqsg
if you do h2 physics si yan can be your tutor,btohqsg
i'll tell you a stupid answer,btohqsg
no i mean you can work and stuff or even enter poly while retaking,btohqsg
i dont know how to study,btohqsg
I mean i get your worries and I wld say is pretty normal to feel this way,btohqsg
I once too was afraid I wld screw up my A levels,btohqsg
I actually dont knowüò≠üò≠üò≠ I feel like I tried studying the whole day everyday nearing As but then it‚Äôs like brain block,btohqsg
are you waiting for your results now or?,btohqsg
"My brain kinda tornadoed to a ""I will never pass A levels""",btohqsg
we can talk about this when your results are out bc rn really no point panicking over it,btohqsg
But i keep having nightmares abt my A level results,btohqsg
