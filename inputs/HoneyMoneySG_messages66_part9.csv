Hi  may I also seek your advise on UOB$ Programme? Are all UOB cards such as UOB Evol  UOB one etc able to earn UOB$ automatically when spend on participating merchants? If so  will UOB$ be earn when using Google Pay?,btohqsg
Nothing comes risk free. Should Malaysia closes its border again  those on Tourist Visa  will face a big issue again.,btohqsg
Yes  that's why for digital nomads I recommend TH instead they have proper Visa program. And locals are more welcoming of foreigners,btohqsg
Or at least they smile and say nothing  MY especially the civil servants are openly hostile to Singaporeans,btohqsg
it used to come in the next working day. but this month the behaviour is different. so wondering is it my problem or same for everyone...,btohqsg
Did they confiscated your share ? I read from the history  I thought it was suspended for few years and return to shareholders eventually is it correct?,btohqsg
same here. it used to come in the next working day. but this month the behaviour is different. so wondering is it my problem or same for everyone...,btohqsg
I didn't invest one cent. My stupid dad bought 2 properties in KL now unable to sell,btohqsg
1). What they confiscated then?2). Why cannot sell? Did the government prevent your dad from selling?,btohqsg
1) They suspended trading and people lost money. It was the same thing that happened to gamestop share recently. Where can happy happy stop trading when prices are not in your favour?2) No buyer. The bumis got special discount and won't pay higher prices. Only stupid foreigners will buy but there aren't many,btohqsg
I suspect CLOB was a derivative not actual equities being traded,btohqsg
You suspend trading means death sentence,btohqsg
The moral of the story which the writer and everyone should note is  do not invest in MY  period. If you want to caveat emptor,btohqsg
I think in the game of investing/speculation  there are always risks involved  not only in certain countries  even if in SG  there are rules to follow.In SG  there are also properties that owner cannot find buyers but no choice to sell at below market price n cut loss. There are certain properties that are out of reached by foreigners  eg. Landed properties  HDB   etc..There are SG shares you can find in SGX  especially penny shares  also cannot find enough buyers.About CLOB  my understanding from history is it was eventually released n returned back to shareholders. Quite a number of people made a lot of money from it because they bought it at the low before suspended. They were forced to hold it for long period of time.  They eventually make huge amount from it due to the suspension n become long term investors.Above is bit n pieces of info I gather past few years.,btohqsg

instarem CS mentioned it's possible to use the amaze card for NETS payments?,btohqsg
Yes  he mention will appear as a online payment with the amaze heading on the bank statement,btohqsg
there might be some confusion here  as the NETS payment terminals often also accept Visa/MC/AMEX  but if the payment type is explicitly NETS i highly doubt it'll work...,btohqsg
Yeah no NETS logo on the Amaze card too,btohqsg

"this was answering yes to ""it will be converted to online spend"" but not yes to ""amaze can do NETS payment"".inaccurate extrapolation",btohqsg
