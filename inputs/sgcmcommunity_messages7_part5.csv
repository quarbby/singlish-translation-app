The issue is not about loophole is when u add up these 10 years how much u are over paying u will feel u are dumb,btohqsg
more shift to B and luxury cars. if u can afford 200k  20k difference is less drastic than a lowest price cat A hatchback,btohqsg
I bought a car using 10 years loan with no dp   at the 9th year when I scrap my car I need to top up 34 k,btohqsg
Actually I think MAS is aware of this loophole but they are closing one eye on this as the government is still the ultimate winner when COE rise. Haha,btohqsg
Wa no one buy urus wor haha,btohqsg
And trust me this is a social problem when a lot of ppl take this scheme and default payment,btohqsg
How come need top up sia,btohqsg
0% down   full loan is Ballon scheme   so u if your car is 100 k they mark up to 130 k and loan u 130 k and the intreast chargr is base on 130 k,btohqsg
I think it could be the case of lease to own? Low DP but high interests,btohqsg
Cannot cao interests one… even one settles the settlement earlier during the 10 years loan period.,btohqsg
It’s not a social problem  it’s the problem of the borrower only,btohqsg
so example by right your car is 100k  u pay 40% down is loan 60k  and for 5 years  but if i take the full loan  the down payment is 0 but i loan 130k and loan for 10 yearsso scenario 1 i loan 60k and 5 years intreast of 1.48%scenario 2 is 130k loan for 10 years  and at 2.8% intreastscenario 2 my intreast for 10 years is at 36440 compare to 1 at $4200 intreast for 5 yearsu see the intreast  difference  that why pi will always push for full loan,btohqsg
For those who want to see,btohqsg
I last time young and stupid fall into the trap hehe,btohqsg
Can’t said la haha but is common,btohqsg
U just need to do the maths yourself and u know u are dumb haha,btohqsg
LOL... next time buy car bring accountant count for u LOL Wont get scammed,btohqsg
HAHAHAHAHAHAH the interest is really cui max,btohqsg
It a very simple thing   the more u loan and the more years u loan the higher is the intreast,btohqsg
And for such high loan the intreast rate is also easily twice more then normal,btohqsg
But for ur case is legitly alot more OMG. the intrest u paid can pay for my COE still have Kopi lui sia,btohqsg
No leh I think standard   I know a guy buy a Camry using this full loan and paying 230k for it over 10 years   and that is like 2 years ago lol,btohqsg
I wonder how much those SE earns for selling a car. LOL,btohqsg
But i tot loan is bank earn?,btohqsg
car earn little is the fianance earn a pile of gold,btohqsg
Will have referral fee 1 ma haha,btohqsg
at the end of the day how many % of people got 40k cash on hand,btohqsg
Then have to buy coe car or don’t buy car le,btohqsg
even if interest higher people will still go for it,btohqsg
Why pay so much more ? I also regret when young   the money use for holiday   investment is way bette,btohqsg
"it's common practice now. u search google for ""0 down payment car""  few minutes later your facebook ads will be full of these dealers offering $0 downpayment cars",btohqsg
dealer can finance inhouse as well. i loan u$Xat Y% interest.,btohqsg
Compare the 2 pic u know I know,btohqsg
Cause they want earn the intreast and bank won’t do full loan,btohqsg
yup. bank regulated by MAS too. have to assess your income  and can only loan 60% for OMV>20k (most cars),btohqsg
Absolutely. That’s why I said in singapore but used car.,btohqsg
It’s a cost component. Get a good reliable used car.,btohqsg
govt imposed strict downpayment requirements that would have moderated COE prices significantly  but all these in house loans supporting near zero DP car loans effectively bypassed the restrictions. So you can partially blame these trigger happy buyers for high COE prices,btohqsg
My first two cars were new. I was greenhorn. I lost 50% after 4 years.,btohqsg
True .. the inhouse one is earn Big Bucks LOL,btohqsg
which cars? certain cars can still hold value,btohqsg
Aiya.. mas can pass new laws  financial institutions can find ways to by pass it.,btohqsg
When was COE invented by who ah? Previously was No 10yrs Shit one right?,btohqsg
My plan is simple. I will buy a Tesla in malaysia. Tax free usage free. And buy a condo to park it there.,btohqsg
Abs use it there. In Malaysia there’s no limit to how long you can keep. You can keep forever.,btohqsg
Depent u buy what model and from who like e300 dealer earn u 100 k   the depreciation sure is high ma,btohqsg
early 90s i think. And if we did not have COE  we would be like jakarta now. 3 hours traffic jam will be the norm,btohqsg
AllCars can’t hold value. They’re costs,btohqsg
Make costs lower by owning used ones .,btohqsg
I mean tbh even without COE lol. Car prices are still HIGH End lor,btohqsg
