Responsible drivers are far from few nowadays,btohqsg
The green is my lane of travel. His lane of travel is the red  supposedly right turn only however when I was turning right he drove straight into me and collided into my right rear.,btohqsg
So yup.. cos my dash cam wasn’t able to capture  unsure if he will turn the story around. However he did admit liability in person saying he went straight after he was confused by the lane marking perhaps due to the downpour. Nonetheless it’s over.. just hope things get past. Not trying to implicate things.,btohqsg
Always good practice to pull out a paper and pen when taking details and just get a basic statement admitting fault,btohqsg
Protects you in the case there's any dashcam issues,btohqsg
And good in case they decide to go for direct settlement instead of insurance too,btohqsg
Ya. Too bad we were in a middle of a major cross junction & it was pouring quite heavily. Stupid me decided to rely on my dashcam..,btohqsg
Good sign to upgrade to better dashcam,btohqsg
But thanks for the tip! I guess it’s a learning experience :-),btohqsg
Wanted to get it replaced today but they couldn’t do the mobile one today as they were fully booked.,btohqsg
Always good to invest on dashcam  spare tyre hydraulic jack/sealant+air pump etc.,btohqsg
Stuff you won't really use but would regret not having when you need it the most,btohqsg
Try filing a police report. They can extract footages since cctvs are everywhere now,btohqsg
Yes. I’ve requested for footage from the shell just in front of the cross junction. Hopefully the management will grant me access to the footage. I’ll look and see if there needs to be further action taken from here since I aren’t able to get any footage. Hopefully I don’t have to resort to legal actions as it’s honestly just a small incident and we all make mistakes as humans. But thanks for all of your valuable input and advices  I truly appreciate it.,btohqsg
I had a similar experience. I was going the same way you were in green but a driver turned right into my car when she is supposed to be going straight only thinking I was going to turn right (i was not signalling). I still asked if she was ok or not and she was shaken  saying sorry and all. I wondered afterwards why my insurance claim was taking so long and my insurer told me they asked for 50:50 because she submitted a statement saying I was speeding on the other lane and I came out of nowhere. I told them I was not going to waste any more time on this and will get my lawyer involved. 100% almost immediately after.,btohqsg
There are spin doctors so statements immediately are useful  if you can get one.,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing. Yup  a lot of actors and actresses nowadays who don’t conform to their lanes properly  but when it comes to taking responsibility  all of a sudden it’s everyone’s fault.,btohqsg

hi recently saw a vintage car up for sale nearly 8 years coe but only 30+k  what is the reason behind it anyone knows,btohqsg
Was it under the classic car vehicle scheme?,btohqsg
If yes it's because they can only be driven for 45 days max in a calendar year and have a much lower or no COE to pay depending on when they were registered in Singapore originally making the paper value low so you pay only for the car in essence.,btohqsg
