There are 89 days till dec 31. You can put 19.7k and be done with it.,btohqsg
Also about this  I'm sure plenty of people are already onboard and CF's AUM might have reached $500m*.If they have reached $500m AUM  and they just decided to pull out from 4.2% guaranteed returns/$20k capital promo  they can. Which was what they have stated in t&cs from day 1.,btohqsg
If they actually just pull the plug on the promo  the first $20k also can üí∏,btohqsg
Do you mean if I have $20 000.50 of saving in CF  it will become $20 000 next day if the return is not good. My $0.50 that put into investment as a capital can be totally 100% lost?,btohqsg
Definitely the wordings in my comment can be improved. Negative here is for the daily return but total balance wont drop below 20k.,btohqsg
@MouseHunter88firstly it'snot a savings account  so you're not saving in CF.If let's say the fund somehow drops 50% in a day  you'll lose 50% of $0.50  which is -$0.25.Your total returns will be $2.30 (from 4.2% guaranteed returns)  minus $0.25  which is $2.05.,btohqsg
Oic. Which means the return of first $20k(ie. $2.30) is not guaranteed if total investment amount is more than $20k.,btohqsg
Any1 knows wats the mcc for top ups to youtrip? Does it count as online spending?,btohqsg
Topping up youtrip will not get rewards for most cards,btohqsg
So to be safe  just ensure balance always below 20k. Eg 19900,btohqsg
What happened to chocolate finance? I thought it is fixed 4.2% till end of this year?,btohqsg
First $20k**** always read the t&cs,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing.I now keep $19 997.50Then aim to withdraw the interest once it‚Äôs been credited. That way it won‚Äôt exceed $20k but still get about $2.30 daily,btohqsg
Ya I always withdraw dailyThen realised a drop that‚Äôs why,btohqsg
"Hi gurus  a noob question please. I am using crmc+amaze. I understand that both cards has a ""limit"" of 1k. With that being the case  can I say that I don't have any benefits in using the crmc card naked when shopping online please?",btohqsg
How come different accounts different negative return?,btohqsg
1 thing. Amaze follows calendar month while crmc follows statement month which may not be the same.Let's say crmc statement starts from 10th. If your amaze + crmc hit 1k in the first 10 days  now 10-30th of the month  ur amaze + crmc will be charged 1% even though your crmc cap is still available.,btohqsg
Different amounts in chocolate finance. More money more loss üòî.,btohqsg
Hi guys  I would like to seek advice regarding moomoo Cash Plus. Previously I participated the 6.8% campaign and it was just ended for me. It seems like moomoo is very particular about fresh fund. We can‚Äôt just withdraw all and deposit back as it won‚Äôt be counted as fresh fund. So  I guess I‚Äôm not eligible to join the extended campaign for existing users unless I have spare money to put in.Now I have 50k in Fullerton SGD Cash Fund @ 3.2478% and I plan to withdraw all and deposit into GXS @ 3.48% first 30k and Chocolate Finance @ 4.2% first 20k.I understand that it will take T+1 for the redeemed fund to arrive our moomoo account after we submitted the redemption request. The interest amount earned during weekends will be accumulated and credited into our account on every Tuesday.So  my question is  when will be a good time to withdraw all the fund? Will I lose all the interest accumulated on weekends if I redeem the units on Monday? Should I redeem it after they credit the interest on Tuesday? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I got $0.45 instead of $2.30 today.  I thought the first 20k is fixed at 4.2%.,btohqsg
just scroll up a little. Admin Melvyn explained ithttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/236913,btohqsg
if OP took a 12 month loan with EIR of 3.85%Use the loan proceed to put into EGA with interest rate of 4.1%Theoretically  he can make money right?,btohqsg
First  you will need 2 EGA accounts. 2nd  nothing guaranteed EGA interest rate % will stay 4.1% for the next 12 months.,btohqsg
that is too fine a margin to be worth the effort / time / admin risk.,btohqsg
yeah  the risk is if the EGA interest rate falls under 3.85% in this 12 months.which is a very high probability,btohqsg
Yes  and you lost $1.85 from the amounts above $20k.,btohqsg
Hi all  for UOB ONE new account opening  i participated in the 150k incremental funds promo. I can still withdraw the funds as and when i like and just ensure that by 31 oct end of the month i have 150k inside to be eligible for the earmark. Is this correct?,btohqsg
a bit harsh to lose so much... i am more inclined to think they messed up somehow,btohqsg
you need to follow the table. When did you register?,btohqsg
Read the tnc how they compute the balance,btohqsg
Registered on 1 oct. So i just ensure there is 150k by 29 nov? I can still utilise my funds first right?,btohqsg
"not so simple.1. How much is your September ADB?2. ""whichever is later"" means what?3. how are you transferring?",btohqsg
Im new account opening. Opened on 1 oct so idh sep ADB. I will ensure there is 150k by mid of the month and i will top up more to have 150k MAB in mid of th month as well. I will tsf from a non-UOB account to my new UOB account,btohqsg
hi  do we earn cashback via shopback for klook booking?example  if via heymax  if use any promo code within klook  it will become ineligible.. what about shopback? will be using promo code with klook though,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
1. Great 0 September ADB  so you are correct you just need to maintain $150 000 for this promo.2. So you will make it such that October ADB is at least $150 000? That is fine too.2a. Just make sure you have at least $150 000 on 29th October onwards and do not touch it. Don't do too late in case miss cutoff or 31st October holiday issue.3. make sure you do not do any transfers across UOB account. Always in from non UOB account and you should be good.,btohqsg
Anyone can advise me on this? Should I withdraw fund from moomoo Cash Plus on Monday or Tuesday? Thanks.,btohqsg
Ok got it. Thanks so much :),btohqsg
Based on past results:Fullerton SGD Liquidity fund: Monday after 1pmFullerton SGD Cash Fund: Tuesday after 12pm,btohqsg
