Does anyone have any knowledge on this?I have a trip to Japan coming Dec and since UOB exclude Amaze. Shopping with UOB KF is no longer viable.,btohqsg
How does changipay help u in any way?,btohqsg
Hihi for ocbc360  if i transfer out all $ today to another bank  will still get the bonus interest for Sep right?,btohqsg
Turns offline to online like amaze? UOB KF only reward miles on online shopping?And Changi Pay is on the Alipay network  which I can use in Japan ?,btohqsg
why u make it sound like a hack when it is very normal,btohqsg
Which merchants in Japan accept alipay pairing with non china payment method?,btohqsg
go with Maybank Mastercard 3.2mpd uncapped for big overseas shopping.,btohqsg
hahaha... i think now many people familar already,btohqsg
Not interested in having another card that I am not going to use often and have like orphan miles.,btohqsg
maybank world mastercard has:1. NO EXPIRY2. FREE TRANSFERyou sure u don't wanna have a look?,btohqsg
Lemme make it simple. It doesn't work.,btohqsg
They are rolling out for sure,btohqsg
i'm more curious if i say use ChangiPay or Ezlink... what is the FX spread charged,btohqsg
Only ChangiPay is linked to CC. Ezlink and TNG have to make payment with e-wallet which one have to top-up.,btohqsg
i think a big danger (even if accepted in Japan) is what is the MCC used.Japan many weird MCC and UOB KF CC is a very small white list of MCCs accepted,btohqsg
Yes sir  go Japan better use blacklist card in general,btohqsg
Last time I ate at somewhere near their train station using my lady's and it was coded as some public transport mcc,btohqsg
Will be only using UOB KF for shopping on branded goods  should be no issue for me.,btohqsg
I think all of us are trying our best with our own bias/knowledge to answer ur questions. Changipay seems to be new option in JP. I  mdm Mt and others lurking in JP group chat and aint aware of this.Your argumentative questions are not helpful to the discussion.,btohqsg
But dont worry Mt is reaching out to her network in JP,btohqsg
the short story is:1. someone has tested touch and go and OCBC Pay in Japan. It works  but not 100% reliable2. watch out for the actual FX rate3. MCC unknown since both tested are not credit card link4. using the above logic  your proposed changipay SHOULD work  but beware #2 and #3.,btohqsg
"But for you to question me ""how does ChangiPay help"" helps the discussion?For you to tell me that ""it doesn't work"" helps the discussion?And now going back on your words say that ""it doesnt work"" now you say you weren't aware of this payment method and is now looking into it.",btohqsg
As stated  i answered with my best knowledge at that point. You could simply answer Changipay is accepted in JP like mdm Mt shared the article. That piece of info is new to me.,btohqsg
You said it doesn't work  so I ask how do you know. You couldn't even give me an answer.,btohqsg
And you have the nerve to tell me that I'm being unhelpful.,btohqsg
One thing we need to be thankful is we have many helpful people who willing to share their knowledge. What we can do  is read as much learn as much  if we still don‚Äôt understand  we ask them. That is how we can all progress. Don‚Äôt expect people to spoonfeed to you. We tell this to our children so we should expect the same for ourselves.,btohqsg
May I ask  if anyone knows the billing quarter cycle for Maybank platinum credit card? The next quarter is it Oct  Nov & Dec?,btohqsg

Shouldn't be excluded  but just double check against the tnc.,btohqsg
Dental visit payment  eligibility for uob one cc spend,btohqsg
Oic. My answer is to Amri‚Äôs question on insurance.,btohqsg
Scratch that  linked CC payment is only available in Jewel and Changi Airport.Overseas payment will be linked to liquid pay e-wallet.,btohqsg
Will citibank closing its last branch in SG affect anything? Cards services? Call centres? Stocks?,btohqsg
Confirmed 120uni$ for a $98.67 5814 spending overseas. Not 4mpd,btohqsg
Ppv seperate base and bonus when post  in 5 dollar block i think,btohqsg
Do you mind screenshot that 120uni$ credit? Can crop other entries.,btohqsg
if separate should be 19 and 171 for $98.67  where did the 120 come from,btohqsg
abit confused. if I registered for the Sep EGA  it's only for one month (Sept only). this excludes me from the Oct EGA even if I registered for Sep but didn't put money in?,btohqsg

Changes in Amex krisflyer ascend card as well. They remove the lounges free access and up the AF,btohqsg

If option strike price met can only exercise on expiry day or any day during the option range?,btohqsg

Hi guysWhat‚Äôs the best credit card to pay for prudential insurance premiums?,btohqsg
Just to confirm  crmc with kris+ doesn‚Äôt give 4mpd  but crmc + amaze used on kris+ will award 4mpd?,btohqsg
thanks Trazora. Ah so for the one I registered for Sep   it already includes Oct  and I can only register again in Nov for this Player. For the other player 2  I register for Oct so that it plays for Oct-Dec,btohqsg
