Why not  just boost abit only..mainly i rev fr the VROOM VROOM,btohqsg
I also only use so my vtec can hear louder,btohqsg
at the end of the day it’s just aesthetics for when TP ask u pop the hood which for a vezel is highly unlikely,btohqsg
idt will boost it’ll prolly make it worst haha,btohqsg
u clean ur normal filter alr will feel more responsive no need mushroom all,btohqsg
No lah it will  but dont expect like 50% perf gain  i had abit only,btohqsg
Wah the mushroom one sucks man,btohqsg

u open pod a 1.2 vezel also like overkill haha,btohqsg
I used towmex it was fun  esp in tunnels wew,btohqsg

Not looking for voom voom kind la. Just normal day to day travel and ferrying my old aged parents around. 1.2 with turbo is good enough at least for me.,btohqsg

No Bootlip right? Easier to load stuff.. that time my car got bootlip put my mum wheelchair and stuff i wannna kill myself for not working harder,btohqsg

Good morning. See ya later at 🚗&☕,btohqsg
Stupid bots... Im here for cars not for a job!!🙈,btohqsg
I saw a Tesla on the road today  pretty cool VRN 7351A,btohqsg
Alamak .. Why you expose me? I’m trying to learn from the successful vehicle owning kor kors here and hopefully network to a job lehhhh,btohqsg

start of the show at today’s Cars and Kopi?,btohqsg
vpower racing is 99-100ish even  thought they don't specify,btohqsg
Frankly  no point having higher octane when your car can't maximise it?,btohqsg
Choosing the right petrol grade for your carhttps://www.sgcarmart.com/news/writeup.php?AID=64&APPS=1#:~:text=The%20higher%20octane%20allows%20for fuel%20economy%20and%20clean%20emission.,btohqsg
no point. just pump whatever your owner's manual says,btohqsg
Hi  is it ok to spray lubricant at the spring of the 4 wheels?,btohqsg
But you should polish your rotor,btohqsg
I heard got a lot of M3 this morning 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 even some manual ones,btohqsg
Heard got people also pushing a car around.,btohqsg
Malaysia Vpower racing is ron98 while Singapore vpower nitro is ron99,btohqsg
Baseline Ron 95 to push ron97/100 by adding petrol additives,btohqsg
Tbh just play safe and pump Petron ron100. Can't go wrong,btohqsg
Some cars have the ability to increase timing with better fuel & vice versa with poorer fuel quality.That aside. High Octane rating also reduces the amount of knock during high load like lugging.,btohqsg
There should be grease on your wheel bearing.You can go to tyre shop and ask for help,btohqsg
Oh...tyre shop can also pump grease into wheel bearing?,btohqsg
Tot it's a sealed type bearing?,btohqsg
How did you guys celebrate christmas,btohqsg
Wonder if they realised they've priced themselves pretty much out of the competition...in the early stages of the price hike they were about 10-20cts above the rest for 95 98 and vp,btohqsg
I watched like 3 episodes so far- J,btohqsg
Now their 95 is at competitive level liao🤭,btohqsg
"V power is marketing excersise. The fact that it is nothing more than just 98 with addictives which in my experience makes cars reduce timing vs normal shell 98. The higher price makes you think the normal fuels are ""cheap"" in retrospect.",btohqsg
If its so much more expensive to produce. Why can they do that V-power for price of shell 98 promo.,btohqsg
The shell station has 0nly 95 and v racing.  So no choice. Best avoid it.,btohqsg
All their shell have all 3,btohqsg
Just that some pump is 95 and v racing,btohqsg
yup pumped 97 few days ago at that shell,btohqsg

Hi all like to ask if gear box problem and don't change how long will the car last? Will the car suddenly stop and die on the road?,btohqsg
Answer to first question  the car is a time bomb. The 2nd  it's a matter of when  not if.,btohqsg
Erm  not that surprising though  a lot of car owners are pretty ignorant on cars,btohqsg
I mean I knew people were ignorant  but usually they hear the clunking and keep driving..not know the issue and ask how far...,btohqsg
The mechanic said to change the gear box cost about 2k but the car only left a year to be scrapped…any advise?,btohqsg
find another workshop and ask to get those scrapped gearboxes,btohqsg
if is common model can ownself go find scrapyard and see how much working gearboxes cost,btohqsg
Is a company car and the boss not willing to spend the cost. What should I do? Daily I'm worried about the car sudden death on the road…,btohqsg
if is company car and boss don't care why should you? if breakdown boss will bear the tow/repair/downtime,btohqsg
anyway the workshop probably quote new gearbox  ask them if is used gearbox will be cheaper or not  should be a lot cheaper maybe your boss can swallow,btohqsg
Get 2nd opinion  dun tell them what's the 1st workshop's diagnosis  and see what's their findings,btohqsg
Lol why not scrap the car,btohqsg
If boss half fak  then so be it,btohqsg
Car break down is their loss,btohqsg
Toyota allion. After start engine  the engine indicator is ON for a few minutes and while driving suddenly appear and disappear within 2 or 3 minutes.,btohqsg
If something is faulty  why wudnt u FIX IT,btohqsg
Send to workshop to scan. Could be a variety of issues,btohqsg
Walao so many veterans with so many suggestions but don't bother to read the earlier posts,btohqsg
Anyway if company car  just get quote and tell the boss finished Liao…anyway is sure Will fix one Lah,btohqsg
Toyota gearbox less than 15 years also let u drive until spoil,btohqsg
Have you seen how some people drive company car?,btohqsg
Don't even need to be company car  just look at how people treat car sharing,btohqsg
Actually if me  my boss dun give an f about the car  yet I have to bring to workshop and my work is delayed  end up I may have to OT...if my boss dun give a f  I also dun wan to give an f lol,btohqsg
U dun need the job ah?,btohqsg
Life should not be like this but well….. ….this is Life!!,btohqsg
Why do people love to hate BMW and Mercedes drivers? Are the drivers of fancy cars entitled or unfairly stereotyped? Read the commentary:https://cna.asia/3Gh2Ufc,btohqsg
Cos not everyone do their part...or the boss got a bigger prob to take care of to bother with the car...but that's what workers are for  isn't it,btohqsg
Errr I believe most luxury cars,btohqsg
They may not involve in accident they do always cause accident,btohqsg
Speedy cars can drive slowly la so that people can see your face,btohqsg
If ur boss dont give a shit like what u say,btohqsg
And its not ur property  u have no legal obligations to keep it road worthyz,btohqsg
Drive until piang then let him buy a new car,btohqsg
Cost more. Let him learn a lesson lor,btohqsg
Well just drive safely~ and wait for car to piang,btohqsg
Give them your boss contact number,btohqsg
Hopefully piang when at carpark or anywhere else that is safe,btohqsg
If it will die at traffic light then also terrible,btohqsg
Avoid highway at all costs lol,btohqsg
Sad but true  just look at the complaints on lemons in 2nd hand car market,btohqsg

Cus that stretch 3 lanes before bartley viaduct. Lane 1 goes up to viaduct. Lane 2 either go up or turn left to upper Paya Lebar  lane 3 turn left to paya lebar,btohqsg

Who’s side you on? Need retraining for drivers. Not speed cameras!,btohqsg
Wise man once said  it’s not speed that kills…It’s suddenly becoming stationary because a grab uncle don’t know how to judge speed.,btohqsg
I would say reckless driving more dangerous than speeding,btohqsg

Hey guys! Wanted to check if anyone has done any sort of PPF/ceramic or other types of paint protection to their rides and have any reviews on what they think is good?Looking to get a new car protected but not sure if PPF is worth the price,btohqsg
Do ceramic can liao. Ppf expensive,btohqsg
I think the main concern is stone chips + dings from other car doors which is unavoidable but will PPF be able to protect that?,btohqsg
If they slam hard enough it’ll ding,btohqsg
But rock chips all these still can,btohqsg
PPF can abosrb stone chips. Nothing protects from dings unless you bubble wrap the car,btohqsg
It will ding but should still be able to protect the paint right?,btohqsg
Dings and rock flying and hitting ur car is part and parcel of ownership,btohqsg
Such a long topic but…Is your car worth more than 500k? If not  just ceramic coat.,btohqsg
Mom is overprotective of the new car she picked up today and its white so she's worried hahaha,btohqsg

Then I remembered the driver was quite old alrd. So feels bad.,btohqsg
Then I just say no issue.,btohqsg
Actually if like dis  means grab insurance is bad. Can report to LTA,btohqsg
It might not be his fault leh,btohqsg
Wth  this is a point to Point Service leh  the insurance should cover,btohqsg
Yeah the collision not really his fault I think,btohqsg
