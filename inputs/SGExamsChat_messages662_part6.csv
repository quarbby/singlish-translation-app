@lxrthanyway regarding ip jae divide what i have to say is that it def exists  its just how big it is and also ask ur sis to do 2 things1. keep an open mind - sometimes you have to talk to ip ppl first. ip ppl are also human  and they may feel shy too seeing someone they dk. If they initiate conversation then its great. dont like have inferiority complex  ppl can have their own ip friends AND be friends with you2. have realistic expectations. student council pres is inevitably gonna be an ip kid because elections are glorified popularity contests but its not impossible for jae kids to get sc positions. also if ppl prefer to spend time with their ip friends its not a sin. humans like familiarity and you'd also prefer to spend time with your sec sch bestie (if you have one) as compared to friendly but unfamiliar ppl right ?,btohqsg
