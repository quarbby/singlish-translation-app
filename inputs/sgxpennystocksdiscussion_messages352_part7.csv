Australian Market Modestly Higherhttps://www.rttnews.com/story.aspx?Id=3179625The Australian stock market is modestly higher on Wednesday after early losses  with the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 just below the 6 800 level  despite the negative cues overnight from Wall Street. Gains in the technology stocks were slightly offset by weakness in materials and energy stocks amid weak commodity prices.,btohqsg
