"Hi  may I ask which is the best ""no exclusions"" cashback card in singapore to get cashback on things like membership  organisations (MCC 8699) education and things the standard cards wont get cashback for",btohqsg
It’s better than the UOB Amex right? I see some ppl recommending that too,btohqsg
Amex true cashback has much lesser exclusions than Uob Amex absolute,btohqsg

Hello sifus. I newbie to funds.Like to ask for your advise on ntuc income Asia dynamic return fund (by Fullerton):https://www.income.com.sg/kcassets/fd7f3944-82b5-483b-b7b5-fc81dfef23c7/Asia%20Dynamic%20Return%20Fund_v1_Fullerton.pdfIs this fund stable/safe?The advisor introduced me  and inform that 4% yield hmmmThanks,btohqsg

Hi In this scenario:- reached BHS in MA- reached FRS in SAThere is no way to do cash top up for tax relief.Can one still get tax relief by contributing to SRS in the above scenario?,btohqsg
Yes. Provided not 80k tax relief cap,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn  I though amaze will still deduct from Citi reward. Ok with check the T n C from singsaver,btohqsg
SRS is separate from CPF. But still limited by annual tax relief cap of $80k as stated by@jj000111.If you're new to SRS  please take some time to research before contributing.,btohqsg
Thanks for the advice!Was a little confused if SRS could still give tax relief with full FRS and full BHS.One more question: with full BHS  the “extra” funds go into SA and both MA and SA still earn the interest.When SA reaches FRS  the “extra”funds go into OA.- MA earn 4% interest- SA earn 4% interest- OA earn 2.5% interestAm I understanding it right? 🙏🏻🙏🏻,btohqsg
i think its Kevin Learns Investing,btohqsg
Sorry. Shouldn’t assume all know. Imagine someone answer in this forum while it was already answered in the other forum. It is about respecting each other time especially you are the one asking for help. I could be too particular 😶,btohqsg
Dont worry. I am seeing those spamming questions all the time  up to 3-4 different groups 😂And even worse  spammed then never replied when ppl asked for more details.,btohqsg
Some even answered in several videos lo lol,btohqsg
You can check uob internet banking. It will show up under the credit card. There is a dedicated section which shows the cashback awarded,btohqsg
Maybe not read the reply because not in thread  so not mentioned to the Op,btohqsg

When you reach FRS and BHS  contributions and interest earned from your MA will flow to your OA.Contributions and interest on your SA will remain in your SA.,btohqsg

Personally Marhaba is much better than Sats,btohqsg

Good morning gurus  can I ask if anyone has knowledge on the sharing of parents relief please? I'm not too sure if what the tax officer said is 100% correct. If the few of the siblings are sharing the relief  I was told that the child with whom my parents are staying with must be included in the relief or the amount would drop.An example would be the amount is 9k if the parent staying with child A is claiming the relief and this 9k can be shared among the rest. However  if for any reasons child A does not make a claim then child B and C could only claim 5500 instead of 9k based on the reason that the parent does not stay with them.If that is the case  could I check if anyone has experience if child A can just claim $100 tax relief while the rest claim the remaining $8900 please?,btohqsg
Just don't make multiple payments of $50 to game the system... There's dp that people got warned.,btohqsg
Yup i know i just replying to op qns,btohqsg
Correct. The child that stay with the parent MUST claim  if not will be $5.5k (non-staying) instead of $9k.The claim amounts can be agreed amongst the claimants.,btohqsg
Ya I know. I'm adding on to your reply lol,btohqsg
Thank you. Could I ask if the child can just claim $100 please? If you are aware.,btohqsg

Hi. Does anyone have any problem transferring money out of GXS bank accounts? Any problems using GXS? Pl advise. Thx.,btohqsg
It depends on the address of the parents. If they do not earn I believe is more than 8k each for this year and you have spend more than 2k on each of them then you are allowed to just add it in when the income tax comes next year. It gets more tricky for my case as my father is disabled but I am having issues getting a doctor letter.,btohqsg
Please confirm the figures above with iras website.,btohqsg

how to know? cause I checked on Heymax it says 5814,btohqsg
They do take it literally. If your parents earn less than 4k (I believe it is 8k for this year but please check with iras) from 1st Jan 2024 till 31st Dec 2024 and you fulfill the other requirements  you can claim the relief when the income tax comes next year.,btohqsg

Hi experts  just wanna check if there is a way to setup monthly giro for vc3a as self employed 😅,btohqsg
If you don't intend to fully pay off your credit card bill when it is due  going for personal loan should be cheaper. Credit cards charge like 24%pa... Pls don't use that as a loan.But it's useful to hold credit cards as banks will offer from time to time balance transfer promo which can be as low as 2.x% for up to 6 months  or usually 5+% for up to 12mths. Hopefully you have the intention to repay all outstanding amt withing these time frames and if so  you can consider balance transfer.,btohqsg
Which means there is a monthly cap limit? Or in a month I can spend 15K with the credit card?,btohqsg
Did you see the rates UOB gave when you withdraw? Yesterday evening I used Trust card  the rate was 3.2759.,btohqsg
Nope. It doesn't show on the screen. But it's the best rates compared to all the money changers in city sq.,btohqsg
It'll show on your app  how much SGD was withdrawn. Then just calculate.,btohqsg
Like the best money changer rate was 3.271 nearest to the uob bank. And uob atm gave 3.275.. I tried using other banks.,btohqsg
And it shows the amount of fees that will be charged. One of the atm  displayed a fee of 15rm,btohqsg
It means that if you are staying with the parent you want to claim relief on  it's 9k tax relief. If not staying together then it's 5.5k. As long as living together means 9k lor,btohqsg
Musthit min spend or the category will earn 0% cashback.,btohqsg
Please watch this video on How to hit minimum spend on credit cardhttps://youtu.be/OH8Vk5gR82I,btohqsg
You can try to do a top-up and see what are the options available. Most likely is PayNow only. But mandatory medisave payable can use GIRO.,btohqsg
For your case  as you are new to credit cards (so unlikely to have good credit score)  the banks may not give you the full 4 times of monthly income credit limit (assuming your annual income is above 30k). It's likely that you'll get between 2 to 2.5 times of monthly income instead  and if it's lower than the total cost of your appliances  you might need to either pay off early (so no HSBC EGA cashback) or get a second human to pay the rest (same rules above apply if the human is new to credit cards also).Do remember to pay off your credit card inFULLwhen the bill comes. If you can't do it  then you're better off splitting to smaller purchases over the year  or split the purchases with 0% instalment plans (which negates any rewards as they are typically excluded).Sign up for a card that has (1) sign up promo rewards (remember to check t&cs) and (2) able to reward you with the high spending (calculate between the choice of cards on the amount they'll reward you  e.g. unlimited vs capped).Not financial advice.,btohqsg
Thank you Melvyn. Yeah could only find PayNow option. And giro for RA. Not sure about Pay as you earn but seems to be for MA only,btohqsg
Not Financial/Lifestyle Advice:Neither. Buy a pre-owned minibar fridge  a microwave oven and an oven toaster for <$200 to get by initially.If you have the capacity to pay monthly installments for that credit card/loan  you have the capacity to save up monthly to pay in full for each appliance as you hit each saving milestone.,btohqsg
hi guys  may i ask how do yall decide which category to use for UOB lady? what's your strategy?the new quarter is coming  i'll be traveling in end jan (will be a tour so food is pretty much covered  i think it's more of retail shopping if ever. not sure what ill be buying too). i'll be utilising CRMC + Amaze  UOB lady and trust cashback. these are the only cards that are applicable (i do have UOBKF but its base 1.2mpd). also  understand that theres the FCY of 3.25%if applying new cards  it's best to not have the minimum spend as i pretty much spend less than 500 on cards each month 😅,btohqsg
I use lady card for travel cos crmc doesn’t cover for travel. Going for rewards like miles,btohqsg
To  be more precise  CRMC does not cover airline/hotel/car rental/transport/Tour agency. It covers shopping and other expenses during travel.,btohqsg
Why do you need to see on the screen when the Visa website will tell you even before you put the card into the ATM Machine?,btohqsg
You realised the numbers are different right (see OP's rates below)? There are still slight difference when you withdraw the money from the bank itself.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/256886,btohqsg
The exchange rate will be around there-about. It is more to give you a sensing of the rate Visa is giving. The other work-around is to do a balance enquiry before withdrawal (then divide by the SGD you have in the account) to derive the exchange rate.,btohqsg
I think we all know that. We are just comparing data points. I don't get what's the fuss about. OP is asking about withdrawing with Trust card as he used his UOB card to withdraw  without fees but slightly lower rate.,btohqsg
Hi besides amaze link to citi bank  what other card can earn miles from atome?,btohqsg

I am currently linking amaze to atome that triggers my Citi card. But realised that my Amaze will hit max cap 1k before it refresh. Saw mile lion say DBS WWMC can,btohqsg
Why not Atome directly? It's already online. EDIT: Seems like sometimes Atome do not get recognised by CRMC as online.Cards that rewards miles for online spend or Atome's MCC 5999.,btohqsg
Can check that means DBS wwmc can right?,btohqsg
Hi folks - new Moomoo user here. Upon fulfilment of the mechanics  would you know when the rewards would appear in the activity page? Is it instant or do i have to wait after the campaign period or after the funds holding period? Thanks in advance,btohqsg

Doesn’t looks worth the $$ to pay using this card but you can consider paying utility and cash card it also qualify under $500,btohqsg
The 0.6% bonus interest on ocbc360 can cover the fee. Plus 1.6% cashback. I also plan to use HSBC EGA to giro pay credit card bill. It's a long payment route but I think it would work,btohqsg
In ocbc infinity card TNC  utility not consider as transaction. So I think it not count into spending.,btohqsg
May I confirm with any expert here on  mcc8043 opticians is NOT under Citibank exclusion list right?,btohqsg

Very disappointed with OCBC bank. Not recommended at all.OCBC is the worst bank I’ve dealt with. They claim accounts are opened instantly on their website with SingPass  but my experience says otherwise. I opened a 360 account  and it took them over two weeks to approve it.I also applied for a CDA account for my child  and it’s been more than two weeks with no response.Today  I decided to cancel my savings account and will switch my child’s CDA account to another bank. I wouldn’t recommend OCBC. They take forever to get things done.,btohqsg
Yea but in my exp. Its the best account that suits most sgporeans spending habit esp corporate employees,btohqsg

Hi guys I've been linking my premium miles credit card to my amaze(instarem) account. Recently I realize it's been charging me 1% amaze fees for all my transactions. What's going on ah? My miles on citibank also like not reflected. I've spent more than a few thousands and yet it's only a few hundreds on citibank?,btohqsg
incur 1% amaze fee if exceed 1k for local spend or on mcc6540/4111. What u spending on  is it in exclusion list on citi premiermiles card? Why need to link Amaze to citi premiermiles card in the first place?,btohqsg
Cause people were saying that if you spend on things like flight ticket then it will be excluded on premium miles card rigjt?,btohqsg
And things like car road tax and insurance. Will be excluded on premium miles so should use amaze to pay. If not then what's the point of amaze?,btohqsg
u talking about citi rewards card or citi premiermiles card?,btohqsg
Amaze does not change the mcc  if insurance and govt services mcc are excluded then still excluded even if pair with Amaze.Main use case for Amaze is to pair with citi rewards card to convert to online spend to get 4mpd so long mcc not excluded,btohqsg

Is it better to topup cpf at start of year or end of year?,btohqsg
yes. It will be a entire new card account with 1k cap for 4mpd. Can still use citi rewards visa for another 1k cap. Note that points dun pool  so need to pay separate redemption fee if convert to miles.,btohqsg
Bonus plus interest revise from 2.8 to 2.35.,btohqsg
Depends on which account and the purpose. If you want to do VCMA for tax relief better to do at the start. This would help to maximize tax relief,btohqsg

Sorry I meant maximise tax relief in the long term. As in vcma presents opportunities to extend the number of years to top up via RSTU and continue to get the relief benefits for as long as possible. Not doing in start of the year will reduce the amount you can top up to MA since your regular contributions will fill up the gap if any.,btohqsg
That's the opposite.. VCMA reduces the amount of opportunities to top-up via RSTU. The moment you reach BHS  your interests and contributions will overflow into SA.,btohqsg
Lol OK  I'd better check with DBS,btohqsg
do u still get the 10k miles?,btohqsg
Hello! Does anyone know if I can pay for my parent's property tax through my CardUp? We live in the same address  just that the property tax got sent to my dad,btohqsg
I see your point. But if you directly do RSTU the opportunity cost is the same not opposite right? So effectively just do RSTU or VCMA should be the same with regard to tax relief. Unless the reserved amounts have any consequences?,btohqsg
No it's a different saving acct from ocbc.,btohqsg
?? Waived of cos no miles.,btohqsg
Opposite. If you RSTU first  you still have more opportunities to RSTU because your MA interest does not overflow to SA. And you still can VCMA once you hit FRS on SA.,btohqsg
i see. Is it worth to pay the $192 then to waive it? mine also got waived automatically this morning. But was wondering if paying the annual is better? im not sure about the mpd,btohqsg

Hi. For tax relief  max is 8k to medisave and max another 8k to cpf top up to yourself or family member right?,btohqsg

Got it. Clear - thank you. Would there be any downside to having more reserved amounts in SA just in case? I know shielding doesn’t exist anymore but I am wondering if there are any other gotchas to think about ?,btohqsg

If we keep doing VCMA/RSTU ($8 000/yr) and transfer OA to SA (e.g. $10 000/yr) until MA reaches BSH and SA reaches FRS one day  what will happen to our employer and employee’s CPF contributions? Can my employer still pay to my CPF account or the monies will be refunded back to my employer since it’s already full? Thanks!,btohqsg
It doesn't matter where the money comes from  as long as the contribution is using her singpass  she will get the relief if total vcma+RSTU less than $8k,btohqsg
Great! Thanks for this  meaning she logs into her CPF and I do the top up via my bank account by scanning the paynow QR generated there  she will still get the relief   am I right? 🙏🏻,btohqsg
If both BHS & FRS is reached MA will go to OASA will still go to SAOA will still go to OA,btohqsg
I recall getting $800Sorry I got $1100 in my last participation.,btohqsg
I see. Just to clarify  my employer can continue to make CPF contributions to my CPF MA  SA  and OA accounts even if both the BHS and the FRS have been reached  correct?,btohqsg
Yeap. Don’t worry. You will still get your CPF contribution 😊.Excluding the yearly salary cap of ordinary wage & additional wage though.,btohqsg

I don’t think you get any tax relief if you top up your 3 CPF accounts unless you a self employed.,btohqsg

Why not do both then if you plan to reduce by more than $8k up to $16k,btohqsg
Thanks for the info  any idea how long the fund will be locked in?,btohqsg
This is optical illusion.The truth is 6 months because u need to fund it before 31st and u should only withdraw at month end (even though lock is released on 17th).,btohqsg
First month u need to fund on 31st let’s say and that’s cutting it close.Practically for a deadline of say 31st January  a min/max approach would be to fund on 1st January itself so that u also get the max 4% pa for January itself.So it’s actually 6 months lock-in if u want to min max 4% $150k + get the cash reward.,btohqsg
technically the funds is not locked in  can put in other places that earn more than 4%,btohqsg
Uob one is actually a pseudo fixed deposit due to the interest payment structure that’s why I usually prefer HSBC EGA that’s a true “savings account” that u can touch anytime.Uob one the moment u deviate from $150k adb u will never get the 4% pa Liao.,btohqsg
Apart from tax savings for doing VCMA  are there any other benefits for doing so?,btohqsg

No more tax reliefs for MRSS as of today,btohqsg
Don't see it lasting long. It's a dying art imo. Newer generations are less interested in collecting watches  eventually will fall off.,btohqsg
1. Possible as you're self employed. But do calculate as there's a max annual contribution cap. Anything more will be returnedwithout interest. Take note that the MA contribution via VC3A do not count towards your mandatory MA contribution  and you still have the option to RSTU/VCMA for $8k more tax reliefs.2. Possible. Can potentially get back the $8k after whole year.,btohqsg
Hopefully you didn't top-up too much. No tax reliefs if you're employee and not self employed. And next time do earlier  like on 30 Dec to avoid potential unexpected server downtime.,btohqsg

Your MA portion goes to OA but your SA portion will continue in SA each month.,btohqsg
May I ask If 2024 I hit 71500 and in December government gave about 500 dollars in MA then my MA has already increased but then why did CPF deduct the interest plus the 500 dollars and transfer to SA? Cause 2025 isn’t it supposed to be new figure of 75500??,btohqsg

CPF had not updated the MA limit to $75 500. I can’t top up…,btohqsg
My medisave account amount is still at $71 500. Thought the limit  would increase to $75 500 from 1 Jan 2025?,btohqsg
Limit increase don't translate to your amount increase.,btohqsg
Oh I meant we are now able to top up another $4000 into the medisave account to enjoy tax relief,btohqsg
Not too sure what is your question.,btohqsg
Yup I believe some guys have done it but I have not tried before,btohqsg
I received this on top of the regular bonus… not sure why,btohqsg
Limit increase already. You can topup by transferring $4k from your bank account to your MA. I did it this morning.,btohqsg
how to know when the uob one CC is at its new cycle?my statement date is set to the end of every month   so 31st. I just got my cashback on 31 dec? so means decemember is my 1st cycle in the quarter? Then Jan and feb will be 2nd and 3rd cycle? Then if i want to stop using  means i should stop at the end of february ( so that i still can get the casback for Dec   Jan and Feb ),btohqsg
hi guys  would like to know more about and how they actually help me and if i should apply for one. for context: i am a 20yo poly student and i just want to make the most out of the money that i currently have. so should i apply for 1 once i am eligible for it (since most cards require me to be at least 21). and if yes  what should i be using the credit card for?,btohqsg
Am I able to top up MA to new limit today?,btohqsg
Yes I did it earlier in the afternoonHere is the link:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/tools-and-services/forms-e-applications/top-up-medisave-account,btohqsg

Anyone tested the 30 day clause for HSBC ega bonus interest?,btohqsg
"After topping up MA  the amount here is still not updated and it says ""special account"". I thought the tax relief of $8000 is for both SA and MA.",btohqsg
For those that have topped up CPF MA  do you see this being updated on your dashboard?,btohqsg
I think MA topup is not part of $8k,btohqsg
max top up for self is $8k  shared between MA and SA,btohqsg
Not sure if this is a system issue or am I missing something here?,btohqsg
Will check later but ..  it only day 1 don’t worry la. As far as the option to top up after 8k is done the SA section is showing me $0 available for top up so all are in order.,btohqsg
Just give it a while to update. As long as total amount of RSTU and VCMA is $8k  you'll be fine.,btohqsg
Thanks all. Another quick question  if I have reached the FRS  can I still top up MA for tax savings?,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know where to invest in digital gold is more convenient and trustable?,btohqsg
Why top up MA instead of SA?Are there any benefits or up to own preference.,btohqsg
Not very familiar with investing😅  is gold ETFs the same as those digital gold sold by ocbc?,btohqsg
Or is it a different thing?,btohqsg
Happy New Year all! Any good high yield savings account promo for Jan 2025?,btohqsg
Different. There are little information on the paper Gold sold by OCBC. You can read up some info from OCBC itself here:https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/articles/ten-burning-questions-about-gold.pageIMO  gold ETF/physical gold may be better than OCBC paper gold. The main reason is that they're backed physical gold.The no sales charge or no custodian fees is a common tactic to lure people to buy in  OCBC is likely to charge higher prices through the price spread.Remember  banks are for-profit organisations  there's no free lunch in life.Not financial advice. DYOR.,btohqsg
Any opinions for platform to purchase gold etf? I quite new to investing  but i have purchased physical gold bar many years ago and find it have been constantly rising  so quite inclined to try out.But the physical gold i bought is from like those jewellery store in the form of gold bar and the price was high due to their crafting fee and their shop gold price. Any platform do you know of to purchase Physical gold at a fair price?,btohqsg
For physical gold. Don't buy from jewellery store. Buy from something like bullionstar.,btohqsg
I bought solid gold bars from old uncle bullion shops. They will come with receipt and often not far from the live spot price.You can often negotiate with them if you get more pieces as they probably got it much cheaper years ago. Dont buy decorated ones. There are solid bars in 50g 100g which is quite easy to store.,btohqsg
What is old uncle bullion shops?,btohqsg
Like those old bullion shops you find in mature HDB estates run by old uncles or aunties. Not to be confused with pawn shops where you often cant get very good value for buying and selling.,btohqsg
Have not received for Dec. UOB late due to holidays?,btohqsg
Ya. Public holiday wont credit. Maybe tomorrow balance will increase and the day after entry will show up.,btohqsg
regarding uob uni$ for lady credit card  anyone have successfully appealed before?I stayed at kimpton hotel back in nov + chose travel as the reward category but did not receive the bonus  so far no issues for other hotels,btohqsg
What is the mcc? Not all hotels are under hotel mcc  some are under non travel mcc..,btohqsg
yea  issue is uob don't publish the list of mcc,btohqsg
i saw online mcc for kimpton is 3838,btohqsg
You need to chat with cso what is the mcc of that particular transaction.Is the hotel in Dubai ?,btohqsg
okies will call cso tmr  no kimpton hotel in bkk,btohqsg
It has always been first working day of following month.,btohqsg
What is the best creditcard(either miles or cashback) to topup nets flashpay card which is used for carpark parking? Seems pretty much all excluded 🤔,btohqsg
Not the additional 3.6 mpd bonus from the ladys card. I was referring to the additional bonus miles if you set aside some money in the UOB lady’s savings account. Usually it is given on 28th of the month.,btohqsg
It is in liao on 27 dec,btohqsg
Dec lady saving acc bonus will be in jan 27th. If you asked about nov bonus  yes pts were in on dec 27th.,btohqsg
But amex has 50 cents charge per transaction for top up? 🤔,btohqsg
Oh yeah I meant the one in Nov. darn time to call UOB Liao 🤣 thanks all!,btohqsg
1.5 percent cash back on 100 top up is 1.50 minus 50 cent net 1 dollar,btohqsg
May I check if I have both UOB One and EvoL  which one should I can cancel? Understood either card spending will be eligible for the one account bonus interest,btohqsg
May i check for EV charging payment (pay as you go)  is maybank plat visa  citi cashback+ and Uob evol eligible for cashback and one account spending respectively,btohqsg
I topup lots and lots of nets flashpay card using trust Cashback transport category before they neft.,btohqsg
#dpJust xferred $150k from esaver to UOB one acc successfully.,btohqsg
Mind only need to spend $2288.Why u need $3888? 😱,btohqsg
Everyone different. Based on user data.,btohqsg
Hi everyone. Is uob the only bank that recognize salary transfer via paynow? Does ocbc recognise it too?,btohqsg
Anyone uses OCBC NXT card? The Cashback I get doesn't make sense..  it used to be the eligible spending in statement x 0.5/1%  but now I am somehow getting more than expected.. anyone has similar experience?Well  I am not complaining,btohqsg
Hi all  any suggestions where I can park my CPF OA to generate at least 3% interest (risk free)?,btohqsg
Hey all  very silly question here. Wondering if any seasoned UOB Lady’s user with dinning category can confirm that it’s safe to add Lady’s card to ShopBack to pay for food & drinks stall via QR code,btohqsg
Will soon no longer be available for those 55 & above,btohqsg
Transfer to SA if before 55  RA if after 55 (for CPF Life  interest will be pooled). Both risk free  4%.,btohqsg
Sadly i didnt get it. Gotta stop spending on dbs so they will lower spend requirements.,btohqsg
"for those that signed up for the UOB save up promotion that ends in dec  did have they ""earmarked"" the money?",btohqsg
thank you!  looks like i understood wrongly,btohqsg
Where can i find this information?,btohqsg
Have anyone try to transfer from own OCBC acc to own UOB acc in large amount (e.g. 150k) recently? Will bank block / hold the transaction?Looking to transfer lump sum on 31/1 for UOB Lunar New Year Pot of Gold.,btohqsg
Shall you transfer today? Interest earned for $150k in ocbc is less than $150k in UOB One? Correct?,btohqsg
This is a good example of why I say Uob earmark promo is effectively a 6 month lock in.1. You have fears of such incidents if u only transfer in on last day2. The amount u move in on last day  even if successful  will not earn 4% pa.3. If I was participating in the Uob earmark promo which requires me to bring in the money by 31st January 2025  I would have funded by account on 2nd January 2025 with $155 000 so my adb for January 2025 is $150k.,btohqsg
make sense too...OCBC will give 4.6% (salary  save  spent) for $100k,btohqsg
"boosting it to 150k by ""borrowing"" from my spouse 😅",btohqsg
That means you will transfer $100k from ocbc to uob only.,btohqsg
Yeah  sort of. Recently MAS has regulation for bank to block transaction >25k / drain down to 50% of the account. So wonder anyone experience before.,btohqsg
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-framework-holds-financial-institutions-telcos-accountable-to-scam-victims-kicks-in-on-dec-16Means to transfer >25k  will need a few days to do so,btohqsg
So far I only encountered it for cimb transfer to own scb. Locked until phone officer call for verification.Other banks not yet but it’s implied it can take place anytime from 16 December.Thus would never recommend Just in Time Warrior behaviour.,btohqsg
Yours lowest so far 🤣 got 2k and 3k ones  harder to hit.,btohqsg
Hi all  if I cancel my AMEX card to reset ‘new to amex platinum’ status  so that 1 year later if got signup deals  can sign up again  will I get blacklisted by AMEX?,btohqsg
Plat charge? I think have to wait 24 months for charge card,btohqsg
@mttelegrammttill now HSBC EGA promo not updated. My macro haven't ping me,btohqsg
Happy new year.. anyone know if I cancel uob credit card due to reject my waiver request. Will the point stay since is pool? Or I cancel the point gone too?,btohqsg
Morning all- anyone know if I would withdraw from choco finance for more than 20k.. how long does it take to process?,btohqsg
As long as you have one UNI$ earning card remaining  the points will remain in the pool,btohqsg
Someone sleeping on the job? I can't recall there was any of such late update in the past... Tho I remembered once or twice  we should only send the sms after 10am? So hopeful the update will be out soon!,btohqsg
