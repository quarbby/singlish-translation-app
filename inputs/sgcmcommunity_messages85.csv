Honestly I receive $5 000 after investing $500 is something I never expected I didn't pay for any commission fee or withdrawal fee thanks for putting a smile on my face contact him and thank me later after receiving your profit.👇 👇 👇Telegram.me/joinchat/-A2APiWPOBo0N2U0Telegram.me/joinchat/-A2APiWPOBo0N2U0,btohqsg
I AM ON A ROLL! or is it the scammers 🤔,btohqsg
I see a lot of funny funny names in the members list too,btohqsg
Here lots of rich people got car  hence lots of bees,btohqsg
I believe our scam lead source from here,btohqsg
I looked in saw the size and I GTFO lol,btohqsg
I apply leave go also leh,btohqsg
Not paying 10 bucks for that,btohqsg
You are supposed to see the cars not the size of the expo hall 😂,btohqsg
Was thinking to go or not,btohqsg
and so many of them u can find in traffic jams 🫠,btohqsg
i think next time i just wrap and put rims can enter this kind of event,btohqsg
$10 save for nasi Padang better,btohqsg
At least you come out full,btohqsg
Good morning peeps anyone looking for affordable smart key LCD fob can come Dm me,btohqsg
I’m collating orders currently thanks 🙏,btohqsg
The ones where you need donor keys or the ones you program?,btohqsg
Do dm me for more info,btohqsg
Haha I dw spam the group 😅😅,btohqsg
Almost report Spam on you 😂😂😂,btohqsg
never mind then  dun want to repeat the question again also,btohqsg
I think most are not EV users here. Thank you for reading this anyway. Have a great weekend ahead.,btohqsg
Ask our resident EV man Mr@bbfasingapore!!,btohqsg
But I do think you need to be more specific in your question and what you’re looking for in an EV,btohqsg
Too general a question and one might just say.. Erm.. good? ☺️,btohqsg
askST: Should I get a new car or revalidate the COE on my existing one?https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/should-i-get-a-new-car-or-revalidate-the-coe-on-my-existing-onethe million dollar question on everyone’s mind!!!!!,btohqsg
ahh...ok. found out what is lcd key fob,btohqsg
Right? But maybe try not to drop too many times,btohqsg
nice as it is  i think traditional keys are better ba  in terms of security? hackers can crack almost everything now....,btohqsg
If need to scared this scared that  better don’t use them. Your phone will get hacked too.,btohqsg
Even if your car won’t be hackedIn Malaysia  they will tow your car away,btohqsg
wahhh...sua. go live your own bubble,btohqsg
That’s life. If you scared so much  it’s tough. 😂,btohqsg
u need to learn the difference between scared and concern,btohqsg
Both are just a fine line,btohqsg
another troll? Se is that you?,btohqsg
Especially Malaysia  if they want to steal your car  they tow it away. They won’t spend time trying to hack your car  open your car door and jump start etc.It’s because of things left on seats  broke the window to steal the things. That’s because of negligence.,btohqsg
City 1 pedal driving so easy and smooth   good acceleration plus no maintenance  and low Eletricity cost compare to petrol,btohqsg
After driving ev no looking back to ice,btohqsg
Go and test drive to believe,btohqsg
Charging is so easy now so many charger,btohqsg
And u charge like every 3 days,btohqsg
nah don't bother  right now gov not seriously pushing adoption  in 5 years time it will be much cheaper,btohqsg
If your estate got charger is really so convenient,btohqsg
Very cheap already for byd and tesla,btohqsg
the mscp in my hood only has 3 chargers...imagine if there are 5 or more EVs...,btohqsg
Budget this type of thing is subjective so is up to individual,btohqsg
For me ev is god sent,btohqsg
U can talk to ev driver,btohqsg
talk to you can liao  but everyone will stan their own car what,btohqsg
it's easy now cos there ain't no many EV now,btohqsg
so...when this becomes a norm  queue up,btohqsg
but i'm not against EV  just thinking of the options currently,btohqsg
To me unless u go Malaysia very often   ev is way better in sg   that my opinion la,btohqsg
To me now I drive ice car I feel that it is very inefficient  slow and troublesome,btohqsg
I’ve driven to Chiang Rai Mae Sai… what problem will we have in Malaysia?Today pagoh fast charger just open up too,btohqsg
Unless you all don’t need to pee every 2-3 hours. Maybe diesel car that can travel 1000km per thank is the best,btohqsg
Pump one time  can reach penang. Without going to toilet,btohqsg
Or Prius hybrid also another amazing car,btohqsg
At Pedas Linggi  I reach with 2% left  12mins it charged near 200km and I proceed to KL.This is provided your car can charge at higher speed.,btohqsg
Thks all... Pardon my ignorance. How long is a charge from like almost zero percent to 100 percent?,btohqsg
It depends on charger. But you don’t focus on charging once you’re driving EV.You focus on what to do during charging. Do more things while charging.,btohqsg
And it depends on car. EV do not need to be full,btohqsg
I’ve driving more than 200k KM mileage in EV for past 3.5-4 years,btohqsg
Oh I see. So it's like parking your car at the charging station and run errands when car is being charged?,btohqsg
And if you talk about battery degradation. Unless you drive as much as taxi lah. If not don’t talk about battery degradation.Above video shows 700+k KM taxi in China.,btohqsg
Usually is monkey say monkey listen.Dont ev let other ppl guinea pig first.Ev battery ez spoil  and ex.,btohqsg
Prove what? Prove of monkey or what,btohqsg
These usually happen at CNY meeting among family members,btohqsg
My Kona did had a battery recall  that’s due manufacturer issue.,btohqsg
And after change till now it’s fine,btohqsg
It’s as though normal engine car doesn’t have engine and gearbox issue?,btohqsg
The people telling others to change EV are driving EVs  I don't care for EVs because I rather have fun,btohqsg
When ICEs go extinct I have all the time to go EV,btohqsg
But before ev  90% of them also drove ice.,btohqsg
Surely there is a pro into going ev. Its just matter of when,btohqsg
Cant 100% say ev no fun althought there is lack of aural and raw pleasure,btohqsg
as long as it doesn't remind me of field camp,btohqsg
To me  70% of the time i enjoy driving ice. But 30% of the time sometimes i wished i bought an ev,btohqsg
I agree. I do like petrol but manual now,btohqsg
I dont think it would be that quiet on the inside  certainly not much quieter than regular ice on the outside,btohqsg
normal cars same as EV  i've sat in tesla,btohqsg
but you cannot replace the sound in a tuner car,btohqsg
Yes  the dream would be a petrol manual and a daily ev,btohqsg
Yes u cant. Thats why im also trying to preserve or keep my ice for as long a possible,btohqsg
buy tesla and install maxhaust maybe,btohqsg
Dual clutch petrol and manual petrol sounds best,btohqsg
But im sure thats a good reason why ev drivers ask people change ev too,btohqsg
Only thing with daily drive  I think EV is nice,btohqsg
Could be even lower if the road tax structure is changed,btohqsg
Just like many supercar owners bought EV as daily drive now.,btohqsg
Weekend they enjoy supercar. Weekday they enjoy EV.,btohqsg
But for me I don’t have deep pocket. I can only have my Kona,btohqsg
Even a kona can outgun a regular ice at the traffic light,btohqsg
I dotn even dare move off first if got ev next to me,btohqsg
🤣 can’t say the same beyond that though,btohqsg
but m3p insane la i think sub 4 to 100,btohqsg
dragy leaderboard got all these aliens now 🥲,btohqsg
I can’t win most cars off the line anyways  pathetic FWD things.,btohqsg
😂 I haven’t opened dragy in like 9 months. Need to dust that thing off,btohqsg
Even if the ice can beat the ev on paper. Ev is so consistent  ice needs a perfect launch to beat it,btohqsg
Its pointless to record ev on dragy i think. Unless testing aerodynamics or certain modes,btohqsg
they should have their own leaderboard on dragy,btohqsg
even the local leaderboard should have electric part hahahaha,btohqsg
Sorry I know I can run errands while charging... Can share how long it will take to charge from low batt to 100%,btohqsg
Unless u said a drag race 1/4 mile   in Singapore road is all about 1/8 mile that ev dominate,btohqsg
U won’t have 1/4 mile to hit more then 200 km,btohqsg
But it is irrelevant as too much power already,btohqsg
To me ev beauty is all about 1 pedal drive,btohqsg
Recently I drive an ice   having to step on the brake is just so troublesome and tiring,btohqsg
hearing EV owners wax lyrical about EVs is tiring 🙃,btohqsg
power decreases as charge level decreases,btohqsg
meh i think its a good daily,btohqsg
wld get a polestar if there wasnt a 30% premium,btohqsg
the first word of your  statement is my sentiment,btohqsg
For the Singaporean context a small city ev is good to daily drive but don't claim you're saving the planet,btohqsg
lol if u use any type of transportation  its not environmentally friendly,btohqsg
This is like less then 1%,btohqsg
My car so far never go below 3%,btohqsg
when you launch continously 100 times  it has been proven to lose power,btohqsg
I launch a lot never lose powerr,btohqsg
i'm gonna  go  take a nap wake me up when the EV talk is over,btohqsg
or wake me up to tell me i've been selected for the CG/SGCM event,btohqsg
#SAVEYOURTEARSfor the EV users when they realize emissions on battery production and disposal and where their electricity comes from,btohqsg
I buy ev not to save the planet   is see the goverment rebate and no dealer margin so go and test drive,btohqsg
No good  later vegans come and scream that you're eating food sourced unethically,btohqsg
Because of the heat  many Tesla owners have said it's hard to sustain on track for more than 2-3 laps,btohqsg
I daily drive daily launch no issue,btohqsg
Does sg heat affect battery life of a Tesla,btohqsg
Like the 1 pedal driving   some love it some hate it,btohqsg
Usually is cold that will affect   heat is like u go track,btohqsg
Overtaking those car when I signal they accelerate,btohqsg
mr dave u launch 3 seconds i call tp liao,btohqsg
If you're driving in a very spirited way,btohqsg
Can overheat and result in drain,btohqsg
But other than that SG temperature is a good range for them,btohqsg
How long does it take to fully charge and can elaborate on the 1 pedal driving? I haven't sat in one/drive an EV...,btohqsg
Right if you keep doing pulls,btohqsg
Which a lot of Tesla drivers and blue SG drivers do sadly,btohqsg
If you want to brake you press the pedal again,btohqsg
Will detect you want to brake,btohqsg
Enough to over take lioa 1 second can be 8 car length,btohqsg
02.5 second is 4 car length,btohqsg
Means u don’t need to use the brake   once u release the acceleration pressure the car will brake gradually Depent on your pressure   if you totallyRelease the acceleration  the car will brake like you step on the brake . So basically the acceleration and braking should be very smooth   if you use 1 pedal driving,btohqsg
Brake is only use when you need emergency braking or agressive driving,btohqsg
That is call exhibition of speed that Singapore don’t have   but I keep within speed limit as enoigh to over take liao   floor from complete stop half a second is like 50 km already and u can change the lane easily,btohqsg
hahaha... I seriously thought that there isn't any brake pedal! so we are talking abt regen braking. this is interesting,btohqsg
There is a brake pedal as required based on regulations,btohqsg
But regen is what Mr Cai Peng was referring to,btohqsg
Can turn it off or reduce the level as well,btohqsg
Wow because driving with two pedals is super confusing,btohqsg
They stationary in the car for awhile trying to read the manual,btohqsg
I only see Teslas so far. what are other brands now? I must say the Tesla looksv.cooltoo,btohqsg
this is getting very interesting for me! looking forward to the expiry of COE and converting to EV then 🙂🙂,btohqsg

what about the usual 10k servicing? I heard that there is minimal serving needed for EVs...,btohqsg
Just need to change out some fluids (wiper fluid etc.)  Brake pads and tyres,btohqsg
Wow! I think I am the Kia and Hyundai and perhaps Tesla driver... others way out of my league.... LOLOLOL,btohqsg
Need to monitor battery condition and change battery pack if it dies in 8 to 10 years,btohqsg
You'd be surprised how cheap they are,btohqsg
The Tesla is on the expensive end of the spectrum,btohqsg
I wonder how much this is gonna cost,btohqsg
Battery pack for a hybrid Toyota Noah is 11-14k,btohqsg
Agreed. The newer cars like pointless to make beyond say 700bhp,btohqsg
There is a setting on the tesla right? To set the degree of the degenerative braking,btohqsg
So basically EV’s are like 10 year cars,btohqsg
LOL funny right  most supercars make 700hp,btohqsg
porsche w their 400hp can beat many of them,btohqsg
Yes but within same range  the power is consistent,btohqsg
U alr paid 25% for volvo. Whats another 5% more lol,btohqsg
I PAY 32% hor without discount,btohqsg
I think it's full  mid and off,btohqsg
siao then i pay another 30% ah,btohqsg
thks for this! wah not cheap leh...,btohqsg
Nothing cheap in the current climate,btohqsg
So actually change polestar is saving money for you. Hahahaha.,btohqsg
no la polestar all aspects nicer than my xc40,btohqsg
but they still give 2 yrs factory warranty,btohqsg
A friend got one at 330,btohqsg
i know of someone got offered 300k,btohqsg
COE would've been low I guess,btohqsg
no but the 230k for veloce v good,btohqsg
Do we know the same person?,btohqsg
A lot are pointless power above 200 km then got use,btohqsg
Like tesla plaid is 1000 horse power,btohqsg
U will use it above 100 km Meh,btohqsg
A sedan now 1000 horse power what is the point of super car,btohqsg
dont know ask the turbo S,btohqsg
Taycan turbo s also is a sedan,btohqsg
The challenge is for Ferrari and such to do a 2 door that is better then turbo s and plaid,btohqsg
for many years  ferrari has lost out on being the fastest,btohqsg
"its been years since they have been competitive in the ""fastest"" road legal car",btohqsg
they focus more on driver engagment and luxury,btohqsg
The racing side i believe are doing relative well in their GT spec cars,btohqsg
so is the F1 side *i hope*,btohqsg
but in terms of road legal cars  i dont think ferrari focuses on bringing out the fastest,btohqsg
Driver engagement   nowadays with ev battery placement determine the weight distribution well,btohqsg
2 door car advantage of weight distribution is no longer relative,btohqsg
but weight difference will forever be an advantage wont it,btohqsg
Taycan look and perform like a super car with top end performance and luxury and comfort,btohqsg
Not easy to beat and it a sedan,btohqsg
taycan cant even compete with a base 911 or a F8,btohqsg
the car is just way heavier,btohqsg
for the taycan compared to the 911,btohqsg
Is it I thought the track timing is king now,btohqsg
weight distribution can be better but it is still extra weight haha,btohqsg
we talking abt driver engagement no?,btohqsg
I hungry time to go buy cai Peng,btohqsg
He meant the 911 turbo s,btohqsg
Where 1   come Killeny find me eat big big bigBig big prawn,btohqsg
Newton Old Ming Kee... in yishun,btohqsg
Hi! Would like to ask experienced car owners here. I’m buying my first car. I’m in a dilemma.1. Toyota Vios 1.5A E  45k mileage2. Toyota Corolla Altis 1.6A  110k mileageConsidering all else the same. Eg. Price  years of COE left  depreciation. Both are manufactured in 2010.Which would you choose (1 or 2) and why?Many thanks! 😀,btohqsg
I would go with the vios because of the lower mileage but before making a decision I would put them through a PPI and make sure there's no hidden wear and tear or issues to be fixed and the mileage isn't tampered with,btohqsg
Appreciate your response Arnav!May I know what’s a PPI?Looking forward to more opinions as well.,btohqsg
Basically it’s like a medical check up,btohqsg
Would AA be the best place to go?,btohqsg
We can’t give you an exact shop,btohqsg
Thanks for sharing your thoughts.Looking forward to hearing more opinions on the 2 choices,btohqsg
Hahaha I’m just sharing deals that I found for all drivers out here,btohqsg
Maybe the 45 k mileage is fake,btohqsg
Nope  AA doesn't do thorough inspections,btohqsg
Would an inspection be able to pick up on whether the mileage number is fake?,btohqsg
Vicom and sta are good base inspections,btohqsg
In case you want an in depth inspection go to a workshop that deals with a lot of Toyotas and Hondas,btohqsg
I see. Do you happen to have a workshop recommendation?,btohqsg
Honda specialist should be able to give Toyotas a go,btohqsg
There’s alot actually and depending on your budget,btohqsg
Here's some suggested by sgcm team,btohqsg
If the dealer is not very keen on the inspection  walk away from the deal,btohqsg
Or they only wanna go to their preferred workshop,btohqsg
Usually those dealers aren't the best to deal with if there are any issues with the car after purchase as well,btohqsg
If they say only vicom or sta  that's still ok,btohqsg
Just that these two centers probably can't check for Odo tampering,btohqsg
Idw other shop touch my car,btohqsg
What if drop from the lift,btohqsg

I wouldn't recommend an EV for your first car,btohqsg
Still not there yet for EVs to be great for everyone,btohqsg
And if you get an extremely old EV there can be issues with the battery pack,btohqsg
Actually idea also   you won’t know that is petrol kiosk   what is servicing .,btohqsg
You will know very well all the charging points tho  probably spend an hour there when everyone is carrying on with their day 🤣,btohqsg
Nice to have a car to go grocery shopping with,btohqsg
Dreams will come true if you work hard enough!!,btohqsg
I love going around the freezers and snack aisles and buying new food items to try!,btohqsg
And risking food poisoning buying their sushi 🥰,btohqsg
Had a refreshing nap while the chat tired itself out talking about EVs,btohqsg
Let's carry on talking about real cars,btohqsg
Anyone took photos of the IAM event?,btohqsg
As with many owners globally… to FLEX!!!!! Wahahahhah,btohqsg
Maybe one day I can afford fd2r!!!,btohqsg
I think you just left an incomplete sentence sir ..,btohqsg
To give family man performance car,btohqsg
but got nice car like those meh,btohqsg
I somehow think is like this   plaid 1000 horse   Taycan turbo s 700 horse all are family man sedan !,btohqsg
Can bring me go one day sir?,btohqsg
I apply leave with my boss,btohqsg
Actually I think plaid is around 400 plus k when land in sg,btohqsg
He don’t like car one. Only like count money,btohqsg
I pay him the loss when you take leave,btohqsg
What is money when you own a Plaid,btohqsg
Can I take leave  and you pay ME?,btohqsg
400 plus k car is like a 740 ma,btohqsg
But 740 and s400 road tax so little in comparison,btohqsg
Roadtax every year fork out money somemore,btohqsg
And quality of interior probably better,btohqsg
In terms of materials and comfort,btohqsg
I see omv is 150 k ba,btohqsg
Yes but Braun’s road tax5000-6000ma half of it only,btohqsg
Huat huat here need pay almost 4x the price,btohqsg
People in the north American and middle eastern markets still waiting for theirs after 12 to 16 months also,btohqsg
Taycan turbo s can get within 6 months max if order today,btohqsg
Might be a second slower off the line but better driving experience for sure,btohqsg
Anyway driving experience isn’t only about brochure numbers or who reach what speed first imho,btohqsg
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZrulBBu37o(I thought this is cool! Think I the wait till 2025 will be worth it.),btohqsg
Whatever makes one happy y’all!! your ride your vibe. Just enjoy your car whatever you have. Owning ANY car in Singapore is already an achievement!,btohqsg
Singapore Taycan need 18 month wait,btohqsg
Seems that dealer don’t want to sel,btohqsg
6 months only from what I heard and enquired,btohqsg
Unless you indent a few things  then 8 to 10 because of wire harness issues,btohqsg
Is it I got a friend just bought 18 month wait,btohqsg
Actually is slower by a lot easily 4 car length but does not matter,btohqsg
But for me tesla servicing and price is just too good   let said model s came sg at 400 k that is suppose so   so much cheaper then Taycan,btohqsg
I had contacted tesla to change aircon filter   only $74 and they come down to my place and do the job,btohqsg
In terms of numbers 1 second off for 0-100 but obviously the Tesla hot 1000hp also,btohqsg
So it'll pull a bit more in the mid range as well,btohqsg
Does not matter really both Taycan and plaid are overpower,btohqsg
But taycan got 2 speed gearbox,btohqsg
So it helps a bit to cope in the mid and top end,btohqsg
But then again they're heavy too,btohqsg
Ya even mine I feel too powerful,btohqsg
When I over take ppl u can see they sometime will pull Thier car back to Thier lane,btohqsg
Depends on weather and food that day,btohqsg
Actually is quite dangerous to overtake motor,btohqsg
No sound then they think they are fast,btohqsg
Can see most of the time they are shock when they are been overtake,btohqsg
Have to be considerate to other road users,btohqsg
Anyone went to Singapore Expo Modified car show? Hall 6A,btohqsg
at KL maybe i will go,btohqsg
all these cars you go those usual hangout places can see for free,btohqsg

Hi all! Any recommendations on which insurer to get for car insurance and what to look out for?,btohqsg
Err…cheapest one possible? Most of them are alright. Not sure if there’s one to avoid (perhaps someone else can weigh in). But make sure the coverage is what you need  whether it’s only 3rd party damage or comprehensive and the other thing to consider is if the coverage is for own workshop or appointed workshops only. The latter is purely preference.,btohqsg
I don’t understand what you guys are talking about,btohqsg
My mummy say do wrong thing just say sorry and give hug.,btohqsg
She warn me not to trust boys like this,btohqsg
