This looks suspicious. Imma watching with eagle eyes 👀 - J,btohqsg
Is it legal to ask stupid questions,btohqsg
If you insinuate maybe not but if you’re trying hard enough probably yeah,btohqsg
Like nothing wrong with a white bike with blue accents hurdling down  gives me a heart attack but nothing says you can’t. But nothing says you can either,btohqsg
Eh don't so mean sir! - J,btohqsg
Why would you want to do this anyway?,btohqsg
Maybe he legitimately wants to know. I personally wouldn't do it. Attract unnecessary attention - J,btohqsg
Not like in Indonesia  slap on strobe lights and a siren  traffic hack.,btohqsg
What’s that phrase?“Poke poke can liao”,btohqsg
I just saw a car block an ambo yesterday,btohqsg
Resulted in a very angry ambo and a fender bender,btohqsg
Should be an offence. Is it? - J,btohqsg
But I think the ripped bumper is enough of a penalty 😂,btohqsg
If ambo hits a car whilst in an emergency  who’s liable? 🤔,btohqsg
Also  why do ambos very rarely lane split in Singapore?,btohqsg
damn. lquid accounts shoud be separate from FTX. i hear many sinkies lose money in ftx,btohqsg
SCDF will open file against the driver,btohqsg
See if he really at fault,btohqsg
there are people who ride the same model of bike as TP bikes  color scheme almost exactly the same  and they wear white shirts with  epaulets,btohqsg
is it legal? sure  they're  free to do it,btohqsg
but there's definitely a limit to how similar your vehicle can look like a police vehicle,btohqsg
As long no police logo/word or whatever,btohqsg
And must convince you don’t have any other intention,btohqsg
Please I ptsd enough when I see a white bike. Please don’t do this to me. I’ve got a weak heart🤣🤣😂🥹,btohqsg

Who knows  probably that chap might be an ex TP officer who missed his ride and post mortem syndrome from his immediate previous job as TP  King of the Road?,btohqsg
Actual cost of battery and labour cost: $5Knowing what's the correct battery  how to open the remote  having the battery in stock: $25Not knowing how the service industry works and calling others kum gong: worthless,btohqsg
it's amazing how lazy people can be,btohqsg
if we were talking about changing stuff like new mounts or other mechanical parts  i would completely understand if the customer doesnt know what parts they need.But its batteries… batteries that can be bought from supermarket or mama shop… and it can be changed so easily,btohqsg
Furthermore  those who zhng cars should know workshops always charge a premium. Its always cheaper to source for parts yourself. If there is a cheaper way to do things you wont do it?Im quite sure the fact that Mr Pete Aka Xan Aka Tio can chat on telegram  he has access to Google and Youtube which teaches how to change batteries for Key fobs.,btohqsg
Unless… he really kum gong lor😂😂😂,btohqsg
I agree  it's not that difficult to do some research or even just look at your remote and try to figure out how to open it up to access the battery compartment. Personally I have always changed the battery by myself. But not everyone is the same. Some people don't care and have money to burn. Others feel that their time is worth more doing other things than learning how to change the batteries by themselves. They let the workshop earn  the workshop happy  they also happy. What right do you have to call them kum gong?,btohqsg
my brother in christ  you have no idea who you are defending sir,btohqsg
you are defending a clown who claims to pump 95 in his 80L tank,btohqsg
@FireflyHMdont mean to be rude but he is an actual retard,btohqsg
Indeed I don't  and who are you to assume my faith?,btohqsg
we understand where u coming from but anyway it was kinda of an inside joke  in case u are new or not active here. Cos the pete guy was a degrading soab and claiming this and that so some of us just tease him for the fun of it. no offense intended to anyone else except to him,btohqsg
This channel must be very salty all the time then,btohqsg
Most of us OG members have PTSD - Pete Traumatic Stress Disorder - J,btohqsg

Idk  feels like I'm in r/SG but the trolls now happen in real time,btohqsg
