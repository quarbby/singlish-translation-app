Power become not relevant as all are too powerful and our speed limit is 70-90 that even my pmd can hit,btohqsg
i think won't lah. it's good for marketing but most won't pay for that coz not needed i am guessing,btohqsg
No no to me is the draw of power   like the coe grand t that is 350 horse or 400,btohqsg
Last time before ev u think it a poweful car,btohqsg
Now with ev they are just like cat a car,btohqsg
The way u look at power from cars is different,btohqsg
Like a Kia stinger   last time I will wah so powerful so fast   now is like why the car so loud but so slow,btohqsg
recently someone told me about some VERY fast Volvos,btohqsg
maybe our inhouse VS Angel can share,btohqsg
fast is really subjective  and depent on the driver mentality,btohqsg
but to me honda fit ftw!,btohqsg
fast or slow is too subjective,btohqsg
for me at least  sound fast can liao. scared with all the sgrv and tp cams around. later I lose my work permit.,btohqsg
fast acceleration within speed limit in other country is call exhibition of speed,btohqsg
nothing to exhibit when our speed limit is so low. I think you sneeze at your accelerator you already exceed speed limit liao,btohqsg
the cam capture nothing as 1 sec the car over take him already,btohqsg
