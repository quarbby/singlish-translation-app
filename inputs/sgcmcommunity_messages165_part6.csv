But older car engines e.g. 10yrs or more liao dun use too low e.g. 0w16 cos engine oil would tend to seep through  one ws boss told me. So a 2014 altis not advisable to use 0w16,btohqsg
My ws guy said sometimes 40 and then 30,btohqsg
Lol no ba  no harm mixing but stick to 0w30 or 20 not too low,btohqsg
Those 0w40 and up tend to for heavy vehicles,btohqsg
Cos his junior already topped in with 40,btohqsg
Hah if you make noise  they'll be in trouble ma  so he tell you OK one lo,btohqsg
6mths later change and remember to stick to 30,btohqsg
I use 0w16 cos hybrid engine,btohqsg
Ya‚Ä¶when I see how he talked to his junior  I know already,btohqsg
So he came up something like sometimes this  sometimes that,btohqsg
Once ok la our engines not tofu üòÇ,btohqsg
No point playing around with it‚Ä¶ unless there is something you‚Äôre after.,btohqsg
Dig out the hyundai avante manual to read ü§≠‚ò∫Ô∏èü§≠,btohqsg

Mazda 3 I believe they are one of the cheapest among the Nippon cars. Got mitsubishi attrage la  but I personally think is too small,btohqsg
I see FB put their new Demo unit price at 143 888,btohqsg
Mazda 3 is ok. No frills. Can go for it.,btohqsg
no frills but the interior feels premium compared to the other cars in the same category,btohqsg
Yup. Too bad. The Mazda 3 is associated w PHV,btohqsg
The new M Hybrid feels very premium,btohqsg
Lexus gg to be ur new premium taxi,btohqsg
Alot of the entry level sedan now people think PHV haha. Corolla  Elantra  Mazda 3 all PHV favourite. For crossover SUV the king is vezel then occasionally will see nissan qashqai,btohqsg
But got good think also la  for all those PHV favourite models  the parts are quite common and almost all workshop can repair if have any issue,btohqsg
Oh ya  Prius and chr also.,btohqsg
Cos its easy to get parts frm stockist,btohqsg
Basically as long as jap or kor cars  the parts r easy,btohqsg
Hyundai n Kia share same parts,btohqsg
Actually Korean car not bad also  but resale value is lower than Japanese car. Especially if compared to Toyota or honda. Sometimes even lower than Mazda cause dealer always say they very hard sell 2nd hand Korean car,btohqsg
My friend COE car for his Hyundai Elantra kena chop alot when he sell away.,btohqsg
If you don't care about others perception then it doesn't matter,btohqsg
But unfortunately it's all about face when buying car sets you back 100k before you even buy the car,btohqsg
Now K cars more lux thn J cars,btohqsg
K cars dare to slap luxury all over,btohqsg
J cars still plastic unless its camry n abv,btohqsg
When u conpare the new Avante and the new Altis,btohqsg
