For those with NRIC registered to PayNow,btohqsg
Not true. 800 is min spend for 365 credit card. so dont be mistaken,btohqsg

I haved watched the video  I am new to reduce income tax thingy. I am a PR so I only have individual $1000 tax reduction. If my aim is to save money to buy hdb in 3-5 years time  should I put my cash in CPF or SRS account better? Thank you.,btohqsg
Yes  this is the way for churning.As long as hotel/restaurant MCC is not excluded.E.g. Hotel is not eligible for most citi Cards,btohqsg
Depends on whether you believe in CPF.But usually just keep your relief to make income at 40k level is good enough,btohqsg
As I know if I put in SRS  if I want to withdraw later they will have 5% charge  if I put in CPF  can I choose to put it into OA account and am I able to withdraw it later like 3-5 years later? Thanks.,btohqsg
Simple answer is no. Long answer is both are not meant to take out in 3-5 years,btohqsg
3-5 years just take SSB at 3%++,btohqsg
Ok  thank you very much Chris.,btohqsg
My colleague just tried that. By 3rd card got rejected as too many applications at once for a credit facilityAffects your credit score too,btohqsg
Bill payments refer to like AXS  ipaymy  Cardup this kind. Restaurant are under Dining. Hotel is under Travel,btohqsg
Thanks for the info  sensei! üôè,btohqsg
Ah that's good to know. How would it affect credit score? I understand need to ensure I'm not late when cc bill is due. But would applying for multiple cc negatively affect credit score?,btohqsg
Oh just found an article on money smart about applying multiple cc at once. You've got a point,btohqsg
Can share the article? üòÇI‚Äôm getting a new road bike next year  so I wanna max out the bargain also. Lol,btohqsg

I no salary yet leh haha,btohqsg
Next year working alr then apply,btohqsg
Oh the account doesn't need the card to hit 800 to get interest?  OK but I not gona use the card so....how to maximise  360?,btohqsg
360 account needs you to spend 500 on eligible spending.,btohqsg
With that  salary credit and increase in 500 each month  you earn 4.65,btohqsg
Hi is there any 3 months fixed deposit?,btohqsg
The categories are quite restrictive I feel,btohqsg
For me  i want to save. So credit card spending i may or may not hit it. But salary and 500 increase interest i can hit. So i am ok with the 4.05% interest earn,btohqsg
perhaps u wanna look at it from a perspective that those items are already items which u need to spend,btohqsg
Thenadter spend 500 in 365. U stop?,btohqsg
No right.  U have to hit 800 right? Haha,btohqsg
So i did not apply 365. Knowing that i most likely wont hit,btohqsg
i think gotta know your spending patterns before deciding which 1 is more optimal for your use case,btohqsg
SGD Fixed Deposit Account | Highest Rates in SG | CIMB SGhttps://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/banking-with-us/accounts/fixed-deposit/cimb-sgd-fixed-deposit-account.html,btohqsg
Do you all think this is worth it?,btohqsg
I am torn between Revolut and this new campaign from UOB,btohqsg
The 3% will probably not be able to cover the DCC and lousy exchange rate that the banks will use.,btohqsg
Example? Difficult for singles to hit 500 a month. Expenses on groceries and hawker food most of time. Town council  electric bill Telco excluded how to hit 500 a month?,btohqsg

I suggest looking at one's expenses for past few mths or a yr  to get a gauge of your routine or regular expenses.. type of expenses amt  etc...Don't overspend just to hit min. spending...,btohqsg
Find a card that suits your lifestyle  not live a lifestyle to meet the CC min spend....,btohqsg
Does anyone know that when we use Shopback  FavePay or LiquidPay  is it considered online or contactless?,btohqsg
Anybody knows if amaze publishes their live exchange rate? Like how youtrip refers to master card spot rate,btohqsg
Anyone know if Liquid pay will count as online for dbs live fresh?,btohqsg
Thanks. But will they take the MCC from the vendor  or have their own MCCs? Interested in pairing this with BOC Family. I can cover the online portion with iPayMy .... but thinking if these apps can cover the Dining category with 10% cashback.,btohqsg
Based on my tests with my SC Jumpstart card looks like they will take MCC from vendor,btohqsg
Then that makes BOC Family a very attractive card. Can clock Mortgage via iPayMy at effective rate of 1.21%  and most food expenses at 10%.,btohqsg
with the UOB one  isit better to move salary allocation in?Not sure if to open given the better interest rates (and given debit card is eligible too as spending) as I have opened a OCBC 360 account lately. Will this affect my credit score or anything ?,btohqsg
Open a new SRS Account via digibank and;Top upContribute minimum S$10 000 via digibankGet $50,btohqsg
Credit score has nothing to do with CASA accounts,btohqsg
ah ok  just wanted to be sure  thanks Chris!,btohqsg
my HR maybe will get mad if frequently ask change salary credit account lol. maybe next month DBS will promote 6% ? hahaha,btohqsg
Hahah ya especially HR some is old geezerr auntie will get pissed and later key your acc numbers wrong then u ggg,btohqsg
Request change of acc more then they will have incentive to automate the process üòê,btohqsg
Haha they will black list u in their KOS hahaha üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Last time is manually submit payroll account change form to HR.Now use system  loaded UOB One  OCBC 360  DBS Multiplier all inside. Pick and change before payroll cutoff,btohqsg
It would be great if we can use FAST & use description as SALARY,btohqsg
Ahaha then anyone can cheat hack,btohqsg
RIGHT? omg i cannot credit my salary bc my company use FAST üò≠,btohqsg

For citibank pay all service  I read that it charges service fees. But did not find how are the rewards being calculated  if any  for using payall to pay for bills. Anyone knows?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  is there minimum spend for Citi Cashback +?,btohqsg
Not sure if this is referring to the 1.6 percent card.. if yes then no min spend,btohqsg
Citi Cashback+ is 1.6% cashback with no min spend,btohqsg
What's the best way to pay for car loan?,btohqsg
Ur car loan is under which bank/company?,btohqsg
Hi  just want to clarify so Telco not included in the UOB One $500 min spending? cos i don think i saw that in the exclusion list? thanks.,btohqsg
Hi all  any recommendations for a good cashback card for a large one-off online spend (they don‚Äôt accept Amex tho)  around 5-7k.. I was looking at the Citi Smrt card  but wondering if there‚Äôs any other non-Citi options with better cashback?,btohqsg
Grab MasterCard can't top-up ezlink card now?,btohqsg
Grab Mastercard cannot be used to topup any wallets now,btohqsg
citi smrt card is best for this. Next closest is Scb Manhatten that gives 3% capped at $200 in a quarter (i.e. $6667 spend),btohqsg
Add scb smart for Apple icloud or Google one or Google YouTube payment will earn scb smart points?,btohqsg
For the UOB Promo  with regards to Incremental Fresh Funds  does that include salary?,btohqsg
For jumpstart can I ask if using liquid pay to pay will count towards the cashback?,btohqsg
For students I guess the jumpstart debit card is the best card to use?,btohqsg
Best card if you spend <$400 a month,btohqsg
I haven't checked if DBS Live Fresh student card has min spending requirement,btohqsg
Once I start working after I grad uob one is the best?,btohqsg
I would say as college student pickmaybank evibes -> 1% cashback no conditionsdbs live fresh -> 5% pub tpt,btohqsg
Getting a student credit card builds credit score to help get ur working credit card more easily,btohqsg
why none talk about RHB HYSA promotion ? up to 5.5% EIR without any salary requirement,btohqsg
This seems better than ocbc and UOB account,btohqsg
yes but only for incremental balance  mean you need to take out your balance at following month (month 2) put somewhere else  before put back at month 3,btohqsg
Feels a lot like HSBC EGA promotion,btohqsg
It's alot less complicated than EGA  and also faster crediting of the additional interest compared to EGA,btohqsg
Just to update  interest for SIF GoSavers was credited on the last day of the month last month  they also show you the period for which the interest is for  a very good no-frills option for 2.5% pa,btohqsg
The base interest only 1.x %. The additional 3.5% only applies to the new funds. Example  u put in additional 500$  3.5% only on the 500$. Not the total amount 5%.,btohqsg
Can look at RHB like what Jackson shared,btohqsg
total interest base + bonus for your incremental balance of curent month compare with previous month balance,btohqsg
So  imagine I have 100k and every month I put in 1000. Then it would be 100k x 1.x % + 1000 x 3.5%? Is that correct ?,btohqsg
no month 1 will be 100k * (1.x +3.5%)  month 2 will be 1000 * (1.x +3.5%),btohqsg
thats why month 2 need to move out somewhere and month 3 bring back again in,btohqsg
can see example on this pagehttps://rhbgroup.com.sg/rhb/personal/CASA-Promotion,btohqsg
LOL ... I understand now. üòÑ,btohqsg
esaver SCB now better 3.8 % also no salary rrquirement,btohqsg
Like that ocbc 360 lose out liao.,btohqsg
Can someone enlighten me what is SIF GoSavers ? Thanks,btohqsg
Hmm till 31 Jan 2023 only tho,btohqsg
like this every month need to keep jumping lol,btohqsg
Also every mnth need to tell HR GIRO salary to new bank acct ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
hey guys I hope this is not a stupid qn but to hit the minimum spend for CC welcome gifts  does it just mean any spend as long as it meets the min? Like even pay back student loan  or top up grab card?,btohqsg
Education and grab top-up are well known exclusions for eligible spend,btohqsg
Both the RHB and EGA no salary crediting requirement,btohqsg
A fuss free online banking account that gives 2.5% p.a. on first $100k. Only need to maintain $1000 min balance,btohqsg

Hi what is the best card to earn mile point now? Each month will spent around 1k to 1.5k,btohqsg
Women world master card limit is 2K  but miles will expire after 12 months. And DBS exclude amaze as eligible transaction.Citi reward limit is 1k  travel category not eligible  it‚Äôs almost a MUST to pair it with Amaze card. Miles expire 5 years after the upon activation of the card. Has more airline to transfer.HSBC revo limit is 1k  includes travel category  cannot pair with Amaze card  miles expire after 36 months. Has fewer airline to transfer.,btohqsg
All these are 10x reward points or 4mpd. There are lesser reward but miles never expire.,btohqsg
Uob PPV And VS also offer 4mpd,btohqsg
If you use the contactless on UOB selected merchants you will get their cash back reward system instead of miles.,btohqsg
Really find that Citibank service sucks. HSBC is so much better.Informed HSBC to change my statement date. Within 3days is done. Citi on the other hand 2 weeks later still not done. I had to call and chase,btohqsg

"It really depends all in all what criteria can you hit  i personally moved amount i want to save up into UOB and any ""expected expenses"" for the month to OCBC 360(I personally can't hit the spend criteria w/ OCBC cause I got rejected for CC opening w/ OCBC  possibly due to me opening too much products this year. UOB One account allows me ot use debit card to hit the spend criteria so im probably going to use it for AXS payments for insurance :D)",btohqsg

Yes i am (be warned that you will need to pay an early account closure fee of $30 if you close a freshly opened account),btohqsg
May I know what is your strategy for both accounts? sorry for asking so much hahha,btohqsg
Everything UOB  expected spending put inside OCBC 360 each month till a year later then think again (fall below fees are waived for first year)The only purpose is really to pay off friends via GooglePay for me  do cash withdrawals and to do payments to my credit cards via FAST where applicable (not sure if UOB offers this service)For hitting $500  probably will use it all on insurance payments with AXS (i lose out on the 1.5/1.7 percent via grabpay-AMEX this way however),btohqsg
So your salary crediting will be into UOB  then OCBC is for spending and just to keep the account alive?,btohqsg
if want close i think (this one i haven't really cnfirmed) better to do it after 6 months to avoid early termination tho  but whether this will hurt relationship with the bank  that idk... (or if there's even such a thing) üò¨Cause after a year there will be the concern of that fall below fee,btohqsg
pay axs valid for min spend criteria on UOB ONe Card ?,btohqsg
ohh  which credit card you got from UOB?,btohqsg
Can ask for UOB1 credit card spend for the $500 does paying prudential insurance with uob1 credit card consider a spend?,btohqsg

if i link citibank cash back (fnb and groceries) to amaze  and use amaze to pay for restaurants local and overseas  will the payment be eligible for cashback? Does amaze convert the fnb category into online category?,btohqsg
all transactions get converted iirc  with MCC being passed,btohqsg
Means the fnb spend  even overseas  will be eligible for cash back  right?,btohqsg
Anyone knows this can share with me thanks a lot üôèüèª,btohqsg

Hi guys  the best way to topupcrypto.comis still via GrabPay Card with Revolut card? ü§î,btohqsg
Grab cannot top up revolut now,btohqsg
Via this way what do you earn?,btohqsg
Noob here. Self-employed person  trying to apply for Citi PremierMiles Card. Got rejected but based on my NOA for past 2 years  definitely fullfil income requirement. Citibank did not give reasons  anyone has similar experience?,btohqsg
Grab cannot topup to Revolut anymore,btohqsg
He is asking to top up tocrypto.comcard isn't it ?,btohqsg
Amex top up to grab. Grab top up tocrypto.com,btohqsg
Grab now blocks topups to Revolut andCrypto.com,btohqsg
Grab can still top up tocrypto.com,btohqsg
do take note once topped to CDC.. You cant topup to revo or youtrip or grab with CDC itself so only can spend it,btohqsg
if u got rejected u can request for a free credit report,btohqsg
self employed i guess no contrubuton to cpf so no recordso got rejected,btohqsg
if not u can put in 10k as secure credit card application as some banks allows,btohqsg
Any one can advise how long it takes for Lazada transaction to be from pending to completed?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  for those using Nestia pay  how to check if the 10% cashback had been credited? Been using it for a month now but dun see any cashback at all.,btohqsg
If for cpf and srs investing  anytime is good,btohqsg
Am I right to say as of now  there are no UOB credit cards that can use in conjuction with Amaze to earn miles? Citi cards are the only options?,btohqsg
I thought UOB KrisFlyer non-SQ spend should work out leh? (I also hear SQ spend also counted ‚Ä¶ but won‚Äôt risk it if I haven‚Äôt reach 800 min spend),btohqsg
Hi noob here   any recommendation of banks for FD around 200k,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt grab top up to cdc there is a $1 fee to every $100 top up?,btohqsg
GPMC is debit card so free top up to CDC. Been doing it recently  can confirmed no fees. Fees only for credit card if not wrong,btohqsg
1.7% cashback from UOB AMEX Absolute top up to GPMC. No other earn I think but CDC only accept MC/Visa not Amex.,btohqsg
In short: You may consider investing in stocks bah,btohqsg
Aren‚Äôt the FDs lower than UOB One ah (much more liquid and if you have card spend anyway  reasonable). If really no idea and don‚Äôt want to deal with UOB One  then yeah may take the FDs you recommend bah üëçüèªüëçüèª,btohqsg
Correct. Will discuss in todays video,btohqsg
Any credit card earn points from paying to a doctor specialist?,btohqsg
yes use UOB PPV if accept paywave (private specialist) or use NUH one app pay online use Citi Rewards MC (for NUH specialist). Based on my own experience last few months. Got 4 mpd,btohqsg
HSBC revo most likely not get,btohqsg
Just thought if amaze gets nerfed. Can still link CitiRewards card to LiquidPay and make QR payments for FnB/Retail expenses to earn 10x pts  as it still classified as online payment üòÖ,btohqsg
When a major nerf happens  there will be two groups of people:1) Ranting and whining about the nerf and cannot get over it2) Move on and find new hacks going forward. No big deal.Hint: Don't be in the first group,btohqsg
Can just check if uob1 credit card pay ntuc income insurance also consider spending right?,btohqsg
Now haven‚Äôt nerf also can link to right,btohqsg
1 card can link to multiple account,btohqsg
Hi all  I just recieved my citi rewards + instarem amaze cards and am gathering some tips on how to use it (was previously using amex -> grab/youtrip as 1 card solution but decided to shift after nerfs) Do you all use instarem amaze as 1 card solution for everything in SG to earn 4mpd? any exclusions to take note off? Should I change all my billing (i.e.  netflix  spotify  fitness first  telco plan) to instarem amaze card?,btohqsg
Just tried.Looks like can.But I didn't complete the transaction as I have already paid.Will update next month,btohqsg
Agree. If have new hacks just make hay / do these hacks. If no hack or nerf then at most shrug lor,btohqsg
Need to wait 90-120days to redeem the offer,btohqsg
Best hack to fall back on is always Marie Kondo ConceptSpend less and minimalist  never go wrong.,btohqsg

Throwing it out rhere if anyone has a good solution for renovation payment where I can maximise points / miles / or cashback discount etc.. My vendor has only provided paynow uen and bank account.Any good smart ideas are greatly appreciated!,btohqsg
hey guys  just curious on how to read CitiReward point breakdown statement. Above points transactions dated 4 Dec  does it related to the payment transaction made with credit card on 4 Dec?,btohqsg
Just used grapcard to pay for uniqlo. 0 pts.,btohqsg
more like posted on 4 dec,btohqsg

My bad  thought you were referring to the hawker 50c off promo. I'm not sure how this one works.,btohqsg
First come first serve  fully redeem,btohqsg
Such promotion maybe fully redeem without any notice  only spend then u know get or not. Exact redemption is not reveal as like any promotion,btohqsg
Query: Why cant i sell a cash secured put on Webull SG? I have the margin account and the cash in the account to cover my stock price.I keep getting the prompt: Short Selling Options is currently not supported.,btohqsg
Which bank provide the best FD rate?,btohqsg
UOB Privi Miles can also  but you only need to pair it for oversea/Foreign currency transactions. Locally no need to use amaze except for convenience of just bringing one amaze card.,btohqsg
Citi one is quite tough to see whether miles are awarded for which transactions. Yeah most prob date of transaction posted. I prefer UOB in this aspect of transparency   they show itemised on miles earned etc.,btohqsg
not true  uob prvi mastercard  uob lady  uob krisflyer should work with Amaze so long MCC eligible,btohqsg
Hello! Silly question.Is it better to be doing voluntary housing loan payment or topping up to CPF OA to enjoy tax relief?,btohqsg
Likely they'll push out more features of options trading in future  which may include selling naked/cash covered options...,btohqsg
1) No  since interest rates outside of CPFOA is easily 3-4%.2) You cannot top-up to OA directly  so not even for tax relief,btohqsg
Yup.... Just sharing what I've heard on other chatgrps....,btohqsg
For first card folks it is still the same to me as 40 yo folksEveryone's use case is differentIf really don't know any better  use a debit card first and see which one you spend on  the total amounts  proportion etcbe honest  which kind of spending is every month sure have  which kind of spending is need  and which kind variable.For now  UOB EVOL might be the card to go if paired with UOB One account  though be careful of conditions that are Unlike Other Banks,btohqsg
If you're a miles guy or into it sure (and yes it's my one card to go before the 1k cap)  exceptions when I dont use the card is for SimplyGo  insurances and travel related expenses,btohqsg
Hi  I have an upcoming prudential insurance payment. Would like to find out if there is any credit card or method to pair cards together for cashback/miles.,btohqsg
Pretty much is the 1.5/1.7 amex card with grabpay before it is nerfed..,btohqsg
For UOB EVOL card  is it possible to get more than $40 cashback after hitting the $500 spend in mobile contactless and online categories by spending the remaining $100 on visa payWave transactions?,btohqsg
Yes. Heads up that its like few cents worth more cashback. Tried it before.,btohqsg
The max for online and mobile contactless is max 40,btohqsg
So you need to clock via the third category. The remaining 20 bucks like tapping your card physically at the store. Sorry i wasnt clear earlier,btohqsg
Hi I got a question how long it takes for insteram to deliver the amaze card upon application approved?,btohqsg
Actually I also applied citi reward card at the same time time with insteram.Citibank approved and already send me the physical card things have settled down with but the insteram is still pending on card to arrive,btohqsg
ya dont know wait how long no eta,btohqsg
For the UOB one accountIf i buy ntuc vouchers / groceries vouchers  any recommendations for the credit card or any also ok?,btohqsg
I've applied amaze back in Oct  received within 10 biz days ....#justsharing,btohqsg
Amex true Cashback can get cash back from hospital & GP & specialist payment?,btohqsg
should be ok (don't think tcb has exceptions),btohqsg
Thank you  i guess have to wait for 5 more days,btohqsg
Cashback gets credited upon statement date i think,btohqsg
Received from Syfe. Does anyone know what is this? Does it mean there will be add. 10% of tax when selling the stocks?,btohqsg
Believe pairing it will exclude you from earning rewards (UOB KF TnCs),btohqsg
Was thinking if there‚Äôs still cash back if I use GrabPay/GPMC (via AXS) to pay Amex credit card bill‚Ä¶ by first topping up my Grabpay using Amex? üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
dont think u can use GPMC to pay credit card bills on axs tho... ü§®,btohqsg
Not all amaze transactions. Only amaze transactions with transit i think,btohqsg
oo my bad  thought it meant them as seperate pairing,btohqsg
I may be wrong. Maybe someone has dp on it,btohqsg
Seems possible  need to use the web-based AXS & use PayNow QR,btohqsg
*seems possible for other credit cards. But don‚Äôt know if cashback will be given if I use GrabPay to pay Amex,btohqsg
You'll have to close the loop someday right?,btohqsg
I notice there isnt an option to pay trust card bill using AXS e station. Am I getting it right?,btohqsg
Isn't AXS excluded from UOB min spend?,btohqsg
You can't use AXS to pay any Credit Card bills. If you want to get the UOB AMEX cashback  it will be insurance or town council or any other payment that is not Credit Card via AXS.,btohqsg
But take note if you use the UOB AMEX CC  it won't be included inside the $500 monthly spend each month.,btohqsg
cannot use Amex card on AXS lah. Can use uob amex topup grab get cashback  then use grab pay via Paynow QR on AXS website,btohqsg
Oh haha yes  so sorry I miss out on the Grabpay part hahaha,btohqsg
of cos not eligible (as answered earlier),btohqsg
"Yes. ""free brokerage"" what do you expect. Of course there is some trade offI think u better ask webull directly to confirm.",btohqsg
Imo  they're rushing to push out a product that's half-done  lure users to it with promos  and slowly push out more features on the app ....,btohqsg
To justify to investors they've got alot of customers base...,btohqsg
Don't think Citi rewards or cash back plus or Citi mrt got point on paying to hospital or GP or specialist,btohqsg
hehe ya couldn't find the TnCs and assumed under all spend  will do payment via the insurance app instead,btohqsg
Has anyone managed to pay AXA premiums with debit/credit cards without using AXS?,btohqsg
If I have Trust card  am I consider new to SC bank when applying SC Smart Card? Previously no other SC card.,btohqsg
Hi Chris  do you DM your subscribers here on Telegram? If you did  i kinda blocked you. Lol,btohqsg
It depends. Used Citi Cashback+ at Mount E A&E and specialist visit. All got 1.6% cashback,btohqsg
Anyone used Citi SMRT to pay for StarHub bill via online and got the 5% cashback? Asking as I burst my CRMC for this month üòÇ,btohqsg
I recall most cc exclude healthcare payment too like doctor or hospital,btohqsg
I also not sure. Just used whichever card to try out,btohqsg
Grab pay cannot use for vending machine ‚Ä¶ wth,btohqsg
https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-platinum-visa-card.pagethis is like amex TCB ? No excluded McC?,btohqsg
So it work like amex TCB except grab top up no nee to worry of certain McC us not exclude maybe hospital too and utilities don't know if simply go it's excluded as there is no t&c,btohqsg
Looks like never state excluded hospital or utility,btohqsg
A good alternative to low spender I suppose with 3.33,btohqsg
So can stack $500 to uob one and get 3% and $300 to Maybank plat visa for 3.33%,btohqsg
Unless can spend 1k rhen go for uob one ?,btohqsg
hi for cimb fixed deposits  am I allowed to apply for more than 1 fixed deposit(like 3 diff time duration)?https://www.cimb.com.sg/en/personal/banking-with-us/accounts/fixed-deposit/cimb-sgd-fixed-deposit-account.html,btohqsg
or like apply today for 6mth time period  and then next week after my salary comes in  i apply again another 6mth time period?,btohqsg
yes. but for most utility  uob one give bonus 1% cashback so better to use uob one,btohqsg
Ya just split up in between,btohqsg
Hsbc Revo give appox 2.2% with no min spending,btohqsg
So it atiol Lower then Maybank plat visa,btohqsg
Another perks is Maybank support Samsung pay can earn some point too but HSBC Revo only google pay no points,btohqsg
Amex TCB for SGQR as replacement for grab nerf,btohqsg
2.5% or 4mpd. I prefer the 4mpd,btohqsg
Ya But not going fir The miles chase,btohqsg

Hi  I have GIRO Individual income tax with IRAS that will debit from my bank account 7th of every month. Recently I came across video to pay income tax using GPMC+ UOB AB. I paid this month instalment amount 1 Dec. Again GIRO debited 7th Dec. Any idea why is this happening? Am I missing out anything? Pls help. Thanks in advance,btohqsg
You should set the payment earlier  about 2 weeks before the 7th,btohqsg
IRAS would refund you in a few days ... do not worry on overpaying.,btohqsg
refund only if already fully paid for year right?,btohqsg
next month giro deduction will minus away the amount you overpaid.,btohqsg
Uob one if setup recurring vill payment like SP power geneco singtel from their website or app is it consider as giro so is met their require as this,btohqsg
these recurring bill payment charged to card should be counted.,btohqsg
Usually I pay around 20-22  all are good,btohqsg
No refund  they will readjust your monthly for lower amount,btohqsg
Hi all  for TBILLS  if want to invest CPFOA with DBS bank  the cutoff date is -2 days from issue date or auction date ?,btohqsg

it is based on posted date. Will be counted in next month if posted next month,btohqsg

Looks like after uob hyped up the %% now uob one is hot üî• cakes card to apply good luck to all getting it and not getting delayed,btohqsg
Can check for uob1 paying insurance premium will it be using uob evol card is the best? As evol still consider insurance premium as spending,btohqsg
Hi DBS Card fellas  are these DBS Points offset for 30% cashback promos a good deal?,btohqsg
Posting my topic once more... Hopefully there's some good response :/Throwing it out rhere if anyone has a good solution for renovation payment where I can maximise points / miles / or cashback discount etc.. My vendor has only provided paynow uen and bank account.Any good smart ideas are greatly appreciated!,btohqsg
Got 1 approved Liao haven‚Äôt delivered. ü§£,btohqsg
If you are planning to convert dbs points to miles then probably not worth it. Miles are generally valued higher than the amount you can offset in cash. Unless you need to use up the dbs points before they expire soon and there is not enough to convert to miles (min amount is 5000 dbs points to convert to 10000 miles).,btohqsg
You can either use UOB Absolute > Grab then use Grab to pay  or use a card that gives rewards for using CardUp or IPayMy,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think grab can work  unless they have a qr code yes?,btohqsg
can generate QR from the uen.https://sslsecure.maybank.com.sg/cgi-bin/mbs/scripts/mbb_cas/mbb_cas_qrcodegen_mbs.jsp,btohqsg
Hi all  i got a silly question.. if I have $75000 in cimb fastsaver  can i apply for cimb visa infinite card? üòÇ,btohqsg
Does the vendor need to generate or I can?,btohqsg
insurance only clocks to the $500 card spend for the purpose of uob one bonus interest  does not clocks to card rebate. So does not matter uob evol or uob one card.,btohqsg
not sure what u mean  there are a whole long list of exclusions for the $500 card spend for uob one account bonus  interest. Insurance is the one of the very few exception that clocks to bonus interest  other exclusions on uob one card also applies to uob one account card spend for bonus interest.,btohqsg
Juat Wait lor since u already approved it's a matter time,btohqsg
So u meaning for the uob1 acc spend of $500  for insurance doesn‚Äôt matter I charge to evol or uob1 credit card.,btohqsg
you mean evol gives cashback for insurance? that's good to know.,btohqsg
or you mean insurance only counted to meet the minimum spend?,btohqsg
Dude... I think this is only for maybank. Not suited for other banks yea?,btohqsg
it should be a common standard to generate the QR. there are many other ready made generators - you can Google. I can't paste link as it's deleted by bot.,btohqsg
Insurance only can meet uob1 acc criteria for spending but not uob1 card criteria of spending. Hope that clarify.,btohqsg
Anyone know if uob1 credit card if u can‚Äôt hit the $500 spending then what will the cash back be? Cause understand if u hit $500 spending monthly will entitle for quarterly rebate. But if can‚Äôt hit $500 spending then will the cash back still be at 3.33% or will it be like 0.3%?,btohqsg
If u low spender get Maybank is not bad too 3.33%https://www.maybank2u.com.sg/en/personal/cards/credit/maybank-platinum-visa-card.page?sc=acq2&utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_campaign=platvisa&utm_term=broad&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7bucBhCeARIsAIOwr-_GhIMvhtlN6RkBe_zzINVOStAUlXyH1V9GLH7qdy6IVq2DcKDPtpoaAtRIEALw_wcB,btohqsg
so if I use UOB One card to pay insurance  I can get the bonus interest for the savings account right? that's nice to know.,btohqsg
Simply spend a minimum of S$300 every month for each quarter and get up to S$100 cashback!For Maybank,btohqsg
not bad.. $300x3 get back $30 at least is 3.33%,btohqsg
ideal if already have recurrent payments that you can control to only spend $300 per month.,btohqsg
Take note only apple & Samsung pay supported,btohqsg
else if one month accidentally miss will become BBQ lor  like the  UOB one card,btohqsg
300$ per month is much easy to meet,btohqsg
then no good. I was thinking maybe phone bill. then cannot already.,btohqsg
the troublesome part is the monthly effort to make sure exceed $300 slightly only to maximise cashback.,btohqsg
Not surely if utility id excluded,btohqsg
next year need to rethink of strategy. many changes recently to card and bank terms.,btohqsg
Best simple go card is now still SCb smart,btohqsg
But can this be tag with any card? To achieve more cash back?,btohqsg
Grab Revo amazing all nerf or not allowed,btohqsg
Don't expect to double triple dip like before,btohqsg
Oh well If u consider this as a double dipAdd to Samsung pay earn point cum Maybank 3.33%,btohqsg
the good old days mostly gone now. haha,btohqsg
I'm earing from amex TCB & grab & Samsung pay,btohqsg
the best of the best was the initial beginning when even pay income tax earn grab points,btohqsg
Triplets dip beforehand now onky Samsung pay and card point,btohqsg
tcb and grab I can't use already max for the year. next month can again.,btohqsg

Revo only support bank/ visa / Master,btohqsg
Take notes Visa too up will incurred fee soon,btohqsg
haiz  ic thanks. thought finally found a work around,btohqsg
I called  cimb before on applying the infinite card without meeting the 120 k annual income. It is not about 50 k in fast saver. You need to put one year FD (not 18 mths) and must cancel the credit card before withdraw fd accordingly to the staff. Was told such FD must place in branch personally. I suspect they make you sign some documents to use the FD fund if you don't pay your credit cardbills. Anyone has more details can share? Don't know if I should apply card first or go bank first.,btohqsg
Don't worry bank already know all the hack's to excluded all benefits to us haha,btohqsg
how you plan to maximise the infinite card?,btohqsg
Anyone can clarify if i still get 10x rewards if i use amaze + citi rewards at watsons  guardian  decathalon  tog game shop  cold storage?,btohqsg

How about using grabpay in msia üëç?,btohqsg
I am not sure about this.. wouldnt it trigger a forex transaction for this? It may end up counter intuitive..,btohqsg
For simplicity.. maybe just have a citi cash back + plus amaze.. citi cash back + no min spending..,btohqsg
Is it worth it when you convert grab rewards points to krisflyer miles?,btohqsg
GrabPay card's forex fee is 0.8% iirc. Lower than most banks  but nothing compared multi-currency cards,btohqsg
Hey all  I need to hit $500 spend by tmr for SC SMRT card to get $300 cashback  but my funds that I made with the card 2 days ago (bough e-capita vouchers) is still listed as 'unposted' in the app  will it be counted as $500 spend even if its still 'unposted' after tmr?*SC hotline is terrible  am trying to contact them since the morning and unable to,btohqsg
It is same mcc as ezlink,btohqsg
Have call bank to ask already,btohqsg
Trying to call since morning :(((,btohqsg
I didnt know same as ezlink...thanks for this!! Fairprice vouchers via shopback should be no issue right?,btohqsg
But now ecapitavoucher got promotion with dbs card,btohqsg
Bought the fairprice vouchers  but funds still 'unposted' in app  anyone knows where to find the SC live chat? Their hotline is literally useless,btohqsg
It will take a few working day for pending to become posted,btohqsg
guys i have a question if i want pay my insurance with axs be it physical machine or axs online with my uob1 debit card can it still qualify under the uob1 acc spending?,btohqsg
Curious. I just got my Amaze cashback and it says it went to the Amaze Wallet. Where can i find that to spend it or does it go back to whatever card is actively assigned to the Amaze card?,btohqsg
Just watched the video  need some clarification. Previously@ChrisHMSGmention Citi reward doesn't include travel category as eligible spending. Let's say I go JB and swap Amaze + Citi reward on retail shopping or massage  do I still get 4mpd?,btohqsg
"Go to where u select card to use  select ""Amaze Wallet""  use Amaze card to use the cashback",btohqsg
For this  we will not get any bank exchange rate charges right as it will be based on amaze exchange rate only uh,btohqsg
It will follow Amaze FX rate,btohqsg
yes 4mpd so long mcc not excluded. Travel category refers to flight/hotel/car rental etc. which are excluded in the TnC for citi rewards,btohqsg
Awesome  then I don't need to swap my card when I go JB.,btohqsg
If I use my amaze card to insert instead  it will also count right? For 4mpd,btohqsg
As I‚Äôm going to korea where they don‚Äôt accept wireless payment.,btohqsg
So citi+amaze combo can also be used to pay hospital bills and insurance premiums?,btohqsg
So we need to top up minimum $20 in the amaze wallet first to use the amaze card and get the cashback,btohqsg
Are we able to transfer out the money from amaze wallet?,btohqsg
if i used UOB one card to pay singtel bill via mysingtel app  a) does it count under the min $500 spend criteria for interest bonus?  b) is it eligible for cashback also?,btohqsg

Base on other YT channel  they can use Youtrip in korea. So I guess Amaze works as well,btohqsg
These are the standard no reward no matter what.,btohqsg
Anyone know what card I can use to top up Tribecar?,btohqsg
Good news? Seem like lesser rewards?,btohqsg
So instead of amaze+ Citi  is it better to go for YouTrip + Citi instead? Or better for amaze + Citi as it will convert everything into eligible spending for 4mpd except travel related.,btohqsg
So u getting this Maybank Visa?,btohqsg
You can't topup youtrip with Citi. It's bank transfer or paynow i think. Has not been using youtrip for a long while.,btohqsg
My main oversea spending is JB  so I'll just citi + Amaze and wise card. Wise card is more of a safety net incase I run out of cash in JB and need it immediately.,btohqsg
Like in the video  alot people used youtrip to convert SGD to Yen first.,btohqsg
nice. I was not sure now this can help contribute to  plan for monthly clocking on UOB one card + account,btohqsg
If i am not wrong  insurance premium is counted for interest bonus but not eligible for cashback.,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt use wise yet so not sure about it. All along using YouTrip pair with grab and UOB absolute,btohqsg
yup  now the grab side nerfed youtrip topup...,btohqsg
Ya lo that‚Äôs why switching to amaze haha,btohqsg
Can pair Amaze with grab card?,btohqsg
Why this time amex tcb offer [Nov] so late still have not cash rebate the offers like utilities offer  telco offers and online shopping offers? Anyone has same issue? Normally just a few days.,btohqsg
Depends which hospital I guess? And if u pay it via healthhub app or sth?,btohqsg
Tried it when i first got my Amaze card. Doesn't work,btohqsg
How do u guys top up youtrip?,btohqsg
Can i check if DBSWMMC on apply pay  does it earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Helloooooo!Is anyone using SIF Gosavers Acc? How is the experience like?,btohqsg
yes hospital mcc not excluded for citibank,btohqsg
I'm using it as my main savings acc rn. Pretty good so far  got my 2.5% interest earlier this month.,btohqsg
Yep same just tried grab banned,btohqsg
for hospital - usually for private hospitals it's counted for most cards.,btohqsg
Btw what is your net cash back ?For jb expense thx ü§î,btohqsg
not true. hospital mcc excluded on many cards,btohqsg
I'm surprised Citi cards didn't excluded health Care like doctor payment,btohqsg
Can we use amaze for contactless payment n simplygo?,btohqsg
Previously I'm using citi cashback +  1.6% Only recently decide to change to miles game,btohqsg
Ya 1.6 is pretty low I feel at least 3%,btohqsg
Need to read up the credit card T&C.,btohqsg
for no minimum spending and no limit. I think 1.6% is pretty good,btohqsg
Oh well ya better then nothing,btohqsg
Does Citi Rewards card have minimum spend?,btohqsg
Have anyone received their OCBC 360 interest?,btohqsg
for amaze+citi rewards  will the MCC be forwarded to citi rewards or any spend via amaze will work?,btohqsg
MCC will not change and will be charged to CRMC as such.,btohqsg
ahh ok thanks for the clarification,btohqsg
Amaze is only changing the transaction type to ‚Äúonline‚Äù. Let‚Äôs say you go McDonald and use contactless. Amaze will convert ‚Äúcontactless‚Äù payment to ‚Äúonline‚Äù payment as though you ordered McDonald via their online app.McDonald‚Äôs MCC still need to be eligible.,btohqsg
Does anybody know if you can still use UOB absolute cashback paired with gpmc for cashback on cpf top ups?,btohqsg
for SC Smart Card  does anyone know when the additional 360 reward points are gonna be credited to the account? I read the TnC but cannot find any info about it,btohqsg
Check your statement it not automatic u need to redeem,btohqsg
Give it 2-3 days after the statement date..,btohqsg
Well said and explained. Effective 4% nett cashback when CitiRewards paired with Amaze card. Clearly superior to YouTrip IMO. Overseas cash withdrawal better with Revolut as there‚Äôs no charge for first $350 atm withdrawal üòÖ,btohqsg
No more points for Amaze card with UOB lady's card,btohqsg
"actually tapping Amaze for bus/mrt is not ""Amaze* Transit*""",btohqsg
Anyone facing issue where OCBC FAST transfer to other banks is only on the next day (and not immediate)?,btohqsg
How to make the FAST transfer immediate?,btohqsg
All along is immediately unless u keys in wring account or the bank got issues?,btohqsg
Some banks only will post it the follow day  but the transaction is dated to ur transfer rate.I use OCBC to pay my CC billsStandard Chartered and UOB reflect next day but datedIf u are referring to this,btohqsg
Guys  UOB One Account promotion has got 4-5 valid cards.Will I be eligible if $500 is split up between those eligible cards in a month ?,btohqsg
That‚Äôs right  if you are comparing within multi currency wallet  revolut is better for withdrawal. But revolut charge you 1% weekend fee.So I‚Äôll use youtrip for swipe card in JB and revolut for cash withdrawal.,btohqsg
I transfer RM back to Malaysia every month using Revolut. Previously I could do UOB Amex - Grab - Revolut and earn 1.7% on that monthly transaction. Now that Grab has nerfed that  the only choice I have is to use my other Visa/Master to top up Revolut directly since Revolut don't accept Amex. I'm resigned to not earning an 'extras' for doing my monthly RM Revolut transfer unless any one here got any else to recommend?,btohqsg
I have never remit money before. But I rmb seeing on YT people test using Maybank  CIMB and wise to remit money from SGD to RM.Can‚Äôt really earn extra  but you can find out which method has better rates.,btohqsg
Only amaze*transit  other mcc should work,btohqsg
good morning all  just joined. I'm going to buy a few big ticket items for new house  wondering which cash back cards can maximum opportunity for this. any one can share tips? thanks!,btohqsg
I guess it is really which merchant u plan to buy from and what mcc that merchant is,btohqsg
Hi  just checking if I have USD in dbs multiplier  how do I transfer out without incurring those remittance charges? Can I transfer to broker or e-wallet like youtrip/revolut?,btohqsg
Courts  Harvey  best  gain  ikea  you can use ocbc titanium. Can spend up to 13k a year for 4mpd.Other cards like uob ppc and hsbc revo also suitable but you need break up to $1k payment a month.,btohqsg
These are generally miles card though... Although I think they can convert the points into cash. Need double check.,btohqsg
Wtf why is there a delay in withdrawing my Syfe Wealth Assets? Who else received this?,btohqsg
If ordering online  Citi SMRT is nice 5% cash back,btohqsg

Is Instarem Amaze suitable to be pair with cashback card like maybank fam & friends? Or is it only suitable for miles cards? If transactions converted to online transaction means it won't qualify under the various cashback categories for maybank f&f?,btohqsg

suitable for categories that award based on MCC. Get 8% for eligible MCC. MCC will be kept though payment mode gets converted to online. Not suitable for those categories that award based on merchant name  as merchant change to Amaze.,btohqsg
Can anyone explain to me how to get the 5% cash back from Citi rewards card ? I thought it's a miles card,btohqsg
Chris value miles at 1.25cents per mile,btohqsg
I feel like that part of the video wasn't well explained. Chris values a mile at 1.25c  so getting 4mpd to him is like getting 5% cashback. You can't actually get 5% cashback with the card,btohqsg
Is there no other ways to top up Revolut/youtrip by routing thru any other platforms using UOB Absolute?,btohqsg
for UOB KF  does anyone know for the $800 spend on SIA group for the extra 1.8mpd - does the travel have to be by the expiry date? or as long as i purchase it by then?,btohqsg
as long as charged and posted to card,btohqsg
does Maybank Platinum Visa Card work with google pay?,btohqsg
would contactless such as Pay wave work?,btohqsg
DBS women world card   is paywave considered for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Anybody know if DBS bank DBS remit possible to transfers USD to other USD account at Singapore banks? From DBS website they only mention overseas transfer,btohqsg
But how does one mile value to 1.25cents ? How to get this calculation?,btohqsg
anyone still keeping money in singlife or already transfer out to put in higher interest accounts/fixed-d/Tbills etc?,btohqsg
I'm keeping money in my SIF GoSavers account  2.5%p.a. with no hoops,btohqsg
The value of a mile is entirely subjective. one mile = 1.25 because I say so. one mile can also be worth 0.67 cents simply because I say so.,btohqsg

Hahaha.. I see.. thanks for clearing it up for me,btohqsg
The min value of a mile is 0.95c  this is the value you can use to offset the price of an air ticket.The max value of a mile is wat a bank is willing to sell you at  currently 1.92cAnything in between is highly subjective. Anyway i will cover in a video if there is enough intwrest,btohqsg
For the latest t bill if you applied competitive at 4%   would u get 4% or still get the cutoff 4.4%?,btohqsg
Yes please. For all these years I'm only into Cashback card. Never really understand how the miles card will benefit me,btohqsg
Any credit card that gives 4mpd for air ticket purchases aside from revolution?,btohqsg
For the amaze card (paired with citi rewards)  do we still get 10x if paid via Favepay?,btohqsg
Just realised that when I link GPMC to ShopBack and pay via ShopBack  I‚Äôll still get 6 points for every $1 spent.,btohqsg
Not sure if you link GPMC to all those favepay  shopeepay and ShopBack and use them for payment will you get grab points reward.Need some volunteers here to test.,btohqsg
Anyone tried using ShopeePay > Top up using UOB Absolute > Transfer to bank account (eg. for rental purpose),btohqsg
Hey everyone if I‚Äôm a fresh grad and I don‚Äôt have much savings  Which savings account would be best? And what about credit card? I‚Äôm alright with cash or miles!,btohqsg
Do note that you can link your Citi Rewards card directly to FavePay to earn 4mpd  no need to link to Amaze then link to FavePay,btohqsg

If more than 1k  which card will be better? Thank you.,btohqsg
DBS wwmc would be good for online air ticket booking if less than 2k per month,btohqsg
Why use Grab for 1.2% when you can just link credit cards for 5%/4mpd,btohqsg
You can start with some of the 2.5% p.a. interest accounts like Jumpstart  Trust bank etc until you have significant savings and spend pattern  then you can look at OCBC 360 or UOB One,btohqsg
Anyone know which credit card can top up Tribecar??,btohqsg
