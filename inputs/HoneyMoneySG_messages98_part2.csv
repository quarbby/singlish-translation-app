This one if I'm the bank I also block... Like pretty sus if you not there in person,btohqsg
Btw.. the cut off timing is for uob only? Or is it nationwide? (Ya i can test with my ocbc) i am just wondering it there some central control where a flick of switch  all banks change into next business day.,btohqsg
ya sia..keh kiang troubles to get replacement card..haha,btohqsg
Yes for UOB only. DBS still show 30 Mar.,btohqsg
Lol  you are right. ocbc also  still show 30th march. Later the banks ban the two of us. So sus keep transferring small amts lol,btohqsg
It's likely the rest is 11pm while UOB is 10:35pm-1040pm. HSBC also showing 1 Apr before 11pm.,btohqsg
Confirm have. I think is rhb,btohqsg
"So there is no central switch. All banks ""knock off"" at slightly different timesüòÖ",btohqsg
DBS still reflect 30 Mar after 11pm. Maybe in the morning will update as 1 Apr. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
If after 12am  still reflect as 30th march then will be super wierd..,btohqsg
Don't think you can transfer from 12am-4am because of their daily maintenance. I might be wrong,btohqsg
Got someone live chat Uob Cso. 1st April onwards maybe everyone can apply lady savings account. Not just females.,btohqsg
Later end up the CSO kuku thought they meant the card ü§°,btohqsg
wah uob one account cash rebate and cashback masuk liao,btohqsg
Hmm can‚Äôt see anything yet. But usually after 11pm Uob systems quite wonky one.,btohqsg
Hihi  for those hv uob lady‚Äôs solitaire card  do u hv any issue to waive the annual fee?,btohqsg
Yeap looks like wallet by budget baker,btohqsg
What happen if I applied separately  am I losing out on anything?,btohqsg
UOB one account interest credited but still not yet one bonus interest credited.,btohqsg
I transferred my UOB One account balance to my other account on 30th March at 7 am  leaving only 1K in the UOB One account. However  when I checked now  it is now not showing $0 as the monthly average for March; instead  it is showing the full amount  like 50K. Why is this happening?,btohqsg
anyone received cashback from SC on 27/1 marked with 52CASHBACKLNY  I have no idea if any promo,btohqsg
Morning all  if I make a card transition on 31 Mar  but the transaction gets posted on 02 aprWill I get miles/cashback for Mar or Apr? Thank you,btohqsg
Why need to empty UOB one account?,btohqsg
Not true  it is depend on what bank card u use,btohqsg
Hi all..apparently i was charged 1% convienience fees when i auto reload from trust to tng card ? Anyway ard it ? I was paired on savings accts not credit card,btohqsg
Posted date within the calender month,btohqsg
the bank doesn't process on weekends  hence people transferred out on 28/3,btohqsg
Not true  sat is a working day unless it is public holiday on sat,btohqsg
UOB Stash account interest in today  remember to withdraw by today.,btohqsg
TnG charges 1% on Credit Card top-up,btohqsg
Hi moomoo users. Does any one know how this moomoo yield coupon works?Is it similar to the 6.8% guaranteed return concept? (Except its only 5%  max 10k and for 10days only)Anyone has any experience on this?,btohqsg
So using iChange better ? Considered as debit card ?,btohqsg
No way to withdraw out today. It will be treated as withdraw on 01 April.,btohqsg
Maybe check again if you're paired with Trust card instead,btohqsg
Withdraw today still will be considered as Apr's withdrawal,btohqsg
I just keep only $1000 in my UOB one account and the rest I withdraw on 30th March at 7am but still the monthly average balance for the month of March is $50k not $1K.,btohqsg
Your MAB won‚Äôt be zero but your day end balance will be zero.,btohqsg
Right... And the math is correct.. what's the issue? üòÖ,btohqsg
Should be EDB at $1000.. haha,btohqsg
Do know the difference between MAB and end of balance and what in the tnc is asking for.,btohqsg
You understanding is correct  click use before subscribing to the eligible fund,btohqsg
Yes  but iChange like having some issues to top-up TnG for now,btohqsg
I think they disabled the feature. Got some announcement.,btohqsg
So we all can now see the Uob one base interest credited for value 30th March and there is no way to get the $4 out except on value date 1st April. So those who select rising phoenix $100 000 and keep only a $100 000.00 balance throughout will fail the earmark checking criteria which is $4 + $100 000 requirement.,btohqsg
Is it every quarter if UOB launch promo you will send reminder? ü§£,btohqsg
I try to share when I can Loh. Although still got people scold me being too naggy and repetitive as they don‚Äôt care about such small money.,btohqsg
But touch my heart I really feel happy when I see many people benefit.But also get a bit irritated when I already mention the clear (yes maybe kiasi) steps on how to do it but people refuse to follow and end up don‚Äôt qualify.,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ who will scold you wor.. you send already give 2 hours later ppl will ask again..,btohqsg
Please continue your sharing  I think it's a good reminder to those who are new to this savings promotion,btohqsg
"""In this case  the MONTHLY AVERAGE BALANCE for March 2024 doesn‚Äôt matter  but the end day balance only matters is it?",btohqsg
