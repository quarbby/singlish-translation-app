Hey guys  tried to make a still photo into a roller using pixlr eHow is it,btohqsg
abit too much motion blur too look realistic imo,btohqsg
considering the context of the shot and all,btohqsg
Not bad but the wheels do wrongly  the wheels are normal blur  u need circular blur,btohqsg
And if possible maybe the trees could be blured maybe at a 90Â°angle rather thn upwards like the road,btohqsg
