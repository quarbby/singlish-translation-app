any gurus here got tips on hitting scb smart card $500 eligible spend for signup gift?,btohqsg
and isit $500 spend on anything retail / online or $500 spend on qualifying transactions only (public transport/ fast good etc)?,btohqsg
Just buy vouchers that you will eventually use would be a good way.Courts  Kinokuniya  Fairprice  Cold Storage etc. a lot of vouchers can be found on HeyMaxHeyMax uses 5311 MCC which codes as Departmental Store so it will count as retail purchases.,btohqsg

Question regarding UOB GIRO. My due date is 22-Oct and I partially paid manually. Does this line above mean my GIRO won‚Äôt be triggered on 21st?,btohqsg
Means it triggered. But not sure if they take statement amount or current outstanding amount when they trigger.,btohqsg
Usually when I don‚Äôt pay manually it shows the full amount. But now shows 0,btohqsg
It is always 0 before post date,btohqsg
It is always 0. This is trigger not the actual payment.,btohqsg
hi there! need some advice regarding credit cards. Currently have a UOB One account paired w a UOB One credit card but UOB has nerfed their interest rates for the savings account so it doesn't bring me much value anymore. There are some months where I can't hit the min spend as well.Any recommendations for higher interest savings account + a no frills credit card strategy? No preference for cashback or milesThanks!,btohqsg
For giro  it will take remaining balance. Unless cc bank sent info wrongly,btohqsg
For Citi card  it will take the amount printed on the statement.,btohqsg
Depends how early you paid manually.,btohqsg
So actual payment or deduction will happen on 21st?,btohqsg
Hi guru  Why gold price so up these days. It may increase further?,btohqsg

May have been asked before. Best card(s) for GrabPay topup of large amounts?,btohqsg
Only card that still rewards is UOB Absolute (0.3%),btohqsg
Thanks both! For the credit cards wise  should i consider cards like UOB prestige platinum / Citi Rewards for the miles? Or if cashback then citibank cashback+?,btohqsg
UOB prestige platinum is prob a upcoming premium card to disrupt the market ü§£,btohqsg
