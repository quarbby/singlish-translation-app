I've convinced myself that there aren't any deloreans in sg,btohqsg
I saw 2 in japan already,btohqsg
Is just they are owners who don‚Äôt go out if ykwim,btohqsg
We also unfortunately regret to mention that due to some backend issues the stickers aren't waterproof and will start to fade. This isn't by design and is a production error and we apologise.Please message us with a photo of the sticker and we will replace it at the next meet FOC.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not trying to be funny. I am actually wondering  and if it‚Äôs available for daily use.,btohqsg
Lowkey feeling like the csgo stickers when u scratch them,btohqsg
I'm just going back japan then find the arasaka delorean again,btohqsg
So u can‚Äôt use a f1 car in sg cause of the specs and everything  but u can own it as a collection from auctions,btohqsg

everyone here spon $1 can help her buy dk how many airpod pro liao,btohqsg
dunnit hear her yap abt shet she dl,btohqsg
the only thing is they talk abt useless things and trynna make it big,btohqsg
i saying my opinion and thoughts ah,btohqsg
den when no one cares they act all hurt and shet,btohqsg
they want their opinion to rule the community,btohqsg
tbh its them and the people who stand by them against the rest,btohqsg
the rest will also hv the majority bro,btohqsg
let them talk cock act cock then ltr they will know they are wrong,btohqsg
its straits times  it gets published on the paper when some clowns write in,btohqsg
not sure if every forum letter appears on print but last i checked it did,btohqsg
but forum is for people writing in  these people are not employed by straits times. its just that straits times publishes their opinion when they write in,btohqsg
bro they nthing else to post meh,btohqsg
they know exactly what the fuck they are doing,btohqsg
why started printing out some random karens opinion,btohqsg
for every letter that gets chosen to get printed  they reject like 1000,btohqsg
so straits times  being the garbage organisation full of dumbfucks that it is  chooses its narrative by selecting the letters they like the best. And if you fuck them back  they will just tell you 'oh thats not my opinion  thats just his opinion',btohqsg
i know yall are kids but,btohqsg
if you don‚Äôt know how certain media work  pls refrain from commenting till so siao onz,btohqsg
to take offense is one thing  but are any of you going to go reply back to her w a valid argument?,btohqsg
i‚Äôm ok if you have a problem with somethingbut you don‚Äôt talk so openly about it if you don‚Äôt have any form of solution  it‚Äôs just unneccesary noise to me &/orto a community,btohqsg
BTW I am reserving judgement on the content of the letter. The only firm opinion i have is that ST is a garbage organisation full of garbage people. Personally I hate pops and bangs but I also respect the right for people to do what they want when not on public roads. So there are pros and cons to the letter,btohqsg
mehh ST is good for what it isSG media coverage is subpar anyways,btohqsg
very good to bungkus my nasi lemak and pick up my dog's shit off the street  wholeheartedly agree,btohqsg

Btw 23-24 I might be going sepang. Following lyson turbo to spectate. Anyone wanna go,btohqsg
i prefer not to unless u stay near me,btohqsg
Anyone has any idea whats this about,btohqsg
And could an oil change fix it,btohqsg
Like my oil color is fucked rn,btohqsg
Ya cause from what i see of the parts u need to get  is most likely the oil isn‚Äôt going the speed it supposed too,btohqsg
Just came on when I was driving,btohqsg
U can try change ur oil and see got any diff or not,btohqsg
Is this a suggestion or sacarsm?,btohqsg
I still have this driving distance left. My fingers are crossed.,btohqsg
Your engine is not switching the variable cams properly because the solenoid is not moving when it is supposed to. It could be the solenoid failing or its not getting the message to switch cams (i think they sense oil pressure? Edit: solenoids have oil control valves which react to oil pressure and can fail also). Either way i think its safe to drive for a while  just that your cam timing may be off at certain rpms so it wont run well,btohqsg
Manufacturers dont design cam profiles that will fail the engine if the cams get stuck. It just wont run well until you get it sorted,btohqsg
The oil change idea is not a bad one..its the simplest cheapest method to try  otherwise it might be a bad solenoid or oil pressure sensor,btohqsg
no worries bro appreciate the helpp mannü§ôüèª,btohqsg
PSA change ur oil religiously everyon. Every 8k,btohqsg
I change 5k. I saw an interview with a nissan gtr engineer where he said oil breakdown occurs at 3k onwards,btohqsg
For our kind of stop start high temperature environment  it probably happens sooner,btohqsg
I drive old car still okay,btohqsg
My dad recommend get a transmission oil cooler,btohqsg
Most jap car don‚Äôt have it,btohqsg
