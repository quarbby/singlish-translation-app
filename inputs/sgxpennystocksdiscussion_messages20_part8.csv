medtec weekbaseline 102 supportingestimated ututn point 102supports daywc long term tgt 99cloud 95,btohqsg
Just share..from other post. Pls...I am not plagarising. I declare first üòÅSince many ppl here vested in Medtecs...this is the latest TA from Master Yuan,btohqsg
late comers to the glove industry will inevitably have some catching up to do. Most imptly must choose JV partner carefully  one which can add value such as having good contacts and reputation  ability to source for low-cost good labour in the foreign country...etc. Margins are so impt and burn-rate before the first $ of revenue comes in,btohqsg
Not hot air as many would like you to believe. They are in a advanced stage. Production slated to start by 2021 2nd quarter. This link has more info. At 17 cents not bad for medium term. Once factory is up price will look up as well.They are recruiting a MD with 20 years experience in glove industry.https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/aspen-to-build-factory-for-new-glove-business-names-md-for-unit%3famp,btohqsg
U forward can see the source got acknowledgement not plagiarizing,btohqsg
Anyway..just share share. Does this mean support @1.02? What is cloud 95? I only know cloud 9,btohqsg
High risk high return. 6 months later to start production. 9-12 months to see it appear in bottomlineProbably more candidates more proven to be vestedThe hot air could potentially give best returns as hot air rises. When bubble burst also more painful,btohqsg
How and wat is spam? Lol. I sua ku,btohqsg
From what master Yuan wrote  I deduce that he says MT u-turn up at 1.02....and got ichimoku cloud support at 95? Correct me if I am wrong. TA newbie here,btohqsg
Sure show me any low risk high return options. Will be glad to know.Risk vs return is a well known fact.,btohqsg
Thank you for your in depth info.,btohqsg
Thank u kit.By the way. If you have time can share your view on keppel.I am your avid fan.  ‚úåÔ∏è,btohqsg
MT and gloves (except Tg) kana whacked badly past 2 weeks. Hope for some sort of recovery this week.,btohqsg
@BuddyLeeMthe number they commit to produce is questionable. Other establishment firm aldy say lack of supply.,btohqsg
Not sure the point of your reply,btohqsg
So hard to understand ahK then skip it,btohqsg
On what basis? You have any comparative figures of a glove startup to show it is not possible? I am very interested to see.,btohqsg
Since u vested   my advice keep it on ur toes. ü§û,btohqsg
Keep it on toes sorry I don't understand. You mean be agile and watchful and have a exit plan? If so yes will do. Thanks. I guess to some extent every investment is the same. Always have a exit plan.,btohqsg
just invest / trade within one‚Äôs means ...or else when tide turns  emotions can cloud judgement,btohqsg
Dow don't look good. Safer to reduce your positions or stay sidelines for a little while.,btohqsg
agree  in fact both Dow and Nasdaq volatile nearer US elections which is unpredictable.,btohqsg
Tml which pennies will chiong? Afterall this grp is meant for pennies :),btohqsg

Yea bro  for sure . Unless people are ready and are able to hold them for a longer period of time. Otherwise best is to side lines this period üëç,btohqsg
Dow will open with big down gap,btohqsg
What does this refer to?Please adviseThanks,btohqsg
Dow is gonna revisit 26300-26600 range before deciding next direction,btohqsg
why bro? any bad news coming?,btohqsg
This is part of the chart I forwarded earlier - Medtecs,btohqsg
Sorry I no understand the chartsIs the chart indicate good or bad for medtecAny advise please,btohqsg
Not say good or bad... just a guide on where the price may possibly go.@1.02 - likely to u-turn to go up....this means based on last fri closing px of 1.07  may go down slightly to 1.02 before going up..95 - is supposedly the support.This is how I read it. Any other views?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs unclear at this point. Need to watch a few more sessions.Generally  1.02 looks good support  if break down  look out for 0.99.0.95 is quite critical,btohqsg
May not all happen in 1 day trade....just have to be mindful of the diff levels of support,btohqsg
does that low of 1.02 on Fri count as hit already? thanks,btohqsg
yes then the bounce before close,btohqsg
Got to observe closely already.If you holding at high price then don't matter but if you wish to enter better wait out,btohqsg
Is not a good sign atm,btohqsg
Good question  bro but sorry  i no TA expert also. Dont wish to misguide anyone. I am just deciphering from the message given.,btohqsg
Join in if u put vid of yourself dancing the shopee dance,btohqsg
Imo  I think can expect more whipsaws ahead....just hope sentiment can stabilise,btohqsg
