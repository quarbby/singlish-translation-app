I rather be rich and happy than happy and poor,btohqsg
there aint no legacy if you dont become one someone else will take over you,btohqsg
I probably know him personally and could argue that you’re nowhere even remotely within the considerable league to even have the honour of being compared to him  not to mention be his own pushing competition to challenge himself there.,btohqsg
I only care abt my family,btohqsg
I'm gonna make the comp sci people redundant,btohqsg
I hv to say it takes a certain lvl of character to wish to do good and actually work hard 2wards it ah,btohqsg
And it usually takes a certain lvl of affluence for ppl to say that,btohqsg
I didn’t know that trying your best means that it looks like slacking off and procrastinating actually studying  which is what you routinely do  apparently.,btohqsg
Most ppl i know who wish to spend their lives helping ppl come frm comfortable backgrounds,btohqsg
Like you saved a life. That you changed someone else’s life.,btohqsg
The most help I'm offering to people is discovering more about the world lol,btohqsg
And hoping to implement it into something tangible,btohqsg
For me the point of life is for myself to experience all good the world has to offer,btohqsg
so different from those typical stories we see on shows lol,btohqsg
but they sacrifice their sanity and years of their life for it,btohqsg
and I aint gonna do that,btohqsg
Then at least you can say that you gave it your best shot. That you didn’t lose. Because the only way to lose is to have not bothered to fight. And the only way to win is to go down fighting  even when the odds seem impossible.,btohqsg
But it does take a lot of hardwork and drive whuch i admit i do not hv,btohqsg
My MAs have. I’m usually that someone.,btohqsg
...dont do this unless last resort,btohqsg
Not every thing is a fight to the death,btohqsg
Try to win b4 the fight,btohqsg
If you “insanely respect” them  as you claim that you supposedly do  then make an effort to make a difference. Make it easier for those working in the healthcare system  not exacerbate the issue further by burdening it.,btohqsg
Eh its applicable to alot of things,btohqsg
I was just saying i would nvr go there,btohqsg
And the way to do that is from the ground up on the inside.,btohqsg
Different ppl hv different goals in life,btohqsg
Neither are you helping the situation  which is contributing to the issue. You have access to the resources to unlock every opportunity for yourself to help  but instead? You’d rather procrastinate studying.,btohqsg
what do you want me do sia,btohqsg
Healthcare professionals do have that  its just a matter of how badly you want to prioritise having it. And what you consider to be your relatively acceptable definition of it.,btohqsg
But joel u wan med meh,btohqsg
And u wan med also isit,btohqsg
Ngl I kind of got lost in this conversation a while back,btohqsg
But dr is the most infamous one yes,btohqsg
Most of my job prospect is like this,btohqsg
Or  we could at least try to go down fighting to make it better.,btohqsg
I am done studying for today,btohqsg
I can’t tell who you’re speaking to,btohqsg
I mean he str8 up doesnt want healthcare tho,btohqsg
If imma gnna spend so much time on work,btohqsg
Might as well rake in big bucks,btohqsg
My lesser goal would basically let me live very comfortably but never rich,btohqsg
Unless my bigger goal works out very well,btohqsg
I wanted to be a pshychologist when I was young,btohqsg
its about my childhood aspiration bro,btohqsg
Im more of a sleazy wall street guy than a sleazy mother basement guy,btohqsg
EH WRONG   MINE IS PNS OCC,btohqsg
Experienced ones in Singapore is so difficult to find.,btohqsg
Psych is one of those fields where if you want a job actually in the field  Bachelor's isn't enough,btohqsg
