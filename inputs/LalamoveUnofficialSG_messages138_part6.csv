Ahhhh no wonder. It’s about $10 more.It’s just ridiculous that they deem it’s ok that a bicycle with a scooter and 3 pax can fit into a MPV.,btohqsg
Or they’re hoping that a desperate van driver sees the order and takes it up. Which I believe happened.,btohqsg
That’s the same that they book for a bike price but hoping for a car to pick up. That’s how cheapos like this think.,btohqsg
