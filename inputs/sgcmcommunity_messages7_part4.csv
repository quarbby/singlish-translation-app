great choice. i started with mazda 3 and i liked it. but i dont like the speedo with digital tach. and when i saw the 6 there is no turning back,btohqsg
Even the current one  I also bought at good price,btohqsg
mazda. not sought after. great. keep prices low. but it is a fantastic good car.,btohqsg
Ur hud is the flip up one or the windscreen type,btohqsg
flip up type HUD. but the latest 3 has the screen type. damn posh,btohqsg
Yes.. u will love the windscreen kind,btohqsg
And mazda is still produced in Japan,btohqsg
yeah the flip type is not so good. old model,btohqsg
do you know website to check chassis number of mazda,btohqsg
this is autonomous driving mazda lane following,btohqsg
the fuel economy i cant believe it. more than 800km,btohqsg
no. this is lane departure warning with hands off. i drive without hands.,btohqsg
"it lets me do this for roughly 30 seconds. and then warn me of ""Please hold your steering wheel"" warning and then disables it",btohqsg
so whenver it veers to the lane markings it will auto correct to stay in lane,btohqsg
i like the fuel economy with istop,btohqsg
damn good getting 13 km/l to 14,btohqsg
A lot of mazda owners do not like it,btohqsg
For me… i just leave it… but I never depress my brake fully… so seldom activate it,btohqsg
i know. it is made for us to use. why disable it thnking it will be bad for starters,btohqsg
it is like when wifi is there turning it on will shorten the life of battery kind of logic,btohqsg
i do that too. when traffic stop longer i press fully brake to stop engine,btohqsg
"https://youtu.be/76xUE9T3fOMsee conclusion -  reviewer says ""mazda 3 wins hands down""",btohqsg
mazda even the smallest 2 is fun. no CVT.https://youtu.be/Fcpvxtkgojs,btohqsg
Isn't coe already capped in terms of number available. Sales won't drop  just go to the highest bidder,btohqsg
Maybe the demand will drop since it would be cheaper to take grab/taxi than owning a car ..,btohqsg
Ya but obviously less coe less sales think that's what the author is saying,btohqsg
Salesman eat grass. Better pivot be 2nd hand car salesman  customers all there,btohqsg
They say Less Registration lor. They just have to increase the COE more until only maybe Ministers can afford so it will drop to all time low as well LOL,btohqsg
less new sales = more ppl paying pqp to renew coe lo,btohqsg
I went showroom last Saturday  so empty as compare to previously,btohqsg
Toyota sales person told my friend that she zero sales for 2 months already ..,btohqsg
It is those PHV companies that are pushing up prices. Individual buyers will have to think twice about car purchases for the time being.,btohqsg
Those PIs offering those 0% DP and PHV schemes,btohqsg
Ad also price too high la,btohqsg
I believe COE system could be more transparent like highlighting the names of those who bid. That could be more convincing,btohqsg
What the point when goverment already wanted car lite society   and now with ev arf rebate they will need cover some how some where,btohqsg
Grab also increase in prices taxi also,btohqsg
Bus and MRT as well also increased. But they say Fuel Tax is to subsidised all these,btohqsg
Toyota zero sales is get ready to pack Liao,btohqsg
"ofc... that's the ultimate goal lah. Essentially  they are increasing the entry to barrier to own vehicles. I mean... one of the contributors are private car dealers. If the dealers want to play their game legally well i.e. according to MAS' guidelines  dealers can choose to remove zero down payment schemes thereby making ppl consider the financial upfront costs more when considering cars procurement. Let's face it  even myself gets tempted when i see car promos that say ""zero DP""It's just a workable hypothesis so pls dont hit me haha",btohqsg
But Beware….. really must ge careful of PIs,btohqsg
Nowadays ppl getting smarter and smarter   they will always look like for the best deal .,btohqsg
1) maybe the cars not here yet so not registered yet…2) all COEs taken right? So A no sales means customers at B?,btohqsg
Gg I hope these salespeople don't have 1 month notice and can fl,btohqsg
FL? Salesman pay less than 1k right?,btohqsg
If they poot them  will they get the Comm from the previous sales? Maybe those 2-3 months ago,btohqsg
0% down payment is actually very lucrative for the car dealer   as buyer is paying 10 years of high interest.,btohqsg
Yup  that’s why I’m saying it’s a loophole.,btohqsg
Ask any car dealer they wish every 1 buy using 0 dp and 10 years loan so they can have maximum return of referral,btohqsg
Agreed think that's attractive during low interest scenarios,btohqsg
