hi guys isit allowed to send my lazada link here….,btohqsg
They are training you to be a independent thinker.,btohqsg
anybody wna help a G out pm?,btohqsg
But I heard from them can,btohqsg
I heard from sajc.confessions in ig,btohqsg
They got bridging module.and this person say got take bringing module,btohqsg
But it’s a sch confession page,btohqsg
And taking A math doesn't really help you in h2 math. Yes you apply your A math stuff in h2 math. Like product rule quoient rule. But to do very well for h2 math. Is not about practising anymore.,btohqsg
still the Provence isnt thr \,btohqsg
Is h2 maths important? Like is not having h2 physics enough,btohqsg
This iis how i feel tbh,btohqsg
throwback to crying over struggling to do 2 math questions,btohqsg
Yea I wld rather drop physics,btohqsg
throwback to completing 3 math questions in 1 day,btohqsg
But I feel they overlap alot in the courses,btohqsg
I must be damn shit then haha,btohqsg
i still rmb a few days before h2 maths As last year,btohqsg
i was struggling to do the simplest of questions,btohqsg
What make h2 math difficult is the application question,btohqsg
that was exactly where i got stuck at,btohqsg
But stats help to pull up marks a lot,btohqsg
In general I see graphs I pain,btohqsg
Given u dont screw up any parts,btohqsg
Reading this makes me question why I went jc again,btohqsg
I feel like u gonna tell me it gets worse,btohqsg
Yea hope so since I no need take h1mt anymore haha,btohqsg
my teacher once told me i was gonna fail GP As,btohqsg
U dont need good english to do well in gp...well to a certsinextent,btohqsg
I will definitely fail my GP,btohqsg
I think that's same for all years in sg education system,btohqsg
O level english oso no need good english,btohqsg
No leh  last time gp no need compre only do essay. Now with compre  u die die need english more,btohqsg
YeahAlthough both papers 1 and 2 are 35% each (I'm not sure if this percentage is still applied for current syllabus)  I think compre is more important than essayI also hate compre  but yeah  it's like that :(,btohqsg
My oni issue for compre is SAQ & summary  since theyre kinda focusing more on language  kinda like olvl english,btohqsg
I think AQ is useful in bringing up skills relevant to 'GP'  but i think theres more ways to do so as well in compre,btohqsg
And to add onEven if you think English is not important  better work hard for English  otherwise you will be suffering when you're in poly or uni,btohqsg
Is it cuz of the report writing / presentation etc?,btohqsg
Oh yah.. Presentation   you need to speak clearly,btohqsg
And there are many courses required students to take Communication module  which involves English Language. If you're weak in English  you will be suffering with this module very badly,btohqsg
If your English is not so good   can use Grammarly to improve,btohqsg
Yep canHowever  if you have to take exam for your Communication module  cannot use grammarly at all  so try to understand the grammar that suggested by the Grammarly  and try not to rely too much when you're taking this module(I mean if you rely too much on Grammarly  you might be suffering on exam because you might get a sudden feeling on how to survive without Grammarly in exam and feel very stress about it),btohqsg
And sometimes you have to write a formal email to your lecturer for the important stuff,btohqsg
Ah. That too.. need to learn the formal format.,btohqsg
I only used it at the start. Thereafter I stopped.,btohqsg
Sorry to bother you all  may I check with you all on how to getv1=1.25m/s & v2=6.25m/s if not sure nvm thank you all for your time and kind attention! :),btohqsg
I see  thanks for the time and guidance! :),btohqsg
That’s 1 minute! See you next time!,btohqsg
Ok thanks for the time and help! :),btohqsg
I feel so sadNobody would answer my question :(Is there an alternative group that I could join and ask? Just in case that still nobody answers my question in that group,btohqsg
majority of SGexams talks about O lvls and A lvlsprobably because people in poly and uni all taking different subjects or something,btohqsg
