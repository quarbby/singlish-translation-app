Ultimately civic still a JDM.. honda just abit late.. 1980 1990s best JDMs mostly from Nissan..,btohqsg
Isn't a Fc civic erm... thai,btohqsg
and there is an american civic too...,btohqsg
I dont classify like yall until manufacture where lah😂😂 c badge only.,btohqsg
But thanks for letting me know fc civic is thai 🙏🙏,btohqsg
Bro they more atas than us,btohqsg
many people say accord euro r jdm,btohqsg
I mean jdm means japan domestic model. But i think now the minimum requirement i guess is manufactured in Japan,btohqsg
Can't be anything with a jap car badge is jdm,btohqsg
or at least start as a model specifically for japan or be sold in japan at least,btohqsg
I think Kei cars are the only true jdm now,btohqsg
"Yeah. Most now are ""world"" cars",btohqsg
there's more American domestic cars now compared to anything else,btohqsg
because a lot of their brands aren't very global anymore,btohqsg

And texts of you alerting them?,btohqsg
