Anyone here knows what's the B3 range for Biology (estimate),btohqsg
Then what’s the difference with emath gosh,btohqsg
As part of MOE’s year-long engagement series  “A World Beyond School”  MOE Communications and Engagement Group has held two Facebook live sessions titled “Insights into the World Beyond School”. These live sessions are interactive and conversational  and focuses on how the future of work could look like  and how MOE can support youth to develop values  attitudes  mindsets and competencies (i.e. 21st Century Competencies) to thrive in the changing work landscape.During these sessions  MOE invites panellists such as industry professionals  parents and youths to share their experiences and discuss how the future of work could look like and how skills and dispositions required of students could be developed. Viewers may pose live questions via comments.In the upcoming session  on 7 November 2023 (Tuesday) from 8pm to 9pm the panel will be sharing how strengths and interests might shape our career choices  the transferable skills employers look for and what resilience might look like at work.,btohqsg
"The panel will consist of:- Trisha Suresh  Head of Public Policy and Economic Graph  LinkedIn SEA and Steering Committee at Mentoring SG- Derrick Lee  Co-Founder and CTO of Accredify- Serene Sim  Youth Wellness Coach  Joules Affinity and PSG LeaderShould you have any questions for the panellists  share them on the events page and click on the ""Interested"" button to get updates of the event!https://go.gov.sg/awbs-nov5",btohqsg
long ended when he talked abt CS with wrong info to a person in CS i just wanted the neko laoda to finish it off,btohqsg
im not even supposed to be part of Ambulance crew,btohqsg
Im very well aware of this part... but like i mentioned world creation..you are basically creating a world where your own physical self can't live in.As you said  you can use it to detect/categorise/predict etc...but its all based on patterns and algorithms...For a topic i literally have no interest in...I actually somehow have done the most notes when i learn about computers,btohqsg
understanable...I dont claim i know  its a simple statement whether factual or not,btohqsg
so if thats the case where its a topic you have no interest in then wouldnt that suggest you shouldnt be categorising everything to just VR and world creation  cancer detection  categorisation and prediction do not always narrow down into the VR / world creation. ML/AI works in this current day and age   without VR  its used to aid people to do tasks more efficiently  not to create a new world.,btohqsg
my general understanding is simple  why would you want to aid in doing task more efficiently if you were already happy with how the current world is.It only means you are not happy with the current world,btohqsg
im intrested to know how you have not realise this is what my mindset is,btohqsg
"still doesnt explain your generic statement that cs is all about VR/AR before i asked you ""are you sure""",btohqsg
they dont and im fully well aware..but like i mentioned before my parents literally have the same thinking as me,btohqsg
considering how you have this mindset  explains how you manage to find ways to get people to be pissed off about the way you converse,btohqsg
im just being realistic..i dont have to be a people pleaser.,btohqsg
its not the fact of being a people pleaser lol,btohqsg
You know very well yourself..progress have limitations and with the way this new wave of new technology that its starting to do more harm than good.,btohqsg
dont worry  we will see who gets to see the year 2100 first,btohqsg
"you give statements like""i mean yea...i think its to do with ar/vr tho""""Yea but it’s all in the virtual reality and world creation front""and expect people to take it at face value when CS is more than what you stated. you base it off what you learn instead of condering what all CS students learn  and before stating youre not a CS student  its pretty obvious what we are learning is not all surrounding AR/VR  CS consists of web development  app development  algorithm making  game making  AI that consists of ML  DL etc  and your ""well known"" VR. if you stated that its a sub-section of what CS entails  fine  you wont have 2 CS degree students coming ""up your ass""  well not really coming ""up your ass"" because if we really was that willing to  we would go more indepth",btohqsg
If i wanted people to take it and actually believed what i said..i would go to tiktok  i would go to twitter..I wont be saying all these here,btohqsg
being dead inside is no different,btohqsg
so you expect us to let you go with that narrative and show all the other people viewing that message who may be looking at this chat for people who are in the field to give insights to what their possible options would be,btohqsg
did you not see the reaction  someone was questioning it...,btohqsg
im done talking i have my ans,btohqsg
nah the shame will not fall on me...i wont ever have any say in the world...if anything you will,btohqsg
i’m literally in a research seminar rn,btohqsg
to someone who generalises everything CS to VR and world creation,btohqsg
to a 2 CS students  me and the neko laoda,btohqsg
omg u study comp sci ah,btohqsg
Yall are students for a reason..Im a student for a reason. But at the end of the day  learning never stops. You never heard of that?,btohqsg
apologies to everyone else for my swearing,btohqsg
like it or not  i will learn something...as what kuro said about progress,btohqsg
look around you  there is already resistance in the learning of augmented reality and applications...already resistance in the use of pervasive and immersive technology to aid in everyday life,btohqsg
the maturity yall have astounds me,btohqsg
the fact we give you examples to how CS is NOT only about VR and you continuing to twist it into a god damn society where everything has to be all about world changing and VR is suggesting youre not learning  you have a god damn skewed view of society based on what youre learning great. do i hate VR absolutely not  i think thats a world of its own but in no way everything a subset of VR and world creation. if thats true  then we shouldnt call it computer science  we should call it the world of VR. VR is a specific subset to the whole of CS. so is AI  so is web development. things work in harmony is the statement  not everything surrounds VR and world creation.youre learning? i think talking to a wall is less infuriating than you because at least they absorb the words and dont go twisting it into the same narrativematurity? then fine  take a CS course.,btohqsg
it astounds me for a reason...,btohqsg
the one thing you really need to learn is to form coherent discussion points and statements,btohqsg
like forget all your actual logic,btohqsg
the amount of hoops i need to jump through to even see what you’re talking about,btohqsg
what is there to discuss? Progress is limited...Everything has a limit...,btohqsg
not like about 50 years ago..some people decided it would be astronomically fantastic to mix chemsitry and physics together and end the whole world..But why did it stop? cause there was a limit,btohqsg
i think discussing this is 10x better than talking to said person,btohqsg
"time to change this gc name to ""subject matter expert""",btohqsg
ok you’re gonna bring physics into this …,btohqsg
chemistry is literally and i mean literally based on physics. the so called mixing is still ongoing right now everywhere.,btohqsg
u vroom vroom car off the bridge la,btohqsg
Yes but  why did humans all collectively decided that it was a bad idea to continue mixing explosive yield of physics and chemical combustion of chemistry together?,btohqsg
that doesn’t halt the progress of the field,btohqsg
do you see people testing nuclear bombs?,btohqsg
ill rephrase it  do you see people testing nuclear bombs on civillians,btohqsg
