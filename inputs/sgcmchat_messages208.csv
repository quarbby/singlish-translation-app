1. On behalf of itashasg  Congrats on 10k2. We took an hard L after the meet üò≠ üõí3. See u at the next one üòò,btohqsg
Quick question and I really need help with this  does anyone know any manual driving instructors ?,btohqsg
That is good at their job not half way done type shi,btohqsg
Just press clutch and move the stick to the number,btohqsg
Personally I think is not about the instructor but u need to be daring,btohqsg
Last time my instructor nv really do must he only let me drive around with his car and some tips on the course in side the circuit,btohqsg
Long long time ago 1 time pass,btohqsg
yeah i was abt to ask u this,btohqsg
in general don‚Äôt go for private instructors in this climate,btohqsg
++ wait times are absolutely horrendous for private now,btohqsg
last i heard was 4 mths tp test,btohqsg
If not wrong for private class the lesson 1 u can already book ur tp exam,btohqsg
Then u pick up the learning while waiting for tp,btohqsg
Cause my was like this last time,btohqsg
u still need to clear 5 prac  before mandatory sim(s),btohqsg
After FTT I book the exam liao,btohqsg
Ask the instructor clear u on paper 5 prac lor,btohqsg
either way private failure rate is so high  it‚Äôs funny when i see private students failesp those who were already advised to go sch,btohqsg
lol not all instructors are like that,btohqsg
Ask first before u confirmed the instructor,btohqsg
For private instructor u need to nego the price and condition first before u take him or her ma,btohqsg
So if let's say he agree to ur condition  u book tp exam (4mth) I think is good enough for u to clear the learning given 1 week 1 class,btohqsg
so total is like $1.8k lmfao,btohqsg
not incl theory or enrolment fee,btohqsg
If u good 3 weeks 1 class also same,btohqsg
This feller talkin got license or not,btohqsg
even w less practise  you spend roughly the same amount as i did at schooland then you are more likely to fail,btohqsg
it defeats the point of learning as a whole lol,btohqsg
there‚Äôs no such thing as a fast license  when you‚Äôre there to learn to drive safely & responsibly,btohqsg
Either way sch or private is up to the learner to decide,btohqsg
huh? what u talking about bro,btohqsg
i failed 3 times as private,btohqsg
Take license slow and steady also outside drive like kkj no use bro,btohqsg
All depends on your skill as a driver  some take to it like duck to water that‚Äôs why easy,btohqsg
lol sorry but tp test don‚Äôt test skill,btohqsg
I also same like@Kenpachi3  aft first prac book TP aldy  but 11 yrs ago lol,btohqsg
really js safety & their syllabus. u can be the fastest driver on sepang and still fail,btohqsg
Technically  not hitting kerb  constant checking of blindspot  not looking like a nervous wreck  all a test of your mettle,btohqsg
Skills on Sepang ‚â† skill for daily driving,btohqsg
nvr really put that as a concern or advised anyone about this lol,btohqsg
because u shldnt hit kerb  check blindspot constantly or be nervous if u actually went for ur lessons lol,btohqsg
one of the grp admins here took tp 3 times,btohqsg
he has been driving in msia for over 6 years,btohqsg
Ppl still hit kerbs regardless during TP,btohqsg
but still fail 3 times lol,btohqsg
Drive so long also doesn‚Äôt mean good driver lol what you on,btohqsg
simple as making a mistake or js being unprepared :),btohqsg
but u said bring a duck to water nia,btohqsg
i‚Äôm giving you the shining example,btohqsg
all can be in their 50s,btohqsg
but i‚Äôm contradicting ur point lol,btohqsg
he drives well  he has massive experience,btohqsg
and still can fail tp 3 times,btohqsg
Emphasise on a single word  some,btohqsg
sure but still  tp doesnt test ur driving skill lol,btohqsg
only to use their method & their checklists for safety,btohqsg
Hitting kerb is poor judgement la,btohqsg
Alamak bro  don‚Äôt so dense le,btohqsg
Try take ur exam during lunch hrs at eunos road then u will know if need skill anot,btohqsg
But I think now no more than road,btohqsg
Nope  can‚Äôt ever be too prepared,btohqsg
u saying dense but u not reading what i have to say :),btohqsg
My was the one going to eunos mrt there then  u turn back to cdc,btohqsg
Like i said you keep moving goalpost trying to validate your point,btohqsg
i not moving goal post leh,btohqsg
But others point out against you,btohqsg
feels like this is the standard cdc route,btohqsg
u gave example and i contradict,btohqsg
One of the crazy one during lunch and after office hrs,btohqsg
why u being so dense bro?,btohqsg
Haha  laze. I got my license i happy. Y‚Äôall can enjoy,btohqsg
congrats on taking a funny example very seriously,btohqsg
The number of time u need to check blind spot is countless,btohqsg
i‚Äôm not angry or annoyed or anythingbut beats the point for you to throw in a discussion  but not being open to understanding  then being lazy hahaha lol,btohqsg
Cause i talking to a brick wall duh?,btohqsg
err. you mean‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre just voicing out your opinion but not hearing others out?it‚Äôs okay if you want to establish that too,btohqsg
Sure keep to your opinion  enjoy,btohqsg
either way u stay left lane only till u need to turn,btohqsg
i won‚Äôt really understand your agitation or your firmness on this topic but sure,btohqsg
sorry   i‚Äôm only 16 need to over prepare for my license,btohqsg
what are u talking about bro i check blindspot constantly to be safe,btohqsg
my bro this is why u need to go sch ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
you check blindspots when turning  changing lane & reversing (to cfm safety)you don‚Äôt need to check blindspot additional times unless there is a raised safety concern  like a cyclist/motorbike filtering thru traffic,btohqsg
ya i mean when im changing lane then i check ah not when i‚Äôm like chilling,btohqsg
priv don‚Äôt teach most students the fundamentals at all  thus the high failure rate & the reasons given alw damn funny one,btohqsg
normal la. one time only what,btohqsg
I drive in reverse to be safe so I‚Äôm always checking my blind spot,btohqsg
r u in sg or jap rn,btohqsg
I drive in reverse to utilise my rear view camera,btohqsg
on the brighter side of things  let‚Äôs move the topic,btohqsg
what‚Äôs yalls favourite cars from Wangan Midnight?,btohqsg
i just found out there‚Äôs a Mercedes Benz SL that‚Äôs really pretty. Never really watched the show till end,btohqsg
i thought this was my friends prev unit at first,btohqsg
but i‚Äôve heard people taking school many times and failing though,btohqsg
i mean i get you passed on your first try ah but it think there are examples for both cases,btohqsg
so far from my current events,btohqsg
i just had two failures on sch side,btohqsg
majority of the reasons is nervousness actually  compared to private which is usually‚Ä¶‚Äúi didn‚Äôt learn this with my pdi‚Äù‚Äúi made this mistake because‚Ä¶‚Äù,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt look at nervousness because the most u can do is motivate & calm down someonebut if really error because of theory or execution  for school wise i‚Äôve only gotten this feedback because they rushed their lessons. Or  missed out on something during their lessons,btohqsg
Yea bro just now I play ghost battle saw a 190E,btohqsg
Mb bruh thought is the game,btohqsg
anyone know if tonight mw got lambo meet,btohqsg
