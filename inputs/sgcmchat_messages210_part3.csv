You need to be an admin to do this.,btohqsg
I'm on Instagram as@asashootshimself. Install the app to follow my photos and videos.https://www.instagram.com/invites/contact/?igsh=1p816dhwdqb05&utm_content=w1b2sjg,btohqsg
At this point I just created a new account,btohqsg
errm? bro that‚Äôs a very bad idea in the first place. there are other plastics capable of doing so?,btohqsg
i dun think u understood the qn but thanks for the answer üôèüèª,btohqsg
Okay as a start I recall in the early lancer forums someone made this,btohqsg
Basically it‚Äôs closed cell foam. Tahan +116 degrees,btohqsg
In theory  most closed cell foams should work la. Even rock wool. But I prefer the foams,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt recommend 3d printing it  esp pla cos it‚Äôs biodegradable and it WILL degrade in your car. Turns into a gummy mess. ABS  maybe but likely will deform into spaghetti and eaten up by your turbo. Other ways u can try is thin aluminium sheeting? But those are a bitch to cut.,btohqsg
Aluminium sheeting increases heat and reduces performance,btohqsg
i‚Äôm finding a way to drop the air temp around the intake. if not i‚Äôll proceed with a short ram,btohqsg
why would anyone try to use PLA ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Just think about the average intelligence of the average person in singapore,btohqsg
And realise that‚Ä¶ half of our population is below that,btohqsg
just look at how the average singaporean takes care of their cars,btohqsg
"""huh i thought tyre can last forever one""",btohqsg
using an older  stiffer + slick tire is saving fuel & grips the road better,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like F1 hard tyres üëçüèº,btohqsg
‚Äúif my tire don‚Äôt have much friction on the road  means i roll easier = save fuel‚Äù,btohqsg
a slick way to meet god,btohqsg
Shield wise is just aluminum sheet and reflective heat tape,btohqsg
cos nvan  tried put a cone filter on it..endup intake temp higher..stock is the way to go,btohqsg
there are good 3dprint materials with quite high heat tolerance but even still...the heat tape needs to be there..just that once u use high heat tolerant materials means harder to print  so ur 3dprinter at home might not tahan/not every place can anyhow print,btohqsg
as for what ive heard from my dad's friend is that he use 3dprint plastic can only last 1 week then dies fast,btohqsg
he said that he getting someone 3dprint in CF,btohqsg
just use 3dprint random plastic to mockup then cf printhttps://chemtron.com.sg/materials/continuous-fiber/3d-material-carbon-fiber,btohqsg
Saw this car at vivo city carpark yesterday,btohqsg
That should be the Ferrari roma right,btohqsg
Yeah I think if I‚Äôm not wrong,btohqsg
Lol. Home 3d printers can get up to 300¬∞c. U should look into PETG filament. It melts at 260¬∞c. PLA is abt 180¬∞c and engine gets to about 220¬∞c so u defo melt. Is not ur printer cannot tahan  is just wrong filament.,btohqsg
for most cars fine but uh,btohqsg
my dad's friend..obv keicar small engine bay so heat radiates like mad... already upgraded alot of cooling parts but still need more cooling...so that's why he felt that his 3dprint shroud not adequate enuf esp since hes making more power which is why he needs supporting mods(stock nvan slow asf.. horrible throttle response too),btohqsg
