I think I have above average IT skills,btohqsg
"Yeah I take it back. All my justifications for PHIL being ""useful"" are meritless.Ultimately  it depends on what you consider useful. What your value theory positions are.Some employers value logical thinking  thus will hire maths students  philosophy students  and everyone who demonstrates their capacity. Some employers value technical skills  aka doctors  lawyers  engineers  because the product or service is redundant without maintenance and development.No one is gonna guarantee that PHIL grads are gonna be paid well  if at all. After all  we're classified under the arts and humanities. And given the world trends  I might as well be paying 8k annually to eat grass.The subject matter we learn are highly specific  and sometimes transferable. If you value those skills  then yay.Plus  getting connections and gaining experiences far outweighs the piece of paper you receive post-grad.",btohqsg
But this is my egotistical side talking,btohqsg
i mean i went to check and that mofo has a phd in robotics right now lmao,btohqsg
OP ppl wont sign on :/,btohqsg
he finished NUS com sci  now he doing research on AI robotics,btohqsg

complain rng but score always 70-80,btohqsg
spend some time to read on the educational advantages provided to minorities ( blacks for usa  aboriginal for australia  non-han for china)  and then compare it to singapore. I personally think its bullshit and bad to have these provided  but its one side of the coin. you can take a look at that and decide for yourself,btohqsg
Anyone here in NTU sociology ?,btohqsg
"looking back in the chat history  quite a few ppl here simply say ""sg is meritocratic"" and then don't go further to think about what that actually means  and whether it's good or bad. just food for thought along with mooncake :)",btohqsg
Meritocracy in trying to isolate merit by treating ppl w fundamentally unequal bg as the same ignores and masks real adv and disav of diff segments of people… those w benefits alr had an adv and thus were further rewarded by meritocracy,btohqsg
If you need I can connect socio students with you,btohqsg
adding on to that with real examples  singapore believes that your race  gender  sexuality  and all hibbie jibbie stuff does not affect your performance (whereas other countries believe that being discriminated stunts your performance  hence they compensate it). An example would be china literally gives out extra grades to minorities for gaokao. Singapore does the complete opposite  throws everything out the window  and only stare at your grades. Singapore doesnt care if you are white  pink   blue  red  purple  brown  or identify as a fire fox. Both sides has its merits and grounds for consideration,btohqsg
"@tingfrogmaybe that would explain why meritocracy is thrown around like a ""good"" buzz word  but it is not essentially a good thing  depending on which part of the fence you are on",btohqsg
Yes please sir esp if they took HS2008 mod,btohqsg
one of my friends is NTU socio i can ask if he took it.,btohqsg
Hi  j wna ask if its legal for a company to dismiss u earlier than ur shift's end time on a working day but not honour the salary of the stated shift timings,btohqsg
As in for eg if ur scheduled to work till 5pm  supervisor realises they dn u for the day anym cos theres nth to do so they ask u to leave at 2pm. Is it allowed that they pay u up till 2pm or shld they pay u till 5pm?,btohqsg
Consider this in the circumstance that nth was stated in the contract regarding working hours that can be altered subject to discretion of higher ups,btohqsg
if your contract did not state any minimum daily working hours and no daily pay but only hourly pay there's nothing much you can do.,btohqsg
"need to see the contract  but agree with@TanJunWei. Employment Act s.9(1): ""A contract of service for a specified piece of work or for a specified period of time ... terminates when the work specified in the contract is completed""",btohqsg
do you have a contract about working hours?,btohqsg
the contract only stated minimum hours per week. but a week before  everyone's hours are rostered and fixed. unfortunately the manager likes to send ppl home 2-3h early frequently,btohqsg
despite it being disrespectful of my time  i j want to know if legal action can be taken 😂,btohqsg
its been a few months but i just need to clarify,btohqsg
it js said minimum 22 hours a week,btohqsg
dont think so  it can be considered a breach of contract at the most  and not of termination,btohqsg
can anything be done abt breach of contract?,btohqsg
and the hours im rostered for added up to arnd 35h a week,btohqsg
so with all the deductions it definitely still passed the 22h limit,btohqsg
probably have to view in context of singapore employment law  but in this case at the very most that you are compensated for the hours you were supposed to do; which would be pretty ridiculous to go to court to. i think its best you speak to your employer,btohqsg
and in this case no  they have met their contractual obligation,btohqsg
this is abt all the closure i need,btohqsg
honestly it didnt affect me that much and anw disrespect is impossible to fight for in court,btohqsg
and in the case i do get compensation  legal fees would exceed anyw so thanks for the clarifications everyone,btohqsg
use the legendary forbidden technique passed down from NS called lan lan suck thumb,btohqsg
Suck for 5 months alr. My thumb pain how?,btohqsg
suck thumb about pain sucking thumb  recurse it for all problems,btohqsg
welcome to the working world 😢,btohqsg
is a pretty reputable company so i will let them be ah,btohqsg
also i patronise them alot as a customer sooo,btohqsg
dw to get tangled up in bs js cos of an ugly hearted manager,btohqsg
my theory is that he/she doesnt even know that its upsetting his/her employees,btohqsg
she is sadistic  unfriendly  irresponsible and self-centered and wld do anything to upset me HAHA,btohqsg
you and your boss really starting to sound like a romance anime character introduction lmao,btohqsg
js putting it out here that on the last day she had a separate instruction for a certain task and didnt bother telling me  only told the full timer. then scolded me for not following the instruction and when i apologised and said nicely that i wasnt informed  she said she didnt inform me cos i was leaving the company anw,btohqsg
nvr inform then dont scold broand anyw even if im leaving the company v soon at that second im still working for them. so by right i must get the instruction too,btohqsg
ok bye i didnt expect this to turn to a rant HAHA i am someone who cares abt justice alot,btohqsg
Hi also yall got any bento cake reccs?,btohqsg

When the question gives a value for variance we should not find the unbiased population variance,btohqsg
If they say its a sample we need to find but if they say it follows normal distribution with variance,btohqsg
How to know if we need to find the unbiased population variance,btohqsg
Is anyone here studying pharmacy who have resources on cardvioascular and musculoskeletal system?,btohqsg
When is it too soon to save in cpf for housing,btohqsg
I'm thinking of throwing every cent in my fixed deposit into cpf,btohqsg
My goal is to buy one of those million dollars hdbs that are floating around,btohqsg
I want my future kids to go to either Nanyang,btohqsg
4 room HDB at the Nanyang girls there,btohqsg
There all high SES area mah,btohqsg
My mom's place at boon lay rn is 400-500k,btohqsg
Hdb prices everywhere is shooting up,btohqsg
I can pm u some notes  more for clinical dx  pe and mx if thats ok,btohqsg
Next year I go work at pizza hut gonna put every cent into cpf,btohqsg
Invest my whole salary into OA,btohqsg
Since my parents are paying for everything anyway,btohqsg
Might as well us this opportunity to build up my cpf,btohqsg
Unless they are doing a BTO near Nanyang or any elite schools,btohqsg
I want my future kids to get every advantage,btohqsg
Honestly ah  instead of thinking abt saving money u shld be thinking of how to ensure u urself do well,btohqsg
If u are successful u are bound to hv connections with ppl in high places and more means to ensure ur kids hv an advantage over their peers. This will help not only frm pri to jc/poly  but will be more impt when u trying to find internships/job opps in the future.,btohqsg
while it's a good start  it's not as advisable,btohqsg
but oa is still a stable source if you want,btohqsg
Har the 2km thing scrapped what,btohqsg
Hey guys do prelim results deviate alot fromd o level results ?,btohqsg
Like usally how close is the o level results and the prelim results,btohqsg
Also no one invests all their wealth into one basket. Abit ridiculous. 2.5% but 0 liquidity. By the time you're 55 your kids already working.,btohqsg
Depends on your school  I scored better in prelims coz that's just how my school standard is 🙄,btohqsg
rn I'm doing cyber security in sp,btohqsg
Hopefully I can get a job at FAANG,btohqsg
Not a bad course all things considered  if this is more than a burst of motivation u can start researching on possible paths you can take to get there,btohqsg
Like stalk highflyers in ur field on LinkedIn and take notes of how they got there  e.g. internship paths  competitions  relevant ccas etc etc,btohqsg
No leh I heard 1km rule still there what,btohqsg
I jumped 10+ points from 30+ to 20+,btohqsg
I ard 1-2 points diff only,btohqsg
What did u do in ite,btohqsg
I year 1 sem 1 bro,btohqsg
im sure some people here wldnt mind,btohqsg
i have exams this two wks,btohqsg
u shld go cyc discotd setver go ask,btohqsg
Idk if i filtered xss correctly,btohqsg
I hope can improve q abit or at least ard the same sia,btohqsg
yeah  to train AI to know how to recognize objects,btohqsg
fixed deposit already higher than OA,btohqsg
Not all tho and OA is more stable,btohqsg
if u want to lock up your cash  it's not OA now  but putting all into SA,btohqsg
your first 60k gets an additional 1%. Coupled with 4% for SA  you get 5% on your amount,btohqsg
However  you are exchanging time during youth for money.It's possible to increase other forms of knowledge so that your rate of earning increases.Use some maths. At $10/hr earnings  let's say u work 8hrs a day at 30 days a month. That's $2.4k monthly. But this $2.4k monthly stays at that rate if you remain status quo and do nothing else.Now  let's say you take the time instead to upgrade yourself in some useful knowledge. Let's say 5 years from now  you start out earning $4k monthly working 20 days a month. That's a $1.6k monthly difference. Assuming no promotion and status quo  you break even with a fixed 2.4k monthly after 7.5 years.In this scenario  the breakeven happens when you are only in your early thirties. The difference becomes significant in favour of the 2nd path when you hit your 50s.,btohqsg
Not just that  spending the time and effort also helps increase your rate of returns. OA is fixed at 2.5%. You mentioned you want to save for housing  so additional 1% does not apply as that would go into SA.With proper knowledge and risk management  it's not tough to hit a low returns of 4% or more to achieve your target with minimal risks. Plenty of people have done that over past many years  with higher rates at a safe way.,btohqsg
My objective of typing so much  I hope  is for you to look further ahead and think different from your current plan  to see more possibilities. 👍💪,btohqsg
My plan is really just to use my holiday work money for OA for housing XD,btohqsg
i'm planning to buy it once the fed announces the rates,btohqsg
eh but silver sounds good now,btohqsg
i mean buying the silver itself irl,btohqsg
not my area of reading or knowledge 🙊😢,btohqsg
me too  all i heard is some logic from somewhere on how inflation we can buy a lot more silver and when it deflates the price of silver still remains the same so we basically hedge against inflation that way,btohqsg
Regardless  a gain of 200% over a small capital still loses to a gain of 2% over a large amount of capital.And because this chat group is primarily students  that's why I mentioned to build your human capital for now.,btohqsg
There's a financial blogger whose dividend income is mid 5 figures monthly on an average  I guess  6% yield. Can search for ASSI.,btohqsg
I did forget to consider the minimum sum needed,btohqsg
For me  because of some other promotion  I managed to deposit within OCBC for 3.48%  but it's only for 1 year,btohqsg
at pizza hut  which was the plan?,btohqsg
Was advising Joshua  he mentioned working at pizza hut to save all into OA for future buying of HDB,btohqsg
idk i just invested my money instead,btohqsg
not worth for most  is just because of personal circumstances that I needed to take up the promotion. Liquidity is locked up.Singapore Savings Bonds are good enough generally.I also placed a little into Frasers Green bond just out  4.49%.Astrea bond  4.15%Low yield stuff but should be safe enough.,btohqsg
have to open cdp is it,btohqsg
ya i was searching online on how to buy in it,btohqsg
Can someone teach me how to use it?,btohqsg
hm that one idk  i still haven't open it,btohqsg
You need to be 18 yo min,btohqsg
Idk if you still need to go down to buona vista for it,btohqsg
As how to best utilise it  not how to open it,btohqsg
I have one linked to DBS Vickers,btohqsg
Can just go Mbs one also,btohqsg
Hi guys anyone has combined chemistry O level topical (2012-21) answers? pls pm me 😢,btohqsg
Omg how on earth do I stop the noise from the neighbours it’s very annoying there seems to be some discord call from below and I’m trying to study,btohqsg
Aight I’m very scared there’s someone tracking me on my phone,btohqsg
As I hear noises coming from my phone,btohqsg
Don't worry. You most likely are like me  don't have anything valuable for them to track.,btohqsg
wait is the noise from neighbours or phone?,btohqsg
SSB is the most popular  I think there's some websites that post about some recommended ones,btohqsg
i just do OCBC BCIP instead,btohqsg
i not working haha so no point put money in bcip,btohqsg
but may take a look at it!,btohqsg
not much loss. Max 9k only,btohqsg
if u are into SSBs  this month's Govt T Bills is 3.32% per annum  for 6 months. Just closed yesterday but they release each month like SSB. Difference is you don't know yield until after it's issued as it's a bidding system.,btohqsg
i read that t-bill is short-term,btohqsg
but i will keep a look out,btohqsg
the other ones locked for like 10 years or 6 months yikes,btohqsg
SSB not worth to keep for a month. The yield typically starts lower and rises as the years increase.6 months T Bills is a better alternative in that sense. In fact  you get the interest back first.,btohqsg
eg for the last T Bill  if 1k was put in  $16.80 would be returned. Then they return 1k at the end of 6 months,btohqsg
cannot 1 month la ssb HAHAHA 0 yield si,btohqsg
can if u have large sum of money,btohqsg
u put in a million u yield so much,btohqsg
if u have a million  it's no longer just SSBs,btohqsg
SSB max per NRIC is 200k,btohqsg
take an accounting module in uni,btohqsg
u took more than that to reach uni. Nothing wrong.,btohqsg
for more investment advice  you may register for my investment courseIt's a non existent course that will never be around and never be conducted.,btohqsg
You may join my investment telegram channel.But I also don't know the channel,btohqsg
if you like crypto  it's more worth it to start an exchange and release your own coins.,btohqsg
people just dump money at you,btohqsg
u put money in crypto uh?,btohqsg
I put about $0.00 for 20% yield into Anchor Protocol,btohqsg
Create a crypto and list the sell price at 2 million,btohqsg
The allotment is so pepega now coz it's so popular hahaahhaha,btohqsg
I don't like those that lock for long periods,btohqsg
Everyday i see you grinding on IG,btohqsg
its a good thing either way,btohqsg
are you aiming for overseas uni,btohqsg
come smu aka southwest methodist university,btohqsg
either way  don't go to CHS unless you want to become a full fledged social science slave,btohqsg
The exception is if it appeals to you,btohqsg
As a math major i literally spend more time on my non-math mods than math mods,btohqsg
Thats not smth u should be asking atm,btohqsg
Are u from geog / GL?,btohqsg
uhh nope not at the moment  but im doing the GL intro mod right now and still thinking whether i should major in GL or not,btohqsg
Oh ya anyone from biz and have fin2704 notes too,btohqsg
I thought CHS is Catholic High,btohqsg
College of Humanities and science I think,btohqsg
chs seems like the only place arts stream people can go😅,btohqsg
is it not a common college for fass and sch of sci or smt am unsure,btohqsg
just personal experience so far as a Y1 CHS man,btohqsg
i just find it ridiculous that i take more non-math mods than math mods  and these non-math mods take up most of my time kek,btohqsg
then i dont think you should be generalizing an extreme opinion for people,btohqsg
the two of you arent the only people in this chat...,btohqsg
that being said  im taking hss and hsa rn also  so i understand your grieviances haha,btohqsg
but hsa has been quite enjoyable for me so far,btohqsg
have you submitted the HSA indiv assignment,btohqsg
cutting my word count rn HAHA,btohqsg
i have way too much to write,btohqsg
yeah i had to exclude section i wanted to write if not it wouldn't fit,btohqsg
i remember telling my TA i wasnt confident i could hit minimum word count  then i started writing,btohqsg
honestly my essay is a mess and i didn't go very in depth,btohqsg
inb4 S/U three mods this sem,btohqsg

To go from a C6 (prelims) to A2 (O level) for Emath is redoing the yearly TYS under timed condition enough?,btohqsg
You also need to get the questions correct,btohqsg

How to do better for sbq 🥲,btohqsg
TYS? Look at how they infer and stuff.,btohqsg
Mostly just try to connect the topics tested with the source.Like if there's a source about Germany then obv it's about hitler,btohqsg
Ya but i did sm but still failed,btohqsg
Clarify with teacher what went wrong,btohqsg
Look at the teacher's model answer for the questions u have done,btohqsg
Although i usually understand where i went wrong and understand the model ans i still am not able to improve,btohqsg
Then just leave it as that? Sometimes there isn't much to do,btohqsg
Then I mean...you can also pm me? I'll try to explain to u anything u need help with,btohqsg

Posted on Behalf of CHATHello everyone! We are a group of CHAT ambassadors (under IMH) trying to understand more about the mental health beliefs  barriers  and facilitators that youths in Singapore face when trying to seek mental health support. The information collected from this ~10 mins survey would then help us in improving the accessibility of mental health to youths in Singapore like yourself.We are looking for youths from 16 to 20 years old to help us in this survey.We will be extremely grateful if you could kindly spare 10 minutes of your time to answer some questions. You would be asked questions about your personal mental health beliefs  and factors that discourage and encourages you to seek mental health support and suggestions for improvement.Your participation in this survey is completely voluntary and you have the right to withdraw from the survey at any time. Do also be rest assured that your information will be kept confidential and any personal information will be discarded after the research has been completed.Thank you and we really appreciate your help in this! ^^Link to survey:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3MmkYYNF9nh7jXkUcHHSs24diiYCFLH0HpYb7zw-wvG1hbQ/viewform,btohqsg

"Hey everyone  I took A levels last year and would like to share my tips in studying for H2 Geography :) I understand that everybody studies differently and what I find useful may not be so for you  so if you would like to share your own tips and advice in studying for the subject  feel free to add on in this thread!I'll be splitting this post into 2 segments: Exam Strategy and Studying Tips. Under Exam Strategy I would address how to tackle the Essay and DRQ components separately  as well as some things I suggest doing under certain scenarios. Under Studying Tips I would address (as the name suggests) how to plan your study schedule when preparing for your exams. I won't be able to provide help for specific content mastery though  since I haven't touched my lecture notes since end-November last year (oops)EXAM STRATEGYEssaysAlways go for quality over quantity. Your essays are meant to showcase your ability to think like a geographer: how you employ synoptic links  how you critically analyse and present your case  as well as your familiarity with content (which ties in with your use of synoptic links). As such  I would suggest going for  for instance  4 astutely argued body paragraphs rather than 6 mediocre ones.Write a good conclusion. This goes without saying  but I think conclusions play a very significant role in the Geography essays  to the point where  in a scenario whereby you only have 5 minutes left and are halfway through your last content paragraph  I would suggest forgoing your content paragraph and write your conclusion instead. If the question calls for it  and if you are able to do so under timed constraints  you can opt for writing more than 1 conclusion paragraph.But what is a good conclusion  and how do you write one? A good conclusion is one that allows you to demonstrate critical thinking and the ability to comfortably adopt multiple perspectives. Meaning to say  it should try to achieve balance with the topic  and this can be done through dissecting underlying factors and pre-causes of the problem presented in an essay. This is also a great opportunity to make synoptic links. There is no one templatised way to churn out a 'model conclusion'; it really depends on the question and your own way of adding insights to the topic.By ""adding insights""  I don't mean introducing new content which should have been in the body paragraph. Conclusions are meant to synthesize and balance  instead of elaboration on a new point.What on earth is a synoptic link  and how do I make it? As we all know  content for H2 Geography is split into 3 Themes  and tested separately in the Essay paper. Synoptic links happen when you employ concepts from another theme to elaborate on your answer. I would suggest going beyond namedropping concepts [e.g. namedropping the ITCZ (theme 1) in explaining water scarcity (theme 2) in BWh/Aw areas] and doing a bit more elaboration for 1-2 lines and briefly explain the subtropical high pressure belt can result in low rainfall and hence arid climates.Prepare your case studies  and use them well. It's okay to use a ""textbook"" example in Geog  since what the examiners want to see is the quality of the argument and how you use the example to elucidate your argument. What matters the most is how well you know your example  and by that I don't mean you need to memorise specific statistics  but how it fits your argument contextually. So folks plspls go and familiarise yourselves with case materials for dat [insert your desired grade]For most of us who read GP  we learn that the bulk of your explanation should come from your elaboration  and examples are used as a means to validate your explanation. Personally  some of my peers and juniors may face some issues for Geog as a result  since for Geog things aren't quite the same.",btohqsg
I believe that GP goes about testing how well you can argue  whereas Geog examiners would prefer seeing how you use your evidence to support your claim because they aren't testing you on how to argue  but more of what conclusion/inference you can derive from presented evidence. Ultimately  Geog is a social science  meaning that conclusions are derived from observing trends  which can only come from present evidence.,btohqsg
"Data-Response Questions (DRQ)For questions with lower order command words (e.g. ""describe"")  go for quantity over length. These questions don't require elaboration  so I would suggest directly describing it and leave more time for the higher order command words (e.g. ""explain"" ""comment"" ""account for"" ""recommend"" ""evaluate"")It may sometimes be hard to see what examiners want from these questions. Don't overthink; just pen down what you see  the answers can be super obvious sometimes [e.g. I remember seeing one DRQ question which asks you to describe the spatial distribution of the ""Hot Banana"" zone in western Europe  and one of the answers that carries a mark is literally ""it is shaped like a banana"". So don't think too hard.]Know your mark breakdown. How many marks each point carries  as well as how much elaboration should go with it  can be extremely helpful. [The following are general rules of thumb  examiners from Cambridge or your school can set questions that throw you off guard that may not be aligned with what is mentioned here  so exercise your own discretion and caution] There are some instances in which a 7 mark question is marked by points (i.e. the number of valid points determines how many marks you get)  and sometimes a 6 mark question can be marked by levels (i.e. the quality of your argument determines how many marks you get). To determine if that is the case  look at your command words: if it starts with ""explain/comment/account for"" etc  it's probably marked by points  and if it starts with ""evaluate/recommend"" or anything that requires you to provide a balanced argument with more than 1 side of the argument  it's most likely marked by levels. However  typically for point-marked questions  those with ""lower order"" command words like ""describe"" requires 1 point/mark  and command words like ""explain"" can carry 2 marks for 1 clearly-elaborated point.",btohqsg
