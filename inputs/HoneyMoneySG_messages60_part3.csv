which bank allows Paynow with transaction category?,btohqsg
"from uob web site  it says put transaction reference as ""PAYNOW SALA""",btohqsg
OCBC paynow has categories. Dbs I believe don‚Äôt have. U just go try yourself,btohqsg
UOB Credit card cashback or reward is based on your statement monthUOB one bonus interest with $500 qualified spend requirements is based on calendar monthsIf your credit card statement month is 19 Aug  you need to spend $500 from 20 Jul to 19 Aug to get cashback  n from 20 Aug to 19 Sep to get cashback on next statement month.To earn UOB one bonus interest(eg. 5%)  you must have $500 qualified spending between 01 Aug n 31 Aug on your credit card.Hope the above answer your question.,btohqsg
Oh OK then it's PAYNOW SALA. Thanks for the correction.Dbs paynow definitely cannotI don't use ocbc paynow so,btohqsg
As long as $500 in posting date for the month,btohqsg
Ocbc TR recurring telco payment count for $500 for account 360?,btohqsg
Hey guys  will my Citi Rewards cc be able to receive points on online spending that charges in foreign currency?,btohqsg
It should be by the 10th business day of the month.,btohqsg
Online spend should be ok  provided it isn‚Äôt one of the exclusions,btohqsg
"WOW. My feedback were based on my personal experience. As many users here are trying to get their so-called ""salary"" to be recognised by uob  I wanted to share to save you time and effort because I tried and failed. I called uob on the pretext of finding out more on how the salary credit portion works exactly. Of course  I did not sabo anyone here. Don't assume others are idiots when you do not know them. Anyway  it is best I don't share anymore. All the best. Happy National Day and thank you for your insightful comments.",btohqsg
First time I heard someone failed on Uob one account  not sure how you did,btohqsg
It‚Äôs not about sabo. The feedback on the ‚Äúloophole‚Äù may be passed back to their product mgrs and it may be closed in the future. Anyway  as stated earlier  u can easily check the status of your salary crediting via the tmrw app,btohqsg
Add on  salary crediting and spend status takes a few days to reflect. Not immediate,btohqsg
Add on :$500 spend requirement for month is computed monthly..This is based on the card's transaction POSTING date within the calendar month (1st to end of month),btohqsg
Activesg $ on activesg app or ns55 credit on lifesg?,btohqsg
Thanks. Perhaps you want to add the $500 requirements posted date on calendar month is for UOB credit card cashback or UOB one bonus interest. There are two different types of $500 requirements that UOB make people confuse. New UOB customer usually get confuse on this .,btohqsg
From what I understand there's a way to call uob for the card statement to start calendar mthEasier to calculate cashback for the card itself + check you hit 500 for uob one account,btohqsg
Not too sure  I don't use uob for Cashback üòÖ,btohqsg

Can ask what is the best way to convert currency for trading in moomoo or tiger? Do you guys convert currency via moomoo or tiger or convert elsewhere and transfer over? Asking mainly for usd and hkd.,btohqsg
Your question spark my curiosityJust did a quick comparison of 100 SGD to USDDBS Internet BankingMoomooTigerIBKRSurprised that DBS give me better rates,btohqsg
At larger numbers ibkr is better,btohqsg
Dbs has a spread of 0.7%.Ibkr charges 2dollar per transaction  but otherwise spread is better,btohqsg
My High Yield Cash Strategy after the GXS Bank NERFhttps://youtu.be/Dc3sQycHpkk,btohqsg
Terms & Conditions for 5.8% p.a. Guaranteed returns for both Moomoo Cash Plus and POEMS Smart Park also explained in this video.,btohqsg
Noted. Later I try $1000 and see got diff annot. Am using IBKR for DCA US index. If possible to save abit from fx,btohqsg
Yes i had been doing thr exchange at tiger and moomoo but the rate not ideal,btohqsg
Tiger rate is usually better than moomoo too,btohqsg
I don't think so because deduction from cpf is thereafter  if successful.,btohqsg
Hi  does anyone know the MCC of Courts? Whatcard and heymax gives a different answer,btohqsg
Just my own random experiment (getting the quotes from the different platform)DBS and IBKR comparable1k SgD changeMoomoo  739.68 uSDIBKR 742 USDDBS  742.08 USDTiger 740.68,btohqsg
If you compare Tiger vs Moomoo. Tiger better but both lose out to DBS and IBKR,btohqsg
"Need to transfer carefullyQ: Can Tiger deposit in US dollars directly?Yes  but please note that if you want to deposit in US dollars  please make sure that your funds are remitted from the bank in US dollars and the recipient bank account of Tiger is in US dollars also. (Many banks will have the option of "" receiving currency of recipient bank "" as you make remittance  please remember to check this option.)Some customers in Singapore reported that they remitted in USD  but actually received in SGD  which was probably caused by the fact that „ÄåUSD„Äç was not selected for the receiving currency of the bank during remittance operation.",btohqsg
David  how did this go? I'm thinking of doing the same to hit the 8k citi parallel promo...,btohqsg
Yup and dbs will lose out to ibkr the larger the amount above 1000,btohqsg
I dca every mth to ibkr so I compared before,btohqsg
How come your video says 100k for 5% under UOB one while the UOB website says 7.8%?,btohqsg
5% effective interest on entire 100k  7.8% is just marketing gimmick for the highest tier (last 25k),btohqsg
I‚Äôm kinda noob at this  base on this screenshot  how is the 5% worked out based on 100k?,btohqsg
Oh ya I can‚Äôt post a screenshot here.First $30k - 3.85%Next $30k - 3.90%Next $15k - 4.85%Next $25k - 7.80%,btohqsg
(0.3 * 3.85%) + (0.3 * 3.90%) + (0.15 * 4.85%) + (0.25 * 7.8%) = 5%,btohqsg
You don't even need to calculate it yourself  just click the (i) at the Total Interest on the UOB website and this thing will pop out,btohqsg
How unfortunate  if only it‚Äôs 7.8% on 100k üòÖ. But 5% still better than many other banks or FD. Basing on the % above 100K  I think not worth to deposit above 100K,btohqsg
