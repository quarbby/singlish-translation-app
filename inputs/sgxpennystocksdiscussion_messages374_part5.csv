40 healthcare workers in Malaysia who had both doses of vaccine test positive for COVID-19https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/covid-19-malaysia-healthcare-workers-infected-after-vaccination-14640550#.YHqSCmjVPNU.whatsapp,btohqsg

I heard that for those travellers who are quarantine at the hotels upon arrival there‚Äôs a certain hotel that is quite Jia lat and not very well cleaned up.,btohqsg
very bad at bukit timah area,btohqsg
And I tot my stocks make me lose track of time,btohqsg
time to play in the water n catch fish,btohqsg
Not surprising. Decontamination of a room is very tough and time consuming. The cleaners are specialists . In a hospital environment  chemical are use and cleaners are gowned in full PPE. Most important the air ventilation are guaranteed using clean air technology .I doubt this are possible in the hotel industries. Too much money involved.My personal view.,btohqsg
Letter surfaced from HK abt financial institution telling customer that it might need up to 95 days to pull money out.Anybody receive anything similiar recently?https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetsilver/comments/msmy8y/_/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share,btohqsg
In case we Toh...Seriously which financial institution will give such zero confidence statements,btohqsg
Idk. Will read further into the content that this dude post. The language sounds banksy enough but also agree that no bank would say stuff like that.,btohqsg
I guess sg FI squeaky clean so...Not happening here.,btohqsg
Yup. They never use short form. First two words already suspect.‚ÄúYou‚Äôll...‚Äù,btohqsg
R/wallstreetsilver already sounds bs enough lol,btohqsg
Sorry. I am a mere silverfoil hat and I thank this chat for having me here.I am not picking a fight.You are saying wallstreetsilver sounds bs because...?,btohqsg

Expecting volatility going into May. Think play pennies better than blue chips now.,btohqsg
"I also had some suspicions abt that. Went to dig some old aviva letters. Think they meant to say ""We are"" instead of ""We're"" in this example.",btohqsg
Walan..I read this really just give up,btohqsg
What local payLocal too exTake third world pay then competitive,btohqsg
Sua ah.. since there's a need to compete on an international field locally.. might as well go work in other countries that pay better,btohqsg
Saw this on the news earlier on..I was like ‚ÄúWHAT!?‚Äù ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Cannot sleep leh  weekend time short. Must make best use of it,btohqsg
Wah shiokkkkk!!!!!Making me hungry man!! ü§§ü§§,btohqsg
Weekend must sleep more....weekdays cannot sleep well because have US mkt of open,btohqsg
Hahahah still got effort to garnish,btohqsg
Just sounds like a forum similar to wallstreetbets to me  plus as some here have mentioned the language used in the letter doesn't look those used by formal organisations. I would advise to look into this matter closely if you've received the letter personally and clarify with your representative thereafter.. just my 2 cents,btohqsg
Agree .. hope tomorrow can up,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt see the reason for letting foreigners come in and bring up the infection rate?Unnecessary stressing of the front line staff.,btohqsg
Agree. So many foreigners especially from India.  Haizz.,btohqsg
No wonder some people calls Sg the next capital of India.,btohqsg
