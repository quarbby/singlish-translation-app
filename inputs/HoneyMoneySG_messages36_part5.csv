Hello  if I‚Äôm paying for wedding banquet venue fee via online payment link provided by the hotel  which MCC code is it categorized under? Will it be considered as qualified transactions under these few credit cards?-Citi Rewards-HSBC Revolution-DBS Altitude-Stand Chart SMART-UOB KrisflyerThanks!,btohqsg
if im not wrong it would be classified as Hotels Travel  so Citi Rewards would be out of the option.,btohqsg
thanks for clarifying! i just signed up for citi rewards  UOB krisflyer and SCB Smart via moneysmart promo  so trying to clock the min spend to earn the rewards üòÖ,btohqsg
if possible would be HSBC Revo up to $1k  but if the hotel is able to allow you make payment online i think DBS altiude able to clock 3mpd with it up to $5k,btohqsg
SC smart payment forNetflixD+Yakun Macdonald KFC etc onlySimplyGoCiti reward + Amaze would be good for your oversea expenses excluding flight and hotel or travel relatedi think left over would be absorb by UOB krisflyer if you made $800 worth of purchase with SIA group can get 3 mpd uncapped,btohqsg
thanks so much for all the info. So i guess the $500 min transaction for SCB Smart card needs to be under these transactions as well to earn the rewards? - Subscriptions/Breakfast Joints/Public transport?,btohqsg
technically the $500 just need be spending  you can charge the wedding onto it but it not optimised as yeah only those lifestyle stuffs reward you 6%,btohqsg
the rest is only 0.3% if im not wrong,btohqsg
OH i see!! Ok i got it now. Meaning for the sign-up reward just need to clock the minimum spend. But to optimize the cashback/miles reward then follow the guidance you mentioned above üôè,btohqsg
yeah correct  if they allow you to spilt the bill then it would be better. you can optimised your cards and soak up as many rewards point as possible.UOB Krisflyer is the best if you have already spend $800 on SIA group on that card than make payment for your wedding  as it the only uncapped 3 mpd card in the market,btohqsg
the rest have limitation  DBS altiude would be the second with a $5k cap monthly on Online Hotel transaction with 3mpd,btohqsg
wow thanks so much for the info it‚Äôs really useful!! appreciate it üôèüôè,btohqsg
Eh... Hotel travel and flight related don't count to the 4mpd citi rewards ah?,btohqsg

Hi all  if I use my CRMC and Citi payall for my education fees. Do I earn 4mpd?,btohqsg
Good morning! Can I check if instarem amaze can be linked to the OCBC Titanium Rewards credit card? I saw that they are having some sign up promotion right now. Is it worth to get the card too? üòÑ,btohqsg
can. But only make sense to link to Amaze for overseas spend and save on fx fees and get 10x points only for specific MCCs.,btohqsg
no  only get base points 0.4mpd (unless there is promo e.g. 2mpd). Can use citi prestige/premiermiles for 1.3mpd/1.2mpd  but not sure worth the 2% fees.,btohqsg
