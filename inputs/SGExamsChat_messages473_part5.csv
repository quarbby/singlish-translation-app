Jc is one final exam right,btohqsg
that’s if you aim super high la,btohqsg
the way to study and do well in uni doesn’t always translate from jc,btohqsg
like just looking at how you revise a subject for example,btohqsg
uni forces you to be more independent in your learning and some people aren’t prepared for that,btohqsg
if you’re too reliant on the prof materials you’re gonna have trouble,btohqsg
yea idk depends how bad the bad sem is too la,btohqsg
my bad sem was 3.9 but ik to a lot of people that’s good,btohqsg
i nvr had to buy any textbook,btohqsg
feel like that’s more common overseas,btohqsg
also ntu library has most textbooks we need in their database,btohqsg
if it’s not the prof generally avoided it,btohqsg
my prof specifically chose a textbook that was good but also on arxiv,btohqsg
in poly i brought a textbook for $50 bucks,btohqsg
End up lecturer didnt even use it to teach,btohqsg
Best part its only for 1 sem,btohqsg
Same thing happened in my secondary school  except it was 4 textbooks at $200+,btohqsg
the only textbooks i own now are ones i bought myself and actually use,btohqsg
Ya to me it's good lul,btohqsg
my bad sems were those with language modules,btohqsg
but I forgot my worst sem already,btohqsg
