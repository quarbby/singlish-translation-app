I think a possible reason to do ns first before getting jc entry,btohqsg
nah  that one typically is reversed,btohqsg
even if you change citizenship  is still need go jc then go ns,btohqsg
Now I studying modulus function and it is killing brain cells,btohqsg
well to be fair  mod function is from add math,btohqsg
How come they move up to h2 Math? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
i also wondering the same thing tho,btohqsg
but i wld say mod function is not rlly the worst topic so far,btohqsg
Same for proof by induction   they moved it up to f maths ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
oh they moved that up again to h3,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ you seemed to be stuck with the topic for a couple of weeks now...,btohqsg
* cries the memories in cambridge a levels *my brain stopped braining when I transitioned from subtopic to actual past year questions and I can't tell the difference between the usage of cross and dot product lol,btohqsg
Ngl doing math tys paper 1s before march was a damn gd idea,btohqsg
Since like by then all the paper 1 topics are done,btohqsg
ah Singapore only 1 variant of the paper.,btohqsg
oh  in the international syllabus.1 year  2 exams sittings  3 variants of the same paper lol,btohqsg
But to be fair  i think the uk system is quite diff,btohqsg
Is like their one got 3 yrs of high school,btohqsg
So they got more time to cover the topics,btohqsg
ah. Cambridge International hardly take cares of UK folks lol,btohqsg
it is marketed for those country  who lazy to build up their education system. lol,btohqsg
otherwise  is offer students an alternative education system  rather than their local Exam board lol,btohqsg
And then there is Singapore. The hardcore version for pretty much no reason at all,btohqsg
I wondered what happens if h2 math tests poisson distribution and chi square tests,btohqsg
Since to be fair bio also uses chisquare test,btohqsg
Mmm. In sg case  it kinda made the income inequality wider,btohqsg
unlike Malaysia  either the grading system is fucked up  or the Uni Enrollment system is quota based.,btohqsg
Like the gdp is good but,btohqsg
^to those take econs yall will learn this eventually,btohqsg
The poor and the rich are like increasingly far from each other,btohqsg
seems like a common thing worldwide.,btohqsg
Like i rmb saying to myself it wld be useful,btohqsg
But it made me not want to enter a business course,btohqsg
I only took it because i know i can find tuition for it if i ever needed,btohqsg
Ngl. I relate to this even more^,btohqsg
You aint about to find tuition for any other h1 subjects,btohqsg
why get tuition if either way gone fuck,btohqsg
But definitely not literature or cse,btohqsg
I wasted all my parents money to get Cs and Ds,btohqsg
Stopped tuition in src 1 cus i thought it was redundant.,btohqsg
Its good to reflect on your stupidity once in a while,btohqsg
Some survived a levels without tuition,btohqsg
Tuition is mostly good to get you at most a pass,btohqsg
that's just based on limited sample size,btohqsg
fact is in hindsight you can only guess how things would've gone,btohqsg
for A-Level wise  I think Singapore JC did kinda somewhat an OK good job for some JCs recorded lecturers and tutorials and dump them online lol,btohqsg
problem is whether student can brain the materials or not lol,btohqsg
or manage to Google and find them lol,btohqsg
i mean as a whole that's a relatively new thing lol,btohqsg
I think its not a very cut and dry thing to make an absolute statement,btohqsg
