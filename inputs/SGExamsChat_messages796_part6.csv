Since terrorist ruin your plans why don't u learn from em,btohqsg
Since I’m in the branch that deals with people getting charged I’ve seen one NSF get a $200 fine for going overseas without applying 4 times. Don’t know why he only got caught after 4 times though,btohqsg
bros salary got cut in half,btohqsg
Nah it’s just a one time fine. But getting promotion delayed could cost him $25-$50/month for at least 3 months,btohqsg
Now nsf base pay is $755/month,btohqsg
The same guy has been acting and arrested so many times,btohqsg
ticket prices will probably like double if that happens,btohqsg
or at least the problematic one,btohqsg
the oldest of the 777 is already 20y/o,btohqsg
That's why it's so good the planes can be retrofitted instead,btohqsg
I’m surprised that he could live in Singapore illegally for 3 years without getting caught,btohqsg
Boeing will be here no matter what because they are the more economical option,btohqsg
787 Dreamliner still remains one of the most efficient planes,btohqsg

Thinking to buy one of carou but dk if it’s legit,btohqsg

6000ft in a few seconds in scary to say the least,btohqsg

Ya I hope u do well,btohqsg

Bro the scene is from Margin Call lmaoand it's a much better representation of how money works today.So you think we might have put a few people out of business today. That its all for naught. You've been doing that everyday for almost forty years Sam. And if this is all for naught then so is everything out there. Its just money; its made up. Pieces of paper with pictures on it so we don't have to kill each other just to get something to eat. It's not wrong. And it's certainly no different today than its ever been. 1637  1797  1819  37  57  84  1901  07  29  1937  1974  1987-Jesus  didn't that fuck up me up good-92  97  2000 and whatever we want to call this. It's all just the same thing over and over; we can't help ourselves. And you and I can't control it  or stop it  or even slow it. Or even ever-so-slightly alter it. We just react. And we make a lot money if we get it right. And we get left by the side of the side of the road if we get it wrong. And there have always been and there always will be the same percentage of winners and losers. Happy foxes and sad sacks. Fat cats and starving dogs in this world. Yeah  there may be more of us today than there's ever been. But the percentages-they stay exactly the same.,btohqsg
