These are 2 different places sia,btohqsg
Eh what u talking about don't understand,btohqsg
U got to UPenn and Cambridge har,btohqsg
Eh US law is grad school sia,btohqsg
us med is grad sch too,btohqsg
Me advise go US no go UK,btohqsg
but US vs SG then I think SG lol,btohqsg
Meaning if u don't do data science u can't get job,btohqsg
This one ok la easier than getting h1b,btohqsg
U got talk to my junior or not,btohqsg
Lol I ultimate bridge for people sia,btohqsg
I think I refer like 10 20 people liao,btohqsg
maybe if chio I go UK,btohqsg
Plus honestly cam is not worth,btohqsg
Hhh the overseas kids having party now,btohqsg
Come talk shit abt ur school,btohqsg
ord ord I want to ord,btohqsg
say it in the kukubird cheer way,btohqsg
Eh anyone wanna ask about Oxbridge or Ives or jobs in deep tech/finance can pm me,btohqsg
Better make myself useful around here,btohqsg
Jobs in general also can ma,btohqsg
Cos me got Oxbridge and Ivy equivalent offers?,btohqsg
How can I get in ETHZ and work for the big b0ss I want,btohqsg
I just interviewed with a couple firms just last week,btohqsg
i dont see patrotism as an actual virtue,btohqsg
Eh u change profile pic har,btohqsg
Just go overseas for a while,btohqsg
Go China or eu or US,btohqsg
then u know why sg so good le,btohqsg
i think patriotism no matter which country ur from is unnecessary,btohqsg
I think being stuck in the saf for 2 years is unnecessary,btohqsg
Globalisation just got fucked by corona,btohqsg
but I am an NSF so,btohqsg
it's jsut a matter of opinion,btohqsg
i just dont see my country as an extension of myself,btohqsg
ofc contribute to society yada yada,btohqsg
but not necessarily my own country,btohqsg
I love Singapore not because I'm born here,btohqsg
it's narcissistic to think ur own country is the best country,btohqsg
unless you are actually the best in something,btohqsg
like the US can flex anytime ;),btohqsg
i agree sg is not bad,btohqsg
and put their military behind the flex,btohqsg
SG has the most pragmatic COMBINATION of policies,btohqsg
then migrate lor if u don't like SG,btohqsg
"but patriotism to me is ""no matter what my country do its still the best""",btohqsg
yea no matter what my country do it is the best,btohqsg
no one say they dont like,btohqsg
Just that SG sometime fuck me up,btohqsg
tbh sg is one of the best countries,btohqsg
not the best  but one of the best ba imo,btohqsg
nationalism and patriotism two v different things,btohqsg
I feel is the best ba,btohqsg
But haven't compare thoroughly with Nordic countries,btohqsg
I can be patriotic and still criticise the fuck out of the govt,btohqsg
seeing UK and US now  maybe yeah lor for now,btohqsg
Wait till I study Nordic countries a while,btohqsg
sg is gr8 in comparison to a lot of country w regards to a lot of things  but like everything got flaws,btohqsg
Will you be patriotic if your criticism results in damage to national security?,btohqsg
miloman needs to go back to miloland,btohqsg
Don't criticize just cos it disadvantage u,btohqsg
yah but u say until SG like trash,btohqsg
if u think it is so bad pls just move overseas,btohqsg
i just say im not patriotic,btohqsg
and i tot  patritoism is nationalism,btohqsg
why u tryna pick fight again,btohqsg
idt my criticism will ever amount to that much weightbut if that criticism results in that kind of damage  don't say la LOL  want to air those kind of stuff out  got appropriate  and not that I'm expecting such channels to work anyway,btohqsg
SG is bad in some ways doesn't mean I have to forgo citizenship what,btohqsg
The sooner you learn that not everyone is worth your fingers' effort to type anything at all  the better,btohqsg
but tbh  this isnt the right attitude at all,btohqsg
i think ppl who don't love your country,btohqsg
if singaporeans had moved overseas just because they hate british rule  singapore would not have changed,btohqsg
people who love their country STAY and change it for the better,btohqsg
Even if it doesn't - let's just imagine the very practical scenario that criticism itself is seen as political unrest and hence less investment pours in - what's the best way forward?,btohqsg
U can love ur country and still kb it no?,btohqsg
but if u dont love den move overseas lor,btohqsg
nth wrong with kb abt ur own country ah i also kb abt it,btohqsg
govt need to be more receptive,btohqsg
ppl who say not patriotic etc got problem lor,btohqsg
i dont love my sch  i should quit sch i guess,btohqsg
you can love your country but hate its policies and the way its run,btohqsg
PM Lee alr start OSC liao  even HCS/PS(PMO) have IIRC said Civil Service do need to listen to ground feedback  what more can be done,btohqsg
the variable is as long as u love ur country,btohqsg
if u dont love it  den dont stay,btohqsg
i rlly dont see why globalism is wrong,btohqsg
US is land of two laws  it's very simple.,btohqsg
The land having two laws is very stark in US.,btohqsg
den u shd see what's happning now,btohqsg
but sometimes the way it's run makes you hate your country  in this case  you can still stay and change it lmao,btohqsg
my core value is globalism i cannot comprehend the latter,btohqsg
yes  means u still love ur country,btohqsg
change starts from the top  a country and organisation reflects its leaders and their attitudes,btohqsg
THE SAF 8 CORE VALUES ARE:,btohqsg
This sounds 2pc to mean anything,btohqsg
That's why I don't like the scholars bro,btohqsg
The cam psc scholar have no idea what's going on in the society,btohqsg
and the world is too complex to be ideal for any one group of person,btohqsg
The scholar I see quite self absorbed one I feel,btohqsg
we can go back and forth for the entire night and can never come to a conclusion because there's gonna be another issue that pops up,btohqsg
How they rule me in the future sia,btohqsg
what goes up will go down,btohqsg
so one day these PSC scholars,btohqsg
all of them just high flyer iron rice bowl,btohqsg
Scholars should be up for more scrutiny what,btohqsg
they can fuck up smrt until lan lan guess where they are now,btohqsg
scrutiny doesnt mean hope for them to fail what,btohqsg
If not they have all the benefits and none of the associated cost,btohqsg
one day the hammer will come down,btohqsg
and what would Singapore be without it being globalised,btohqsg
I never HOPE for them fail,btohqsg
no  the govt built a self protective system alr,btohqsg
I want them to succeed but I doubt their character,btohqsg
maybe i wasn't specific enuff but not the time to debtae the merits of globalism HAHA,btohqsg
Come down do what? Area cleaning?,btohqsg
Ok u say why u don't like globalist,btohqsg
World isn't fair though ? ? ? ? ?  ? ? ? ?? ?,btohqsg
im just here to talk shit,btohqsg
Bruh u in power then u no care about ur ppl  is it,btohqsg
eh eh I need go overseas one leh  globalism bloody work out for me 😂,btohqsg
U not scared u Kenna fucked in election meh,btohqsg
Most of Civil Service never enter politics though,btohqsg
If they really need a pay raise they should be able to find it,btohqsg
Eh I tot psc mostly become politician,btohqsg
Mostly? There's only so many Ministers,btohqsg
Even if you include all the Parl secs that's like a few 10 20 people,btohqsg
You have CEO positions and Chairmanships to fill,btohqsg
Oops so Minister background mostly from where,btohqsg
Minister just 1 portion of the elite what,btohqsg
I don't care about the elites. I care about how those in power rule sg,btohqsg
The elites can continue earn money in their own sector without touching politics,btohqsg
I don't care about this also doesn't affect me ma,btohqsg
Ya  and the Perm Secs rule SG as much as the Ministers do,btohqsg
Then perm sec background is from where leh,btohqsg
probably does affect u in the long run tbh,btohqsg
look at how for example bill gates,btohqsg
but has money so can do a lot of shit,btohqsg
PSC  though they always try get from private who complain 'pay low',btohqsg
Kk I get ur point but bgates too extreme an eg,btohqsg
Eh wait I don't understand this,btohqsg
So I forgot to go for discovery day😱 and I didn't receive any admission offer,btohqsg
U mean people in private who complain pay low go psc earn more cash?,btohqsg
My fren went for the talk and told me there's a link,btohqsg
Which leads u to the offer,btohqsg
No  usually if public sec want to headhunt obviously they go for big shot right. These big shot can earn like biggggggggg $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ so they complain public sector pay 2low.And if they are joining the pub sector higherup  we are talking possibly 20k+/mois 'low' to them,btohqsg
There is a lot of higherups who are PSC,btohqsg
I mean honestly how to change,btohqsg
The whole point is their private job pay high so they no incentive to be corrupt,btohqsg
Tell the private sector accept low pay,btohqsg
But they have 'lifestyle' to maintain,btohqsg
I mean if u up there,btohqsg
Can go check the salary Percentile,btohqsg
Banking fresh grad earn 12k monthly le,btohqsg
now i know who to date,btohqsg
Quants earn 20k monthly as fresh grad,btohqsg
ya hes a banking fresh grad,btohqsg
I know only 1 example who earn that level so don't think too much about it,btohqsg
U will see hundreds and hundreds,btohqsg
He never go FAANG is it,btohqsg
bruh my friend grad imperial went to investment banking pay is FUCKING insane,btohqsg
That's what I'm talking about what,btohqsg
i got fren who became investment banking analyst  end up being a douchebag keep bragging about how girls only swipe him right cuz he's rich  call them gold diggers etc,btohqsg
Different world  don't worry about it,btohqsg
I think he >>100k GBP a year,btohqsg
until he expose himself on insta,btohqsg

Second year after grad IBD analyst is 100k,btohqsg
I have to go for these high pay shit to clear debt,btohqsg
After that I'm free to go back to tech,btohqsg
lmao  usually these people started day 1,btohqsg
time to lose hair over IBD moolah,btohqsg
Eh my main point is 20k is legit low for these elites,btohqsg
i would literally kill for that,btohqsg
In 3 years u will earn that amount,btohqsg
I mean  afaik the highest 'paid' individual whose pay is within Govt control is ~20million,btohqsg
then can fund all your sugarbabies,btohqsg
i like my social relations pure,btohqsg
and i dont like young handsome but dumb guys,btohqsg
If he don't put that info up in public,btohqsg
he just put job title on tinder,btohqsg
that he get a lot swipes,btohqsg
Then he looking for gold diggers what,btohqsg
he just wan brag only la,btohqsg

Aiyo IBD is just dog job,btohqsg
"You can go around flexing ""eh you know my boyfriend ah...INVESTMENT BANKER LEH""",btohqsg
Honestly IBD analyst is Lowest of the bunch,btohqsg
proceed to shower money on the plebs,btohqsg
Actual money is not in sell side,btohqsg
So the key is to be old and ugly. Got it,btohqsg
Btw investment banking is sell side,btohqsg
male sugarbabies cannot even take care of u,btohqsg
why would u wanna date them,btohqsg
they cannot even take care of themselves,btohqsg
Eh cos dating is not about being cared for?,btohqsg
Gender roles too deep seated liao,btohqsg
But isn't dating first about being able to be fine with urself,btohqsg
Then is about being more awesome as a couple?,btohqsg
Depends what does this even mean,btohqsg
i can do without a date for years,btohqsg
Earn a lot of money counted bo,btohqsg
Or wanting to build company from ground up,btohqsg

But the profs are supposedly bad at explaining stuff,btohqsg
This is bad reason to choose school leh,btohqsg
Cambridge Prof all suck in lectures,btohqsg
i think in uni ur suppose self learn,btohqsg
This is real bs imo.Yes there are a lot of self-learnt things but there is a reason top unis still hire teaching-track faculty,btohqsg
Undergrad teaching is quite important. Just that lotsa unis don't provide good teaching,btohqsg
Yh I can self learn ... Totally not a problem ...Internal screams intensifies,btohqsg
Let’s just say that he’s an accurate source,btohqsg
Cos I'm here my friends are here?,btohqsg
Ivy I believe the ranking for teaching goes something like this based on impression and friends.Princeton  Brown  Yale  Columbia  dart  (Penn  Harvard  corn),btohqsg
Those in bracket is just one tier but no specific rank,btohqsg
Oops later I kenna scolded by ivy people here,btohqsg

$8 can only buy me 2.66 packs of chicken rice downstairs,btohqsg
nowadays chicken rice not $2.5 or $3 meh,btohqsg
