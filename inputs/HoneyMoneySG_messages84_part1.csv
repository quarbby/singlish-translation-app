In Dec  you can use the tax assessment calculator found on IRAS website to estimate your assessable income. Then you can head to CPF website to do VCMA/RSTU (before 31 Dec) for tax relief of up to 8k for self and 8k for loved ones.Based on the table  the first 40k only have to pay $550 because of the low rates between 0% to 3.5%. Subsequently the rates will be boosted much significantly to 7% and above.If your assessable income is below 28k  you won't fully benefit from the 8k VCMA/RSTU tax relief limit. In fact  it would be more recommended to transfer OA to SA if you have yet meet the 40k magic number for SA. And always VCMA till BHS before RSTU!You can read more herehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/158140,btohqsg

Please note that there is a difference (although i dont think it affects that much if you’re not a finance person) between index funds and ETF. Endowus only has funds and not ETFs (s&p500 is an etf). So technically you cant buy into the s&p500 via endowus cause endowus only buys into funds,btohqsg
