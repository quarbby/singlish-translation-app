This is a very broad question bro.Are. You investing long term or short term? Do you want to actively manage or do passive do it and forget about it.,btohqsg
actively manage a short term investment,btohqsg
For short term  the public equity markets are very choppy. One day up  next day down.Suggest you put in one those Cash funds  in Stashaway or endowus..,btohqsg
Ok noted thank u! which is better? stashaway or endowus? would you recommend GXS ?,btohqsg
GXS is just 5k limit..Both ST and Endowus are good but endowus has more options to invest with cpf and srs  plus fees is low. So yeah.,btohqsg
Can't.  Money is from hsbc EGA.  What is the second best?,btohqsg
ok thank u lemme download endowus now then,btohqsg
Then better do FD. Because rest all mostly need salary crediting or miniocard send every month. So if you just want fuss free. Then FD is good. Or 3 month or 6 month T-bill.,btohqsg
depends how much you have and whether if you want liquidity and want it to be locked or not. after EGA next best is SCB Wealth Saver 5% but u need 200K,btohqsg
Does this require salary crediting? Or any other requirements?,btohqsg
SCB Wealth Saver ? just need to be new clients  5% for the first 6 months  minimum 200K  after that back to 2%,btohqsg
Those who cash top up via RSTU  excess amount above BRS or FRS cant be withdrawn at 55  am i correct? Only can get back via monthly payout after 65,btohqsg
Hi ðŸ‘‹. Can anyone advise me? I need to make payment for MOE sch fees via SAM monthly. Quite alot if CC doesnt include SAM payment. Is there any CC that can get something back via SAM payment? Thanks.,btohqsg
Hmmm last checked couple days also UOB told me it was XNAP = online.,btohqsg
hi  can i check how you get 4.66%? cos i read the tnc  max is 4.65% of bonus interest till 30 june,btohqsg
could you direct me to the part of the tnc which states that itâ€™s perpetual? thank you!,btohqsg
Ok. Yes. It's 4.65%. My bad.,btohqsg
For personal banking it's even lower - 4.50%,btohqsg
So total for personal banking is 0.05+4.5+ 1 = 5.55%. And yes only till 30 June.,btohqsg
correct me if i'm wrong  but from my understanding  the 5.55% is only valid till the 2nd mth,btohqsg
in the 3rd mth  need to deposit $2k and have 5 transactions to get 5.55%  but the 5.55% is only on the top-up amt in 3rd mth,btohqsg
Speaking abt the HSBC EGA acc  is it need to hesd down to the bank outlet to apply? I have the revolution card  but when I called to enquire on the EGA to apply online  the agent mentioned that since I only have the credit card  I need to head down to the branch to open an account.,btohqsg
No. Its additional fund compared to the month of Feb. Assuming you signed up for promo in March. And the interest is till 30th June.,btohqsg
Hsbc terms are complicated but usually offer the highest rates. To make things simple  to enjoy the full 5.55%  you got to have money in every alternate month.,btohqsg
So if you got 2 accounts to play ping pong with.... You get the max interest every month,btohqsg
Don't think so. That doesn't make sense,btohqsg
to enjoy additional 1%  need to dep 2k + 5 transaction every alternate mth,btohqsg
I edited from 4.55% to 5.55%.,btohqsg
Correct. But the additional 1% is not just on the 2k. It's on your total deposit balance.,btohqsg
yeah  for the 1st 2 months. cos itâ€™s considered the â€˜top-up amountâ€™,btohqsg
3rd month need to top up again and only top-up amount is entitled to 5.55%,btohqsg
hi  understand that healthhub still gets 4 mpd with wwmc. but as i already maxed out the 2k  anyone know if altitude visa will get 1.2mpd? their t&c dont state explicitly the mcc that they exclude.,btohqsg
Then why would ppl want to top up RSTU? Having to pay IRAS income tax at 7 or 11.5% is better than putting into SA where i cant touch until beyond 65,btohqsg
Anyone knows for the CIMB signup  do we have to self collect the ergotune or it will delivered?,btohqsg
anyone knows if the vcma tax relief is automatically applied during filing tax? 1st timer here,btohqsg
Yes  but if you do it now  it's for next year's filing,btohqsg
hi guys  can I confirm that for prudential insurance payments  best way is to use amex TCB + gpmc for 1.5% cashback? My insurance amount lesser than $300/mth so not considering maybank platinum.,btohqsg
Amex tcb for Grabpay topups will be nerfed on 4th Apr.,btohqsg
oh shag LOL. Nerfed to how many %? I thought only UOB absolute + gpmc kena ðŸ¥²,btohqsg
wef 4 Apr TCB don't earn cashback for grabpay topups.,btohqsg
pay your insurance via annual payments instead of monthly and you save the few % off the heightened costs for monthly payments instead ðŸ˜‚But yea  the Amex TCB+GPMC is going to be 0% on apr 4. UOB Absolute + GPMC left with 0.3%.,btohqsg
Think uob amex top up nerf to 0.3 but amex tcb -0,btohqsg
Count down to top up mayhem haha 5k haha,btohqsg
unless want to use to clock the $500 card spend criteria for UOB bonus interest assuming don't have any other spendings to use to clock.,btohqsg
depending on your insurance premium and the amount in the bank  it might be worthwhile to pay monthly instead of annually and forgot the discount for annual payment,btohqsg
quick question  for HSBC EGA  if i open this account in the coming week and apply for the SMS promo (before 31Mar) then move funds in before March ends  how will the promotion mechanics work?Does it calculate the interest based on how many days in March that the funds were in the account  OR it will only start calculating and the additional interest applied from April onwards?,btohqsg
this is why I a bit hesitant to make use of the EGA promo. in case accidentally do a wrong step  will only know few months later.,btohqsg
this one not called nerf sia. This is outright CANCELLED ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
some people can still use amex for direct payment for other purpose,btohqsg
This is only a matter of time once uob absolute announced their nerf,btohqsg
