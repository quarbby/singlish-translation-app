Pika World Daily Update 17 August 2021Markets figuring out Its PriorityThe market has multiple headlines  but the broad indices retreated sharply in the early trading session only to recover as S&P 500 and Dow Jones continued to hit a record high. Nasdaq lagged the broader market.The political uncertainty in Afghanistan and the weaker Chinese data feed the market with some direction.Still  investors look beyond the current news and set eyes on FOMC minutes for the July meeting set to release on Wednesday. The expectation is that the Fed might be tempted to start withdrawing its bond purchase by the next three months.The Chinese Economy WobblesThe latest economic indicates an uncertain recovery story in China as Chinese officials acknowledged the weakness seen in the market. The factory output and retail sales had slowed considerably  missing expectation as the steam engine of a roaring comeback cools.Multiple Headwinds in a Resilient EconomyThere were many challenges in China. The natural disaster of lousy weather and significant floods disrupt the localised economy. The spread of Delta Variant had severely affected the service sector and appeared to punish the economy with a low tolerance of Covid. We have seen how a terminal of the worldâ€™s busiest port closed due to just one worker being tested positive.The crackdown of big tech in China added to the list of concerns as there is data protection concern by the Chinese government. A look at the CSI 300 Index of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges blue chips saw a decline of 6% this year. This contrasts with Stoxx Europe 600  which had climbed about 18%. On the other hand  the S&P 500 is up by a stunning 20%.Pika World continue to shift some attention to the European equities.Where is the Money Flowing?Analysts appear quick to point to the semiconductors and biotech as receivers of fund managers investment  which have largely been spared from the regulatory crackdown given their importance in the competitive landscape with America. However  this does not mean it is immune  as when the tide changes  it can punish the sectors swiftly. Being nimble seems to be an advantageous move in the current market environment.Whatâ€™s on the Menu Today?It will be a week of important data.At 8.30 pm  we will welcome Core Retail Sales which we expect to grow by 0.1%  down from the robust 1.3% in the prior period.At 10 pm  the data on Business Inventories are expected to grow 0.8%  an increase from 0.5%. Recall that Pika World in the previous weekend edition pointed out that the drawdown on inventory is unsustainable  and businesses would need to replenish their stockpile level. Therefore  this data will be critical to keeping the sentiment positive on US GDP data in the next term.It is 17 August  Tuesday  7.20 am in Singapore and 7.20  pm in New York. While a rough and volatile ride might come  Pika World will be bringing you the latest update.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg
