Huh the rim also considered sport rims ah..,btohqsg
Thanks all for your help. At least we knew there will be issue pertaining to this matter.,btohqsg
No la. Don’t know u copy from who. This is a oversimplification n misjudgment. Stock rims designed to meet general standard only. N they r heavier. mass produced so cheaper. they r not for performance or aesthetics unless u upgrade. Aftermarket rims can be powerful sia. Forged aluminium or even cf. reduced weight n increased strength. Can be v exp.,btohqsg

Got any good deals for Vios (XP150 2018-2023) model?,btohqsg
And like to ask what to take in mind considering this particular Vios’s problems?,btohqsg
It’s the car CDC uses for Class 3A learners.,btohqsg
Question is... why vios? 13k depre for this car is absurd when theres so many other brands out there,btohqsg
Maybe I had a liking to it when I drive it during practical lessons at CDC,btohqsg
Only 3 other cars I’m looking at which are all learner cars. Can’t look to BYDs for first cars- Honda Jazz/Fit- Honda City- Hyundai Kona 1st Gen,btohqsg
Agree. Why is even a vios so expensive? 🥲,btohqsg
Buy car only need to see 3 things. Upfront and monthly if u can afford it ma.Then after that you see the coe/depre see it make sense ma..,btohqsg
Nonsense. Only 1 thing. Like or don't like,btohqsg
Price doesn't matter when you can 100% loan,btohqsg

there's also other things to consider when considering the car lor. If it's in good functional condition as everything is working normally. Critical areas like brakes  hydraulic fluid  power plant  chassis condition and so on,btohqsg
Maybe with a downpayment that is below $40 000 and montly cost below $1100,btohqsg
I seen vios and jazz within that bracket,btohqsg
Bro all these is assume to be known de,btohqsg
Before u even buy a car. Pls send for PPI also,btohqsg
No PPI. No buy. Thats my rule. If dealer don’t let me send. I don’t buy.If dealer don’t accept my conditions for PPI  I also don’t buy.,btohqsg
Your down payment $40k and below $1.1k can get u a nice car that is better than vios,btohqsg
Go find a nicer car la bro. Vios don’t drive alr.,btohqsg
U drive for family or work. Got kids?,btohqsg
Most importantly. Don’t take this advice. This is a bs advice 😂,btohqsg
