but isn't scoot price the same as other websites ?,btohqsg
No leh i seetrip.comprice about $100 cheaper than scoot,btohqsg
Then u give and take loh  cant have all the goodies de mah,btohqsg
the tickets intrip.comare provided by third party agencies. It could be cheaper cos they purchased in bulk. But do note the risk is if there are any issues like flight delays  cancellations  you have to go to the agencies and not scoot.,btohqsg
last nov or dec 2023 trip.comhas $20 discount on any flight out of SG. so it was cheaper to book those short haul flights ontrip.com,btohqsg

Have anyone received their UOB  stash interest for last month? Usually it is at the beginning of the month but mine is not in.,btohqsg
We have to restart all again,btohqsg
Received on 1 Mar. Have you checked if ur Feb avg balance is equal or more than Jan‚Äôs?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt touch the account except to transfer out the interest for the month. So usually the balance remains the same.,btohqsg
you move out the interest in whole down to the last cent? did u leave any small bits?I'm just thinking is there a possibility the small base interest credited on the last day of the month could have messed u upespecially since feb base interest is less than jan base interest,btohqsg
should be in..i guess your MAB fell short..,btohqsg
Best is end of day everyday track then can compare against previous month..,btohqsg
U can login to ur UOB web account  it tells you your MAB in the last 3 months.Let us know what you find.,btohqsg
Which date n What time you transfer out the January base interest n bonus interest respectively? Is it same day it was credited before 9pm?,btohqsg
transfer out same day interest is credited before 10.30pm in Jan and feb?,btohqsg
my guess is because End Jan is bigger than End Feb interest.. it messed up..For example ($100 000 + $5) > ($100 000 + $4) MAB,btohqsg
Man.. all that work for 3% p.a.,btohqsg
this is why i don't touch Stash or OCBC 365.... i am not comfortable with the digital all or nothing incremental balance mechanismsudden death like last time Citi maxisave,btohqsg

Yep is on the list   I'm just wondering how the exchange rate work when depositing SGD to usd,btohqsg
A thought  if we want to have an account for storing purpose to deploy funds in and out  I suggest trust account where if we hit the 5 spend criteria and being NTUC member can get 2.5 to 3%. It can store up to 500k and the interest applies evenly.  All these for minimal effort.,btohqsg
