Misleading people just for the sake of understanding?,btohqsg
Explain how my A math went from c6 to b3 then confirm got some magic inside it it is impossible for me,btohqsg
Every subject is only 25% A rate,btohqsg
But Iâ€™m pretty sure bell curve is helping a set number of people getting each different grades and since GT can be adjusted it indirectly also influences the number of people getting each grade,btohqsg
I'm serious  spreading untrue information for the sake of understanding? That sounds pretty ironic if you were to think about it.,btohqsg
National exams will have lower A rates,btohqsg
A bell curve also ensures an equal no of ppl fail the exam,btohqsg
And we dont see that happening,btohqsg
Just as how an equal no do very well,btohqsg
False hope is better than no hope when desperation kicks in :D,btohqsg
