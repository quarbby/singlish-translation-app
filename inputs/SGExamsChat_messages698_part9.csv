then during tutorial he keep side eyeing me and dun talk to me at all lol,btohqsg
coz i was a shy kid in jc,btohqsg
actually i have not grown out of the shy bubble,btohqsg
during orientation i talked like 10 words a day,btohqsg
in uni there is something called free loaders  so in a team of 5  only 2-3 people are contributing to tutorials:-(,btohqsg
then when i got my cg something just clicked between me and my classmates,btohqsg
tbh this  it is not coz i dw answer  it is coz i shy raise up my hand lmao coz i was literally in the middle aisle and eye level of the lecturer,btohqsg
and LT4 is so big with 600+ people,btohqsg
i only talked a lot to people i alr got close to,btohqsg
idk how but my cliques already formed since ori,btohqsg
i mean for me i make it a point to never be a burden to others so if it's a graded thing i'll get it done. if anything i'm the one carrying others...i just don't finish tutorials when it's not part of my grade,btohqsg
after orientation there is only one guy i wave to whenever i see him,btohqsg
the rest all have their own lives alr,btohqsg
i had orientation in my cg so it is easier i guess,btohqsg
my first cce lesson with our cg talk abit with the ppl sitting around me,btohqsg
they were quite fast in releasing classes,btohqsg
then up until now i haven't talked to them again,btohqsg
i hope u made friends at least,btohqsg
tbh that's alr my biggest worry gone,btohqsg
for me i struggle to be the first person who speaks...so it is other people who speaks to me first,btohqsg
then i feel bad when we all just sitting there not talking to each other,btohqsg
yea i can feel the awkward silence,btohqsg
but we had free seating tho in the classrm,btohqsg
usually i will sit with my closest friend,btohqsg
i remembered in math lecture  one person from my class had to sit my himself/herself at another row with another class coz 1 table broke lol,btohqsg
i sit at same spot throughout the 2y,btohqsg
but now j1 still no homeroom right,btohqsg
IM AT SEMBAWANG WHARVES YET I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SINGLE WAVE OF WATER ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€,btohqsg
then when it's fm before physics lecture all the chem ppl alr in their seats while we have to walk and find our class,btohqsg
that is the downside of mix subject combinationh,btohqsg
also need to guide the autistic girl there in case she gets lost,btohqsg
my brother is actually very good in direction,btohqsg
i dunno why and from when they mixed subject combination,btohqsg
same i thought fm used to be 4H2 only,btohqsg
i tot u mentioned it has something to do with the new system,btohqsg
yeah i heard cld be because of that,btohqsg
tbh not sure if i would do well if i had taken fm,btohqsg
very funny last time the only fm combi tmjc offer is CFMx,btohqsg
oh i was referring to the mix subj combi classes,btohqsg
maybe it was introduced by the new principal,btohqsg
oh yeah our cg is the only one other than s210 to have geog in our timetable,btohqsg
bc 2 students taking pfmg and the fm students all allocated to one class specifically,btohqsg
the s210 class is the contrasting subject that is not econs,btohqsg
then our class is the exception\,btohqsg
s1 shld all be PCME/PFME only,btohqsg
i really now think that perhaps birth rates are really decreasing that they have to merge the schools,btohqsg
s2 all but our class and s210 the timetable has contrasting subject other than econs,btohqsg
My batch 210 is PCMe only,btohqsg
i think usually the last class for s2 and s3 series is where all the ppl taking hist/geog/lit go,btohqsg
im not sure about 2020 batch...but my batch hasA101  A201-202  A301-303  S101  S201-212  S301-310  S401-404  S411-415  S501-502,btohqsg
