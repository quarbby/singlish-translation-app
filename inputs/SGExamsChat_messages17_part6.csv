merit scholarships are awarded by faculty,btohqsg
but unless u represent SG very hard to get global merit,btohqsg

all the global merit ppl i know basically 90RP + H3 and some epic talent,btohqsg
the other 2 is uni level,btohqsg
u referring to the non merit/global ones right,btohqsg
but merit is the easiest to get alr,btohqsg
now uni level focusing more on SoC and all the stem courses,btohqsg
how do you know whether the faculty offers a lot or not,btohqsg
so they allocate more scholarships to those courses,btohqsg
