counseller useless lah. TBH my friend say if you feel like shit  take a deep breath and go to IMH  best counsellors all there (unless you wanna go private),btohqsg
life saver bro especially the night before exams,btohqsg
The good teachers are really good lah  but the bad ones are really shitty,btohqsg
I know  it's really sad. My JC1 counsellor was quite understanding though. But everyone is different. I have also heard about complaints about the SOS hotline with the operators,btohqsg
Ohh ok maybe school counsellors are tanking for the ricebowl. Maybe they themselves r half dead on the inside alr ü§£Oh but i hope u r better now. R u?,btohqsg
most school counsellors are there to just tell you to be happy when you're sad. if you genuinely need help it's better to see a trained therapist outside of school,btohqsg
I was from Jurong sec hehe,btohqsg
Oh.. wow.. whats good about there? Cos in terms of difficulty level  uk standard is higher  is it?,btohqsg
all the pain has went away,btohqsg
UK has more emphasise on pure mathematics than say  Singapore.But I like the environment and the way of life there. It felt so normal and I was so at ease.,btohqsg
my pri sch counsellor was a super sweet lady and we genuinely liked her  but my sec sch counsellor... homophobic  hatred against other religions  etc etc. seriously? how to be counsellor like that,btohqsg
do they allow alum to go back to school for teacher day?,btohqsg
TBH tho  UK's A Levels is nothing compared to singapore,btohqsg
My private tutors have helped me more than school teachers cos my school teachers very busy  no time for me. But my tutors were moe teachers from their own school too  how come they can give tuition??? Like got loophole hereüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÖ,btohqsg
eh working and pursuing part time dip,btohqsg
Homophobia is quite common in Singapore though...,btohqsg
I am talking about university. Not A levels,btohqsg
MOE Teachers can do a certain amount of tuition per month I believe,btohqsg
honestly maybe sch counsellors are like that as they give counselling for free,btohqsg
If they talk about who didnt do well wouldnt it be digging their wound?? And exposing their shame n inferiority too,btohqsg
because can earn more through tuition mah,btohqsg
uk uni easier than sg one?,btohqsg
Uk unis have a stronger mathematics tradition,btohqsg
yea  i'm not sure if 'hate' is the correct word la  but she would preach her own religion openly and also use her god's name to justify her dislike of LGBT,btohqsg
my egeog teacher would only help those who got potential,btohqsg
Somewhere in northern england. I don't wish to share too much here,btohqsg
Huh. Whats then their significant really???? I am so confused,btohqsg
if i give up stats for h2 math can still get A anot,btohqsg
Never been to NUS or NTU  so I don't know. But it's not that easy  trust me.If you go to Oxbridge it would be crazily difficult,btohqsg
I never tried imh counsellors before so idk but i felt the most impactful ‚Äúcounsellors‚Äù in my life were some sales boss / corporate trainer in my work life üòÇ,btohqsg
Then when any parents approach me during my school open house  I always tell the truth about how trashy most teachers actually are,btohqsg
It's why Acta Mathematica's latest issue has no University of Cambridge authors/s,btohqsg
You might pull down their L1r5 and then their school rep drop,btohqsg
their bonus and all kena whack,btohqsg
i tink if i go uni wil die,btohqsg
I can't believe people would preach religion as all schools are supposed to be secular,btohqsg
unfortunately  yea. but that doesn't make it acceptable. furthermore as a counsellor  they should be open to everyone and their office should be a safe space. she would post about anti-LGBT stuff on her facebook and idk what would happen in her office but i knew a few schoomates who had to see her and they're LGBT,btohqsg
lol but honestly some teachers actually agreed with me lmao,btohqsg
Yep. Interviewer informed me I'm in. Later  they rejected me...,btohqsg
Actually my sec sch teachers - i feel most of them are really good. They are extremely dedicated and good in their field. 99% of them are,btohqsg
Sounds like someone somewhere screwed up a process,btohqsg
in school  she has mentioned it once or twice  but she preaches on her public social media,btohqsg
I tried for Cambridge. You cannot do both except in special cases,btohqsg
Lol üòÇ they just need an upgraded phone operator,btohqsg
My sec 4 match teacher used to lock her students in a room to do A math till 7,btohqsg
That's good. In my school  only math dept is decent,btohqsg
Wow  I'm so sorry to hear that,btohqsg
