Basic oil change should be about $100 to $125 for the fit I believe,btohqsg
Apart from that your battery and alternator must check with them,btohqsg
Malaysia is not drastically cheaper for a basic oil change  especially when you consider the costs of driving over and the tolls etc.,btohqsg
Might be slightly cheaper for the parts that you want to change though,btohqsg
I called the car battery company and they believe it’s the actuator problem and not the battery. Then again my battery is 1.5 years   need to change soon,btohqsg
Ooo how much is a Honda fit actuator and battery if want to replace tho?,btohqsg
I think you ask your workshop to advise you instead,btohqsg
Because part and labour costs best coming from them,btohqsg
Don't just blindly trust one place,btohqsg
Once you get the quote from one place,btohqsg
Call another and ask for a price,btohqsg
Bro dont service every 10k  do it arnd every 8k. Yr car will thank you,btohqsg
Sometimes need diy  battery go workshop A  servicing go workshop B to get cheaper price. That’s what I did.,btohqsg
It’s like doing renovation. Get main con to manage everything for you  or find Subcon to do the specific work,btohqsg
Huh really? Never get a call leh,btohqsg

There’s another way to look at it. Sometimes people will draw you in with Low price and then suddenly… oh sorry there’s still sound… CHANGE AND BUY NEW WKWKWKWKWKWKWKWK,btohqsg

It's not about the power.. its about the sound HAHHAHA,btohqsg
Gently reminding pedestrians that there is a car approaching so they should stop staring at their phones and look up to where they are walking,btohqsg
for bikes is actually useful tho,btohqsg
agreed. With some of the hybrids and EV no sound being emitted.. really a danger considering all the noise cancelling headphones nowadays..,btohqsg
got one guy think that straight pipe civic is fast,btohqsg
Some sort of whir or bzzz is piped out through speakers by law,btohqsg
i sat some EVs before  it was damn quiet,btohqsg
Obviously won't be as loud as a v8 bah,btohqsg
or some i see driving along the street  sound was very minimal,btohqsg
Almost got by one cause I couldn’t hear it coming LOL,btohqsg
yah  the sound too minimal alr  especially since nowadays ppl plug in headphones and walk -.- gna kena rob also dk alr,btohqsg
the only sound i actually hear from EV is actually their reversing sound..,btohqsg
You plug in headphones sure cannot hear regular Toyota  kia  Hyundai also,btohqsg
A stock car quite quiet also,btohqsg
is soundproofing a car a good investment?hate the rain sound and road sound.....,btohqsg
But how are you gonna hear your engine roar!!,btohqsg
Then if you don’t wanna hear the road then sure,btohqsg
Road noise must invest in better tyres first,btohqsg
Can do dampening for more soundproofing,btohqsg
Can do wheel wells and doors for road noise,btohqsg
It does add weight to your doors and the car,btohqsg
But not too too much if you're a regular car,btohqsg
im using some toyotires and the road noise is slighter better now.but during rainy days still can hear all the water sounds very clearly thru roof and wheels...,btohqsg
any good place to recommend for sound proofing?,btohqsg
not sure want to do it in SG or Msia...been considering for quite long,btohqsg
rather than do sound proofing  upgrade your sound system,btohqsg
drown out the noise with music can liao,btohqsg
i think this option gonna be more expensive than soundproofing.,btohqsg
or do you have any price friendly sound system to recommend?,btohqsg
The thing with sound systems is that they too require dampening sheets to be used so that you don't hear rattling plastics,btohqsg
If you can afford it  do it in Singapore as easier to go back for any rectification,btohqsg
my current car have a sound system from previous owner but im not very sure what brand is that  sounds still acceptable to me.but sometimes if i on too loud can hear the frame vibrating... so i thought maybe soundproofing will be a better choice,btohqsg
maybe try turn down bass first,btohqsg
However if you know of a good place in Malaysia  would be cheaper,btohqsg
i only go malaysia for tint bahaha,btohqsg
its on about 30% only 😅,btohqsg
You might want to get it tuned properly and turning the bass down. Usually if you upgrade sound system without dampening in jap or Korean cars  can hear a lot of vibrations and rattling,btohqsg
any good recommendation?my office carpark is open space area  lunch time i dont even want to drive out due to the heat.open door got heatwave one...,btohqsg
If you go for dampening  please don't cheap out as it can spoil your panels with the butile melting and make the situation worse in terms of audio quality,btohqsg
yeah but idk who to look for on such stuff,btohqsg
Tints will only help so much here,btohqsg
for these sg got infratint and rikecool,btohqsg
What you need is to use those folding windshield heat reflectors,btohqsg
but ya this is great when u park ur car,btohqsg
those dont help tho  i tried and still hot  maybe coz my car black colour.,btohqsg
Drown out the random knocking sound in your engine bay too,btohqsg
i did it for few months until i give up coz not much diff,btohqsg
Try foon audio garage  they're on the higher side in terms of pricing but very reliable,btohqsg
In that case  try opening your rear passenger window and turning on your aircon when you get in first,btohqsg
tbf i subaru so alw loose one,btohqsg
And then use your driver door as a fan and open-cloae it a few times,btohqsg
It sends out the hot air in your car,btohqsg
yeah i do that when i urgently need to use the car in afternoon  else i work till sunset then go home,btohqsg
but must open opp side window,btohqsg

We as in us having this convo,btohqsg
Well  if you can afford the higher maintenance,btohqsg
If you prefer very low maintenance cost,btohqsg
Make sure the unit in good condition,btohqsg
Heard a lot of nays on sirroco,btohqsg
A toyota can be a bad choice too if taken from the wrong person,btohqsg
You take care the car  the car take care of you,btohqsg
Edited my post for some eg,btohqsg
Yes because majority of the units not well taken care of,btohqsg
Altis would be a good choice ngl,btohqsg
Actuallt depends on what you want actually,btohqsg
You want a cheap everyday car,btohqsg
Ok c180 shouldn't be too bad if you PPI and make sure your unit is good. Maint cost not too high also,btohqsg
All depends on what you looking for,btohqsg
Good cars  can last long  drive point a to b with no frills,btohqsg
You want zhng or you just want a car for everyday use,btohqsg
Sgcm has some suggestions can check them out,btohqsg
jdm - hksconti - avantage or mbm,btohqsg
Can do PPI at cycle and carriage also,btohqsg
Usually they give a very high estimate,btohqsg
Cheap  reliable  good market to zhng,btohqsg
Which is good for you to nego,btohqsg
But realistically you don't need all of it,btohqsg
Basically look for overpriced workshop lol,btohqsg
But getting pricey for what it provides 🙈,btohqsg
I think there's a very nice frozen blue one coming up for sale,btohqsg
yeah owner upgrading to type r,btohqsg
U had one before? Saw a few coe cgi on sgcm. Depreciation also on par with jap,btohqsg
Know a few people who have  they're comfortable sedans just not the fastest,btohqsg
Want fast might want to go towards bmw,btohqsg
Imo fd2r not worth it lah,btohqsg
But harder to find stock and good units,btohqsg
if c200 not enough can js pay for basic tune at bms,btohqsg
No need fast.  Comfy and safe and abit if swagger can Liao,btohqsg
W204 c200 not bad if you can find a good unit,btohqsg
"yah my friend bought a COE toyota  every month keep entering workshop -.-""",btohqsg
Maintenance isn't too high compared to other jap cars,btohqsg
weirdly enough the most unreliable car my family ever own is a kia 🤣,btohqsg
C180 stock is 154bhp. Good enuff,btohqsg
really depends on how the previous owner maintains it,btohqsg
I would rather the w204 c class,btohqsg
CLA a bit dated looks and smaller rear,btohqsg
Good for 2 people and kids,btohqsg

Might as well go for NA.,btohqsg
u must get the high spec 1 for ventilated seat and sunroof,btohqsg
w204 proven to be reliable ❤️,btohqsg
Yes but c class still a better platform I feel  w204,btohqsg
Is there a w204 TG groupie  ?,btohqsg
More fun the drive a slow car fast than drive a fast car slow,btohqsg
This is the new generation already,btohqsg
Older C look abit uncle plus heavy,btohqsg
Can do AMG line kit not bad,btohqsg
And take c class to 200,btohqsg
Interesting  never seen the high spec unit,btohqsg
57k for a parf car left 7 years,btohqsg
Sorry ah this unit haven't sell for a long time until they do dealer paint job to white and put cla45 kit,btohqsg

Huuuh now 70k for 5 years?,btohqsg
Engine bay cover logo missing  usually a sign of running the car with no engine cover for a while,btohqsg
i think if u get the basic spec less 6k,btohqsg
You see the picture on tele,btohqsg
Then you see the picture after clicking,btohqsg
It's a useful glitch on sgcm,btohqsg
personal opinion ah but even interior w204 better,btohqsg
i mean i also didnt expect a korean car to be 70k @ 5 years hahha,btohqsg
Not worth for its price  they need to lower it,btohqsg
I wonder why you don't want him to buy,btohqsg

i just let it run on car battery,btohqsg
didn't buy the power pack. felt it was too expensive for a battery,btohqsg
Ah okay  does it really affect the car battery alot?,btohqsg
depends on ur car and battery u buy i guess,btohqsg
just that my car will pop out message battery discharge. varies from car to car honestly,btohqsg
cus my prev car doesnt pop out such message,btohqsg
only downside is u prolly change car battery quicker? maybe others last 2 years urs 1.5 years?,btohqsg
but please invest in 24hour parking monitoring.. cannot let hit and run idiots get away with such heinous crimes..,btohqsg
Yeah man... That's why trying to get it soon during this 11.11,btohqsg

I choose one of course nice hehe - E,btohqsg
But would it be a maintenance nightmare tho,btohqsg
But still I would get the car ASAP it looks like its in stunning condition,btohqsg
Only if got money lol 😭,btohqsg
I would prefer another 2 seater 🤫,btohqsg
I dont think so on this. The Air-cooled Porsches are too bad actually.,btohqsg
@Xipengadvise golf too. Gee the car is good. I got one with 138bhp  omg..good man,btohqsg
Fun to drive no doubt  pure joy,btohqsg
U advise me not to get sirrocco. Lots of maintenance issues,btohqsg
Having owned both... and pretty much all the pq35. The scirocco is the much better handling car. Sadly most are shagged to high hell  so its hard to find a decent example.,btohqsg
Maintenance wise... similar tbh. Just that the window actuator tends to fail on the rocs.,btohqsg
Likely trashed also. same fear when browsing for EG6. Sure trashed at some point of time.,btohqsg
So I start the engine  drive forward a bit,btohqsg
All enthusiast cars have been driven hard at some point or another. Its part of owning such vehicles. Most importantly is that chassis is straight   previous owner didnt cut corners on maintenance and preventative measures/maintenance were done. To me that is more important than a low owner count.,btohqsg
My golf only 51 k  lady driver. Mounting koyak i changed cost me 750,btohqsg

ya.. once owned it and loved it. 1 tank can reach 800 km  and can poke here and there also..😝,btohqsg
Ah I think xipeng suggest buy gti,btohqsg
No money I bot a 1.4 with 138 bhp,btohqsg
cos he once owned GTI before...,btohqsg
MK6 or 7? MK7 doesn't have intercooler..,btohqsg
Can la. No money drive Toyota. Have money drive lexus,btohqsg
Rline is nice come with digital cluster,btohqsg
Then the Toyota turns out to be Yaris GR,btohqsg
My golf only left 12 months,btohqsg
don't know why a lot of people hate vw.. quite a good car to me.. I love it..,btohqsg
Associated with Bengs bah  like Civic EG6 EK4 of yesteryears,btohqsg
where to see this from?is this a normal occurance? to have $1 COE 45mins before closing?,btohqsg
I used to have workshops sending the engine blocks to me to rebore the 1.4l to 2.0l. So the car is no more original 1.4l too many modifications by owners. So I stock to my Golf.,btohqsg
