I forgot who  but someone mentioned to me about why E30 is highly sought after unlike E36.https://youtu.be/KOQ0VHmzkbMNow this video explains why E30 is so popular.Jason cammisa now uploads car video into his own channel. üòç,btohqsg
did you know - the moidest e30 saloon can be easily converted into a m3? at least easily done with suspension components that can be swapped into the body. simply use the front control arms of the m3 and e36 Ti rear links  and you get a wider track e30 m3,btohqsg
the mix and match is so easily done - without drilling any hles nor mods,btohqsg
thisis a collector car. easy to maintain and repair. and great fun what a car should be. with just one motronic computer for fuel injection that is it. it is all skills to drive this machine.,btohqsg
anyone here went up north from sg yet (malacca/kl etc),btohqsg
So it is you Mr X. ü§£Well  I would say  E30 M3 is a heavily souped up BMW 2002 as compared to the rival brand new super over-engineered W201 ü§£,btohqsg
"""when your car reach a certain age  it is an antique. You are supposed to pull it off the road  clean it with super expensive microfiber towels  and preserve it for future generations.F*** THAT!"" -Jason CammisaüíØ Agree! These old cars have characters and always fun to drive.",btohqsg
E30 is comparable with model s actually not model 3,btohqsg
Model 3 is compare with usually the lower range like a 318 and such,btohqsg

But model s is heavy right. E30 is light. Very light. Like 1050 kg only.,btohqsg
to me is base on price point  and the status in the company  m3 4 5  are the signature car from bmw  and model s is like the signature of the company also  just like u dont compare a m3 with a c300  but u will compare it with a c63,btohqsg
i use e46 steering rack in my e30 . the weight is simply superb  significantly better than e30 steering and e36 rack which i had experimented. they are really cheap. only rm350.the e46 rack is a direct swap but the tie rods use back e30. this is the best steering weight for e30 so far.,btohqsg
i think BMW is one of the few who started component sharing that many others like japanse follow. for example  you can use 5 series components in 3 series (though not all). like brake booster can be shared for a greater brake pedal feel.,btohqsg
japanese follow last!. today we can see bezza switches that comes from toyota vios,btohqsg
better engine mounts (hydraulics filled with oil) from e36 can also be used in the e30. i am also using these.,btohqsg
and i also use the z3 short shifter on my e30. faster shifting. they are all interchangeable. just g buy these from engsoon.,btohqsg
Oh about sharing of parts.Porsche 924 is basically a VW parts bin car with a Porsche Badge. üòÇ,btohqsg
