Hi i got this serious question hope the learned shifu here can help to answer.My mother in law is born in 1958 while my mother is born in 1959.My mother in law had 77k in her RA at 55 and the 77k was straightaway transferred to cpf life when she was 55. she decided to start drawing her cpf life this year at 66yo. while at cpf appointment last week we were told that she can get 680 per month under standard plan and the capital of 77k will be exhausted in 9yrs. the cpf staff said that once money went into cpf life the interest is no longer yours so the capital that will be pass to beneficiary is based on 77k. i use cpf life estimator to see calculate and in order to get 680 per month the capital should be abt 120k. i compound 77k for 11yrs at 4% and i get abt 120k as well.my mother who turns 65 this year started her cpf life this year as well. she had 93k in her RA at 65 and is drawing 520 per month. her 93k in RA only go into cpf life this year when she started her cpf life payout. her 93k will only be exhausted after 15yrs.i realised my mother in law is being shortchanged because the money in her RA was transferred to cpf life at 55 while my mother is able to keep her RA money until 65 earning 10 yrs of interest. this resulted to a bigger capital which will only be depleted in 15 yrs instead of 9 yrs. the difference will come in if my mother pass on early as the money that will be inherited by her children including my wife will be lesser.may i know why is there such a disparity between people born in 1958 compared to ppl born one year later in 1959 pls?Thank you.,btohqsg
I think for both mother in law and mother.The CPF life interest no longer belongs to either of them. It will go to the common CPF pool upon their demise.Both mother and mother in law remaining principal sum will go to beneficiaries upon their demise.,btohqsg
I‚Äôll have a training conducted by US IT company for less than USD 3k  I check with heymax the mcc is 7399 or 5734.Since this will be in USD  will you suggest to use uob vs? I don‚Äôt think uob KF will cover that mcc. Or any other miles card will good for this situation,btohqsg
Check maybank horizon visa sig. 2.8mpd for fcy uncapped.,btohqsg
Shortchanged is a weird way of putting it  but I also always feels that I got short changed by govt as well as I paid more tax but always not eligible for any rebates etc. in any case  the reason is quite simple - Policy/calculation changed. Following not target at you but 1) Anybody who has money left when they pass away basically overworked.  2) Nine out of ten instances where I‚Äôve seen inheritance left (by folks who worked their entire life) to working adults  it‚Äôs spent on holidays  luxury items that the person who passed away couldn‚Äôt bear  to spend on themselves.,btohqsg

Hi Experts My Income Tax NOA just released and my first installment Giro is Aug 2024.So to use CardUp  the First Monthly Payment Date should be Aug 2024 or July 2024?Why I asked July 2024 is because we have to pay ahead of 6th Aug 2024?,btohqsg

Is anyone having issue with amaze card? Can't seem to change the tagged card,btohqsg
Maybe I got it wrongly. üòÖIt was a complicated progress that my friends were doing  but my CPU cannot process.,btohqsg
Took less than 24hours for me. Courier to deliver to me urgent basis. CSO was kind to arrange.,btohqsg
Can anyone advise the best card for big ticket items (e.g. luxury goods),btohqsg
UOB KF... but must spend $800 on SQ side,btohqsg
I‚Äôm having issues too. In JB now I can‚Äôt change to the Amaze wallet ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
I will swipe $1000 on CRMC  $2000 on UOB VS  $1100 on UOB PPV  and the rest on Vantage/PrviMiles/Prestige. For items $6k and below.I also used amex plat charge for my wife luxury goods because it‚Äôs covered by card insurance up to $10k per occurrence and $50k per year.,btohqsg
used to be simpler with Amaze + UOB KF  then amaze charge 1% above 1k haiz,btohqsg
Still worth it at 2mpd if you consider 1% = 1mpd.No other cards got so high mpd liao.,btohqsg
Back to this :Anyone used Maybank Card ?,btohqsg
For July I plan to get UOB lady and UOB one account but I am thinking which card I can get for now to clock 5.3 K flight with Lufthansa and Maximise MilesMost of them have cap spending UOB lady 2K   DBS Woman Card too,btohqsg
Uob krisflyer card is uncap 3mpd?,btohqsg
Try maybank horizon for flight i think,btohqsg
Great share! Quick question on point (2) regarding 2 trade transactions‚Ä¶ any minimum trade value? Any specific exchange to trade on eg. SGX or NYSE? Read the t&c but no clarity on the trades,btohqsg
Also Maybank is only FCY means I need to use European site and maybe get charged in other currency than SGD,btohqsg
Maybank can get 2.8mpd for airticket,btohqsg
Or use My DBS ALT using Vpn and European version of Lufthansa so I get 2.2 Mpd on foreign,btohqsg
Is therr min spend of 800 sgd/month to get that ?,btohqsg
Yes but i thought your ticket is already 5.3k?,btohqsg
2.8 mpd compare to 2.2 mpd,btohqsg
Aha so it count in that spending too,btohqsg
If book and posted in jun is 3.2 mpd due to limited time promo,btohqsg
So 3.2 MPD how that convert after to pool it to SIA ? maybe the conversion rate will be low ü§î anyone has used it before ?,btohqsg
I think you should do some reading up on the card,btohqsg
The rate is already as stated by mabybank lol. 3.2 mpd keep as maybank treat point. Minimum 10k krisflyer miles to convert,btohqsg
Starbuck app topup count towards card eligible spend?,btohqsg
IIRC mcc is 5814  so yes,btohqsg
Asking for advice  Whts the best way to remit sgd to myr for large sums? Thanks.,btohqsg
I'm trying to think of a simple credit card strategy for my wife  who's not the type to maximize rewards.Her spend is a lot of Grab rides  and the rest a mixed bag - online shopping  physical store shopping  some meals  occassional manicure etc.Any advice on whether this would generally work (other than a general use card)a. Use UOB ONE for all Grab ridesb. UOB VS for contactless  between $1K to $2K (accept occasional UOB merchant and $5 block issue)c. CRMC for all online spend  up to $1K,btohqsg
Cimb sg to cimb my  or maybank sg to maybank my  same bank is faster and less fee,btohqsg
Can try dbs remit or wise,btohqsg
Thanks and agreed its faster but the rates not competitive at times. :),btohqsg
Anyone knows if there is any metapay fraud on CRMC happening? I just received a charge and reversal on metapay that I don‚Äôt recall using any metapay before.,btohqsg
Thanks  but fees quite high for wise...,btohqsg
Ongoing issue with all banks and cards.It‚Äôs kind of random so no matter what u do it‚Äôs unavoidable. Unless u prepared to lock your cards all the time.,btohqsg
U will get flag either way if u transfering big amt  so bank is a better option in such case,btohqsg
Feel like not much use  as many people kena fraud charges even tho locked,btohqsg
My citi rewards card totally never use at all but kena fraud,btohqsg
Sorry  when you say flag  in what sense? as the fees?,btohqsg
Very common  lost count how many time i replace citi card already,btohqsg
When u remit over a certain amount often u have to explain if to third party. Unless is own bank sg to own bank my,btohqsg
I see  Surely for an legit purpose. Trying to see if there are better established ways or better fx rates available other than banks such as Wise or Panda remit.,btohqsg
Wise also will get stop at time over a certain amt,btohqsg
Yes  you are right. There is an limit for each service which needs to take note as well.,btohqsg
Got 3 of such last night. From Japan and Brazil. Raise dispute and new card on the way.,btohqsg
What are the whitelist MCC for HSBC,btohqsg

Anybody tried ocbc Paynow from another bank ?,btohqsg
Is there a way to check if I met the conditions of sign-on bonuses? (standard chartered simply cash credit card),btohqsg
Banks apply offline. Will be permanently until you cancel GIRO arrangement (another hassle  it took me 3 CSOs to find out the full GIRO details before you can submit through their online signing document - which most CSOs will not provide the correct link on first try - thanks outsourced CSOs without proper training),btohqsg
That‚Äôs scary! I pray my DBS cards are safe! Each DBS is GIRO to each of my EGA. üò≠üò∞Cannot imagine having to re-do all that!,btohqsg
That's not Apple Pay  but direct CC payment,btohqsg
Based on experience  haven't gotten any instance of fraudulent transactions on my DBS cards.,btohqsg
Be careful what u wish for üòè,btohqsg
My mind is blown apart alr üòÇ,btohqsg
I got it on my DBS WWMC last year üòÇ9 million viet dong dong chiang üòµüòµ‚Äçüí´,btohqsg
I change my card due to fraud. Do I need to redo my giro to hsbc ega?,btohqsg
After setup successfully  would be also good to cancel the GIRO arrangement with UOB.As usual  it takes about 3 working weeks to setup  so unless you are sure it's already changed  don't cancel the old arrangement.,btohqsg
I saw the 19 000 000 pop up on my ApplePay notifications I chuat sai üí©,btohqsg
Or you can just add in and save it as default on fairprice app. Don't waste the free 1k local transaction.,btohqsg
Can just be a transfer from different name.,btohqsg
All the points cns be access through yuu app. Remember to scan your yuu QR first before making payment so you get all the yuu points.,btohqsg
Sounds ok. If card limits reached ($2K + $1K) can consider adding UOB PPV or DBS WWMC.,btohqsg
Depends on the t&c. Best to check before spending.,btohqsg
Depends on what kind of spend and how you pay (online/contactless)  there are some alternatee. Crmc with amaze is the most notable one.,btohqsg
Usually dont have to  bank will reset up giro on the replacement card but u might miss 1 statement and need to manual pay,btohqsg
Why this message like familiar ah? ü§£,btohqsg
Interbank GIRO will auto? They so nice inform the debiting bank on the changes? ü§£,btohqsg
If Amaze is linked to CRMCAnd if i add Amaze into google wallet/google pay  its gonna work the same as though i had the physical card right?,btohqsg
Yes. I added mine to google pay and used per normal.,btohqsg
Thank you for the prompt reply üëç,btohqsg
any way to set the amaze tracking period same as the crmc statement period? currently its track via whole month whereas crmc its via the statement e.g. 17 jun - 17 jul,btohqsg
Why not the other way round?,btohqsg
any idea how to do it for citi?,btohqsg
didnt know it can be done  will try and update here :),btohqsg
Uob card replace before and they will send a letter that they will put the same giro arrangement on the replacement card but it will take time. I think citi just put reset giro on the replacement card as well when mine got replace,btohqsg
Anyone encounter problems adding this card to simplygo to view trip details?,btohqsg
Would anyone here recommend OCBC rewards card?,btohqsg
Hi  just checking if anyone still facing issue with using UOB Lady credit card via ApplePay? It still doesn‚Äôt works for me ‚òπÔ∏è,btohqsg
U can change crmc to 10th earliest,btohqsg
Yam I think Citi only got 3 statement date to choose when I request,btohqsg
Any use Citi PayAll. Does it earn it mpd?,btohqsg
Where can I get more info on the mpd for this,btohqsg
previously I did US stock buy trades and was eligible,btohqsg
Yes  good for online shopping like shopee Lazada,btohqsg
Hi when in overseas  for credit cards  do we pay in local currency or SGD better?,btohqsg
ya i use alot of shopee/aliexpress/taobaoi dont shop offline lol,btohqsg
When I call Citibank  cso say no need  and my bank statement show as it on giro. Not sure if have to or not.,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSG Hi gurus I recently noticed that one of comments from YouTube video mentions as below:‚ÄúThe catch for CPF SA Cash Top Up is untouchable at all. Eg. If u top 20k and reached 230k and say u reach 55yo now  with FRS of 200k  u can only allow to withdraw 10k.The 20k + the interest it compounded over the yrs are locked and is not considered part of FRS. Do think twice again or check thoroughly with CPF. I-only discovered it is not part of FRS at 55yo.‚ÄùNot sure if above mentioned comment is true ?May any Gurus here can clarify on it ?Thanks üôè,btohqsg
True  my dad enquired about this. Need to hit FRS less the accrued interest generated  meaning the base amount need to hit then can withdraw,btohqsg
Omg! Top up money + accrued interest are not consider part of FRS sum ?,btohqsg
The interest generated is not part of FRS sum to withdraw  top-up is ok,btohqsg
Someone can double check and confirm if possible?,btohqsg
How do we know how much is the base of our account currently ?,btohqsg
Untouchable as in reserved amount is not investable  doesn't mean it cannot be withdrawn. I've talked about it herehttps://youtu.be/LFw5xsHcdkU?si=lo3GciaIAq7nvFI5,btohqsg
last year 6k members  now 16k. nice,btohqsg

with the hsbc nerfing  whats the best fuss free miles credit card?,btohqsg
"I think the part on ""RSTU and its top-ups don't count"" is referring to this:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/187150Based on the commenter's 200k in mandatory contributions (and its interests)  he can definitely withdraw 20% from RA (see above link).Your RSTU and its interest will 100% be part of FRS  and it will 100% be used first to form your RA (unless you managed to do RSTU amounts above FRS  which is not possible since the cap for top-up to SA is FRS  including existing monies from mandatory contributions).Whether how much is withdrawable afterwards is a totally different conversation.The commenter has absolutely no idea what he's talking about.",btohqsg
Ok... Probably the 5th person sending this already..,btohqsg

Hi there  quick check does online payment qualify as eligible spend for HSBC T1 card? Any exceptions? Thanks!,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm been using Citi+amaze as my main spending card and if I spent over 1K  I use HSBC revolution as a backup.Im planing not to use revolution card. Should I change to UOB platinum visa or Citi premier miles?,btohqsg
UOB Preferred Platinum Visa and Citi Premiere Miles are 2 very different card.  One is 4mpd on contactless while the other one is 1.2mpd  general spending card.,btohqsg
Unable to advise on card as your qn is too generic. So many considerations. Eg. Card for what kind of spending etc ?,btohqsg
Which online payment? Cardup n ipaymy cant be used for hsbc t1 btw,btohqsg
For me  i using dbs wwmc for all online spending and the rest crcm + amaze.My spending abt 1.5-2k p/m. So i kinda of plan it. Usually use crcm til it reaches 700. Then i switch all online spending to dbs wwmc.,btohqsg
Do u use contactless alot? If yes  uob ppv is a good card to consider.,btohqsg
icic cause i realised amaze 1k limit refresh every 1st of the month but my crmc refresh every mid of the month,btohqsg
I have used ocbc Frank  dbs livefresh to buy taobao but only HSBC revolution charges DCC. Any ideas? Can this be waived?,btohqsg
Cant be waive  it just mean the payment is process overseas,btohqsg
OCBC Frank and DBS Live Fresh probably incorporated the fees in the final charge. You shouldn't pay FX directly using these cards anyway.,btohqsg
For taobao there‚Äôs no way to pay in other ccy now  only can pay in SGD  and the amount shown is the same as deducted on ocbc/dbs (no extra DCC)  dono why is it different for HSBC‚Ä¶,btohqsg
The company might have process different bank cc differently  i got charge for dcc for agoda on citi but not dbs,btohqsg

Very stupid question üòÖ For those cards that did not specific mobile contactless or excluded mobile contactless specifically (I.e. UOB One)  do I have to use the physical card in store? I am someone who uses Apple wallet for everything. üòÖ,btohqsg
If they specifically say need to be physical card then yes,btohqsg
Actually got such card meh? üòÇPretty much all cards award for mobile contactless right? ü§î,btohqsg
Thank you! Is there a list for cards that specifically mention the need for physical card (I.e citi rewards) or mobile contactless (i.e. UOB EVOL)?,btohqsg
Hi  if my DBS points are stated to expire in June 2024  does that mean I can apply to convert them to miles on the DBS website on the last day of the expiring month (30 June 2024)?

My Citi prestige application got rejected tho my salary is above 120k/yr. Currently holding Citi cards too.Can understand why?I‚Äôm holding other 120k cards like Amex plat  uob solitaire,btohqsg
does this mean Norton 360 Deluxe is not eligible,btohqsg
u have 5 citibank cards already?,btohqsg
Did you update your income with Citi?,btohqsg
when you say rejected  means they email you REJECTED?or not instantly approved?when i had 5 citi cards and i applied for Prestige  they didn't instant approve me. But they called me a few days later and told me to choose one card to cancel before approving the Prestige.,btohqsg
anybody have any idea on how to apply for DBS CC? my NOA is under 30k  due to starting work late last year. I kept getting rejected when using singpass   as it shows my NOA is under 30k. Thanks,btohqsg
then it could the income in Citi's record is below $120k as Oscar suggested.Get a credit limit review done before applying again.Make sure you try to snag a NEW TO CARD offer (Prestige does not need new to bank to get a signup offer),btohqsg
I‚Äôve applied for the DBS Altitude CC recently and got approved. I also started work less than 6 months ago. You could email them your latest 6 months computerised payslips & CPF contributions and that should work.,btohqsg
when applying using Singpass   did they show you NOA ? or u applied via the manual method ?,btohqsg
If i want to start investing now  what would be the best platform for small longterm investment of about $100 per month?,btohqsg
Applied using singpass didn‚Äôt have any issue. If u are lacking cpf contributions  you got to email them ur computerised payslips.explained here:https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/cards/cards-application-checklist.page,btohqsg
oh u said u working less than 6 months? means u started this year right?,btohqsg
Yes  i started working in early Feb  applied 2June and approved 4June. My cpf contributions for past 5 months was enough to show i earned >$30k so that was not an issue. You can just call their hotline or email them for clarification. T&Cs might differ for every individual.,btohqsg
ahh then we different case le  cause i was working since late last year then i got my income assessment which was less than 30k as it only calculates jan - dec 2024,btohqsg

To satisfy uob one cc $500 spend  can i top up ntuc gift card? Or top up qoo10 gift card?,btohqsg

Can check if wedding can be paid in smaller amount. Chris has a video bout that I think. If can  use 4mpd cards to maximize it.2nd thing  don't use amaze with prvi miles. It's actually better you use prvi miles overseas directly. Use amaze with UOB KF or other 4mpd cards.,btohqsg

No 2  technically only ur debit card but some dp said otherwise.No 3  you fill the physical forms of whoever you want to giro pay (dbs cc  iras income tax) and use HSBC acct as source of payment. Note: you need to register ur signature at physical hsbc branch first before setting up giro.,btohqsg
U need to really see mcc in this case then. But uob privi might be a safer bet  best if u have new to bank sign up spending requirement and try to clock it. If it is not excluded mcc.,btohqsg

Late may most likely only ready for Jul's statement  provided the statement generated is generated on the last day.HSBC will send an SMS when the GIRO arrangement is made but it does not mean deductions will be started then.,btohqsg
Only via HSBC Online Chat.Use 'Credit Card Standing Instructions' to setup GIRO to pay your HSBC CC with HSBC account (no cashback).For GIRO arrangements  use 'Chat with Agent' to chat with CSO. It may take you about half an hour to an hour and a couple of CSOs to find out your GIRO arrangements for your HSBC accounts.,btohqsg

Hi gurus Assuming I am using 25years HDB loan  is it a wiser choice to pump in some cash upfront to lower to loan amt so that the monthly mortage is lower? Or just leave it and  use cpfThe thing is if leave it  the loan amt will require me to pay a few hundred each month on top of the cpf deduction,btohqsg
1) If i am keen to slowly (dca) buy into etf reit  which broker is the best to use/hold2) shld i invest in CLR or syfe reit+,btohqsg
if you dont pay cash upfront  what do you intend to do with it?,btohqsg
With risk free rates higher than hdb loan  it's a no brainier to just keep the hdb loan as it is and to slowly pay back. Furthermore if you are willing to take some risk  you can potentially get much higher returns with your spare cash which you are contamplating to lower your loan quantum.,btohqsg
Worth it to put 125k in uob account? Or just 100k is ok?,btohqsg
Assuming uob one acct  can put as close to 150k as possible. Interest rate between 100k and 125k is 4.5% pa. If your other investments have lower yield than that  better put in uob one.,btohqsg
Definitely find ways to invest and like what Dy mentioned  find those risk free investment,btohqsg
As of now I haven‚Äôt done much research on those risk free investments but definitely not going to leave it idle. Just not sure if it‚Äôs wise to pay some cash upfront to lower the mortgage,btohqsg
But thank you for the confirmation. Any recommendations on risk free investment to recommend me to read further?,btohqsg
once you pay off  you cannot cash out anymore. so try to do research to get better returns and if you are ok with the risk/reward then go ahead. you maintain dome degree of liquidity compared to paying off,btohqsg
Can watch this video and read the comments  then make your own decisionhttps://youtu.be/o6ysdb_LGeU?si=kEkg_1PUsxZn3C1J,btohqsg
Have watched your video already! Just wanna hear out some guru‚Äôs opinion üòÖ,btohqsg
Wow okay! Definitely some quality advice here. Liquidity,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth since the yield out there is definitely more than your hdb loan interest amount.Relatively low risk investment with certain degree of liquidity  you can look into money market funds or even syfe guaranteed. Even bank interest rate are generally higher interest,btohqsg

I will put 150k in the UOB one account. This will act as my emergency fund. If need to  I can draw down. The benefit is you are still getting reasonable good returns and the fund is liquid.,btohqsg

Thank you so much for the info :)Hopefully it will be in time for July statement (mine is on 18th) as otherwise I‚Äôll miss out on the 1% for my big ticket CC payments,btohqsg
Tight. Maybe you might want to ask DBS to change to end of month. Makes more sense also  the statement will align with the calendar month.,btohqsg
Thanks Melvyn! I‚Äôll give DBS a call to change the statement date to month end hopefully in time for the giro to be setup for EGA,btohqsg
Digibot will do. They won't entertain change statement month through phone  and you need to make any outstanding payments first.,btohqsg
Thanks again! I‚Äôll do through digibot then  but do I need to make outstanding payment for current statement now before request for date change? Or I can also change date first and make payment beginning of next month? Usually I pay my bills on day 1/2 of the month,btohqsg
You might want to reread my text.,btohqsg
Thanks and got it  I‚Äôll make payment first :)Hopefully the statement date change will be effective Jul instead of Aug,btohqsg
O yes  1% is charged by amaze. Saw the message Citibank link with amaze only. ü•≤,btohqsg

Need a card to replace my hsbc revo that my wife is using. Monthly spending around 1-3k depends. Mostly on online shopping (shopee/amazon/tiktok) & offline shopping (groceries/guardian/watson/etc) / food & ride hailing + delivery.Am looking at uob ppv and krisflyer.Any thoughts?,btohqsg
My spendings are mostly online. I use CRV and crmc mostly. Bigger items Dbs wwmc. Offline spendings I use amaze + crmc.Prefer Citi because better transfer partners and no $5 block nonsense like UOB,btohqsg
This is my current setup. She doesn‚Äôt want to have cards under her name as she dont believe in cc. So thats why i apply since she spending that amount almost monthly and get nothing out of it for so long.,btohqsg
Wah. Then ppv is best for offline shopping(paywave) or vs if exceed 1kNot sure what other cards are good for online though.,btohqsg
How much is the cash shortfall?,btohqsg
Never ever repay your HDB housing loan unless no choice (e.g. upgrade house)It is the CHEAPEST and LONGEST term loan you can ever obtain in your life.,btohqsg
jus max out ur cpf  whatever goes into ur OA monthly put into the loan  cash outlay minimal as u can get better interest outside with ur cash  even ssb tbill bettercpf no point not maxing out since if it stays in OA get 2.5% while ur loan accruing 2.6%,btohqsg
Yea. That‚Äôs why im looking at krisflyer as well. 3mpd uncapped just that need to spend 800 on SIA/Scoot/KrisShop within the year,btohqsg
UOB PPV is a good candidate. it can also be used online for a whitelist of MCCs. Lazada and shopee are within PPV whitelist for online. Not sure tiktok and amazon. Food delivery is included too. Ride hailing is not.,btohqsg
why not just keep hsbc revo for your online shopping like shopee/amazon? then get ppv just for offline,btohqsg
Sir  you forgot CPF OA can be used to buy Tbills.so i would try to pay AS LITTLE HDB LOAN repayment as possible (max the tenor so each month's instalment is minimum). So as much CPF OA as possible is left in your account to buy CPF Tbills.Of course one day when CPF Tbills are no longer viable (below 2.6% p.a.) then by all means use your CPF to reduce/repay the HDB loan.,btohqsg
My wife is not like me  have few cards for diff usage. She likes those 1 card cards wonder and no fuss.,btohqsg
Well. She is helping me to get more points. So i have to accommodate to her,btohqsg
"if you save all online platform with hsbc revo  technically she doesnt need to enter the card details every time? then just add ppv to her apple/android. what is she ""managing""? to pay the bills?",btohqsg
in this aspect  she doesn't need to decide which card to use also? since all online platform already has her hsbc revo  just need to check out. for all offline  you open your apple/android wallet  only got 1 card there which is ppv.,btohqsg
if that is the case  online all use crmc and offline all use uov ppv (add to apple pay/google pay). Set up once and forget about it.,btohqsg
Thats all for the feedback. Let me talk to my wife. Hope she ok with 2 diff cards.,btohqsg
you just tell her more miles = more free flights  maybe can work ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
just tell her that you will set up everything for her. You add crmc to all online portals. Then add PPV to apple pay. Then she needs to use only  no need to think.,btohqsg

I think Tiger is not supporting fractional trades. Is my understanding correct ? If so  what‚Äôs the east way for 5x buy trade with lower cost?,btohqsg
I received it too. Trying to compare this with my UOB Absolute Cashback AMEX credit card. Also 1.7% cashback.,btohqsg
uob absolute less exclusion but Amex less widely accepted,btohqsg
Then maybe better than UOB Absolute cos AMEX not so widely accepted in SG,btohqsg
Have successfully applied Maribank Credit Card with Singpass. Also ordered the physical card and activated it for Google Pay use. Yes it is Mastercard. So I am gonna stop using my UOB Absolute Cashback AMEX card for now and cancel it in 2 months time once all the cashback has been factored into my next CC bill.,btohqsg
I can stop my Citibank Cashback+ Mastercard too since Citibank is only 1.6% cashback.,btohqsg
Isn't UOB Absolute also 1.7% cashback?,btohqsg
Every dollar spend  $0.10 different compare to 1.7%?,btohqsg
Disadvantage of UOB is AMEX only. Some places do not accept AMEX. Then I always resort to Citibank Cashback+ Mastercard with 1.6%This new Maribank CC is like a combination of both Citibank Mastercard 1.6% and UOB AMEX 1.7%.,btohqsg
Yall might want to just look at DCS Platinum Master.. 2% no min spend (though capped at $200/month but that's like $10k spend  if you are spending that kind of money per month you should be looking at other stuff alr),btohqsg
My wife has the DCS card 2% üòÖ. We diversify our cashback cards. Our strategy.,btohqsg
Hi experts  my work requires me to spend money on courses for continuing education once/twice a year. Just checking that Amex TCB would be the most suitable card to use? Only have EVOL at the moment which will change to One which shouldn‚Äôt cover course fees. Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
It‚Äôs different education provider everytime depending on what is available so some may not,btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt noticed one that state that they don‚Äôt accept it yet. But are there other cards that does not exclude education fees? How about professional membership fees etc?,btohqsg
Do your own filter. After that can email them.,btohqsg
maybank cards like platinum visa or barcelona,btohqsg
Are we able to add amaze to Apple Pay?,btohqsg
Thank you! I‚Äôve just checked maybank platinum visa and it requires monthly minimum spend for the entire quarter to be able to get cash back. The course fees are more of a once off hundreds to thousands once or twice a year only.,btohqsg
Hello! I just applied for a Citi rewards card and am wondering if I will be deemed a ‚Äònew citi card member‚Äô. I cancelled my previous Citi card more than 1 year ago but there was some leftover charges which I only paid off 11 months ago,btohqsg
think they can actually cancel the card after u paid off the bill less annual fee if any?,btohqsg
I was only a few weeks away from the one month mark but didn‚Äôt realise that I had leftover charges after cancellation :(,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGIs there any video or article analysis on shall a CPF member participate CPF Life based how many years the members can withdraw the fund since the return/interest generate will go into common pool versus keeping minimum in CPF life - basic  n self invest CPF with higher return.Another scenario:Eg. If a member expect to live till 73 years old  shall the member choose basic or escalating. How much interest is not recoverable from common pool etc.,btohqsg
I do not have one but here's a pretty good walkthrough by Providendhttps://youtu.be/tu9p1Nvfl1U?si=47vPNi1paVPSf4SK,btohqsg
Do anybody know this card? How is it?,btohqsg
This can be big problem my colleague had the same problem then went to lowest credit rating banned from applying cards,btohqsg
Ok card but there are better options at 120k mark. I think can use to pay education and earn miles.,btohqsg
I see. Thanks very much! I have CITI Presitage already  I think this UOB card is not worth applying?,btohqsg
You already had citi prestige  one of the better 120k cards. What is the appeal of UOB VIM to you?,btohqsg
it's more metal than Citi Prestige ü§£,btohqsg
I don't know actually üòÇüòÇ. That's why i asked u all.,btohqsg
I think the $25 transfer fee (as long as you transfer large chunks) isn't too onerous.Personally I think UOB might be more limiting than Citi because you can only transfer to SIA & Cathay Pacific? It looks like redemption from EVA Air to Star Alliance (SIA) is cheaper according to this article:https://suitesmile.com/blog/2024/03/18/cheapest-ways-to-fly-between-singapore-and-europe-using-miles-points-from-singapore-cards/,btohqsg
How about HSBC Infinite compared to Citi Presitage? I found that what I needed most is unlimited Lounge & Airport pickup service. But the HSBC has the cheaper annual fee,btohqsg
Ask what do u want the card for? Lounge? Hotel stay? Accor plus? Personally lifestyle CC amex plat charge is quite good.,btohqsg
Are you hsbc premier client? Cuz hsbc af is 662.,btohqsg
Wow  let me check about the amex,btohqsg
Do you use citi 4nf? I find earn rate of hsbc is very lackluster. And you cant earn much with hsbc revo being nerfed to the ground. And hsbc excluded cardup transactions.,btohqsg
I used once and found that not  cheaper than other websites,btohqsg
for HSBC VI and HSBC T1 at least.,btohqsg
I see. That's so hard to choose üòÇüòÇ. I use cardup for my rentals & income taxes. Lounge and Airport Pick-up services r also my strong demands. No need for golf.,btohqsg
I know less about ocbc. May I know this premier is like HSBC premier or a card name?,btohqsg
there is basic ocbc voyage (1.3 mpd) and ocbc premier voyage (1.6mpd but ocbc premier customer only). The rest of the benefits are similar. Unlimited lounge access (no guest)  spend 12k per quarter for 2 limo rides.,btohqsg
Its advantage is less annual fee than citi prestige?,btohqsg
coz it's a visa card  right?,btohqsg
yes. even better if you can get premier voyage for 1.6mpd,btohqsg
i see. let me go to learn more about the details. thank you  guy!!!,btohqsg
Anybody facing error with logging in HSBC app too?,btohqsg
No. You either apply through singsaver or hsbc promo link. Choose your preferred reward accordingly,btohqsg
for citi rewards + amaze pair  can we add amaze card to apple pay and use contactless?,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt add amaze to Apple. Every day sure got someone ask this,btohqsg
means have to use physical card to tap?,btohqsg
Yes or you buy an android just to add amaze to the wallet,btohqsg
1). Is unlimited free 1 guest of lounge pass important to you?2). Earn miles from Cardup/iPaymy important to you ?,btohqsg
The thing u got to note is.Most people don‚Äôt put their usual spending on prestige or HSBC visa infinite due to the low earn rates.Prestige allows you to clock spending quickly using Citi payall especially during payall promos. This is the biggest win prestige has over HSBC visa infinite,btohqsg
1). not important now coz just broke up  hahaha.2). i think yes  coz i paid my tax & rentals via Cardup. I will earn lots of miles from them,btohqsg
2). If I am not mistaken  HSBC infinite exclude 7399 which is used by Cardup/iPaymy.,btohqsg
I see. that's hard to try. I am lost in limo rides  but this needs 12k transaction on citi in one Q. I might have chance to get it only in tax season,btohqsg
Look at the categories that Citi payall supports. It is very comprehensive.,btohqsg
During tax season  how do you use HSBC infinite to earn miles n get free limo?,btohqsg
However nowadays payall even with promos may not be worth it anymore unless one has some strategies to further reduce the cost of miles acquisition,btohqsg
It seems can not earn miles on HSBC. HSBC has 4 free limo per year itself,btohqsg
tbh hard to earn miles on hsbc. Earn rate for hsbc vi is bad among gen spend card. hsbc revo nerfed badly. No cardup or ipaymy.,btohqsg
Hi all  for credit card limit review  say if I have cards approved for a New Bank in May  I believe this will cause an increase to my overall unsecured credit limit.If I plan to apply for credit limit increase for my existing cards with DBS now  does having new credit limit with New Bank affect chances of DBS reduce my credit limit?I have credit limit increase approved for DBS cards in May but I was foolish to set my own limit instead of letting bank decide the limit for me  and now having second thoughts about letting the bank decide the limit for me instead.So should I still proceed to apply for credit limit increase with DBS or better don‚Äôt change it for the time being?,btohqsg
in my experience  your limit with another bank does not affect dbs and vice versa,btohqsg
Free Limo is not so important to me perhaps. About $16 per trip. Total about $64 only.,btohqsg
my cab ride to airport is 25-30 leh üôÅ,btohqsg
Thanks Anthony!So if I already have my CL increase approved last month (with the limit I set)  there‚Äôs no harm to apply for another CL increase this month and let the bank decide CL for me  is this correct?,btohqsg
I see. I just compared between the rights card,btohqsg
i just reread your original message. I think can leave ur dbs limit for now as you just changed it so recent.,btohqsg
How do u get $16? I think each time I call a grab  it needs at least $20,btohqsg
I think 1 guess free is important. Some restaurants are quite expensive. You need credits from two passes ($67) for 1 person meal.,btohqsg
Usually I will go early n lounge hopping. I  choose off peak to go airport. many hours early. Avoid peak.,btohqsg
Oh  i reliesed that hscb just have 1 person free for lounge  right?,btohqsg
Even after 12am?And normal taxi can fit 3-4 luggages?,btohqsg
I seldom take flight after 12am. Usually I one person take flight. But for restaurants  I need two passes $67 for 1 person meal.,btohqsg

how much is the big ticket item? paying online/offline? which mcc/merchant?,btohqsg
Using the app at your credit card page  belowView StatementsBalance TransferView MoreThere's a short horizontal grey bar. Pull that down to reveal all the info you need.,btohqsg
omg thanks it‚Äôs helpful didn‚Äôt know that existed!! may i also ask why is it that i paid my CC bill and then the next day the transaction is gone?? sorry for asking a basic qn cuz hsbc app looks sooo diff from the other banks apps.. how do i check that my cc bill has been paid?,btohqsg
Depend on where you stay. Maybe stay at Pasir Ris less than $15.,btohqsg
I use amaze+citireward to pay for NordVPN but I not happy with it and ask for refunds. It refund to the Amaze wallet only and not to the credit card.,btohqsg
Cc is slower by few days from what I experience paying amaze+crmc,btohqsg
I don't know if we are using the same app or looking at the same page... I can scroll thru past cc transactions up till Mar 2023.,btohqsg
They changed it? I have gotten refunds from amaze and it always go to the credit card even if i put wallet as link type when the refund is processing  it go back to the original payment method last timeSo like that if wan to top up wallet with cc can jus buy somethting on lazada or shopee and cancel immediately?,btohqsg
Did you paid using amaze linked to credit card  but changed to wallet and then request for refund? If yes  this is potentially a loophole. LolBut then... I don't see much use case or potential of abuse for this cos we can easily top up w/o fees using bank transfer.,btohqsg
Based on multiple data points  refunds have been and will always go back to wallet. But what's the point of doing that? It's additional effort and the FX spread is higher for linked card.,btohqsg
Hi  I am setting up giro for HSBC EGA. Can I pay my wife's credit card bills via giro? Or does it need to be the same name then can?,btohqsg
i spend sgd and refund sgd then no fx spread? i usually top up my wallet around 200 a month for spend in malaysia and if i can pay the 200 later during cc bill vs immediately via paynow or bank transfer of course paying later is better,btohqsg
Hi. May I check for clocking EVOL's contactless payment  is buying Fairprice/Fraser voucher over the counter considered?,btohqsg
Mine has always been to cc,btohqsg
I just use it as it is since I already earn mile from the credit card.,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt remember. Maybe I did link to wallet or change to another card afterward.,btohqsg

If I set a recurring payment to amaze + credit card  but I have more than one linked card w amaze  does the monthly deduction use the same linked card all the time or I need to take note of the deduction date and toggle the card to be used in amaze app accordingly ?,btohqsg

Is my first time getting a credit card for earning miles. My huge payment is insurance and carloan which i know both can use cardup to make pymt,btohqsg
Same  trying to find the best wawayy to,btohqsg
I see citipayall is 2.2 or something,btohqsg
Oh  citipayall can use to pay insurance?,btohqsg
Yup  same have fees. But I hate how their website have the lack of transparency of showing how much is the fee. Keep trying to find it but can‚Äôt. Then I rmb seeing it somewhere to be 2.2% but I can‚Äôt be 100% sure.,btohqsg
Discussed about citi payall here and relevant cost vs benefits.Will be doing an insurance version soonhttps://youtu.be/B3zlAL32UY8?si=B12mG7OKmgXtwhwr,btohqsg

Amaze + Citi rewards  can use for SP bills? Will have 4mpd? May I ask?,btohqsg
does this work? thought it is treated as non-transferable balance,btohqsg
I think the person meant top up shopee with youtrip card. Once the money is in shopee  you can transfer to bank account.,btohqsg
if the money is treated as non-transferable balance by shopee  it cant be withdrawn to bank account right? or am i missing something here?,btohqsg
Youtrip is debit card so it shouldnt go to shopee non transferrable balance. Thats in theory but i havent done it myself.,btohqsg
"my past experiences topping up from these ""prepaid"" cards (they are not officially debit cards) are their balances are usually treated as non-transferable  would need a dp to confirm though",btohqsg

A few things. Watch shop mcc (5944) is not under UOB lady fashion. Second  10mpd only when you have 100k in UOB saving  which isn't recommended. And third  Rolex most likely burst 1k/2k cap of UOB lady.,btohqsg
Ah yes  I totally forgot about cap! Thank you!,btohqsg
yes  there will be an additional section for supp card,btohqsg
Can i check using uob ppv and uob vs for shell and spc.Uob ppv get 0 mpdUob vs get 3.6mpd?,btohqsg

With 100k  should I put it in OCBC 360  clock salary bonus  incremental bonus and spending bonus of 4.60% or put them in SSB ~3% for 10 years?,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 is better. Higher interest and better liquidity.,btohqsg
"Only hassle is you must make sure the incremental $500 saving into your OCBC account every month. It is best not to have any ad-hoc withdrawal in case you affect the MAB. Once a while  you need to ""reset"" it",btohqsg

Ic... Has your fund been earmarked?,btohqsg
For UOB rising dragon promoAfter I signup  can I move out fund from one account then move back in 2 days later?,btohqsg
it gets even worse with the latest plunging chicken promo due to the fact they have an EXPLICIT clause.. funds withdrawn and redeposit within last 30 days,btohqsg
Did you read the definition of fresh funds?,btohqsg
But I accidentally transfer in this morning before signing upSo it‚Äôs kinda less then 12 hrsSince the terms and condition say MAB from March 2024‚Ä¶I have transferred out Liao,btohqsg
to give you some comfort.. SOMETIMES.. banks can say something in black and white.. but they don't enforce or UNABLE to enforce due to system constraints.see whether you want to take the risk or not. And if you don't get earmark  are you ok with just 4% p.a. interest on your $150k (fail to get the cash bonus),btohqsg
You transferred out on Feb 29?,btohqsg
Nope. I just want to top up fresh new 20k on top of my existing cash in one account,btohqsg
These 20k part of any of your UOB accounts from 1 Mar onwards?,btohqsg
Nope. It‚Äôs in DBS account. Butttt ‚Ä¶ I made the mistake of transferring it in this morning before signing upSo it‚Äôs less then 12 hrs,btohqsg
I seriously doubt (but don't take my word as 100% correct) UOB will / able to look at INTRADAY funds in/out and use that for enforcing the withdraw and re-deposit rule.If i were to build UOB system  I would at most look at end of day balances to see if any were withdrawn and redeposit.so u agar agar,btohqsg

actually if you already 'accidentally' transfer in the $20k... you can just register the same day.. and don't do anything liaowhy u go and move the $20k back out again?,btohqsg
Because I thought the the fresh fund in need to be after we sign up right?,btohqsg
no ah.. the plunging chicken TNC off the back of my head isfresh fund in date or registration date  WHICH EVER LATER...,btohqsg
Now only scared your 20k not part of fresh funds already.,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 account holders who transfer out their pay on payday  does it say on the web browser salary credited already before the transfer out ? Read that it should be done by 9pm on pay day   still seeing 0.00 under salary credited...so can go ahead ? Or wait ....,btohqsg
"1.6(iii). ""30 days before and during the Promotion period""",btohqsg
Has it been at least 1 business day?,btohqsg
indeed written in black and whitebut it is really ridiculous and i don't see how they can enforce it to the letterwhat about salary crediting (condition of bonus interest)? if i transfer out my salary on the day i receive.. HOW?,btohqsg
No...credited today at 4+pm. So@MelvynEzi  need to wait to see the amount reflected under Salary credited first before transferring it out ?,btohqsg
ü§£ü§£ I mean it has been there for previous promos  maybe they cannot enforce it,btohqsg
I always withdraw on the same day. It will be captured as long as the salary is in,btohqsg

Anyone knows if the hsbc ega July promo is out? What‚Äôs the % rate,btohqsg
Hi like to check on the hsbc ega.Im currently on May promotion (not june promotion) and it will end this month on sunday.If i will to transfer to 2nd hsbc ega account (under Jun promotion)  will it be the best to transfer this sat or next Mon?As hsbc have cap of $250k  will need to do more than once.Also if i do it on next Mon 1st July  will the transfer amt consider as the 1st day of July amount and affect my sign up of the July promotion (will 1st July intended transfer amount affect the fresh funds consideration etc for Aug deposit back)Thanks,btohqsg
In other words  to do the 2 accounts method  shld i do it on last day of the month or first day of the month. Any difference esp this month end is on sunday,btohqsg
Search from a list of referrals at@sgpromocode,btohqsg
This month end is on a sunday.If i do a fast transfer on sunday   it will be consider a monkey transfer. On the daily transfer limit  the amount is based on Monday or it will still consider as sunday daily limit,btohqsg
Hi all  I saw HSBC EGA need to perform 5 transactions however I have not received my hsbc debit card yet. The account just open this Monday. Can I use the credit card to perform 5 transaction instead? I have revolution cc,btohqsg
Yes can. Or you can transfer 1 dollar out to another bank acct 5 times.,btohqsg
Yes. Or it is called FAST,btohqsg

Yes. I transferred to my own dbs  acct.,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say I transfer in 50k does it over ride the 20k I transfer out?,btohqsg
Start moving your funds out from HSBC A into outside bank now such that 29th June 9am it would be left with $2k only.Start moving funds from outside bank Account into HSBC B from 1st July onwards.,btohqsg
Nobody will know since Uob added this funny 30 days thing recently only.But if strict interpretation. It will not override. Will deem as $30k fresh funds only strictly.,btohqsg
It will be compared against ur march MAB so 30k fresh fund,btohqsg
His $20k was in/out in June. lol,btohqsg
But the 20k was transferred in and out just today,btohqsg
Also if I submit the form today Liao  do I need to transfer in by 29 June?,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt do anything on weekends. Do before,btohqsg
Caution on weekends. Just do it latest tomorrow.,btohqsg
What if I transfer on 1 st July?I assume I just need to register the form by 29june right?,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt July not in the participation period alrd? How do you transfer in on 1st July,btohqsg
He wanna take part in plunging chicken season 2,btohqsg
Then that makes even more no sense  how to fill up the form when the next plunging chicken not even out,btohqsg
He have to fill up new form Loh,btohqsg
He said fill up form on 29 June lol,btohqsg
If follow t&c strictly  transfer out matters already,btohqsg
That one disqualified since criteria not met. Then fill up new Loh,btohqsg
Yea la  that‚Äôs why I said it doesn‚Äôt make sense in what he‚Äôs trying to do,btohqsg
Still feel ridiculous. How can anyone have account with no fund movement for 30 days one,btohqsg
Thanks. But just to understand if i move only on Mon 01Jul and left 2k. Will it not be the whole month of July as only 2k too?,btohqsg

U said u more than $250k right,btohqsg
Yes. But whats the impact if there is a new promo for July (July and Aug  and i sign up for Aug). if i will do it on 29Jun - $250K   and rest on 30Jun and 01Jul?,btohqsg
Ok so what about 29Jun before 9am 250k and 01Jul $250K  will the 01Jul 250K impact the July/Aug promo   if i were to only transfer back to this account on Aug?,btohqsg
If u have already made up your mind you can go ahead.I‚Äôm telling u the method which I know will work 100% and won‚Äôt fail in case system maintenance or you fall sick on one day.I always like to be kiasu and kiasi and don‚Äôt do just in time or last minute.,btohqsg
Not that i made up my mind  I was thinking if it will not impact the Aug interest (assume July promotion cover july and aug sumilarly like Jun promo) then putting 2 more days on 29 and 30th jun did have a quite a difference. But just want to make sure transfer out on 1st July shld not have any impact when transfer back in Aug on the interest based on fresh funds etc,btohqsg
Need to pay USD3000 online with MCC5734  what is the best card for miles? I am thinking- UoB KF+Amaze- HSBC T1 apply and get 30k miles- anything you else  except MaybankI will not spend this regularly,btohqsg
You have 500k in HSBC EGA? Anything above 360k significantly drops the EIR because of the cap on the 1% bonus interest from Everyday+ Rewards.,btohqsg
You can try this as a JIT warrior. But like what Mt said  if for some reason there's downtime in HSBC banking services and you end up having 250k stuck on 1 Jul  it'll affect the bonus interests on both accounts for Jul and Aug.,btohqsg
Hi what is the advantage of getting a credit cardwith amaze vs getting a trust card or YouTrip card for overseas travel. Why is the earlier option better ?,btohqsg
Have you watched Chris' video on the best multi-currency cards for overseas travel spend?,btohqsg
Do you accumulate miles through spending? If yes  you will easily figure out the answer to your question. Otherwise  stick to multi-currency cards,btohqsg
Does MCC 5812 qualify for 4mpd on CRMC? Payment was made through Apple Pay (not mobile contactless).,btohqsg
No. You gotta make payment online for crmc. Crmc explicitly excludes mobile wallet (Google pay/apple pay) from earning pts. Remove your crmc from ur apple pay üòÖ.,btohqsg
Yup im aware of the $300 cap. I have no other better options.,btohqsg
Use cc online directly  so without Apple Pay.,btohqsg
Maxed 150k on UOB One for 4% p.a.? As well as utilising the earmark promo for additional 2% p.a.?Based on chat history  seems like you already have that  and OCBC 360  and e-Saver.,btohqsg
As long as i transfer out on 01Jul then no issue correct. Ok noted. Thanks,btohqsg
Yes. Ocbc also and e-saver used it in May,btohqsg
For payment in store using FairPrice apps  ShopBack or Fave  can I link the apps to my Citi rewards card to earn 10x?  Or link to my amaze card which is paired with my citi rewards card? Tks,btohqsg
For the excess monies  maybe you can look into t-bills/FDs when promo rates drops below 3.5%.,btohqsg
As long not excluded  most of these apps will be online spend.,btohqsg
Yes have been doing that. Thanks again for the information shared here.,btohqsg
So instore payments using apps will be considered as online spending ?,btohqsg
Thanks! So long as don‚Äôt need tap terminal is considered  online spend,btohqsg
Hi gurus  any idea for NTUC link membership  what credit card allows me to earn rewards from this monthly payment? Scrolled through the chat but could not find much info.,btohqsg
Try to get access to multiple humans so u can have more than one copy of a good account.For example in a household appoint one finance minister who takes care of cash management and able to control (with approval of course) the good accounts of the humans inside the household. Very efficient and effective.,btohqsg
hi gurus  i applied for hsbc travel1 due to welcome miles. Paid for tcm using card  and the amount would later on be reimbursed to me (not hsbc card but to another bank of mine) by my PA insurance. Would the transaction still be qualified then? Right now the points for the transacted is recorded lah but idk if that will meet qualified spend to qualify for welcome miles thanks!! üôèüèª,btohqsg
If refund goes to another card it won‚Äôt affect the original spend,btohqsg
Of course it will qualify as long as MCC accepted. Who reimburse you the bank won‚Äôt know,btohqsg
Quite turn off when I see need to pay annual fee for the welcome miles,btohqsg
Calculate if it is cheap Loh. If it is below 1.3 cents it is good deal actually.,btohqsg
Some food for thought. To get 30k miles you need to spend 7.5k sgd on 4mpd. Will take 7-9 months depending on how much you spend.196 AF for 30k means you are buying 1 mile at 0.65cents. KF mile is easily worth 1-1.25 cents each. Close to 2 cents if you choose biz class.Again not financial advice and do what you see fit.,btohqsg
Pair it with EGA and it's a lower cost if u think about it,btohqsg
Hi gurus  does ‚ÄúQualifying Spend‚Äù for sign-up bonus include foreign retail transactions? Or do only local transactions count?,btohqsg
Wasn't mentioned. Says ‚Äúany retail transactions (including internet purchases)‚Äù. but would like to be sure,btohqsg
If I have multiple UOB credit card  will all UNI$ rewards go to the same account ?,btohqsg
Can ask why 1.3 cent is considered good ? Like what Anthony mentioned hahaha it‚Äôs close to Biz at 2cents,btohqsg
UOB credit card points are pooled,btohqsg
Press rewards+ and u can see how ur points are credited,btohqsg
2 cents per mile is like biz saver rate. If you are redeeming biz advantage or econ  the value is lower. 1.3 cents is a good number for comparing.,btohqsg
Is oversea car rental consider as travel category for UOB lady?,btohqsg
If the UNI$10 per $5 spend calculated on block of $5 ?,btohqsg

For the singsaver 20$ how to get the application reference number to fill up the singsaver form? Cant find it in the submission UI and also didnt get any application record as email,btohqsg

Are platforms likeTrip.comagoda   etc. considered as travel category?,btohqsg
Which card? Different cards have different definitions for travel category.,btohqsg
Then yes. For uob lady  can compare against mcc provided and heymax mcc lookup.,btohqsg
Oh ya travel cat doesnt have explicit mcc in TnC.,btohqsg
Thats why I‚Äôm confused  no mcc,btohqsg
Many cards exclude these travel agencies,btohqsg
Yes. Official tnc doesnt have mcc for travel but community has figured out online and offline travel agencies (4722) are under uob lady travel.,btohqsg
