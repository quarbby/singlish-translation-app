Didnâ€™t ur previous one ran out of storage ?,btohqsg
U should future proof this issue by getting a bigger storage,btohqsg
next jump from 64gb is 256gb meh,btohqsg
Well ultimately ur choice. I just feel the 256 more value for money,btohqsg
or just go for bluetooth headset/earbuds,btohqsg
apple always do this shit by omitting 128gb. Thatâ€™s the sweet spot for me actually,btohqsg
i didnt know.....its such quite a dick move,btohqsg
still dun have??? thought they pushing magsafe charging,btohqsg
Ya force u to pay for the 256 storage. Anyway@leyBiT  64 gb by the time u install the OS  u left with 50gb or so. Minus the apps etc u will be left with 40,btohqsg
Yup and it keeps getting fatter with updates,btohqsg
If u want to spend more i rather u get the 256 model ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Are u willing to fork out extra every month then? For the cellular data,btohqsg
do you need the cellular function?,btohqsg
And is it even fully utilised,btohqsg
or should say the mobile data,btohqsg
is the lag perceptible for his game on hotspot?,btohqsg
Not worth that extra dough just to play his game when no wifi is around. Thatâ€™s my take,btohqsg
to me confirm not worth cuz i dun game ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ifs not just the initial cost for the cellular model. Itâ€™s also a monthly upkeep for the data plan,btohqsg
Then you have answered ur own question,btohqsg
$220 u invest in apple care or the stupid keyboard also better,btohqsg
