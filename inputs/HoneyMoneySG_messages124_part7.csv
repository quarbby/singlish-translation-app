Mine is housing loan  but likely the sameDBS giro ur car loan @ 8th of the mthCard up will charge based on the dates u put‚Ä¶ if is 8  it will charge u on 5th then 8 will pay u back the amount been giro by DBS,btohqsg
Is scb esaver the best saving acc with high interest,btohqsg
Define best. What criteria are you looking at?,btohqsg
Consider ocbc 360 with salary credit,btohqsg
So u mean that card up does not repay the loan but puts the money into the account the giro is suppose to deduct?,btohqsg
I will recommend HeyMax. Get some HeyMax miles while at the same time get the qualified spend into UOB One. HeyMax uses 5311 Departmental Store so no issues qualifying.,btohqsg
Hi Jimmy  I was reading through some T&C of some credit cards and I saw that loan repayments tended to be excluded from awarding of miles.Can I check which card you‚Äôre using to pay your loans with? Any idea if it will work for mortgage loans as well?,btohqsg
Passing through cardup doesn‚Äôt register as loansI‚Äôm using uob prvi for mortgage loans through cardup,btohqsg

Hi all Shifu  I just got my maybank platinum credit card. My first transaction is on 6th July. Current statement shows it‚Äôs $738.62  but total spent in July is $1012.28.May I ask  for this quarter  do I qualify for the $100 cash back since I spent 1k in July? Or do I not qualify due to my current billing cycle is only $738.62?,btohqsg
Iirc dbs vantage no eligible for welcome rewards thru cardup,btohqsg
Google UOB bank interbank Giro and self addressed envelope and you‚Äôll find a page which contains it üòä,btohqsg
Can‚Äôt do it via online banking right ? üòù,btohqsg
May I ask  this ocbc new credit card  1.6% can be used on insurance and bills like SP  Singtel  etc?,btohqsg
eligible for 100 quarterly cashback if fulfil 1k eligible spend in each of jul  Aug  sep calendar month. No need care what is the amount in your statement month,btohqsg
I seem to recall they go by calendar month and I scrambled for it when I first got the card and got the quarterly rebate.You should be good for it unless they suddenly changed T&C.I chiong the April month and still got $200 for the quarter.,btohqsg
read the TnC  insurance and utilities excluded,btohqsg
Hi all experts  is there any purchase that I can make to hit $500 on my uob? It seems the purchase for 4fingers  Yakun on 26th July are still not process yet and it‚Äôs alr 30 July.,btohqsg

Omg Omg. Thank you so much for üòäüôè,btohqsg
Hi I‚Äôm sorry this is a basic qn. If I am charged credit card annual fee which i manage to waive after calling the bank  but they say that the waiver will only be reflected in the following months statement. If this credit card bill is usually paid via bank GIRO  does that mean the current bill (including the annual fee) will be automatically deducted via GIRO first regardless?,btohqsg
Hi  I seldom use Grab for rides. I have a day trip to KL. Will the Grab MCC for rides allow me to clock 4mpd on Amaze CRMC combo that I'll link to Grab app? Thanks,btohqsg
Have done grab + amaze & crmc combo in Malaysia before. Should work.,btohqsg
You will be charged additional 3% in MYR for using foreign card,btohqsg
Didn't know this. I guess this is the same for using trust card with grab too?,btohqsg
Hey guyss! For the UOB preferred card limit  is the bonus spent limit based on posted date or the date of the transaction?,btohqsg
How long did it take to get approved,btohqsg
"yes  any ""foreign"" credit card (cards not issued in country of using grab) will be charged additional cost",btohqsg
I suppose. Think this foreign fee only start end of June 24.Previously there wasn't such fee,btohqsg
UserAhas 1/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:no irrelevant links allowed,btohqsg
Since Mar 24 for Grab SG. Other countries may have been earlier/later  like Thailand was back in Dec 23 and Philippines was back in Apr 24.,btohqsg
Poor form by Maybank though  silently nerfing since 20 Jun and only updated T&C subsequently.,btohqsg
Maybank quite long to approve. Probably 1 - 2 weeks to receive the card. Dunno why. And I only requested for $2500 credit limit. ü§£,btohqsg
Seems like another round of amaze vs UOB blame game ü§≠,btohqsg
