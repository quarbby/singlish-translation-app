My Credit Card Strategy is SCREWED with UOB EVOL Nerfhttps://youtu.be/V7abk9f45BE,btohqsg
technically not a nerf since 2.88% is promotional interest üåö,btohqsg
Actually is buff. We know they ending promotion end of month  dropping back to 2.5%. Now they gave us light back to 2.7%.,btohqsg
Yeah well it seems very deliberate to be slightly above GXS 2.68%,btohqsg
No one will complain if got more money,btohqsg
Between GXS and Mari? I use neither lol,btohqsg
interesting you have an app that you dont use,btohqsg
Sometimes got shopee promos for maribank. But also can use shopee pay for most of them. Maybe you're right... Should delete the app,btohqsg
the promotion isnt even better than what you get on using credit cards,btohqsg
Gotta compare lah ofc. Anyway I used to get free delivery vouchers through Mari  but now I just deliver to pickup points or lockers (which is free),btohqsg
For every $100k  the difference is about $1.67/per monthEvery $10k  the difference is $0.167/per month.,btohqsg
The nerf continues uh for hsbc revo,btohqsg
@MelvynEziyou want to know what SATS lounge have?,btohqsg
Hello may I know what‚Äôs the MCC code that appears on the credit card  via CardUp payments made?,btohqsg
Did you try to search the chat or heymax?,btohqsg
If HSBC Revolution is tagged to pay on CardUp for Property Tax  can the transaction earn Miles per dollar?,btohqsg
Anything that give me the most benefit for my overseas trip,btohqsg
Dang  that's crazy. Anyways  thanks for the info,btohqsg
I dont think that is crazy if i want best value out of my travel spending. U can always just go with the travel card like youtrip if u only want best exchange rate and no reward,btohqsg
I think that‚Äôs pretty normal for someone thats  in the credit card game for long enough,btohqsg
For me I just applied for the card without creditable and got the signup reward anyway.But take note I signed up directly with the bank instead of singsaver or moneysmart.,btohqsg
is there any amex card in singapore with no annual fees,btohqsg
Sry I meant crazy as in like impressive. Not in the negative sense,btohqsg
Do you do credit card churning too?,btohqsg
Dont get what u mean by churning,btohqsg
I think i am the least possible person in this group to be cc churning lol. My cc is all secured card  no signup benefit at all,btohqsg
It's when ppl sign up for cc sign up promos every year  rinse and repeat,btohqsg
I dont do that at all lol. I just apply and hold the card because of my spending habit and the card reward benefit that i enjoy. I hold card long term haha,btohqsg
I bring more than 10 cards overseas,btohqsg
üòÇ You guys are next level,btohqsg
Same sister. I don‚Äôt play ntb. By leaving a bank for months / year  you lose the monthly rewards that can be earned. As well as the risk you won‚Äôt get the same credit limit back.Cheap balance transfers are usually only offered to the long relationship customers.,btohqsg
I dont have problem waiving alot of card as some is my high useage card some is occasional. I do believe bank look at a whole when giving waiver,btohqsg
Scb is troublesome this year. Not waiving even my well utilised cards.,btohqsg
I dont see scb have much use for my case so i am ok with the other bank,btohqsg
Some similar: tcb  uob absolute  prvi  crmc  ocbc rewards  uob ls  ppv  manhattan  boc vi  Revo  HSBC adv,btohqsg
What‚Äôs sry? Is that gen z?,btohqsg
Same  lazy to do that ü´°,btohqsg
How do you know lol but not sry üòÇ,btohqsg
Just guessing and lazy to Google,btohqsg
Sry is sorry short form lol,btohqsg
SRY (which stands for sex-determiningregion Y gene) is found on the Y chromosome. In the cell  it binds to other DNA and in doing so distorts it dramatically out of shape. üòÄüòÉ,btohqsg
you don't necessarily need that many cards to start with  but if you have a high spend level and want to extract maximum value...gotta put in the work,btohqsg
At a glance I read as Gen Y üòÄ,btohqsg
Wah  thanks for sharing your arsenal of cards. I'm curious how you manage the annual fees? Do you request waivers for all of them?,btohqsg
For the HSBC Everyday Global Account  it says need to deposit $2000.1. Does it need to be salary crediting?2. Do I need to keep the money there for 1 month? Or just deposit and use it for the GIRO is good enough?,btohqsg
1. no need2. no need keep,btohqsg
