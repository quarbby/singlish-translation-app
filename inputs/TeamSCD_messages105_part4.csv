Not a big fan of the newer gen,btohqsg
hard to choose broMaybe more towards audi as the FC and comfort is so much better,btohqsg
but the newer ones have smarter electronics,btohqsg
Over the years all the jdm I tested n driven before,btohqsg
Is still one of the best,btohqsg
my FC for wrx was ard 7 - 7.6 km/l,btohqsg
Because they are the last Na build,btohqsg
I haven't had the chance to try the fk,btohqsg
So I can't give my thoughts on it,btohqsg
But stock fd2r suspension is a  killer,btohqsg
Esp when one wind down window n travel along tunnel,btohqsg
i miss the swift's VVT kick,btohqsg
i can definitely tell VTEC kick cfm more fun,btohqsg
if i'm already having so much fun from VVT,btohqsg
I mz3 to mz3 to rx8 guess my favorite brand,btohqsg
and i love how both of them still independant,btohqsg
I just wished rotaries got the development budget that could have made them more efficient or even hybridize,btohqsg
Would be so sad if it disappears,btohqsg
They kept saying about wanting to make the rotary a range extender or some sort,btohqsg
That one cant really count ba,btohqsg
My first car was a 3 tonner then Land Rover.,btohqsg
Drive two year I didn’t drive alr,btohqsg
If u want to count like that… light strike vehicle then RHIB,btohqsg
Land Rover still a car Ma,btohqsg
I have never wished for anything so hard as the vision coupe or rx9,btohqsg
but new miata might be a hybrid or EV,btohqsg
sometimes i wished i was a little older  maybe i would have owned a WRX or STI,btohqsg
but I'm also glad that I have my miat,btohqsg
Maybe i wont want also la,btohqsg
i'd rather be seen rolling in a cherry QQ,btohqsg
MX5 reminds me of a frog,btohqsg
How does it even work sia,btohqsg
Toyota they trying to program the motor to behave like a petrol car,btohqsg
so instead of step all the way you get instant torque,btohqsg
They regulate the torque based on how a normal engine would,btohqsg
to simulate how a petrol car works,btohqsg
But TL:DR edition: Toyota limiting the power of an EV just to make it drive like a petrol car,btohqsg
it honestly sounds something like throttle controller or some sort,btohqsg
It's just ECU tuning only i assume,btohqsg
But cannot compare w@SolahxKikoula he professional,btohqsg
I try come at 10? But I new and shy,btohqsg
Chair  snacks  drinks all is bring yourself,btohqsg
no need shy..we all friendly and easy going,btohqsg
