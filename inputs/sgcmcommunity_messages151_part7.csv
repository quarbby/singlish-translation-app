I had perfume smell stuck on my seatbelt,btohqsg
Soaking in dettol for 3 hours also the dettol lose 🤣,btohqsg
Wife complain why let my friend with strong perfume sit in the car,btohqsg
I pull the seat belt  close the door and put into a bucket of baking soda until my security at my house think someone play prank,btohqsg
Guess no harm in trying hahah,btohqsg
Haha! Sprinkle Liao then The whole box of baking soda put inside the car.,btohqsg
I just dumped 2 bags of baking soda in 🤣,btohqsg
I think the bucket had like 4kg,btohqsg
Mix mix like mixing lamian into sauce HAHAHA,btohqsg
I have a lot cause I use baking soda to clean things at home haha,btohqsg
Cabin filter oso shd change I think,btohqsg
Err I think no need lah but can if you want  no harm  cabin filters so cheap,btohqsg
or go to a detailer ask them to steam cleaning,btohqsg
and baking soda i thought have to use with vinegar,btohqsg
I had a bad smell in the cabin and had to change cabin filter 3 times in order to remove the smell,btohqsg
The cabin filter will absorb the foul smell and the smell gets recirculated in the cabin i,btohqsg

Hi there  Thanks for adding me to this group I am pretty new to SG  hence wanted to check which is the best place where I can get accessories for my ride ?,btohqsg
Anyone knows what pipe is this? Is it for Aircon? Thanks,btohqsg
It would greatly help if we know what engine we are looking at..,btohqsg
I see a part number on the tube. Try search them online,btohqsg
The last few seconds of the video can see some drips,btohqsg
You can also go all the way and put 4 Nissan rings.,btohqsg
Looks like it's part of the coolant assembly,btohqsg
Could you take a video showing where it starts and where it leads to?,btohqsg
Yeah very hard to tell with the zoomed in angle,btohqsg
Must understand ur aircon working harder cus now outside temp so hot,btohqsg
So if got condensation its kinda normal?,btohqsg
What car is that that is 'leaking'..,btohqsg
Ah yes that is an aircon line.. can see the low pressure cap there,btohqsg
The only leak U shud ever be worried about is when u drive off got black patch,btohqsg
HOW AM I RACIST IF ENGINE OIL IS BLACK SIAL,btohqsg
What if that car park floor design is black patches?,btohqsg
ENGINE OIL can be brown right?!,btohqsg
Touch the wrong thing and you might not have fingerprints,btohqsg
You just a man. It’s ok,btohqsg
You do. Just not on your fingers,btohqsg
But don't make your car a hypochondriac,btohqsg
It’s just condensation. Just wipe with a cloth and sit and watch. Chances are it’s cold to the touch and just water.,btohqsg
Also why your idle so rough,btohqsg
That's exactly what I was going to point out,btohqsg
We can spend the whole night troubleshooting,btohqsg
Sounds like those drilling machine sia,btohqsg
Or you bring to me but I charge for my time 🤣,btohqsg
Sounds like those 3 cyl rickshaws,btohqsg
