N I should have taken a photo of the drugs  then can share here.. I was shivering  cant wait to get rid of the shit  totally forgotten,btohqsg
Here the picture I extracted from lalamove delivery.,btohqsg
Who can pump at these places? Got 95?,btohqsg
https://dollarsandsense.sg/much-singapore-gig-economy-platform-workers-really-earnIn general  more than half of platform workers are aged 50 and above. Almost 80% of them have non-tertiary educational qualifications.,btohqsg
So here the users are mostly 50 years old and above uncles is it? Ha.,btohqsg
I think more n more young pple n those with higher educational certs also doing liao,btohqsg
More drivers than jobs. That's y customers can offer lower prices n still confident the jobs will be taken.,btohqsg
Thus riders/drivers r bullied into accepting these prices even when petrol gg up,btohqsg
Those driving car to do delivery will feel the impact more I guess. Lots more bike jobs now instead of cars,btohqsg
That is why I have been recommending people if this is your primary source of income  to go get a proper full-time delivery job  got CPF  meal provided  and stable income.,btohqsg
Every single seconds  single minutes to snatch jobs from the platform  not mentally stress?,btohqsg
Plus LLM didn't even buy insurance for accidental goods damaged/lost  you need to compensate if you damage/lost the goods. Then if sick or get into accident  they are also not gonna cover you.,btohqsg

I only get from him extra $40 for 2 days day pass cause need send and collect from workshop (mine is opc car) and then plus $280 for 2 days downtime income,btohqsg
Then he give me all these,btohqsg
Now i feel like asking him to pay me more. Cause i need put up with his nonsense 😒😒,btohqsg
Hey! From the video can clearly tell it’s his fault  if he is not willing to pay for damages under private route  just report to insurance :),btohqsg
To make story simple.. bang behind 100% is the car bang fault. Whatever story he/she gv dont want to lose ncd blah blah blah.. just report insurance.. play safe.. private settlement only when u got black and white paper if not report insurance,btohqsg
I’ve ever had an accident at a carpark  driver reversing without caution  bumped to my front bumper. My bumper suffered damages and workshop quoted 1.7k. the kind guy transferred 1.7k directly no questions asked. (i think he was afraid to affect his NCD)  but in any case since this guy is so impolite and defensive  you shd just report insurance to prevent any additional trouble since he’s not v cooperative also.,btohqsg
Then i think he should just be humble sia. I can dont give him 1.2k. But then his attitude. See liao dulan,btohqsg
And he tryna deny that i accelerate. Wth. My brake light wasnt even out. It was there all the way. And thru the cam  he is not slowing down at all,btohqsg
I will tell him  then u pay the workshop can liao,btohqsg
Inflation is real...repaint aso need so expensive🤣🤣,btohqsg

LLM can rest liao la... Petrol so exp... Really earn peanuts...,btohqsg
Hi all I’m a new lm car driver  have try work for 2 weeks/ 6 days  per day/8-10hrs what I earn for that 2 weeks only can cover my rental and petrol and of cos earn around 700-800 like that. Is that really that Low or I don’t know how to work in LM miss out of some skill and step. Can anyone that drive car can give me some advice. Thank.,btohqsg
After minus rental and petrol u still earn $700-800?,btohqsg
Meaning per week u earn $350 - $400 after minus rental and petrol?,btohqsg
I work 10 hrs and 6 days,btohqsg
I see my record I do around 150-200 a day for the 10ths,btohqsg
Not worth for u to rent car and do 6 days for 10 hours... u earn better if u do grabfood or foodpanda using the same timings...If u do those delivery app using bicycle u prob can earn more coz u don't have the car rental to minus..,btohqsg
But that is very litter compare to those parcel delivery that work 6days / 10hrs a day,btohqsg
Agreed I was use to a grab food cycling,btohqsg
How much is the rental anyway,btohqsg
150 to 200 a day for 8 to 10 hours is good enuff it means your per week almost 1k..,btohqsg
That truth but base hours spend that is really too Low,btohqsg
Plus petrol so ex... better go back to grab food cycling..,btohqsg
U mean cycling can earn $200 in shorter hours .. prove me wrong,btohqsg
Can’t the reatal still under 6 mth contact,btohqsg
No 10 hours PBA can have 30 trips,btohqsg
Bro  nowadays whatever can make do just make do.. other ppl earn less.. some earn more.. is the effort and strong mindset,btohqsg
One trips with Incentive is around 6-7$,btohqsg
so you earn about $400 for 60 hours of work?,btohqsg
No lah he earn 150 to 200 a day for 6 days is $1k plus,btohqsg
So u earn about $180-$210 for 30 trips per day.. this one no need to minus rental and petrol le..,btohqsg
Ya but is just that it is very dangerous i have hit my car before when cycle PAB,btohqsg
That is why plan to change mode of driving,btohqsg
I think bicycle is safer than motorbike though..,btohqsg
Ya true but you will be more tired,btohqsg
PAB is going easy but just that the battery you need to have 2 to run 30 trip,btohqsg
I think lalamove still can earn a decent amount so long u put in ur worktime and also know how the routes in and out .,btohqsg
U do car 10 hours a day not tired meh?? At least after 10 hours on bicycle u bank in $200 nett.. compared to $50 nett..,btohqsg
normal office hours is 45-48 hours a week. 60 hours is long  you should be taking back more  if not not worth the time n risk.,btohqsg
I always travel around 5-8km to the job place,btohqsg
10 hours on bicycle can give u $200 ?,btohqsg
Ya bro  don’t do too much driving,btohqsg
I try before in grab food using PAB 10 hrs max 30 job,btohqsg
If really need to  then find other source of income.,btohqsg
6 to 7 dollars per trip.. he said 30 trips per day... add up to about $200,btohqsg
Ya because now rental and petrol is really killing,btohqsg
Yes 30 trips   how long ?,btohqsg
60-70% of our earn go to them,btohqsg
He said 10 hours.. i never do delivery app b4..,btohqsg
But I change to llm is because I scare don’t have the life to see my family,btohqsg
In my area ardy got a few accident on grab food rider,btohqsg
Treat this as your own business   set the overheads aside and set a traget for ur profit .. u should be earning more than a coparate . Best factor of all is that u are it own boss..that freedom is priceless.  It works for some but it dosent work for some.. so no pressure if u think u cannot make it in lalamove do other platforms ..,btohqsg
Impossible to do 30 trips in 10 hrs .,btohqsg
I not saying can’t take it on llm but just want to find out from you all that more experience then me  because I just work 2 week only,btohqsg
Was thinking m I doing wrong or what I need to take note of,btohqsg
Can do it is because grabfood a lot back to back order,btohqsg
Very doable depending on how many collection points,btohqsg
Is like one place collect 3 location,btohqsg
Then yes   but that's considered one job yeah,btohqsg
U are doing correct la.. if u take home $150-$200..  nowadays llm fare sucks unless got surge or public hols... just tat u have to minus rental too.. so earn less..,btohqsg
Was think change from rent car to rent van lower down the cost,btohqsg
Actually u are doing pretty well for a starter   as soon as u have more favorite merchants and u know the places and the time taken for collection   u will be more efficiently earning..,btohqsg
Ya just to ask one more think,btohqsg
I keep see a heart on the order that mean what?,btohqsg
Use bicycle n cycle 10 hours..6 days aweek.. Think he will not have chance to use the money in bank after few months,btohqsg
It scared me some more got music,btohqsg
Btw if you guys pass by sinopac can petrol there llm get 25%,btohqsg
I just got to pump it today at 2.95 with 25% discount and with UOB card 5 % cash back,btohqsg
I see those gf cyclist especially at nite... I really damn scared for them but they no scared,btohqsg
Because of money and there PAB all got mob very fast,btohqsg
He also doing car 10 hours a day for 6 days..If he do bicycle 5 days a week for 10 hours.. at least he will have more time w family n more money than doing LLM car..,btohqsg
Ya but don’t scare no life some more I’m 39,btohqsg
I wish I still can have the life to see my daughter grow up,btohqsg
As gf rider everyday scare don’t know today will give the car or van or lorry or bus to bang us to hell,btohqsg
I wish too but I every day need to wake up 6am and send my daughter go sch,btohqsg
Yes especially so tired whole day under sun. Sure can't focus on road at times,btohqsg
So I only work 9am to 8pm when I was in gf,btohqsg
Use car do food can't earn la. Somemo now petrol so exp.,btohqsg
In gf time ya true can earn more then llm but really put out life in rise so more in year end keep raining we also need to complete those job on hand,btohqsg
Can’t use car to do gf,btohqsg
But now the grab express also price not very high,btohqsg
Llm have a lot of food delivery,btohqsg
Grab express is for car/bike to do it in 4 hours with muilt stop,btohqsg
The price is less then llm car mulit stop,btohqsg
Do phv la since you got car ...no need sweat . Walk here walk there or cycle,btohqsg
U sit in the car 10 hours 6 days a week also have health issues.. back problems more expensive in the long run..,btohqsg
I don’t like have work before long ago when that time still got Uber,btohqsg
That is why I choice llm else still can come out of the car walk here and walk there,btohqsg
Sit in the car 10 hours no joke,btohqsg
I eat piss all in the car last time when I was in Uber,btohqsg
Because that time can earn alot,btohqsg
But really eat shit pee all in the car lol,btohqsg
After they come out this stupid pdvl I stop and never work anymore,btohqsg
That is when Uber kanna kick out no one competing with grab the fare start to drop a lot and Incentive drop until like nothing,btohqsg
Actually guys no offense   but comparing this and that won't do u Amy good .. if u know how to work efficiently then any platform u can make money.. if u think otherwise leave the platform instead of still doing it and sulking about it .. cause honestly speaking if a new person ask for advise .. all I can see it people putting it down for them .. actually those are whom that do not invest their time proper.. so I suggest newbies just venture out and see whether it suits u.. some make 10k thru the platform while others make 2k.. it depends on what u are willing to sacrifice .. every industry there is risk and sacrifices   there is no easy job.. even doctors have risk in their job.. so either u take the risk or just continue to condemn everything,btohqsg
Tbh I like llm is more on really can come out from the car and walk here and there,btohqsg
I choice to come in llm that is why I trying out to find out to earn more I don’t mind spend 10 hours hard work looking at the screen all time when is driving try to get the job as always have the issue is the job have been taken don’t give up try again,btohqsg
I’m ok for this job if not won’t go and take a rent car for 6 mth daily 65$ to do llm,btohqsg
Wow 10k. Really work no day no night. Maybe 7days a week😅If no family no gf ok la.,btohqsg
Sharing my thinking is to see over this grp do it have anyone same like me working for 10 hours a day for 6day a week only can do 150-200 a day if it is that so I will feel that I never do anything wrong never miss away any step.,btohqsg
Just want to ask   anyone of your driving own car or rental thinking of trade in / buying a new car ? I mean with the current coe keep rising also any of your interested ?,btohqsg
Low coe hard to sell away if you never drive more then 3.5 year,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone need touch up paint 😂 I bought the wrong one for my car.,btohqsg
Yes 10k .. u work hard for it . Even if got family and u need the money to support your family then u will do it.. that's really up to individual and time management..,btohqsg
Some might not need to earn that amount   and that's why I said have a traget..n,btohqsg
Can earn 10k u also got no time to go spend . Everyday on the road,btohqsg
Yes soldiers and shipping line professionals are also away from their family..,btohqsg
There is no easy way out being a Singaporean..,btohqsg
From this I can see how u actually think..  u just don't earn to spend dude.. there are many more things that u have to earn for..,btohqsg
Strike a balance... Enough to use can liao... This kind are hard money...,btohqsg
U don't need a day off to settle ur bills do u ?,btohqsg
Dun want to die in a taxi like some uncle or die on the road hit by some drunk punks😅😅,btohqsg
Then don't die ...find another job.. remember alot of pedestrians die too.. so make sure cross the road properly,btohqsg
Not really ... But I go pump petrol still use the app,btohqsg
Once a while do llm ok . But u got full time job ?,btohqsg
Ya...if LLM ft I sure die😅,btohqsg
Ya lo. Actually don't care grab   llm or whichever platform. Do part time can already. Need to have a stable income,btohqsg
Do a bit help pump petrol😜,btohqsg
Well said .. but the question is how stable is your stable ?,btohqsg
Yeah. Cover car costs can liao,btohqsg
Stable means every mth you get the same amount of salary. Then delivery platform to cover your livings like makan bill  car cost,btohqsg
What if u lose ur stable job one day ?,btohqsg
Then if your doing delivery job  do first then in the mean time find job,btohqsg
So if delivery platform don't need manpower liao then how,btohqsg
What makes u think delivery job cannot be a full time job ?,btohqsg
Then what makes u think delivery cannot be a part time job?,btohqsg
delivery means manpower.. so I don't understand how delivery job won't need manpower.. especially with technology this days.. everyone ordering online .. so exports come in SG after that u think drones will deliver ?,btohqsg
Sometimes depends on luck  right time right place also,btohqsg
I never said it can't .. for many delivery jobs are PT jobs just to compliment their expenses.. bit for alot delivery jobs are full time too and they are earning pretty well,btohqsg
If you guys wanna get new or used car let me know okay ? I can try to help you guys to secure a lower rate and much more affordable monthly installment guys ! :) . Help help each other,btohqsg
Grab  FP  roo  LLM got pros and cons  as long as u feel ok to work  ok to earn   ok lo,btohqsg
Last time also don't have food delivery.. everything can change in the future.  Anyway I also nvr say delivery job not good what. What makes u so work up?,btohqsg
U work 1 year then sure got experience lo,btohqsg
This right here.. u are judgemental that everyone needs to have a stable income .. and that's why I asked u,btohqsg
Nowsdays  where got stable job one.....,btohqsg
To each of his own. I see alot of riders complain gov implementing rider to put on cpf. They don't want. But when they want to buy a house they don't have enough cash.,btohqsg

In sg  got hand got leg  won't hungry die la  just work lo  my fren full time car FP earn around 7k to 8k haven minus car installment n petrol,btohqsg
How many riders have to talked to ? Cause there's always a poll. Just like u and me..,btohqsg
Actually CPF is a good things,btohqsg
Did I say I talk to? Join some delivery platform chat and look at the conversation,btohqsg
Gahmen talking liao sure will implement... Sooner or later... Big money here ...,btohqsg
U still got do meh? Llm,btohqsg
When cpf implement. Alot rider sure quit,btohqsg
Once a while will do .. if got job good haha,btohqsg
Haha  don't worry  got new blood to replace,btohqsg
So u just base on the conversation.. why must u even ?? Just join work and try.. that way u get first hand experience.. not join the group..if u know what are ur capability then do accordingly.. don't need to depend on chats,btohqsg
App sound bi bo bi bo +6 +8 +10,btohqsg
Actually CPF aso your money ma. Still got employer contribute 17 percent .. y not,btohqsg
Every 1000 dollar I earn app top up 170... Ok leh,btohqsg
Actually u quite sensitive.  When@joel1688says about if he do llm ft he will die. U straight reply you haven't die. Well I not here to argue  with you.and how u know I not doing delivery job?,btohqsg
U 2 so free arh? Haha,btohqsg
Cuz most rider want 100% of the pay. By deducting 20% they think is lugi,btohqsg

When u need OA money to buy HDB then u will know how important for CPF,btohqsg
They never think long term. .. u buy house this money very good to use... Dun buy house aso can buy shares,btohqsg
Yes I am sensitive..not just sensitive but very sensitive.. I don't know whether u are doing delivery or not cause u never tell .. so yes sorry .. but have answered your 2 questions,btohqsg
Aiya chill la. I nvr say delivery full time not good. Just saying we need a stable income nia. I work delivery every day different amount . Every mth get different amount. Accept my apology. Everyone have their own personal opinion,btohqsg
I also  but who app will top u 17,btohqsg
But app still deciding . See how they nego with gahmen,btohqsg
U think grab will pay meh. So many riders. And they say they loss of profit recently,btohqsg
Sorry too man .. but just enlighten me which job is now considered a stable one,btohqsg
Soon. Gov see where can take money they take. Maybe they found one investment thing. Need use our cpf money to top up,btohqsg
Delivery full time or not full time doesn't matter la  as long as u can earn money ok liao,btohqsg
They pay but pay you $4 per trip 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Life still goes on  petrol up also lan lan,btohqsg

U always have alot here alot there .. what's makes me think is that typical mentality of your who can just think drawing and monthly pay is good enough. Hope u don't take this to ur deathbed.. go venture your potentials just don't be a servant for someone .. yes stability counts but it won't do your character a favour.. u will realize this in the long run .. cheers .. from ur replies I know u are still young .. therefore it's a marathon my friend,btohqsg
See. U always assume.  Stop assuming . You don't know my age.  When you said fail fitness out. And I reply I have friends inside who also fail their fitness but still inside the force you can't answer that. Like I say I not here to argue with you. U have ur thinking I have my thinking. Idk whatever I have said affected you so much. Oh well,btohqsg
Bro .. simple let me tell u a Singaporean way.. stop talking cock and go and sleep.. this chat is for lalamove.. not a chat for ur friends in FP or SPF. I don't know your age yes.. but ur replies tell me that u are a young punk .. maybe u are older but that simply means your mind is still like a child.. so .. drink your Milo and take ur bolster and go to sleep..,btohqsg
Show me that ur earning more than me with all your stability shit stuff and I will apologize for my rudeness in this same chat,btohqsg
