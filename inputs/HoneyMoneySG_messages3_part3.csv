if it ends up in-the-money  at maturity  if you get assigned  they will give you the 100 shares of stock and deduct the strike price X 100 from your cash account. That is why typically you need to enable margin in order to sell put option. But all these are brokerage specific  so you might want to check with those who use the same brokerage as you. For example Tiger  they might force you close the position on Friday maybe like 30 minutes or 1 hour before market close. I can only confirm the situation for IBKR because I have not traded options with Tiger before.,btohqsg
I watch your youtube to learn from you  so you are my shifu üôèüèªü§ó,btohqsg
Ok luh  i also learn from your video on US stocks  also shifu vice versa,btohqsg
Anyway  HI to all new members who joined recently from the BTO videos. Don't worry too much if you don't understand all these investing/finance jargons. Step by step you will learn along. But if you have any questions on HDB  BTO  Property  can ask here too,btohqsg
Just don't PM me otherwise I very busy to answer all of you,btohqsg
Which means for all sell options  regardless if it‚Äôs in the money/out of the money  we may get assigned? But assignment is at random right?,btohqsg
I think the short answer to your question is  in the money = assign  out of money = no assign,btohqsg
To add on this  the right to exercise belong to the option holder (those who bought the option). So if you short PLTR put with strike at $21 strike price  then tonight the share price is traded at $21.01 near the market closing  the option holder may still exercise and you get assigned,btohqsg
A public holder of an option usually must declare their notice to exercise by 5:30 p.m. on Friday. This time-frame will allow the broker to notify the exchange of the holders' intent by the actual expiration time on Saturday.,btohqsg
Regular trading hours for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq Stock Market are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern,btohqsg
so between 4.00pm and 5.30pm  if the share price continue to trend down (in the after-hours)  it is likely that the option holder will exercise. And during this period you cannot close your option already because options can only be traded during regular trading hours,btohqsg
One more thing  the holder could exercise before the maturity e.g. Wednesday or Thursday. This is common in situation where the time value is very low e.g. option is already deep in-the-money,btohqsg
Thanks for the more info üëç,btohqsg
21.01 did not hit 21. Option holder can exercise?,btohqsg

Please edit your message and remove the referral code or I will delete it. You can keep the message but ask people to pm you for referral instead,btohqsg
they can... even if the price is $22 they also can exercise. Just that we don't expect them to exercise because why would they exercise to sell at $21 when market is at $22? But there are such instances  but quite rare,btohqsg
Option holder is the one who sell the put?,btohqsg
Then why they want to sell at a lower price if market price is already higher,btohqsg
ya some are not educated ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ,btohqsg
if pltr trade at $22  you got assigned at $21  you actually get free money  assuming pltr open at $22 on Monday,btohqsg
I would avoid.(1) Looking at the website  there's no real crypto product(2) Whitepaper basically tells me there's no product.- it's a general introduction to Bitcoin  Blockchain and just a poor attempt at SEO marketing (all the buzzwords)(3) why do you need to KYC for DeFi?? it doesn't make sense,btohqsg
not saying won't be able to earn morning though.maybe you can cash out or have friends who have already done so.but this isn't really a crypto thing to me at all,btohqsg
free money means that you just bought at $21 and you can immediately sell at $22 on the market on Monday,btohqsg
if it doesn't take up your time  perhaps?but if it does  I rather spend the time reading up on something else or trying out a new DeFi protocol,btohqsg

Anyone interested to join Boon Tee's stock conference  you may do so at this link. Lots of good opinions there. It's tomorrow  Sunday morning,btohqsg
@boontee86whoa thanks for sharing and being transparent about your portfolio,btohqsg
I see that u got SE limited in there. Any thoughts whether it is a good time to buy it now at 310?,btohqsg
Thanks a lot@ChrisHMSGfor the sharing üôèüèª,btohqsg
SE is a growth stock  the valuation does seems high by traditional valuation metrics and still burning cash. This kind of companies we should expect high volatility. But if you believe their long-term strategy e.g. the global expansion and successful entrance into new lines of business (e.g. SeaMoney)  it could still be a good buy  even at current pricep/s: Edited the first line for better clarity,btohqsg
My portfolio reflects my conviction level  at 2% allocation I will say my conviction is not particularly high. I am still concerned with the cash burn and potential slower growth. All businesses face this risk it's just that if the valuation is high the crash would be more drastic if it happen.,btohqsg
By the way it is not a stock conference  we name it talk cock sing song because it is a casual weekend chat. It is a voice chat session  so if you have any questions or topic to talk about  can use the slido to let us know your questions. Actually this is the first time we are using slido  before this we just ask around see if anyone has questions or topic,btohqsg
Ya Gyüåàyou can ask the SE question in the slido and see what others think about it,btohqsg
Just checking the moneyowl srs promo  they allow multiple one time investments right? They will sum the amount invested via one-time investments as at end of Dec is it?,btohqsg
One-time top up only.Refer to tnc herehttps://www.moneyowl.com.sg/promotions/srs-promo/,btohqsg
But we can do multiple one-time top up right? What is excluded is the rsp right?,btohqsg
Once you top up the first time  they will take that amount to see which tier you qalualify for already,btohqsg
Thought we can split our top-up rather than just a first-time amount based on what they mentioned here,btohqsg
