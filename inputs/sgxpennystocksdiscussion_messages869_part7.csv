By the way .. today hear from 1 of my customer of his bad investment in buying new launch property . Just take key 2 month ago. Till now cannot rent out,btohqsg
Plus rental cannot cover his monthly loan .. still lose 4 to 500 buck monthly 😂,btohqsg
Now I hope every week have coffee money from sg pool enough Liao 😂,btohqsg
Cos you buy early ma plus free loan,btohqsg
My situation same as you . Also no problems for me 😂,btohqsg
Just to say that not every property investment confirm earn money 🤣,btohqsg
For sure. Not every stock also earn money,btohqsg
But property consider more safe than stock.. now alot people mind set buy property rent out .. now Bo return Liao 😂,btohqsg
Last time also no return. Now also the same.,btohqsg
Buy with full cash always have returned just more or less only .. if loan .. just working for the bank only 😂,btohqsg
Everyone also work for the bank but depends how long only,btohqsg
Usually at least 20 year .. but problem is rental cannot cover loan when loan from bank more than 60 percent of the property price usually .,btohqsg
Can cover but you just need to work harder to repay the principal value in order to pay lesser interests,btohqsg
If possible flip the property to cash out soon $$,btohqsg
I’m not an expert. Maybe here have but they no share,btohqsg
The first 5 to 10 year time is to repay the bank interest first 😂,btohqsg
Yes .. flip and flip . This is the only way . Or wait for enbloc ..,btohqsg
So you both contribute to inflation what 🤪,btohqsg
