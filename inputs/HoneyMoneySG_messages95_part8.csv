Same  I had so many transactions disappearing halfway  and taking 4-6 days to get posted.Can I check  I just received EVOL cashback yesterday. Is that for Jan-Feb spending  or Feb-Mar spending? Thanks!,btohqsg

Haiz... now my turn... sibei sian keep on need to block and replace for a new card,btohqsg
I think citibank kenna all the fraud shit now....,btohqsg
Managed to settle. It's funny when I try to transfer via desktop browser  I'm being charged for $19 fees. But when tried using POSB app  there's no fees.,btohqsg
Yea someone else mentioned desktop charging too. Good that it‚Äôs settled now,btohqsg
Few of my friends kena unauthorized transaction on citibank cc past few days. Same to me ytd. Saw the notification  did not authorize then block and kill switch the entire account. Apparently  once you block old card and report  for an instant  new card number will appear (only can see the last 4 digits)Then call citi hotline  they say will replace a new one within 3-5 business days. Then today  receive messages on OTP  for payment of a new card (not even received). Something is really wrong with citibank. Major security breach.,btohqsg
I got th same one too,btohqsg
I called them and they say there is no need to get the card replacement,btohqsg
I think this is the mass fraud and they are aware of it and investigating it...,btohqsg
Better replace  your card details got exposed alr,btohqsg
There is no point to request for new card now right  if the scammers can still access new card number,btohqsg
Tbh  i really don't know leh. Gonna call citi and report this. At least they aware,btohqsg
I kena last month too  once also a year ago. Both on the citi cashback+ card  i have never kena such things on other cards before. they are not secured bah,btohqsg
Just called. They say no need to replace the replacement one  as the card not activated yet  no way can be used,btohqsg
Hi gurus on the same note of oversea general spending. What are other good cards to get. These are the cards I have- UOB VS- Amaze + CRMC- HSBC REVO,btohqsg
Also anyone have any thoughts of HSBC T1 card,btohqsg
If i were to apply for hsbc travelone by singsaver  will i get singsaver rewards + hsbc 20k miles with annual fee payment? Wondering whether the 20k hsbc miles promo applies outside of bank page,btohqsg
hi  what's the best traditional place to buy and hold stocks at? i know a lot of e-trading platform exist now but I don't really have the confidence they will remain open for 10-15yrs time üòÖ any current investors know where i can dump my money at?,btohqsg
Just got my digital replacement card from citi after reporting of the fraud yesterday. Trying to link it with amaze but mentions bank is rejecting it? Anyone know why?,btohqsg
Ibkr. Good for long term investor,btohqsg
Need physical card to arrive first,btohqsg

Yes  usually 1 or 2 days later for my case,btohqsg
Hi  wat your take on investing in gold,btohqsg
"No way to be used  yet the card details are already compromised and Citi say ""it's fine  go ahead  use the compromised replacement card""?",btohqsg
Hi all  any suggestion for payment of the booking fee (10k) for car purchase? For now can only think of citi miles card..,btohqsg
Called Citi and they blamed it on Master which doesn‚Äôt sound right. It‚Äôs only ‚ÄúCiti‚Äù Mastercard got breached!,btohqsg
"Hopefully you got the name on record? If not  reach out to another CSO to confirm their ""no replacing of compromised replacement card"" policy (and record the call if possible).This is to cover all bases in case future fraud hits and Citi decides to play games with zero liability policy.",btohqsg
With so many people affected  actually is there really a need to get so worried? I mean not like it‚Äôs isolated incident to just a few people.And from what I see (myself included) no actual charges went through.,btohqsg
can consider splitting payments across various credit cards,btohqsg
A quick check Citi + Amaze combo. N use amaze card overseas. All transactions less travel related like hotel. Car rental etc. Will.earn 4mpd right?As long as within 1k limit,btohqsg
Perhaps can refer to TnC what are excluded?,btohqsg
Yes  if you don't mind the foreign exchange rate. But check the t&c for the exclusion  mainly is Travel stuff and the norm exclusion,btohqsg
What is the best multi currency card to use in Korea? I'm not a mile chaser  so Amaze would be out for me. So maybe comparing between iChange and revolut,btohqsg
Are u a cashback person then?Amaze isn‚Äôt only for miles.,btohqsg
hi.. referring to this uob dragon promo. if have 100k in my uob one acct  n  i never zero out  if i were to top up another 100k  just to confirm that only 100k would be ear mark? after the ear mark  i would be able to withdraw 100k right?,btohqsg
You don't really get much more bang for cashback cards  and they generally don't need amaze. I already have FnF 8% for dining  BOC Family 10% for dining  and ocbc frank 8% for fcy... Don't need amaze. Thinking of pairing with another multi currency card when I hit the spend limits,btohqsg
U will fail the earmark condition of maintaining $100k above 31 Dec balance.,btohqsg
he top up another 100k already  why fail,btohqsg
Why don‚Äôt zero it on 28 Mar or 30 Mar? Another 15-17 days to go.,btohqsg
Increment in account day-end balance must be maintained even through earmark period,btohqsg
We are assuming the next round of promotion happening on 30-Mar. Also  no point trying to catch the current round of promotion.,btohqsg
Hi  anyone used YouTrip to withdraw cash from overseas ATM? Is there any hidden fees? Will it show the exchange rate before confirming to withdraw the cash? Thanks,btohqsg
Ya. No point lock the extra $100k there n earn nothing.,btohqsg
