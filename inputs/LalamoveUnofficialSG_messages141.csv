You went down to the woodlands one?,btohqsg
The store do not exist at all there no such unit. However there are many ppl like us going down n mentioned SG durian,btohqsg
We should come up with a list of problematic customers n pin it,btohqsg
"""Hi  will require you to deliver sealed and packed durians. Payment will be made via paynow to your account after all job done  and once done will request from my finance to make payment.Once accepted order  please let me know your whatsapp number and also paynow number so that i can get my team to text you and coordinate with you and he will let you know the type of photos we will require to take.""",btohqsg
Omg someone just took this Yishun - 2x admiralty - AMK orders,btohqsg
I wanted screenshot to expose here but seems llm app has screenshot restriction policy?,btohqsg
Another victim of the durian Yishun miltonia case managed to screenshot,btohqsg
Refrain from this yishun Miltonia durian,btohqsg
What's worse is they expect u to download some app to take picture with time stamp etc and see its for timesheet recording purpose what nonsense,btohqsg
And other victims  not for my case said they gave excuses of dropp or dmg their durians n dw pay u becuase of it,btohqsg
Ok let me clarify1. The durian we are sending are labels as sg durian,btohqsg
I went down to their stores ar woodlands as indicated on their website and there is no such unit and store at woodlands,btohqsg
Check with all the businesses owner there about sgdurian they diverted me to a store with a old man sitting there. I confronted the old man.. the old man 1st reply was agitated.. he mention I no longer partner with sgdurian.they run away with my money and show me all the police report they make against the owner of sg durian.. unfortunately I cannot send the video here,btohqsg
The old man inform I am not the 1st one coming there to look for sgdurian,btohqsg
LOL the yishun - admiralty - AMK orders popped up again  same durian order,btohqsg
Then I mentioned I collected sg durian from 554 miltonia condo.. the old man cited that is where the sg durian owner resides,btohqsg
He keep encourage me to make a police report as many have made a report against sgdurian already,btohqsg
Those who wan the video pls pm me I be glad to share with evidences of this dodgy business,btohqsg
And renting out that mini Mart for it,btohqsg
Who is the admin of this group?,btohqsg
We should privatize this group only those who apply can join n see the messages lol,btohqsg
How come if so many police report made against the sgdurian they still can continue,btohqsg
These people are smart. That condo is probably rented. Then once too many issues  they will move again. These kinda sketchy business owners think they can run all the time.,btohqsg
They can operate under different entities,btohqsg
Behind man still same person.. saying that goes left pocket go in right go out and vice versa,btohqsg
How legit is this link? Scared this are the type which can access our bank account. Scammer kind,btohqsg
"Should report to LLM as well to ban this sender. Pity those driver/rider who dun know and took this order. If its a company structure kind of payment (get approval from management)  sender should be the one paying us first and they claim from their company  not us their ""non-employee"" waiting for approval to get payment.",btohqsg
For those who still want to continue doing LLM please be aware that you may having the same issue as me. Take care  especially those new bird,btohqsg
Which order is this? What happened?,btohqsg
The deduction very high what's the thing that has been delivered?,btohqsg
U have 2 different deductions. What happen?,btohqsg
Care to share what happen? I do llm 5 6 yrs liao nvr kena such deductions b4,btohqsg
Interested to know deliver what n what happened,btohqsg
Have lahh. But never more than $20. Heng. üôàüôâüôä,btohqsg
Closest was one time I send the food to wrong house,btohqsg
Then llm called me ask me if delivered yet I say yah. Then they say the customer say haven't received Then I check I realise send wrong house. Resto also call me Then say will call me back see how,btohqsg
I quickly cheong back  lucky the house they nvr touch the food yet then I take back deliver to correct house. Just a few houses awayüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
MPV job  one box of item drop,btohqsg
Oh dear..the deductions are so steep...let's hope u get more better jobs to recover üôè,btohqsg
Man how come always Yishun involved lol,btohqsg
Cannot rely on LLM  the more you do the more heart pain,btohqsg
Use another phone to take pics,btohqsg
The poor thing is no chance for driver to explain and argue even though you have proof,btohqsg
this one is the sender exploiting LLM T&C and not paying  need LLM to permaban the sender,btohqsg
but from the pic..the durain is already de-shelled and sealed in box ya?,btohqsg
wah this xiaodidi younger than me can scam using durian damaged as excuse to not pay? tsk tsk,btohqsg
Thsibisa report made against sgdurian not me for info,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why must insist cash payment on the spot during pick up. No nonsense pay after job done. A lot problem,btohqsg
"just ask nicely ""are u paying or other side paying"" makes life a whole lot easier :)",btohqsg
Yes unless is receiver pay then ok la,btohqsg
yeah lo so far my experience is mostly quite flexible one  either sender or receiver pay. if its company as sender typically they will pay la,btohqsg
Facts  happened to me bef too deduction of 50bucks lol damn bastard when I did deliver n llm didn't bother hearing me out,btohqsg
They always protect customer bastard move,btohqsg
I feel some customer super ahole  they complain despite no issue for free delivery but they don't know end up the ones who suffer is us,btohqsg
They don‚Äôt want then tell them to cancel. Because if in the end they don‚Äôt pay you  you complain to Llm also useless. Llm won‚Äôt reimburse you. Only can  advise you make police report,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the same logic as you get scammed by those purchase order. You don‚Äôt collect the money from them before you buy  anything goes wrong Llm also cannot help you.,btohqsg
Ya same... Never kena such thing before also... Care to share what happened bro?,btohqsg
Then this one u really suay lor,btohqsg
I also kana deduction before . I think is timeFor me to change platform liao . Guys Any recommendations?,btohqsg
I see that only MPV no pooling option,btohqsg
Even if they say otherside pay I will call Infront of user first,btohqsg
Best is to avoid cash order,btohqsg
I kena once B4 the client add $30tips. Payment at drop off. At mbs hotel tower 1 total $60 to collect. But they collect at drop off. So too rush to ask to paynow on the spot so jus trust the user will paynow,btohqsg
Need to call and call and WhatsApp so many times s till they paynow,btohqsg
ya dont rush la haha especially cash job,btohqsg
You can see courier order ?,btohqsg
Ya‚Ä¶I thought Wednesday but I received earlier today.,btohqsg
Mine not in yet lehh? You got shares with LLM is it?,btohqsg
Past few week alway tuesday money out,btohqsg
If I got shares  will give some to you‚Ä¶Lol,btohqsg
Recipient called me suddenly ask me where am I. I also like shock. Never introduce herself alsoRude recipient. She said why take so late. I said where got late. It's the sender who just send order,btohqsg
U be the judge based on the timing,btohqsg
Initially it was regular. Then they change to priority. Then I slide to take order,btohqsg
Based on the article... Whatever the product launch at 3pm...but all guests left by 320pm.20min launch/networking? Doesn't sound like a very important launch. No wonder they only ordered vadai for the VIP guests üòÉ,btohqsg
‚ÄúWell  I am the manager‚Äù gets me lol,btohqsg
The delivery timing doesn't even sound right. Who on earth will want to serve guest food at the very last min. I sense the recipient abit of exaggeration somewhere,btohqsg
Funny job. Need help drop off,btohqsg
I feel no wrong at your end.. Cos the distance also not very near n u already delivered on-time according to LLM policy,btohqsg
This is good.. Easy n fast jobüòç hope u took it,btohqsg
May I know if you stacked this order? ü§î,btohqsg
Not at all. My call log below with the sender. The 2.26pm was my usual protocol to call in first to dbl confirm order.,btohqsg
"So I was guessing I took the order like a few secs before I call at 2.26pm. How on the earth I can ""fly"" from Joo Chiat to Buona Vista by 3pm given the time I swipe I took the order. Haven't factor in my journey to Joo Chiat",btohqsg
So definitely not your fault..I hope LLM won't take it out on u even with all the evidence..,btohqsg
Then I've gotta use the power of viral already if that happens. With screenshot and such,btohqsg
This one is vendor problem. People want by 3pm but they wait till 2:35 then book priority.,btohqsg
lol I did this that day couldn‚Äôt find the location very noob of me,btohqsg
Initially was regular. Then they changed to Priority.Based on the news article  recipient seems to have opted for 12-3pm delivery. But then recipient change her mind and requested for specific 2.30pm to 3pm.I was guessing sender agreed to that specific timing but underestimate the timing it will take to travel from Joo Chiat to Buona Vista. Esp via PIE where it's always congested irregardless of time.Must also factor the duration I have to report to the security for me to go up to the building to send the order. This is an office building.,btohqsg
But let's see if LLM will contact me üòÅ,btohqsg
Well by their own standards‚Ä¶.there isn‚Äôt any reason against you here. Timing all met. No damages. Not rude. Cleared. They‚Äôll be thinking real hard.,btohqsg
Anyone took the woodlands to mount senai job?,btohqsg
Keep seeing drivers taking the job but then the job reappeared again and again,btohqsg
Most likely it‚Äôs a scam order man.,btohqsg
Different accounts sameJob‚Ä¶.10 couriers at the door,btohqsg
LLM should set a rule: if a job keeps getting cancelled a number of times  auto delete the job,btohqsg
Guys need to be careful with buy for me orders. There‚Äôs a customer wanted to cheat me. They order and paid from the shop already so I only needed to pick up and send to them. Reached their location they say they don‚Äôt want to put the buy for me charges because I didn‚Äôt buy for them. I told them the app show how much is how much. How can they wait for the driver to delivered then want to edit price. Nearly call police before they ok to pay. Fucked up people just want to jack up the price so drivers will accept then after deliver don‚Äôt wanna pay total price,btohqsg
Yah drivers life is so hard Liao they still pull this type of stunt terrible,btohqsg
My experience was with a flower shop   last minute edit the location and the location was further than the first address and fares was much lower (( I have no idea why this was) then they refused to cancel on their end so suck thumb have to do the job,btohqsg
Exactly. Never think for others. They don‚Äôt pay full but Lalamove will still deduct their commission from the full fee causing the driver need to pay extra commission for nothing,btohqsg
This kind of tricky people a lot. I also get a few orders like this. Add stop after accepting but new fare lower than the original fare,btohqsg
They say the original address someone already took the parcel by mistake. So they change address for me . Don‚Äôt know real or not la but Sibeh bo Hua,btohqsg
This is not new guys.. last 2 yrs i did also get same treatment. So go back to basic  accepted order  call for confirmation and item details before proceeding. LLM customer pattern and also LLM wont blame customer  remember that. üëå‚úåÔ∏è,btohqsg
Now adays llm user many partten jus to save a few drs,btohqsg
LLM is already so cheap. Somemore want to chut pattern.Really cheap skate ppl. Have option to take Grab they dun want. Obviously grab more systematic then LLM but Bottomline cos cheap.,btohqsg
If edit location  you can still choose to accept the change or not mahh? ü§î Unless you haven‚Äôt started the trip.,btohqsg
Yes expensive. Grab partners have value... unlike LLM.. hahhaa,btohqsg
Expensive but service ok  I think acceptable. If do grab can cover petrol  labour  ERP (not sure if u know grab can claim ERP)  then ok lah. Happy driver happy consumer.LLM all parties not happy üòÇ,btohqsg
Yishun and sumang now just cross traffic light only... u dk ah.. whahhahaa,btohqsg
I hope u are joking ü§£,btohqsg
If seletar maybe yes. But not Sumang,btohqsg
Anyone have any idea why fking oddle will last minute cancel order? CCB I reaching desy then tio cancel,btohqsg
Dats y. I nvr take oddly,btohqsg
Block and postal code no same at dropoff,btohqsg
Loophole  can't call only can message,btohqsg
The is happened to me before too  they key in sumang lane ended up it's Yishun and bring me to yishun lol,btohqsg
And price was charged Yishun price,btohqsg
Their GPS cock up. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Haiz!,btohqsg
Didn‚Äôt know bike can carry trolley and 10 Boxes,btohqsg
Hi all  this is out of topic for LLM. Anyone well verse with workshop and repair of conti car? Can PM me? Thanks,btohqsg
All thanks to Fking Lalamove & the fking idiot that took the job!!!,btohqsg
This one I suspect is just trying luck. Since driver can see courier order.,btohqsg
That day I saw a llm 2.4 Bangla took a pooling job at kaki Bukit to woodland $19 with long side skirt,btohqsg
They simi sai also take one. Anyway their vehicle n diesel don't need They pay one,btohqsg
That's why now wan add money due to over size or over sibei hard Liao,btohqsg
Now move items office to office like shift office items only $23ü§£,btohqsg
Those shifting companies very smart. They get people to book shifting. Then they come book lalamove get lalamove shift. They do nothing. Earn $37 just by place lalamove orders,btohqsg
Lalamove drivers become the shifting companies workers,btohqsg
That's why I quit 2.4 and convert to sedan,btohqsg
The pax who book lalamove mostly third party companies,btohqsg
Wah....üòÇlalamove is the cheapest manpower like factory bake cakes sell to hotel   hotel sell sky high price.,btohqsg
So die die no +$ or surcharge don't take lorüòÇ,btohqsg
LLM 2.4 must see order and do.,btohqsg
Most probably the service quality bar will go down very very fast,btohqsg
I delete 2.4 ACC and change to sedan,btohqsg
Do courier job better than 2.4,btohqsg
Sedan n courier less items bah,btohqsg
But dunno how the 2.4 price is lahüòÇ,btohqsg
Very long no do  tdy do not bad quite heng 4 jobs got $90,btohqsg
Now do 1 private job go hm after that. $25,btohqsg
2.4 last time sibei good wan fren. I rmb I start many yrs ago when 40 base price for 2.4 and 32 base price for 1.7,btohqsg
Last time one morning 9am to 1pm can earn $180 Liao without choosing job,btohqsg
Motor job also good price last time,btohqsg
12 base fee and 30cents every km,btohqsg
Sedan is 16 and 50cents every km,btohqsg
Slowly go down 2.4 $38 50cents per km1.7 $30 50cents per km,btohqsg
All because of the stupid MPV the sedan became $12,btohqsg
And the stupid MPV make 1.7 job so less,btohqsg
Now 2.4 $32 without any millage,btohqsg
Yeah  I don't like your flooding.Leohas been temporarily muted for 1 hour.,btohqsg
Last time all the prices good,btohqsg
100 per day now do like dog bro not like last time easily,btohqsg
Durian orders all appearing once again,btohqsg
v long liao no one take,btohqsg
You do alr is for charity,btohqsg
They hve excuses dw pay you,btohqsg
Yeah last time very easy 100,btohqsg
Yah  that's y 5 jobs hit that I happy. N all not long distance,btohqsg
Pooling somemore. Who takes this is a fool. Haha,btohqsg
Goodness...I wonder who will take ü•¥,btohqsg
R2d at woodlands harvest. They only do conti cars and have a good experience with them.,btohqsg
Well versed in conti cars  in JB.,btohqsg
Nowadays all cus using pooling and want fast really is joker,btohqsg
Yup2. But there's more then a joker who will took it..,btohqsg
Take then deliver 4hrs LOL delay them,btohqsg
If not don't take at all,btohqsg
$18-$20 1 point to another point after deduct earn $13-14 not yet minus our costAnd cus think we will only take their 1 job onlyPls la if there is cus in this group pls spare a thought for us a delivery person,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt lei cos some is Malay fasting food they need to break fastI feel bad if I do like this,btohqsg
The problem is they deliver food they never write there,btohqsg
If I see is food I confirm won‚Äôt take,btohqsg
Thats true then don't take at all hahaah,btohqsg
This job post very long Liao,btohqsg
Nobody is going to do that for 10 haha.,btohqsg
Correct just msg them since it's pooling we go with protocol withhin 4hours so they will change to regular or priority..let them learn if still on pooling then go by the protocol üòé,btohqsg
You should not feel bad. The user who book the order is the wan that should feel bad,btohqsg
The user ownself know breaking fast is important. Yet choose pooling order to save cost,btohqsg
Technically you‚Äôre not wrong if you follow the pooling protocol.,btohqsg
Don't take till they jack to regular,btohqsg
I only take pooling order when I stack 2 immediate order,btohqsg
If receiver asked  just let them know. I ever call out on the HBB and restaurant on the delivery type. After that they call me and feedback about why I do that. I said I do it to protect my own backside.,btohqsg
So 3 jobs at once? üò±,btohqsg
Which they won‚Äôt. Let them learn the hard way.,btohqsg
I take up to 4 but regular go 1st. Pooling can roller coaster,btohqsg
Technically bo salah mahh? But must follow protocol by the book.,btohqsg
Yes dun burst timing can already.,btohqsg
But some user really dun understand about pooling order. They chose the cheapest. That's why llm should not come out with so many options,btohqsg
This will only let user take advantage,btohqsg
Recommend jst don't take pooling at all boycott it,btohqsg
If U got other orders then you leave them inside your car when U go do your deliveries meh? Later come back your car gone üíÄ,btohqsg
2 regulars within 1 hour can finished?,btohqsg
Definitely possible  speaking from experience. Must know the postal code or at least pick up area must be nearby.,btohqsg
2picks n 2 drops. 4points quite tight@15mins/point. Unless all are nearby n same direction.,btohqsg
Just need to plan ur stack pickup pts near each other n drop off pts along same route/direction n not too far apart lor,btohqsg
Don't b like one drop east one drop west,btohqsg
One pick east one pick west,btohqsg
üòÇüëç I think now not much job can stack.üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Plan it out n see ur luck also.,btohqsg
Yes can for sure..as long as nearby..I usually aim for similar pick up points or similar drop off areas..,btohqsg
Haha .all the experienced bosses here ü§©,btohqsg
End work.. online got received order.. called customer stated small item... end up big flower... 80cm long.. motorbike how to carry. Customer says last time can. And dont want compensate. Be careful ya guys..n,btohqsg
33 lor 19 geylang.. those motorbike be careful.,btohqsg
Need to start making a list. But cannot blame coz sometimes other drivers spoil market.,btohqsg
True enough.. but if motorbike really took something like this  higher chances the item will damage. Later on  must bare the item costing as well. Jialat.,btohqsg
Any 14ft or 24ft driver here?,btohqsg
Make sure u make a call b4 heading down. Swipe arrive . Report CS of oversize item cannot deliver. If not cash order  u can receive 50percent compensation,btohqsg
"Already done call b4 proceeding. My sop since last 2 years ago.. hahhaa.. sender mention ""flower  small only"". Lol.. so many pattern",btohqsg
And yes  i dont mind cause i will get that 50% compensate as usual.. just create awarness so u guys wont waste time and voice to argue.,btohqsg
I always kept this to show customer.,btohqsg
Dining table  chair and 2 bags of clothes. He booked MPV. Crazy enough?,btohqsg
Too much nowdays customer. Low IQ,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I say sooner or later will got people book Lalamove for delivering coffin,btohqsg
Guess so cause pass few payments also Tue in,btohqsg
I see  I very long no money from llm liaoüòÇ,btohqsg
How‚Äôs the $ as a full time llm driver?,btohqsg
Go find other job  no hope,btohqsg
I‚Äôm out of job actually üòÇ,btohqsg
How come mine still not in? Always delayed. Is it coz I part part time? ü§î,btohqsg
Bounce in and then come out again? Like that is it?,btohqsg
Because of our lovely lala cus call to complain say I late now want compensation,btohqsg
Panda better. More region oriented. Don‚Äôt need to go islandwide. ü§£,btohqsg
I think you tio arrow lahh Bro.,btohqsg
Really joker want fast don order pooling don give ppl wait at your shop for orderSome more now fasting month if your restaurant cannot cope with so much order don take so much orderCus complain youYou go lala complain driverWtf,btohqsg
This order they put car no put foodWhen text them no reply call no ansI no choice I have to there Liao cos my acc at risk cannot cancel LiaoWhen reach shop waited about 30-40 min to get the foodMore worst the food is need trolly also never putI need to walk go and back 2 time,btohqsg
If I know is food I won‚Äôt take Liao,btohqsg
Wahhhh? Restaurant is it? That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt come early or on time. I come 5-7 mins after the pick up time. But then along the way must ‚Äúcatch up lost time‚Äù. But if come after that but still must wait  then something wrong. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I don want to say name of the restaurantBut is at the east side,btohqsg
Wahhhh? Trolley some more? Confirm not car order size.,btohqsg
If any brother here going east side take order be carefulThey no put food only put car,btohqsg
Later I say name the boss of the restaurant In this group I dieLater he sue me haha,btohqsg
Cus complain them they ald complain lala LiaoIt If I mention the name I think Lagi worst,btohqsg
Maybe you give road name  the old timers here would know which restaurant. Don‚Äôt need give zhun address. He cannot be the only restaurant in the street right?,btohqsg
But did you claim waiting fee?,btohqsg
I think ppl will know la east side deGo there must queue to take your orderThey got no fucking systemTo give delivery personnel,btohqsg
I lazy to text cus service,btohqsg
Text also must waitI just want fast fast take fast fast go,btohqsg
So no choice. There a saying that goes lan lan suck Xxxx,btohqsg
All these platforms always protect their customers 1st,btohqsg
We dun take some will take the order too.  From last time covid days till now all platform is the same.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I usually take screenshots of the map if got jam or heavy traffic especially on weekends ( + peak hour ). Saved my arse so many times. Just my two cents. But at the end of the day  it‚Äôs driver‚Äôs preferences.,btohqsg
Only ma fan thing is every month need to do ‚Äúspring cleaning‚Äù. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
I last time also like that but when talk to the cus service really tired just wait or this may pattern,btohqsg
I might as well take job go off better,btohqsg
While waiting usually I will take screenshots of my watch and outside the restaurant. After collect order  do the same thing. Then just update them. Once 40 mins orders in a day  I racked up $24 just on waiting fees alone. üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
I hope don Kanna this type again,btohqsg
I‚Äôm time sensitive  coz like you time is money to me. üôäüôâüôà Coz I‚Äôm doing this after my FT job. Not to shake leg and wait for their food.,btohqsg
Need to keep up with the times lahh Bro. Adapt to survive. üëçüèΩ,btohqsg
I just hope if there is cus in this group pls don‚Äôt book pooling if urgent or need delivery foodSpare a thought for the delivery personIf really book pooling if late don complain to cus service alsoCos they will hold their salaryWhat if got ppl urgent need the money for food for their family or other thingInside this money not only ur order money is the driver hard earn 1 week salary,btohqsg
Cash out daily also every Wednesday then banked in. What‚Äôs the point? üòÖ,btohqsg

I first time kena they also nv give chance üò≠,btohqsg
Maybe can try appeal with the delivery details from the lalamove apps,btohqsg
"I saw the appeal conditions  except for medical situation  indirectly they say ""don't waste ur time"" ü§£",btohqsg
