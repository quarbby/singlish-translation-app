woodlands to city square in 30min,btohqsg
I think it's just the timing la ngl,btohqsg
who the hell goes to JB on a Monday morning,btohqsg
How painful is it to be removed,btohqsg
Anyone got any experience in recent years,btohqsg
idk but my sis say it will be quite painful,btohqsg
Hi guys has anyone here participated in shanghai ti math cup? How did ur school prep u for it? TIA,btohqsg
Saying it again  screw that terrorist,btohqsg
Would’ve loved to go to JB this week if not for him,btohqsg
ngl my trip back to sg on Saturday was v smooth,btohqsg
Not like going to johor would get me killed,btohqsg
overreact first when there's not enough info,btohqsg
I think it's more of  if they need you it's easier to recall u,btohqsg
Ok ya but tbh it shouldn’t apply to everyone especially if their role is not on the frontlines,btohqsg
Anyone can do my job lol,btohqsg
in the case whr smth rly happens in sg and you're overseas  border confirm close u cannot come back,btohqsg
scdf not competent enough to differentiate and it's alot easier to blanket cover everyone,btohqsg
Oh ok I thought you mean recall as in they call me back from my vacation leave cos got something important,btohqsg
I just got to suck it up,btohqsg
ya recall u back to station/position because believe it or not even ASAs gna be called to do saikang unless you're physically unable,btohqsg
my C9 friends all had to do saikang even during peacetime,btohqsg
The point is I’m entitled to my VL,btohqsg
Whether I take it overseas or locally someone else would cover when I’m away,btohqsg
And I also cover for others when they’re gone,btohqsg
gg i sent my number and my profile photo to the tuition employer,btohqsg
and i forgot that my pfp was the fucking,btohqsg
Tbh I also don’t mind going on the weekends and never once have I heard of ASA being recalled on weekends because of some emergency lol,btohqsg
But I guess they’re too paranoid so must ban all travel,btohqsg
"govt mah. is always a ""what if""",btohqsg
for reference this was my profile photo,btohqsg
nobody wants to be the sucker who allowed some random NSF to go overseas then end up need recall cannot recall then they get fucked,btohqsg
wasn't it revealed that there wasn't even a terrorist though,btohqsg
it was just a whole.. misunderstanding,btohqsg
today's society has developed to the point where nothing should surprise us anymore but look where we are,btohqsg
Nah I can imagine someone enrolled with that pfp,btohqsg
Bros about to have a nickname before even joining,btohqsg
i think josh is quite immune to the nicknames already,btohqsg
the guy that made headlines for killing 2 cops in malaysia,btohqsg
thought to be a terrorist but was just someone acting on his own,btohqsg
wont they give u anesthesia for that,btohqsg
some people get general anesthesia when u extract teeth,btohqsg
so theres honestly nothing to worry about,btohqsg
i mean i had 4 of my normal premolar teeth extracted for braces  that didnt hurt at all,btohqsg
they injected local anaesthetic into my gums,btohqsg
the only feeling i had was numbness until saliva started dripping from my mouth cuz i couldnt feel my mouth at all,btohqsg
those who did eae is it a must to hav work experience,btohqsg
No.. assuming u applying as a O/N level student. If u are apply for it under the Working Adults scheme then that's a different issue.,btohqsg
@IcedMiloAverage NTU Roomie be like... wdf,btohqsg

Ainoway bruh that was so weird,btohqsg
oh was it o level chinese today?,btohqsg
right wait is qn 13 c or d sia,btohqsg
Idk sia my friend put D i put C,btohqsg
I think its C coz the para mainly talks about C,btohqsg
Then D is only in like the last line,btohqsg
So i think C is the point lor,btohqsg
last 4 qns verified and likely correct,btohqsg
I unds that usually the point they put in first/last line of the para but the para keeps yapping abt C only last line then D come up,btohqsg
i have no idea  i put C cause its in thr passage,btohqsg
eh shit sorry i tot qn 12,btohqsg
my chinese ended up being better than my english,btohqsg
so idk the meaning of u saying me dun anyhow,btohqsg
my chinese and eng equally jialat,btohqsg

Pfft yall have a MT? I don't even have one,btohqsg

Na my First language is Singlish,btohqsg
your terrible jokes are making me look constipated in class,btohqsg
Ah bang that one is literally food color,btohqsg
At least someone acknowledged that my humor is terrible,btohqsg
HAS NO ONE EVER SAID THAT TO YOU??,btohqsg
Somehow I feel that no one can tell the difference,btohqsg
Idk I reserve judgement for future encounters once more data is available,btohqsg
No one judges  only god judge,btohqsg
that just evidently proves low eq exists,btohqsg
idk whether this is a high iq low eq or low iq low eq moment,btohqsg
Well then tell God to stop fucking judging us without qualification,btohqsg
u tell lah i scared bro,btohqsg
another terrible joker ( realist ) is@Chaeyeonsana,btohqsg
u should do cl literature in uni,btohqsg

I come back to dis shit wdf,btohqsg

"""who is this possessed woman laughing at her screen""",btohqsg
u say my joke so lame until u burst out laughing,btohqsg
so is ot lame or not,btohqsg
im talking about you being lame,btohqsg
no wonder you said you fail languages,btohqsg
HE DIDN'T BOTHER TURNING AROUND to see who laughed,btohqsg
There's like an old adage.No one looks down just at their crotch and laugh,btohqsg
only like 25% of the class is paying attention,btohqsg
im going to die laughing off,btohqsg
no way this is actually a thing,btohqsg
damn bro on his villain arc rn,btohqsg
i got food to entertain me,btohqsg
subt x into the econs equation,btohqsg
yes the 花米 bao alr become 爆米花,btohqsg
i pretend i do not see anything,btohqsg
i can delulu my way out of this,btohqsg
but u can solulu your way,btohqsg
if you buy alcohol right  do you need to produce id,btohqsg
i don't have my ic with me,btohqsg
so next best option is either student card or singpass,btohqsg
if i go overseas and the automated machine at the airport can't recognise my face either then how sia,btohqsg
i ask my mother help buy instead,btohqsg
Refresh your phone or sth bro,btohqsg
i try refreshing  clearing cache & cleaning the phone no use,btohqsg
U got any other pps that require face verification or sth maybe can try,btohqsg
Or maybe u go airport now and try face verification 😂,btohqsg
even though my skin is of rabz condition,btohqsg
im spitting blood due to speechlessness,btohqsg
Same reason why Minh is to,btohqsg
eh has anyone else been getting a lot of surveys from government departments,btohqsg
Bro laughing like he the villain bruh...,btohqsg
Wht you mean he ain't laughing...man,btohqsg
i actually got free money out of those,btohqsg
😭 am i the only one..,btohqsg
Yea I know you can get money  I got friends that earned $80 from them,btohqsg
so far i think about 30,btohqsg
eh but did they go find surveys to do or,btohqsg
All they had to do was answer the surveys pretty much but still very unviable way to make money tho,btohqsg
Cause you be spending 2 hrs for $20,btohqsg
oh chey my case is that the surveyors somehow managed to find me,btohqsg
You know what that means? Your phone num is circulating around sg,btohqsg
it all started when i took a survey from prudential at jurong point,btohqsg
imma off with my head then,btohqsg
The only way they know that this particular phone number is tied to a potential person of interest for their surveys can only mean they know your details,btohqsg
just bc i feel it doesn't mean its true,btohqsg
The president and vp phone is online,btohqsg
Fun man  next time you work for the govt...you rise to high. Your phone number gonna end up on a international website,btohqsg
at that point u wld also be given allowance for a work phone/work number,btohqsg
but no legit  this was my first time hearing it,btohqsg
I think ya  idk also I see everyone buying durian,btohqsg
so you get one for urself too,btohqsg
nah last month I bought 1k rmb worth already,btohqsg
Ok that’s expensive. Looks like some variety that’s not from Malaysia,btohqsg
In Singapore during the peak season can get MSW grade A durians for maybe $15-$22/kg,btohqsg
Don’t think I’ve ever seen them in Singapore,btohqsg
hmmmm price around 10k per 100g,btohqsg
Also many unscrupulous durian sellers would try to upsell Thai durians as Malaysia durians when Malaysia durians are not in season,btohqsg
Rn it's easier to export to SG than China,btohqsg
Cuz we can just do it by truck,btohqsg
Yeah unfortunately so that’s why we can get it relatively cheap,btohqsg
What breed isit? Or isit like the local variety.,btohqsg
Ok then the price is not bad assuming the durians are about as decent as the cheap Malaysia varieties,btohqsg
Cheap Malaysia varieties as in stuff like Kampong or lower end durians that have a cultivar number (so durians like D1  D13),btohqsg
The malaysia varieties are very pungent tho which is what SG market likes,btohqsg
Yeah because unlike Thai they wait for them to drop to the ground,btohqsg
Thai durians can be nice if harvested from the ground,btohqsg
Or just made up names like Red Prawn Black Pearl or Sultan King,btohqsg
Bruh u have no idea the joy of having a bitter durian,btohqsg
There's like a whole spectrum of flavours from Durian Sweet Bitter Numb some and different fruity notes like some can have an alcoholic aftertaste as well,btohqsg
Red prawn=D175  Black Pearl aka Taiyuan=?  Sultan king=D24,btohqsg
Those are the lower end to middle tier varieties,btohqsg
Black Pearl I’m not sure what cultivar number it is,btohqsg
Some like D13 are just referred like that while the colloquial name is popular as a description of the fruit itself,btohqsg
I don’t know how the D13 got the johor red prawn name,btohqsg
When red prawn was actually meant to be for another cultivar,btohqsg
Red Prawn if I remember correctly has a distinct slightly red hue to the flesh and the seed is massive and round,btohqsg
Red prawn is a bit more pinkish-orangish  may not be as sweet and more bitter,btohqsg
Either ways usually D13 is priced lower than Red Prawn when I look at it in most seasons,btohqsg
D13 is always those small ones which probably makes sense why it's always the cheap one,btohqsg
Possibly but also there can be quite big D13s  I think maybe it’s because the seed tends to be bigger and the taste doesn’t feel as complex so people feel that it’s inferior to D175,btohqsg
D175 the seed alr massive af liao imo,btohqsg
I still think for the classic full bite of a durian only MSW can provide,btohqsg
D175 I thought even with the bigger seed ones the meat not as thin,btohqsg
D175 more likely to have that bitter taste also,btohqsg
Yeah red prawn got chance for a more nuance taste that ppl like which is why the price is always higher than D13,btohqsg
Business ppl  Amazon is a source of passive income for Jeff bezos right,btohqsg
Cause he earns money through the companies that advertise or sell their products on the platform,btohqsg
And he gets a portion of the profit from it,btohqsg

i got a headache reading this ngl,btohqsg
At this point we got a bunch of anime pfps with interesting ass names,btohqsg
Can very easily loose track of who is who fr,btohqsg
i couldn't even understand the whole durian topic earlier on,btohqsg
no ik nvidia geforce but how is that related to factor immobility and market dominance,btohqsg
that one requires someone who has more expertise in that area,btohqsg
and my whatsapp won't shut up,btohqsg
AI shiiii is their thing now tbh,btohqsg
ngl when i saw Amos Yee typing in the other gc i mistook it for some other dude probably in jail already,btohqsg
Nvm nvm on completely diff pages lol,btohqsg
and idk if it's Amos Yee or Amos Ng either fuck,btohqsg
you should continue trying to explain the correlation between the two subjects,btohqsg
Nvidia AI go BRRRRR  everyone elses cannot BRRRR so everyone buys Nvidia AI,btohqsg
Tho amds catching up  was it microsoft planning on using them for their next big project,btohqsg
this somehow ended up being funnier  than i expected,btohqsg
i see AI being talked abt,btohqsg
well well well this can be a rap,btohqsg
The powerful results come after a run that has seen its stock price more than double in less than a year  leading to a valuation north of $2 trillion. That’s because Nvidia is the dominant supplier of chips needed to train and operate large generative artificial intelligence models  which  you may have noticed  are quite the thing.“Dominant” is maybe an understatement. Nvidia isestimatedto control more than 90% of the market for specialized AI chips. But you can bet there are competitors with their eye on a piece of that pie.Nvidia’s path to superstardom in the AI economy started with a happy accident. The company designs graphics processing units  or GPUs  which were intended to  that’s right  process graphics.“For a long time  these chips were mostly used in computer gaming ” said Chris Miller  author of “Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology.”He said GPUs can run multiple calculations at once instead of in a sequence. “And it turned out that that same set of calculations were useful in training and deploying AI systems ” he said.Nvidia’s leaders leaned into their first-mover advantage  said Daniel Newman  CEO and tech analyst at the Futurum Group.“Nvidia doesn’t just have a vision of saying  ‘Let’s sell lots of GPUs.’ You know  Nvidia has a vision of owning an AI factory or a stack ” he said.The company has created a whole ecosystem geared to AI — from networking technology to software. “They’ve basically shortcut the whole process ” Newman said.,btohqsg
i can't believe i skimmed through this,btohqsg
Meanwhile I bought nividia stock at 900+ and sold it at a loss at 800+ when it dipped  now it rose to a new high of 1060+ lol,btohqsg
is my multitasking skills coming back to me now,btohqsg
is ur luck normally good or bad,btohqsg
It’s because I stupidly thought it wouldn’t keep rising and I bought it at the peak,btohqsg
I need to buy and hold long term,btohqsg
But anyway I’ll stay away from now I’ll just play safe and stick to index funds like the S&P,btohqsg
not even talking about you 😒,btohqsg
Yeah and also it’s a bit hard to tell when stocks are overvalued,btohqsg
I think it can still rise a bit more but it’ll inevitably dip,btohqsg
Warren buffet likes to buy during bear markets,btohqsg
His advice is be greedy when others are fearful,btohqsg
But fearful when others are greedy,btohqsg
What event cld trigger that tho,btohqsg
Unless blackwell somehow doesnt sell wwll,btohqsg
Might get a fide id ngl,btohqsg
Just more positive sentiment or another record earnings,btohqsg
But it won’t keep going up some days there can be a sell off for no clear reason,btohqsg
Also if interest rates keep remaining high it could dip,btohqsg
Do u play at any local clubs?,btohqsg

if I forgot to take my money out my pockets and put it in the vending machine is it ‘money laundering’,btohqsg
Because now the money is gone,btohqsg
Public companies don't work like that,btohqsg
Yes they are owned by Bezos but in that token if I buy a share of AMZN on NYSE I also own Amazon along with like millions other ppl who hold their stock,btohqsg
He gets money from dividends when amazon distributes them,btohqsg
Dividends are profits distributed to shareholders,btohqsg
Not the complete picture also cuz Bezos gets Restricted Stock Units and Options which he can excerise,btohqsg
I thought restricted stock units are part of employee compensation tho?,btohqsg
He can excerise the options and basically effectively print new shares and sell off shares to main the same percentage ownership,btohqsg
So its more of active income rather than passive?,btohqsg
Yep and it's better than that,btohqsg
Because he can loan his shares as collateral to a bank and get capital that way,btohqsg
I just finished reading a business book that's why I asked,btohqsg
All while keeping his ownership at the same percentages,btohqsg
Who here got into nvda before earnings call,btohqsg
Like 75% i read properly lol,btohqsg
The book focuses more on network marketing,btohqsg
Which I feel is quite an interesting business model,btohqsg
But I js got no time and effort rn fr,btohqsg

The OG Engineering seems to be replaced by CS and Computer Engineering now...,btohqsg
Is pretty much stem and design thinking and Abit of dnt,btohqsg
Quite interesting that SMU Computer Science is the one topping tho instead of NTU and NUS.,btohqsg
Well according to the article (yea I know it said top 25%),btohqsg
I think it's more towards the trend CS are more desirable degree. With better entry salary.,btohqsg
Also  is there really a housing crisis in Singapore... until homeowners need to illegally partition out the bomb shelter as a coffin room 😢 ?https://johor.chinapress.com.my/?p=1196612,btohqsg

SMU always was focused on Graduates outcome and imo the only thing u go to SMU for is the networking and their career office. Idk about NUS but anyone who is from NTU can attest to the incompetence that is NTUs CAO... also NUS and NTU more research focus.,btohqsg

Clinics in Singapore are ramping up resources to cope with the rising number of patients with COVID-19 and other illnesses.Doctors are also urging people to stay up to date with their vaccinations:https://cna.asia/4aBc16g💉When did you last receive a COVID-19 jab?,btohqsg
Just curious tho  how many Singaporeans actually drink directly from the tap?,btohqsg
50 cents SGD I expect atleast have ice cubes or atleast chilled as a Malaysian 😂,btohqsg
didn't even consider boiling it? haha,btohqsg
but my family still boils water,btohqsg
by human nature I will still boil it in a kettle and let it cool down  unless it has another indoor filter system.,btohqsg
I went to UK  and EU  damn their tap water is hard water lol,btohqsg
the eu the tap water is like shit,btohqsg
it is the too much mineral build up that's the bad part. lol.,btohqsg
They need to be passed through something called a Brita Filter or something to atleast make it drinkable lol,btohqsg
the filter system that removes cl2,btohqsg
only reason it won't be ok to drink tap water in most of europe is if your gut can't handle it  which is more of your body not being used to it,btohqsg
or you just don't like the taste,btohqsg
Would be funny if it was the same restaurant as where i did it,btohqsg
I was eating vegetarian mala and i bought their iced water for 50 cents  but drank it too fast and i wasn't gonna bother paying another 50 cents so i walked to their washing hand tap area and refilled my cup,btohqsg
I got water for $1 before,btohqsg
but it was one of those Japanese places so uhh makes sense,btohqsg
