Ioniq 5 N: An EV track machine done rightDriving the Ioniq 5 N at Mandalika International Circuit has convinced me that Hyundai has got the EV track machine recipe down.‚û°Ô∏è Read itHERE!üëâüèª Ioniq 5 for the track üöó,btohqsg
Kah motors pricing itself out of competition ü§™,btohqsg
Buy civic might as well go for eu market,btohqsg
A5 sportsback is around that price range too,btohqsg
A5 cannot run 250k mileage without overhaul onceüòÇ,btohqsg
Okay jokes aside but yes JDM is priced so high until it doesnt make sense,btohqsg
If the price not significantly diff why not go for badge w status lmao,btohqsg
It doest make sense at all now,btohqsg
Civic really the price jaw dropping,btohqsg
Just a mid size sedan like mazda 3,btohqsg
At least Camry is a big sedan so is arguable at that price range. But civic is another story,btohqsg

it better not be a detuned civic,btohqsg
Bread and butter car becomes like this price,btohqsg
Is all because of coe also,btohqsg
Wait till U see the Accord price,btohqsg
Not exactly also. If Avante Hybrid can price itself at 180k  I don't see why Honda cannot,btohqsg
Even Mazda 3 M Hybrid also not so ex,btohqsg
Honda is like trying to create a new category on its own,btohqsg
Although Altis and Corolla Hybrid is PI and looks very dated  it's still a practical choice,btohqsg
The Altis Hybrid GR Sport is very sporty,btohqsg
But the new civic hybrid looks quite powerful also haha,btohqsg
But still is only a civic haha,btohqsg

LBX  CLA  C class all cheaper than Civic,btohqsg
219K civic want to say spacious not really  219K can buy alot of big family car,btohqsg
Overall is still a civic haha for 219K madness,btohqsg
Interior of new civic so so only only change abit haha,btohqsg

But the MSRP for the newCivic is only 28K USD,btohqsg
Our civic is made in thailand,btohqsg
Cars anywhere else in the world is cheaper than Sg,btohqsg
Yup  so what makes the car expensive are the taxes and coe in sg?,btohqsg
