Abundance BBs did a gap-up open at 32 yesterday. Price has been maintaining at 32 33 yesterday for most of the day and we see 32-33 today also.  BBs seem to be in control of the price but what i know from last week at 38-39 levels seem to be sellers unloading.  33 is an interesting breakout point to watch.,btohqsg

For some reason I think ABUNDANCE got chance â€”â€”-It is a niche (relatively low volume) specialty chemical that OSC has become one of the most active traders of in China  selling it in the country as well as overseas  according to Abundance MD Sam Kok Yin in a 1H17 results briefing.The chairman of Abundance owns one of thelargest ethanol production plants in Chinaand supports OSC by buying some raw materials and selling some products through OSC. (SOUNDS FAMILAR)This relationship and the larger volume enables OSC to negotiate better terms from suppliers and customers  a synergy that contributes to OSC's profitability.With 1H17 being a positive period for OSC  and assuming that business stays stable  the 2H could be more positive as more working capital becomes available and a wider range of chemicals is traded.,btohqsg
Abundance prob is major shareholders keep selling,btohqsg
Gke nv go 9c it wnt set a base. Drops real fast  all the time,btohqsg

Those shareholders want sell sure got PEOPLE ABSORB MOST IMPORTANT the MD -Sam Kok Yin  of Abundance International: Was a corporate lawyer in Singapore before turning investor and running companies. From Feb 2011 to Dec 2011  he was the Deputy Chairman and CEO of Sun East Group (renamedCEFC International)  a Singapore listco.
