When I first buy car also like that,btohqsg
0.1 off will not give me peak grip! thats very dangerous!!!!!,btohqsg
I know right!! Hahaha I guess it’s a journey everyone goes through?,btohqsg
I notice a lot of times what people do to their cars it’s for mental song one  especially in our city driving.,btohqsg
Like hobby ba… as a stress reliever,btohqsg
Like diy car wash? My neighbour wash from 8am to 2pm. Not sure is car serve him or he serve car.,btohqsg
You can now reserve your Model Y from Tesla SingaporeOpt for the dual-motor variant and you'll hit the speed limit from a standstill in less than 3.7 seconds!🚗💨👉🏻 React with ❤️ if you love all things Tesla!👉🏻 React with 🥰 if the Tesla Model Y is your kind of car!➡️Read ithere!,btohqsg
It’s really true. Really like a hobby in a way coz in our climate … one hour sunny  next hour storm. 😅,btohqsg
"No. it is on the e30. the m3 already has lowered suspension because it is ""competition pack"".the e30 has terra springs when i bought it. previous owner lowered it",btohqsg
ok. Volvo mentioned here. outsells bmw!,btohqsg
"""Today  as compensation  I had a test drive with the Tesla Model Y Performance from the new production in Grünheide (Berlin). Quite nice acceleration but I find it unemotional and boring.""",btohqsg
yeah. they delayed delivery of his Giulia QV,btohqsg
I guess it’s all very subjective bah! Still good lah!,btohqsg
yeah subjective. he is all about sound. i know him,btohqsg
I bet model y top sales in 2022 for ev,btohqsg
Model y is the tipping point for a lot of ice ppl to convert to ev,btohqsg
I see the Hyundai EV6 also quite nice,btohqsg
Tesla know Singapore like slow car   model y rwd is in Singapore hahah   whereas other country lowest modelIs long range,btohqsg
"""panel gaps"" not present anymore for german Y. of course they wont let this happen. embarassing for german built cars.",btohqsg
Suv is actually a hatchback + height increase but u pay a lot more,btohqsg
for me i will pick sedan,btohqsg
That why those car like gla sell like hot cake,btohqsg
Go model y claim the top sales,btohqsg
Don’t need to pay for ads   pi do free ads,btohqsg
Berlin don’t have standard range all are duel motor,btohqsg
Singapore like slow car just for them,btohqsg
sure. ver there. performance is standard. fast highway driving a must,btohqsg
So unless we spec the dual motor then we can get the Berlin made one?,btohqsg
Mr Xun can consider for his doggos,btohqsg
berlin made for euro region sales. they wont do for asia,btohqsg
Cause we right hand drive also,btohqsg
Major market are all left hand drive,btohqsg
china is left hand drive. for prosimity  it makes sense that shanghai makes cars for us,btohqsg
So all model Y we get are from Shanghai ?,btohqsg
Shanghai do for Singapore hk Australia and hk for export I think for the mod y,btohqsg
Damn I honestly was looking forward to seeing the Y from Germany.,btohqsg
Time to buy more tesla shares,btohqsg
And Singapore don’t have the 7 seater model y,btohqsg
Mode y is so big can put in 7 seater,btohqsg
Chinamen all now holding on to cash,btohqsg
Let see how model y flood the road,btohqsg
Don’t know what will happen to ix3,btohqsg
That will be a hotly contested ev market segment,btohqsg
No competition currently to model y,btohqsg
Haha Mr X  so many people buy but nobody buy for me....,btohqsg
Polestar 3 look good and is on full ev platformNot ice concert,btohqsg
There will always be those who don’t want to buy what many others are driving sir,btohqsg
we shall see ba  hopefully doesnt cross 240k without coe,btohqsg
So far I only see polestar 3 able to at least compete with model y,btohqsg
The others are kinda like a joke like ix3,btohqsg
Even China EV better than this polestar,btohqsg
it looks like a whale LOL,btohqsg
weather is good today. this translates to mean m3 time today,btohqsg
i dont like convertible. weak car,btohqsg

more flats will be empty if they dun reverse declining birth rate..... once baby boomers gone 1/4 of population gone,btohqsg
unless Xi welcome foreign talent like sg🤣,btohqsg
But ppl don’t want give birth as very high cost of living,btohqsg
That why xi is now using common prosperity policy,btohqsg
common prosperity is good for long term. they must correct this unfair imbalance,btohqsg
the youths are giving up due to the extreme prcie of properties,btohqsg
they got to crash the properties to show properties are not for speculation.,btohqsg
many rich ones buy properties to speculate. and do nothing waiting for price to go up. this got to stop,btohqsg
To me China policy is very good   in these like the property 3 red line policy to stop develoloper over profit and speculate   the education policy that make private tutor stop charging crazy price that is only for the rich,btohqsg
These policy really work and not alibaba 1,btohqsg
Even Thier car plate policy is so good,btohqsg
Give commoner a chance to own and use a car,btohqsg
Compare to us is like got money can liao hahaha,btohqsg
PRC will do all means necessary to make sure their kids got qing hua uni😂. I see PRC students parents in Sg I know liao. can come here without know English n ace our exams,btohqsg
china is very competitive. 1.4 bil. no joke. everyone want be at the top,btohqsg
They compete in all areas actually,btohqsg
Like in sg those in Chinese high compete in all areas,btohqsg
Thier daily life is how to excel and win Thier peers,btohqsg
everyone want to be number 1. but there's only 1 number 1😂,btohqsg
statistically 95 percent of the ppl will just be mediocre. so I dun push my kids too much... life is short... just do what your heart tells you,btohqsg

Actualy I am looking at the register car in April,btohqsg
Octavia omv is 2 plus k,btohqsg
How come shoot up so much in selling price lol,btohqsg
Omv is still 20 plus k,btohqsg
octavia RS OMV is 31k sir,btohqsg
This basic car wants to sell for 9k plus,btohqsg
I see an increase only in the COE,btohqsg
199k in feb to 215 now,btohqsg
Coe increase is only like 20 k difference,btohqsg
price difference also 20k? can see the price right there,btohqsg
Oh is rs I thought is the normal model,btohqsg
Rs don’t have have the ves rebate right,btohqsg
Ya for the basic cost right,btohqsg
Seems that rs more worthy it,btohqsg
Our car price is just so scary lol,btohqsg
depends on what one wants  DP and monthly do increase quite a bit between the two,btohqsg
for those who don't care too much about the driving dynamics  regular octavia works out,btohqsg
I think fc is very important for ppl just want a-b at a budget,btohqsg
As petrol price is so ridiculous,btohqsg
yupp  also for those who are really trying to calculate and stay within a monthly expenditure limit for their car,btohqsg
I think 99% of ppl have a limit on cars,btohqsg
Just how comfortable they want it to be,btohqsg
And how big their range can be in terms of maintenance and fuel costs,btohqsg
in case there are any unforeseen expenses,btohqsg
Actually thinking back   spending 200 plus k on a bread and butter car is kinda ridiculous,btohqsg
I mean an octavia isn't the regular bread and butter car as such,btohqsg
but yes  200k is a sizeable amount,btohqsg

the fk8r engine is impressive. 400 NM for 2 liter. same as the v8 m3,btohqsg
u just paste this on the door panel can alr,btohqsg
considering a megane rs 1.8that has 390-420nm depending on year of manufacture,btohqsg
this looks like some kind of thematic diagram used by geophysicists like they found some oil underground.,btohqsg
Just the difference in technology  you compare a civic from the same times as an e92 M3 and you see the difference,btohqsg
yeah low torque. but the power band is wide. lovely high revv,btohqsg
Turbo technology has come a long way and more power is being produced from N.A. engines as well now,btohqsg
m3 v8 4 liter is NA engine,btohqsg
insane really the people at renault,btohqsg
manage to get 420nm from a 1.8,btohqsg
No need to scold me what,btohqsg
i expect a large engine to have higher torque but it does not have,btohqsg
good sounding engine  more smiles per miles,btohqsg
i took it just now. it is intoxicating,btohqsg
i also tested the DCT. when i cruise it from 7th to come to a stop at toll station  it changes to 6th and then i rapidly slow down and it skips 5 and 4 and straight to 3 and then 2... nice,btohqsg
the mazda skyactiv is also smooth. transmission too. but it is slow changing,btohqsg
I mr@Cxspeedfanboy. Can own 2 m cars in Singapore. No easy feat,btohqsg
anyone can do. because i dont buy NEW,btohqsg
you guys and many here like to have new.,btohqsg

Gt63s 4matic using a 4.0 V8 as well now. 900nm torque,btohqsg
only one way to find out,btohqsg
Something a bit older  Ferrari 458 speciale with a 4.5l V8 with 540nm,btohqsg
Really about what age of car you're looking at and what it was designed for,btohqsg
W204 C63 6.2L V8 w 600nm,btohqsg
I know the sign for Maserati,btohqsg
And that's back in those days,btohqsg
i know  i like NA engine,btohqsg
no torque so can get smoked by everybody from 0-60,btohqsg
About same as m3’s 104. NA things,btohqsg
I love the over hung ups on torque numbers,btohqsg
They only tell but one side of an amazing driving experience and story around large CC NA cars like the 458  or w204 c63 or E9x m3,btohqsg
of course la. otherwise you can write off this engine maker,btohqsg
but the s65b40 v8 is lighter than ex- inline-6 engine,btohqsg
Lighter yet hp increase by more than 100hp over the last gen m3 as far as I have read,btohqsg
but many complain of reliability. like the infamous rod beartings and the failed plastic throttle actuator gears that melt! 😱,btohqsg
that is why i dont really want to drive often,btohqsg
i think roughly 80 bhp increase,btohqsg
the e39 v8 has 390 bhp,btohqsg
You guys never go car meet yesterday and today?,btohqsg
yur volvo makes no emotive sound? modify it,btohqsg
As they say  there’s no replacement for displacement,btohqsg
torque = Force (Newton) x Distance (m). increase either or both to get bigger Torque. turbo = bigger force. longer stroke = bigger distance,btohqsg
but longer stroke means rpm got to be lower,btohqsg
Nah. Has yours failed on you so far? Anyway just preventively change them out then as they’re <$1k parts cost alone if it concerns you. The throttle actuators also the same and you can always change to the metal gear ones and they are probably in the range of $2k or less I’m guessing?,btohqsg
bores gives larger torque since force produced would be bigger,btohqsg
To max power per cylinder you would probably want to max rpm  and many powerful engines would typically have large bores and shorter strokes,btohqsg
no. no failures. some did not experience failures.,btohqsg
Population failure rate seems to be less than 1% actually. And if preventive replacement doesn’t cost so much and timed with an engine oil change  it does seem wise to change it out for an absolute peace of mind many owners would feel.,btohqsg
And depending on year of manufacture  apparently bmw also upgraded the alloy coatings on the rod bearings on the LCI cars it seems?,btohqsg
after 2011 they seem to solve this problem with better bearings.,btohqsg
so wating for oil to heat up properly is key. it takes roughly 10 mins. i timed it again today,btohqsg
8.8 liters of oil. and thick 10w60 oil,btohqsg
an then when you come back after lunch brerak of one hour or so  the oil temperature doesnt really show ready. wat again. but roughly 3 mins.,btohqsg
On the throttle actuators  the two banks of throttle actuators driving the individual throttle bodies generally don’t melt per se but more commonly with time  the plastic gears actually doing the throttle actuation do slip and spin  while not opening the throttles. Some owners upgrade to metal gears  while others change them out every 3-4 years. Cost each is probably slightly more than S$1K.,btohqsg
nah i dont care. my car only has 78K km,btohqsg
That’s cool too! Good if everyone understands background facts. Urban legends can be so scary sometimes.,btohqsg
At least you seem to care enough to take the effort and time to wait for the oil temperatures to warm up properly each time 👏🏻 👏🏻,btohqsg
That is indeed good practise! 👍🏼,btohqsg
i am ALWAYS careful with that - for ALL my cars,btohqsg
i have good habits.1. i dont rest my my foot on clutch pedal2. i don't floor gas pedal3. i dont hold steering wheel at 6 o clock like some i know do...4. i revv only when engine is hot (engine oil hot),btohqsg
plus  the most important habit...i DO NOT revv engine without load at neutral,btohqsg
6 oclock? I have better things to hold at 6 o clock than steering wheel,btohqsg

Musk is a ang mor with Asian work ethics.,btohqsg
Scary when country manager becomes non essential ..,btohqsg
It's an easy way for him to layoff ppl without having to pay them severance,btohqsg
But role eliminated so no replacement will be found,btohqsg
Don’t plan on our extremely high monthly incomes being guaranteed for the period of car loan 😂😂,btohqsg
Won't be clear. Because now the ones flooding the roads and buying up coes are the PHVs and other car rental companies,btohqsg
Not even my favourite drinks stall aunty's assistant,btohqsg
People are still gonna be traveling  if they don't buy cars  roads will still fill up with more buses and more cabs,btohqsg
If you do see the COE going that high and people not buying cars,btohqsg
But that won't happen because the buying power of certain sections of society does increase as well,btohqsg

Sourcing for viewpoints. YR2021 Tiguan 1.4A TSI or YR2021 BMW X1 sDrive18i. Comments?,btohqsg
Tiguan will offer you more space  x1 has a good driving experience,btohqsg
but the interior can be abit drab ah,btohqsg
tiguan might feel slightly underpowered but it does the job well,btohqsg
2021 quite nice  got ambient lighting all,btohqsg
dosent make much of a diff in the day time tho,btohqsg
but x1 the 2.0 model is nice,btohqsg
but the idrive a bit more reliable than the newer VAG infotainment units as they develop in house now,btohqsg
The big companies don't want you to drive your own car they want you to drive their cars,btohqsg
Thanks for the replies. Yes  Tiguan has more space. The X1 will be the 1.5L not the 2.0L (petrol expensive!). Any concern about reliability of the Volks these days? wet/dry DSG,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to search up my fine for fuel check? Can’t seem to find on axs,btohqsg
i think the recent dsg is quite solid haha,btohqsg
quite solid nowadays. just need to maintain properly  don't skip on gearbox services as recommended by volkswagen,btohqsg
According to VAG they fixed the problems plauging the DQ200 dry 7DCT. But even after that  my friends Jetta GB gave way on CTE,btohqsg
weather too hot in Sg ... wet ones might survive longer,btohqsg
tiguan 1.5 shd be wet 6spd dsg,btohqsg
No clear indication if the tiguan 1.5 is wet or dry. That's probably the only thing that edges it towards the X1,btohqsg
Didn’t know it’s tagged to nric,btohqsg
cuz they know sgean change cars often hahah,btohqsg
oh yeah i was thinking of the old 1.4tsi,btohqsg
"Still pretty sad volks is still plagued with this ""unknown""",btohqsg
yeah so i think its 1.4 (old) vs 2.0 (new),btohqsg
oh crap which year was that jetta,btohqsg
wah help man my family was looking at a mk7.5 gti too haha,btohqsg
my friend's X1 burned down complete loss.. switched to 1.4 tiguan hahaha.,btohqsg
Not very familiar with VAG but the GB died in 2018,btohqsg

Of course shiok  shift very fast,btohqsg
But local traffic conditions don't work very well for DCT especially the creeping,btohqsg
Good lah  changed to Tiguan  and “upgrade” cuz it comes with signal lights,btohqsg
but not dsg so dunno how that plays out,btohqsg
All forms of DCT not recommended to creep,btohqsg
nvm la the drive is addictive haha,btohqsg
Drive 3 years then change car lol,btohqsg

Book in workshop mon-fri  sat and sun then can use 😉,btohqsg
Solution is to create a separate COE category for cars meant for PHV rentals for EV/HEVs,btohqsg
Cat F for EV  it can go to the moon,btohqsg
They won't separate PHV and normal cars because the idea is to limit car population  so the common man on the street gets to compete with the big corporations like grab and gojek,btohqsg
last time teksi was same pool.,btohqsg
Phv too open already ma  so now let then ownself fight ownself,btohqsg
phv buying car more expensive  soon the fare will woo hoo huat ar!,btohqsg

"buy used is like"" opening a box of chocolate  u Neva know wat cha gonna get"".",btohqsg

used car DEP higher than new car often,btohqsg
Yes this is true recently in the last couple of years,btohqsg
but some ppl only think about the initial down payment or full cash,btohqsg
such as? compared with one 3 years ago,btohqsg
There’s a big difference. From design to engine to interior n performance. Every thing,btohqsg

He say rent car must maximise the rental by doing as much mileage as possible. Abt 600km per day,btohqsg
well if he is spending so much time in the car  it would be nice to have some style on the outside and inside,btohqsg
He say want to impress ppl with stylish car,btohqsg

I mean  if you get an old corolla altis coming to pick you up vs an alphard or something nicer,btohqsg
definitely get impressed by the alphard,btohqsg
good for customers  some drivers i've interacted with say that it is important for them to have a nice car that is spacious  newer and good on mileage as it keeps customers happy  gets good ratings and is also a deterrent for customers to cancel rides if they are getting a nicer car coming,btohqsg
What is there to impress when u even need to Collect taxi fare ?,btohqsg
I don’t get impressed. I’m wondering if he is ok to rent so much when a broken car can earn the same cab fare,btohqsg
Yup. The fare is the same if he use a broken car,btohqsg
Bottom line is if u collect fare means u need money and can’t impress,btohqsg
Ya some ppl want to impress n do phv same time. End up break even can’t earn,btohqsg
Why even need to earn the fare if one is rich,btohqsg

harder to find an E92 M3 to rent all around Europe,btohqsg
