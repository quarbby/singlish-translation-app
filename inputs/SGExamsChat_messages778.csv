So I end up procrastinating on the detention itself,btohqsg

I left secondary in 2019 right before covid hit,btohqsg

Cannot even go buy food independently we daily had a food list and person of the class went down to pick up the food for specific stalls,btohqsg
And then settle payment based on list,btohqsg

We just awkwardly stayed in class waiting for the food to be delivered like a quarantine patient.,btohqsg
covid feels like a fever dream,btohqsg
It was the start of even the measures themselves so it was damn strict and chaotic cuz April intake for Hnitec,btohqsg
April 2020 is not a good time.... Orientation class advisor comes in be like ok so for 2 weeks u ain't gonna set foot in ITE stay at home u cough u gg,btohqsg

they did it back during sars,btohqsg
I had to rush to get a laptop for like 1k it was a shitty acer,btohqsg
i used some broken thinkpad frm my dad,btohqsg
Took 2 weeks for the request to even go thru also since it's CB the request took double the time,btohqsg
And don't even think got enough to loan,btohqsg
I don't think they had enough inventory for that,btohqsg
End up the stopgap was use phone to access blackboard,btohqsg
If no Internet access they loan u a wireless router for 10 or 15 bucks,btohqsg
Think so.. one of my mates did that he said it is like those travel router things,btohqsg
U press it basically gives u a hotspot,btohqsg
We didn't even get uniforms till Sem 2,btohqsg
Ya but I think ITE covered that,btohqsg
it used to be 7.25 lol,btohqsg
Damn we going international with this one,btohqsg
I had a school rule before that even if reporting time was 730 by 725 they stopped students because u were supposed to strive to arrive early,btohqsg
Needless to say that rule was scrapped very quickly.,btohqsg

Then the last 5 min the majority of girls start turning up,btohqsg
The real power play is showing up early for slient read and bringing the most controversial book,btohqsg
I got my first detention with Mein Kampf,btohqsg
My school did not even bother to check if people bought reading materials,btohqsg
oh ya btw  did ur sch have smtg called 'morning worksheets',btohqsg
Some people literally just slept on their bags,btohqsg
They did when Hitlers face is printed on the book with a swastika,btohqsg
All I know is people bringing phamlets as reading materials,btohqsg
they made us do el ws at 7 in the moring,btohqsg
Smlj my brother from hai sing he never had that,btohqsg
But then again he was in the batch with the scandal principal,btohqsg
My school literally could not care less  I saw ppl bring hentai before,btohqsg

And literally saw Teachers walk by and nobody gave a shit,btohqsg
Damn long ago 12 years ago? Around there,btohqsg
Felt like my school could not care less honestly,btohqsg
Felt it since the day I stepped into the school and felt the same 5 yrs later,btohqsg
Thing is.. I didn't stop even with detention,btohqsg
Just one of those sec schools with a majority of demotivated Teachers  and even worse demotivated leaders,btohqsg
I brought 13 reasons why after and I believe it was when I brought fifty shades of grey that my parents got the phonecall,btohqsg
They were very apologetic in front of my teachers,btohqsg
But once the car door close they laugh their fucking ass off,btohqsg
My school did away with detention after a few years cause they felt like it was no use. My school also used to confiscate phones for 2 weeks,btohqsg
They got rid of it after a few yrs as well,btohqsg
My school confiscated phones too... I had 3 burners by sec 3,btohqsg
One was a Nokia flip phone,btohqsg
So basically for the last 3 years of My school  discipline was straight üíÄ,btohqsg
I rmb a rich kid bringing like 5 iPhones lmao  teacher confiscated 3 and she just brought out another one,btohqsg
Teacher took that and was frustrated  then she took out a 5th phone lmfao,btohqsg
The face of the teacher is something I wlll never forget for the rest of my life,btohqsg
sec 3 2.15 or 2.45 sec 4 3.45,btohqsg
She was literally hold a months pay of salary in her hands like damn,btohqsg

Your superiors got tell you covid got how many days leave nowadays ah,btohqsg
Mine said that no need to see doctor still,btohqsg
Just a test kit would do,btohqsg
Ok but tbh the 2 times I got covid in 2022 I went to see a doctor to prove my test is not fake so my art test results are in HealthHub,btohqsg
That was the guideline last time so if nothing changed should still be,btohqsg
After 2022 I never caught Covid again so my 3rd time might be coming soon,btohqsg
I supposed to come back tdy to find out rota posting,btohqsg
Actually no need to write on the test itself imo whenever I submitted it was I put my IC adjacent to it and write the date or just rely on the date stamp of the photo,btohqsg

Oh then did they believe him,btohqsg
I'm surprise after the uproar over the Ferrari incident  that caused the Chinese consulate to have to speak about that this thinking is still in sg,btohqsg

My sec sch need pay $300,btohqsg
It‚Äôs CO SYF. Have you seen the spread of results?,btohqsg
But they prorate for sec 4,btohqsg
No one person need to pay $100 + for training,btohqsg
I think i used edusave tho,btohqsg
In jh y1 everyone go for the training first before choosing the instrument,btohqsg
idk but alot of my friends in dhsco alr play since young,btohqsg
Is it coz majority of ppl came in w/o experience,btohqsg
Like there is distinction then accomplishment then commendation,btohqsg

How long should I wait for NUS  NTU and SMU uni application results to come out before applying to SIM? Applied to those unis and still haven't seen any results  despite it being late April. It's almost 100 bucks to apply to SIM though  don't want to waste the money on SIM applications or waste the chance to go to NTU  especially.,btohqsg
So apparently my dad told me that someone w straight As did not make it into pharm,btohqsg
So something w this intake that the cut off is p high,btohqsg
What are your results (RP or poly gpa ),btohqsg
Pharm sci is more competitive btw,btohqsg
Also its only apr now not may leh,btohqsg
Huh my dad friend daughter got AAA/A and didnt make it leh,btohqsg
Maybe she screw up the interview,btohqsg
No unless u are at the lower percentile of applicants,btohqsg
OhTbh i think you just wait a while more until may,btohqsg
I'm wondering if SIM would be better than going to Japanese language school to prepare for Japanese uni,btohqsg
imo it depends on the japanese uni uw,btohqsg
and do u want to stay in sg or live in japan after grad,btohqsg
What tier of Japanese uni could I realistically get?,btohqsg
cause if you want to live in japan  the japan uni is prob better,btohqsg
If at all possible  live in Japan,btohqsg
I hear NUS and NTU are well known enough in Japan though,btohqsg
wish eph still printed the 1000 qns o lvl,btohqsg
how will it sound like kuro,btohqsg
i think mayushii can answer ur qns btr cause he lives in japan but i cant ping him now,btohqsg
Can try one of those unis in the lesser-known states,btohqsg
The user name is white sendS?,btohqsg
Your gpa is quite low for waseda-tier schs ngl,btohqsg
lol no it was actually me,btohqsg
It's because of their more specialised industries,btohqsg
Which tier could I realistically aim for?,btohqsg
By SG standards  how hard are these papers?,btohqsg
Wait since everyone is talking abt concerts,btohqsg
Can invade ej and see the broken down facilities,btohqsg
cant comment on phys and chembio seems doable to me,btohqsg
Thrs alot of different concerts coming up,btohqsg
With someone doing breakdancing to kemusan,btohqsg
What's the std ur comparing with,btohqsg
Like are these supposed to compare with a levels or o levels,btohqsg
There's nth interesting or novel abt any of these qns,btohqsg
These are all ur standard qns that will come out in singaore a level exam,btohqsg
Streetsance is free but need register under an ejc email (I can help but only can max register 4),btohqsg
The mind the gap one ist,btohqsg
Maybe I go then I can spot valerie,btohqsg
Haven't had the time to rly look at chem or bio,btohqsg
its all mcq so i think should be doable,btohqsg
The Chemistry section is around H1 in difficulty but topics slightly broader,btohqsg
I ponning cca for it omegalol,btohqsg
as long as u got passion can one,btohqsg
Isit I tot it was just slightly harder o level,btohqsg
Like I feel an o level student can probably reasonably do the o level topic qns inside,btohqsg
they accept people with no background onesh is damn chill,btohqsg
I only know one 06 drama student,btohqsg
Requires more content than O level teaches. The questions are of the H1 content-based questions,btohqsg
I mean idk I feel the qns aren't that hard it's q like,btohqsg
still getting distinctions in everything ofc,btohqsg
hard to tellusually jh people join back + got JAEs also but all got background,btohqsg
Q15  16 and 20 are examples of questions that need knowledge beyond O levelQuestions are easy but  as said  requires knowledge that is beyond O level. That‚Äôs why I said H1 content based questions ‚Äî not application type,btohqsg
sh dsa very pickyevery year only accept 1-2,btohqsg
I feel that the topics tested is different from the difficulty of a paper,btohqsg
H1‚Äôs easiest type of questions bah,btohqsg
i feel its like o level physics with a twist,btohqsg
