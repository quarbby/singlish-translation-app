Go Dr Gearbox check. Plug into computer and check for fault code.If you have high usage  long HR driving. better change 20k KM.,btohqsg
Brake check is so lame lol,btohqsg
"you are using your imagination to justify change. is my driving"" conditions""  any different from yours?",btohqsg
my honda fit hybrid also change gear quite loudly. but people say its normal  still thinking if should do something about it or not,btohqsg
why dont you change it every month? 🤭,btohqsg
"dont try to ""act smart"" thnking what it should be. follow the manuals.",btohqsg
some gearbox is like that. my dct gives cklunking sound when it is slow. but then becomes smooth when engine is faster,btohqsg
Normal. Because Dual clutch. I'm also same engine and gear box with you.,btohqsg
It's not act smart.It advice by Gary's Engineering Mechanics and Dr GearBox.ATF not expensive.Clutch replace 3 500Of cos I listen to mechanic whom has 10 yr experience and overhaul hundreds of gearbox😂👍,btohqsg
I drove sienta 8 mth before.Clock 80 000km. No sound on gearbox. Maybe CVT spoil. Better plug into computer and check for fault code.,btohqsg
the work shop i going does not use computer,btohqsg
Gearbox is sealed. It doesn’t know humidity,btohqsg

Hi  for 1st time HDB season parking application  how soon can get it after submission? (Say not popular car park). Thanks,btohqsg
That’s right  immediate provided there is available slots at your car park for season. You can pay it just before exiting and it will show on the gantry,btohqsg

Is it wise to change the drive shaft to carbon shaft? I think this makes a big difference,btohqsg
