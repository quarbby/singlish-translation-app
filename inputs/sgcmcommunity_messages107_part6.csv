Which is powered by? You guessed it right  more fossil fuels :),btohqsg
that assumes they are empty when you need them,btohqsg
Tell u the truth  the carpark charges more ex than the nasi Padang,btohqsg
I already say you baller already loh sir,btohqsg
Sia lah now u confuse me.  Not civic mindedness meh? Civic lah!!,btohqsg
Eating nasi padang at@awj_mood's place comes with expensive parking,btohqsg
Dedicated lots right not for EVs when they are the minority,btohqsg
What happens when they're the majority,btohqsg
I think will overstretch  might really short circuit cus sudden surge of power,btohqsg
And malls don't want to put in too many chargers,btohqsg
The simple solution  in theory  is to have moveable chargers along the top of lots so that any car can charge and donâ€™t need to shift lot after charging,btohqsg
Then EVs queue up for lots and us in ICE vehicles get to pick whatever :),btohqsg
A moveable charger is definitely not going to be as fast as a fixed supercharger,btohqsg
Hahaha no choice  was there for event. Tried to redeem parking with my wife member card  but they track her phone location. U must be physically in the mall to redeem the ticket,btohqsg
I mean everyone is free to make their own choices and no right no wrong lah,btohqsg
So clever one???!!!!! What if you download and access her profile using the app?,btohqsg
Can redeem at the kiosk without checking though?,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s the plan. Hahaha encourage everyone to get ev while I hide in my coal burner,btohqsg
Yeah legit. Of ya didnâ€™t think of that hahaha. Will try that next time,btohqsg
I think last time can  now via app. Never tried before,btohqsg
So I use the kiosk usually,btohqsg
My wife says the kiosk not able to redeem anymore,btohqsg
Shall check it out again next time,btohqsg
Yes but I guess technology will catch up. Kinda like the eubiq chargers u know?,btohqsg
Jio me  can go eat nasi padang tgt lol,btohqsg
Hanor!!!!!!!!! We brothers open jio that morning!,btohqsg
Luckily not bmw again otherwise people sure straight jump at it one,btohqsg
Hahahaha this channel is on mute la. So many messages everyday. Pm me next time,btohqsg
Chaser is an a class though,btohqsg
Honestly wanna speed also speed safely lah wapiang. Tunnel so tight alr,btohqsg
I think maybe the road works contributed. Suddenly lack of space and then no time to react due to speed and crashed into someone else,btohqsg
oh yeah.. today roadworks was crazy..  saw alot while driving,btohqsg
"but still  use some common sense. now both flip -.-""",btohqsg
The chase car not involved. The k3 crashed with a Elantra I believe,btohqsg
Thanks for the charging station update. Shall take a deeper look. However  since Singaporean loves our Neighbours at the North  judging from the jams weekly  charging station in Malaysia is not that extensive. EVs owner game to make frequent trip up North?,btohqsg
Wah wah slightly wrapped Tesla with Sporrims!!!!!!!,btohqsg
Or hooorrrr!!!!!!!!!!! For me this channel is on Extra Loud wor ðŸ˜˜,btohqsg
what can I sayâ€¦ small d|ck mentalities and idiots without regard for other road users. If road and traffic conditions change just ease off already,btohqsg
Hope tp fine them jialat jialat,btohqsg
Amazing is both can walk out like nothing happened,btohqsg
Yes for sure.  And thank goodness they didnâ€™t harm innocent road users who did not ask for that risk to be put upon them by those dudes.,btohqsg
Guys  anyone know which website can show me which credit card gives the best disc at the petrol stns in sg? I rmb got one website have but i cant rmb the name,btohqsg
Currently best discount is sinopec with grab or lalamove,btohqsg
But if don't have those  sinopec with OCBC cards or Esso with UOB (I think) pretty good,btohqsg
best is jb go in empty. save 50 buck at least for small car,btohqsg
No time leh plus now customs checks quite spontaneous,btohqsg
really ah . I almost want to in I see today causeway not jam,btohqsg
I pump like once every 3 weeks... Not really bothered lol,btohqsg
so good I once a week,btohqsg
Esso is DBS right? They got a DBS ESSO card.,btohqsg
