For NUS  you can use your old application number and login here:https://myaces.nus.edu.sg/uasonline/Loginand it will show what you previously accepted under ‚Äúapplication status enquiry‚ÄùNot sure for the other unis  but you can check their own portals too to see if that works (not the joint admissions portal)!,btohqsg
