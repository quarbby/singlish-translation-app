Hi guys im new here. I some advice with you guys  if i want to do lalamove as part time. Which is the  recommended vehicle? Motor  car or van?,btohqsg
Do they require additional insurance like grabfood require?,btohqsg
Grabfood require additional food delivery insurance,btohqsg
if you doing grabfood  stay on grabfood. better,btohqsg
I dont do grabfood anymore. I thought i want to rent a van n do lalamove as part time after my fulltime job,btohqsg
not specified. but lalamove is more than food delivery so the food delivery memo doesnt cover it anyway. need proper commercial insurance for coverage. but llm doesnt require it when signing up.,btohqsg
Took abt near 2 hours tiring lol,btohqsg
Dunno how u all do those 7-8 places lol,btohqsg
