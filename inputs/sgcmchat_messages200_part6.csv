Similarly  the new Tesla Model 3 Highland is very lovely too  wonderful product minus the lack of indicators,btohqsg
i drove it 3 times… for quite the distance..,btohqsg
most EVs are shit. the eletre is an example of what makes EVs shit. upbadged  overweight  overpriced  and ugly with terrible efficiency. There are also good EVs but they are in the minority. Also a decent ICE shits over any EV,btohqsg
i don’t say EV is shit,btohqsg
EV is more or less the same as a petrol car,btohqsg
taycan  which i drove. model 3 because of how it changed the world. and most entry level BYDs because they are such great value for money,btohqsg
this is where i’m completely out,btohqsg
cos i hate ev’s w a passion,btohqsg
BYD… have you seen the issue where the BYD 12v battery will go flat without warning?,btohqsg
frankly i hate them too  even the good ones. cos they are all soulless appliances to me. but some drive really well and i cannot deny that EVs are very suitable for a large % of the driving population  just not enthusiasts,btohqsg
i wont argue the taycan and Model 3  both great cars too haha,btohqsg
do you really think any manufacturer is immune to defects? Do you know literally anything about Lotus and their history?,btohqsg
i will forever put it in a term  cars are mostly humanthey function just like usan electric car just takes out your heart  as if you had no soul,btohqsg
ev’s aren’t so good w majority of the population tbh,btohqsg
This is not a defect  this is a serious lack of thought when building the car’s software.,btohqsg
this is how an enthusiast thinks. most people driving cars dont give a shit what they drive as long as its powerful enough  reliable enough and economical enough. EVs can fill this void nicely as long as the v8s and v12s still exists  i dont care,btohqsg
the convinience and the maintenance is more important for a day to day driver,btohqsg
Long term  hybrid is not the answer haha. But for a daily commute in peak hour jam  i wld defo pick an EV.,btohqsg
in today's world i agree. but in 20 maybe 30 years pure EV will probably take it's place. sooner maybe in singapore where we can build the infrastructure quickly,btohqsg
the fact that an EV has as much emissions as a petrol engine,btohqsg
just because it’s a placebo doesn’t make it better,btohqsg
the best cars are still hybrids   driven economically,btohqsg
a lot of manufacturers are really fucking up hybrids too. did you see the latest M5? hybrid v8 and it weighs fucking 2.5 tons while having less performance than the old ICE M5,btohqsg
lol they only made the shift recently,btohqsg
before that they said the same thing,btohqsg
fuck the weather but love the weather,btohqsg
it matters haha  because the pollution is not visible to us… not our problem.,btohqsg
does it rlly matter. you dun touch grass anyway,btohqsg
lmao the guy who posted the eletre pics deleted them,btohqsg
sorry bro i was a little harsh i admit,btohqsg
but all cars deserve to be posted here leh hahahaha,btohqsg
can confirm i was just shopping in that mall a few hours ago,btohqsg
we need srt jeeps in sg bruh,btohqsg
some good hemi 6.4 to save the earth,btohqsg
that was pin worthy i’m surprised,btohqsg
https://www.topgear.com/car-reviews/lotus/eletrehave a read haha  it is good for what it is made to be,btohqsg
really low standards  reminds me of my ex,btohqsg
bro singapore got so many abang bro,btohqsg
u go haji lane cfm got a lot one,btohqsg
ok serious question now  what do you think is a fair price for a 2680kg made-in-wuhan EV in singapore  basically for what it is?,btohqsg
rabak… i ahneh u sure the racist want anot…,btohqsg
Price is a seperate issue haha  i am just saying i like the driving characteristcs as a car,btohqsg
not just any racist but the greatest,btohqsg
that is not how you assess a car,btohqsg
price to a car is assessed dependent on ur SES,btohqsg
here let me ask you  what do you think is a fair price for the eletre  valued fairly?,btohqsg
some wld spend 500k on a toyota  some wldn’t,btohqsg
i think anyone regardless of ses can assign what he feels is a fair value to a car,btohqsg
i know people who spend a SHIT ton of money on a 2008 Mazda,btohqsg
no leh… if i drive in UK… i care about how much the car cost in SG meh…,btohqsg
