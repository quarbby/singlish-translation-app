Any one tried before installing vep tag on the wind screen,btohqsg
But the ventilator seats on the driver side is a little weak. I set to max but it‚Äôs still a little weak. Most of the felt no sensation :(,btohqsg

Not sure what's the market price at the time,btohqsg
Anyway. Any idea with the ventilator seats?,btohqsg
Honestly no idea. I don't have this issue currently but my car 2023 so yeh,btohqsg
Maybe u can call hyundai to ask,btohqsg
Yea. When I send for servicing I ask them out hahah,btohqsg
ü§£ not obvious enough meh? Reliable + old tech = toyota lo. Hyundai is like samsung ma. New tech always updating FL here n there,btohqsg
Who know the size for the toyota stock 16 inch wheel cap,btohqsg

Bmw is a driver car tbh,btohqsg
If 1 pax driving most of the time its worth to get it. Else mercs is for passengers comfort,btohqsg

then mercs really expensive their parts,btohqsg
I also agree bm driving experience is real good better than merc. But bm no 7 seater suv... the GLB really dominate the suv mkt with this move,btohqsg
BMW is not a family car,btohqsg
