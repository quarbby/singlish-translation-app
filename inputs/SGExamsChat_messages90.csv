i try very hard to be nice to her every time we meet,btohqsg
idk why she's so angsty towards me,btohqsg
she has held the grudge against me for almost 2 years already,btohqsg
i just try to be nice to her  and she will pretend to be nice to be but is super passive aggressive,btohqsg
I'd suggest that you totally cut her off,btohqsg
"such as screaming stuff like ""i know she has sex"" to all my friends",btohqsg
if it's taking a toll on your well-being,btohqsg
no point sucking up to someone who will never accept you,btohqsg

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not a sergeant,btohqsg
John  what's the pay of sergeant vs recruit,btohqsg
You need to give the rotor combination lol,btohqsg
What's the highest rank a recruut can be within a year,btohqsg

Getting u acquainted with SAF efficiency,btohqsg
does the saf call pronounce it lieutenant or leftenant,btohqsg
But as a normal recruit leh  like just for 2 year Ns only,btohqsg
U only be a recruit for 2 months,btohqsg
So they promote u as time progress?,btohqsg
So what rank are u now,btohqsg
as of today im a recruit as well,btohqsg
Without being a commander  your rank at the end of NS could be between PFC (Private first class) to CFC (Corporal first class),btohqsg
Yeah I think I‚Äôm a private,btohqsg
Wtf pfc they never give that out,btohqsg
wgt get 950 at sgt  join SCDF get 900+ within your second month,btohqsg
my basic firefighting training pay is 900+,btohqsg
If i sit too long I could get deep vein thrombosis,btohqsg
ok bye back to doing my own stuff,btohqsg
Close enough la but you know who is saf commander in chief,btohqsg
We don't have any rank higher than 3 star,btohqsg
do people who serve SCDF in their NS  actually go on firefighting missions?,btohqsg
actually the logic is...this is similar to real life,btohqsg
Just like how nsfs who go to Air Force don‚Äôt actually fly plane,btohqsg
but I'm genuinely impressed  and I can see why SCDF are paid more,btohqsg
Funny thing is  when you Major and above  you rarely touch your gun.,btohqsg
More likely to get injured by paper cut,btohqsg
Neil say I most.likely going SPF sia,btohqsg
Neil is totally unbiased about SPF,btohqsg
He said I am the only child,btohqsg
Than only son sure go spfü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
That sounds like Attack on Titan: The best and most qualified soldiers go to the most innermost part of the city and away from the active fighting,btohqsg
"Similarly  the most ""experienced"" aka the high rankers are doing all the admin stuff",btohqsg
You aren't promoted to Major cause of your fighting skills,btohqsg
Well  my friend is only son but still go to army,btohqsg
Actually more because at higher ranks  you plan bigger scale operations  and you're needed on the ground much less.,btohqsg
The experienced at field ones are specialists,btohqsg
They get promoted up til warrant officers,btohqsg
So you aren't the only son,btohqsg
Does PES affect SAF SPF or SCDF?,btohqsg
Which still do occasionally go on the field,btohqsg
Officers go just to get experience only,btohqsg
My senior say those scholarship holder will go OCS,btohqsg

Captain will still go on field and fight quite often,btohqsg
How to apply for president scholar,btohqsg
too late for u  u can be a tiger mom/dad and make your child go through the perfect path though,btohqsg
One of the recent president scholars was from ACJC,btohqsg
I never join counsell before sia,btohqsg
then you must make all your friends nominate u for all those awards,btohqsg
Lol unless you from hci/ri you have very little chance anyway,btohqsg
"maybe can go for those ""intellectual"" seminars/conferences where ministers come and talk  and ask ""smart"" questions",btohqsg
Guess whose the first president scholar,btohqsg
world‚Äôs 1st robotics champion or some shit,btohqsg
Talking about psc is triggering me,btohqsg
Lee hsien loong go to Hwa Chong to celebrate Hwachong 100,btohqsg

Botak can also cut. But different kind of hair,btohqsg
Nus sent me a form to change my course,btohqsg
Basically I want to change my ddp from math and comp Sci to comp Sci and math,btohqsg
Idk why they put my home course as math lol,btohqsg
My pref was comp Sci to math,btohqsg
(watch as I do better in math than comp Sci in uni),btohqsg
Then wont u want ur home faculty to be math then,btohqsg
does it make a difference tho,btohqsg
AFAIK it makes a difference in one case,btohqsg
If I have/want to leave the ddp prog,btohqsg
Which tbh you should be allowed to choose which to drop,btohqsg
Wow deki oni if i could live as long to be loved by you üò≥,btohqsg
guys curious qn how do u change this,btohqsg
It was a qn on how to change flair I think,btohqsg
"What do you guys think is the difference between ""People with Disabilities"" and ""People with Special Needs""",btohqsg

Disabilities I usually associated with physical,btohqsg
^ actl wanted to say this,btohqsg
Numbers will fluctuate cos of the foreign workers living in dorms,btohqsg

Erm wait 1 day I'd suppose,btohqsg
Fine if you want I can forward the message for you,btohqsg
Oh wait nvm it's not worth it,btohqsg
How would you classify one with both then :P,btohqsg
are you talking to me? no right,btohqsg
Idw my rank points to be single digit,btohqsg
Yeah okay nvm I realised the message is just a secondary,btohqsg
ahh i understand it now HAH,btohqsg
0 RP is even more rare than 90RP,btohqsg
Are u using old or new reddit,btohqsg
uhhh how do i know that LOL,btohqsg
Ok that means you‚Äôre using the new one,btohqsg
Old reddit is when the URL begins with old,btohqsg
Anyone using new reddit want to help,btohqsg
Oof I was wondering why there‚Äôs 2 John,btohqsg
I thought this was the study group and someone needed help,btohqsg
Wait guys can y‚Äôall help me solve a p5 qn üò≠,btohqsg
Probably just something they need memorise,btohqsg
For any two relatively prime integers x and y  the largest integer that cannot be formed as a linear combination (ie ax+by) is equal to xy-x-y,btohqsg
It's called the Chicken McNugget Problem,btohqsg
Damn  why does p5 math require frobenius problem,btohqsg
My brother is way out of my league üôÑ,btohqsg
Yeah üòî when a p5 is smarter than his Sec 4 sister,btohqsg
Isnt it just prime or composite,btohqsg
No common prime factors between the two numbers,btohqsg
Ie 9 and 16 are relatively prime,btohqsg
Cause they don't share a prime factor,btohqsg
6 and 15 share a common prime factor of 3 so they're not relatively prime,btohqsg
Wait is it the coprime thing,btohqsg
Relatively prime means the number is just a little prime,btohqsg
Isnt it if both have the common factor of 1,btohqsg
Like that's the only cf that they can have,btohqsg
If they only have a common factor of 1,btohqsg
yeah coprime implies gcd of 1,btohqsg
What's gcd? My maths is crap,btohqsg
But gcd is easier to say,btohqsg
Time to invest in Œ≤-glycosidic hydolysing enzyme,btohqsg
Maybe I should have taken bio,btohqsg
I took physics for a year  retained  and took bio  and now I know nothing,btohqsg
Now u r a jack of both trades,btohqsg
Yeboi Gravity = mgh and photosystem 2 and 1 ya'll,btohqsg
Let non-contacts see your face irl irl üòîü§ôüèª,btohqsg
The glory of Neil‚Äôs countenance cannot be hidden,btohqsg
We have mastercoders and now we have masterbaiters,btohqsg
But its glory cannot compare to yours,btohqsg
Did u just call me an ‚Äúit‚Äù,btohqsg
I am but a humble smiley in a carpark,btohqsg
An disembodied smiley face lying on the road,btohqsg
Waiting to be trampled by humans and machines alike,btohqsg
A disembodied smiley face lying on the road,btohqsg
Yeet today I get to walk alone üé∂,btohqsg
You guys have no idea how satisfying it is to finally get some alone time,btohqsg
why do you not have alone time,btohqsg
They won‚Äôt leave me tf alone,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt have my own room lol,btohqsg
Imagine any sort of attraction to anything other than maths,btohqsg
Yall just need to open your eyes,btohqsg
Nothing happens when i open my eyes,btohqsg
If maths is cancer then why does cancer alliterate with Chem,btohqsg
Not if i have anything to say about it,btohqsg
Why is physics much more cancerous than maths and chem combined,btohqsg
Wood@chemcerlike to say a few words,btohqsg
U have summond him who shalnt be summond,btohqsg
My short friends are rift valleys and my taller ones are block mountains,btohqsg
For no reason other than it looks cool and sounds cool,btohqsg
why do you want to be in my lungs,btohqsg
High key want to just run away from home lol,btohqsg
she wants to take your breath away...,btohqsg
The fact that uk its konky means u arent as innocent as we thought,btohqsg
I'm still a little innocent boy then,btohqsg
Bold of u to assume john is innocent,btohqsg
He once said to me he konked an account,btohqsg
Wat on earth is breath play,btohqsg
So r u with choking on dumbling@ferrelcell,btohqsg
Posting and deleting messages doesn't make it okay,btohqsg
dont cite the deep magicks to me witch i was there when it was written,btohqsg
I didn't even know this was inside,btohqsg
Imagine being able to breathe. Where is my pre-photosynethetic-endosymbiosis gang,btohqsg
If breathing is konky  we must be pure,btohqsg
Just upload yourself onto a machine,btohqsg
Drive yourself from the temptation to engage in konk,btohqsg
Give in to the entropy not the konk,btohqsg
This is the best pun I‚Äôve made this year,btohqsg
We are already one with the universe,btohqsg
We are mere fragments of the universe,btohqsg
Okay this chat is too deep,btohqsg
Your guess is as good as mine,btohqsg
U are a dynamic pattern. Its time to be as static as the patterns of ur makers,btohqsg
gimme a sec i need context,btohqsg
I was thinking like kink but more like kronk,btohqsg
If you don't know it  you just haven't discovered it,btohqsg
Wait this reminds me i need to do smth,btohqsg
All patterns in the universe are dynamic,btohqsg
It‚Äôs just that we can‚Äôt tell,btohqsg
We all have something to do,btohqsg
Im in a state of entropy :/,btohqsg
We are just putting it off procasting in this chat,btohqsg
We all have a place in the universe,btohqsg
Woah what a great sticker pack,btohqsg
I wanted to add therefore symbol to my keyboard,btohqsg
The only name I know is Njboleh,btohqsg
We all know Njboleh‚Äôs real name is National JC,btohqsg
I need the forwarded message SIR,btohqsg
Fak u y u copy me,btohqsg
Check my linkedin my name is Boleh  NJ of course,btohqsg
Why would it be anything else,btohqsg
Nj boleh is a super cool dude,btohqsg
Fuck I just realized that I missed the opportunity to drink outside,btohqsg
but why do you need it...,btohqsg
I want to be able to type the text also,btohqsg
I read sqrt as squirt  I need an exorcist for whatever strange demon that lives in my brain,btohqsg
Or you know  a brain surgeon to remove the damned thing,btohqsg
At this point u might as well use legit latex commands,btohqsg
Then u can write in latex too,btohqsg
It's time to set up mathstackexchange but for sgexams,btohqsg
Or you know  have a Greek keyboard,btohqsg
It's just the main chat wym,btohqsg
Type an integral sign with Greek keyboard?,btohqsg
Is it time for a greek symbol converter bot,btohqsg
Lol what is this supposed to mean,btohqsg
I was wondering how he did it so fast,btohqsg
Oh that idk but it‚Äôs good enough for me lol,btohqsg
Or u can just fucking use text replacement,btohqsg
Lol it's an interesting concept tbh,btohqsg
That doesn't output in latex but replaces things like ^2 with small 2,btohqsg
Unless u want the bot to be able to edit msgs,btohqsg
Send a message to the bot  it gives you a message back that is edited,btohqsg
That's good enough for me tbh,btohqsg
Android u can just download custom keyboard even easier,btohqsg
Not everyone can be bothered to do that,btohqsg
What makes u think ppl would text a bot for that then,btohqsg
Texting a bot is easier than downloading an app and configuring it,btohqsg
But i would want to be able to convert it on the go,btohqsg
What if u want to edit,btohqsg
Ah well no harm designing it first,btohqsg
Thats why ppl should buy iphone,btohqsg
I should really get back to work,btohqsg
What if I have no skills,btohqsg
U can start with recrrence relations,btohqsg
I can then become admin in an online telegram group,btohqsg
I think thats one fo the criteria,btohqsg
U should start learning integrating factor and second order DE,btohqsg
Or you know  do something else that you‚Äôre interested in,btohqsg
100% of all owners of this telegram group know FMaths,btohqsg
How do u know what ure interested in. Unless u try it,btohqsg
Then try everything until you find something you like :),btohqsg
No longer bound by limitations and rules of an educational institute,btohqsg
The full quote is jack of all trades  master of none  but often times better than master of one,btohqsg
I become master of all trade thus becoming a master of one thing,btohqsg
Second order DE is in H2 maths,btohqsg
Maybe coz ur a fucking olvls student,btohqsg
Ever tot of it ? No cause u only think of urself,btohqsg
Watching a real mathematician doing an algebra question,btohqsg
Imagine thinking something can be ‚Äúreal‚Äù,btohqsg
20D is at it's at yoyo,btohqsg
Also why is betting services not essential,btohqsg
Not second order linear homogenous DE,btohqsg
U r needed in olvls group,btohqsg
this reminds me of you spin me right round baby right round like a record baby right round right round,btohqsg
I talking about the fmath version,btohqsg
Not the one in h2 math,btohqsg
I will see when the time comes,btohqsg
I need to think what i wanna pursue first,btohqsg
What if i want to go nursing,btohqsg
And my course dh this maths,btohqsg
There‚Äôs always a place for Maths in your life,btohqsg
Sir wait i have to solve this differential equatiom to derive,btohqsg
This can't be closer to the truth,btohqsg
I am still looking for it,btohqsg
So you are indeed a xmm,btohqsg
