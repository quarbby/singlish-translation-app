https://www.ocbc.com/personal-banking/cards/rewards-cardOcbc rewards 6mpd for 5309 and 5311 extended to Dec 31 2024.,btohqsg
It is a decreasing interest rate environment,btohqsg
Time to move on to moomoo 6.8%,btohqsg
Guess they dont have much mcc for that card to choose from lol,btohqsg
UOB Smart. So people cannot empty account in December and join new promo coming Jan 2025? üòÖ,btohqsg
It's a calculated move by UOB. üòÜ,btohqsg
"Just realized the name is ""Nation of Savers"". No more big or rising  loud kind of name.",btohqsg
How do I find out what categories I have selected for uob lady‚Äôs?,btohqsg
Same lo.Simultaneously or rotate. End up still fall into UOB trap ü™§,btohqsg
If I emptied out my UOB One account on 1 June  I can transfer in $150k today (1 July) to be considered as fresh funds or should I be kiasu and transfer in on 2 July haha,btohqsg
Good luck. Pls provide dp. ü§£I‚Äôm doing on 2nd July lol.,btohqsg
What is the difference if doing on 2 July?,btohqsg
U kiasi then do 2nd July (31 days from 1st June),btohqsg
Quick reminder that Moomoo 6.8%*p.a. is ending tonight 21:59H on 1 Jul 2024 for those existing users who have not participatedhttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/188607,btohqsg
Y'all can try and provide dp. UOB one very specifically put 30 days beforepromotion period(1 Jul). Unlike HSBC.,btohqsg
Then promotion period is 1st July.Put 1st or 2nd no different liao leh.,btohqsg
I won‚Äôt risk it. Especially if can be skirted by waiting one day n putting in $155k?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm even more chicken. I‚Äôm using a human that has $1k since May 2024.,btohqsg
Yah I think I do this,btohqsg
1.9 ‚ÄúPromotion Period‚Äù means the period from 1 July 2024 to 30 September 2024  both dates inclusive.1 July 2024  you put funds into UOB One which day will affect promotion period meh? ü´§,btohqsg
not sure what u asking but refer to 2.9,btohqsg
"1.6(iii). ""30 days before or during the Promotion Period"". Covers D-30.",btohqsg
I‚Äôm looking at eligible fresh funds.,btohqsg
Yes. This is what I‚Äôm looking at.So if promotion period is the period set out fixed by UOB. Then 1st of July willl forever be 1st of July this promo starts.And rewind by 30 days. 1st Jun is the date within 30 days.If you withdraw  means likely UOB can disqualify you liao.,btohqsg
As long as above mab of June 2024. Means fresh funds.But watch out for 1.6.iii which excludes amounts that left Uob from 30 days before promo period. Which technically is 1st June 2024.,btohqsg
"Not really disqualify  but any amounts withdrawn will be counted as ""ineligible"". We still have no dp on this.Would appreciate if someone update from previous promo. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",btohqsg
Yup. Hope UOB don‚Äôt chek ark ah‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Hence me chicken:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/214243Safer but not 100% assured. Since I mentioned this account also had salary in/out within May 2024. Hence I say the tnc is senseless.,btohqsg
Unless u want to use the highest watermark level of the account + $150 000,btohqsg
Need to find someone who not chicken and put on the dot ü§£,btohqsg
Means UOB can say you withdraw $150k in 1st Jun  now you need $300k in order to have $150k counted as fresh funds‚Ä¶ üò¨ü•πüòÇ,btohqsg
Hi  is there any ways to check which category my uob ladies card is on right now?,btohqsg
Flip table. December empty everything wait for 2025 üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes. And watch out for the salary credit in December itself!,btohqsg
Cannot. You're still earmarked until mid December.,btohqsg
I thinking. Still got 23 hours to gamble that $1 100.,btohqsg
This actually causes each player to only take part once every 3 cycles,btohqsg
Oh ya. Theres still this $1600 salary credit thing hor.Damn dumb. Everything cluster together. Last time think EGA complicated  now UOB also like that.,btohqsg
If earmark mean successful liao. No need flip table already. üòÜ,btohqsg
But‚Ä¶. I feel they talk only. Won‚Äôt enforce.But if u can play chicken. Otherwise just try and see if earmark fails or not Loh. U still get 4% pa nevertheless,btohqsg
A question about SCB bonus saver account... My company salary account cut off date is 10th... So i didn't open it in late June as it requires salary credit.,btohqsg
I'm thinking to open the account now to get company prepared for salary credit. Meanwhile  i would like to check if i can deposit fresh fund into bonus saver at the end of July? Or must deposit within some time range to get the signup and save up level up cashback?,btohqsg
A bit turn off by the longer earmark. given the risk of UOB One getting further nerfed while stuck in earmark.,btohqsg
You have 2 calendar months to do so,btohqsg
That is great.I just read through again the tnc for both campaigns.The save up level up should be easy. Putting fund by end of July will consider july as finding month.The signup cashback tnc tells need to deposit 50K 'immediately when opening account'. I am  afraid of this one like how immediately it requires ü§£.,btohqsg
You are given 2 calendar months to clock the salary portion. Minimum deposit must be on the account opening day  maintained for 2 months.Best to do it on 1st of month so you can clock both at the same time.,btohqsg
For UOB new promo  if Jun MAB is 150k  how possible to join the new promo?,btohqsg
have another sum of money to put in another uob account?,btohqsg
Can only have a uob one acct to each person  right? How to pit in another?,btohqsg
Emptied my uob one acct yesterday at 11pm fingers crossed.,btohqsg
