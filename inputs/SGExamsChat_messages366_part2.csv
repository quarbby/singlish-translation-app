"all these ""show offs"" are just waiting for SEAB to warn them ü´£",btohqsg
i mean youcanalways work it out on writing papers... why do on the paper itself?,btohqsg
showing people you can get hold of the QP,btohqsg
It is when your family members decided that Gwendolyn is too long  and decided to shorten it to Gwyn  but its pronounced  ‚ÄúGwen‚Äù. And then you grow up with everyone teasing you that your parents made a typo with their fat fingers or something.,btohqsg
Idk but I‚Äôm happy they posted it along with the QP last year ü•π,btohqsg
hao ran is A math god.,btohqsg
Do you just have a data base of observations of everyone you talk to,btohqsg
I have database in my brain,btohqsg
He doesn‚Äôt have any data on me so I‚Äôm safe,btohqsg
he is just......... a walking storage... TYS and database...,btohqsg
His username reminds me of the grey‚Äôs anatomy episode where they labelled George O‚ÄôMalley double o 7 of the batch of interns within the first two episode  because he messed up an intern appendectomy surgery.,btohqsg
Antsy for the paper to ruin your brain with the spam that badly?,btohqsg
You think? You‚Äôre not safe from my collective data base of observations of you either.,btohqsg
You‚Äôre not safe from my collective data base of observations,btohqsg
how is your English so good,btohqsg
I do know that you‚Äôre a or at least have been a JC lit student.,btohqsg
But yeah  ur eng is good :)@GwynLim,btohqsg
Wait do you not take Amath?,btohqsg
Yeah I realised that was a dumb question,btohqsg
Used to. But dropped it. Because its impossible to type it out on the phone.,btohqsg
Wait you dropped out because it was hard to type it out on phone o-O,btohqsg
Wait so were u good at amath?,btohqsg
I‚Äôve only heard of ppl dropping cuz their foundations are weak or they just hate amath,btohqsg
Gee  why didn‚Äôt I think of that in the first place?,btohqsg
This world is not ready to handle complex accessibility needs of students,btohqsg
Extensively. My AA is like 73 pages.,btohqsg
Too complex for my teachers to understand,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt exactly hire a scribe to help me do it 24/7.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not exactly at liberty to disclose the exact details  but yes  enlarged prints amongst other things.,btohqsg
use laptop? i had AA student who used laptop to type,btohqsg
some student need laptop to type,btohqsg
Oh I understand why u dropped it now,btohqsg
that why their exam is longer.,btohqsg
I used to use keyboard to type out the solution and it tedious,btohqsg
I have this guy that uses laptop to type got his English paper,btohqsg
Laptops aren‚Äôt exactly the most accessible for me either. I can‚Äôt use my range of muscles that widely and my scoliosis doesn‚Äôt exactly make it easy for me to use any desk.,btohqsg
I‚Äôm waiting to hear about it.,btohqsg
what happen to you  if you dm saying,btohqsg
You have AA to only type out your solutions to questions right,btohqsg
I could‚Äôve used my laptop  but SEAB doesn‚Äôt exactly legitimately recognise software that allows you to remotely control and hack your own device.,btohqsg
Do you have a photographic memory,btohqsg
Did you mean the final answer or,btohqsg
so you exempted from practical also?,btohqsg
even with AA application? that sucks,btohqsg
I was exempted from oral for English,btohqsg
Professionals tried to apply for that AA for other clients  too. Its just not permissible.,btohqsg
oh so u not school candidate,btohqsg
We considered that  but realised that the field of vision is too wide.,btohqsg
for me I can see A4,btohqsg
I started public school for secondary school.,btohqsg
