heard of it before. race cars all have one,btohqsg
personally for me  it helped with idle and general drivability. but mine is old car lah  the starlet which is carbureted. for 1 year plus we drove it thinking got issues with the carburetor cos it idles badly and falls flat on its face if u give throttle but after fixing the grounding all ok le... my guess is smth to do with the spark plugs since that car not much electronics but not too sure... just happy its more drivable ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
