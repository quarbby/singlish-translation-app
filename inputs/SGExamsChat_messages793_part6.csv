Explainer: Why netizens are blocking A-list celebrities on social media for being silent on the war in GazaBlockout 2024 is a new online movement that targets celebrities who are seen as being insensitive or even supportive of the atrocities being committed in Gaza.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://tdy.sg/44JeTN7,btohqsg
I am reminded of how some Chinese celebrities were lambasted for not rallying behind One China. So tough being a celebrity ‚Äî they‚Äôve got to look good  be talented in their art  find ways to gain popularity and clout  and pretend to be politicians. I wonder why can‚Äôt we leave celebrities to just be good at their art and performances,btohqsg
Like  what's the best strategy to picking a uni degree if you don't already know what you want to do?,btohqsg
I'm probably going to be limited to private uni too  so...,btohqsg
If celebs so choose to take side  so be itI feel celebs should be left to decide if they so choose not to express their sides ‚Äî if they even take sides at al,btohqsg
Not eligible for SUSS PT and didn't do well enough for any of the local autonomous unis,btohqsg
real like no offence but ive seen ppl in kpop online forums admonish kpop idols for not speaking up on social issues. sorry to be harsh but their job is to sing dance and perform not to educate people on whatever is happening in the world rn,btohqsg
Ye. I think it is an unfair demandI think we have no business pressurising celeb to express their views on such matters,btohqsg
More I don't know what I'll be good enough at to do as a job,btohqsg
i mean the article is not true that they do not. most of them do,btohqsg
Eh  sorry I don‚Äôt quite get what you mean. Do you mean that some celebs listed here have been inaccurately listed as showing support?,btohqsg
no the today article says that A-list celebrities are being silent. maybe only small majority of them.,btohqsg
Erm  I don‚Äôt think the article meant there are no A listers that expressed viewsBut those A listers that are silent are being condemned for keeping quietAnd I think that is unfair to those who are silent,btohqsg
That's probably not going to work out well jobs or emigration-wise with a private uni degree especially,btohqsg
yes those who are silent are blocked by both sides,btohqsg
choose which school you prefer of those in Partnership with SIM first,btohqsg
honestly unsure what's the difference between any of them,btohqsg
besides UOL and UOW for CS,btohqsg
which ones are exam-heavy and which ones are more project-heavy?,btohqsg

Keen interest in nurturing students in their learning journey,btohqsg
tbh smth like this you could just ask chatgpt for the pointers and flesh it out on your own,btohqsg
i thought like if you are applying for a program like this you should alr have a rough idea of how to answer those in mind,btohqsg
but yea if rly cannot think then ask chatgpt vomit smth and then u refine lor,btohqsg
qualities and competencies for teaching are subjective  so if you ask chatgpt for what qualities are needed to be a teacher etc you're gonna get a consolidated list of pointers then you see what applies for you and write about it,btohqsg
idk if u wld be surprised but,btohqsg
teachers can v easily see through smoked answers,btohqsg
like for example how i will answer smth like this is that i am calm and adaptable so i can handle unforeseen circumstances in the classroom (eg. Student acting up) + adapt the teaching methods to suit different groups of students with diff learning ability,btohqsg
but ofc this is just a random example that needs to be more fleshed out la,btohqsg
i think when you're presented with a formal question like this  not everyone can just put out a good proper answer just like that,btohqsg
and end of the day the subjective aspect of appealing to the organisation you're applying to matters,btohqsg
since u ask like that  i throw u a question backhow do you think you can add value to the kids under you?,btohqsg
"after a year or two with you  what do you think you have that will make the kid go ""wow i think (s)he was a great teacher and i will miss his/her teaching""",btohqsg
so in a sense you think you can create interesting lessons for your kids?,btohqsg
"ok then maybe to reframe that into a ""quality""",btohqsg
maybe can be smth to do with creativity?,btohqsg
plan lessons that keep students captivated,btohqsg
