ðŸŽ‰Pika World Daily Review â€“ 15 December 2022ðŸŽ‰ðŸ§¸A hawkish Uncle Powell as usualðŸ’£It was clear from the start that there would be no pivot. Without surprise  the Fed increased the target interest rate by 50 basis points and signalled more hikes in 2023. The economy is expected to weaken  and inflation should moderate.Equity markets gave up early gains following the release of the FOMC statement and economic projections but recovered some losses as Uncle Powell began his press conference. The S&P 500 reached an almost breakeven point.The Fed wants to see more progress in economic data before pausing further hikes  and its policy statement was almost the same as the meeting in October. It also signalled interest rates to remain elevated for extended periods to combat sticky inflation.ðŸ“ŠThree types of inflation in playðŸŽ²1) Goods Inflation: It is coming down.2) Shelter and housing Inflation: See signs of slowing with new leases signed.3) Service inflation is driven by wages and is expected to remain high for a considerable time.To combat service inflation  the Fed believes it had to soften the labour market before any victory can be declared.ðŸŽ¢Shifting perspective: the terminal interest rateðŸ”¦Investors will also be closely eyeing the expected federal fund rate for next year with the hope of guessing its peak. Of course  this will be based on incoming economic data such as inflation  employment and economic growth  as suggested by Uncle Powell.As some say  the Fed will tilt towards less prescriptive and shift gear to more reactive to the latest inflation outlook  suggesting that future rate hikes will become more data-dependent.ðŸ“®Whatâ€™s on the menu today?ðŸ“–At 9.30 pm  we will have the Core Retail sales data  which we expect a growth of 0.2%  much slower than the prior 1.3%.The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index will also likely show a decline of -10.0 compared to 19.4 previously.Retail sales data show a drop of 0.1% on a monthly comparison basis.It is 15 December  Thursday  at 9 am in Singapore and 8 pm in New York. It has been an awakening week for traders  and we hope all friends are having a restful break too!,btohqsg
