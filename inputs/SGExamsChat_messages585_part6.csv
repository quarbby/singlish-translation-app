It’s really just marketing and appealing to the audience at this point,btohqsg
now its so easy to express your opinion that you may not stop to think about whether its wrong/biased,btohqsg
dont forget how people exploit misinformation for profit,btohqsg

Most of the retards who do shit like that have nothing better to do that’s why wanna appear cool,btohqsg
i have no answer  i can see both sides,btohqsg
tbh always got people like that but now internet gives them an anonymous platform to spread such takes,btohqsg
No they didn’t really “decide” it  you still have the power to select books you wanna read. Whereas nowadays  one search on Google is enough to determine your entire feed on other apps as well  kinda like giving you too much of what you might be interested in,btohqsg
Of course you can opt out  but most are not likely to since it’s more convenient than a book,btohqsg
"they did though. they would say ""j k rowling not woke enough  all harry potter books banned"". and before internet  that really was the end of your access",btohqsg
Yeah echo chambers are real and are very profitable,btohqsg
