I get the blockchain tech and why coins have value somewhat - they need to reward the miners somehow. But in the end all tie back to fiat  so all those crypto ppl keep say fiat is the end all  to me it's all looney.But NFTs...

üöÄPika World Pulse: Going Defensive now?üöÄüìÆMarket ProgressüèÄIt was yet another fight for gain as the S&P 500 gave up its record high on Tuesday given the continuous global surge in Omicron cases. Covid-19 had infected more than 281 million people since March 2020  and 5.4 million have died.The re-opening play seems to have some life given CDC new recommendation to reduce the isolation period to encourage more people to return to the workforce. It is also a sign that perhaps Covid is becoming more endemic  and there is a better vibe around the sectors moving into New Year.‚è≥Defensive stocks shine againü§ºGiven the higher volatility  defensive stocks have become the radar of most investors. A look at health care and utility ETF have been rising since early November. It is not a surprise given their well-loved nature in times of economic risks.Market participants are jittery with the risks posed by the Fed. Investors shift towards staples  healthcare and utilities is based on the idea that lesser money in the pocket seldom dents the demand for these products and services.‚öñÔ∏èThe bond market speaks the same toneüé¢The bond yield curve has been flattening  implying that economic growth is getting less rosy. In such a situation  defensive stocks tend to shine compared to cyclical stocks.If interest rate hikes and bond yields seem too much to take in a portfolio  a moderate shift to defensive stocks might be a cushion in a challenging environment.The stock market has a less conviction rally  and we remain cautious of downside risk. Pika World wishes everyone an enchanting week aheadCheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
