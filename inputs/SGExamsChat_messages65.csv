Some joker try to change some stuff,btohqsg
Wont fall into this kind of issue one,btohqsg
That was for practical exam though,btohqsg
Doesnt matter hahaha u learn earlier u have time to practice and revise,btohqsg
U wont come to a situation where u have to rely on others,btohqsg
U try see some pe qns,btohqsg
Thats why whatever i can settle now i wanna settle hahaha,btohqsg
Ofc there are things not in ur control lah,btohqsg
Thats y must have buffer time nia,btohqsg
Idk ah thats what i think and have been doing for certain things,btohqsg
If you kena caught in the future tho  I remember a case that somebody kena caught ghost writing few years after graduation  degree revoked.,btohqsg
Have u finished the qns i sent you?,btohqsg
Havnt yet today physics day hahah,btohqsg
Then tmr change to maths day hahaha prohramming tuesday then,btohqsg
Even better time to study biochemistry,btohqsg
I see ppl posting on stackexchange before,btohqsg
Logic statement obv is the same but format/ classes/variables/sets all,btohqsg
But there can be many ways to solve a problem,btohqsg
It is quite obvious if u copy,btohqsg
Unless those v easy ones where there is only 1 way,btohqsg
Especially if its in the middle of no where,btohqsg
But ur course easier to go into r&d,btohqsg
Bme quite alot go further studies also,btohqsg
don't know other research institutes other than A*,btohqsg
Thry go further studies also in the end unemployed,btohqsg
Go overseas do phd then become a prof,btohqsg
This kind of course unless ure exceptional theres really no point hahah,btohqsg
It only exists for ppl to become prof,btohqsg
if u wanna pursue academia/higher studies,btohqsg
You study phd in local uni most likely also cant get assistant prof position,btohqsg
They mostly get lecturer position thats all,btohqsg
Ya is can but v rare,btohqsg
will probably have to consult my uni profs,btohqsg
Most dont get tenure track for sure,btohqsg
As tough as the current circuit breaker measures,btohqsg
You’re going to be a professor?,btohqsg
Where u planning to do ur phd?,btohqsg
but idk if I can even make the cut,btohqsg
definitely a respectable and 'noble' calling,btohqsg
have been wanting to pursue it for q some time,btohqsg
idm being a normal researcher la,btohqsg
ok nobody asked im gna leave,btohqsg
Why pharm when you can farm,btohqsg
cya at the counter at guardian's,btohqsg
She will never graduate from JC,btohqsg
Maybe during BME ill create smth pertaining farming for disabled,btohqsg
oh see you in pharm then!,btohqsg
most ppl legit work at the counters of pharmacies/polyclinics,btohqsg
Not sure about that though idh friends in pharm,btohqsg
i know select few go into research,btohqsg
ehhh but 83.75 can go in alr,btohqsg
if it doesnt drop i will be shocked tbh,btohqsg
but I couldn't get into pharm sci,btohqsg
The prospects for pharm may not be v promising tbh,btohqsg
yea i wna do pharm sci,btohqsg
so hence inflation in cut off requirements,btohqsg
Do u plan to do research?,btohqsg
ppl who usually go pharm sci don't do teaching,btohqsg
also quite hard to go teachin,btohqsg
Great cause that is quite a common path,btohqsg
MOE prefers a hard science degree,btohqsg
so aka ur physics/maths/chem/life science degree,btohqsg
but sometimes you can't get straight As,btohqsg
I can never get straight As,btohqsg
but yes unless u are a scholar going into pharmacy  u are quite gg for prospects,btohqsg
yeap ! >:3 ill try mh best,btohqsg
I think there is serious oversaturation in pharm now,btohqsg
It has become super oversaturated for pharm,btohqsg
I wanna be like jay master of all trades but proficient in none,btohqsg
First time hear you say yourself dumb sia,btohqsg
they are revamping the curriculum now la,btohqsg
i everyday wake up tell myself i stupid leh,btohqsg
cos at the end of the day  its a specialised degree,btohqsg
theres only so much u can do,btohqsg
When i was teaching tuition i met a pharm grad,btohqsg
cos then i will work harder cos im stupid,btohqsg
It is not v promising atm,btohqsg
no but im actly stupid tho,btohqsg
if promising in terms of high pay ofc not,btohqsg
thats why i need to work harder than a normal person :”),btohqsg
otherwise if u have a passion to serve ppl in healthcare  I guess pharmacy works,btohqsg
Why imposter when u can pygmalion syndrome,btohqsg
Maybe I should consider maths researcher too,btohqsg
it's either you go hospital or you go research,btohqsg
if i can go hosp itll b great,btohqsg
U can be the next chin chee whye in nus,btohqsg
My H3 Maths lecturer was telling us about how the maths dept received a maths problem and the whole dept was working on it together,btohqsg
which course are you in rn,btohqsg
same same too :D  but for another subject,btohqsg
Imagine being paid to solve puzzles,btohqsg
which course are you in btww,btohqsg
U know what is small 3,btohqsg
but planning to transfer to dapc,btohqsg
perfumery can go into pharm one,btohqsg
Its a majority girls course thi,btohqsg
I heard that course only has 1 perfumery module,btohqsg
Sugars are always interesting and complex,btohqsg
its mostly organic chem based !,btohqsg
Organic chem is like the best part of chem,btohqsg
mine is the 21st letter of the alphabet,btohqsg
Are u active in the RC zone 4 grp,btohqsg
I seen kai in there lol,btohqsg
Do you wanna be a boomer?,btohqsg
He’s just so excited to see u you know,btohqsg
We go drink each a cup,btohqsg
cos my class time q odd leh,btohqsg
I reach sch abt that time,btohqsg
and i will have my first mid sem tests,btohqsg
yea i start at 8am too,btohqsg
thats only for tuesdays tho !,btohqsg
Ive nvr been so happy to go back camp tbh,btohqsg
Uni is like half of that,btohqsg
no i have a 6h long lect + prac,btohqsg
I rmb ite i got one sem friday no class,btohqsg
i start w prac then break then lect   prac and lect again,btohqsg
Most of ur time spent in the labs then,btohqsg
Like v common for u to run ur experiments,btohqsg
perfumery only kicks in end y2,btohqsg
Then come back for ur result,btohqsg
Thats what my chem major friends experience,btohqsg
acid & bases or titrations first  ,btohqsg
Tbh i have no idea how to be boomer except good am pm and gobbles@boomer1969,btohqsg
but acid & bases are basically almst titrations LOL,btohqsg
the onw thing i practised so hard for o’s,btohqsg
My JC didn’t have tap for the burettes,btohqsg
my o’s the only year that didnt have,btohqsg
Lai wo jiao ni zen yang zuo boomer. First must telk liddis w  second punctuations dun matter! 1!1!1!11!1! Third must say STINKAGPOREAN VOTE PAP OR KENNA SOCIAL BLAKLIST ez,btohqsg
but we’re gonna use an auto-tirtator so,btohqsg
Can we take it into PM LOL,btohqsg
I blame clip for me bumbling up titration in A Levels,btohqsg
Their labs are even nicer than uni lans,btohqsg
Uni labs are also quite crappy,btohqsg
Oo the auto titrator was only an intro,btohqsg
but i may not even get to use one,btohqsg
I went to NUS's lab to learn about UV spec,btohqsg
Has pen and paper and everything,btohqsg
i only went to nus auditorium once,btohqsg
and it was for a competition,btohqsg
idr knw what i was doing HAHA,btohqsg
I went for a history challenge instead,btohqsg
they gave me an empty map of punggol and told me to plan it,btohqsg
that was the team based one,btohqsg
but my team didnt know what to do,btohqsg
nope ! cos for the semi finals i came back late and got points deducted,btohqsg
we got lost at nus campus,btohqsg
we had to go arnd sg to complete geog challenges,btohqsg
I got lost in NTU once in no.4,btohqsg
each station had a booklet of questions,btohqsg
i rmb one was specifically on mixed developmental buildings,btohqsg
The halls area look like some forest,btohqsg
If he knew where he was he wouldn’t be lost,btohqsg
Well hall area is quite easy to recognise,btohqsg
it was about buildings having more than one use la,btohqsg
and implications on enbloc of golden mile building,btohqsg
one booklet was about water treatment and parks i think,btohqsg
we had to do 3 around sg,btohqsg
then go back to nus campus,btohqsg
but my team and i got lost cos we went to the wrg part of campus,btohqsg
my sense of direction is bad to the point i get lost in a box :),btohqsg
Fass building not v nice horh,btohqsg
I’ve only been to the blue grey building that is the maths department,btohqsg
nus buildings look q run down tbh,btohqsg
its okok only looks q sad tbh,btohqsg
But it’s a few bus stops from Kent ridge,btohqsg
The blue building is the new one bah,btohqsg
except for the fking medicine building,btohqsg
None of my classmates could tell it was new,btohqsg
Biz building quite nice also arh,btohqsg
But the inside is pretty nice,btohqsg
but i cnt go in also,btohqsg
you could tell how they allocated their resources,btohqsg
Speaking of NUS is making me miss H3 lectures,btohqsg
Sci building is certainly 1 of the oldest,btohqsg
too dumb to step thru their doors,btohqsg
Are they still holding smo anyway,btohqsg
I went to NTU food science lab,btohqsg
well i mean i destroyed my chances alr by gg poly & into perfumery :”),btohqsg
Ntu spms labs are v buce,btohqsg
just because you're in poly doesn't mean you don't have a chance to go med,btohqsg
but usually it's those biomed kids la,btohqsg
yea but im in perfumery i cant even apply LOL,btohqsg
So idk how is it now,btohqsg
How many from biomed get into medicine anyway,btohqsg
biomed won’t accept me keke :”,btohqsg
Nus labs are the one that needs to be renovated,btohqsg
aiya it's okay you're going pharm anyway,btohqsg
They will appear in the news,btohqsg
U can be one of them,btohqsg
Biomed ones are dependant on their internship,btohqsg
im not even in biomed BAHHAHA,btohqsg
shouldn't there be oversaturation of doctors >:(,btohqsg
Unless ur gpa is like perfect and got portfolio,btohqsg
Last time only nus med still possible,btohqsg
Unlike doctors who go start up their own gp,btohqsg
Yah only got a few guardians,btohqsg
After they serve enough years in hospitals,btohqsg
cant even be one of the 280,btohqsg
Although its prospects is not super bright,btohqsg
Is there any degree that’s not tough,btohqsg
Does it require u to learn chem bio maths physics lab programming ?,btohqsg
If u compare workload and number of hours spent in sch,btohqsg
There are slack degrees for sure,btohqsg
U go nus comp bio cohort size only 19 ppl,btohqsg
Some fass courses and biz lorh,btohqsg
What does this question even mean,btohqsg
Its okay its stupid enuf to not warrant a reply hahaha,btohqsg
B L A S P H E M Y,btohqsg
Maths is science in the sense that people study and discover things about it,btohqsg
Maths is art in the sense that it’s all made up,btohqsg
and is still applicable in today's world,btohqsg
“The unreasonable effectiveness of applying maths to reality”,btohqsg
no wonder hard to get A,btohqsg
my year my course only 40+ people,btohqsg
cause we got this special module,btohqsg
got infected with big normie vibes,btohqsg
"Someone should add a ""back to discord degen"" sticker into the sgexams sticker pack",btohqsg
Then overtime become single digit cos drop out,btohqsg
I heard got 1 yr only 1 person grad,btohqsg
So in the end year 3/4,btohqsg
Cos the other 49 drop out,btohqsg
But my friend said he year 1 around 15 ppl only,btohqsg
Requirements quite lax to get in right,btohqsg
Qf probably harder to get in,btohqsg
Keeping the degens in their pen,btohqsg
Is Comp bio rly that hard,btohqsg
Because u need to be good at everything,btohqsg
U do bio mods chem mods math computing everything,btohqsg
I expect molecular dynamics  since you need to care about exactly how proteins (aka fk ton of amino acids fold),btohqsg
In short  you just need physics,btohqsg
Pls don't say that b word,btohqsg
I was thinking of Comp bio but my Friend said that computing would actually be more relevant,btohqsg
Unless u are really interested in both,btohqsg
Comp bio jobs are mostly research based,btohqsg
Bruh u add a few eng and phy mods it becomes bme,btohqsg
Would I need to do further studies tho,btohqsg
U all do computing mods meh,btohqsg
Comp bio does quite alot leh,btohqsg
You know my job is like c0ding daily so I don't see the appeal,btohqsg
Cuz I learnt a bit of bio informatics,btohqsg
You either handle SEGFAULT or HTTP 502,btohqsg
But that 1 mod determines ur fyp,btohqsg
Lol so u better learn it well,btohqsg
Never posted yet in this group but honestly yall should watch this,btohqsg
That modules in uni are usually more boring,btohqsg
Oi not my fault my bacground is PB not OOP,btohqsg
In fact I highly recommend this youtuber's videos derp,btohqsg
I’m not dead set on computing tho,btohqsg
Btw  this is how all Product Managers to computiong people look like,btohqsg
What else have you got in mind,btohqsg
why are all the hackerman in movies so good looking,btohqsg
If not good looking cannot fit into the spamming RGB,btohqsg
I’ve cracked the mainframe server to the HTML drive,btohqsg
I’m just typing on the keyboard,btohqsg
I am calculating probability of successful entry,btohqsg
Let me help you calibrate your exponential calculus model to help you computate all the possible quantum spin values of the state,btohqsg
Research doesn't mean you have to be prof mah,btohqsg
;_; RND in company is not any easier to get than a prof positino,btohqsg
What’s the difference between uni research and R&D at a company anyway,btohqsg
I mean like yes Tenure is haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaard to get but Corp Research positions aren't that many as well,btohqsg
Are you recruiting for your future tuition empire,btohqsg
Tho TBH actually not really these days. MIT does a lot of its research with industrial AKA $ focus.,btohqsg
And the companies pay them for it?,btohqsg
I mean  you want to pay some rando in NUS or you want to get the TOP PROVEN UNIVERSITY WITH MANY CONTRACTS TO DOD AND DOE AND ABLE TO GATHER MANY SKILLED GRADUATE STUDENTS TO DO THE WORK,btohqsg
I wont do such scummy stuff,btohqsg
wa don't usurp sgexams so early,btohqsg
You have passed the loyalty test. You have been awarded Class 1 Security Clearance.,btohqsg
Icey u took h3 bio right,btohqsg
This is starting to sound like Load Balancers,btohqsg
It’s Chem in case you were serious,btohqsg
Oh who was the h3 bio fella,btohqsg
I do recall someone talking about H3 bio,btohqsg
Eh u familiar w the moe h3 bio course right,btohqsg
If ure talking about mw he takes h3 molecular which is diff,btohqsg
Hahaha i wanted to know if h3 moe bio teaches about bioelectricity,btohqsg
You don’t even take O Levels Bio,btohqsg
Sls has h3 moe bio ?,btohqsg
U can still login to SLS?,btohqsg
No i wanted to find jay tan calling me rusty,btohqsg
Wait but i got SLS in J1,btohqsg
Means you should have gotten SLS in J2,btohqsg
Ill pass i have other plans,btohqsg
I have a 17% chance of losing,btohqsg
I can't even remember where I got my lecture recordings from,btohqsg
Maybe I had sls but I don't remember,btohqsg
I dont know what this is,btohqsg
Online portal for schools to upload materials,btohqsg
