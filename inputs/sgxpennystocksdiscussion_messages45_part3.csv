TG no need worry la... has been dancing on day cloud. on big wave3,btohqsg
MT want to trap ppl again,btohqsg
Actually no retailers - no one help them push the price up also,btohqsg
It‚Äôs like range bound - cause no retailers help them push. üòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
ya dont buy. stay out. let it die down.,btohqsg
Those are young prop employed by cimb etc,btohqsg

It‚Äôll be a while before MT before,btohqsg
I think before Q3 will shoot up to previous high,btohqsg
If not retailers also won‚Äôt go in,btohqsg
üëçWhen MT rose to 1.98  motive gained. Now they play ranging gm  occasionally up to 1.3 to create false hope to attract more investors. Then down to ranging gm again. They HUAT  we stuck.,btohqsg
VP till now still haven‚Äôt fall below 0.3. Seems BBs also stuck and play the ranging gm till recover enuf first. üòõ,btohqsg
Stuck at MT   better than stuck at SingTel or SPH. My personal opinion.,btohqsg
I stopped to roll over any more. BB trick us with false break up then after 1-2bip reverse or worse px go down trapping so many contra Traders. So I out completely for now till things settle down. All be careful. No point risking. Let the BB n Traders eat each other. ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
If good price  buy n pick up for later price up. No contra n margin.,btohqsg
What happen to smm? Why down?,btohqsg
Ya! Still holding a@ 250. Sian man!!,btohqsg
get out still not too painful,btohqsg
If have Avarga  don‚Äôt sell so low. When next report cmin out  should reach 0.26 min. üòÅ,btohqsg
what u expecting in next result to trigger the rise to 26,btohqsg
Good results plus good dividend. üòÅ,btohqsg
Nowadays market no play how.good.result cant.move too far,btohqsg
from who and where? taiga contribution ah the lumber story,btohqsg
I reckon the good result expectation oreli factored in since the last run up. I was too late to catch it. Sgh!!,btohqsg
Oh  then I‚Äôm wrong. Soli soli,btohqsg
