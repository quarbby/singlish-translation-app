I think once BBs push above the pressure lines  then maybe game on. See this group of Chinese BBs bah. OSOD . Dyodd.,btohqsg
Dough stick 9 dollars .. wahaha . Hawker dough stick fresh make only 80 cent to 1 dollars,btohqsg

The current group of BBs really quite incredible  they are going for the over 100% type of pumps.Just check these 3 counters out- China Mining (3000% in 4 days)- ChinaKundaTech (360% in 3 days)- Jadason (146% in a single day)Judging from the looks of it  currently  these BBs are aiming those of the below 👇 characteristics- Chinese related / linked company  directly or indirectly- Illiquid- ‘light’We should be expecting spillover plays to the rest of the pennies. This is the hottest we have seen our market in maybe the past 2-3 years.Nevertheless  play responsibly and safely and react accordingly. Once the music stops  and if still caught  might be freezer for life for some.Hence  always remind oneself on the importance of being disciplined especially on SL.,btohqsg
Incredible isn’t it . Our market become casino 🎰,btohqsg
Anyways  careful and I think good stick to FIFO   hit and run IMO .Also  I see many over here talking or calling stocks. Always Dyodd and if anyone decide to follow anyone here  always remember that its your own decision and it’s your own responsibility  whenever you decide to hit the triggerHence  make your own decision and react as you will deem it to fit your own risk profile.,btohqsg

3 Temasek Linked Tech Musketeers on 5th Sep (Thu):1)After 13.4% up to close at $1.1 on Wed  17live went up another 6.4% today to close at $1.17. Seem like 17live might be cornered. Let's see how it goes over next few session for confirmation.2) Nanofilm has slightly dropped back fr 78.5c on Tue to 78c today. Ground still looks firm and we may see it advance if it can break out fr resistance band 79-82c and closer to Apple's launch of iPhone 16. I think it would cheong if sale is strong.3) AEM is the weakest amongst the three by dropping back 6.6% from $1.36 to close at $1.27 today. Just watching for now as it looks shaky to me.DYODD yah,btohqsg
Since Grand Banks released its fantastic result on 29 Aug  price has gone up from about 40c to 48c today over last 1 week. It looks like it is about to break out from 48 - 50c resistance band today before flying off. Getting my fund ready for this. DYODD.,btohqsg
Seatrium keeps dancing cha cha but overall direction seems to be up. I'm adding bit by bit on dip and look forward it to clear recent peak at $1.73.,btohqsg

Market now hot   need to remind everyone too  not to blindly hoot.Also  many people talk different counters . Here open sharing .But  if any one decides to blindly follow or hoot  also be prepared to blindly lose or win.Last thing want to see is people unnecessarily burnt or blaming.So everyone  OSOD  DYODD. Anyone here blaming or complaining will be removed. Heads up first. I don’t like those who greedy want to huat. But want to blame if lose . Must take responsibility.,btohqsg
