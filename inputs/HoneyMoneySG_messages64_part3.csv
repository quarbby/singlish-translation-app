Got datapoint earlier that you may not get 4mpd from CRMC if buying from Apple Store.,btohqsg
Hi guys  may I clarify for CRMC‚Äôs singsaver spend criteria for new-to-bank signup bonus (Spend 500SGD for one of the rewards)1. Can the 500SGD be on an MCC that doesn‚Äôt earn 10x points? eg Travel MCC spend?2. What rate do I get on CRMC for a Travel transaction? Is it 0.4mpd or 0mpd?3. Can buying NTUC vouchers physically at NTUC outlet with instarem amaze + CRMC get both the 10x points and also fulfill the signup bonus spend criteria?4. Not related to signup bonus  assuming I spend 1k on Travel MCC then a day later I spend 1k on an MCC that gets 10x points  do I still get the maximum monthly rewards? (4k miles),btohqsg
