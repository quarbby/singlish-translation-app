it awkward for a guy to say it,btohqsg
OMG GUYS I FUCKED UP I NEVER GO TOILET BEFORE PAPER SO I HAD TO PISS SUPER BADLY DURING THE ENTIRE PPR. END UP I HAD TO RUN TO THE TOILET BUT I PISSED MYSELF  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HALL. IT WAS SO EMBARRASING I COULDN'T EVEN FINISH HALF THE PAPER BECAUSE I HAD TO CHANGE ALL MY SHIT. ❤️❤️❤️ YOU ARE WELCOME FOR THE BELLCURVE BOOST,btohqsg
this will be how the story will look like,btohqsg
I DAMN TEMPTED TO SEND SOME WEIRD SHIT NOW,btohqsg
Its only awkward if you make it awkward and don’t you study biology from your crush?,btohqsg
I mean it awkward of what,btohqsg
Okay  but in all seriousness  I don’t think that uncontrollable bladder incontinence is something to tease others about.,btohqsg
I need you to rephrase please.,btohqsg
touch somewhere. and discovered in her skirt.,btohqsg
and she just sat down during the whole duration of the paper,btohqsg
she did not went to the toilet I think,btohqsg
then she had to try and wipe it with the scrap paper they give,btohqsg
How do you even know that,btohqsg
Um. Why not just go change?,btohqsg
the comments of the emath p2 rigjt,btohqsg
the person's account is gone now for some reason,btohqsg
Why would she share it then,btohqsg
got to do what you can for that reddit karma,btohqsg
Thank you for revealing to us that private fact of your crush,btohqsg
seeing the success of the throwaway account now everybody want to follow their steps,btohqsg
We usually do? Like  I still don’t get why she’d sit there and just watch it drip.,btohqsg
BOD maybe cuz she didn’t wanna waste time,btohqsg
Either she doesn’t keep track or hers is seriously irregular,btohqsg
I know period is actually really unexpected,btohqsg
That’s why we use the theory of in omnia paratus?,btohqsg
I send her about the girl having her period during P2.,btohqsg
And chose to instead waste time trying to cover it up and squirming in discomfort,btohqsg
OK can we change the topic,btohqsg
good price and food not bad,btohqsg
don’t go in expecting a lot,btohqsg
yeah i think the price is fair for the food,btohqsg
lie 590 for a decent plate of carbonara,btohqsg
i was very surprised when i first saw the prices ngl,btohqsg
but ye their value is good,btohqsg
"at that time i assume all the ""western"" places are very atas and must have at least $7+ for their meals",btohqsg
i used to think carbonara was made with cream,btohqsg
I only like the legit kind,btohqsg
only last year i found out it's with egg yolk,btohqsg
once i saw someone try to make carbonara,btohqsg
i haven't actually tried pesto b4 but a particular foodtuber always sings high praises for it so,btohqsg
basically you grind basil leaf  pine nuts and basil together,btohqsg
bruh they even got the sage leaf on top,btohqsg
at least i'm assuming it's sage,btohqsg
It was an Italian place in I think Switzerland,btohqsg
Italian restaurants in Europe is as common as like cai fan here lol,btohqsg
i nvr go out of asia before,btohqsg
and their pizza prices are insane,btohqsg
"is there an european version of ""这个"" and ""那个""",btohqsg
I rmb in Switzerland their supermarket chain coop sometimes got food inside,btohqsg
