I'm PES F. They gave me bacuse I'm high functioning autism.They didn't care that I was gay or clinically depressed. They looked at my diagonsis of autism and said I'm either Pes E or F. If I could produce evidence of work ethic (Internship no problem)  then I'll be pes E.But they gave me F after discussing with parents and 6 months deferment.,btohqsg
Oof hard to say. Honestly I don't really have one?I'm very grateful to have supportive friends who've done everything they can to help and be there. I can just be myself around them. Raw and unfiltered. It's amazing.,btohqsg
And people seem annoyed by it,btohqsg
Find people who don't care/mind/accepts you.People who get annoyed are the people who self-filter out of your life.,btohqsg
People tend to judge rather than clarify nowadays...,btohqsg
Yes  it's a trending video indeed.,btohqsg

hi! qns regarding eae: wld it be okay to write about achievements in pri sch?is preparing the portfolio important before submitting write-up?is it possible to write 1000-char or 600-char in point form?,btohqsg
Can you write in point form,btohqsg
i can't rmb the eae process on the website but is it compulsory to submit portfolio asap,btohqsg
oh man.....idh any official certs from sec sch aside from cca achievements ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
You can write in point form* sorry I slight drunk rn AHAH,btohqsg
Portfolio only needed when u go for interview -,btohqsg
Just put all your certs you have :),btohqsg
Idt portfolio is compulsory  thing is most people have some form of portfolio so have to fight the competition,btohqsg
It depends on the school... If you're selected for the interview  they'll give an email what to prepare... So if the email do not state anything about portfolio then u don't need it.,btohqsg
hi guys! for the testimonial to put in for the EAE portfolio given by the teacher(s) right  is there like a specific template for them to fllw and write?,btohqsg
hi everybody  i went into my current diploma course through eae last yearâ€¦ (went through all the stages: writeup  aptitude  interview) for anyone needing help for their eae writeup and needs a template etc etc. you can ask any questions.,btohqsg
so for testimonials  my teacher just wrote for me and just talked about the qualities in which i possess. however  alot of my teachers also told me how that testimonials dont buy leverage for EAE applicants :(,btohqsg
Hmm my teacher didn't ask for template leh,btohqsg
It's a recommendation letter  quite common lah,btohqsg
yes  testimonials aren't that important from what ive heard by the year 1s this year  but it still doesn't hurt to have ah,btohqsg
Tip for EAE and any of such applications in general  just remember that there are 1000 other people just like you trying to get in. You just need to find the ammo/stuff that will help you stand out. Testimonials help a bit  but you realize anyone can write a testimonial too. Portfolio helps  but if all you have are certs  many people have that too.,btohqsg
hi for the EAE process whats the time frame that I can get offers from the different polys?,btohqsg
It depends on the value the testimonial brings to the student.Every student these days will have a teacherâ€™s testimonial  but how many would have an industry leaderâ€™s testimonial?,btohqsg
Like what they said  what do you have that makes you stand out?,btohqsg
Anyone here has EAE to business course successfully before can PM :),btohqsg
Hello! Iâ€™ve EAEâ€™ed into NPâ€™s Business Studies :),btohqsg

So  unlikely to be call for interview from 3 Diploma courses?,btohqsg
Hi any pure geog students here? what sort of essay qns will they give for food resources up to G2,btohqsg
It depends how well ur write up is,btohqsg

hi! for testimonials for eae  must they be written by a teacher?i'm currently applying as a private candidate (if i'm not wrong  that's possible  right?) and i'm not in contact with my teachers,btohqsg
And testimonials all only show during interview & not important during your write up,btohqsg
Is dengue still part of alevel h2 bio syllabus? Just want to double confirm  my friend said no longer in syllabus.,btohqsg
Not necessarily! It can be by a relevant professional in the industry too! Perhaps your outside CCA coach. Member of the management from the place you frequently volunteer at _etc_,btohqsg
It shldnt be anymore. For viruses  you only need to know HIV and Influenza,btohqsg
It can still be technically tested as an application question,btohqsg
