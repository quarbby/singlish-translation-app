Wish it had no cap üòÇ,btohqsg
What card to use for big ticket housing items?,btohqsg
Me too man. The card is really easy to use.,btohqsg
hey guys quick question!if i use CRMC to pay say UOB Lady's CC bill  i do get the 1% cashback for the next statement month when CRMC bill is paid via EGA  is that correct?im still waiting for UOB to respond on the interbank GIRO applicationsame concept applies to using other CCs that have bill payment done via EGA GIRO  used to pay for other CC bills?EDIT: for future readers  we cannot use a credit cardCC to pay the bill of another CC,btohqsg
Can you buy them online? If you can  Citi SMRT is good for $12k per membership year cap and gives 5% cash back.You can also buy HeyMax vouchers which code as MCC5311 departmental store and use the vouchers physically. A lot of cards gives rewards on 5311 and HeyMax gives you the chance to split the purchase into many cards.,btohqsg
Cannot pay CC bill using another CC,btohqsg
Sad I need to buck up.,btohqsg
Btw  it is based on transaction date actually  unlike other HSBC cards. Same method as HSBC Visa Platinum and HSBC Premier (when it was a cashback card) used to calculate the cashback.,btohqsg
Oh yes I totally forgot about that üòÇ thanks Oscar!,btohqsg
For welcome rewards that require min spend + annual fee (UOB prvi) what happens if I make the min spend but 2 months later I get a refund for one of the transactions?,btohqsg
U need to make up the spend and try appeal if they claw back,btohqsg
But the time period was already over and I‚Äôve paid for that statement alr,btohqsg
U can read tnc  there is clause on subsequent refund tnc,btohqsg
Mine only 100+ but because of this.. I can provide verification that it is calculated based on posted date. Instead of the transaction date that the cso told me.,btohqsg
If this information is impt to anyone of you..cos I wanna know how much balance to keep for the last month of the quarter..,btohqsg
Each voucher will have a certain value. Just use different cards to purchase the vouchers,btohqsg
Are you sure that you don‚Äôt have non-eligible spendings? Cause transaction date perfectly works with my calculations.,btohqsg
My calculation is exact. I have 3 transactions on 30 sep that are only posted on 2 oct and those do not count to this rebate..,btohqsg
Yours got posting different quarter like mine?,btohqsg
Oh u maxed out. Wow.. so how did you know it's transaction date then? Yours is exact?,btohqsg
I keep tracking and spend exactly or close to it.Also I link it to heymax and check MCC to make sure it is eligible spending.,btohqsg
Hmmm I track in excel and also check in heymax.. but my way to finally determine is the last 3 transactions (which will get me about $8 cashback) made on 30 sep and only posted on 2 oct..,btohqsg
for hsbc revo  if opt for instalment payment for apple products  will it still earn bonus?,btohqsg
Hello! I‚Äôm currently in JB and found out my Instarem amaze card can‚Äôt tap at the petrol station pump. Need to finish pumping then go in to pay via counterAnyone experienced before?No issues with my revolut in the past. Is there a setting I need to do?,btohqsg
Base on my experience  foreign debit cards not accepted  if must go to counter and pay for petrol before pumping.,btohqsg
Hey guys  is the principal sum of 20k guaranteed in choc finance or still subject to market fluctuations,btohqsg
Tried before at 2 different petrol stations. Told the attendant that I am intending to pay with a card and attendant then starts filling up and said to go to counter for payment after it was done.,btohqsg
Yea that‚Äôs my current experience. With revolut I can just tap at the pump and start pumping straight,btohqsg
For people using eight telco  how long is the porting process? I have a trip next friday so not sure can finish by then.Right now they have promo first month credit is free I think üòÅ.,btohqsg
1-2 dayseSIM is fasterPhysical SIM need to receive it before porting starts,btohqsg
Boss  you are using eight too? üòú,btohqsg
Same day for me very fast. I collected physical SIM card 8pm. By 12mn already port over,btohqsg
Eunos collection outlet is better.Tampines collection outlet very arrogant,btohqsg
After receiving physical sim card in around 3-5 working days and then activating it  the porting over process took slightly more than 1 day and the promo credit gets credited very quickly after you activate the physical sim card.,btohqsg
Ah I see. Is this for delivery?,btohqsg
correct  if you opt for physical sim card to be delivered to you,btohqsg
Ok thanks all. Ill prob opt for self pickup. üëçüëç,btohqsg
Guys any new promotion best deal for home boardband if any thanks,btohqsg
If you need home line   I think m1 so for the best,btohqsg
6 Gpbs plan think More worth it as you got the Tp link be850 router,btohqsg
If no need home line just buy data card and use sim card online??,btohqsg
I ported from circles to eight within 1 week. During the $0 88 day promo period.,btohqsg
Amazing didnt know that. It seems I don't see a per day plan at all,btohqsg
Then I'll do it after my trip to be safe.,btohqsg
I didn't like the idea all the wifi home line need 24 months contract. Well if I just use a data card maybe sufficient... a 8 dollar per month on eight gives 288gb  so I just need to figure out how to link the sim to the notebook,btohqsg
Ah maybe I just need to buy a e-sim wifi router at home,btohqsg
In theory ya. But don't think any lte/sim wifi router has good coverage for home env  like going through walls/etc.,btohqsg
Using eight mobile at taipei now   good connection,btohqsg
How's your experience with eight? The 18 per month 558gb looks good to me!,btohqsg
Woo good news. Do u use a mobile router?,btohqsg
