Now I know . But the amount get back at the end of the 10 yrs will be little . Might as well sell on the 5th years or when the coe is high to get some profit,btohqsg
some ppl just use it point to point  drive all the way,btohqsg
As a business man   profit comes before anything,btohqsg
that's why im living my life pathetically,btohqsg
Hahaha not profit  but rather is reducing losses,btohqsg
When you have 5 boys like me   money is really not enough .,btohqsg
Hahaha dun mind my saying  as a businessman especially in sg buying car you should know the mathematics üòÇ,btohqsg
Now my wife is pregrant with another 3   I need to make more milk money,btohqsg

My wife got allocated funds for the kids . She mentions that   property price will be very high by the time they grow up and not sure what f they can afford any .,btohqsg
That is a problem that WE the current flat owners need to fix,btohqsg
But we give them life to come to this world   so need to provide them with some support .,btohqsg
But yes i have heard alot ppl saying now housing so expensive  by the time kids get housing  norm is 1million le,btohqsg
Maybe become like Japan or HKG   cannot afford the property,btohqsg
support until they start working can liao  how long you wanna spoon feed them  though,btohqsg
this day and age spend your money make yourself happy can liao  life too short to worry about the next generation,btohqsg
I mention some support not full support,btohqsg
But we must not become like China where the parents must settle their kid's housing problem,btohqsg

Last 2 rounds haven get car  down Liao,btohqsg
Will COE drop to 35k-40k ?,btohqsg
now everyone know coe drop everyone will rush to buy,btohqsg
Hi car is 2 years old around 15k. Workshop say battery charge at 80% say recommend to change. Need to change?Then tyre rotation and wheel balancing suppose to do but they say my rim not straight then need to change rim then can do balance and rotation. Should I also?,btohqsg
But all are chargeable except labour,btohqsg
They can just factor labour in,btohqsg
Ya so should change or can ignore?,btohqsg
Huh? Warranty is 5yrs or up to 10k km  whichever first ah?,btohqsg
Sounds fishy to me. Your car 2 yrs old only  15k km  rim can drive till not straight ah?,btohqsg
Rim I think they say change 4 is 400?,btohqsg
I think I mount strike curb sometime. But is it so severe to make it no straight?,btohqsg
Huh  what battery they use? Usually is about 80 to 120  battery very easy to change,btohqsg
Yah possible but unless you buang daily  else is kerb rash only. Suggest you check with another workshop,btohqsg
So fast need to flush brake fluid?,btohqsg
Engine better dun flush  especially since your engine would have a coating of the protective oil,btohqsg
I more surprised 10k already engine flush  brake flush also hahaha,btohqsg
Can request all don‚Äôt change except engine oil n filter?,btohqsg
No cause it‚Äôs either you hit 6 months or the mileage interval. Because I drive very little  the mileage only 15k. But I hit my every other 6 months interval and this is where I am at currently,btohqsg
Can but will void warranty cause I didn‚Äôt adhere to the 6 months servicing cycle,btohqsg
Service don‚Äôt need flush one. That should be optional one.Oil and gearbox oil change is a service,btohqsg
You can take out the car manual. It will tell you maintenance is oil changes. Never seen the manual say flush.,btohqsg
But ya. Seems like you hostage to your workshop quite bad. Worst than C&C ü§£,btohqsg
The manual is in Japanese cause it‚Äôs a PI,btohqsg
