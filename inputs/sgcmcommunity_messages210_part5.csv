Can the world standardise all cars to be lhd or rhd?,btohqsg
not gonna happen in our lifetime.. lol,btohqsg
I agree. Stay as it is. It’s troublesome to force everyone to one side by rule of law,btohqsg
it'll be good  but it's a pipe dream,btohqsg
The pros will overweight the cons in long term,btohqsg
Big risk  if SG becomes a LHD country like Indonesia and the Anericas. Malaysia and Thailand has to follow,btohqsg
i agree  but realistically  which country would want to spend so much money to change their whole road system?,btohqsg

Or standardised all sit middle :),btohqsg
