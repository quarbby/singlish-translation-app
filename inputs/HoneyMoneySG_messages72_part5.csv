Thanks but if i am using iphone how to tap google pay on the card machine at ntuc?,btohqsg
Use Apple Pay. I thought u Android user since u mentioned Google Pay.,btohqsg
But apple pay cannot support Ezlink wallet mastercard right?,btohqsg
I android user. Else scan SG QR with Ezlink logo.,btohqsg
Ok thanks. I see whether got this logo later at ntuc,btohqsg
SG QR I seen at hawker  markets and some shops  NTUC maybe don't have.,btohqsg
For UOB One account:Let's say I1. have 100k deposited2. Deposit my salary3. Spend above min on credit card4. Max out EIR and CC cash back...Where would a good be too hold new funds/channel new funds?1. OCBC 365?2. UOB Stash?3. Others?Thanks in advance for ideas,btohqsg
Anyone know why do I not see the RSP option in WeBull?,btohqsg
Use atome installment can get cash back for Evo or revolution card ?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm in same situation‚Ä¶ plan to channel extra funds to OCBC using the ‚ÄúSalary‚Äù heck,btohqsg
No ‚ÄúSalary‚Äù heck for OCBC 360,btohqsg
Yeah I read about the heck too but I didn't think it was going to be a long term solution hence I didn't add it to the list,btohqsg
I think some people have said must trigger manually for it to be online,btohqsg
I'm actually looking for a simple long term solution... Just set and forget,btohqsg
So Paynow into OCBC tagging ‚ÄúSalary‚Äù won‚Äôt work ?,btohqsg
Hi all. Just to check  if I were to use shopback pay (credit card linked) through the QR code at the restaurant  the dining MCC still remains the same right?,btohqsg
When u guys open ocbc 360 did u guys close the saving account?,btohqsg
Then u keep the min $$ in saving account?,btohqsg
Y don cancel? Any reason cos I tot 360account is saving account too,btohqsg
Interesting Maybank Horizon Visaincrease from 0.4 to 1.2mpd for insurance from 1 Nov. But reduce most local spending,btohqsg

Hi anyone know what‚Äôs the best card to pay for road tax? üôèüèª,btohqsg
It's not because you own credit card that you can't apply EGA. It's because you applied credit card online and they don't have record of your signature that's why you can't apply for the EGA account online. Just go branch,btohqsg
ntuc voucher yes  ecapitaland voucher through app no  ecapitaland thru wogi yes,btohqsg

Looking to sign up for either Stan chart journey card or simply cash card. Is it better to get the 35k miles or $400 Cashback? Also thinking of actual card usageI‚Äôm collecting miles but I have other cards with better rewards than those 2  might not be using it actively.,btohqsg
If you're already planning to go overseas within the signup period  I would say SCB Journey.Nov/Dec 2023 0% FX + 2mpd free (on top of the signup bonus?)Practically no brainer to me.,btohqsg
SCB Journey has 2 PP Lounge passes per PP year  unless u already have more from $120K cards.Its points round up (3pts/1.2miles per S$1)  $0.17 local spend can earn 0.4 miles (1 point)  miles don't expire.,btohqsg
