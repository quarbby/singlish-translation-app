It‚Äôs a small thing  but still fun. Definitely helps to encourage spending üòÖ,btohqsg

Anyways  does anyone know if Amaze-linked Mari Credit Card still get cashback? Not for foreign spending  but just want to dodge that 1% fee for SGD transactions processed overseas (Spotify  Apple),btohqsg
Technically thecrypto.comcard does that but it'scrypto.comso yea lol,btohqsg

Hi experts  I have some US dollar cash that I would like to put into my investment platforms like IBKR  Syfe etc.. for usd stocks.I understand I will need to go through a bank to transfer to these platforms. If I will to deposit USD cash into banks in usd accounts.Question: Any bank that don‚Äôt charge a fee for US dollar deposit? Or which bank charge the lowest and what is the percentage?Thank you in advance.,btohqsg
cannot use ezlink mastercard topup other ewallet,btohqsg
Cannot. YouTrip also cannot.But people use it to buy snacks.,btohqsg
If you have access to a sole proprietor or company  Aspire should work. Deposit USD to Aspire. They will auto convert to SGD in close to mid market rates. From there free withdraw to any local bank account. And you can then transfer to wherever,btohqsg
Ok  so insurance still ok to use EZ-Link,btohqsg
Which card to use for ez link master card ?,btohqsg
Government services. And that 3 letter word.,btohqsg
But what card to use to topup EZ-Link,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know. I heard very complicated. üòÖ,btohqsg
Shows but it still says I am at level 1,btohqsg
Your screenshot shows you have fulfilled the 2 criteria in green,btohqsg
I am also curious about this but I‚Äôm pairing with Citi Rewards instead,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs still too new. Good thing is Mari will send you a notification of the cashback amount after each purchase. So perhaps can start to experiment‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I mean the Spotify and iTunes purchases üòÖVery annoying to pay DCC fees. If amaze can get rid of the DCC fees  really awesome,btohqsg
Yup I know what you mean. That‚Äôs exactly what I am using Amaze for. They suck for FX  but if it‚Äôs a SGD transaction processed overseas  no 1% DCC.My $3.98 iCloud plan is exactly $3.98  not $4.02 before I was using Amaze,btohqsg
But still level 1...  hopefully I get awarded with up to 6%. Anw thanks for the help üôèüèª,btohqsg
