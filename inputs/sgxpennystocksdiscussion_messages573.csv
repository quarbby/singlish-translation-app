✈️Pika World Daily Updates- 17 Nov 2021✈️🪂The Talk of 2 Giants⏰It was like a rainbow after a stormy rain. President Biden and President Xi had a robust virtual meeting during a 3-hour talk  showing signs of thawing in a relationship despite occasional strong words.President Biden is joined by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  reflecting the degree of the economic significance of the meeting. Not forgetting Jake Sullivan  who is the top China expert in the administration.🎙Relaxing and Calmness⌛️The conversation between the two leaders was described as cordial as they talked about their long-standing friendship. President Xi showed agreement with President Biden in climate change and encouraged more extensive discussion and cooperation.The press statement by both sides shows some level of restrains  although the US did point out concerns on human rights and the nature of trade and economic practices that seemed unfair. The Taiwan issue was on the card too as President Xi gave a strong word that should Taiwan independence be a reality  it breaks the line of tolerance and leads to China having to take draconian action.🎉A rare sign of harmonious moment🪜On the backdrop of this meeting is a sensitive spot. It is ushering some normalcy in bilateral ties that were stressful and challenging under President Trump era for both countries. However  it is also a period where China is becoming more assertive globally as its political  military and economic prowess continues to grow  which unnerve the critics of China in the US  making it harder for President Biden to go soft on China.In the spirit of striking a balance between competition and cooperation  it is heartwarming that both leaders acknowledged the need to have frequent communication to avoid any conflicts as both countries become more involved in activities around Taiwan and South China sea.Markets welcome the news as both leaders' concerted effort to ease tension despite clear hurdles that are to be overcomed that could very well shape the modern political economy of the 21st century.📮What's on the menu today?At 9.30 pm  we will have the building permits data which we expect to be at 1.638M  a rise from 1.586M in the prior period.FOMC members such as Williams and Bowman will be speaking too.It is 17 Nov  Wednesday  at 7.20 am in Singapore and 7.20 pm in New York. It has been a turbulent week as politics and economic data becomes mor,btohqsg

✈️Pika World Daily Updates- 18 Nov 2021✈️🏂Consumers on the GoRetail sales were rosy as the US economy continued to make a strong comeback as more sectors of the economy gained traction with the opening of many businesses. As a result  retail sales rose more than expected to hit 1.7%  reflecting the consumers' resilience in spending despite a higher inflation environment.Compared to the gain of 1.4% seen last month  it hints that the economy is still on a solid foot. Without any surprise  the main bulk of the increase comes from online retailers  which saw a gain of 4%. Grocery also registered a rosy start as sales jumped by 1.1%. In contrast  we know the restaurant and bar sales are essentially flat.📽Holiday season comes earlyThe exciting insight will be on the possible spending for the coming holiday season. It is expected that consumers may spend around $851 billion  which is a remarkable improvement from $777 billion or a 9.5% increase. We see mega-retailers such as Walmart preparing ahead of expected roaring demand and ordering inventories way in advance through the chattering of ships.Indeed  there appears to be a general trend that retailers are expecting consumers to shop early. This bodes well for the general market sentiments. Retail stocks have generally performed well for the year. For example  the XRT (SPDR S&P Retail ETF) rose 60%  while S&P 500 gains of 24% seem pale in comparison.💰Deep in the PocketWe do not see signs that consumers are paring their purchase. On the contrary  consumers are willing to spend more than before the pandemic as some jobs appear to be higher pay to retain staff. Wages and salaries were the biggest motivators in consumer spending  as shown in economic data.Although Pika World does not see inflation in the current context as a negative spark  the persistent long-term increases could encourage workers to find greener pasture and the cycle of job-hopping for higher salaries plays on. While wages do not always push price inflation generally  there is substantial concern that wage inflation can contribute to overall inflation.So what's the transitory story? It is simple. The case is for goods expenditure to decline in the future and service spending starts to moderate. This presents a cooling-off pressure on the supply chain. However  Pika World does not think it is happening anytime soon.📮What's on the menu today?At 9.30 pm  we will have the Initial Jobless Claims  which we expect to drop to 260K from 267K in the prior period.The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index for Nov is expected to notch slightly higher to 24.0 from 23.8 in the prior period at the same time.It is 18 Nov  Thursday  at 7.42 am in Singapore and 7.42 pm in New York. Economic data continues to drive the outlook of the market. Pika World wishes all an energetic week ahead!,btohqsg

This is a common misperception by many CPF members and is not true. CPF members need not rush to buy their properties before reaching 55 years old. They can reserve all or part of their Ordinary Account (OA) savings before they turn 55  to pay for their housing needs after age 55. The OA savings reserved will not be transferred to their Retirement Account (RA) and can be used to pay for an existing property or to buy one in future.https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/forum/forum-no-need-for-cpf-members-to-rush-to-buy-properties-before-age-55,btohqsg
