Hi  I used honeymoney code to sign up endowus and made SRS investment. I remember it mention the reward will deduct from my investment cost but it seems didn deduct it. Just wondering if I read wrongly or anyone encounter this problem? i can‚Äôt find back the reward article online to read again‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I'm using citi amaze card usually can reach 1k spending. Now planning to get a second card for travel/utility and offline payment. What is recommend.,btohqsg
Endowus fees are deducted quarterly in mid Jan  Apr  Jul  Oct,btohqsg
Travel is UOB lady or dbs wwmc. Dbs card is more flexible and can be used to cover all online spend and you can use amaze + crmc for offline. However  it has 1y expiry so that's a problem.,btohqsg

Hi  I‚Äôm deciding on the category for UOB Lady‚Äôs card. If I‚Äôm looking to use it for furniture and electronics purchase? Which category should I choose?,btohqsg
I can‚Äôt tell which category is best  cos all seem not applicable. Beauty/Dining/entertainment/family/transport/fashion/travel,btohqsg
An alternative is to choose fashion and buy vouchers withHmsg.link/heymax,btohqsg
#DP#TransferUSDI just transferred USD from SCB USD savings account to IBKR USD cash account. Used SCB REMIT function.*It is totally free.* Took just about 24 hours (I transferred at 1pm Tuesday  just got message funds received in IBKR),btohqsg
Hi expert  when can I transfer out all the funds for my SC marathon esaver bonus in order to get the next bonus interest?,btohqsg
If opposite transfer from ibkr usd to sc usd? Any charges.,btohqsg
Oh is it cheaper that way? Is it a specific account? I never thought about doing this  I've always funded using SGD,btohqsg
if you have USD in your Singapore bank accounts  you can consider utilising it this way,btohqsg
I just saw this but when I logged in to read. Nothing new mentioned.,btohqsg
what is the best miles card for a payment of $4k air ticket,btohqsg
if SQ Group  use UOB KF CCif others (airline website)  use Maybank Horizon Visa Signatureif OTA (in white list)  use UOB KF CC after you meet $800 SQ Spend,btohqsg
but if buy that 4k ticket like once every blue moon  still go for maybank horizon vs or any other card is sufficient?,btohqsg
i don't think u have other cards that can give meaningful miles/rewards for $4k air ticket spend,btohqsg
i see  anyway i am still stuck on using ocbc 365 and Hsbc revo card.should i replace my hsbc revo card with uob ppv or citi rewards + amazequite hesistant to jump to citi + amaze that idk when this combo will end‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Can split? If can  2x dbs wwmc for 2 pax up to 3k.,btohqsg
Choy. Even when it ends  it is better than hsbc revo for offline spend.,btohqsg
When you attend a party  don‚Äôt worry about when the party will be ended. Dance as much as you can when the party is still on-going. üíÉ,btohqsg
Is it to IBKR SG or IBKR US ? or actually doesnt make difference?,btohqsg
i transferred to IBKR US... who uses JP Morgan Chase in US..not sure about IBKR SG,btohqsg
ah ok - my acc is also IBKR US but i am not sure if i ever want IBKR SG in the first place,btohqsg
why i think it MIGHT matter... i suspect i escaped the USD10 charge because JP Morgan Chase themself is the Correspondent Bank / there is no Correspondent bank,btohqsg
Hi  does charging cardup to uobone credit card will be accounted as  the  $500 min spend for uob one acc interest?,btohqsg
Cardup is excluded by uob one card if i did not rmb wrongly,btohqsg
