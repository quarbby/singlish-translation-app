RP is actually a scam bro,btohqsg
Act thought RP is easier to score in GPA for certain courses compared to NP and SP,btohqsg
At least thatâ€™s the tactic some of my friends used,btohqsg
what do people even learn in business course actually,btohqsg
for a long time i thought it was econs but watered down,btohqsg
yea...i withnessed it firsthand  ive said it countless of times...rp does not regulates how the lecturers give grades...the only thing they do is ask lecturers that fail students to write a whole report on why they failed them,btohqsg
If lecturers want to they can level 4 both this,btohqsg
and this..then level 2 our aks or attainments of skills and knowledge ...and we still get a B,btohqsg
how is RP a real poly,btohqsg
they can easily manipulate the grading system to fit the grade they feel like giving,btohqsg
that was literally what ive been asking since i ended sem1,btohqsg
that's why im not actually giving excuses...im legit already trying my hardest,btohqsg
but i cant do anything about a system that was built so badly from the start,btohqsg
if ur choosing between ITE or RP  go ITE,btohqsg
at least ITE isnt so rigged,btohqsg

nope im already 2 years in alr  im interning next sem,btohqsg
Lol you know a polyâ€™s bad when this statement isnâ€™t a take as hot as the sun,btohqsg
it is  my classmates using chatgpting to get their A and B grades,btohqsg
only reason u should go RP is sonic arts,btohqsg
while im trying to be actually honest to my ownself...,btohqsg
The sports courses are pretty ok,btohqsg
But I donâ€™t think the people in them study anyways LOL,btohqsg
im not chatgpting any of my quizes...the lecturers said b4 its not allowed..but i see my classmates constantly doing it,btohqsg
and im slowly falling into the pressure to actually use it,btohqsg
if he was ACTUALLY rigged  he would still be getting more Bs,btohqsg
anything below just means hes doing jack shit,btohqsg
They donâ€™t want it to happen they should design a more foolproof system,btohqsg
ITE people are nice msot of the time,btohqsg

Nah itâ€™s important but it doesnâ€™t alter the trajectory of your life that much,btohqsg

tf do they even quiz u on for it to be so shit,btohqsg
its not that far from what other polys i dont think  but my classmates told me that students from other poly's are not taught as much as rp students,btohqsg
I went to the inaugural apex day,btohqsg
