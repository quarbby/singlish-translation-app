Not so much in engineering but open to the idea as of now,btohqsg
More so in radio bc I know whatâ€™s gg on la,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ thats for students who enter with pure a level cert?,btohqsg
Wow thats v heavy lei but she has 3-yr diploma alr,btohqsg
Itâ€™s in the picture u sent,btohqsg
Anyone know where to but resistance bands,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s a shop in novena and mayb online,btohqsg
But she alr have a 3-yr dip oh. Not pure alevels cert,btohqsg
Not sure if people know about Higher School Certificate (HSC)  the predecessor to A levels and School Certificate (SC)  the predecessor to O levels,btohqsg
U can try decathalon but dk if have,btohqsg
Haha carousell so that the person can pass to u asap,btohqsg
Used to be pure mathematics+ statistics+mechanics in core and f maths,btohqsg
Another thing I find odd about A and O levels in the omission of the composition symbol in composite functions. f\circ g compared to fg,btohqsg
Functions r kind of handwaved in the O and A syllabus,btohqsg
But i guess it is quite demanding to ask students to go rigorously into the definition of functions and its properties,btohqsg
Well  at university  they essentially taught it in 15-20 minutes? Basically  they taught the definition  injectivity  surjectivity and bijectivity and how to prove them. Then they went onto proving left inverse is equivalent to injectivity. Right inverse is equivalent to surjectivity by Zorn's Lemma  which is equivalent to the axiom of choice so they didn't prove it at the time (too complex). So we conclude from there that a function has an inverse iff it is bijective.,btohqsg
Which is awful  because they are so important. I know the definition is not that intuitive but when you compare it to the epsilon-delta definition  hahaha  it's no match,btohqsg
I only know pre-image is open/s,btohqsg
Do you mean definition of a limit or definition of continuity using a limit,btohqsg
Continuity is easier to understand from the definition of a limit  but epsilon-delta isn't intuitive at all,btohqsg
I'm not an analysis person anyways,btohqsg
If you ask math profs I think they will use the Topological definition of continuity instead.There's a trend for pure math stuff to not work in reals if not required to,btohqsg
Cuz it's where they need the eps-delta typically?,btohqsg
Unless you want to talk about a sequence of sets (with some containment requirements) instead  which is worse,btohqsg
I don't know. Not my interest,btohqsg
I'm doing logic now. Quite complicated. This is only the basics...,btohqsg
Not really. Essentially they came in and introduced something like this table  which makes sense. Then they introduced soundness  disjunctive normal form  conjunctive normal form etc. That's when it starts to get confusing.Now they are way past that... Sometimes I don't even know what is going on,btohqsg
Next part was partially on this,btohqsg
They also went through the MU puzzle,btohqsg
Even proving 1+1=2 isn't that easy  because you need to define addition.,btohqsg
Jeez it was a joke but I appreciate the breakdown,btohqsg
why is there no option for straight,btohqsg
This? Never seen this but I did learn satisfiability,btohqsg
Anyway  with the rise of CS  expect to hear about 3-SAT in general,btohqsg
There's no rise in interest of logic,btohqsg
But there is a rise general CS interest,btohqsg
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=S8Rnr3bAG3APhase 2 will likely last 'months',btohqsg
Baby boomers are those born after WWII,btohqsg
Really? there's no need to say that,btohqsg
Oh hahaha ok i mixed up,btohqsg
I want to be boomer  hahaha,btohqsg
My father was born in the colony of Singapore,btohqsg
Do u feel so - the betas in movies are always outshining the main,btohqsg
How is this gen even strawberry,btohqsg
They say strawberries r easily smashed,btohqsg
Because I guess it was my upbringing that impacted me the most. The time where you don't have people looking at their phones (except maybe tamagotchi)  people playing pokemon cards and not pokemon go etc. I don't play these but yeah.I regret I'm not old enough. I listen to 70s/80s music because my parents are older and they influenced me. So I'm a bit awkward being born in the 90s,btohqsg
Cannot apply even slightest pressure on them,btohqsg
Oh. Yes ba  boomers actually go thru a period of time where things change rapidly,btohqsg
All my friends are born in the 90s. I hardly ever mix with people born in the 2000s  except maybe now,btohqsg
I grew up running around my childhood no phones little tv just out there running,btohqsg
