i think NUS is a week early?,btohqsg
i hv 2 core 2 elect midterms,btohqsg
but i gave up on cs im sorry siyan / lestin / wyatt,btohqsg
thank you  good luck to u too,btohqsg
but i cant let stress get the better of me coz i hv been hving stress headache more often,btohqsg
and omg when i enter uni right  somehow all the stress GI symptom / headache start coming before an exam,btohqsg
Andrea do you recommend doing pharm,btohqsg
so i pop nurofen as preventive lmao,btohqsg
YK i only recently realised there's a dual nurofen paracetamol pill,btohqsg
like 2nd major in pharm sci,btohqsg
i dont even call it stress eating anymore,btohqsg
double major is not really allowed in pharmacy,btohqsg
coz i think the curriculum is too intense for someone to handle that and usually people use their UEs as cross map to fulfill their major,btohqsg
but in pharmacy there is only 12 modular credits of MCs,btohqsg
Damn ok  do you guys make the pharmaceuticals? Iâ€™ve never really looked into life sci majors cuz I only took physics lol,btohqsg
i think it depends on your true passion? if u are passionate about serving patients etc then go for it! But just be prepared that actually the demands of both the UG curriculum + the actual work is quite hectic (im gonna be honest  not gonna sugarcoat anything),btohqsg
but the pharmacy curriculum is not under CHS (it is on its own like bachelor of pharmacy)  and prepares u for pre-registration training post graduation (recently there is some curriculum structure change  hopefully during ur batch time it will be better organized lmao)...,btohqsg
i feel that some people loss their passion midway due to the intensity:-(,btohqsg
wait ur house key or what,btohqsg
i went out of my house without my wallet before,btohqsg
and i was alr late for school,btohqsg
but the sun is really crazy give me headache,btohqsg
i dun use cash at all so i bring a big ass wallet just for 2 cards that i need,btohqsg
im considering life sci/bio related degree then pgde,btohqsg
pharma is interesting but its not really recognised by nie so rah,btohqsg
prob pgde in case i suddenly dw teach anymore,btohqsg
cause if go nie ntu then difficult to pivot,btohqsg
do not be a teacher sorry to all teachers here,btohqsg
my og never goes out for lunch but they always find the wrong time to video call on wa,btohqsg
Don't be ruining the one career path i thought about since sec school :((,btohqsg
nobody wants to teach in a class full of rowdy kids ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
hahahaha if u rly want to then bless your soul,btohqsg
If NIE doesnt accept my low af gpa then i guess its a blessing in disguise,btohqsg
all my family friends with kids all say,btohqsg
they wld rather send their kids to NUS/NTU than tsinghua or peking,btohqsg
no way my parents want me to go tsinghua,btohqsg
cause tsinghua and peking don't provide education with a global perspective,btohqsg
you're stuck with the China & CCP mindset,btohqsg
that doesn't earn you money in the long term,btohqsg
everyone who's capable are diversifying away from china and that includes their kids,btohqsg
Sry exchange is not in the vocabulary of a pharmacy ug,btohqsg
Oh yea  if u planning on that  then i dun recommend pharm  like it is not worth it + it is a very specialised course,btohqsg
is biz less specialised in a sense,btohqsg
I nearly went to nie  wanted to teach econs / math but nie too far for me so here im suffering,btohqsg
tbh im not very sure also whether i prefer molecular bio or zoology,btohqsg
all ik is i dont like physiology,btohqsg
Biz is very broad  im not sure but i think ppl get to specialize sort of in y2/3 (?),btohqsg
biz so broad what u want to do specifically,btohqsg
My parents have been advicing me AGAINST it,btohqsg
