"quote here ""As my philosophy is when counter price trend is down & especially when US 3 indices were down last night  it is important to refrain from discussing excessively & thus  i would make my last comment until mkt closes @ 5.04 later  The fall in price below what CEO Peter & SSH bought @ 41 & 42 respectively was due to last night' s US indices & we can see that majority of popular counters in SGX have been down since 9am.   Ok  enough & i shhhhhhhh until after mkt closes.""",btohqsg
