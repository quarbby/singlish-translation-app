maybe they didn't make the cut for uni,btohqsg
i mean poly also can go uni right,btohqsg
if anything i see myself changing from jc to poly,btohqsg
Dont worry im 20 my peers are 18-19,btohqsg
but idw go jc so it wont happen,btohqsg
Or mathematician. Generally you need A levels or the equivalent to take mathematics in university. Polytechnic doesn't give the foundation,btohqsg
well i rather get a diploma than fail alevels,btohqsg
unless u wan do theoretical shit  just go to uni or work from poly,btohqsg
i wanna enter arts stresm tho,btohqsg
H2 hist  econs  CLL/lit H1 chem :D,btohqsg
I'd suggest that you take H1 math,btohqsg
waste time imo unless its really sure what u wanna do,btohqsg
2 years can do a lot,btohqsg
You can argue mathematics is more art than science. Some people argue it this way,btohqsg
haha imo a level math is just sci,btohqsg
from the sound of it even uni math oso is sci,btohqsg
Not really. Did they take applied courses  like most?,btohqsg
they not v creative  very scientific,btohqsg
But then again js high af,btohqsg
But pure mathematics has many kinds,btohqsg
frens who took math all nerdy nerdy,btohqsg
but i didnt take amath in sec sch & my emath is a C5 ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
only girl who i know who take math her grades not good and she feel she dont belong,btohqsg
Most go on the applied path. Pure mathematics doesn't really attract people,btohqsg
i got one pure math fren  he surround himself w all the pure math scholars,btohqsg
thats why i get to talk to them,btohqsg
but no offence they v nerdy,btohqsg
i'd rather not be like that,btohqsg
"omg cool i'll be ""enslaved"" to math for another 2 years",btohqsg
Those generally are not the best. People that are really really good do not get the top grades a lot of the time. Too boring.,btohqsg
Too boring until they don't do as well,btohqsg
Okay well  but not so well,btohqsg
dunno la but they all cfm do postgrad or got scholarship or what the fuck not,btohqsg
See if they win the fields medal or not in the future. No Singaporean has won that yet.,btohqsg
ok extra note: a lot of them china,btohqsg
Chinese nationals generally don't really win fields medals. I can't recall any. And they are generally more into applied mathematics,btohqsg
A lot are American  British  French and Russian,btohqsg
Americans and british  many are very good,btohqsg
the math for econs is pretty fun,btohqsg
i nvr passed math before in my life since P3 other than major exams xp,btohqsg
i did v well for math,btohqsg
it's interesting how they can use math to simulate concepts in other disciplines,btohqsg
did well cuz of tuition or whatever idk,btohqsg
i did v badly for math and i hate it,btohqsg
The famous Bourbaki from France... Not a real person,btohqsg
