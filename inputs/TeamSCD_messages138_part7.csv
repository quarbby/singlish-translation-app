It's not time to sell the car,btohqsg
it's time to sell the wife,btohqsg
Roi woke up this morning and chose violence,btohqsg
If it's still a 4 door sedan or hatch  no good reason for the wife to say time to sell,btohqsg
Cos still can bring baby around,btohqsg
Unless the car keeps breaking down and costing a lot of money,btohqsg
I sense that the husband keep spending money on the car instead of her,btohqsg

I remember when i was a smol boi and ‚Äúturbo‚Äù was a button on the sega controller,btohqsg
I rmb when i was a kid  there were still those demo xbox 360 and PS3s at comics connection,btohqsg
I once saw a dad and his kid playing ridge racer,btohqsg
and the dad kept referring the NOS/Turbo as horsepower,btohqsg
So he kept asking the kid to press the horsepower press the horsepower,btohqsg
Technically he is more correct than if he said turbo,btohqsg
