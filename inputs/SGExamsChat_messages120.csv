Hey guys  so I just want like to gauge like the general opinion on the arts in Singapore here,btohqsg
What do you think of joining the arts industry,btohqsg
Arts scene is quite pathetic I guess,btohqsg
No money starve on the streets,btohqsg
And do you think we will be better off or worse off in 25 years,btohqsg
Or become an sph visual designer,btohqsg
Will definitely be better but I can't imagine it ever catching up with other jobs,btohqsg
There's not many jobs out there that uses arts directly,btohqsg
Nice  thank you for your insights,btohqsg
I recommend u apply to imda scholarship,btohqsg
Id say follow your dreams but like idk hows that worked out for others in sg,btohqsg
hahah I am really not interested in getting institutionalized,btohqsg
I recommend u look at it,btohqsg
And to someone who's so sceptical of shit,btohqsg
When I say good it's really good,btohqsg
I have considered it many times haha,btohqsg
Have you looked at the terms for imda yet?,btohqsg
I heard most govt scholarships arent that good,btohqsg
Look at it and decide after,btohqsg
I researched some cyber sec scholarship and people said dont go for it,btohqsg
Forgot which company but maybe imda,btohqsg
IMDA and NAC are both scholarships that I have researched thoroughly tbh,btohqsg
And my conclusion is that I rather do a local degree and launch things from the ground up,btohqsg
And how does serving half ur bond anywhere in the world sound like,btohqsg
I think most likely imda cause i havent heard of those 2,btohqsg
Imda is the only scholarship worth applying imo,btohqsg
The rest has 6 years of bs to serve,btohqsg
Meaning u can go Google in sv,btohqsg
That's still counted as serving bond,btohqsg
You dont need to directly work for them?,btohqsg
Ill look further into it then,btohqsg
That's why I say what I said,btohqsg
I'm gonna call it now lolThe arts is a death sentence if you go in by the narrow minded route of thinking that only a 4 years degree overseas that will set ur family back by S$500K in debts will let you succeed  and then you just try desperately to apply for jobs while falling into the tunnel vision mindset of jumping from waiter job to packer job while making half finished artwork that never sells on the marketThe arts is not a death sentence if you are extremely proactive in getting your community to band together and make projects that people can recognise  and you know how to market things and turn it into a regional household name. Singapore arts is suffering from A LOT of problems... from a low public opinion to low industry morale  but like all other problems  this one can be solved too. Yes it's going to take a lot of people and a lot of energy on our part and there will be so many skeptics along the way but if someone can lift a 3rd world country out of poverty in one generation  surely we can lift the arts industry out of this downwards spiralI guess what I'm trying to say is that there is hope for our arts industry  and because I believe in it  I'm going to throw in my lot,btohqsg
I didn't read everything but gonna give u kudos just cos of ur final sentence,btohqsg
I believe this is indicative of the investing industry as well. Too many investors just wanna get their IRR quick  but investing in impact requires patient capital and alot of support,btohqsg
Indeed  the arts is not a stable route. I mean  we all know that lah... but it's an industry  and like every industry that has ever been created  only the most active and hardcore people make it to the top. Even then  the average arts graduate will generally be able to find employment within the industry  it's a matter of whether they are willing to fight for it and create their own opportunities where there are none,btohqsg
I've utmost respect for ppl in arts. I don't want to conflate the economic value to its inherent value for beauty; that's insult,btohqsg
One of the really cool things about art right is that it's making something from nothing. I can bring a bunch of actors together and have nothing more than an iPhone  and if we collaborate on a script  practise together  make it good and edit it out on iMovie  we have a film,btohqsg
I won't even care for its industry. Ppl who make it big big-time make it posthumously,btohqsg
This is a big group so I'm not promising anything here  but yes we are planning something haha,btohqsg
Eh let's stay away from naming certain brands,btohqsg
I like my Android and Adobe,btohqsg
Haha just saying something that's accessible and recognisable to most people,btohqsg
you mean the surname Tan isit,btohqsg
They have their value and appeal to certain audience la,btohqsg
Personally I am determined to walk the tightrope between artistic social value and commercialism,btohqsg
I mean  American films... look at them. How are they able to be so commercially viable and yet culturally influential at the same time? Simple  don't lose your ÂàùÂøÉ --- don't lose track of what you started out as,btohqsg
The certain youtuber he sort of fell into that trap of personal gain... the content is created just to boost his youtube revenue. Nothing wrong with that  he has his fans  but he won't be winning any awards for SG.,btohqsg
Then again not all change is bad,btohqsg
I mean change isn't bad if it's for the better,btohqsg
but perverting it into just mindless income generation  we all know what happens,btohqsg
Hard to appraise what's good and bad once u are in it,btohqsg
Then again if I can exploit certain tastes to generate income and channel that income to places where capital is needed,btohqsg
Money is money  it's neither good nor bad until you use it,btohqsg
PS I dunno who is that lor,btohqsg
I followed him since he made his first SG YouTubers video,btohqsg
not sure why it got taken down,btohqsg
doesn't it fall under fair use,btohqsg
hahahah I'm not a hard core fan la,btohqsg
But his content is still pretty raw,btohqsg
have we met in the old sgexams chat,btohqsg
the old ppl are rising again?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  the link to the panel live stream taking place later can be found here:https://youtu.be/Qfrpoc74UwY,btohqsg

Lol ppl wanting to go OCS,btohqsg
while me wanting to go SA job to get a good pprtfolio relevant to work irl,btohqsg
not if u go there for the sake of showing that ure an officer,btohqsg
Instead of getting occifer rank for 1.5 yrs,btohqsg
depends on what you‚Äôre looking for,btohqsg
if you get S1 or S4 role as an officer you basically get free job experience for resume,btohqsg
nah ive been through all the echelon so im most unbiased,btohqsg
had my fair share of mono intake  scs and ocs so depending on what you want ocs can be worth and not worth,btohqsg
which is why you needa be specific,btohqsg
u go thru scs and ocs?,btohqsg
Wait no such thing as SA in army,btohqsg
you mean PA to high ranker?,btohqsg
im a PA for an ME6,btohqsg
Isn't this the one who do the vocation one,btohqsg
But not just PA got other stuff like coy support etc,btohqsg

Nsf can be direct PA also,btohqsg
my boss doesnt disturb me much,btohqsg
pretty pampered life as a PA tbh,btohqsg
Coz army mah nth much to do,btohqsg
That fella agrees to disagree oni,btohqsg
but back to topic  there are NSF PAs ard.,btohqsg

Current/modern day music reimagined to be from medieval times,btohqsg
If one were to do an arts degree,btohqsg
so like hist geog also counted,btohqsg
BFA is more like performing arts,btohqsg
In the United States  the Bachelor of Fine Arts degree differs from a¬†Bachelor of Arts¬†(B.A.) degree in that the majority of the program consists of a practical studio component  as contrasted with lecture and discussion classes.,btohqsg
so bfa got art practical or music practical,btohqsg
actually if lets say we are talking about for example Dance,btohqsg
BFA in Dance in 2/3rd major  1/3rd liberal arts and electivesBA in Dance will be 1/3rd major  2/3rd liberal arts and electives,btohqsg
So there's a ratio and apparently it's roughly like this globally,btohqsg
boars vibing = boaring = boring,btohqsg

@cauchycriteriondo you have tys for fm,btohqsg
Use promo papers and what not,btohqsg
@chemcerShould I explain what I said in O-level chat? TBH I think the question while loaded feels very wrong.Like I understand the question/answer will be very obvious and have a clear answer if say  you consider the space of all normal distributions.But if you consider the space of ALL DISTRIBUTIONS then boi gg you are in for a rough ride,btohqsg
Student's t at 2 degrees of freedom has infinite variance,btohqsg
TBH I didn't check the Student's t PDF but it should be fine,btohqsg
I integrated both the student t PDF as well as the Norm Dist PDFs becase uhhh  not much other easy way to get the CDF,btohqsg
You can see that the infinite variance curve has steeper CDF near 0,btohqsg
I rather not tell O-level students about infinite variance curves though,btohqsg
Another thing is obviously I can play with the variance of the normal distribution to make it look as steep/non-steep as I like  relatively speaking,btohqsg
But all real numbers are less than infinity,btohqsg
I assume the only possibility is that *there A L W A Y S* exists intersection points between the two CDFs  but I can't be bothered to prove it,btohqsg
Proving the existence should be easier than showing/solving for it at least  but it's nonlinearity means urghhhh...,btohqsg
production quality on this is üëåüëåüëå,btohqsg
