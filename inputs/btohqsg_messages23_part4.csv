Not owner but heard from another group about key collection this weekPerson received SMS last week,btohqsg
Thing is  loan might not get revised upwardThere were people who shared that loan amount in HFE will stay the sameMaybe picture will be clearer few years later when people who applied for HFE collect their BTO keysHFE - SBF  maybe can also ask if they get re-assessment when nearing key collection but their waiting time are usually shorter  so not sure if will make any differenceAs for HLE  it is said that HDB will contact applicant few months before key collectionIf income higher now - no change to loan (unless appeal?)If income decrease - re-assessment and maybe get lesser loan,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt know which location to choose. I stay in Punggol. Woodlands  Yishun and Jurong are all so far and foreign to me.,btohqsg
Singles can only choose non-mature. Tampines is considered mature right?,btohqsg
