It was a trading full of hope for a relief bounce and a muted trading session.Despite the relatively slow movement in indices  beneath the show are big caps shifting gear swings  with Apple trending lower while Amazon shifting higher.It does not help that US is rallying G7 members to consider investment curbs on China  dampening risk-on sentiments and dashed hopes for any recovery towards the weekend.Next week bring us big tech earnings.

All q to buy mask ..,btohqsg
But what he says is correct right? If rental too high does not make biz sense then don’t rent right? It is not as though they had no choice forced to rent which our company always experience from our big customers,btohqsg
COE  housing super high.Only for Chinese rich to be hereGo Malaysia Thailand Indonesia for retirement,btohqsg
My neighbour in Malaysia bought this  for $100k Rm,btohqsg
I better rent out my apartmentand retire in Malaysia,btohqsg
How to do business in Singapore?So high price,btohqsg
Soon Singapore will be in recession.Too high price who can afford???,btohqsg
EV expecting to become more expensive soon?,btohqsg
If no one rents the stalls at those high prices  automatically they will reduce the rental prices. Problem is the stalls all got taken up. Demand n supply leh,btohqsg
Agree. That is why so many biz give up then when enough give up auto the prices will lower. If there are takers of high prices difficult to reject it right? Same way as property owners if can rent at higher rentals which landlord will want to rent out at lower rentals?,btohqsg
Singapore no advantage of technology but to attract super rich from China,btohqsg
Frankly I too think cost in Singapore has gone too high bcos small place n so many people want to come here n global inflation add to the problrm,btohqsg
The biz catering to them huat lor,btohqsg
Some Huat some at a loss,btohqsg
Govt has to balance nicely asap but I think such situation is fluid n not stabilised yet lah.,btohqsg
Actually the whole world is in a mess and unstable,btohqsg
Too expensive hopefully Lawrence Wrong can make miracleHopefully neighbour countries like Malaysia Indonesia Thailand go bust,btohqsg
Bigger countries hv more say than smaller countries esp trade now turn my protectionistic. Globalisation at stake too. If that happens Singapore will be in big trouble. If Govts prevent or stop their local biz invest overseas by law  we die,btohqsg
They hv big domestic mkt leh,btohqsg
Agree. Must watch a while for global picture to stabilise lah. We too small country hence cost easily go up esp Singapore so far so in demand n marketable,btohqsg
Actually in our company biz we notice Singaporeans funny: if they can buy a new brand of item at lower prices they still buy the high price items they hv been using even savings as high as 30-40%!,btohqsg
Fact is times are bad globally n tougher for smaller countries like SG that depend on globalisation. That is my view lah,btohqsg
My car will expire in three years times…,btohqsg
Understand your anxiety. I realise I mostly park my car so I sold it n now take grab. Much cheaper,btohqsg
Than expensive is correct mah lol,btohqsg
That's the point of COE in the first place,btohqsg
Because I paid no debt but I better sell,btohqsg
May be Govt shd consider coe quota for foreigners n separate for locals?,btohqsg
Is the foreigners pushing up COE prices?,btohqsg
Or like golf club membership local n foreigners hv separate prices,btohqsg
Foreigners I think only park money here... they don't park themselves here lol,btohqsg
I am ok lar my car fully paid 5 years ago,btohqsg
But fact is Govt n locals do benefit by their money being here leh. I think their family members may be here too n they consume here too leh,btohqsg
I sold my 6 year old car at 60% of my purchase price. 😂,btohqsg
That's why people can fully pay up their car mah.... lol,btohqsg
Some locals benefit  some lose lor. Those who gain never speak up 😂😂😂,btohqsg
I not disagreeing with inflation but I think COE not the right thing to complain about inflation 😂,btohqsg
Same as housing n foreigners here: who earn the high rentals? But then the new buyers suffer so I suggest to them wait lah. I think prices shd come down,btohqsg
But in any situation  sure have some win some lose mah... must learn to pivot lor,btohqsg
I don’t know but I am sure Singaporean landlord earn higher rentals too. I know my friends do,btohqsg
Aiya retire alse where car very cheap,btohqsg
You can Lah bcos you bought property before mah. And you can rent out at high rental to live overseas 😂,btohqsg
Erm... ok so we in agreement 😂,btohqsg
If car is your only concern  why not... as long as you can get PR in other countries,btohqsg
I hv always said locals some benefit some lose leh. Problem is those who lose keep speaking so loudly leh 😂,btohqsg
I want to be fair Lah,btohqsg
I know ar.. but I did not know what was your point 😂😂,btohqsg
Ops my sharing that bad ah 😬. Locals complain about the high cost etc etc mah,btohqsg
Locals complain about everything  in our blood de.. too cheap say defective too high say cannot afford... 😂😂,btohqsg
Yes. Looks like we both know locals too well 😂😂😂. Locals hv a choice but they die die must consume the higher price items when there are alternatives. In my younger days to budget we had to buy some cheaper food to balance with a few occasions of “better” food. Nowadays everyone wants to only eat good food bcos of yolo Haiz,btohqsg
And if pay up car after 2-3 years of loan is sibei bo hua.... because of rule 78 😂,btohqsg
I local know local mah 😂,btohqsg
I still sitck to coffeeshop food  only use grabfood once before because cheaper than go there buy 😂😂,btohqsg
Young people worse grew up in so much better living environment that their parents struggle to build up their savings then can consume like that  they take all these for granted n think is a given,btohqsg
Working with younger generation also hard.. did some interviews  almost faint,btohqsg
I do comparison too n not go by brands blindly,btohqsg
Yes me too 😂. Looks like we hv same experience,btohqsg
Want high pay  want wfh  want work life balance but no skillset....not happy just resign  no need find work first de... sibei ho,btohqsg
Exactly. I hv been thinking if we got shutdown by covid longer n not hv foreigners here to say service aircon  do plumbing job etc etc can our locals do these and charge us how much to get these jobs done. I dare not think much 😢,btohqsg
This I benefited from.. because I go youtube learn how to do small things myself 😂.. the young families I know just pay whatever the workers ask lol,btohqsg
I respect you leh 👍 self motivated.,btohqsg
That time WFH  have time mah... but I still prefer work in office.. more efficient,btohqsg
Nice chat with you. Need to sleep now. Goodnight 🙏,btohqsg
Actually im at fault i tell the young YOLO spent more. Cos if they also save. My money become smaller in future,btohqsg
No need stats I know of many rich Chinese arrivals,btohqsg
All buying nice car and property,btohqsg
Wah long time did not hear from you leh brother. You doing fine? 😂,btohqsg
I'm in China btw so personal knowledge,btohqsg
They always wanna invest i say go ahead,btohqsg
Yes hv been following your postings. China domestic still not too ok yet right?,btohqsg
If they success i how to success,btohqsg
If tthey eat restaurant food best,btohqsg
What do you mean by domestic not ok? If you mean XJP then yes it sucks. It's taken a step back thats why many went SG also,btohqsg
Common prosperity is not motivational talk for rich Chinese,btohqsg
If due to fear of common prosperity n what had been happening there I would do the same as them lah,btohqsg
My landlord was asking me how to move money out to SG too,btohqsg
Not all rich are corruption. But there are of course,btohqsg
i4i4i4anyway i talking cock la. Hahaha but u get the point. Been okay la working nowaday n doing daily husling,btohqsg
Exactly. That is why I would do the same too to move my money out,btohqsg
Dig deeper I think sure have some form of grey area type of dealings ba,btohqsg
Singapore only recently raised it's requirements for family office,btohqsg
They talk only la if u say u got someone 60-40 they tell u so exp,btohqsg
Not only china want move out ba... the neighboring country or island also want ba 😂,btohqsg
Probably but Chinese are the majority as it stands,btohqsg
Ya. Locals complain but foreigners appreciate our country.,btohqsg
If he okay wif 60-40 ask r chinese come la,btohqsg
Same la in australia the citizens cannot take it,btohqsg
U go sydney lo its like chinatown,btohqsg
Frankly this is normal human behaviour. When Singaporeans go work overseas we also take their local jobs what n bring our friends too. Happening always,btohqsg
Frankly I think they are everywhere 😂,btohqsg
They do go many places but SG is hot lately,btohqsg
Anyway i tell u he knows how to move just he dowan to pay to move his wealth,btohqsg
US used to be top choice now gone down due to the issues,btohqsg

But without foteigners i cnanot increase my rent,btohqsg
You see! You as local benefit lor 😂😂😂,btohqsg
I lease out too but will your rent cover your costs longer term? Debatable,btohqsg
I said some locals win some lose,btohqsg
Don't rent to locals lar... if locals need rent in SG  9 out of 10 is got issues de,btohqsg
I live overseas too so I even arbitrage my salary to COL,btohqsg
You see! You also know Singaporeans 😂😂😂,btohqsg
They wanna fk in day time,btohqsg
We all being honest Singaporeans here 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Got 1 vietnam boarding want rent I don't dare  even thought they offered higher rental😂,btohqsg

This is not about successful investors. They meant people with investable cash. Including those who arrived recently,btohqsg
Mc is one of them 😂,btohqsg
Not sure how to interpret but it is 1 out of 17 of local residents based on 4.1m.. guess depends if local residents include PR. And vulcan post says it excludes HDB but the survey methodology for investable wealth says it includes property. I guess stats is dependent on how 1 wants to interpret ba,btohqsg
It also includes listed company holdings... so a lot here likely part of the 240k lol,btohqsg
Says only liquid assets. Not real estate,btohqsg
Go to the henley global link and click on  the methodology,btohqsg
But actually even if excludes property and include new arrivals  we also LL suck thumb 😂,btohqsg
