Citi Rewards just announced effective apr 2024 new mcc code excluded from x10 point,btohqsg
Use ppv easier than vs. No min spend to hit,btohqsg
Should amaze x citi rewards be nerfed  any suggestions on how to spend the thankyou points accumulated if its insufficient for a full air ticket?,btohqsg
Citi Rewards on its own is still a pretty useful card. I would just spend and accumulate enough to transfer out.,btohqsg
Just use it for online purchases,btohqsg
Hmm it says any giro bill,btohqsg
Except....? Please read the whole document again,btohqsg
Excluding self iniated giro payments(?) And any HSBC credit card,btohqsg
Means those bill payments initiated by yourself on internet banking,btohqsg
Live chat only these 3 amaze excluded,btohqsg
Other amaze transactions are still earning 1x reward points but currently not the bonus 9x rewards points.,btohqsg
Bought an Apple Watch with CitiAmaze physically in store and did not earn 9x points. Asked CS and they could not give a proper answer. I guess CitiAmaze is dead…,btohqsg
is using a prepaid card good for a student?,btohqsg
So now what's the plan for online transaction since citi rewards is nerf?,btohqsg
Only citi rewards + amaze is nerfed.You can still get 10x rewards if you use citi rewards for online transaction,btohqsg
An expensive lesson for all of us,btohqsg
Darn. And I thought the HSBC revo nerf was bad. Looks like revolution is still the king of 4mpd cards after the new year's nerf massacre,btohqsg
Does citi rewards earns points with mobile contactless?,btohqsg
For shopping at retail for shoes etc have to tap the physical card to earn the 10x?,btohqsg
Dining MCC (used for changipay) didn’t credit me 9x as well with Amaze CRMC(Used for paying Koi),btohqsg
Just to confirm:If I link my Citi rewards credit card directly to FairPrice  ShopBack pay  FavePay  Shopeepay  using these apps to scan QR code and pay food expenses  can earn 10x points as its online spend correct?,btohqsg
Yes as long as it’s not via Apple Pay but directly linked as a credit card,btohqsg
Paywave not counted  ok got it  🙏🏼,btohqsg
No need  can use Apple Pay.,btohqsg
Can I check has anyone invested their CPF OA monies?,btohqsg
Doesn’t have to be online spend if you are spending in whitelisted retail stores. I have always tap my crmc using Apple wallet in Zara  Tangs etc,btohqsg
Sian arh  was planning to use crmc + amaze to buy stuff for my upcoming reno,btohqsg
What is the recommended way to invest CPF OA for the short term say about 3 years?,btohqsg
You can look into tbills or fixed d for short term,btohqsg
There are 2 parts to Citi Rewards if you know how the card works. You can either spend offline at qualifying retail stores or spend online.,btohqsg
Yes.. this is what i am asking.. the whitelist merchant.. was wondering if able to use mobile contactless,btohqsg
Nope. You can search the chat for the methods,btohqsg
One thing to consider is t-bill yield is trending lower. last is 3.7%  it has to be higher 3.3% to breakeven so the spread is not alot. OA investment is subjected to 1 time transaction fee + quarterly custodian fee.,btohqsg
Hi this is my miles strategy  can anyone please advise?Context:- spending around $1.5k a month on average- have a UOB one account that I want to maximise the interest rate1. Spend around $500 via UOB lady card for offline transactions (I chose dining category) and for all other offline non dining expenses (very little  less than $100 a month)  I will use my other UOB debit card since it is small amount2. All online transactions use DBS woman world card,btohqsg
since the neft of citixAmaze  try to add CRMC directly in shopback but unable to. not sure if citibank issue or shopback issue. Both app latest upated.,btohqsg
Did you try Linked payment methods -> Add credit card on Shopback?,btohqsg
yup  exactly that  unable to go thru,btohqsg
"just try with Fave  initially all ok  authorisation $0 citibank app pop up OK click approve. but then end up the message received: ""payment was declined. Please check payment details and try again.""",btohqsg
Can i ask if gxs debit card reward cashback on insurance payments? Cos it seems like they’re not included in this list,btohqsg
highly is citibank issue on this CRMC,btohqsg
Look Citi bank yet to clarify this,btohqsg
Maybe the person calculating/running the program to calculate reward point for Citi reward card got laid off in the recent Citi restructuring,btohqsg
But i think the cashback also is luck one,btohqsg
If it's in then it's excluded  not in then not excluded. Also it has to meet to the minimum transaction amount to be eligible for the cashbackchance.,btohqsg
I think with the Citi amaze nerf. S number of ppl will stay cancelling their Citi cards,btohqsg
Cancel n wait for the next sign-up bonus,btohqsg
Strange  my amaze transactions dated 20 Jan is confirmed eligible for 10x - Citi Rewards,btohqsg
Hi which miles card should I get for all offline miscellaneous payments ranging from dental to groceries to hospital health screening and more? I’m thinking of citi rewards + amaze combo  or uob preferred platinum (but rather avoid the $5 blocks),btohqsg
Did you check whether you got the points though? or just based on what the CSO told you?,btohqsg
Amaze+crmc is not working at the moment.,btohqsg
