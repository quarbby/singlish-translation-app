Those who took the pre-2006 A levels  they also used A1-F9 for the AO level papers. C6 is a pass.,btohqsg
If you really think you confirm f9 and won't use it then I guess you can don't take,btohqsg
Just that if your results were different,btohqsg
i tried dropping with parent letter and talking to HOD but they still didn’t allow me to drop at start of year siannn,btohqsg
Don't go regretting and think about the what ifs can liao,btohqsg
do u plan to go jc>,btohqsg
No...........need ask parents go to the school to say drop or what,btohqsg
got two days sia tmr n monday,btohqsg
But apparently you can do exams in hospital  so...,btohqsg
???? go see doc two times isit,btohqsg
iirc ur amath cher was like “lemme think ok” then he nvr say anyt,btohqsg
go get ice cream and maggi,btohqsg
shit till can't walk 2 days is in the bag,btohqsg
Or ice water if no money get ice cream,btohqsg
wah u creative HAHAHAHHA i swearrrrr,btohqsg
I guess the best way is to just apply for special consideration or whatever it is called  if you are eligible,btohqsg
u said like to him u wanna drop amath what,btohqsg
then he was like “lemme think abt it “ then aft that he nvr say anyt,btohqsg
yEZ he advised me to skip the paper,btohqsg
But your grade in the transcript will be annotated,btohqsg
just don’t go the paper they won’t ask for mc or anything,btohqsg
at the start of the yr,btohqsg
no but it was the HOD who said ‘lemme think’,btohqsg
Your transcript will have a '+' symbol beside the subject to show that special consideration/extra time etc had been given,btohqsg
thought she’s skipping ? not extra time or smth,btohqsg
Yeah  what I mean is if she can apply  then that might improve ger grades. Otherwise she is stuck with whatever she has,btohqsg
actually whats the pt of skipping the paper,btohqsg
or take halfway in the day then break time go home,btohqsg
got more time to study for other subjects,btohqsg
instead of taking it and failing it,btohqsg
is that 3hrs really gonna help,btohqsg
y’all can just be honest with ur opinion,btohqsg
Mess the skipping right then confirm bam gg case,btohqsg
Why not you just try? You don't know what you would get in the end,btohqsg
i mean if she isnt studying for it alr whats the point of taking it,btohqsg
But if you skip  it is guaranteed fail,btohqsg
You guys already studied for SS?,btohqsg
and mostly its about morals ah,btohqsg
I don't revise SS read the news the well read ones do better,btohqsg
its just not the right thing to do?,btohqsg
Did this I already take finish Os in As next year SS only SBQ,btohqsg
Don't try memorising whatever examples there are no point now,btohqsg
Legit dont need study to pass. The mcq is pretty much always 38-40/40,btohqsg
I dun even know how to apply. Dunno how to see,btohqsg
If really no choice then place all the eggs in one basket pin on SBQ,btohqsg
my friend gave up on pure history  like he didnt study for it at all  he still came for O levels last yr and got c6 ah,btohqsg
and amath is easier to score than a content subject,btohqsg
