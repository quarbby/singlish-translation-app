den alone drive car go meet family,btohqsg
tonight i go tell my wife this idea,btohqsg
my cousin in law when he had the mx5  he drives that  leaves the kid and my cousin in the 2nd car,btohqsg
My argument is always  if some families can survive on motorbikes only,btohqsg
why i cannot survive on MX5 only,btohqsg
hope your wife dont go beat up your 2nd wife (your car) haha,btohqsg
tell her get her own ride,btohqsg
it went well for my cousin in law  but eventually he sold the mx5 and changed to a mini,btohqsg
he restored it fully  but sold because didn't want to see it parked under the sun,btohqsg
I know of someone in the MX5 group  the guy drive mx5  wife drive mini,btohqsg
they used to be car dealers,btohqsg
so know where to get deals,btohqsg
similar story with mine  previous previous owner got it  restored  drove a few years then flipped it.  Owner after that drove half year  sold at a loss to me,btohqsg
dont think now can still earn from selling cars ba,btohqsg
if i sell now  i earn,btohqsg
but i see like stagnant alr,btohqsg
that's cos you buy your car awhile back ma,btohqsg
i bought in june last year,btohqsg
I mean like buying a car now to flip,btohqsg
but to be honest  if you plan to keep all the way  it doesn't matter the value,btohqsg
my fren got MGZS 2bids guarantee so dealer gt 2 chance to whack,btohqsg
i'd be happy if the coe drops all the way down  then give you chance to have another car,btohqsg
i got consider to buy a cheap daily,btohqsg
like attrage or simi also ok,btohqsg
hopefully next few years can find those 5 to 6k depre beater cars,btohqsg
i'd probably have to move to my own place before getting another car,btohqsg
