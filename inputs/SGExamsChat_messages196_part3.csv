The only thing you might not have to care about is accomodation I guess,btohqsg
i know like 3 people doing that alr,btohqsg
That's 3 people. Out of the thousands that go overseas and study.Some people don't go to countries where 'white people' are the majority of the populace.And even if they do  there are so many universities out there that are very good. How can you say those who go there are disgusting? When they come back to Singapore finding a job shouldn't be a problem.,btohqsg
these people literally talk about how they wanna get laid and party hard with that very race of people,btohqsg
i just didnt expect they'd stoop so low,btohqsg
to doing it while covid is still rampant,btohqsg
THREE people would change your opinion about a group consisting of thousands. Are you even serious?,btohqsg

Because their university forces them to go back,btohqsg
being disgusting and being employable is a whole different thing,btohqsg
im referring to those people SPECIFICALLY,btohqsg

HOW DARE YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT,btohqsg

im only referring to those who do,btohqsg
yah clearly referring to only those who do ^ ?,btohqsg
just cuz i dont specify the shit out of everything u say,btohqsg
get ur facts right before u talk so much tbh,btohqsg
i am gonna get nitpicked to death now?,btohqsg
why u even talking abt overseas kids,btohqsg
