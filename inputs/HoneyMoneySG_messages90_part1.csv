Has anyone tried to use ocbc 90n cc for simplygo as in tap in bus and mrt? Not sure how they charge. I am curious does it considered as qualifying monthly $500 spend for ocbc 360 account,btohqsg
Hi. How should my spouse and I manage household expenses if we don’t want to have a joint account yet want to split equally? Reason being joint accounts tend not to maximise interest. Or any recommendation for high interest joint account but low barrier (eg no crediting of salary req),btohqsg
For Visa  SimplyGo charges daily. For MC  SimplyGo charges after hitting $15 or 5 days whichever earlier. Then it'll take another 3-5 business days to post the charge.,btohqsg
Yes we did. Twice already. Still never change.Feel like complaining to mas about their trappy platform. How can u default to credit able account,btohqsg
Use another local bank no min account just for paynow to friends. Those close friends add as friends,btohqsg
That human not many banks left to open already.Rest need to use for musical chairs.,btohqsg
Understand how u feel. But unfortunately  MAS has no lever over bank app's user interface and experience,btohqsg
Who has the highest saving account (no lock)Maribank 2.88%?,btohqsg
I already said no and I had put in my savings account since sep23,btohqsg
SorryWho has the highest saving account (no lock)  no minimum sum  no conditionsJus leave yr $$ there  anytime can withdraw. Daily expense account  but still earn decent %Maribank 2.88%?,btohqsg
You register in Aug or Sep?,btohqsg
SEP n ending Feb. Now need search for another saving acc and considering esaver,btohqsg
He asking now  i don't think is available to him at this point of time.,btohqsg
Maribank or GXS up to 75k,btohqsg
SCB e-savers or hsbc EGA is much higher,btohqsg
Esavers need incremental funds but he’s using it for his daily expenses,btohqsg
It’s incremental vs Jan’s average. If jan’s average was zero  every $ is incremental. Anytime can withdraw,btohqsg
I’m sure they would step in if they are aware the app defaults to a loan account (26% pa) for account transfers.And did I mention the account selection is hidden below (user has to scroll the screen to see it). And user is able to press Send Money without ever viewing the selected account.,btohqsg
Hsbc ega 3.5% is just 2 month I believe (I maybe wrong),btohqsg
Even kopitiam is not spared CNY surcharge,btohqsg
Ya conclude maribank 2.88% is the highest for now 😄Also good on shopee  high cashback😆,btohqsg
Put Mari invest la .. average 3.8 draw out anytime .. ya it’s an investment but can draw out anytime la,btohqsg
Ain't similar to moomoo cashplusSince now giving 6.8  after which also around 3+🤔,btohqsg
This might be better but till Mar.A,btohqsg
Cash plus u need one day or so to withdraw .. he wants immediate withdrawal so Mari invest is the only one,btohqsg
Oh... tats the different.Great to know 👍,btohqsg
Is mari invest risk level similar to moomoo fullerton sgd cash fund?,btohqsg
May be 😊.. Let us know if u manage to convince MAS to nudge Maybank to really change the app experience,btohqsg
lol I just checked. They really did something!!! U can now see the debiting account before proceeding. Earlier u had to scroll down. I just complained last week before CNY. This definitely helps although defaulting to creditable still.,btohqsg
is recurring CC payment counted online transaction?,btohqsg
I think you gotta manually key in the details to count as online,btohqsg
Why it say total is $100 when there's fees?,btohqsg
is food panda apps consider as online transaction tooo ?,btohqsg
That’s another sneaky bit. It should have clearly said if u proceed 26% pa interest (min $5 per month) will apply.,btohqsg
Basically I feel it doesn’t make sense to allow a creditable account to “coexist” alongside a savings account at account selection stage  what more credit able being the default. lol.,btohqsg
If there is no criteria to be online/mobile transaction like UOB absolute so long it’s charged should be fine I guess? Hmm,btohqsg
Yeah I think soI think you can do some search hereYou should be able to find some data points.,btohqsg
Hi all  may I know if anyone face any issue using XNAP QR payment with their Apple Pay (iPhone) recently? Thanks 🙏,btohqsg

Anyone here awarded the grab evoucher $20 x 5 by uob Amex for eligible spend?Any issue using the evoucher to take grabtaxi?I asked cos I can't use those vouchers.. And so far  grab still have not responded to my queries...,btohqsg
Hi  i do not have experience with booking of flights before. I would like to seek suggestions for flight to Hong kong  how should i go about booking of the tickets for cheaper flights? Throughtrip.com  agoda or scoot website?I will be intending to use UOB lady's card.,btohqsg
Search for the cheapest options on skyscanner. Then  I recommend booking directly w the airline because if anything goes wrong  airline will direct you to the agent that you bought from to resolve (i.e. if you booked directly with them  you resolve with them  whereas if you booked through a website liketrip.comor agoda  you have to wait to talk to a customer service agent from there),btohqsg
Hard to say.. For example  Apple iCloud subscription charged to credit card on recurring basis is an online transaction and M1 recurring payment is not. The safest way is to pay manually,btohqsg
Hi guys  is UOB SimpleInvest worth parking my funds into?,btohqsg
I did rather buy the Fund myself  rather than buying ILP products... the admin fee  management fee etc will eat into your $,btohqsg
Yes  anyone bought it? Heard they give 5% on the sum u put in..for long term...,btohqsg
Heard it from dbs  posb & roadshow,btohqsg
