Hi guys. What's the best miles card if I monthly spend is around 2k up and spend on hotel and flight tickets,btohqsg
Would I get 4mpd from Citi Rewards if use it to pay with KRIS Pay app?,btohqsg
I didnt know too! Guess it makes sense to save up even more more miles on hsbc then,btohqsg
Yes  you can do that.Tax relief cap of 8k is shared between sa and ma.,btohqsg
no  cos kris+ app need to pay in-app via google/apple pay which is excluded from 4mpd. If u using android phone can workaround it by using Amaze+citi rewards mastercard on googlepay.,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply. Any suggestions to which card to use cos I‚Äôm using iPhone,btohqsg
dbs wwmc. or hsbc revolution/uob ppv for whitelisted online MCCs,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the end of the next month after your statement cycle. If your statement cycle is until Dec. Then the bonus points will be in jan,btohqsg
Oh I see  so if my transaction is in the cycle of 5 Nov - 5 dec then bonus points will be in Jan?,btohqsg
Yup. You will get the 1x first then the next month after your statement cycle then will have 9x if eligible,btohqsg
Ohhh ok  thanks! Got confused as somehow I got some bonus points but not all,btohqsg
Probably you got some other transaction in the previous months that qualify,btohqsg
Hmm yea  but I only started the card on the 22nd of Nov so not even 2 months but somehow I got 3k points when I haven‚Äôt even spent 2k with the card yet,btohqsg
Haha lol  extra points just take it. If January dont have then can call the bank,btohqsg
Hi all  is there a way to check how much we are away from the 8k cpf top up for tax relief? I remember singpass used to be able to see but seem like they already remove this. Thanks,btohqsg
Have to ownself check using historical transactions,btohqsg
I see. Quite disappointed that singpass remove that feature but thanks for clarifying Chris!,btohqsg

Hi EVOL experts! I noticed my EVOL Cashback credited this month is only 0.3%  after looking at last month‚Äôs bill  I noticed that I have spent >$600 in transactions  but after the Cashback credited last month  the net bill is $599.95.Is the Cashback computed based on the net bill? üò¢ Or the >$600 I spent in transactions?,btohqsg
I think no because of mobile app,btohqsg

Anyone knows any credit card which approvals can be done in a day to use immediately? I wanna catch a 1.1 promotion,btohqsg
Other 4-6mpd cards. Probably should wait to see Jan 2024 singsaver/moneysmart promo.If you new to bank credit card status  it‚Äôs possible get the card with most desirable rewards first then  after a while  get the card you actually want (for situation where the card you want has worse new to bank gifts),btohqsg
Iirc hsbc revo transfer fees is per year and not per transaction? And fee auto renews yearly.,btohqsg
Will I get 6mpd if pay mcc4131 under UOB Lady transport cat?,btohqsg
According to heymax  no.Read milelion article  no.https://milelion.com/2023/03/20/explained-which-mccs-are-included-in-the-uob-ladys-card-travel-category/,btohqsg
Can some1 clarify how does the cit rewards 4mpd work out? It'*s not a direct conversion to miles right? Need to convert from the earned points then to miles right?,btohqsg
Hello. Can I check what cards can be used to earn miles for lasik surgery at Clearvision?,btohqsg
Hi! For the hsbc revo card  if the 1st 1k I spend does not fall into the eligible transactions category and the next 1k I spend does  do I still get the 4k miles?,btohqsg
Is difficult because don't know which mcc code exactly. heymax suggests mcc 8011 / 8042. I'm assuming the mcc code is such and you're paying via contactless/ mobile contactless  and can get the cashier to allow you to use multiple cards to pay1) UOB visa signature 4 mpd  contactless payment  min 1k max 2k2) UOB preferred platinum visa 4 mpd  mobile contactless payment  max $1110.3) Amaze card linked to citi rewards 4mpd  payment via amaze  max 1k but incur 1% fee for mcc 8011.For those general spend cards  not certain.Hopefully someone else with real life experience can share,btohqsg

ah okie okie thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
For these 2 Mcc codes  Citi premier is a clear yes. DBS altitude = should be yes according to wording  as they exclude hospitals (8062).,btohqsg
