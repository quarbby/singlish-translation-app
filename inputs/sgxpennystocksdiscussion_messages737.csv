Newcastle coal futures rose to above $350 per tonne  and are more than 120% higher in the last 12 months  as demand outpaces supply. La Niña phenomenon  a pattern of weather in the Pacific Ocean that brings wet weather and flooding to Australia has hit coal production for miners including Glencore  BHP and Anglo American. Australia's exports of thermal coal are likely to tumble to 13 ml tonnes this year  down from 183 ml tonnes in 2021. Meanwhile  Indonesia's coal exports are expected to rise but remain below the government’s target. On the demand side  India's imports of thermal coal surged 14% in the first ten months of 2022 and output by state-run Coal India  which accounts for 80% of domestic output  rose 11.5%. Also  increasing energy security concerns in Europe  exacerbated by a ban on Russian coal  forced the reactivation of coal power plants.,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 23 November 2022🎉🎲All eyes on the FOMC minutes🗽Yes  that's right. After a broad-based decline on Monday  the equity market rebounded on Tuesday as investors looked forward to dovish FOMC minutes. This gave oil prices support  though a mild one.Market participants put behind the weakness seen from China's potential Covid lockdown  given that the country is a net oil importer. Moreover  Saudi Arabia denied news that it is exploring an increase in oil production  giving the price a boost. In recent months  oil prices have been sensitive to the prospects of China's opening up its economy.🎯The big deal: FOMC minutes📊Before Thanksgiving on Thursday  traders will have to clear a hurdle. There is a wish for the Fed not to over-hike to combat inflation  and that's what markets want to see in the FOMC meeting minutes.Investors are warming up to the idea of a recession but are hopeful of avoiding a deep one. And that expectation rest upon whether there is a possible shift in the steepness of rate increase to a milder one and any hints of slight pivot in policy changes. So you bet that everyone will be closely parsing the minutes for clues.The bond market remains relatively stable as fear is easing. Both the 2 and 10 years bond yield moderately retreat on a more cautious note.💣Bitcoin: Woes prolonged🧸When we thought the worst nightmare of the FTX saga was gone  Genesis  a leading crypto lending  signalled the need to raise cash. This pushes Bitcoin to hit a low of around $15 480. The failures of FTX are still sending after-math waves across different related players giving an inclination to large withdrawals.Nonetheless  Genesis maintained that it has no plans to file for bankruptcy in the near term and is having a good conversation with its creditors.📮What's on the menu today?📖There is a stream of economic data before Thanksgiving.At 9 pm  we will have the building permit data  which we expect to remain reasonably stable at 1.526M.Core Durable Goods Order for Oct (MoM) will be released at 9.30 pm. We expect a return to growth of 0.1% compared to a decline of 0.5% in the prior period.At the same time  Initial Jobless Claims is expected to meet 225K expectations. Robust job data will give Fed the confidence to maintain its pursuit of hawkishness.Manufacturing PMI for Nov is expected to moderate to 50.0 from 50.4 when released at 10.45 pm. The same applies to Service PMI  released at the same time. Contraction is still likely to be at 47.9.New Home Sales for October data will be given at 11 pm. A meaningful decline to 570K from 603K is expected.Finally  we arrive at the FOMC meeting minutes at 3 am  which is a potential market mover.It is 23 November  Wednesday  at 8.55 am in Singapore and 8.55 pm in New York. The US market is closed on Thursday  and we hope Pika World friends plan their trade carefully. Have a wonderful day ahead!,btohqsg

Is reduction of share capital good?Capital reduction can be used as a tool to achieve various company objectives: Paying dividends: The most common objective is the payment of dividends. Capital reduction allows the elimination of accumulated losses  which would otherwise prevent the payment of dividends  to create distributable reserves.,btohqsg
Capital reduction is the process of decreasing a company's shareholder equity through share cancellations and share repurchases  also known as share buybacks. The reduction of capital is done by companies for numerous reasons  includingincreasing shareholder value and producing a more efficient capital structure.,btohqsg

Even the management  boldly declares in the investor report- Geo energy shares being undervalued- Shares trading less than 1x EBITDA- US$215 million cash hoardIndustry outlook seems to benefit GEO too.After reading this  it shows management has now realised how undervalued their counter is.Since they have done the share buy backs recently   I believe they might be undertaking share buy backs very soon too.If I remember right  now that they are going into dividends start Dec22  there might be a lock-in period where they cannot do SBB (not 100% sure on this  do correct if wrong )It makes sense for price to maintain at $0.355 to $0.365 prior to Dividends record date and after that  expect some SBB action to come into play since they heads up that next quarter and full year will be a record high.Also  I won’t be surprised that a big special dividends to be announced. Seems like management in-line based on this report.Let’s go,btohqsg

US Stocks Pare Gains as Traders Await Policy Clues:Markets Wrap(Bloomberg) -- US stocks fluctuated as investors await the release of policy minutes from the Federal Reserve’s latest meeting for potential signs that the central bank may slow its pace of interest-rate hikes.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 trimmed earlier gains. Market trading volumes are expected to be lighter  given the US Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday.Treasuries pared the gains it notched after weaker-than-expected purchasing managers’ index readings for November.* A gauge of dollar strength dipped after data showed that US unemployment applications rose more than expected  in a sign of cooling in the labor market.* Oil fell as the European Union discussed imposing a price cap on Russian oil between $65 and $70 a barrel.The publication of minutes from the Fed’s Nov. 1-2 meeting -- due at 2 p.m. in Washington -- will be studied for how united policy makers were over a higher peak for interest rates than previously signaled in their fight against inflation.* However  since that meeting  investors have parsed a bevy of economic data that somewhat eased inflation concerns. That  along with recent rhetoric from Fed speakers  has made some investors anticipate the central bank will moderate its pace of rate hikes soon.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-stocks-poised-wall-street-225623233.html,btohqsg

🎉Pika World Daily Review – 24 November 2022🎉🎲FOMC meeting minutes: Slower rate hikes in perspective🗽Equity markets are encouraged by the Fed minutes which show a desire by many officials to start slowing down the pace of rate hikes in December. However  one should not see this as a form of dovish stance.🎯Some signs of inflation waning📊Some officials acknowledged early progress in inflation cooling  given more restrictive financial conditions. FOMC members are said to be taking into account the cumulative effect of the federal fund rates as part of the consideration in moderating their rate hike trajectory.🍏Commitment to price stability🧮The minutes continued to hammer the firm goal to pull the economy back to a 2% inflation level and are ready to tighten monetary conditions more than the initial plan if required to reach this goal. While some participants may feel that the Fed has been too aggressive  there is a general acknowledgement that more work is to be done to ensure progress is made.🍄More concrete signs before brake enforced💎While the minutes did show some divisive stances  with some officials ready to take the pedal off a rate hike  others cautioned against pre-mature moves to help ensure the economy is on track towards price stability.Some cautious and sometimes aggressive stances reflect the two camps in the Fed as they faced unknown external forces of events in driving inflation with their blunt tools in affecting aggregate demand rather than the supply side of the economy.Pika World remains vigilant on any call on Fed pivot as the overall minutes still reflect a balanced and hawkish stance.📮What's on the menu today?📖The market is closed today and will resume half-day trading on Friday.It is 24 November  Thursday  at 9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Pika World wishes everyone a restful day as we gear towards the final lap of trading for the week on Friday.,btohqsg
