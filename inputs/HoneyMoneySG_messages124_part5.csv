Ah sorry  wrong choice of words. Much better than the original credit card  100%. But cards like YouTrip or Trust in my experience is better. But I personally use Aspire for FX transactions now,btohqsg
(No need care about FX when your company is paying for you ðŸ˜‚),btohqsg
Yep Youtrip definitely has much more competitive FX rates compared to Amaze or Bank Credit Cards  but Youtrip sadly doesn't earn any rewards.Amaze allows you to earn normal credit card rewards  but in return you pay a FX Spread for their 'services'. This FX Spread (usually about 2.5% above Spot Rate) is still better than Bank Credit Card Spread which is usually about 4% above Spot Rate.So  as long as you can earn more than 2.5% benefit from your credit cards  using Amaze might still be superior to paying with Youtrip.,btohqsg
Yup! Perfectly summarised. Did you alr have this prepared? Haha hope you donâ€™t mind if I copy to send to my friends when they ask me next time. I will credit you,btohqsg
yeah! when company reimburses you  the best card in my opinion to use is UOB Visa Signature. You earn the full 4mpd while the company bears the 4% FX spread.,btohqsg
haha i am quite repetitive in my answers sometimes. Sure feel free to copy and paste and share.,btohqsg
Unfortunately need follow my company endorsed ones  but oh well better than nothing haha. Because of my position and BU  pretty much all of my FX and a good portion of local spends I just charge for company to reimburse haha. But I still need some hacks for my family spend. Too bad the Mari Card 5% Shopee is only a limited time thing. Hopefully they have smth like the Sheng Shiong card,btohqsg

Hmm... I am a bit out of my depth on this then I'm afraid... But generally speaking  business accounts have more favourable USD deposit terms  but of course business bank accounts have a lot more fees in general,btohqsg

How many times can you temporarily increase your credit limit for DBS credit cards? Can you do it every month?,btohqsg
Hi gurus  I'm looking to buy some jewelry from Tiffany & Co and looking to pay in-store. But weirdly Heymax says UOB PPV needs to pay online to get 4mpd and UOB Visa Signature only gives 0.4mpd. From my understanding  as long as we use contactless payment we can earn 4mpd for both cards? Will be great if anyone can confirm  thanks!,btohqsg
Old terms. Always refer to t&c.,btohqsg

Only spending in the DFI group  Grab or McD gives bonus Cashback dependent on hitting tier 1  2 or 3.,btohqsg
How about water or electricity bills? Does it also qualifies for the based 3.33%?,btohqsg
Does 3.33% means the $50 quarterly cashback?,btohqsg
For UOB one card  500min spend per month means the spending must be qualified retail spending..If I spend $300 on retail and the remaining $200 on insuranceDoes that means I wonâ€™t qualify for the quarterly cashback (as I did not hit the 500 min spend) BUT I will qualify for the One Account 500 card spend criteria?,btohqsg
