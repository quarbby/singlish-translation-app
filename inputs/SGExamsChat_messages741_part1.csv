Naur. U don’t read. U stare at the graph,btohqsg

Could be anyone then  this will need further investigation. But hais who must go so low as to use a burner number to bully someone. Clearly that person knows it’s wrong else he/she wouldn’t be using a burner number. Perhaps the person could be like someone from your sec or pri sch who bullied you last time  and he/she was lurking in this chat. Could also be possible that person found your sch and subject combi via other means and it has nothing to do with SGE.,btohqsg
Tbh after reading the top part again  it definitely sounds like someone who knows florals from sec sch,btohqsg
I’m more inclined to believe it isn’t from Rae but have no clue how that person found out about her sch and subject combi. Could be from SGE or some other sources.,btohqsg
It’s also possible that it’s not from a burner number at all. Florals could consider trying to save the contacts of everyone she has from her sec sch and see if the contact for this username eventually appears  but like also there’s still no guarantees this person is from her sec sch and isn’t using a burner number,btohqsg
Btw besides me did you find other ac geog students?,btohqsg
Can also dm other stuff you heard about ac geog if you don’t want say here,btohqsg
But anyway you don’t take geog so I doubt you know her,btohqsg
not me skipping two trains js to take the one that ends at kent ridge,btohqsg
Yeah but it could be someone from her sec sch that’s also inside sge  or that person heard about it from someone from sge,btohqsg
I rly don’t think Rae will go as long as getting a burner phone to do that  but also I think it’ll be hard to determine who unless police intervenes. Since nothing can be ruled out my advice to her would be to consider saving contacts of those she knows from Pri/sec sch (especially those who bullied her before),btohqsg
If the phone number of that username is saved tele will show,btohqsg
True but it may help if she rly wants to find out who the perpetrator is,btohqsg
Just swap it out on the same phone to get a new set up code,btohqsg
At least I think iPhone doesn’t for non US models,btohqsg
Now I recall in Japan my e SIM card also had a separate number and I could toggle between both,btohqsg
How you managed to find out more info about the other chers tho,btohqsg
