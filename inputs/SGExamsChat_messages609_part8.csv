not even a level standardâ€¦almost all sat math qns can be answered using o level e math contentâ€¦,btohqsg
the content wasnâ€™t horrible tbf. its like B to B+ material,btohqsg
if itâ€™s that sort of standard then im wondering how he got distinction,btohqsg
assignments are fairly easy to score for (or leech off others),btohqsg
and do decently for some finals,btohqsg
itâ€™s way easier in terms of rigour,btohqsg
you know i messed up my a levels and i got a very high score on it,btohqsg
Gr8 qn I got it from another simp chat,btohqsg
yeahâ€¦tbh not hard to get dist (gpa 4.00+) for less competitive courses. i was shocked at the number of modules that i have done better than expected when i checked my results on wed,btohqsg
iâ€™ve even done the GRE btw,btohqsg
the math isnâ€™t too hard even there,btohqsg
Kuro is this a girl or boy,btohqsg
plus for my course most finals are 50-60% weightage and a lot of people do bomb it,btohqsg
if youâ€™re ahead of the curve a bit youâ€™re good,btohqsg
the maths SAT has to be the biggest joke in the whole SAT exam,btohqsg
yeahâ€¦my finals all 50% this sem. i somehow got A for microecons even tho i felt i did not do well for the final but somehow other ppl bombed the final harder than me plus my CAs pulled me up,btohqsg
thing is in the US not everyone takes all the math,btohqsg
so itâ€™s hard for them to have like calculus or smth,btohqsg
itâ€™s honestly more close to like a basic aptitude test,btohqsg
like they take specific math classes,btohqsg
yeah i think a lot of ppl in us do APs (advanced placements) which is close to H2 level  but is uni year 1 stuff to them which they can choose to take in high school,btohqsg
everyone thatâ€™s gone through A levels wouldâ€™ve gone through pre calculus  calculus 1 and calculus 2,btohqsg
my best friend from the states she was y1 uni while i was teaching her limits in j1,btohqsg
calc 3 is where the typical jc student wouldnâ€™t know,btohqsg
i think Ibp is uni level stuff in us,btohqsg
Lol I tot I had u,btohqsg
itâ€™s ok bio major so not like sheâ€™s using it much,btohqsg
sheâ€™s studying to be a vet rn,btohqsg
think of it as SAT for postgrad admissions,btohqsg
funny both tjc and asrjc moving campus,btohqsg
tjc moving to tpjc old campusâ€¦very nice. literally mrt stn at doorstep,btohqsg
tpjc students themselves dont even get to use it for more than 2 months lol,btohqsg
rly want go asrjc since its like down the road for me,btohqsg
I wonder y haven't demolish yet,btohqsg
No need take mrt till bedok,btohqsg
the old ite bedok campus become lta office lol,btohqsg
but now need take mrt until tampines east,btohqsg
2 mrt stops away from expo,btohqsg
if u stay near tampines then good for you,btohqsg
Lol I live in tamp so okie,btohqsg
I still taking mrt to Bukit batok for MI,btohqsg
Maybe my future generations to come might enter ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
lol by then alr shift back liao,btohqsg
p much. and also p sure itâ€™s the subject test so its for people applying to postgrad programs that ask for a math GRE,btohqsg
oh yeahâ€¦actually dhs and vjc will benefit from tel4 opening most likely the first half this year. for those jae students concerned about travelling time.,btohqsg
Extension of Thomson east coast line,btohqsg
The 4th section that's being opened la,btohqsg
Thomson East Coast line phase 4,btohqsg
STUPID BROWN SHIT LINE FULL OF KSF ðŸ™„,btohqsg
yeahâ€¦but tbh tel4 dont really connect well to other mrt lines. only when tel5 opens in 2025 then it will be more convenient cause it connects to the eastern end of dtl,btohqsg
