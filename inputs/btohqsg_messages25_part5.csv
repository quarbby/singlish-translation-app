But i heard even if 1st timer low application  2nd timer is still capped at the amount hdb set,btohqsg
This is not true.For project with first timer application rate below 1  HDB has confirmed they will invite second timer to select.Also  it is confirmed by checking the take up rate for those projects with AR 0.1 - 0.3.,btohqsg
U must be very lucky then can get. Some 1st Timer try for 10 times also cannot get,btohqsg
Thanks! Possible to pin this message admin?,btohqsg
Does it mean that if those earlier q number first timer drop out  the next q number can be 2nd timer?,btohqsg
For exampleTanglin halt 3R BTOApplication rate for first timer 0.2First timer applicants: ~ 30First + second timer applicants: 85Total flats: 155 unitsFlats selected: 70 unitsIn this case  all second timer will get the queue number within the supplySome second timer may get better queue number if he is luckyOnly advantage first timer over second timer is first timer has 2 chances of ballot,btohqsg
Does anyone has an idea  if supply is 100units  queue number 1-100 will comprise of 95 first timers and 5 2nd timers?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the application rate for first timer?If application rate for first timer is above 1 then yea,btohqsg
If application rate for 1st timer is 2?,btohqsg
Then yea  it will be like this,btohqsg
So if application rate for 1st timer is less than 1  the queue 1 to 100 will be different composition?,btohqsg
YeaSecond timer will exceed 5% if not enough first timer,btohqsg
Sorry  only the owner can do it  and I'm not sure who the owner is,btohqsg
And what happens if/when you are within supply & you run out of ethnic quota?,btohqsg
So in essence  even if you are within supply  there's a possibility you may not have a chance? Damn.,btohqsg
yea which sucks becuse within supply is barred by the system from balloting for any upcoming projects  including oct one,btohqsg
But how legitimate is the information from the HDB rep?,btohqsg
only went to enquire because my q number is within supply but quite behind so there is a risk of running out of quota,btohqsg
Since there have been instances that different reps provide different responses.,btohqsg
yeap possible  but people have also  also heard of and reported such cases happening  albeit very very rare,btohqsg
The discussion here is that the MND information is inaccurate.,btohqsg
my prev ballot was within quota too and got called for booking appt. but 2 days bfre the day they cancelled bc exceeded quota limit for Malay ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
Hi....when is the next BTO or SBF blasting?,btohqsg
ultimately it‚Äôs all user-reported and one rep‚Äôs answer  we can only take it at face value,btohqsg
Yup  but I would think the printed response from MND should be... accurate haha.Now there's apparently a possibility it's not lol.,btohqsg
If ur queue no. is behind behind  hdb can exercise  flexibility  and allow u to apply for next launch  there were some people from Oct 23 launch invited to apply for Dec 23 even though they were in supply,btohqsg
ahhh okay  i was not aware of this! thank you so much for your input  will give it a shot!,btohqsg
But is HDB email them one,btohqsg
If hdb never email  then maybe system will still block it,btohqsg
But this exceptional case should be raised to hdb and waiver should be sought.I believe during the ballotting process the ethnic quota parameters have been applied so shouldnt have such cases?,btohqsg
will be checking with hdb as per what lyn mentioned  if whether a waiver can be givenas to cases of such a thing happening.. either people are falsely reporting or.. mnd‚Äôs info is just not accurate i guess. since hdb reps are not 100% accurate either  only the person that coded the balloting system will truly know.. hahah,btohqsg
Yes Hdb‚Äôs programmer should hve considered such edge cases from the start ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Is your queue number towards the tail-end of the supply?,btohqsg
Fuuuk so bad ah they all lol,btohqsg
yea  at this point of time can only hope enough people of the same race drop outor hoping that whatever MND reported is true.,btohqsg
Yeah spam his TikTok comment section,btohqsg
Or let's get Leong Mun Wai to do it üòÇ,btohqsg
Hoping for a good outcome for you ü§ûüèæ,btohqsg
Hi! May I know bukit batok's oct bto floor plan?,btohqsg
Floor plan isn't released yet. Think now they release it some time after results are out. So definitely not before the application period,btohqsg
Ok thanks not sure the 2nd type of 2 room is it new design which have extra bedroom or not.,btohqsg
Before the application window  they will release the site plan  which should show what room types there are including which 2R version they will have,btohqsg
Example of another launch's site plan@Susan197709,btohqsg
No  it‚Äôs based on the overall ethnic population. The formula must ask HDB or MND liao,btohqsg
I don't think they will give an actual ans to that üòÇ,btohqsg
Fair question leh. You try ask üòÅ,btohqsg
Ya similar but this is 2010 lolol,btohqsg
The society is made up of three main ethnic groups: Chinese (74%)  Malays (13%)  and Indians (9%) 2020 statistics.https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/cop2020/sr1/findings.pdf,btohqsg
