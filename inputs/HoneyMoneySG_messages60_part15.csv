"Lowest between 10k and 9k is 9k üôÉ all jokes aside  just read what cpf website states. The ""lowest amount"" thing isn't even from them and is just what people assume.==========Let me copy again in case you missed:Anything credited will only start earning interest in next month.Anything debited will not earn interest in the month itself.We just use your 2 cases  either case is the same.Interest for this month computed with: 9kInterest for next month computed with (before any debits): 11k",btohqsg
If I remember correctly  someone email CPF this 2 cases but I forgot what is the answer. Let me search if can find it.,btohqsg
Sure  please share if you can find the answer. üëçüèª It should not be different from what their website states but if it is then they need to clarify on their siteConsidering CPF updated the website info in Oct 22  if the email is before that  it might be unreliable already,btohqsg
NOWWhat is the best credit card for hawker and bus/mrt ?,btohqsg
The description is clear. Interest is affected by transactions  not by balance or whatever minimum amount. If you deposit $10 and withdraw $10  a total of $20 will not earn any thing for the whole month,btohqsg

Finally found the answer. There were 2 replies from CPF. One in Sep 2017  one in Oct 2022. Both replies seem to indicate CPF is using the 'lowest amount' of the month to calculate the interest. In other words the sequence of Top up and deduction to CPF matters.CPF reply on Sep 2017:******************************************Thank you for your email of 3 September 2017.Yes  your CPF interest is computed monthly. It is then credited and compounded to your account balances yearly.You can refer to the following formula to compute interest:Monthly interest earned = [Monthly eligible balance* x interest rate per annum] √∑ 12 months*The following three illustrations show how the monthly eligible balance is derived.Illustration 1 ‚Äì Only deduction transaction takes place in the monthAmountMonth Beginning Balance $2 000.00Deduction $50.00___Month Ending Balance $1 950.00In illustration 1  the eligible monthly balance used to compute interest is $1 950.00.Illustration 2 ‚Äì Deduction transaction occurs after contribution transactionAmountMonth Beginning Balance $2 000.00Contribution $500.00Deduction $50.00____Month Ending Balance $2 450.00In illustration 2  the eligible monthly balance used to compute interest is $2 000.00.As the deduction of $50 occurred after the $500 contribution was credited to the account  this deduction did not impact the eligible monthly balance used for interest computation  and thus  interest is computed based on $2 000.00.Illustration 3 ‚Äì Deduction occurs before a contribution in the monthAmountMonth Beginning Balance $2 000.00Deduction $50.00Contribution $500.00___Month Ending Balance $2 450.00In illustration 3  the eligible monthly balance used to compute interest is $1 950.00.*******************************************CPF reply in Oct 2022:*******************************************Dear XXX We refer to your request of 4 Oct 2022.The CPF balances used for interest computation are affected by the transactions in your account.In the event that there is a contribution (including refunds) before a withdrawal/deduction this month  the CPF balance used for interest computation ismaximized for the benefit of CPF membersthrough the following:The deduction is first made using contributions received before the deduction (since the contributions received this month start earning interest next month)Any remaining amount to be deducted is made from the balance in the beginning of the month.The deduction will be made using the balance in the beginning of the month if there is no contribution received before the deduction.I would be pleased to help if you require further assistance. For more information on CPF  please visitcpf.gov.sg.**************************************************,btohqsg
Based on CPF's reply  for the 2 cases I gave Case 1 amount to be eligible for interest should be 9K.Case 2 amount to be eligible for interest should be 10K.,btohqsg

Hi  for the recent youtube video by honey money.I am kind of confused  why Kris+ is different from ShopBack and Fave when use with Citibank Rewards Master card?Anyone can share and explain?,btohqsg
shopback and fave is charged directly to card but Kris+ use mobile wallet IE apple pay or Gpay. It Payment Method is different.Also on shopback you must use the enter CC detail method and not pay via mobile wallet.Enter CC details are generally online transactionshopback and fave is method as online paymentKris+ is mobile walletMobile Wallet Payment is excluded on Citibank Reward Mastercard for eligible reward spend,btohqsg
Yeah  I think it is a mistake in the video. CRMC mobile Wallet exclusion is not because  of Kris+  but because of Google Pay/Apple Pay.Shopback pay/ Fave pay can directly link with CRMC because you enter your CRMC credit card details in the app  not going to GPay/Apple Pay  so no exclusion.But if Kris+ pay with google pay+ CRMC  CRMC is directly used with Google Pay  so hit the exclusion.But if Kirs+ Pay with Google Pay + Amaze + CRMC  CRMC is directly used with Amaze and not Google pay  so no exclusion.,btohqsg

Edwin mention that Google pay will not count as online payment. because Xnap and kris+ app both using Google pay. so it suppose online or not count at all,btohqsg
