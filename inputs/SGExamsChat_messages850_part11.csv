Till date india has banned 220 apps in the last 5 years  alot of chinese linked apps,btohqsg
When titkok was banned in india  they issued a appstore/gamestore wide banned on these apps as well,btohqsg
Is there any information that tiktok might want to host a web hidden service ? Facebook has a tor hidden service ....,btohqsg
xhs  weibo  a lot of social media used in china has this feature,btohqsg
dark web is banned in china,btohqsg
This gonna create a lot of problems for ppl with tik tok acc,btohqsg
Nah I use have my US SIM card in here on standby,btohqsg

"pov : chinese netizens roast the ""migrators"" in the comment section",btohqsg
they come to xhs as tik tok refugees,btohqsg
and the ppl who migrate over can't understand the comment sections,btohqsg
my xhs flooded with tik tok refugees feed üíÄ,btohqsg
worse is some of them become racist on the app,btohqsg
i just click ignore / remove the ENGLISH ONLY posts,btohqsg
that means they're out of my algorithm,btohqsg
i don't mind those that add both english & chinese subtitles,btohqsg
essentially  a TikTok that's even more Chinese,btohqsg
"Funnily enough the justification for TikTok's ban was its ""links to China"".",btohqsg
Yet people are moving to certain apps despite their much stronger relations to China,btohqsg
Xhs official English name is red note,btohqsg
oh yea btw apparently  its not only the US and the ban may spread to other US allies but unlikely tho,btohqsg
tiktok ban is a western thing,btohqsg
yea  india's one was more than just tiktok tho..they had physical conflicts with chinese personell..that could have contributed to it,btohqsg
they ban tiktok but not guns????,btohqsg
i never understood what the US actually means..when they create these vehicles for china,btohqsg
USA gun law is limited by constitution btw,btohqsg
well now trump says hes gonna save tiktok,btohqsg
when he was all on banning it in the first place,btohqsg
all the tariffs on china..and yet here they are creating authoritrative vehicles for china...like they are playing both sides of a coin,btohqsg
The reason why their gun law is so ridiculously relaxed is to do with historical reason,btohqsg
if you look at trends  after every mass shooting. more gun laws which enables more people to get guns are put into effect than laws preventing more guns,btohqsg
Yup coz prevent guns requirements constitutional ammendments and US constitutional structure is very difficult to change,btohqsg
You have to understand that lobby groups are in power too and USA was founded in 1776   back then US relied on militia to run their war machinery   hence they granted gun rights to ppl at constitutional level,btohqsg
This seems outdated as since then,btohqsg
US already have an army already,btohqsg
the Us is one of those pandora box's ahh country,btohqsg
remove the army again then üòÅ,btohqsg
you say US Allies so i thought Singapore too,btohqsg

But we get military stuff from mostly US though üòÖüòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Our F15 and F16 aircraft came from there,btohqsg
Something like how swiss operate with neutrality  in fact the Swiss has military equipment from Western countries too.,btohqsg
Like their F/A 18 jets come from US too,btohqsg
Countries have to side with each other lol,btohqsg
They just become desperate during emergencies and wartimes.,btohqsg
