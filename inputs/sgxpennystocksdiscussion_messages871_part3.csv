"🚀Pika World Markets Update - 14 Dec 2023🚀Happily Ever After.💰That tagline speaks volumes about the current market condition. Uncle Powell's FOMC press conference was seen as a dovish act. Even before this  the Summary of Economic Projections (which we have stressed enormously) is critical to the market movement.🥁Upon the release  if you had seen our guidance  you would have caught the first wave and profited from the ride. The projection shows that the Fed could cut the rate three times next year  up from 2 in the previous forecast. This is seen as a ""pivot"" by many investors  though Uncle Powell stopped the call for a win in the battle against inflation.With this dovish stance comes the animal spirit of the market. The future markets are running ahead of the Fed. They expect six rate cuts in 2024  up from 4 in earlier forecasts.🍏What further drove the market upward was one question raised on whether the Fed would cut the rate when the inflation hits 2%. Uncle Powell stated that the central bank would likely cut the rate even before it hits the goal and not overshoot the target. This is the dance of the day that markets wanted to hear. And they reflected in major indices roaring ahead  with the Dow Jones Industrial Index hitting above 37 000 for the first time.🎢Still  amid all the rosy outlook  let us dive into another camp. Any upside surprises in GDP growth could also derail the pace of rate cuts. Uncle Powell had spoken some thoughts on this. His idea is that robust economic growth is satisfactory. Nonetheless  it could make it harder for the central bank to hit the 2% goal. So that means the Fed may have to keep the rate for longer if the economy materially reboots its engine.Hence  he is moving carefully with the Fed committee to assess the totality of the actions taken on the monetary tightening front through interest rate policy and the balance sheet runoff in the background.📪What's on the menu today?🗽At 9.30 pm  prepare for the release of Core Retail Sales  which is expected to grow by 0.1%  a similar rate as before. This will delight investors that the economy is still steady  with consumer spending remaining healthy to achieve a soft landing and a cooling inflation environment  both attributed to the goldilocks melody for the equity market.It is 14 Dec  Thursday  9 am in Singapore and 9 pm in New York. Congrats to those who have profited from our trade room call analysis. Do be cautious  as the market is in the overbought territory zone for the short term.Cheers Pika Nat.🧃",btohqsg
