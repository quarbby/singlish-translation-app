a lvl is quite heavy on ethics for bio,btohqsg

2/3 of the h2 bio syllabus actually prepares one for a pre-med course in university,btohqsg

And u still have to serve bond,btohqsg
I heard that the average RP of a medical school student in university,btohqsg
After u complete local medical course  u must serve bond,btohqsg
If ure rich just go overseas,btohqsg
as alot of stuff in medi boils down to practise and experience,btohqsg
Chemistry and biology for a levels,btohqsg

The course is shorter and u get to practise anywhere in the world,btohqsg
not even counting living costs etc,btohqsg
Oh. Ok then do it locally then,btohqsg

I mean unless you got a scholarship,btohqsg
idk man i nvr rly tot of studying med overseas,btohqsg
ik ppl with 90rp and still nvr get into med,btohqsg
Uhh there’s only one non-bonded overseas scholarship,btohqsg
its not insanely difficult but more of whether you're suitable,btohqsg
cuz the interview is a killer,btohqsg
Rich then go study overseas lah,btohqsg

damn i didnt know LaQuita Granger was a doctor,btohqsg
Hwa Chong’s medical program is really good,btohqsg
But at the same time it’s Hwa Chong so need to study the medical stuff with the higher chinese stuff,btohqsg
I see no point in getting a scholarship honestly,btohqsg
Most of them have ridiculous bonds and requirements,btohqsg
But you need to maintain a certain GPA,btohqsg
Otherwise the scholarship will drop you,btohqsg
Ya that’s why I’m uninterested in getting one,btohqsg
I want to spend university playing,btohqsg
Just get a degree the go work,btohqsg
Not everyone can be summa cum laude,btohqsg
