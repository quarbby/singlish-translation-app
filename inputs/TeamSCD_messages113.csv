I the st bro the white c200 hahaha,btohqsg
420i GC or GLC250 SUV  which shld i change to? Hah,btohqsg
my dad used to drive a 420i GC,btohqsg
i think the drive is ok-ish,btohqsg
generally sedan driving feel is better than SUV,btohqsg
ya lor both are totally different types of car,btohqsg
to me it‚Äôs a good car. but i‚Äôve never experienced the GLC250,btohqsg
the looks of 420i GC is really nice lah... but GLC more practical,btohqsg
but my dad sold off the 420iGC alr  drove it i think for 6-7yeard,btohqsg
i mean is it the typical BMW (no offence to BMW drivers) haha,btohqsg
good  just have to do some wear and tear,btohqsg
F series is nice la. but i feel 4 series should be kept as a coupe.,btohqsg
if want sedan  should go for 3 series,btohqsg
wanted to try a diff car but dun wanna go for first hand right now,btohqsg
before my dad sold off the car  there weren‚Äôt any problems with the car,btohqsg
just replacement of those normal wear & tear stuff lo,btohqsg
but my dad rarely drives it.. so the mileage is quite low also,btohqsg
if like to mod  420 also better choice,btohqsg
but if wna change exhaust  must buy the correct one also. cos from what ik the 428 n 420 exhaust diff despite using the same N20 engine,btohqsg
think cause it relates to something with the exhaust valve from what the workshop said when my dad wanted to dekit the exhaust to sell to someone whom was driving a 428.,btohqsg
but air intake all those is fine,btohqsg
haha now my dealer told me they just eat in glc coupe within my budget,btohqsg
if all good thats my first choice lol,btohqsg
my dad also looking at glc to replace his current merc  but only looking for GLC250d üòÇ,btohqsg
im not familiar with diesel engine,btohqsg
now currently driving a eclass diesel,btohqsg
you mean you never noticed lol,btohqsg
Diesel engines are good for daily,btohqsg
actually i like the old toyota crown taxi,btohqsg
You top up the tank with vegetable oil also can,btohqsg
japan still using them till this day,btohqsg
Toyota alot of nice cars with manual overseas not available in sg,btohqsg
all these with manual cfm damn nice,btohqsg
hahah u try let me know what happen next leh haha,btohqsg
Alot of ppl try on youtube,btohqsg
They said diesel and vege oil is not much diff,btohqsg
infact vege oil is cleaner den diesel,btohqsg
This fella run on oil vege oil,btohqsg
you use new one cfm bodaiji,btohqsg
this feller always good to watch,btohqsg
But from what i heard is they made diesel engines to run on vegeoil in the early years,btohqsg
those angmor they say their farm tractors also run on vegeoil,btohqsg
and dont really care if the engine dies,btohqsg
but the engines probably got different requirements,btohqsg
just like how some engines need 98  some 92 no problem,btohqsg
but diesel only 1 grade ma,btohqsg
I very keen to try on my company lorry,btohqsg
not really  that day heard got different grade,btohqsg
idk will tio gan by my boss or not,btohqsg
because we were having issues with our generators,btohqsg
i assume is those euro grades or something,btohqsg
js say u feeling generous   u help to pump diesel,btohqsg
half tank diesel half tank oil,btohqsg
I'm trying to help coy save money,btohqsg
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable_oil_fuelKnn there's actually a whole wiki page talking about vegetable oil as fuel,btohqsg
The other one quotes me $250 include wash throttle body,btohqsg

Lemme go see how many 535 selling under 523 in sgcarmart,btohqsg
I meannnn looks wise ü§£ but if they use that thennnnnnnnüò™,btohqsg
Has anyone done grounding to their carü§î,btohqsg
This one I cannot advise you,btohqsg
some say is when you have alot of electronics then got use,btohqsg
I rather not play with electronics. Now many car catching on fire,btohqsg
I cannot see the link why electronics will affect your engine stuff,btohqsg
one is electronic 1 is mechanical,btohqsg
Maybe too much stress for the ECU? Idk,btohqsg
I guess its the battery pump to compressor that part there,btohqsg
Idkkkk i give up with my acceleration,btohqsg
One say this one say that i dont even know the issue,btohqsg
computer output is fixed one. They tell your engine do what  then it do what,btohqsg
you give more volts you only fry the ECU,btohqsg
you give less volts  the ECU will just cease to work,btohqsg
My battery dying anytime soon its at 11.9 volts sometimes,btohqsg
i think your electronics somewhere got cock up,btohqsg
But that time i bring to honda the guy say its not healthy so yep,btohqsg
Thays the issue with cars nowadays dk where which electronics,btohqsg
You didn't install any werid stuff right,btohqsg
like speakers and subs or weird lights,btohqsg
Other than lufi and phone charger nope,btohqsg
then it shouldn't be a problem,btohqsg
But like those acceleration and all?,btohqsg
The only link is if not properly ground and u have a power leak then more hp is being diverted to your alternator to handle the false ‚Äúload‚Äù. This eats into your engine performance.,btohqsg
Electronics pull from alternator while alternator pulls from engine  which is why ppl turn off aircon when tracking,btohqsg
I personally think la  unless you have electronics mod.,btohqsg
all the grounding and VSD is not necessary,btohqsg
Imo this is for vehicle with highly varying electrical load,btohqsg
their boot open inside got 1 claw machine you also wont be surprised,btohqsg
Or open inside got TV and PS4,btohqsg
All the power needs to come from somwhere,btohqsg
but i think if it's stock and needed  the engineers would have done something one,btohqsg
Like slap on a bigger battery or alternator or something,btohqsg
Remind him to renew roadtax oso,btohqsg
i think at some point everyone cfm same one,btohqsg
your a class was scrapped? or sold,btohqsg
cos i see so many no swap required,btohqsg
means you kept your stock stuff ah,btohqsg
mods will never earn or break even,btohqsg
My car idling in traffic very long sia,btohqsg
But i off aircon instant so quiet,btohqsg
But i think those carburettor engine abit too old,btohqsg
I think my car is still on electronic TB,btohqsg
parts also dk can find or not,btohqsg
and they dont make much power,btohqsg
i still miss those manual windows car,btohqsg
The cars i sit in army dont even have doors and windshield,btohqsg
Damn funny leh people waiting to talk to you u take your time to wind down the windowüò≠ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Delete power steering no need go gym,btohqsg
Do it... It helps maintaining voltage,btohqsg
wanted to say gym membership expensive ah,btohqsg
cos my hydraulic steering starting to have signs of age,btohqsg
U want the most savings  best FC  no headache never ever go ws,btohqsg
push the car around and turn steering wheel,btohqsg
I love the rx8 but i will not tell u have savings or no headache,btohqsg
i still got go malaysia one,btohqsg
@PilotAviator21haha but your grounding is to improve accleration...?,btohqsg
How much did u do grounding?,btohqsg
but they wont cut if they wanna steal car,btohqsg
they cut if they see inside got laptops or tablets,btohqsg
I did for mine  my voltage previously would drop to 10+ after changing the grounds it always stayed above 11v,btohqsg
Huh mine he quote me 140,btohqsg
Wow but i need change my battery too,btohqsg
Next time meet got alex i dowan come alr,btohqsg
You can try going to GT Auto... Should be Abt $100 or so,btohqsg
sepang that trip need park overnight,btohqsg
Mine I ordered the hybrid racing k20 grounding kit then ask my workshop install,btohqsg
Dk the hotel or airbnb will have a lot of ppl or not ma,btohqsg
Bonnet and wing both next week push back push back ü•≤,btohqsg
I going with my friend too,btohqsg
but you staying in KL how long,btohqsg
our itinerary only got tofu shop and RWB museum,btohqsg
Yea they probably break window as usual. Window cheap,btohqsg
and maybe touge run here and there,btohqsg
This one can adjust one ma,btohqsg
Outside my house got new bto,btohqsg
The road is like a fucking teenager face,btohqsg
Tear abd patch  tear and patch  never do properly,btohqsg
I changed to bilstein b6. Before was tein flex z,btohqsg
Lay cable and pipe i understand. Do liao can patch properly one,btohqsg
But no they patch liao machiam one speed bump,btohqsg
And is a longitudinal speed bump,btohqsg
My house outside now look like suspension kit test course,btohqsg
To me simple. Either stock and nonstress about most humps. Or all out air sus,btohqsg
Slammed when parked  suv height in carparks,btohqsg
Some stock height cannot la hahah,btohqsg
This is the greatest lie ever told,btohqsg
Yea rx8 stock height is fine,btohqsg
Maybe that height can hook gutter and corner,btohqsg
U intend to have kids not,btohqsg
Fit/jazz is like a mini van,btohqsg
Pls get the miata that can blink and wink,btohqsg
But if you get a miata,btohqsg
you daily wont be the miata,btohqsg
Bonnet yst the putty dry then they spray then panels,btohqsg
I alr planning to find daily alr,btohqsg
once it happens it's sit workshop 1 week + liao,btohqsg
everytime it rains i get anxiety,btohqsg
i scare go into my car find puddles,btohqsg
as long as is convertible  you have more seals,btohqsg
I'm still dailying my miata la,btohqsg
until i can afford money for a daily,btohqsg
at this point i dont even care what car it is liao. cos i alr have a miata,btohqsg
just a normal car can alr,btohqsg
You need to be to have a 2nd car,btohqsg
like if you can own 1 evo,btohqsg
that one alr price of 2 cars,btohqsg
That one is because you made it that way üòÇ,btohqsg
i sat in TT's rear seats before,btohqsg
But the mx5 got reason to need a 2nd car,btohqsg
Anyone interested in car care product or PPF can pm me for details,btohqsg
I'd take an evo9 any day,btohqsg
I just can't pay for one,btohqsg
i have always been a STI > Evo guy,btohqsg
But for a daily shit box  just a vios should be fine,btohqsg
So even if i have money  i'd go subie,btohqsg
i want a daily shitbox so i can claim ppl accident,btohqsg
Blue one box wagon was just across us yesterday,btohqsg
those that cut into my lane without checking,btohqsg
those that drive in opposite direction  i just headon bang,btohqsg
i think 2 years back WRX was 6 to 8k depre,btohqsg
there was a 1 owner unit,btohqsg
I just sad i can't afford,btohqsg
I had the option to go for the hatch back sti over the euro r,btohqsg
But the inside really too plastic,btohqsg
but 2.0 is the engine you want,btohqsg
in japan their STI all 2.0,btohqsg
I like all of them la,btohqsg
The only reason why i like the levorg,btohqsg
Hatch easy to put things in the boot,btohqsg
Even if no more seats for a person  can put in the boot,btohqsg
Which is why i dont like hatch. The things in the boot is still in your cabin,btohqsg
technically sedan boot is still in your cabin  but it's more isolated,btohqsg
I dont like to see in rear view mirror thencan see my boot stuff,btohqsg
makes me feel like i driving lorry,btohqsg
I don't like to see ppl in my rear view mirror,btohqsg
Especially idiots who sit in the middle,btohqsg
I driving a mini van aka hatchback...but no issues with downforce at 170kmph...not sure wad speed u usually going atüòÇ,btohqsg
that's why you need a miata,btohqsg
2.0 can hold more hp n boost,btohqsg
So by right the hawkeye auto WRX is a jem,btohqsg
I like to sit in middle hehe,btohqsg
but need to swap the trans,btohqsg
But I always throw all my barang barang in the back seat,btohqsg
You so small might not even see you,btohqsg
I sit at the sides i will puke,btohqsg
Do you guys have walkies? Like when drive together can talk,btohqsg
I think end of the day..daily shld be reliable and comfortableüòÅ,btohqsg
The baofeng is amazing... I could use it to scan for the frequency my other walkie is using,btohqsg
next time can have dedicated channel or frequency,btohqsg
But frequency range wise not that far,btohqsg
He photographer mah so to communicate for rolling shots panic shots all he will use it,btohqsg
i had to scan the frequency then the dcs to get it to work with my other walkie,btohqsg
All bring your car to me ill take out the battery for better performanceüëç,btohqsg
Best no one ever buys one of these non display kind,btohqsg
mine is the no display one,btohqsg
ndp don't use these kind of nonsense lol,btohqsg
you learn how to take out your air filter first,btohqsg
ndp all using ridel com's system,btohqsg
then must sit down one day with you to figure out your frequency,btohqsg
Miata can daily just dont get a soft top ‚Äî,btohqsg
at least for show segment all using ridel,btohqsg
Lai who at jurong want lUnch,btohqsg
if it's the fixed hard top  it's not a miata :(,btohqsg
Very easy one la. just 1 clamp,btohqsg
i want lunch but i in aljunied,btohqsg
My diy will be paper cone there,btohqsg
not true  the other one i had to use dcs,btohqsg
when i found the frequency  i could receive but couldn't transmit on the UV-5R,btohqsg
until i searched for the DCS frequency  similar to the cts,btohqsg
had to watch youtube to figure out,btohqsg
later i need go site already,btohqsg
what time  need to shower first,btohqsg
Wah shower still at home shiok,btohqsg
looks like bo bian make noodles,btohqsg
Shopee idk real or fake also,btohqsg
then again it's all from china,btohqsg
the 5W version i think can even play radio,btohqsg
If f1 drivers can we canü§£ü§£ü§£ü§™,btohqsg
this more for drives to malaysia,btohqsg
i can't read chinese so i use aliexpress lol,btohqsg
I thought we got the zelo app,btohqsg
can only talk to china girls in chinese,btohqsg
later police stop you for using phone,btohqsg
then yours might just work in channel mode,btohqsg
Cos can buy same model and still connect same channel,btohqsg
My friend have like 6 or 7 of it,btohqsg
Where got all drive 1 hand,btohqsg
Oh wait u all manual oops sorry sorry,btohqsg
I one leg one 2 handü§£,btohqsg
Yep saw that big and clear,btohqsg
I need to put fake men use 2 pedalsü§≠ü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
I happy alr i not the only one,btohqsg
I also dont wanna know how,btohqsg
Real men dont need a stick to prove masculinity,btohqsg
Got stick doesnt mean is men,btohqsg
No stick doesnt mean is women,btohqsg
Dun venture too often to land of smilesüòÇ,btohqsg
Sorry furthest i drive is JB,btohqsg
this one i rather not know,btohqsg
Take plane la...drive to there...balls oso turn purple,btohqsg
More like hold u guys back,btohqsg
But i heard also VAG makes bad manual boxes,btohqsg
Alot of people i know that say feels very disconnected. The manual gb,btohqsg
takes the fun out of it,btohqsg
The burning man video  I've been thinking how is it that scdf is already there when he runs out,btohqsg
Probably scdf nearby for inspection or something,btohqsg
Hearsay is he tried to put out the fire,btohqsg
Like there must have been the fire for a while for scdf to even arrive,btohqsg
then the fire just grew too big too fast,btohqsg
But idk why he nv stop drop roll,btohqsg
It looked like all of him was on fire,btohqsg
another reminder to buy fire extinguisher guys,btohqsg
Car fire like very common nowadays,btohqsg
Ya sia i need get one soon,btohqsg
Coolant how often do u guys top up?,btohqsg
They actually sell something you install on your bonnet  when there's a fire it does it thing,btohqsg
Oh okay so let workshop do it everytime,btohqsg
heard of it before. race cars all have one,btohqsg
personally for me  it helped with idle and general drivability. but mine is old car lah  the starlet which is carbureted. for 1 year plus we drove it thinking got issues with the carburetor cos it idles badly and falls flat on its face if u give throttle but after fixing the grounding all ok le... my guess is smth to do with the spark plugs since that car not much electronics but not too sure... just happy its more drivable ü§£,btohqsg
Aiya when leave car at honda on sat ask them check all the issues liao,btohqsg
Previous owner dk how many years nv change,btohqsg
Okayy cause last time like 2 months ago raymond top it up for me randomly not durinf servicing,btohqsg
Actually you need to tell them what's wrong,btohqsg
Workshops can only see externally if something is wrong,btohqsg
Well i explained about my acceleration issue they say its normal,btohqsg
But workshops and people say not,btohqsg
The one at low rpm got this static noise when accelerate around 30 km/hr ish,btohqsg
One say battery one say aircon one say normal one say de carbon it,btohqsg
So idk which one it is,btohqsg
Its like a dragging noise along with the rpm,btohqsg
Better if u in the car,btohqsg
Or any audio device charging from the car,btohqsg
Aiya nxt time u guys see,btohqsg
No leh but its always at 1.4 rpm ish only after that 2rpm 3 rpm 4 rpm all normal,btohqsg
Like at that certain rpm it will have that draggy electric noise,btohqsg
Annoying thej it will just jump to gear 2,btohqsg
I had static sound in my previous car  but it was because I was charging the Bluetooth transmitter from the car,btohqsg
but my friend's GK3 CVT died ard 90km also,btohqsg
hers is the gearbox just doesnt engage,btohqsg
For a moment I thought you calling@PilotAviator21a her,btohqsg
CVT aren't supposed to piang also,btohqsg
