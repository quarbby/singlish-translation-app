Same with me. Since I'm contractor myself it is even easier.,btohqsg
The 3rm current design quite bad though. Specifically the ceiling.,btohqsg
Yea but between the 2 choices that you posted  the 3 room one seemed like alot of work,btohqsg
Plan to hack kitchen/living room partition wall,btohqsg

Getting a resale  confirmed a flat with seller. Is it very tedious to do on my own vs engaging an agent? Seller has their agent whereas I don't.,btohqsg
How much is the commission if I engage one? 1%?,btohqsg
Normally seller agent will also help you. They need to close the sales also but it is not difficult at all. Pm me if you need help  I did mine without agent too.,btohqsg
Thanks someone  else offered help me. If I need help will let u know.,btohqsg
It’s really damn easy. Hdb website has lots of guides,btohqsg
Seller agent scared me a little. Say until have alot of things,btohqsg
😏Not a lot. Step by step guides  easy to follow.,btohqsg
