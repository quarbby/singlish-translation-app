To see so many fellow retailers currently stucked at high of any medical / glove counters is quite saddening. You have to spot early at initial stage of the move. If miss  not necessary to force chase. Chasing mentality very risky. Should always wait for a better time to enter after retrace or when it‚Äôs trading at an ‚Äòarea of value‚ÄôJust sharing an example of@rczsjjsearly research on Vicplas ($0.13x) to look for potential counter at early stage by spotting activity . Instead of trying to defend your vested stocks or talking it up (which is pointless as retailers can really only move a stock price by tiny bit) . If it moves  it moves.Being stucked is unnecessary too if you guys practice proper SL. Honestly  all this can be avoided. If you think trading is to make easy money or get rich quick  I believe this will only get you in more money problems.,btohqsg
anyone here vested into VICPLAS (569) ?,btohqsg
got any insight? just found that they do medical supplies and maybe might be relevant with the covid19 play after the vaccine is out.,btohqsg
Close to the 5 year high. Very Low liquidity though. Fundamentals quite okay.,btohqsg
thanks! need to do more homework,btohqsg
Not vested yet. Just doing some homework over weekends   but seems like a buy for me. Their next financial report is in Sept. so i think got time to go in.,btohqsg
Nice do share with us your research bro üëç,btohqsg
Hey bro  any research you did for Vicplas ?,btohqsg
Vicplas is the main company. they have this 100% owned subsidiary called Forefront Medical. Apparently  given this covid19 situation  they are dealing with Diagnostic devices. This forefront medical is one of 4 companies under the sg government to mass produce those test kits/swab.,btohqsg
Thanks man. For Vicplas  News was out 13th July  price was about $0.113 then. Now moved to about $0.138. If retrace  I might consider joining in. Any further news is catalyst for move.HeySoon Guan (SG Yuan - Elliot Wave) Share Junctioncan share your chart for  Vicplas ? Thanks üôèüèª,btohqsg

Show of faith by tang tang to bePutting in millions of her own $ to buy from open market.When Uncle Sam buying at 20 cent region she pays almost 40% higherA prime takeover candidate but surely no deal in near future or she will be accused of insider trading as she is ED and husband is chairman.,btohqsg
Is there any stipulated time frame that insiders cannot buy if they have knowledge of a possible offer coming ?,btohqsg
Hmm  good to know bro.Always had that thought that it had this possibility when bought it earlier on  along with it being quite undervalued and CB groceries demand,btohqsg
Can any kind soul add me to MT grpüôè thanks alot,btohqsg
If they make offer  what price u reckon they might make ? Uncle Sam likely form part of that consortium to take it private too I reckon.,btohqsg
If sam not part of consortium he won‚Äôt let go cheap,btohqsg
He always got special liking for food counters,btohqsg
Another candidate will be jb food,btohqsg
$0.49 quite steep. They surly wanna buy cheap though,btohqsg
Yea man  was he part of the team who took Super coffee private ?,btohqsg
May seem high but absolute amount needed to buy those outside their handsProbably the cash within is sufficient already,btohqsg
No he was part of those who sold out,btohqsg

Cash cow in the making.Hydroelectric disposal will be idealDisinfectant is pointless. Maybe help pay some salaryAutomation is key business but hard to give forecast like aem style due to diverse customer baseCeo is an expensive position. Controlling shareholder treating company as Atm. Like metro styleStill baffling why NT dispose off small position. Was hoping they will add on to counter ceo family business styleMany write ups on isdn recently due to share price surgeSomething I am holding in cpf for long term. If that‚Äôs any sign of confidence. Taking scrips all these years,btohqsg
For example superA third party comes and take everythingBillion dollar is big thing here but to PE and Industry mammoths that is small change. I want means I want,btohqsg
