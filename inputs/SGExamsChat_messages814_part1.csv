If that person is 55 yo by then  he/she has an option not to be rotated,btohqsg

Will that mean they will be forced to go all ard singapore coz for instance jcs  are so scattered,btohqsg

The plan on how the rotation is to be done isn‚Äôt fixed yetThere are suggestions that rotation to be done within a clusterIn any case  I know of school leaders who stay all over Sg and are posted all over Sg too,btohqsg

"Have you heard of the ""grey rock"" method? There's a theory that if you adopt the qualities of a stone  becoming impassive and bland  you will repel the argumentative  antagonistic people in your life who are itching for conflict.Here's how it works:https://cna.asia/4cnSxUb",btohqsg
Sec 4 in china is È´ò‰∏Äalrd,btohqsg
ip is more advanced than Sec school  iirc,btohqsg
