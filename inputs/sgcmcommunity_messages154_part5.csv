Can't really judge owner count well at times,btohqsg
Some cars have higher owner count because of plate changes and thus increased ownership transfers,btohqsg
Instead of paper transfer count look at the car condition closely instead,btohqsg
And if it has maintenance history,btohqsg
Sometimes the benefit with 1 or 2 owner cars is that you can get all the service records,btohqsg
6.2l V8 for me instead please,btohqsg
And got one kor kor say to me “there’s no replacement for displacement”,btohqsg
