it's causing prices of used cars to go up also,btohqsg
Happy to see the prices climb steadily ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So unless you sell and forget about buying cars,btohqsg
At the end of the day youâ€™ll end up with a ridiculously overpriced car,btohqsg
It's also the cause of COE prices to go up ma,btohqsg
COE price up you cfm affected,btohqsg
And if youâ€™re just a budget high loan owner that cannot keep long term,btohqsg
Good luck selling in the future,btohqsg
As used car prices go up in the market  people rather buy new cars. Causing higher demand. Not to mention such JDM cars also need to renew COE.,btohqsg
