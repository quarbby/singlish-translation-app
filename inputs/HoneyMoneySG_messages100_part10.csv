"Happy birthday!How do you feel about getting $1.1k below their illustrated projected benefit of 5% p.a.? 🌚It does look like it's generating about 4% p.a. still.I think you lost a bit from the 4% extra ""fee"" for paying monthly.",btohqsg
CardUp + eligible miles/cashback credit cards (preferably Visa for 1.75% fee promo) or HSBC EGA GIRO.,btohqsg
What is the difference between the then projected value 25 years ago and actual value now? Did they achieve what they projected?,btohqsg
Thanks for this as well. So if only plan to do the top up as of May 1st  I can register now and wait till April 30 to top up ya,btohqsg
I’m also foreigner -last year I opened credit card account with uob at the holland branch (but also opened uob one account at the same time). There was a ‘credit card specialist” there.Prior to that I tried online x2-3 times and always got rejected despite earning over the minimum required.,btohqsg
Yes just register today and top-up on Apr 30.,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 interest is credited already this morning.,btohqsg
Supposed to be $35k (guaranteed plus non guaranteed) in 2020 when projected in 1999.But your cash value now in 2024 is only $24k?,btohqsg
any idea which miles card is best for traveloka?,btohqsg
Have you tried this great tool calledheymax.ai?,btohqsg
Still Uob lady with travel category with $10 001 in lady savings.6mpd.,btohqsg
11.6k + 13.4k.. it's 25k  guaranteed plus non guaranteed. But this old school endowments damn jialat you pay forever 🤡I rather cut loss and have better opportunities elsewhere but OP already have some profits so should just pull and go.,btohqsg
Ah yes. Sorry I was looking at protection level.Eh not bad. Projection and actual quite close.,btohqsg
Ya not bad actually. But OP still needs to pay that's all.,btohqsg
Only one page? Got low and high projections?Or is this non participating,btohqsg
This kind of pre-2000 policy documents  a lot like that one leh... Non participating won't have non-guaranteed portion le.,btohqsg
This one is the 2000s-2010s documents. Then sometime in 2010s and now is 3.25% and 4.75%. Must dig out MAS rules.,btohqsg
I remember my 2000s documents is 5% and 7% also. But after 2014 one showing 3.25% and 4.75%. They even give you estimated EIR at either rates.,btohqsg
So this crowd sourced results is quite consistent with wz actual results. 3.6% pa for 25 years is ok ok la considering there were a good many years us rates near 0.Forced savings in a sense. 👍,btohqsg
GE S-Lion one looks like those kind of cashback endowments that let you take cashback yearly. 🤔 If not don't make sense to be negative one. Unless is investment plan  but 1996 don't think got much ILPs also..,btohqsg
Remember bank account savings rates won’t be at 4% pa forever. Confirmed peaked and will come down. Just when.,btohqsg
Maybe policy owner borrowed against it? Policy Loan rates are high.,btohqsg
Do you reckon bank will cut saving rates by a lot next year?,btohqsg
Probably also. That's why these crowdsourced info need more info not just based on table 👀,btohqsg
The cuts will be correlated with the speed US cut rates though may not be 1:1.,btohqsg
Good to lock in SSBs if u haven’t already.,btohqsg
That's why insurance companies can sell endowments.. because the fixed guaranteed cash really look attractive compared to those days when bank accounts only give at most 1% p.a. Then when you include the non-guaranteed cash values  🤯,btohqsg
SSB can’t catch up with inflation . Jin headache,btohqsg
U want safe. Nothing can beat inflation one. Sure have some risks,btohqsg
For me  maybe I too lazy lol. Jin tired to monitor. I guess etf is best suited for me,btohqsg
Mkt has run up by so much already  do u think the current 3.35 FD is reasonable? Or mkt can go up somemore?,btohqsg
Yeah etf might be decent. Cheaper method than unit trusts.Do some research and buy ETFs yourself using a cheap and reliable platform. Just don’t buy through insurance agents or bank pfcs.,btohqsg
Got lazier solution than researching ETFs also.. roboadvisors 🤣,btohqsg

Fd only lock in 1-2 years. Not worth. U mature when rates have surely dropped.,btohqsg
Yeah I know.. but you don't DCA.. 😅 might as well buy elsewhere instead..,btohqsg
Put back into my biz. Easier to manage risk. I m more sure,btohqsg
Now think back  really must have the balls to buy when mkt down a lot,btohqsg
Endowus this type is for people who don’t want or don’t know how to choose the underlying funds.U want to be cheapskate. U buy small amount in endowus. U see what funds in your portfolio u buy roughly the same funds on your own outside. Make sure u use low cost platform.If your own platform is same as endowus then don’t bother cheating. I don’t know what your costs are.,btohqsg
Anyone encounter Xnap unable to use recently ?,btohqsg
I think what u meant is this,btohqsg
Nothing about balls de.. just don't think and put in 😅 time in the market is better than timing the market. It's the difference between ~6% p.a. and 2.8% p.a.,btohqsg
Depends if you use cpf to invest too.,btohqsg
Ya. Hahaha sometimes can just do this. Want more cheapskate is just ask someone with endowus account to send u their portfolios 👀,btohqsg
My CPF strategy isOA after housing. All dump into Tbills for now. Once Tbills below 2.5% then leave in OSA just leave alone.,btohqsg
USD interest rate 4.85%  this is what I m getting currently.,btohqsg
Hahaha if you have long runway can risk la.. else tbills or leave in OA is good.,btohqsg
I’m old person. Not many time left….,btohqsg
Haha see risk appetite and runway. No wrong no right.,btohqsg
