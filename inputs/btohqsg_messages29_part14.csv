U think I still got a chance to receive any email from HDB for Oct 2024 Bto appt? My number is 290 away from the supply. Till now no email from HDB.,btohqsg
Case by case  write in to HDB to find out more,btohqsg
Can if your mom have hdb under her names she must sell,btohqsg
Got chance  due to high number. 121th percentile  if got also is #2 floor or #3 floor,btohqsg
Whenever I waited for bus and opposite is the macpherson new BTO‚Ä¶ I was wondering why it so empty‚Ä¶ They should have gotten the keys and move in for quite sometime‚Ä¶,btohqsg
True  near the circuit road balls right.. been a long time since completion..,btohqsg
What scheme would this be under?,btohqsg
If u are not married means your mom is the main applicantsThen if your mom currently hdb is brought directly from HDB like previous BTO etc... then your application is considered 2nd timer  MCPSBecause u are not married and under 35 means the main applicants is your mom,btohqsg
Your mum is now single yes,btohqsg
Hello  anyone could share chat link for Feb BTO at Woodlands,btohqsg
Hi  can i check if 1st timer application rate is lesser than 1  does the excess flats flow to 2nd timer or it goes to sbf?,btohqsg
Hello  is there any chat group for Stirling horizon Queenstown? üôèüèª,btohqsg
people already telegram compromised why you wanna go scold them more,btohqsg
This kind of idiots should be shot dead.  People's hard-earned money gone because of these good for nothing.,btohqsg
dont be so harsh on them  they are very likely victims too,btohqsg
if you wanna be hostile to the scammers themselves  sure i got no issue with that  im pretty hostile myself,btohqsg
but once the victim's phones and telegrams are compromised  the scammers will use their accounts to spread the messages further  all without the knowledge or permission of the victims,btohqsg
Are you alright  Wilson? You seem different today.,btohqsg
I need accumulate good karma for my SBF HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
Does first-timer families refer those that are married? Or haven‚Äôt rom couples also considered,btohqsg
Its referring to those family nucleus who haven't own any property before or in past 5 years  have a chance to select a flat.Those haven't ROM considered first timer  under fiance fiancee scheme,btohqsg
depends! fiance & fianc√©e scheme (if first timer)  are also considered first timer families!,btohqsg
Oops yes  that's what I meant üòÜ,btohqsg
Are those who purchased resale before converted to Citizen considered as 2nd timer?,btohqsg
For BTO  if application rate below 1  excess flats will flow to 2nd timer  for SBF  could be the same,btohqsg
Never take resale grant = first timerTake resale grant = 2nd timerFor PR buying resale no grant to take,btohqsg
Good Day All Would like to ask about whether it is advisable for me and partner to apply for HFE.I just graduated Uni Dec 24  while partner did not finish Uni and has been working since June 24 (6 months). I‚Äôve also just started work and drawing salary.Initial plan was to wait till she has worked for 12 months for us to apply so that we are eligible for HDB loan and EHG. But I believe by then our combined income would be around 9k so there isn‚Äôt much EHG eligible.Is it possible for us to apply now and try to appeal to be put into the deferred income assessment scheme? Or will we simply have wasted the HFE period with a low loan amount,btohqsg
You are eligible for DIA currently. It depends on your housing timeline. Have to factor in that once you BTO you might not get a queue number within supply.,btohqsg
Oh  I thought both applicants need to be students or graduated within 12 months. Because my partner actually dropped out more than a year ago and has been working for 6 months,btohqsg
Ah I see  thank you! So just apply and wait till signing of lease to confirm the DIA?,btohqsg
This project is under SERs  duno y this round not included in SBF.,btohqsg
Is there a group for Bukit Batok westville,btohqsg
Depends on mum status.  What happen to yr dad (core essential applicant)?  Women who are unmarried with child below 35 is classified as single. Thus can only apply 2rm direct fm Hdb.,btohqsg
Apply for HFE assessment to confirm household eligibility for grants  levies and loan amt. Every situation can be unique.  Application is free & helps to plan for next purchase effectively.,btohqsg
Hfe is a must to buy a resale/bto/sbf hdb flat,btohqsg
if u mean west brickville  herehttps://t.me/BukitBatokOCT2024BTO,btohqsg
Hi  if I successfully get a sbf the Buyer's Stamp Duty is paid by cash or cpf ?,btohqsg
I got the same thinking too. Got some block is totally vacant. I guess next sbf üòÇ,btohqsg
From Bto price to SBF price. Same area ‚Ä¶ different price,btohqsg
I don't mind to pay if I really able to get a Ballot number   cos resale price is much much higher in tat estate,btohqsg
Ya. SBF in Ubi already $700k  MacPherson $800k.. üòû Sigh. I think the BTO price at that time is around $600k and $700k.,btohqsg
Not easy to get balloted and get sbf. If u got one then consider urself winning the lottery.,btohqsg
Price is still way below market price. After 5years u can flip,btohqsg
I just saw 4room@alkaff lakeview at bidadari..sbf price is 700k. 1.1million is open market price. Crazy. After 5years mop surely can increase further,btohqsg
Yes MacPherson now the resale hdb already 1.1M  even 4th floor also 1MAll these are the hard cold real transaction to show how much people are willing to pay for your flat.,btohqsg
BTO/SBF is a Singaporean‚Äôs privilege. Go for it if you can  and in Singapore even second floor you hardly find an empty unit.,btohqsg
I bought my bto 3 room 10yrs ago at MacPherson for 340k üòÇ,btohqsg
Regretted nv ballot for 4 room.,btohqsg
I got the appt for SBF 2 years ago and gave it up cos officer say only left with 2nd floor. I don‚Äôt know why now the SBF (same area) got higher floor now.,btohqsg
2nd floor also have value. Sbf not easy to get ballot. If key ready then its worth it. Some sbf has long wait as well.,btohqsg
