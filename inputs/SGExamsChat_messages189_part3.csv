He‚Äôs referring to the GILS collapse in aq solution,btohqsg
They all exist as mobile ions,btohqsg
U mean there is a better word to use than ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù?,btohqsg
Giant ionic lattice structures dont collapse  they dissociate,btohqsg
Even txtbk says break apart i believe,btohqsg
His part (i) ans for beth is incorrect,btohqsg
Amount = moles. That's a fact,btohqsg
A lvls/uni 'amount' = no of moles,btohqsg
Yes hes not near fuzzy's level,btohqsg
idw distress any1 by sayin it in the o lvl grp instead,btohqsg
As in I'm pretty sure graphite is also correct,btohqsg
And should be the better answer,btohqsg
In my textbook under the section ‚Äúhow is steel made from iron‚Äù it didn‚Äôt mention the need to use argon in the process so I think o and a level learn different things,btohqsg
steel is indirectly produced from blast furnace,btohqsg
and we dont use graphite in blast furnace  but coke,btohqsg
So probably a levels ‚Äúgraphite‚Äù is considered wrong but o levels I need to write graphite,btohqsg
argon is introduced for an inert environment,btohqsg
U don't add argon into the steel wjat,btohqsg
but is to provide an inert environment,btohqsg
yeah I heard somewhere it‚Äôs supposed to prevent some unnecessary reaction,btohqsg
i rmb this qn have quite a few debate,btohqsg
But I don‚Äôt think I need to know that for my syllabus,btohqsg
in certain instances if ur pig iron has high % of carbon,btohqsg
I send here for easy reference,btohqsg
u dont need add carbon anymore,btohqsg
they say manufacturing  hence any substance that plays a role in steel making,btohqsg
In which case graphite and argon does,btohqsg
Why would u think of the environment,btohqsg
Yep  so both shld be accepted,btohqsg
but ya if i was doing it,btohqsg
But that does not mean graphite is wrong,btohqsg
cambridge can‚Äôt say graphite is wrong either although the concept of it may be out of the syllabus,btohqsg
but u only realised its correct via google right,btohqsg
if i was an o lvl student,btohqsg
I know that carbon is use in small quantity in steel making,btohqsg
i wouldn't have learnt graphite is involved in steel making,btohqsg
stop arguing about it and just drink juice,btohqsg
it could have been coke  other allotropes of carbon,btohqsg
but intuitively i will be able to understand why ppl will write argon  since its covered in prelims/notes etc,btohqsg
i heard the bio paper was fucked to a new level,btohqsg
smt like 6 chapters were tested or smt tite,btohqsg
i wanna see how guai lan did seab become,btohqsg
LIKE LESS THAN 50% OF THE SYLLABUS TESTED SIA,btohqsg
i legit feel bad for this yr o level kids,btohqsg
they still have the benefit of CLT,btohqsg
i wont be complain if i was taking Os this yr,btohqsg
apart from english rappers in english LC,btohqsg
i think my year (2018) had it alot easier,btohqsg
yeah at least less thing to study üòÇ,btohqsg
my year had the fucked up huan emath qn,btohqsg
