Sale of balance? Applications for that are the same time as BTO  and the answer is no one knows for sure but based on past launches  usually late part of the month. You can follow HDB's tele channel to get updates when applications openhttps://t.me/SingaporeHDB,btohqsg
HDB to launch 9 500 BTO flats on Nov 23; 3 projects under prime housing modelhttps://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/hdb-to-launch-9500-bto-flats-on-nov-23-3-projects-under-prime-housing-model,btohqsg
this launch location is better.... almost all is near by MRT or having good Park View,btohqsg
23rd Nov will be the launch for all who have been asking@jingho06@EmileeTann,btohqsg
Only the canopy project under Queenstown which is also the community care apartments (for elderly) will not be under PLH.,btohqsg
Is Bukit Batok included in the Nov 23 exercise?,btohqsg
bukit gombak ba  not bukit batok iirc,btohqsg
@xiaobaozi_exe@DuNn0YohThat's strange. I saw batok being included  but was puzzled as to why it was not included in that ST article,btohqsg
Oh my bad  didn’t see that.,btohqsg
Ya then it’s part of this month as well,btohqsg
Maybe they miss out ba.  Either that or they delay the launch. Could happen also. Cos previously it happened once,btohqsg
or maybe a st typo problem ahah,btohqsg
Alright  thanks for the info 🙏🏼,btohqsg
https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landingthis shows the launches and details  theres bukit batok so should be a ST typo,btohqsg
Actually no typo  we probably never read properly. It’s actually written Batok will launch on 23. 😂,btohqsg
Maybe we pay more attention to the MRT so it is Bukit Gombak to us instead,btohqsg

There are Advertisement that give you half truth information so as to get you to call them call fishing.,btohqsg
You don't keep applying for HLE,btohqsg
This means that HLE should only be applied only 2 times right? One during selection of flat and second time towards the collection of keys?,btohqsg
Hi can i check for the HLE loan  will it drop if i change job half way and have a month interval of no CPF after the original loan amount has been given during the selection of house from the actual collection of key?Once you sign the booking it is cast in stone.,btohqsg
Technically should be one only. Unless you go and apply another one and give to HDB.,btohqsg
