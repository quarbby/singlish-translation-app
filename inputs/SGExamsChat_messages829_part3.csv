hi guys i got muted from PSQ,btohqsg
Flooding means to spam text messages in one go. I sent multiple messages in one sitting meaning I broke whatever I wanted to say into smaller lines and different messages so that people don't get overwhelmed and info-dumped with my yapping. Why is it that doing so is an issue since I sent messages after every few minutes? 8 messages is the limit yes  but it should be specified 8 messages limited to how long can a user then send their 9th message since some people are fast keyboard warriors. So many people are breaking the chat rules indiscreetly  unconsciously or inexplicably but there's no action taken aside from a few warnings. I'm not complaining but I wanted to see clarification on this matter since it seems a little unfair to be muted albeit temporarily over message flooding the chat for such an innocuous intent behind the action. Plus  you guys should just implement a 1 minute slow-motion cool down every message sent into PSQ chat if you don't want such further scenarios to unknowingly happen for whatever reasons.,btohqsg

The races of the earth are like trees. Each according to its kind brings forth the fruit known as civilization. As russet apples and pippins may grow from the same trunk  and as peaches may even be grafted on a plum tree  so the culture of allied races may be transferred from one to another. Yet no one expects pears on cherry branches  and it is useless to look for Slavic civilization among the Chinese. Each may borrow from its neighbors  but will put its own stamp upon what it obtains. The nature of a people's culture  like the flavor of a fruit  depends primarily upon racial inheritance which can be changed only by the slow processes of biological variation and selection.,btohqsg
