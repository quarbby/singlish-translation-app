Hi  when used car dealer says they provide engine & gearbox warranty till end of COE.. is it a big deal? or this is norm?,btohqsg
10 years/unlimited mileage engine & gearbox warranty plus 10 times free servicing at own in house workshop,btohqsg
Usually there are other requirements for the warranty to be valid. e.g compulsory servicing every 5000 km/6 months.  Change spark plugs/ATF/coolant at xxx kmFree servicing only covers basic engine oil/filter and anything else will be chargeable,btohqsg
Maybe for phv will be more useful due to incredible mileage,btohqsg
If unlimited mileage is good as some AD set for new cars at 100K km / 10 years  whichever comes first.,btohqsg
