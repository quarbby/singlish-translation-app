Hi guys! I have recently gotten a frank credit card. I was wondering if i will get cashback for paying my starhub bills and car insurance/road tax.,btohqsg
Joint deposit account? or joint credit card account??,btohqsg
I think just get from any of the local bank will do. I used POSB which is min $500,btohqsg
Good to have a joint acct in a bank where both of you also has a single name acct. I use POSB too. The reason is  sometimes you may need to transfer funds from singlt to joint or vice versa in big amt. If it is within same bank  no concern about setting the correct transfer limit.,btohqsg
Any bank will do later on when the kids come in cda accounts will be add on as well :),btohqsg
