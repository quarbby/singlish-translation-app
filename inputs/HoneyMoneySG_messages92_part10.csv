FRS is the amount in SA.. I did the transfer myself so as to hit FRS faster n earning higher interest,btohqsg
Why is it a bad move? You will be earning extra 1.5% in SA.,btohqsg
If you didn't need the amount sitting in OA (to use for housing  etc.)  then it's okay to move it to SA to earn more interest.Anyway now that you've hit FRS in SA and if you're still receiving employee/employer contributions + CPF interest  when you reach 55 your SA will be above the FRS  so the extra amount that will transfer back to OA which is higher than what you would have had if you left the funds in OA.,btohqsg
Thanks for your reply! Oh yes at 55 still allow to transfer back to OA.. property prices really high nowadays so I probably got to wait awhile more to get property,btohqsg
Property prices cuts both ways though‚Ä¶when you sell high you also need to buy high  same for when prices are low.But I think now also considering the higher interest rates (although they‚Äôre coming down a bit somewhat) it‚Äôs not a great time to be moving,btohqsg
