Your Evening Quick Read ‚Äì 22 July 2021QuantumScape  a stock that is floatingIt was once a hype stock. Any news of the latest development spur buyers to bid up the stock prices. However  in recent months  investors have been lukewarm towards the company. The electric vehicle battery technology company has an average price target of $40  which is much higher than its current stock price. While this would suggest much good news ahead  investors has a wait and see attitude.Huge Potential that Demands PatienceThere are a couple of good things that can go right for the company. For one  QS is resting on breakthrough technology. It is venturing into the unknown with solid-state lithium anode chargeable batteries. Given the solid-state nature  there is no liquid acting as a medium to carry electric charges. The lithium anodes replace the graphite anode that is common in many EV battery technologies.This version of the technology has great promise. It strives to lower the cost of electric vehicle batteries and promote better safety. It can lead to a higher range and a quicker charging process. A solid-state battery is likened to the holy grail of an EV car development  as there aren't any such automotive-grade solid-state batteries.Unloved or Pre-love?The company is in the developmental stage  and investors are mindful that there will not be significant sales for several years. While the price target is attractive  the stocks have unattractive ratings  with only about two ratings as a buy. And this could point to the unpalatable risk-reward dynamic.As we look ahead  the EV market is likely to see batteries with up to 10 layers  and QS is poised for such development as its batteries are like cards  stacking over each other. The company begins with a single layer  and with bigger battery cells  QS can finalize its cathode material. Then  by experimenting and choosing the suitable materials  they can reach a comprehensive battery cell design and shift to validating into production.That's what we could expect in the coming year and a half.Valuing disruptive technology is an uphill task  and analysts' QS ratings and price targets reflect that nature. Compared to its 52-week high  it is down by about 80%. On the flip side  it is roughly 150% up from its 52-week low.On which side would you look? That's the keen eye of an investor.Cheers  Pika Nat.If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will be help us reach to a wider audience.,btohqsg

I  just read an article about the Myanmar Covid situation  really disturbing. Junta want to catch all the doctor and nurse that has been helping to patch up the injured protestor. Now the Junta is pleading for medical volunteers to help out at the understaff hospitals but no one is going back due to fear. Due to lack of medical infrastructure and expertise  we won`t be able to estimate how much the population has already been infected. Also not sure whether any action plan has been imposed to fight Covid.,btohqsg
Asian micro $0.007 last line.I feel it has bottomed $0.007/$0.008 and expecting micros and old pennies to be played as more WFH.So added some $0.008. Camp and wait. Hopefully pays off for me,btohqsg
But $0.007 if breaks and no quick recovery. Then it goes to coma mode,btohqsg
