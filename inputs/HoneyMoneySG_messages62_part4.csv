"where do you see the ""Total Relationship Balance""? i don't see it in my statement",btohqsg
how did you calculate the 3.55%? i am existing fastsaver account,btohqsg
Hi  if I filled up the cimb bank credit card appn form first  and then go fill up the singsaver form  is that ok? Or I'll have to cancel the cimb appn. And re-sign up using singsaver form? Trying to sign up for the cimb visa signature. Thanks!,btohqsg
existing is ironically easier to hit 3.55% p.a. compared to new customer (more TNC to watch).https://www.cimb.com.sg/savings2?cid=a1:pb_a2:casa_a3:CASA-AUG-3.5_a4:080823_a5:pmax_a6:go_a7:cmpgn_a8:rb1&dclid=&gclid=Cj0KCQjwuZGnBhD1ARIsACxbAVg0dWlFSB-P3j9DLc-Uf-kGvtgLg4Tn73g2Qv9AXAwoShqhxd2GdjYaAgF6EALw_wcB#Existing%20Customers%20,btohqsg
So I won‚Äôt earn that much in Sep if I put the funds in this month,btohqsg
for EXISTING customers  the KEY figure is your 31st July DAY END balance...Incremental balance is compared against THAT static figure,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs ok if I transfer most of my funds now if my 31st July balance is fairly low?,btohqsg
i don't know what is your definition of low..If your 31st July DAY END balance is $1000  then EVERYTHING above $1k will earn 3.55% p.a.,btohqsg
Hi guys  any expert knows how to transition smoothly from OCBC 360 to UOB One? Details here:https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/15y0qfk/how_to_utilise_uob_one_account_in_my_case/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2,btohqsg
just move 100k over from OCBC 360 to UOB One on the 1st of the month,btohqsg
assuming you already got your UOB Card and ready to spend,btohqsg
The spend criteria is based on calendar month so no need to consider billing cycle,btohqsg
If u are just comparing with your regular saving account ‚Ä¶ yes it has better interest rates ‚Ä¶But if u compare to other lobang share here u might get better returns ‚Ä¶ all depend on wat u want to do with your money,btohqsg
For those who successfully setup UOB cc bill payment using giro to HSBC EGA were there any notifications once the giro setup was completed?,btohqsg
HSBC April bonus interest is in~,btohqsg
When GIRO setup completed is not important. Most Important is if there is a GIRO payment instructions printed on the credit card statement or not.Read thishttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/95726,btohqsg
sigh nothing for me... i am on alternate months so I will only get March and May bonus interest.,btohqsg
you MUST wait for your credit card statement to have the GIRO comment under Payment section before it is deemed completed,btohqsg
update:its correct based on statement  but statement itself is wrong.I deposited a few amounts since 11 March  but the transactions from 11-12 March are shown as 13 March on HSBC statement.(Checked tx dates on DBS account where the funds were transferred from).If i update my calculations based on that then its correctSo its like S$12.68 difference if they were counted on the actual dates,btohqsg
weekend deposits aren't calculated till the next working day?,btohqsg
some banks count some banks don't..my brain is not big enough to remember who does..so I always assume cutoff timing of 10am Saturday and it has never failed me,btohqsg
Does OCBC titanium excludes amaze transactions ?,btohqsg

Wow. Is the 6 miles applicable for existing ocbc member?,btohqsg
Hi all  chose dining for uob lady.will it get bonus miles if i pay via applepay or shopbackpay at dining restaurant? Thank you,btohqsg
just normal bank transfer from corporate bank account,btohqsg
Anyone knows how to change IRAS Giro monthly payment from OCBC or DBS to UOB bank acc? IRAS says don't need to terminate and just apply with UOB Internet Banking  whereas UOB Internet Banking indicate that need to terminate existing giro arrangements and wait for 30 days then applying to UOB Internet Banking. But I recall seeing on IRAS website that if we terminate the monthly giro arrangement IRAS will require full payment immediately.,btohqsg
my understanding is that new giro arrangement will supercede the old one.. so not sure why need to terminate and wait 30 days before re-applying.. doesn't make sense to me,btohqsg
don't submit online. use paper form.,btohqsg
Does using instarem when buying flight tickets earn u 4x miles?,btohqsg
Travel excluded for citibank rewards.... Other cards i cant advice,btohqsg
anyone know what are the cards that can earn more miles when buying air tickets?i havekf ascend silverciti premiermiles,btohqsg
If it‚Äôs different banks  dbs to ocbc you can select as SALA or payroll. But if it‚Äôs dbs to dbs  in the comments section you can just put Jul‚Äô23 Salary.  Pay now and giro fees are different for DBS corporate accounts I think.,btohqsg
If you need help you can drop me a text but so far when I wire transfer to my employees  it‚Äôs mostly DBS or OCBC account.,btohqsg
By the way fast payment will cost additional 50 cents for corporate accounts. Just so you take note  giro is cheaper,btohqsg
Stupid thing. Caught on this too,btohqsg

Hi  I looked up in the chat and learned that Shopback Pay is considered an online transaction for Citi SMRT card. But can I check if anybody has any experience paying on the website with Citi SMRT card through Shopback? Is that also considered an online transaction?,btohqsg
