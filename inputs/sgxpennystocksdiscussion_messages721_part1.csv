Background on Sinochem and Halcyon- Merger took place 2016 where they offered $0.75 per share in cash 💰 to acquire just over 30% of Halchon.- then  they took make the MGO to all shareholders at the same price of $0.75.Reason  I am looking into this is because they recently up their stake by over 10% at $0.45.Price is less than half and it will be good to study whether they might proceed to make the MGO since price now much more favourable for them.Much more to study.Those who have information do share with us too,btohqsg
For any buy out they need to make sure they have secured funding to make it happen. Take time as they need to free up cash .Because big companies usually have debt  s too,btohqsg
Not sure if they have already raised or in the middle of,btohqsg
I think if they really in the midst of raising then they will have the money to make the offer since they already controlling and price is cheap now  good timing if Sinochem wants full control,btohqsg
I believe matter of time Sinochem to make the MGO for Halcyon. Makes sense from all angle.If so  they should offer same at the recent 10% upstake $0.45 which is a almost 100% premium from current market price $0.235,btohqsg
buay tahan liao..bo lang share gear⚙️ yesterday.. gap-up opening BO records closing high 925.. can our gear⚙️ close 95c or above later😬😜,btohqsg
13th Sept 22 - Sinochem International raised funds .Ultimately for the total buy out to happen  they will need to have ready cash then make the offer.Hence  to study they balance sheet is key to whether they really plan to make offer for halcyon,btohqsg
Or attempt to raise  this fund raising throught private placement  i do not whether its done or in process. Does anyone know?,btohqsg
With this  i reckon for anyone who can hold and keep freezer can buy Halcyon $0.225 and below. this 2 trading days will see some selling pressure from T+4  T+5.,btohqsg

On December 12  Sinochem International Corporation announced that it intends to acquire 100% shares of five companies  namely the Sinochem Plastics Co.  Ltd.  Sinochem Jiangsu Co.  Ltd.  Sinochem Qingdao Co.  Ltd.  Sinochem International Chemicals (Hong Kong) Ltd. and Sinochem Japan Branch  with the transaction amount not exceeding CNY1.744 billion. The aforementioned five companies entered into the listed company system by way of agreement transfer. This is an important move for Sinochem Group to integrate the internal business of its Chemical segment as well as a solid step for Sinochem International to become a leading innovative fine chemicals enterprise.The acquisition is expected to increase Sinochem International’s total assets by CNY2.4 billion and raise the Company's current net profit by CNY258 million. At the same time  it will also help Sinochem International to further enhance its business capability  providing customers with innovative  high quality  green products and integrated solutions in areas such as automotive chemicals  agrochemicals and electronic chemicals.Source:http://www.sinochem.com.cn/eng/s/10366-28002-115974.html,btohqsg
Sinochem is Chinese Majority State Owned Firm which is listed in China which have a knack of acquiring other firms of good synergy.They make reasonable offers as seen in their past MGO to all Halcyon Shareholders back in 2016 at $0.750.Because they have done it before  i believe they will do it again once they have accessed to the secured funding to make this deal.PA  TA  recent volume for Halcyon shows that something already cooking up actually.Do keep Halcyon in view. Could be one of the easier 100% gain and gift by China's Sinochem within a year.?,btohqsg
