in regards to not liking the answers you hear,btohqsg
First you implied that if someone studies more than 5 subjects  they can go poly instantly. Thats invalid.Secondly you said that priv candidates can use DAE to join poly. That is also invalid.Lastly you shown this article which proves that priv candidates cannot take DAE.,btohqsg
yeah lol don‚Äôt get why he‚Äôs so rude,btohqsg
spreading false knowledge and refusing to believe the correct information,btohqsg
the first implication is usually for students who take more than 5 subjects and do well in their national exams but obviously it won't apply for all scenarios (l1r4 for most  even N(A) uses a similar concept but with ELMAB3 unless jc which uses l1r5)your information as for the second statement about dae being invalid for private candidates is also outdated,btohqsg
so how do you use dae for private candidates?,btohqsg
because as of 2024 October it is not true to have DAE for private candidates sitting for O levels.,btohqsg
Those instructions are for SCHOOl candidates,btohqsg
you're just learning all the hearsay from your teachers you approached asking briefly about this,btohqsg
Priv candidates is not affiliated with gov schools  hence DAE is never applicable.,btohqsg
That does not imply the same thing as private candidates who came from secondary school,btohqsg
do private candidates not get stationed at ACTUAL schools as their exam centre to sit for papers and collect results?,btohqsg
your logic is not enough to validate your reasoning,btohqsg
go for it if you're interested,btohqsg
cuz I need more info on the programme,btohqsg
do you understand what your saying?,btohqsg
i think i made my points pretty simply and clearly enough,btohqsg
they get stationed at schools for their final exams (O levels) and then walk off after the paper. Which in conlcusion has got nothing to do with DAE since its only for taking exams.,btohqsg
more like you aren't getting where everyone is coming from and keep inferring assumptions based on the things you know,btohqsg
not fighting sial but this fella wants to keep carrying on,btohqsg
i wanna continue with my korean romfan üò≠,btohqsg
it‚Äôs like speaking to a wall,btohqsg
update from my peers  you can dae as private,btohqsg
the reason why i got confused is because the article you sent stated that singapore poly only accepts JAE from private candidates but after research it seems that all schools allow for dae but its compulsory to have be in a nitec course (3.5+) or higher nitec course (2.0+) to enlist for DAE into poly. For private candidates without being in Ite they can only go jae route.,btohqsg
Your point of private candidate taking dae is valid. But in my case since im not an ite student taking private candidate i dont think i am eligible for DAE into poly unfortunately. Correct me if these info are wrong.,btohqsg
Anyone who retake O/N levels but never show up?,btohqsg
Will they call my home or nt? I worried parents will know üòî,btohqsg
From experience  we get 0 if we dont show up. Moe does not take the effort to inform our parents or call since they earn money either way.,btohqsg
Need use q tip before fr,btohqsg
No 2 more weeks till majority of papers end,btohqsg
I thought O Level last until November,btohqsg
and A Level until December üíÄ,btohqsg
Ya lah after 29 oct only left chem amd phys p1 for me,btohqsg

Except one day is ss and amath p1 or p2,btohqsg
another pain for some is POA+Biology/Physics,btohqsg
The reliability of train services should have no bearing on how public transport fares are set  said Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat.There are ‚Äúother measures in place to ensure service standards are met‚Äù  he said in a statement on the 6-day East-West Line disruption.https://str.sg/7kzZ,btohqsg
a popular term for Korean Literature ( fictional works or film  typically it's books )it's supposed to berofan(romantic fantasy) and not romfan because i actually typedromcom(romantic comedy) before the edited message,btohqsg
I feel like if we're unable to use the public transport we're paying so much for  they shouldn't be charging us so much for it,btohqsg
‚Äúthis train will stop for a few mins to allow our engineers to inspect the tracks‚Äù,btohqsg
idk they just announced a few mins stop to inspect the tracks but now carrying on as per normal,btohqsg
