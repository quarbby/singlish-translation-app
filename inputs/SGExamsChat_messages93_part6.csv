I can only find the one for math,btohqsg
Yea i only know of SPM,btohqsg
not sure whats special science program,btohqsg
I can't find a link to SPM on the math website lol,btohqsg
Like I can google it directly,btohqsg
Can't find it on the nus math site for some reason,btohqsg
U know the mods can alrdy,btohqsg
but idrl a lot of aspects of chem HAHA,btohqsg
For students who matriculated in AY2019/2020 or laterIn order to complete the SPM  a participant must pass the following modules:MA2101S    Linear Algebra II (S)MA2108S    Mathematical Analysis I (S)MA2202S    Algebra I (S)MA3111S/MA3211S    Complex Analysis I (S)MA4291   Undergraduate Topics in Mathematics IMA4292   Undergraduate Topics in Mathematics IISPM students may read two level 5000 modules (except for those listed below) in lieu of MA4291 and MA4292  subject to the approval of the Department.MA5203    Graduate Algebra IMA5205    Graduate Analysis IMA5245    Advanced Financial MathematicsMA5247    Computational Methods in FinanceMA5248    Stochastic Analysis in Mathematical FinanceWhen an SPM student goes for student exchange programme  he/she may read an equivalent overseas module in place of one S-module. Each student is only allowed to replace one S-module this way.,btohqsg
So u only love organic chem,btohqsg
I don't think studying a pure science is a good idea though,btohqsg
Mainly go down the research path,btohqsg
CS is q enticing to be honest,btohqsg
but I don't see myself coding,btohqsg
I want to do something chem-related,btohqsg
I enjoy coding and thinking about stuff that's why I went for CS,btohqsg
People like to joke about bandwagoning,btohqsg
Chem eng is not chem related lol,btohqsg
(also I want less competitors  please don't bandwagon thx),btohqsg
