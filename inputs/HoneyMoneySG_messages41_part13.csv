Hey guysFor singsaver March madness card promo. By when I should get the $228 credited?,btohqsg
Because I want to cancel the card  so means I‚Äôll have to do it only after I‚Äôll get the Cashback. So this amount  will be credited to my bank account ? How does that work?Thanks,btohqsg
U cannot cancel within one year. Or the cashback will claw back,btohqsg
Hey folks  anyone here using the Diners Sheng Siong Card? I shop grocery most of the time at Sheng Siong and sometimes at FairPrice. I read that this Diners gives up to 5% Rebate on your groceries with no minimum spend. It gives me a complimentary Lounge access every year.My spending at Sheng Siong is not much  less than $500.Should I apply for this Diners or there is a better card for me to consider with equivalent or better benefits?  I don't want to be tied down by a minimum spend criterion. Thanks!,btohqsg
I think POSB Everyday also has 5% rebate for Sheng Siong. Think may be that is a better choice for me? Any thoughts guys?,btohqsg
I tot boc sheng siong card has higher rebate?,btohqsg
Yuu card for giant 5% no min spend. Up to 18% with $600 min spendhttps://youtu.be/ygJ3I9i31cY,btohqsg
Yes  that one is better. DBS CSO is reachable than DCS. Cashback cap is $30 for POSB Sheng Siong with no min spending (can spend up to $600 to enjoy 5% rebate),btohqsg
Better download  read and review the SingSaver Promo T&Cs carefully. Have to do your homework.,btohqsg

maybe eh. now i am thinking how much the profit it will be if we buy from official website. because the agent will also get paid from the company if we buy the ticket from them even with lower price,btohqsg
Yes. Either way you still get 4mpd,btohqsg
Agent bulk purchase from cruise n get wholesale price  that is why agent can sell cheaper. It is similar to a buyer buy 500 cartons of coke from Coke company directly  it will be cheaper because of bulk purchase.,btohqsg
