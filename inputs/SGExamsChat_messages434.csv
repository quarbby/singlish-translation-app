How does one create a resume when he doesn't haven't any work experience,btohqsg
The qn is why do u need a resume,btohqsg
When i was sec4  my school had some school internship programme and they told us to just put our acads and cca activities lmaoBut i suppose can just add some skills you have and any portfolio you think is relevant (and from my experience   im quite sure the companies that responded to me did not even look at my resume),btohqsg
