and now RI/HC will have like 80% 70RP rate bro,btohqsg
How can it be lol I donâ€™t think their GP dist rate is that high,btohqsg
I would think their GP dist rate is 60-65%,btohqsg
Maybe like half 70rp is more realistic,btohqsg
60% assuming RI GP rate is 5/6 in 10 get A,btohqsg
my batch was 6 in 10,btohqsg
why gas ge been the principal for so long,btohqsg
Ya sia. All the other merged JCs had a change of principal after the merger,btohqsg
Yijc is the only one that havenâ€™t change yet,btohqsg
Make the most out of the circumstances you're in  use it to your own advantages,btohqsg
Confirm have one it's just you have yet to see it or idk,btohqsg
based on my own experience and my other ip friends stories,btohqsg
in ip schs some teachers dont rly bother,btohqsg
they give you readings and worksheets,btohqsg
ny peaked during your time meh?,btohqsg
yaisa. they only want the grades but sg education is pushing to have a more holistic education not everything depends on grades anymore.,btohqsg
khanacademy saved my ass through ip,btohqsg
for me it was copying friends hw,btohqsg
did yall have compulsory projects throughout y1-y4,btohqsg
i had 2 projects per subject so 12 a year then 48 projects across y1-y4,btohqsg
that thing wah fun is fun but damn mafan,btohqsg
ppl want us to have good grades cuz only good grades can go so far,btohqsg
my sec4 was about stats bruh,btohqsg
1st sem was stats2nd sem was about applying trigo irl,btohqsg
you have to do creative project about a math topic,btohqsg
basically the cognitive bias of swimmer's body illusion,btohqsg
i had to make rube goldberg forenglishproject,btohqsg
last time for math we had to do desmos drawings,btohqsg
YA YA THAT WAS MY SEC2 PROJECT,btohqsg

lol we did it in sec3  sec2 was some measurement stuff (ez A),btohqsg
no is like they ask us to draw something in desmos based on the theme (COVID 19),btohqsg
Ya it was q fun act,btohqsg
it was my favourite out of all the math projects,btohqsg
i remember doing that for a friend in the states so she could graduate high school lol,btohqsg
too broke to hire new principal ah,btohqsg
Maybe they think yijc doesnâ€™t deserve a better principal,btohqsg
@chemcerdamn nus assumes everyone gets U for PW,btohqsg
what does the portal look like,btohqsg
if you selected A levels they should have asked for GP and PW before you key in your subjects,btohqsg
ye I know  just trolling with bedok as per usual,btohqsg
Yeah probably will try to stay as as principal as long as he can until heâ€™s forced to retire,btohqsg
But anyway if moe asks him to move to another sch he will just have to follow,btohqsg
Hopefully not another jc tho lol,btohqsg
even they dont hv hope in us,btohqsg
i mean i dont blame them,btohqsg
the mean n median rp confirm damn bad ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
but too bad they gonna close down le,btohqsg
Well while itâ€™s true that the results are bad because most of the ppl inside yijc are clowns  the principal definitely plays a part too. Just look at srjc and nyjcâ€™s meteoric rise. Nyjcâ€™s cop literally halved for both streams in just 15+ years. The principal before Mr Low implemented a lot of good practices and took care of the welfare of students.,btohqsg
Then the results also improved tremendously as the sch became more popular and began attracting better students,btohqsg
