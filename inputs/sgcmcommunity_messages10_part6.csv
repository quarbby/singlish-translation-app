So strange  I tried to forward a video of a Tesla Model Y car on auto-pilot colliding with a standing $3.5 million Cirrus Vision aircraft  failing to recognize the rear of the aircraft's fuselage elevated above the ground. But sgcm bot deleted my post after a few secs. Is the video faked or?According to Electrek  the owner used the Smart Summon remote drone call feature from the parking lot. The option requires the user to hold their finger on a button in the app while the robot car is moving. In the event of a dangerous situation  simply take your hand off the screen.,btohqsg
Can lodge such behaviour to police for further prosecution?,btohqsg

The road hogger   road hogging is actually a very inconsiderate act   and jam the traffic   forcing lots of car to slow down and have to over take from the left . The chain effect and is actually very severe,btohqsg
Traffic will be much better if driver don’t hog the lane   as overtaking lane cars can move faster and easier to change lane,btohqsg
Some time driving slowly does not mean it is safe,btohqsg
you all can see there is actually alot of accident due to road hogging  then the impatient driver behind will over take from the left  and lead to accident  and some times is fatal,btohqsg
road hogger is no different from road bully,btohqsg
In my mind I am reading that as a beetle. Just me 🤣,btohqsg

many years ago i was pulled over by a cop along ECP toward changi airport. we had a nice chat for nearly 20 minutes. at that time i was driving Alfa. he admired Alfa because he himself is also driving one privately. Then he says sinkies are most hoggers (dont shoot me here). they think just because they are doing 100 they can occupy the fast lane and refused to switch to slow lane. he also says Malaysian drivers have better etiquettes that do not hog fast lanes as much.Personally I agree with him.,btohqsg
did you notice - in germany  drivers can drive so fast like past 250 even with cars on the slow lane? because the fast lane is almost always clear. once a driver sees fast car approaching he would switch to the slow lane. or once a fast car passes after using the fast lane  he switches to the slow lane to stay in that one.,btohqsg
"you wont see ""slow"" cars use the fast lane even though he maybe doing 230 or more",btohqsg
So he pull u over is to give a ticket?,btohqsg
yeah i was going fast. but i explained to him i was in a hurry to airport and so he let me off.,btohqsg
he told me if got caught best to show air ticket,btohqsg
but we chat longer becuse we like alfas. haha,btohqsg
At Malaysia  of. Course no body dares to hog fast lane 😂Oil tanking coming behind at 160km/h.. on fast laneUnless you wanna be roti prata. Then you hog😂😂😂,btohqsg
NO. that is not true at all,btohqsg
NO turcks in malaysia go at that kind of speeds,btohqsg
U were in a hurry and he let u off? (1) …. U in a hurry and still can hat for 20 mins? (2)??,btohqsg
the only worry in malaysia is you cannot drive FAST at 160 with trucks or buses on the the SLOW lane because you never know when they would suddenly come out. that is the danger,btohqsg
yes we chat on private topics on cars hogging speeding etc,btohqsg
this is long ago more than 10 years ago,btohqsg
