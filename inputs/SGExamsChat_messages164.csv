Hi.I'm a poly student.I took O level  so I can understand your feeling and how stressful you are  especially O level is coming soon.So  to ease your worries or stress about O level  here's the tips:1. Study for half an hour to 45 minutes then relax for 20 minutes then continue studying (non-stop process unless you're having a meal)If you studying straight for many hours without having a break  you will make a lot of mistakes even if you actually know how to do (unless you're like a robot that 100% won't make any mistakes at all)2. Listen to a smooth music that can cool yourself down. Otherwise  do simple exercise.3. When you're feeling stress while studying  try to press something that is soft (e.g. soft toy)  so can slightly relax your stress,btohqsg
Thought it's compulsory to take Elementary Mathematics?,btohqsg
Because some people might not be able to revise with music,btohqsg
If they are on the vocal,btohqsg
I listen to catchy music when doing math,btohqsg
I meant like if you're feeling stress  either leave everything aside then listen to music then continue doing once feeling better  or listen to music while studying.,btohqsg
It depends if your a visual learner or auditory one,btohqsg
There are more than 1 Way to reduce stress,btohqsg
So whichever method people have is ya,btohqsg
i think he did sbb last yr,btohqsg
so this yr no need to take,btohqsg
I feel like I should be stressed with olevels next week but I’m not,btohqsg
I am so scared rn that i think i gonna do 10 plus editing practices,btohqsg
I maybe need go ite xd,btohqsg
If an essay question is 16 marks  Do you write 8 points or 16 points?,btohqsg
ok i dont take f&n anymore,btohqsg
editing i feel q easy but alw fked up,btohqsg
i thgt ite needs u to pass english too,btohqsg
I mean if go higher nitec,btohqsg
End up late one year oni ma,btohqsg
But just saying ite no need to pass eng,btohqsg
I mean why aim for ite,btohqsg
2 with higher nitec if u do well enough,btohqsg
Imagine if this happens tomorrow for practical haha,btohqsg
Lol jurong east experience a lot of wind,btohqsg
Sian but i live at such a low level,btohqsg
I got 1/10 for my prelim,btohqsg
Then my friend told me to might as well tick all,btohqsg
Stress def building up every passing dau,btohqsg
Cannot tick all.Tick all means no marks at all,btohqsg
I was sent to english remedial for like 2 days,btohqsg
And my teacher treated bbt 🤩,btohqsg
I remember when I was in sec 5  someone really put all ticks. Then he got 0 mark for that.My teacher said that put all ticks is the same as leave the blanks (means didn't do at all),btohqsg
Nvm imma try my best for el,btohqsg
gl for chem prac tmr guys,btohqsg
Anyone not studying English and math but studying for next next weeks papers 😂,btohqsg
how to study for e math,btohqsg
Aiyah do so many already 😂,btohqsg
I probably need to review all the basic concepts though,btohqsg
eng maybe u revise like the compre techniques ??,btohqsg
Erm i want to ask you sth,btohqsg
Idk my English is quite ok I think,btohqsg
So I’m not gonna revise it anymore,btohqsg
meanwhile im stuck at b4 bc of my stupid compre,btohqsg
How much do you score for compre,btohqsg

Like did your teacher told you about the sf rule like 0.3×500÷40= 3,btohqsg
I learned it Long time ago,btohqsg
Like round off to the least significant figure,btohqsg
hi guys does anyone have a list of all the formulas for mathh :-(,btohqsg
Can i everything 3 sf 😆,btohqsg
U should try not to memorise,btohqsg
i only memorise the graphs cos i always confuse them lolz,btohqsg
Multiplication and division round off to the least number of sf,btohqsg
Addition and subtraction round off to the least number of dp,btohqsg
Wah i hate it so much,btohqsg
Why cant they j do it like math,btohqsg
Either perfect value or 3sf or acc to qn,btohqsg
or 1 d.p. for angles or 2d.p. for money,btohqsg
Why can't all the science agree to all 3 sf,btohqsg
I alw use 3sf in chem,btohqsg
Physics is 3 sf also what. Only using instruments than follow their measurements,btohqsg
Not the case frm 2016 onwards (acc to my teacher),btohqsg
Chem has a diff format btw,btohqsg
or like look thru things u did,btohqsg
n honestly there eas this maths book i bought that taught every chap but it was so good xuz its like got csrtoon n drawing,btohqsg
all the best to all those taking chem prac today !!! y'all know more than y'all think 💪💪💪✨✨✨,btohqsg
Atb to all.the JC2 taking chem,btohqsg
atb to anyone whos taking exam tdy,btohqsg
anyone got stats tips bo pls help idw to fail,btohqsg

that's cool and all but imagine having to pander to a highly subjective marking scheme,btohqsg
Study with tutor giving tips. 😂,btohqsg
thats cool and all but imagine having to remember how particles work,btohqsg
its all abt the flair man,btohqsg
No need la hahaha  as long as understand can liak,btohqsg
Particles work by shouting orders to them,btohqsg
i heard a’s geog fking bad lmao,btohqsg
like its hella thick or wtv,btohqsg
then it worsened when they revised it,btohqsg
Anyone here thinks his or her chemistry teacher sucks?,btohqsg
but i remember my bio cher,btohqsg
but also rlly nice to us,btohqsg
My F maths teacher always says the assignment questions are obvious  so skip most of them. 😂,btohqsg
we had so many remedial lessons for her to make sure that the entire class passed,btohqsg
did work out in the end i somehow scored well for combined science,btohqsg
bio probably pulled me tf up,btohqsg
pass for me cuz i was getting single digits,btohqsg
Sciences and maths easier to score,btohqsg
thanks ah single digits jump to a by o’s abit,btohqsg
Yall i didnt prepaee for eng o level lmao,btohqsg
I treat u all max 4 to basketball session after O levels or a levels. 😂,btohqsg
Shift one alr started i think,btohqsg
Y u copy my ig status for ur WA,btohqsg
Flattery is the highest form of imitation,btohqsg
Does anyone have  Olympiad sample papers? Looking for sci and math ones .-.,btohqsg
singapore olympiad papers r hard to find,btohqsg
Year 6 in IB bio and math,btohqsg
My teacher took 1hr teaching us displacement of metals,btohqsg
She taught us the main idea for the first 10 min then the rest of the time you would see 30 heads on the table,btohqsg
Somemore got aircon in class cuz only all sec 4 classes have,btohqsg

Not many schs do planning for it,btohqsg
Organic synthesis planning is literal free marks,btohqsg
Only way ppl will lose marks if their steps too layman,btohqsg
Hahahahahahaha ull see in reddit thread i guess,btohqsg
To ____cm^3 of solution  add a few drops of ____,btohqsg
Yalah but id assume its a bit more complex than that,btohqsg
I don't even know what they testing,btohqsg
There's no accuracy mark in the entire paper,btohqsg
Id assume is to phenol first then nitro benzene,btohqsg
Wah hahahah idk whag they testing then,btohqsg
We suppose to do 4 titration,btohqsg
And fake the last two HAHAHA,btohqsg
I was about to type this,btohqsg
They ask us to do tollen,btohqsg
But I didn't even do tollen,btohqsg
Cos they gave us the formula,btohqsg
And they tell us the last one positive test for tollen,btohqsg
I mean sometimes give doesnt mean is helpful,btohqsg
So the other one must be ketone,btohqsg
Den first one confirm have to be acid,btohqsg
Epoxide Not in syallbus la haha,btohqsg
Epoxide came out for my exam in p2,btohqsg
My friend say RI spot the entire Qn2,btohqsg
Im dying at linear algebra of ODEs,btohqsg
They have some secret deal with Cambridge,btohqsg
So planning is about synthesis of nitrobenzene?,btohqsg
But they gave the result for like half of them,btohqsg
Only need to do the other half,btohqsg
Yes  they gave result for propanal,btohqsg
As in they gave positive result for tollen test,btohqsg

hello so i was wondering poly courses doesn't actually determine your future uni course if u manage to get into uni?,btohqsg
like i can take up financial information tech in poly and end up with a computer science degree or something related to cybersecurity?,btohqsg
I believe uni courses have a list of eligible poly courses,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionCan u delete this message pls,btohqsg
Random people keep replying to it,btohqsg
Maybe delete all the quizarium ones too,btohqsg
infocomm security management and cybersecurity and digital forensics difference? anyone knows?,btohqsg
(Sorry for sending a long message again)Depends on what course you're studying now in poly and what you're going to study in universityI think is like let say you're studying any course related to infocomm in poly but you want to study any course that related to chemistry in university (by the way  in university  chemistry becomes physics)  might be a big (or even huge) gap for you to catch up because of different schools (like in poly  you're in school of infocomm technology)   but in university  you want to study a course in school of applied science  definitely should be a huge gap)My friends who are studying in university now said that university is a very fast pace  unlike polytechnic. I attended a lesson about IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) last year  like about how to name the organic compounds. There are many things needed to be covered by within one lesson before class test. My classmates and I had to learn how to name 12 types of organic compound  properties of different types of alcohols and ester within one lesson before class quiz. Many of my classmates found hard to understand within one lesson.So  imagine studying chemistry modules in university  might be even harder to catch up if you were from another course in poly.But  if you studied a course in school of infocomm technology in polytechnic and you want to study another course in university (also in school of infocomm technology)  I think shouldn't be a huge gap for you to catch up.So  I think you have to do research before you decide what course you want to study in university.,btohqsg
i appreciate the message alot 😊  does it mean as long as I hit that course's requirement for the gpa blah blah i can get it?,btohqsg
"I think it also depends on how many activities you have participated.Like my facilitator told me that in poly  we shouldn't just focus on the academic. We should also try to participate as many activities as possible or at least join a CCA (in poly  we called it ""Interest Group"") because they will be reflected on our resume. So  even if you reached the course's GPA requirement  the professors might not accept you  if you didn't participate any activities.The professors in universities had announced that they won't look at our O level results anymore. However  I still think that they would still want to see our results  especially if you're from another course in different school (e.g. you were in school of infocomm technology in poly but you want to study a course in school of applied science in university)  based on your background studies  to see if you really can catch up the course that you want to study in university.",btohqsg
thank you so much!!! cleared a lot of doubts!! appreciate a lot 😊,btohqsg
You're welcomeAll the best for your studies 😊,btohqsg
Oh yeahSpeaking of polytechnic and universityIs anyone here from Nanyang Polytechnic or is anyone wanting to go to Nanyang Polytechnic and wants to university once graduated from Nanyang Polytechnic?I am asking this because my friends who are in university now told me that they did not learn how to write a proper report when they studied in Nanyang Polytechnic and I think they have to figure out on their own on how to write a proper report in university  and they're still struggling with it (the report in polytechnic / university is not like what you've learnt in primary and secondary schools).If anyone is interest on how to write a proper report  can pm me,btohqsg
i don't ever rmb learning how to write a report,btohqsg
Ask for template from ur supervisor,btohqsg
Report writing in uni usually depend on what ur prof wants,btohqsg
You learn before but sometimes need to relearn,btohqsg
Hello  just a random one. do anyone here have their ears pierced ? Just curious where to get it pierced. Thanks thanks,btohqsg
Might I add to the same convo I want my cartilege pierced how much does it hurt 🥺,btohqsg
So uh how hard is it to get A for pw,btohqsg
My friend who presented quite well and did alot of work for PW got B,btohqsg
I thinj there is a cao,btohqsg
On how many A a school can have,btohqsg
Also Ur own sch grade Ur own PW,btohqsg
Not very  especially for the OP part which I assume ur going to have soon; just make sure u know ur script very very well and add presenting skills,btohqsg
Cannot be whole school A mah,btohqsg
Nope during my presentation I had 2 groups of external moderators,btohqsg
No the external mods come in  film your presentation  and decide on a grade for you and your school will grade the others based on that,btohqsg
My one only got 2 examiner,btohqsg
But some other groups have more teacher,btohqsg
Most ppl get only 2 ppl,btohqsg
Some suay ones get up to 6,btohqsg
Yea for some groups is internal examiner  but the standard is decided by the groups that are externally moderated,btohqsg
No la thats not true also,btohqsg
Regardless of internal/external examiners for op,btohqsg
Ur overall score is externally moderated,btohqsg
If suey suey they choose the good groups as standard,btohqsg
Den all the others gg sia,btohqsg
I only heard from my pw teacher everything mark by own school teacher,btohqsg
No la if they chose a good group  the group will get A  but it doesn’t mean everyone else cannot get A,btohqsg
So technically the grade decide by the sch?🤷‍♂,btohqsg
I think no matter how they moderate if you have a good presentation you’ll be fine,btohqsg
That's the issue  I remember Anderson distinction rate were damn low,btohqsg
Like the entire class only have like 1-2 distincrion,btohqsg
Look at the marking rubrics and drag  randos to listen to your presentation,btohqsg
My friend who present way better than me  English A1 since sec 1,btohqsg
For my school there are classes with only 1-2 B and the rest A and classes where only 1-2 groups get A,btohqsg
That's why I feel has to due to the sch,btohqsg
I mean even if u get B  there’s all the other papers next year that will have a larger impact on your overall grades so,btohqsg
Besides maybe this year they’ll be more lenient cos the covid thing might’ve affected whether you can practice more as a group (idk cos I didn’t take pw this year),btohqsg
Thats a 180 on what the other guy said haha,btohqsg
SEAB people coming in to watch your OP and film it for external moderation,btohqsg
Only happens to like 1 out of the 10-20 + group per session,btohqsg
Wonder if theyre doing it this year,btohqsg
They prob just send a vid,btohqsg
Anyways my wr need submit monday,btohqsg
that’s better actually  less people you have to maintain eye contact with,btohqsg
And im panic clesning my wr,btohqsg
Wait whaaaat when I did my pw it was submitted in mid September,btohqsg
Yeah but dont we still have the actual op where there will be a few of your teachers there,btohqsg
I think diff sch have diff deadlines,btohqsg
My friend had to submit yesterday i think,btohqsg
And my group act like they dw an A,btohqsg
So i got no choice but to clean up their mess,btohqsg
Just make sure every single topic is linked back to answering the main question ig  add bullshit phrases to make it link more,btohqsg
And OP is 40% and graded individually so don’t worry so much,btohqsg
Oh do you have any qna advice,btohqsg
Hello guys for geo right accuracy is instruments and reliability is data right,btohqsg
I wanna find a FM kid,btohqsg
He just means fysics and maths,btohqsg
I have to go back to school for a sht outing,btohqsg
Can’t the teachers GIVE ME A FKING REST,btohqsg
I WANT TO PLAY ALL DAY T_T,btohqsg
So u took N levels this year la,btohqsg
this is probably true  check the pecentages,btohqsg
