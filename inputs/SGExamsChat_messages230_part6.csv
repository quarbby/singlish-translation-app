Nice  I shall try that once the opportunity arises.,btohqsg
Oh fyi you can customise burgers in macs but,btohqsg
Yes  I do that all the time,btohqsg
I don't recommend cuz the outlet will hate u,btohqsg
I remember the meme of an order of a burger with no meat but just bread.,btohqsg
Depends on u what u order,btohqsg
I mean u can request example like this,btohqsg
is it possible to add like uh for example big mac sauce in a mcchicken,btohqsg
Filet fish + mchicken sauce + Tatar + vegs,btohqsg
but for custom orders must order in-person ah,btohqsg
like not at the self service,btohqsg
I do that to my outlet every time :>,btohqsg
And they make me do my own burgers,btohqsg
Well if they hate I ain't gonna give them their schedule,btohqsg
