hi  i am using CPF OA to invest for endowus. is there a diff btwn the different banks in terms of the fees etc?,btohqsg
I think overall cheapest is UOB but only marginally,btohqsg

Hello for beginner  any gd recommendation for user friendly broker? Hope to invest mainly in US stock.Saxo  Tiger  MooMoo  Interactive Broker or Webull? Looking for lowest broker costs-commission  spread margin  platform  order fee etc. Tku vm üôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
Ibkr. The fx spread u save will more than make up the comm free tradings by the other chinese brokers,btohqsg
Depends on the underlying funds invested via endowus. And diff ppl who invest for diff period would probably tell u diff experience. anyway  dont think u sld compare the returns of the almost risk free OA to risky assets.,btohqsg
We need to know these funds are not capital guaranteed hence that is why they are willing to give you more returns.,btohqsg
In the long run (we're talking periods of 10 years or more)  you're very likely to beat annualised 2.5% if investing in equities (or even some kinds of fixed income). But then you will also need to have the stomach to hold on when your investment portfolio drops 10-20%  and you know that you could have been getting a guaranteed 2.5% instead,btohqsg
