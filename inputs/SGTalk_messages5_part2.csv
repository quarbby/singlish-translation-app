Guys if sorethroat and a bit cough go doc will kena swap test?,btohqsg
🎆 Here are the 10 places across Singapore where you can catch#NDP2020fireworks this Sunday:https://cna.asia/31qgmrp,btohqsg
No mention of the exact locations of the places stated. Or just look up in the skies on that day ok?  😂,btohqsg
don't do hanky panky business da dey.,btohqsg
Likely. Two weeks ago I went to polyclinic because of cough and sore throat. Based on symptoms they immediately put me into the separate zone for ppl with respiratory symptoms. Saw the doctor and she said based on guidelines they have to do a swab test. Went to another room to do it. Then ave to stay home until the negative result comes out 2 days later.But not all doctors can do swabs. If your GP doesn’t  then possible you won’t,btohqsg
Can check here if your GP does swabs. Not sure if you can refuse if GP asks you to go to a swabbing centerhttps://www.flugowhere.gov.sg,btohqsg
