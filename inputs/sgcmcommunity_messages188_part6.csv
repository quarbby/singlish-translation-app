The main problem is everyone drive at the same time. Erp didnt solve the issue,btohqsg
"""Rental companies tout PHVs as a route to car ownership"" this is the problem",btohqsg
Even if the COE continues to be sky high   people will still buy new cars . Sg citizen likes to grumble then after awhile feeling better   will start to buy high again,btohqsg
I wonder they got so much money to bid and DP meh sometimes,btohqsg
Register a pte car under commercial insurance is already conflicting. Just hope that govt dun put phv under cat C ü§£,btohqsg
Or opts for 100% payment .,btohqsg
Many People live day by day,btohqsg
Given most Singaporean's mindset where every dollar must have a return  a phv that is privately owned doesn't work,btohqsg
Bankruptcy rates in Singapore is growing . I read last week that.,btohqsg
Another contributing factor is 0% down,btohqsg
No  vehicles to be registered as phv should not compete with pte car coe,btohqsg
Just make it more expensive to drive.,btohqsg
Those driving phv should tax them more .,btohqsg
Lol erp is only to help govt generate income ü§£,btohqsg
But during erp timing ppl supposed to plan their route,btohqsg
People like me should have more subsidized in owningcars.helpto increase the birth rate for Singapore .,btohqsg
I think most who can't afford coe would just hog car sharing vehicles by booking long timing,btohqsg
Lol no lo  having a car doesn't boost birth rates. Car doesn't help you babysit leh,btohqsg
Maybe they should come out with each birth rate ; provide subsidies of $15k each . I got 5 now . So that is 75k and 3 more on the way -$15k .,btohqsg
Going out with kids without a vehicle is a chore .,btohqsg
Maybe this will help to increase the birth rate in Singapore .,btohqsg
Many people also says that raising a family without a vehicle is also another form of chores.,btohqsg
The 30/40 dp is meant to control ppl not to overload on their debts,btohqsg
I think they should fix the downpayment to 60/70% instead .,btohqsg
ü§£ no no  its a chore because nobody to help them  transport is only part of the problem,btohqsg
Penalty to those financial services that provide lower downpayment .,btohqsg
Drive down coe prices  not drive out businesses ü§£,btohqsg
For me   I really need car for the children . 5 kids with 5 strollers . Everytime we went out .,btohqsg
