Wheelchair uncle make everyone late for work,btohqsg
Not referring to sg population. Referring to drivers population.,btohqsg
Iirc  lta had planned to implement more bus-only lanes rather than expanding the number of bus lanes like the one at Bencoolen St.,btohqsg
Drivers don’t just drive themselves around. They drive for their family members.,btohqsg
Maybe that works better and get people to be on work on time.,btohqsg
Take a moment to read if you're interested in the Bus-Only lanes plans fro LTA  David,btohqsg
Or maybe Govt may enforce a compulsory wfh practices on all co. Lol. Then less cars will be needed on the road. 😂😂😂,btohqsg
Less likely.. unless another wave of pandemic happens..,btohqsg
This a very simple view. While it's true that some drivers transport family members  the reality is that the majority of car trips r for own use. Ur argument ignores the fact that if more people took buses instead of driving  it would dramatically reduce the no of vehicles on the road  reduce congestion significantly.1 bus can replace dozens of cars  n even a slight increase in public transport use can lead to major reduction in traffic. The misconception that every driver is a family chauffeur underestimates the no of cars contributing to congestion daily. If more ppl used public transport  the positive ripple effect on traffic will be substantial. I think ur perspective is dangerously out of touch with urban transportation realities,btohqsg
I agree that one bus can replace a lot of cars. But it should not be at the expenses of others who need it for the family than those who can afford it. Hence  disagreeing the fact that COE need to be higher.I’m coming from the angle of family needs than personal wants than from a view where only the rich can afford to drive.If there’s a separate category for that  then that’s fine. People can submit application to justify their needs for a car. While those who are rich to pay for a 1m COE can go ahead to buy their Toyota Vios with 1m COE. 😂,btohqsg
I think give family cheaper coe will create unfair system  giving special treatment based on family status n undermining the principle of equality. Car ownership is a luxury  not pampering family with cheaper coe,btohqsg
Try selling ev after 2 years. Will lose like mad,btohqsg
Anyone car plate marker recommended in West area ?,btohqsg
The action starts 10-15mins before bidding ends,btohqsg

With the July-August National Day crazy promotion tht just ended,btohqsg

It really huge compared to my vezel,btohqsg
Wait n c after 5 years,btohqsg
If not much complain will buy,btohqsg
I still prefer the Dolphin. Atto could be just too big for me,btohqsg
Then what about the (pre 2021) Vezel/HRV?,btohqsg
Vios a bit too late to buy liao la. Chances are the used market has a lot of sketchy examples of previous owners not taking good care of it. If buy  consider buying COE for it in the near future. Most newer Vios are more than 5 years oldI don't really need the car that much unless it's to transport heavy load or drive to hard to reach spots such as Dempsey Road or Changi Jetty/Tanah Merah Coast Road,btohqsg
When I bought is monkey see money do,btohqsg
If u manage to try a few SUV u prefer vezel,btohqsg
Most Malaysian owned few cars  not sporean,btohqsg
If I stayed in msia sure no such thing as choose 1 car,btohqsg
It's just cheaper that's all. Try setting the price to 250k or above and see if it's most popular lo,btohqsg

Uk i quite happy when i see coe up then see all the cars stuck. Force dealer to bring down price,btohqsg
Nothing to do with greedy  just look at the backlogs,btohqsg
Non guranteed for Kah Motor at $85k,btohqsg
Just abt to reach non guranteed thrashhold,btohqsg
They have a few bids anyway,btohqsg
So another batch of ppl cannot get car,btohqsg
Even if this round can't  there's next round until maybe what  6bids?,btohqsg
So for next quarter govt increase quota also no use,btohqsg
Increas quota to clear backlog nia,btohqsg
Cos if no increase  bank no money to loan,btohqsg
Cat A bid like much lesser liao,btohqsg
might climb to 100k sia at this rate,btohqsg
COE won’t drop and instead it shoot up. If COE price increase  all the used car prices also increased. I don’t think any car dealers will lower their price. 😅,btohqsg
Ah 1 bid guaranteed. Eurokars earlier this year gave guaranteed coe but 8 bids  while non-guaranteed is 6,btohqsg
They only make money if it goes up. Extreme drops very tough for them,btohqsg
