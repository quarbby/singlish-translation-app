Hi all  are there any instances where buying these new 10 yr COE luxury sedan cars are actually better than normal sedan? Foresee more problems with the car in the next 10 years?,btohqsg
Worst case bro u overhaul engine n gb total extra 10k can drive another 10 years. $2.73 per day assuming u drive to last day,btohqsg
I think only price  never the condition,btohqsg
it will definitely be higher cost than buying coe toyota / honda but if u pick the right unit and take care of it well it can also last  but prepare ur pockets for unexpected costs,btohqsg
And take a look at the road for conti wise  a lot of older mercs but not common to see older bmw / audi nowadays,btohqsg
