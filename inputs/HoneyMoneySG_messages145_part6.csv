https://www.cpf.gov.sg/service/article/when-is-the-best-time-to-top-up-to-grow-my-savings#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20you%20can%20earn%20more top%2Dups%20in%2010%20years.When to top up our cpf SA?According to cpf best top up in Jan ? Or we top up in December this month,btohqsg
You still got tax relief to get from RSTU/VCMA for this year?,btohqsg
Or top up in Jan next 2025 ?,btohqsg
Have u topped up this year?,btohqsg
Top up last December last year,btohqsg
If you want to reduce tax this year  then do it this year. Topping up in Jan will be counted for next year tax reduction.,btohqsg
But why cpf say Jan top up better?,btohqsg
Best is top up on last few days of the month. As interest is counted on first of the month on lower value.,btohqsg
Hi all  should I top up SA or SRS? I am in mid 30s. I am still wondering which one better ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
to earn 'more' interest... their perspective is different..January 2025 vs December 2025we are comparing December 2024 and January 2025,btohqsg
See whether u good in investment or not. If good then srs. If not good then sa.,btohqsg
Sa can't take out lor so consider not wise until u later in life plus u still young,btohqsg
i have differing viewif you do own investments  you should not topup SA or SRS since both are trapped moneyyou can use the cash 'outside' to earn more than the tax savings  without any restrictions,btohqsg
Objective is to save tax if high income brackets . ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
my view is SRS isn't worth the tax savings as your money is trapped for too long and while trapped it cannot do anything.,btohqsg
Just different views. Won't say it trap. Just safety buffers for more conservative strategies.,btohqsg
invest in singapore market not much restrictions,btohqsg
See yourself. He is right for his cases. I am right for my cases. No right and wrong one.,btohqsg
gentle reminder that the SRS tax relief is still under the $80k global tax relief...,btohqsg
Assuming topping up is for tax reliefs  picking to RSTU or top-up SRS depends on your need of the money to be liquid.SA will be fully locked up until CPF withdrawal age.SRS will be locked up until SRS withdrawal age  but can be withdrawn anytime before with penalties.,btohqsg
To give some context  a female with 2 kids  and earning $150 000 assessable income will no longer have any use for Tax Relief schemes like Topping up CPF or SRS.,btohqsg
Depends also  the amounts charged at 7% maybe still able to beat easily  but amounts charged from 11.5% onwards  it's a sure way to reduce taxes  and still know the monies are yours (and earning 4% p.a. interest if SA  or 7-11% p.a. interest if invested SRS).,btohqsg
even if on 22% and above tax bracket.. the money is locked for say 20 years..you just need to beat SRS investments by 2% consistently can liao.,btohqsg
https://www.salary.sg/2009/whats-not-good-about-supplementary-retirement-scheme-srs/this is an old article but still somewhat in line with my thinking...the 'one off' tax savings isn't worth the tens of years lockin,btohqsg
FYI: This article was written in 2009 before lower cost platforms and digital advisors come to Singapore,btohqsg
yeah i guess the 'opportunity cost' might have been lowered..but the principle of the tax savings needing to be divided by the number of years of lock in remain.,btohqsg
Anyone else having issues getting into chocolate finance app?,btohqsg
Try using your mobile data instead of wifi. I have problem log in using wifi.,btohqsg
Whether to do SRS is situational dependent. No right or wrong each person have to assess for themself.,btohqsg
This question like every week someone will ask ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Everyone scared CF will suddenly run away with their money,btohqsg
"I mean they can't really run off with the money  but imagine top-up promotional period over and suddenly the fund ""drops in price"" ðŸ™Š",btohqsg
Most ppl would have withdrawn out everything by the last day of the top-up programme if its not extended ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
What if their downtime was 2 days before end of programme until a week later ðŸ™ˆ,btohqsg
Tat would be a massive conspiracy,btohqsg
i wonder if anyone remember the RXX 6%+ p.a. EIR savings promo they ran 1-2 years ago.There really was a conspiracy to shutdown the online platform as they ran out of free float to facilitate the one day transfer out before people moved back in the next day.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if shopback pay transactions using DBS WMCC are considered qualifying transactions for 4mpd?,btohqsg
Yes  shopback transactions are online transactions.,btohqsg
Any idea which platform has the best exchange rate to transfer money from SG to Malaysia bank? I check Yahoo rate is $3.304 today  Dash quotes $3.289. Any other better exchange rate?,btohqsg
Hi anyone managed to successfully appeal for UOB one card minimum spend?,btohqsg
yes it is possible.. once per year you appeal they should approve..then you just need to make up the additional spend next month,btohqsg
My srs are all invested into local banks... Tax savings of 10+%  and it gives me dividend yield of 5+%  with capital appreciation. Why not?!,btohqsg
you can do the same with cash outside SRS..and yes the only difference is you don't get the ONE OFF tax savings of as you say 10%+but you have so much more flexibility with the cash outside SRS. Profits you can take out and buy another house immediately for example,btohqsg
Agree  but I see it as local banks being part of my portfolio  so instead of using cash  I'm using srs. But srs needs to be built up slowly while using cash  I can buy one shot at once. So I agree on the flexibity.,btohqsg
Hello anybody familiar with the Kris Flyer UOB account on the terms and condition The part where it says incremental funds thingy.Does it mean every month need to make sure the balance is higher ?,btohqsg
Usually bank minimum spend count transaction date or posting date?,btohqsg
