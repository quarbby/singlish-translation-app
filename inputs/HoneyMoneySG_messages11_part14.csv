naise. i m going australia with it. thanks man. just want check for e-sim i just need to off my own data or remove my sim?,btohqsg
Don’t have to remove SIM. If you’re using iPhone it’s much simpler. Purchase and download the pack in SG. Activate before you board and when you arrive  switch off airplane mode and it will toggle. Make sure your primary SIM card “data roaming” is off,btohqsg
