Go JB buy cheaper and can retire there,btohqsg
If u buy to stay then it's alright since melbourne is a good city to live in.. but if for investment purposes  I would say the crisis not over yet  seeing a lot of listed property for rent at lower rent,btohqsg
Now not the time to buy big investment items lah,btohqsg

Have u tried living there before? 2BR at decent places are renting at below 600 per week.. u can try staying for a while before deciding whether to buy,btohqsg
Exactly.. wonder how this is not worse than smuggling drugs which usually leads to death sentence undisputed,btohqsg
i stayed two month in docklands last year November to new year. the weather is shiok and pace is really slow.. only thing is prices very high la..,btohqsg
600 per week = 2400 per month  not cheap lei,btohqsg
