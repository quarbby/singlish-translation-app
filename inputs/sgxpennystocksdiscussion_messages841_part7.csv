Equity markets continued to plunge further and SPY gains faded in the afternoon session.There will be a support at 424.We are still holding our positions to tide over this volatile period and expects more risk to come as discussed earlier. This means our sub-ibkr has entered into negative return (probably will top up some capital when needed) since set up on 5 June.The weakness may spillover into October as more Fed officials reinforced the notion of higher for longer in terms of fed fund rate. That mantra will put a lid on equity markets to recover.Have a splendid weekend and the we shall enter into the final September trading week.Pika Nat.,btohqsg

Nowadays less than 10k also boost.....used to be 20-30k orders for new EV launched just few years back.,btohqsg
Xpeng is slowly losing its edge. That's why. The deal with VW will probably help. LI has been selling well. I've seen a lot more of them on the roads.,btohqsg
