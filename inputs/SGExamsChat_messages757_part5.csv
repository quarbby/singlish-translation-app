doesn't really matter at an academic level but can be q impt practically,btohqsg
I realise my poly  your cumulative rise .2 gpa everytime you get .6 in your semester gpa,btohqsg
ya HAHAHA or even like small little things like your school event the planning committees all wearing same shirt vs anyhow whack,btohqsg
nah brand image is your branding,btohqsg
i too long never do biz alr,btohqsg
like say sgexams  u see the logo  u know is sgexams,btohqsg
alr transitioned to health sci side of things,btohqsg
So if I get 1.8  to hit 2.0…I have to get 2.6gpa. And I did that.So now if I want to hit 3.0  I have to hit 3.6 for my graded internship,btohqsg
u see sgexams  u know thrs the tele groups  reddit  discord  etc,btohqsg
what ppl think of when u see the brand name/logo,btohqsg
or like searching stuff  we now just say Google it,btohqsg
Tell me u failed math without telling me u failed math,btohqsg
When you apply for uni  the piriority is cumulative not semester,btohqsg
3.6 for a internship is mad insane,btohqsg
Someone help me do math for this,btohqsg
What kinda regarded shit is this bro,btohqsg
Is cumulative gpa not a avg gpa of all ur sems,btohqsg
Dude everyone knows that but ryan ah saying,btohqsg
Your maths won’t give you the exact cumulative you see but will be Close (likely a round up or round down scenario),btohqsg
So instead of 2.2 showing  you may get a 2.0,btohqsg
but anyway in case yall need^,btohqsg
dude u know how calculate exact gpa down to .01???,btohqsg
no clue bc i nvr took masters but that one has a lot of adult learners and stuff too,btohqsg
i know how cumulative gpa works but i’m not bothering to pick apart his math lol,btohqsg
So its wrong ah and im not crazy,btohqsg
This is my individual gpa after 4 sems,btohqsg
in sg it’s 4 years. number of years vary by country and uni,btohqsg
how did u get less than 2 gpa in poly,btohqsg
This is what i should have seen if it went by maths  but I say 2.0 on my cumulative,btohqsg
the worst dude i heard in my time get 2 at least,btohqsg
U wanna do academia  or like quant,btohqsg
1.47 gpa in my poly Means you just pass all your modules,btohqsg
ideally academia but i’m looking into quant stuff yea,btohqsg
Just pass in terms of D,btohqsg
I dont remember rp giving exact gpa for each sems leh,btohqsg
probs get an intern before my final year,btohqsg
Care to enlighten how u find exact gpa for each sem,btohqsg
can is can but it’s a fierce competition yk,btohqsg
They will show in your student portal,btohqsg
Might as well go S&T since I'm in consulting now,btohqsg
i dont think just aiming for a pass is good enough but its ok u do u,btohqsg
is calculating gpa rly so hard that we need to have an in depth  detailed discussion about how to calculate gpa,btohqsg
Need take laptop for this sht,btohqsg
not like you're at 3.34 and you need 3.5 so you dont get abused so u need calculate how much u need to get,btohqsg
The 1.8 to 2.6 jump should tell you I’m not aiming for pass  it’s my skill issue at play here,btohqsg
i wld be more concerned about studying than calculating gpa,btohqsg
1.8 to 2.6 in one sem…that’s y2 sem 1 and y2 sem 2,btohqsg
me when i realised how much id need to maintain first class after i SUed two mods that id have gotten A for,btohqsg
Yea If your poly don’t anyhow grade the students…but not my poly,btohqsg
well 1.9 and 2.0 doesn't make that much of a difference ngl,btohqsg
