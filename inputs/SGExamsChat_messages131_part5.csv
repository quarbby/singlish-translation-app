hi guys  im doing a recycling project and i need to find unwanted clothes. we tried donation drive in school but no one donated. Does anyone know where to buy cheap unwanted clothes  eg denim and etc?,btohqsg
U can bulk buy from those ‚Äúinfluenzers‚Äù,btohqsg
just google thrift shops or sth,btohqsg
‚ÄúI believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can¬†learn to let go  things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they‚Äôre right  you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself  and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.‚Äù,btohqsg
2 months cow go home liao  nvm I will think of some ways,btohqsg
Yeah just go karang guni in ur block,btohqsg

Or... you can look in your closet  there are bound to be some clothes you‚Äôll never wear again  just too attached to part with it. Take it out  say thank you to it  then make it into something that sparks joy again.,btohqsg

If you do badly you have no one else to blame but yourself,btohqsg
Everyone is chionging their asses off,btohqsg
Except for self proclaimed 'everyday play Maple also can do well in JC' people,btohqsg
Ur A Level results can influence wat path ur life takes,btohqsg
Ok let me put it another way,btohqsg
Ur A Levels results can open more doors for u depending on how well y do,btohqsg
R u in jc or sec sch,btohqsg
As a person who graduated JC  I agree. Especially for Aptitude based admission  you need to get probably 60  if not higher enough (because of competition) to attain a place PLUS your own cca cert.,btohqsg
Tbhhhhh not really  A levels set you on a singular path anyways. You are going to uni regardless. Just depends WHICH uni,btohqsg
Id say your path was already set in stone after o levels and the JC/Poly split. Thats makes a greater difference,btohqsg
Plenty of time in NS to do that,btohqsg
