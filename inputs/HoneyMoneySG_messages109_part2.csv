Hi guys need your advice until now Iâ€™m trying to apply for a credits card from various bank and is unsuccessful.What should I do to get a credit card?,btohqsg
the easiest way is using Secured Fixed Deposit way.have you shared your profile with us before?NationalityJobApprox salaryStatus of your relationship with Singapore,btohqsg
Why unsuccessful....I also unsuccessful with ocbc bank apply 2 times... all rejected..Only foreign bank   dbs   uob accept me.Only in March ocbc then accept me,btohqsg
Seriously bro...Ocbc is the most strict among all other banks,btohqsg
Profile as in here?Nationality - SGJob- warehousingApprox salary - 2 200,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve tried like POSB   ocbc  UOB & trust card all decline,btohqsg
oh bro.. if $2200 x 12 = $26 400. That is below the $30k MAS requirement..,btohqsg
Just realised you edited the amount ðŸ˜‚Like that best is FD secured card with bank,btohqsg
Yes. Secured is easiest .Some bank required min 10k.I heard for solitaire lady card require 30k then can,btohqsg
What is the best option?1. I go to the bank and ask for the FD secured card ?Or2. I do it online   put in 10k in FD and apply for a credit card ?,btohqsg
Can I know what is considered foreign bank?,btohqsg
U need to go bank sign a form to use the FD as collateral based on what I know for UOB.And interest rates usually not good. So do consider whatâ€™s best for you.,btohqsg
Yes I did the same too. FD 10k sgd as collateral.,btohqsg
What if they make both fee waiver and card cancellation difficult because of poor customer service? ðŸŒš,btohqsg
Basically beside 3 local bank  all remaining is foreign entity that open here lah,btohqsg
Citibank Singapore Limited will be so sad to hear this....,btohqsg
Foreign entity can open sg limited  aus limited  my limited  look at parent company,btohqsg
Just like when people mention the australia big 4 bank same,btohqsg
Citibank singapore is a subsidiary of citibank america of course,btohqsg
I forget about scb. Because their redemption rate to miles is poor,btohqsg
Boc and icbc basically they are poor in miles... never mind. Hsbc also part of China now... revolution  and travel 1 card. I believe will continue to be strong,btohqsg
Why is it related to miles all of a sudden,btohqsg
What are you getting at talking about China out of the blue lol,btohqsg
Icbc don't have miles   previously there is promotion for boc . Need to spend certain amount cash in SQ to get the miles,btohqsg
Whatâ€™s the link between miles and bank locations?,btohqsg
Does anyone have a good system to track when their card will be charged for annual fees?,btohqsg

Then how is it related to miles?,btohqsg
This depends on the card what the bank offers,btohqsg
Anyway all those who want to jump in may snack challenge rmb to do so within this few day to enjoy the monthly dividend.,btohqsg
Hahaha so a bank is foreign and miles is related?,btohqsg
Hopefully their customer service improves after Tin Pei Ling joined.,btohqsg
