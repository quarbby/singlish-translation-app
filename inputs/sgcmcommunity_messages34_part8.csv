Can’t wait to test drive Peugeot 3008,btohqsg
Reviews mentioned that it’s quite powerful despite the 3 cylinder,btohqsg
see the audi a3 1.0 broo HAHAHHA,btohqsg
GR Yaris also 3 cyl but so powerful,btohqsg
Can’t find on sgcarmart new car,btohqsg
Different.This one is Gazoo Racing 😂,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/sXPuLdRuEQsMostly because Europe wanna cut emissions. So inline 3 definitely better.Cut cost of manufacturingBut in Singapore context paying 160-190k for inline 3..It suppose to cut cost.,btohqsg
i am shocked confused and amazed,btohqsg
Nobody wants old volvo. Much hated,btohqsg
You don’t see people destroy Mazdas  do you? 😉,btohqsg

That’s the stock image that was listed with the ad tho🤔,btohqsg
The ad have info on the SVR also,btohqsg
That's why they used it I guess,btohqsg
u got see car come w base model image meh haha,btohqsg
if so then i think 911 coming with steelies already,btohqsg
Always have the mid to higher tier model on display as well,btohqsg
Then they just point out what you will miss out on,btohqsg
Usually a good way to convince some people to spend a bit more on a higher trim level. Obviously in this case whole different car because of powertrain but the interior not that much different apart from seat shape and materials,btohqsg
Which can be optioned on the regular f-pace as well,btohqsg
Key difference would be the powertrain and suspension,btohqsg
And some standard options that aren't standard on the 2.0,btohqsg
Must set driver's seat and passenger seat to your position,btohqsg
That's usually how I test legroom,btohqsg
I don’t mind Volvo 24X wor,btohqsg
As I'm of a decent height so can do that.,btohqsg
Model 3  C-Class and 3 Series all very small to me haha,btohqsg
so high demand but the owners all dont want to sell😂😂,btohqsg
wow looks like the alfa stelvio q4,btohqsg
Mr Xun is more concerned about space for his furry friends than space for himself,btohqsg
Okay how to determine whether the car the big enough. U set ur front seat to be comfortable and see if u can sit directly behind,btohqsg
frankly for model 3 and C-Class its impossible,btohqsg
I agree Mr Xun! Best way is to do it like that,btohqsg
I personally follow that method as well,btohqsg
i do have slightly longer legs so that contributes to it being uncomfortable,btohqsg
What car is a no no for you?,btohqsg
before i bought my XC40  cnc wanted to sell me a C200 Night edition for 170k but the biggest turn of was the rear seats,btohqsg
C-class still ok as most Mercedes models nowadays have rear seats reclined at an angle and enough space in the back as they tend to be slightly longer,btohqsg
I'm MPV lover 😂👍2 large dog middle seat2 large dog third roll seat fold up.No problems 😁,btohqsg
A4 also ok  3 series a bit more cramped. I personally am not a fan of the rear seats on the X1  X3 and 3 series as well. A bit too hard and flat for me,btohqsg
I became an odyssey lover last weekend,btohqsg
can hide the third row and have huge space for activities,btohqsg
Competitors offer more comfy rear seats but that's also to do with BMWs focus on driver pleasure,btohqsg
You tried the Stepwagon/ Toyota Noah?I fit entire baby crib behind and few boxes when moving to new house😂,btohqsg
Nope haha will check it out this weekend😂😂,btohqsg
Im still missing the big ol XC90...When i look at the cars now  all i see is a glimpse of my old XC90,btohqsg
Xc 90 is big need compare with fat boy x,btohqsg
