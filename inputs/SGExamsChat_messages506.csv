wasn't there a case where a woman was sentenced to jail for killing 8 boys,btohqsg

Someone like kira(deathnote) would be a godsend,btohqsg

hey guys what do u think can be done to resolve the issue of crowdedness in public transport ?,btohqsg
this is for my pw project !!,btohqsg
go send me offer only now then say got some party on 13th may (in 2 fking days) and have to accept offer by 24th May,btohqsg
like bro NTU's attitude towards us is way better,btohqsg
thanos snap half of them away,btohqsg
1-more services during peak hrs/whenits crowded2-refurbish design of public transport to be able to accommodate for a larger capacity (C151/KHI has been refurbished from 9 seats a row to 7 and even removed a few rows of sitting for standing space)3-buy more trains and buses etc. to increase capacity (trains such as the C830C (there are a lot more but i dowan say now) have been bought just to increase capacity of the line)4-use larger vehicles (higher usage of double decker and bendy buses ard singapore)5-create dedicated bus/train services/lines to alleviate pressure on older existing lines (CRL is being built to do that for EWL  lunchtime express used to be there at the city centre along the EWL to cater to the extra crowd during lunch time),btohqsg
plus rejection/acceptance date is pretty much 24th May for everyone  i think,btohqsg
like if u reject till 23rd may but accept 24th  neither will it cost u the seat  nor will the uni allocate another person for it,btohqsg
thats a good view i didn't considwr üëÄ,btohqsg
my new laptop for sch ideh microsoft acc signed into win11,btohqsg
i should be able to use my laptop without the need of a cloud account,btohqsg
and worst part is the office suite is not even free,btohqsg
I thought u can login with sch email,btohqsg
and yes can login with sch mail,btohqsg
Not letting the sch acc get hold of my data,btohqsg
no la. u wouldn‚Äôt want the sch to know too much abt u as well,btohqsg
But regardless sch go acc or not I always wanted to drive a laptop without a Microsoft acc,btohqsg
think out of the box. Reduce population,btohqsg
just get people like that kid that stole the bus to drive,btohqsg
out of the box idea üí™üëç,btohqsg
1. Maintain a 5min  train frequency,btohqsg
Won‚Äôt do much  cause fleet system exist,btohqsg

There is a reason why there is so many taxis on the roads  because commercial vehicles like taxis avoid the whole coe system,btohqsg
im not talking about what can be done to reduce coe. thats for another conversation,btohqsg
we need to make use of air taxis from Pasir Ris to Farrer Hill to Boon Lay  3 stops,btohqsg
But that won‚Äôt improve public transport,btohqsg
More cars= more jams= efficiency of public busses drop,btohqsg
