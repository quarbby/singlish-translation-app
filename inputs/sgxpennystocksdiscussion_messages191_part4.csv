ADDED More VICPLAS 275. TARGET 310. SL 255. Yesterday closed 280 during matching with some one taking more than 130 lots when there was sell down 275 just before. Feels like the players are plotting for higher. Considering that they did a crazy run up 260 to 320 before the 1st Vaccine news medical drop. The BB players are still stucked and looks like good timing to steal the show with their ascending triangle set up üëç,btohqsg
NORDIC go go go lai 1 mouth 255?...,btohqsg
