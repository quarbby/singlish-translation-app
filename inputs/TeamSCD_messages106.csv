The venturi tunnels need to somehow limit their own velocity so it doesn‚Äôt push the car all the way down and cause a stall,btohqsg
Anyone has a reliable spray shop in jp for spraying accesories,btohqsg
Yup  FIA fault... They came out with the regulation,btohqsg
What regulation? U mean they made it mandatory for cars to utilize ground effect?,btohqsg
