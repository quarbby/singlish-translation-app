Hi everyone  for the HSBC Revolution 1k limit for 10x reward points  do transactions count from the 1st to the last day of the month  or are they based on your payment cycle?,btohqsg
based on posted transaction in calendar month,btohqsg
It is base on bidding at each launch,btohqsg
Do you know the estimated interest rate,btohqsg
Currently I am on US TB and the interest rate is very low about 3%,btohqsg
Anyone know when the additional bonus interest for OCBC 360 new account opening may 2024 will be credited?,btohqsg
Today? Have you checked your account?,btohqsg
Tbills using cash averages around 3.6-3.7. You can choose a competitive bidding to indicate the interest rate that you wish to get but it may not be a 100% allocation depending on the rate you indicate,btohqsg
I found out for June promotion the additional bonus will only be credited on the following month. But I not sure about the April promotion,btohqsg
I can’t find the t&c for the April account opening promotion anymore,btohqsg
Competitive bidding is almost always 100% allocation or none depending on the clearing price. However  non-competitive bids may be given an allocation below 100% depending on demand?,btohqsg
Then should be by 15 June.,btohqsg
US you should be getting at least 5% for short dated,btohqsg

Hi guys  regarding moomoo SG cash plus 6.8% welcome reward  wondering if the following is correct:If I were to deposit $80k and subscribe to any of the MMF and hold for 30 days  I'll get the $447.If I were to also execute 3 buy trades and hold for 30 days (subscribe 3x $1 into the same MMF will count as the 3x biy trades)  I will get the $70 reward (deposit $3k criteria is alrdy fulfilled since I deposited $80k hence I do not need to deposit another $3k).If I sign up using the referral link  I'll get another $20 (deposit $100 and execute 1 buy trade is auto fulfilled since I've deposited $80k and executed 3 buy trades  I dont need to deposit another $100 and execute another buy trade).,btohqsg
can i still participate now if i’m existing moomoo user?,btohqsg
