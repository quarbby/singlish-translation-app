the entry salary is so low ü•π,btohqsg
ok it sounds a bit like how NTU has common engineering,btohqsg
engineering in general is low pay one,btohqsg
honestly i wanted try geological engineering but not a lot of uni have sia,btohqsg
but then again engineering is like solid rice bowl  cannot get full cannot get hungry,btohqsg
if u wan legit get rich den go for finance or computer science,btohqsg
the ntu one is you go in  then after a bit you decide what engineering you want,btohqsg
so sad.. can‚Äôt buy bbt everyday ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
although computer science now abit saturated,btohqsg
but it's subject to your grades and demand,btohqsg
ya la so many ppl want to go in,btohqsg
this one seems to be you go into the bachelor of science then you take credits that go into whatever path you want from the list,btohqsg
is like the biomed in early 2000s,btohqsg
i jus choose mec eng coz ik wont starve one,btohqsg
the Australia one is like a cross between that and the US,btohqsg
US is fr decide any major at all but this one is like you have options within the subgroup,btohqsg
for mine is about 14% girls,btohqsg
i think the only course in SIT eng with such high numbers lol,btohqsg
i mean if you know what engineering you wanna do it'd be better to go for it directly bc like i said  going from common engineering is dependent on your sem 1 grades,btohqsg
and the demand of the one you want,btohqsg
ukw atp if i get into any ntu course i‚Äôll just eat it up,btohqsg
go finance if u wan earn big bucks,btohqsg
but my grades might not be good,btohqsg
and i‚Äôm not sg a level,btohqsg
worry about that after getting your results,btohqsg
if they even look at my application i think ill be v happy alr,btohqsg
i mean i did sg a levels v badly so see how ba,btohqsg
my best results came from PSLE and then uni,btohqsg
what was ur results if udm me asking ü•π,btohqsg
Chem: DPhysics: AMath: EGP: BPW: AGeog: D,btohqsg
how tf is that bad üòî,btohqsg
oh no atp maybe no ntu fr me anm,btohqsg
need to start being ok w koalas and spiders ..,btohqsg
how is that not bad ...,btohqsg
my best subjects came from H1,btohqsg
my course in ntu is low cutoff that's why plus,btohqsg
p sure it's still luck that i made it looking at the IGP,btohqsg
i took a test to get in btw,btohqsg
like they called me to come in for it,btohqsg
omg i bet u studied ur ass off,btohqsg
how did u get resources to study for the tests?,btohqsg
not rlly like the test was mainly O level stuff + math capabilities,btohqsg
i also v naughty during a level,btohqsg
now i wake up alr too late üôÇ,btohqsg
i can't vibe with the jc structure,btohqsg
i look at like h2 chem now and if i had half the intuition i had now,btohqsg
maybe js need to bear w consequences and retake again,btohqsg
make sure this time all A,btohqsg
by that logic we r fked no?,btohqsg
bruh i regret ‚ò†Ô∏è why was i so naughty during jc,btohqsg
if the average person isnt an idiot,btohqsg
i had the chance to take sg a levels,btohqsg
its harder for the rest of us to shine thrugh,btohqsg
naughty isnt the word id use,btohqsg
don‚Äôt worry i‚Äôm not active anm üòö,btohqsg
thanks i never thought of that,btohqsg
coz u deal with harder topics already mah,btohqsg
i was v naughty i skip sch i hang out w other naughty ppl i prioritise looks over everything in life,btohqsg
now i regret bc maybe cannot go uni this yr :(,btohqsg
i mean true but even looking at math stuff from uni that's from h2,btohqsg
or maybe it's just being sick of jc as a whole then idw to learn,btohqsg
fr i think maybe js burnout,btohqsg
is it me or i feel uni maths is doable,btohqsg
i think it's actually easier at times bc related stuff are contained within a mod,btohqsg
and i can see how they're useful,btohqsg
i thought its a SIT thing,btohqsg
they relate how vectors and complex number coordinates in maths with statics,btohqsg
btw does ntu care if like i retained dropped out and retook,btohqsg
u dont say how they know,btohqsg
like will they think ‚ÄúüíÄüíÄ shit she‚Äôs like stupid or sth maybe ‚Äú,btohqsg
ntu don't have access to as much of your records as you think,btohqsg
Is there such thing as repeating a year in uni?,btohqsg
not really because it's about finishing your requirements within the max candidature period,btohqsg
Oh that's what they call it?,btohqsg
if you fail mods you gotta retake but,btohqsg
if i rushed i could've finished in 3.5 years,btohqsg
some take 4.5 if they need it,btohqsg
but standard for sg is 4 years,btohqsg
Is that where the student loan/debt comes in or smth üò≠,btohqsg
uh like remod = $ ?,btohqsg
Like how if ur As/Os priv candidate,btohqsg
in sg you pay by the sem,btohqsg
if you can overload a sem to finish in the same number of sems then you pay the same,btohqsg
"unless you take a ""special term"" that's during the holidays",btohqsg
Bro not happy with 9sir i believe,btohqsg
From what i heard from laojiao,btohqsg
9sir better than ur time alr,btohqsg
Cant be bothered lol  i dont even know my ps,btohqsg
The regular there like so onz,btohqsg
i wasnt even talking about him and he suddenly say stfu,btohqsg
idk whats the context but i gotta agree with that guy,btohqsg
i said i agreed with that guy,btohqsg
if u dk the context then how r u agreeing with him,btohqsg

@chemcercan ban this guy from this chat tooüòÅ,btohqsg
who is this bye nigga person,btohqsg
But in the past I would,btohqsg
I had a send to hospital count,btohqsg
Needed to keep my count up,btohqsg
Her parents probably told her to be humble,btohqsg
so that she would be less of a target i guess,btohqsg
Ngl why would anyone openly say they are rich apart from zl,btohqsg
I live 3 story and I can say my parents are rich asl,btohqsg
at least she didn‚Äôt get paid $100 for 7 months,btohqsg
not like people ask me haha,btohqsg
Even when I was back in sec sch,btohqsg
Only ONE person admitted he was rich,btohqsg
Jc also no one admitted they were rich,btohqsg
Oh that one I thought other msg,btohqsg
Whr tf sells 20 dollar waffles,btohqsg
i like the can 2 stuff,btohqsg
but not convenient for me unless i'm at src,btohqsg
next time come my place i can make,btohqsg

At least u didn't need any beverage to swallow it,btohqsg
quad i only ate their ytf,btohqsg
who tf buys 20 dollar waffles,btohqsg
i can buy 4 lunches with 20 dollars,btohqsg
Idk i saw someone mention 20 dollar waffles,btohqsg
i got my perm for fucking 75 dollars and this nigga spent 1k on it,btohqsg
1k can buy straightener or curler and u can perm everyday,btohqsg
1k can buy 10 perms lol,btohqsg
How do you spend 1k to perm hair,btohqsg
u can just buy a curler and get infinite perms,btohqsg
bruh i think we're the only 07s here,btohqsg
i joined because i from disc and he admin here so i just join,btohqsg
your first step of pain is tapping into the mrt gantry with adult fare,btohqsg

so technically speaking  u have no rest days,btohqsg
just message me anything for the coming sem,btohqsg
good at heart is more impt,btohqsg
Uk I love how ur just casually  throwing out the N words like how guys always fail nnn,btohqsg
tat's why i hate is mods,btohqsg
cuz engineering got a fk load of slackers in poly,btohqsg
accidentally sat down on a cucumber too hard,btohqsg
Every course got fking slackers one,btohqsg
the ratio is proportional to the cut off points of the course,btohqsg
Bro is getting into the nsfw territory,btohqsg
alot of the girls in my class always use pms to get out of pe,btohqsg
they have pms like every week bruh,btohqsg
It's not for pe tho LOL it's for ns one,btohqsg
im p sure bedok has pms everyday,btohqsg
"Yo my Cher be like "" a little bit of light exercise is good one""",btohqsg
u wan how many day mc,btohqsg
i used to use gout as a excuse,btohqsg
but fker give 1 day only,btohqsg
last time can say got runny nose cough 5 day mc straight,btohqsg
its a T05 thing i guess,btohqsg
engineering is rly easy to get in,btohqsg
because there is this program in np called CEP,btohqsg
back in 2021 i think cut off was almost 20,btohqsg
fr. i wanna be rich and preach about the environment and drive around in a ferrari,btohqsg
common eng and eng w biz is the two course v w high cut off point one,btohqsg
Unless you‚Äôre a rags to riches story,btohqsg
10 years down the road she will realise how dumb she was,btohqsg
wait so she got scammed abt 3.4something K ringgit,btohqsg
assuming it was before 3.5 hike,btohqsg
dude 16 yo is not young,btohqsg
if ur 16 and willing to spend 1k for a perm u need help,btohqsg
then again many 07s r spoilt niggas,btohqsg
i tot u siding her in the other chat,btohqsg
if not she wouldn't complain after,btohqsg
she just shouldn't have paid without finding out more,btohqsg
she more likely was humble bragging,btohqsg
dude she said the guy told her b4,btohqsg
her exact words she got scammed even tho the person said $100 at first so,btohqsg
call her stupid for still paying sure,btohqsg
but in this case idt she was bragging lol,btohqsg
NO WAY HER PARENTS ALLOWED A 1K PERM,btohqsg
she gonna be a dependent kid for life,btohqsg
anyway i no longer o lv alr,btohqsg
she dead ass say she wan marry rich hubby,btohqsg
no shit everyone does but u dont make it a priority,btohqsg
can find those old auntie at starbucks,btohqsg
u old nigga no way ur being fr,btohqsg
man idk how to respond to that,btohqsg
i'm just not a useless person that has to depend on someone else to support me,btohqsg
her perm money would've been nice for my loan,btohqsg
i tot she was someone's junior or smth,btohqsg
"""money is important"" proceeds to buy 35 dollar waffle and 1k dollar perm",btohqsg
eh but how waffle cost 35 dollars,btohqsg
the max i tot would be like 10+,btohqsg
35 dollar more than 1 week of my allowance,btohqsg
and they give fking ice cream on top of it,btohqsg
if increase price by 20 cents i will ask the auntie,btohqsg
if mbs that kind then understandable,btohqsg
the broking straw is when she comment how period is worst than ns,btohqsg
how much does sec sch food cost nowadays,btohqsg
low ends are 2.8 to 3.5,btohqsg
in my definition anything abv 4 quite ex,btohqsg
i think poly n uni roughly same ?,btohqsg
expensive is anything above 6 in hawker,btohqsg
zl is a stereotypical textbook liberal,btohqsg
coz my campus in poly so no diff for me,btohqsg
gonna miss my $3 lunches in sec sch canteen,btohqsg
have to up a bit cuz wingstop uk,btohqsg
those are live savers for my wallet,btohqsg

cheapest thing near me is about 3.50,btohqsg
fk that shit  make ur rest worth,btohqsg
when u groom your child in the greenhouse,btohqsg

U have not interacted with enough 07 kids I assume,btohqsg
"The 07s I interact with come from a specific ""elite"" sch in sg",btohqsg
the only 07's i interact are the sane ones,btohqsg
"imo they're pretty goofy ahh and like using alot of slangs like "" slay bitch"" "" slay""",btohqsg
I keep using text speak irl,btohqsg
Then some of my friends alw,btohqsg
I'm not used to how U speak when I first meet uüò≠,btohqsg
ngl I did get a bit of culture shock at start of the year  considering the fact I barely interacted with ppl ard my age for the past 2 years I retake Os ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
That's basically the best word to describe my cohort,btohqsg
They make it seem like it's a cool thing,btohqsg
But eh wth anw my class is weird to begin with,btohqsg
Every one has their own charisma ü§©,btohqsg
Like after u interact with them/us for awhile  you'll find out there's a  loose screw in each and every one of us,btohqsg
that's the best summary I can give,btohqsg
You mix weird and unhinged tgth  you get authenticity,btohqsg
""" nice hairstyle/compliment/wtv shit"" "" slayyy/uk what they always say  another day another slay """,btohqsg
wow  I'm just wowing at how uncommon it act is LOL,btohqsg
It'll automatically unscrew by itself by an unknown force and become even looser,btohqsg
Literally every sentence prolly got some singlish come out,btohqsg
can I ask if ppl still say lmao irl,btohqsg
right cause my overseas Fri hear me say that and he's like Ew it's so cringe hearing u say lmao irl,btohqsg
If it's cringe it's cringe lor,btohqsg
yea my pt   I wasn't gonna hold back anw,btohqsg
i have a friend that talks like he's in a twitch chat irl,btohqsg
I mean sometimes is got la,btohqsg
Lucky my relatives haven't ask me what I mean when I say some word,btohqsg
I'm so used to it alrd,btohqsg
Cuz my friends all keep using,btohqsg
Then I kinda adapted it too,btohqsg
I sometimes literally speak in emoji,btohqsg
Ah must be hard to catch up HAHA,btohqsg
That 1 rly made my friend go,btohqsg
Cuz my friend keep using it also,btohqsg
The way I speak and all,btohqsg
Legit high-key is a rojak of all the,btohqsg
it's the name of a car brand,btohqsg
Not if they dk what it means,btohqsg
"Random qn  Does anyone rmb pri sch english "" synthesis and transformation "" ?",btohqsg
Those english assessment books gave me nightmares,btohqsg
I think now they don't call it that anymore,btohqsg
i saw it in my sisters ws b4,btohqsg
I mean close passage and vocab ig it's ok but synthesis and transformation is just üíÄ,btohqsg
u don't even use it after p6,btohqsg
If ppl don't dump it b4 they reach upper sec   idek where else those vocab word bank go,btohqsg
i rmb penmenship was the worst one leh,btohqsg
pri sch eng was so bad,btohqsg
Tbh i feel pri sch subj dont study also can,btohqsg
i never study for pri sch got 247 t score,btohqsg
i study so hard only 190‚Ä¶,btohqsg
just pay attn in class and do hw,btohqsg
ew this was so bad omg,btohqsg
my handwriting is still shit asf,btohqsg
my handwriting only improved at like sec 1,btohqsg
mine went frm illegible big ass handwriting to small ass till u need a magnifying glass handwriting,btohqsg
i love how my p4 math cher traumatised me,btohqsg
Better find cure for cancer after u grad,btohqsg
The worst teacher is those old school ones,btohqsg
HAHA lol same I got 186,btohqsg
Was thr like syllabus change or smth during Ur time for psle,btohqsg
I loved that shit lol it was repetitive but fun trying to perfect it,btohqsg
I keep getting 4/5 tho for a penman writing rest,btohqsg
nigg i ain't even that much older than u,btohqsg
but 07 is the first batch to have the 70rp for a levels,btohqsg
what the fuck is gg on with them,btohqsg
then u study the h1 for??,btohqsg
we suffered through all that and now theyre reducing the stakes,btohqsg
ngl the new system encourages ppl to take 4h2s,btohqsg
cause if you screw 1 h2 you still have another as a backup (only 3h2s used in rp calc so 4h2 allows you to kinda screw one),btohqsg
Yo im not the one with an untouched chem tys !!,btohqsg
I thought now is normally 3h2 1h1,btohqsg
Half of my cohort cmi this year,btohqsg
Apparently compared to last year  there's gonna more retainees,btohqsg
my sch also encourage ppl to take 3h2 1h1,btohqsg
they keep saying dont need to take 4h2s,btohqsg
The fact that it's normal is idk unsurprising? Cause ppl who come mi usually retake Os/indecisive/wan try As route/just go with flow,btohqsg
Still have to take h1 right?,btohqsg
Do uk if there's some ppl in those jcs  that take 4 h2s?,btohqsg
But that extra H2 is self study,btohqsg
they indirectly encourage taking 3h2 1h1 la,btohqsg
but then i want 4h2 for my own reasons and i hit reqs ady so they oso cannot stop me,btohqsg
Some uk unis prefer 4h2s i heard,btohqsg
ngl they keep saying dont need 4h2 also wont die one,btohqsg
my senpais mostly 3h2 1h1 though,btohqsg
but most ppl are still gonna take PCMe anyways so,btohqsg
Alot of ppl ik do that lol,btohqsg
Im not the one asking for help everyday in the discord before a levels,btohqsg
Ya if i cannot then i drop lor,btohqsg
But at first when they took H2 econs  is it to build strong foundation or smth,btohqsg
If not  it felt like they wasted a year,btohqsg
Heard some funny stuff about my sch econs dept,btohqsg
also im not interested in the content at all,btohqsg
econs is a horrible subject lmao,btohqsg
Honestly the whole contrasting subject idea,btohqsg
not even kidding I hated chem but I think contrasting subject was a different level of hate,btohqsg
I at least bothered to study chem but didn't bother w my contrasting subject,btohqsg
Ah when u put it that way   it makes much more sense lol,btohqsg
I see my friend's H2 econs notes and the  moment I saw the line curving I knew it was over,btohqsg
Why look like a fking incomplete cubic curve,btohqsg
H2 bio H2 geog H2 chem h1 math,btohqsg
I've heard many bio students dropping h2 math to h1 oddly,btohqsg
What abt instead of H2 chem it's H2 lit,btohqsg
LOL THATS A BIG TWIST OF FATE,btohqsg
I can't imagine doing the case studies,btohqsg
send me. my mentee maybe can use lol,btohqsg
I love econs for now but,btohqsg
I feel like I won't say the same next yr LUL,btohqsg
Ohya I know got a class,btohqsg
For some reason ik 3 students who take BCMG  all 3 got A for B and G,btohqsg
Geog as a subject is q repetitive,btohqsg
I see two heavy content subject tgth,btohqsg
the lecture book is gonna be thicc asf,btohqsg
U can fragment the subject into simpler pieces,btohqsg
Like if u were to have bio and geog lessons on the same day,btohqsg
That's also cuz all schs for geog teach irrelevant stuff that u can remove,btohqsg
Issue with geog is that the syllabus is so vague,btohqsg
Teachers also dont know what is in syllabus and what is not in syllabus,btohqsg
For me I just abandoned two subjects (H2 Chem and H2 Physics),btohqsg
Isn't it choatic when they teach,btohqsg
The only thing camvridge has ever said abt the syllabus is thatThe content from the papers would use the phrasing of the syllabus doc,btohqsg
But literally u can go so deep into any of the chapters that not many schs know whe to stop,btohqsg
That's why different schs learn completely different things as well,btohqsg
EtcMI Deforestation teaches weird ass shitEvery other sch teaches the same thing,btohqsg
Maladaptive Behavior: No point studying because not enough deforestationCognitive Restructuring: Cut down more trees to rejustify teaching about deforestatiob,btohqsg
yo I thought it's a meme,btohqsg
I didn't know it was a thing LOL,btohqsg
Cuz JC u can smoke more,btohqsg
New sylla more human geog heavy rite,btohqsg
dawg i got a 100% a1 streak for history,btohqsg
