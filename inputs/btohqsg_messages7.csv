I think this one maybe later in the month - saw that Nov SBF was announced on 28 Dec (if i'm not wrong),btohqsg
And since 21 May is BTO only  seems likely it'll be later!,btohqsg
Sbf is 6 wks.not being rude All info are stated at hdb website.,btohqsg
I do not see the date of sbf result in hdb website,btohqsg
it's ok  so the results for BTO takes 4 and SBF takes 6 weeks respectively,btohqsg
ok my mum received her SBF result on 29th Dec,btohqsg
second timers have chance to get single digit too while first timers have chance to get balloted beyond supplies,btohqsg
so all in all it's all about luck unless you're riding on MGPS and GRO schemes which may have undesired situations,btohqsg
Almost 25% of those in 45 age range have 500k or more in CPF,btohqsg
means haven't deducted for housing yet,btohqsg
don't use your DBS POSB card for now,btohqsg
Anyone applied for BTO using the priority schemes   such as parenthood priority scheme and married child priority scheme?,btohqsg
Is it the same as first timer 2 chances of ballot?,btohqsg
As your balloted queue position has far exceeded the flat supply  we regret to inform you that your application is not successful.GG,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt even get a half f number,btohqsg
it's ok go for kovan or Queenstown next!,btohqsg
Ya going to try Kovan next. If don‚Äôt get  Nov got Hougang,btohqsg
Can i ask sth  so if i get queue number this time means im invited to book a flat ady? So means if i reject now will be counted as i forfeit once?,btohqsg
Is your number within the number of units available?,btohqsg
your ballot number divided by 0.8 that's the highest ballot number to have chance for 20% as that's an average dropout rate,btohqsg
Your application has been balloted with a queue position of 279 out of 265  if dont wan will go down will get affect my chance on next balloting?,btohqsg
wont affect my next ballot chance right?,btohqsg
I got 500plus but available unit is 411,btohqsg
So was just wondering if i mamaged to ballot until amd i reject will it affect my chances,btohqsg
sorry but can you rephrase your question,btohqsg
You mean you plan to give up?,btohqsg
i mean if they call me up and left with 2nd floor  i can dont want right? will affect my next ballot chance?,btohqsg
based on your number I highly doubt that you'd only have choices for 2nd level,btohqsg
Agree! Stands a very good chance to select,btohqsg
suay suay left 2nd floor  can reject? will affect my chance next round?,btohqsg
That one you have to appeal I think,btohqsg
Even if want reject and will affect chances also bo bian ady since selected,btohqsg
0.5% dropout rate to squeeze into the selection for 279 out of 265,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why half f number sucks,btohqsg
Hi  anybody knows if let say the queue it‚Äôs 9xx out of 1010 for 4 room  u think will get good flat ?,btohqsg
at least you're in queue for selection lol,btohqsg
sorry  i lost it at your display picture...,btohqsg
take it that the average d/o rate of BTO launches is 20%,btohqsg
Im also worried about this ! Mine is 800plus leh üò≥,btohqsg
Hopefully will be not too low lv,btohqsg
I scared get lower floors sia üòÜ,btohqsg
Anybody know if got telegram group for MacPherson waves?,btohqsg
I also scared but yours shld be wont la,btohqsg
Yours within the no  still got 200 units to spare,btohqsg
Congratulations to everyone who has gotten a ballot number!!!For those who missed  it's OK! Because there is another round soon! Better luck in the next one.,btohqsg
Same here hahahah ! Going for Queenstown or else ec,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know donated how many $10 already,btohqsg
Thank u man for the assurance üôè,btohqsg
Actually hor  it's not really about the 10bucks  but rather time. Let's say on average one year got 3 bto exercises. 30$ means one year gone. If u donated 100bucks  means you have been trying for a home for 3 years plus le.,btohqsg
I donated since applying for singles 2 room until now with bf applying as a couple.. still don‚Äôt give me a number haha,btohqsg
If apply for Queenstown will the Chance be higher tho? Or same,btohqsg
should be the same cos its mature estate,btohqsg
increased chances only apply for non-mature if im not wrong,btohqsg
I‚Äôm considering Ec or Queenstown . But like if the chance is the same Ec better right ? Pick the unit u like .,btohqsg
Yes  only non mature if i rmb,btohqsg
Are u talking about SBF or BTO?,btohqsg
If SBF the ballot goes by estate,btohqsg
dont know about any EC projects upcoming,btohqsg
If u can handle the finances to afford an EC  always go for an EC.,btohqsg
If y‚Äôall actually dint mind paying for Telok Blangah and u dint get   pay abit more for Ec,btohqsg
I rather bto and town side then Ec but not town side,btohqsg
Its OK one. At least is RCR,btohqsg
but also this kind of artist impression... take it with a pinch of salt LOL,btohqsg
"there is no EC BTO. its just selling condos at ""affordable pricing"" compared to private condos",btohqsg
All new BTO bidders if you have a bid and number  please quickly choose your unit. If not  by the time you drag  you might get your flat when you are old only,btohqsg
now minimum wait is 7 to 8 years. There is always ripples and aftermath effect and the flat sure delay  could be possibly up to 10 years,btohqsg
unless you are getting married at 18  prospectively  you can get your house at 28 years old,btohqsg
My agent told me . If u keen I can pass u his number,btohqsg
if you all want to choose good location  and plan these and that  the timeline may not work in your favor. then when you are old  then u settle for more expensive units such as resale or any lousy unit come by u also sup,btohqsg
Well said. This is good advice.A bird in hand is better than 2 in the bush.If u have a chance to pick a unit now  before u forgo it  u must consider the current situation. Will you get this chance again? Even if so  how long more? Can you afford the wait?,btohqsg
I think I‚Äôll try Queenstown then if that one still cannot try Ec . Queenstown good location,btohqsg
Ya. Not bad. Near Queensway shopping centre and anchor point,btohqsg
Anybody can send the telegram chat for macpherson's weaves? Thanksb,btohqsg
doesnt means that SBF is faster. We have SBF-balloters ballot for WWSR2  end up  the main con bankrupt  then delay already  then covid  then now lack of workers,btohqsg
if the person infront of you buy a meepok at $3.50. and for the same amount  u pay $4.50  would you want?,btohqsg
this is the same concept for SBF. your neighbour pay $280k  for the same unit  u pay $320k,btohqsg
If other stalls long queue then too bad üòÇ,btohqsg
not including the accrued interest YET,btohqsg
I mean they bought way earlier than you,btohqsg
Last time hdb only 100k plus,btohqsg
moral of the story  if u get a chance in this day and age  just go for selection  cant choose anymore,btohqsg
"i see many ""young"" people or ""first timers"" here wanna pick their best unit. Wait till they choose their unit and the communication between themselves and HDB  they will vomit blood",btohqsg
"then u will feel that this ""dream unit"" isnt a dream unit after all",btohqsg
"the journey isnt that rosy for ""public housing""",btohqsg
"if any ""young"" people or ""first timers"" can afford condo  ur journey might not be that bad.",btohqsg
"but then every month got to pay senseless ""town council"" fees",btohqsg
"these ""young people"" / ""first-timers"" have yet to encounter the ""templated response"" from HDB that pisses them off haha",btohqsg
they will sound so sweet to humour you  but then u realised is just template marcom,btohqsg
if your luck good  just go for the estate u want. if cant get  move on to the next one,btohqsg
for those lucky to be staying with parents  good for them. for those renting  and when HDB changes the DPD dates time after time  which just take them 2 mins to send an email to the webmaster  while those paying rent burn in their rent  paying month to month  when they can be used for renovations,btohqsg
unless u are 18 years old AND married  and secured a BTO unit  if not  u do not have much choices,btohqsg
But then again  everyone picks their own path and makes their own choice.Just have to bear in mind the consequences.,btohqsg
He's brought up very valid points. So those with ballot numbers and a chance to pick  please consider carefully before forgoing.,btohqsg
"when you folks get your ""estate telegram groupchat"" u see that some people will say ""my current 3-room flats  got my parents in law  my brother in law  me and my husband and i am pregnant"" hear liao also wanna cry",btohqsg
Dear Sir/Madam Update on Progress of PUNGGOL EASTWe wish to give you an update on the construction progress of your BTO flat at Waterway Sunrise  arising from the impact of COVID-19.2     Earlier in Aug 2020  we had informed you that the flat you had booked was estimated to be completed in 4Q 2021  a delay of about 9 months from the original completion date. This was due to the disruption in construction activities caused by the Circuit Breaker in 2020 and other restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic  which has affected both the private and public sectors. Since then  we have been closely monitoring the progress of Waterway Sunrise I and working with the contractor to expedite the construction works as much as possible.3     However  with the tightening of border controls for workers from South Asia since end-April 2021  further delays are expected for many private and public sector projects  including the completion of some BTO projects. Depending on how prolonged the manpower shortage is  HDB expects the completion of some BTO projects to be delayed by a further 3 months or more. This means a total delay of up to a year  or possibly more  for some BTO projects.4     Arising from this new development  we regret to inform you that based on our latest estimate  your flat is now expected to be completed in 1Q 2022. HDB is working closely with the project contractor and consultants to ensure that construction works keep to the revised timelines as much as possible  without compromising on the quality of the project  as well as the safety and well-being of our workers. These efforts include various support measures such as cost sharing of non-manpower related cost increases to help contractors through this difficult period  and getting exemptions to allow less noisy construction activities to be carried out on Sundays and Public Holidays where possible.5     We are sorry for the inconvenience and difficulties that this delay may cause you. While we are trying our best to complete your flat as soon as we can  we seek your understanding that the overall COVID-19 situation remains uncertain  and quite a number of factors like the continued supply of construction workers largely outside our control. We will continue to keep you updated on the completion date of your new flat through email and via your My HDBPage account  as construction progresses.6     Meanwhile  should you have any queries or require any assistance  please let us know via this e-feedback form  and we will do our best to assist you. We will arrange for you to collect the keys to your new flat as soon as it is ready.7     We thank you for your continued patience.Yours sincerely SALES OPERATIONS SECTIONESTATE ADMIN & PROPERTY GROUPHOUSING & DEVELOPMENT BOAR,btohqsg

Dear Sir/Madam Update on Progress of PUNGGOL EAST We wish to give you an update on the construction progress of your BTO flat at Waterway Sunrise  arising from the impact of COVID-19 (WE  HDB  ARE PROTECTED BY COVID-19  SO SUCK IT).2     Earlier in Aug 2020  we had informed you that the flat you had booked was estimated to be completed in 4Q 2021  a delay of about 9 months from the original completion date  (WE JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU HAPPY).This was due to the disruption in construction activities caused by the Circuit Breaker in 2020 and other restrictions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic  which has affected both the private and public sectors (IF I  HDB CAN LUMP EVERYTHING  OF COURSE LUMP EVERYTHING TOGETHER LAH).Since then  we have been closely monitoring (CAN YOU SHOW PROOF THAT YOU ARE MONITORING CLOSELY?

Hello  Does the q no. We received now is consider as the 2 chance ballot ?,btohqsg

non mature1st time - 1 chance2nd time - 2 chances3rd time - 3 chances4th time - 4 chances5th time - 5 chancesmust be all non-mature estate,btohqsg
mature estate1st time - 1 chance2nd time - 1 chance3rd time - 1 chance4th time - 1 chance5th time - 1 chance,btohqsg
if you are 24 years old  dating and planning to get married  do note that you could potentialy receive ur flat approximately at 34 years old,btohqsg
What do you mean by that? Sorry trying to understand. Cause I received 495 out of the 411 unit available.,btohqsg
There will only be 1 queue number given,btohqsg
So yes that's your queue number,btohqsg
based on 30% drop out rate  u could have the last 123.3 units of choices,btohqsg
u will still be in the race to choose lower to ground floor (if everyone chose their unit) could be possibly some high units give up too,btohqsg
yes its heng sway  some times when u are even within the 30 percentile  they will tell u all the units have been chosen,btohqsg
thats why i feel alot of  young people or first timer here  buy a toto ticket and post on fb instagram like they won the top prize,btohqsg
i ballot 5 times to get my number in 2017,btohqsg
"Hellos. So I was helping my aunt apply for 2rm flexi and got the email saying she might still have a chance if people in front of her forgo. Is that a template reply? Or it applies only to people with queue number within a certain range?For example  if only got 200 units  will a person with q number 700 still get this kind of ""dont give up! You might still have a chance!"" text? Or only people within  say the next 150 i.e. q number 201 to 350 will get this?",btohqsg
i got to wait till 2022 to get my unit,btohqsg
I also got my number in 2017.Just collected keys recently. Hand in their  bro. Soon.,btohqsg
200 units with number 700  bro  can move on to next ballot liao,btohqsg
I think all with queue number outside of supply range will get this message,btohqsg
thanks bro  its not even 50% built,btohqsg
They give number up to 300% of units available only.,btohqsg
279 to 216  maybe got chance  but dam slim  all the unwanted units,btohqsg
like those above coffeeshop or beside rubbish bin ones,btohqsg
after u get dissapointed for 5 times  u will learn that this is luck,btohqsg
Bobian. I know your frustration  now only can wait. At least you have a unit that is coming  as opposed to other people who have failed round after round after round.End goal is always to have a roof over our heads.,btohqsg
yes  and sometimes there are other underlying stuff like grandparents passing bad habits to kids  and when u teach ur kids  ur parents intervene,btohqsg
got good got bad  they can help to take care of kids  but it comes as a package  good and bad together,btohqsg
I feel u man  but u Only can pray and wait...,btohqsg
and for all the parents to be... when u plan that next year u will move  and lawrence wong comes to u with a screw driver to stick it up ur ass....,btohqsg
ur registration for kindgerten and primary school  all messed up,btohqsg
or u stay from a very far location  u got to wake up earlier to prepare the kids and send them to school  lesser sleep,btohqsg
lets talk money. CPF  there is a capped on contribution  20% and 17% on max pay at $6k. assuming u take the highest cap  u work  how many years then u times 2 by your spouse  barely can even own a condo,btohqsg
unless u willing to live like a nomad. first 5 years  buy coffeeshop chair and table and sleep on straw mat in ur flat. then once sell after MOP then buy condo  maybe got abit more,btohqsg
but then got to payback 5 years of accrued interest  left not much behind  still got to take 2nd loan,btohqsg
unless u got parents to back u up or u are some equity trader whom made it big at the stock market. if not  life is not instagramable. haha,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I successfully received a ballot # for Telok Blangah 4rm; anyone know where I can get the floor plan ?,btohqsg
log into your hdb portal and click on ur registration number,btohqsg
i clicked registration no but no direction to floorplan?,btohqsg
I think he referring to brochure,btohqsg
honestly  all these market forces are based on false perception. for those who die die want to stay in prime areas or near MRT.Covid has made the REITS in the CBD areas worthless  everyone is working from home. Stall owners in Lau Pa Sat is burning in rent  wherewas there are still operations in a coffeeshop.its all about planning. Yes it is understandable that people want to stay near MRT because they can save time to travel. but the amount you paid with accrued interest  if you stayed somewhere further  you can own a car. but did anyone dictate that you have to buy a car now? take public transport for now  and when older  or when retire  you would have saved enough to pay off the car in cash in fulli noticed that people who stayed near MRT  their neighbours are usually rented out units. these neighbours usually would not care about cleaniness or could attract undesirable patrons. And the blocks around MRT are melting pots for anyone to hang out there.,btohqsg
Hi anyone knows if there is woodgrove ascent groupchat?,btohqsg
Queenstown bro. Last time told u le.,btohqsg
Yea. Supposed to get last year  but our dear friend covid did what it does best....,btohqsg
i still got to wait until april next year,btohqsg
Abit more nia bro  hang in there.,btohqsg
bro  nov 2016 ballot  until 2022 then get,btohqsg
Oh mine was sbf 2017  could be the reason why it's quicker.,btohqsg
Sale of Flats in May 2017 Sale of Balance Flats ExerciseThank you for your application to buy a¬†4-room flat¬†at¬†Queenstown.Your application has been balloted with a queue position of¬†159. Although your queue position is beyond the¬†131¬†unit(s) of flats on offer  you may still have a chance to book a flat on your selection appointment. This is because some of the applicants queued ahead of you may not book a flat.,btohqsg
mine was BTO. i am quite anal about paying more than my neighbour for the same unit. so i didnt take SBF,btohqsg
Anyways. Ya my number was outside  but still managed to get to select. I didn't forgo,btohqsg
Haha for me  roof over head man,btohqsg
U know la. It's in front of me le  take only.,btohqsg
yes bro - take only also for me,btohqsg
Anyways  those who have numbers  can start to research on the project. Facing  west sun  which stick which unit.Do these earlier and list out preferred units. Makes your selection a lot easier. Those with shit numbers like me  don't waste time on research... Go there see what leftover and take the best of the rest.,btohqsg
yes thats right bro. its literally based on luck. if an applicant is asked to go to select a unit  and they didnt like the unit  they are deemed as rejecting this chance . then got to wait for 1 year bar,btohqsg
unless HDB tell u that the flats are all selected  if not  just take only,btohqsg
HDB has made the entire system based on luck  no strategy nor ways can get the unit you want,btohqsg
cant game the system. it has been created to prevent 1st timers to pick and choose the units they want unless luck is on their side. and for 2nd timer  it is designed to discourage them for bidding the BTO flats for the 2nd time,btohqsg
even houses  the lower units have balcony but not taller units. HDB have designed all flats not to have all the good attributes,btohqsg
the checklist of wants will never be all ticked. unless u buy private property,btohqsg
Just search woodlands may bto 2021 that one is active,btohqsg
Queenstown  some of the Dawson's projects are smaller in size,btohqsg
Yeap. Very true. Estates in the center regions mostly have this trait,btohqsg
Not really suitable for bigger families.,btohqsg
but how far is the walk to mrt,btohqsg
under the sun is no joke,btohqsg
plus if you're carrying bags of stuffs,btohqsg
which project is the nearest to MRT ah,btohqsg
Ok la. I find 8mins acceptable. Currently my parents place is close to 15,btohqsg
Soon the closest will be SkyResidences,btohqsg
But I recall seeing available units in the SBF exercise,btohqsg
Meaning it is possible to get those  albeit at a much higher price now with the current market conditions.,btohqsg
Cannot rmb. And I don't think the data is available now  since the exercise is over.,btohqsg
yes by luck  ST can get a very low number while FT can get number beyond supplies,btohqsg
Those houses are a thing tho,btohqsg
For selection unit appt   we need to print the cpf statements just in case or dont need ?,btohqsg
U can la. But I rmb for mine  it wasn't used. They basically logged in for me on their computers and printed whatever they needed.Doesn't hurt to be extra prepared.Congratulations btw.,btohqsg
U printed your transaction + contribution history or just one of it ?Thank you !! üòÖüòä,btohqsg
Forgot liao hahaBut I was prepared la  whatever they asked üòâ,btohqsg
Anything else for me to print except the ones stated on the appt letter ? üòÖ,btohqsg
it's ok if you never brought your statements along because they will ask you to produce it with the URL given to you  saves on carbon footprint,btohqsg
and payment must be by NETS,btohqsg
my mum went to select her's only brought an IC along was told to provide CPF statements and payslips within 2 weeks with a given URL,btohqsg
Ohh i see ! Ok good hahahah thank u!!,btohqsg
It's good to bring. But they will login your singpass app to link their computer as well,btohqsg
I bring all the relevant documents they asked.  But they din see it. Cos they log in my singpass to link whatever data they need for the booking.  Then they will deduct 10 or 15% of payment from your cpf and will rebate you back thr $500 deposit.,btohqsg
This I when after you booked your unit. Should be the 3rd appointment,btohqsg
$500 is for those who chosen 3r,btohqsg
Hello! Just asking if the package they will send to us will include the price for the unit?,btohqsg
it will all be inside your HDB portal under your registration number,btohqsg
speaking of which my reg no is non double digit,btohqsg
1st appt - selection exercise  2nd appt - signing of AFL  3rd appt - getting keys,btohqsg
if any of you or your SO is below 30 (from the date of application)  just need 5% payment,btohqsg
eh can I check for hitting basic retirement sum  is it just SA or OA+SA?,btohqsg
SA but I think pass 55/65 OA and SA gets combined,btohqsg
Alright noted . I printed whatever was asked on the appt letter. The rest of it if they need then i'll just email or use the url asxwmentioned üòÖ thank u!,btohqsg
I still lesser thanhalf pill of water,btohqsg
noooooooooooo all of us are learning,btohqsg
Woodgrove ascent.. which BLK is bto 2 room? 3 rooms..n 4 rooms types?,btohqsg
May I ask for selection of unit do I need to get my HLE ready? And I just change a new job this payslip I only have the last month will it affect?,btohqsg
But there is no gap between the previous job and this job thus cpf contribution is constant,btohqsg
how come your app is showing the updated map?,btohqsg
yes need to do HLE which has a validity of 6 months   can apply for grant as long as you have worked continuously for 12 months prior¬†to the flat application,btohqsg
list down your criteria for a flat  top choice is normally to avoid the sun facing units,btohqsg
but usually it is the last of the list,btohqsg
oooo whatever is left as long not next to the chute,btohqsg
same situation as me. they will take your average for the past three months. but they will email/call you to provide more information (e.g. payslip from jan to mar) but it‚Äôs on a case by case,btohqsg
if you have worked consecutively for a year then no issue for getting HLE as it requires you to work consecutively for 3 months,btohqsg
However when I apply for HLE they need 3 months payslip. I just provide the one month that I have and my cpf contribution can since there is no gap?,btohqsg
how can there be no gap when you only have one month payslip,btohqsg
U just provide what U have.  Anything missing can always upload again in myhdbpage at a later part. Just remember to submit before the deadline given,btohqsg
The previous company I didn't download the soft copy payslip before I left. So I don't have the previous company payslip,btohqsg
It's from the internal HR portal that we have ü•∫,btohqsg
still she has to approach the previous coy for the missingpayslip,btohqsg
ask the HDB can they just refer to your CPF statements,btohqsg
I was thinking. I'll call on Monday to check,btohqsg
Ya I think this one should be possible.  Maybe ask HDB to confirm will be better.,btohqsg
Okay thanks thanks! I will call them on Monday ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
can approach your nearest HDB branch to ask  but they also need you to book an appointment see whether can just ask them one question without checking in,btohqsg
I'm going back to school every 3 months,btohqsg
i didn‚Äôt have for mine too! you can write in and they will email you an income undertaking form to be uploaded,btohqsg
they will just need your CPF statement because from there they can roughly gauge how much you earn and then your declaration on the form,btohqsg
about 65x of your combined pay equals to your loan amount,btohqsg
Usually how long will u guys/ people wait after the flat is just completed and renovated to move in ?,btohqsg
Im considering about the renovation works from neighbours . Will it be too early if i just move in after mine is renovated ?,btohqsg
why the wait before settle in?,btohqsg
my mum's current house  we shifted in even before the reno was completed due to the auspicious date and tight timeline of 6 weeks between key collection to shifting home,btohqsg
Because my friend told me they moved in right after their reno is completed because their neighbour's renos are still ongoing   its unlimited amounts of noises during the day time and cleaning of their own house,btohqsg
we were lucky because our neighbour left their house vacant before they rented out their flat after 6 years,btohqsg
haha thinking to ask my new neighbours when are they going to reno their house should I meet them after key collections,btohqsg
Your bto don't have a group chat?,btohqsg
know also no use since most of the new home owners are probably renovating their house at the similar timeline,btohqsg
I think there's no perfect answer la. It's more of which one more urgent. I know of some who are renting while waiting for their bto to be completed. I'm sure these folks will move once their reno are done.,btohqsg
Im also planning to move in once my reno is done . Just that idk whether will that be a good idea . I dont like to wait either ü§£,btohqsg
maybe you can wait for your neighour beside you  opposite you  on top of you and bottom of you to finish reno before you commence your reno,btohqsg
Depends on the needs of yourself and your family unit.If u have to move  u have to move. If you wanna avoid the Reno works of your neighbours and have the available living space else where to do so  u can opt to do that. It's really up to the persons wants and requirements  there isnt a most ideal move in timing or period.,btohqsg
Hi  can I ask is there a possibility for HDB to assess the combined income before 12 months of employment? My understanding is they count at the point of application. But we only a few days to reach 12 months of employment. Anyone has similar case to share? ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
means you haven't applied for HLE yet?,btohqsg
I think u can appeal to them to consider,btohqsg
I m assuming this is for the EHG?,btohqsg
Bcos they sent me thiss so im assuming few weeks will not be ‚Äútoo big a deviation for them to consider a waiver‚Äù,btohqsg
usually first HLE they just wanna know your situation like what u are doing,btohqsg
the serious HLE is when u collect keys  because thats where the loan kicks in,btohqsg
if u are just paying downpayment  they need HLE to see if u can afford the 10%,btohqsg
Not yet  have not booked the flat.,btohqsg
Did you email HDB or how you appeal to them? I wish to ask hdb for wavier too,btohqsg
I went thru nyhdbpage and use the myrequest portal,btohqsg
Ok! I did the same thing too. Hope Hdb Will review my case! üëçüèª,btohqsg
Questions.  Q1.  Will renew of HLE takes long time?.  Q2. In the normal situation   from receiving letter to keys collection is how many weeks. ?  Sorry  maybe is a repeated Questions.,btohqsg
1. within a week 2. can be as fast as a week,btohqsg
best is to give some buffer for the HLE,btohqsg
2 weeks apply for it before your appointment,btohqsg
May i check during the building of a BTO  does the internal works such as electrical wiring or toilets goes concurrently with the external?,btohqsg
haha this one really have to check with people from construction industry,btohqsg
Ohh wondering for the case of my own bto,btohqsg
So wanted to see if anyone in this group knows,btohqsg
No sure how updated was this article.HERE'S A BREAKDOWN OF THE USUAL¬†BUILDING PROCESS FOR A HDB BTO PROJECTTotal Construction ProcessEstimated time taken to complete:¬†976 days1st¬†stage: Substructure StageThis stage is where they create the foundation or sub-structure of your flat. This refers to piling  earthworks  construction of sewers and others.How long it takes:¬†297 days.2nd¬†stage: Structural StageThis stage is when the building works commence. All structural works are done in this phase including building of every floor.How long it takes:¬†688 days.3rd¬†stage: Architectural StageThis is when the empty structure turns into a proper HDB flat occurs. Each unit is fitted with sanitary wares and fittings  waterproofing done  wall and floor finishes added  doors and windows fitted in too. Painting of the blocks will also commence here.How long it takes:¬†494 days.Construction of external features¬†such as signages  landscaping works  rain gardens  decks and drop-off porches are completed at the same times as the fittings of each block.How long it takes:¬†280 days.Inspection StageSeveral inspections have to be done before the keys are ready to be dolled out by HDB.How long it takes:¬†150 days.,btohqsg
That‚Äôs very helpful! Thank you so much!,btohqsg
Hi  may I know with regards to the queue number  is it out of the the available flat number of your selected flats type  e.g 4-room flat?Or the entire project e.g 2000 inclusive of 2/3/4/5 rooms flat?,btohqsg
Out of your selected flat types only,btohqsg
Any idea at which point we need apply for housing grants?,btohqsg
eh so now the new interface on HDB site can't see which are the unbooked units?,btohqsg
huh how to pick like that,btohqsg
it's like back to the old days,btohqsg
still can see those unbooked units?,btohqsg
hello  for the legal fees and stamp duty for BTO when do we pay it?,btohqsg
When you sign the agreement for lease. You pay these alongside your down-payment.,btohqsg
for BTO and SBF aka 2nd appointment  for downpayment  it's 3rd for SBF,btohqsg
Can but maybe for May not up yet,btohqsg
Open booking won‚Äôt affect our May BTO q no. Right,btohqsg
Hi there‚Ä¶ any group for Kallang breeze?,btohqsg
Hello  anyone balloted for MGPS before? How are the pre selected units like?,btohqsg
What project is this? How come there are floors which are higher than the others but in the same block?,btohqsg
The recent woodlands project. Woodgrove. The solo tall HDB is Telok Blangah,btohqsg
Thank u so much for this! Much needed .,btohqsg
Hi  anyone know when the SBF will release again eh?,btohqsg
This gives you an idea on how the PPVC HDB units are being built. Enjoy! üòä,btohqsg
Hi  any tele link for the Woodlands Ascent BTO?,btohqsg
pay $1mil for Duxton or Pinnacle or those town areas one ..still can understand.pay $1mil for boon keng... cannot comprehend.$800k for punggol? even worse,btohqsg
that's why BTO demand so high  resale market is too expensive now. Woodlands being one of the cheapest estates also close to 600k for 5rm  how to afford? what I see first thing in the morning...https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/49-year-old-hdb-terrace-house-in-whampoa-sold-for-record-1268-million,btohqsg
Actually... BTO prices also very high now. Like how profitable is Telok Blangah Beacon 4rm in the future? It's 710k now. Unless this 4R fetches 1M in the future after MOP  otherwise it will be damn lugi for more than ten years wait. (6years completion and 5 years to MOP).,btohqsg
These were only 800-900K when I was checking them out few years back .......,btohqsg
Can find original condition one for 650k even,btohqsg
But to stay 'landed' with towering HDB blocks right behind = no feel. No point.,btohqsg
Conservancy at $55/mth - that is a WOW,btohqsg
Imagine 2 fresh graduate  no savings no CPF  how to buy... that's why all fight for BTO now lorh  no matter who you are  the grants should cover the 5%  and give you another 5 years to earn the next 5%.,btohqsg
Erh.... but why would 2 fresh grad wanna buy BTO?,btohqsg
That's what most fresh grads do,btohqsg
Probably work on career first for at least 5 yrs?,btohqsg
Actually  alot of fresh grad couples buy bto,btohqsg
I see  sorry I boomer hahaha,btohqsg
No  most apply while they are in school to enjoy grants.,btohqsg
I did note there is new government policy for fresh grad to apply first,btohqsg
last time 25 year old all married have house have kids  now 25 year old no savings no job no house no kids üòÇ,btohqsg
Good also  to encourage couples to tie the knot early  have children early.,btohqsg
Considering the long waiting time as well...,btohqsg
My era average marriage age 30-32 for males wo,btohqsg
But the main problem now is the pricing... 700k for a bto.,btohqsg
But I guess that is water under the bridge... Since it's already oversubscribed and totally balloted out.,btohqsg
Non mature areas? Maybe start with 3rm first then slowly upgrade,btohqsg
My parents era did that....2r 3R 5r,btohqsg
That's because you're looking at the most expensive one. There are many other cheaper places available,btohqsg
The recent Woodlands one 400k for 5rm ok la,btohqsg
Median salary also rose over the decades,btohqsg
Nturally BTO pricing will rise in tandem.,btohqsg
years ago 5r at ulu yishun is $330k onwards,btohqsg
Drink less BBT can afford LOL,btohqsg
Now resale prices back to all time high. From 1999~2007 pretty stable pricing. 2014~2020 also quite stable. Now shoot up again.,btohqsg
Either way I'm glad I got my BTO after almost 10 tries üò≠  if not I need to continue headache about resale üòÖ,btohqsg
10 tries.. wah that's about 3 years,btohqsg
that's not the best plot of the area,btohqsg
best plot has been taken last year august,btohqsg
Resale 550k+ almost 600k.. I'd take 400k any day,btohqsg
But those who take bto now must be mentally prepared that their acquisition may yield very little profit to no profit.OK la. I mean HDB is meant to be a home  not a speculative investment vehicle .,btohqsg
Very little lor. And have to factor in more than ten years to realise that amount.,btohqsg
Hope u got a good location for your determination,btohqsg
Risk and reward wise  BTO now become purely own stay play. Can forget about for investment.... lots of forces trying to clamp its growth.,btohqsg
Socially and politically not gonna allow it to rise too much...,btohqsg
Yes  this time finally lucky  actually close to giving up alrdy  next 2 exercises this year don't have my preferred locations either.,btohqsg
(but then we keep seeing more and more >$1m resale HDB??) something not quite right,btohqsg
Yes  that's my point. Cos the other day my colleague got telok blangah beacon 4room. Being a close friend  I asked him to consider carefully.,btohqsg
Ya  part of it is the build up pressure and demand  leading to lottery effect mentality when get appointment to choose unit  then forget need to wait long long to move in,btohqsg
But T.Blangah Beacon is a very sought after one right? at least strike 4D,btohqsg
With resale value so high and bto building to be super slow  fresh grads usually apply bto asap so that by the time they get the keys they have enough savings and are also just nice in the age to start a family,btohqsg
Which is approx 28 yrs old,btohqsg
Thanks for the elaboration  I get it now,btohqsg
This pandemic really changed a lot of everything sigh,btohqsg
Anyways  bto is harder to get than winning toto or 4D now...,btohqsg
Almost every horizon is stretched out....,btohqsg
Yea  resale prices are driven up like crazy,btohqsg
Really up the demand for new homes as many are wfh and find that they need private space,btohqsg
Correct  the pain is biting most on a daily basis,btohqsg
The moment u see a punggol HDB sold at 900k.... Punggol. No offence la  but ya  punggol.,btohqsg
U know it when u see MSM featuring news of SINGLES who moved out for SPACE and 'growth',btohqsg
I stay there and... yeah  its defo not worth 900k,btohqsg
It has never happened b4 really.,btohqsg
I thought gov gonna have some sort of new rule to suppress the sales of HDB?,btohqsg
I top up 100k I can go skyterrace,btohqsg
I dunno why that guy go punggol,btohqsg
I also dont understand why people want to buy a 49 yo hdb for over 1 mil,btohqsg
Punggol is a well manicured (artificial IMO) estate,btohqsg
Might as well buy a car,btohqsg
The crowd can be maddening even during Phase 2 HA on weekends......,btohqsg
That price can get 99 yrs landed also in other location,btohqsg
Cannot get ur own parking lot in ur land as well,btohqsg
Need to park at public carpark...,btohqsg
Don't think it's worth the money. If I can summarise that location in 4 words.Out of the way,btohqsg
Tengah gonna be the next Punggol lor,btohqsg
Yes. Look at the way they are pushing out projects at tengah,btohqsg
with all the hype about intelligent homes vehicle less boulevards etc,btohqsg
"I thought this one is the ""sea-view"" one",btohqsg
LOL u go tiktok and see how many people are consoling themselves that they got Seaview.,btohqsg
Industrial area across the sea bruh,btohqsg
SG simi sea view? Pls la.... east coast see container ships all the time,btohqsg
west coast see port n cranes,btohqsg
Furniture  appliances gg. All the salt in the air.,btohqsg
maybe true sea view is Sentosa Cove??,btohqsg
Punggol is quite a nice place to be back after 8 hrs in CBD thou i feel,btohqsg
With the MRT extension to northshore,btohqsg
U see  is the image and the whole package la,btohqsg
I waiting for 2024 to get SBF,btohqsg
I waiting for my punggol too ü§≠,btohqsg
staying in resale in mature est now,btohqsg
Punggol got pros and cons la.... but on the whole is a liveable estate and relatively new,btohqsg
Every estate oso got pros n cons.... none is perfect,btohqsg
As for value good or not  as long got demand got seller,btohqsg
For resale  on the average all asking up by 50-100K  it's scary. Over the past year.,btohqsg
Haha I think now everywhere also got demand la,btohqsg
Once reach herd immunity level  all the PR flood back in  the pricing will shoot,btohqsg
You bto on St John Island also got people apply.,btohqsg
Pros n cons of SG gov do too well to control the pandemic,btohqsg
The number of millionaires in Singapore could swell 60% to 437 000 by the middle of the decade  according to Credit Suisse.https://bloom.bg/3d4Mk3j,btohqsg
just wait for greater southern waterfront BTO projects...,btohqsg
If counting HDB as asset towards the 1mil  DEFINITELY,btohqsg
I sure try as 2nd timer if I finish my MOP,btohqsg
Highly doubt have 5 rooms there,btohqsg
So many millionaires but none of them is me,btohqsg
@yhw22can advise me which is correct ? üòÖ previously we talked about NS best cause wont have the hot sun. Now see this website ü•≤,btohqsg
Can't see the stack no. Which stack u referring? Maybe can check again.,btohqsg
I based on the windows pointing to which direction to determine the sun. As long as the windows is facing either north or south. No direct hot sun.,btohqsg
Ohhh okay then think its fine. Wont wan the hot sun shining through my room .,btohqsg
Your compass direction a bit off,btohqsg
West sun is ? The hot scorching one ?,btohqsg
South supposed to be directly below  not at 8 o clock direction,btohqsg
But hard to sell next time Cose not really matured,btohqsg
Any idea how much Queenstown bto 4rm might be ü§î,btohqsg
Based on fengshui  that plot may or may not be good. It‚Äôs near hospital  petrol station and police/fire station. Need a pro to advise üòÇ,btohqsg
38 and 40 facing south-west  will have west sun about half of the year (sept to march). But depends on which floor  possible that stack 20 can provide some shade for 40,btohqsg
Was thinking about that too . Was planning to get stack 38. Will change to stack 40 then.,btohqsg
So excited about my selection unit appt tmr omg,btohqsg
Not too high and not too low,btohqsg
For 40 one bedroom wall may be hot due to west sun,btohqsg
What is the max storey for Stack 20?,btohqsg
Based on the map  not much unit is directly facing north or south.,btohqsg
It's alr partly built right? Maybe you can go to the site to get a better idea,btohqsg
I believe all is level 13 .,btohqsg
Yes finishing this year. Still not open to walk inside yet tho,btohqsg
Should be able to block the sun.,btohqsg
Hopefully ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è that block left with those 2 stacks only,btohqsg
that's because it's a loft unit,btohqsg
punggol is a nice place to stay maybe that buyer is attracted to the peace and tranquility,btohqsg
yes it is artificial but nice lah,btohqsg
but it is a nice place to retire,btohqsg
take note on the potential issue of sea level rising,btohqsg
I guess to be similar to telok blangah,btohqsg
But when beside to a PCN route  not sure will it be noisy?,btohqsg
Correct liao lor so hot now ü•≤,btohqsg
To each his or her own  I guess. Because Punggol very clusterf____ if ask me. I went for a friend's housewarming before covid last year  frankly very packed.,btohqsg
Grab / taxi drivers often quipped they can't tell ANchorvalue from Fernvale,btohqsg
haha they old school  still need Ave 1   2  3 in that exact order,btohqsg
and the block numbers to be arranged in one line,btohqsg
Dont pray pray ok  the oldies dont need GPS one hor,btohqsg
if someone young drives around daily due to job I believe he or she does not need GPS too,btohqsg
Want to ask   the grant amount stated on website. For example grant amount is $20k  cfm is $20k or (up to) $20k which might be lower ? The chart didnt state (up to) though,btohqsg
Should just be that exact amt,btohqsg
After signing & submitting  all docs cleared  should take 3-4 working days,btohqsg
Hi all  I‚Äôm a full time student and HDB HLE asked me to submit the past 6 months of income/payslip letter and 15 months of cpf contribution  I thought I just had to submit my student pass?,btohqsg
Does your other half have income at the moment? Submit his/hers and u submit your student credentials and cpf contribution history as supporting.,btohqsg
when selection  Payslip need original or photocopy will do?,btohqsg
Ok thank u very much as today go selection.,btohqsg
Yeah he‚Äôs working and I‚Äôm a student so I submitted his payslip and cpf when we applied for HLE. The application also asked to just upload my student pass which I did. Then today they messaged me asking me for further supporting documents for my cpf and payslip üò≥,btohqsg
Cause I am also working part time while studying ft and I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôll affect getting a lower hdb loan . Hmm,btohqsg
Just provide cpf docs and explain that you are not earning an income at the moment and does not have any payslips. It could be that the system is replying rigidly when the usual documents are detected as not sent.,btohqsg
U applying for hle for the purpose of unit selection only right... Not key collection.,btohqsg
Yup for flat selection in August,btohqsg
can get grant unless your partner earns > $9k!,btohqsg
Should I just make a call to HDB ..? Since I have to reupload the application online I don‚Äôt think we can not upload the documents just like that üôÅ,btohqsg
U can  but they probably will just ask u to upload the cpf docs for their records,btohqsg
Okay  thanks for your help! I‚Äôll just call to clarify first. Thanks üòÑüôèüèª,btohqsg
Nice location. I noticed the stacks are about 14 to 16 storeys. Are the projects there all about this height?,btohqsg
Also  this is my first time applying and I got a really nice number. What else should I prepare myself for (in case I missed out from hdb website/blogs) after selection of unit and paying 2K cash? Sorry if it‚Äôs been asked a lot here,btohqsg
actually can just go to the selection without any document except your IC  just tell the staff on spot you are a ft student,btohqsg
Oh can ah? The website says I need to upload the doc by July but unit selection is on Aug.,btohqsg
Hi  Have anyone come across  or heard of young married couples who apply for Public Rental Housing? (Not the Parenthood Housing Scheme),btohqsg
You mean the 2room flat for those without kids ? And 3 room if have kids ?,btohqsg
If so yeah I know a couple who got married and applied that public rental flat,btohqsg
Yup. those 1 room or 2 room. but Married couple without children only can have 1 room,btohqsg
Oh yes . 1 and 2* mixed up,btohqsg
i see. i mean  the application requirement states can apply even if household income is more than 1500,btohqsg
did they receive any kind of like interview  or phone call to assess eligibility?,btohqsg
cos the way HDB website wrote about this scheme  is more like toward elderly whose children cant house them. haha,btohqsg
They just had to submit their income documents. At that moment only 1 of them was working so they only had to submit the working one   the other was unemployed .,btohqsg
Actually yes. It‚Äôs more for those who can‚Äôt really afford the housing tbh... and the housing locations are places where most elderly stays,btohqsg
Because they won‚Äôt be eligible for housing if their income exceed the cap  so if yours exceed I don‚Äôt think you can apply for it.,btohqsg
ya that true  but i went to see some of the location and google map it  some blocks not so bad (not those with inside loong long coridoor kind),btohqsg
Thanks for some insight Shar :),btohqsg
Im trying PPHS at the moment. haha,btohqsg
homes  which is a basic need  shouldnt be so expensive  hais,btohqsg
all boils down to 'your vote matters',btohqsg
Hi  can I ask  I just received a email from hdb asking to go down to choose a unit for Nov sbf. If I will to give up the chance to go down  will it affect my chance in the May sbf?,btohqsg
Yes. If u do  u will lose one of your two First timer status.So if u do get to select a unit for may sbf  that is your last chance as a first timer.,btohqsg
Thanks! So before my selection date  if someone else choose the remaining unit  and I don't get to choose anymore  my first timer status will still remain right?,btohqsg
to answer your qns I think no affect with your chance in may sbf since the ballot result is soon to be out in the next 1 week which is before your appt..unless your appt is before the release of the May SBF results,btohqsg
since no more unit to choose your FT status remains,btohqsg
First time giving up chance to select won't have any effect on May SBF,btohqsg
Ahh I see  cant advertise is it? üòÖ,btohqsg
Try lor. Won't be that easy to implement. No capital gains taxation in Singapore.Repercussion too severe.,btohqsg
Anyone got result for sbf may 2021 ?,btohqsg
not yet  but should be in the coming days i suspect,btohqsg
Anyone got groupbuy groups to share?,btohqsg
You wanna advertise your service to them? üòÇ,btohqsg
Dont think they have group buys but their content quite useful,btohqsg
Hi  just wondering if anyone has collected keys from nov 2020 sbf?,btohqsg
Some of the ready projects in mature estates..?,btohqsg
have you logged in your hdb to check,btohqsg
Hi. Has anyone here changed their telephone point to data point? Any review?https://www.carousell.sg/p/1094656099?utm_source=copyLink&utm_medium=sharing&_branch_match_id=731850874360218547,btohqsg
Don't know about other BTO but my mum's TOP in 2007 has every bedroom  living room  kitchen and even bomb shelter equipped with the data point,btohqsg
Saves the hassle of cable exposing everywhere,btohqsg
See which bedroom needs router  just connect through the ports shown,btohqsg
I do it everyday  sometimes twice daily,btohqsg
All rooms data point are preinstall by HDB? All my friends unit are install with CAT6 cable conseal inside the wall but terminate with telephone port. They were advicing me that the wall are thick that most WiFi router are not able to cover the whole house from the main. Hence is better to get it convert.,btohqsg
So through this  the laptops and desktops in the rooms are having wired connections?,btohqsg
Haha I don't know how effective is this,btohqsg
Wifi mesh is better than router,btohqsg
OK shall try it once I shifted home,btohqsg
OK will set that up for my new home,btohqsg
To put it simple explanation  those working in big offices  they are using like mesh instead of router.If offices uses router  we all sure cannot work and the network sure jam jialat.,btohqsg
For better illustration  I'm living with my gf  my sister  my brother  my sister in law and my 2 parents,btohqsg
Everybody can stream play game and get on multiple devices without much lag,btohqsg
Data points of your house not preinstalled? No concealed cable within the walls?,btohqsg
If u do this with router  none of u are gonna do anything online,btohqsg
But still need router for wireless devices.,btohqsg
But just that this can provide stable connection to the laptops and comps,btohqsg
But OK leh my speedRouter in my bedroom which is the furthest away to the main point of the living room,btohqsg
Unless you don't need WiFi on your smartphone,btohqsg
My friends watching show and playing game from android TV box from his room and even stream 8k from YouTube. The picture is cool,btohqsg
And I think he do away those TV antenna. Just mewatch app to watch local program. Look much neater without those wire. Just dun understand why HDB has some flat install with data point and some flat install with telephone point when the line are already CAT6 Cable,btohqsg
I also want to make a spare bedroom as an entertainment room,btohqsg
With sofa bed so to accommodate any guest staying overnight,btohqsg
Hopefully the covid situation improves and maintain.,btohqsg
One person use?If no one is between you and the router  ur speed will be optimised. If you start using devices in-between your router and your further point in your room  your furthest point will get affected v badly.,btohqsg
I mean that's my experimental use for quite a few years. Cos I'm an avid gamer so latency is the one thing I hate. As my house have many people  I always have issue when trying to game with router. That's why I switch to MESH.,btohqsg
But ofcos! If this works for u then ok la. I guess there's many factors. Most importantly is you are comfortable and you are getting the most of it.,btohqsg
Sorry tech noob here  how does mesh works?,btohqsg
Only 4 person  I seldom connect to WiFi anyway  so it's technically 3 users under the household,btohqsg
Then router should work fine :),btohqsg
Hmm so a router should suffice after I shifted into my 3r flat since there would be only my wife and I staying together,btohqsg
Mesh works like how wireless@SG is.U can surf and it won't lag. But ofcos wireless@sg lag bcos they cap the speed.But if u walk around the whole building the speed is the same.,btohqsg
Yup!! Best is with antenna. It does help with amplifying the signal.,btohqsg
Ahh  so this one have to sign up with the ISP then they will set up? Currently i am using 2 routers at home to improve the signal strength in the bedrooms  with the main point (the one linked up to the fibre optics cable) being at the main door ,btohqsg
U can buy yourself from challenger.ISP have mesh also  but theirs may not be good.,btohqsg
Wth all this tech so hard to keep up with sia hahaha,btohqsg
ISP usually won't let u have it as they are a lot more costly.,btohqsg
May not subscribe to Internet since we are not gamers  just purely on 4G lol,btohqsg
But in long run I feel it's worth it,btohqsg
Depends on household.Cos we stream youtube  Netflix  Disney+ etc,btohqsg
And what's so interesting about mesh is  u can just add on and u create more point for devices to connect and u won't lag as much,btohqsg
Usually mesh comes in a set of 2 or 3.Asus Lyra(oso a mesh) comes in a set of 3.My cousin only use 2 and sold 1 to me.So my house have 3(a set) and add 1 more(from my cousin),btohqsg
And also just a point to add  signal not good can have a few basic factors.Avoid putting it near TV and near fridge,btohqsg
Tv and fridge produce eletromagnetic field which will definitely interfere with ur internet.Sometimes just shifting them a bit and ur signal is fixed.And also a NONO to put wifi (router or mesh) on the floor.,btohqsg
OK thank you very much for sharing,btohqsg
No problem! Regardless u use mesh or router  both are good as long as u don't feel frustrated and u get good value from it,btohqsg
Yah.... Think I subscribe better in case I want to connect PS online,btohqsg
Hmm so I guess is worth converting the telephone point to data point if HDB install only telephone point.,btohqsg
I have both ports by default,btohqsg
Using the houze phone is getting rarer these days right,btohqsg
When we can use social apps to do phone calls,btohqsg
I not sure if u are blind anot.dont be lazy to search,btohqsg
1.5 months is just an estimate  no actual date given.,btohqsg
Haha yup! Do hit me up if you got any issues. I do what I can to help.,btohqsg
brochures for may 2021 BTO projects are out:https://www20.hdb.gov.sg/hdbvsf/eap001.nsf/0/21MAYBTO_pdf_selection/,btohqsg
How long roughly do hdb takes to build finish a BTO carpark?,btohqsg
Oh thanks! As long as the roads and landscape are all ready?,btohqsg
As per the HDB staff  key collection is based on block completion,btohqsg
But from some home owners  the completion of the MSCP determines the key collection,btohqsg
Sorry may i know what is MSCP?,btohqsg
may sbf results not out yet right?,btohqsg
cause like usually is 6 weeks? but the email says end june,btohqsg
That'd be exactly 6 months later since the result of Nov SBF,btohqsg
Does it work this way? haha cool,btohqsg
guess we'll know in 11min hahaha,btohqsg
Received the result via email at 1611hrs though,btohqsg
After 11 mins will start a 10 year wait?,btohqsg
thank you! will update as soon as there are any updates,btohqsg
Nope.... Shortest wait should be 4-8 months,btohqsg
Like dakota breeze and pine vista,btohqsg
Waaaa alot of waiters here too ü§£,btohqsg
Apologise to applicants who were in anticipation,btohqsg
If 4+pm is not the time  then it would be another day,btohqsg
Hi everyone ..I am new here.,btohqsg
Anyone have any idea when will be the next bto launch for punggol northshow drive at waterfront view.,btohqsg
Suggest u not to look at punggol,btohqsg
The pollution at pasir gudang is very real,btohqsg
I like the waterfront punggol northshore .,btohqsg
Any waterfront bto launch in anyplace ..example like Pasir Ris or anywhere at east area,btohqsg
Just wait for greater southern waterfront project,btohqsg
There is costa grove in pasir ris back in aug 2020,btohqsg
2040 than i may be die üòÅüòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
Means for the current nursery kids era liao,btohqsg
if I‚Äôm not wrong  yeah. probably from The Straits Times article,btohqsg
anyway  I got the information from PSA. they‚Äôre shifting out and into the new Tuas Megaport by 2040,btohqsg
ya... need to wait for PSA to shift out first,btohqsg
yup  probably our children would benefit from GSW,btohqsg
and that information was pre-COVID-19. let‚Äôs see how long the delays would be...,btohqsg
Hi  can I know if anyone have the ans to this.Am I able to bring someone who is not involve with the transaction during the appointment?,btohqsg
Oh i thot of bringing my sister along to accompany me as i am the only applicant. They say only 2 person cn go in. So i thot myself n sister is oküòÖOk i will call them n check. Thanks,btohqsg
I asked before. Only people that is involved can go down,btohqsg
She can only wait outside of hdb,btohqsg
If 1 male 1 female most probably can go in together,btohqsg
Ya but they don't really check. So if 1 guy 1 girl go in together they probably think both applied together,btohqsg
For mcps near parents  parents can't go in  will be via video call,btohqsg
Ohh u nvr ask them to sign first haha,btohqsg
Ya i called them and the same answerüòÖ,btohqsg
They will check cos due to covid,btohqsg
They will check the name under the applicant and owner,btohqsg
I better b safe than sorry  just make her wait me up outsideüòÖ,btohqsg
Mine I asked my parents to sign the forms first,btohqsg
Must be involved with the transaction,btohqsg
For lease signing  only compulsory for applicant to go but I went in with my bf without issue,btohqsg
They didn't check the appointment letter,btohqsg
Lease signing haha at least I must wait outside,btohqsg
Because I have to hold the money for my mum since it'd be a big transaction,btohqsg
Just go to bank with nric to get,btohqsg
I didn't know can use cash,btohqsg
Only misc fees  AFL and key collections - SBF,btohqsg
Kns misc fees and AFL not the same day,btohqsg
Do HDB take nets  paynow or bank transfer for cash transactions? Nowadays can do very fast on phone if they allow..,btohqsg
May I know what is wifi mesh?Coz i want to recontract my plans   default must add on mesh. Min $10 per month for singtel.,btohqsg
Mesh is like an extension to your WiFi coverage.,btohqsg
But it does not function like a wifi extender.,btohqsg
Can  u can use router only. Mesh is not a must.,btohqsg
Must select one. If not cant go thru to recontract . Lol,btohqsg
Jialat.. contract gg ending this week. I also feel cancel and change telco.,btohqsg
Have u been using router all along?I just wanna help u do some simple analysis so u can later decide,btohqsg
Anyone in your household have any complaint?,btohqsg
Jus that my plan is tgt with singtel tv. I gg cancel the tv.,btohqsg
If there isn't then your usage does not warrant a mesh.,btohqsg
And most importantly  contract end doesn't mean must recontract. U can stay on as a non contract. Just find out how much per month,btohqsg
Some Telco if u never recon  the price is the same.,btohqsg
So maybe u can just stay on until u find a better deal,btohqsg
But my bf said is lagging when he use wifi.,btohqsg
Ya  will probably change for the day,btohqsg
Ya but I dun need the singtel tv. Since my dad had pass on nobody watching.,btohqsg
