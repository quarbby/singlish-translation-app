Hi. Does anyone happen to know if we rent car in JB  SG licence is acceptable or will need to apply for an International Driving Permit to drive in there?,btohqsg
international license is quite irrelevant today. even in america  they accept sinkie license. common langauge is english,btohqsg
"Ah ok cause I rented then in the invoice it wrote ""international driving permit is required"" so was wondering is it really needed or its just the typical words used in their template",btohqsg
in the past  yeah. since 2000  it's no longer required. the reason it is required last tiume is due to language barriers. today nobody asked for this anymore. i only applied it once in 2003. and i hardly used it. because car rentals never asked for it,btohqsg
Must go jb to buy? Got esim?,btohqsg
Japan and Taiwan needs International License,btohqsg
wa nicer than the old hotlink,btohqsg
Hello  am I still fit forEZ Link X TnG card?,btohqsg

Hahahaha‚Ä¶ maybe Tesla is the winner leh,btohqsg
Mazda seems to be the most mentioned brand here,btohqsg
Any further filter that this mention is by genuine or troll?,btohqsg
Only by a specific individual mainly lol,btohqsg
Hahaha‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs y systems can never replace human totally,btohqsg
Lol sounds like the whole point of this exercise was to prove this. That's pretty epic,btohqsg
Definitely genuine. Mazada number 1 brand,btohqsg
no surprise. great car gets mentioned many times...,btohqsg
not just me la. SS also mentioned,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt think so.. here only allow Mazda because it is the best car üòÇ,btohqsg
except when you need to ferry more than 2 pax lol,btohqsg
i mean this owner... is he in this channel,btohqsg
Even if he is  don't think he'll say anything,btohqsg
Aiyo mr Mazda u so cute why would anyone own up to this‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
if it's mazda i feel embarassed,btohqsg
I drive mazda only.. not mazdarati,btohqsg
If i drive toyota  change the badge to mazda  keyima?@Cxspeed,btohqsg

Where is the big brake kit caliper? Look like stock 2pot,btohqsg
Okay this makes it go faster.,btohqsg
Is it not raining wherever you are?,btohqsg
Aiyo so you wash car for nothing? Or you park under shelter,btohqsg
i am too lazy to dry it. so i leave it after wash,btohqsg
car is too big to dry it. so i rinse it and that's it. lazy way,btohqsg
Supagard's Polysilazane coating is the only maintenance free paint protection that lastsCeramic coating seems to be the craze these days  with almost every car having done it before.üëâüèª React with ‚ù§Ô∏è if you agree that ceramic coating is a must-have for your car!‚û°Ô∏èRead ithere!,btohqsg
No water marks if don't dry it?,btohqsg
the other car has water marks,btohqsg
this one i didnt really notice. maybe there are too but i didnt notice,btohqsg
I have ceramic coating  but still need to dry..haha...I thought water will just glide off...but...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ,btohqsg
they asked me to do coating. so it is not true water will just glide off?,btohqsg
Looks like a nice Mazda hahaha,btohqsg
"my friend called this car ""boss car"" due to the large size",btohqsg
Ceramic coating does give a glossier finish and I find dirt and grime much easier to clean off but the water beading doesn‚Äôt seem to last very long for me,btohqsg
Perhaps I went for the cheaper option that‚Äôs why  I see some really premium ones going for way higher prices,btohqsg
I think I paid 388 for mine? I think supaguard‚Äôs coating is slightly different compared to ceramic  I‚Äôm not very sure,btohqsg
There‚Äôs even some that can remove hairline scratches with water üò±,btohqsg
As in the coating? I can‚Äôt remember. Just happen to see it on Facebook the last time,btohqsg
The directional flow of the water makes some difference‚Ä¶noticed it glides off when I jet it at a certain direction but will still just rinse and wipe,btohqsg
actually the the clearcoat is important. it has to be HARD type that can resist scratches. this will protect,btohqsg
when i did my e30 resotration 10 years ago in malaysia  i bought my own paint and clear coat system and asked the painter to do a thorough job,btohqsg
that Glasurit paint system turned out to be incredible durable. becvause the lacquer is hard type.https://www.glasurit.com/uae/products/glasurit-923-255-hs-multi-clear,btohqsg
Lol too show off and end up in accident,btohqsg
"this is a HARD clear coat. this is key to protection. after that paint work i have never done any polishing and today it still retains the ""wet"" look",btohqsg

btw  is it possible to upgrade my system to apple car play? mine is 2016 mazda 6 2.5,btohqsg
dealer charging 500 bucks for it tho,btohqsg
evergreen looks. it has become cultish,btohqsg
how about putting this inside mazda?,btohqsg
Should be the same as yours! 6 and also white. Mine also 2016 Mazda 2.0  I upgraded apple carplay,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have to change the infotainment system  just need to change/add some hardware and upgrade the software,btohqsg
how did you upgrade car play,btohqsg
can provide links and costs to do such,btohqsg
How's the reliability of mazda - looking at mazda 6 or camry,btohqsg
Check out '[Ready Stock] Mazda CarPlay Retrofit Kit for Apple Play and Android Auto'  available at S$350 on#Carousellhttps://carousell.app.link/SZBKkUvJPpb,btohqsg
does it interfere with mazda factory system,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have any experience with the Camry but the mazda 6 has been a great daily ride! Comfortable  sporty  and I haven‚Äôt faced any issues thus far,btohqsg
That's what everyone says for mazda haha. Are you the first owner since 2016?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs almost like an ‚Äúadd on‚Äù when you connect your phone  it will automatically switch to CarPlay but you can switch it back to the Mazda interface whenever you need so that‚Äôs great because you are still able to diagnose issues with your car through the system compared to a whole new standalone infotainment system,btohqsg
my sister has  camry. it sucks. terrible car in terms of enjoyment. it i is just a bigger version of toyota vios. mazda 6 is a lot better. sporty feel and fund to drive  yet very economical,btohqsg
there is no competition. mazda wins hands down. and styling too,btohqsg
I‚Äôm not! Im the second owner but it rides so well compared to some other sedans I tried. I‚Äôve only heard issues with the auto folding side mirrors thus far though.,btohqsg
cool. that is what i want. i dont want mods or hardware or display.,btohqsg
how long have you had it,btohqsg
Hahah and it's a very uncle car too,btohqsg
guess you have not been active,btohqsg
i am for mazda or nothing,btohqsg
Yeah same thing! So I was quite glad it could be modified to add  almost like a ‚Äúhidden feature‚Äù that just required an update to unlock. I did it with the same dude so you are in good hands!,btohqsg
That's assuring haha i driving a 2009 kia forte with less than 2 years left of coe. Alot of wear and tear coming haha,btohqsg
that upgrade doesnt interfere with factory settings mazda at all and this is what i want,btohqsg
Fairly new to it  only half a year or so!,btohqsg
i got it in january 2022,btohqsg
and i am damn happy with it.,btohqsg
for a used car  such great  value,btohqsg
I compared the 2016 mazda 6 with a 2020 Kia cerato when I was shopping the last time  the Mazda fittings were much more lux and the soundproofing was much better. The kia had I think 20-30k mileage compared to 60k on the Mazda but I still felt the Mazda was very smooth,btohqsg
Kia is very powerful in the lows but seems to taper off a little when you hit 90-100 but the Mazda seems to hold its ground even after 100 although the pick up is a little weaker when starting off,btohqsg
the reviews by users has been positive,btohqsg
But that‚Äôs just my experience  could differ for other drivers/cars. Best to test drive on your own and feel it for yourself!,btohqsg
Wah. Closed the chat yesterday  just open and still on Mazda.,btohqsg
so many mazda users now yeah,btohqsg
dont ever change mazda trans oil please. dont do it...,btohqsg
That is true  i tried a 2018 kia cerato and it felt surprisingly fast during acceleration for 1.6NA. Maybe cos i compare to my own car which is slow lol,btohqsg
you got to drive hard to go fast. that is mazda,btohqsg
Another one of those ‚Äúforever‚Äù oils?,btohqsg
Cerato got throttle limiter actually. Can remove one ü§≠,btohqsg
mazda also does not recommend changing,btohqsg
my bmw m3 dct oil bmw also does not recommend chsanging,btohqsg
this aint engine oil. this lasts a long long time,btohqsg
i am 3rd owner of my mazda 6 2.5 and it is as smooth as ever,btohqsg
Hahaha yeah  it‚Äôs surprisingly powerful. Mazda has a little more ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù where it doesn‚Äôt really kick off but gradually accelerates but stays steady throughout,btohqsg
Another car I'm looking at is lexus GS250,btohqsg
to drive mazda fast  drive it hard. the engine is tuned for low revv at 2400 rom most of the time cruising at say 120,btohqsg
so i aint alone la. so many here say mazda good.,btohqsg
Petrol very expensive  don‚Äôt need go so fast la HAHA,btohqsg
yeah i got nearly 800 km for a full tank,btohqsg
Wah not bad! The last I checked I was about 700km,btohqsg
You are comparing wrongly  luxury sedan and entry level sedan,btohqsg
Definitely! I mean  one is 1.6 and another is 2.0. I‚Äôm just comparing based on what I was shopping around for and the rides I tested and@kopiokosongpengis riding a Kia,btohqsg
Good car but eat too much petrol and not worth for road tax also,btohqsg
1 2 33 2 1Mazada number 1,btohqsg
Just out of curiosity‚Ä¶ is there Mazda chat ?,btohqsg
That's why it will stay as my dream because dont make sense unless got too much money haha,btohqsg
They're 2 school of thought wgt this. Many discussions in mz6 WhatsApp group,btohqsg
Think there are tons of telegram/whatsapp groups for different brands and models,btohqsg
If you are in one  ask your fellow members to join us! ü§≠,btohqsg

Wow. Looks huge. Same size as Mazda 6 2.5. 19‚Äù,btohqsg
Cx5 has larger tank. Mine is 62 liters,btohqsg
More. Mine is at least 750. Average 770,btohqsg
I drive Honda streamFull tank get around 61058 litre tank,btohqsg
Oh 2.5 still get 750 wah,btohqsg
Must consider for my upgrade in 2 months,btohqsg
How can it be? I expect 700,btohqsg
Plus remaining mileage  ard 600* lah,btohqsg
He will psycho u to buy mazda,btohqsg
You got to calculate actual. Fill up to the brim. Reset and measure and then full up to take file user.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt. I only recommend great car. Really. The fuel economy for a luxury car is considered fantastic,btohqsg
U mean u measure a full tank mileage?,btohqsg
Then ard 700+  but actual mileage is lower,btohqsg
When it reaches 0 range on the gauge I go on to drive another 40km. Then I refuel. And it only takes 57 liters!!!,btohqsg
So the fuel warning gives you ample range to refuel. I suspect 80 to go still,btohqsg
So my measurement is very accurate.,btohqsg
Wah‚Ä¶ fierce‚Ä¶ every time  left 150km  I will go and pump,btohqsg
My fuel consumption never falls below 12.5 km a liter,btohqsg
After I refuel  it immediately shows 760-780km range approximately. Sometimes 810.,btohqsg
You exhibit sinkies kiasuism. You live up to it,btohqsg
But I do this in order to find out the truth,btohqsg
Then I don‚Äôt panic la in future when this happens,btohqsg
ok. This one new model lah,btohqsg
You won‚Äôt change to other brands?,btohqsg
I trust ur words  mazda is the best,btohqsg
Big car a challenge to park,btohqsg
Since he‚Äôs also a bmw fan  you can believe what he says about Mazda.,btohqsg
Curious what made you switch to this brand? From Audi?,btohqsg
Not really‚Ä¶ cx9 may be difficult‚Ä¶ but cx8 is not,btohqsg
Cx8 is the same width as mazda6,btohqsg
Probably@SGCM_Admincan remind members this is a generic car interest chatgroup and not a particular car make chatgroup? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong.,btohqsg
Yea  seems like VW and Audi people like me are left out of the conversation. I actually particular with any make of cars but my inking is towards the Germans,btohqsg
Enough years of driving. No car is best car. No brand is best brand. If really like this  whole world only one type can sell Liao. Also seldom see Hyundai and Kia folks. New Tucson also very modern. Good space  drive train stays on electric a lot  can do almost 1k km per tank.,btohqsg
Audi quite pricy amongst the big 4. Ad showroom too fierce. Need to sell more exp to cover cost.,btohqsg
Yeah you can chat whatever brands you like. Just talk. Don‚Äôt keep quiet.,btohqsg
@SGCM_Adminthis kind of chat is definitely out! SPAM!,btohqsg
Lol. Got code to prevent word filtering ü§≠,btohqsg
He has been caught xx times and cursed but he still tries,btohqsg
German cars build quality is definitely solid. Just that reliability and cost of upcoming are major concern for most.,btohqsg
Not sure why got such ‚Äújacky Loh‚Äù,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/ueGoScRwCp8Here‚Äôs a good German. Driving over 300 is like cruising. Damn.,btohqsg
They are like Covid-19  evolved to become new variant and start to infect others. Our@SGCM_Adminis like our antibodies or vaccines.,btohqsg
It need more care and love,btohqsg
Isn‚Äôt it applies to all cars in Singapore? Car is so expensive here. Hee Hee,btohqsg
Actually I'm driving a Hyundai Elantra S. I prefer to let the Quiet Achiever speak for itself. Never brag or put down other owners who are singing praises about theirs. I have owned several brands of cars both continental  Japanese and now Korean in my 38 years of driving. My 2 cents worth is that Hyundai has both worlds combined into their models. Also not a petrol guzzler either. Have a Good Sunday All. üëç,btohqsg
How about the reliability of Hyundai or Kia? Looks like they have their fair shares of reliability issues and value for money,btohqsg
Well I guess No cars are without problems along the way. So in terms of reliability I have had not had any problems what's so ever till now. Touch wood. In fact it's such a joy and reasonably cheaper parts than Japanese and the more costly continental cars.,btohqsg
Is it cheaper than the Japs? I was told Korean parts quite ex,btohqsg
Sometimes the owner makes a difference as well. Some don‚Äôt maintain the car or rough handles it,btohqsg
Anyway Koreans have improved a lot,btohqsg
If its a mazda  even if its grossly mishandled  its fine.,btohqsg
I do have a question about hatchbacks  does anyone have any recommendations on how you can increase the safety aspects for the rear passenger area in the event that the car is rear ended.,btohqsg
Get sedan version lor. HB design already fixed shaped. How you want to cushion more perhaps put more foams in the boot. üòÇ,btohqsg
Prefer hatchbacks safety of rear passengers is the only drawback,btohqsg
On a serious note  if you are so concern with safety for rear passengers  perhaps don‚Äôt carry them,btohqsg
Use the rear space for cargo better,btohqsg
Same thing for those mpv having to occupy the last row for passengers.,btohqsg
Not at all. Depending on the part you change though.,btohqsg
I concur. In the eye of the beholder. Got 4-wheels can go anywhere is good enough.,btohqsg
When young  got 4-wheels can fetch babes. When grow older can fetch family. When grow old  can travel on 4-wheels is a blessing.,btohqsg
Aiya just enjoy when we get old we will be on the either manual two hand push or the 2hp motorized wheelchair,btohqsg
Agreed that Korean cars improved a lot but their prices also increase quite a fair bit,btohqsg
I'm glad there are other brands such as Mazda besides Toyota,btohqsg
Heard Hyundai AD is better. Don‚Äôt have so many conditions to get promo price.,btohqsg
They've improved leaps and bounds since Hyundai Pony era. That was their first model in SG if I remember back in the 80s,btohqsg
KIA cars are very identical to Hyundai in fact they almost share parts cause well they are from the same parent company.,btohqsg
Yes they are the same parent company. So are some of their parts. Besides the performance  they are getting more sleeker and sexier in their appearance and futuristic technologies as well. üëçüèΩ,btohqsg
I think the VW group is even worst than Peugeot‚Ä¶ talking about 7 to 10 years üöó,btohqsg
Yup.i totally agree. Not acclimatised for Singapore use  as most continental cars including the popular models here have chronic parts failure time and time again. Never ending.,btohqsg
cause got more parts and performance,btohqsg
Good morning sir. We have deleted and banned that user,btohqsg
At least i don‚Äôt see vw having more problems of small small things like console screen blackout  console screen freeze  door frame cracking due to misalignment.. to be specific.. renault,btohqsg
Any idea about Seat and Skoda?,btohqsg
Same‚Ä¶.their hatch locks always spoil‚Ä¶and little little things lah‚Ä¶. Ok not so little when it comes to repairing‚Ä¶ like buttons etc,btohqsg
Things that u never imagine will spoil in Japanese will spoil in the VW,btohqsg
My 308 had a spoilt power window motor‚Ä¶ and I understand that the Japanese ones seems to be interchangeable (like exchange the rear ones to the front) but the French are distinct so must repair,btohqsg
My Golf central lock spoil   hatch lock and hazard light button spoil‚Ä¶..the VRS (2010) also similar problems,btohqsg
As long as engine and transmission no problem is really ok lah‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
I had the same problem with chevrolet. Got into trouble at Singapore customs last time when I arrived from JB. Customes officer thought i was trying to be funny. Finally managed to umlock after being pulled over and waited 30mins. So frustrated and then waited over 1 month for parts to arrive. Notced the boot loblck malfunction on hot and sunny weather when parked outdoors and not a problem indoors.,btohqsg
Oh yah at least the old golf  front headlights‚Äô wires casing seems to be melted by the heat so in the last couple of years may be dangerous‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Hahah ya lor‚Ä¶ it happens‚Ä¶.I mean it‚Äôs not a big thing but sianz lor,btohqsg
euro cars have these kinds of annoying problems.,btohqsg
they do not test things thoroughly,btohqsg
simple things like wheel studs design is just not as thoughtful as the japanese. euro cars tend to use wheel bolts  instead of wheel nuts like japanese do. i have endured years of wheel bolts on the bmws. terrible thing when mounting tires  often needing assistence. on the japanese design  tires can be easily mounted. all you need to do is to tighten the nuts.,btohqsg
this is better. easier to work on when mounting tires,btohqsg
this is typical euro style like bmw. hard to mount wheel without support,btohqsg
Err‚Ä¶ jap car change branded jap rims also need to use centrebore ring adapter leh..,btohqsg
Yes yes. We will take care because it‚Äôs that exp. ü§≠,btohqsg
Many people watch the video. Good income,btohqsg
Actually those no backside car generally have strengthen rear ends. Don‚Äôt have to worry too much,btohqsg
Yes. They even accept no loan purchase. Which some people like. A lot of ad force loan. Pml is one,btohqsg
Have not been in that situation thankfully  but it‚Äôs occasionally at the back of the mind.,btohqsg
I think they need to ban key word ‚Äújackyloh‚Äù üòÇ,btohqsg
Filter words like WhatsApp with phone number,btohqsg
What‚Äôre you talking about?  It‚Äôs referring to wheel nuts versus wheel bolts,btohqsg
I noticed increasingly cars like Porsches are switching to the Japanese methods,btohqsg
Whereas bmw still follows their old ways. Using wheel bolts,btohqsg
i definitely prefer the japanese way! easier to guide wheel for me to tighten. if you change tires yourself you will know what i mean.,btohqsg
Vw is using normal nuts  bmw just being bmw lo,btohqsg
I dont see why people have to be shamed for this leh,btohqsg
Not that they are stealing or what,btohqsg
Cuz make them feel like cheapo in Malaysia‚Ä¶ trying to max out the cheap fuel‚Ä¶But the article also said that he was doing that for years in singapore too‚Ä¶ so i think it‚Äôs more to save the trip to the petrol station than saving money.,btohqsg
i see no issues so long they pump 97 ah,btohqsg
Its just human perspective  i also sometimes shake my car in Singapore to hit the minimum coupon spending amount,btohqsg
makes them look stupid. who in the world would do that,btohqsg
when doing this kind of silly thing clearly wont help,btohqsg
It would actually  but not practical.,btohqsg
you know wheel bolts versus wheel nuts? the diff,btohqsg
I know Mazda is the best,btohqsg
VW and BMW use wheel bolts. same,btohqsg
you are being juvenile here. i am talking objective here.,btohqsg
LOL says one who is being in denial,btohqsg
it is difficult to guide wheel to tighten when mounting.,btohqsg
Your house got mirror? When your birthday?,btohqsg
you are being childish this way,btohqsg
yes. a a pain when mounting wheel back. need a guide,btohqsg
because i do this manually often. when i saw tireman do he also has to do a few times to position the holes,btohqsg
Nah  just echoing your nonstop self praise of mazda,btohqsg
that is what i said same. but that guy says different,btohqsg
Anyway god bless you with your 2.5L mazda  its the best.. ciao,btohqsg
Maybe newer platofrm is different. This is from 50 years ago afterall.,btohqsg
notning to do with mazdA. this is wheel tightening methods used by nissan toyota mazda perodua japanese cars,btohqsg
The front disc brake is the size of Altis rear brakes. lol,btohqsg
you are being chilidsh and honestly stupid.,btohqsg
This one my experience not too good unless you run the soap rich,btohqsg
almost all the euro  cars are like that. makes mounting wheel back a pain.,btohqsg
$11‚Ä¶ I just buy and try,btohqsg
I read the reviews  like not bad,btohqsg
Dont expect the same foam bath you find in car wash shops can le.,btohqsg
I know  don‚Äôt have that expectation,btohqsg
The foam level is similar when you shower yourself.,btohqsg
i have this. brand is kartcher. i find it lousy. the bottle is too small. when used with the pressure jet  it finishes in no time,btohqsg
Do you have access to those hdb jets ?,btohqsg
This one not use with pressure jet. This one hand pump. Need hand job.,btohqsg
If you do buy those cheap attachments,btohqsg
But this one is bottle itself‚Ä¶ not the spray attachment,btohqsg
Works perfectly well and it‚Äôs small,btohqsg
yes/. hand pump. but i think after a while wont use anymore. because it is slow,btohqsg
even waterless wash will be faster lol,btohqsg
you guys dont send cars to car wash?,btohqsg
these days i also become lazy to use the pressure jet. it is just spur of moment thing to buy. but that kartcher is very very useful when you want to do spring cleraning say chinese new year washing.,btohqsg
I only send to the car wash I trusted. Petrol station ones usually CMI,btohqsg

I mean new car look after coating maintenance‚Ä¶  not getting new car,btohqsg
repair the fuel gauge la. search internet to get part to replace. make it complete repair,btohqsg
Going back workshop. Fuel gauge change le but still not accurate LOL,btohqsg
that's the idea. can go to jb to refuel cheap,btohqsg

Really? Volvo quality improved under the Chinese? Saw some Vloggers giving bad reviews on XC90,btohqsg
The interior quality really good  can't deny. Test drove the xc60 t5 last year and it was really smooth.,btohqsg
My ex colleague owned the previous version XC60  maintenance cost on average was $1k whenever it‚Äôs in the workshop after warranty. Decided to switch to Subaru Forester.,btohqsg
Reviews on performance or interior quality? I just like the styling under geely,btohqsg
"Volvo reliability is pretty solid from a volvo owner for the past 20+ years.. newer volvo are defo abit less ""tank like"" but are still as reliable as ever",btohqsg
That will be before it‚Äôs under Geely,btohqsg
I know of someone who repaired the Volvo DCT 3 times each time costing 2-3k. It‚Äôs a 7 year old xc70,btohqsg
The older gen Volvo and Mercedes are damn solid beast.,btohqsg
Volvo at that time used the Ford DCT which was undoubtedly unreliable... Post 2012  Volvo has not been plagued with any serious issues,btohqsg
These days  they build cars to breakdown so manufacturers can sell spare parts when breakdown?,btohqsg
Still using the DCT as it was following the P2 platform,btohqsg
P3 and SPA platform are solid without any major issues,btohqsg
Ioniq 5 is nice wait for that,btohqsg
Interesting  because I've heard horror stories of Forester maintanence too,btohqsg
Just depends on how you maintain the car and drive as well I think,btohqsg
Heard of a Forester owner who did around 65 to 70k in a few years and his gearbox died. Needed to change the whole unit. Another one who's aircon completely shut off,btohqsg
Yeah man agreed... boxers are known to be slightly less reliable when preventive maintenance is not done,btohqsg
"Not covered in warranty either because they ""missed a service at the agent"" but always service at the agent",btohqsg
Can put up my lexus here for sale?,btohqsg
any Sienta hybrid driver drove up to genting before ? enough power to reach the top ?,btohqsg
Then eat happened to the COEs that people bidded  how can so little car sold when COE issued were so much more?,btohqsg
Nowadays car are so efficient  that why I always said the speed limit is too outdated   in actual fact nowadays cars are way too powerful haha,btohqsg
haha back to the good ol times when the ford model T was sufficient,btohqsg
This is not included as new COEs issued... These are under PQP which is based on 3 months average,btohqsg
but our sienta hybrid is not that powerful. üòÖ just to ask any bro here have experience driving up and share their views üòä,btohqsg
I thought u asking how come so little car is been purchased and where did the coe go to ? So I assumed it should went to cars that renew coe,btohqsg
Is more then enough I can confirm at most your rpm is at 3000 all the way,btohqsg
No  the renewal of COE is not included in the issuance of new COE... New COE is based on the numbers of car scrapped and LTA's allowance for vehicle growth.,btohqsg
Or maybe the data is onlyFor ad only have to read the fine prints,btohqsg
even with 1 driver and 4 adults on boards ? üòÖ,btohqsg
Agree  cars are powerful and stable to maintain slightly higher speeds but are the drivers trained and capable enough to manage them? Food for thought. Btw I'm all for a speed limit increase but just another point of view,btohqsg
Shouldn't be any issue to go up as I used to drive a 600cc car up there but certain part of the uphill slope need to use 3 gear,btohqsg
cool üòé üÜíÔ∏è üòéany passengers onboard,btohqsg
Should be fine sir! Genting not as steep as the Top Gear stunt dam! Sienta should work out  enjoy your trip!,btohqsg
Actually a lot of accident is due to frustration and cars moving too slow   most of the time I also get wander off as the traffic is really too slow   I can even look at the other lane   and other cars,btohqsg
genting is no kick to toyota they are solid machine üòé,btohqsg
Case in point right there  if you're getting bored while driving because traffic is slow. Probably shouldn't be driving at that point. Driving is all about patience and focus. Both of which are required more and more as the speed increases,btohqsg
Sir  if you driving  please look ahead. Dont get distracted and let your mind float away.#DriveSlowDriveSafe,btohqsg
actually I drove up KL last weekend and along the way I don't find similar model along the NSHW which makes me worry is this model suitable in Malaysia üòÖ,btohqsg
coming long weekend  aiming to drive up genting with 5pax on board üòé,btohqsg
Ya I understand but is really too slow   just look at at traffic light interval at turning right   how slow the cars move and how long the traffic light interval is . I hope the traffic light interval be like 50% faster and put in timer   so driver can concentrate and move off faster then taking own sweet time   some time a green turn right arrow only 3-4 cars past thru and got to wait another 5 minutes,btohqsg
The timer is actually counter productive because it'll make people see got few seconds left and speed up to beat the light which can be the cause of a crash again. Just depends on different drivers and what they're comfortable doing  all about patience again. Sometimes drivers may not have visibility of oncoming traffic on a blank arrow so they wait  which is understandable. Traffic light timings really depend on traffic conditions as well  timing changes throughout the day!,btohqsg
Agree with your point about the waiting though  sometimes can be annoying if you're rushing somewhere but I guess we just have to deal with it because all people using the roads ü§óü§ó,btohqsg
i agree with you Mr Arnav. Patience is a virture. Those few minutes spend may prevent a potentially fatal accident. Thks for your insightüòãüòã,btohqsg
If u notice most of the driver are not focusing on road while waiting for green light   some are in park gear   and when the light turn green   they have to take engage back to drive   and this lead to chain effect of mass delay,btohqsg
With timer at least they can be more prepared,btohqsg
While in Seattle I notice how fast the traffic light interval is   and the traffic is smoother   our traffic light interval really is unnesscary too long,btohqsg
That's true  but I guess that is just our local driver nature at times. A short honk is usually enough to wake them up from their TikTok/Facebook scrolling sessions.,btohqsg
If you look at the American intersection system you might also see how much bigger their roads are and how spaced out people are. Really cannot compare  different driving dynamics altogether,btohqsg
I mean on the small road   u press the green man button within 10 plus second it will be green man,btohqsg
When traffic is light having fast interval is really making traffic smoother   then to pile up a long stretch of cars  and the car that had had the pole start is a slow and road hogger the traffic jam is even worse,btohqsg
Road hogging issue is actually getting worst and cars behind them built up frustration and can lead to accident,btohqsg
Slow moving off   slow acceleration  maintain low speed,btohqsg
They think they are safe driver   but cars behind them is really frustrated   that why u see so many tail gating,btohqsg
what if they old people haha give chance luh,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt tail gate   I just endure with the frustration and over take if condition allow,btohqsg
I would say as long as the person isn't too slow like under 35 in a 50. It's still ok because you don't know what their skill level is plus if they have older people in the back who need a smoother ride etc. And going off lines  not every car has high torque to go off quick and people don't floor it everywhere I guess. Tailgating is what leads to the accident actually not the slow moving car in front. If the cars behind can maintain distance  you will be safe and then overtake the car when you have a chance,btohqsg
Mr Simple Guy  I am also inclined to agree with you. Road Hogging has been a very serious issue as of late. Too many road users believe that lane 1 is to travel at the speed limit which is a common ‚ùåMISCONCEPTION‚ùå.This kind of behaviour makes expressway INEFFICIENT  really inconsiderate. I am sure more needs to be done to educate road users on road ettiquete.,btohqsg
Yes one of the way to tackle road hogging is increase speed limit to 110 km,btohqsg
Is it safe? or should we all use TESLA AUTOPILOT to drive?,btohqsg
Most of the country are also at 110 km   Singapore road infrastructure is so good but limit is at 80-90   with modern Car technology and the amount of cars   80-90 is just way too slow,btohqsg
And then what  we will have people driving at 110 in lane 1 and others who still want to go faster,btohqsg
I hear home loan rates now up 1% this year,btohqsg
What do we do then  just an endless cycle at that point  what's needed is road etiquette for this case and the concept of giving way,btohqsg
Will hit 3%by this year easily,btohqsg
Gonna put a lot of pressure. Expect coe the o fall,btohqsg
Our country is not give way but to speed up,btohqsg
I also heard the PM Lee said that recession is coming   hence there might be no reason to implement the 110kmh speed limit as this will cause people to burn more petrol hence effecting economy once again.,btohqsg
excatly sadly like this hard to increase limit haha,btohqsg
Cars now a days driving at 110Km is also below 2 k rpm,btohqsg
if limit is 110 and people dont give way its a recipe for accidents,btohqsg
I am inclined to agree with you Mr Arnav. What measure do you think can be implemented? SkilsFuture lesson on road etiquette?,btohqsg
Just driver behavior  increasing speed limit will not solve it,btohqsg
I propose penalize the road joggers till they change to slow lane to become habits,btohqsg
Nope the middleLane won‚Äôt travel that fast,btohqsg
And it is easy to cut,btohqsg
if they are people pushing 100 nowadays hard to say uh boss,btohqsg
This is a very good idea. Maybe can propose to Government,btohqsg
Haha. So true. They think you want to chase them,btohqsg
No wonder so many people selling,btohqsg
U did not notice that now hard to overtake is because overtaking lane is the same speeed as the lorry in the middle lane ?,btohqsg
They think giving way is lesser behavior,btohqsg
Will write to my MP. thks. Rgrds.,btohqsg
If overtaking lane is at 110 it is easy to overtake the middle lane,btohqsg
The whole issue is that people will continue to stick to lane 1 and drive at the speed limit instead of giving way,btohqsg
Noted on the support given. Will do the same with me MP too. Best regards.,btohqsg
You increase to 110  people want to go 130 in lane 1  endless cycle,btohqsg
But it is easy to over take   and don‚Äôt need to over take at 1110,btohqsg
end up singapore will become autobahn haha,btohqsg
Dont we all love CTE to be our next NSHW?,btohqsg
but cannot control people mah some people confirm leg itchy will overtake above 110 :(,btohqsg
U look at Malaysia also is at 110 most sg driver enjoy driving there,btohqsg
If overtaking lane is 110  middle lane is also 110,btohqsg
Actually Subaru Forester is very solid car and reliable. They‚Äôve won many awards in reliability in America. I tested this car many many years ago on behalf of a buyer who wanted to buy. Suspension feel is great. I wonder why not reliable today,btohqsg
most sg drivers enjoy cos they go above 110 hahahaha,btohqsg
Cause 80-90 is really too low,btohqsg
Is it because many years ago?,btohqsg
Beg to differ  can see lorries and hiace driving at 110 at many times,btohqsg
This I never see 99% of the time,btohqsg
Most of them is 70-80 plus,btohqsg
Malaysia highways relatively empty  especially the ones most SG drivers are on. Singapore is a smaller country less room more cars,btohqsg
I have seen way too many EJ engine blowing up  not sure about you tho,btohqsg
More cars using the same stretches everyday also,btohqsg
I see alot of cars at ecp going at 200,btohqsg
Yes. At least ten years ago. It was very good. Wrx Forrestor all solid machines,btohqsg
With higher speed can reduce the congestion at peak period,btohqsg
yes i agree wrx is solid car,btohqsg
My friend had a wrx and he let me drive for a while it‚Äôs very comfortable to drive. Good daily driver,btohqsg
did you like the fuel consumption?,btohqsg
The suspension feelIs very good. Rock solid build too,btohqsg
If everyone at higher speeds  all moving together mate,btohqsg
The issue is giving way and driving etiquette not speeds,btohqsg
cannot control some people who will cut in and out mah,btohqsg
agree with this good point mr arnav!,btohqsg
I think you buy wrx you don‚Äôt calculate fuel consumption one,btohqsg
One who wants to road hog will continue to do so at 110  one who wants to drive fast in lane 1 will continue to do so,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt know. I didn‚Äôt  drive long enough. But it‚Äôs good enough to leave me positive impression. He says it‚Äôs damn good on the wet,btohqsg
ah yes all subarus good in wet regardless of engine cos of the symmetrical awd,btohqsg
Driving etiquette is hard   most of the taxi and coe cars drive like gangster road hogger,btohqsg
Yes absolutely. We got to have education.,btohqsg
handling really miles ahead of other cars,btohqsg
yep  calculate number of head gaskets needed,btohqsg
Education don‚Äôt work for every 1,btohqsg
Yupp  and that's what needs to be improved. Speed limit increase for everyone  same issue will stick around,btohqsg
precisely  if singaporeans got no driving etiquette  increasing speed limit will be dangerous,btohqsg
Maybe we can use such chat to promote day to day education to new drivers entering as well ?,btohqsg
Just need to inculcate the right driving rules from the start  road etiquette more than hill climbs,btohqsg
I was driving a 156 Alfa and I chased him to 180 plus. And that‚Äôs where he pulls away easily when I am running out of steam at 220 plus,btohqsg
The salesman tell me the rear view mirror don‚Äôt need too big too. Coz your handling so good plus speed you will be leaving everyone behind,btohqsg
Need to have driving etiquette course on how to use signal light...,btohqsg
they say no need big rear view mirror cos workshop got nothing to see too,btohqsg
There is never a blanket solution for all  different people  different mood  different skills  different cars,btohqsg
Why u drive so fast lol,btohqsg
That's why  need to deal with the issues  all paying road tax,btohqsg
all jokes and banter  i do love a good subie too btw when its road ready,btohqsg
And not change Lane dangerously without signaling. Only when can't cut  then signal light on...,btohqsg
Ya some time just too mad with road hogger I got a video of how a car block me !,btohqsg
180 plus not that fast ok north south highways.,btohqsg
I use Mazda to do this often too,btohqsg
I give way to faster car,btohqsg
Yeahh  just need to flash them and try to move forward! No choice,btohqsg
my friend ignatius managed to hit 240 on nshw in 2010  he drive tat gtr with v6,btohqsg
You are a good man sir. üëç,btohqsg
need more drivers like you on the road!,btohqsg
maybe his leg feeling extra heavy haha,btohqsg
I always do. Even in m3 I give way to myvy. I think he‚Äôs in a hurry,btohqsg
wow! m3 driver! cool solid car,btohqsg
U flash them they hog more come I show you,btohqsg
Got to have good tires when driving fast  Clear and open roads,btohqsg
e92 m3? heard the NA V8 very powerful,btohqsg
But I dare not do 300. Many YouTubers do 320 330. My top speed I ever tried is 255,btohqsg
Yes. That‚Äôs the one. Yeah glorious sound.,btohqsg
you really winner own my dream car,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a touring machine. Or do 250 in 6th so that engine revv stays high,btohqsg
Then overtake from left very politely and safely,btohqsg
More and more junctions doing away with discretionary right turn. Taking longer time for both road users and pedestrians,btohqsg
I've been trying the new tourador tyres and it's performing well.,btohqsg
I recently like Yokohama. Sidewalls very strong and stable.,btohqsg
Less than 6 km a liter. Ouch,btohqsg
Can share picture of your beautiful ride Mr Win?,btohqsg
wrx average 7 sometimes haha with boxer 4,btohqsg
my friend jing xun drives a e63 i heard how is the driving experience like sir?@Jingxunn,btohqsg
I've been reading and many people are saying tyres are all the same. That is why many new brand can perform better than branded ones hence I've chosen tourador.  Maybe one day you can try.,btohqsg
My friend tell me got discount if you put decal one. Is it true?,btohqsg
Yes yes! This is very good initiative from the company. I share many of my friends go try already. All very happy.,btohqsg
heard the sticker hold down the windshield better  can provide better aerodynamic,btohqsg
Some would say it is unsafe,btohqsg
Sure. This is the bmw m5 class. Large engine powerful torque abs power,btohqsg
m3 better leh i feel more loved by all in singapore üòç,btohqsg
@winman16share share! Would love to see your ride!,btohqsg
Actually engine loves it when you revv long at bear redline. Blasts put carbons. And becomes very efficient,btohqsg
Highway running engine usually is very good,btohqsg
good mann  cant be an NA V8 from the E92.. love to have one but scared of rod bearings,btohqsg
M3 is 2 door. Not practical,btohqsg
i love e63 man! 5.5l v8 cannot be topped bro!,btohqsg
Anything practical if you say no to a few people üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I believe he is referring to the very new brand tesla in Singapore. The ceo is Elon musk very talented young man.,btohqsg
Rod bearings issue is commonly discussed but I didn‚Äôt do it. I think those drivers didn‚Äôt heat up engine oil properly first. Why? Because the v8 takes a real long time to heat up. 8.8 liters of oil,btohqsg
So if oil is not properly warmed up and you whacked the engine bearings failure,btohqsg
I‚Äôm my case it takes nearly 5 minutes to achieve ‚ÄúOK‚Äù temperature status,btohqsg
And it takes 10W60 thick oil. Even worse right. Takes longer time to travel,btohqsg
But once oil is hot yeah revv all you want. That‚Äôs why suitable for track use,btohqsg
Elon not young and tesla is 10Plus years le just young in sg,btohqsg
drive safe everyone! going to join my friends to go rounding now! slow legal cruise! my WRX warm up finish alr!,btohqsg

I also do grab food. Selection very good and yummy.,btohqsg
I've yet to try. Maybe one day I'll try when times are better.,btohqsg
Where got so good one? Can I change to their brand too?,btohqsg
Bmw brand engine oil. I think they probably work with Castrol,btohqsg
that‚Äôs great  what‚Äôs your mode of transport?,btohqsg
i know of a buddy who does grab with a GTI lovely fella,btohqsg
There‚Äôs a Reddit forum American users use 7 years doing 200000 miles without changing. But asked if need to change. He says trans as smooth as day 1,btohqsg
Swedish Volvo and Chinese Volvo very different leh,btohqsg
Spark plugs Trans fluids last a long long time,btohqsg
if you are talking about SPA generation  definitely have... but i am currently driving chinese volvo and its still upholds its legacy,btohqsg
Many do grab because they‚Äôre bored. Who knows can meet passengers who can talk cars!,btohqsg
Same la. Chinese leave this to Swedish,btohqsg
Before this chinese was a belgian volvo  same like sweden and chinese also pretty solid,btohqsg
This is perhaps the only mass market brand i have not tried.,btohqsg

Should üò∑have extended the COE :(,btohqsg
Lane 1 supposed to be an overtaking lane and normal driving should be on 2nd lane and maintain at speed limit... I have several Incidents  the car in front of me just driving at 70km/h in KPE on lane one and without turning on the lights  cars in lane 2 were driving around 70+km/h  flashed the guy  but driver seem oblivious to this and just maintain the speed. Frustrated?,btohqsg
Me waiting for this as my car is in the final year  thought to just renewing COE,btohqsg
This is in place but nowadays traffic police don't summon people for this  about 10 years ago  driving along AYE near Clement  stopped by TP for going too slow on 2nd lane  was driving around 70km/h in the afternoon. No warning  just issue summon  kena $70.00 plus 4 points,btohqsg
Subaru‚Äôs VX and Tribeca are pretty problematic from friends who used to drive these model. Not much complaining from people who drives Forrester  except fuel consumption.,btohqsg
Forester is kinda powerful for it price   maybe that why the fc,btohqsg
Petrol expensive mah üòô some people want to drive slow thinking everyone also same. Especially hybrid taxis. I also realise they are aware they hogging. Because if u want to overtake them. U see their car lean into your lane  shows they are looking at the mirrors,btohqsg
These people sibei selfish hor. They never think the people behind might be rushing wife to hospital to give birth  rushing for meetings  parents fall down at home. At least be aware of people are faster behind and just move out and let people pass,btohqsg
ya drive so slow   same speed as middle lane  just move 1 side la  why so selfish and block ppl,btohqsg
it is os hard to over take  because the speed limit is too low  and the overtaking lane car is always travelling at the same speed as the middle lane,btohqsg

what problems are you talking about? i said there are no problems.,btohqsg
that sounds like you are worrying too much. like you think gearbox oil needs to be changed because you think it ought to,btohqsg
then why dont you change engine oil every week? that kind of analogy,btohqsg
Change at recommended interval is sufficient,btohqsg
did you read long term users what they say about the car and reliability?,btohqsg
So how long before u change out your engine oil,btohqsg
I seen people driving till 15k-20k before changing or once a year,btohqsg
Maximum 15 000kmOil filter only last 15 000km,btohqsg
10 000 ‚Äì 15 000kmThe regular service interval for oil filters is generally 10 000 ‚Äì 15 000km or six months to one year  depending on whichever comes first. Sakura Filters Australia says it is best to consult your log book service manual for correct service intervals.,btohqsg
The Bosch Long Life Oil Filter is built to last for¬†10 000 miles¬†on vehicles that use synthetic and semi-synthetic motor oils.,btohqsg
Oil Change Rules:Car models from 2008 or a few years after should get it changed every 5 000-7 500 miles. Cars made several years after 2008 should be safe to get it changed every 7 500-10 000 miles. If you drive aggressively you might want to change it sooner rather than later.https://hondakingsport.com‚Ä∫,btohqsg
