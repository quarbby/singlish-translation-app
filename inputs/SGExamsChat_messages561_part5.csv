Must ask the bell curve god,btohqsg
I thought I did well for POA  I got B3,btohqsg
go temple go church go idk where,btohqsg
Actually now so many years later  I can explain a bit why need that high. It's not because of the bell curve  it is because many students have actually very poor presentation.You may think you are correct  but poor presentation leads to loss of marks  to the extent of dropping a grade or 2,btohqsg
so.... if you are doing well already  good. Last step is to focus heavily on logical presentation of ideas to finally achieve the answer.Mathematics presentation is actually giving an argument (similar to argumentative essay) in mathematical language.,btohqsg

sg students are good at maths so the bellcurve changed sm,btohqsg
