🚀Pika World Breakfast Bite- 20 May 2022🚀🧨A lost momentum for stocks🍎It was a big swing between gains and losses throughout the trading session. As a result  the stocks could not hold on to a significant rally as major indices dived towards the end of the session. Driving such sell-off is the concern of inflation such that it eats into corporate profit and slower economic growth. This is most evident in big retailers' earnings results from Walmart and Target. They showed a rising revenue but declining earnings.🧯The hammer hit across the board⛏The sell-off seen in the equity market appears to be broad-based. If we looked at the ETF  XLP  which comprises Consumer Staples  had fallen by 6.4% on Wednesday. It had seen outperformance in 2022 but is giving up a significant portion of the gains. The bear markets come to every sector  and thus  groups that have been holding relatively well may be the next hit. And if it does happen  we might be leaping at the bottom.It is 20 May 2022  Friday  9.45 am in Singapore and 9.45 pm in New York. Pika World wishes you a splendid weekend!,btohqsg
