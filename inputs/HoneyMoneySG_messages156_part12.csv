Any idea if the 10 mar amaze nerf applies by transaction date or posting date? If I spend today but only posted after 10 mar will incur the 1% fee?,btohqsg

Hi guys just wanted to share for those using chocolate finance---Below is from Audz channel:‚ÄúThe removal of Chocolate Visa Card as a payment option on AXS was made at the request ofChocolate Finance. We work closely with our partners and have honored their request to implement the change. AXS strives to offer as many payment options as possible and welcomes issuers who wish to use our platform to reach more users.‚Äù---Previously chocolate finance have updated their website to show:Can I use the Chocolate Visa debit card on AXS?AXS is no longer accepting the Chocolate Debit Card as a credit card payment mechanism. We are exploring with them to see if we can resolve.Nothing else about the Max Miles programme is affected. You can still earn 2 Max Miles for every S$1 spent on almost any other spend  anywhere-up to your first S$1 000 spend per month and 0.4 Max Miles per S$1 after that. Plus  enjoy free FX on overseas spending.---Now it's showing:Can I use the Chocolate Visa debit card on AXS?Chocolate Debit Card can no longer be used as a credit card payment mechanism on AXS.This does not affect any other part of the Max Miles programme. You will still earn 2 Max Miles for every S$l spent on nearly all other spend categories  up to your first S$1 000 per month  and 0.4 Max Miles per S$1 thereafter. Plus  you continue to enjoy free FX on overseas spending.We periodically review our spend categories to ensure balance and long-term sustainability of our rewards programme. At this time  AXS payments are paused  but we are evaluating whether to bring them back in the future.---What do yall think?,btohqsg
No need to think  just make the best of it.,btohqsg

This got me skeptical about chocolate finance a little.,btohqsg
"the classic ""your words against mine"" situation. between the 2  i trust AXS more. choc fin is a startup after all",btohqsg
Chocolate finance has been very weird. Been requesting for my chocolate card 3 times. The card never ever arrives. WhatsApp help didn‚Äôt provide a solution also. Just ask me to try again. Very very weird,btohqsg
use choc finance at ur own risk. I won‚Äôt personally trust a company for being dishonest,btohqsg
For the invest component in OCBC 360 account  can I use SRS to buy $20k of unit trust instead of cash?,btohqsg
