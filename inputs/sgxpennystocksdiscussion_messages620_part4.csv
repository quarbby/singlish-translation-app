💎Pika World Update 8 March 2022💎🎙Things turned sour🥊Equity markets dived on Monday  and the Dow is not in the correction territory. As oil prices continued to remain elevated after western countries signalled readiness on the possibility of banning Russian oil imports  the risk-off sentiments roll.It comes on Sunday night as the US and the European allies appeared to discuss such an idea. More news surfaced that Blinken is considering such a possibility  and Pelosi mentioned in one letter asking her congress colleagues to consider such legislation banning Russian oil.🪜Inflation and Commodity Prices🔭The fall in US stocks reflects the concern with inflation and  more importantly  economic growth gave the rapid rise of commodity prices. As a result  households will be the most hit to curtail their spending. Likewise  higher commodity prices may eat into their profit margin for companies. Hence  it will impact both households and businesses.Of course  oil isn't the only commodity that is of concern. Russia has other commodity production  so if sanction passes beyond oil  the inflation worry could be more widespread. We are already seeing a sharp tick up on the price of wheat  which has climbed by about 70% this year.🏀Fed needs to tread carefully🕹The Fed will have a difficult task to balance. While it intends to increase the interest rate to tame inflation  it will also slow economic growth. Hence  it tends to strike a delicate balance and possibly stick to its modest 0.25% rate hike instead of much higher expectation. Next week's FOMC meeting will shed light on this insight.Before that  we will have inflation data on Thursday. We expect the CPI index to rise 7.8% yearly for Feb  much higher than the previous 7.5% expectation.While political tension continued to brew  Putin is also approving the government to pay the creditors by his government and the country's companies in rubles to avoid the possibility of default.If there is no support to the S&P 500  we could see more uncertainty and downward pressure as analysts may lower their target for the year on major indices.It is 8 March  Tuesday  7.10  am in Singapore and 7.10 pm in New York.It has been a tough week to begin with  and Pika World wishes all friends safe trading and investing journey!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
He should be give up thinking western will help ba,btohqsg
US seem to alway threaten country... But now is Putin..really wrong move,btohqsg
I hope this will be the start of the unraveling of the US policies,btohqsg
Where NATO and EU members start to wonder why they got to listen to the US,btohqsg
Their leadership is replaced every election and polices are unstable vs China Russia etc,btohqsg
Politics is often just played for their own electorate.,btohqsg
US don't need Russia oil n gas. But Europe need,btohqsg
If not for US  maybe Europe relationship with Russia not so bad. US and UK main culprits,btohqsg
This whole mess could have been avoided. If they were not going to defend Ukraine why keep saying you won't commit to keeping Ukraine out of NATO? They basically used Ukraine as a punching bag to get at Russia,btohqsg
Symbolic only. Only 90k barrels a day of Russia oil import per mth.,btohqsg
US can go ahead to ban,btohqsg
dont think it can be avoided. no countries will want to make compromises,btohqsg
*Rex International Holding (REXI SP)*(BUY  TP: S$0.58  Last Price: S$0.480)*Explosive results  beating expectations* Both revenue and PATMI skyrocketed as averaged realized sold oil price increased from US$34 to US$67/bbl. FY21 revenue and PATMI was at US$158m (US$47m in 2020) and US$79m (-US$15.2m loss in 2020)  forming 106% and 150% of our full year forecasts. EBITDA increased from US$3m to US$110m in 2021. With oil prices past US$100/bbl  we expect REX to continue its outperformance in 2022.*Huge cash war chest*. Including liquid quoted investments  Rex now boasts a cash war chest of US$86m  up from US$46m in 2020. However  net cash position remains at US$39m after a US$47m bond issuance to fund the Brage Field acquisition.*Gross barrels attributable to license.* (Basically how much left)1P: 4.2m2P: 6.6m3P: 7.6m*Up to economic year 2027*1P (Proven) reserves for Oman is now at 2.7m  29% increase from the previous report. Meaning that production would be longer than expected.2P (proven + probable) and 3P (proven + probable + possible) dropped 26% and 46% as more clarity  production  and volumetrics are known abt the well.*Oman barrels per day*Barrels/days for Oman is currently at 7 518  slightly lower than Dec 21 due to maintenance works. We expect barrels/day to increase back to 9 000-10 000 once its completed.*Norway barrels/day*Net Barrels/days for Brage in Norway is currently at 2 496 barrels/day. Net estimates to Rex for the field is around 7.3m barrels*Maiden dividend*. The Board is recommending a final dividend of S$0.005 per ordinary share for the financial year ending 31 December 2021  payable in 4Q2022 pending approval.*Maintain BUY* with a higher SOTP-based target price of S$0.58 (S$0.46)  based on 1.0x 2022F RNAV.  We opine that Rex is an attractive pure-play on the ongoing oil super cycle. However  as total oil production is currently capped at 11 000-12 000bbls/day  any rise in revenue would mainly be caused by oil price increases and not volume production.Also  Rex is moving onto SGX’s mainboard as of 8th Mar 2022  allowing the company to reach out to more institutional investors moving forward.https://research.uobkayhian.com/content_download.jsp?id=66893&h=6fd1603ab2095dd25a27cb958bac6cfb,btohqsg
