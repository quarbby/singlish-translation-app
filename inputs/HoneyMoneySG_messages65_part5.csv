I'm trying to invest some of my children savings since they have the benefit of time. They're in primary school.I'm looking at Syfe Core Equities100 portfolio. Alternatively I'm thinking whether it's cheaper for me to buy 1 or 2 of the bigger ETFs within the Syfe portfolio in Webull and hold it in there?The reason why I'm quoting Syfe and Webull is because I use them currently for investing and trading respectively.My concern is purely on the long term costs of using Syfe Vs Webull.,btohqsg

Maybank F&F categories dosent include fashion stores is it? Or does retail include fashion stores?,btohqsg
look at the MCCs spelt out in the TNC.. safer..,btohqsg
They only listed a few like popular  kiddy palace  etc. so those not listed means no cashback?,btohqsg
yupbe careful ah.. those are NAME CHECK merchants.. do not tag on shopback or amaze or fave etc..,btohqsg
Nobody try this before. You can try to use Amaze + Maybank FnF on those retail stores that have mcc codes stated on the Online Fashion category TnC.Good luck to you. Let us know if you success.,btohqsg
Ask I ask other topic? Is possible to convert postpaid to prepaid from any service provider?,btohqsg
Anyone here bought the 2 years Singlife Secure Saver IV 4.15% (15 Aug) or Singlife Secure Saver III 4.10% (6 June)?Does your policy inception start date begins on the date payment received by Singlife or on the date that policy document is generated and ready for viewing?,btohqsg
Singlife tells me their inception  date begins on the date that policy document is generated but they took more than 12 days to process the application after receiving the full payment.It doesn't make sense to me  end up 12 days of lost interest. This can end up an interest loss of $682+ for 12 days if someone puts in $500k.,btohqsg
Your payout will also be 12 days later  no?,btohqsg
