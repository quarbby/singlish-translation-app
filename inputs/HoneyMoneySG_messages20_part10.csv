If you're saying SCB Simply Cash (Unlimited) then yes.,btohqsg
I recently opened an account but haven't deposited funds how about u?,btohqsg

SImilar  but you can just cash out the voucher immediately without next purchase,btohqsg
How can I check the MCC of the transactions? I can’t see any from statements,btohqsg
can only check with hsbc cso,btohqsg
Hello guysUob one account with salary alone what is the interest rate?,btohqsg
Think is 0.65% (same as spending 500 alone) based on my User interface.. (SAL done but transactions not posted yet),btohqsg
For instarem amaze  the 1% cash back would be in points right? So we would need to spend 2000 to get the 20bux? Am planning to use the card to pay for my hotel overseas( around 1000 sgd ) any other cards/tips would be welcomed,btohqsg
Just called uobNeed to have credit or debit card first+ Salary than have high interest rateSalary alone don't have high interest rate,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing too... Think if wanna do pure salary  just put in OCBC,btohqsg
Uob is marginally better  I did the math,btohqsg
I try use Amex pay at hawker,btohqsg
Cannot go through lol. Not sure why,btohqsg
Yes I agreeBut it credit card don't  meet my needsUsing uob amexNow looking at others,btohqsg

Anyone got problem applying the UOB one?,btohqsg
Does UOB Absolute to Grab  Grab to pay income tax via AXS still works ?,btohqsg
U mean slow in approve or sending u the cardBoth got same history or slow processing same as HSBC,btohqsg
When wanna click getmyinfo from singpass linkIt hanged there LoL,btohqsg

Hi all! If I got a high purchase to do  which are the best cc to use? Since HSBC REVO and Citi Rewards got caps,btohqsg
Shopping? Try looking at OCBC Titanium,btohqsg
Let say buy iPhone for 1.7k,btohqsg
DBS WWMC or OCBC Titanium should work for apple online stores,btohqsg
Can i tag uob absolute to simply go for public transportation?,btohqsg
I think SimplyGo don’t accept Amex,btohqsg
Can subscribe to sc smart for simplygo,btohqsg
Simply go purely SCB smart is best top of the tierUnless u got other spending other card like UOB one got bonus to %% on simply go besides the basic tier of 3.33,btohqsg
WWMC buy from KrisShop via Kris +,btohqsg
You won’t get more 4 mpd beyond 2K spend for air tickets w WWMCBeyond 2.7K … UOB SQKFCC 3 mpd beats the miles earning of DBS WWMC,btohqsg
Cuz they award miles for buying there on top of the credit card miles.,btohqsg
Hi all  just curious if anyone have any suggestion or idea how to lower property tax?,btohqsg
Hi all  may I check if there's any point in using amaze for simplygo after linking with Citi Rewards? Seems like transit related transactions are not eligible for the 10X,btohqsg
ohhh 2.7*3 ok got it i was wondering why specifically 2.7,btohqsg
I called UOB to ask about my CC application. They say average processing time is 2 weeks. FYI.  Till now not approved yet but haven’t 2 weeks lol,btohqsg
Much faster if you have existing card i think  i applied just three days ago  on Sunday  and yesterday it was approved.Now just waiting for the physical card!,btohqsg
I have 2 existing card leh,btohqsg
That's odd...did you try to login your ibanking and check if the card is showing in ur account yet?,btohqsg
Citi Rewards excludes air tickets from 4 mpd so I didn't mention them. As for WWMC any online purchase will do.,btohqsg
For air tickets below 2.7K  I'll get 8K miles from the 4K miles plus 0.4 mpd after $2 000,btohqsg
I never got a cc card ffom uob but mine was approved and send card within 1week+,btohqsg
Ya Try login to your uob app it will show the card if it approved,btohqsg
