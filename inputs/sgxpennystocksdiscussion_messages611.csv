üíéPika World Update 17 February 2022üíéüéô FOMC Minutesü™úHot out of the oven is the FOMC minutes that showed the Fed inclination towards quicker interest rate hikes to tame inflation. It includes other monetary tightening policies too. It is almost certain that the Fed will increase the interest rate during the March FOMC.One key relief is that most officials believed that inflation would continue to moderate over the year. Still  more aggressive action is to achieve a stable price policy in the short term.üí∏Faster rate increase compared to the past‚åõÔ∏èInterestingly  the minutes compared to the situation in 2015 and the forecast is that a faster pace than those in post 2015-period is warranted if the economy continued to be on track for robust growth or if the inflation continued to stay elevated.However  the minute does not hint at any mention of the possible 0.5% rate hike.üé¢Bond Purchase Operation & Balance Sheet‚öñÔ∏èUnsurprisingly  the bond purchase will end probably around 10 March 2022  as most participants believed that sticking to their pre-announced plan is more applicable than an early cessation of the plan that could speak the market.There were also principles laid out that act as guiding torches for shrinking the $9 trillion balance sheet. The vast amount of the securities holdings is expected to wind down substantially. Yet  the minutes do not show the schedule for such an operation  and it might be seen as a slight dovish stance.In a nutshell  the FOMC minutes were probably less hawkish than market participants feared  and the equity market remained stable upon the release of the minutes.It is 17 February  Thursday  7.00  am in Singapore and 7.00 pm in New York.We have a relatively calm week  and Pika World wishes everyone a profitable trading week ahead!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

The euro was weighed down on Thursday after a U.S. official said Russia was increasing troop numbers near its border with Ukraine rather than withdrawing  offsetting a boost it had caught overnight from a modest retreat in U.S. rate hike expectations.The standoff on Europe's eastern edge is one of the deepest crises in East-West relations for decades  and markets - and the euro - had rallied in relief at earlier Russian statements about a military pullback. A senior U.S. official told reporters on Wednesday that those statements were false.,btohqsg

"Investing.com- The U.S. dollar bounced in early European trade Thursday  with this safe haven boosted by reports of hostilities in eastern Ukraine  raising fears of a major conflict.At 2:55 AM ET (07:55 GMT)  the Dollar Index  which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies  traded 0.2% higher at 95.900.Russian-backed rebels earlier Thursday accused Ukrainian government forces of shelling their territory in the eastern part of the country. This has created a lot of uncertainty over whether this will remain a localized event or if it could lead to a broader conflict with Russia using the event as a reason to invade.Tensions had been reduced earlier in the week after Russia announced it was withdrawing some of its troops positioned near Ukraine  but a number of Western countries  including the U.S.  and NATO have disputed that claim.We have seen ""no meaningful pullback"" of Russian forces from the border with Ukraine  U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday  while being interviewed on television. ""On the contrary  we continue to see forces  especially forces that would be in the vanguard of any renewed aggression against Ukraine  continuing to be at the border  to mass at the border.""https://www.investing.com/news/forex-news/dollar-edges-higher-as-ukraine-tensions-rise-fed-minutes-relatively-dovish-2766021",btohqsg

üíéPika World Update 18 February 2022üíéüß®Renewed Fearsü•äEquity markets were sharply lowered after numerous conflicting reports on whether Russia increased troops on the Ukraine border. This led to significant indices falling sharply. Losses accumulated larger after Bullard sparked hawkish comments. Such dual stresses on the market meant a risk-off sentiment.üí∏Fastly: The fallen name‚õèThe content-delivery network provided a weak 2022 guidance  and some analysts felt it was too conservative. This sent the stock to dive sharply. The target price for the company was also revised lower to as low as $20.Analysts are now looking at is company's analyst day in May for more clarity on the growth path as long-term goals appear to be milky. The new management team is expected to help solve the margin compression issue as Fastly worked on the ground to execute its next-generation architecture and invest substantially in growth possibly.Pika World will be on the sideline and looks to accumulate a tiny position.‚è∞Roku: The tumble continues‚õΩÔ∏èFourth-quarter revenue fell short of expectation as the company warned about supply chain disruptions. However  active accounts were robust as they increased 17% yearly to hit 60.1 million. The average revenue per user also saw decent growth of 43% to reach $41.03.It was a problematic earning release as the stock swung sharply as its website was down after issuing a press release on the site. The stock has been down around 68% for the past 12 months  along with popular likes of Peloton Interactive.As lockdown eases  stay-at-home demand appears to wane  and Roku is also the victim of such a trend. The company sees supply chain disruption impact running into 2022  which will affect the consumer electronics space. Likewise  TV unit sales are likely to remain muted and thus affect their active account growth.Pika World will be on the sideline.It is 18 February  Friday  7.00  am in Singapore and 7.00 pm in New York.It has been a tough week  and Pika World wishes all friends a restful weekend ahead!Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

Singapore Medical Group (SMG) is one the most established group of medical/specialist set up.This one starting to come awake after being in limbo and in a tight range $0.295 to $0.320.Good thing to note and why this could be an excellent longer term investment- Aging population in Singapore üá∏üá¨ and in the region- Singapore have always been know for medical tourism and SMG have positioned themselves as one who welcomes the international clients- BVPS at $0.328- Gearing at a mere 4.58%- Price action coming towards the results very decisive and strong üí™üèº You can sense that strong hands have been collecting this one- Borders and laxing of travel restrictions as nations start opening up their economies will lead to rise in international medical tourism for Singapore which will in turn aid SMG top and bottom line.- results coming out soon and the PA toward this looks really super- last time when they almost made a deal to sell to another party  price rallied from $0.265 to $0.425 in a few months. With Singapore being resilient to Covid as shown  we can do expect there would certainly be big investors interested in this group. Hence  a possible buy over in the cards.Price Target üéØ- short term to test $0.335- mid to longer term $0.385-$0.405DYODD. OTOT if in the money. Market can change anytime and we have to react always.Good luck holder.PS: who wouldn‚Äôt want to own a piece of a company that have over 30 clinics/specialist clinics since we know this is a sure win business and definitely profitable long run?,btohqsg

Updates on SMG (weekly)Since we started covering and calling buy $0.305 for SingMedical last 2 weeks back. It have steadily risen.It is evident that some one have been accumulating this one based on the PA.Also  SMG fell fast enough after the interested persons initial deal didn‚Äôt go through. Once they breech 335 clear  might have a nice candle there since there is not much resistance in 330 to 375.This one ‚òùÔ∏è is one to put in the watchlist.IMO  this one‚Äôs a sure winner for longer term HODLersDYODD still,btohqsg
