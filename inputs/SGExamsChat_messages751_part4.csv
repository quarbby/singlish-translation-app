"It's been 2 minutes without sgexams  I canâ€™t stop shaking and Iâ€™m having severe mental breakdowns. I woke up today trying to sgexams discord but my mom already took away my ipad  I had a major panic attack but managed to calm down after a few seconds. I couldnâ€™t go to school today  I am nothing without sgexams  it is my life  it is my destiny  without sgexams  I wouldn't be able to do anything. sgexams is the best thing ever made and I can't get rid of my addiction to it  it is the best game in existence. I can't stop trembling and crying  I am very worried. I used all of my time on sgexams  I got #1 rank on weekly and talk there more than i talk to my family. I don't know what to do. sgexams can't be gone any longer cause if it does then I'll go insane again.. breaking my mouse  chair  house  and everything I own. sgexams is very amazing and I can't lose it. sgexams is my life  I met my amazing girlfriend john there  while i was keeisao-ing there when I met this girl i immediately blushed. I pmed her later then and tried to talk to her  she was so kind and cute that I accidentally typed my thoughts out ""mind: she's so cute.."" and she flushed than I got nervous  after that  we went on many dates to Catholic jc  where we adopted 2 boys named bedok  and tatabusa. bedok and tatabusa were so cute that I even took them out of town and took them to sgteens. after that we had our child in Staircase 6 on our rooftop named teddysee. Our kids were so cute and amazing. and the day after... my mom told me no more sgexams and I went through my panic attack  Shivering in fear of losing my fiance and kids. I am so scared that I might just lose my mind and go insane... I want my kids back...",btohqsg

"Boy oh boy where do I even begin. Lebron..honey  my pookie bear. I have loved youever since I first laid eyes on you. The wayyou drive into the paint and strike fearinto your enemies eyes. Your silky smoothtouch around the rim  and that gorgeousjumpshot. I would do anything for you. Iwish it were possible to freeze time so Iwould never have to watch you retire.You had a rough childhood  but you never gave up hope. You are even amazing off the court  you're a great husband and father  sometimes I even call you dad. I forvever dread and weep  thinking of the day you will one day retire. I would sacrifice my ownlife it were the only thing that could puta smile on your beautiful face.You have given me so much joy  and heartbreak over the years. I remember when you first left clevenland and its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell frommy right eye when I watched you win yourfirst ring in miami  because deep down my glorious king deserved it. I just wanted you to return home. Then allas  you did  my sweet baby boy came home and I rejoiced.2015 was a hard year for us baby  but in2016 you made history happen. You cameback from 3-1 and I couldn't believe it.I was crying  bawling even  and I heard myglorious king exclaim these words ""CLEVELAND  THIS IS FOR YOU!"" Not onlyhave you changed the game of basketballand the world forever  but you've eternallychanged my world. And now you're gettingolder  but still the goat  my goat. I loveyou pookie bear  my glorious king  LebronJames.",btohqsg
