for me all giro payments will deduct from UOB one except for taxes deduct from HSBC EGA. so for OCBC 360 there's not much money moments except for salary and interest. so not that difficult to keep track of the daily balances and they can be precomputed.,btohqsg
just need to remember to topup 500 on day 1 to up the daily average balance. then on interest and payday remember to withdraw all on same day if already hit 100k,btohqsg
does anyone knows if GIRO deducts based on credit card monthly bill or remaining balance? Let's say my cc bill is $100 and I have GIRO set up. If I manually pay $10 to the card  will the GIRO deduct $90 or $100?,btohqsg
$90 if u manual pay way in advance,btohqsg
I also wanted to change my giro to EGA however seems like for IRAS it doesn‚Äôt support EGIRO  which means I need to manually fill up GIRO form to change from UOB to HSBC?,btohqsg
I believe this is what I didn‚Äôt do it correctly  I only missed a day didn‚Äôt transfer out my credited salary. So this month I didn‚Äôt get my save bonus :(,btohqsg
Hi can i check for UOB one account  i need to spend $500 on my UOB one card first before i can see my ‚Äúsalary credit‚Äù indicator fulfilled?,btohqsg
Yes it has to be manul. Mail it to IRAS by filling it up. Not email but post. But to mail it to IRAS no postage is needed. To address needs to be on the front side and return on back side. If you write both address on front it might be sent back to u. Learnt the hard way,btohqsg
I think its not sequence based. During weekends its updated late. If u see the screenshot it say as of 13 may. I.e not updated for today. Ots a little late but as long as criteria is met within the month it just works,btohqsg
Does anyone have a cashback credit card recommendation for public transport and hawker centre usage??,btohqsg
Hahaha i was considering it but i'm thinking about the $500 minimum spend monthly,btohqsg
I typically recommend getting the 2 free supplementary cards so more humans can help to hit the minimum spending.,btohqsg
Hi expert ! I am new to the credit card game and i am considering to register for UOB One account with the EVOL card and i had some questions :-Does paying through paynow is like paying with your credit card if they are linked ? Does it count for the 500$ min spend ?-Does paying through paynow count for mobile contactless/Online/Other spend with card ? Or none of those ?-Just want to confirm the definition of online spend : everything that is paid online meaning in the apps like lazada  grab and on internet liketrip.com  amazon ?-Definition of mobile contactless : with apple pay  Google pay  samsung pay where the card is linked ?-Definition of all other spend : everything else ? Does it include pay now ?Thank you so much !,btohqsg
paynow is paying from savings account  not credit card.Apps or website are both usually online  unless processed offlinemobile contactless is using the card via google/samsung/apple pay and tap the phone,btohqsg
no need be too concern what is other spend cos it is only 0.3%. But if use physical card or at uob$ merchant is under others.,btohqsg
Thank you so much for the clarification ! Are all the card terminal where you can usually pay with paywave can be paid with apple samsung google pay ? Or it needs a specific terminal ?,btohqsg

For ocbc the min spend is by statement month or calendar month?,btohqsg
I thought is calendar month ? No ah ?,btohqsg
Calendar. Make sure the transaction posted (and not Pending) by the end of calendar month tho,btohqsg
posted by end of calendar month,btohqsg
for dbs and another bank I think can egiro. but for HSBC you need to download the form  print  fill up and mail.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if there is a fee to use duitnow in Malaysia? And what are the exchange rates like?,btohqsg

Hi all CPF gurus  i want to ask what benefit does topping up VCMA provides to reach BHS yearly on 1 jan. I have watched majority of chris and kelvin's video before arriving at this question.E g. bob has to top up 2.5k cash to reach this year's BHS limit of $68 500 from the previous year's $66 000. Bob is earning $6000 monthly  so 480 into MA monthly.Scenario 1:bob paid $2500 to max out BHS at the start of the year  meaning $480*12 = $5760 is supercharged into his SA.Net gains: $5760 - $2500 = $3260Scenario 2:Bob does not top up at the start of the year but instead allows monthly CPF contributions to max out his BHS.Time taken to max out: $2500 / $480 monthly = 5.2 months. After 5.2 months  subsequent MA amount for the year is supercharged into his SA (12-5.2)*$480= $3264.Net gains: $3264I understand that the $2500 is eligible for tax relief  but at 2.5k tax relief it does not seem significant (<$400 tax payable max at $200k annual income) compared to an expense of $2500 (1 to 4k yearly  depending of increment). Both scenario 1 and 2 provides the same gains in SA overall. The 2.5k could have placed in let's say UOB One or OCBC 360.What are your thoughts?,btohqsg
Hey guys  just to confirm.. Are there sign up promos forexistingdbs credit card users for DBS Altitude Visa and DBS Woman World Mastercard?,btohqsg
Hello!! Im looking for a credit card and never own one before. What are some recommendations for a starter?I have read about the SC smart credit but felt that it was lacking  prefer something I can use day to day  will prefer cash back instead of the rewards system too. I prolly spend less than 1000 per month on transactions.,btohqsg
https://www.sc.com/sg/credit-cards/simply-cash-credit-card/If your spending cannot meet $600 consistent  what about this? Zero admin for changing points to cashback or vouchers. Zero min spend.You can check out the many videos  Chris has produced for the community here.,btohqsg
No la probably not so low haha prolly between 800-1200. But thanks will take a look at that!,btohqsg
Just wanna ask - does crmc give rewards for education? If not  which Mastercard does? If not which Visa card does?,btohqsg
Oh $800-1200. U got couple of good  choices :). Consider your usage case before signing up :),btohqsg
If you intend to have ADB more than $500 compare to previous month  my suggestion is don‚Äôt use that account as your main account. Credit $510 on the account every month. Use other bank account for your day to day withdrawal. Then this will save your hassle to keep track ADB.,btohqsg
Need to use Citi Payall. 2.2% admin charge. Use Cardup better ba,btohqsg
But payall got promo now  2.2mpd,btohqsg
if you spend significant amount on food  OCBC 365 pair with the OCBC 360 savings account,btohqsg
easy to clock that in payall,btohqsg
Hi! If my salary is being credited to OCBC360  i transfer a sum out to another account for expenses and keep $500 in the account every month  that means my ADB increases by $500 each month?,btohqsg
I rather use TNG e wallet  registered Duitnow and Topup via Trust credit / debit card with low fx spread and no dcc charges.,btohqsg
Will be traveling overseas in June and main ticket items yet to pay are Car Rental and Hotel Room Charges. What will be the best standalone or combi cards to use to max out earning miles. Currently holding HSBC Revol  DBS Woman's  OCBC Titanium Rewards & Amaze cards. Many thanks in advance üòä,btohqsg
it is by statement month  but u can call uob to change credit card statement to match calendar month,btohqsg
Yeah I usually do that as well. I'm just curious as to what's the difference in fee (if any) and fx rate if I were to use my local paynow directly to pay duitnow in Malaysia,btohqsg
For Ocbc 360  it is an *increase* of ADB $500 compare to previous month. If your ADB last month is $2000  your ADB this month must be at least more than $2500.The whole idea is to have less transactions in and out in your accounts for you to calculate ADB.,btohqsg
What are the choices u recco for this spendage?,btohqsg
In the first year  assuming $200k bracket with 19% tax rate  your $2.5k gives you 23% compared to 5% with UOB one. You might say that your 2.5k is locked up  then it depends on whether you see yourself consistently being able to outperform cpf 4%  or maybe just treat it as fulfilling the low risk portion of your long term retirement plan.But when your income tax bracket gets that high  trust me it hurts.,btohqsg
U should do the $500 on 1st of every month,btohqsg
Oh so it isn't about just increase the balance sum?  Eg. April: $3K  May: $3.5K  Jun: $4K,btohqsg
