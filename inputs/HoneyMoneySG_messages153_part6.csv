"Hi all  looking to invest my SRS funds into either 1) Endowus Blackrock iShares US Index Fund (IE) S&P500 or 2) POEMS Amundi Prime USA Fund. Understand the fees are 0.08% (fund) + 0.3% (platform) = 0.38% for iShares and 0.05% (fund) + 0.4% (30% dividend witholding tax on ~1.3% yield) = 0.45%.iShares seems cheaper in terms of fees compared to Amundi...However  I'm thinking iShares only has capital appreciation  whereas Amundi has ""same"" capital appreciation + dividends... would this not add to the total returns of Amundi?If so  which is better?",btohqsg
I thought poems has 0.03% annual management fee as well,btohqsg
