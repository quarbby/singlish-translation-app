But that was 3 years ago,btohqsg
If that's the case we are from the same batch man,btohqsg

6.3 and above not so much,btohqsg
That time I even heard they started learning sec sch stuff,btohqsg
they don't mention the retainers fr,btohqsg
"""Ultimately if u wan go uni   btr to go jc""",btohqsg
Those I've talked to in poly told me that,btohqsg
I mean they also have JC friends ah,btohqsg
They didn't advise with that kind of mindset,btohqsg
Also those who said that didn't have a course they're really passionate abt + no directn lol,btohqsg
"""Unless u have a v particularly course ur int in  JC's the *more preferred/btr option*  """,btohqsg
Oh so be it bottom or top,btohqsg
Then what makes the diff is the portfolio,btohqsg
Do I have less of an advantage since I clb,btohqsg
It's not counted as an official h1,btohqsg
they might adjust the difficulty along with it,btohqsg
Cause like let's say  me and another person  got same score same grade everything  portfolio also,btohqsg
Idk man like got risk factor,btohqsg
pray i somehow squeeze in during those years,btohqsg
cannot be that far wat  otherwise wld leak out easier,btohqsg
Just nice when the new As system takes place,btohqsg
I kinda feel bad for those who retain,btohqsg
i tot this yr alrdy pw pass/fail?,btohqsg
I wonder if the admission criteria is deadass strict asf,btohqsg
they did say that the 4th would only count if it improves the candidate's RP,btohqsg
so we still gon have 90rp,btohqsg
when did the holy grail change to anime waifu lmao,btohqsg
For the new system in later years,btohqsg
I never understood what is the aim of the 70RP system,btohqsg
if you read the news  they did say 4th sub is only counted if it improves your RP,btohqsg
Doesn't it just make everything more stressful,btohqsg
So you can get 70 still,btohqsg
so if you can go from 70/70 to 90/90  sure but if like 70/70 to 79/90 then nah,btohqsg
So short term less stress long term more stress,btohqsg
Iirc students complain PW take too much of time or smth,btohqsg
i guess it will be more similar to the uk a level scoring system,btohqsg
I spent my whole J1 doing PW,btohqsg
And threw my content subjects down the drain,btohqsg
They want students to focus on academics or smth,btohqsg
PW isn't even inherently stressful tbf,btohqsg
Like so called take off that load,btohqsg
The stress comes from working with people,btohqsg
Ya so it's a people issue,btohqsg
For PW  every part counts right,btohqsg
