i believe there have been even worse topics other than this kinda subjective question here,btohqsg
i just mean the answers you get here probs won't really say much,btohqsg
Then there are some ppl who actually cant tolerate it,btohqsg
like not about the question itself  just the answers you'll get lor,btohqsg
I NEED ANSWERS FOR THIS TOO,btohqsg
im not really looking for right or wrong kinda answers,btohqsg
or their stance on this topic,btohqsg
I think everyone sees it differently,btohqsg
i hate couples (i want to be held),btohqsg
Like some ppl even use them interchangeably…,btohqsg
i personally don't bother thinking about a distinction at all,btohqsg
i hope you can find a s/o without getting hurt,btohqsg
it doesn't have to be that complicated,btohqsg
I actually rarely use those words lmao,btohqsg
Coz i am not an express feeling sort of person,btohqsg
like right at the start i like this person  and if it lasts eventually i'll say i love them,btohqsg
if no one dates me by this year im gonna start league of legends,btohqsg
but when does it transition from one to another? idc,btohqsg
might as well sign on NS,btohqsg
Walao parents force me do cs master   argument damn rabak.,btohqsg
i once read an article saying bto is more than emotions then i thought how it's like liking a person is easy but loving them is harder than it seems,btohqsg
Yeah because they just came from dinner,btohqsg
BTO is more than emotions ?!,btohqsg
ok true BTO is essentially marriage,btohqsg
i can tell the biting sarcasm from this,btohqsg
bc liking/loving is emotional but there's other considerations like whether lifestyles etc fit. you dk how living with each other long term will be like,btohqsg
bto is essentially engagement in sg,btohqsg
and it's always advisable to have a thorough discussion before marriage stuff is even brought up,btohqsg
Convo can happen any time of the day,btohqsg
Liking results in you not remembering it until you want toLoving results in you constant remembering it even when you don’t want to,btohqsg
are you the one that dream job is consulting,btohqsg
damn thats deep just theorising about it,btohqsg
i think a distinction like that doesn't really do anything,btohqsg
some people don't feel that way specifically,btohqsg
doesn't mean it's any less valid,btohqsg
you can prove to your parents with actions?,btohqsg
Liking also means you dont specifically do things to allign with that thing you like. (So be it  if others have it)Loving it means you will subconsciously or purposely allign your actions to head towards the thing you love (you won’t be so carefree for things you love),btohqsg
I mean you won’t skip a work meeting for a friend you like  you would for a friend you love,btohqsg
You would cause you have too much free time,btohqsg
i have too much free time?,btohqsg
Work is work how is meeting a friend an excuse,btohqsg
on why we'd skip a work ( meeting ),btohqsg
its a example i thought up lol..prob cause my work meetings are redundant to me and my colleagues,btohqsg
i think it works for both friends and lover wise tbh,btohqsg
but depending on situation and context,btohqsg
"literally we would agree to ask the ""project head""..but then you have people discussing the same issue..for 1hr more with the result of ""agreeing to ask the project head""",btohqsg
Well but the underlying reason fueling such desire differs,btohqsg
the amt of bs in work meetings is unreal,btohqsg
people also prioritise friends  work  partner  etc differently,btohqsg
I mean strictly. Alover would have a different set of convictions and priorities compared to a friend.,btohqsg
