"it's more like""here are some sets andhere are some relationships we have among those sets!""",btohqsg
Wait  what exactly is the problem with the definition in the pic?,btohqsg
There's no problem  it's just that I don't see where + comes from,btohqsg
I mean that‚Äôs the whole point of the definition isn‚Äôt it,btohqsg
To give meaning to the +,btohqsg
"Don't you find it handwavy with the ""Now suppose inductively ...?""",btohqsg
This is the fabled ‚ÄúI can understand the individual words but have no idea what is being said‚Äù,btohqsg
I am reading the book now,btohqsg
Its supposed to be a recursive definition though,btohqsg
Tao is saying this1.There exists a left additive identity (he defines the right one later)2. s(a)+b=s(a+b)(or if you'd like  a++),btohqsg
And those are the basic axioms he's starting from,btohqsg
Interestingly he repeatedly uses lots of induction,btohqsg
You know this is truly a mathematician's book,btohqsg
My first batch came out horrid,btohqsg
Regret buying all the ingredients now,btohqsg
Damn if only this grp had biologists and not mathematicians,btohqsg
Medicine  so human biology I guess?,btohqsg
Im just a peasant who spent sometime studying evo-bio,btohqsg
Aka gender studies of the bio fields,btohqsg
I know some evo-bio but gender studies???üòÇ,btohqsg
You mean  genetic and physiological differences in sex?,btohqsg
Hahhaa one of the three schools.,btohqsg
No i am actually belittling the entire field of evo bio by comparing it to a worthless course of gender studies,btohqsg
Evolution can tell us quite abit though.  Like why do we have so few p53 copies,btohqsg
Or why elephants have so many,btohqsg
There used to be a copper based,btohqsg
Oh really... so similar porhyrin ring? But copper?,btohqsg
They didnt have a p ring tho,btohqsg
It was just a hexamaric structure with repeating motiff,btohqsg
So convergent evolution? Many species getting similar Hb in the end,btohqsg
Ps not an expert in this hahaha,btohqsg
Myoglobin affinity to o2 being higher etc,btohqsg
Surprisingly haemocyanins also have cooperative binding but that one i also not sure why,btohqsg
Or weather the precursors had it,btohqsg
But ik haemoglobin evolved a couple of times so possible modern haemocyanins just diverged from one of em,btohqsg
In which species do we still have copper being used as prosthetic group,btohqsg
They have similar dynamics? Like shifts with increased  paco2  erythropoeitin etc,btohqsg
I have no idea HAHAH i didnt study the details,btohqsg
Hahaha  I think the key to finetuning the human condition lies in studying other species,btohqsg
We have evolved to finetune our enviornment not ourselves. Just creating more weird selection pressures,btohqsg
Once and if we understand telomeres  inflammation  cancer and protooncogenes  etc etc...,btohqsg
Thats a very niche section to finetune,btohqsg
Plus the rate of change of selection pressure is far greater than increase in understanding,btohqsg
Hyperlipidemia etc.  Once humans live longer  maybe our research can be more fruitful as talented scientists wont die so early,btohqsg
You see uh.. half of these problems are as a result of rapidly changing selection pressures,btohqsg
It's interesting that SARS and covid is just 17 years apart.  As the polar ice caps melt we might see many strange viruses,btohqsg
Its actually alarming its only 17 years apart,btohqsg
It took 3 months for three strains to emerge from covid,btohqsg
Actually there are like at least 30 mutations most of which are silent mutations I think,btohqsg
But I guess 3 major strains,btohqsg
