I canâ€™t win most cars off the line anyways  pathetic FWD things.,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ I havenâ€™t opened dragy in like 9 months. Need to dust that thing off,btohqsg
Even if the ice can beat the ev on paper. Ev is so consistent  ice needs a perfect launch to beat it,btohqsg
Its pointless to record ev on dragy i think. Unless testing aerodynamics or certain modes,btohqsg
they should have their own leaderboard on dragy,btohqsg
even the local leaderboard should have electric part hahahaha,btohqsg
Sorry I know I can run errands while charging... Can share how long it will take to charge from low batt to 100%,btohqsg
Unless u said a drag race 1/4 mile   in Singapore road is all about 1/8 mile that ev dominate,btohqsg
U wonâ€™t have 1/4 mile to hit more then 200 km,btohqsg
But it is irrelevant as too much power already,btohqsg
To me ev beauty is all about 1 pedal drive,btohqsg
Recently I drive an ice   having to step on the brake is just so troublesome and tiring,btohqsg
hearing EV owners wax lyrical about EVs is tiring ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
power decreases as charge level decreases,btohqsg
meh i think its a good daily,btohqsg
wld get a polestar if there wasnt a 30% premium,btohqsg
the first word of your  statement is my sentiment,btohqsg
For the Singaporean context a small city ev is good to daily drive but don't claim you're saving the planet,btohqsg
lol if u use any type of transportation  its not environmentally friendly,btohqsg
This is like less then 1%,btohqsg
My car so far never go below 3%,btohqsg
when you launch continously 100 times  it has been proven to lose power,btohqsg
I launch a lot never lose powerr,btohqsg
i'm gonna  go  take a nap wake me up when the EV talk is over,btohqsg
or wake me up to tell me i've been selected for the CG/SGCM event,btohqsg
#SAVEYOURTEARSfor the EV users when they realize emissions on battery production and disposal and where their electricity comes from,btohqsg
I buy ev not to save the planet   is see the goverment rebate and no dealer margin so go and test drive,btohqsg
No good  later vegans come and scream that you're eating food sourced unethically,btohqsg
Because of the heat  many Tesla owners have said it's hard to sustain on track for more than 2-3 laps,btohqsg
I daily drive daily launch no issue,btohqsg
Does sg heat affect battery life of a Tesla,btohqsg
Like the 1 pedal driving   some love it some hate it,btohqsg
Usually is cold that will affect   heat is like u go track,btohqsg
Overtaking those car when I signal they accelerate,btohqsg
mr dave u launch 3 seconds i call tp liao,btohqsg
If you're driving in a very spirited way,btohqsg
Can overheat and result in drain,btohqsg
But other than that SG temperature is a good range for them,btohqsg
How long does it take to fully charge and can elaborate on the 1 pedal driving? I haven't sat in one/drive an EV...,btohqsg
Right if you keep doing pulls,btohqsg
Which a lot of Tesla drivers and blue SG drivers do sadly,btohqsg
If you want to brake you press the pedal again,btohqsg
Will detect you want to brake,btohqsg
Enough to over take lioa 1 second can be 8 car length,btohqsg
02.5 second is 4 car length,btohqsg
Means u donâ€™t need to use the brake   once u release the acceleration pressure the car will brake gradually Depent on your pressure   if you totallyRelease the acceleration  the car will brake like you step on the brake . So basically the acceleration and braking should be very smooth   if you use 1 pedal driving,btohqsg
Brake is only use when you need emergency braking or agressive driving,btohqsg
That is call exhibition of speed that Singapore donâ€™t have   but I keep within speed limit as enoigh to over take liao   floor from complete stop half a second is like 50 km already and u can change the lane easily,btohqsg
hahaha... I seriously thought that there isn't any brake pedal! so we are talking abt regen braking. this is interesting,btohqsg
There is a brake pedal as required based on regulations,btohqsg
