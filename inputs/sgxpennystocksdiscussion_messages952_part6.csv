Part 1 of 2Mencast having little or no volume going into the HY results. (Note: Based on the last several years  the results usually comes out 8th to 14th Aug)Event Timeline :- The spill was sparked by Netherlands-flagged dredger Vox Maxima hitting Singapore-flagged bunker vessel Marine Honour at Pasir Panjang Terminal at about 2.20pm on Friday. This happened on the 14th June 24.- Mencast featured in Straits Time where a picture taken on the 21st June 24 showed that showing a bag of treated sand in their treatment facility.DYODDSource:https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/oil-spill-sentosa-pasir-panjang-cleanup-wildlife-400-tonnes-4418371,btohqsg
Part 2 of 2Hence  we can assume the job was given out in short notice to mencast due to urgency. Also  i believe most businesses also charge a premium when doing urgent jobs? (Also  the entire exercise likely to be claimable by insurance?) Therefore  this unfortunate incident likely to have benefited mencast  financially wise IMO.The question here is whether a part of this mencast project will fall under the upcoming HY? (Up til 30th June 24) It is probable that downpayment/progressive claims would have been requested and if so  reflect in the upcoming results. Therefore  this one could be a good results bet.
