"Check out ""TimeTree - Shared Calendar""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=works.jubilee.timetree",btohqsg
Not sure if this is helpful to you anot..,btohqsg
Hmm play ard with it..as I also 1st time using this app..Hope it's helpful,btohqsg
Same concept as excel but with better UIBut main issue is that the consumers needs to download this app also leh,btohqsg
I‚Äôll try to play with the features also and see how beneficial it is  thanks for sharing! üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª,btohqsg
Most simplified de is Google calendar..only need our email address which I don't anyone has issue giving it to you so we can all add into it..Alternative will be this add or excel le,btohqsg
Another thing is idw them to edit the schedule / excel (prevent anybody from suka suka reserving/removingslots)So given this calendar / excel  they will only be allowed to seewho‚Äôs going on which day and I don‚Äôt find this meaningful for both the consumers nor the business leh hmmLet me think,btohqsg
You can control it as admin..Any changes they have to let you know..consumer can only see the slot avaiable,btohqsg
