Itâ€™s true la. Coming from one who drives continentals for more than ten years saying good things about Mazda must be credible,btohqsg
I ainâ€™t biased. Mazda definitely is better than Toyota.,btohqsg
I know  Iâ€™m in cx8 group  and a lot of the drivers are ex continental car owners,btohqsg
Cool. Itâ€™s no wonder why itâ€™s called the Japanese bmw  with higher reliability.,btohqsg
Their pricing is lower and make it more vfm for the features it has over others,btohqsg
Yes. Solid product. The start stop is miles better than bmw start stop,btohqsg
And it comes with signal lights,btohqsg
I love my Mazda. I donâ€™t love my bmws so much.,btohqsg
To many  owning a continental is a status,btohqsg
But car is a depreciating assetâ€¦,btohqsg
So pick the most vfm that ur wallet can stomach,btohqsg
Best is buy those cars donâ€™t require even to loan   to excerise fianance prudent to save for rainy days,btohqsg
whats the range of blueSG btw? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
The very reason why I buy an old ar.,btohqsg
I advised a friend to buy a used car. Then he replied to me why buy old cars when there are issues. I just laughed. Shows he is ignorant. He thinks people sell cars because there are problems.,btohqsg
They are like me   donâ€™t know how to handle old cars,btohqsg
I told him I buy food used cars. Let the suckers who buy new cars lose the most first.,btohqsg
Just want a worry free drive,btohqsg
People who have no experience buying used cars,btohqsg
That why I love tesla hehe,btohqsg
After losing a lot of money buying new cars I learned to be savvy and no more new cars. The first used car is the e30 and Iâ€™m still using it today,btohqsg
Yup like you can get a 740 at 22 k depreciation for a 6 years old car,btohqsg
But u need to know how to take care,btohqsg
This is a bit naive. A good used car is like a new one. Like my current Mazda. As good as new. But at significant discount,btohqsg
It not naive is cause u are good with cars   not every 1 is like toy,btohqsg
U need knowledge and connection to buy good 2nd hand car,btohqsg
Is true. For every good second hand deal  there are many cases of first time car buyer who got scam or bought a second hand car that gives them more problem,btohqsg
I bought a second hand merc  4 years old n the engine died on me 5 months later. Luckily I got 6 months engine warranty from car dealer if not the repair cost is 9k,btohqsg
Yes u need a trusted work shop   car knowledge and a trusted 2nd hand car dealer,btohqsg
Now I only buy new or 1 year old car with agent warranty. Iâ€™m the sucker for the rest. Haha.,btohqsg
Not really. I decided to buy a used car because Iâ€™m fed up losing so much buying new. I figure that I buy a good used car is good enough. Then I learned along the way,btohqsg
My first purchase of a used car is the very old BMW e30. Bold step,btohqsg
And That is the first BMW I own,btohqsg
Itâ€™s called taking the plunge. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Ya. I agree with u. I wish I am more knowledgeable with car. So either I get newer car or pay more to get car from trusted dealers. My current Audi A3 was a second hand car with agent warranty.,btohqsg
I also donâ€™t dare to buy old carâ€¦ cuz inexperienced in tt. And I prefer new car smell,btohqsg
But I will buy showroom car or demo car. Get some discount off  and still getting full 10 yrs coe. And warranty,btohqsg
No right or wrong. Cause is individual money. We all have different priorities. Haha,btohqsg
Yes i totally understand this   buy a lemon car is sleep sofa daily   kids and wife will killYou,btohqsg
actually if you can just get rid of the A3 once your warranty is up,btohqsg
Better and most optimal when your depre is relatively flat,btohqsg
every month my car always have small stuff keeps breaking LOL,btohqsg
My car is priceless now. WIll keep and see how she will witness the EV revolution,btohqsg
Yup. Thatâ€™s what I am intending to do. Warranty is 5 years. Still have 2 more years. Will change car before it ends,btohqsg
Some time repair cost more then change car,btohqsg
Somehow I start to think new cars wont last longer than 10 years at this rate.,btohqsg
I learn it the hard way,btohqsg
Depent what car and how much is the overhaul   some time u change car is cheaper haha,btohqsg
New cars alot of of electronics failure,btohqsg
Last time I got a car radiators down repair need 6 k and other problem workshop tell me change car to save money,btohqsg
