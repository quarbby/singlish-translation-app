but i mostly did external stuff,btohqsg
the school stuff... v dry hor,btohqsg
yep same  but i hated econs,btohqsg
like uh in future or gg uni and like,btohqsg
no offence but u seem way smarter,btohqsg
bcs i am stuck on what to take,btohqsg
ki seems super interesting but i rly love geog,btohqsg
If u might want to go UK  note that some UK unis do not accept KI as a legit subject,btohqsg
i thought KI replaces ur humans if ur sci stream,btohqsg
okay okay but i wanna study sg so it shld be okkk,btohqsg
for hybrid stream do they use sci stream cutoff or art stream cutoff?,btohqsg
i thought KI always replaces contrasting- i'm not sure though,btohqsg
scary idk what other arts to take apart from geog,btohqsg
KI is a valid contrasting for both arts and science combinations  but if you take hybrid then there is no need for a contrasting,btohqsg
KI would count as an arts subject,btohqsg
So you could take Geog  KI and 2 sciences,btohqsg
Should check what combinations the school offers though,btohqsg
omg tysm i actl didn't know that wtf,btohqsg
oh i get what u mean now okays,btohqsg
Depends I think  my school allows all students from either stream to take hybrid,btohqsg
i think i was abit confused ill look into that then under hybrid stream !,btohqsg
NY allows arts stream to take science combination,btohqsg
wait may i ask what sch are you hahrifjeifn,btohqsg
NYJC has free subject choice  so you can just go arts stream and pick 3 sciences,btohqsg
ohh ya i always heard ac has alot of weird combis,btohqsg
ACJC also has free subject choice  but you canâ€™t do that,btohqsg
ill look thr for hybrid thenðŸ¤©,btohqsg
We have like 10 hybrid classes every batch,btohqsg
but if i was to take ki and geog  wld it be better to take math over phy? if i was doing chem,btohqsg
Do you have a uni course in mind?,btohqsg
i was considering vet in melbourne/nusbut there's rlynot much info in it that i can find,btohqsg
That makes it risky to not take 2H2 sciences  cause many courses are gated by 2H2 science,btohqsg
If you are confident you wonâ€™t want to go to such courses  then feel free to consider KI and geog  but if not then try not to take such a combination,btohqsg
U need to be the top 5% in nus life science to even qualify  which is tough tbh,btohqsg
So amongst 300 students in life science  u need to be top 15 on the bell curve,btohqsg
only go into vet if u are passionate,btohqsg
being a vet is career ending for most,btohqsg
i guess i'll go for geog bcs it seems easier to score,btohqsg
ya i know that part & not much career progression,btohqsg
i heard KI there aren't much resources?,btohqsg
If u got passion just go for vet manz,btohqsg
whereas doctors say being doctor cannot earn much smh,btohqsg
lfucking 6 essays in 3h and,btohqsg
i find lorms essays in o's v fun hahsha,btohqsg
if its anyth like that it sounds fun,btohqsg
u take core geog or elect,btohqsg
memorized like 50+ examples for only 3 plate tech qns,btohqsg
elect zz but i read abt core for fun !!,btohqsg
as bad as h2 bio yes,btohqsg
if u all take pure geog,btohqsg
