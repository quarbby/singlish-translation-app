I think canon system wise its best to look between the m-series and the r10/r50/r7,btohqsg
Editing is what makes the images pop off,btohqsg
and iâ€™ve beaten my ass over it,btohqsg
the lens is legit what makes or break everything,btohqsg
i still canâ€™t achieve the photos i want STILL after editing sadly,btohqsg
Save money go japan buy lenes,btohqsg
nope my lens js not cripy,btohqsg
for what go japan bro ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
I bought my lenses in japan I saved about like about $800 sgd,btohqsg
I edc a $150 sigma 50mm f1.4,btohqsg
Editing can cover what your lens doesnt,btohqsg
and if u werenâ€™t using a prime here the bokeh wouldnâ€™t be on point or it wouldnâ€™t be as sharp,btohqsg
i edc a $40 50mm f1.4 too,btohqsg
will gatekeep my gear to my death,btohqsg
my biggest hint is that itâ€™s a very capable lens and it is AF,btohqsg
Was wondering why u don't post on ig,btohqsg
It's alright if u don't wanna share we chill,btohqsg
My biggest theory is ur capping,btohqsg
donâ€™t believe then donâ€™t believe lor,btohqsg
Oh man they dont do well at all so theres no point,btohqsg
Af lens in the $50 range is something super old or ain't real,btohqsg

I can only think of manual lenses,btohqsg
dont want share what gear i use,btohqsg
i also have a 35mm i cant rmb how much it costed but its fucked up w fungus,btohqsg
it was below $100  maybe $70. wasnâ€™t mine tho,btohqsg
What sorta magic ahh lens is this ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Bro made the lens for $50 frfr,btohqsg
iâ€™m legit nt gonna say what lens it is la but feel free to speculate,btohqsg

tbf i only wanted AF cos my cam doesnâ€™t have peaking,btohqsg
Dude u going to the canon Fiesta thing?,btohqsg
I dont support some of those creators so still contemplating,btohqsg
Radical kindess is not very kind..,btohqsg
I'm just gonna go there to network with the other creators like not the big ones,btohqsg
Dude if I ever meet u got stuff to talk about,btohqsg

Honestly the canon fiesta is prob gna be full of kitlens r10 r50 lol,btohqsg
Sigma 70-200 f2.8 35mm f2 and sony 50mm f1.8,btohqsg
Shucks thats a good contemp setup,btohqsg
Rn i have my r6ii and a few lenses,btohqsg
I love this setup I ain't changing gear for a solid 5 years or something,btohqsg
Probably get a 150-600 from sigma,btohqsg
I was contemplating getting that one lol,btohqsg
I ended up getting a 500mm f4 instead,btohqsg
Quite a big lens but its worth it definitely,btohqsg
The sharpness is crazy and its used by professional motorsport photographers,btohqsg
Sigh gotta delete i dont wanna get doxxed,btohqsg
You wanna take it to dms,btohqsg
