*BANK INDONESIA STARTS RATE DECISION BRIEFING*BI SEES FASTER  BIGGER FED FUND RATE CUT THAN EXPECTED*BI SEES CLEARER US RATE CUT PATH SUPPORTING INFLOW IN EMS,btohqsg
(Bloomberg)Beyond the knee-jerk moves a bigger rate cut would see long-end yields rise into year-end.If the Federal Reserve reduces interest rates by 50 basis points today:• It’s a strong reiteration of the committee’s very dovish reaction function  and where its priorities lie on its dual mandate• It will extend the economic cycle and send a message of complacency on inflation. US 10-year yields will climb in the subsequent months as a result  just like what happened in the wake of the Fed’s surprisingly dovish pivot in December 2023• With ~250 bps of cuts priced already for this cycle  it will behard for US 2-year yields to fallmuch further• The dollar will remain in a volatile downtrend overall  undermined by the Fed’s dovish reaction function  the hit to policy credibility and upcoming political noise  but intermittently supported by a steeper yield curve and bouts of risk-aversion• The stock rally will broaden out  with the rest of world outperforming US stocks. This is because:◦ The overall rates impulse will be small  it’s just a bringing forward of cuts that are already priced◦ The economic impulse will be larger  due to the message regarding the central bank’s reaction function  meaning those stocks which are more tied to the macroeconomic cycle benefit more◦ The rest of the world will experience both a positive growth impulse and an easing of financial conditions that is less qualified than that for the US◦ The economic projection and dot-plot matter  but less so than usual. This is because  with uncertainty around the policy action so extraordinarily elevated  the size of easing will provide the dominant message  and the rest is secondary nuance• Obviously  an aggressive cut that is delivered as being proactive and pre-emptive is more bullish stocks and bearish bonds than one that is accompanied by a sense of panic or intensified concernIf the Fed reduces by 25 bps:• It will be a major risk-aversion event  as it would disappoint all major markets at once (stocks  bonds  credit  EM) while upsetting the recent trend for dollar weakness• Volatility will surge  as a tightening shock is always more impactful than an easing surprise• The US 2s10 yield-curve would likely invert again• If the smaller-than-expected hike is accompanied by dovish forecasts and dot plot  then dollar strength won’t sustain for long  due to the hit to policy credibility• If the rate move is validated by optimistic forecasts and dot plot  then bonds suffer badly  the volatility impact sustains and dollar surges on combination of risk-aversion and yield support. US stocks would suffer immensely in subsequent days/weeks but the longer-term bull-market shouldn’t be derailed if the message is that the economic cycle isn’t overBloomberg Economics argues the Fed will provide a bullish50-bp cut.For the little it’s worth  I agree. Even though I’m much more positive than most on the US economy and believe that the Fed won’t cut rates nearly as much as priced over the next year  it would be much more problematic and damaging to growth and policy credibility tonowdisappoint today.,btohqsg
