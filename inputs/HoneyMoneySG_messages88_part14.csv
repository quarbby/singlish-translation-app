Citi rewards earn 10 Thank you points per dollar. 10 TY points can be converted to 4 miles.If you choose Citi rewards  base on your spending pattern  you need to get Amaze card.,btohqsg
I think can try chat assist? If not should be able to call in I think,btohqsg
So citi rewards is 4mpd and better than ocbc 90N,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best card to pay for uni fees? Isit uob abs?,btohqsg
You mean need amaze card to have 10 TY points?,btohqsg
Max $1k per statement month exclude Travel  hotel n airlines related. Check the TnC. Nobody can tell you everything in short message here. üòÑ,btohqsg
Without amaze card I still can get 10 TY points per dollar right? Depending on what spend based on tnc,btohqsg
U need to read TnC what offline purchase can get 4miles. The rest of offline get 0.4 miles.,btohqsg
Uob evol dont exclude traveling booking via online I suppose I don't see it in their tnc,btohqsg
Since uob Evol in their Cashback is listed as online payment so I suppose pay on trip. Com or Expedia work,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposes a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
HSBC Revo saw new say is now Exclude traveling,btohqsg
So amaze card is nothing to do with getting 4 miles right?,btohqsg
For some categories. For others you need to pair with amaze.,btohqsg
Convert offline to online so can u can earn 4mpd for online category when you make offline purchase.,btohqsg
I see. Thank you so much for the tips. Then I would probably use this card for online transactions then. Cos I don't plan to get amaze card. I will also read the tnc which category that gives bonus rewards,btohqsg
Whats the best CC for earning miles now?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs base on the GIRO deduction date. üòá,btohqsg
It's quite hard to hit $30 000 spending per month,btohqsg
When does UOB stash bonus interest come in? For the 2023 Christmas promo,btohqsg
U mean earmark bonus. Usually around the same time as your earmark happens,btohqsg
Hi all  i am currently using uob one credit card and SC unlimited cashback card.Would like to ask how can i pair either card to get good rates for spending overseas (similar to trust card) and still earn cashback?I understand topping up to wallet  such as youtrip  is excluded,btohqsg
If u want good rate then have to consider other cards pair with amaze  or top up amaze wallet. Uob one is visa hence ‚ùå,btohqsg
U can pair sc unlimited (now renamed as simply cash) with amaze.Although:1.5% cashback - 2.5% amaze cost + 0.5% amaze points = net 0.5% loss/costU might want to consider using higher (but more troublesome) Mastercards that give higher cash back if mcc matches.,btohqsg
I also wanna know‚Ä¶. 6.8% for moomoo cashplus promo is quite tempting even if it‚Äôs only for a month. Anyone sign up for this promo b4?,btohqsg

Which cards do you guys recommend for dental? Will hsbc revo and citi rewards get bonus points?,btohqsg
Citi Rewards with Amaze should work but not sure if extra 1% fee. HSBC Revo no,btohqsg
If you have UOB PPV also can.,btohqsg
But actually what is the benefit of paying with amaze linked for sg transactions? Citi rewards will still get bonus points if i use directly right?,btohqsg
Amaze converts offline spending to online spending  reason why you can get 4mpd. Dental MCC is not part of offline whitelist so you cannot use directly.,btohqsg
Ah i see!! Thx for the clarification,btohqsg
When you guys use HeyMax to check mcc and it recommends best cards for spending  why does it show cards for foreign spending when the vendors are in sg?,btohqsg
Hi  I have applied for the DBS altitude Amex card. have signed up for the card via dbs digibanking and and received the card on 31st Jan. Recalled seeing on milelion that there was a promo going on where I can get 16k miles if I spend $2k within 1 month with no annual fees. But the promo has been removed from the website on milelion and singsaver now. I called dbs to ask if I am still eligible for the promo. Was told that if I could provide the promo code  they can add it into the system for me. Does anyone know what is the promo code for this ?,btohqsg
"With a quick search with ""dbs altitude promo""  I found this:https://t.me/HMSGHive/1358I don't think there's any promo for DBS Altitude after 31 Nov 23.",btohqsg
Is it used to be 350 cash?,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I ask whether do your know why CPF deducted lesser for investment? Eg; if you choose 20k from your OA to invest in T bills  but why they did not deduct 20k but deducted slightly lesser? Is it there is a cost somewhere?,btohqsg
At maturity  your amount will go up to $20k  the difference being your interest,btohqsg
T bills pay you the interest upfront  as a discount to your initial investment value,btohqsg
does this mean that whatever i invested  then the interest they supposedly will give at maturity will be minus off first? then they deduct that amt from CPF. and at maturity  the returns will be back to the amt i invested?,btohqsg
Yes youll get back the original amount you invested  e.g. 20k,btohqsg
Hi all  last December I was busy so I paid my cc bill without checking my statement. Now I found that there's an annual fee and it's gst charges. Is it too late for me to waive it?,btohqsg
Just request for waiver and you'll see the refund in the current statement month,btohqsg
another qn  is it worth to get the citi premiermiles cc? like to pay loans or daily spending. but for loans  currently do not have any big loans to pay off. but heard the miles accumulation is ok? any suggestions?,btohqsg
Maybe you can read up the tnc to see if it fits your spending. All the best to your miles accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Can share which big loan allow customers to use Citi credit card to pay?,btohqsg
Maybe he is refering to citipayall using citi card,btohqsg
Keen to know more onmoomoo stock yield enhancement program? Any comment?,btohqsg
