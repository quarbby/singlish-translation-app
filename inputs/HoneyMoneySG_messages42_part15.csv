Content of the month: Panel Speaker for Seedly PFF 2023April was a relatively quiet month  other than the annual Seedly Personal Finance Festival 2023 held live at Suntec Convention Centre.

It was fun meeting people interested in personal finance and the vibe was great!Upcoming: It‚Äôs my birthday month and I will be taking a few days off to Penang  Malaysia for a short trip to wind down  relax and eat all the good food!

All have annual fee and cannot waive for 1st year right??,btohqsg
DBS Altitude fee can be waived  usually it's auto given when I request for it. But there should be some spending on the card for the bank to grant this,btohqsg

All my waiver requests always sexcessful,btohqsg
Last year I had an unsuccessful fee waiver request with my Krisflyer amex card (blue) as I hardly used it and was not going to use it for Telco bills. So amex said they are sad to see me go as their customer and will suggest I cancel my card instead haha,btohqsg
