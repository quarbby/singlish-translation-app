Now assume you got a general distribution,btohqsg
Just fit N gaussians to that distribution,btohqsg
Siao don't test each other's day proficiency leh,btohqsg
Not indepth  juz google.Long story short  you are finding a low dim version of high dim data,btohqsg
Does this have anything to do with central limit theorem,btohqsg
Basically u are just finding the most relevant attributes(principal components) which explains most of the variation in the data?,btohqsg
I'm lazy and google provided thishttps://stats.stackexchange.com/a/134283,btohqsg
I wouldn't say it's 'most of the variation',btohqsg
You are finding a low-dim version of whatever,btohqsg
If you talk about variation  you need a special 0-vector  or you have predefined distances,btohqsg
Ok finance guy lost in data,btohqsg
CLT is the statement that if you have many means  and that said means have finite variance  they will follow a gaussian  with a specific variance too.,btohqsg
Actually is data science more stats or comp sci driven,btohqsg
Of course stat concepts are important but then algorithm efficiency is impt as well,btohqsg
Com sci just a way to put the math into application,btohqsg
How to say? Stats is maff. You can develop math at this point still.CompSci most relevance is in algo. If your algo is trash  it means your math can't be implemented,btohqsg
Eh we pleb just use library ma no?,btohqsg
Library is there cos it covers common application ma,btohqsg
Means more likely than not whatever u trying to do got library,btohqsg
Very likely if you want to go conference imo,btohqsg
UNless you using the fattest general-use libraries  like TF/PyTorch/Keras,btohqsg
Just solve problem not do research,btohqsg
TBH TF/PyTorch/Keras all so fking fat  documentation massive huge that you can earn a living by just building off them for at least this lifetime,btohqsg
U doing com sci rn har,btohqsg
I mean all unis teach tensorflow now,btohqsg
Bruh 5 months ago where got obsolete,btohqsg
Ok la but not as widely used,btohqsg
Huh really? I never learnt TF for a single day  tho TBH I not in CS-ey course,btohqsg
Yea all machine learning/deep learning mods in nus uses tensorflow,btohqsg
All I can say about TF is that it has really complicated requirements.txt - you need someone who's ALREADY used to cloud/dev environments,btohqsg
And those are already a rarity within uni students,btohqsg
I mean like you can do that  you are at least a basic Software Engineer alr,btohqsg
interesting  IDK if the profs understand what they teaching  and if the students understand what they learning,btohqsg
They teach more of the theory la,btohqsg
Anyone knows what's the likely progression of salary for software engineer,btohqsg
lmao theory  you can even break down to 'simple' NumPy alr,btohqsg
The point of TF is to generalise everything,btohqsg
Dunno how to be more specific,btohqsg
If you go SV of course fast,btohqsg
I've no knowledge abt the industry,btohqsg
Can just focus on FAANG tbh,btohqsg
leetcode is somewhat public I think,btohqsg
IDEK how far Google L4 is from the top,btohqsg
Can see the recent ges survey,btohqsg
Most comp sci grads end up as software engineers,btohqsg
That one doesn't show progression ma,btohqsg
At least it is a gauge how the industry is doing,btohqsg
Huh I doubt it ba  unless the 'SWE' is a super generic term,btohqsg
For nus comp sci i think it is quite accurate though,btohqsg
Software engineer is a v common path,btohqsg
