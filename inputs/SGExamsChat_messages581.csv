Could've worked at changi airport tower station haha,btohqsg
sidenote but at what instance do u know that the info that you know is osa,btohqsg
I can't tell u what my old vocation does,btohqsg
all i can say is im a radar controller,btohqsg
Won't there be like an aptitude test or smth before they decide u can go to ur desired vocation,btohqsg
basically as long as what u do isn't found off the internet,btohqsg

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/foreign-syndicate-taiwan-malaysia-baccarat-formula-mbs-casino-3938776use excel -> go to jail,btohqsg

it's written in sg law  but yeah,btohqsg
plus if the pit boss think u are card counting,btohqsg
they will evict u from the casino,btohqsg
sg not so common cuz uk asian rep and stuff,btohqsg
isnt sg casino used to wash money,btohqsg
will kick u out and blacklist you,btohqsg

the best odds for player is bacarrat and black jack,btohqsg
i think youtube got some u can watch it up,btohqsg
something like player can stop at 16 pt but house need to draw above 14,btohqsg
so the chance of house to burst is higher,btohqsg
wish me luck buying toto later,btohqsg
tbeir formula should be following some form of card counting,btohqsg
the excel is just to keep track because its q hard for a normal person to keep count,btohqsg
i tried mental card counting for blackjack and lost the count by the 2nd hand,btohqsg
and ok cuz I noob LOL,btohqsg
but u can see the table luh,btohqsg
i was on a crusie ship,btohqsg
the small cards keep coming out,btohqsg
the the 1st round where u see all the high cards then u start,btohqsg
Is it just me or toto feels like a deadass scam too,btohqsg
card games like Baccarat and blackjack is statistics,btohqsg
u can even agar how much on the dollar u will lose,btohqsg
all the casino games / lottery is usually calculated out to make sure long term the house wins,btohqsg
they wan u to play one,btohqsg
It's just some ppl fork in abit of $ and overtime they don't even realize they end up losing more than they win,btohqsg
the casino makes nth from normal players,btohqsg
coz using normal distribution and probability  the chances of u winning is close to 50%,btohqsg
the true ppl they want are,btohqsg
Ppl like the high   the adrenaline   when they think they might win the $1 million,btohqsg
if u add up the rates  its not 100%,btohqsg
the additional few percent goes to the house,btohqsg
Don't join the dark side brather,btohqsg

Is the new kamen rider good?,btohqsg
But it was the SOF reggies doing it so they're just hehehaha while doing the PT which is nothing to them,btohqsg
Ah I don't really keep up with the new gens,btohqsg
I'm loyal to kamen rider ooo and kamen rider w,btohqsg
I prefer the lore of Heisei over Neo-Heisei,btohqsg
Anyone from hai sing or has sec 4 frnd in hai Sing sec?,btohqsg
you really quite funny today sia,btohqsg
I nvr heard of neo-heisei before,btohqsg
Hello guys! I got this tiktok account called socialstudies_hackers that offers tips for revision :) can see see,btohqsg
Just joined and decided that I want to reach out to more students haha so perhaps if doing holiday hw or revision  can refer to them,btohqsg
I taught over 20+ students during O level season this year for SS as well so I'm open to teaching :),btohqsg
Does anybody know abt the solar storm thats apparently gg to happen soon,btohqsg
Is it not like the enire earth?,btohqsg
Neo-Heisei is categorised as Post-Decade until Zi-O,btohqsg
no la  they put u infront of a comp with joystick  then they test ur orientation multitasking quick thinking skills and some basic flight instrumentation knowledge,btohqsg
anyone happen to know manadr surcharge hours ?,btohqsg
If I rmb correctly  Zi o is the strongest kamen rider cos he can control time or smth,btohqsg
ur pfp is yena right ?,btohqsg
Our outfields are shorter but more shag,btohqsg
me but i grad last yr alr.,btohqsg
there’s a sec school called hai sing ???,btohqsg
Is it true that got ppl faint during the walk LOL,btohqsg
honestly  take away the tiredness and load  it's pretty refreshing to see different parts of SG that I would normally not go,btohqsg
What happened to the walk? Does it stop in between then,btohqsg
one of my mates got heat exhaustion or mild heat stroke  which affected his liver. But I cannot remember which exercise now,btohqsg
I only know that guy is a rather successful businessman now,btohqsg
Not really  still have to assault the objective and what not,btohqsg
We had one exercise is literally walk 30km to 50km  depending on whether get lost. Just walk walk walk,btohqsg
Hm what kind of business lol,btohqsg
normally not one business. He owns a media company  a supplement company  a vending machine company  and 2 others I can't remember,btohqsg
All the vending machines you see at Anytime Fitness is one of his.,btohqsg
my most memorable location name in all the NS trainings is somehow Gali Batu flyover,btohqsg
then the most memorable story is the first or 2nd ICT  my officer refused to play cheat use handphone google maps to see where we are  but use his map and compass. He jumped down the 5 tonner  after 1 minute  decided on the direction to move  and it was opposite where we were supposed to walk towards,btohqsg
he's a nice and capable guy though. But it was pretty funny,btohqsg
"no la  it's to showcase ""skill""",btohqsg
Or tryna relive his OCS/SCS days lol,btohqsg
meanwhile i was on my 2nd call and I fell,btohqsg
I wonder what kept him that motivated,btohqsg
heard from my frends that rsi in tekong that they see commando being send into medical centre while asking for food to eat,btohqsg
one of my mates bend down pick up something  stand straight  then ouch and kenna slip disc,btohqsg
Ouch ouch that's on another scale of pain right there,btohqsg
Wtf bruh why do ns guys go thru so much rs things,btohqsg
I mean hey at least she found a pimp,btohqsg
It's as if local girls are  common red flags,btohqsg
gf can match the physique in the first place?,btohqsg
come on it's not as if you guys don't cheat too,btohqsg
Tbh  this isn’t sustainable at all  all the models are either on juice or dehydrated and starving themselves lol,btohqsg
If I pass IPPT but when I’m enlisting I’m overweight need to retake?,btohqsg
Yeah weight and bmi doesn’t reflect bf% or anything,btohqsg
Calisthenics  runners  they all have Low body fat  don’t need the gym always,btohqsg
Nope barely started As   I in MI,btohqsg
But I 19 in y1 tho LOL,btohqsg
Ain't it a good thing that u don't sound like it LOL,btohqsg
I thought u and that guy like late 20s and 30s,btohqsg
All the ripoffs taste like tofu,btohqsg
This one’s not bad as well,btohqsg
oh yea   then u can get 2nd servings,btohqsg
If you want free food just work fnb night shift,btohqsg
I don’t understand  if you wanna eat an egg  just eat a goddamn egg?,btohqsg
vegan ‘s pursuit to have more varieties,btohqsg
I find it funny how vegans wanna stop eating animals cuz of “inhumane treatment” blah blah but they’re perfectly fine with eating a fake version of it,btohqsg
cuz fomo maybe  they can’t stand regular eaters having so much variety compared to them,btohqsg
I’m not talking about the taste. They think it’s unethical to eat animals  but a person who says that  eating a fake version still seems kinda weird to me,btohqsg
why tho? if its fake then no animal needs to die,btohqsg
I always find it funny how this group chat's topics would be everything and anything under the sun except for school.,btohqsg
But you are still “fantasising” about eating meat  i don’t know a better way to phrase this,btohqsg
oh u mean like  it's still fetishising the meat eating experience?,btohqsg
Anyways  press on for the A Level kiddos and hopefully the PSLE kids got the secondary school they wanted :),btohqsg
Yep something this  if it were unethical they wouldn’t be doing it regardless of whether or not it was real meat,btohqsg
I’m referring to a specific group of vegans who think so  I’m no vegan btw,btohqsg
yeah it's not a bad argument. it's the reason why child sex dolls are banned even though they're fake and no kids are hurt,btohqsg
Yeah best example but it’s nsfw I didn’t wanna bring that in,btohqsg
Not all vegans avoid eating meat for environmental protection reasons though  some downright believe that humans aren’t supposed to eat meat at all and that killing animals is cruel  I’m referring to this group,btohqsg
in the long run fake meat will probably be much much cheaper tho  so that will win many of the arguments,btohqsg
Loneliness (especially amongst youths) seems to still prominent  I wanna do something about it but even with my skills from PW  I still can't think of smtg concrete to tackle the issue,btohqsg
Perhaps I hv a lot of self-doubt but yeah  anyone got thoughts on this?,btohqsg
Yeah I don’t see anything inherently wrong with fake meat,btohqsg
well  there ‘s not much u can do,btohqsg
Tbh  it’s possible to hit all your micro nutrient goals through a vegetarian diet  so you just need to complement it well and you’re good,btohqsg
nxt time there will be insect meats,btohqsg
already have! check out cricket powder,btohqsg
this one has always been a snack,btohqsg
Isn't there a coconut worm or smth,btohqsg
Cos it looks like that caterpillar from bug's life,btohqsg
Whatifalthist has videos on this on YouTube,btohqsg
I mean advancement of tech  ppl would naturally be more attuned to interacting online and less attuned having irl social interactions,btohqsg
You’ll just be seen as a weirdo  I have never seen anyone in SG go up and talk to a stranger unless it was for promotions or ads,btohqsg
Oh you mean hanging out irl more than texting online?,btohqsg
I mean for our gen lah  for older gen  they may prefer irl interactions,btohqsg
As compared to us digital natives ukuk,btohqsg
Based on an article I read,btohqsg
Ok I though you were 40 for a sec cuz smn here said so 😂,btohqsg
I bet he does it just for the ig pics,btohqsg
https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cz6IPBTBRdO/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==< y’all got see this robotic server?,btohqsg
I have nvr tried HDL my whole entire life,btohqsg
cant be because my jc peeps is 30-35 pax average,btohqsg
LOL even my reggies also complain about how ex that is,btohqsg
Do y'all actually use all the codes and stuff at hdl,btohqsg
what you're not seeing is all the others from their class who didn't join  because they can't afford and are embarrassed,btohqsg
Oh I heard that there's this ig acc for tmjc food,btohqsg
get rich friends who will treat u hdl,btohqsg
my friend treated 3 of us 40/pax,btohqsg
Only time i have ever eaten hdl,btohqsg
was when i didnt have to pay for it,btohqsg
eat in jb   u can eat more often,btohqsg
if i even have time to go malaysia,btohqsg
I think this yr i only went once and it was for like a competition,btohqsg
(no offence to any msians in the chat),btohqsg
Even the ph2  hydrochloric acid  not strong enough 😢,btohqsg
If they really wanted to go  $40 can work for one day lol,btohqsg
i don’t consider hdl to be value for money,btohqsg
Of course it isn’t  it’s just a fad and people wanna do it for the cools,btohqsg
Like $50 gets you so many weeks of grocery supplies,btohqsg
is js a sichuan style hotpot that ‘s modernized,btohqsg
ppl living in Beijing don’t eat as much hdl as Singaporeans,btohqsg
no offense   even the Sichuan sauerkraut fish isn’t fantastic,btohqsg
Same  I don’t get why my friends wanna spend like $20 on some shit that’s hardly filling  volume > quality,btohqsg
don’t get what the hype is abt for all these food,btohqsg
Emergency funds  but I wouldn’t count HDL as one of that though,btohqsg
If TikTok say it’s hype  people must buy it no matter what,btohqsg
Damn little  I have activesg gym membership  don’t even get protein bars (just resort to chicken breast)  I hardly eat out now that schools over  and no Spotify/Netflix/ any other bs,btohqsg
so u don’t listen to music,btohqsg
why does listen to music need $?,btohqsg
Spotify used to use with ads but ehh I deleted  I’m bored of music,btohqsg
to pay artists that ‘s what they say,btohqsg
A level period higher or lower?,btohqsg
I'm sick and tired of hot pot,btohqsg
how many times did u have it alr?,btohqsg
wow that's pretty good! investment not really spending tho right (as in i guess u hope to get it back one day),btohqsg
Oh I forgot your in NS already,btohqsg
Idk about y’all but I don’t get tired of food  I’ve been eating the same food in school for J1 and J2 every single day,btohqsg
i wish i cud spend within this,btohqsg
I spend abt 600 of my allowance alr paying for my friends housing/food bills,btohqsg
I not going out alrd gonna mug 💀💀💀,btohqsg
if I get A for H1 geog can,btohqsg
I accept hdl meals for geog tuition conversion,btohqsg
one hdl meal for one geog lesson,btohqsg
Ngl thats kinda worth for u,btohqsg
cuz geog tuition is like arnd 50/hr normally,btohqsg
Wasn't there free credits to begin with or smth?,btohqsg
How do u spend 80 on food,btohqsg
💀 u gotta be grinding allt,btohqsg
i just wanna slice people open,btohqsg
i get happy when i see blood,btohqsg
thats one canteen meal + a bottled drink,btohqsg
My point is stuff like that isn’t going to grant you true happiness  don’t wanna get too philosophical  they’re just temporary pleasures to help you cope with life  at least that’s how I see it,btohqsg
How long does it take for a sec 2 to get used to sec 3 life style LOL,btohqsg
cos Iw ask that easy way out guy again,btohqsg
But itll take too much effort,btohqsg
People who think there is such thing as true happiness would find it very hard to be happy,btohqsg
because at the back of their head they will be thinking if what im experiencing in the moment even happiness,btohqsg
u can find true happiness from simple pleasures in life,btohqsg
Noo cos u rmb that guy who asked for easiest  subj combi,btohqsg
Yep true  you just go where the path leads you  do what you like and stuff,btohqsg
Imma quote him after a period of time to ask him the same qn back,btohqsg
Either way no point for him to come and be arguing in a telegram chat of all places lmao,btohqsg
Ah so that's why the chat had thousands of msgs during his era,btohqsg
i forgot this was a thing,btohqsg
Good thing the deleting button works for you,btohqsg
Oh so he just came in to ask for a $100?,btohqsg
cant believe a levels is ending soon i feel like theres not enough complaining this yer,btohqsg
hi can anybody help me w coding rn LOL,btohqsg
ngl i miss arguign with him,btohqsg
ayy is the one who dmed me one day to ask me what is my problem,btohqsg
and why i keep fighting with him,btohqsg
then im like bro idh anything against u,btohqsg
ur the one dming me rn,btohqsg
i feel last yr had more complaints tho,btohqsg
Last year TYS was harder ngl,btohqsg
like abt the errata in paper 3 chem,btohqsg
cambridge shud pull something like that every year,btohqsg
U make the exam less abt how much uk ur content but more like,btohqsg
wait so the guy that dmed you isn’t even part of the group that you were commenting on,btohqsg
but he kept picking fights with people in the gc,btohqsg
so i told him to stfu,btohqsg
then he dmed me and asked me whats my problem,btohqsg
why i keep fighting with him,btohqsg
everyone sane was fighting with him,btohqsg
then i just told him bro im not the one who is dming others,btohqsg
in fact some of the insane people here also fought with him,btohqsg
i rmbr the first argument he had with people was abt why,btohqsg
Poly is superior to JC in every way,btohqsg
then people were trying to convince him that,btohqsg
it depends on individual to individual,btohqsg
If i go medicine poly has a higher chance,btohqsg
i think he’s just trying to comfort himself for making right choices,btohqsg
then when he realised his arguments were failing,btohqsg
he just ad hominem the people talking to him,btohqsg
he said smth abt how yt has no right to talk to him abt this cuz hes retaking a levels,btohqsg
but ngl thats like every other person nowadays,btohqsg
cuz josh also said the same thing,btohqsg
he said that i have no right to talk to him cuz i have no friends of my age,btohqsg
which like just confused me so i just said okay love that for you,btohqsg
hes still in this chat grp i think,btohqsg
Long time ago he sent me this,btohqsg
he gonna go in thr an echo chamber himself,btohqsg
ngl he reminds me of my friend who got rejected from nus merit scholarship so spent like 3 months convincing himself that the nanyang school scholarship which he got is btr and that NTU is better than NUS in every way possible,btohqsg
Ngl sounds like Aaron lim Jun Jie,btohqsg
The dude who got famous on YT for fighting during a lecture a few years ago,btohqsg
lol for me maybe bc he dk enough about me to attack or smth,btohqsg
but he multiple times just said,btohqsg
“oh i didn’t actually mean it this way. phrase wrongly”,btohqsg
ok yea irrelevant got it thanks,btohqsg
wait till he find the cold hsrd truth that there can be people in poly 10x smarter than a jc student,btohqsg
im saying this cuz i was from jc so,btohqsg
one of my friends knows way more stories of him than i do,btohqsg
Idk when was it it's damn long ago but,btohqsg
Studying for h3 maths or smth,btohqsg
Not happy that coffee bean ban studying during peak hrs,btohqsg
chan ric had an sgexams era too,btohqsg
he became a legend here before i joined,btohqsg
He should go upper thomson cbtl,btohqsg
then he end up becoming my uni junior,btohqsg
I would never chase people out from thr,btohqsg
Wait is his name chan ric,btohqsg
i rmb rushing smth for competition at cbtl at nex,btohqsg
My friend is in ntu physics rn,btohqsg
they chased me out when 15 mins to deadline LOL,btohqsg
ok if y1 higher odds of me TAing her,btohqsg
so maybe idw to know her anyway,btohqsg
Any hakken fans wanna buy the ticket? I know a person selling.. can nego abit LOL,btohqsg
chan ric actually maybe just grad,btohqsg
That's such a funky name ngl,btohqsg
guy asked prof during y1 ori whether he can take y4 mods as a freshie,btohqsg
How did he end up doing,btohqsg
uhh if hear correctly  not that well for his y1 mods,btohqsg
Ngl if y1 is too easy for him then I wud understand,btohqsg
Doesn't allow students to study during peak hours for more than 1h,btohqsg
lemme check what he's doing now,btohqsg
ok he end up second upper,btohqsg
good but not at the taking y4 mods in y1 level,btohqsg
I feel like so long as they're not taking up seats when super crowded and are not a nuisance,btohqsg
i'd say it's doxxing but the dude is such a legend,btohqsg
Wait he works at a insurance company,btohqsg
I'm looking at his linked in,btohqsg
like usual things people will do lor,btohqsg
like people that dk what they're doing,btohqsg
will have these sort of things,btohqsg
Then work experience like q minimal,btohqsg
its more than me lol i have no work,btohqsg
For someone who wants to do year 4 mods at a year 1 level idk I would expect it to be like,btohqsg
tbh i expected him to be those do phd kind,btohqsg
He seems like a cs reject,btohqsg
He has the cs reject profile,btohqsg
is my linkedin more or less empty than his,btohqsg
like pure quantity yours is less but,btohqsg
80% of his linkedin is what he did in ns,btohqsg
so essentially mine has more quality than quantity,btohqsg
like he has 4 entries and 3 of them are just faculty club roles with zero elaboration,btohqsg
your one entry says more than his 4,btohqsg
mine used to be like that,btohqsg
now it's all research based bc obv yea,btohqsg
mine is just relevant internships and awards :/,btohqsg
my ex is a mutual connection LOL,btohqsg
i think she's his cca senior,btohqsg
ok i have a problem with this guy,btohqsg
idk what coaching you're doing when two of three students are psle,btohqsg
Or still waiting for uni to start,btohqsg
why is AI a skill in tutoring LOL,btohqsg
most of the guys from my jc put their ns inside,btohqsg
I see it and think to myself,btohqsg
my linkedin was completely empty till after i started my phd,btohqsg
Damn how little shit have u done in ur life that something almost all guys in sg have gone through deserves a worthy mention,btohqsg
i mean me included last time but,btohqsg
at that point i just don't use linkedin LOL,btohqsg
I feel like I see it I get more depressed,btohqsg
have you tried seeing their resumes,btohqsg
you think thats depressing try having no resume,btohqsg
I feel like a decent LinkedIn at this age shud have some decent level of internships and volunteeting,btohqsg
So that u can replace NS,btohqsg
But then again people also drc abt linkedin,btohqsg
i was too depressed to do anything until after ns,btohqsg
My friend out sgexams reddit moderator as experience,btohqsg
i mean i managed to use what i did on a pokemon forum to leverage an intern,btohqsg
guys guys  Iw build gd portfolio for med  but now as y1 in MI   my grades are staggering soooo should I uk apply for shadowing to brush up folio or focus on my acad first,btohqsg
Btw my friend who's rhe ntu student,btohqsg
Isnt this the grp for reddit,btohqsg
As much as I like to say that academic isn't impt,btohqsg
It's ur bread and butter for shit like med,btohqsg
when it comes to competitive courses people will have both acads and portfolio,btohqsg
