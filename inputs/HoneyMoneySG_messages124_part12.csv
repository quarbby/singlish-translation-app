Hi there  can anyone recommend a good credit card for mainly game micro transaction (mainly google).Occasionally spend on food and online purchase as well  Shopee  Lazada  Tabao etc,btohqsg
Is the Krisflyer Uob account recommended?,btohqsg
Hello! I use the DBS Digibot and found out that the merchant I’m paying is under insulation  Masonry  plastering  stonework contractors.I can’t use woman world card? Is it in exclusion?,btohqsg
Hmm hsbc promo not out yet.. but i already transferred the incremental.May i ask If the promo come out tmr morning with the same concept  will my transferred incremental not be eligible?,btohqsg
It will be eligible if the new promo of Aug is announced with same mechanics,btohqsg
I also received same. Were told to call in. So what did u say or what did they ask. Thanks,btohqsg
Citi rewards card? Then pair w amaze fr offline spend,btohqsg
Anyone got the 8% interest top up already?,btohqsg
Not for me   by the way  after one month  can move the funds out right,btohqsg
I just told them it is for bonus interest earningUsually when bank calls u  don’t lie already. Tell them the truth. The team that calls u is usually only concerned about fraud / anti money laundering. They won’t care about you abusing rewards.,btohqsg
#dpUOB$ transactions are still considered as part of minimum spend for UOB EVOL card,btohqsg
New HSBC EGA still not out,btohqsg
Hi guys  just open the SCB bonus saver inJuly. Want to understand when will be the interest into account? Yesterday got a very small amount interest in only,btohqsg
Hey guys I just did a ~S$825 funding into my IBKR via Wise. PayNow SGD to Wise  Exchange to USD and Transfer USD to IBKR. Fees works out to be S$3.80. That's more than the $2 conversion fees IBKR charge!Has things changed to be unwise to use Wise to fund IBKR? Sorry if this question has been discussed before here 😁,btohqsg
i'm not sure why you didn't just do the FAST SGD into IBKR... and pay the USD2 transaction fee to do a Spot FX SGD into USD?,btohqsg
3.55% up to 2M3.65% more than 2M,btohqsg
is wise offering better exchange rates than ibkr?,btohqsg
Is it out? I saw hsbc website still july,btohqsg
I just checked HSBC website... still July.,btohqsg
Hi all  may I know when will the ocbc 360 interests (salary  save & spend) will be credited? I've fulfilled all the requirements yet I didn't get any interest yesterday,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword“ocbc interest”to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply. Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
UOB One first xxx promo  now may be a good timehttps://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/221605,btohqsg
Jumping into promotions without going through the tnc or confirming if they can meet the requirements. 🙃 it will help for ease of mind that we do these first,btohqsg
Is there any way to check first 200 availability?,btohqsg
exactly. Hence I dare not SMS into HSBC EGA now without reading the official TNC.1. later kenna July promo still (not refreshed)2. later got hidden tricks,btohqsg
In any case  received the hsbc sms for qualifying for everyday+ rewards,btohqsg
SCB Esaver is officially out though,btohqsg
For 4789 transaction in NZD  may i know what card to use since CRMC exclude this and also my Lady’s card is not under transport (mine under travel). i see they categorised this 4789 under transport. Thank you,btohqsg
The fees of the Wise method was much lower then. And I have the impression that it is faster than Fast SGD into IBKR then convert,btohqsg
SGD Fast into IBKR is under 1 hour.FX Spot convert is instant.Wise faster ah?,btohqsg
I wonder why they dont have instant deposit as well.. even moomoo   tiger have,btohqsg
Thanks. When I last tried to transfer SGD to IBKR  it took me 1 - 2 business day.I read from another telegram group that Wise fees has risen,btohqsg
Ibkr doesn't support DDA unlike the brokers u listed 😁,btohqsg
i think IBKR  being a more cautious and i believe more regulated entity  intentionally imposed some manual checks before reflecting received funds into the account.,btohqsg
If sending and receiving currency is the same  there won't be any fee.,btohqsg
That's not what i experienced. I was charged S$2.28 for converting S$818.02 to USD (US$610.56). And another fees of US$1.13 for transferring US$611.87 to IBKR Citibank USD account.,btohqsg
Your right... I just used their website calculator... There's indeed a fee of usd1.13. I only used it to transfer GBP  which is free strangely.,btohqsg
Any special signup bonus for UOB Krisflyer card ? I’m already an existing UOB card holder,btohqsg
No. Maybe at most first spend will get 5k miles.,btohqsg
If you are new to uob kf card.,btohqsg
Means 07 Aug? Or you meant within 1 week,btohqsg
More like 12 Aug. Weekend and public holiday are not included.,btohqsg
Hi  is there any recommendations on which credit card to use in overseas?(china),btohqsg
Thanks! Seems like now is still wise to fund GBP into IBKR via Wise but no longer so for funding USD into IBKR 😂,btohqsg
