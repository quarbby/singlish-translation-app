is it worth to move 100-150k from uob one account to uob stash account for the Earmarking of Incremental Fresh Funds and Cash Credit ? Since uob one interest is higher,btohqsg
Hi guys  could I check if anyone has managed to get any cashback or miles for online course and what is the card you use please?,btohqsg
depends on the mcc  do a search onheymax.ai,btohqsg
Some considerations.1. Is uob one fund qualified as fresh fund for uob stash?2. Assume u have 150k in uob one. Uob stash only holds up to 100k. What are you gonna do with remaining 50k? Leaving it in uob one will earn low interest.Havent done the maths but i have a feeling its not worth.,btohqsg
