Hi may i double check is there no woodlands for the upcoming SBF? Thanks!,btohqsg
Bto woodland Feb 2024 yes but sbf no,btohqsg
Can we apply the multi generation scheme for sbf?,btohqsg
Ya but how we will know,btohqsg
Hope won't crash with sbf dates line,btohqsg
Maybe they are Yishun projects from 2022 BTO exerciseThe locations are not very happening  20 - 30 mins walk to the nearest stations at either Khatib or Yishun,btohqsg
Wow 30min walk is far I supper is far like near Yishun ring road or the one nearly the seletar dam,btohqsg
Just curious ü§î sbf example put Yishun how we know the block and floors,btohqsg
The completion year is the bigger problem. Got some newly launch Bto will even finish before some of this sbf.,btohqsg
so when they launch SBF officially they‚Äôll mention till the block and unit number ?,btohqsg
We applying as a married couple expecting a baby this year  does that mean I can opt for the priority scheme? I tried to go to the priority scheme page on HDB it‚Äôs not loading so any explanation on how priority scheme works and how to opt in for that during application would be much helpful thanks in advance,btohqsg
Oh we have sbf chat where is the link?,btohqsg
No buses to mrt stn ?,btohqsg
~20 mins to the bus interchange  excluding waiting time,btohqsg
That‚Äôs very long . Maybe that‚Äôs y not many ppl took it up,btohqsg
That is a guess on my part thoughThere were 2 or 3 projects in Yishun during that launch  so might explain the supply that will be available in the upcoming February SBF,btohqsg
üò±Ha ha  gonna study where the plots are again later,btohqsg
"Some projects in Yishun were really nice for home kind... But ""living"" may be another thing if the person has to go out for work",btohqsg
Still every bto is good btoFor some just want a place to stay,btohqsg
anyone knows when would the next BTO/SBF will take place? i heard its February but any likely dates?,btohqsg
Generally the so call ulu bto the price is slightly cheaper as compare to those near the mrt,btohqsg
As long within their budget why not üòÅ,btohqsg
next BTO is Feb  SBF I not sure,btohqsg
Feb .. wait for hdb to give dates. We all here don't know one.,btohqsg
When push comes to shove  those really desperate and need a flat will jus take it up?,btohqsg
the feb bto dates no indication? last few years feb bto anyone knows if beginning mid or end feb?,btohqsg
Wait for HDB to announce. No fixed schedule one,btohqsg
Usually end Feb but no fixed date,btohqsg
Hopefully before launch ah  makes sense to be before the next launch,btohqsg
But haiya knowing how they work so bochap and anyhow won't be surprised...,btohqsg
Last time they used to mail physical booklets before flat selection. Do they still do that?,btohqsg
Anyone knows if we can check available units before selection of unit email receive?,btohqsg
