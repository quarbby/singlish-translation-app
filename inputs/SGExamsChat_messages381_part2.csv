why's bro having a debate rn.  inadequate  no one is perfect  we'll always have some strengths and weaknesses. but imo  if  you're constantly failing  then maybe it's not the effort that affects your grade but your studying technique. some subjects/topic require a different approach. based on my experience  let's say i practise chemistry. learning about the blast furnace is all about memorising  so I make flash cards for those chapters. on the other hand there's chapters like moles which require calculations  so I'll have to do more practises in order to excel in that topic. so maybe it's the studying method that holds you back.,btohqsg

Do you think students should wear school uniform,btohqsg
I feel that they should be abolished cos school uniform for girls are extremely sexualised,btohqsg
i think its a good thing bcs it reduces class divisions in the classroom,btohqsg
like u shd be going to sch to receive an education not to be a competition of who has the latest  most trendiest clothes,btohqsg
and obv since not everyone is able to afford nice clothes  its gonna lead to bullying and stuff,btohqsg
i feel like maybe we can have gender neutral uniforms? that would solve some problems,btohqsg
For real I hate wearing skirts,btohqsg
ITS SO HOT AND STUFFY EH,btohqsg
Ok la the pe attire pog,btohqsg
its like some kind of waterproof material,btohqsg
PLS there's alw this patch of sweat at end of the day damn gross,btohqsg
it doesnt seem to absorb liquids that well,btohqsg
the sweat stain would be there tho,btohqsg
yeah the sweat stain alone is gross imo,btohqsg
doesn't matter if got febreeze idt the sight of the stain alone is appealing to much of the public,btohqsg
but srsly tho sg weather.... cant help it sia,btohqsg
We would start calling 20 deg weather a heatwave and people would have heatstroke,btohqsg
Unless you got dem juicy back muscles,btohqsg
That â€˜s why Uniform is bad,btohqsg
But some uniform looks really smart.,btohqsg

bcs they are too lazy to change,btohqsg
A dude just asked me why do girls wear shorts underneath their skirt ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
most of us dont actually feel it being airy so,btohqsg
If I donâ€™t wear shorts I wonâ€™t feel comfy,btohqsg
lend him a skirt to wear and ask if he can feel his birdie flying in the wind,btohqsg
Neutral about this. I feel that options should be available e.g. Allow wearing of tudung  allow choice of skirt or pants.,btohqsg
the current one is so bad,btohqsg
