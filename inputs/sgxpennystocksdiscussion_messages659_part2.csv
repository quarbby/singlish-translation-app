🎉Pika World Quick Bite – 3 June 2022🎉💎It’s Green Once More💰The equity market rose on Thursday as OPEC decided to increase its oil production. Now the court is on Friday’s job report. The move by OPEC can undoubtedly help put a cap on inflation  which will support equity markets that are on a jitter due to the inflation scare.⏳May Payroll Data🔦Investors could be expecting cooler May job data  which isn’t bad for some analysts. The unemployment rate is expected to hover around 3.5%  similar to last month’s 3.6%. On Thursday  we saw a poorer reading on ADP payroll data which is now casting a shadow over whether today’s job report can even meet the lowest expectations. Nevertheless  market participants can feel relieved that even as hiring might have slowed  signs of retrenchment have not increased. This points to a robust labour market.🪜3 Potential Reasons for a slow down in hiring🔫We already see many sectors at their pre-covid levels  thus reducing the need for mass hiring. Moreover  we are still seeing some level of labour supply constraint. Therefore the pool of right fit workers may not be readily available. Lastly  with the Fed beginning its quantitative tightening process  companies may react to become more conservative in their hiring pace  given an expected weakening in demand.Pika World will be looking at more economic data as major indices showed some strength.It is 3 June  Friday  10.35 am in Singapore and 10.35 pm in New York. Pika World wishes all friends a cooling weekend ahead!,btohqsg
