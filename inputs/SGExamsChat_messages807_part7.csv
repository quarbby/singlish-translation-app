The one who follows the book,btohqsg
"As usually the dad seem like the happy go lucky kind of every family nowadays  tbf  most dad nowadays are the ""Your life"" kind",btohqsg
Your life  not my prob ðŸ’€,btohqsg
But my dad be like that is probably harder to get than pharma,btohqsg
But i mean if i never try  i will never know,btohqsg
The amount of applicants to sia is not just Singaporeans rmb that,btohqsg
And if i badly want sth  i will prob put in 100x effort,btohqsg
Do they open their management programme roles year round,btohqsg
My mum is basically on the mindset that she is paying for my pharma degree for nth,btohqsg
very sad that a psc scholar doesn't understand the value of a degree,btohqsg
She seems to be unable to discern the difference between a university and vocational training. That's all I can say,btohqsg
This one says graduates w 1-2y working experienceðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Yes internships count in work experience,btohqsg
yes  this role is specifically for people with less than 2 years of experience. quite the refreshing take from those requiring minimum years of experience  no?,btohqsg
I clicked and it gave me 145 jobs to choose frðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
lmk if you want a simulated interview for any of those positions. no judgement  you come in and out like any other interviewee at my place of work. down to asking the security guard for a guest pass...,btohqsg
I hate that portion of every new job,btohqsg
Waiting for the pass at the security,btohqsg
It's like you are the most clueless kid in the block and don't know where to wait or stand,btohqsg
I would think a big company like SIA would yield good returns,btohqsg
But typically do ppl ask for pay during the interviews,btohqsg
8 month's bonus for the past 2 years  no kidding,btohqsg
they ask for last drawn salary if you have working experience.,btohqsg
Lemme see which roles i wanna apply,btohqsg
But entry level jobs basically you take what they offer  no?,btohqsg
Maybe musician can take in the third round of 8 month bonus,btohqsg
My last drawn salary is kinda my mediocre intern salaryðŸ’€,btohqsg
don't mention it  if you get in sia will be your first job,btohqsg
They won't be so evil to give you intern pay,btohqsg
Apparently SIA has 2 rds for interview,btohqsg
First one is a video interview,btohqsg
If you got degree  always ask,btohqsg
Anything below degree just take it or leave it,btohqsg
The people I have interviewed typically don't ask about salary,btohqsg
This is for actual interviews  not simulated.,btohqsg
But there is some sort of understanding regarding last drawn,btohqsg
(which is why  by the way  you don't accept lowball offers for your first job),btohqsg
Usually only aft they get the job then the company will offer sth?,btohqsg
It will be on the offer letter,btohqsg
But I don't think it hurts to discuss compensation,btohqsg
Or at least  expectations for compensation,btohqsg
Sth interest me but it is 12h shift w night shift,btohqsg
What kind of shift is that,btohqsg
Don't they have 2-3 days of off,btohqsg
Or am I mistaken for another job,btohqsg
I believe the max is 44h a week,btohqsg
Off day every week cause last I've checked on shift jobs like these have at least 2 day off a week,btohqsg
the max only applies to jobs that fall under employment act. ie jobs paying less than 2.6k-ish,btohqsg
Is it weird to apply same company more than 1 job,btohqsg
In fact it's common but you have to check the HR policy of the company so listings have a caveat that says they only review your application as 1 common one,btohqsg
