Hi  anyone funding USD100K to Webull Moneybull to get the USD3K signup gift? Feels a little scary to fund so much money into Webull. Moneybull is so opaque.,btohqsg
Hi. I bought something that costs $300 via grab pay. For some reason  I don't want the item and the vendor refunded $300 back to my grab wallet. Noted I couldn't transfer anywhere else because the top up was made with cc earlier. I wonder is there any tips to spend or move the money from grab wallet. My hawker spending would take months to finish off $300. I wouldn't want to use grab pay to buy something expensive and noticed that using cc for that and being rewarded by cc is much better than earning grab points. Also I don't take grab transport or grab food,btohqsg
grabpay can move to your paynow no?,btohqsg
Cannot. Can't even transfer to another wallet also,btohqsg
That's the disclaimer. Unfortunately I will need to use the money for grab pay or grab services,btohqsg
That's correct. When you pay with GrabPay it's equivalent to top-up.,btohqsg
Hi anyone applied this card and managed to get $20 bonus cash after spending on selected merchants ? Cos the terms and condition didn‚Äôt state when we can get the $20,btohqsg

How do I know if my money bull cash (sgd 5k) will earn additional $80 USD if I continue to hold it? Is there any promotion or tracker I can see if I am correctly enrolled? Sorry if this has been asked before (can't find answer via searc),btohqsg
Well can try. But they have written clearly that no refund.,btohqsg

Is the step below correct?1). Open webull account.2). Transfer in SGD136k3). Redeem the US$3k,btohqsg
Unfortunately chat has been offline for days for me. And sending a message never got a reply yet. Is this the same for all?,btohqsg
S$136K is not enough  need to follow Webull rate in T&Cs.I put in S$138K back then,btohqsg
Yes I do so frequently. It works very well.What is the question u would like to ask?,btohqsg
My household has 2 lady cards. We selected:1. Travel + dining2. Travel + fashionWe found it very useful to be able to use at many overseas places.For the other categories we are using:A) Citi cashback (groceries)B) Maybank fnf (pharmacy  5812  groceries)Finally we have as ultimate backup uob krisflyer.,btohqsg
For the fashion  is anything clothes stores  etc related is fine right?,btohqsg
No. This is the one u need to be very careful of.Fashion category of uob lady is one of the more tricky one to use.U can however do the amaze + empty wallet trick to find out the correct mcc first. Then only use lady fashion if it matches.Credits: milelion for screenshot.,btohqsg
unfortunately my groceries is below $800/mth,btohqsg
U might want to consider Maybank family and friends then. $800 across 5 categories. Surely can hit?,btohqsg
And my usual tip. U can consider sub your parents / parents in law for their grocery spending.Whether u want to collect back the money from them or not that‚Äôs up to u la.,btohqsg
But it does cap at $25/cat,btohqsg
$312.50 Loh.It‚Äôs to cater for people who say they cannot spend $800 a month on groceries.I mean there are 2 choices provided for big or small grocery spender albeit still need $800 spend a month.I have to say this although May get flamed. No use complaining I can‚Äôt hit xxx spend a month so I cannot benefit. Figure it out! Don‚Äôt miss out!,btohqsg
Does amaze+citi rewards qualify for singsaver promotion to spend min. $500?,btohqsg
Citi cashback is capped $80 cashback a month.Citi cashback+ (1.6% cashback) has no cap,btohqsg
Understood  i‚Äôve made sure all spend is eligible just that i was worried citi will not count transactions done with amaze  and not citi card,btohqsg
will count if Amaze* is not excluded,btohqsg
Same.. my friend used her CPF to buy ILP/endowment plan  recently matured..  end up  if put in OA with compounding will get higher returns.. and we are just talking about 2.5% compounding!,btohqsg
