I'm sure the transactions for top up would be stated as top up. Just don't top up to Grab wallet  as simple as that.,btohqsg
"Yup  already mentioned in previous post ""Next month not as good!""",btohqsg
This is government services lol. Amaze don't change MCC. Tnc states what's excluded and you can try to verify againstheymax.aifor other spend MCC.,btohqsg
Anyone know the mcc code of Changi pay ? Donâ€™t find on heymax,btohqsg
any advise on best MPD/cashback cards for big ticket item spend? i.e. wedding banquet,btohqsg
Does this help? I used it to pay at papa rich sad to say is 5399 not 5812 or 5814,btohqsg
Hi all  i holding dbs visa altitude card.will these dbs point be transferred to another dbs card if i cancel the altitude card?,btohqsg
"I think you might find an answer when searching for ""wedding card"" here",btohqsg
I want to use Changi pay to do payment on Changi app to buy some cosmetics,btohqsg
Most likely 5399 unless others have Something to share  block your card then do a simulated transaction to be sure,btohqsg
Card blocking only works Dbs card I believe which I do not have.,btohqsg
Yes I am gonna ditch this card. Sayonara.I left with citi rewards mastercard and ocbc 90Â°N mastercard.Is it OK to have both credit cards as mastercard? Should I switch to ocbc 90Â°N visa?,btohqsg
Great cos what I know mastercard can only be used to pay AIA insurance renewal premiums.,btohqsg
But both cards also don't get rewards from paying insurance..,btohqsg
I actually use them to hit the spend so that I can get their annual fee waived,btohqsg
Not planning to get the 10k miles on OCBC 90Â°N?,btohqsg
Oh? I already got the card since 1 Jan. Am I still eligible? How to be eligible? Sorry. There might be a post but I'm unsure,btohqsg
I mean the renewal miles. Pay the annual fee for the 10k miles.,btohqsg
Is it worth it by dollar cost? Sorry need a little enlightenment,btohqsg
If youâ€™re desperate for miles  perhaps yes. Else at cpm of 1.9+  not really.,btohqsg
Hi what is the best miles card for private hospital bill now?,btohqsg
I realised that HSBC T1 does not accept hospital bills and my wife is delivering in 14 days. Help please!,btohqsg
FYI im going to thomson medical hospital,btohqsg
Amex KFA  Maybank Visa Infinite and SCB Journey card (1.2mpd) Amex KFB 1.1mpd,btohqsg
Thanks for the response! Does thomson medical accept amex card?,btohqsg
DBS live fresh seems to be nerfedThe following changes to the DBS Live Fresh Card Cashback Programme will be effective from 1 March 2024:1.Cardmembers will earn unlimited0.3% base cashbackon all eligible spend.2.Upon hitting the minimum spend requirement ofS$800per calendar month  Cardmembers will enjoy up to6% cashback on Shopping and Transport spend(includes in-store  contactless and online transactions made in Singapore and overseas):â€¢Additional 5.7% cashback on Shopping (capped at S$50 per calendar month)â€¢Additional 5.7% cashback on Transport (capped at S$20 per calendar month)3.With the introduction of the additional cashback above  the card benefits of up to 5% cashback on Contactless and Online spend  and the extra 5% Green Cashback on Sustainable spend will be discontinued.,btohqsg
So i literally cannot use any card at thomson medical for miles ah?ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
You only have Amex? Can apply for scb journey?,btohqsg
Both amex cards not accepted. The maybank visa has a ridiculous annual fee. And Im still waiting for april for a full cycle to restart my scb free gift,btohqsg
According toheymax.aiHSBC Advance card gives cash rebate.Miles doesnâ€™t seemed to offer anything higher than 0.4mpd,btohqsg
Can also consider amex platinum card... good esp for new customer as need to clock $6k to get the bonus miles,btohqsg
But OP going Thomson Medical which doesnâ€™t accept Amex.,btohqsg
Heymax is inaccurate for this case  it shows earned miles by HSBC T1â€¦,btohqsg
Wah sad.. heng i going for mount alvernia,btohqsg
Actually UOB Visa Infinite Metal works (1.4 mpd for hospital)  heymax never shows it ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
This has a ridiculous annual fee also right?,btohqsg
Also generous sign up bonus ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
Sigh  I guess I can only stick to standard charted cashback card for that measly 1.5%,btohqsg
ocbc infinity got 1.6%  slightly better. sign up as new customer can get ipad too  with $500 spend within 30 days,btohqsg
OCBC does not have hospitals in eligible spend right?,btohqsg
Unless itâ€™s Voyage card. Again  hefty annual fee ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
Scb is a good option. But im waiting for my free moneysmart/singsaver gift in April,btohqsg
Tried blocked amaze and transact . It did not show up on activities,btohqsg
Donâ€™t block the card. Just turn off everything in settings (online  in-store  overseas etc etc) but leave the card unlocked OR link to empty wallet.,btohqsg
Hi can i ask for the sc bonussaver account is it worth it to use? I am curently using ocbc 360,btohqsg
I went with the moneysmart promo. Does that count as sign up bonus?,btohqsg
Anyone know for the UOb earmark promo  would the funds remain in the account just that the available balance will be less the earmarked amount?,btohqsg
the 20 000 miles welcome bonus with minimum spend of S$1 000 can use HSBC T1  but only 1k is sufficient,btohqsg
Think u just need to apply a high annual fee if u want miles. But then again these cards all need 120k salary requirements,btohqsg
Hello everyone. Anyone know if the amaze card can use in Taiwan?I tried to pay a wedding shoot company  they keep saying got declined.Already confirmed that both my amaze card and Citi rewards card enabled overseas use.,btohqsg
