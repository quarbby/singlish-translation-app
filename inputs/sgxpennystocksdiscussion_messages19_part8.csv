they bochup cos tw mit they steady,btohqsg
Yes..My nagging feeling.....since all these Telegram chat groups were set up  it's even easier to swing sentiments and trap retailers....I wonder at times if these groups do more harm than benefits,btohqsg
I think bb aren't so free to do this....probably just shortist retailers,btohqsg
Same same .. for sharejunction. DYODD,btohqsg

was there any query by Taiwan stock exchange for price movement in Taiwan? it has been going limit up for a number of days,btohqsg
No need to do themselves..just sent a few runners into chats can achieve the same....of coz this is just my guess.. I'm not a BB nor am I an experience retailer trader....I'm just thinking how easy it is to plan messages or spread rumours nowadays,btohqsg
not sure if they are so ‚Äòon‚Äô as ours,btohqsg
Ppl who entered high...on tenterhooks now....most easily influenced,btohqsg

0.01166 wow too late buy 1166 today haha,btohqsg
It's sad...but many retailers dun do sufficient research and not much conviction to hold....easily swayed by telegrams and sj,btohqsg

procurri  aem they collected more than  30%; ISDN ran too fast. Their 30% target not there yet..and they most probably have a budget for ISDN collection... so this selling is a good method to depress for further collection..just 2 cts.,btohqsg
agree .....as there was no negative surprise news announcement after query,btohqsg
MT x VP % gain comparison  1 year.,btohqsg

They closed at 130pm so monday see if the selling here affects there,btohqsg
they can use a proxy to buy and then do a married deal just like the 10m share they bought at between 23-24cts. So lets see over the coming months.,btohqsg
Similar case in raffles edu most likely,btohqsg

yup life is abt making choices...if we do this  if we do that....lol,btohqsg
A lot are addicted . Including me.,btohqsg
