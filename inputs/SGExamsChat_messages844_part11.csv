How long is the whole trip in terms of time?,btohqsg
even if i took it from the interchange,btohqsg
or made a transfer bus route,btohqsg
i meant the bus interchange was more open to public,btohqsg
I always loved the part when they are at punggol area,btohqsg
when bus 39 or some other buses were introduced later on,btohqsg
LOOL yeah  a lot of ppl would prefer to travel down to the starting point now,btohqsg
You get to be the lofi girl in punggol,btohqsg
i take the 7am~ bus in the morning as well  can still guarantee a seat,btohqsg
coz one of the nearest bus stops heading towards the other city area & generally in the opposite direction of my hdb estateis only like what? 2 or 3 bus stops away from punggol temp int?,btohqsg
bus 39 originally was at the original interchange,btohqsg
that time  tampines concourse was at the roadside of tampines int,btohqsg
he saed one of my classmate in 2021 i heard,btohqsg
i only recognize staff  classmates etc i was more used to,btohqsg
because its in the middle of nowhere,btohqsg
then the sch principal silenced us not to say,btohqsg
was the sch principal angeline or the new one,btohqsg
omg no wonder the dnt teachers were so short-staffed back then...,btohqsg
both had the same name i think,btohqsg
ya worst part he was sweating somewhere in sec one after that incident,btohqsg
at least even when he was being investigated,btohqsg
apparently he was in a straits time news before,btohqsg
he had decent reputation so he was not charged and fired i heard,btohqsg
my ite east class advisor (form cher) also got into a motorcyclist accident before,btohqsg
i don't understand this sort of shit either,btohqsg
then the sch principal asked me to exchange place w the victim cause we had 2 dnt teacher,btohqsg
which 2na class were u in,btohqsg
and the long route after the twin bus stop was creepy,btohqsg
i heard a lot of the exp students in the same year batch as the both of us  had a lot of grievances,btohqsg
i nearly got expelled by the previous sch principal,btohqsg
ya technically i transferred bcs of the sch environment,btohqsg
which year did u transfer out,btohqsg
toxic tbh that the sch silenced us not to say,btohqsg
i wanted to transfer as well,btohqsg
but mrs huang silenced my options bro,btohqsg
ALL 3 of my primary schools were better than her,btohqsg
which town is the route  part of?,btohqsg
LOLOLOLOL no wonder she got forced to step down,btohqsg
twin bus stops.. like double bus stops ah,btohqsg
i said that i will report to straits times if they silenced me not to say and stay in pss,btohqsg
or like the name of the bus stops,btohqsg
holy shit this was so smart,btohqsg
my parents tried to go down to moe again for me,btohqsg
but i heard the old sch principal had connections with moe itself,btohqsg
ohh ya.. iirc one of the very popular haunted spots was inside a condo,btohqsg
if that was the name of the bus stop you were looking for,btohqsg
but after that even more creepier,btohqsg
i think the condo that you're talking about that still holds the hauntedMatilda Houseup to today  is A Treasure Trove,btohqsg
my parents had zero connections LOL,btohqsg
the only reason why i was able to cope with getting through psle was because of countless support from all the primary schools i went,btohqsg
