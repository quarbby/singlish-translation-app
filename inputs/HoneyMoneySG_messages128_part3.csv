if you dont have AMEX card  can consider getting it. Absolute Cashback not viable.the bonus KF miles via sign-up reward isn't too hard to clock,btohqsg
aM.eX don‚Äôt have AMEX card üòÇP.S. he is in AMEX Plat group too,btohqsg
Yes. It‚Äôs not bad. I do use KFB sometimes when amex got offer too.Managed to get a blue tingkat  and recently some capitavouchers from Amex QR pay. üôÇTheir frequent save to app promo not bad too!,btohqsg
if by end of 12month  only $2000 spending on KF Blue. will AMEX go easy with wavier?,btohqsg
Yes. Just ask nicely from CSO. They can waive. üòá,btohqsg
Apologies but how does it work for hawker food please? Does it allows scan and pay or?,btohqsg
Oh ok thank you. I will have to go read it up. I have been using cash for hawker food,btohqsg
Only works for store with sgqr and having amex logo among the supported payment. My experience for my area is about 30% coverage.,btohqsg
True but is there a site to make comparisons?,btohqsg
Can check out Chris's videos on YouTube.https://youtube.com/@honeymoneysgHe did a few comparison on various saving accounts recently.,btohqsg
it might be too difficult to make a table comparing all the various savings accounts  given they all have different characteristics.I can envision it being even more complicated than the MOH table comparing Shield Plans.,btohqsg
You can check out each bank sites and make your own comparisons,btohqsg
True but theres so many different ones cant remember all of em üòÖ,btohqsg
You‚Äôre right. If one factor in the opportunity cost of that $500 step up  the eir actually drops below 4.6% for ocbc360. In theory  that $500 can earn higher than 0.5% (e.g 2.7%) elsewhere.Also to consider is that the step up mechanism requires a reset at certain intervals (e.g yearly). So 1 mth will not earn that 1.5% which will also reduces the eir. Same reason why tbill hv to be above 3.3% to be feasible for one to use cpf. Ignoring the oppt cost factor above  a 24mth reset interval already also drop the eir below 4.6%. So likely 4.65% is only theoretical.I‚Äôm simply assuming we max $100k base n one can meet all requirements. One probably has to consider many factors to decide which is better. No straight answer one la‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Let's start easy. Do you have salary? Spend on credit card? Any bills to pay? Then people can recommend you a few saving acct to start.,btohqsg
None to the first two bills is just rent,btohqsg
Maribank no frills account here ya go,btohqsg
Hi gurus. Can check when trying to get the overseas spent  do we have to choose the overseas currency when we use our cards? Like in japan  they will give the option to choose sgd or yen,btohqsg
Always choose local currency  jpy in this case. If you choose sgd  they give crappy exchange rate + 1% DCC from the bank.,btohqsg
Btw also I like to ask for citi rewards  do we gain 10x for giro payment for insurance?,btohqsg

Anybody apply for tbill using CPF OA ? Last yield was 3.34% thereabouts.  Still worth applying this round ?,btohqsg
Pair uob lady and crmc depending on what you are spending. If you can hit 1k spend  esp in japan with monkey mcc  uob VS is better.,btohqsg
Consider breakeven yield around 2.9% For CPF OA for 6 months (1 month no interest)https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/articles/nav/investing/investing-in-t-bills,btohqsg

Moomoo does not charge a maintenance or Moomoo fees. But Fullerton do charge a small management fees to keep staff paid and office lights / air con working,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI cross check with t&c for Citi prestige  seems like existing card holder is not eligible for the welcome promotion. As my case  I am currently the main card holder for Citi premier miles.,btohqsg

Doesnt seem right. Can you screenshot the TnC that excludes existing Citi cc holders.,btohqsg
