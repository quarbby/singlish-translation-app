New promo earmark reference balance is 31 dec  earliest earmark date is 29 feb release in late may,btohqsg
What is uob stash eir with the cash bonus?,btohqsg
#uobsavings#earmarkthis should be a useful picture for reference.,btohqsg
Ok I guess not too bad since on par with hsbc Ega. (But this one is liquid can in out anytime),btohqsg
But stash is tricky  for safe sake  i will just not touch the acct at all for the whole period even when interest is credit so as not to trigger the below mab clause,btohqsg
Uob one itself would have gotten 5%. May not be as effective if put in stash with only 4.7 as compared to leaving it within uob one itself.,btohqsg
That is in the case when uob one is already earmark  then stash come into picture,btohqsg
Yeah it is weird so I never dare to touch stash. It’s like ocbc 360. Psudeo fixed depositAnd if hsbc ega gives 4.5%+  I rather go with that.,btohqsg
Ega also not that great  u get 3.5 plus 1 for max 1 month then need to withdraw out the park elsewhere as the 1 percent is on incremental from the previous month,btohqsg
That’s why I use 2 Human uob one and 2 human hsbc Ega,btohqsg
Not all have 2 human bank acct lol,btohqsg
See if easier to find 2 human or juggle uob one and uob stash loh,btohqsg
Comparison date is 31 dec 2023.,btohqsg
In general it is only norm to have 1 human  so we discuss the norm first haha.,btohqsg
wats the EIR of the 4 tiers of the UOB rising dragon?,btohqsg
Thanks... time to put back 100k in now..,btohqsg
I only know about 6.5% eir for $100k tier (assuming $10 31st dec balance).The other amounts will be less.,btohqsg
Best to put in today or 2nd Jan? I heard from a few of u guys said 2nd Jan then put in.,btohqsg
No. Do it on 2nd only. But need to be more than $100k to get $100k mab. Use excel. I think I calculated $103400,btohqsg
the lower tiers always seem not worth..haha,btohqsg
What is the reason for 2nd jan?,btohqsg
think i throw into my CIMB 3.5% more worth..doing calculating now..haha,btohqsg
Hmm I still have not transferred out the funds yet   still in time to be eligible for the promotion?,btohqsg
Can we do it with joint accounts?,btohqsg
U can consider use other uob acct (usually people use uob one and uob stash to rotate) if u forgot to withdraw from uob one then consider uob stash if u have 200k (100 in uob one  100 is stash),btohqsg
No harm transferring in on 1 jan right? Just potentially one less day of interest? Then we only need to transfer 100k not 103400,btohqsg
The main acct holder need to register i think,btohqsg
I don’t advise it.I advise use 2 separate humans all individual accounts.Use joint account only to facilitate the movement of funds so lower chance to trigger bank checks.,btohqsg
still need 103400 to get mab $100k,btohqsg
Uob dont process on public holiday  u see the money inside but the date will show as 2nd jan so u be below 100k mab for the month of jan,btohqsg
Uob will recognise your inward money as 2nd jan only,btohqsg
ys sia..tricky..sometimes also not sure they count the way i do or not? hahadamn! my MAB messed up liao now..haha..either sit 100015 everyday and throw anything out that comes in...or maintain 100 but deposit 465 for 1 day and withdraw on the next day,btohqsg
Just dont withdraw at all for the whole earmark period that is the safest haha,btohqsg
If earmark till may then empty all out  leave zero for jun to prepare for next earmark,btohqsg
ya safest but the MAB rises..haha..then hard to track,btohqsg
Actually one year can do twice right..next window to empty account I supposed is in March?,btohqsg
If no withdraw the mab should auto increase due to interest credit. So just dont touch at all for jan to may  empty out 1 shot like ocbc 360,btohqsg
Can do 4 time a year if got 200k and can rotate between uob one and stash,btohqsg
Yeah I using 2 humans each take part twice per year from my memory.The key takeaway is 6.5% pa each time u take part  else 5% when no earmark. Either way very sweet.,btohqsg
yup.. monitoring via excel..not sure my workings correct anot..haha,btohqsg
hiii can i confirm that scoot & pelago is definitely part of the travel category for UOB Lady's card right?,btohqsg
I always over budget slightly.If need to maintain $100k mab I make my excel hit $100 500 mab for example.,btohqsg
ya..datz why interest credit..must vigilant check..hahahai throw out whatever comes in....on the very day,btohqsg
But with interest rate predicting to go down in later part of 2024  i would say just enjoy the high interest rate while it is there,btohqsg
yours one account? overshot abit no harm....stash MAB must chin chun sia...,btohqsg
Yea I only play uob one account.I didn’t like how stash mechanics work like ocbc 360 so I avoid both,btohqsg
oh ya sia..one account 7.8 sure drop later in 2024 i guess...hais,btohqsg
Stash need to be higher or maintain,btohqsg
i try maintain..if keep on high-ing....scared lost count..haha,btohqsg
So best is dont touch and just wipe out one shot,btohqsg
