Pika World Daily Update: 6 August 2021Indices At Record HighsUS stocks had a full day as they closed at record highs while waiting for the Job‚Äôs report. In addition  the Russell 2000 had a smooth start to climb 1.8%.This is despite the stark warning by Dr Anthony Fauci on the possibility of a new Covid strain that can emerge from the pandemic. The US stocks generally linger at their highs as reopening trades continue to provide floor to the stock market with ongoing US vaccination improvement.The 10-Year Treasury yield moves higher given that investors are back to slight risk-on mode. However  the key lies in today‚Äôs job report that will shed light on the progress of the US economy  and it could be a market mover. Poor reading of below 600K may see the shortfall in full employment as a hinder to Fed‚Äôs movement of tapering.Airlines In the Backdrop of Delta VariantSeveral airlines  including Delta Air Lines and American Airlines  are looking into restoring some of their business route with the view that corporate customers may return this fall even when the Delta variant worry continued to linger. As a result  the business travel expectation is to return to around 40% before the pandemic.Despite some rise in recovery stocks  Pika World has been less active in accumulation on such sector unless the sky becomes less cloudy on the impact of the new variant on the real economy.Western Digital: Keep Getting StrongerThe stock price remains relatively flat despite reporting a stronger than expected result. WDC is one of the vital watchlists in the Pika World list  and the latest result confirms a solid performance. Revenue was up 19% compared to last year and well above the $4.5 billion forecasts. In addition  the non-GAAP profits were impressive at $2.16 per share  easily smash estimates by Wall Street of $1.49 a share and more than double from $1.02 a share a year earlier.Pika World likes its execution and outlook given its impressive release of energy-assisted 18 terabyte drives that cloud customers welcome  which we had discussed as a core business segment that could propel WDC to firmer ground.What‚Äôs on the Menu Today?It is the most important day of the week.At 8.30 pm  we will receive the Nonfarm Payrolls  which we expect to reach 870K compared to 850K in the prior period.At the same time  the Unemployment Rate data will be given  and it should drop to 5.7% from 5.9% in the previous period.It is 6 August  Thursday  8.05 am in Singapore and 8.05 pm in New York. It has been a reasonably good ride for the week  and we hope today will finish with a splendid opening to a long weekend!If you find the content in this group useful  share it with your friends through the link:https://t.me/invest_with_pika_world  as it will help us reach out to a broader audience.,btohqsg
"Yangzijiang Shipbuilding H1 net profit up 39% amid fall in revenue1. YANGZIJIANG Shipbuilding posted a net profit of 1.6 billion yuan (S$339.6 million) in the first half  up 39 per cent from the same period the year before  despite a drop in vessel sales and trading revenue.2. In the first half of 2021  the group set a record number of new orders for 112 new vessels  with a total contract value of US$ 6.67 billion. This contributed to its ""unparalleled outstanding order book"" of US$8.7 billion for 167 vessels  said Yanzijiang on Thursday.3. In 2021  he noted  the group secured its first batch of 40 000 cubic meter LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) vessels and LNG (liquefied natural gas) dual-fuel 7 000 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent unit) containerships. Both of these are ""unprecedented"" in the group's ship-building history  he said.Click here for details.T&Cs apply",btohqsg
