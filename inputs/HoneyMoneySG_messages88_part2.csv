Itâ€™s a low risk investment and the money you put inside will be invested in MAS bills and bonds. Depending on which fund you choose youâ€™ll get daily interest.,btohqsg
Oh  I also donâ€™t see this,btohqsg
Money market funds are accumulating funds. Think of it that their dividends are invested back to itself  so no dividends are issued. But the fund price just keeps going up (almost always).,btohqsg
Thanks all for the input  so  the interest is putting back to the fund automatically. We only have capital gain when I sell my fund ( if price go down I lost) correct?,btohqsg

to pay for insurance is no. But u can go through 3rd party like Cardup to pay for it and earn the rebates whether it is cashback or miles,btohqsg
no... the only way is to transfer money into ur trust bank account and pay via there,btohqsg

Thanks.Not even like using POSB everyday card to earn cashback?For a onetime car insurance payment?,btohqsg
Do you need to enable this,btohqsg
not sure abt that but u hv to read the t&c for it,btohqsg
Credit card normally will exclude insurance  hospital and government bills etc for rewards and cashback. Exception will be Standard Chartered prudential card where it specifically stated in t&c,btohqsg
Based on tnc  theoretically can work. But no one bothered to try because the interest is trash.,btohqsg
What you can do is open a DBS MyAccount (no fall below fee) then link that to DBS PayLah. Link your GPay to DBS PayLah. Transfer your funds to DBS MyAccount then use GPay to pay PayNow QR.,btohqsg

It went back to CPF-OA or CPF-IA?,btohqsg
Strange.. maybe takes time to process the actual deposit to your CPF-IS? ðŸ¤”Assuming your CPF-OA is still above 20k?,btohqsg
The problem is that the funds are stuck in cpfia and transferring back to cpf oa requires processing delay. And the system does not allow me to apply directly with cpfia funds. If S anyone has managed to do so please share.,btohqsg
Hi  question on CPF.1. Can we still transfer OA to SA if SA already hit FRS? (below 55).2. Can we withdraw the transfer amount after 55 yo?,btohqsg
1. No2. No  but it just means itâ€™ll form part of RA first and once BRS/FRS is reached the mandatory contributions can be withdrawn,btohqsg
To add on to Ed's point for no.2  you can look up something called CPF Shielding.You can shield your SA monies from being used to form your RA. This basically gives you the flexibility to keep your SA monies to earn 4.08% and withdraw it anytime if you have hit FRS in RA.,btohqsg
