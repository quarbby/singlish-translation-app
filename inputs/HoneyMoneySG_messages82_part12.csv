So it seems that citipm is better?,btohqsg
Minimum spending for the interest üôèüèº,btohqsg
Depends on which platform u looking at  else why not pick up the UOB Lady's card  categories changable once every quarter from what i understand,btohqsg
Okay  so UOB lady's card doesn't have minimum spend?,btohqsg
"Up to your personal valuation.. (or rather  what's your ""available cards"")",btohqsg
Currently I don't have any credit card,btohqsg
If I apply for a credit card with basic eligibility salary what will be the credit amount in the card?,btohqsg
"Are you looking at one for any use case (like makan  cinema  shopping etc.)   or one with specific use case (like ""travel"" which u mentioned)",btohqsg
How about for lounge access I can get citipm and for earning miles I can get citirmc,btohqsg
The one that covers all the category you've mentioned including travel bookings too to earn miles,btohqsg
If u mean Citi PremierMiles card  Citibank excludes travel related category,btohqsg
I suggest you go read up yourself on these cards and understand how the cards work  you will benefit from it.,btohqsg
Hi experts.May I check if anyone use UOB lady + amaze on Jeju air? Got 6 miles,btohqsg
Hi  questions have been answered. Can scroll up and find the answers.,btohqsg
Make sure you pay all balances on time and inFULL. No minimum amount  no late payment.,btohqsg
You need to put 100k on top of what you had on 30 Dec le.,btohqsg
Yagnaif you can't do it  then you're not a credit card person  and you should reduce your limits to just $500 just to clock the spending for UOB One account..,btohqsg
OK  but I can maintain that,btohqsg
Yes. Must keep it 100k above your end of day of 30 Dec  avoid withdrawals.,btohqsg
Anyway first time CC user credit limit won't be very high  especially if they see 30k annual income.. when I first started using CC  DBS approved me for 8k only  iirc.,btohqsg
Ohh  thank you so much for that information...,btohqsg
Citipm and citirmc  will do for me I guess... The citirmc points can be converted into miles right?,btohqsg
Where can I spend using both the credit card?,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think this is right. All citibank cards should have the same transfer partners.,btohqsg
oh my apologies. you are right. let me  delete the text üòÖ,btohqsg
Hi sifus  I have UOB Visa Signature and Prvi Miles Mastercard. I wanted to ask buy package (more than $1000) in Klook but thinking which card should I use?- If I use Visa Signature and I change the currency to other than SGD in Klook  do i still get the points and is it worthy?,btohqsg

Hi. Anyone actively converting their UOB Priv Miles/UOB One Card Uni$ to Krisflyer miles?I just got started on this journey. Am looking out for guides tips. TIA!,btohqsg
Hi all  may I check for uob one account $500 spending  can insurance be included to get the bonus interest ?,btohqsg
Yes can clock for spending for UOB One account. No cannot clock as eligible spending for any UOB CC.,btohqsg
ok. so technically if i use uob ladies card together with my uob account  i can charge insurance onto that card and still get the bonus interest?Just that i wont get any miles right?,btohqsg
So I‚Äôve been charging all my bills  spend on the UOB PRVI miles card. I want to accumulate miles to redeem flight tix (now only at a miniscule 4k UNI$).Only recently I downloaded the Kris+ app. Basically it‚Äôs a booster for your miles if you pay thru Kris+ app.was wondering if you:(1) diligently convert the Uni$ into Krisflyer miles?(2) don‚Äôt convert until it hits 10 000 blocks to make it worthwhile.I note that Krisflyer miles has like a 6 months validity from date of conversion.,btohqsg
2. Always wait till you actually need to spend the miles  or the miles are going to expire  before converting. UNI$ have 2 years validity within UOB  and then once you transfer to Krisflyer another 3 years validity. So plenty of time to accumulate for one big flight redemption and reduce the transfer fees paid,btohqsg
I convert a huge chunk (by end of 2 years) at one go to make the conversion fee worth it.KF miles have 3 years validity  not 6 months.add on: PRVI miles card is not the best card to earn miles  it‚Äôs too slow. you should look into other UOB cards to speed up the earning. I suggest Preferred platinum visa  visa signature and uob lady‚Äôs card.,btohqsg
note that if u redeem kf miles via kris+ there is 15% haircut in the miles received,btohqsg

May I know where can I see the cash rebate from uob evol credit card?,btohqsg
Privi is 1.4mpd‚Ä¶ why not use other cards like Uob PPV or VS?,btohqsg
It will appear in your statement in the next statement monthhttps://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/uob-evol-terms-and-conditions.pdf,btohqsg

Does anyone know if ocbc infinity card awards cashback for public transport?,btohqsg
If you're referring to when the cashback appears in your statement then you'll see it in the end of next statement month.If you're referring to current statement month then you can use excel to calculate it.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if ShopBack paylater is considered qualifying spend for UOB EVOL?,btohqsg
Generally ShopBack purchases can be considered ‚Äúonline‚Äù payments right? I don‚Äôt think there is anything stated with regards to the paylater option since it‚Äôs not really an instalment option offered by the bank,btohqsg
I think if im not wrong it's considered as online. But I think someone said before instead of waiting it to count down and pay outManually trigger it and it's considered online,btohqsg
