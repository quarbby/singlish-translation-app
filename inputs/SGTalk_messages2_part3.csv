Can see that you don't know the history of Hardwarezone.

Lol you know what a laughing joke you are. Rather than trying to understand the issue or even attempting to discuss it - you'd much rather engage in personal attacks!,btohqsg
You just keep proving to everyone what a small mind you truly are,btohqsg
Can you see that you don't know your own history - of how you truly have no intellectual capacity to discuss any issues lol,btohqsg
I don't know because I did not apply  I don't need it. I still have job. But is it useless to complain in a forum and do nothing about it  Can appeal to MP also  did they? Some appeal got accepted.https://www.facebook.com/BaeyYamKeng/posts/3455747414452940,btohqsg
Lol finally we know why you don't care. It doesn't affect you. Its ok. Understand. But please don't be little others like me who are jobless,btohqsg
Firstly are they really telling the truth  we will never know. did they meet the criteria  implementation is by strict criteria.Not stating which criteria they fail that leads them to not receiving more benefits. They may have more than one property  Their household income maybe more than the criteria. Some even resign on their own  that is their own fault. It is not I don't care.From forum:This is my rejected sms(MSF): (date and time of application xxxx)Support Grant application was unsuccessful as you did not meet one or more of the eligibility criteria.How to appeal like this? I only have one screenshot email and one whatsapp that my performance not up to standard. After that I was asked to resign  Everyday got scolded until can’t take it. If I appeal will they call the ex company? Later those ex colleagues laugh at meCOVID-19 Support Grant:• Singapore Citizens or PRs aged 16 years and above• Unemployed due to retrenchment/contract termination as a result of COVID-19 (after 23 Jan 2020)• Involuntary NPL for a period of at least 3 consecutive months (e.g. Mar - May 2020  May - Jul 2020)• Experiencing reduced monthly salary of at least 30% for a period of at least 3 consecutive months (e.g. Mar - May 2020  May - Jul 2020)• Prior gross monthly household income of ≤$10 000  or monthly per capita income of ≤$3 100• Live in a property with annual value of ≤$21 000• Not on ComCare assistance• Not on Self-Employed Persons Income Relief Scheme (SIRS)• Not a Full-time National Servicemen (NSF) or intern• Previously employed as full-time/part-time permanent or contract staff• Agree to actively participate in job search or attend a training programme under Workforce Singapore (WSG) or the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i),btohqsg

the Job Support Scheme grant is give to business. that's why some people (esp unemployed) are not happy because they are not the direct beneficiary of it. You have to look at it from a macro standpoint vs an individual standpoint.,btohqsg
Later end up like Obama administration. They bail out big businesses and banks  then those executives went to buy yacht ⛵.The US government need to spy on them and repossess in the middle of the night,btohqsg
5  I don't know. Because I don't have 5 but got it.Only HDB households are eligible for the GST Voucher – U-Save. To receive the GST Voucher – U-Save  your household has to fulfil the following conditions:If you own and live in your HDB flat  there must be at least one Singapore citizen owner or occupier in the flat; orIf you partially rent out the HDB flat that you own and live in  there must be at least one Singapore citizen owner or occupier in the flat; orIf you rent an entire flat  there must be at least one Singapore citizen tenant;ANDImmediate family members living in the same flat must not own or have any interest in more than one property.The eligibility criteria of the GST Voucher – U-Save Special Payment is the same as the above. To be eligible for the further GST Voucher U-Save rebate for larger households  households must have five or more household members. Household members refer to individuals living at the same residence (as reflected on their NRICs)  and must be related by blood  marriage or legal adoption. Domestic helpers  tenants who are unrelated  god-parents/siblings/children  and friends are not considered as household members.,btohqsg

hi just to inquire can Muslim eat rich and good cake ma.tia,btohqsg
JudyUnknown to me as Muslims are able to eat Rich and Good Cake as are they being halal certified??,btohqsg
but pastries usually no pork no lard that's y wonder if they do consume from this brand,btohqsg
We've yet to receive any Halal applications from Rich & Good Cake Shop hence it is not Muis Halal certified.Jan 17  2014,btohqsg
Judyhttps://www.halaltag.com/for your information.  It may be correct or wrong as I know the website is okay for me.,btohqsg
Hihi Judy!Preferably with Halal certified  because some individuals are very cautious when it comes to edibles being halal certified though there's no pork or lard.,btohqsg
But pastries uses gelatin which may be of pork or other animal origins which muslims consider as not halal,btohqsg
Are they in a midst of Cert or no since the source provide was from Jan 2014,btohqsg
Means if earn more get less?,btohqsg
