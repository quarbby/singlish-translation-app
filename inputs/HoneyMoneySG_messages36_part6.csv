It depends on the shop. Eg best Denki has a sign at their cashier counter informing what bank and the installment period. And min spend amt.,btohqsg
Thinking to use it to make payment for insurance,btohqsg
what is this bonus cashback means,btohqsg
HSBC revolution or Citibank Reward MasterCard Better?,btohqsg
It really depends . Both are very similar. Both have same limit,btohqsg
But HSBC revolution has less restriction,btohqsg
Both card cover dining & retail(Citi rewards need use amaze). Both card cover online retail .Area where HSBC does better : travel relatedAreas Citi does better : utility bills etc,btohqsg
Which card better depends on what you are using the card for.,btohqsg
Depends on merchant like court   best denki etc. By opting for installment  likely you wouldn't earn miles or cashback.,btohqsg
HSBC revolution bonus point system comes after one month. While Citi is awards the moment payment confirm . Easier to keep track .,btohqsg
Correct.If citi reward is primary card  you will use citi for everything  then use HSBC as secondary for travel.If HSBC is your primary card  you going to use it for everything  but citi reward only when you doing online transaction in foreign currency or when spending overseas.,btohqsg
Insurance policy none can do 12 months 0%. Most is with some fee or admin fee,btohqsg
