u charge 3k on a prius,btohqsg
PPL WILL STILL DRIVE THE FKIN PRIUS,btohqsg
3k over 1 year is $250 monthly,btohqsg
He clearly has a prejudice against performance car owners,btohqsg
They think parking too cheap  they rather pay fee evading fine. Contribute to society,btohqsg
"Because you're adding in irrational points and just trying to twist the narrative when a simple principle of ""drive less=road tax lower"" is in front of you",btohqsg
"But you want to make it about ""sports car owners  green plan  high emissions  someone not paying for parking""",btohqsg
I think i shall buy a alpine,btohqsg
Small cc small car  enough to smoke most big cc cars,btohqsg
The higher road tax paid by those who drive more will cover it up.....,btohqsg
Be it small engine  big engine  no engine  etc.,btohqsg
u know whats the best solution,btohqsg
May i ask mr tio  do u drive or own a car?,btohqsg
"No  ""tax the rich  make cars free for the rest  free petrol  free everything""",btohqsg
price go up  ppl will complain until sibei dulanzzz,btohqsg
Read the room. Someone else should die,btohqsg
wait so whats the problem w big cc?,btohqsg
EITHER IM A RETARD OR SOMEONE ISNT MAKING SENSE,btohqsg
yes used to be a geog student  what about ut,btohqsg
Basically the discussion is revisions to the coe/road tax structure,btohqsg
i tell you how to solve congestion  you ready?,btohqsg
But someone decided to throw a spanner,btohqsg
ERP = Mileage. Simple. Everybody pay a fair share. Road Tax remain the same. Big CC boys pay big road tax  small CC boys pay little road tax.,btohqsg
Let ERP cover the mileage  Road tax cover emissions,btohqsg
They should be allowed to have nice things just because they are rich,btohqsg
thats why we have Road Tax,btohqsg
Ok lah everyone buy copen 660cc settle already,btohqsg
Okay so let me tell you the problem with this,btohqsg
No must ban  why they make so big cc in the first place,btohqsg
we all assume big CC = alot of emissions hor,btohqsg
Volvo have 2.0L cars but i believe they have one of the highest emissions,btohqsg
The whole point is  a Ferrari that drives 15k km in 10 years vs Vios that drives 400k km,btohqsg
higher than your 296GTB  higher than any hybrid sportscar,btohqsg
green earth means we all die bro  plants civilisation take over us,btohqsg
WHY ALOT OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS NOWADAYS,btohqsg
Now if you charge based on usage  I assure you  vios will pay way more than the Ferrari would've paid in 10 years,btohqsg
And the Ferrari is still paying for the 15k km....,btohqsg
I think precisely because the rich are hogging the resource by ‚Äòparking‚Äô,btohqsg
plants v zombie irl  pea shooter time,btohqsg
And it's not a fixed cost per km,btohqsg
A component of emissions will still likely be involved,btohqsg
So now we have your problem,btohqsg
so you think the rich are preventing the normal ppl from buying regular car isit?,btohqsg
But you also don't want to be the vios and pay more,btohqsg
"And just put everything on the ""rich""",btohqsg
So you really just want this  got it,btohqsg
Ok tomorrow i email in  whats your email? I cc you,btohqsg
Not just the rich but also the phv companies. Else why would they think it is a viable business to hog,btohqsg
Aiya might as well. Need to appease the green man here,btohqsg
If you think this way  this is from your point of view  but what about from the government POV. You buy the car  you park the car. Easy revenue bro. You not only pay the High COE ARF Road Tax  you contribute to boosting the COE price,btohqsg
they would rather let you register 5 ferrari than 5 avante,btohqsg
But they park in their very nice landed houses which they paid for? Or pay for parking when they drive out their 1/10 cars just like the rest of us pay for parking?,btohqsg
Not a problem if they park in their own private property. I have not seen anyone or know anyone who has more than 3 cars parking on public road or public places,btohqsg
I agreed on the rights to tax on usage. More you use more you pay. Same idea as housing. Where got empty houses in little red dot?,btohqsg
They might just pay more by valeting too  therefore creating jobs,btohqsg
Its not about rich or poor here  its about usage.,btohqsg
Put in frankly  the ‚Äúpoor‚Äù who are driving  the government dont care about you,btohqsg
makes them even happier when you are angry and cannot afford,btohqsg
Just jow u say big difference  now u say little difference  make up ypur mind bro  im helping u here,btohqsg
And even if they do  they pay for parking......,btohqsg
I jusr wanna see everyone here happy,btohqsg
i just wanna wave my log card in malaysian face  and be happy that my depre is higher,btohqsg
Yep  so now we alr punnish those w high emissions right?,btohqsg
Just too many red and sore eye ppl around..,btohqsg
Car lite also means those rich should not hog the space right? üòÖ,btohqsg
Now how we punish those that drive alot?,btohqsg
Which is exactly what we are saying,btohqsg
No  car lite means more people use public transport,btohqsg
Yes  and give a free car to everyone who cant afford also,btohqsg
Then make people less desire on having cars right?,btohqsg
If the rich use 5 cars  he make 4 other families use bus and train,btohqsg
If they can afford it  why can't they buy? COE is the result of car lite and it has shot up so much yet people pay to buy the good. Like luxury handbag  gets expensive  isn't sustainable  yet people buy.Luxury goods not necessity.....,btohqsg
u have to understand  the government dont give a shit about whether you have a car anot  they only want to reduce car on the roads,btohqsg
they dont care the rich hog  only those tht cannot afford care (no offence),btohqsg
I like to take examples of japan. Almost every household have a car but they choose not to drive to work. So the reasons are obvious,btohqsg
Ok  each poor person get their own mrt,btohqsg
You need to understand and make up your mind. You can't say car lite then also say car too expensive,btohqsg
not too familiar  could you enlighten me please?,btohqsg
In SG if u are poor the gov still help u.. in fact is the sandwiched class which are suffering more than the poor..,btohqsg
Why? Big engine doesn't mean high emissions. Measure exact emissions instead?,btohqsg
Erm  most people in shenton way dont drive to work too.,btohqsg
so you lanlan have to workhard and get out of there lor,btohqsg
But not all own a car too right?,btohqsg
I also don‚Äôt drive to work and I got car,btohqsg
Ya because u are neither up or down,btohqsg
Yes people have less desire  but there's still people who can afford them  why stop them from buying something they can afford  unless you're proposing a C0MMUN15T society here?,btohqsg
Why not? How do u know the people in japan own a car?,btohqsg
bobian one la  thats why if u like driving cars  move out of SG. if not  buy shitboxes like imran do,btohqsg
If I say in my household I own 3-cars but we don‚Äôt use them to go work. So they are literally hogging just because I can afford,btohqsg
just fall into below category let the rich ppl do the work for you üòàüòà,btohqsg
The whole conversation is proposing a change sir. Please get with the program.....,btohqsg
i propose an increase in road tax and coe  what do you think,btohqsg
Parking space and the others to own a means of transport that they can have a better chance of a better life?,btohqsg
What's the issue with that  someday you will be outbid by someone else who can afford them and that's how life works. We live in a capitalist world  not a communist one.....,btohqsg
Or should we implement the old coe system,btohqsg
Coe should have additional stamp duty component if registered in same household address,btohqsg
Emissions over engine size.... There's 2.4s that have higher emissions than 4.0s now,btohqsg
So you want car lite and also want everyone to own a car. Nice....,btohqsg
i can rent a house for $1k and then reg the car there  no add stamp duty,btohqsg
Precisely too much money coming in from affluent channels that local citizens cannot control,btohqsg
I pick pap. No one wanna shake the grounds too hard,btohqsg
the big boss towkay government dont care,btohqsg
Ok and what if a household is multi generational and has various working adults with their own needs and they can all afford a car? They would still pay for it and move on  not helping your agenda still,btohqsg
our minister go temple run thru hdb block one leh,btohqsg
Well if gov care to control housing prices  there must be a reason,btohqsg
Housing is different  cars are luxury,btohqsg
Who say cannot? Work harder and everything is possible (harsh truth of life),btohqsg
Nope  only engine size is as of now  and power figure for EVs,btohqsg
The rich hog the houses  poor no where to stay. Rich hog the cars  poor take mrt bro,btohqsg
The additional charges will help gov budget to help middle and lower income group.,btohqsg
Emissions themselves are a very small component,btohqsg
What if the rich hog the buses,btohqsg
Like that  those people who got money and stay in gcb should be punished,btohqsg
Consumption goes up in that case  rich still get richer and still have more cars,btohqsg
Depriving others living space and parking space,btohqsg
i agree‚Ä¶ blame their ahgong ahma for inheriting the land,btohqsg
Just that you're inflating values of everything in the process,btohqsg
Ya. I keep hearing the old gen saying the young gen will sleep in shoeboxes blah blah blah until gov have to step in,btohqsg
They drive up prices like the coe  until the poor cant afford house to stay,btohqsg
Housing is a necessity  having a car isn't,btohqsg
And the happiest thing ever happen was no inheritance tax. üòÖ,btohqsg
My fat fingers are so tired,btohqsg
on top sometimes go smoke come out one,btohqsg
Ask those middle income people. ü§û,btohqsg
Next thing they say  rich got more space so hog more air  we no air to breathe,btohqsg
I shall go for a drive  burn some fuel and rubber,btohqsg
1800-LTA   i found the culprit for the tire marks otr,btohqsg
I also like to burn. Never believe in the ev agenda,btohqsg
Separate topic but I feel we may be on the same side of this one,btohqsg
"You rich kor kor can drive to destress  I can only drink coffee ""MUST TAX YOU MORE""",btohqsg
The decathlon rubber/seah im rubber/ecp rubber?,btohqsg
Cause it is zero impact to them. Do they care coe prices goes up when they can already pay for additional supercars? Make them pay more better lah.,btohqsg
Hahaha dont say so loud  later i TIO aim,btohqsg
Idk about that  im responsible for the bicycle tyre marks at the pcn,btohqsg
Making them pay more doesnt solve anything,btohqsg
Not trying to be idealistic that it will solve all problems with car ownerships or wealth inequality,btohqsg
Every time I pass by Gombak camp  I already green eye liao. üòÇ,btohqsg
rich get richer is a poor analogy guys‚Ä¶ most of the time when it comes to cars  everybody gets poorer‚Ä¶,btohqsg
"Yes you make them pay more>Government gets more>Assume they pass all of that down to the lower sections of the economy>They now spend more>Demand increases>Assume supply increases at constant rate as current market>All you do is inflate prices for the whole market which the rich can afford either way  the poor can now afford with added subsidies provided  your ""middle income"" dies again",btohqsg
This cycle is only broken when you get enough money from the rich to pay both the lower and middle sections of the economy off to level the playing field for them and at that point  are you really in a capitalistic economy or just a socialist one with no parity and free benefits for all no matter what,btohqsg
quota the same how supply increase,btohqsg
Lol. So we are punishing those who had the ability to make something out of their lives  and reward those who dont contribute to society,btohqsg
very simple DD curve shift up when u give out inventive,btohqsg
Only middle households keep increasing. üòÖ,btohqsg
subisidise will never come unless its EV,btohqsg
this is to be expected when you have temple run and shaolin master ministers,btohqsg
Then no way to fulfill everyone as in every household eh,btohqsg
Only to a certain point if the good is under supplied,btohqsg
There will always be some section that will suffer,btohqsg
And unfortunately because of the way society works,btohqsg
it has been a very fufilling conversation with you today  glad that we all came to an agreement,btohqsg
Ya. the rich get to hog resources,btohqsg
Being average is the new normal,btohqsg
Because we boost up our lower sections by giving them grants and subsidies and the higher end makes money off their increased spending,btohqsg
I would say  use resources they have earned,btohqsg
Because not all rich have earned them,btohqsg
Wa la wa la wa la,btohqsg
The additional incremental component on coe prices for those having to own more than one car,btohqsg
no la but there is honestly not much that can be done,btohqsg
but this will just cos the rich ppl to hog more,btohqsg
Lets face it  this conversation is no longer about cars,btohqsg
COE 100k nia  their cars 700-800k,btohqsg
I agree  thank you Mr PCC for being open minded and willing to listen to the logic,btohqsg
1 month add 1k to the installment lor,btohqsg
they dont care one la HAHA,btohqsg
Did someone mention on removing cat b?,btohqsg
Car should just be a flat tier.,btohqsg
I would say it's always been the same  just that we see the struggles and the lavishness more by way of increasing content and social media access,btohqsg
We are all just depresso  I need an espresso,btohqsg
Cat B is for the regular cars sir‚Ä¶,btohqsg
u put all in 1 cat  all the coe gonna go up like siao bro,btohqsg
There is not much difference when the industry is manipulating the quota,btohqsg
And introducing separate COE for phv,btohqsg
A Cat B+ or something could be introduced for engines over 3000cc or 4000cc,btohqsg
Why the need to make cat b coe more affordable for the rich?,btohqsg
This might help stabilise the prices for Cat B buyers more,btohqsg
One tier  and if own more than one car  then he pay extra 50% on that coe,btohqsg
But not too much of a difference,btohqsg
If this is the 3rd car  coe will be 200%. Huat ah.,btohqsg
Just like property  they can put the car under other people names,btohqsg
Just that now as a 2.0 golf buyer  your bid is not up against a 6.75 cullinan buyer lol,btohqsg
200% is 200k coe. Only 10% more on top of a car that cost 2mil,btohqsg
Cat b isn't more affordable for the rich though?,btohqsg
In fact  cat Bs whole existence is to make cars over 1600cc more expensive,btohqsg
And only 4% on top of a bugatti  and it cant even be driven here,btohqsg
Well same for property lor. Until gov step in to close the loophole that rich uses,btohqsg
Better examples for the same price range that can be driver here,btohqsg
Why do you think lawyers and personal accountants make money,btohqsg
Lol. So they can get more cars?,btohqsg
Fyi  a alfa giulia gtam which cost 1mil to be on the road  1 of the buyer bought without registering. So he only paid 200+k. Coe 1 mil also doesnt natter to him,btohqsg
Because they find loopholes  ways to reduce tax payments  using SPVs etc.,btohqsg
How are they related to property?,btohqsg
So that they don‚Äôt get tax additional mah. ü§£,btohqsg
The govt reduced the ltv to 75%  but guess what  the EC still sold like hot cakes  despite msr is only 30%,btohqsg
When it comes to tax  it‚Äôs all up to gov and those behind it to drive.,btohqsg
Gst increase is a fair universal for all as example,btohqsg
Companies pay 30% absd for residential property,btohqsg
So what loophole u talking about,btohqsg
is one of your cars a X6M,btohqsg
i bet he uses bald tourador  rydanz and linglong  tyres for all 3,btohqsg
2 of the plates look the same too,btohqsg
You have my envy that the system works for you.,btohqsg
I want to get rich too,btohqsg
What loophole is there for property,btohqsg
How do I buy cheaper property,btohqsg
And prosper like hong Kong landlord,btohqsg
Oh so how the rich get richer? Or buy more properties?,btohqsg
If they can afford first before thinking of hogging car resources. Same as parking lots issues. No parking lot  cannot buy car like in some countries,btohqsg
Yeah at least we have limit on number of cars,btohqsg
I wanna know what is the loophole here,btohqsg
And can always find decently priced parking wherver we go,btohqsg
And season parking is not exorbitantly expensive,btohqsg
Office building is a different case,btohqsg
Cue finbros taking mrt cause 1k season parking,btohqsg
Property loopholes? Search on the trust thingy lor,btohqsg
Doesnt look like a loophole to me,btohqsg
Parking is cheap in singapore lah. Only the rich are wiling to gamble and then say they can afford to pay the fines.,btohqsg
Sorry I wasn‚Äôt referring to companies in general. Sorry for my use of words. It was on living trust for property to avoid any absd,btohqsg
Even so each child can only hold 1 property  and must be paid in full,btohqsg
And that if one household with all the eligible adults bidding for coe  then sure defeat the quota thingy,btohqsg
Not when it was in beneficial terms,btohqsg
Yes  so no matter what  the rich can find ways to own the cars,btohqsg
Exactly. So must make them pay more,btohqsg
How if they can avoid by putting in other names our housesholds?,btohqsg
Property bought under trust cannot be conditional,btohqsg
So living in hdb but with 3 cars parking in hdb parking lots  does that sound right to begin with? üòÖ,btohqsg
That means they already paying more taxes than ever. üòÖ,btohqsg
Of course it doesnt  but how many are doing that,btohqsg
Oh my. It‚Äôs time to üí§.,btohqsg
And each person required the car for a different purpose  and each pays  e.g. 100k coe,btohqsg
Ok sure. This is going nowhere anyway,btohqsg
How to be of different purpose when it is hogging,btohqsg
The argument that not all are utilised thus do not commit the same carbon pollutants in total  means one can hog the carbon credits right?,btohqsg
Not hogging if not using  provided parked in private property,btohqsg
Private property is not hdb lor.,btohqsg
U can have a 6.0L car or 60L  if u dont use it  u emit less than a 1.0L car travelling 10k a year,btohqsg
Those who can afford private property with means to park more than one car  by all means.,btohqsg
Yup. Pay more is my context for additional luxury,btohqsg
One wife not enough must find mistresses and just pay niah,btohqsg
U guys can be best friends,btohqsg
But at least those mistresses are paid. üòÖ,btohqsg
Stuck around more than me as well this time,btohqsg
Cant stand it when facts are twisted people say things out of hearsay,btohqsg
Still using some brain power to check soemthing,btohqsg
I hope it's not how fast you can empty your tank of fuel,btohqsg
Hahahaha its not. But it should be equally satisfying,btohqsg
Well in that case  I wish you luck with whatever you're doing,btohqsg
As long as it isn't insanely illegal or a violation of human rights,btohqsg
Loads and loads. But in essence  it was discussion of revising the coe and road tax system  which digressed to economics  supply and demand  and the rich and poor gap,btohqsg
i was playing game w fellow ur sgcm members üòõ,btohqsg
i drive singapore one round alr u still here ü§≠ü§≠,btohqsg
must appreciate our cars  most people here kp abt price to expensive can actually afford it,btohqsg
so what if people pay more lol  you can afford it can liao  let those that cannot afford voice to the mp or ministers,btohqsg
but i have full faith in my belief that cars will be increasingly unattainble no matter how many ppl complain,btohqsg
If yall got dream car but cannot buy  there is always#FULLLOANSQUADRON,btohqsg
funny how people worry about rich and poor gap‚Ä¶ cars are a luxury not a neccessity.Like if you cannot afford to purchase and maintain then dont buy car laüòÖüòÖIts not like ppl live 50km from the nearest supermarket where ppl actually need carsüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
and to the people that say rich people hog cars  the government is very happy that they do just that :),btohqsg
government revenue from 1 new ferrari  i think 20 toyota vios also cannot cover,btohqsg
U fast mah hahahaha. My fat fingers type slow,btohqsg
never include road tax gst etc,btohqsg
just calculated actual number  1 : 35,btohqsg
Im a law abiding citizen  i dont want to lose my license. Later my car park at home ppl say i hogging üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
No ody complains about volvos la,btohqsg
sadly singaporeans buy for badge a lot,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why ws business for w204 komp and rocco so good,btohqsg
üòÇüòÇüòÇ scirocco is mainly gb issues no..? Sigh its a nice car but maintenance wise its just too much alr,btohqsg
Clarify that you're referring to arf here  later people bring up road tax argument again,btohqsg
It isn't bad if you find a unit that's well maintained and hasn't been abused and modded using taobao turbo etc.,btohqsg
Tat time I tried to ask abit a unit during the cars@Expo  kena diao by the salesman :),btohqsg
Yes. And on policies  we should keep in mind policies are most impactful when they are addressed towards the right segment which in this case ismajority of population.,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/N0alJHLOxz0a good watch. Not meant to diss any car one owns or going to buy (quite a number of them are not in SIN anyway) but key point to understand potential weak points in one‚Äôs car so that one can watch out for early signs or better yet carry out preventive maintenance to improve reliability. üòäüòä,btohqsg
And a very good morning to all at SGCM. TGIF!!Serene!,btohqsg
Accidents do happen lah sir. Just that some more than others ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Just hopefully not a big repair bill to the hirer and there‚Äôs adequate insurance in place.,btohqsg
Juuuust only they release this car,btohqsg
Got insurance coverage doesn‚Äôt matter expensive or cheap cars.,btohqsg
tht all the blue sg ppl cannot drive,btohqsg
this car how old only sia,btohqsg
3 months time cfm no blue sg on the road liao,btohqsg
Cheap. I thought $5000 at least for such rental cars,btohqsg
And the car insurance premium in general won‚Äôt be lower. Unless one take risks only to cover 3rd parties.,btohqsg
They should up the lessee premiums or deposit requirements (or both) if they look at their accident stats because it does present a corporate risk.  3rd party risks only would be diseastrous,btohqsg
Unless there is something else they‚Äôre after which is not per norm of leasing business.,btohqsg
Opportunity cost aplenty. Just how perceptive one is with any business.,btohqsg
The pininfarina bolero was a 4000+4000 excess,btohqsg

well if the bad drivers keep renting and keep  getting into accidents  it'll only justify this business model,btohqsg
4k own damage and 4k 3rd party,btohqsg
Especially with their history of over claiming and also claiming against drivers who didn't do anything and got damaged cars anyway,btohqsg

Two weeks ago Tesla asked me to test drive Tesla 3 performance. Made in Shanghai. Car is damn solid. No sign of squeeks and all panel gaps good. Car feels sporty and balanced. High coe deters buying.,btohqsg
Cannot do more than 100kmh. But acceleration o can feel already impressive,btohqsg
If you ever walk in to their dealer  they will ask you to fill out their interest form instantly,btohqsg
My heart says yes but my wallet says no,btohqsg
I walked past and the salesman just asked me if I‚Äôd like to test drive. I said yes,btohqsg
They got young university graduates working as salesmen,btohqsg
Yupp because most graduates apply for Tesla Singapore office roles,btohqsg
And have to start out with training at the dealer,btohqsg
Whoever says quality bad is totally untrue. It‚Äôs really built solid,btohqsg
The Shanghai units have been getting better,btohqsg

70mai a800s is very good value,btohqsg
Thanks. I don't will need 4K. I'm looking at A500s (pro plus) or M500  one with screen and SD card  the other no screen build in memory. Not sure which one is more practical .,btohqsg
Screen is used for reviewing footage on the cam itself  and you can easily tell if the cam spoil I guess,btohqsg
No screen looks smaller and cleaner,btohqsg
thanks. just a stupid question  can i simply unplug my current dash cam and plug the new one to the same cable? (so that I don't have to do the wiring),btohqsg

How to answer this question sir,btohqsg
We need what car you drive....,btohqsg

Honda fit 2009   I bought 3 months ago then servicing due. Today my engine just cut off due to faulty acutator,btohqsg
Like I am still 4000km away from  servicing as indicated but because of the whole car today no electricity  so I had to go earlier,btohqsg
Since it's a Honda fit which is pretty common  you can look for an sgcm guide for recommended workshops in your area,btohqsg
