Citi rewards + amaze suits your spending,btohqsg
Amaze + Citi Rewards. No min spend  cap at $1000 per statement month. Points can be converted to statement credits at 2.27% if not 4 mpd. Lower FX of 2% vs 3.25-3.5% of bank CC.,btohqsg
Thanks for answering! If I would like to get another cash back card besides citi rewards  is it a wise choice to go for SC smart (since no min spend)? Use it for fast food restaurants and public transport to earn miles + cash back,btohqsg
Can use for like 4 months before it becomes unusable,btohqsg
May I know what do you mean use it for 4 months?,btohqsg
It introduces min spend of 800$/monthafter 31 Mar 2025.https://t.me/HMSGHive/2081,btohqsg
Not a good news to hear,btohqsg

Hi  can l check if l use maybank fnf card to pay an AXS bill of $300 that is out of the 5 catalogues then another $500 within the 5 chosen catalogues. Will that consider $800 spends and qualify for the 8% cashback?,btohqsg
By tnc axs is excluded transaction so should not count. But u can try $10 axs and see if tracker moves,btohqsg
Thank you for your prompt reply! If tracker moves then is considered other catalogues spend and should be able part of $800 and the chosen cat will get to enjoy 8% right?,btohqsg
yes  but quite sure not counted,btohqsg
Axs confirm not counted to 800 min spend. But maybank fnf have a 0.3 percent back up to 50 dollar bill,btohqsg

Hi  I have a credit on my Citi SMRT card due to the redemption of the SMRT card points. Citi doesn't allow the credit to be transferred to another Citi card. The only way to spend on this card to draw down on the credit.Is there a way to withdraw this credit? I can only think of using it to buy vouchers  but wonder if there's another way that can withdraw and eventually credit into my bank account,btohqsg

Hello experts  does anyone know if public transport (bus/ mrt) is considered eligible spend for sc journey credit card for the welcome bonus of 45k miles?,btohqsg
Oh no. My scootplus got downgraded due to equipment change. They said will refund 30% base fare and 150$ voucher. Voucher will be issued after flight but nowhere to be seen. ü•≤,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt trust them. Demand 100% refund or go to the media. They‚Äôll cave and give you the full refund,btohqsg
