Thank you what is your Q number,btohqsg
940/1298 Chinese. You think can get a decent unit?,btohqsg
Want to ask something  I got a queue number of 500 in my AUG 2022 bto  if I apply for NOV 2022 bto  my number won‚Äôt cancel right? If I get a good number for NOV 2022 BTO  can I forfeit my AUG 2022 queue number? What is the timeline like for the time I get my NOV 2022 bto vs my AUG 2022 invitation date at HDB?,btohqsg
If u book a flat in either the aug 22 or nov 22 bto  hdb will ask u to sign a form to cancel the other bto application,btohqsg
It happened to me before‚Ä¶ i applied for nov 2021 bto and got a queue no of 417.. then i applied for may 2022 bto.. just nice 2 days before the release of may 2022 bto results i was invited to select a flat under nov 2021 tengah bto.. so i was asked to sign a form to cancel the may 2022 bto application,btohqsg
then wat if May  Aug got numbers  then Nov apply also,btohqsg
