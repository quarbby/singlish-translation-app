Hi  can I check if it’s always the case that citi pay all willRun some promo before may income tax payment cycle kick start? New to this.. and like to try using Citi pay all ..but not sure if should wait tillPromotional period or should I just sign…Also  assuming I choose to pay by 12 month instalment  few months later  they runs a promo. Can I use Citi pay all for the remaining months installment? Thanks in advance 🙏🏾,btohqsg
Do you plan to use Citi payall to pay income tax n other expenses n exceed $8k? Citi payall promo usually has minimum total $8k spend requirements. Or else you won’t get promo.,btohqsg
Always go for income tax instalment.Yes. U can always pay off early your future installments. But don’t overpay until credit balance overall.,btohqsg

Hi guys. Qn about the DBS womens world card.We just rcvd our card and had encountered some issues trying to pair it to some apps (like lazada). It keeps getting declined  saying the bank has declined the transaction.My husb tried buying a game off Steam and it was declined too.Called the bank and they said some websites and apps are flagged due to high fraudulent activities so whenever such transactions are declined  we need to call the bank to ask them to allow the transaction to go through.Seems like alot of work to be using this card..Is this something you guys encountered too? 🤔,btohqsg
One question. If I select dining for UOB lady’s card and link to instarem amaze  do I still get 4mpd when I pay with amaze?,btohqsg
that day I was at hermes singapore and wanted to link Amaze to UOB KF for 3mpd after i used the 4mpd cards.. but the Amaze transactions couldnt go through  so i used another general spending card. possibly the amount is too high,btohqsg
"With a quick search of ""uob lady amaze"":https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/186529",btohqsg
Which statement month is annual fee charged?,btohqsg
Hope you don't mind the amaze fees,btohqsg
in the end since i'm using general spending card  then i didnt need to link to Amaze to use,btohqsg
Hello gurus. Sorry to ask a noob question. Any idea what is the optimum timeline to apply for both lady and ppv? So as to avoid a much decrease in credit score?Details could be helpful:uob kf (approved on 11/1/24)crmc (approved on 2/1/24)uob kf (approved on 29/11/23)citPM (approved on 2/11/23),btohqsg

Hi for singsaver's 4mpd travel insurance promo  can i receive the rewards for buying the insurance for a family plan which does not include me?,btohqsg
UserAdminhas 2/3 warnings; be careful!Reason:don't post irrelevant links without context,btohqsg
5-6k not decided on airline yet. But family trip to japan,btohqsg
Use heymax and search for the airline / travel app name,btohqsg
if u are flying SQ then go to SQ's website/app and use the UOB KF cc to pay.Use the same card and book through expedia if booking other airlines.UOB KF gives u 3mpd uncapped which allows u to earn 18k miles on a $6k purchase,btohqsg

Hi  for trust card atm withdrawal is the rate bad or follows visa rate?,btohqsg
Long story short  don't use ezlink if you want better cashback/rewards,btohqsg
Amaze is now charging 1% for transactions exceeding SGD1000 thru linked card method and local transaction. That's a lot for Hermes,btohqsg
Maybe can look at unlimited cashback cards? It depends on your spending,btohqsg
I didn’t use Amaze in the end,btohqsg

Re the tips to maximise and keep getting 4.6% from hsbc ega account!1 transfer in 2k. Do 5 transaction per month for 300 cash credit2  rotate funds every other month in between two account. Person a hold funds in march (sms joined the march promotion)  then later rotate the fund to person b (sms join in april promotion) for example.3 setup giro for hsbc ega to pay tax  bills insurance and other credit cards (exclude hsbc and Trading platform with cybocurrency)Does this make sense?,btohqsg
