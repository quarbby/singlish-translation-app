Salad I ok I love salad ‚ô•Ô∏è,btohqsg
Carrot gd for eyes n night blindness,btohqsg
carrot juice I ok but then selling in the market  ones sugar gao gao,btohqsg

I think hor i can actually buy alot of carrots then i chop Liao throw inside freezer,btohqsg
frozen ones probably can last very long ba,btohqsg
Heard baby carrot not that gd,btohqsg
Super market already have frozen chopped carrot. Can last for years in Freezer,btohqsg
Oh no la I buy also buy adult ones lol why buy baby,btohqsg
expensive lol I chop myself save probably 90% money,btohqsg
Many western easteries use bb carrot as easier to cook n no need cut,btohqsg
I see I see  I prefer adult ones ~,btohqsg
No sure any diff in cost. I know they flash freeze the carrot. So when you take out and cook  will not be mushy,btohqsg
Just like frozen cauliflower n broccoli cost alot more in frozen packs,btohqsg
hmmm I buy Liao  Straight away throw to my freezer should be ok I think I hope ü§£,btohqsg
wet market sell usually much cheaper ‚ô•Ô∏è,btohqsg
If your freezer has the flash freezing mode. Then ok.Or if your taste bud is not particular also ok I guess,btohqsg
I bought like 20 corns peeled it and dumped it in my freezer hahaha,btohqsg
