Thanks! Is it the same MCC when buying groceries at fairprice?,btohqsg
Does anyone have a problem with grabcard transactions today? Tried paying for something online but it keeps saying insufficient funds when there is.,btohqsg
Hi. Can CIMB World Mastercard be linked with Amaze and earn Cashbacks?,btohqsg
Cimb exclude amaze transaction if i am not wrong,btohqsg

Hi  can I check if I can pay my renovation with cardup -charge to HSBC revolution to hit the min spend for Singsaver promo?,btohqsg
are they both integrated shield plan?,btohqsg
can request fee waiver  subjected to approval,btohqsg
Depends how you look at it ba  but amaze online conversion is more of a hack than the official purpose of it. They just havenâ€™t nerf this yet  maybe they donâ€™t know what to call this function to nerf it,btohqsg
Itâ€™s probably traceable if they want to,btohqsg
One is shield plan  one is just company hospital benefit. not sure if its legal to claim twice.,btohqsg
Use AXS pay+earn but need to pay service 2.5%,btohqsg
I donâ€™t think you can even claim twice  you should only be able to claim if one plan doesnâ€™t fully cover the spending and if the other one does  they reimburse the difference that is not covered by the other plan.Why would insurance companies be dumb enough to reimburse you twice and you make a profit out of it? And this can be seen as fraud probably,btohqsg
If previously I've setup the GIRO with another bank and want to switch to HSBC EGA  is it possible?Second question  I read earlier in the chat that it's possible to also use CardUp to pay tax even thought previous GIRO arrangement has been made  just that the I'll need to setup the CardUp payment date to be before the 6th of each month so as to not have IRAS deduct from the current GIRO plan  is my understanding correct?,btohqsg
Just to seek clarification  For cardup income tax 2024 promotion  the T&Cs state  the offer may be redeemed 2 times per user on or before 31 Aug. If setting up as monthly payment is the 1.75% rate applicable only for 2 months or the entire 12 months?,btohqsg
Need to be before giro is initate so always better to pay early if u want via cardup route,btohqsg
"Hi  do anyone know if MCC 7011 qualify as UOB lady's card ""travel"""" category rewards?",btohqsg
Just wonder singsaver gift iPad 9th genIt is 2021 model,btohqsg
can i still use ins with the mc?,btohqsg
Company hospital benefit meaning corporate insurance or company let you claim hospital bill? Is 2 different things.,btohqsg
Thats right  they paid 10k for my operation  i did not have to claim . Just wondering for the followup treatments if I can double claim  since im paying myself first.,btohqsg
Just send interbank GIRO form to IRAS through physical mail and they will process it within 21 days.For CardUp payments  you pay this month for the following month (i.e. pay on 12 Jun for Jul). IRAS will reconcile the payment for the month paid when payment comes.,btohqsg
Hi all  i applied for DCS masters platimum card but got rejected. I meet the min income level though. Anyone experienced this also?,btohqsg
U not suppose to double claim,btohqsg
So is company claim and not corporate insurance la.. I mean if you try and successfully do it  then get caught for insurance fraud/abusing company policy  it's on you ðŸ¤¡,btohqsg
Go read article on recent bank of singapore saga on anyhow claim,btohqsg
Haha we already say cannot ma.. ppl think they 500 IQ to double claim  get caught then their own fault liao. Play stupid games  win stupid prizes.,btohqsg
My Confirmed Income Tax Relief for YA2024 NOAhttps://youtu.be/LBGJ-XbDABg,btohqsg
Its corporate insurance. So the flow is initially hospital bills are paid by personal insurance. Then personal insurance claim against my corporate insurance.But just wondering if I pay subsequent follow up and then have to claim myself   how is it tracked?Who is so free to check if everyone is doing it or not. Follow up money are not that huge anyway.,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for interactive broker. How come I donâ€™t see recurring investment? Is there some sort of setting to do? Additionally  due to the minimum USD conversion rate  is it advisable to deposit USD instead?,btohqsg
You think they don't do audit meh? Like what Queenie said  go read article on BOS false claims lor...Like at most what's the worst right? Pay back  lose job  can't find new job in the same industry?,btohqsg
Aiya  later he kena flag and ask to explain then show his reply to finance lol.,btohqsg
Personally i am contended to earn miles or cashback from paying the follow up first then claim from insurance liao. Not so *smart* to double claim,btohqsg
Hi all  anyone know hdl ps mcc is 5812?ðŸ¤ª thanks,btohqsg
Hopefully it's part of how their system runs and its a happy feature to have such that it doesn't cost much to them. Pray hard.,btohqsg
Did you apply for another bank's card recently?,btohqsg
They probably have a system in place to track who claim from where and what. You think people manually key in these entry and calculate how much left you can claim meh? Probably once you claim from one side  you canâ€™t claim the whole bill from the other side.Not huge why you want try to risk to claim both side? Actually nvm  can go try and let us know?,btohqsg
No i didnt. Will it be better to apply thru their website or their app?,btohqsg
When was the last time you applied for another bank's card? Why would applying another way be any better?,btohqsg
Very interesting leh these people  want to challenge the system then later come back say jialat cannot do it,btohqsg
Double claim can be consider fraud  not exactly a simple system loophole,btohqsg
I mean he sounded so confident can do that and say cannot track so let him try loh,btohqsg
How is that not recent lol,btohqsg
Bos saga also is a few year record all kena dig up and people got fire for small claims,btohqsg
Oh cannot alw apply card? How often can apply?,btohqsg
Hahaha sure got ppl doing it at his company now that's why he's asking,btohqsg
They sure have some things in place since that happened.,btohqsg
All record kept for at least 7 year,btohqsg
Like i say if want to risk go risk big  dont risk for small amt. Rmb city harvest  misappropiate million get a few year term  misappropiate small amt get longer term then millions,btohqsg
Big amount  higher chance of getting flag,btohqsg
