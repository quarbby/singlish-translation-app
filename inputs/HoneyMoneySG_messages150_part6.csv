its not but i rather take some risk to earn potential 10x more than leaving it in my OA account? It's my parents btw üò¨Worth?,btohqsg
Hi all expert card holders  do you have any recommendation card which best match spending on the list below:TravelDinnershopping(online and retail)TransportAnd qualified to earn rewards from contactless and online payment type.,btohqsg
ILPs are almost never worth it unless you're incompetent  search up Philips POEMS Amundi MSCI world fund  you can use CPFIS-OA to purchase at zero sales charge and low expense ratio,btohqsg
Then you must know that your iLP money can lose value if not managed properly. You can go through the chat history to know such examples. My iLP with prudential lose 40%,btohqsg
im not sure if ILPs are really that bad because here is my ILP 2.5 years in. Maybe pru you lost because of the fund you chose and their high fees of 3.3% ?,btohqsg
Most importantly are your parents OK to lose everything? Past two years the market has been performing well in my noob opinion.,btohqsg
My goal is to help increase their retirement money. And what better way than to invest it rightI believe they prefer to let someone handle their investments than to do it themselves because they dont have any investment knowledgeShort term lock ins for then as well for this ILP   can be withdrawn anytime without charges,btohqsg
My ilp break even I guess for the past 20 years if I take it positively. However even if I have placed it in a fixed deposit I guess I would have made at least 30% more?,btohqsg
Most importantly this is financial advice. No one can advise you legally.,btohqsg
Got good got bad ILPs la especially whether your agent honours his words for watching out for u,btohqsg
I have two prudential ILP the agent over the last 20 years switch in and switch out for me at the right time average every year grow 10%,btohqsg
Also had one AIA ILP that the agent mia after getting comm then 20 years in negative but because capital guaranteed so i only lost opportunity cost,btohqsg
Two years ago bought one n now the growth is 40% overall,btohqsg
Any way to go around this?,btohqsg
You can‚Äôt top up SA if it hits FRS. Wait until 55 then you can top up RA to hit ERS,btohqsg
Top up to your MA or love ones SA (income must be below certain low threshold) are the only options left...,btohqsg
Heard the prestige floor is 114k. Vantage not sure but if it appears in app high chance of approval.Can always try and report dp here. Can also apply Amex plat charge if that works for you. The income requirement should be lower,btohqsg
Ooo ok let see if it appears on my app üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes thru my safra DBS CC. Recent updated dec 2024  not sure if that‚Äôs counted. But they increase my CC limit,btohqsg
Ok they already did limit increase  nothing much you can do in this case,btohqsg
Btw I realized CardUp charge 3.4$ if the charging amount is less than 130$. 500 points gained.Then Citi pay all is at 1.30$ fee. But 50 points gained.Tired sia to count. But cardup mor ex . But the points might be actually worth it if taking the 1.3$ fee to 10 times that‚Äôs 13$ for 500 points üòÇ,btohqsg
Ok I shall cry at one corner üòÇ,btohqsg
Oh yes I want to point out  if I do this for my air con servicing. Do usually people accept to wait 5 working days to receive the payment? üòÇ. My time without all this so is cash  card up is really new to me.,btohqsg
Congrats on hitting your FRSSadly no way around it. I guess it is a happy problem.If tax relief is your objective You can top your MA (max $8 000) subject to BHS limit of $75 500 for 2025You can top up your loved ones SA/RA/MA (max $8 000). Do check the criteria of your loved ones income.,btohqsg
Then need to wait for income to grow. Work on that first?But why are u going for the 120k cards? Haha,btohqsg
Usually if I know the vendor I prepay,btohqsg
Cause existing card holders can apply n get 40k miles,btohqsg
Hahaa then slowly I guess. If not Citi prestige with the FD optionNot sure whether vantage has that option,btohqsg
I suspect if one‚Äôs credit report has 120k credit limit. Might have a possibility to get one. I guess when I get there I update u all if is possible üòÇ.,btohqsg
120k credit limit for each bank means your income is 120k already.The limit jumps once u reach 120k,btohqsg
Oh .. no la not each bank üòÇ sum total of the CC I have,btohqsg
Which banks do you have cards with? If you are after signup bonuses  can shop around first.,btohqsg
You referring to OP right? Hahaha I already exhausted most sign up bonus ü§£ not young already,btohqsg
Citi only left with citigold center. Not sure how one can do deposit for credit card these days.,btohqsg
I did. I left with UOB  may bank  SC and CIMB.Just gotten UOB prvimiles  SC journey and Citi rewards card (old bird)So I can earn miles from privmiles  journey for now. Then FnF for sign up bonuses and UOB KF for upcap rewards for MCC 5812 for my wedding Lolol,btohqsg
That time young  go any how sign up for cash back of AirPods. But thinking to cancel after a year. But that never happened üòÇ,btohqsg
Of course feel free if there‚Äôs a better way to go about this and I do my DD,btohqsg
For wedding. You can still utilize 30k income cards for it. Need to negotiate with the place to let you split payments.,btohqsg
Thank you for this  so I‚Äôve checked  4 cards per bill only. Cause is a restaurant not a hotel. Lolol,btohqsg
We find banquet overrated and same old same old. Capitalism hits . Copy and paste üòÇ,btohqsg
UOB lady dining 1kUob ppv 1.1kUOB VS 2kUOB KF to sweep the restüòÅAgain check mcc to be very sure,btohqsg

Ya man! LOL! I thought vantage was the card. But thank you all for sharing  KF is now the option keke,btohqsg
UOB KF is uncapped 3mpd for 5812  5813  5814 (1.2mpd first then 1.8mpd if meet 800$ spend on SIA grp),btohqsg
It is lah. It‚Äôs my behind the scenes cardWhen my PP renew I will go redeem a Prosecco at airport using the 10X PP,btohqsg
Yaaa! My colleague shared that I can potentially earn 9 mpd on the restaurant I‚Äôve shared. Unfortunately they just remove out from Kris+. Otherwise I could earn 4-9mpd üò≠,btohqsg
Have you tested how many pp account can one use?,btohqsg
