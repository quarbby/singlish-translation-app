Hi. Plan to pay jpy for my hotel onbooking.comShould I use uob kf directly or pair with amaze and use uob kf?Have lady but not travel category,btohqsg
If you hit the annual $800 spend for SIA group  you should use UOB KF directly for 3mpd. Am worried the Amaze* prefix may prevent UOB KF from registeringwww.booking.comfor 3mpd.,btohqsg
Some gave this same advice previously.,btohqsg
The higher fx cost might offset such benefit.,btohqsg
Ah so best to pay using JPY directly with youtrip/amaze(wallet)?,btohqsg
I would have used amaze + Uob lady travel. But op stated clearly his lady isnâ€™t travel category so kind of stuck.,btohqsg

Have a look at UOB prvi visa but it's only 1.4mpd. FYI  no cards can get 4mpd on cardup.,btohqsg
Noted with thanks! I donâ€™t hv prvi. If that the case is there any difference for using any card?,btohqsg
UOB prvi visa has highest earn rate among entry level cards (1.4mpd). Visa version can use with Chris code for lower fee when paying income tax via cardupChristine,btohqsg
Actually what benefit do we get by using card up cause still need to pay 2.6% or 1.76% transaction fee?,btohqsg
HONEYMONEY for 30 off or HMTAX24 for lower admin fee,btohqsg
Oh No! I donâ€™t know where I got itâ€¦.,btohqsg
Can u enlighten me on the the above? I am quite lost. Aging ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
"It's a way for miles chaser to ""buy"" miles from expenses that usually don't give rewards. It's costly and sometimes not worth for many.",btohqsg
Chris's promo codes are here for reference >>https://t.me/sgpromocode/16,btohqsg
Donâ€™t quite understand. I used a credit card & use card up to pay for taxes thatâ€™s it. How do miles comes along? Kindly adviseâ€¦..,btohqsg
You pay cardup money (income tax + fee) using credit card and earn miles from that. Then cardup will pay iras on ur behalf.,btohqsg

Appreciate if u could advise. I feel paying 1.76% for a 1.4Mpd not so worth it. What do u think?,btohqsg
Yup. So options are- Amaze uob kf- Uob kf- Youtrip/revolutI guess it will be Amaze uob kf,btohqsg
Ma am your collection of cards is interesting. I wonder did u choose the cards urself or did someone pick for u?,btohqsg
