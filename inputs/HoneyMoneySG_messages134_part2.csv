Thanks! I read the T&C  doesn‚Äôt work üòÖ,btohqsg
so u have uob one account but dun need bonus interest? Then better use other high interest account without need for spending.btw can spend on uob lady/evol/one/lazada credit card to meet $500 card spend for up to 4% interest on uob one account  not compulsory to spend on uob one debit card,btohqsg
Better to just find a different card and different account lol. If you can't meet the spend criteria  better to just put somewhere without it.,btohqsg

UOB ppv is not bad but what is ur use case and what are other cards that you have?,btohqsg
I have uob lady and citi reward/amaze. Cancelled hsbc revo as its nerfed so I am wondering if thr are any other cards to replace it :),btohqsg
I will not recommend it as there are costs if I‚Äôm not wrong in the execution of an equity loan. Those costs can easily take the small margins of 0.7% you need to jump through some hoops to make.,btohqsg
Are you looking for offline or online spend?Uob ppv is a good offline card but avoid uob$ merchant,btohqsg
More of offline spend! As i use my citi rewards fr online spend alr,btohqsg
is it possible to use simplygo for yuu to hit the 600 target per mth for 13% rebate for other yuu spends?(i know there's no rebates),btohqsg
yes this is also a very viable strategy to MAX OUT 2.6% p.a. HDB LOAN.. since you can always repay back anytime without penalty.TLDR: anybody who can access HDB loan should always STRETCH IT TO THE MAX..,btohqsg
