She has not reassured me of my symptoms,btohqsg
So i keep talking and asking,btohqsg
dang respect i thought u were j2,btohqsg
what are the chances of nie,btohqsg
I'm actually a working adult now,btohqsg
Then when she retake...were her results nowhere still near the pre-requisities for med,btohqsg
That is why dun go ane when ur symptoms or not serious enough‚Ä¶just pop urself into gp or polyclinic,btohqsg
what can u do with a math degree?,btohqsg
I actually have a lot of friends who major in math and got NIE scholarships,btohqsg
Of course they ended up teaching math in schools in the end,btohqsg
at least she kenna sponsored overseas uni lol,btohqsg
So they only provide free if u go ane??,btohqsg
So yes you can actually major in math and then go to NIE,btohqsg
As for the chances  I don't know,btohqsg
Bruh erm what is w the govt and them trying to siam ppl fr ane,btohqsg
For me  teaching is not my first career after I graduated,btohqsg
Dr referred me to ane n then when my dad came  the nurse got scolded coz my dad scolded them say dr anyhow refer me to aneüíÄ,btohqsg
I used to consider it for mid career  but not anymore,btohqsg
Mine is the field of SWE and data science,btohqsg
The reason is I feel that having the industrial experience and coming to teach in schools will help to benefit the education more,btohqsg
ooh so like freelancer just sort out company data and yea?,btohqsg
Back then I felt that a lot of the education is more of like learning something but why do you need to learn it that type of thing,btohqsg
math major to NIE is either getting the scholarship halfway through undergrad then PGDE or apply for PGDE after graduating,btohqsg
But that point is when i hv not tested positive  i went gp coz i needed an mc and not confirmed covid yet,btohqsg
Then i fell when walking to the dr room,btohqsg
So people seem to like lose interest in stuff,btohqsg
And was hving a super high fever (39.2),btohqsg
No la we don't sort out company data,btohqsg
Yes we do that but that's probably the 0.01% of the jobscope,btohqsg
Mine is more of using the weather data and do predictions,btohqsg
Bruh the doctor did not even suspect covid (until my dad brought it up to her),btohqsg
tbh just look up what data science entails and you'll get a more thorough answer,btohqsg
LOL nah for me is my heartbeat rate increased by alot  or smth when doc used stethoscope to listen...END UP need to measure BP monitor to measure my BP,btohqsg
bc data science is very broad,btohqsg
Recently my job is more operations research related,btohqsg
My previous project is actually on supermarkets,btohqsg
It was coz i couldnt walk (i fell while walking to the dr rm then the nurse need to hold me over + my fever was 39.2,btohqsg
So we want to do an order replenishment system for items sold in the supermarket,btohqsg
investigate why mama shops charge cheaper than fairprice?,btohqsg
i mean getting a job that uses math vs math math is diff,btohqsg
Like how many to replenish per day for each supermarkets,btohqsg
if you want MATH math you're looking at academia alr,btohqsg
My heartbeat do go up too (it was 93 once),btohqsg
nowadays i feel fairprice not fair anymore,btohqsg
So we want to find a way not to order too much to incur wastage,btohqsg
We don't want to order too little so that the supermarkets cannot earn profit when they have more potential to,btohqsg
So we have to find a logic such that we can earn profit  earn sales  reduce wastage and achieve such goals,btohqsg
oh ya cuz sg economy is down now,btohqsg
write an mc for my dear lance coporal yt,btohqsg
So our work is related to Japanese supermarkets,btohqsg
Recently I know that NTUC wants to do something similar,btohqsg
Omg recently donki brought in the jap kitkats,btohqsg
Don't humble lah Si Yan !,btohqsg
Yea lor so this is what I am doing,btohqsg
So yes a lot of studying of the trends of goods,btohqsg
And how we can best optimize for the results,btohqsg
And how to implement the algorithm,btohqsg
Which is why it is DS + SWE,btohqsg
Data science because you are using data to study the trends and probably classify these goods,btohqsg
Software engineering is because you want to implement such solutions and design a software for it,btohqsg
so u designed the don don donki app,btohqsg
man I will flour dump the shit out of u,btohqsg
so when we shop we get some rank points,btohqsg
No we don't create the don don donki app,btohqsg
hmm i think i should shop more,btohqsg
to get a better uas scoreüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Is the reduce wastage thing why many Japanese supermarkets sell perishables at a discount just before closing,btohqsg
When I did operations mine was literally excel sheets,btohqsg
Also what prefecture are you working in,btohqsg
oh no wonder dddk sell 20% off after 8pm and 40% off after 10pm,btohqsg
I still miss the ‚Äú50% off stickers‚Äù when shopping for snacks at night,btohqsg
Not as much as some goods/supermarkets in Japan,btohqsg
Time to visit them at night,btohqsg
Like I still recall in Japan  half in kanji is the same as the Chinese characters,btohqsg
So I can see the ‚Äú‰∏ÄÂçä‚Äù,btohqsg
Then I immediately know is half off,btohqsg
I cant read kanji but i can read hiragana,btohqsg
Oh I am actually working in Tokyo,btohqsg
I wish I could visit Tokyo during my dec 2023 trip but parents don‚Äôt want,btohqsg
But shag the dddk is like in orchard,btohqsg
Last time I always go to Cold Storage and buy those roasted chicken,btohqsg
bro i notice sgreans always eat dinner at 9+,btohqsg
Also idk why ddk is not called don quijote in Singapore,btohqsg
If they don't sell it  they have to throw it away (which is a 100% loss for them),btohqsg
So this is why they put a discount on it,btohqsg
It is called don don donki what,btohqsg
At one ddk there was a claw machine with mine donki penguins,btohqsg
It‚Äôs called don Quijote in Japan,btohqsg
Oh i tot u mean sg,btohqsg
bruh wtf my neighbour drilling at 11pm,btohqsg
Don Quijote Co.  Ltd.Its overseas locations are branded as Don Don Donki. Don Quijote Co.  Ltd. It provides a wide range of products  from basic groceries to electronics and clothing. The store is well known in Japan and is often referred to by its shortened name Donki („Éâ„É≥„Ç≠).,btohqsg
But the song still play don don donki  which makes it weird,btohqsg
I thought can only do morning till 5pm,btohqsg
The rules only applies to companies i think,btohqsg
I thot all renovations in residential estate can‚Äôt do after a certain time,btohqsg
I think only applies to renovation works by company‚Ä¶ppl can drill themselves,btohqsg
I dun think there are any restrictions,btohqsg
Ya I see it once in a while but I feel that this practice is more common in Japan,btohqsg
I came to some bakery in a supermarket right before it closed and got all these,btohqsg
Like the staff will just slap on new discount stickers close to closing time  and usually will apply greater discounts for items that have more excess stock,btohqsg
As best as they can  they really want to reduce wastage,btohqsg
It is actually something they want to do,btohqsg
And then comparing to having a 50% loss and a 100% loss  they would rather take the 50% loss,btohqsg
I rmbr only in Japan saying the true part of Japan is in the countryside,btohqsg
But city life looks way more happening than Singapore,btohqsg
But because there are way more tourists here now,btohqsg
Japan life hor very simple one,btohqsg
Its cafe hopping  karaoke  watching movies,btohqsg
Ah I see. I wish it were a more common practice here  but I can also see why some stalls don‚Äôt want to adopt this practice. It might appear to devalue their food and some people may prefer to just hold out and buy at a cheaper price instead of buying at the regular price,btohqsg
The arcades also seem very fun,btohqsg
Actually it also depends on the shelf life,btohqsg
Let say the stuff is going to expire in today's time,btohqsg
So probably there will be discount there to encourage people buying the stuff so they can clear the stock,btohqsg
Yeah those perishables that only last one day most likely they will just give the discounts right before closing,btohqsg
Singapore actually has that practice ngl,btohqsg
In Singapore at least we have one thing which Japan doesn‚Äôt have which is Treatsure,btohqsg
Just that they are on some other sections,btohqsg
Like if its going to expire bread,btohqsg
You won't see it in the bread section,btohqsg
It appears in one small corner,btohqsg
Plus Japan has way more perishables,btohqsg
Like you buy today expire today type,btohqsg
So you tend to see way more of such discounts compared to in SG,btohqsg
So its not like you don't see it,btohqsg
And some more it‚Äôs from some random supermarket bakery,btohqsg
Japan stuff feels more high quality in general,btohqsg
It is more of such perishables won't be very common anyway,btohqsg
dont they focus high emphasis on keeping things neat or clean,btohqsg
Also sandwiches in Japan are crazy,btohqsg
I find all sorts of random stuff in there,btohqsg
Who tf can't read a course outline lmao,btohqsg
Yea lor Japan supermarkets also have more sandwich compared to at Singapore,btohqsg
There‚Äôs one with custard pudding  another one with orange,btohqsg
I wish we have such variety,btohqsg
finding a dirty vehicle is near impossible in japan..in sg  you just spent 5 mins and you see a 100k bmw with road dust,btohqsg
Actually there are dirty places in Japan as well,btohqsg
You all just never go to such places,btohqsg
Yeah I guess so but I feel like Japanese take pride in their profession and what they do,btohqsg
A lot of people also thought Singapore is clean,btohqsg
Bruh moment I just had an announcement from one of mods saying pls submit in the submission folder,btohqsg
You go to other places in Singapore also can be dirty,btohqsg
Bruh moment apparently some ppl dk how to do that in NTUlearn,btohqsg
I mean I guess every country has their own dirty places but I just don‚Äôt know where to find in Japan,btohqsg
Actually every time I go to Shibuya,btohqsg
other country borrow money from sg then cannot pay back so we import trash to their country,btohqsg
In Tokyo can you find them?,btohqsg
The sewage smell is super bad,btohqsg
The floor is made of floor,btohqsg
but in southeast asia and certain european countries..yea,btohqsg
I also miss my go go curry,btohqsg
Once ns is done I hope I can go Japan again,btohqsg
godamn how much is that in sgd,btohqsg
I sort of forgot alr unfortunately. But should be around 10-12,btohqsg
We have cocoichibanya but as expected more expensive than Japan,btohqsg
It's actually in the system lmao,btohqsg
I saw it that guy did the exchange and tried to transfer the mods,btohqsg
Decent but I think go go curry is better in terms of ingredients. Cocochiban curry is slightly better than gogocurry if I didn‚Äôt recall wrongly,btohqsg
I only ate Coco once in Japan,btohqsg
I alr maxed out my cap liao.,btohqsg
Y1 and Y2 got a cap of 6AUs per AY for transfer,btohqsg
WHAT THE FUCK THOMAS JEFFERSON HIT THE GRIDDY IN HAMILTON,btohqsg
It's possible if u take a GEM Trailblazer Mod but the school don't accept it as Core or MPE,btohqsg
Basically u get 4 baskets and u decide which one to put your mods u took lor,btohqsg
As long as it ain't your MPE or Core,btohqsg
You Biz got how many BDEs sia?,btohqsg
Usually BDEs is the easiest basket to fulfil,btohqsg
GEM explorer is there cuz it clears MPEs for us,btohqsg
"he hit the griddy at the ""theres no way hes gonna be president""",btohqsg
i would've gone if i didn't alr watch it too many times online,btohqsg
the king was even funnier than the broadway one ngl,btohqsg
the king for the broadway one was such a meme,btohqsg
at least we got funny scat,btohqsg
So u got 4 thay are fully unrestricted?,btohqsg
4 is within the cap for Y1 and Y2,btohqsg
I hit my cap cuz I transfer 12 lol,btohqsg
Cannot need to do it in Y2 S1,btohqsg
just get the cert and it's free AUs,btohqsg
i spammed the shit outta it bc they expanded it in my year,btohqsg
then initially the choices were very broad,btohqsg
then they restricted it more lol,btohqsg
I hit my cap and am on track for Y3 Standing but those c*nts take 2 months to transfer my exchange credits so I won't be able to do it in time for stars,btohqsg
Never gonna be a Y3 ig.,btohqsg
the year you are in the ntu system depends on your AUs cleared,btohqsg
ig that's what he's referring to,btohqsg
and that affects when your STARs is,btohqsg
i mean even within some of the undergrad halls there are rooms for grad students,btohqsg
Your Standing is AU based not year based,btohqsg
Well unless u are in a double program,btohqsg
it's quite common to be ahead of your year,btohqsg
I would be but they take 2 months to transfer the credits :/,btohqsg
And because so that means it will reflect in the next semester so 25+ like 24 will auto put me in Y4,btohqsg
donki claw machine is a scam. $2 for 1 token  idk the price in jap tho,btohqsg

Read the qn and identify there will usually be 2 sub qns you need to answer in ur email,btohqsg
Highlight them and come up with 3 mini peel to 1 subqn each,btohqsg
But it can't be applied to everything right,btohqsg
idk bro this is like u have to look at the qn and be specific,btohqsg
Also this mf at the back so noisy,btohqsg
on the bright side i got A for h2 math,btohqsg
I think being mr lim‚Äôs math rep gave me h2 math luck to score A,btohqsg
I think it is ok  it is ur first exam,btohqsg
the paper is h2 math but fmath standard,btohqsg
Itz ok to screw ur first exam coz look at this,btohqsg
if it was chem i think id double kms,btohqsg

if its like priv tuition no cpf,btohqsg
Just like find trusted ppl don‚Äôt solicit for students online,btohqsg

The grades itself  but everyone same same page la according to the percentile,btohqsg
Is he also ur math tutor,btohqsg
Wah that means the cohort did relatively bad,btohqsg
You don't announce to the whole world like on social media can liao,btohqsg
Also don't make it like too obvious (aka giving tuition during your weekends),btohqsg
And don't be dumb and ask your supervisors if you can take leave because you have to teach tuition,btohqsg
Find a way to negotiate with the student/parent,btohqsg

Apparently a sec school girl died,btohqsg
you said there were 2 deaths,btohqsg
Shin min FB headlines has it now,btohqsg
And driver of the black mpv I think,btohqsg
About the incident? Yea I got more pics from online of it,btohqsg
where u see this? mothership js said 8 injured,btohqsg
Maybe ah  but hearsay hor. From people on scene,btohqsg
Online photos   circled are bodies. I've blackened them to be sfw,btohqsg
Maybe injured ah but hearsay got deaths,btohqsg
if onsite will have blue tent,btohqsg
cuz news says 8 sent to hosp,btohqsg
Ngl I see the uncensored  one of them look like a certain death to me,btohqsg
cuz if die onsite  will have police blue tent,btohqsg
Haha think I only have the national exams certs la,btohqsg
Anwar? Not his direct successor but he came into office later after the 2022 GE. Anwar was supposed to be PM though but Mahathir refused to handover  and in 2020 there was the infamous Sheraton move where some PKR MPs switched parties and Bersatu withdrew from Pakatan Harapan. You can read up about this online,btohqsg
Wah didn‚Äôt know this was in the h2 history syllabus. I wish it was in h1,btohqsg
Anyway it feels like reformasi is dead now,btohqsg
I Legit want to beat this woman up,btohqsg
Let me try find when I get home tonight wahaha,btohqsg
im feeling so underprepared for something important in 8min,btohqsg
Today my JAE friend ask me if we alrlearn alot of the h2math topics and sadly yes,btohqsg
Did not know so many things not in o lvl,btohqsg
Which part of the paper is this in? And is it something like schools can choose different countries to cover so not all schs will cover this?,btohqsg
idk we are doing essay for sea this year and sbq for intl hist,btohqsg
Oh ok. I saw the syllabus doc and it mentioned Malaysia a few times but it didn‚Äôt specifically say what events are covered besides Konfrontasi,btohqsg
After the IO beat him up iirc,btohqsg
I wonder if polsci or history would be better,btohqsg
Even tho my history is a C I still find it so much more interesting than geog,btohqsg
If I do become a Cher for the sake of MOE requiring teachers to be qualified in teaching 2 subjects I may choose to do econs+geog in nus but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll like it,btohqsg
Maybe in nie I‚Äôll train for geog even if I have no intention of teaching it,btohqsg
It‚Äôs a bit stupid that 2 subjects requirement if the teachers don‚Äôt ever teach their 2nd subject,btohqsg
I want to teach h3 PW,btohqsg
I guess they just want more flexibility,btohqsg
Also it was the police chief not the IO sry,btohqsg
What was that clash Royale thing,btohqsg
My GP A is a fluke,btohqsg
At least geog I think I can ask whether I can trained for sec sch,btohqsg
Actually maybe doobdoob can provide some advice,btohqsg
The car did not brake at all  no amount of laws can stop someone like that,btohqsg
I saw the video. It‚Äôs unfortunate that reckless driving isn‚Äôt punishable by the death penalty. I feel like the black car driver was doing that intentionally,btohqsg
TJC has confirmed that one of their J1 students was involved in the accident (sch announcement),btohqsg
TJC just recently moved to tampines (TPJC campus),btohqsg
From TJC  can confirm  it aint good,btohqsg
The other serious party seem to be father,btohqsg
they say dad now in surgery,btohqsg
The speeder's car is the least damaged from what I see,btohqsg
i saw the pov of the dashcam footage,btohqsg
How did the pedestrians got involved? Is it it happened during a discretionary R turn?,btohqsg
Huh i tot his car was the overturned one,btohqsg
Oh i was referring to the one that dash out of nowhere,btohqsg
Side t bone  likely was father daughter,btohqsg
Side t boned daughter was ejected from the rear,btohqsg
i was js there js now,btohqsg
wonder how they get the footage so fast,btohqsg
i mean like every1 knows just to send to this acc,btohqsg
near tp i think safra also,btohqsg
Btw unconfirmed but the other death may have been the passenger of the speeding saab,btohqsg
Either that or passenger of pest control vanBoth from online comments,btohqsg
Two people getting cpr  a stretcher fetching the father can be seen later in other frames beside the flipped suv,btohqsg
Sgroads telegram  same telegram credited by mothership,btohqsg
It's a black market server because its used to spot traffic police  roadblocks and fuel checks around Singapore,btohqsg
Black market for a reason mah  ppl want to speed  want to enjoy their cars/bikes/ go jb to pump gas,btohqsg
Safety for bikers for rain  avoid long jams  drink a bit still want to drive,btohqsg
they say is a passenger of one of the vans,btohqsg
I heard about it from my tutee as well,btohqsg
Yea someone in a TikTok comment said it was the passenger of pest control van,btohqsg
this one not even my area,btohqsg
A Temasek JC student is among at least 2 people killed in the multi-vehicle accident in Tampines.https://str.sg/kYwk,btohqsg
Was the driver drunk? He was driving very erratically on the road leading up to the junction,btohqsg
But my Condolences to the family & friends of those who passed. üôè,btohqsg
A 17-year-old girl & a 57-year-old woman died in the Tampines accident this morning.8 other people were injured  including 2 11-year-olds.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://bit.ly/4b5nVG2Follow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
"Straits Times writes so clearly in the headlines ""A Temasek JC Student"" üò≠",btohqsg
Estimated speed of driver entering junction was 120kph,btohqsg
That's like double the speed limit on normal roads (50/60km/h),btohqsg
Calculation was done based off distance of light pole to the bus stop and a dash camera,btohqsg
And I hope that all is well and everyone gets better,btohqsg
Js 5 min away from my house,btohqsg
When u ord? And u ord as emt ah,btohqsg
is apparently my pri sch librarian daughter,btohqsg
the girl that passed away  the mother works at my pri sch,btohqsg
i feel it's more than that  150kph or greater. but just my guess,btohqsg
he didn't even step on the brake,btohqsg
scarier thoughtIt's an EV whose brakes programming failed,btohqsg
But that doesn‚Äôt explain why the car is speeding in the first place,btohqsg
Wasn't there a taxi that did exactly that idk if it was a ev tho,btohqsg
disclaimer  just thinking aloud:the failed software bug might have happened earlier  and when he steps on the brakes  it accelerated instead,btohqsg
but it's not an ev though so what is this about?,btohqsg
it's just a random thought of things that could happen,btohqsg
not necessarily that it applies to this,btohqsg
You are only free once you ROD,btohqsg
This was the car the speeder used,btohqsg
A extremely rare car in singapore,btohqsg
Or if you migrate to the overseas and work and came back after you are too old to serve,btohqsg

Yea like what I said lol,btohqsg
If u ask me u know what is the answer,btohqsg
You must go fast to flip a SUV 270 degrees parallel,btohqsg
guys ltr idw do h3 bio and ended up doing h3 chem,btohqsg
@aforacejiejie will be the reason why,btohqsg
i wanna do h3 rizzology studies,btohqsg
Wah wah this one ah jump fr h1 go to h3 hp is a bit too much,btohqsg
forthe last time I don't take econs,btohqsg
aiya h1h2 content same same h3 also lah,btohqsg
If only my chem did btr in j1  i would hv taken h3 chem instead of math,btohqsg
"tbh how did econs become the ""default"" humanities",btohqsg
cuz never take during o lvl,btohqsg
because ppl keep assuming I take BCME for some reason,btohqsg
Idk but i know it before entering,btohqsg
because ppl got traumatised from history and geog,btohqsg
I mean it's expected la but still I a bit :p,btohqsg
im still thinking between history and econs,btohqsg
H3 bio + H3 chem + H3 math + H3 geog lets go,btohqsg
because i do enjoy history (im barely passing),btohqsg
Nah just kidding I don't take geog,btohqsg
+ h3 gp and pw and mt,btohqsg
or why I send the pic about Anwar in the morning,btohqsg
And i took econs coz tbh i dun like the rest,btohqsg
For a very long time I thought econs was cooking,btohqsg
but i also used to learn a lot about market,btohqsg
if you're not interested in SEA hist take h1 hist,btohqsg
so i figure econs would be better for me,btohqsg
h1 hist is just o level history buffed,btohqsg
I feel like if you don't have interest for hist  taking h2 can be super painful,btohqsg
i might just take h2 econs,btohqsg
Then again I'm the only person taking my combination in my cohort so,btohqsg
School econs is the economics we study‚Ä¶dd ss  exchange rate  monetary policy  fiscal policy,btohqsg
if i even can get 4h2,btohqsg
My school had no home econs  they called it fce,btohqsg
but only if u get mc from siyan,btohqsg
I mean tbh not taking econs is like when you see ppl yapping econs stuff you don't understand what they saying,btohqsg
None of my close friends take h2 econs though,btohqsg
is either H1 or they take some Yee yee humanities like me,btohqsg
Yea bro end of year project was to cook curry chicken. My team ended up serving raw potatoes+ get this,btohqsg
Dump in hot water then took it out  peeled and cut it,btohqsg
Our curry chicken was canned  we cooked it but apparently we cooked nothing,btohqsg
Why u dump the whole thing????,btohqsg
I want to do h3 yapperology,btohqsg
Idk we thought boiling water softens the skin,btohqsg
Meanwhile randkmdkd can somehow absorb and understand Econs knowledge just like that,btohqsg
My friend almost made the worst decision in history of that curry chicken meal,btohqsg
He said it would stand out  he wanted to put ice around it,btohqsg
I bet if he were to sit for an Econs a level paper now without having sat in a single Econs class he can get at least a B,btohqsg
The only edible shit on that plate was the sauce,btohqsg
But tbh no man‚Ä¶econs like need write long essays,btohqsg
I was like Aight no econs,btohqsg
I mean wanted to stand out ü§£,btohqsg
Cause she always say how econs is difficult but she cannot drop to h1,btohqsg
cause her math is alr h1,btohqsg
Then she say she regret not taking H2 Lit,btohqsg
Hey at least my team did not fucked up as bad as the worse team,btohqsg
He took PCMG but I think he alr understands quite a bit of Econs just from hearing others talk about it lol,btohqsg
Cook noodles ah...don't know how come can cook into a ball,btohqsg
no thats cause im the only pcmg student in my fren grp so when my friends are studying econs i normally just listen to them talk,btohqsg
Then nvm  presentation time. The team want to add sauce. It's a cabonara pasta horh,btohqsg
cuz the subject that i would be studying would be chem/geog when im listening to them,btohqsg
my tablemates both h1 econs so I listen to what theysay and can kinda understand a bit,btohqsg
PLS TELL ME YOU ARE JOKING,btohqsg
Hot mushroom sauce mixing with cold fish sauce,btohqsg
Ya but you didn‚Äôt even sit through an econs class but can alr understand and absorb stuff just from listening to them talk  whereas most others who don‚Äôt do econs probably would not absorb anything that easily,btohqsg
I know econs got market failure,btohqsg
the chesse already salty as fk u still want to put fish sauce legend,btohqsg
Emergency room right there  don't need eat for the next day alr..everything eat will come out,btohqsg

All the more impressive what  you got all your Econs knowledge in less than 5 months just from hearing your friends. Meanwhile you said you had a friend who didn‚Äôt know the difference between demand and quantity demanded even right up till As,btohqsg
For tm h1 geog how many chers do yall get,btohqsg
My sch also 2 for h1 geog,btohqsg
Actually there were 3 chers but one left for a pri sch,btohqsg
So only 2 left for both h1 and h2,btohqsg
So tm geog department has how many chers,btohqsg
For me it‚Äôs 2 chers for both batches,btohqsg
I thought TM geog dept is small,btohqsg
And doesn‚Äôt help that the only decent geog Cher left is probably retiring soon,btohqsg
Cuz the chers follow all the way from j1 to 2 by right,btohqsg
It‚Äôs normal for schs to have only around 3 geog chers,btohqsg
Acjc for h1 history one batch only has one Cher,btohqsg
Whereas h2 get 2 Cher‚Äôs per batch,btohqsg
Idk for h1 but h2 should be 40-50,btohqsg
never eaten pepperlunch i nmy life,btohqsg
Maybe like 90 students in total including h1?,btohqsg
So for Acjc it‚Äôs rly bad,btohqsg
