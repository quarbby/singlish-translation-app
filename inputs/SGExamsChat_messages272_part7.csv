Even the one that can go to top jc wants to go to poly,btohqsg

Every where u go there is still competition,btohqsg
Yea it's called the Singapore education system,btohqsg
Less ppl competing with u thou,btohqsg
Doesn't make the content any less harder,btohqsg
Wait A levels got Bell curve,btohqsg
I mean even if fewer candidate  there is still competition.Take F math for example lor.,btohqsg
How many student actually got A?,btohqsg
Everyone in F math should be pretty good at math.,btohqsg
Of course competition will be tight.,btohqsg
Well then ur A  B  C  D  E  U range all change HAHAHAH,btohqsg
competitive but easier to do well opposed to previous years (ironically),btohqsg
"actually its not ironic  because democratic educational systems eventually lead to overall ""grade inflation""",btohqsg
I am getting vv conflicting info,btohqsg
compare A lvl results in 1980s vs now,btohqsg
in 1980s u dont hear of 40% dist rate for H2 Chem,btohqsg
of course some can correct me on this,btohqsg
possible  but if u look at other educational systems  is a result of democracy and potential grade inflation,btohqsg
"governments cant possibly continuously publish ""worse off"" results consistently or else it will go to show that the ""education system has failed""",btohqsg
Ik they cut down content but like,btohqsg
According to my lecturers at least ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
its a UK example  but its somewhat relevant to our education system,btohqsg
Hmmm wait so r the questions easier or,btohqsg
"Just that they ""pump up"" the stats",btohqsg
"i wont say questions are easier for sure  definitely now its ""harder"" simply because more application based questions are appearing in exams  but in reality most of these questions are simply testing on content covered in the syllabus  do difficulty overall is still moderate.",btohqsg
but honestly at least for chem as an a lvl subject  last yr's covid cohort performance was poorer overall,btohqsg
but it seems like there was a severe inflation due to COVID,btohqsg
Wonder how the 1990s questions looked,btohqsg
Feel free to send me:') I'm quite curious,btohqsg
