Hi Gurus I plan to open HSBC EGA in 1st Jun 2024.Kindly enlighten me if my understanding is correct as below:HSBC EGA got 2 Promo Interest:1. Bonus Interest Promo for 3.3%.2. HSBC Everyday+ Rewards for additional 1%.Total will be 4.35% (3.3+1+0.05 original interest)To get the Bonus Interest 3.3%  we need to SMS to register and keep the fund 2 mths such as Jun and July 2024. So  rightfully  the Bonus Interest will be credited by 30 Sep 2024  and in 1st August 2024  I can actually transfer all out to another bank.Then to get the additional 1% Interest  we need to fund transfer in 2k and can transfer out immediately to another 5 non-hsbc accounts. But this 1% only can get for 1 mth which is Jun 2024. July 2024 won't hv.Correct?,btohqsg
Yeah  in general your understanding is correct. Just that no need to immediately transfer out after transfer in 2K. You can take your time Another point is Interest for 2 will arrive earlier than 1  so no need to panic if you receive less than expected.,btohqsg
I thought the promotion is until end June only (01May to 30Jun2024)? Is there a new one ? Thanks,btohqsg
1. need to see if there is new promo in Jun.2. u get 1% on incremental monthly average balance wrt previous month for each month  if july mab is lower or same than jun mab then no 1% interest for jul,btohqsg
