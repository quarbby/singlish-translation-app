Wash last light then tonight rain ü´†,btohqsg
does the auto wash scratch your paint bro,btohqsg
won't be cleaner than our temple of wash's wash,btohqsg
10 for man wash  7 for machine wash,btohqsg
Dont think so  auto wash is fully touchless,btohqsg
oh! cool ill check it out,btohqsg
Machine wash  u may as well roll your car in the sand,btohqsg
I like it that way ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
My eye pain just looking at it lol,btohqsg
I needed to zoom In to see the noise level  and combine level of road surface and over sharpen hurts my eyes,btohqsg
Sure. And you are not going to get the appeal of others. Liking thing is one thing but if your photo does not appeal to others. There is no point sharing it for views or not receptive to comments.It like how mobile phones are already doing the best they can to appeal to the masses. Not looking too sharp or too bright. Flaunt all they want but if the photo is too sharp and too over saturated and not true to life. No one will buy that phone for it.,btohqsg
Still got pic of what I shot that time at tuas ? Mind sending it here ?,btohqsg
I'm just sharing. And it's mainly for memories. I do accept opinions of everyone. But still  I like my pictures that way hahaha,btohqsg
Then I‚Äôm not sure if it is a good place to be uploading to multiple group chat for MEMORIES.,btohqsg
BEST to keep it to your self la if it is for memories.,btohqsg
Sharing is good for the car community,btohqsg
Show me what is your standard,btohqsg
I mean. Sure not a pro shot. But spotters take clearer and cleaner shots.,btohqsg
Too bright cannot. Too dark also cannot hahahah,btohqsg
This is such a fun community,btohqsg
hope this helps if you want to find your own sweet spot,btohqsg
Done. Hope u guys don't need to see the doctor üôÇ,btohqsg
That why must balance Light and shadows!,btohqsg
Aiya I forward this in here lah,btohqsg
It's better than my photos last time hahaha.. so do pardon me,btohqsg
Plus I'm using a lousy phone,btohqsg
Phone not really the issue  its more of the the settings,btohqsg
burst mode and cars going at 120-150 hence cant center it well LOL,btohqsg
But ya. My suggestion. Too sharp. Esp if you use phone Ah  you can bring those sliders to extreme unless you shoot RAW.Phone sensors makes quite a diff  if you use Android it not easy. iPhone also not the best but it gives better results for editing.,btohqsg
If you are editing JPG  honestly you cannot apply much effects or edits!,btohqsg
Ok maybe cr2 as well hahahah,btohqsg
Of course I'm accepting their opinions hehe  if not why else would I post it here,btohqsg
You can try shoot RAW on Android. But having tried. The results are hard.,btohqsg
On android camera there is something called Pro mode  you can play around with settings,btohqsg
However not all settings can be played with,btohqsg
This was RAW shot on the iPhone. Dark setting with light from the top.,btohqsg
What GOOD RAW let‚Äôs you do. You can control much more. So I can change the lights perfectly without affecting others.,btohqsg
Okay but you send it here. It will not be RAW anymore.,btohqsg
Sadly yes  unless you compress the file,btohqsg
All the photos I sent are processed already. All JPG or whatever lossy format.,btohqsg
I got more photos in my tablet lol  and lazy send here  those people who shoot with me before  know my work lol  I don't need to comment much lol,btohqsg
So with JPG.  Not much you can do really cause you lose a lot of finer controls but editable but Very limited.So for this shot. A quick edit for you.Basically the temperature is made cooler  shadows around 16% more and black point. Specifically adjust colors but limited. White levels too. 1PX sharpening with 20% intensity,btohqsg
So I bring out silvers as the main colors of the shot.,btohqsg
My suggestion is brining a light for a shoot,btohqsg
Can get what I always use  the nightcore slc10  1x alone is already good enough plus price for it is like less then 150  plus its a portable charger  aka 2 in 1,btohqsg
@teamprestigejemmaybe if you wanna  go save up for a camera  if you like taking photo  it's a good investment,btohqsg
I started out taking photo with a phone so I feel your pain,btohqsg
True! I mean. You can shoot with phone but it is a uphill battle. You will be limited cause phone will struggle to catch light at low light shots. And even different phones makes very different results. Personally I challenged myself to shoot my stuff on my iPhones only but yeah you can‚Äôt do quite a lot of that camera can do. BUT better modern mobile phones do give great processed photos that you do not need to edit.@teamprestigejem,btohqsg
Can out-rightfully tell my wife I come geylang eat Ë±ÜËÖê now.,btohqsg
Another reason to go geylang xP,btohqsg
This my only reason. Lol. If not@chloetherx8might say otherwise,btohqsg

U do have a tendency to make unreadable posters. Contrast with the background is critical. If the poster subject matter is complex then add a frame or caption beneath the image,btohqsg
