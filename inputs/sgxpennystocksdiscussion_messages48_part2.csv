You must be an independent thinker to become a real trader!You should NEVER EVER ask another trader crucial  personal and strategy-specific questions like ‚Äúhow should I move my stop loss‚Äù  ‚Äúwhen do you take profit‚Äù  ‚Äúwhich indicator is the best for entries‚Äù  ‚Äúhow much money do I need and how much can I make‚Äù  ‚Äúwhich timeframe is the best‚Äù or ‚Äúis my indicator setting wrong‚Äù...First  you don‚Äôt know the other trader's objections and  most importantly  he has no idea how you trade  he does not know your full approach  how you execute your trades and what your struggles are. At best  the answers you get are then totally meaningless and destructive in the worst case!By asking the questions above  traders hope to gain clarity and remove the doubts they have. However  when the answers you get are not correct and you start making changes to your trading that result in more losses  you will end up worse off.You artificially created hope and certainty by asking random traders and your hopes then got crushed once you saw that your results didn‚Äôt improve your performance. Then you are back to square one and many traders end up trading with a Frankenstein-like system where the individual concepts don‚Äôt fit and it creates bad trading results because a trader doesn‚Äôt know how to operate it.-From FB,btohqsg
Physician say he was diagnosed 72 hours ago. WTF!!!!!!!! So when actually he kana covid-19,btohqsg
Maybe medical stock will reverse down ü§îü§îü§î,btohqsg
72 hours ago from the live update just now at 11+pm = he was diagnosed on wed night SG time. They kept under wraps until multiple repeat tests confirm positive.,btohqsg
I watched the live update by his physician. seems like he was trying to siam some questions that the reporters asked,btohqsg
anyway  the critical period is day 1-10  especially day 7-10. Have to see how it goes the next few days. Boris Johnson initially also only mild symptoms but later go ICU.,btohqsg
DT's doctors seem to be very aggressive in treating him though. multi-prong treatment,btohqsg
I am listening to ABC News live stream (https://abcnews.go.com/Live). ABC's White House correspondent mentioned this. The physician update just now made it sound all rosy.,btohqsg
Seeing the event where guests mingled freely without masks n social distancing  they deserved it.,btohqsg

Nothing is sure but the risk might be worth taking now. Those whom bought the stocks at much higher price may be trapped but the current price seems unlikely. Especially TG  RS which the bosses themselves bought back just slightly below the current price. No risk no gain ya. And now is the time to take this risk. üòÅ,btohqsg
VP is speculation. TG  RS  UG & MT are no longer speculation. Results proven & will be better,btohqsg
My own opinion. Aspen cannot buy. üòÅ,btohqsg

I only those I mentioned to you,btohqsg
When you say VP speculation that's why I ask your opinion on all these also ma,btohqsg
