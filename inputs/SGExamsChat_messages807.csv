idk isnâ€™t ucc for like health issues,btohqsg
Iâ€™m saying all these with 0Hours of sleep,btohqsg
Don't tell me this is it,btohqsg
Great placement tho put it near all the highest intensity and high likelihood of injury places,btohqsg
Omg my japan depression is that bad that im actually tryna find a job in japanese companyðŸ’€,btohqsg
Coz those are like not pharma related or not entry level,btohqsg
Is Japan even known for Pharm? I cannot think of any Pharm Companies in Japan ngl,btohqsg
In sg i think there is only hisamitsu and takeda,btohqsg
Ok but my parents will probably be like ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ if i decide to join sth else coz my degree and suffering wasted,btohqsg
I dun think ANA has customer service in singapore coz their english customer service is in US and philipines,btohqsg
Those are like blended with traditional medicine too ngl,btohqsg
No such thing as a wasted degree imo,btohqsg
It's just how you choose to use your degree.. I mean like if u branch into business it still won't be wasted as the knowledge u learnt still would be useful in those jobs.,btohqsg
True if it is well payed,btohqsg
Yeah basically how useful u wan your degree to be depends on you,btohqsg
But usually if u want to branch out fr ur degree speciality  u need some experience firstâ€¦a fresh degree wun land u those jobs,btohqsg
I even on alert for japanese companies job lol,btohqsg
Internship in their industry u wanna branch out to,btohqsg
Or take a hit with a slightly more entry level position,btohqsg
Then Pivot based on job experience,btohqsg
Tbh entry level position hard to find,btohqsg
Yeah ill admit that too as ppl don't wanna pay dip level for degree level as u will be overqualified,btohqsg
So i also dunno how to find,btohqsg
I am not qualified to give advice on such matters ngl. Most of this chat still in infancy too so Full Time Job Seeking is not in their priorities rn as well,btohqsg
Why would you want to find a job in Japan? Salaries are lower than in Singapore  which is exacerbated by the recent devaluation of the yen. Taxes are higher  too. Work culture is even more toxic than in Singapore.,btohqsg
I mean japan companies in singapore,btohqsg
Oh yea i heard about japanese being overworked,btohqsg
But it is hard to find entry level,btohqsg
You have to send tons of resumes out,btohqsg
I know people who applied to 150 roles and got only 5 interviews,btohqsg
And he is probably lucky to even have 5 interviews,btohqsg
All the jobs i come across requires a few yrs of experience,btohqsg
150 is legit on the lower side of the scale. some people apply to much more,btohqsg
In pharma i think the most entry level role is sales but i dun think i fit that roleðŸ’€,btohqsg
You really have to sit down for a fortnight or so and dedicate yourself 100% to getting a job,btohqsg
Please don't restrict yourself to pharma. Look at management trainee positions too  for example,btohqsg
"Your degree isn't ""wasted""  university is not a vocational institution where you are prepared for a single one-track career path. University is meant to broaden your mind.",btohqsg
It is more of i think for entry level  maybe it will be easier to use ur degree coz some of those other roles may need some degree qualification,btohqsg
That may not be true. Many roles actually don't care what your actual degree is in.,btohqsg
True coz im p sure ppl will be bored if they do the same shit for 30y,btohqsg
Ah ic maybe i will just need to scroll linkedin and find any suitable jobs,btohqsg
Yes. Precisely. You can consider roles in consulting  management  even tech.,btohqsg
But my parents hv been telling me not to give up so easily on securing a licensing trg placement,btohqsg
nah  pharma as a career is overrated  most people drop out of it anyway,btohqsg
Chase the money  not a piece of paper that doesn't necessarily lead to money.,btohqsg
Im open to that but my parents wun be supportive in me branching away fr pharma,btohqsg
Your life is your own. When they are gone  you have to fend for yourself,btohqsg
"In the end  they will still be proud of you despite you not going along with their ""preferred"" career path for you",btohqsg
Sometimes people have tunnel vision when they get a degree in a certain specialty. They think they must get a job in those lines. Don't fall for it.,btohqsg
It is more of they dun want me to â€˜wasteâ€™ my degree aft seeing how i suffered in uni to even graduate,btohqsg
Not really their preferred career path for me,btohqsg
Didn't u choose your degree also based on the ideal of not wasting your RP or was it someone else?,btohqsg
It is more of a waste if you end up unemployed or in a role which is related to your degree but does not exploit your full potential.,btohqsg
Tbh this is what Alot of older folks advice the younger ones  but being in that time of life is really makes a difference. She still at the point of life where most of her expenses are paid for by her parents,btohqsg
You ended up in your degree program by chance. Don't leave your future to chance.,btohqsg
You get a salary when you get a job. If that job isn't what they want it to be  you can pay for yourself.,btohqsg
"I work at a university  so I have a birds eye view of these things. The most successful graduates end up doing something that is not the ""typical"" career path expected of people from their program. By definition  if you have a ""typical"" career  you will end up being a forgettable ""typical"" person.",btohqsg
(I must stress  these opinions are my own  not of any other person or entity I am affiliated with),btohqsg
For most people they have to balance the fine line between actually not letting their parents down but also not letting themselves down.When your parents spend half their life savings to put you through a standard or path  it's very tough to ignore that factor and not give that more piriority over one's believes or aspirations.Unless the certainty of your believes or aspirations validates talent that one may already have,btohqsg
Well  parents need to have more realistic expectations. University takes time. 4 years is a long time for an industry to go from boom to bust. You can't expect to commit to a specific career 4 years in advance when the jobs may no longer be there when you graduate. Which is why many employers hire people without too much regard for their actual degree.,btohqsg
I need to learn how not to stick things to the book because if things go haywire like now  i dunno how to get out of it nd find other solutions,btohqsg
"Yeah that's your problem gotta stop with the ideal of the kiasu ""need to maximise everything I get"" kinda mentality",btohqsg
Yea and im at the stage where i need to seek advice but also knowing perhaps my parents may not be that useful in that sense coz 1) they are not pharma bg tho my mum works in pharma company 2) they hv a path right in front of then when they graduate coz they were psc scholars,btohqsg
If u do so can your really argue that u have free will and are an independent agent? Because that mentality leaves u basically at the whims of what the masses want.,btohqsg
Talk to your jc friends in courses like business. Seek their perspective. Also  consider what industries are the most promising in Singapore. Pharma is probably not one of them. But the most promising industries would probably hire a suitable candidate with a pharma degree  too.,btohqsg
You are not defined by your degree. If you really feel constrained by it  get a masters. But you don't have to.,btohqsg
Actually this is v true and things can change in a blink of an eye as well and perhaps like what u mentioned there is no such thing as â€˜fixed career pathâ€™,btohqsg
Yea and my mum told me it is as good as i did not graduate fr pharmacy sch if i dun get a pharmacy license  but omo if things goes rong  there is always a solution to it,btohqsg
Precisely. University is meant to broaden your perspective  improve the breadth of your knowledge but also the depth of your knowledge in your discipline. But at the end of the day  it should not be a blinker that commits you to an unsustainable career path  trudging along in a dead end job till you retire...,btohqsg
They have to but that does not mean they want to. So many parents tend to push their child to limits that are on the verge of using filial piety as a negotiating or bargaining tool and that basically results in the child not having any say.Like one of my friends right now  die die parents want him to go overseas uni. Will pay for all his expenses but I'm very sure he does not want it. Such a hard bargain  how to balance,btohqsg
Last I heard the majority of students who graduate from Law school didn't not end up getting called to the bar. So it really doesn't matter what major u did as it is just the conception of the subjects u learnt that culminates in the awarding of a degree.,btohqsg
Yea i dun even think there is a local pharma companyðŸ’€,btohqsg
honestly  parents' opinions should have no bearing on musician right now. they are graduated  and are more than capable of getting a job and paying their own bills  even without parents' support.,btohqsg
Lemme just say it this way from my perspective and logic. Because I did 2 years in RP doing my diploma in Biomedical Science but drop out for NTU meaning I don't get my Diploma. Does this mean I have learnt nothing or I wasted my 2 years?,btohqsg
That is pretty much most poly diplomas  if you don't advance to uni. Especially in the science field  you basically got a diploma that is diw,btohqsg
What they should consider is the following; what is the best move I can make right now for my career?,btohqsg
If pharma can be ruled out  musician should drop pharma like a hot potato,btohqsg
True but sounds like in the back of her mind  she still wants to somewhat value her parents wishes,btohqsg
My parents hv mentioned overseas uni many many times but i still chose to do it locally coz they did not give me any assurance that they will not leave me there alone and ya i miss familyðŸ’€,btohqsg
well  she shouldn't. it will be a bad decision. one that may end up pulling her apart from her parents when things don't go as planned,btohqsg
psc scholars have a very perculiar view of the world. At the age of 18 they are given a pamphlet which shows them exactly how they will progress in their career  the number of years of work that will get them emplaced at a certain job level  etc etc. Everything is planned out till retirement. Most people don't have that sort of certainty,btohqsg
Therefore  they are uniquely placed to give uniquely bad advice to musician,btohqsg
Welp as I said it's easy to say but many people take years to overcome this hurdle  the pressure and the knowledge that your very own parents could have spend 1/3 or even half their life savings on you to go down a path they alr planned out eats at you every single day,btohqsg
relax  they are psc scholars  op's nus degree is not gonna cost them half of life savings ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Amount spent is still rather large tbf,btohqsg
It is not really â€˜value my parents wishesâ€™. Tbh pharmacy was my choice back then (becoz of what i mentioned previously of not wasting my rp)It is more of1) hving seen me suffered completing uni  my parents kinda want me to stay in pharma  in fact my mum told me not to give up tryna to get the license so easily (fyi i basically failed 6 interviews so idk why it is called â€˜give up easilyâ€™)2) if i want to branch out to other things  at this point im still tryna figure out where to go  what i want and whether they accept entry level in the first place (tbh i kinda am v unproductive when coming to things i dun really like doing such as interviews and job seeking coz it is damn mundane),btohqsg
Yes  but not enough to blind musician to alternative  possibly better career paths,btohqsg
Otherwise op would have fallen for the classic sunk cost fallacy,btohqsg
Maybe that is why my parents hv been lucky  instead of them finding for jobs  the jobs find them,btohqsg
Yes. But that also means you should take their advice with a grain of salt,btohqsg
Nah if she had  she won't be thinking of her life right now fr,btohqsg
Tbh for a typical degree  aft moeâ€™s subsidy of 0%  it is still not that bad,btohqsg
40k a sem? Is it can't rmb,btohqsg
Where got. More like 40k for all 4 years  including hall,btohqsg
Oh maybe I thinking priv lol,btohqsg
No after subsidy mine is $9k per yr,btohqsg
Yeah  so it's not even that big of a sunk cost.,btohqsg
40k i can go australia international rateðŸ’€,btohqsg
3k per yr more than poly,btohqsg
40k per sem is probably close to ivy league rates,btohqsg
(if it's tuition alone  that is),btohqsg
I know my friendâ€™s dad pay ard $40k idk per sem or yr for australia doctor degree,btohqsg
Problem is idk if after grad how coz her australia degree probs not recognised in sg,btohqsg
Are Singapore doctors paid the highest in the world,btohqsg
By no means! US doctors paid way more ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Every few days I hear Americans complaining how come most American hospitals with basic amenities are private,btohqsg
That's not due to doctors' pay though. It's cos of the following graph:,btohqsg
Way too many administrators doing busywork adding to the overheads,btohqsg
That one is like American rates ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Oh you mean the ones behind the counters,btohqsg
Behind the counters  behind the scenes  insurance adjusters  etc etc,btohqsg
Way to many people employed in healthcare who do jackshit,btohqsg
So much manpower and their hospitals get regular lighting and water outages,btohqsg
As I have always said. Why be a doctor having to waste so much time in getting a license when u get to be the administrator and practise medicine still just without a license,btohqsg
It's not like the doctors will be able to do what they want without you. They can recommend surgery but u are the one who gatekeeps the funds.,btohqsg
Isit true that taking the ambulance in the us will cost 1k,btohqsg
Btw a while back I did some maths and came to the conclusions of basically hoe business works in america,btohqsg
Yes  and even more in some cases. Which is why you see injured people jumping out of ambulances.,btohqsg
Can't afford the ride  they'd rather take an uber to hospital after traffic accidents ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
People legit get bankrupted by ambulance rides,btohqsg
Do you think this calculation is valid ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
The picture is not very accurate. You must consider the people who are employed skimming off the top of the system,btohqsg
The US insurance adjustment system is very convoluted.,btohqsg
To accomodate  naturally  a similarly convoluted regulatory system and internal revenue code,btohqsg
Don't forget the jobs that bring the votes!,btohqsg
At least I was close? I guess,btohqsg
Remember  1 percent of the us workforce are insurance adjusters,btohqsg
At least that is how I concluded hospitals making money,btohqsg
Btw a ambulance just have to take 90 patients and they can make back enough to buy a new ambulance that can operate for 10yrs,btohqsg
It is as much about keeping people employed and happy as it is about profit.,btohqsg
Some poor people don't mind it though  cos they are already bankrupt  can't hurt them anymore â˜ ,btohqsg
In the us all you have to do once you are bankcrupt is start doing insurance scams,btohqsg
The moment one of them sticks  you will get some moolah,btohqsg
If u are injured  wun u prioritise getting treated over money,btohqsg
That won't work. If you're bankrupt  your credit score is gone  no one will sell you insurance in the first place,btohqsg
ad nauseum. the us is #1 for people jumping out of ambulances,btohqsg
Oh yea btw have you also heard about how if a major corporation vehicle strikes you or causes you to crash  you can settle for very large settlement,btohqsg
depends on the skill of your personal injury lawyer,btohqsg
If you are in an accident  lawyers proactively seek you out,btohqsg
"They will represent you for ""free""  but take a % of your judgement/settlement",btohqsg
Idk if it's true but there a rumor going around telling people to brakecheck trucks where the drivers have a tendency to look at their phones owned by coca cola  FedEx  ups etc,btohqsg
Once struck  they can call for a out of court settlement and usually these settlements pay way more than court settlements,btohqsg
Depends on the jury too  really.,btohqsg
And the state your accident occurs in.,btohqsg
But yeah  an out of court settlement ends up being cheaper for everyone,btohqsg
Yep  now that's one of those ka-ching juries who award massive damages,btohqsg
Big pay day for the lawyer  probably,btohqsg
3 people dead but damn all the victims family caught a windfall,btohqsg
Lawyer probably took home more than the family. Typically the case with these things,btohqsg
ðŸ’€ The us really is a joke of a place,btohqsg
My mum told me her first job interview had 6 stages before they offered herðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
but that's for psc scholarship  right?,btohqsg
But for now what to worry is finding a job first,btohqsg
No her first job after her bond,btohqsg
I think it was finance / accounting,btohqsg
6 rounds is not atypical. But most companies don't do that  I think.,btohqsg
Especially not for a entry level job  really,btohqsg
Your mom must have been gunning for middle management/executive-level roles,btohqsg
I think the hard thing is to find entry level positions,btohqsg
Coz afterwards it will be easier to find a job,btohqsg
Her 6 stages one was entry level entry actually,btohqsg
Naw  most people end up in entry level positions. After all  you have to start from one  right?,btohqsg
Just cast a wide net and take any job that offers decent compensation  really.,btohqsg
Yea but finding the job is hard coz most of it need at least 3y experience,btohqsg
I can assure you that most experiences will not be like this,btohqsg
Because i actually hv some interview phobia so i really need to overcome it,btohqsg
I can give you a mock interview haha,btohqsg
The last successful interview i had was in j2 (actually that is prolly a pull string lol),btohqsg
Coz one of the interviewers is my past teacher and ofc he liked me,btohqsg
MCA (i think this award is no longer given),btohqsg
My friend has suggested i go for psychotherapy to help w my social anxiety issues but my parents hvnt been supportive in me going for therapy sessions,btohqsg
Yo nf these days Alot of bus accidents horh,btohqsg
And also she told me her sessions were $100-200 per hourly session,btohqsg
Psychotherapy isn't gonna help  probably. You need to go out and meet people. I find attending conferences very helpful. Walk up to someone during teatime and start talking,btohqsg
Or just go up to a poster and talk to the guy who is presenting the poster,btohqsg
Best way to overcome social anxiety is using the brute force technique,btohqsg
It is more of learning how to switch personalities at the right time  my friend said it helped her but she went for those sessions for 6mðŸ’€,btohqsg
But different ppl will see different impact,btohqsg
I'm always open to giving people interview simulations - of course  you can also approach your school career office and they would probably be more than happy to walk you through a typical interview,btohqsg
well  that's the case at my school  anyway,btohqsg
Whenever I have to go through a new experience  I just think what is the worst possible outcome,btohqsg
Everytime I do that  magically my anxiety will be lessen,btohqsg
For now i need to cross the first hurdle of landing me in a reasonable job,btohqsg
And also  recently i kinda like the aviation industry,btohqsg
go for it  sia/cag are great places to work,btohqsg
I got a friend in aerospace eng  I jokes with her about watching plane accidents being fun,btohqsg
Unfortunately i dun meet cabin crew height requirementsðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Aviation industry is more than just cabin crew ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Eh musician become customer service officer,btohqsg
The logistics side of aviation alone is a huge employer,btohqsg
Yea singapore airlines has a lot of roles,btohqsg
In fact their linkedin posts are kinda new,btohqsg
For instance; developing algorithms like SkySolver to help airlines deal with irregular operations (technical faults  weather),btohqsg
There are other companies as well  rolls Royce  Boeing  Airbus,btohqsg
Software for routing baggage to the right places and right airlines.,btohqsg
I tot those are us based?,btohqsg
Royce has maintenance near seletar airport,btohqsg
Airbus is at changi airfreight terminal,btohqsg
SIAEC is a well established MRO for Boeing and Airbus aircraft.,btohqsg
So many jobs in aviation in Singapore,btohqsg
And with T5 in the horizon  it's going to play an even bigger role in our economy.,btohqsg
Ngl but cabin crew is prob the golden job at airports,btohqsg
Freight followers idk if that what you call them have the best job in aviation,btohqsg
Nah  the tech bros working on ops research probably have the highest pay packets :),btohqsg
I'm a tech guy  so probably not.,btohqsg
Basically someone that is employed to follow freight in the belly of a aircraft from one country to another  something like logistics but you have to bring you passport 24/7 but every trip pays in thousands,btohqsg
Ah  like a loadmaster in the air force but better paid,btohqsg
Heard one of my father's friend  he said that no matter what she was doing  she had to fly then and there within 1hr,btohqsg
She could be having dinner with friends or family  she had to leave Singapore within 1hr+,btohqsg
Follow expensive cargo across the world  she quit after 5 yrs. Sounds like a literally dream,btohqsg
But the reason why it's so lucrative is because you can't be hired through any agency or website or even as a job,btohqsg
It's a word of mouth adhoc job,btohqsg
Then it's not something musician is looking for  she probably wants something non-adhoc,btohqsg
Would i look stupid if i grad fr pharma and go into working for singapore airlines or cag,btohqsg
No  you won't be the only one,btohqsg
True but yes just saying that,btohqsg
Coz tbh i got interested in aviation industry aft i started travelling again post-covid,btohqsg
Better get a pharma degree and work for them straight away rather than wasting time in pharma for a few years and end up working for them in a entry level job anyway in 5 years,btohqsg
Got people doctorade become sec school teacher,btohqsg
There's like so many different jobs u gotta be specific.,btohqsg
Again  most pharma people in SG quit pharma,btohqsg
I got a friend in pharma now  he's trying to venture out to other parts of the industry like radiology,btohqsg
A lot of ppl just say eh I wanna go into this industry but like what kind? For example finance got the analyst  executive or sales,btohqsg
So it is btr to start entry level elsewhere  rather than do pharma then quit and need to start entry level again,btohqsg
Tbh i kinda like customer service,btohqsg
But idk if it is paying well,btohqsg
Ngl this incline and the fact you said air stewardess makes me believe you want to do something related to interaction within the airline industry,btohqsg
The fact you also want to eventually overcome your social anxiety gives this probability even more weight,btohqsg
Im not gonna not believe that coz i experienced it,btohqsg
Any customer or client facing job u have to be ready to get fucked/harassed daily cuz it's part of the job,btohqsg
But somehow i like to be in the frontline,btohqsg
Yea and needing to know how to face unreasonable customers,btohqsg
When you getting your pilot license,btohqsg
Just basically taking it in and saying sir I understand how you feel,btohqsg
Or you can be the flight engineer,btohqsg
Actually i ever thought of becoming an air stewardess,btohqsg
But too bad i dun qualify,btohqsg
I think Alot of girls do,btohqsg
Most flight schools have a height requirement for ATPL,btohqsg
I mean idk what to say,btohqsg
Like I think air stewardess is one of those jobs that most girls yearn to get,btohqsg
So sadly that is not sth in my choices now,btohqsg
Oh is it  i tot it is just meðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Paid to travel the world even if it's for a few short hrs or days at a time,btohqsg
Overseas airlines accept 1.57m for female pilots though,btohqsg
Look at how many applications for stewardess compared to steward you know alr,btohqsg
You can always work for SIA in management trainee or similar roles,btohqsg
ANA steward is not even on their planes  they deployed as ground staffðŸ’€,btohqsg
It's ok  maybe can be flight engineer ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Flight engineer is no longer a thing after fly-by-wire,btohqsg
go for it. you have to start somewhere,btohqsg
management trainee is a good thing because they are investing in you as an employee,btohqsg
(+ singapore airlines bonus is huge),btohqsg
+ Singapore airlines on resume is chef's kiss,btohqsg
One of my friends tried to apply for Singapore airlines laboratory personell,btohqsg
He got accepted but he could not past the last interview,btohqsg
I think she needs to say no more,btohqsg
I'm tryna get a scholarship there,btohqsg
they promote you quickly because they have an internal need to justify the initial investment.,btohqsg
I told my parents i want to work for Singapore Airlines and they were like â€˜this is the consequence of bringing me overseasâ€™,btohqsg
Wait if my a lvl rabak I can use o lvl right,btohqsg
Coz sq jobs are mostly entry level i can go fr A levels,btohqsg
sia is legit a good employer though,btohqsg
Singapore airlines can apply through o levels as well,btohqsg
Alot of stewardess apply through their o levels,btohqsg
and no  they have jobs for degree holders too,btohqsg
I mean they already know i like to fly and love SQ and ANA,btohqsg
unless you really wanna go for ground staff/stewardess/baggage handler,btohqsg
But they were more of they dun pay 4y of my uni for this,btohqsg
I can tell u most jobs are usually what is seen as boring. Like administrators,btohqsg
But it's required and got opening usually,btohqsg
Tbh I think Alot of stewardess or stewards get into the job because their family situation would not have allowed them to travel the world,btohqsg
Got any more SIA job positions I can apply,btohqsg
So they use that precise job to do that,btohqsg
catering staff  ground staff  laboratory staffGot license can drive vehicles like the emas vehicle,btohqsg
Im just scared my parents will throw eggs at me,btohqsg
this is their version of a management trainee program,btohqsg
a path to management-level positions in sia,btohqsg
a really sweet deal  if you can get in,btohqsg
Basically my parents is of the thinking that the degree is wasted and they spent 4y of uni for nth,btohqsg
Lmao make scrambled eggs and serve them  tell them it's Singapore airlines special,btohqsg
But again it is my life  my work,btohqsg
they have blinkers on. a pharma degree doesn't mean you have to do pharma. having a one-track mind turns a degree into a liability rather than an asset,btohqsg
It is not sth new that i hv brought up to them that i like the aviation industry,btohqsg
I think working with SIA will be Lit tbh,btohqsg
Like I love working with planes,btohqsg
That's basically what I said since the start  you are still trying to get over the reality that your parents really spent a bunch of their money on you so you have to process something of worth to them,btohqsg
But st the same time balancing your own interest and dreams for your own future,btohqsg
But now they are saying it is a consequence of bringing me overseas,btohqsg
To peak my interest even more,btohqsg
It is  that's why alot of ppl apply for sia,btohqsg
It is not just that but my parents are the typical over-controlling ones,btohqsg
I mean im not the only one w a uni degree that looks to join sia,btohqsg
And like I said they are using filial piety and other aspect of your life as a negotiating and bargaining tool,btohqsg
One of my snrs grad fr life sci applied to air stewardess  sth that just needs O / A levels qualifications,btohqsg
they literally have a program  especially for university graduates. your parents must be mad if they think an organisation like sia doesn't need highly educated degree holders for certain jobs,btohqsg
There are 19 yr old sia stewardess flying right now,btohqsg
I can convince my dad but not my mum,btohqsg
My dad is more lax than my mum who just everything by the book,btohqsg
Ah yes the best civil servant,btohqsg
The one who follows the book,btohqsg
"As usually the dad seem like the happy go lucky kind of every family nowadays  tbf  most dad nowadays are the ""Your life"" kind",btohqsg
Your life  not my prob ðŸ’€,btohqsg
But my dad be like that is probably harder to get than pharma,btohqsg
But i mean if i never try  i will never know,btohqsg
The amount of applicants to sia is not just Singaporeans rmb that,btohqsg
And if i badly want sth  i will prob put in 100x effort,btohqsg
Do they open their management programme roles year round,btohqsg
My mum is basically on the mindset that she is paying for my pharma degree for nth,btohqsg
very sad that a psc scholar doesn't understand the value of a degree,btohqsg
She seems to be unable to discern the difference between a university and vocational training. That's all I can say,btohqsg
This one says graduates w 1-2y working experienceðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Yes internships count in work experience,btohqsg
yes  this role is specifically for people with less than 2 years of experience. quite the refreshing take from those requiring minimum years of experience  no?,btohqsg
I clicked and it gave me 145 jobs to choose frðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
lmk if you want a simulated interview for any of those positions. no judgement  you come in and out like any other interviewee at my place of work. down to asking the security guard for a guest pass...,btohqsg
I hate that portion of every new job,btohqsg
Waiting for the pass at the security,btohqsg
It's like you are the most clueless kid in the block and don't know where to wait or stand,btohqsg
I would think a big company like SIA would yield good returns,btohqsg
But typically do ppl ask for pay during the interviews,btohqsg
8 month's bonus for the past 2 years  no kidding,btohqsg
they ask for last drawn salary if you have working experience.,btohqsg
Lemme see which roles i wanna apply,btohqsg
But entry level jobs basically you take what they offer  no?,btohqsg
Maybe musician can take in the third round of 8 month bonus,btohqsg
My last drawn salary is kinda my mediocre intern salaryðŸ’€,btohqsg
don't mention it  if you get in sia will be your first job,btohqsg
They won't be so evil to give you intern pay,btohqsg
Apparently SIA has 2 rds for interview,btohqsg
First one is a video interview,btohqsg
If you got degree  always ask,btohqsg
Anything below degree just take it or leave it,btohqsg
The people I have interviewed typically don't ask about salary,btohqsg
This is for actual interviews  not simulated.,btohqsg
But there is some sort of understanding regarding last drawn,btohqsg
(which is why  by the way  you don't accept lowball offers for your first job),btohqsg
Usually only aft they get the job then the company will offer sth?,btohqsg
It will be on the offer letter,btohqsg
But I don't think it hurts to discuss compensation,btohqsg
Or at least  expectations for compensation,btohqsg
Sth interest me but it is 12h shift w night shift,btohqsg
What kind of shift is that,btohqsg
Don't they have 2-3 days of off,btohqsg
Or am I mistaken for another job,btohqsg
I believe the max is 44h a week,btohqsg
Off day every week cause last I've checked on shift jobs like these have at least 2 day off a week,btohqsg
the max only applies to jobs that fall under employment act. ie jobs paying less than 2.6k-ish,btohqsg
Is it weird to apply same company more than 1 job,btohqsg
In fact it's common but you have to check the HR policy of the company so listings have a caveat that says they only review your application as 1 common one,btohqsg
I told my mum i want apply SIA and she be like im not hving my priorities right,btohqsg
I mean at the end of the day a job is to give you pay and give your marni,btohqsg
better to suffer in agony or get permanent head damage,btohqsg
Why Si Yan did u choose permanent head damage,btohqsg
Actually he chose private hire driver,btohqsg
He can measure the thermodynamics of the tire for maximum efficiency in fuel consumption,btohqsg
the only thing I can think of is not just about career  but career longevity,btohqsg
What's the career lifespan of air stewardess?,btohqsg
But these days with the popularity of job hopping imo it's mitigated and an ancient theory liao,btohqsg
I keep seeing girls clip their wings 5-8 yrs or so into their careers,btohqsg
Air stewardess was once my dream job but i dun qualify lmao,btohqsg
no not related to job hopping,btohqsg
I mean SIAâ€™s ground staff jobs,btohqsg
Start at 20 end at 27 seem like the pivotal period of time for air stewardesses,btohqsg
Some go into their 30s but those are exceptions  the culture for flying is too toxic alr I've been hearing,btohqsg
no idea on thatif it pays well why not,btohqsg
Oh u mean the cyclical market or like the gig work itself?,btohqsg
I hv actually seen 30-40y/o stewardess on the flight before,btohqsg
u can always ask during interviews. It's a practical question,btohqsg
There is no competitors for SIA,btohqsg
cus we taking Analytics Mechanics tgt with the yr 3 mods,btohqsg
Ye but aren't those people from sia foundation years ,btohqsg
general industries.Or even job hopping  something that gets less possible as one ages,btohqsg
Got lmao just depends on which side,btohqsg
she's going for their executive training program  not air stewardess,btohqsg
think I had a friend who went before,btohqsg
But sth is that i think need to apply job specific,btohqsg
Yea i think the downside of sq is their air tixs is damn ex,btohqsg
True. U gotta plan for the long term indeed but I think Musician got trouble in the first stage. She cannot even sell herself as an attractive asset for now,btohqsg
Huh  no but aren't there other airlines as competitors to sia,btohqsg
Yea but it is still one of the top airlines in the world,btohqsg
hmm didn't get earlier part of story,btohqsg
Basically i somehow grew interest in the aviation industry after flying post-covid lol,btohqsg
Their air tixs are expensive because they have demand justifying the high prices,btohqsg
Qatar without any fatal or serious airline incidents be like ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Ya idk how SQ got 1st last yr,btohqsg
Just kidding but yea sia is a dominant market,btohqsg
It was apparently first in 2023,btohqsg
2023 was1) SQ2) Qatar3) ANA4) Emirates5) JAL,btohqsg
Oh I thought you meant incidents,btohqsg
But Singapore airlines have 2 total hull losses and 3 major accidents since it's formation years,btohqsg
I actually like to seat on the planeðŸ¤£,btohqsg
just get a job that gives you opportunities to fly,btohqsg
If I move my arms fast enough can I fly?,btohqsg
probably can in your dream (job),btohqsg
The sky is the limit (literally),btohqsg
and the world is your oyster,btohqsg
But u gotta shuck the oyster to get to the pearl,btohqsg
That's a pretty good record compared to Korean Air/China Airlines,btohqsg
Lets not talk about malaysiaOmo that is a pretty gd record compared to most airlines,btohqsg
Tofu dreg buildings to tofu dreg planes,btohqsg
nah  china airlines is from taiwan. which tbf  also has tofu dreg buildings,btohqsg
gg im actually tempted to apply SIA against my parentâ€™s wishes,btohqsg
just go  you miss 100% of the shots you don't take,btohqsg
Just tell them you become manager at sia,btohqsg
I think a managerial position would sit more better with them than a customer service oriented position,btohqsg
I need to find one first,btohqsg
precisely  musician's parents will flip if she goes to a customer service oriented position,btohqsg
Actually i alr found some i interested in,btohqsg
Who knows maybe flip her into another country,btohqsg
I previously didnt know SIA has many roles apart from cabin crews and pilots,btohqsg
There is like 145 mostly entry level jobs,btohqsg
it's inevitable  you need lots of people to support the operations of a global airline,btohqsg
just go for those that require a bachelor's degree  ignore the diploma positions,btohqsg
that filters out a lot of the 145 already,btohqsg
I will take some time tonight to filter things out,btohqsg
But omo yes i know it is hard to get into SIA,btohqsg
But if i dun try  it is a definite no,btohqsg
youâ€™re getting all 4 big areas in one sem. QM  classical mechanics  EM  stat mechanics (a bit in the tech applications mod),btohqsg
imagine what it was prior to the tuition,btohqsg
Herro ma nÃ¦ iÅŸ E rong ma,btohqsg
Damn i hv a friend who is in korea for 1m and fr her ig stories  it seems like she is â€˜staying and chillingâ€™ there,btohqsg
Ngl I miss the convenience stores there,btohqsg
I would hv spent way more if i did not control myself,btohqsg
How many famichikies did u consume?,btohqsg
My main concern abt applying to SIA now is ltr dk if it will be difficult to go elsewhere unless im prepared to stay in SIA till retirement (which i may be would considering how much i hate interviews),btohqsg
?? U don't have to stay in SIA for your entire career,btohqsg
We as young ppl can and should job hop.,btohqsg
You pay a loyalty tax if you stay in the same company for too long  job hopping keeps you moving up the ladder,btohqsg
One of my relatives did that,btohqsg
1 month trip to Korea with her bestie,btohqsg
Wah how come so many leaves,btohqsg
hi  does anyone have any recommendations for jc tutors teaching alvls syllabus?,btohqsg
Eh isn't self promotion or ad against the rules? BAN JUN WEI,btohqsg
ok la  it was an honest question by YS,btohqsg
Was gonna say jk given the enormous contribution that u have as an old timer,btohqsg
come to think of it  really here for some time liao,btohqsg
until the next kid coming out soon,btohqsg
Damn u have been busy ma dude,btohqsg
the govt never survey me on TFR issues,btohqsg
step 1  a one-time guaranteed Cat A/B COE for families with 3 kids and above below a certain age for a low price.Help families with young children able to travel around.Public transport not friendly enough for families with more young children,btohqsg
They just gonna give you a decommissioned taxi,btohqsg
U do that I guarantee u the birth rates magically skyrocket,btohqsg
step 2  bring back executive flats  6 rm flats. Only families with 3 kids and above can apply.,btohqsg
That one is like CDC vouchers give is just so they can say they doing something,btohqsg
How many family nucleus are there in sg ah,btohqsg
If every taxi that was nearing decommissioning was given or sold cheaply to households  that would increase tfr?,btohqsg
every taxi that is nearing decommissioning will have so much mileage on it that it wouldn't be worth much at all.,btohqsg
I mean they can sell it at a subsidized price compared to scrap metal value the govt gets+ for the govt  it brings in more eventually money when maintenance etc is added by owners of said decommissioned vehicles in the long run but should not exceed for car owners the 10-15k price range of a 1 yr old car with coe,btohqsg
just just to double cfm eae closing date for O lvl is from 20th-26th june right,btohqsg
I am bored. I wasting company time but got nothing to do,btohqsg
I'm unemployed  nothing to do  so go gym,btohqsg
I given a stipend of 1k a month to look busy,btohqsg
Im unemployed but lazy to apply for job,btohqsg
I mean for u. U actually doing extracurriculars what.,btohqsg
Student with an expensive concert hobby ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Damn why are there a lot of bad tourists in japan,btohqsg
Are they gonna remove more and more things because of the few bad tourists,btohqsg
Yes why don't u give me your hobby along with the tickets,btohqsg
How about i give you my gpa,btohqsg
Does it come with the tickets?,btohqsg
U gotta sweeten the deal Lestin,btohqsg
employ guards to barricade. and pay to take photo,btohqsg
+ France during Euro2016 and UK during Euro2021 very messy,btohqsg
Why is my aunt being a busy body and ss all my ig stories to my parents who are inactive on instagram,btohqsg
I hv been blocking her on and off a few times,btohqsg
Omo my dad opened the chat when i was behind him,btohqsg
Omo it is my acct so i can post whatever i want,btohqsg
My parents inactive so be it,btohqsg
I mean i just posted a general statement so idk what is their issue,btohqsg
Is this a singles aunt trait,btohqsg
Coz omo heard of other stories also,btohqsg
Meaning she still follow you but she cant see your shit (?),btohqsg
I did so but idk why i keep undoing it then regret afterwards,btohqsg
But i think it only works for stories but not posts,btohqsg
Meanwhile the next move japan is doing is to remove this statueðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Stop posting here about wanting to get a job and actually go and get one lol ðŸ™ƒ,btohqsg
I will permanently remove her fr close friends and also i kinda reposted the story on close friends,btohqsg
i blocked her on whatsapp before but she complained to my mum and my mum scolded me,btohqsg
Next time just tell your mom you dont use WhatsApp anymore,btohqsg
She was like â€˜she joined telegram just for us (referring to me n my cousin)â€™,btohqsg
Like basically saying she joined telegram aft learning youngsters nowadays use telegram instead,btohqsg
Tbh it is a siblings trait it seems but my uncle is ok thoðŸ’€ðŸ’€,btohqsg
Your dp reminded me i havent read the latest few chapters,btohqsg
My mum scolded me for posting about my bad experience w scoot,btohqsg
She needs to go find some mahjong kakis,btohqsg
Make me sound like i am v entitled,btohqsg
Scoot alr has a v bad reputation,btohqsg
And my acct is not even public,btohqsg
I wonder if BCMe can do any engineering courseðŸ¥²,btohqsg
Ik bioengineering but like I hate anything bio related,btohqsg
Is it possible for uni to give bridging lessons,btohqsg
Like to people with barely any physics background,btohqsg
Then they will accept bio students?,btohqsg
Cuz Iâ€™m thinking of courses likes civil/mechanical engineering etc,btohqsg
Might require a lot of physics knowledge,btohqsg
Any science will do. It's just physics would be advantageous,btohqsg
I want to go there man,btohqsg
Wait I see if I can find,btohqsg
But then entrance criteria is tougher right,btohqsg
I just checked NTU need physics,btohqsg
anyone in ang mo kio rn,btohqsg
I want to know if the fire rabak,btohqsg
ðŸš¨ For those going JC -Here's some help on choosing your subject combination!When choosing between H1 and H2 JC subjects  one of your considerations will be:If I take H1 for a certain subject  will it restrict my options? ðŸ¤¯The answer is YES for certain uni courses. In the above  I've compiled the popular courses from NUS and NTU  so check the courses you might be interested in before choosing subject combi :),btohqsg
But may not be accurate ah,btohqsg
Since I don't even have that,btohqsg
That means in order for me to go I must take physics as private candidate ah,btohqsg
but if U triple sci or smth,btohqsg
Then take combined science as private candidate lor,btohqsg
Yes  thousands of people have done so,btohqsg
Specifically civil/mechanical engineering in NTU tho,btohqsg
Yes  my jc friend was bcme and did civil eng,btohqsg
No o level  she was IP  RJ,btohqsg
For now I just grind bio first ah,btohqsg
Since thereâ€™s nothing much I can do,btohqsg
It's been almost 10 years. But I think they will give chance. Don't quote me though ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
Eh NF when did fire trucks have spoilers ah,btohqsg
I just saw a civil defence engine pass by with a roof spoiler,btohqsg
U can combine Science (Chem  Physics),btohqsg
Idk which one he score better at so just take combine if u fuck up the physics your other one can pull u up,btohqsg
Oh man combined science give me nightmares especially chem/physics,btohqsg
The formulars in itself alr kills memory,btohqsg
Ya I also took combined sci,btohqsg
I literally went all the way to mid way through sec 4 to realise what 1/2mgh means,btohqsg
isn't combined science already technically watered down?,btohqsg
It is but I had no gauge of what real science is mah,btohqsg
Combined physics is literally just vomiting formulas without understanding it,btohqsg
For physics it was the whole energy lifecycle pretty much,btohqsg
For chemistry  bulk of my year was actually common last topic,btohqsg
So the whole year  my chem teacher was the chillest teacher in the whole school,btohqsg
I mean if he wants he can take H1 Physics too lmao,btohqsg
Fyi common last topic taken out of o levels was organic chem,btohqsg
I took pure bio and chem in Os,btohqsg
Chem paper want from 80+ to 60+,btohqsg
This meant physics had a higher weightage  topic for physics taken out was magnets,btohqsg
If he plans on moving on to actual ntu engineering,btohqsg
Might as whack h2 phy alr,btohqsg
Get him ready for the pain,btohqsg
Because if you do h1 and you move onto engineering physics,btohqsg
He's guaranteed tears either ways cuz he has no foundation in Physics but suddenly wake up and want physics,btohqsg
Doesnâ€™t matter what you do  itâ€™s always guaranteed tears,btohqsg
I woke up and realised I love maths and hate Biology,btohqsg
Ok ya h2 phy is really much more desirable,btohqsg
You get practical expt practice and more content,btohqsg
Youre a male right i assume?,btohqsg
But idrk whatâ€™s the career prospects if I do maths in uni,btohqsg
Need to do something thatâ€™s practical and maths related,btohqsg
Just do well for your As first then study for physics in NS,btohqsg
Math has so much more career prospects...,btohqsg
Like that I do maths lmao,btohqsg
But then again I no FM,btohqsg
Anything that is math related can be done as a job,btohqsg
And more that i cant think about now,btohqsg
I thought those have their specific course,btohqsg
A math degree is diverse enough that it can be picked up,btohqsg
People think about math and physics degree and immediately jump into teaching,btohqsg
I mean teaching is the easiest assumption but like math and physics could pivot into different sectors,btohqsg
The purpose of an education is to stretch your mind and train you to think in different scenarios anyway  not memorise f=ma or the quadratic formula,btohqsg
One of the pretty cool job is at casinos  who look for people with Masters in Statistics,btohqsg
As long as I not playing,btohqsg
Youre so opposite from my jc friend lmao,btohqsg
He realised after A levels that physics is dogshit and wanted to pivot into biological science,btohqsg
Unfortunately the closest he could do is bioengineering lmao,btohqsg
i thought you go chs can take wtv as long as you do bridging mod,btohqsg
except like pharm or the restricted ones,btohqsg
I did physics instead of bio is coz i believe i can score btr in physicsðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Can go any course in uni,btohqsg
I got into ntu biomedical sci w phy bg lol,btohqsg
The whole course maj is bioðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
ngl i feel like imo the easiest humans is h1 geog/hist,btohqsg
cause h1 hist is just ip hist with extra stuff,btohqsg
Ive never heard anyone said h1 geog was easy,btohqsg
and it's quite close to o level pure hist also,btohqsg
yt said h1 geog he dont study can get D so he thought it was easy,btohqsg
My friend studied for her life,btohqsg
Also got D for h1 geog,btohqsg
"for me i think h1 hist is the ""easiest"" for me out of all the humans",btohqsg
ya that one legit diff breed,btohqsg
maybe this is a sign to drop,btohqsg
me but never study for my life,btohqsg
biomedical uses physics math and chem all of them so,btohqsg
h1 geog is a woman idk her name,btohqsg
ya and tbh h2 bio not that related to medicine anyway. i think math and chem more impt,btohqsg
Ryan ur from yi jc ?,btohqsg
I think you said before but cant remember,btohqsg
I keep hearing people around me saying that H1 Econs is the easiest,btohqsg
my tablemate regret taking h1 econ and want to change to hist cause she got U for wa1,btohqsg
Now I want do geog also,btohqsg
Maybe I dodged a bullet maybe I didnâ€™t,btohqsg
im glad i never even considered taking econs,btohqsg
Some people say the content heavier than Econs,btohqsg
idk why idl econs so much,btohqsg
Funny enough my initial choice was h1 lit,btohqsg
But then I took comb geog so got some foundation,btohqsg
But my seniors was like nobody passed h1 lit during their 1st year,btohqsg
I also donâ€™t know if the jump is big,btohqsg
And back then my promo criteria was either 2h2 1h1 contrast or 3h2,btohqsg
So i got scared af and changed to econs lol,btohqsg
I hate it also cuz my teacher give alot of work,btohqsg
"no idk why but like when ppl say ""if uw med go jc and take bcme"" i be like why must take econs... ik it's like the ""default"" but still",btohqsg
O level geog content fucking useless,btohqsg
Other class I heard their cher donâ€™t care,btohqsg
then got multiple ppl ask me why i dont take  econs also,btohqsg
like when i tell them my subj combi their first qn is why not bcme,btohqsg
Idk about yall but h1 econs content is not even that hard,btohqsg
my sch is BCME most common alot of ppl take 4h2,btohqsg
Ok but the skills r prolly Sama Sama tho,btohqsg
I can say this cuz I literally take H1 geog,btohqsg
ah the shit current version of A level geog,btohqsg
I mean if there was h1 lit i would take,btohqsg
but my sch doesnt offer h1 e lit,btohqsg
but legit la ppl sound very surprised when they hear my combi,btohqsg
i wonder if you guys know any hybrid computing/fmath students,btohqsg
ik one person took math computing lit and h1  geog,btohqsg
ik someone taking stuff more niche than that,btohqsg
"my classmate said her mom was like 'why you dont take 4h2""",btohqsg
1 person in entire batch take kind,btohqsg
These R the legit weird fuck combis ik,btohqsg
Lol my school got a lot weird combi,btohqsg
Or maybe cuz I too basic,btohqsg
My classmate who went to Ur sch,btohqsg
I thought she trolling at first sia,btohqsg
Iâ€™m like why u take H1 art,btohqsg
Meanwhile my batch in my JC: t w o,btohqsg
^what they offered for this year,btohqsg
U literally must take chem n bio tgt as h2,btohqsg
Like if uw bio H2 ah,btohqsg
I feel like H2 maths and chem legit open a lot of doors for u in uni,btohqsg
Other than yi I nvr hear of,btohqsg
Let U take H2 bio without H2 chem,btohqsg
That's y I chose my combi,btohqsg
If yi allows it  so will ny,btohqsg
Nyjc has the most flexible subject combis among all jcs  followed by Acjc,btohqsg
I thought even tm offered that  I guess I recalled wrongly,btohqsg
I heard even hybrid combos R banned,btohqsg
If U take only 1h2 sci,btohqsg
Maybe it's a demand thing also,btohqsg
