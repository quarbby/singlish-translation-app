Hello good morning gurus. If I have been using citi premier miles card to clock local spend  it would be better if I switch over to UOB priv miles card to clock local spend right?Because after I clock my citi rewards 10x and cashback I was wondering is there a better option than using my Premier miles card.I am also planning to sign up for SC journey card if the merchant code I am going to spend a big purchase fulfills their requirement for the miles since I am new user.So for daily use  what do yall recommend?Ever since learning and reading from here  I start to review my daily spending. Really appreciate the advice here üôè,btohqsg
Depends on what u are spending on.. usually will avoid 1.2 mpd or 1.5% cashback type. Better if u could share the type of spent.,btohqsg
Should start looking at 4mpd cards for ur day to day spend,btohqsg
Isn't local spend like in general cover everything? Because I think I am clocking all my dining be it cafe  restaurant  coffee chains on uob evo but probably switch to hsbc live plus soon.Then my citibank reward is used for like my online purchases and app store spending.I was thinking for spending not covered under any umbrella  let's say personal training  membership fees  b2b expenses(like media company for creative jobs) etc,btohqsg
Basically I trying to find a card to capture the those that don't fall under the most mcc code  and just clock miles based on amount spent.,btohqsg
I already have citirewards but my monthly gaming spent can be 500 to 1k so I max out the 10x points cap quite fast.,btohqsg
for offline spend using mobile contactless and some online MCCs can use uob ppv  4mpd cap for $1110 spend,btohqsg
Wow this seems good! Why does it seem like it's even better than UOB supposedly miles card like their krisflyer or priv card? I mean using Google or apply pay is like accessible everywhere now,btohqsg
The general spend also can be covered by uob vs  ppv crmc  or other cashback cards with higher % like divert spent into hsbc live+ then use your crmc for other spending,btohqsg
Crmc is a wild card for my use so I dun use it up directly,btohqsg
yea that's why we recommend using 4mpd cards instead  there is cap to the 4mpd though,btohqsg
Hi is the hsbc sg mobile app down?,btohqsg
how does uob ppv compare to citirewards for day to day spend i.e hawker? from the outside looks like their biggest difference is the spend cap,btohqsg
Hi does anyone have any way to convert credit card balances to cash?,btohqsg
Yeah I agree. My crmc is meant for my online game spending and like physiotherapist visits or shopee.Dining wise I trying to get the hsbc live plus since the rebate till end of 2024 seems good.,btohqsg

Btw I was wondering  do some ppl strategise ahead by cancelling an acc with a bank  wait out 1 year then reapply for sign up bonuses? In the event whereby the current bonuses doesn't appeal to them anymore.,btohqsg
uob ppv award for $5 block. Amaze+citi rewards mastercard $1 block,btohqsg
For e.g now hsbc live is giving this really good rebate but expire end 2024. Maybe using this enticing offer to keep ppl on hsbc before they release a better version of revo card. And maybe even give a good sign up bonus ?,btohqsg
Yes it's called cash advance. But not advisable to do since you'll rack up way more interest than a personal loan,btohqsg
From the looks of it  it seems that HSBC is planning to segregate cashback cards from miles cards rather than points. There might be a new miles card in the future since they implemented miles pooling which doesn‚Äôt make sense if they see people are cancelling revoPeople do cancel card to anticipate for ntb offer depending on how badly you need the card in your current spending habits,btohqsg
"there won't be a new ""miles card"" other than TOne and Revo in my opinion. It's kinda like SCB  where they are just happy to maintain Journey and Smart and put a full-stop to their lineup",btohqsg
Well  depends on which angle you‚Äôre looking at. If you see it from the bank‚Äôs perspective and seeing people cancelling revo  will you not launch a miles card to keep up with the competition?,btohqsg
which is why they are launching Live+. Juice it up with big cashback to draw customers in early  then hope that they stick to the card for convenience's sake come 2025. Majority of bank customers are not min-maxers. They will stick to a particular card once it fits their spending patterns regardless of nerds  I mean nerfs üòÅ,btohqsg
Miles pooling with only one effective miles card simply doesn‚Äôt work,btohqsg
for you  not for the bank's bottom line,btohqsg
Then again  depends on how you look at things in a bigger picture and foresight,btohqsg
Hi  generally what‚Äôs the interest rate for quick cash loan attached to your credit card?,btohqsg
Oh not cash advance. Cause I paid some charges to the credit card. Then called up to cancel the card. Now they say can waive the fees  they credited the charges back to my credit card but unable to convert to cash. So I was wondering if there are any ways to convert. Cause my intention is to cancel the credit card after I utilised the credit amount.,btohqsg
"Perhaps you can try letting them know of your intention to cancel the credit card  then check with them whether the credited amount can be returned to you in the form of cheque or bank transfer? As far as I'm aware banks cannot ""owe"" even a cent to you when you close an account",btohqsg
Any pro tips to anticipate? Like experienced ppl who have done it,btohqsg
Yea  called the bank.Was told it was overdue payments.,btohqsg
Hmm I see  okay I‚Äôll try talking to them about it. Thanks a lot for the tip!,btohqsg

Hello  anyone having issues adding Citi rewards Mastercard in amaze? I cannot seem to add it in/ see it reflected in amaze even though my Citibank app tells me it has been added.,btohqsg
total and perfectly normal to get this..Because SCB is being an S by being very stingy with annual fee waivers.. even the $196.20 annual fee cards.,btohqsg
Very likely they will return through cheque. But if you call them you might get back through bank transfer instead.,btohqsg
just curious  how does Citibank app tell u it has been added?,btohqsg
You can find out from the bank's website. But it's 100% bad financial decision to do so.,btohqsg
The reason I asked is I got a call from citi saying it‚Äôs 2.9%. Am I assuming it‚Äôs p.a?,btohqsg
Sounds more realistic if it's 2.9% fee.,btohqsg
Hmmmm. Thanks. Let me read the details that they will send,btohqsg
why is it a 100% bad financial decision? It is good if it is lower interest than other loan options or can yield more earning than the interest charge.,btohqsg
