Then yes. I will suggest make an offer of$XXXamount  including the legal fees in it.Come up with a reason that you are tight with cash and hope for their understanding.,btohqsg
Yah  Maybank told me to go fly kite,btohqsg

She says she will try 50%. So frm 0.75 to 0.375 ü§û,btohqsg
I suggest next time use a mortgage broker. U get better rates than dealing with it urself and it doesn‚Äôt cost u anythjng,btohqsg
I used a broker  but issue is that i did it way too early in Mar this year,btohqsg
When my lock-in expires only in mid Nov 21,btohqsg
And i completely forgot i actually did sign something (cos no documentation frm bank yet),btohqsg
And happily repriced w maybank when they offered,btohqsg
Hope at least ur Maybank reprice is cheaper than the new Dbs deal,btohqsg
If u need business loan advice  company insurance quotation  working capital management or sourcing  I‚Äôm your guy.,btohqsg
Yes it isDBS charges 1.28% for 3-yr FRMaybank charges 1.12% for 3-yr FR,btohqsg
Dbs lawyer wrote in to maybank on the redemption amount in mar 2021 right? And maybank should know that u are doing full redemption/ refinancing to another bank. Why maybank still allow u to do repricing ?,btohqsg
I checked with Maybank myself and relayed the info to DBS.Hence they out the transaction on hold till now,btohqsg
I think the it was flagged for completion mid Nov 21 and law firm only restart the process abt 2 wks back.But i have already applied to reprice with Maybank,btohqsg
Ur repricing reset to the new rate already?,btohqsg
Honestly IMO  i think the Maybank dun give a damm,btohqsg
Cos even if the law firm asked about the outstanding loan  the dept that handles it prob will not relay the info to the dept who does reprice,btohqsg
To be honest  doubt dbs will waive off the charges. Somemore lawyer is engaged.Higher chance is to cancel the repricing the other side if repricing haven commence,btohqsg
No. Not started yet.To cancel reprice  is 1.5% of 590k üò¢,btohqsg
This one is easier to waive.,btohqsg
I called in to ask.The lady who handled my reprice ask me go fly kite,btohqsg
Not in the literal sense. But basically cannot. Moreover my current loan is w MB,btohqsg
Actually I am not asking DBS to waive but to reduce the penalty,btohqsg
By right the law firm send in to Maybank to serve notice for redeem of loan they shld not ask u to reprice. It‚Äôs their fault,btohqsg
Ask law firm for black n white they did notify them,btohqsg
Unless u contact Maybank to ask for reprice?,btohqsg
No  Maybank contacted me via email,btohqsg
I asking the law firm if they ever serve notice to Maybank,btohqsg
We are dazzled by various cryptocurrencies. Can someone recommend some better ones?,btohqsg
Sol  FTT  srm  all under SBF. Cannot underestimate this fellow,btohqsg
U do with sme business loan too?,btohqsg
@evilkulaI clarified with the law firm acting for DBS.Apparently the law firmed served a notice of redemption to Maybank on 15 Sep  yet MayBank proceed to approve my reprice on 15 Oct.I will b writing to the Maybank consultant that I will b making a complain to MAS on unethical practice shld Maybank not cancel the reprice and allow DBS to redeem the loan,btohqsg
Hope everything work out fine for youüòä,btohqsg
