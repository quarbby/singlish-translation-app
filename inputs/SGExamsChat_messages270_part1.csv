I always use their black pen,btohqsg
I got a phobia of blue,btohqsg
Like i keep thinking unlucky colour,btohqsg
Like all my pens are black,btohqsg
I from acroball 1.0 then I change to pilot g2 0.7 blue pen,btohqsg
This is way more better than the pilot g2,btohqsg
@its_shxnu 1.0 all the way ah,btohqsg
During my O level time  I loved to use that pen to write on the legend paper (for POA) as it made me feel like I wrote nicerðŸ˜…But now I rarely use pen because of HBL and usually my exams were done by using laptop,btohqsg
I cant find this in popular.-.,btohqsg
I only know that correction tape and ink pen are strongly not recommended to be used,btohqsg
any1 can tell mi where to get tis other than shamelessly taking from dsta,btohqsg
omg my pharmacist nvr scold me@its_shxn,btohqsg
Just be careful not to throw away wrong medication again,btohqsg
They say rp easy  grad all the same cert as the other polys,btohqsg
rp is not easier than any other poly,btohqsg
This one depends on the course,btohqsg
NoI didn't have to write report everyday,btohqsg
But I see from like an online forum like uni or if u go work they will rather take in ppl from like example ngeean or sp,btohqsg
lemme ask u this qns I asked myself back when I was a Os student,btohqsg
np/sp 3.73 gpa rp 4.0 gpa,btohqsg
This one is falseOkayInitially it was true because RP used to be a dumping groundBut now the time has changedThey start accepting the ppl from RP,btohqsg
cuz  I will say 1 thign,btohqsg
Start accepting le?? But not widely as the other polys ?,btohqsg
its like how ppl looked down on ite,btohqsg
ite ppl got 4.0 gpa and poly ppl got 1.8 gpa,btohqsg
they will keep ite student then to poly,btohqsg
not everyone starts on the same ground,btohqsg
u dont have to start off in the same poly,btohqsg
its the amount of hardwork u put in,btohqsg
But studying in RP has one more benefit than other polysRP has problem-based learning. Almost everyday the students have to do the presentation and solve the real-life problems. Keep on training to do the presentation and real-life problems  then won't be struggling when you're in university or in the workplace,btohqsg
to show how worthy u r,btohqsg
and one more benefit is u only got 1 mod per day,btohqsg
source the eae webinar from XX years ago,btohqsg
unlike other poly more than 1,btohqsg
So like initially I did some research la they said ngeean was the best at business so that's why I wanted to go there go pfp and take common business programme,btohqsg
Right that's what my brother said too,btohqsg
totally not once a sec 4na,btohqsg
My brother just told me he had a like 30min lecture then the lecturer dismiss them,btohqsg
now lecture all online and prerecorded haaahha,btohqsg
All ppl around me said pfp is good etc,btohqsg
"technically u dont even have to ""attend"" them ðŸ˜‚",btohqsg
So naturally all students try to aim pfp lah,btohqsg
now u hear 4 4na kiddos saying its a skem ah,btohqsg
So I also wanted aim for pfp not cuz bandwagon la,btohqsg
if I can find my pfp shit notes,btohqsg
But my goal before my brother told me was to go ngeean take common business programe,btohqsg
My cousin said he learnt basic sec 3 math,btohqsg
But now he say ngeean is shit,btohqsg
And tells me not to go therr,btohqsg
Then he also told me if he can rewind back he rather go rp,btohqsg
