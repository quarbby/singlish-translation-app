100 extra is not very worth imo. One year is extra 1200 to earn interest elsewhere. My habit is to calculate the MAB myself to get to the exact cents. So I can just ensure current month MAB is exactly 500 or 500.01 (to cater for rounding) more than previous month.Although in realality I usually make sure new MAB is 500.1 more than the last month.,btohqsg
There are two ways:1). Start with $100k n increase $520 every month. Need to find a reset month.2). Start with $97600 + $600 x 4 months and reset the account by moving the fund to somewhere on 5th month.,btohqsg
Reset every 5 months means still lose 2.4 months (on average) of interest per year  that is a lot.I usually do option 1 but just increase 500.1 per month.,btohqsg

Cheapest brokerage commission (CDP-linked): For SGX stocks  buy trades with DBS Vickers 0.12% with minimum comm $10.80; sell trades with FSMONE flat rate $8.80. For SGX ETFs  Poems Cash Management account buy/sell 0.28% no minimum commission.Dividends will be directly credited into your bank account registered with CDP  totally unaffected by the choice of brokers for your buy/sell trades.,btohqsg
Good morning!! Paragon medical centre - which credit card to use? Amex?,btohqsg
can always find another bank account with high interest for the reset month,btohqsg
Can park fund in other banks such as HSBC4.6% or Moomoo 5.8% during reset month.Option 1 is suitable for those who know how to manage n control the fund in n out of account n adjust MAB back to $500.1 if drifting out of range.Option 2 is for those who still not good in MAB adjustment or no time to monitor.Of course option 1 will give a better return.,btohqsg
Thanks  I already have a Poems under Cash Management Account but initially used it to buy stocks. Then after I have been using moomooo to buy REITs.. just wondering if I have about $1-2k per month that I want to invest in stocks or ETF and collect dividends   whether I should use Poems which dividends is deposit into my bank account (safer) or like moomoo which has lower comm fee but dividends is deposit to moomoo,btohqsg
For me  I prefer CDP  stocks are in my name and dividends are credited to my bank account. You should consider using DBS Vickers Cash upfront trading to buy SGX stocks 0.12% with $10.80 minimum commission. However Poems Cash management account is cheapest for buying and selling SGX ETF,btohqsg
I referred my friend to join under me  successfully tracked  she started spending more than $10 on 4 Dec  until now both of us never get the $5 referral bonus too.,btohqsg
Hi  where is the best place (and ways) to invest my toddler‚Äôs money regularly? Im thinking of accumulating s&p 500 etf (but open to ideas too) for him in an account where all the funds are clearly his (as opposed to mixing his funds with mine and using excel to track his funds). But toddlers are not able to open account in their names.,btohqsg
Thanks  sorry for a silly question.. SGX ETF is it like SPDR STI ETF and Nikko AM STI ETF?,btohqsg
Do voluntary topping up cpf medisave to bhs with 3000 sgd affect the annual limit of total cpf contribution 37740. I am asking this because If I do topup I may loose some employer contribution if it reach the max contribution in next december/november.,btohqsg
Thanks apparently its only since 2022. Vcma is not part of the annual limit of 37500 max contribution. So it effectively acts as additional tax relief and additional contribution possibility.,btohqsg
In this case  is it reliable to use iChange virtual card when travelling overseas? ü§î,btohqsg
Have issue at times. Can create another virtual card and use then problem solve.,btohqsg
Do you mean by another virtual card such as youTrip during travelling?,btohqsg
No. You can create many virtual cards freely on ichange app.Just the referral rewards is no longer automatic.,btohqsg
oh ok . Thanks for the info üôè,btohqsg

How to make voluntary contributions to CPF  I am self employed since March this year but it‚Äôs not there in the records of IRAS and cpf yet,btohqsg
The mystery continues. I transferred in $791.50 yesterday . My average daily balance increase from -$30 yesterday is now $58.01,btohqsg
Is there a way to find out the mab for uob one acc?,btohqsg
Why you want to find out MAB?You are not supposed to use the account for non necessary transactions. So your daily account balance shall remain constant throughout the month.,btohqsg
There is no mystery. It is either you don‚Äôt understand the math or you captured wrong data.,btohqsg
So I know if I don't have or have too much inside. And if too much I can shift some out.,btohqsg
Certain periods of the month I may need to shift amts out  but they will be deposited back a week or so later. So to make up for the absence I tend to keep a little more inside just to have an average. I noticed that every month during interest credit they will tell you what's your mab for previous month  but just wondering if there is a 'live' feature,btohqsg
From past messages that I see is that creating your own excel tracker will be the best gauge.,btohqsg
If you want to know previous month MAB  login using Web portal. The previous month MAB info is there.,btohqsg
Then you make your life difficult. üòÖ.I prefer keep the amount constant throughout the month. Every day has same end day balance.,btohqsg
Hi gurus  how much should I OA-SA transfer at the age of 30?,btohqsg
Yah I‚Äôm terrible at this üòî.There is no lag right? What I transferred in yesterday before 6pm will be reflected fully today,btohqsg
u got see the as of date?,btohqsg
The mystery likely is there is other transactions that has total amount $204.62 n it affects your MAB ?,btohqsg
Hopefully ichange can stabilise their operations‚Ä¶ been hearing alot of delays about physical card deliveries.But their exchange rate is damn good so lan lan suck thumb‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Hi gurus  ocbc titanium pair with amaze card still entitled to get bonus point from purchase lazada online?,btohqsg
Depends on how much you need to stay in OA. The biggest usage of OA is usually mortgage,btohqsg
should use ocbc titanium directly for Lazada  which is whitelisted merchant for 10x points. Using Amaze will change merchant to Amaze  may not get 10x points if MCC dun fall under the whitelisted MCC list. No reason to use Amaze anyway.,btohqsg
Already charged to the amaze cardüòÖ,btohqsg
Actually if you want CDP linkage which I personally prefer for SGX stocks  using Poems Cash management or DBS Vickers Cash upfront to buy DBS shares will require about $3200 for minimum order of 100units per trade. Good thing about Poems is it has unit share trading (no need to buy minimum 100units per trade) but the unit share price is priced higher than the normal listing price.,btohqsg
Where can I understand when to transfer cpf oa to sa. and when to topup cpf ma or sa account. to maximize return and tax relief.,btohqsg
My calculation shows he has another 264.62 deposit into the account  in addition to the 791.5. Exactly $60 more than your number.. Not sure why..Oh well  not very important.. LOL..,btohqsg
Hi  Whats best way to combine UOB ONE Visa with Krisflyer UOB Credit Card?,btohqsg
wow very sharp  usually I put $501.x,btohqsg
I think FSMONE flat rate $8.80 has not include other fee  usually I pay around 1x.xx depends on the total purchased,btohqsg
He already missed out last few months of OCBC save bonus interest due to either wrong calculation or not understand the game rules. I won‚Äôt recommend him to try $500.1 until he fully understands the formula n game rules. I suggest to use $600 to let him collect this month 365 save bonus interest first so that he can have extra $$ for Chinese new year expenses.,btohqsg
After the base interest comes in  it will increase my MAB with another ~14 cents.. So the MAB for this month in realty will be ~500.24 more than last month's MAB. I feel that it is enough buffer for me. üòÑ It is not my main account anyway  not many in/out transactions  no chance to miss. lol,btohqsg
So if transfer to ownself. It will not be reserved for RA?,btohqsg
Yeah. Understand. I think he has additional in/out transactions in the account other than just interest and salary credit. So 600 may not be enough for him. I will suggest him to use excel to calculate last month's MAB and this month's current MAB first. As long as his own calculation matches the number on ibanking  he will naturally know how much to top up/withdraw on any of the day  in order to maintain the target amount.,btohqsg
