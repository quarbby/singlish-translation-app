ill recommend dining ü§£ went to a few bars/pubs thinking entertainment but all tagged as dining üò±,btohqsg
how do you check the MCC code in advance?i think its the other way too that quite alot of restaurants are actually coded as bars and pubs too right?>,btohqsg
for overseas spend  will it also be categorized by mcc?,btohqsg
i used heymax to check üòÖ eg. Club Rich was entertainment in heymax but when paid MCC was dining so only got 1%. Had a few encounters in JB eg Uncle don different outlets different MCC  austin was entertainment but pelangi branch was dining so a little confusing...,btohqsg
Heymax not accurate. Best to use Amaze empty wallet.,btohqsg
yep its categorised by MCC as well  based on experience a more well-rounded option is dining üôèüèª,btohqsg
does revolut work tht way too?,btohqsg
New to money smart  is applying for credit card the only way to get smart points without buying the smart points directly?,btohqsg
If I‚Äôm buying a MacBook‚Ä¶ would u recommend using citi rewards or UOB one üôÇ. Citi rewards right?,btohqsg
Citi rewards is capped at 1k spendWhile uob one is not suitable for big ticket item,btohqsg
Try to look up for Chris  big ticket item video about him talking about the best card to spend for big ticket item,btohqsg
Does it make a difference if I use UOB one card when I buy the Apple product on Shopee.. for that extra 5% cashback,btohqsg
Uob one gets 10% cashback at Shopee.,btohqsg
Do note of the tier cap for the additional cashback.,btohqsg
If you're pass month statement is over 2k  then it's worth using one card to pay since you're getting 6.67% Cashback. Which is quite high,btohqsg
If you're using uob one  you need to see your pass month statement. Since there a tier of either 500  1k or 2k,btohqsg
Ahhh got it! Many thanks all ‚ù§Ô∏è,btohqsg

Hi if u pair ur card with amaze n spend   do it counts as the ‚Äúminimum spend‚Äù requirement for the gift for new sign up??,btohqsg
If referring to CRMC paired with Amaze - Yes  on the basis that MCC not excluded,btohqsg
count as min spend provided mcc not excluded,btohqsg
Saw the TnC  should be ok  provided MCC not excluded,btohqsg
Ok thanks!! Quite new to this but if spend in jb also considered? If MCC included ones,btohqsg
think you should aim to get 8% rebate which require 800 min spend in a month1) if mcc falls under one of your selected categories and within S$312.50 spend for the category  use Amaze2) otherwise use the card direct at jb in myr,btohqsg
Ahh alright  im concerned about the 1.3k minimum spend now. If i spend in JB using myr will it be counted in 1.3??,btohqsg
Yes should be  counted in the equivalent S$ amt ofc,btohqsg
hi  does anyone know if its a qualifying transaction for citi smrt card if i made a payment at fairprice through apple pay?,btohqsg
Need to check tnc  but if thought fair price  should be qualified,btohqsg
Good morning everyone  (probably discussed before) just wanna get a feel of what everyone is doing and which platform are you using.I‚Äôm down to moomoo vs ibkr- like the ui of moomoo better- fx spread of ibkr better  moomoo fx spread is shit- on ibkr can set up recurring payment to negate the 2usd exchange fees but moomoo has no exchange fees- moomoo deposit and withdrawal almost instant  ibkr for reason takes a long time and ibkr only allow 1 free withdrawal per monthQuestions to everyone1. Which platform are you using moomoo or ibkr?2. Is it worth it to put up with ibkr just for its favourable fx spread and its ability to buy Ireland domicile ETFs?3. Are you guys buying Ireland domicile ETFs of just heck  buy US domicile ones (as moomoo only offers that. (Not the worse idea as us domicile etf has better volume bid ask though got 30% dwt!),btohqsg
Is there anyway to use all yuu points in one shot? Or what's the fastest way to clear all yuu points ?,btohqsg
How long it takes to convert to Kris flyer miles ?,btohqsg
Or can it convert to Kris pay miles ?,btohqsg
Convert KF miles first then convert KF miles to krispay miles. But value is bad imo.,btohqsg
Ok already done ! It's really instant ! Thanks guys üòÄYes and the value is super bad . About 70% lesser from yuu value to Kris pay miles value,btohqsg
I wanna cancel the Yuu card for personal reasons . So wanna quickly clear all the points,btohqsg
if canceling Citi credit card beside not to touch the annual fees given‚Äôs 10k miles  does anyone know is I should not touch the annual relationship bonus miles too?,btohqsg
What is touch annual fee? Cancel or not cancel that card?,btohqsg
Citi credit card gave 10k miles for renewal but also the annual relationship additional miles‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Any DBS treasures/ WMA users here can confirm if there is maximum limit on the number for SGD fixed deposits I can have in my account? I believe treasures allows multiple FDs of $19 999 (12 month tenure at 3.2%) wondering if there is a cap to it?,btohqsg
Hi  I just watched Chris's latest video on multi currency card. Trust  GXS have only 0.09% mark up fee on foreign exchange. But in reality the bank charges additional 3% fees for foreign transaction right?,btohqsg
Trust and GXS are already the banks. No additional fees,btohqsg
I see .. but the relationship years to me is not that important focusing on 4mpd is the key. As for 10k miles is your miles valuation more than 2cpm?,btohqsg
I've already got $19 999 x5 in my WMA   was thinking of adding more. the limit is def over 2 just not sure how much,btohqsg
the relationship years for Citi can be decent for Prestige Card if you whack Payall.I just whacked one cycle for Payall and I got over $100+ value of Relationship year bonus,btohqsg
27 062 points / 2.5 = 10825 miles x 1.5 cents = $162 value (goes towards offsetting the $545 annual fee).,btohqsg
Of course this is for LAST YEAR  since Citi Payall had decent promo pricing so it made sense to whack it.25 000 renewal miles10 825 relationship bonus milesTotal = 35 825 miles x 1.5 cents = $537 (already can cover the $545 annual fee). And we all know Prestige has other perks of good value like limo  unlimited priority pass  4NF.Must see Q4 2024 Citi Payall pricing  if it is lousy  then the allure of Citi Prestige will go down also.,btohqsg
chocolate finance reducing interest from 4.2 to 3.6 starting 1st nov,btohqsg
The $162 is amount spend ?,btohqsg
Personally I go for universal 2% cashback for category I cannot earn 4mpd.,btohqsg
u know i am talking about Citi Payall right? which you can use to pay things that usually earns no rewards.,btohqsg
