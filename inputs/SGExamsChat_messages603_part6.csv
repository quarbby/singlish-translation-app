i heard 1gb from my friends,btohqsg
Think another one got a secret stash on his tele,btohqsg
But he got a stash for sure,btohqsg
Is it like after the segment with parents,btohqsg
Or as soon as you step in,btohqsg
anyone here listen to lady gaga,btohqsg
Ppl still listen to lady gaga ü•∫ü•πü•π,btohqsg
Regardless whether saf spf and scdf,btohqsg
Ns u need black framed  plastic specs?,btohqsg
so long as dark coloured should be fine. I went in with dark green specs,btohqsg
can get these for SPORTS MODE ü§°,btohqsg
Must the receipt be date after enlistment then can claim,btohqsg
So must buy after 1st day?,btohqsg
Idek why it didn't blow up,btohqsg
Does it hurt the ear after wearing it for prolonged periods of time,btohqsg
I'm not a gd representative of the 04 LOL,btohqsg
"Like my 07 classmates jokingly taunted me like "" Ew u listen to lady gaga?"" ü§Æü§Æ",btohqsg
I rmb I was chronically offline/away from social media such that idk what were vines back then lol   it was only during P6 MYE I started to learn abit more,btohqsg

I gg sch in 2 days :(,btohqsg
I realized combined physics has more topics than bio,btohqsg
And I have to wear long pants,btohqsg
expect ur grades to drop when you go upper sec,btohqsg
same dude  except i have break every mon and wed,btohqsg
and my sch is ending in feb,btohqsg
i think the reason why it didnt blow up is because the song is a bit too nsfw,btohqsg
it's fine there's probably still less memory work,btohqsg
doesn't mean much. Topics can be divided into sub topics and so on.Even with sub topics there could be different question patterns and types.So topic numbers alone doesn't tell how much is really tested,btohqsg
i think you can just get by remembering definitions in physics,btohqsg
u know u fked when a tutor calls u out,btohqsg
thats kinda how i got by sec sch physics,btohqsg
but theres a reason i didnt take it in jc,btohqsg
if you're just aiming to pass it works,btohqsg
atarax was from the same sch?,btohqsg
that‚Äôs why matcha thought that atarax was me,btohqsg
remembering definitions can earn you like a lot of marks in examsusually some questions just ask for definitions  you just slot in and full marks alr,btohqsg
fair enough. Though getting by doesn't mean pass to me.Pass is C6 which is honestly a useless grade.,btohqsg
for the 2023 paper  only 5 marks were definitions.But previous years had more definitions. This is for O Levels.General trend is a reduction in the number of definitions,btohqsg
which sounds good enough to me,btohqsg
for A levels itself  for 2018 paper  1/4 of the paper was definitionsBut this year  also only few marks,btohqsg
for your year maybe. For students yet to take  it is poor advice,btohqsg
But  if you have a basic understanding already  definitions are important. Many formulas do come from it.So in a way  you aren't overly wrong also,btohqsg
you can derive stuff from the definition and make sense of it,btohqsg
"Ya  but this isn't ""just by remembering definitions""",btohqsg
i did just rmb the definitions because they tell you what the formula looks like,btohqsg
works for questions like resistance.Doesn't work for questions involving drawing free body diagrams.In the new syllabus  it's unsure yet whether it will work for nuclear physics,btohqsg
In other words  for you  you already had that basic understanding  and you were very able to analyse and turn it into an advantage  which is smart. üëçAlso  your mastery of practical is definitely there as well.,btohqsg
yea if you can score decently just from definitions  chances are you alr understood the definitions and concepts enough to translate it to the math. that understanding is the core skill  not just memory,btohqsg
if anything it's kind of the opposite,btohqsg
understanding well makes remembering any definition infinitely easier,btohqsg
