Hello guys  just a quick survey( 1 question). PythonIs anyone here keen to learn programming ? (Even if you are not in CS or smth),btohqsg
Just doing some survey to gauge  how many people want,btohqsg
im interested depending on whatever is taught ig,btohqsg
i learnt basic python programming but i wanna go through the pain again,btohqsg
What can repeat exact word for word wat u say,btohqsg
liver transplants are expensive but the government in singapore provides schemes and subsidies for those with financial difficulties,btohqsg
i wanna know what happened bef she said that,btohqsg
but what lead to her saying that,btohqsg
probably related to the questions of the course she's being interviewed for,btohqsg
I don't remember biomed sci needing to know that,btohqsg
i think she was referencing a scenario oni,btohqsg
But still tho if the interviewer cringe then like context matters so,btohqsg
maybe out of context or incorrect knowledge,btohqsg
I only know gov subsidise  50% of surgery so,btohqsg
some is the way the interviewer hears how the interviewee describes,btohqsg
then anymore is either medifund or social,btohqsg
Maybe she left it very vague,btohqsg
