Updates on Hyphens. Decent closing for today? Hope can close day high. This chart is nice because they have rest and consolidated for a long time. Also all the T volume spike are bigger. Believe someone has been accumulating slowly/ investing. Goldman inside as well. As they sold me 4 lots at $0.31 yesterday,btohqsg
Ok to enter at .325? 😅,btohqsg
Great Hyphens Pharma and Aim Apac Reits close day high. Aspen did well too.,btohqsg

Update on Hyphens Pharma. Closed day high at $0.33 which is above the 100MA. First time in a long time it closed past 100MA. The power should come soon.Also  all the earlier volume spikes  if you zoom in  they are strong green candles followed by little sell down. This suggest someone have been accumulating and consolidating it whilst it went to rest. Medicals looks like they are starting to be in play. Can expect more to come from this one. DYODD. This counter even if stuck  as long as can hold will be able to win from it. There is fundamentals and dividends supporting it. Good luck to holders. This is my ‘dark horse’ for 2021,btohqsg
Dont look like Uncle to me hahah. Hope we all huat together . Aspen and Hyphens for the taking. Then beer 🍻 celebrations!,btohqsg

🙏🏻 this one should be safe to ride along the medicals play  but need to watch overall medical sentiments.Also not too liquid now  but if the operators want to play it  they will have to bring it up higher where the earlier liquidity is.Anyways  market can change fast so need to prepare SL always if enter this or any trade.Opportunity costs out there,btohqsg
