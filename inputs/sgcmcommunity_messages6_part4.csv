Not exact the answer‚Ä¶ I want to say I have asked SGCarMart to sell a couple of times and the ‚Äú100s‚Äù of dealers always bid lower than my eventual seller to a random car dealer,btohqsg
Lemon law does not cover second hand car mkt,btohqsg
Definitely. Best if seller agrees to let you bring to a workshop to check.The bare minimum we have is LTA inspections  which sometimes is really inadequate.,btohqsg
er.. i tot it covers cars bought from second hand dealers?,btohqsg
U read their s n p,btohqsg
Even if have  by the time u enforce it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
On paper it is covered. In actual fact can you mediate out of it is another question.,btohqsg
If you claim X is faulty  I am pretty sure dealer would say otherwise.,btohqsg
They will say it‚Äôs ‚Äúwear and tear‚Äù‚Ä¶. Surely everything in the car is subject to wear and tear,btohqsg
2nd hand car mkt is really a lot of pattern,btohqsg
I salute them lah‚Ä¶ really‚Ä¶ a simple biz of buying from A  keep  sell to B also can have so many issues,btohqsg
okay la.. we can have our own experience but facts are facts. lemon law  is there even for used cars thru dealers.  though yeah i wont rely on it so better check gao gao myself,btohqsg
Second hand any pro can advise what to check,btohqsg
Other than the sta which I find useless,btohqsg
Oh I remembered one bro here asked about buying 2nd hand car rite? Be wary if the dealer let you test a car that has low fuel.,btohqsg
Dealer always put 145 or 150 points check,btohqsg
New or 2nd hand   all low fuel level leh.No 1 is going to give u free fuel lol,btohqsg
No  but the agent may try to hide wear out parts that can't be discovered unless you take the car out to test drive,btohqsg
I see some only allow testdrive in car park,btohqsg
Best is you have your own trusted ws to check for you,btohqsg
No ah  when I went for test drive  the fuel bar left 1 or 2 and the low fuel warning came out  so I didn't want to take it to highway test,btohqsg
When I drove back  discovered wheel bearing worn out,btohqsg
And he dared to claim their workshop has inspected. Didn't even noticed the 12v battery is already approaching 3yrs old,btohqsg
Says so much about their ws or integrity,btohqsg
A Bentley driver who used his car to push a security officer outside Red Swatiska School has been referred to the public prosecutor.https://cna.asia/3DVAdli,btohqsg
The prosecutor will determine if criminal charges will be brought against the driver,btohqsg
He can also ask police to investigate further,btohqsg
It used to be $500 many many years back.. Not sure about now üòÜ,btohqsg
"And dun get their so called ""package"" including seat covers  floor mats  even sound system cos very easy to kena chop",btohqsg
Around there ba...some quoted me 600  some 300. If they quote low  rest assured they'll recover it from other aspects,btohqsg
Good afternoon ! I‚Äôm new here ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
Can I check  is Honda Vezel good? üòÅ,btohqsg
Hmm... depends if u like SUV? Different people really different opinions. Haha,btohqsg
Haha I don‚Äôt mind SUV. Just looking around. Fuel efficient  good car ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
If can afford Hybrid is a good take i guess u can take a look at hybrid models like toyota Raize or Etc. I guess they are good,btohqsg
Go test drive and feel it =D No harm heh,btohqsg
Just that  my friend mentions that hybrid is normally around 30k more  so we save that much cost ? üßê any idea?,btohqsg
Hmmm... IMO at least.Hybrid is Fuel Efficient than the non hybrid counterpart. if u really can calculate u can try doing so. Or maybe check if anyone here have both and can give a better advise =D Hahaha.,btohqsg
Yup. Petrol version CVT gearboxPocket friendly,btohqsg
If you don't drive 200-300km per day.Don't need Hybrid,btohqsg
QasQai new model or? The back seat machiam hard hard stiff stiff. Sit long liao will YaoGu hmmm,btohqsg
Spent some money and redo seat .Redo in Malaysia üòâüëç,btohqsg
Haha thank you for the suggestions !,btohqsg
Best is to go around test drive and do ur homework hehe,btohqsg
If you were thinking of honda vezel  give the Citroen C5 a try. Similar price & its comfortable,btohqsg
Can also consider Peugeot2008/3008for 1.2 L turbo as well üòâ,btohqsg
Both Citroen & Peugeot uses the same engine. Just that C5 has hydraulic suspension cushion üòÑ,btohqsg
Er...can I mentioned a bro said something about a conti being priced similar to a Jap car? üòÅüòÅüòÅ,btohqsg
Am i missing something here? I mean he wasnt driving nicely  obviously impatient  tailgating and overtaking from the left but stuff like this happens all the time including from msian cars. Why the need to single him out?,btohqsg
I think is the whole team,btohqsg
