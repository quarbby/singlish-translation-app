you mean those credit card deals like citi-agoda 7mpd?when i used the linkhttps://www.agoda.com/en-gb/bonusmilesand then activate shopback  the citi icon disappears. so i don't think they are stackable,btohqsg

excluded means dun count to 800 min spend,btohqsg

Hi all  I would like to know more on the redemption of SIA plane ticket.How long does it takes for SIA to inform you for tickets that are on waitlist ?What are the chances of getting the tickets if i am in the waitlist ?,btohqsg
Your second question If you put yourself on wait list should get the email immediately. They can tell you any time the waitlist clears. Then you need to go in and confirm. Waitlist will be cancelled two weeks from the flight if not available.For chances  only SQ knows. But certain routes are easier  especially those see you them offering SE? Means demand is low.If it‚Äôs peak travel period and popular location  will be almost impossible.,btohqsg

Hi  does anyone use the Dobin app that was recommended by Chris in his YouTube video?https://youtu.be/Nkg_X7_hG6Y?si=Ds-92RLIrA7TR5GaI‚Äôve recently registered an account with it and I‚Äôm wondering about the safety/security of connecting my bank accounts to the app.Anyone has any thoughts  experiences about the safety of it?

I don't know if this is against the rule here or not. Please delete this message if its against the rule.If i want to borrow money from a lender or bank ( for renovation loan ) will the amount of unsecured credit card and cash line (GXS loan) affect my Chance of getting the loan ? And will it affect the amount i am able to get ?Let's say I have around 15k worth of credit limit on all of my card and cash line and I want to borrow 30k and my annual income is around 33k.,btohqsg
Usually the max loan amount will be based on the following factors1. Whether you have good credit bureau score (e.g. defaulted payments  declare bankrupt  took DRS etc)2. the quantum loan amount that you are applying,btohqsg
Personally  with an annual income of $33k  might be a challenge to secure a loan of $30k from most approved FI under a single name‚Ä¶ but no harm trying firstüôèüèº,btohqsg
I recall dbs has 6x salary for reno loan EIR 6.75% with 33k annual will be tough to loan the 30k,btohqsg
the remaining 8% HSBC promo was credited yesterday.,btohqsg
1 I have not bankrupt or have DRS2 I will be applying this month,btohqsg
So much mean at max I can borrow up to around 18k even if I 15k worth of unsecured debt ?,btohqsg
I find it difficult to participate as need to register first then execute trade.  How would I know how many trades I would execute as it depends on the mkt condition.  And they need 5 days  I think  to complete the trade execution.  Will give it a miss.,btohqsg
Does using kris+ to scan qr code and pay with uob krisflyer via Googlepay count as an online transaction?,btohqsg
It doesn't matter. U get 3mpd anyway with kris+,btohqsg
It depends what card u use as payment method. For example: If your GooglePay (GPay) set Citi Rewards Mastercard (CRMC) as payment method  it'snotcountedas an online transaction. If your GPay set UOB evol as payment method  itis countedas an online transaction.,btohqsg
can use Amaze+crmc on google and applepay for Kris+. Anyway uob kf get 3mpd on kris+  no need care online or not  dun need meet 800 SIA related spend either,btohqsg
Hi gurus  i need to pay few thousands to my reno ID  what would be best way? They gave me UEN paynow (but without the QR code).Im thinking to use grabpay < uob amex < EGA for 1.3%.But i realised grabpay needs to scan paynow QR then can pay to UEN paynow?thank you! üôèPS: im not looking at cardup method  cause ive maxed out cardup opp on other things.,btohqsg
Hi  for sc bonus saver account does smart credit card eligible for spend criteria?,btohqsg
No the bank won't likely give such loan quantum. MAS already limit max unsecured credit amount for 12 x monthly salary. Bank won't be setting themselves to fail considering your credit card balance,btohqsg
For ocbc 3.3% savings promo  the tnc did not states anything about fresh funds being incremental.?,btohqsg
Try this to convert UEN to QR code.https://www.fullstacksys.com/paynow-qr-code-generator,btohqsg
