Ah  wanted to get euro r as first car leh,btohqsg
Hear u like that say same as stock scirocco need pay to service gearbox,btohqsg
As long you buy used sure got things to do one,btohqsg
Already very lucky if previous owner take care,btohqsg
But sometimes things fail for no reason,btohqsg
Mine when I bought  had to do up my brakes and exhaust,btohqsg
Less then a month  change all brake pads  abs pump  brake master cylinder  etc,btohqsg
Exhaust don't know weld how many times until I dulan order new hks,btohqsg
The car already 15 years old... The mileage all maybe can go to the moon and back,btohqsg
honda any way to check back real mileage,btohqsg
Truth is  a 200k mileage car that was maintained well will be better then a 100k mileage car that don't have proper service,btohqsg
My advice is track back the previous owners. Find out the history of the car.,btohqsg
I was lucky that my car after track back was my friend's friend ex car. The guy I bought from didn't know anything about it. So I found out more from the owner before him,btohqsg
I wanted to get as first car actually,btohqsg
But maintenance + the rising prices,btohqsg
It's a great car really... But you need to do it up nicely,btohqsg
Every unit is different... Because you can zhng it to your liking,btohqsg
Maintenance I think of it as upgrades üòÇ,btohqsg
"Easier to click ""add to cart"" when you tell yourself this to improve the experience",btohqsg
Don sell la. euroR good car,btohqsg
You the one selling leh not me üòÇ,btohqsg
whats the highest car mileage yall know on a car?,btohqsg
is 470k counted as insanely high,btohqsg
I seen before 400k highest personally,btohqsg
Depends on the age of car,btohqsg
To me mileage doesn't matter  what matter is the previous owner got take care the car or not,btohqsg
But bad side is you can't sell your car in your expected pricr,btohqsg
But if the engine was rebuilt and the car properly maintained would this matter?,btohqsg
Depend wad is Ur main purpose to buy such a carüòÑ,btohqsg
And of cuz be prepared to spend $$$,btohqsg
but was asking bc thats the mileage fr my dad car,btohqsg
