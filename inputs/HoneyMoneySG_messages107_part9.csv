Hello guys  anyone is familiar with the UOB lady's card for MCC code of 7011(Hotel)  which category of spending should i select?,btohqsg
For shopee online  can i use amaze + citi reward cc to earn both points ?,btohqsg
No need to use Amaze  can use crmc direct.,btohqsg
Citi rewards card can just tap paywave  don't need to be contactless ?,btohqsg
To earn miles I want to use cardup or ipaymy to pay rent   which credit card to go ?,btohqsg
CRMC only give 4mpd for ONLINE transactions,btohqsg
4mpd for selected in-store retail shopping too.,btohqsg
For amaze + citi reward cc   as long i spend to $1000 . Beyond $1001 n above use other cards correct ?,btohqsg
Keep it to below 1k  if not minimum fee is either 1 percent or 50cent,btohqsg
Hi Guys and ladies.Given a choice.DBS world woman card Vs uob kris flyer .Which one would you choose it for travel.,btohqsg
Only kids choose lol  i take both whichever suit my needs lol,btohqsg
For insurance premium pay monthly   which credit card to go ?,btohqsg
Hi  can I confirm paying via FairPrice App using UOB KF will earn me the 3mpd?,btohqsg
So I have to spend $800 accumulation of it on SIA group first   then after 3mpd earn for online shopping and etc ?,btohqsg
Uob krisflyer have specific list of mcc that count their online shopping cat,btohqsg
The 15k crediting is to maintain premier status? Can it be manual transfer 15k every month? Like what we are doing to clock the everyday+ rewards?,btohqsg
When you upgrade to hsbc premier?,btohqsg
Is this true even for international contactless?,btohqsg
International or not does not change uob tnc,btohqsg
Only use outside of ApplePay GooglePay contactless  is to use it online at selected MCCs,btohqsg
U can. Just know that hsbc will reject if you sign your giro form digitally if you are setting up giro payment for another name.Need to print without signature then sign with ink for them to accept. If u are setting up giro to pay your own cc bill then digital signature is ok.,btohqsg
For HSBC Visa Platinum  isit all purchases under these categories qualifies for 5% rebate?Is this on top of the 1x rewards points?,btohqsg
15K Fast in is to fulfil HSBC premier requirements  can just fast in. For everyday rewards for premier is 5k in and 5 transfer out. So normally I just pump in $15k monthly on first of each month and withdraw out in 5 transaction to settle the requirements,btohqsg
Hmmm im still facing problem linking the UOB ladys and krisflyer MC. Anyone else still the same? I use manual entry with apporval from uob tmr app.,btohqsg
Tks. I just saw the salary credit on HSBC website as well. Just to check so FAST salary in from other account under our same name will be counted as well?,btohqsg
Yes as long as from non HSBC bank,btohqsg
any idea what other better alternatives to pay income tax? can pm pls  willing to sign up under your referral,btohqsg

According to the T&C  the quarterly cashback will be credited to the card account in the month after the calendar quarter.In this case assuming if I were to continue to charge the same amount i.e. $2001.35  for that month  my credit card bill is actually $2001.35 - $200 = $1801.35?If I don't do anything else  it means that the next quarter I will only qualify for the $1000 tier cashback right? Unless I spend the $200 to make it to be at least $2000.,btohqsg
some cardholders do not earn reward points naymore,btohqsg
It's based on your spend not on your bill,btohqsg
Is that a very old Visa Platinum range? Mine starts with 4512 97,btohqsg
Not sure it‚Äôs on their cc website,btohqsg
Hi just to check  anyone knows to accumulate the most miles per dollar on the SC Smart card  does it matter if online or offline transaction? Can't seem to find it anywhere.,btohqsg

Anyone has experienced Google pay to someone by mistake  and know how to get the person to return transfer back ?.,btohqsg

OCBC always require from corporate account. Whether GIRO/FAST/PayNow.,btohqsg

I called DBS bank but they claimed it is with GooglePay and DBS cannot to anything. Had been searching high and low how to reach out to Google pay,btohqsg
CardUp has a calculator tool. You should try it,btohqsg
Honestly to me if send wrong and the person refuse to return then take it as donation already. It's your fault the moment you send wrong number.Unless you want bring up for legal recourse. You'll probably end up spending more than what you transferred wrongly.,btohqsg
10x points capped on $1000 eligible spend posted in calendar month,btohqsg
if me I will also not respond or reply you. A lot of scams nowadays,btohqsg
