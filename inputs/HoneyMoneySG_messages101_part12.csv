Can someone share with me the uob one credit card terms and condition please.For some reason it‚Äôs not on their web page,btohqsg
"Just a ""trick"" to share if have hospital bill to settle and also wanna buy big ticket item. For hospital bills can call in to request for temporary credit increase and its allowed up to 4x current limit and they will ask u how long u need say one month as that is the maximum allowed. So for example my credit limit is 20k. They increased to 80k. Then i settle my hospital bill now 67k. Clear the amount within the one month and just before the deadline reach go and buy your big ticket item (car or house) then use the card. I did it for my car previously and 80k at 1.5% i got 1200 ""discount"" for the car",btohqsg
Don‚Äôt have lei. It‚Äôs give 2023 one,btohqsg
usually buy car cannot use credit card other than for depositif the dealer let you use credit card means they already marked up the machine fee into the selling price.,btohqsg
"I bought my bm performance motors alexandra and paid the ""deposit"" 80k using the amex after their promotional offers and saleslady further discount",btohqsg

How do you know uob will update TnC every year?,btohqsg
actually car loan is one of the more expensive loans.HDB loan is very good yes.,btohqsg
Back then it was a damn good rate 3.1% p.a.,btohqsg
To me anything below 4% must take should take,btohqsg
you need to understand how car loan works...,btohqsg
The EIR isn't that number ....,btohqsg
Where to get this promo code? Anyone has any idea?,btohqsg
True.. Anyway i no longer buy cars after buying 5 room flat and 2 condos.. Sg cars now really not worth buying.. 2005 was the best,btohqsg
Agree. I got into a fight with my PI dealer after winning a $2 COE!,btohqsg
That was the era of $1 and $2 coe,btohqsg
I still looking ard for the uob promo code to pay axs üòÖ,btohqsg
Depends on your household composition and where u stay.Some households and locations no car cannot one.,btohqsg
Landed really need car too inaccessible. But i only buy a hdb 5 room and 2 condos all beside mrt. Plus i give each of my household member $400 a month for grab all linked to my credit card (total less than a monthly car instalment),btohqsg
How come your gst only 8%? The hospital print wrongly? Should ask them to amend. Then u can charge more to the card and earn more cash rebate.,btohqsg

Hi  first time using Citi rewards and amaze card. For offline purchases  do I just use the physical Amaze card and need to avoid using the Citibank Apple Pay card?,btohqsg
Always safer to just use amaze + crmc for all payments. But be cautious on the $1k local monthly transaction quota by amaze.,btohqsg
