Gemini only 1 wrong2 didn't put 第几声,btohqsg
Nice so 3.80 SGD per lot,btohqsg
nah man it's $38 per lot,btohqsg
Oh yeah my brain le dead,btohqsg
I missed the first 10¢ dividend lol,btohqsg
Yeah just checked it was 6.02 for Acendas Capitalland Reit,btohqsg
for sq to have such high yields,btohqsg
Last I heard their Debt to Equity Ratio was damn high,btohqsg
Idk if they managed to trim it by firesale or just cost cutting,btohqsg
depends on industry avg aso ig,btohqsg
Most of the forecasts place it at their hold or reduce 💀,btohqsg
Bro their Gearing Ratio is hilarious,btohqsg
U mean the region or globally?,btohqsg
can't compare your SIA group with like airasia or batik air,btohqsg
I mean airasia has a net gearing of 0.90,btohqsg
Most in the industry is basically trimming their assets rn,btohqsg
ehh u can't rly compare SIA group with AirAsia tho,btohqsg
Cannot compare with JetBlue and Delta as well,btohqsg
Still higher than the average according to analysts,btohqsg
The dividend might pose an issue tho cuz the 38 cents is from free cash flow,btohqsg
wait why the report from feb 24 but revenue breakdown from FY2021,btohqsg
I think some of the data is outdated but probably still valid in their thesis,btohqsg
I dun have access to a bloomberg terminal now,btohqsg
But probably will say the same shit,btohqsg
Their forecast ain't looking good due to entry of new competitors,btohqsg
The dividend probably a ruse to increase share price for now for executives to cash out,btohqsg
Companies like doing that lmao just do buybacks the share price skyrockets they excerise their options,btohqsg
share buybacks have tax benefits compared to dividends,btohqsg
company do share buyback price increase i sell no capital gains tax,btohqsg
Yeah but it's SGX last I remember no withholding tax,btohqsg
dividend i got 30% withholding tax,btohqsg
SGX suspect abit useless apart from the major companies,btohqsg
SGX is just for the Banks REITs and Oil and Gas,btohqsg
But their lots at 100 makes it too capital intensive to buy in bruh especially for banks,btohqsg
who said investing was for poor people,btohqsg
We poor people are their liquidity,btohqsg
I just found out this word has two pronunciation,btohqsg
So yes it's important ok that's why SGX all the shares at times I am the only one in the market,btohqsg
Wonders why no liquidity be like:,btohqsg
Imagine if NYSE closed for Lunch,btohqsg
Return back to Open Outcry trading and maybe I understand,btohqsg
Guessing all the polys and ite stand as dumb then,btohqsg
U cannot go ri u dumb,btohqsg
Jk dont take this to heart  china student only recognised tsing hua and bei jing university,btohqsg

those 中介 are the scum of the earth haha,btohqsg
many chinese students are undiscerning and go to schools that offer admission to anyone with a pulse,btohqsg
usually those students come here are because their parents dont want them to go too far from china or they recieve offer from local u,btohqsg
if not is come here take private diploma den go back and claim they  ‘海外名校海归“ status,btohqsg
I dun even know how my shit parents got the psc scholarship,btohqsg
They are nowhere near supportive  in fact saying im the cause of my problems,btohqsg
I have heard of SIM  MDIS  Kaplan  PSB. never heard of JCU,btohqsg
They are more supportive to my sis,btohqsg
My dad was like ‘coz she is still a baby  i think u were more mature when u were her age’,btohqsg
Ok im mature and independent doesnt mean they just leave me w my struggles and claim i caused them myself,btohqsg
They didn't have such problems themselves because they were successful when they were young  so they don't understand,btohqsg
Very true…failure is not in my mum’s vocabulary,btohqsg
Anyone here in uni doing business,btohqsg
Im here for u love ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘,btohqsg
Im here for u love ❤️ 😍 💖 ❣️ 💕 💘,btohqsg

I think my class had a few tho but parent letter 💀💀,btohqsg
I think i only ponned 2 sch events to study for exams lmao,btohqsg
I mean cca is to hv fun but hmmm,btohqsg
The thing is my exco chance in band would be much higher than in shooting coz i suck at it…plus performing arts will hv more portfolio like syf and sch performance,btohqsg
In sports u need to be chosen to be involved in nsg,btohqsg
Clubs even worse in a sense,btohqsg
Except interact club coz got a lot of via sort of things,btohqsg
The ??? one is interactive games club IGC,btohqsg
But it's all towards coding & 3d printing side,btohqsg
So if U don't do those U R kinda fucked,btohqsg
But meh stickers can flex that we do stuff for the sch,btohqsg
Lol but i feel there are ppl who dun really give a damn,btohqsg

Ok la at least for me I'll see it thru,btohqsg
I see some ccas like igc alot just pon,btohqsg
2/3 of all projs R completed,btohqsg
“I think we have to go back to what's the purpose of the CCE lessons ” he said  emphasising that these are not intended to be history lessons. The minister said MOE held discussions at length since the outbreak of the latest round of conflict last October. The considerations were how to guide students and what materials to curate for different levels to help them understand in age-appropriate ways.,btohqsg
Btw u step down from cca alr?,btohqsg

Explainer: Why netizens are blocking A-list celebrities on social media for being silent on the war in GazaBlockout 2024 is a new online movement that targets celebrities who are seen as being insensitive or even supportive of the atrocities being committed in Gaza.➡️https://tdy.sg/44JeTN7,btohqsg
I am reminded of how some Chinese celebrities were lambasted for not rallying behind One China. So tough being a celebrity — they’ve got to look good  be talented in their art  find ways to gain popularity and clout  and pretend to be politicians. I wonder why can’t we leave celebrities to just be good at their art and performances,btohqsg
Like  what's the best strategy to picking a uni degree if you don't already know what you want to do?,btohqsg
I'm probably going to be limited to private uni too  so...,btohqsg
If celebs so choose to take side  so be itI feel celebs should be left to decide if they so choose not to express their sides — if they even take sides at al,btohqsg
Not eligible for SUSS PT and didn't do well enough for any of the local autonomous unis,btohqsg
real like no offence but ive seen ppl in kpop online forums admonish kpop idols for not speaking up on social issues. sorry to be harsh but their job is to sing dance and perform not to educate people on whatever is happening in the world rn,btohqsg
Ye. I think it is an unfair demandI think we have no business pressurising celeb to express their views on such matters,btohqsg
More I don't know what I'll be good enough at to do as a job,btohqsg
i mean the article is not true that they do not. most of them do,btohqsg
Eh  sorry I don’t quite get what you mean. Do you mean that some celebs listed here have been inaccurately listed as showing support?,btohqsg
no the today article says that A-list celebrities are being silent. maybe only small majority of them.,btohqsg
Erm  I don’t think the article meant there are no A listers that expressed viewsBut those A listers that are silent are being condemned for keeping quietAnd I think that is unfair to those who are silent,btohqsg
That's probably not going to work out well jobs or emigration-wise with a private uni degree especially,btohqsg
yes those who are silent are blocked by both sides,btohqsg
choose which school you prefer of those in Partnership with SIM first,btohqsg
honestly unsure what's the difference between any of them,btohqsg
besides UOL and UOW for CS,btohqsg
which ones are exam-heavy and which ones are more project-heavy?,btohqsg
Assessment & AttendanceStudents are normally assessed by continuous assessment in the following form:AssignmentsClass testsLaboratory exercisesPractical laboratory testsPresentationsProjectsTutorial exercisesSome assignments and presentations will be group-based. Assessment may have minimum achievement requirement necessary to pass the module.Most modules have a final examination at the end of term.,btohqsg
are you applying to become a teacher?,btohqsg
for UOLAssessment & AttendanceModules:Each module  excluding the Final Project  is assessed either by coursework or a combination of coursework and a written examination.Each coursework element may consist of multiple items of assessment. The pass mark for any element of assessment is 40%.Students are required to have a portable computer for assessment.Final Project:The summative assessment for the Final Project consists of both coursework and a written examination  weighted in the ratio 80:20. The written examination consists of questions relating to the project.,btohqsg
Keen interest in nurturing students in their learning journey,btohqsg
tbh smth like this you could just ask chatgpt for the pointers and flesh it out on your own,btohqsg
i thought like if you are applying for a program like this you should alr have a rough idea of how to answer those in mind,btohqsg
but yea if rly cannot think then ask chatgpt vomit smth and then u refine lor,btohqsg
qualities and competencies for teaching are subjective  so if you ask chatgpt for what qualities are needed to be a teacher etc you're gonna get a consolidated list of pointers then you see what applies for you and write about it,btohqsg
idk if u wld be surprised but,btohqsg
teachers can v easily see through smoked answers,btohqsg
like for example how i will answer smth like this is that i am calm and adaptable so i can handle unforeseen circumstances in the classroom (eg. Student acting up) + adapt the teaching methods to suit different groups of students with diff learning ability,btohqsg
but ofc this is just a random example that needs to be more fleshed out la,btohqsg
i think when you're presented with a formal question like this  not everyone can just put out a good proper answer just like that,btohqsg
and end of the day the subjective aspect of appealing to the organisation you're applying to matters,btohqsg
since u ask like that  i throw u a question backhow do you think you can add value to the kids under you?,btohqsg
"after a year or two with you  what do you think you have that will make the kid go ""wow i think (s)he was a great teacher and i will miss his/her teaching""",btohqsg
so in a sense you think you can create interesting lessons for your kids?,btohqsg
"ok then maybe to reframe that into a ""quality""",btohqsg
maybe can be smth to do with creativity?,btohqsg
plan lessons that keep students captivated,btohqsg
as for uni  I'm mostly tempted by UOW and UOL,btohqsg
Half my hw collection  what hobbies do y'all have?,btohqsg
UOW I think is group work more than individual work,btohqsg
UOL I think is individual work more than group work,btohqsg
yeah  for CS UOW offers what is probably Singapore's last decent dedicated game dev degree at the uni level  but UOL also offers International Relations and Politics and Economics  but I'm not sure whether the exam-heavy weightage of UOL will work against me,btohqsg
what is your previous achievement for project based and exam based? good or bad,btohqsg
all other courses for UOL is 100% exam based,btohqsg
exam based worse than project based  but both not great,btohqsg
one of my best grades EVER in NUSH was for the prose section of my creative writing portfolio project,btohqsg
is there a ticket that costs $21?,btohqsg
$21 for the confetti at the stadium maybe,btohqsg

I can't tell whether they're still active or not based on their social media,btohqsg
I suggest you can visit during SIM IT Day | Saturday 18 May | 10am - 3pm or email them to ask about it,btohqsg
why do i get more and more random messages on tele,btohqsg
my friend got like 6 scam telegram job messages tdy,btohqsg

he started off w a 'hi  are you free',btohqsg

"bruh got some guy keep on messaging me asking me the same qns..then ask me my age i said it. he said ""im sorry""",btohqsg
"i send him back a ""?""  he said..nvm",btohqsg
it was me thinking in my head,btohqsg
then a week later he texted again,btohqsg
"1 day later he asked me ""do you want to make money?""..im like ""No?""",btohqsg
"then he said ""im sorry""....like bruh",btohqsg
The SCDF firefighter who died in the line of duty has been identified as 30-year-old Captain Kenneth Tay Xue Qin.The regular officer was a stellar rota commander who completed training for the role in July 2018.https://str.sg/5ANq,btohqsg
then i ignored...another wk later  he be like 'do you want to practice kissing',btohqsg
oh its this kind of recurrent ones are,btohqsg
