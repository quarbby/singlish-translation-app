CHR can only sit in front,btohqsg
Behind is claustrophobic.... learnt that the hard way,btohqsg
buy y still so many used a phv,btohqsg
I sit in front of high SUV aso feel nauseousðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
hahaha lowest can lie all the way one,btohqsg
Coffin car can lie flat all the way at the back,btohqsg
Fit   freed   Prius all much better lol,btohqsg
And chr car look so big   the backseat is like for children,btohqsg
CHR rear seat is marginally better than 86brz,btohqsg
now sg got maserati one haha,btohqsg
Vezel not as bad but fit is better,btohqsg
I test sit inside the new vezel  very spacious also,btohqsg
jazz is a damn good car ever since it came out,btohqsg
Not really leh. The screen reset while driving all the features work. Including gears signal and autopilot?,btohqsg
My bmw digital dash black out before also. Stil can drive.Tesla the screen black out all your driving controls still work.Suggest you donâ€™t fly any Boeing and airbus since they are all glass cockpit. If the screen black out how? Better go back to propeller plane with manual gauges,btohqsg
So atas ar! Hahah. Prius don't make sense ley.. mileage so low but cost high,btohqsg
Actually my Vw golf 12v went flat before. I lost all power steering and became harder and harder to turn  and I couldnâ€™t press the brakes much also. Finally when I coasted to a stop I couldnâ€™t engage the electronic parking brake  and the car couldnâ€™t be put into park.,btohqsg
Headroom is better in the fit. Vezel is spacious overall.,btohqsg
Jazz more comfy when doing bend and such   vezel I felt like flying off,btohqsg
There is redundancy in the tesla. When I reset the screen while driving. Auto pilot still works  when I signal I hear the signal sound. The screen is purely for the navigation and ancillary controls. The brakes are still not fly by wire and neither is the steering.Same thing with every modern digital dash display car that I drove.,btohqsg
I think is car too high,btohqsg
I was referring to the main computer doing the drive  not the screen.,btohqsg
Itâ€™s the same as your traditional car ecu. What if it gets fried while you are driving and the steering lock engages and you canâ€™t depress the brakes too?,btohqsg
If 12v power is cut to your normal car you also lose control of your eps and brake booster,btohqsg
Not the same leh. I was referring to the computer that is responsible for overriding the drive by wire control  not the computer that is responsible for reading your driving input,btohqsg
Tesla isnâ€™t drive by wire for steering and brakes. The brake pedal is still linked to the master cylinder. So is the steering which is linked to the steering rack. So in the event that computer dies you still can steer the car and apply brakes for it to come to a complete stop.Maybe you are referring to Mercedesâ€™ and Toyota with brake by wire (no actual linkage) and steer by wire (the new bz4 EV has an option for a wheel that isnâ€™t linked to a steering rack  just sensors). Even the Alfa romeo giulia is brake by wire That might be more dangerous ironically ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Also Teslas have permanent magnet motors  means whenever current is not applied to the motor to move it  theres regenerative effect to slow it down  unlike a traditional car that might go into neutral and coast at high speed. As long as you do not apply throttle itâ€™s always slowing down due to the inherent nature of permanent magnets.Isnâ€™t this safer than a potential ICE car which may lose engine brake if the brakes fail and the gearbox is in neutral?,btohqsg
Strange Tesla doesnâ€™t use brake by wire. Isnâ€™t this already all standard for todays cars.,btohqsg
Actually have you tried turning off the ignition while driving before? Iâ€™ve tried that on a first gen Vw with keyless and immediately the steering locked and the brake pedal was almost impossible to be depressed.So I think you donâ€™t understand that actually the modern cars are probably safer ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
tried before  currently sending this message from heaven,btohqsg
What no.. you think every car is like merc and bmw crash prevention system meh,btohqsg
haha but in some cars cannot turn of the ignition when driving  safety feature,btohqsg
Brake by wire means no physical linkage from your brake pedal to your master cylinder.Only Mercedes uses that with the SBC (servo brake controller) on some models and the giulia .Otherwise most cars still have a mechanical connection from the pedal to the master cylinder,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s this nasty case in America where a few Toyotas accelerate non stop due to pedal failures. Getting struck or something. The case garnered so strong attention that Toyota is forced to pay bullies in damages,btohqsg
Ya lucky I tried it out of curiosity in a big open field and realised itâ€™s dangerous.But u can imagine thatâ€™s what happen if you lose 12v power,btohqsg
Oh gosh. I hope it doesn't become a standard. Seems either expensive or unsafe,btohqsg
might not make it to heaven if the maserati breaks down halfway,btohqsg
How's the data plan over where you are? I hear the cost is sky high.,btohqsg
So actually modern cars and Teslas are actually safer unlike what@skylar313and@YGY1988thinks lol.I mean if you really think thereâ€™s a computer sitting in between your brakes and steering with no redundancy then it might be safer to buy a 70s car with throttle cable and unassisted brakes.,btohqsg
Iâ€™m aware of this. Alfa has this long ago. Throttle wire also,btohqsg
not too good but at least there is free storage from the cloud,btohqsg
All powered by servos getting signals fork controls,btohqsg
Most cars are throttle by wire  thatâ€™s fine  but the brakes still have a mechanical linkage to the master cylinder so in the event of a power failure you still can apply pressure to come to a stop (albeit without brake booster assistance),btohqsg
At least iPhone users can use lightning for charging,btohqsg
Some say.... Even charged by Thunder....,btohqsg
hahaha this one so funny sia dumb ways to die,btohqsg
Dont get me wrong. I believe it is a requirement that brakes have to work even if car ignition are turned off  unless you installed a battery kill switch,btohqsg
How do you explain the brake pedal locking when I managed to switch off the ignition in a Mk7 golf?,btohqsg
I don't own a MK7 golf  so I can't answer. lol,btohqsg
They either have to invent some failsafe mechanism or something. I remember many years ago my friend pulled out the boss kit of the mtech steering wheel he wanted to take a look and the steering locked forcing me to brake. Luckily I wasnâ€™t going fast and this was on Scottâ€™s road in front of tangs. ðŸ˜‚ scary,btohqsg
