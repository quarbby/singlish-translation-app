He might still be lurking tho…,btohqsg
yep yep! too obvious to not know yk? HAHAHA,btohqsg
time to play game and then sleep,btohqsg
i wish i had the power,btohqsg
but mans raised the white flag,btohqsg
:o  well I guess it’s just me then HAHAHA,btohqsg
using other people's nudes to troll is intolerable,btohqsg
next time he ought to use his own,btohqsg
uk whenever i see the chat piling up w msgs i realise it’s u,btohqsg
don’t really know anything else in life besides trash,btohqsg
doesn’t mean need to make the rest of tolerate trash,btohqsg
well  too bad I guess HAHHAA you guys need to tolerate me  was recommended to be around patient people,btohqsg
Before i leave this group  i said again  i not a scammer. But i troll scammer just for fun,btohqsg
nahhh her being annoyed is justifiable  I’m just an intolerable piece of trash,btohqsg
I think I’m being too intolerable HAHHAA,btohqsg
wait who said@parrotssflyawayywas in the wrong,btohqsg
omg I’m so sorry  the way I used English to phrase my sentences did not convey the message I wanted it to,btohqsg
she thinks by agreeing w wtv i say will piss me off but uh no,btohqsg
just trying to say she need not ‘relax’,btohqsg
HAHHA omg is that the vibe I’m giving you? Im just agreeing with what you’re saying because you’re speaking facts girl!,btohqsg
I’m sorry if that’s what I’m coming across as doing,btohqsg
i replied to the wrong msg HAHAH,btohqsg
Also guys if anyone likes punk rock or grunge rock pm me!!,btohqsg
What are some examples of pop rock bands,btohqsg
uh i listen to avril lavigne,btohqsg
wait i don’t think anybody left any disparaging or condescending comments about nt students,btohqsg
but i’m certain that we do not condone such a behaviour of looking down on anybody here,btohqsg
don’t look at this chat right now  it’s becoming too toxic of an environment!,btohqsg
I pointed out your English errors even before you told us you’re an NT student. We have nothing against NT students bruvva  y’all cool,btohqsg
yea you want an explanation you get one here,btohqsg
Your english is so bad. So that means is a insult?,btohqsg
it’s not an insult it’s literally an error we r pointing out so that you can improve on it,btohqsg
Tbh i cant distinguish btw heavy metal and rock songs 😀,btohqsg
oh um sorry but Jennifer edited the following message which originally said something along the lines of ‘you may now leave thot’,btohqsg
That’s from a meme  it means nothing really lol search it up,btohqsg
hm okay.. but we mustn’t assume that others won’t be affected by it,btohqsg
if you’re sensitive to other peoples feelings that is,btohqsg
He’s not offended by that  he wrongly thinks we’re treating him differently because he’s an NT student,btohqsg
Excuse me ah dey.Even if dun speak lah leh lor in some what? US stream or uk stream. They won't correct me also what.,btohqsg
from an outsiders perspective  that was quite discriminatory and rude to be very honest haha,btohqsg
it’s ok! it’s turned into quite a toxic environment to be honest,btohqsg
if u not happy ppl look down,btohqsg
why r u adding fuel to the fire…,btohqsg
i think katie left the chat isit idk eh,btohqsg
Isa typing an essay of rebuttal,btohqsg
I understand :) but  not everyone understands those as you clearly realise since you said ‘there’s bound to be understanding gaps’  so it’ll be better to be more sensitive to others feelings in my opinion. (Just my opinion  don’t have to agree though  I’m just a piece of trash remember HAHAHA),btohqsg
unless you want to ofc :),btohqsg
You have enforced the opponents points  you must improve on your rebuttal for a more balanced and through essay that considers multiple perspectives,btohqsg
oh I’m sorry..just giving my opinion although it has no value,btohqsg
sorry for wasting your precious time though!,btohqsg
oh  I’ll take that into account! thanks for the feedback ya!,btohqsg
Now now Bobby we do not tolerate discrimination in this server,btohqsg
we all have our own opinion on things,btohqsg

shes not even toxic the toxic one is katie,btohqsg
i think she was more of the one to make peace on the grp,btohqsg
sureeeee didn’t seem like it from my perspective,btohqsg
But whatever floats your boat ig,btohqsg
uh what did i say that made you think this way,btohqsg
Omg I don’t want to be the victim now,btohqsg
nono if you got a problem with me i rather we clear it first,btohqsg
cos out of everybody you only singled me out,btohqsg
it’s so obv u r picking on her for no damn reason,btohqsg
Oh lol sorry  forgot to mention@parrotssflyawayyand@abcdef42526,btohqsg
well then i don’t think you know what was going on the entire time,btohqsg
when she helped y’all defend on ur behalf when katie was here,btohqsg
yea but also making groundless claims that jennifer was looking down on nt students when she clearly didn’t,btohqsg
i don’t think you rly wna side with katie sir,btohqsg
what in the world is gg on,btohqsg
Hi being extra as shit rn,btohqsg
And I’m now the victim  oh no,btohqsg
fr eh this whole saga ended yst alr & we weren’t even rly involved,btohqsg
is anyone here early enough to sum up what just happened,btohqsg
katie started accusing jennifer of looking down on nt students js cos jennifer was correcting his english,btohqsg
then isa sided with katie which is a troller n a pervert that send boob pics to random gc,btohqsg
oh jeez how did that come down to you guys fighting among yourselves??,btohqsg
then say as@bigfatbarneyn i were trying to make peace   Hi had to intervene n be extra,btohqsg
if no i suggest you take it and leave,btohqsg
you know what guys  take a deep breathkatie / alvin is honestly just trolling  he's oftenaddedby others (scammers most of the time) — but i agree his actions can lead to disagreements and whatnot but to each their owni think the looking down on nt students is a misunderstanding and an honest mistake that both jennifer and alvin made  and it's okay bc we all misunderstand sometimes!among the 3 of you  great on trying to make peace! i think we all appreciate it but take a deep breath and take it slow  idt we wanna fight here anyway ^^it's too early to argue so i hope you all have a gd day ahead 😅,btohqsg
isa kept siding alvin when hes a troller,btohqsg
Um bro what’s wrong with trolling heartless scammers,btohqsg
But wtv  ig if you don’t like it  you don’t like it,btohqsg
plus it’s so obv isa isn’t trolling,btohqsg
whatever literally so extra probably a boomer,btohqsg
Whats with the anti boomer vibes here,btohqsg
don't ask or it'll prolong 🥲👍🏻,btohqsg
welp if u're that curious  here u go,btohqsg
ehh we're just waiting for an unbiased summary,btohqsg
i like how you just call the ppl you dislike the toxic ones HAHAH,btohqsg
this is my cue to leavehave fun guys,btohqsg
Haiz people nowadays dun like us boomers,btohqsg
yes let us all breathe pls no more conflict,btohqsg
Tf is this figure of speech,btohqsg
i like how hi deleted all the msgs,btohqsg
cos Hi realised she was in the wrong 😭😭,btohqsg
bruh i like how she deleted everything except this one,btohqsg
Can I ask why is he a scammer?,btohqsg
And isn't it normal to have grammatical errors?,btohqsg
By the way  I'm not siding anyone I just want to hear both sides,btohqsg
(I'm rly sorry for asking a qn unrelated to the topics above but-) anyone in nafa fine art knows about whether they have any bias against digital art..?,btohqsg
then isn’t it better if somebody corrects ur grammar so u can improve?,btohqsg
Errrrrrr do u rly rlyyyyyy need perfect grammar in normal conversation?,btohqsg
yea i don’t get it also i believe so too,btohqsg
if you notice it’s almost every single msg he sent that included a grammatical error,btohqsg
Yes it may be better but not sure if you know that it might actually make them feel bad about themself being not grammatical inclined.,btohqsg
And do you even know why?,btohqsg
exactly so isn’t it better that we help him,btohqsg
I would say its still ok so long the main intended message is conveyed and not altered,btohqsg
if his grammatical errors accumulate  the whole msg he is tryna convey may be misconstrued,btohqsg
He admitted to scamming and trolling  scroll up,btohqsg
He scam the scammers by lying about his identity as a girl,btohqsg
trolling is acceptable  sending boobs is never acceptable,btohqsg
if the accusation is backed up by proof through the constant biased msgs he sent then it’s not called accusation,btohqsg
Do it in moderation.. yall 3 kinda overdid it somewhat la.. He isnt a scammer btw he helped me with math b4 by sending out qns one lehh. I even have evidence yall😅,btohqsg
So you speculating about me being a 2nd acc?,btohqsg
Kk i take back my words,btohqsg
He is a good math Cher and I know him irl,btohqsg
if y’all scroll up it’s just people fireballing statements of us being toxic,btohqsg
Issok I lazy fight w immature ppl :),btohqsg
What if he doesn't speak English at home?,btohqsg
Everyone with bad Grammar gonna be corrected by y'all?,btohqsg
why is an action that is meant to be out of goodwill be skewed to a bad one,btohqsg
y r u're english so good omg,btohqsg
sometimes when people get pressed at trivial issues  it may be due to their insecurity of that particular issue,btohqsg
why are you liking your own msg then waiting for your fellow friends to do the same tho,btohqsg
i’m not liking my own msgs? wdym HAHAH,btohqsg
Birds of the same feather you mean,btohqsg
goodbye she didnt get the sarcasm,btohqsg
i still dk what you have against me eh,btohqsg
with this much salt in this gc i guess ill pass,btohqsg
yong brather i’m literally the impartial one here,btohqsg
no actually i am the most impartial and wise one,btohqsg
why is an action meant to be out of goodwill now skewed to be bad*,btohqsg
"At times when you think in that perspective  you'll end up doing things that seem unintentionally intentionally  selfish/ignorant/mean. I think this is where  practicing mindfulness also comes in as wellI mean the other ""party"" could have done better in choosing the ways to respond to your msg but some people just cant take a joke.. When that happens  stuff like that happen lol basically both parties are in the wrong bla bla bla. I mean its pretty obvious at least to me  when you realized its no longer a joke anymore the moment he said im from NT yea the beginning of when it all started.Yall 3 continued and literally crossed the boundaries. He kinda misintepreted  as yall criticising his grammar altho i do suppose u guys said yall out of goodwill correcting his grammar mistakes but  you kinda didnt notice the signal /  ignored itIt can happen to most if not all of us and im not faulting either party for it because shit just happens la. Take note can alr",btohqsg
really  in my defense  i didn’t mean it as a joke cos if you scroll up i only corrected one grammatical mistake before he even mentioned he was from nt,btohqsg
if y’all misinterpreted my msgs  then i am sorry for not being direct enough,btohqsg
i’m sure u meant it as a good will,btohqsg
bruhhh it’s on you if you think otherwise eh,btohqsg
VALERIE WOKE UP AND CHOSE VIOLENCE HAHAHA,btohqsg
furthermore  i see it as him using nt as a mere excuse to make the situation more awkward for everyone,btohqsg
Did you know being toxic can get u ban from the group,btohqsg
i doubt she rly cares HAHAHA,btohqsg
Why is NT even an insult,btohqsg
v stands for violence js like my name,btohqsg
Idk why its even thrown around here,btohqsg
I think people shouldn’t apologize for their own insecurities,btohqsg
Amazing how a silly online embroilment can be elongated like a thread on wheels,btohqsg
Yes its amusing and interesting.There's alot of takeaways from this. Its a pity if  ppl cant see/understand it.,btohqsg
just as amazing as you deleting a chat i guess,btohqsg
oh sorry my bad for my grammar i meant clearing a chat because deleting a chat is only on one side whilst clearing is on both side sorry sorry i'll correct my mistakes,btohqsg
doesnt seem like an attack though?,btohqsg
what other rock bands do u listen to,btohqsg

iirc maroon v started as pop rock,btohqsg
Weren't they considered Pop Rock before Overexposed? (Their 2012 album),btohqsg

hellos! need advice/tips on how to do well for SRQ part (a),btohqsg
"Take the SRQ (a) question like your Chinese Paper 1 email writing since they also ask for ways and suggestions.Eg In your opinion  what can be done to address the needs of those in the lower income group.

Any way/suggestion is accepted as long as it is realistic and feasible.This method always works for me and enabled me to get L3/6 or L3/7 consistently during exams.",btohqsg
Heard of the format what how why ?,btohqsg

hi friends does anyone here have experience with google data studio?I'm trying to highlight the lowest scoring attributes in my bar chart  but the colours system is wonky and it's not letting me do that ;-; been playing around with case/parameters/colour by dimension but nothing's workinggg,btohqsg
Its a very niche tool. I dont think ull get much help here,btohqsg
Might wanna check the products own forum page,btohqsg
I've tried the forums but nothing's working gahah  just trying my luck here. Thanks tho :'),btohqsg
Have u tried splitting the attributes into its own bar,btohqsg
Im assuming ure trying to do this,btohqsg
Where yellow blue and red are attributes,btohqsg
But u can split em up in their own bars,btohqsg
Should be easier to color code,btohqsg
Not quite  it’s a normal bar chart  not stacked - just wanted to highlight the ones that were the lowest to draw the viewer’s attention there first. But it’s fine haha  I appreciate your effort nonetheless ^^,btohqsg
Hi ! Does anyone have any VIA organisations ( for class based size ) to recommend ?,btohqsg

It's like how my brother took his exams in a separate room but with additional time,btohqsg
it would be on record lor,btohqsg
It's like quite unfair for some people,btohqsg
Imagine yourself being in a solo room without pressure. You can probably do better than those in halls or classrooms with pressures.,btohqsg
My brother took in a separate room and he did better than what everyone expected,btohqsg
I didn't sit in hall for mine so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,btohqsg
Yea for mine.  It doesn't really matter tho,btohqsg
I'm in uni that's why I asked,btohqsg
If not why would I be asking for assistance¿,btohqsg
Oh you entered comp science through IB?,btohqsg
I know for meds if you got AA q low chance alr,btohqsg
Haha it's like how my friend getting rejected from RI with 3points cuz of AA,btohqsg
Idk how is that possible but I'll wait for my friends posting for meds,btohqsg
No. Our local universities do not discriminate between those with AA and those without.,btohqsg
We'll have to trust what they say in parliament lorh,btohqsg
If what they say is true  and we don't have any reason to suspect otherwise,btohqsg
U tell me it doesn't show on the results slip?,btohqsg
if you have the same Rp  then its just up to ABA,btohqsg
dont they consider you for ABA if you dont get in purely by RP?,btohqsg
according to the moe  no it doesn't,btohqsg
if you dont trust the moe  then idk who you can trust alr haha,btohqsg
hello i kinda need advice on this   im a j1 taking GELm and i wna change to PCMe… i realised i screwed up since psych =/= psychiatrist so i cant diagnose people and im very much struggling in geog and literature tho i scored pretty well for humans fr O’s. But this would also mean i needa change class + pw 😨😨😨 which is very scary aaaaa,btohqsg
U need to talk to ur level head I believe,btohqsg
Heartware SG do you want to join? however it is a long commitment like a few months I am a part of this year NDP as part of the Youth Planning Committee if any of you would like to join can pm me,btohqsg
Oo omg that’s interesting! I’ll let my class know and update u !,btohqsg
I think it depends on two things1. Will this diagnosis be made available to your employers2. How conservative your employer is,btohqsg
I honestly don't think it matters that much if your grades are good. And today I think most good employers (I'm talking about big tech firms etc) are pretty accepting of these conditions if you are good at your work or skill-set,btohqsg
Honestly I wouldn't think so much because ADHD is something that's quite common. Firstly  I'm not even sure if you necessarily have to declare it in the future. But secondly  even if you do I don't think it'll affect your prospects if you are competent and have other redeeming factors (like yknow  you're smart and can get the job done)Anyway if you think about it - the only employers tt this wld be a huge consideration for would be employers you wldnt wanna work under anyway? Like if your condition is affecting you so much at the moment  the workplace that you enter by not declaring the condition would probably not be conducive for people who have said condition,btohqsg
u can report to TAFEP if you feel discriminated,btohqsg
If you want to change better do it ASAP tho. Don’t continue waiting or it’ll be too late and if you want to change you’ll have to retain.,btohqsg
btw if my sciences not very STRONG like my o’s not that gd fr science is it advisable 😟😟😟,btohqsg
like i think sciences can mug (?),btohqsg
mug is can mug arh. you'll have to put in extra effort since you're also likely a few chapters behind for each subject,btohqsg
O's arent always a good gauge,btohqsg
If u think it's better than currently then go for it,btohqsg
Just rmb H2 sci hv pracs,btohqsg
But first of all did u meet the sci cop,btohqsg
O level chem and h2 chem is damn different,btohqsg
I see. Your call la. Personally I offer a hybrid combi and did badly for physics and wanted to retain to switch my subject combi to switch physics with history even tho I promoted but they rejected. But after repeatedly pestering my sch I might be able to retain. As another person mentioned you need to meet the sci COP if not don’t bother,btohqsg
Ok then if you personally think it’s worth it approach the year head asap I guess. But you need to be really sure you can catch up and also do well. You might need to get private tuition for physics chem math first,btohqsg
omg if uw change u better change fast,btohqsg
u've alr missed out on a few weeks of content 😭,btohqsg
Yeah also normally when the sch approves request to change subject combi in term 2 it’s just one subject switch. If u change it entirely it’s gonna be very hard IMO and need to convince the sch u will be able to cope and catch up,btohqsg
i think h2 chem and h1 econs should be q okay to catch up with considering where most ppl are rn   i personally struggle w h2 math but idk ur math standard (+ i don't take phy),btohqsg
Physics they tend to cover the easier topics first so should be easier to catch up as well tho if ur foundation is bad it can still be hard. I would think math should be the hardest for most ppl in that case,btohqsg
ok so i take GELm i only cannot lit,btohqsg
PCMe i may face the problems of having 3 PCM die,btohqsg
i think u should try to make a decision by the end of this week and submit to the sch,btohqsg
later too late then they reject sia,btohqsg
Ya so that’s the issue then if that happens there rly was no point taking. You have to ask yourself whether if u switch u think you’ll do better. And also think about whether ur future desired uni course needs them,btohqsg
looks at the BGHM chad in ejc 💀💀💀,btohqsg
Anyone here knows which is worse geog or history lol,btohqsg
If I retain I want to take history and geog together and think I might die,btohqsg
i wanted gh at first lol…,btohqsg
Geog and history isn’t allowed together in ejc isn’t it?,btohqsg
And it’s not anywhere in the list of approved subject combi’s,btohqsg
I asked even for the propose ur own subject combi part would it work or not and he was like nah,btohqsg
maybe my friend is trolling me 💀,btohqsg
So it’s ur friend la not u?,btohqsg
ya ofc not me why would I do that to myself,btohqsg
And h3 math on the side as well,btohqsg
I wan take h3 geog sia,btohqsg
I thinking of doing GMEh if I retain  but was thinking if I can ask to do 4H2 then drop the one I’m worst at (unless if I somehow Do well for all) since now I legit don’t know what would be my worst subject and I want to get some sort of insurance. My raw is 11 so idk if they’ll accept tho. But one of the points I could use to increase the chances of my application is that my econs is solid and if I spend as much time on it as I would do for a H1 I can still cope,btohqsg
There’s 2 ppl in my batch that I know of that did H2 geog and history together,btohqsg
U took lit in sec sch or ur languages very strong?,btohqsg
My brother didn’t do lit in sec sch but yet he was able to get A for a levels,btohqsg
His English was pretty good tho so I think that’s why he could do it,btohqsg
But lit is not for me my English rabak,btohqsg
Honestly do u want to retain to switch or don’t want,btohqsg
Like u think not worth it to spend one more year,btohqsg
Why not faster ask ur sch lol,btohqsg
If u think u will be better off and it’s worth the extra time,btohqsg
But also I must mention ur sch no vacancies when I called them up. I was so desperate to retain that after my sch rejected my own application to retain there I asked a few other JCs for a transfer and all rejected me for various reasons like no vacancies no transfer policy etc,btohqsg
It rly depends on oneself tho cos my brother rly enjoyed lit and did well for it despite not taking it at Os,btohqsg
what if i dont enjoy it,btohqsg
shld i just stick with it and get the A since no one genuinely likes their subj combi anyways,btohqsg
If u think u would do better with chem phys or math than switch lol if not just stick with it,btohqsg
And ya like almost no one enjoys every subject they tend to love like at most one or 2 and hate the rest,btohqsg
so in my case if i only hate lit,btohqsg
i might hate geog sooner or later but oh wells,btohqsg
Perhaps if by the end of the year it’s still the same,btohqsg
i feel like im just convincing myself to tough it out lol but 😭😭😭😭,btohqsg
maybe if i see again i’ll fry,btohqsg
I mean if it’s only lit you hate maybe just switch it out for something else,btohqsg
Wah adm dept working at this timing one,btohqsg

hai! is it possible to do well if u dont have passion fr subj esp A LEVELS,btohqsg

It's possible to have passion and still not do well,btohqsg

idk if its worth this sacrifice,btohqsg
ig try to talk to ur subj head... see if anyth can be arranged,btohqsg
could i just ask  why did you choose the subject,btohqsg
I think if its for math etc it's worth it,btohqsg
Bc math is needed for alot of stuff in uni apps,btohqsg
I rly feel lit is a subj that needs alot of intrinsic passion bc there's rly not much extrinsic payoff in it,btohqsg
bc the most common arts subj combi is GELm,btohqsg
yeaaaa my class populated w HELm ://,btohqsg
yall know where to get documents printed for at a cheaper rate,btohqsg

yo  can anyone explain if pentane has a higher density than its isomer 2 2-dimethylpropane,btohqsg
Straight chain alkane molecules are more closely packed than molecules of their branched isomers  hence the former is denser,btohqsg
wait isnt pentane has a greater volume so low density?,btohqsg
you can't just follow the trend when choosing combi...,btohqsg
stares at all the econs bandwagon science students 😭,btohqsg
U should always follow the superior combi of PCME,btohqsg
Can literally go any uni course,btohqsg
Dont pick the inferior BCME cannot even go BIO Med eng with it,btohqsg
NUS reject me from bio med Eng coz no PHY bg in either o or a lvl,btohqsg
NTU offered bio eng to me via ABA,btohqsg
BCME only if u really aim medicine or dentistryor you just love memorisation of information.Or so I think,btohqsg
is it worth it to take phy tuition for o levels even tho i won’t be taking it in jc,btohqsg
Well do u need ur phy grade to go JC?,btohqsg
if u need it for your L1R5,btohqsg
i have seen students put so much focus into Chinese tuition even though they are likely not using for their L1R5 😒,btohqsg
Wait till you see JC chinese tuition,btohqsg
yes I saw before too. Scratch head,btohqsg
JC chinese hardly even makes a difference in rank points,btohqsg
so what's the point of getting tuition for it,btohqsg
Clb students looking at this be like 👁️👄👁️,btohqsg
I would say if you can get a S for MT  you are technically safe.,btohqsg
But would it make a difference rp? Not really  especially those who score 80+ rp or score less than a B for MT.,btohqsg
not me writing a mt compo right now,btohqsg
why does jc mt even exist,btohqsg

Ramadan Kareem to all of our Muslim friends!,btohqsg

Hold on let me do the banning,btohqsg
Help me with a srq suggest question.,btohqsg
Why is there hybridisation in McDonald’s Singapore.,btohqsg
why as in  why does it happen?,btohqsg
maybe think about what about mcdonald's sg shows you that there in hybridisation and think about why it's occured,btohqsg
why would mcdonalds want to change its menu instead of offering the same thing they offer in the US?,btohqsg
Does anyone have nanyang poly school of design group chat?,btohqsg
Shows off different and unique cultures while preserving the western culture ?,btohqsg
U can ask in nyp gc. If u want the link for nyp gc can just dm me,btohqsg
Not biomed  but my sis-in-law was from there and working as cardiotech now,btohqsg
She doesn't like lab life so she went allied healthcare,btohqsg

Actual Physics Olympiad: 5 hours for 3 theory questions  5 hours for 1 practical question.,btohqsg
We had 2 practical questions for ours,btohqsg
I thought I remembered wrong. Went to Google.Really 1,btohqsg
hello! for chinese oral is 41/50 good?,btohqsg
For me  it's extremely good. I consider passing good.,btohqsg
same as asking  is 82% score good?It's bad if it is primary school level.,btohqsg
Wtf kou u went phy Olympiad?,btohqsg
Like that how to be chad,btohqsg
Are prac also round 2 like Bio olympiad ?,btohqsg
Where if u dun pass round 1 u wont go round 2 kind,btohqsg
I was referring to the international standard,btohqsg
It's a single competition where everyone sits for both theory and practical,btohqsg
I guess makes sense need more money to do a bio prac than phy… so need to filter,btohqsg
The one I went for had magnetic fluids as practical,btohqsg
As well as some high-speed cameras,btohqsg
Wanna ask  if I got a offer for JPAE can I accept it and Enrolled into that poly  but meanwhile appeal via DAE to another separate poly?,btohqsg
But you can start the course first,btohqsg
If you feel that you dislike it   you may apply for a transfer.,btohqsg
But the downside is   you probably need to wait for the next year or something if the course has started for quite awhile,btohqsg
Oh okay thanks I tot can cause I saw this in reddit,btohqsg
That ‘s what my friend did.,btohqsg
So can accept the course then appeal also?,btohqsg
Looks like a 🐟 in the sky.,btohqsg
Cat in the hat as an aeroplane?,btohqsg
Like do you think companies (biz accounting course),btohqsg
Will like allow brightly dyed hair or something,btohqsg
No. Accountants are expected to be robots. Robots do not have hair,btohqsg
Also accountants are expected to sleep only 4hrs a day. Having hair means more time needed to maintain it. No hairs means more time to rest.So almost accountants have no hair:p,btohqsg
Lol the past few days I have 3-4 hours of sleep,btohqsg

hello! is it normal if u find the emath tys qns easier than the prelim papers?,btohqsg
So if you find the sch prelim papers are too hard and may make u demoralised u can just focus on doing timed practices for TYS first,btohqsg
I believe prelim papers are deliberately set harder than the tys in most instances,btohqsg
Is Plymouth degree recognised in SH,btohqsg
Anyone know where I can donate my IB books QwQ?,btohqsg

err what's that ah HHAHAH is it sec3 topic????,btohqsg
u could use a countdown widget,btohqsg
Hey guys! Just wondering  would y’all be interested in a similar app by SGExams ?,btohqsg
ya HAHAHA but i learned it ltr in the year,btohqsg
What are the features yall usually require ?,btohqsg
Integration with Google calendar and clock,btohqsg
i guess something similar to what google calendar has- ability to categorize by colour- ability to choose colours even with hex codes- timetableothers- countdown to exam/test/impt dates,btohqsg
target setting would be good too (?),btohqsg
okok Ill take this up with the team and see if we can get something done regarding this. Let me know if yall need some specific features,btohqsg
yk apps such as everyday (habit forming? app)  or tracker apps?something like that but to track progress (in terms of grades),btohqsg
interesting but what in your words means measuring progress. Is it grades overtime or how many questions did you do or your error rate,btohqsg
honestly adding all 3 would be greatbut i initially meant grades over time,btohqsg
Its an interesting concept nonetheless hahaha,btohqsg
