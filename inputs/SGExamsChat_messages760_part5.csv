Actually I accidentally hit a pedestrian before coz i just learnt and then not really stable yet then didnt stop in time coz it was a downslope,btohqsg
altho some ppl do rely on CC mods to pull gpa up,btohqsg
there's people that can only do core mods (me) then there's those that's saved by non-core mods,btohqsg
Tbh i take electives to pull up my score,btohqsg
I've seen a cyclist speed towards a turning log picking truck then blare their bells like no tomorrow,btohqsg

dunnid cycle within 2 yellow lines la ngl as long as  you're cycling in a straight line and not taking up too much of the road can liao imo,btohqsg
