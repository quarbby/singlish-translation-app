Only had a photo from the workshop.,btohqsg
Hmm. That sounds like a good idea but I‚Äôm not too sure about where I can actually order one and I‚Äôm not too sure about the technical part of it.,btohqsg
No pics of the turbo itself?,btohqsg
No I didn‚Äôt receive any pics from the workshop. This workshop has got a pretty bad rating however it‚Äôs the one the dealership is working with  thus I can‚Äôt choose.,btohqsg
So I was hoping some experts here can educate me on the turbo parts and whatnot. üòÖ,btohqsg
Hmm this is an intercooler part,btohqsg
Oh thanks for letting us know! Usually for turbo chargers  there‚Äôs inlet and outlet pipes right?,btohqsg
I think it is this part..,btohqsg
Does the green part go to the intercooler? Or engine Bay?,btohqsg
I think the moment you go other workshop fix  you would end up helping the bad ws got rid of your car problem cos they can deny all responsibilities,btohqsg
Yeah.. so I‚Äôm gonna wait and see if my dealer is willing to help cover this as the car is only 2 days old. If he‚Äôs not and he‚Äôs gonna shed responsibility  then I‚Äôll bring it in to my own ws for reparation and bring this to CASE.,btohqsg
this car is a lemon  ur gna have more problems afterwards,btohqsg
Report to case immediately. Later they just say in the process   you damage the car yourself . Y go repair ?,btohqsg
I‚Äôll await till Wednesday to see if my dealer is willing to do the reparation  otherwise I‚Äôll seek help from CASE as per your advice.,btohqsg
I think you can go report tomorrow. If Monday they not doing anything immediately then they won‚Äôt do anything,btohqsg
No need to give chance de   you pay for the vehicle and you are wasting the $$$ not putting to good use,btohqsg
Eh ur vehicle in ws u still paying for it,btohqsg
Repair shud be done @ their cost,btohqsg
Hahaha. Noted with many thanks. I‚Äôll see to it tomorrow in the morning.,btohqsg

But serious   I admire you . You still can endure  and wait for the dealer to get back to you . I will go bang their table Liao,btohqsg
