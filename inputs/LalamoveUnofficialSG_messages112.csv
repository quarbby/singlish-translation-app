Damn sian…..yesterday received letter from hdb. Open n it’s red letter for parking offence at sago lane 25 may. Can’t even remember what’s that for. Car cam video also overwritten already,btohqsg
Sago lane there new parking lots have. You never in lot is it$70 for parking at double yellow line / coach bay / taxi stand ?,btohqsg
I thinking should be for parking loading/unloading,btohqsg
Doesn’t make sense ? How long you park,btohqsg
15-20 min  run to take order n back,btohqsg
Later try appeal see can or not,btohqsg
I park like 7.38pm the summon timing 7.45pm in their later,btohqsg
Why loading and unloading cannot park ?Is legit u van and am unloading,btohqsg
Red color one leh. Ask me pay 13 June,btohqsg
Later I take pic show u guys,btohqsg
maybe is under HDB liao lo,btohqsg
u parked at no parking side ah,btohqsg
That’s why I blur. I usually park either normal lot or loading bay,btohqsg
then how come get that ticket sia,btohqsg
1 week later receive  I also cannot find back car cam video see I park which lot,btohqsg
usually the letter will indicate the offence,btohqsg
I know. But obey what sign? I also dunno what’s that for,btohqsg
Failure to obey signs exhibited in the parking place.,btohqsg
The only thing I can think of is parking at loading/unloading lot,btohqsg
I no balls one leh  don’t dare anyhow park roadside etc,btohqsg
Kena this letter I also blur,btohqsg
Pay also need to know why mah,btohqsg
Yea challenge themIf turns out you really wrong then need to double the fine or not ah 😂,btohqsg
No harm trying appeal. If successful  save the 70 bucks,btohqsg
That’s like how many trips to earn back,btohqsg
Yellow loading bay wording got signboard written unload/load time usage allowed in city ??If have  outside that timing stated not allowed to park at all time 😂,btohqsg
Worst case scenario is pay the $70 lo but pay also want know why mah. Not blur blur pay. Anyway  try appeal  cannot then LL,btohqsg
All hungry liao be it gov or private. So parking pls take care.,btohqsg

i can say almost all the restaurant will tell customer tat they had aldy hand over to the driver v early. Than we kana. Sometime when e customer allow me to explain. I show them my apps on the pickup request time.  But most of them are too angry n keep scolding n never want to hear,btohqsg
worst is @ condo  press intercom no ans  call no ans and u follow resident went up and he open door n yet still scold u.,btohqsg
They can assume but we cannot. Totally ridiculous. Ha ha,btohqsg
But they say my account ok lei.. Not suspended.. Since yesterday.. Kns,btohqsg
Yes I did.. About 5 times.. Already,btohqsg
Haha how they justify abnormal behavoir,btohqsg
Maybe banned by Oddle. Are unable to take other jobs?,btohqsg
Try to take non Oddle jobs,btohqsg
But the jobs keeps coming in..,btohqsg
Even If I tried.. Other jobs.. Still cannot..,btohqsg
Yep. Ardmore Park  have to use their service entrance. Went there once to pick up an item - the customer was ready for me to pick up at the regular foyer but security asked me to go in by the service area instead.,btohqsg
Yup. I think that time I was picking up two dresses for alteration or rental.,btohqsg
Atas apartment security is strict especially Ardmore Park  must use service lift.,btohqsg
The security folks themselves also kena this everyday at work. I also feel bad for them.,btohqsg
Llm don’t care one cuz for one order they will be 3-4 riders snatching the job haha,btohqsg
Finding say 20min late for pickup than next msg told u need to pick up within 30min,btohqsg
I pickup on time and delivery on time. Jus tat restaurant call me after 5min asking me where am i. I replied i am still queueing to exit the carpark. Tat restaurant manager complaint to LLM.,btohqsg
There are always ass holes around. Many look down on drivers,btohqsg
This I agree. These restaurants/vendors/senders always think we are low class uneducated labours. I always tell them today I am a delivery person but tomorrow I can be your customer! Shut them up.,btohqsg
Hi bros. Singapore land tower.  Where can park?,btohqsg

Have you seen the 23% increase in 97 octane petrol in JB? Within a month hor.,btohqsg
A lots FNB restaurant will close,btohqsg
There is no cheap parking nearby man. Unless u are fast enough.,btohqsg
Speaking of which I heard well over a decade ago  taxi drivers in HK don’t just drive around and hope to get a passenger  but only when there’s a confirmed rider before they move.Maybe the friend who told me that smoked me  I don’t know. But in LLM and “on-demand” services  cruising around burns gas a lot more  especially with start-stops.Hybrids and EV folks might have it better but EV cost is mad too  although we are on the way of phasing out ICE. 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
Some can in n out within grace. Some got place chop chop Park n pick/drop,btohqsg
Have you guys been receiving LLM CS call? Not sure why today they keep calling me for me order .. ask me estimate what time I reach  even when my order is at 2pm when I m only 2km away from pick up ..,btohqsg
They clever  know sg drivers go over pump….lol,btohqsg
Then stupid enough to kena the many more Malaysians who have more premium vehicles?,btohqsg
They think by doing tis ways will improve customer service. Lol.,btohqsg
I told them to stop calling me n disturb my driving otherwise mayb cause accident n I will claim from Lalamove...this is harassment n disturbence...not improve CS,btohqsg
Yea im honestly not sure why they're so stuck up on calling drivers??,btohqsg
"The last call even better  I ask told  I m 1km away n 10 mins ahead of the pick up time  why keep calling me today  she just cut off my line n ""call ended""",btohqsg
This message auto generated after each message??,btohqsg
Hi all  ask a silly question. May I know as part time LLM  is my additional pocket money be subject to income tax? Will Iras be able to trace my extra income?,btohqsg
If total annual income above $22k  it is taxable. Unlikely to trace though  small fish.,btohqsg
You mean on LLM job right?;,btohqsg
yes  all income sources. if combined annual above $22k  is taxable.,btohqsg
you dont need statements though  for self employed income below $500 000. Just declare a number  if you want to declare your llm income.,btohqsg
You mean self employ ownself declare any amount u want,btohqsg
Do we need to show llm account,btohqsg
I don't think they can cancel my job before pick up schedule time. That will be unreasonable.  If I m late n they call n  I don't answer  yes..,btohqsg
I kana a few times before,btohqsg
They can cancel the job anytime they want,btohqsg
couldnioawbe booted from the group for good for all these repeated external links stuff? half a day's worth of text probably came from this user...,btohqsg

I attached photo of my puncture tyre n also two person trying to help me...,btohqsg
I don't know how to resolve the puncture tyre issue.. n yes the tyre is heavy hor,btohqsg
FYI Vivo n harbourfront connecting pathway closed. Plus carpark shutters down. Got some fire alarm. Strong chao tar smell. In case got any bro taking vivo orders. Side doors can open,btohqsg
I once kena flat tyre too and delivery was late and the organizer (hotel) wanted a refund as they said the food did not arrive well. So I text the customer to ask if he received the food in good condition as the hotel claimed that he complained. He said he didn’t complain and the food was perfect but arrived a little late. So I showed the text to CS and they LL cannot deduct. We must work smart. This stupid CS can say that it was my fault that I did not maintain the car and also did not avoid the nails. This CS is damn stupid. Told her off and asked her how can one see nails on the road when driving !!!!,btohqsg
They win... I feel more tired to argue with them then to take 10 jobs,btohqsg
We now expert liao. Won’t let them deduct so easily.,btohqsg
They are a bunch of jokers. Talk without sense. Ha ha,btohqsg

Famous for not punctual. Another one is Taste Paradise. Customer wants the food at 6.30pm. They book delivery at 6.30pm. They are willing to pay extra - cash as tip but customer not happy when delivered. We are the ones who faced the customer and not them. Some understanding ones will listen when explained but majority won’t and vent their frustration on the drivers.,btohqsg

Anyone have the latest list of Lalamove discounts for petrol?,btohqsg
Wan share my bad experience. Recepient paid by paynow. Witnessed him complete the transaction. When i left he quickly did a reversal. Luckily i checked and reported to CS. CS gave me his number and to contact him directly. Screwed this foreign guy over only then did he trf again. Tried to claim the bank reversed his trf. I told him don’t talk cock bank will never do that it’s him who trying to cheat ppl of their hardwork and time.,btohqsg
Wow. I didn't know can call bank n do reversal.,btohqsg
I tio before a foreigner. I need to keep call him to do transfer den he do. N keep telling me he had done but not done.Another is a restaurant. I waiting next day i call back the restaurant. Where is ur payment. She say i end job cannot see my number anymore. I say wonderful.,btohqsg
Trying to rob people of hardwork and precious time these idiots. Not about the amount but about the effort tio bo?,btohqsg
Hmmm okay. But isnt it weird if the bank is the one tt reverse for no reason,btohqsg
I can reverse a paynow payment to AXS when paying my bills. Seems in certain situations (paying to an organization?) there is a short window for reversal.,btohqsg
but i think direct personal account to account cannot reverse at will. would be a huge loophole.,btohqsg
Office table and chair ask motorcycle pickup 🤣🤣🤣,btohqsg
Creating awarness to riders n drivers. Call the customer bef heading over to confirm order. Order confirm  when reach at location straight away cancelled.,btohqsg
If u contact lala CS   they will ask if u hv contacted customer before heading over . If I am not wrong U will get small compensation if u did call . If u did not then suck thumb Loh 😬,btohqsg
Yup i did call the cust bef heading over.,btohqsg

These type of mass multi stop jobs  they will come out advanced 1 2 days,btohqsg
But if No1 take  on the actual day they will have high price. The 2 I saw added $20 customer negotiation fee. 1 was 3 bt batok,btohqsg

"Or this mean it's repeated order  I take job from this customer b4.. can go back completed job to find my ""💖""?",btohqsg

U ytd take 2 grand hyatt job. Caught u😂😂,btohqsg
The s*** all come from past experience... Newbies only got questions to ask ..,btohqsg
Yup. But for me long distance not very good cos petrol expensive now n no phv to take rider back to town or what. That's y I say u have an advantage due to ur hybrid,btohqsg
Or else I also ok to take alot of jobs 😂,btohqsg
Hybrid big factor with the petrol prices now,btohqsg
That's y I don't bother kpkb cannot get job. I know got job  it's just whether the prices fit my consideration,btohqsg
Will be fun  we all go la kopi...,btohqsg
Anyway I always manage my expectations,btohqsg
So I everyday got job no job also happy go lucky,btohqsg
My expenses very low. Now less jobs I drive less petrol also tahan longer,btohqsg
Tues pump full tank  last until tdy then I pump again😂,btohqsg
I still go out very early evryday,btohqsg
It's whether I can get the job😂,btohqsg
Ytd my morning shift cui  but evening I do 4 jobs mah  so not lazy😂,btohqsg
My main diff from alot of u is I single no family commitments,btohqsg
I only have 3 jobs for last 4 days n all are advance one...if not can only smell flower  can see  cannot get,btohqsg
Sometimes is not no job. Is 在不对的时间和地方。when those job appear,btohqsg
Alot of normal jobs with base price yup can get.,btohqsg
But again for me is I choose😂,btohqsg
But is my own choice lah,btohqsg
Only when at 8+pm want go hm liao then I no choose😂,btohqsg
Cos at that time really almost no jobs liao😂,btohqsg
One sifu told me to be smart  don't any how take job  now I choose carefully.. otherwise waste time n petrol.,btohqsg
Yesterday cannot get any job .. the only 1 order was advance booking..,btohqsg
If I 1 pump can last long I will do same as u also😂,btohqsg
Cannot blame anyone cos the car is ownself choose 1 last time 😂,btohqsg
So just suck thumb n work accordingly,btohqsg
System siao already.. ? I in woodland  go Loyang won't be 68km away,btohqsg
Issit me? If so I not sifu hor. Anyway do what suits u n do what can help u make how much u need. Different strategies to pple with different needs n demands,btohqsg
I not lazy one..I m very hardworking...,btohqsg
I full time but alot of pple don't believe cos they see I choose job. But that's cos my target per month is not those very high cos my expenses low,btohqsg
It's true  different strategies for different ppl  depend on their needs n expectations...,btohqsg
I can still hit my target even with choosing,btohqsg
No .. I m at home.. no go jb,btohqsg
But for those who need a relatively higher amt per mth  then with the current llm situation  with choosing may be difficult to hit,btohqsg
Sometimes like this 1. Sometimes mine got show 99km away,btohqsg
Now my screen show if I go bedok  I m 78km away... Siao..,btohqsg
I no job  stay home  drink kopi n do housework...,btohqsg
Wash n polish car / bike...haha,btohqsg
I think I have to 🤐 or else bad influence,btohqsg
But hor  now got alot lazy ppl . That's why we got job.   That day I do I job $10... Woodlands to woodlands..from home walk 500m. Go pick up fried chicken  then just walk 1km deliver n  walk home. 35 mins job done.,btohqsg
Lol not everytime have this type,btohqsg
大人method is correct actually. Just that if u use non hybrid u will have higher cost than him,btohqsg
But yes can make $100+ gross from llm everyday  is not difficult. Its just for nett u might have to do abit more,btohqsg
For me my strategy is norm 1 full pump last 4 days,btohqsg
