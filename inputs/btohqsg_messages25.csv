Exactly. So like I mentioned above  all first timer in this project high chance will have a Q number  it‚Äôs only whether within supply or not.  Even out of supply but within the 300% also will get a Q number.Cos if u do the math there. First timer only is 2.1 for 4 room. The rest are all second timer which makes up the biggest number of applicants in the 4 and 5 room.So 2.1 it means around average 2 couples fighting to one unit. That‚Äôs why I say it‚Äôs 50/50 chance in getting a Q within supply,btohqsg
Actually the last sbf (Rivervale) . There are ppl whos profile missing but still got Q number.I was at that group that time.,btohqsg
Thanks! Do you remember if the Q numbers they got were within supply?,btohqsg
Not sure about that. It depends on individual luck too,btohqsg
Actually now I think I understand what is queue number within supply n queue number outside supply.Example  if there are 300 units  hdb will definitely issue  more than 300 queue numbers  say total 500 queue numbers are issued.So among 500 queue numbers  300 are within supply and 200 are outside supply. So these 200 are actually holding queue number but may not get a unit if the queue number is far behind and also assuming all queue no.1-300 did select the unit.In this example  Hdb cannot just issue 300 numbers  if so  all these 300 applicants will definitely 100% get the unit.,btohqsg
Yes. HDB issues queue number for 3x the number of available flats,btohqsg
So 100 units = 300 queue numbers,btohqsg
Ah I see. So always 3x?,btohqsg
If 300 unit x 3 = 900 que number issue.,btohqsg
The tips is to ballot for a project that has an application rate of 1 and below. You will definitely receive a que number within supply üòä,btohqsg
"""No la  it's really subjective. HDB doesn‚Äôt just issue 300 queue numbers for 300 units. They definitely buffer to account for those who might not select a unit. So even if you're outside the initial queue number  you still have a chance  especially if you're okay with choosing a lower floor or one of the less popular units.",btohqsg
Ya lor  this is why I said hdb cannot issue queue numbers based on exact number of units of the flat type.  Understand queue nimbers are issued 3x of the units of  the flat type.,btohqsg
So i guess  actually when you receive your queue number you will know whether your number is within the supply or outside the flat type supply.If there are 300 units of the flat type n your queue number is 310  then I believe it is known outside the supply so in this case you will have to hope that those queue number from 1-300 some dropped out or withdraw  in order to push your number into the selection chance. This is what I thought.Not sure it is correct & logical?,btohqsg
this is based on the assumption that ethnic quota has been accounted for. there were instances where applicants within the supply were unable to select due to insufficient ethnic quota,btohqsg
Thanks for reminding of the ethic quota.,btohqsg
Hi  any specific telegram group for the feb bto @ woodlands edge?,btohqsg
Which launch are you looking for?,btohqsg
Hi any specific group for tampines greentopaz?,btohqsg
im going to go for bayshore if i dont get holland V,btohqsg
How to go for bayshore or other project if can't get HV? Need to submit again or actually given a chance by hdb for you to choose from another project if your turn to select unit at HV but HV run out of ethnic?,btohqsg
E.gJune ur bto no. out of supply say 300/100 unitsthen Apply for Oct  ur queue no. say 50/100 within supply and decent numberbut if HDB ask u to go June selection  u have to select,btohqsg
Else june and oct both queue no. cancelled,btohqsg
Can I have group for perc clover,btohqsg
Oh so even given queue number but out if supply and haven't call for selection  I still can submit for Oct bto. Is that what you mean?  But after my submission then hdb call me for Jun selection  I MUST select otherwise both my jun & Oct submission will be canceled? Worst is that  I might became 2nd timer  is my understabding correct?,btohqsg
and yes as long out of supply can apply next launch,btohqsg
Hi can add me to Parc clover group as well? Thank you,btohqsg
Not yet launched but started construction at near Caldecott MRT,btohqsg
Don't know yet. Not yet launched. Saw in the Chinese paper.https://www.zaobao.com.sg/news/singapore/story20240730-4394619,btohqsg
This is next to 2020 project Toa Payoh Ridge,btohqsg
Not sure anyone have receive any notification of results for the June 24 bto ?,btohqsg

Hi i have a selection appt w HDB this 19th but not able to make it. Does anyone of u able to change ur appt to different date?,btohqsg
Did you apply as single or with a partner/family member?,btohqsg
With my child. 2 of us,btohqsg
Can someone else help you to select? You can complete this authorisation form for someone to help you select on your behalfRecommend this over giving up your appointment  as there's no way to reschedule  I think you have to walk in after a certain time and you will lose your original queue positionhttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/doc/EAPG-CSC/Authorisation-To-Select-a-Flat.ashx,btohqsg
Oh hmmm you can authorise someone to select on your behalf  that would be better than selecting at a later date as people behind your queue will go first and select,btohqsg
Hi  I'm asking for someone I know. Her bto is projected to be up in 2026 but unfortunately she is currently going through divorce. Is there anyway she can still get the house or she will have to give up the house and pay penalty? She has a kid.,btohqsg
If im not wrong  she can change the flat name to be under her and her kid,btohqsg
Still can get w her kids if both is Singaporean. But she alone must also can afford the loan,btohqsg
I heard its not advisable to put kids name for the flat right?,btohqsg
Is there any documents to submit/ any declaration to be made before receiving the keys?,btohqsg
Would you rather a roof over head or no roof over head for both you and child? If it‚Äôs a single parent (widowed/divorced)  you‚Äôd see they have only one choice,btohqsg
This was the best answer i found online for ur question..last time i was also curious about it,btohqsg
But i strongly recommend u to confirm with hdb or a lawyer first beforehand,btohqsg
If the kids is small can la. After MOP he is free already,btohqsg
When i get my BTO  my wife is long term pass and my son Singaporean  so im the only owner  my son and wife is essential Occupier,btohqsg
If the child is under your share and control  u can but case by case. Just get a lawyer to draft and appeal  best is you check with the lawyer during a consult what are the chances. They would know best,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need lawyer to draft la‚Ä¶ so chor sia‚Ä¶ Just write into HDB should suffice. Not their first time encountering such situations,btohqsg
Ya lor. Additionally lawyer = $$$$ ü´¢,btohqsg
I think what he meant was if u going thru divorce surely u would have to use a divorce lawyer. So just ask the divorce lawyer to help draft,btohqsg
if no missing profile mean high chance ?üòõ,btohqsg
Any chances of bto results being released this week ?,btohqsg
Honestly its all up to hdb  nobody can predict anything hahaha just wait bah  results will eventually come out:),btohqsg
if that makes you sleep at night üòÇ,btohqsg
all of it is speculation till we get actual results from HDB,btohqsg
Ya  some reported missing profile already,btohqsg
Any one has re-submitted HFE? You can't do submission of doc (eg payslips) until hdb send sms to you to ask to upload documents  right? Cos my HFE expire within 30days so I submitted  but I could not choose file to upload. Anyone here knows whether this is correct n in order?,btohqsg
You try emailing HDB via MyFeedback,btohqsg
I remember when i 1st apply HFE  then hdb sms n asked to submit payslip  not sure the same for a new HFE.Yes  I will send my feedback to hdb  thanks for the advise. .,btohqsg
Hi all  I got my appt to make thr 1st down-payment. Do you know how many times we can reschedule appt? And can we change unit at this point?Thanks for the advise in future,btohqsg
dk if there's a set number of times but try not to. But of course if no choice need to reschedule  I think HDB will continue trying to schedule anyway as it's about them receiving your moneyCannot change unit once selected,btohqsg
You can reschedule it. Write into HDB and set a date via MyFeedback@HDB,btohqsg
Just checking  re-applying for HFE letter no need to pay a fee? I just did and there was no step of payment,btohqsg
If apply as a married couple  for 1st appointment select unit  can we have only one of us to come down? Or need both applicants?,btohqsg
No need. Earlier I just resubmitted HFE too.Were  you able to upload document or just submitted then received email confirming your submission & stated hdb will either sms or email if  need to submit doc ?,btohqsg
Yes  was able to upload. No email received yet :(,btohqsg
Oh no upload doc but received email stated now processing  and will send sms if I need to upload my payslips/doc.,btohqsg
My main page 2nd box shows HFE application completed  3rd box shows Pending HFE letter.,btohqsg
applying HFE don‚Äôt need pay. only applying for sales launch then need to pay,btohqsg
just 1 of you will do. ensure that your partner has signed all relevant documents and bring along a copy of their IC. should the officer require more documents  you‚Äôll be given 1 week to upload them online,btohqsg
Ahh okay okay thank you üôèüèº,btohqsg
Do we need to bring payslip or income doc during 2nd appnt?,btohqsg
nope. only physical IC and must have singpass ready,btohqsg
Can't change unitAnyway  why are you asking about how many times can be rescheduled?Partner cannot attend appointment?Financing issue?,btohqsg
Likely get queue number since 3x queue numbers issued. But unsure of within supply,btohqsg
"Hi guys what does it mean by ""The coloured floor plan is not intended to demarcate the boundary of the flat"" in the floor plan given on the application page?",btohqsg
Wonder if bto results will be released this few days ‚Ä¶,btohqsg

Yes usually 2 weeks before appointment date,btohqsg
really need to revisit the import policy. i really wonder why the policy allow 5-6k/mth single above 35 pmets to get citizenship. thats like direct competition to locals. import 30-50k/mth managing directors or something la. tax also get more. or under 25 la if want them to come here to procreate/pro-family etc. what is going on sia.,btohqsg

out of supply by around 400+ for 4rm at Kallang... any chance?,btohqsg
Generally below 1.7x of supply got chance,btohqsg
No more chance. U all already knew that dropouts rate will be very low due to the 1st time giving up rate to 2nd timer,btohqsg
Just go apply for next BTO Launch,btohqsg
hard to say. with the new tightened penalties for non-selection  might not have chance,btohqsg

my Jun queue number is out of supply & hdb start the selection in Nov.Can I still apply for Oct launched if I was not called for unit selection?,btohqsg
Yes  since your q number is out of supply  you can apply for Oct launch,btohqsg
Pls note that if you are called for flat selection  you will have to choose from Juns,btohqsg
Cos if cannot and then Oct launch is closed n I was not called for unit selection  then very jialat.,btohqsg
So meaning I can submit bto application in Oxt  while waiting for Jun's to be called.Once called  Oct application is void.,btohqsg
Then if queue number exceed the number of flat by 200 ? Just wait or can just apply for next bto ?,btohqsg
As long as your q number is out of supply  you can apply for next launch. But once you are called for one launch  need to select else all others will be void & you'll become a 2nd timer,btohqsg
Ok  if this scenario:1st bto- queue number outside supply  waiting to be called;2nd bto - applied & given queue number within supply  waiting for appointment.IF  was called for 1st bto  can give up & wait for the appointment for 2nd bto?Or 2nd bto will also be void if did not make selection of unit when called for selection for  1st bto?,btohqsg
Whichever appt you get called for first  you must make a selection. Otherwise  penalty will occur.,btohqsg
But at least I know I can put up application for new bto while waiting for  my jun's outside supplyqueue to be called.,btohqsg
Can we reapply for HFE if it hasn't expired?,btohqsg

Wa marsiling peak5 room393 unitsFirst timer 0.6 - 235 applicantsTotal 406 applicantsYour queue number between 394 - 406? I think you can call hdb and ask why you out of supply.Could be due to the priority queue for the married couple and married child,btohqsg
U dunno the reasons? Anw shall not continue with such political discussions which isn't helpful,btohqsg
I see... didnt know issue queue will take both 1st and 2nd timer together  thanks for the info,btohqsg
For hdb's allocation of queue number  is there any ethnic quota taken into account?,btohqsg
@Peterlin_9musings about ethnic quota from SM,btohqsg
hello hello! for flat booking appts  will hdb assign us the date or do we get to choose? bc so far i see online it seemed to be assigned...? (but i may be wrong hence checking!),btohqsg
Hi! The selection date and time will be assigned based on queue number. You'll receive an appointment date usually 2 weeks ahead of the selection date,btohqsg
thank u! meaning the date is assigned by hdb right  is rescheduling allowed or no?,btohqsg
Recommended to go for the original date and time (at least 1 person) or authorise someone to go in your place as otherwise you'll lose your place in the queue,btohqsg
By which I mean you will select later than you would have  so others who should be behind you in queue number would go ahead of you,btohqsg
And specifically on rescheduling (vs walk in and waiting) I'm not too sure  would need to check with HDB on this,btohqsg
How long does the whole bto flat selection process take on average? 6 months for all units to be selected?,btohqsg
Been wanting to hear an answer to this too üòÇ,btohqsg
"It depends on number of units and speed of HDB (how many scheduled appointments each day) of course  but mine took about 2+ months (250ish units).This is anecdotal data  so strongly recommend to look at past data using@smchua's tracking  over at the BTO appointment date tracker channel. Search ""selection complete""https://t.me/btoapptdates",btohqsg
1 day around 8-10 Q numbers to be called   expect PH and Sunday. So u go counting this projects got how many units then u estimate.,btohqsg
At the start usually slower  could be only 1-2 per day even. After that yea will ramp up  could be 8-10 per day,btohqsg
Can even be 16-20 per day. I saw from Ulu Pandan Vistahttps://t.me/btoapptdates/188,btohqsg
From the tracker channel  i see usually about 2+ months for more units and about 1 month for fewer units,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing! Much clearer now.@berningbrightly&Kris Ohappreciate it!,btohqsg
Those with q number cannot apply next launch?,btohqsg
Cannot. If your Q is out of supply then can apply next launch,btohqsg
HDB now never let u game the system anymore with 2 Q numbers see u want give up which one .,btohqsg
Last time still can  but now no more  too many ppl game the system and many dropouts rate  then whose who wants to get a BTO urgently cannot get,btohqsg
My one withtin q number  but maybe only left lower level,btohqsg
Yours quite high queue number ?,btohqsg
So after receiving the Q number just wait for HDB‚Äôs notification for the selection appointment right?,btohqsg
Thank you. Just wanna make sure cause all the screenshots I saw has ‚ÄúPROCEED‚Äù button but ours don‚Äôt have üòÖ,btohqsg
Wonder  if there someone dropout do I have chance to select nice floor? üò©,btohqsg
wait till selection start and slowly monitor  good luck!,btohqsg
What's the total number of units?,btohqsg
I was almost at the end of supply and managed to get mid level floor (but further from MRT),btohqsg
So I think have to see what you prioritise. You can decide your priorities as the earlier selections happen,btohqsg
Can it be possible get mid level?,btohqsg
Need crystal ball to know xD,btohqsg
Have to see what the earlier selections like,btohqsg
That mean in front q numbers  a lot of them dropout?,btohqsg
It could also be what they choose,btohqsg
True also.. but most of them should be choose high floor right,btohqsg
One need crystal ball to knowü§£,btohqsg
Ok la on the bright side ur number is within supply üôè At least u get to choose something üôè,btohqsg
Depends on individual preference and budget... Last time a friend told me each higher floor bto unit cost $5k more...,btohqsg

OCTOBER then launch so u wait till OCTOBER,btohqsg
Ok did it mention the date?,btohqsg
Hi Mod  may I clarify if ur data point is before Aug 2023? Cos I understand that non-selection rules were tightened last year.. and my guess it that there are less people dropping out since new rules started after Aug 2023?Thanks!,btohqsg
Can I check why is it the applications not open yet they can know the number of applicants applying ?,btohqsg
Application only opens for a few days every few months  example is June 2024 BTO Exercise.,btohqsg
Its for the june BTO launch  October ones we wouldn‚Äôt know yet,btohqsg
As of 26 jun 2024  Hdb estimate around 20% may drop out,btohqsg
1.7 based on dec 2023 highest application rate sinming btoBut please note that Chinese quota run out at 1.16xIf you are non Chinese  below 1.7 still got chance,btohqsg
You can simply calculate or check it from the stats provided here,btohqsg
Yep my data point was before the new rules. So really may not apply,btohqsg
btw  just putting this information out there for anyone that might be wondering in the future.. this information regarding ethnic quota provided by MND is wrongi just gave HDB a call  the rep mentioned that within supply q numbers could possibly also run out of ethnic quota  because they have <not> taken it into account when generating q positions  even within the supply,btohqsg
U confused about the current BTO results and the next one is it ?Current ones already results out and of course can know the number of applicants applying,btohqsg
Bendon't confuse yourself. If u just want to apply for next launch is October. Once u apply October projects  then during the application u can also see daily the rate of application already.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs chances for 2 time owner,btohqsg
Aim for project with application rate below 1.Many second timer able to choose flat recently cause many projects not enough first timer,btohqsg
Some first timer application rate only 0.1 üòÇüòÇüòÇSecond timer no need luck also can get,btohqsg
But i heard even if 1st timer low application  2nd timer is still capped at the amount hdb set,btohqsg
This is not true.For project with first timer application rate below 1  HDB has confirmed they will invite second timer to select.Also  it is confirmed by checking the take up rate for those projects with AR 0.1 - 0.3.,btohqsg
U must be very lucky then can get. Some 1st Timer try for 10 times also cannot get,btohqsg
Thanks! Possible to pin this message admin?,btohqsg
Does it mean that if those earlier q number first timer drop out  the next q number can be 2nd timer?,btohqsg
For exampleTanglin halt 3R BTOApplication rate for first timer 0.2First timer applicants: ~ 30First + second timer applicants: 85Total flats: 155 unitsFlats selected: 70 unitsIn this case  all second timer will get the queue number within the supplySome second timer may get better queue number if he is luckyOnly advantage first timer over second timer is first timer has 2 chances of ballot,btohqsg
Does anyone has an idea  if supply is 100units  queue number 1-100 will comprise of 95 first timers and 5 2nd timers?,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the application rate for first timer?If application rate for first timer is above 1 then yea,btohqsg
If application rate for 1st timer is 2?,btohqsg
Then yea  it will be like this,btohqsg
So if application rate for 1st timer is less than 1  the queue 1 to 100 will be different composition?,btohqsg
YeaSecond timer will exceed 5% if not enough first timer,btohqsg
Sorry  only the owner can do it  and I'm not sure who the owner is,btohqsg
And what happens if/when you are within supply & you run out of ethnic quota?,btohqsg
So in essence  even if you are within supply  there's a possibility you may not have a chance? Damn.,btohqsg
yea which sucks becuse within supply is barred by the system from balloting for any upcoming projects  including oct one,btohqsg
But how legitimate is the information from the HDB rep?,btohqsg
only went to enquire because my q number is within supply but quite behind so there is a risk of running out of quota,btohqsg
Since there have been instances that different reps provide different responses.,btohqsg
yeap possible  but people have also  also heard of and reported such cases happening  albeit very very rare,btohqsg
The discussion here is that the MND information is inaccurate.,btohqsg
my prev ballot was within quota too and got called for booking appt. but 2 days bfre the day they cancelled bc exceeded quota limit for Malay ü•≤ü•≤ü•≤,btohqsg
Hi....when is the next BTO or SBF blasting?,btohqsg
ultimately it‚Äôs all user-reported and one rep‚Äôs answer  we can only take it at face value,btohqsg
Yup  but I would think the printed response from MND should be... accurate haha.Now there's apparently a possibility it's not lol.,btohqsg
If ur queue no. is behind behind  hdb can exercise  flexibility  and allow u to apply for next launch  there were some people from Oct 23 launch invited to apply for Dec 23 even though they were in supply,btohqsg
ahhh okay  i was not aware of this! thank you so much for your input  will give it a shot!,btohqsg
But is HDB email them one,btohqsg
If hdb never email  then maybe system will still block it,btohqsg
But this exceptional case should be raised to hdb and waiver should be sought.I believe during the ballotting process the ethnic quota parameters have been applied so shouldnt have such cases?,btohqsg
will be checking with hdb as per what lyn mentioned  if whether a waiver can be givenas to cases of such a thing happening.. either people are falsely reporting or.. mnd‚Äôs info is just not accurate i guess. since hdb reps are not 100% accurate either  only the person that coded the balloting system will truly know.. hahah,btohqsg
Yes Hdb‚Äôs programmer should hve considered such edge cases from the start ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Is your queue number towards the tail-end of the supply?,btohqsg
Fuuuk so bad ah they all lol,btohqsg
yea  at this point of time can only hope enough people of the same race drop outor hoping that whatever MND reported is true.,btohqsg
Yeah spam his TikTok comment section,btohqsg
Or let's get Leong Mun Wai to do it üòÇ,btohqsg
Hoping for a good outcome for you ü§ûüèæ,btohqsg
Hi! May I know bukit batok's oct bto floor plan?,btohqsg
Floor plan isn't released yet. Think now they release it some time after results are out. So definitely not before the application period,btohqsg
Ok thanks not sure the 2nd type of 2 room is it new design which have extra bedroom or not.,btohqsg
Before the application window  they will release the site plan  which should show what room types there are including which 2R version they will have,btohqsg
Example of another launch's site plan@Susan197709,btohqsg
No  it‚Äôs based on the overall ethnic population. The formula must ask HDB or MND liao,btohqsg
I don't think they will give an actual ans to that üòÇ,btohqsg
Fair question leh. You try ask üòÅ,btohqsg

Is buyer stamp duty also payable with cpf,btohqsg
do we need to pay HFE when we repply?,btohqsg
If I started working in Dec 2023  can I apply for HFE? I heard some people saying that we have to be working 12 or 14 months prior to HFE application.,btohqsg
12months normally. But can email HDB. Case by case basis,btohqsg
If want to apply for grant - need 12 months income documentsIf grant is not a concern and only looking at loan - person should be employed at the time of application AND when the loan is disbursed,btohqsg
"Adding on to my reply to@NurulAthirahFIncome documents required for grant is 12 monthsBut HFE has a cut off timeline of 2 months of which months of income documents to submitExample - if i apply for HFE this month  ie. August 2024  i should be submitting payslips from July 2023 to June 2024This is where the ""14 months"" comes into the pictureAssuming that i submitted (i) August 2023 - July 2024 payslips  (ii) September 2023 - August 2024 payslips or (iii) June 2023 - May 2024 payslips  HDB will probably contact me at some point and ask for the July 2023 (for i & ii) or June 2024 payslips (for iii)",btohqsg
Oh  so 12 mths income is for the grant. Thanks for explaining üôè,btohqsg
Only full time job will be taken into account right?,btohqsg
Anyone knows what is the reason they say u are not eligible for loan  grant and buying bto. But can use the hfe for resale?,btohqsg
Grants normally based on income limits  if u exceeding the different limits you wont be eligibleLoans based on the payslip that you submitted,btohqsg
Nope.. The weird thing is no changes to any income/documents with my expired hfe. But when i reapply and ask them expedite then they said im not eligible for any of loan  grant and even buy a bto. Can only use for resale,btohqsg
Hi good morning  may I ask.. for enhanced housing grant EHG  understand that have to be employed continuous for 12 months. Will it be one applicant or both applicant? I remember I read somewhere it is both applicant.,btohqsg
I think when you reapply HFE you might have choosed the option for resale only but not for new flats,btohqsg
Huh.. is there an option? I dont recall..,btohqsg
Yes there is option that states would you like to purchase BTO only or is considering BTO/resale,btohqsg
During the application to renew HFE,btohqsg
I just did it 2 days ago and rmb it is somewhere at the start of the application,btohqsg
Oh dear. But i wrote in to hdb for many times and even call asking why. They didnt give me an answer ü•≤,btohqsg
Because our net migration rate per cap of natural-born citizens can fight with actual at-war countries  and has for decades.,btohqsg
Not only that the large amount of scholarship  PR  citizenships and jobs are reserved for many foreign students. While quite a significant number consider Sg as a spring board or shortcut to their future or other countries.,btohqsg
Agree that shortage of public housing is due to the surge in numbers of new citizens.,btohqsg
Nowadays even when they import they import those rich and high income earners ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Can we use our own home country as springboard to other countries like USA or Aussie ?,btohqsg
Our G has created a fast track PR for as young as sec 1 kids. They will get all the scholarships (with no bonds). After going through NUS or even after JC/high school  they will not return & certainly not be new Sgs. Most of these kids will never get anything from their own countries. Worst of all  they mugged the systems n get their way into our elite schools. Just look at NUS high  HCI  RI etc.,btohqsg
Our kids are disadvantaged n resources have been limited. They should provide more for our children to build a better future.,btohqsg
All these immigration and respective policies are tied together. They not just import high rollers but the foreigners see many opportunities for them and their kids will be enticed to come. I will certainly welcome a country of such generosity if I m in an lower developed nation than Sg,btohqsg
BTOs are just one of tips of the giant iceberg,btohqsg
Depends on their results too . Last time I had China classmates who came in from sec 2   they topped the class in all subjects except English . Finally caught up in English after some years of struggling .I also had friends on scholarships who couldn‚Äôt maintain results and in the end lost their scholarship,btohqsg
We also have a number of locals who managed to get scholarships too ‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt attribute it entirely to foreigners ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
I understand but there are thousands and thousands every year. Just go to Sg Expo to see the AEIS exams and NUS high DSA entrance exams.,btohqsg
U just see NUS & NTU messy tours. U will no what I mean.,btohqsg
The problem is the control of numbers against our own. PRs are not Sgs,btohqsg
It‚Äôs the manipulation of the games in the rule books that‚Äôs worrying. It‚Äôs totally legit but somehow worrisome,btohqsg
Any better solutions to make up for decreasing work force? Not on anyone's side but knowing the issue without solutions or other alternatives  cannot resolve problems in longer terms.,btohqsg
I sincerely hope that there‚Äôs a solution. I strongly believe LKY‚Äôs valuing local talents and not over reliance on foreign labour (especially the PMETs).,btohqsg
We have the best education system in the world and highest in PISA scores. Dun burden our children with jobs  housing and even debts.,btohqsg
Apologies for raising these realities on the ground. Do hope we have a good future for our children.,btohqsg

Hi  any idea for the new BTO at Chencharu Link (Yishun)  how many units are there for 3rm?,btohqsg
I referred to the application rate found in SM chathttps://services2.hdb.gov.sg/webapp/BP13BTOENQWeb/AR_Jun2024_BTO?strSystem=BTO,btohqsg

Hello! Any gc or admins for keat hong verge?,btohqsg
Hi! Anyone managed to take a look at sengkang October 2024 BTO plot in person?Any idea if the plot(the one closer to layar lrt) has been covered or fenced up by HDB already?,btohqsg
Hi  you're from keat Hong verge right? Any group chat that@dadaism7can join?,btohqsg
Have! Lemme check with the admin,btohqsg
Meaning the HFE that is expired will still be used for the flat selection?,btohqsg
The one you used for SBF BTO resale applicationIt's ok for it to expired during your flat selection as application tire to itWhen near BTO SBF key collection HDB will inform you to create another HFE before key collection,btohqsg
thank u üôèüèª just got a unit there through SBF üòä,btohqsg
Is it possible to renew my HFE letter earlier? My expiry date ison 22 Octoberand I am aware that I can only renew it 30 days before expiry which will beon 22 September. However  HDB said to apply for HFEbefore 15 Septemberto apply for the October launch. I tried to cancel my HFE letter but it says that I cannot because I have used it for a flat application (Feb 2024 launch). However  the ballot number is so far from the flat supply and I am aware of the non-selection count and cancellation of other existing flat applications (including the upcoming Oct launch) if my number by miracle is due for selection. Hence why I do not really want to risk it. But I am also afraid if I waituntil 22 Septemberto renew my HFE letter  it will be too late for it to process just in time for the October launch.,btohqsg
The system will not allow earlier renew HFE  at least that's what we experienced. We were notified ard one month before expiry to apply renewal.,btohqsg
Called HDB on thisLooks like you can only apply for renewal when it available,btohqsg
Wanna check if there is any specific telegram group for kallang BTO june 2024? I got the results and would like to join the group discussion,btohqsg
Can I check if we can ballot for 1 specific project only? Or when we ballot it's for alllll the projects in the same town? Thank you!,btohqsg
All the projects in the same town if they have multiple,btohqsg
"Oh :o Okay  thank you :"")",btohqsg
Got it  appreciate the clarification :>,btohqsg
Don't need to cancel the old HFE. Just renew on 22 Sep will do.,btohqsg
Use myrequest on HDB portal to request for a change of earlier expiry  just done that,btohqsg
Is it possible to defer the sign of lease agreement to a later date?,btohqsg
Not key collection but sign of lease. Which is the 2nd appointment after flat selection,btohqsg
Ya can but must arrange with HDB on the date,btohqsg
When does mortgage payment start ?,btohqsg
Upon signing of lease or key collection?,btohqsg
I got my HFE Approved before the new enhanced CPF housing grant was increased. Am I able to cancel my existing one and re-apply? Since they say its only available to HFE approved after 20 Aug,btohqsg
HDB and MND said home buyers who have received an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter ‚Äì which indicates their eligibility to buy a flat and receive grants  as well as financing options ‚Äì will not need to apply for a new one. The letter will be updated to reflect the new EHG amount.,btohqsg

New grant amount table  from HDB's website,btohqsg
Singles still most discriminated ‚Ä¶ earning above 4.5k no grants Liao ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Is it better to apply under old loans limits/grantsor new loan limits/grants?,btohqsg
Any idea about the staggered payment,btohqsg
Good point. Grant is good for those with lower income. High income benefit from higher loan.,btohqsg
I got a friend who‚Äôs married to foreigner wife ‚Ä¶ his salary is slightly above the grant threshold of 4.5k and yet he can barely afford most 3rm resale flat based on his salary alone ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
For me new grants/loan better. Will benefit most people,btohqsg
No choice one . I also married foreigner wife. But i know i can't afford resale so we luckily have a child born after 1yr of marriage  then can apply BTO can get. After BTO get apply PR easier. My wife is a PR now..,btohqsg
Wife is foreigner . Income not considered under loan quantum,btohqsg
Mind if I ask which country ur wife is from ?,btohqsg
After Marriage  LTVP  LTVP+ then PR currently,btohqsg
Eh same as my friend‚Äôs wife . But income must be high enough to sponsor wife right ?,btohqsg
Mind if I pm u ?,btohqsg
No need laHave kids and have own houseProof to gov  your wife is gonna stay here for long term because have kids have house already ma,btohqsg
My incom also not Very High,btohqsg
As long as Foreigner wife/husband works and contribute to Singapore. Even better have kids here and house,btohqsg
PR will be very high chance to get,btohqsg
If have sg child can apply bto,btohqsg
Yes SG child apply BTO with u is 2 SC component.But loan amount is Only on you not with your spouse ha.Grant is on u both means grant will he lower Because they see both income de for grant,btohqsg
I see . His wife planning to go back her country in next few years .,btohqsg
Hdb sometimes funny. Grant see both income. Loan only see one üòÖüòÇ,btohqsg
Ya they scared ma u not PR here how to give u more loan not fair to others,btohqsg
Huh foreign spouse also can get grant meh ? I tot both loan and grants only see the Singaporean spouse income ?,btohqsg
Loan is see Singaporen/PR income Only,btohqsg
Grants is Not.Grants see both spouse income to give,btohqsg
So Grants will be lower because is 2 x income.Loan will be also lower because only sees one Singaporean applicant income,btohqsg
So follow which table ? Grant table for first timer households ?He was telling me he can only get singles grant which is $0 lol,btohqsg
For grant they see both income. For loan only 1 person income üòÖ. So for example u together have income of 10k. Then not eligible for grant..but loan only see the sc income. So get lower loan,btohqsg
Your SC baby/kids will be an essisenal occupier means must fulfill MOP,btohqsg
Ok thanks for the clarification guys !,btohqsg
As long as the wife is working  her income would be included,btohqsg
Yes but first still must be eligible to apply BTO/SBF la. 1 SC + 1 Non SC/PR cannot apply BTO unless have SC childAlso 1 SC + 1PR also have 1 x levy of 10KAfter PR get SC or have a SC child this $10K will be return to u,btohqsg
Thanks for clarification. If he applies with his foreign spouse 2rm bto after 35  both their income considered for grants right ?,btohqsg
Both their income for grant yes.Loan only based on SC/PR applicant only,btohqsg
Wa 35 apply 2rm flexi. How long more ? If really married already apply PR get bigger house better,btohqsg
I got friend who is single and regret to get 2rm flexi  should have go apply for 3rm resale,btohqsg
Ya next time 2rm flexi MOP sell also flip,btohqsg
2room flexi bto is better than 3 room resale imho. At least after mop u can sell and get good profit then upgrade to bigger flat. The resale value of a 2room bto is very high,btohqsg
My friends got into a dilemma situation:They got a balloted queue number within flat supply for the june bto; then previous balloted number which exceeded the flat supply invited them to flat selection.Will there be penalty if they reject the invitation? They prefer the latest balloted number within flat supply..Anyone had similar experiences before?,btohqsg
Need to be save by the ethnic quota or less than 10 unit in this case. If not got non selection penalty,btohqsg
Is there ways to check how many units left for certain bto supply?,btohqsg
Yea u r right . Those old 3 rm flats in amk selling for like 400k+,btohqsg
Really ? I tot 2 rm flexi not popular,btohqsg
He‚Äôs got 2 more yrs . I told him if wanna bto   can only do so for 2 rm and need to wait for successful ballot . Why not just get resale straightaway?,btohqsg

Yes PR is considered for the loan. But overall have a $10K levy if no SC child,btohqsg
If have SC child already this $10k will be return,btohqsg
For Plus/Prime  it will be included in the unit pricing already. They don‚Äôt usually tell you how much subsidies they‚Äôll give on the unit pricing but they will tell you how much they are going to clawback if you sell,btohqsg

Hi Guys i need some advice. I just got my HFE approved last week. My partner and i was granted $80k EHG grant for resale flats. But today the news came out as EHG grants up to $120k. Is it possible for me to cancel this HFE letter and re-apply for another HFE in hopes to get the $120k ehg grant?,btohqsg
For those who have an HDB Flat Eligibility (HFE) letter but have yet to apply for a flat in a sales exercise  HDB will update their HFE letter via the HDB Flat Portal to reflect the revised EHG amount and will notify them individually by email[3]. Applicants do not need to re-submit their HFE applications.Source:https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/measures-to-cool-the-hdb-resale-market-and-provide-more-support-for-first-time-home-buyers#:~:text=The%20EHG%20will%20be%20increased amount%20of%20%2440%2C000%20to%20%2460%2C000.,btohqsg

Hi guys  if you're able to choose between others / Chinese as a race for bto appliction... which will u choose? the location you're balloting is dominated by Chinese. I'm quite torn as I am worried if I choose others as race  it's hard for me to sell. Anyone can share their experience?,btohqsg
anyone know when kim keat will receive the key for housing ?,btohqsg
Hello! Can I check if anyone applied under MCPS (already chosen a unit) and parents are divorced. Can you pm me please! I have things to ask,btohqsg
i would say consider how much you want to get the unit there.. because if you think choosing Chinese will reduce your chances to potentially not even getting a unit vs having the chance of it being hard to sell  see which consequence more painful to you. FYI choosing others doesn't mean you wont be able to sell to Chinese/Malay - it depends on the EIP restrictions in that estate and block.,btohqsg
Hello Jason  just to check  each individual block EIP Quota is different and updated monthly?,btohqsg
yup  got EIP for block and neighbourhood. Updated monthly,btohqsg
I‚Äôll choose others because it is discounted as well if I‚Äôm not wrong as I don‚Äôt intend to sell. If u are planning to sell in the future in a prime location  purchase higher price as Chinese. As there are a lot more buyers. I have done a lot of resale hunting and most of the units that can‚Äôt sell that many want to buy is non Chinese sellers.,btohqsg
Also Chinese quota in prime area is definitely harder to get a house  u don‚Äôt get many non Chinese in places like holland V and Bukit Timah,btohqsg
So apply as non Chinese in prime area if u don‚Äôt intend to sell. If u intend to sell  apply as Chinese,btohqsg
This is the trend from past to now. In the future things might be different  maybe non Chinese would want to move to prime and expensive estate. But now  it is just how it is objectively.My friend (Chinese) married a Malay and they got their SFB applied as non Chinese at a prime area. This should explain what u should try to apply as haha,btohqsg
For my friend's case with his foreign spouse  the cpf housing grant for resale flat  will he be considered under singles or family?,btohqsg

not much diff for mid to higher income,btohqsg
Choose Chinese if canIf can‚Äôt choose Chinese then choose othersDon‚Äôt worry when you sell  you can appeal to HDB to sell under ChineseFrom my agent friend so far all appeal successfully as your case is others+chineseBut need sell within the 1-3 months timeline.,btohqsg

Q number exceed supply by how much please,btohqsg
Rail Garden  exceed by more than 10,btohqsg
Yes  if there's less than 10 units left  HDB can waive the non selection penalty,btohqsg
Do contact HDB to confirm and the processes for it,btohqsg
Yes. If less than 10 can ask hdb to waive u from selection.,btohqsg
If no more etnic quota they will message u again and tell u no need to come,btohqsg
Hi  can I check if I will be able to see the floor plan before the appointment to select the flat?,btohqsg
Yes  definitely floor plan will be released before starting selection,btohqsg
Thank u. Can I check if it will be tied to the unit number?,btohqsg
Ok. Thanks for the info. Can I also check if the brochure will be send via email? Or I will need to search online to download?,btohqsg
Can follow bto Appointment Tracker channel  and your own group chat  usually ppl will post,btohqsg

Anyone applied for HFE after 20 August and received their approved HFE?,btohqsg
Hi..Does anyone here know about Havelock hillside?,btohqsg
Only applicable for resale unitIf u already apply for BTO  u will already know what u want the 3/4rmSo when it happens on selection u only can either choose low floor of this block or high floor for another block if is still available,btohqsg
Hi guys anyone received their approved HFE earlier before? Understand that it takes about a month,btohqsg
Mine was approved in 2 weeks,btohqsg
does the 10 units left to reject project include ethnic quota?,btohqsg
Can elaborate on your question by giving example?,btohqsg
now left 20 units eg 3rm. malay quota 9. indian 1 chinese 10.  if i malay 1st timer and i reject to book a unit. will i be considered second timer next round or still first timer?,btohqsg
Will be considered as 2nd timer for 1 year,btohqsg
that function reports to telegram moderators. not chat moderators,btohqsg
This means you need to upload the documents before the date given. Once you clicked you will see what are the documents needed by hdb.,btohqsg
"I had this during my 1st HFE. Only received sms to check status n when you login  you see this ""upload documents""  you need to upload before the given date  n make sure you have upload all documents you want before you click submit. Once submitted  you can't upload anymore. If you realised you forgotten to upload the documents required  hdb would not process. Then 2 weeks later you will receive another sns to ask you check status  a tally is to ask you to upload another documents which actually you forgotten to upload earlier.",btohqsg
Yes  you can go in here also.,btohqsg
So for my HFE that I renewed (Expire on 11 Sep)  I submitted all doc in 1 shot  n I got my HFE approved within a week.,btohqsg
Mine totally no SMS or email,btohqsg
Same for 1st HFE  time wascwasted on the submission of doc which i didnt do n didnt submit all requested  after I submitted all docs  HFE was approved within a week too..So you need to submit..,btohqsg
Ok  i suggest you just go in to see what docs you need to submit n to upload.,btohqsg
Thank you! Now then they start asking hahah,btohqsg
is chencharu hills brochure out yet?,btohqsg
Cos since 18 August always stuck at this page,btohqsg
I see. Better quickly upload all needed in 1 shot otherwise wait n wait is another sms ask you to upload instead of approval.Becos last time after I submitted I realised I didn't submit 1 of the doc  then waited another 2 weeks  cos no more button for me to click upload. So wsitef 2 weeks again then I could upload.,btohqsg
seems like chenharu hills like no updates for brochure and stuff,btohqsg
Mine was approved in about 2-3 working days  I think v subjective ü•∂,btohqsg
How is hfe loan amount calculated ?,btohqsg
By you and ur spouse income,btohqsg
hfe application  education level  can i put my ongoing uni? or must be completed certification?,btohqsg
should be highest level obtained. ongoing uni not counted,btohqsg
Can i ask  if hdb invite u to go down and select flat  but by your turn not much left,btohqsg
See u can ask for waiver,btohqsg
If it's less than 10 units  you can get a waiver of non selection penalty,btohqsg
If more than 10 unit normally drop out then consider 2nd timer for a year?,btohqsg
The final say still hdb ba,btohqsg
Like what Housing Bot said  you can write in to HDB to clarify  but they have laid out 10 units as their criteria  so will need to see what they say,btohqsg
All the best to your bto journey.,btohqsg
Imho if invited for flat selection  if u cant waive it  i would encourage u to just select a unit. Its not worth to be 2nd timer for a year unless ur going for a resale flat instead of bto. 2nd timer is hard to get a number.,btohqsg
Later after 5 years mop can always sell and buy another flat that u like,btohqsg
If plus or prime not so easy to sell.,btohqsg
I heard if want to sell the buyer who bought as resale also need 10yrs Mop,btohqsg
Email hdb cuz i apply for next bto previously when my q out of supply,btohqsg
Today my friend also same problem.1. She applied Bedok BTO on Feb2024 and got Q number which is exceed 2002. Then she go for tanjong rhu BTO June 2024 and got Q number 1xxx within 2xxx.But now she received email from HDB go for selection of the bedok BTO and it has 200units leftover.But she doesn‚Äôt keen it anymore she want tanjong rhu de. Could she ignore the call for bedok selection? And it could become 2nd timer or not,btohqsg
her queue number exceeded the number of units by 200? and it still has 200 units leftover now when it's reaching her?,btohqsg
Sorry i get confused.The correct is her Q exceed the number of people by 200. And now is her turn and already received email by HDB for selectio.,btohqsg
How about She still in the queue for tanjong rhu oh.,btohqsg
Cannot  her June application will be CANCELLED,btohqsg
Unless less than 10units balance for Feb BTO then appeal,btohqsg
All your ongoing flat application will be cancelled,btohqsg
Anyone knows Whats the last appointment timing for the day?,btohqsg
It depends on each project but usually after 8pm should be safe,btohqsg
Can i ask  this thing press proceed alr  still at pending? Is it no need to care one  just bring document down on the day,btohqsg
Yup after selection they will move on to next step,btohqsg
Hi guys can I ask if one of the applicant is a student and another applicant is a working party (been working for more than a year)  are we still eligible for the deferred income assessment,btohqsg
No need to click priceed  this one is to proceed to get a new hfe  so now you are gicen a date n time to book unit even if your hfe expired on booking day  you dont need to click proceed to apply new hfe. Just bring doc down.,btohqsg
by technicality  not eligible because both has to be studying or worked less than 12 months. however  you can try to appeal for DIA,btohqsg
Good morning  does anyone knows when is the SBF?is this after the completion of the unit selections of tge pasts launched or until the project is TOP?If it is after the completion of the unit selections of the launched  eg. June's bto  estimate when will be the SBF?Thanks.,btohqsg
Feb 2025  I also curious whether flat left from June 2024 will be featured.,btohqsg
SBF occurs once a year in February.The list of flats come from unsold units in the BTO exercise as well as drop outs from people who have selected the BTO or forfeiture.While the timeline from BTO to SBF launch is not disclosed  mine was roughly 2 years from BTO to SBF.,btohqsg
Not instantaneously from leftover after flat booking?,btohqsg
Nope not instantaneously listed. Seems like they will group and pool a large number before releasing to SBF.,btohqsg
But eg  yours' was 2yrs from bto? This is long.Thought hdb gather Feb  Jun's bto to have SBF in Feb of the year.,btohqsg
Ya mine was 2 years and mine is a single stack.,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think HDB will push out flats to SBF until all BTO queue holders have selected or dropped.. which usually only starts selection a few months after BTO results out. So 1.5-2 years sounds reasonable,btohqsg
First part yes  second part not necessarily as they can just push those few flats to the next SBF launchAnyways SBF is a much tougher fight than BTO,btohqsg
Yeah.. high demand low supply. Especially for people who don‚Äôt want to wait 3-5 years for their flats will want to fight for SBF,btohqsg
Hi is there any email/hotline which I can reach out to contact them?,btohqsg
HDB number is 1800-866-3066Follow the IVRhttps://www.hdb.gov.sg/-/media/HDBContent/Images/SCEG/eapg-ivr.ashxalternatively you can submit an e-feedback found on their website,btohqsg
Apparently I tried calling them and they mentioned that the HFE/housing loan will not be reassessed after I told them my case,btohqsg
write in again and reword your justification. if all else fails  ask your MP to help üôÇ,btohqsg
need to redo hfe if its expiring next month but got number for june bto? if want to apply oct bto and reapply for hfe will it affect the june bto application?,btohqsg
Nope for HFE letter however June BTO is based on your existing HFE. Maybe you want to elaborate whether if you are within supply for June 2024?,btohqsg
If you have already used the HFE letter to apply for a flat in our earlier sales exercises  these flat applications will not be affected.,btohqsg
Can we change from hdb loan to bank loan after signing the lease agreement?,btohqsg
so can just reapply again la? out of supply but got number given. if no number i wouldnt bother just reapply liao. but in order to reapply need to cancel the old one?,btohqsg
Hello! I have a question :) If we applied for HFE letter for BTO (iirc  there's a field where you've to state what this letter is for: BTO/Resale?)...Can we use the same letter for resale application or do we have to get a new letter? Thank you.,btohqsg
Thank you for the clarification :),btohqsg
Hi may I know if I get the Q number and wait for November to select the unit  does it affect the loan amount if i change a new car now?,btohqsg
U Change new car got affect loan one meh,btohqsg
U got ur HFE already  so should not affect...,btohqsg
How  come Canberra   Vista blk376C  next years  February  ready  collection  key?,btohqsg
What keyboard can lets you auto double spacing? Thanks sharing.,btohqsg
HDB loans are subjected to MSR  not TDSR I suppose.If he/she is taking a housing loan from a financial institution  then yes  TDSR will be considered.,btohqsg
Actually I‚Äôm curious  what‚Äôs the average dropout rate for bto ? 20%-30%?,btohqsg
Tanglin halt courtyard dropout rate is quite high,btohqsg
So many reason why ppl dropout.,btohqsg
Unless u interview everyone get their answer,btohqsg
I thought many have prepared before applying for this bto,btohqsg
There are people who still missed out certain steps.,btohqsg
May I know what is the drop out rate for Tanglin Halt courtyard?,btohqsg
Is it possible hdb officer will suggest people to dropout if financial capabilities is insufficient? Like too high over the budget? Or will they accept regardless?,btohqsg
My friend dropout before cannot Use HDB loan  not enough CPF. During selection  HDB officer tells them to use bank loan  they can't afford to loan and reject the selection. Dropout,btohqsg
So far around 20 out of 111 (111 is last queue for today)..,btohqsg
Why cannot use hdb loan? Cos use up 2x chances?,btohqsg
I guess they wont suggest but just inform about the amount of cash topup,btohqsg
Maybe ur friend think if cant pay downpayment later better to dropout early on coz later waste money if cant afford?,btohqsg
I am speculating holland V dropout might be higher than tanglin halt given the higher prices,btohqsg
Salary Not enough to justify to loan from HDB. So hdb suggest go for bank loan see how much bank can loan then reminding pay cash . They also cannot afford. No choice dropout.Financial Difficulties still die die go for 4rm unit. Aiya what to do never listen never go plan,btohqsg
Did they know this beforehand during their hfe ?,btohqsg
Are they fresh grads ? Or self employed?,btohqsg
For those non mature estates drop out rates lower ?,btohqsg
Some people are very young to plan carefully. Die2 they think bigger rooms and central location is best,btohqsg
Like 21 years old after ns/study but then they go buy 5 room at queentowns. Then pick highest floor,btohqsg
Cpf and loan for sure not enough. Best to be prudence,btohqsg
Maybe.. not sure.. what u applied?,btohqsg
Queue within or out of supply? Chencharu is quite affordable and popular amongst the non matured estates,btohqsg
It‚Äôs within supply   I applied 4 rm flat it‚Äôs within my budget range ;),btohqsg
Chencharu is a bargain. Starts at 279k for 4 room. I think this is similar to 2020 pricing,btohqsg
Congrats for those who gets a que for it,btohqsg
Thanks for all ur well wishes ! But not much amenities except market in Khatib ?,btohqsg
Seems like there will be future amenities,btohqsg
They know but still want to try la. Not fresh grad but working as freelancer,btohqsg
Not sure leh i not freelancer haha,btohqsg
IMHO  and just my 5cents thought:a freelancer do not have a steady income  how to buy a unit when not enough cash  cof n I don't think bank wants to offer loan.,btohqsg
Freelancer I'm not sure how hdb assess their income...,btohqsg
Just my humble opinion:There are so many jobs in the market  may be your freelancer friend can take up a regular job  then pursue his passion as a freelancer during off time unless he is in his 50s  or have enough savings in his bank account.Passion cannot put food on table especially if getting married   so need to be realistic in this hungry world.,btohqsg
Actually some freelancer i know makes lots of money. Just that its difficult for hdb to assess the income,btohqsg
You may be right but I guess this apply to experienced freelancers.Also when there is no doc of the proved of income  it is difficult for hdb n banks  just like if there is no proper education certificate n want to teach or do something  1st thing to see is the paper - proof of education.,btohqsg
I am a freelancer too..unless you can provide HDB with some form of invoice or monthly contribution into your bank account or statement as well as cpf  then HDB will only allow or grant you HFE.However  you may not be eligible for any HDB loan.,btohqsg
Also  bank..therefore..you may need to pay cash & cpf for your new BTO.,btohqsg
Yes  exactly - a monthly contribution/statement is needed. I agree with you.,btohqsg
Yes . Freelancer do find friends that have company to IN CPF for them but they will pay on their own pocket via cash back just to have cpf contribution,btohqsg
To add on: banks these days are very straight. I went to one of the bank to invest a product with cash. So need to open an account in order to do an investment  it took 1hour for the bank officer to do a background check on me by inputting all needed data.  So imaging it is not a loan from bank  I'm putting $$ into the bank.. so to get a loan I guess is even more difficult if there is no monthly paycheck..,btohqsg
Do u get grants as freelancer if i may ask?,btohqsg
One can top up own cpf  right? Don't need to go thru 3rd party.,btohqsg
Freelancers are the same as self employed right?,btohqsg
U guys heard ofphaxxx workers? üòÇ,btohqsg
No grants...anyway  I'm a second-timer...Even though I didn't take any cpf grants before but my first SBF is considered already subsidised by HDB...so no more...in fact my pay levy.,btohqsg
Not really...because its not a fix thing..like if u lucky u get the job..we don't have like own company or agent representing us...what more the amount we get for any gig varies,btohqsg
Ya  guess only if you own a company  then it is classified as 'self-employed'.,btohqsg
Or those phv drivers or food delivery riders are self employed?,btohqsg
I think they have prove of their daily earnings  like grab they have weekly statement,btohqsg
Also they are encouraged to contribute to their cpf yearly at least a min amount..,btohqsg
Maybe if they can prove consistent earnings at least 12 maths Maybe HDB grant loan?Guess best ask them,btohqsg
Hi everyone  I am trying to renew my HFE letter as it expires on the 27th October. Would like to seek advice on the following:1. Do i have to renew my HFE for the upcoming launch in October?2. If i wish to renew my HFE  how can i do so? I have navigated throughout the hdb website (It leads me around in a circle: Cancel HFE -> Submit request with HDB -> Mention HFE has been used with a flat application -> Cancel HFE)Appreciate any advice on this. Thank you !,btohqsg
You only can re-apply on 28th Sept. 1 month before your HFE expire.,btohqsg
Ah i see  thank you Victor ! Much appreciated,btohqsg
Ask for an early expiry  I did that,btohqsg
Maybe the checks were to ensure that the bank account will not be used for money laundering?,btohqsg
In case this will be useful for anyone,btohqsg
I chanced upon a mutual friend posting on her ig. Perhaps this might be useful for you..,btohqsg
Best to cancel/renew the old hfe. If not grant and loan amount will be attach to the old hfe which u used for the initial application,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt need to cancel. Can write in to renew it.,btohqsg
Just like I said  ask for an earlier expiry for that HFE,btohqsg
Ya true. Better to write in to renew early,btohqsg
I‚Äôm trying to apply hfe  anyone see this error msg before? What does it mean? I emailed hdb le but still waiting reply,btohqsg
What scheme are u applying under ?,btohqsg
Hi   yishun beacon have tele grp?,btohqsg
What did u input into hfe ?,btohqsg
Anyone knows what HDB would ask for during unit selection if one is a self employed?,btohqsg
Do u just need to have your singpass?,btohqsg
Both u and ur spouse employed for past 12 months? Or at least 1 employed for the past 12 months?,btohqsg
U tried to reapply for hfe but still cannot?,btohqsg
Have u tried clearing ur browser cache or signing up on different browsers ?,btohqsg
No eh. But I did try on husband phone using his account  also same error msg üòÇ,btohqsg
U try clear cache or use another browser . Sometimes Hdb hfe portal abit weird . Last time I encountered a lot of issues when signing up too,btohqsg
Think u try calling Hdb hotline and seek help from there,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt even clear first step üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
I saw this table. Like don‚Äôt have my query leh. Am I 1-1?,btohqsg
Maybe wait for the last option to speak to a officer,btohqsg
Then they will direct u accordingly,btohqsg
HurhurüòÖ I found out why le. Cos I staying with my parents and used PHGü§™ PHG can ‚Äúreverse‚Äù anot? Means I payback the $30k grant.. I thought can üòÖ,btohqsg
After reading up  housing grant don‚Äôt need return to gov one leh. Does this mean if one day they sell this house I should be entitled to ($30k/total buying price) of the selling price? ü§≠ theoretically,btohqsg
Yes it goes back to your OA.,btohqsg
My OA? Or my parents‚Äô OA?,btohqsg
Opps their OA if they sell,btohqsg
Ur flat is within PHG distance right? What u chose? The 30k grant for staying with ur parents? R u buying bto or resale?,btohqsg
Grant incurs accured interest as its in cpf OA. So after selling need to refunded the accured interest generated by the grant.,btohqsg
Brother! its credited to our bank acc! no need to set up fake links to steal our teleg acc one!,btohqsg
The scammer will take over your telegram,btohqsg
Hi all  we just got invited to select a flat for bedok but our number is very far behind. Can I check how the non selection waiver works? Does it have to be strictly less than 10 units?,btohqsg
Our appointment is 2 weeks later  do we have to make the appeal before the appointment or after? :) thanks for the response btw!,btohqsg
The block that we are looking at only has approx 10 units left ~,btohqsg
Let‚Äôs say if ethic quota is taken up  the appointment will be automatically cancelled and we don‚Äôt have to do anything right?,btohqsg
Just quite worried because we are aiming for the next launch and definitely don‚Äôt want to be categorised as second timers due to this,btohqsg
Ah ok I‚Äôll write in first then!,btohqsg
Hello  anyone has recommendation for ID?,btohqsg
will recommend contractors more if u alr hv design theme in mind  can skip middleman fees,btohqsg
can check out@brighthouse.sg  had a good reno experience with them and they are reliable with physical showroom at tampines,btohqsg
Just wanted to check if anyone has managed to appeal successfully for non selection waiver with more than 10 units?,btohqsg
have. their successful appeal is cos ethnic quota is <10 even though available units is >10,btohqsg
Ahhh what about cases with just slightly above ethnic quota,btohqsg
Right now we aren‚Äôt sure because our appointment is in 2 weeks and the block we were eyeing for ethnic quota is <10,btohqsg
But the other project is >10,btohqsg
There are 2 projects for the Bedok launch and one has less than 10 for ethnic quota haha,btohqsg
The other has more than 10,btohqsg
So not sure why calculated as 2 different quotas üòÖ,btohqsg
ethnic allocation is calculated per block. available units is based on the project/projects if there‚Äôs more than 1 project in the same estate for that launch,btohqsg
Hi genuine question here. Is there anyway to check whether its indian or chinese temple being built near bto site?,btohqsg
can check URA planning map. the map will indicate if the plot is used for religious purposes or not. but it will not mention what religion,btohqsg
The BTO map will state. example upcoming Sengkang bto site,btohqsg
Ok thanks. Ur a genius üòä,btohqsg
Hi all.. does anyone know  if we cancel our HFE letter  when will be the earliest we can apply for a new HFE letter? Will the new application be affected?Cuz both of us are commission based and the current HFE letter shows we are not eligible to buy BTO cuz our income exceeded $14k.. but actually in average it doesn‚Äôt exceed ü•≤Any suggestions?,btohqsg
write in via efeedback regarding your info and call to expedite :),btohqsg
Hi all  may i know for setting up a new account for electricity and water utilities with PUB is it already done for us before bto key collection or we have to manually apply with PUB before key collection. Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
What about 2.8? Isit possible for BTO?,btohqsg
May I know which provider electricity gives the best package?,btohqsg
Yes . Those bto in Canberra is 2.8,btohqsg
Write in via e-feedback form to request for cancellation. Once cancelled  you can apply for HFE letter.,btohqsg
Okieeee.. Thx Desmond~ We‚Äôve managed to call in‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
For my own experience  hdb cancelled my HFE letter within the day I wrote in.,btohqsg
For once I thought u are the housing minister üòÇ,btohqsg
Yes  same name and surname. But I am not just monitoring this chat only. Haha,btohqsg
Are u also monitoring resale Hdb prices ? üòÇ,btohqsg
If he is he should know that many ppl are unhappy with the unaffordable resale hdb prices.,btohqsg
How about posting it here asking if there‚Äôs anyone single that wants to BTO together üòÇ,btohqsg
I think this is not right.What if both parties agree  that they just for 'bto' purpose  then after getting the unit  only 1 to stay  both agree that  5yrs later to sell & to split the proceed.,btohqsg
U have to trust your partner a lot to do this. If he remarries someone that‚Äôs first timer. He can flip again and the wife will get stuck. So think again.,btohqsg
So mop 5yrs is a bit short. If longer like 10yrs for all and 15yrs for PLH & premier types  may be can curb this to happen..just my 5cents thought.,btohqsg
From the day of divorce and the flat belongs to a party  the devise can start  he doesn‚Äôt have to wait for the MOP or the divorce wife to get a BTO.,btohqsg

if no changes to your sallary then same,btohqsg
Hi all just wanted to check given the new HDB measures  is it still possible to take maximum loan under HFE (msr of 30%),btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone knows if there is any group created for upcoming Kallang/Bayshore? üôè,btohqsg
Sometimes the automatic email come after the submission.. you ca try to log in and see whether there‚Äôs any more field for you to upload documents.. if there‚Äôs nothing for you to upload then should be fine.. if you are still not sure  can just call in to the hotline to check~,btohqsg

"Why the ""bayshireoct2024bto"" got dirty adv from Chil? I saw the adv but dare not click join the bto group.",btohqsg
I mean here has spam too üòÇ all groups need to rely on people to report to admins and admins to delete,btohqsg
Those are bots with inappropriate links  never ending one. I deleted that Chii dunno how many times already haha.So don‚Äôt be scared as long as you don‚Äôt click on it. Example like phishing email or sms. You go any bto group also will see all this one not just Bayshore. Just when it will happen only.,btohqsg
"Hi üëã   just wonder have anyone got the ""bedok blossoms"" bto project block number plan or map?

Hi! Can I check for Oct launch  will the downpayment thing be revised to the new one?,btohqsg
The public group has already been closed. Unless you join the residents group which is a private group,btohqsg
How do i join the private group?,btohqsg
Hi all  please beware of this group  the anon admin (NOT a resident) is wreaking havoc to the project‚Äôs community and slandering  banning and insulting residents in there.https://t.me/TanglinHaltCourtyardY‚Äôall can judge for yourselves üëçüèª.,btohqsg
Coming from an admin  it‚Äôs so low.,btohqsg
It's important to keep groups verified resident-only,btohqsg
Guys  if like that case  I just no need to attend the flat application will do?The appointment is tomorrow 2pm üòÖ,btohqsg
i‚Äôd suggest you write to HDB to confirm your waiver of non selection as there‚Äôs < 10 units to choose from,btohqsg
U must go. Then ask them to waive,btohqsg
Invited must go down..Then if u not gonna select a unit  request to officer to waive.If u never go  they will cancelled your con current application,btohqsg
Wait for reply takes days .,btohqsg
If u have another ongoing Q number for another project  I'll tell u just go to the appt.If not they cancelled your ongoing application,btohqsg
Haha but they reject reply very fast  told them I only have 8 choices out of the  13 units. They say only can decide when it‚Äôs my turn to choose,btohqsg
"Just to ask  so must put ""watch list units"" then can see the  number of remaining units?",btohqsg
No need  click the watchlist button that is red colour to view,btohqsg
Still have another ongoing application which is Tanjong Rhu Project‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
Very thankful for your info! It‚Äôs really help.,btohqsg
Hii  how do I navigate to this watchlist units?,btohqsg
Btw there‚Äôs a new public group for THC. The owner deleted the 300 members one after make a din.https://t.me/THCResidentsOfficial,btohqsg
Idk üòÇ actually i asking on my friend behalf üòÇ,btohqsg
Do you think SBF in feb 25 will include Tg Rhu? (I missed the submission when I was in overseas in feb)Is SBF slughtly more expensive then BTO price?,btohqsg
Yes sbf will be more expensive than the BTO when it LaunchIf 2017 BTO still got balance flat how can compared to current pricing,btohqsg
Tg Thu bto won‚Äôt be in Feb 25 sbfAs it‚Äôs still the selection period,btohqsg
Ah ya  my mistakes  feb is for another project  didnt submit for Tg Rhu was becos my partner prefer HV  but I personally like Tg Rhu  n don't mind HV.,btohqsg
Ok. Reason I ask is becos I might not get HV since is outside supply  so thought I could then submit SBF for Tg Rhu.Ok never mind  1 step at a time. Thanks all for all the info.,btohqsg
Haven‚Äôt started selection yetUsually selection last more than 6 monthsYou can wait for 2026 SBF but no guarantee have any leftover unit also,btohqsg
How much out of supply are u? Holland V might have high dropout as the price more expensive than THC,btohqsg
How about ethnic quota? If ethnic quota full no need to go down,btohqsg
We wish to clarify that the waiver of the non-selection count is based on the units left available when your turn is due  not based on ethnic quota.Not sure why,btohqsg
Housing & Development Board---February 2024 Build-To-Order (BTO) Exercise: Sorry  all 4-Room in Queenstown for Chinese sold. No need to attend appointment on 12 September 2024. Read our email/letter on what's next.---This is an automated message sent by the Singapore Government.,btohqsg
Got this message when ethnic quota is full so can skip thurs appointment,btohqsg
They sent it within few hours,btohqsg
So might be helpful to check ethnic quota,btohqsg
Even when theres only 8 units level people wack level 4 for thc and took the last chinese slot,btohqsg
So got 2 blocks? Looks like total chinese quota is 4,btohqsg
