Vividthree - Bottom Picking- currently (Opened $0.041 as of 20th Nov 2020).Background- looks to have found bottomed at $0.035 to $0.040- Most of the liquidity level at $0.07 & $0.08- On Sept 30  Vividthree Holdings chairman and independent director Ho Choon Hou (non residence ambassador to United Mexican States  Co-founder of Cordlife  principal at Southern Capital Group Pte Ltd  a private equity firm   acquired 11 090 400 shares of the Catalist-listed company for a consideration of S$776 328 at $0.070 per share and took his total interest in Vividthree Holdings to 3.32 per cent.- Ron Sim invested $2million at $0.215- IPO in 2018 was at $0.25 per share- the last time it bottomed at current downtrend channel  it went back up to $0.080 pretty quick. Recently  it touched the downtrend channel again and the set up is similar to the last time.- they announced placement  $2 million at $0.126 earlier Feb2020 but SGX  blocked as they still had money from IPO. But now they might have used up most and I believe they will fry back to $0.07 to $0.09 range (same level where they did big amount of married deals) and retry to do another placement perhaps $0.07 to $0.08 to raise funds for their ongoing collaborations/ventures.- Selling pressure is very minimal at current prices as most of the investors are stuck at IPO prices ($0.25) or earlier investors at $0.15 to $0.20.- Business scope includes Virtual Reality  Content Creation  Gaming Events  VR events like Train to Busan at RWSWhy Buy?- Bottomed out and we are buying cheaper than Dr Hou at $0.070- They tried to raise capital by doing placement at price of at least $0.126 but SGX blocked. Hence  they will likely fry up prices to do a placement close to $0.080 IMO- Several announcements of new collaborations with Resurgence (gaming)  NTUC-related subsidiairy etc. shows management adapting to recent covid19 circumstance. Should be expecting more catalyst in time to comeTarget Price:Short term target (Should be soon) - $0.070 to $0.080 Range (which is close to what Dr Hou bought in and a likely placement price),btohqsg
