tbf he didnâ€™t rev when his car is stationary  it was only when he wanted to move. prolly manual car ah,btohqsg
LOL I WAS BEHIND THE CAR,btohqsg
But its not a real sports car.,btohqsg
Insurance categories it as sports car.,btohqsg
I don't think insurance categorized this as under sports car... lol,btohqsg
He rev aggressively to move. Even if you have a twinplate or a super single clutch  you don't need such high revving to move lol,btohqsg
In case anyone wonders  i have owned cars with both type of clutches  and with loud exhaustðŸ˜œ,btohqsg
Hope I can afford a manual car in near futureðŸ˜š,btohqsg
Idk if insurance want to  but idk why sgcm categorized this a sports car.,btohqsg
Sgcar mart is very fake in their reviews.  It seems like they are paid to give false good reviews.  Otherwise how they survive,btohqsg
@rng123456bro you like the bringer of negative news. Have some positive things once in a while la,btohqsg
I am the honest news man,btohqsg
As for Xmax   no Nedd to say much.  Yamaha bikes very reliable one,btohqsg
This applies to any other platform. Shopee or lazada,btohqsg
Maybe can try China brand alr.,btohqsg
Nope.Sgcarmart.comdepends on  advertising  reviews to survive,btohqsg
The only thing i dont like about SGCM is their badly designed website. Their online content all over the place. I prefer Carro,btohqsg
Take their car reviews with a pinch of salt,btohqsg
Car reviews don't only read from one source,btohqsg
I also ask for opinion here and car forums. Lol,btohqsg
But as long you buy new  doesn't matter as long you got warranty,btohqsg
