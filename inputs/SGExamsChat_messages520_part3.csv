Do you take the North-South and East-West Lines regularly? New MRT trains on these lines will have more open spaces  large windows and “ergonomic perch seats”.https://cna.asia/42dRAYV,btohqsg
Gotta find@SMRTCEOto explain for us this new model,btohqsg
Idk probably can tell us the make and model what hp and how many carriages,btohqsg
all u need to know was this model was one of the last orders received by Bombardier (DT line) before they gt acquired by Alstom (NE/CC lines),btohqsg
Gonna know if it was retrofitted and the assembly of the carriage bro,btohqsg
Also did they change the interface system or is it intercompetitble,btohqsg
Also what are the track gauges,btohqsg
no. it ‘s a new model assembled in China. the interface & track gauge is the same (1435mm),btohqsg
Wasn't it the same factory like I think Alstom bought over the Bombardier division for trains or smth,btohqsg
yes Alstom only carried on to fulfill this order,btohqsg
i thought you were referring to the laptop brand T^T,btohqsg
Interesting fact tho the HP company was spun off into 2 groups so the laptop division is in HP Inc with HP enterprise taking the server and business side,btohqsg
was discussing with a friend  and we came to the conclusion21k is the intake for 202066.9 k is the total enrolment from 2018 to 2020So technically  not 1/3 graduate from each batch but 1/3 of the enrolment graduate each year  which make sense since poly is a 3 years course,btohqsg
Here's the thing tho taking the numbers at absolute  the enrollment numbers for poly is decreasing and to a significant extend,btohqsg
YOY from 2020 to 2021 it is a 3137 drop in enrollment for polys,btohqsg
so give on take abt 1000 people across the 5 polys dont graduate when they join poly,btohqsg
The numbers point to something as well.. pre university as a whole has been decreasing enrollment numbers for like 6-7 years straight alr but uni numbers are going up,btohqsg
But it is still damn little tho.. for every 1 uni spot there is 4.18 graduates available to fill it,btohqsg
We come out of covid just for us to wear mask again,btohqsg
