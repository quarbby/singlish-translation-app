Rs 3 is then even match,btohqsg
Ok sorry for sweeping statement. Keyword is “most”,btohqsg
megane rs was 0.6 secs faster than rs3 round nurburgring,btohqsg
no need rs3  bring hot hatch  can beat model 3 already and do it for more than 3 laps also without running out of juice,btohqsg
Driver is the issue I am talking about car spec s,btohqsg
Megane RS 7:40.1RS3 7:40.7Tesla M3 Performance 7:44,btohqsg
maybe you decide what you want to compare first  cornering  driver  straight line speed  price,btohqsg
then say can only compare rs3 and M3,btohqsg
I already said is price and spec,btohqsg
he give you list already of cars cornering better than m3p,btohqsg
if its 1 or 2 seconds  can be due to driver  4 seconds is like eternity on the race track,btohqsg

Tesla no good... the COE and road tax no good,btohqsg
just an opinion sir  you challenge to find better cornering car we do 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
I cornered 120km/hr on pie changi / clementi exit on my China car. Body roll was fantastic  3/4 of me on my driver door 😂 and could feel the wheels lifting up,btohqsg
but I think there is no best lah,btohqsg
even the germans acknowledge tesla is better,btohqsg
definitely better in flying cars to the moon,btohqsg
in what way? autonomous driving tech. sure  battery range  sure. Cornering? ACHTUNG,btohqsg

in handling and cornering. they say thumbs up!,btohqsg
the one not so good is the luxury feel,btohqsg
nah i own volvos  i love volvos but i dont go round blowing cows about them,btohqsg
who say? the german real or buy from alibaba?,btohqsg
you cannot argue with emotional people. there are many who just dislike tesla no matter what.,btohqsg
full throttle in a 1000+nm car on busy roads is really safe too :),btohqsg
How nice could it be if u can summon ur EV vehicle from MSCP to Void Deck Pick Up Pt. LOL,btohqsg
If there is distance and u are over taking u don’t full throttle before ?Your car so fast can teleport ?,btohqsg
Anyway does anyone knows about the Red TEsla driver which has been flipping his Finger on da road ? Has he been made famous yet? HAHA i hope he isnt here,btohqsg
Xpeng Nio Li Auto better screw tesla 😤,btohqsg

My chery was best. Paid 45k and corner at 120km to get 300k cars feeling cornering at 200km😂,btohqsg
