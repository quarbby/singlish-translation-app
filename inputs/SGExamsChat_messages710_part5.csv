SINGAPORE ‚Äì For more than 200 000 young Singaporeans  a unique online sanctuary has emerged for them to discuss their innermost thoughts on everything from examination stress to mental health to career anxieties.Started in 2017  this online community known as /r/SGExams exists as a forum on the social media platform Reddit and is run entirely by seven youth volunteers aged between 17 and 25.On /r/SGExams  one can find posts such as the confessions of a ‚Äú(soon-to-be) med school dropout‚Äù and a student who shed tears after a parent said  ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre more important than the exam‚Äù.Like other Reddit forums  users‚Äô posts can be upvoted or downvoted by their peers  which then determines how visible they are to others.Speaking to dozens of the forum‚Äôs active users reveals a community where anonymous users can speak candidly  with a sense of solidarity not easily found elsewhere.Blunt adviceSecondary school student Mohamad Hychael Mohamad Mohamad Zaidi  15  used the forum in 2022 and 2023 as a sounding board for stressful decisions  such as choosing his upper-secondary subject combination and whether to aim for polytechnic or junior college.Describing a post he made on the forum asking for advice  he says: ‚ÄúI felt like the responses resonated with me as they came from people who have experienced the system in recent memory.‚Äù‚ÄúI did consult my teachers  but I felt like I needed a bit more information before I made my final decision  so I decided to make that post ‚Äù he adds.His experience is not unusual  with similar posts popping up regularly. Part of the appeal stems from blunt advice offered by users  as compared with that from authority figures and official sources.Other topics touched on include what the culture of a campus hall is like  and why students might wind up loving or regretting their choice of polytechnic course.

Mr Chin says such posts are tightly moderated to clamp down on comments that encourage harmful behaviour.‚ÄúThough sharing these thoughts could hurt other students  we figured that it was important to keep that safe space ‚Äù adds Mr Chin  who is studying business at National University of Singapore.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an additional avenue for them to gain advice from their peers or seniors who may have walked a similar path and it may also benefit anybody else who relates to them.‚ÄùIndeed  Mr Pang  a computer science undergraduate at Singapore Management University  notes that he found it interesting how ‚Äúyounger folk tend to digest advice from strangers online better compared with those coming from an authoritative figure‚Äù.The number of users has grown steadily over the years  from 29 000 in 2019 to its current 226 000. It is the largest community on Reddit discussing education and student life in Singapore. In 2020  it also became a registered non-profit organisation.,btohqsg
Mr Pang and Mr Chin handed over the reins after five years to another team of young moderators  led by Mr Raphael Peck  22  who is in national service. They were avid users of the forum  who responded to a recruitment post and went through an interview process.Mr Peck says keeping the forum functional takes around three to four hours of his time each week  with the other six moderators on the team also putting in similar hours.That is time spent on moderating users‚Äô posts and comments  creating the community‚Äôs megathreads and putting together useful resources  such as Ask Me Anything threads with experts and professors.As for why this work is worthwhile  Mr Peck says the community ‚Äúoffers a sense of comfort that I am not the only one who has struggles in the competitive education system in Singapore  or who fears that making a wrong choice may drastically change my education options‚Äù.,btohqsg
