Best is you don’t get a car left 1 year ish and cannot renew,btohqsg
Anything to try to justify a higher price. Otherwise how to make it look like a “rare good buy”?,btohqsg
@AaronMichaelyour friend right? Maybe can ask him why so funny one. Looks so suspicious how to sell lidat.,btohqsg
Channeling more energy to acceleration lah,btohqsg

Or still have high COE levels when it comes to renewal.,btohqsg
I was just thinking if change my expenses reduce by 400 per month,btohqsg
But i am so screwed when dis does still occur like now,btohqsg
Coe levels still maintaining or worse goes up,btohqsg
I think coe will maintain or gradually increase . They need to tax back and put back into the reserve the money they use to help the people,btohqsg
Only property & car can provide them with such high returns….,btohqsg

“Once we can sell you a flying car for the same price as a Tesla  you’ll quickly see the balance shift. Today  private cars outnumber taxis by about 300 to one  so the potential for people to own and drive their own flying car one day is absolutely enormous. It’s a very exciting time ” claims Pearson.,btohqsg

If you smart with your ways,btohqsg
Older cars usually more ex insurance,btohqsg
not necessarily. many factors come into play  like model  make  age of driver  coverage  insurer,btohqsg
but boss Imran familiar  his shitbox honda insurance higher than if he buys a new civic,btohqsg

Driver record and the car both make a difference,btohqsg
Cheaper if you only buy for 3rd party cover  i.e. if crash then just scrap rather than repair,btohqsg
If buy with loan  forced to buy comprehensive,btohqsg
JUST AS I WAS TALKING ABOUT KOUP,btohqsg
u never know one day if u urself bang LTA barrier,btohqsg
hor hor the amt u need pay,btohqsg
Comprehensive too if buy car left with 2 weeks to scrap?,btohqsg
I don't know if anyone's willing to insure that,btohqsg
who wud buy a 2 week old car?,btohqsg
buy 1 year comprehensive insurance. Cancel after 2 weeks. Big loss.,btohqsg
Like I said  I don't know who's willing to insure you for a car with 2 weeks left sir,btohqsg
And on this  usually one can just rent the car from the current owner and let them keep the scrap value,btohqsg
Drive under their insurance as an unnamed driver with a higher excess,btohqsg
Most insurance can do.. Buy 1 year policy,btohqsg
66k leh.. and no exhaust idw,btohqsg
Some ppl may sell at parf +body value. If buy  can drive free 2 weeks. But insurance u settle…,btohqsg

soft top is the best top,btohqsg
looks like thats golf is the cheapest cabriolet in sg,btohqsg
but is it more fun than miata?,btohqsg
Miata is like a go kart,btohqsg
Latest news:Grab will be pausing our Vehicle Age Requirement policy with immediate effect  until further notice. This means driver-partners with vehicles aged 10 years and above can continue to drive with Grab.,btohqsg

roadtax cheap when your car spends half the time in workshop,btohqsg
not too familiar so cannot advise which one better,btohqsg
E serirs cabriolet not too bad,btohqsg
so i guess better not consider this BMW right,btohqsg
Maybe not the specific unit you shared,btohqsg
The roof mechanism is known to have issues so better ppi,btohqsg
wow i just realised there is a 1.0 turbo civic,btohqsg
There’s a 1.5 vtec turbo that is cheaper,btohqsg
why civic depre so crazy now?,btohqsg
i think this one under cat B,btohqsg
Then might as well get the fc,btohqsg
cannot afford 😢and not really into SUVs,btohqsg

no turbo might as well get hyundai avante  interior and exterior looks so nice,btohqsg
you want a car that looks nice  good fc  low depre  low road tax where to find,btohqsg

3rd friday  i already got 3 cashback in a row,btohqsg
Sometimes i wonder are they washing the money from black to white?,btohqsg
100k transaction = $$300k in 1 day,btohqsg
4 friday ( 1 month) will be 1.2M already,btohqsg
They might as well give us more interest,btohqsg
1.2 m in 1 month is only 14.4 m a year,btohqsg
this is nothing if they can get 2million users to be regular users,btohqsg
2 million = txn fee 0.50 cents per day,btohqsg
JUST buy getting ppl to use the app alone,btohqsg
I seldom use the app   i use only when i can get more or further discount,btohqsg
So near only. Your car water leak very serious?,btohqsg

Thats only if my car really breaks down.,btohqsg
Integrated circuits  semiconductor driven etc etc,btohqsg
Oh~ i guess. Kinda annoying when there is demand. Conspiracy theories kicking in. Kidding.,btohqsg
It’s true that it has caused supply chain issues globally,btohqsg
😔😔😔 life sucks. Hope ukraine war stops soon,btohqsg
I want oil price to drop,btohqsg
Usually if you source from Europe or US they might have faster then just pay for shipping lor. Or if not ask local stockist to send in on special delivery for you.,btohqsg
What other parts are you looking for?,btohqsg
On the water pump if you have not changed in before in 7 years I think it is probably time before it breaks down,btohqsg
Especially in our high frequency  short cycle driving patterns in Singapore. Think about the thermal impact. All brands will go through the same impact.,btohqsg
It's an issue with all cars these days,btohqsg
Global logistics and supply chain (sorry for my french) have been Fked,btohqsg
When something breaks it doesn’t necessarily mean that the brand is no good.,btohqsg
Coz more mechanical than electronics driven? SMART!!!!!!!,btohqsg
Also hard to find parts  most workshops just sell you recon parts,btohqsg
but but.. today’s consumers like smart cars leh. Lots of LED  lots of touch screen  lots of sensors. Lots of logic.,btohqsg
New parts not always readily available,btohqsg
