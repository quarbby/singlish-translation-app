Hi Guys My OCBC 360 acct has met the criteria of Salary bonus in June. From the online banking website under my 360 acct page  it also reflects there was $1800 salary credited. This amount was credited via Fast transfer under Salary mode with comment ‚ÄúSAL‚Äù.However  I DO NOT receive the Salary Bonus  and only receive Save bonus on 9thJul.Anyone has encountered above issue? Thank you for ur advise.üôè,btohqsg
They from the start don't even support AMEX. And no rewards for top-up anyway.,btohqsg
yea  guess they patched the loophole,btohqsg
utilities i.e. SP excluded. M1 should get 5% if pay on M1 website/app,btohqsg
Seems like so. So many dps this month points to not working liaos.,btohqsg
U can call their customer service and ask.,btohqsg
I'd not advise this unless it was genuine salary transfer. Ocbc may request OP to show proof of salary like payslip.,btohqsg
Can Call. And later tio ban for gaming the system. üòÇ,btohqsg

Just to share an unpleasant experience with UOB recently.Have UOB one account and debit card with them.The bank have deducted the wrong amount instructed by merchant .Spoken to customer service officers and they want me to reach out to the merchant to obtain the conversation and send back to them for investigation  this will take a long process.Advised them to liaise directly with the merchant but was rejected and claimed that it‚Äôs the client who authorised the deduction.The officer also mentioned that the bank will deduct the amount by the merchant as long as the authorisation is given. Think there is a serious lapse here as the merchant may authorise the wrong amount.Also why the ‚Äúfault‚Äù is on the client and shouldn‚Äôt the bank provide the service of liaising with the bank.Just an experience to share and hope everyone exercise more caution when using your debit card.,btohqsg
Updated post woth tnc  but did not state the fulfilment time,btohqsg
Ouch. That's why credit card is always safer.,btohqsg
Yup  good lesson learnt  also intend to close account with UOB and switch to OCBC since they provide a poor. customer service,btohqsg
Wait till u experience ocbc customer service,btohqsg
My experience with ocbc wasn't that great üòÉ,btohqsg
No  unless they changed. Initially applied for a sub card for my wife. Her spending tracked down but not fulfilling the $500 spending UOB One Account,btohqsg
Oh  cash back  not the 500 spending,btohqsg
should fulfil 500 card spend of main card holder,btohqsg
Confirm plus chop.OCBC is the worst. Even though it has an outlet in my Fujian hometown.They reject me so many times saying I never meet $30k annual salary. So frustrating.,btohqsg
he citing the 500 spending for uob one account,btohqsg
Even SP power works. It‚Äôs not difficult.,btohqsg
I thought your favourite bro is aaron. I saw the clip you interviewed him on the miles game. Is because of your clip. I change from cash back to rewards and miles,btohqsg
I learn from both chris  aaron and you too,btohqsg
This I agree with you also.,btohqsg
Why you want to sow discord between their friendship?,btohqsg
No l√†... I just only chat only... all are good bros,btohqsg
Coz you ask chris who his fav bro,btohqsg
Anyone signed up for HSBC advance via singsaver and have gotten the sign-up gift?I'm wondering if simplygo is considered qualifying spend under the campaign.,btohqsg
I learning from Chris on his miles game. And kelvin on investing ..,btohqsg
If merchant charged you wrong amount  can't go back to them and ask for refund?,btohqsg
Standard reply: We will get back to you in 3-4 working days.,btohqsg
Actually my greatest concern is why the bank did not verify with the clients b4 making the deduction? If there an error in the deduction  shouldn‚Äôt the bank be also held responsible and contact the merchant. It will be also easier for them to liaise with the merchant rather than client- merchant- client- bank- merchant- client.,btohqsg
Wait. Who made mistake? Did client ask for correct amt but bank deducted wrong? Or client asked for wrong amt and bank deducted that amount?,btohqsg
