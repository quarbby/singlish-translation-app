Global Focus for 2023 - Energy crisis as priority.My view is that many energy counter will be in big play from Dec 22 onwards.Coal and LNG counters to have more focus as many nations will turn to these fossil fuels due to it being the cheaper and more available alternatives that are easier accessible and transported.,btohqsg
Interesting ü§® Indeed  Right after hands are shook for the 20B deal to transition l.Hmmm  No need for more wordsGeo Energy ($0.355) clearly undervalued counter I will not be surprised for half or even double bag in 2023. DYODD too. As long as the energy crisis persists  my view remains.Source:https://news.mongabay.com/2022/11/indonesia-to-build-coal-plants-despite-20b-deal-on-clean-energy-transition/amp/,btohqsg
Geo energy at a bargain now since it‚Äôs consolidating here at support before the $0.01 dividends in Dec 22.,btohqsg
Am visualising plenty of energy related crisis news popping in the big news channels as we move into winter period.Unfortunately  but this would bring about max attention to energy counters.Geo is the only one left in SGX as GEAR is going for the delist.I‚Äôm imagining the GEAR BBs coming into GEO too  interesting it shall be,btohqsg
Pollux support and buy zones $0.038 to $0.040 is where I will add or collect some.It just broke up of a near term downtrend pressure line with some volume building for the reversal.If market maintains  should see them make a move up. If it does OSOD to TP thanks üôèüèª,btohqsg
As anticipated  the energy crunch/demand  news are starting to pour in. But as usual  many retailers will prefer to buy  for example when crazy euphoria sets in. When the mainstream media is on it  even GEO at $0.50/$0.75/$1.00 etc  people will still buy.(Covid-19 was the biggest play in 2020 where stocks like medtecs from $0.04 to $1.98 and many eventual got stuck and became bag-holders)I believe Energy crunch might yet be the biggest play in 2023). My view  calculated approach as I study GEO FA  cash position  NAV  demand for their products and macro view.Also  I hope retailers are starting to get smarter and make better bets and investments and get in at cheap/good value before any possible pump comes .Together  retailers we can get there. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüí™üèºüí™üèºüí™üèº,btohqsg

Dec 2022.Start of winter. This winter not gonna be easy one.Energy crunch and shortages of power will hit quite many places.Also  dividend record date as below,btohqsg
Price should maintain about here up til record date I reckon,btohqsg
Dec have somewhat been a good months for Geo energy2020 - $0.120 to $0.1852021 - $0.275 to $0.350(Ukraine War is ongoing and started 24th Feb 22)2022 -We have to understand that the war Is causing big energy crunch that will be felt across the world especially in the heating seasons.Even last year  China had plenty of power and black out issues and this was before the war happened.Therefore  I‚Äôm expecting big Maruzubo for Geo energy in Dec22.Expecting big share buy backs to come in too since they have 300 mil .I‚Äôm not sure but guess that company cannot do SBB during dividend period ?But once dividend settled  they might do so since they did clear up $0.355 to $0.370 in 30Sept22.,btohqsg
Everyone should watchlist Geo Energy as we move into Dec22. üôèüèª,btohqsg
Will gap up . See how powerful the BBs on Monday. Will add some on Monday if gap not too big,btohqsg

ki again.. Newcastle Coal 362USD/T lo.. Wet weather and flooding brought to Australia by La Ni√±a phenomenon have hit coal production for miners  including Glencore  BHP  and Anglo-American.,btohqsg
Meanwhile  Indonesia's coal exports are expected to rise but remain below the government's target. On the demand side  increasing energy security concerns in Europe  exacerbated by a ban on Russian coal  forced the reactivation of coal power plants. At the same time  India's thermal coal imports surged 14% in the first ten months of 2022  as electricity demand increased because of a heatwave and a pickup in economic activity. .,btohqsg
Power . Copen ec 100% sold liao .huat ah all owners,btohqsg
December should be very good for coal stocks  can see they are gearing up for a run.Nov drop because of COP27. So funds they short coal counters  but nothing decisive and concrete to phase out coal came from cop27 as they could not commit due to energy crunch.Hence Once they cover the shorts  all will follow  I reckon it be too risky for the short sellers especially when coal prices start to run up too  they will be in haste to cover and might result in some squeeze,btohqsg

Recap for today.I think today might be a day for the illiquids with Acrometa business turnaround and growth leading the play.Easy Buy call for Acrometa at 0.070 and below. Counter if light  so if in play might fly. This might be the old Eindec of 2020Hong Lai Huat   same range counter might be pulled up too. Can watch closely as they were played about same period,btohqsg
Some background on what Acrometa is doing.- 1-10k Cleanrooms  controlled environments design and construction projects- Life Science Incubator (Start ups related)- Bio waste to energy plant- Specialist engineering (HVAC),btohqsg
Do note that Acrometa total shares in the market is only 138 mil shares.This one  very good option for BBs. It can get very interesting indeed.True liquidity range is above $0.1x .Calling BBs  very good opportunity for you guys. Chose properly üí™üèº,btohqsg
Recap on Acrometa. This float is small so it can seriously cornered.I believe the BBs have loaded 3 to 4 rounds. Hence  hoping to seat back and watch how they unfold,btohqsg
