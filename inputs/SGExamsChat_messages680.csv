Ok maybe gonna sound asshole but,btohqsg
The only person responsible for our emotions and how we regulate is ourselves,btohqsg
i feel like her stepping away from this chat for now is a good thing cause i dont think this is a suitable environment for her,btohqsg
i can gets feeling dumb and privately saying that but in public gc well..,btohqsg
Yes it's fine to feel like crap,btohqsg
It's fine to not be fine,btohqsg
U need to control how U act,btohqsg
How about after you give 白金 for my funeral? Only then I might be able to give u an answer by sending the universe a signal,btohqsg
Esp when how U act can affect others,btohqsg
50% meh? We’re just back to 2020 prices,btohqsg
it's just at some point it's too overly....altho I agree the word I use is abit insensitive,btohqsg
ok tbf i did use to rant alot about bad grades and stuff but to like my best friend (Or at least i thought she was)in private ... And then she decided to tell the whole class i was an attention seeker... when the reason why I ranted to her was because she scored higher than me 🤡🤡,btohqsg
i've been working the entire day,btohqsg
I sat in rainer dumke lecture on schrodinger eqn,btohqsg
nah lol. not asshole at all,btohqsg
prioritising yourself and dealing with your own issues isn't selfish,btohqsg
i can show you the QM i'm doing,btohqsg
i have a study channel ah i dont rant about it but i do address it  i think the difference is if you are in a public gc you can acknowledge you dont know smth but not take it as a joke (?),btohqsg
how does that sound like an asshole 😂😂,btohqsg
it's fine and normal to sometimes seek reassurance and get it out bc it takes a load off your mind,btohqsg
im sure youre self aware so dont worry ah,btohqsg
dont overdo ba. and dont do it with ppl that you not close,btohqsg
Actually tbh right  i would say this is a common trait among yi  but I would say some if not most would blame something else,btohqsg
i mean people also need to be more direct when they aren't equipped for someone ranting,btohqsg
"By all means if she were to come back in a ""btr state"" ( Ik really bad way to put it )   idt anyone of us would be that unwilling to chat as per usual",btohqsg
Like ppl say here say there we no culture and all  but they are also the same ppl who skip like our sch events,btohqsg
i do have that feeling too ah but i know its true then i just find other things i can do cuz it will overwhelm me too much thinking i couldn't hack it in jc 💀,btohqsg
Like literally ppl fail also blame yi  like srsly  you could ask ppl for help  go internet search  look at your notes etc etc,btohqsg
"not say self-centred  is more of if you cant self-regulate (TRUST ME ITS HELLA TOUGH TO LEARN IT IF YOU DONT HAVE IT) youd feel mildly attacked that ""easier said than done"" feeling",btohqsg
I mean tuition also can uh (if can afford uh but still),btohqsg
Is whether you have the effort to look at the information given to you,btohqsg
My Cher made me think abt stuffIf y'all complain so much abt certain cher  y'all gonna die in uni,btohqsg
Ah icic  is it me or I feel like self-love is a very foreign concept to many,btohqsg
Esp uk if majority of us are brought up in those asian typical households,btohqsg
tbh  some parts of the school sucked ah  i get the ideology of putting better teachers to better bands but.. not to the extent that the not so smart ones (me) cant even comprehend or learn how to learn (i was band 8 all the way  1 sem of band 5 made my mind blown at how much i could understand),btohqsg
Find little quirks abt u that,btohqsg
Is not a foreign concept  but tbh I never felt that before haha,btohqsg
Life is prolly a bit easier to live,btohqsg
i dont get the yijc slander. like honestly  so what if the sch isnt good at all? not good notes? check holygrail. the enviormnnt shldnt have an effect on u. is how u choose to act in it.,btohqsg
it's easier to recognise things about ourselves we dislike la,btohqsg
Oh yea actually right I realised,btohqsg
I had kumon sooo self directed learning! Teachers who?,btohqsg
"normal  i mean imagine for your earlier part of your life youre in a system where ""bad = failure"" (to put it more bluntly) and whilst having that you also have family pressures (for some la)  societal biasness  bound to happen that some can self love with the right environment whilst the rest well.. are stuck in the cycle of trying and failing (me lol)",btohqsg
Normally if we talking abt yi  they wont actually think about holygrail,btohqsg
Frfr jp starts math first topic with vectors :D,btohqsg
Maybe that explains why I straight up don't bother spending as much time w ppl ik still playing around 💀,btohqsg
But i would say in terms of yi  they are not very good at obtaining educational resources.,btohqsg
I saw some girl from my sec sch get 3 awards so my goal is to do well n get award + money,btohqsg
Seems like a win win to me,btohqsg
Often we are our own harshest critic 🤡,btohqsg
tbh i feel it's not a yi thing,btohqsg
I see the notes in ri,btohqsg
this is basically the whole idea lol,btohqsg
I mean is the same content...,btohqsg
"""Whenever we confuse selection factors with results  we fall under swimmers body illusions. When it’s talking about top graduate schools then Harvard  Oxford  MIT  IIM comes on top and it is considered that pass out from those colleges will give huge success in professional life but is it true always? It may be possible that they give admission to already bright students so they do well and get a good professional life.""",btohqsg
Actually tbh at that time i felt like yi econs notes were bad 😂,btohqsg
"i gets but as someone who gets overwhelmed with tips its challenging to not have this mindset that i was in a decent school when the resources i had to rely on was outside notes  i can gets not liking yijc but i dont get those who just generalise yi = bad with just stereotypingmine i had my reasons  others was ""just because""",btohqsg
Everyone in tm clowns on TM econs notes thi,btohqsg
Feels more like a meme than anyth,btohqsg
Fr math i do like a small compiled version of the chp,btohqsg
So idn keep flip flip through notes,btohqsg
I think is like more of low self confidence issue bah,btohqsg
i do but then i got overwhelmed with my own notes 💀,btohqsg
Then try to make sure the,btohqsg
Points in subheading alrd in head,btohqsg
For me I draw my notes,btohqsg
Closer to exam kinda prep ah,btohqsg
i just write everything in the way i understand it in my head,btohqsg
I put in cartoon in my chem notes,btohqsg
I draw until i dont dare throw them,btohqsg
i get overwhelmed by wordsi cant read straight lines so i have to listen to auditorial. so when i watch lecture videos and write it down i can process it cuz im listening  but when i look at the notes  i see words  get overwhelmed tada,btohqsg
Fuck bro for pure bio back in sec sch I rmb I had to vomit out one mindmap for each chapter completed,btohqsg
Do u try like aft u write u like,btohqsg
thats pretty much why i couldnt revise for a levels until dying last min with a butt load of coffeei just ONLY studied the night before 12-5am,btohqsg
it feels nice to have nice looking notes tho bc i end up just remembering what the notes look like,btohqsg
i cant even process when i read out loud,btohqsg
mindmaps might be btr then reading an entire paragraph of words,btohqsg
my notes are basically putting my visions into words,btohqsg
my dad realised this issue when he asked me to read out an article,btohqsg
tbh it varies from person to person,btohqsg
"and i said ""i dont know what i read""",btohqsg
i will stare at the lines and get confused..,btohqsg
idk i get overwhelmed by the eyes,btohqsg
NO BUT THE PROBLEM IS I REMEMBER IT BEING ON PAGE 3 TOP LEFT BUT I DNT REMEMBER WHT I WROTE SPECIFICALLY 😭😭😭,btohqsg
side note but throughout undergrad i tried explaining to this one friend how i visualised things in my head to understand very quickly,btohqsg
It's a mind map so if your mind is fucked and unclear... How do u map out your own mind,btohqsg
1.5 years after graduating we all found out including her that she has aphantasia,btohqsg
I was literally copying word for word back then from my tb,btohqsg
Yah but back then no choice Cher wanna see,btohqsg
my notes are word for word from my lecture vid,btohqsg
somehow the ONLY notes i can process,btohqsg
cuz i can imagine the prof reading it  idk,btohqsg
I felt so overly overwhelmed cause it might not be up to standard to him in terms of ig info wise and what's to know  not know,btohqsg
mine is watch lecture video like one concept -> pause to digest and think through until i can visualise and explain it in my own words -> write down in my own words,btohqsg
My little pony twilight sparkle power of friendship,btohqsg
My notes are i jst skim through lecture first,btohqsg
u guys make ur own notes?,btohqsg
i process best when i do what everyone says not to do pause write rewind pause rewind,btohqsg
If i dnt rly get it ill refer to tht specific part to verify,btohqsg
making them seems so time confusing,btohqsg
But it's more like I note take during tutorial n lect,btohqsg
oh i have no questions ish,btohqsg
feel like i understand better by just doing qn,btohqsg
maybe thats why i like coding and not theory,btohqsg
Cause fr me i jst gas qn HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
mg coding i get close to full marks  theory pulls me down,btohqsg
I redo my notes uh  but honestly it is effective if you start at j1 and you do consistently,btohqsg
But if dk i refer to notes lor,btohqsg
but yi is a decent sch,btohqsg
But mafan flip2 so i make mini compilation of the key points,btohqsg
this sort of thing satisfying to look back on,btohqsg
my notes are like 1+ hr lecture condensed into 2 ish page unless is HEAVY (computer security.......) then its like 5 pages 💀,btohqsg
i didnt like it cuz of the people i surrounded myself around,btohqsg
A lot yi people have this mentality,btohqsg
so i ended up rejecting retaking the a lvls,btohqsg
Like “I in yi so I cfm cannot score well” type of mindset,btohqsg
Meanwhile the teachers are there to help,btohqsg
some *my *uhem* econs band 8 teacher was not doing anything,btohqsg
Some people takes longer time to learn ba,btohqsg
i didnt even realise until i was miraculously pushed into band 5 for a semester,btohqsg
She went to seek help in the yi chat already,btohqsg
Is she the kind say cannot perform but does nth abt it,btohqsg
Now she can do long division,btohqsg
went back to band 8  asked her questions she couldnt seem to help,btohqsg
That’s why I say need longer time to understand certain math concepts,btohqsg
which year you took a levels LOL,btohqsg
hey yall! does anyone have monitor recommendations for ps5? idk if prism is overrated,btohqsg
idk whr my grad cert is,btohqsg
i see! i saw asus was good  however im not familiar w the brand,btohqsg

i think 21.5 quite good alr,btohqsg
cos it’s not like i’m playing w anyone else,btohqsg
ik a bit more about her. she does have an array of psychological disorders and she does see her psychiatrist. but her family is not doing anything to help at all. apparently her mum kept comparing her to her sister  about how she spent 10 times more on medical bills than her sister  how her mother wished she aborted her  etc. These probably contributed to her low self-esteem,btohqsg
do you want like specs to search through or just specific recommendations,btohqsg
no wonder how she first thing say she stupid,btohqsg
I mean to be fair if no one wants to listen to her then why not jst vent to a bunch of strangers? Not to mention it wldnt affect ur rls cause if u mention these kind of things to people u actually know they cld view u differently,btohqsg
oh right she does have some medical stuff,btohqsg
If it's once in a while,btohqsg
but nah still the public isn't gonna coddle her,btohqsg
Like quite stereotypical ah most families view them as crzy,btohqsg
i spill wtv im ok with,btohqsg
If it's all the fucking time,btohqsg
Soz my whole personality is shitting on my principal 😔,btohqsg

yeah i also heard most staff was from tp,btohqsg
idk where did fairness meet the government,btohqsg
they are the cause of the bad merger what,btohqsg
u think hving the sch location means anything  it is the people who runs the school that decides how it is run what  the location means nth,btohqsg
A levels hold pen not hold hand,btohqsg

good luck to me who have 3 mid-terms next week  my brain is not alive sia at this point,btohqsg
hoe does si yan survive phd,btohqsg
actually y'all in nus or ntu,btohqsg
uk i would actually / may go NIE if NIE is nearer lol coz idw go NTU coz idw stay on campud,btohqsg
ehh same sia i got 3 quizzes plus 1 presentation bef recess  3 more after recess. just did my microecons midterms today and im fucked,btohqsg
i remembered my tutor saying some parts of ntu can receive malaysia network,btohqsg
i have microecons midterms on monday  hvnt started revision,btohqsg
but econs in uni is full of math sia  i actually cant finish 1 quiz (but prof is nice enough to give 3 attempts to all the quizes),btohqsg
pharmacy  but im taking a econs mod as ue,btohqsg
yeah. my microecons midterms today was just math. but in reality i just “random bs go”,btohqsg
no matter how shitty they can be  this is ridiculous,btohqsg
my microecons mod midterms was all open-ended qns,btohqsg
i wouldnt even have this thought in my head,btohqsg
wah if it is this i may not take coz i taking this econs mod to pull up my cap lmao,btohqsg
i'm still slowly adjusting the way i work until it hits the sweet spot for phd,btohqsg
some people taking reddit anonymity to write all these crap,btohqsg
i fr have love hate rs with my work,btohqsg
very true  truly immature and unappreciativ,btohqsg
i don't boulder as much now but bowling more,btohqsg
tbh my parents will never admit any wrongdoings  they are always right  so if im going against them  it will end with them getting angry and ignoring me for days,btohqsg
like hving talked to my mum properly for 2w alr,btohqsg
tbh my dad told me i was overreacting when i was having a panic attack and calmly told him i wanted to be excused but my dad learnt to after me fighting back with alot of logic to rebut him,btohqsg
at this point i just ignored my parents when it comes to things that step into my personal boundaries,btohqsg
until one day we kinda made peace with each other,btohqsg
tbh i regretted not just going with what i wanted,btohqsg
like when they say i cant join band  it never came across my mind what will/canthey do if i joined,btohqsg
i think in jc times it's still kinda understandable,btohqsg
but once uni hits you should just make all your decisions on your own,btohqsg
tbh i think uni they didnt really impose anything besides a curfew sort of (ok not really  it is just them telling me not to go home too late),btohqsg
it's the time to really just do wtv you want,btohqsg
it is actually dangerous coz of the extreme darkness,btohqsg
actually my brother takes the rebellious route until my parents let him do what he want,btohqsg
but i mean girl vs guy cannot compare la,btohqsg
eh for my parents i just showed them 1-2 sems of gpa,btohqsg
but i also had ns to force them to let go,btohqsg
yea but i think some people still their parents ask them go to x courses  which is not that right coz it is ur career sia,btohqsg
lol. when i was in sec 3/4  when i told my parents i going out  i faster went out bef they asked me what time i will come back 😂,btohqsg
my mom sleeps at 9pm so having a curfew won't do shit for me,btohqsg
he likes to assume that just because i fight with him i hate him  i do dislike him but i hate his assumptions (assuming i want nothing to do with him etc) so i do shout when i get pissed with his assumptions  then thats when he starts speaking with logic,btohqsg
actually in my recent argument with my parents  i kinda cant remember how it ended up with that but my mum got angry and say 'ok u can go listen to ur friends instead  dont come ask me for advice',btohqsg
my mom wakes up at 4am so,btohqsg
my mom and i started arguing more when i grew older bc i didn't just listen to her,btohqsg
that is early  my mum sleeps at 11-11.30ish  and the curfew wun really do anything unless i got into trouble outside (TOUCH WOOD) coz i hv the house key,btohqsg
my mom wakes up 4am to gym before work,btohqsg
recenly i argue w her more coz i told her straight up how i feel about the time when i was in j2 and my bro was in p6 at the same time. and she can say 'it is a fact in sg too bad psle is higher stake than A level',btohqsg
and my bro triggered first la by asking my mum if his As or my sis Os more important,btohqsg
is she proven right or just dun want to admit wrong,btohqsg
this is random but it was very funny that the MAF thing mr joey rote in my testimonial lol how i lead the class during MAF 2018 and 2019 and 1st place in 2019 (like it even made it to the first para of my really long testimonial),btohqsg
i have no say man i didnt get good a level score and just took a cs course in a not so good sch and i still can be around the tech companies i wanna be in,btohqsg
hmm idk then she say talking to me elevate her bp,btohqsg
eh cs is quite a niche and prestigious course,btohqsg
im just arguing to hopefully make her see her wrong and apologize or sth,btohqsg
"my fam went from complaining about grades to asking me to stop aiming for As because every semester i have minimum 5 meltdowns about ""not getting my first class honours""",btohqsg
i told her about this and she said 'because im always right',btohqsg
im alr seeing a level of difference,btohqsg
coz my bro is in jc now,btohqsg
then my dad say 'tennis ends in april  band ends when',btohqsg
lol my fam also. when a child of their friend suicide due to academic pressures  from in pri/sec sch keep complaining why i not highest in class to becoming “score average can liao”,btohqsg
then he said  u see he train anot...,btohqsg
i alr told him every cca have same training commitment sort of,btohqsg
lol they are defo more supportive of them  advising them run leadership position etc...but maybe,btohqsg
coz they are smarter than me,btohqsg
nah mine is diff  they still look down on people with mental health issues but i did scream for 3 4 hours and my mom knew my health was getting worse due to stress so she ask my dad to wake up also hahahha,btohqsg
isnt nsg like ltr than syf coz syf is just a single date,btohqsg
then my dad said 'dont bullshit,btohqsg
i dragging my feet to cca twice a week  lost complete interest within the 1st few months,btohqsg
this sort of info can find online easily,btohqsg
it is coz i dsa-ed into sec sch and my sec sch 3x a week training (but tbh sec sch vs jc training ofc jc is slacker?? common sense and also coz i came fr a sec sch that niche area is performing arts so what do u expect,btohqsg
and my dad call me mad woman for always arguing with them,btohqsg
i think cca is compulsory or is it just tm,btohqsg
yea we are quite bonded as a cca  it is just that i lost interest after a few months coz i suck at it lmao,btohqsg
i remembered i was just too dumb for shooting honestly  i tot the black thing is the target,btohqsg

i think both guys and lady same scoring no?,btohqsg
idk if i would be btr if pistol,btohqsg
tm only hv 1 guy and 1 girl,btohqsg

omg i went for archery trial. I cant even get the bow straight  it keeps shaking  and instead of going straight to target  it landed on the floor,btohqsg
i remembered one of the arrow actually went backwards idk ho,btohqsg
i cant even keep the bow straight,btohqsg
but actually i heard if ccas are nice enough  they will accept u if none of the other choices accept u,btohqsg
i did not go for shooting trial and i remembered it was a long queue,btohqsg
interact club would be more portfolio than shooting tbh,btohqsg
my batch the council pres in HnF sia  damn onz,btohqsg

How much harder is the math compared to h2 math,btohqsg
Now I’m questioning whether I should take Econs in uni,btohqsg
if you’re comfortable with H2 math you should be fine for the math in econs,btohqsg
the concepts are either H2 level or not far off but it’s more of understanding how they’re being used,btohqsg
I hated math but I can do h2 level math questions with a lot of practice. It’s like my aptitude is not very good but it’s sufficient such that I was able to make up for it with attitude  but I kind of don’t want to have to go through the suffering of spamming a lot of math qns again.,btohqsg
If I find that I hate other courses more then no choice but to just deal with the math in Econs I guess,btohqsg
Is it more of pure math calculus stuff than stats?,btohqsg

Is that how you normally ace your phy lab reports?!,btohqsg
imagine how many ppl alr know all her problems,btohqsg
and most of us cant rly do anyt other then reassuring her,btohqsg
i mean at a uni level you don't really have the luxury of spamming as many questions as you'd like. it's not like h2 where you basically have an endless supply. as a whole you gotta spend more time understanding the concept behind what you're doing bc there's the econs context to apply it to,btohqsg
eh now i wanna ask for practical advicehow do you forget someone you see every day ?,btohqsg
Calculus is kinda dead ish but not rlly,btohqsg
ah yea which isn't a bad thing for scoring,btohqsg
it gets less dead when you find more applications,btohqsg
you can't just forget someone. more of getting things going with your life as usual regardless,btohqsg
and less then 30 are active,btohqsg
my number of brain cells left,btohqsg
Maju  wah that's so long ago,btohqsg
I think h2 math is definitely harder than that  that one probably at most secondary level,btohqsg
Oh ok then is it like you can’t finish the quiz because the Econs concepts are harder to understand?,btohqsg
Not so much because of the math,btohqsg
H2 Maths is easy.It's dead. Which means you work hard sure can do,btohqsg
What's hard: You work very hard still cannot do,btohqsg
It is because im not fast enough w the math  but actually that was one quiz only la  coz it is 15qns 25min,btohqsg
however  hard work is subjective. I have seen students working 2 weeks before A levels  and claimed they worked hard for it but still fail,btohqsg
i feel like maths very abstract  u just drill and drill but u dont know what u are doing,btohqsg
Actually for micro econs  most are jc stuff except a few add on and the math,btohqsg
That's A level.Like me hor  I may have been among top 10 scorers in A level Physics in 2001 (still humble bragging oops)but I know most of my current knowledge came way after A levels. And I realised so many things I thought I knew at A levels  were actually not correct.I was one who didn't know what I was doing.,btohqsg
Meanwhile i actually dk HOW i slept until 10.30,btohqsg
Omg that was the yr i was born💀💀,btohqsg
didnt take o lvls  but it was only in uni where i learn how and why different equations and theories are like that,btohqsg
which means to say  for O and A levels  just drill and make sure answering techniques are there  you could do pretty well without 100% understanding what's happening.,btohqsg
because they gave some real world applications for it,btohqsg
I took H1 physics and always top it but i feel it is easier than O level physics💀💀,btohqsg
Or maybe it is just me drilling,btohqsg
Eh actually this is very true leh  like chem n phy i can drill to get v high,btohqsg
But definitely cant happen in uni,btohqsg
But tbh w/o the understanding it is also hard to drill tho,btohqsg
Wait ur sch only had 1 A or how did they determine the top 10,btohqsg
no  this is for entire Singapore,btohqsg
top 10 scorers for A lvl Physics,btohqsg
Like if u ask me  if i dun understand  it is q hard to push me to do papersOk but tbh A level stuff is pretty easy to understand,btohqsg
I dun care if i understand,btohqsg
I just whack formula for math,btohqsg
Oh…i guess they stop that coz ‘a move away fr grades’ lol,btohqsg
few years ago they stop  I think around covid time,btohqsg
I think it has not been there for very long alr,btohqsg
After 2013 they kinda stopped all the shit,btohqsg
bruhh wtff my ppd grp go kick me out say i nvr do work,btohqsg
then now my cher say vv messy,btohqsg
cuz they nvr tell him they tht kicking me out,btohqsg
i gna join another grp but cher say he cnnt confirm the change untill after holiday,btohqsg
istg if they rly sabo me say i nvr do work,btohqsg
even if i rly got do,btohqsg
Are u not close to the group then they just want sabo,btohqsg
but my cher now talking to them,btohqsg
Oh hopefully the teacher can talk sense into them,btohqsg
ya but rn he hearing frm both sides,btohqsg
I failed math prelims  spammed math TYS and prelim qns for one month then got A for a levels  so quite sure most ppl can get A for h2 math if they just set their mind on doing it,btohqsg
Tbh not everyone hv the skills but i heard ppl drilling to an A also,btohqsg
But it is those content subjects that can really be drilled,btohqsg
True. Math is the easiest to drill among all subjects  and since the answers aren’t as subjective as other subjects  it could be why math always has the highest distinction rate,btohqsg
Like i practiced chem and phy to a point that im seeing repeated qns in exam,btohqsg
the safety officer STILL hasn't contacted me yet,btohqsg
HE SUPPOSED TO CONTACT THE DAY BEF,btohqsg
you also did it for the entire year. I have seen students who didn't study for the entire 2 years,btohqsg
what was your ppd project on,btohqsg
I also barely any skills so just need a bit  like as long as your a math B3 and above I’m quite sure for a level math can guarantee the A as long as the person drills copious amounts of math qns,btohqsg
assignment 1 was on covid 19 misinformation,btohqsg
I tot H2 math is much more difficult than O levels,btohqsg
I didn’t do a lot of math qns before prelims lol. I did extra during tuition but I wasn’t like grinding math the whole time. I barely touched my sch tutorials too,btohqsg
So now ur cher helping u find another grp?,btohqsg
did they just steal part of your work and claim it as theirs then,btohqsg
Yeah but I think if a math can get a good pass right means the person has a sufficiently small aptitude such that he/she can make up for it with attitude,btohqsg
But if like no proper basic foundation in the first place no matter how much one practices it would be hard to get A,btohqsg
Like students who didn’t take a math in sec sch but took h2 math in jc,btohqsg
I WAS ABT TO SEND A PATIENT TO FKING NTFGH,btohqsg
istg my whole class is gna know bout this,btohqsg
So they dun do well inside me is a serve u right omo,btohqsg
yall work on your own documents or one document?,btohqsg
U urself dun care  no one can help u bruh,btohqsg
There's still enough done definitely. No one can do 1 or 2 questions per chapter and score A.,btohqsg
like my work all still there lah,btohqsg
cuz if one document got history saved one wat,btohqsg
but they claiming i nvr do,btohqsg
Yeah true. Thankfully my other subjects weren’t too bad so I could spend more time on math,btohqsg
I was actually cramping chem and phy the whole yr,btohqsg
Coz i wanted to stay top in phy  i cannot lose lmao,btohqsg
But arts subj is hard to drill coz it is damn time consuming and tiring,btohqsg
if u don't mind you can go around asking the ppl around you for advice as an indirect way of seeking help but that'll just blow up matters and dk if you are comfy with that,btohqsg
okay so apparently is cuz they go take another 2 ppl then nvr tell me so they kick me out,btohqsg
LMFAOO was this even confirmed by your ppd cher,btohqsg
he say he can oni chang my grp after march holiday,btohqsg
did i agree to them kicking me out? obvs not,btohqsg
And they didnt hv any grp before that?,btohqsg
they were frm a diff grp,btohqsg
hence y my cher say now vv messy,btohqsg
so basically now is i technically still in my old grp but i work with my new one,btohqsg
"So here's what happened:few weeks ago my sgt assigned another medic for this cover  ex bullmastiff  which was from 27th-28th feb. it was all fine until another fking 9 SIR medic injured himself and got like 3 months of excuse RMJ  this is the first time maju fked us up abt this  and because of this now the other medic had to mount at Sembawang wharves to help 9 SIR (supposed to be 9 SIR doing this as they are on ops now not us  but as of now they have only 2 FUNCTIONAL MEDICS  supposed to be 5  and we already have 5 functional ones (2 ORDing soon)So this made me the cover medic for this particular cover  and this happened even before the start of feb  and my sgt alr updated the contact for covering medic for the exercise.Fast forward to todaySafety officer still hasn't contacted me (even as of writing this message) and i was passive duty in the medical centre  at ard 945 ish i was informed that there was a sendout ro NTFGH for a case of abdominal pain  possibly another one for abnormal ECG reading. Just as i was ready to send out the patient to NTFGH  i saw an unknown contact calling me  i picked it up and he was the TO 💀 💀 💀. Basically what he said was ""Hi are you the covering medic for the exercise today? Im currently outside the medical centre ready to pick you up.FYI  i was on passive duty and ready to send out to NTFGH  that was the only thing that was in my mind  NOT TO BE READY FOR THE COVER TODAY.......i then informed my sgt that i had to go for cover right now and luckily there was another medicap centre medic willing to send out the 2 patients to NTFGH  while i was rushing to check medical stores and get ready emcool pads (for a 2 day cover too 💀)once i was done (at ard 10am ish) we went off to maju. it's almost 12pm and there is still 0 contact from the safety officer  and I have 0 idea of what the conduct is abt",btohqsg
yea uni forced me to reshape how i went about learning physics and math. couldn’t just blindly go about it anymore,btohqsg
Anyone in Olvl sgexams grp chat,btohqsg
💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀 💀,btohqsg
after5pm conduct for today end  then i gg back clementi for rest/resup,btohqsg
Eh Mr Tan! I can't tell if that's sarcasm in the later half 🗿🗿 wdym by were not actually correct,btohqsg
a lot of things i understood halfway and only the answering technique to it,btohqsg
The ancient of them all sia,btohqsg
Did uk which placing were u in,btohqsg
no  they only stop at top 10,btohqsg
they updated till 2010  but I think it went a few more years  not sure,btohqsg
somehow they miss my year  year 2001,btohqsg
Man how were people like that at that time still mentally sound in the human brain 😭😭😭,btohqsg
and back then shit were way more condensed and complicated too,btohqsg
Any good math tutors to recommend for secondary school? Can dm me. Thanks! :),btohqsg
Tbh  the math itself is not very difficult. The main difficulty will probably be trying to apply the math to economic concepts,btohqsg
I will say it’s a balanced mix of both,btohqsg
Just don’t take uni econs just cause u can bs well in a-level econs,btohqsg
Especially if ur math foundation is weak  u will die,btohqsg
yes... the difficulty lies in linking the 2 together and acting fast coz time constraint,btohqsg
tbh it is not really h2 math + econs  the math in uni econs is not really to the level of h2 math,btohqsg
lmao this is weird  idk what they doing  if im the cher  i will also be very confused,btohqsg
I mean if u take higher-level econs mods  some of these require mathematical knowledge higher than h2 math  but of course not to the level of taking uni math itself lol. But the main point is knowing how to apply the math to econs,btohqsg
ok tbh im just talking intro mod coz im taking it as an elective so the math is not that difficult,btohqsg
you are in y1 now is it,btohqsg
My microecons 1 mod  by lesson 3 alr throw in partial differentiation alr lol,btohqsg
i actually hv this friend in ntu double major econs + math,btohqsg
mine was i think in lecture 5 iirc,btohqsg
but i did kinda miss doing math,btohqsg
and i lucky i did not throw everything away,btohqsg
then why they dw group tgt first sia......wah it is really a mess like what ur cher say,btohqsg
and u know what the funny thing is. the math mod for econs students don’t teach them partial differentiation until week 4,btohqsg
oh im also doing ddp with eee haha. i also know a few math and econs friends  think entire 4 year enrollment got 39,btohqsg
nope  sorry. i only know like one from my batch,btohqsg
he also eee and econs ah,btohqsg
I think he told me before he do this ddp coz he wanna be teacher,btohqsg
Actually idk how this guy got close to mrs pang,btohqsg
yeah this sem he same class as me for one of the tutorials,btohqsg
I think she is fr batch,btohqsg
I dunno her class but she fr co,btohqsg
I think lexuan also fr tm,btohqsg
Btw tmjcians y’all want a bit of tea,btohqsg
So im not sure if mr yusof the pe cher is still in the sch,btohqsg
Oh god he was my pe cher and always release us 30min late for recess,btohqsg
So apparently  i heard that i think2019/2020  he became soccer teacher ic and then the mj chers got angry and try to get him out of the cca lol,btohqsg
what type of tea is that,btohqsg
This reminds me of always bring a packet of milo as energy booster to my econs class coz 1st period 2h econs:-(,btohqsg
I have never drank bottled green tea,btohqsg
Actually my econs cher gave me that idea coz she always brings a packet milo to class🤣🤣,btohqsg
And i decided to follow suit,btohqsg
Coz i mean i was sleeping avg of 3h in j2,btohqsg
technically if you sleep 3 hours at home and three hours at school you are sleeping 6 hours,btohqsg
too many sihui out there alr…it’s the female version of jun jie,btohqsg
apparently the human body was nvr meant to sleep 8hrs straight. 4hrs at night 4 hrs in day time,btohqsg
it’s okay i know three calistas,btohqsg
I was real crazy in j2 coz im not smart so i need to work crazy to get what i wanted,btohqsg
Actually i blacked out during pe before,btohqsg
And then when i was ok  the cher insisted i let my parents know,btohqsg
Well said but actually i cant sleep in the day  i can fall asleep on my desk but when i go to bed or really want a nap  i cant:-(,btohqsg
