This is for guys n gals,btohqsg
But itll be interesting to make separate polls for guys n gals... maybe,btohqsg
In the future u will definitely want to settle down for sure,btohqsg
LOL are the two 7+ kids just trolling ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
They trying to boost the low birth rates,btohqsg
Im surprised there are 2 out of 7 responses that say 7+,btohqsg
I think in sg its very possible to raise 7 kids. Nothing fancy and very simple living but really.. sg has every single thing catered for education and raising young kids,btohqsg
So if 2 ppl really want 7+ i can see why,btohqsg
This poll doesn't not reflect SG's birth rate,btohqsg
On a very small sample size,btohqsg
We can see that its left skewed,btohqsg
Can I don't get married and wants to have kids? ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
You wither have mental dissonance you haven't solved yet  or you can possibly adopt when you turn 30 or smth i forgot the age for it,btohqsg
Being a single dad in sg is messed up. The government barely helps you,btohqsg
"Singapore is not the place to be if youre not part of the ""normal""",btohqsg
Is that thai lol whats it mean,btohqsg
Why cant you be binomial instead  its so much easier to solve.....,btohqsg
So if no petrol can run on electric,btohqsg
Btw in geog right we learn this thing calledBiogeochemical reactions and biogeophysical morphology,btohqsg
Why are you discriminating against theological studies and project work ðŸ¥¶,btohqsg
Lets add in a moral element then,btohqsg
And cohere to form a roadmap for the future upcoming next up innovative experimental inventive plan,btohqsg
Bumping the polls again bc we be spamming up the chat,btohqsg
It's alr fking expensive for one,btohqsg
8 for huat  10 for soccer,btohqsg
How exactly are these kids gonna survive in a middle income household,btohqsg
Imagine how tiresome their homeâ€™s gonna be,btohqsg
No room to study alone and all that,btohqsg
What do u factor in to make it expensive ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Tuition is a luxury  but many people seem to forget that,btohqsg
Good question. There is a CNA documentary on a 7? Child household on youtube,btohqsg
Its a simple life for the family and kids but they make it work,btohqsg
Will it be the best for everyone involved according to their feelings about it and what society deems to be markers of success?No,btohqsg
Btw could i ask the 7+ kids people (26% out of 19 respondents)  are yall trolling or do you really have that goal?Will it be in singapore or a different country?What lifestyle and job will you be aiming for to support the family?,btohqsg
"Looks like you're more of a ""quantity over quality"" person",btohqsg
More of a different kind of quality,btohqsg
Personally i try to align myself more towards simple and decent living and a a lot of savings,btohqsg
Though i understand why some people choose otherwise. It feels good i suppose,btohqsg
You may say that now but it is more necessary than you think,btohqsg
Wait until it's your own children's turn to enter the education system,btohqsg
its not if it is cheap,btohqsg
Demand for tuition is income elastic,btohqsg
They wont be getting tuition unless theyre really bad or if they are very driven for a certain goal,btohqsg
Anyway im not staying here LOL,btohqsg
I doubt europe has such intense tuition regardless,btohqsg
So i probably wont be able to find it as easily and for such prices,btohqsg
or they dont study as hard,btohqsg
Asians are abnormal in terms of study ethic,btohqsg
thats why tuition in europe is not so rife,btohqsg
so all 2480 ppl here are abnormal,btohqsg
