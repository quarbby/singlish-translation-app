Eh so if u know what’s enough and u can’t reach that intensity,btohqsg
We really not trying to avoid the question,btohqsg
It's that the question isn't really possible to be answered,btohqsg
I once spent 10 months on the sat,btohqsg
I did papers that end up taller than me,btohqsg
Not impossible per se but it is really subjective,btohqsg
10 hrs a day looks like enough,btohqsg
Study and understand every concept to be tested,btohqsg
I screwed up and got 2240,btohqsg
Really  just study as hard as you can  make sure you understand the concepts  but don't overwork till you burn out,btohqsg
After that I did zero papers more and tried sat again,btohqsg
But saying all this stuff is pretty abstract,btohqsg
Its out of 1.6k uh no ?,btohqsg
I don’t think effort plays a huge role in my first and second test,btohqsg
Both times critical reading got 800 tho,btohqsg
So it’s luck cos writing is screwed up,btohqsg
A lot of idiomatic usage to memories,btohqsg
But the way u type reminds me of another user in this group,btohqsg
I thought AO is old policy,btohqsg
I thought now is AS and A2,btohqsg
Eh eh but what's AS then,btohqsg
Anyways  hardwork is not really much needed to do well for o level.I fooled around  slept during class and not do practice papers but scored raw 7.,btohqsg
Yeah that just indicates that hard work need pair with talent,btohqsg
i can’t exactly afford to slack that much :),btohqsg
If it’s true than it’s ok to say ma,btohqsg
It really depends on how fast u understand hahah,btohqsg
Honestly I just suggest you 10hrs a day,btohqsg
Yeah which is why people keep saying that only you know how much is enough for you,btohqsg
U understand the moment its being taught,btohqsg
If u fuck up with 10hrs a day,btohqsg
Ofc u dont need to study much,btohqsg
Mhm  if you manage to grasp the concept quickly  o level is a breeze.,btohqsg
I know people sleeping their entire lessons and lectures and still end up doing well for exam,btohqsg
The more impt thing is... even if u dont know how much u need to study u shoild at least start studying,btohqsg
U start now then u see how much MORE u need,btohqsg
He want be safer than sorry ma,btohqsg
u spend time asking people instead of acting on it,btohqsg
He maybe doing 20 hr days already,btohqsg
Okay lah true but i infer the opposite from what ive read sofar,btohqsg
i’d rather not blindly walk into something i know nothing about OR maybe i want to see where i stand amongst your answers,btohqsg
I just ballpark 10 hr per day for average joe,btohqsg
Everyone is different. To me studying 1hr a day was enuf. To someone else 3hrs is enuf others is 10hrs,btohqsg
There isnt a fixed answer everyone is different,btohqsg
Just give him one and end the topic,btohqsg
There is no definite answer to something subjective,btohqsg
Plus even if u decide to go with 10h a day  you also have to consider that you’ll burn out fast,btohqsg
if that’s what you make of it,btohqsg
Then 2 weeks b4 exam chill and don’t do shit,btohqsg
So there’s this sweet spot between 10h and 1h a day,btohqsg
Not only that. How much of the content u actuallt absorb and what do u do of that 10 hes,btohqsg
