Not sure how a $3.8mil bid by polestar lose to ioniq5’s $1.9mil bid haha. The only difference is polestar package 10yr maintenance,btohqsg
TP happy to top up $1.9mil for maintenance,btohqsg
Typical gahman appraisal of tender 😏,btohqsg
They just wanna have a conti car to drive,btohqsg
The 200k per car for 10 years dont make sense,btohqsg
Ur maintenance per year how much only?,btohqsg
the bidding process went wrong somewhere legit,btohqsg
Think they don't want to give Hyundai contract since they already setup a plant in SG for their ioniq.,btohqsg
Ya polestar 2 omv $40k nia,btohqsg
Profit $160k per car. Not sure what maintenance an EV need over 10yrs 🙃,btohqsg
Just help them pain the car to police colours and attach the siren haha,btohqsg
Bcos Hyundai dont dare to do maintenance on a high mileage electric vehicle,btohqsg
And SMRT has no experience in EV maintenance,btohqsg
Think the package is direct part exchange,btohqsg
Really meh? But now that u mentioned it.. i do see alot old mazdas previously,btohqsg
Tax payer money. The justification really not there. Later another brompton case,btohqsg
Can keep as long as possible,btohqsg
A lot goes into new gen police vehicles,btohqsg
I suspect they going to include additional power pack or battery to power the other electronics,btohqsg
The load  the gps  the cameras,btohqsg
Now big qn is maintenance contract is for how many years,btohqsg
power will just come from the car battery la,btohqsg
The S60  XC60 tht the sec comd uses  all has extra battery pack in e car,btohqsg
bruh if you use car battery to charge additional power pack  what's the point,btohqsg
Nt engh to power everything la,btohqsg
Tht small battery infrnt where gt engh,btohqsg
Cos i have sat n drove in one?,btohqsg
and now you're the expert in retrofitting police vehicles got it,btohqsg
Older gen cars dont come w maintenance. Its just purely buying.Retrofitting to add stuffs are done by contractors frm the supplier.Maintenance are done by SMRT. At least tht was where the vehicles r sent to,btohqsg
The S60 n XC60 died so often tht they have to modify and add another battery seperate frm the main car just to power the light bars n other additional electronics,btohqsg
The older avantes n altis tht i drove in the past  battery died so often tht some patrol cars have portable jump start in them,btohqsg
