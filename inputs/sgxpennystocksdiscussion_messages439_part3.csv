Hyphens Pharma - $0.315- Recent spike with volume forced the break out of this downtrend.- Successful breakout as price is still outside of the downtrend line after the flushing of contra players- last several rounds they have had difficulty breaking out but this time with the volume break out  the players have shown that they are committed- Yesterday  there’s some players using algo to protect and paint the chart.(See sell down and immediately the buy up at $0.315)- Decent trend with higher Lows formingFor those who can hold  it is an easy buy. It’s a matter of when that they will test $0.335 again and next time round should break easily.Good luck. DYODD,btohqsg
