But SP app only can apply one bill which mine already register. How about for other bill,btohqsg
can add the accts to ur app,btohqsg
only for new client? i realise existing client doesn‚Äôt have much benefit,btohqsg
against a date.. read the TNCs for full details.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/128891,btohqsg
Hi all  I don't bank In cheque at all,btohqsg
If a cheque is given to me  to bank in  either in uob  or dbs ..will the bank charge me anything for banking in a cheque?,btohqsg
Any UOB Krisflyer card holder here??I‚Äôd like to ask when we buy sq tickets using the card  when will the 3mpd be awarded?And it‚Äôs directly to my krisflyer?,btohqsg
No. Make sure you bank in at your bank. And fill the cheque with all the correct details.,btohqsg
One bonus interestInterest creditWhat does each mean for uob,btohqsg
Few days after your statement date. Direct to krisflyer,btohqsg
First one is the bonus interest of your UOB One account (~3.85%)Second one is the base interest of your UOB account (0.05%),btohqsg
My UOB ONE BONUS approx. $400 a mth. based on 100k deposit in One Acct. that‚Äôs about right  correct ?,btohqsg
Isn't uob one account supposed to be 5% for 100k deposit? I.e. $500?,btohqsg
It is better for you to read UOB Krisflyer TnC. There are more TnC you need to comply.https://www.uob.com.sg/assets/pdfs/kf_credit_card_full_tnc.pdf,btohqsg
there are 12 months in a year sir  not  10. 5000 / 12,btohqsg
Interest is calculated daily. Please multiply the interest earned daily with number of the days on that month. Ie. 30 days or 31 days.,btohqsg
When the award of Kris mile are credited is also stated in the TnC - item 1.4 and item 1.5,btohqsg
25k and more after 100k Put in uob stash?,btohqsg
Use another human and open another UOB One,btohqsg
So it‚Äôs a combined one right? If 30K savings  then it‚Äôs 3.85% + 0.05% or simply 3.85% already consists of 0.05%?,btohqsg
For the uob one  can I transfer the salary via FASt and then transfer out to fulfil the salary requirement And then make sure there‚Äôs e.g 50k 100k 200k to earmark before 30 sep??,btohqsg
It wasn‚Äôt credited lei‚Ä¶ shud I call the bank or just wait? It‚Äôs aug spending  so the tnc say end of each calendar month‚Ä¶ but I still haven‚Äôt see the points :(,btohqsg
make sure you Register for it.. and read through all the TNCs... especially keeping the TOTAL RELATIONSHIP BALANCE.. i think a few people will forget that and then get disqualified.https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/128891,btohqsg
Oh I read alr  they compare to june2023. So if I am a new acc holder  as long as have the earmarked amount should be correct right? Just that I not sure if I can transfer the ‚Äú pay‚Äù portion out,btohqsg
you can transfer the pay out.. as long as you keep to the UOB One locked balance amount and total uob relationship balance,btohqsg
Wait till next week n check Krisflyer account.Is the name of your Krisflyer account exactly same as your bank account name? Did you provide your Krisflyer number to bank ?,btohqsg
Do you want to see your Available Balance 0 or $1 feel more at ease?,btohqsg
For uob one  if we credited salary to the account and transfer out the next day...will it be counted?,btohqsg
Or have to keep that amount until end of the month,btohqsg
you do this games long enough.. you will understand why people like to keep $1 or $10 in their accounts for the next round.. instead of $0,btohqsg
Just like why people say apply SSB 1 day in advance but still have people like to apply SSB at 8pm on the last day.,btohqsg
Anyone can help on this? ü•≤,btohqsg
i think people are not replying because it is really dangerousRestaurants in hotels could either code as:1. 58122. 58143. Hotel4. Others,btohqsg
Are u using Lady Solitaire with travel + dining categories?Remember to use Kris+,btohqsg
Better to use Kris+  additional 9mpd.,btohqsg

I gotta pay via the link  but thanks for this!,btohqsg
eh u ask them can just pay deposit or what or notKris+ 9mpd... is even more than your lady 6mpd,btohqsg
Can tell them you prefer to pay at the counter if you want the 9mpd?,btohqsg
Hahaha  cause I‚Äôm not going. I‚Äôm paying on behalf üòÖ. But as long as can cap for UOB ladies very good Liao,btohqsg
eh actually for Lime  is there credit card promos like 1 for 1 or 25% discount etc...so those are better than using Kris+ (assuming cannot stack?),btohqsg
That is 9mpd. Make a trip to Lim if the amount is big.ü§£. 9+6 = 15mpd wow‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.,btohqsg
When travelling in australia  whats the best way to pay for stuff such as in restaurants? Cause i see paying by credit card incurs around 2% fees,btohqsg
somehow Lime sounds very familar i thought i read some card or bank has 50% promo leh..,btohqsg
I remember I saw somebody ask this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúOversea spend‚Äù to search chat history related to this query to see what other reply.,btohqsg
good news is Australia generally has rather 'accurate' MCCs compared to Japan or Korea.You could try using Amaze with a general spend card like Citi Rewards Mastercard  observe what the tagging is in Amaze app  then use a more suitable mastercard if any.,btohqsg
Maybe can stack GHA discount and Kris+,btohqsg
Ah yes I knew I saw it somewhere.,btohqsg
eh i looking at GHA app now.. i see GINGER only?,btohqsg
