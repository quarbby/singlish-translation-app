Is 70mai A800s better to change from x5?Currently  using iroad x5,btohqsg
Wondering if it's better  but it's cheaper I think lol,btohqsg
iRoad is quite good alr  why u wanna change?,btohqsg
i kena hit and run once before  iRoad captured his face and his plate very clearly ahhaha,btohqsg
Will announce the winners tmr! - J,btohqsg
Ah okay  do you mind sharing if u have battery for it?,btohqsg
Have to get the iroad parking battery?,btohqsg
i just let it run on car battery,btohqsg
didn't buy the power pack. felt it was too expensive for a battery,btohqsg
Ah okay  does it really affect the car battery alot?,btohqsg
depends on ur car and battery u buy i guess,btohqsg
just that my car will pop out message battery discharge. varies from car to car honestly,btohqsg
cus my prev car doesnt pop out such message,btohqsg
only downside is u prolly change car battery quicker? maybe others last 2 years urs 1.5 years?,btohqsg
but please invest in 24hour parking monitoring.. cannot let hit and run idiots get away with such heinous crimes..,btohqsg
Yeah man... That's why trying to get it soon during this 11.11,btohqsg
Pls buy good car battery too :),btohqsg
Prob getting the iroad battery pack,btohqsg

I choose one of course nice hehe - E,btohqsg
But would it be a maintenance nightmare tho,btohqsg
But still I would get the car ASAP it looks like its in stunning condition,btohqsg
Only if got money lol 😭,btohqsg
I would prefer another 2 seater 🤫,btohqsg
I dont think so on this. The Air-cooled Porsches are too bad actually.,btohqsg
@Xipengadvise golf too. Gee the car is good. I got one with 138bhp  omg..good man,btohqsg
Fun to drive no doubt  pure joy,btohqsg
U advise me not to get sirrocco. Lots of maintenance issues,btohqsg
Having owned both... and pretty much all the pq35. The scirocco is the much better handling car. Sadly most are shagged to high hell  so its hard to find a decent example.,btohqsg
Maintenance wise... similar tbh. Just that the window actuator tends to fail on the rocs.,btohqsg
Likely trashed also. same fear when browsing for EG6. Sure trashed at some point of time.,btohqsg
So I start the engine  drive forward a bit,btohqsg
All enthusiast cars have been driven hard at some point or another. Its part of owning such vehicles. Most importantly is that chassis is straight   previous owner didnt cut corners on maintenance and preventative measures/maintenance were done. To me that is more important than a low owner count.,btohqsg
My golf only 51 k  lady driver. Mounting koyak i changed cost me 750,btohqsg

ya.. once owned it and loved it. 1 tank can reach 800 km  and can poke here and there also..😝,btohqsg
Ah I think xipeng suggest buy gti,btohqsg
No money I bot a 1.4 with 138 bhp,btohqsg
cos he once owned GTI before...,btohqsg
MK6 or 7? MK7 doesn't have intercooler..,btohqsg
Can la. No money drive Toyota. Have money drive lexus,btohqsg
Rline is nice come with digital cluster,btohqsg
Then the Toyota turns out to be Yaris GR,btohqsg
My golf only left 12 months,btohqsg
don't know why a lot of people hate vw.. quite a good car to me.. I love it..,btohqsg
Associated with Bengs bah  like Civic EG6 EK4 of yesteryears,btohqsg
where to see this from?is this a normal occurance? to have $1 COE 45mins before closing?,btohqsg
I used to have workshops sending the engine blocks to me to rebore the 1.4l to 2.0l. So the car is no more original 1.4l too many modifications by owners. So I stock to my Golf.,btohqsg
