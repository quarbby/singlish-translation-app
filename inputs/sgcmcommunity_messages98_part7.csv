Yeah I get that. So let’s say you have a 2l car. How do you determine if it’s cat b or e,btohqsg
depends on what was used for the first COE,btohqsg
vicom dyno for heavy vehicles... for passenger car how accurate is it?,btohqsg
So if I choose cat b and then I wanna renew it after 10 years what will it be?And I as the buyer have the right ti choose b or e?,btohqsg
I suggest down tune and get Cat A,btohqsg
"""If your vehicle was registered using Category E COE  you must renew its COE under the vehicle’s corresponding category A to D. """,btohqsg
you cannot use Cat E for renewal,btohqsg
but why would you want Cat E anyway,btohqsg
it is almost always more expensive compared to Cat B,btohqsg
as it usually caters to overflow bidding from Cat B bidders  speculators and PIs with high value stock,btohqsg
Why remove… $5000 leh… I want,btohqsg
When u renew u don’t have to bid so why would u take cat e,btohqsg
I can send u the contact hahaha,btohqsg

Hey guys  would appreciate some guidance here. Newer car with lower depre is generally better than an older car with higher depre right? Same model and assuming condition is the same. Anything else that I should br looking out for? The only con of the newer car is highest cost and hence higher downpayment,btohqsg
Depre has nothing to do with how good a car is,btohqsg
