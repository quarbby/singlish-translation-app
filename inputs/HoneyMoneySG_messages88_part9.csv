Hello all  for hsbc ega  does anyone know id its possible to get the 1% cashback for giro payments to AIA?,btohqsg
Hi everyone  noted that we wont earn rewards for retail txn if we pair this dbs card to amaze.. How about uob lady solitaire card? If we choose travel & dining category for uob lady linked to amaze  still can earn 6mpd  right? I want to use for dining overseas and to offset the exchange rate fee üôÇ tq,btohqsg
Anyways  for the Kris flyer UOB debit card  does the app share how many miles I've accumulated from my spending?,btohqsg

Hi  can I check before credit card cancellation is there a minimum no. of months a credit card must be maintained after sign up?,btohqsg
Usually 6mo/1y if you collected sign up bonus.,btohqsg
I didn't collect any sign up bonus. So should be able to cancel anytime if there are no dues  right?,btohqsg
You can check the tnc to see if they will charge you early cancellation fee.,btohqsg
I did that with my UOB when i cancelled after a few days. They told me no penalty cuz i didn't receive any sign up bonus.Check with CS for their bank they should let you know if there's anything to watch out for.,btohqsg
Hi everyone any idea to earn miles/points/cashback paying credit card bills? Thanks,btohqsg

HSBC EGA account have 1% cashback for paying credit card bills by eGiro,btohqsg
You can look into HSBC EGA  paying with GIRO gets you 1% cashback on your CC/other bills. With exception of HSBC cards and self initiated GIRO transfers (non-fast).,btohqsg
Hi all  can i earn cashback from Citi Cashback card for buying NTUC vouchers?Previously i bought using CRMC + amaze and the mcc is 5411. But im not sure whether 4mpd was awarded.,btohqsg
Does anyone know if OCBC can pay CC bill manually? Like UOB. TY,btohqsg
Hi all  for ocbc 360 giro salary crediting.Once the salary is in  i can immediately transfer our rite?It will still be recognised?,btohqsg
Have not received HSBC EGA 1% cashback since 24 Jan. Anyone have the same issue?,btohqsg
As long you don't setup GIRO I think can manually pay?,btohqsg
quick (and probably dumb question) lets say I wanna pay my Citi (which is the Billing Organization  BO) cards via GIRO using HSBC EGA  I need to get and fill the forms from Citi then submit it to Citi for them to process it  correct?,btohqsg
Yes correct. Unless the BO have eGIRO.,btohqsg
ah thanks!1) currently except for BOC and ICBC  all other banks do not support eGIRO for CC payments right?2) eGIRO qualifies for EGA's 1% cashback?,btohqsg
eGIRO application is basically same as form but less steps.. because you still will go through BO side to submit,btohqsg
lots of people have the same issue,btohqsg
Trust bank introducing Trust+  with new metal card incoming. ü§î Still need to be union member for 3% p.a.,btohqsg
Also can‚Äôt see any difference previously. To get that 3%  we still need to be NTUC members spend credit card 5 times and maintain 100k?,btohqsg
"I think it's just like their ""cool club""... For metal card  vip support  extra privi..",btohqsg
Any data point on how long it takes for the spin to come in,btohqsg
But one thing I like about it is good holding account until you decide where you want to move or invest your money. Reasonable interest returns and no need to worry maintaining balance with a large holding area of 500k to play with,btohqsg
Just asking  are we allowed to share referral code on this platform?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúShare referral code‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
I found this website is quite useful. The website also proposes a list of best credit cards to use. You can try to search using either merchant name or mcc code.https://heymax.ai,btohqsg
Ah thx i think it‚Äôs not allowed,btohqsg
