Usually we change all tgt. If one dies means the other also lifespan shorten,btohqsg
I usually recommend change sparks and ignition coil tgt,btohqsg
I changed only when faulty  depends long left,btohqsg
That’s why i buy only short term cars n repeat. No need change so much. Just change the spoilt part with 2nd hand,btohqsg
But bro u think about it  when u get the car new  u have 4 coils when one dies  it means the other 3 went thru same mileage. If one give way means other 3 give way  if u replace 1 by 1  ur paying 4x the labour cost. Dont penny wise pound foolish,btohqsg
Ur ignition coil eg 45 bucks and u need 4. U replace 1 by 1  its 180 bucks with labour maybe 30 each time. Become 180+120=300 job.If u one shot do its only 180+30=210,btohqsg
Got some parts if interlinked might as well one shot  eg water pump and thermostat. Change one shunbian change the other. Save $$. Initial cost is higher but long runwise u save on labour.,btohqsg
Bro ur mentality more suitable to buy short term car,btohqsg
U may even get away with it by not changing n drive till scrap,btohqsg
Bro ur mentality more suitable to not own a car,btohqsg
