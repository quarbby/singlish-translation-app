💎Pika World Update 11 February 2022💎Equity markets fell after releasing the latest inflation result that shows a growing trend of price increases across the board. It unfolds deeper as one Fed official conveyed that the interest rate increase will have to be probably faster and more significant.🧨Consumer Price Index🥊Yearly compared to last January  CPI rose 7.5%  above the expectation of 7.2%  a further acceleration from 7% in December. In addition  the core CPI  which tend to remove the more volatile food and energy prices  jumped 6%  slightly above the consensus of 5.9%.Of course  market participants are not looking for such a figure as we are exploring the possibility of a peak and inflexion point.💵The bond market spoke🛎The 2-year Treasury yield reflects more rate hikes as it rose to 1.63% from 1.36% a moment before the inflation result was released. On the other hand  the 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 2.06% from 1.93%  as expected.The move is consistent with the funds futures market  which often predicts the coming interest rate movement. Now  investors expect a 96% chance that the Fed will lift the rate by 0.50% in March  double the usual 0.25% rate. This is up from just 24% possibility on Wednesday.The odds are rising after St Louis Fed President Bullard commented that he would love to see the benchmark lending rate hitting 1% by July. Unfortunately  this news caused a widespread sell-off in the market and dented the market's upward movement.As discussed  it is perhaps time to go on lighter touch as the market digests yet another tough inflation read.It is 11 February  Friday  8.05 am in Singapore and 8.05 pm in New York.It is the end of the week  and Pika World wishes all a safe and enjoyable weekend ahead.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
