Telco is 4814. Utilities can be4900/9399. When T&C excludes â€˜utilitiesâ€™ without stating MCC  does it exclude Telco spending as well?,btohqsg
New user I also never git this issues before when I just join before,btohqsg
utilities is 4900. Utilities excluded just means 4900 excluded  nothing to do with telco,btohqsg
Hi Chris I recall your partner is also a PR mentioned in one of your earlier videos.Just to check if the premium of 10k for a SC/PR couple  will the grant be able to pay off it also? Or it will be automatically added in the HDB price?,btohqsg
Hi all  does using Amex TCB to top up net flash pay card  via net app earn the cashback (3%/1.5%)?,btohqsg
Not excluded so should be yes. NETS app accepts Amex?,btohqsg
Add on 10k to hdb price,btohqsg
According to website  yes  but with $0.5 fee,btohqsg
So you need to top up at least $33.33 for the cashback to start offsetting the fee,btohqsg
If 3%  will be faster to breakeven,btohqsg
Not sure how it reduce cost and staffing compared to paynow as a digital banking payment for example.Also paynow do not have a fall below fee at least for singaporean not sure about others.Does it work like cryptocurrency to encrpt coding? If not  Paynow from 5 years ago is already operating digitally  digital i banking.So im not aure whats the big difference unless Central banks from different country hook up or cahoot together for international digital banking and now giving out coupons and discounts and miles etc to attract people to use new CBDC Central Banking Digital Currency for a One World Currency and a One World Government Agenda for more power and absolute full control with no laws or regulation governing them.,btohqsg
i think you missing the point of digital bank purpose as a bank that exist fully digital which and you can have a full banking service without the need of a physical bank.as you are comparing paynow which is a payment method or using crypto currecy to fight against SWIFT or similar.Digital Bank not equal to creating new payment method but is the new way we bank.Digital Bank is create to serve a different group of audience who will never need to go down to a bank to do stuffs and preferred everything to be done on their phones. Getting fully banking services on their phone.How it different from traditional bank ? Traditional bank still need operate physical branch which incure more cost in operation hence why there is so many stupid fees in traditonal banking.But digital bank can cut down alot of those cost and past down to users.Like Trust Bank give higher interest rate in their SA with a base of 1.5% and a close to Google SPOT FX rate without any FCY fees.No fall below fees. These are unheard of in traditional bank like (DBS OCBC UOB)These are the benefits of digital banks AKA save cost and past down to users.,btohqsg
Hsbc staff told me I can open Ega even if I have cc already and still be eligible for singsaver promo but have to open it physically at their branch and theyâ€™ll manually inform singsaver,btohqsg
I was told the opposite by the staff that I won't be eligible for singsaver cause I have a cc ðŸ˜‘ that's why never apply,btohqsg
Yes  I don't think you are eligible for the singsaver promo as you already have the cc.,btohqsg
am i right to say now HSBC EGA bonus promo entitles one to 4.3% pa interest rate on top of its prevailing IR of 0.05%pa?,btohqsg

Question: using CRWC + amaze at dental clinics will get any reward points?,btohqsg
Private dental should be able to get,btohqsg
Works for UOB PPV. Got 4mpd from it. Iâ€™d assume it works for CRWC + Amaze as well so long as itâ€™s not public healthcare,btohqsg

I am still on the fence to fully embrace DIgital bank after reading this article:https://milelion.com/2022/10/24/trust-bank-when-digital-banking-goes-awol/,btohqsg
it not for full switch  you still have your main traditional bank but more towards like smaller saving accounts or like GXS idea of saving pockets,btohqsg
Yes that's what I do now,btohqsg
Does anyone know if sc simply cash card got any cashback for public transport?,btohqsg
U r on the fence because of which reason? In my case I had a smooth experience with Trust bank so far.,btohqsg
the reason that is mentioned in the article.. I never experienced it myself.. My experinec with trust bank is also smooth so far.. but I won't put a big sum to the account,btohqsg
I supposed 6-10months cash flow should be ok. The rest ppl usually consider other investment tools.,btohqsg
The FairPrice voucher works. Been using it for a year already,btohqsg
Can consider this EGA account.HSBC promo giving 4.3% on top ups,btohqsg
Yes.. or even just for monthly cashflow.. Previously I was thought of putting few months emergency fund.. but knowing there are better saving account  Trust acct has very little plus point,btohqsg
Hmm trust bank suit a group of ppl like FairPrice group visitors spending around $400. Plus the promotion is still good for now. Canâ€™t say it is very attractive but 8-9% for non fpg I think is acceptable especially we look at total spent $750 which is ok i think. It pairs up well with other main cards strategy. Eg 8-9% if I visit dentist is ok,btohqsg
Trust bank can use to pay AXS? Got rebate/cashback?,btohqsg
However those on giant and Cold Storage then no need to consider the card of cos.,btohqsg
Yeah depends on personal spending profile. I don't do groceries.,btohqsg
Yup then is easy to decide for u,btohqsg
I think digital bank in Singapore is definetely safe.. What I am trying to highlight is that due to the lack pf physical branch  when you have issues on access to your digital account  it will take time to solve.. You rely soley on phone call or chat..,btohqsg
Especially now fdigital bank is still new  there will be teething issues on operational wise..,btohqsg
