Ok if you feelIncorrect then it’s incorrect to you. Because I know it applies to almost all people,btohqsg
So take it what what you will,btohqsg
interesting to see how your behaviour devolves when theres nothing left to argue,btohqsg
once again: you  absolutely cannot drive a malaysian car in singapore whether true sinkie or PR is a clear objective statement not subject to interpretation,btohqsg
Your behavior is the one. You’re pointing out a very minor situation.,btohqsg
you did not say almost all people. or most people. or some people. you even said absolutely,btohqsg
If you want to be so specific and detailed then ok you get what you wanted b,btohqsg
you had no idea such LTA permits existed until i mentioned it didnt you,btohqsg
so why not just say ok i didnt know?,btohqsg
Please don’t be stupid in correcting my English. You’re trying to find fault with people who write English?,btohqsg
i think this has gone on long enough. i trust reasonable people to assess your behaviour appropriately,btohqsg
Yes. Stop this please. Move on.,btohqsg
You’ve stated your point to show lawyerly way of saying.,btohqsg

Hello  i am planning to buy my 1st car  any suggestion? Probably looking for cheap COE car for first time  what do i need to look out for?,btohqsg
the best time to buy a car is during restriction period,btohqsg
now depreciation even for COE car is very high,btohqsg
What are u looking out for in the car?,btohqsg
What will be ur usage like,btohqsg
Nothing special just make sure i can go frok point a to b. So not need a fancy car. As long the car is in good condition.,btohqsg
Probably will buy second hand car for now. Until i feel comfortable before spending more.. ahaha.. maybe fit or swift,btohqsg
Fit is a good idea. Can consider Vios or Axio very save fuel =D,btohqsg
fit is my preferred car  agile  easy to drive  and park  good fc  cheap to maintain,btohqsg
you should test drive a fit and a vios  for me fit is the obvious choice,btohqsg
Fit can be a good camper cause of the interior seats flexibility as well,btohqsg

My friend selling Jazz  left 3 years. Let me know if you are keen.Parf car  only 60 k km,btohqsg
Wa very under utilized good deal if can get =D,btohqsg
he never say how much yet how u know good deal,btohqsg
Let's try and guess how much the price will be,btohqsg
buy a used one. a good used one,btohqsg
As in the car only move 60k milleage for a 7yrs car.,btohqsg
COE IS250  2009 onwards model. very good looking and totally bulletproof,btohqsg
buy a used mazda 6 or 3 great to drive and reliable,btohqsg
Owner could be expecting a high price also since he/she feels mileage is Low,btohqsg
having said that i think its fair that a car with such low mileage at that age ask for a little more than market rate,btohqsg
the peace of mind is quite worthwhile,btohqsg
Depends on how the car was maintained also,btohqsg
Not very worth in SG context i believe. Knowing that after that u need to renew COE for another how much and the car isnt even new ><,btohqsg
yeah for sure. but all things constant  lower mileage is better,btohqsg
my own observation (opinion only  not fact) is that those i know who dont drive often tend to take better care of their cars. They over-service the cars relative to mileage and their interiors are much less worn out. so to me  lower mileage is a really good sign,btohqsg
Same recommendation… but I drive mazda  so im pro mazda,btohqsg
buy used cars can trust the mileage 1?,btohqsg
you can cross check with servicing records from agent if there are any,btohqsg
unless got official servicing receipt since day 1 noting the mileage.. otherwise just take it its not real better,btohqsg
yeah if direct seller gt keep best,btohqsg
single owner with full service record and low mileage. i happily pay 10-20% over market price for this kind of car,btohqsg
Different people uses car for different purposes.Workhorses are usually not taken care of.,btohqsg
yup and the workhorses are the ones with the high mileage,btohqsg
sorry  dont mean to offend anyone,btohqsg
left 1 year COE still not that bad.,btohqsg
would have to be really cheap i guess,btohqsg
Sharing is caring. Opinions and Thoughts are welcomed =D,btohqsg
yea. My experience with Toyota workhorses are that if minimally maintained  engine can last longer than the power windows,btohqsg
These cars have very high depre!,btohqsg
oh yea yesterday big rain. Saw one mazda (i believe I saw PTE HIRE label) with spare tires on front right side.Damn dangerous. I will never take that ride,btohqsg
i know a good friend of mine. i promise you i am not joking. he bought a new toyota vios i thin in 2008. he just drove it from new and NEVER SERVICED IT. he never changed the oil. the car lasted 80 000 EIGHTY THOUSAND KM before it blew. You know what the repair bill was? 2k plus. i joked to him that he actually saved money not changing the oil for about 3-4 years and just repairing the blown engine,btohqsg
"left 1 year... its the ""spoil but replace now not worth"" period",btohqsg
so dun wanna repair. sell car lo hahahaha,btohqsg
yup. Car can move can liao,btohqsg
When people buy 2nd hand car. Even when the SE says the car already did check and all inspections. Will U guys still go ahead and change the Spark Plugs Etc?,btohqsg
depends. If you are willing to spend  go ahead of change the spark plugs. The don't cost much.,btohqsg
btw@SGCM_Admindo you guys still feature community cars?As in cars from members here.,btohqsg
I changed all oils too. Engine oil  brake fluid  transmission oil  power steering oil and engine coolant. 😁😁,btohqsg
your mechanic will know best i think. when buying the car you should bring it to him for a full check/service asap,btohqsg
i buy 1 yr car so dont have this headache. i tink its ok ba  drive until the next servicing den check lo,btohqsg
"It's up to individual. For me  I want a ""fresh"" start. 😁",btohqsg
Probably for those few yrs car left lol,btohqsg
I did that when I got my first ride. Cos there is not much records on the previous oil change. Don't risk just do especially when I wanted my car to live long.,btohqsg
Go NEW hahahah EV lah no need change alot of things hahahaha,btohqsg
Did my own engine oil change. Workshop changed transmission fluid. Brake checks are ok. Pass LTA inspections also.,btohqsg
1.5LRFS: upgraded.Personal car  not dealerV well maintained.,btohqsg
Thank Bro  but i think the price will be a bit at the higher end  planning to find those left 2 years or less then will see if driving is something i really need... lol...,btohqsg
Once u start u never stop HAHAHAH,btohqsg
For dealer commision  how much usually i would need to fork out? 200-400?,btohqsg
Got heart one dun need pay such shit lol,btohqsg
Selling price is slightly above $40k. Fully paid. Can transfer anytime. Viewing at panjang during weekdays.Highly recommend for someone looking for a hassle-free ride.,btohqsg
Some dealer demand 1k.Seriously  since it's not urgent. Slowly find  chat more even with dealer. You will get the hang of the market,btohqsg
Hi mind if u leave the chat if this is a SCAM?,btohqsg
not gonna risk it. banned the fella,btohqsg
Yes thats the plan. Any good dealer or agent to recommend?,btohqsg

Always assume the mileage is tampered until verified with the servicing record.,btohqsg
I just test drive at 2 weeks ago,btohqsg

Yeah. But most common would be prius vezel and mz3,btohqsg

i am bmw driver and i bought a used mazda 6 2016 and it's fantastic i dirve it daily. i dont drive the bmw anymore except once a week,btohqsg
i bought mazda in january 2022. and in 3 months i am so happy with it,btohqsg
it is dubbed japanese bmw. really enjoyable car.,btohqsg
quality is also very good. love it,btohqsg
U are not the first one who I heard comparing mazda to conti cars and praising it,btohqsg
that fuel economy is liek toyota vios for a mazda 6 2.5,btohqsg
Conti cars are popular for it torque and power   or those luxury version like an s class or 7 series,btohqsg
If compare to like 218 or cla 180   some Japanese cars are really better or way better,btohqsg
218 got a immediate failure from me,btohqsg
When I wanted to upgrade my mz3,btohqsg
Most of the conti on the road are coe car or entry level like such   so perception is generally wrong,btohqsg
wish it had more power though but overall great luxury\,btohqsg
Power come at fc   might as well get ev,btohqsg
Low power   poor interior    poor insulation   cramp,btohqsg
Compare to it signature version like 535 and such,btohqsg
And coming from a sedan  218 is a diesel mpv… the drive sucks,btohqsg
Not only drive sucks   it is so noisy i thought the engine is breaking down when acceleration,btohqsg
I don’t want to pay money just for badge,btohqsg
Actually entry level u see the 2nd car market can be lower then jap car haha,btohqsg
Hahahah i sat in a Audi Coupe before LOL. Not bad,btohqsg
Some are just for brand …,btohqsg
I drove a cheapo version Kia koup,btohqsg
Actually a lot of people are not aware that they can't pump 95 on foreign cars?A quick fix is basically any foreign cars pump 95  just charge at 97 ron price lor,btohqsg
Las time I pump at jb u  u need to inform the cashier then can pump  so defiantly they just trying to bypass intentionally,btohqsg
Could be that over the 2 years  got used to pumping ownself at kiosk,btohqsg
i think its mostly intentional. there was a big paper pasted on the pump saying singapore cars cannot pump 95,btohqsg
The petrol kiosk ppl see sg plate won’t allow u pump95,btohqsg
but im talking about before covid  not sure about now,btohqsg
back then people pumping 95 was rampant. every pump had a paper pasted  but most people ignored it. and because so many cars are pumping . no one enforced the rules,btohqsg
The jacking up the car to get extra drip of petrol is very jia lat,btohqsg
Actually goverment also know la u see the 3/4 tank rules really got enforce Meh,btohqsg
But these pplToo greedy and thick skin   by pass 3/4 rules   pump 95,btohqsg
When 1 day Malaysia also fed up then no more benefit,btohqsg
But I have to confess la  I wasn't aware foreigners cannot pump 95. After reading  it make sense. Malaysia subsidize the fuel for Malaysians who really need fuel as a means of transportation. Malaysians do not enjoy the vast public transport network Singaporeans have Most other countries tax on fuel. Only Malaysia subsidise fuel for their Malaysians who need as a meant to live.So yea  Singaporeans should not be basket to go pump 95 in Malaysia. It is shameful.,btohqsg
frankly i think the policy decision to restrict some grades of petrol based on car nationality is one of the stupidest ones i have ever seen. They expect the people collecting money to enforce the rules which is ridiculous. Then you couple that with heck care sinkies and this is what you get,btohqsg
Kia is actually quite 👍 especially the just 10 year old ones on 6 speed,btohqsg
There is a reason why Malaysia's RON95 is significantly cheaper than RON97,btohqsg
similar to SG imposing 3/4 Tank Rule. By right it should be against the guidelines to International law of Monpolising the petrol,btohqsg
i'm not sure about this honestly. The way i see it singapore soil  singapore law applies,btohqsg
Thats why we drove on the left sided of the road. 🤣,btohqsg
they can make whatever nonsense rule they want and apply it to you as long as you're here,btohqsg
Why would 1 country wanna impose a 3/4tank rule,btohqsg
in fact you can even take drugs overseas and get charged here,btohqsg
U see this in any other country?,btohqsg
All fuels in Singapore are taxed. Just like your tobacco.,btohqsg
OK so they are taxed so ?,btohqsg
why u think cannot carry msia cigarette in,btohqsg
so they want their money. not saying i agree with it  i dont. but thats why it is like this,btohqsg
U can when u pay tax at custom,btohqsg
tax money recieved  do what you want,btohqsg
Actually sometimes I wonder why these ppl so thick skin and risk it   now social media so powerful ppl keep take photo and post   just for that few $ worth it Meh,btohqsg
i used to smoke last time  and paid tax on cigarettes when bringing in from overseas. you do save a bit of money doing this  but not a huge amount,btohqsg
Now SGRV really expanded to Malaysia. 🤣Gan,btohqsg
I was wrong then. I know aussie have crazy taxes on tobacco and fuel.,btohqsg
So u mean we come back pay Tax of $0.80/L x Ur Full Tank ?,btohqsg
tobacco yes but fuel there not as bad as us here  last i checked,btohqsg
Like that i am sure no body will drive into MSIA hahahahaha cfm,btohqsg
i think if there was an easy way for them to verify  they would probably allow it,btohqsg
I may have mistaken new zealand for aussie for fuel part. PSPS,btohqsg
the problem is how do you enforce?,btohqsg
No need to think. Our Gov wants what will come out with what. We dint agree but in the Parliament its all approved LOL cause opposition is not enough to overpower,btohqsg
yep they do what they want,btohqsg
and its always centered on squeezing you dry  regardless of the policy,btohqsg
they should just have an additional charge for foreigners pumping  but it's malayasia..,btohqsg
when you approach their policy with the mindset that they are trying to take as much money away from you as possible  everything makes sense,btohqsg
I would say  when it comes to money business  Singapore have a pretty robust implementation of rules. Which leads us joking about the Big Singapore Cooperate company. 3/4 tank might also be a response to Malaysia on tackling SGian go Malaysia pump.,btohqsg
This won't work because of black market.,btohqsg
this is my speculation: it was a pushback from local petrol companies who lost sales and the govt losing thier petrol tax revenue that resulted in the 3/4 rule,btohqsg
Yes I got nothing against them   but o do hope they get fine by Malaysian authorities,btohqsg
Such act is too greedy and Abusive liao,btohqsg
I think there is a rule to prohibit pple…. If nobody is enforcing  u are free to join them:),btohqsg
Now with the social media presence very easy to get caught   and is online shaming plus fine,btohqsg
Ya exactly but some pple dun care so let it be lor:)),btohqsg
Nothing is Perfect….they just see Malaysia 🇲🇾 plate and of course it’s presumed that mostly are Malaysians,btohqsg
AiyaGo Singaporeans go Malaysia drive Malaysia plate cars. A lot of issues can be solved.,btohqsg
The issue is we want to save money for cars used in Sg,btohqsg
then why buy car in the first place if you cannot affordd?,btohqsg
Is about regulation and law   and personal ethic,btohqsg
singaporeans are masters at buying cars they cannot afford,btohqsg
Is not cannot afford   just want to save….if got chance to do so….,btohqsg
Yea. it is the same group of people who bought cars but cannot afford parking.,btohqsg
those that rush or tailgate thru barriers.,btohqsg
remember the good old days 10 years loan zero downpayment,btohqsg
I just want to relive the moment of cheaper COE..... and fuel price in SG 🥲,btohqsg
This part I can’t say lah…. I personally dun pump 95 cos 97 already cheap so dun squeeze untilLike this lor,btohqsg
Who don’t want to save money ? But doing thing against the law is not a proper way,btohqsg
yea la. This should be the minimum. Those that pump 95 is...just pushing the limits,btohqsg
Anyway their 97 is more like our 95 so….,btohqsg
These are the most despicable ones,btohqsg
And some are like the more expensive cars,btohqsg
I also dun get those pumping and shaking the car LOL,btohqsg
uniquely singapore. i dont rmb any other countries' citizens shake the car like that.,btohqsg
Kiasu mah and maybe wishful thinking.,btohqsg
Like as if can add 10L more,btohqsg
I am only taught to move abit and brake while the petrol can go into the tank but not shaking like that HAAHHAHAHA,btohqsg
overfill kills the car too. evap system will kaboom.,btohqsg
Idk about us using only 97 too,btohqsg
There are just risk takers out there:),btohqsg
when evap sys kaboom  whatever shake u have saved will one time hit you hard for repair,btohqsg
Ya actually shaking the car and such a really dumb   u don’t go back and pump below 10% most of the time   and why u need to Shake  when it give you 1% more   which it doesn’t,btohqsg
Next time go eat buffet. Remember to shake your body after eating first round. then proceed to start 2nd round so can eat more food. 😂,btohqsg
No… go buffet… half time  need to clear bowels  then go back continue,btohqsg

It’s safe. A few times I go in abs they don’t bother to check,btohqsg
If caught fined $100 worth taking the risk to test,btohqsg
Can pass? Like abit lower than 3/4,btohqsg
just got messaged from my family member driving across  he saw ICA checking petrol levels so please be safe,btohqsg
there are very few cars crossing  its very easy for them to stop and check you to get their KPIs up now while traffic is light,btohqsg
wise choice of caption picture 😂,btohqsg
Do not go during midnight. That’s where checking takes place always,btohqsg
Just when i thou ppls won't shake their car when pump in sg. This fellow hold up the cars behind waiting for him to shake his toyota raize. The poor pump attendant lady still help to shake his car also.🤦‍♂️🤣,btohqsg
Reason why we cant have good stuff or nice things,btohqsg
Just pump in sg. 🤷‍♂️ i like our spc ambience,btohqsg
Its their decision to pump 95. They get caught  then so be it. Regardless what sinkies pump  bottomline  sinkies still spending a lot whenever we are there.,btohqsg
But you said its the reason we cant have good stuffs or nice things?,btohqsg
Does it matter? 🌊🏩 will reject your $$?,btohqsg
Saw another article that Najib complained about Singaporeans pumping 95 petrol  which is heavily subsidized for Malaysians.I find that it is a valid reason for not allowing Singaporeans to pump 95.Imagine if u are a corporate and giving out free food to low income employees… yet senior employees try to get a share of it,btohqsg
Malaysia has one of the lowest fuel costs in the world,btohqsg
But its costing them alot by subsidizing 95 to their people really salute them,btohqsg
Did you know a perodua smallest 850 cc car roadtax only rm20 a year,btohqsg
And a 2 liter engine car is only rm328,btohqsg
U need to respect their laws just like you expect visitors to respect ours when they are in (SG). Basic manners lah nothing to be salty about,btohqsg
Yes… just like we won’t want their citizens to come here and get gst vouchers which the govt allocates for low income Singaporeans,btohqsg
So basically this article is trying to say?,btohqsg
I feel its a different thing Going to msia pump petrol is a everyday thing while them working here getting a PR status or etc is different. In a way Hmmm,btohqsg
Don't expect fuel subsidy from Govt,btohqsg
Yah precisely they beat around the bush trying to explain their ground in de end is No Subsidy LOL,btohqsg
I can hear Minister Chan Chun Sing saying:Mai Sia Suay la,btohqsg
It's a no ending situation the moment they agree to have subsidy.. we would then be expecting more everytime something bad happens also..,btohqsg
True also lah. So lets take it if no Tax means per L of 95 is at $2.20,btohqsg
Go Malaysia pump 95 lor 😂😂...,btohqsg
tax subsidies have cost. The money has to come from somewhere. expecting fuel subsidies means to balance the budget  the shortfall needs to be made up somewhere else. so this could mean another 1% on gst  or higher income or property tax. Does this sound fair? IMO i dont think so. I am personally against any form of fuel subsidy in singapore because for us  the car owners are more likely have higher levels of wealth or income,btohqsg
super interesting. nearly 1 billion a year in tax revenue from fuel for the government. Imagine if gets cut by half...how much GST would need to go up to make up the shortfall,btohqsg

does the auto brake turn on whenever engine start,btohqsg
Depends on model and make  and can even be aftermarket flashed.If you brake to a stop like a traffic light  does the civic hold thebrake? Do you need to tap the accelerator to move off?,btohqsg
oh actually yeah I reversed until it lock. (if by locking you mean like releasing the brake and the car isnt moving)but then the car is still abit infront of the lot,btohqsg
that one I don't really notice because I always put my leg on the brake pedal,btohqsg
Carpark lots are like that. No real rule to how long it must be. A vios will usually fit with space  but a civic slightly longer. If u notice mb s class or higher end cars etc will usually not fit fully. Just take a look next time you are in a carpark  most cars are not fully inside the lot. In fact most drivers will back up all the way to the rear kerb  then go in neutral/drive to move forward a bit  1 of 2 cm  so the rear tyres aren't pressed up to relieve the pressure.,btohqsg
ohhh I see   because the car is the only one sticking out and this isn't my car so I don't want anything to happen 😂,btohqsg
Look at the Mazda 6 vs jazz length for example. Np.,btohqsg
actually isit possible for companies to modify the reverse safety collision system? because the car has a body kit so is that a plausible reason why my car didn't went all the way in to damage the bumper?,btohqsg
That why stock is best haha,btohqsg
every time when u are changing new car  you will apperciate how much money you had save  if the car is stock hehe,btohqsg
Stock and also cheaper than other similar range LOL,btohqsg
sometime the more u mod  the slower then car get hehe,btohqsg
Depends what u mod? If u keep on putting weight LOL then yeah lo,btohqsg

How much road tax and insurance to pay,btohqsg
Given this is a 4L V8. Per Yr also maybe 3k plus? LOL Insurance dk lol,btohqsg
2.3 k at most ba for insurance at most throw in name driver only,btohqsg
See age lol 2.3k u mean 25YO or ?,btohqsg
My wife with 1 year driving experience driving a 506 horse car is also 2.3 k insurance,btohqsg
Axa I heard next year no longer Offer insurance,btohqsg
i'm guessing its not brand new?,btohqsg
Forget liao 3 month ago wife go get   but is only name driver   so valet also can’t,btohqsg
good reminder to always check the insurance policy wording,btohqsg
Sob the road tax is xiong,btohqsg
anyway for insurance  many factors will influence the premium. driver stats aside  power output aside  i think the biggest one is the actual market value of the car  which of course depreciates over time. so you could get a relatively 'high risk' car having decent premiums if its aged a bit  since it will have a lower market value as an insurance payout,btohqsg
If owner can afford the car  🙃,btohqsg
I go back to Tamiya or Tomica ><,btohqsg
best  not affected by fuel prices 🤣,btohqsg
Young and experience is the top factor..,btohqsg
Yah but cannot go Point a to B hahahahah,btohqsg
Only a certain cars i like? HAHAHAHAH,btohqsg
I just got the Fairlady Z model lol.. 370z i think,btohqsg
I see. I keep the type r,btohqsg
Ya bank loan also is 1.2%,btohqsg
If bang still use new parts?,btohqsg
Total loss usually means ... insurance will see if u can be reimbursed by time of loss,btohqsg
and if u still have loan u have to deal with it with no car with u so dun total loss,btohqsg
In a way i have asked insurance before abt stolen car etc .. how insurance claim. (For Comprehensive only),btohqsg
Total Loss does not mean u dun pay the left over is how much u are covered at time of loss. So if u have outstanding loan and it does not cover u still pay even without a car. Sad to say.,btohqsg
Yes … the loan and the insurance payout is distinct,btohqsg
So those cars who is confiscated….:),btohqsg
Confiscated cars insurance happy HAHAHAHAHAHAH just pay outstanding LOL BYES,btohqsg
Happy ah? I dun think so lah cos one car less to collect premiums,btohqsg
The guy will get another car then buy from them again LOL,btohqsg
Yes and they are stream lining the non life part or the other way round:),btohqsg
AXA Singapore sold to HSBC..HSBC not continuing the vehicle insurance so now no more new biz  existing policy will run off (lapse) so no renewal for policyholders,btohqsg
I use axa for the past 10 year,btohqsg
Good thing come to an end,btohqsg
They suffer big losses over the years.. HSBC sacred this portfolio burn their base,btohqsg
Not surprise as u see how ppl claim insurance   a 30 k omv car accident repair can hit 6 digit   might as change car haha,btohqsg
Actually is the Injuries & Death claims that is crazy especially if breach of policies..By law insurers have to pay third party Injuries then recover from policyholder but u think policyholder will pay?,btohqsg
Car if deemed total loss still can recover from the vehicle shell,btohqsg
Policyholder die  recover from who lol.. estate also won't want to settle,btohqsg
It's also the driver's mentality.. ever heard of 1 case whereby this insured kept claiming then of cos premium affected his reply isn't that wat insurance supposed to do be doing.. pay my claims but cannot increase my premium,btohqsg
Blur me… I thought the office was at kaki bukit… but it was directly opposite my dad’s place,btohqsg
Self entitled ppl a lot like such haha,btohqsg

was there any colouring or material stuck to the bottom of the suction cup?,btohqsg
Not that I know of  I transfer from old ride to new ride though.,btohqsg
Use the tiger and put over it,btohqsg
it looks to me like either that suction cup transferred some material from your previous ride or removed some from your dash. if so that would mean you're pretty screwed,btohqsg
Actually cars insurance in spore is minimum risk..if car total lost  there is still coe & parf value which can be recovered thus not total loss..also spore is small n rules are strict.. cars cant disappear overnight like in Africa so total loss is a rare.. companies should b making decent $ if not for scams n fraudulent claims..,btohqsg
you can try those dashboard restorer fluids they sell on aliexpress or autobacs as a last resort but test the product on a small hidden part of your dashboard first,btohqsg
Issue is the maintenance of these chargers.. mostly might b damaged or vandalized if not under close watch etc.. still have to monitor.. then different ev cars different chargers how ? Headache,btohqsg
Hmmm i mean if lost in msia or sth 😂,btohqsg
Hahaha the Audi and the fit ah,btohqsg

current bid only 33 for 1600cc,btohqsg
c who are the idiotic dealers bid up,btohqsg
Go ev go use the 45 k rebate and Chiong,btohqsg
Im guessing Cat B and E will cross the $100k mark🤭 what about you?,btohqsg
calm be4 the storm in next bidding,btohqsg
Time to flex 100 k coe again,btohqsg
suzuki showrrom ask me want to bid or not,btohqsg
Me too! I’m guessing in the range of $102-104k,btohqsg
This is a flex that I would give a hard pass😰,btohqsg
There an article waiting that we can hit 200 k coe by 2030,btohqsg
If you can find the article  do share it here!,btohqsg
Can play The Price is Right? If you guess closest to the premium at closing you will receive petrol vouchers OR a free car of your choice if sgcarmart is feeling generous 🤪,btohqsg
Actually that one idea. We can plan for one in the future. We're working on another interesting giveaway at the moment. Will release details by end of the week!,btohqsg
Can read for fun   but is possible,btohqsg
It an old article in year 2016https://www.torque.com.sg/all-articles/the-200000-question/,btohqsg
And now borders open ! Buy car now go jb pump !,btohqsg
“Earn” back the money spent on paying for a high COE premium🤣,btohqsg
Yes ! 1 week go twice settle all problem   don’t have to shake car also,btohqsg
The car that need 12 hours to update over the air,btohqsg
But if you buy an EV instead  different story liao🤭,btohqsg
I am driving an ev but I go there pump tyre also,btohqsg
What's the figure like for your ride with the rebate,btohqsg
45 k rebate off purchase price lol,btohqsg
EV should have their own COE cat,btohqsg
I think this suggestion must feedback to LTA leh😆,btohqsg
but with the current plans on phasing out ICE vehicles  a special COE cat for EVs will not be feasible🙁,btohqsg
If u buy an ev now u enjoy 45 k cash rebate   u buy ice is pay $15 k onwards more tax   price difference is $60 k   thanks ice car buyer for funding ev cars,btohqsg
So if coe is at 100 k with the 60 k difference   ev car owner is like just paying 40 k coe and ice car owner is paying 100 k coe,btohqsg
That why now ice car buyer are rich ppl,btohqsg
Yes yet ppl in most article will said goverment not helping in promoting ev  the 60 k difference is already so big   where as car omv is on average 30 k,btohqsg
Is it the tax Much higher?,btohqsg
No unless u buy performance 1,btohqsg
Then should be better to buy EV right? Less maintenance too,btohqsg
The battery 🔋 price will come down exponentially,btohqsg
The petrol u save is easily more then the road tax for like a mg that is a around 1k plus yearly,btohqsg
yes. a BYD e6 road tax is nearly twice of similar power ICE cars,btohqsg
Hmmm sian lah COE so high now ... but every 10yrs trend,btohqsg
ev need another 20-30 more years to be mainstream,btohqsg
By then i think I drive the Paper Car alraedy ><,btohqsg
so much rebate.. ev still pricey.. who earns? haha,btohqsg
Car price is expensive in Singapore is becuase of Pepe,btohqsg
Actually why ah? Last time diesel high is cos they pollute the air right?,btohqsg
The petrol thet can’t tax you,btohqsg
rebate all already counted in lah haha,btohqsg
next month they announce 100k rebate  but ev price go up. in the end same. still more costly than ice,btohqsg
The road tax of like $1000 more a year is nothing to petrol saving,btohqsg
went to test MGZS  good car. 140k,btohqsg
diesel higher road tax based on pollution taxelectric higher road tax based on power rating,btohqsg
ya lo all the AD take nia rebates,btohqsg
Ya 140 k can buy what ice car now haha,btohqsg
Want save money choose ev battery is all 8 years factory warrently,btohqsg
exactly haha. and unless u live landed with charger  or hengheng ur hdb mscp got charger. if not wont be practical also,btohqsg
U drive a mg eletric then compare to Mazda 3. I sure u will never want drive Mazda 3 again,btohqsg
you asked for ice car right,btohqsg
and also to account for loss of fuel income,btohqsg
As announced at Budget 2020  the road tax framework for all new electric vehicles (EVs) registered from 1 January 2021 has been reviewed to better reflect current trends in vehicular efficiency and to partly account for fuel excise duties which EVs do not incur  until we are ready to impose a distance-based tax[1].https://www.lta.gov.sg/content/ltagov/en/newsroom/2020/3/news-releases/Supporting_electric_vehicle_owners_in_the_transition.html,btohqsg
So in SG now which EV is most Affordable and Reliable? Hmmm,btohqsg
Ya now ev is Best Buy   no sense in even buying ice now,btohqsg
Got MG EV dun want   want to buy Mazda 3?,btohqsg
Ice lover will tell u Mazda 3 better,btohqsg
Eletric car is confirm way better to drive in sg,btohqsg
280km means every 4 days need find charger haha. if workplace/home have den ok,btohqsg
you asked for ice car right,btohqsg
U should go test drive your self,btohqsg
where do you chare EV in hdb,btohqsg
how many ppl here workplace got charger lol,btohqsg
I agree how many workplace have eV charger,btohqsg
my friend have so he bought  i dun have so stay ICE haha,btohqsg
even if they stop selling ice coe  easy enough just use 'mild hybrid',btohqsg
ice wont die one  ev wont be mainstream for another 30 years,btohqsg
U are rich to maintain an ice car by then,btohqsg
Apt of company stop producing ice car from 2030,btohqsg
dun keep push 1 type ICE or ev la haha  but this is true. go test drive will be amazed,btohqsg
what is the happiness level of tesla 3 so far? are they  happy,btohqsg
One day we will run out of fuel LOL,btohqsg
Yes but feel every 1 around u too slow,btohqsg
remove the plastic wheel cover. happier lolol,btohqsg
Looks happy but also i think people are selling Model 3 already LOL,btohqsg
Did u look at tesla resale price compared to new,btohqsg
Nobody believe that Kodak and Fuji film no more Liao,btohqsg
It like buying a new car due to no ad margin,btohqsg
I went to see nearby  got 1-2 public payavale la within 3-5km for most housing,btohqsg
i like any car that is nice and performs well,btohqsg
But cant use apple carplay on Teslas right,btohqsg
200k ev vs 100k ice.u topup petrol 27 years still cheaper,btohqsg
is test drive free on tesla,btohqsg
Free. But you need to get a slot first.,btohqsg
So hard to get. I registered for one in 2 months alr still never even call me back.,btohqsg
Try the performance 1 and floor,btohqsg
There no long range in sg,btohqsg
in england  hot. all sold out. cant get even second hand,btohqsg
too heavy is bad. very bad,btohqsg
Oh so the lighter the better?,btohqsg
U try to drive the awd model first,btohqsg
Hahahahah Later i go down tell them U RUBBISH HAHAHAHA,btohqsg
i would say up to 1.8 ton,btohqsg
more than that is a drag.,btohqsg
IT is. no range. porsche is late in EV and not good in EV at all. EV is battery tech and software.,btohqsg
serious. it is sort of like iphone. whereas germans are good at traditional mechnanical engineering stuff.,btohqsg
Model s also   I ask them why never bring in model s to show case in sg they said high demand no stock,btohqsg
that is why they try to catch up. closest i thik is VWE,btohqsg
Vw update is a joke and on ice platform,btohqsg
Tesla is years ahead of nearest competition.,btohqsg
And richer then all the car company combine,btohqsg
or you can add more battyeries to increasde range right? but super heavy. not practical. you got to seek a balance. EV  forget porsche or germans or japanese. they are way behind,btohqsg
Porsche EV better or Model 3 better?,btohqsg
Hahahahah i tot jap is way ahead in tech,btohqsg
tesla of course. decent good range. porsche taycan even slower than model s plaid,btohqsg
japanese refused to accept changes. and many germans too. because it means they would have to abandon ICE and switch  a decison that is hard to do,btohqsg
Porsche is compare to model s not model 3,btohqsg
building a car is easy. building the software and battery around it to scale up is the hard part,btohqsg
But Tesla in Sg price is High Hahahaha,btohqsg
what car in sg price not high hahaha,btohqsg
tesla is now so good in UK it is not possible to order it with decent delivery. and even the used ones are selling for profits,btohqsg
SKY High If wanna adopt EV,btohqsg
A lot of country same   it is so over demand,btohqsg
Model y so high demand Singapore launch keep delay,btohqsg
tesla only focused on EV. others are still battling dealership model and ICE,btohqsg
once more people adopt government also gonna increase electricity price cuz fuel tax less,btohqsg
Dealership now dragging those car company down,btohqsg
in the end no difference one,btohqsg
but not ez for govt to increase price,btohqsg
Model Y should be more expensive than Model 3,btohqsg
cuz gotta be same as home charging,btohqsg
unless u living landed property with ur own charging point now  honestly get hybrid better,btohqsg
and ford is now doing away i feel. they created a separate unit EV and slowly moves sway fromd ealership. think about it  how else can you increrat margins than to do completely away from dealership.,btohqsg
many traditonal way of selling is done and they are trapped. if tesla margin is good and they can sell lower price forcing those ICE brands makers to change,btohqsg
in malaysia  EV is completely tax free.,btohqsg
meaning you can import one from UK and pay NO tax,btohqsg
even if they sell 10k come to singapore also become 100k hahahha,btohqsg
tes la 3 is at rm280k malaysia. no tax no road tax also,btohqsg
I heard stay landed wanna install wall charger need LTA approval,btohqsg
PUA PEH HAHAHAHAHAHHA damn but their charging worst lol,btohqsg
yes. because it is 3-phase charging,btohqsg
malaysia has some charging points meant for tesla,btohqsg
i know of a bmw tech advisor who tested tesla 3 and he sayd it is simply magnificent.,btohqsg
no ice csar can feel like it. low cg. instant acceleration,btohqsg
No competition la haha like in Singapore i4 selling at 317 k when tesla model 3 performance at 270 k   lol tesla omv is higher   everything is better in spec and tech,btohqsg
bmw lousy la. expensive maintenance i am fed up,btohqsg
buy EV that has strong good software like tesla. not just a car that runs on ebattery. that many companies can do,btohqsg
I last time drive bm   go test drive mode 3 performance  then never look at my bm again so slow in compare haha,btohqsg
Did you see Eqc engine HAah,btohqsg
yes ugly same look no style interiror always same boring looks. i dont even want to buy another bmw,btohqsg
Bm is fast   high torque that why ppl said they don’t need signal,btohqsg
Is a ice platform even got transmission tunnel lol,btohqsg
i have a m3 and i dont even want to drive it often,btohqsg
Just a 335 u are faster then most car on the road and can take their lane easily,btohqsg
fast at the expense of reliability and expensive maintenace i dont buy this,btohqsg
335 is no simple car bro lol.,btohqsg
But with ev 335 becomeVery slow,btohqsg
Wah you don’t want drive M3  let me drive leh!😆,btohqsg
Yea prefer Japanese tech. Like the fk8r,btohqsg
Practical low running cost. Fun and everyday can use,btohqsg
I already changed 3 sensors that cost me a lot of money.,btohqsg
I heard about this before  drinks 98 as though it is an NSF doing water parade. True?,btohqsg
Only 6 in a liter when I blast,btohqsg
i am sure u can afford m3 u can run it lah hahaha,btohqsg
But it’s great for long distance GT. Like going to penang. 250 is easy,btohqsg
That (!) is forget to release handbrake or what? 🤣,btohqsg
Eh boss ah  wanna check if your editorial still features cars from the community?,btohqsg
can i join the queue dont waste the car COE alr paid,btohqsg
well  M3 still definitely more worth than AE86 at that price point 🤣,btohqsg
a lot of contis IMO are overprice in the name of being conti when at the country of origin they are cars made for the mass. VAGs are fine examples,btohqsg
but they are not performing at the price that they are being sold,btohqsg
Later just before ending perhaps last half hr or so  will shoot skywards,btohqsg
Hi@skylar313  I don’t think that’s us leh. We have only featured cars from the community in 2 Youtube videos:1.Tesla Model 3 feat. @Tesla Astronaut2.Honda Civic Type R EK9 (Featuring Speed Kaki Reviews)Are these the features that you are referring to?,btohqsg

My modest e30 feels just like the more powerful m3. Balance braking handling. Same.,btohqsg
He is not… he is rich beyond xx,btohqsg
Turbo engines can’t make sound like that.,btohqsg
V8 sound best   turbo is like pop pop pop,btohqsg
I blast it on NS easily 220 to 260,btohqsg
Lexus lc500 and Ferrari also sound great in Thier v8,btohqsg
I am trying to install it in my car but Singapore no boom box feature for us,btohqsg
Often I see Mercedes’ challenging me,btohqsg
But came across a yellow Urus. Super fast,btohqsg
These 2 are the trouble maker usually,btohqsg
What can you try to install to,btohqsg
The main difference between German cars and Japanese  lie in touring. Euro cars great at touring.,btohqsg
You got to use it longer to make you smile,btohqsg
Yup a45 is fast Maserati is surprisingly very slow   a lot of noise but car not moving,btohqsg
