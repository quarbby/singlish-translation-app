2ND working day of the month  which is tmr,btohqsg
Actually about cardup it doesn‚Äôt seemed that cardup website update the nerf timely right? I‚Äôm trying to search for the visa nerf but don‚Äôt manage to find it.,btohqsg
There has got to be some source or data points for OP to say that Cardup has been nerfed  otherwise it's just fear-mongering. Visa nerf has be reversed  hence you don't find any news on the website.,btohqsg
Whatever you see on CardUp's website is still valid.,btohqsg
Can share your source of this nerf info?,btohqsg
Typical Singaporean la. Spread fake news then ask for source cannot produce,btohqsg
Sorry my bad could be the opposite.https://milelion.com/2024/06/20/cardup-offering-discounted-1-5-2-fee-for-ocbc-credit-cards/,btohqsg
Don't have that amount.Any other options?,btohqsg
does anyone know if i set up monthly GIRO for voluntary top up to parents‚Äô CPF RA  will it be eligible for 1% HSBC Everyday+?,btohqsg

self-initiated giro excluded. IRAS initiates the giro bill payment but not cpf,btohqsg

Any idea whats the best miles card for luxury item (watches  bags) 4k- 5k above? Since cant use amaze + uob KF anymore. Even if i use UOB PPV + CRMC to pay part of the bill  ill still need other cards for day to day expenses. Thanks!,btohqsg
If spend 0 on fcy and 2k on sgd contactless  ull still get the max 8k miles? Thanks ppl will go explore amex plat card too,btohqsg
Might be able to. You can try and report back here. Cuz it's eGIRO  setup through CPF and HSBC  and not transfer through GIRO.No harm to try if you already plan to top-up monthly. Or at most cancel if it doesn't work.,btohqsg
Sorry I laugh because I always asked myself the same question. However I tend to do it a bit differently. If my intention is to give back to the society then why should I bother about tax refund. It is good to have but should never be my aim. Having said that it would be perfect if can achieve both. Most importantly I don't earn so much though so my impact ain't so big. Kudos to you to give so much back to the society.,btohqsg

hi wanna check i have UOB One Card and Citi Rewards card which should i use for booking hotel from Agoda? checked on heymax it recommend UOB One  but if i book with citi rewards linked to amaze card i will get 4mpd right?,btohqsg
Did you read tnc for Citi rewards that they don‚Äôt give bonus points for travel related expenses?,btohqsg
Amaze doesn‚Äôt change the mcc of the transaction  with or without amaze it‚Äôs still a travel related transaction and will be excluded from earning bonus.,btohqsg
oo but i saw that it is not in the exclusion list  checked MCC code too its not in the exclusion list.,btohqsg
It is not in the list of mcc which qualifies for bonus points. So other mcc won‚Äôt get bonus points right?,btohqsg
But if you are fine with $1 = 1 point which is a bit wasteful,btohqsg
icic so it still can get points just not the 10x. thanks all!,btohqsg
