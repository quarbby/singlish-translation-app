Still possible or not ? I don‚Äôt dare to touch sitting on paper loss,btohqsg
Then buy small to minimize risk lo,btohqsg
Not asking you to all-in also,btohqsg
Profit exceed 2021 so dividend payout will likely exceed also.,btohqsg
I reckon Moya debt levels are quite alright actually if you compare them to the bigger water players SIIC And China Everbright,btohqsg
Moya (55%) Gearing as compared to SIIC (118%) and CEB (83%),btohqsg
I think they will only have a big move if the AAJ can have some agreements with PAM.,btohqsg
Water play really not for the fast players....all counters China or Indo operations all so low PEs.,btohqsg
Lhn resting on the moving average   looks like going up,btohqsg

"As Housing Market Boom Drags On  Just 13% Of Gen Z Say Owning A Home Is ""Extremely Important""https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/housing-market-boom-drags-just-13-gen-z-say-owning-home-extremely-important",btohqsg
‚ÄòStill  only the wealthiest Millennials and Gen Z who have parents to help them pay their down payments can really afford a home‚Äô.From the articleüëÜüèªüëÜüèªI feel why can‚Äôt they buy HDB flat with HDB loan? Just requires 10% down payment. There are lots of hdb grant to assist.. a couple work for 3-5 years with using CPF and HDB grant can easily get a BTO 4-5 room flat. Unless the Gen Z they mentioned here all are wanna be and only looking at private housing as their first home.,btohqsg
Because taking a loan comes with the expectation that you are able to consistently generate income,btohqsg
Fall sick? Market crash ? Lose job ?,btohqsg
Ironically  it's only the rich that can take loans as they are already financially stable,btohqsg
I don't mind ah. I bbfa   no need care about starting family,btohqsg
Let's look at a modest resale.. anyhow pick a few locations 3 room,btohqsg
Let's say average 350k SGD resale,btohqsg
315k left.. no way anyone just starting out can pay that in  3-5 years lol,btohqsg
Pap got help abit. See how much u can get from them depending on ur income level.,btohqsg
All these grant hv to be ‚Äúreturned‚Äù with interest when you sell ur hdb ?! Correct ?,btohqsg
The grant will be disburse to your cpf and then u use it to offset your purchase.So naturally it will have to go back to your cpf with accrued interest when u sell ur flat.,btohqsg
Can try 3rm Tengah  higher chance,btohqsg
Single best option is stick with parents and keep farming. Buy condo rent out etc,btohqsg
I remember seeing in a telegram group. For singles   how to draw down their asset when they hit a certain age becos they have no kid to pass down their legacy.,btohqsg
Why must pay in 3-5 years? No one who takes any housing loan target to pay back so soon lah. Often even before loan fully paid up already property sold to upgrade unless one chase n buy property at unsustainable  high price lor,btohqsg
If they are working sure have income..,btohqsg
So good? BTO also got grants now? Is free money,btohqsg
Yes. Bto got up to 80k grant to get from govt.,btohqsg
Have to be realistic. Even when housing was cheaper in the past  most young buyers below 30 will not be able to pay in 3-5 years. Usually only people near retirement age have shorter loan repayments period. Banks not willing to loan them above retirement age  anyway.,btohqsg
I can get the grant too ü•∞,btohqsg
4rm at Boon tiong rd. sneakily also hit 1m. No news coverage on this. üòÇ,btohqsg
I also never get any grant before,btohqsg
93 years and 1 million... Lol,btohqsg
My side Circuit Road the last time I saw new 4Room TOP 2015 resale 1001 sqft cost S$ 830 000.,btohqsg
Is it bro  I had binance . Didn‚Äôt know about it,btohqsg
Tampines newly MOP 5 room resale also hit $790k,btohqsg
