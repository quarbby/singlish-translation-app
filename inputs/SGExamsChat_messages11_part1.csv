Question:Putting aside the practical implications of re-modelling the existing facilities to accommodate to female cadets  what good reasons are there that women don't have to fork out 2 years of their lives to serve the nation?,btohqsg
I'm genuinely curious  not here to force my opinion,btohqsg
I’ll try to think of a response,btohqsg
Imma be honest i don't think there are any,btohqsg
My current stance is that it's more of society'spotentially patriarchalperspective of women rather than any actual good reasons  on why women don't have to serve NS,btohqsg
I have thought about this for most of my sec and jc life LOL,btohqsg
I strongly agree! Can't rly think of stuff rn so i agree w this,btohqsg
ya i ask my teacher  they roll their eyes,btohqsg
Long story short(not short) Compare 2 lives1. You have the stereotypical PSC scholar  'studied very hard' 90rp  can't do much CCA cuz no $(so no music)  maybe Librarian Vice Pres. Assuming he indicates interest in certain areas of SAF  he will enter a different world which is only accepting of people who area. generally paid highlyb. accountable to few people  but in the same manner  should be highly accountable to themc. accepts no moral failings  and certainly not the kind involving moneyThe environment is shaped by these systematic requirements.2. Stereotypical NS boiboi. Normal life. Went through BMT mono. Considering that 'discipline' is important  safety rules are thrown out the window. The lesson is simple: don't die  don't get caught doing stuff not to be done.How can these two people ever meet?,btohqsg
I’ll just give my own response ah haha,btohqsg
I thought Dynkin was gonna respond to me  I got nervous,btohqsg
The super important and practical implication of changing any part of NS as it is. Have you seen NS numbers? Tell me which ruling political party in their right mind would change a policy in support by up to 90%+ of the population,btohqsg
That's the political perspective I suppose,btohqsg
In SG  it won't be that much lower than number 1,btohqsg
actly i feel this is damn valid,btohqsg
Let her foreves be lazy HAHAHA,btohqsg
"PAP preaches the ""we want to do what's right  not what is popular"" when doing things like raising taxes or building casinos  but I guess they're not internally inconsistent when it comes to policies that are more impactful and polarizing (377A and women in NS) I suppose",btohqsg
I've not seen high support of NS for women in polls anyway. The highest numbers IIRC re women is when they are not necessarily going combat  and go into stuff like nursing/healthcare.But actually still a lot of practical problems to handle with hat,btohqsg
Preach all it wants. It is a political party.,btohqsg
"It's not valid  it's basically saying ""there is no good reason except for the fact that women will resist the policy change and PAP will lose supporters""",btohqsg
Valid but not right of course,btohqsg
Political support should not be the only thing holding the party back from making such a decision,btohqsg
This is why anarchy is the best/s,btohqsg
Then again i am simultaneously for and against NS,btohqsg
> raising taxesYa  and tell me how to support the poor without revenue? They already doing the NIRF or whatever GIC framework alr  so they are tapping onto many many revenue streams> building casinosholy shit 2% of GDP - which rich man is going to give 2%? 2% of GDP means jobs  buildings  schools  AIRCON,btohqsg
Even if somewhat 'unpopular' these obvious (somewhat) economic policies will gain PAP more votes in the long run,btohqsg
A fair point is also the fact that a much larger % of women won't get very good PES with the current system  so the system may need to be tweaked quite a bit to suite that. Training will definitely need to be different if ippt standards for women change too,btohqsg
Someone asked me throw leather in water,btohqsg
Everyone gets nervous when they think Dunkin is typing to them,btohqsg
??? PES is wrt to PULHEEMS. Not sure how different it currently is. Either way all soldiers should be able to NIGERUNDAYO cuz apparently that's a lifeskill according to movies. But honestly many jobs don't require that apex machine of a man who can deca-ironman.,btohqsg
"My ""magnus opus"" against that point is: a huge part of war is not about the combat itself  it's about strategy  managing supply lines and communications etc.  and women who lack the physical prowness can easily fill up these positions",btohqsg
omg ur hair is so bleached wow,btohqsg
PULHEEMS is diff for men and women? Or what,btohqsg
not what i was going for but yes,btohqsg
I like him though  I always learn something when he responds to me,btohqsg
The problem with strategy is that it's a problem of people. Who's going to decide strategy?*insert lines from a few good men here*,btohqsg
PES is based on medical conditions rather than physical fitness though,btohqsg
IDK man  this one far too back in memory lane. If you asked me 'back in my day' I might know.,btohqsg
Oh i always thought that ippt stuff and the whole test besides that also affects,btohqsg
??? ok smokey  imma pull out my big boi run,btohqsg
Did they do another weird video ...,btohqsg
I mean there’s already women signing on,btohqsg
It’s not like there isn’t an existing system in place to deal with including women in NS,btohqsg
Women are only allowed to sign on for combat iirc,btohqsg
by that logic id be a pes f,btohqsg
Why would you sign on for clerk anyway,btohqsg
If your pes isnt high enough then they dont allow you or strongly urge you not to,btohqsg
"What happens when I throw an elephant into a black hole.""wait  what black hole? Is it a Kerr black hole?""""I don't know! Let's try first! :D""",btohqsg
Because I love my nation and I want to serve it/s,btohqsg
They had one on that concept,btohqsg
