Hi all May I ask if donations via OCBC 365 is considered as part of the minimum $800 transaction?I think I rmb reading somewhere it won't be included as any part of the cashback..,btohqsg
Check MCC code  then ask OCBC. If the MCC is billed as retail  it is still considered.,btohqsg
Any form of spend which u are not confident if it qualifies  jus make a small spend then check ur credit card statement if got MCC code. If dun hv  jus call the CS up to check the code.U can verify with CS directly else check against the terms and conditions which should indicate the list of MCC codes which do not qualify,btohqsg

Have anyone bought travel insurance from DirectAsia before? Is it recommended?,btohqsg
they're just keeping it alive to milk those users who aren't up to date with the news I guess  if not there's no reason not to just axe it,btohqsg
yea  i only use Grab now in Malaysia  Thailand and Vietnam cause its cheap,btohqsg
Not too sure if this will help but I'm personally considering msig,btohqsg
Any particular reason out of so many other providers?Just trying to find smth as cheap as possible  didn't have much to consider since I have other insurance plans already. But definitely don't mind paying slightly more for a good and useful plan.,btohqsg
I think I was looking mainly at bigger brands then just feel the coverage for the amount there suits me bah..main concern is on reputation so in case something happens  won't (hopefully) be problematic in claims.That said I never really looked extensively everywhere la  so DYOR tooüòÖ,btohqsg
In my opinion  travel insurance plans are so opaque it is very difficult to compare which insurer has a more beneficial plan compared to another. My recommendation is to focus narrowly on a few commonly claimed features that you think you really need  and do a like for like comparison between 2 to 3 insurers  then just choose the cheapest.,btohqsg
MSIG is definitely a premium insurer  it is more expensive.,btohqsg
Thanks William   appreciate it and will reconsider,btohqsg
When I buy insurance plans  I look at ease of claiming.  The coverage is quite similar with each tier.  I‚Äôve never had any issue with Allianz all fully claimed within 30 days with supporting documentation  legit reasons.  Then I itchy backside went to MSIG and 6 months later they still lost in translation  they have all my documentation  calling the hotline is a waste of my time.  I‚Äôve practically given up chasing them for couple hundred bucks.,btohqsg

Depends on the MCC code of the trans. If a donation trans has mcc belonging to charitable donation  nearly all credit card (including Ocbc 365). To confirm  read their TnC..Only card that I tried that can bring cashback are: Maybank Platinum Visa and ICBC Global Travel Mastercard.,btohqsg
Your CPF transactions in your CPF account(s) affect the amount of interest u would receive.Money CREDITS into your CPF accounts (e.g contributions  refund and court settlement) this month start earning interest from the next month onwards.Money DEBITS from your CPF accounts (e.g withdrawal  deductions and court settlement) in a month will loose the entire month's interest on the month of withdrawal. For instance  if party A transferred $200 000 of CPF SA to Party B on 30 Apr as part of a court proceeding settlement. Party A would loose the entire month (Apr) interest for the $200 000 (666.67 $).Personally  I do RTSU (via cash) to my parents on the last day of the month so that my money can earn some interest in my own bank account.I do not qualify for cpf withdrawal yet.Source:https://www.cpf.gov.sg/member/faq/growing-your-savings/cpf-interest-rates/how-is-my-cpf-interest-computed-and-credited-into-my-accounts,btohqsg
May I seek advice if ‚Äúpayment via shopback QR‚Äù qualifies as an online payment transaction or paywave transaction ? (Relating to DBS LiveFresh Car),btohqsg
I think you can look into HSBC Revo  they reward you in points but the conversation rate is about 2.5% cashback + 1% for EGA.secured credit card requires you to put 10k with them as fixed deposit and EGA account to maintain is 2k.if you have any questions you can pm me in regards to this  since I've experience w their secured card facilities (student w no income requirements),btohqsg
I have all the 3 cards you mention  personally I think I would prefer to use Revolut or Trust  since for Youtrip you can't withdraw the money out.For Trust they have some stamp reward system  so even on overseas spend if you hit the requirement you can get the stamps.For Revolut there is no such things  so if you want rewards  you can consider Trust. For FX rates wise sometimes Revolut is better  sometimes Trust is better. Just take note that on weekends Revolut has a 1% charge.,btohqsg
thanks man  will look into that,btohqsg
Yes  will be in my video today,btohqsg
Thank u. Looking forward to your video,btohqsg

Does anybody know for the $228 signup promo for OCBC Titanium Rewards  spending of $500 within 30 days. Must it be for only MCC entitled to the 10x? Or even for MCC that are eligible for 1x (e.g. dining  groceries)  is still eligible for the $500 accumulation?,btohqsg
