I thought it had no annual fee? Or am i missing something,btohqsg
With ocbc titanium nerf  what is a good card for electronic spending above 2k?,btohqsg
uob kf if at kris plus merchant  otherwise spilt paymennt using paywave for uob vs  uob ppv. online use smrt citi,btohqsg
if online dbs wwmc 4mpd for max $2k  citi smrt 5%  amaze+uob kf cc or Kris+ uob kf cc (3mpd unlimited)  for offline combine uob visa signature (max $2k paywave) and uob ppv (max $1.11k mobile contactless)  hsbc revolution ($1k paywave)  Amaze+crmc ($1k).,btohqsg
amaze+kf uob can also be offline txn too for unlimited 3mpd I think?,btohqsg
only certain mcc count under online shopping for uob krisflyer,btohqsg
Xnap + uob one visa count towards cashback and one account interest?,btohqsg
should be if merchant mcc not excluded  the normal hawker xnap should be ok,btohqsg
Any idea if wwmc used with Atome is eligible for the 4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi friends  im new to the credit card scene.If I intend to apply for UOB One credit card just to use it solely for SP Services bill that amounts to around $700 per month  would that work and qualify for the min spend?,btohqsg
That one is ofc assuming it's under the mcc hahahaha cos the person was asking about electronics,btohqsg
Electronics not under uob krisflyer mcc for online shopping i think,btohqsg
Uob krisflyer online shopping mainly refer to fashion website,btohqsg
It is listed on website that stated it include fashion website as online shopping but not exact mcc stated in tnc. So spend at your own discretion. Plus the bonus point only come in after 1 year which is after annual fee and i have very bad experience with this card and annual fee cant be waive,btohqsg
Hey gurus  I am holding the citi rewards card  uob one  and uob solitaire lady card. For paying of big purchases like furniture's and paying of bills/income tax/insurances. What is the best option here on which card to use. Do I need to get a separate card for that?,btohqsg
Do you guys think it is wise to only have 1 CC? Currently using hsbc revolution miles card.Or should I have another cashback card?I recently got a huge pay bump but i do not forsee inflating my lifestyle,btohqsg
do u not have spending that dun get bonus points on the hsbc revolution?,btohqsg
Having more cc’s doesn’t lead to lifestyle inflation. Lack of self control does.,btohqsg
Currently im just using almost everything on it for the sake of it,btohqsg
I think its time to optimize..Worried i cannot hit the minimum spendings,btohqsg
If you’re using it for almost everything  high chance some of them don’t qualify for 10X.,btohqsg
Then yes  even a dumb 1.5% cashback card is better than 1X points. Your lifestyle doesn’t need to inflate  your headache might trying to remember which card to use though .😂,btohqsg
Cmrc amaze would be good w revolution,btohqsg
Revol covers the travel part and cmrc amaze almost anything other than travel spends,btohqsg
I'll need to go back to the drawing block and find out the merchants etc.What is 'cmrc'?,btohqsg
you mean CRMC? citi rewards mc,btohqsg
Yess pair with amaze for almost any transaction. Hsbc to supplement it,btohqsg
cheers  i gotta read up on this pairing thing,btohqsg
Just link cmrc to amaze in app and use amaze card. Anyway revo and cmrc no min spend just have cap at 1k for bonus points,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGI am thinking of redeeming 30k Sept SSB  keep in CIMB 3.5% till end Dec  then put in Jan SSB (3.39% forecast). This comparison is against DecSSB bcos JanSSB graph not available yet. Could I trouble Chris or SSB experts to help check whether worthwhile thanks,btohqsg
I am primarily using UOB One for my daily expenses - solely for the purpose of getting the high interest for the 100k parked in UOB One account. Otherwise  I use Lady Card for Dining and buying air tickets and hotels booking. For spending when overseas  low cost items I use Trust Card for better exchange rates  but for big tickets items like luxury clothes bags shoes when overseas  I use UOB privilege miles. Realised that I use mostly UOB cards 😂,btohqsg
damn  that issa lotta cards hahaha. Let me start with 2 😁,btohqsg
The 365 sign up link is broken? Can't seem to access it from my phone,btohqsg
Don’t know why when overseas I use UOB privilege miles for big tickets items … may be I should just use Trust for all things overseas when paying in foreign currencies…..,btohqsg
That’s the problem when u ask the question you asked. 😂  I don’t give a shit about cashback honestly cause the amount is too immaterial. Therefore I focus on miles to help me do upgrades when I fly.,btohqsg
"I saw this comment on reddit  would this be true to any extent?""The crucial issue is  the fees for transferring your points to miles. Essentially sets you back -$26.75. I actually think a good Cashback card can completely cover your flights (long or short haul). You get the flexibility as well.""",btohqsg
Wait until he finds out that taxes and fuel levies cannot be redeemed by miles as well. 😂,btohqsg
Yes  if you spend the correct amount using the correct method  such as UoB evol or dbs live fresh  you will get $40/ mth with 600 or $800 spend,btohqsg
Yeah  but is so much hassle… i can’t track online spending or contactless spending etc. Wa Hin lo 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫,btohqsg
Yes  that’s why I shift to lady card now,btohqsg
theres so much meta to this CC game haha. I'm new so it is overwhelming,btohqsg
Is there a tool or website or app that can show history of US stocks that I want to see/monitor in term of the daily volume buy and sell? Instead of manually go to one by one stock to check,btohqsg
what is ur categoriesfor UOB Lady card ?,btohqsg
I am asking cause I think best to select those categories re. big ticket items like travel  dining and Fashion.,btohqsg
personally i think the same way too. But alot of this things really depends on your personal habit   like spending expenditure   what you spend on etc,btohqsg
Understood  I personally dont spend alot yet. Most of my transactions are from shengsiong lol,btohqsg
if your spending is like mine   300$ on online and 300$ contacless than evol  is the best,btohqsg
almost something like that tbh  I'll check evol out,btohqsg
evol cashback is 8% but the cap per month on each category is like 20$    so you can spend 250 for contacless and 350 for online   or vice versa,btohqsg
My first step is to figure out how and where im spending money,btohqsg
could use google sheets to do,btohqsg
i am  using google sheets to write down all my expenditure and put it into contacless / online . i could share it with you if  you want,btohqsg
thinking of subscribing to Wallet by BudgetBakers. used the free version years ago,btohqsg
Hey guys  Got like 300kApart from Webull  moomoo and ssb  is there any other good attractive place I can park my money for high yield? I’m okay to get out of the SDIC insurance zone - doesn’t have to be a bank.,btohqsg
Any one has opened SRS account? Any difference between the 3 banks?,btohqsg
hi experts  the UOB lady card will share the same bonus category and monthly bonus limit as the main card?,btohqsg
Any benefits to open at the end of the year?,btohqsg
Yes sup card follow principle card,btohqsg
Can I check if lady solitaire card can be linked to amaze?,btohqsg
Can I check if I link my uob lady card to amaze and use it to pay for travel which is the category I selected  will I get the 6 mpd?,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGwhat are your experiences using tiger broker vs ibkr  and which do you prefer?,btohqsg
Amaze paired with Citi Rewards Card> Amaze is setup as GrabPay Auto Topup Credit Card.With the above method  will I incur 1% transaction fee from Amaze?Will I earn Citi Rewards Points once Amaze charges expenses to my Citi Rewards Card?,btohqsg
so meaning in order to earn the Citi Rewards Point  we hv to use the Amaze Card physically?,btohqsg
I think Adam's point above is that you will not earn Citi points for topping up grab pay (even if you do it through amaze),btohqsg
I need to scan PayNow QR Code to make payment.Is there a workaround solution that i could use Citi Rewards Card in a E-Wallet and then scan for payment in order to earn 10x rewards point?,btohqsg
cant.. just tried to scan PayNow QR.. it doesnt recognize..,btohqsg
sorry. Anyone encountered rejection by SCB? Reviewed my credit rating AA but they dont say why rejected.,btohqsg
Credit score is not decision making factor. They have their own criteria.Last year my application was rejected because some info was missing or wrong (of course they won’t disclose the reason). I re-applied after 1-2 weeks and was approved.,btohqsg
If it's just pure paynow  afraid that there aren't any known solutions to really,btohqsg
Can use google pay to earn a few cents haha,btohqsg
What is the reward for OCBC infinity card? How much is the minimum spend to get the rewards?,btohqsg
Normal unlimited cashback card lor. Similar to Citi Cashback+,btohqsg
As in what’s the sign up reward,btohqsg
Iirc it's the +0.2%. If you're NTB you might want to consider signing up other OCBC card first,btohqsg
USD digital rate not so much better. I see 1.3596866  interbank now trading 1.3637Physical Money changer rate i checked today also 1.360,btohqsg
Anyone know hw many times a year you can use theCIMB World Mastercard Lounge Access?,btohqsg
If you read carefully  it says:Gain access at apreferential rateto over 1 300 airport lounges worldwide,btohqsg
That is USD32 per person per visit. 😅. No free lounge access.,btohqsg
Any idea what time does the 3 Nov SIA flight sales starts from?,btohqsg

Hi  Any good debit card to credit monthly salary with additional interest?,btohqsg

If 5k in one shot and is online  can look into Citi smrt,btohqsg
Unfortunately ocbc tr has been nerfed,btohqsg
Does NTUC membership fee counted towards UOB Evol cashback or min spend? (if we make an online payment for the annual fees),btohqsg
Hi just to get some feedback on my own c.c strategy  wld appreciate feedback/improvements on it:General Spending : UOB PRIVI (MC)Specific Spending: UOB LADY's (Travel),btohqsg
if u looking at miles card  UOB KF card is also another worthy card,btohqsg
Im getting electrical appliances in store,btohqsg
Hi WS  I was searching through the history and couldn't find the answer for NTUC membership payment  even though there were few people asked. Wonder if you have found the answer?,btohqsg
Hmmm... buy courts online? Haha. If it was last month  the answer would be ocbc tr easily. Dunno if your transaction can be split up to hit things like Citi Rewards  OCBC TR  UOB PPV/ VS,btohqsg
Whats the difference between OCBC TR last mth and this mth?,btohqsg
Hi  just wondering if using UOB lady's card for xnap  which category do i need to select to earn the miles? I read some of the history and it seems that XNAP is using 5814 (Fastfood). But that was for UOB One card. Is it the same since it is from the same bank?,btohqsg
Last time is yearly cap. Means you can one shot spend 5k and get 4mpd on that whole 5k. Now got cap  I think is 1.11k per month (?),btohqsg
electronics is removed from whitelist of ocbc tr now for 4mpd and monthly cap based on 1k spending,btohqsg
Oh yes  good point. Forgot about that  cannot use ocbc tr@Warheart606,btohqsg
So wont get any OCBC$. Or just use any unlimited cashback card,btohqsg
Yep cannot. Can ur courts transaction be broken up?,btohqsg
can pay with different card if at physical store,btohqsg
sometimes depends on the staff tbh  got hear before they dun let you (maybe too junior/ just don't want to do),btohqsg
i will just tell them i have limited credit limit on each card  take it or i take my business elsewhere,btohqsg
Even if it doesnt qualify for the ocbc$  does it still qualify for eligible spend to get the new sign up rewards?,btohqsg
it will have the based 0.4mpd and qualify for sign up reward,btohqsg
some time is it how u phrase the situation to the staff and not tell them bluntly that u want to spilt the card due to rewards. If u tell them there is credit limitation  they will allow u to spilt card. I have done it for harvey also spilt payment,btohqsg
Anyone having trouble logging into HSBC?,btohqsg
hi  I would like to ask if I am able to choose category for this quarter if I apply my uob lady's card n approve this month?,btohqsg

Hello  Can I check if there is anyone experienced of cancelling the AMEX SIA Card with negative KF? I’ve stopped using the card as I find the KF reward not as attractive as compare to other card. Are we allowed to cancelled with negative KF or can we pay off the negative KF so that to cancel the card?,btohqsg
isit hard to apply credit card if u r not employed?,btohqsg
secured cards are an option  10k-30k fixed deposit for most banks/cards,btohqsg
Any suggestion for telco plan without contact?,btohqsg
UOB is offering a promo rate of 3.1% now for 6M 10M 12M,btohqsg

Rather put into SSB or Tbills.,btohqsg

For UOB One Visa vs UOB EVOL comparisonI only used UOB One Visa for 2 months.If I don't drive and shop in ACB merchants (CS/Giant/Guardian/Shopee/MCD)  setup recurring payment to SPGroup.Do i lose out to EVOL's monthly $40 cashback?,btohqsg
Yes evol give better cashback if u can fulfill 600 per month (250 online  250 paywave  100 of any eligible trsnsaction),btohqsg

UOB One Visa cashback cap for $500 to $999 is $50 per quarter right? and it's once every 3 months?,btohqsg

I would need to pay a foreign transaction payment which is education related. Given that amaze card link will have 1% fee  what would be the other alternative that I could have to make paymentCurrently I'm thinking to topup amaze wallet via master card and paid using amaze wallet so I can earn the 0.5% cash back and also my 1% giro from credit card.Secondly would be apply SC Journey card for the rebate of the usual 3.5% FCY transaction fee.Any senpai here got any better idea?,btohqsg

Hello guys  currently at quite a loss on how to go about maximizing rewards for purchasing a macbook > $4k 😅 Given that I have Citi Rewards (and Amaze)  Cashback+  Premiermiles  HSBC Revolution  UOB Lady's Solitaire and EVOL. And assuming I can get from say iStudio (perhaps even using Atome here?)  and Shopee/Lazada  and even Apple online store. What would be the best option?,btohqsg
I also bought M Log @ 1.50  then price drop. Cry a bit then buy more 1.4x,btohqsg
U want to get any rebates or just want to pay wo the fees??,btohqsg
fcy might not be charge  only sgd transaction,btohqsg
Buy instore best. Use diff cards to swipe0. Citi amaze 1k revol 1k evol 250 rest on premier miles,btohqsg
but since education is a excluded transaction for most card  you are better off topping to amaze wallet and get better exchange rate and the 0.5 percent cashback and 1 percent giro from credit card,btohqsg
Oh possible to split payment in that way?,btohqsg
Im not expecting any rebates and dont plan to use like icardup etc. I'm just seeking any easier way to pay this off,btohqsg
dbs altitude 2 visit per year  citi premier card  2 visit per year,btohqsg
U need to ask the cashier before u pay but shld be able to split payments in store.  Online for sure cannot split unless atome 3x payment but u can't choose the amount,btohqsg
I see  that sounds like a good idea haha. Okay thank you! 😁,btohqsg
If no rebates cn just use trust bank / youtrip etc for the favourable rates ah,btohqsg
Does anyone here know if we can use cardup or ipaymy to pay for town council bills ?,btohqsg
Try to explore if you can buy it from Krisshop using UOB Lady Solitaire.If it is feasible  max rewards will be 6mpd x $3k = 18 000 miles.If Atome + HSBC Revo is acceptable  then you can get 4mpd by splitting into few months of payments with max $1k/month,btohqsg
thank you  and this will have to be under travel category right?,btohqsg
Krisshop is under travel mcc ?? According to heymax is mcc 5309. Dont think its part of uob ladies travel category,btohqsg
You can search an article “uob lady travel mcc” using google on this.,btohqsg
5309 duty free store are included under lady solitaire travel according to mileslions,btohqsg
Yup saw in the article alr. Haha then yeah mayb buy from there better. If the price is the same,btohqsg
Went to check out the Krisflyer Travel Fair at Suntec this morning. Seems a bit overhyped.Any value from it that others have seen besides the lucky draw?,btohqsg
dun worry i bought M Log @2.04 before and dca for 4years alr to current avg of 1.78 so its a long term game,btohqsg
saw trips to bkk at $215 and danang at $307,btohqsg

Wow for sure you are rich haha. Think you need assess whether buying at krisshop using uob lady solitaire earning 8-10 mpd but cap at 3k is better than buying in store and split cards each earning 4mpd. Or get UOB KF card with no cap.,btohqsg
Hihi   why is the 540 divided by the 71k ? Shouldn’t it be 540/25k miles ? Since we can just get away with spending 1k on foreign and local spending and don’t pay the annual free and just get the 23k+23k miles right ? So technically I’m buying the 25k miles for $540. Anybody can clarify ? Thanks in advance,btohqsg

Thank you both  Yu Oh and Joseph :))How about Citi cashback+?,btohqsg
If you keep calling cso  it will become no 1% in the future. The best is to ask this chat group first if you have any query.,btohqsg
u read terms and condition wrongly bah  where got say not eligible?,btohqsg

i cant find it in their t&c,btohqsg
If u dont see it excluded meam it is included,btohqsg
by included u mean can get 4mpd?,btohqsg
Grab wallet top up using some credit cards used to have cashback/miles big big on website too before  but now……🙁There are many similar examples in the past if you are long enough in this games to know this.,btohqsg
U need to tag with amaze which will incur 1 percent amaze fee but get 4 mpd from citi,btohqsg
Asking or not actually dont really matter if u ask me  it is in bank book to see if the promo work then benefit cut due to costing once they hit their accquired target,btohqsg
Just like how chocolate finance closed once target hit and gxs closed after they reach certain amt of customer,btohqsg
So enjoy while u can because once company hit their target number they shut the door.,btohqsg
oh ya. then maybe HSBC revolute paywave better,btohqsg
Hsbc revol have whitelist merchant u need to see if it is included,btohqsg
If you have time to read the chat history  you will know how the nerf story unfold. Every time people call cso  few weeks later  bank announced the nerf.,btohqsg
It is because it cost too much to bank to sustain once alot know the hack but hsbc ega have been around quite long liao. Ega stop the bonus interest for a few month and regain in nov/dec,btohqsg

Besides I’m sure every credit card product manager reads ML    should be part of the job’s market research and monitoring component 😂,btohqsg
Yeah u mean the milelion blog page right haha he put there only ocbc ntb 6 mth haha. Next day later nerf to 1 year haha,btohqsg
Alot of hack is frequently written on seth and milelions blog,btohqsg
After posted not long before it gets nerfed ...,btohqsg
Citi rewards plus amaze is a long hack liao  dont think citi dont know about it  just whether they want to nerf it or not,btohqsg
Local bank tend to be alot more stingy then international bank,btohqsg
The more the bank knows  the more the nerfs.,btohqsg
I know what you're trying to imply  but it's also funny coz it implies that the bank  who developed the product  know less than others.,btohqsg
that's not wrong  if you recall the 8mpd apple pay promotion by citibank,btohqsg
My friend got alot of miles from that promo until the bank bans him from spending on citibank card. Until now his card application with citibank keep getting rejected.,btohqsg
He got near 2 million miles from that promotion,btohqsg
that sounds hilarious. hope he at least managed to transfer all his miles out before they terminated his accounts 😂,btohqsg
This can happen especially my friend repay his card to regain limit during the promotion period. He got near 200k or more grocery voucher for his company during that promo,btohqsg
So citibank only see this crazy user buy 200k in supermarket during the promo period and thus he got ban,btohqsg
"I think my friend got contacted by citibank direct to inform they wont award him 8 mpd for any further spending due to the ""abnormal spending"" behaviour on his card",btohqsg
Do remember in bank tnc there is a clause that stated they have right to amend it anytime and if they suspect your spending is not for personal usage.,btohqsg
This is why i say bank have datapoint to see and amend the tnc along the way,btohqsg
lol  can spend finish the miles before they expire?,btohqsg
He convert it during the sia bonus 15 percent so get alot of bonus from conversion too during the covid period,btohqsg
Anyway not sure if anyone is spending regularly at nex,btohqsg

For dbs can I from POSB saving acc bank transfer to my dbs mutilper by salary is it counted? Or must other bank,btohqsg
Existing hsbc need to spend how much to get another 50 voucher?,btohqsg

So must use other ppl de bank?,btohqsg
ur own account from other bank also can,btohqsg
can do non- FAST transfer from uob website  choose salary payment from purpose dropdown list,btohqsg
Is it for the $300 cashback from Citibank for new card sign ups ?,btohqsg
Hi guys is the moneybull promo still on ? I can't find it in my promotion center,btohqsg
800 spend sounds like normal monthly min spend. Iirc NTB is 500 spend,btohqsg
Let say u already got 100k in uob One and u don't want to keeps 100k over on uob One but u still want to enjoy them bonus interest while top up $1600 monthly and spend $500 per monthNow do u go about it?Top up $1600 on starting of month and mid month drew out $1600 and spend $500 within the month and the next month u top up $1600Willl This method work inorder to enjoy the uob one bank account bonus interest?,btohqsg
What’s the bonus if i pair my amaze and uob lady solitaire versus using only lady solitaire? For example travel spend,btohqsg

Thanks. If it’s local currency  I still get 0.5 % back on Instarem points?,btohqsg

So you transfer stock purchased to cdp?,btohqsg
nope i do not transfer anything,btohqsg
Which cashback credit cards do not exclude cardup?,btohqsg
Hi all! Which UOB cards are best to use for SP & Geneco bills payment that is over $1k in total? Paying direct by the vendor apps through CC/debit will also be entitles to be $500 spending right?,btohqsg
Tiger charges an arm and a leg to transfer out anything with them.,btohqsg
Don’t do Simba  they have a 30 day minimum stay. Go with Giga instead. If you have not used Simba  might give you a shock.,btohqsg
Anyone transferred stocks out from TDA and yet to receive it?,btohqsg
Maybe becoz the reception is like sh*t????,btohqsg
I used TPG before. Really cmi,btohqsg
Btw if you cancel or transfer out of Simba in 30 days  you have to pay them 30 SGD for activation charges,btohqsg
i m thinking to subscribe Simba SuperRoam 50GB(30D) for coming vacation  then cancel it after my vacation  so i can only cancel it on the 31st day ? meaning i will need to minimally pay for 2mths of subscription ?,btohqsg
Service Port-out• An activation fee of $30 is chargeable for port-out within 30 days of plan activation.,btohqsg
if i need to pay $20x2  then not worth  forget it,btohqsg
Bad value  you can get 100GB on Singtel with just $10,btohqsg
Ah ?whcih plan hahaha i only know zym has that plan   heya or whatever. Im saying zero1 is good no contract out fee and used for porting loops,btohqsg
You can get giga for $1 currently to do porting loops,btohqsg
Oh i didnt know that   so u get new number from giga?,btohqsg

Check out the item you want from courts  then buy online using smrt card.,btohqsg
if not urgent (house a few months ready  or item can wait)Ask to arrange for split payments  assuming not some insane amount.Use cards like WWMC (if can get online payment links) or HSBC Revo + UOB PPV + UOB VS in-store mobile payment (google/apple pay).,btohqsg
Else is Kris+ with UOB KF 3mpd uncapped+ 1 mpd for audio house+ 1 mpd Harvey Norman+ 6 mpd for hipvan+ 9 mpd for Mayer,btohqsg

Not sure how to see 😅,btohqsg
But now the value is $716.68,btohqsg
But so weird  log in their website the value is 393.11 whereas the app states value at $716.68 .. confusing,btohqsg
Account value 703 is not the same as Portfolio value 393. Is there idle cash around 300 in your account that is not invested in the smart portfolio?,btohqsg
yes  for max $1k in statement month. Will incur 1% Amaze fee,btohqsg

Just used XNAP for my wet market purchases 🥰 not sure if it counted as food under lady’s card so I used uob ppv,btohqsg
cashback for one account only. Max interest for $100k average daily balance on uob one account,btohqsg
U can link to amaze then check it afterwards,btohqsg
Can I check  are we able to withdraw the excess of 100k during the earmarked period? Or should we just leave it there and not touch it? Because there will be 400+ interest every month so that will exceed 100k,btohqsg
how come there is excess? did not empty account on 30 Sep?,btohqsg
Doubt so  usually grab voucher can only use for food/ mart/ transport,btohqsg
I did empty. There was 0 until November  when I put in funds. But once I put 100k in November  then I will get 400+ cos of the 5% interest,btohqsg
Based on previous promos  as long as your daily balance is at least 100k + the end of day balance on 30 Sep  any excess withdrawn (like interest earned) is okay,btohqsg

Hey guys  super new to this.If there are minimum eg: (UOB Evol  $600)  does it mean i have to spend 600 every single month? or how does it actually work,btohqsg
Yes every month need spend $600 to get the cashback else $0,btohqsg
Right  if i dont  no penalty or any sorts?,btohqsg
You need to spend minimum of $600 each month to get the *bonus* cashback.What he said was totally false. You'll still get 0.3% base cashback if you don't hit the minimum spending.Unless you're using UOB One card  where the minimum monthly spent is based on tiers and if you don't hit the minimum cashback tier  you'll get $0 for the quarter.,btohqsg
Thanks gotchu  meaning i'll have to plan months where i'd most likely hit the 600 in that specific month ( online + contactless ),btohqsg
I might have overlooked the 0.3% but it quite negligible in some sense 😅 ~,btohqsg
Suggest to look at cards like HSBC revo if you are struggling to constantly hit the min spending,btohqsg
Already have it! Looking to upgrade my CC game,btohqsg
This is a fake account right?,btohqsg
Yes  very clear. No premium  not in this group  username wrong.,btohqsg
HSBC Revo exclude dental or medical,btohqsg
yup yup. you are right. previously I mistaken that any contactless payment will get 4mpd. Now i realised only contactless of certain MCCs (inclusion model) will get 4mpd.,btohqsg
It operates on a whitelist model. Need to check tnc,btohqsg
yup. i am using instarem and heymax to check MCC now,btohqsg
realised Swee Heng is 5814 and not 5642(Bakery),btohqsg
5814 still have hsbc revolution rebate.,btohqsg
heymax shows mcc 5462. how u realise 5814?,btohqsg
I charged to my Instarem card and see the MCC. this is accurateHeymax is community contribution. some data might not be accurate,btohqsg
oic. btw heymax is based on mcc from visa api. Guess mcc for mastercard is different from visa,btohqsg
oh visa api. my apologies. it is possible that visa and master have different MCC,btohqsg
maybe heymax should factor that in since they will recommend the best cc to use,btohqsg

You can check the on how much to deposit to maintain MAB if you did withdrawals on UOB TMRW.If you think you have maintained MAB  you can check with UOB CSO to check.Safest strategy for UOB Stash account is deposit and don't withdraw anything.,btohqsg
I did withdraw and still got MAB for both sep n oct.,btohqsg
just downloaded iChange after watching Chris’ vid - in view of the better rates vs banks  can we exchange SGD > USD then transfer back to our bank acc or directly to the platforms for trading/investment?,btohqsg

Hi guru  can check for UOB one card if use more than 1k but never hit 2k  the expenses will not be able to have any cash rebate correct?,btohqsg
depends on ur tier also.if u are hitting 500 for your quarterly tier  beyond 500 u wont get rebate.,btohqsg
They only see if hit 500  1000  2000. And must be consecutive for 3 months.,btohqsg
Quick question  for overseas spending (so not including tickets and such)  would we be able to earn 4mpd with citi rewards + amaze? (foreign currency spend on things such like shopping),btohqsg
Got it  thanks a lot everyone  just got my card and hit 1k. Gotta spend 1k for two more months to receive the rebate full rebate for 1k tier correct? If not spend 500 on any month of the quarter will receive the 500 tier only.,btohqsg
Yes  looking for good dbs credit cards. Which one is the best? Tnx!,btohqsg
Does anyone know if buying travel insurance via Klook follows Klook mcc or is an excluded category for miles  say for UOB lady travel category?,btohqsg
No  you didn't answer the question  why dbs specifically? Difficult to say best card because it also depends on your spending habits,btohqsg
Because I have an account there and mostly use dbs. Spending around $800 per month. Interested in both cashback and miles,btohqsg
Let me know if anyone suggests any DBS credit cards,btohqsg
Personally think you should look beyond dbs. Many other cashback and miles cards.,btohqsg
No requirement to have account and credit card with same bank,btohqsg
You're limiting yourself to DBS for no good reason,btohqsg
For cashback  you could consider Citi Cashback/ UOB Evol/ DBS yuu (18%),btohqsg
For miles  Citi Rewards/ HSBC Revolution/ UOB Lady/ DBS WWMC,btohqsg
Pls do your own due diligence to see what is good for you. Esp for miles card  should also consider your value of a mile  conversion blocks  expiry etc,btohqsg
DBS Live Fresh. $400 contactless and $400 online for $40 rebate per month.,btohqsg
highest credit card cashback for public transport ?,btohqsg
Dbs interest is one of the worse among the local banks. And their credit cards hardly make it to most of the top cashback or miles card list. Not to mention their frequent IT issues.,btohqsg
Which bank/ card you recommend ?,btohqsg

Really depend on what u are buying. U need to tell more such as what merchant and the amt u spending to get better advice. A generic one might not apply to ur case,btohqsg
buying sofa   dining table   water heatermore onto local and foreign currency spend,btohqsg
hi  any fees when Top-up via PayNow QR?,btohqsg
Can consider those that is foreign currency that give 4mpd (uob vs 2k) and paywave (uob ppv 1.11k  uob vs 2k) that give 4mpd. If online can consider dbs wwmc 4mpd 2k  citi reward 4mpd 1k.,btohqsg
can check is there a UOB CC equivalent to OCBC 365 CC?,btohqsg
What do u intend to spend on the card?,btohqsg
There is no equivalant for uob. More of citibank cashback card to ocbc 360,btohqsg
But uob have other option where by u can consider such as uob evol or uob one for cashback team,btohqsg
will take a look at evol. thanks.,btohqsg
If you're using uob one account  you can match it with uob one card for the above spending. If you can hit the minimum tier spending each month of course,btohqsg
Is there a way to know the list of items that got Cashback or qualified for the cashback for evol?,btohqsg
read the excluded list in term and condition  anything not inside excluded list is eligible  nobody can do the work for you and only yourself,btohqsg
Hm because I'm looking at some transaction that doesn't look like it went thru gpay but I used gpay,btohqsg
So I'm trying to see how they identify if it was an online transactions or direct card payment,btohqsg
Gpay most prob is clock as mobile contactless,btohqsg
Hi  does paying SingTel mobile monthly bill falls in the category of UOB evol CC?,btohqsg
sguob01 code really works. I think got some $50 off for a ticket. Not sure if there are any other way to get more discount for Emirates ticket,btohqsg
Amaze Card tagged to Citi Rewards Card.> If we top up Amaze Wallet using the same Citi Rewards Card  will we earn 10x Citi Rewards Points?,btohqsg
But I see some transaction will state gpay but some doesn't,btohqsg
Tap machine using card is contactless.Tap machine using phone is mobile contactless.Paid using gpay is online.Mobile contactless won't show as gpay  it will show up as how you do it using card to tap on machine.,btohqsg
Uh I know... But how does the system identify if where I tap using card or I tap using gpay looks the same in the statement? I hope my question not confusing 😅,btohqsg
It knows  just avoid using direct card if you're evol.,btohqsg
So there's no summary for the cashback in this sense?,btohqsg
You can self track on excel or something. It clocks under minimum spending  just not getting 8% cashback.,btohqsg
There's no benefit to using the card directly anyway. Even at ATM machine  tapping with gpay lets you withdraw money,btohqsg
Fromhere:After you've authenticated your transaction  the Secure Element provides your Device Account Number and a dynamic  transaction-specific security code to the shop’s point of sale terminal  along with additional information needed to complete the transaction.Again  neither Apple nor your device sends your actual payment card number.So it can different if the card was used directly or it was ApplePay/GPay,btohqsg
Tap the card for the remaining $100 after maxing the online and mobile contactless categories for that extra 0.3%? 🤣,btohqsg
I'm sure you'll still get 0.03% for transactions exceeding the cashback limit. But does that 3 cents really matter? 🤔,btohqsg
Ah it does? Haha  well it is to get the most out of the card 🫣,btohqsg
I dont think so coz they cap each cat,btohqsg
Hi experts  can I check how do you all topup your TNG from iChange? Is it to add ichange Mastercard in the TNG app then topup via the card?,btohqsg
Your MAB in Sep must equal or more than MAB in Aug  then can get Sep interestYour MAB in Oct must equal or more than MAB in Sep  then can get Oct interest.Even MAB is only 1 cent less compared to  previous month  you will lost the bonus interest.,btohqsg
"I'm sure they do  my card has only been used for online or mobile contactless purchases. And after maxing out both cashback categories  I was still given 22 cents more as part of ""Other Spend"".I did not spend an extra $73.33 on non qualifying spend to get that 22 cents. 🤔It's a win-win situation  so no complaints here.",btohqsg
U can try and let us know if tng app take i change mastercard,btohqsg
Can get 0.3% for physical contactless.,btohqsg

Nope  they need to have their own krisflyer account  just set up for them. I do that for my parent too. The point can be transfer to krispay to exchange for ntuc voucher if they dont managed to accumulate enough miles for flight,btohqsg
Cant transfer can only use it up via the ichange mastercard,btohqsg
Is it possible to transfer from parent's acc to own acc?,btohqsg

generally oversea spending in certain country (etc japan) might not be allocated as what is their business intended activities  so best to check mcc thru amaze by making small payment to verify.,btohqsg
Hi  wld appreciate feedback/improvements on my c.c strategyUOB Lady's Card (Travel) - Dedicated SpendUOB Privimiles -General Spend,btohqsg
really depend on your spending habit,btohqsg
just some heavy travel spending till end of the year,btohqsg
other than that just casual spending on the cards,btohqsg
"add UOB PPV for ""general spend""  if it's mobile contactless >$5 it's 4 mpd",btohqsg
there is a requirement for the card to be mobile contactless??,btohqsg
honeymoney got referral code for DOBIN?,btohqsg
where is it stated though? as i checked the website,btohqsg
sorry im referring to UOB Privi miles card,btohqsg
ya so Sylv is asking you to also consider UOB PPV,btohqsg
"Because Prvi is general spending  you could earn 4mpd on a ""specialised spending"" card like PPV",btohqsg
which is more than the 1.something on prvi,btohqsg
ohhh i cant apply PPV as they do not allow secured applications,btohqsg
dont get it by what u mean  after you are approved for first secured cc  you can apply for other uob card as well as uob cc shared same credit limit,btohqsg
After u get first secured card  login to uob ibank do online application.,btohqsg
ohhhh okay shall try it soon,btohqsg
They longer provide this option through paper form during secured application  but once u are approve secured credit card  can try to apply other uob cc in ibank as the card shared same credit limit,btohqsg
So the amount on the app is not the final amount posted?,btohqsg
The final amt use the posted one.,btohqsg
There's premier miles and prestige fcy transaction promo now. Should work since you mention heavy spending,btohqsg

Amaze transaction now included the MCC can cross check it with heymax website,btohqsg
How long does a transaction take to be posted ?,btohqsg
depends on merchant  most take 2-3 days,btohqsg
mine was rejected the first time  bcos they used the salary info i submitted for another cc application years back (when my salary was less than 120k). had to do an online salary review and resubmit the application then it got approved after a few days. u can check ur application status using the reference number u received in ur email.,btohqsg
Is instagrem still a good option to use for payment?,btohqsg

Hi guys  can I check if anyone had use atome installment with hsbc revolution card? Does it falls under eligible transaction?,btohqsg
Y not jus use uob lady which qualifies for the one acc interest as well? And focus solely on miles to accumulate faster?,btohqsg
Hmm. True that. Because using UOB one for utility bill as well for its cash back too. But very tired of having to spend consistently. HahahaNot very good at miles game yet but will this strategy work?1. UOB lady card - travel (SimplyGo  grab etc) since no minimum spend2. HSBC Revolution card - grocery  dining and other general expenses,btohqsg
The category for SimplyGo/Grab is Transport not Travel  I guess you just have to make sure your spending on utilities on uob one debit and transport on lady's is min $500,btohqsg
Yes it does  do trigger manually for second and third payment,btohqsg
Any idea how is this even possible 🧐 This is even better than interbank rates…,btohqsg
Thank you  kinda like a hack cuz the store I'm purchasing from is not eligible for those bonus if direct paywabe. Quite lucky to have this pay later function  making it eligible,btohqsg
My bad for for the typo.Means to say combined spending on both cards hit $500? This minimum spending is for the UOB one account interest?,btohqsg
Yep just for uob one acc interest,btohqsg
hi all let’s say i have the instarem amaze + CRMC combo.i pay with amaze on a dining expenditure in Thailand.Do i earn miles??,btohqsg
Anyone know if I use my uob one card to buy Cold Storage voucher got additional 5% cashback?,btohqsg
Hi all. Is anyone aware if utilities is excluded for maybank platinum visa?,btohqsg
Thanks Queenie. In that case  it’s a good card to use for foreign transaction + earning miles yeah?,btohqsg
Save slightly on foreign fee plus get miles,btohqsg
Bosses can advise what's the best way to pay insurance currently? Understand there's some nerf etc.,btohqsg
Alright got it! Would you recommend the miles pairing to be UOB Lady’s card with HSBC Revolution or UOB PPV?The miles pooling for UOB is quite attractive but the $5 spend block quite annoying. And hsbc has no annual fees ever which is a plus but the white/blacklist is a minus.,btohqsg
uob ppv dun count to uob one account card spend bonus interest. uob lady is the only miles card that do. would u be able to meet min $500 spend monthly on uob lady card? btw 5.6mpd bonus points on uob lady has no $5 block.,btohqsg
Yeap understand that the UOB PPV doesn’t count for the bonus interest. For my miles and also UOB one account bonus interest strategy would be smth like this:1. UOB one debit card for utilities and bills around ($200 ish)2. UOB lady’s card for transportation usage (grab and simplygo) (around $300)3. HSBC Revolution or UOB PPVLeaning more towards the HSBC Revolution card for the $1 block spend. Any inputs on this?,btohqsg
Still trying to figure it out base on my expenses and spending habit  thanks for the patience 🙏🏻,btohqsg
Yes this does work to earn you the bonus interest. HSBC Revo is a good card  but you can consider Amaze+CRMC too since you have taken care of utilities and simplygo on UOB which are 2 excluded categories on CRMC. Then HSBC Revo can be used for flight/hotel bookings to optimize all your spending into miles,btohqsg
This sounds good to go  thank you so much Wilson  Trazora and Zion!For CRMC and Amaze  must tap physical card correct? My research tells me that Apple Pay doesn’t grant us the full miles earned. But is tap using Amaze card correct? 🤔,btohqsg

As of now Apple Pay doesn't support amaze  so you'll have to tap the physical (and uglier) card to earn 4 mpd on CRMC linked to it. If you prefer using Apple Pay  Revo does most of the job well  check whitelisted mcc to be sure,btohqsg
Hahaha  right. I think I’ll have both and use Revo as a main card and switch it around when I need to book air ticket and hotel for travels due to 1k cap per month. Either way both is a good to have cards in the wallet 🤗,btohqsg
Just checked  they only support SGD to MYR  not the other way round,btohqsg

Hi guys  new here! Just wanted to be sure  if i set up recurring card payment on SP App for my utilities bill (paid using UOB One Debit card)  will that automatic charge to my debit card count towards the $500 min spend for the UOB One Account interest? Thank you!,btohqsg
Hi  does paying SingTel mobile monthly bill falls in the category of UOB evol CC?,btohqsg
Actually for sgd to myr  CIMB SG has one of the best rates. However  you need to open a CIMB MY account to deposit the myr after exchange. Do check it out,btohqsg
I think you asked this question twice. If nobody answer  means you can search the chat history to get the answer.,btohqsg
i see. thank you for the heads up,btohqsg
I have cimb account  but what I need now is to convert MYR to SGD  not the other way round,btohqsg
For those who opened the UOB Stash account which needs to maintain $100K or increase the Monthly Average Balance  may I know if you withdraw out the monthly interest as if it is over $100K  the interest is only 0.05%?  Thanks.,btohqsg
Hi morning to all experts here  may I check what will happen to the CPF allocation after reaching FRS on CPF SA account? Will 100% of new CPF contributions goes into OA account?,btohqsg
It remains unchanged. Your SA just continues to grow. The key difference is that you can no longer RSTU  and your MA contributions will overflow into your OA.,btohqsg

Was surprised to see Paris baguette offering 8mpd on Kris+ when I bought some bread this morning. Previously was 6mpd,btohqsg
Sorry for the confusion.  Remittance cannot.  Money exchange can.,btohqsg
I think there’s a TT function from MYR to SGD in the CIMB MY internet banking platform. According to their ads  they guarantee best rates in town. But from experience  it’s easy and very good rates to change sgd to myr  but not the other way round. Just a demand and supply reality of the currencies. Hope that helps,btohqsg
Guys anyone know how to check the bonus OCBC$ credited to your rewards balance?,btohqsg

Thanks! That’s what I’m wondering  does it not show the 9x remaining OCBC$ when credited?,btohqsg
1X posted with the transaction  bonus 9X is posted by the end of the next calendar month.,btohqsg
Yeap am aware  it’s been 2 months but I don’t see the 9X balance being reflected anywhere basically,btohqsg
@ChrisHMSGu missed out on the $168 referral reward for moomoo.,btohqsg

Hi anyone know if the salary hack (transfer money to yourself with purpose code SALA) works for stanchart Bonus saver?,btohqsg
Just wanna check… when paying with Citi Payall  there will be a one-time service fee in order to earn the card rewards. If I choose another option of Citi Payall with zero fees  I don’t earn the card rewards.In this case  why would ppl choose to pay with Citi PayAll though? Or am I misunderstanding it?,btohqsg
Ppl pay the fee to earn card rewards,btohqsg
Hi guys  just received sms about my UOB Evol card got approved and see in UOB TMRW under “Accounts”Just want to check if I am able to see the card details or a virtual card to add to Apple Pay or use online now? Or have to wait for the physical card to arrive via mail?,btohqsg
Maybe it is just me  but isn't this spending pattern the perfect combi for UOB One card?Utilities (200ish) gets 4.33% rebateGrab and SimplyGo ($300) get 8.33% rebate.And total spend just nice reach $500 mark for UOB One card as well as UOB One account bonus interest.If this is spending pattern is not using UOB One card  then we should never use UOB One card ever~~ 😂Anyway you can calculate how much cash rebate you will get if you use UOB One card and compare with the miles if you use Lady's + HSBC Rev or UOB PPV. It all depends your own miles valuation.,btohqsg
What is the reward scale that worth ppl paying the fee for? I totally dont get how it works,btohqsg
Does UOB usually waive the credit card annual fees if we submit request?,btohqsg
For card payment via shopback app  does eligible transactions counted in for majority of the credit cards?,btohqsg
Does DCS Ultimate Platinum Mastercard gives cashback for simplygo bus/mrt rides?,btohqsg
"Usually is auto if you hit their eligibility requirements. Else you have to request via their app and see what they say.Chris got rejected for fee waiver before  and he asked to cancel card  they quietly waive the fees.For ""cancellation""  I think still depends whether you're worthy for them to keep you as a customer.",btohqsg
think of it as paying for miles at a discounted rate,btohqsg
Is uob kf 3mpd on top of kris+ app mpd earning?,btohqsg

I usually pay my diff bank credit cards by adding as a payee on UOB ibanking and just transferring the amt over  but there are multiple folks here who highlight it doesn’t work in this chat. Just spoke to a CSO and she told me transferring from another bank works so wonder if anyone can give a definitive answer,btohqsg
