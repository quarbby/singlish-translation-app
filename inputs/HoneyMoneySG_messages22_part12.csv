yes as Abs is a UOB card not AMEX card,btohqsg
Hi got a problem with liquid pay  as I haven't received my physical card from citi reward.I tried adding the virtual card in and got rejected. Do I have to wait for the actual card to reach me before they allow?,btohqsg
Have you activated CRMC on the Citi App?,btohqsg
Anybody have an idea. For the 1k spending 4mpd limit for hsbc revolution or Citi rewardsThe cut off date is when ? Is every month day 1 or.Cheers if anybody have answer,btohqsg
Haven't  cause haven't received the physical card yet. Only have the virtual,btohqsg
hsbc revolution based on posted transactions in calendar month.crmc based on posted transactions in statement month,btohqsg
Using the Nets app  can topup using Amex but with $0.50 charge per transactionBut dunno if Absolute can give cash back  i don't think they give üòîThis is from UOB websiteTransactions at all merchants who accept American Express credit card payments are eligible for cashback.However  it does not include NETS and NETS-related transactions,btohqsg
I'm not sure if this is possible. Take note that Wise can't be used as Gemini only accepts fedwire transfers but Wise can only send ACH,btohqsg
can check on dbs ibanking chatbot,btohqsg
Hi sifus  currently I am having DBS Altitude and HSBC Revo. And tomorrow im going to Starhub to sign up plan and need to pay upfront to get the phone. Is revo entitled for 10X or i should go for altitude?,btohqsg
Don't think HSBC Revo awards 10x for starhub  DBS altitude would be safer,btohqsg
From my understanding HSBC REVO VISA. as long is online or contactless purchase via Apple Pay or google pay.,btohqsg
Provided not under exclusion list. Which StarHub shouldn‚Äôt be a problem and should gives u 4mpd,btohqsg
no  must be in mcc whitelist also,btohqsg
What's the best fixed deposit route for now? Do y'all think we should go in before the end of year?,btohqsg
Hi may I ask for citibank smrt card  does online payment via PayPal to a renovation company count as 5 percent cashback?,btohqsg
As in for StarHub. Those are not under mcc exclusion,btohqsg
If want to top up SA when is a good time as now end of year,btohqsg
31 Dec or 1 jan ?,btohqsg
By 31 Dec if u want it to count for this year's tax relief,btohqsg
I have ever made PayPal transactions before and they were counted for 5% cashback. Think generally it is considered as online,btohqsg
Will the use of hsbc revolution at sinopec earn the 4miles per dollar?,btohqsg
HSBC Revo works on a whitelist not blacklist. So only MCCs listed in the whitelist earns 10x  those MCCs not in the list are excluded from 10x,btohqsg
Anyone has any idea what the mcc for Wells Singapore is?,btohqsg
Don't think so that petrol stations is on HSBC Revo whitelist,btohqsg
I thought if pay through wave and online all can,btohqsg
Shags ur right. My bad. So I guess Citi reward is still the best when tag with amaze,btohqsg
Yea it kinda complements the Citi Rewards card for travel expenses. No harm having both since HSBC Revo has no min spend üòÅ,btohqsg
Citirewards have white list also no?,btohqsg
Only exclude travel and offline purchase. So has to tag with amaze,btohqsg
General spending without travel should be fine haha else just use the Citi miles don‚Äôt think so much,btohqsg
But base on the above is just like the hsbc revolution,btohqsg
Ya Citi Rewards more like a blacklist system than whitelist where travel expenses are blacklisted,btohqsg
Citi rewards also capped bonus point at 9k per month,btohqsg
Like that it's exactly like revolution,btohqsg
See the clause 6(ii)  they allow most online transactions except mobile wallet and travel transactions,btohqsg
Point 13. Capped at 9k bonus points per month,btohqsg
So if you have below 1k spemding per month den choose 1,btohqsg
But I think revo white list problem as mention above,btohqsg
I waiting for new member promo for hsbc den I sign,btohqsg
Makes it more confusing. So the reward 1 card method easier,btohqsg
Yea I got a switch for it,btohqsg
I will use on fairprice app. Lazada  shopee so revo should be ok,btohqsg
I am already having premieremiles card,btohqsg
So no sign up bonus for rewards for me,btohqsg
Hsbc revolution no annual fee also so can just apply and keep  use it when necessary as a secondary card,btohqsg
The annual fee makes alot of diff.,btohqsg
Ignore the annual fees. That can always be waived,btohqsg
If balance $100K  it would not be highest interest?,btohqsg
If not just go with uob krisflyer. 3miles per dollar,btohqsg
