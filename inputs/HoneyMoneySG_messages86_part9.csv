my wife was recently asked by UOB to consider opening a UOB ladies Saving.Any point on opening this bank account if one already has a UOB1 bank account in terms of %? Did a quick google seems like UOB Ladies saving has less pure interest but have other random benefitsCSO claimed that the spending on the UOB ladies card does not qualify for UOB1 Bank account - CC spending category -> sounds like fake new?,btohqsg
I cannot even sign up for iChange with singpass,btohqsg
Like what Y Y mentioned cant sign up horrible support etc u can look at the reviews on google play store lots of one star reviews,btohqsg
but the card still can be used? cuz i see the exchange rate is better thn youtrip,btohqsg
Im just gathering info is all cause there are others who are skeptical,btohqsg
I find it quite good. The only issue is the physical card takes months to deliver. Other than that everything is fine especially the exchange rate.,btohqsg
the leftovers just topup grab then withdraw. It's treated as debit card so can withdraw. Last i withdraw was 1.7k.,btohqsg
Is there a minimum amount to withdraw when sent to grab iirc there is if im not wrong when u say grab i presume u mean the grabwallet correct?,btohqsg
it's through paynow  don't think got minimum. topup will have minimum though  and can't topup with those cents,btohqsg

Hi everyone can I ask for some advice. I have my home loan  that I wanted to try to reprice/refinance. Would you recommend going for a fixed rate for next 2 years? Or continue with float?,btohqsg

Oh is that the only way? So it essentially works like YouTrip?,btohqsg
The prudent answer: Go with fixed  so that your budget costs are predictable. Try to negotiate for a free reprice 1 year in to hedge your bets if interest rates drastically drop within the next year so you're not locked in for a full 2 years.Financial forecast answer: (Personally) I expect interest rates to drop over time over the next year  but whether float is worth it depends on what is the difference in interest rates offered to you  how quickly you think interest rates will drop over the next year  and how much you can stomach if interest rates don't go down or go up even.,btohqsg

Hi can I check for miles card points validity  if it says 1 year  and I believe you can hold miles in krisflyer for 2 years  that means you‚Äôve up to 3 years to use your miles right?,btohqsg
But iirc KF expiry is 3 yrs,btohqsg
That means you need to pay miles conversion fee every year n also your orphan miles will be expired every year.,btohqsg

Hello... jus checked mine for amaze + crmc transactions on 20th... same no 10x points,btohqsg
"for those who transferred out from IBKR  is it okay to select ""Webull Securities Ltd"" instead of ""Webull Securities (Singapore) Pte. Ltd."" since their drop-down list doesnt state the latter option?Also  is it okay to transfer via Basic FOP Transfer to Webull? IBKR said they can only transfer via this way but Webull says this is not DTC. Does this mean I cannot successfully qualify for the promotion? Grateful for anyone who has successfully transferred from ibkr to help guide!TIA!",btohqsg
