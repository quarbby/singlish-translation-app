nice reg number triples and 2 sets of doubles,btohqsg
hello  if i just quit my job  can i apply for hle as employed since i have past 3 months salary slips?,btohqsg
as long as 3 months continuous working unless you are taking grant,btohqsg
grant is only applicable for income up to the day of application,btohqsg
as I found out for my own application ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
I think itâ€™s closer to something like May  Jun  Jul 2021 if youâ€™re applying for Aug 2021 (now),btohqsg
itâ€™ll lock in and not regard any changes from Aug onwards,btohqsg
but will they get numbers from 1 - 1000 since it is random number? Or are their Q number be from 1001 onwards?,btohqsg
impossible for 1 at least starts from 20?,btohqsg
based on luck the smaller the better,btohqsg
Hi  if the HLE letter is valid till 16 Aug 2021 but I am applying for August BTOwill it still be valid or will I have to reapply HLE letter again,btohqsg
No  HLE for appointment date which is 3-4 months later,btohqsg
You should just apply when it expires  no rush to do it now anyway,btohqsg
best is to apply a week before your appointment,btohqsg
Am I allowed to apply for BTO  get queue number and later still apply for SBF? Advanced thq.,btohqsg
sbf launches in Nov  in unison with BTO launch,btohqsg
you have to see the timeline   see how good is your no,btohqsg
sbf launches every year in may and Nov,btohqsg
Aug results will be out before 8th Sept (2 months away to Nov BTO) if your number is good  maybe your selection date is earlier than the Nov launch so wait and see,btohqsg
otherwise if selection is later than the launch then maybe you can consider to apply for the sbf,btohqsg
will Sbf have the same price as current BTO?Assuming  it is a same project but reapplying again.,btohqsg
paying more in an exchange of shorter waiting time,btohqsg
Is there a range of total income between yourself and partner before youâ€™re able to apply between a 4-room bto or a 3-room bto?,btohqsg
To apply  I think they just want to see whether u can secure an active hle or loan or not. Don't think that they are that stringent at the flat selection phase.But the key is whether u think u can get hle for a loan or an ipa for a bank loan that is enough to cover the price of your bto flat. If you can't pay at that point  u waited for nothing and u lost your down-payment.And considering how expensive btos  are these days.... Ya. Plan ahead.,btohqsg
base salary would be increased years down the road also mah,btohqsg
That's the general assumption la haha,btohqsg
so say if you can get HLE now but upon key collections your combined salary more than $14k  HDB won't stop you from moving to your BTO too,btohqsg
but have to switch to bank loan,btohqsg
that's something new to me  didn't know that!So let's say you already paid your 10% down payment with HDB  when you collect keys and switch to bank loan  how much you have to pay upfront?,btohqsg
that's if your combined is > $14k,btohqsg
sorry I don't have knowledge for this only know that you need to be on HDB loan for 6 months before the conversion to bank loan,btohqsg
Can switch before key collection but downpayment will be 25% including 5% by cash. If switch after key collection I think no such requirement  but can only switch after 6 months.,btohqsg
Note that once u switch to bank loan no turning back. But initial is HDB loan  u anytime can change to bank loan.,btohqsg
so can I confirm that before BTO key collection  if your combined salary is more than 14k  you must switch to bank loan?,btohqsg
based on what@yyx123said  I think if you have the means to pay 20% CPF and 5% cash to switch over bank loan to enjoy lower yet fluctuating interest  can consider,btohqsg
so the 10% downpayment u made to HDB will be returned to you  then you will need to do the 20% CPF + 5% cash directly to bank?,btohqsg
Sorry I can't confirm that have to switch,btohqsg
no worries  I'll call HDB to check later  have to get a unit first else no need talk so much  haha,btohqsg
but no such thing as refund to you bah???,btohqsg
Anyone can access the open flat booking now? Can't seem to see the flats available,btohqsg
Looks like nothing for open booking,btohqsg
strange  i donâ€™t see this page on the web,btohqsg
it still says 13 August 2021,btohqsg
Let's just wait and see for today,btohqsg
I thought it was at the point of application hmmmm,btohqsg
I also saw is 12pm today,btohqsg
it is changed to 1st sep at 10am,btohqsg
i think was always 1st sep haha,btohqsg
they say today is let us know when will be available for viewing,btohqsg
actually  they did say they will announce the supply today,btohqsg
