How does ChatGPT know all the shit it knows? Because it just crawls the web and trains anything it can find that it deems useful. Same for AI image generation.

@Kopi0kos0ngA recent example (circa 2008) of reflexivity in modern financial markets is that of the debt and equity of housing markets.[61]Lenders began to make more money available to more people in the 1990s to buy houses. More people bought houses with this larger amount of money  thus increasing the prices of these houses. Lenders looked at their balance sheets  which not only showed that they had made more loans  but that the collaterals backing the loans – the value of the houses – had gone up (because more money was chasing the same amount of housing  relatively). Thus they lent out more money because their balance sheets looked good  and prices rose higher still.,btohqsg
Same underlying dynamics stagflation > recession > recovery same money chasing limited goods reset when music ends.,btohqsg

狗急跳墙  europe is still representative of a strong industralized union.if squeeze europe  europe goes to russia. simple. then US loses europe sphere of influence totally and zero credibility.so then become US trades with india solely? because africa is secured by russia and china liao. and middle east only trades oil with US as a seller. If US tariffs europe then US will be a very lonely loner losing influence everywhere.the US deep state economic planners will know better not to do anything to europeand you think indians loyal? 😂😂😂talk to accountants and auditors doing indian markets.machiam indian maths,btohqsg
which brings us to why the US talking crap of wanting to secure or buy panama canal now 😂,btohqsg

I tikam one   anytime wrong. 😂,btohqsg
Only quote based on news fa,btohqsg
See goldmine right or Trump right,btohqsg
😂 jokes aside  US oilies production breakeven if not wrong was 30 to 40+ (editted this part-> yup was not wrong),btohqsg
that was when it was really hot and prices of fixed investments were cheap,btohqsg
after many rigs and anciliary industry to O &G went bust (note teho international is in such sector)  the average production price is around 40 to 50+ after all the high costs and inflation,btohqsg
so for oilies to drop further  given that there is mandate for eu to buy us oil  UK gas prices must fall first.which it havent and is still up up and away  i will do one better;you can check the stats here (plus this buay zhun cause yet to factor fixed investment purchases bidding if want to increase production)https://www.statista.com/statistics/748207/breakeven-prices-for-us-oil-producers-by-oilfield/so rex (direct EU oil digger) and anan (direct europe petrol provider) got chance to huat.,btohqsg
if US ramp production now it actually causes price war competition for fixed assets which will destroy their edge to 50 to 60+ breakeven costs.it happened before when shale was introduced and will happen again.the saudis will retaliate to maintain market share by at most drop floor price to 60 or 70 max.beyond that US oil will not survive one.you go check rigs count and costs you will understand.so the only chance is sanction on healthcare which he is big on.so direct healthcare in US or EU got coverage is who?UG healthcare 👍positioning,btohqsg
do feel free to whack my explanation so i can learn thanks,btohqsg
this is also why got one big shale company diamond billionaire just cashed out and relax for entire life for entire family.his costs is lowest and he bloodbathed before.then notice how berkshire keep buy exxon and other oilies?they know this cycle,btohqsg
yup earning good $ on cashpile risk free,btohqsg
