🧨A New Headwind is Appearing⛽️💸USD strength gaining Traction💰The US Dollars have been gaining strength  and often this does not bode well for the US market. Since the start of the year  we have taken a contrarian view of the US dollars- while a majority of the people had expected a weaker USD  we have called for a firmer dollar. The case of a weaker dollar was easy. The sizeable fiscal spending will require a large treasury volume  which will likely increase the money supply and thus weaken the USD.🪜Our Contrarian Take📻However  this did not turn out to be true because the issuance of the treasury is relatively stable  and much of the pandemic stimulus set aside during the Trump era was not entirely spent. Moreover  a somewhat volatile political and economic environment encourages investors to park funds in a haven like the USD. Higher inflation also boosts the prospect of an interest rate hike  which promotes the dollar's strength relative to other currencies. These factors have generally strengthened the USD.📈USD and its impact on Equity🔍Companies tend to use a stronger dollar as a reason for poorer performance. After all  S&P 500 companies generally derive 40% of their revenue from international markets  and their revenue tends to reduce in value when converted back in USD from other currencies. A small number of companies appear to have started speaking about the negative impact of a strong USD on their earnings in the future.While the above reasons seem logical and compelling  Pika World believes that the reason could be one of convenience than in reality for the poor performance of corporate earnings. If we observe the current market condition  the strong USD had not dented the equity market. The S&P 500 return for the year thus far is around 24%  about three times its historical average.🧮Expenses and Hedging🔒A stronger dollar is not an absolute negative for companies. Indeed  on the revenue end  it might make the figure smaller. Still  on the expenses side  companies with a significant international presence also tend to have considerable operations paid in nondollar currencies. Hence  these expenses may also look smaller when converted in USD. Furthermore  many MNCs tend to hedge some level of currency exposures and may deter material impacts of currency fluctuation into their earnings.As the earnings seasons continue  we may gain more insights from corporate leaders on their woes with a strong USD  and perhaps at times  we can take with a pinch of salt the prominent role of USD in affecting revenue.We hope you enjoy this latest insight and have a restful evening.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg
