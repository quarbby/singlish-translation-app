Eventually when your 3 years is up   they will have to replace with a M chip laptop for you.,btohqsg

Depends on what you use for,btohqsg

Can run some lighter games also,btohqsg
I think I need to use it soon,btohqsg
But based on my experience   Apple is more reliable than Windows laptops.,btohqsg
Yet to come across a Windows laptop that doesnâ€™t give problems within 1 year.,btohqsg
Dell   Asus   HP   Toshiba   LG   Acer . All have issues.,btohqsg
The issues are mostly either SSD   motherboard    sound card malfunction  or something else.,btohqsg
Dunno why like no luck with Windows stuff.,btohqsg
