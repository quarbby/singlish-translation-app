"For all that matters like you'd said it's a saying in the very least . It's valid to a certain extent but at the same time I mean there's lots of scenarios/circumstances which may or may not lead to someone finding that saying ""relatable"" in any way",btohqsg
It sounds like you're navigating complex emotions about someone from your past  and it's completely normal for feelings to evolve over time. Here are a few pieces of advice to consider as you navigate this situation:Reflect on Your Feelings: Take some time to reflect on your feelings and try to understand where they're coming from. Consider what attracted you to this person in the past and what aspects of your relationship with them are important to you now.Consider the Past Incident: Reflect on the incident that occurred between you two in 2021 and how it may have impacted your feelings. Are there unresolved issues or lingering emotions from that experience that are resurfacing now?Evaluate Your Expectations: Be mindful of your expectations regarding your relationship with this person. Are you hoping for a romantic connection  or are you content with maintaining a friendly relationship? Understanding your expectations can help you approach the situation with clarity.Communication is Key: If you feel comfortable  consider having an open and honest conversation with this person about your feelings. It's important to communicate openly and respectfully  regardless of the outcome. This can help clarify your feelings and potentially strengthen your connection  whether it's as friends or something more.Take Things Slow: Whether you decide to pursue a romantic relationship or maintain a friendship  take things slow and allow your feelings to develop naturally. Rushing into anything may lead to confusion or unintended consequences.Focus on Yourself: Remember to prioritize your own well-being and happiness. Spend time engaging in activities that bring you joy  pursuing your interests  and nurturing your friendships and relationships with others.Seek Support if Needed: If you're feeling overwhelmed or uncertain about your feelings  don't hesitate to seek support from trusted friends  family members  or a counselor. Talking through your emotions with someone you trust can provide valuable insight and perspective.Ultimately  it's important to trust your instincts and make choices that align with your values and desires. Whether you choose to explore your feelings further or maintain a platonic friendship  prioritize honesty  communication  and mutual respect in your interactions with this person.,btohqsg
