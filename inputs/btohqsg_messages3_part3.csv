Nevertheless I truly wish u huaaaat,btohqsg
SBF ballot number came through :D,btohqsg
Keep posted! Wish u huaaaat too,btohqsg

it's great! now just need to worry about the HLE hahaha,btohqsg
yeah it's a good problem to have haha,btohqsg
for those who get queue numberu guys opt for how many rm flat?,btohqsg

mine failed to get queue number T_T,btohqsg
thus curious..u guys bid how many rm flat and which area.><,btohqsg
woah nice! we'll be neighbors soon hahaha,btohqsg
ur number also very near sia,btohqsg
but my mum only wants high floor which has like 7 units,btohqsg
Any one know the next Sfb?,btohqsg
I havent receive any email for the ballot number 😞,btohqsg
Ok nvm i just saw HAHAH,btohqsg
seems like a good news response! CONGRAT,btohqsg
how many rm unit and where ar?,btohqsg
yishun seems like easier ah?earlier got 2 of them also yishun,btohqsg
When is the selection exercise starting so late,btohqsg
My last sbf also same. Nov sbf april then select,btohqsg
is it stay in yishun ballot for yishun easier to get good queue number?,btohqsg
I guess so since it's a non mature estate,btohqsg
unless you are using the MCPS whereby your parents stay at yishun,btohqsg
Not really I suppose. For this SBF Yishun was hardly subscribed since the beginning. It only ticked to 1.0 application rate on the day before the application closes so it's a sure-get situation for first-timers.,btohqsg
Oh so you don’t stay in yishun too?,btohqsg
will be much easier if my mum is not fussy on the level of the unit,btohqsg
Great note to end this miserable year,btohqsg
How many high floor units are there and what level does your define high floor as,btohqsg
I stay at yishun la so I have the proximity priority. That's probably why the number is good but nonetheless it's sure-get lah for those who chose Yishun SBF,btohqsg
Ah i see! I’m using MCPS though and this is my fourth time balloting. it’s always out of queue or last twenty for unit selection even after waiting for one year to refresh. ):so i’m wondering what can i to gain higher chance. i guess gov don’t encourage us to stay near parents anymore  because they will do our job in supporting our parents for us when they in need of help such as bring them to see doctor when they sick etc. was looking at the convenience for future purposes since both our parents stay yishun but i guess balloting other non mature estate seems to be a better choice );,btohqsg
nonetheless thankyou all for the prompt replies! 🥰,btohqsg
There could be other factors too I suppose. We live nearby and we are new parents so the chances are naturally higher?,btohqsg
So if there are many new parents applying as first-timers then it definitely affects your ballot number,btohqsg
above #11  for 47sqm think they are 3 or 4 units nia,btohqsg
Curious to know more about govt scheme to bring elderly for appointment.,btohqsg
Recently saw the new interior design in MyNiceHome Gallery. Is this the gate we will be getting at Canberra Vista?,btohqsg
I know that is why I am asking whether anyone knows what is the gate design. Anyone knows?,btohqsg
Hi  my BTO for sembawang 3 rm on November queue no 156  the unit only 84. Is there still got chance to book a flat?,btohqsg
