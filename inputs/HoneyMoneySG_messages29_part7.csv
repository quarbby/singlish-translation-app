As user  your card is the same but between Apple and merchant your card no is not the same. Try to ask the print out of your CC after you make payment at the cashier  you will see your last 4 virtual card number is different from your actual card. It is for your card security.,btohqsg
Yes can  but need to go down to branch physically to apply,btohqsg

Guys will i be eligble for singsaver hsbc ega account opening reward ? I got my hsbc revo card approved a few days ago. I cant seem to open it using singsaver links,btohqsg
There's no application number. You just need to enter the last 4 digits of the phone number you used in the application to fill-up the form for Singsaver,btohqsg
Similarly applied but I didn't receive any email from Singsaver...have written to them,btohqsg
Anyone able to participate in the singsaver promo for signing up for the hsbc ega account even after holding a hsbc credit card?,btohqsg
Oh! Wah ok I did‚Äôt know this. I think I‚Äôll just re-add back my credit card to all the apps once the physical card arrives and I activate it,btohqsg
I think the terms and conditions say u need to use the unique link that they send to u to sign up.At the Singsaver page  when u click apply on their offer  u will be brought to a page to key in your email address.Once u send that off  u will receive an email from SingSaver with the unique link for you to click apply and key in your preferred reward.,btohqsg
Understand from their cso  you can manually apply online,btohqsg
Yah I think that‚Äôs the default action. I was replying to Ee Thai for mentioning that one can apply manually for Sing Saver promo at bank branch that‚Äôs why. I not sure if can coz the TnC states to register using the link given to u in email.,btohqsg
Thanks for the clarity. So in order to enjoy the sing saver promo  we need to apply at bank branch right?,btohqsg
No. U need to click apply on the SingSaver promo then enter your email then SingSaver will send u an email n u follow the instructions in that email.Not at bank branch.,btohqsg
I cannot find that video again.  Rhb high yield saving can get 5.1%?  And hsbc EGA can get 4.3%  ?   Can someone advise me please?   üôè,btohqsg

Can Citi Premiermiles Card annual fees be waived?,btohqsg
They got no minimum spend to get automated waiver so see how it goes lor. It helps if you have only one Citi card  at most three,btohqsg
How do you sign up for gxs? I downloaded the app and clicked signup but it says invite only,btohqsg
usually easily to ask for waiver by speaking to cso,btohqsg
need to see invitation on Grab or Dash app,btohqsg
For the citibank card sign up bonus $300 with $500 spend  may I know if we can buy NTUC vouchers? Thank you.,btohqsg
Where does it show? On my dash for gxs account it just says coming soon...,btohqsg
I had that problem too  then I chatted GXS cust svc. So for Dash it looks like they want to see whether you are Singtel customer before the linkage is available.I recently switched to GOMO so my linkage option appeared in the dash app a few days aft I contacted GXS cust svc.,btohqsg
Has anyone tried if singtel dash virtual visa can be used on AXS?,btohqsg
any gd cards to use for singhealth insurance?,btohqsg
Probably not since singtel dash visa blocks topup transactions. you can't earn points using dash card anyways,btohqsg
I just notice my SC Smart card were use to pay skype fees in indonesia costinG INR70. Funny thing is i called to blocked the card and i blick the card in app but it still can be use on simplyGi.,btohqsg
What‚Äôs the best way to pay for insurance premiums especially great eastern? Usually I just pay via credit card thru AXS but realise no points or cashback..,btohqsg
Anyone else facing this error message on Dash? Cannot top up using credit card?,btohqsg
i think maybank platinum visa still can use for insurance,btohqsg
either HSBC EGA or maybank platinum visa,btohqsg
I thought dash virtual visa gets its funds from dash wallet  which accepts credit card topups? Yes  I'm aware that we don't get any rewards from dash topups.,btohqsg
Use the Maybank platinum visa thru AXS?,btohqsg
Hi I just set up my singtel recurring bill payment using my amex card. So they will start deducting my singtel bill on my next billing statement instead of my current billing statement?,btohqsg
yeah it work Platinum Visa for cashbackHorizon for Miles,btohqsg
I'm pretty sure they both exclude AXS transactions,btohqsg
Yes that's right. However dash blocks topup transactions  so there might be a chance that it might be blocked on AXS,btohqsg
Yes able to  have to go down to bank branch to apply  then they will manually confirm eligibility with singsaver. And have to get redemption form from singsaver as well. Quite troublesome but possible,btohqsg
Yes this is for the normal case  but the online offer doesn‚Äôt allow you to proceed if you already have a credit card  so it has to be overridden manually at the physical branch,btohqsg
Yes apply at bank branch  and ask them to manually confirm your eligibility for singsaver + ask singsaver to give you link to fill up a separate redemption form,btohqsg
Does UOB Absolute Cashback Card earn 1.7% on UOB$ merchants?,btohqsg
