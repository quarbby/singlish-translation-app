For OCBC 360  can the $500 spend come from debit card?,btohqsg
same i used the same method but it doesn't rlly bother me as my local spending on categories im KF card rarely goes above $1k.Travel and general spending lies on my Ladys and Privimiles,btohqsg
but u can just spread ur spending so u wont incur the 1% fee,btohqsg
Ocbc 360 websites did provide a list of cards that eligible for $500 spend. You may want to visit the website to see if the card you hold eligible for it..,btohqsg
Unfortunately they don't care for when you can do it. For Apr  they'll see your statement balance for Mar  which is based on 31 Mar. And the base interest (which gets deposited after FAST transfer cut-off timing) will also be part of Mar MAB since you can't transfer out on 31 Mar.,btohqsg
Sorry for the many qn haha. Can ask what‚Äôs the earning rate for lady‚Äôs card that is not the chosen categories? 0.4mpd?,btohqsg
Hi moomoo users  may I ask for my 5% fund plus yield coupon  do I just select any fund and will guaranteed the 5% return for the 10days? Is there anything i shd beware of when choosing?Since its guaranteed  shdnt i just choose the highest return fund (>10+%)  since its going to minimally earn me 5%? And at best case  earn me the 10+%?,btohqsg
Better than pay by cash üòâ,btohqsg
I just temp park at moomoo for 100k  withdraw on 7th April get $100.,btohqsg
Hi all. Thinking of signing up for moonoo (new user) for 6.8% sign up‚Ä¶ understand that the promo is over on 1 apr 2024 10pm  if i sign up today am i able to do in time? Any one familiar with how long the whole process takes of funding the account and putting into moomoo cahs plus?,btohqsg
I am curious why moomoo is the only platform that offers such attractive rewards compared to Webull and Tiger.ü§î,btohqsg
Have you read the TnC n check is it suitable to you?,btohqsg
Have read about the company  just abit uncertain about the custodian being not held with like UOB etc,btohqsg
Can search through the group chat to see what's the experience is like,btohqsg
Then u alrdy got ur answer. Invest directly with UOB üòä,btohqsg
How to participate?  I didnt receive this and also didn't see this in my account.,btohqsg
Does anyone know when they are giving the Cashback for the DBS takashimaya amex card? Made the min spend of $250 but didn't get the Cashback,btohqsg
I see! So what u mention means uob recognise the deposit of this month end's interest into their MAB and end balance subsequent computations. But any transfer you attempt will be futile (and is actually not recommended to do so for those whose EDB and MAB is a crucial criteria for bonuses) because it will not be recognised due to the non-working day.Please correct me if i am wrong.,btohqsg
Yes you can read UOB Stash account t&c on how it works,btohqsg
Thank you for the information!Lucky is only the base interest. Get stuck is not so heart pain. If its the bonus interest  few hundreds every month will stack up quite abit.,btohqsg
Hi can anyone explain how to maximise grab points without paying the monthly subscription? Like what's the difference between pay later and grabpay?,btohqsg
If you have cards like UOB One card then to maximise is not to top-up and pay with Grab Wallet / pay with Gray PayLater / any methods that earns you Grab points in one way or another..,btohqsg
Sorry  I don't understand. So.. don't top up what exactly? I do have UOB one card,btohqsg
You're losing a lot of cashback for your UOB One card if you're doing any of the above.,btohqsg
So just tick this option eh? For example 4776 is my UOB one card,btohqsg
Yes  remember that UOB One card gives up to 15% cashback for non Grab Wallet top-ups (including Grab PayLater).,btohqsg
Wah okay man.. yeah I've been doing that for the last 3 months. Thank you for the redirecton üëç,btohqsg
Very easy way is to check is realising your additional cashback for Grab is gone,btohqsg
How to check this? I don't think I've had any Grab cashback throughout the time I used it üòÇ,btohqsg
Track on excel? You should be tracking your spendings to make sure you don't end up not hitting the tiers,btohqsg
What tiers are you referring to? the UOB one $500 min spend or got some tiers to hit within grab?,btohqsg
Are you or are you not using the UOB One card? üòÖüòÖ,btohqsg
Ah ps.. let me try to share w you more details about my situationYes  I am using the UOB One Card.I am lucky that my lifestyle has no issues with hitting the tiers of crediting $1 600 salary and hitting a minimum spend of $500/mth thanks to my insurance and investment payments.My main motive of signing up with UOB was simply to get the interest which is a lot to me compared to POSB üòÇSo now I'm just trying to explore and see how to get other perks such as cashback  miles  etc.,btohqsg
Thks.  But I don't have any of those.,btohqsg
Like when you apply for UOB One card  you did check out how the cashback works right? üòÖ,btohqsg
I did but I did not pay much attention to the cash. Was more focused on checking whether my insurance/investment payments would be counted under the $500 min spend.I have checked it out on the website and understand better now. Thank you for your questions and redirection. Appreciate your time.,btohqsg
I think you're confusing all the different cards altogether...Are you using UOB One card or UOB One Debit card?Are you able to hit $500/$600withoutinsurance/investment/any non-eligible payments based on the different cards t&c?,btohqsg
I am using the UOB One Debit Card. At this juncture  yes I am still able to hit $500/$600 Min spend without the insurance/investment payments.,btohqsg
Hi  i opened a new uob one account on 5th of march and participated in the rising dragon. I put in $115k inside to maintain MAB of $100k.Just to double confirm  can i withdraw the 15k tmr? Just dont touch the base interest and the one account interest first right?,btohqsg
If you're able to hit consistent $500/$600 without insurance/investment payments  you can look into the UOB One card or UOB EVOL card for better cashback. Assuming you are eligible for these CCs.,btohqsg
You received the registration email for the participation of rising dragon of 100k right? Then yes  you can withdraw everything until 100k.Your EDB for 31 Dec is $0 since you opened on 5 Mar this year.,btohqsg
Ok.But i read someone saying ystd  just to play safe dont withdraw the base interest first. So only for exisiting account holders dont withdraw base interest is it?,btohqsg
Yes. You need to understand the logic behind why you should or should not withdraw... Not just see ppl say then copy  it might work out against you üòÖ,btohqsg
Ok haha thanks cos quite confusingü•π,btohqsg
The 100k should not be touched until it's earmarked  and I suggest don't withdraw the cash credit also (to play safe  even though I think people have withdrawn and nothing happened  and t&c said just participating amounts + EDB).,btohqsg
Noted Melvyn. I am looking to apply for one of the CCs too to build my credit score.If I'm not mistaken UOB ONE Credit Card has a minimum monthly spend of $2000 requirement which I cannot hit.For UOB Evol Credit Card  how can I maximise it?Considering UOB Lady's card too considering that it has no monthly spend requirementI see that there's some sign up offer on singsaver too üòÇ,btohqsg
cash credit is ok to withdraw..as long as keep to the TNC which says:Maintain 31 dec end of day balance + earmark amounts throughout the promo.,btohqsg
For UOB One card:https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/167432You can search YouTube for Chris' video on UOB One card vs UOB EVOL card.UOB Lady's card is a strong card if you choose to accumulate miles instead.,btohqsg
"""Till its earmarked"" - you mean start of earmark right?But how do i know when the ear marked has started? I dont see the 100k inside my account being greyed out.I did receive the confirmation email",btohqsg
https://t.me/HoneyMoneySG/163442Available Balance will be $100k less than Current Balance.,btohqsg
