Just like a girl friend   nothing is forever. But usually more items are added to a black list than removed.,btohqsg

If I participate in the uob national savings promotion and transfer 50k (fresh funds) into uob one account which has 1k at the moment  will I be able to accrue interest on the total sum of 51k in my uob one acc (assuming I fulfill monthly cc spend of $500 + crediting income)? Or will this 50k (that is earmarked  not reflected in the statement and cannot be withdrawn for 4 months accord to uob) not be considered in the monthly interest payout calculation for uob one acc?,btohqsg

If I recall correctly  for non-AMEX  is Maybank FC barcelona visa signature for 1.6% cashback on local currency. Can anyone else confirm? I don't see any exclusion in t&c.Miles card is not that great (0.4mpd) / high income required for 1.2 mpd+ :https://milelion.com/2023/06/03/whats-the-best-credit-card-for-paying-education-expenses-or-tuition-bills/,btohqsg

Since this news  which card are you using to buy air tickets and get at least 3miles per SGD with no limit  no matter the airline?,btohqsg
How do i check my moomoo 5.8% rewards. Its been 1 month since i topped up,btohqsg
If you are asking this question  I presume you are new to mile games. Accumulating miles to redeem air ticket is not as simple as just getting the highest mpd card. You need to understand your overall spending pattern across minimum two years. Some miles earned have expiry date. If you are unable to earn enough miles to redeem the air ticket before it expired  your effort will go into drains. There are some miles can be earned without expiry date but with lower earning rate.You may want to watch some videos related to miles from Honey Money first before starting your mile journey.https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&search_query=honey+money+sgGood luck to you.,btohqsg

Hi  sorry can anyone advise if I’m doing this the correct way? I deposited 10 in  but I’m not sure if it’s in cash plus  and I also have 5 bucks in funds  but in that tab  it shows number of positions in smart save (1)  is this supposed to be like this?,btohqsg
Which one should I be transferring the funds into? Would it be the fund portion?,btohqsg
One is in cash  one is already in funds. as long as you turned on smartsave  the cash will subscribe to the funds by next work day,btohqsg
Hi Chris  the cash portion won’t be reflected? Because I tried funding the 10 bucks two days ago.. how do I tell if the cash will subscribe to the funds by next work day?,btohqsg
"You can just manuually subscribe  under ""Funds"" > Cash Plus",btohqsg
Ohh okay so as long as I see $15 inside which is the amount I test buy  means it should be all subscribed to cash plus already right?,btohqsg
It's not excluded for singsaver rewards. But you are better off using it at points earning merchants because travel spend like flights are excluded from 10x points.,btohqsg
Yes this is moo moo account.. I just did a test first..,btohqsg
