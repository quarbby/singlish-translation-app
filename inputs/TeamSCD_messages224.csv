It's part of the wear and tear item list,btohqsg
Even metal warps but it takes awhile to warp,btohqsg
Plastic will warp in 8 to 10 years after millions of hot and cold cycles,btohqsg
time to spend more money on wear & tears,btohqsg

No idea man. It is a hit or miss. See the inspector's mood,btohqsg
Why only 1 wheel got camber,btohqsg
i change my rims & tyres & did alignment,btohqsg
the guy did everything swee swee then only 1 side of my wheel is out of the fenders,btohqsg
everything just nice except for this 🥹,btohqsg
Cos not supposed to have 1 wheel like that,btohqsg
U might wanna go to an alignment shop or what ask why is like that  issit an alignment issue or what,btohqsg
very slight  the rest of the wheels are just nice at the fenders there. then this one pop out slightly,btohqsg
Welcome to SCD  Send in a photo of your car for us to admire! We are 1 big family  no hate messages please! Enjoy your stay!*Do check pinned post for all the recent updates & events,btohqsg
hmm i think normal  i have noticed that on other cars too,btohqsg
need to start measuring underneath to rly find out tho😅,btohqsg
like 1 side out of the fenders?,btohqsg
time to go do alignment again to see what’s the issue i guess,btohqsg
yea or at least the axles not centred,btohqsg
think my car got slight discrepancy as well,btohqsg
but could be just where i park is not even ah 😂,btohqsg
bothers me a bit but not too glaring,btohqsg
but on that topic  mine both side poking like urs or a bit more so shd be fine hahaha,btohqsg
when i full right turning got some sound  coming from my front wheel also. the opp side of this wheel set. not sure if it’s the rim scrapping the caliper or what or is some joints actually fucked 🤡,btohqsg
someone got the same issue also. he say he damn lucky pass inspection cos the guy good mood. by right fail 🤷‍♂️,btohqsg
but if the difference for urs on both side too big  no harm checking 👍,btohqsg
Maybe give to mechanic to check. I would worry shits might happen like axle dropped out or drive shaft loosen,btohqsg
from the back angle my front also looks like that,btohqsg
planning on heading down tomorrow to go check asap,btohqsg
ahh for inspection shdnt be issue then,btohqsg
Like a grandpa aged toyota starlet,btohqsg
This is a cool small car. Actually wanted to get a Starlet.But I find it too small for modern family commitment.,btohqsg
The slightly newer starlets actually very big inside,btohqsg
Without modern safety features  the amount of space they can squeeze out is actually damn big,btohqsg
On the outside look smaller than a swift,btohqsg
some car look small on the outside but very spacious inside,btohqsg
The inside with boot space can fight a golf.,btohqsg
I not sure about how big the colt is tho,btohqsg
I see my friends fit full size bicycles,btohqsg
But front wheel removed of cus,btohqsg
u top down  can fit a tree,btohqsg
I know bigger than the old Starlet.Colt if want more space should go for Colt Plus Turbo. Colt Ver R is without butt so lesser space at the rear.,btohqsg
So when u say starlet small  when u drive colt i abit errr....,btohqsg
now Mit dont sell car anymore,btohqsg
But i'm team subie  so..  yay i guess? LOL,btohqsg
but the convertible colt look cute,btohqsg
i tot is render or what,btohqsg
it looks so funny  in a cute way,btohqsg
"is like colt saying ""i can be a miata too!""",btohqsg
but 100k in 2008 is damn expensive for tat car,btohqsg
i think mx5 also around that price,btohqsg
coe i think was like 10k only,btohqsg
wait for the 10 year cycle to drop,btohqsg
i bought when it drop to 26k,btohqsg
Colt CZC.We used to have a few in SG very long time ago  now I think no more already.,btohqsg
no. sounds like as if something is scratching/scrapping against the rims. yesterday when for check at other workshop they also dont know whats making that noise 🫠,btohqsg
Like if got weight then when go through humps  the car sinks and the tyre rubs against your car body.,btohqsg
Happens to mine  because got spacer.,btohqsg
Some say can because rubbing against banana leaf.,btohqsg
Go to a workshop that know Ur car model well,btohqsg
the mechanic say i need change the lower arm bushing cos its cmi but not confirm its the cause that making the sound,btohqsg
Any other workshop may just anyhow guess and change parts for you then end up you waste time and money.,btohqsg
I dun really like this type of trial n error😂,btohqsg
sadly my car not common already 🫠,btohqsg
As long got wear.on part...just change...not worth trying to split hairs too much😂,btohqsg
Uncommon cars abit more tricky to maintain as parts can be quite hard to source locally too,btohqsg
Just change. If got things wear  confirm will have other on the way de.,btohqsg
i think less then 6/7 in sg (?) so far only saw 1 other verna,btohqsg
Things that have impact on safety and drivability of the car  don't wait.,btohqsg
Dun take safety aspect too lightly😂,btohqsg
Depend on the sound could be anything from bushing to tie rod and even wheel bearing,btohqsg
guys those received my tele pm regards job in sg DO NOT CLICK.Is a spyware and i’ve fix it already.,btohqsg
