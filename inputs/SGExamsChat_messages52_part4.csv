Deemed reasonable? Pretty sure SEAB can internally set any grade mapping.,btohqsg
I don't think it's a contract.,btohqsg
All marks to letters are mappings.,btohqsg
hv to.. if not cambridge will not allow moe to use their name,btohqsg
Maybe during my time 5 yrs ago yes,btohqsg
But MOE said 2 yrs ago  bell curve doesnt exist for national exams,btohqsg
And ppl still believe theres a bell curveAmen rly,btohqsg
cutoff and bell curve work similarly,btohqsg
moe can decide proportion of stidents getting A/B,btohqsg
Cut off is based off raw expectations,btohqsg
Really dunno where this info come from but ok. As far as I can say CAMB means jackshit in terms of secondary and/or post-secondary education.,btohqsg
Bell curve is relative to cohort performance,btohqsg
U realise  proportion of A/B grades are never fixed,btohqsg
There was a year %A grades for H2 chem fell by 5-6%,btohqsg
it cannot be raw expectations if papers difficulty differ between yeats,btohqsg
And as long they hit the minimum  its an A,btohqsg
If the extremes are hit  SEAB will have to internally justify it,btohqsg
That raw minimum is basically the A1-F9 and A-U grade levels,btohqsg
aren't the percentages roughly similar each year,btohqsg
Is more or less the same,btohqsg
ya thats why its by percentage,btohqsg
Not just Cambridge but the DGEs should be aware why SEAB need to look at extremes.,btohqsg
I remember there was 1 year H1 GP was 25.8% A,btohqsg
Another year it was only 20.1% A,btohqsg
So it will never be a fixed proportion,btohqsg
ya cos they change the percentage every year,btohqsg
And why would they do that,btohqsg
Or else how you do you justify the % increase in pw As from 40% in 2000s to 56% nationally in recent years?,btohqsg
The process is very simpleStudent sits for exam ——-fly over to uk ——-> UK mark ——sent back beep boop ——> SEAB sees number. Decides what to do with number,btohqsg
theres a balance between cohort performance and individual scores,btohqsg
More students simply hit the minimum raw score  and hence get the grade,btohqsg
If i follow ur logic  then we are fucked  bell curve dictates all subjects to cap at 25% As,btohqsg
moe can change the minimum raw score,btohqsg
That’s like the activation energy thing,btohqsg
I wont see 50.7% As for H2 Math  but 25% As instead,btohqsg
its not a fixed proportion goddamit,btohqsg
Well yes  there will always be a proportion of people getting A and B,btohqsg
But the existence of a bell curve doesnt justify why do different subjects have such huge contrast in %As,btohqsg
but raw expectations are not fixed ether,btohqsg
Fitting to any distribution means A% is capped assuming no need for tie-breaking policies,btohqsg
a bell curve doesnt need to have its peak in the centre,btohqsg
No one said it has to B,btohqsg
Go on  this bio nerd is listening,btohqsg
....... Do you know what you are saying?,btohqsg
im just saying that bell curve tends to fix proportion of grades awarded,btohqsg
TheSingapore Examinations and Assessment Board(Abbreviation:SEAB;Chinese: 新加坡考试与评鉴局;Malay:Lembaga Peperiksaan Singapura) is astatutory boardunder theMinistry of Education(MOE) ofSingapore.,btohqsg
but the use of a minimum raw score  like 70 for A  60 for B helps u to get the grade instead,btohqsg
This feature is not specific to 'bell curves',btohqsg
just that this minimum raw score shifts occassionally,btohqsg
yea grade boundaries kind of does that,btohqsg
