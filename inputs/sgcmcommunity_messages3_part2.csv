Yeah that’s why all those Cat A EVs are so short in range. Becoz of smaller battery = smaller power.,btohqsg
Yeah but my road tax is 5300 a year then increase to 5600 next year   as a no emission car kinda too much,btohqsg
Yup ev is different from ice as the high end model got much better battery also,btohqsg
Not sure how to find a decently priced one in future. To be frank I feel Tesla’s entry model is still positioned as a luxury car in Singapore’s context.,btohqsg
Yeah but sg carmart put them under Normal sedan,btohqsg
Hang on sir! We're publishing it in 2 minutes,btohqsg

Where to find the 1st towing free?,btohqsg
We've informed TowMe. They will sort everyone out. Dont worry! You'll get the free tow as promised,btohqsg
EVs are inherently heavy due to battery. There are some ridiculous weights like the taycan. Useless totally.,btohqsg
Tesla remains the most popular. Nevermind about build quality and bugs this will get better over time. There’s a reason why it’s selling very well.,btohqsg
Latest update. TowMe will manually add the free tow for all 500 sign ups. Give them some time.,btohqsg
I help everyone ask their burning question. The free towing got expiry date? 😂,btohqsg
TowMe has informed us that the $60 credit will not expire until you use it.The free tow has a 1-year validity upon receiving the coupon.,btohqsg
anyone driving coed car here? do you renew coe at this sky high coe premiums,btohqsg
Forces owners to either scrap cars while still at it's prime or extend another 5 yrs,btohqsg
Depends what car bro.E.g.Lancer can scrapEVO can renew,btohqsg

E30 was one of the pretty reliable BMs  it will last long if maintained,btohqsg
If you're intending to sell your car  please pm me😬,btohqsg
