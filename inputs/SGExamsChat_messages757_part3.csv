Like 5 years down the road,btohqsg
But this I think most people 1 year realise alr,btohqsg
1-3 years of doing nothing still can recover ah,btohqsg
i think its becus he realises it now and just thinks its not worth trying anymore,btohqsg
That won’t phase him  when I say traumatic. I meant life changing,btohqsg
I have seen ppl 3rd class spam internships y3 and ended up cleaning up their act also,btohqsg
They say this but ultimately no doubt it is important,btohqsg
Nvm all these people are just enjoying temporary happiness  let them lorh. See how they enjoy years down the roadI also saw your convo about Tata  another one that is enjoying temporary happiness,btohqsg
It is easy to say this  but facing reality w it is another thing,btohqsg
They have to say something but can’t compromise the promise they made to the older generations (the very ones that built Singapore),btohqsg
But those that clean up act,btohqsg
what does the tuition industry have to do with wtv promise they made to the older generation,btohqsg
Cos the fuckup I see ppl do is party them get shit gpa in uni and not portfolio or internships,btohqsg
jun wei should be here but,btohqsg
i guess man is busy teaching,btohqsg
quality of study > time spend on studying,btohqsg
Rly depends on major and ur interest in it also,btohqsg
u can have ppl grinding the night before exam and score better than those started mugging since day 1,btohqsg
Oh those that I observed doing that is they rly heck care like project dun contribute etc,btohqsg
i seen people saying they study but what they actually doing is do one 1qn  scroll phone for 30 mins  den continue again,btohqsg
Not those zaikia vv smart mvr study party still 4.5,btohqsg
Like rly heck cate attitude alr,btohqsg
i had >10 extra curricular stuff between hall and campus,btohqsg
The older generations were promised a Singapore with a future generation that was way more educated then them which in turns promise these seniors a better life. Like so many policies of yesteryears  it was all like “candy” to reel in the voters.The govt was also the one that told its people hdb was going to be a value adding asset… th  eh promise that because they needed to win elections.,btohqsg
the top scorers that i know of in O lvl are like normal dudes  play sports and chill. not your typical nerdy mugger type,btohqsg
Your Ah gongs and ah Ma’s don’t see that,btohqsg
You say this but parents don’t think so either,btohqsg
Like they just play genshin or game 24/7 heck cate gpa or cca or hall,btohqsg
i mean yea i don't think it's a good idea too,btohqsg
they try to get a degree now then,btohqsg
The idea most parents have is just “do as much as possible”…they don’t actually define how much the child does but to many parents if the child don’t get to uni  they feel like they failed their child.,btohqsg
the one over performing got no time to complain,btohqsg
The child will never understand this feeling from the parents  the most thy can understand is filial piety in the form of doing well. But don’t actually understand how much it means to most parents to see their child get a uni degree,btohqsg
bro can i ask which uni u go ah,btohqsg
i mean if tuition helps then sure go for it but don't get scammed and understand your child if tuition isn't helping them then don't force them,btohqsg
None cause my parents ain’t a tiger parent,btohqsg
huh u need a tiger mom to go uni?,btohqsg
No you also need to be hardworking which I’m not,btohqsg
but u are hardworking enough to give so much inputs...,btohqsg
But I’m still getting by life real fine,btohqsg
Seems like alot of parents struggle to understand if the tuition actually helps,btohqsg
Esp when they hire sus tutors,btohqsg
wait are there legit ppl getting scam,btohqsg
You call this hardworking? I just call this my past time,btohqsg
idk paying ppl $100/h for them to sit thr babysit their kid do homework,btohqsg
some of the parents just want a reason to blame when their child fails the exams,btohqsg
u pay a uni student $20-30/h to babysit homework and help when they struggle,btohqsg
Y’all look up info on historical docu  watch shows…I accumulate info on random policies and political  societal reasonings etc…no diff then yall  if it mistaken then so be it,btohqsg
but make sure your kid gets value out of it la,btohqsg
and im saying all of these as someone with my parent being a tuition teacher  and genuinely providing tangible value,btohqsg
