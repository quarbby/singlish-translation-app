because they're the ones marking it,btohqsg
so if they think you should do something  but u nvr listen and do  then it might affect abit,btohqsg
Like for me they told me i just need to work on confidence,btohqsg
yeah if the lecturer think u bo chap in class  then they are likely to mark u down for daily grade,btohqsg
ur peers might downvote u for peer evaluation too if they dun like u,btohqsg
then u will have no problem,btohqsg
as long as you are hardworking  do ur stuff  and try to participate abit in class  u shld be fine,btohqsg
peer evaluation in my personal experience doesn't work very well,btohqsg
Being participative will give a impression to yr lecturers on how you are,btohqsg
cus my lecturers try not to be biased and base it off their own observations,btohqsg
even though our whole group downvote 1 guy for being an ass,btohqsg
he still contributed in the group activity and discussion,btohqsg
Basically the moral of the story is,btohqsg
Treat how you wanna be treated,btohqsg
Its best to have understanding grpmates!,btohqsg
Not ppl who bitch abt u when u did the most and treated them well,btohqsg
I have met ppl who are last minute who show attitude,btohqsg
like reveal their true colours at the end?,btohqsg
Okay so like for example  i was the grp leader for 1 project for example.,btohqsg
They do last min work  then over thr blame me when they dk what to do lor,btohqsg
my friend was telling me about his poly,btohqsg
Say i nvr help when i did help out,btohqsg
Then just because i go offline earlier 1 day cause i took covid swab and took meds so i was tired af.,btohqsg
They do work late at night i edit tmr also kenna scolded. They made a mass out of the work design,btohqsg
In the end A all claim credits for themselves ah,btohqsg
any nus peeps here can access NUS Exam Libraries?,btohqsg
Research or search wrong medical condition end up need to help cover their arses,btohqsg
U pin this message if u can bah hopefully someone will ans,btohqsg
So now i learnt i dn help them lor. Just do my own shit and just be with ppl who understand me ah,btohqsg
I personally never encountered anyone as bad as that  but I heard stories from friends,btohqsg
Then if u get higher gpa only u mess up 1 small issue,btohqsg
U do well get accused of cheating,btohqsg
I am just putting in work for myself now,btohqsg
I have a story about a bad lecturer in my course,btohqsg
he's very old  which is fine,btohqsg
Hopefully karma strikes back 1 day when they know abt ppl like thay,btohqsg
but the way he teaches is very outdated,btohqsg
and  he isn't updated with the new concepts of our industry,btohqsg
he was our module chair for Game Design Workshop,btohqsg
Sounds a bit like 1 of my teacher,btohqsg
most of the lessons are structured towards very outdated methodologies and concepts,btohqsg
and half the time when he's teaching  he doesn't know what he's talking about,btohqsg
and struggling to sound like he knows what he's doing,btohqsg
but that's not the bad part,btohqsg
all of it is tolerable  just annoying to deal with,btohqsg
For my FYP (stands for Final Year Project)  we're allowed to discuss and exchange the information for writing on logbook and reportHowever  only my team leader and I are doing the project seriouslyOne of my teammates went MIA until Tuesday  then realized that he only did both of them 40% done for eachAnother teammate also went MIA until Tuesday  but this more worse. Only did 10 pages of logbook and hasn't started doing the report yetIt's kinda stress because we have to show both report and logbook to our supervisor as soon as possible  but those two teammates don't do things seriously and hence we can't get the full information from themðŸ˜”,btohqsg
oh yeah and the games that he makes us reference in our assignment is from like the 60s -  early 00s,btohqsg
like if u reference mario  that's great and all,btohqsg
Oh yeah btw quick qn  some mf asking me for help but not work related. Should i just ghost?,btohqsg
I mean they would only be nice when they need shit,btohqsg
