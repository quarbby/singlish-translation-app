Even elliptical orbits are an approximation,btohqsg
Anyone got 2019 a math p1 and 2018 a math p1,btohqsg
There's also the divergence theorem and green's theorem,btohqsg
Divergence theorem is just Stoke's theorem applied to a scalar and 3D volume,btohqsg
Don't know and don't care. As long as I get good grades for an analysis course I'm happy. Because I hate those modules and do not wish to have anything to do with them in the future. Sorry.,btohqsg
I mean  thank you for letting me know. But I mean I would not care about it after taking such a module,btohqsg
Then why are you even taking the modules,btohqsg
Because it is compulsory for me  i.e. core modules,btohqsg
When it is optional then I simply avoid taking them,btohqsg
u nvr know when they will haunt u again,btohqsg
they are core mods for a reason,btohqsg
If they do  then I'll look at them in the future. If they don't  then I will not bother.It's not like I will suddenly forget everything,btohqsg
Clearly people like to chat more than studying,btohqsg
me and mochi gon panfry ur salmon brother,btohqsg
I will be eating salmon later,btohqsg
The meat of my friends tastes good,btohqsg
Hard sia the area under graph,btohqsg
Bruh I forgot how to integrate,btohqsg
ya lor I died on the speed,btohqsg
i was stuck at the kinematics part,btohqsg
Idk whether need to find k lol,btohqsg
I find all but never find where v is equal 0,btohqsg
U need to square both sides rite,btohqsg
Wouldnt they say constant to be found,btohqsg
It didn’t say in terms of k so pretty sure need,btohqsg
Yeah and both d2y/dx2 is 8 right,btohqsg
But how u all explain the m,btohqsg
Need to square both sides rite,btohqsg
I completely forgot how to do trigo,btohqsg
ya sia  Both angle A and B are acute idk sia,btohqsg
I just use opp hyp and adj,btohqsg
And got 4 as the other side,btohqsg
d last qn was beautiful tho no cap,btohqsg
What was the acceleration question answer? :0,btohqsg
How to get the m thou,btohqsg
Then I deduce it cannot be negative 4/5 since B larger than A,btohqsg
I got 300 plus its wrong,btohqsg
I got 222? But it was 3sf,btohqsg
What is the bell curve gonna be,btohqsg
Hopefully a steep decline to hell,btohqsg
No not so soon  normally is one hr after paper,btohqsg
HOW TO DO THE SHADED AREA QN?,btohqsg
Find the area under the curve between A and B then minus the square/rectangle,btohqsg
How many marks was yhat again,btohqsg
The -root3/2 minus the curve then integrate,btohqsg
wlao i minus so many marks alrd,btohqsg
got like surd and pi inside,btohqsg
idk i haven’t count but estimated like 10+ which is bad fr me la,btohqsg
My friends and i all got the same ans,btohqsg
Forgot the exact answer in pi but I remember in calculator it was 0.0 something,btohqsg
