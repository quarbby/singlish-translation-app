"I cant imagine ... he come out  no one know his past or him .. lead a normal life then date a girl .. then one day he emo and tell "" i hack a person to death  before hehehe "" wah scary !",btohqsg

If he really has recovered  and he has guilt  then the guilt stays. If he still can lead a life and provides stability and happiness to others  I dont see an issue,btohqsg
Honestly  ppl make mistakes. Will he recover? We never know.,btohqsg
If he feels guilty  he probably will wanna serve his full sentence and not wiggle his way out just because he has depression and his guilt is eating him alive inside lor,btohqsg
Recover is one thing relapse might occur,btohqsg
That is one thing not determined by us anymore.,btohqsg
Now this situation I'll just treat him the same way as how the courts and defense are treating him,btohqsg
