Guys  has anyone shipped something from SG to Europe? Im interested in buying rims here and send them to EU but from what I've seen shipping only 1 box üì¶ would cost like 450$ already. Is this for real ?,btohqsg
1 box 450 shipping only? Or is 450 inclusive of product,btohqsg
considering the size i wouldn‚Äôt be surprised,btohqsg
i spent like 50 shipping a fucking steering wheel so,btohqsg
Normally 4 rims shd be like 300 total bah,btohqsg
Yeah considering I buy the rims somewhere so excluding the rims of course.  Just shipping,btohqsg
Wah got try other shipping companies?,btohqsg
I just went on DHL and just ship to get an online quote based on the dimensions and quantity,btohqsg
1 rim 450 a bit much ah from what i rmb,btohqsg
I'll get u a screenshot real quick,btohqsg
But if 1 big box all 4 fit inside 450 is arnd normal price,btohqsg
Yeah unfortunately 450 is the price for 1 single box fitting only one rim,btohqsg
I just did another quote with more precise dimensions but x4 it would make 900+ $ which is almost twice the price of the rims I wanna get,btohqsg
Wait ah i send u the other shipping company i used before its significantly cheaper ah,btohqsg
But the thing is have to all put in one big box,btohqsg
It's fine either way as long as its a better price right,btohqsg

similar to sin ming   u go 833 motorsports can see r34   r32 gtr everytime,btohqsg
they covered up the mk4 supra because some kids like to touch,btohqsg
than got alot of handprints alr so they covered the supra,btohqsg
bro i fucking hate people who touch cars,btohqsg
and theres 2 fd rx7s that are also covered,btohqsg
both appeared on@cb_divisioninstagram because some people open the doors and take pics of the interior while their sitting inside of it,btohqsg
some sat on the bonnet then got buttprint ü§£,btohqsg
there are these kids who camp at milenia harrassing owners for rev,btohqsg
i posted the covered fd rx7 on my ig story quite long ago ( covered btw ) but the back cloth was open because of the wind and somebody accused me of touching it,btohqsg
no matter how strong yr temptations to touch the car   dont   because its not yours and respect other peoples property,btohqsg
i only do that if ik the owner lol,btohqsg
perks of living at ubi bro,btohqsg
ur not even allowed to remove part of the sheet?,btohqsg
even if the car is not covered dont touch it,btohqsg
especially if the car is covered   dont try to open,btohqsg
kb alr complined complains about carspotters touching / opening the car,btohqsg
white supra is at amk auto or carros,btohqsg
Car spotters also need to walk on the sides,btohqsg
A lot of them block the actual driving lanes,btohqsg
+ mk4 supra is not road legal,btohqsg
can own but not road legal,btohqsg
In a few years it will be under classic plate,btohqsg
best spots in kb for last year,btohqsg
if workers / staff ask what your doing or wtv etc   tell them yr taking photos for show etc   if they ask delete   delete,btohqsg
i had alot more pics but i was forced to delete because of privacy reasons,btohqsg
tb to when someone sat on huayra,btohqsg
but i can believe its 1200hp,btohqsg
But if im being honest it is possible,btohqsg
But 1200hp in sg? Cant really use it lmao,btohqsg
my dad said he knows his boss so he might pull up ans give me a ride,btohqsg
but any gtr or car thats above 1k hp is ws kept or home kept,btohqsg
like track car or garage queen,btohqsg
if he showed the engine bay and list the parts then i can believe,btohqsg
if not 1200hp im guessing 700+,btohqsg
lol i saw this the other day,btohqsg
I'm surprised his diffuser didn't scrape the hump,btohqsg
This Friday meet only jdm is it,btohqsg
Is it gonna be giant fr?,btohqsg
There‚Äôs more 1k Hp gtrs on the road than u think,btohqsg
I meant size of the meet üò≠,btohqsg
i mean its a isoaddiction meet so prolly,btohqsg
Do they usually gather cool cars  never been to a meet,btohqsg
only cool car in sg is the v8 corolla,btohqsg
what‚Äôs ur def of cool cars,btohqsg
Yea  I hope THIS ONE is there,btohqsg
obviously no chance of it coming,btohqsg
everday car meet at leng kee,btohqsg
Look what I found hiding behind the bushes today,btohqsg
sorry i haven't ship my car over,btohqsg
i letting my butler drive around,btohqsg
Well he went to the casino,btohqsg
"Wow what a great ""Evo"" üëèüëèüëè",btohqsg
wow   both pipes = 200 hp,btohqsg
Evo badge slant like rabz oni,btohqsg
Rear bumper not even painted üåö,btohqsg
as long as he doesnt bet the car away,btohqsg
There's no 918 on local plates because they're all,btohqsg
There's a few in storage at wearnes auto,btohqsg
But don't even try to go look it's a gated secure storage that's temp controlled,btohqsg
That car I sent is a Malaysian unit,btohqsg
Yeah it's VW group so you will find same engines,btohqsg
Best one is the Urus  Q7/Q8  Touareg  Cayenne üòÖ,btohqsg
Yes true   Bentley is VW group,btohqsg
Yo yall seen the new afghani supercar,btohqsg
The MLB Evo platform is actually used by many more cars,btohqsg
Q7  bentayga  A4  A5  A6  A8  a7  q5  q8  e-tron  Touareg  urus and Cayenne,btohqsg
Albeit it's slightly different variations of the platform,btohqsg
Anyone knows what that sign is,btohqsg
Ur stupid for assuming wat I mean,btohqsg
It has a good engine. If done right this car will for sure blow up in the market,btohqsg
Goddamn idiot  thinking I‚Äôm talking abt the car literally exploding ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
It says don't put AMG sticker on non AMG car,btohqsg
Same for M badge on non M sport packages and non-authentic BMW M cars,btohqsg
i feel M badge on msport kits shouldn't be there either,btohqsg
if factory dont have the M badge option then dont add,btohqsg
Even m badges on m sport cars,btohqsg
335 never came with M badges right,btohqsg
Some go put it at the grille and the middle designation where it isn't meant to be,btohqsg
There was no m sport back then,btohqsg
only 135 and 140 actually have M,btohqsg
M sport started with the F series,btohqsg
M series cars they call them,btohqsg
"But not m sport ""visual packs""",btohqsg
Which gives you a few badges,btohqsg
but then the new 340 is actually an M340i?,btohqsg
M series= m235i  m340i  x3 m40i  x4 m40i  m135i  m128ti  i4 m50  etc.,btohqsg
M sport is on all bmw models and is just a visual pack with different wheels  bumpers  a few badges and maybe m logo on the calipers,btohqsg
M series is actual higher performance cars with differences in dynamics and engine,btohqsg
And is the so called baby M,btohqsg
Not available in Singapore but it is a thing,btohqsg
not everyone is as free as u,btohqsg
This 86 damn quit no sign of engine roaring,btohqsg

To be that of all car guys,btohqsg
The stinger is a great car,btohqsg

except the escort and the murci,btohqsg
errr it's clean  but imo overdone,btohqsg
but this chat isn't for you to trauma dump like jem,btohqsg
B58 was the better choice  a much better engine platform that can be modded well and is reliable,btohqsg
So I can sell them away when I grow up,btohqsg
