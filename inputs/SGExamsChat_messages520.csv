Yes.. wonder what happen to the guy that mistook a male cow for female,btohqsg
To be far they also send a little boy too,btohqsg
He got the wrong white liquid that's for sure,btohqsg
reminds me lasat time that that RedBull energy there was ox sperm in the drink or something,btohqsg
wow that really bring out my age lol,btohqsg
I mean it was once isolated from bulls I think but that's about it,btohqsg
Like for redbull it's synthetic also side note the redbull we have is 2 different types,btohqsg
Got the Thai and the international version with the Thai one usually being cheaper,btohqsg
blue and white tin is the US one,btohqsg
the gold and red tin is from thailand or something,btohqsg
but no idea no copyright strike or something,btohqsg
Yep it came as a split long ago,btohqsg
unless they are the same company long ago,btohqsg
Na bro the red bull in Thailand sold the company the rights to use the name overseas and the formula,btohqsg
While they kept the name for use solely in Thailand,btohqsg
then the girls promoters that went in my school distributing Red Bull drinks (blue/grey) tins one told me it is a lie then,btohqsg
really missed those days were companies who go to my uni to do road show promotions and hype and give out freebies,btohqsg
The iconic red bull gives you wings is no longer the slogan as they kena sued,btohqsg
The good thing is you can sue anyone you want.The bad thing is you can sue anyone you... want....,btohqsg
"and that's how you get ""served""",btohqsg
Speaking of the 9/11 attacks freaking Bush and the CIA already had advance warning of the attacks like 6 months before it happened,btohqsg
When you learn the perpetrators used Malaysia‚Äôs airport security to judge America‚Äôs airport security,btohqsg
i remember also in 2010 there was a wave  like people was kneeling or sitting in the pledge,btohqsg
can open a facebook/twitter and share those its good lol,btohqsg
but then not sure u might get  cancelled lol,btohqsg
I mean I could submit them there,btohqsg
The onion has always been my favourite read,btohqsg
^some of these are brutal tho,btohqsg
i thought they were a youtube channel,btohqsg
Always been a website but then move to YouTube and now shorts as a additional thing,btohqsg
Read their amicus curiae brief it's bloody hilarious,btohqsg
there was a point in SG so advanced y'all use Prepaid cards for food. lol,btohqsg
why not just Debit and Credit cards lol,btohqsg
Cuz old ppl don't have it? In fact I keep my kopitiam card still cuz its nice,btohqsg
you guys haven't phased out Bank log books?,btohqsg
Huh? Tf is a bank log book? U mean passbooks?,btohqsg
A significant amount of old folks still use it,btohqsg
in malaysia  if your passbook ran out of space lol,btohqsg
I never converted my account personally to a digital one and my passbook is still active,btohqsg
they will just enforce the old folks to get a debit card lol,btohqsg
digital one just kept for 3 months record i believe,btohqsg
Some old folks don't even know how to use a phone in SG,btohqsg
if you want the whole history need to email to bank HQ lol,btohqsg
nevermind they will be gone in another 10-40 years lol,btohqsg
then eventually you will be become the boomer of their generaions lol,btohqsg
My bank just sent me my statement every month by mail for DBS and Email for OCBC,btohqsg
i don't get why they dont sent them in an excel sheet lol,btohqsg
should have this option instead of pdfs,btohqsg
well  idk i find excel sheets are more convenient for tracking if you wanna do edits,btohqsg
should be made free since spreadsheet on google is now a thing,btohqsg
Well u could easily export your PDF data to excel if u want,btohqsg
god bless Google and their open sourceness lol,btohqsg
most of the time it is a shitty export also the pdf is locked most of the time,btohqsg
Because Email could be unsecured or the intended recipient could be wrong,btohqsg
just store in a password zip ...,btohqsg
luckily winrar is officialy dead for Windows 11,btohqsg
Anways for tracking unless you are a business there is actually no need to do so personally,btohqsg
it being built in into windows after  2 decades,btohqsg
Then u gotta unzip the folder and then export it..,btohqsg
Na bro ill just stick to my paper statements and pdf statement,btohqsg
i honestly wonder the same thing,btohqsg
It wasn‚Äôt in the quote so no,btohqsg
So it's with them in Spirit? üòâ,btohqsg
I just wonder if I had enuf of jetstar how‚Äôs spirit,btohqsg
honestly idt ryanair is that bad atp,btohqsg
Hahaha there's a 10 dollar oxygen fee,btohqsg
Ryanair is there's a 10 dollar Gate fee,btohqsg
yeah he definitely has a lot of this,btohqsg
Dark humor is like food..Not everyone gets it,btohqsg
My ig one is the best tho,btohqsg
Ngl  but that was something I thought about for a long time alr,btohqsg
Idk if you caught everything but here you go,btohqsg
Hi guys am in Malaysia now how's it going,btohqsg
Apparently you need to be a teacher to get access to SEAB Cambridge exam board examiner report ?https://libfaqs.nie.edu.sg/faq/114584Anyone have clue on how to get access to the documents?The content should look something like this:https://leibniz-math.org/cambridge/a%20levels/9702%20past%20papers/2022/9702_m22_er.pdf,btohqsg
"""ig"" ? instagram? sorry im kinda old ... ._.",btohqsg
Someone asked about Malaysian STPM for Science Stream major.But you can see the numbers of Malaysian doing STEM is a down trend lol.,btohqsg
Has anyone here worked in a warehouse before,btohqsg
Like is there food there in a warehouse,btohqsg
Like a place to get food,btohqsg
üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ üíÄ,btohqsg
make sure to buy gum before going back to singapore,btohqsg
But then will you be fined,btohqsg
But I hardly find people chew gum nowadays lmao,btohqsg
Was trend in the 2000s as young punk culture kut,btohqsg
But now the YP term is now called GenZ ? üòÇ,btohqsg
my poly classmates literally all chewed gum in class a few weeks ago,btohqsg
As long they don‚Äôt stick it underneath the desk or seat ok edi,btohqsg
No one snitched and fine them üòÇ?,btohqsg
One of my friends brought 5 gum from Thailand,btohqsg
It was watermelon flavour and it was stimulating taste and smell,btohqsg
Btw where can I find altoids in sg,btohqsg
Where I worked we had a hawker nearby,btohqsg
Usually warehouses are situated within a industrial estate and industrial estates usually got Hawker centres,btohqsg
Usually got kopitiams nearby one with the usual Zi char and caipeng,btohqsg
Yep unless you see talking about Jurong island then that one idk,btohqsg
That one u need a pass to even get in bro and it should be the same just that it's called cafeteria or canteen there,btohqsg
And these Hawker centres usually lack variety,btohqsg
I mean that is what they call the airport ones,btohqsg
Do you take the North-South and East-West Lines regularly? New MRT trains on these lines will have more open spaces  large windows and ‚Äúergonomic perch seats‚Äù.https://cna.asia/42dRAYV,btohqsg
Gotta find@SMRTCEOto explain for us this new model,btohqsg
Idk probably can tell us the make and model what hp and how many carriages,btohqsg
all u need to know was this model was one of the last orders received by Bombardier (DT line) before they gt acquired by Alstom (NE/CC lines),btohqsg
Gonna know if it was retrofitted and the assembly of the carriage bro,btohqsg
Also did they change the interface system or is it intercompetitble,btohqsg
Also what are the track gauges,btohqsg
no. it ‚Äòs a new model assembled in China. the interface & track gauge is the same (1435mm),btohqsg
Wasn't it the same factory like I think Alstom bought over the Bombardier division for trains or smth,btohqsg
yes Alstom only carried on to fulfill this order,btohqsg
i thought you were referring to the laptop brand T^T,btohqsg
Interesting fact tho the HP company was spun off into 2 groups so the laptop division is in HP Inc with HP enterprise taking the server and business side,btohqsg
was discussing with a friend  and we came to the conclusion21k is the intake for 202066.9 k is the total enrolment from 2018 to 2020So technically  not 1/3 graduate from each batch but 1/3 of the enrolment graduate each year  which make sense since poly is a 3 years course,btohqsg
Here's the thing tho taking the numbers at absolute  the enrollment numbers for poly is decreasing and to a significant extend,btohqsg
YOY from 2020 to 2021 it is a 3137 drop in enrollment for polys,btohqsg
so give on take abt 1000 people across the 5 polys dont graduate when they join poly,btohqsg
The numbers point to something as well.. pre university as a whole has been decreasing enrollment numbers for like 6-7 years straight alr but uni numbers are going up,btohqsg
But it is still damn little tho.. for every 1 uni spot there is 4.18 graduates available to fill it,btohqsg
We come out of covid just for us to wear mask again,btohqsg
Weird question but do yall wash hair before going barber?,btohqsg
Need add money if u wash,btohqsg
I usually cut finish den wash,btohqsg
Who washes their hair before a haircut,btohqsg
I overheard someone from office side,btohqsg
He will wash coz he ps the girl handle dirty hair,btohqsg
they always spray bottle my hair,btohqsg
One up them don't wash for days before the cut,btohqsg
bro need to learn hot to not die..i need to learn how to study,btohqsg
meanwhile my classmates are in malaysia and europe on holiday,btohqsg
fyi  our exams are next week,btohqsg
Don't u pay 6k per year? Isn't it pay to win already or do u have to pay to unlock more DLCs?,btohqsg
i feel like im built like a tree,btohqsg
Hey don't be racist it Tyrone my homie,btohqsg
Wasn't that always off kilter alr?,btohqsg
No cap  my feet look like this,btohqsg
bro...you cant tell me it dont,btohqsg
legit looks like a tree root,btohqsg
No. I just don‚Äôt speak when I‚Äôm not spoken to.,btohqsg
1 paper cut is all I need,btohqsg
yea literally you can see my veins through my feet,btohqsg
meanwhile my gpa/grades no hope alr,btohqsg
Lanjiao u still in Y1 simi no hope,btohqsg
ima just enjoy poly life at this point,btohqsg
Fuck eh what's your GPA sia,btohqsg
How the fuck that takes skill commitment and sheer fucking will,btohqsg
i went for the diploma breifing  out of 127  i was part of a  group of 15 ppl below 2 gpa,btohqsg
I fail to see how any of those 2 words is gonna make a difference,btohqsg
nah...Just E both a MSA and ESE  that is all you need,btohqsg
And what a D for CA?,btohqsg
i never failed any of my modules,btohqsg
but most of it were D or D+,btohqsg
anyone who comes into contact w me dies,btohqsg
Because Pocoyo can‚Äôt die from someone that is harmless.,btohqsg
anyone who ever see me dies,btohqsg
nah my classmate has a gpa of 1.05  you can start guessing how,btohqsg
anyone i ever interact w wld die,btohqsg
So  everyone with a death wish should flock to you then?,btohqsg
Who knows maybe the sheer act of looking is enough to trigger harm,btohqsg
What just don't attend all the class and LOA for every single one,btohqsg
I call out the sheer ridiculousness of that sentiment.,btohqsg
If u failed u cannot even move to the next sem,btohqsg
there is 2 ppl in my diploma in y2 with below 1 gpa,btohqsg
Wait till u see my face it's bad enough to cause anyone serious harm with prolonged exposure,btohqsg
Either to cry and panic or to study idk which one tho,btohqsg
Everyone you live with shouldn‚Äôt exist on the mortal plane by your definition.,btohqsg
bro has no idea how far gone rp is,btohqsg
this year..they using kahoot for graded quizes,btohqsg
Yes I am like Medusa I have killed everyone I live with,btohqsg
like which poly uses kahoot to officially grade students?,btohqsg
Are you? You live barely on a mix of stress and suffering constantly since poly,btohqsg
I see that your sense of humor hasn‚Äôt improved yet. Why did I expect more from you?,btohqsg
Idk you should have expected disappointment from me after all that's what everyone does for me,btohqsg
He hallucinated seeing me somewhere as well so.,btohqsg
Maybe he just misses you that much,btohqsg
I rant to him about work every other week.,btohqsg
And you wonder why he sees you during his period of stress,btohqsg
Because I haven‚Äôt even met him before.,btohqsg
i have not felt stress since PSLE,btohqsg
like i legit think...i dont know what is stress/panick  i just go with the flow so much,btohqsg
That‚Äôs alarmingly concerning and not a good thing to flex about.,btohqsg
so far..ive been passing  and doing releatively well,btohqsg
If you see my sec school results  you would have never thought i would have made it to sec 5,btohqsg
Not something that is good to flex.,btohqsg
My Olevels brought me to ITE,btohqsg
N levels prelims i had 28,btohqsg
needless to say expectation for myself for n levels was literally likely ITE,btohqsg
My L1R4 was 32 for Os,btohqsg
dont get me wrong  i want to improve my gpa,btohqsg
but you are in rp and you know the system...tf am i suppose to do,btohqsg
U don't it's time u find another course to take,btohqsg
i legit cant think of another course lmao,btohqsg
there was a reason why i choosed the course im in  cause im the best at design out of everything else,btohqsg
Then what do u intend to with below 2 GPA,btohqsg
Fuck Idk even if SIM would accept u,btohqsg
finish poly  get diploma then zhao,btohqsg
my parents expectation for me as well,btohqsg
My parents expect me to get a degree from a AU,btohqsg
4 more years of hell here I go,btohqsg
Not for advanced credit lol gotta start at Y1 fresh,btohqsg
Which is painful cuz SIM not subsidised,btohqsg
i cant wait for term test to end next week,btohqsg
from what i understand most of my class has a average of 2.8,btohqsg
and i know someone with the same gpa as me,btohqsg
Most polys average GPA is 2.8 range,btohqsg
I mean you might be used to paying a kidney for school fees but most Singaporeans aren't üíÄ,btohqsg
Engineering the GPA is always lower,btohqsg
Even NUS and NTU help u by lowering the GPA required also,btohqsg
bro came to chem eng and cannot math,btohqsg
Then a part time degree might actually be more applicable,btohqsg
PT SUSS is cheaper from a Singaporean perspective,btohqsg
I mean he has a job to cover it but most don't wanna pay the high sticker price too.,btohqsg
Never said it wasn't I did Alevels and Poly concurrently,btohqsg
i think the reason why my parents expectation may not have much expectation on me is because of their backgrounds,btohqsg
both never finished secondary school  both dropped out of secondary 4,btohqsg
I never said it wasn't just that public sector a Public Uni is more advantageous,btohqsg
but now im from a average middle income household,btohqsg
My point is there is better alternatives in public unis instead,btohqsg
Even if he was a Os person,btohqsg
my father work till  16 called up for NS  entered srve as spf..came out work and save up moeny to get a private O and Private A degree,btohqsg
Public Unis most of the board don't give a shit which major,btohqsg
Diploma u go in at a lower level than Degree holders,btohqsg
My mother work and partied around till 21..started private O levels  graduated work till both my father and mother met at 25,btohqsg
And it's usually technician jobs for Diploma,btohqsg
Degree u get in at executive level,btohqsg
then...when i was around 5-6 yrs old  my mother's income improved cause she went for private A and degree,btohqsg
Yeah with the current world it's a death sentence,btohqsg
this was back in the 90s  a Degree was not common,btohqsg
Yeah then I gotta ask.. what's the relevance as its current times we are discussing?,btohqsg
if i wanted to  i can still find a way to create a life for myself,btohqsg
You could but ones prospects would be limited,btohqsg
but from what i understand the prospects being opened to ppl who have a degree...per say  does not intrest me whatsoever,btohqsg
I also knew a handful of them most went back to education,btohqsg
Yeah.. so what u wanna do lol?,btohqsg
^ probably easier for engineering but still it's hell,btohqsg
i have no idea..hence why im going with the flow,btohqsg
and see where it leads me,btohqsg
Yeah that's concerning to say the least tbh u gotta have at least a near term goal,btohqsg
But ngl it's not my problem,btohqsg
i mean that is getting a diploma,btohqsg
if you are talking about poor  ive been there,btohqsg
It isn't even a goal a near term goal is what to do immediately after,btohqsg
Cuz rn you have a high ass chance to get a Diploma it's almost set for u alr,btohqsg
uh get diploma serve my ns,btohqsg
then spend the 2 yrs and decide where i wanna go,btohqsg
You are not understanding my point are you. If its almost certain that event is gonna happen then there's no need to set a goal at that,btohqsg
i mean i do agree having a direction is important but what he said after of using the time in ns to figure it out isn‚Äôt invalid,btohqsg
the reason why i said ns is because  i always set my sights to serve the nation,btohqsg
True I guess but anyways it ain't my problem to worry on but in this case that would just be delaying rather than a goal,btohqsg
just want to see if im capable enough to continue after ns,btohqsg
You could consider signing on if u want,btohqsg
i mean i‚Äôve even advocated some of my mentees (esp female ones) to take a gap year if they really need it. some people just need more time to figure it out.,btohqsg
Yeah but in this case I won't consider taking a gap year a goal.,btohqsg
but the thing is i have yet to experience ns for myself to truly know if it suits me,btohqsg
just putting a name to it,btohqsg
i do like the notion of experiencing before committing tho,btohqsg
Yeah it is something to look forward to but I legit hesitate to call it a goal,btohqsg
Maybe it can be a place for one to explore what they truly want cuz I have had a significant amount of my friends take gap years too,btohqsg
like for me rn i don‚Äôt actually know what i‚Äôll be doing in 3 years time because it‚Äôs dependent on how i feel about things then  opportunities  and other circumstances,btohqsg
but i‚Äôve some potential options laid out,btohqsg
and i‚Äôm just exploring them rn,btohqsg
Yeah I was merely asking what where the potential options as having a vague goal in mind could prove advantageous as one would explore those areas in the gap year,btohqsg
yea and i think it‚Äôs better to take a gap year and know what you want instead of going for smth without knowing for sure and potentially regretting,btohqsg
person DAE'ed into Rp with a O levels score of 32,btohqsg
I am well aware of the DAE path. I DAEed in to RP biomed,btohqsg
im just surprise DAE has such a high threshold,btohqsg
Even my second attempt wasnt good enough for JAE and my EAE offer got revoked,btohqsg
i thought you must at least get a score below 30,btohqsg
I got 3 offers when I DAEed its showing your passion and interest,btohqsg
my friend DAE interview into one of TP's engineering course was just a google meet and answering 3 qns,btohqsg
Yes I never said it was showing them through the interview I said it was by your portfolio,btohqsg
bro did not even show anything,btohqsg
I was a concurrent student in a related course in ITE back then and that's why I got in.,btohqsg
Idk about your friend or others but that's how I showed passion,btohqsg
it was just that one lecturer asking a simple engineering connumdrum,btohqsg
Just simply holding a spot speaks a thousand words,btohqsg
you can imagine the surprise i got when he said he got in,btohqsg
I got a TP offer too I chose RP because they had biomed,btohqsg
That seems like a punishment ngl,btohqsg
i don‚Äôt even wanna be alive for 20 years more,btohqsg
Exactly life is pain.. idk why would anyone volunteer to extend it,btohqsg
if i can contribute one good thing to my research field,btohqsg
i think i‚Äôm ready to go,btohqsg
Hmm but what constitutes as good tho?,btohqsg
True but the winning mentality is always to continue,btohqsg
to me i guess if i publish a paper that‚Äôs highly cited,btohqsg
In a high impact journal I would imagine,btohqsg
if i can get smth in Nature,btohqsg
take 10 years of my life,btohqsg
Send me a copy when that happens pls >_<,btohqsg
trust me i‚Äôd be parading it to everyone i know,btohqsg
I left my mobile data on roaming üíÄ,btohqsg
It should be fine if you aren't overseas,btohqsg
I haven‚Äôt been studying dawg tf u on,btohqsg
afterall apparently for her all her assignments are group work or like assignments that have a very long due date,btohqsg
RP be like:today 23:59 take it or leave it,btohqsg
ive submitted work at 4am b4,btohqsg
cher still gave me a B,btohqsg
LEO won't even allow if it's pass deadline,btohqsg
Means your faci gave allowance la,btohqsg
no my assigment was marked late if i think that is what you were referring to,btohqsg
My faci recorded a video for us to revise on 2 days before the exam... and she uploaded at 4am,btohqsg
my dad just called prelim papers useless,btohqsg
More funny is that someone reacted like mins later,btohqsg
meanwhile my faci records motivational videos and post them to yt,btohqsg
Idk what u on about in SAS got modules that are just 2 classes in size and the only faci is also the module chair,btohqsg
sounds like SAS is run very differently than SOI,btohqsg
That's why our JAE point range lower than yours,btohqsg
Nice  anyways i nearly failed science during o levels,btohqsg
so not like...it was going to be anything i was going to go into,btohqsg
It's like a fluff contest for prelim papers,btohqsg
yes. our past assignments & the upcoming ones have always been 2359,btohqsg
sometimes  the lecturers in rp will extend the dateline,btohqsg
i can't tell if my dad is a dumbass or just ignorant,btohqsg
bc he claims that TYS/assesment book is superior,btohqsg
like mine right now  one has constantly extended the deadline by 1 day for the daily assignments,btohqsg
ive a classmate who transferred from rp and nyp (dae) and said that there are a shit ton of work to do,btohqsg
so there's a lot of homework for nyp,btohqsg
someone flaring up on Trip for trying to book a non-existent flight,btohqsg
My faci the one for 2 classes just fixed the issue by setting all submissions by that week on Sunday 23:59,btohqsg
that sounds like a terrible idea for people who procrastinate,btohqsg
Haha procrastinate for SAS? Good one,btohqsg
any Japanese friend can help me to translate some japan audio,btohqsg
Idk I don't understand jap too,btohqsg
The only Jap I ever learn was thru videos iykyk,btohqsg
Well I am listening to Kpop now so err,btohqsg
oh. so can differentiate kr vs jp,btohqsg
no. regional dialect oso don't sound like that,btohqsg
The pitch is also wrong for Tamil,btohqsg
I listen to KR songs for like 6-7 years? I think so I think I do know something,btohqsg
Idk you go ask SISTAR yourself la,btohqsg
The only Jap exposure I had was when KR artist sing JP ver and Perfume,btohqsg
Hahahaha only the OGs bro they where my gateway to kpop but idk of the timing so I just use their disbandment as a mark lor,btohqsg
That was meant to be a joke in reference to the other videos,btohqsg
What wonder girls isit limpei too young for that shit,btohqsg
definitely sound like a market setting in india,btohqsg
The time of Gee Gee too,btohqsg
dang 2011...a decade has alr passed,btohqsg
that one is one of the first gen modern k-idols,btohqsg
the transformation of japan from this was remarklable,btohqsg
Exactly I too young for first gen but I went in with second gen,btohqsg
i rmb watching the news in p1...seeing the tsunami destruction,btohqsg
Sistar Miss A gawd damn I am old also,btohqsg
i rmb u could fly singapore airlines to japan for $600+ that time,btohqsg
U wan learn this u go take H2 History,btohqsg
I can write an entire essay on the Han economic miracle and the Japanese Economic Miracle,btohqsg
learnt alot from the internet over the years alr,btohqsg
internet is a treasure trove of knowledge,btohqsg
That's why u need a syllabus to direct you where to go.,btohqsg
they learnt alot from this disaster about earthquakes,btohqsg
But they had yet to learn much from preparations from a tsunami's until the 2011 disaster,btohqsg
U wanna learn the history of modern Japan u start at the great Kanto earthquake first and the events that led to it,btohqsg
From there u can go back to the Meji Restoration and increasing militarism,btohqsg
Or forward to WW2 and subsequent events,btohqsg
Im intrested in disasters if you cant tell by now,btohqsg
not really intrested in recovery from one,btohqsg
It only used like 0.1 gb or smt,btohqsg
Well then the teleco wil charge you to going rate,btohqsg
that was the reason why one of the banks whom qe2 counts as one of the customers collapsed cuz that guy bought jp stocks @ that point,btohqsg
I have no idea what u referring to?,btohqsg
Rn finally at the hotel so using the wifi,btohqsg
Kl is like sg without the high population density,btohqsg
If u wanna talk about Modern Japanese Economic policy u have to go back to the 1980s during the boom and the subsequent Plaza Accords along with understanding the trade relation of the US and JP,btohqsg
better story than Korea. Korea ‚Äòs 80s was chaotic,btohqsg
u heard abt a high end department store collapse caused by a corrupted businessman?,btohqsg
Koreas han miracle is more condensed tho just need to read during the period of Park Chung Hee's Rule can liao,btohqsg
I went to a Shinsegae that had alm the same pillar design but stronger,btohqsg
The design is alright lol its just they dumb and build an extra floor and on that floor and add more weight,btohqsg
Wasn't it not lesser number but thinner pillars something about the owner wan more floor space,btohqsg
I bet you got A* for the racism module,btohqsg
Bedok ah how many days since you last said the n word,btohqsg
Bro the way you type u gonna expose yourself very soon to Bedok,btohqsg
Not rlly tbh but its fun to keep you guessing,btohqsg
You ASA very free one anyways,btohqsg
Bro how many times u wanna repeat that arh ik you salty la but still,btohqsg
maybe i should  did abit alr,btohqsg
I wanted to talk this quiet person,btohqsg
Ehh bro why you so quiet,btohqsg
then he replied cos I am introvert,btohqsg
Was it just a random stranger?,btohqsg
Ah.. honestly even at my work I keep quiet one :/,btohqsg
my part time job had a guy like this  told me he was kicked out from ns,btohqsg
for being too destructive during NS,btohqsg
I TELLING MY S4 THAT EVERYDAY,btohqsg
No i meant like why differentiate gender for this question,btohqsg

When i work with him..he acted like a primary school  kid,btohqsg
i shout ord lo everyday in office,btohqsg
am i a pri sch kid,btohqsg
keep on wanting to  jump in the trolleys..and tell me to push him around,btohqsg
i think i deserve pes f,btohqsg
if not bro is randomly grabbing ppl and falling to the ground,btohqsg
Let's just say one doesn't deserve any pes status,btohqsg
It's kinda assigned to you.. for most ppl its out of their hands,btohqsg
lol uk the only reason i didnt pes f,btohqsg
is cos i had too little foresight,btohqsg
then when i thought of pes f its alr too late i finish bmt alr,btohqsg
Aren't u alr friends with the Medic on tekong liao,btohqsg
from my pov  pes f pros > cons b4 enlistment,btohqsg
So what.. am I considered a pro..,btohqsg
Just let him pes f ah,btohqsg
I put NB cuz I didn't understand the nomenclature,btohqsg
Lanjiao why do I feel like this question is targeted at me,btohqsg
passenger train collide with a goods train,btohqsg
uk i put good for them alr,btohqsg
i have 5 months left to farm,btohqsg
Their roads have a higher death toll daily tho its legit merely a statistic at this point,btohqsg
I wanted to get my eyes and teeth done in there,btohqsg
Not statistic but for context imagine in sg everyone in one train die or an entire school popln die,btohqsg
Why u always ask that qn,btohqsg
I don't mean to be an ass but err..Are u seriously comparing a single Indian life equally to a Singaporean life?,btohqsg
Bro i going next month what talking u,btohqsg
Yeah that's not how the world works.. just look at who built the building in front of you can liao,btohqsg
I tot to enter uni one has gotta discharge all their NS obligations,btohqsg
Just get to the point bro,btohqsg
Why yall talking so seriously about life haha,btohqsg
My point is in the economic system a human life is worth more in singapore than in india,btohqsg
I would rather not go both,btohqsg
But u do have to serve both right?,btohqsg
Oh.. so u choose SG Ns?,btohqsg
Cuz I heard u can enter anytime one,btohqsg
Not singaporean or pr so im not serving haha,btohqsg
Walao eh@chemcerwhere u get the idea he SGPR?,btohqsg
Korea Ns more Fd up than SG ns I think,btohqsg
But u can choose when u wanna enter tho,btohqsg
If u can choose SG or Korea one I would say do SG one,btohqsg
Jangbijju for the win with New Recruit,btohqsg
Not only that  SG citizenship (in my opinion) more value than Korean citizenship,btohqsg
What if your family on that train?,btohqsg
but they are worth 2 dollars so they deserve to die right?,btohqsg
Then personally I would feel sad but if my family was on thay train it's gonna be a massive international incident,btohqsg
Unless u rly want to be soldier no point.The salary doesn‚Äôt matter cos economic conditions in Korea to get same pay is work so much harder  not worth. Toxic work culture,btohqsg
Yeah I was under the impression it's like damn low,btohqsg
Why doesnt matter tho 4 sgprn only,btohqsg
It matters lol cuz it will affect the entire tourism sector of india,btohqsg
That one in 5 yrs maybe,btohqsg
That's the power of Foreigners being injured,btohqsg
It is not whether i want or dw leh. Im not sg or pr,btohqsg
cmon lah have some sympathy ah,btohqsg
Lemme just make this clear if a Singaporean was in that train we would be hearing the news nonstop 24/7 liao,btohqsg
Can you apply to do Ns and then PR guaranteed or smth?,btohqsg
same ahfor me at school im always rather quiet and introvertedbut when i see other people in my class that are vv quiet i will go up to them and say hi,btohqsg
I do personally it's sad but the world simply works this way,btohqsg
Some ppl love the country or feel long term they wanna be at home it‚Äôs ok,btohqsg
Korea cannot dual citizenship means he gave up on being singaporean ig,btohqsg
Lanjiao then the wars we have for fun and die for fun one isit,btohqsg
you ownself say some random straw man fallacies then say the world works this way,btohqsg
But if you came here young and speak little Korean no point you back ba,btohqsg
Idk what's btr. Stuck in cs or going army,btohqsg
and look like idiot marching arnd the parade square,btohqsg
But he gotta renounce KR citizenship cuz I think got age cap one,btohqsg
He should consider this if he got not ties or love for Korea,btohqsg
No need but he need to go back korea either ways to serve,btohqsg
You PR here no need renounce Korea citizenship cos Pr is not citizen what,btohqsg
Ya sia i cannot go outside for 6weeks tf,btohqsg
But I don't understand the question yall are making tho,btohqsg
Ok yea but u have to serve 4 yrs or u might end up becoming a refugee,btohqsg
Either ways also he need to go back what,btohqsg
Best is if he get PR here after NS age then don‚Äôt serve stay here forever marry Singaporean no service to either country lmao,btohqsg
It's 2 years he needs to serve either ways,btohqsg
Optimal path set out alr if you don‚Äôt want to serve anywhere,btohqsg
Since pr is not citizenship  u basically become countryless,btohqsg
Yeah the Korean government will not even allow u to renounce if u don't already have a citizenship elsewhere,btohqsg
No I meant you saying certain nationality‚Äôs life is worth less is your personal opinion. Other than lets say hitler no one shares you belief its not world wide,btohqsg
Korean citizenship can be revoked if you don‚Äôt show up to serve Korean NS?,btohqsg
Like it's physically not possible cuz being stateless is a pain,btohqsg
U will go to jail lol,btohqsg
Is only u kenna jail if u go back,btohqsg
So just don‚Äôt go back Lor,btohqsg
Ppl shit on u in society for not going army one,btohqsg
It is worth less I don't understand what are trying to say or argue here?,btohqsg
That a worker in India earns more than in Singapore?,btohqsg
Here‚Äôs your game plan if you wanna Siam all lmaoApply PR in SG after 21  get alr  get married to Singaporean  buy a flat and live here forever. Forget Korea,btohqsg
For Singaporeans need to learn Korean to do this in reverse xd,btohqsg
What age then not kicked in,btohqsg
So in another life u wanna be born in Singapore or India,btohqsg
Cannot be so high  I think there‚Äôs a lot of Malaysian Pr men who also didn‚Äôt serve Ns they in their 20s also,btohqsg
rather be a rich indian than a poor sgprn,btohqsg
U have no idea bro so many,btohqsg
Yes it does from a humanitarian stand point u tell me with your moral highground but when the chips are down in the end everyone will choose the economical solution,btohqsg
They first work here under EP two years then become Pr,btohqsg
Most of them become Pr within 2 years,btohqsg
Mostly IT roles cause short of supply,btohqsg
A lot of Malaysian become pr through this route,btohqsg
Basically saying richer ppl life worth more,btohqsg
Because it literally is worth more from a quantitive perspective,btohqsg
Curious ah what age groups r u guys in to have such a conversation,btohqsg
It's a age group mess in here,btohqsg
I mean I didn't I was just making a point,btohqsg

Damn I actually do kind of want to know but not so much  its a bit too weird alr,btohqsg

Oh holy grail is a discord group?,btohqsg
It's kinda appropriate cuz Netflix Originals these days suck ass,btohqsg
