thank you for the affirmation <3,btohqsg
Just now we were talking about discrimination towards rp right,btohqsg
I actually need to learn how to pose for pgotos,btohqsg
I know poly last time was looked down,btohqsg
Like poly was a second choice,btohqsg
And jc was the first choice,btohqsg
My mom wanted me to go to jcðŸ’€,btohqsg
yeah but I saw cop in 2015.. lowest cop was 17 eh.. thatâ€™s very high compared to now 20..,btohqsg
my parents wanted me go poly but i aimed for jc score,btohqsg
so i surprised them for results,btohqsg
The reason why rp is so looked down upon is due to many factors that unfortunately allign to form this imageâ€¦,btohqsg
Itâ€™s not only because of the Rjâ€™s and ungraded internshipsâ€¦but when it was first formed as a polytechnicâ€¦there was no campus,btohqsg
The pioneering batch of rp students from 2002 studied at a former government building,btohqsg
I wanna see the Jae booklet in 2000,btohqsg
I didnâ€™t go bvz of location and rj,btohqsg
Apparently the students were using the campus of moeâ€™s own headquarters,btohqsg
Rp operated out of the former moeâ€™s headquarters from2003-2005,btohqsg
Then officially moved to its current campus in 2005,btohqsg
dang u know ur sch history,btohqsg
I only know i have a fountain,btohqsg
As such you can see why people would not think very highly of rp considering it was like some prank the government pulled,btohqsg
Damn I feel bad for her,btohqsg
Like if you were to tell the public that there is a new polytechnicâ€¦but the students had no campusâ€¦.did not even have a management communityâ€¦do you think it would have went well with the public?,btohqsg
ok so that wasnâ€™t normal in 2010s..,btohqsg
That is so long ago lmao dang,btohqsg
