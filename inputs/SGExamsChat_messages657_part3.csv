"ok so basically today was the first formal lesson for h2 math and like the lecture notes + tut was given to us last weeka good portion of us incl me had alr watched the sls lectures  filled in lecture notes/tutorial etc before todays lecture (tbh today is the first lecture so theres no harm in starting today la) but i did go through the lecture beforehand since i already know all the concepts and started on the tutorial (didnt watch sls vids cause i prefer to read myself). i have a habit of prereading for stem subjs like math and bio before the lessons themselves  and i usually do the math example qns before teacher goes through  this isnt a new habit btw its something ive been doing since like y2so today teacher asked us who alr started and alot of ppl raised hand then teacher say its good that ppl took initiative. then i overheard a jae girl be like "" wtf why they started studying so early  its so weird "" smth along those lines",btohqsg
