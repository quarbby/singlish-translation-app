Fantastic idea. Sending this to my bosses HAHA,btohqsg
No la  i'm sure u guys are saavy enough to find out,btohqsg
If you stock semi slicks maybe January I buy üòÇ,btohqsg
I think it‚Äôs ok to make a loss initially to make ppl join,btohqsg
Swee.. we're definitely looking to work with suppliers to get more tyres,btohqsg
Like how grab used to loan billions of funds to burn but is a listed company now,btohqsg
Buy a few to keep ah,btohqsg
Nope. I anticipate my semi slicks to be Botak by Jan LOL,btohqsg
Actually shud we buy from sgcm? Cus for now it doesnt come w balancing n tyre rotation right  just installation of tyres ü§£ü§£,btohqsg
Balancing should come as a standard leh for new tires,btohqsg
Hahaha I definitely don‚Äôt. If I go out to patch  I have to pay $8-10 each time and work requires me to drive into industrial areas  this is a huge bonus for me. Rotation also costs $15-20 so these things do add up in the long run actually,btohqsg
Yeah  seems to be the case at the moment! But one thing really great about the SGCM platform is that for installation  they have various workshops at different locations so convenience is pretty good. I currently only see maybe 3-4 different shops? If they can expand to pull more tyre shops to jump on board  that could be pretty interesting,btohqsg
This is fantastic as well. And if SGCM can somehow tie all the partner tyre workshops together so this membership thing works across all shops  I feel SGCM could potentially become the one stop for all tyre needs islandwide.I can change my tyres in the east and purchase this add on membership (better if it‚Äôs free when purchasing tyres hahaha)  have a puncture in the west and conveniently go to a west workshop to get it patched.,btohqsg
Ya man the tyre industry needs a shakeup,btohqsg
I kinda already decided to go with Pitstop tyres for my next change because they have all these benefits when I go with them even though I‚Äôm paying $25 more per tyre. The cheaper workshop will charge me additional $60 for balancing so honestly  the difference is only $40. And I still get free rotation  balancing  patching up & nitrogen fill with PT.,btohqsg
Only downside is with patching up  I need to drive down to their workshop to enjoy the free services so if SGCM could tackle this  users can enjoy convenience no matter where they are on the island. And if I have to pay an additional fee for this islandwide convenience  I think it‚Äôs still pretty worthwhile.,btohqsg
I changed my tyres at pit stop. The boss and his daughter are really nice and genuine.,btohqsg
I repaired kerb rash at pit stop before  edmund very good at what he does haha,btohqsg
Lol that should be the way ma  being nice to paying customers,btohqsg
Got some hor‚Ä¶ paying customer the boss also treat them like üí©,btohqsg

Left pocket / Right pocket...same person,btohqsg
GG means if really cannot afford BTO...buy a Sienta?,btohqsg
You'll only own it for 10 yrs tho. BTO is much longer. So you can decide. lol,btohqsg
"ok ma every 10 years change ""house"" like flipping flats",btohqsg
Incorrect way of thinking. Cost of BTO last for...say 70 years. Car (if same as cost of BTO) only last 10 years. Naturally getting a BTO is a better choice. No extra expenses every 10 years,btohqsg
