hi guys  new lalamove driver here  i did my first couple of deliveries earlier today.i took a bulk order with 7 drop-offs (from west to east  final location was close to home thatâ€™s why i took it) for $51 after commission â€” averaging about $7.3 per drop-off. this order took about 2.5hrs to complete.do you guys normally take bulk orders like this? would it be more profitable to take smaller orders? please share your insights  thank you so much!,btohqsg
I took. But was cautious. The fella seemed desperate and pushy. Canâ€™t get through the number tho. So cancelled.,btohqsg
2.5hrs for $51  starting is good and in terms of hours  just nice. I always target $20/hr so it seems more profitable.,btohqsg
Or point A to point B = $20 (Iâ€™m a car),btohqsg
Yes thatâ€™s what he did. So I refused to go over. Then he urged me to just go over there are people there. Forwarded the whole thing to CS.,btohqsg
