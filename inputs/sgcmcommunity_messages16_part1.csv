https://www.wheels.ca/reviews/buying-used-2017-2020-alfa-romeo-giuliaTo understand where Alfa Romeo is coming from requires a little history. In 1967  the company sought funds from the Italian government to build its affordable front-wheel-drive Alfasud  but politics intervened  and the money came with strings: the new factory had to situated in the poor south of Italy.While well-intentioned  the government edict saddled Alfa with workers who were seemingly unqualified. Frequent strikes in the 1970s ground production to a halt. Workers refused to apply primer to car bodies because of health concerns. That  combined with cheaper steel sourced from Russia  sealed the carsâ€™ repute for rusting away.Add to that the litany of broken welds  bad fuel pumps  faulty electrics and overheated  leaky engines and Alfa Romeoâ€™s reputation was cast. When Fiat Chrysler (now Stellantis) brought Alfa back to North America in 2017  Alfisti prayed that things had changed.,btohqsg

ig giulias can be had for less than 100k it is a great buy. switch,btohqsg
giulia veloce 5 years for less than 100k. wow,btohqsg
the many internal politics within alfa ruined them for so many years from making proper sports cars that rival bmw mercees. until the giulia.,btohqsg
after alfa 75 which is a real enthusiast's car  alfa did a half hearted job of king frotn wheel cars to save money.,btohqsg
see in america  all over they love tesla,btohqsg
Giulia gearbox should be more stable than its predecessor,btohqsg
true. that is the only serious front drive cars that has won races,btohqsg
zf automatics like bmw has chosen. 8 speed really solid ones,btohqsg
Giulia is the proper machine that brings back alfa.,btohqsg
