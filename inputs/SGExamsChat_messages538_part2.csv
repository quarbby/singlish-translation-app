Hahaha probably not  more likely to be net negative,btohqsg
i honestly need parents like that...cause i literally had no direction in life,btohqsg
Close shop alr  I think 3 is more than enough right,btohqsg
my parents never put any pressure for me to do well..so i literally did the bare minimum,btohqsg
Or got chance still one more,btohqsg

I think about marriage itself alr stress  donâ€™t talk about kids,btohqsg

their parenting style for my brother changed so i can see how the effects of both parenting style affected each of me and brother's life,btohqsg
idk if i said before  i dont request anything from them either,btohqsg
My personal experience with life teaches me that marriages have high variance  so I donâ€™t want to engage with it tbh,btohqsg
"to me i feel like i dont ""suck at things""..like im actually decent",btohqsg
I also havenâ€™t ever felt like I would die for someone so itâ€™s like  it sounds like I havenâ€™t yet achieved full emotional maturity lol,btohqsg
It shouldn't be about feeling like you want to die for someone. That's too drama,btohqsg
no that is my parent's expectation..for me it was basically do the best i can,btohqsg
Also never feel like when I look at another person that wow we really should make some babies,btohqsg
It's okay  aromantic asexual people still get married too,btohqsg
I'll see it as  this is someone I can live with and talk a lot too for the next 50 - 60 years,btohqsg
Well maybe not die  but I think I learned to be a bit too calculative  and I think itâ€™s not right. Wouldnâ€™t want to marry until I can see the world more holistically,btohqsg
no im legit thinking..but i right now dont even know what i want to do in my future..let alone what events i could join in school etc..to help aid me in the journey to discovering my future industry ill be keen to work in,btohqsg
Maybe  but I wouldnâ€™t want someone who is married to me to do it to me  so Iâ€™m working on myself first lol  so I donâ€™t do it to others.,btohqsg
