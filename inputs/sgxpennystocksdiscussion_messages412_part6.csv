Green packet. Market open tmr green,btohqsg
When you use the term 'boss'  are your referring to the position of a hegemon in a unilateral world order like that one we are in today ?,btohqsg
Because I dont see China aiming for that  she seems to be pushing for a multi polar world direction.,btohqsg
But to look intelligentYa I agree with u,btohqsg
I always hear people claiming China wanting to replace US,btohqsg
Yet I dont see how China could do so.,btohqsg

Her(China) position and size relative to the world will never be as imposing as compared to how US was right after the end of WW2  when her GDP and manufacturing capacity was almost half of the world  thus allowing her to set up the Bretton Woods system.,btohqsg
I summarised for those who don‚Äôt understandAm jin dk,btohqsg

"Another way I personally see is that globalisation under UN is pushing the world into a multi-polar order  something US is unwilling to continue further since it diminishes her primacy  thus for the past decade we are see US trying several way to sabotage several multilateral institutions like the WTO and UN  now they are advocating a new ""rule-based"" world order who rules are set solely by ""demoracies"" aka US and her close allies.",btohqsg

Taiwan Stock Crash Shows World Dangers of Too Much Leverage1. Few things evoke fear in equity markets like a margin call. On Wednesday that fear turned into panic in Taiwan  offering another warning for the world on what can happen when leverage unwinds. The trading day started out quiet in Taipei‚Äôs $2 trillion stock bourse. But before the morning was over  the local benchmark index had plummeted almost 9% in the worst one-day performance in its 54-year history.2. On a smaller scale  the same happened in Taiwan. Armed with conviction  and with history on their side  investors took on increasing amounts of leverage. The result was a 46% expansion in margin debt this year to about NT$274 billion ($9.8 billion) two weeks ago  the highest since 2011. By comparison  the Taiwan benchmark was up just 19% in that period  an indication that people were taking out loans faster than stocks were appreciating.3. Local investors had little reason to fear losses. Taiwan‚Äôs economy became one of the biggest winners from U.S.-China rivalry. Its chipmakers flourished as Washington sought to hobble Beijing‚Äôs efforts to build a domestic chip industry. During President Donald Trump‚Äôs four-year term  the Taiex benchmark became the world‚Äôs best performing stock gauge  gaining more than 90% in U.S. dollar terms.4. The euphoria began to unravel this week as the threat of inflation sank the Nasdaq  with tech stocks around the world following suit. As the Taiex slid 3.8% on Tuesday in Taiwan  the level of margin debt fell by NT$12.6 billion  the most since October 2018. That suggests traders faced margin calls by brokers to cover losses in their stock accounts.5. Wednesday‚Äôs record rout is likely to have spurred a bigger unwinding of leverage. (Comparatives are skewed by the widening of daily price limits for individual stocks in 2015.) ‚ÄúMargin trading boosted the Taiex over the past few months  which may add to declines if they face margin calls ‚Äù said MasterLink Securities Investment Advisory President Paul Cheng.,btohqsg
