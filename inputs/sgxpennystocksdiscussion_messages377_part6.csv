Construction firms prepare for prolonged manpower crunch1. FIRMS in the built-environment sector are bemoaning a protracted manpower crunch with the news on Monday that travellers from India - a key source of labour - will face tighter border measures.2. The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that Singapore will tighten border measures for travellers from India by reducing entry approvals for non-Singapore Citizens/ Permanent Residents.3. Meanwhile  local businesses with operations in India or which rely on foreign labour from the country may feel the pinch first. In response to queries from The Business Times  Singapore Business Federation (SBF) chief executive Lam Yi Young said the federation is in touch with Singapore companies with operations in India  but has not received requests for assistance linked to the New Delhi lockdown.4. The construction industry is heavily reliant on foreign workers  particularly those from India and Bangladesh. It has been struggling to cope with a shortage of these workers  even as the Manpower Ministry announced last Dec 15 that it had eased restrictions on new work permit and S Pass applications to address the labour shortfall.5. Hooi Yu Koh  chairman and chief executive of Kori Holdings  warned that while companies may not feel the pinch now - with the number of foreign workers from India granted entry approvals already relatively low - they will do so down the line  and must prepare for the manpower crunch to last longer than expected.More here,btohqsg
