Is most of the qn copy from passage?,btohqsg
everytime I do  the ans from tys and mine like a bit off,btohqsg
Its ok if u get the impt points,btohqsg
If the phrasing abit off its fine if the meaning at the end of the day is the same and can be understood by the marker,btohqsg
having butterflies in my stomach rn,btohqsg
my teacher keep saying the markers are very strict and that ans must like same as their answer scheme word for word and I'm like?????,btohqsg
Marks are strict but they dont expect u to phrase it exactly like the ans sheet,btohqsg
So if ur meaning and theirs around there u should score ur marks,btohqsg
So u need to grab those impt ones,btohqsg
Cuase u leave them out then ur thing and their diff but dont need stress just try ur best,btohqsg
O and btw first paper is p1 so have ur formats ready in the head!,btohqsg
does math bellcurve or grade boundary cause passing grade to be like 60% cause paper 1 was so easy??,btohqsg
i want to pass but given that its so easy and i flop paper 1. Sad,btohqsg
Study for p2 should be more diff,btohqsg
And i think p2 heigher weightage,btohqsg
Math should have but i dont think it affects it as drastically compared to A math?,btohqsg
And depends heavily on the papers,btohqsg
wow then passing grade would be 55% shit,btohqsg
As u said easy paper whag,btohqsg
would they set paper 2 so hard until i can't even get 40/100?,btohqsg
If hard everyone will feel the same,btohqsg
Unless u no study and flunk it,btohqsg
lol my paper 1 50/73 only  how to pass overall,btohqsg
omg can just focus on ur upcoming papers LOL not like dwelling over a paper u took alr can help u magically pass,btohqsg
Like u complain then u can go change answer,btohqsg
Never write article for whole year,btohqsg
didnt even know physics got prep,btohqsg
I heard there was no planning question,btohqsg
@cauchycriterionwill there be that ama thing from poly and jcs this year,btohqsg
And how to volunteer for your own sch,btohqsg
No ah I think it was -0.50mm,btohqsg
All the wires were around 0.4-0.5 for me  and the wire don't look thick enough to be 0.95,btohqsg
henlos did anyone here offer h3 moe econs or like h3 smu game theory? and if yall dun mind can pm me i kinda have a few qns :<or h3 moe chem / bio,btohqsg
U were supposed to add the 0.5 bro to your 0.45,btohqsg
No. Even after I measure then I adjust back to zero the thimble of the micrometer screw gauge did not go around an extra round. Could be possible that your sch used wires which are thick  although by right throughout sg the thickness should be standardised and more or less the same,btohqsg
you know 0.95mm is 0.095cm which is around 0.1cm,btohqsg
you can tell on your ruler cannot be 0.95,btohqsg
editing all the mistakes were dam obvious,btohqsg
