Otherwise for guaranteed grant  would be next year launches onwards,btohqsg
Apply for your HFE before the ORD one year is up and ask if can do deferred assessment?,btohqsg
"Yea can try that also  though they also state that it's ""at the point of flat application""",btohqsg
But with everything  possible to be by left if they allow,btohqsg
But if deferred assessment  grant will also be assessed near key collection time. So will depend on your income then,btohqsg
Our cpf isn‚Äôt an issue for the downpayment,btohqsg
The tricky part is  they have to apply for HFE before the launchFor the BTO exercise that started today  HDB recommendation was to apply for HFE by 15 MayBut seems like there were also people who applied earlier but no outcome yet ü•≤,btohqsg
When will HDB disburse the housing loan though?,btohqsg
Oh then better to apply early prior as oct has many more launches as compared to June,btohqsg
Yeahhhh. Process getting more steps as the years go by,btohqsg
Loan is at key collection I would guess,btohqsg
What do they mean by applicant taking an HDB housing loan must remain in their employment or trade when HDB disburses the housing loan? Does it just means that we just need to be employed but can be different job or must be same job?,btohqsg
Still waiting for my keys so idk the ins and outs of it,btohqsg
They wanna ensure you can pay,btohqsg
Once you get your HFE application reference number  write to HDB and ask if they can consider you for deferred assessment,btohqsg
Do make sure to apply for HFE early and make sure your CPF/cash has enough. There were too many cases whereby young adults applied for bto and managed to get a good number but end up forgoing their chance to select because not enough to pay for downpayment and the money after deducting the loan üò¢,btohqsg
Actually seeing this makes me think that there is renewal or reassessment of income when nearing key collection for HFEIf income significantly lower than before  loan amount eligible might be revised downward,btohqsg
Yep HDB said they would revise  but only downward,btohqsg
But idk things could change in between now and 1st HFE batch key collection,btohqsg
downpayment can be paid from both applicant cpf right?,btohqsg
Tbh since HFE is a relatively new thing  HDB will probably reevaluate case by case basis but I guess we dont want to give ppl false hope so we just take it at the worst case scenario üòÇ,btohqsg
This part is same as HLE,btohqsg
Yep. You don't even have to split 50 50,btohqsg
HLE will reassess both ways no?,btohqsg
Yeap but cannot fully wipe out ya,btohqsg
Okay if downpayment can be paid via both parties then it should be fine! HAHAH phew,btohqsg
I always hear ppl say they wipe out their entire cpf tho,btohqsg
Oh ya unless you're doing the applicant-essential occupier thing. Then only from applicant,btohqsg
Staggered payment is 5% then 15%. Deferred payment is 2.5% then 17.5%,btohqsg
Ok correction  can is can but better to leave some $ inside üòÇ But ya if you have tons of cash i guess you can wipe out lor,btohqsg
Yah  can only tell people that if income becomes lower when nearing key collection  loan amount may be revised downwardIf income higher  also will not increase loan amount  ha ha,btohqsg
But appeal doesn't mean definitely successful,btohqsg
By right  noBecause lower income in the past  HDB would have given higher EHG if applicant was eligible,btohqsg
Yeah we won't know for a while more,btohqsg
When I applied for my flat in Nov 2022  I was only eight months in full employment. My first appointment was in July 2023. The HDB officer realised that I declared my income based on 2022 application documents. So she asked me to re-declare my current monthly income back then. There was a form whereby your company needed to sign and with company stamp. Fast forward to Mar 2024  HDB gave me a grant on my second appointment. I hope it helps you.,btohqsg
Assuming 20% downpayment by cpf  then cpf still have money. During key collection  after deducting 20% downpayment  option fees  housing loan. Assuming left $50K for example  can this $50K only be payable by cash or can use cpf also?,btohqsg
Other than this  consider the flat prices properly... Be prudentLike  on current budget or current income situation? Something realistic?Instead of applicant think that they can afford because they should be earning more in the future,btohqsg
Still got stamp duty legal fees all that too  those cannot use CPF if im not wrong (someone pls confirm too üòÇ)0,btohqsg
I think now can use CPF lehWhat i heard was  in the past  applicant pay in cash then claim from CPFBut now can pay directly from CPF,btohqsg
I forgot which part of the BTO application must pay in cash  something something LOL other than option fee,btohqsg
Grant money can be used for payment of the flat only,btohqsg
I think only option fee must be cash,btohqsg
So technically if my cpf have a lot  technically I don‚Äôt need to fork up any cash?,btohqsg
Yes if it is a solid 6 digit  I guess so but I don‚Äôt think anyone here wants to promise you or confirm anything üòÇ In case,btohqsg
Damn one can dream of that number of digits,btohqsg
‚ÄúA lot‚Äù is very subjective üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Is just an example la BABAH,btohqsg
Only CPF OA  pleaseSometimes i also thought my CPF a lot of money... Until i see the breakdown... ü•≤üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg
Can use CPF. I used it and I‚Äôm on bank loan. Only the grant cannot be used for the conveyancing fees iirc,btohqsg
Same ü•≤üòÇüòÇActually am bit scare alsoI have CPF OA investments  need to start praying that they will do well when nearing my key collection or that  my CPF OA grows miraculously... üò∂,btohqsg
