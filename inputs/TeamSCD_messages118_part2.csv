"Lol. There is an open air carpark near the giant at Toa payoh central. Some of the lots have the stoppers because of the tree roots that comes out of the ground. 2 nights ago  i happen to park at the lot. Almost 1/4 of my car is out of the lot in front. Mind you  im driving a lowered fit. When i came back  there was another car parked beside me. Overheard the husband telling the wife  ""this fit park so far out  like its very big like that"" LOL",btohqsg
"After they walked off  I opened the door  the wife turn back and gave the ""opps"" look. LOL",btohqsg
This is the real reason suv becoming more popular,btohqsg
Mine bo bian  the car itself is damn long... But when I park beside a gtr  suddenly my car feels so small,btohqsg
@hayleescd@roinceccan u guys redo my carpark humpüíÄ,btohqsg
Ik house reno but its okay,btohqsg
But to be honest it doesn't look difficult to cross,btohqsg
No choice i guess  especially if its lowered and with aftermarket exhaust. Even in ordinary HDB mscp  i have to park slightly further forward. Lol. A small hatchback  park already can match a sedan head,btohqsg
My sister house the carpark also got one hump easy to kena,btohqsg
For lowered cars i guess it isüôÉ,btohqsg

Last time I see I think something wrong with these fellers  but now I understand,btohqsg
Somemore that one is no choice. The hump looks innocent. Is just that the road right after that hump  is dipped down.,btohqsg
