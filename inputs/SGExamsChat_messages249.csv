Hi  looking for advice on EAE specifically on business area. Any general tips and course related tips? üö®üö®,btohqsg
Pretend that you began your own small business in secondary school,btohqsg
Just ensure that there‚Äôs no way that they can verify,btohqsg
My friend faked his own business of renting lockers in my school and got his EAE accepted by NP BA,btohqsg
Do not try if u r not a good liar,btohqsg
So how do i ensure that they wouldn‚Äôt be able to verify,btohqsg
Uhh just ask yourself ‚Äòif there any way for them to check if I‚Äôm bullshitting‚Äô,btohqsg
It‚Äôs all about learning how to bs,btohqsg
Just invent a backstory that‚Äôs believable,btohqsg
Don‚Äôt say crap like ‚ÄòI made 5 digits through this business‚Äô,btohqsg
This kind of thing need bs meh,btohqsg
I run a side hustle/business on Carousell,btohqsg
thats legit enough  but ofc need proof,btohqsg
Gross. Do it for real  don't fake it. Don't recommend lying even if it gets you the result you want. The bigger picture issue with this is that eventually they will close down EAE because everyone lies to get in. Then we're back to admission only by grades.,btohqsg
Ye if your morals matter probably shouldn‚Äôt do that,btohqsg
ok la H1 econs not that bad,btohqsg
i suffering in like all the subjects bah,btohqsg
don't worry I never passed econs until a levels,btohqsg
(my raw not below 10) my sch dw accept 4h2 without raw 10 and below,btohqsg
what's the use of 4 H2 anw,btohqsg
you also have the freedom to downgrade your worse performing subject to h1 for the actual exams,btohqsg
I barely made it into an a level sch,btohqsg
4 H2 is like way beyond my league,btohqsg
Have u seen ppl abv 20 in Ur sch y1?,btohqsg
Whoops I forget the word age,btohqsg
She 18 grad from hnitec then one year take Os aka this year next year 20 when result out,btohqsg
She say she Wan go Ur sch lol,btohqsg
Some Yr 1s are also from ITE who took Os again,btohqsg
Well I know some of them kek,btohqsg
@IcedMiloHow to pass IPPT in year 3 if my fitness is trash?,btohqsg
exercise more  get a good buddy during the actual IPPT,btohqsg
I just want to pass in school,btohqsg
although if u can't pass on merit  you're better off going to PTP  because the training will slap u hard in the face if you're not physically ready,btohqsg
ah ya la get a good buddy during the sch IPPT,btohqsg
Tats why when u home then just exercise lor,btohqsg
I thot you were practically an admin alr lol,btohqsg
@chemcerboss pls accept my Reddit post,btohqsg

Sounds like people trying to make unhealthy things healthy,btohqsg
Does anybody know if I can take h2 math without A math?,btohqsg
Most likely you have to be:‚Ä¢ in science course;‚Ä¢ Distinction in EMath;‚Ä¢ Attend bridging,btohqsg
Yes I can study a math at home,btohqsg
But h1 don‚Äôt need right ?,btohqsg
The differences between H1 math and H2 math isPure mathematics for H1 is easier than A math. I.e.   there is no quoient rule and product rule. Basically 20 to 30% of the A math syllabusButpure math for h2  is the extended verison of A math.,btohqsg
As for statiatics  they are more or less the same. Just there h1 math do not have cirucular permuation and drv,btohqsg
Although  if you have A Math knowledge (that is concrete) and better at pure Math  it's better for you to take H2 Math.,btohqsg
There are some struggling to ace H1 Math as they are horrible with statistics.,btohqsg
H1 Math is more statistics oriented  ace the stats portion and a pass is already guaranteed.,btohqsg
Yeah. Only 1- 3hours paperSection A is 40 marks which is pure math sectionSection B is 60 marks which is stat section.,btohqsg
2 years of pain and suffering,btohqsg
I can self study a math at home and ask friends,btohqsg
Even if you self study A math  you might also struggle.,btohqsg
Tried to self study after flunking 2 years,btohqsg
Yijc mi {nyjc asrjc jpjc ejc} (need take test),btohqsg
Those in brackets need take test,btohqsg
@jacquelyn1234What are u aiming for in uni?,btohqsg

Something to do with environment/food science,btohqsg
Why not poly got a direct route HAHAH,btohqsg
But if I go to sajc and get to science stream will they allow me for H2 math,btohqsg

Tell appeal to Ur sec  sch For u to take amath,btohqsg
ah can take it slowly first ba. But ideally for h2 maths need amaths,btohqsg
but tbh h2 maths even if u have amath or no amath tbh to me there isnt much diff,btohqsg
Who take A math at sec 4,btohqsg
So is possible to take A math at sec 4.,btohqsg
For me  i have to take a test,btohqsg
I think it depends on the school,btohqsg
Just ask your math teacher lor,btohqsg
How much are u getting for emath?,btohqsg
Instead of taking a math I take pure geog,btohqsg
Plus my E math i kept on getting the top of the cohort,btohqsg
Not trying to flex. But E math must be very good,btohqsg
That's why myb Ur sch don't allow,btohqsg

as a user of tiger for almost a year,btohqsg
Just because their parent broker prevents them,btohqsg
robin hood prob faced that due to liquidity issues,btohqsg
and even if tiger goes bankrupt,btohqsg
the stocks u buy thru tiger are owned by custodian banks in singapore,btohqsg
Not rly imo i rmb reading about it cuz robin hood trades are processed by another trader or smt,btohqsg

recognised by Monetary Authority of Singapore,btohqsg
