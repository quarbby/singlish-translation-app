being alive is a RIGHT not a privilege,btohqsg
lol fun fact drunk sex is not sex its rape,btohqsg
have fun dealing w the law if u fuck a drunk woman,btohqsg
"I think ""can afford healthcare"" box a bit grey",btohqsg
words that get u locked up for years and caned and fined,btohqsg
i wish i can say that in court...,btohqsg
I think those grey area box is based on your own perception,btohqsg
i would like to think that 'can afford healthcare' means you have enough savings lying around to pay for a sudden and major health situation,btohqsg
I just realised why is a tick,btohqsg
11B bornes almost all healthcare expenses,btohqsg
i am guessing nuclear family means both parents still around,btohqsg
Reminds me of how someone used his 11B to go for a surgery to remove his mole,btohqsg
nuclear family just means heterosexual parents,btohqsg
The SAF pays for your medical expenses while you are an NSF,btohqsg
It‚Äôs better to not get those medical issues in the first place,btohqsg
so being in SAF is a PRIVILEGE,btohqsg
Which the SAF can cause to happen to you,btohqsg
feeling privileged to serve my nation ü•∞,btohqsg
I'm honestly disgusted that men have the privilege of serving NS,btohqsg
I wish women had the same privilege,btohqsg
why would they use the same thing for 2 boxes  I interpret it as it is a privilege to stay in a nuclear family  if stay with extended family means poor need to squeeze in 1 residence  or stay alone  no dividing of chores at home  also sad,btohqsg
Regardless of race  language  religionand gender,btohqsg
add that to the pledge please,btohqsg
but then its a privilege until you get a permanent injury that affects you for the rest of your life,btohqsg
I am a feminist so I must speak out to include them in our national burden,btohqsg
Women should be given the privilege of paying alimony in a divorce situation,btohqsg
It's disgusting that only men have that privilege,btohqsg
then men should be given the privilege of having hold a baby in their tummy for 9 months and bond with it,btohqsg
i googled it says two parenrs with their kids?,btohqsg
It's not a burden  it's a privilege,btohqsg
Ah  but this is a choice  not a privilege,btohqsg
btw are you joking or are you serious,btohqsg
men should be given the privilege of having a ‚Äúmen-only‚Äù train carriage to ensure our safety,btohqsg
well tbh it is a privilege to experience such pure love towards a baby but im saying reason men pa y alimony is cuz of this,btohqsg
I was joking  women pay alimony as well nowadays if they're the breadwinner,btohqsg
But in the past  it wasn't the case,btohqsg
so it was a step in the right direction,btohqsg
Because women get to take responsibility?,btohqsg
pets should also pay the rent,btohqsg
I think we're still a very conservative society if we discriminate against house husbands,btohqsg
Yup  a nuclear family must have 2 parents and kids but any more than that  grandparent  uncle aunty  will void the nuclear family. Meaning no parent = no nuclear but have parents not necessarily nuclear  my interpretation.,btohqsg
because u guys dont have to carry a baby in u for 9 months and be vulnerable to illnesses cuz ur immune system is weak and ur body is not as mobile etc,btohqsg
Carry field pack for 22 months,btohqsg
i think then my family is not nuclear family then,btohqsg
i will carry and be house hubby,btohqsg
i'd rather pay alimony than carry a baby in me for 9 months,btohqsg
That means also must have menstruation?,btohqsg
Well  you can‚Äôt get pregnant without menstruation,btohqsg
i will bleed for my nation,btohqsg
Do you want be to be technical there HAHAHA,btohqsg
