Good that they start from an effective quarter (i.e. Q4),btohqsg
Just as i want to apply this card for insurance...,btohqsg
Still need to spend the remaining to clock the minimum hais,btohqsg
also anyone has recommendations on what personal accident and critical illness insurance to get?,btohqsg
Means to say up the 50% of the monthly spend of the calendar month can be made up of insurance only?,btohqsg
It means your insurance spending can only make up to 50% of eligible spending...$300 - insurance up to $150$1000 - insurance up to $500$2000 - insurance up to $1000,btohqsg
If i exceed then how. Example i clock $300 in total  of which $200 is insurance. So $50  will not count toward the $300 and cashback calculation or what will happen,btohqsg
For those who still cannot visualise..Example 1: $200 Insurance  $100 Other Eligible Spend (Total Spend: $300)Actual Eligible Spend: $150 + $100 = $250Result: Not eligible for cashbackExample 2: $500 Insurance  $400 Other Eligible Spend (Total Spend: $900)Actual Eligible Spend: $150 + $400 = $550Result: Eligible for $30 cashbackExample 3: $2000 Insurance  $500 Other Eligible Spend (Total Spend: $2500)Actual Eligible Spend: $500 + $500 = $1000Result: Eligible for $100 cashbackExample 4: $100 Insurance  $1900 Other Eligible Spend (Total Spend $2000)Actual Eligible Spend: $100 + $1900 = $2000Result: Eligible for $200 cashbackAnyone nice want to help to turn this into table format for easy viewing can do so ðŸ™‚,btohqsg
Yup  they will take max 150 from insurance  remaining u need to spend on other eligble spending,btohqsg
Wanna check with experts here for credit card payments via PayPal - is it normally excluded in the credit card promo minimum spend exclusions? I see in the list there are several PAYPAL - OANDA..... etc kinda exclusions so wanna ask if anyone did a PayPal payment before to clock the minimum spend on cc promos,btohqsg
Chill I typing out for y'all. Confirm know got such qn haha,btohqsg
Paypal* merchant name. So if your merchant not on exclusion list  it is eligble,btohqsg
Example 2 will qualify for tier 2 isnt it?,btohqsg
Oops I meant to put 400,btohqsg
Basically what this mean is that if u want to clock 1 k insurance u need match 1k of other eligble spending.Abit like their fd where u need to park how much in normal saving in order to get to park in their high fd,btohqsg
It is similar but better then uob for non bonus spending as half can make up by insurance,btohqsg
I added the total spend so easily see,btohqsg
Just need to plan spending well to get 3.33 percent,btohqsg
Thank you boss  till today I haven't touch chatgpt ðŸ¤£,btohqsg
Sadly they didn't put the calculation for the actual eligible spend in haha,btohqsg
