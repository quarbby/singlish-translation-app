Credit Suisse Default Swaps Are 18 Times UBS  9 Times Deutsche Bank:Source1. The cost of insuring the bonds of Credit Suisse Group AG against default in the near-term is approaching a level that typically signals serious investor concerns.2. One-year credit default swaps for the embattled Swiss lender were indicated at 835.9 basis points on Tuesday’s close of business  based on pricing source CMAQ. Other pricing sources point to a further rise on Wednesday  while a level of 1 000 would indicate serious concern. The current level is about 18 times the one-year CDS for rival Swiss bank UBS Group AG  and about 9 times the equivalent for Deutsche Bank AG.3. Credit Suisse is in the midst of a complex three-year restructuring in a bid to return the bank to profitability. It was hard hit by the recent wave of bearishness triggered by Silicon Valley Bank’s demise  with its five-year CDS spreads hitting a record. Shares hit a new record low Wednesday after the bank’s top shareholder ruled out providing more financial assistance to the struggling Swiss bank  citing regulatory constraints.More here,btohqsg

Have problem or not  largely depends on  public beliefs. It's a fact that even the best bank has only less than 20 cents available for every dollar deposited.Just like once enough people believe you are dependable (or crazy)  you will be deemed as such  never mind if you are really dependable (or crazy).It is incredibly resource and time intensify to reverse such perceived image.So do you still believe in the banking systems? Do you continue to keep deposits with banks?,btohqsg
