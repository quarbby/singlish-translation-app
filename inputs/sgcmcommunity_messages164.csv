But you need to accept that honda is luxurious and a performance car,btohqsg
Luxurious car check list1 Honda ✔️2 Vtec ✔️3 FWD ✔️,btohqsg
Clearly you never sat in one,btohqsg
U like not . Vellfire ?,btohqsg
Always make me feel like a boss,btohqsg
Ya… I love it too.. especially the one with recliner..,btohqsg
Why does it need to be RWD to be considered luxury,btohqsg
Isn’t it more on the interior? No?,btohqsg
You do you hahaha. what car do you drive now?,btohqsg
Why your seats make you sore one,btohqsg
I only many many wash at my weekend snow bubbles job at Shell Siglap,btohqsg
You just went one big round and make it sound so complicated to say one thing in your opinion: point 3.,btohqsg
Oooo I haven’t eaten lunch yet,btohqsg
Now starting to feel a bit hungry,btohqsg
What did everyone have for lunch!,btohqsg
What's your name? Don't be rude.,btohqsg
Depending on the language  maybe yes  maybe no.,btohqsg
for some reason I read the above as “squid”,btohqsg
You have a kaki drive rickshaw  I drive a shitbox apparently  as long as we happy...who needs a luxurious car?,btohqsg
Gosh I miss having aperol spritz like it's water.,btohqsg
Fries do sound nice right now,btohqsg
Patatine fritte e birra è la vita,btohqsg
Let him lah. He is atas and high class man,btohqsg
Must. The idea is that fries are luxury,btohqsg
No  but for some it gives rear end boost.,btohqsg
Does it fit the 3 commandments?,btohqsg
Onion rings for max boost setting,btohqsg
Mala I only eat the 0 spice,btohqsg
I told myself no fast food….,btohqsg
No fast food how to be fast?!?! It’s like V Power.,btohqsg
Okay  while I may not agree with his theory  if what you're offering is a CLA  no.,btohqsg
To be fair  luxury is really....subjective,btohqsg
Eh cars with nice lights inside just screams luxury to me man,btohqsg
That kant thinks it needs to be RWD to be luxurious...let him think that,btohqsg
By his logic  a GT86/BRZ is luxury 😂,btohqsg
No fancy lights = no like,btohqsg
You like it to scream do you?,btohqsg
Like how no hud means shortchanged ah,btohqsg
Oh then remove cla from the list,btohqsg
Can you please read point 2,btohqsg
Lux enough for me. Anymore it’s too bright imho,btohqsg
On whether it is in centre? Or bias towards front or rear,btohqsg
It starts with.. “you can have it all…”,btohqsg

Was I though I reading email sia,btohqsg
Depends how loud your car is... If must cover ears. Less than a second. They just send you out. If not then maybe 1-2 minutes,btohqsg
Simi NEA  testing not done by vicom meh,btohqsg
Thanks. Its a common car..i secured the coe for 4 weeks already. The agent says the car is stuck at nea coz of noise test.But it has been weeks that the agent say its at nea. When i ask when can get the car  they keep on saying stuck at nea...and need documents etv,btohqsg
I oso thought viacom..but the agent told me..its a new nea ruling from april this year..new cars need to have noise test,btohqsg
This was the link they sent,btohqsg
So dumb. Anyway stock cars where got noisy one,btohqsg
People itchy backside put aftermarket exhaust and decat then will loud,btohqsg
Thats why its a stock car..from a pi,btohqsg

Procedures on Importation and Registration of a Car in Singaporehttps://onemotoring.lta.gov.sg/content/dam/onemotoring/Buying/PDF/Importation_Guidelines/Car.pdf,btohqsg
Pi got some pi scam. Keep making excuse car is late,btohqsg
Just buy ad model. Less chance of scam.,btohqsg
NEA sets the standard  testing would be LTA. But then again if the model has already gone thru homoglation  it should be a breeze and not stucked somewhere for weeks. Utter BS imho,btohqsg
Will.update you guys on the outcome..thanks thanks,btohqsg
Coz im not sure of the procedure..so im assuming that noise test takes some time..,btohqsg
I think they are just unable to deliver the car to you . Maybe till you requested that you do not want to wait anymore.,btohqsg
By X if i dont receive the car  give back money,btohqsg
No I dont drive bmw alr😂😂 u shud go find the 3 series grp,btohqsg

Red is the only way to go,btohqsg
But you may sacrifice your tint when you take it off,btohqsg
There's a tape that looks greenish  the shop where I did my tint swears by it,btohqsg
Hi  would like to ask  in this climate of high COE  will going for a new car or secondhand car makes more sense ? I have heard dealers selling to me based on the theory of “getting a brand new car now  then sell it 1-2 years later for another higher end car”..Is this true ?,btohqsg
first 3 years your new car depreciate the most,btohqsg
let others tank the depreciation and buy a 3 year old car la,btohqsg
Honestly we can’t answer for you,btohqsg
Actually depends on the new car what car,btohqsg
If you buy type r confirm can profit one,btohqsg
Hmmm why do you say so ?,btohqsg
I am looking at a SUV.. the likes of Volkswagen T cross/ Audi q3,btohqsg
I got a Note and selling it now would give me some small profit of few K. Thinking to buy into T cross  dealer also mentioned that I can buy a T cross now and then upgrade to Q3 1-2 years later.. not too sure if they are right or am I being smoked ?,btohqsg
just buy Q3 now? you switch 1 car in between still lose value when you trade in or sell,btohqsg
just decide on a model and stick with it...,btohqsg
wish we have the T-Roc in Singapore,btohqsg
Just curious why would it lose value if one were to switch 1 car in between ?,btohqsg
out of curiousity were you speaking to the sales at VW?,btohqsg
of course they will tell you to buy a T-cross,btohqsg
trade in = lose money  early redemption of loan = lose money  new car taxes = lose money,btohqsg
buy new car and don't drive for 5 years = lose money,btohqsg
buy car in singapore immediately lose money,btohqsg
best is take bus mrt and walk,btohqsg
Yes I am! They seems to be selling T cross a lot,btohqsg
But I feel that their selling strategy worked ? Because I have a colleague who just bought a T cross too,btohqsg
this is peer pressure that's why you wanna buy,btohqsg
He was also sold the idea of “get a T cross now and few years later can upgrade to some other car”,btohqsg
Not really. Because I went to see see look look first,btohqsg
don't listen to them la  get a skoda kodiaq,btohqsg
drive for 5 years maybe can change to EV liao,btohqsg
It’s a new thing  of course they’ll be pushing it. Cars depreciate. The only country where regular cars appreciate is in Singapore  but don’t hold your breath on COE and resale being higher,btohqsg
Buy what you want  forget the gimmick of being able to trade around without losing money  it always will.,btohqsg
But the road tax is really cheap,btohqsg
Yes it’s really expensive.A secondhand might work for me more,btohqsg
Car only losses  no profit one 🤭🤭 loose more or loose lesser only,btohqsg
"Actually can ""upgrade"" is because of the false sense that now coe very high  few years down the road if and that is if coe drops by half or more",btohqsg
Buy 4d toto also  if strike its loose less not windfall  or like tontine,btohqsg
It will only increase won't decrease,btohqsg
Omg. All countries luffing @ us. Pay so much for 1.0L,btohqsg
"Can only pray lo...like my dad's time when he change a 2009 altis for a 2014 one ""1 to 1""  only because coe not that high and the 2009 altis still got full 5 yrs left but his monthly is higher",btohqsg
So  the vw car agent is basically filling the customer brain with bs...if doesn't understand the car market  then will buy it lo,btohqsg
I know because I work in sales,btohqsg
But really was sold the idea at the point in time.,btohqsg
Lol means the sales guy's got skill..but just remember there's no free lunch where buying car in sg is concerned  even if low or no down-payment to change car  there's the monthly that we can't escape and definitely be higher than now,btohqsg
He was saying this one will be an upgrade. Not sure if monthly will be sane or higher ?,btohqsg
"Lol upgrade sure means monthly also ""upgrade"" one la",btohqsg
Oh from note to vw t cross yeah of course upgrade,btohqsg
I believe even if you take the car price less 30% and divide by 7(max)  monthly sure higher than what you're paying now,btohqsg
Car Loan Calculator | Compare Loans & Instalment - Sgcarmarthttps://m.sgcarmart.com/services/calculator.php,btohqsg
Use this calculator to get a better pic,btohqsg
Your note I believe is about 800 to 1k monthly? Or 1.2?,btohqsg
if ur gna do grab  ur maintenance gna up.. just rent,btohqsg
Yes about $700 now.If change will be doubled $1 400.Very ex indeed.But the dealer mentioned to bank on the next change (VW to Audi) when COE drops in the coming 2025 plus minus. But I don’t know how the math work out. Shld have asked,btohqsg
If you buy during high COE and trade in during low COE  won't you lose alot of money instead?,btohqsg
"Now some owner can get ""profit"" cause they buy low COE and sell during high COE. So if you do that in 2025 when the COE supply is high  won't the value of your car get cut by alot?",btohqsg
Yes this is what they quote me for my current car. Profit of few K,btohqsg
You buy civic confirm can profit,btohqsg
Buy dogecoin!! In a few years  dogecoin to the moon!!!,btohqsg
sell high buy high  your monthly will jump much higher.if few years down the road COE drops significantly and you bought with loan. don't think it will help you jump to a more expensive car.you might even have to sell at loss and top up to repay your loan.,btohqsg
Wah that's very irresponsible of him to say that. He's asking you to bet on it but if coe doesn't drop  you'll be left hanging dry  not him.,btohqsg
High enough to cover the dp lo  like in my dad's case a decade ago,btohqsg
"Lol erase the word ""profit""  its a term such sales ppl use to try and smoke you.",btohqsg
no one knows when coe will drop  if it doesnt  u are screwed financially. while he still gets his commission,btohqsg
i remember there was a time ppl had to topup to sell their car.,btohqsg
yah keep within ur means. there is no need to upgrade now if u dun need.,btohqsg
Your money is hard-earned  dun let it go so easily,btohqsg
700 to 1.4k that's x2 of now,btohqsg
Wa this one jialat. You sell to get money end up lose money,btohqsg
no choice if u need to cut expenses,btohqsg
compensate 5k rather than 15 or 20k problem,btohqsg
that's what i know.so don't know what logic that salesman is trying to smoke,btohqsg
just drive ur current car until it cant meet your practical needs  then change to a bigger one,btohqsg
I think it's because of the loan so have to tiap money,btohqsg
all salesman just want their commission and their KPI. No one cares about you More than Urself,btohqsg
Can change car  but definitely not because of the bs the sales person tried to sell you 🤭,btohqsg
yup  cos market not good have to sell the car bought at very expensive price. then selling in bad times cannot cover back the loan.,btohqsg
Common during the 10 years loan. 0 d/p. Buy high  sell low,btohqsg
How is your vezel doing bro ?,btohqsg
No money for body kit leh,btohqsg
Hi  did you get a preowned T-cross or a new one? Can advise the price?,btohqsg
700 monthly don't itchy backside la  drive until scrap dude,btohqsg
How is your morning so far!,btohqsg
Public Holiday next week papy miscount,btohqsg
PE Ah ? I know who I want to vote,btohqsg
That time yall say use F1A6 or dont use F1A6?,btohqsg
F1a6 many say very good like track tyre with good grip n quiet but wear rate nt as good as ps5 which is noisier,btohqsg
Wear rate means wear n tear faster issit,btohqsg
U using what now ah Sir,btohqsg
😂😂 i scare skid leh. I use for my hyundai its fine but my friend say its not very good,btohqsg
I have been using it on my ride,btohqsg
I love yokohama cus my wallet is saved😂,btohqsg
I remember i change continental damn big hole,btohqsg
Of cos there branded one ps4,btohqsg
Just wanna check f1a6 good anot for my friend cus i remember someone here talking abt it😂,btohqsg
Lmao I just saw sgcm got eshop,btohqsg
Literally as I just talking abt tyres,btohqsg
So far so good? Exp? How much per tyre,btohqsg
Left front took a lot of beating. So going to wear out there soon,btohqsg
i shall go check my current tyre,btohqsg
cant remember im 245/40/18 o r what,btohqsg
as in price of new tyre or my current tyree specs,btohqsg
I read up on the switching of tyre to another specification . So difficult,btohqsg
Get f1a6 better  so much cheaper for same level of performance,btohqsg
This is for 245/40/18 sizing? How come so cheap ah,btohqsg
Everywhere I checked  all also around 230-245,btohqsg
idk leh  i input my car model only,btohqsg
then they nvr let me choose size,btohqsg
then my rims 18inch this price,btohqsg
Kpe erp want to raise till $6,btohqsg
another 1 year n 3 months to go,btohqsg
they shudnt increase and cap it at $5,btohqsg
the other day i damn tilt,btohqsg
the car infront of me slow,btohqsg
Every erp they increase to $6,btohqsg
Like that then i will feel better,btohqsg
Gov need more to store in their 'reserves',btohqsg
Like that they better faster launch their distance erp,btohqsg
I think that 1 even worst,btohqsg
They can't launch the GPS tracking cos when underground and in high rise building area  it's not accurate. Infrastructure to track is  complex. That's why they haven't announce anything yet.,btohqsg
Just launch and correct the error through mistake,btohqsg
I wonder if they want to absorb 8% gst into it as well,btohqsg
With the way SG'ians complain...I doubt they'll do that. lol,btohqsg
8% gst also people complain   the folk also accept it   9% soon . People complain.,btohqsg
I think car model they spec the stock size. If you changed your sizing  check the size directly!,btohqsg
Overall I think still cheaper than the prices I’ve seen outside actually. PS4 same size going for $262/pc,btohqsg
They like people like you 😜,btohqsg
Complain also no point. Takes time for them to implement changes,btohqsg
The new HDB format is good,btohqsg
And good for singles dun need wait till 35,btohqsg
Need thank *P and P*P for putting forth in paliarment,btohqsg
But must hold for 10 yrs before can sell?,btohqsg
I think they need to collect the votes now . If not by then   hard to collect,btohqsg
Public Housing shouldnt be speculated in the first place,btohqsg
But only 2 room . My friend says very small,btohqsg
You single want so much space for what,btohqsg
Sgcm prices cheaper than outside sia. Dunno gt include tyre rotation or patching mah,btohqsg
Yeah man. I’m torn going through them or going to other shops. Also don’t mind paying a little more if shops can offer 10k rotation  balancing and patching up.,btohqsg
I'm happy with petlas PT741. Have used 4 gens of F1A1 onwards  CSC. Value for money especially during promo,btohqsg
Stamford tyres offer life time patching n 10K rotation,btohqsg
Do they provide complimentary nitrogen top up?,btohqsg
Oh my tyre spec 225/40/R18Jovi Tan,btohqsg
How much do you spend on tyres?,btohqsg
u tracking so must have better tyres,btohqsg
lol. Soon lo . RE71RS 😂,btohqsg
Now also going to be same,btohqsg
Except this. This one damn expensive…at least it’s not $480/CUP2 expensive,btohqsg
$2x0 per piece reasonable leh I think. I know some people the tyre $400 each one,btohqsg
My previous tyre was hankook s1 evo 3 245/40/19 🤣,btohqsg
What tayar u on now ?,btohqsg
That time I ask for 19” i nearly faint,btohqsg
I didn’t know the market rate pricing,btohqsg
My car can only afford tourador,btohqsg
Lucky u never up 20 inch,btohqsg
I would if I had enough space,btohqsg
I now thinking should I change rims and up 19” 😂,btohqsg
Or stay 18” but put wider,btohqsg
Wait till 20 inch and 305 wide,btohqsg
Ya ! Shoik I always see I stim,btohqsg

Opc car can drive on 1sept?,btohqsg
You go to the service snd like book the dat,btohqsg
Yes sir . I are correct,btohqsg
this guy still here ah LOL,btohqsg
Power bro.. 405 lah… boss nvr sponsor ah,btohqsg
Hi@shermanlyh! We just launch the e-Shop platform yesterday  so for 10k rotation  tyre balancing  patching up and nitrogen top ups - let me send this message internally to see how this can be offered to our customers.,btohqsg
The first half of the message like scammy,btohqsg
walao dont like that leh. i trying to be professional,btohqsg
But honestly v good feedback - glad to hear@shermanlyhdon't mind topping up abit more for it 🤣,btohqsg
I think it's about trust and reliability...,btohqsg
How is the price compared to AL?,btohqsg
Can do a membership kinda thing for the perks,btohqsg
Like $20 a year for lifetime patching  10k rotation and another 3% discount or something on tyres etc,btohqsg
This one y'all have to do your own research already 😅,btohqsg
Fantastic idea. Sending this to my bosses HAHA,btohqsg
No la  i'm sure u guys are saavy enough to find out,btohqsg
If you stock semi slicks maybe January I buy 😂,btohqsg
I think it’s ok to make a loss initially to make ppl join,btohqsg
Swee.. we're definitely looking to work with suppliers to get more tyres,btohqsg
Like how grab used to loan billions of funds to burn but is a listed company now,btohqsg
Buy a few to keep ah,btohqsg
Nope. I anticipate my semi slicks to be Botak by Jan LOL,btohqsg
Actually shud we buy from sgcm? Cus for now it doesnt come w balancing n tyre rotation right  just installation of tyres 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Balancing should come as a standard leh for new tires,btohqsg
Hahaha I definitely don’t. If I go out to patch  I have to pay $8-10 each time and work requires me to drive into industrial areas  this is a huge bonus for me. Rotation also costs $15-20 so these things do add up in the long run actually,btohqsg
Yeah  seems to be the case at the moment! But one thing really great about the SGCM platform is that for installation  they have various workshops at different locations so convenience is pretty good. I currently only see maybe 3-4 different shops? If they can expand to pull more tyre shops to jump on board  that could be pretty interesting,btohqsg
This is fantastic as well. And if SGCM can somehow tie all the partner tyre workshops together so this membership thing works across all shops  I feel SGCM could potentially become the one stop for all tyre needs islandwide.I can change my tyres in the east and purchase this add on membership (better if it’s free when purchasing tyres hahaha)  have a puncture in the west and conveniently go to a west workshop to get it patched.,btohqsg
Ya man the tyre industry needs a shakeup,btohqsg
I kinda already decided to go with Pitstop tyres for my next change because they have all these benefits when I go with them even though I’m paying $25 more per tyre. The cheaper workshop will charge me additional $60 for balancing so honestly  the difference is only $40. And I still get free rotation  balancing  patching up & nitrogen fill with PT.,btohqsg
Only downside is with patching up  I need to drive down to their workshop to enjoy the free services so if SGCM could tackle this  users can enjoy convenience no matter where they are on the island. And if I have to pay an additional fee for this islandwide convenience  I think it’s still pretty worthwhile.,btohqsg
I changed my tyres at pit stop. The boss and his daughter are really nice and genuine.,btohqsg
I repaired kerb rash at pit stop before  edmund very good at what he does haha,btohqsg

Coe collected is go to gov or LTaa?,btohqsg
Left pocket / Right pocket...same person,btohqsg
GG means if really cannot afford BTO...buy a Sienta?,btohqsg
You'll only own it for 10 yrs tho. BTO is much longer. So you can decide. lol,btohqsg
"ok ma every 10 years change ""house"" like flipping flats",btohqsg
Incorrect way of thinking. Cost of BTO last for...say 70 years. Car (if same as cost of BTO) only last 10 years. Naturally getting a BTO is a better choice. No extra expenses every 10 years,btohqsg
but the joke is that BTO is as expensive as car lol,btohqsg
That's with assumption if COE rising keeps going up each month. In a few years...will hit that amount.,btohqsg
Then choose either bto or car,btohqsg
Bto can get 30s loan   car only 7 yrs,btohqsg
haha well good luck to the TFR at this rate,btohqsg
BTO can still utilise your CPF as initial payment. Car...outright cash initial payment.,btohqsg
Bto is 2 person  google and see lor,btohqsg

Damn 100k Coe for cat A,btohqsg
its literally 20% of a HDB now,btohqsg
I think some of the previous launches (precovid)  2 room flexi after grant is like 80-90k,btohqsg
Grant need payback when sell hse de,btohqsg
I was referring to a normal 4 or 5 rm abt 500k so 20% of a HDB😂😂,btohqsg
This one pay back to your own OA bro  technically still your money,btohqsg
I dun see why I use my own money still need payback leh,btohqsg
Its not my money if i have no control over it,btohqsg
Anyway without grant  recent 2 room flexi at tengah is $125 000 to $155 000. Still cheaper than Toyota altis LOL,btohqsg
Thanks for telling me this. Officially CAR MORE EXP than BTO 2 Rm le,btohqsg

Idea is for everyone to forget abt owning cars and move towards car light n ev,btohqsg
Grab / PHV fares are noticibly more expensive also. I feel like compared to last year I am paying close to 20% more,btohqsg
Grab insist is due to higher demand,btohqsg
Pfft its due to increased cost,btohqsg
Cannot be coe up ur rental car rental stay the same one,btohqsg
The cost must be covered. If the fare dont up how driver earn or make a living,btohqsg
GST increase 1% but food cost go up >10% each time. Let the debate go on. lol,btohqsg
that's some BS from Grab sia lol,btohqsg
just want to make $ only,btohqsg
COE is part of that amount too,btohqsg
Simple coffeeshop kopi-o raise by 20cents. haiz.,btohqsg
because GST is applied at every stage along the supply chain,btohqsg
so by the time really reach the final consumer,btohqsg
Then the same concept of Grab fee rising cos of other cost rising.,btohqsg
coffee bean at port -> container truck -> warehouse -> lorry/van -> coffeeshopsee how many times it is taxed in that chain? lolhaven't even add in laboralso  don't forget COE for the vehicles used,btohqsg
Public transport would be the cheaper option once our car 10yr ownership is over.,btohqsg
Nissan E-power cars really helped Tan Chong sales apparently,btohqsg
