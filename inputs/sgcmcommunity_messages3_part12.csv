My car don't have radiator. How ah,btohqsg
Ya... Will lugi alot if really does so... imagine how big and how much already the ev battery cost.. not just ordinary battery...😅😅😅,btohqsg
That would dampen demand towards end of COE,btohqsg
Or ppl would just continue to renew?,btohqsg
Based on current battery tech  10 years is likely to degrade by 10% at most.,btohqsg
⏳Less than 48 hours till the end of our current sgCarMart x Caltex Giveaway!⏳Participate in the poll and stand a chance to walk away with $20 worth of Caltex fuel e-vouchers🥳,btohqsg
Hi guys wanna ask..Lancer Ex GT 2.0 how's the fc..,btohqsg
2.0 and it a old car,btohqsg
How good will the fc be,btohqsg
It based on the older mivec glxi engine. The car is heavy. 6 speed cvt. You will be getting a Honda fit or Prius if you worried about fuel economy,btohqsg
I’d say 9km/l. Most 2.0 NA gets this fc,btohqsg
On highway maybe 11-12km/l; city drive defensively 9-10km/l,btohqsg
City driving be prepared 8.5-9/l and highway 11-12/l,btohqsg
I was getting 11.5km/l when new back in 2008. Now need to factor in wear and tear...9-10km/l my guess,btohqsg
My old 2.5 litre when new was about 9km/L and when past 10 years about 8.5km/L. I expect slightly better for 2.0,btohqsg
BMW E90 318i 2 Litre 4 cylinders averages at 8.6km/lData collected over 10 years  8x xxx km,btohqsg
Any civic 1.5T 2018 model driver here?,btohqsg
Oh coz driving 2008 civic 1.6..quite bad also the fc now..not sure whether i need to wait for service mileage/date then go..not sure if servicing part plays a part for the fc,btohqsg
Maybe u wan to consider to do walnut blasting to clean the intake/exhaust valve  intake manifold and clean the throttle body too,btohqsg
It will help restore some performance Reduce fc as well,btohqsg
Honda engine generally very solid seldom break down at high mileage,btohqsg
How bad is quite bad. If its really bad there might be other issues at play,btohqsg
What are the simple affordable 'basic procedures' to do at the workshop if the car has bad FC?,btohqsg
what is your definition of affordable?,btohqsg
Bad FC?Heavy legAir filterPlugTyreHeavy loadsCity usage,btohqsg
Say  not above $300 per 'procedure'.,btohqsg
tyre air - free from petrol station,btohqsg
each item above are below $300,btohqsg
My friend did this  but the workshop did not remove the TB  they just removed the air box  sprayed cleaning solution into the TB and cleaned wherever they can reach with a cloth on their finger. Is it correct?,btohqsg
different price different type of workmanship,btohqsg
ok. did he feel any improvement? i am guessing not.,btohqsg
This seems to be the “usual” method:),btohqsg
Yes this is very true…. U have to be quite lucky to see a Honda break down,btohqsg
He said the rpm does not fluctuate 'so much' now. Its more stable. This is the improvement.,btohqsg
That’s the purpose of cleaning the TB:),btohqsg
Cos it can be very “elaborate “ too,btohqsg
Cos I saw on YouTube  the TB is removed for cleaning...😁😁😁😁,btohqsg
That’s more elaborate and will prob cost more,btohqsg
Normally to remove TB for cleaning will cost $80-$100.,btohqsg
Engine deficient could be caused by  carbon deposit  valve clearance  piston ring worn out  catalytic converter partial clogged etc. too many possibility,btohqsg
Oh I see. Thanks for the info.,btohqsg
