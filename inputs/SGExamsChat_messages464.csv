moral of the story: don't use that car if you want to survive a crash with a truck,btohqsg
She worked as a SS Volunteer and tourted those in german camps for thrill,btohqsg
bro was playing scrabble and didn‚Äôt know what to put,btohqsg

The holiday resport singaporean boys will enjoy for two years in their life,btohqsg
Btw  yall that went ns...yall saw the SMRT money train?,btohqsg
before everything was transmitted through the internet  a train used to transport money from one station to the next,btohqsg
i actually alr got URTI symptoms when i booked in this Wednesday üíÄ,btohqsg
but i alr got meds in bunk plus in our coy after MC u got 2 day 'LD',btohqsg
they decomissioned it and gave it to the SAF,btohqsg
as a part of training equipment,btohqsg
yea i heard from my bunk mates üíÄ,btohqsg
also the pic i sent is very much related to the money train,btohqsg
mine was last week but i had re IFC,btohqsg
not really old mrt cabin ( well no changes from old to new anyways) but from the oldest generation train in SG,btohqsg
Fun Fact: 88 train cars of the oldest generation were brought into singapore,btohqsg
back when our trains came across the pacific,btohqsg
is that chinese on the ship,btohqsg
most likely a hong kong registered vessel,btohqsg
can a train be flown over??,btohqsg
are u saying hongkong is part of china,btohqsg
errr there were a total of 66 trainsets of the oldest generation that was made  each train had 6 cars...,btohqsg
i cant imagine a whole cabin being flown over,btohqsg
cabin‚Äôs as big as a plane,btohqsg
but let me show you something that used to come by plane,btohqsg
supposed to alr be in service like 2 years ago,btohqsg
For economical reasons  its clear why this shit no longer come by planes,btohqsg
they transported both bendy buses in one flight??,btohqsg
i want a bendy bus too,btohqsg
Oh yea btw  some of our old busses have found new life in thailand,btohqsg
plane looks so thin for some reason,btohqsg
All these used to be sg busses,btohqsg
imagine going to thailand and finding the buses familiar,btohqsg
when i bookin i had 2 days to bookout,btohqsg
I introduce to you a cursed pic,btohqsg
If that was not clear enough  this should do the trick,btohqsg
wait thats an OC 500 LE?,btohqsg
man they look wayy different than how they look here,btohqsg
it was a prototype brought over to singapore to test how the bus will perform in singapore,btohqsg
It passed its trials..so we got to see another cursed version of it,btohqsg
GET ME BLEACH RIGHT F ING NOW,btohqsg
GET THAT OUT OF MY FACR,btohqsg
that bus never saw service under that livery and was repainted and became a private bus,btohqsg
How about another cursed picture lmao,btohqsg
my eyes haven't seen worse days than this,btohqsg
nothing to see here  not like seeing a modern day sbs bus on something that looks like it came from the 1960s,btohqsg
what wld be ur reaction if lets say we replace cheese on pizza with barbecue sauce?,btohqsg
yea nvm i can't really make u eyebleach i guess :/,btohqsg
unless u wanna know this fact that there is a vocation in the air force where u will still be in the air force but u will wear the green uni,btohqsg
you know whats even worse? There is literally no backstory about this bus or even why this bus was repainted,btohqsg
trying to think of one ü§î,btohqsg
Its like a urban legend in singapore,btohqsg
i think so its that i forgor its name,btohqsg
THEN WHATS THE POINT OF EVEN HAVING SBS TRANSIT LIVERY,btohqsg
yes best use of it üóø,btohqsg
man actually reminds of peeps making an SBST livery for KHI/C151,btohqsg
im going with my family to paya lebar at 11pm ltr for hdl,btohqsg
Watch it be filled with xmms and yps,btohqsg
we call the paintjob a livery,btohqsg
try searching OC 500 LE on google,btohqsg
you'll either see the SMRT white/red livery or the pandan green one,btohqsg
iirc only SMRT had the OC 500 LEs  and SBS transit never had one  so its cursed to see a bus thats owned by SMRT in SBST livery....,btohqsg
btw  i know a bus that is def cute,btohqsg
That momment you realise  We make busses for hong kong in singapore,btohqsg
my father told  me its easy to down pes,btohqsg
just say you are allergic to something plausible,btohqsg
i heard ppl who have claimed they are allergic to pollen and get a down pes,btohqsg
give me a sec  i may have a reason,btohqsg
should be able to downpes with this right?,btohqsg
imagine it becomes a massive wart,btohqsg
wht you think of my downpes reason?,btohqsg
moral of the story: always try,btohqsg
"1 encik told me ""you want down pes? you go stand at the railing shout i want to jump down can alr""",btohqsg
is my reason credible to downpes?,btohqsg
i know 1 dude downpes for flat feet,btohqsg
but his bmt was 6 years ago ah,btohqsg
"Wednesday i tried chaokeng the MO said ""you are the doctor or am i the doctor""",btohqsg
you barely can even see the toes,btohqsg
bro help my feet is so flat and it hurts when i run long distances,btohqsg
like theres a sharp pain on both feet when i run more than 3 km,btohqsg
i told my foot doctor (forgot the name) that and she was like yeAh its possible that it may be because of flatfeet but abit iffy cuz she couldnt really tie the pain to the flatfeet condition.,btohqsg
in conclusion i told my MO during checkup and hopefully can downpes! also my flatfoot is pretty severe its almost completely flat,btohqsg

If the country the delegate is representing does certain stuff that might contrast the topic given/may have contributed to the problem in topic,btohqsg
Shld I stand from the countrys perspective or stand from the perspective that the problem related to the topic shld be eliminated üò≠,btohqsg
you provide solutions to how the problem is to be eliminated but make sure the solution  what you are suggesting  is sth that your country would actually do/consider to do,btohqsg

I dont need a stable job but I need some insights on nigerian agriculture and tech infrastructure,btohqsg
There was a bot that joined,btohqsg
better luck  should have asked who wants to buy milo per hour,btohqsg
"then when people start questioning  say oh sorry i mean milo power...then when they asked again  tell them...""do you want to buy my own powder""?",btohqsg

MacBook m1 air good if ur course allows,btohqsg
So inconvenient to bring a cable and adapter just to charge your pencil,btohqsg
That's why I upgraded to iPad Pro from mini,btohqsg
Third party pencils will always have compromises too,btohqsg
just took a closer look at this and realised that it's almost completely stripped  including the gangway  bogie and the underside components,btohqsg

Most models sold thru poly personally didn't satisfy my needs or have compromises,btohqsg
Some brands got offer student discounts on their online store btw,btohqsg
really depends on what you‚Äôll end up using the laptop for outside of basic functions for doing work,btohqsg
