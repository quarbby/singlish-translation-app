why is Citi Rewards preferred over HSBC revolution?,btohqsg
More versatile  no need worry about MCC as much as HSBC Revo  and also cause points credited way faster,btohqsg
oh and shelf life of your points,btohqsg
Doesnâ€™t HSBC revolution have more MCC available?,btohqsg
Hey guys Iâ€™m looking at the Citibank sign up rewards. Understand that citibrewards give 4mpd however the sign up bonus is not as great as Citi premier miles. As Iâ€™m a new to bank customer  shld I sign up for Citi miles first then cancel then apply for rewards?,btohqsg
and what about DBS Womenâ€™s card VS Citi Rewards,btohqsg
HSBC revo is whitelist  CRMC is blacklist,btohqsg
Why not get both ðŸ˜‚(Personally  my citi premiermiles is to compliment my CRMC),btohqsg
DBS WWMC also for online spend but DOES NOT work with amaze  so that limits it alot,btohqsg
meaning i max my CRMC liao  HSBC Revo liao  THEN i use my Citi PM (Or to use with CitiPayAll),btohqsg
HSBC revo only INCLUDES certain MCCs for 4mpd  CRMC is travel + usual EXCLUSIONS,btohqsg
Those with known MCCs and if ok - HSBC RevoCRMC w Amaze - General spending on stuff that are not so sure of MCCOnce hit 1k on CRMC  switch to Citi PM (For insurance im using AmexGrab but thats nerfed so...),btohqsg
Should I get 1. OCBC 360 Savings Account + Citi Rewards + Instarem Amaze VS 2. UOB One account + UOB One CC?,btohqsg
oh yeah  HSBC compliments Citi Cards in that way (HSBC Revo earns 4mpd for travel-related expenses  but not citi cards from what i understand) so ur hotel booking lah  plane tickets lah..,btohqsg
Depends how u gonna hit the min spend of 500 on UOB One account.. I using debit card for this ðŸ¥²OCBC wise... how u gonna hit the spend criteria wor,btohqsg
for OCBC  not planning to hit the spend criteria,btohqsg
instead  use spending on Citi Rewards  for UOB One  itâ€™ll be the credit card,btohqsg
I see  my own strategy is to use the UOB One debit for insurance premiums (monthly premiums) and simplygo  since those count towards the $500 cap. But believe there are better ways for u to explore (i cant apply more CC atm ðŸ˜‚),btohqsg
yea  I want to ideally only use 1 CC,btohqsg
and OCBC has 3% + interests without card  compared to UOB oneâ€™s 0.6%,btohqsg
but one is for cashback  one is for miles wor... soooooo ~,btohqsg
Howmuch miles do citi premier miles give? Iâ€™m using UOB Privi miles as of the moment,btohqsg
Why debit though? When you can have 3% cashback,btohqsg
opened too many credit cards last year,btohqsg
surprisingly ONE Debit card itself also has cashback (though my strategy was to really use it only for the $500 spend)https://www.uob.com.sg/onecards/uob-one-debit-card.html,btohqsg
ohh  cos of the annual fees ah,btohqsg
"nah  more like  last year activate too many at one shot so ""looked sus"" to bank lo",btohqsg
Nowonder. Thanks for sharing! How about UOB Preferred platinum?,btohqsg
I don't like the fact you got to(1) Dodge UOB$ merchants(2) It's rewarded in blocks of $5 spend,btohqsg
Ahhh I see. Is that a very big consideration for the $5 blocks? I find it quite easy for me or does the 1.20  2.40 kind of expenditure adds up over time?,btohqsg
Iâ€™ve decided to go with OCBC 360 + Debit Card + Citi Rewards Card,btohqsg
CRMC + AMAZEdoes this combo have any rebates for MyRepublic broadband and Phone bill ?,btohqsg
Just thinking. Does anybody think that the cost of the free travel insurance and 2 lounge pass from citipremier miles will offset the cui miles?,btohqsg
Seems like there is no way to use credit card to pay Singlife policy Sian,btohqsg
One off PA should be able to,btohqsg
I just checked with Great eastern they can put in a grabpay card but then again havenâ€™t tried,btohqsg
Only for first premium I think,btohqsg
Subsequent premium for Singlife unable to,btohqsg
Subsequent just donâ€™t pay yearly or monthly,btohqsg
Any way to get rewards for paynow to biz?,btohqsg
Imagine for 19.99 dollar transactions  that alone is 16 miles missing (add-on other possible transactions and u see the problem scaling up),btohqsg
Donâ€™t put in the option to pay yearly giro,btohqsg
See what other options they have  assuming yearly   can pop by their CS centres to pay OTC?,btohqsg
So can pay monthly on the payment portal ?,btohqsg
Thatâ€™s what I did for prudential hospitalisation policy,btohqsg
They have a link for payment and grabpay card works!,btohqsg
Thx I will try on Singlife later !,btohqsg
If I want to buy iPhone with Citi Rewards  can I siam the 1k cap by paying in instalment? Also  how do you guys usually spend your Instarem Points?,btohqsg
i think can use those buy now pay later to split but unconfirmed cause i was asking the same thing  ,btohqsg
Hi everyone  wish to check do anyone know how the GXS pocket work?ðŸ˜…,btohqsg
