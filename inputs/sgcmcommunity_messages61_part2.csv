The w212 was a massive upgrade. Looks way sharper and still pretty modern now,btohqsg
F10 without pops and bangs is like pasta with no cheese,btohqsg
43s are likes the 35s  like a sub brand. More affordable means more boy racers i guess haha,btohqsg
f10 with pops and bangs is like wearing a tuxedo without pants,btohqsg
m5 is spared of course but cannot be the obnoxious machine gun artificial sound kind haha,btohqsg
