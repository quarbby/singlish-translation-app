a lot of my friends did in my hall. and it was really a who want play then go play thing,btohqsg
it's super popular tho so not easy to get enough play time,btohqsg
you can always just book the court on your own time and play with friends,btohqsg
you'll make friends in uni too so,btohqsg
Personally I would say if you wanna try varsity badminton  you can try your own school's badminton team.If not  you can just try hall badminton. More towards the recreational side but yea  equally as ok.,btohqsg
Or if your sch has  you can try the inter school games if your uni has it,btohqsg
Wait this is abt uni badminton right?,btohqsg
"I deleted the msg about ""which uni you went to?""",btohqsg
"And then was like ""oh wait""",btohqsg
But i heard uni sports cca in hall can be intense,btohqsg
I think it depends on which hall you go to,btohqsg
If u choose the right courseðŸ’€,btohqsg
Like there are the chill halls,btohqsg
Yea each hall apparently has different niche,btohqsg
Chill one need find RC / residence,btohqsg
But my favs are chill halls but still come for cca,btohqsg
I dun stay in hall but I joined a cca (not those part of residence one),btohqsg
But i assume he meant as in joining 2 ccas,btohqsg
Torturous. (Ok not rlly but the jc changed the schedule when new principal came in),btohqsg
Some of the student councillors in my school hv 2nd ccaâ€¦i cant imagine,btohqsg
I was amugger toadin jcâ€¦but i didnt really care about that label my classmates gave me,btohqsg
Tbh i was mentally q strong in jc so idk what did uni do to me,btohqsg
I hope u can at least get along w a few people,btohqsg
Like u just need that few friends  then if the rest are idiots  dun really need to care,btohqsg
I think my classes in school were fineâ€¦,btohqsg
That is ok too  some people likes to be alone,btohqsg
I most fear of pe coz i think the only sports i can play is tennis and tchoukball,btohqsg
Speaking of badmintonâ€¦i know yâ€™all know my idol is who lah but i suck at itâ€¦i keep hitting the feather instead of the hard part (funnily the only stroke i can play is serve and smashðŸ¤£),btohqsg
As a strictly optional and a if I got time thing,btohqsg
Ya you dont wanna know how many ccas are chill but end up no one shows up,btohqsg
I mean.. I gotta do my assignments and I am a hall ghost,btohqsg

depends on how far along is the woman into her pregnancy because some abortions if done later than a time frame period recommended it isn't safe for either fetus and even the mother,btohqsg
how to know if you are eligible to donate? i remember that there are some rules in order to donate blood de,btohqsg
if you dunno  dun worry they will do some health check before proceeding,btohqsg
