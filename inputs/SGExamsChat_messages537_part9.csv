i swear...our ecommerce ppl working overtime,btohqsg
What I planning to buy to ship over,btohqsg
i thought there would be a conflict of interest situation..like govt agency towing a broken govt vehicle,btohqsg
Government using government property to do government things not conflict of interest bro,btohqsg
It’s individuals using collective property for personal gain,btohqsg
Or when you are put in a situation where you can make a decision or have influence on the outcome of a process for your individual benefit,btohqsg
Here’s the difference ah:1. If I am a employee of a company  and I am able to make salary arrangements for ppl  and my family member is working under me  I give him high salary. Conflict of interest.,btohqsg
oh nvm...now i know what Emas is  cause i thought emas was responsible for towing your vehicle all the way to a workshop,btohqsg
2. If I am employee of a company but I can’t decide my family member salary. I just pass to him his cheque with his salary. Not a conflict of interest.,btohqsg
basically the difference is the intent,btohqsg
No eh  its more of authority,btohqsg
I mean it’s about the opportunity to show favor or get a personal gain when you should not have done so if it was a stranger,btohqsg
Shit phrasing but essentially it’s theft right,btohqsg
You use a situation to benefit yourself or someone you care about unfairly,btohqsg
If you can give increment or bonus to one guy but give your friend,btohqsg
I mean...the Govt agency can write a false report to say the govt vehicle is totaled when its not...then claim insurance,btohqsg
You should let someone who doesn’t know either people on personal level decide,btohqsg
And who is the one who gain,btohqsg
Government is a concept or system of people who collectively work to further their interests and their stakeholder interests (usually of a nation state),btohqsg
SG bois can't at all relate to this,btohqsg
It’s all tech or tech adjacent roles,btohqsg
Oh got nursing and early childhood also,btohqsg
This is like a given  every year nursing intake for polys keep increasing I thought,btohqsg
Good la  the number of ppl needed only going up also,btohqsg
Think I saw intake of 800 somewhere idk,btohqsg
A Grab driver in S'pore claimed he made S$2 500 to S$3 300 per week  or about S$11 200 a month.➡️https://bit.ly/3pOPgdOFollow us on@mothershipsg,btohqsg
time for me to be a grab driver,btohqsg
Before covid  taxi drivers easily earned 4K,btohqsg
if he works just a normal 9-5 or 8h/day,btohqsg
Also  we dk if he works every day or just 5 days a week. We also have not considered the depreciation of the car and the various costs of the owning a car,btohqsg
well lots of ppl own car and work 9-5 for much less pay,btohqsg
idt that many people earn 7k+ a month....,btohqsg
its like top 40% of sg ppl,btohqsg
so 60% of ppl earn less than that,btohqsg
not comparing w average grabfood deliveryperson,btohqsg
wont we just talking about what if grab drivers just work typical office hours tho,btohqsg
Taxi drivers' incomes were screwed the moment grab and all those booking apps came about,btohqsg
Gg yall I discharge from hospital,btohqsg
u would be surprised  alot earn abt 7k or less also buy car alr,btohqsg
"""not that many"" as in ""not majority""",btohqsg
Let's just put it this way. There are many avenues of income that are sometimes not officially recorded by many people.,btohqsg
u resell stuff on Carousell as a side hustle how to declare,btohqsg
there are also taxed ones  eg overseas income that are already taxed overseas,btohqsg
there are those who part time tuition while working ft,btohqsg
or depending how u see it  some would treat dividends or investment returns as part of income,btohqsg
u can do grab + smt else also,btohqsg
maybe 1 rich guy board ur grab,btohqsg
hv some trust in gdp figures,btohqsg
do u think its lower or higher,btohqsg
actually should dividends be considered as own incomenot going by govt definitions,btohqsg
