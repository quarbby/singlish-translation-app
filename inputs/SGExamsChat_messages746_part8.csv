Think there is always elitist everywhere,btohqsg
How to get motivation to study,btohqsg
Hence we gotta subjugate em and beat down that talent. Have em work in sweatshops,btohqsg
My mum told me the only way out of this is become an elitist,btohqsg
But idk how does that solve any problem,btohqsg
It is idk against my own personality,btohqsg
but no effort confirm no result,btohqsg
Then she was like ‘then dont complain  the world is full of elitist’,btohqsg
ever realised the reverse of diam is also a word?,btohqsg
Aint that the lifestyle they been brought up? I mean can we fault them for thinking this way?,btohqsg
and the four letters of diam  was used to teach kinetic particle theory,btohqsg
Idk about the past but actually tbh,btohqsg
My father always told me that it's not the parents fault nor the child if the child don't want to put in hardwork.You can't fault either because it's life. Some people are born to be hardworking  some are born to be lazier,btohqsg
Her elitism actually motivated me and was the reason why i managed to excel in As,btohqsg
What is ur understanding of elitist,btohqsg
Though once i literaly got fedup and was like ‘A level i will beat u’ tho i know it aint happening,btohqsg
Like looking down on those below them + bragging their idk higher status on those not as intelligent,btohqsg
and why is being elitist = be succesful,btohqsg
But tbh most elitist do end up successful (but not all),btohqsg
what do you understand by elite and what do you understand by elitist,btohqsg
quarks and leptons more interesting to read,btohqsg
why isit u assume everyone who goes elite sch = they are elitist,btohqsg
They grew up in a environment that pushed the elitist rhetoric so much they could not accept their future legacy to not be one..that's why,btohqsg
well life have its own ways,btohqsg
Bruh this is some Sky Castle shit,btohqsg
I see my interactions w them,btohqsg
pre 2017 it was thispost 2017 it isn't,btohqsg
They believed so much that being a elitist meant you were always going to find competition. Competition that could be used to motivate or push you to work hsrder,btohqsg
Some are really a headache to be working w,btohqsg
quarks and leptons are easier to understand as fundamental particles,btohqsg
they like to suka suka change,btohqsg
You can't change mindsets  that I what I've learnt after being brought up in Singapore and the online world,btohqsg
I feel like u are just making up words at this point in a sesquipedalian puddle of gobbledygook.,btohqsg
No matter how hard you try  you will never change mindsets. You can only force actions which in scenarios forces mindsets to change,btohqsg
That's the only way to effectively change mindsets,btohqsg
I just read them to teach lol,btohqsg
Very real! Just needa accept it nd figure a way out,btohqsg
I suspecting they may bring to H2 Physics soon,btohqsg
For bio the bane of our existence is idiots who name their discoveries after themselves,btohqsg
No you dont figure anything out because at the end of the day. You don't have any more say than them,btohqsg
As in u need to somehow find a way to blend in and work well w them,btohqsg
For someone to be forced into a mindset change  that someone must believe they are being forced on by a authority figure that is better than them,btohqsg
Cant be u sulk and then idk what,btohqsg
Brownian was a biologist who somehow got his name into Physics,btohqsg
No point because blending or working with them only builds onto their mindset. Best is to ignore and let them live their life on their own terms,btohqsg
Ah this one is a pickle  technically science wasn't rlly a thing tbh,btohqsg
But in the working world  we always need to work in teams  we cant just ignore them,btohqsg
So we just need to figure something out,btohqsg
U can find Decartes and he will give you a headache,btohqsg
This is vaguely in my memory,btohqsg
