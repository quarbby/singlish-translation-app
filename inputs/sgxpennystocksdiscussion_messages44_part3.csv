I sometimes think our site infiltrated by BB. They know master yuan‚Äôs chart  our buy price n suggested selling prices so they can circumvent our trade. I noticed this happened most of the time this last month or so compared with before. Any feel the same?,btohqsg
So we should create another secret chat to plot against them??? ü§î,btohqsg
Yes im thinking abt this too!,btohqsg
Use this channel to pump fake news to throw them off üôÇ,btohqsg
Not say cannot trade la...just that tmr all those ug shareholders will have their 3x shares in cdp account - so can sell  if want to.Otherwise  if sell bet 29/9 and 1/10  sekali the new shares not yet in cdp account  then buy-in lor.,btohqsg
Sure in one if using cdp account,btohqsg
Lol....üòÖ will get to 1.60 one day...for sure  right Pck?,btohqsg
Yup. Mine in aldy...so tmr can sell  if I want lor...but I am keeping....for when it powers up!!!,btohqsg
It is mid-autumn tonite - can pray pray. .. full moon some more,btohqsg
Ok. We cannot outsmart BBs but we can outwit them  can or not?,btohqsg
Later newcomers cannot differentiate real n fake news how?,btohqsg
Too many form a secret group to plot against bbAnd become sgx pennies stocks discussion 2.0,btohqsg
Now  it‚Äôs just overall sentiments bad. Can‚Äôt really do much.2 months ago  money was easy to be made.Meantime  we will monitor for that change of sentiments.That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt seeHeegulanyhow making calls this week also. Because he don‚Äôt spot BBs activity.I think be patient  market can‚Äôt be down down down down down . There will be up days where we can make back for the down days.,btohqsg
This thread is getting to be a CSI thread....lol,btohqsg
Far from itLike stating the obvious such asMoon is round tonight.,btohqsg
In olden days everything unable to explain can attribute to spirits and ghostsNow is bb and shortist,btohqsg
True...true...boss...market sentiment is fragile. Price swing can be within 10mins....scary....no clear signs of uptrend. Goes up...then back down again.Btw  thanks for this thread üëç,btohqsg
But we believe some BB got burnt.badly too,btohqsg
Yup  hopefully üôèüèª we get a couple bullish days by next week and capitalise on it.Free up and ready the ammo. Now   we are on the sidelines. Just gotta Stay prepared and be ready to fire when the sentiments turn.,btohqsg
Huh? BB can get roasted also?,btohqsg
BBs fight BBs too. We never know.There‚Äôs a BBs who wants to play the long and another BBs who wants to play the short.Which side has more bullets wins .Lol.Meantime  we just wanna fight the right camp to join in as mercenaries to ride their efforts,btohqsg
Yup... we want to ride on the coat tails of the right and also merciful BBs üòÖ,btohqsg
You said it best. We are just trying to join and steal some of the gains,btohqsg
Just an old man  hoping to generate some income for his twilight years.,btohqsg
Of course....we cannot be BBs but we can tag along....and hopefully for free and not pay (in terms of losses),btohqsg
