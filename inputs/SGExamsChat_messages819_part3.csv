Wyatt do internship why u nua,btohqsg
Because wyatt want to do fyp,btohqsg
So he needs to do 10 weeks internship either this summer or next summer,btohqsg
But i wanna do professional internship so i get to nua,btohqsg
Your GPA that good that u can not do meh?,btohqsg
Why tf would u wanna do that,btohqsg
B-because i dont want to do an fyp?,btohqsg
then u want to do FYI?,btohqsg
Spms has either fyp + small internship or full sem internship,btohqsg
is it final year internship more common? idk coz my course has both FYI and FYP,btohqsg
Isn't FYP a condition for FCH and Second Upper?,btohqsg
oh i tot it is either internship or FYP,btohqsg
But FCH and second upper is not even in my horizon,btohqsg
Pretty sure as long as got the word Distinction need FYP one,btohqsg
You could not do fyp and graduate with 2nd upper,btohqsg
But fch is a must to do fyp and get A-,btohqsg
U have to follow Si Yan do FYP then do PhD after,btohqsg
Even si yan will laugh at this statement,btohqsg
I already glad my gpa starts with 3,btohqsg
I aint doing no gay ass fyp,btohqsg
Okay that remains to be seen,btohqsg
Sekali i need that 10AU to pull up my gpa,btohqsg
Mine is like below 3.6 I think u cannot even do FYP,btohqsg
I think mine has no strict limit on the gpa,btohqsg
Edit: I was wrong it was higherFYP will remain a pre-requisite for the Honours (Highest Distinction) andHonours (Distinction) degree.â€¢ FYP eligibility depends on your cumulative grade-point average (CGPA) at theend of your 3rd year:â€¢ 3.90 or above: FYP is mandatory.â€¢ 3.75 â€“ 3.89: You can opt-in to do your FYP  but itâ€™s NOT REQUIRED.â€¢ below 3.75: FYP is not allowed  required to read two Level 4000 modulesto fulfill the 8 AUs requirement.,btohqsg
If u take away the S for school u get PMS,btohqsg
You can still get 2nd upper without fyp but thats the cap. Even you 5.00 but never do fyp  you still grad with 2nd upper,btohqsg
It's a school that is always in PMS,btohqsg
Eh? Isn't like Research the foundational aspects and selling point of Physics and Maths?,btohqsg
The only D I can get is the grade in my transcript,btohqsg
Some people (like me) couldnt care less about research and just want to get into the industry asap,btohqsg
Not everyone wanna be oppenheimer in here,btohqsg
What df is in the physics industry,btohqsg
(Anything that an engineer does teehee),btohqsg
Pretty sure to be a Professional Engineer a Physics degree is not recognised as Engi,btohqsg
Theres always a lot of different options,btohqsg
You know who is one of the top hiring companies for SPMS?,btohqsg
You know who accepts 60% of SOH graduates?,btohqsg
top 3 was MOE SAF and something,btohqsg
We end up become Pen Pushers,btohqsg
I think it was public service  not saf tho ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
No fr its the SAF logo,btohqsg
And i think im gonna retain,btohqsg
Ehh no it was super recent,btohqsg
I have the brochure as a coaster in hall,btohqsg
Dk where I put the brochure liao,btohqsg
I may be joining the kawai y4 boy batch,btohqsg
u are planning too far ahead  there is still promos + im not sure about DHS promo criteria but it is actually damn hard to fail the promos criteria in TM,btohqsg
Funnily enough I think the GES for my course might be actually higher than yours,btohqsg
U literally have to be the bottom 5%,btohqsg
