theres rly rly rly no pt,btohqsg
Is this ur final year of retaking?,btohqsg
dude go sleep early  wake up early then go and read thru ur concepts,btohqsg
I tried memorise for a few months already,btohqsg
The graph can memorise really fast,btohqsg
honestly i cannot rmb what graph isit,btohqsg
ngl depends on how well uk urself ah,btohqsg
i can function ok w 2hrs of sleep but after the paper i confirm toh,btohqsg
so if ur ok w that u can pull all nighters if cannot right u better dont force,btohqsg
need to know ur own limits and sleep cycle,btohqsg
yep i did that for last year slept 1 hour haha,btohqsg
I thot emath the graphs are roughly the same,btohqsg
If u did emaths u shd know,btohqsg
Waste my youth for o level,btohqsg
mayb for exponential graphs u may wanna try understanding how it works?,btohqsg
u increase ur x value  ur y value increase more,btohqsg
my advice is watching youtube videos explaining the graphs,btohqsg
so the shape will correspond ah,btohqsg
or i see those graphs memes,btohqsg
got people do before so u can use those,btohqsg
But it's just 2 marks normally so it's ok if u dont,btohqsg
then u shld do ok la,btohqsg
Ya then part b is simultaneously,btohqsg
I think i need focus my calculus and area undergraph,btohqsg
u cant get the shape correct,btohqsg
I mean part a dk graph shape,btohqsg
Yea they wont be so unreasonable. If not just use ur wrong graph. They shd give ecf,btohqsg
how does it affect your intersection point,btohqsg
cant you just use the equations provided and solve?,btohqsg
If not skip first and if u got time just plot it slowly,btohqsg
I saying even if no graph can get behind mark wat,btohqsg
but graph is quite a small part of the exam,btohqsg
i think trigo and calc more important,btohqsg
I hope they give us what to plot..,btohqsg
How many marks does it take to get A1 for amaths?,btohqsg
go memorise ur trigo graphs esp tangent,btohqsg
i say b4 i got my linear law wrong,btohqsg
the rest im pretty sure i got it right,btohqsg
but it was a long qn,btohqsg
1 qn wrong how is that possible thou,btohqsg
or maybe some presentation marks off? or careless?,btohqsg
cuz for the most part i got it right,btohqsg
But highly unlikely will ask for transformation of tan x graph,btohqsg
I dont think linear law can push u down 3 grades lol,btohqsg
its not hard but when they start playing with the graph... i cant ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Guys for pvt candidate can wear short pants,btohqsg
i said i got A2 wym,btohqsg
Like sketch y = tan 2x - 3,btohqsg
Oh I thot u said b4,btohqsg
Just modify same like sin and cos,btohqsg
