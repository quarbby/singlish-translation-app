The only ball your dad plays isyour savings,btohqsg
In fields of green where children play Lestins balls bounce and sway.Bright and round  they soar so high Kissing clouds in the azure sky.They dance on winds with joyful cheer A symbol of fun  drawing near.Through laughter and the morning's light They bring delight from day to night.Colors vivid  spirits lift A simple toy  a precious gift.For in the bounce and gentle fall Lies the magic of Lestins balls.,btohqsg
