No changes to Covid-19 local measures for now  too early to tell if tightening needed: Lawrence WongNovember 30  2021 1:59 PMSINGAPORE - There will not be any changes to Covid-19 community restrictions for now  even as Singapore steps up its border measures amid reports of the new Omicron variant Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Tuesday (Nov 30).Read more:https://bit.ly/2ZCYAUZ,btohqsg

Singapore tightens border measures  halts further easing of social measures over Omicron variant fears1. The relaxation of social measures will be paused  and travellers entering Singapore will face stricter rules from 11.59pm on Thursday (Dec 2)  as the country acts to buy time amid the spread of the new Omicron variant around the world.2. The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday that while no cases of Omicron - found in South Africa last week - have been detected locally  the pre-emptive measures are needed for Singapore to assess the implications of the new variant. They will also help to reduce the risk of importation of the virus.3. From 11.59pm on Thursday  air travellers arriving on the quarantine-free Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) scheme will have to undergo supervised  self-administered antigen rapid tests at a Quick Test Centre on days three and seven of their arrival.More here,btohqsg

Moderna CEO Sparks Slump Reiterating Omicron May Need New Shots1. The plethora of mutations in the omicron variant are likely to help it evade the protection provided by existing vaccines  making it necessary to develop new immunizations  Moderna Inc. Chief Executive Officer Stephane Bancel told the Financial Times  triggering a pullback in risk assets.2. There is no way the current shots will provide the same level of protection against omicron as they do against delta  and there will be a material drop in their efficacy  he said.3. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know how much because we need to wait for the data ‚Äù Bancel was quoted as saying. ‚ÄúAll the scientists I‚Äôve talked to‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ. are like ‚Äòthis is not going to be good‚Äù‚ÄôMore here,btohqsg

üß®A New Headwind is Appearing‚õΩÔ∏èüí∏USD strength gaining Tractionüí∞The US Dollars have been gaining strength  and often this does not bode well for the US market. Since the start of the year  we have taken a contrarian view of the US dollars- while a majority of the people had expected a weaker USD  we have called for a firmer dollar. The case of a weaker dollar was easy. The sizeable fiscal spending will require a large treasury volume  which will likely increase the money supply and thus weaken the USD.ü™úOur Contrarian TakeüìªHowever  this did not turn out to be true because the issuance of the treasury is relatively stable  and much of the pandemic stimulus set aside during the Trump era was not entirely spent. Moreover  a somewhat volatile political and economic environment encourages investors to park funds in a haven like the USD. Higher inflation also boosts the prospect of an interest rate hike  which promotes the dollar's strength relative to other currencies. These factors have generally strengthened the USD.üìàUSD and its impact on EquityüîçCompanies tend to use a stronger dollar as a reason for poorer performance. After all  S&P 500 companies generally derive 40% of their revenue from international markets  and their revenue tends to reduce in value when converted back in USD from other currencies. A small number of companies appear to have started speaking about the negative impact of a strong USD on their earnings in the future.While the above reasons seem logical and compelling  Pika World believes that the reason could be one of convenience than in reality for the poor performance of corporate earnings. If we observe the current market condition  the strong USD had not dented the equity market. The S&P 500 return for the year thus far is around 24%  about three times its historical average.üßÆExpenses and HedgingüîíA stronger dollar is not an absolute negative for companies. Indeed  on the revenue end  it might make the figure smaller. Still  on the expenses side  companies with a significant international presence also tend to have considerable operations paid in nondollar currencies. Hence  these expenses may also look smaller when converted in USD. Furthermore  many MNCs tend to hedge some level of currency exposures and may deter material impacts of currency fluctuation into their earnings.As the earnings seasons continue  we may gain more insights from corporate leaders on their woes with a strong USD  and perhaps at times  we can take with a pinch of salt the prominent role of USD in affecting revenue.We hope you enjoy this latest insight and have a restful evening.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

üöÄPika World on DemandüöÄ‚åõÔ∏èOur Greatest FearüèÄStocks plunged on Tuesday after Uncle Powell spoke on the idea of speeding up the bond tapering to combat inflation. It comes at a sensitive time when the market is worried about the Omicron variant. Equities reacted aggressively. The Dow dropped by 1.9% together with S&P 500. Nasdaq fell by 1.6%.ü•âA weak Footingüí∏The market was already jittered when major vaccine producers discussed the weaker effect of vaccines and treatment against the Omicron variant. The sell-off accelerated as Uncle Powell spoke in the Senate Banking Committee on the possible discussion in December on tapering momentum.üí∞Dollar Hintüí≥10 years treasury yield had fallen to 1.42%  the lowest on the day and recovered to 1.44% after tapering news. The dollar movement perhaps hints at the market‚Äôs guess on a faster tapering. When bond yields fall  the US dollar often weakens as well as investors purchase fewer dollars when the US bonds become less juicy.Although the US Dollar index fell by 0.4% on the day  it is still above the intraday low. The sudden rise reflects market participants seeing US bond yields moving higher as the Fed starts to buy lesser bonds which could theoretically press down bond prices and push up yields.üíéRussell 2000üíéThe favourite of Pika World Russell 2000 is perhaps on the pivotal point towards correction. It is down about 9% from its high in early November. Small caps tend to be more sensitive to economic demand  and therefore  tapering if it leads to reduced demand tend to have a more pronounced impact on the index.Pika World maintains cautious bull on the market.We hope you enjoy this read! Pika World will be back with you on the next big move.Cheers Pika Nat.,btohqsg

"üçïPika World Lunch Break ‚Äì 1 Dec 2021üçüüíäOur Dear Uncle Powellüß∏It wasn't that long since Uncle Powell was nominated as the Fed chairman for a second team. His talk about retiring the word ""transitory"" on the nature of inflation spoke fear across markets on Tuesday.Wall Street was caught off-guard  sending major indices to fall sharply. Moreover  it was a pivotal point that market participants did not see it coming. After all  the taper plan was just announced a month ago and that the Fed had just implemented it about 2 weeks ago.The abrupt gear change reflects the uneasiness and weakening patience among FOMC members on the enduring inflation that seems more persistent than thought.At Pika World  we believe consistent with most articles and readings  two things have perhaps changed.ü™Ç#1: Unleash the Animal SpiritüèãüèΩThere is a strong inclination for Uncle Powell to declare openly on his thoughts and tools available to tackle inflation. After all  his nomination is confirmed  and he does not need to be tied down by Progressive Democrats in Washington that had been eyeing for Fed Governor Brainard to take up the post.It should be a piece of good news that Uncle Powell can stretch his muscle and tame inflation before it leaves a more permanent scar than desired.‚õ≥Ô∏è#2: Beware  I am still hereüõéThe Omicron variant is a shout to global leaders that the pandemic isn't over after months of peace in dealing with Covid-19. In his testimony to the Senate Banking Committee  Uncle Powell had changed how he viewed the risks that were building up.Till today  governments have been more concerned about economic growth than inflation. After all  Covid worried consumers had dampened normal activities that would have otherwise contributed to more vibrant spending. Workers are also hesitant to return to work when infection fear is real. Therefore  the Fed has been more concerned about full employment than inflation fear.üìâA Change of Perceptionü™úBased on his latest testimony  it appears that the dual prong mandate focus is now tilted more towards inflation. There was discussion on supply chains woes  shortage and its effect on prices. Given that the unemployment rate is now at a low rate  it is perhaps logical for him to switch focus on prices level in the economy.On a general note  the Fed appears to be more hawkish than anticipated  and the market felt uncomfortable by the undercurrent of the shift in thought. Since markets are forward-looking  there is huge pricing on the higher possibility of the first-rate hike in 2022. The fight between the Omicron variant and inflation affecting the arrival of the first hike is to be seen.Till then  Pika World will bring you the latest insights.We hope you enjoy this read. Bon Appetit.Cheers Pika Nat.",btohqsg
