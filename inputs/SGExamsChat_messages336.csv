But i'd be lying if i said ppl did the same for me,btohqsg
Yeah  that's how I overcame my fear of cockroaches by observing them in my heartbreak phase,btohqsg
At the same time  you ought to realise that you need to give them some space for them to strive for themselves too (:,btohqsg
I choose to not expect anything from anyone and appreciate anything they would do for me - small or big (:,btohqsg

Is there anyone applying for vet tech tp eae wanna ask some qns:),btohqsg
hi! i also want to know if anyone here has gotten into poly through eae and if they have any tips to share? ^^,btohqsg
I only got through DPA  back then no aptitude test but got writeup and interview,btohqsg
Most importantly is to be clear on what you want to learn and gain from the diploma,btohqsg
And be able to convey it verbally,btohqsg
oh i'm only aware of jae  eae  dsa  jie and daeis it the same as dae?,btohqsg
When I googled  it was 2012  so might have changed name to dae,btohqsg
If no need air con  lots of public spaces around.,btohqsg
Hullo! EAE’ed into NP’s Business Studies  here are some tips!1. Make your write-up realAs much as you’d want to make your writeup & portfolio look amazing  it has to be you. When you get to the interview portion later  you’ll need to be able to communicate the same story you wrote down.2. Be assuredYou know yourself best  and you know why you chose the course. There isn’t any room to doubt what you’re sharing about yourself. In group interviews  also keep in mind that it isn’t a one-upping competition within the group.3. Present your alignment wellEmbrace the parts that make you unique. Be sure to highlight what makes you so special for the course  and what makes the course special to you.This is to do with relevancy & impact. ie. beyond school  you took up an apprenticeship in <insert industry here> So rather than focusing on your sec sch experience  tap into this unique thing that is more relevant to your course.4. Present yourself wellAbove all  be kind & polite. A warm greeting  small talk & good etiquette are simple things that are often overlooked.,btohqsg
I do know some people who EAEd into courses like In’t trade and logistics as well as nursing.,btohqsg
guys are chest pains and breathlessness normal aft u recover frm illnesses,btohqsg
then u js let it be ah,btohqsg
yes  that's why don't do strenuous exercises,btohqsg
last time I sec 4  mild flu and I still went to run 2.4km.  Too garang.I was giddy and out of breath for a long time after that and cannot focus in class.,btohqsg
It's the previous version of EAE,btohqsg
oh that's cool! do you know what they've done to get in?i guess i know somewhat the basic procedure but any details would help!,btohqsg
Yes. The write up gotta be convincing and also you appear enthusiastic during the interview phase. Also do some research on the course you are going for.,btohqsg
aptitude test is like depend on course thoo,btohqsg
Anyone planning to go overseas to study ?,btohqsg
currently looking at UK and Aus,btohqsg
Which unis r u considerimh though,btohqsg
Hi wanted to ask so like if I’m applying for eae and cuz of covid I could not do a lot of voulenteer work and like Olympiads will the people who accept the application give leniency on it n also for the 600 character write up is the space also counted,btohqsg
Apparently i look like amos yee,btohqsg
age on the clock old enough for _ _ _ _,btohqsg
I need to cut my hair short so it matches my old IC pic,btohqsg
you dont  honestly they know people change from time to time  they will just update,btohqsg
and yes  this is the verification process,btohqsg
Apple ‘s rolling out IDs to iPhone ‘s built-in Wallet app.,btohqsg
Even more convenient than the standalone Singpass app,btohqsg
Lol i look like a girl now sadge,btohqsg
SG won’t get this feature yet. They are starting with U.S first so it ‘s okay to wait lo.,btohqsg
haven't decided yet haha my UCAS application is partially filled,btohqsg
but am looking at polsci+ ir,btohqsg
why say cant sleep all then like,btohqsg
Just like those friends who only beg for attention yet do not want the interaction...,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/h2CXLzv8ios(For those who would like to know more about EAE),btohqsg
Just a quick question  which JCs offer the JC2 repeat program?,btohqsg
is whether or not they have ppl who need to retake,btohqsg
thats a very funny assumption to make then,btohqsg
I have taken a HCI J2 repeat student before.,btohqsg
theres a diff between “offer” and “not offering”,btohqsg
vs “having students retake in j2” or not,btohqsg
YI only allow 1 U grade people and above to retake as sch candidates,btohqsg
whether or nt the sch would want them back tho..,btohqsg
All schools are good schools. 😃,btohqsg
i know that some schools are very stringent on it,btohqsg
That's why only 1 U grade or more,btohqsg
at least mi claims to be really strict on it,btohqsg
the ppl yk ≠ everyone right,btohqsg
brings me back to the same message u sent,btohqsg
theres adistinctdifference between claiming that only shitty schools provide the option to retake j2 vsfactually pointing outthat all schools provide the option to retake j2,btohqsg
it’s really flawed to make that statement yk that,btohqsg
just because the percentage of ppl who decide to actually retake j2 regardless of whether or not its bad grades or personal reasons may differ from school to school  doesn’t necessarily imply that only “shitty” schools can’t retake it,btohqsg
because u’re spitting out things that aren’t even right?,btohqsg
have the capacity to understand what i just said,btohqsg
i think i’ve already said it in a reallyyyy easy to digest manner,btohqsg
To dispel your misconception  every JC has it.,btohqsg
I think is common knowledge. Quite sad that someone who may have studied in JC and graduated from it to be oblivious to such a fact lol... I believe almost every1 knows,btohqsg
"""every school is a good school"" -minister heng swee keat",btohqsg
Wow EAE only can apply 3 courses but won't so lucky call up for 3 interviews?,btohqsg
Only know if hv offer would be 1 course,btohqsg
I received interviews for 2 of them,btohqsg
i heard ppl saying nj is shit,btohqsg
on the other hand ofc there are ppl saying things like how nj is a rlly good sch,btohqsg
u think i think who thonk,btohqsg
got a few ppl leh reference unclear,btohqsg
Sorry guys i forward wrong place,btohqsg
I forwarded a bad meme here. On catgirls,btohqsg
Admins can check deleted msgs anyw,btohqsg
uve been posting irrelevant and disturbing shit ever since I saw u in this group,btohqsg
hi guys  do yall know of any tourism organisations in sg who marketed their services differently during covid 19?,btohqsg

hello  anyone knows python? can help me explain whats wrong w this and how i shld be fixing it,btohqsg
wait is this even the right gc LOL,btohqsg
what value is the variable before you attempted to cast it? could it be an uninitialized value? the error will only be there if the value is infinity or NA,btohqsg
I think you need to give more context into your dataset?I might be wrong but seems like your data set has infinite numbers in it (e.g. pi) so it can't force it into the integer data type,btohqsg
uhh i just checked through it  its all integer numbers though,btohqsg
for this i have to convert to the correct data types but theres the error statement,btohqsg
and google suggested i use the numpy,btohqsg
try checking the value of that specific variable with print(),btohqsg
i did at the code just before that  and its wrong so i have to use astype,btohqsg
Anyone did 1for1 exchange for logitech products at Kaira Tech?,btohqsg

Anyone has gone / is in an overseas university  preferably UK or australia mind Pm me about your experience? im considering it but not sure if i want to,btohqsg
For this  does it technically mean that I do not have to use my sciences scores? or what? Still in a blur.,btohqsg
this is a requirement for the course. it really depends what type of course and what subj u r taking. for computation of elr2b2  u hv to look at the aggregate type table to be sure,btohqsg
They'll take your english + maths + next top 2 subjects,btohqsg
Not top 2. It must be in the category of  aggregate type C-,btohqsg

Ok would just try but somehow don't know what to put in portfolio,btohqsg
