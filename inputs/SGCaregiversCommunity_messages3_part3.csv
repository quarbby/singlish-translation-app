Hi admin  thanks for the reply.I am a full time healthcare frontliner who is holding on to part time degree .I had been trying very hard to maintain the caregiver position since i was 18 ( 25 now) . I had recently decided to enrol the 2 elderlies ( 92 yr old with ckd  dementia  heart issue in day care pending initial assessment- not sure about the success as she kept changing her decision n mood towards it)   (67 yr old with long term childhood dystonia  recent multiple compression fractures  dementia - undergoing day 3 of day care) Being tapping on AIC payout but as he requires help daycare suggested medical escort approx $100 extra per month. Though it is within AIC payout the mum (92 ) is unhappy with it and threatens to withdraw him becos of cost. Both are not gait steady.Tried ICS which works - contract ended yesterday and unable to extend. Trial helper which she fired 2 within 6 mths .I am at lost. I need help with looking after them as well as to juggle with appointments as is just too many as i am a main caregiver for 4 of them .,btohqsg
I am drained becos both of them are completely opposite .. one does not want to eat ( cost concern though is affordable . Insisted to eat a piece of bread for 2 meals) while the other is constantly hungry,btohqsg
Thank you for sharing Li Hui. I‚Äôll let the rest of the community to chip in accordingly.Meanwhile  let me PM you to see if my end we can help u to access to more help ok?,btohqsg
Hi Li Hui  is there a medical social worker you are in touch with who can help you explore your options?,btohqsg
It is not easy but do try to find time to take care of yourself too. It is tough to pour from an empty cup.,btohqsg
Thank you so much faith. Adrian had spoken to me about it. My msw found medical escort but they told me that is not available for appointments and the earliest will be in oct depending on availability,btohqsg

Hi  anyone have any idea where to get a wheelchair for elder but not too pricey?,btohqsg
You can also search onhttps://www.carousell.sg/. My suggestion is to look at prices for new ones so that you can compare if the second hand ones are worth paying.If your loved one has to be on the wheelchair all the time  then get one that's comfortable for sitting longer hours. My elder can still walk short distances so I got her a light and portable one as it's easy to transport in taxis. The smaller and lighter ones are not comfortable for sitting long hours.,btohqsg
Go willing hearts they may have those donated by others,btohqsg
Preloved wheelchair  self-collect at 600050 on weekends  but can coordinate.A friend/ fellow caregiver of mine is giving away.,btohqsg
