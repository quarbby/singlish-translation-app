There is a catch. UOB version of Expedia may be more expensive (from same price to 5-7% from my experience). Double check the price every time u book.,btohqsg
How did u know not able to?,btohqsg
But I suppose itâ€™s still one of the better ways to earn miles on flights? Or any other credit card?,btohqsg
Strange. Try writing in to uob,btohqsg

If you plan to use it to pay your insurance and income tax  can use CardUp platform as well,btohqsg
Yes I went to UOB TMR to activate it,btohqsg
Lets see what uob says ba,btohqsg
This is good choice.  Good for hospital bills private.. mostly can't already for other bank. I heard only scb can,btohqsg
U earn miles but u paying more for it. U shud see whats your valuation of miles and determine from there,btohqsg
See if the 5% increase in price justify extra 2mpd,btohqsg
So perhaps a normal HSBC revolution book directly w SQ might make more sense,btohqsg
Haha I try to apply  but aft Singpass I get 404 error. Shld I apply directly via UOB or MoneySmart?,btohqsg
Can I use UOB absolute Cashback credit card to pay insurance and medical bills? Is there any exclusion?,btohqsg
I'm plan to do this also.EGA new open approve on 28th May  I send register on 29th May  I no need to register again on June for the 4.45%  right? I only start fund in on 1st June .,btohqsg
Btw any mile chasers enticed by dbs yuu 18% enough to switch to cashback?,btohqsg
Does this mean 6mpd is back?,btohqsg
It was enticing at the start but now I realised how difficult it is to find giant near me ðŸ˜‚ so don't use anymore,btohqsg
Should I upgrade solitaire to metal card?,btohqsg
https://www.uob.com.sg/personal/cards/rewards/ladys-card/index.pageIf u pair w ladys savings and has min depo,btohqsg

No itâ€™s in pairing with ladyâ€™s savings acc for certain deposit amount,btohqsg
I actually like the new hsbc app  shows the points break down  but then still wish they would show the bonus points breakdown too,btohqsg
U guys like to make baseless assumptions. What do u guys gain from it? Like i said i am just sharing what happened for people to avoid similar pitfalls and i dont gain anything from it.,btohqsg
I pay my credit cards bills in full every month on time and i NEVER advance cash from credit cards,btohqsg
Chill bro. Just making guesses on the possible reason why you are targeted. Will stop since you take offence over it. Peace!,btohqsg
In 2000 i was the first teacher below age of 25 to declare 1mill income and pay income tax and it came out in the papers. U dont know me so dont talk shit,btohqsg
"All these rotations ""profits"" are small money but i just like the fun of maximizing this kind of thing. Its like a game to me",btohqsg
Hi all which credit card should i use for petrol? Miles or cashback?Was looking at miles cc only applicable one i can find is uob ladys card under travel with kris+,btohqsg

We were the original batch of Super Tutors and i was the only one still in MOE as a scholar. Had to leave MOE when i got featured in the papers,btohqsg

The money doesnt matter. Just buay song how the bank just close it. If they have proof of crime then it wont be closing account it will be frozen account (for those ignorant people who like to shoot their mouth off),btohqsg
It should be under transport not travel,btohqsg
I will say they have the rights to not having business relationship with you. Just like you have the rights to not having business relationship with them as well. Aka boycott. Nothing you else can do.,btohqsg
I get closed by maybank for small amt in and out also,btohqsg
Yup they have the right. So i only appealed. Just feel buay song thats all. And share with the group for the benefit of those who think moving money for rotation is 100% safe. Its not.,btohqsg
My condolences. Banks r for profit organisations. They can take advantage of others but they dont like to be taken advantage of.,btohqsg
No need reason to close  You already say èŽ«é¡»æœ‰,btohqsg

Anyone gotten this from tiger? Can't seem to find what the maximum amount to be kept for the 6.8%.,btohqsg
You will need more than 1 card since the bonus miles is usually cap at 1k and depends what your monthly spending of 8k comprises of,btohqsg
Please read the card tnc for cashback explain,btohqsg
