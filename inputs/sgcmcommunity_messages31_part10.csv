Yes.Camrynow ~199k  century sprint 8.5 sec + good FCAccordnow ~215k  century sprint 9.1 sec + cheap road taxMazda6 2.0 now ~166k  century sprint 10.8 sec + worse FC than camry & more expensive road tax than AccordMaybe that 30 - 50k savings from Mz6 can offset the FC + road tax over 10 years? Can see in that way,btohqsg
