#AbundanceRecently we have seen a lot of stocks with this type of 1-day ultra long range bar and heavy volume.Using other charts as reference  moving forward  it should at best fluctuate within the yellow box for now.Should have realistic expectation on target price for now.,btohqsg

Anywhere above your EP can be TP  subj to individual trading plan.I am just sharing to be realistic (based on my observation on other similar pattern) and better don't hold with the expectation to aim for the sky.Unless a person prefer to hold  then that's his choice.,btohqsg

"#AsiaOne#Singapore2 crabs for $9.99? TikToker warns about scam after it resurfaces onlineJuly 24  2021 at 03:55PMSingaporeans love a good deal and will not pass up on discounts especially when they involve food. However  those craving for crabs should beware of a scam offering two crabs for $9.99 that's recently circulating on TikTok. TikTok user Melissawix said she almost fell for the scam  and posted a video on Friday (July 23) night to warn others about it. ""Previously they called themselves Crabber Restro  now they've changed it to Jack Crab and they're offering crabs at ridiculously low prices "" she said. In her video  she showed the cheap deals listed under ""Crab Delivery Singapore"" offered by Jack Crab Restro on TikTok. The address given  175 Bencoolen Street  is Burlington Square. There's no store with such a name when AsiaOne checked the building's directory but Jack Crab is the name of a restaurant in the United States that closed down in April this year.https://ift.tt/370cCjwMore athttps://t.me/NewsRoomSG",btohqsg
