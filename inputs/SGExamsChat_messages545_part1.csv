Evidence..try to get as much evidence as you can..not being a involved party  that is all you can do right now,btohqsg
Its all about building up a case,btohqsg
i dont understand the victim's mentality,btohqsg
and still think he will change,btohqsg
like i know its hard for most people to comprehend,btohqsg
ill help you understand..it has very simillar reasonings to a parental and child connection..Like some people just wont leave their parents even though they know they get abused by them,btohqsg
my gf and I we even offer to let her stay at our place,btohqsg
Afraid she wonâ€™t experience the same love he GAVE her previously,btohqsg
I got a feeling she is fearful 100%,btohqsg
esp since sheâ€™s under her bf control rn,btohqsg
she isnâ€™t rly open to the outside world per say,btohqsg
then she was like huh you didnt even text me,btohqsg
then i see that guy deleted the messages on her phone,btohqsg
i legit cant understand why males mostly do this..like  even to their parents some guys are like this,btohqsg
i honestly feel like crying tbvh out of empathy,btohqsg
they themself have the fear of losing someone who support them lor,btohqsg

im trying to not go there,btohqsg
"the dv victim  place some blood on the gates of her door before she knew she was abt to ""get it"" from the husband",btohqsg
so noise complaint  police turn up...see blood on the gates  case closed,btohqsg
i mean told him the short answer to the qns was basically nothing,btohqsg
but he could gather evidence on the sidelines,btohqsg
yea..but i think if one day can get some concrete evidence..then it would be good..better than nothing?,btohqsg

Singapore police seize S$1 billion in property  luxury cars and other items as part of a forgery and money laundering probe.10 people were arrested in the raids at Good Class Bungalows and condos.https://cna.asia/47Bd8CQ,btohqsg
im very sure this is not a rare occurence,btohqsg
sorry there arent many GCBs in singapore ah,btohqsg
how was this not flagged out earlier,btohqsg
i rmb reading cases of sg seizing whole ships..im pretty sure those are worth more than 1billion,btohqsg
bruh im just talking facts...im not even guessing,btohqsg
I mean yea there has been a period of time where nothing was seized,btohqsg
Detain and seizing got differences im sure..but  assets wise i dont think the number is that far off,btohqsg
But dont these meant that if these ships dont pay  singapore can seize them indefinitely,btohqsg
idk enough..but i just did not see the number as being a huge number..cause i know the value of ships,btohqsg
yea maybe i was wrong to say that it was common,btohqsg
I like how the 1bil became 700mil,btohqsg
