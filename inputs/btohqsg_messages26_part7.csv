which project u applied for? just curious,btohqsg
cause usually 30+ out of supply might have a lot more than 11 units left,btohqsg
If one drives  mrt is not an consideration,btohqsg
Not a apple to apple comparsion,btohqsg
Punggol got near SIT University one,btohqsg
The location dynamic also different  too,btohqsg
Your poll very general.Those prefer mrt one sure vote woodland.But those working near Punggol then vote Punggol. Because far from mrt also no Issue since works is already not far away,btohqsg
Where got ppl own self like own poll one,btohqsg
Ya from Oct 2023  if u get called up and reject  penalty is 2nd timer for a year  and subsequent queue no. all cancelled,btohqsg
E.g Feb 2024 u ballot  June 2024 also ballotBoth got queue no. but if Feb 2024 call u up first u reject  June will also be cancelled,btohqsg
In ur own pov. Poll stops once reach 100 votes,btohqsg
Hi everyone  wanted to ask on the parent proximity scheme.The upcoming oct BTO project is within proximity and i will be reciving a grant + an additional vote during ballot. But i dont intend to inform anyone in my family for the BTO application and i am very sure they will not sell during the MOP period.Thing is  will1. HDB notify them without my consent? (Cuz i cant opt out of proxomity)2. What if down the road of 10yrs MOP  they really sold the flat. Ie. Year 7 of MOP they decide to sell  will my unit be at risk?I dont mind the financial losses from grant returns if that is only the max penalty,btohqsg
BTO u dont get extra grant for proximity,btohqsg
But During selection HDB will do video call with ur family,btohqsg
U can actually dont apply for the close proximity  just dont get extra ballot chance only,btohqsg
Thanks a lot for the information  i vaguely recall during the jun launch that i was within proximity  it was auto included. How do i select to remove?,btohqsg
Pretty sure u can just skip the page,btohqsg
I applied once before and skipped the proximity page cause its not compulsory to fill,btohqsg
Maybe OP wants to sell next time üòÇ,btohqsg
Theres tons of better BTOs in Oct,btohqsg
1. If I recall correctly  HDB will notify them if you apply for proximity. If you don't want them to be informed  better not to apply,btohqsg
Hi everyone  to get a roof unit or one Lv below roof. What are the pros n cons of roof unit,btohqsg
Nope similar pricing to bedok. All east area mature estate min this price deRegale much more expensive. BTO cheap le,btohqsg
$550k for the jun tamp bto near tamp Safra riteWhich lvl is that roughly for that price?,btohqsg
Does HDB invite for selection om Sat and sun?,btohqsg
Sat not opened. Sun to Fri,btohqsg
Oh that consider mid floor ard lv 8,btohqsg
Tampines beside safra had >60 application rates. I recalled very highly sought after,btohqsg
That means ur highest floor close to $600k? Ard $580k?,btohqsg
2nd time already. Pls do not advertise here.,btohqsg
Do we get to see the 3d mock up of all btos at toa payoh hub?,btohqsg
When can we make the appt? Launch is this oct but duno when exact date,btohqsg
Pros - privacy  windy  quieterCons - you will be the last one to exit the lift  if the lift breaks down u have to take the stairs and climb all the way up to your house  may have to deal with leakage problem (if you get the older resale unit)So far these are what i gather online..,btohqsg
Find a place where u know people if u buying resale. If lift ever breaks down u have a temp hideout üòÅ,btohqsg
Wa even for my out of supply Q number?So in this case I better go down if I was called for selection  same time will ask for waiver if I didn't select any units. Unless I receive sms before the appt date/time that I don't need to go yo hdb office as ethnic quota reached.,btohqsg
Yup even if it is out of supply. how out though? and how many units left?,btohqsg
Ok thanks for the advise n info. Will see how it goes.,btohqsg
<5 for sbf  <10 for bto,btohqsg
Haha i asking how out is her queue xD,btohqsg
Cause usually for BTO  if is out by 30 ish will have quite a lot of units left,btohqsg
Auto no penalty for bto is <10 units left  or <5 units left,btohqsg
Can share your new proj q no?,btohqsg
If q no is very small n u r a first timer  it is easier to justify to hdb to ask for waiver of penalty.,btohqsg
Hello. I'm confused over this. Hope someone can enlighten me. If the monthly mortgage payment is $2184.My partner and I combined contributions will be only 1500+-. The remaining amount have to pay by cash. However my partner and I want to leave behind 40k(20k each) during the BTO application period.So my question is   the balance amount that we need to pay by cash for our mortgage  can we tap on the 20k we leave behind?,btohqsg
If you are going to tap it  why not just use the 20k for deposit to reduce your interest? Instead of using that amount to pay monthly interest  not the best use of the 20k.,btohqsg
I mean for down payment all I will use the cpf all to payment all,btohqsg
I might need to tap on the 20k to pay for the balance that I may need to pay in cash,btohqsg
You can always adjust how much to pay using cpf/cash any time during the mortgage period.Some may have more cash and decide to use more cash to pay instead of cpf,btohqsg
No clues. Even those who worked in hdb also won't know,btohqsg
