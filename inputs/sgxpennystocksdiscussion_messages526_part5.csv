Some supposed to be quarantined at hotel.. But in the end no one come pick them for 3 days,btohqsg
Headache.. coz my cousin bro.. have body sickness conditions.. if the daughter go quarantine. Ieft his wife at least someone can cook..If worse both of them go quarantine.. I have to take care my cousin bro.. also need 14 days quarantine‚Ä¶,btohqsg
So that means they can start trading those shares tomorrow,btohqsg
cost of rights share = $0.02,btohqsg
for those who have KW but stuck for 2 years at as high as $0.12  if subscribed the rights issue  the avg cost will become $0.07,btohqsg
yes  but some savvy ones would have sold during the run up these few days  while waiting for the rights shares to be credited to their CDP acct.,btohqsg
Yes..good luck those holding/bought at a high,btohqsg
But their arrangement very messy.. hais..Lucky my nephew 2hours they pick him to quarantine..,btohqsg
My friend's daughter close contact with a case previously only she shn. The whole family still can move around. The rule keep changing,btohqsg
Yup! Now very messy.. the issue my cousin bro have medical conditions..can‚Äôt go quarantine at hotel.. so very headache.. see tmr my niece update me..,btohqsg
Don't worry  everything will turn up fine. Jiayou!,btohqsg
the situation is very overwhelming .. delays here and there .. .. MOH and Certis hotlines can never get thru .. .. called like 2am - 5am then got chance .. .. do expect late hours like midnight come to take PCR test  etc,btohqsg
Today they PCR test this morning.. coz my cousin bro have medical conditions.. he can‚Äôt do it too..,btohqsg
Moh hotline always hard to get thru.. tat time may when i make call during sunday cant call thru at all,btohqsg
Even my submit test results also delay for 2 month Liao üòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Defrost from freezer and quickly sell while can,btohqsg

KOP ($0.059/$0.060)- Daily & weekly chart view for reference- This counter getting interesting. Might be another candidate that could fly. Of course  have to see whether recent Penny  market sentiments can maintain- this week will be interesting for KOP. If it can close above 56  it shows a break out on the weekly downtrend line.- Since the last most significant volume on 14th June  it has since rested with removal of liquidity and flush many players. This means that counter is light now with lesser resistance as most have gave up.Watch this once closely  I reckon a big move coming up  within this 2 weeks.DYODD,btohqsg
Buy kopi give free popiah ü§´,btohqsg
Yesterday  some one recommend me buy Lasseters  I see loss making and high debt  that person make more than $35k etc.I miss the big ride. I think sg market as long as no/Low chance to be suspend type  can play when the players come.,btohqsg
KOP players are in  I think they will fly honestly. Aiming 8 series but OTOT  along the way  got profits will take .,btohqsg
KOP will never go down or ever get suspend with Sam Goi in the background.Now illiquid pennies in play   this one suits the theme.,btohqsg
Sam now executive chairman in Hanwell after reorg,btohqsg
https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/kop-sam-goi-in-share-placement-dealFor those who do not already know Poh Piah King üëë Sam Goi is SSH (21.17% of KOP).His $11.1 million investment in 2017 was at $0.050.Flushing over for this counter  it‚Äôs about time. Penny Season is here. Do not leave this one out.üòé,btohqsg
But that was back in 2017.$0.050   $11.1 million worth.He have not sold any since then  I think he bought more along the way,btohqsg
Sam recently bought over Hanwell from ex boss 0.42 huge amount.Market never give face shot down to 0.40 lol,btohqsg
Sam was buying since $0.205 last year.,btohqsg
Anyways  FA is SGX market don‚Äôt play much part  TA and BBs activity triumph FA.,btohqsg
Recently he bought more than $20 million from ex boss,btohqsg
Of course if FA+TA+BBs volume is best combination  but I feel In Sg market   Many don‚Äôt care FA,btohqsg
I used to buy mostly based on FA also,btohqsg
I think Sam have more faith in Hanwell He spent so much to buy back,btohqsg
But most of the time   quite slow really.,btohqsg
Definitely bro This counter I recommend my dad to take also  he made about 60-70k I think,btohqsg
But I asked him to buy at lower prices $0.192 his average only.I like buy when counter is cheap.,btohqsg
Did u buy any HSO bro,btohqsg
Hanwell was the best counter I found and bought last yea,btohqsg
Yea man  I told u not ready   got FA but players not ready,btohqsg
When the time comes I will add another 10-20k lots but now not the time yet,btohqsg
I honest to you I bought 0.004 but can‚Äôt move lol,btohqsg
Wong is selling   but soon he will not be able to put any selling pressure . The 22 k lots in $0.004 most is his. I counter he should have about 140 - 180 mil shares left though.Actually now much already 560k to 720k can eat him finish.,btohqsg
Yea man  he is the only selling pressure. BBs taking their time to absorb him. We will just have to wait haha,btohqsg
When time come   wait my cue bro. We will hoot big and revenge.Prepare 10k to 20k lots hoot type. Okay üí™üèº,btohqsg
Mercurius CEO bought 9 million shares yesterday,btohqsg
I got no worry because HSO is debt free,btohqsg
