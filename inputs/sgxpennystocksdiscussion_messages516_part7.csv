Pika World Equity Analysis- 24 August 2021Markets On the FireEquity markets closed highly after last Friday's close. The Nasdaq set a record close after a broad decline last week.The main concern for last week decline was souring sentiments on the global economy. Moreover  the rising infection rates do not help  given that the vaccine efficacy on the new variant is in doubt. Hence  the sell-off.The fear seems to disappear given the vaccine mandate news coupled with a likelihood of longer monetary accommodative measures feeding into the market.The Week AheadPika World expects economic data to dominate the sentiment cycle increasingly. Although we see much of the services activity poor performance was attributed to supply constraints  we might be seeing a real impact on a general decrease in consumption.The buy-the-dip movement appears to have worked well this year and seems to be alive as a strategy thus far. This is partly because market participants may believe that Delta's variant impact on the economy could be temporary. While supply constraints pull back current growth  the expansion in production  hopefully in 2022  which satisfy the backlogs  could help replenish inventories and fuel for the economy.The Fed is Cancelling In-Person Jackson Hole RetreatThere could be far-reaching implications for the latest Fed's move. First  the decision reflects the broader reality of a slow down in economic activity as Covid roars back to the public health crisis. The latest data from TSA showed moderating travel as the number of people passing through the TSA checkpoints falling by 10% on Friday  after reaching a high in mid-July.Next  OpenTable  a restaurant-booker  also see a further decline in reservations. And we have economists from Oxford Economics which has a recovery tracker is stagnant as households become more cautious in their spendingThe Wild Card is Playing OutSince the pandemic begins  Uncle Powell stated that the economy's path is mainly dependent on how the covid delta variant develops. However  during a press conference last Wednesday  he did acknowledge that the subsequent waves of Covid had a reducing impact on the economy. Still  future mutations of the variants are uncertain.The move to a virtual symposium will have an impact on the local economy. Nonetheless  the decision also means that the Fed is generally re-assessing the expected economic health  and hawkish members within the committee may now tilt to a more conservative stance. If that holds  Pika World believes it brings cheers to the market  and the music continues.What's on the Menu Today?At 10 pm  we will receive the New Home Sales for July. We expect an increase to 700K from 676K in the prior month.It is 24 August  Tuesday  8.45 am in Singapore and 8.45 pm in New York. It has been a rising tide in the market  and we hope all friends benefited from the ride!,btohqsg
