hi chris  jus saw your last video  may i know whats the main benefit of topping up ur ma to max at start of the year ? üòÅ,btohqsg
1) Tax relief 2) Any other $ meant for MA now flows to SA instead to earn higher interest than OA (4% I think),btohqsg
For regular salaried workers  the employer‚Äôs contribution will start flowing into your CPF every month. If your MA is at near full BHS  the only opportunity to top up would be at the start of the year.,btohqsg

Anyone knows if Payment through the ntuc app consider online?,btohqsg
but MA will be filled up within few months,btohqsg
The key idea is that using VCMA to fill up your MA has advantages to using salary.1) VCMA contributions are not affected by SA shielding in future  RSTU contributions cannot be shielded.2) If you already hit FRS  you cannot use RSTU to offset taxes. VCMA is your only option.,btohqsg
