my uncle ask if I want a polish chicken as a pet and tbh I’m considering 🤣🤣,btohqsg
Is it going to be part of some emergency food plan,btohqsg
No lah just as a pet lah,btohqsg
I mean if ever run out of food then u know 😂,btohqsg
the thing about polish chickens that makes me not want it is that they’re easily startled  flighty and nervous,btohqsg
but the hens lay an avg of about 2-4 per week and they’re quite light and one of the docile ones among the other chicken breeds,btohqsg
Ohhhh rabbit also. That time had 1 then got thunder then it got heart attack or something,btohqsg
rabbits and hamsters always have a funny way of dying 💀,btohqsg
