Noob question. For moo moo guaranteed 6.8%  after 20 days it would give me the coupons to top up for the differences in yield?,btohqsg
Hi. Can i check  for UOB one card quarterly spending  does it look at calendar month or statement month? (ie. if i spend today and it gets posted tomorrow  does it count for March spending or Feb?),btohqsg
Thanks! So spending today if posted tomorrow counts for spending in march right?,btohqsg
Technically yes  but many of reported that their top up isn’t 6.8%,btohqsg
Probably has to do with day count and slippage.To be fair. Sometimes even bank promo deposit rates won’t be accurate to the last cent. Maybe off by a few dollars.,btohqsg
Not really. If they are topping up the difference those shouldn’t matter. So in actual fact  they should be take the actual 6.8% profits and deduct from the earnings  and give you the coupon if they state they will make up the difference.,btohqsg
Not really. it is the person who manually calculate manually don’t know how to calculate until I told her how to calculate.The formula is simple. Total amount as advertise minus daily interest collected during the period. That shall be the cash coupon amount.,btohqsg
Hi Chris and all  I have subscribed to moo moo plus cash plus before. And they keep accumulating additional interests there today. But I have not signed up for the latest 6.8 % promo yet. Can I sign up for it (as in press start now) on 25th to say put 70K for 40 days then? Or would my 40 days have already started before I clicked on “start now” since I already have existing cash plus?,btohqsg
Depends on your fund level before 1 Feb 2024. Once you registered  Need fresh funds on top of it to qualify.Timer starts once you qualify,btohqsg
What would you say is the best joint account / credit card for paying for household expenses with your significant other  and why?,btohqsg
I have had about 100 sgd from Jan to now and I have not registered yet. Does that mean I can register now and be able to add 70k for 40 days from today? And be qualified for tier 2 bonus,btohqsg
what is your statement date? what are your 3 months to make up the quarter?,btohqsg
Doesnt it follow the calendar quarters? The only quarter that doesnt follow will be the sign up month,btohqsg
Awesome thank you Chris. Moo moo is a bit complicated,btohqsg
Anyone bought from fairprice online with UOB cc? How quickly does it post the transaction?,btohqsg
no. it follows 3 specific statement months that make up your quarter,btohqsg
Any recommended card to pay rental around 2k to 3k?,btohqsg
Usually 3 days if the transaction is done in the day,btohqsg
Hmm… i just checked. In my March statement i received $33 cash back then in July i got $50,btohqsg
If you want to hit $500 spend to get uob one bonus this month  search chat history for tips. U have 1 hour 45 mins left.,btohqsg
u can check your qualifying quarter on the statement,btohqsg
🤣 Seems like many have this issue due to shorter month.,btohqsg
Means for March should deposit $114 900 from 1 March.  Then withdraw all from 28 March correct ?,btohqsg
Just checked. Mine follows calendar quarters. But how does thar affect on how my statements calendar month for my spending?,btohqsg
Am actually looking to switch to evol card. But hoping to clear my last month for this quarter to qualify for quarterly cashback before closing,btohqsg
Hi all  wanted to check with you guys.,btohqsg
Just setup an interactive broker account as I wanted to trade etfBut I recieved an error when setting up the recurring investment structureIs it cos I no deposit any money in  that's why they don't allow me to do recurring investment?,btohqsg
Why would they allow u to do anything since u dont hv any money inside 😂,btohqsg
Haha alright got it. So I need to have money inside first.Cos the error message looks like this,btohqsg
so the best is to topup only on the last day of the period and next day can withdraw?,btohqsg
need to clock $500/$1000/$2000 posted eligible spending and min 5 transactions in each and every of the 3 statement months of your qualifying quarter to get $50/$100/$200 quarterly rebate.,btohqsg
I got my citi rewards card approved and digital card activated. But digital card cannot see the cvv yet. Mentioned have to wait for physical card.I'm trying to use the card for online shopping which needs the cvv. Any ideas how?,btohqsg
Oh yea. I’ve hit for my past 2 months. No issue. I was just wondering if i did some spending today and it only gets posted in march does it count for march or feb spending. So once i hit the $500  i can switch and start using evol and clock $600 this month too,btohqsg
post in Mar statement then count to Mar statement,btohqsg
Yup ok. So for avoidance of doubt… & for benefit of others in future… eg.  this counts as spending for Feb right?,btohqsg
i use chat assist able to change my statement month,btohqsg
Hi  I have not gotten Nov 2023 HSBC EGA Bonus Interest too! It is already 1 Mar!,btohqsg
I’m looking at Stanchart Bonus saver account - for their monthly card spending - is their account card the same as their credit cards like Smart/Simply Cash/Visa Infinite?I’m trying to understand if I use one of the Smart/Simply Cash/Visa Infinite credit cards  will it also be counted under the Bonussaver spending category for interest?,btohqsg
only spending on bonussaver credit/debit card count to card spend bonus interest,btohqsg
i have not gotten it as well. crap,btohqsg
If the interest for SCB Bonus$aver is more than cashback from other cards  then take the account.,btohqsg
When will sc bonus saver acc interest be credited ah,btohqsg
I have been waiting as well.....,btohqsg
