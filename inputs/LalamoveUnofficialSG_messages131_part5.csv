The part where you need to buy groceries. There’s a small section where you have to buy a load amount. Go and accept to see it for yourself. Since now drivers are eligible to cancel at least 2 twice before getting “timed out”.,btohqsg
Those who take the project order remember to count how much you earn compare you snatch order adhoc   you can't believe that project amount is much lesser than adhoc that will increase the price. I seen the 2.4m van project order that came out so low that no one gonna to get it  see for yourself. Which means LLM have cut a big amount for the project order n keep to their pocket. I'm so angry that they keep lower the price that is unfair to drivers who make money for them.,btohqsg
Woi….who parked in the middle of the road?,btohqsg
wah park like that and no ppl there like kinda run TP,btohqsg
That’s what I thot too. And 3 hours later  it was still there. No body seemed bothered by it either. Weird,btohqsg
It’s normal. Almost everytime I pass by this road  I’ll see this van parked there like nobody’s business.,btohqsg
