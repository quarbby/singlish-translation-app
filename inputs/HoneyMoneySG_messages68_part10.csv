But no issues in topping up today right? My concern was cause i emptied my account yesterday on 30 sep (sat) for the promo  and topped up today (sun). Which following business value date may look as if my balance was always 100k. Thoughts on this?,btohqsg
Hi any opinions on using Trust Card? Isit good?,btohqsg
no issue  it will appear as 30 Sep end balance $0 and 2 Oct deposit $100k. Saturday is business day,btohqsg
Just watched the top 6 credit cards for f&b dining. Why was citi rewards+amaze preferred over HSBC revolution? Citi rewards still have to link to amaze for 10x points but hsbc revolution can just use as per normal right? Plus hsbc revolution includes travel as mcc. Any experts can share which is the better card? Thanks!,btohqsg
I see. Thank you good sir. But just as a precaution i took it out again. Will be topping up tomorrow. Appreciate the advice. Good luck on your personal finance journey,btohqsg
Krispay layers on top of google pay or apple pay  this means u earn the miles from your credit card AND from SIA directly.,btohqsg
Normally due to prevent any funny merchant with different category MCC outside of dining,btohqsg
Both cards have same dining mcc. So which is the better one?,btohqsg
pros and cons on both cards.hsbc revolution better points roundinghsbc revolution covers hotel mcc forhotel dining  Amaze+crmc covers most mcc except travel e.g.hotelcrmc can redeem miles with more atrline partners,btohqsg
Adding on HSBC if have EGA would be 1% extra cashback ~I used both,btohqsg
I just useheymax.ai  future potential spend in the month then decide from there...,btohqsg
Things like theater la   cinema la  bullion la usually only CRMC then can fulfil 4mpd,btohqsg
can also use hsbc ega giro pay crmc for 1%  so no diff,btohqsg
SC Esaver account  if $0 in balance  will -$5 fall below fee cause any additional fees like cash advance facility / fees?,btohqsg
Anyone received ega 1% cashback qualify notification for Oct? I have done the 2k deposit and 5 transactions in Sep but didn't receive any sms until now,btohqsg
I also didn‚Äôt receive. I asked the CSO twice and they checked and said I qualify and just to wait for the SMS ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
For integrated shield plan anyone knows which insurer better? As in more worth it in $ terms.,btohqsg
no fall below fees if keep $0,btohqsg
I thought $5 if fall below $1k? Stated on SC website...,btohqsg
if $0 they dun charge  the account dun go negative,btohqsg
Has anyone gotten UOB one account bonus interest yet ?,btohqsg
Last month it was credited on 4th Sep  can take reference.,btohqsg
for me i use amaze card. - to avoid any extra fee charge by bank.and you can choose which card (link) to received the tax refund.if you link wallet - the tax refund will go to your amaze wallet.if you link debit/credit card - it will go to card accordingly with SGD.,btohqsg
Can ask CRMC if apply supp card means points cap is sgd1000 each card or split sgd1000 from main card holder?,btohqsg
Guys  how do I pay my UOB One credit card bill? Why can I pay within the UOB app?,btohqsg
Do you have uob one account? If yes  go to the credit card  you will see pay or transfer button.,btohqsg
Ya I do. Oh so that‚Äôs how you pay. It‚Äôs so confusing. Should say ‚ÄúPay credit card bill‚Äù like how SC does it. Thanks btw üòò,btohqsg
last months i buy apple gift card at jem . it rejected for me on the lease plus point due to is gifts card,btohqsg
total $1000 across main and supp cards,btohqsg
Easy rule is supp card always pool with main card regardless of which credit card or bank,btohqsg
Sorry boss üò±But what exception wor  genuinely didn't know,btohqsg
BOC zaobao card  used to have separate cap and spending requirements for supp card  but later changed to combined,btohqsg
Is this true? Aiya  I have been keeping 1k inside to avoid fall-below fee. So I can draw everything out  leaving $0   without any repercussions?,btohqsg
Maybe collect when u closing account,btohqsg
Using amaze too  the only problematic part is if you pay by linked credit card  any refund made by merchant will not go through and you will need to manually change the amaze default to amaze wallet in order to receive any refund  then transfer the money to other wallet then to your bank account or withdraw it from ATM machine  both with some additional charges.,btohqsg
hmm. my refunds propagated to my credit card,btohqsg
Probably I am the unlucky one then üòÖ,btohqsg
i had no encounter refund before. not sure about that but it should works.or you link to debit card it will go your bank account when the tax refund is initiated? - that will avoid the charges for withdrawal issue.because i just spend the fund in the wallet anyway - this is same case when i redeem point with the SGD 20.00.instead of trying to withdraw out.,btohqsg
Is this a itune gift card? Or gift card than can be used for products?,btohqsg
Hi experts  noob question  but can I check if I can use my miles to redeem a flight for another person?,btohqsg
Hi guys  while travelling  will you guys prefer to use DBS Alititude card for overseas spending to earn miles while paying FCY fees or use Youtrip debit card?,btohqsg
Youtrip and amaze + citi rewards perhaps,btohqsg
Just a note to everyone who's thinking to put money into Mari Invest Apparently they don't pay out any returns for the weekends and public holidays unlike your Fullerton funds in ur Webull / Tiger etc which pays out 1 shot on MondayThis is quite dumb IMO because i'm actually losing 2 days of interest / earnings VS putting it in the Maribank Savings Account,btohqsg
Just transferred funds to moomoo for 5.8%pa  just wanted to get the general understanding which funds did you guys buy into?,btohqsg
No need to do anything. Moomoo will settle automatically,btohqsg
Redeemed SSB and cash should be out today. Does anyone know what time it usually happens? Using DBS,btohqsg
Haha I thought still need to subscribe üòÇ,btohqsg
Does anyone know is the Phillips smart money park interest credit daily or monthly?,btohqsg
Need to subscribe for promotion then deposit funds. After that just wait 1 month,btohqsg
I see  so I'm guessing most of us going into SGD Fullerton?,btohqsg
