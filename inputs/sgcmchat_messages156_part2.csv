bruh i think last i see this car was like grey or smtg idk if itâ€™s the right one tho,btohqsg
hi js asking.. if idk the owner of the car/didnt ask but i post their car on like tt or ig or social media with or without blocking their carplate   is it wrong? (not saying i did but i just wanna know before i do anything that can be badðŸ˜­) sry if its a stupid qnðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
Why do I feel this warmth is a little... to much?,btohqsg
it's best to block but honestly speaking i doubt half the people would care unless you're trespassing,btohqsg
i see people casually posting C&K meets without blurring the plates lol,btohqsg
but if you want to prevent kbws from being anal then yeah  block the plates,btohqsg
else i doubt the general population would give a fuck,btohqsg
The other opinion is that it should be the responsibility of the owner to use a plate cover should they really be concerned about their identity. Car meets have been going around for years and its not new that people come to take photos/videos,btohqsg
it's technically public information. i don't see the fuss,btohqsg
unless of course you have their NRIC and all to view the log cards,btohqsg
Notice carefully and u will see a plate,btohqsg
