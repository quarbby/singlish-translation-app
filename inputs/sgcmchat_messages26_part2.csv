U need dog or not? I can bark for u,btohqsg
btw it wasnt meant to be a discrimination  i was saying team sp because i was js encouraging people to go to the same poly as me thats it. Sorry if it came off as stereotyping or offensive but it was never my intention maam,btohqsg
and yes i know many whom have grad from ite earning 6 figures a month. Mad respect,btohqsg
but im not mad because u said this because i understand u may have felt offended by what i had said,btohqsg
what im mad at was this because which part of the convo involved u bro? and who are u to comment on others appearance if ure so insecure to even put a photo of urself as ur pfp. Please lah  grow up,btohqsg

Im not even tryna square up or anyth with u  im js telling u nicely now to think before u send stuff,btohqsg
u realise im not even insulting u or anyth  im literally js saying it as a decent human being to another,btohqsg
but im not here to lecture u thru some chat. Choose ur own words tbh. im not gonna be ur mom or dad rn. Just learn how to at least have some manners in the things u type if ure unsure of what someone is even saying in the beginning,btohqsg
im not here to pick a fight or anyth. Im literally here to clarify what i said and to apologise if it sounded insulting to anyone but i left to cool down so i could pick my words out.,btohqsg
its not the first time things like this have been said in the chat. tbf its not healthy for anyone here. We literally all joined the chat because we have a similar passion. I dont see any fun in putting anyone down,btohqsg
soSoraim sorry if i was offensive can we put this behind us?,btohqsg
im not those type who want to pick fights and stuff over spilled milk i rather solve something and get on with life asap,btohqsg
