does anyone hav any bullying stories to share?,btohqsg
I got alot cuz I was bullied for 9 years of my life :),btohqsg
But which kind of bullying r u looking for,btohqsg
I was bullied cause of how I looked and how I behaved. I left school to self study. Idk what else is to know,btohqsg
u dun hav to share if u dun want to!!,btohqsg
"Abit long coz is a few incidents that happened to me:I would say bullying for me only happened when I was p4  which is very lucky considering how much shit most other students had to go through. Back then I had to change seats coz my previous seat partner kept stealing my shit. Then this new group I was sitting with was led by this girl who was very nice and friendly to me at first. Even started gaming coz she and her friends all playing: she was on friendly terms with almost everyone in the class.Later on she became very problematic. Our clique eventually had 4 people in total including me  all girls  with the girl mentioned before as the ""leader of the pack"". One of the other girls in the clique was my friend since p3. Mostly I was made fun of coz I was seen as nerdy  goody-two-shoes especially coz I played the piano  do my homework  listen to teacher. Basically I was ""uncool"".The most jialat case was when the leader decided to physically bully me  but the toxic thing was she knew she cannot do it herself in case she got into trouble  so she asked the other 2 girls to do it. I was dumb af also lah I stand there let them kick me coz I want to act tough  should have shoved her stupid face in the wall-- anyway  she kept taunting me to call my older bro to find them for revenge. My p3 friend later apologised to me  frankly she only kicked my shoe and didn't dare defy the leader for fear of being the next target. Very common trope in usual school group bullying casesThe toughest part was when my parents didn't pay much heed. My domestic helper actually questioned me on the bruise on my knee coz she said it looks like it was inflicted on purpose  but I kept insisting I fell down. She told my mum about her suspicions but my mum just briefly asked me what happened  and she believed immediately that I fell down. My family do know that this clique was a problematic bunch but I had no other friends irl so I had to stick around them  don't learn from me keedz just fk care this kind of peopleLater on this leader kept asking us to forge parents letter to pon school  to which I refused coz that meant forging signature as well which is serious shit. From there I got ostracised very very badly  but looking back  the leader was being stupid lah.Subsequently we were split into different classes in p5  this leader kept saying we must be friends foreva!!! And she decided to find me one day  tickle me while I was eating till I puked my food out. I must have looked fking murderous or some shit coz I never seen her running away so fast before. And yea  she avoided me and targeted another girl instead from then.",btohqsg
bruh i throw the paper alr lol,btohqsg
I missed my tuition loan application deadline,btohqsg
did anyone dsa to sajc yet,btohqsg
hello everyonedo yall know if money changers are common in korea  more specifically in seoul?,btohqsg
random qn  but yeah definitely  like any other major city you can find a few  though I would advise changing in Singapore first or using a multi-currency card (then withdrawing from ATMs as needed) to make things easier for you,btohqsg
I heard Jr and Sr papers were good,btohqsg
so im about to send in my report cards+cca records for dsa,btohqsg
but like my teacher printed my leadership position wrongly on my report book😬 do i still send it in but add a note to contact my teacher for the updated leadership position or i dont send it in?,btohqsg
to go jc   do I have to include chinese in my l1r5,btohqsg
But u have to pass chinese,btohqsg
if never pass  totally cannot go jc ah,btohqsg
then can I take clb in JC even if I pass,btohqsg
i think thats on a case by case basis,btohqsg
I got f9 for chinese (not that I’m proud of it) and I’m taking CLB now,btohqsg
Yup clb is way less stressful,btohqsg
so D7 they'll recommend clb   E8 or worse   cannot go jc,btohqsg
is it possible I pass chinese but iw to take clb,btohqsg
You’ll need to negotiate with your school for that,btohqsg
then if my block test results also show that my chi jialat keep failing then is there a chance to drop to clb ?,btohqsg
oh okay  so taking clb is rly dependent on my olvl results otherwise nego with the sch,btohqsg
Yup they will just get you to take CLB if you get D7 or worse,btohqsg
haha that's great then  thx a lot,btohqsg
if so   when the jc curriculum start alr   i js study clb ah,btohqsg
You’ll just need to fulfil the min MTL requirements and get <21 L1R5 to advance to JC unconditionally,btohqsg
So if you really cannot pass O level Chi  I’d suggest that you take both CLB and O levels,btohqsg
my chinese rly vv jialat that's whyy,btohqsg
been failing since sec1 but surprisingly fared okay for the olvl mcq part ah,btohqsg
fared okay = passed mcq haha,btohqsg
ok ba   from there then discuss again,btohqsg
yep but im exco but record says that im sl,btohqsg
With 20 pts u can go YIJC mah,btohqsg
now cop 19 but who knows will go back to 20,btohqsg
I read the conditional admission stuff  basically if I'm not wrong at J1 u need take again then if u still cannot pass then you're kicked out?,btohqsg
so as long i get D7 or more  im safe la hor,btohqsg
does the 'other supporting document' mean certificates for cca? can submit other certs?(eg academic competitions),btohqsg
hello hello any np lads online,btohqsg
do you know if np accepts parents letter for absences,btohqsg

i was tryna find out if i can clear my absence with valid reason in honest ways,btohqsg
but since np doesnt allow parent letters,btohqsg
then ok ill let them take it as i skipped class,btohqsg
i mean i got skip before but uh,btohqsg
this time i rly cannot go,btohqsg
yall got affluenza i got influenza,btohqsg
okay adios i need to study for my quiz,btohqsg
thanks!! hopefully i wont fail again!! and even if i do  hopefully people wont force me to specify my failing grade!!,btohqsg
thanks(?) for picking up on that,btohqsg
ok bye if i say any further i will actually fail (again),btohqsg
im too used to open book,btohqsg
this one only at the end of the module right,btohqsg
mehhh I feel better for closed book,btohqsg
now my quizzes r damn big so i need open book,btohqsg
plus if u actually study u do better than others,btohqsg
i feel terrible when i study but fail,btohqsg
if i dont study at least i can understand partly why i fail,btohqsg
if u never study u wont know if u can fail,btohqsg
u wont know if u can pass as well,btohqsg
YEAH! I have no excuses on why I failed - I put in the effort and I still flopped.,btohqsg
Don't blame others for your own failure,btohqsg
You are the reason of your own downfall,btohqsg
https://youtu.be/GVTs6CwjPnM(YouTube does give me interesting suggestions),btohqsg
How do u guys feel abt this yr s smo,btohqsg
hi!! Just wanted to ask a question abt universities — what are the main differences between NUS and NTU (tho i think it depends on the course i want to do as well😅),btohqsg
Different uni diff kind of culture!!,btohqsg
I think.. NUS also have a strong Enterprise culture for those looking to go to the start up route.,btohqsg
is all abt who u know,btohqsg
to me the only tangible difference is hall policy,btohqsg
u from ntu and u gd u can also make stonks in the startup world,btohqsg
u go sit sutd also if u say liddat,btohqsg
My program let me work oversea also ahahahah and i not frm nus,btohqsg
Does the other universities organize such events? idk,btohqsg
Maybe nus got higher % involved,btohqsg
Then it's up to ppl to prioritize wat they want,btohqsg
don't go uni also can go overseas work,btohqsg
nus is ahead of ntu on this,btohqsg
You are not wrong. I know someone in Private U also can land a job at Lazada.,btohqsg
Is how you wanna sell yourself.,btohqsg
ntu ranking doesn't mean shit lol even smu better than ntu,btohqsg
I dun see the difference for ppl who wanna stay within the sg sphere at all,btohqsg
Such as ntu accountancy being shorter so can work earlier,btohqsg
hci and raffles same calibre no point comparing also,btohqsg
And ntu biz being shorter so internship more rush,btohqsg
Too bad I am in Biz so I won’t have SUTD as an option even though that ‘s the nearest to my house.,btohqsg
More legit basis of judgement than oo ranking oo exclusive program,btohqsg
majority of biz graduates go work as what?,btohqsg
i’m thinking of doing social sciences so was just thinking of nus or ntu would suit me better,btohqsg
I think nus is just that much more wrll known for socsci,btohqsg
Banking ones may end up in Banking.,btohqsg
oh so the mean salary reported in GES is heavily pulled up by those in IB?,btohqsg

im doing ib and graduating next yr so currently weighing out my options if i wanna go back sg unis,btohqsg

I got into oversea but then realized no money,btohqsg

He attended the orientation camp and the next thing he did was to quit and go to London.,btohqsg

UK is v preprofessional I heard 👀👀,btohqsg
But then again sg also a bit like that,btohqsg
tuition cost ex 😭😭 tho sg living cost also ex,btohqsg
Yeah the cost is the big factor,btohqsg
did u know that tyen rasif has biceps?,btohqsg
The unis I got into were like,btohqsg
420k low end 550k high end,btohqsg
I think i can also consider australia too,btohqsg
but idk no money for tuition cost HAHAH,btohqsg
Try for sg uni unbonded scholarships,btohqsg
thats oso why i wanna go back,btohqsg
Aus shld have but only small amounts,btohqsg
IDP has a lot of those.,btohqsg
Canada has LBP but I think only 1 person per sch can be nominated for it,btohqsg
Is it possible to factor a good university in terms of their acceptance rates?,btohqsg
Any EEE folks wanna be friends?,btohqsg
I also gym  gymbros welcome too,btohqsg
