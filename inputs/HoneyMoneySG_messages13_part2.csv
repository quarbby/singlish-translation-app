As compared to uob evol and DBs live need to meet the 3 category of min $600,btohqsg
Can UOB Preferred Platinum worm with Kris+?,btohqsg
hmm.. no ah  does it count as mobile contactless? coz if it does  then no need to see MCC,btohqsg
Ppv has a white list for online spending,btohqsg
hmm.. I don't think it's considered as online spend,btohqsg
my citi rewards did not get it,btohqsg
it is online mobile in-app. Citi rewards exclude this. Uob ppv treat it as online  and only get 4mpd for whitelist of mcc.,btohqsg
So need to use HSBC revolution or DBS WW MC?,btohqsg
yes  so effective rebate less than 3.33%,btohqsg
yes. hsbc revolution also need to be under whitelist of MCC  bigger list than PPV's though.,btohqsg
Hsbc Revo I think it's 2.4 or 2.5% Cashback am I right,btohqsg
uob evol and dbs live fresh need to meet $600 min spend  with cap on mobile contactless/ contactless rebate and separate cap on online rebate. For dbs live fresh can get full 5% so long spend min $600  within the caps for contactless/online rebate; can easily make up the min spend by topping up prepaid cards for example though no 5%. Uob evol ideally need $250 online+$250 mobile contactless+$100 others to max out the rebate; can also spend more on online/mobile contactless to make up the $100 though effective rebate will be lower.,btohqsg
10x points=2.5% for online/contactless on the whitelist of mcc.,btohqsg
Ya both alao need to meet the $600 specific catagory $250 each then can get the Cashback but I guessed uob one more all rounder just need to meet the $500 min,btohqsg
Don't always spend online $250 the the contactless still ok,btohqsg
Good morning  any comments/view about gearing / leveraging?,btohqsg

Hi  may I know what is a good UOB credit card to get in regards to the UOB savings account ?,btohqsg
Uob one card with one account I suppose,btohqsg
uob evol  uob lady  uob one all quite good depending on your spending pattern,btohqsg
if i spend more on contactless  and simply go - uob one should be better or hsbc revo?example ntuc cold storage retails like challenger nike appleshopee lazada amazon depend maybe $100 at least per monthholiday trip not for nowf&B with QR code for now i use  grab since after oct 14 stil can use but nerfgrab after 14 oct i still can use for utilty bill like SP genenco and mobile fibre bills since most card dont support utilityuob one i recall got some support on SP for utility,btohqsg

Iâ€™m new to citi bank  whatâ€™s the best way to maximise? I want to sign up for citi plus too,btohqsg
HSBC revo doesn't reward for simply go  for your use case  UOB One does look better,btohqsg

UOB One has 1% on top of 3.33% for utilities... 10% for Shopee... 10% for simply GO... so your overall % will be higher based on your spending style,btohqsg
if not split into a few cards... Citi Cashback for 8% on grocery + miscellaneous since min spend $800,btohqsg
then UOB one for the other $500/mo,btohqsg
Citi Cashback+ or the Citi Cashback card?,btohqsg
Ok will look into the Citi Cashback card thx,btohqsg
For the uob one when is a best time to sign up likeend of the month? So can chalk up 3 month as I noticed it's every quarterLike now already Oct so I got 2 month More to chalk up the Total sum? Or it best I sign up end of December so can tap on Jan to march 2023 ?,btohqsg
Which card is good to pay for travel agency like Chang brothers or CTC?,btohqsg
first sign up is prorated... meaning if u spend 2mo of the Q they will credit 2/3 of the cashback,btohqsg
