Like i said at the beginning  know whats legal and within your rights and just be polite  whether you are the car owner or the dude taking the pic. Then all problems are avoided and everyone is happy,btohqsg
as i said just now  the best solution  is to avoid it to begin with,btohqsg
it's not about whether it's legal or not  it's about how it is perceived by everyone,btohqsg
Just do bear in mind everything you said is also just your own viewpoint,btohqsg
just because it's legal to fuck a prostitute doesn't mean everyone wants to,btohqsg
Dont pass your opinion off as speaking for everyone. I definitely wont,btohqsg
