and since its inception  it has not expanded,btohqsg
- my friend who take H2 econs from o lvl econs,btohqsg
yes coz the o level econs right  not much analysis needed  like it is more of regurgitating the content,btohqsg
So concept taught in O level econs is somewhat transferable to H2 econs?,btohqsg
Meanwhile I consider o lvl geog borderline useless,btohqsg
there is overlap but expanded much more,btohqsg
for essay  each qns split into 2 4 6 8m and it is mainly content,btohqsg
o level econs got mcq lol,btohqsg
so not easy to score as well under time constraints,btohqsg
my class alr got 3 people took o lvl econs,btohqsg
i dunno coincidence or what coz i know o lvl econs is rare,btohqsg
maybe temasek sec has a big econs cohort  idk,btohqsg
“Economics at TMS is also one of the most sought-after subjects at Upper Secondary level”,btohqsg
interesting  on the flip side my school's econs cohort is 18-2(drop) = 16,btohqsg
nowadays resources are so abundant that even if you need to spend more time figuring out alternative ways to learn (when the teachers are shit)  it's very doable. by the time uni comes  it's straight up not enough to just rely on lecturers and their notes if they want a complete understanding,btohqsg
even in jc it's not enough  but you just had to know how to score for the exam,btohqsg
absolutely true  i think i asked my friend more chem and math questions than i ask my tutors,btohqsg
and even now there are more resources  agreed,btohqsg
but it just takes greater amount of effort ah,btohqsg
than having a readily accessible good tutor,btohqsg
good lecturers in uni is absolutely rare (maybe moe should create nie training for uni lecturers lmao),btohqsg
i think ur investment part is wrong,btohqsg
i heard is because many lecturers are there to do research so their focus not to teach,btohqsg
WHY IS MY KEYBOARD TYPING NOOOOOO ALL OF A SUDDEN,btohqsg
yes  teaching is part of their job but typically not why they apply for it,btohqsg
it's bc unis can provide a ton of funding for their research,btohqsg
but there exists positions that are more teaching focused,btohqsg
it is change in inventories right,btohqsg
meanwhile from ay 24/25  nus will stop reimbursing dyom course certifications,btohqsg
yes. you are keeping 60 pairs of rubber soles that are neither used or sold,btohqsg
oh i got it  idk what i was doing previously lmao,btohqsg
i actually wonder who will be willing to pay $200+ for DYOM certification coz my WTP = $0,btohqsg
the benefit is just free CSCU and otot (but nus modules are embedded in ur school fees liao),btohqsg
it is free but to get the certificate  it is $200+,btohqsg
u need the official verified certification,btohqsg
they didnt explain their rationale behind scraping the reimbursement,btohqsg
but i mean can guess guess ah haha,btohqsg
ite is full of retarded ppl,btohqsg
wld u like to also explain y is there a fking 39 y/o inside,btohqsg
I thought ite is for life long learning,btohqsg
no this person oso make alot of weird comments. i had to delete that,btohqsg
i texted him to stop it alr,btohqsg
i texted him to ask him to stop hitting on minors,btohqsg
im to lazy to dig the chat,btohqsg
i was looking through the chat,btohqsg
and trying to direct the attention towards u instead,btohqsg
js uk tryna ask to stop',btohqsg
I actually didnt do anything. Lmao,btohqsg
Hes just behaving like a twat. No idea what hes tryna achieve,btohqsg
I wasnt even talking to him.,btohqsg
