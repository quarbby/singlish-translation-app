There's ÈªëÈæôÊ±üand Êñ∞ÁñÜ that shares a border. Not sure if any others Main border checkpoint should be Êª°Ê¥≤Èáå,btohqsg
No  they live there and after wars and border disputes they find themselves on the chinese side,btohqsg
There are also a lot of manchus  they are the ones that ruled china during the qing dynasty,btohqsg
People in northern china tend to be much taller,btohqsg
Examples of northern china is what?,btohqsg
Wuhan should be on the yangtse,btohqsg
Maybe  maybe not. Although shanghai is culturally more south,btohqsg
Because ÂÆÅÊ≥¢ËØù influenced shanghainese so much,btohqsg
Shanghai n beijing whats the difference in their culture?,btohqsg
R they the most developed n modern city?,btohqsg
By the way  Âåó‰∫¨ËØù is not standard mandarin,btohqsg
Let me show you a photograph from 2002,btohqsg
This is the shanghai when I was young,btohqsg
Omg this is too nice!!!! Is los angeles like this too??,btohqsg
Rise of the internet. At the time  people don't really use the internet. And many people here aren't born yet,btohqsg

Look at the way people used to dress. A much more simpler way of life,btohqsg
Hahaha. I meant the style of clothing. More dull and less of today's fashion,btohqsg
Fashion is about your favourite of the many school shirts in your wardrobe,btohqsg
Oh yes remind me of my parentsOmg so nostalgic!!!!! I cant believe it. It was how my parents dressed!!,btohqsg
Times r moving forward sooooo fast,btohqsg
Singapore restricted passport for west Malaysia,btohqsg
Okay so shanghai is the modern city of china,btohqsg
The most modern in mainland china in my opinion,btohqsg
How about other parts of china  are hey seemingly backward nowadays?,btohqsg
Nice. I asked around before yes it is,btohqsg
Depends where. Shenzhen is super modern  but a new city. So I dislike it.Guangzhou is good. The food is good.Beijing is okay  historical. Peking duck is nice.Of course you will find a more backwards part of any country. Look at Kranji and Lim chu kang in Singapore. Look at Pulau ubin. But I like the nostalgia,btohqsg
Took an ATR-72 from KL subang to Singapore seletar this year. Suprised that many don't know about seletar airport,btohqsg
XSP is the IATA code for Seletar,btohqsg
Ya i heard of it but dunno much about it,btohqsg
U mean we can just go travel via seletar airport????,btohqsg
Yes. There is a new terminal building. Very tiny  only one luggage belt,btohqsg
Anyway just wanted to clarify hows the hygiene standard n standard of living in china?,btohqsg
If they don't maintain it well  it is dirty. But can be super clean as well if they maintain it. But I'm used to it. Might be a shock for some Singaporeans.,btohqsg
But in 2001 it was way less hygenic,btohqsg
Ya in 2007 my jc friends went shandong,btohqsg
Last time  when you enter the lift in winter  there is a smell.,btohqsg

But I like the old days,btohqsg
Ya i have a friend from shanghai,btohqsg

Find a tour agency and apply for a visa,btohqsg
I want to play üèÄ with kim,btohqsg

Yes and I have to go to the counter and withdraw or deposit. I doubt the ATM can do it. Never tried though,btohqsg
Always at the cashier in the bank,btohqsg
I cant afford to visit bank daily man,btohqsg
I rarely visit. I am not working.,btohqsg
If I showed you my passport just now  why do you think I am an expatriate,btohqsg
Hmmm then u r on long term visit pass?,btohqsg

Food okay  not the highlight. Highlight is the scenery,btohqsg
I have better food photographs from other places,btohqsg
Hahaha thats where we differ  cos i dun really pay attn to scenery,btohqsg
I travel for nightlife and food,btohqsg
I also really care about food,btohqsg
Not after I tell you this:They serve everything they have. Flies all around. If you don't eat it they will take it back to give it to another customer,btohqsg
It's common in Indonesia from my understanding,btohqsg
Too exotic. I pass it on hahaha,btohqsg
I know. I wanted to leave...,btohqsg
Is it same as the one in sg,btohqsg
Never tried it in Singapore  so I am not sure. I presume it would be different,btohqsg

Because people are interested so I share,btohqsg
It's in east malaysia  not in singapore,btohqsg

Hehe ya have friends from there,btohqsg

Oh nice so sg developers get to earn?,btohqsg
Is it a good idea if she does?,btohqsg
I don't know what you mean by earn but I have no idea why a singapore developer would put a merlion and suntec city there,btohqsg
Lol if the developer help them and get to earn  i can understand,btohqsg
i think 9 dollar smt  v nice but not worth the money,btohqsg
Ouch. Okay yes enjoyed is the point,btohqsg
I eat fruits and veggie everyday,btohqsg

Ya imma cook it soonBut must wash first,btohqsg
I just went on day trips to these places,btohqsg
Yes  because the pandemic was starting to unfold,btohqsg
It's ok  u can tell me the grade in atomic number,btohqsg

I tot u meant bedok place,btohqsg
Congrats bedok!!! For ya chinese grade,btohqsg
Omg... father tried to catch her,btohqsg
Is Fuzzy pillow a uni teacher?,btohqsg
Hey does anyone have any jc physics planning exercises that I can reference?,btohqsg
wait we can play quizarium here??,btohqsg
holy shit i didn't even realise that person replied to a message from 2 years ago,btohqsg
u got my hopes up üò≠,btohqsg
I suspect he‚Äôs at least a secondary school teacher,btohqsg
i dont think he's an MOE teacher,btohqsg
the way certain answers are given are a bit... unconventional,btohqsg
Either way I think he‚Äôs a professional teacher,btohqsg
Can u imagine if the father didn‚Äôt try to catch her though,btohqsg
He would feel bad for the rest of his life,btohqsg
U don't need to be with MOE to be a teacher,btohqsg
but there's rly a difference between MOE trained and full time tutors,btohqsg
he's one of the more op ones amongst the full time tutors,btohqsg
unlike some others *ahem cough cough*,btohqsg
Yeah he‚Äôs one of the humble ones too haha,btohqsg
Quote of the day for all!,btohqsg
John trying to stay below legal age haha,btohqsg
i woke up at 4  stop complaining,btohqsg
No one forced u tho üòÇ,btohqsg
is a degree actually really necessary?,btohqsg
everywhere i go ppl tell me i need i need a degree,btohqsg
i tell them i cannot afford and they say u have to get it,btohqsg
What do you want to do in the future?,btohqsg
no one is supportive of me not wanting a degree,btohqsg
prob work for my parents biz / start my own biz,btohqsg
thats why i think not necessary,btohqsg
And what if the business collapses?,btohqsg
like  when i say i planning to not get a degree or later  literally 9/10 ppl keep lecturing me on how impt a degree is,btohqsg
Would you be willing to work for someone,btohqsg
but they dont get the idea that i cannot afford a degree,btohqsg
And if so  what would you want to work as?,btohqsg
Many businesses fail. It is normal,btohqsg
no idea but one things for sure,btohqsg
i cannot financially afford a degree,btohqsg
What about academically? Do you think you can cope with university?,btohqsg
You can get scholorships or bursaries.,btohqsg
sorry for the arrogance but studying is not a problem,btohqsg
no i cant  i graduating alr,btohqsg
U can apply for study loan. Most undergrads also do that.,btohqsg
You can then pay off the loan once you start working.,btohqsg
I mean  is either that or parents sponsor/co-pay.,btohqsg
Are you doing A levels or polytechnic now?,btohqsg
my parents 100% do not want me to go uni,btohqsg
so if i take up loan and need their permission they wont let me,btohqsg
If you are doing A levels then it might be harder to find a job,btohqsg
i alr argue w them like 100 times over it,btohqsg
In the event you have to work for someone,btohqsg
If you can run the company and everything's fine  well and good. May not be so worthwhile,btohqsg
But is there any university course you are interested in?,btohqsg
Do you see yourself ready to work now?,btohqsg
im also wondering  if i work for my parents / start my own biz and it fails,btohqsg
It may be a plus point. I heard some companies like people who run a business and failed.,btohqsg
well yeah pretty much  either that or gap year,btohqsg
As long as you have the money later to do a degree if need be  then you could put things on hold and run the business. If it fails then perhaps do a degree in the future. Just set aside money for it,btohqsg
yeah i think thats a good idea,btohqsg
but ppl keep discouraging me thats why i asked,btohqsg
but i guess i got my answer,btohqsg
they keep saying that without a degree u cannot do anything at all,btohqsg
anywhere i go i get lectured,btohqsg
by friends  by people who've been in the industry for damn long,btohqsg
Take the example of entrepreneur Khoo Kar Kiat. At 33 years old ¬†Kar Kiat quit his job to launch Fastbee¬†‚Äì a hawker food delivery service using vending machines as distribution points. This meant learning how to sustain funding and implement tech to improve business models. While the venture failed  Kar Kiat picked up valuable skills which later translated into new employment as Head of Venture at SATS Ltd.,btohqsg
Not true. People hire polytechnic and ITE graduates. It's just in what occupation you are looking for,btohqsg
ya thats why i feel no offence they're too stiff,btohqsg
dont like it when they impose their lives on me,btohqsg
plus i think i moving abroad in 3 years or so,btohqsg
No need. But very good to have one. Is like expeditation to go higher up,btohqsg
To where? I may be familar with this,btohqsg
They r just setting the bar high to push ur boundary,btohqsg
haha to a non-english speaking place,btohqsg
Cos ure still young and can still afford working towards it while u dun have many commitments now,btohqsg
But degree is a good backupLike covid strike and so many biz have to wind down. Then wheres the alternative plans?,btohqsg
Yes lah can get later lahz,btohqsg
but i dont think its for me  not now,btohqsg
Then stop talking to them. They bull üòÇ,btohqsg
Then get later. Go work first,btohqsg
If u work first and wait till 40  suss can give u grant üòÇ sch fees will only be 10k by then,btohqsg
Suss can apply for scholarship/sponsorship too. U just pay for first sem  do well  then go n apply. Sponsorship not difficult to get but u must do some rapport building - a senior shared w me,btohqsg
Forget it dun argue. Our parents are always woodblock cos generational gap. It is natural for them to be less intelligent than newer generation. Just find ur way,btohqsg
Usually you need to set up a business and register it  and then qualify for some investor or working (self-employed by registered company) or business visa or residence permit to live there. As long as your business is registered should not be a big issue.Make sure you have all the paperwork in order for your business. Many people hire agents to sort out the paperwork. In some developing countries (not saying you will go there) the bureaucracy can be terrible. In some cases there is corruption.,btohqsg
No lah. Wont. Employers just want assurance that u know what u want and that u wont ‰∏âÂàÜÈíüÁÉ≠Â∫¶. Cos employers r always looking for ppl who will STAY and GROW with them,btohqsg
@espressobitchyes cos it shows u hv gone thru that experience.,btohqsg
Dunntalk to ppl la. Noisy world  they also dunno ur path. Nobody can give u best advice.,btohqsg
So long as u set ur goals just go and achieve it no need to consult ppl.,btohqsg
ironically ur giving good advice lol,btohqsg
Ya thats why dun talk about it to ppl. Thats usually what u will get when u share ur goals with ppl. Is normal.,btohqsg
Where u wanna do ur finance/econs??,btohqsg
HAHAHAH i was half trolling   there r better options than suss,btohqsg
Thkq cos i was u too.. gone thru exact same situation n feel,btohqsg
oh yea totally forget about ut,btohqsg
Hello! We are TaCo Sg (Taster Course SG)  an organisation that curates taster courses for students across Singapore.Taster Courses include mock lectures  seminars tutorial sessions etc on undergrad degrees which will be delivered through short sessions. These taster courses are particularly for students who have not chosen their Uni degree  and looking at exposing themselves to the different degrees available.TaCo üåÆ SG has provided approximately 100 students with 3 different taster courses at the pilot stage.We are currently looking to recruit seniorsüë©‚Äçüíºüßë‚Äçüíºwho are passionate about teaching and want to help juniors  by giving 1.5-2h taster courses on their degrees.  Before the actual launch during the Uni App season  there will pilot sessions that will be organised fromAug 2020 to October 2020.Before you indicate your interest to be TaCo teacher  please read this rough outline ofwhy you should join our team and expectations of a TaCo teacher:)Link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ja_9bDYI9Bqba8OwJHuiajEqwO_8fXxxPYAcKFHmE9k/edit?usp=sharingIf you are interested in giving taster courses to aid juniors to better make their Uni course decisions  please sign up here at:https://forms.gle/xeMz3aF1CvjxjFcm8We greatly appreciate all the help in making this project a success. If you are a current undergrad student who faced similar problems making your Uni decisions  please consider helping out in this project to help future batches of juniors.Do help us spread the word as well if you know anyone who would be interested in this project ü§©‚ú®Feel free to contact us@wynnelee/@megantwton Telegram ortastercoursesg@gmail.comvia email if you have any questions on the project  thank you so much :DSign ups close on 30 August 2020 2359 :D,btohqsg
they only have pure geog there  wld it be similar to elec geog?,btohqsg
Just pure geog more extra info lo,btohqsg
pure geog and elec geog learn the same things just that pure geog has more,btohqsg
for elec geog what is not tested for o levels?,btohqsg
Elect Geog is no coasts  no weather KQ3  no food KQ2/3  no health and diseaseNo coasts GI  is replaced by Weather GI which is something pure geog don‚Äôt learn,btohqsg
as in o level topics or you saying pure geog vs elec geog,btohqsg
Elective geog is human geog ya,btohqsg
And all the chapters inside elective geog textbook will be tested,btohqsg
There will be a textbook for elective geog,btohqsg
Pure geog learn physical geog and human geog too.Elective geog only focus on human geog,btohqsg
elect geog is w&c  food  tourism and plate tech,btohqsg
pure geog is just the chps in elect geog + health & diseases + food,btohqsg
Anyway go search for syllabus guide,btohqsg
It will list out o level chapters,btohqsg
Omg why i dun recall learning about food in elective geog,btohqsg
Does anyone have tips to study for chem prac,btohqsg
If no time  fake titration resultsProb wont test for sulfur dioxide so no point testing for that I hope,btohqsg
no ??? elective geog has physical geog too,btohqsg
i dont suffer in plate tech for nothing,btohqsg
Oh maybe just touch the surface only but not heavy content,btohqsg
If is combined chem then it is purely memorizing. Dun have any secrets üòÖ,btohqsg
Planning leh. Any like pre exam tips?,btohqsg
Huh. Ohnsorry maybe whatever i remberrd don apply anymore üòÖ,btohqsg
Last time whatever i memorized helped me expand my range of correct terms to use  in describing  but nvm maybe it is an outdated approach,btohqsg
Uh. I cant think of any. You just need to know the reactions  but I guess the format of the steps are quite standard,btohqsg
Must have gotten mixed up in the convo,btohqsg
Then u will automatically see the obvious ans in every question,btohqsg
Surveys and the like can be shared on discord,btohqsg
Anyth as long as it helps,btohqsg
QA just Google the a levels data booklet and remember all the stuff in the qa portion,btohqsg
any tips for remembering glycolysis process and Krebs cycle üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠,btohqsg
Hmm.. if there‚Äôs colour change.. purple solution add to colourless solution  purple colour will fade,btohqsg
Either see effervescence or brown ppt,btohqsg
Ah yes!Well it‚Äôs Kel hereis chem expert  take it from him!!,btohqsg
What if let's say ur reacting copper with hydrochloric acid. Copper is unreactive so,btohqsg
Potassium manganate with potassium iodide or H2O2,btohqsg
Oh yea i know common oxidising agent is potassium manganate while reducing agent is potassium iodide,btohqsg
Cool beans that extra buttons bot,btohqsg
Chemistry Practical NotesAll the Best for your Chemistry Practicalhttps://t.me/InorganicQA,btohqsg
You can upload it toexams.sgif you‚Äôd like,btohqsg
cuz i cannot remember the 'cycles' for my biochemistry exammmm üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ and the stupid amino acid structurws shHHehzuHHhsjsjshsuwhdisjs i want to Head --> Wall,btohqsg
There's YouTube video about amino acid structure also,btohqsg
ooo okay ty! is it on youtube or smth?,btohqsg
There are more   u see which one u need,btohqsg
Ok post here when you complete 1 set,btohqsg
Tell you what. For colour of ppt in cation tests:Draw a tree and 4 clouds.Write ‚ÄúFe3+‚Äù on the tree trunk because it‚Äôs reddish-brownWrite ‚ÄúFe2+‚Äù on the canopy of leaves because they are greenWrite ‚ÄúAl3+‚Äù  ‚ÄúPb2+‚Äù  ‚ÄúZn2+‚Äù and ‚ÄúCa2+‚Äù in the 4 clouds because they are whiteWrite ‚ÄúCu2+‚Äù on the sky because it‚Äôs blueüòä,btohqsg
I'm memorising the effects on heating.( Colour)Copper oxide is blackLead oxide is blackZinc is white when cold yellow when hot,btohqsg
Still trying to get it all  and I still have heating of carbonatesüò¢,btohqsg
Zinc oxide.. if you see solid turns yellow when hot  it‚Äôs zinc oxide in your syllabus,btohqsg
But I more or less memorised the cation anion and test for gas,btohqsg
All decompose except K2CO3 and Na2CO3,btohqsg
But for AgCO3  decomposition to Ag instead of Ag2O yeah,btohqsg
Acidify to remove any carbonates present  because most carbonates are insoluble in water and may lead to misleading results if present,btohqsg
Is that why add nitric acid first?,btohqsg
Add nitric acid because nitrates are soluble in water,btohqsg
So anion tests are just precipitation reactions,btohqsg
2 salt solutions give an insoluble salt and a by-product salt,btohqsg
So your by-product salt is nitrate.. which won‚Äôt form ppt to mislead the results,btohqsg
But still great stuff I'll wake up 4.30 tmmrw to mug that,btohqsg
Paiseh I probably trying memo in never touch phone,btohqsg
curious whats singapore's sentiment on transgendered people,btohqsg

And i havent studied anything too,btohqsg
then ur not rejected what ???,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think that word means what you think it means,btohqsg
is poa paper 1 mostly about theory?,btohqsg
the ceiling is something ill nvr reach cos im short,btohqsg
throw u up to the ceiling u want?,btohqsg
Any advice to at least pass e math and a math,btohqsg
If not im probably retaking it next year alr,btohqsg
Hehe ya just practiseActually if u hate it u will just hate it,btohqsg
Why not do it slower but with higher accuracy,btohqsg
Hmm practise... for me  clear the questions on topics like algebraic manipulation  stats  HCF  LCM fast,btohqsg
You need more time for trigo  geometry,btohqsg
That‚Äôs E-math.. the last question which weighs 7-10 marks.. try your best to show working steps.. they are quite tedious.. so Ensure you have enough time for it.. don‚Äôt spend too much time thinking because you need time to check through,btohqsg
A-math.. allocate more time for questions on coordinate geometry  trigo  linear law when plotting of graphs is needed.. questions on rate of change or minima/maxima need knowledge on mensuration in E-math  so usually the first part of the question involves showing the result. If you can‚Äôt  don‚Äôt spend too much time trying. Use the result to continue the other parts,btohqsg
