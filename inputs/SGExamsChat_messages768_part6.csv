i‚Äôm just afraid he grows up and does this to others,btohqsg
Society will teach him it's alright,btohqsg
I love kengijg and I want to stretch myself. I want to expand my keng ability and play bastard with my superiors so I can make my life easier and better. And most of all  I want to use my mc to simply go out or sleep at home to enjoy my ns benefits and to inspire other ckws to ck.Being a ckw is still shunned upon by many so I want to shine that light and let other ckws know that ck is okay.,btohqsg
Just ask for 5 day MC,btohqsg
u shld break it next time/s,btohqsg
Kinds feel sad for you sia  your life+ men not going well at all first your love then now your bro haiz,btohqsg
i think my mom will kill me,btohqsg
I just use public transport as much as possible,btohqsg
i just concerned over the bruise,btohqsg
cos i never seen so dark red before,btohqsg
previously it was blue then yellow,btohqsg
Ya can understand. When your brother annoys you it‚Äôs ok  but when you retaliate he plays victim and tries to curry sympathy,btohqsg
Reminds me of that Arthur‚Äôs fist scene lol,btohqsg
Sometimes you gotta vent it all out and throw one big punch,btohqsg
WHO TAUGHT HIM TO BE SUCH A PROFESSIONAL GASLIGHTER,btohqsg
I still can't believe the wrong no. assalamualaikum me,btohqsg
i still wonder who tf is it,btohqsg
wait am i rude to ask this?,btohqsg
Nah bruh thought he would think I'm a scam caller üòÇ,btohqsg
and u rso how many times,btohqsg
No worries  any day. Hope your blue black heals in days,btohqsg
The whole point of kenging is to get me leisure/rest time,btohqsg
You have to create your own valuation of that,btohqsg
oh not camp to clinic ah,btohqsg
If let‚Äôs say one extra day of leisure is worth $20 for me  but the cost is forfeiting $8 of meal allowance  I‚Äôll take the MC lol,btohqsg
then go doctor lose like $50,btohqsg
But the marginal benefit of kenging each additional day would get less and after a certain point there‚Äôs marginal costs such as forfeiting my promotion and hence potential allowance,btohqsg
How do you not know govt healthcare is free for NSFs,btohqsg
hence msc shifts towards the left,btohqsg
It doesn‚Äôt shift. It‚Äôs just that the gradient is not constant or 0,btohqsg
Since I‚Äôm so boliao maybe I should come up with a cost benefit graph for each additional day of kenging,btohqsg
Mana Doctor is like $10-$20 and you can claim back. Don't even need go polyclinic,btohqsg
Sleep play phone and if you‚Äôre adventurous go out and hope you don‚Äôt get caught,btohqsg
And if you retaking As more time to study,btohqsg
Oh ya under $20 can claim full cost,btohqsg
wait can retake As while going ns?,btohqsg
It rly depends on what vocation,btohqsg
At least don‚Äôt have to wake up early,btohqsg
I‚Äôm also a light sleeper so can‚Äôt sleep in the office,btohqsg
At home it‚Äôs much more comfortable,btohqsg
I thought his results are decent,btohqsg
Anyway I‚Äôve sort of planned when and how to take mc so that I don‚Äôt hit 30 days or affect my promotion,btohqsg
The c & k in clerks stands for chao keng,btohqsg
