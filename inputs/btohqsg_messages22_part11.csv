Hi anyone have idea about OBF will be launch in this year ü•π,btohqsg
Unlikely in my opinion  considering the tighter rule of non selection. Most applicants now are more careful when applying for bto or sbf unlike b4 the rule implemented. Thus  lesser units non selected  which means unlikely theres OBF. Just my thought  i maybe wrong.,btohqsg
And SBF sales is once a yr now  the units sold like hotcake.,btohqsg
im looking for SBF too.. :(( but dont know which to believe when to hdb  they say have to wait for june and wasnt satisfied and so i sent e feedback and this is what they sent,btohqsg
If the upcoming BTO can complete likely 2 years time  how good  right?,btohqsg
Bto - feb  june  octSbf - feb,btohqsg
Wonder ü§î if hfe letters expire on 23 June I wonder if I got time to apply for the June bto,btohqsg
Or need to redo the hfe again,btohqsg
If mine hfe letters not expire yet can I reapply?,btohqsg
HFE reapply one month before expiry,btohqsg
Your HFE only valid if the June BTO application start on or before 23 June,btohqsg
To be safe better to reapply and renew ur hfe,btohqsg
The launch might be 30th june. If before 23rd then ur safe,btohqsg
You can cancel and reapply HFEBestCall hdb and ask firstAsk for any issues if you were to cancel and reapply HFE,btohqsg
Now a days HDB rules change to fast,btohqsg

They have to sign the undertaking of MCPS which is in your application form.They don‚Äôt need to be there physically as the HDB officer will video call them using your phone. Please ask them to standby with their NRIC during your selection period.,btohqsg
okay noted on that i think i found where they need to sign  also the document mentioned we need to bring birth cert and marriage cert did u experience this also?,btohqsg
Ya just bring. They need proof of child parent relationship as well as marriage of parents. If got any divorce judgement also bring that,btohqsg
okay thanks  so all in all they need to sign the application form  i need to prepare ic  birth cert and my parents marriage cert and ask them to standby with their ic‚Äôs for a video call during the time of my flat selection correct?,btohqsg

hey guys  my hfe expires in july  can i not resubmit a hfe application if i want to participate in the june bto?,btohqsg
When did you apply for your hfe?,btohqsg
HDB willextend the validity of all existing and new HFE letters to 9 months  from the current 6 monthsThis extension of the validity period of HFE letters will take effect from 7 November 2023.,btohqsg
