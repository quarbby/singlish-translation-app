For the record  I don't qualify as boomer. I'm middle Gen Xer,btohqsg
Me cars all stock as can be. Even rims are stock,btohqsg
If you get one that's well taken care of  it's a breeze. Almost like any conti car. Even better if you know where to get parts from online. Local stockists will ketok you big time,btohqsg
Considering a caymen for sometime Liao,btohqsg
And getting part numbers are a breeze cause Porsche publishes the parts list for all the cars for public use,btohqsg
I'd recommend the 987.2 if you're looking at that generation,btohqsg
PDK  Cable linked hand brake and most importantly  hydraulic power assisted steering. None of that electric steering crap,btohqsg
I do a fair bit of DIY maintenance and part replacement in my driveway so it saves cost as well. I also enjoy taking apart and fixing stuff.,btohqsg
Gonna test drive your car when I see you,btohqsg
Haha can. But closed circuit or carpark only cause insurance only covers named drivers,btohqsg
My car may not be the best example. Cause it was heavily abused before I bought it. Though I've done a lot to fix up what's needed and also a fair bit of  preventative maintenance,btohqsg
But no worries  you can test drive it,btohqsg

No no  saw scrapyard post & I just share. Maybe someone might be needing of A4 GB,btohqsg
I swapped out my 2.9L PDK GB for a 3.4L PDK GB last year due to shaft speed sensor implausible signal (hence error and no Sports or Sports Plus modes) üòÇ that I couldn't do on my own. üò¥,btohqsg
But while the workshop was performing the swap  they dropped engine so I took the opportunity to replace all the plastics and rubber hoses that could've degraded over time. Saved a bunch of costs on labour.,btohqsg
So my car and engine is 2009 but the GB is from 2011,btohqsg
Looking great  seem like you have pretty good knowledge on Porsche,btohqsg
I've done a fair bit of research. Also  online Forums and WhatsApp enthusiast groups really help too.,btohqsg
Although many will have their own opinions on what's best,btohqsg
