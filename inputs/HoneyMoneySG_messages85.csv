Been using OCBC BCIP to do monthly investment using SRS to buy Nikko AM STI ETF. Paying the min $5 fees.Realised poems cash+ charged 0.08% with no min is a better option. Although this is NOT AUTOMATED  need to ownself place order. Monthly $1400 investment only about $1.12 comms.1) so worthwhile to stop Ocbc BCIP and use POEMS cash plus instead?2) Although using SRS money  I still need have $1500 cash balance in cash plus in order to place buy orders? (Poems need this in case SRS not enough then they can convert to cash settlement).,btohqsg
Hello all  does anyone have any issues using Amaze on Singapore airlines?,btohqsg
why would u do that unless u trying to convert to online spend?,btohqsg
Erm  no. Cause I am booking 1 way trip from another country to SG. The booking currency is in local currency of that country.,btohqsg
ohhh sure then makes sense to use amaze  just make sure to pair it up with the most suitable mastercard u have,btohqsg
I have tried multiple times  didn't work. I just gave up and use Credit card directly,btohqsg
havent tried using amaze to buy air tix before so i wouldn't know as well,btohqsg

Hi I have some USD in Webull Margin account and money bull auto-sub is on  why this morning it does not subscribe ah  anyone knows?,btohqsg

How to get S$78 cash reward for existing OCBC customers?,btohqsg
what u mean? paylah only can topup from dbs/posb account  no cashback etc,btohqsg
Hi guys! For UOB evol or any credit cards  how do you track the cashback received? It‚Äôs my first month using it  just paid the bill due  don‚Äôt see it being offset  it‚Äôll reflect on next months‚Äôs bill or cashback credited directly to bank account?,btohqsg
Becos in google pay  I could still add in a bank account even though I had add in PayLah!,btohqsg
On how to track  you can search chat history using ‚Äúuob Evol track‚Äù.About when the cashback will be credited  you can read the Evol TnC clause no. 6Make sure you fulfil the clause no. 17-20 in Evol TnC.,btohqsg
Only able to add in PayLah!  OCBC and SC,btohqsg
How do I add in if my PayNow is POSB?,btohqsg
uh  does the merchant allow payment using paynow  or paylah only?,btohqsg
I had remove my PayLah and bank account from google pay payment methods as captured above üëÜ,btohqsg
However  when I press on PayNow to add in PayNow account. Only DBS PayLah  OCBC bank and SCB available,btohqsg
What needs to be done to add in my PayNow account using POSB?,btohqsg
So does PayLah! able to receive cash rewards earn from scratch cards in Google Pay?,btohqsg
in the first place does the merchant allow payment via paynow? or paylah only?,btohqsg
Hi guys  can I check what are you guys using to pay for annual insurance premiums at the moment?,btohqsg
Paylah and paynow are similar  right?No point having paylah,btohqsg
My objective is to receive the cash rewards from scratch card in google pay. I usually use google pay to transfer $$ to my friends and colleagues.,btohqsg
Paylah is a wallet that stores money. Paynow is a service that lets you transfer money from one wallet to another bank account.,btohqsg
Does anyone know how you can transfer the miles awarded for referrals in Kris+ to Krisflyer? I've managed to transfer those for purchases made  but somehow the miles awarded for referral cannot be transferred. Not sure if I'm somehow doing it wrongly. These miles I mentioned are still within 7 days.,btohqsg
Referral miles dont think is transferable,btohqsg
By disabling auto top up  PayLah limits your loss if you transferred wrong amount. Paynow transfers whatever wrong amount you entered n available amount in your account.,btohqsg
in that case u should get scratchcard if u transfer min $10 to friends on Gpay  doesn't matter funded by Paylah/ocbc/scb,btohqsg
"thanks that explains... does it mean the only way to utilise it is through the ""pay by miles"" option? Any other ways to utilize these miles? Sorry  new kris+ user here.",btohqsg
Yes  that is what I did but the google pay indicate that I need to link my PayNow account to get the cashback rewards,btohqsg
This is even though I had PayLah! already link in google pay,btohqsg
u need to link ur paynow account to receive the cashback,btohqsg
So how do I link my PayNow account when my PayNow is POSB? Google pay only have PayLah!  OCBC bank and SCB,btohqsg
Deactivate at posb bank account 1st,btohqsg
Lendlease promo still have as of now?,btohqsg
paylah/ocbc/scb is just for the source. When they send to you  your paynow will go wherever it's set up.For instance I right now have paynow set up to HSBC. When someone sent me $ on Google Pay it goes to my HSBC account.But for sending money I set it up as OCBC  when I send money through Google Pay it deducts from my OCBC account,btohqsg
How can i reach $4 per $1 dollar spend on Citi Premier Card.,btohqsg
Its a bit unclear in the T&Cs,btohqsg
generally it‚Äôs 1.2miles per $1 dollar for local spending.but during promotion may reach up to 4miles per $1 dollar (e.g.  Agoda linked bookings),btohqsg
2miles per $1 dollar if i recall correctly,btohqsg
yeh then on certain currencies its an additional $2,btohqsg
just trying to figure out reach ones,btohqsg
if u referring to the overseas promo  all foreign currencies ok. Need to register for the promo and fulfil $5000 spend in the month,btohqsg

Can i use hsbc advance credit card to pay for travel related transactions which were excluded from hsbc revolution?,btohqsg
I found this with a simple Google search,btohqsg
Thanks for the insightful sharing Chris! Love it!,btohqsg
Is it still worth it getting the uob lady solitaire card? 6 miles/$ seems like will end by 29 Feb. And the $5 block earn rate also not so enticing,btohqsg
$3k quota for 4 mpd (if it reverts back) is still quite good,btohqsg
And the $5 block doesn't affect uob lady solitaire much since the bonus is going to be based on accumulated spending. Will still get 5.6 mpd / 3.6 mpd. With such high quota it's still a good option,btohqsg
No rush since it end of season. If it reverts to 4mpd is good already. Now subscribers have exploded. Hopefully no nerfed fingers crossed.,btohqsg
Anyone use Lady card w Amaze for oversea shopping?,btohqsg
A lot of people asked this question in the past. You may find the answers in chat history. Perhaps search using ‚ÄúLady oversea amaze‚Äù,btohqsg

Hi  is there anyway to check the miles earned for each transaction by UOB krisflyer cc? The statment only shows the total miles earned for the entire month.,btohqsg

Hopefully will extend or i am back to DBS WWMC,btohqsg

Hi all  if i perform RSTP for my wife  is the topup sum also become reserved fund in her CPF SA? thanks for any advise.,btohqsg
Dear all Which Platform allow me to have Monthly RSP S&P500 ETF with dividends reinvested,btohqsg
If you do CPF shielding  your RA will be formed with your remaining SA + OA monies until FRS.Once you hit 55  you can return the shielded SA monies to your SA and you can keep it in SA to grow 4.08% or withdraw it out as long as you already hit FRS in RA.,btohqsg
All forms of RSTU will be reserved in SA.,btohqsg
IBKR allows u to schedule recurring investments  so u only need to make sure there is enough fund balance. I imagine u can have a fixed schedule to buy VOO. But dividend reinvesting  in US  they have DRIP  but not sure how we can do it here. Since trades are not totally free  hard to do small DRIP also even though we have fractional shares already.,btohqsg
Hi all  I have the following question.An individual currently self employed (no cpf contribution  no OA balance) with yearly tax bracket at 20%. Now paying current monthly mortgage loan with cash.Should he continue to pay with cash or topup cpf with cash then pay the mortgage loan with cpf? Can list down the pros and cons of doing so?Because by topping up cpf  can reduce tax. And need to pay for mortgage loan also anyway. But what are the cons by doing so?,btohqsg
At personal income at 20% bracket  he Shld incorporate a company and pay tax on the profits at corporate tax rate of 17%.Give himself salary of $800 a month then claim workfare  public transport concession card  max assurance package tier  etc.üòÜ,btohqsg
Top-up CPF -> tax reliefUse CPF-OA to pay loan -> accrued interestAccrued interest return back -> still your CPF moneyPay loan with cash -> no tax relief  cash return bank  never seen againThere are some work to use CPF-OA to pay for mortgage loanBut don't take my word for it.. ü§™,btohqsg
Thanks for the reply. Then after RA hit FRS after age 55  can I still top up SA using OA? Thanks!,btohqsg
No transfers from OA to SA after 55. That's why CPF shielding is a thing.,btohqsg

Hi guys  help a brother out. May i ask  if UOB Stash is offering 5% pa for their interest rate and CIMB FD is 3.5%  why would anyone choose FD?,btohqsg
Uob stash effective is 3 percent for 100k coz of tier interest. So if fd is 3.5 will beat it. But with the uob saving promo  the extra cash they give will increase the net reward to ard 4.6 to 4.7 percent,btohqsg
It doesn't pay 5%. it only pays that for a certain amount of your deposit. The Effective interest rate only works out to be 3% and that is why someone will want the CIMB FD,btohqsg
Hello experts‚Ä¶ anyone paid geneco electricity bill via cardup before?,btohqsg

Nope. Contactless is when it beeps against a terminal.While we're at it installments generally don't give any rewards.,btohqsg

Hi. I bought something that costs $300 via grab pay. For some reason  I don't want the item and the vendor refunded $300 back to my grab wallet. Noted I couldn't transfer anywhere else because the top up was made with cc earlier. I wonder is there any tips to spend or move the money from grab wallet. My hawker spending would take months to finish off $300. I wouldn't want to use grab pay to buy something expensive and noticed that using cc for that and being rewarded by cc is much better than earning grab points. Also I don't take grab transport or grab food,btohqsg
grabpay can move to your paynow no?,btohqsg
Cannot. Can't even transfer to another wallet also,btohqsg
That's the disclaimer. Unfortunately I will need to use the money for grab pay or grab services,btohqsg
That's correct. When you pay with GrabPay it's equivalent to top-up.,btohqsg

My household has 2 lady cards. We selected:1. Travel + dining2. Travel + fashionWe found it very useful to be able to use at many overseas places.For the other categories we are using:A) Citi cashback (groceries)B) Maybank fnf (pharmacy  5812  groceries)Finally we have as ultimate backup uob krisflyer.,btohqsg
For the fashion  is anything clothes stores  etc related is fine right?,btohqsg
No. This is the one u need to be very careful of.Fashion category of uob lady is one of the more tricky one to use.U can however do the amaze + empty wallet trick to find out the correct mcc first. Then only use lady fashion if it matches.Credits: milelion for screenshot.,btohqsg
unfortunately my groceries is below $800/mth,btohqsg
U might want to consider Maybank family and friends then. $800 across 5 categories. Surely can hit?,btohqsg
And my usual tip. U can consider sub your parents / parents in law for their grocery spending.Whether u want to collect back the money from them or not that‚Äôs up to u la.,btohqsg
But it does cap at $25/cat,btohqsg
$312.50 Loh.It‚Äôs to cater for people who say they cannot spend $800 a month on groceries.I mean there are 2 choices provided for big or small grocery spender albeit still need $800 spend a month.I have to say this although May get flamed. No use complaining I can‚Äôt hit xxx spend a month so I cannot benefit. Figure it out! Don‚Äôt miss out!,btohqsg
Does amaze+citi rewards qualify for singsaver promotion to spend min. $500?,btohqsg
Citi cashback is capped $80 cashback a month.Citi cashback+ (1.6% cashback) has no cap,btohqsg

Anyone tried to sell OCBC Blue Chip Investment Plan (BCIP) stocks purchased using SRS?OCBC charges 0.3%  expensive!Although it is BCIP  it is technically SRS stocks w agent bank. Thinking if can sell through Poems Cash+ - sell from SRS holdings.Call Ocbc  they of course say no.I can‚Äôt transfer BCIP securities to CDP also since they are purchased w SRS.Any ideas?,btohqsg
What if close OCBC SRS and change SRS to DBS?,btohqsg
You can try to do interbank transfer of SRS account  similar to CPF-IA.You need to physically go to the branch of the bank you want to transfer to  and queue for counter services. Then inform the service officer that you want to do an interbank transfer of your SRS account.Bring along your physical IC and standby your original SRS account number.You will need to signTWOforms. New SRS account and transfer of SRS account.For CPF-IA interbank transfer  it's the same process  just that instead of SRS account number  you standby your original CPF-IA number.,btohqsg
Thanks! Wonder if the BCIP SRS stocks would move to new agent bank or not.,btohqsg
Should be fine I think. They allow you to invest in another agent bank even if your SRS account is not under them. Vice versa. But you should check with the service officer to confirm.,btohqsg
The savings:If I have $100k of G3B in SRS BCIP to sell  OCBC charges 0.3% or $300.If I can move it to another SRS bank  sell through FSM  pay $8.80 flat.Worth the trouble?,btohqsg
For SRS BCIP  you cannot transfer out. Only can sell then buy in FSM one.,btohqsg
Wondering if u change SRS agent bank.. can the SRS BCIP stocks still stay w Ocbc?Guess they force u sell BCIP then,btohqsg
Best to check with CSO  maybe can come back here with the answer.,btohqsg

If you recently applied you probably would get the free credit score report from banks  check at credit bureau. If you applied too many cards too fast it might affect your credit score and lead to rejection for further credit facility,btohqsg

Sorry  I am new to CPF Investment Account.Given:- OA 60k + SA 40k > $60 000 (OA > 20k not entitled for additional 1% interest)- OA > 20k interest is only 2.5% p.a.I am considering to place my OA funds in OCBC Fixed Deposit (3.1% p.a.).Since the CPF interest payment is computed based on the lowest balance for the month  I am planning to:1) Perform the FD placement from CPF OA on the 1st day of the month.2) Upon maturity  perform FD placement again - without transferring back to CPF OA account (to avoid interest loss).May I know if my plan is feasible?*P/S: I have considered T-bills with higher return but it could ending up losing more interest due to the CPF interest calculation method.,btohqsg
Doesn't have to be foreign currency,btohqsg
yeah the answer is based on the original poster's questions of why people using amaze even though it has worse foreign currency conversion rate,btohqsg
Hi  anyone with recent conversion of citi rewards pts to krisflyer miles??? How long does it take to reflect on your krisflyer acct????,btohqsg
1. They will compute combined balances in this order: RA (if over 55) > OA (capped 20k) > SA > MA.2. You can only use CPF-OA monies above the first 20k for investments.Below 55  the first 20k of your OAALWAYSgets the 1% interest before SA/MA  at the rate of 3.5% p.a.,btohqsg
Amaze pair with Citi Rewards is better than Amaze wallet. Reason being higher cashback from Citi Rewards (2.27%),btohqsg
Actual name is Instarem Amaze card  u have to pair with a master card inside Instarem Amaze app.,btohqsg
Thanks.I see. Given:OA: 60kSA: 40kThen the interest rate for 40k in OA should be 2.5% p.a. hence I can place them in FD.,btohqsg

$15300 for SRS. Cap no idea for SA I as I am those who transfers OA to SA last time,btohqsg
Can do top up to SA and SRS on same year? and tax relief for both SA top up and SRS top up?,btohqsg
RSTU is $8K for self (total combined with BHS MA VC). SRS is $15.3K. both relief can be claimed in the same yr. Chris' year-end video touched on these,btohqsg
"SRS and it's investments won't give you the guaranteed 4.08% risk free interest.It's very misleading for you to say ""tax relief is for high income people"".Your median income earner would definitely hit the 7% tax bracket and in calculations pay at least 2k in income taxes.And if your point of getting tax reliefs by topping up SRS  your next point of paying taxes and fees to withdraw from SRS early won't make sense anymore.Your CPF life payouts don't get assessed as income  but withdrawing SRS after the retirement age does.Nothing wrong doing either/both ways  but it's best to lay it out for people who ask and let them pick what's best suited for them.",btohqsg
Hi  does anybody know if paying conservancy charges by credit card counts towards the uob one account card spend?,btohqsg
Thks for the reminder.  Forgot needs to maintain 6months.  Will close after 6months then.  Again thks. üëç,btohqsg
To choose between top up OA or SRS. I prefer SRS help to save tax but in the event you need to take out the money  you can do so with some penalty. You can‚Äôt with CPF. That why top up CPF is for high income earner who don‚Äôt need a backup plan. SRS can save as much as $3k of tax per year. you can also buy SSB or stocks without much restrictions at least for SG blue chip dividend stock to try make up for that 4% yield.,btohqsg
"Top-up OA?SRS is also meant for retirement  if you ""need to take out the money""  you have to re-evaluate your savings for rainy day.",btohqsg
For my case  I already above FRS. Can‚Äôt top up anymore. Thus SrS. But in the early years I have been contributing to SRS and transfer OA to SA.,btohqsg
SRS is another layer on top of the base CPF. How many here have SRS.Most friends I know don‚Äôt have.,btohqsg
You cannot even top-up OA  less getting tax relief from it... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èBut if you're talking about SA then like I said before  nothing wrong doing either/both ways  lay out the facts  let them evaluate. Let them decide if they want to put somewhere that grows4.08% p.a. risk-free by defaultor somewhere that they have to invest the money to try challenge against that. Not forgetting the OA he puts in FD can be returned to OA and still be used for housing or education without penalty.No one said topping up SRS is wrong  I'm sure the people here who have hit FRS on SA are topping up SRS already.,btohqsg

It is a better alternative if people want to put money for relief but may have plan in the future to use the money to seek better yield or opportunities if they need. Put in CPF  money is gone till you hit the age while SRS still give you the flexibility to use it if required. CPF still get fill up every month from work anyway.,btohqsg
Housing or education will still be covered by the CPF you contributing every month unless you take loan that are higher than your CPF contribution ,btohqsg
No right no wrong but just offering a view that If you want tax relief  SRS offer a viable alternative in case they need the money earlier in life. You still can use the SRS for investment and with less restrictions than OA.,btohqsg

Hi  just to confirm UOB Krisflyer CC do not allow pooling of UNI$?,btohqsg
correct. no pooling with other UOB cards,btohqsg
in the first place UOB KF CC doesn't earn UNI$  it earns KF miles that are directly deposited in your KF account,btohqsg
UOB KF does not have UNI$ to start with  it credits miles directly to your KF account,btohqsg
wow so i avoid the $25 transfer fee,btohqsg
Yes but do note that also means your KF miles expiry starts immediately,btohqsg
shld be fine as KF miles has 3 years expiry,btohqsg
i think the bad thing abt the card is me waiting 14mths for the bonus points to be credited,btohqsg
They credit slightly earlier from DP so far. I personally got 13K+ miles in the month of Jan even though my spending for December is like 4K (with 3K++ not on SIA group)(My card's annual mth is Jan),btohqsg
but yeah  depends on your take i guess  do u intend to use the miles soon?Overall i find it a pretty nice card given u get uncapped 3mpd (provided u fulfil the $800 spend requirement on SIA group)   along with the scoot benefits,btohqsg

The NAV has dropped at an annual rate of about 3.5% while it distributes 4.5-6%. So all things netting out you can also think of it like a bond that has returned 1-2.5% (if you had reinvested part of the distributions to cover the drop in NAV),btohqsg

When u are high income u might hit the $80k tax relief cap. Then u cannot benefit at all from cpf Topup.My alternative view is to Topup your cpf as early in life as possible to start earning 4% pa (transfer all from oa to sa).But that was my era days when interest rates were Low and it made sense to Topup with cash (bank paid 0.5-1% interest vs special account earning 4% pa.Considerations are:1. Do u need your cash2. Do u need your oaBefore u move all oa to sa.,btohqsg

For Moneybull  the conversion rate is S$1 = USD0.7297 or USD1 = S$1.3704.When converting back from USD to SGD using current market rate USD1 =S$1.3424  we immediately loss close to SGD$3000 in exchange rate  Hence the total earn from promo is only about SGD$1k ++am I correct ?,btohqsg
Im not sure if you need to convert to USD  then lock it in the short term treasury with 5.8% yields  then convert back to SGD to withdraw free of charge. But either way theres a FOREX conversion loss  so your gains may not be 5.8% esp with larger amounts of cashAlso just be careful moomoo as a broker isnt as reliable as larger ones like IBKR or TOS  and your cash needs settlement of 2-3 days (due to lack of liquidity by smaller brokers)  before you can withdraw after the60 days,btohqsg
Incorrect  you could just leave in SGD and won't be exposed to FX Risk,btohqsg
So activate moneybull can be in SGD?Transfer in S$138k  activate moneybull  it will auto subscribe SGD fund?,btohqsg
Your 20k in ocbc 360 will not earn the save bonus  but others like salary or card spend will apply if you've met the requirements,btohqsg

DBS WWMC: 4mpd up to 2k per cal monthUOBKF: 3mpd on SIA and scoot no cap,btohqsg
Hi  if card linked into Fairprice app  is it considered online spending?,btohqsg
6mpd if you have upb lady‚Äôs solitaire card with travel category,btohqsg
For $10k cardup fee is 2.25% or $225. You get 12 000 miles.So you are paying 1.8 cents per mile,btohqsg
Thinking of getting a no-frills miles card in addition to my uob lady card. Was wondering below -Is there any big diff btwUOB PPVandCiti CRMC + amazeBoth 4mpd on online spendUOB PPVallows contactless payment via Apple Pay Amaze CRMCuse physical amaze cardBonus capped at $1110 and $1000 spending per monthDBS WWMC‚Äì 4mpd on online spend capped at $2k  amaze nerfed  cannot convert offline spend to online spendHSBC Revo‚Äì 4mpd on contactless/online spend capped at $1k  travel and OTA nerfedI would thinkUOB PPVis better for local spending andDBS WWMCfor travel bookings. Is there anything I missed out? Any advice? TIA! üòä,btohqsg
If you only want one more card then choose uob ppv because it pools with your uob ladys.Is travel related transaction part of the allow list for uob ppv though? I'm not sure. Note that mobile contactless only refers to you tapping mobile device on a terminal,btohqsg
Oh yes travel related excluded from UOB PPV online. Missed that out. Thanks!,btohqsg
Guys. If kris+ and uob merchant  happen to be the same. Then i use kris+ to pay using uob krisflyer. Does it clock the card point?Cause i read t&c of krisflyer uob. They say miles will not be awarded for uob merchant,btohqsg
"Yes. Clocks (Provided u go via Kris+)Paying via this method is like using Shopback  Amaze or what other payment processor to ""get around"" paying directlty",btohqsg
use the lady's card to clock travel spends instead of DBS WMCC. this way you pool everything under UOB (w PPV),btohqsg
yup just in case i've exceeded the $3k capped for the month already  which card would you recommend?,btohqsg
Thanks. Can advice what the difference on contactless  online   offline spend  mobile contactlessI see liao confused,btohqsg
i think HSBC revo travel/OTA via Atome not nerfed. WWMC is viable  but note the points only valid for 12 months  rather short imo,btohqsg
And if let say its a uob merchant  how can i pay using the uob krisflyer? Cause if i tap or apple pay. Then cant clock miles right?Then if the shop dont have shopback or anything. Then how,btohqsg
And if KF miles gonna expire. Anyway to tt to kris+ ? Then tt back. Will it extend?,btohqsg
Transfer to Kris+ cannot transfer back,btohqsg
What way you recommend to extend the miles,btohqsg
Use before they expire or you pay to extend. Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any other way to extend,btohqsg
Ps. For people that participated in the webull shares transfer in promotion. Once ibkr has transferred the stock to webull how do you get the statement of proof from ibkr to submit to webull? Under clause 6.5,btohqsg
If you use kris+ the merchant is kris+ so you do circumvent the uob$ merchant thing,btohqsg
yup that's one of my concerns also. As a spare card might not clock much points/miles  and have to pay conversion fee. If not can only clock on other UOB card with lower earn rates since the UNI$ can pool  or cashback cards,btohqsg
Layer it with Amaze  then transaction becomes Amaze * ...,btohqsg
During months of travel spend  don‚Äôt hit your lady‚Äôs card limit and divert those spend to other cards (PPV  CRM etc),btohqsg
u can go to IBKR website and submit a ticket? or either check from your transaction history on traderstation ALso  when the assets/options are transferred  there should be an email confirming the transfer.Im more familiar with TOS  i transferred from TOS to IBKR,btohqsg
But latest t&c say amaze transaction cant clock liao,btohqsg
Ah ok icic. Because ibkr removed the shares I am transferring from my account but there's no email yet. And webull hasn't received it as well,btohqsg
oh usually ACAT takes 3-8 days  you can put a web ticket on IBKR website to ask them for proof that you transferred and submit the ACAT transfer statements to WebullYour mileage may vary if you are transferring less liquid shares  or shares OTC (out of counter)  like i own some russian shares they cant be transferrred  or if you own NESTLE stock  these are less liquid shares that arent on NYSE etc (i think  in case im smoking you),btohqsg
Where got. Probably just Amaze * Transit not all Amaze trx,btohqsg
Oh nah mine is just googl stock. 1 stock only. Haha thank you!!,btohqsg
Amaze lo (million wrote an article on this),btohqsg

Sorry.. can i double confirm on this? Last heard few weeks ago from hsbc cso that egiro are not eligible... either that the cso is new üòÇ,btohqsg
I set up paper giro de  not sure about egiro. Alterntively can just clock the insurance on your cc via axs then giro for your cc,btohqsg
Thank you Darren for clarifying ü´∞,btohqsg
I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs exclusions for giro,btohqsg
Just an example haha üòÖ and cap is 500 instapoints  meaning $250 per transaction only,btohqsg
for the 4mpd on hsbc revo  need to be online also  and based on recent datapoints  Atome has not been online,btohqsg
Someone on another chat mentioned for DBS cards it‚Äôs coded online. UOB and Citi aren‚Äôt. HSBC nobody mentioned,btohqsg
At 0.5 point is 1k spending  at 1point is 500 spending,btohqsg
interesting  quite strange that the bank affects online or not,btohqsg
ya  talking about atome in this context,btohqsg
Seth‚Äôs channel  2 different folks shared. One wwmc one livefresh  both online,btohqsg
Okie just checking cos I got scared for a bit HAHAHA,btohqsg
Previously some folks also shared Kopitiam via FairPrice app no longer coded online  esp on UOB. But I‚Äôve still been getting them as online rebates via EVOL. I wonder if something backend messed up temporarily and revert again,btohqsg

"Hey guys I'm going to ask a very stupid question for uob rising dragon challenge willAfter i select the amount lets say  50k will this 50k gets the uob monthly interestThe reason forcthe ask is because in tnc it states ""earmark"" mean the amount deposited will not be reflected in participating account statement",btohqsg
wanna buy air ticket which card more suitable for use  Ôºå want no min spend required,btohqsg
Uob ladies card with travel cat currently 6mpd,btohqsg
Yes atome mcc can get 10x points on hsbc revo,btohqsg
Cannot find what you said. Only find today ppl just reply online spend. Not sure where you getting your info from,btohqsg
Tough read but yes will still get interest.,btohqsg
Only see NTUC fairprice don't see kopitiam... But it's clocking for me so idk ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,btohqsg
Anyway as I‚Äôve mentioned in the original post  it‚Äôs now back to‚ÄòOnline‚Äô,btohqsg
Maybe I didn't use it during the periods it became offline,btohqsg
Maybe  bc it‚Äôs quite a known thing for a few months. Thankfully it‚Äôs back to online now,btohqsg
how many bonus pt will i get next statement month ? if i max out the 2k,btohqsg
3.6k  it is illustrated in the cc tnc. U can read it up,btohqsg
very hard to earn 2000 instapoint in 1 year,btohqsg
Hi Sorry some stupid question on UOB one saving promotion.I plan to put in 100k on 31st Jan so that my ADB will be 100k on 1st feb onwards ( 100k X 29 days/29 days).However   can  i credit my salary to UOB first prior to 31 jan( etc. today) and try to spend $500 first?,btohqsg
Then you will clock the bonus interest for Jan instead. Which won't have 100k inside. You still have to have 1.6k salary credit and 500 spending next month.,btohqsg
Can I ask for an increase to my credit limit  even if my income doesn‚Äôt increase?I have a CC  reaching one year soon but bank didn‚Äôt offer me anything.,btohqsg
You can try calling in ask  they will ask for income statement before any increase can be approved,btohqsg
Hi  is asking for referral code/links allowed?,btohqsg

Can uob lady link with amaze to book overseas hotels?,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúLady amaze oversea hotel‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.Good luck to you and enjoy your rewards accumulation journey.,btohqsg
Can I check if you have insufficient funds in your bank when a giro payment hits  will it try again in a few days or is it considered a late payment for your giro bill?,btohqsg
Must use it by linking to Amaze Wallet or can linked with credit card instead  when paying with Amaze card?,btohqsg
https://www.instarem.com/terms-policies/amaze-terms-conditions/#the-amaze-reward(b) the Amaze Transaction was made with linked card as the primary payment method or funding source.,btohqsg
Usually will have 1 backup attempt but you should check with the billing organisation if considered late.,btohqsg
Looks like this promo is for linked card only.,btohqsg
I remember somebody asked this question before. You can use keyword ‚ÄúGiro fail‚Äù to search chat history related to this query and see what others reply.,btohqsg
How do you found out this?,btohqsg
I checked uob one card tnc. Insurance is under exclusions,btohqsg
Usually will not try again  and failed giro bill payment will incur giro handling fee (usually waivable if u request to waive). Need to manual pay with another method before due date.,btohqsg
should look at tnc of uob one account  insurance count to card spend for bonus interest but not to the cc rebate/points,btohqsg
Hi all  when put SGD $$ in webull  how do we activate for SGD Fullerton fund?,btohqsg
Noted let me read the account tnc,btohqsg
only self-initiated giro is excluded  egiro NOT excluded,btohqsg
I am referring to UOB One account but not UOB One credit card.https://www.uob.com.sg/web-resources/personal/pdf/personal/save/chequeing/one-account/uob-one-account-card-spend.pdf,btohqsg
Out of curiosity  where one is reaching the 100k bal in uob 1 account  can one withdraw appropriate sums of cash so not to reach the cap of 100K and still continue with the salary crediting and 500 mthly credit card charged and earn the high interest ?,btohqsg
can withdraw. Btw note that $100k is average monthly balance  not absolute amount in balance.,btohqsg
Yeah okay üëçGood infor to use this to our advantage,btohqsg
Is based on average monthly balance  not based on the last day when uob calculated the interest payout?,btohqsg
uh  of cos not last day  all days in the month considered,btohqsg
I tried to exploit a loophole and it didn't work.,btohqsg
are u sure it is egiro?,btohqsg
if it worked it's a crazy loophole but I can't elaborate further,btohqsg
self-initiated giro/egiro excluded  auto egiro bill payment not excluded,btohqsg
lol  think u tried the wrong way,btohqsg
I'm getting 1% Cashback for my insurance premium which was setup using egiro  no issue at all.,btohqsg
Unless they just amend the TNC recently,btohqsg
yah  ur insurance is auto egiro bill payment so get 1%,btohqsg
My egiro is setup by me electronically  is this considered self-initiated?,btohqsg
My understanding is:Giro= not recurring  it's one time giro instructionEgiro=once setup  it will be recurring,btohqsg
no lah  giro bill payment is recurring. difference between giro and egiro is giro is setup by submitting physical form  egiro is submit application online/in-app,btohqsg
not self-initiated  as the bill payment is auto,btohqsg
Yes  so regarding it's giro or egiro  as long as it is recurring payment  then will qualified for 1% cashback. If it is normal payment via giro/fast  then excluded.,btohqsg
yes if recurring via application where there is link up between billing organisation and the funding bank,btohqsg
This one should be re-phrased to:One time giro payment is excluded. Recurring giro/egiro payment NOT excluded.,btohqsg
Hi expert  I've registered SCB card and participate in card on file cash rewards with spending of 20 dollar on selected merchant within 30days. May I know the 30days is transaction date or posting date.,btohqsg
lol could be one-time but not self-initiated also. If there is some giro/egiro application to link up billing organisation and the funding bank then should get 1%,btohqsg
Haha  I think no matter what it will be considered as self-initiated  because we are the one want it to be.,btohqsg
lol  yah but dun take it too literal lah,btohqsg
I manage to find a way to consistently max out the 1% GIRO cashback from HSBC ($500 a month).,btohqsg
please don't share else it will be gone,btohqsg
Be prepare to get ready all documents to support your transactions. Failure to show proof of transactions during audit will result all your past cashback crawled back by bank.,btohqsg
The uob one account  the credit card spending is from when to when?,btohqsg
Calendar month?If I got my cc 15 jan.To get the cashback I need to spend before 31 Jan $500?,btohqsg
Hi all experts  is it worth buying United SGD fund from UOB fund manager,btohqsg
You need your $500 transactionspostedlatest on 31 Jan.Most vendors will take 1-2 business days  some especially non local vendors may take 3-5 business days.,btohqsg
SCB smart vs Citi mrt which is better for simply go ?,btohqsg
Hi guys  UOB Krisflyer debit card can link with instarem amaze and UOB one account for cashback and  eligible spending?,btohqsg
for uob one account confirm nope. not sure about amaze,btohqsg
You spend 500 today then no need to worry le ü§£,btohqsg
What‚Äôs your outlook on the market? Generally speaking  actively managed funds are a bad idea in the long term due to high fees and poor track record of the industry (fund managers) as a whole.If you have strong belief that the particular sector/factor (in this case  investment-grade bonds) will outperform  then maybe can try having some portfolio allocation as a  side bet.,btohqsg
cashback? u were asking about uob one account intetest?,btohqsg
I only answered first question on UOB One account interest. What card are you using?,btohqsg
Cashback and bonus interest two different things,btohqsg
This will be based onposted statement date. If you didn't change the statement date  it will roughly be on the card received date by default.,btohqsg
When did moomoo credited the remaining % of interest to your account after reaching 30/60 days?,btohqsg

Ahh awesome! Thank you!! I‚Äôll check them out!,btohqsg
