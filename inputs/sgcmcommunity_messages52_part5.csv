Juz not many ppl it seems on mcf who speaking frm experience on tourador haha,btohqsg
Look for eco tyre. Tyres are the only thing that is btwn the car u and the road.Anything on the road  the grip of the tyre can help save ur car frm flying or skidding,btohqsg
Falken Ziex ZE310 ecorun (tried)Yokohama bluearth (yet to try)Bridgestone ecopia (current)All these are eco tyres,btohqsg
Thanks for the recommendation! Haha i was trying to look for a brand called eco tyres üòÇ,btohqsg
How was the falken and bridgestone so far in your opinion?,btohqsg
The marketing tactics and business strategy is great for sure,btohqsg
@Jingxunnhas used Bridgestones before and will be able to advise better,btohqsg
I personally prefer Michelins  PS4 and primacy 4,btohqsg
Although currently on p zero which are alright too,btohqsg
Falken grip actually quite good.. but damn noisy..Bridgestone so far slightly better  damn little rolling resistance  better fuel consumption  but the grip not so good during dry compared to wet roads,btohqsg
The bridgestone grip not so good during dry.. but wont like backside slide out or what during like those sharp turns into expressway rite haha,btohqsg
Always give way to vehicles coming from your right side,btohqsg
Rule #1. Know the rules but practise defensive driving in roundabouts.Rule A#2. Practise defensive driving in roundabouts. Give way where possible üòÅ,btohqsg
okay la tbf i only used bridgestine perf tyres before,btohqsg
RE71r  Re004  Potenza Sport and S007a. S007a is the kind of tyre that doesnt suit my driving style because when im pushing it tends to be abit unpredictable. The first i believe provide better feedback than any other tyres ive use like PS4 and PS4S mainly because bridgestone have a stup!dly stiff tyrewall. But it doesnt come with a downside of being noisier and more uncomfortable.,btohqsg
The dry and wet grip on the first 3 is also damn good haha  only downside is it wears pretty fast,btohqsg
My weekend was fun  met up with the honda boys and had a very nice dinner with my partner,btohqsg
"I see.Their 18"" is the X speed model (B rating for rain). A better model. You can try.I used the 15"" X wonder model (C rating for rain) for are 50 000 mileage.When floor is wet  It when move off from carpark gantry exit area(this area always slippery)stoping to red light and moving off from red light.",btohqsg
