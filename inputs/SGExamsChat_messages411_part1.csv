Reminds me of those fun learning books,btohqsg
I know that now but at the time I was like,btohqsg
I am finally releasing the A level version next year  2nd edition. Took too long :(,btohqsg
Imma go allout of chem p1,btohqsg
I’d be interested to get a copy ngl. I’ve been meaning to catch back up to the syllabus,btohqsg
Sometimes I look at A level questions,btohqsg
And I know the knowledge is somewhere in my brain,btohqsg
Except nobody sexts ten minute long messages,btohqsg
but this year happy  hit many of the A level explain questions. Is whether students remember,btohqsg
too bad I don't study physics,btohqsg
I look at A level questions. After 14 years  I still learning that there are things I didn't know,btohqsg
Yea but there’s just certain topics that I haven’t had any reason to touch in years,btohqsg
Like the scariest classes in uni for me to TA are the first year ones lol,btohqsg
Moral of the story I shared with my students  you will never finish learning  there will always be more things you don't know.So just prep enough and don't over stress for the exams,btohqsg
I shouldn’t even put in so much wasted time to tell him stuff that he wouldn’t bother reading anyways.,btohqsg
What I’ve told people is that my Uni first year midterm came out an exact question from my JC prelims,btohqsg
Hmm ok  I will talk to the admin when it is done to see if I am able to offer it at a discount.,btohqsg
I don’t mind just buying full price since it’s just a reference,btohqsg
I’ve paid hundreds of dollars for some textbooks,btohqsg
my prof brought in a 160 dollar nice textbook on topological band theory,btohqsg
I had this thing I wasn't sure when I was O level  on why pd can be measured across primary coil in an ideal transformer,btohqsg
And immediately uses it as a ruler on the whiteboard,btohqsg
A coil was just wires with no resistance for ideal transformer,btohqsg
never re-visit this own question until this year  where suddenly in the middle of the night I woke up and understood,btohqsg
Faraday and Lenz must have visited me in my dreams and taught me,btohqsg
I have intensive googling skills when I don’t get smth,btohqsg
a lot of A level physics questions still carry many assumptions and at times I think about how it’d be like removing said assumptions,btohqsg
me too. But hard to trust all the answers. Plus the phrasing can be quite off.,btohqsg
Last time whenever I google a concept  first site is hyperphysics,btohqsg
Now the algorithm learned and just pumps out research papers,btohqsg
hyperphysics has some parts that were a bit off  but I can't remember,btohqsg
Do they remove said assumptions when you get to the PhD studies level,btohqsg
and it was last year that I suddenly understood polarisation even more,btohqsg
I mean the fundamental idea of Physics is first working with a model we know how to deal with and slowly extending to the more messy situations  so yes for my classes but in research it depends,btohqsg
Like in my second year classical mechanics  the first thing we immediately did was solve a differential equation for free fall,btohqsg
since we have air resistance drag now,btohqsg
And then the rocket equation  which is conservation of momentum with a changing mass and velocity,btohqsg
But a lot of these harder situations require more math as well  sometimes way beyond H2 level  and A level physics doesn’t quite make use of the different branches,btohqsg
@GwynLimy u so tilted by some online stranger,btohqsg
This is why physics is always going to be more superior than biology.,btohqsg
I’m low key looking forward to TAing,btohqsg
i look forward to crashing ur class,btohqsg
Well  good enough  i ship it,btohqsg
only i can cuz he saw what a mess sim is,btohqsg
Depends which time in the class,btohqsg
It might have also been boring cos I alr know the stuff they teaching,btohqsg
A lecture I’m attending or a lecture I’m giving,btohqsg
Is anything ever really boring when I’m around,btohqsg
Exactly. You’re welcome for my presence.,btohqsg
I might give talks at conferences next year idk,btohqsg
