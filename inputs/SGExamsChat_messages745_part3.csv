They said students can't bring either to school,btohqsg
My friend wears this to sch alot no one cares,btohqsg
ite any color can but i see alot ppl wear white shoe,btohqsg
Meanwhile my friend brought a penknife and that was allowed,btohqsg
Yes because they said both are dangerous,btohqsg
There was also another garbage rule in my school  now that I think about it...my school was actually pretty lax,btohqsg
Cause the most absurb rule was you could not use the lockers,btohqsg
Like wtf...the lockers outside our classroom for show ah,btohqsg
i don't get y sec sch so uptight on SOCKS LENGTH. how isit gonna affect our learning?,btohqsg
School spend money build the lockers then don't allow anybody to use...ffs go figure,btohqsg
I heard some schools practice mental games on their students,btohqsg
Like they specifically create rules that target your mental fortitude...rules that sounds very useless etc,btohqsg
Then In my pri they banned the sales of bottled drinks because the school had enough of students using them as soccerballs,btohqsg
Anyone here knows how to cook,btohqsg
My pri sch had a country eraser ban,btohqsg
because we keep playing and selling them like trading cards,btohqsg
I don't cook  but I know how to. Usually I just fo 7-11 to buy wraps,btohqsg
Technically anything can be made at home,btohqsg
Its js if u have the skills for it,btohqsg
Na the real question is what do u wanna eat,btohqsg
Gotta have people to cook for ngl,btohqsg
Anyone want try hua tiao chiew + salt + chicken that's pan fried,btohqsg
That's cantonese food if u add flour,btohqsg

my school has a rule that you cannot walk across the field,btohqsg
ppl can wear wtv socks they want now  as long as it's not explicit,btohqsg
try having a rule where you cant open doors unless permission was given from a adult üíÄ,btohqsg
rvhs has a rule that you can't leave the school till your cca ends i.e. you can't leave sch during your long ass breaks,btohqsg
actl dhs also technically but the thing is NO ONE follows them,btohqsg
Ik some schools impose this because it can be rather costly to maintain the grass especially in our insanely hot weather. So people are only allowed to use the field when it has to be used like when playing matches,btohqsg
This is by right applicable to all camps  not just tekong,btohqsg
i mean you could..just had to face discipline,btohqsg
Coz y‚Äôall know how to levitate?,btohqsg
I thought coz Air Force = Above All (rules),btohqsg
Hope the French govt wins big,btohqsg
I was with the Advance and Overcome ‚Ä¶ it sounded very much like our paths are filled with trepidations üòÆ‚Äçüí®,btohqsg
You can't. This is the real point. Don't accept the lie of religion  socialism  capitalism. We are a fucked species. Know it. Hope is smash-able  realism is not. Protect yourself with the truth.,btohqsg
Hahahah coz I made that up LOL trying to blind test how NS are you lol,btohqsg

later ns the sergeant be like : HURRY UP MY GRANDMA CAN WALK FASTER THAN YOU,btohqsg
later ns the sergeant be like : HURRY UP MYGRANDMAGRANDMOTHER CAN WALK FASTER THAN YOU,btohqsg
Pronouncing ‚Äúmother‚Äù like ‚Äúmudder‚Äù has a special impact,btohqsg
