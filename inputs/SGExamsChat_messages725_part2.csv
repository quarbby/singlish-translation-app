"if u say ""i don't hear metal""",btohqsg
this guy is gonna execute you like xi jinping,btohqsg
but tbh@juicecogensone side of my hime cut is slightly thicker than the other even though i alr ask the aunty to fix it so ngl i think she isnt the best at doing himecutand then last time i ask her cut like 1cm off my ends she cut off alot then i was damn pissed,btohqsg
ooh alot of ppl take that in acjc,btohqsg
Is he still the same tho,btohqsg
then again its not very visible that one side is thicker so i just close one eye,btohqsg
What I only knew of 2 others doing that,btohqsg

Ya lo my a levels the subjects I hate I do well but those I love end up no A,btohqsg
guys i just learnt today that KI can be used as your contrasting subject,btohqsg
Yes it’s a subject of its own category,btohqsg
i thought Ki only replaces GP,btohqsg
It’s not even considered an arts subject,btohqsg
I gave one of his friends advice for eae to psych,btohqsg
Oh chey? Didn't know I was old enough but sure.,btohqsg
Just like how MOB and POA are commerce subjects,btohqsg

but like i somehow got personal attacked in that period by him,btohqsg
WHAT KIND OF COMBI IS THAT,btohqsg
actl i wonder the percentage of ppl doing BCMKI/PCMKI  using KI as the contrasting  as opposed to those doing the KI + Lit/hist combiscause most ppl I see who take KI take with econs +lit/hist/ell,btohqsg
this would be your average nyjc combi tho,btohqsg
acjc cannot cos of the stupid maths rule,btohqsg
Since can take 5H2 last time with the 90rp system provided you take KI,btohqsg
They talk like I am an adult lmao,btohqsg
Wait is it the sgexam disc is mostly poly while here is mostly jc ppl,btohqsg
i dont go to jc so idk what these combi names are lol,btohqsg
poor rose  she wanted to take BCMh but got BMEh,btohqsg
basically right in caps R H2 subjs,btohqsg
but this mf expects you to understand everything AFTER YOU HAVE NOT STUDIED SINCE YOUR O LEVELS,btohqsg
is it h2 bio h2 math h2 econs and h1 history,btohqsg
why would you take just bio  theres no science courses that wants you if you solely take bio lol,btohqsg
but acjc didn't offer ki since 2022,btohqsg
I agree that's why im here,btohqsg
i aint joining no sg reddit dicord bruh,btohqsg
Now Acjc doesn’t even offer KI,btohqsg
