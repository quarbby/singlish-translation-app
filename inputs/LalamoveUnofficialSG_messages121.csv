Key in the pin and it does not work,btohqsg

Hi guys. I have an enquiry. For cash orders in particular. Collect cash and earnings are different amounts. There is a minus amount for commission and driver service tax. How does this amount be deducted if the order is a cash order?,btohqsg
Deduct from ur wallet. If ur wallet empty or negative u cannot pick cash job. So u need to do some credit job to keep balance in wallet. Or u can top up minimum 20,btohqsg
Hi guys  do y'all receive the amount into your wallet immediately after your trip is done? Mine hasn't been updated for hours.,btohqsg
Sometimes if the order is under review you won‚Äôt get immediately,btohqsg
Then ask yr friend what things he done wrong loh. Only he know himself... And the truth will be known,btohqsg
He told me he also not sure,btohqsg
Next week go ask what happen,btohqsg
They will always msg and ask to fill up some kind of online form ..definately your friend know what happened,btohqsg
If cancel order will get suspend ?,btohqsg
Deliver into the reservoir or forest? Hahaha,btohqsg
Hey guys  which courier is using these timeslots ahFor same day,btohqsg
Hey guys  if usually wait long at customer place  you guys claim after sending item or when collect item?,btohqsg
If credit just leave the item and claim. Then if cash dont claim until they transfer the money,btohqsg
Dont bother waste your time. Time = money.,btohqsg

If no good reason with document proof will suspend.  Sometimes 1 day only,btohqsg
Yes live chat then state the reason for cancellation,btohqsg
The live chat response can be quite slow hor?,btohqsg
And everytime u do delivery have to drive  navigate and also wait for chat,btohqsg
If not agent come in disconnect u need to wait again,btohqsg
That's y I always say their support for drivers cmi,btohqsg

This week will be at Thursday (usually Wednesday mornings on non holiday day),btohqsg
All the ‚Äòcourier‚Äô jobs are back üòÇ,btohqsg
Rain good.. no riders fare super high,btohqsg
That was yesterday right? Today fares are back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô and more courier jobs rather than car,btohqsg
Yes this was ytd. Today fare like shit. Focus back to grab,btohqsg
Ytd I was shock by the fare,btohqsg
guys  now drivers commision is 76%??,btohqsg
lalamove used to take 16% from us  now they taking 24%??,btohqsg
I think no sticker they will take more comms. With sticker less comms,btohqsg
Hi guys  Cashout Pay haven‚Äôt out yet right today?,btohqsg
Ya. That's why they keep pestering pple to paste sticker.,btohqsg
nah its cos i no stickerüòÇüòÇüòÇ,btohqsg

Yeah  different commission for stickers and non-stickers,btohqsg
HelloPretty new hereFor pick up locations whereby there is parking fee  do you drivers usually bear the parking charges ?Thanks,btohqsg
So I don't pickup those with parking fee LOL,btohqsg
Or count by min  or long grace period,btohqsg
IcSo those commercial buildings or shopping mallsHave to avoid LorShopping mall = we cannot park at their loading bay right ?,btohqsg
If driving van or lorry  can park. But  some loading bay also have parking charges.,btohqsg
Parking is have parking. I avoid big malls like suntec or cbd,btohqsg
Cos exp parking or large place. Difficult to find.,btohqsg
The rest of the malls depends on luck. Even if u can find u need to ensure the food is ready.,btohqsg
Either u do tag team with a partner or u bare the parking if any. But stacking orders will reduce the pain of parking,btohqsg
Why today I never receive my cash out,btohqsg
Hey guys very simple form to fill in for the Esso discount by uparcel,btohqsg

Be very careful when excepting this kind of old chipboard drawers ...this guy book a  MPV but i took the order for $24.50...thought of giving it a miss when i was there but second thought i would have waste my time there so i did the delivery but one bottom piece just fell off during the just for its already swollen and cracked..Now they want compensation ...its like my fault ...,btohqsg
That‚Äôs why I only deliver food,btohqsg
Luckily i predicted that such things will happen so i took a few photos to cover myself ..,btohqsg

My blood boils when I see these sentences. But amazingly still got yao gui took the order! Boycott this & let him do the deliveries himself!,btohqsg
He probably damage the parce before sending haha,btohqsg
That is why hardly anyone picks up SENTOSA haha,btohqsg

But how to do the end trip paperwork?,btohqsg
Like the photo how ah if i do thsi,btohqsg
If user lets you change the sequence  then you just take photo as per normal,btohqsg
If users dun allow.. u have 2 phones.. u use 1 phone take photo n drop as u like then upload the photo later when u reach the drop point according to lalamove arrangement.,btohqsg
Say 3 drops u do 3 2 1 route nv follow 1 2 3.. so when u finish Liao then upload,btohqsg
If user nv specific cannot change  usually I just drop accordingly unless they specify the drop off times for different points hence the route arrangement.,btohqsg
Can amend the next drop in app,btohqsg
guys is this 2 seperate orders?,btohqsg
both have save pick up and drop off location,btohqsg

"That im not sure....i accidentally sent photo to show uploaded doing other orders so its always in the way and live chat.did not help me at all...in the end i put completed just to clear that silly ""order in process""...",btohqsg

Hi bros  just recently joined llm  quick question on average how much we can earn doing courier?,btohqsg

I have been claiming for a cancelled multiple stop order which was cancelled after 2 stops done. From December until now  claimed twice until now no news,btohqsg
Huh. They can do that ah when you already did 2 stop,btohqsg
Like this customer can use this as loophole for free service,btohqsg
Yes.. customer can use any loophole if they wanted to..,btohqsg
And LLM never do anything about it ? Wah.,btohqsg
Ha ha ha... the compensation since September last year till now I haven't received LOL,btohqsg
Their commission they so fast eat.,btohqsg
They say they will submit the complain report,btohqsg
Hi guys  would like to check average how much you all can earn per day for car?,btohqsg
full day say 10 hrs should be btw 150 to 200,btohqsg
Depends on luck. Usually I do weekend can go up to 150 to 200 in 5 to 6 hrs but I have partner tag team.,btohqsg
wah still got partner then how to earn,btohqsg
After deduct his share 200 left 140. Usually travel 100km. That's Ard 25 bucks of petrol,btohqsg
I can tell u not possible,btohqsg
Other then lalamove you guys still got other platforms for car delivery?,btohqsg
The. Judt complete order tk the money,btohqsg
car very hard to stack also. fewer food orders than courier,btohqsg
and parking more difficult and exp,btohqsg
Llm cannot earn lah unless rain then the fare good,btohqsg
Other than that it‚Äôs so pathetic,btohqsg
Yeah go take TDVL or PDVL bettrr,btohqsg
No need to walk up and down some more,btohqsg
I did. But never tell us any more info..,btohqsg
Don even allow us select region‚Ä¶,btohqsg

guys i earn $105 today but i only can cash out $95  why ah? i check suspicious and my jobs done all match $105 but why $10 missing? any idea?,btohqsg
hi  have not used lalamove before. any idea what does it mean by vans driver's help: no additional charge and additional help: +$30?,btohqsg
Not really. Just press and then cancel,btohqsg
If not you won‚Äôt be able to proceed to the next step,btohqsg
Go tally Ur wallet history Vs job.completed,btohqsg
Where to park ah? Carpark abit ex,btohqsg
Ion is a nightmare. I normally avoid orchard üòÖ,btohqsg
Can I know how do I contact customer support?,btohqsg
Do they have any phone numbers?,btohqsg
Does mbs parking have grace period?,btohqsg
They dont give phone. only can contact thru app,btohqsg
Hi this kind how to do? No unit number,btohqsg
Better to call  just say lalamove what's your item. Cos if you go down and they cancel in front of u  which happen before cos they double book and send my items out  you cannot claim compensation. When i tried to claim llm said i didn't call before going so can't.,btohqsg
Hi pls dont bid for this job. Its a loanshark tactic to harrass the family. I went to collect and police was there. Had to wait 1hr to give my statement to IO before I could leave. Waste time.,btohqsg
You go there they ask you do what?,btohqsg
They trying to investigate bec since yesterday a few lalamove drivers keep going to the unit to pick up item. So they want a detailed report from u,btohqsg
Apparently the myanmar helper in that unit borrowed from loanshark. So loanshark using her name and no to order jobs,btohqsg
As long cash orders have to be very careful,btohqsg
8pm can pang kang ready . Night time alot ah long pick,btohqsg
i dont take cash orders specifically cuz of things like this üòÇ,btohqsg
I kanna until no more do night pick,btohqsg
Unless wallet pay u can do lah,btohqsg
This fucker brain got problem lol,btohqsg
I was thinking the same thing  and was wondering if i should post also. Nut job,btohqsg
First day do. 6 hours earn $73 on motorbike. Is it a bit too low?,btohqsg
How the grabs doing? Heard even worse,btohqsg
6hours $73? how many orders u do,btohqsg
Hi all. May I check if do Lalamove by car  is it worth it to do? How is the earnings like?,btohqsg
Only worth if along the way lol,btohqsg
I don't go out of my way to take orders now,btohqsg
Mafan car order  sometimes ppl still ask u bring trolley,btohqsg
These days I usually take courier order lol,btohqsg
How often do the orders come in? And how legit are they? Heard that there alot many fake orders. On average how much money can I make from doing so? I‚Äôm thinking of doing full time  isit viable? Because I don‚Äôt have pdvl,btohqsg
I think full time wanna do delivery with car  go change your insurance to cover commercial and do Foodpanda better üòÇ,btohqsg
How‚Äôs the earnings like btw? Thansk for the help,btohqsg
Maybe some laojiao can come in and advice,btohqsg
I never do fulltime  only do 1-2hr max,btohqsg
N ur car operation cost not low. Tyre  maintenance  petrol,btohqsg
Bros  lalamove apps having issues now is it?,btohqsg
Firstly ask yourself how much you want to earn daily and your operating cost vs actual earning daily.Lalamove have good price only during peak hr when there is many orders or it raining.Most of the time they will courier order first if no taker then change to car order. But how often above happen?During CB phase 2 onwards when Oddle enter Lalamove app. Most of the drivers are earning.Fast forward to November 2022.  when singapore start to open up to overseas tourists.Lalamove have a impact of lack of drivers  because a lot of them return to do PHVThat the time they start to give referrals fee for new drivers and add in schedule surcharge for advance order.End of the days  ask yourself how much you want to earn.If you are renting a car just to do Lalamove.You are better off with a full time job.Just my 2cents worth of advice.,btohqsg
So end of day if renting a car to do Lalamove  is not worth it? How about foodpanda/grabfood any idea about it?,btohqsg
Use motorbike the best if you got,btohqsg
Cycle or bike. If u drive. All these are just supplements. Not for full time.,btohqsg
Honda Civi available for rental from 16 Feb (NON PHV)From$80/day$500/week$1700/month,btohqsg
Ask yourself why you need a car just to do these delivery stuff? Or you need car in your daily errands?,btohqsg
Yes I need car to do daily errands too that‚Äôs why‚Ä¶,btohqsg
A car is a huge liability in sg due to depreciation and cost of fuel,btohqsg
hey guys  do  guys have info about whether Lalamove allow registration of Van without the sticker? Just get MPV jobs is ok..,btohqsg
I guess for van it a must for sticker  best to go down to their office to confirm again,btohqsg
Same thing set a target of daily earning,btohqsg
The thing is finding job to do fulltime vs finding suitable jobs along the way when u use the car is different. Lol,btohqsg
Finding full time it's difficult. Recently not much car jobs. Mostly courier. The distance  parking if any doesn't make sense. It can subsidize ur car rental but u use more petrol,btohqsg
Since u r tryin to look for on the way. Matchin ppl will be easiest,btohqsg
For van  what I know Lalamove must have their sticker pasted on. Mandatory.,btohqsg
Need to confirm this with Lalamove themselves,btohqsg
Emailed them before CNY but no response from them yet üòÖ,btohqsg
I drive van  but last time sticker policy. Unsure about now  might have changed.,btohqsg
But now  the sticker bigger and looks uglier. Too big.,btohqsg
I see today motorcycle also a lot flower delivery. 52L motorcycle box can fit the entire bouquet inside? I scare accept liao then cannot take,btohqsg
Can la  unless the bouquet is those 100 rose kind then cannot lol,btohqsg
Mine when I put my deposit  i still couldn't take any jobs. Mandatory to put sticker for van. And yes the sticker is freaking ugly üòÇ,btohqsg
I was planning to get a van for my company with my company decal,btohqsg
now  I receive $25 / month for sticker advertisement.,btohqsg

The valentine project how ah? Until now no call nothing. Anyone got get contacted for the project?,btohqsg
If credit ok. Ho there too big cannot fit ask for compensation from agent,btohqsg
Go by stops doesn‚Äôt count as incentives right bros?,btohqsg
hi hi anyone collected the Esso fuel card? do we earn smile points or card is just for discount?,btohqsg
Anyone know for the valentine day project  after we complete can go for another project or only 1 time?,btohqsg
Saman guy come already at goodwood florist.. who park vehicles outside road better come faster..,btohqsg
I collected yesterday. You need to download the Esso app and key in the card number LLM gave you. You can still earn smiles points,btohqsg
Just maybe  there is a reason why the price for bike is soo low,btohqsg
from user interface  an example of this trip. is shown as 24Km for Car,btohqsg
However for bike  it is only 18KM.,btohqsg
I cross reference to Van.. it is also showing as 24 KM,btohqsg
Honestly van there's no milage fee so want compare is to courier le.,btohqsg
distance aside  need to consider the package size also. car/van can fit more things. hence the fare is higher,btohqsg
Google Map Bicycle show as 18KM,btohqsg
So the quote for courier follow bicycle,btohqsg
Technically shortchange $2.20 (not inclusive surge) for this trip for motorcycle,btohqsg
By the way what is the expectation for time frame for delivery? The app got show what time to collect only,btohqsg
I always collect and deliver right away then accept another job,btohqsg
i think i should collect a few then take my own sweet time to deliver. Can earn more,btohqsg
1h grace period by right. But some customer is fine with you delivering 2h max.,btohqsg
Walk in to collect or they send you sms?,btohqsg
it depends on the order / customer. 1 Hour time frame - your limit.,btohqsg
If exceed 1 hour  app will auto penalize you or as long customers dont complain means ok,btohqsg
If over 1 hour pray that customer don complain can le.,btohqsg
I ask the poc. No more,btohqsg
Just on the app rate is better than their so call ‚Äúproj‚Äù,btohqsg

hi guys  first time doing lalamove i‚Äôve accepted a cash order so do i take cash when i go pick up the order?,btohqsg
Depends on the customer  which payment method they prefer,btohqsg
Nowadays  PayNow / PayLah or cash when items delivered.,btohqsg
so i have to complete the job first then collect payment from the customer,btohqsg
Depends. Sometimes the pickup point the owner will pay u already.,btohqsg
Do anyone know how lalamove count?System show:From jalan buroh to changi south street 1  about 39km1.7m vanDelivery fee $39.20I tot was 1.7m van base fare $30 + (39km x $0.50: $19.50) : $49.50$10.3 missing,btohqsg

"Difficult to say. I ever got this order customer stated in the notes do not ring the bell. When I arrived at the customer address which is a condo  I intercom and then the customer did not grant me access to the lift and shouted over the intercom to ask me wait downstairs. When the customer came down he shouted ""are you stupid or blind I stated do not ring the bell"" straightaway I ask the customer back does this intercom looks like a bell to you",btohqsg

Hi all Just want ask how about the customer didn't pay once rider completed the order..CS just replied they will investigate first..Did anyone face this issue before?,btohqsg

Jeez cancel aso no noti one,btohqsg
That's why I left my app on see until pop up...,btohqsg
happen to me a few times already with paynow never pay immediately. esp that time vday.. 2 different florist say busy  later will pay.. so what to do I just continue lox.. if hold the item until they pay I will waste alot of time. but they did pay a long while later at night without me asking again.I got another time - multi trip delivery after all delivery completed i cannot contact the main customer. never answer phone. I report to lalamove they say they will investigate. a few hours later the customer call me back say lalamove contact him and sorry he fell asleep. the vday ones I not so scared because its a company. but this was a private individual i was really scared i don't get money.. some more this was many stops alot of money. lucky in the end ok.but I wonder if the customer just don't pay  will lalamove compensate us?,btohqsg
I'm not sure how to get back my pay...Maybe unable to get back üòÖüòÖüòÖI don't think LLM will pay,btohqsg

Guys de price for 2.4m van i saw had been reduce fr $38 to $32 base price.....isit permanent?,btohqsg
Those who do full time how ah,btohqsg
My honest opinion Bro  if you wanna stack. You must be aware that there are risks. So if customer complain  bo pian have to bite the bullet. Honestly when I stack also  I‚Äôm aware of the gamble and pray that they don‚Äôt complain. ü´§I feel your pain  but we know that LLM is customer oriented. Which means customers‚Äô always come first. 90% we ‚Äúappeal‚Äù likely not to be heard.We can never find the fine prints of their ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù against drivers coz we are always at LLM mercy. üòî,btohqsg
Those doing full time slog 12-14 hours on the road just to make ends meet from rental  petrol and parking charges.Some of the LLM whom shared their experiences with me along the way will likely slog it out.,btohqsg
my first day of llm alrdy kena complaint  i gg alrdy,btohqsg
As the saying goes. Want to do anything also can   dun get caught. If kena then just accept it and move on.,btohqsg
I think oodle orders auto investigate for all late orders kne,btohqsg
It‚Äôs damn ridiculous nonetheless. At least Pickupp is upfront about their late penalty as to how many percents they deduct.,btohqsg
Deducting more than what the order pays is bullying,btohqsg
Lol. That's when they pay you for waiting for the order.But when the requestor wait for you is a different story. Sometimes they have to refund even up to 50% of what customer pay + compensation of customer's items (especially if is perishable),btohqsg
Hi i‚Äôm new to lalamove. can i check what‚Äôs the easiest way to do back to back like grab system etc,btohqsg
I only started for a few months too. But I realise stacking can be a bit hard on Lalamove due to the 1-hour restriction.Two scenarios I will stack:1. When the two orders are both same/very near to each other both in pick up and drop off point. (Doesn‚Äôt happen often but they do.)2. I tend to check for new orders when I‚Äôm nearing the drop off location (5-10min away). So if there‚Äôs one pick up that‚Äôs super near the first drop off  I can decide if I should pick up the order first (without risking being late for the first drop off) or pick up the order soon after I drop off (without being too late for it i.e. 20min to pick up),btohqsg
Also there are clients who are clear that they don‚Äôt need us to meet the 1 hour KPI. I‚Äôve clients who explicitly tell me that  e.g. ‚Äúyou can take your time as long as you send before 10pm‚Äù,btohqsg
I agree. What I tend to do is call and check with customer. Most of the time   they are flexible with timing as long as you check with them.,btohqsg
Yeah. There are many nice and reasonable clients among the some self-entitled ones. Sometimes we may not have the energy to talk too much to them  but I do realise good customer servicing like talking to them nicely usually can in turn benefit us sometimes.,btohqsg
Yup. I dun even call  them. Just whatsapp. Besides   that chat log will also serve as proof should customer twist  the story against you.,btohqsg
Oh one more thing: Oodle orders will write the time it is to be delivered  so be very careful when you take them. Quite a few times I know I can‚Äôt reach on time  I will make sure to let the client know and collect evidence to keep e.g. screenshot of GPS that shows ETA  photo that you‚Äôre at the pick up location (that you‚Äôre not late)  etc,btohqsg
It helps also to put ‚Äúarrive‚Äù the moment u reach the location before the doorstep. I mean technically that‚Äôs not wrong right ü§™,btohqsg
