Can try melatonin  any brand should be ok. But I personally tried natrol before from iherb,btohqsg
Good to start with 3 MG first. See if your body can a not.If not tomorrow morning after taking will feel sluggish and groggy,btohqsg
Plus in my opinion  if you need strong er  just take one more = 6mg total. So you can adjust accordingly. Whereas if you buy straightaway 10mg  cannot reduce,btohqsg
Yeah I usually take a bout 1 hour before bedtime then slowly will take effect.Most important is don't take with full stomach. Cos the food will slow down the effect,btohqsg
I‚Äôm taking the Olly. Works for a while.,btohqsg
The effect will goes off after a while. At least for me.,btohqsg
