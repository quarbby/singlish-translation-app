Coming from someone who took Econs in JC 22 years ago  I can safely say that basic Econs knowledge is really super useful in life. Basic Econs + basic accounting knowledge from taking a module in Uni... bestBut ok  not a fair comparison as I stop Georg after S2.,btohqsg
Geog rly isn't as bad as ppl say it is,btohqsg
scoring for it  and real world application of it  is different,btohqsg
Study for Georg  study for Econs  have very big difference in being able to score?,btohqsg
