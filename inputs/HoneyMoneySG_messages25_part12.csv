Yes. I know the limitations of frank card  but I'm using the card for iPayMy anyway. If I use it only for iPayMy  I get 3.125%. But if I mix in some Forex spend  the net returns will definitely be higher  and I also get some additional cashback for forex spends. Just wondering what is the penalty for forex spend in this case  and if this use case beats using amaze or revolut.,btohqsg
Please note that SingSaver HSBC CC promo T&Cs says $800 spending by end of the following mth  while the SingSaver email says with 30 days of approval to qualify for rewards. Quite different  so which is correct? I'm assuming the T&Cs.,btohqsg

does anyone know Lazada Gift Card is Quasi or something else ? and does it give 4mpd for CRMC,btohqsg
is there any method to withdraw credit card top up money from grab pay?,btohqsg
I don't think there is such way to withdraw 100%. Of coz if u use it to pay for something and indirectly withdraw as cash  it's possible. But definitely will have a % fee charged,btohqsg
you dont earn the 10x pt anymore  so all transaction after $1000 is 1 pt only or 0.4 mpd if im not wrong,btohqsg
i find a way: wise  but it will cost more than 2% fee.ðŸ¥¶,btohqsg
So GXS only worth putting 5k inside?,btohqsg
If I use amaze but my CRMC is linked same 4mpd?,btohqsg
Should I do VCMA in January?,btohqsg

Hello guys  do you guys know if paying for Airbnb and splitting the payment into 2  (reservation  final payment) still counts for the 4mpd using HSBC revolution? Or do they require a one time full payment to count?,btohqsg
Does HSBC revolution get 10x if used as linked payment method on shopback pay or favepay?,btohqsg
How does the HSBC EGA works?To qualify for the rewards is it a 1 shot $5000 transfer per month? Or I can do a transfer in and transfer out to total up to $5000?,btohqsg
as long itâ€™s online transaction & in the qualifying category u will earn 4mpd,btohqsg
still count. You just get points due for amount paid for first and then final payment. That is what I saw in my split airbnb payment,btohqsg
Hi  if i hold a Amex CB *sub* card  am i still considered NTB and qualifty for sign up gift if i decide to sign up on my own as main account holder? Thanks in advance!,btohqsg
I can't spend another $500 for yuuBecause i already signed for citi rewardsðŸ˜… they also need $500 min spendI guess i can't sign up for the dbs world women's card..Is there another option?Dbs altitude ?,btohqsg
Can I check if anyone received hsbc physical card already?,btohqsg
Buy ntuc voucher also count as min spending,btohqsg
I don't do grocery shopping much.. the yuu categories don't really suit my spending areaðŸ«¥,btohqsg
I think dbs altitude is a good option for hotel and airline spend. Dbs altitude can earn 3mpd. If book through Expedia then it is 6mpd.Citi premiermiles also has some limited time promos for travel spend and can tag to amaze since its a mastercard.Miles earned in either card have no expiry date,btohqsg
No min spend for these 2 cards,btohqsg
Hi just wondering is there any cash back cards for overseas hotel?Or does citi rewards card give 4 mile per dollar on overseas hotel booking?Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Don't use Citi Rewards  you'll only get 0.4 mpd.You can use the following:- HSBC Revolution (online or contactless) for 4 mpd or 2.5% cashback- OCBC 365 for 3% cashback- DBS WWMC (online booking) for 4 mpd- UOB Lady's (travel as 10X category) for 4 mpd,btohqsg
I wish to check has anyone tried using CRMC to book hotel via shopee? Does the mcc code in this case allow 10x reward points?,btohqsg
Shopee has a hotel booking portal?,btohqsg
Not sure on the mcc code will reflect as what..,btohqsg
Which do u recommend?Is there any new sign up gifts for HSBC Revolution? As I see alot of people is recommending it,btohqsg
Does anyone know how come I didnâ€™t get 10x points when I used hsbc revo via applepay at Zara. Retail stores included in their whitelist right?,btohqsg
GXS got cutoff for salary in order to get qualify? approval not instant for me,btohqsg
Bonus points will be credited in the following month,btohqsg
I forgot that you can also consider Uob Lady's card 4mpd for travel category  no min spend  for ladies only,btohqsg
I'm seeing a lot of msgs about gxs  is it legit? And invite only?,btohqsg
Yes it is legit and invite only. But I see little use of it when compared to UOB 1 or OCBC 360 account.,btohqsg
When TCB amex & uob amex nerf from grab,btohqsg
But you don't have to hit certain criterias to earn with it  maybe easier for less hassle?,btohqsg
Oh so it doesnâ€™t show immediately like crmc?,btohqsg
But how do you get invited?,btohqsg
Nope  you will see it in the next month's statement,btohqsg
7th business day of the month. Most likely tomorrow,btohqsg
Yes you are correct about the no criteria part. But sadly  the saving pocket is capped at 5k max for now. So in terms of a saving account  you cant get as much interest generate from a 5k deposit.,btohqsg
Hello  does anyone know when will uob cashback be credited? I can't seem to get cashback despite hitting all the criteria,btohqsg
