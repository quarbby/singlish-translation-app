Kai YangDo not advertise your group in my group.,btohqsg
is T Bill yield always higher than SSB for same month ?,btohqsg
Hi anyone manage to receive tax refund on their YouTrip card before?,btohqsg
I just applied for amaze card after watching Chris' YouTube. But I m concern about using the card in JB as there's a lot feedback that there's issue on petrol and retail purchase. I planned to pair with Citi+ card for cashback.,btohqsg
T bill is the leading indicator for SSB to a certain extend... so if interest rates dropping it will be lower... and vice versa,btohqsg
what about the standard chartered smart credit card? that gives 6% or 5 mpd  seems decent. Or you can‚Äôt apply for that too?,btohqsg
i hope not‚Ä¶ then no more gateway for amex which is a huge nerf on the absolut amex itself since almost no one in singapore accepts it,btohqsg
Bobian lo better than using grab I suppose üòÇ,btohqsg
If u have revolut u can try the hack tooUob amex>grab>revolut,btohqsg
Now I think about it actually could have stuck to Revolut tho no Cashback (earn via Amex > Grab > Revo),btohqsg
wouldn‚Äôt then just using regular 1.2mpd card be more valuable?,btohqsg
I think it have to do with the amount you are trying to top up. Just tried 10 dollar to youtrip from grab  it work,btohqsg
Don't have altitude (Citi PM excludes it)HSBC Revo earns .. 0.4 mpd,btohqsg
I heard cashing out will be a problem if top up this way tho so be careful,btohqsg
Large amount get rejected which is why have to play around with the amount to see which amount goes through for grab to revolut or grab to youtrip,btohqsg
I dont cash out often  i use for touch and go app to pay in malaysia,btohqsg
Revolut rate for ringgit is better then youtrip,btohqsg
citi premiermiles doesnt work for simplygo?,btohqsg
Tried again with $10  same issue. Maybe blacklisted haha,btohqsg
citibank exclude simplygo on all cards except citi smrt,btohqsg
Nope  excluded in Citi master list,btohqsg
oh that sucks‚Ä¶ ill need a solution after sc ends their promotion too then..,btohqsg
Uob>grab> revolut will get rejected at time if the top up amount is too big  tried 1k unsucessful but 500 went through. Need to top up on different day,btohqsg
Was it paynow qr or by card?,btohqsg
i recently did the same top up method to buy some yen on revolut  topped up about 500 and it worked,btohqsg
Youtrip should be same issue  should be grab side rejecting the transaction,btohqsg
Hah ya the last nail to the coffins,btohqsg

Uob amex itself still have it's advantage for site that accept amex. It is 1.7 cashback highest among cashback card with the least exclusion,btohqsg
Goverment website take amex  hospital take amex,btohqsg
This is my hospital bill card to go to,btohqsg
the painful one is insurance premiums,btohqsg
AIA refuses to take anything except mastercard,btohqsg
That is because mastercard might be the cheapest among the card type,btohqsg
Visa fee is not cheap for merchant,btohqsg
yea i heard that too  and amex being the most exp,btohqsg
But visa card give more benefit,btohqsg
Look at almost cashback card is visa network,btohqsg
which is the only advantage that grab mastercard has now  acting as the proxy ü•≤ just hoping uob doesnt exclude grab,btohqsg
It is a co relationship  uob nees grab grad need uob,btohqsg
Data can show uob what most user use uob amex on,btohqsg
hopefully  my heart is still trying to recover from the dbs nerf of instarem!,btohqsg
If uov amex nerf the grab  top up then time to move o.,btohqsg
Instarem might be nerf with other bank sooner or later  we shall see,btohqsg
I also looking at a replacmen,btohqsg
please share if you find any! üòÜ,btohqsg
It really depend on individual spending habit to know which card suit,btohqsg
