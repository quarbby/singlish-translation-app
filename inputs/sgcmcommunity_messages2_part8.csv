@yoshi_ethlooks like you need to get that 320i,btohqsg
Haha. The s5 on your ig story looks more tempting üòÇ,btohqsg
Lets go car shopping with sgcarmart.Have u guys thought of doing review on owner‚Äôs car/thoughts of the car,btohqsg
I mean viewers like me wld also like to know what are the pros n cons of whichever car via owner‚Äôs pov.Are sgcarmart reviews biased n sponsored in anyway? Only saying the good stuffs? Lol,btohqsg
We can assure you that our reviews are not biased. We say it as it is,btohqsg
For used car reviews  that's kind of tricky. What if we identify a problem with the used car?But we'll certainly take your feedback into consideration and let Julian and Jon know.,btohqsg
only 600+ members here la but can ask if there is a particular model you are thinking of.. i pm my review to one here,btohqsg
It's only going to grow bigger. Big plans!,btohqsg
Also I was thinking if the car reviews can be comparing cars in each class rather than individual cars so that people can know what choices are available rather than just knowing mostly about the particular car. I think it would be more useful as in one video people can know about the best few cars in the segment rather than just one individual car,btohqsg

Haha. Thats where the sgcm warranty comes in.. i saw some of the listing in sgcm has that?,btohqsg
Yeah. That would make a sound choice for car buyers. Like me i wanna know like example a golf  what cars are in the same range (price  space  power at least)And then a comparison on whats better so we can make a better choice in our future selection.Its gonna be tough as u guys will need to do more homework and also review them together or edit it together,btohqsg
"Yes. Some of our used car dealers pick up the warranty  and some don't. That's why you see some listings with ""This car is covered under sgCarMart Warranty"".",btohqsg
Sounds interesting. But once again  we will have to bring this up to Julian and Jon,btohqsg
@yoshi_ethwe will unpin the poll later on k? Don't worry!,btohqsg

Can someone suggest where to buy racing seats ?,btohqsg
Yeah  if Toyota brought over sgcarmart  would there be a conflict of interest when reviewing Toyota products?,btohqsg
Hi all I am new here   any tips for grooming chemicals shop,btohqsg
We understand that you might feel that there might be some 'conflict of interests'  but we assure you that there is none. sgCarMart will continue to operate as an independent entity with no change to our business model.We will remain brand neutral and maintain the status quo with no change to how we operated previously under Singapore Press Holdings (SPH).,btohqsg
Later review out only Toyota good the rest not good,btohqsg
We will remain impartial in all our reviews do not worry,btohqsg
Hi all. Not sure if I can ask this here but if I‚Äôm buying a used car from a dealer (gst registered)  the gst should already be included in the car price right?,btohqsg
Thx for the reply! Coz dealer wants me to pay gst and when questioned  he says his car price not inclusive of gst. But he‚Äôs willing to half-half the gst with me and absorb a lil bit more.,btohqsg
https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/goods-services-tax-(gst)/basics-of-gst/invoicing-price-display-and-record-keeping/displaying-and-quoting-prices#:~:text=GST%2Dregistered%20businesses%20must%20display as%20the%20GST%2Dexclusive%20price. GST-registered businesses must display and quote prices inclusive of GST. If both GST-inclusive and GST-exclusive prices are displayed  the GST-inclusive price must be displayed at least as prominently as the GST-exclusive price.,btohqsg
not quoting inclusive GST is 100% unethical and possibly illegal. To me  he is just trying to squeeze more money from you. If I was you  immediate blacklist and go patronise someone else,btohqsg
Thank you so much sir  much appreciated üôèüèª,btohqsg
Also  admin fee is another BS right? üòÇ,btohqsg
pretty much. Anything 'extra' after price agreed is immediate red flag and if its me i walk away,btohqsg
Which dealer gave that BS on the gst?,btohqsg
i have no problem with admin fee if its pre-agreed before setting final price,btohqsg
its those last minute additions i have problem with. they use all sorts of names for these BS charges,btohqsg
To be fair  it wasn‚Äôt really last minute additions. We were still in the midst of negotiations,btohqsg
Normally when negotiating the price  I will upfront tell him to tell I want the all in price. Whatever gst  admin fee you can charge whatever you want  just tell me the all in price.,btohqsg
If car price is 50k  I expect 50k inclusive of whatever fee you want to charge. Maybe car $1k  admin 49k.,btohqsg
Yea  guess the negotiations continue hahaha,btohqsg
Appreciate all the replies here  thx all!,btohqsg
Ask to waive the admin fee. Sounds bullshit,btohqsg
