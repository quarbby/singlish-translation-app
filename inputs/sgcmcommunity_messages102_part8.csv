But you still haven't told us what it is,btohqsg
i always thought  skyactiv is considered as mild hybrid  just like bmw efficient dynamics,btohqsg
/reportmy rickshaw rider brain is unable to comprehend,btohqsg
mild as in there is no motor,btohqsg
There is also skyactiv mild hybrid  which is from 2018,btohqsg
Skyactiv only good for start stop,btohqsg
Skyactiv is just the chasis rite,btohqsg
The mild hybrid also powered moving off,btohqsg
Like the design of the chasis,btohqsg

Ever so slightly on the Mazda 3,btohqsg
welp  just buy the car for the good interior then,btohqsg
It's a whole thing with chassis  body and engine,btohqsg
But not all cars with the skyactiv badge get the chassis and body,btohqsg
I know the cx 8 only get the chasis,btohqsg
Alamak .. I read wrongly I tot . X5M ðŸ¤£,btohqsg

The skyactiv engine primarily works on the air fuel mixture and compression ratio to make sure there's better utilization of all fuel and less unburnt fuel,btohqsg

If you look at the innuendos,btohqsg
But that's all Disney movies in general,btohqsg
Waiting for them to show Sleepy Beauty real story,btohqsg
Sleeping Beauty is based on a story wherea married king finds a girl asleep and can't wake her  so rap es her instead. The story is called The Sun  the Moon  and Talia  written  or at the least collected and composed  by the Italian poet Giambattista Basile.,btohqsg
