Let X the no of heartbeats in 1 minute. Then X is a Poisson random variable.,btohqsg
Its apparently just a global parameter,btohqsg
Which makes it poor because they dont have a solid way to determine λ value,btohqsg
Or at least i cant find it in the paper,btohqsg
Wtf are we flexxing in chat group now,btohqsg
Basically  the healthier you are  the lower your heart rate,btohqsg
Yeah and idt it requires any maths to reach that conclusion,btohqsg
Clearly your definition of mathematics is too narrow,btohqsg
Which isnt required on day to day basis,btohqsg
To a lower limit  of course,btohqsg
I dont see a reason for math to exist ofher than to be a hidden layer and weights in a computer,btohqsg
That’s a pretty good reason to exist,btohqsg
Imagine needing maths to calculate calories,btohqsg
wtf you never cite the Nature Deep Learning paper,btohqsg
anyone planning to EAE to Poly ?,btohqsg
I think those planning to EAE are sleeping,btohqsg
Mcm   but kinda conflicted btw poly & jc... reading some articles too,btohqsg
What course do u want to pursue in uni,btohqsg
In certain industries  hands on experience is preferred more than theoretical understanding. In such fields  a poly to uni route is more valuable than a JC to uni route.,btohqsg
haha nice i applied there last year,btohqsg
not sure honestly  if I were to continue in the comm side it’ll be comm studies in wee kim wee/ba in comm suss,btohqsg
Did you get in there ?,btohqsg
50% of the intake is eae,btohqsg
Oh damn so where are you in now ?,btohqsg
only realised it didnt fit me during the interview haha,btohqsg
i asked the lecturer how close mcm was to a journalism sch,btohqsg
and then she gave me a weird look and started going on about how it was more on advertising and pr as well,btohqsg
and i didnt rly wan to do marketing so i noped outta theree,btohqsg
Honestly not sure on what I wanna do in future.  I have a knack for hosting programmes in school but not sure if something I enjoy to do can be something I can pursue as a career. Kinda wrecking my head since EAE is coming up and I had my eyes on MCM since Sec 2 until recently when I started having questions about what I mentioned above and whether job security would be there. Plus I wish to earn a decent salary as well. Some say go to JC is you are nt sure what to do. Here in Sec school I’m kinda struggling in A-Math and not sure if I should go JC.,btohqsg
Oh damn very brave of you !,btohqsg
Moreover I wish to also enter Uni and get a degree too...so I’m really conflicted at this point haha,btohqsg
Anyone out there who shared the same sentiments please do hmu yea ! Could really use some help,btohqsg
tbh u should just go for it and try first,btohqsg
unis nowadays also accepting more poly kids anyways so idt the stereotype is very true today,btohqsg
and everyone fails at amaths haha i was failing all the way until olvls,btohqsg
Wheres my 2:48 am gang at,btohqsg
Hello it is actually 2:50 am,btohqsg
No havent heard back from any uni yet,btohqsg
Still got time till 24th may,btohqsg
Even KB didnt get a course yet,btohqsg
Not sure if that's a relief or a disaster HAHHA,btohqsg
Pretty sure kb applies for cs didnt he,btohqsg
Relief hahaha it means ntu fucking slow,btohqsg
Afaik that's the impression I got of him,btohqsg
Not sure what kind of subjects he likes,btohqsg
Have u seen his ABA personal statement,btohqsg
My bunk fucking burst laughing i tell u,btohqsg
Uh obv not HAHA I dont even talk to him,btohqsg
Its like ur interview but worst and in written form,btohqsg
Why do I feel like I'm a source of ridicule,btohqsg
Came from when his senior helped him buy and build computer,btohqsg
HAHAHAHA wah shit okay I shouldnt be laughing,btohqsg
But I'm sure he can go to most other courses he have in mind,btohqsg
His second choice confirm get in one,btohqsg
But the thing is still avnt gotten offer yet,btohqsg
Ah okay I was getting worried when my first interview took place a little over a month ago now and still no reply,btohqsg
Butchered that interview but thought I'd at least get a rejection letter or something soon,btohqsg
Interview doesnt amount to much in singapore unless its a competitive course,btohqsg
Well you say that but I'm still not getting an offer -3-,btohqsg
But alright I'll keep my hopes up for another 11 days,btohqsg
I still need to decide on a course,btohqsg
I thought you decided on bme,btohqsg
But now i feel other courses are much better,btohqsg
Head nurse sharma $12k a month sounds quite good to me,btohqsg
HAHHAHAHA idk why I laughed at that,btohqsg
Sign me up wtf next year time to apply nus nursing,btohqsg
If I ever have to come to that point,btohqsg
Do you not need to wake up and report attendance in the morning ._.,btohqsg
When was the last time u heard of me sleeping,btohqsg
I must have a weird fetish if I were to track your sleeping schedule,btohqsg

Online reports say that people in east side starting to go back up,btohqsg

PepeFeet $100 thanks transfer me paynow,btohqsg
How may I acquire a Pepe plushy,btohqsg
Apparently the one i have is a claw machine prize,btohqsg
My senior send me a uni course,btohqsg
3year study life science in NUS,btohqsg
3year study Veterinary medicine in Melbourne,btohqsg
I will be in NS 18-20,btohqsg
26-27 year old but the time I come out,btohqsg
If I study med in SG  I can defer and study from 19-23  than about one year of NS,btohqsg
Do Singapore even need vet hahahah,btohqsg
Really meh  i thought they need more doctor,btohqsg
Lol its what you want do,btohqsg
And whether you have the resources to do it,btohqsg
Go research on job opportunities for vets,btohqsg
Medicine year I guess can defer and if you're in saf you'll be promoted to LTA at least so it's decent choice,btohqsg
They can don't defer you but quite likely they will,btohqsg
senior status means he grad from undergrad le doing 2nd degree,btohqsg
Why should we donate to him? He looks smart,btohqsg
i where got say donate to him,btohqsg
Grad from undergrad can find job can earn money but ask other ppl for money for luxury items when beggars can't have food,btohqsg
good for him he just made real beggars look like a joke,btohqsg
u have no idea how much singaporeans care about their pets,btohqsg
Like the most renowned pet shops i went to before,btohqsg
They only scraping by with $3-$4k a month,btohqsg
but is okay u r known to not change ur view points so idw to get into an argument which will lead no where haha,btohqsg
the pet shops are not clinics- -,btohqsg
When i still had a dog,btohqsg
"thats why im clarifying how much u meant by ""fucking"" profitable",btohqsg
vet shops generally dont have in-house doctors,btohqsg
Nus life science will increase intake for DvM,btohqsg
Definitely more demand than TCM  but not as good as studying med,btohqsg
from what i know its about 5-7kish,btohqsg
for fresh grad or 10 years after grad?,btohqsg
certainly not after 10 years but certainly not fresh grad either,btohqsg
so maybe 5 years after grad har i assume,btohqsg
Ello what are we talking about today? :),btohqsg
btw the most profitable careers ive seen make 150k first year,btohqsg
But if i study that hard to earn that much  i rather do something else,btohqsg
so i must make sure ive my expectations set straight on how much fucking profitable is,btohqsg
we talking about pure income ma,btohqsg
They earn abt the same as a test tube washer,btohqsg
Unless they open their own shop and have a large loyal customer base,btohqsg
there  this is finance all over gain no?,btohqsg
u think how VC/PE/growth equity works,btohqsg
Guys  what's the point for a bachelor degree with honours,btohqsg
Finance u earn a lot when u young  get retrenched earlyEntrepeneurship u can retire when u want if successful,btohqsg
Just open more doors i guess,btohqsg
Common saying in the banking industry,btohqsg
Imagine if this was posted by some white middle class guy,btohqsg
Finance in certain areas maybe not,btohqsg
banking is not the entire finance industry tho,btohqsg
without them i would say alot of entrepreneurs would die,btohqsg
private equity venture capital growth equity,btohqsg
without blackstone half of new york working population have no place to live,btohqsg
other than banking the finance industry is comparable in terms of stability to other careers,btohqsg
is Honours is just the last year u do internship and research?,btohqsg
banking is known to be xibei xiong thats true,btohqsg
if you like IT stuff can go into financial crime stuff also,btohqsg
Honours can just be research only/specialisation yr,btohqsg
Internship can be done in other yrs,btohqsg
this one at least need masters tho,btohqsg
cryptography is some very difficult math,btohqsg
probably will have a bounty on your head hahaha,btohqsg
ya but need specialist knowledge and at least a master,btohqsg
i tot most degrees in sg auto honors,btohqsg
non honors will be a huge disadvantage meh,btohqsg
i tot its just one line in cv,btohqsg
thats why some ppl study 3 yrs for some courses (excluding NTU NBS),btohqsg
"isnt that why i say ""most""",btohqsg
ye true then if u specify 4 yrs,btohqsg
otherwise most degrees dont rly give honours to all,btohqsg
those with honors behind are those that can choose not to do honors,btohqsg
"and look at proportion seems that im right with the ""most"" qualifier",btohqsg
NUS Website is in need of a spring cleaning,btohqsg
This website says DDP DHP cs + math requires 208 MCs,btohqsg
this website also gives a link for single honours DDP for cs + math,btohqsg
But the link goes to this which is for a double honours program,btohqsg
"holy fuck do I need to email them just to ask ""sorry ah how many MCs I need take ah uwu""",btohqsg
Such good website  reflecting very well on the school of computing aint it,btohqsg
I mean looking at the solutions the prof gives and the recent exam results,btohqsg
Math and computing have huge overlap horh,btohqsg
That's cos I'm not doing it,btohqsg
I mean like the shitty website  reflects bad on their own IT team  and yet they wanna teach computing. I know it’s not the same I’m just being snarky.,btohqsg
The entire NUS site is trash,btohqsg
been in the sch for 2 years didnt know lol,btohqsg
They dont teach optimisation in computing sadly,btohqsg
i was gonna declare cs minor next sem,btohqsg
only good for grooming future sexual predators,btohqsg
then why the fk am i still virgin after so long,btohqsg
It’s one thing to not update the site regularly  it’s another to not put a “Last Updated:” on their site  at least when there are conflicting info  ppl know which one more recent.,btohqsg
You’re either the predator or the prey.,btohqsg
U need to wait to be predated on,btohqsg
but the predators wouldnt be virgins too,btohqsg
Bold of u to assume that. John is a birgin,btohqsg
The concept of virginity doesn’t apply to John,btohqsg
This is actually a valid conclusion,btohqsg
Joke explanation...: I’m implying he’s the prey  because if he’s a predator he’ll lose it by now.,btohqsg
Anyone knows the the benefit of advance placement credit,btohqsg
Can be exempted from that mod lorh,btohqsg
No need to take that mod,btohqsg
So if I take the advance placement means I have lesser module,btohqsg
But the apc test is notoriously hard,btohqsg
You need to calm down im using android 😔😔😔,btohqsg
Did anyone of y'all try taking it?,btohqsg
Apple > whatever the fk nokia runs on > android,btohqsg
U can see sample papers online,btohqsg
no its apple > samsung > oppo > huawei > nokia,btohqsg
I’m pretty sure u can only take the test once u enter,btohqsg
All your > should be <,btohqsg
But may as well try to get those advanced placements,btohqsg
Is worth only if they complements,btohqsg
But that's is BA in Art,btohqsg
So what's your rationale for taking psychology,btohqsg
Can't be your girlfriend taking it then you take right,btohqsg
woah mw has a gf :o,btohqsg
Go double deg comb bio and cs,btohqsg
Can u even do comp bio and cs,btohqsg
But can also do a double degree right,btohqsg
Is like saying i want do cs+IS,btohqsg
Lol I thought this was xd,btohqsg
I think u can take any DDP combination in NUS?,btohqsg
So double Degree or double major if want to do life science plus psychology ah,btohqsg
@junghon3709I need ur wisdom and wise opinion Mr Jung hon,btohqsg
Maybe someone can explain. I am suddenly experiencing frequent lack of words to express myself,btohqsg
But if u love wat u do,btohqsg
Double degree is even more right,btohqsg
Double major is you get one piece of paper with two majors on it,btohqsg
Double degree is you get two pieces of paper  each with one major,btohqsg
What if I did a double degree each with a second major and a minor,btohqsg
I read it as double masters,btohqsg
For people who are too free,btohqsg
Sorry I too dum dum liao,btohqsg
Its like acertainparticular JC but one more year,btohqsg
Damn didnt know u can predict elon musks irrational behaviours and implication on the stocks,btohqsg
I thought it meant key nationwide non-essential businesses complete circuit breaker,btohqsg
Didn't know CS1101S was worth 4 MCs,btohqsg
Isn't CS1101S supposed to be 5,btohqsg
maybe I'm looking at old courses,btohqsg
All cs1101s before 2018 are worth 5 MCs,btohqsg
Not sure why they would have a CS1101s compared to a CS1010 then,btohqsg
Tbh I wanna take CS1101S if it's offered during special term,btohqsg
But I doubt it will be,btohqsg
only 1010e is offered in special term,btohqsg
is it the star wars theme thing,btohqsg
anyway now u also cant choose,btohqsg
wow nus rag is still going on,btohqsg
but they are not cancelling it,btohqsg
the extra 1mc is for 1010R,btohqsg

Elon Musk gonna get arrested  quick  buy TSLA calls  literally cannot go tits up,btohqsg
Why is he gonna get arrested?,btohqsg
He just protested the lockdown from what I heard,btohqsg
He opened his factory against state regulations,btohqsg
I thought it was becus of the baby at first,btohqsg
We all thought Elon Musk was cool  now we know he's just a giant baby with lots of money,btohqsg
he also has a baby with an odd name,btohqsg
If we buy his stocks now what will happen,btohqsg
Will we gain or lose money,btohqsg
Thought will gain money and wanted someone to buy for me,btohqsg
Do u save that name in ur phone,btohqsg
He was bullied at school and became a billionaire so he purposefully named his child that way to get bullied in school so he can become a billionaire,btohqsg
Or he gonna send his baby to Mars,btohqsg
The kid clearly belongs on Olympus Mons,btohqsg

No one sells a laptop without an OS,btohqsg
I intern at AStar last year than they gave me an email from AStar  and the email has the Microsoft product lisence for up to 5 device.,btohqsg

Tune in to some 'meh' chinese rap,btohqsg
I'm listening to old Jay Chou songs again,btohqsg
fei yuqing collab is the best,btohqsg
ai zai xi yuan qian is the best,btohqsg
Isn't that just a pitch  with you as the product,btohqsg
It is a reward meant only for the privileged,btohqsg
As in I search for Jay Chou these are in my list la,btohqsg
including the one he compose for others isit,btohqsg
jay chou got 260 songs meh,btohqsg
i listen to jay chou for so many years also dont remember he got 260 songs,btohqsg

He got 800 plus songs sia,btohqsg

I watched at least 15 times,btohqsg
The freaking time travel plot still very genius,btohqsg

Low key just want people to follow you,btohqsg
Y u reveal my true intentions,btohqsg
Nowadays I never listen to new songs other than from JJ Stefanie Jay le,btohqsg
Idk why but nowadays i prefer those small band songs over those popular singers for chinese songs,btohqsg
Small bands got what recommend de,btohqsg
I from JJ lin and jay chou go to五月天 etc,btohqsg
I didn't quite like PRC Chinese singers,btohqsg
the only prc ik is 我们不一样,btohqsg
the female singer actually sing well,btohqsg

Too bad Stefanie never sing this,btohqsg
She compose lyrics I quite like de,btohqsg

Maths does not belong to me,btohqsg
some topics belong to both math and cs,btohqsg
Math is seriously very mind bending,btohqsg
CS subset of math in the past,btohqsg
Wait someone deleted the f* the treasure message,btohqsg
algorithms theory and machine learning is almost all math,btohqsg
I was relooking at back prop,btohqsg
Is entirely linear al plus multiv cal,btohqsg
Honestly algorithms will start to lose its flashiness once ML takes over,btohqsg
even AI is all math also,btohqsg
Thing is data sci is not just math,btohqsg
data sci is more stats than math,btohqsg
I'm a fake engineer 😂 better don't talk more about ml,btohqsg
