But I didn’t have an option to choose what I wanted my name to be on it and this i applying for their card. Anyway thank you I’ll call them up,btohqsg
Same as mine last time. But i didnt call to change. It might have additional charge.,btohqsg
I just applied and submitted but I did not receive any follow up email or reference number for me to key in to submit my rewards claim. Any idea? Or do I need to wait a little bit longer?,btohqsg
Hmm.. last time its has been generated after submission. That was March 2022. Maybe different now? Also did you had a in-principal-approval?,btohqsg

Hi all  for Revolut  'top up S$300 with a bank account to “activate” the 20% cashback offer for that month  the excess cash can be transferred back to your own bank account in future'. Can we top up $300 & immediately transfer back $200 back to account & still be eligible for the 20% cashback? Thanks.,btohqsg
My Citi cashback card got approved!,btohqsg
$300 top up is the requirement  what you do after that doesn't matter as long as you don't abuse the transfers,btohqsg
I hope you got in on a promotion  there's $350 available,btohqsg
Hi if I link my citi premier mile card to Instarem n uses the Instarem MC to pay sp bill  do I get the points for my premiere mile card?,btohqsg

Am trying to use SRS to buy S27 via POEMS - anyone has any idea how to know how many units I can buy as its in USD or I have to ownself estimate the exchange rate and ensure total cost in USD is lower than the SRS SGD funds with agent bank ?,btohqsg
If the app can accept the credit card  then by right it shd work. For now I only used Grabpay MC and DBS mastercard which both are ok. Tried Amex  cannot link. Nv tried CDC and Jipay.,btohqsg
Ownself estimate and make sure you have enough SGD in your account.Settlement currency in SGD,btohqsg
Hi everyone  wish to check if anyone is aware if foreigners come sg  are they able to use their bank visa or Mastercard to tap onto the bus or enter mrt? Or they need to change to sgd first?,btohqsg
Can  but might not be worth as they are charged an additional $0.60 for each day's fare charged.,btohqsg
So it will be better if they use like youtrip or revolut to convert to sgd first the  use?,btohqsg
Most likely yes. Even without the admin fee I'd think it'll still be cheaper to convert first since youtrip/revolut offers fx at wholesale rate instead of the crappy ones offered through normal CC.,btohqsg
Sorry for a noob question- I alr opened Phillip Smart Portfolio with the initial $300. But how to add money in to invest?,btohqsg
Once you have deposit  just have to wait.,btohqsg
Yup  it's been invested.  But I wanna do monthly investing but can't find the way to do it  maybe because I'm using their app. Maybe I will use their website to check again,btohqsg
Looking to apply for my 1st credit card  any suggestions?Is there a video in explaining how a credit card works?Thanks in advance.,btohqsg
Start with Citi premiermiles card since it has the highest sign up gift now. Meanwhile slowly learn how a credit card works,btohqsg
What kind of credit card are you looking for? Miles  cashback??,btohqsg
I see. Personally for myself. I'm using the UOB AMEX Credit Card where I get 1.7% cashback + Grabpay card because AMEX is not widely accepted in every shop therefore converting it to a MasterCard using Grab. Other than that  I don't really use anything else.,btohqsg
My card cannot cancel within 12 months or the reward will be returned...,btohqsg
So only 2nd year I can apply for the bank again? (With regards to credit card churning),btohqsg

hi guys  which credit cards would you recommend for flights and hotels?,btohqsg
but I'm not quite into miles as it's too hard to calculate  what about cash-back cards?,btohqsg
I have Citi's Cashback+ and StanChart's Smart card  mostly for the signup bonuses. Thinking about HSBC Revolution,btohqsg
me too  but these two don't have much advantage compared to AMEX + GrabPay,btohqsg
