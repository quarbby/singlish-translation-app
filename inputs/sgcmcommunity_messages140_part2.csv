You also ask weird questions. Some of that makes no sense if you also consider manual transmissions. Push clutch to start a manual. Lets you start it in any gear or neutral. They could easily require the brake pedal to be pushed. Pushing in the clutch lets the car roll if neither brake is engaged.,btohqsg

You also need to learn to accept the answers. Their answer all logical but you not accepting. I give you something to consider as a better question with answer and if you question more with this as a question I‚Äôll think you more logical. But you like not thinking logically,btohqsg
