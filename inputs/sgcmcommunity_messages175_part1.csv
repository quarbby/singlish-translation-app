I took it to a Mazda specialist who had seen lots and he said he had never seen damage like that on the underside before,btohqsg
Bro I saw your post at reddit,btohqsg
any workshop claiming to be mazda specialist unless they are doing rotary engines  quite laughable,btohqsg
more likely than not they trying to carrot you to repair everything,btohqsg
Maybe I phrased wrongly. Just a workshop that services lots of Mazda's,btohqsg
No  I looked up past reviews and their history.,btohqsg
Least I can do is warn others üòî,btohqsg
chassis not affected leh liar liar pants on fire,btohqsg

Hi Andrew  Sam here from Cartell. We sent the vehicle to your workshop for the PPI.1. You told my staff that you would like to back out from the deal as the car has too many wear & tear. Our agreement was for engine  gearbox and chassis damage. Afterwards  you changed your story and told us that the workshop claims that the car is an accident unit. I called up the workshop personally and checked. He is unable to confirm that the car is involved in an accident before and ask to seek second opinion from STA (which I suggested to you too)And if they say it's an accident unit I will also fully refund you your deposit.2. This deal I have given you a $2000 discount  1 year warranty for engine and gearbox. Also I have offered to fix up the coolant leaks if there is any. I strongly believe that the $2000 that we have extended to you as a discount is more than sufficient to fix up the wear & tear but you are spinning tales around. I hope you understand I will go to any extent to make sure our reputable name is not tarnished. So pls bring down your defamatory post and let's end this amicably. I have done my part to honour the deal. If you still wish to back out I think it's only fair for us to forfeit the deposit.,btohqsg
"Hi Sam 1. I was uncomfortable to purchase the car because of the damages found by the workshop  not the wear and tear. This was made clear to you and your colleagues.2. I was initially ok to proceed with this purchase if you could fix the issues in the PPI so that I can buy the car in the condition it was advertised i.e. ""meticulously maintained""  ""NEW driveshaft"". Over the phone you also assured us that undercarriage had just been done up because there was ""shakiness and noisiness"" yet there was still damage found.3. The $2000 discount is irrelevant because the condition of the car that was promised is different from what we found to be true after the PPI.",btohqsg
Sam n Andrew  pls take this elsewhere,btohqsg
WAIT.. I think that day I saw him .. not loud leh‚Ä¶,btohqsg
Interesting though to understand facts as the story unfolds. üëçüèº,btohqsg
Always listen to both side of the stories before making any judgement!,btohqsg
Which dealer never copy paste text onto the ads on their listings sia,btohqsg
Condition major problem refund deposit  minor problems can compromise. Oil and coolant leak on a 16 year old car is as common as old man having bad joints,btohqsg
If don't understand that maybe... Buy new car... If cannot afford  better take public transport,btohqsg
Only thing that's over is the deposit,btohqsg
I saw 2 solutions in this  1. They offered to do up the damage then take the car   2. They offered to get a second opinion from STA inspection to confirm your claims  if u are confident u will win that or have the damage done up why not just take it,btohqsg
After its a 16 year old japanese car,btohqsg
And the damage isnt detrimental  its fixable,btohqsg
change mind try to weasel back his  2000 dollars only,btohqsg
not even close to being scam,btohqsg
Sometimes it‚Äôs just down to understanding T&Cs  inclusions/exclusionsclearlybefore signing anything. Do the necessary homework and ask all the questions / concerns one needs upfront before signing. if we can do that for our employers  all the more so we should do when it comes to spending own hard earned money?,btohqsg
Not siding anyone here of coz,btohqsg
Think already quite nice to let him take to his own workshop for PPI ‚Ä¶,btohqsg
when he first put out his statement he straight away say he got scammed.. this kind of thing can be quite damaging to businesses,btohqsg
Not like I own anything but I sometimes wonder  why do people have to place deposit for a PPI if it‚Äôs totally on the buyer‚Äôs cost?,btohqsg
