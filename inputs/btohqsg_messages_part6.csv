Open Booking of Flats â€“ Housing & Development Board (HDB)https://esales.hdb.gov.sg/bp25/launch/open/OPEN_page_6192/home.html,btohqsg
I find OBF is good if only you get to choose brand new condition house,btohqsg
Cannot get queue Aug. Anyone can recommend this balance Flats?,btohqsg
OBF is a rename of reoffer of balance flat,btohqsg
Otherwise  opt for resale as you're allowed to view as many units as you like,btohqsg
Skali after 20% dropouts  you'd be in like queue 170+,btohqsg
ðŸ˜‚ - so many dropouts expected for amk?,btohqsg
Yea good to keep . I was 181 out of 187 flats . When i go pick my flat that time still got like 80+ units ðŸ˜Š,btohqsg
Because they will screen ur eligibility before u are allowed to choose ur flat . U can expect alot of drop outs cus they fail to meet the eligibility,btohqsg
oh wow thats good to know! what do ppl fail mostly during eligibility?,btohqsg
That im not sure . Maybe income ? Or their desired unit taken up so they dont want the bto anymore,btohqsg
Cus i remember my sist wueue was 320+ out of 187 units . And she was given a timeslot to go down and choose 3 months later,btohqsg
wow - which location was this?,btohqsg
Mine was woodlands so demand wasnt high i guess,btohqsg
Hi guys  anyone know when going down to book flat.Does the couple need to go down or can just 1 of the couple will do?,btohqsg
U mean 2 person need to sign ?,btohqsg
Log in to your HDB page and see,btohqsg
What about open booking of flat,btohqsg
I think all is the same. 2 owner=2 people sign .,btohqsg
Unless 1 owner the other is occupant,btohqsg
Anyway 4rm and 5rm same amount of option fee,btohqsg
Previously sent email to hdb to ask about it. They sent me this,btohqsg
Opps . 2nd appointment then need 2 people,btohqsg
Ya. Is the downpayment time need both applicants,btohqsg
So now await for news on the selection date,btohqsg
I mean for those who have ballot for Aug BTO,btohqsg
is it normal for HLE Letter to be generated instantly? thought it takes 2 weeks to be generated,btohqsg
I only know it is up to 4 weeks,btohqsg
If I give up my Q number in open booking flat scheme  will it affect my chances in normal bto application?,btohqsg
queue number in open booking wont affect your first timer chances etc  only waste $10,btohqsg
Any idea how often hdb refreshes the page on flat for open booking?,btohqsg
24x/118 units yâ€™all think got chance or not ah?,btohqsg
If only your number is below 140,btohqsg
Sigh.. can only hope for high drop out rate I guess  since itâ€™s CCK. ðŸ˜¬,btohqsg
So I told her she needs a bit of luck,btohqsg
Eh sorry sala should be multiply by 0.85,btohqsg
So should be 85% allocated to first timers,btohqsg
So 85% of 118 units for FT   100 units.. Divided by 0.8  to be below 125 to have 20% chance of getting a unit but on low floor,btohqsg
why divide by 0.8 haha sorry don't rly get the math,btohqsg
Normally there's 20% dropout for each BTO launch,btohqsg
Unless your number is very good,btohqsg
Or can straightaway multiply by 1.25 after counting the allocated flats (5%/15%85%/95% etc),btohqsg
Anybody gonna ballot november de launch? Jaha,btohqsg
