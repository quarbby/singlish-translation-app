Hi  for HSBC everyday + rewards qualification  does it works if I transfer 2k and immediately transfer it out?,btohqsg
Thanks. So the buy trade requirements can be met by buying Fullerton Money Market Fund? Just want to be sure. What about other platforms eg Webull?,btohqsg
Yes  based on what others have tried (I bought stocks).Webull doesn't have 5.8% p.a. promo for new users,btohqsg
Anyone else not getting cashback for fsm debit card? I spent in Jun till now haven't get the cashback,btohqsg
For reference  around $5310 excess on top of $20k.,btohqsg

Hi everyone  I have a question for CPF. My father is now 83 years old and he is receiving a monthly payout from his FRS which I predicted will last for another 3 years... if I start contributing to his CPF every month  will his monthly payout be increased?,btohqsg
Thanks. I think the worst thing that will happens is get 1.2 KrisFlyer miles per S$1 spend for other spend rather than 3,btohqsg
My dad is the same age as yours. His time is still under the MMS (i did not convert for him to CPF Life).So whatever he has inside in RA  CPF will try to disburse the monies inside upon him reaching 85.However  i am transferring to him via my OA at the end of each year so that i top back up to the same level he has started. (This way he can use it as a high yield ATM.machine which credits his bank acc for his use on monthly basis)I do it via OA  as i am making use of the int from OA to defray some of my cash outflow to him as a monthly pension for him.,btohqsg
Hello experts  I have a question. I'm 36yo with 23k in OA and 105k in SA. Should I move my OA to SA to capitalise on the 4% interest to grow the money? No interest in investing anywhere else at the moment.,btohqsg
Not really. 1.2 mpd is not the worst. If the oversea merchants have monkey mcc code  especially in Japan  they like to use Utilities mcc code  you will end up getting nothing. ie. zero mile.,btohqsg
for CIMB account  their e-banking portal is not auto-signup? we have to go down to the branch to sign up ah?,btohqsg
The top up limit to RA is ERS,btohqsg
While waiting for other guru to comment  you may want to take a look on this.https://youtu.be/te9o1hJWDig?si=Nxr9Z2pQ4daEbEkO,btohqsg
one of my humans is also suffering the same grief as you i guesstrying to signup for weeks and it keeps saying NO MOBILE NUMBER ON RECORD even after we sent in Service Request Form as indicated on the error message.Somehow you need to get CIMB BANKING SIDE (not credit card side) to know your mobile number before you can register for CLICKS.The human with problem has actually been a CIMB credit card holder for YEARS with valid OTP number registered... sigh.,btohqsg
The 1st 20k in OA will earn 3.5%.  Take note that once OA is transferred to SA  there is no way to reverse it. If you want to transfer  suggest to do for the 3k.,btohqsg
Wa.. Sounds like their processes not very efficient,btohqsg
So i should keep 20 k in the OA and then move anything over it to SA?,btohqsg
Im just trying to maximize growth for RA. I don't have any morgage so all my cpf contribution from now is purely for retirement,btohqsg
My OA and SA contributions on total are Bout 38k/yr.. Bit more now cause medisave hit max already,btohqsg
No need to keep 20k if you have no use for it. Since your combined balances are already over $60K  it will earn the max 1% additional interest. Do note of the irreversible nature.As Mouse Hunter has mentioned  you may watch this video to decidehttps://youtu.be/te9o1hJWDig?si=Nxr9Z2pQ4daEbEkO,btohqsg

Hi guys  following up on previous qn on credit card payment for restaurants in australia  is this charge indicated on menu the same as credit card fees we normally talk about or isit an additional charge on top of that?,btohqsg
If i use amaze card  are these fees still charged? Any better way to pay in restaurants in australia besides cash?,btohqsg
common in Australia. Charged on top of bill,btohqsg
This is actually a very good question.From my experience with DEBIT CARDS like Amaze in Australia:1. If the terminal is programmed properly (no staff intervention)  debit cards like Amaze will not attract any fee if the rule is CREDIT CARDS pay 2% for example.2. However if it is a staff intervention entry  they may still add on 2% charge manually for you whether you use Debit or Credit card (either they don't care or they don't know the difference).,btohqsg
Hi all  I booked a fully refundable booking in Airbnb using DBS CC  but the charges for the initial payment and the refund amount is off by a few dollars. Any idea whether I can ask DBS to pay the difference(likely due to currency) or just absorb the difference? Thanks!,btohqsg
So it got really stupid...If I use:1. Amaze + UOB krisflyer = I pay AUD50 for example2. UOB krisflyer = I pay AUD51 for example,btohqsg
Oh i see! Rarely itll be manually operated i suppose. Seems like bringing cash is the way to go? What about other places like malls or small vendors that have credit card terminals?,btohqsg
NO NO NO Australia never use cash unless there is CASH DISCOUNT.Even if there is credit card surcharge  by using the correct cashback/miles cards  you will still have a net positive gain compared to cash.Manually operated could be those mum and pop diners..Bill is AUD50.. you say you pay with EFTPOST.. you pay AUDyou pay with credit  cashier presses AUD51 for you to paywave,btohqsg
I have citi premier miles  hsbc revolution  and DBS altitude cards. Which ones would be best for australia if pairing with amaze card?,btohqsg
You only have 1 choice as you cant pair Visa cards with amaze,btohqsg
Oh thats true... If its citi premiermiles  isit worth it to use amaze card to pay in aussie vs cash?,btohqsg
Worth or not is up to you,btohqsg
Im not sure what that means,btohqsg
Depends on your mile-valuation  Amaze's exchange ratebased on chris i think is 1.5%?Cash wise  depends on your cash-on-hand ability  and the FX you converted,btohqsg
"My personal view is I prefer to use card everywhere I go cause I won't have to deal with ""stubborn"" money to convert to SGD back at a poor exchange rate",btohqsg
"Hi there  just synced my Citi Rewards (newly signed up card) with Amaze. Made my first transaction earlier. I see that I had earned ""O"" IPs. Is there a reason it's not being reflected? What does IP mean?Thanks everyone üôè",btohqsg
U don't earn anything when using it in SG. Ip only for foreign spend,btohqsg
instarem points  only earn from foreign spend,btohqsg
Thanks! What about earning the 4mpd? Would I be able to see that accumulation on the Citibank mobile app?,btohqsg
can check daily points rewarded on citi rewards website,btohqsg
