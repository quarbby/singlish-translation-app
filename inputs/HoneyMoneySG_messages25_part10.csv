think u mixed up uob absolute Amex and Amex True Cashback,btohqsg
Whoops thanks  I forgot the name of the AMEX one for a while there lol,btohqsg
Read somewhere that it only applies to first payment  is it true?,btohqsg
The 1.5% cashback is obtained every time you top up your GPMC  nothing to do with the payment to the insurer,btohqsg

Which banks allow to pay for HSBC and CIMB credit card bills? I see that OCBC not possible,btohqsg
hihi would u guys recommend putting momeny in unit trusts eg jp morgan with uob bank?,btohqsg
No  go open a low cost brokerage a/c  and DCA into an index ETF...,btohqsg
ah ok  what would the rationale be? the lady at the bank was saying they offering 7-9% dividends for that unit trust,btohqsg
Most likely the 7-9% dividends are projected and non guaranteed.,btohqsg
There's fees to be paid to a fund manager who manages the unit trust... usually more than what you'd pay if u DCA into an index ETF...,btohqsg
These fees will offset any returns that u may have from the investments itself...,btohqsg
Most unit trusts are typically of this nature...,btohqsg

My Uob Absolute+Grab will get nerf soon so I need a replacement in case I cannot use Amex.Things I buy are home hardwares  toilet hardwares  floor tiles can use non-amex card. Raw materials only paynow or cash payment so no cards payment. Mostly are out of the common MCC range.Any cards to recommend after max my EVOL? HSBC revo rejected my application. Haizzz...,btohqsg

Just realised the DBS WWMC has a minimum income of $80k/year..Would it be better for me to get dbs altitude  citi premier or uob visa signature instead?ðŸ¤”,btohqsg
Dbs wwmc income requirement not very strict  I managed to get it even though my income is less than 80k pa.. But for me I have a dbs/posb savings account so I'm not sure if that helped,btohqsg
Apply for a normal $30k dbs card  then apply for WWMC. Should be insta approved,btohqsg
Oh i already have exisiting posb account,btohqsg
If i already have a exisiting posb savings accountDo i still need to apply again for a 30k income requirement credit card?,btohqsg
Can just apply and see what is the outcome  no harm,btohqsg
You can apply online through posb ibanking,btohqsg
If you don't have any DBS card yet  apply for yuu first ($250 cash).Other cards only $150 cash for now,btohqsg

How long does it take for UOB One CC to approve?,btohqsg

ya youtube video miss out on the investment part  so am i correct to say apply credit card first  later then apply for ega via direct hsbc web to avoid investment part?,btohqsg
If I already have a HSBC credit card  means no chance to participate correct?,btohqsg
If I link my citi rewards card to amaze card and use amaze to book air tickets and hotel booking. Is it $500 eligible spend?,btohqsg
To clarify on the requirements for HSBC EGA $350 Singsaver gift:- Deposit $5000 on opening  $5000 on following month- Maintain the EGA account by monthly deposit $2000 and 5 transactions.- At the video time 03:33 Yes you need to apply for investment account and make 1 trade- For SGX stock trade  the min brokerage fee is $11 SGD after GST. Can just buy the cheapest stock. But $11+ is the minimum cash outlay,btohqsg
Will the $350 gift or cashback subsequently be affected if we withdraw the fresh fund deposited?,btohqsg
Sources have reflected that if you have credit card before EGA  the EGA application cannot be done online and will require Physical application  so YMMV,btohqsg
Deleted my source  will verify again,btohqsg
Any suggestions on the cheapest trade to satisfy the requirement?,btohqsg
Data point : yes hsbc staff told me need to do manual giro to qualify for EGA 1%,btohqsg
Refer to my edited comment above^,btohqsg
Hi guys  first time applying for HSBC card  couldn't get through the application on the website so I applied thru the app instead.. It says my application got approved but I did not receive any email with regards to my application no... I scared I can't apply for Singsaver rewards ðŸ˜¥,btohqsg
@dukesun99does citi rewards and hsbc revo both getting 4mpd?,btohqsg
