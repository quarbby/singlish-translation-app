Because they donâ€™t even have enough to sell 1 box/household,btohqsg
"and even if so  couldnt they ease the people into masks gradually  rather than a ""not sick no need wear policy"" to reduce the abruptness of the u turn",btohqsg
lol got people 1 person buy 12 bbtðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
Well  you must realise that those belong to the more kiasi and more privileged in society. Those out around normally wont care. Even now  theres a bunch of people (300 so far iirc) who were caught not wearing masksIn the SAF  I was asked to remove a mask I was wearing because of govt and camp policy.,btohqsg
before this  confirm have even more people dont wear masks,btohqsg
^ if the only reason why they discourage is panic buy  why cannot do the above? Check IC = cannot buy excess le what,btohqsg
Yes  the whole cb could have been done faster if the govt didnt take 4 weeks to u turn,btohqsg
It doesn't have to be a mask iirc,btohqsg
I mean  it's clear within the SAF that right up until the point where all the BMT enlistees had to pack up and leave  there was a 'no URTI symptoms no mask' policy  which demonstrates the stance of MINDEF  as well as the government as a whole,btohqsg
That was the start of April  mind you,btohqsg
They didn't treat it as seriously as they should,btohqsg
Ong Ye Kung legit brought forward the June holidays,btohqsg
plus what you just said implies the fact that you (and the government) are betting on the presumption that singaporeans wont listen to government instructions...which is really not how I think a crisis as big as this should be dealt with,btohqsg
Means the kids will be studying during June,btohqsg
Okay it's irrelevant  but I completely disagree that Singaporeans tend to look at things with skepticism,btohqsg
this is probably more of the case,btohqsg
yeah I mean it goes both ways. They could be skeptical about the government's response and skeptical about the severeness of the disease.Some of them think the disease is not as serious as it is and some think that the government is not doing enough,btohqsg
you are betting on the second case,btohqsg
no  when I look around me at that time I see that most people aint masked up  but of course thats simply an observation,btohqsg
Organic Chem not in O Level Chem anymore,btohqsg
Then what o level chem learn sia,btohqsg
im not in uni haha but its an observation around me. Maybe in poly/JC where the students are more educated and less old folks  you can see the increase in mask wearing,btohqsg
Not v big deal actually it is just a small topic in emath,btohqsg
Wonder what their definition of snacks is,btohqsg
This month is gonna be loOONG,btohqsg
I'm still gonna get my chocolates,btohqsg
Nothing is going to stop me from getting chocolates,btohqsg
But the occasional milk chocolate bar is good,btohqsg
"I mean you cant fault them for not stocking up. All they hear on the news is just ""not sick no need mask"" ""virus well controlled in singapore"" ""plans to lower dorscon level (remember that?)"".People act based on the news they hear. Older people get more news via the government. Perhaps you are more fortunate  but do remember that plenty of old people  especially the less fortunate will put this disease at the back of their minds",btohqsg
but you can only enter on certain days,btohqsg
depends on the last digit of your IC,btohqsg
So I usually buy kinder brenuo or smth,btohqsg
Tbh seeing how MOE has those common last topics,btohqsg
Makes sense that my year SS had Venice as CLT,btohqsg
The tiny ones don't seem worth to me,btohqsg

Even if thereâ€™s holiday in June u still canâ€™t travel,btohqsg
Tbh the only thing I can say is,btohqsg
Especially for the graduating cohorts they get to skip out on quite a bit of topics lol,btohqsg
