Ever happened before   many year ago liao ... last time also got plane got incident here,btohqsg
Pilot might be seeing some shadow unclear thing   i doesn't want to say so much ...you ppl should be know what i trying to say,btohqsg
Flying is a lot of automation,btohqsg
They let the machine do most of the job for big aircrafts,btohqsg
Pilots sit and monitor for anomalies. They certainly wonâ€™t touch the controls because of shadow. The plane will still fly through anything the radar did not capture,btohqsg
Fake news. It's not their pic,btohqsg
First theres only 2 person who dint board tat plane. A girl n a guy. The guy cancelled his tic  the girl bought his tic but cuz the bf tell her dun go back  she stayed.,btohqsg

Process of elimination. On my second try I got letters 2 and 3. Crucial one was letter 2 cos there are only a handful of letters that u can fit before it. The highest possible is letter S  but I eliminated that letter so whatâ€™s left behind is only a couple of possible letters,btohqsg
