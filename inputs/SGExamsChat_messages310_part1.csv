I can say....Forget abt local uni if u have private dip,btohqsg
Ppl tAke local dip and a level also may not get into local uni,btohqsg
Cuz can Still go local poly,btohqsg
ITE then local poly is a longer route but worth it in the long run,btohqsg
ITE student here  finished 2 yrs Nitec  now doing Higher Nitec 1st yr,btohqsg
Am hoping to go to local poly after Higher Nitec. However  I am scared that ITE students hv a harder chance of entering poly  as they accept O lvls students first.,btohqsg
Unfortunately  my family cannot afford private diplomas at private school,btohqsg
Dun worry there was the new policy that they are accepting more higher nitec into poky,btohqsg
And ite students have a diff path from Os,btohqsg
Part of the Aspire programme if I remember correctly in 2016,btohqsg
My neighbour is ITE then NP then NTU,btohqsg
No matter uni or not...Local diploma wins private diploma,btohqsg
Heard a lot of Higher Nitec students got rejected for JPAE 2021. Most of the ITE grads who entered poly did so via EAE  as far as I know.,btohqsg
So at least ur local diploma can get an OK job,btohqsg
Not say go ITE means sure go p0ly,btohqsg
Go for the common smth prog,btohqsg
My bestfriend in that course rn,btohqsg
And based on my friend's bf just get through eae GPA 2.5 can go in de,btohqsg
Am looking to go to Information Technology in SP.,btohqsg
Hey guys any opinions of the course business infomation system?,btohqsg
A mix of business and IT and it allows u to go study IT in future,btohqsg
I got some relatives teaching that course in ite,btohqsg
Then how about the business element in it? Wouldn't that be kinda wasteful if can't go smth business too?,btohqsg
it allows u swap between both esp when u pursue uni,btohqsg
for example if you are considering a double major,btohqsg
personally if your more interested in biz just go full on for a biz course  but I warn u the low courses are competitive,btohqsg
Idk? I not their student but,btohqsg
I know alot of their student made it to poly uh,btohqsg
Business can pick up next time if u want...IE. MBA... U can't go from a business dip or degree to IT that easily without stating over,btohqsg
U can always pick up biz in future easily,btohqsg
Actually the curriculum should be posted somewhere om their website,btohqsg
But to do IT in future with a biz knowledge...I think near impossible,btohqsg
personal experience choose what u want :) if your not a big fan of IT i suggest you dont do it  and against IT specialisation depends... some IT do a lot of coding  some do a lot of modeling etc,btohqsg
I would say that IT and Biz are 2 of the most competitve school generally,btohqsg
Agree too .. if u hate coding ..u just hate coding...it's not for everyone,btohqsg
esp  on the accounting side u need to learn c#  sql  and python,btohqsg
also In poly theres this thing known as diploma + or PLP  it allows u to pursue 'mini' diplomas aka minors in other sectors  eg. like IOT  AI etc,btohqsg
IS is not just about coding tho,btohqsg
depends on what u really like :) the popular courses in IT and Bis are generally an L1r4 of 4-9 ish?  feel free to ask me if u want,btohqsg
U can further study business info systems in rp cuz they have a course thr too,btohqsg
IMO  they are using the name 'business' to lure students in to study,btohqsg
E.g. engineering many find it boring  then put 'engineering with business' suddenly intake increase,btohqsg
Somehow maybe students nowadays want to be own boss and do own 'business'. But like what someone said  it might be better to do a full pure course instead of these 'rojak' ones,btohqsg
E.g. say a full engineering course needs say 30 modules.Now to fill in some 'business elements' and to still keep it at 30 modules means some content has to go.So it means as a future engineer those who take the hybrid course won't learn as much as those who take purely engineering.Then want to do business  they also learn only a fraction compared to those who took on a full diploma solely on business.,btohqsg
ps. NP has an interesting program for entrepreneurial business.,btohqsg
its called SANDBOX  they will give u a $5k grant to start your business,btohqsg
if its successful they will give u another $10k for incubator stage,btohqsg
oh no wodner my friend opened a food business,btohqsg
yes they have a cca for budding entrepreneurs and things like that,btohqsg
theres like a prototyping section resevred for them which u can book for free and also many interesting events  like tedex etc.,btohqsg
