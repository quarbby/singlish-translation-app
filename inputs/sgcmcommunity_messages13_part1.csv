PI u bother to ask whether service with AD meh😂😂🤭🤭,btohqsg
Worry too much i see many car owners.,btohqsg
best read your book. dont listen to many here.,btohqsg
Thot they have recommended workshops to go to as well,btohqsg
Cannot tahandown time1 -  2 week no car drive..😅 shag.Take taxi. Got ciggerate smells. Children smell free 2nd smoke.,btohqsg
Go workshops also not smoke free lor,btohqsg
Book cannot trust la.Honda Freed gb7 says DCT clutch fluid don't need to ever change.You see GAG  gearbox repair. Clutch fluid never change.Leak.. whole gearbox overhaul,btohqsg
Until gov stop and ban cigarettes  nothing is clean air around us. More so with the office opened these days,btohqsg
My kids. I choose how he lives yeah?2nd hand smoke in taxi is No No No.Taxi driver cannot smoke in car.Under LTA law.I also have child seat for my kids.,btohqsg
Cigarette will not be banned.Largest tax earning.They will only big more smoking cubicles. Like Japan,btohqsg
Sorry not questioning how you choose how your kids lives is. Just a general statement that kids these days have better life,btohqsg
No problems.👍I believe as Singapore progressWe wants better lives.We have more choices 👍,btohqsg
I can concur the revenue caveats but just something doesn’t equate when it comes to healthcare expenses where the so-called shared burden is about.,btohqsg
Yeah. It changing.Alot new no smoking zone.More estates are installing smoking cabin.Can't ban cigarette 🚬 totally.It's like an freedom to smoke and release stress.I used to smoke heavily. Quit.My uncle dies due cancers at 60  from smoking.,btohqsg
I don’t think change will be happening in our lifetime until EV become the norms.,btohqsg
By then 2040  even the 4g ministers all retiring liao. 😂,btohqsg
I still dk hw ev can be convenient.. charging time so long. Unless all lot has ev point.. if not everyone will just be snatching them up,btohqsg
You seen China?Their EV battery swap is 3 seconds.,btohqsg
They tell you to re-adjust your behaviour,btohqsg
but nt happening in sg for e batt swap,btohqsg
This concept will be a game changer,btohqsg
They have to go full EV in the cities during peak hours.Because pollutions forces them.Pollutions in Singapore can also force the country to go full EVs😂,btohqsg
At least if it even happen 😅 must start with commercial vehicles,btohqsg
Places i usually go dont have ev charging. Den i need to purposely go to places that has one to charge. Nearest shell/caltex ev charging is 10-15min drive away,btohqsg
You know it's difficult. Because of bidding systems.Shenzhen Electric bus service tried to bid for Redhill bus route but was out bid.😂,btohqsg
It won’t be like a stations where you can quickly refuel.,btohqsg
At least a 30mins downtime.. if got car charging den + the balance time,btohqsg
Battery swap is a good idea but how many car brands are universal to this. 😅,btohqsg
Plan your time as many will state.,btohqsg
Ev motorcycle in sg can buy car. Over 60k for one.,btohqsg
https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-08-16/EV-battery-swapping-finds-new-life-in-China-SWZQhFZoEE/index.htmlEV swap for cars and taxis in china,btohqsg
One charge is like a one tank of fuel. Just a matter of scheduling when to recharge.,btohqsg
Bcos GoGoGo is not considering enter Singapore markets.It's a tiny market for them.Vietnam/Taiwan/Philippines/Thailand will be better😂,btohqsg
I think this is taiwan right? They have good economic scales.,btohqsg
EV swap will happens.Just need to wait.Soon or later the super ultra rich will get fed up Q-ing to charge.They will launch a startup EV swap😂😂😂,btohqsg
Even food delivery was started to become norms in sg when it was much established in hongkong.,btohqsg
Wrong. Super rich don’t bother. They have fleet of cars,btohqsg
I waiting for gov to impose ABSD on cars. 😅,btohqsg
you forget one thing - battery technology improves fast and charging times will be vastly reduced. swapping is expensive thing and people wont use it anymore,btohqsg
No matter how fast.Can't full charge in 3 secs,btohqsg
but you will need more than 3 seconds to get out of your car!\,btohqsg
With electrics  you won't wait for the battery to run down completely like some might do with fuel tanks. Rather  you just do small top ups whenever possible. For example  going to the airport to drop someone and you parked up  leave it charging for 10 minutes. Going to the mall for dinner  park at the charging spot while you eat,btohqsg
do you take 3 seconds to fuel up?,btohqsg
It requires a lifestyle change for sure,btohqsg
Maybe toyota or bmw can start the battery swapping thingy where it benefit them mostly due to economic of scales.,btohqsg
Bmw first to intro e-cars in sg right?,btohqsg
and why is it still selling very well?,btohqsg
No.If battery swap from NIO is available.Many many ppl will gives up petrol car.But now there is none.So can't debate on it 😂,btohqsg
3 minutesNIO Power SwapIt takes only 3 minutes* to swap a fully charged battery. Automatic battery and electric system checks are performed during each swap to keep both the vehicle and battery in the best shape.https://www.nio.com› nio-powerNIO Power,btohqsg
NO. not at all. battery swapping NIO solves imminent problems in cities. but in other countries people dont bother. they will get used or adjust to charging,btohqsg
