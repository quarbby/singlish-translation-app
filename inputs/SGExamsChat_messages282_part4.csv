I wish I took the June paper,btohqsg

Oh shit I gotta versus you noooo,btohqsg

i think moe published an article explicitly stating so,btohqsg
Theres moderation so it's still somewhat competitve,btohqsg
Ruithe only person u are competiting with is yourself during June,btohqsg
The bell curve is still there no matter what,btohqsg
Choose one with the course structure that's most suitable for you. Different polys might have courses with the same name but vastly different structure.,btohqsg
Paya lebar to bishan is slower,btohqsg
what do you mean by structure,btohqsg
168 is the fastest lifehack from woodlands and from bedok,btohqsg
Core modules taught might be different,btohqsg
Depends on the focus the faculty decided on,btohqsg
Eg  SP Applied Chemistry and NYP Applied Chemistry focus is different,btohqsg
SP version is more pivotable to uni,btohqsg
969 faster ? but it goes via yishun ..,btohqsg
I think they hand more Ls than acceptance,btohqsg
If you can find out if you were rejected from eae portal?,btohqsg
Did you see it? Is either that or acceptance,btohqsg
But waiting time is Hella long,btohqsg
are you talking woodlands to Tampines or what,btohqsg
Unless the driver keep skipping stops,btohqsg
168 skips yishun and sembawang and goes straight to woodlands,btohqsg
But loops at the east so many times,btohqsg
Like doesn't it go Bedok rev-)tamp west,btohqsg
Aso ur friend on insta req me,btohqsg
24 stops from where to where,btohqsg
I just counted the stops HAHA,btohqsg
I take 168 to my student place at befok,btohqsg
why not change to mrt at tampinesunless 168 goes your destination directly idk,btohqsg
If you take from tampines mrt it will only do like half the looping,btohqsg
I take full journey from either end  usually bedok to woodlands is longer  average 1h+ journey,btohqsg
But if very very lucky it can take 50mins tops,btohqsg
its the best song if it was released in donda,btohqsg

He is just a cool guy after all.,btohqsg
It's true though  the fact that it's better than CLB  hahahah,btohqsg
