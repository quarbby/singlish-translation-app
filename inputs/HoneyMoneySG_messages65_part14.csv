Am not sure whether all banks have the selection of salary payment. I use BOC Mcsa.,btohqsg
Oh you used BOC tsf to UOB?,btohqsg
this will count towards salary credit under giro? sorry for asking cos im new to this,btohqsg
Yes. I did this before and it works.,btohqsg
Also  you can do multiple transfers to make up 1.6K,btohqsg
I have checked with uob on this.,btohqsg
if i have cashback in SCB credit card   can i withdraw it in cash by withdrawing from the ATM? will it incur any fees ? cause i don't plan to use SCB credit card already and i want the cashback in $$,btohqsg
u would hv to check wif the CS. But i tink u cant withdraw fm ATM like this. Def will hv fees incurred. Account closure then they send u cheque more likely.,btohqsg
"but shouldn't cashback be forfeited if you close the account ? in my case the cashback is said ""used to credit off next month statement"" or something",btohqsg
Anyone did not receive the everyday+ SMS confirmation from HSBC this month (Sep) after fulfilling the 2k + 5 trf?,btohqsg
anyone tried the new CIMB SG bank flat rate 3.5% for first six month for saving account ? or any coverage for it? Appreciated.,btohqsg
wont recommend that tbh. Better to spread the applications every month/alternate months if possible. have been doing cc churning past few years and applications marginally affects ur credit score. Major factors that affects the score includes timeliness of payments and the amount u spend.,btohqsg

if i have cashback in SCB credit card   can i withdraw it in cash by withdrawing from the ATM? will it incur any fees ? cause i don't plan to use SCB credit card already and i want the cashback in $$,btohqsg
You cant. Need offset your spending,btohqsg
"You can just spend something close to that cashback. And then you ""pay yourself"" the cash. That is like withdrawing the cashback",btohqsg
so withdrawing cash isn't technically spending ? like straight up cash . okay thanks.,btohqsg
i believe if you withdraw cash is = cash advance. fees are involved. i could be wrong  not very familiar.,btohqsg
