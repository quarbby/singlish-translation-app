TSD has ppl from A101 A201 A301 S412,btohqsg
my batch has no science people took tsd,btohqsg
i think from the looks of it  they expanded on subject combinations,btohqsg
3 in 402  my friend in my class,btohqsg
only a timetabling headache for the timetabling com,btohqsg
probably like 1 single person from there,btohqsg
wah now pe is mixed class?,btohqsg
Got only 1 person take tsd,btohqsg
My class mixed w 502 on mon  308 on fri,btohqsg
pe i still dk who we are mixed with,btohqsg
on thurs i rmb we playing tchoukball then my grp did small game with them,btohqsg
no like i still don't know them well,btohqsg
but i've been with them before,btohqsg
All i rmb was we had sci ppl taking h2 art lol,btohqsg
then we all realise how unathletic we are compared to them,btohqsg
maybe my class was alone coz there are 18 girls,btohqsg
Eh ya I think I blur alrd,btohqsg
i remembered the guys one was with 18s404,btohqsg
Does your pe classes seperate girls and boys?,btohqsg
i can walk halfway and collapse on the ground,btohqsg
Actly my sec sch alrd do it,btohqsg
So I didn't feel any culture shock,btohqsg
Okies so my jc aint abnornal lol,btohqsg
me is 4y never see guys,btohqsg
I kena culture shock when i reached jc ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
my sec sch towards the end of sec 4 we just play whatever sport we want then the girls will be sitting in the corner,btohqsg
Like I don't rly care abt 2.4 timings or what,btohqsg
I just get it done w,btohqsg
For us we were forced to make games ðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
Then U confirm will hear ppl shout bday songs in canteen,btohqsg
eh they never change the cheers lmao,btohqsg
my sec sch i have never heard any cheer,btohqsg
i remembered my house got this something about number 1  1 1,btohqsg
the only semblance of sch spirit is,btohqsg
that is all i remember lol,btohqsg
they could have reused the house mames,btohqsg
does it at least sound good,btohqsg
our sch song sounds like it was made with garageband,btohqsg
Maybe cuz it's a Chinese song,btohqsg
TAKE ME BACK TO JC ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­,btohqsg
my sec school house is like for show,btohqsg
my sec sch have no houses lol,btohqsg
i feel like signing up for homecoming,btohqsg
I have to mention yijc if not i kena mistaken for tmjc LOL,btohqsg
We had 11 PCM classes :D,btohqsg
you mean you're not enjoying your time with rainer :O,btohqsg
1 of them had ALL boys,btohqsg
The only girl was the form teacher,btohqsg
Combine with H2 FM so we all good,btohqsg
then got girls taking h2 fm,btohqsg
i remembered got 1 arts class (either A201 or A202) with just 1 guy,btohqsg
also damn u from the era when yijc still had fm,btohqsg
We had 1 H2 fm guy from student council lololol,btohqsg
i heard EJC the CSE/CSC class has only one guy,btohqsg
This yr 1 arts class got 3 guys !,btohqsg
my og had someone from arts,btohqsg
A3 has the most guys relative,btohqsg
I still rmb when yijc used to have h1 cse .....,btohqsg
And then someone told me it got removed,btohqsg
A301 was HELm  A302 was GELm A303 was HEGm,btohqsg
iirc the tsd in my batch was A202,btohqsg
i remembered A201 got H1 phy but that is all i know,btohqsg
a101 has h1 chem/bio/phy/geo/econs/hist/elit in the same period,btohqsg
I unironically had a stroke when I see the h1,btohqsg
i wonder if h1 phy more now,btohqsg
i can't imagine being part of the timetable committee man,btohqsg
what is the longest break for a class,btohqsg
"Do you guys have like a ""talent development programme"" kind of students",btohqsg
I don't rly talk abt it tho,btohqsg
Thereâ€™s an moe one for some subjects  some is by the sch,btohqsg
Ya is perfectly fine  I am one of those ppl for my jc lol,btohqsg
So yours is a sch one or moe one,btohqsg
I not smart enuf for the Moe shit,btohqsg
But end up i score below 80 harh har harh,btohqsg
You make a deal with the tutor,btohqsg
Put their class onto the break,btohqsg
longest i've seen is 2 hour,btohqsg
Legit leh I did that for mt-pw intensive,btohqsg
but my class some ppl have,btohqsg
Then my friends were like  why you doing compo now?,btohqsg
bc they don't take h1 cl/ml/tl,btohqsg
Then i said  my mt cher said if i finish my mt compo  i can go home early,btohqsg
Oh maybe some schs they have a more broad category for their own TDP,btohqsg
And then start asking their own mt tutor,btohqsg
So they ask me my passion,btohqsg
bro idt tdp got extra shirt pls,btohqsg
My friends write abt shit like,btohqsg
Chey I thought you talking about your schâ€™s Econs,btohqsg
i thought i was passionate in maths then some of my fm classmates make me feel so average,btohqsg
Just wanted to know if you were in the moe geog one,btohqsg
you don't know passion until you see how insane some people are,btohqsg
Well they taught me that 2nd de is the same as quadratic eqn,btohqsg
unless you're one of those too,btohqsg
actually speedruning the syllabus for h2 math,btohqsg
liking math =/= passion for it,btohqsg
I feel like h2 fm is uni math,btohqsg
currently the PCM ppl in my class just finished graphing techniques,btohqsg
then we alr finished transformations+all of vectors,btohqsg
BRO I RMB VECTORS WAS LIKE,btohqsg
So do you know how to use a gc now :D,btohqsg
AND ITS COMING BACK FOR MYE,btohqsg
"Luckily managed to be ok with it by ""visualising"" and ""imagining""",btohqsg
"if i see one more ""line"" and one more ""plane""",btohqsg
h2 vectors is ngl kinda useless,btohqsg
Y'all basically can pon h2 math lect with 0 consequences,btohqsg
Do y'all even have to come for it,btohqsg
we got kicked out of our class h2 math tutorial,btohqsg
so yeah we don't need to go,btohqsg
For a levels i had to use vectors to do optics...,btohqsg
so by right on wednesdays and fridays our first lesson is only at 9am,btohqsg
ok not rlly optics  more of reflection,btohqsg
if only i can report when my first lesson starting â˜ ,btohqsg
OMG BTW 2019 H2 maths alevels paper 2 was a traversty,btohqsg
WHY ARE MY ANS IN WORDSSS,btohqsg
but like the stuff they actually teach us to use in h2 math for vectors,btohqsg
you never really use it ever afterwards,btohqsg
i cannot do 3d visualization for shit,btohqsg
Till this day  i still dont know what are they lmao,btohqsg
one thing i know is that,btohqsg
I thought 2022 was the worst,btohqsg
Havenâ€™t seen that many describe qns in stats before,btohqsg
HOLY FK it can get worseeeee????,btohqsg
Meanwhile my class here having a real nice timetable lmao,btohqsg
my fm tutor seems to think this form for planes is very useless,btohqsg
bruh they all spaced so nicely,btohqsg
they got some award during my year  well deserved,btohqsg
I would love to be in the timetable committee,btohqsg
yea we have  iirc top 10% auto in?,btohqsg
Haha in a way. Yes. But jc1 mye only,btohqsg
my tdp group is still active lol...the ms jane wong still send stuff,btohqsg
i've seen math in english b4,btohqsg
I was invited a day after they introduce evryone LMAOS,btohqsg
They forgot to give me the form for tdp......until the next day....,btohqsg
wait legit? may those that got the prime minister book prize and all that,btohqsg
Oh yea... in the end my pw grp everyone is from tdp.,btohqsg
And we had only 1 A in my pw grp,btohqsg
mine put those at the back,btohqsg
Lelllll why they dont like him :(,btohqsg
different thing completely tho. like yes it's vectors but completely diff  don't have the planes equations shit,btohqsg
They needed one to select people to go to international geog Olympiad,btohqsg
I have a coding quiz on this monday,btohqsg
But i havent studied for coding yet.,btohqsg
is it the data science one,btohqsg
i tot vectors was first topic,btohqsg
Introduction to data science and artificial intel,btohqsg
well it was the first for us but the normal h2 math ppl start with graphing techniques,btohqsg
No cus vectors was a o level clt,btohqsg
So that is why some put as first,btohqsg
But by right graphing techniques is first,btohqsg
Yijc they did graphing technique first,btohqsg
"at first the tutor say ""wait who are the fm students in this class? if you're taking fm yall can leave""",btohqsg
stuff that remains unchanged under linear transformation  which is a useful property for time dependency all those,btohqsg
then my friend decide to stay in there,btohqsg
tell me more that is my paper lol,btohqsg
later on we see him walking out then he say he got kicked out,btohqsg
tbh there was this one qns that i dun even understand what the qns asking lmao,btohqsg
do yall still have finals for this,btohqsg
Yea it killed the j2 cohort anyways,btohqsg
I think is called open laptop now,btohqsg
my year that mod was damn stupid,btohqsg
"""You can access your notes via laptop/tablet as softcopy/hardcopy""",btohqsg
yea tbh my timetable very nice,btohqsg
assignments  a project  then we had a handwritten final for code,btohqsg
it's so stupid to do that,btohqsg
kuro it was the final i had where i was near the pillar,btohqsg
lol no phone but can use laptop?,btohqsg
How dare they make us have 1 h for 15 mcq and NOT LEAVE the exam hall,btohqsg
not like tele desktop doesn't exist,btohqsg
oh i remembered i was suddenly added to the group  they didnt realy tell us beforehand...coz i failed the j1 intv lol,btohqsg
might as well create a google doc to collab,btohqsg
Oh lol they add u in the grp and just left you there ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
for legal reasons i'm not advocating for it,btohqsg
Yea... that is why i use microsoft onedrive :D,btohqsg
same here and im giving no shit,btohqsg
Wait so what like they left you in the grp and told you guys you failed the interview uh,btohqsg
"Like ""haha sorry you failed the interview  but i hope this grp will make you guys bond with trauma~ ðŸ˜˜ bye!""",btohqsg
??? i remembered it was the first thing they went through,btohqsg
but wyatt can't SU the mod :(,btohqsg
huh i dun remember this happening,btohqsg
true  not like you need the SU anyway,btohqsg
So it will be like finals,btohqsg
They be like cc7 all over again,btohqsg
but i think they intro afterwards but it was just in messaging,btohqsg
They made us draw......on the qn paper,btohqsg
no no...the interview was to get in j1. In J2  all who in top 10% they added us in to TDP,btohqsg
bruh i think it is just YI,btohqsg
Wait so you guys get fulscap???,btohqsg
THEN WHY DID THEY MAKE US WRITE WORKING ON A BOOKLET LMAOS,btohqsg
no like the answer is answer booklet what,btohqsg
Btw my alevels was in 2019,btohqsg
But the answer booklet inside got qns tho,btohqsg
wait how did u draw graph without graphing paper,btohqsg
Inside the qn paper got graph,btohqsg
i think this year vectors is in may,btohqsg
after march hols we going to move on to sequences and series alr,btohqsg
sequences and series i remembered learning those quite late,btohqsg
ya they want to speedrun enough h2 math topics that we have foundation for fmath alr,btohqsg
first fmath topic maybe recurrence relations,btohqsg
Wait so Ur fmath tutorials now is just,btohqsg
Like the qn paper was an answer bookelt for h2 maths tho,btohqsg
the only fm part we learnt is relationship between 3 planes,btohqsg
is mr vanson lim still in tm,btohqsg
this is kinda useless too ngl,btohqsg
u find cartesian eqn of 3 planes then solve simult eqns,btohqsg
then can sleep during h2 math?,btohqsg
The math tutor kick the fmath ppl out,btohqsg
we don't even go for h2 math lol,btohqsg
i searched thru my story archive for this,btohqsg
so just 3 subjects for y'all?,btohqsg
mr lim say the fmath kids are actl very pampered compared to the h2 math kids,btohqsg
Wait so your H2 Maths Alevel qn paper/answer booklet does not look like this?^,btohqsg
h2 math ppl got some independent learning thing,btohqsg
watch lecture online then highlight notes,btohqsg
then fm they nice enough to give us classroom setting and go through everything bit by bit,btohqsg
i dun write answers tgt with the question,btohqsg
so he say we are rlly very lucky lol,btohqsg
i will be so damn distracted,btohqsg
meanwhile my bro have 0 live lectures but at the same time i dun see him watching his lectures,btohqsg
mine was like the normal school exam style leh,btohqsg
Silva and his fire emergency alarms.,btohqsg
i remembered writing my answers on foolscap,btohqsg
i tot A level is standard,btohqsg
"""Oh i made every sch have the lightning alert..."" k can we know",btohqsg
but i remember that math have some english questions,btohqsg
like i cant understand one of the stats question,btohqsg
Luckily i got A for H2 Maths sia,btohqsg
Else I cmi when i go physics sia,btohqsg
idk how did A appear lol,btohqsg
i counted 30m lost each for both p1 and p2,btohqsg
I still rmb swinging pendulums until the other pendulum,btohqsg
physics is pendulum counting  or being amateur electrician,btohqsg
I rmb my physics experiments involve sparks :D,btohqsg
how has the topic suddenly changed all of a sudden,btohqsg
I hated that jc physics experiment,btohqsg
jc physics lab was damn boring,btohqsg
i felt like i'd fall asleep watching the pendulum,btohqsg
i hate chem experiment  esp titration,btohqsg
chem was fun tho the experiments,btohqsg
H2 Chem need memorise all the rxna,btohqsg
oh yea h2 chem the last qns is memorizing game,btohqsg
physics experiments just go in whack only,btohqsg
I had to do 2 diff titrations for A levels,btohqsg
i got D for practical lol in prelims,btohqsg
I still think my B came from practical,btohqsg
h2 chem the last qns is always similar to the prelim  so can memorize the steps,btohqsg
i don't rmb what i got,btohqsg
p sure prac was my best part,btohqsg
In YIJC  no one completes the planning portion for practical,btohqsg
i got D for practical but overall 78%,btohqsg
wat??? that is sort of free marks tho,btohqsg
Like tbh I still dont understand how ppl can sudden complete the entire practical,btohqsg
Thats why gp also like majority of ppl dont write finish one,btohqsg
it is the same as prelim question,btohqsg
coz the school wanna help and choose same topic,btohqsg
Oh for us we dont get to choose,btohqsg
no not we choose  as in the school choses the practical topic,btohqsg
We are the 1h do 3 experiments vers,btohqsg
Ya  we dont get to choose,btohqsg
The sch doesnt choose for you,btohqsg
For a levels is standard for all jcs,btohqsg
Cus we are not under spa,btohqsg
This is your time to explain what is spa,btohqsg
Cus 2017 a level batch onwards no spa anymore,btohqsg
i remembered that last planning qns they say it is same as prelim then can just memorize out,btohqsg
unless the school didnt help la...,btohqsg
You still need to draw out the diagram and all,btohqsg
but it is almost entirely the same tho,btohqsg
Why your a levels damn weird weird one ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
So we cannot choose the experiments uh,btohqsg
u mean we or the schools,btohqsg
The schs and us cannot choose,btohqsg
for like 10 years in 2006ish to 2016 there was this thing called school-based practical assessment (SPA),btohqsg
so your practical was spread across multiple tests by the school,btohqsg
but i was pretty sure my prelim's planning qns is the same as my A level planning qns and it was openly announced,btohqsg
either you misremember or your sch basically cheated...,btohqsg
huh cant be my school cheated leh,btohqsg
but i was pretty sure it was the same...like very similar,btohqsg
i mean if they legit openly announce the question is the same  it's illegal,btohqsg
bc it's standardised across the cohort,btohqsg
Yea they actually cannot do that eh,btohqsg
i cant remember where i heard from but i got to know,btohqsg
otherwise how can the reddit people every year complain about the same thing,btohqsg
Oh but speaking of cheating hor,btohqsg
oh yea wyatt yk my prof was part of MOE last time then he said they basically realised SPA was stupid from the start  but they had to wait for the guy that pushed for it to leave before they can say it's stupid and change it back,btohqsg
I actually had a yijc friend cheated for o levels cus invigilator was playing on his phone.,btohqsg
Plus he was like dyslexic so he was placed in the special case room,btohqsg
Idk i just sudden rmb but i know they did it quietly,btohqsg
Is it invigilator play phone or invigilator sleeping...idk,btohqsg
im very confused now regarding the practical shit,btohqsg
like damn telling you about it is lowk a bad idea,btohqsg
i remembered o lvls it was the same too sia,btohqsg
So the invigilator got reported lol,btohqsg
then did he get into trouble,btohqsg
i'll be a better invigilator for midterms,btohqsg
Cus our batch still have o level spa,btohqsg
A level spa is removed when we first enter jc,btohqsg
but only the planning qns was same,btohqsg
you can think of spa being kinda like pw where it's administered and graded by the sch,btohqsg
A levels  spa was removed in 2016 so for us no spa,btohqsg
then now it's just one paper graded by a separate body,btohqsg
Anyways i gonna mug for qm lol,btohqsg
for y'all the planning qns is not same ah,btohqsg
not sure what magic your schs did sia,btohqsg
mine was spa era so can't comment,btohqsg
the screenshot is based on how it was last time,btohqsg
so for o levels it was like across 2 years of practicals,btohqsg
was o lvl supposed to be same as prelims too,btohqsg
i remembered someone saying the schools have a few topics to choose from,btohqsg
and it was same as prelims,btohqsg
this is the spa format sorta,btohqsg
but it was not spa tho,btohqsg
oh wait i misinterpreted what u sent earlier and tot it wasnt spa,btohqsg
oh ok  but yea it'd make sense for o levels why the sch could tell you the qns bc they choose it,btohqsg
i just memorize my prelim answer keys,btohqsg
my chem tutor told me to focus on my theory coz it was much better than the practical,btohqsg
I think is ri or hci,btohqsg
my school's planning qns was the same,btohqsg
All i rmb was rumors that someone stripped during h2 econs a levels in yijc,btohqsg
coz the planning qns was the same,btohqsg
H2 econs paper 2 cus last paprr,btohqsg
i tot the mcqs are the last?,btohqsg
my school we know what will come out,btohqsg
the school purposely set the prelim qns very similar to the o lvl,btohqsg
in an indirect way  coz it was in the form of them setting similar qns for prelims,btohqsg
2018 practical is worser than spa,btohqsg
Cus spa you can do in 3 seperate days,btohqsg
So each exp will be likely 1h,btohqsg
i heard last yr o levels never came out titration in so so so long,btohqsg
2018 practical is literally everything do in 1 day,btohqsg
i remembered my phy pract was easy,btohqsg
I know they got put b4 lollll,btohqsg
i remembered forgetting to close the burette tap,btohqsg
and then the cher stared at me coz i was in front row,btohqsg
then came to me with a whole stack of toilet paper,btohqsg
I rmb my teacher say i almost burn down the lab for o levels,btohqsg
And i rmb for jc  someone broke a mercury thermometer,btohqsg
oh no hope everything was fine,btohqsg
Mine someone from bio a level spill yeast sample on pants,btohqsg
im here for 3.5h it is time to sleep and start work tmr,btohqsg
i didn't do o levels so can't relate. like i was in spa era without the spa,btohqsg
what is wrong with pulling the thing,btohqsg
i tot it was water lmao,btohqsg
uhh thing is for spa practicals  you wouldn't just have one o level prac. you'd have quite a lot of them,btohqsg
I mrb for a levels I asked the invigilator to off the fans for my side.My friend beside me jokingly ask why I go off the fan cus I made him too hot so he sweated. ðŸ˜‚,btohqsg
wait is it me dementia  i remembered only having the final practical???,btohqsg
i was freezing coz AA room only had < 10 people,btohqsg
national exams are not invigilated by own school,btohqsg
Oh yijc one the invigilator was an ex-yijc teacher LOL,btohqsg
i dun think they care ur roots,btohqsg
by right should be 5 assessments but bc it's up to the sch  maybe they did it their own funny way,btohqsg
For O levels is like 3 each,btohqsg
during one of my A lvl exam the invigilator made a series of farts,btohqsg
2 experiment each + 1 planning each,btohqsg
wait im confused already  these are foreign to me,btohqsg
i only had 1 day leh,btohqsg
by 5 assessments i mean there's 3 assessment components  and 2 of those are done twice,btohqsg
so how your sch does it is gonna vary,btohqsg
it can't be just one experiment tho,btohqsg
maybe it is just my school with its funny ways,btohqsg
oh i meant i only had 1 practical exam  but w i forgot how many qns,btohqsg
some schools i know have like 1 in sec 3  rest in sec 4,btohqsg
maybe my school bunch them all in 1 setting,btohqsg
why do you think my prof was saying how stupid it was,btohqsg
they probs realised it was stupid before 2010 but the guy need to fuck off first,btohqsg
today i learnt that my schools does things funnily???,btohqsg
"""SPA will take place over an appropriate period that the candidates are offering the subject"" so in theory can test anytime from sec 3 to 4",btohqsg
just one practical test for 20% of the grade,btohqsg
looks like the same things i did for As tbh,btohqsg
i mean for A levels you're just graded based on your answers,btohqsg
the SPA lets teachers evaluate even how you do the experiment,btohqsg
oh right i remembered that part,btohqsg
i prob got B3 for chem due to the practical,btohqsg
so it was stupid bc imagine getting on your teachers bad side,btohqsg
and they just make up stuff to mark you down,btohqsg
coz my chem was always higher than my phy,btohqsg
true  they should maybe let another cher come in,btohqsg
yea so no surprise that the system was scrapped,btohqsg
i forgot to close the tap of the burette and everything spilled onto the chair,btohqsg
that is why never be in ur chers bad books,btohqsg
it's also dumb imo to be marked down for stuff like that bc accidents happen,btohqsg
"i rmb some sites literally say ""be good friends with your teachers if possible""",btohqsg
my cher stared at me and came to me was like 'aiyo  na' --> came to me w a toilet roll,btohqsg
wow...i think it is impossible for me,btohqsg
especially till now im still the quiet and shy type,btohqsg
just that in jc i spoke more else the tutor will be talking to the wall,btohqsg
sometimes i asked myself am i too much  but when i dont talk  the classroom is quiet,btohqsg
ngl that's a very sg thing,btohqsg
the keep quiet in class part,btohqsg
I do that in uni lectures :D  not much in uni tutorials,btohqsg
Our lts are very small in spms :D,btohqsg
yea that one depends on your cohort,btohqsg
i am my team's spokesperson lol coz 2 people in my group dun give any shit  the other 2 are quiet and dun speak up,btohqsg
hmm it's more common for them still to ask after class and not respond during the lesson itself,btohqsg
i remembered in y2 there was a zoom lesson  and it was at 2pm  then i was a bit late coz went to grab lunch...then i did not expect my grp to be called first  then when i went back up  i see someone messaging us where are we instead of answering lol,btohqsg
then just silence the prof lmao,btohqsg
ig bc you have groupings for tutorials. i hardly had anything like that,btohqsg
i got a bit of a shock in a good way when i went for my postgrad lectures,btohqsg
bc everyone was way more responsive and enthu  asking questions  interacting with the prof,btohqsg
sometimes even figuring out mistakes tgt bc it's higher level stuff,btohqsg
i got back in time but i cant answer coz i missed the entire presentation from the other grp so cannot make comments / feedbacks,btohqsg
for me we only had zoom stuff for lectures which we never really had to speak much. only unmute to ask questions,btohqsg
we had 4 tutorial groups and i dun trust them in saying it is randomized,btohqsg
tutorials were small batches so we can still continue as usual,btohqsg
coz the more smart / outspoken people are in T4,btohqsg
if it is randomized  cant be nice nice T1 is absolutely quiet  T4 is absolutely noisy,btohqsg
i think my entire undergrad i only had one grouping that was randomised,btohqsg
School even does subject banding among express students and NA students ðŸ¤¯,btohqsg
So if your physics teacher hate you  they will pull you down?,btohqsg
like after reporting her to principal,btohqsg
and the teacher will hate the child because his parents report her ?,btohqsg
those that likes talk behind student back in one gossip group,btohqsg
ive only ever had one prof that iâ€™d consider bad,btohqsg
but its not even the teaching issue,btohqsg
heâ€™s just a pain in the ass,btohqsg
the profs also look more enthusiastic in teaching,btohqsg
bc itâ€™s not so trivial ig to them,btohqsg
and itâ€™s sometimes more like a discussion,btohqsg
the prof i didnâ€™t like in undergrad was a pain just bc heâ€™s annoying to reason with,btohqsg
and heâ€™s like an assistant chair for acads in my faculty,btohqsg
so we gotta deal with him for lots of things like overloading,btohqsg
students grouped for every subject according to their grade in that subject ...,btohqsg
Eh no leh my parents reporter my pw tutor and i think they actually cared,btohqsg
Yes coz my tutor know he being complainedðŸ˜¢,btohqsg
My econs cher openly told me i was always a topic in the staff room lmao,btohqsg
I doubt it is that coz the papers hv no identification markersâ€¦the only thing they see is ur matric nunmber,btohqsg
I had many prof that cant teach for god sake,btohqsg
I think it is 2 separate modules but bruh my pharm lectures are always so noisy  sometimes i cant hear the prof coz others is talking  but the prof didnt step in lol.This is so idk how to describe already  i think she/he will confirm kena one,btohqsg
I wanted to ask this on the reddit but im sure it wouldnt get as much attention as the r/s post so I'll ask here,btohqsg
Anyone from NTU biosci / NUS life sci1. how is the workload like for these courses2. I am interested in zoology and I heard that NUS life sciences has zoology mods. What are some examples of contents in these mods,btohqsg
Actually I am talking about false rumours :),btohqsg
hi iâ€™m a y1 nus life sci student,btohqsg
1. workload wiseiâ€™ve only done/ doing 4 life sci mods so far  being the intro  molecular biology  evolution  and biodiversity. first 3 are mandatory mods for all life sci students to clear while biodiversity is ur choice. the workload is not that much eg thereâ€™s no alot of assignments etc but more focus on learning content and concepts and the exams largely test applications of said concepts via mcq/ mrq  with a few exceptions so hardly any memorisation (yay)most tend to be open book as well but so far interest has carried for me so it doesnâ€™t seem tough yet. for nus since lifesci is under chs u also need to clear ur chs mods so there are those but workload is not too overwhelming and if u really cannot score for them u have S/Us to use2. so lifesci has 2 forms of specialisation  being either biomed and cell biology or ecology and evolution. so itâ€™s not zoology per se but thereâ€™s many mods around it  and personally i too am specialising in the ecology evolution branch. thereâ€™s some minors u can do too like aquatic ecology which also play into the zoology ish side. thereâ€™s many fun mods to do like biology  ecology  entomology  avian studies  aquatic vertebrate diversity  aquatic invertebrate diversity  animal behaviour  environment bioacoustics etc but u can ultimately pick and choose which ones u want to do as well,btohqsg
any other qns can just ask,btohqsg
a bit random but what do life sci majors usually do after grad,btohqsg
personally i wanna be a teacheri heard that alot life sci majors dont do bio related jobs after grad though,btohqsg
i honestly am pursuing for my own interest  but tbh a lot of ppl in the workforce dh a job relating to ur degree. to my understanding u can either go to the teaching path  the research path or even just doing like lab assistant things after grad/ work at nparks to help w bio conservation efforts in singapore etc,btohqsg
yea i did actl consider working at nparks or the zoo  other than teaching because i really like animals too,btohqsg
i like animals and young children alot for some reason,btohqsg
You can also consider talking to the ECG team in your school  find out during Uni Open Houses  when uni admissions officers drop by your school for higher ed fair  etc,btohqsg
yes i will be doing that during my school cshe fair. Last year i spoke to the moe ppl about scholarships,btohqsg
i know someone that is doing a PGDE after finishing ntu biological science,btohqsg
Idk why did i apply ntu biomedical science (for the sake of it) lmao,btohqsg
Then i only look at the course structure after i applied (like wth the WHOLE course is mainly just bioðŸ¤£),btohqsg
I see. If you thinking of pursuing a career in education  you may also want to find out about other work within MOE that are not about being a teacherIf you are interested in animals/conversation work  you can read more about this cool dude Cedric Tan:https://conbio.org/publications/scb-news-blog/dr-cedric-tan-wins-asia-section-awardHe did his undergraduate studies in NUS before completing his PhD in Oxford and now doing really good work in his field. If my memories serve me right  his alma mater is DHS (and HCJC),btohqsg
thank you !! he is from dhs too i see ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„,btohqsg
how small is the RVHS JAE intake,btohqsg
Iirc. Itâ€™s been too many years and I cannot remember where every of my batchmates are from haha,btohqsg
wait you are my senpai too ?? ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜†,btohqsg
Nope. He and I were batchmates in NUS,btohqsg
Btw i realised A201 and 202 has got H2 math?? And A201 has H1 phy (means they hv mix combi and i predict is a 3 arts stream with H2 sci or hybrid with 2H2 arts),btohqsg
yeah our batches A1 & A2 classes got ppl take h2 math,btohqsg
what are ur thoughts on philosophy/history/ econs/anthropology/linguisticsmajor in uni?,btohqsg
i have engineering friends who are inteachingbankinginsurancepropertyIRASMOMand one in business creating beauty products,btohqsg
