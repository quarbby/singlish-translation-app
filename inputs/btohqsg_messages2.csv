Hi  i just joined. new here,btohqsg
wld like to ask  I got a Q number for amk n will select a flat unit. but my HLE gt rejected cos I currently staying in my resale flat  mop 2.5yrs more to complete.,btohqsg
U need to finish mop b4 u can buy another hse,btohqsg
I ask hdb agent they say can go select unit without hle. can I confirm if this is correct,btohqsg
ya but mop completed by the time bto is built,btohqsg
U need complete mop b4 u allow to buy another hse whether u get grant anot.hdb change the rule some years back,btohqsg
Maybe you call hdb hotline to ask? Haha. Or maybe see anyone else know the ans haha,btohqsg
I ask leh. she say can select unit,btohqsg
If u don't have hle u not allow to book a flat,btohqsg
He has to complete the MOP then only can apply,btohqsg
Hi allMay I know anyone here applied for Canberra eastglen,btohqsg
I think if no hle means cannot take housing loan,btohqsg
lol then why I still gt queue number sia..,btohqsg
Wow They know better if they say can then can,btohqsg
But how‚Äôs your queue number ? Is it short or looks like end number ?,btohqsg
I think they allow u to apply but when appointment u maybe cannot choose flat,btohqsg
Cos I quite sure you need to finish ur MOP b4 u are allow to buy a new bto,btohqsg
But his queue number is less than 100 then definitely he will get it,btohqsg
okok nvm thanks guys  I call HDB ba!,btohqsg
Good #  4 or 5 room?,btohqsg
Cos my case is I nvr taken grant for my resale,btohqsg
Plus they changed the ruling in 2019  but my resale flat bought in 2018,btohqsg
so I'm not affected by the new ruling,btohqsg
Kebun Baru Edge BTO 2020(formerly known as Mayflower BTO 2020)üèòOpen discussion group for the upcoming Ang Mo Kio BTO 2020üèòFeel free to join  ask  share and discuss information  tips  news  etc.üèóHDB Sales Launch: August 2020https://t.me/mayflowerBTO2020,btohqsg
hi  how do i check if my hle is approved? i applied on sunday 28 sep and on the acknowledgement page ‚Äúhle approved date‚Äù is 28 sep the moment details were completed and submitted.i received a sms yesterday saying that the hle application is being processed and we can check on myhdb page but when i enter the page i have to input hle application number which im not sure where to retrieve that information,btohqsg
i think they will send you an email when approved!,btohqsg
You can only opt for BTO only when the MOP is met,btohqsg
thank you for your reply. i hv contacted and clarified with hdb:),btohqsg
Wasted I know but too bad,btohqsg
Queue number will still get but when u go house selection they give u within 1 month to approve ur hle ... if u book flat already but hle not approve within month the ur deposits burn that is what happen to me on November ... so I didn‚Äôt book the flat,btohqsg
If not I take the nov 19 for tengah but I go hdb they said is risky to book flat wo hle so I decide to cancel n waet for Aug,btohqsg
Wah this is a good info. But just wanna ask how long usually HLE will take to approve? It seems like it will take more than a month.,btohqsg
mine took about slightly more than a week,btohqsg
I see. Seems fast. May I ask when did you apply? Once you got notified on the queue number that is fall within cohort?,btohqsg
i think i applied around mid-sept,btohqsg
we got the Q around start of sept or something if i remember correctly,btohqsg
Okie thanks. Looks like I can apply later because my queue was fall out of the cohort.,btohqsg
Ahh I see. All the best!,btohqsg
Ya .... as long as when you bought  your resale flat  you never take cpf housing grant  no need to wait for MOP  can apply for BTO as long as the DPD is on or after the last month of MOP. As HLE application there must be a reason why it was rejected. Just no HLE cannot get HDB loan,btohqsg
Yesterday I called HDB but she didn‚Äôt say about resale grants üßê,btohqsg

Wah Keat Hong n kebun baru select already ?,btohqsg
For tengah parc resident is nov,btohqsg
Toa Payoh Ridge still have available unit?,btohqsg
Or u got queue number de,btohqsg
I just get citizen application approve,btohqsg
Looking for BTO or resales unit,btohqsg
Wait so ur a new citizen,btohqsg
Then I think you need to apply at hdb first for a queue number :),btohqsg
In order to book the flat,btohqsg
Date selected is mean already reserve?,btohqsg
Ya date selected is ppl take liao,btohqsg
Available units is at the main page.. here,btohqsg
"Go down see the table ""estimated available units""",btohqsg
Can we change job after select unit ? Cause I heard there‚Äôs household income up to 80k we we already work more then 1 year ... after we received the grant are we allow to Change job ?,btohqsg
Ur grant is only calculated at the time of ur bto application.the grant amount will nv change,btohqsg
So ur advice is after house selection can change job already ?,btohqsg
Sorry cause nov is my 1st time apply house so I wanna ask house selection then they will tell us what grant we get is it ?,btohqsg
There is only one grant EHG which is calculated 12 mths prior to the time of ur bto application and to be eligible for this one partner have to work at least 12 mths to be eligible.So it does not matter if u change job as long is continuously,btohqsg
U can check how much u can get from this,btohqsg

Hi admin just wanted to share for tampines greencourt the first batch for key collection will be 2021.the percentage show is for the first batch of flats that will be ready nxt yr,btohqsg
May I know how much does a 5rm flat in amk costs at 29th storey...... just curious,btohqsg
But who knows how the market valuation will be years down the road.,btohqsg
confirm at least 200k profit across every mature estate,btohqsg
but I don't see the hoo-ha since none of the units is facing the reservoir,btohqsg
I don't see pasir ris anywhere,btohqsg
the gap between 3 and 4rm so big,btohqsg
If i not wrong for woodlands based on the article i read when HDB resale prices fall in Woodlands  BTO prices would increase. And if resale prices increase  BTO prices would increase even faster,btohqsg
This one maybe not all.For tamp I see not much increase for resales as the supply for bto at tamp is alot,btohqsg
Btohq website put 90% but saw families collect keys already. Never update one. Other projects at least 5-7% ahead than listed on website.,btohqsg
those blocks are finished can collect keys first  some blocks not finished yet  tink dey release in batches  shud be almost done,btohqsg
Yup correct.they don't do it in one shot one but for greenbloom only 3 blks I think,btohqsg
Yeah  and now there's the covid19 construction delay  so the whole project might not be completed yet. Releasing batch by batch. It's just an estimation though! üëçüòä,btohqsg
Like wat from the btohq website it just a estimated percentage.u can check from ur hdb website or go down to the site n have a look,btohqsg

No.. nothing to do with this.. what i mean is.. u can call any insurance agent frm NTUC.. Great Eastern.. Prudential.. and tell them u interested to buy insurance or growth policy using CPF ordinary account. U can invest any amount from ur ordinary account.. 20K or 30K is enough to invest usually.. then they will deduct the amount frm ur CPF ordinary.. so in future if u really need the money back to ur ordinary account.. just cancel the policy and the money will return back with whatever interest or dividends they give u.. but if u dont need the money.. leave the policy active,btohqsg
You mean you want to deduct ur cpf so the hdb wont deduct so much ah???,btohqsg

Hi didn‚Äôt receive any updates on SBF happening today,btohqsg

Yea i know. But maybe i will be nearer to the last one?,btohqsg
there are still some empty plots in punggol,btohqsg

Hdb officer so good now? Will tell date le ah,btohqsg
Haha I asked the lady at the counter üòõ,btohqsg

Hi just wondering you wont know which project the sales of balance flat is? They only indicate location?,btohqsg
Comparison with similar locations. Doesn't cheap compared to resale with the additional grants for resale,btohqsg
I only know roughly got Dakota breeze and line Vista,btohqsg
Where can i get the project location? :/,btohqsg
I cant seem to find it,btohqsg
Does anybody know why the price range for 4 room flats is more than 100k difference?,btohqsg
It‚Äôs in the drop down menu. Click on the town you are looking at  there‚Äôs another drop down menu below it,btohqsg
For the sales of balance flat,btohqsg
But it seem to not be loading,btohqsg
If my application have some error can I edit n counter sign ?,btohqsg
hdb login kept hitting 502. lol,btohqsg
just click on the project you want,btohqsg
i was trying to login to see my stuff inside. lol,btohqsg
Anyone knows of the exact locations for the sale of balance flats so I know when the estimated TOP is?,btohqsg
ive seen that one but it doesnt show which estate exactly. e.g. tampines has 5 estates with TOP ranging from2021-2023.,btohqsg
Use desktop or laptop to view will be better. Then you can click flats availability. More details will be shown there such as unit numbers  maps etc.,btohqsg
Look at the flat details tab,btohqsg
Has anyone applied for the Tengah BTO offered in the current sales launch? I wonder what‚Äôs the TOP for that...,btohqsg
What if gotta a date to select flat for Aug launch but prefer to go for nov sales of balance? Still eligible?,btohqsg
Meaning if I didn‚Äôt select the flat in August BTO launch. I still can apply for the SBF in nov launch?,btohqsg
But how many times have you previously rejected ?,btohqsg
Aug BTO launch was my first time.,btohqsg
Okay  so you‚Äôre a 2nd timer upon applying for the SBF.,btohqsg
It will be 2nd timer for SBF?,btohqsg
it's only after rejected the appointment twice  then will auto become 2nd timer for a year,btohqsg
Shld be still first timer. There is two chances,btohqsg
Glitches on HDB‚Äôs website on sale of BTO flats launch day  work in progress to resolve issuesThe Housing and Development Board (HDB) said that applicants with unsuccessful payment records or those who did not receive any confirmation email ‚Äúare advised to try again later‚Äù.HDB stressed that the sales exercise is ‚Äúon for a week‚Äù and interested buyers may submit their applications before 11.59pm on Nov 23.‚û°Ô∏èhttps://tdy.sg/3lI6GBq@todayonlinesg,btohqsg
im getting a lot of instances of '502 Bad Gateway: Your request has been received  but there is no valid response from the server.' what can i do about this?,btohqsg
Yea. Their server overwhelmed i guess,btohqsg
Took me 2 hrs to complete the application üòÇ,btohqsg
Anyone here knows about HLE? Can it be extended or if expire only can reapply?,btohqsg
Yea mine expired but extended due to covid till end of this mth only,btohqsg
Hi i am currently still waiting to see if my number will be called for the previous bto exercise as its bigger than available units. Am i able to ballot for the current SBF as well?,btohqsg
Anyone got updated  to the construction progress  for jewel bto  at jurong  west?,btohqsg
Can see for sbf flats as well?,btohqsg
Does anyone have development update on the Canberra Vista,btohqsg
Is it possible for me to ballot for both sales of balance flats and a BTO flat for this launch? Or only one choice? üòÖ,btohqsg
haha no prob. I had the same dilemma,btohqsg
Any idea when Urbanville will enter SBF?,btohqsg
Where to check the progress of current BTO,btohqsg
see whether can you wait for 7 years despite 95% chance for first timers,btohqsg
or decide it upon checking the application rate status on 23rd Nov  11pm,btohqsg
then do calculation on your finance since waiting time for SBF is much much faster,btohqsg
example do you want to BTO for bidadari and wait 7 years (95% chance and can slowly build up your $) or wait for SBF (much Lower chance but wait for 7 months and need to have ample of savings to tank the payment),btohqsg
Biddari bto waiting time is 7 years ?,btohqsg
I mean in general for recent BTO launches due to covid,btohqsg
Any idea how to check how long will the bto I want to apply for takes to build ?,btohqsg
How to go to this page ?,btohqsg
Sian sia my birthday was the day right after the end of Aug bto Exercise,btohqsg
No ah. 3 or 4rm depending on $$$,btohqsg
My family is renting HDB from HDB. So i can bto without getting married.,btohqsg
Thanks ! Wanna know when will sbf be out for Feb 2021 launch?,btohqsg
Wait u want to sbf for something that hasnt even come out?,btohqsg
What I understand was sbf will be twice a year - May/Nov. If you are asking when bto will launch in Feb 2021  then you may wanna monitor during Feb because sales launch release date will varies across different years.,btohqsg
Morning everyone! Is it true that 95% of flats in mature estates is given to first time applicants?,btohqsg
So for bishan 4 room flats  1160 out of 1222 flats go to first time applicants?,btohqsg
I‚Äôm wondering if I should look at first time applicants subscription rate or the overall subscription rate üßê,btohqsg
u should just apply 1st ><,btohqsg
Thinking if we should apply 3 or 4 room for better chances üòÖ,btohqsg
but is it big enough for you?,btohqsg
especially you have more than one kid,btohqsg
4rm is always the hottest fav every BTO launch,btohqsg
I have a mother and a brother  can apply for 4rm using public scheme or i can only follow my Tenant Priority Scheme ah,btohqsg
Sbf 5rm Clementi can be 800k over - madness. 20 min walk from mrt some more,btohqsg
just curiousis SBF price higher than BTO?,btohqsg
you can refer to the application status of AMK the previous launch,btohqsg
Hi guys... please help... i have already applied for the NOV BTO but I just realized I am eligible for the MCPS ... how do i edit my application? ... thank you..,btohqsg
Is there a way that I can contact the HDB to do it without cancelling?,btohqsg
Click apply online > amend particulars,btohqsg
sorry ah@rachelghw  didn't mean to be a troll,btohqsg
Tried!! Thank you so much üòä,btohqsg
I guess it has to be main applicant .... i am not the main applicant,btohqsg
Mother in law? Have anot hahahaha,btohqsg
So I guess I am not eligible for it?,btohqsg
She doesnt stay near the new flat üòÇ,btohqsg
Maybe u call hdb yo clarify this,btohqsg
oh ask your mum to log in sing pass and you amend for her together?,btohqsg
either you cancel the application  or you apply without the scheme,btohqsg
No worries guys  thank you so much for helping. ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
"It has to have a Father's details too otherwise they wont allow to move to the next page. Ive only a step father so can't apply as selection has no ""step father""",btohqsg
as long as the proximity is within 4km you can apply for MCPS,btohqsg
It doesnt allow me to go to the next page though,btohqsg
Will have to have a biological father details,btohqsg
cannot put your step dad's details?,btohqsg
It's okay! I will do without it  thank you so much!,btohqsg
Hope u get good queue number,btohqsg
why not call up hdb and ask,btohqsg
MCPS adds up your chance to get better number,btohqsg
Tried to call them this morning but kept saying high volume..,btohqsg
need to keep trying every half an hour. my husband managed to call in twice yesterday üòÖ the officer recommend to call because email response rate could be slower than usual,btohqsg
Got it! Thank you very much guys ‚ò∫Ô∏è,btohqsg
If take high floor is it true our hle doesn‚Äôt cover the higher level we take ?,btohqsg
depends on the amount of loan disburse to you based on your combined income,btohqsg
Ex : I‚Äôm taking last floor unit .... the cost of the house is 247k they will offset from my loan rite ?,btohqsg
example if the house is $600k  your HLE of $400k and deposit 10% $60k plus misc fee at $15k max  you'll need $125k of shortfall to eligible for the key collections  otherwise you have to cough up the money by hook or crooknot forgetting expenses on reno/appliances/furniture  say $50kand if you're not married  another $50k for wedding expenses,btohqsg
Cause someone told me that if I‚Äôm taking higher level my loan doesn‚Äôt cover my level,btohqsg
don't know have i answered your question  but I shall save that as a template lol,btohqsg
So if my HLE is not enough to cover the remaining 90% of the price of my house  I will need to pay the outstanding upfront? During signing of lease or collection of keys?,btohqsg
of course you must make sure both of your OA are enough for the 10% deposit during 2nd appointment aka signing of LOa,btohqsg
unless any of you is below 30  only 5%,btohqsg
.oh no wonder something is missing,btohqsg
you'll need to put back the money into your OA upon selling the house  plus accrued interest,btohqsg
the grant can be offset the 5%/10% deposit,btohqsg
Hi everyone  got a question. We‚Äôre able to collect our keys upon 90% completion right?,btohqsg
is it always best to get max years of loan from HDB?,btohqsg
Q:Will the keys be issued only when the entire precinct is completed?A:Keys to each block will be handed over once works on the block are completed. Keys will be issued on a block by block basis.,btohqsg
Q:Will we be collecting keys in the month of the Probable Completion Date?A:Key collection will be scheduled progressively for the flat buyers about two weeks after the actual completion of the block of flats. Hence  if the block is handed over to the HDB in the early part of the month  you will likely collect the keys in that month. Otherwise  key collection will begin in the following month.,btohqsg
CPF 2.5% interest  if you can get better interest rate through CPF investment  getting max loan period is better,btohqsg
but the accrued interest is compounding at the same time  it won't stop even if you have cleared your loan till you put it back,btohqsg
someone correct me if I am wrong,btohqsg
because bank loan is not as stable and compassionate as HDB,btohqsg
we are paying the difference in interest rate for stability and unseen uncertainty,btohqsg
I mean if you can tank many years of bank loan given the crisis  why not?,btohqsg
Becus if u late payment one month.. Bank will not hesitate to make u homeless,btohqsg
I heard bank loan low interest,btohqsg
Play safe u can go for hdb,btohqsg
yes definitely  but HDB loan for stability,btohqsg
I believe majority of us do,btohqsg
sian my TOP date pushed back another 2 quarters,btohqsg
means earliest can move in only in one year,btohqsg
for those who want to switch to Bank loan before key collection  you have to service 6 months of HDB loan before you can convert IIRC,btohqsg
and bank imposes a penalty to you if you want to clear the loan ASAP,btohqsg
Never update anything leh.. shud be same.. q2 2021,btohqsg
Can i ask how accurate is this?,btohqsg
I'm at 87% but received email from HDB saying that the TOP has been pushed back another 6 months,btohqsg
Is that ur project? Haha. If yes  if u received any notification of delay from hdb u can contribute n pm to@btohqthe delay üòä haha,btohqsg
Yes thats mine and no so far no news of any delay.,btohqsg
It looks pretty done up already actually so hoping that it can be released before the given date,btohqsg
I also waiting on mine hahaha,btohqsg
anyway I can't imagine the stamp duties for the most exp unit in this launch,btohqsg
1% of first 180k ($1800)2% of next 180k  ($3600)3% of remaining ($10950),btohqsg
10% of $725k =$72500+ OCS $9000+ stamp duties $16350=rounded up a whopping $100k,btohqsg
if both are below 30  good luck man.,btohqsg
hello! I'd like to apply for a 2-room flat in Tengah and see that there are both options for BTO or Sale of Balance Flat. does applying for Sale of Balance flat mean that I would be able to get the flat sooner? I recall that the TOP of the batch released in August 2020 to be2026/2027  but for this new current sales launch batch of Tengah flats  it is actually sooner in 2025?,btohqsg
the batch of tengah flats of this SBF should be from launch years ago,btohqsg
applying for SBF is also through ballot  based on luck just like BTO but you'd have higher chance for the latter,btohqsg
does that mean we can get the flat sooner then?,btohqsg
95% at mature estate if you're first timer,btohqsg
yes sooner as long as your OA can tank the down-payment why not,btohqsg
no one would be advised you,btohqsg
can you wait for 5 years?,btohqsg
Tengah SBF 2-room application rate is low though so I'd think higher chance there?,btohqsg
decide by 10pm on 23rd Nov to have abit of buffer for calculation and such,btohqsg
compare and see how is the application status,btohqsg
Hi  anyone knows how do we know if MCPS is successful?,btohqsg
Thanks all for sharing your thoughts and experiences! Appreciate it.,btohqsg
I've got a question. So we got a queue number from previous open booking but we didn't pick a flat. Would this affect our first timer chance with BTO/SBF exercises?The guidelines are not very clear and because open booking is first come first served so that got us wondering. Appreciate any advices!,btohqsg
Tot MGPS then allocate two ballot?,btohqsg
MCPS is same as public scheme just that addition one chance,btohqsg
I only know for BTO  if you failed to attend the selection exercise despite a date is allocated  you have one more chance before you become a 2nd timer for a year  and if you chut stunt within the time frame  the penalty time adds on another year,btohqsg
This is the confusing part because every sites I read are only quoting BTO/SBF but never mention of open booking.I think open booking doesn't really have the first-timer second-timer status difference so we're quite puzzled üòÖ if I can be lucky enough to get a unit this time round I shall ask HDB out of curiosity haha,btohqsg
maybe because OBF is still new,btohqsg
If not wrong..Open booking should be 1st come 1st serve.The moment it appear in the listing  u need fast finger to apply,btohqsg
Thanks@YuanTheMonsteryou are right and we understand that. The question was  if we gave up on an open booking queue number previously would it affect our first timer priority,btohqsg
eh why the application rate for 3rm geylang SBF is so underwhelming?,btohqsg
can move in anytime for macpherson spring and eunos court,btohqsg
3rm macpherson is $90k cheaper than dakota breeze which is 2 stops away,btohqsg
Nah doubt that  obf is for immediate adhoc buyers open to anyone eligible in principle there‚Äôs no ballot shouldn‚Äôt affect as long as didn‚Äôt book,btohqsg
Awesome thank you! I'm glad hahah,btohqsg
Hi  I have a question. Am I eligible to apply 3 rooms sale of balance flat if my spouse is a foreigner?,btohqsg
Criteria must be one Singaporean and One Singapore Permanent Resident.,btohqsg
unless you have a citizen child,btohqsg
but you still can try for 2rm BTO if you're >35,btohqsg
on a good note  there will be better locations next time when you're eligible  like greater South waterfront,btohqsg
Can I check if i already choose ballot  can I still change other bto location now?,btohqsg
After put up the request to cancel the application  how long does it need to cancel and to submit a new application?,btohqsg
right after you cancel  can just reapply,btohqsg
when will the result for sbf be?,btohqsg
End of december ? So nervous its like taking exam results LOL,btohqsg
Hi  can I check for northshore edge  is it delayed due to Covid?,btohqsg
covid has affected every BTO and condo,btohqsg
How do i count how many first & second timer applicants are there?  üòÖ idk how to count with how the hdb described,btohqsg
i am not sure if this answers your question.,btohqsg
if based on this..best is to tackle 3 room flat?,btohqsg
i got this from HDB website for Nov2020 BTOi think it basically shares the allocation of the units.from what you are saying yeseg:2nd timer units allocation for 3room non-mature is higher as compared to other locations (30% of all available units),btohqsg
I think he meant the application rate,btohqsg
102 units/214applicants of which first timer rate is 1.0 while second timer is 23.4 overall 2.1,btohqsg
if you're first timer  you have a very high chance of getting an unit,btohqsg
^ I built a calculator for my overly anxious husband hahahaha,btohqsg
single can get sbf? thought the criteria same as BTO,btohqsg
In email only say i can apply for up to 3 room non mature estates. Didnt specifically state bto or sbf only so i try my luckü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,btohqsg
the eligibility for applying BTO/SBF should be the same,btohqsg
This was the email i received,btohqsg
So means eligible for sbf too?,btohqsg
Anyone here experience with HLE? If my husband is the purchaser and I'm listed as the occupier - does HDB consider our household income or only my husband's income to decide the loan offer?Asking because we're planning to get a 5-room and financially more than well to afford it but our HLE came back with <$200k loan amount only. I'm a foreigner so I wonder if that's what make this more complicated ü§î appreciate some advice  thank you!,btohqsg
did you work 3 months consecutively? and I assumed you're a PR?,btohqsg
They will only use the owner's income to calculate  in this case  only your husband.Occupier will be excluded.,btohqsg
Yeap worked for years. PR results is still pending,btohqsg
Even with a family cluster? We have a SC son so we thought they factor in household income as the eligibility test result says so üòî,btohqsg
Yes  for loans  all borrowers must be mortgagor.,btohqsg
That's what we thought but you mentioned that HDB only consider my husband's income and not our household income?,btohqsg
Yes  so because owner is your husband  thus he is the mortgagor.Occupier can be added and removed anytime  so not considered,btohqsg
Heh... I read about essential occupier and I'm certainly one.,btohqsg
Okay then in this case  how can we go about appealing for a higher loan estimates? Some advice would be super appreciated,btohqsg
Since I'm yet to be a PR  I reckon I can't be listed as co-owner right,btohqsg
The loan quantum will depend on your husband's income and age,btohqsg
If he takes with banks or financial institution  he can show cash to increase loan amount,btohqsg
This is super helpful!! Really appreciate that you spend the time chatting on this matter üôåüèª,btohqsg
Just trying to help out üòä,btohqsg
your HLE will be reassessed again upon getting keys in years time,btohqsg
unless they reject your application to be a PR  don't think you have problem getting higher loan,btohqsg
We're looking a SBF so key collection is about 1y from now. Not sure if I can have my PR by then leh :(,btohqsg
then in this case  the only way to get higher loan is to wait for the approval to convert PR  then reapply for SBF again,btohqsg
And  can change from occupier to co-owner before key collection is if?,btohqsg
As far I knew once marry mean both are co-owner.,btohqsg
Sien re PR timeline - We're wanting to move out ASAP haha,btohqsg
As foreigner can? If yes then problem solved easily üòÖ,btohqsg
We have a SC son la so that's why we could apply for SBF,btohqsg
Not yet. But the area I picked is not over-subscribed so that's like a unit guaranteed,btohqsg
Need at least one Singaporean to apply HDB,btohqsg
When u submit your HLE it will ask for both income if not wrong.,btohqsg
U can go HLE to read it. Should have some criteria to apply.,btohqsg
Ya we submitted household income but the results came back with only <$200k so we think it's not factored in my income (my husband is SC  I'm foreigner),btohqsg
U can always call up HDB to ask them,btohqsg
No harm to seek opinion from banks  maybe they can assist,btohqsg
Alright! Probably should try to have my PR obtained before key collection then,btohqsg
can BTO/SBF using your husband and your SC son's name,btohqsg
No worry the HLE is just a guideline. Everything still depend when collection of key.,btohqsg
non citizen spouse scheme can only apply resale or 2rm flexi,btohqsg
Ya we're doing this listing my son as occupier so we can form a family cluster,btohqsg
as long as your son is not co-owner,btohqsg
Confirm no. Need at least 18 or 21 years.,btohqsg
public scheme which you can apply for any size of BTO,btohqsg
You may not need to be restricted to the Non-Citizen Spouse Scheme if you have a child with your foreign spouse. If the child is Singaporean or SPR  you can form a family nucleus (including your foreign spouse) with your Singaporean or SPR child and apply under the HDB Public Scheme which allows you to purchase BTOs that are larger than the 2-room flexi flats.,btohqsg
Yeah a friend in the banking industry is helping to look into this now but bank loan has its own challenge with the higher downpayment and all. Stress üòÇ,btohqsg
Yeah we SBF for a 5-room but now worried cannot get sufficient loan amount,btohqsg
If you have a child from the marriage and the child is a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Resident  you can buy a flat under the Public Scheme.,btohqsg
Im afraid its not possible for new flats irregardless BTO/SBF. It should remain status quo as the point of application till key collection,btohqsg
see how much the bank can loan you.... otherwise  either you wait or you sacrifice for a smaller size,btohqsg
But right  <$200k can get what sia hahaha,btohqsg
4rm near orchid country club on the ulu side,btohqsg
I mean have to shell out cash lah,btohqsg
if the bank can loan higher  that'd be great,btohqsg
Cannot too ulu have a kid hahaha the worst case scenario is to wait for my PR then apply again liao if all else fails üòî,btohqsg
basically combined pay multiply by 65 to aga aga know the loan amount,btohqsg
Then confirm enough if it's so simple haha. Household is 5-figure just wish HDB/bank/whoever would kindly consider this and not just 1 income,btohqsg
Earn how many X more also no use if cannot get mortgage loan to cover the SBF price üòîI consider myself a HENRY (high income not rich yet) so many people ask us to get private property instead but that's really not sustainable as we also have a child.,btohqsg
I read it somewhere dont remember d,btohqsg
xw:anyway the day the accrued interest starts on the principle amount is upon signing the LOA aka 2nd appointmentexample if you made $40k down-payment via OA  the AI starts to compound,btohqsg
First year of AI $1k  2nd year $1025,btohqsg
for $60k payment  the AI would be $6k on the 4th year before your house is ready,btohqsg
hi guys! I'm new here ! may I know who's in senja ridges telegram can separately thank you,btohqsg

I see I see. Thanks a lot!,btohqsg
Hi guysWhat is the maximum years that HDB gives loan for aged 26 ? Does our age really matter ? ü§î,btohqsg
Anyidea what's the max they can offer ?,btohqsg
The maximum loan repayment period for HDB loans is¬†65 years¬†minus buyer's age or¬†30 years  whichever is shorter. The maximum loan repayment period for loans taken through financial institutions is¬†35 years. 5. The maximum age at which the loan must be repaid is¬†65 years old¬†*.,btohqsg
The maximum age at which the loan must be repaid is 65 years old *.6. For users aged 21-54  the program assumes the loan is repaid by 55. For users aged 55-64  the loan is assumed to be repaid by 65 *.,btohqsg

Hihi! Just wondering if owning a resale flat means that we would be given a lower priority (balloting etc) for BTO?My BF and I are first time buyers and are looking to apply for a BTO unit but given the current projected waiting times (5 years!)  we‚Äôre wondering if we should get a resale flat while we wait.,btohqsg
you'll be first timer next time upon balloting for BTO  that is if you are not taking the grant upon getting resale,btohqsg
got grant for resale means you're giving up your first timer chance as well  for future BTO,btohqsg
even if you're second timer  there won't be guarantee you get crap ballot number for BTO,btohqsg
ever considered SBF? shorter time frame but it costs more,btohqsg
difference can be up to $30k increase from the pricing upon BTO launch,btohqsg
Why is sbf price hiked up?,btohqsg
maybe due to shorter waiting time?,btohqsg
Hi how long does it takes for the bto to be ready?,btohqsg
currently shld be 5 to 7 yrs,btohqsg
This is for the new launch?,btohqsg
Mine is from the 2018 launch. I heard there will be 9 months delay. Is that true?,btohqsg
So if market dips  sbf price dips?,btohqsg
think cheapest & fastest to get an unit is via Open Booking,btohqsg
We checked! But the units are also quite limited üòÖKeeping our fingers crossed for the May launch next year ü§û,btohqsg
Hi  I have receive letter from HDB for the ballot count for my BTO on november,btohqsg

there is still one plot beside it,btohqsg
the plot is opposite wwp too,btohqsg
but I'm not sure is it reserved for HDB,btohqsg

Hi all  just joined this group. Does anyone know if I am midway thru my resale MOP  can I apply for BTO?And if so I must apply for those that expected TOP on or after my current MOP right?How much time do I have to sell the current flat after taking BTO keys?Thanks in advance,btohqsg
Also  would my situation affect my ballot chances,btohqsg
there were many trying their luck in BTO despite MOP not met,btohqsg
HDB gives you 6 months to dispose your flat after key collection,btohqsg
2nd timer has much lower chance in getting a number,btohqsg
just try  because I know there are a number getting balloted despite MOP not met but some are first timer as they never get any grant upon getting their resale flat,btohqsg
for mature estate  5% are allocated to 2nd timer,btohqsg
Need to complete your MOP than you can apply your BTO.,btohqsg
