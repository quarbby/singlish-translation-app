i think understanding your care recipient condition and seeing through your care recipient perspective - is still something that many of us are learning  having dealt with special needs i think at times its difficult to understand what the recipient is facing especially when they go into spasms / and passive aggressiveness - i think as a caregiver you need to learn to be calm when handling such recipients  because is not that they want to behave this way but rather their disorder causes them to behave this way  are there tips to better handle passive aggressiveness care recipients?,btohqsg
I use to think my care recipient's depression is very frustrating  why can't she snap out of it or be stronger to deal with it  but as time goes by i realized that unfortunately  our care recipients' situation are not within their control... we're the only ones with the choice to control our behavior and deal with the problem.im sure many of you have the same thoughts at some point of your caregiving journey as i do  is the realization that the only way to deal with it is to fully understand what our care recipient is facing  and that it is only us ourselves have to find ways to deal with the anger and devise with better options or minimize the damage as much as possible.1) Understand their situation  from doctor or phychiatrist2) understand what triggers you and find ways to manage it  or take a moment to yourself before reacting3) understand that showing support to them  helping them to understand you  is better than negative responsesthat's my 2 cent worth of thoughts !,btohqsg

As the Wuhan coronavirus situation evolves  we are stepping up precautionary measures in our social and community services.We are reaching out to our frontline social services - for example  Early Intervention Centres (EIPIC)  Disability Day Activity Centres  Family Service Centres  Student Care Centres  Social Service Offices  social residential facilities such as children's home and senior group homes  and morehttps://go.gov.sg/msf-directories- who have sustained interaction with vulnerable groups (such as children and seniors) to implement the following measures.Staff who have returned or are returning to Singapore after visiting Mainland China should:(1) inform their institutions of their travel history and;(2) take a Leave of Absence (LOA) for 14 days upon their return.This applies to all affected staff returning to Singapore:(a) on and from tomorrow  28 Jan 2020  as well as(b) between 14 – 27 Jan 2020.Counting from the date of return to Singapore  they should return to work only on the 15th day.This is a precautionary measure to protect those whom we collectively serve  as well as our social service and community workers.To illustrate:i. If a social service worker returns to Singapore from Mainland China tomorrow 28 Jan 2020 (Day 0)  they may return to work on 12 Feb 2020 (Day 15)  provided they are well.ii. If they had returned to Singapore from Mainland China on 14 Jan 2020 (Day 0)  they may return to work on 29 Jan 2020 (Day 15).iii. If they will be returning to Singapore from Mainland China on 3 Feb 2020 (Day 0)  they may return to work on 18 Feb 2020 (Day 15).Employers should grant the LOA as paid leave over and above the affected staff's annual leave entitlement  and monitor their health.Students in Student Care Centres  children in EIPIC centres/PPIPs and service users enrolled with social/community-based facilities (e.g. Day Activity Centres) with a travel history to Mainland China in the last 14 days are also advised to stay away from the centres and from crowded places  and to monitor their health closely.We seek your understanding and support for these measures. Let's keep our community  our families and our children safe and healthy together.For information on ECDA’s Preschool advisory visithttps://go.gov.sg/ecda-advisoryYou can get the latest on the Wuhan coronavirus and other important Government information by signing up for thegov.sgWhatsApp channel (https://go.gov.sg/whatsapp) or at the MOH website (www.moh.gov.sg).,btohqsg

The Ministry of Health (MOH) had stepped up our risk assessment from DORSCON Yellow to DORSCON Orange on 7 February.Whatever the situation  we can each do our part. One  observe personal hygiene – wash your hands often  and avoid touching your eyes or face unnecessarily. Two  take your temperature twice daily. And three  if you are not well  please avoid crowded places and see a doctor immediately. These simple steps do not take much effort  but if we all do them  they will go a long way towards containing the spread of the virus.,btohqsg
For events participants  MOH recommends the following precautions:— Individuals who are unwell should not attend. They should avoid public spaces and contact with others  and instead seek medical attention. Any staff or participant who becomes unwell during the event should leave immediately to seek appropriate medical attention.— Individuals placed on LOA should not attend events. They are strongly advised to remain at home and minimise their time spent in public spaces.— Individuals with recent travel history to mainland China  in particular Hubei province  within the last 14 days should not attend.— Individuals who are well do not need to wear masks.— Individuals should remain vigilant and practise good personal hygiene  such as washing their hands regularly and avoiding touching their face.— Avoid shaking hands with other event participants  and consider adopting alternative greetings.,btohqsg
For this period of time (until the DORSCON status is changed for the better)  please do check with the events website or organisers to ensure that the events are still ongoing if you are still keen to attend. Especially for the upcoming events that you have signed up previously. And please do heed the advice from MOH on the recommended practices to keep yourself healthy too. 🤗,btohqsg

Pass this on. Makes sense why youngsters who are fit and well can also succumb to covid-19 yet some older patients may get away with a mild flu like illnessI’ve just been sent thisThis was sent to me by a friend Bert (a charge nurse) who I worked with at NHS 24. It’s written by his doctor colleague currently working with seriously ill coronavirus patients - and in despair as to why anyone is still socialising.Viral load is the key to how coronavirus affects each person. This explanation is clear and helpful as to why as little social contact as possible is now crucial  gives a clue how to  manage it .... the Govt should have explained this at the outset.Why do we need to shut places where people group?Remember this: VIRAL LOADThere will be a lot about this. Why is it important?With this virus  the amount of virus in your blood at first infection directly relates to the severity of the illness you will suffer. This isn’t unusual - HIV management is all about reducing viral load to keep people alive longer. BUT it’s very important in COVID-19.So if you are in  say  a pub or religious building or entertainment venue with 200 people and a large number don’t have symptoms but are shedding  you are breathing in lots of droplets per minute and absorbing a high load of the virus. In a crowded space. They become ill over the next 48 hours. You then three days later wonder why you can’t breathe and end up in hospital. You’d decided because you were young and healthy it wasn’t going to be a problem. Wrong.Fortunately but unfortunately because the elderly are isolating quite well  the initial UK data suggests that all age groups above 20 are almost equally represented in ICUs in England. Most of the cases are in London but the wave is moving outwards.This means that being under 60 and fit and well doesn’t seem to be as protective as we thought. Why? Viral load.This may be skewed simply by the fact that too many Londoners didn’t do as asked and congregated in large groups in confined spaces and got a large initial viral load. They then went home and infected their wider families. Which is why  as London is overwhelmed  we need to shut everything down to save the rest of the UK. We are a week at most behind London.Our sympathies go out to the families affected in London and the critical care teams battling right now to save as many as they can.If I sit with one person and catch this virus  I get a small viral load. My immune system will start to fight it and by the time the virus starts replicating  I’m ready to kill it.No medicines will help this process meaningfully hence there is no “cure” for this virus. All we can do is support you with a ventilator and hope your immune system can catch up fast enough.If I sit in the same room with six people  all shedding I get six times the initial dose. The rise in viral load is faster than my immune system can cope with and it is overrun. I then become critically ill and need me (or someone of my specialty) to fix it instead of just being at home and being ok in the end.THIS BIT IS IMPORTANT:If you are a large family group  remember that by being ill and in the same room  you will make each other ill or “more ill”. If you get sick  isolate just yourself to one room and stay there. Don’t all sit in one room coughing. You will increase the viral load for all of you  reducing your survival rate.A family of six people may produce double the droplets of a family of three in the same space. Maths is important.If one of you is symptomatic  assume you are all shedding and make sure you keep some space.Parents are getting it from their kids because no one is going to stop comforting their child (nor should they) so the parent gets a big hit as well as the child. I don’t think that can be helped.REMEMBER: THINK ABOUT VIRAL LOADIt could save your life or your child’s.Coventry and Warwickshire - it’s up to you now. We are preparing for the worst but we are hoping for the best from you. Please help us to help you. Stay home and take this seriously now bef,btohqsg

Support for Caregivers Throughout the COVID-19 CrisisCaring for someone with mental health issues (including dementia) can often be a long  frustrating and stressful journey. The COVID-19 Circuit Breaker measures seek to curb the spread of the virus by getting all Singapore residents to stay home and reduce physical contact. This will undoubtedly add to the burden of caregiving and increase the feeling of loneliness and social isolation.For CAL  we have to stop all face to face activities and withdraw our staff from the Caregivers Support Centre (CSC) at the Institute of Mental Health  as well as from various hospitals around Singapore. Since 7 April  we have had to close our head office at Valley Point too. That’s really painful for us because that’s where we have held many activities to engage and equip our caregivers and to help them find new friends and support from others who are just like them.We will not be stopped by COVID-19. We will adapt and find new ways of connecting and engaging with our existing pool of caregivers.

However  this has created issues like loneliness and isolation.As such  Ageless Online with U 3RD AGE are starting an initiative called Project BUDDY to get volunteers to call these seniors  who could use a friendly voice on the other end. This project is being supported by the Council for Third Age.* If you are 60 and above and want to participate  you can at:https://tinyurl.com/ProjectBuddy* If you want to volunteer (all ages are welcome)  sign up at:https://tinyurl.com/projectBuddy-volunteer,btohqsg

I see  Adrian. A few of my students have mental health issues and someone has been harassing me over the last 6 months to 1 year. I heard he had gotten mental health issues when he was in MOE. I can handle students with mental health issues as I have counselling credentials but the malicious person who keeps harassing me (I suspect paranoid schizophrenia) is making me really annoyed...,btohqsg
I am threatening legal action  and have already written to MOE about it... hope it resolves 😌,btohqsg
oh no... i hope things will get better for you,btohqsg
would you like to speak to a counsellor too to seek their opinion? i could probably check with some of them for you,btohqsg
I cannot understand how someone can get so annoyed with me just because I had posted my salary last year online... sigh. He set up multiple accounts to harass me on several tutor chat groups. Mmm   I haven't tried reconciling with him. I tried ignoring but he keeps defaming me. So I got a little aggressive by writing to MOE. Seems his condition is quite bad so it has not resolved yet 😒 wonder if it has to do with COVID. I will let you know if I need help! Thank you...,btohqsg
Seems the legal route is not foolproof for those who are not well psychologically.,btohqsg
it can be tricky in such situation. i understand your struggle. please stay positive and do seek 2nd opinions which may help you in your situation.,btohqsg

Depression is a very sad thing. Sigh  thankfully I was cured of it more than a decade ago. My family member has been down with it for very long and I see no end in sight 😱,btohqsg
ahh.. i'm not so sure  i usually work with Nurse Lily there who has been a great friend and a great guidance to me in my volunteering and caregiving journey,btohqsg
yes indeed. we have to take care of ourselves to stay strong and be a positive influence for them :),btohqsg
Does your parent have existential depression? I sometimes get an existential crisis (not too bad that I cant function and nowhere close to clinical depression having experienced it 12 years back). But I fear existential depression in my  50s or 60s😱,btohqsg

The number of people living with dementia in Singapore is forecast to grow from over 82 000 in 2018 to 240 000 people by 2050. Unfortunately  dementia stigma is still very prevalent in Singapore  as discovered in a nationwide survey by Alzheimer’s Disease Association (ADA) and Singapore Management University (SMU) in 2019. The ‘Remember.For.Me’ survey revealed that among persons with dementia interviewed  3 in 4 felt rejection and loneliness  and more than 1 in 2 felt that others acted as though they are less competent due to their condition.Using the appropriate languageis an important step to reduce dementia stigma and enable persons with dementia to live with dignity in their own homes and our communities.Click and read the link below:https://alz.org.sg/wordshurt/,btohqsg

hi Bosco  care to share with us what have been going on for you? so that we can see how to help you or at least share with you how we deal with our caregiving issues too?,btohqsg
was it due to dementia? or mental health related?,btohqsg
i understand  i used to face the same situation with my mother previously until we seek help officially for it to mediate,btohqsg
are you getting support from any organization or peer support group?,btohqsg
can i bring this conversation to you privately? so that i can give you some advice and referral to get some advice? but pls feel free to ask any other caregiver related questions here  i'm sure the rest will be able to support you along the way - you're not alone,btohqsg
Stay strong! If there is anything I can help  please do let me know. We as caregivers need support from time to time always,btohqsg
Stay strong  I have been a caregiver to someone in the household with mental health issues too. There are times I feel the same  just want to leave everything...What worked for me was talking to someone with no judgements of my negativity  I'm thankful for that pillar of support. I started journaling too  it helped me to acknowledge my feelings  accept them and then reframe it into something more positive. Also I firmly believe that the person with mental health didn't mean to hurt us  they are also trying to cope in ways that maybe we can't understand. But as long as they are trying  I felt that I should try too.Hope that by sharing how I cope  can encourage you too ❤️,btohqsg

Helping out a friend. Very interesting. Could benefit many of us as caregivers.We're from CoverCare and we're hoping to develop an insurance product that will allow independent Singaporean workers to access a cash payout when they are too sick to work  or can’t work because they have to look after a loved one. Our primary motivation is to improve the economic security of workers. But we expect to be able to have a positive impact on workers health and well-being. More broadly  we think there will be flow-on benefits for public health and productivity.We're currently running a survey of 'own account workers' in Singapore - basically anyone who works but doesn't have sick leave benefits. This will help us assess the needs of the community and their appetite for insurance. We will give away S$40 prizes to five lucky (randomly selected) survey respondents after the survey closes on 31st March.https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TeamCC_SG,btohqsg
